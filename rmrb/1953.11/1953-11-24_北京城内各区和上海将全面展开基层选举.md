    Basic-Level Elections to be Fully Launched in All Districts of Beijing and Shanghai
    After thorough preparation, Beijing's basic-level election work is about to be fully launched in all districts of the city. The city's basic-level election work will be carried out in two batches: the urban districts will start first, and the suburban districts will follow slightly later.
    Four thousand cadres participating in the election work began intensive training on November 18. The central and North China-level leading organs attach great importance to the capital's general election work and have transferred 1,331 cadres (including 80 from the North China level) to participate in the capital's general election movement. In addition to participating in the election work in the Xidan District, this group of cadres will participate in intensive training and study together with the cadres from Beijing participating in the election work. During the scheduled ten-day training period, everyone will collectively hear reports on the basic-level election work from Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and other responsible persons, and will organize discussions by district to clarify policies, master methods, and truly and fully promote the spirit of democracy to ensure the smooth progress of the election work.
    In preparation for the full launch of elections in urban areas, people's representative conferences at all district levels have held meetings to study how to mobilize the broad masses of people to enthusiastically participate in the general election. Election committees at all district levels, with the participation of representatives from all sectors, have actively carried out various preparatory work. In order to further gain experience and steadily advance the city's general election work, after Beijing concluded the pilot projects of basic-level elections in the Anfu Hutong police station jurisdiction in the city and the Caigongzhuang and Guanzhuang townships in the suburbs, it took the lead in starting basic-level elections in the entire Xidan District. At present, people's election courts in all districts have been established. The division of electoral districts has also been completed, with a total of 172 electoral districts divided in the seven urban districts for elections.
    Preparations for general election publicity are largely in place. More than 1,500 reporters are studying together with the cadres participating in the general election. The Beijing Election Committee has compiled and printed a large number of publicity materials, and more than 30,000 copies have been distributed to various districts. Beijing's literary and art workers are also actively participating in the general election publicity, writing various propaganda products such as street plays, clapper talks, and comic dialogues. Various districts have also organized wired broadcasting stations.
    People from all walks of life in Beijing, who have rich democratic lives, are actively preparing to participate in the general election. More than 3,000 grassroots trade union cadres and street activists in Chongwen, Xuanwu, Dongdan, and other districts have actively studied relevant general election documents, preparing to take the lead in participating in the general election. Amateur theatrical troupes in factories and enterprises in Dongdan District are rehearsing programs that promote the general election through storytelling and singing. Shop workers and folk artists have organized themselves and, under the leadership of the cultural centers in various districts, are conducting singing and practice of literary and artistic programs on the general election. The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation recently convened a city-wide women's representative conference of more than 3,000 people, calling on women throughout the city to actively participate in the election movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Shanghai's basic-level election work will fully begin in the latter half of this month. More than 600 general election work teams across the city entered electoral districts in early November, and a broad and in-depth general election publicity campaign is being carried out throughout the city in close combination with the publicity and education on the general line of the state during the transition period. More than 3,000 reporters at the municipal and district levels have been dispatched to carry out vigorous publicity of the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period in various government agencies, factories, and streets, and to provide in-depth explanations and reports to the masses in conjunction with the general election work. More than 50,000 trained propagandists have also launched publicity activities among the people throughout the city. At present, eye-catching slogans have appeared in many factories and streets throughout the city, and shop windows are decorated with colorful propaganda pictures. People are welcoming the general election as if it were a grand festival.
    Shanghai's basic-level election work has undergone two or three months of full preparation and meticulous planning. Electoral districts are divided according to Shanghai's characteristics of concentrated population, high mobility, numerous units, and complex industries. In urban areas, electoral districts are generally divided into more than 670 electoral districts according to natural conditions and the living and working conditions of residents. Some of these electoral districts include different units such as factories, government agencies, schools, and residents; some include units that cross administrative districts or electoral districts; some are mainly large factories that are separately divided into electoral districts; and some are state-owned factories that are jointly divided into electoral districts with neighborhoods. In suburban areas, there are many factories and schools with large numbers of people, residential areas without townships, and large-scale construction sites, which are also separately or jointly divided into electoral districts directly under the jurisdiction of the suburbs. For the more than 80,000 floating residents on the Huangpu River and Suzhou River and other rivers, the Shanghai Water Area Election Committee has also divided them into 33 electoral districts separately or jointly according to their characteristics. In addition, because the more than 20,000 ethnic minority people scattered in Shanghai cannot be divided into separate electoral districts, they will jointly participate in the basic-level elections with local residents.
    The Shanghai Election Committee has transferred a large number of cadres to participate in the general election work. More than 30,000 cadres transferred from various government agencies, troops, factories, shops, and neighborhoods have participated in the general election work in various electoral districts after training. The district committees of the Chinese Communist Party in various districts have designated cadres to lead the general election full-time. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has also mobilized trade union organizations at all levels to assist local election authorities in doing a good job in the general election.

    北京城内各区和上海将全面展开基层选举
    北京市的基层选举工作，经过充分准备，即将在城内各区全面展开。全市基层选举工作分两批进行：城内各区首先开始，郊区稍迟一步进行。
    四千个参加选举工作的干部，十一月十八日已开始集中训练。中央与华北一级的领导机关，对首都普选工作极为重视，已抽调了一千三百三十一个干部（内华北一级八十人）投入首都普选运动。这一批干部除已参加西单区选举工作外，其余的和北京市参加选举工作的干部在一起参加了集训学习。在预定的十天训练期间内，大家将集体听到北京市人民政府副市长张友渔及其他负责人关于基层选举工作的报告，并分区组织讨论，求得明确政策、掌握方法，能真正充分发扬民主精神，以保证选举工作的顺利进行。
    为准备城区选举全面展开，各区各界人民代表会议都曾举行会议，研究如何动员广大人民热烈参加普选问题。有各界代表人物参加的各区选举委员会已积极地展开了种种准备工作。为进一步取得经验，使全市普选工作稳步前进，北京市结束了在城内安福胡同派出所辖区和郊区蔡公庄、关庄两个乡的基层选举典型试办之后，又在西单区全区先行一步开始了基层选举。目前，各区普选人民法庭都已成立。选区的划分也已完毕，城内七个区共划分一百七十二个选区进行选举。
    普选宣传的准备工作已大体就绪。一千五百多名报告员正在和参加普选的干部一起进行学习。北京市选举委员会编写与印发了大量的宣传材料，现已有三万多份发至各区。北京市的文艺工作者也积极参加普选宣传，编写了街头剧、快板、相声等多种宣传品。各区并组织了有线广播站。
    有着丰富民主生活的北京市各阶层人民，正在积极准备投入普选。崇文、宣武、东单等区的三千余工会基层干部与街道积极分子，积极进行了有关普选文件的学习，准备带头参加普选。东单区各工厂、企业中的业余剧团，正在排演说唱普选的节目。店员工人与市民中的艺人已经组织起来，在各区文化馆的领导下，进行关于普选文艺节目的演唱和练习。北京市民主妇女联合会日前召开了全市三千余人的妇女代表大会，号召全市妇女积极参加选举运动。（新华社）
    上海市基层选举工作将在本月下旬全面开始。全市六百多个普选工作队已在十一月上旬进入选区工作，一个广泛深入的普选宣传活动，正密切结合着关于国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育在全市展开。市、区两级报告员三千多人已分头出动，在全市各机关、工厂、街道大张旗鼓地进行国家在过渡时期总路线和总任务的宣传，并结合普选工作，向群众作深入的解释报告。经过训练的五万多宣传员也向全市人民展开了宣传活动。目前，全市许多工厂和街道上都出现了醒目的标语，商店橱窗里装饰了彩色的宣传图画。人们像对待盛大节日一样地迎接普选的到来。
    上海市的基层选举工作，曾经过两三个月的充分准备与细致的筹划。根据上海市人口集中、流动性大、单位繁多和行业复杂等特点划分选区。市区一般按自然条件和居民居住、工作情况，划分为六百七十多个选区。其中有的选区包括了工厂、机关、学校和居民等不同单位；有的包括跨越行政区或选区的单位；有的以大工厂为主单独划为选区；有的以国营工厂带里弄联合划为选区。郊区中有许多人数众多的工厂、学校，有不设乡镇的住宅区和规模较大的建筑工地，也都单独或联合划为郊区的直属选区。对流动在黄浦江与苏州河等河流之间的八万多水上居民，上海市水上区选举委员会也根据他们的特点联合或单独划分为三十三个选区。此外，对散居在上海市的两万多少数民族人民，因不能单独划成选区，将与当地居民联合参加基层选举。
    上海市选举委员会抽调了大批干部参加普选工作。从各机关、部队、工厂和商店、里弄中抽调的三万多名干部，经过训练后已参加各选区普选工作。各区的中共区委员会已指定干部专职领导普选。上海市总工会也动员了各级工会组织，协助当地选举机关做好普选工作。（新华社）
