The state-owned Fangqiu Lake Tractor Farm in Mentai Zi, Fengyang County, Anhui Province, used its spare time to send tractors to help the Li Shulan mutual aid team in the nearby Pubao Gang Village plant wheat. This event deeply educated the farmers of the whole village.

On the afternoon of October 12th, three tractors from the farm, carrying plows, harrows, and seeders, drove into the fields of the Li Shulan mutual aid team amidst the warm welcome of the Pubao Gang Village farmers. When the tractors started plowing the land, they plowed seven inches deep according to the team members' wishes. The team members watched intently behind the tractors. When a layer of black soil rolled up with the "four-bottom plow," a burst of laughter erupted in the fields.

In the two days of the 12th and 13th, the three tractors worked a total of eight hours, with an efficiency more than 20 times faster than manual labor, deeply plowing all 26.5 mu of land of the Li Shulan mutual aid team once, finely harrowing it once, evenly sowing wheat, and completely achieving row planting with close spacing. While plowing, the village farmers surrounded the field ridges to watch. After the plowing was finished, everyone unanimously acknowledged: the quality of cultivation was good, the plowing depth was six or seven inches, the hard, large clods of soil were harrowed very finely, the sowing depth was consistent, and the wheat grains were evenly distributed.

This time, the farm plowed for the masses, driving the tractors from the farm to the mutual aid team, which was several miles away, and the efficiency of the machines could not be fully utilized on small plots of land, resulting in more empty runs, so the fuel cost was higher than plowing on a large area.

The Li Shulan mutual aid team's request for the farm to send tractors to sow wheat gave all the villagers a better education. Everyone understood that to use tractors for cultivation in the future, it is necessary to first lay a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation and gradually cultivate collectivized thinking. All nine mutual aid teams in the village studied this matter, and everyone resolved to work hard to consolidate the mutual aid teams and gradually create conditions for the future collectivization and mechanization of agriculture. After this study, four mutual aid teams that were about to collapse were consolidated. In addition, four households, including Chai Yuannan, agreed to form a mutual aid team because their land was connected. The members of the Li Shulan mutual aid team are even preparing to gradually transform their mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative.

### 方邱湖农场用拖拉机帮李树兰互助组种麦  鼓舞了农民互助合作的热情

    方邱湖农场用拖拉机帮李树兰互助组种麦
    鼓舞了农民互助合作的热情
    安徽省凤阳县门台子国营方邱湖机耕农场，利用空隙时间，派拖拉机帮助附近蒲包岗村的李树兰互助组种麦。这件事使全村农民受到了深刻的教育。
    在十月十二日的下午，农场的三架拖拉机，带着犁、耙、播种机，在蒲包岗村农民的热烈欢迎下，开到了李树兰互助组的地里。拖拉机开始耕地时，按照组员们的意见，下犁七寸深。组员们出神地跟在拖拉机后面观看。当一层乌黑的泥土随着“四铧犁”翻滚上来时，田地里轰起了一片欢笑声。
    在十二、十三两天中，三部拖拉机共计工作了八个钟头，以快于人工二十多倍的效率，把李树兰互助组的二十六亩五分地全部深耕了一遍，细耙一遍，均匀地种上小麦，并完全做到条播密植。耕种时，村里农民围着田埂参观。耕种结束，大家一致承认：耕作质量好，耕深有六、七寸，硬大的土块耙得很碎，播种深浅一致，麦粒分布均匀。
    农场这次代群众耕种，把拖拉机从农场开到互助组，要走好几里路，而且在小块土地上不能发挥机器的效能，空跑趟数较多，所以化的油料成本，比在大面积上耕种的要高些。
    李树兰互助组请农场派拖拉机来播种小麦，使全村农民受到了一次更好的教育。大家懂得了将来要用拖拉机耕种，必须首先打好互助合作的基础和逐步培养集体化思想。全村九个互助组围绕这件事进行了学习，大家决心努力巩固互助组，逐步为将来农业的集体化和机械化创造条件。经过这次学习，有四个将要垮台的互助组巩固下来了。另有柴园南等四户，因土地相连，大家同意组成了一个互助组。李树兰互助组的组员们更准备逐步把他们的互助组转为农业生产合作社。
