The Chinese people, with the same joy and excitement as the Soviet people, celebrate the greatest festival in human history – the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

On this day, the Chinese people extend the warmest fraternal congratulations to their dearest friends – the Soviet people who are engaged in the great communist and peaceful construction.

After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, signed with the personal participation of the great Stalin and Mao Zedong, forged a great and unbreakable alliance between the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union. In the past few years, the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union has rapidly developed and consolidated on the basis of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

People have already seen how great an impact the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has had on the cause of safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet Union, China, and the entire peace and democracy camp have achieved great success in their struggle to win peace in the Far East and the world and to oppose wars of aggression. The Korean armistice is one such great achievement. In order to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, China and the Soviet Union have carried out close cooperation in diplomacy. The Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue have played a significant role in the realization of the Korean armistice. The outcome of the Korean War proves that, due to the powerful existence of the People's Republic of China, the unity of the people of Asian countries, and especially the continuous consolidation and development of the great friendship and unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, the era in which imperialism could arbitrarily invade Asia has gone forever. The people of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and the entire peace and democracy camp are now taking the Korean armistice as a starting point and continuing to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and further relaxation of world tensions. Relying on our great unity and the joint efforts of all peace-loving people in the world, we will undoubtedly be able to defeat the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism and achieve new and greater victories in the cause of defending peace.

The economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union based on "mutual assistance and sincere desire to seek common economic prosperity" has achieved rapid and enormous development in recent years. The Sino-Soviet economic cooperation and the Soviet Union's enormous assistance to our country's economic construction are important factors for our country to quickly complete the task of restoring the national economy and embark on the road of planned construction.

As everyone knows, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, the Soviet Union provided our country with a large amount of material and technical assistance during the extremely difficult period of economic recovery. For example, according to loan agreements and trade agreements, the Soviet Union supplied our country with various machinery, equipment, and materials, helping to solve many difficulties in our country's economic recovery work. The civil aviation company, non-ferrous metal and rare metal company, and petroleum company established by China and the Soviet Union through economic cooperation have helped the development of our country's construction undertakings. It is particularly worth pointing out that the selfless assistance of Soviet experts to our country's construction undertakings over the past four years has been an important condition for the smooth progress of our construction work. Many of our country's huge construction projects, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the Huai River harnessing project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, and the reconstruction and new construction of many factories and mines, have been carried out under the systematic assistance of Soviet experts and the guidance of advanced Soviet experience. The China Changchun Railway, which was carefully managed by Soviet experts and technicians and handed over to our country at the end of last year, is our country's most advanced model railway.

In recent years, China and the Soviet Union have conducted frequent cultural exchanges. From 1949 to 1952, a total of 22 groups were sent from China to the Soviet Union, and a total of 18 groups were sent from the Soviet Union to China. These groups widely conveyed the friendship between the two peoples and exchanged experiences. This year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union and the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union were warmly welcomed in the Soviet Union and gained rich results. In the month or so after returning to China, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union held more than 60 report meetings and symposiums to the people across the country. In addition, they wrote many articles in newspapers and magazines, recording the great achievements they witnessed in the Soviet Union's socialist and communist construction. The unforgettable impressions and feelings brought back by all the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who visited the Soviet Union have greatly encouraged the broad masses of the Chinese people who are building their own motherland.

The publication of the works of Lenin and Stalin in China has greatly developed. From October 1949 to the end of 1952, a total of 38 kinds of Lenin's works were published (including 7 kinds of collections of Lenin and Stalin's works and collections of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's works, and 1 kind of minority language version), with a total of more than 2,135,000 copies printed. From 1949 to June 1953, a total of 41 kinds of Stalin's works were published (including 7 kinds of collections of Lenin and Stalin's works and collections of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's works, and 2 kinds of minority language versions), with a total of more than 6,700,000 copies printed, of which more than 2,970,000 copies were printed in the first half of 1953 alone. It is particularly important that the first volume of Stalin's Complete Works was published and distributed in October this year, with the first edition distributing 1 million copies. The publication of Stalin's Complete Works is a major event in China's publishing industry, and the Chinese people welcome the publication of this great work with great enthusiasm.

The translation and publication of Soviet literary works and other works in China are also developing day by day. Books such as "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "An Ordinary Soldier," and "A Real Man" are widely popular among Chinese youth, and they draw strong ideological strength from these works.

Now the Chinese people are carrying out the construction work of the first year of the first five-year plan with high labor enthusiasm. What gives great encouragement and confidence to our construction is that the glorious path that the Soviet people have taken under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin for more than 30 years and the infinitely rich experience accumulated will serve as the most valuable guide for our national construction. At present, the broad masses of cadres in our country are widely studying the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" and have set off a wave of learning advanced Soviet science and technology and advanced experience in order to better study Lenin and Stalin's theory of socialist construction, learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, and closely integrate with our country's reality to build our motherland.

The Chinese people are steadily transitioning to socialism along the victorious road taken by the great Lenin and Stalin leading the Soviet people.

What gives the Chinese people even greater encouragement is the recent great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet government to our country's economic construction. According to the results of Sino-Soviet consultations, the Soviet Union has decided to provide systematic economic and technical assistance to our country's 141 large-scale enterprises that are newly built and renovated; in this consultation, the Soviet Union generously provided assistance to everything that we needed to do, that we had the conditions to do, but that we could not do on our own. It is indeed an unprecedented initiative for two countries to solve so many enterprise construction problems and plan such long-term and comprehensive assistance in one consultation. In human history, which country, which people, can give such great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance to another country? Apart from the socialist country of the Soviet Union, it is impossible to find another one.

Chairman Mao, in his telegram of thanks to Chairman Malenkov on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, pointed out the great significance of this assistance. He said: "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to give systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and renovation of 91 new enterprises in China and 50 enterprises that are being built and renovated, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry under the effort of learning from the advanced experience and the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union, which is of extremely great significance to China's industrialization, the gradual transition of China to socialism, and the strengthening of the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

The results of the new Sino-Soviet negotiations have brought the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union to an unprecedented high. The Soviet Union's great assistance to the Chinese people fully demonstrates the deep brotherly relations between China and the Soviet Union and is one of the great examples of a new type of international relations that has never existed in history.

The Chinese people have always deeply understood that strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union is one of the most important tasks of the Chinese people. In the past few years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has done a lot of work nationwide in promoting Sino-Soviet friendship, promoting the masses of people to learn from the Soviet Union, and promoting Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges. Now a new upsurge of friendship with the Soviet Union has formed among the entire people of our country. In order to adapt to this new situation, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association needs new development and transformation. Therefore, starting this year, the Friendship Association began to transform from the organizational form based on individual members in the past to the organizational form based on group members. In this way, major mass organizations with broad representation across the country have become or will become group members of the Friendship Association, and the work of the Friendship Association can be carried out on a broader basis. At present, many mass organizations, such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, which have a large number of members and represent a wide range of classes, have decided to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members. The Friendship Association will no longer be an organization with only 68 million members, but a truly nationwide organization, first and foremost an organization of the broad masses of workers and peasants. This transformation of the organizational form of the Friendship Association is completely in line with the urgent demands of the people across the country to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet Union, and therefore it is completely correct. It has won the warm support of the people across the country and various people's organizations.

The main task of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the future is to carry out mass propaganda work on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union through or in conjunction with various people's organizations and relevant parties under the guidance of the general line and general tasks of national construction, so as to maximize the development of the cause of national construction and the common cause of defending world peace. Our propaganda front will be greatly expanded, our propaganda strength will also be greatly strengthened, and the content and form of propaganda must and will be more enriched.

The work of the Friendship Association has always been carried out with the sincere assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in various forms. This assistance has provided extremely favorable conditions for the smooth progress of the work of the Friendship Association.

With the development of the cause of national construction, as well as due to many new measures in the work of the Friendship Association, the work of the Friendship Association will greatly develop forward and will enter a new stage of work.

With the rapid development of our country's national construction and the rapid rise in the strength of the entire peace and democracy camp, the greatest friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union will be infinitely strengthened. This is definitely certain. As Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, said: "The Chinese government and the Chinese people are willing to make unremitting efforts to strengthen the economic cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China in order to jointly strive for the cause of world peace." Long live the Soviet Union, the model of our country's construction and the strong fortress of world peace! Long live the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union—the reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world!

    让中苏两国人民的伟大友谊无限地加强起来
    ——为苏联“真理报”而作
    中苏友好协会总会总干事　钱俊瑞
    中国人民怀着和苏联人民同样欢欣鼓舞的心情来庆祝人类历史中最伟大的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年。
    在这一天，中国人民向自己最亲爱的朋友——正在进行伟大的共产主义和平建设的苏联人民——致最热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，由伟大的斯大林和毛泽东亲自参加下签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，将中苏两国七亿人民结成了伟大的牢不可破的同盟。几年来，中苏两国的伟大友谊在中苏友好同盟互助条约的基础上获得了迅速的发展和巩固。
    人们都已看见：中苏两国人民之间的伟大友谊已对保卫远东及世界和平的事业发生了多么巨大的影响。苏联、中国和整个和平民主阵营为争取远东和世界的和平、反对侵略战争的斗争，已取得了伟大的成就。朝鲜停战就是这种伟大成就之一。为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，中苏两国在外交上进行密切的合作。苏联为和平解决朝鲜问题而作的不懈努力，对朝鲜停战的实现起了重大的作用。朝鲜事件的结果证明，由于中华人民共和国的强大存在，由于亚洲各国人民的团结一致，特别是由于中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结的不断巩固和发展，帝国主义可以任意侵略亚洲的时代已经一去不复返了。苏联、中国、朝鲜和整个和平民主阵营的人民现在正以朝鲜停战为起点，继续为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决和世界紧张局势的进一步缓和而努力。依靠我们的伟大团结和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的共同努力，毫无疑问，我们一定能够击破美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，取得保卫和平事业新的更伟大的胜利。
    中苏两国基于“互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望”的经济合作，几年来获得了迅速和巨大的发展。中苏经济合作和苏联对我国经济建设的巨大援助，是我国得以迅速完成国民经济恢复工作和走上有计划的建设道路的重要因素。
    大家知道，根据中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定，苏联对我国极为艰巨的经济恢复时期给予了大量的物质和技术援助。例如根据贷款协定和贸易协定，苏联供给了我国以各种机器设备和器材，帮助解决了我国恢复经济工作中的许多困难。中苏以经济合作方式开办的民用航空公司、有色金属及稀有金属公司、石油公司，帮助了我国建设事业的发展。特别值得指出的是四年来苏联专家对我国建设事业作了忘我的帮助，这是我们建设工作得以顺利进行的一个重要条件。我国许多巨大建设工程，如成渝铁路、天兰铁路、治淮工程和荆江分洪及许多厂矿的改建和新建，都是在苏联专家的系统的帮助和苏联先进经验的指导下进行的。由苏联专家和技术人员精心经营管理，在去年年底移交我国的中国长春铁路，是我国最先进的模范铁路。
    几年来，中苏两国进行了频繁的文化交流工作。自一九四九年到一九五二年，由中国派到苏联去的团体共有二十二个，由苏联派到中国来的共有十八个。这些团体广泛地传达了两国人民的友谊和交流了双方的经验。今年我国派到苏联的中苏友好协会赴苏参观团和中国科学院访苏代表团，在苏联受到了热烈的欢迎并得到了丰富的收获。中苏友好协会赴苏参观团在归国后的一个多月中，即向全国人民进行了六十余次报告会和座谈会，此外还在报章杂志上写了许多文章，记述他们亲眼看见的苏联进行社会主义和共产主义建设的伟大成就。所有访问过苏联回来的我国工人、农民、知识分子带回来的永远不能忘怀的印象和观感，都给予了正在建设自己祖国的广大中国人民以极大的鼓舞。
    列宁和斯大林的著作在中国的出版工作已有了极大的发展。列宁的著作自一九四九年十月至一九五二年底，共出版了三十八种（包括列、斯著作合辑及马、恩、列、斯著作合辑七种，少数民族文字版本一种），印数共达二百一十三万五千多册。斯大林的著作从一九四九年至一九五三年六月，共出版了四十一种（包括列、斯著作合辑及马、恩、列、斯著作合辑七种及少数民族文字版本二种），印数共达六百七十万多册，其中仅一九五三年上半年印数即达二百九十七万册。特别重要的是斯大林全集第一卷已在今年十月间出版发行，第一版即发行了一百万册。斯大林全集的出版是中国出版事业上一个重大事件，中国人民以极大的热情欢迎这一伟大著作的出版。
    苏联文学著作和其他各项著作在中国的翻译和出版也在日益发展。像“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“普通一兵”、“真正的人”等书正在中国青年中广泛流行着，他们从这些著作中吸取坚强的思想力量。
    现在中国人民正以高涨的劳动热情进行第一个五年计划的第一年度的建设工作。给我们的建设以巨大鼓舞和信心的是，三十多年来，苏联人民在列宁、斯大林领导下走过的光荣的道路，积累下来的无限丰富的经验，将作为我们国家建设的最宝贵的指针。现在，我国广大干部正在广泛地学习“联共（布）党史”，掀起了学习苏联先进的科学技术和先进经验的热潮，以便更好地学习列宁、斯大林社会主义建设的理论，学习苏联建设的经验，密切结合我国的实际，来建设我们的祖国。
    中国人民正在沿着伟大的列宁、斯大林领导苏联人民所走过的胜利道路，稳步地过渡到社会主义。
    使中国人民感到更大的鼓舞的是最近苏联政府对我国经济建设所作的伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助。根据中苏商谈的结果，苏联决定对我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的企业，进行系统的经济的和技术的援助；在这次商谈中，苏联对我们一切必要办，有条件办，而单靠我们自己办不到的，都慨予援助。两个国家在一次商谈中，解决了这样多的企业建设问题，规划了这样长久的和全面的援助，确实是空前未有的创举。在人类历史上，有那一个国家，有那一国人民，能够给别个国家以这样伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助呢？除了社会主义国家苏联以外，是再也找不到的了。
    毛主席在代表中国政府和中国人民致马林科夫主席的谢电中，指出了这些援助的伟大意义。他说：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    新的中苏谈判的成果使中苏两国的友好合作，达到了空前未有的高涨。苏联对中国人民的这种伟大的援助，充分说明了中苏两国的深厚的兄弟般的关系，是历史上从来没有过的新型国际关系的伟大范例之一。
    中国人民一向深切地了解：加强中苏友好和学习苏联是中国人民的头等重要的任务之一。在过去几年来，中苏友好协会在增进中苏友好、推动人民群众学习苏联和促进中苏文化交流等方面，在全国范围内做了许多工作。现在在我国全体人民中间已形成了对苏友好的新的高涨。为了适应这种新的形势，中苏友好协会的工作需要有新的发展和转变。因此，友协从今年起开始从过去以个人会员为基础的组织形式转变为以团体会员为基础。这样，全国具有广大代表性的各大群众组织都已成为、或即将成为友协的团体会员，友协的工作就可以在更广大的基础上进行。目前，如中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中国新民主主义青年团、中国文学艺术界联合会等许多拥有广大群众、代表广大阶层的群众组织，都已决定加入中苏友好协会为团体会员。友协将不再是只有六千八百万会员的组织，而是真正的全民性的、首先是广大工农群众的组织了。友协组织形式的这一转变，是完全符合全国人民加强中苏友好和学习苏联的迫切要求的，因此是完全正确的。它获得了全国人民和各个人民团体的热烈拥护。
    中苏友好协会今后的主要任务是在国家建设的总路线总任务的照耀下，通过或联合各人民团体和有关方面开展中苏友好和学习苏联的群众宣传工作，以最大地有利于国家建设事业和保卫世界和平的共同事业的发展。我们的宣传阵地将会大大扩大，宣传力量也将会大大加强，而宣传内容和形式也都必须和都会更加丰富起来。
    友协的工作是一直在苏联人民和苏联对外文化协会的各种形式的真诚协助下进行的。这些协助为友协工作的顺利进行提供了极为有利的条件。
    随着国家建设事业的发展，以及由于友协工作方面的许多新措施，友协的工作将大大地向前发展，并将进入一个新的工作阶段。
    随着我国国家建设的飞速发展和整个和平民主阵营的力量的迅速高涨，中苏两国人民的最伟大的友谊将无限加强起来，这是确定无疑的。正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说：“中国政府和中国人民愿以自己的不懈的努力来加强苏中两国的经济合作和友好同盟，以利为世界和平事业的共同奋斗。”我国建设的榜样、世界和平的坚强堡垒苏联万岁！中苏两国的伟大同盟—远东和世界和平的可靠保证—万岁！
