Political work during the completion of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant

He Muzhang, Liu Hanchi, Li Pinjie

Thanks to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Rolling Mill Engineering Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strengthening political work during the completion phase, the handover, acceptance, and other tasks of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant project proceeded smoothly.

The Seamless Steel Tube Plant project was constructed jointly by six specialized engineering companies. In the past, each construction unit worked separately based on the order of work processes and engineering areas. As the completion phase approached, the construction transitioned from a decentralized to a centralized approach, requiring the integration of various components from the entire project into a unified whole. This necessitated close coordination among various types of work; any lack of coordination or problems in any part of the project would affect the overall test run. The complexity of the final stages was also manifested in the large number of project items, the small quantity of work, and the extremely strict technical requirements. In addition, there was a high risk of personal or equipment accidents during the power-on test run. Another characteristic of the completion phase was the increase in the number of units on the construction site, but the reduction in personnel. However, the number of visitors from various parties increased, with people coming and going within the plant, making management more difficult.

The ideological sentiments of the workers also differed from those during the large-scale construction phase. Generally, they recognized the significance of completing the Seamless Steel Tube Plant project ahead of schedule and actively strived to achieve early completion. However, many workers also held two types of thoughts: One was a lack of a sense of responsibility for the project to the end, adopting a "push it out" or "pass the buck" attitude towards handover and acceptance work, even saying that the acceptance work was not good and that the production department was deliberately "nitpicking" and "finding fault." Workers in the capital construction departments, on the other hand, were "reluctant" to hand over the completed factory, and some even requested to stay and become production workers. However, the political work situation on the construction site was not adapted to the needs of the aforementioned objective situation. Among the six specialized companies contracting for the project, the Rolling Mill Engineering Company was responsible for overall contracting, while the others were subcontracting units. After the main force of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company shifted to other projects in April of this year, there was no unified political work organization on the construction site, and each unit worked on its own. Four radio stations on the construction site broadcast simultaneously, with four different voices intertwined, making it impossible to hear anything clearly. Problems also often occurred in the content of the propaganda due to the lack of unified leadership.

In response to these circumstances, the Rolling Mill Engineering Company transferred cadres to strengthen the political work force on the construction site. Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it also convened a political work conference involving various units related to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. This conference unified thinking and leadership, organized a political work group for the Seamless Steel Tube Plant construction site, and unified leadership over political work during the completion phase. At the same time, it established the general slogan for political work during the completion phase: Launch a production increase and economy campaign for completion, ensure project quality, strive for early completion, greet National Day, and present a gift to Chairman Mao. Subsequently, a large-scale political and ideological education campaign was launched.

The political work group first educated the masses on the significance of early completion. Through this education, all workers recognized that early completion was their greatest contribution to the country, the greatest increase in production and economy, and would have a huge political and economic impact both domestically and internationally. Propaganda workers also specifically calculated for everyone how much wealth the Seamless Steel Tube Plant project could create for the country if it could be put into production one day, ten days, or one month earlier; how many machines this wealth could buy, how large a factory could be built, how many airplanes, tractors, or grains could be bought. Propaganda workers also explained to everyone the driving role of early production of seamless steel tubes in the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation. In this way, all workers concretely recognized the significance of early completion for the country's industrialization and national defense construction. Next, workers were mobilized to discuss the completion plan and launch a production increase and economy completion campaign. Challenge and response campaigns were launched between work shifts and even between individuals, and all workers wrote pledges, which played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the project tasks.

In the process of implementing the responsibility system, the spirit of being responsible for project quality to the end was established through advanced individuals and advanced ideas. Political workers publicized the exemplary actions of Soviet experts in being responsible for quality, promoted the advanced ideas and deeds of Workshop Director Li Ren and Technician Zhang Mifan in being boldly responsible for project quality and responsible to the end, and at the same time criticized the ideas of "fear of responsibility" and "pushing things out." The results of this strengthened labor discipline and the workers' sense of responsibility, laying the foundation for the implementation of various procedures in the test run acceptance.

The political work group also conducted education on the significance of capital construction among workers, overcoming the idea of "reluctance" to hand over the project and encouraging everyone to do a good job in completion and acceptance work.

In resolving the above problems, the political work group carried out the following tasks: 1. Organize comfort and gala events, conduct visualized propaganda. The purpose of organizing comfort and gala events was to boost the workers' work enthusiasm and at the same time improve the relationship between workers in capital construction and production units. During the completion period, the political work group invited the Anshan City or Company Cultural Troupe, Cultural Center, and students to perform three comfort performances. These three comfort performances greatly encouraged the workers, especially the letters of comfort and flower offerings from the Young Pioneers, which deeply moved everyone. Sun Yuxiang, an old worker from the Pipeline Company, said: "The children call us Uncle and Grandpa with every breath. It would be really wrong not to work hard." Therefore, Sun Yuxiang asked the leadership to assign him to complete difficult tasks. The political work group also planned and organized four comfort galas between workers in capital construction and production units, and mobilized them to write letters to each other to encourage each other. Workers in the production units wrote letters to workers in capital construction to express their gratitude and respect; workers in capital construction wrote letters to workers in the production units to welcome them to accept the project as soon as possible, so as to produce wealth for the country as soon as possible. Through these efforts, various erroneous views among workers were gradually corrected, enabling everyone to recognize that the completion of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant was the result of collective labor, and strengthening the unity between workers in capital construction and production units.

During the completion period, the political work group widely used propaganda tools such as blackboards, big-character posters, and slogans, targeting the needs of the project and the problems in the workers' thinking. It also created 34 comic strips with the political and economic significance of early completion and the use of seamless steel tubes as content, arranged on both sides of the sidewalk. This visualized propaganda was the easiest to penetrate into people's hearts. After reading the comic strips, worker Wang Fushan calculated the detailed accounts and said: "We really don't know how great the benefits of completing the project one day earlier are... we must seize the time to work."

2. Give full play to the role of the Party's reporters, propagandists, Party members, and League members. The Party's reporters gave three reports to the workers based on the actual situation during the completion period. The political work group held several meetings with Party members, League members, propagandists, and activists to arrange propaganda content and methods, enabling them to carry out propaganda and mobilization among workers in a timely manner. For example, machine installation technician Wen Futian violated the operating procedures during the test run, causing an accident. Propagandist Xiu Xianyou and others seized this incident to carry out propaganda and education among the workers. The propagandists found that some workers were eager to go to work elsewhere and that individual workers did not pay enough attention to quality, so they put forward the slogans "Don't leave if it's not good, don't leave if it's not (turned) over clearly" and "Do well, turn it over clearly, and guarantee no rework" to the workers. This played a certain role in stabilizing workers' emotions and ensuring quality.

3. Mobilize workers to carry out a quality review movement. During the production increase and economy completion campaign, and the continued implementation of the responsibility system, especially the technical responsibility system and the grass-roots responsibility system, a quality review was conducted on the construction site. At that time, on the one hand, a quality review committee and review team were organized to conduct the review; on the other hand, workers were mobilized to launch a quality review movement. Workers from each construction unit held group meetings, and each worker recalled the quality of the projects they or others had done, recalled the places where problems had occurred, and the places where they did not have enough confidence, and put them all forward, and then conducted inspections. The work was not very smooth at the beginning. Although the workers had already been educated on quality, individual workers still treated quality problems with a perfunctory attitude. Worker Teng Yunwen said: "Even if there is a tiny flaw, the inspector can't see it, just give him a hammer!" Some people were afraid of being "disgraced" if problems were found, and were unwilling to actively conduct inspections; others found it troublesome, thinking that "it's up to others to find the problem, and if they don't find it, just let it go." There were also many non-Party workers waiting to "see the Party members," and they would inspect if the Party members inspected, otherwise they would just let it go. Therefore, on the one hand, the Party organization promptly carried out propaganda and mobilization in response to the ideological situation of the workers, and at the same time called on Party members and League members to take the lead in conducting inspections, so that the masses' quality review work could be carried out smoothly. After the workers were mobilized, a total of 759 quality problems were found, some of which were quite serious. Workers Qi Kaizhong and Qi Wen found three wooden plugs in the oil pipe. If they had not been discovered in time, the oil would not have been able to reach the machine, and the mechanical life would have been affected. Problems like this would have been very difficult to find if only inspection and acceptance personnel had gone to check.

4. Conduct technical propaganda. The technology during the completion period was complex and required strictness. It was not possible to completely solve the problems by relying solely on the enthusiasm of all workers (which was of course very necessary). It was necessary to educate workers to master the technology. In response to this need, the political work group organized Party members, propagandists, technicians, and veteran technicians to vigorously carry out technical propaganda. There were many ways of technical propaganda, the main ones being: (1) Using the ten minutes before work to give technical speeches. The content of the speeches was to introduce the quality and technical safety conditions of the test run the previous day, commend the good, criticize the bad, and explain the reasons for the bad, so that workers would always pay attention to improving quality and ensuring safety. This method has now become an institution. (2) Conduct technical briefings. Before the test run, explain the machine performance to the workers separately, so that the workers know what to expect during the test run to avoid accidents. Workers said: "This is really good. If you don't know the details of the machine, who knows how much 'medicine' to give it." (3) Organize workers to study Soviet expert suggestions and various test run procedures. Sometimes Soviet experts made suggestions, but workers often didn't know how to implement them due to their technical limitations. Before the test run, many test run procedures were developed according to the type of work and machine performance, but workers with low technical skills also didn't understand them. The political work group and relevant units held seminars, reports, etc., to organize workers to study by type of work. This not only adapted to the needs of construction, but also improved the technical level of workers.

During the completion period, many people came to visit the construction site, and the number of construction personnel was small and frequently transferred. In response to this situation, the Party organization especially strengthened the security and safety work on the construction site. The Party organization put forward the slogans "Raise vigilance, protect the fruits of labor" and "Resolutely implement expert suggestions, conscientiously implement various procedures, and ensure safe operation" to the workers. Strengthen the education of security and safety personnel, improve their political awareness and sense of responsibility, and mobilize the masses to protect the fruits of labor. The administrative side also established and improved various security and safety responsibility systems to ensure that everything is someone's responsibility and everywhere is someone's responsibility to ensure the safety of the project.

    无缝钢管厂竣工期间的政治工作
    贺穋章、刘汉池、李品杰
    无缝钢管厂工程，由于中共鞍山钢铁公司轧钢工程公司委员会加强了竣工期间的政治工作，所以使移交、验收等工作得以顺利进行。
    无缝钢管厂工程是由六个专业工程公司联合施工的。过去，各个施工单位是根据工序先后、工程区域分别施工的，到了竣工时期，施工就由分散到集中，要把整个工程中的各个部件集中成一个整体。这就需要各个工种紧密配合，任何一个工种配合不上，或一部分工程发生了问题，都会影响全部试车工作。结尾工程的复杂性还表现在工程项目多、工程数量少，技术要求十分严格，在通电试车中又容易发生人身或设备事故。竣工期间的另一个特点是工地上单位增多，人员减少。但是各方面来参观的人员却增多，厂内人来人往，管理比较困难。
    职工的思想情绪也与大量施工阶段不同，一般的都认识到了提前完成无缝钢管厂工程的意义，积极努力争取提前竣工；但也有不少职工存在着这样两种思想：一种是缺乏对工程负责到底的思想，以采取“推出去”“过关”的态度来对待移交验收工作，甚至说验收工作不好，生产部门故意“挑毛病”、“找岔子”。基本建设部门的职工则“舍不得”将修好的工厂交出去，个别的还要求留下当生产工人。而工地的政治工作情况却又不适应上述客观情况的需要。承包工程的六个专业公司中，轧钢工程公司负责总包，其他都是分包单位。今年四月，轧钢工程公司的主要力量转向其他工程后，工地上一直没有一个统一的政治工作机构，几个单位各干各的、工地上四个广播站同时播音，四种声音交织在一起，一个也听不清。在宣传内容上因为缺乏统一领导也常常发生问题。
    根据这些情况，轧钢工程公司抽调干部加强了工地政治工作力量，在中共鞍山市委领导下，又召开了和无缝钢管厂有关各单位的政治工作会议。在这个会议上统一了思想统一了领导，组织了无缝钢管厂工地政治工作组，统一领导竣工时期的政治工作。同时确定了竣工时期政治工作的总口号：开展增产节约竣工竞赛，保证工程质量，争取提前竣工，迎接国庆节，给毛主席献礼。接着便大张旗鼓地展开了政治思想教育工作。
    政治工作组首先对群众进行了提前竣工的意义的教育，通过这一教育，使全体职工认识到提前竣工是大家对国家的最大的贡献，是最大的增产节约，对国内、国外都会发生巨大的政治与经济影响。宣传工作人员们还给大家具体地计算了，如果无缝钢管厂工程能提前一天、十天、一个月投入生产，就能给国家创造多少财富；这些财富能买多少机器，能修多大的工厂，能买多少飞机、多少拖拉机、多少粮食；宣传工作人员还给大家讲解了提前制出无缝钢管，对工业、农业、运输业的发展的推动作用。这样使全体职工具体地认识了提前竣工对国家工业化和国防建设的意义。接着，又发动了职工讨论竣工计划，开展增产节约竣工竞赛。工地上班组之间甚至人与人之间都开展了挑战应战、全体职工都写了保证书，这对保证完成工程任务起了很大的作用。
    在贯彻责任制过程中，通过先进人物和先进思想，树立对工程质量负责到底的思想。政治工作人员们，宣传苏联专家对质量负责的模范行动、推广工段主任李仁、技术员张秘凡对工程质量大胆负责并负责到底的先进思想和先进事迹，同时对照批判了“怕负责任”、“推出去了事”的思想。这样做的结果，加强了劳动纪律和职工的责任心，给执行试车验收中的各种规程打下了基础。
    政治工作组还在职工中进行了基本建设意义的教育，克服了“舍不得”交出去的思想，鼓励大家搞好竣工验收工作。
    在解决上述问题时，政治工作组进行了以下几种工作：一、组织慰问联欢，进行形象化的宣传。组织慰问联欢的目的是为了鼓舞职工的工作热情，同时，搞好基本建设与生产单位职工间的关系。政治工作组在竣工期间曾先后邀请鞍山市或公司的文工团、文化馆、学生做了三次慰问演出。这三次慰问对职工的鼓舞很大，特别是少先队员们的慰问信和献花，使大家非常感动。管道公司老工人孙玉祥说：“孩子们管咱们一口一个叔叔大爷的叫着，不好好干，可真不对劲。”于是孙玉祥要求领导上分配他去完成困难的任务。政治工作组还有计划地组织了四次基本建设与生产单位职工的慰问联欢，并发动他们互相写信，互相鼓励。生产单位职工写信给基本建设职工表示感谢和敬意；基本建设职工写信给生产单位职工欢迎他们早日验收工程，以便早日为国家生产财富。经过这些工作，逐渐纠正了职工中的各种错误看法，使大家认识到无缝钢管厂的建成是集体劳动的结果，加强了基本建设和生产单位职工的团结。
    在竣工期间政治工作组针对工程的需要和职工思想中的问题，广泛地利用了黑板报、大字报、标语等宣传工具，并且以提前竣工的政治经济意义、无缝钢管的用处为内容，制造了三十四幅连环画，排在人行道的两边，这种形象化的宣传最容易深入人心。工人王福山看了连环画以后，算了算细账，说：“咱们工程提前一天竣工的好处真不知道有多大，……干起活来可得抓紧时间”。
    二、充分发挥党的报告员、宣传员、党员、团员的作用。党的报告员根据竣工期间的实际情况向职工做过三次报告。政治工作组曾数次召开党员、团员、宣传员及积极分子会议，布置宣传内容和宣传方法，使他们能够及时地在职工中进行宣传鼓动。如机器安装技术员温福田，在试车运转中，违犯了操作规程，造成了事故。宣传员修宪有等便抓住这件事对职工进行了宣传教育。宣传员发现有些工人急着到别处去工作和个别工人不太注意质量的情况，就向职工提出了“不好不走，不（交）清不走”、“做的好、交的清，保证不返工”的口号。对于稳定工人情绪和保证质量起了一定的作用。
    三、发动职工开展质量复查运动。在增产节约竣工竞赛、继续贯彻责任制，特别是技术负责制和基层责任制度时，工地上曾经进行了质量复查。当时，一方面组织了质量复查委员会、复查小组，进行复查；一方面发动职工展开了质量复查运动。各施工单位的工人都召开小组会、每个职工回忆自己或别人作的工程的质量情况，回忆发生过问题的地方和自己没有足够把握的地方，都提出来，然后进行检查。这个工作开始进行时并不是很顺利的，虽然已经向职工进行了质量教育，但仍有个别工人以敷衍的态度对待质量问题。工人滕云文说：“有个一星半点的小毛病，检查员也看不见，给他一锤就行了呗！”有的人怕检查出了问题“丢人”，不肯积极进行检查；还有的嫌麻烦，认为“别人检查出来算、检查不出来就拉倒”。还有不少非党工人等着“看党员的”，党员检查就检查，否则就拉倒。因此，党组织一方面针对职工思想情况，及时展开了宣传鼓动，同时号召党员、团员带头进行检查，使群众的质量复查工作得以顺利进行。职工发动起来以后，共检查出七五九个质量问题，其中有些是相当严重的。工人齐开忠、齐文发现了三处油管内有木塞，如果不是及时发现，油就送不到机器上去，机械寿命就要受到影响。像这样的问题，只是检查验收人员去检查就很不容易发现。
    四、进行技术宣传。竣工期间技术复杂，要求严密，只靠全体职工的积极性（这当然是很必要的）还不能够完全解决问题，必须教育工人掌握技术。根据这个需要，政治工作组曾经组织党员、宣传员、技术人员、老技工等，大力展开了技术宣传。技术宣传的方式很多，主要的有：（一）利用工作前的十分钟进行技术讲话。讲话的内容是介绍前一天试车的质量和技术保安情况，表扬好的，批评坏的，并说明坏的原因，使职工经常注意提高质量保证安全。这个方法现在已经成了一种制度。（二）进行技术交底。在试运转之前，分别向工人讲解机器性能，使工人在试运转时心里有数，以免发生事故。工人说：“这样做真好，若不知机器的底细，谁知是该给他下多大的‘药剂’”。（三）组织职工学习苏联专家建议和各种试车规程。有时苏联专家提出了建议，但职工们受技术水平的限制，常常不知道该怎样执行。在试运转前按工种和机器的性能制订了很多试运规程，技术低的工人也同样不懂。政治工作组便和有关单位一起举办座谈会、报告会等，组织工人分别工种进行学习。这样不仅适应了施工需要，而且提高了职工的技术水平。
    竣工期间来工地参观的人很多，施工人员少而且调动频繁。根据这个情况，党组织特别加强了工地的保卫和保安工作。党组织向职工群众提出了“提高警惕，保护劳动成果”，“坚决贯彻专家建议，认真执行各种规程，保证安全运转”的口号。加强对保卫和保安人员的教育，提高他们的政治觉悟和责任感，并发动群众保护劳动成果。行政方面也建立和健全了各种保卫和保安的责任制度，做到事事有人负责处处有人负责，以保证工程的安全。
