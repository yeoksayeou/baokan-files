Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 14th: Kim Yong-shik, a North Korean People's Army prisoner of war repatriated today from Camp 34, revealed to Neutral Nations personnel in Panmunjom: A few days ago, a North Korean prisoner of war was beaten to death by special agents after attempting to escape the barbed wire fence and request to go home. This new bloodbath once again demonstrates that the US side's special agents disregard the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and use murder to prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war, reaching a point of extreme recklessness.

Kim Yong-shik said, "On the morning of the 10th of this month at four o'clock, Kim Chang-bok and I escaped together. He was slower, and in front of the second barbed wire fence, he was caught up by special agents who beat him with stones and wooden sticks. The special agents also stabbed him several times in the back with knives. He was seriously injured and died from excessive blood loss." To date, thirteen of our captured personnel have been found to have been murdered by Li Jiang's special agents in the East Camp in order to prevent prisoners of war from requesting repatriation. However, some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission oppose taking effective measures against the terrorist rulers and murderers in the POW camps under the pretext of so-called "humanitarianism."

Kim Bok-seon and Li Jong-in, who returned with Kim Yong-shik, unanimously revealed that Li Fei's special agents in the G area were preparing to send "suspicious elements" to the camps that had already listened to explanations in order to deprive the prisoners of war of the opportunity to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation. After the North Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 48 listened to the explanations, Wen Chong-ho, the head of Li Fei's special agent in the G area, convened a meeting of the "battalion commanders" of the eight camps under his jurisdiction. At the meeting, Wen Chong-ho instructed the battalions to investigate "ideologically wavering elements" and send them to Camp 48. Kim Bok-seon, who was originally in Camp 49, said, "I heard special agents reveal that they had already decided on a batch of people to be sent away. I was afraid that I would be sent away and never get the opportunity to listen to the explanations, so I risked my life to escape and apply for repatriation."

Kim Bok-seon and Li Jong-in, who returned from Camp 51, both said that as the explanation work continued to be stalled, the special agents' terrorist rule over the prisoners of war was intensifying. Every night, special agents tortured those who wanted to be repatriated, forcing them to confess the other people who wanted to be repatriated, then tattooed them, and forced them to write blood letters refusing repatriation. The battalion commander of Camp 51 personally threatened Li Jong-in and four other prisoners of war, saying, "If you don't give up repatriation, we will kill you!" Last Saturday, the special agents received instructions from Seoul on the radio. Li Jong-in was afraid that there would be new terrorist actions, so he escaped overnight. Kim Bok-seon said that in order to prevent prisoners of war from escaping, the special agents in Camp 49 cut open several places in the inner barbed wire fence. If they found someone climbing out of the barbed wire fence, the special agents could immediately chase out from these gaps and arrest him. Therefore, Kim Bok-seon dared not climb the barbed wire fence, but pretended to go to see a doctor and requested repatriation from the Indian troops.

The return of these three people to Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. today increased the number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who risked their lives to escape from the camps and request repatriation to 184. This completely exposed the lie fabricated by the US side that prisoners of war "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated."

### 我归来人员揭露特务残杀战俘的新血案

    我归来人员揭露特务残杀战俘的新血案
   【新华社开城十四日电】今天自三十四号营场遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金容植在板门店向中立国人员揭露：几天以前，一个朝鲜籍战俘在企图逃出铁丝网要求回家时被追上去的特务打死了。这个新的血案再次表明：美方特务蔑视中立国遣返委员会，用凶杀来阻止战俘遣返，已经到了极端猖狂的地步。
    金容植说：“本月十日早上四点钟，我和金昌福一同逃跑，他的动作慢了些，在第二道铁丝网前，被特务追上用石头、木棒乱打，特务又用刀子在他背上戳了几个窟窿，他负了重伤，流血过多死去。”到现在为止，东场里营场内李蒋特务为了阻止战俘要求遣返用各种方法杀害的我方被俘人员已经获悉的就有十三个人。而中立国遣返委员会某些委员却以所谓“人道”的理由来反对对战俘营中的恐怖统治者、杀人犯采取有效的措施。
    与金容植一起归来的金福善和李钟仁一致揭露：G营区李匪特务准备把“可疑分子”送到已经听过解释的营场以剥夺战俘听解释和申请遣返的机会。在第四十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员听过解释以后，G营区的李匪特务头子文重浩曾召集所属八个营场的“大队长”开会，文重浩在会上指示各大队去调查“思想动摇分子”，把他们送到第四十八号营场。原在第四十九号营场的金福善说：“我曾听到特务分子透露，他们已经决定了一批要送去的人。我就是因害怕自己被送走，永远得不到听解释的机会，才冒着生命危险逃出来申请遣返的。”
    金福善和自第五十一号营场归来的李钟仁都说，在解释工作继续陷于停顿的时候，特务对战俘的恐怖统治已日益加强。每夜，特务分子用酷刑拷打想遣返的人，逼他们供出其他想遣返的人，再给他们刺字，强迫他们写血书拒绝遣返。第五十一号营场的大队长曾亲自恫吓过李钟仁和另四个被俘人员说：“如果不放弃遣返，就杀死你们！”上星期六，特务用收音机收到了汉城的指示，李钟仁怕又有新的恐怖行动，便连夜逃了出来。金福善说，四十九号营场的特务分子为了防止战俘逃出来，便剪开几处里面的铁丝网，如发觉有人翻出铁丝网，特务们就可以立刻从这些缺口追出去把他抓回来。因此金福善不敢爬铁丝网出来，而是假称出来看病向印度部队要求遣返的。
    今天上午十一时回到板门店的这三位归来人员，使冒着生命危险逃出营场要求遣返的朝中战俘的人数增加到一百八十四人。这完全揭穿了美方制造的战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”的谎言。
