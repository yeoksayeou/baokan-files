    Shaanxi Province Establishes Opera Revision and Examination Committee

    In order to implement Chairman Mao's opera policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom; weed through the old to bring forth the new," and the Ministry of Culture's instructions on revising and examining repertoires, the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau recently established an Opera Revision and Examination Committee. The purpose is to collect, examine, and revise popular operas in the province, so that the processed repertoires can be popularized and promoted, closely coordinate with national construction, and enrich the people's spiritual life. The Opera Revision and Examination Committee plans to begin revising the scripts of operas such as "Fa Men Temple," "The Broken Axe," "Jasper Hairpin," "Beating Reed Catkins," "Du Shiniang," "Fiery Steed," "The Locust Tree," and "Yu Tang Chun," and "The Romance in the Cabinet" this year.

    陕西省成立戏曲修审委员会
    陕西省文化事业管理局为了贯彻毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲方针，和中央文化部关于修改审定剧目的指示精神，最近成立了戏曲修审委员会，以便对全省的流行戏曲进行搜集、审定和修改，使加工后的剧目流行推广，并密切配合国家建设，丰富人民的精神生活。戏曲修审委员会计划在今年年内着手修改“法门寺”、“折桂斧”、“碧玉钗”、“鞭打芦花”、“杜十娘”、“火炎驹”、“槐荫树”、“玉堂春”、“柜中缘”等剧本。
