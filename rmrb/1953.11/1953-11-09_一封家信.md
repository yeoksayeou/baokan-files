    A Letter From Home
    Zhou Liangjun
    I've been in the People's Liberation Army for several years and haven't been home, and I miss my family terribly. Last month, I wrote a letter home asking for a photo, but I haven't received a reply yet, which is making me really anxious!
    Just as I was getting anxious, the letter arrived. The clerk handed me the letter and said, "There's also a photo inside." Ah! It really arrived! I opened it and saw a six-inch photo. On the back, there were three large characters: "Family Reunion." This made me extremely happy. The deputy squad leader shouted, and all the comrades gathered around.
    The photo was taken very well! Dad and Mom were sitting down, their kind smiles showing beneath their graying hair. Standing next to Dad was my little sister, wearing a red scarf, and she's grown so much taller. Standing behind Mom was a young woman, quite sturdy and pretty. Who is this? I couldn't recognize her at all. And the chubby baby sitting on the ground, with a small face smiling like a flower, one chubby little hand raised high, as if waving to me. Who is this again? It really confused me.
    The comrades pointed at the photo and asked me, but I couldn't answer. Everyone started guessing wildly. Some said, "That woman must be your sister-in-law, and the chubby baby is your little nephew!" I thought, that's quite possible! Our deputy squad leader said, "Why guess? I'll read the letter to you, and the problem will be solved."
    The letter was written by my sister, and the small characters were very elegant.
      "Dear Second Brother: You see that Big Brother isn't in the photo, right? That's because he's away in the county studying. It's quite inconvenient for us here, as we're far from the county seat, and it's over a hundred li round trip. The district bought a car, but no one knows how to drive it. The district chief said that Big Brother has some education and is a model village cadre, so he sent him to learn. He'll graduate in two months and come back as a car driver. In the future, he'll transport the products from our cooperative to the county to exchange for machines. The district chief says this is called 'urban-rural exchange'..." The deputy squad leader, being a bit of a chatterbox, interrupted here, saying, "Hey, it's not just us building a modern national defense force, even the squad leader's family is moving towards mechanization!" Everyone was engrossed in listening and couldn't bear it, urging, "Stop chattering and read on quickly!"
    The deputy squad leader continued reading: "...In the future, we'll ride in the car driven by Big Brother to visit you!" This sentence made everyone laugh. The deputy squad leader said, "Hey, this little imp is thinking so beautifully! Squad leader, when they come to see you in a car, you'll have to strike a national defense army pose to greet them!" I immediately struck an at-attention, rifle-present pose for everyone to see, and everyone held back their laughter, saying, "Good, the squad leader's posture is very standard!"
    After reading for so long, my questions still hadn't been answered. Then I heard the deputy squad leader read, "There are two people in the photo you haven't met before, so you don't recognize them, right? That's your sister-in-law and your two-year-old nephew..." I happily said, "You guessed correctly!"
    The deputy squad leader continued to read:
    "Sister-in-law is the women's group leader and is currently studying literacy. She says that when our village's cooperative is transformed into a collective farm, she wants to be a tractor driver..." The deputy squad leader chimed in again: "Hey, your brother is becoming a driver, and she wants to be a tractor driver, they're really competing side-by-side!—Don't worry, I'll keep reading." Afraid that everyone would say he was being a chatterbox again, he quickly continued reading:
    "Second Brother, you're protecting the motherland, Big Brother is driving a car, Sister-in-law is driving a tractor, Dad is managing the household affairs, and I'm studying... Look, our family has soldiers, workers, farmers, and students, it's really like a small country."
      "It really is a small country!" The deputy squad leader said with a grin after finishing reading.
    It'll be so wonderful to go home in the future! At that time, I'll ride in the car driven by my brother, and watch my sister-in-law driving a tractor in the fields... Thinking about these things, I felt extremely happy in my heart, and I picked up my pen to write a letter congratulating my family on their happy life.

    一封家信
    周良钧
    我参加解放军好几年没回家，怪想得慌，上月写了封家信去要照片，到现在还没有回信，真使人着急！
    正急着，信就来啦。文书同志把信交给我说：“里面还有照片呢。”啊！真寄来啦！我打开一看，是一张六寸的照片。背面还写着三个大字：“合家欢”。这可把我乐坏了。副班长一嚷嚷，同志们都围上来了。
    照片照得真好呀！爸和妈坐着，花白的头发下面，露着慈祥的笑脸。爸爸旁边站着小妹妹，小妹妹系着红领巾，长得高多了。妈身后站着个年轻妇女，挺壮实，挺漂亮。这是谁呢？我怎么也认不出来。还有地下坐的那个胖娃娃，小脸蛋笑得像朵鲜花，一只肥胖的小手高高扬着，好像跟我打招呼。这又是谁呢？真把我闹矇了。
    同志们指着照片问我，我也答不上。大家就乱猜起来，有的说：“那女的准是你嫂子，胖娃娃是你小侄！”我一想，真有可能性哩！我们副班长说：“瞎猜啥，我给你念念信，问题就解决啦。”
    信是妹妹写的，小字写的真秀气。
      “二哥：你看照片上没有大哥，挺奇怪吧？大哥不在家，到县里学习去了。咱们这儿离县城远，来去一趟百多里，怪不方便的。区里买了辆汽车，没有人会开，区长说咱大哥有点文化，又是模范村干部，就派他去学，还有两个月就毕业啦，回来就是个汽车司机啦。将来把咱们合作社生产的东西，都拉到县里去换机器回来。区长说这叫‘城乡交流’……”副班长有个囉嗦劲儿，念到这里他插言说：“嘿，别说咱们建设现代化的国防军，连班长家里都向机械化迈进了呢！”大家听入了神，哪能耐得住，催着说：“别囉嗦啦，快念吧！”
    副班长接着念：“……将来我们就坐大哥开的汽车去看你！”这一句把大伙都逗笑了。副班长说：“嘿，这小鬼想的真美呀！班长，人家坐着汽车来看你，你也得摆个国防军样子去接人家呀！”我当时就作了个立正持枪的样子给大家看，大家都憋住笑说：“好，班长的姿势真标准！”
    念了半天，我的疑问还没解开。只听副班长念道：“照片上有两个人你没见过面，不认识吧？那是咱大嫂和两岁的小侄……”我高兴地说：“你们猜的真正确！”
    副班长又念下去：
    “大嫂是妇女小组长，现在正学习文化。她说等咱村的合作社改成集体农庄的时候，她要当拖拉机手去……”副班长又开腔了：“嘿，你哥哥当司机，她就要当拖拉机手，真是并着膀比赛！——你们别着急，我就念。”他怕大伙又说他囉嗦，赶快接着念下去：
    “二哥，你保卫祖国，大哥开汽车，嫂嫂开拖拉机，爸爸管理家务，我读书……你看咱家有战士，有工人，有农民，还有学生，真像个小国家呢。”
      “真是个小国家！”副班长念完了，笑嘻嘻说。
    将来回家看看多美呀！那时候，我要坐哥哥开的汽车，要看嫂嫂开着拖拉机在地里跑……想着这些，我的心里高兴极了，就提笔写了一封祝贺家中幸福生活的信。
