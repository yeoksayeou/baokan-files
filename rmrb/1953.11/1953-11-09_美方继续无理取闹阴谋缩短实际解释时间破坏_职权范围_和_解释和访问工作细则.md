Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The U.S. side is intensifying its efforts to undermine the explanation work. Today, the explanation work for the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers was again unable to proceed due to the obstruction of Kuomintang secret agents.

    People remember that during the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. side repeatedly claimed that all so-called "anti-communist" prisoners of war in its hands resolutely refused repatriation. The U.S. side has always said that all prisoners of war "voluntarily" and "would rather die than return to their country." However, despite the fact that many prisoners of war dare not express their willingness to return to their country due to the long-term and ongoing terrorist rule by the U.S. side, the ironclad fact that more than two hundred prisoners of war have risked their lives to request repatriation has exposed the U.S. side's preposterous lie that prisoners of war "would rather die than return to their country," and has completely exposed the U.S. side's monstrous crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The liars in Washington have suffered their greatest defeat.

    It is precisely for this reason that the U.S. side is doing everything possible to undermine the explanation work. Many of the initial sabotage activities will not be mentioned. Recently, the U.S. side has further shed its mask. Many of the U.S. "representatives" and "interpreters" in the explanation tents are filled with special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang bandit gangs, and they have used the most shameless tricks in recent days to undermine the explanation work. When prisoners of war listened to the explanations on the 4th and 5th, those U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek agents who acted as so-called "detaining party representatives," "observing representatives," and "translators" used various shameless methods of violating the rules and disrupting the explanation field to increase the prisoners of war's fear and threaten them not to request repatriation. Many prisoners of war sat in the explanation tents for several hours, their tearful eyes looking at the door to apply for repatriation, sweating profusely, and mentally disturbed. They wanted to request repatriation; however, the various interference activities of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek agents sitting in the tents, as well as the U.S. personnel deliberately walking back and forth outside the door to apply for repatriation, threatened them, making them afraid of whether they could truly be repatriated without losing their lives in vain. The North Korean and Chinese captured personnel who have already requested repatriation have unanimously described their painful state of mind at that time.

    Anyone with a little conscience, anyone with a little humanitarian spirit, seeing this situation, cannot help but sympathize with the tragic experiences of the prisoners of war, and cannot help but hope that the North Korean and Chinese side can give the prisoners of war a full explanation, break their concerns, and enable them to realize their desire to request repatriation. The so-called "representatives" of the U.S. side are certainly not such people. Their only task is to undermine the explanation work, so that the prisoners of war will forever become the victims of the United States' cold or hot war. Those who have blood on their hands on Geoje Island are now posing as thorough humanitarians, calling the explanation work "cruel," "inhuman," and "mental abuse"... Even a so-called "observing representative" of the U.S. side, Messelin, could shamelessly say that watching the North Korean and Chinese side explain to the prisoners of war was "like watching a person being killed in front of your eyes, without being able to think of a way to save him." They even regarded our calling the prisoners of war "comrades" as a threat. Thus, according to the U.S. side's position, persuading prisoners of war to go home and calling prisoners of war "comrades" is a "threat," while detaining prisoners of war forever to be cannon fodder for the United States, disemboweling them, squeezing them to death, and trampling them to death is "humanitarian"! Therefore, when they slaughter prisoners of war or see prisoners of war being disemboweled, they not only do not see a person being killed in front of their eyes, but also shout cheers loudly. But when they see people patiently persuading prisoners of war to go home and affectionately calling them comrades, they are so sad that they want to die. This is a vivid portrayal of the moral standards and living standards of the U.S. imperialist murderers.

    This attitude of the U.S. side is not surprising. What is surprising is that the Swiss representatives actually protested against the North Korean and Chinese side for patiently explaining to the prisoners of war, using the excuse that the explanation time was "too long" to withdraw from the explanation tent, interrupting the explanation work, and threatening to disband the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it impossible to implement the "Terms of Reference." These people never mentioned the Geneva Convention when the U.S. side's special agents disemboweled the prisoners of war, and never made a word of condemnation or criticism of the special agents, but they hated the North Korean and Chinese side for persuading the prisoners of war to go home so deeply. It seems that sitting down to listen to the explanation for a few hours is much longer than the two or three years of the special agents' terrorist life in the prisoner of war camp, and it seems that the special agents' torture and disembowelment are more in line with the Geneva Convention than persuading the prisoners of war to go home! Is this fair?

    Now, the U.S. propaganda machine is desperately spreading lies, as if it is the North Korean and Chinese side that is delaying the explanation time. The fact is that the North Korean and Chinese side is trying its best to allow the prisoners of war to have sufficient time to consider exercising their right to repatriation, while the U.S. side is trying its best to restrict and deprive them of this time, and is attempting to use this excuse to create incidents and undermine the explanation. The Associated Press reporter said in a report on the 22nd camp today that the special agents refused to come out to listen to the explanation, saying that letting the prisoners of war come out to listen to the explanation again would "double the risk" of prisoners of war requesting repatriation. Today, the head of the special agents in the camp has openly asked the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, General Thimayya, to shorten the explanation time.

    It is very clear that the U.S. side and the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents' joint request to shorten the explanation time is another crazy attack on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access." Article 8 of the "Detailed Rules" stipulates: "Within the time limit stipulated in Article 8 of the Terms of Reference of this Committee, several explanations and visits may be conducted to the same group of prisoners of war or the same prisoner of war." And Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and Article 22 of the "Detailed Rules" stipulate that the prisoners of war shall be explained for 90 days, and the explanation can be carried out for 8 hours a day. Therefore, the explanation of prisoners of war within eight hours is not subject to any time limit. The purpose of the U.S. side's current request to limit the explanation time is to make the explanation work completely ineffective, so as to achieve its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

### 美方继续无理取闹阴谋缩短实际解释时间破坏“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”

    美方继续无理取闹阴谋缩短实际解释时间
    破坏“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”
   【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方正变本加厉地破坏解释工作。今天，对中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行的解释工作，又因为国民党特务分子的阻挠而无法进行。
    人们记得，在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，美方一直扬言在它手里的所有所谓“反共”战俘都是坚决拒绝遣返的。美方一直说所有战俘“自愿”“宁死也不愿回国”。可是，尽管有许多战俘由于美方长期和正在进行的特务恐怖统治而不敢表示回国意愿，但已有二百多名战俘冒着性命危险要求遣返归来的这一铁的事实，已揭露了美方所谓战俘“宁死也不愿回国”的弥天大谎，也完全暴露了美方强迫扣留战俘的滔天罪行。华盛顿的说谎者们遭到了最大的失败。
    正是因为这个缘故，美方竭尽全力来破坏解释工作。开始的许多破坏活动不说了。最近，美方进一步剥下自己的假面具。在解释帐篷的许多美方
  “代表”、“译员”都由李承晚和国民党匪帮的特务充任，他们这几天来施用了最无耻的伎俩，破坏解释工作。四、五两日战俘听取解释时，那些充当所谓“拘留一方代表”、“观察代表”、“翻译”的美、蒋特务，用破坏规则，扰乱解释场的种种无耻办法来增加战俘的疑惧心理，威胁战俘不得要求遣返。许多战俘几个钟头地坐在解释帐篷里，含泪的眼睛望着申请遣返的门，满头大汗，心神不安，他们想要求遣返；可是坐在帐篷里的美、蒋特务的各种干涉活动，以及故意在申请遣返的门外走来走去的美方人员，却威胁着他们，使他们害怕是不是能够真正被遣返而不致枉送性命。已要求遣返归来的朝中被俘人员都一致述诉了当时痛苦的心境。
    任何稍有良心的人，任何稍有人道主义精神的人，看了这种情形，都不能不同情战俘们的悲惨遭遇，都不能不希望朝中方面能对战俘进行充分的解释，打破他们的顾虑，使他们实现要求遣返的心愿。美方的所谓“代表”当然不是这样的人。他们的唯一任务就是破坏解释工作，使战俘永远成为美国进行冷战或热战的牺牲品。这些在巨济岛双手染满鲜血的人，现在都装作是十足的人道主义者，竟把解释工作叫作“残酷的”、“不人道的”、“精神虐待”……。甚至，美方的一名所谓“观察代表”梅塞林竟能这样无耻地说，看着朝中方面对战俘进行解释，“有如看着一个人在你的眼前被杀害，而毫不能想办法来救他一样。”他们甚至把我方称战俘是“同志”说成是威胁。这样，按照美方的立场，劝战俘回家，称战俘做“同志”就是“威胁”，把战俘永远扣留下来替美国当炮灰，把他们剖腹挖心，夹死、踩死，就是“人道”！因此，当他们屠杀战俘或看见战俘被剖腹挖心时，他们不但没有看见一个人在他们眼前被杀害，而且还要高声喝采。但是，当他们看见人耐心地劝战俘回家，爱护地称战俘为同志时，他们就难过得要死。这正是美帝国主义杀人犯们的道德标准和生活标准的活生生的写照。
    美方的这种态度是不足为奇的。奇怪的倒是瑞士代表却居然也抗议朝中方面对战俘进行耐心的解释，藉口解释时间“太长”而退出解释帐篷，使解释工作中断，并且威胁要拆散中立国遣返委员会，使“职权范围”无法实施。这些人在美方特务将战俘剖腹挖心的时候，从来不提日内瓦公约，对特务从无一句谴责或批评，可是却这样深恨朝中方面劝战俘回家。似乎坐下来听取解释的几个钟头，要比战俘营的特务恐怖生活的两三个年头要长得多，似乎特务的拷打、挖心要比劝战俘回家更合乎日内瓦公约！这难道是公正的吗？
    现在，美国的宣传机器正在拚命散布谎言，似乎是朝中方面在拖延解释时间。事实是朝中方面尽量让战俘有考虑行使其遣返权利的充分时间，而美方则尽量限制、剥夺这个时间，并企图拿这种藉口来制造事件，破坏解释。合众社记者在报道今天二十二号营场特务们拒绝出来听取解释时就说，让战俘再次出来听取解释，会使战俘要求遣返的“危险增加一倍”。今天营场中的特务头子已公开向中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅要求缩短解释时间了。
    十分明显，美方和李、蒋特务一起要求缩短解释时间，是对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的又一次疯狂进攻。“工作细则”第八款规定：“在本委员会职权范围第八款规定的时限内，得对同一组战俘或同一个战俘进行若干次解释和访问。”而“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款和“工作细则”第二十二款规定，对战俘得进行九十天的解释，每天可以解释八小时。因此，在八小时之内对战俘的解释是不受任何时间限制的。美方现在要求限制解释时间其目的是使解释工作根本失去作用，以遂其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
