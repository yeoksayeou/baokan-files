　　Model Mutual Aid Teams are also Model Grain Selling Teams
　　The Liu Tianbao Mutual Aid Team in Guofu Township, Third District, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, was named a first-class model mutual aid team in the county last year due to its good production. This autumn, after the state began purchasing grain, the mutual aid team, with the help of local cadres, discussed the significance of selling grain to the state. The team members calculated the accounts of the loans the state had provided this year: the state bank lent the team over two million yuan in agricultural loans and loans for draught cattle and fertilizers; the team used these loans to purchase two draught cattle, three sets of harrows, and thirty-seven other farm tools, and repaired five plows. This played a significant role in this year's production. The team members realized from these facts that the government always thinks of the people and that industry greatly helps agricultural production. The team members also recalled that when the area was short of grain this summer, the government transported rice from Guizhou to supply it, so the farmers did not suffer losses from unscrupulous merchants. Many team members said: "We sell grain to the state, and the state has enough grain to ensure that there is no shortage of grain and to ensure price stability." The team members actively sold their surplus grain to the state, with the entire team selling a total of 5,000 jin.
　　Driven by the Liu Tianbao Mutual Aid Team, the farmers of Guofu Township sold more than 18,000 jin of surplus grain to the state in a few days. Therefore, the Liu Tianbao Mutual Aid Team received the "Model Grain Selling Team" red flag. (Chen Minglie)
　　Actively Responding to the State's Call
　　Deng Wanrong, a farmer from Xinshanwan Village, Fifth District, Lishi County, Shanxi Province, actively responded to the call to sell surplus grain to the state, voluntarily eating more coarse grains and less fine grains, and sold two shi of wheat to the state.
　　Why did he respond so actively to the call to sell surplus grain to the state? Deng Wanrong's own answer is: "Listening to the Communist Party and the People's Government is never wrong. We have benefited too much from listening to the Communist Party and the People's Government in the past. In 1950, we responded to the call of the Party and the government and joined the mutual aid team, production improved, and living conditions improved. But at that time, we did not have the strength to buy cattle or sheep. That year, the government also called for the establishment of credit cooperatives, and we also joined. Our mutual aid team borrowed money from the credit cooperative to buy thirty sheep. Now the sheep loans have been repaid, and the sheep have multiplied to 290, worth 160 shi of millet. Isn't this all the benefit of believing in the Communist Party and the People's Government! Now the Party and the government are calling on us to sell surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction. Just look at how industry helps us. In recent years, the workers have manufactured many walking plows, pesticides, fertilizers, and bean cakes for us, which has enabled our agriculture to achieve bumper harvests. For example, this year, my two mu of oat land was plowed once with a new plow and sown with seed mixed with Ceresan. As a result, I harvested one shi and six dou of oats, doubling the yield compared to last year. In the past, industrial products such as cloth, oil, salt, and matches were terribly expensive. Buying a pack of matches would cost eight sheng of millet. Now industrial products are cheap. Buying a pack of matches only costs eight he of millet. Isn't this all thanks to the development of industry! Now we actively sell surplus grain to the state, and if industry develops, our production will be further improved, and our lives will be further improved."
                  (Liu Tingyu, Zhang Guoliang, Zhang Ximing)
　　Launched a Patriotic Grain Selling Upsurge
　　The peasant masses in Sangpan Township, Xiatang District, Lushan County, Henan Province, led by Party members and mutual aid teams, launched a patriotic grain selling upsurge.
　　At the end of October, the Sangpan Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of all Party members, explaining the significance of selling surplus grain to the state for national construction. At the meeting, Party members actively volunteered to sell grain, with nine Party members volunteering to sell 1,562 jin of surplus grain. After the meeting, the Sangpan Township Branch first led the Zhang Xianwu and Zhang Huaizhen mutual aid teams in discussions. Through summarizing production achievements and recalling and comparing prices before and after liberation, the members of these two mutual aid teams all realized the benefits of industrial development for farmers' production and life. For example, Zhang Yitian said: "This autumn, my 1.8 mu of densely planted millet yielded a bumper harvest, with 2,115 jin harvested. This is because 35 jin of fertilizer were applied in stages, and 666 powder was used to kill pests. If the workers hadn't produced fertilizer and pesticides, we farmers would never have thought of a good solution." When they talked about how salt prices had become cheaper after liberation, everyone said with emotion: "In the past, eating salt in our mountains was like eating gold. Now every household can buy sea salt at a very cheap price. From this, we can also see the benefits of industrial development." After discussion, eighteen farmers in these two mutual aid teams sold more than 3,400 jin of surplus grain to the state. On November 2nd, the township held a mass meeting to introduce the model behavior of these two mutual aid teams and Sun Rongqing's patriotic grain selling. 108 farmers in the township all expressed their willingness to sell surplus grain to the state. On November 4th, Sangpan Township organized collective grain sales. The Xiatang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 9,100 jin of grain that day. Currently, this patriotic grain selling upsurge is being widely carried out throughout the district. (Cui Zhiyuan, Liu Dong'an)
　　Selling Grain to Prepare for Next Year's Big Production
　　Nianfeng Township, Second District, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, has generally achieved a bumper harvest this year, with almost "every family having surplus grain and every household having grain to sell." Many farmers are actively selling their surplus grain to the state to expand production and strive for an even greater harvest next year. Elderly farmer Liao Ruisheng sold 900 jin of rice to the state; after selling the grain, he bought 1,300 jin of lime and added a large manure cellar that can hold more than 300 dan of manure. He said: "I have lived for almost seventy years, and in the past, I always saw low prices when new grain was on the market and high prices when there was a shortage of grain. I have never seen such a stable world of prices as after liberation. So I want to quickly sell my surplus grain and invest it in production." Farmer Yao Meizhao sold more than 800 jin of surplus grain to the state, added farm tools, and built two new pig pens. The Yang Bogui Mutual Aid Team replaced a small buffalo with a large buffalo after selling grain. Farmers throughout the township have a high level of enthusiasm for production. In the past, farmers here did not pay much attention to planting fertilizer crops, saying: "Plant the grass seeds and don't worry about it. It will grow next spring." Now, everywhere in this township, you can hear people saying: "If you want good production next year, process and plant good red clover." (Zhang Youren)
　　Chen Yongkai Mutual Aid Team Sells 8,000 Jin of Surplus Grain
　　"Sell surplus grain to the state to further improve production" is the unanimous opinion of the members of the Chen Yongkai Mutual Aid Team in Shuikou Village, Longmen Township, Ninth District, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province. In late October, the Chen Yongkai Mutual Aid Team held two meetings to discuss the significance of state grain purchases. Everyone unanimously agreed: "Selling surplus grain to the state allows us to have the capital to expand production; if the state controls the grain, workers can produce more steel, iron, farm tools, fertilizers, etc., to help farmers produce more grain." Chen Yongkai said: "Grain is a dead thing at home; it can only decrease, not increase. After selling it, we can buy farm tools and fertilizer and use them in production, so we can produce more grain and improve our lives." The entire team sold 8,000 jin of rice to the state. After selling the grain, the team members actively invested the money in production. The entire team bought 500 jin of oil cake and 230 jin of ammonium sulfate from the cooperative, bought eight more pigs, and deposited 2.7 million yuan in the bank. With joy, the team members are sowing small spring crops and preparing to apply topdressing fertilizer, striving for increased production next year. (Cheng Yihua)

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    模范互助组也是售粮模范组
    湖南省平江县第三区国福乡刘天保互助组，去年因为生产搞的好，被评为全县甲等模范互助组。今年秋季国家开始收购粮食以后，这个互助组在当地干部的帮助下，对卖粮给国家的意义作了讨论。组员们把今年国家借给的贷款算了一下账：国家银行今年贷给该组农业贷款和耕牛、肥料贷款二百余万元；全组用这些贷款添买了两头耕牛、三副耙齿、其他农具三十七件，并修理了五张犁。这对今年的生产起了很大作用。组员们从这些事实体会到政府是处处为人民着想，工业对农业生产的帮助是很大的。组员们还回想到今年夏季当地缺粮时，政府从贵州运米来供应，农民才没有吃奸商的亏。许多组员说：我们把粮食卖给国家，国家掌握了足够的粮食，才能保证不缺粮，保证物价稳定。组员们纷纷把余粮卖给国家，全组共卖五千斤。
    在刘天保互助组的带动下，国福乡农民在几天内就卖给国家余粮一万八千多斤。因此刘天保互助组得到了“售粮模范组”的红旗。（陈铭烈）
    积极响应国家号召
    山西省离石县第五区新山湾村农民邓万荣，积极响应把余粮卖给国家的号召，自动多吃粗粮，少吃细粮，把两石小麦卖给了国家。
    他为什么这样积极地响应把余粮卖给国家的号召呢？邓万荣自己的回答是：听共产党和人民政府的话永远没有错。过去听共产党和人民政府的话，得的好处太多了。一九五○年，响应党和政府的号召，参加了互助组，生产提高了，生活有了改善。可是当时还没有力量买牛啦、羊啦这些牲畜。当年政府又号召组织信用合作社，我们也入了股。我们互助组从信用合作社贷款买了三十只羊。现在羊款已经还清，羊已经繁殖到二百九十只，能值一百六十石小米。这还不都是相信共产党和人民政府的话才得到的好处吗！现在党和政府号召把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设，就看看工业对咱们的帮助吧。这几年，工人老大哥给我们制造了很多步犁、农药、肥料、豆饼，使我们农业才能丰产。比如今年我的二亩莜麦地，用新犁耕了一次，用赛力散拌了种，结果打了一石六斗莜麦，比去年增产一倍。过去布匹、油、盐、火柴等工业品贵的要命，买一包火柴就得八升小米，现在工业品便宜了，买一包火柴只要八合小米。这还不都是沾了工业发展的光呀！现在我们把余粮积极卖给国家，工业发展了，我们的生产就能更加提高，生活就能更加改善。

    掀起了爱国售粮热潮
    河南省鲁山县下汤区桑盘乡农民群众，在党员、互助组带动下，掀起了爱国售粮热潮。
    十月底，中共桑盘乡支部召开了全体党员会议，说明把余粮卖给国家对国家建设的意义。会上，党员纷纷自报卖粮，其中九个党员就自报卖余粮一千五百六十二斤。会后，桑盘乡支部首先领导张现五、张怀真两个互助组进行了讨论。这两个互助组通过总结生产成绩，回忆对比解放前后的物价，组员们都认识到发展工业对农民的生产和生活的好处。如张义田说：“今秋俺一亩八分密植谷子丰产啦，收了二千一百一十五斤。这是因为分期上了三十五斤肥田粉，又用六六六粉杀死了害虫。要不是工人生产出肥田粉和虫药来，咱农民怎么也想不出好办法。”当谈到解放后盐价便宜了的时候，大家都感动地说：过去咱们这山里吃盐像吃金子一样，现在家家户户都能用很便宜的价钱买到海盐，从这里也可以看出发展工业的好处。经过讨论，这两个互助组中的十八户农民，先后卖给国家余粮三千四百余斤。十一月二日，、全乡召开了群众大会，介绍这两个互助组和孙荣庆爱国售粮的模范行为。全乡有一百零八户农民都表示要把余粮卖给国家。十一月四日，桑盘乡组织了集体售粮。下汤区供销合作社这一天就收购了九千一百多斤粮食。目前这一爱国售粮热潮正在全区广泛展开。（崔志远、刘东安）
    卖粮准备明年大生产
    江西省萍乡县二区年丰乡，今年普遍获得丰收，差不多是“家家有余粮，户户有谷卖”。许多农民都积极把余粮卖给国家，扩大生产，争取明年更大的丰收。老年农民廖瑞生卖给国家九百斤稻谷；卖粮后，买了一千三百斤石灰，添做了一个可以盛三百多担粪的大粪窖。他说：“我活了快七十岁了，过去看到的总是新谷上市价钱低，青黄不接时谷价贵，从来没有见过像解放后这样物价平稳的好世界。所以我要赶快把余粮卖掉，投入生产。”农民姚梅照卖给国家八百多斤余粮，添置了农具，盖了两个新猪栏。杨伯桂互助组卖粮后，把小水牛换成了大水牛。全乡农民生产积极性很高。过去这里的农民对种肥田的草很不重视，都说：“草籽种下不要管，明年春天它会长。”现在这个乡里到处可以听到有人在讲：“若要明年生产好，加工种好红花草。”（张有仁）
    陈永开互助组卖余粮八千斤
    “把余粮卖给国家，进一步搞好生产”，是四川省江津县第九区龙门乡水口村陈永开互助组组员一致的意见。十月下旬，陈永开互助组开过两次会，讨论国家收购粮食的意义。大家一致认为：把余粮卖给国家，自己才有本钱扩大生产；国家掌握了粮食，工人才能生产更多的钢、铁、农具、肥料等，帮助农民多打粮食。陈永开说：“粮食放在家里是死东西，只有少不能多；卖掉后可以买农具、买肥料，用在生产上，这样粮食就能多打，生活才能改善。”全组卖给国家八千斤稻谷。卖粮后，组员们积极把款子投入生产。全组到合作社买了五百斤油饼、二百三十斤硫酸錏，另外买了八口猪，还存到银行二百七十万元。组员们都满怀喜悦的心情，播种小春作物，并准备施追肥，争取明年增产。（程宜华）
