    Northeast and Southwest First-Level机关干部
    Study the General Line for the Transition Period
    The directly subordinate Party committees of first-level 机关 in the Northeast have organized cadres to study the general line for our country's transition period, according to the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    The directly subordinate机关党委 of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China requires cadres in the advanced and intermediate Level A groups participating in theoretical study to closely combine the study of the general line of the state's transition period with the review of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", and to study the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy and our country's general line and general tasks during the transition period. It also requires them to combine study with work, grasp the essence of the documents, study and handle work from a policy perspective, and raise policies to the level of theory in order to improve ideological understanding. At the same time, in the course of study, they should link it with their own thinking to further enhance their class consciousness in order to do a better job. In terms of learning leadership, administrative departments and Party branches are required to jointly take responsibility, branches should strengthen supervision and inspection, promptly report situations and problems, and organize forces to answer questions. It is also planned to hold a test at the end of November to check the effectiveness of the study. The Party general branches of three units, namely the General Office and the Administrative Office of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, have formulated specific study plans. The Propaganda Department of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Northeast People's Government has listed leading this study as the primary task in the fourth quarter work plan this year, and has provided specific assistance to the propaganda committee members and study group leaders of each branch. The Party committee of the Financial and Economic Affairs Commission of the Northeast People's Government has also made arrangements according to the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau.
    In addition, the advanced group cadres of first-level 机关 in Shenyang City, who participated in theoretical study, carefully read Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related reference documents from July to mid-September. In mid-September, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a supplementary study plan for Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" for the advanced group, combining it with the study of the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period. The specific requirements are: Party members and cadres participating in the advanced group study should continue to carefully read Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents before the end of the year, and, in light of China's specific conditions, raise questions for study and discussion.
    Also, according to a report: Cadres of first-level 机关 in the Southwest and first-level 机关 in Chongqing have comprehensively launched the study of the general line for our country's transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan. More than 20,000 cadres from first-level 机关 in the Southwest alone are participating in this study.
    This study is directly led by the directly subordinate Party committees of first-level 机关 in the Southwest and first-level 机关 in Chongqing. The study time is set at forty days. While studying the general line and general tasks of the transition period, all units will continue to carry out the original theoretical study and strengthen the leadership of the study groups. The original intermediate and elementary group students of theoretical study are all tutored by the advanced group of Party members and cadres. The directly subordinate机关党委 also pointed out the key points of study to the students to help them study better. After earnestly studying and discussing the documents, the 机关 will further examine and improve the work of various departments based on the spirit of the documents and the specific conditions of each department.

    中共中央东北局直属机关党委要求参加理论学习的高级组、中级甲组干部把关于国家过渡时期总路线的学习与“联共（布）党史”第九章的复习密切结合起来，研究苏联新经济政策和我国过渡时期总路线、总任务；把学习和工作结合起来，掌握文件的精神实质，从政策观点来研究和处理工作，把政策提高到理论上来认识，以便提高思想认识水平。同时，在学习中联系自己的思想，进一步提高阶级觉悟，以便更好地做好工作。在学习领导上，要求行政和党支部共同负责，支部加强督促检查，及时反映情况和问题，组织力量解答问题。并拟在十一月底举行测验，检查学习效果。中共中央东北局秘书处、行政处和东北总工会等三个单位的党总支，都订了具体的学习计划。东北行政委员会政法机关党委宣传部把领导这次学习列为今年第四季度工作计划中的首要任务，并对各支部宣传委员、学习小组长进行了具体的帮助。东北行政委员会财经机关的党委，也根据东北局宣传部的指示进行了布置。
    又沈阳市一级机关参加理论学习的高级组干部，从七月到九月中旬精读了“联共（布）党史”第九章及有关参考文件；九月中旬中共沈阳市委又发了高级组“联共（布）党史”第九章学习补充计划，结合学习国家过渡时期总路线、总任务。具体要求是：参加高级组学习的党员干部，在年底前继续精读“联共（布）党史”第九章及有关文件，结合我国的具体情况，提出问题进行学习和讨论。
    又讯：西南一级机关和重庆市一级机关干部，已全面展开关于我国过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年建设计划基本任务的学习。参加这一学习的干部，仅西南一级机关就有二万多人。
    这次学习是由西南一级机关和重庆市一级机关的直属党委直接领导进行的。学习时间规定为四十天。各单位在学习过渡时期的总路线和总任务的同时，仍照样进行原有的理论学习，并加强对学习小组的领导。原来理论学习的中级组和初级组学员，都由高级组的党员干部作学习辅导。各直属机关党委还向学员们指出了学习重点，帮助学员们更好地学习。各机关经过认真学习和讨论文件后，将进一步根据文件精神和各部门的具体情况，检查并改进各部门的工作。　（新华社）
