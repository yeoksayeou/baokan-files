The Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to improve the level of enterprise management and help cadres in various enterprises systematically learn from the advanced experience of Soviet enterprise management, held an enterprise management training class in September 1952, and invited Wang Jiamo, a teacher from the "Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning" teaching and research section of the Renmin University of China, to give lectures in Tianjin. After eight months of lectures and three months of review and examination, the training class ended in August this year and achieved certain results.

A total of 1,740 cadres in service from various factories in Tianjin participated in the training class, including factory directors, functional section chiefs, and workshop directors. Among them, 1,366 cadres were from the industrial sector and 374 cadres were from the Municipal Committee, the Finance Committee, the Trade Union, the newspaper and other departments. The learning method was four hours of lectures per week and four hours of review and discussion.

Because the students were able to study seriously, the content of the lectures met the actual needs of the factories, and the leadership attached importance to it, good results were achieved in teaching. First of all, through this systematic study, the business theoretical level of the cadres has been greatly improved, enabling the students to have a clearer understanding of the tasks and directions of enterprise management, and a more systematic understanding of the theoretical knowledge of enterprise management. Before the study, many cadres lacked knowledge of enterprise management, did not know much about the specific measures and methods related to enterprise management; and knew very little about the content of "planned management" and "technical measures," so they were passive in their work and could only adopt the method of "treating the head when it hurts" and "treating the foot when it hurts." After this study, many leading cadres who did not understand the business before felt "clear in their minds" and found a way to study enterprise management, which greatly enhanced their confidence in their work. At the same time, since the content of the courses absorbed the advanced experience of Soviet enterprise management, the cadres improved their understanding of Soviet advanced experience and their ability to apply Soviet experience in their studies. Many technical and management cadres criticized capitalist management ideology and further realized the essential difference between socialist enterprise management and capitalist enterprise management; they corrected the past erroneous ideas of attaching importance to quantity but not quality, attaching importance to machines but not people, and purely seeking profit, which were caused by insufficient understanding of socialist enterprise management.

Secondly, through this systematic study, the actual work of various factories has also been greatly helped and improved. For example, in the past, the planning work of various factories was not sound, and there was a lack of complete statistical work. Therefore, the figures used in formulating plans were mostly estimated based on experience, without discussion by workers or the organization of technical measures. Therefore, although many factories made plans, they often failed to complete the tasks specified within a long period of time. When preparing the 1953 plan, the teachers explained the "organization of technical measures plans," and the cadres felt that this issue was very important and studied it seriously. Many factories formulated product plans based on the formulation of organizational and technical measures plans, and organized workers to discuss and revise them. This improved the advanced nature and realism of the plan. For example, when the Tianjin Municipal State-owned Woolen Mill revised the 1953 plan, the administrative leadership first proposed the direction of the measures, and after discussion by the masses, formulated a measures plan; and clearly stipulated the steps, persons in charge, and realization dates of the implementation of the plan in the measures plan, and calculated the effect of the measures and the recovery period of the measures costs; and then formulated a group plan and a factory-wide annual plan based on the measures plan. Due to the formulation of the measures plan, the entire factory can save more than 400 million yuan within the 1953 plan. For example, the factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau also saved more than 2 billion yuan for the country due to the preparation of measures plans.

Precisely because the planning work of various factories was not sound in the past, there was even less talk about the planned management of enterprises. Phenomena such as work stoppages due to waiting for materials, slack in the front and tight in the back, slack here and tight there, overtime rushes, and waste of working hours generally and seriously existed in many factories. After studying the work plan and scheduling work, the leadership of many factories clearly understood the great significance and methods of organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts for ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan.

In the past, some factories neglected product quality, which caused product backlog. This situation has changed since learning "technical supervision organization." Like the Tianjin Knitting Factory, in the past, due to the poor quality of products, a large number of products were backlogged. When the inspection personnel put forward their opinions, the factory director sometimes did not support them, which caused an antagonistic mood between the workshop cadres and the inspection personnel. Since the leading cadres of the factory listened to "technical supervision organization," after ideological examination, this situation was changed, and the original inspection section was reorganized into a technical supervision section, and the responsibilities of the section were clearly recognized; and the laboratory was also placed under the leadership of the section. This not only strengthened the supervision of product quality, but also strengthened the supervision of operating procedures. For example, the Tianjin Paper Mill also significantly improved the quality of its products due to the improvement of technical supervision work.

In addition, most enterprise leaders have put forward the direction of future efforts based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, in light of the problems existing in their own units.

### 中共天津市委举办企业管理训练班  对加强各厂计划管理和提高干部业务水平起了一定作用

    中共天津市委举办企业管理训练班
    对加强各厂计划管理和提高干部业务水平起了一定作用
    中共天津市委工业部为了提高企业管理水平，帮助各企业在职干部系统地学习苏联企业管理的先进经验，于一九五二年九月举办了企业管理训练班，邀请中国人民大学“工业企业组织与计划”教研室教员王嘉谟到天津讲课。经八个月的讲授和三个月的复习考试，训练班已于今年八月间结束，并取得了一定的成绩。
    参加训练班的学员，有天津市各工厂的厂长、职能科长、车间主任等在职干部共一千七百四十人。其中计工业部门的干部一千三百六十六人，市委、财委、工会、报社等部门的干部三百七十四人。学习方法是每周讲授四小时，复习和讨论四小时。
    由于学员能认真地学习，讲授内容切合工厂实际的需要，加上领导方面的重视，在教学上取得了良好的效果。首先，通过这次系统的学习，大大提高了干部的业务理论水平，使学员们对企业管理的任务与方向有了较明确的认识，对企业管理的理论知识有了较系统的了解。在学习前许多干部对企业管理的知识异常缺乏，不甚了解有关企业管理的具体措施及方法；对“计划管理”、“技术措施”的内容也知道得很少，因此在工作中处于被动，只能采取“头痛医头”、“脚痛医脚”的办法。经过这次学习后，许多原来不懂业务的领导干部感觉“心里亮堂”了，找到了钻研企业管理的门径，大大地增强了工作的信心。同时，由于课程的内容吸收了苏联企业管理的先进经验，使干部们在学习中提高了对苏联先进经验的认识，也提高了运用苏联经验的能力。许多技术干部与管理干部批判了资本主义经营思想，进一步认识到社会主义企业管理与资本主义企业管理本质上的不同；纠正了过去由于对社会主义企业管理认识不足而引起的重量不重质，重机器不重人，单纯营利等等错误思想。
    其次，通过这次系统的学习，对各厂的实际工作也有较大的帮助与改进。譬如，过去各厂计划工作都不健全，缺乏完整的统计工作，因此制订计划时所依据的数字，大多是凭经验估计的，既不经过工人的讨论，也没有组织技术措施。因此，许多厂虽然作出了计划，往往在长时期内完成不了规定的任务。在编制一九五三年计划时，教员讲解了“组织技术措施计划”，干部们感到这个问题很重要，都认真地进行了学习。许多工厂在制定组织技术措施计划的基础上订出了产品计划，并组织工人讨论加以修正补充。这就提高了计划的先进性和现实性。如天津市地方国营毛织厂在修订一九五三年计划时，首先由行政领导方面提出措施的方向，经过群众讨论以后，订出了措施计划；并在措施计划中明确规定了执行计划的步骤、负责人及实现日期，计算出措施的效果与措施费用的收回期等；然后根据措施计划制定出小组计划及全厂年度计划。由于制定了措施计划，全厂在一九五三年计划内即可节约四亿多元。又如华北纺织管理局所属各厂，也因编制措施计划而为国家节约二十多亿元。
    正因为过去各厂计划工作都不健全，所以也就更谈不到企业的计划管理。许多厂内普遍而严重地存在着停工待料，前松后紧，此松彼紧，加班突击，浪费工时等现象。学习了作业计划与调度工作以后，很多厂的领导方面都明确地了解了企业按指示图表、组织有节奏的生产对保证完成与超额完成国家计划的重大意义及其方法。
    过去有些厂由于忽视产品的质量，曾造成产品积压现象。学习“技术监督组织”以后，使这种情况有了改变。像天津针织厂，过去因为产品质量低劣，积压大批产品，检验人员提出意见时，厂长有时不予支持，使车间干部和检验人员之间产生了对立的情绪。自该厂领导干部听了“技术监督组织”以后，经过思想检查，改变了这种情况，把原来的检验科加以整顿，改变为技术监督科，明确认识了该科的职责；并把化验室也划归该科领导。这样不但加强了对产品质量的监督，同时也加强了对操作程序的监督。又如天津造纸总厂也因改进技术监督工作而使产品质量显著提高。
    此外，大多数企业领导同志都根据苏联先进经验，针对着本单位存在的问题提出了今后的努力方向。
