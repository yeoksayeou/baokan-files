    The Chinese Musicians Association, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries jointly held a commemorative evening party in Beijing on the 9th to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the death of the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky. More than 500 people attended, including composers, performers, heads of literary and art groups, and amateur music lovers from Beijing.
    Chinese composer Ma Ke spoke at the meeting. He said: Tchaikovsky used musical art to depict the psychological and spiritual outlook of the Russian people on the eve of the storm. We Chinese music workers should not only study Tchaikovsky's great works now, but also learn from the glorious achievements of Soviet music workers in inheriting and developing classical music. Subsequently, Soviet friend and professor of the Renmin University of China, Zivikova, was invited to speak. She said: Tchaikovsky's works have become an indispensable part of the socialist culture of the Soviet people. The most prominent feature of Tchaikovsky's works is the strong expression of the Russian people's desire for light and happiness at that time. The works of this great and outstanding son of Russia, symbolizing peace, beauty, and a happy life, are admired and loved by people all over the world.
    During the meeting, recordings of Tchaikovsky's most outstanding works performed by the Honored Symphony Orchestra and Honored Actors of the Leningrad State Philharmonic Hall of the Soviet Union were played, including the "1812 Overture," the entire "Sixth Symphony," selections from the ballet "The Nutcracker," and the "Andante of the First String Quartet."
