    Henan Province, Suixian County, Sixth District
    Convenes People's Representatives Meeting to Mobilize Farmers to Sell Grain
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Sixth District of Suixian County, Henan Province, convened a meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in early November to discuss issues such as carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and mobilizing farmers to sell grain to support national construction.

    The Secretary of the Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Suixian County and the Head of the Sixth District of Suixian County gave reports at the meeting, explaining the role of national grain purchases in the country's socialist industrialization, mobilizing everyone to increase production and practice economy, sell surplus grain to the state, expand production, and support national economic construction. In group discussions, the representatives talked about the benefits farmers have received from the country's continuous reduction of industrial product prices over the past few years: in the past, one *dou* of wheat could be exchanged for at most three to five *jin* of sugar, but now it can be exchanged for more than twenty *jin*; in the past, it took several *dou* of wheat to make a suit of clothes, but now only one *dou* of wheat is enough. From these practical examples, the representatives realized that selling surplus grain to the state is the glorious responsibility of farmers and a practical action to support industrial construction, because with the development of industry, farmers can buy more and cheaper farm tools and daily necessities, and live a better socialist life sooner. The representatives also experienced the need for the state to have sufficient grain reserves from the state's sufficient supply of grain when the district suffered from frost this spring. Many representatives said: This spring, the government transported large quantities of grain from Sichuan, Suiyuan, the Northeast, and other places thousands of miles away to supply us at reasonable prices. Otherwise, this spring would have been like the famine in 1943 before liberation, and we don't know how many people would have starved to death. It seems that only when the state controls the grain can prices be stable and can we guarantee that there will be no shortage of grain. Some representatives also talked about the benefits of selling surplus grain to expand production. They said: If we store surplus grain, it is dead grain. Selling it to the state can accomplish great things. It can not only support industrial construction and consolidate national defense, but also turn dead grain into a "treasure" to expand production and produce more grain. Some representatives talked about the benefits of depositing surplus grain in cooperatives: If you don't need money right now, you can deposit the surplus grain in the cooperative, and the price will rise but not fall. You can take it out whenever you need money, which is both safe and patriotic. Storing it yourself is easy to damage and has no benefits.

    After recognizing these principles, representatives Liang Xinming and You Qingquan immediately expressed their willingness to sell 1,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. The representatives praised these two representatives on the spot. After discussion, many representatives reversed their original thinking that the district was a disaster area with no surplus grain and their unwillingness to sell surplus grain, and expressed their willingness to sell surplus grain to the state. At the meeting, the representatives reported that they would sell more than 170,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. The representatives expressed that they would take the lead in selling grain after returning, mobilize the masses to sell surplus grain to the state, invest the proceeds from the sale of grain in production or deposit it in the bank, and mobilize households with enough grain to eat not to buy grain for hoarding.

    河南省睢县第六区
    召开人民代表会议动员农民卖粮
    【本报讯】河南省睢县第六区在十一月上旬召开了区各界人民代表会议，讨论开展增产节约运动和动员农民卖粮支援国家建设等问题。
    中共睢县第六区区委书记和睢县第六区区长在会上作报告，说明国家收购粮食对国家社会主义工业化的作用，动员大家增产节约，把余粮卖给国家，扩大生产，支援国家经济建设。在小组讨论中，代表们谈到了几年来国家不断降低工业品价格对农民的好处：过去一斗小麦最多能换三、五斤糖，现在能换二十多斤；过去做一身衣服要用几斗小麦，现在只要一斗小麦就足够了。代表们从这些实际的事例，认识到把余粮卖给国家是农民的光荣责任，是支持工业建设的实际行动，因为工业发展了，农民才能买到更多更便宜的农具和日用品，才能早日过美好的社会主义社会的生活。代表们又从本区今春发生霜灾时国家充分供应粮食的情况，体验到国家必须掌握足够的粮食。许多代表说：今春政府从四川、绥远、东北等几千里以外运来大批粮食以合理的价格供给咱们，不然的话，今春就要像解放前一九四三年闹灾荒时那样，不知道要饿死多少人。看起来，只有国家掌握了粮食，物价才会稳定，才能保证不缺粮。有些代表还谈到卖出余粮扩大生产的好处。他们说：咱把余粮放起来是死粮食，卖给国家才可办大事哩，不但能支持工业建设，巩固国防，还能变死粮为“活宝”，扩大生产，多打粮食。有的代表谈到把余粮存到合作社的好处：要是眼下不用钱，可把余粮存到合作社，价钱听涨不听落，啥时用钱啥时取，又保险，又爱国。自己存放着容易损耗，没有啥好处。
    代表梁新明、尤清泉认清这些道理后，马上表示要将一千斤余粮卖给国家。代表们当场表扬了这两位代表。经过讨论，许多代表扭转了原来认为本区是灾区没有余粮，以及不愿出卖余粮的思想，纷纷表示要将余粮卖给国家。代表们在会上自报要卖给国家的余粮，有十七万余斤。代表们纷纷表示回去后要带头卖粮，动员群众把余粮卖给国家，把卖粮得到的款子投入生产，或存入银行，并动员有粮吃的户不买粮囤积。
