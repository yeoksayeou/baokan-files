Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 4th: The Korean Military Armistice Commission, Korean-Chinese Delegation, issued the following communiqué on November 3rd:

Zhang Zilong, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Camp No. 28 of the Dongchang-ri POW camp under the control of the Indian Custodial Forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, was brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents on October 2nd for shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" during a demonstration, instigated by Chiang Kai-shek agents, to sabotage the custodial arrangements. This tragic incident was exposed on October 7th by Huang Lichao, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers who escaped from the special agent control in that camp and was repatriated to our side. Based on the firm demand of the Korean-Chinese side, the Indian Custodial Forces began an on-site investigation on November 1st. However, due to serious sabotage by the special agents, the investigation in Camp No. 28 on November 1st yielded no results and was forced to be suspended. The murderer pointed out by Huang Lichao on the spot was also not arrested. However, during the investigation on November 1st, two captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Camp No. 28 rushed towards the Chinese and Korean reporters outside the barbed wire fence, climbed the fence, and demanded repatriation, one of them shouting "Long live Chairman Mao." The special agents in the camp, in front of hundreds of Indian Custodial Forces, observing representatives from various member countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and reporters from both sides of the Korean armistice, dragged the two POWs down and brutally beat them on the spot with flagpoles brought into the camp by the special agents. This shows the extent to which the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp have become rampant in sabotaging the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," defying the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, and persecuting POWs to prevent them from applying for repatriation. Under such circumstances, the POWs' genuine opportunity to apply for repatriation and the safety of their lives are completely unguaranteed. The Korean-Chinese side immediately and firmly demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces rescue these two captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and continue the investigation and arrest the murderers.

On November 2nd, the Indian Custodial Forces took necessary measures and conducted a serious investigation. As a result, seven murderers were arrested on the spot, and sixteen witnesses were isolated, all of whom are currently being interrogated by the Indian Custodial Forces. In the process of the Indian Custodial Forces investigating and arresting the main culprits in the murder of Zhang Zilong by Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents, seventeen captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Camp No. 28 applied for repatriation on the spot. This fully proves that the necessary condition for implementing the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and enabling all captured Korean-Chinese personnel to truly have the opportunity to apply for repatriation lies in stopping the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents and eliminating their organizations, as the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out.

Obviously, the special agents in Camp No. 28 are far more than the seven principal culprits in the murder of Zhang Zilong arrested on November 2nd. The entire Dongchang-ri POW camp, in addition to Camp No. 28, has another fifty-two camps, each of which has a large number of well-organized special agents. Recently, a spokesperson for the Indian Custodial Forces pointed out that each camp in the Dongchang-ri POW camp has approximately fifty or more special agents. But the facts of November 2nd have also fully proven that the difficulty of eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents can be completely overcome, that the special agents can be gradually eliminated, and that the claim that "eliminating the special agents will cause a large number of casualties among the POWs" is completely unfounded.

The Indian Custodial Forces' serious investigation into the Zhang Zilong murder case, which began on November 2nd, is welcome. People all over the world hopefully regard it as the first step taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to adopt practical and effective measures to stop the activities of special agents, eliminate their organizations, and thereby guarantee the implementation of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits." The murderers who assassinated Zhang Zilong still await strict punishment by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces. The remaining large number of special agents in Camp No. 28, as well as the large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents deployed by the U.S. side in other camps, still need to be eliminated. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces will face difficulties in continuing to eliminate the special agents, but these difficulties have been proven to be surmountable. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces will receive the unanimous support and assistance of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world in carrying out this task.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团发表公报
    支持中立国遣返委员会彻查张子龙被害案
    要求严惩凶手并继续清除特务以保证“职权范围”的实施
    【新华社开城四日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团十一月三日发表公报如下：
    中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队看管下的东场里战俘营第二十八号营场内的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙，因在十月二日蒋匪特务挟持进行的破坏看管的示威中高呼“毛主席万岁”，为蒋匪特务挖心杀害。这一惨案于十月七日即为自该营场逃出特务控制遣返我方的中国人民志愿军被俘人员黄立超所揭露。基于朝中方面的坚决要求，印度看管部队在十一月一日开始对此进行现场调查。但由于特务的严重破坏，十一月一日在二十八号营场的调查工作未获任何结果，即被迫宣告中断。为黄立超所当场指出的凶手，亦未能予以逮捕。但在十一月一日的调查中，有二十八号营场的两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员冲向铁丝网外的朝中方面的新闻记者，攀登铁丝网，要求遣返，其中之一高呼“毛主席万岁”，而该营场的特务竟当着数百名印度看管部队、中立国遣返委员会各委员国的观察代表以及朝鲜停战双方新闻记者的面，将那二名战俘拖了下来，并当场用特务带进营场的旗杆予以毒打。这说明东场里战俘营的蒋、李特务破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”、蔑视中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队、并迫害战俘使之不得申请遣返，已经到了何等猖狂的地步。在这种情况下，战俘申请遣返的真正机会与他们生命的安全，已完全没有保障。朝中方面乃立即向中立国遣返委员会及印度看管部队坚决要求抢救这两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，并要求继续进行调查并逮捕凶手。
    十一月二日，印度看管部队采取了必要的措施，认真地进行了调查，结果当场逮捕了七名凶手，隔离了十六个证人，现均正由印度看管部队讯问中。在印度看管部队进行调查并逮捕蒋匪特务中谋害张子龙的主犯的过程中，就有二十八号营场的十七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员当场申请遣返。这就充分证明了：实施“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，使全部朝中被俘人员真正有申请遣返的机会之必要条件，正如朝中方面所一再指出的，在于制止蒋、李特务的活动，清除蒋、李特务的组织。
    很显然，第二十八号营场的特务远不止十一月二日所逮捕的七名谋杀张子龙的主凶，而整个东场里战俘营，除第二十八号营场外，还有另外的五十二个营场，这些营场的每一个又都有着大批组织严密的特务。最近印度看管部队的发言人就曾经指出：东场里战俘营的每一个营场都约有五十名以上的特务。但十一月二日的事实也已充分证明：清除蒋、李特务的困难是完全可以克服的，特务是完全可以逐步清除的，所谓“清除特务将造成战俘的大量伤亡”的说法，是完全没有根据的。
    印度看管部队于十一月二日开始认真调查张子龙惨案，是值得欢迎的。全世界人民都满怀希望地把它当作是中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队采取实际有效措施以制止特务活动，清除特务组织，从而保证“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”以及“解释和访问工作细则”的实施的第一步。暗杀张子龙的凶犯，仍然有待中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队的严格惩办，二十八号营场剩余的大批特务，以及其他各营场中美方所布置的大批蒋、李特务，仍然有待于清除。中立国遣返委员会及印度看管部队在继续清除特务的道路上，不是没有困难的，但这些困难已被证明是可以克服的。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在执行这一任务时，将得到全世界爱好和平、主张正义的人民的一致的赞助与支持。
