Building the Borderlands of the Motherland

    Xinjiang's First Automated Power Plant
    Xinjiang's first automated thermal power plant—the Dihua Power Plant—has completed the installation of its machinery and equipment two months ahead of schedule. After partial trial runs, the quality fully meets Soviet technical standards. It is now actively preparing for formal power transmission.
    The power generation capacity of the Dihua Power Plant is 1.4 times the original power generation capacity of the entire Xinjiang province. Its completion will greatly promote the economic construction of Xinjiang Province. It will supply Dihua City and the surrounding factories and mines with sufficient power. The production costs of various factories and mines will gradually decrease with the supply of cheap electricity. In the past, due to the lack of electricity, more than 1,400 handicraft households and workshops in Dihua City were greatly restricted in their production. In the future, these handicrafts can also make full use of electricity to develop production.
    The Dihua Power Plant was designed by Soviet experts and equipped with the most advanced Soviet technology and the latest machinery. From the electric coal conveyor belt that sends coal into the boiler to the generator that generates electricity, the entire production process is operated automatically by machines.
    During the machine installation process of the Dihua Power Plant, Soviet experts not only provided direct guidance, but also personally installed key parts. Installation workers from Beijing, the Northeast, and other places also supported the industrial construction of the motherland's borderlands with selfless labor. Therefore, the entire power plant installation project, which started in July, was completed in October. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    Shaft Project on the Lesser Khingan Mountains
    Deep in the Lesser Khingan Mountains in the northeastern borderlands of the motherland, a pair of huge coal mine shaft projects are under intense construction. This pair of shafts is divided into main and auxiliary shafts, both with a shaft diameter of six and a half meters. The main shaft is 193 meters long, and the auxiliary shaft is 181 meters long. Below this pair of shafts, an area of ​​more than ten square miles will be developed, and hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of tunnels will be excavated and blasted to construct offices, employee rest rooms, substations, tram garages, explosive depots, tool depots, water reservoirs, waiting rooms, clinics, underground canteens, and the laying of mine electric railways. The scale of these projects is not small, such as the waiting room that can accommodate 300 people, and the water reservoir that can store 15,000 tons of water. After completion, this place will become an underground city for miners to work. After the commissioning of this pair of shafts, it will produce a large amount of coal for the motherland.
    This pair of shaft projects started construction in August last year, and the two shaft projects were completed by the end of August this year. Such a huge project would have taken four or five years to complete before liberation. Now, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the active work of the employees, it was completed in just one year, and the project quality fully meets the prescribed standards. At present, all employees have launched a production increase and thrift campaign, determined to strive for early completion. (Sun Zongwu, Huang Tao)

    Crossing the Wushaoling Mountains, Advancing Towards Xinjiang
    Wushaoling—3,000 meters above sea level, with towering peaks stretching sixty kilometers from east to west. The climate on the ridge is often around minus five degrees Celsius, and it has snowed three times in September. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will pass straight through here. Under the call of Chairman Mao to "Celebrate the opening of the Tianlan Road and continue to work hard to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road," the road construction workers are waging a struggle against high mountains, deep ditches, cliffs, and rapid currents: drilling tunnels, building valley bridges, constructing culverts, and repairing mountain slopes. Stonemasons learned advanced Soviet experience, and the work efficiency of making stone slabs was increased by three times. Earthworkers have already dug out nearly 50,000 tons of yellow sand to support the needs of various projects.
    The local Tibetan compatriots enthusiastically supported the road construction workers. They built a 20-kilometer-long road, allowing cars to quickly enter the construction site and transport many machines and materials.
    When the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine heard the news of the construction of the Wushaoling road, they were all overjoyed. A worker's congratulatory letter wrote: "We will let oil flow like a river, hoping you will build the railway here soon!"
    At present, the Wushaoling project is nearing completion, and the train has reached a place five kilometers away from Wushaoling. The construction site is filled with joyful songs: "Trees need people to plant, roads need people to open; the people's Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road, the people build it!" (Zhang Shoukao)

    People Who Have Never Seen a Train Before Are Now Riding Trains
    A new railway is being built on the grasslands and deserts of the northern borderlands of the motherland.
    As soon as the workers arrived at the construction site, the local fraternal ethnic residents helped them carry their luggage and find accommodation as if they were welcoming relatives. The women were busy boiling water, sweeping the houses, and helping the workers wash their clothes, as close as a family.
    The employees of the Third Railway Engineering Bureau overcame wind and sand and mountain floods, and continued to advance. The road construction project started on May 1st and began laying tracks on June 15th. A red flag competition was launched at the construction site. In two months, the employees put forward more than 90 suggestions, saving the country more than 1.3 billion yuan. The bridge erection team promoted advanced experience, shortening the time to erect a bridge from two and a half hours to one and a half hours. In the thunderstorm, Communist Party member Li Youcai led the workers to fight the mountain torrents. Although he injured his wrist and fainted on the river beach, the employees finally rescued hundreds of cubic meters of wood from the torrents. By the end of August, 85 kilometers of tracks had been laid. Long trains transported large quantities of materials to the forward construction site.
    The project is progressing rapidly, and trains are running on the newly built railway. Local fraternal ethnic farmers and herdsmen came from far away in horse-drawn carts and riding livestock to visit. When they saw that the bulldozer could push four cubic meters of soil at a time, and one person could drive a train to pull so many things, they were infinitely excited. An old man holding a crutch touched the stopped train and said: "When the Kuomintang bandits were here, they robbed and extorted, and the people could not live. After liberation, our lives have gradually improved. Chairman Mao cares about us and sent people to repair the railway. People who have never seen a train before can now ride trains!" (Wang Shaobo)

    Building a Factory on the Gobi Desert
    In the western frontier of the motherland—on the Gobi Desert of Eastern Xinjiang—stands a tall building, with chimneys spitting out billowing smoke day and night. This is the Red Star Flour Mill and the Red Star Power Plant built by the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Hami.
    During the construction of this project, the soldiers established a technical research group, created a hand-operated trolley, solved the problem of high-altitude transportation, which was light, easy, safe, and saved more than a thousand labor forces. The large chimney was a key project, and many soldiers had never seen it before. However, they worked hard and built a 35.6-meter-high chimney in just 35 days. Farmers of all ethnic groups passing by gave their thumbs up in praise.
    The Red Star Flour Mill started trial production in July this year. Now it operates for 16 to 18 hours a day, producing 320 to 350 bags of flour, totaling more than 14,000 jin. Now it can not only supply flour for the troops, but also provide some food for the residents of Hami City. In the future, it is also planned to add a power generator to ensure uninterrupted power supply 24 hours a day, and to install electric lights in Hami City in October, so that this border city will be brightly lit.

    建设祖国的边疆
    新疆第一座自动化的电厂
    新疆第一座自动化的火力发电厂——迪化电厂的机器设备已提前两个月安装完毕，经局部试车，质量完全合乎苏联技术标准。现正积极准备正式送电。
    迪化电厂的发电能力等于新疆全省原有发电能力的一点四倍。它的建成，将大大推进新疆省的经济建设。它将供给迪化市及市区附近各个工厂、矿山以充足的电力。各工厂、矿山的产品成本将随着廉价电力的供应而逐渐降低。过去由于电力缺乏，迪化市的一千四百多家手工业户和作坊在生产上受到很大的限制；今后，这些手工业也可以充分利用电力发展生产了。
    迪化电厂是由苏联专家设计，并用苏联最先进的技术和最新式的机器装备起来的。从电动输煤带把煤送进锅炉直到发电机发电，全部生产过程都由机器自动来操作。
    迪化电厂在机器安装过程中，苏联专家不仅直接指导，并且亲自动手安装关键部分。来自北京、东北等地的安装工人也以忘我的劳动支援了祖国边疆的工业建设。因此，从七月份开始的整个电厂的安装工程，到十月份就全部完成。（据新华社讯）
    小兴安岭上的竖井工程
    在祖国东北边疆小兴安岭深处，有一对巨大的煤矿竖井工程正在紧张地施工。这对竖井分主、副两井，井身直径均为六公尺半，主井井筒全长一百九十三公尺，副井井筒全长一百八十一公尺。在这对井筒下面还要开辟方圆十几里的地区，开凿和发?数十万公尺的巷道，建设办公室、职工休息室、变电所、电车库、炸药库、工具库、水仓、候车室、诊疗所、井下食堂以及铺设摩电铁路等。这些工程规模都不小，如候车室可容三百人，水仓可储水一万五千吨。竣工之后，这里将变成矿工劳动的地下城市。这对竖井开工后，将为祖国出产大量的煤。
    这对竖井工程从去年八月开工，到今年八月底两个井筒工程已经竣工。这样巨大的工程，解放前要四、五年才能完成。现在，我们有了苏联专家的热情帮助，加上职工们的积极工作，仅仅一年的时间就完成了，而且工程质量完全合乎规定标准。目前，全体职工展开了增产节约运动，坚决为早日完工而奋斗。　（孙宗武、黄涛）
    跨过乌鞘岭，向新疆前进
    乌鞘岭——拔海三千公尺，高峰横亘，东西长达六十公里。岭上气候经常在零下五度左右，九月里已经下过三次大雪。兰新铁路就要从这里直穿而过。修路工人在毛主席“庆贺天兰路通车，继续努力修筑兰新路”的号召下，向高山、深沟、悬崖和急流展开斗争：钻隧道、架沟桥、筑涵洞、修山坡。石工学习了苏联先进经验，制石片的工作效率提高了三倍。土工已经挖出了近五万吨的黄沙，支援各种工程的需要。
    当地藏族同胞热烈支援筑路工人，他们修了二十公里长的公路，使汽车很快开进工地，运去了许多机器和材料。
    玉门油矿的工人们听到乌鞘岭筑路的消息，个个欢欣鼓舞。一个工人的祝贺信上写道：“我们要让石油像河一样的流，希望你们快把铁路修到这里来！”
    目前，乌鞘岭的工程快要完成了，火车已开到离乌鞘岭有五公里的地方。工地里洋溢着欢乐的歌声：“树要人来栽，路要人来开；人民的兰新路，人民修起来！”　（张寿考）
    从没见过火车的人也坐火车了
    在祖国北部边疆的草原和沙漠上，正在修建一条新的铁路。
    工人们一到工地，当地兄弟民族的居民就像迎接亲人一样地帮助他们背行李、找住处。妇女们忙着烧开水，扫房子，帮助工人洗衣服，亲热得如同一家人。
    第三铁路工程局的职工战胜了风沙、山洪，不断前进。修路工程从五月一日开工，六月十五日开始钉道。工地里展开了红旗竞赛，两个月中职工们提出九十多条建议，为国家节省了十三亿余元。架桥队推广了先进经验，使架一孔桥的时间，由二时半缩短到一时半。雷雨中，共产党员李有才带动工人与山洪搏斗，虽然他手腕碰伤昏倒在河滩上，但职工们终于将几百方木料从急流中抢救出来。施工到八月底已铺轨八十五公里。长列的火车把大批材料运往前方工地。
    工程迅速进展着，火车奔驰在新建的铁路上。当地兄弟民族的农民和牧民，从很远的地方坐着马车骑着牲口来参观。当他们看到推土机一次能推四方土，一个人开动火车拉那么多东西奔跑的情景，感到无限兴奋。一位扶着拐杖的老汉摸着停下来的火车说：“国民党匪帮在这里的时候，抢劫勒索，老百姓活不成。解放后，我们的生活逐渐提高，毛主席关心我们，派人来修理铁路，从来没见过火车的人也能坐火车了！”　（王绍柏）
    戈壁滩上修工厂
    在祖国西陲——东疆的戈壁滩上，矗立起一座高大的楼房，烟囱日夜吐着滚滚的烟。这就是驻哈密的中国人民解放军修建起来的红星面粉厂和红星发电厂。
    在这一工程修建中，战士们成立了技术研究组，创造了手搬滑车，解决了高空运输问题，又轻快，又省劲，不出危险，节省了劳动力一千多个。大烟囱是一个关键工程，许多战士都没有看见过。但他们苦心钻研，仅用三十五天的时间就修起了三十五点六公尺高的烟囱。过路的各族农民，都伸起大姆指称赞不已。
    红星面粉厂今年七月已开始试机生产，现在每天开动十六至十八小时，可产粉三百二十袋至三百五十袋，共重一万四千多斤，现在不仅可供部队用粉，并已供给哈密城居民部分食用。今后还准备再添置一部动力发电机，保证昼夜二十四小时不停供电，并准备在十月份将哈密城内电灯装好，使这个边塞的城市大放光明。　（汤次华、雷霆）
