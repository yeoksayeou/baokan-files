    Bumper Harvest Victory at the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" in Changzhi, Shanxi

    The China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, established on a trial basis in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, has achieved a bumper harvest victory in its first year thanks to the enthusiastic learning of Soviet collectivization experiences and diligent labor by the local Communist Party, the People's Government, and all the farm members.

    The Changzhi China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm was established in 1952 during the commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. Over the past year, the 918 farm member households, working on 14,593 mu of land, harvested 3,566,194 jin of wheat, millet, and corn, averaging over 244 jin per mu, exceeding last year's yield by 13.35 percent, exceeding the best mutual aid team in the village by 25.7 percent, and exceeding individual farmers by 43.4 percent. After the autumn harvest, the collective farm implemented the socialist principle of "distribution according to work," with each work-day earning farm members 11 jin and 12 liang of grain. Active agricultural laborers received even more. Farm member Liu Fazhi received a total of 10,612.5 jin of grain this year. He happily said, "Before joining the farm, my 24 mu of land only yielded 5,400 jin of grain. After joining the farm, the amount of grain I received was more than double last year's. If it weren't for joining the collective farm, I wouldn't have dreamed of receiving so much grain." The increased production has further solidified the farm members' confidence in the collective farm. When it was first established, many farm members doubted whether the collective farm would yield more grain and planned to withdraw if they didn't receive enough grain. Now, except for a few people who rely on transportation for a living, most farm members no longer mention withdrawing from the farm. Before the autumn harvest, individual farmers ridiculed the farm members, saying they were unlucky to have joined the farm. Now, seeing the farm members receiving large piles of grain, they are all inquiring whether the farm plans to expand further. They say, "The farm has opened our eyes. To live a good life forever, we must take the path of collectivization." On November 7th, all the farm members held a meeting to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, celebrate the first anniversary of the farm's establishment, and celebrate the victory of increased production. In addition to members of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team members, and individual farmers from nearby the farm, representatives from the Changzhi Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and other organizations came to offer their congratulations. Jia Jun, secretary of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee, read a congratulatory telegram from the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on behalf of the provincial committee. At the meeting, twenty-four model cadres, eighty-one model farm members, and one hundred and ninety-five production activists who had led farm members in actively working and striving for increased production were rewarded. After the meeting, representatives from agricultural production cooperatives and many farmers visited the collective farm. When everyone saw the large tracts of land, three li wide and fifteen li long, that had already been ploughed for autumn planting, they said with great envy, "Look! The collective farm's land has already been ploughed, but we haven't even started on our autumn land. Without organizing, we can never catch up." Individual farmers said after the visit, "The farm has only been in operation for one year, and it has cultivated the land so well. If I can't join the farm next year, I will join a mutual aid team."

    山西长治“中苏友好集体农庄”增产胜利
    山西省长治专区试办的中苏友好集体农庄，已在当地共产党、人民政府和全体庄员的热心学习苏联集体化经验及辛勤劳动下，取得了头一年的增产胜利。
    长治中苏友好集体农庄是在一九五二年纪念十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候成立的。一年来，全庄九百一十八户庄员，在一万四千五百九十三亩土地上，收获了小麦、谷子和玉米三百五十六万六千一百九十四斤，平均每亩收二百四十四斤多，超过去年百分之十三点三五，超过所在村最好互助组百分之二十五点七，超过个体农民百分之四十三点四。秋收后集体农庄实行了社会主义“按劳取酬”的分配原则，庄员每个劳动日分到了十一斤十二两的粮食，积极的农业劳动者分得更多，庄员刘法芝今年共分到一万零六百十二斤半粮食，他高兴地说：“入庄前我二十四亩地，才收了五千四百斤粮，入庄后收的粮食就比去年多了一倍，要不是加入了集体农庄，做梦也不会分这么多粮食。”增产进一步巩固了庄员对集体农庄的信心，刚成立时，许多庄员对集体农庄多收粮食都抱怀疑态度，打算分不到粮食时退庄，现在除专靠运输为生的少数人外，大部庄员都不提退庄的话了。秋收前，单干农民见到庄员们，就讥笑他们入庄倒了霉，现在看到庄员分到大堆大堆的粮食，都去打听农庄是否还要再扩大，他们说：“农庄照亮了我们的眼睛，要想永远过好生活，只有走集体化的道路。”十一月七日，全体庄员举行纪念十月社会主义革命三十六周年和庆祝农庄建庄一周年及庆祝增产胜利大会，这天除农庄附近的农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员和单干农民外，还有中共长治地方委员会、长治专署等机关代表前来祝贺。长治地委书记贾俊代表中共山西省委员会，宣读了省委给中苏友好集体农庄的贺电。会上，奖励了一年中带领庄员积极劳动、争取增产胜利的二十四个模范干部、八十一个模范庄员和一百九十五个生产积极分子。会后，农业生产合作社的代表和许多农民都去参观集体农庄。当大家看到那已经秋耕过的三里宽十五里长的大片土地时，十分羡慕地说：“看！集体农庄的土地已经耕完了，我们的秋地还没有动手，不组织起来，无论怎样也赶不上。”单干农民参观后都说：“农庄才办了一年，就把土地耕得这么好，明年我入不了农庄，也要参加互助组。”（鲁生）
