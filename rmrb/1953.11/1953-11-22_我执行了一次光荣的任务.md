    I Carried Out A Glorious Task
    Drivers Who Welcomed Marshal Kim Il-sung's Special Train Liu Ren Zhang Fang
    On the night of November 11th, when the superiors told me that I was going to Tianjin to accept a glorious task tomorrow, my mood immediately became tense. What task? Suddenly, I thought, the headline on the newspaper that day: Marshal Kim Il-sung led the North Korean government delegation from Pyongyang at noon on the 10th, and they would definitely arrive in Tianjin on the 12th. This must be to welcome them! That night, I did not leave my locomotive, we personally guarded it. My fellow driver Comrade Han Chaoxuan, stoker Comrade Li Liansheng, and I cleaned the locomotive, and the copper parts on the locomotive were shined brightly.
    At half past six in the morning on the 12th, it was foggy. We departed from Beijing. After starting the train, I realized that it was indeed to welcome Marshal Kim Il-sung, and I was extremely excited. Marshal Kim Il-sung arrived safely in Tianjin from Pyongyang, and I must make him ride comfortably along the way. As I drove, I was worried, fearing that the stations along the way would be delayed.
    At Tianjin Station, the three of us carefully checked the locomotive again, and every small place was tapped with an inspection hammer, but we were still not at ease. We replaced more than a dozen new brake shoes and added enough oil to each axle. We must make this train run steadily and not allow any failures.
    At 12:08 noon, there was one minute before departure. When the locomotive started, how could we ensure that Marshal Kim Il-sung would not feel the vibration of the train! I firmly grasped the starting point on the locomotive, and the train began to roll smoothly. The stoker comrades adjusted the coal fire, ensuring that the locomotive would not emit black smoke.
    At three o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Beijing Station. The platform was full of people, who kept applauding and throwing flowers at the locomotive. For some reason, my eyes were filled with tears. The band began to play music, and applause rang out. I thought Marshal Kim Il-sung must have walked onto the platform. I stood on the locomotive and looked into the crowd. Finally, I saw him. He was the one who had led the Korean people to repel the American aggressors for several years! Marshal Kim Il-sung was wearing a black top hat and a black woolen coat. He was tall and fat, and his body was so healthy! He walked side by side with Premier Zhou, and Commander Peng Dehuai, wearing a green military uniform, walked behind. Behind them were many international friends. Marshal Kim Il-sung clapped his hands and walked slowly. My palms were burning from clapping.
    After Marshal Kim Il-sung left the station, my mood felt particularly relaxed after excitement and tension. We have completed this glorious task assigned by the superiors. Looking back at the locomotive that had been with me for four years, I thought of many things. I have been working on the railway since I was sixteen, and it has been eight years now. In the old society, I polished the train for four years, and no one paid attention to me. In the four years since liberation, I have been promoted from train polisher, stoker to full driver, and have been promoted five levels.
    In the past few years, I have made such progress. In addition to the Party giving me a lot of education, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has also greatly educated me. In the winter of 1950, our entire crew signed up to join the army in order to support the Korean front. Later, due to the needs of work, the superiors did not approve our request, so we worked hard to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state in our own positions. At that time, we proposed to support the Korean people with the slogan of saving materials and safe driving without accidents. At that time, we could save 30 tons of coal and half of the material costs every month. In the past three years, we have won more than 30 pennants for saving materials and safe driving. All nine members of our crew have been rated as model backbone members. From 1949 to now, we have safely traveled 510,000 kilometers.
    In order to continue to support the peaceful construction of the Korean people, our crew has now responded to the motherland's new call for increasing production and practicing economy, and guarantees to save 36 tons of coal and 30% of material costs in the fourth quarter of this year, and to ensure safe driving without accidents. Our entire crew requests Marshal Kim Il-sung to convey our determination to support Korean construction to the Korean people. We must support the Korean people as we support our own motherland. Let the people of our two countries always join hands and be vigilant against the conspiracy of American imperialism to undermine the armistice!

    我执行了一次光荣的任务
    迎接金日成元帅专车司机　刘仁  张芳
    十一月十一日夜晚，当上级告诉我明天要去天津接受一个光荣任务的时候，我的心情马上紧张起来。什么任务呀？突然我一下联想到，当天报纸上的头条新闻：金日成元帅率领的朝鲜政府代表团十日中午就从平壤出发了，十二日一定会到天津，这准是迎接他们去的吧！这一夜，我没有离开我的机车，我们亲自看守着它。我同副司机韩朝选同志、司炉李连生同志，把机车擦的干干净净，机车上有铜的部分，擦的都放出光来。
    十二号早晨六点半，满天大雾，我们从北京出发了。开车后，我才知道，果然是去迎接金日成元帅，我真是兴奋极了。金日成元帅从平壤安安全全到了天津，我这一路更要让他坐的舒舒服服才是。我一面开着车，一面耽心，老怕沿途站上误了点。
    在天津车站，我们三个人，又仔细地把机车检查了一遍，每个小地方都用检点锤敲过了，还是不大放心，我们又换上了十几块新的闸瓦，每处车轴都上足了油。一定要使这趟车开得稳稳当当，不让它发生任何一点故障。
    中午十二点零八分，差一分钟就开车了。在机车刚一开动的时候，怎么能使金日成元帅不觉得车子震动才好呵！我紧紧掌握着机车上开动的地方，车子平悠悠地开始滚动起来。司炉同志把煤火都调剂好了，他保证不使机车冒出黑烟。
    下午三点钟，我们到达北京车站了。月台上站满了人，他们一个劲地迎着机车鼓掌、掷花，不知为什么，我眼里含满了泪。乐队开始奏乐了，掌声也响起来，我想金日成元帅一定走到月台上了，我站在机车上向人群里张望，终于我看到了，几年来领导朝鲜人民打退美国侵略的就是他呵！金日成元帅戴着黑礼帽，穿着黑呢子大衣，又高又胖，他的身体多么健康呵！他同周总理并肩走着，彭德怀司令员穿着绿色军服，走在后面，后面还有许多国际友人。金日成元帅鼓着掌，缓慢地走着。我的手掌拍得都发烧了。
    当金日成元帅走出车站以后，我的心情经过兴奋和紧张以后觉得格外轻松起来，上级交给的这一光荣任务，我们已把它完成了。回头看了看跟随了我四年的机车，我想起了不少事情。从十六岁我就在铁路上工作，到现在已经八年了。在旧社会，我擦了四年车，没有人理会过我；解放后四年来，我由擦车、司炉到正司机，已升了五级。
    几年来，我能有这样的进步，除了党给了我不少教育外，抗美援朝运动也大大教育了我。一九五○年冬天，我们全包乘组为了支援朝鲜前线，都报名参军了。后来，由于工作的需要，上级没有批准我们的请求，我们就在自己的工作岗位上努力完成国家交给的任务。当时，我们曾提出，要以节省材料、安全行驶不出事故的口号，来支援朝鲜人民，那时我们每月可节省三十吨煤和一半材料费。三年来，我们在节省材料与安全行驶方面，获得三十多面锦旗，我们包乘组的九个人都被评为模范基干队员。从一九四九年到现在，我们已安全行驶了五十一万公里。
    为了继续支援朝鲜人民的和平建设，现在我们包乘组又响应了祖国新的增产节约的号召，保证要在今年第四季度，节省三十六吨煤，和百分之三十的材料费，保证安全行驶不出事故。我们全包乘组请求金日成元帅，把我们支援朝鲜建设的决心，带给朝鲜人民。我们一定要像支援我们自己的祖国一样，去支援朝鲜人民。让我们两国人民永远携起手来，警惕美帝国主义破坏停战的阴谋吧！
