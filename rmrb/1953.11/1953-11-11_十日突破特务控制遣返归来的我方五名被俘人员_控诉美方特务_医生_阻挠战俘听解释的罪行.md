Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Five more of our captured personnel returned this morning at 11:00 AM. Among these five captured personnel, two are mentally ill, but they are very clear on one point, and that is their firm desire to return to their motherland. Among them, Huang Libing, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, had one leg crippled by special agents and his face was abnormally pale. At the accusation meeting held in the Panmunjom armistice negotiation conference room, he could not understand the questions raised by foreign reporters, and only mumbled: "The special agents beat me... I want to go home!"

Another captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Miao Fulu, took off his clothes, exposing reactionary characters and the Kuomintang party emblem forcibly tattooed on his body, for the neutral country personnel and foreign reporters to see. He said with grief and indignation: "These were all forced on us with bayonets by the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek bandits!" He pointed to the American reporters present and said: "What are you doing standing here? Get out!" The American reporters showed an awkward wry smile.

Neutral Swiss personnel also participated in today's accusation meeting. They once described the reasonable explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side as "mental torture," but faced with the prisoners of war who had suffered two or three years of long-term persecution and torture in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, they showed indifferent expressions. They even quietly left before the prisoners of war had finished speaking.

When reporters asked the five returnees "Why did you risk your lives to escape without waiting to hear the explanations," Miao Fulu said: "No one believed that they could return home by listening to the explanations. The special agents had already said that anyone who expressed a willingness to return home at the explanation site would be beaten to death on the spot. The special agents organized five-person joint responsibility groups. If one person wanted to return home, the other four would be hung on barbed wire or beaten to death. I thought that applying for repatriation and escaping from the barbed wire were equally dangerous when listening to the explanations, so I decided to escape."

Another returnee from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Yu Hui, escaped from the "hospital" provided by the U.S. side. He revealed that the U.S. "doctors" threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "You are not well yet, you cannot go to listen to the explanations at all!" This proves that in order to forcibly detain the prisoners of war, the U.S. side did not hesitate to use all kinds of despicable means to obstruct the prisoners of war from listening to the explanations.

Today, the five captured personnel who returned, without explanation, risked breaking through the special agent control and demanded repatriation, which once again exposed the lie promoted by the United States that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war "would rather die than be repatriated."

    十日突破特务控制遣返归来的我方五名被俘人员
    控诉美方特务“医生”阻挠战俘听解释的罪行
    【新华社开城十日电】十日上午十一时，又有五名我方被俘人员归来。在这五个被俘人员中有两个是精神病患者，但有一点他们非常清醒，那就是坚决要求回祖国。其中，中国人民志愿军被俘人员黄立炳，一只腿被特务打成残废，面色也异常苍白。在板门店停战谈判会议室里举行的控诉会上，他听不懂各国记者所提出的问题，只是喃喃地说：“特务打了我……我要回家！”
    另一个中国人民志愿军被俘人员苗福禄脱下衣服，露出身上被强迫刺满的反动字样和国民党党徽，给中立国人员和各国记者看。他悲愤地说：“这都是美国人和蒋匪特务用刺刀逼着给我们刺上的啊！”他指着在场的美方记者说：“你们站在这里作什么？走开！”美方记者露出一阵尴尬的苦笑。
    中立国瑞士人员也参加了今天的控诉会。他们曾经把朝中方面合理的解释工作说成是“精神的折磨”，但面对着在美方战俘营遭受两三年长期的迫害折磨的战俘，却露出冷漠的表情。他们甚至不等到战俘讲完，便悄悄地走掉了。
    当记者问五名归来者“为什么不等到听取解释而要冒死逃出”时，苗福禄说：“谁也不相信听解释时能够回国，特务们早就说，谁在解释场所表示愿意回家就会被就地打死。特务们组织了五人连环保，有一个人愿意回家，其他四个人就将被挂在铁丝网上或被打死。我想听取解释时申请遣返和逃出铁丝网一样危险，就下决心逃出来。”
    另一名中国人民志愿军归来人员余辉如是从美方所提供的“医院”里逃出来的。他揭露说：美方“医生”恫吓战俘说：“你们病还没有好，根本不能去听解释！”这证明美方为了强迫扣留战俘，不惜采用种种卑鄙手段来阻挠战俘听取解释。
    今天归来的五个被俘人员，未经解释就冒险突破特务控制要求遣返，这再一次揭穿了美国宣传所谓朝中战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的谎言。
