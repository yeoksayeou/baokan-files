    Why Aren't We Allowed to Mass Produce Welding Rods
    —Letter from National Model Worker Li Jinquan
    Letter from Li Jinquan, national model worker and electric welder at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant: This year is the first year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres at all levels across the country are striving to increase production and practice economy, overcome difficulties, and prepare to victoriously and overfulfill this year's national construction plan. Our factory has also successively convened various meetings to mobilize all employees to find tricks, tap potential, and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy. As a Communist Party member, I have been nurtured and cared for by the Party for several years, and have also been educated at the National Congress of Labor Models for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. Needless to say, my heart has always been burning with enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy. I get up early and go to bed late, racking my brains, concerned about how to create more wealth for our working class's own country. Before this year's National Day, our welding team increased production by ten tons of mild steel welding rods in twenty days as a gift to the National Day. However, I deeply feel that my contribution to the country is too small; in fact, our team still has great potential, but it cannot be fully utilized.
    Since 1950, I have been diligently and painstakingly researching, and after 120 experimental failures, I finally created five types of welding rods: mild steel grade A, mild steel grade B, cast iron, medium carbon steel, and stainless steel. These welding rods have been tested by the Engineering Materials Testing Service Department attached to Tsinghua University, the Comprehensive Testing Institute of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, and identified by Soviet expert Yuvashya of the Northeast Fuxin Power Plant, proving that the quality is very good. Among them, the tensile stress of mild steel welding rods exceeds that of American Lincoln brand welding rods by 25%, and the cost per kilogram is 60,000 yuan cheaper than American products, and much cheaper than products from private factories. Last year alone, the 40 tons of mild steel welding rods produced by our team saved the country 2.4 billion yuan compared to imported goods. But I am not satisfied with this. I am still continuing to research and trial-produce high carbon steel, alloy steel, ductile iron, copper, and aluminum welding rods. Among them, high carbon steel welding rods have recently been successfully produced after more than 40 experimental setbacks.
    Here I must mention in passing the environment in which I conduct research and trial production.
    Research and trial production of welding rods require relatively advanced scientific knowledge and relatively skilled technology. But my education level is very low (elementary school), and our team's technical conditions are poor (the highest is a seventh-grade worker). There are no reference books. When researching, because I don't understand chemical analysis and lack equipment, I have to rely on my tongue to identify the properties of various medicines. I often use the intervals between sleep and rest to conduct research. When trial-producing high carbon steel welding rods, steel wire is needed (this kind of steel wire is produced by the Tianjin Steel Plant). The budget was made at the beginning of the year, but the supply section only bought it in July. A few pounds of silicic acid are needed, and I have to ride my bicycle to the city late at night to buy it myself. Many research projects are often interrupted because the raw materials are not available. Whenever I encounter these difficulties, I have also been discouraged. Sometimes I am so distressed that I want to smash all the bottles and jars containing medicines and raw materials. But when I look up and see dozens of letters from the volunteer army neatly pasted on the wall, I scold myself: "Would the volunteer soldiers guarding Korea throw down their guns and stop fighting just because there are more enemies coming? You are just bowing your head to difficulties!"
    However, I have opinions about the fact that the products that have been successfully trial-produced cannot be fully produced and that the team's potential cannot be fully realized. Stainless steel welding rods have not been produced even once in the year since they were successfully trial-produced on July 12 last year. The production volume of cast iron and medium carbon steel welding rods is also very small. Our team's production capacity can manufacture 198 tons of welding rods a year, but this year the factory's task for us is to produce 40 tons of welding rods for the whole year. That is to say, in addition to completing the factory's production tasks, our team can actually produce 158 tons more welding rods to supply the needs of industrial and national defense construction throughout the country. But our factory has not made good use of the potential of our team. Now all the employees in the factory are enthusiastically formulating work plans and increasing production targets, but our team is the only one without an increased production task. In the first half of this year, our team stopped working for three or four months because of "overproduction"; now, if this problem is not solved, in the high tide of the national production increase and economy drive, we will have to put down our production tools with heartache again.
    Is the reason why our factory does not support us to continue trial production and mass production of welding rods because there is no need for it in production? Yes, according to the current production situation in the factory, there is no need for it. But if the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant does not need it, other factories across the country need it, and the construction of the entire country needs it; among them, high carbon steel, medium carbon steel, and stainless steel welding rods are important supplies in the national defense industry. In modern industrial construction, many metal structures are in urgent need of electric welding; replacing rivet work with excellent electric welding is exactly what modern engineering needs to strive for. The fact is also true. According to the survey report of our factory's finished product sales section, the welding rods produced by our factory are of good quality and low price, and many factories compete to order them, precisely because the factory lacks goods and cannot meet the needs of purchasing units.
    In order to solve the problem of our factory's self-made welding rods being promoted externally so that our team can mass produce, I wrote a proposal on April 18 this year and handed it to Deputy Director An Chaojun. But this proposal is still being kicked around like a ball among three factory directors, two chief mechanical room directors, and five repair department directors. I hope that the higher-level leading organs can help me solve this problem, so that I and our team can unleash our potential and contribute welding technology to the country's industrial and national defense construction.
    Editor's note: We have investigated the problems reflected in Comrade Li Jinquan's letter. The situation described by Comrade Li Jinquan is basically consistent with the facts. In the past, the vast majority of welding rods needed by our country's factories, mines, and capital construction departments relied on imports from foreign countries. In recent years, although some state-owned factories in Northeast China and some private manufacturers in Shanghai have been able to manufacture in relatively large quantities, many special welding rods (such as stainless steel welding rods) still have to be supplied by imports. Comrade Li Jinquan's successful trial production of various high-quality and low-cost welding rods could and should have solved the problem of the lack of excellent welding rods for our country's factories, national defense industry, and capital construction departments. However, due to the lack of active support and assistance from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and relevant leading organs, on the one hand, the inventions and creations and production potential of advanced producers cannot be fully utilized, and on the other hand, some industrial and mining enterprises cannot buy satisfactory welding rods with money, which affects production. For example, in August this year, the Tianjin Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation ordered 100 tons of stainless steel welding rods from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, but was politely rejected because the factory had no goods; recently, a unit under the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government ordered 80 tons of mild steel grade A welding rods from the factory, but could not be supplied for the same reason.
    Since the production of welding rods is currently needed, and there is a bright future for development in the near future, and the welding rods produced by Li Jinquan's team are of good quality and low cost, therefore, starting from the needs of the entire national construction cause, we suggest that the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau should first consider how to fully utilize their potential strength under the existing equipment and conditions. With the development of the national construction cause, at an appropriate time, it should further consider expanding and developing the production equipment and capacity of this welding rod team according to needs and possibilities, so that it can better serve the country's industrial construction and national defense construction.

    为什么不让我们大量生产电焊条
    ——全国工业劳动模范李金泉来信
    全国工业劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂电焊工人李金泉来信：今年是祖国第一个五年计划的头一个年度，全国广大的工人、农民和各级干部都在努力增产节约，克服困难，准备胜利地、超额地完成今年国家的建设计划。我们厂也已先后召开了各种会议，发动全厂职工找窍门、挖潜力，制订增产节约计划。我是个共产党员，几年来受着党的培养和爱护，还曾经在全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议上受过教育。对于增产节约，用不着说，我的心一直是热呼呼的。我起早睡晚，用尽心思，惦记着的是：怎样更好地给咱们工人阶级自己的国家创造更多的财富。今年国庆节前夕，我们这个电焊小组在二十天里增产十吨软钢电焊条，作为献给国庆节的礼物。但是，我深深地感到自己对国家贡献太小；实际上，我们小组还有很大的潜力，却得不到充分的发挥。
    从一九五零年以来，我孜孜不倦地苦心钻研，最后经过一百二十几次试验上的失败，终于连续创制了软钢甲种、软钢乙种、生铁、中炭钢和不锈钢等五种电焊条。这些电焊条先后经过清华大学附设工程材料试验服务部、中央重工业部综合试验所的试验和东北阜新发电厂苏联专家尤瓦夏的鉴定，证明质量很好。其中软钢电焊条的抗拉应力超过美国林肯牌焊条百分之二十五，成本每公斤比美国货便宜六万元，比私营工厂的产品也便宜得多。仅去年我们小组生产的四十吨软钢电焊条，比起进口货来就为国家节约了二十四亿元。但我并不以此为满足，我还在继续研究试制高炭钢、合金钢、球墨铸铁、铜和铝等电焊条。其中高炭钢电焊条在经过四十几次试验上的挫折以后，最近也成功了。
    这里我不得不顺便提一下我是在什么样的环境下来进行研究和试制的。
    研究和试制电焊条需要较高深的科学知识和较熟练的技术。可是我的文化程度很低（小学），我们小组的技术条件较差（最高的是七级工）。要参考书，没有。在研究时因为不懂化学分析和缺乏设备，我不得不靠舌头去鉴别各种药品的性能。我经常是利用睡眠和休息的间隙进行研究的。在试制高炭钢电焊条时需要钢丝（这种钢丝天津钢厂就出产），年初做了预算，供应科到七月份才给买来。需要几磅圭酸，也得自己黑天半夜骑自行车到城里买。许多研究工作经常因为原料无着落而中断。每当遇到这些困难时，我也曾经泄气过，有时苦恼得要把所有装药品原料的瓶瓶罐罐都摔掉。但一抬头瞧见墙上贴得整整齐齐的几十封志愿军的来信，我就责备自己：“守卫在朝鲜的志愿军难道曾经因为敌人来多了就扔下枪不打吗？你这不就叫向困难低头！”
    可是对于已经试制成功的产品不能充分生产和小组有潜力不能发挥这一点，我是有意见的。不锈钢电焊条自去年七月十二日试制成功后，一年来没有生产过一根。生铁、中炭钢两种电焊条生产量也很小。我们小组的生产能力一年可以制造一百九十八吨电焊条，但今年厂里给我们的任务是全年生产四十吨电焊条。就是说我们小组的实际生产能力除了完成厂里的生产任务以外，还可以多生产一百五十八吨电焊条，以供给全国各地的工业建设和国防建设的需要。但我们厂并没有很好发挥我们小组的这些潜力。现在全厂的职工都热情高涨地在制订作业计划和增产指标，唯独我们这个小组没有增产任务。今年上半年我们小组曾经因为“生产过剩”而停工三、四个月；现在再不解决这个问题，在全国滚腾的增产节约竞赛高潮中，我们眼看又得心如刀绞地放下生产工具。
    我们厂所以不支持我们继续试制和大量生产电焊条，是不是因为生产上不需要呢？是的，按照目前厂里生产的情况是不需要的。但是石景山钢铁厂不需要，全国其他工厂需要，整个国家的建设需要；其中高炭钢、中炭钢、不锈钢三种电焊条，更是国防工业中的重要用品。在现代化的工业建设中，许多金属结构正迫切需要电焊接；以优良的电焊接代替铆钉工作，这正是现代化工程所需要努力争取的。事实也正是这样，根据我厂成品销售科的调查报告，我厂出品的电焊条，质量好，价钱便宜，很多工厂争来订购，就是因为厂里缺货满足不了购买单位的需要。
    为了解决我厂自制的电焊条向外推销以便我们小组大量生产的问题，我在今年四月十八日曾经写了一个建议书交给安朝俊副厂长。但这个建议书到现在还在三个厂长、两个总机械室主任和五个修理部部主任之间像皮球般踢来踢去。我希望上级领导机关能够帮助我解决这个问题，好让我和我们小组发挥潜力，把电焊技术贡献给祖国的工业建设和国防建设。
    编者按：对于李金泉同志这封信所反映的问题，我们曾作了调查。李金泉同志所说的情况基本上是符合事实的。我国各工厂、矿山和基本建设部门所需的电焊条，过去绝大部分是依赖外货进口。近年来东北部分国营工厂和上海某些私营厂商虽能较大量地制造，但许多特种电焊条（例如不锈钢电焊条等）仍然要靠进口货供给。李金泉同志试造多种质优价廉的电焊条成功，本来可以而且应该为我国各工厂、国防工业和基本建设部门解决缺少优良的电焊条的问题。但是，由于石景山钢铁厂及有关领导机关没有积极加以支持和扶植，以致一方面是先进生产者的发明创造和生产潜力得不到充分的发挥，另一方面是某些工矿企业拿着钱买不到得心应手的电焊条而影响了生产。例如今年八月间中国五金机械公司天津市公司曾经向石景山钢铁厂订购不锈钢电焊条一百吨，因为该厂无货，被婉言谢绝；最近中央人民政府铁道部所属某单位向该厂订购软钢甲种电焊条八十吨，也因同样原因无法供应。
    电焊条的生产在目前既然是需要的，不久的将来还有其远大的发展前途，而李金泉小组所生产的电焊条又是质量好、成本低，因此，从整个国家建设事业的需要出发，我们建议钢铁工业局应该首先考虑如何在现有设备和条件下，充分地发挥他们的潜在力量。随着国家建设事业的发展，在适当时机则应进一步根据需要和可能，考虑扩大和发展这个电焊条小组的生产设备和能力，使它更好地为国家的工业建设和国防建设服务。
