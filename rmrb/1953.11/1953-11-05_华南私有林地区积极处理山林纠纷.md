South China's private forest areas are actively handling mountain forest disputes to further implement production policies and stabilize rural production order and the production morale of farmers.

The forest areas in South China are mainly artificial forest areas, and private forests are very developed. After the completion of land reform, the most obstructive problem to production was the issue of mountain forest disputes. The occurrence of these disputes was mainly due to the fact that the mountain forests that should have been distributed were not, and the distribution work that had been done was also crude, resulting in farmers randomly felling trees, fighting over mountain forests, firewood, and afforestation land. Bad elements took the opportunity to provoke disputes, causing instability in rural order and affecting farmers' enthusiasm for production. In order to solve this problem in a timely manner, the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee South China Sub-bureau put forward opinions and methods for handling it in July of this year and conducted a typical experiment in solving mountain forest disputes in Guilin Prefecture, Guangxi. It is preparing to allocate a certain amount of time in the autumn and winter seasons this year, according to the different conditions in various places, to mobilize the masses to solve this problem. The CPC Guangdong Provincial Yuebei District Committee issued instructions in mid-September on handling mountain forest disputes to stabilize production morale, requiring all counties to concentrate their efforts before the autumn harvest to carry out this work. It is necessary to抽调机关干部机关干部possible to transfer office cadres, led by responsible cadres, to go to the countryside, and in advance, they should study the relevant instructions of the CPC Central Committee South Central Bureau, South China Sub-bureau, and Yuebei District Party Committee. The counties followed the instructions of the District Party Committee and successively convened enlarged cadre meetings to specifically deploy this work. The Qujiang County enlarged cadre meeting decided to organize more than 200 cadres to go to the countryside to solve the more serious mountain forest problems in 28 townships in early October, and then convene a district representative meeting to summarize experience, and then spread out to the second batch of townships, requiring that this work be basically completed before October 25, and then move on to the autumn harvest and winter farming preparation work. The Nanxiong County District Committee Secretaries' Joint Meeting on September 24 also decided to send 40 office cadres to the countryside to handle mountain forest issues. The Yingde County held an enlarged cadre meeting on September 23, emphasizing that efforts should be concentrated in October to distribute the mountain forests that should be distributed but have not yet been distributed, and in the areas that have been distributed, property rights should be determined to eliminate disputes. The Yuebei District Party Committee also sent inspection teams to assist Yingde, Qingyuan, and other counties in their work.

    华南私有林地区积极处理山林纠纷
    华南私有林地区正积极处理山林纠纷，以进一步贯彻生产政策，安定农村生产秩序和农民的生产情绪。
    华南一带的林区主要是人工林区，私有林很发达。土地改革完成以后，遗留下来的问题中最妨碍生产的就是山林纠纷问题。这些纠纷的发生，主要是应分的山林没有分配下去，已分的分配工作也做得粗糙，致使农民乱伐林木，互相争山林、争柴草、争造林地，坏分子又乘机挑拨，引起农村秩序不安定，影响农民生产积极性。为了及时解决这一问题，中共中央华南分局农村工作部在今年七月即提出处理意见和办法，并在广西桂林专区进行解决山林纠纷的典型试验，准备在今年秋冬两季，按各地不同情况，划出一定时间，发动群众来解决这一问题。中共广东省粤北区委员会于九月中旬发出了关于处理山林纠纷安定生产情绪的指示，要求各县在秋收前集中力量，进行这一工作，尽可能抽调机关干部，由负责干部率领下乡，事前并应学习中共中央中南局、华南分局和粤北区党委的有关指示。各县遵照区党委的指示，相继召开了扩大干部会议，具体布置这一工作。曲江县扩大干部会议决定组织干部二百多人下乡，于十月上旬解决二十八个乡比较严重的山林问题，然后召开区代表会议总结经验，再向第二批乡铺开，要求在十月二十五日以前基本完成这一工作，转入秋收和冬耕准备工作。南雄县于九月二十四日区委书记联席会议上也决定抽机关干部四十人下乡处理山林问题。英德县于九月二十三日召开扩大干部会议，特别强调要在十月份内集中力量分配应分而尚未分下去的山林，在已分配的地区则确定产权，消除纠纷。粤北区党委并派出检查组，协助英德、清远等县进行工作。
