    The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce Canteen Promotes Eating Coarse Grains, Which is Very Popular Among Comrades
    A letter from Yan Zhenling of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Commerce: Our agency's canteen used to only serve white flour and rice, and didn't serve coarse grains. Many comrades wanted to eat coarse grains to diversify their diet and had suggested it to the canteen manager multiple times, but it was never adopted. The reason was that the manager thought that eating coarse grains was only the request of a few comrades and was worried that if coarse grains were prepared, they wouldn't sell. In May of this year, the People's Daily published an article entitled "Excessively Improving the Precision of Rice and Flour Processing Wastes Grain and Reduces Nutritional Value." Some comrades took this article and suggested to the manager again that coarse grains should be mixed in. The manager reluctantly agreed to try it out. As a result, the steamed *sī gāo* (a type of corn cake) sold out in a short time, and some comrades who wanted to eat it couldn't even buy it. This fact began to change the manager's thinking. After that, *sī gāo* and *wō wō tóu* (corn bread) were prepared every few days. Recently, in order to meet everyone's needs and respond to the call to save grain, the canteen prepares coarse grains every day for comrades to choose from. According to surveys, many people eat a coarse grain meal every day. Because eating coarse grains not only diversifies the diet, but also has high nutritional value. Now the manager is beginning to pay attention to eating coarse grains; but how to make coarse grains taste better requires the efforts of the cooks.

### 北京市商业局机关食堂提倡吃粗粮很受同志们欢迎

    北京市商业局机关食堂提倡吃粗粮很受同志们欢迎
    北京市人民政府商业局晏振陵来信：我们机关食堂过去光吃白面、大米，不吃粗粮。许多同志愿意吃粗粮来调剂口味，曾多次向食堂管理员建议，但都没有被采纳。原因是管理员认为吃粗粮是个别同志的要求，怕预备了粗粮卖不出去。今年五月份人民日报登了“过分提高米面加工精度会浪费粮食和减低营养价值”的文章，有的同志拿了这篇文章又向管理员提出掺吃粗粮的建议，管理员这才勉强答应试办一下。结果是：蒸出的丝糕一会儿就卖光了，有些想吃的同志还没有买到。这件事实开始扭转了管理员的思想，以后隔一两天就预备些丝糕、窝窝头。最近食堂为了满足大家的要求和响应节约粮食的号召，每天都准备了粗粮供同志们选吃。据调查，很多人每天必吃一顿粗粮。因为掺吃粗粮不但可以调剂口味，而且粗粮的营养价值也高。现在管理员对吃粗粮是开始重视了；但如何把粗粮做得更好吃一些，则需要依靠炊事员同志的努力。
