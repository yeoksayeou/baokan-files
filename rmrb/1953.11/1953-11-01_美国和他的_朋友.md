The United States and its "Friends"

	Graded Pricing

	According to a report by New York *Herald Tribune* reporter Dale in late October, Eisenhower is now considering a new "foreign aid" appropriation plan. This so-called "foreign aid" fund is specifically intended as capital for the United States to buy "military power" (cannon fodder) from its vassal states. To get this new plan approved by Congress, Eisenhower particularly emphasized that under this plan, the United States can achieve the greatest gains at the smallest cost, truly a good deal. Let's look at the detailed account that Dale calculated for Eisenhower: Maintaining a division of American troops costs $250 million a year, while a division of French troops only costs $80 million, a division of Turkish troops only costs $75 million, a division of South Korean troops only costs $15 million, and a division of the Kuomintang remnant bandits' troops only costs $5 million!

	Intrigue

	According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on October 15, Britain is planning to propose the formation of a so-called Southeast Asia "defense" organization. This organization would initially consist of several Commonwealth countries, and then invite the United States, France, and Japan to participate.

	But after this news was revealed, the US government expressed great indifference. Why is the United States, which has always clamored for the organization of a Pacific aggressive bloc, now indifferent to an organization of the same nature? Because as early as 1951, the United States bypassed Britain and pulled the Commonwealth countries of Australia and New Zealand over to sign the ANZUS Treaty as a component of the Pacific aggressive bloc. The so-called Southeast Asia "defense" organization that Britain is now planning to propose is intended to replace the ANZUS Treaty from which it is excluded, so it is no wonder that the United States is so indifferent.

	Whom to Arm

	Recently, Japanese public opinion has been expressing increasing dissatisfaction with the US's stepped-up arming of Japan. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* published an editorial on October 18 stating that the United States is "more concerned" about Japan's "establishment of national defense" than the Japanese government itself, and the Japanese "people are wondering, for whom is the self-defense force that the Yoshida government is now talking about?"

	The question suspected by *Mainichi Shimbun* was answered as early as October 1 by a Japanese political commentator, Tatsuo Mitarai, in another bourgeois newspaper, *Yomiuri Shimbun*. He said, "Frankly speaking, the United States is trying to use Japanese and South Korean soldiers as mercenaries to defend the United States itself!"

	Cynicism and Scorn

	In early October, William Connor, a columnist for the British *Daily Mirror* who was traveling in the United States, wrote an article in the *Daily Mirror* under the pen name Cassandra. After denouncing Eisenhower's昏愦无能 (昏愦无能: muddle-headed incompetence), he wrote about Eisenhower's recent statement on atomic weapons, saying, "From the most authoritative people in his department, there have been many contradictory and foolish statements about the Soviet Union and the hydrogen bomb, making Eisenhower's government seem like a headless duck." Finally, Connor gave this American president a conclusion, saying: Eisenhower "so far can be ranked with Harding and Coolidge as the most disastrous presidents in American history."

	Disregard

	According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Copenhagen on October 21, the US government suddenly lodged a "protest" with Denmark, on the grounds that Denmark had accepted a batch of ships ordered by the Soviet Union, and the "Tupolev" steamer, which is now about to be completed, is about to be delivered to the Soviet Union. The United States was therefore furious, saying that countries that accept US military and economic "aid" cannot transport strategic materials to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. However, the Danish government ignored this American "protest." Because the United States's little "aid" is too great a loss for Denmark. Denmark would rather not have US "aid" and have free trade. According to the same news, Denmark has five more refrigerated ships for transporting fish under construction, and they will be shipped to the Soviet Union one after another.

### 美国和他的“朋友”

　　美国和他的“朋友”
    分等论价
    据十月下旬纽约《先驱论坛报》记者戴尔透露，艾森豪威尔现在正考虑一个新的“援外”拨款计划。这笔所谓“援外”的款项，是专门作为美国向它的仆从国家收买“军事力量”（炮灰）的资本。为了使这个新的计划获得国会的批准，艾森豪威尔特别强调：根据这个计划美国可以用最小的代价取得最大的收获，真是一桩好买卖。请看戴尔为艾森豪威尔算的细帐吧：维持一个师的美国军队，一年的费用是二亿五千万美元，而一师法国军队只需八千万美元，一师土耳其军队只需七千五百万美元，一师南朝鲜军队只需一千五百万美元，至于一师国民党残匪的军队，只要五百万美元！
    钩心斗角
    据路透社华盛顿十月十五日的电讯报道：英国正打算建议组成一个所谓东南亚“防御”组织。这个组织首先由英联邦的若干国家组成，然后再叫美国、法国和日本参加。
    但这一消息透露出去以后，美国政府表示十分冷淡。为什么一向叫嚷组织太平洋侵略集团的美国，现在对同样性质的组织冷淡起来了呢？因为远在一九五一年，美国就撇开了英国，而把英联邦的国家澳大利亚和新西兰拉过去，签订了一个美澳新公约，作为太平洋侵略集团的一个组成部分。而英国现在打算建议组织的所谓东南亚“防御”组织，就是想来代替它被排斥在外的美澳新公约的，难怪美国要十分冷淡了。
    为谁武装
    近来，日本舆论对美国加紧武装日本问题，流露出越来越多的不满。日本资产阶级报纸《每日新闻》在十月十八日发表社论说：美国对日本的“建立国防”问题，比日本的政府“还要关心”，日本“人民在奇怪，吉田政府现在所谈的自卫力量究竟是为了谁？”
    《每日新闻》所怀疑的这个问题，早在十月一日就由一个日本政治评论家御手洗辰夫在另一个资产阶级报纸《读卖新闻》上回答过了。他说：“坦白地说，美国企图把日本和南朝鲜的兵士当做雇佣军，用来保卫美国自己！”
    冷嘲热骂
    十月上旬，一个正在美国游历的英国《每日镜报》专栏作家威廉·康诺，曾以卡山德拉的笔名，在《每日镜报》上写了一篇文章，他在痛骂艾森豪威尔的昏愦无能之后，说到艾森豪威尔最近关于原子武器的声明时，写道：“从他所辖部门的最权威人士起，有不少关于苏联和氢弹的矛盾百出的愚蠢的声明，使人觉得艾森豪威尔的政府简直像个无头的鸭子。”最后，康诺还给这个美国总统作了一个结论，他说：艾森豪威尔“到目前为止可以与哈定和柯立芝同列为美国为祸最烈的总统”。
    置之不理
    据法新社哥本哈根十月二十一日消息称：美国政府忽然向丹麦提出了“抗议”，理由是丹麦接受苏联订购的一批船，现在即将完成的“吐泼斯号”汽船，就要向苏联交货了。美国因此大怒，说是凡接受美国军事和经济“援助”的国家，都不能向苏联和人民民主国家运送战略物资。然而，丹麦政府并没有理会美国这个“抗议”。因为美国的那一点点“援助”对于丹麦的损失太大了。丹麦宁愿不要美国的“援助”，而要贸易自由。据同一消息说，丹麦还有五艘供运鱼用的冷藏船正在建造，并将陆续运往苏联。
