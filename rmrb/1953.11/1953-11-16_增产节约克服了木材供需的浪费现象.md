　　Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Overcome the Waste of Timber Supply and Demand

　　Based on the actual use of timber, the proportion of planks with a thickness of 45 mm or more should not exceed 20% of the total number of planks. However, in the Northeast region in the first half of this year, the actual allocation of such planks accounted for 38.94% of the total number of planks. Square timber with a cross-sectional width-thickness product of 9 to 108 square centimeters, and square timber suitable for making house frames and beams from 109 to 216 square centimeters, should account for more than 90% of the total number of square timber; however, the actual allocated quantity only accounted for 30.27% of the total number of square timber, while semi-finished special large square timber with width and thickness unsuitable for actual needs accounted for 69.73% of the total number of square timber. The above figures show that there are phenomena of "using long timber for short purposes," "using large timber for small purposes," and "using superior timber for inferior purposes" in many cases. This is contrary to the spirit of the State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on saving timber on August 13, 1951. For example, in May of this year, the Harbin Basic Construction Materials Company's lumber mill used red pine logs eight meters long to saw barrel boards for pickles for the Native Produce Company. Other industrial departments also mostly use special large square timber or long planks when packaging matches, soap, rubber shoes, cigarettes, beer, medicine, and machinery. Some units even cut gray strips from special large square timber, causing extremely painful and huge losses to the state. The reason for this waste of large timber for small purposes is mainly due to the disconnect between timber supply and demand and the disconnect between designers and material receiving personnel. For example, although state-owned lumber mills produce a large number of high-quality box boards and gray strips, the material-demanding units often do not know about it and plan to modify such materials themselves with large timber; when designers calculate the timber required, they all use long and large timber as the standard, such as when calculating planks, they uniformly use four-meter-long or six-meter-long and thirty-centimeter-wide as the calculation unit. When square timber of the same specifications is required, they do not calculate separately according to different lengths, but mostly summarize the two-meter-long, two-and-a-half-meter-long, and three-meter-long timber into four-meter, five-meter, or six-meter-long timber according to the multiple of the timber. In terms of quality, they do not indicate the grade according to each type of timber based on actual needs, but mostly uniformly indicate as first and second-grade timber. Because order forms are uniformly written as first and second-grade timber. According to the timber production situation, it is often impossible to allocate all first and second-grade timber, but to allocate according to the ratio of first, second, and third-grade timber stipulated by the state's timber allocation regulations. Therefore, the parts that should use first-grade timber actually receive first, second, and third-grade timber; and the parts that should use third-grade timber are allocated first, second, and third-grade timber.
　　The increase production and practice economy campaign has begun to resolve the contradiction between timber supply and demand. Because all departments are tapping potential and finding ways to formulate production increase and economy plans, they have begun to calculate the details in this regard. The 25th Factory of the Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau took the initiative to sign a box board contract with the Shenyang Brewery. In the past, the brewery was allocated logs by the state and then found a factory to process the box boards. The cost of each box was about 15,000 yuan; now, the 25th Factory supplies ready-made box boards, and the cost of each box is only 4,000 yuan, so the factory can save 200 to 300 million yuan per month. The 25th Lumber Factory also processed the long-term unsalable short boards with 590,000 yuan per cubic meter into ready-made box boards, and the price per cubic meter increased to 789,000 yuan. In addition to increasing income, it also accelerated the factory's capital turnover. This practice of mutual benefit and win-win between supply and demand, and saving a large amount of funds for the country, will be widely developed and active with the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

　　增产节约克服了木材供需的浪费现象
    王凤翥
    根据木材实际使用情况，厚度在四十五公厘以上的板材，在整个板材数中占的比例，最多也不应该超过百分之二十。但东北区今年上半年此类板材的实际拨付数字，却占板材总数量的百分之三十八点九四。横断面宽厚相乘积由九平方公分到一○八平方公分的方材，和适于制做房架房梁由一○九到二一六平方公分的方材，本应占方材总数量的百分之九十以上；但实际拨付数量，仅占方材总数量百分之三十点二七，而宽厚不适于实际需要的半成品性质的特大方材，却占方材总数量的百分之六十九点七三。以上这些数字说明了：在许多场合都存在着“长材短用”“大材小用”和“优材劣用”的现象。这是和一九五一年八月十三日中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材指示的精神背道而驰的。如今年五月份，哈尔滨市基本建设材料公司制材厂，给土产公司加工酱菜桶的桶板，是用八公尺长的红松原木锯断的。其他工业部门，在包装火柴、肥皂、胶鞋、纸烟、啤酒、药品及机器时，也大都用特大方材或长大板材，甚至还有的单位，用特大方材割灰条子。给国家造成了极为痛心的巨大损失。发生这种大材小用的原因，主要是由于木材供需双方的脱节及设计人员与领材人员的脱节而产生。譬如各国营制材厂，尽管生产大量的材质良好的箱子板及灰条子，但各需材单位，却往往不知道，竟计划自己用大材改制此类材料；设计人员计算所需木料时，都是以长材大材为标准的，比如算板材时，一律是以四公尺长或六公尺长三十公分宽为计算单位，对需用同样规格的方材时，不是按不同的长度分别加以计算，多半是把二公尺长的、二点五公尺长的、三公尺长的，按材的倍数，归纳为四公尺、五公尺或六公尺的长材。在质量上，也不是根据实际需要，按照各个材种注明等级，多半是一律注明为一、二等材，因订货单一律写为一、二等材。根据木材生产情况，常无法全部调给一、二等材，而按国家拨材规定的一、二、三等材比例进行拨付。因此在需要方面理应使用一等材，结果拨来了一、二、三等材；也有理应使用三等材的部分，反拨给了一、二、三等材。
    增产节约竞赛把木材供需双方的矛盾开始解决了。由于各部门挖潜力找窍门制订增产节约计划，已经开始计算这一方面的细账。东北制材工业局二十五厂，主动地与沈阳啤酒厂，签订了箱子板合同。过去啤酒厂是由国家调拨原木，再找工厂加工箱子板，每个箱子的成本，约为一万五千元左右；现在由二十五厂供应现成的箱子板，每个箱子的成本，仅为四千元，因之该厂每月可节约二、三亿元。二十五制材厂，也把长期滞销的每立方公尺五十九万元的短板，加工为现成的箱子板后，每立方公尺价格，提高到七十八万九千元，除增加了收入之外，并加速了该厂的资金周转。这种供需双方互利互惠，并为国家节省大批资金的做法，将随着增产节约竞赛的开展，广泛地发展与活跃起来。
