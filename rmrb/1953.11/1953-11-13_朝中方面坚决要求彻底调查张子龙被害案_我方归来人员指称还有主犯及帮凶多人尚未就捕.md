Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 11th:

Regarding the shocking murder of Zhang Zilong, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who insisted on repatriation, in the Dongchang-ri POW camp, where he was brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents who ripped out his heart, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's Indian Custodial Forces conducted a preliminary investigation on November 2nd, arresting seven perpetrators and establishing the basic facts of the case. However, according to reports from POWs who have successively returned to our side after breaking through the control of secret agents following this investigation, the masterminds and those who directly participated in this murder have not all been brought to justice. For example, the masterminds and accomplices who cruelly murdered Zhang Zilong, including secret agents who carried out hanging, burning, cutting flesh, nailing, cutting ears, disemboweling, ripping out the heart, ripping out the liver, and cutting the buttocks, in addition to the seven perpetrators already arrested, still include former "First Company Commander" Wei (surname), "Education Committee Member of the Third Company" Deng Yukuan, and "Tenth Squad Leader" Liu Liu, among others; secret agents who boiled the heart and liver, ate the heart and liver, and forced POWs to eat the heart and liver after cruelly murdering Zhang Zilong, in addition to the seven perpetrators already arrested, include former "Deputy Squad Leader of the Third Platoon of the Guard Unit" Leng Weiqing, and "Eleventh Squad Leader" Yang (surname), among others; the masterminds and accomplices who carried out acts of concealment such as burying the body, moving the body, and burning the body, in addition to the seven perpetrators already arrested, also include former "Battalion Headquarters Secretary" Zhang Decheng, "Ninth Squad Leader" Yang Zhida, and the "Eighth Squad Leader," among others. These secret agents have not yet been arrested.

Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war revealed that the masterminds behind this murder were Wang Futian of the 24th camp and Zhang Zunxian of the 25th camp. After the arrested perpetrators burned the body to destroy the evidence, they reported to Wang Futian through Zhou Yucheng, the "Battalion Commander" of the 27th camp, that they had "completed the task." Before executing the murder, the arrested secret agent Zhang Yuwang wrote to Zhang Zunxian on September 26, 1953, seeking instructions, stating: "During the parade on September 25th, soldier Zhang Zilong did not sing or shout slogans, which clearly indicates communist ideology and he cannot be educated and reformed. I am prepared to beat him to death or bury him alive to avoid returning to the mainland during future investigations. What do you think?" Zhang Zunxian wrote to Zhang Yuwang on September 29th, stating: "If anyone makes trouble during the parade in the battalion, break his legs. You previously thought Zhang Zilong was crazy, but this is wrong. In fact, there are many people like Zhang who want to return to the mainland, and it's definitely not just him. We must pay special attention to these people and not relax in the slightest... Teacher Ma mentioned at the Jeju Island Battalion Commander meeting that no unit is allowed to let a single person escape. We all made guarantees in front of him. We must notify the guards to be vigilant and pay attention to those who want to return to the mainland.” However, to date, Wang Futian and Zhang Zunxian are still at large, and the Chiang Kai-shek secret agent referred to as "Teacher Ma" in the above letter is still conducting secret agent activities in the Dongchang-ri POW hospital under the name of "administrative personnel" provided by the US side.

Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war also reported that on November 1st, before the Indian Custodial Forces conducted the first on-site investigation of this murder, the secret agents had already received news that an investigation was about to take place. On October 29th, they dug up the corpse originally buried under the tent, dismembered it, and then burned it in the kitchen. However, if the original burial site is excavated to a sufficient depth, traces of the burial can still be found. If the place where the corpse was burned is carefully examined, traces of burning can also be found.

The Korean-Chinese side firmly believes that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces must conduct a thorough investigation of the Zhang Zilong case. It is unacceptable to tolerate the masterminds and accomplices who inflict torture, murder, and even cannibalism remaining at large. The clues of those who tipped off the secret agents before the investigation should also be thoroughly investigated to clarify responsibility. The Korean-Chinese side has submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it is willing to provide all relevant witnesses to facilitate the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces in conducting further investigations quickly.

    朝中方面坚决要求彻底调查张子龙被害案
    我方归来人员指称还有主犯及帮凶多人尚未就捕
    【新华社开城十二日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团十一日发表公报如下：
    关于坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙在东场里战俘营惨遭蒋匪特务挖心杀害的骇人听闻的凶案，中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队在十一月二日进行了初步调查，逮捕了七名凶犯，初步确立了案情。但根据此次调查后突破特务控制陆续回至我方的战俘的报告，主谋与直接参加此项凶案的特务仍未全部落网。例如，惨杀张子龙的主犯与帮凶包括进行吊打、火烧、割肉、钉钉子、割耳朵、剖腹、挖心、挖肝、割臀等野蛮行为的特务除已逮捕的七名凶犯外，尚有原“一中队长”魏某、“三中队教育委员”邓玉宽、“十小队长”刘六等人；惨杀张子龙后煮心肝、吃心肝并强迫战俘吃心肝的特务除已逮捕的七名凶犯外，并有原“警备队三班副班长”冷维清、“十一小队长”杨某等人；进行埋尸、移尸、烧尸等灭迹行为的主犯与帮凶除已逮捕的七名凶犯外，还有原“大队部书记”张德成、“九小队长”杨志达、“八小队长”等人，这些特务迄今均尚未逮捕。
    归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员揭露了主谋此次凶案的特务第二十四号营场的王福田与第二十五号营场的张遵贤。已逮捕的凶犯在烧尸灭迹后，曾通过第二十七号营场“大队长”周玉成，向王福田报告“完成任务”。已被逮捕的特务张宇旺在执行凶案前，曾在一九五三年九月二十六日致函张遵贤请示，内称：“九月二十五日游行时，队员张子龙不唱歌、不呼口号，显然是共产党思想，不能教育改造。我准备把他打死或活埋，免得将来审查时回大陆，你以为如何？”张遵贤曾于九月二十九日致函张宇旺，内称：“如果有谁在大队里捣乱游行，就把谁的腿打断，你们以前认为张子龙是疯子，这是错误的。实际上，像张一样要回大陆的人很多，决不止一个，对这类人应特别注意，丝毫不能放松。……马老师在济州岛大队长会议上曾提出过，无论那一单位不准跑走一个人。我们也都曾在他面前下过保证。对那批想回大陆的人，必须通知警备时常严防注意”。但迄今为止，王福田与张遵贤均仍逍遥法外，而张遵贤在上述函中称为“马老师”的蒋匪特务，仍以美方所提供的“行政人员”的名义，在东场里战俘医院中进行特务活动。
    归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员并报告称：十一月一日，印度看管部队第一次对此次凶案进行现场调查前，特务分子即已获得调查即将进行的消息。他们于十月二十九日将原埋在帐篷下的尸首挖出分尸后，即在伙房中予以焚烧。但原埋葬地点如作足够深度的挖掘，仍能发现埋尸的痕迹。焚烧尸体之处如经仔细的检查，亦能发现烧尸的遗迹。
    朝中方面坚决认为：中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队对张子龙惨案必须予以彻底的调查。决不能容忍任施酷刑、杀人乃至于吃人的主犯及帮凶逍遥法外。调查进行前向特务分子通风报信的线索，亦应予以严密的调查，以明确责任。朝中方面已向中立国遣返委员会提出，愿提供一切有关人证，以便中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队迅速进行进一步的调查。
