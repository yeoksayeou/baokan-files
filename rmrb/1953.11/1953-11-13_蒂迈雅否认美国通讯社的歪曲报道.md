　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 11th: General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, stated to the press on the 10th that he denied reports by the United States Information Service and other American news agencies that quoted him as saying that explaining to prisoners of war for several hours in a row was "inhumane."

　　General Timayya said that these "incorrect statements," which were supposedly said by him, were merely a description of the "various reasons" he gave for the heads of Camp No. 22 not allowing prisoners of war to come out and listen to the explanations.

　　These so-called "reasons" show that Kuomintang secret agents under American command are again attempting to force the Indian custodial troops to accept their conditions before they agree to let the prisoners of war come out to listen to the explanations. These secret agents, like the Swiss commissioners, are demanding that the individual explanation time be greatly shortened, so that the fear in the prisoners of war's hearts cannot be eliminated. According to General Timayya, these secret agent leaders "are also very hostile to the Indian guards" because they "always forcibly held them in their seats inside the explanation camp" in order to prevent "prisoners of war" from attacking the explanation personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. These secret agent leaders are clearly trying to gain more freedom to insult and attack the explanation representatives and sabotage the explanation work.

　　The secret agent leaders in Camp No. 22 have prevented the prisoners of war in the camp from leaving the camp for four days in order to sabotage the explanation work and turn the explanation work into a farce.

    蒂迈雅否认美国通讯社的歪曲报道
    【新华社开城十一日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在十日向报界发表谈话时，否认美国新闻处和其他美国通讯社的报道，这些报道引用他的话说：向战俘接连解释几个小时“是不人道的”。
    蒂迈雅将军说：这些据说是他所说的“不正确的谈话”，只不过是他对第二十二号营场内的头子们不让战俘出来听取解释而提出的“各种理由”的叙述而已。
    这些所谓“理由”表明：美国指挥的国民党特务又在企图逼迫印度看管部队在他们答应让战俘出来听取解释以前接受他们的条件。这些特务和瑞士委员一样，要求把个别解释的时间大大缩短，这样，战俘心中的疑惧就不能够消除。据蒂迈雅将军说，这些特务头子“还对印度卫兵非常反感”，因为他们为了阻止“战俘”攻击朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的解释人员，“总是在解释营内把他们强捺在座位上”。这些特务头子显然企图获得更多的自由来侮辱和攻击解释代表，破坏解释工作。
    第二十二号营场内的特务头子们为了破坏解释工作和使解释工作变为滑稽剧，已经有四天不让该营场中的战俘走出营场了。
