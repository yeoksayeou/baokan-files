　　Wuhan University Teachers Combine Teaching with Scientific Research

　　Wuhan University teachers are implementing the spirit of the National Comprehensive University Conference by combining teaching duties with scientific research.

　　Currently, the scientific research work of Wuhan University teachers mainly involves studying Soviet textbooks. After a period of study, the teachers have realized the importance of learning from advanced Soviet science, technology, and teaching experience to reform teaching. To improve teaching quality and prepare for offering specialized and specialized courses in the future, many teachers are engaged in the study of Soviet textbooks. Some teachers in the Mathematical Analysis Teaching and Research Group of the Mathematics Department have chosen to delve into the "Higher Mathematics Tutorial" related to the current teaching, while others are studying "Complex Variable Function Theory" to prepare for next year's professional courses. Teachers in the General Physics Teaching and Research Group of the Physics Department plan to spend a longer time studying the Soviet textbook "General Physics." Dai Chunzhou, the head of the Physics Department, is concentrating on studying textbooks related to "Quantum Mechanics" this semester in preparation for teaching "Quantum Mechanics" next year. Teachers in the Political Economy Department are studying "Political Economy." Teachers in the Law Department have also begun to study Marxist-Leninist theories on the state and the rights. Most teachers are studying Soviet textbooks while simultaneously translating them and compiling lecture notes. They are also conducting research while writing or translating.

　　A few teaching and research groups and individual teachers at Wuhan University have also begun to conduct research on specific issues. The teachers in the Analytical Chemistry Teaching and Research Group of the Chemistry Department have accepted commissions from industrial departments and are engaged in analytical research on a smaller scale, such as industrial water, lime content, the calorific value of coal, and the composition of iron. Tang Changru, a teacher in the History Department, is researching Chinese medieval history. Li Jianong, an elderly professor in his seventies, has collected a large amount of ancient Chinese historical data, and an assistant and two graduate students are helping him with the task of organizing the data. The science departments are also preparing to hold various scientific seminars successively.

　　Beijing Normal University Fourth-Year Students Begin Second Educational Practice

　　More than 400 fourth-year students from various departments of Beijing Normal University in the 1953 academic year began their second educational practice on the 23rd. The requirements for this educational practice are that the interns cultivate the ability to work independently as middle school teachers through trial teaching in the classroom and working as class teachers, understand the process and effectiveness of ordinary middle schools and normal schools learning advanced Soviet experience, and the principles and tasks of local educational administrative organs; understand teaching plans, teaching content, and the school environment; master the principles and methods of classroom teaching; cultivate the ability to observe and analyze school teaching work; recognize the importance of educational work; and further consolidate their professional ideology of serving the people's education. This semester, 436 students from eleven departments, including education (school education and pre-school education), history, Chinese language and literature, Russian, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, music, and drawing and drafting, are participating in the internship. The internship period is five weeks.

    武汉大学教师结合教学业务展开科学研究工作
    武汉大学教师贯彻全国综合大学会议的精神，结合教学业务展开科学研究工作。
    目前，武汉大学教师的科学研究工作主要是研究苏联教材。教师们经过过去一个时期的学习，已认识到学习苏联先进科学技术和教学经验进行教学改革的重要性。为了提高教学质量和为将来开设专业与专门化课程作好准备，许多教师都投入了研究苏联教材的工作。数学系数学分析教研组一部分教师选择与本期教学有关的“高等数学教程”进行钻研，一部分教师为准备明年的专业课程，学习“复变函数论”。物理系普通物理教研组的教师准备用较长的时间学习苏联教材“普通物理学”。物理系主任戴春洲为准备明年讲授“量子力学”，这学期集中力量研究有关“量子力学”的教材。政治经济系的教师正研究“政治经济学”。法律系教师也开始研究马克思列宁主义关于国家与法权的理论。大多数教师一方面研究苏联教材，一方面翻译苏联教材和编写讲义。他们在编写或翻译的过程中也同时进行了研究工作。
    武汉大学还有个别教研组和个别教师已开始进行专门问题的研究。化学系分析化学教研组的教师们接受了产业部门的委托，正从事工业用水、石灰含量、煤的含热量和铁的成分等范围较小的分析研究工作。历史系教师唐长儒在研究中国中古史。七十多岁的老教授李剑农已经搜集了许多中国古代历史资料，有一个助教两个研究生帮助他作整理资料的工作。理科方面还准备陆续举行各种科学讨论会。
    北京师范大学四年级学生开始第二次教育实习
    北京师范大学一九五三学年度各系的四年级学生四百多人，在二十三日起开始第二次教育实习。这次教育实习对实习生的要求是通过课堂试教与做班主任的工作来培养担任中学教师所应具备的独立工作能力，了解普通中学、师范学校学习苏联先进经验的过程、成效与地方教育行政机关的方针任务，了解教学计划、教学内容和学校环境，掌握课堂教学的原则与方法，培养对学校教导工作的观察与分析能力，认识教育工作的重要性，并进一步巩固为人民教育事业服务的专业思想。本学期参加实习的有教育（学校教育与学前教育两个专业）、历史、中国语文、俄文、数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、音乐、图画制图等十一个系，共计四百三十六人。实习期限共五个星期。
