    Physical Education in the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Wang Ke
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army can become a heroic army that wins every battle is inseparable from the strong physique of all commanders and fighters. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has included physical education as an important part of the troops' training work from the very beginning of its establishment. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, in his book "On the Liberated Area Battlefield," more clearly stated: "Military training is divided into three aspects: intelligence, physical strength, and technique." Commander-in-Chief Zhu listed physical training as one of the three major components of military training and personally participated in various sports activities to lead the troops' physical education work.
    The physical education of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has a long history. During the counter-encirclement and suppression campaigns and the Long March in the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, although the troops were in an environment of heavy work, frequent battles, and extremely difficult material conditions, they never interrupted various physical exercises. In 1934, when the Red Army was in the most difficult situation, it still held a sports meeting in Ruijin, Jiangxi. In 1936, after the Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi during the Long March, it held a large-scale army-wide sports meeting in Qingyang, Gansu. At that time, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Red Army used the gaps between work and battles to participate in various sports activities. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Commander He Long not only organized and led the famous "Combat Basketball Team," which moved north and south with the army to promote sports activities in the troops, but also called on the troops to establish youth teams and sports training classes to carry out mass sports activities. During the same period, troops in other areas also carried out various physical exercises according to the environment, material conditions, and geographical conditions at the time. For example, troops stationed in mountainous areas practiced mountain climbing; troops stationed in plains practiced long-distance running and race walking; troops stationed on lakes practiced swimming and boating; troops stationed on grasslands practiced horsemanship, etc. This laid a good foundation for physical education in the troops.
    The reason why Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as leaders at all levels of the troops, attached special importance to physical education was to lay the foundation for commanders to master military technology and tactics, and to cultivate in the broad masses of fighters strong, endurance, mobile, and agile physical fitness and a brave, persevering, and accurate style, thereby cultivating excellent qualities of high organization, discipline, and collectivism, so that they can successfully carry out their tasks regardless of night, scorching heat, severe cold, wind, rain, ice, snow, or towering mountains, hunger, and fatigue.
    After the victory of the revolution, with the development of the situation, the troops moved towards regularization and modernization, and physical education also developed further. At the All-Army Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Work Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1950, a decision was made on carrying out literary and sports activities in the troops, pointing out that sports activities in the troops should be vigorously developed. In 1951, the entire army held basketball and volleyball competition conferences and football selection competitions. Because each unit universally carried out selection at each level before participating in the conference, ball games were further developed and promoted in the troops. In many grassroots units, equipment and venues for these two sports were built, and the broad masses of commanders and fighters participated in this sports activity. In order to further carry out mass sports activities and make them better serve combat and national defense, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day in 1952, the entire army held its first grand sports meeting. At this conference, the achievements of the troops in carrying out sports activities in the past two years were reviewed. Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed the entire army to "train ourselves to become men of iron physique and defend our most beloved country." According to the spirit of this instruction, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission determined the sports policy of "mass participation and combat readiness" and decided to establish sports propaganda teams in the entire army to guide and further promote sports activities in the entire army.
    After the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, each military region and special forces unit, based on the representative teams that participated in the conference, successively established sports propaganda teams and ordered them to go deep into their subordinate troops to conduct巡回宣传 and performance demonstrations. Their activities concretely and vividly publicized the spirit of the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, giving a deep impression to each unit and inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commanders and fighters to participate in sports activities. For example, a sports propaganda team of a certain military region held 104 sports symposiums and gave 143 performances of various sports events in the 32 troop units it visited. Through these many activities, they met with more than 200,000 spectators (or listeners). Another example is a representative team that traveled to 25 cities and 40 troop units in Northeast, North, East, Central South, and Northwest China, holding 51 symposiums and report meetings with the participation of active members of troop sports, and holding 157 performances of various events; in addition, it also organized more than 20 photo exhibitions on the development of troop sports. During the performances and symposiums, they used the method of combining lectures and demonstrations to specifically explain various rules and techniques, and promoted new sports ethics styles such as obeying referees, abiding by rules, being serious and earnest, and uniting and loving each other. Because these activities met the needs of the troops and the methods were diverse, they were warmly welcomed by commanders and fighters. After such activities, not only did leaders at all levels and commanders and fighters pay more attention to sports activities, but they also had a clear understanding of its development direction.
    Under the influence of the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, sports activities in the troops developed vigorously on the original basis. First, the troops under the major military regions and special forces units successively held sports meetings including various events, with the participation of the broad masses of soldiers as well as many middle and senior commanders; at the same time, troops stationed in various places launched various sports activities suitable for local geographical conditions and military needs. For example, a certain military region focused on developing swimming, and after only about a year, 90% of the personnel in the entire military region initially mastered this skill. Among them, an entire company of a certain army was able to cross a wide river about 200 meters wide while carrying weapons. In addition, many units have developed sidehorse, horizontal bar, and freehand calisthenics. The equipment required for these sports is relatively simple, and it greatly helps to physical training, so it has been listed as a compulsory subject of military training by the entire army. Among the various sports activities, ball games and gymnastics are the most popular among the broad masses of commanders and fighters, and are the most widely carried out. Now, on average, every company in the entire army has a team, and in some units that are particularly well-developed, every platoon or even every squad has a team organization. Every holiday or rest time, they are active on the grounds they have built, engaging in various sports exercises or competitions. In addition, freehand calisthenics has also become a regular activity for commanders and fighters in organs and troops.
    Due to the development of sports activities in the troops, the physical fitness of commanders and fighters has gradually been enhanced, and the efficiency of completing work and combat tasks has also been significantly improved. For example, Li Chaoke, an artillery soldier in a certain unit, used to get tired after loading a dozen 30-pound shells each time. Now he can load one hundred and several dozen shells in one breath, and his efficiency has increased nearly tenfold. Another example is Liu Hongsheng, a soldier in a certain military region, who used to blink as soon as the gun was fired when shooting targets, and his hit rate was very low. Since he practiced baseball, he no longer blinked when the gun was fired and greatly improved his hit rate. Sports activities also directly and effectively cooperated with the central tasks. For example, in the process of cultural learning, in units where sports activities were well-developed, the soldiers' learning efficiency was high, their memory was generally enhanced, and their academic performance was also better. Sports activities not only cooperated with the needs of military training, but also strengthened the connection and unity between troops and between superiors and subordinates, and between soldiers through friendly matches between squads and squads, platoons and platoons, and between units. This is just as a division commander of a certain division said: Through sports friendly matches, our cadres and soldiers, as well as us and fraternal troops, appear more cordial and united, and we are also more familiar and understand each other.
    The extensive development of mass sports activities has also significantly improved sports performance. This year, after the Chinese People's Liberation Army representative team won the national football championship at the National Football Competition and Youth Football Championship Conference in February, it then won four championships in men's and women's basketball and volleyball at the National Basketball, Volleyball Competition and Tennis and Badminton Demonstration Competition Conference in May. The men's basketball team also won the title of national absolute champion, earning praise from the conference and warm praise from the masses. At the National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Conference in early October, the Chinese People's Liberation Army representative team won first place in the track and field team total score with 140 points. Both men's and women's gymnastics won the all-around championship and achieved all the places in the all-around event—first, second, third, and fourth place. They also created several new national records in cycling with outstanding results. At this conference, a total of 19 records were broken in all competition events (10 for men and 9 for women), of which 12 were broken by athletes from the People's Liberation Army. The two records for men's long jump and women's javelin, which had been held for 20 years and 18 years respectively, were also broken by Gao Shugui and Yang Yizhuang, members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army representative team. The Chinese People's Liberation Army representative team received high honors at the conference: it won a total of 28 gold medals, 21 silver medals, and 31 other various medals. At the National Ethnic Sports Conference from November 8th to 12th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army representative team participated in three competitions: weightlifting, equestrian, and boxing, and achieved very good results. The five weightlifters of the People's Liberation Army participated in four levels of competition, of which four won the championship at each level with outstanding results, and one won the runner-up in the light heavyweight level. Li Junwei, who participated in the lightweight class, created a score of 295 kg, Zhu Hongquan in the middleweight class created a score of 305 kg, and Xiao Shanzu and Liu Yongfu in the light heavyweight class created a score of 315 kg. All four of these athletes created new national records. Yin Guohua, who participated in the light heavyweight class, also won the championship with a score of 272.5 kg. In the equestrian competition, the People's Liberation Army representative team won the first, second, and third places in the 1,600-meter light cavalry race, and the first, third, fourth, and fifth places in the horseback slashing race; in addition, in the light riding and obstacle performance competition, the athletes of the People's Liberation Army representative team won the performance excellence award. In the boxing competition, only two athletes from the People's Liberation Army representative team participated, winning the championship in the light heavyweight level and the third place in the lightweight level.
    The reason why the sports activities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been widely carried out and achieved remarkable results in a short period of time and within the scope of the entire army is the result of the care and attention of the leaders of the Party and the troops and the guidance of the correct policy of "mass participation and combat readiness", as well as the inheritance of the fine traditions since the founding of the army; it is the result of millions of commanders and fighters, after recognizing the important significance of sports serving national defense, learning from the advanced sports experience of the Soviet Union, and giving play to the spirit of diligence in learning and hard work under the education of patriotism and internationalism. In carrying out mass sports activities, the Chinese People's Liberation Army takes cultivating grassroots backbones and activists from mobilizing the masses as the first step. In the past four years, many short-term training classes for sports backbones have been held in various grassroots units, cultivating hundreds of thousands of sports backbones, who have specifically organized and promoted the sports activities of the broad masses of commanders and fighters. Along with the cultivation of backbones, the Military Training Department and the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission compiled and distributed various sports rules and teaching materials suitable for the needs of soldiers, so that soldiers can receive more regular sports guidance and exercise. At the same time, various weekend competitions and sports meetings of different scales were held in the troops in a planned manner to consolidate and improve the enthusiasm of soldiers for sports activities. In order to further promote sports activities to standardization and regularization, we have also absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and focused on promoting the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" system. In addition, units above the regiment level of the entire army should hold a sports meeting every so often to review the achievements and effects of carrying out sports activities. Experience has proved that this kind of sports meeting can not only enable the athletes from various grassroots units to improve their performance through mutual competition and exchange of experience, but also the meeting itself is the most effective way to strengthen unity, publicize, and promote sports activities. Therefore, after each sports meeting, the enthusiasm of commanders and fighters in various units to participate in sports activities has been significantly improved, and at the same time, mass sports activities have been improved one step further.
    The mass sports activities in the troops are often cared for and supported by leaders at all levels. Many unit leaders often participate in various activities and competitions, and personally lead and organize sports work. Especially when sports meetings are held, the responsible comrades personally arrange and plan the work tirelessly, and participate in various leadership work of the meeting. For example, when a certain unit held a sports meeting, the commander, political commissar, and director of the political department all participated in the preparation work, and the chief of staff personally served as the general commander of the meeting. Another example is that at the 1952 All-Army "August 1st" Sports Meeting, almost all the senior leaders of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission participated in the presidium of the meeting and personally guided it. As for the师 and团 holding sports meetings, the leaders not only take on the work of the meeting, but many also participate in various competitions. This not only ensures the smooth progress of the meeting, but also greatly encourages the emotions of commanders and fighters to participate in sports activities.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has made certain achievements in sports in the past four years, but these achievements are only a beginning in implementing Chairman Mao's wise instruction to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique", and are still far behind the development of other aspects of the troops' construction, and cannot fully adapt to the requirements of the construction of a modern and regularized national defense army; therefore, in order to continue to implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions at the opening ceremony of the 1952 "August 1st" Sports Meeting: "In order to accelerate the construction of the troops and improve military technology, it is necessary to universally develop military sports activities to train a strong physique, promote sports activities suitable for military needs, and serve combat and national defense construction." In order to make sports truly serve military training, military technology, and tactical needs, we must make greater efforts to complete the following tasks in the future:
    1. Further carry out mass sports activities and regularize and regularize this movement. To this end, it is necessary to vigorously implement the advanced Soviet "Preparation for Labor and Defense" system, and on the basis of summarizing the pilot experience of the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" system, formulate implementation methods and exercise standards suitable for the conditions of the troops, that is, divide exercise groups according to the characteristics of the military, age, and nature of work; and divide each group into several levels according to physical fitness, physical ability, and original technical level, and stipulate the compulsory and elective items and their standard requirements for each group and level; in addition, it is necessary to conduct tests regularly and in a planned manner, and give praise and rewards to outstanding and qualified persons to encourage competition and strive to fully promote this system in the short term.
    2. Vigorously cultivate amateur sports cadres. This can be done in the following ways: (1) Send people to sports schools to study; (2) Run short-term sports training classes and invite personnel from local sports institutions or school teachers to teach; (3) Organize sports activists to conduct short-term studies with the battalion and regiment as units to make them possess certain sports administrative or business knowledge and act as amateur sports backbones; (4) Sports propaganda teams should go deep into the troops to assist the troops in training grassroots amateur sports cadres.
    3. Establish and strengthen sports leading bodies at all levels.
    4. Supply troops with various sports equipment in a planned manner.
    5. Widely carry out publicity and education on sports and health knowledge.
    Although sports activities in the troops have aroused the attention and welcome of leaders at all levels and the broad masses of commanders and fighters; but it is undeniable that some cadres still have some incorrect views and opinions on sports activities. They emphasize that there is no time and do not actively support sports activities, thus affecting the development of mass sports activities to varying degrees; at the same time, some athletes and sports workers still have the mistaken idea of focusing on studying technology and ignoring political study and ideological transformation, which also hinders the improvement of their technical and business levels. This shows that they do not have a very clear understanding of the great significance of sports activities in the construction of the national defense army. Therefore, it is necessary to first correct these wrong views in the future and recognize the lofty purpose of sports activities in the troops—to exercise the physique of the broad masses of commanders and fighters and enhance their organization, discipline, mobility, and collectivist spirit, so as to regard sports activities as an important part of the troops' military training work and vigorously and comprehensively develop it; in addition, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of athletes and improve their political awareness so as to promote sports activities serving military technology and tactics more rapidly.
    The sports activities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have already had a relatively solid foundation. I believe that on this basis, with the care and advocacy of leaders at all levels of the entire army and the unremitting efforts of all commanders, fighters, athletes, and sports workers, the troop's sports work will play its due role in the great cause of national defense army construction and achieve greater success.

    中国人民解放军的体育运动
    王克
    中国人民解放军所以能够成为一支百战百胜的英雄军队，是和全军指挥员、战斗员有着健强的体魄分不开的。在毛主席直接领导下的中国人民解放军，从建军之初就把体育运动列为部队训练工作的重要内容之一。朱总司令在“论解放区战场”一书中更明确地提出：“练兵分三方面：一是智力，二是体力，三是技术。”朱总司令把体育训练列为练兵的三大内容之一，并亲自参加各种体育活动，来领导部队的体育工作。
    中国人民解放军的体育运动有着久远的历史。在第二次国内革命战争中的反围攻和长征中，在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争中，部队虽处在工作繁重、战斗频繁、物质条件极为艰苦的环境中，但从未间断各种体育锻炼。一九三四年，当时红军虽处在最困难的情况下，仍在江西瑞金举行了运动大会。一九三六年红军长征到达陕北后，又在甘肃庆阳举行了规模较大的全军运动会。当时红军的广大指挥员和战斗员都利用工作和战斗的空隙，参加了各种体育活动。抗日战争时期，贺龙司令员不仅组织和领导了有名的“战斗篮球队”，随军转战南北，在部队推行体育活动，并且号召部队成立青年球队和体育训练班，以开展群众性的体育活动。同一时期，其它地区的部队也都根据当时的环境、物质条件和地理条件，进行各种体育锻炼。如驻在山区的部队练爬山；驻在平原的部队练长跑和竞走；驻在水泊上的部队练游泳、划船；驻在草原的部队练习骑术等。这就使体育运动在部队中打下了良好的基础。
    毛主席和朱总司令以及部队各级首长们所以特别重视体育运动，其目的在于为指挥员掌握军事技术和战术打下基础，并培养广大战斗员具有强壮、耐劳、机动、敏捷的体能和勇敢、坚毅、准确的作风，从而养成高度组织性、纪律性、集体主义的优良品质，以便不论在夜间、酷暑、严寒、风雨、冰雪或丛山峻岭、饥饿疲劳等情况下，都能胜利地执行自己的任务。
    革命胜利后，随着形势的发展，部队走向正规化、现代化，体育运动也有了进一步的发展。一九五○年中国人民解放军全军宣传、教育、文化工作会议上，曾作了关于开展部队文艺和体育活动的决定，指出要大力开展部队体育活动。一九五一年全军举行了篮、排球比赛大会和足球选拔比赛。由于各单位在参加大会前普遍进行了逐级选拔，所以球类运动在部队中得到了进一步的开展和推广，在不少基层单位中都建设了这两项运动的器材和场地，广大指挥员和战斗员都参加了这种体育活动。为了进一步开展群众性体育运动，使之更好地为战斗和国防服务，一九五二年中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年，全军又举行了第一次盛大的体育运动大会。在这次大会上检阅了部队两年来开展体育运动的成绩。朱总司令指示全军，要“锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家”。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部根据这一指示的精神，确定了“群众性，战斗性”的体育运动方针，并决定在全军成立体育宣传队，用以指导和进一步地推动全军体育运动。
       “八一”体育运动大会以后，各军区和特种兵都以参加大会的代表队为基础，相继成立了体育宣传队，并令其深入所属部队进行巡回宣传和表演示范等活动。他们的活动具体而生动地宣传了“八一”体育运动大会的精神，给各部队以很深的印象，鼓舞了广大指挥员和战斗员参加体育运动的热情。如某军区体育宣传队在先后到达的三十二个部队单位中，召开了一百零四次体育座谈会，作了一百四十三场各种体育项目的表演。通过这许多活动，他们和二十多万观众（或听众）见了面。又如某代表队走遍了东北、华北、华东、中南、西北等地区的二十五个城市，四十个部队单位，共举行有部队体育积极分子参加的座谈会和报告会五十一次，举行各项表演达一百五十七场；另外还组织了二十多次关于部队体育运动发展情况的图片展览会。在表演和座谈时，他们采用边讲边作的方法，具体地讲解了各种规则和技术，宣扬了服从裁判、遵守规则、认真严肃、团结友爱等新的体育道德作风。由于这些活动切合部队需要，方式又是多种多样，所以受到指挥员和战斗员的热烈欢迎。经过这样的活动，不仅使各级领导机关及指挥员和战斗员对体育运动更加重视起来，而且对它的发展方向也有了明确的认识。
    在“八一”体育运动大会的影响下，部队体育运动在原有基础上蓬勃地发展起来。首先，各大军区和特种兵所属部队都先后举办了包括多种项目的运动大会，参加大会的有广大战士，也有不少的中级和高级指挥人员；同时各地驻军都展开了适合于当地地理条件和军事需要的各种体育活动。如某军区重点开展游泳运动，经过仅仅一年左右的时间，全军区就有百分之九十的人员都初步掌握了这项技术。其中某军的一个连队，全体人员都能够携带武器渡过约有二百公尺宽的大江。此外，很多单位都开展了木马、单杠和徒手体操运动。这些运动所需要的设备比较简单，而且大大有助于体力的锻炼，所以已被全军列为军事训练的必修科目之一。在各种体育运动当中，以球类和体操运动最为广大指挥员和战斗员所喜爱，开展得也最为普遍。现在全军平均每一连队都有一支球队，其中开展得特别好的一些单位，每一排、甚至一班都有球队的组织。每逢假日或休息时间，他们便活跃在自己修建的场地上，进行着各种各样的体育锻炼或比赛。此外，徒手体操也成为机关部队指挥员和战斗员的一种经常活动了。
    由于体育运动在部队中的开展，指挥员和战斗员的体质已逐渐增强，完成工作和战斗任务的效率也有了显著的提高。如某部炮兵战士李朝科填装三十斤重的炮弹，过去每次填装十几发就累了，目前一口气可以填装一百几十发，效率提高了将近十倍。又如某军区战士刘洪生，过去打靶时，枪一响就要眨眼，命中率很低。自他练习打棒球后，枪响不再眨眼了，并大大提高了命中率。体育运动也直接地、有效地配合了中心任务。如在文化学习过程中，凡是体育活动开展得好的单位，战士们的学习效率就高，记忆力也普遍增强，学习成绩也比较好。体育运动不仅配合了练兵需要，同时通过班和班、排和排以及各单位之间的友谊比赛，也加强了部队间的联系和上下级、战士和战士间的团结友爱。这正如某师师长所说的：经过体育友谊比赛，我们干部和战士以及我们和兄弟部队之间，显得更亲切、更团结了，彼此也更熟悉、更了解了。
    群众性体育运动的广泛开展，使运动成绩也有了显著提高。今年，中国人民解放军代表队在二月份全国足球比赛、青年足球锦标赛大会上取得全国足球冠军之后，继而又在五月间全国篮球、排球比赛和网球、羽毛球表演赛大会上取得了男、女篮排球四项冠军。男子篮球队并荣获全国绝对冠军称号，博得大会的表扬和广大群众的热烈称赞。在十月初全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会上，中国人民解放军代表队又以一百四十分荣获田径赛团体总分第一名，男女体操都获得了全能冠军，并取得全能项目的全部名次——一、二、三、四名，在自行车比赛中也以卓越成绩为全国创造了数项新纪录。这次大会在全部竞赛项目中打破纪录的共有十九项（男子十项、女子九项），其中十二项是人民解放军选手所打破的，而原已保持达二十年之久的男子跳远和原已保持了十八年的女子标枪两项纪录，这次也为中国人民解放军代表队队员高树贵、杨一庄分别打破了。中国人民解放军代表队在大会上得到了崇高的荣誉：共获得金质奖章二十八枚、银质奖章二十一枚，其它各种奖章共三十一枚。在十一月八日至十二日全国民族形式体育大会上，中国人民解放军代表队参加了举重、马术、拳击三项比赛，都获得了很好的成绩。解放军的五名举重选手，分别参加了四级比赛，其中四人均以卓越的成绩荣获各级冠军，另有一人，获次重级亚军。参加轻量级的李君伟，创造了二百九十五公斤的成绩，中量级的朱鸿荃创造了三百零五公斤的成绩，次重级的萧山祖、刘永福二人均创造了三百一十五公斤的成绩，这四名选手均创造了全国的新纪录。参加次轻级的殷国华也以二百七十二点五公斤的成绩获得冠军。在马术比赛中，解放军代表队获得了一千六百公尺轻骑赛的第一、二、三名，乘马斩劈赛第一、三、四、五名；另在轻乘、障碍表演赛中，解放军代表队的运动员荣获表演优胜奖。在拳击比赛中，解放军代表队只有两名选手参加，分别获得了次重级的冠军和轻量级的第三名。
    中国人民解放军的体育运动，所以在短短几年间、在全军范围内得到了广泛开展并获得了显著成绩，是由于全军指挥员和战斗员在党和部队首长关怀重视以及“群众性、战斗性”这一正确方针引导下，并继承了建军以来的优良传统的结果；是千百万指挥员和战斗员在认识了体育为国防服务这一重要意义后，在爱国主义和国际主义教养下，学习苏联先进体育经验，发挥了勤学苦练精神的结果。中国人民解放军在开展群众性体育运动中，是从发动群众中培养基层骨干和积极分子作为第一个步骤的。四年来，在各基层单位中利用业余时间举办过许多体育骨干短期训练班，培养了数以十万计的体育骨干，通过他们具体地组织和推动了广大指挥员和战斗员的体育运动。伴随着骨干的培养，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会军训部和文化部编发了适合于战士需要的各种运动规则和教材，使战士们能够得到比较正规的体育指导和锻炼。同时在部队中还有计划地举行了各种项目的周末比赛和不同规模的运动会，巩固和提高了战士们对体育运动的积极性。为了进一步把体育运动推向正规化、经常化，我们还吸取了苏联的先进经验，重点推行了“准备劳动与卫国”制。另外全军团以上的单位每隔相当时间便要举行一次运动会，以检阅开展体育运动的成绩和效果。经验证明，这种运动会不仅可使来自各基层单位的选手通过互相竞取、交流经验以提高其成绩，而大会本身便是加强团结、宣传和推动体育运动最有效的一种方式。因此每一次运动会之后，各单位指挥员和战斗员参加体育活动的热情都有显著的提高，同时，群众性体育运动也从而提高一步。
    部队中的群众性体育运动，经常得到各级首长的关怀和支持，有不少单位的首长还常常参加各种活动和比赛，亲自领导和组织体育工作。特别是当举行运动会时，负责同志都不辞劳苦地亲自布置筹划，并参加大会的各项领导工作。如某部队在举行运动大会时，司令员、政治委员和政治部主任都参加了筹备工作，参谋长并亲自担任大会总指挥。又如一九五二年全军“八一”体育运动大会，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的高级首长几乎全部都参加了大会主席团，亲临指导。至于师、团举办运动会时，首长不仅担任大会工作，有很多还参加各项竞赛。这不仅保证了大会的顺利进行，同时，也大大鼓舞了指挥员和战斗员们参加体育活动的情绪。
    中国人民解放军四年来在体育运动方面已取得了一定的成就，但这点成就不过是执行毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”这一英明指示的一个开端，还远落后于部队其它方面建设的发展，还不能完全适应于现代化、正规化国防军建设的要求；因此，为继续贯彻朱总司令一九五二年“八一”体育运动大会开幕典礼时的指示：“为加速部队建设及提高军事技术，还需要普遍发展军事体育活动，以锻炼坚强的体力，提倡适合于军事需要的体育活动，为战斗和国防建设服务。”使体育运动真正地为军事训练、为军事技术和战术的需要服务，今后我们必须以更大的努力来完成以下几项工作：
    一、进一步开展群众性的体育运动，并使这一运动正规化和经常化。为此，就必须大力贯彻苏联先进的“准备劳动与卫国”制，在总结“准备劳动与卫国”制试点经验的基础上，制订适合于部队情况的实施办法和锻炼标准，即根据兵种特点、年龄和工作性质划分锻炼小组；并根据体质、体能和原有技术水平，将每一组再划分为若干级，按照组别和级别规定其必修和选修项目及其标准要求；另外，要经常地、有计划地进行测验，对优秀和及格者，给予表扬和奖励，以资鼓励竞取，争取在短期内全面推行这一制度。
      二、大力培养业余的体育干部。这可采取如下几种办法：（一）派人到体育学校去学习；（二）开办短期体育训练班，邀请驻地体育机构的人员或学校教员授课；（三）以营、团为单位组织体育积极分子进行短期学习，使其具备一定的体育行政的或业务的知识，充当业余体育骨干；（四）体育宣传队要深入部队，协助部队训练基层业余体育干部。
    三、建立和加强各级体育领导机构。
    四、有计划地供应部队以各种体育器材。
    五、广泛展开关于体育、卫生常识的宣传教育。
      体育运动在部队中虽已引起各级首长和广大指挥员和战斗员的重视和欢迎；但不可讳言，有一部分干部对体育运动还有着一些不够正确的看法和观点，他们强调没有时间，不积极支持体育活动，因而或多或少地影响了群众性体育活动的开展；同时有一些运动员和体育工作者，还有偏重钻研技术、忽略政治学习和思想改造的错误观念，这也妨碍了他们的技术和业务水平的提高。这说明他们对体育运动在国防军建设中的重大意义，认识得还不十分明确。因此今后必须首先纠正这些错误看法，认识体育运动在部队中的崇高目的——锻炼广大指挥员和战斗员的体魄，增强他们的组织性、纪律性、机动性和集体主义精神，以便把体育运动当作部队军事训练工作中的一个重要内容，大力地、全面地发展起来；此外还必须加强运动员的政治思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，以便把为军事技术和战术服务的体育运动更加迅速地向前推进一步。
    中国人民解放军的体育运动已经有了比较巩固的基础。相信在这个基础上，在全军各级首长关怀倡导和全体指挥员、战斗员、运动员和体育工作者不懈的努力下，部队体育工作将在伟大的国防军建设事业中，起到应有的作用，并获得更大的成就。
