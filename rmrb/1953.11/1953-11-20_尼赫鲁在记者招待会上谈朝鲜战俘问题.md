Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru discussed the Korean prisoner-of-war issue at a press conference held in New Delhi on the 15th.

According to the Press Trust of India: "Nehru described the political conference as 'an important part' of the armistice agreement, saying that if the political conference could not be convened, the two commands would have to reconsider the future of the prisoners of war and seek some new agreement. The armistice agreement itself does not say this very clearly.

"One reporter pointed out that U.S. Ambassador Allen had indicated that if the political conference failed to materialize, the prisoners of war would be automatically released after one hundred and twenty days.

"Nehru said that this was probably the opinion of the United States. However, in his view, if an important part of the armistice agreement was abandoned, then the issue would have to be reconsidered by the parties concerned."

    尼赫鲁在记者招待会上谈朝鲜战俘问题
    【新华社十八日讯】印度总理尼赫鲁十五日在新德里举行的记者招待会上，谈到朝鲜战俘问题。
    据印度新闻处报道：“尼赫鲁把政治会议说成是停战协定的‘一个重要部分’，他说，如果政治会议不能召开，双方司令部就必须重新考虑战俘的前途，谋求某种新的协议。停战协定本身对这一点没有说得很清楚。
    “有一个记者指出：美国大使艾伦曾经表示，如果政治会议开不成，在一百二十天过后战俘将自动被释放。
    “尼赫鲁说，这大概是美国的意见。但是，照他看来，如果停战协定的一个重要部分被丢开，那么问题就必须由有关方面重新加以考虑。”
