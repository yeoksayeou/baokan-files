The Crux of the Interrupted Explanation Work
By our reporter, Hu Jin

The explanation work, which was interrupted for eight days (excluding Sundays), resumed on the 16th due to another effort by our side, but was interrupted again after only one day by the U.S. side's special agents.

This is the fifth interruption since the explanation work began. This interruption powerfully proves that the Lee-Chiang (Chiang Kai-shek) special agents, encouraged by the successive interruptions of the explanation work, are implementing the U.S. side's anti-explanation plan, becoming more and more rampant with each instance, repeatedly and prolongedly disrupting the explanation work, and then using new, more brazen, and more shameless sabotage activities to immediately interrupt the explanation work that has just been restored.

Now, fair world opinion must further recognize that the U.S. side is treating each effort we make to restore the explanation work as a sign of weakness, while at the same time desperately trying to cover up its unbridled plot to sabotage the explanation work.

The recent continuous interruptions of the explanation work are all due to the U.S. side, through its "detaining side representatives," "observation representatives," and Lee-Chiang special agents, using various illegal means to obstruct and sabotage, making it impossible for our explanation representatives to complete the daily explanation plan for one camp of prisoners of war under the conditions stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work." When our side proposed that the remaining unexplained prisoners of war must continue to be explained the next day, because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to separate the explained and unexplained prisoners of war for custody in accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules," and guarantee that the unexplained prisoners of war hear the explanation, the U.S. side took the opportunity to instruct the Lee-Chiang special agents to coerce the unexplained prisoners of war not to leave the camp to listen to the explanation, in order to interrupt the explanation work.

The U.S. side's repeated use of this illegal means of sabotage contains a more vicious intention than its past illegal means of obstructing the explanation work by coercing the entire camp of prisoners of war not to listen to the explanation at all. The U.S. side believes that this current practice can confuse public opinion, saying that it is not obstructing the prisoners of war from listening to the explanation, and that the responsibility for our side's failure to complete each explanation plan does not lie with the U.S. side's instructions to special agents to carry out sabotage. Recently, the U.S. side has greatly distorted the truth about the repeated interruptions of the explanation work, reversing black and white, and spewing blood, fabricating lies that the Korean-Chinese side "does not want to resume the explanation work" or "deliberately delays the explanation work," and exerting pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, forcing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to fulfill its responsibility to guarantee our side's freedom and convenience to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war. The serious problem is that the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only refuse to take effective sanctions against the sabotage activities of the special agents in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5, 7, and 20 of the "Detailed Rules" to ensure that the explanation work is not interrupted, using the unreasonable excuse of "no use of force," they even said that the explanation time for prisoners of war who are seriously suspicious by our explanation representatives is "too long" and "inhumane." As a result, the sabotage activities of the Lee-Chiang special agents have become increasingly rampant, and the U.S. side's lies are becoming louder and louder.

However, fair world opinion will not be confused or deceived by the U.S. side. The facts have been and continue to reveal the crux of the current explanation work, and who is trying every means to sabotage the explanation work.

Each time the explanation work is interrupted, it is restored due to our side's efforts. On the 14th, our side's General Li Xiangchao sent another letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, stating that in order to prevent the explanation work from being interrupted for a long time, our side is willing to make another effort, temporarily not conducting explanations to the unexplained prisoners of war in Camp 22, but changing to conducting explanations to the prisoners of war in Camp 53. As a result, the explanation work was resumed on the 16th. Doesn't this once again prove that the U.S. side's lies that our side "does not want to resume" and "deliberately delays" the explanation work are completely worthless?

However, in order to make the explanation work proceed smoothly, the fundamental problem is to stop the sabotage activities of the U.S. side and its running dog special agents. Therefore, General Li Xiangchao declared in the letter that our side reserves the right to continue to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war in Camp 22 at any time in the future, and at the same time, in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules," demands that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission earnestly guarantee three points: 1. Strictly prohibit special agents from any behavior that obstructs the explanation work, and be responsible for maintaining order in the explanation camp; 2. Strictly prohibit U.S. personnel from disrupting and interrupting the explanation work in the explanation tents, and even openly threatening prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation; 3. Immediately terminate the situation where certain Swiss or Swedish members of the subsidiary institutions arbitrarily, repeatedly, and for a long time interrupt our explanation work.

Any honest person will recognize that our side's attitude and demands are serious, earnest, and reasonable. If the U.S. side's sabotage activities to obstruct the explanation work can be curbed, then the explanation work can escape the current crisis of being obstructed and unable to proceed, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can also smoothly carry out its work.

However, the situation of the explanation work on the 16th proved that the sabotage activities of the U.S. special agents are even more lawless. According to the returnees who were explained and repatriated on that day, the Lee bandits' special agents had made a detailed sabotage plan in advance. They illegally detained four prisoners of war who requested repatriation, subjected them to severe torture, and did not allow them to listen to the explanation; at the same time, they transferred special agent elements from other camps, temporarily replaced the "battalion commander" and "company commander," and selected two groups of people to make trouble in the explanation tents, one group asked our explanation representatives a series of insulting questions to delay the explanation time; the other group hid knives, chili powder, disinfectant powder, and gravel, taking the opportunity to attack our explanation representatives. The U.S. side's so-called "new tactic" of sabotage plan was constantly "rehearsed" in the camp, and at the same time, the prisoners of war were intimidated, creating great terror, making the prisoners of war who wished to go home but were suspicious even more afraid to request repatriation. As a result, in the explanation tent on that day, our side's explanation work actually became a rampant activity of the U.S. special agents fighting and obstructing. Lee Seung-man's special agent leader Moon Jung-ho (living in Camp 49), who was mixed in with the prisoners of war, even openly personally went to the waiting tent to direct the sabotage activities and threaten the prisoners of war. Under this circumstance, only 228 people listened to the explanation on this day, and 30 of them were arrested by the Indian custodian forces for violence and trouble-making. Our captured personnel Park Yong-deok stayed in the terrifying explanation tent for four and a half hours, and finally expressed his desire to be repatriated.

This fact clearly shows that the so-called statement that our side's explanation time is "too long" and "inhumane" is not only completely unfounded, but is actually just an excuse for the increasingly rampant obstruction and sabotage activities of the U.S. special agents.

What stage has the current explanation work reached? Since the official start of the explanation work on October 15, as of November 18, nominally 35 days have passed, excluding rest days, in the 30 days that should have been explained, the actual explanation time is less than 6 days. If, according to the U.S. side's unreasonable demands, even the 20 days that the U.S. side deliberately delayed the construction of the explanation tents are counted within the so-called explanation time, then 55 days of the 90-day explanation time have passed, and the actual explanation time is almost only one-tenth of it. Can this be recognized?

Furthermore, taking the average explanation time of our side for each prisoner of war as an example, if our side's explanation work can be carried out smoothly in 32 explanation tents at the same time within the 90-day explanation time, without any interference or obstruction, then the average prisoner of war under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can hear one hour of explanation. The right of our prisoners of war to hear one hour of actual explanation time each is a right that is completely recognized and must be guaranteed by the "Terms of Reference," and no one can say that it is "too long." On the contrary, honest people will certainly understand that for our prisoners of war who have been tortured by the U.S. side and its running dog Lee Chiang special agents for two years and are suspicious, this explanation time is not "too long" but should be said to be too short. However, in the past only less than six days of explanation time, all our captured personnel who heard the explanation did not hear an average of one hour of explanation each. Taking the explanation work carried out on November 4 as an example, on that day, our captured personnel stayed in 32 explanation tents for a total of 166 hours and 58 minutes. Due to the obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. side and its running dog special agents and the interference of certain members of the subsidiary institutions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the actual explanation time for our side to the prisoners of war was less than 94 hours, so that the average actual explanation time for each of the 202 prisoners of war who heard the explanation was only 27 minutes. In the explanation work of our side in the subsequent five days and the 16th, the average actual explanation time for each prisoner of war was only 30 to 40 minutes. However, the explanation work of these few days has been considered "too long" and "inhumane" by some people. Can this be called a fair statement?

Now, after the U.S. side has sabotaged the explanation work to such a completely intolerable point, it is even more enthusiastic about clamoring that the explanation time is "fleeting," and if the political conference fails to reach an agreement on the handling of the non-repatriated prisoners of war within one month after December 23, the prisoners of war will be "released as civilians." But this
group of representatives of "modern civilization" and "humanitarianism," which is more greedy and ugly than slave owners calculating the number of slaves or medieval bloodletting money lenders calculating exorbitant interest, is gloatingly calculating the time for prisoners of war to listen to explanations and the deprivation of their right to be repatriated, while its blood-stained hands that forcibly detain prisoners of war cannot be hidden in any way.

The key to reversing the dangerous situation of the current explanation work lies in whether the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can immediately take effective steps against the sabotage activities of the U.S. special agents in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules." No member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should shirk responsibility, but should resolutely strive to fulfill its responsibilities. This is entirely possible, and the peace-loving people of the world will strongly support it.

### 解释工作中断的症结何在

    解释工作中断的症结何
    在本报记者　胡今
    中断了八天（星期日未计在内）的解释工作，由于我方的又一次努力而于十六日恢复后，仅进行了一天，又被美方特务所阻断了。
    这是解释工作开始以来的第五次中断。这一次中断有力地证明了：受到解释工作接连中断的鼓励的李蒋特务正在执行着美方的反解释计划，一次比一次地显得猖狂，反复地长期阻断解释工作，然后以新的更放肆更无耻的破坏活动使刚告恢复的解释工作立即又告中断。
    现在，世界公正舆论必须进一步认清美方以我方每次所作恢复解释工作的努力为示弱，而又竭力企图掩盖其肆无忌惮地破坏解释工作的阴谋诡计。
    最近解释工作的连续中断，都是由于美方通过其“拘留方代表”、“观察代表”及李蒋特务，使用各种非法手段进行阻挠破坏，使我方解释代表未能在“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”规定的条件下完成每天对一个营场战俘的解释计划。而当我方提出必须在第二天继续对其余未听解释的战俘进行解释时，因中立国遣返委员会未能按照“工作细则”的规定，把已听解释与未经解释的战俘分别看管，并保证未经解释的战俘听到解释，美方即乘机指使李蒋特务胁迫未听解释的战俘不出营场听解释，以阻断解释工作。
    美方一再使用这个非法手段进行的破坏活动，比它过去阻断解释工作时胁迫整个营场战俘根本不听解释的非法手段，包藏着更加恶毒的祸心。美方认为现在的这样做法可以迷惑舆论，说什么它并没有阻挠战俘听解释，说什么我方每次解释计划不能完成的责任不在于美方指使特务进行破坏。最近美方就大肆歪曲解释工作一再中断的真相，颠倒黑白，含血喷人，制造所谓朝中方面“不希望恢复解释工作”或“故意拖延解释工作”的谎言，并对中立国遣返委员会横施压力，迫使中立国遣返委员会不敢履行其保证我方得有向战俘进行解释的自由与便利的职责。严重的问题是，中立国遣返委员会的瑞士、瑞典委员也居然不仅不愿根据“工作细则”第五、七及二十款的规定，对特务的破坏活动采取有效的制裁措施，以保证解释工作免被阻断；甚至竟继其所谓“不得使用武力”的无理藉口，说我方解释代表对心存严重疑惧的战俘的解释时间“过长”、“不人道”。因此，李蒋特务的破坏活动就日益嚣张，美方的漫天谎言也叫得更响了。
    然而，世界正直舆论是不会受美方的任何迷惑和蒙骗的。事实已经而且不断揭露着当前解释工作的症结何在，千方百计地破坏解释工作的倒底是谁。
    每次解释工作被阻断后，都是由于我方的努力才告恢复的。十四日我方李相朝将军又致函中立国遣返委员会，表示我方为使解释工作不致陷于长期中断，愿意再作一次努力，暂时不向二十二号营场未经解释的战俘进行解释，而改向第五十三号营场的战俘进行解释。于是，解释工作便在十六日恢复进行。这难道不是又一次证明美方所谓我方“不愿恢复”和“故意拖延”解释工作的谎言，是根本不值一驳的吗？
    但是，要使解释工作得以顺利进行，根本的问题必须阻止美方及其走狗特务的破坏活动。所以，李相朝将军在信中声言，我方保留将来随时对二十二号营场战俘继续进行解释的权利，同时并根据“职权范围”和“工作细则”的规定，要求中立国遣返委员会切实保证三点：一、严禁特务任何阻挠解释工作的行为，负责维持解释营场的秩序；二、严禁美方人员在解释帐篷中扰乱并中断解释工作，甚至公开威胁战俘不得申请遣返；三、立即终止若干附属机构的瑞士或瑞典委员擅自与任意、多次并长时间地中断我方解释工作的情况。
    任何正直的人士都会认识到我方这个态度和要求，是严肃、认真和合理的。如果美方阻断解释工作的破坏活动得以被遏止，那末，解释工作就能脱出目前阻碍重重、无法进行的危机，中立国遣返委员会也就能顺利地执行工作。
    可是，十六日解释工作的情况证明美方特务的破坏活动更加无法无天了。据当天经解释遣返的归来人员说，李匪特务曾在事前作了周密的破坏计划。它们非法地拘禁了四名要求遣返的战俘，加以严刑拷打，不让听解释；同时并从其他营场调集特务分子，临时更换了“大队长”和“中队长”，挑选出两批人到解释帐篷捣乱，其中一批向我方解释代表提出一连串侮蔑性的问题，以拖延解释时间；另一批则藏着刀子、辣椒粉、消毒粉和碎石，借机向我方解释代表行凶。美方这个所谓“新战术”的破坏计划曾不断在营场中进行“演习”，同时并对战俘进行威吓，造成巨大的恐怖，使愿望回家而心存疑惧的战俘更加不敢要求遣返。于是，在当天的解释帐篷里，我方的解释工作，实际上就变成了美方特务大打出手和横加阻挠的猖狂活动。混入战俘中的李承晚特务头子文重浩（住四十九号营场）并公然亲自出马，到等待帐篷中去指挥破坏活动并威胁战俘。在这种情形之下，这一天听解释的又只有二百二十八名，其中有三十名行凶捣乱经印度看管部队予以逮捕。我方被俘人员朴龙德足足在恐怖万状的解释帐篷中呆了四个半钟头，最后才表示了要求遣返的愿望。
    这一事实清清楚楚地说明了：所谓我方解释时间“过长”“不人道”的说法不仅毫无事实根据，而且实际上不过是为美方特务进行的日益猖狂的阻挠破坏活动解嘲罢了。
    当前的解释工作已到了怎样的地步呢？自十月十五日正式开始以来的解释工作，截至十一月十八日为止，名义上已经过去了三十五天，除去休息日以外，在应该进行解释的三十天中，实际的解释时间却不到六天。如果照美方的无理主张，连美方故意拖延修建解释帐篷的二十天也算在所谓解释时间之内的话，那末，九十天的解释时间已过去了五十五天，而实际解释时间差不多只占其十分之一。这是能被承认的吗？
    再拿我方对每一个战俘的平均解释时间来说，如果我方的解释工作能在九十天的解释时间内同时在三十二个解释帐篷内顺利进行，不受任何干扰和阻断，那末，在中立国遣返委员会看管下的我方被俘人员平均每人可以听到一小时的解释。我方被俘人员每个人听一小时实际解释的时间，是“职权范围”的规定所完全承认和必须保证的权利，任何人都不能说什么“太长”，相反地，正直的人一定还会理解，对于遭受美方及其走狗李蒋特务折磨了两年之久而心存疑惧的我方被俘人员来说，这个解释时间不仅不“过长”而且应该说是过于短促了。但是，在过去仅有的不到六天的解释时间中，所有听到解释的我方被俘人员平均每个人并未听到一小时的解释。以十一月四日进行的解释工作为例，那天我方被俘人员在三十二个解释帐篷中停留了共一百六十六小时又五十八分钟，由于美方及其走狗特务的阻挠及破坏和中立国遣返委员会附属机构的某些委员的干扰，我方向战俘进行实际解释的时间不到九十四小时，以致二百零二个听到解释的战俘中平均每个战俘实际听解释的时间仅有二十七分钟强。我方在以后的五日和十六日两天的解释工作中，平均每个战俘听到实际解释的时间也不过三、四十分钟。可是，这几天的解释工作，却被一些人认为“过长”和“不人道”，这难道是可以称为公正的说法吗？
    现在，美方把解释工作破坏到如此完全不能令人容忍的地步以后，正在更加热中于叫嚷什么解释时间“瞬息即逝”，如果政治会议未能在十二月二十三日以后的一个月内对未遣返战俘问题的处理取得协议，战俘就要被“释放为平民”了。但是，这
  一群比奴隶主计算奴隶数目或中世纪放血钱的债主计算惊人高利还要贪婪丑恶的自称“现代文明”和
  “人道主义”的代表人物，在得意洋洋地计算着战俘听取解释的时间和行使其被遣返的权利横被剥夺的时候，它的一双血淋淋的强迫扣留战俘的血手，却是无论如何也掩藏不住的。
    扭转当前解释工作的危险局势的关键，在于中立国遣返委员会能否立即根据“职权范围”和“工作细则”，对美方特务的破坏活动采取有效的步骤。中立国遣返委员会的任何一个委员都不应该推卸责任，而应坚决地努力完成其职责，这是完全可能做到的，世界爱好和平的人民是会大力支持的。
