Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 7th: Hamblen, the head of the U.S. side's so-called repatriation group, issued a letter on the 6th, ordering his subordinates "not to directly discuss official matters with reporters" and requiring them to "ensure that their conversations are not overheard by representatives of the press when discussing official matters."

According to the Associated Press, Hamblen issued this order because U.S. observer representatives in the explanation tents carelessly revealed their relationship with spies in the prisoner-of-war camps in a conversation with American reporters on the 4th. During the explanation work on the 4th, many prisoners of war did not make a scene as instructed by the spies, but instead sat in the explanation tents for a long time to receive explanations, which greatly alarmed the U.S. representatives. Fearing that the prisoners of war would dispel their doubts and demand repatriation, they desperately clamored that the explanation time was too long and demanded that the explanation time be shortened, so as to deprive the prisoners of war of their right to listen to explanations and demand repatriation. A U.S. observer representative, Eurenan, exposed himself in this clamor to put pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He said, "It seems that the only thing that can influence the Indian chairman is violent action. If the prisoners of war do not take violent action, the chairman will let the Communist side talk for as long as they want."

Eurenan's intimidation blatantly showed that the "official business" of the U.S. side's so-called "repatriation group" was to direct the Li and Chiang Kai-shek spies to sabotage the explanation work and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. These words also prove that all the terror and violence perpetrated by the secret agents against the prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps were carried out under the direct command of the U.S. side. It was precisely because Eurenan's words exposed the trickery of the U.S. side's so-called "repatriation group" that Hamblen hurriedly ordered his spies not to talk to reporters about this kind of "official business" in the future. However, Hamblen's attempt to mend the fold after the sheep are lost not only failed to conceal the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war, but instead revealed his true colors all the more clearly.

### 汉布伦命令部下不得对记者谈“公务问题”  妄图掩盖美方指挥特务破坏解释工作

    汉布伦命令部下不得对记者谈“公务问题”
    妄图掩盖美方指挥特务破坏解释工作的罪行
    【新华社开城七日电】美方所谓遣返组组长汉布伦在六日发表了一封信，命令他的部下“不得直接和记者谈论公务问题”，并且要求他们“在谈论公务问题时，应确保他们的谈话不会被新闻界代表听见”。
    据美联社透露，汉布伦所以要发布这个命令，是因为在解释帐篷中的美方观察代表在四日在和美国记者谈话中不小心透露了他们和战俘营中的特务之间的关系。在四日解释工作进行中，许多战俘没有像特务所指示那样的大吵大闹，却长时期地坐在解释帐篷中接受解释，这种情形使美方代表极为惊慌。他们唯恐战俘消除了疑惧心理而要求遣返，因此拚命叫嚷说解释时间太长，要求缩短解释时间，以便剥夺战俘听取解释、要求遣返的权利。一名美方观察代表爱厄南就在这种对中立国遣返委员会施加压力的叫嚣中露了马脚。他说，“能影响印度主席的事情似乎就是暴力行动，如果战俘不采取暴力行动，主席就会让共方随便谈多久。”
    爱厄南的这种恫吓，十分露骨地表明美方的所谓“遣返组”的“公务”，就是指挥李、蒋特务破坏解释工作，阻挠战俘遣返。这些话也证明：所有在战俘营中发生的特务分子对战俘的恐怖和暴力行为，都是在美方直接指挥之下干出来的。正是由于爱厄南的话拆穿了美方所谓“遣返组”的西洋镜，汉布伦才慌忙命令他手下的那批特务以后不准对记者谈论这一类“公务”。但是汉布伦这种亡羊补牢的办法不但没有能够掩饰得住美方破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，反而欲盖弥彰地暴露了他自己的真面目。
