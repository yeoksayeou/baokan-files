The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government issued instructions on the "Current Situation of the Fuel Industry and Future Work Deployment." Excerpts are published as follows:

In the past three years, China's fuel industry has achieved certain successes in both production and capital construction. First, in accordance with the Central Committee's policy of leveraging the potential of existing equipment and actively carrying out restoration and reconstruction, new coal mining methods were implemented in state-owned coal mines, increasing the coal recovery rate from 30% before liberation to 76%. In the state-owned electric power industry, a system of regular maintenance was implemented, increasing equipment output by a total of 190,000 kilowatts, and the utilization rate of power generation equipment increased from 26% in the early days of liberation to the current 53%. Due to the reform of oil extraction and refining methods in the petroleum industry, the utilization rate of oil well production capacity increased from 30% in the early days of liberation to 65%, and the gasoline refining rate increased by 25%. As a result, the national output of coal and electricity in 1952 increased by more than double that of 1949, and the output of petroleum increased by more than triple, basically supplying the fuel and electricity needed for the country's industrial recovery period. Secondly, in terms of key construction projects, thanks to the Soviet Union's design and construction guidance, the construction of several large projects was completed. For example, new vertical shafts were built in Liaoyuan and Hegang in Northeast China, the Haizhou open-pit coal mine was built in Fuxin, and several power plants were expanded and newly built. From these construction projects, we learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, initially established specialized institutions for geological exploration, design, and construction, and cultivated some cadres, laying a preliminary foundation for future capital construction.

Production Problems and Improvement Methods

There are still many problems in the production of the fuel industry. The production situation in the first half of 1953 was not very good. The phenomenon of uneven production was common in the coal, electricity, and petroleum industries. The plan execution was generally relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, with the first quarter being poor and the second quarter being relatively better. Most coal mines and small oil refineries failed to complete their plans in the first half of this year. The following is a breakdown by coal, electricity, and petroleum industries:

Coal Industry

First, the lagging of tunneling work behind coal mining is a relatively serious problem in current coal mine production. Tunneling is an important part of ensuring continued production, but because the tunneling plan was not completed last year in various coal mines, it has seriously affected the current balanced production of coal mines, and has caused most mines to fail to complete their production plans for several consecutive months in the first half of this year. These mines must catch up on tunneling and production in the second half of the year, otherwise not only will this year's plan not be completed, but it will also affect the continued increase in output in 1954. Individual coal mines, in order to rush to complete tasks, only develop in depth (close to the wellhead, where coal can be quickly extracted), and not in the two wings. Some even continue to adopt the mining methods used during the enemy and puppet rule, only mining large and good coal, seriously damaging national resources. The main reason for this phenomenon is that some management cadres do not fully recognize the important position of tunneling work in coal mine production, and therefore relax their leadership over tunneling work, fail to allocate appropriate manpower, and only focus on immediate coal production, lacking long-term planning. Secondly, they have long neglected underground geological surveying work, and the resource situation has not been clarified, making tunneling work blind, which seriously affects the normal operation of coal mine production.

Second, safety work has not continued to improve, and accidents are still very serious. The main reason for accidents is that leaders at all levels lack frequent inspection and timely improvement of safety conditions. Among some leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel, there is still a lack of a clear responsibility system. Some cadres even have serious errors such as fear of trouble and侥幸 (jiao xing: a lucky accident, fluke), and turn a blind eye to certain workers' violations of safety regulations and lax discipline, or dare not take responsibility and let them drift, so that safety regulations and operating procedures cannot be implemented. Most mines have not formulated specific operating procedures according to safety regulations based on different situations. Safety education for workers is also mostly old-fashioned and generalized, regardless of the type of work or the target audience, so it cannot achieve the intended effect. The responsibility for those who cause accidents by violating regulations is not handled promptly and seriously enough, which also loses the binding effect that regulations should have on workers. In addition, the evils left over from backward production methods during the enemy and puppet rule cannot be fundamentally improved in the short term. Many necessary equipment and safety instrument spare parts have not yet met the requirements of technical safety regulations, which is also an important reason for the high number of accidents.

Third, another problem in coal mine production is that the quality of raw coal in some mines has declined, wasting the nation's transportation capacity, affecting the quality of products in other industrial sectors, and causing a backlog of some coal. The main reason for the low quality is that some leading cadres in coal mines have the idea of only seeking to complete output and ignoring quality, lack strict quality management systems and product acceptance systems, and have not actively improved coal mining technology, strengthened screening work, and chemical testing work in order to improve quality. Most mines do not have coal washing equipment or incomplete equipment, which also affects the improvement of raw coal quality.

In response to the problems existing in the coal industry, the following measures must be taken in the future:

First of all, in order to ensure the completion of the production plans for this year and next year, all mines must strengthen tunneling work, transfer veteran workers to the tunneling work face, and reasonably adjust the wages of tunneling workers. Organize rapid tunneling teams and promote the rapid tunneling experience of Ma Liu Hai and Cui Guo Shan. It is necessary to always maintain enough coal mining faces and more than a quarter of the reserve faces. This is an important part of implementing planned management in coal mine production and improving coal mine production capacity. At the same time, mining bureaus should make relatively long-term mining plans within this year and next year. It is necessary to strengthen geological and surveying work on existing production mines, further clarify the resource situation, make mine appraisals and reasonable mining plans, and gradually change the phenomenon that the degree of mechanization and production capacity of various production links do not match each other.

Secondly, to improve the safety work of coal mines and implement the policy of safe production. The responsibility system of administrative leaders and technical leaders at all levels should be clarified and implemented. The mine manager and chief engineer should be primarily responsible for the safety work of the mine, and must frequently check the safety work and deal with the problems existing in the safety work. All mines should strengthen technical safety education for employees, improve the safety responsibility system at all levels, revise operating procedures based on specific circumstances, and strictly operate in accordance with safety regulations.

Thirdly, improve coal quality. According to the different conditions of coal seams and quality in each mine, improve coal mining technology and methods, improve testing institutions, and make full use of existing washing equipment. Educate employees to recognize the importance of improving quality for ensuring the quality of other industrial products and saving the nation's transportation capacity, establish a strict quality inspection responsibility system and reward and punishment system, carry out mass work of emphasizing quality and inspecting夹石 (jia shi: gangue, shale) and gradually increase washing equipment.

Power Industry

First, the most serious problem in the power industry is that power generation and supply are not safe enough, which causes great losses to industry. The main reasons for accidents are poor maintenance quality. Before maintenance, there is a lack of practical and reliable analysis and research on equipment shortcomings, preparation work is insufficient, and the responsibility system and acceptance system are not implemented during maintenance. In addition, since the promotion of the "fast maintenance method," some bureaus and factories have blindly pursued speed and neglected quality, so accidents often occur after maintenance is completed. Secondly, some major equipment defects left over from the past have not been completely resolved. The maintenance of power supply equipment and auxiliary equipment is even worse, and restorative maintenance has not yet been completed. Thirdly, the technical operating procedures have not been carefully implemented, and the operating personnel cannot fully master the correct operating methods, and operational errors continue to occur.

Second, the work of leveraging the potential of power generation equipment and saving electricity has not been widely promoted. The main reason is the lack of a unified maintenance system. The power supply work in most areas has not been organized, so it is impossible to make up for deficiencies with surpluses, and the phenomenon of waste in electricity use is serious.

In response to the problems existing in the power industry, the following measures must be taken:

First, in order to further achieve the goals of safety and economy in power industry production, in the future, we should focus on conducting maintenance according to plan and not generally advocate "fast maintenance." Ensure maintenance quality and strive to reduce power outage time during maintenance. Repair plans should be drawn up for major defects in power generation and supply equipment, and resolved gradually over a certain period of time. Secondly, strengthen technical management. Learn and implement the "Regulations on Technical Management of the Power Industry," and revise accident handling, operation, and maintenance procedures this year based on the regulations and combined with the actual situation on-site. In order to make the most reasonable use of national electricity, starting this year, the periodic maintenance system stipulated by the Ministry of Fuel Industry should be implemented in power enterprises other than state-owned enterprises, and unified power dispatch should be carried out to adjust the load. In areas with an existing foundation, further pilot economic dispatch. The "two-part electricity price system" will be promoted by region to promote rational electricity consumption. Business departments should assist and guide users to improve electricity consumption work and assist users in solving technical difficulties. Electricity demand has been growing significantly every year, therefore, in addition to actively focusing on building new plants, the work of leveraging the potential of existing equipment is even more important. This work must be carried out steadily under the leadership of local party committees and financial committees. Local electricity bureaus must make decisions based on the different circumstances of various public and private users.

Petroleum Industry

First, the serious problem existing in oil refining is poor operation, low refining rate, and waste in the utilization of raw materials (crude oil and oil shale). In the first half of this year in the petroleum industry, due to violations of operating procedures and poor technical operations, a large number of defective products increased. The equipment maintenance work of the oil refinery is not timely, the maintenance quality is low, and the safe operation of the equipment is seriously affected.

Second, the main problems existing in oil extraction are the lack of attention to the rational exploitation of existing oil fields. We do not attach importance to the repair of old wells, do not pay attention to the protection and repair of existing production wells (such as sand prevention, wax removal, and wax passage), do not cherish the preservation of natural gas in the oil field (natural gas is the power of flowing wells), and do not study the law of oil layer changes well, so we cannot achieve rational oil extraction, resulting in a large loss of oil field capacity.

In response to the problems existing in the petroleum industry, the following measures must be taken:

First, in the utilization of oil refining raw materials, it is necessary to increase the refining rate while expanding the processing volume. Learn from the method of Dalian Refinery, conduct various experiments, find a rational ratio between the maximum processing volume and the highest refining rate, and take technical measures for weak links that affect the processing volume or refining rate to ensure the completion of this year's national plan indicators for the refining rate. This is the key to completing the product and cost plan. In the maintenance work, it is necessary to improve planning and organization to ensure timeliness and good quality. Revise the existing operating procedures and safety regulations so that they can truly guide production. At the same time, the "cyclic hanging sign inspection safety operation method" of Wang Kuan's team in Yumen Refinery should be promoted. Secondly, in oil extraction, we must adhere to the policy of rational oil extraction.

Problems in Capital Construction and Improvement Methods

The fuel industry department has not fully recognized the complexity and arduousness of capital construction, so when formulating plans, it mostly starts from needs,贪多贪大贪快 (tan duo tan da tan kuai: greedy for more, bigger and faster), and demands that some projects that can be postponed and are obviously insufficiently prepared and lack conditions be included in the plan. In addition, actively creating conditions is not enough, and capital construction plans have not been completed in recent years. In the process of formulating the Five-Year Plan and the 1953 plan this year, the fuel industry department criticized this erroneous冒进 (mao jin: rash advance) ideology, repeatedly revised the 1953 plan, and removed projects that lacked conditions. At present, there have been several improvements in the leadership, organization, and technology of capital construction, which has created favorable conditions for completing the national plan.

Main Shortcomings in Current Capital Construction Work

First, geological exploration is the weakest link in the fuel industry's capital construction work. We began to not deeply understand the importance of geological exploration in capital construction, and the leadership started to grasp it later, especially since the original foundation was very weak, which resulted in geological exploration work seriously lagging behind the needs of capital construction development. The poor quality and many errors in geological work directly affected the normal progress of drilling work. At the same time, the core recovery rate in drilling work is too low, and the work of recording, analyzing, and researching cores is done very poorly. Even in the process of drilling, oil sands are missed and coal seams are lost, so that after drilling is completed, a correct geological report cannot be made.

Second, the main problems existing in the design work are that the level of design personnel is low, the types of work are unbalanced, and the strength and tasks are not commensurate, which cannot meet the needs of construction. The technical level of technical personnel in various specialized design bureaus is generally low, and the bourgeois viewpoints and technical conservatism of some technical personnel are still quite serious, so the design is often reworked, resulting in great waste and the inability to complete tasks. The main problem lies in the weak ideological and professional leadership of the leadership. The design organization lacks backbones, and various erroneous ideas and erroneous designs have not been criticized in a timely manner. The organization and assistance of design personnel to learn from Soviet design experience has also been done very poorly, so that the political and technical level of design personnel cannot be improved quickly, and the efficiency and quality of design work have not been significantly improved. The losses caused by design errors and delays to construction work are very large. In addition, the imbalance of design personnel's types of work (especially the lack of civil engineering and engineering geology personnel), the failure to balance and allocate design forces in a timely manner, and the unsoundness of the design review organization have also affected the progress and quality of design work.

Third, the problems in construction work are organizational chaos, low quality, and great waste. The main manifestations are that several projects are started without sufficient preparation of design, equipment, and materials, so the chaotic phenomenon of waiting for drawings, waiting for materials, material backlog, and repeated rework often occurs. This year, the construction force has developed rapidly, the scope is large, the leadership is decentralized, and the organization is unsound. There is a serious phenomenon of widespread unclear responsibilities and no one being responsible on construction sites. Due to the lack of a unified construction plan and a sound scheduling system, the projects of various units have not been arranged in order of priority, and the balance of construction forces, materials, and equipment has not been well studied, so some units are idle in large quantities, while others lack workers. Some units' supply of materials and equipment is not timely, while others have backlogs, which affects the progress of the project. As for financial management, it is even more chaotic. The vast majority of projects cannot make budget settlements on time, and the idea of economic accounting in capital construction is still extremely weak.

In order to change the above situation, in the work of revising the Five-Year Plan and formulating the 1954 plan, we should further review and study the construction conditions of new and expanded factories and mines, accurately grasp the reliability of the plan, overcome the 冒进 (mao jin: rash advance) mentality of simply starting from subjective wishes without considering possible conditions. On the other hand, we must strive to strengthen the geological exploration force, rectify and strengthen the design and construction organization, and solve the contradiction between the capital construction force and the needs from a positive perspective.

Issues to Pay Attention to in Future Capital Construction Work

In order to complete this year's capital construction plan and prepare for future capital construction work, the following tasks should be focused on immediately:

First, effectively change the backward situation of geological exploration and improve the quality of geological exploration work. What needs to be solved first this year is: continue to strengthen forces from all aspects in the organization, concentrate experienced geological personnel, and equip them with assistants to complete the compilation and review of geological reports necessary for this year's and next year's design work. Implement operating procedures in geological work, establish and improve the responsibility system in drilling work; frequently go to the field for inspections, discover and solve problems in geological drilling, and effectively improve the quality of drilling. In drilling work, the technical responsibility system should be strengthened to increase the core recovery rate. In conjunction with the above tasks, specifically criticize various incorrect ideological viewpoints in exploration work, correct the current errors in geological work that lack a clear purpose (finding a certain amount of oil or coal in a certain period) and the individualistic thinking of not conducting comprehensive research, such as the lack of coordination between surface geological surveys, geophysics, and underground geological work.

Second, actively improve the political and professional level of design personnel, and continue to replenish the design force. Review the design projects of various specialized design bureaus that have not yet been completed, solve key problems such as unclear tasks, insufficient data, and unbalanced types of work in design work, and strive to complete the preliminary design of important projects next year in the fourth quarter so that the construction engineering designs that must be carried out in the first and second quarters of next year can be submitted on time. Soviet design experts will continue to arrive, which is a favorable condition for us to learn from the Soviet Union, improve design work, and improve the level of design. Therefore, it is necessary to implement professional division of labor, equip dedicated personnel, and systematically and completely learn from Soviet experts to cultivate design backbones. Rectify the organization, adjust the force, clarify the division of labor under a unified plan, and adjust the types of work according to the task. Continue to select technical cadres and college students with good quality to work in various specialized design bureaus. In addition, the design review organization should also be strengthened to carefully review each important design and make conclusions in a timely manner. For general housing construction, use standard designs as much as possible and simplify the design procedures for "partial reconstruction" of existing production factories and mines. Compile and organize necessary design regulations and technical standards and formulate work quotas. Summarize work in a timely manner, educate cadres, learn lessons from several important designs, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to improve the level of design.

Third, in order to ensure the quality of capital construction projects, complete tasks on schedule, and overcome waste, construction units must establish and improve the responsibility system, mainly the establishment of a quality responsibility system and a responsibility system between Party A and Party B. Establish and improve the scheduling system, balance material supply in a timely manner, and solve the problem of labor allocation. Organize original records, compile quotas, and lay the foundation for next year's plan management. Prepare next year's construction plan and prepare for winter training work.

Fourth, complete the collection of foreign design data.

Fifth, do a good job in cultivating cadres. In addition to improving the professional and technical level of on-the-job employees according to the principle of learning what you do, we should actively rectify the secondary technical schools of various majors, adjust majors, strengthen teachers, organize and translate teaching materials, and improve teaching leadership to improve the quality of teaching.

Strengthen Political Work

Leading cadres at all levels of the Ministry of Fuel Industry lack investigation and research, do not have enough understanding of the situation below, lack systematic inspection of work, and are not good at summarizing experience in a timely manner, so they have not been able to continuously enrich themselves and improve cadres. The leading organs do not tightly grasp the central work of each period, and the leadership is generally generalized, often lacking specific measures to implement the plan in a step-by-step manner. The division of responsibilities is unclear in organizational leadership, and they are not good at exerting organizational strength to promote work, so that the leadership is busy and the work efficiency is not high. Therefore, the key to improving work lies in improving leadership and overcoming bureaucratism in leadership. For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen the political theory learning and professional learning of leading cadres, systematically study the laws and key issues in production and capital construction based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and in combination with China's specific conditions, improve themselves, and lead the lower levels. In order to overcome the shortcomings in organizational leadership, it is also necessary to give play to the role of collective leadership and further clarify the responsibility system at all levels. At present, there are many problems in various enterprise units, and the work is very heavy. Therefore, various enterprises must still take improving planned management and implementing job plans as the center, and establish and improve the responsibility system for production management, especially the establishment and improvement of the scheduling system, the supply responsibility system, the technical safety, and quality responsibility system, so that everyone is responsible for every job, overcomes weak links, and organizes balanced production.

Geological exploration personnel under the Ministry of Fuel Industry have long been scattered in fieldwork, and coal mining is also underground work, which is extremely dispersed, and the mobility of employees is relatively large. Therefore, in order to complete the above production and capital construction tasks, it is necessary to especially strengthen political work in enterprises, and frequently conduct political education centered on production, so that the vast number of employees understand the significance of the work, the work policy, the current central task, and the methods of completing the task, in order to improve the political awareness of employees, consolidate conscious labor discipline, improve vigilance, strengthen the security work of enterprises, and prevent sabotage activities by enemies and counter-revolutionaries; we must care about the health and welfare of employees, appropriately use this year's investment, and solve current urgent problems.

    燃料工业部部署今后工作
    中央人民政府燃料工业部发布了“目前燃料工业情况及今后工作部署”的指示。兹摘要发表如下：
    三年多来，我国燃料工业在生产和基本建设方面，都获得了一定的成就。首先，根据中央关于发挥现有设备潜力、积极进行恢复改建的方针，在国营煤矿中推行了新式采煤方法，使煤炭回采率由解放前的百分之三十提高到百分之七十六；在国营电力工业中推行了定期检修制度，提高设备出力共达十九万瓩，发电设备利用率从解放初期的百分之二十六提高到目前的百分之五十三；石油工业由于采油、炼油方法的改革，油井生产能力的利用率从解放初期的百分之三十提高到百分之六十五，汽油炼率提高了百分之二十五。这样就使一九五二年全国煤、电产量比一九四九年增长一倍以上，石油产量增长两倍以上，基本上供应了国家工业恢复时期所需要的燃料和电力。其次，在重点建设方面，由于得到苏联代为设计和施工上的指导，完成了若干巨大工程的建设，如在东北的辽源、鹤岗两处建设了新的立井，在阜新建设了海州露天煤矿，扩建和新建了几座发电站，并从这些建设中学习了苏联的先进经验，初步建立了地质勘探、设计、施工等专业机构，培养了一些干部，为今后基本建设打下了初步基础。
      生产方面的问题及改进的方法
    燃料工业的生产方面还存在许多问题。一九五三年上半年生产情况不大好，生产不均衡的现象在煤、电、石油三类工业中都是普遍存在，计划执行情况一般是月初松、月末紧，一季差、二季比较好，各石油小厂与多数煤矿今年上半年一直未能完成计划。兹按煤炭、电业、石油三个专业分述如下：
    煤炭工业
    第一、煤矿的掘进工作落后于采煤是当前煤矿生产上比较严重的问题。掘进工作是保证继续生产的重要环节，但由于去年各煤矿没有完成掘进计划，因而严重地影响了当前煤矿的均衡生产，并使今年上半年大部分矿山连续几个月未能完成生产计划。这些矿山下半年必须既赶掘进，又赶产量，否则不但今年的计划完不成，且势将影响到一九五四年产量的继续提高。个别煤矿为了赶任务，只向纵深发展（靠近井口，可以很快的出煤），不向两翼发展，甚至继续采用敌伪统治时期只开大煤和好煤的开采方式，严重地损害了国家资源。造成这一现象的原因，主要是由于部分管理干部对掘进工作在煤矿生产中所占的重要地位认识不足，因而放松了对掘进工作的领导，没有适当配备力量，只图眼前出煤，缺少长远打算；其次是长期忽视井下地质测量工作，资源情况未摸清，掘进带有盲目性，严重影响了煤矿生产的正常进行。
    第二、安全工作未能继续改善，事故情况仍很严重。造成事故的主要原因是各级领导缺乏对安全条件的经常检查和及时改善；在部分领导干部及工程技术人员中，还缺乏明确的责任制度；有些干部甚至存在着怕麻烦、图侥幸等严重的错误，对于某些职工违反保安规程及纪律松弛等现象熟视无睹，或不敢负责，任其自流，因而使保安规程与操作规程不能贯彻。大部分矿山没有根据保安规程，按不同的情况制定具体的作业规程，对工人的安全教育亦多是老一套、一般化，不分工种，不看对象，因而不能收到应有的效果；对违反规程造成事故的责任者处理不及时和不够严肃，也失去了规程对职工应有的约束作用。此外，敌伪统治时期落后生产方法所遗留下来的恶果，短期内还不能求得根本改善，很多必要的设备与安全仪器备件等，尚未作到合乎技术保安规程的要求，这也是事故多的重要原因。
    第三、煤矿生产中的另一问题，是部分矿山的原煤质量下降，浪费了国家的运输能力，也影响着其他工业部门产品的质量，而且造成了部分煤炭的积压现象。造成质量低下的主要原因，是由于煤矿中的部分领导干部存在着只求完成产量而忽视质量的思想，缺乏严格的质量管理制度和产品验收制度，没有积极地为改善质量而改进采煤技术，加强筛选工作和化验工作。大部分矿山没有选煤设备或设备不全，也影响原煤质量的提高。
    针对煤炭工业中存在的问题，今后必须采取以下措施：
    首先，为了保证今年和明年生产计划的完成，各矿当前必须加强掘进工作，抽调老工人到掘进工作面，并合理调整掘进工人的工资。组织快速掘进队，推广马六孩、崔国山快速掘进经验。做到经常保持足够的采煤工作面与四分之一以上的预备工作面，这是煤矿生产实行计划管理及提高煤矿生产能力的重要环节。同时，应以矿务局为单位，于今明年内作出比较长远的开采计划。必须加强对现有生产矿井的地质和测量工作，进一步摸清资源情况，做出矿井鉴定与合理的开采计划，并逐渐改变各个生产环节的机械化程度和生产能力互不配合的现象。
    其次，要改善煤矿的安全工作，贯彻安全生产的方针。应明确和贯彻各级行政领导和技术领导的责任制度，矿长、主任工程师对矿井的安全工作应负主要责任，必须经常检查安全工作的情况及处理安全工作中存在的问题。各矿应加强对职工的技术安全教育，逐级健全安全责任制，依据具体情况修订作业规程，严格按照保安规程作业。
    再次，是改进煤的质量。根据各矿煤层和质量的不同情况，改进采煤技术和方法，健全化验机构，并充分利用现有的洗选设备。教育职工认识到改进质量对于保证其他工业产品质量和节省国家运输能力的重要性，建立严密的质量检验专责制度和奖惩制度，开展群众性的重视质量、检夹石的工作，并有步骤地增加洗选设备。
    电力工业
    第一、电力工业中存在的最严重的问题，是发电和供电不够安全，由此而造成工业上的损失很大。产生事故的主要原因是检修质量不好，检修前对设备的缺点缺乏切实可靠的分析研究，准备工作不充分，检修时又没有贯彻专责制度和验收制度，加以推行“快速检修法”以来，有的局厂又产生了盲目图快和忽视质量的偏向，所以往往检修才完又出事故。其次是过去遗留下来的若干设备上的重大缺陷，还未能完全解决。对于供电设备和附属设备的检修做得更差，恢复性的检修还没做完。再次，是由于技术操作规程没有认真执行，运行人员不能完全掌握正确的运行方法，操作错误的情况不断发生。
    第二、发挥发电设备的潜在力与节约用电的工作还未广泛推行。主要原因是由于缺乏统一的检修制度；多数地区的电力供应工作尚未组织起来，因此不能以有余补不足，电力使用上的浪费现象严重。
    针对电力工业中存在的问题，必须采取下列措施：
    首先，为了进一步达到电业生产的安全和经济的目的，今后应着重按计划进行检修，不一般地提倡“快速检修”。保证检修质量，并争取减少检修的停电时间。发电、供电设备上的重大缺陷应拟定检修计划，在一定的时间内逐步解决。其次，要加强技术管理。学习和贯彻“电力工业技术管理法规”，依据法规结合现场的实际情况，今年内着重修订事故处理、运行及检修规程。为了使全国电力得到最合理的使用，从今年起，在国营以外的电力企业中应推行燃料工业部所规定的定期检修制度，进行电力的统一调度，以调整负荷，在已有基础的地区，进一步地试行经济调度；分区推行“二部电价制”，以促进合理用电；业务部门应协助与指导用户改善用电工作，协助用户解决技术上的困难。电力需要逐年都有很大的增长，因之，除积极抓紧建设新厂外，发挥现有设备的潜力的工作就更重要，这一工作必须在各地党委、财委领导下，各地电业局要根据各地公私用户的各种不同情况，做出决定，稳步进行。
    石油工业
    第一、炼油方面存在的严重问题，是操作不良，炼率低，对原料（原油和油页岩）的利用存在浪费现象。今年上半年石油工业中，由于违反操作规程与技术操作不良，使废品次品大量增加。炼油厂的设备检修工作不及时、检修质量低，设备的安全运行受到严重的影响。
    第二、在采油方面存在的主要问题，是不重视对现有油田的合理开采。不去重视对老井的修复，不注意现有生产井的护修（如防沙、洗蜡、通蜡），不爱惜油田内天然气的保存（天然气是自喷井的动力），不很好研究油层变化的规律，因而不能实现合理采油，造成油田能力的大量损失。
    针对石油工业中存在的问题，必须采取以下措施：
    首先，在炼油原料的利用上，必须做到在扩大处理量的同时，提高炼率，学习大连炼厂的办法，进行各种试验，找出最大处理量与最高炼油率的合理化比例，对影响处理量或炼率的薄弱环节，采取技术措施，以保证完成今年国家对炼油率的计划指标，这是完成产品与成本计划的关键。在检修工作中必须提高计划性与组织性，做到及时、质量好。修订现有操作规程与保安规程，使之真正能在生产上起指导作用，同时应推广玉门炼油厂王宽小组的“循回挂牌检查安全操作法”。其次，在采油方面，必须坚持合理采油的方针。
    基本建设方面的问题及改进的方法
    燃料工业部门由于对基本建设的复杂性、艰巨性认识不足，因而在制定计划时，多从需要出发，贪多贪大贪快，一些可以缓办和显然准备不足、条件不够的工程都要求列入计划，加以积极创造条件不够，几年来基本建设计划都没有完成。今年燃料工业部门在制定五年计划与一九五三年计划的过程中，批判了这种错误的冒进思想，对一九五三年计划进行了反复的修正，去掉了条件不足的工程项目。目前基本建设的领导、组织和技术等各方面都有若干改进，这就为完成国家计划创造了有利的条件。
    当前基本建设工作中的主要缺点
    第一、地质勘探是燃料工业基本建设工作中最薄弱的环节。我们开始对地质勘探在基本建设中的重要性体会不深，领导方面抓得较晚，特别是原有基础很薄弱，以致造成地质勘探工作严重地落后于基本建设发展的需要。地质工作的质量差、错误多，更直接地影响了钻探工作的正常进行。同时，钻探工作中的岩心采取率太低，对岩心记录、分析、研究工作做得很差，甚至在钻进中遗漏了油砂，丢掉了煤层，结果打完了钻，不能做出正确的地质报告来。
    第二、设计工作中存在的主要问题，是设计人员水平低，工种不平衡，力量和任务不相适应，不能满足建设的需要。各专业设计局技术人员一般技术水平低，部分技术人员中资产阶级观点和技术上的保守思想还相当严重，因而设计常常返工，浪费很大，任务完不成，主要问题在于领导方面的思想与业务的领导薄弱，设计机构中缺乏骨干，对于各种错误思想、错误设计没有及时批判，认真地组织和帮助设计人员学习苏联设计经验也做得很不够，因而设计人员的政治水平与技术水平不能得到较快的提高，设计工作的效率与质量也没有显著的改善。设计的错误和延期给建设工作上带来的损失是很大的。此外，设计人员的工种不平衡（特别缺乏土木、工程地质等人员），设计力量未能及时平衡调配，设计审查机构不健全，也影响了设计工作的进度和质量。
    第三、施工工作中的问题，是组织混乱、质量低、浪费大。主要表现在若干工程在设计、设备、器材等准备不足的情况下即行开工，因而经常发生停工待图、停工待料、材料积压、一再返工等混乱现象。今年施工力量发展很快，摊子多，领导分散，组织不健全，工地普遍存在着职责不清的严重无人负责现象。由于没有统一的施工计划与健全的调度制度，各单位工程未能按先后次序排定，没有很好研究施工力量和材料、设备的平衡，因而有的单位大量窝工，有的则工人不足，有的单位材料、设备供应不及时，有的单位却形成积压，因而影响了工程进度。至于财务管理就更混乱，绝大多数的工程都不能按时作出预算决算，基本建设中的经济核算思想还极为薄弱。
    为了改变上述状况，应在修订五年计划与制定一九五四年计划的工作中，进一步审查研究新建、扩建厂矿的建设条件，确切掌握计划的可靠程度，克服单纯从主观愿望出发而不考虑可能条件的冒进情绪；另一方面，必须努力壮大地质勘察力量，整顿与加强设计与施工组织，从积极方面解决基本建设力量与需要不相称的矛盾。
    基本建设工作今后应注意的问题
    为了完成今年基本建设计划，并为今后基本建设工作做好准备，应即抓紧作好下列工作：
    第一、有效地改变地质勘探的落后形势，并提高地质勘探工作的质量。今年需要首先解决的是：在组织上继续从各方面壮大力量，集中有经验的地质人员，并配备助手，完成编制与审定今年与明年设计工作所必需的地质报告。贯彻地质工作中的操作规程，建立与健全钻井工作中的专责制度；勤到野外检查，发现与解决地质钻探中的问题，有效地提高钻探的质量。钻井工作中，应加强技术专责制，提高岩心采取率。结合上述任务，具体批判勘探工作中的各种不正确思想观点，纠正目前地质工作中缺乏明确目的性（在一定时期找到一定数量的油或煤）的错误，以及不做综合研究的单干思想，如地面地质调查、地球物理与地下地质工作互不配合的现象等。
    第二、积极提高设计人员的政治和业务水平，并继续充实设计力量。审查各专业设计局还没有完成的工程设计项目，解决设计工作中任务不明，资料不足，工种不平衡等关键问题，并争取第四季编完明年重要工程项目的初步设计，使明年一、二季必须施工的工程设计，能按期交出。苏联设计专家将继续到来，这是我们学习苏联、改进设计工作、提高设计水平的有利条件，因此必须实行专业分工，配备专人，系统地和成套地向苏联专家学习，以培养设计骨干。整顿组织，调整力量，在统一计划下明确分工，并根据任务调整工种，继续选派质量优良的技术干部大专学生到各专业设计局工作。此外，还应加强设计审查机构，以便认真审查每项重要设计，及时做出结论。对于一般房屋建筑，尽可能采用标准设计，并简化现有生产厂矿“局部改建”的设计程序。编译和整理必要的设计规程和技术标准，制定工作定额。及时总结工作，教育干部，从几个重要设计中吸取经验教训，开展批评与自我批评，以提高设计水平。
    第三、为了保证基本建设工程的质量，按期完成任务，克服浪费，施工单位必须建立与健全专责制度，主要是建立质量责任制与甲乙两方的责任制。建立与健全调度制度，及时平衡器材供应，并解决劳动力调配问题。整理原始记录，编制定额，为明年计划管理打下基础。编制明年的施工计划，准备冬训工作。
    第四、要完成国外设计的资料搜集工作。
    第五、做好培养干部的工作。除根据做什么学什么的原则，提高在职职工的业务水平和技术水平外，应积极整顿各专业的中等技术学校，调整专业，充实教员，整理和翻译教材，改进教学领导，以提高教学的质量。
    加强政治工作
    燃料工业部各级领导干部中缺乏调查研究，对下面情况摸底不够，缺乏有系统地检查工作而又不善于及时总结经验，因而未能不断地充实自己，提高干部。领导机关对每个时期的中心工作抓得不紧，领导一般化，往往缺乏有步骤地贯彻计划的具体措施。表现在组织领导上职责不清，不善于发挥组织力量，推动工作，以致领导上忙忙碌碌，工作效率不高。因此，改进工作的关键在于改善领导，克服领导方面的事务主义和官僚主义。为此，就必须加强领导干部的政治理论学习和业务学习，有系统地根据苏联先进经验，结合我国具体情况钻研生产和基本建设中的规律及其关键问题，提高自己，带动下级，为了克服组织领导上的缺点，还必须发挥集体领导的作用，并进一步明确各级负责制。目前各企业单位存在的问题很多，工作也很繁重，因此，当前各企业仍须以健全计划管理、推行作业计划为中心，建立与健全生产管理的责任制，特别是建立与健全调度制度、供应专责制度、技术安全和质量专责制度，使每一工作都有人负责，克服薄弱环节，组织均衡生产。
    燃料工业部所属地质勘测人员长期分散在野外工作，采煤又是地下作业，极为分散，职工流动性较大，因此，完成上述生产和基本建设任务，必须特别加强企业中的政治工作，经常地以生产为中心进行政治教育，使广大职工了解工作的意义、工作方针、当前的中心任务以及完成任务的方法，以提高职工的政治觉悟，巩固自觉的劳动纪律，提高警惕，加强企业的保卫工作，防止敌人及反革命分子的破坏活动；必须关心职工的卫生福利问题，适当使用今年的投资，解决当前的急迫问题。
