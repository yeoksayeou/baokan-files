The Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People

　　Xu Huaxie Bravely Saves the Wounded
　　One afternoon in early June after a rain, the cannon roared on Chestnut Valley South Mountain. Xu Huaxie, a Korean woman, was leading a stretcher team, carrying a seriously wounded soldier along the highway on the sunny slope of the mountain. Suddenly, seven enemy planes swooped down, and after a burst of machine gun fire, taking advantage of the enemy planes circling, Xu Huaxie quickly told the other sisters to lie down in the ditch beside the highway. She herself carried the wounded soldier on her back and ran into the pine forest. The wounded soldier anxiously said, "Sister, it's okay here, it's okay here." At the same time, he gestured for her to stop and hide. Xu Huaxie ran while comforting the wounded soldier, saying, "You are like my brother, we must be together, dead or alive." Just then, the enemy plane circled back and started dropping bombs. Xu Huaxie quickly put down the wounded soldier and used her body to shield him. The flying gravel and dust buried her completely. She jumped up, carried the wounded soldier on her back, and ran into the pine forest while the smoke and dust were still there, finally hiding the wounded soldier safely in the pine forest. At this time, the wounded soldier named Ran Hua, a hero who had been wounded three times in the battle but refused to leave the front line and single-handedly eliminated five enemy firing points, a soldier who had never shed a tear in any difficult situation during the war, was moved to tears by Xu Huaxie's noble friendship. Xu Huaxie squatted beside the wounded soldier and silently took out her handkerchief to wipe away his tears.
　　Finally, the enemy planes flew away. Xu Huaxie then found her team members and safely transported the wounded soldier to the rear transfer station. (Chen Su)

　　Brave Korean Children
　　One day in mid-July, the artillery fire on the JinCheng front was fierce. Comrades from the Volunteer Army support-the-front work team suddenly discovered four Korean children in the blockade zone. They had crossed the designated transfer station and were carrying a wounded soldier from the front. The heavy stretcher made them stoop and stagger as they walked. The comrades from the support-the-front work team were both surprised and moved, and they went up to them and advised, "Little brothers, this is a blockade zone, it's very dangerous. After carrying this load, don't come to this place again."
　　The four children stubbornly replied in unison, "We are not afraid. If the Volunteer Army uncles dare to come, then we dare to come. This is our third trip."
　　It was dark. The comrades at the rear treatment center had been busy for several days and nights and were taking a break when suddenly they were informed that wounded soldiers had arrived. Just as the comrades were about to go out to greet them, they saw several children carrying a wounded soldier in. When the comrades learned that these children had carried the wounded soldier from the blockade zone, a feeling of love made them scold the children: "Good brothers, next time you are not allowed to go to the blockade zone again." The children said, "Uncle, please allow us to go. Uncle Luo Shengjiao sacrificed himself to save our Korean children. The Volunteer Army uncles are fighting for us. Can we watch the wounded uncles and not save them?"
　　"Children, you are still young, and it is dangerous to go to the blockade zone."
　　"For the Volunteer Army uncles, we are not afraid of anything," the children stubbornly replied. The comrades at the treatment center quickly arranged for them to rest, but by daybreak, the children were gone again. According to comrades returning from the front, they had encountered four children carrying empty stretchers near the blockade zone. Needless to say, they had gone to the front to rescue the wounded again. The names of these four children are Cui Longzhu, Zhao Xuezhi, Song Zhonggen, and Xu Shifan. (Fang Yatian)

　　A Korean Mother
　　Once, I and Sergeant Ren from our management section returned from purchasing supplies from the motherland. As soon as we passed Andong, it started to rain. On the fourth day, the rain was even heavier, and the car got stuck in the mud and couldn't get out. Our clothes were soaked, and the dry food we brought with us was finished. We had no choice but to take some vermicelli and look for a fire to cook it.
　　We walked five or six li and found a house. We shouted "Ama Ni!" at the door. A Korean mother of about fifty years old came out. When she saw us like this, she immediately led us into the house, took out a few pieces of clothing, and gestured for us to change, and also brought a brazier for us to warm ourselves. She also asked, "Have you eaten?" Sergeant Ren handed her the vermicelli and also took out 200 Korean won. When she saw the money, she was very unhappy and refused for a long time before she accepted it and went to cook with a smile.
　　We hadn't slept well for four days, and we fell asleep as soon as we lay down on the heated kang. When the aunt woke us up, we found that we were covered with quilts. The table on the kang was full of food: rice, stir-fried vermicelli with cabbage and potatoes, and braised dishes. While we were eating, the aunt kept drying our clothes.
　　On the way back, Sergeant Ren took out a cigarette case to smoke, only to find that there were 200 Korean won inside. We were both stunned. Let's go back and give it to her, the car has been driving for more than two hours. He asked me if I remembered her house number, but I only noticed that she had a sign with the surname "Han" hanging on her door. We both regretted not asking her name. Korean mothers love us as much as they love their own children!
(Wang Wenchí)

　　The Wish of Thousands of Soldiers
　　In Tachuli (village), Changdao County, Korea, there is a 21-year-old Korean girl named Shi Jiying. She was the one who had her leg broken by enemy shells while digging wild vegetables to support the Volunteer Army. She was also the one who, after being disabled in one leg, braved the artillery fire to set up a water station for the Volunteer Army soldiers on Shangganling. The noble friendship that Shi Jiying showed to the Volunteer Army soldiers has never been forgotten.
　　"How can we help this girl rebuild her home and restore her peaceful life?" After the ceasefire, the soldiers had just come down from the Shangganling position when they began to discuss this issue. Some people said to build a house for her and settle her down first. But she was the only one left, and she had already joined a family in the neighborhood, so she didn't need a house. Some people said to give her some furniture for work so she could produce, but she only had one leg left, what could she do? The soldiers were all thinking about and worrying about this girl's future life. In the end, everyone agreed that it would be most appropriate to give her a sewing machine. So, thousands of soldiers enthusiastically donated their saved allowances and pooled them together, immediately requesting the superiors to help buy a brand-new sewing machine and send it to Shi Jiying. When Shi Jiying received this sewing machine, which represented the wishes of thousands of soldiers, she was very moved. On the seventh day after the ceasefire, this young girl who had been disabled by American shells began working on the sewing machine. (He Jin)

    中朝人民的兄弟友谊  
    徐花燮冒险救伤员
    六月初的一个雨后初晴的中午，栗洞南山的炮声怒吼着。一个朝鲜妇女徐花燮带领的担架组，正抬着一个重伤员走到大山阳坡的公路上，忽然七架敌机俯冲下来，一阵机枪扫射之后，趁着敌机转圈子，徐花燮连忙叫其他姐妹伏在公路旁的水沟中，她自己便背起伤员往松林里跑。伤员着急地说：“妹妹，这里的行，这里的行。”同时作手势要她停下，躲起来，徐花燮一边跑着，一边安慰伤员说：“你和我的哥哥一样，死活都要在一块。”正在这时，敌机绕过来了，向这里扔起炸弹来，徐花燮急忙把伤员放下，自己用身子遮着，炸起的碎石尘土把她全身都埋住了，她猛地爬起来背起伤员，趁着硝烟尘雾又向松林跑去，终于把伤员背到了松林内隐蔽起来。这时，这个名叫冉华的伤员，这个在方才战斗中三次负伤不下火线只身扫除敌人五个火力点的英雄，这个在战争中任何艰苦情况下不曾落泪的战士，被徐花燮这种崇高的友爱打动得落泪了。徐花燮则蹲在伤员的身旁，一声不响地掏出手绢给他擦眼泪。
    最后，敌机飞走了。徐花燮就找来她的组员，把伤员安全地运到后方转运站。　　（陈　苏）
    勇敢的朝鲜孩子
    七月中旬的一天，金城前线的炮火正紧，志愿军支前工作组的同志们，突然在封锁区发现了四个朝鲜少年儿童，越过了规定的转运站，从前面抬下了一个伤员，沉重的担架压得他们弯着腰，走起来晃晃荡荡的。支前工作组的同志又是惊讶，又是感动地迎上去劝他们说：“小弟弟们，这里是封锁区，很危险，抬了这趟，不要再到这地方来了。”
    四个孩子同声倔强地答道：“我们不怕，志愿军叔叔们敢来，我们也就敢来，我们这是第三趟了。”
    天黑了，后方治疗所的同志们忙碌了几昼夜，正在抓空子休息，突然报告外面来了伤员，同志们刚要出门迎接，只见几个少年儿童抬着一个伤员进来了。当同志们了解到这几个孩子是从封锁区把伤员抬下来的时候，一种疼爱的心情使他们对孩子们责备起来：“好弟弟们，下次不准你们再到封锁区去了。”孩子们说：“叔叔，请允许我们去吧，罗盛教叔叔为抢救我们朝鲜儿童牺牲了，志愿军叔叔为我们打仗，我们能看着负伤的叔叔们不救吗？”
     “孩子们，你们年纪还小，到封锁区是有危险的。”
     “为了志愿军叔叔，我们什么也不怕。”孩子们倔强地回答着。治疗所的同志赶快安排他们休息下来，可是天到拂晓的时候，几个孩子又不见了。据从前沿回来的同志说，在靠近封锁区的地方，曾碰到了四个担着空担架的孩子。不用说，他们又到前面抢救伤员去了。这四个孩子的名字是崔龙洙、赵学智、宋仲根、徐石范。　　　　（房亚田）
    一个朝鲜母亲
    一次，我和我们管理科的任上士从祖国采买回来，一过安东，就下起雨来。第四天，雨下得更大，汽车陷入泥泞里，怎么也开不出来，衣服都湿透了，随身带的干粮也吃完了。我们只好带了一些粉条，去找火煮。
    走了五六里，找到了一户人家。我们在门口喊了一声“阿妈妮！”一个大约五十岁的朝鲜妈妈走了出来，她看到我们这个样子，立刻把我们引到屋里，拿出几件衣服，双手比划着叫我们换，还端火盆给我们烤。又问：“吃过饭吗？”任上士把粉条递给她，还拿出了二百元朝鲜币，她一看给钱，很不高兴，推让了半天，她才收下，带着笑去做饭了。
    我们四天都没有好好睡过觉，一躺在炕上就睡着了。等大娘推醒我们时，才发现身上都盖着被子。炕头上的桌子上摆满了饭菜：大米饭、白菜土豆炒粉条、卤菜。我们吃饭，大妈还在一个劲地给我们烤衣服。
    在归来的路上，任上士拿出烟盒抽烟，才发现里面放着二百元朝鲜币，我们都愣住了。回去送给她吧，汽车已经行驶两小时多了。他问我记不记得她的门牌，可是我只注意到她的门上挂上了个姓“韩”的牌字。我们都很后悔没有问一下她的名字。朝鲜的母亲，像热爱自己的孩子一样热爱着我们！
                                    （王文驰）
    千万个战士的心愿
    在朝鲜仓道郡塔巨里（村），有一个二十一岁的朝鲜姑娘，她的名字叫石吉英，是她，为了挖野菜支援志愿军曾被敌人炮弹打断了一条腿，也是她，在一条腿残废后还冒着炮火为上甘岭的志愿军战士们设立开水站。石吉英对志愿军所表示的这种高贵友谊，战士们一直不能忘记。
      “怎样帮助这个姑娘重建家园恢复她的和平生活呢？”停战以后，战士们刚从上甘岭阵地上下来，便讨论起了这个问题。有人说替她盖房子，先为她安下家。但她只剩下一个人了，并且她已加入了乡邻的一个家庭，房屋她不需要。有人说赠给她一些做活的家具，她好生产，但是她只有一条腿了，能做什么呢？战士们都在为这个姑娘的今后生活思索着，担心着。讨论到最后，大家认为送给她一架缝纫机是最合适的。于是，千百个战士们把自己节省下来的津贴费，踊跃的捐献出来，汇集在一起，立即请求上级帮助，买来了一架崭新的缝纫机给石吉英送去了。当石吉英收到这架代表着千万个战士心意的缝纫机时，她很受感动。停战后的第七天，这位被美国炮弹炸残废了的年青姑娘，便开始在缝纫机上工作了。　　　　　（何　仅）
