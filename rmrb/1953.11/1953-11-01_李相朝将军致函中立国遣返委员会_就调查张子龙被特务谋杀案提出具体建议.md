Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 31st. General Li Xiangzhao wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the afternoon of the 30th, welcoming the investigation into the murder of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner Zhang Zilong by special agents, but at the same time warned that if the control of special agents is not broken first, the investigation will become a farce.

General Li Xiangzhao pointed out: First, if the murderers and suspects of the murder case are not arrested first, and an attempt is made to rely on these murderers to conduct the investigation, it will be fundamentally impossible to find out the truth of the case; second, if all prisoners of war are not evacuated from the camp, a precise investigation cannot be carried out on various evidences or criminal traces left after the destruction of evidence; moreover, allowing special agents to continue to control the camp will not guarantee the safety of investigators and witnesses; third, if prisoners of war are not brought out one by one, witnesses will not be able to accurately identify the murderers, and even if they point out the murderers, it will be difficult to arrest them immediately; fourth, the Korean and Chinese side, as the side to which the victims belong, has the full right to send representatives to participate in the investigation.

General Li Xiangzhao pointed out in his letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission: If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not conduct a serious and effective investigation in accordance with the suggestions put forward by the Korean and Chinese side, it can be predicted that such an investigation will not yield any results even if the witness personnel from the Korean and Chinese side participate.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has notified that the investigation of the special agent murder case of Zhang Zilong will be carried out on the morning of November 1st.

    李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会
    就调查张子龙被特务谋杀案提出具体建议
    【新华社开城三十一日电】李相朝将军在三十日下午写信给中立国遣返委员会，对调查志愿军被俘人员张子龙被特务谋杀案件表示欢迎，但同时提出警告说：如果不首先打破特务控制，调查就将成为一幕滑稽剧。
    李相朝将军指出：第一，如果不首先将谋杀案凶犯及嫌疑犯加以逮捕，而企图依靠这些凶犯来进行调查，就根本不可能查明案件真相；第二，如果不将全部战俘从营场撤清，则对于各项罪证或罪证消灭后遗留的犯罪痕迹就不能进行精密调查；而且让特务分子继续控制营场，调查人员及作证者的安全就不能得到保证；第三，如果不将战俘一一带出，作证者就不可能准确地识别凶犯，即使指出凶犯，也难于立即逮捕；第四，朝中方面为受难者所属一方，完全有权派出代表参与调查。
    李相朝将军在致中立国遣返委员会的信中指出：如果中立国遣返委员会不是按照朝中方面提出的建议认真有效地进行调查，可以预料这样的调查即使有朝中方面的作证人员参加，也将得不到任何结果。
    中立国遣返委员会已通知十一月一日上午进行特务谋杀张子龙案件的调查。
