Many mutual aid teams in Sichuan Province actively sell their surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction and expand agricultural production.

    Before selling grain, mutual aid teams in various regions generally held meetings to discuss the significance of state grain purchases and criticize erroneous ideas such as "hoarding grain for higher prices." The Yang Hua Wan mutual aid team in Lushan Township, Wanxian County, lacked agricultural tools during last year's autumn plowing season. Because the team members wanted to wait for higher prices and were unwilling to sell grain to buy agricultural tools, production suffered. This year, the team members all said: We must not repeat the mistakes of last year. Selling grain to invest in production is beneficial to both the country and ourselves. They actively sold grain to the state and acquired agricultural tools and fertilizers. The Xu Huarong mutual aid team in Taiping Township, Meishan County, through discussion of how this year's grain prices have been reasonably increased and industrial product prices have been appropriately reduced, with one *dan* of rice now buying a *zhang* of blue cloth more than last year, realized that selling grain to the state not only increased their own production capital, but also that as the country's industry develops, they can buy industrial products of better quality and lower prices. They have already sold more than 1,100 *jin* of rice. Under their influence, the Zhao Haiqing mutual aid team also sold more than 2,800 *jin* of grain. Many mutual aid teams realized through discussion that peasants can only resolutely follow the path of mutual aid and cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and actively develop production to gradually move towards a socialist society. Therefore, they sold grain one after another to expand production. The mutual aid team led by Wang Wenxian, a military dependent in Jiangling Township, Daxian County, made a plan to sell grain to expand reproduction. The whole team sold a total of more than 3,100 *jin* of grain. The Rong Dengkai mutual aid team in Datong Township, Qianwei County, with a total of six households, sold 5,225 *jin* of rice to the state. After selling grain to buy means of production, they also formulated a production increase plan, striving to achieve an average wheat yield of 300 *jin* per *mu* next year, and to increase rapeseed production by 10% to 15%.

    四川省许多互助组
    积极卖余粮给国家
    四川省许多互助组积极把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设，并扩大农业生产。
    各地互助组在卖粮以前，一般都召开会议，讨论了国家收购粮食的意义，批判了“存粮等高价”等错误思想。万县鹿山乡杨华万互助组，去年秋耕时缺少农具，由于组员们想等高价，不肯卖粮买农具，使生产受了损失，今年组员们都说：再不要走去年的老路了。卖粮投入生产，对国家、对自己都有好处。他们积极地把粮食卖给国家，添制了农具和肥料。眉山县太平乡徐花容互助组，通过讨论今年粮价合理提高，工业品价格适当降低，一石稻谷比去年要多买丈把蓝布的例子，认识到把粮食卖给国家，不仅自己增加了生产的本钱，同时国家的工业发展了，还能买到质量更好、价格更便宜的工业品。他们已卖出一千一百多斤稻谷。赵海清互助组在他们的带动下，也卖出粮食二千八百多斤。很多互助组通过讨论认识到，农民只有在共产党领导下，坚决走互助合作的道路，积极发展生产，才能一步一步走到社会主义社会。因此，他们纷纷卖粮，扩大生产。达县江陵乡军属王文先领导的互助组，订出卖粮扩大再生产的计划，全组一共卖出粮食三千一百多斤。犍为大同乡荣登楷互助组，共有六户，卖给国家的稻谷有五千二百二十五斤。他们卖粮买了生产资料以后，还订出增产计划，争取明年小麦每亩平均产量达到三百斤，菜籽增产一成到一成半。
