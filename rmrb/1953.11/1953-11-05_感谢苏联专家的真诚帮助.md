Sincere Help from Soviet Experts

Immediate Results from Expert Advice

In the Fushun Steel Plant's production increase and economy drive, the Party and administrative leadership conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and promoted three major advanced methods: the "non-oxidation method," the "power curve," and the improvement of furnace bodies, as well as maintenance methods for electric furnaces. As a result, the time for smelting each furnace of steel was generally reduced by 20% compared to before; steel production increased by 6% to 10%. The electric furnace overhaul time was previously once every 20 smelts, but now it's once every 40 smelts, sometimes reaching 70 smelts before an overhaul. Due to the shortened smelting time, the consumption of alloy materials, electricity, and other auxiliary materials has also decreased compared to before. For example, high-speed steel alone can save more than 60% of raw materials; the quality of various steels produced has also reached the national standards.

"We Can't Work Like Before Anymore"

The working spirit of Comrade Barikin, the Soviet expert who helped us with construction and installation at the 306 construction site, is very touching. On the construction site, with scaffolding 30 meters high, he climbed up and down countless times every day. No matter how hot the weather or how heavy the rain, he never stopped working. One day, it rained heavily, and he was soaked. Everyone advised him to go back and change his clothes, but he said, "It doesn't matter, Soviet people are not made of sugar." He persisted until the work was completed.

Comrade Barikin cherished the workers and public property. He discovered that the voltage of the lights in the boiler workshop was too high and immediately asked the engineer to change it. The engineer replied, "There is no transformer." Barikin said seriously:
"Such high voltage will kill people. Human life is more precious than anything. A transformer can be made immediately, but it takes at least twenty years to cultivate a person." Once, he saw workers burying pipes in concrete and cutting off galvanized pipes to bury them. He immediately asked, "Isn't it a pity to use such good pipes?" The worker said, "There are no other materials, we always used this before." Comrade Barikin ran to every corner of the construction site and found many rusty iron pipes. He sincerely told everyone, "We can't work like before anymore."

Strive for Every Second

During the testing of the kerosene device in a certain installation project, oil leakage was discovered in the air compressor. To repair this problem, a half-millimeter-thick leather pad was needed, but it couldn't be found on the spot, nor was it in the warehouse. The Soviet expert Comrade Belov was about to cut off the "tongue" of his new leather shoe that he brought from Moscow. The employees present at the time all stopped him from doing so, but Comrade Belov said, "Going to a leather shop temporarily will affect the progress of the project and easily cause accidents. Every second of building the country is precious." (Wen Shan)

Relieved from the Pain of Fire and Smoke

In a certain coke oven in the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, fire extinguishing and coke transportation were manual labor in the past. For fifteen years, the workers suffered from the heat, fire and smoke. After examining all the equipment in the coking department, the Soviet expert Comrade Semisalov believed that as long as the furnace platform of this coke oven was removed, the adjacent fire extinguishing machine could be driven over to replace manual labor. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant organized more than 700 people to carry out this project. Expert Comrade Semisalov personally guided the construction. After 18 hours, the mechanized fire extinguishing machine was driven over from the newly laid railway tracks, and the coke fire extinguishing of the coke oven was mechanized. The employees of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant excitedly said that Soviet expert Comrade Semisalov helped us convert a coke oven using manual labor into mechanized equipment in 18 hours, freeing us from the pain of fire and smoke. We will never forget the help of Comrade Semisalov.

Innovation that Reduces Labor Intensity

In the steel ingot mold team of the casting department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the old sand casting method was used in the past, which was costly, had low output and quality, and had poor production conditions. The workers who screened the sand had blood blisters on their hands and had little rest time. Since Soviet expert Comrade Sheryokin helped them change this old sand casting method and adopted the "multi-casting method with one mold" (also known as the "hundred-casting method with one mold"), the past situation has been completely changed. Not only has the labor intensity of the workers been reduced, and 20% of the labor force has been reduced, but also it has guaranteed the monthly over fulfillment of the task, and the product quality has also been improved, saving a lot of core iron and other materials. According to preliminary statistics, the steel ingot mold team can save and create more than 638.88 million yuan of wealth for the country this year, and can complete the annual production task 54 days ahead of schedule. (Niu Fenghe)

This is a Truly Advanced Plan

When the Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory formulated the production target for 1957, the original plan was to increase the maximum annual output by 270% compared to this year. However, according to the plan, the state would have to invest more than 80 billion yuan to increase equipment and personnel... They believed that this plan was already very advanced; however, after soliciting the opinions of Soviet experts, the Soviet experts believed that this plan was conservative and backward. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, as long as some equipment is added on the existing basis, and technical improvements are made, the production requirements for 1957 can be approached by 1954.

Soviet experts pointed out that the water mixing molding method used for grinding wheel forming is not used in the Soviet Union as early as 1934. After changing the water mixing molding method to the squeezing method, the drying time for making a 750 mm diameter grinding wheel is shortened from fifteen days to two days.

Due to the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, the kiln firing time was shortened from 168 hours to 85 hours, greatly improving the equipment utilization rate; the refractory material manufacturing workshop applied this advanced kiln firing method to the kilns for firing refractory materials, and the kiln firing time was also shortened from 156 hours to 88 hours. At the same time, the scrap rate was reduced from 25% to 7%, and fuel (coal) can be saved by more than 20%, and these achievements are only preliminary. This made the leading cadres of Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory suddenly realize that the original plan was not an advanced plan. Only by studying the suggestions of Soviet experts can the potential strength of the factory be truly explored and a truly advanced production plan can be formulated.

Not a Small Matter

When Soviet experts first arrived at the 21st Engineering Company, they first started to check the on-site security equipment. They checked very carefully, every wire joint, every switch, and every circuit breaker were checked. At that time, some employees were very strange, they said: "Why do Soviet experts only pay attention to 'small things'?" The facts checked out by the experts answered their doubts. Soviet expert Seminirning found that many circuit breakers on the construction site were not covered with fuse boxes. He immediately suggested to the responsible cadres of the construction site to strengthen security equipment, and explained to the workers: "It is very dangerous for circuit breakers to be exposed. Workers often carry iron bars through here. If the iron bars accidentally hit the circuit breakers, personal injuries and deaths will occur." He also earnestly admonished the employees: "Building the motherland needs people and machines. Machines are made by people, but machines cannot make people. People are the most valuable property." This educated the employees of the construction site very deeply. The workers said: In the past, we only paid attention to big places, not small places, and as a result, small problems often caused major accidents. What Soviet experts pay attention to is not a small matter! (Wen Shan)

The Expert's Help is Countless

The help given to the Welding Steel Pipe Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel by Soviet expert Comrade Korotkov is countless. He helped the factory solve the problem of backlog of semi-finished products in the finishing process; established a process inspection system to improve the welding quality of steel pipes; modified the pipe drawing die to strengthen the welding strength of steel pipes; modified the blow nozzle to ensure the quality of the products; changed the chemical composition of the tube blank to increase carbon and reduce heating time; especially after the implementation of the "continuous rhythm operation method with fewer pieces installed" proposed by the expert, the output and quality have been further improved. The average output has increased by 9%, and the quality has increased by 4.3%, creating huge wealth for the country, and laying a solid foundation for completing this year's production plan. The workers of the factory wrote a letter to Comrade Korotkov, unanimously expressing: "We must resolutely implement your suggestions, create more wealth for the country, and ensure the completion of the production increase and economy drive tasks to thank you for your help."

    感谢苏联专家的真诚帮助
    立竿见影的专家建议
    抚顺钢厂在增产节约竞赛中，党和行政的领导方面认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，推行了“不氧化法”、“电力曲线”和改进炉体等熔炼操作法和维护电炉办法等三种重大的先进方法以后，熔炼每一炉钢的时间一般比以前缩短了百分之二十；钢的产量比以前增加了百分之六到百分之十。电炉检修时间过去是熔炼二十炉检修一次，现在熔炼四十炉检修一次，有时达到七十炉才检修一次。由于熔炼时间的缩短，合金料、电力和其他辅助材料的消耗也比以前降低了，其中只锋钢一项，就可节省原料百分之六十以上；炼出的各种钢的质量也达到了国家规定的标准。
    “不能再像从前那样工作了”
    在三○六工地帮助我们建筑安装的苏联专家巴里金同志的工作精神是非常感动人的。工地上矗立着三十公尺高的脚手架，他每天不知要爬上爬下多少次，不论天气多么热或者下雨，他都没有停止工作，有一天雨下得很大，他淋得满身是水，大家劝他回去穿衣服，他说：“不要紧，苏联人不是糖作的。”一直坚持到工作完毕。
    巴里金同志非常爱护工人，爱护公共财物。他发现锅炉车间电灯电压太高，马上找工程师改换。工程师回答：“没有变压器。”巴里金严肃地说：
  “这样高的电压会打死人的，人的生命比一切都宝贵，变压器马上可以造出来，可是一个人至少要培养二十年。”有一次他看到工人正在混凝土中埋设管子，把镀锌管截断埋进去了，马上问：“这样好的管子不可惜吗？”工人说：“再没有别的材料，以前总是用这个。”巴里金同志跑到工地各个角落去找，结果找到了很多生锈的铁管子，他诚恳地告诉大家说：“不能再像从前那样工作了。”
    争取一分一秒的时间
    在某项安装工程中试验瓦油装置时，发现了空气压缩机漏油。要修理这个毛病必须要用半粍厚的皮垫才行，可是当场又找不到，仓库里也没有。苏联专家别洛夫同志就要把他从莫斯科穿来的新皮鞋的“舌头”割下来。当时在场的职工都阻止他这样做，但是别洛夫同志说：“临时到皮铺去买，既影响工程进度，又容易造成事故。建设国家一分一秒的时间都是宝贵的。”　　（文珊）
    从此免除了火烤烟熏的痛苦
    太原钢铁厂炼焦部某号炼焦炉，过去出焦时消火、运焦，都是人工劳动。十五年来，工人受尽了火烤烟熏的苦处。苏联专家谢米萨洛夫同志察看了炼焦部的全部设备后，认为只要把这个焦炉的炉台拆除，邻近的消火机就能开过来代替人力的劳动。太原钢铁厂组织了七百余人进行这一工程，专家谢米萨洛夫同志亲自指导施工，经过十八个小时，机械化的消火机已从新铺的铁轨上开过来了，焦炉的出焦消火已经机械化了。太原钢铁厂炼焦部的职工们兴奋地说，苏联专家谢米萨洛夫同志帮助我们在十八个钟头内把一部用手工劳动的炼焦炉改装成机械化的设备，使我们从此免除了火烤烟熏的痛苦，我们永远不会忘记谢米萨洛夫同志的帮助。
    减轻劳动强度的革新
    石景山钢铁厂铸造部钢锭模小组，过去用旧的翻砂操作方法，成本高，产量、质量低，而且生产条件不好，筛砂的工人们手上都磨起了血泡，休息时间很少。自从苏联专家谢辽金同志帮助他们改变了这个旧的翻砂方法，采用了“一模多铸法”（又叫一模百铸法）后，完全改变了过去那种情况，不仅减轻了工人的劳动强度，减少了百分之二十的劳动力，且保证每月超额完成任务，产品质量也提高了，节省了很多芯铁和其他材料。据初步统计，钢锭模小组今年全年可给国家节省和创造六亿三千八百八十多万元的财富，并能提前五十四天完成全年生产任务。　（牛凤和）
    这才是真正先进的计划
    苏家屯砂轮厂拟订一九五七年的生产指标时，原定最高年产量将比今年提高百分之二百七十。但根据计划，必须要求国家再投资八百余亿元，增加设备，增加人员……。他们认为这个计划已经很先进了；可是征求了苏联专家的意见后，苏联专家却认为这个计划是保守的、落后的。按照苏联专家的意见，只要在现有基础上增加一些设备，再从技术上加以改进，到一九五四年便可接近一九五七年产量的要求。
    苏联专家指出，现在砂轮成型采用的水搅拌成型法，在苏联早在一九三四年就不用了。将水搅拌成型法改为压榨法后，做七百五十粍直径的砂轮，干燥时间就由十五天缩短到两天。
    由于执行了苏联专家的建议，烧窑时间即由一百六十八小时缩短为八十五小时，大大提高了设备运用率；耐火材料制造车间把这种先进的烧窑法运用到烧制耐火材料的窑上，烧窑时间也由一百五十六小时缩短为八十八小时，同时废品率由百分之二十五降低到百分之七，还可以节约燃料（煤）百分之二十以上，而且这些成绩还仅仅是初步的。这一来苏家屯砂轮厂领导干部才恍然大悟，认识到原来的计划并非先进计划，只有研究了苏联专家这些建议，才能真正发掘工厂的潜在力量，订出真正先进的生产计划。
    不是小事
    苏联专家刚到二十一工程公司，首先着手检查现场的保安设备，他们检查得很细致，每一个电线接头，每一个开关，每一个电闸都进行了检查，当时有些职工很奇怪，他们说：“苏联专家怎么只注意‘小事’呢？”专家检查出来的事实，回答了他们的怀疑。苏联专家谢敏尔宁发现该工地有很多电闸都没有保险箱罩着，他马上向该工地负责干部建议，要加强保安设备，并向工人讲解：“电闸露在外边很危险，工人们经常扛着铁筋从这里经过，万一不小心铁筋碰在电闸上，就会发生人身伤亡事故。”他还谆谆告诫职工：“建设祖国需要人和机器，机器是人造的，但是机器不能造人，人是最宝贵的财产。”这对该工地的职工教育很深，工人们都说：过去我们只注意大地方，不注意小地方，结果常常因为一点小毛病，造成大事故。苏联专家注意的原来不是小事！　（文珊）
    专家的帮助是数不完的
    苏联专家科罗特扣夫同志给予鞍钢焊接钢管厂的帮助是数不完的。他帮助厂里解决了精整工序半成品积压问题；建立了工序检查制度，提高了钢管焊接质量；修改了拉管模，加强了钢管焊接强度；修改了吹风咀子，保证了产品质量；改变了管坯化学成份，提高了炭素，减少了加热时间；特别是执行了专家提出的“少装片数连续节奏操作法”以后，产量和质量更加提高了，平均产量提高了百分之九，质量提高了百分之四点三，给国家创造了巨大财富，给完成今年生产计划打下了有力基础。该厂工人特向科罗特扣夫同志写信，一致表示：“我们一定要坚决贯彻你的建议，给国家创造更多的财富，保证完成增产节约任务，来感谢你对我们的帮助。”
