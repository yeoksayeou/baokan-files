    The 1953 National Folk Sports Performance and Competition Meeting solemnly opened in Tianjin on the morning of the 8th.
    Various colorful flags fluttered around the meeting venue. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the rostrum. Opposite the rostrum stood huge inscriptions of Chairman Mao's "Develop sports and improve the people's physique" and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's "Popularize people's sports to serve production and national defense."
    Among those attending the opening ceremony were Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee; Li Dequan, Minister of Health; Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee; Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Sports Commission; Zhang Zhen, member of the Sports Commission; Ma John, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation; Dong Shouyi, member of the All-China Sports Federation. Also present were Huang Huoqing, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Wu De, Mayor of Tianjin; Zhou Shutao, Deputy Mayor; Li Gengtao, Director of the Sports Commission; and responsible persons from various organs and organizations in Tianjin, as well as over 10,000 people from all walks of life in Tianjin.
    Zarkov, Deputy Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Tianjin, Balewa, Acting Consul of the Polish Consulate in Tianjin, and others were also invited to attend.
    At 9:30 a.m., the athletes began their march-in amidst military music. The majestic People's Liberation Army delegation, the railway delegation, and the athletes from the Inner Mongolian grasslands were followed by the Northeast delegation from China's industrial base, the Northwest delegation composed of Han, Hui, Uygur, Kazakh, Tatar, and Mongolian ethnic groups, and the delegations from Northeast, Central South, Southwest, and North China. Finally, PLA and Inner Mongolian athletes rode dozens of steeds, passing the rostrum with heroic posture.
    Wu De, Chairman of the conference, announced the official opening of the conference. On behalf of the presidium of the conference and the people of Tianjin, he extended a warm welcome to all athletes and sports workers. He said: The reason why such a grand performance and competition meeting can be held is due to the care and advocacy of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao for sports, the emphasis on national sports, and the unprecedented unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The purpose of this conference is to sort out and study national sports, absorb its essence, eliminate its dross, and gradually promote and popularize it, so that it can become a scientific sports project loved by the broad masses of the people, serving the people's health and serving the country's economic construction and national defense construction.
    Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, spoke amidst warm applause. He said: National sports is a part of our country's cultural heritage, created by the broad masses of our people in labor and struggle. It has a strong national style and has become a method of physical exercise loved by the broad masses of working people. Some of the excellent projects have a long history, and are still widely spread in the vast rural and urban areas. However, in the past feudal society, like other cultural heritages, it was inevitably tainted with feudal colors to a greater or lesser extent. Certain projects of national sports were also inevitably stained with conservative, backward, mysterious, and metaphysical colors to a greater or lesser extent. This is like a layer of dirt covering a shining pearl. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, seriously sort out national sports, develop the part that is beneficial to the people's health, and eliminate the part that is not in line with science. Vice Premier Guo also called on the athletes to unite closely, observe and learn from each other; better study politics, understand and abide by national policies, transform their thinking and style, so that national sports can play its due role for the people's health, for the country's industrialization and the modernization of national defense.

    民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会在天津开幕
    据新华社讯：一九五三年全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会，于八日上午在天津市隆重开幕。
    大会会场四周飘扬着各种鲜艳的旗帜，主席台的中央，悬挂着毛主席的巨像。主席台的对面，耸立着毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”和朱总司令“普及人民体育运动，为生产和国防服务”的巨幅题词。
    出席开幕式的有中央人民政府政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若，卫生部部长李德全，文化教育委员会秘书长钱俊瑞，体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠，委员张轸，中华全国体育总会副主席马约翰、委员董守义。还有中国共产党天津市委员会书记黄火青，天津市人民政府市长吴德、副市长周叔弢，体育运动委员会主任李耕涛及天津市各机关、团体负责人，天津市各界人民共一万多人。
    苏联驻津总领事馆副领事扎尔柯夫，波兰驻津领事馆代理领事巴列瓦等多人也应邀出席。
    上午九时半在军乐声中运动员开始举行入场式。雄壮的解放军代表队，铁路代表队，来自内蒙古草原的运动员的队伍，随后是来自我国工业基地的东北代表队，由汉、回、维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔、蒙族等民族组成的西北代表队以及东北、中南、西南、华北的代表队。最后，解放军和内蒙古运动员骑着数十匹骏马，以英武的姿态走过主席台。
    大会主席吴德宣布大会正式开幕。他代表大会主席团和天津市人民向全体运动员和体育工作者表示热烈欢迎。他说：这样盛大的表演和竞赛大会之所以能够举行，是由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席对体育运动的关怀和倡导，对民族形式体育的重视，以及我国各民族人民的空前团结一致。这次大会的目的就在于整理研究民族形式体育，吸取其精华，剔除其糟粕，逐步地予以提倡和推广，使之成为科学的、为广大人民所爱好的体育项目，为人民健康服务，为祖国的经济建设和国防建设服务。
    中央人民政府政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若在热烈掌声中讲话。他说：民族形式体育是我国文化遗产的一部分，是我国广大人民在劳动和战斗中创造出来的。它具有浓厚的民族风格，而成为广大劳动人民所喜爱的锻炼身体的方法。其中有好些优秀的项目，有长远的历史，而且在目前在广大的农村和城市中也还相当广泛地流传着。但是，在过去的封建社会里面，就和其他的文化遗产都不免或多或少地带上了封建色彩一样，民族形式体育的某些项目，也不免或多或少地染上了保守、落后、神秘、玄虚的色彩。这正像光辉的珍珠上蒙上了一层污泥。因此我们必须遵照毛主席的指示，对于民族形式体育认真地加以整理，发挥其有益于人民健康的部分，剔除其不合于科学的部分。郭副总理并号召运动员们亲密地团结起来，互相观摩，互相学习；更好地学习政治，体会和遵守国家政策，改造思想和作风，使民族形式体育为人民健康，为祖国的工业化和国防的现代化发挥它应有的作用。
