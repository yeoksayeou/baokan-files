Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 1st: Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, received a copy of the investigation report from the Fourth Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team sent to the Uiju Airport on October 30th. This investigation report, jointly signed by personnel from four neutral nations, proves that the US side's allegations that the Korean-Chinese side transported reinforcing combat aircraft into Uiju Airport in crates are completely unfounded fabrications. The investigation report stated: "The scope of this inspection and observation included the entire airport. The team had free access to all areas. These observations were conducted by jeep on October 15th and October 21st, with detailed inspections conducted on foot."
    The investigation report stated: "The results of the inspection and observation are as follows: 1. We saw: The entire airport, the perimeter of the airport, the runway, taxiways, open spaces, aircraft shelters, some of which were empty, some with camouflaged fighter jets and other aircraft, some with aircraft that were obviously damaged during the war, various facilities, and air-raid shelters for personnel, all of which were empty. 2. We did not see: Any crates used for transporting aircraft or suitable for transporting aircraft or disassembled crates, any unassembled aircraft, any equipment specifically used for assembling aircraft, any indications that aircraft or aircraft parts may have been transported from Manchuria via road, rail, or air."
    The conclusion of the investigation report stated: "The Fourth Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team, as a result of its observation and inspection in Uiju, did not find any evidence to prove that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers violated Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcing combat aircraft from Manchuria into the Uiju Airport in Korea in crates."
    The complete bankruptcy of the US side's accusations further powerfully proves that the reason the US side made these baseless accusations was to cover up its own actions of violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcing war materials into South Korea in crates.

    派赴义州的中立国机动视察小组的调查报告证明
    美方关于我方运入作战飞机的指控纯系捏造
   【新华社开城一日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，在十月三十日收到派赴义州机场的第四机动中立国视察小组的调查报告的副本。这一由四个中立国人员共同签署的调查报告证明：美方提出的据说是朝中方面把增援性的作战飞机装箱运入义州机场的指控，完全是毫无根据的捏造。调查报告说：“这次视察与观察的范围包括整个飞机场。本小组到各个地方都可自由出入。这次观察是在十月十五日和十月二十一日乘吉普车进行的，在作详细视察时则徒步。”
    调查报告说：“视察和观察的结果如下：一、看到：整个飞机场，飞机场的周界，飞机跑道，滑行道，空地，飞机避弹处，其中有些是空的，有些停着带有伪装的战斗机和其他飞机，有些停着显然是在战争期间被破坏了的飞机，各种设备，人用的防空洞，都是空的。二、没有看到：任何用于装运飞机或是适于装运飞机的箱子或拆散的箱子，任何没有装配起来的飞机，任何专为用来装配飞机的设备，任何表明可能从满洲经公路、铁路或空路运来飞机或飞机零件的迹象。”
    调查报告的结论指出：“第四机动中立国视察小组在义州观察和视察的结果，并未发现任何证据足以证明朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军违反停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，由满洲将增援性的作战飞机装箱运入朝鲜义州机场。”
    美方这种指控的彻底破产，更加有力地证明了美方所以毫无根据地提出这种指控，其目的就是为了掩盖它自己违反停战协定把增援性的作战物资装箱运入南朝鲜的行为。
