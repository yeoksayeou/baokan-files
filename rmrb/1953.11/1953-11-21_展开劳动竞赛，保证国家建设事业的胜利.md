Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, cadres and workers in factories, mines, and transportation enterprises across the country have enthusiastically responded to this call, formulated their own plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and widely launched labor emulation drives to ensure the completion of these plans. This nationwide mass campaign to increase production and practice economy foreshadows the complete victory of the first annual plan of our country's Five-Year Plan.

However, it should be pointed out that some leading cadres of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises believe that labor emulation and increasing production and practicing economy are contradictory. They believe that they are already too busy with increasing production and practicing economy and have no energy to organize labor emulation. Obviously, this understanding is extremely wrong. Because to achieve the goals of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, tap production potential, and increase labor productivity. And labor emulation is precisely a mass "movement" for increasing production and practicing economy, that is, a mass "movement" for tapping production potential and increasing labor productivity. Of course, the so-called "movement" here is not a concentrated or temporary "movement" like the democratic reform period, but should be a regular, continuous, and mass production activity.

This year's labor emulation has made many progress compared with previous years. The most important point is that the blindness has been reduced and the planning has been strengthened. Many factories, mines, and transportation enterprises have begun to implement planned management and implement operation plans (plans for increasing production and practicing economy are also incorporated into operation plans), thereby giving the competition a clear goal. Some factories, mines, and transportation enterprises, based on the production plan, formulate organizational measures plans and mobilize the masses to solve key problems in production, which makes the masses' rationalization proposals have a clear goal, rather than being scattered and disorganized. The combination of labor emulation with rationalization proposals and the promotion of advanced experience not only highly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses, but also highly stimulated the creativity of the masses. The development of labor emulation has also promoted the progress of enterprise management, especially making the plans and various indicators of enterprises gradually closer to reality and more accurate.

It can be seen that labor emulation and planned management are not contradictory, but complementary. Some leading cadres of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises mistakenly believe that they are already too busy with planned management and have no energy to organize labor emulation. This understanding must also be corrected.

Labor emulation is the most important condition for achieving the goals of increasing production and practicing economy and implementing planned management. Increasing production and practicing economy without labor emulation and planned management without labor emulation are both unimaginable.

Labor emulation is the basic method for improving labor productivity, and therefore it is also the basic method for our national construction.

After the working class gained the leading position in the country, with the improvement of the awareness of the working masses, labor emulation gradually developed. This competition is an unstoppable manifestation of the conscious labor enthusiasm of the working masses. When the leading cadres of our enterprises do not yet have experience in leading labor emulation, this competition is spontaneous. Therefore, in its initial stage, it inevitably focuses on strengthening labor intensity and rush work. Precisely because of this, in the initial labor emulation, output generally increased, but the phenomena of low quality, many defective products, high costs, and many accidents were common. But we should never deny labor emulation because of this; the problem is to strengthen its leadership, to make spontaneous labor emulation a labor emulation with leadership, planning, and organization; to make rush labor emulation a regular and continuous labor emulation.

At present, factories, mines, and transportation enterprises where labor emulation is proceeding more normally can generally achieve the regularization of competition, and the content of the competition is to ensure the completion of the operation plan. The labor emulation of some factories and mines (such as some units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company) has become a powerful lever for the progress of the entire enterprise. Its characteristic is that it pays great attention to the improvement of production technology and labor organization. We should require all enterprises and units to launch labor emulation to ensure the completion of the operation plan; we should also require all enterprises and units to launch mass rationalization proposals, striving to make improvements in production technology and labor organization. If we truly pay attention to the combination of labor emulation with rationalization proposals and the promotion of advanced experience, and pay attention to the combination of labor emulation with the implementation of planned management, labor emulation can move forward.

Can we say that the above requirements are too high for "backward" areas or "backward" industries? No, we cannot. Because after the basic completion of democratic reform in enterprises, most enterprises and units in all regions and all industries across the country have the conditions to truly turn to production. From this point of view, the work of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises across the country is gradually tending to balance. Of course, this is not to deny the imbalance in the work of various factories, mines, and transportation enterprises, but to say that this imbalance is an imbalance at the same stage of development. Democratic reforms have been basically completed, and all forces can be concentrated on production, that is, all enterprises and units are basically in the same stage of development, which is tending to balance. However, in terms of enterprise management, labor emulation, etc., some are more advanced and some are more backward, which is unbalanced. This imbalance will always exist, and this imbalance is normal. Precisely because there is this imbalance, it is necessary to promote advanced experience to drive the backward with the advanced, and we must never refuse to promote advanced experience because of this imbalance. Therefore, the above requirements are not too high for "backward" areas or "backward" industries either.

Combine labor emulation with planned management, rationalization proposals, and the promotion of advanced experience, so that it becomes a regular labor method for the masses, highly stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, technicians, and staff, constantly tap production potential, improve production technology and labor organization, so as to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce product costs, improve the operating environment, and ensure production safety. This should be the direction of current labor emulation.

Finally, it must be pointed out that in the leadership of labor emulation, correct reward policies must not be ignored. Without correct rewards, there will be no sustained competition. Spiritual and material rewards must be given in a timely manner for the creations, inventions, and various major contributions of employees. On the basis of developing production, the material and cultural life of the staff and workers must be gradually improved according to needs and possibilities. Sincerely caring for the lives of the masses and tirelessly conducting communist education for the masses will enable the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to be fully developed.

Leading labor emulation is not only the responsibility of trade union organizations, but also the responsibility of enterprise party committees and enterprise administrative leadership. Constantly advancing labor emulation will surely guarantee the complete victory of the national construction cause.

### 展开劳动竞赛，保证国家建设事业的胜利

    展开劳动竞赛，保证国家建设事业的胜利
    自从中共中央发出了增产节约的号召之后，全国各厂、矿、交通企业的干部和工人都热烈地响应了这个号召，制订了自己的增产节约计划，并广泛地展开了劳动竞赛，来保证这些计划的完成。这一全国普遍的增产节约劳动竞赛，预示着我国五年建设计划的第一个年度计划的完全胜利。
    可是应当指出，也有一些厂、矿、交通企业的领导干部认为：劳动竞赛和增产节约是矛盾着的。他们认为增产节约已经忙不过来了，再没有精力来组织劳动竞赛。显然，这种认识是极端错误的。因为要达到增产节约的目的，必须发动群众，集中群众的智慧，发掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率。而劳动竞赛，正是群众性的增产节约“运动”，也就是群众性的发掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率的“运动”。当然，这里所谓“运动”，不是像民主改革时期那样的突击性的或一个时期的“运动”，而应当是经常的持续的群众性的生产活动。
    今年的劳动竞赛比之往年，有了很多进步，其中最主要的一点，就是盲目性减少了，计划性增强了。许多厂、矿、交通企业开始实行了计划管理，贯彻了作业计划（增产节约计划也编入了作业计划），因而使竞赛有了明确的目标。有些厂、矿、交通企业，根据生产计划作出组织措施计划，发动群众来解决生产中的关键问题，更使群众的合理化建议有了明确的目标，而不是散乱无组织的。劳动竞赛和合理化建议和推广先进经验结合进行，就不但高度地发挥了群众的积极性，也高度地发挥了群众的创造性。劳动竞赛的开展，还促进了企业管理的进步，特别是使企业的计划和各种指标逐渐地更加接近实际，更加准确起来。
    由此可见劳动竞赛和计划管理也是不矛盾的，而是相因相成的。有一些厂、矿、交通企业的领导干部，错误地认为计划管理已经忙不过来了，再没有精力来组织劳动竞赛。这种认识也必须加以纠正。
    劳动竞赛是达到增产节约目的和实行计划管理的最重要的条件，离开劳动竞赛的增产节约和离开劳动竞赛的计划管理都是不可想像的。
    劳动竞赛是提高劳动生产率的基本方法，因而也就是我们国家建设的基本方法。
    当工人阶级获得了国家的领导地位之后，随着工人群众觉悟程度的提高，劳动竞赛就逐步地开展起来了。这种竞赛，是工人群众自觉的劳动热情的一种不可遏制的表现。当我们企业的领导干部还没有领导劳动竞赛的经验的时候，这种竞赛是带有自发性的。所以它的初期阶段，不可避免地是偏重于加强劳动强度的和突击性的。正因为这样，所以在初期的劳动竞赛中，产量一般都增加了，而质量低、废品多、成本高、事故多的现象却是普遍的。可是绝不应该因此就否定劳动竞赛；问题是要加强对于它的领导，使自发的劳动竞赛成为有领导、有计划、有组织的劳动竞赛；使突击性的劳动竞赛成为经常的持续性的劳动竞赛。
    目前劳动竞赛比较正常进行的厂、矿、交通企业，一般可以作到竞赛经常化，而竞赛的内容则是保证作业计划的完成。有一些厂矿（如鞍山钢铁公司的某些单位）的劳动竞赛，已经成为整个企业前进的有力杠杆，其特点是十分注意生产技术和劳动组织的改进。我们应当要求各个企业单位展开劳动竞赛，来保证作业计划的完成；同时也应当要求各个企业单位展开群众性的合理化建议，力求在生产技术和劳动组织方面有所改进。如果真正注意了劳动竞赛和合理化建议和推广先进经验相结合，注意了劳动竞赛和实行计划管理相结合，劳动竞赛就可以前进一步。
    可不可以说上述这些，对于“落后”地区或“落后”产业是过高的要求呢？不可以的。因为在企业民主改革基本上结束之后，全国所有地区和所有产业的大部分企业单位，都有条件确实转向生产。从这一方面来说，全国厂、矿、交通企业的工作是逐渐趋向平衡的。当然这并不是否认各个厂、矿、交通企业工作的不平衡，而是说这种不平衡是在同一发展阶段的不平衡。民主改革大体上都完成了，就都可以把力量集中到生产上来了，即各企业单位大体上处于同一个发展阶段，这就是趋向平衡。可是在企业管理、劳动竞赛等方面，则有的先进一些，有的落后一些，这是不平衡。这种不平衡是永远会存在的，这种不平衡是正常的。正因为有这种不平衡，所以必须推广先进经验，以先进来带动落后，而绝不能由于有这种不平衡而拒绝推广先进经验。所以上述要求对于“落后”地区或“落后”产业也并不是过高的。
    把劳动竞赛和计划管理、合理化建议、推广先进经验结合起来，使它成为群众经常的劳动方式，高度地发挥工人、技术人员和职员的积极性和创造性，不断地发掘生产潜力，改进生产技术和劳动组织，以提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量、降低产品成本，改善操作环境，保证生产安全。这应当是目前劳动竞赛的方向。
    最后必须指出，在劳动竞赛的领导上，绝不可以忽视正确的奖励政策。没有正确的奖励就不会有持续性的竞赛。对于职工群众的创造、发明和各种重大贡献，都必须及时地予以精神的和物质的奖励。必须在发展生产的基础上，根据需要和可能，逐步地改善职工群众的物质生活和文化生活。亲切地关怀群众生活，不疲倦地对群众进行共产主义教育，群众的积极性和创造性就能够充分地发挥起来。
    领导劳动竞赛，这不仅是工会组织的责任，同时是企业党委和企业行政领导方面的责任。不断地把劳动竞赛向前推进，就一定可以保证国家建设事业的完全胜利。
