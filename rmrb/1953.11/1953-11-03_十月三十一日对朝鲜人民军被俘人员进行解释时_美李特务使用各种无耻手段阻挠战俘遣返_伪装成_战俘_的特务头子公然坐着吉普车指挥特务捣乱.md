Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 2nd: During the first explanation to captured personnel of the Korean People's Army on October 31st, the US-Li Syngman secret agents spared no effort to obstruct the explanation work, threaten prisoners of war, and prevent them from being repatriated.

On that day, the Li Syngman gang's secret agents mixed among the prisoners of war went from one explanation tent to another, pretending to listen to the explanation, creating disturbances, and delaying time in order to deprive the prisoners of war who should have listened to the explanation of their rights. Such situations were found in explanation tents numbered 6, 11, 12, 13, and 17. On the afternoon of that day, after an explanation session in tent number 6, when the Korean-Chinese explanation representatives came out of the tent to rest, they saw a "prisoner of war" shouting and yelling wildly in tent number 12. It turned out to be the thirteenth "prisoner of war" who had listened to the explanation in tent number 6. In tent number 11, when a "prisoner of war" was cursing the explanation representative, he inadvertently said, "You don't need to speak, I have already listened in another tent today!"

Twenty-one captured personnel who returned after the explanation said that they had been severely threatened by secret agents from the camp field to the explanation tent to listen to the explanation. When they came out to listen to the explanation that day, Zhuo Wulie, the secret agent battalion commander of camp field number 35, himself took the lead in front. After he entered the explanation tent and made a lot of noise, he came out and patrolled back and forth in a jeep of the Indian troops. Zhang Rixi, a returning person, encountered him five times in the waiting tent for two hundred and fifty people, the waiting tent for twenty-five people, and near the explanation enclosure. Every time, Zhuo Wulie fiercely frightened the prisoners of war, telling them that no one had applied for repatriation, that the explanation representatives had been beaten, and so on. In addition, some secret agents who had already listened to the explanation shouted wildly in the enclosure to those who had not yet listened to the explanation, telling them how to raid the explanation representatives. Wen Changzhu, a returning person, said, "In this atmosphere, who wouldn't be afraid? Everyone saw that the battalion commander was still so imposing in the explanation place. Even people like me who had decided to return to the Republic didn't dare to apply for repatriation for a long time after entering the explanation tent."

The situation inside the explanation tent also fully demonstrated the serious impact of the long-term deception and intimidation of prisoners of war by secret agents. Many people entered the tent and muttered, "Let you speak for five minutes," "Let you speak for five minutes." This was obviously because the secret agents told them that each person could only listen to five minutes of explanation. The prisoners of war who entered tent number 6 shouted like sleepwalkers: "I already know that if you go out from the back door (i.e., the door for applying for repatriation), you will be killed!" "In three months, the United Nations forces will kill all those held in the willing-to-be-repatriated camps!" Many prisoners of war obviously did not dare to apply for repatriation because they believed what the secret agents told them.

In the explanation tent, the US "observer representatives" or "translators" who were originally Chiang Kai-shek gang's secret agents were replaced by Li Syngman's secret agents. They, together with the US representatives, openly used extremely despicable and shameless means to coerce the prisoners of war during the explanation. As soon as the prisoners of war entered the explanation tent, these so-called "representatives" and "translators" from the US stared at the faces of the prisoners of war, using eye contact and gestures to warn the prisoners of war that they must go out from the door of "not yet applied for repatriation." When the prisoners of war did not make noise and quietly listened to the explanation, they deliberately coughed loudly to intimidate the prisoners of war. In the fifth explanation tent, when the explanation representative spoke to a prisoner of war, the prisoner of war began to make noise. Then he covered his ears with both hands, pretending not to listen. Later, his hands slowly moved to the bottom of his ears, secretly listening to the explanation representative's speech. At this time, the US "observer representative" noticed it and deliberately coughed loudly, immediately scaring the prisoner of war into shouting loudly again. This US "representative" made a lot of unreasonable "opinions" and "protests" almost after every explanation, saying that the Korean-Chinese explanation representatives mentioned "the names of prisoners of war who have applied for repatriation," "the Korean-Chinese side can give prisoners of war ninety days of explanation," "the Korean people have won," and so on, all of which violated the agreement. Although his unreasonable disturbances were opposed by the chairman of the subsidiary body, he continued to make trouble six times in the morning. The US's undisguised delaying tactics annoyed the chairman of the subsidiary body. The chairman said to the US representative, "Where do you get so many opinions? If you continue like this, don't come here!" In the twenty-fourth explanation tent, the chairman of the subsidiary body indignantly said to a US "representative" who was openly nodding to the prisoners of war: "Put your head down, look at the floor, and don't move!"

The Li Syngman secret agents who acted as translators also spoke sternly and deliberately distorted the original meaning when translating, in order to threaten the prisoners of war. In the third tent, the chairman of the subsidiary body said to a quiet prisoner of war: "Your attitude is very honest, I thank you very much!" But the Li Syngman puppet army translator translated it into this: "You don't want to return to North Korea, I thank you very much!" In the eighth tent, a captured person made a fuss for a while, then gradually calmed down and listened to the explanation, his eyes often looking at the door for applying for repatriation. At this time, the Li Syngman puppet army translator suddenly pointed to the door for those who had not applied for repatriation and threatened him, "You can go out in a while." The prisoner of war was stunned for a moment, then shouted in horror: "Five minutes have passed, I can go!" and hurried to go out from the door for those who had not applied for repatriation.

When the explanation work was going on, the Swiss commissioners of the subsidiary body also violated the "terms of reference" and "rules of procedure for explanation and visits" to obstruct the explanation work. In the twenty-ninth explanation tent, a secret agent plugged his ears and dared not listen to the explanation. The chairman of the subsidiary body told him to put down his hands that were blocking his ears. Unexpectedly, the Swiss commissioner slapped the table three times and said loudly: "According to the rules of procedure for explanation and visits, prisoners of war can not listen to the explanation!" The chairman told him: "In fact, the rules of procedure for explanation and visits stipulate that every prisoner of war must listen to the explanation." The Swiss commissioner also stated that if this was the case, he would withdraw from the tent. The chairman said, "You are wrong. I hope you will not delay the explanation work." In the fifth explanation tent, a prisoner of war was nervous and sweating on his forehead because he could not dispel his doubts for a while. The Swiss commissioner present suggested, "This prisoner of war has a stomachache and should be asked to go out and rest." The chairman of the subsidiary body believed that the Swiss commissioner's proposal was unfounded and announced the continuation of the explanation work.

On the day of the explanation work on the 31st, the secret agents mixed among the prisoners of war, according to the instructions of the US and Li Syngman, attempted to attack the explanation representatives by violent means. The chairman of the subsidiary body declared them "defendants," and at least twenty-three people were arrested on the spot by the Indian troops. When one of the secret agents was brought to the door of tent number 6, he saw a South Korean US "observer representative" at a glance, quickly raised his hand in salute, and asked him for instructions, "Minister Xian! What should I do?" The US "observer representative" called "Minister Xian" was exposed on the spot, and he was unable to cover up for a while, frowning and said embarrassedly: "Wait a minute! Wait a minute!"

    十月三十一日对朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释时
    美李特务使用各种无耻手段阻挠战俘遣返
    伪装成“战俘”的特务头子公然坐着吉普车指挥特务捣乱
    【新华社开城二日电】在十月三十一日第一次对朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的过程中，美李特务不择手段地竭力阻挠解释工作、威胁战俘、阻止他们遣返。
    这一天，混在战俘中的李匪特务从一个解释帐篷到另一个解释帐篷去，假装听解释，进行扰乱，拖延时间，以剥夺原应听解释的战俘的权利。这样的情况在第六、十一、十二、十三、十七等号解释帐篷都有发现。当天下午，六号帐篷的一次解释工作结束后，朝中解释代表出帐篷休息，竟看到在第十二号帐篷里一个在狂喊乱叫的“战俘”，原来就是在第六号帐篷里听过解释的第十三个“战俘”。在第十一号帐篷里，有一个“战俘”在破口谩骂解释代表的时候，竟不小心地说出：“你不用讲了，我今天已在别的帐篷里听过了！”
    经过解释后归来的二十一名被俘人员说，他们从出营场直到解释帐篷听解释，始终受着特务的严重威胁。那天出来听解释时，三十五号营场的特务大队长卓武烈自己领头走在前面，他进入解释帐篷中大吵大闹了一阵以后就出来，坐着一辆印度部队的吉普车来回巡视。归来人员张日晞在容纳二百五十个人的等待帐篷、二十五个人的等待帐篷及解释围场附近等处先后碰到他五次，卓武烈每次都是凶狠地吓唬战俘，告诉他们没有一个人申请遣返，解释代表挨了打云云。另外一些已经听过解释的特务分子便在围场里向相距很近的尚未听解释的人狂喊，叫他们如何突袭解释代表。归来人员文长洙说：“在这种气氛下，谁不害怕呀。大家看到大队长在解释场所还这样威风凛凛的，就像我这样下了决心回共和国的人，进解释帐篷以后也有好久不敢表示申请遣返。”
    解释帐篷里面的情况也充分表现出特务对战俘进行长期欺骗恫吓所造成的严重影响。许多人进入帐篷后就喃喃地说“让你讲五分钟”、“让你讲五分钟”，这很明显是特务告诉他们每个人只能听五分钟解释。进入第六号帐篷的战俘都像梦呓似地喊道：“我已知道从后门（即申请遣返的门）出去，就会被杀死！”“再过三个月，联合国军就要把关在愿意遣返收容所里的人统统杀死！”许多战俘们显然是因为相信了特务对他们说的这些话，而不敢申请遣返。
    在解释帐篷里，原由蒋匪特务充当的美方“观察代表”或“翻译”都换成了李承晚特务。他们和美方代表一起在解释进行中公然以极端卑鄙无耻的手段来对战俘进行胁迫。战俘一进解释帐篷，美方这些所谓“代表”和“翻译”就死死地盯住战俘的脸，用眼色和手势警告战俘必须从“尚未申请遣返”的门出去，当战俘不吵不闹并安静地听解释时，他们就故意大声咳嗽来威吓战俘。在第五号解释帐篷中，当解释代表向一个战俘讲话时，这个战俘开始吵吵闹闹，接着用两只手遮住耳朵装作不听，以后他的两只手慢慢地移到耳朵底下，暗暗地听着解释代表的讲话。这时，美方“观察代表”发觉了，就故意不断地大声咳嗽，马上又把这个战俘吓得大叫大嚷起来。这个美方“代表”几乎在每一次解释后，都提出一大堆毫无理由的“意见”和“抗议”，说朝中解释代表提到了“已经申请遣返战俘的姓名”、“朝中方面可以向战俘进行九十天解释”、“朝鲜人民胜利了”等等都是违反协议的。虽然他的无理取闹都遭到附属机构主席的反对，但他在上午仍连续闹了六次。美方这种毫不掩饰地拖延时间的捣乱行为，弄得附属机构主席很不耐烦。主席对美方代表说：“你哪里来这么多意见？再这样，你就不要到这里来！”在第二十四号解释帐篷中，附属机构主席愤慨地对一个公然向战俘点头示意的美方“代表”说：“你把头低下来，把眼睛看着地板，不要动！”
    充当翻译的李承晚特务，也在翻译时厉声厉色和故意歪曲原意，以威胁战俘。在第三号帐篷里，附属机构主席对一个安静的战俘说：“你的态度很老实，我很感谢你！”可是李伪军翻译却翻成这样的话：“你不愿回北朝鲜去，我很感谢你！”在第八号帐篷里，有一个被俘人员吵闹一阵后，便渐渐安静下来听解释，两眼还时常顾盼申请遣返的门。这时，李伪军翻译就忽然手指着未申请遣返的门，威胁地对他说：“你稍等一会就可以出去了。”这个战俘怔了一下，接着又十分惊恐地喊起来：“五分钟已过去了，我可以走了！”便急着要从未申请遣返的门出去。
    在解释工作进行时，附属机构的瑞士委员也违反“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，阻挠解释工作的进行。在第二十九号解释帐篷里一个特务分子把两耳堵起，不敢听解释，附属机构主席告诉他应该把堵住耳朵的两只手放下来。不料这时瑞士委员却拍了三次桌子，大声说：“根据解释和访问工作细则，战俘是可以不听解释的啊！”主席告诉他：“事实上，解释和访问工作细则正是规定了每一个战俘都必须听取解释。”这个瑞士委员还声言如果这样他就要退出帐篷，主席说：“你错了。现在希望你不要再耽搁解释工作的进行。”在第五号解释帐篷里，有一个战俘由于一时未能解除疑惧，精神紧张而额上出汗，在场的瑞士委员提议说：“这个战俘肚子疼，应该叫他出去休息休息。”附属机构主席认为瑞士委员的提议没有根据，宣布继续进行解释工作。
    在三十一日进行解释工作的这一天，混在战俘中的特务按照美方和李承晚的指示，企图以暴力手段攻击解释代表。附属机构主席宣布他们为“被告”，当场由印度部队逮捕了至少二十三人。其中有一个特务分子被带到第六号帐篷的门旁时，他一眼看到一个南朝鲜籍的美方“观察代表”，连忙举手敬礼，并向他请示道：“咸部长！怎么办？”这个被称为“咸部长”的美方“观察代表”被当场戳穿真面目后，一时遮掩不及，皱着眉头，十分尴尬地说：“等一等！等一等！”
