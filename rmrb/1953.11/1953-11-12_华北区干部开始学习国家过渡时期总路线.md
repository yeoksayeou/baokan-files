    North China Region Cadres Begin Studying the General Line for the National Transition Period
    The economic construction theory study of in-service cadres in the North China Region over the past four months has achieved considerable results. A total of 213,000 cadres in the region participated in the study, including 2,500 in the advanced group, 51,000 in the intermediate group, and 159,000 in the elementary group. Before the study, all localities first studied the "Directive of the CPC Central Committee on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954" and the People's Daily editorial "Studying the Theory and Experience of Socialist Construction in the Soviet Union is an Important Task for All Party Cadres."

    After the study began, generally about a month was spent initially reading Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and other relevant documents to grasp the general meaning of the documents before moving on to intensive reading. During intensive reading, due to a lack of experience, many places initially focused on research around problems, but because most comrades had a poor theoretical foundation and were not familiar with Soviet history, they generally felt unable to delve deeply. In addition, some comrades initially collected a lot of reference materials to read, without focusing on studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" itself and the designated documents. The directly affiliated organs of the North China Region first criticized this deviation, requiring everyone to take the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as the center, combined with the designated works of Lenin and Stalin, to deeply study each section and paragraph, first grasping the main content of each section, and then raising questions for research.

    During the study, cadres in economic enterprise departments particularly demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm, completely changing the past situation of lagging behind in learning. This was partly because the content of the study met their needs, and partly because the North China Bureau and the provincial and municipal Party committees had systematically trained some leading comrades in economic enterprise departments; they generally attached importance to the theoretical study of cadres in their departments, personally participated in the study leadership, and served as lecturers. This year, localities encountered few difficulties in hiring teachers, and none of the teachers who were hired declined, and generally, the teachers were active and responsible, and were welcomed by the students. In particular, the comrade teachers working in economic departments were even more popular because of the rich content of their lectures.

    Through this period of study, the average comrade has gained a relatively deep understanding of the principles of the transition from capitalism to socialism, as well as the significance of the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy, the role of commerce, and the importance of the party's centralized and unified leadership in economic construction, thereby further appreciating that "the road taken by the Soviet Union is basically the road we are going to take."

    Now cadres in various localities, according to the instructions of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, are successively turning to the study of the general line and general tasks of the national transition period. The study time is stipulated to be one and a half months.

    华北区干部开始学习国家过渡时期总路线
    华北区在职干部四个月来的经济建设理论学习，已取得不少成绩。全区参加学习的干部共二十一万三千人，计高级组两千五百人，中级组五万一千人，初级组十五万九千余人。学习前，各地首先学习了“中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”和人民日报社论“学习苏联社会主义建设的理论和经验是全党干部的重要任务”。
    学习开始后，一般都用一个月左右的时间初读“联共（布）党史”第九章与其他有关文件，领会文件的大意，然后转入精读。在精读中，由于缺乏经验，很多地方一开始即以问题为中心进行研究，但因多数同志理论基础较差，对苏联历史不熟悉，普遍感到钻不进去。另外，也有些同志一开始就搜罗很多参考资料来阅读，不去着重研读“联共（布）党史”本文和指定的文件。华北一级直属机关首先批判了这一偏向，要求大家以“联共（布）党史”为中心，结合指定的列宁、斯大林有关著作，逐节逐段深入钻研，先领会各节的主要内容，然后提出问题进行研究。
    在学习中，经济企业部门的干部特别表现了高度的积极性，完全改变了过去学习落后的状况，这一方面是由于学习内容切合他们的需要，一方面也由于华北局和各省委、市委都有计划地训练了一部分经济企业部门的负责同志；他们普遍重视了本部门干部的理论学习，亲自参加学习领导，并担任讲课。今年各地在聘请教员时，很少遇到困难，所有被聘请的教员没有发生推辞的现象，而且，教员一般都积极负责，受到学员的欢迎。特别是在经济部门工作的教员同志，由于讲课内容丰富，更受到大家的欢迎。
    经过这一时期的学习，一般同志对于从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的原理，以及苏联新经济政策的意义、商业的作用和党领导的集中统一在经济建设中的重要性，普遍有了较为深刻的理解，从而对“苏联走过的道路在基本上正是我们所要走的”，有了进一步的体会。
    现各地干部，根据中共中央华北局的指示陆续转入国家过渡时期总路线总任务的学习。学习时间规定为一个半月。
