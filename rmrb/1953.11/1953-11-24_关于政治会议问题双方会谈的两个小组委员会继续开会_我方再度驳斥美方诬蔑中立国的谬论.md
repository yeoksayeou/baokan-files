Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 23rd - The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue issued the following communiqué:

On November 23rd, the two subcommittees of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue held their sixth meeting.

In the subcommittee discussing the first agenda item, the US side's representative still did not offer any constructive opinions on the issue of members, continuing to repeat the clichés of slandering neutral nations, saying that their participation in the political conference would turn it into an "endless debate," in order to oppose the participation of neutral nations in the political conference.

Mr. Qi Shifu, the representative of our side, again refuted this fallacy of the US side. He said: "In fact, the participation of neutral nations makes it more difficult for your side to use delaying and sabotaging tactics, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of the political conference. If your side does not intend to reuse the tactics you habitually used in the armistice negotiations in the political conference, then your side has no need to fear the participation of neutral nations in the political conference." He further pointed out: The other side has already agreed to include the issue of the members of the political conference on the agenda and has agreed to resolve it through an exchange of views. However, since the two sides entered into substantive discussions on the issue of members, the other side has attempted to deny the existence of the issue of members, its purpose clearly being to obstruct and delay the convening of the political conference, so as to be free to arbitrarily violate the armistice agreement, maintain world tension, and carry out war intimidation and deception.

In the subcommittee discussing the second agenda item, our side continued to raise specific criticisms of the unreasonable aspects of the other side's suggestions, and the other side expressed its willingness to consider our side's criticisms.

    关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会继续开会
    我方再度驳斥美方诬蔑中立国的谬论
    【新华社开城二十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十三日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第六次会议。
    在讨论第一项议程的小组委员会中，美方代表对成员问题仍未提出任何建设性的意见，继续重复其污蔑中立国将使政治会议成为“无休止的辩论会”的陈词滥调，以反对中立国参加政治会议。
    我方代表奇石福先生对于美方此种谬论再度加以驳斥。他说：“事实上，中立国的参加正是使得你方不易于使用拖延和破坏会议的手段，从而保证政治会议的顺利进行。你方如果无意把你方在停战谈判中惯用的手段重新在政治会议中搬用，你方就无需害怕中立国参加政治会议。”他又指出：对方已经同意将政治会议的成员问题列入议程，并同意通过交换意见加以解决。但自从双方对成员问题进入实质的讨论以来，对方却又企图否定成员问题的存在，其目的显然是在于阻挠和延迟政治会议的召开，以便不受约束地任意破坏停战协定，保持世界紧张局势，进行战争吓诈及撞骗。
    在讨论第二项议程的小组委员会中，我方继续对于对方建议的不合理的地方提出具体的批评，对方表示愿意对我方批评加以考虑。
