We, the entire body of representatives, on behalf of industrialists and businessmen throughout the country, express our most heartfelt gratitude and pay our most sublime respects to you and the Central People's Government!

    Over the past four years, we, private industrialists and businessmen, thanks to your leadership and education and that of the People's Government, have achieved preliminary transformation and some progress, and have considerably weakened our backwardness and negativity, which has enabled us to contribute our due share to the economic recovery and construction of our great motherland. This glory is bestowed upon us by you and the People's Government, and we will work even harder to leverage the positive role of private industry and commerce to repay you and the People's Government for your kindness!

    You have instructed us on the general line and general task for the transition period, which is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. Our entire body of representatives has engaged in enthusiastic discussion and careful study, and deeply understands that this is the only path for our country to embark on the bright and happy socialist society. We unanimously support your great instructions and firmly believe that, under your leadership and education and that of the People's Government, we will certainly be able to complete the transformation of enterprises and the transformation of individuals.

    We, the entire body of representatives, hereby assure you that each of us, upon returning to our respective regions and posts, will certainly convey your instructions and those of the Central People's Government, continue to strengthen the education of patriotism and law-abidingness, study diligently, transform diligently, unite industrialists and businessmen throughout the country, and strive together to implement the general line and general task of the transition period! We respectfully wish you good health and boundless longevity!
