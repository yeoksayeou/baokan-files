Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 22nd: The people of Pakistan have expressed great concern and indignation over news revealed in newspapers regarding a proposed Pakistani-American military agreement.

The Executive Committee of the Karachi Peace Committee held a meeting on the 16th and passed a resolution stating: "We are deeply concerned by news reports that Pakistan is being persuaded to establish some kind of defense alliance with the United States and Turkey."

The resolution stated: "It is appalling that the United States, after the failure of the doomed Middle East Defense Organization, is once again conspiring to drag Pakistan into its world war strategy. The consequence of signing any such military agreement would be to hand over all our resources to foreign disposal, bring war to our doorstep, and allow foreign powers to dominate our national life."

The resolution also stated that such action "would seriously undermine our unity with Islamic countries."

The meeting also demanded that the official spokesperson of Pakistan resolutely and clearly state that the Pakistani government will never sign any military agreement with the United States.

A two-day meeting of the Council of the People's Muslim League in Mymensingh, East Pakistan, closed on the 15th. The meeting expressed strong opposition to Pakistan signing any military alliance with any country and demanded that Pakistan stand on the side of the peace camp.

At a meeting held on the 17th, the Karachi Democratic Students Union passed a resolution expressing unease over news in the newspapers about "Pakistan joining the US military alliance." The resolution stated: "The signing of this military treaty would soon lead to the loss of our sovereignty and independence. The people and youth of Pakistan have suffered unforgettable sacrifices in the struggle for sovereignty and independence."

    巴基斯坦人民反对与美国签订军事协定
    【新华社新德里二十二日电】巴基斯坦人民对报纸所透露的关于拟议中的巴美军事协定的消息，表示了极大的忧虑和愤慨。
    喀喇蚩和平委员会执行委员会在十六日举行会议，通过决议说：“据报纸所登载的消息，巴基斯坦正被劝说与美国和土耳其建立某种防御同盟，这个消息使我们感到深为忧虑”。
    决议说：“在注定了要失败的中东防御组织宣告失败之后，美国又重新阴谋活动想把巴基斯坦拖进它的世界战争策略里去，这种阴谋活动是十分惊人的。签订任何这样的军事协定的结果都会是把我们全部资源交给外国处置，把战争带到我们门口，以及允许外国支配我们的国民生活”。
    决议又说，这种行动“一定会严重地破坏我们和回教国家之间的团结”。
    会议并要求巴基斯坦官方发言人毅然而明确地表示巴基斯坦政府决不与美国签订任何军事协定。
    在东巴基斯坦密门辛举行的历时两天的人民回教联盟理事会会议于十五日闭幕。会议表示强烈地反对巴基斯坦和任何国家签订任何军事联盟，并要求巴基斯坦站在和平阵营方面。
    喀喇蚩民主学生联合会在十七日举行的会议上通过一项决议，决议对报纸上关于“巴基斯坦加入美国的军事联盟”的消息表示不安。决议说：“这个军事条约的签订，使我们的主权和独立会很快地丧失。巴基斯坦的人民和青年曾为争取主权和独立而遭受过不能忘怀的牺牲。”
