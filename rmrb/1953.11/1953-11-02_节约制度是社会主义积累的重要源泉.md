    The consistent implementation of the economy system, that is, the implementation of measures aimed at reducing labor expenditure and making good use of all means of production and funds, is of great significance in the continuous development of various social productions in the Soviet Union.
    The economy system is one of the socialist methods of management. The working people of the Soviet Union have a vested interest in its strengthening and deepening. The purpose of socialist production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. The means to achieve this goal is the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on a high technical basis. Therefore, the economy system not only promotes the development of socialist production, but also aims to improve the living standards of the Soviet people.
    The most important manifestation of the economy system is the enormous saving of human labor and the increase in labor productivity.
    In the Soviet Union, nothing can hinder technological progress. Production technology is constantly developing, and production organization is also improving. This creates conditions for the continuous growth of labor productivity.
    In 1952, the labor productivity of industrial workers increased by almost 61 percent compared with the eve of World War II, and labor productivity has increased approximately 7.5 times since the establishment of the Soviet regime. Three-quarters of the increase in total industrial output during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) will be achieved through increased labor productivity, and one-quarter will be achieved through increases in the number of workers.
    In other sectors of the national economy, such as agriculture and transportation, labor productivity is also increasing.
    The increase in labor productivity is reducing the need for increased labor, which is of great national economic significance.
    In the Soviet Union, the utilization of socialist production tools (machine tools, machines, machinery, and various equipment) is constantly developing, which is equivalent to the construction of thousands of new enterprises. In 1951 alone, the Soviet state obtained an additional 1.3 million tons of pig iron by improving the utilization of blast furnace potential.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan has stipulated further and better use of production potential. The plan stipulates that the increase in the output of pig iron and cement by about 30 percent and the increase in coal production by a quarter will be achieved by making good use of existing production potential.
    In other sectors of the Soviet national economy, the level of utilization of production tools is also growing.
    If in 1932, the thermal power plants of the Electrical Industry Department of the Soviet Union consumed an average of 770 grams of fuel per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, then in 1952, the consumption of standard fuel had been reduced to 526 grams. This made it possible to save millions of tons of fuel.
    This is the national economic significance of implementing the economy system.
    From the first day of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have organized a nationwide struggle for economy. This was an arduous task. It was necessary to overcome the legacy of capitalism and educate millions of people in the spirit of a communist attitude towards labor and socialist public property.
    In the harsh years of the domestic war and foreign armed intervention, the economy system promoted the saving and rational consumption of extremely limited material resources in the country, thereby promoting economic victory.
    In the years of restoring the destroyed national economy, the Communist Party mobilized the Soviet working people to consistently implement the economy system. Labor discipline was strengthened, labor productivity was increased, and product costs were reduced. This made it possible to systematically increase appropriations for basic construction funds. After successfully restoring the pre-war production level, the Soviet Union turned to implementing the policy of socialist industrialization, that is, turning a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Large-scale heavy industrial enterprise construction began, which required huge amounts of funds, but the funds had to be found within the country.
    In early 1926, the Central Committee of the Communist Party passed a resolution on the issue of the economy system. The Party wrote a special letter to all Party organizations and all Party members. The Party instructed: "Waste and unthrifty use of state funds, cooperative funds, and other social organizations' funds must be regarded as a crime against the working class."
    The broad masses of the people responded to the Party's call. The struggle for economy was widely launched and achieved more and more achievements. The economy system has become an important source of appropriations for national industrialization.
    In the years of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people to defend their independence, the economy system made it possible to save a large amount of important materials and reduce the cost of military supplies. The total amount of funds saved has exceeded 50 billion rubles.
    In the post-war years, the economy system has promoted the restoration and development of the national economy. Under the leadership of the Party organization, a huge movement of economy has been launched across the country, and many new forms of competition have emerged, such as competition to reduce product costs, competition to make good use of production potential and working capital, and competition for comprehensive economy.
    Although the Soviet people have achieved great results in the struggle for economy, the potential for economy has not yet been fully utilized. These potentials are constantly expanding along with the development of production technology and technical procedures and the improvement of production organization.
    What is the potential for economy?
    The most important potential for economy lies in the ability to further increase labor productivity on a high technical basis, to reduce labor expenditure in the production of product units, to enrich working days and reduce working hours.
    In enterprises that produce the same kind of products but expend different working hours, raising backward enterprises to the advanced level can greatly increase labor productivity.
    Every enterprise has the potential to increase labor productivity, because in addition to advanced workers, there are also ordinary workers, and there are also workers who cannot complete the quota.
    The greatest potential for economy lies in the ability to make good use of raw materials and fuel, because these materials are still being consumed in large quantities without production results.
    For example, in advanced power stations, the fuel consumption for producing each kilowatt-hour of electricity is already 15 to 20 percent lower than the average quota.
    Often, a large amount of materials are stockpiled.
    It is possible to continue to improve the utilization of production tools—machine tools, machines, equipment—such as increasing the workload of machines, reducing their downtime, and putting idle equipment into use. Putting them into use is equivalent to building new enterprises and increasing production equipment.
    Further potential for economy is like this.
    So, what are the methods of economy?
    The methods of economy are varied. They vary according to the national economic sector, the form of production, and the specific conditions of certain enterprises.
    The main methods of economy can be summarized as follows:
    Improve the proficiency of cadres—improve their cultural and technical level.
    Improve production technology and technical procedures, and improve the organization of production and labor.
    Further development of socialist competition and enriching its new forms is the basis for utilizing all potentials and a method of socialist economy.
    The most important method of economy is to improve the proficiency of cadres, because people are the main productive force of society. The higher the level of workers' proficiency, the higher their ability. The first thing that comes with improving proficiency is the increase in labor productivity. Skilled workers know the condition of the machines they work with very well, and they are good at squeezing the maximum capacity out of them, and they are good at making better use of raw materials and fuel.
    Usually, improving workers' cultural and technical level is accompanied by improving all production and economic indicators.
    The Kubawinsk fine woolen factory planned to improve the proficiency of all employees of the factory during the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Employees who had not received complete secondary education studied in secondary schools without leaving production, and employees who had received secondary education studied in technical colleges or universities. The factory has dozens of various study groups and training classes in total. In the factory's summary, its production plan for the Fourth Five-Year Plan has been completed ahead of schedule. Labor productivity has been increased, production capacity has been increased, and a large amount of raw materials has been saved, so that the factory has produced hundreds of thousands of meters of fabric beyond the plan.
    The development of production technology and technical procedures is the basis for improving and developing all production.
    The important form of developing technology—the mechanization and automation of production—is of great significance. This form can save a lot of labor, increase its production capacity, and reduce people's labor.
    For example, the application of the "Donbass" coal mining combine and cyclical work system in the mines of the Kukov Coal Industry Trust has doubled labor productivity. The application of the "Ukht-1" type coal mining combine in the "October Revolution" mine has increased labor productivity by 72 percent.
    The automation of boiler equipment reduces the need for labor by 10 to 15 percent, while also saving fuel and improving the technology of using boilers.
    Even a thermal power station with a generating capacity of 500,000 kilowatts that is not fully automated can save about 20,000 tons of fuel and free up 3,500 train cars needed to transport fuel in a year. The total amount saved annually from reducing unnecessary personnel is about 6 million rubles.
    Improving the technical procedures in production is of great significance. The improvement of technical procedures can accelerate the production process, reduce interruptions in the production process, and promote the increase of labor productivity and the good use of means of production.
    For example, casting liquid metal in metal models—cold models and centrifugal castings—reduces the amount of material removed, reduces the time for mechanical processing of castings, and increases labor productivity and the degree of use of equipment.
    Rational technical procedures such as splitting metal, leather, etc., and transitioning from forging to stamping sheets and changing the structure of parts are of great significance.
    For example, when manufacturing generators, the "Electricity" factory in Leningrad changed its structure, which saved dozens of tons of metal for each generator, because its weight was reduced by 125 tons.
    In any form of production, if the development of production technology and technical procedures occurs, it usually leads to extreme savings.
    Improving the organization of production and labor is also of great significance. It can enable the correct division of labor in labor and its cooperative, reasonable arrangement of labor force, improve the specialization of production sections, and maintain cleanliness and order in production.
    Switching to the assembly line method can reduce expenditure, supplement operating time and service time, accelerate the production process, increase output, and reduce the need for production area. All of these can lead to extreme savings.
    In the Soviet Union, the measures of the economy system are not implemented spontaneously, but are stipulated in the state plan. The necessity of economy has been taken into account when stipulating product quotas and the quotas for using machine tools, machines, equipment, raw materials, and fuel, when formulating plans for reducing product costs and plans for cooperation and transportation.
    But no matter how meticulously the plans and quotas are formulated, they can never estimate all the possibilities of economy that are only shown in the process of implementing the plan and in the process of socialist competition.
    Therefore, in the struggle for economy, it is of great significance to encourage the development of socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement and to promote new forms of competition.
    The economy system has always been one of the important economic and political tasks of the Soviet people.
    Socialist economy is increasing the wealth of the Soviet Union, expanding the domestic materials, strengthening the economic power of the Soviet state, and accelerating the pace of the Soviet people towards communism.

    节约制度是社会主义积累的重要源泉
    苏联经济学硕士  叶·卡西莫夫斯基
    一贯地实行节约制度，也就是实行旨在减少劳动的耗费、很好地使用一切生产资料和资金的办法，在苏联各种社会生产的不断发展中有着重大的意义。
    节约制度是社会主义的经营管理方法之一。苏联的劳动人民对它的加强和深入有切身利害关系。社会主义生产的目的是最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法就是达到这个目的的手段。所以，节约制度不单是促进社会主义生产的发展，而且是为了提高苏联人民的生活水平。
    节约制度的最重要表现是人的劳动的巨大节省和劳动生产率的提高。
    在苏联没有什么可以阻碍技术进步的。生产技术不断地发展，生产组织也在改善。这给劳动生产率的不断增长创造着条件。
    一九五二年，工业工人的劳动生产率几乎比第二次世界大战前夜增加百分之六十一，自从苏维埃政权成立以来，劳动生产率约增加到七点五倍。工业品总产量在第五个五年计划期间（一九五一年—一九五五年）所增加数目的四分之三将由提高劳动生产率的方法来获得，四分之一将由工人数目的增加而获得。
    在国民经济的其他部门，如农业和运输等部门中，劳动生产率也在增加着。
    劳动生产率的增加在减少着对增加劳动力的需要，这是具有巨大的国民经济的意义。
    在苏联，社会主义生产工具（机床、机器、机械和各种装备）的利用程度在不断地发展着，这是和建设数千个新的企业有同等价值的。只在一九五一年，由于改善利用鎔铁炉的潜力，苏维埃国家曾额外地得到了生铁一百三十万吨。
    第五个五年计划已规定进一步更好地利用生产潜力。在五年计划中所规定的把生铁和水泥的产量增加约百分之三十和把采煤量增加四分之一，这将靠着良好利用现有的生产潜力来获得。
    在苏联其他国民经济部门中，利用生产工具的水平也在增长着。
    如果说，在一九三二年苏联电站电气工业部的热力发电站在生产每瓩时电力平均耗费燃料七百七十公分，那末，在一九五二年标准燃料的耗费就已减到五百二十六公分。这就可能节省燃料数百万吨。
    这就是实行节约制度的国民经济意义。
    自从苏维埃政权建立的头一天起，共产党和苏联政府就已经组织了为节约的全民性的斗争。这曾是一个艰钜的任务。必须克服资本主义的遗产，用共产主义的态度对待劳动和社会主义公有财产的精神，来教育千百万的人民。
    在国内战争和外国武装干涉者的严酷年月里，节约制度曾促进了对国内极其有限的物资资源的节省和合理的消费，从而促使了在经济上的胜利。
    在恢复被破坏的国民经济的年月里，共产党曾动员了苏联劳动人民始终一贯地来执行节约制度。劳动纪律加强了，劳动生产率提高了，产品成本也降低了。这就可能有系统地对基本建设基金增加拨款。顺利地恢复了战前的生产水平以后，苏联就转到实行社会主义工业化政策上面来，也就是使落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。大规模的重工业企业建设开始了，这曾需要了巨大的资金，可是必须在本国内部找得资金。
    一九二六年初，共产党中央委员会通过了关于节约制度问题的决议。党特别给全体党组织和全体党员写了一封信。党指示说：“必须把浪费和不节省使用国家资金、合作社资金、及其他社会组织的资金看作是对工人阶级的罪行”。
    广大的人民群众响应了党的号召。这个节约斗争广泛地展开了，并获得了越来越多的成就。节约制度已成为对国家工业化拨款的重要泉源。
    在苏联人民为保卫自己独立的伟大卫国战争年代中，节约制度曾使有可能节省大量的重要物资和降低军需品的成本。节约下来的资金总额已超过五百亿卢布。
    在战后年代中，节约制度曾促进了国民经济的恢复与发展。在党组织的领导下，在全国展开了节约的巨大运动，产生了许多新的竞赛形式，如降低产品成本的竞赛，很好使用生产潜力和流动资金的竞赛，全面节约的竞赛等。
    虽然，苏联人民在节约的斗争中已取得了巨大成果，可是节约的潜力还远没有完全利用。与发展生产技术和技术手续以及改进生产组织的同时，这些潜力在不断地扩大着。
    节约的潜力是怎么回事呢？
    节约最重要的潜力在于能在高度技术基础上进一步提高劳动生产率，能够在产品单位生产上减少劳动的耗费，充实工作日和缩减工时的耗费。
    在生产同一种类的产品而耗费着不同工时的各企业中，把落后的企业提高到先进的水平可使劳动生产率大大提高。
    每个企业都有提高劳动生产率的潜力，因为除了先进工人以外，还有普通的工人，并且还有不能完成定额的工人。
    节约最大的潜力在于能够很好地利用原材料、燃料，因为这些物资依然是没有生产效果地大量地耗费着。
    例如：在各先进的电力站中，生产每一瓩时电力的燃料耗费已低于平均定额的百分之十五到二十。
    时常，使大量的物资积压起来。
    继续改善利用生产工具——机床、机器、装备——的程度是可能的，如提高机器的工作量，缩减它的停歇现象和使闲放着的装备动用起来。把它们动用起来，这是和建设新的企业及增加生产装备有同等价值的。
    进一步节约潜力就是这样。
    那么，节约的方法是怎样呢？
    节约的方法是各式各样的。它们是以国民经济部门为转移，以生产形式和某些企业的具体情况为转移。
    主要的节约方法，我们可以举出下列的几点：
    提高干部的熟练程度—提高他们的文化和技术水平。
    改进生产技术和技术手续，改善生产与劳动的组织。
    进一步开展社会主义竞赛和充实它的新形式是利用一切潜力的基础和社会主义节约的方法。
    节约的最重要方法是提高干部的熟练程度，因为人们是社会主要的生产力量。工人熟练程度的水平越高，他们的能力也越高。提高熟练程度首先随之而来的是劳动生产率的增加。熟练的工人很好地知道他们工作着的机器情况，他善于从这里挤出最大限度的能力，并善于更好地使用原材料和燃料。
    通常，提高工人的文化技术水平是伴随着改进一切生产经济指标的。
    库巴温斯克细呢绒工厂在第四个五年计划期间曾有计划地提高工厂全体员工的熟练程度。没有受过完全中等教育程度的员工们，不脱离生产地在中等学校学习，至于受过中等教育的员工们则在技专或高等学校学习。该工厂总计有几十个各种学习小组和实习班。在工厂的总结中，它的第四个五年计划的生产计划已提前完成。劳动生产率提高了，生产能力也增加了，节省了大量原料，从而使该工厂超计划地生产了数十万公尺织物。
    生产的技术和技术手续的发展是改进和发展一切生产的基础。
    发展技术的重要形式——生产的机械化和自动化具有着巨大的意义，这种形式可以节省大量的劳动，提高它的生产能力和减轻人们的劳动。
    例如：古柯夫煤业托辣斯的矿井应用了“顿巴斯”采煤联合机和循环工作制后因而把劳动生产率提高了一倍。“十月革命”矿井应用了“乌克特—一”式采煤联合机后，使劳动生产率增加了百分之七十二。
    锅炉装置的自动化使劳动力的需要减少百分之十到十五，同时并得到燃料的节省和使用锅炉的技术的改进。
    甚至是发电量为五十万瓩的不完全自动化的热力发电站，在一年内也可能节省约两万吨燃料和腾出为输送燃料所必需的车皮三千五百辆。每年从缩减不必要的人员而节省下来的全部金额约达六百万卢布。
    改进生产上的技术手续具有着很大的意义。技术手续的改善可以加速生产过程，缩减在生产过程当中的间断，并可以促使劳动生产率的提高和很好地利用生产资料。
    例如：把液体金属倾铸在金属模型内—冷模和离心式铸物这就缩减了放头，减少对铸物机械加工的时间和提高劳动生产率及使用装备的程度。
    分裂金属、皮革等物以及由锻冶过渡到冲压片和改变零件构造等的合理技术手续是具有着巨大的意义。
    例如：列宁格勒的“电力”工厂在制造发电机的时候，改变了它的构造，这就使每个发电机节省了几十吨金属，因为它的重量减低一百二十五吨。
    在任何的生产形式中如果出现了生产技术和技术手续的发展，通常，总会导致极大的节省。
      改进组织生产和劳动也有着重大的意义。它可使劳动及其合作社达到正确分工，合理布置劳动力，提高生产工段的专业化，保持生产上的清洁和秩序等。
    转用流水作业法可减少耗费，补充作业时间和服务的时间，加速生产过程，增加产量，缩减对生产面积的需要。所有这些都可以导致极大的节省。
    在苏联，节约制度的措施并不是自流地实行，而是在国家计划上规定好了的。在规定产品定额和使用机床、机器、装备、原料、燃料的定额时，在制订减低产品成本的计划和合作化及输送等的计划时就已考虑到节约的必要性。
    可是无论怎样精密地把计划和定额制订出来，它们永远也不能估计到只是在执行计划进程中和在社会主义竞赛进程中所显示出的节约的一切可能性。
    因此，在节约的斗争中，鼓励开展社会主义竞赛和斯大哈诺夫运动以及推广新的竞赛形式是具有巨大的意义的。
    节约制度始终是苏联人民经济与政治的重要任务之一。
    社会主义节约在增加着苏联的财富，扩大着国内的物质，加强着苏维埃国家的经济威力和加速着苏联人民向共产主义前进的步伐。
