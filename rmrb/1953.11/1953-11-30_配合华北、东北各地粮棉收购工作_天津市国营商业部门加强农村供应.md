To cooperate with grain and cotton procurement in North and Northeast China, Tianjin state-owned commercial departments are strengthening the supply of industrial products to rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, in October alone, procurement and supply stations for cotton cloth, general merchandise, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and the petroleum wholesale station and salt company, supplied goods equivalent to more than 4,000 train carloads. This means that an average of more than three trains fully loaded with supplies were transported to small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas in North and Northeast China every day. These included various fabrics,绒衣, towels, socks, daily necessities, dyes, kerosene, medicines, and salt needed in rural areas during the autumn and winter. To meet the increasing demand for industrial products in various regions, most stations have expanded their supply figures for the fourth quarter. The Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company recently held a supply meeting, allocating over 100 billion yuan worth of various general merchandise suitable for rural needs to the general merchandise companies in small and medium-sized cities. These goods were supplied in addition to the original supply plan. Among them, popular items such as rubber shoes and thermos bottles will be prioritized for supply to grain-procuring regions in Shanxi, Henan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaodong. To ensure timely supply, some units have even advanced the execution of supply contracts. The Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the Chemical Raw Materials Company had already shipped out the dyes that were supposed to be supplied in November in October.

This year, the prices of many industrial products supplied to rural areas are cheaper than last year; if calculated in terms of grain, they are even cheaper. For example, according to the cotton cloth supplied by the Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company in October, consumers (mainly farmers) can save about 8 billion yuan due to the price being cheaper than last year.

This year, many state-owned commercial units have also guided industry to improve quality and specifications, making products more suitable for the rural market and more pleasing to farmers. The Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the General Merchandise Company has added large plain white towels weighing 28 to 30 liang (per dozen), which are most suitable for farmers to wrap their heads with; the supplied socks include twisted coarse-yarn socks with reverse velvet inside, which are quite warm to wear. The Monopoly Corporation and various cigarette factories have studied and increased the production of Class C and D cigarettes, which cost about 1,000 yuan per pack and are suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas. The Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the Pharmaceutical Company has supplied a large number of commonly used medicines for the treatment of seasonal epidemics in autumn and winter to Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Rehe, Inner Mongolia, and other regions. According to the needs and habits of farmers, most of the supplies are convenient to carry and inexpensive tablets. The Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the Chemical Raw Materials Company has changed the packaging of dyes from 30 to 60 kg per barrel to 6 kg and 10 kg packaging to meet the needs of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.

Employees of various units have also come up with many ways to overcome difficulties in transportation and allocation. Employees of the Tianjin Salt Company have strengthened contact with the coastal offices, made preparations in advance, seized the opportunity to utilize various means of transportation, and ensured that goods were waiting for vehicles, solving the problem of transportation delays. They overfulfilled the transportation plan for October, supporting the vast rural areas of North and Central South China with tens of thousands of tons of salt. Employees of the Tianjin Procurement and Supply Station of the Pharmaceutical Company put forward the goals of fast receiving, fast testing and inspection, fast invoicing, fast packing, and fast shipping in the competition, and business personnel were assigned to the warehouse to help with the work, shortening the handling procedures and the time of entering and leaving the warehouse, and requesting vehicles in advance, shortening the transit time of goods.

The current problems are that the transportation and allocation work of some units has not yet fully caught up; the supply procedures and warehousing procedures are still relatively slow; the spirit of vigorously supporting rural areas in commodity distribution has not been fully implemented; in terms of sales, the power of various economic components has not been well organized and utilized; and the supply plan for November of several units was less than half completed in the first half of the month. For this reason, all units must conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Ministry of Commerce, continue to strengthen leadership over supply and transportation and allocation work, and check and promptly overcome shortcomings in the work.

### 配合华北、东北各地粮棉收购工作  天津市国营商业部门加强农村供应

    配合华北、东北各地粮棉收购工作
    天津市国营商业部门加强农村供应
    天津市国营商业部门正加强对农村供应工业品，支援华北、东北各地粮棉收购工作。据不完全的统计，仅花纱布、百货、化工、医药等采购供应站和石油批发站、盐业公司等七个单位，十月份全月供应各地的物资即折合四千个车皮以上。也就是说平均每天有三列多火车满载物资运到华北和东北等地的中小城市和广大农村中去。其中包括农村秋冬需要的各种布匹、绒衣、毛巾、袜子和各种日用百货、染料、煤油、药品和食盐等。为了适应各地对工业品需要增加的情况，各站大都扩大了第四季度的供应数字。中国百货公司天津采购供应站最近举行了供应会议，将库存适合农村需要的商品，尽量供应各中小城市的百货公司机构，会上分配的各种百货总值一千多亿元。供应的这些货品都是在原来的供应计划以外的。其中胶鞋、热水瓶等畅销货将尽先供应山西、河南、吉林、黑龙江、辽东等收购粮食地区。为使供应及时，有些单位还提前执行了供应合同。化工原料公司天津采购供应站早在十月份即把应在十一月份供应的染料提前调出。
    今年许多供应农村的工业品价格比去年便宜了，如果折合粮食计算，就便宜得更多。譬如按十月份花纱布公司天津采购供应站调出的布匹计算，由于今年价格比去年便宜，即可使消费者（主要是广大农民）节省八十亿元左右。
    今年许多国营商业单位还指导工业改进质量规格，使产品更适合农村市场，更称农民的心。百货公司天津采购供应站今年增添了二十八两到三十两重（每打）的大条素白毛巾，最适合农民包头用；供应的袜子有合股的粗线袜子，里面还挂倒绒，穿起来挺暖和。专卖事业公司和各烟厂研究，增加了丙、丁级纸烟的生产，这两种烟每包一千元左右，适合广大农村的需要。医药公司天津采购供应站向河北、山西、绥远、热河、内蒙等地区供应了大量治疗秋冬季节性流行病的常用药品，并根据农民的需要和习惯，供应的多是便于携带和价廉易服的片剂。化工原料公司天津采购供应站把每桶三十至六十公斤包装的染料，改为六公斤、十公斤包装，以适应中小城市和农村的需要。
    各单位职工还想了许多办法，克服运输调拨中的困难。天津市盐业公司职工加强了与海滩办事处的联系，提前作好准备工作，抓紧利用各种交通工具，作到以货等车，解决了运输延误问题，超额完成了十月份的运输计划，以数万吨的食盐支援了华北、中南广大农村。医药公司天津采购供应站职工在竞赛中提出了接收快、化验检验快、开票快、配装快、运发快的目标，并由业务员下库帮助工作，缩短了办理手续和出入库时间，并提前要车，缩短了商品在途时间。
    目前的问题是有些单位的运输调拨工作仍未完全赶上去；供应手续和出入库手续仍比较缓慢；在商品分配上，大力支持农村的精神贯彻得还不够；推销上，还没有很好地组织与使用各种经济成分的力量；有几个单位十一月份供应计划在上半月完成还不到一半。为此，各单位必须认真贯彻中央商业部的指示，继续加强对供应和运输调拨工作的领导，检查和及时克服工作中的缺点。
