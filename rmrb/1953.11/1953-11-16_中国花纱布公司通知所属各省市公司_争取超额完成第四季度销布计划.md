The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company recently issued a notice requiring its affiliated provincial and municipal companies to expand the sales of general merchandise, strengthen inter-provincial and inter-municipal adjustments, pay attention to the control of locally processed cloth, and strive to overfulfill the fourth quarter cloth sales plan.

The national state-owned cotton yarn and cloth system basically completed the cotton cloth sales task in the third quarter of this year, but the completion of the plan varied greatly from region to region. For example, Shanxi Province only completed 46.19 percent of its sales plan in September. To this end, the notice specifically proposed:

First, efforts should be made to expand the sales of general varieties of cotton cloth based on the existing inventory. At present, many regions still have a large number of commodities that have been backlogged in warehouses for a long time and cannot be displayed to customers. Some companies blindly pursue brand-name goods and do not pay attention to the sales of general varieties, which affects the market supply. Changing these situations is of great significance to the increase in production and economy and the expansion of sales in the state-owned commercial system. Facts have proved that as long as attention is paid to promotion, general varieties can open up sales channels. For example, after the Henan Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company put the Czech blue cloth, Hunan blue cloth, and Red Plum White Cloth that had been backlogged in the warehouse into the stores, they became popular goods loved by the masses after promotion. The vulcanized blue cloth and blue twill in the warehouse of the Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing and Supply Station were previously considered difficult to sell in many places. Recently, thanks to the efforts of various places to promote them, they have found sales outlets. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan and other provinces have also requested to increase allocations. Therefore, in order to better complete the cotton cloth sales task in the fourth quarter, it is necessary to overcome the brand-name goods mentality and ensure that all inventory varieties are displayed to customers based on the existing inventory varieties.

Second, appropriate adjustments of varieties should be carried out between provinces and municipalities and among neighboring companies. Because some commodity allocations have not fully met the needs of the sales areas, local companies have more or less unsalable varieties, resulting in backlogs in area A and out-of-stock situations in area B, which affects the accelerated circulation of commodities and the completion of the cloth sales plan. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to carry out reasonable adjustments of unsalable commodities within the region with provinces and municipalities and neighboring companies. For example, the Xinye Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company in Henan and the Fancheng Branch Company and Shuanggou Sales Office in Hubei Province, after consultation, signed a cotton cloth exchange contract, exchanging 1,540 pieces twice. After exchanging the unsalable commodities in the region, both parties became popular products, increased supply, and expanded sales. This is worth promoting in various places. Therefore, the notice requires that provincial and municipal companies should strengthen contacts. In addition to participating in variety exchange meetings and exhibitions, they should use commodity quotations, sending samples, and soliciting adjustments (transfer in and transfer out) communication methods as much as possible to contact companies in neighboring regions at any time to exchange what they have for what they lack. In the adjustment work, attention should be paid to the rational flow direction of commodities to avoid roundabout transportation.

Finally, all localities should pay attention to the control and supply of locally processed cloth to meet the needs of the masses. Some locally processed cloths (including hand-woven cloth) have a certain sales volume in many areas because they are suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas, and the quality of locally processed cloth can be further guided or improved through production and sales integration. Therefore, the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth system must pay attention to mastering it.

### 中国花纱布公司通知所属各省市公司  争取超额完成第四季度销布计划

　　中国花纱布公司通知所属各省市公司
    争取超额完成第四季度销布计划
    中国花纱布公司最近发出通知，要求所属各盛市公司，扩大一般商品的推销，加强省内外调剂，注意地方加工布的掌握，争取超额完成第四季度销布计划。
    全国国营花纱布系统今年第三季度基本上完成了棉布推销任务，但各地区完成计划情况极不平衡。如山西省九月份只完成推销计划的百分之四十六点一九。为此，通知具体提出：
    首先应在现有库存品种的基础上，扩大一般品种的推销。目前仍有不少地区很多商品在仓库内长期积压，不能和顾客见面。有的公司却盲目追求名牌货，不注意一般品种的推销，因而影响了市场的供应。这些情况的改变，对国营商业系统的增产节约扩大推销有着十分重要的意义。事实证明一般品种只要注意推销，就能打开销路。如河南省花纱布公司把积压在库内的捷克蓝布、湖南青布、红梅白布等拿到门市部后，经过宣传推销，便成为群众所热爱的畅销货。上海花纱布采购供应站仓库中的硫化蓝布、蓝斜纹，过去很多地方认为不好销，近经各地努力推销，已有销路；广东、广西、福建、云南等省还要求增加调拨。因此，为了很好的完成第四季度的棉布销售任务，必须克服名牌货观点，在现有库存品种基础上，做到库存品种全部和顾客见面。
    其次，要适当地展开省内外及友邻公司的品种调剂，由于有些商品调拨未能尽适合销地需要，各地公司都有或多或少的不适销的品种，形成甲地积压、乙地脱销，既影响商品加速流转，也影响销布计划的完成。因之，展开地区内不适销商品与省内外及友邻公司的合理调剂，是极为必要的。如河南新野花纱布支公司和湖北省樊城支公司和双沟营业所，经过洽商，订立了棉布交换合同，两次即交换了一千五百四十匹，双方把地区内不适销的商品交换后，都成为畅销品，增加了供应力量，扩大了销售，这是值得各地推广的。因之，通知中要求各省市公司应加强联系，除互相参加品种交流会、展览会外，尽可能采用商品报价、寄样、征求调剂（调入调出）的通讯方式，与友邻地区的公司随时进行联系，互通有无。在调剂工作中应注意商品合理的流转方向，避免迂回运输。
    最后，各地应注意地方加工布的掌握和供应，以满足群众的需要。地方加工布（包括手工织布）有些由于适合广大农村需要，在不少地区有一定销路，并可通过产销结合，进一步来指导或改进地方加工布的质量，因此，国营花纱布系统必须注意掌握。
