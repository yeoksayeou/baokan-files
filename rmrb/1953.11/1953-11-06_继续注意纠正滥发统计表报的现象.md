    Continue to Pay Attention to Correcting the Phenomenon of Indiscriminate Issuance of Statistical Reports
    Editor's Note: The indiscriminate issuance of statistical reports is a concrete manifestation of subjectivism and decentralism. After overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon, the hectic situation in district and township work has been greatly alleviated in various regions; however, the undesirable phenomenon of indiscriminate issuance of reports still exists in a few areas. It is evident that to thoroughly correct this phenomenon, it is necessary to establish a scientific working system, constantly combat subjectivism and decentralism, and continuously inspect and correct to achieve results. The facts revealed in the reader's letters published below deserve the attention of relevant departments.

    Busy Day and Night with Numbers
    Li Jian from the Hebei Provincial People's Government Statistics Bureau writes: Although the Cangxian District Committee and Jingxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hebei Province have undergone work to correct the "five excesses," they still indiscriminately issue investigation and statistical outlines and forms, creating chaos in rural statistical work. According to inspection, from September 8th to the end of September, the Cangxian District Committee Office issued a total of four investigation and statistical outlines to Jingxian County regarding disaster relief drainage, wheat planting, sideline production, etc. The Jingxian County Committee issued six investigation and statistical outlines to the districts. These outlines have complex items, making investigation very troublesome. For example, the wheat planting outline requires statistics on how many mu of land were flooded by river water, how many mu were flooded by waterlogging, how many mu were drained, how many mu were planted with plow and seed drill, how many mu were cultivated with plow and seed drill, how many mu were planted with large seed drill, etc. The District Committee Office issued an outline on investigating and statistically analyzing disaster conditions, harvest conditions, and relief, etc. Based on this outline, the County Committee created a large form three feet long and two and a half feet wide, with 182 investigation items alone, which could not be unfolded on the table. Because the District Committee and County Committee mostly issued investigation outlines, the districts and townships had to create forms and add items at each level. For example, Jingxian County's First District, based on the spirit of the disaster investigation report outline issued by the County Committee Office, added items such as the living conditions of disaster victims, the living conditions of revolutionary martyrs' families and demobilized soldiers, and also created four types of survey forms with 99 additional items. Townships created even more forms. From the beginning of September to the beginning of October, the Yangzhuang Township government in the First District created 17 types of survey forms, totaling 412 items. The deadlines for filling out these complex outlines were very short, so the numbers were often not accurate. What is particularly unreasonable is that the Jingxian County Cooperative and the County Work Group in Wuzhuang Village of the First District also arbitrarily created forms, requiring village cadres to fill them out.

    This phenomenon of illegal forms flooding the countryside has affected production and disaster relief work, and cadres and the masses are extremely dissatisfied. Wang Zuyao, a township cadre in Yangzhuang Township, First District, said: "Since September, I have filled out more than 20 kinds of household registration forms. I am busy with numbers day and night, which makes my brain ache. I don't have time to lead disaster victims in production!"

    Obtained Some "Bureaucratic Figures"
    Xinghuo from the Twelfth District People's Government of Lixian County, Hunan Province, writes: The leading organs of Lixian County indiscriminately issue forms during the busy season of autumn harvest and autumn planting and set deadlines for filling them out. From August 14th to August 24th, in eleven days, county-level organs issued seven types of forms to the townships through the Twelfth District People's Government. These forms were complicated and troublesome, making statistics difficult. Some forms were delivered in the morning and had to be filled out in the afternoon. In order to complete the task of filling out the forms, district and township cadres had to put aside the work of leading production and look for materials everywhere, even "estimating and estimating" to "get some bureaucratic figures" (meaning inaccurate figures) to send in. The purpose of issuing statistical forms was originally to enable higher levels to grasp the situation below. The result of the Lixian County leading organs' indiscriminate issuance of forms is that they have obtained some "bureaucratic figures." What use is this for the work?

    The Top Asks for Randomness, the Bottom Creates Randomly
    Fu Shiyang and Dong Kongfu from the Yu Huan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhejiang Province, write: On August 24th, the Chengguan District Committee of the Yuhuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to grasp the situation after the typhoon disaster, printed an outline filling two large sheets of paper and issued it to various towns for investigation and statistics, setting a deadline of 7:00 a.m. the next morning to report to the district. This outline had seven major points and twenty-five items. A comrade in charge of investigating Ximen Village in Huanshan Town called the militiamen that night and started the investigation. One item in the outline was "How many households will be short of food in half a month?" A militiaman said: "How can we know so accurately without going to every household to see?" But because it was too troublesome to go to each household, everyone calculated by counting their fingers and filled it in. Fang Shengzhong, the chairman of the Heping Township Farmers' Association in the former urban area, reported a moderate middle number based on past "experience" when investigating households short of food. As a result, the district party secretary praised him greatly, saying that the numbers he reported were "reasonable and sensible." There are many situations like this where the top asks for randomness and the bottom creates randomly. For example, the total cotton field area in Yuhuan County is only 1,754 mu, but in the statistics of crop losses after the typhoon disaster, the damaged cotton field area in the county became more than 2,188 mu. Isn't this a strange tale?

    Five Complicated and Difficult-to-Fill Forms
    Li Kangyou from the Qidong County People's Government of Jiangsu Province writes: Wang Xingyi, the secretary of the Haifu District Committee in our county, drafted five types of forms on October 6th and sent them to eleven electoral districts in Zhenbei Township (a pilot township for the general election) for filling out, in order to collect information on the combination of the general election and production achievements, etc., and arranged for cadres to help collect materials and be responsible for supervision.

    These five types of forms have a total of 105 items, which are not only complicated and difficult to fill out, but also contain some numbers that are impossible to statistically analyze. For example, the item "Accumulating Green Manure and Grass" requires statistics on the number of catties of grass accumulated and the number of mu of fields that can be fertilized; however, the habit here is to count grass accumulation by piles, and no one uses scales to weigh it. For example, the "Seed Selection Situation" item requires the number of catties of corn and cotton seeds selected; however, farmers who selected corn seeds had already stored them two months ago, and cotton is in its peak flowering period, with most of the selected cotton still remaining on the cotton branches. Can we go to each household to weigh the catties of corn seeds selected and go to the fields to count the catties of cotton seeds selected branch by branch? For example, in the "Depth" item of the general election propaganda situation table, it is necessary to statistically analyze the number of voters who "can understand and speak," "can understand but cannot speak," and "do not understand"; to statistically analyze these numbers, it is impossible to understand without gathering all voters for testing. The "Breadth" column of the general election propaganda situation table requires statistics on the number of voters who have received one, two, or three educations; to fill it out carefully, one has to ask the voters one by one how many meetings have been held. If we want to find correct and complete numbers for these 105 items, I really don't know how much manpower it will take to complete.

    At present, the autumn harvest and autumn planting are in full swing, and the Central Committee has long pointed out that agricultural production is the central task in rural areas, and all practices that hinder agricultural production must be stopped. When drafting these five types of forms, did the secretary of the Haifu District Committee consider what the current central task is? What effect will these five types of forms have when sent down?

### 继续注意纠正滥发统计表报的现象

专栏：读者来信摘要

    继续注意纠正滥发统计表报的现象
    编者按：滥发统计表报是一种主观主义、分散主义的具体表现。各地经过克服“五多”现象以后，区乡工作中的忙乱现象已大为减轻；但在少数地区滥发表报的恶劣现象仍然存在。可见要彻底纠正这种现象，必须建立科学的工作制度，不断地和主观主义、分散主义作斗争，并且要不断地检查纠正才能奏效。下面发表的读者来信所揭露的事实，值得有关部门注意。
    白天黑夜为数目字忙
    河北省人民政府统计局李建来信：中共河北省沧县地委会和景县县委会虽然经过了纠正“五多”的工作，但仍滥发调查统计提纲和表格，造成农村统计工作的混乱现象。据检查，沧县地委办公室自九月八日至九月底，向景县颁发了关于救灾排水、种麦、副业生产等调查统计提纲共四次，景县县委发往区的调查统计提纲六次。这些提纲项目繁复，调查起来非常麻烦。如种麦提纲内要统计河水淹地多少亩，沥水淹地多少亩，脱出多少亩，犁耧耩麦多少亩，耕犁耩麦多少亩，大耧耩麦多少亩等。地委办公室发了一个有关调查统计灾情、年景、救济等项目的提纲，县委根据这个提纲制了一个三尺长、二尺五寸宽的大表格，光调查项目就有一百八十二个，放在桌子上还摊不开。由于地委、县委发的大部是调查提纲，区乡就得制造表格，并层层附加，增添项目。如景县一区根据县委办公室发的灾情调查汇报提纲精神，又附加了灾民生活情况、烈军属和在乡军人生活情况等项目，另外还增制了九十九个项目的四种调查表。乡级增制的表格就更多，一区杨庄乡政府自九月初到十月初，共增制了调查表格十七种，共有四百一十二个项目。这些繁复的提纲要求填报的期限又都很短，因而数字往往不真实。尤其不合理的是，景县合作社和一区吴庄村的县工作组也擅自制发表格，要村干部填报。
    这种非法表格泛滥农村的现象，影响了生产和救灾工作，干部和群众都极感不满。一区杨庄乡乡干部王祖尧说：“自九月份以来，我已填写逐户登记的表报二十多种，白天黑夜为数目字忙，闹得脑子发痛，那有工夫去领导灾民生产呢？”
    弄到了一些“官僚数字”
    湖南省澧县第十二区人民政府星火来信：澧县领导机关在秋收秋种的农忙季节中滥发表格，并且限期填报。从八月十四日到二十四日十一天中，县级机关经由第十二区人民政府发到乡的表格有七种。这些表格都复杂麻烦，统计困难。有的表格上午送到，下午就要填报。区乡干部为了完成填表任务。只得放下领导生产的工作到处去找材料。甚至“估计估计”，“搞个官僚数字”（意即不确实的数字）送去。发统计表格的目的原是为了使上级掌握下面的情况。澧县领导机关滥发表格的结果，弄到了一些“官僚数字”，这对工作又有什么用呢？
    上面乱要下面乱造
    中共浙江省玉环县委员会傅世扬、董孔甫来信：八月二十四日，中共玉环县城区委员会为了掌握台灾后的情况，印了写满两大张纸的提纲，发给各镇进行调查统计，限定于第二天晨七时报区。这个提纲共有七大点二十五项。负责调查环山镇西门村的一个同志，当夜叫了民兵，就调查开了。提纲中有一项是“半个月后缺粮的有多少户？”一个民兵说：“不到家家去看，那里能知道得这样准确。”但由于挨户去看很麻烦，大家就屈指头算一下填上去。前城区合坪乡农会主任方圣中在调查缺粮户时，根据过去“经验”报了一个不多不少的中间数字。结果区委书记竟对他大加表扬，说他报的数字“入情入理”。像这样上面乱要、下面乱造的情况是很多的，例如玉环县全县棉田面积总共只一千七百五十四亩，在台灾后农作物损失情况统计中，全县棉田受损面积却变成二千一百八十八亩多。岂不是笑话奇谈？
    五种复杂难填的表格
    江苏省启东县人民政府李康佑来信：我县海复区区委书记王兴义为了搜集普选结合生产成绩等情况，在十月六日拟了五种表格发给镇北乡（普选试办乡）十一个选区填报，并布置了干部帮助搜集材料及负责督促。
    这五种表格共一百零五项，不仅复杂难填，而且有些数字根本无法统计。例如“积绿肥蕴草”一项，要统计蕴草斤数和能垩田亩数；但是这儿习惯蕴草都用堆计，没有谁用秤秤。又如“选种情况”一项中要玉米和棉花选种斤数；可是选种玉米的农民们早在两个月前就已储藏起来了，棉花则正在盛开时期，大部分选种棉花还留在棉枝上，难道可以挨家挨户去秤选种玉米的斤数和到田间逐枝去统计棉花选种的斤数吗？又如普选宣传情况表的“深度”一项内，要统计“能懂且能讲”、“能懂不能讲”、“不懂的”选民各多少；要统计这几个数目字，不把所有选民集中起来进行测验，是无法了解的。普选宣传情况表“广度”一格内要统计选民受到一次、二次、三次教育的各多少；若要仔细填报，就得向选民逐个询问开过几次会。倘若要为这一百零五项都找出正确、完整的数字，那真不晓得要用多少的人力才能完成。
    目前秋收秋种正在紧张地进行，中央早已指出农业生产是农村中的中心任务，一切妨碍农业生产的做法必须停止进行。海复区区委书记在拟制这五种表格时，曾否考虑到当前的中心任务是什么？这五种表格发下去会起什么作用？
