    Jiangxi Yongxiu County Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team's Waiting for "Grain Price Increase" Affected Production
    Actively Sells Grain to Expand Production After Reversing the Reluctance to Sell Mentality
    The members of the Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth District of Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, were reluctant to sell grain some time ago because they were waiting for "grain price increases," which affected production. Later, after realizing that they had suffered from the reluctance to sell, they actively sold grain to expand production.
    This year, with the strong support of the government, the Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team, although it encountered some disasters such as animal diseases and droughts, still had a very good rice harvest. The team's 310 mu of land yielded 15 percent more than last year.
    At the end of the summer harvest, the members of the Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team did not yet realize that selling grain to the state was conducive to developing production and further improving their lives, and conducive to the country's industrial construction. They were still looking at new things with "old eyes." They saw that the government had set up grain purchasing stations in many places, and the price of new grain on the market was higher than the price in the first half of the year. Although local work cadres publicized the state's policy of purchasing grain, they were still not very reassured, thinking that "grain prices will rise in the future" and "by the end of the year, one dan of grain will sell for the price of two dan of grain." Coupled with the rumors of some speculative private merchants and bad elements, their thinking became even more confused. They locked the new grain at home and waited every day for "grain prices to rise."
    For more than two months since the start of the grain purchasing work, many farmers have enthusiastically sold their grain to the state and, at the same time, promptly purchased the necessities for production and life, and happily worked hard to engage in production. At this time, only the members of the Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team were still waiting for "grain prices to rise," guarding their grain without selling it. Many households in the team lacked seeds and fertilizers, and some needed to add and repair agricultural implements, but because the grain had not been sold, these things could not be done.
    As the autumn harvest was approaching and winter planting was about to begin, those farmers who had sold their grain to the state and promptly bought back seeds, fertilizers, and other production necessities had taken a step forward in production, while only the Dai Zhengbao Mutual Aid Team had fallen behind. At the same time, grain prices not only did not rise, but also fell a little. Seeing this situation, some team members felt very annoyed.
    The mutual aid team held a team member meeting to study how to deal with the new grain and arrange winter production. When everyone explained the situation, they were all shocked: in addition to the lack of seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural implements, most of the red clover seeds, rapeseed, and bean seeds for the 340 mu of land that were about to be planted were not yet available. At this time, the team leader Dai Zhengbao and some team members realized that they had suffered a great loss from the reluctance to sell mentality of waiting for "grain prices to rise." If this problem is not resolved quickly, not only will the winter planting plan not be completed, but next year's increase in production will also be in vain. However, some team members still did not understand and wanted to wait a little longer.
    Dai Zhengbao reflected this situation to the local government. With the help of government work cadres, Youth League members and ideologically progressive team members first studied the state's policy of purchasing grain and exposed the rumors of speculative private merchants and bad elements. At this time, everyone's thinking gradually changed. Then, another team member symposium was organized to mobilize everyone to talk about "what are the benefits of selling grain to the state." Everyone compared the benefits of the People's Government's grain purchasing policy with the situation of "spring rises and summer falls" and "low grain prices hurt farmers" during the rule of the reactionaries in the past, and their speeches were very enthusiastic. Team member Dai Shengji recalled that during the autumn harvest one year before liberation, the landlord forced him to pay debts, and the private merchants took the opportunity to lower grain prices. He had to reluctantly sell grain at a price of one silver dollar per dan to repay the debt; the following spring, the whole family ran out of food, and the landlord and private merchants raised the grain price to four silver dollars per dan. He said: "Now the People's Government has increased grain prices at once when new grain comes on the market, and grain purchasing stations have been set up at our doorsteps. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives have also purchased many items to supply to farmers. Of course, we should sell grain to the state." He immediately expressed that he must sell grain to the grain purchasing station to support industrial construction and expand production. Team member Dai Zhenghui also expressed that he would dry the four hundred jin of grain again and send it to the grain purchasing station to sell.
    In three days, the whole team sold more than 4,300 jin of grain to the grain purchasing station and was praised by the grain purchasing station. They then bought back 485 jin of winter seeds from the cooperative; they added what agricultural implements needed to be added, and repaired what needed to be repaired. The women also selected and purchased cloth and daily necessities at the cooperative. Now the team members are all beaming with joy and actively engaged in production.

    江西永修县戴征宝互助组等待“粮食涨价”影响了生产
    扭转惜售思想后积极出卖粮食扩大生产
    江西省永修县四区戴征宝互助组的组员们，前些日子因为等待“粮食涨价”，不肯卖粮，影响了生产，后来发现吃了惜售思想的亏，便积极出卖粮食，扩大生产。
    戴征宝互助组今年在政府大力扶助下，虽然遇到了一些兽、旱等灾害，稻谷收成还是很好。全组三百一十亩田，比去年增产了百分之十五。
    夏收结束时，戴征宝互助组的组员们还没有认识到将粮食卖给国家，有利于发展生产和进一步改善生活，有利于国家工业建设，还是用“老眼光”来看新事情。他们看见政府在许多地方设立了购粮站，新谷登场的价钱比上半年的价钱还高。虽经当地工作干部宣传国家收购粮食的政策，但是他们总是不很放心，以为“将来谷价还会涨”，“到年底一担谷要卖两担谷的价”。加上一些投机私商和坏分子的造谣，他们的思想就更糊涂了。他们把新谷关在家里，天天等望着“粮价上涨”。
    购粮工作开始了两个多月，许多农民都踊跃地把粮食卖给了国家，同时及时添置了生产和生活上的需用品，高高兴兴地努力搞生产。这时，只有戴征宝互助组的组员还在等候“粮价上涨”，守着谷子不卖。组员中有许多户缺种籽，缺肥料，有的需要添制和修整农具，但是因为谷子没有卖，这些事情都办不了。
    在秋收已经迫近，冬种也快开始的时候，那些把粮食卖给国家及时买回种籽、肥料和其他生产必需品的农民在生产上都走前了一步，只有戴征宝互助组落后了。同时粮价不但没有上涨，反而还跌了一点。看到这种情形，部分组员才感到很懊恼。
    互助组召开了组员大会，研究怎样处理新粮和安排冬季生产。大家一摆情况，才都大吃一惊：除种籽、肥料和农具缺少外，连马上就要下种的三百四十亩田的红花草籽、油菜籽、豆种都大部没有着落。这时，组长戴征宝和部分组员才认识到这是吃了等“粮食涨价”的惜售思想的大亏。这个问题如不赶快解决，不但冬种计划完不成，明年的增产也要落空。可是还有一部分组员没有想通，还想等一等。
    戴征宝把这情况反映给当地政府。在政府工作干部的帮助下，青年团员和思想进步的组员首先学习了国家收购粮食的政策，揭破了投机私商和坏分子的谣言。这时大家思想上才逐渐转变过来。接着又组织了一次组员座谈会，发动大家来漫谈“卖粮给国家有些什么好处”。大家把人民政府收购粮食政策的好处和过去反动派统治时候“春涨夏跌”、“谷贱伤农”的情况对比起来谈，发言非常踊跃。组员戴圣吉想起解放前有一年秋收的时候，地主逼着讨债，私商又趁机压低谷价，他只好忍痛以一块银元一担的价钱卖谷子还了债；第二年春天，一家大小断了粮，地主和私商就把谷子涨到四块银元一担。他说：“现在人民政府在新谷登场时就一次把粮价提高了，购粮站又设在家门口，国营贸易商店和合作社又采办了许多物品来供应农民，咱们当然应该把粮食卖给国家。”他当场表示一定要把粮食卖给购粮站，支援工业建设，扩大生产。组员戴征惠也表示要把四百斤谷再晒一遍，送到购粮站去卖。
    三天内，全组卖给购粮站四千三百多斤谷，受到购粮站的表扬。他们随即又在合作社买回了冬种种籽四百八十五斤；农具该添的添了，该修的就修理。妇女们还在合作社选购了布匹和日用品。现在组员们都喜气洋洋地积极搞生产。
