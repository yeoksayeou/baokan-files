    I Love the Work the Party Assigned Me
    Shen Yunfen
    My name is Shen Yunfen, I am eighteen years old this year, and I am a typist in a certain unit of the North China Military Region. Leaders and comrades say that I have created a new typing record in the North China Military Region, that I am a worker in the style of Guo Waliaof, and that I understand the principle of serving the people. I really feel uneasy because this "new record" was not created by me alone. Without the cultivation of the Party, the help of the comrades around me, and the "new typing operation method" created by Comrade Wang Jialong of a certain agency as a foundation, I would not be able to create anything.
    In November 1951, when I finished my studies at a certain military cadre school, the organization decided that I would do typing work. I had never done typing work before, and I was a little hesitant at the time. But I thought that I joined the army in response to the call of the motherland, and today the motherland needs me to do typing work, so of course I shouldn't bargain; I also thought that when I was in school, I was the secretary of the League branch, and the League organization repeatedly educated League members to obey the organization's decisions; I even remembered my father's education to me: in the cause of the Party, one should not emphasize personal interests, and it is shameful to be picky! In this way, with the determination to do a good job, and with the mentality of learning at the job, I came to the typewriter.
    At that time, I was so excited because I was going to work, really start doing revolutionary work. When I entered the door of the typing group, I heard the sound of "clack-clack" all over the room. This sound attracted me; when I saw the typewriter, I loved it even more. When I was in military cadre school, I heard stories of how the Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army soldiers loved their weapons. Now that I am standing at the typing job, the typewriter is my weapon to serve the people.
    The beginning of a job is often difficult. When I started learning to type, the comrades taught me from the basic movements. They taught me how to sit, how to hold the type basket handle with my left hand, how to change lines and pages, and so on. Although I studied hard, I was too unfamiliar, and I couldn't take care of both looking and typing, and I couldn't take care of both the top and the bottom. My hands, eyes, and brain were not enough. The machines of other comrades were always "clack-clacking," but my machine was out of breath. I was a little anxious, and I thought about this thing while eating and sleeping. Comrade Wang Yansheng, who taught me to type, gave me some advice when he saw this situation, and helped me specifically; I also practiced more diligently. A month passed, and when I tested my speed, I could type a thousand words per hour, but the actual work efficiency did not reach this number.
    The "Three-Anti" movement was a good exercise opportunity for me. During the movement, typing work was particularly heavy. If my technology was still a thousand words per hour, I obviously could not complete the task assigned to me by the Party. I realized that I must quickly master the technology and improve the technology in order to take on the work. So, I worked day and night, even staying up at night, in order to improve myself in my work. After the "Three-Anti" movement, I checked my gains and found two: first, the "Three-Anti" movement improved my class consciousness; second, the busy and tense work gave me practical exercise. At that time, I could type two thousand two hundred words per hour.
    Although I had such achievements, and although my work efficiency had doubled in a short period of time, I was not satisfied, especially when I heard that Comrade Wang Jialong of a certain agency had created a "new typing operation method" and could type three thousand and twelve words per hour. Some new comrades who had only been working for three months could type two thousand seven hundred words per hour, I felt that I was too backward. I and the comrades proposed to further improve our technology. At this time, the leaders also proposed that we should strengthen our business studies. Our entire typing group immediately made a plan. In order to learn advanced experience, we went to visit the performance of the "new typing operation method." After returning, the entire group divided into mutual aid groups and spent two hours each day learning the new operation method. At first, the comrades and I just blindly practiced speed, and each practiced his own, without giving play to the role of the mutual aid group. As a result, no one improved, and some even reduced their speed. Everyone's thoughts became chaotic. The leadership clarified our chaotic thoughts in a timely manner and invited Comrade Wang Jialong to teach us. After that, when we practiced the new operation method every day, we also observed each other and exchanged experiences in the mutual aid group at night. A week later, I improved to two thousand five hundred words per hour.
    One week of practice has educated me: learning technology and doing work cannot be done alone, we must be good at studying together with comrades, be good at learning from comrades, absorb and concentrate the advantages of comrades, and integrate them to enrich ourselves; especially we must humbly learn from advanced workers. For example, when I first practiced the new techniques in the "new typing operation method," I always failed to master them. I should have used "three fingers to hold the handle and wrist force to press down," but I often became "three fingers holding the handle too tightly" and "elbow force pressing down." In this way, after a long time, my arms became too strained, my fingers became stiff and painful, and my work could not last. I didn't master the action of "lightly pulling and heavily striking, unifying two movements" well at the beginning, and it became "heavily pulling and heavily striking, going up at once," which easily damaged the machine, broke the lead type, and made the characters into black squares. I studied together with the comrades, observed each other, and gradually mastered these actions skillfully after repeated practice. I also often absorbed the advantages of the comrades' operations to enrich myself. For example, when practicing the methods of "looking at the manuscript while typing" and "not taking up typing time to look at the manuscript" in the new operation method, I initially felt very difficult. Comrade Zhang Yaojin in the group mastered it well, so I observed his practice, and gradually I also made improvements.
    "Changing lines," "moving the manuscript holder," "looking at the manuscript," and "finding characters" were originally four movements. Comrade Zheng Huanqin in the group simplified them into two movements, which can shorten one and a half seconds each time. The movement of "two hands approaching each other" was proposed by Comrade Zhang Guiru in the group. In addition, there are also "pulling the machine to find characters," "using the time of pulling up and down the paper to look at the manuscript," and so on. Whenever I discovered various large and small advantages of the comrades in the operation, I absorbed them into my work. This enriched my work experience and improved my technical level. This is also an important reason for the improvement of my typing speed.
    It should be especially mentioned the help of the Party and the leaders. Whenever the leaders knew that I and my comrades had any requirements or encountered any difficulties, they always helped us solve them in a timely manner. I remember once the machine I was using broke down. At that time, I was very sad because other comrades could work, but I couldn't. Group leader Liu Zhongxin knew my mood and immediately tried to help me repair the machine. Another time, my machine was broken for twelve days. During this period, Comrade Liu Zhongxin helped me make full use of this time: observing the actions of other comrades, finding relevant materials introducing advanced typing experience to study, and at the same time I also summarized my own experience and made a plan for future technology learning. In order to pursue speed, I once had the problem of ignoring quality. Once I typed more than two thousand words and made more than ninety mistakes! Comrade Liu Zhongxin talked to me, studied the reasons for the many mistakes with me, and explained the importance of quality. At that time, Comrade Zheng Huanqin in the group proposed to me to achieve three accuracy: see accurately, pull accurately, and type accurately. I also took the initiative to learn from comrades with good quality. With the help of the group leader and comrades, my work quality improved, and the average number of errors was reduced to 0.24% (the error standard at that time was 0.3%). When my work had some progress, Director Yang Zibi praised me at the business summary meeting and pointed out the direction of my efforts. Chief of Staff of the Military Region Yang Chengwu also praised me at the department affairs meeting. The concern and encouragement of the leaders gave me greater strength.
    However, at that time, I had not yet broken the record of three thousand words per hour. Just as I was thinking of continuing to improve my work efficiency, my father came. The first thing he asked was, "How many have you typed?" When I thought that some comrades had already broken three thousand words, I felt ashamed. Kalinin said: "In order to learn to work well, you must be greedy for work, you cannot learn to work without greed." The reason why I have not yet broken three thousand words and have not reached a higher record, strictly speaking, is because I am not yet greedy for work. I am a person who loves activities: I love to dance, I also love to sing, and I often go to the park on holidays. Typing work is irregular, and sometimes Saturdays are busier than weekdays. Because I thought of entertainment, I made more mistakes in the documents I typed on Saturdays or Sundays. Comrade Liu Zhongxin and the League group leader helped me study the reasons, which turned out to be because I had not handled the relationship between cultural and entertainment activities and work well. From then on, I made appropriate arrangements for cultural and entertainment activities and work, and in order to quickly improve my technology and better work for the Party, I sometimes sacrificed my rest time on Saturday nights or Sundays to practice technology. I also seized the few minutes between the end of cultural classes and the start of dinner to practice unfamiliar movements. I used all the time that could be used.
    Under the education and encouragement of the Party, after five months of hard study, when I was tested in early December last year, I was able to type three thousand three hundred and thirty-seven words per hour, breaking the highest typing record in the North China Military Region. However, I have not completely eliminated errors, and there are still two errors in this number, which has not yet reached the requirement of accuracy.
    My work achievements are very small, but the Party has given me great honor. In January this year, at the first Workers and Peasants Representatives Conference of the North China Military Region, I was awarded the titles of "First Class Meritorious Servant" and "Second Class Model." This is the honor given to me by Chairman Mao, the honor given to me by the motherland. I must cherish it and carry it forward. I will never be arrogant and complacent. In the future, I will definitely work more closely with my comrades, continue to work hard under the leadership of the Party, and do my work better.

    我热爱党分配给我的工作
    沈蕴芬
    我叫沈蕴芬，今年十八岁，是华北军区某部的打字员。上级和同志们说我创造了华北军区的打字新纪录，说我是郭瓦廖夫式的工作者，说我懂得了为人民服务的道理。我实在感到不安，因为这“新纪录”并不是我一个人创造的，如果没有党的培养，没有周围同志们的帮助，和某机关王家龙同志创造的“新打字操作法”作基础，我什么也创造不出来。
    一九五一年十一月，我在某军事干部学校学习结束时，组织上决定我作打字工作。我从来没有做过打字工作，当时心里有点犹豫。但我想到自己参军是响应祖国的召唤而来的，今天祖国需要我做打字工作，当然不该讨价还价；又想到在学校时，自己是团分支部书记，团组织曾一再教育团员要服从组织决定；我更想起父亲对我的教育：在党的事业中，不应该强调个人兴趣，挑三挑四是可耻的！这样，我带着做好工作的决心，抱着到工作岗位上去学习的心情，到了打字机跟前。
    当时，我是多么兴奋啊，因为我要工作了，要真的开始做革命工作了。进打字组的门口时，我听到满屋“嘎达——嘎达”的声音。这种响声吸引了我；一见打字机，我更爱上了它。在军事干部学校时，我听到过解放军、志愿军战士们爱护武器的故事，现在我站在打字工作的岗位上，打字机就是我为人民服务的武器。
    一件工作的开始往往是困难的。我开始学打字的时候，同志们从基本动作教我做起。他们教我坐的姿势，教我怎样用左手握住字盘把手，怎样换行、换页，等等。我虽然用心学习，可是因为太生疏，顾了看顾不了打，顾了上顾不了下，手、眼、脑子都不够用。其他同志的机子总是“嘎达——嘎达”地响，我的机子却是上气不接下气。我有点心急，吃饭睡觉都想着这件事。带我学打字的王燕生同志看到这种情形，给我提了些意见，并且具体地帮助我；我也更加用心练习。一个月过去了，测验速度时，我一小时能打一千字了，但按工作的实际效率还达不到这个数字。
    “三反”运动对我是一个很好的锻炼机会。在运动中，打字工作特别繁重，如果我的技术还是一小时一千字，显然不能完成党交给我的任务。我认识到我必须迅速掌握技术，提高技术，才能把工作承担起来。于是，我白天黑夜地干，甚至夜晚不睡觉，以求在工作中能够提高。“三反”运动过后，我检查我的收获有两条：第一，“三反”运动提高了我的阶级觉悟；第二，繁忙紧张的工作，使我得到实际的锻炼，当时我一小时能打两千二百字了。
    虽然有了这样的成绩，虽然我的工作效率在较短期间提高了一倍，但我并不感到满足，特别是当我听到某机关王家龙同志创造了“新打字操作法”，每小时能打三千零十二个字，有些新同志参加工作只三个月，每小时就能打二千七百字的消息时，我感到自己太落伍了。我和同志们提出要进一步提高技术。恰在这时，上级也提出要我们加强业务学习。我们全打字组立即订了计划。为了学习先进经验，我们去参观了“新打字操作法”的表演。回来后，全组又划分互助组，每天抽两小时学习新操作法。起初，我和同志们只是盲目地练快，并且各练各的，没有发挥互助组的作用。结果谁也没有提高，有的速度反而降低了。大家的思想混乱起来。领导上及时澄清了我们的混乱思想，并请王家龙同志来教我们。以后我们每天练习新操作法时，又互相观摩，晚上在互助组上交流经验。一个星期以后，我提高到一小时能打二千五百字了。
    一个星期的实践教育了我：学习技术和进行工作，都不能单干，必须善于和同志们共同研究，善于向同志们学习，吸取和集中同志们的优点，综合起来，丰富自己；特别要向先进工作者虚心学习。譬如我开始练习“新打字操作法”中的新手法时，总是不得法。应该“三指握柄、腕力下压”，而我往往成了“三指握柄过紧”和“肘力下压”。这样时间稍长，胳膊太吃力，手指发僵、发痛，工作不能持久。“轻引重打、两动贯一”动作，开始也掌握得不好，变成“重引重打、一下上去”，这样就容易坏机子、断铅字和把字打成黑方块。我和同志们共同研究，互相观摩，又经过反复练习之后，才逐渐熟练地掌握了这些动作。我也经常吸取同志们操作中的优点来丰富自己。譬如练习新操作法中的“边打边看稿”和“看稿不占打键时间”的方法时，我最初感到很困难，组里张尧瑾同志掌握得好，我便观摩他的作法，渐渐地我也有了改进。
  “换行”、“移压稿器”、“看稿”和“找字”本来是四个动作，组里郑焕勤同志把它们简化成两个动作，一次可以缩短一秒半钟；“两手相凑”的动作，是组里张桂茹同志提出的；另外还有“拉机子找字”、“利用上下纸时间看稿”等等，凡是同志们在操作中的各种大小优点，我发现后都吸收到我的工作中来。这样才丰富了我的工作经验，提高了我的技术水平。这也就是我的打字速度提高的重要原因。
    应当特别提到的是党和上级的帮助。每当领导上知道我和同志们有什么要求或是遇到什么困难时，总是及时地帮助我们解决。记得一次我使用的那个机子坏了，当时我很难过，因为别的同志能工作，我却不能工作。组长刘忠信知道了我的心情后，立刻设法帮助我修好了机子。另一次，我的机子坏了十二天，在这期间刘忠信同志帮助我把这些时间充分地利用起来：观摩其他同志的动作，找有关介绍打字先进经验的材料学习，同时我也总结了自己的经验，并作出以后学习技术的计划。为了追求快，我曾经发生忽略质量的毛病。有一次我打二千多字竟错了九十多个字！刘忠信同志找我谈话，和我研究错字多的原因，并说明质量的重要。当时组里的郑焕勤同志向我提出要做到三准：看准、拉准、打准。我也主动向质量好的同志学习。在组长和同志们的帮助下，我的工作质量提高了，错字平均减少到万分之二点四（当时错字标准是万分之三）。当我的工作有了些许进步时，处长阳自碧同志便在业务总结会上表扬我，并给我指出努力的方向。军区参谋长杨成武同志在部务会议上也表扬我。首长对我的关心和鼓舞，给了我更大的力量。
    然而当时我还没有突破一小时三千字的纪录。我正想继续提高工作效率的时候，父亲来了。他第一句话就问：“打多少了？”我想到有的同志已经突破三千字，内心便惭愧起来。加里宁说过：“为要学会很好地作工，就必须贪恋于工作，没有贪恋心是学不会作工的。”我所以还没有突破三千字，还没有达到更高的纪录，严格地讲，是因为对工作还没有贪恋心的缘故。我是一个爱活动的人：爱跳舞，也爱唱歌，在假日里也常去游园。打字工作时间不规律，有时星期六比平日更忙。因为想到娱乐，星期六或星期天，我打的文件错字特别多。刘忠信同志和团小组长帮助我研究原因，原来就是因为自己没有把文娱活动和工作的关系处理好。从那以后，我把文娱活动和工作作了适当的安排，而且为了迅速提高技术，更好地为党工作，有时我牺牲星期六夜晚或星期日的休息时间练习技术。每天下文化课后到开饭中间的几分钟，我也要抓紧时间练习不熟悉的动作。我利用了一切可能利用的时间。
    在党的教育和鼓舞下，经过五个月的钻研苦练，去年十二月初测验时，我一小时能打三千三百三十七个字，突破了华北军区打字最高纪录。但是，我还没有完全消灭差错，在这个数字里还有两个错字，还没有达到准确无误的要求。
    我的工作成绩很小，党却给了我很大的荣誉。今年一月，在华北军区首届工学代表会议上，我荣获“一等功臣”、“二级模范”的称号。这是毛主席给我的荣誉，祖国给我的荣誉，我一定珍贵它，发扬它。我绝不骄傲自满，今后我一定更加密切地和同志们一起，在党的领导下继续努力，把工作做得更好。
