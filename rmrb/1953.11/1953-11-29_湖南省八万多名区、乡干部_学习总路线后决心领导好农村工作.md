    More Than 80,000 District and Township Cadres in Hunan Province
    Resolve to Lead Rural Work Well After Studying the General Line
    Xinhua News Agency: More than 80,000 district and township cadres in Hunan Province have been greatly encouraged by studying the general line of the state and are determined to lead rural work well and guide farmers to advance in the direction of socialism.
    In mid-November, counties in Hunan Province generally held district and township cadre meetings to listen to reports from responsible comrades of the CPC county committees on the general line of the state during the transition period, and conducted enthusiastic discussions. After listening to the reports and discussions, the district and township cadres felt that they had a "clear idea" about the direction of rural development. They reflected: In the past, they only knew that socialism was good, but they did not know how to get there. Now they have a clear understanding. Everyone expressed that they would resolutely lead the broad masses of farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation and advance in the direction of socialism. During the study, some cadres criticized their past erroneous ideas of envying some farmers in the township for making money by doing business, hoarding grain, and lending money at usurious rates. Peng Fuchu, chairman of the Jinxiu Township Farmers' Association in Changsha County, said: The capitalist road is "one rich man, dozens of poor people accompanying him," and this road must not be taken. Many cadres further realized that building socialism must concentrate efforts to realize national industrialization, actively lead farmers to produce more grain and cotton, and take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction. Xie Yonghu, militia platoon leader of Changan Township in Yueyang County, said: When the country's industry is developed and manufactures tractors for us, we will not always be following behind the ox plowing the fields, and at that time the output will be greatly increased, and life will become richer day by day. He expressed that he would sell all of his twenty-odd dan of surplus grain to the state. Chen Shulin, a township cadre from Yunquan Township in Changsha County, used the income from pig farming in the first half of this year to buy more than 2,000 jin of rice, originally planning to sell it at a high price or lend it out for interest next spring. After studying the general line of the state this time, he resolutely expressed that he would sell this grain to the state.

    湖南省八万多名区、乡干部
    学习总路线后决心领导好农村工作
    湖南省八万多区、乡干部在学习国家总路线中受到了很大鼓舞，都决心要领导好农村工作，引导农民向社会主义方向前进。
    湖南省各县在十一月中旬普遍召开了区、乡干部会议，听取中共县委负责同志关于国家在过渡时期的总路线的报告，并进行了热烈的讨论。区、乡干部在听完报告并经过讨论后，都感到对农村的发展方向心中有了“数”。他们反映：过去只知道社会主义好，但不知道怎么走法，现在心里明亮了。大家都表示要坚决领导广大农民走互助合作的道路，向社会主义方向前进。在学习中，有的干部批判了自己过去羡慕乡里有些农民做生意赚钱、囤积粮食、放高利贷的错误想法。长沙县锦绣乡农会主席彭福初说：资本主义道路是“一个富人，几十个穷人陪着他”，这是万万走不得的。许多干部并进一步认识到建设社会主义一定要集中力量实现国家的工业化，要积极领导农民多生产粮食、棉花，带头把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。岳阳县长安乡民兵中队长谢咏湖说：国家工业发达了，给我们制造拖拉机，我们就不会老跟在牛屁股后面犁田了，那个时候产量也就大大提高，生活就会一天天富裕起来。他表示一定要把自己的二十多担余粮全部卖给国家。长沙县云泉乡乡干部陈寿林，今年上半年用养猪的副业收入买进了二千多斤大米，原来打算明年春天高价出卖或放债取息；这次学习了国家总路线后，坚决表示要把这些粮食卖给国家。（新华社）
