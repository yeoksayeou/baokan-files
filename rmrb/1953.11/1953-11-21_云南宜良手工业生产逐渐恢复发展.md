Handicraft production in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, is gradually recovering and developing.

The Party and government leading organs and enterprise departments in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, are actively organizing handicraft production. The county's handicraft production has shifted from stagnation to recovery and development, powerfully promoting agricultural production. For example, of the county's original 108 blacksmith furnaces, 13 were closed. Of these, 12 have been restored, and more than 40 that were semi-operational have been fully mobilized. During the spring plowing season, they repaired more than 25,000 old farm tools for farmers and processed 6,730 new farm tools for cooperatives and trade companies. Many unemployed carpenters have taken up their tools again to repair farm tools for farmers. For example, the 25 carpenters who resumed work produced wooden farm tools, and the cooperatives helped sell 2,925 pieces in addition to what they sold themselves. The three waterwheel shops in the urban area produced 395 waterwheels in the spring alone. Stonemasons played an active role in building small-scale water conservancy projects. From January to June this year, 7,717 stonemasons were employed in the county to build and repair weirs, ponds, ditches, and dams, completing all projects on schedule, ensuring irrigation for 16,718 mu of land, and increasing irrigated land by 4,399 mu. In terms of bamboo weaving, family bamboo weaving businesses have recovered. From January to April, cooperatives helped sell more than 26,000 pieces of bamboo farm tools such as bamboo baskets and dustpans, while individual sales by the masses exceeded the cooperatives' sales by more than twofold. The quality of products has generally improved compared to the past.

Although the county's handicraft production has gradually recovered and developed, the following problems still exist: First, the relationship between public and private sectors is not yet normal. Due to the lack of understanding of the principle of "local production and sales, self-production and self-sales" by cadres of trade companies and cooperatives, they generally have a "contracting mentality." They have long-term processing contracts with the vast majority of handicraft workers in the county, paying in advance and supplying raw materials, and selling finished products through the cooperatives. As a result, it has damaged the original purchase and sale relationships of handicraft workers and fostered a serious sense of dependence among them. They turn to the cooperatives for raw materials when they don't have any, and ask the cooperatives for solutions when they can't sell their products, lacking confidence in "self-production and self-sales." In addition, there is insufficient education and supervision of handicraft workers in processing orders, resulting in failure to deliver goods on time, arrears in payments to cooperatives, and serious shoddy workmanship. More than 50% of handicraft workers are in arrears with cooperatives. At the same time, many handicraft workers do not follow the contract, and the product specifications are not met. For example, half of the plows ordered do not meet specifications, causing difficulties in the cooperatives' capital turnover. Second, the relationship between handicraft workers and farmers is not normal enough. Due to the high cost of raw materials such as steel, iron, charcoal, wood, and bamboo this year, and the high prices of products, coupled with the poor quality of some products, it has caused some farmers to be dissatisfied with handicraft workers, excluding them from agricultural production activities. Third, the relationship between masters and apprentices, labor and capital, and employers and employees is not yet normal. For example, among the twelve masters in the twelve iron furnaces in Kuangyuan Town, only one is incidentally involved in labor, while the rest are mainly involved in labor and technical guidance, but they have long been regarded as capitalists, resulting in a general unwillingness among handicraft workers to take on apprentices. Because independent handicraft workers are classified as capitalists, the relationship between masters and apprentices and employers and employees has become a labor-capital relationship, causing estrangement between masters and apprentices, and affecting production due to apprentices' lack of enthusiasm. The master's conservative thinking is also more serious, fearing that he will be unable to make a living after teaching the apprentice. The leading departments in Yiliang County are continuing to address these issues. (Feng Zhaoqin)

    云南宜良手工业生产逐渐恢复发展
    云南宜良县党政领导机关和企业部门积极组织手工业生产，全县手工业生产已由停滞不前转向恢复和发展，有力地推动了农业生产。如全县原有铁匠炉一○八盘，停业的十三盘，恢复了十二盘，半歇业的四十多盘，已全部发动起来，在春耕生产中，给农民修补旧农具二万五千多件，替合作社、贸易公司加工新农具六千七百三十件。许多停业的木工已重新拿起工具替农民修补农具。如复业的二十五个木匠，所制木农具，除自销外，合作社帮助推销了二千九百二十五件，城区三家水车铺一春就生产了水车三百九十五架。石工在兴修小型水利中起了积极作用。全县范围内今年一至六月份新修和整修堰、塘、沟及闸坝用去石工七千七百一十七个，按期完成了一切工程，保证灌溉田一万六千七百一十八亩，增加灌溉田四千三百九十九亩，篾工方面，家庭篾织业已恢复起来，一至四月单合作社即帮助推销竹箩、畚箕等竹制农具二万六千余件，而群众自销则超过合作社两倍以上。产品质量一般已较过去有了提高。
    该县的手工业生产虽已逐步得到恢复和发展，但在目前还存在如下问题：一、公私关系还不正常。由于贸易公司和合作社干部对“就地产销，自产自销”方针缺乏认识，因之，普遍存有“包干思想”，长期地和全县绝大多数手工业者订加工合同，预期付款，而且由合作社供应原料，推销成品。其结果破坏了手工业者原有的购销关系，养成了手工业者严重的依赖思想，原料没有就向合作社要，成品推销不了找合作社想办法，缺乏“自产自销”信心。加之，在加工订货中对手工业者教育督促不够，因之不按期交货，拖欠合作社货款，粗制滥造现象严重，手工业者百分之五十以上拖欠合作社账款，同时许多手工业者不按合同办事，产品规格不合，单犁一项不合规格即占订货的二分之一，致使合作社资金周转困难。二、手工业者与农民的关系不够正常。由于今年钢、铁、炭、木料、竹子等原料成本高，产品价格贵，再加上有些产品质量低劣，引起了部分农民对手工业者的不满，在农业生产活动中排斥手工业者。三、师徒关系、劳资关系、雇佣关系还不正常。如匡远镇十二盘铁炉的十二个师傅中只有一个是附带劳动，其余都是主要劳动兼技术指导，但长期把他们当资本家看待，致使手工业者普遍不愿带徒弟。由于把独立的手工业者划成资本家，因之把师徒关系、雇佣关系弄成了劳资关系，使师徒之间发生隔阂，形成师傅不敢管徒弟，徒弟劳动不积极影响生产。而师傅的保守思想也就更严重，怕把徒弟教会了以后更吃不开了。对这些问题，宜良县的领导部门正在继续加以解决。（冯兆钦）
