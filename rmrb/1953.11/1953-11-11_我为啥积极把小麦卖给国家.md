Why I Actively Sell Wheat to the State
    Said by Zhang Wucai, recorded by Cui Zhengxuan, Ma Chaojun, and Lu Wen

    My name is Zhang Wucai, and I am from Guowang Township, Fourth District, Xia County, Shanxi Province. This time, I actively responded to the call of the state and sold four piculs, three pecks, and two sheng of wheat to the state.

    Why do I want to actively sell wheat to the state? It's a long story.

    In the old society, I was a poor boy with no status. I worked hard all year round but couldn't eat my fill. Since the arrival of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, the expulsion of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the overthrow of the feudal landlords, and the implementation of land reform, I was liberated. My family was allocated twelve mu of land. The Party, fearing that we would not live well, also told us to organize. These past few years, through mutual aid and cooperation in production, we have harvested more and more grain each year. I often think that if it weren't for the leadership of the Party, how could I live such a prosperous life? Without the motherland, there would be no happiness for me, and the interests of the individual cannot be separated from the interests of the state. Today, the state purchases wheat at a reasonable price, and I should actively sell wheat to the state.

    At the same time, the contribution of the working-class brothers to the country and their support for the peasants have been truly great these past few years. I didn't understand this deeply in the past. Since last November, when the leading comrades asked me to visit the steel plant, flour mill, and state-owned farm in Taiyuan, my horizons have broadened. What moved me the most was the tractors on the state-owned farm. One person sits on it and starts the machine, and it plows, harrows, and sows; it's really convenient. After seeing it, I thought that if our China wants to transform from an agricultural country into an industrial country and live a happy life like the Soviet people, it won't work to rely solely on our peasants using cows and wooden plows; but where do tractors come from? We have to rely on the support of our working-class brothers. We peasants must support the workers with grain and raw materials. Only when industry develops and our working-class brothers can manufacture tractors in large quantities can the peasants avoid using backward production tools and live a better life.

    In reality, the workers' support for me has been considerable these past few years. For example, last year I brought back an ounce of Wang copper from Taiyuan and mixed it with the seeds for four mu of wheat. After planting, it didn't get black jaundice disease, and I harvested one picul and six pecks more wheat than the other villagers. This year, my two mu of high-yield cotton fields suffered a serious infestation of cotton aphids. Some people in the village said: Zhang Wucai may be able to get a good harvest, but he probably won't even get his money back. I used the sprayer that our group bought last year and sprayed two jin of cotton aphid soap, and in less than two days, there were no more bugs. In the autumn, I picked four hundred jin of cotton, which was three hundred and seventy jin more than the cotton of others who didn't treat the bugs. So, I thought: The workers support me, and I will sell grain to support the workers.

    Let's talk about the benefits of the state reducing the prices of industrial products. These past few years, due to the development of the state's industry, the prices of industrial products have become cheaper year by year, while the prices of agricultural products have been increasing year by year. In 1950, one dou of wheat could buy five chi of fine cloth; this year, one dou of wheat can buy six chi and three cun. For matches, in 1950, one dou of wheat could buy ten packs; this year, it can buy fifteen and a half packs. Taking the five jin of kerosene and ten packs of matches I bought this year as an example, I spent three dou less wheat than in 1950. Now, selling wheat to the state supports the construction of the state. When the Five-Year Plan is realized, industry will become even more developed, and won't we live an even more prosperous life then!

    Even in the present, I sold wheat for money, bought one hundred and twenty jin of bean cake, and jointly bought a waterwheel with the group, repaired a large cart, and expanded production, so we can harvest even more grain next year. This is truly a win-win situation that benefits both the country and myself.

    Furthermore, it is very important for the state to control grain. Last year, we suffered a disaster here. When we went to the market to buy wheat, the price was first 1,400 yuan per jin. Later, speculative merchants raised the price of wheat in order to make big money, and in a few days, it rose to 2,200 yuan. Fortunately, the government allocated a lot of grain from Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, and the price fell to 1,160 yuan per jin, meeting the needs of the masses. From this incident, I deeply felt that if the state does not control grain and the grain is manipulated by speculative merchants, the peasant masses will suffer greatly and will not live well. Therefore, I want to sell wheat to the state.

### 我为啥积极把小麦卖给国家

    我为啥积极把小麦卖给国家
    张五才说，崔政宣、马超骏、鲁文记
    我叫张五才，是山西省夏县四区郭王乡人。我这回积极响应了国家号召，把四石三斗二升小麦卖给国家。
    为什么我要积极卖给国家小麦呢？说起来话长。
    我在旧社会里是个没地位的穷小子，整年辛勤劳动，终日吃不上个饱肚子。自从来了共产党、解放军，赶跑国民党反动派，打倒封建地主，实行了土地改革，我才翻了身。家里分到十二亩土地。党怕咱们生活过不好，又叫咱组织起来。这几年经过互助生产，粮食一年比一年打得多。我时时想到，要不是党的领导，我怎能过这样的富裕生活。没有祖国就没有自己的幸福，个人的利益和国家的利益分不开。今天国家用合理的价格收购小麦，我就应该积极把小麦卖给国家。
    同时，这几年工人老大哥对国家的贡献，对农民的支援实在是大的。这点我在过去认识得不深刻。自从去年十一月领导同志叫我上太原参观了钢铁厂、面粉厂、国营农场以后，可把我眼界放大了。使我顶感动的是国营农场的拖拉机。一个人坐到上边一开动机器，耕呀，耙呀，种呀，实在方便。看了我就想，咱中国要把农业国变为工业国，过成像苏联人民那样幸福的生活，光靠咱农民使用牛和木犁可不行；可是拖拉机从那里来呢？总得靠工人老大哥支援才行。咱农民必须支援工人粮食和原料，只有工业发展了，工人老大哥能造大批拖拉机了，农民才能不使落后的生产工具，才能过更好的生活。
    实际上，这几年来，工人对我的支援也真不小。譬如去年我从太原带回一两王铜，拌了四亩麦籽，种上就没生黑疸病，比村上群众多打了一石六斗麦子。今年有二亩棉花丰产地，发生了严重的棉蚜虫。村上有的人说：张五才可要能丰产哩，恐怕连本也捞不回来。我就用我组去年买的喷雾器打了二斤棉蚜皂，不两天就没有虫了；秋天摘了四百斤花，比别人不治虫的棉花多摘了三百七十斤。所以我想：工人支援了我，我要卖粮食支援工人。
    就说国家降低工业品价格的好处吧。这几年来，由于国家工业的发展，工业品价格一年比一年便宜，农产品价格却一年比一年在提高。一九五零年一斗麦买五尺细布，今年一斗麦就能买六尺三寸。火柴，一九五零年一斗麦买十包，今年买十五包半。拿今年我买的五斤煤油、十包火柴两项来算吧，就比一九五零年少出三斗麦子。现在把小麦卖给国家，支援了国家建设，把五年建设计划实现了，到那时工业就更发达起来，还不是生活过的更富裕吗！
    就以现下说，我把小麦卖成钱，买了一百二十斤豆饼，和组里伙买了一辆水车，修好一辆大车，扩大了生产，明年就能更多打些粮食。这实在是有利国家，又利自己的两全其美的事情。
    再说，国家掌握粮食非常重要。去年我们这里受了灾害，到集上买小麦，每斤先是一千四百元，后来投机私商为了挣大钱，高抬麦价，不几日涨到二千二百元。幸亏政府从湖南、湖北等省调拨来很多粮食，每斤才落到一千一百六十元，满足了群众的需要。从这个事情中我就深深感到，国家不掌握粮食，粮食让投机私商操纵起来，农民群众是会吃大亏的，过不好生活的。所以，我要把小麦卖给国家。
