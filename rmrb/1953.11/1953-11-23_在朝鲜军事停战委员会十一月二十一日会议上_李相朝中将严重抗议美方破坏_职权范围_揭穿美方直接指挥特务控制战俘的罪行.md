Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 22nd: On November 7th, the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) seized a US military radio that the US side attempted to smuggle into the Dongchang-ri POW camp. On the same day, the Indian custodial troops also discovered that so-called "nurses" from the US 64th Field Hospital had shouted and communicated with US special agents in Camp No. 49 of the Dongchang-ri POW camp, and also transmitted letters. The Indian sentry stationed there intercepted this letter from the special agents. These illegal acts by the US side once again irrefutably demonstrate that the US side is directly instructing a large number of Chiang and Li special agents to carry out various sabotage activities in the Dongchang-ri POW camp.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on November 21st, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, lodged a strong protest with the US side regarding its consistent illegal acts of seriously undermining the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Armistice Agreement, pointing out that these illegal acts by the US side cannot but endanger the entire Korean armistice and peace in Korea. The Korean and Chinese side issued a serious warning to the US side: the US side must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences inevitably arising from these illegal acts.

The full text of Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao's speech is as follows:

"On November 16, 1953, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission formally notified our side that the Indian custodial troops discovered on November 7th a military radio that your side had mixed into the food provided for the Dongchang-ri POW camp in an attempt to smuggle it into the camp. The radio was sealed in a large barrel of baking powder, and the cardboard box containing the radio was marked with the words 'US Army Unit 8239'. On November 7th, the Indian custodial troops also discovered that the so-called 'nurses' of the US 64th Field Hospital in the Dongchang-ri POW camp had shouted and communicated with special agents in nearby Camp No. 49 and transmitted letters. The Indian sentry stationed there intercepted this letter from the special agents. Regarding these serious violations of the 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission', the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has protested to your side and demanded that you immediately cease these illegal activities.

The illegal activities of your side revealed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission once again irrefutably demonstrate that you are directly instructing a large number of Chiang and Li special agents to carry out various sabotage activities in the POW camps. In fact, the two incidents raised by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are only individual cases of your illegal activities. POWs who broke through the bloody rule of your special agents and returned to our side have already revealed that you illegally deployed special agents into the POW camps and then took various means to illegally maintain contact with the special agents. You have continuously smuggled radio equipment into the Dongchang-ri POW camp. Radio equipment supplied by you has been installed in Camps No. 9, 25, 34, 35, 40, 48, 49, 51, and 53 of the Dongchang-ri POW camp. Your special agents Wang Shunqing, Zhang Zunxian, Han Yinsong, Chi Jicheol, and Wen Chonghao, the so-called 'regimental commanders' and 'battalion commanders,' listen to your instructions on how to carry out various sabotage activities on time every day according to the codes compiled by you. You constantly mix special agent letters into the logistical support you provide to the Dongchang-ri POW camp, and mix weapons supplied to the special agents. The US 64th Field Hospital, which you provide to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, is even more of a base camp for special agents arranged by you. You use a large number of Chiang and Li special agents as so-called 'interpreters,' 'nurses,' and so-called 'medical personnel.' Chiang Kai-shek special agent 'Teacher Ma,' Ge Yunfei, Cai Peipei, and Deng Hongxun and Li Seung-man special agents Kim Seong-rok, Shin Chang-ho, Lee Il-su, and Kang Geun-ok in the US 64th Field 'Hospital' directly receive 'instructions' from your special agent agencies and issue orders to the special agents in all camps in Dongchang-ri. The special agents in each camp come and go between the camps and the hospital in the manner of seeking medical treatment or hospitalization to maintain contact with you. You constantly use flag signals and signals to the special agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp from Hill 155 and its vicinity near the Dongchang-ri POW camp in your military control area to maintain contact with them. Your special agents have also impersonated garbage truck drivers, entering and leaving various camps to pass on information. Your special agents Park Dong-hyuk and Han Seong-tae, who infiltrated the POW camp, even frequently travel between the POW camp and Seoul to receive 'instructions' and then arrange sabotage activities in the Dongchang-ri POW camp.

The 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' clearly stipulates that the original detaining party must completely relinquish control of the prisoners of war, and neither party shall maintain control and influence over the prisoners of war in the name of logistical and medical support. However, you directly command special agents to implement bloody terrorist rule over the prisoners of war, deprive the prisoners of war of their right to be repatriated, and attempt to achieve the despicable goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

During the armistice negotiations, your long-term insistence on forcibly detaining prisoners of war caused a long-term stalemate on the POW issue. Only under the strong pressure of the Korean-Chinese side and peace-loving people all over the world did you have to finally abandon your unreasonable demand for forcibly detaining prisoners of war and sign the 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.' The 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' is an important part of the Armistice Agreement. Your Li Seung-man group's illegal act of forcibly detaining more than 27,000 of our captured personnel before the signing of the Armistice Agreement once endangered the entire armistice negotiations, and this issue has not yet been resolved. Now your wanton sabotage of the 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' cannot but endanger the entire Korean armistice and peace in Korea. I lodge a strong protest with you against your illegal acts of seriously undermining the 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' of the Armistice Agreement, and issue a serious warning to you. You must be fully responsible for all serious consequences inevitably arising from these illegal acts."

    在朝鲜军事停战委员会十一月二十一日会议上
    李相朝中将严重抗议美方破坏“职权范围”
    揭穿美方直接指挥特务控制战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十二日电】十一月七日，中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队查获美方企图偷运入东场里战俘营内的美军军用无线电机一架。同日，印度看管部队又发现美军第六十四野战医院的所谓“护士”曾与东场里战俘营第四十九号营场的美方特务喊话联系和传递信件，值勤该处的印军岗哨并截获了这封特务信件。美方的这种种非法行为，又一次无可辩驳地说明了美方正直接指使大批蒋、李特务在东场里战俘营中进行种种破坏行动。
    在十一月二十一日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将就美方一贯严重破坏停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的非法行为向美方提出严重抗议，指出美方这种非法行为将不能不危害整个朝鲜停战与朝鲜的和平。朝中方面严重警告美方：美方这种非法行为所必然引起的一切严重后果，必须由美方完全负责。
    李相朝中将的发言全文如下：
    “一九五三年十一月十六日中立国遣返委员会正式通知我方：印度看管部队于十一月七日查获你方混在为东场里战俘营所提供的粮食内企图偷运入营内的军用无线电机一架。该无线电机被封藏于一大桶发酵粉内，装有无线电机的纸匣上面注有美军八二三九部队的字样。印度看管部队并于十一月七日发现你方在东场里战俘营的美军第六十四野战医院的所谓‘护士’，曾与附近的第四十九号营场的特务喊话联系，兼传递信件。值勤该处的印军岗哨并截获了这封特务信件。对于这些严重违反‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’的事件，中立国遣返委员会已向你方提出抗议，并要求你方立即停止这种非法活动。
    中立国遣返委员会所揭露的你方非法活动，又一次无可辩驳地说明了你方直接指使大批蒋李特务在战俘营中进行种种破坏活动。事实上，中立国遣返委员会所提出的两项事件还只是你方非法活动中的个别案件。突破你方特务血腥统治归还我方的战俘，早已揭露了你方非法布置特务混入战俘营后，又采取各种手段非法保持与特务的联系。你方不断偷运无线电设备入东场里战俘营，在东场里战俘营第九、二十五、三十四、三十五、四十、四十八、四十九、五十一、五十三等营场内，均设置有你方所供给的无线电设备。所谓‘联队长’‘大队长’的你方特务王顺清、张遵贤、韩殷松、池基哲、文重浩等根据你方所编定的密码，每天按时听取你方关于如何进行各种破坏活动的指示。你方在向东场里战俘营所提供的后勤支援中不断混入特务信件，并混入供给特务的武器。你方向中立国遣返委员会所提供的美军第六十四野战医院，更是你方布置下的特务的大本营。你方用大批蒋李特务充当所谓
  ‘译员’、‘护士’及所谓‘医务人员’。美军第六十四野战‘医院’中蒋介石特务‘马老师’、葛云飞、蔡培培、邓鸿勋等与李承晚特务金成禄、申昌浩、李一守、姜根玉等直接从你方特务机关接受‘指示’，并向东场里全部营场中的特务发号施令。各营场的特务均以看病或住院的方式往来于营场与医院之间，与你方保持联络。你方在你方军事控制地区内邻近东场里战俘营的一五五高地及其附近向东场里战俘营内的特务不断打旗语、发信号，保持与他们的联系。你方特务又曾冒充垃圾车的司机，出入各营场，传递信息。混入战俘营的你方特务朴东赫、韩成泰等甚至于经常来往于战俘营与汉城之间，接受‘指示’，再向东场里战俘营内布置破坏活动。
    ‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’明确规定：原拘留一方对战俘的控制必须彻底解除，双方不得以后勤与医药支援的名义保持对战俘的控制与影响。但你方却直接指挥特务，对战俘实施血腥的恐怖统治，剥夺战俘被遣返的权利，企图借此达到强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙目的。
    停战谈判中由于你方长期坚持强迫扣留战俘的主张，曾经造成了战俘问题上长时期的僵局，只是在朝中方面和全世界爱好和平人民的强大压力下，你方才不得不最后放弃了强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，签订了‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’。‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’是停战协定中的一个重要部分，你方李承晚集团在停战协定签字前强迫扣留二万七千余名我方被俘人员的非法行为，曾使整个停战谈判陷于危殆，这一问题至今尚未解决，现在你方又恣意破坏‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’的非法行为，将不能不危害整个朝鲜停战与朝鲜的和平。对于你方严重破坏停战协定‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’的非法行为，我向你提出强硬抗议，并向你提出严重的警告，对于你方这种非法行为所必然引起的一切严重后果，必须完全由你方负责。”
