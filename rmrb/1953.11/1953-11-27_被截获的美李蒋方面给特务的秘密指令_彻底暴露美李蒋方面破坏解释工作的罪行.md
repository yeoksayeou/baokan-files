Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 26th. Special correspondent Wu Min reports: The secret instructions given by the US, ROK, and Chiang sides to the special agents in the neutral nations' custodial camp, intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces, thoroughly expose the various criminal acts of the US, ROK, and Chiang sides in directing special agents to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the explanation work. The publication of these secret instructions is a heavy blow to the American propaganda machine, which has been slandering the Korean and Chinese sides for delaying the explanation work.

    This secret instruction proves that the current situation where special agents are preventing prisoners of war from leaving the camp to attend explanations, thus halting the explanation work, is entirely the result of the US, ROK, and Chiang sides' instructions. At the same time, the instruction also exposes the major conspiracy of the US, ROK, and Chiang sides to forcibly seize prisoners of war. This secret instruction orders the special agents not to listen to the explanations, and assures them that even if they do not listen to the explanations, the explanation period will not be extended. The instruction also states that if the explanation period is extended, Syngman Rhee has made preparations to forcibly seize the prisoners of war. This is completely consistent with the statements made by US Secretary of State Dulles, Far East US Army Commander Hull, and Swiss representative Däniker on the issue of the explanation period. From this, it can be clearly seen the role played by the US State Department, the US Army authorities, and the "neutral" Swiss representative in this conspiracy.

    This secret instruction proves that because more than two hundred prisoners of war have been repatriated and have exposed the US plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the US has suffered a terrible defeat politically and morally, and has completely lost its "face." This secret instruction honestly admits that the reason why the US, ROK, and Chiang sides are directing special agents to refuse to let prisoners of war listen to the explanations and are preparing to "release" them after the Indian troops have guarded the prisoners of war for ninety days is because only in this way can the US "maintain" its "face." In other words, only in this way can more prisoners of war be prevented from requesting repatriation, so that the US plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war will not be completely defeated. This is a great irony for the American propaganda machine, which is desperately promoting the "victory" of American "psychological warfare."

    This secret instruction proves that all the Rhee and Chiang special agents in the prisoner of war camps are directly under the command of Syngman Rhee himself, Won Yong-duk, the commander of the Rhee gang's military police, and Wang Dongyuan, the so-called "ambassador" of the Kuomintang gang stationed in Seoul. There is a very close connection between Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang gang in directing special agents in the prisoner of war camps. And Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang gang, as is well known, are carrying out Washington's orders. This secret instruction also proves that the so-called "battalion commanders" in the prisoner of war camps, the so-called "chiefs" and "deputy chiefs" of the special agent organization "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," are all professional special agents dispatched by the US, ROK, and Chiang sides. They pose as prisoners of war and sneak into the camps, and proclaim themselves as so-called "prisoner of war representatives," openly carrying out various conspiracy activities in the camps to undermine the explanation work and abuse and murder prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese sides have long pointed out that these special agents directed by the US, ROK, and Chiang sides are not prisoners of war and have demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission purge these special agents. This secret instruction proves that the demands of the Korean and Chinese sides are completely correct.

    This secret instruction confirms the facts revealed by the repatriated prisoners of war: the 64th Field Hospital provided by the United States is the command and liaison center for US special agents in the camps. The secret instruction tells special agents Han Yin-song and Chi Ji-zhe that future liaison will be carried out through radio broadcasts and Kim Sung-rok, the head of the special agents in the hospital.

    This secret instruction also instructs the Rhee and Chiang special agents to boldly "clean up internally those who disobey orders," and instructs them to "kill those who are willing to return to the north, because this will leak secrets." This proves that the masterminds behind the murders of prisoners of war who requested repatriation in the prisoner of war camps by Rhee and Chiang special agents are the US side. The US side is the instigator and accomplice of these appalling murders, and should bear direct responsibility for these atrocities. However, according to the announcement made by the Indian Custodial Forces on the 25th, the seven special agent murderers who were arrested for murdering prisoner of war Zhang Zilong actually requested to obtain "defense lawyers" from the "United Nations side" during the trial, that is, they requested murderers to defend murderers. This is clearly an attempt to turn the trial into a farce so that these murderers can escape justice.

    This secret instruction also confirms that there are a large number of radio receivers in the prisoner of war camps. These radios were given to the special agents by the US side or were hidden in the supplies provided by the US side. The US, ROK, and Chiang sides are now broadcasting coded instructions and engaging in incitement to the special agents through radio stations every day. This secret instruction also confirms that the so-called "demonstrations against explanation" and the so-called "petitions" against explanation that occurred in the prisoner of war camps were all carried out by Rhee and Chiang special agents coercing the prisoners of war, and these special agents were acting on the orders of Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-duk, and Wang Dongyuan. The US, ROK, and Chiang sides are the direct commanders of the special agents in the prisoner of war camps, which has been irrefutably proven by this secret instruction.

    It can be seen from this secret instruction that because of the obstruction of the Swiss and Swedish representatives, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have failed to exercise their legitimate power to sanction the special agents who use violence to threaten prisoners of war, which has become an excellent support for the US, ROK, and Chiang sides to encourage special agents to carry out sabotage activities. In this secret instruction, the US, ROK, and Chiang sides want the special agents to carry out "anti-explanation demonstrations and submit protest letters," and tell them: "The Indian army has also said that force cannot be used against South Korean anti-Communist youth."

    This secret instruction proves that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission still does not exercise its legitimate power to sanction the special agents, the explanation work will never be able to proceed, and the "Terms of Reference" will be completely destroyed.

    被截获的美李蒋方面给特务的秘密指令
    彻底暴露美李蒋方面破坏解释工作的罪行
   【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：印度看管部队所截获的美李蒋方面给中立国看管营场内的特务分子的秘密指令，彻底暴露了美李蒋方面指挥特务强迫扣留战俘、破坏解释工作的种种罪恶行为。这个秘密指令的公布，给了那些诬蔑朝中方面拖延解释工作的美国宣传机器以沉重的打击。
    这个秘密指令证明，目前特务不让战俘出营场听取解释，使解释工作因而停顿，完全是美李蒋方面指使的结果，同时指令也暴露了美李蒋方面用武力劫夺战俘的重大阴谋。这个秘密指令命令特务们不应听解释，并且向他们保证，即使不听解释，也不会延长解释期限。指令还说，如果解释期限延长，李承晚已作好了用武力劫夺战俘的准备工作。这是和美国国务卿杜勒斯、远东美军总司令赫尔以及瑞士代表邓尼克对解释期限问题所发表的谈话完全一致的。从这里可以清楚地看出美国国务院、美国陆军当局以及“中立”的瑞士代表在这个阴谋中所起的作用。
    这个秘密指令证明：由于已经有二百多名战俘遣返归来并且揭露了美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，美方在政治上和道义上已经遭到惨重的失败，丧尽了“体面”。这个秘密指令老实承认，美李蒋方面所以要指使特务拒绝让战俘听取解释，并且准备在印度部队看管战俘九十天之后将他们“释放”，是因为只有这样才可以“维持”美国的“体面”，换句话说，只有这样才可以避免有更多的战俘要求遣返，从而使美国强迫扣留战俘的阴谋不致遭到彻底失败。这对于那些拚命宣传美国“心理战”“胜利”的美国宣传机器，真是一个极妙的讽刺。
    这个秘密指令证明，所有战俘营中的李、蒋特务，是直接受李承晚本人、李匪帮的宪兵总司令官元容德，以及国民党匪帮驻汉城的所谓“大使”王东原的指挥的。在李承晚和国民党匪帮之间，在指挥战俘营中的特务方面有着极密切的联系。而李承晚和国民党匪帮，如所周知，是执行着华盛顿的命令的。这个秘密指令也证明：战俘营各营场中的所谓“大队长”，特务组织“反共青年团”的所谓 “团长”、“副团长”之流，都是美李蒋方面所派遣的职业特务，他们冒充战俘混入营场，并且自封为所谓“战俘代表”，公然在营场内进行各种破坏解释工作、虐杀战俘的阴谋活动。朝中方面早已指出，美李蒋方面所指挥的这些特务并不是战俘，并且要求中立国遣返委员会肃清这些特务。这个秘密指令证明朝中方面的要求是完全正确的。
    这个秘密指令证实了已经遣返的战俘所揭露的事实：美国所提供的第六十四野战医院是美方特务在营场中的指挥和联络中心。秘密指令告诉特务韩银松和池基哲说，以后的联络将利用广播和在医院中的特务头子金成禄来进行。
    这个秘密指令还指示李、蒋特务放手大胆地“在内部肃清不服从命令的分子”，并且指示他们“必须杀掉愿回北部的家伙，因为这会泄露秘密的缘故”。这就证明李、蒋特务在战俘营中谋杀要求遣返的战俘，其幕后的主使人正是美方。美方是这些骇人听闻的谋杀案的主使者和同谋者，对这些暴行应负直接的责任。可是据印度看管部队在二十五日宣布，已被逮捕的谋杀战俘张子龙的七名特务凶手，竟然要求在审讯时从“联合国方面”得到“辩护律师”，也就是要求由杀人犯来给杀人犯辩护。这显然是企图将审讯变为一幕滑稽剧，以便使这些凶手得以逃脱正义的制裁。
    这个秘密指令还证实了在战俘营里有着大量的无线电收音机，这些收音机是美方交给特务分子带进去，或者夹藏在美方所提供的供应品中间带进去的。美李蒋方面现在通过广播电台，每天向特务广播密码指示和进行煽动。这个秘密指令也证实了在战俘营里所发生的所谓“反对解释示威”，以及提出反对解释的所谓“请愿书”，都是李、蒋特务胁迫着战俘干出来的，而这些特务又是奉了李承晚、元容德和王东原的命令进行的。美李蒋方面是战俘营中的特务的直接指挥者，已经由这个秘密指示中得到了无可抵赖的证明。
    从这个秘密指令中可以看出，由于瑞士、瑞典代表的阻挠，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队未能对使用暴力威胁战俘的特务行使制裁他们的合法权力，这已经成为美李蒋方面鼓励特务进行破坏行动的绝好支持。美李蒋方面在这个秘密指令中要特务们进行“反解释示威和提出抗议书”，并且告诉他们：“印度军也说过，对韩国反共青年不能使用武力。”
    这个秘密指令证明：中立国遣返委员会如果对特务仍不行使制裁他们的合法权力，解释工作必将永远无法进行，“职权范围”必将破坏无遗。
