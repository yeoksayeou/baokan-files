    Anhui Provincial Department of Education's Regulations on Elementary School Tuition Standards Are Too Tardy
    Wu Liangjie of the CPC Zongyang Town Committee of Hudong County, Anhui Province, writes: The Anhui Provincial Department of Education's regulations on elementary school tuition standards are very tardy. This year, elementary schools in our province started on February 21st, but the Provincial Department of Education had not yet stipulated the tuition standards at that time. Each district urged the county Bureau of Culture and Education, and the county urged the Special Commissioner's Office. The Commissioner's Office replied: the Provincial Department of Education has not stipulated them yet, so temporarily charge according to last year's standards. It was not until early March that the Provincial Department of Education stipulated the elementary school tuition standards. By the time the rural elementary schools received the notice, school had already been in session for almost a month, and most of the tuition had already been collected. However, because the tuition standards in the regulations were higher than last year's, the schools had to carry out another tuition collection, mobilizing the students to pay the difference. This caused dissatisfaction among many parents. This semester, elementary schools in our county started on September 1st, and the Provincial Department of Education again failed to stipulate the tuition standards in a timely manner. The schools had no choice but to temporarily charge according to the standards of the previous semester. After being urged at each level, the rural elementary schools only received the notice of increased fees in mid-September, which added a lot of difficulties to the work. The Anhui Provincial Department of Education should conduct an inspection into the reasons for the tardiness in stipulating tuition standards.

    安徽省人民政府教育厅规定小学学费标准太不及时
    中共安徽省湖东县棕阳镇委员会吴良杰来信：安徽省人民政府教育厅对小学收费标准规定得很不及时。今年上半年，我省小学都在二月二十一日开学，但当时省教育厅还没有规定收费标准。各区都向县文教科催问，县催问专署，专署答复：省教育厅没有规定下来，暂时按去年标准收费。直到三月初，省教育厅才规定了小学收费标准。乡村小学接到通知时，开学已快一个月了，学费大部分已收清。但因规定中的收费标准比去年的高，学校只得又办理一次收费工作，动员学生补缴。这就引起很多家长不满。这学期，我县小学在九月一日开学，省教育厅又没有及时规定收费标准。学校只得暂时仍先按上学期标准收费。经逐级催问后，乡村小学在九月中旬才收到增费的通知，工作增加了不少困难。安徽省教育厅对规定学费标准不及时的原因应作一次检查。
