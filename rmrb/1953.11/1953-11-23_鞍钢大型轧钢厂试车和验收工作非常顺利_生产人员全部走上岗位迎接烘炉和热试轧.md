Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 22nd: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's newly built large rolling mill is nearing completion. Trial runs and acceptance work are progressing smoothly, and production personnel are working day and night to practice operating techniques. With the aspirations of the people of the whole country, China's largest mechanized and automated rolling mill in history is about to be heated and hot test rolled.

In recent days, the trial and acceptance work of the large rolling mill has been proceeding very smoothly thanks to the efforts of the factory's employees and the assistance of Soviet experts. Most of the tens of thousands of tons of rolling machinery and precision electrical equipment have already undergone local test runs. In the main electrical room, the most complex and enormous main drive motor has begun to rotate. Tests in recent days have proven that the installation quality of this largest motor exceeds the design standards. The design requirement was that the vibration tolerance should not exceed five, but now the tolerance is only 0.5. Thanks to the joint efforts of basic construction and production personnel, the trial run and acceptance work has been particularly rapid. Now the managers of the large rolling mill and the mechanical installation engineering company have signed more than one hundred "technical completion" and other handover documents for equipment. Over 95 percent of the quality is excellent, and the remaining quality is also very good.

Currently, all production personnel of the large rolling mill have taken up their production posts. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they are working day and night to practice operating techniques. In the main electrical room, production workers wearing white work clothes are constantly observing the pointers on the voltmeters and ammeters on the automatic electrical switches. In the heating furnace workshop, it is already piled with coarse steel tires transported from the roughing mill, and firewood for furnace baking has been delivered. Workers operating the rolling mill are taking advantage of the breaks during trial runs to intensify their practice of changing rolls and installing guide plates. All production preparations are being accelerated, various production tools have been prepared, and production personnel are full of confidence to welcome the day of furnace baking and hot test rolling.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂试车和验收工作非常顺利
    生产人员全部走上岗位迎接烘炉和热试轧
    【新华社鞍山二十二日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂即将全部竣工，试车和验收工作正在顺利进行，生产人员日夜加紧练习操作技术。在全国人民的热望中，我国历史上最大的机械化自动化的轧钢厂就要烘炉和进行热试轧了。
    这几天来，大型轧钢厂的试车和验收工作，在该厂职工的努力和苏联专家帮助下，进行得非常顺利。一万数千吨重的轧钢机械和精密的电气设备，绝大部分都已经过局部试车。在主电室里，最复杂而巨大的主传动马达已经开始转动，几天来试车证明：这个最大的马达的安装质量超过了设计标准，设计要求震动公差不得超过五道，可是现在公差只差零点五道。由于基本建设和生产人员的共同努力，试车和验收工作特别迅速，现在大型轧钢厂和机械安装工程公司经理等已在一百多份设备的“技术竣工”等交工单上签了字，百分之九十五以上质量都是优等，其余的质量也很良好。
    目前大型轧钢厂的生产人员已全部走上生产岗位，在苏联专家帮助下正日夜加紧练习着操作技术，在主电室里，穿着白色作业服的生产工人，时刻观察着自动电气开关上的电压、电流表的指针；在加热炉车间里，已堆满了从初车厂那边运送过来的粗大的钢胎，烘炉用的木柴已经运到；操作轧钢机的工人们利用试车的空隙时间，加紧练习着换轧辊和装导卫板的工作，一切生产的准备工作正在加紧进行，各种生产工具都已准备妥当，生产人员们都满怀信心地来迎接烘炉和热试轧的日子。
