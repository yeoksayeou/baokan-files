Xinhua News Agency, November 11th Dispatch from London: According to a TASS report from London: The Federation of British Industries (the largest business organization in Britain) recently held a conference on export trade issues in Buxton. The chairman of the association, Harry Pilkington, delivered a speech at the meeting, calling for the lifting of trade restrictions between East and West.

Pilkington said: "Recently, we have witnessed firsthand that Britain has successively lost markets as a result of trade restrictions. We demand to compete on equal terms in the global market... We believe that only the government can solve these problems, but the government is not making sufficient efforts now, lacks initiative, and does not have a clear enough understanding of the consequences that this situation will lead to. We firmly demand concrete improvements in this regard." Pilkington criticized the US policy of restricting trade, which made it difficult for British goods to be sold on the US market.

Speaking about trade between East and West, Pilkington said: "I think the government should provide industrial representatives with a clearer explanation of what policies the government is adopting in this area, and propose some ways to develop and encourage this trade."

On November 2nd, the conference released a statement on the British Federation of Industries' export policy. The statement reads: "First, the current situation of British entrepreneurs is that they are selling more goods than the market can immediately accommodate, and a series of problems arise here. Now, in reality, no entrepreneur can choose the market. They have to go into whatever market they can find. Second, under no circumstances should the long-established connections between entrepreneurs and certain markets be harmed, but to comply with this condition, it is necessary to expand the market as much as possible... Third, as the British pound's situation improves, it is becoming increasingly unnecessary to give priority to certain markets, namely the dollar area markets."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 12th: The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 10th that a group of British businessmen openly resisted the British government's measures to restrict East-West trade. The report said, "Due to competition from West Germany and other countries, British businessmen are in danger of losing markets, so they are demanding a general relaxation of trade restrictions."

The report said that forty prominent company managers are currently preparing to go to Moscow, and Eden intends to prevent them from going, but they are unanimously opposed. Seeing the recent export figures of West Germany to the Soviet Union and China, they cannot but adopt a firm attitude.

Representatives of the automobile industry questioned why the measures restricting the export of trucks and other vehicles have not yet been lifted.

    美国歧视性的贸易政策严重损害了英国的出口贸易 
    英国企业界人士要求取消东西方贸易限制
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工业联合会（英国最大的企业组织）最近在巴克斯顿召开出口贸易问题会议，该会主席哈里·皮尔金顿在会上发表演说，号召取消东西方之间的贸易限制。
    皮尔金顿说：“最近我们亲眼看到，由于限制贸易的结果，英国接连地失掉了市场。我们要求在全世界市场上、在平等的条件下进行竞争……我们认为，唯有政府能解决这些问题，但现在政府却没有作充分的努力，进取心也不够，而且对于这种情况将导致的后果认识也不够明确。我们坚决要求在这一方面作具体的改进。”皮尔金顿斥责美国限制贸易的政策，使英国商品难以向美国市场上销售。
    皮尔金顿谈到东西方之间的贸易时说道：“我认为，政府应该向工业界代表作比较明确的解释，政府在这一方面究竟采取怎样的政策，并应提出一些办法，来发展和鼓励这种贸易。”
    十一月二日，会议发表了英国工业联合会出口政策的声明。声明中写道：“第一、目前英国企业家所处的情况是：他们出售的货物要比市场所能立即容纳的多，一系列的问题就发生在这里。现在，实际上，任何一个企业家都无法选择市场。他们不得不见到一个市场就钻进去。第二、在任何情况下都不应使企业家与某些市场所长期建立起来的联系受到损害，但是，要遵守这个条件，就必须尽可能地扩大市场……第三、随着英国英镑情况的好转，越来越没有必要给某些市场，即美元区市场以优先了。”
    【新华社柏林十二日电】十日伦敦“工人日报”报道：一批英国商人公开反抗英国政府限制东西方贸易的措施。该报说，“由于西德和其他国家的竞争，英国商人大有丧失市场的危险，因此他们要求普遍放宽贸易限制。”
    该报说，目前有四十名著名的公司经理正准备到莫斯科去，艾登打算阻挠他们前往而遭到他们一致的反对。看到西德最近对苏联和中国出口的数字，他们不能不采取坚决的态度。
    汽车工业的代表人士质问，为什么限制输出货车和其他车辆的措施还不取消。
