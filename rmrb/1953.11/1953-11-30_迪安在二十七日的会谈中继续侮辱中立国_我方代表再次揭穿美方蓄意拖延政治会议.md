Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: At the bilateral talks on the political conference issue on November 27th, U.S. representative Dean once again played a trick to deceive world public opinion. He refused four times to answer the questions raised by the Korean and Chinese side: Should neutral nations participate in the political conference? At the same time, he put forward eleven so-called "understandings" and a "comprehensive list" of countries participating in the political conference, asking the Korean and Chinese side to confirm them, attempting to use these things to cover up his conspiracy to delay and obstruct the talks.

In these eleven so-called "understandings," Dean agreed to the Korean and Chinese side's suggestion that the political conference should take the form of equal bilateral meetings, but he immediately repeated anti-Soviet slanders, falsely accusing the Soviet Union of not being a neutral country, and insisted on listing the Soviet Union as a belligerent, although he never dared to say that the Soviet Union and the United States were belligerent countries. At the meeting, he gave the Korean and Chinese side a so-called "comprehensive list" of countries participating in the political conference, in which the U.S. side included sixteen countries that sent troops to invade Korea plus South Korea, and attributed the only neutral country, the Soviet Union, on the list to the Korean and Chinese side. The Korean and Chinese side immediately returned this "list" to Dean on the spot and denounced it as absurd. In his eleven so-called "understandings," Dean incoherently demanded that all decisions of the political conference be binding on the Soviet Union, and advocated that the vote on any item on the agenda, in addition to the two sides, must also be approved by the Soviet Union to be effective. Dean's stubborn and deliberate slander of the Soviet Union, in addition to attempting to hinder the progress of the bilateral talks, its ultimate goal is clearly to exclude the Soviet Union from the political conference, so that the United States can wantonly manipulate and undermine the political conference.

In the past few days of meetings, Dean has repeatedly insulted neutral countries, calling neutral countries "pawns" in the "political game." The so-called eleven "understandings" put forward by Dean today have reached the peak of insulting neutral countries. Dean called neutral countries "observers without voting rights." According to Dean's opinion, these neutral countries "should only have the right to speak at the meeting on agenda items agreed upon by both parties, at times, places, meetings, and committees unanimously agreed upon by both parties, and in a manner unanimously agreed upon by both parties, and can only speak on issues that both parties intend to discuss at the meeting," and they have no "right to participate in the political conference outside the above-mentioned prescribed scope." It is obvious that Dean wants to make these neutral countries into dumb puppets decorating the political conference. As long as the U.S. side does not agree to let them speak on all agenda items, they will not be able to attend the meeting at all. Even if they get the opportunity to attend and speak, they will be subject to various restrictions, and even their way of speaking must be in a prescribed format. This is simply making fun of neutral countries, which is the so-called "respect" for neutral countries that Dean keeps talking about. Dean attempted to completely eliminate the coordinating role of neutral countries in the political conference through these insulting restrictions, in order to achieve the goal of not allowing neutral countries to participate in essence. From the various restrictions put forward by Dean, it can be clearly seen that the only reason why the U.S. side opposes the participation of neutral countries in the political conference is that they are afraid that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will coordinate the opinions of both sides at the meeting, so that the United States cannot wantonly carry out sabotage.

Dean's eleven so-called "understandings" also exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy regarding the political conference. He agreed to the Korean and Chinese side's suggestion that all resolutions of the political conference should be made with the unanimous agreement of both parties, saying that "each government participating in the political conference should only be bound by the agreements it participates in," but he also advocated that "each side vote as a unit." What does this self-contradictory proposition of Dean mean? This means that at the political conference, the United States will monopolize the vote on behalf of the sixteen countries on the U.S. side and the Syngman Rhee clique, but any one of these sixteen countries and the Syngman Rhee clique can not participate in the agreements made after the vote. In this way, the votes have been cast and the agreements have been reached, but whether to comply or not is still up to them. This is obviously an attempt to prepare conditions for Syngman Rhee to refuse a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Dean's opinions on the issue of neutral countries in these eleven so-called "understandings" are completely contrary to the opinions of the Korean and Chinese side, but Dean blatantly lied and said that these eleven "understandings" "summarize many of your replies and statements, in which some agreements have been reached between the two sides, and some may be reached if other issues can be satisfactorily clarified," and asked the Korean and Chinese side to confirm them. Dean attempted to use this lie to deceive world public opinion and shirk the responsibility of the U.S. side for delaying the talks. But Dean's lies cannot find a market. The Korean and Chinese side has already pointed out the absurdity of Dean's proposition on the issue of neutral countries on the spot. Dean's adoption of such a playful attitude towards the issue of the Korean political conference, which is of concern to the whole world, and his deliberate slander of the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace, and insult to neutral countries, can only make the whole world see more clearly that it is the U.S. side that is deliberately delaying the convening of the political conference.

### 迪安在二十七日的会谈中继续侮辱中立国  我方代表再次揭穿美方蓄意拖延政治会议

    迪安在二十七日的会谈中继续侮辱中立国
    我方代表再次揭穿美方蓄意拖延政治会议
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美国代表迪安在二十七日关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中又玩了一次欺骗世界舆论的手段。他四次拒绝回答朝中方面提出的责问：中立国究竟是否应该参加政治会议？同时，他却提出了十一项所谓“谅解”，以及参加政治会议的国家的“综合名单”，要求朝中方面加以证实，企图用这些东西来掩饰自己拖延和阻挠会谈的阴谋。
    在这十一项所谓“谅解”中，迪安同意朝中方面关于政治会议应采取双方对等会议的形式的建议，但是他马上重复反苏谰言，诬蔑苏联不是中立国，硬要把苏联列为交战一方，虽然他始终不敢说苏联和美国是交战国。他在会上交给朝中方面一张参加政治会议的国家的所谓“综合名单”，其中属于美方的是十六个出兵侵略朝鲜的国家加上南朝鲜，而把名单中唯一的一个中立国苏联归属在朝中方面。朝中方面当场将这张“名单”退还给迪安，并斥之为荒谬。迪安在他的十一项所谓“谅解”中语无伦次地要求政治会议的一切决定对于苏联具有约束力，并且主张会议对于任何一项议程的表决，除了双方以外，还要得到苏联的同意才有效。迪安如此顽固地蓄意诽谤苏联，除了企图阻碍双方会谈的进展而外，其最终目的显然是要排斥苏联于政治会议之外，以便美国得以放肆地操纵和破坏政治会议。
    在过去几天的会议中，迪安曾经一再侮辱中立国，把中立国家称做是“政治游戏”中的“小卒”。迪安今天所提出的所谓十一项“谅解”，对中立国的侮辱已达到了登峰造极的地步。迪安把中立国家称为“没有投票权的观察员”。照迪安的意见，这些中立国家“应仅有权在会议上就双方同意的议程项目，在双方一致同意的时间、地点、会议和委员会上和双方一致同意的方式下发言，并且只能就双方预定在会议中讨论的问题发言”，他们也没有在上述“规定的范围以外参加政治会议的权利”。很明显，迪安是要使这些中立国家成为装饰政治会议的不开口的木偶。只要美方在所有各项议程上都不同意让他们发言，他们就根本不能出席会议。即使他们得到机会出席发言，也要受到各种各样的限制，甚至他们的发言方式也要按照规定的格式。这简直是拿中立国开玩笑，这就是迪安口口声声说的对于中立国的所谓“尊重”。迪安企图用这些侮辱性的限制完全取消中立国在政治会议中所起的协调的作用，来达到实质上不许中立国参加的目的。从迪安所提出的这样那样的限制中，可以清楚地看出，美方反对中立国参加政治会议的唯一原因，就是唯恐中立国遣返委员会在会议上协调双方的意见，使美国不能畅所欲为地进行破坏。
    迪安的十一项所谓“谅解”中还暴露了美方的对于政治会议的阴谋。他同意朝中方面的建议：政治会议的一切决议应在双方一致同意下作出，他说，
  “参加政治会议的每个政府应当只受它所参加的协议的约束”，可是他又主张“每一方作为一个单位进行投票”。迪安这种自相矛盾的主张说明了什么呢？这就是说，在政治会议上，美国将代表美方的十六个国家和李承晚集团垄断投票，但这十六个国家和李承晚集团中的任何一个又都可以不参加经过投票所作出的协议。这样，票是投过了，协议达成了，可是遵守与否，仍然是悉听尊便。这显然是企图为李承晚拒绝朝鲜问题的和平解决准备条件。
    迪安的这十一项所谓“谅解”中关于中立国问题的意见和朝中方面的意见完全背道而驰，可是迪安却公然撒谎说，这十一项“谅解”“综述了你方的许多答复和声明，在这些答复和声明中，有些双方已取得协议，有些大概可以达成协议，如果另外一些问题能够满意地澄清的话”，并且要求朝中方面予以证实。迪安企图用这种谎言来蒙蔽世界舆论，推卸美方拖延会谈的责任。但是迪安这种谎话是找不到市场的。朝中方面已经当场指出了迪安在中立国问题上的主张的荒谬。迪安对于全世界关心的朝鲜政治会议问题采取如此儿戏的态度，并且蓄意诽谤世界和平的堡垒苏联和侮辱中立国，这只能使全世界更加看清楚了蓄意拖延政治会议召开的就是美方。
