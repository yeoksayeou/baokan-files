    Shandong Province Emphasizes Leading Disaster Victims in Winter Production

    Party and government leading organs in some disaster-stricken areas of Shandong Province attach importance to leading disaster victims in winter production, and the policy of focusing on production for disaster relief in disaster areas has been basically implemented. At present, the special districts of Liaocheng, Heze, Linyi, and Huimin have all held county magistrate meetings to study and deploy winter production work in disaster areas. Counties such as Ye County, Jinxiang, Shouzhang, Tangyi, and Juye have formulated work plans to support disaster victims in production. Most disaster-stricken counties have held meetings of cadres in disaster areas, party representative meetings in disaster areas, and representative meetings of disaster victims to specifically study the issue of disaster victim production. Various regions have now begun to take action and have achieved considerable results. For example, disaster victims in Shouzhang, Liangshan, and Jiyang participating in transportation and handicraft production have daily incomes ranging from 4,000 to 7,000 yuan, with some reaching around 10,000 yuan. Economic departments in various regions also attach great importance to supporting production in disaster areas. The Yena County United Cooperative went deep into disaster villages to organize disaster victims to weave straw baskets. In one and a half months, they purchased more than 74,000 baskets, spending over 330 million yuan, with disaster victims gaining a net profit of more than 57 million yuan. Economic departments in Qihé and Yucheng counties helped farmers sell local agricultural by-products worth a total of 1.63 billion yuan. Some regions have also launched free lending. For example, Chezhuang in Juancheng County, in order to solve the financial difficulties of disaster victims in production, organized credit cooperatives, accumulating one stone and eight dou of grain and 500,000 yuan to help six households with difficulties in carrying out sideline production.

    While leading farmers in production, various regions have also paid attention to saving and surviving the famine. After publicity and education, the vast majority of people in disaster areas can live frugally and save for famine relief. In Bujiagang Township of De County, 214 households have collected more than 2,500 jin of wild vegetables, and another 220 households have started collecting, planning to collect and dry more than 4,000 jin of dried vegetables. Zhangjiazhai Village in Laixi County, through careful accounting, increased the planting of turnips by more than 70 mu, buckwheat by 23 mu, cabbage by more than 20 mu, and alfalfa by 11 mu, and plans to collect all sweet potato leaves and taro leaves for storage to prepare for famine. In Yinan County, 93 percent of disaster victims have collected drought-resistant dried vegetables, with an average of 40 jin per person.

    However, there are still some places where not enough attention is paid to production in disaster areas, action is slow, or there is a lack of specific measures. As a result, some disaster victims lack confidence in overcoming the disaster and have a simple mentality of relying solely on government relief. In addition, there is also blindness in sideline production in some areas, resulting in poor sales, and some have failed to integrate well with agricultural production, which has affected agricultural production. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems and further promote winter production and disaster relief work, the Shandong Provincial People's Government is preparing to hold a production and disaster relief work conference. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and related departments have jointly formulated specific plans for production and disaster relief, and are preparing to discuss and decide on them before implementation. In addition, as the weather is getting colder, the province has allocated 48 billion yuan in relief funds to various regions, focusing on solving the difficulties of disaster victims in repairing houses, food rations, and winter clothing.

    山东省重视领导灾民进行冬季生产
    山东省部分受灾地区党政领导机关重视领导灾民进行冬季生产，有灾地区以生产救灾为中心的方针基本上得到了贯彻。目前，聊城、菏泽、临沂、惠民等专区都已召开了县长会议，研究和布置了灾区冬季生产工作。掖县、金乡、寿张、堂邑、钜野等县已制定了支持灾民进行生产的工作计划，大部受灾县都召开了灾区干部会、灾区党代表会、灾民代表会等，具体研究灾民生产问题。现各地已开始行动并获得不少成绩。如寿张、梁山、济阳等地参加运输和手工业生产的灾民，每天都有四千到七千元的收入，有的达到万元左右。各地经济工作部门对支持灾区生产也很重视，掖南县联合社深入灾村，组织灾民编织草提篮，一个半月中收购了七万四千多个，支出三亿三千多万元，灾民获纯利五千七百多万元。齐河、禹城两县经济工作部门，帮助农民推销土副产品总值达十六亿三千万元。有的地区还开展了自由借贷，如鄄城县车庄为了解决灾民生产中的资金困难，组织了信用合作社，积粮一石八斗，款五十万元，帮助六户困难户进行副业生产。
    各地在领导农民进行生产的同时，也注意了节约渡荒工作。经过宣传教育后，灾区广大群众都能省吃俭用，节约备荒。德县卜家乡已有二百十四户采集野菜二千五百多斤，另有二百二十多户开始采集，计划采晒干菜四千余斤。莱西县张家寨村通过算细账，全村增种萝卜七十余亩，荞麦二十三亩，白菜二十余亩，苜蓿十一亩，并计划把地瓜叶、芋头叶全部收集起来，贮存备荒。沂南县已有百分之九十三的灾民采集了渡荒干菜，平均每人有四十斤。
    但也还有些地方对灾区生产重视不够，行动迟缓，或缺乏具体办法，因而有的灾民战胜灾荒信心还不足，存在单纯依赖政府救济思想。另在副业生产上，有的地区还有盲目性，以致销路不畅，有的未能很好地和农业生产结合进行，以致使农业生产受到影响。为了解决上述存在的问题，进一步推动冬季生产救灾工作，山东省人民政府准备召开生产救灾工作会议，省民政厅并和有关部门共同拟定了生产救灾的具体方案，准备讨论决定后加以贯彻。另因天气日渐寒冷，该省已将四百八十亿元救济款分拨各地，有重点地解决灾民修补房屋、口粮和冬衣等困难。（林准）
