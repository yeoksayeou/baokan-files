Meticulous Care

Anshan Iron and Steel Company Mechanical Installation Engineering Company, Seamless Steel Tube Plant Installation Technician Zhang Qiufan

The Seamless Steel Tube Plant is about to start production. Under the guidance of Soviet experts – our teachers – we, the mechanical installation workers and technicians, have installed thousands of tons of precision, complex, and fully automated machinery, and have learned how to install these machines properly.

Before the installation of the machinery, our Soviet experts, Anicheev and Klibachov, came to the construction site to guide us on how to start the work. The experts put forward many suggestions on the overall aspects, such as establishing training classes and technical groups, creating advanced construction drawings and construction methods, pre-assembly, dividing work sections, preparing tools and materials, organizing drawings and data, determining transportation routes, equipment layout and storage, as well as preparing surveying personnel and instruments... These many measures are actually a battlefront deployment. From the Soviet experts, we learned how to consider all aspects of the entire project before the installation begins.

During the installation process, the experts taught us many advanced working methods, such as the ball clearance adjustment method, the pinion clearance adjustment method, the thermal loading and unloading ball method, the fixed frame installation foundation bolt method, deformation processing... Due to the experts' frequent and cordial guidance, these working methods have been mastered by all our staff. For example, using the measurement instrument installation method, the error in machine installation has been reduced from 3.2 millimeters in the past to a few hundredths of a millimeter.

The Soviet experts' concern for our construction is even more meticulous. I remember one day in mid-June last year, it was pouring rain at noon, and I was working in the third work section. That work was temporary, the roof of the shed was broken and had not been repaired. Rain poured from the roof into the factory building. We covered the machinery being cleaned with mats and tarpaulins, but they were not covered well, and some rainwater still leaked onto the machines. It was almost time to get off work for lunch when expert Klibachov arrived at the scene. He immediately said to us: "These machines are the property of the Chinese people, and we must not allow them to be exposed to any moisture." He pointed out that the tarpaulins and mats should not be placed flat on the machinery, but should be built into a tent-like shape, wider at the base and narrower at the top, so that the rainwater would flow to both sides instead of entering the machinery. So we re-covered the machines. As for the expert's pragmatic working methods, they constantly educated us in practical work. At the beginning of the machine installation, we did not know how to do it, so the expert personally installed it for us to see, and then let us carry out the installation. We young technicians must learn from the Soviet experts' internationalist spirit and pragmatic working methods.

    无微不至的关怀
    鞍山钢铁公司机械安装工程公司  无缝钢管厂安装技术员  张秋帆
    无缝钢管厂将要生产了，我们安装机械的工人和技术人员，在苏联专家——我们的老师的指导下，安装好了几千吨精密、复杂、全部自动化的机械，并且学会了怎么样才能安装好这些机械。
    在安装机械以前，我们的苏联专家安尼切耶夫和克里巴乔夫就来到了工地，指导我们怎样着手工作。专家从总的方面提出了许多建议，例如成立训练班和技术组，制作先进的施工图施工法，进行预装配，划分工段，准备工具材料，整理图纸资料、确定运输线路，设备的布置和保管，以及测量人员和仪器的准备……这许多措施，也就是一个战斗前的部署。从苏联专家那里，我们学习了在安装开始以前，应该怎样从各方面来考虑整个工程中的各项问题。
    在安装过程中，专家教会了我们许多的先进的工作方法，如滚珠间隙调整法、牙轮间隙调整法、热装卸滚珠方法、固定架安装基础螺丝法、变形处理……由于专家经常的亲切的指导，这些工作方法已经为我们所有的工作人员所掌握。例如：利用测量仪器安装法，安装机器的误差从过去三点二公厘，降低到百分之几公厘。
    苏联专家对我们建设的关心更是无微不至。我记得在去年六月中，有一天中午正下着倾盆大雨，我正在第三工段工作。那个工作是临时性的，工棚房顶坏了，还没有修好。雨从屋顶上哗哗地灌到厂房里来。我们用席子和帆布盖在正在清洗的机械上，可是盖得不好，还有一些雨水漏到机器上。当时就要下班吃饭了，克里巴乔夫专家赶到了现场。他马上和我们说：“这些机械都是中国人民的财产，我们一定不能让它受到一点潮湿。”他指出盖着的帆布和席子，不应该平放在机械上面，而应搭成一个上尖下大像篷帐似的，这样才能使雨水往二旁淌，而不进入机械内。于是我们又重新把机械盖好。至于专家的实事求是的工作方法，更是每时每刻地在实际工作中教育着我们。在安装机械开始时，我们不会，专家就亲自安装给我们看，然后再让我们进行安装。我们年青的技术人员，一定要好好地学习苏联专家这种国际主义精神，和实事求是的工作方法。
