Guiding the Enthusiasm of the Masses onto the Correct Path of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
——A Review of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Coal Mining Industry System
Liu Bang

From many readers' letters, it can be seen that the movement to increase production and practice economy has been widely carried out in the national coal mining industry system. With the exception of individual mines and some departments, the broad masses of workers have been mobilized. Their labor enthusiasm is very full and continues to rise. Most of the bureaus and mines in North China have successively launched friendly competitions between mines, tunneling teams, and coal face teams. Many units have completed or overfulfilled the glorious tasks assigned to them by the state based on the development of labor competitions. The entire North China region completed 111.48% of the state plan in September. The combined mining machine of the No. 2 Mine of Datong Mining Bureau created a new national record of 13,254 tons per month. Hegang Mining Bureau completed the annual tunneling task two months and ten days ahead of schedule. Ma Liuhaizi and Lian Wanlu fast tunneling team of Datong Mining Bureau created a new national record of 766.70 meters of tunneling in October. Fushun Mining Bureau produced more than 600 rationalization proposals in September and October. Kailuan Coal Mine also reversed the situation of failing to complete the task and completed 109.48% of the state plan in October. This is good and also the main aspect.

However, while completing the state plan, two completely different situations have emerged, which are worthy of attention: One situation is that increase production and practice economy are combined with improved enterprise management in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee. When launching and organizing production increase competitions, instead of disrupting the original work deployment, the original work deployment is further strengthened, especially by focusing on the key issues of the enterprise to increase labor productivity, thereby achieving the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy. Unfortunately, there are still not many such units now.

Another more common situation is that the basis for completing the plan in some units is not solid. A part of the mines are increasing production by simply adopting the method of overtime and rush work under the conditions of lagging tunneling work, unsound planning management, and setting aside the policy of safe production and improving quality.

Kailuan Coal Mine had very low output in the first half of September, and the output suddenly increased in the second half of the month, especially in the last five days. This is naturally inseparable from the active response of all employees to the call of the Party and the government and the display of initiative and creativity in their work; however, on the other hand, it is because the mines under the mine (except for Zhao Gezhuang Mine) simply used overtime and rush work by borrowing days off to complete the task. For example, Tangjiazhuang Mine borrowed 2,545 workdays off and worked 7,095 hours of overtime, producing 2,012 tons of coal in the night shift. Tangshan Mine borrowed 949 workdays off and worked 13,400 hours of overtime, producing 1,254 tons of coal in the night shift. Some grassroots cadres in the vertical shaft of Xi'an Mining Bureau even put forward the slogan "If you don't complete the shift task, you won't be allowed to ascend the shaft to see the sun" when arranging tasks, so that the No. 1 Zhangzi Wang Chengwen class "created" an "unprecedented record" of working continuously for 15 hours. Some grassroots cadres of Fushun Mining Bureau held mobilization meetings at the end of the month, one-sidedly publicizing that "the state plan is the law," saying: "If we don't complete the task, we will go to jail, and you will not look good either." In fact, they forced the workers to work hard to rush the task and complete the task. Even more peculiar is that Wangjiayuan Mine of Pingxiang Mining Bureau formed a coal mining team with the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres on the ground to go down the well to rush production. The chairman of the labor union personally pushed the cart, and the secretary of the Party branch also supervised in the well overnight, putting aside all other business.

Rush production inevitably violates technical safety regulations and endangers safety. Many situations in this regard have now been discovered and urgently need to be stopped. In some working faces of Beipiao Mining Bureau, there are no safety exits, and the mining procedures seriously violate the regulations. For example: Instead of following the trend in the large palm, it is opened from the middle to both sides; some are mined in places with three old ponds; some are single-hole tunneling, and air is pumped from the old pond (with gas) to the tunneling face; some reduce the blasting wire to 10 meters to 20 meters (should be 40 meters) in order to "save"; according to regulations, workers can only enter the roadway one quarter of an hour after blasting. In order to catch up with the task, workers rush to the palm face as soon as the cannon sounds; when the open-pit coal mining section of Fushun Mining Bureau collapses rocks and blasts, the squad leader takes the lead in not leaving the warning line, trying to get away with it.

The result of rushing production and violating regulations is a decline in coal quality and an increase in accidents. The ash content of coal produced by Kailuan Coal Mine in September exceeded the state regulations by 1.9%; in order to rush production and produce more coal, gangue was also transported out as raw coal, and more than 10,000 tons of gangue were produced in the same month. Among the nine cars of raw coal issued by Fushun Mining Bureau to China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in Shenyang and Fushun, there were more than 15 tons of stones, the largest of which weighed 500 to 600 pounds.

The situation of a surge in accidents is serious. For example, 22 cases of work-related injuries and mechanical and electrical accidents occurred in Jingxing Mining Bureau in September. Since the competition in Jiawang Mining Bureau, work-related accidents have been rising month by month. Three major casualty accidents occurred in Datong Mining Bureau in the first half of October. The drilling company of the mine lacks technical personnel. More than 40 temporary workers who have never seen drilling rigs and do not understand technology operate three drilling rigs. The director of the mining bureau does not actively try to solve these problems, but just calls out: "Start drilling, if you don't start drilling, you won't be able to complete the task!" As a result, the accident of Zhang Yongquan being strangled by a porcelain plate occurred. In September, mechanical and electrical failures in Fengfeng Mining Bureau exceeded the highest record in the past nine months, and accidents caused by violations of operating procedures and labor discipline accounted for more than 70%. It is not difficult to see how seriously accidents are threatening production! It is also not difficult to imagine how many crises are lurking behind the over-fulfillment of production figures! If effective measures are not taken to reverse these deviations and consolidate the current production results, the competition will definitely not be sustainable, and the movement will inevitably not develop healthily and steadily.

The above facts show that: on the one hand, the movement to increase production and practice economy is widely carried out, most of the masses are mobilized, and labor enthusiasm and production initiative are unprecedentedly high. On the other hand, some units lack correct leadership in the movement and fail to guide the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses onto the correct track of increasing production and practicing economy in a timely manner.

The central link in leading the movement to increase production and practice economy is to give play to the initiative and creativity of the workers and masses to improve and improve the management level of enterprises. At the present stage, in the coal mining industry, specifically, it is to do a good job in planning management, further implement safe production, strengthen the leadership and inspection of tunneling work, improve quality, and comprehensively achieve the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy. It is, of course, very important that the masses are mobilized and have great enthusiasm for work, but this is only the beginning. What follows is even more important: timely, in-depth, and lasting correct leadership. Judging from the current situation of the increase production and practice economy competition in the coal mining industry system, strengthening inspection and specific leadership, promoting advanced experience, launching employees to put forward rationalization proposals around key issues, launching technical personnel and veteran workers to combine labor and technology, launching office personnel, fixing labor organizations, improving the utilization rate of machinery, etc., in a word: combining the enthusiasm of the masses with scientific management is the key to steadily advancing the increase production and practice economy movement at present.

    把群众的热情引向增产节约的正确道路
    ——评煤矿工业系统的增产节约运动
    柳梆
    从许多读者来信中，可以看到，增产节约运动在全国煤矿工业系统中已经普遍开展起来。除个别矿井和若干科室部门外，广大职工群众都已行动起来。他们的劳动热情十分饱满，而且还在不断地高涨。华北地区的大部分局矿已先后掀起了矿与矿、掘进组与掘进组、回采工作面与回采工作面之间的友谊竞赛。许多单位在开展劳动竞赛的基础上完成或超额完成了国家交给他们的光荣任务。全华北区九月份完成国家计划百分之一百一十一点四八。大同矿务局二矿康拜因机创造月产一万三千二百五十四吨的全国新纪录。鹤岗矿务局提前两个月零十一天完成全年掘进任务。大同矿务局马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组十月份创造掘进七百六十六公尺七十公分的全国新纪录。抚顺矿务局九、十两个月涌现了六百余件合理化建议。开滦煤矿也扭转了完不成任务的局面，十月份完成国家计划百分之一百零九点四八。这是好的而且也是主要的方面。
    但是，在完成国家计划的同时，却出现了两种迥然不同的、值得注意的情况：一种情况是，按照党中央所指示的，把增产节约和改善企业管理相结合。在发动和组织增产竞赛的时候，不是打乱原来的工作部署，而是进一步加强原来的工作部署，特别是紧紧地抓住本企业的关键问题入手，来提高劳动生产率，从而达到增产节约的目的。可惜这样的单位现在还不多。
    另一种比较普遍的情况是：有些单位完成计划的基础是不牢靠的。有一部分矿是在掘进工作落后，计划管理不健全和把安全生产与提高质量的方针撇在一边的情况下，单纯采取加班加点的突击方法提高生产的。
    开滦煤矿九月份上半月产量很低，到下半月，特别是最末五天产量才突然提高。这自然是和全体职工积极响应党和政府的号召，在工作中发挥了积极性和创造性分不开的；但另一方面是该矿所属各矿（除赵各庄矿外）简单地用加班加点、借用轮休日突击生产的方法来完成任务的。例如唐家庄矿借用轮休日二千五百四十五个工，加班加点七千零九十五小时，夜班出煤二千零一十二吨。唐山矿借用九百四十九个轮休工，加班加点一万三千四百小时，夜班出煤一千二百五十四吨。西安矿务局竖井某些基层干部，在布置任务时居然提出：“完不成当班任务，不让升井见太阳”的口号，以致该井一号掌子王成文班“创造”了连续工作十五个小时的“空前纪录”。抚顺矿务局某些基层干部到月底就开动员大会，片面宣传“国家计划就是法律”，说：“完不成任务我们坐监牢，你们也不好看。”实际上是逼迫工人加劲突击，完成任务。更奇特的是萍乡矿务局王家源矿把地面上党、政、工、团的干部都组成采煤大队，下井突击生产。工会主席亲自推车，党总支书记也连夜在井下监督，把其他的业务都搁置不管。
    突击生产不可避免地就要违反技术保安规程和危及安全。这方面现在已经发现许多亟待制止的情况。北票矿务局所属各矿有些工作面没有安全出口，开采程序严重违反规程。例如：在大掌子中不顺走向，而是由中间往两边开；有的在三面老塘的地方开采；有的单孔掘进，从老塘（有瓦斯）抽风往掘进面送；有的为了“节约”，把炮线减缩为十公尺到二十公尺（应为四十公尺）；按规定放炮后一刻钟工人才可以进入巷道，为了赶任务，现在炮一响，工人就一个劲往掌子面跑；抚顺矿务局露天矿采煤段崩岩放炮时，班长带头不出警界线，企图侥幸躲过去。
    突击生产和违反规程的结果，便是煤质下降和事故增多。开滦煤矿九月份产煤灰分超过国家规定百分之一点九；为了突击生产多出煤，矸石也被当作原煤运出来，同月份多出了一万余吨矸石。抚顺矿务局发给中国煤业建筑器材公司沈阳、抚顺市公司的九车原煤中，有石头十五吨以上，其中最大的有达五、六百斤的。
    事故激增的情况是严重的。如井陉矿务局九月份发生工伤和机电事故达二十二次。贾汪矿务局竞赛以来，工伤事故逐月上升。大同矿务局十月份上半月发生重大伤亡事故三件。该矿钻探公司技术人员不够，三部钻机就有四十多个从未见过钻机、不懂技术的临时工在操作，矿务局长不积极设法解决这些问题，只是叫：“开钻，不开钻完不成任务！”结果发生张永权被瓷盘绞死的事故。峰峰矿务局九月份机电故障超过了九个月以来的最高纪录，因为违反操作规程和劳动纪律而引起的事故占百分之七十以上。不难看出：事故已是怎样严重地在威胁着生产！也不难想见：在超额完成生产数字的背后，同时潜伏着多少危机！如果不采取有效措施扭转这些偏差，巩固当前的生产成绩，竞赛一定不能持久，运动必然不能健康而稳步地向前发展。
    上述事实说明：一方面是增产节约运动普遍开展，大部分群众发动起来，劳动热情和生产积极性空前昂扬。另一方面是有一些单位对运动缺少正确的领导，未能及时把群众的积极性和热情引向增产节约的正确轨道。
    领导增产节约运动的中心环节就是发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，来改进和提高企业的管理水平。在现阶段的煤矿工业具体地说就是搞好计划管理，进一步贯彻安全生产，加强掘进工作的领导和检查提高质量，从而全面地达到增产节约的目的。群众发动起来，干的劲头很大，这自然是十分重要的，但这只是事情的开端，而紧接着的也是更重要的是及时深入而持久的正确领导。从煤矿工业系统目前的增产节约竞赛的情况看来，加强检查与具体领导，推广先进经验，围绕关键问题发动职工提合理化建议，发动技术人员和老工人做到劳动和技术相结合，发动科室人员，固定劳动组织，提高机械利用率等，一句话：把群众的热情与科学管理结合起来，是当前把增产节约运动稳步地推向前进的关键。
