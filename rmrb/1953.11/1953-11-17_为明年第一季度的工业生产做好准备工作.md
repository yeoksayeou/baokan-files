To prepare for industrial production in the first quarter of next year

Currently, the most important task for all industrial enterprises in production is to continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, to overfulfill the state plan and the plan to increase production and practice thrift. In this regard, we have achieved significant results. As long as we conscientiously follow the instructions of the Central Committee, continue to work hard, rely on the broad masses of workers and staff, and improve the management of enterprises, we have full confidence in realizing the call of the Central Committee and completing the state plan. We wish the first year of the first five-year plan a victory in industrial production.

Since large industrial production is different from agricultural seasonal production and handicraft production, it has the characteristic of continuous production. This characteristic of large industrial production constantly requires that preparations be made for the next production cycle in the current production cycle. This means that from now on, we should pay attention to making various preparations for next year's production, especially for the first quarter of next year. However, according to recent inspections by some industrial departments, some industrial and mining enterprises have neglected this aspect of work in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. Some, in order to increase production, do not carry out timely repairs of production equipment that should be repaired, but continue to operate them, even accelerate their operation; some neglect the reserve of raw materials, use the raw materials that should be reserved, and do not actively find ways to solve the source of raw materials; others do not pay attention to preparing work-in-progress and semi-finished products for the next step of production, and so on. If this phenomenon is not quickly corrected, these enterprises are very likely to complete this year's plan, but seriously affect the production in the first quarter of next year, and may even cause the interruption of production. That would disrupt the production deployment, put the leadership work of the enterprise in a passive position, and cause great waste to the country. At the same time, according to past experience, many industrial and mining enterprises are often slack at the beginning and tight at the end of the production process, and the production plan for the first quarter is always not well completed, so they have to make up for it by working overtime in the subsequent quarters, which causes an unbalanced phenomenon in production. If we neglect the production preparation work for the first quarter of next year, then the past phenomenon of production imbalance will not only not be overcome, but may continue to occur or even become more serious.

Therefore, on the basis of completing and overfulfilling this year's production plan, conscientiously preparing for the production in the first quarter of next year is an indispensable task in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. The view and practice that separates the development of the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, and the preparation for next year's production—only paying attention to increasing production and not paying attention to preparing for next year's production, etc.—is obviously incorrect.

To prepare well for industrial production in the first quarter of next year, the following work must be carried out:

First, correctly compile the industrial production plan for the year 1954 and the first quarter. At present, various regions and departments are compiling the plan for 1954. It will take a considerable amount of time for this annual plan to be compiled from the grassroots units of enterprises to the upper-level approval, and then to be distributed to the grassroots factories and mines; in order not to delay the production in the first quarter of next year, all industrial and mining enterprises and their management departments should compile the plan for the first quarter of next year at the same time as compiling the annual production plan, and list it by month, so that each enterprise can carry out production in a timely manner according to this plan. This quarterly plan can be implemented after being approved by the leaders of the respective industrial departments. If modifications are needed after the annual plan is determined, appropriate adjustments can be made. In this way, the production of each factory and mine in the first quarter of next year can be carried out in a planned manner, and various preparations can be made as early as possible, to avoid the phenomenon of production disconnection that may occur in some grassroots production units due to waiting for the annual plan.

Second, all industrial enterprises are required to pay attention to strengthening the necessary preparatory work in the production process. The main ones are: all production equipment that should be repaired must be repaired according to the plan, and cannot be sloppily delayed, otherwise it will not only affect the efficiency and life of the production equipment, but also easily lead to major personal and equipment accidents in the future. Therefore, all industrial enterprises must do a good job in the maintenance and repair of equipment according to the requirements of the production plan for next year. At the same time, it is necessary to prepare the necessary number of work-in-progress and semi-finished products according to the requirements of the production plan, to prevent some enterprises from using up the work-in-progress and semi-finished products needed for the next production cycle due to rushing to complete tasks, resulting in the interruption of production in the next cycle. In the mining industry, it is necessary to do a good job in geological work and tunneling before mining, which is an important link to ensure the production of this sector. Last year, coal mines failed to complete the tunneling plan, which affected the completion of this year's production tasks. This lesson should be remembered. In addition, for enterprises that have new product trial production tasks this year, if the trial production has been successful and mass production can be transferred to next year, after appraisal and approval, they should actively make full preparations for the transfer to formal production, and make proper arrangements for the equipment, tools, and labor organization for the production of this product.

Third, each industrial enterprise and its leading department should immediately begin to study the combination of supply, production, and sales for next year to ensure the normal progress of production next year and avoid the phenomenon of work stoppage due to waiting for materials or product stagnation in the production process. For the products in the first quarter of next year, each enterprise must now find sales targets and sign agreements with the user departments, and organize production according to the requirements of the user departments, so that the products can be delivered immediately after they are manufactured. In this way, it can not only meet the needs of the user departments, but also avoid backlog. At the same time, each enterprise should formulate a raw material supply plan according to the requirements of production. Before compiling the raw material supply plan, it is necessary to first inventory the unit's inventory, and then submit an application to the relevant parties for the materials it lacks, to prevent the phenomenon of work stoppage due to waiting for materials or material backlog. All supply and sales work should be carried out through contractual relations, so that both parties strictly implement them to ensure the realization of the plan.

In order to cooperate with the production preparation work of various industrial production departments next year and reduce the difficulties of industrial enterprises in supply and sales, transportation and trade cooperation departments must also improve their work and strengthen planning according to the needs of the production departments.

Leading cadres of various industrial departments and their affiliated bureaus, as well as various enterprises, should, in the near future, combine the inspection of the implementation of this year's plan to conduct a serious study and deployment of the production preparation work for next year, in order to overfulfill the state's plan and prepare for next year's production, to welcome the second year of the first five-year plan!

### 为明年第一季度的工业生产做好准备工作

    为明年第一季度的工业生产做好准备工作
    各工业企业目前在生产方面最主要的任务，就是要在继续深入开展增产节约运动的基础上，超额完成国家计划和增产节约计划。在这一方面，我们已得到显著成绩，只要我们切实按照中央的指示，继续努力，依靠全体职工群众，改善企业的管理工作，我们是有充分的信心实现中央的号召和完成国家的计划的。我们预祝第一个五年计划的第一个年度在工业生产上的胜利。
    由于大工业生产不同于农业季节性的生产，也不同于手工业的生产，它具有连续生产的特点。大工业生产的这一特点，就时刻要求这一个生产周期中同时要为下一生产周期作好准备。这也就是说，从现在开始，我们就应该注意为明年的生产特别是为明年第一季度的生产进行各项准备工作。但根据最近某些工业部门的检查，若干工矿企业在增产节约运动中，忽视了这一方面的工作。有的为了增加生产，使应该及时检修的生产设备不进行检修，而继续运转，甚至加速运转；有的忽视原材料的储备，动用应该储备的原材料，又不积极想法解决原材料的来源；有的则不注意为下一步生产准备在制品和半成品等等。这种现象如果不迅速加以纠正，这些企业单位就有极大可能虽然完成了今年的计划，但却严重影响到明年第一季度的生产，甚至可能造成生产的中断。那就会打乱生产部署，使企业的领导工作陷于被动，并使国家造成极大的浪费。同时，根据以往经验看来，许多工矿企业在生产进行中，常是前松后紧，第一季度的生产计划总是完成得不好，只好在今后的季度中以加班突击来补足，这就造成生产上不均衡的现象。如果目前我们忽视明年第一季度的生产准备工作，那么，过去的那种生产不均衡的现象不仅不能克服，而且可能继续发生甚至更加严重。
    因此，在完成与超额完成今年生产计划的基础上，切实准备明年第一季度的生产，是增产节约运动中一项不可忽视的任务。那种将开展增产节约运动、超额完成今年生产计划与做好明年生产准备工作相割裂的看法和做法——只注意增产，不注意为明年生产作准备等等，显然是不正确的。
    做好明年第一季度工业生产的准备，就要进行以下工作：
    首先，正确编制一九五四年年度及第一季度的工业生产计划。目前各地区各部门正在进行一九五四年计划的编制工作，这个年度计划，从企业的基层单位编制到上级审批，而后再下达到基层厂矿，将需要一个相当的时间；为了不耽误明年第一季度的生产，各工矿企业及其管理部门在编制年度生产计划的同时，应编好明年第一季度的计划，并按月份列出，以便各个企业能及时按此计划进行生产。这种季度计划，经各该工业部门的领导上批准即可执行。如果年度计划确定之后需要作修改时，则可作适当调整。这样，就能使明年第一季度各厂矿的生产有计划地进行，并及早进行各项准备工作，避免某些基层生产单位因等待年度计划而可能发生的生产上的脱节现象。
    其次，要求各工业企业注意加强生产过程中所必须的准备工作，主要的有：凡是应该进行检修的生产设备，必须按计划进行检修，不能马虎拖延，否则不但影响到生产设备的效能和寿命，而且很容易招致尔后重大人身事故和设备事故的发生，因之，各工业企业必须根据明年生产计划的要求，做好设备的维护与检修工作。同时，必须按照生产计划的要求，准备好必要数量的在制品和半成品，防止某些企业因赶任务，把下一生产周期所需要的在制品、半成品用光，以致由此而造成下一周期生产的中断。在采掘工业部门中，必须做好采掘前的地质工作和掘进工作，这是保证这一部门生产的重要环节。去年煤矿由于没有完成掘进计划，以致影响到今年生产任务的完成，这一教训应该记取。此外，凡是今年有新产品试制任务的企业，如试制已经成功，明年可以转入成批生产者，在经过鉴定和批准之后，应积极为转入正式生产作充分的准备，对生产该项产品的设备、工具以及劳动组织等作妥善布置。
    再次，要求每个工业企业及其领导部门，应即着手研究明年供、产、销的结合问题，以保证明年生产的正常进行，避免生产过程中的停工待料或产品呆滞现象。各个企业对于明年第一季度的产品，现在就要找好销售对象，并与用货部门订立协议，按照用货部门的要求组织生产，以便产品一经制出即可立即交货。这样，既能满足用货部门的需要，又可避免积压。同时，各个企业应按生产的要求，订出原材料供应计划。在编制原材料供应计划之前，要求首先清理本单位的库存，然后把自己所缺的物资，向有关方面提出申请，以防止停工待料或材料积压的现象发生。所有供销工作，均应通过合同关系，使双方严格执行，以保证计划的实现。
    为了配合各工业生产部门的明年生产准备工作，使工业企业在供销方面减少困难，交通运输与贸易合作部门亦须根据生产部门的需要，改进自己的工作，加强计划性。
    各工业部门和所属各管理局，以及各企业的领导干部，都应在最近期间，结合检查今年计划执行的情况，对明年的生产准备工作进行一次认真的研究和布置，以超额完成国家的计划和做好明年生产的准备工作，来迎接第一个五年计划的第二个年度！
