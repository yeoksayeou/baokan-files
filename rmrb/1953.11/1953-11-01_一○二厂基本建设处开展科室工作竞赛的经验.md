    The Experience of the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office in Carrying Out Work Competitions Among Departments
    Li Yuan, Secretary of the CCP Chongqing No. 102 Factory Committee

    Since June of this year, the various departments of the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office have launched work competitions, and have achieved great results so far. In the past, none of the departments in the entire office had ever completed their plans on a monthly basis. After the competition, the completion rate reached 114.2% in July and 103% in August. In the past, there was a lot of waste in the projects. In July and August, not only was the quality of the projects guaranteed, and many shortcomings in the work were overcome, but also more than 200 million yuan was saved. The finance department, which has always been considered relatively backward, has made many improvements in its work during the competition, and was rated as a model department (Grade C) in August. In the past, it was always considered difficult to mobilize cadres at the section chief level and technical personnel to participate in the competition, but now they have all participated in the competition and become the leading backbone. Some have even been selected as models. In addition, advanced experiences have been promoted during the competition, such as the establishment of material requisition slips, which increased work efficiency threefold; the design department promoted the "double-person tracing method," and the supply department improved reimbursement procedures, both increasing work efficiency by more than one time. The building of the Party was also combined with the competition, and more than ten outstanding activists were honorably admitted into the Party.

    The basic experience of the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office in carrying out work competitions among departments is:

    1.  Whether or not the work competition in a department can be launched depends on whether the cadres at the section chief level can be mobilized to participate in and lead the competition. Some cadres at the section chief level in the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office have always believed that the competition is the business of the trade union and has nothing to do with them, and that participating in the competition will affect their work. This time, the leading comrades of the Capital Construction Office repeatedly explained that in order to complete the quality and progress plan of the project, the competition is not only the task of the trade union, but the common task of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. It was explained that competition is the most effective way to improve our department's work, and their opinions on the competition were solicited, and their correct opinions were respected and supported. After repeated persuasion and education, cadres at the section chief level gradually attached importance to the competition. When establishing the competition inspection and evaluation committee, section chiefs (some of whom are engineering and technical personnel) were absorbed into the leadership. During the re-election of the trade union, some section chiefs were also elected as trade union members, and some engineers were elected as trade union group leaders. In this way, the leadership of cadres at the section chief level over the competition was strengthened organizationally, which in turn motivated all cadres, brought into play everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and closely integrated the competition with the business work of each department. At the same time, the competition generally improved work efficiency and overfulfilled the plan on a monthly basis. Facts have also educated them, making them realize that doing a good job in the work competition of the department is an effective way to improve and enhance the management work of the department, complete the national plan, and also a good way to improve thinking and train cadres.

    2. According to the experience of the Capital Construction Office, the content of the work competition in each department should be based on the different tasks and characteristics of each department, put forward the key issues to be solved in different periods, and fully mobilize the masses to discuss and put forward rationalization proposals. In this competition, each department formulated monthly, weekly, and daily work instruction charts and work quotas according to the plan. The staff of each department formulated individual quotas and competition conditions according to the department's work plan. With the work quota, leaders and the masses are clear about the daily work, and it is also convenient to check the work, discover the advantages and disadvantages, praise the good, and criticize the bad. In this way, the competition becomes mass-based. Because the competition focuses on the plan, the process of competition is the process of mobilizing the masses to implement the operation plan and strengthen plan management; it is the process of gradually improving administrative management and improving work.

    3.  Another experience in carrying out the departmental work competition in the Capital Construction Office is to grasp the weak links and implement the responsibility system. In the past, the weakest unit in the entire office was the finance department. Due to the backwardness of the work of the department, seventy-eight project final accounts were accumulated and could not be reported, which seriously affected all capital construction work. The reason why the department became a weak link was that four of the thirteen cadres in the department, who were quite responsible, were at odds with each other and were irresponsible. In response to this situation, the leaders conducted education and assistance to these four comrades separately. For example, Comrade Yong Rengui of the department was irresponsible in his work, and his work quota was about to be dragged down in July. Comrade Chen Gengfu, a Party member, led the masses to actively help him under the leadership of the Party branch, which greatly moved him and made him actively participate in the competition. He has made great changes and improvements in his thinking and work style. By breaking through this weak link, the department completed all the seventy-eight project final accounts accumulated in the past in the competition, guaranteeing and promoting the progress of the work of the entire office.

    The weakest point in departmental work is that the phenomenon of unclear responsibility and no one being responsible is very serious. Therefore, the establishment and implementation of the responsibility system has become an urgent requirement of departmental work and one of the contents of the competition. In the course of the competition in the Capital Construction Office, with the development of the movement and the mass inspection and implementation of the responsibility system, the system was gradually revised by the masses according to the nature of the problem. After inspection in the competition, it was found that some of the past responsibility systems in the supply department were implemented well, some were implemented poorly, and some could not be implemented at all, and there were some systems that should have been but were not. According to this actual situation, after discussion by the masses and approval by the leadership, the ones that could not be implemented were reduced, and the ones that should have been were added, so that the responsibility system was formulated in line with reality, and everyone's sense of responsibility was also strengthened in the competition. The consolidation and gradual improvement of the responsibility system has also promoted the continuous consolidation and improvement of the competition.

    4.  The Capital Construction Office adopted the method of daily inspection, weekly evaluation and summary, and monthly summary and reward in this competition. The inspection method is a combination of top-down and bottom-up. The inspection results are announced on the blackboard newspaper or sent out in the form of a notice on a regular basis (some problems that do not need to be announced are sent out in the form of a notice to the person concerned), pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of the work and the points that should be paid attention to in the future, with great effect. (Blackboard newspapers, notices, and circulars are all very good forms and weapons of propaganda and mobilization work in departmental work competitions.) The content of the inspection is centered on the completion of the plan, involving other aspects of the problem. The experience of the Capital Construction Office proves that timely and serious inspection and evaluation, and not leaving the competition content, is of decisive significance for the consolidation and improvement of the competition.

    At the end of July, a monthly summary meeting of the work competition was held, summarizing the achievements, pointing out the shortcomings, announcing the results of the competition, and selecting model units, groups, and individuals, and distributing prizes. In July, two model departments, six model groups, and twenty-two model workers were selected. In August, efforts were made to consolidate the advanced, improve the intermediate, and help the backward. During the final evaluation in August, not only did most of the original model units maintain their honor, but also another model department and three model groups emerged. As the competition achieved great results, the entire office was rated as a model unit of the entire factory and awarded a red flag, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of all employees of the office and promoted the continuous progress of the movement.

    According to the experience of the departmental work competition in the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office, it can be summarized in the following sentences: The leader must lead, the key is the section chief; the competition focuses on the plan, the work focuses on the weak; establish the responsibility system, do a good job in inspection, evaluation, and reward.

    Of course, this is not to say that the work of the No. 102 Factory Capital Construction Office is all very good. In fact, changes in work systems and other aspects caused by the competition, and even problems such as focusing only on the quantity of work and relaxing the quality of work that arose in the competition, still need to be paid attention to and vigorously improved.

    一○二厂基本建设处开展科室工作竞赛的经验
    中共重庆市一○二厂委员会书记　李原
    一○二厂基本建设处的各个科室，从今年六月起展开了工作竞赛，到现在已取得很大的成绩。全处各科室过去从来没有按月完成过计划，竞赛后，七月份完成计划百分之一百十四点二，八月份完成计划百分之一百零三。过去工程浪费很大，七、八月份不仅保证了工程质量，克服了工作中的许多缺点，而且还节约了两亿多元。历来被认为较落后的财务科，竞赛中工作有很多改进，八月份被评为丙等模范科。过去一贯认为很难发动参加竞赛的科长级干部和技术人员都参加了竞赛，成为竞赛的领导骨干，有的还被选为模范。此外，在竞赛中推广了先进经验，如建立领发料手摺，提高工作效率三倍；设计科推广“双人描图法”，供应科改进报销手续，均提高工作效率一倍以上。在竞赛中还结合了建党工作，十多名优秀的积极分子光荣地被接收入党了。
    一○二厂基本建设处开展科室工作竞赛的基本经验是：
    一、科室工作的竞赛能否展开，关键在于科长
  一级的干部是否能被发动起来参加和领导竞赛。一○二厂基本建设处有些科长一级干部，一向认为竞赛是工会的事，与自己无关，认为参加竞赛会影响自己的工作。基本建设处的领导同志这次反复说明为了完成工程的质量和进度计划，竞赛不单是工会的任务，而是党、行政、工会、青年团共同的任务。说明竞赛是搞好我们科室工作最有效的工作方法，并征求他们对竞赛的意见，尊重并支持他们的正确意见，经过反复的说服教育，使科长一级干部对竞赛逐渐重视起来。在建立竞赛检查评判委员会时，吸收科长（有些科长是工程技术人员）参加领导。在改选工会时，也有的科长被选为工会委员，有的工程师被选为工会小组长。这样一来便从组织上加强了科长一级干部对竞赛的领导，从而也就带动了全体干部，发挥了大家的积极性和创造性，使竞赛和各科室的业务工作密切结合起来。同时，竞赛中普遍提高了工作效率，按月超额完成了计划。事实又教育了他们，使他们认识到作好科室的工作竞赛，就是改进和提高科室管理工作，完成国家计划的有效方法，也是提高思想，培养干部的好方法。
    二、根据基本建设处的经验，科室工作竞赛的内容，应根据各科室不同的任务和特点，提出不同时期要解决的关键问题，并充分地发动群众讨论，提出合理化建议。这次竞赛，各科室都根据计划，制订了按月、按周、按日的工作指示图表和工作定额，科室工作人员根据科室工作计划制订个人定额和竞赛条件。由于有了工作定额，领导和群众对每天的工作都心里有数，而且也便于检查工作，发现优缺点，好的表扬，坏的批评，这样一来竞赛就成为群众性的了。由于竞赛抓住了计划，所以竞赛的过程就是发动群众贯彻作业计划，加强计划管理的过程；就是逐步提高行政管理与改进工作的过程。
    三、基本建设处开展科室工作竞赛中的另一条经验，就是抓薄弱环节和贯彻责任制。过去全处最薄弱的单位是财务科。由于该科工作落后，使七十八个工程决算积压起来，报不出去，严重影响到全部基本建设工作。该科之所以成为薄弱环节，是由于全科十三个干部中有四个相当负责的干部闹不团结，不负责任。领导上针对这一情况，对这四个同志分别进行了教育和帮助。如该科雍仁贵同志工作不负责任，七月份他的工作定额眼看就要拖下来，党员陈耕夫同志在党支部的领导下带动群众积极地帮助他，使他大为感动而积极地参加了竞赛，他在思想上和工作作风上均有很大的改变和提高。由于突破了这个薄弱环节，该科在竞赛中将过去积压的七十八个工程决算全部完成，保证并推动了全处工作的进展。
    科室工作最薄弱的问题，就是责任不清和无人负责的现象很严重，因而建立和贯彻责任制就成为科室工作的迫切要求和竞赛的内容之一了。基本建设处在竞赛过程中，随着运动的开展和群众性的检查责任制的贯彻，根据问题的性质，通过群众逐步修订了制度。在竞赛中经过检查，发现供应科过去的责任制度有的执行得较好、有的执行得较差、有的根本不能执行，并且有一些制度应有而没有。按照这一实际情况，经群众讨论，领导批准，减掉了不能执行的，增加了应有的，使责任制订得切合实际，大家的责任感在竞赛中也加强了。由于责任制的巩固和逐步完善，也推动了竞赛的不断巩固和提高。
    四、基本建设处这次竞赛是采取了按日检查，按周评判小结，按月总结奖励的方法。检查的方式是从上而下和从下而上相结合，检查结果按期在黑板报上公布或发通知单（有些问题不需要公布就发通知单给本人），指出工作优缺点和今后应注意事项，效果很大。（黑板报、通知单、通报在科室工作竞赛中都是宣传鼓动工作的很好的形式和武器。）检查的内容是以完成计划情况为中心，涉及其他方面的问题。基本建设处的经验证明：及时而认真的检查评判，检查评判不要离开竞赛内容，对于竞赛的巩固与提高是有决定意义的。
    在七月底，召开了工作竞赛月终总结大会，总结了成绩，指出了缺点，宣布了竞赛的结果，选出了模范单位、小组及个人，发了奖品。七月份评选了两个模范科、六个模范组、二十二个模范工作者。八月份内大力巩固先进，提高中间，帮助落后，在八月终评选时不仅原来的模范单位大部保持了荣誉，而且又出现了一个模范科、三个模范组。由于竞赛取得了很大的成绩，全处被评为全厂的模范单位，并发给红旗，这样就更加鼓舞了该处全体员工的积极性，推动了运动继续前进。
    根据一○二厂基本建设处科室工作竞赛的经验，综合起来可用下面这几句话来说明，就是：首长要领导，关键是科长；竞赛抓计划，工作抓薄弱；建立责任制，做好查评奖。
    当然，这不是说一○二厂基本建设处的工作就都很好了，事实上，由于竞赛而引起的工作上制度上以及其他方面的变化，甚至在竞赛中产生的只求工作数量，放松了工作质量等问题，尚须加以注意和大力改进。
