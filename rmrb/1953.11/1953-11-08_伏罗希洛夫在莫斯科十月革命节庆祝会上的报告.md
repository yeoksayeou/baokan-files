Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS dispatch):

    Comrades!

    Today, the people of all nationalities in our motherland and the working people of the world are celebrating the thirty-sixth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    Thirty-six years ago, the working class of our country, in alliance with the poorest peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by the genius and immortal Lenin, broke through the imperialist front and firmly established the dictatorship of the proletariat, the power of workers and peasants, on one-sixth of the earth.

    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in 1917 marked a fundamental shift in human history.

    Each new anniversary of Great October demonstrates to the world the powerful creative force of the ever-victorious socialism, more vividly and profoundly year after year.

    Our Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party, established a socialist society for the first time in history, pointing out to the people of other countries the road to liberation from the oppression of exploiters, and the road to a free and happy life. Today, the great Chinese people, who have shattered the chains of feudal and imperialist oppression, the working people of the European and Asian People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic are advancing along this road with us.

    The heroic people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in their liberation struggle against the imperialist plunderers, have defended their freedom and independence, and are now restoring their war-torn economy with soaring labor enthusiasm.

    The Soviet people, filled with inexhaustible creativity, are greeting the thirty-sixth anniversary of the October Revolution with tremendous achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural development.

    Our achievements in peaceful construction are the pride of the Soviet people; the working people of other countries also regard these achievements as their pride, because they see the Soviet Union as a bastion of peace and national independence, and a great example in the struggle for a better future for mankind.

    Comrades!

    Many very important events have occurred in the year since the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

    The Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party was a historic stage in the life of the Party and the Soviet state. It was characterized by the unity of the Soviet people and their boundless trust in the long-tested Communist Party and its Central Committee. The resolutions of our Congress mobilized and inspired the Soviet people to create new achievements.

    The death of our great leader, the brilliant strategist Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, was a major loss for the Party, the peoples of the Soviet Union, and all progressive mankind in the past year.

    For thirty years after the death of U.I. Lenin, Joseph V. Stalin, who won the unanimous respect and boundless trust of the people and the Party, together with his loyal comrades-in-arms, steadfastly led the Party and the country along the Leninist road. In these years, our country has overcome unprecedented difficulties in the course of its struggle and has become a powerful socialist country. The creativity of our people – the true creators of history and builders of a new communist society – has been unleashed on an unprecedented scale.

    Our Communist Party is the successor to Lenin and Lenin's immortal cause, created and nurtured by the genius of the great Stalin. Its strength lies in the boundless love and loyalty of the masses. Under the leadership of its Central Committee, our Party is confidently leading our country to new victories in the struggle for communist construction.

    The Soviet Communist Party commemorated a historic day this year – the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Party. Our glorious Party has waged a half-century of heroic struggle to liberate the working people from the oppression of the Tsar and the landlord-capitalists, for the revolutionary transformation of society, and for the victory of communism. Because of this struggle, it has deservedly won the boundless love of the working people of our country and the broad masses of the world.

    Glory to our great Communist Party and its fighting headquarters – the Central Committee!

    Comrades!

    The vitality of the Communist Party's policy lies in the fact that this policy reflects the fundamental interests of the people and is based on a profound scientific understanding of the objective laws of social development. At all stages of communist construction, the Party's policy has always been guided by the basic economic law of socialism, which is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously increasing and perfecting socialist production on the basis of high technology.

    Armed with the resolutions of the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are victoriously fulfilling the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    The results of the development of our socialist industry in the first ten months of 1953 prove that the plan for the third year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan is being successfully implemented. The total industrial output in the first ten months of this year was 10.5 percent higher than in the same period last year, almost two and a half times the level of 1940.

    All sectors of the socialist national economy are developing on the basis of technological progress. The construction of the world's largest hydropower stations, the production of various efficient new powerful machine tools, equipment, and new agricultural machinery vividly demonstrate that the material and technical foundations of communism are being victoriously laid.

    Significant achievements have also been made in the development of science and socialist culture.

    Soviet scientists are constantly enriching science with new discoveries in all branches of knowledge. Our people deeply respect and are grateful to their scientists and cultural workers, and are justly proud of their tenacious and glorious labor for the benefit of the motherland.

    The literature and art of the Soviet people are developing. Soviet writers, actors, painters, and composers are working for the welfare of the people.

    Of course, we are not doing enough to meet the growing spiritual needs of the Soviet people. But, undoubtedly, workers in literature and film, artists and composers, and workers in other branches of art will make every effort to perfect their creations and create new works that brilliantly reflect the heroic lives and struggles of our people and the people of foreign countries.

    The victories achieved in the development of the socialist economy and science guarantee the further improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people. In the past twenty-eight years, the production of consumer goods in our country has increased twelvefold. In 1953, the production of consumer goods will increase by 72 percent compared to the pre-war level of 1940.

    This year, as in the past few years, the Party and the government have implemented the sixth consecutive reduction of state retail prices for manufactured goods and food, which has benefited residents 46 billion rubles in addition to other income. Moreover, if we include the reduction in prices in collective farm markets caused by the recent price reductions, the benefits received by residents in twelve months will be no less than 53 billion rubles.

    In the first ten months of 1953, retail sales to residents increased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year.

    Thanks to the measures taken by the Party and the government to further expand trade, the trade system has been able to obtain goods worth more than 37 billion rubles beyond the annual plan this year.

    The main task of the Communist Party and the Soviet government is to care for the welfare of the Soviet people. Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, emphasized in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that the Communist Party and the Soviet government consider their main task in domestic policy to be caring for the welfare of the people, and for the continuous improvement and improvement of the lives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, as well as the entire Soviet people.

    Recently, based on this, the Party and the government have adopted several very important resolutions, the implementation of which will ensure the rapid increase in the production of consumer goods, the further vigorous development of agriculture, the decisive improvement of Soviet trade, the significant increase in sales volume, the expansion of the scale of housing construction; in addition, many other measures have been taken.

    All these resolutions are permeated with the Party and government's deep concern for the people's welfare, and for greatly improving the living standards of the people in urban and rural areas in a short period of time.

    These resolutions are of historical significance because they mark a new stage in the development of the Soviet economy, that is, while we are rapidly developing heavy industry, we have also stipulated the task of rapidly developing the departments of the national economy that directly supply consumer goods. The policy of accelerating the development of agriculture, light industry, and the food industry is a further inevitable development of socialist industrialization, and fully conforms to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the entire socialist national economy.

    Comrades!

    The Party and the government are very concerned about the comprehensive consolidation and continuous development of our socialist agriculture. The Central Committee's September Plenum, which specifically discussed the further development of agriculture, discussed this issue from all angles and passed resolutions of historical significance. On the one hand, the Central Committee's Plenum pointed out the great victories achieved in the development of socialist agriculture, and at the same time pointed out with pure Bolshevik candor that the speed of agricultural development is lagging behind the speed of industrial development and the increase in residents' needs for daily necessities. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, emphasized in his comprehensive report at the Plenum that there is a clear imbalance between the rate of our large-scale industrial development, the increase in urban population, and the improvement of the welfare of the working masses, and the current level of agricultural production.

    The backwardness of important agricultural sectors such as livestock farming, potato, and vegetable production has delayed the further development of light industry and the food industry, and has greatly hindered the increase in the income of collective farms and collective farmers.

    The resolutions of the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the subsequent decisions of the Party and the government, stipulated broad measures aimed at further consolidating the collective farm system, developing livestock farming, expanding the production of vegetables and potatoes, increasing the harvest of grain, industrial crops, and oil-bearing crops, and improving the welfare of all collective farmers on this basis.

    At the same time, important measures have been planned to fundamentally improve the work of machine tractor stations. Machine tractor stations are the industrial, material, and technical foundation of the collective farm system. They must fully become the decisive organizational force in the development of collective farm production.

    In order to implement the stipulated measures and ensure the rapid development of socialist agriculture and animal husbandry, approximately 70 billion rubles will be allocated this year from the state budget, other state funds, and the collective farms' own funds for the development of agriculture. Agriculture will receive a total of 150,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 42,000 combines, and more than 2 million various agricultural machines and tools this year. This is a considerable help.

    But among the various forms of assistance given to our collective cultivation by the cities, the most important is assistance in terms of cadres. Cadres decide everything. Today, because the Party and the entire people demand that our agriculture rapidly improve to the level of socialist industry, improve to the level that can meet the constantly growing needs of the working people, and demand that the income of collective farms and every collective farmer greatly increase; the Party has called on all agricultural specialists and agricultural machinery operators to stand at the forefront of the struggle to increase the production of grain, meat, milk, and potatoes. This call from the Party has been warmly responded to, and a large number of agricultural specialists, engineers, and technicians have gone to work at machine tractor stations and collective farms.

    Party organizations, the Communist Youth League of Lenin, female members of collective farms, and party and non-party workers of machine tractor stations and state-owned farms must play a major role in carrying out the tasks stipulated by the Party and the government for agriculture. Only their labor enthusiasm and efficient work can guarantee that agriculture will be fully developed in a short period of time and increase its income.

    Comrades!

    The victorious completion of the major task of producing abundant consumer goods in our country depends directly on the further improvement of work in our industry. We must focus our attention on perfecting management, improving the efficiency of industrial departments, further increasing labor productivity, and improving quality and reducing production costs.

    Reducing production costs is a very important source of socialist accumulation. As everyone knows, in the past year alone, our country saved 46 billion rubles from reducing production costs. But if we work better, this is only a part of what we can save.

    However, there are still many factories that have not completed the task of increasing labor productivity stipulated by the state, there is still the phenomenon of defective products, and not enough effort has been made to actively strive to improve product quality and reduce production costs. The primary responsibility of industrial leaders, enterprise managers, engineers and technicians, workers, and all other working people, is to eliminate the shortcomings existing in current work, ensure the application and mastery of new technologies, improve the organization of labor, and greatly increase productivity under the conditions of continuous improvement in product quality.

    The task of Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations is to use various methods to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses, and more broadly launch a socialist competition to complete and overfulfill production plans, increase labor productivity, reduce production costs, and improve product quality.

    The creativity of the Soviet people is inexhaustible.

    The labor of our glorious, advanced workers is an example of the people's patriotic labor. These outstanding male and female workers, the sons and daughters of our great people, are an example for all Soviet workers. Their experience should be vigorously promoted and should become the basis of the labor of all working people.

    The wise Lenin and his successor, the great Stalin, repeatedly pointed out that the alliance between the working class and the peasantry is the strength and solid foundation of the Soviet system. They believed that the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the working peasants is the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The alliance between the working class and the peasantry under the leadership of the Communist Party is a decisive force that guaranteed our victory in October 1917 and the socialist construction of our country. The consolidation of this alliance is also a guarantee for our further advance towards communism. The measures taken by the Party and the government to develop agriculture and improve the people's living standards will further strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, and further strengthen the spiritual and political unity of all our people.

    Comrades!

    The multinational Soviet state has forever consolidated the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and the establishment of this country is the greatest achievement of the October Revolution. Our country has no ethnic conflicts at all. The October Revolution created conditions for the rapid economic and cultural development of all nationalities in our great motherland.

    We are on the eve of a great day – next January will be the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia. This festival is not only a great festival for the Russians and Ukrainians, but also a great festival for the people of all other nationalities in the Soviet Socialist Republics.

    The fraternal, unbreakable alliance and friendship of the Russian and Ukrainian people, as well as the people of all other nationalities in our great motherland, is the source of the invincible strength of the multinational Soviet state.

    Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship of the people of all nationalities in the great Soviet state!

    Further strengthening the Soviet state is one of the main conditions for the victorious construction of communism in our country. The Soviets, as a new and most democratic form of state administration, have been tested in the struggle for the happiness and freedom of the people. We must strengthen the Soviet state in every way, do our best to improve the work of the Soviets, and strengthen their ties with the broad masses.

    At the same time, we have a responsibility to strengthen the armed forces of the Soviet state in every way, who are defending the freedom and independence of our motherland and the peaceful construction labor of our peace-loving people.

    The Soviet people are full of energy and determination to strive for new achievements in communist construction and for the prosperity of the socialist motherland. The wise leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee and the Soviet government is the guarantee that our country will continue to advance steadily along the road of building a communist society.

    Comrades!

    The huge scale of peaceful construction work and the unprecedentedly large-scale and important measures taken by the Communist Party and the government to further develop the national economy and continue to improve the living standards of the Soviet people clearly demonstrate the peace-loving nature of the policies pursued by our Party and the Soviet government.

    The Soviet government, with its great strength and unity, has always pursued a policy of maintaining and strengthening world peace, developing good-neighborly relations with all countries, and developing and strengthening international economic ties.

    The general line of our foreign policy has always been and will never change.

    The imperialist camp, headed by the reactionary forces in the United States, is pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war. As everyone knows, due to the deliberate activities of the US aggressive group, the "Cold War" continues and is becoming increasingly tense. The unscrupulous and despicable slander campaign against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries has not stopped, but has intensified. The US government blatantly allocates hundreds of millions of dollars for sabotage activities in democratic camp countries, continues to pursue a policy of expanding armaments, patching up military blocs, and intensifying the establishment of dense networks of military bases in areas adjacent to the borders of democratic camp countries. All these facts cannot but cause deep anxiety to all peace-loving people.

    The signing of the Korean armistice agreement and the cessation of bloodshed in Korea is a huge contribution to easing international tensions. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union, together with the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, has tirelessly struggled to stop the cruel, unjust, and aggressive war imposed on the Korean people.

    Now that the aggressors' plans have failed in Korea, it is useful to mention some of the beneficial lessons of the Korean War again.

    The imperialist aggressors launched armed intervention in Korea, originally dreaming of enslaving the Korean people and, at the same time, drowning the national liberation movements of the countries in Asia and the Pacific region, which had already risen to fight for their independence and democratic freedom, in blood. But while the aggressors were still making their calculations, the people of all countries defending freedom and independence were already on full alert.

    The situation in Korea proves that the people of Asian countries are fully determined to defend their national freedom and independence and prevent the establishment of a new breeding ground for world war in the Far East.

    Imperialists should accept the truth that the era in which they could act arbitrarily and lord it over the people of enslaved colonies and dependencies has long passed. The historical destiny of the people of these countries has undergone a fundamental change. The people of Asian countries want to be the complete masters of their land and their destiny.

    In Asia, a great people's democratic country, the People's Republic of China, has been born, which is a stable factor for peace and progress in Asia and the world. This great country prevents imperialism from arbitrarily pursuing a policy of turning Asia into a source of a new world war. It is a powerful fortress for the oppressed people of the East in their struggle for freedom, democracy, and genuine independence.

    Speaking of this, one cannot fail to mention the position taken by imperialist countries against restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. This position undoubtedly contributes to the continued tension in the international situation. The great Chinese people cannot be ignored when solving the most important international issues, especially those related to the Far East. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, there can be no talk of easing international tensions and solving Asian problems.

    The Korean armistice laid a favorable foundation for easing international tensions. However, this is not to the taste of imperialist countries, because normalizing international relations is not part of their plan. This can be illustrated by the following fact: Western countries have remained silent on the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of representatives from the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to discuss general measures to ease international tensions. The position taken by the US ruling group on the issue of the Korean political conference also proves this point. This position cannot but cause concern to those who seek to resolve the Korean issue completely and as soon as possible and to peacefully resolve other outstanding issues in the Far East. US representatives are unwilling to have the political conference become a round table conference with the participation of not only the belligerent parties, but also relevant neutral countries. At the same time, it should be pointed out that a large Asian country like India has made no small contribution to ending the Korean War. However, the United States has ignored India and refused to invite India and some other neutral countries to participate in the Korean political conference. Obviously, imperialist aggressors have not abandoned their crazy plan to conquer the people of Asia by expanding aggression.

    The significance of resolving the German question for easing current international tensions cannot be overestimated.

    The Soviet Union, hoping that European peace would be guaranteed and consolidated, and that the national interests of the German people would be respected, has repeatedly proposed to Western countries suggestions for a just solution to the German question. The Soviet government believes that if a peace conference is convened to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of an all-German provisional government, all-German elections, and the reduction of Germany's financial and economic obligations due to the war, then the German question can and should be resolved in the interests of peace and taking into account the national aspirations of the German people.

    The attitude taken by Western countries towards the Soviet Union's suggestions cannot prove that they are willing to resolve the German question justly, nor can it prove that they are willing to consider – let alone respect – the national interests of the German people. In all their replies to the Soviet Union's suggestions, they have ignored all important aspects of the German question, such as issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of an all-German government, and the reduction of Germany's financial and economic obligations. They hypocritically put the so-called all-German election issue in the primary position, and it is difficult to understand how one can talk about holding all-German elections when Germany is divided into two parts; how one can talk about any elections when Germany does not have an all-German government.

    In addition, the consistent policy of Western countries towards Germany has exposed their true intentions, which is not to consolidate European peace, but to turn West Germany into a source of a new war in Europe. The US and British ruling groups openly pursue a policy of remilitarizing West Germany and accelerating the restoration of West Germany's armed forces. According to their plan, this armed force will become the backbone of the aggressive "European Army" they are putting together. Recently, since the elections of the Bonn Federal Parliament, the policy of reviving German militarism has become particularly blatant. West Germany's bellicose militarist groups have openly issued revanchist statements, attacking the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak People's Republic, and attacking the Soviet Union. They have issued threatening remarks to France, especially to the German Democratic Republic. These remarks are fully supported by the leading figures in the United States and Britain, who say that if France refuses to ratify the Paris Treaty on the establishment of the so-called "European Defense Community," then West Germany and its restored armed forces will directly join the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance, regardless of what France does.

    Western countries, which have to take into account the desire of the people of all countries for peace, occasionally say that they are willing to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on outstanding issues in order to ease tensions. But to judge how great the distance is between this statement and the policies implemented by Western countries, one can look at their attitude towards solving the German question. Western countries verbally agree to convene a meeting with the Soviet Union to discuss the German question. In action, they spare no effort to accelerate the ratification of the Paris and Bonn militarist treaties stipulating that West Germany join the aggressive Atlantic Alliance. Obviously, due to the ratification of such treaties, Germany cannot be reunited into a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country.

    Western countries, on the one hand, expressed their approval of discussing the German question with the Soviet Union, but at the same time, they concluded a separate agreement at the London Conference, which stipulated that West Germany participate in the aggressive Atlantic system pointed at the Soviet Union.

    Doesn't this position of Western countries make the four-country meeting's discussion of the German question empty in advance? Here, isn't it the attempt of Western countries to force the Soviet Union to accept their position on the German question, and once it fails, blame the Soviet Union for being "unwilling" to peacefully resolve the German question, thereby deceiving world opinion?

    Those who oppose a peaceful resolution of the German question should know that the peace-loving people of all countries are vigilantly watching all their conspiracies to prepare for war. The people of all countries are very clear that the not-so-sober Washington politicians, with the help and encouragement of some docile leaders in Britain and France, are reviving the breeding ground for aggression in West Germany, which is tantamount to playing with fire.

    Sober-minded German politicians cannot fail to recognize that the path that the Bonn revanchists are leading them down is fraught with fatal consequences for all of Germany.

    The policy of remilitarizing West Germany and dragging it into the aggressive Atlantic Alliance is inextricably linked to the policy of establishing military bases in some European countries bordering the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Undoubtedly, the above-mentioned situation is only a aspect of a policy of planning a war against the democratic camp countries. However, it is also necessary to draw appropriate conclusions from these aspects.

    Anyone who truly wants to ease international tensions cannot ignore the issue of abolishing the establishment of military bases on the territories of other countries. The Soviet Union has repeatedly raised this issue with Western countries in the past, and it still firmly raises this issue with them now. However, they have ignored it every time. The United States has recently intensified its pressure on Norway and Denmark, asking them to provide bases. It has also concluded agreements on military bases with Greece and Franco Spain, while doing everything possible to urge Iran and other Near East and Middle East countries to do the same.

    Western countries stubbornly resisted the decision to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the decision to reduce armaments by major powers. They claim that these issues are being discussed in the United Nations. However, everyone knows that the United Nations has been discussing these issues since its establishment, and there is no end to this fruitless discussion.

    Now, the people of all countries do not believe in words that cannot be translated into action. And the actions of the ruling groups of imperialist countries show that they are enemies of peace and those who implement a policy of inciting hatred among the people of all countries in order to facilitate preparations for a new war.

    The Soviet Union has consistently and persistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries. For example, the Soviet Union's policy of expanding economic ties with foreign countries is for this purpose. Our economic relations with people's democratic countries are developing and strengthening year by year. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also signed trade agreements with France, Italy, Argentina, Finland, Sweden, and many other countries this year. We attach great importance to strengthening international trade ties, because this helps to ease international tensions. We will continue to do our best to promote the expansion of trade between countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

    The powerful camp of democratic and socialist countries, firmly united by the ideas of proletarian internationalism, is confidently advancing along the road of further economic, political, and cultural upsurge. It is having an increasingly greater and more positive influence on the international situation, which is conducive to progress, peace, and democracy.

    The growing strength of the forces of peace has become a major factor in consolidating world peace. It is worth noting that the world congresses of women, youth, and trade unions convened this year were all conducted under the banner of hundreds of millions of people eagerly uniting to strive for peace, against the arms race, and against the attack of monopoly capitalists on the rights and freedoms of the working people. The strength of the working people, the strength of all those who hope to maintain peace and prevent war, lies in unity.

    Comrades! The Soviet system, established in our country thirty-six years ago due to the victory of the October Revolution, is exerting an ever-stronger influence on the course of world history year by year. The principles declared by the October Revolution have now become a huge force, uniting the powerful socialist democratic camp and inspiring hundreds of millions of working people to wage a selfless struggle for freedom and progress.

    Commemorating the thirty-sixth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    The tasks before us are arduous. To complete these tasks requires us to make greater efforts and the determination to overcome all the difficulties on our path. The Soviet people have never been afraid of any difficulties. We have full confidence that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, inspired by the ever-victorious Marxist-Engels-Lenin-Stalin doctrine, will surely move forward unswervingly and achieve new victories in the construction of communism.

    Long live the thirty-sixth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live international peace!

    Long live the great Soviet people!

    Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of the Communist Party, advance towards the victory of communism!

    (Prolonged, stormy applause and cheers in tribute to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party's Central Committee and the Soviet government resounded throughout the hall.)

    伏罗希洛夫在莫斯科十月革命节庆祝会上的报告
    同志们！
    今天，我们祖国的各族人民和全世界劳动人民，都在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年。
    三十六年以前，我国的工人阶级与最穷苦的农民结成联盟，在以人类的天才、不朽的列宁为首的共产党的领导下，突破了帝国主义阵线，在地球六分之一的土地上牢固地建立了无产阶级专政、工人和农民的政权。
    一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，标志着人类历史上的一个根本转变。
    伟大十月的每一个新的周年都向全世界显示了百战百胜的社会主义的强大的创造力，而且一年比一年鲜明，一年比一年深刻。
    我们苏维埃人民，在伟大的共产党领导下，破天荒第一次在历史上建立了社会主义社会，向其他国家人民指出了从剥削者的压迫下获得解放的道路，走向自由与幸福的生活的道路。今天，粉碎了封建与帝国主义压迫的锁链的伟大的中国人民，欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，和我们一起沿着这条道路前进。
    英雄的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民，在他们反对帝国主义掠夺者的解放斗争中维护住了他们的自由和独立，现在，他们正在以高涨的劳动热情恢复他们的遭受战争破坏的经济。
    苏联人民充满了用之不竭的创造力，正在以经济及文化发展各方面的巨大成就迎接十月革命三十六周年。
    我们在和平建设方面的成就是苏联人民的骄傲；其他国家的劳动人民也把这些成就当作是他们的骄傲，因为他们把苏联看作是和平与民族独立的堡垒，争取人类的美好未来的伟大榜样。
    同志们！
    在伟大的十月革命的三十五周年以后的这一年中，发生了许多非常重大的事件。
    共产党第十九次代表大会是党与苏维埃国家生活中的一个历史阶段。它的特色就是苏维埃人民的团结和他们对久经战斗锻炼的共产党及其中央委员会的无限信任。我们的代表大会的决议动员起了苏维埃人民并鼓舞他们创造新的业绩。
    我们的伟大领袖、天才战略家约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的逝世，是党、苏联各族人民以及全体进步人类在过去这一年中的重大损失。
    在乌·伊·列宁逝世以后的三十年中，获得了人民和党的一致尊崇和无限信任的约·维·斯大林，和他身边的忠实战友们一起，坚定不移地领导着党和国家沿着列宁主义的道路前进。在这些年中，我们的国家在战斗过程中克服了史无前例的困难，已经成了一个强大的社会主义国家。我们的人民——历史的真正创造者、新的共产主义社会的建设者——的创造力，已经以空前的规模发挥出来了。
    我们的共产党是列宁和列宁的不朽事业的继承者、伟大的斯大林的天才所缔造和培养出来的，它的强大，是由于群众的无限爱戴和忠诚。我们的党正在它的中央委员会的领导下，满怀信心地引导着我们国家在共产主义建设的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    苏联共产党今年纪念了一个历史性的日子——党成立五十周年。我们的光荣的党为使劳动人民从沙皇及地主—资本家的压迫下获得解放、为社会的革命改造、为共产主义的胜利进行了半个世纪的英勇斗争，由于这个斗争，它受之无愧地赢得了我们祖国劳动人民和全世界广大群众的无限爱戴。
    光荣归于我们伟大的共产党和它的战斗的参谋总部——中央委员会！
    同志们！
    共产党的政策的活力就在于这个反映了人民的根本利益的政策，是以对社会发展的客观法则的深刻的科学认识为基础的。在共产主义建设的各个阶段，党的政策始终是以社会主义的基本经济法则为它的指针的，这个法则就是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    苏联人民以共产党第十九次代表大会的决议为武装，正在胜利地履行第五个五年计划的任务。
    一九五三年头十个月我们的社会主义工业发展的结果证明：第五个五年计划中第三年的计划正在胜利地执行着。今年头十个月的工业总产量比去年同一时期的产量高百分之十点五，差不多为一九四○年的水平的二倍半。
    社会主义国民经济的各部门正在技术进步的基础上发展着。世界上最大的水电站的建筑、各种高效率的新式强大的工作母机、设备以及新式农业机器的生产生动地表明：共产主义的物质技术基础正在胜利地奠定中。
    科学和社会主义文化的发展也取得了显著的成就。
    苏维埃科学家正不断以知识各部门的新发现来丰富科学。我们的人民深深地尊敬并感激他们的科学家和文化工作者，并且因为他们为祖国的利益而从事坚韧、光荣的劳动而感到正当的骄傲。
    苏联人民的文学和艺术正在发展中。苏维埃作家、演员、画家和作曲家正在为人民的福利而工作。
    当然，我们在满足苏联人民日益增长的精神需要方面还是做得不够的。但是，无疑的，文学和电影戏剧工作者、艺术家和作曲家、艺术其他部门的工作者，将尽一切努力来使他们的创作趋于完美，并创作卓越地反映我们的人民以及外国人民的英雄生活和斗争的新作品。
    社会主义经济和科学在发展中所获得的胜利，保证了苏联人民物质福利的进一步提高。在过去二十八年中，我们国家的日用品的生产量增为十二倍。在一九五三年，日用品生产量将比战前一九四○年水平增加百分之七十二。
    今年，和过去几年一样，党和政府实行了连续第六次的减低制成品和食品的国家零售价格，这使居民除了其他收入以外，得到了四百六十亿卢布的好处。而且，如果我们把因最近物价的减低而引起的集体农庄市场的物价的降低计算在内，居民在十二个月中所得到的好处将不少于五百三十亿卢布。
    在一九五三年头十个月中，对居民的零售额比去年同时期增加了百分之二十。
    由于党和政府所采取的进一步扩大贸易的措施，贸易系统今年已经可以得到全年计划以外的价值三百七十多亿卢布的商品。
    共产党和苏维埃政府的主要任务是关心苏维埃人民的福利。苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说中曾着重指出，共产党和苏维埃政府认为它们在国内政策方面的主要任务是关心人民的福利，关心工人、集体农民和知识分子以及全体苏维埃人民的生活的不断提高和改善。
    最近，党和政府根据这一点，通过了若干非常重要的决议，这些决议的实施将保证日用品产量的迅速增加，农业的进一步的大力发展，苏维埃贸易的具有决定意义的改进，销售量的大大增加，房屋建筑规模的扩大；此外还采取了其他许多措施。
    这一切决议都贯串着党和政府对人民福利、对在短期内大大提高城乡人民的生活水平的深切关怀。
    这些决议具有历史性的重要意义，因为它们标志着苏维埃经济发展中的一个新阶段，就是，我们在迅速发展重工业的同时，还规定了迅速发展国民经济中直接供应日用品的部门的任务。加速发展农业、轻工业和食品工业的政策，是社会主义工业化的进一步的必然发展，是完全符合于社会主义的基本经济法则和整个社会主义国民经济有计划地、按比例地发展的法则的要求的。
    同志们！
    党和政府非常关心我们社会主义农业的全面巩固和不断发展。专门讨论进一步发展农业的党中央委员会九月全体会议，从各个角度讨论了这个问题，并且通过了具有历史意义的决议。中央委员会全体会议一方面指出社会主义农业在发展中所获得的巨大胜利，同时以纯布尔什维克式的坦白态度指出，与工业发展的速度和居民对日用品需要的增加相比较，农业发展的速度是落后了。共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在全体会议上所作的全面的报告中着重指出，在我们大规模工业发展、城市人口增加和劳动群众福利增进的速率与目前的农业生产水平之间是存在着明显的不平衡的。
    像饲畜业、马铃薯和蔬菜生产这样重要的农业部门的落后，延缓了轻工业和食品工业的进一步发展，并且大大地妨碍了集体农庄和集体农民的收入的增加。
    苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议，以及党和政府随后的决定，规定了广泛的措施，目的在于进一步巩固集体农庄制度、发展饲畜业、扩大蔬菜和马铃薯的生产、增加谷物、工业作物和含油作物的收获量，并在这个基础上增进所有集体农民的福利。
    同时还规划了根本改进机器拖拉机站的工作的重要措施。机器拖拉机站是集体农庄制度的工业、物质和技术基础。它们必须充分地成为集体农庄生产的发展中的决定性的组织力量。
    为了执行规定的措施并确保社会主义农业和饲畜业的迅速发展，今年就要在国家预算、其它国家经费以及集体农庄自己的经费中拨出大约七百亿卢布作为发展农业之用。本年度农业一共将得到十五万部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）、四万二千部联合机以及二百多万部各种各样的农业机器和工具。这是一个可观的帮助。
    但是在城市给予我们的集体耕作的各种形式的帮助中，最重要的还是在干部方面的帮助。干部决定一切。今天，由于党和全体人民要求我们的农业迅速提高到社会主义工业的水平、提高到能满足劳动人民的不断增长的需要的水平，要求集体农庄和每一个集体农民的收入大大增加；党已经号召所有农业专门人材和农业机器操使者在争取增加谷物、肉类、奶类、马铃薯产量的斗争中站在队伍的最前列。党的这个号召已经获得了热烈的响应，现在已经有大批农业专门人材、工程师和技术人员到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去工作了。
    党组织、列宁共产主义青年团、集体农庄女庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党员与非党员工人，在执行党和政府为农业所规定的任务中要发挥重大的作用。只有他们发挥劳动热情和高效率的工作，才能保证农业在短时间内得到全面发展，并增加它的收益。
    同志们！
    关于在我国生产丰富的消费品的这一重大任务的胜利完成，直接取决于我们工业中工作的进一步改进。我们必须集中我们的注意力来使管理趋于完善、提高工业部门的工作效率、进一步提高劳动生产率，并改进质量、降低生产成本。
    降低生产成本是社会主义积累的一个非常重要的来源。大家知道，就在去年一年，我们的国家就从降低生产成本中节省了四百六十亿卢布。而如果我们工作得更好的话，这只不过是我们所能够节省的一部分而已。
    不过，我们还有不少的工厂没有完成国家所规定的提高劳动生产率的任务，还有出废品的现象，而且没有作足够的努力来积极争取提高产品质量、降低生产成本。工业负责人员、企业经理、工程师和技术人员、工人、所有其他劳动人民的，首先当然是有关各部的主要责任是，消灭目前工作中存在的缺点、保证新技术的应用及其掌握、改进劳动组织，并在产品质量不断提高的条件下，大大提高生产率。
    党、苏维埃、工会和列宁共产主义青年团组织的任务是，用各种办法来发挥群众的积极性和主动性，更广泛地展开争取完成和超额完成生产计划、提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本和提高产品质量的社会主义竞赛。
    苏联人民的创造力是用之不竭的。
    我们光荣的、先进的工人的劳动，是人民的爱国劳动的榜样。这些杰出的男女工人，我们伟大人民的儿女，是全体苏联工人的榜样。他们的经验应该大力加以推广，应该成为全体劳动人民的劳动的基础。
    英明的列宁和他的事业的继承者伟大的斯大林曾一再指出，工人阶级与农民的联盟是苏维埃制度的力量和稳固的基础。他们认为，工人阶级和劳动农民的牢不可破的联盟，是无产阶级专政的最高原则。在共产党领导下的工人阶级与农民的联盟，是一个决定性的力量，它保证了我们在一九一七年十月的胜利和我们国家社会主义的胜利建成。这个联盟的巩固也是我们进一步向着共产主义前进的保证。党和政府关于发展农业和提高人民生活水平的措施，将进一步加强工人阶级与农民的联盟，进一步加强我们全体人民在精神上和政治上的团结。
    同志们！
    多民族的苏维埃国家永远巩固了苏联各族人民的友谊，这个国家的成立是十月革命的最大成果。我们的国家根本没有民族冲突。十月革命为我们伟大祖国各民族的经济与文化的迅速发展创造了条件。
    我们正处在一个伟大日子的前夕——明年一月将是乌克兰和俄罗斯重新联合的三百周年。这个节日不仅对俄罗斯人和乌克兰人是一个伟大的节日，而且对苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟其他各民族人民也是一个伟大的节日。
    俄罗斯和乌克兰人民以及我们伟大祖国的其他各族人民的兄弟般的、牢不可破的联盟和友谊，是多民族的苏维埃国家的不可战胜的力量的源泉。
    伟大的苏维埃国家各族人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    进一步加强苏维埃国家是在我国胜利建成共产主义的主要条件之一。作为一个新的、最民主的国家管理形式的苏维埃，已经在争取人民的幸福和自由的斗争中经受过考验。我们必须从各方面来加强苏维埃国家，使苏维埃的工作做到尽善尽美，并加强它们和广大群众的联系。
    同时，我们有责任从各个方面来加强苏维埃国家的武装部队，他们正保卫着我们祖国的自由和独立，保卫着我们爱好和平的人民的和平建设劳动。
    苏联人民充满了为在共产主义建设中取得新成就、为社会主义祖国的繁荣而努力的精力和决心。共产党和它的中央委员会以及苏维埃政府的英明领导，是我们国家沿着建设共产主义社会的道路继续前进的保证。
    同志们！
    和平建设工作的巨大规模以及共产党和政府为了进一步发展国民经济和继续提高苏联人民的生活水平所采取的空前规模和空前重大的措施，极其清楚地证明了我们的党和苏联政府所奉行的政策的爱好和平的性质。
    力量强大和团结如一的苏维埃政府，始终奉行着维护和加强世界和平、发展与各国的睦邻关系、发展和加强国际经济联系的政策。
    我们的外交政策的总路线过去一直如此，而且永不更改。
    以美国反动势力为首的帝国主义阵营奉行着准备新战争的政策。大家知道，由于美国侵略集团处心积虑的活动，“冷战”仍在继续中，而且愈来愈紧张。对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所进行的肆无忌惮的卑鄙的污蔑活动，不但没有停止，而且日益加紧。美国政府明目张胆地拨出成亿的美元作为在民主阵营各国进行破坏活动之用，继续奉行扩充军备的政策，拚凑军事集团，加紧在和民主阵营各国的边界毗邻的地方建立稠密的军事基地网。所有这些事实自然不能不引起一切爱好和平的人民的深刻不安。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订和朝鲜流血的停止，对于缓和国际紧张局势是一个巨大的贡献。大家知道，苏联和中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家一起，不倦地为停止强加于朝鲜人民身上的残酷的、非正义的、侵略的战争而斗争。
    既然侵略者的计划在朝鲜遭到了失败，那么，再一次提一下朝鲜战争中的一些有益的教训，是有用处的。
    帝国主义侵略者对朝鲜进行武装干涉，本来是梦想以此来奴役朝鲜人民，同时把已经起来为自己的独立和民主自由而斗争的亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民的民族解放运动，淹没在血泊中。但是当侵略者还在打算盘的时候，捍卫着自由和独立的各国人民就已经严阵以待了。
    朝鲜的事态证明，亚洲各国人民有充分的决心来捍卫自己的民族自由和独立，制止在远东建立新世界大战的温床。
    帝国主义者应该接受这样一个真理：他们横行无忌地对被奴役的殖民地和附属国的人民作威作福的时代早就过去了。这些国家的人民的历史命运已经有了根本的转变。亚洲各国人民要成为他们的土地和他们的命运的完全的主人。
    在亚洲，一个伟大的人民民主国家——中华人民共和国诞生了，它是亚洲和全世界的和平与进步的一个稳定因素。这个伟大的国家阻止着帝国主义为所欲为地奉行把亚洲变成新世界大战的策源地的政策。它是东方被压迫人民争取自由、民主和真正独立的斗争的强大堡垒。
    谈到这里，不能不提一提帝国主义国家所采取的反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位的立场。这种立场无疑地促成了国际局势的继续紧张。在解决最重要的国际问题，特别是有关远东的问题时，不能忽视伟大的中国人民。没有中华人民共和国的参加，根本谈不到什么缓和国际紧张局势和解决亚洲问题。
    朝鲜停战为缓和国际紧张局势奠定了有利的基础。然而，这是不合帝国主义国家的胃口的，因为它们的计划中没有使国际关系正常化这一项。可以以下列事实为例说明这一点：西方国家对苏联关于召开美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国五国代表会议以讨论缓和国际紧张局势的一般措施的建议，采取默不作声的态度。美国统治集团在朝鲜政治会议问题上所采取的立场也证明了这一点。这种立场不能不引起那些力求尽速彻底解决朝鲜问题与和平解决远东其他悬而未决的问题的人们的忧虑。美国代表们不愿意政治会议成为一个不但有交战双方、而且有有关中立国家参加的圆桌会议。同时应当指出，像印度这样一个亚洲的大国在结束朝鲜战争方面是有不小的功绩的。然而美国竟忽视印度，拒绝邀请印度和其他一些中立国家参加朝鲜政治会议。显然，帝国主义侵略者没有放弃用扩大侵略的办法来征服亚洲人民的疯狂计划。
    德国问题的解决对缓和目前国际紧张局势的重大意义是无论怎样估计都不算过分的。
    苏联希望欧洲和平得到保障和巩固，并希望德国人民的民族利益得到尊重，曾不止一次地向西方国家提出关于公正解决德国问题的建议。苏联政府相信：如果召开和平会议，来讨论有关缔结对德和约、成立全德临时政府、举行全德选举、减轻德国由于战争所承担的财政经济义务等问题，那么，德国问题是能够而且应当为了和平的利益并照顾到德国人民的民族愿望而得到解决的。
    西方国家对苏联建议所采取的态度不能证明它们愿意公正地解决德国问题，也不能证明它们愿意考虑——更谈不上尊重——德国人民的民族利益。在它们对苏联建议所作的一切答复中，它们忽视了德国问题的所有重要方面，如关于缔结对德和约、成立全德政府、减轻德国所承担的财政经济义务等方面的问题。它们伪善地把所谓全德选举问题提到首要地位，而令人难以理解的是：在德国分裂成两部分的情况下如何谈得上举行全德选举；在德国还没有一个全德政府的情况下如何谈得上什么选举。
    此外，西方国家对德国的一贯政策暴露了它们的真正意图，这种意图不是要巩固欧洲和平，而是要把西德变成欧洲新战争的温床。美、英统治集团公开奉行着使西德重新军国主义化的政策；加速恢复西德的武装部队。按照它们的计划，这支武装部队将成为它们正在拼凑的侵略性的“欧洲军”的骨干。近来，自从波恩联邦议院选举之后，复活德国军国主义的政策来得特别露骨了。西德的好战的军国主义集团公开发表复仇主义的声明，攻击波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国，攻击苏联。他们对法国，特别是对德意志民主共和国发出威胁的论调。这些论调是得到美国和英国的领导人物的充分支持的，这些领导人物说，如果法国拒绝批准关于建立所谓“欧洲防御集团”的巴黎条约，那末，西德以及它的恢复了的武装部队，将不管法国怎样，直接加入侵略性的北大西洋联盟。
    不得不考虑到各国人民对和平的渴望的西方国家代表，不时地说到他们愿意和苏联就悬而未决的问题获致协议，以便使紧张局势得到缓和。但是，要判断这种说法和西方国家所执行的政策有着多么大的距离，可以看它们对解决德国问题所持的态度。西方国家口头上赞成召开有苏联参加讨论德国问题的会议。在行动上，他们不惜用一切手段，来加速批准规定西德加入侵略性的大西洋联盟的巴黎与波恩的军国主义条约。显然，由于这类条约的批准，德国就不可能重新合并为一个统一的、民主的和爱好和平的国家。
    西方国家一方面表示赞成和苏联讨论德国问题，但同时，它们在伦敦会议上却缔结了一个单独的协定，这个协定规定西德参加矛头指向苏联的侵略性大西洋体系。
    难道西方国家的这种立场，不是事先就使四国会议关于德国问题的讨论流于空洞吗？这里，难道不是西方国家企图强制苏联接受它们在德国问题上的立场，而一旦不得逞时，便责备苏联“不愿意”和平解决德国问题，从而欺骗世界舆论吗？
    反对和平解决德国问题的人们应该知道：各国爱好和平的人民警惕地注视着他们准备战争的一切阴谋。各国人民十分清楚：不十分清醒的华盛顿政客们，在英、法两国某些百依百顺的领袖们的帮助和怂恿下，正在复活西德的侵略温床，这种行径就等于玩火。
    清醒的德国政治家不能不认识到，波恩复仇主义者引导他们所走的那条道路，充满了对全德国说来是致命的后果。
    使西德重新军国主义化和把它拖进侵略性的大西洋联盟的政策，和在与苏联及人民民主国家接壤的一些欧洲国家建立军事基地的政策，有着不可分割的关系。无疑的，上面谈到的情况只是某种策划反对民主阵营国家的战争的政策的各个方面而已。然而也需要从这些方面作出适当的结论。
    凡是真正想缓和国际紧张局势的人，便不能漠视关于取消在别国领土上建立军事基地的问题。苏联过去一再向西方国家提出过这个问题，而且现在还是坚决向它们提出这个问题。可是，每一次它们都置之不理。美国近来竟加紧对挪威和丹麦施用压力，要它们提供基地，它还跟希腊和佛朗哥西班牙缔结了关于军事基地的协定，同时千方百计地促使伊朗及其他近东中东国家也这样做。
    西方国家顽固地抗拒采取禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模杀人武器的决定和大国裁减军备的决定。他们声称联合国正在讨论这些问题。然而谁都知道，联合国自从成立以来就一直在讨论这些问题，这种毫无结果的讨论是没有尽头的。
    现在，各国人民不相信那些不能见诸行动的话了。而帝国主义国家统治集团的行动说明他们是和平的敌人，是执行在各国人民之间挑拨仇恨以便于准备新战争的政策的人。
    苏联一贯地、坚持不渝地奉行和平与各国人民友好的政策。譬如，苏联扩大与外国的经济联系的政策就是为了这个目的。我们与人民民主国家的经济关系一年比一年发展和加强。同时，今年苏联还跟法国、意大利、阿根廷、芬兰、瑞典和其他许多国家签订了贸易协定。我们十分重视加强国际贸易联系，因为这有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。我们今后仍然要在互利的基础上尽力促进国与国之间的贸易的扩大。
    强大的民主和社会主义国家阵营，由无产阶级国际主义的思想牢固地团结起来，它正满怀信心地沿着经济、政治和文化各方面的进一步高涨的道路前进，它对国际局势发生着越来越大的、有利于进步、和平和民主的良好影响。
    和平力量日益增长、日益壮大，并已成为巩固世界和平的重大因素。值得注意的是，今年召开的妇女、青年和工会等世界代表大会，都是在亿万人民热望团结一致，为和平、为反对军备竞赛、为反对垄断资本家对劳动人民的权利和自由的进攻的标志下进行的。劳动人民的力量，一切希望维护和平、制止战争的人们的力量就在于团结。
    同志们！三十六年前由于十月革命的胜利而在我国建立的苏维埃制度，一年比一年有力地影响着世界历史的进程。十月革命所宣布的原则，现在已成为一种巨大的力量，它团结着强大的社会主义民主阵营，鼓舞着千百万劳动人民为自由和进步而进行奋不顾身的斗争。
    纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年，我们有权利以苏联各族人民的成就骄傲。
    我们面前的任务是艰巨的。为了完成这些任务，要求我们作更大的努力，和克服我们道路上的一切困难的决心。苏联人民从来不害怕任何困难。我们有充分信心说，苏联人民，在光荣的共产党的领导下，有百战百胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说的鼓舞下，一定可以坚定不移地前进，在共产主义的建设中取得新的胜利。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年万岁！
    国际和平万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，在共产党的领导下，向着共产主义的胜利前进！
      （经久不息的、暴风雨般的掌声，向苏联共产党、向党的中央委员会和苏联政府致敬的欢呼声响彻会场。）
