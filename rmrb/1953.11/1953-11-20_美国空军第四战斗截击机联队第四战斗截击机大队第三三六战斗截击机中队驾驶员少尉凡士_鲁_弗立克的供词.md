Confession of Second Lieutenant Vance R. Flick, Pilot of the 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, U.S. Air Force

I am Vance R. Flick, Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-2208933, twenty-four years old. My current home is at 1006 Highland Road, Lexington, Missouri, USA.

I was drafted into the Air Force on October 1, 1950, and assigned to Perrin Air Force Base in Sherman, Texas, where I entered base flight school. Later, I completed advanced pilot training at Craig Air Force Base in Selma, Alabama. Subsequently, I received gunnery training at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona. Around January 1, 1952, at Luke Base, a civilian gave us a lecture on germ warfare. The lecture took place in the afternoon inside the ground school building. Those attending the lecture were myself, Second Lieutenant Lawrence Wolf, and five others.

As far as I can remember, the lecturer mainly gave us a brief description of several types of bacteriological weapons that could be used by F-51 aircraft. He said that he did not know whether we would use bacteriological weapons. If we were to use them, we would have more detailed lessons on their use. This time, it was just a simple lecture on several types of bacteriological weapons used by F-51 aircraft. He told us that there were two kinds of bacteriological bombs, and also a spraying device that could be mounted on F-51 aircraft to disperse bacteria.

First, the lecturer talked about the 500-pound bacteriological bomb. The appearance of this bomb was the same as that of a 500-pound high-explosive bomb. The interior was divided into compartments, in which bacteria-carrying insects or bacteria were placed. This type of 500-pound bomb could be fitted with an instantaneous fuse, a ten-second delay fuse, or a time fuse. Since we had already learned about these fuses, he did not talk about their operation. Since we pilots were not involved in loading the bacteria into the bombs or mounting the bombs on the aircraft, he did not describe this aspect. The 500-pound bacteriological bomb was dropped in the same way as other 500-pound bombs. It could be used against towns, troop concentration areas, and any other targets that required a direct hit. This bomb was very accurate in hitting its target. When the fuse detonated, the compartments of the bomb would open, and the bacteria-carrying insects or bacteria would escape.

Another type of bacteriological bomb was the parachute type. This bomb was also divided into compartments, in which bacteria-carrying insects or bacteria were placed. This type of bomb was mostly used against large targets such as towns.

The last type of bacteriological weapon the lecturer talked to us about was the spraying device. He said, "The bacteria used in bacteriological weapons are of various types, but you will probably be told which bacteria or bacteria-carrying insects to use." The germ warfare lecture at Luke Base ended here.

I left Stoneman Barracks on February 21st and arrived in Japan on February 26th, from where I went to K-10 Base with the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. K-10 Base, located in Chinhae, was the maintenance base for the group. I arrived at K-10 Base on March 2nd and arrived at K-46 Base near Wonju around March 23rd. This was the group's operational base. I was assigned to the 39th Squadron.

While I was with the 18th Group, I attended map reading and identification classes, intelligence classes, ground warfare situation classes, and germ warfare classes. From March 2, 1952, to the end of April 1952, I only participated in five combat missions with the 18th Group, one of which was a germ warfare mission.

The germ warfare class was taught around 19:00 on March 28, 1952, in the group briefing room. The instructor for this class was Captain McLaughlin, the group intelligence officer. There were fifteen people in the class. Captain McLaughlin began by telling us that this was a germ warfare class, and he would explain to us the reasons for conducting germ warfare, the various types of germ weapons, the various types of fuses used, and the various types of bacteria or insects. He said that we had better listen carefully to what he said and learn it well, because whether we liked it or not, if we were called upon, that was what we would have to do.

He said: Germ bombs would greatly shorten this war, causing disease and casualties within the enemy's army, destroying the army's combat capability and morale, so in the long run, it would shorten the war and save many lives. Whether we liked germ warfare or not was not for us to decide, because we were in the Air Force, and the Air Force Command said that you were to drop these bombs on the enemy. We were going to use it to shorten the war and save American lives.

He said: The Chinese and North Korean armies have absolute numerical superiority, far beyond what our army can cope with, and their fortifications are so well dug that ordinary bombs cannot harm them, so we must use everything we can to kill them. The answer lies in our effective use of germ bombs.

Captain McLaughlin also told us about the various types of fuses used in germ weapons. What he told us was largely the same as what the lecturer at Luke Base had already said.

Next, he explained when to use which type of germ weapon. One similar to a 500-pound bomb was used against targets that needed to be hit directly or were difficult to hit. It could be used against small villages, troop concentration areas, and the like. It could be aimed and hit like a 500-pound bomb, while others could not. Spraying could be used directly, but it had to be used at low altitude, while germ bombs could be dropped from almost any altitude. Spraying devices were used against large areas, such as places where the population was distributed over a wide area. It was best used in valleys where there was no wind or only a slight breeze, so that the insects or bacteria would fall more directly and not be blown away from the target by the wind. Later, I personally saw four aircraft from the 18th Group equipped with this device.

The next type was the parachute type, and this germ bomb was used to drop over cities or other residential areas.

Captain McLaughlin pointed out to us: The operational area for the 18th Group's germ warfare roughly started from the front line north to Sepo-ri, Yangdok, Baekseok-ri, Deokcheon, and Gunuri. The boundary then turned from Gunuri through Taechon, Gasan, Sonchon, and then south from Sonchon to the coast.

Finally, he said: All this information about germ warfare must not be discussed inside or outside the base. Even the pilots must not discuss it among themselves.

When carrying out special missions, germ bombs were loaded onto the aircraft on the taxiway outside the end of the runway. After using the spraying device, it had to be rinsed with chemicals to disinfect it.

I carried out a germ warfare mission on April 1, 1952, targeting a village about ten or fifteen miles east of Pyongyang.

At 6:00 AM on April 1, 1952, I received an order from the 39th Squadron Operations Officer to report to the group briefing room at 8:00 AM. I reported to the group briefing room on time. First, the Group Operations Officer, Captain Ralston, told us that we were to carry out a germ warfare mission that day. We were to carry two five-inch diameter rockets on one wing and a 500-pound germ bomb on the other wing. He pointed out on a map that the place we were to attack was a village ten or fifteen miles east of Pyongyang. We were to take off at 14:00. He had a map for us to study the location we were going to attack, so that we could easily identify it when we arrived there. He explained that we were to fly straight to the target, and then fly directly back to the base after bombing. Then Captain McLaughlin told us that there was not expected to be much anti-aircraft fire, but not to get too close to Pyongyang, because there was anti-aircraft fire there.

Next, the weather officer told us that the weather in the target area should be clear. Then, the ground liaison officer told us about the front line activity the previous night, the ground signals used by the army, and the password.

Afterwards, we went to the front of the room and looked at the pictures of the target area. Then we went back to our rooms and didn't leave until it was time to take off.

At 13:30, we headed towards the planes parked on the taxiway. The germ bombs had already been loaded onto the planes, and two specialized ordnance personnel were standing next to my plane. We took off at 14:00 and flew directly to the target, beginning a dive bombing run with a three-second interval, and then firing rockets. After attacking the town, we climbed to the left, reformed our formation, and flew south. Around 16:00, we landed at K-46 base.

After landing, we all went to report. Captain McLaughlin gave the report. He asked us questions about the mission, and we answered. We told Captain McLaughlin that the mission had been carried out according to orders.

This was my only germ warfare mission while I was with the 18th Group.

On May 1, 1952, I and eighteen other pilots were transferred from the 18th Group to the 4th Group at K-14 Kimpo Air Base. I was assigned to the 336th Squadron. I stayed at K-14 base until May 3rd, and then I was sent to Tsuiki Base in Japan for training in flying F-86 aircraft. The training at Tsuiki was just to familiarize us with the F-86 aircraft. On May 20, 1952, I was sent back to K-14 base to continue training.

During my flight training at K-14 base, I attended two classes. Each class lasted one hour. The classes were given especially for us eighteen people. The first class was a germ warfare class, and the second class was about the general procedure for group briefings.

The germ warfare class was taught by Lieutenant Ledland, the group intelligence officer, at 19:00 on May 23, 1952, in the group briefing room.

As far as I can remember, the main content of Lieutenant Ledland's lecture was as follows: First, he told us that how we felt about this matter was irrelevant. The Air Force Command gave us thorough flight training, not just to teach us how to fly, but because they had a job for us to do, and whatever that job was, we had to do our best to complete it.

He then said, "To successfully and quickly end the war, conducting germ warfare in North Korea and Northeast China is necessary. The enemy's supply lines run through Northeast China and Korea, and we must do everything we can to stop supplies from reaching the front lines. We must kill a large number of their manpower so that they cannot continue to effectively transport supplies to Korea, we must destroy the will of the Chinese and Korean people so that they demand an end to the war to avoid being bombed, and we must kill the replacement troops who come to Korea so that they lose their strength. Under such bombing, the people and even the army will lose their desire to fight, and then the war will end."

Next, he turned to the types of germ bombs that we F-86 pilots would use. He said: Currently, the most commonly used are the tank-type germ bombs, which use typhoid, yellow fever, cholera, bubonic plague, and typhus. The insects used are flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice.

He then talked about another type of germ bomb, the 500-pound bomb, which has compartments for storing bacteria or insects. The bacteria and insects used in this type of bomb are the same as those used in the tank type.

Lieutenant Ledland said: Anyone taking a germ bomb to Northeast China should carry one external fuel tank and one germ bomb, and fly between Sinuiju and the Supung Dam, and usually fly back the same way. If the fuel is low, then fly directly back to K-14 base from Northeast China. If there is still fuel left after dropping the bomb, look for MiG aircraft, but after going to Northeast China, the fuel is almost always so low that you almost have to return directly.

Lieutenant Ledland also told us: This germ warfare class is top secret, and we should not even discuss it among ourselves.

I received orders for my second mission at 20:00 on June 18, 1952. Our squadron reported to the group briefing room as ordered at 13:30 on the 19th. Because this was a special briefing, only four pilots were present.

First, the ground liaison officer reported on the front line activity the previous night, the current location of the front line, the color of the ground signals used by the army, the password, and the sorties flown by other aircraft the previous day.

Second, the operations officer said, "You are to take off at 15:00, the target is a valley fifteen miles south of Sinuiju, with villages in it. If you encounter MiG aircraft, drop the bombs anywhere. You are carrying two germ bombs and no external fuel, so remember to pay attention to your fuel reserves."

Then, Lieutenant Ledland said, "You will be carrying two tank-type germ bombs. You are to drop all your germ bombs at once in formation flight. When near Sinuiju, watch out for anti-aircraft fire. Because you will be flying close to Sinuiju, where there is a lot of anti-aircraft fire."

After that, the weather officer told us that the weather should be almost clear, but with a small amount of scattered clouds.

After the group briefing, we went to the squadron briefing room, where the squadron leader gave us another briefing. The content of his briefing to us was largely the same. Then we all put on our equipment and began to walk towards our planes. I saw specialized ordnance personnel just loading the germ bombs onto my plane. We took off in a spread formation at 15:00. The time we arrived over the target was 15:25. We dropped all the germ bombs in a spread formation. We began our return flight at about 15:30, and landed at K-14 base at about 15:53.

During my time with the 4th Group, I learned from conversations with some pilots that the first germ bombs used by the 4th Group were tank-type germ bombs, and after that, 500-pound germ bombs were used. Both types of germ bombs were in use when I was shot down.

My last mission was on June 21, 1952. It was a normal MiG search mission. We were flying between Sinuiju and the Supung Dam. I was shot down about ten miles south of Sinuiju.

The morale of the 4th Group pilots was not very high, mainly because they were constantly living in fear of having to carry out a germ mission. If it was just a question of fighting MiG aircraft, I don't believe morale would have been low, but it wouldn't have been very high either, because no one was interested in the war.

    美国空军第四战斗截击机联队第四战斗截击机大队第三三六战斗截击机中队驾驶员少尉凡士·鲁·弗立克的供词
    我是凡士·鲁·弗立克，美国空军少尉，军号AO—2208933，二十四岁。我家现住美国密苏里州，列克星敦城海兰路一○○六号。
    我于一九五○年十月一日被召参加空军，被派至美国得克萨斯州歇尔曼的培林空军基地，进入基地飞行学校。后来至美国亚拉巴马州西尔马的克莱格空军基地完成高级驾驶员训练。随后至美国亚利桑那州费匿克斯的卢克空军基地受射击训练。约于一九五二年一月一日在卢克基地曾有一个文官给我们上过一课细菌战课程，该课是下午在地面学校大厦内进行的。听课人员为我本人、劳伦斯·沃尔夫少尉及其他五人。
    据我记忆所及，讲课者主要向我们简单描述了F—51型飞机可能使用的几种细菌武器，他说，他不知道我们会不会使用细菌武器，如果使用细菌武器，我们还会上到关于它们使用方面的更详细的课程。这次仅是关于F—51型飞机所使用的几种细菌武器的简单讲课。他告诉我们细菌弹有两种，还有一种喷射设备，可装在F—51型飞机上以散布细菌。
    首先，讲课人谈到五百磅型细菌弹。这种弹的外形如五百磅高度爆炸弹一样。内分数格，带菌昆虫或细菌即置于其中。此种五百磅型弹可装置瞬发信管，十秒钟延期信管或定时信管。由于我们曾经学过这些信管，故他没有谈及信管的操作。由于我们驾驶员是不管将细菌装于弹中以及将弹装于飞机上的事情，他也就未叙述此方面的问题。五百磅型细菌弹之投掷与其他五百磅炸弹相同。它可用于城镇、部队集结区以及其他需要直接命中之任何目标。此弹命中目标甚为准确。当信管爆发时，弹的分格即行开启，带菌昆虫或细菌即行逸出。
    另一种细菌弹为降落伞型。此弹亦分为数格，带菌昆虫或细菌即置于其中，此种弹多用于像城镇那样大目标。
    讲课者对我们所讲的最后一种细菌武器为喷射设备。他说：“细菌武器所使用的细菌是多种的，但是你们大概将被告知使用何种细菌或带菌昆虫”，在卢克基地的细菌战讲课就讲到此处为止。
    我于二月二十一日自史东曼兵营出国，二月二十六日抵达日本，即从该地赴K—10基地第十八战斗轰炸机大队。K—10基地位于镇海，为大队之保养基地。我于三月二日抵K—10基地，约于三月二十三日抵原州附近之K—46基地。该处为大队之作战基地。我被派在第三十九中队。
    我在第十八大队时上过地图判读识别课、情报课、地面战况课和细菌战课。自一九五二年三月二日起至一九五二年四月底，我在第十八大队仅参加五次战斗任务，其中一次是细菌战任务。
    细菌战课约于一九五二年三月二十八日十九时在大队简令室讲授。大队情报官麦克拉夫林上尉是这课的教员，上课的共有十五人。麦克拉夫林上尉开头就告诉我们说，这是细菌战课，他将说明我们进行细菌战的理由，细菌武器的各种类型，所使用的各种信管及各种类型的细菌或昆虫。他说，我们最好仔细听他讲，并学好他所讲的，因为不管我们喜欢与否，假如一号召那就是我们所要做的事。
    他说：细菌弹会大大地缩短这场战争，会在对方军队内引起疫病和伤亡，破坏军队的战斗能力和精神，所以长期来看会缩短战争并节省许多生命。我们喜欢细菌战与否不由我们来决定，因为我们是在空军里，而空军司令部说，你们要向敌人投掷这些弹。我们将要使用它，借以缩短战争，节省美国人的性命。
    他说：中国和北朝鲜军队数量上占绝对优势，远非我们军队所能应付，并且他们的工事挖得太好，以致通常的炸弹不能伤害他们，所以，我们必须使用一切能杀害他们的东西。答案就在于我们对细菌弹的有效使用。
    麦克拉夫林上尉也对我们讲了所使用的细菌武器的种种类型信管。他对我们所讲的与在卢克基地的授课人所已讲的大致相同。
    其次，他解释了何时使用何种细菌武器。与五百磅炸弹相似的一种是用来对付要直接命中的目标或是难以命中的目标的。它可以用来对付小村庄、军队集结区及类似的地方。它像五百磅炸弹一样能被瞄准和击中，而其他的则不能。喷射是能被直接使用的，但必须在低空使用，而细菌弹则几乎能在任何高度被投下。喷射设备是用来对付大块地区的，如人口分布在广大区域的地方。最好是在山谷中没有风或只有微风的地方使用，以使这些昆虫或细菌会更直接的落下去而不致从目标处被风吹跑。后来我亲眼看到第十八大队的四架飞机装有这种设备。
    其次一种是降落伞型，这种细菌弹是用来在城市或其他居民区上空投掷的。
    麦克拉夫林上尉对我们指出：第十八大队进行细菌战的作战地区大致起自前线北至洗浦里、阳德、白石里、德川、军隅里，该界线复自军隅里折经泰川、龟城、宣川然后由宣川南至海岸。
    最后，他说：所有这些有关细菌战的情况不得在基地以内或以外讨论。甚至驾驶员也不得在他们中间讨论。
    在执行特殊任务时，细菌弹是在跑道尾端外的滑行道上装上飞机的。在使用喷射装置后，要用化学药品冲洗喷射装置，以资消毒。
    我执行细菌战任务是在一九五二年四月一日，目标在平壤以东十或十五英里处一个村庄的上空。
    一九五二年四月一日上午六时，我接到第三十九中队作战官的命令，要我在上午八时到大队简令室报到。我按时到大队简令室报到。首先，大队作战官罗尔斯顿上尉告诉我们说：我们要在该日执行一次细菌战任务。我们要在一个机翼上携带两个五英寸直径的火箭而在另一个机翼上携带一个五百磅型的细菌弹。他在地图上指出，我们要袭击的地点是在平壤以东十或十五英里的一个村庄。我们要在十四时起飞。他有一张供我们研究我们将袭击的地点的地图。以使我们抵达该地时易于识别。他解释说，我们要一直飞至目标，在轰炸后就直接飞回基地。接着麦克拉夫林上尉告诉我们，意料中没有什么高射炮火，但不要靠近平壤，因为那边有高射炮火。
    接着气象官告诉我们在目标地区的天气该是晴朗的。其次，地面联络官告诉了我们前夜前线的活动，陆军使用的地面信号以及口令。
    以后我们走到房间的前部，看了一下目标地区的照片。接着我们就回到自己的房间，一直到将要起飞时才离开。
    在十三时三十分，我们走向停在滑行道上的飞机。细菌弹已经装上飞机，并有两名专门的军械人员站在我的机旁。我们在十四时起飞，直接飞抵目标，以三秒钟间隔开始俯冲投弹，然后发射火箭。袭击该小镇以后，我们向左方上升，恢复队形，朝南飞去。十六时左右，降落在K—46基地。
    着陆后，我们都去汇报。由麦克拉夫林上尉汇报。他问我们有关任务问题，我们回答。我们告诉麦克拉夫林上尉：任务已按照命令执行。
    这是我在第十八大队时唯一的一次细菌战任务。
    一九五二年五月一日我和另外十八个驾驶员从第十八大队被调到在K—14金浦空军基地的第四大队。我被派往第三百三十六中队。我在K—14基地一直呆到五月三日，接着就被送往日本筑城基地受驾驶F—86型飞机的训练，在筑城的训练只是熟悉F—86型飞机。一九五二年五月二十日我被送回K—14基地继续受训练。
  在K—14基地受飞行训练期间，我上了两堂课。每课长一小时，该课系特别为我们十八个人上的，第一课是细菌战课，第二课是关于大队简令的
  一般程序。
    细菌战课由大队情报官利得兰尉官于一九五二年五月二十三日十九时在大队简令室讲授。
    就我记忆所及，利得兰尉官讲课的主要内容如下：首先，他告诉我们，我们对这件事的感觉如何是无关紧要的。空军司令部给予我们彻底的飞行训练，不是只为了教我们飞行，而是因为他们有一件工作要我们去做，不管那工作是什么，我们要尽最大努力去完成它。
    他接着说：“要成功和迅速地结束战争，在北朝鲜及中国东北进行细菌战是必要的。敌人供应线穿过中国东北和朝鲜，我们必须做任何我们所能做的事来阻止供应物资抵达前线。我们必须大量杀伤他们的人力以使他们不能继续有效地运送物资到朝鲜来，我们必须破坏中国和朝鲜人民的意志，使他们要求停止战争以避免被轰炸，我们必须杀伤他们来到朝鲜的补充部队，使他们失去实力。在这样轰炸下，人民以至军队将失去作战愿望，然后战争就会结束。”
    接着，他把题目转到我们F—86型飞机驾驶员将使用的细菌弹的类型。他说：目前我们最常用的是油箱型的细菌弹，其中使用的细菌是伤寒、黄热病、霍乱、腺鼠疫和斑疹伤寒，使用的昆虫是苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤和虱子。
    他接着讲到另一种细菌弹，即五百磅型弹，内有贮藏细菌或昆虫的隔室，在这种炸弹内使用的细菌和昆虫与油箱型的一样。
    利得兰尉官说：任何人带细菌弹到中国东北去时，要带一只机外副油箱及一枚细菌弹，而且要从新义州及水丰蓄水池之间飞过去，并通常从原路飞回。假如燃料少了，那么就从中国东北直接飞回K—14基地。假如在投弹后仍有剩余燃料，就找寻米格飞机，但是到中国东北去过以后，燃料差不多总是少了，以致几乎必须直接返航。
    利得兰尉官还对我们说：该细菌课是绝密的，甚至在我们自己之间也不要讨论。
      我于一九五二年六月十八日二十时接到第二次任务的命令。我们小队于十九日十三时三十分按照命令到大队简令室报到。因为这是一次特别简令，所以只有四名驾驶员在场。
    首先，地面联络官报告了前夜前线的活动，目前前线的位置，陆军所使用的地面信号的颜色，口令以及前一日其他飞机飞行的架次。
    其次，作战官说：“你们要在十五时起飞，目标是新义州以南十五英里的一个山谷，其中有村庄。如果遇到米格飞机，就随地把弹投下，你们带两枚细菌弹而没有机外燃料，所以，记住要注意你们的燃料贮存量”。
    接着，利得兰尉官说：“你们将携带两枚油箱型细菌弹。你们要在编队飞行中一下子全部投下你们的细菌弹。在新义州附近时，要注意高射炮火。因为你们要飞近新义州，而该处高射炮火甚多。”
    此后，气象官告诉我们，天气应该是近乎晴朗的，但有少量浮云。
    大队简令后，我们到中队简令室，由小队领队又作了简令，他对我们的简令内容大致相同。接着我们都穿上装备，开始向我们的飞机走去。我看到特殊军械人员刚把细菌弹装上我的飞机。我们在十五时起飞成展开队形。到达目标上空的时间是十五时二十五分，我们以展开队形把细菌弹全部投了下去。我们约于十五时三十分开始返航，约于十五时五十三分在K—14基地降落。
    我在第四大队时期，从与一些驾驶员们的谈话中知道第四大队最初使用的细菌弹是油箱型细菌弹，继此以后所用的是五百磅型细菌弹。这两种细菌弹在我被击落时，均在使用中。
    我最后一次任务是在一九五二年六月二十一日。它是一次通常的搜索米格机的任务。我们飞行在新义州和水丰蓄水池之间，我在新义州以南约十英里处被击落。
    第四大队的驾驶员的士气不太高，主要因为他们始终生活在可能要执行一次细菌任务的恐惧中。假如仅是一个与米格飞机作战的问题，我不相信士气会低落，但也不会很高，因为没有一个人对战争有兴趣。
