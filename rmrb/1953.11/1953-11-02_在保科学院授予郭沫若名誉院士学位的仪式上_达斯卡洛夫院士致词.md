Academician Daskalov's Speech at the Ceremony of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Conferring Honorary Academician Title to Guo Moruo

Respected Academician Guo Moruo:

I am now performing a very pleasant task, which is, based on the suggestion of the Department (Institute) of Linguistics, Anthropology, and Literature of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, to elect you as an honorary academician of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences at the plenary annual meeting of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences on February 3, 4, and 10, 1952; I now present you with the academician certificate.

Our Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and cultural circles' election of you, a prominent representative of Chinese science and culture, as an honorary academician is not accidental or ordinary. It is a huge cultural event.

We Bulgarians consider you a great modern Chinese writer, the author of the famous poems "The Goddess," "Recovery," and "Avant-Garde," the author of novels such as "My Childhood," "Fallen Leaves," "The Knight," "Ten Years of Creation," "Before and After the Revolution," and the author of moving dramas such as "Qu Yuan," "The Flowers of the Pear Tree," and other works, as well as literary criticism and political essays such as "From Literary Revolution to Revolutionary Literature" and others. Throughout your literary career, you have used high skills to severely criticize the old feudal order and tradition, resist social injustice, and resist imperialist aggression in China. Throughout your life in literature, you have waged uncompromising resistance against aggression, reaction, and injustice. Your poems are a battle cry for the unremitting struggle for a better, just, and happy life.

In addition, we know that you are one of the greatest scientists in Chinese history, and you have made outstanding contributions to the study of ancient Chinese history. Particularly valuable are your historical works: "A Study of Ancient Chinese Society" and "The Age of Slavery," which are the first works to use the historical materialist viewpoint to study the issue of dividing the chronology of Chinese social development.

We also know that you are one of the brave and unwavering fighters against imperialism and the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek regime. Because of your progressive ideas and participation in revolutionary struggles, you have often been persecuted, arrested, injured, and even sentenced. During the years of the Anti-Japanese War, you stood at the forefront of progressive Chinese literary and artistic activists, using your own articles, reports, and passionate speeches to oppose Japanese aggression and mobilize the Chinese people, especially Chinese intellectuals, to fight against Japanese imperialism.

You are also an active builder of the new People's Republic of China and one of the most enthusiastic activists in consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship.

In the years after the end of World War II, when American imperialism began to prepare for a third world war, when a new and serious danger threatened the disaster-stricken mankind, when American imperialist aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique violated their faith and attacked the heroic Korean people who were fighting for their freedom and independence, and committed unprecedented atrocities in human history, the Bulgarian people gained a deeper understanding of you. It was at this time that you became a great and unyielding fighter for peace and against American imperialist aggression in Korea. The entire democratic camp and all honest people in the world will not forget your speeches in defense of peace, especially your speech at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, where you used extraordinary arguments and principles to expose American imperialism's preparations for a new world war and pointed out that American imperialism was the culprit of the atrocities in Korea. The 500 million Chinese people stand at the forefront of the great worldwide peace movement, pointing out the path of lasting peace, independence, and progress to the people of all Asia. You are one of the most prominent representatives of this great people, and you wear the medal of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" on your chest.

Because of all these reasons, because of your entire scientific, literary, social, and political activities, you have become a first-class cultural and social activist and also the most outstanding representative of the world's peace struggle. Therefore, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences declares you its honorary academician. For the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, for Bulgarian scientists, and for all the Bulgarian people, it is an honor to have such an outstanding scientific and cultural representative of the great Chinese people in their ranks.

While awarding you the certificate, I would like to express my deep gratitude and thanks to you, Academician, a world-renowned great scientist, writer, social activist, and peace fighter, on behalf of the Bulgarian cultural and scientific workers, and convey to you the great respect and love of the Bulgarian people for you. The name of Guo Moruo, in the eyes of the Bulgarian people, is inseparable from the worldwide peace movement and from the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people, after being liberated from fascist enslavement on September 9, 1944, are rapidly moving towards the path of building socialism in peaceful labor under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Bulgarian working people have victoriously completed the first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan in four years and are currently carrying out the second Five-Year Plan. Our people are fully engaged in creative peaceful labor, united around their own people's government, standing in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and doing everything possible to support the cause of peace. Our people stand at the forefront of all large-scale movements for peace. That is why the name of Guo Moruo, the great son of the great Chinese people and an outstanding world peace fighter, is also a name close to the Bulgarian people.

Awarding you the academician certificate is also an expression of the Bulgarian people's love for the Chinese people, and it also demonstrates Sino-Bulgarian friendship. Our people watch with great interest and joy the achievements made by the Chinese people in building a new life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong after being liberated from feudal and imperialist enslavement. We see in the 500 million Chinese people a powerful and indestructible force of progress, who bravely uphold the cause of peace in Asia and the world and point out the path to freedom and progress for the oppressed people. The Bulgarian people welcomed the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 with great joy and were one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the new Chinese government. Our people warmly welcome the participation of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in the war against American imperialist aggression in Korea; and celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the Chinese people and peace forces over imperialism and reactionary forces.

The friendly relations between the Chinese and Bulgarian people are being consolidated and developed day by day. We can personally experience the love of the Chinese people for the Bulgarian people. Today we can meet many Chinese scientific and cultural workers and many peasants—the advanced producers in the countryside, and visit many cities, villages, and research institutes. We are greeted with enthusiastic and heartfelt welcome everywhere. Our meetings have become warm expressions of Sino-Bulgarian friendship. We are confident that Chinese comrades are familiar with the Bulgarian people's struggle, familiar with the achievements of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and especially know, respect, and remember our late Georgi Dimitrov.

The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences electing you as an honorary academician is another new contribution to further consolidating Sino-Bulgarian friendship and strengthening the cultural cooperation between the two peoples.

Respected Academician Guo Moruo, while awarding you the certificate, please allow me to pay tribute to you on behalf of the leading institutions of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and sincerely wish you good health and longevity, and hope that you will use your great energy and potential for the progress of mankind, for the cause of peace, for the victory of justice throughout the world, and hope that you will continue to work so creatively forever.

Long live the eternal (generational) consolidation and development of Sino-Bulgarian friendship!

Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

    在保科学院授予郭沫若名誉院士学位的仪式上
    达斯卡洛夫院士致词敬爱的郭沫若院士同志：
    我现在执行着一件非常愉快的任务，就是根据保加利亚科学院语言学、人类学和文学部（研究所）的建议，在一九五二年二月三、四、十日的保加利亚科学院全体年会上选您为保加利亚科学院名誉院士；我现在把院士证书授予您。
    我们保加利亚科学院和文化界选您这一位著名的中国科学和文化界的代表为名誉院士不是偶然的，也不是寻常的事。它是一件巨大的文化事件。
    我们保加利亚认为您是中国近代的一位伟大作家，著名诗篇“女神”、“恢复”、“前茅”的作者，
  “少年时代”、“落叶”、“骑士”、“创作十年”、“反正前后”等小说的作者，动人的剧作如“屈原”“棠棣之花”和其他作品的作者，文学批评和政论文章，如“从文学革命到革命文学”及其他的作者。在您全部文学创作的年代中，您用高度的技巧严厉批判了旧的封建秩序和传统，反抗社会不平的现象，反抗帝国主义在中国的侵略行为。在您从事文学的一生中，对侵略、反动和不正义的行为进行了不妥协的反抗。您的诗是为了争取更美好的、正义的和幸福的生活而不懈斗争的战斗号召。
    除此之外，我们知道您是中国历史方面最伟大科学家之一，您对古代中国历史的研究做出卓越的贡献。特别宝贵的是您所写的历史著作：“中国古代社会研究”“奴隶制时代”，这些著作是第一次用历史唯物观点研究中国社会发展上划分年代的问题。
    我们还知道您是反对帝国主义和国民党蒋介石统治的英勇的始终不懈的战士之一。您因有进步思想和参加革命斗争，经常遭到迫害、逮捕、伤害以至于判罪。在抗日战争的年代里，您站在进步的中国文学和艺术活动家的前列，用您自己的文章、报告和热情的演讲来反对日本侵略，并动员中国人民尤其是中国知识分子为反对日本帝国主义而斗争。
    您也是新的中华人民共和国的积极建设者，是巩固中苏友好最热心的一位活动家。
    在第二次大战结束以后的几年中，当美帝国主义开始准备第三次世界大战的时候，新的严重危险威胁着受过灾难的人类的时候，当美帝国主义侵略者和李承晚匪帮违背信义进攻正在为自己自由和独立而斗争的英勇朝鲜人民，并做出了人类历史上空前兽行的时候，保加利亚人民对您有了更深刻的认识。就是在这时候，您成为保卫和平和反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的伟大和不屈的战士。整个民主阵营和全世界所有正直人们都不会忘记您的保卫和平的演讲，特别是您在华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会上的演讲，您以非凡的论证和原则性揭发美帝国主义准备新世界大战，并指出美帝国主义是朝鲜兽行的罪人。五万万中国人民站在伟大的全世界和平运动的前线，给全亚洲人民指出持久和平、独立和进步的道路。您就是这个伟大人民的最著名的一位代表，在您的胸前佩戴着“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的奖章。
    由于以上这些，由于您的全部科学的、作家的、社会的和政治的巨大活动，您就成为第一流文化和社会活动家同时也是世界和平斗争的最卓越的代表，因此保加利亚科学院宣布您是它的名誉院士。对于保加利亚科学院，对于保加利亚科学工作者，对于全保加利亚人民都因在自己行列中有伟大中国人民如此卓越的科学和文化代表而感到光荣。
    当授给您证书的同时，我要代表保加利亚文化科学工作者向您，院士同志，——全世界著名的大科学家、作家、社会活动者和和平战士，表示深厚的感激和谢意，并把保加利亚人民对您的巨大尊敬和热爱转达给您。郭沫若的名字在保加利亚人民看来，是与全世界和平运动不可分割的，是与中保人民之间的友谊不可分割的。由于苏联的帮助，保加利亚人民在一九四四年九月九日从法西斯奴役下解放以后，在共产党领导下在和平劳动中迅速地走向建设社会主义的道路。保加利亚劳动人民在四年中胜利地完成了第一个季米特洛夫五年计划，目前正进行第二个五年计划。我国人民全力投入创造性的和平劳动中，一致团结在自己人民政府的周围，站在以苏联为首的和平阵线，并尽一切力量拥护和平事业。我们人民是站在所有为和平斗争的大规模运动中的前列。这就是为什么伟大中国人民的伟大儿子，世界卓越的和平战士郭沫若的名字也就是保加利亚人民所亲近的名字。
    授给您院士证书，同时是保加利亚人民热爱中国人民的表示，也就表现了中保友好。我国人民怀着极大的兴趣和喜悦的心情注视着中国人民从封建和帝国主义奴役下解放后在中国共产党和以毛泽东主席为首的中央人民政府领导下建设新生活所获得的成就。我们从五万万中国人民身上看到强大和不可摧毁的进步力量，他们勇敢地坚持亚洲和世界的和平事业，并给被压迫的人民指出走向自由和前进的道路。保加利亚人民以巨大喜悦的心情欢迎一九四九年中华人民共和国的成立，并且是与新的中国政府建立外交关系最早的国家中的一个。我国人民以极大的热情欢迎英勇的中国人民志愿军参加在朝鲜的反对美帝国主义侵略的战争；并与中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道庆祝朝鲜停战协定的签订。朝鲜停战协定签字是中国人民和和平力量战胜帝国主义和反动势力的巨大胜利。
    中国与保加利亚人民之间的友好关系日益得到巩固和发展。我们能够亲身体验到中国人民对保加利亚人民的热爱。我们今天能够和许多中国科学和文化工作者以及许多农民——农村生产的先进者见面，能够访问了许多城市农村和研究所。我们到处受到热情和衷心的欢迎。我们的会见变成中保友好的热烈表现。我们确信中国同志很熟悉保加利亚人民的斗争、熟悉保加利亚人民共和国的成就，特别是都晓得、尊敬和追念我们故去的乔治·季米特洛夫。
    保加利亚科学院选您为名誉院士这件事，对进一步巩固中保友好和加强两国人民文化合作又是一个新的贡献。
    敬爱的郭沫若院士同志，在授给您证书的时候，请允许我代表保加利亚科学院领导机构向您致敬，并衷心地祝您身体健康、万寿无疆，希望用您巨大的精力和可能来为人类的进步，为和平事业，为全世界正义的胜利，希望您永远这样富有创造性地工作下去。
    中保友好永世（世世代代）的巩固和发展万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线万岁！
