Sichuan pickled mustard tuber is a famous specialty of Sichuan, mainly produced in Fuling County of the province. Forty-five townships in the county along the Yangtze River over a distance of more than 180 li produce pickled mustard tuber. There are more than 350,000 farmers, with an annual output of about 200,000 jars, and the highest annual output can reach 500,000 jars. In the past, due to the reactionary government's lack of attention to pickled mustard tuber production, farmers and manufacturers were extremely blind, resulting in sharp increases and decreases in production, poor quality, and high costs. As a result, sales channels were blocked, and sometimes they even had to use unsold pickled mustard tuber as fertilizer, causing great losses to both farmers and manufacturers.

In the four years since liberation, the People's Government has attached great importance to pickled mustard tuber production, issuing more than 5 billion yuan in loans to support farmers in purchasing fertilizers, pesticides, and manufacturers in purchasing equipment, solving production difficulties. At the same time, the county leadership also organized a Pickled Mustard Tuber Production Guidance Committee to specifically guide pickled mustard tuber production. Every year in August, when the seedlings are sown, a meeting of farmer representatives is held to discuss and decide on production plans, summarize and exchange production experience. In November, near the maturity period, another meeting of farmer and manufacturer representatives is held to study the cost of mustard tuber, set prices, and sign contracts, so that production and sales are balanced, prices are reasonable, and the interests of farmers are guaranteed. In order to ensure the quality and specifications of pickled mustard tuber, the county has organized a Finished Product Inspection Committee. All pickled mustard tuber for export must be inspected and qualified before being allowed to be exported. As a result, the quality of pickled mustard tuber has been improving year by year. For example, the output of special-grade pickled mustard tuber in 1952 only accounted for 43.8% of the total output, while in 1953 it increased to 93.88%. First-grade pickled mustard tuber decreased from 35.3% to 7.5%, and second-grade pickled mustard tuber decreased from 20.9% to 1.61%. At the same time, the output of pickled mustard tuber in 1953 increased by 11.88% compared to 1952. Due to the improvement of product quality, sales have greatly increased. Fuling pickled mustard tuber is distributed through Shanghai and Hankou, and is exported to Korea, Southeast Asia, and other places. Domestically, it sells well in major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and mustard tuber ears sell well throughout the country. With the development of production and the opening of sales channels, the income of farmers has also greatly increased. The annual income of farmers in the county is about 9 billion to 12 billion yuan. (Lin Pingshan)

    四川榨菜畅销国内外
    榨菜是四川著名的特产，主要产区在该省的涪陵县，全县有四十五个乡沿长江两岸一百八十多华里的地区出产榨菜，菜农三十五万多人，年产量在二十万坛左右，最高年产可达五十万坛。过去由于反动政府不重视榨菜生产，菜农和产制商带有极大的盲目性，产量骤增骤减，品质低劣，成本过高，因之销路闭塞，有时甚至只得把销不出去的榨菜沤作肥料，使菜农和产制商都受到很大损失。
    解放四年来，人民政府对榨菜生产非常重视，共计发放了五十多亿元的贷款扶持菜农购买肥料、杀虫药械及产制商添置设备等，解决了生产上的困难。同时，县的领导还组织了榨菜生产辅导委员会，专门指导榨菜生产，并在每年八月菜秧下种时，即召开菜农代表会议，讨论决定生产计划，总结交流生产经验，十一月近成熟期时，又召开菜农及产制商代表会议，研究菜头成本，制定价格，签订合同，使产销平衡，价格合理，保证了菜农的利益。为了保证榨菜的品质和规格，县里组织了成品检验委员会，凡出口榨菜，必须经检验合格才准予出口，因之，榨菜的品质已逐年提高，如特等榨菜一九五二年的产量只占总产量的百分之四十三点八，而在一九五三年则增至百分之九十三点八八，甲等榨菜则由百分之三十五点三降到百分之七点五，乙等榨菜由百分之二十点九降到一点六一。同时，榨菜的产量，一九五三年较一九五二年增加了百分之十一点八八。由于产品质量的提高，销路大开，涪陵榨菜以上海、汉口为集散地，国外销至朝鲜、南洋等地，国内畅销北京、天津等各大城市，菜耳朵则畅销全国各地。随着生产的发展和销路的开辟，菜农的收入也大大增加，每年全县菜农收入在九十亿至一百二十亿元左右。　（林屏山）
