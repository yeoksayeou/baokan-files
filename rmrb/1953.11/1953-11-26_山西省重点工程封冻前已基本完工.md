Shanxi Province's basic construction units have achieved a major victory in the production increase and economy campaign. Key civil engineering and construction projects have been basically completed before freeze-up. According to incomplete statistics from various work areas under the Third Engineering Department of the Central Second Ministry of Machine Building and the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company, Taiyuan First Construction Engineering Company, Taiyuan Second Construction Engineering Company, Taiyuan Real Estate Company, and Datong City Construction Engineering Bureau Second Work Area under the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau: As of now, 42 construction projects have been fully completed or have fully completed this year's construction progress plan, and 35 construction projects have completed external works and entered the interior finishing work phase. The state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Company, Datong Mining Bureau Engineering Company, and Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory Basic Construction Department have all completed this year's civil engineering construction tasks. The Second and Third Work Areas of the state-owned Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant Basic Construction Department have completed the external construction of civil engineering projects and entered the interior construction phase. The Sixth Engineering Department of the Central Second Ministry of Machine Building also completely completed the construction tasks of key civil engineering projects on November 15. These key civil engineering projects include many newly built and expanded factory buildings and auxiliary construction projects, many specialized technical schools for training talent for the country's industrial construction, many newly built hospitals and sanatoriums for improving people's lives, as well as many office buildings and dormitories. Therefore, the completion of these key construction projects plays a significant role in accelerating the country's socialist industrialization and improving the people's material and cultural life.
    Currently, in order to ensure the complete and victorious completion of key construction projects and prepare for next year's construction work, various construction units are taking various measures. On the one hand, they are strengthening leadership over the finishing work of projects to ensure smooth completion; on the other hand, they are actively carrying out financial settlement, summarization, and winter training preparation work.
