    The Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, led by Premier Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, arrived in our capital, Beijing, yesterday at the invitation of the Central People's Government of our country. The Chinese people, with unparalleled excitement, extend our heartfelt and warm welcome to the distinguished guests from our great neighbor. The Chinese and Korean peoples have forged an intimate, brotherly fighting friendship in the three years of jointly resisting American imperialist aggression. The visit of the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to our country will further consolidate and develop this immortal and profound friendship.
    The glorious Korean people, in the great struggle to defeat American imperialist aggression, have brilliantly proven themselves to be a very tenacious and brave nation. They have demonstrated to the world with the most brilliant and eloquent facts that no force can defeat a nation that has taken its national destiny into its own hands; even the most violent enemy like the United States will shamefully fail before them. This victory of great international significance will undoubtedly inspire the people of all colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries to strengthen their determination and confidence to defend their motherland and resist imperialist aggression, encourage all peace-loving people to strengthen their firm will to fight to defend peace, and strengthen the forces of peace. The victorious struggle of the Korean people against American aggression has not only defended the independence and democratic base of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but has also made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people have become a glorious example for peace-loving humanity and a shining banner for all oppressed nations striving for independence and freedom.
    In the great struggle to defend the honor, freedom, and independence of their motherland, all strata of the Korean people and all patriotic forces have united into a fighting whole, closely united around the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung. The Korean Workers' Party has always stood at the forefront of the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Korean people. The consolidation and development of the alliance of the working class and peasants in Korea, led by it, is the main source of the Korean people's ability to unite closely, display astonishing fighting spirit and indestructible strength in the war of resistance against American aggression.
    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have fought side by side for three years to defeat the common enemy. They have supported each other like brothers, cooperated with each other, and forged an unbreakable fighting friendship. The Korean people, educated by the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the great spirit of internationalism, have shown unparalleled enthusiasm in cherishing and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers. The heroic and tenacious fighting spirit displayed by the Korean people in the struggle to defeat American aggression and defend the independence and freedom of their motherland has not only greatly encouraged the fighting courage of the Chinese People's Volunteers, but has also profoundly educated the broad masses of the Chinese people, further enhancing their patriotism and internationalism. The Chinese people feel infinitely honored and proud to have such a friendly and great neighbor.
    The fighting friendship forged in blood by the people of China and Korea in the just war against American aggression has become a bulwark guaranteeing the security of our two countries and peace in the Far East. The just struggle of the people of China and Korea has been unanimously supported by the people of all countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has been warmly sympathized with by all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world.
    During the period when the Korean people are restoring and building the national economy destroyed by the war and stabilizing the people's lives, the Chinese people are determined to continue to deeply develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and do their best to support the Korean people until the completion of Korea's reconstruction and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of our country, said in a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: "I wish the heroic Korean people who defeated the American imperialist aggressors great achievements in the cause of striving to prevent the recurrence of aggressive war and building a peaceful, unified, and independent new Korea." Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of our country, said in a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: "The heroic Korean people will receive the active support and assistance of the entire Chinese people in the cause of restoring war wounds and the national economy and striving for the peace, unification, and independence of Korea." This expresses the deep friendship of the Chinese people's determination to always support the cause of the Korean people.
    The Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, visited the Soviet Union, the great ally of the Chinese people, in September this year. The results of the talks with the Soviet government fully demonstrated the further development and strengthening of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Korea. The Soviet government also paid special attention to the issue of assisting the Korean people in restoring the national economy. Immediately after the Korean armistice was realized, the Soviet government gratuitously allocated 1 billion rubles to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which will be used to restore and build many important peaceful industries that form the basis for the development of the Korean national economy and the improvement of people's lives. At the same time, the Soviet Union will supply Korea with equipment and materials for restoring transportation, developing agriculture, and cultural and educational welfare undertakings, as well as a large number of daily necessities for residents. This profound friendship assistance from the great Soviet Union to the Korean people plays a decisive role in healing the wounds of the Korean War. The people of the people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people around the world will actively support and assist the Korean people's efforts to rebuild a peaceful life.
    Under the fraternal assistance and encouragement of the countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and under the strong leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people are engaging in the arduous task of rebuilding a peaceful life with the high patriotic spirit demonstrated in the war. Thanks to their selfless labor, although the war has only stopped for more than three months, some reservoirs have been repaired, and some factories and mines have resumed production. All peace-loving people in the world feel extremely gratified by every achievement made by the Korean people in the great cause of restoring and building the national economy. We firmly believe that the Korean people, who demonstrated a lofty spirit of collectivism and patriotism in the war, will surely be able to further develop this fine tradition, overcome all possible difficulties and obstacles, exert great strength, and continuously achieve new and brilliant achievements in the huge task of rebuilding a peaceful life in the future.
    The destinies of the Chinese and Korean peoples are closely linked together. Let us continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, let us continue to consolidate the eternal and immortal internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, continue to strive for the full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, defeat the American aggressors' conspiracy to undermine the armistice agreement and undermine peace in Korea, and continue to strive to support the Korean people in healing the wounds of war, restoring the peaceful economy, improving the people's lives, and striving for the great work of national independence, democracy, and peaceful reunification.
    The great fighting friendship forged in blood by the people of China and Korea is forever unbreakable. Let us warmly congratulate the continued consolidation and development of the great friendship between the two peoples, and let us warmly congratulate the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on its great success in its visit to our country.

    欢迎金日成元帅和朝鲜政府代表团
    应我国中央人民政府邀请来我国访问的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，在朝鲜人民领袖内阁首相金日成元帅的率领下，已于昨日抵达我国首都北京。中国人民以无比兴奋的心情，对于我们伟大邻国的贵宾们的莅临，衷心地表示热烈的欢迎。中朝两国人民在共同抵抗美帝国主义侵略的三年来，已经结成了亲密无间的兄弟般的战斗友谊；朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团的访问我国，必将进一步巩固和发展这种不朽的深厚的友谊。
    光荣的朝鲜人民，在打败美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争中，出色地证明了自己是一个非常刚毅和勇敢的民族。它以最光辉、最雄辩的事实向全世界证明：一个已经把国家的命运掌握在自己手里的民族，是没有任何一种力量可以战胜它的；即使像美国这样最强暴的敌人，也会在它的面前可耻地失败下去。这个具有重大国际意义的胜利，无疑地，将鼓舞一切殖民地半殖民地和附属国的人民为保卫祖国反抗帝国主义侵略的决心和信心，鼓舞一切爱好和平的人民为保卫和平而斗争的坚决意志，增强和平的力量。朝鲜人民抵抗美国侵略的胜利斗争，不仅捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和民主的基地，而且对于保卫远东和世界和平事业做了伟大的贡献。朝鲜人民已经成为爱好和平人类的光荣榜样，已经成为一切被压迫国家人民争取独立自由的光辉旗帜。
    在保卫祖国的荣誉、自由和独立的伟大斗争中，朝鲜的各阶层人民和一切爱国力量，已经团结成一个战斗的整体，紧密地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的周围。朝鲜劳动党在朝鲜人民争取祖国自由和独立的斗争中，始终站在斗争的最前列。它所领导的朝鲜工人阶级和农民的联盟的巩固和发展，是朝鲜人民在抵抗美国侵略的战争中，能够紧密地团结一致，发挥出惊人的战斗精神和不可摧毁的力量的主要源泉。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为了打败共同的敌人而并肩战斗了三年，他们兄弟般地相互支援，协同配合，结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以国际主义的伟大精神教育下的朝鲜人民，以无比的热情爱护和支援我国人民志愿军。朝鲜人民在打败美国侵略保卫自己祖国独立自由的斗争中所表现的英勇坚强的战斗精神，不仅大大鼓舞了我国人民志愿军战斗的勇气，并且深刻地教育了我国的广大人民，更加提高了我国人民的爱国主义和国际主义思想。中国人民深深以有这样友好而伟大的邻邦而感到无限的光荣和骄傲。
    朝中两国人民在反对美国侵略的正义战争中，用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊，已经成为保障我们两国安全和远东和平的堡垒。朝中两国人民的正义斗争受到以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国人民的一致支援，并且得到世界上一切爱好和平自由的人民的热烈同情。
    在朝鲜人民恢复和建设被战争破坏的国民经济、安定人民生活的时期，中国人民决心继续深入开展抗美援朝运动，尽力支援朝鲜人民，直到朝鲜重建工作的完成和朝鲜问题和平解决为止。在朝鲜解放八周年纪念的时候，我国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志在致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金柈奉同志的贺电中说：“祝战胜了美国帝国主义侵略者的英雄的朝鲜人民，在努力防止侵略战争之再起和建立和平、统一、独立的新朝鲜的事业中获得伟大的成就。”我国政务院总理周恩来同志在致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成同志的贺电中说：“英雄的朝鲜人民在恢复战争创伤和国民经济及争取朝鲜的和平、统一与独立的事业中，将得到全中国人民的积极支持和帮助。”这表达了中国人民决心永远支持朝鲜人民事业的深刻的友情。
    以金日成同志为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，今年九月间访问了中国人民的伟大盟邦苏联，与苏联政府举行会谈的结果，充分显示了苏朝两国间友好合作的进一步的发展和加强。苏联政府并特别注意了援助朝鲜人民恢复国民经济的问题。苏联政府在朝鲜停战实现后，立即无代价地拨给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的十亿卢布，将用于恢复和建筑许多作为朝鲜发展国民经济和提高人民生活的基础的重要和平工业；同时苏联将供给朝鲜用于恢复交通、发展农业和文教福利事业的设备和器材，以及大量的居民日用必需品。伟大的苏联对朝鲜人民的这种深厚友谊的援助，对于医治朝鲜战争创伤有着决定性的作用。各人民民主国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民，都将对朝鲜人民重建和平生活的努力，给以积极的支持和援助。
    在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国兄弟般的援助和鼓舞下、在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下的朝鲜人民，正以在战争中所表现的高度爱国主义的精神来从事重建和平生活的艰巨工作。由于他们忘我的劳动，虽然战争刚刚停止三个多月，却已经有一些蓄水池修复了，一些工厂和矿山恢复生产了。各国爱好和平的人民，对于朝鲜人民在恢复和建设国民经济这一伟大事业中所取得的每一个成绩，都感到极大的欣慰。我们深信，在战争中表现了崇高的集体主义和爱国主义精神的朝鲜人民，今后在重建和平生活的巨大工作中，一定能够进一步发扬这种优良传统，克服一切可能遭遇到的困难和障碍，发挥巨大的力量，不断地获得新的光辉的成绩。
    中国人民和朝鲜人民的命运已经紧密地连结在一起了。让我们继续加强抗美援朝的工作，让我们继续巩固中朝人民间的永远不朽的国际主义的友谊，继续努力争取朝鲜停战协定的全部实现和朝鲜问题的和平解决，打败美国侵略者破坏停战协定、破坏朝鲜和平的阴谋，继续努力支持朝鲜人民医治战争创伤、恢复和平经济、改善人民生活并争取祖国独立民主和平统一的巨大工作。
    中朝人民用鲜血结成的伟大战斗的友谊，是永远牢不可破的。让我们热烈地祝贺两国人民伟大友谊的继续巩固和发展，让我们热烈地祝贺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团在我国访问中获得巨大的成功。
