    Further Incorporate Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises into the Track of State Capitalism
    Our general line for the transition period stipulates that, over a considerable period, we must gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. To gradually realize the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, we must gradually change the existing relations of production and management methods of private industry and commerce.
    Currently, our country's economic construction is advancing rapidly, and all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are also showing unprecedented prosperity. However, the anarchic state of production and operation and the unreasonable state of labor-capital relations in private industry and commerce cannot meet the growing needs of the country and the people. Therefore, the state must gradually realize the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, gradually change their original relations of production and management methods, and promote them to further accept the direct leadership of the socialist economy, so that they can adapt to the country's construction plans and the needs of the people.
    Under the conditions in our country, to transform capitalist private industrial and commercial enterprises into socialist enterprises, we must first encourage capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises to develop in the direction of state capitalism. State capitalism is an economic alliance of socialist and capitalist components under the direct leadership of the socialist economy; state capitalist enterprises are capitalistenterprises managed by the people's government, connected and cooperated with state-owned socialist economy in various ways, and supervised by the working class. State capitalist economy is not yet a socialist economy, but it is no longer a general private capitalist economy, but a transitional form of economy. On the one hand, it has not yet abolished capitalist private ownership, but only restricts this ownership to varying degrees; on the other hand, socialist components are more closely connected or cooperated with it to varying degrees, and will gradually strengthen the role and proportion of these socialist components in the process of development.
    Judging from the situation in the first three years of our country's transition period, various specific forms of state capitalist economy have emerged. In industry, according to the degree of their connection or cooperation with the socialist economy, they can be divided into the advanced form of joint state-private ownership, the intermediate form of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, and the low-level forms of purchase and sales. In commerce, there are forms such as joint state-private ownership, consignment sales, and purchasing from the state and selling at prices stipulated by the state. These state capitalist economies have seen some development in the past four years. Joint state-private industrial enterprises accounted for 3% of the total output value of state-private industry in 1951 and 5% in 1952. Enterprises engaged in processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales for the state have increased even more. Taking Shanghai as an example, the total amount of processing and ordering accounted for 32% of the total private industrial business volume in 1950, 44% in 1951, and 58% in 1952, and has increased even more this year. Past facts have proved that all forms of state capitalist enterprises are superior to general private capitalist enterprises, and advanced forms of state capitalist enterprises are superior to low-level forms of state capitalist enterprises. All relatively developed forms of state capitalist enterprises have shown many advantages.
    First, these enterprises have to varying degrees the conditions to adapt to the state's planned construction, so it is possible to gradually incorporate them into the track of the state plan. After nearly 60 enterprises in Shanghai were jointly owned by the state and private sector, the production direction was determined and production was incorporated into the track of the state plan. For example, the East China Steel Construction Factory, which started joint state-private ownership this year, was originally a Baofu Kee cold-working factory with all kinds of "evils." In the past, this factory caused many losses to the state when contracting projects such as the Huaihe gate. After the joint state-private ownership, the state sent cadres to participate in management, and added many workers and equipment. It has now become a professional steel construction team under the unified deployment of the state, and this year it has undertaken the construction tasks of factory buildings for key construction units such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. After 6,230 private factories in Shanghai (as of the end of July) accepted state processing and ordering, the state planned to help them solve difficulties such as funds and raw materials, and made their production avoid blindness. Many light industrial factories have improved the variety, quality, and designs of their products according to the changes in people's needs. The products no longer flow to the free market, but are supplied by the state to the needs of people all over the country in a planned way.
    Second, all relatively developed forms of state capitalist enterprises, because their production and operation are for the needs of the state, or mainly for the needs of the state; and because the profits of the enterprises are rationally distributed in four aspects: state income tax, worker welfare bonuses, enterprise public accumulation fund, and capitalist dividends (including the remuneration of capitalist agents), this changes the past profit-seeking situation of capitalist enterprises, so it is possible to improve labor-capital relations, and both labor and capital can work together to improve the production and operation of the enterprise. In the Tianyuan and Tianli Electroplating Factories in Shanghai, which are jointly owned by the state and private sector, the unit output of the main products has been increasing year by year due to the employees' efforts to unleash their production potential, and in April this year it increased to more than two or three times that before liberation. More than 160 iron factories in Shenyang that accept state processing and ordering have employees who actively work in the competition, with attendance rates of over 95%, and the capitalists' enthusiasm for management has also increased. Since the Shenyang horseshoe industry accepted state processing and ordering, the capitalists of each factory have invited technical personnel to organize technical research meetings and sent people to the Shanghai horseshoe factory to study, so that the product quality has been improved to mostly meet the specifications required by the state.
    Third, under the conditions of improved state-private relations and labor-capital relations, and the gradual improvement of the enterprise's production, operation, and management, some enterprises can also be reconstructed or expanded. In the year since the Nanjing Soda Factory implemented joint state-private ownership, the state's investment in capital construction has been equal to 18 times the total amount of construction in the four years after the factory's liberation. Compared with 1949, the current situation of the Huaxin Textile Factory in Tangshan, which is jointly owned by the state and private sector, shows that the number of workers has increased by half, the number of spindles has increased by 20,000, and the number of looms has increased by more than 480. In the Shanghai Zhongxi Pharmacy, which mainly engaged in the buying and selling of domestic and foreign prepared medicines in the past, more than 100 kinds of deceptive and expired medicines were destroyed after joint state-private ownership, and a pharmaceutical factory was newly built, transforming it from a commercial enterprise to an enterprise mainly engaged in drug manufacturing.
    Fourth, since the production and operation of these enterprises have improved and expanded, the enterprises have reasonable profits to make, capitalists have reasonable profits to obtain, the living welfare of capitalist agents is appropriately guaranteed, and the living standards of employees are gradually improved. With the development of production in the Huaxin Textile Factory in Tangshan, which is jointly owned by the state and private sector (taking the factory's output in 1949 as 100, the output of cotton yarn in 1952 was 218.6, and the output of cotton cloth reached 229.7), the reasonable profits obtained by the enterprise have also increased year by year, from more than 4.2 billion yuan in 1949 to 66.7 billion yuan in 1952; the income of the capitalists has also increased, with shareholder dividends of 10.4 billion yuan in 1951 and 14.4 billion yuan in 1952; part of it was used to improve the living welfare of employees, and part of it was used to expand reproduction (the second cotton spinning mill with 20,000 new spindles has been put into production). Employees' wages have also increased: the average wage per person was 465,500 yuan per month in 1950, and the average wage has increased to 548,000 yuan per month this year.
    Fifth, within these enterprises, capitalists and capitalist agents have obtained ample opportunities to contribute and develop their management and technical talents. Under the leadership of public shareholder representatives, the status and role of private shareholder representatives have been respected. In the Minsheng Shipping Company, which is jointly owned by the state and private sector, there were directors who had been "non-directors" for more than 20 years, and now they also participate in the actual management of the company; many private shareholder representatives feel that in the past, the power of the company was actually held by a few people, and now they really have positions and powers, and have things to do. Some enterprises that have accepted state processing and ordering can concentrate on improving the operation and management of the enterprise because the state has helped solve difficulties such as funds and raw materials.
    In general, all forms of state capitalist enterprises, under the direct leadership of the state-owned economy, have changed their relations of production and management methods, gradually developed their productivity, and benefited the state, workers, and capitalists. This form of state capitalism will facilitate the smooth and complete transformation of capitalist ownership into socialist ownership in the future, and is in line with the requirements of the state's general line for the transition period.
    Further incorporating capitalist industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism is fully necessary and fully possible today. The development of economic construction and the increasing demand for the planning of the national economy, the great political and economic advantages of the working class and the state-owned economy, the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people with capitalism and their longing for socialism, private industrialists and merchants have undergone varying degrees of transformation in past social reforms, and a group of advanced elements have emerged, and both the public and private sectors have accumulated some experience in state capitalism. These favorable conditions will promote the extensive development of the state capitalist economy in the future.
    Of course, the development of the state capitalist economy must be carried out step by step, in a planned way, and with distinctions, based on the needs and possibilities of the state. There are still many specific issues that need to be further studied and resolved. The relevant departments of the government and the state-owned economic institutions in various localities should fully recognize the great importance of incorporating private industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism, adopt a positive attitude, and strive to promote its development. All patriotic private industrialists and merchants should also fully recognize that taking the road of state capitalism is not only the general trend and the aspiration of the people, but also enables them to obtain benefits today, have appropriate jobs to do in the future, and enjoy a happy life in a socialist society together with the people of the whole country. Therefore, for the sake of the public and the private, for today and for the future, they should all support the policy of incorporating private industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism with practical actions. This is the specific task of patriotic industrialists and merchants to realize the country's general line, and it is also the specific manifestation of their patriotism.

    进一步把私营工商业纳入国家资本主义的轨道
    我国过渡时期的总路线规定了我国在一个相当长的时期内，必须逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，必须逐步实现国家对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造。而要逐步实现对私营工商业的社会主义改造就必须把私营工商业现有的生产关系和经营方法逐步加以改变。
    现在，我们国家的经济建设正在一日千里地前进，一切有利于国计民生的私营工商业也表现了前所未有的繁荣。但是，私营工商业现有的生产和经营的无政府状态及劳资关系的不合理状态是不能适应国家和人民日益增长的需要的。因此，国家就必须逐步实现对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，逐步改变它们原有的生产关系和经营方法，促使它们进一步接受社会主义经济的直接领导，使它们能够适合于国家的建设计划和人民的需要。
    在我国的条件下，要把资本主义的私营工商业改变成为社会主义的企业，必须首先鼓励资本主义工商业向国家资本主义的方向发展。国家资本主义是在社会主义经济直接领导下的社会主义成分和资本主义成分的经济联盟；国家资本主义企业也就是在人民政府管理下的，用各种方式和国营社会主义经济联系和合作的、受工人阶级监督的资本主义企业。国家资本主义经济，还不是社会主义经济，但也已不是一般的私人资本主义经济，而是一种过渡形态的经济了。这就是一方面，它还没有取消资本主义的私有制，而只是给这种所有制以不同程度的限制；另方面，则有社会主义成分在不同程度上与之比较密切地联系或合作，并将在发展过程中逐渐加强这种社会主义成分的作用和比重。
    从我国过渡时期的头三年的情况来看，国家资本主义经济已出现了多种具体形式。在工业方面，按照它们和社会主义经济相联系或合作的程度，可以区分为高级形式的公私合营，中级形式的加工、订货、统购、包销，低级形式的收购、经销。在商业方面，有公私合营、代销、从国家批购并按国家规定价格出售等形式。这些国家资本主义经济在过去四年中已有了某些发展。工业方面的公私合营企业，在全国公私工业的总产值中，一九五一年占百分之三，一九五二年已占到百分之五。为国家加工、订货、统购、包销的企业则有了更多的增加。以上海为例，一九五○年加工、订货总额占私营工业总营额百分之三二，一九五一年占百分之四四，一九五二年占百分之五八，今年更加增多。过去的事实证明，一切形式的国家资本主义企业都优于一般私人资本主义企业，而高级形式的国家资本主义企业又优于低级形式的国家资本主义企业。一切比较发展了的国家资本主义形式的企业已经表现出有许多优点。
    一、这些企业在不同程度上有了适应国家计划建设的条件，因此就有可能使其逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。上海市将近六十家企业公私合营后，由于确定了生产方向，生产纳入了国家计划的轨道。如今年开始公私合营的华东钢铁建筑厂，原是一家“五毒”俱全的包福记冷作厂，这个厂过去在承包淮河闸门等工程中曾使国家遭受很多损失。公私合营后，国家派干部参加管理，增添了很多工人和设备，现已成为国家统一调配的一支专业的钢铁建筑队伍，今年已担负了第一汽车制造厂和太原重型机器厂等重点建设单位的厂房构造任务了。上海市六千二百三十家（到七月底为止）私营工厂接受了国家加工订货后，国家有计划地帮助它们解决了资金、原料等困难，并使它们的生产避免了盲目性。许多轻工业工厂，根据人民需要的变化，改进了产品的品种、质量和花色，产品不再流向自由市场，而由国家有计划地供应全国各地人民的需要。
    二、一切比较发展了的国家资本主义形式的企业，由于它的生产和经营是为了国家的需要，或主要是为了国家的需要；又由于企业的利润是按照国家所得税、工人福利奖金、企业公积金及资本家的股息红利（包括资方代理人的酬劳在内）等四个方面合理分配，这就改变了资本主义企业过去那种唯利是图的情况，因此就有可能改善劳资关系，劳资双方就有可能合力改进企业的生产和经营。上海市公私合营的天原、天利电化厂，由于职工发挥了生产潜力，主要产品的单位产量已逐年提高，今年四月比解放前提高到二倍或三倍以上。沈阳市接受国家加工订货的一百六十多家铁工厂职工，在竞赛中积极劳动，出勤率都在百分之九十五以上，资本家的经营情绪也都提高了。沈阳马铁业自接受了国家的加工订货后，各厂资方曾邀请技术人材组织技术研究会，并派人到上海马铁厂学习，使产品质量提高到大部分合乎国家需要的规格标准。
    三、在公私关系和劳资关系改善，企业的生产、经营和管理逐步改进的条件下，一部分企业还可以进行改建或扩建。南京市錏厂实行公私合营的一年来，国家投入基本建设的资金等于该厂解放后四年来的建设总额的十八倍。唐山市公私合营的华新纺织厂目前情况，和一九四九年比较，工人增加了一倍半，纱锭增加了两万枚，布机增加了四百八十多台。上海市中西大药房，过去主要是经营国内外成药买卖，公私合营后，就销毁了一百多种欺骗性的失效药品，并新建了制药工厂，由商业性的企业转变为主要进行药品制造的企业。
    四、这些企业的生产和经营既然改善并且扩大，就使企业有合理的利润可图，资本家有合理的利润可得，资本家代理人的生活福利得到适当的保障，职工生活逐步提高。唐山市公私合营的华新纺织厂，随着生产的发展（以该厂一九四九年产量为一百，一九五二年棉纱产量为二百一十八点六，棉布产量达到二百二十九点七），企业获得的合理利润也逐年增加，一九四九年为四十二亿多元，一九五二年为六百六十七亿元；资方所得也有了增加，一九五一年股东红利为一百零四亿元，一九五二年达到一百四十四亿元；其中一部分用来改善职工生活福利，同时用一部分扩大了再生产（新建立两万枚纱锭的第二座棉纺厂，已投入生产）。职工工资也有所提高：一九五○年每人平均工资为每月四十六万五千五百元，今年平均工资增加到每月五十四万八千元。
    五、在这些企业内，资本家和资本家代理人都获得了充分贡献和发展其经营管理才能或技术的机会。在公股代表领导下，私股代表的地位和作用受到了尊重。公私合营的民生轮船公司，私股代表中有当了二十多年“不董事”的董事，现在也参与了公司实际管理的工作；许多私股代表都感到过去公司里的大权实际上只由少数人把持，现在才真正有职有权，有事可做了。有些接受了国家加工订货的企业，由于国家帮助解决了资金、原料等困难，也就可以专心改善企业的经营管理了。
    总的说来，一切形式的国家资本主义企业，在国营经济直接领导下，生产关系和经营方法有所改变，生产力逐渐发展，对国家、对工人、对资本家都有好处。这种国家资本主义的形式，将有利于将来顺利地把资本主义所有制最后完全改变为社会主义所有制，符合于国家过渡时期总路线的要求。
    把资本主义工商业进一步纳入国家资本主义的轨道，在今天具有充分的必要性，也具有充分的可能性。经济建设的发展对于国民经济计划化的日益增长的要求，工人阶级和国营经济在政治上和经济上的巨大优势，广大人民对于资本主义的不满和对于社会主义的热望，私营工商业者在过去各项社会改革中有了不同程度的改造，并且出现了一批先进分子，公私各方面关于国家资本主义都已积累了一些经验，这些有利的条件都会促进国家资本主义经济在今后广大的发展。
    当然，国家资本主义经济的发展必须根据国家的需要和可能，有步骤、有计划、有区别地进行。其中也还有很多具体问题，有待进一步研究解决。政府各有关部门和各地方国营经济机构应当充分认识把私营工商业纳入国家资本主义轨道的极大重要性，采取积极态度，努力促其发展。一切爱国的私营工商业者也应当充分认识，走国家资本主义的道路，不但是大势所趋，人心所向，并且使他们因而在今天有利可得，在将来也有适当工作可做，可以和全国人民一道享受社会主义社会中的幸福生活。因此，为公为私，为今天为将来，他们都应当用实际行动拥护把私营工商业纳入国家资本主义轨道的政策。这是爱国的工商业者对于实现国家总路线的具体任务，也是他们的爱国主义的具体表现。
