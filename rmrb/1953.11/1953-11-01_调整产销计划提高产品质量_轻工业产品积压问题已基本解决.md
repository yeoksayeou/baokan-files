    Adjusting Production and Sales Plans to Improve Product Quality
    The Problem of Overstocked Light Industrial Products Has Been Largely Solved
    After the Ministry of Light Industry and relevant commercial departments studied and adjusted the production and sales plans and strived to improve product quality, the problem of overstocked light industrial products has been largely solved.
    Before July this year, state-owned factories under the Ministry of Light Industry had a serious backlog of products. The total value of major products such as tires, paper, pulp, medicine, sugar, soap, and weights and measures that were overstocked or expected to be overstocked reached more than one trillion yuan. The product backlog had caused some factories to have no place to store products, no money to buy raw materials, increased product costs, reduced profit submissions, and insufficient factory operation, resulting in a surplus of labor.
    The reasons for the backlog of light industrial products are as follows: First, the industrial production plan and the commercial procurement plan were not closely coordinated. The sales plans of commercial departments for many products were lower than the production plans of industrial departments. For example, before July, the amount of sugar purchased by the China General Merchandise Company accounted for only 60% of the factory output; the amount of soap purchased accounted for only 23.13% of the factory output. The China National Pharmaceutical Company only partially purchased the products of state-owned pharmaceutical factories, resulting in a backlog of factory products. In fact, the products were not truly surplus, but the allocation between regions was uneven. While products were overstocked, there was also a shortage of goods. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the industrial and commercial departments in Shanghai had a backlog of penicillin, while some areas in the Northeast and Northwest regions were out of penicillin for one or two months. Another example is that the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the China General Merchandise Company reduced the purchase of soap from the Shanghai State-owned Soap Factory, but the secondary wholesale stations of the China General Merchandise Company in Changsha, Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou and other places directly purchased from the Shanghai State-owned Soap Factory.
    Second, the quality of some products was poor, and the specifications were not suitable, so they were not welcomed by the masses. Some products that were originally popular in the market also lost their reputation due to poor quality. For example, the Red Flag brand car tires produced by the Northeast Rubber Factory were difficult to sell due to poor quality, resulting in a backlog. Another example is Lux soap, which was originally a popular brand, but due to the factory leaders' lack of attention to quality, the quality seriously declined, and the masses were unwilling to buy it. The China General Merchandise Company originally sold Lux soap exclusively, but by March of this year, it stopped purchasing from the factory due to the difficulty in selling the backlog.
    Third, the cost of some products was high, and the prices were expensive, so the masses could not afford to buy them. For example, many medicines were already very expensive in the cities, and they were even more shockingly expensive in the countryside. For example, sulfa anti-inflammatory tablets cost about 200 yuan per tablet in Beijing, but they cost more than 2,000 yuan per tablet in the rural areas of the Northeast.
    In addition, the backlog of some products was due to the seasonality of sales. For example, the sugar production season is from November to May of the following year, while the peak sales season is in the autumn of each year. Another example is that Bellergal and DDT in medicine are produced in all seasons, but the sales season is in summer and autumn, so appropriate reserves are needed.
    After discovering the seriousness of the backlog problem, the Ministry of Light Industry immediately appointed special personnel to study the causes of the product backlog and propose solutions to the product backlog. In the past few months, the Ministry of Light Industry and the commercial departments have further improved their work and taken some appropriate measures, and the backlog problem has been basically solved. Except for weights and measures, all of the above products are no longer overstocked. The main measures are: First, the Ministry of Light Industry and relevant commercial departments studied and adjusted the production and sales plans. For some products that are indeed needed by the market, it was suggested that the commercial departments purchase them; for some products that are indeed not needed by the market, the industrial departments adjusted the production plans. Sugar, soap, medicine and other products have been entirely purchased by commercial departments; tires, paper and other products have also seen increased purchases by commercial departments.
    The Ministry of Light Industry has repeatedly instructed factories to strive to improve quality and adjust specifications so that product quality is excellent and specifications meet market needs. The State-owned China Soap Company stopped production of Lux soap from early May to mid-July due to poor quality and stagnant sales, and mobilized workers and technicians to study and improve the quality of Lux soap. In the research process, they conducted physical performance tests on more than 30 different soap formulas that could be collected on the market, compared their advantages and disadvantages, and trial-produced new products with eight formulas, and finally improved the quality of Lux soap. As a result, it has regained credibility among the masses. In terms of specifications, we try our best to meet the requirements of the demanding departments. For example, the specifications of tires produced by state-owned rubber factories have been repeatedly adjusted. In the second quarter, the demanding departments needed more large specifications and fewer small specifications, while the production departments tried their best to increase the production of large specifications and reduce the production of small specifications. By the third quarter, the demanding departments needed more small specifications and fewer large specifications, and the production departments tried their best to increase the production of small specifications.
    Second, both industrial and commercial departments have appropriately lowered product prices. For example, the ex-factory price of medicines was higher than the commercial list price. In order to take care of the operating losses of the commercial departments, the industrial departments reduced the list price of profitable medicines by 13.5%, so that the commercial departments would not lose money; in order to take care of the production losses of some products of the industrial departments, the commercial departments purchased them at 5% below the list price (the actual cost requires 8.5%), so that the industrial departments reduced losses. Another example is that the price of paper was high, and the industrial and commercial departments reduced the industrial price and commercial list price of various papers by an average of about 5% on August 1. After the price reduction, sales increased. The commercial departments have purchased more than 20,000 tons of paper stored in the factory. In addition, the price of some products with poor quality has been reduced for sale. (Wang Baolin)

    调整产销计划提高产品质量
    轻工业产品积压问题已基本解决
    中央轻工业部与有关商业部门研究调整了产销计划，并努力提高产品质量后，轻工业产品积压问题已基本解决。
    中央轻工业部所属国营工厂在今年七月份以前，曾存在严重的积压情况，仅轮胎、纸张、纸浆、医药、食糖、肥皂、度量衡等主要产品积压或预计积压的总值达一万余亿。产品积压曾使某些工厂无处堆存产品，无钱购买原料，产品成本提高，上缴任务降低，工厂开工不足，劳动力有剩余。
    轻工业产品所以会产生积压情况，有以下原因：首先是工业生产计划与商业收购计划配合不紧密。商业部门许多产品销售计划低于工业部门生产计划。如在七月份以前，中国百货公司收购食糖数量只及工厂产量的百分之六○；收购肥皂数量只占工厂产量的百分之二十三点一三；中国医药公司对于国营药厂的产品仅部分收购，以致造成了工厂产品积压。但实际上，产品并非真正过剩，而是地区之间调拨不均匀，在产品积压的同时，却又存在商品脱销现象。如今年第一季度，上海的工业部门与商业部门的青霉素均有积压，但东北、西北某些地区则脱销青霉素达一两个月。又如中国百货公司上海采购站对上海国营肥皂厂肥皂减少收购，但长沙、天津、青岛、福州等地中国百货公司二级批发站又直接到上海国营肥皂厂采购。
    其次，某些产品的质量不好，规格不合，不为群众所喜购乐用，某些本来在市场畅销的产品，亦因质量低劣而丧失了信誉。如东北橡胶厂出产的红旗牌汽车轮胎，因质量不好，致积压难销。又如力士香皂，本来是畅销的名牌货，但由于工厂领导上不重视质量，以致质量严重下降，群众不愿购买。中国百货公司原包销力士香皂，但至今年三月，则因积压难销，而停止对工厂的收购。
    再次，某些产品成本高，价格贵，群众无力购买。如很多药品在城市中已经很贵，到了农村后，更贵得惊人，如磺胺类消炎片在北京约二百元一片，到了东北农村则要二千多元一片。
    此外，有些产品积压，是因销售有季节性的缘故。如食糖生产季节是在每年十一月份至次年五月，而旺销则在每年秋季。又如医药中的百乐君、滴滴涕，四季均要生产，但销售季节则在夏秋两季，故需适当储备。
    中央轻工业部在发现了积压问题的严重性后，即指派专人研究产品积压的原因，提出解决产品积压的办法。几个月来，中央轻工业部和商业部门都进一步改进了工作，采取了一些适当措施，积压问题已基本解决。上述诸种产品除度量衡外，均已无积压。主要措施是：首先，轻工业部与有关商业部门研究调整产销计划，某些确为市场需要的产品，建议由商业部门收购；某些确为市场不需要的产品，则由工业部门调整生产计划。食糖、肥皂、医药等产品已由商业部门全部包销；轮胎、纸张等产品亦由商业部门增加收购量。
    轻工业部曾一再指示各厂努力提高质量，调整规格，使产品质量优良，规格适合市场需要。国营中国肥皂公司因力士香皂质量不好，销路停滞，便于五月初至七月中旬停止出产，发动工人与技术人员研究改进力士香皂质量。在研究过程中，他们曾将市场上能搜集到的三十几种不同配方的肥皂作物理性能试验，比较其优劣，并以八个配料试制新产品，而终于改进了力士香皂的质量。因此又在群众中获得了信誉。在规格方面，则尽力满足需用部门的要求，如国营橡胶厂所产轮胎规格曾一再调整，第二季度需用部门要大规格者多，小规格者少，生产部门则尽力增产大规格，减产小规格。到第三季度时，需用部门又要小规格者多，大规格者少，生产部门便又尽力增产小规格。
    再次，是工、商部门均适当降低了产品价格。如医药出厂价格曾较商业牌价为高。工业部门为照顾商业部门的经营亏损，将生产有利润的药品牌价降低了百分之一三点五，使商业部门不亏本；商业部门为照顾工业部门某些产品生产的亏损，照牌价低了百分之五包购了（实际各项费用就需百分之八点五），使工业部门减少了亏损。又如纸张价格较高，工、商部门即于八月一日将各种纸张的工业价格与商业牌价平均降低约百分之五。降价后销路即有所增加。工厂积存之二万多吨纸已由商业部门加以收购。此外，对某些质量低劣的产品，则降低价格出售。（王保林）
