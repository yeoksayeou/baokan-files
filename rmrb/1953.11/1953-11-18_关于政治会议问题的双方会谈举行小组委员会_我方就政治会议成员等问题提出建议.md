Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 17th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue issued the following communiqué:

On November 17th, the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue began with two subcommittees meeting separately to discuss the issues of the Political Conference's members and location, and the issue of the Political Conference's timing.

In the subcommittee discussing members and location, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke first, putting forward specific suggestions from our side regarding the form and members of the Political Conference. Mr. Ki Sok-bok stated: "After nineteen days of discussion, both sides have reached an agreement on the agenda and discussion methods, and now we are beginning substantive discussions on the issue of the Political Conference's members and location. In order to properly resolve the issues of the Political Conference's form, members, and the participation of neutral nations, we propose the following suggestions:

	I. The Political Conference may take the form of a bilateral and equal meeting. The participating countries on both sides should be decided by each side and notified to the other.

	II. All decisions of the Political Conference must be reached with the unanimous agreement of both sides.

	III. However, to ensure the smooth progress of the Political Conference, the conference must have the participation of five other relevant neutral nations – the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma.

According to the above plan, the members of the Korean Political Conference should be the countries participating on both sides and the five neutral nations.

Regarding the issue of the location of the Political Conference, Mr. Ki Sok-bok pointed out: Since the Political Conference will take the form of a bilateral and equal meeting with the participation of neutral nations, Panmunjom is an appropriate location for the conference. Next, Mr. Huang Hua, the representative of the People's Republic of China, spoke, expressing full agreement and support for our side's suggestions regarding the form and members of the conference proposed by Mr. Ki Sok-bok. Mr. Huang Hua emphasized that our side has always believed that the Political Conference should have the participation of relevant neutral nations in addition to both sides, and should take the form of a round table meeting, because this form is most conducive to the harmonious role of neutral nations; we also maintain that, under the form of a round table meeting, the Political Conference should maintain the essence of bilateral equality, that is, all decisions of the Political Conference must be reached with the unanimous agreement of the belligerent parties to be valid. Since the other side opposes the form of a round table meeting, our side suggests that the Political Conference take the form of a bilateral and equal meeting. However, the form of a bilateral and equal meeting must not exclude the participation of relevant neutral nations in the Political Conference; on the contrary, precisely because this form is adopted, there should be a third party to participate in the Political Conference to play a harmonious role.

Mr. Huang Hua pointed out that the Soviet Union is not only a neutral nation, but has also consistently advocated and worked hard to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and therefore should participate in the Political Conference with the consent of both sides. As for the other relevant Asian neutral nations, not only is their own security directly threatened by the Korean War, so they have a close relationship with the settlement of the Korean issue, but they have also made significant efforts to promote the Korean armistice. Therefore, the participation of relevant Asian neutral nations in the Political Conference will surely play an active role. The other side's opposition to these countries' participation is an insult to all Asian countries and peoples.

Mr. Huang Hua finally pointed out that the U.S. representative, at the representative meeting on the 16th, violated the agreement between the two sides on the method of discussion by directly entering into substantive discussions before the subcommittee was formed, and carrying out distorted propaganda outside the meeting, which is very inappropriate.

In his speech, U.S. representative Dean still substantially refused the participation of neutral nations in the Political Conference. He adopted a delaying tactic, proposing a so-called suggestion that neutral nations be invited to participate only when the discussion develops to a certain stage after the Political Conference is convened. The representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea immediately refuted this, pointing out that the other side's so-called suggestion is nothing more than a means to cover up the other side's refusal of neutral nations to participate in the Political Conference.

In the subcommittee discussing the timing issue, our side spoke first, suggesting that the Political Conference should first be determined to be held within December of this year. As for specifically determining which day in December to convene, it is not very important. Because the agreement on any agenda item must become a final agreement only when all other items have been agreed upon, whether the Political Conference can start early depends on the rapid agreement on the five items; otherwise, even if a date is stipulated, it will inevitably fail. Therefore, our side suggests that it should first be determined to be held within December, and a specific date should be decided when there is a possibility of reaching an agreement on the issues of members and location. The other side spoke, advocating that a specific date be immediately determined in mid-December.

The above two subcommittees will continue to meet on the 18th.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行小组委员会
    我方就政治会议成员等问题提出建议
    【新华社开城十七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月十七日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈开始分两个小组委员会开会，分别讨论政治会议的成员与地点问题及政治会议的时间问题。
    在讨论成员与地点问题的小组委员会中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生首先发言，提出了我方关于政治会议的形式和成员问题的具体建议。奇石福先生称：“双方经过了十九天的讨论，已经取得了关于议程与讨论方法的协议，现在开始对政治会议的成员与地点问题的实质讨论。为了使政治会议的形式、成员和中立国参加的问题得到适当的解决，我们提出下列建议。
    一、政治会议可采取双方对等会议的形式。双方的参加国家，应由各方自行决定，通知对方。
    二、政治会议的一切决定必须取得双方的一致同意。
    三、但为保证政治会议的顺利进行，会议必须有五个其他有关中立国家——苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸参加。
    根据上述方案，朝鲜政治会议的成员应是双方参加的国家和五个中立国。
    关于政治会议的地点问题，奇石福先生指出：由于政治会议将采取双方对等的形式而由中立国参加，所以会议的地点以板门店为适当。接着，中华人民共和国代表黄华先生发言，对奇石福先生所提出的我方关于会议形式和成员问题的建议，表示完全同意与支持。黄华先生强调指出，我方一贯认为政治会议应有双方以外的有关中立国家参加，并采取圆桌会议的形式，因为这种形式最便于使中立国家起和谐的作用；我们同时主张，在圆桌会议的形式之下，政治会议应保持双方对等的实质，即政治会议的一切决定必须取得交战双方的一致同意才能成立。由于对方反对圆桌会议的形式，所以我方建议政治会议采取双方对等会议的形式。但是双方对等会议的形式，决不能排斥有关中立国家参加政治会议，相反的，正因为采取了这种形式，就更应该有第三者参加政治会议，以便起和谐的作用。
    黄华先生指出，苏联不但是一个中立国，而且一贯倡导并努力于谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，因此自应在双方同意之下参加政治会议。至于其他的有关的亚洲中立国家，则不但因其本身的安全直接受朝鲜战争的威胁，所以与朝鲜问题的解决有密切的关系，而且它们曾为促成朝鲜停战作了重大的努力，因此亚洲有关的中立国家参加政治会议，必能发挥积极的作用。对方反对这些国家参加，是对所有亚洲的国家与人民的侮辱。
    黄华先生最后指出，美方代表在十六日代表会议上违反双方关于讨论方法的协议，在小组委员会尚未组成前即迳行进入实质问题的讨论，并在会外进行歪曲宣传，是很不恰当的。
    美方代表迪安在发言中仍然实质上拒绝中立国参加政治会议。他采取搪塞的办法，提出所谓在政治会议召开以后讨论发展至某种阶段时才邀请中立国参加的建议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表当即加以驳斥，指出对方此种所谓建议，不过是为了掩饰对方拒绝中立国参加政治会议的一种手段而已。
    在讨论时间问题的小组委员会中，我方首先发言，建议首先确定政治会议在今年十二月内召开。至于具体确定在十二月内那一天召开，则关系不大。因为关于任何议程项目的协议，须待其他项目均达成协议时才能成为最后的协议，政治会议能否早日开始，决定于五个项目的迅速协议，否则即使规定一个日子，也必然会落空。因此我方建议首先确定在十二月内召开，待成员与地点问题有达成协议可能时，再决定具体日期。对方发言则主张立即在十二月中旬确定一个具体日期。
    上述两个小组委员会将于十八日继续开会。
