    Comprehensive Bumper Harvest at Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County
    Preparing to Sell Over 200,000 Jin of Surplus Grain to the State
    The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County, Shanxi Province, having fully utilized the superiority of cooperative production, earned the title of Provincial First-Class High-Yield Model last year. This year, they overcame insect plagues and floods, achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest that surpassed last year's output.
    The cooperative comprises over 140 households, cultivating 6,141 mu of land. This year, they produced over 640,000 jin of various grains, exceeding the total output of all households before the war (1937) by double, surpassing the total output of 1950 by 31.6 percent, and exceeding last year's output by over 20,000 jin. Significant improvements in yield per unit area and reductions in production costs are the main features of this year's increased production. This year, the average yield per mu for the entire cooperative was 104 jin, an increase of over 40.5 percent compared to the normal yield of 74 jin, and a slight increase of less than 14 percent compared to last year's average yield per mu of 91.4 jin. Due to the increased yield per unit area, although the planting area for grain was reduced by over 650 mu due to planting pasture, the total output still exceeded last year's. In terms of costs, taking fertilizer as an example, last year a total of over 27,000 jin of oilseed cake was applied, equivalent to over 51,000 jin of grain. This year, due to increased manure accumulation, only manure fertilizer and fertilizer powder equivalent to over 8,400 jin of grain were purchased, reducing the investment by over 42,000 jin of grain compared to last year. Therefore, this year's actual grain harvest exceeded last year's by over 60,000 jin. Another feature of this year's increased production is that while farmers in surrounding villages experienced reduced yields due to disasters, Chenjiazhuang Cooperative still increased its output. The average yield per mu for three mutual aid teams, including Zhang Hong's in Tenjia Gou Village, was 75 jin, 29 jin less than Chenjiazhuang, and the average yield per mu for the entire Xizifeng Village was only 65 jin, 39 jin less than Chenjiazhuang Cooperative. With the increase in output, the income of the cooperative members also increased. Of the over 140 households in the cooperative, except for eight households whose income was lower than in previous years due to illness and less participation in labor, all other households increased their income compared to the past. Deng Fengming's family of three, with two laborers, used to harvest 17 or 18 shi of grain in good years, but this year they received 35 shi. Zhang Ru's family of seven, with only one laborer, also increased their actual income by more than 30 percent this year. The above distribution only accounts for agricultural income, excluding livestock income, which is equivalent to over 360,000 jin of grain. The overall income of the cooperative has increased by two times compared to before its establishment (1950).
    Why can the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative increase its production year after year? Why is its output higher than that of neighboring villages? Why could it still increase production this year despite the disasters? The fundamental reason is that they organized a production cooperative, fully utilizing the superiority of organized cooperative production—centralized land use, unified allocation of labor, better processing and application of fertilizer, improved technology, making the best use of the land, the best use of talent, and the best use of resources. Because the cooperative implements remuneration based on labor and division of labor based on specialties, it greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and potential of each member. The amount of labor done by the less strong Deng Fengming and the disabled Wu Gui families has increased by more than 100 workdays compared to the past. Moreover, due to the planned allocation of labor, this cooperative saved more than 3,000 workdays in the spring and summer seasons this year. Therefore, on more than 6,000 mu of land, the cooperative universally increased labor this year. In the past, each mu of land required three workdays throughout the year, but this year it required more than four workdays. The cooperative's land is completely cultivated with new-style plows, plowed deeply and evenly, which is conducive to the growth of crops. According to surveys, millet planted under the same soil and labor conditions, the roots of those plowed with old plows are three inches long with more than 20 root hairs, while those plowed with new plows are one foot long with more than 60 root hairs. In terms of fertilization, it has also increased from 15 dan per mu to 28 dan. Increased labor, increased fertilization, and the use of new agricultural tools have made the crops have deep roots and strong seedlings with outstanding disaster resistance. Therefore, during the continuous rainy season of more than half a month in autumn, the cooperative's crops were not affected in any way. Farmers or mutual aid teams in other villages did not have these conditions, and their crops suffered reduced yields due to the disaster.
    In the past, individual households managed their land in a scattered manner, and low-lying areas were prone to water accumulation during the rainy season. This spring, the cooperative used 200 man-days to build 13 large earthen embankments, each over 1,000 steps long, forcing the accumulated water into the reservoirs, preventing waterlogging in the low-lying areas. In August, just as the crops were heading, armyworms appeared in more than 30 mu of sorghum fields, spreading to more than 1,000 mu within a few days and burrowing into the ears. The cooperative immediately converted the production brigade into a pest control brigade, concentrating more than 170 people to completely eradicate the pests within five days. Due to the unified allocation of labor, harvesting was basically done one piece at a time, about ten days earlier than in previous years, avoiding wind and frost disasters.
    After the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative increased its output and income, the members deeply realized that this was the result of the correct leadership and strong support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and expressed that they would better follow the words of the Party and the People's Government in the future. They are prepared to sell over 200,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, buy back a dozen large livestock, and expand reproduction. (Yao Wenjin, Li Huamin)

    大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社全面丰收
    准备卖给国家二十多万斤余粮
    山西省大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社由于充分发挥了合作生产的优越性，去年曾获得全省一等丰产模范的称号，今年又战胜虫灾、涝灾，获得全面丰收，并超过去年产量。
    这个社共有一百四十多户，种地六千一百四十一亩。今年共生产各种粮食六十四万多斤，超过战前（一九三七年）各户总产量的一倍，超过一九五○年总产量百分之三十一点六，比去年也多收两万多斤。单位面积产量的显著提高和生产成本的降低是今年增产中的主要特点。今年全社每亩平均产量一百零四斤，比常年产量七十四斤提高百分之四十点五强，比去年每亩平均产量九十一斤四两提高百分之十四弱。由于单位面积产量的提高，今年虽因种植牧草缩小了六百五十多亩种粮面积，但总产量还超过去年。成本方面仅以肥料来说，去年共施饼肥二万七千多斤，合五万一千多斤粮食，今年由于积肥增多，只买了八千四百多斤粮的粪肥和肥田粉，比去年减少了四万二千多斤粮食的投资。所以今年实际上比去年多收粮六万多斤。今年增产中的另一个特点是周围各村庄农民都因灾减产，陈家庄社却仍然增产。滕家沟村张洪等三个互助组的每亩平均产量是七十五斤，比陈家庄少二十九斤，西紫峰村全村每亩平均产量才六十五斤，比陈家庄社少三十九斤。产量提高后，社员的收入也就增加了。全社一百四十多户中，除八户因为有病参加劳动的时间较少，收入不如往年外，其余各户都比过去增加。邓风鸣家三口人有两个劳动力，过去遇好年景能收十七、八石粮，今年分到三十五石。张儒家中七口人只有一个劳动力，今年的实际收入也比过去增加了百分之三十以上。以上分配只是农业收入部分，还有畜牧部分约合三十六万多斤粮食的收入不计在内。全社整个收入比建社前（一九五○年）增加了两倍。
    陈家庄农业生产合作社为什么能年年增产？产量为什么高于邻近各村？为什么今年遭灾还能增产？根本原因是他们组织了生产合作社，充分发挥了组织起来合作生产的优越性——土地集中使用、劳力统一调配、更好地加工施肥、提高技术、做到地尽其力、人尽其才、财尽其用。由于合作社实行按劳取酬、按特长分工，便大大发挥了各个社员的积极性和潜在力，劳动力不强的邓凤鸣和有残疾的吴贵两家所做劳动日都比过去增加一百多个。又由于有计划地支配劳力，这个社在今年春夏两季就节省了三千多个工。因此，这个社在六千多亩土地上，今年普遍加了工，过去每亩地全年做三个工，今年做了四个多工。这个社土地完全是新式犁耕种的，耕得又深又匀，便于庄稼生长。据调查，在同地同工等耕作条件下所种的谷子，旧犁耕的根长三寸、根须二十多股，新犁耕的根长一尺、根须六十多股。在施肥方面，也由每亩十五担提高到二十八担。多加工、多施肥、使用新农具，使得庄稼根深苗壮，抗灾力特别强，所以在秋季半个多月连阴雨时，该社庄稼没受任何影响，其他各村庄的农户或互助组因为没有这些条件，庄稼就因受灾而减产。
    过去各户土地分散经营，地势较低的地在雨季容易积水，今春社里用二百个人工，打了一千多步长的十三道大土塄，把积水逼到蓄水池里，使低地也避免了水淹。八月间，正当庄稼吐穗的时候，有三十多亩高粱地里发生行军虫，几天以内就蔓延了一千多亩，并且都钻在穗子里头，社内立即把生产大队改为除虫大队，集中一百七十多人在五天内把虫害全部扑灭。由于劳力统一调配，秋收中基本上做到熟一片割一片，比往年早收回庄稼十天左右，并避免了风霜灾害。
    陈家庄农业生产合作社的产量提高、收入增加后，社员们深深体会到这是由于共产党和人民政府的正确领导和大力支持的结果，表示今后要更好地按照党和人民政府的话办事。他们已准备把二十余万斤余粮卖给国家，买回十几头大牲畜，扩大再生产。　（姚文锦　李化民）
