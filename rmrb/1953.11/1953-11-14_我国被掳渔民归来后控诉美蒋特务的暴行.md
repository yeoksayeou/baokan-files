(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 13th) The victims of "psychological warfare" by the U.S. side are not only tens of thousands of prisoners of war but also many abducted civilians. This is another serious crime committed by the U.S. side in violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. This crime has been fully exposed by the recent return of eight elderly Chinese fishermen.

These eight elderly Chinese fishermen were abducted by a Li pseudo-army navy speedboat while fishing in the sea near Dadonggou, Andong, around July of the lunar calendar last year. According to the interpretation of "prisoners of war" in Article 4 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, these eight elderly fishermen were not prisoners of war but civilians. However, the U.S. side listed these eight fishermen in their fifties and sixties as prisoners of war and instructed Chiang Kai-shek's agents to persecute them cruelly, forcing them to "refuse repatriation" in an attempt to use them for "cold war" propaganda. Sun Caisheng, one of the returned elderly fishermen, personally heard a special agent "Detachment Commander" Zhang Yuwang say to another special agent, Chen Fusheng (one of the main culprits in the murder of Zhang Zilong), in July this year: "The higher-ups instructed us to keep a close watch on these old men, not a single one can be allowed to return home. In the future, they will be sent to Taiwan, and it will be said that these old fishermen are also unwilling to return to the Communists!"

In order to make these old fishermen "refuse repatriation," the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents used many cruel methods. These facts are what those who attempt to describe our side's explanatory work as "cruel" dare not face.

Sun Caisheng, a fifty-one-year-old fisherman, took off his clothes to show reporters that his chest and arms were forcibly tattooed with the words "Oppose Communism and Resist Russia," and a large Chiang Kai-shek party flag was tattooed on his back. Five other elderly fishermen were tattooed with the same terrible things.

Sun Caisheng told reporters through tears that he had been tattooed three times: The first time was in June this year. The agent Chen Fusheng held a stick and a needle, forcing Sun Caisheng to tattoo words on his right arm. The second time was in August this year. The agent Chen Fusheng cunningly asked Sun Caisheng:
	"Are you going home or not?" Before Sun Caisheng could answer, Chen Fusheng kicked him to the ground and said, "You are not firm enough, tattooing you will make you firm." Then he called three people to hold Sun Caisheng down and tattooed reactionary slogans all over his chest in one go. The most cruel was the third time. This was after arriving at the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp in October this year. At that time, Sun Caisheng became ill due to starvation, beatings, and various physical and mental tortures such as homesickness and fear in the prisoner of war camp, and his stomach was as bloated as a drum. When Sun Caisheng wanted to go to the hospital to see a doctor, the agent Chen Fusheng said that he was going to escape, tied his hands with a leather belt, had two people hold him down, and tattooed a Chiang Kai-shek party flag on his back. Sun Caisheng cried as he was tattooed, and his tears soaked the blanket on the bed. Chen Fusheng glared and said, "You cry!" and slapped him twice. Sun Caisheng cried to the reporters, "They made me look like this, trying not to let me come back!"

In addition to tattooing, the agents also used various threats and intimidation to prevent Sun Caisheng and other elderly fishermen from returning home. Sun Caisheng was often punished with hard labor for being homesick, having to carry forty or fifty buckets of water a day; sometimes he was also forced to kneel, beaten, and deprived of food. Sun Caisheng pointed to the large blue marks on the corner of his right eye and the back of his right hand and told reporters, "In June this year, I said, 'I really miss my children,' and the special agents beat me senseless with thick wooden sticks."

Sun Caisheng described his mental suffering in the U.S. prisoner of war camp, saying, "I wanted to go home, but I felt there was no hope of going home." He said that he lived in Liujiatun, Dagushan, Andong County, and had a wife and five children at home. Before liberation, his family had no house or land and suffered from hunger and cold every year; after liberation, his family was allocated twenty-two mu of land and four houses, and he could also fish in his spare time. Therefore, his life gradually improved. He said that in the prisoner of war camp, he couldn't sleep at night, so he tossed and turned thinking about these things. As he thought about it, he didn't dare to fall asleep, fearing that he would talk in his sleep and reveal his homesickness and be beaten. Therefore, he often dozed off during the day. He said, "At that time, I missed home so much that I was half asleep and half awake every day, in a daze."

When Sun Caisheng first saw the volunteer army observer representatives with badges on their chests at the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp, he couldn't help but shed tears. He wanted to give the volunteer army observer representatives a wink, but he didn't dare to do so because there were agents in front of and behind him. Later, he looked forward to our representatives going to explain every day. Every time he saw a jeep, he carefully looked to see if it was a representative of the Volunteer Army.

After the Zhang Zilong massacre, Sun Caisheng overheard two agents outside the tent on the evening of October 29 saying, "A large pit has been dug in the bathhouse. When we go out to listen to the explanation, we will lock the three old guys, Sun Caisheng, Zhang Shuliang, and Wang Xingcai, inside, nail them down with wooden boards, so that they can't listen to the explanation and can't return home." Sun Caisheng felt that there was no hope of listening to the explanation, so he decided to escape. At 4:30 p.m. on October 31, when it was raining, Sun Caisheng took advantage of the fact that the person monitoring him and the guards standing guard near the barbed wire were not paying attention, and climbed over the barbed wire, requesting repatriation. After he proved the fact that Kuomintang agents murdered Zhang Zilong to the neutral nations personnel, he was repatriated.

The fact that Sun Caisheng and other eight elderly fishermen were cruelly abused by the U.S. side proves that the U.S. government has completely torn up the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, which it itself signed. Such inhumane treatment of civilians by the U.S. side constitutes a "grave breach" of the Convention as condemned in Article 147. This is another clear proof that the U.S. government disregards all international laws and breaks its international obligations.

### 我国被掳渔民归来后控诉美蒋特务的暴行

    我国被掳渔民归来后控诉美蒋特务的暴行
    【新华社开城十三日电】被美方拿来充当“心理战”的牺牲品的，不仅有成千成万的战俘，而且有许多被掳去的平民。这是美方违反一九四九年日内瓦战时保护平民公约的又一个严重罪行。这一罪行由于最近八名我国老渔民遣返归来而完全暴露出来了。
    这八名我国老渔民是在去年旧历七月间在安东大东沟附近海面上捕鱼时被李伪军海军汽艇掳去的。按照关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约第四条对“战俘”一词的解释，这八名老渔民不是战俘而是平民。但是美方却把这八位五、六十岁的渔民列为战俘，并且指使蒋匪特务对他们进行残酷迫害，强迫他们“拒绝遣返”，企图利用他们来进行“冷战”宣传。归来的老渔民孙才生，在今年七月间亲自听见特务“大队长”张宇旺对另一个特务陈福生（谋杀张子龙的主犯之一）说：“上级指示，好好看住这些老头子，一个也不能让他回国。将来把他们送到台湾，就说这些老渔民也不愿回到共产党那儿去！”
    为了使这些老渔民“拒绝遣返”，美蒋特务使用了许多惨酷的方法。这些事实是那些企图把我方的解释工作形容成“残酷”的人所不敢正视的。
    五十一岁的老渔民孙才生脱下衣服给记者看，他的前胸和两臂都被强迫刺满了“反共抗俄”的字样，在背上还刺着一面很大的蒋匪党旗。另外五位老渔民的身上也被刺着同样的可怕的东西。
    孙才生流着眼泪告诉记者说：他曾经被刺过三次字：第一次是在今年六月间。特务陈福生提着棍子拿着针，硬逼着在孙才生的右臂上刺了字。第二次是在今年八月间。特务陈福生狡猾地问孙才生：
  “你回不回家？”还没有等孙才生回答出来，陈福生就一脚把他踢倒，并且说：“你不坚决，给你刺上字就坚决了。”接着他就叫了三个人来把孙才生按住，一口气给他在胸前刺满了反动字句。最残酷的是第三次。这是在今年十月来到东场里战俘营以后。当时，孙才生因在战俘营中挨饿、挨打，以及想家、恐惧等种种肉体上精神上的折磨而生了病，肚子胀得像鼓一样。孙才生要到医院去看病，特务陈福生就说他要逃跑，用皮带绑起他的双手，让两个人把他按住，又在他的背上刺了一面蒋匪党旗。一面刺，孙才生一面哭，眼泪把铺上的毯子都湿透了。陈福生瞪着眼说：“你哭！”顺手打了他两记耳光。孙才生哭着向记者说：“他们把我弄得这副模样，想不让我回来！”
    除了刺字以外，特务还用各种威胁、恐吓的手段来阻止孙才生等老年渔民回家。孙才生常因想家被罚苦工，一天要打四五十桶水；有时还被罚跪、挨打、不给饭吃。孙才生指着右眼角和右手背上大块青痕向记者说：“今年六月间，我说了一句‘我真想念我的孩子们’，特务分子就用很粗的木棒没头没脑地打我。”
    孙才生叙述他在美方战俘营中精神痛苦的情形说：“我是又想回家，又觉得回家没有希望了。”他说：他家住在安东县大孤山刘家屯，家里有妻子和五个孩子。解放前他家没房没地，年年挨饿受冻；解放后，家里分得了二十二亩地，四间房子，他自己在农闲时还可以打些鱼。因此他的生活就逐渐好起来。他说：在战俘营里时，晚上他睡不着觉，就翻来覆去地想这些事。想着想着，他就不敢睡着，怕睡着了说梦话讲出想家的念头而挨打，因而白天他常常打瞌睡。他说：“那时候想家想得天天似睡似醒，迷迷糊糊。”
    刚到东场里战俘营，孙才生第一次看见带着胸章的志愿军观察代表时，他的眼泪就忍不住地流了下来。他想递个眼色给志愿军观察代表，但是，由于自己前后都是特务，又不敢这样做。后来，他就天天盼着我方代表去解释。每看见一辆吉普车，他就仔细地看看是不是志愿军的代表来了。
    张子龙惨案发生后，孙才生曾在十月二十九日晚上听见帐篷外边两个特务说：“澡堂里已经挖好了一个大坑，我们出去听解释的时候，就把孙才生、张书良、王兴才三个老家伙关在里边，用木板钉牢，叫他们听不成解释，回不成国。”孙才生觉得听解释没希望了，便下决心逃跑。十月三十一日下午四点半，天下着雨，孙才生乘着监视他的人和附近铁丝网旁站岗的警备队员不注意的时候，就翻出铁丝网，要求遣返。他在中立国人员面前证明国民党特务谋杀张子龙的事实后就被遣返归来。
    孙才生等八位老渔民遭到美方残酷虐待的事实，证明美国政府已经彻底撕毁了它自己签字的一九四九年日内瓦战时保护平民公约。美方这种故意对平民施以不人道待遇的行为，构成了该公约第一百四十七条所谴责的“严重破坏公约行为”。这是美国政府蔑视一切国际公法、背弃它所承担的国际义务的又一个明证。
