Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 24th. According to an official communiqué issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 23rd, Indian guard troops recently intercepted a letter from the U.S. side to special agents in a prisoner-of-war camp. The letter contained a code and instructed the special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp to sabotage explanation work and kill prisoners-of-war who requested repatriation.

An Indian spokesperson described the interception of the letter on the afternoon of the 23rd. He said: "At approximately 9:00 AM on November 8, 1953, a Korean prisoner-of-war was arrested by Indian guard troops as he crawled along the drain towards the barbed wire of Camp (E) No. 40, attempting to enter the camp. This prisoner-of-war had likely escaped from this camp on November 6, 1953. A letter was found on his person containing instructions to certain organizations inside and outside the prisoner-of-war camp. The letter instructed members of this organization on how to maintain regular contact with each other. It also discussed the code for transmitting messages between them. The letter concluded by explaining how to force prisoners-of-war to resist explanation work, and stated that any prisoners-of-war who wanted to be repatriated should be killed to prevent the leakage of these secret instructions."

According to the communiqué from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will designate a subordinate body to investigate the interception of this letter.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission recently condemned the U.S. side for smuggling radio transceivers into the guard camps south of the demilitarized zone, and for using the U.S. 64th Field Hospital to transmit instructions to special agents. Now this incident has occurred again.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has decided to notify the Korean-Chinese side and the U.S. side of the content of the letter. The disclosure of the letter's content most powerfully demonstrates the close connection between the Syngman Rhee gang and the Rhee gang special agents in the guard camps who are openly resisting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian guard troops.

### 中立国遣返委员会发表公报  宣布截获李承晚特务携带的秘密指示的情形

    中立国遣返委员会发表公报
    宣布截获李承晚特务携带的秘密指示的情形
   【新华社开城二十四日电】据中立国遣返委员会二十三日发表的官方公报说：印度看管部队最近截获了美方给战俘营中的特务的一封信，信里附有密码，并指示东场里战俘营的特务们破坏解释工作和杀害要求遣返的战俘。
    一位印度发言人二十三日下午叙述了截获这封信的情形。他说：“在一九五三年十一月八日上午九时左右，一名朝鲜战俘顺着阴沟向（E）第四十号营场的铁丝网爬行，企图进入营场，当即被印度看管部队逮捕。这个战俘可能是在一九五三年十一月六日从这个营场逃出来的。在他身上搜出一封信，信里有对战俘营内外的某些组织的指令。信上指示这个组织的人员如何彼此经常保持联系。信上并且谈到在他们之间传递消息的密码。信上最后说明应如何迫使战俘抵制解释工作，并说明应将要想遣返的战俘一概加以杀害，以防泄露这些秘密指示。”
    据中立国遣返委员会的公报说，中立国遣返委员会将指定一个附属机构去调查截获这封信的情况。
    中立国遣返委员会不多久以前刚谴责过美方偷运无线电收发报机到非军事区南部看管营去，并且谴责美方利用美国第六十四野战医院向特务传达指令。现在又发生了这件事。
    中立国遣返委员会已经决定将该信内容通知朝中方面和美国方面。该信内容的暴露，最有力地说明了李承晚匪帮和在看管营中公然反抗中立国遣返委员会以及印度看管部队的李匪特务们存在着怎样紧密的联系。
