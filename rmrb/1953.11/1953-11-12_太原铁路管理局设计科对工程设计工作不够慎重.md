    The Design Section of the Taiyuan Railway Administration is Not Careful Enough in Engineering Design Work
    Liu Wensheng from the Material Room of the Third Basic Construction Engineering Team of the Taiyuan Railway Administration writes: The Design Section of the Taiyuan Railway Administration is not careful enough in engineering design, and many formal plans are changed arbitrarily or issued too late, resulting in serious confusion and waste in construction.
    Taking a part of the tasks of the Third Basic Construction Engineering Team of the Administration as an example. Due to the great blindness of the technical design of the Dongjin branch line project, many projects changed their plans during construction, so the purchase and transportation of materials were also very chaotic. The materials that were prepared were not used, and the materials that were needed were not prepared. The most serious case is the main bridge project. When the foundation was just starting to be piled, the design was changed, the project was stopped and not repaired, and many materials had to be transferred. Up to now, there are still many stones, sand and other materials scattered on the roadbed slope, causing a great waste of manpower and materials.
    For example, the Taiyuan South Station three-track relocation project started construction before the formal budget even had a shadow. When the material supply could not keep up, it grabbed materials from other professional projects, resulting in the actual material consumption of the project exceeding the plan by a lot. For the reconstruction project of the Guoshi Line, the materials were almost ready, and the formal plan was only issued. As a result, three-fifths of the prepared materials did not match the formal material plan.
    Due to blind design and frequent changes in engineering tasks, the construction site is very chaotic, and work-related injuries occur constantly, which seriously affects the progress of the project. I believe that this situation should arouse the serious attention of the Taiyuan Railway Administration and should be immediately inspected and corrected.

### 太原铁路管理局设计科对工程设计工作不够慎重

    太原铁路管理局设计科对工程设计工作不够慎重
    太原铁路管理局基本建设第三工程队材料室刘文升来信：太原铁路管理局设计科对工程设计不够慎重，有很多工程正式计划朝令夕改或者下达太晚，以致造成了施工中的严重混乱和浪费。
    就以该管理局基本建设第三工程队一部分任务为例。东晋支线工程由于技术设计带有很大的盲目性，很多工程在施工中改变了计划，因而材料的购置和运输也很混乱，已准备好的材料用不上，要用的材料又未准备好。最严重的是正桥工程，基础刚开始打桩时，设计改变了，工程停止不修，很多材料都要转移，到现在还有很多石、砂等材料散放在路基坡上，造成了人力物力的很大浪费。
    又如太原南站三股道改线工程在正式预算连影子都没有的时候就开工了，材料供应不上，就乱抓其它专业工程材料，造成工程实际用料超出计划很多。国师线改建工程，材料快要备齐了，正式计划才下来，结果已备材料有五分之三与正式用料计划不符。
    由于盲目设计，工程任务多变，工地情况十分混乱，不断发生工伤事故，严重影响了工程进度。我认为，这种情况应引起太原铁路管理局的严重注意，并立即予以检查和纠正。
