Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 15th: The "Times of India" published a dispatch from its special correspondent in Kaesong on November 12th on November 13th. The reporter said: "The people of Kaesong are working on construction with great enthusiasm."
    The reporter wrote: "Indian officers and soldiers, driving through the destroyed streets of Kaesong, once again witnessed the shocking scene of the massive bombing that leveled the entire town.
    Kaesong, this once prosperous border city on the 38th parallel, has been swept away into a pile of rubble. However, the indomitable spirit of the people, especially the youth, has endured, and their high morale and high degree of discipline can be seen everywhere. In the bombed-out streets and alleys, and in the squares with portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung, Mr. Nam Il, Mr. Malenkov, Mr. Mao Zedong, and Dr. Ho Chi Minh, there are happy, well-nourished schoolchildren everywhere, most of whom are war orphans.
    Along the twelve-mile road from the now demilitarized front line to Kaesong, Indian officers and soldiers saw new civilization growing everywhere. Unlike the United Nations forces' side of the armistice line, where mines have not been cleared and everything is barren, the land here is densely cultivated, all the way to the last military outpost. Farmers work under military protection to avoid possible looting on the border. They look well-nourished and well-clothed, unlike the poor people wandering around South Korea with no one to rely on.
    The first impression of the communist world generally felt by Indians entering this world is that people from all walks of life, whether they are farmers in the fields, schoolchildren in the streets, or soldiers at many roadside checkpoints, show good discipline and behave properly."

　　“印度时报”记者
    报道开城和平建设的景象
    【新华社新德里十五日电】十一月十三日“印度时报”发表了该报特派记者十一月十二日发自开城的一则电讯。记者说：“开城人民以极大热情在从事建设工作。”
    记者写道：“印度军官和兵士乘车驰过被破坏了的开城街道，又一次看见了夷平了整个城镇的狂轰滥炸的惊人景象。
    开城，这个正在三八线上的繁华的边境城市，就这样被扫平为一片废墟了。然而，人民，特别是青年的不屈精神却熬受了下来，在在可以看到他们的昂扬的精神和高度的纪律性。在毁于轰炸的街头巷尾，和挂着金日成元帅、南日先生、马林科夫先生、毛泽东先生、胡志明博士的画像的广场上，到处都是愉快的营养良好的学童，其中大部分是战争孤儿。
    沿着从现在已经非军事化的战线直至开城的十二英里长的公路上，印度官兵到处看见新的文明在成长。不像停火线联合国军这边地雷未挖、一片荒芜，这里的土地被密密地耕耘，一直耕种到最后的一个军事前哨岗位。农民们在军事保护之下工作，以免遭受边界上可能的劫掠。他们看上去营养颇佳，穿得也好，不像在南朝鲜贫民们到处漂流无依。
    一般印度人进入这个共产党世界的第一个印象就是，感到社会各界人民，田地上的农民也好，街道上的学童也好，许多路边检查哨的军人也好，都表现出良好纪律，举止规规矩矩。”
