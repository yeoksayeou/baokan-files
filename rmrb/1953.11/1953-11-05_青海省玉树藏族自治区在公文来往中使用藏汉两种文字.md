Qinghai Province Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region Uses Both Tibetan and Han Languages in Official Correspondence
The People's Government of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province has been using both Tibetan and Han languages in official correspondence. At the end of last year, the Autonomous Region established its first Tibetan printing factory. The People's Government of the Autonomous Region has also set up Tibetan secretarial and translation agencies to specialize in the translation of various Chinese documents. Now, the issuance of various government orders and documents in the Autonomous Region is printed in both Tibetan and Han languages. Han cadres working in the Autonomous Region are also actively learning Tibetan language, and many have been able to read Tibetan newspapers and write Tibetan letters, which has brought great convenience to their work. Tibetan people in the Autonomous Region are also enthusiastically learning Tibetan. Last winter, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region held four winter schools, with more than 400 Tibetan people participating in the study. Students and trainees in schools, literacy classes, and ethnic cadre training classes at all levels in the Autonomous Region are also actively learning Tibetan.

    青海省玉树藏族自治区在公文来往中使用藏汉两种文字
    青海省玉树藏族自治区人民政府在公文来往中，已行使藏汉两种文字。去年年底，自治区创建了第一所藏文印刷厂。自治区人民政府并设置有藏文秘书和翻译机构，专门从事各种汉文文件的翻译工作。现在，自治区各项政令、文件的下达，都已用藏、汉两种文字印行了。在自治区工作的汉族干部，也积极学习藏族语文，不少人已能阅读藏文书报和书写藏文信件，给工作带来了很大便利。自治区藏族人民学习藏文也很踊跃。去年冬季，自治区人民政府举办了四所冬学，参加学习的藏民有四百多人，自治区内各级学校、识字班、民族干部训练班内的学生和学员们也都在积极地学习藏文。
