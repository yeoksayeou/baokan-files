American liars have consistently referred to the Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents who were systematically infiltrated into the POW camps under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as "anti-communist POWs" and "POW leaders." Recently, Rear Admiral Paul T. Smith, the senior member of the US side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, even blatantly denied the presence of US special agents in the POW camps. The Swiss and Swedish representatives to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission actually echoed and aided the US side's shameless sophistry, saying that there were no special agents in the POW camps, but rather people with "firm political beliefs." This statement is merely a new version of the consistent American propaganda. Its purpose is to try to cover up the crimes of the US side in using special agents in the POW camps to control and kill POWs through violence, and to wantonly sabotage the explanation work, so that the US side can successfully and unscrupulously forcibly detain POWs and implement its shameful policy of so-called "cold war."

However, the facts written in blood cannot be erased by American liars. Before handing over the non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the US side had already carried out special organization of the POWs to facilitate the control of special agents, and had placed a large number of special agents in the POW camps. These special agents in the POW camps could carry knives and clubs, inflict cruel torture on the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, force them to recite slogans such as "Return to Taiwan," and deprive them of their right to listen to explanations and request repatriation. Special agents could even barbarously attack explanation representatives, forcibly detain personnel of the Indian Custodial Force, and even turn the camp "hospital" into a torture chamber and killing field. For example, our prisoner of war Zhang Liutai was strangled to death by special agents in the camp "hospital" because he said he wanted to "return to China"; Zhang Zilong was tortured, had his heart cut out and was killed for requesting repatriation, and finally was dismembered and his bones burned.

People must ask: Why were Zhang Zilong, Zhang Liutai and others who requested repatriation brutally murdered, and why could the so-called "POW leaders" carry knives (where did the knives come from?), commit violence, and eat human hearts and livers? Is cutting out hearts, dismembering corpses, and burning corpses and destroying evidence the "political belief" of these so-called "POW leaders"? These brutal Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agent executioners do not have even a trace of humanity or rationality. Their "belief" is to kill, is to barbarously obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, so the Swiss and Swedish representatives, as members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, actually describe this "belief" as legitimate, isn't this defending murderers?

A long time ago, our representatives submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a list of four hundred and sixty-six special agents who had infiltrated the POW camps, but the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not taken effective measures to this day. Under the wanton disruption of US special agents, the Indian Custodial Force has retreated from the first barbed wire fence of the POW camp to the last barbed wire fence, and the entire situation of the POW camp controlled by US special agents is still unknown. United Press International proudly declared: "The Indian army does not have a definite list, and they do not have all the prisoner's fingerprints from any of the camps." Obviously, it is the US special agents who are obstructing and undermining the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's fair execution of its duties, and any member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should regard the sabotage activities of the US special agents as an insult to the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. So, why and on what basis do the Swiss and Swedish representatives deny the part of the special agents with names and surnames proposed by our side, saying that they are not special agents but so-called people with "firm political beliefs"?

Moreover, when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission conducted a preliminary investigation into the Zhang Zilong incident on November 2 at our firm request, our returning personnel testified and identified seven murderers on the spot. Our returning personnel, Chang Fei'e, further revealed that before Zhang Zilong was brutally murdered, Zhang Yuwang, the leader of the murderers in Camp 28, asked him to take a letter to Zhang Zunxian, the "principal" of the C.I.E "school," the special agent organization of the US military headquarters in Camp 25, to ask for instructions on the murder of Zhang Zilong, and then Chang Fei'e brought back an "instruction letter" to Zhang Yuwang. A few days later, Zhang Zilong was killed. So, what are these Zhang Yuwang, Zhang Zunxian and the like if they are not special agents? Can the flag of "political belief" hide the tails of US special agents?

All the facts prove that there are not only Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the POW camps, but also that all special agent activities in the POW camps are completely directed by the US side. The US special agents engaged in the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth League" and "Anti-Communist Alliance" in the POW camps. The Indian spokesperson pointed out that the headquarters of these organizations were "located in Seoul and Taipei," and General Thimayya confirmed that "all evidence indicates that they received instructions from the Anti-Communist Youth League in Seoul." According to a report in the Hindustan Times on October 2, special agents have frequent contact with the US military headquarters. Indian sentries have discovered that people in the POW camps were signaling, and the US military side immediately returned the signal. The Indian Times reported: The Indian Custodial Force intercepted a secret letter that a "Korean prisoner of war" secretly passed to a "South Korean nurse" working in the US military hospital in the camp. "It was found that this was a letter written to a secret organization in Seoul that should not be spread, asking the organization for instructions on a problem that was not specifically stated." This so-called "POW leader" could actually ask the "secret organization" in Seoul for instructions through the hospital "nurse." What explanation do the Swiss and Swedish representatives have for this? Recently, the Indian Custodial Force also seized a radio transceiver from the food bags sent by the US side to the POW camp. The next day, Colonel Reynolds of the US side pretended to be "very surprised" and said: "I assure you that we do not do such things." He also wanted to pretend to cover up the US conspiracy to directly command special agents to sabotage the explanation work. May I ask: Who else but the US side can put this transceiver in the US food bag? Who did the US side want to send this transceiver to? Isn't it sent to the "POW leader" with "firm political beliefs"? Who do they want to contact with this thing? Doesn't this completely prove that the US side is systematically directing the activities of the Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the POW camps?

The Indian Times also revealed the fact that US special agents control the POW camps in a Korean dispatch published on November 9.

The Indian Times said: "There is such an open secret" that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war can never come out to listen to explanations "unless they have privately received orders from the United Nations Command" or "leaders of psychological warfare organizations"; and "at present, it is in the interest of the United Nations Command to allow this deadlock (that is, the paralyzed state due to the sabotage of US special agents) to continue"; at the same time, "the US strategy seems to be to instigate the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to give time limits to individual explanations." This is clear enough. The US side originally used dispatching special agents to control prisoners of war as a means, and "instigated the Swiss and Swedish members" to achieve its shameful goal of completely sabotaging the explanation work and forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Then, the US side's so-called claim that it is not special agents who control the POW camps, but rather "POW leaders" with "firm political beliefs" who control the POW camps, etc., are completely self-defeating lies!

    美国说谎家的诡辩
    冯之丹
    美国说谎家一直将其有计划地打入中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营的李、蒋特务分子，称之为“反共战俘”和“战俘领袖”，最近朝鲜军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西更矢口否认在战俘营中有美方特务。而中立国遣返委员会瑞士和瑞典代表居然为美方的这种无耻诡辩附和帮腔，说战俘营内并无特务，而是有“坚定的政治信仰”的人。这种说法仅仅是美国一贯宣传的新的翻版。它的目的是要竭力掩盖美方利用战俘营内的特务以暴力控制和屠杀战俘、恣意破坏解释工作的罪行，使美方可以得手应心地强迫扣留战俘，并实行其所谓“冷战”的可耻政策。
    然而，血写的事实是不容美国说谎家们加以抹煞的。美方在移交不直接遣返的朝、中被俘人员之前早已将战俘进行了便于特务控制的特殊编制，在战俘营中安插了大批特务。这些特务分子在战俘营内可以持刀携棍，对朝、中被俘人员横施酷刑，胁迫他们背诵“回台湾”等的口号，剥夺他们听取解释和要求遣返的权利。特务分子甚至可以横蛮地袭击解释代表，武力扣留印度看管部队的人员，甚至把营场“医院”也变成刑房和杀人场。如像我方被俘人员张六泰因为说要“回中国”，就在营场“医院”内被特务分子活活夹死；如像张子龙要求遣返竟遭非刑吊打，挖心处死，最后又被剁尸焚骨。
    人们要问：张子龙、张六泰等要求遣返为什么就遭到惨杀，而所谓“战俘领袖”又为什么能够持刀（刀从那里来的？）行凶、吃人心肝？难道挖心剁尸，焚尸灭迹就是这些所谓“战俘领袖”的“政治信仰”吗？这些残暴的李蒋特务刽子手连一丝一毫的人性和理性都没有。他们的“信仰”就是杀人，就是野蛮地阻挠战俘遣返，那末身为中立国遣返委员会成员的瑞士和瑞典的代表竟把这种“信仰”说成是合法的，这岂不是为杀人犯进行辩护吗？
    好久以前，我方代表就向中立国遣返委员会提出了混入战俘营的部分特务四百六十六人的名单，但是中立国遣返委员会迄今未对此采取有效措施。而在美方特务的恣意捣乱之下反而使印度看管部队从战俘营的第一道铁丝网退到了最后一道铁丝网之外，美方特务控制下的战俘营的全部情况都还无法知道，合众社曾得意地宣称：“印度军队并没有确实的名单，他们并没有任何营场的全部的战俘指印。”显然，正是美方特务在阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会公正地执行它的职责，任何中立国遣返委员会的成员都应该把美方特务的破坏活动视为对中立国遣返委员会职权的侮辱。那末，瑞士和瑞典代表究竟为什么，而且凭什么根据来否认我方提出的有名有姓的一部分特务，说他们不是特务而是所谓有“坚定的政治信仰”的人呢？
    而且，当十一月二日，中立国遣返委员会在我方坚决要求之下对张子龙事件进行初步调查时，我方归来人员已当场作证指认出七名凶杀犯来。我方归来人员常飞锷更揭发，张子龙被惨杀前，二十八号营场的凶手大队长张宇旺叫他带一封信给住在二十五号营场的美军总部特务组织C·I·E“学校”“校长”张遵贤请示谋杀张子龙的事，又由常飞锷带回给张宇旺一封“指示信”。过几天张子龙就被杀了。那末，这些张宇旺、张遵贤之类不是特务又是什么呢？难道以“政治信仰”的旗杆就能够隐藏得住美方特务的尾巴吗？
    一切事实都证明，战俘营中不仅有李、蒋特务，而且战俘营内的一切特务活动完全是由美方所指挥的。美方特务在战俘营中搞了什么“反共青年团”、“反共同盟”，印度发言人曾经指出，这些组织的总部“设在汉城和台北”，蒂迈雅将军证实说：“一切证据表示它们得到反共青年团从汉城发出的指示”。据“印度斯坦时报”十月二日报道，特务分子与美军司令部有经常联系，印度哨兵曾发现战俘营中有人打信号，美军方面即回信号。“印度时报”报道称：印度看管部队截获过一个“朝鲜战俘”偷传给营场美方医院中工作的“南朝鲜护士”一封秘密信件。“据发现：这是写给汉城某一秘密组织的不得外传的信件，信中请求该组织对某一没有特别言明的问题予以指示。”这个所谓“战俘领袖”竟能通过医院“护士”向汉城的“秘密组织”请示，关于这一点，瑞士和瑞典代表又作何解释呢？最近，印度看管部队还从美方送往战俘营的粮食袋中查获了一架无线电收发报机。第二天美方的雷诺上校装作“大吃一惊”地说：“我向你们保证，我们是不干这类事的。”还想装模作样地来掩饰美方直接指挥特务破坏解释工作的阴谋。试问：美方粮食袋中的这架收发报机除了美方自己还有谁能放进去呢？美方想把这架收发报机送给谁的？难道不是送给有
  “坚定政治信仰”的“战俘领袖”的吗？他们要这东西和谁联系呢？这件事难道不是完全证明了美方在有计划地指挥战俘营内李蒋特务的活动吗？
    “印度时报”在十一月九日刊载的一篇朝鲜电讯中，对美方特务控制战俘营的事实也作了揭露，
    “印度时报”说：“有这样一个公开的秘密”，朝、中战俘就绝不可能出来听取解释，“除非他们已经私下接到联合国军司令部”或者“心理战组织的领袖们”的命令；并且“在目前，让这种僵局（即因美方特务破坏而陷于瘫痪的状态）继续下去，正合联合国军司令部的心意”；同时，“美国的战略似乎是要唆使中立国遣返委员会的瑞士和瑞典委员对个别解释给予时限”。这就再清楚也不过了。美方原来是以派遣特务控制战俘为手段，并且“唆使瑞士和瑞典委员”来达到其彻底破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的可耻目的。那末，美方所谓不是特务控制战俘营，而是什么“政治信仰坚定”的“战俘领袖”控制着战俘营等等，岂不完全是不攻自破的鬼话！
