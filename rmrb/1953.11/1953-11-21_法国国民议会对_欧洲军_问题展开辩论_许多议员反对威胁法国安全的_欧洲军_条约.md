Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch, Paris: The French National Assembly began a debate on foreign policy on the 17th, with the "European Army" issue at the center of the debate.

In the first two days of the debate, many deputies spoke out against the so-called "European Army" and "European Defense Community" plans. They accused the "European Army" treaty of containing fatal dangers to France itself, and that it would allow German revanchists to establish dominance in Europe.

Deputy Le Noell (Republican Union of Social Action) said that the proposed "European Defense Community" plan would be "the resurrection of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, including France." Noell emphasized that once the "European Army" was established, there would be a great danger of war.

The "European Army" plan was also strongly denounced by Hi. de Chambrun, a member of the Progressive Republican Union. He said that the government was trying to implement the plan even before the parliament had approved it. De Chambrun concluded by saying that France should propose necessary measures to prevent the United States from arming West Germany, and that the National Assembly should demand that the government not undertake any obligations at the Bermuda Conference.

Gaëtan Barrette, a Gaullist deputy, also spoke out against the "European Army" plan. He said that ratifying the "European Army" treaty would be equivalent to approving the "death certificate" of the French army. General Adolphe Aumeran, a non-partisan deputy, said: "European integration will mean France heading towards death... Germany can enter this country as if entering an undefended city." He also opposed the idea of a so-called "united Europe," saying: "France's sovereignty, independence, and security are contradictory to the policy of unification."

Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet, Socialist deputies Jaquet, Defferre, Gouin, and Popular Republican Party deputy Coste-Floret spoke at the meeting, defending the "European Army" plan.

French newspapers revealed that the National Assembly held this debate before Laniel's upcoming trip to Bermuda as a conspiracy by supporters of the "European Army" plan, who were attempting to at least indirectly approve a plan to rearm West Germany.
Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch, Moscow TASS, 17th dispatch: The plan to establish the so-called "European Army" is arousing fierce protests among the French people. An article in "Combat" entitled "The National Drama" is enough to illustrate the problem.

The newspaper said: Attempts to deceive the French people with lies, illusions, and propaganda have failed. The problem caused by the "European Army" can trigger a surge of anger.

The newspaper said that the "European Army" is a "heinous creation, the purpose of which is only to provide the army that the Pentagon wants to use to form a crusade." The newspaper also believes that the "European Army" means "disintegrating the French army and joining a formless, supranational mixed army attached to the US General Staff."

The newspaper continued: "It would be a waste of effort to figure out what convincing reasons made our leaders agree to this method of self-destruction. There is no convincing reason, and if there is, there is only one: the 'European Army' is a bad thing with slightly less harm, because letting the German Wehrmacht revive alone would be an even worse thing. This is really a strange way to prevent German rearmament, the consequence of which is the elimination of the French army. Isn't this obvious to everyone? This 'slightly less harmful' bad thing is in fact the most harmful bad thing. Because if, eight years after the end of the war, Germany is still likely to rearm due to the complete disregard of our interests and our difficulties, wouldn't it be better for us to remain aloof and avoid being dragged into adventure by Germany in order to win reunification and recover its former territory?"

    法国国民议会对“欧洲军”问题展开辩论
    许多议员反对威胁法国安全的“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社二十日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会于十七日开始举行外交政策辩论，辩论中心是“欧洲军”问题。
    在辩论开始的头两天，许多议员们的发言都反对所谓“欧洲军”和“欧洲防务集团”的计划。他们指责“欧洲军”条约本身包含着对法国的致命危险，它将使德国复仇主义者在欧洲建立统治。
    议员利·诺埃尔（社会行动共和联盟）说，建议中的“欧洲防务集团”计划将是“包括法国在内的日尔曼民族的神圣罗马帝国的复活”。诺埃尔强调指出，“欧洲军”一旦建立，就会发生巨大的战争危险。
    “欧洲军”计划也遭到进步共和联盟盟员希·德香布兰的坚决斥责。他说，政府甚至在议会没有批准这个计划之前，就在尽力实现它。德香布兰最后说，法国应当提出必要的办法以阻止美国武装西德，国民议会应当要求政府不要在百慕大会议上承担任何义务。
    戴高乐派议员加斯东·巴列夫斯基也发言反对“欧洲军”计划。他说，批准“欧洲军”条约就等于批准法国军队的“死亡证”。无党派议员阿道夫·奥麦朗将军说：“欧洲整体化将意味着法国走向死亡……德国可以进入这个国家，如进入不设防的城市一样。”他还反对所谓“统一的欧洲”的观念，他说：“法国的主权、独立和安全是和统一政策相矛盾的。”
    社会党总书记摩勒、社会党议员雅盖、德费尔、古安和人民共和党议员戈斯特—弗罗雷等人在议会上发言，为“欧洲军”计划辩护。
    法国的报纸透露，国民议会在拉尼埃即将赴百慕大前举行这次辩论，是“欧洲军”计划的支持者的阴谋，他们企图至少间接批准一个重新武装西德的计划。
   【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：建立所谓“欧洲军”的计划正在法国人民中间引起激烈的抗议。“战斗报”发表一篇题为“民族的戏剧”的文章，足以说明问题。
    该报说：有关方面想用谎言、幻想与宣传来欺骗法国人民的企图失败了，“欧洲军”所引起的问题能触发一阵怒潮。
    该报说，“欧洲军”是一个“罪大恶极的创造，目的只是要提供五角大楼要用来组成十字军的军队而已”。该报还认为“欧洲军”意味着“把法国军队解体，而加入到一支附属于美国参谋本部的、无定形的、超国家的混合军队里去”。
    该报继称：“要想弄明白到底什么令人信服的理由使我们的领袖同意这种自绝的办法，那会是白费力气的。没有什么令人信服的理由，如果有，就只有一个：‘欧洲军’是一件为害稍少的坏事情，因为让德国国防军单独复活起来会是一件更大的坏事情。这真是一个防止德国重新武装的奇怪办法，这个办法的后果就是法国军队的消灭。这对大家还不很显明吗？这个‘为害稍少’的坏事情事实上是为害最大的坏事情。因为假如在战争结束以后八年，还会由于我们的利益和我们的困难完全遭到忽视，以致德国有可能重新武装起来的话，那么我们保持置身事外，避免德国为了争取重新统一并收回它以前的领土而把我们拖入冒险中，那不是更好吗？”
