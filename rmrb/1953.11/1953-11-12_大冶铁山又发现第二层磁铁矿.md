Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 11th: Another layer of magnetite with significant economic value has been discovered at the renowned Daye Iron Mine. This iron ore layer was discovered by Drill No. 19 of the Daye Exploration Team, less than 50 meters below the first layer of iron ore. The drill has now penetrated 47.7 meters into the second ore body, but has not yet passed through this new ore body. The ore extracted from the second layer of iron ore has been identified by geologists as a high-quality magnetite with a very high iron content. This new discovery is another major achievement in the geological exploration work of the Daye mining area, following the discovery of a new ore body in Jianlin Mountain. It further enriches the known iron ore reserves in the Tieshan area and plans a very gratifying prospect for finding more steel resources in the Daye mining area.

As early as May of last year, when the exploration work of Tieshan began, the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government hired Soviet expert Krotki to help with the exploration design of Tieshan. This geologist, who is over fifty years old, braved the heat and walked all over Tieshan. He proposed that, based on the superior geological conditions of Tieshan, there is a great possibility of the existence of a second layer of iron ore. He also helped the exploration team specifically determine the location of the boreholes. According to the Soviet expert's suggestion, the exploration team took a heavy-duty drilling machine capable of drilling 1,200 meters deep and installed it in the place suggested by the Soviet expert for exploring the second layer of iron ore. Only ten days after the drilling machine started, a huge crack was encountered in the borehole, which brought great difficulties to the drilling work, and only a few inches could be drilled in a day. However, the exploration personnel's will to implement the Soviet expert's suggestions did not waver. They learned from advanced Soviet experience and used the "mud slurry method" to overcome difficulties. Every day, more than 200 workers took turns carrying yellow mud up the mountain day and night. A total of more than 117,000 loads of yellow mud were put into the borehole in two months, and finally the cracks in the hole were blocked. In addition to their work, the drillers also spent an hour a day specifically learning technology. After more than five months of training, most of the apprentices learned all the operations of the heavy-duty drilling machine, and the drilling efficiency increased by more than double. Through persistent efforts, the second layer of iron ore was finally discovered. Now, this drilling machine is still continuing to drill in the new ore body. In order to confirm the thickness of the second layer of iron ore more quickly, the drillers of Drill No. 19 have put forward the fighting goal of guaranteeing the completion of this year's scheduled tasks ten days ahead of schedule.

### 大冶铁山又发现第二层磁铁矿

    大冶铁山又发现第二层磁铁矿
    【新华社武汉十一日电】著名大冶铁山又发现了具有重大经济价值的第二层磁铁矿。这层铁矿是大冶勘探队第十九号钻机，在第一层铁矿下面不到五十公尺的地方发现的。这部钻机现在已向第二层矿体钻进了四十七点七公尺，可是还没有穿透这个新矿体。从第二层铁矿里取出的矿石，经过地质人员鉴别后，证明是一种含铁率很高的优质磁铁矿。这一新发现是继尖林山发现新矿体之后，大冶矿区地质勘探工作的又一重大成就。它进一步地丰富了铁山地区已知的铁矿储量，为大冶矿区寻找更多钢铁资源规划出了一个十分可喜的前景。
    还在去年五月铁山开始勘探工作时，中央人民政府地质部就聘请苏联专家克罗特基帮助铁山的勘探设计。这位五十多岁的老地质专家，冒着炎热走遍了铁山的每个山头。他提出：根据铁山这样优越的地质条件，有着存在第二层铁矿的巨大可能性。他并且帮助勘探队具体确定了钻孔的位置。勘探人员们根据苏联专家的建议，就领了一部能打一千二百公尺深的重型钻机，把它安装在苏联专家建议用来勘探第二层铁矿的地方。钻机开动才十多天，钻孔里就遇到一个巨大的裂缝，这给钻探工作带来了很大困难，一天只能钻进几公寸。但是，勘探人员们执行苏联专家建议的意志并没有动摇。他们学习苏联先进经验，使用“泥浆作业法”来克服困难。每天有二百多工人日夜轮流地挑黄泥上山，两个月中投入钻孔里的黄泥共有十一万七千多担，最后堵住了孔内的裂缝。钻工们除了工作以外，每天还抽出一个钟头时间专门学习技术。经过五个多月的锻炼，大部分徒工都学会了重型钻机的全部操作，钻进效率提高了一倍多。经过坚持的努力，终于发现了第二层铁矿。现在，这部钻机还在新矿体里继续钻进着，为了更快地证实第二层铁矿的厚度，第十九号钻机的钻工们，已提出保证提前十天完成今年预订任务的奋斗目标。
