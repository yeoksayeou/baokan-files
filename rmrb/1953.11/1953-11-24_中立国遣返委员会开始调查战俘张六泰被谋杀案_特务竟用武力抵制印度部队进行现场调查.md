Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 21st: Today, the U.S. side directly directed special agent elements to resist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the murder of POW Zhang Liutai in the U.S. "hospital" at Dongchang-ri. Members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary bodies and witnesses from the Korean and Chinese sides stood outside the "hospital" compound for about an hour, and were unable to approach Camp 44, where the murder took place.

Initially, after the Indian custodial troops surrounded the camp, special agent elements in Camp 44 locked the POWs in tents, preventing them from coming out to be investigated. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops decided to allow witnesses to enter the camp and conduct investigations in each tent. But at this moment, around 7:20 AM, special agent elements from Camps 45 and 46, adjacent to Camp 44, suddenly forced POWs to break through the first barbed wire fence and reach the passage around the camp. The special agents, armed with stones and sticks, shouted that they wanted to charge into Camp 44. Faced with this situation, the Indian custodial troops were unable to open fire to stop the special agent riot, as they had done during the investigation of the Zhang Zilong murder case on November 2nd, nor were they able to enter the camp and bring out the POWs. Thus, the special agent elements used force to threaten the Indian custodial troops, and the Indian custodial troops, bound by "no use of force," retreated in the face of the special agent elements.

The Indian custodial troops have reported this situation to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission held a meeting at 10:00 AM today to discuss this situation.

Today's action by the special agent elements to resist the investigation was entirely due to the unified prior arrangement by the U.S. side. At 7:15 AM, when the motorcade of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary body responsible for the investigation, witnesses, and reporters from both sides arrived at the "hospital," special agent elements were already outside the tents in Camp 44 on the lookout. As soon as they saw the motorcade arrive, they waved a flag to Camps 45 and 46. A few minutes later, special agent elements from these two camps forced POWs to break through the first barbed wire fence. These special agent elements knew in advance that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was going to conduct an investigation, obviously because the U.S. side had given them a tip-off. The recent communiqués issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have repeatedly pointed out to the world that the Dongchang-ri POW camp "hospital" is a U.S. hospital, and the U.S. military authorities maintain close contact with special agent elements in the POW camp through "administrative personnel" serving in the "hospital." On November 14th, in a resolution, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cited the fact that the Indian custodial troops had intercepted letters delivered by special agents in Camp 49 to female nurses in the "hospital," condemning the U.S. military authorities and demanding that they take urgent measures to prevent any further illegal activities by U.S. personnel.

The U.S. side had long ago informed the special agent elements about the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's intended investigation. According to Yu Huiyu, a former Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW who applied to return to his homeland on November 10th, two or three nights before he escaped from the "hospital" camp, he heard Deng Hongxun, the special agent who ordered the murder of Zhang Liutai, say to special agent Yu Rongfu and others: "Wang Xianzhang (the witness who witnessed the murder of Zhang Liutai) is coming to arrest us, we must be prepared, and we will fight him when he comes!" This was one or two days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission investigated the Zhang Zilong murder case and arrested seven perpetrators. Obviously, after receiving the notice on the 20th that an on-site investigation would be conducted on the 21st, the U.S. side used the same method to send instructions to disrupt the investigation work to the special agent elements in its own "hospital" through its own "staff."

The U.S. side directly directed special agent elements to use force to threaten the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops, making it impossible for them to perform their most basic duties. Today's fruitless investigation once again proves that unless the use of force is permitted to deal with those special agent elements who use force, it will only encourage them to further and thoroughly undermine the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." In fact, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the right to use force. Although the "scope of authority" stipulates that "no force or threat of force shall be used against prisoners of war to obstruct or coerce their repatriation," it also clearly stipulates that "nothing in this agreement shall be construed as impairing the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its lawful functions and responsibilities to control prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction."

### 中立国遣返委员会开始调查战俘张六泰被谋杀案  特务竟用武力抵制印度部队进行现场调查

    中立国遣返委员会开始调查战俘张六泰被谋杀案 
    特务竟用武力抵制印度部队进行现场调查
    【新华社开城二十一日电】今天美方直接指挥特务分子抵制了中立国遣返委员会对东场里美国“医院”中战俘张六泰被谋杀案的调查。中立国遣返委员会附属机构委员们和朝中方面的证人们只在“医院”营区外面站了大约一个钟头，甚至根本未能接近发生谋杀案的第四十四号营场。
    最初，在印度看管部队包围了营场以后，第四十四号营场的特务分子把战俘们关在帐篷里，不让他们出来接受调查。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队决定让证人进入营场，到每一个帐篷里去进行调查。但正在这时候，即七时二十分左右，邻近四十四号营场的四十五、四十六号营场中的特务分子，突然强迫战俘冲出了第一道铁丝网，到了营场周围的通道上。特务们手里拿着石头和棍棒，叫喊着要冲向第四十四号营场。印度看管部队面对这种情况，没有能够像十一月二日调查张子龙被谋杀案时那样开枪制止特务骚动，也没有能够进入营场带出战俘。这样，特务分子对印度看管部队使用了武力威胁，而印度看管部队却受着“不得使用武力”的束缚，在特务分子面前撤退了。
    印度看管部队已把这种情况报告了中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军。中立国遣返委员会在今天上午十时召开会议讨论这一情况。
    今天特务分子抵制调查的行动，完全出于美方事先的统一布置。七时十五分，当负责调查的中立国遣返委员会附属机构、证人及双方记者的车队到达“医院”时，四十四号营场内早已有特务分子在帐篷外了望。他们一看见车队到达，就向四十五、四十六号营场摇动一面旗子。数分钟后，这两个营场中的特务分子就强迫战俘冲出了第一道铁丝网。这些特务分子事先就知道中立国遣返委员会要进行调查，显然是因为有美方给他们通风报信。最近中立国遣返委员会发表的公报已一再向全世界指出：东场里战俘营“医院”是美国医院，美军当局通过在“医院”中服务的“行政人员”和战俘营中的特务分子保持着密切联系。十一月十四日，中立国遣返委员会在一项决议中举出印度看管部队截获四十九号营场中的特务递交“医院”中女护士的信件的事实，谴责了美军当局，并要求它采取紧急措施来防止美方人员再有任何非法活动。
    美方早就将中立国遣返委员会要进行调查的消息告诉了特务分子。据十一月十日申请遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员余辉如说，在他逃出“医院”营场前两三天的一个晚上，他听到下令杀害张六泰的凶犯特务邓鸿勋对特务于荣福等说：“王宪章（目睹张六泰被谋杀的证人）要来抓我们了，我们要做好准备，他来了就和他拚！”这时候正是中立国遣返委员会调查谋杀张子龙案、逮捕七名凶犯以后一、两天。显然，美方在二十日接到关于二十一日将进行现场调查的通知后，已用同样的方法，把破坏调查工作的指示，通过它自己的“工作人员”送给了在它自己的“医院”中的特务分子。
    美方直接指挥特务分子用武力威胁中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队，使得它们不能执行其最起码的职责。今天的无结果的调查，再一次地证明如果不准使用武力来对付那些使用武力的特务分子，就只能鼓励他们进一步地彻底地破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。而实际上，中立国遣返委员会是有权使用武力的。“职权范围”虽然有不得对战俘“使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返”的规定，但它同时明确规定，“本协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。”
