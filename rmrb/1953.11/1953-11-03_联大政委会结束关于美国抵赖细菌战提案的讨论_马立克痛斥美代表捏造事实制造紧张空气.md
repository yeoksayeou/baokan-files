Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 2nd: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of October 31st, concluding the discussion on the so-called "impartial investigation of accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by United Nations forces."

    U.S. Representative Mayo spoke first. He repeatedly reiterated their anti-Soviet slanders, attempting to cover up the basic facts presented by Soviet Representative Malik during the discussion. Mayo concluded by saying that the Soviet proposal to require countries that have not participated in or ratified the Geneva Protocol to do so should not be supported.

    Soviet Representative Malik spoke, refuting Mayo's slanders. He also emphasized that the reason the U.S. representative so absurdly fabricated facts was to worsen the international situation, because most reactionary groups in the United States fear the recent easing of international tensions and want to incite war hysteria.

    Malik pointed out that the United States had just submitted a new agenda to the General Assembly regarding so-called "atrocities" committed in Korea, also for the same purpose.

    Malik presented evidence showing that the real reason the United States firmly opposes ratifying the Geneva Protocol lies with the chemical trusts that produce bacteriological weapons, who oppose ratifying the Geneva Protocol because they would lose profits if the protocol were ratified.

    Subsequently, representatives from various countries spoke to explain their reasons for voting. Then, the Political Committee decided to first vote on the joint proposal of the United Kingdom, Canada, Colombia, New Zealand, and France, which advocated referring the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for consideration. The result of the vote was 47 in favor and 13 abstentions, and the five-nation proposal was adopted. The Political Committee also decided, with 38 votes in favor, 5 against, and 15 abstentions, not to vote on the Soviet proposal.

    联大政委会结束关于美国抵赖细菌战提案的讨论
    马立克痛斥美代表捏造事实制造紧张空气
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十月三十一日上午举行会议，结束了所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”问题的讨论。
    美国代表梅奥首先发言。他再三重复他们的反苏谰言，要想以此来把苏联代表马立克在讨论过程中提出的基本事实掩盖起来。梅奥最后说，苏联提出的要求没有参加或批准日内瓦议定书的国家参加或批准这一议定书的提案，是不应加以支持的。
    苏联代表马立克发言驳斥梅奥的谰言。他并且强调指出：美国代表所以这样荒谬地捏造事实，就是为了使国际局势恶化，因为美国大多数反动集团害怕最近国际局势的缓和，要想煽动战争歇斯底里。
    马立克指出：美国刚向大会提出了一项所谓在朝鲜所犯的“暴行”的新议程，这也是为了同样的目的。
    马立克提出证据说明，美国所以坚决反对批准日内瓦议定书，真正原因在生产细菌武器的化学托辣斯身上，这些托辣斯反对批准日内瓦议定书，因为如果这议定书获得批准，它们就会失去利润。
    接着，各国代表发言说明投票理由。然后政委会决定首先表决英国、加拿大、哥伦比亚、新西兰和法国五国的联合提案，这个提案主张把苏联提案转交联合国裁减军备委员会审议。表决结果，四十七票赞成，十三票弃权，五国提案获得通过。政委会并以三十八票赞成、五票反对、十五票弃权，决定不对苏联提案进行表决。
