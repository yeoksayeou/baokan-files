Farmers in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, actively report illegal merchants engaged in grain speculation, refuse to sell grain to profiteers, and assist the government in its grain purchasing and sales efforts.

The People's Court of Hengshan County and the district offices in various districts have successively received reports from many farmers exposing the speculative activities of illegal merchants in the grain market. For example, Liu Jucai, a lime merchant from Xinkai Township, Sixth District, under the guise of selling lime, colluded with three other profiteers after the autumn harvest this year to raise lime prices in the Xinkai Township area to exchange for sixty to seventy dan of rice, intending to transport it elsewhere for profit. Farmer Liu Fengxiang, after discovering their speculative activities, believed that their behavior seriously affected the state's grain purchasing work and harmed the interests of the state and all the people, so he reported them to the Sixth District Office. Another example is the owner of the Yi Chun Pharmacy in Baichaoling, Sixth District, who, after the autumn harvest, under the pretense of collecting debts, took the opportunity to snap up rice, intending to hoard it and sell it at a high price in the future. Zhao Lansheng, the militia captain of Songqiao Township, after discovering this situation, reported him to the district office. Dai Yanben, a farmer from Beiwang Township, Eighth District, even made a special trip from the countryside to the city to report to the county people's government the illegal activities of speculative profiteers who were obtaining grain from cooperatives, and suggested that the government improve grain supply work.

Many farmers in Hengshan County refuse to sell grain to private merchants,打击打击 [dǎ jī] [strike; hit; attack; crack down on; combat; a blow] the speculative activities of illegal profiteers. For example, Zhao Hexian, a farmer from Quanhushan Township, Tenth District, carried a load of rice to the cooperative to sell on October 24th. On the way, many profiteers offered high prices to intercept and buy it. Zhao Hexian said to the profiteers: "No matter how much money you offer, I won't sell it to you. Gaining a little 'advantage' from you now, letting you speculate and disrupt things, will only mean giving you a pile of money in the future!" He carried the rice all the way to the cooperative and said to the cooperative cadres: "I won't fall for the profiteers' tricks. Greeding for small gains now will lead to big losses later! Selling grain to the cooperative not only guarantees price stability but also supports the country's industrial construction."

These patriotic actions of the farmers in actively fighting against the profiteers have greatly helped the people's government's grain purchasing and sales work.

    湖南省衡山县农民积极检举粮食投机商
    湖南省衡山县许多农民，积极检举进行粮食投机的不法商人，拒绝把粮食卖给奸商，协助政府做好粮食的收购和销售工作。
    衡山县人民法院和各区区公所先后收到许多农民揭发不法奸商在粮食市场上进行投机活动的报告。如第六区新开乡石灰商刘聚财，假借销石灰的名义，今年秋收后和另外三个奸商在新开乡一带提高石灰价格套换稻谷六、七十石，准备外运牟利。农民刘凤祥发现他们的投机活动后，认为他们这种行为严重影响了国家的购粮工作，危害着国家和全体人民的利益，便到第六区区公所检举了他们。又如第六区拜朝岭易纯药号老板，秋收以后假借收账为名，趁机抢购稻谷，准备囤积起来，将来高价出售。宋桥乡民兵队长赵兰生发现这一情况后，就向区公所检举了他。第八区北望乡农民戴焱本还特地从乡下赶到城里，向县人民政府揭发投机奸商向合作社套购粮食的不法活动，并建议政府改进粮食供应工作。
    衡山县许多农民拒绝卖粮给私商，打击不法奸商的投机活动。如第十区泉湖乡农民赵和贤，在十月二十四日挑了一担稻谷到合作社去卖，路上有不少奸商出高价拦购。赵和贤对奸商们说：“你们出的钱再多我也不卖给你们，现在‘多’得你们几个钱，让你们投机破坏，将来还要把一堆钱给你们！”他把稻谷一直挑到合作社，还向合作社的干部说：“我可不上奸商的当。现在贪小利，以后要吃大亏！把粮食卖给合作社既能保证物价稳定，还支持了国家的工业建设。”
    这些农民积极和奸商斗争的爱国行动，大大帮助了人民政府的购粮和售粮工作。
