	Original Author: V. Azhayev Screenwriter: M. Papava Director: Alexander, Stolper Translator: Yang Fan Produced by Moscow Film Studio Translated by Shanghai Film Studio, Central Film Bureau

	The film "Far From Moscow," adapted from the long novel of the same name by Soviet writer Azhayev, preserves the central plot line and main characters of the novel. Through the arduous natural setting of the Far East, it shows how the Soviet people, during the Great Patriotic War, transformed the work of important industrial sectors in the Far East rear area to meet the needs of the war. The film highlights the image of the construction project leader, Batmanov, and depicts his Bolshevik leadership art.

	The film concentrates the dramatic conflicts of the novel, first showing that Bolshevik leaders are in a situation of serious difficulties. From the beginning of the film, we see that all of Batmanov's leadership work is facing immense difficulties. He is confronted not only by conservative and backward former chief engineer Grubsky, who is inheriting bourgeois design concepts and stubbornly resisting the new requirements of national construction projects, but also within Batmanov's own fighting team, some people do not understand the great significance of building the Far East oil pipeline for the Patriotic War. They believe that running to the Far East is "hiding in the rear" and evading the responsibility of defending the motherland, and they firmly demand to leave their construction posts and go to the front. This was the initial thought of the young engineer Alexei. Batmanov's task is, on the one hand, to overcome conservative and backward thinking, and on the other hand, to guide the emotions of Alexei and others, so that their enthusiasm for the motherland turns to arduous construction work. At the beginning of the film, we see how the former chief engineer Grubsky resisted the new plan for the construction project. He stated many difficulties and reasons, explaining that the successful construction of the oil pipeline could never be completed within one year, but would require three years. What are the difficulties he mentioned? He believes that in the Far East, with severe winter climates for seven months of the year, construction is simply impossible. He does not see that the creative power of the Soviet people can overcome these difficulties. Moreover, he does not pay attention to collecting sufficient data in his design work and ignores the correct suggestions of the local masses. He believes that the left bank of the river is often flooded, so he blindly affirms that the oil pipeline laying route must be set on the right bank. But in fact, the right bank of the river has continuous hills and mountains, with hardly any villages or towns, making construction of the route very difficult. On the left bank, however, the route can extend along the wide, flood-proof sloping embankments and can also get help from local residents when laying the line.

	The reason why the former chief engineer cannot see these favorable conditions and stubbornly sticks to his own ideas is because he does not conduct on-site inspections. Deep in his mind, he is still infatuated with bourgeois technical viewpoints. His theory is based on the opinions of German and American technical "authorities." He does not dare to break through the technical regulations that "no one in the world has experimented with before" with a revolutionary spirit.

	The problem raised by the former chief engineer puts two paths in front of Batmanov: either be frightened by the bourgeois technical authority's viewpoint and stop doing the work of building the urgently needed national oil pipeline; or use a revolutionary spirit and socialist construction ideas to overcome numerous difficulties, extract the oil urgently needed by the country in wartime, and transport it to the front.

	Batmanov chose the latter path, and he organized a "battle for oil production" in the rear area thousands of miles away from Moscow. When he discovered that there were two sharp ideological oppositions in the engineering design, he supported the new design plan formulated by the new chief engineer, Beridze, with Bolshevik principles and refuted Grubsky's conservative thinking. Batmanov resolutely and bravely undertook the task given by the motherland in a situation where the time limit for the project was very urgent. In a meeting in the film, we can see that he expressed to the engineers in a very mature and keen way: "The old plan will inevitably be revised or changed." The novel describes the discussion about the construction route in this way: Batmanov affirmatively said, "We see, we know, and we firmly believe that the new technical plan is very practical, based on calculations and surveys, and based on the experience of all engineers, not just Beridze's personal experience." Therefore, Batmanov said very confidently here: "In the final analysis, I am the first person to be responsible to all of you and to the fate of the construction project. I am not afraid to take responsibility for the consequences caused by my decision." He said: "I have asked myself this question - is the problem of laying the oil pipeline within one year only a problem that arises during wartime? Or is the three-year deadline fundamentally wrong? In my opinion, in any case, it is not permissible to spend so long laying the oil pipeline, even before the war, it should not be laid on the right bank without considering the interests of the local people and their help, and without considering how to save expenses as much as possible."

	This is the fundamental difference between the old and new design schemes: from the design scheme led by Batmanov, we can see the content of high political thought, that is, the road opened up by laying the line will benefit the lives of the people in the long term. The engineering viewpoint of the ideologically conservative Grubsky is not based on surveys for the design, and at the same time, in the construction project, political, economic, and technical issues are not linked together for investigation.

	While supporting new design ideas and opposing conservative and backward engineering viewpoints, another major thing Batmanov did was to vigorously adjust his team. Batmanov firmly believes that the development of the project relies on the enthusiasm of the masses, and at the same time, he is always good at using criticism to unite and educate cadres, and lead the entire collective forward. In the film, we see that Batmanov uses great love and strict adherence to discipline to guide all the passion of patriotic youths such as Deputy Chief Engineer Alexei, who are eager to go to the front, to construction work. From the vivid descriptions in the film, we can see that Batmanov has penetrated the souls of his cadres, not only understanding them but also being good at using appropriate methods to untie their ideological knots. He flexibly used the weapon of criticism, and moved his cadres with his noble personality and loyalty to the motherland and to Stalin. The active forces of the masses gathered around him.

	Batmanov's leadership is also manifested in grasping the overall situation, delving into key points, and systematically checking the implementation of instructions. His working style is neither to carry out "general" leadership by signing "orders" nor to rely on written correspondence. In the original novel, Batmanov said to the supply director: "I have a rule, which is to personally check the implementation of my principled orders." He grasps the overall situation on the one hand and conducts specific leadership on the other. Like a military commander deploying a battle, he particularly values communication and liaison work so that he can contact various engineering sections at any time and remotely, so as to facilitate the command of the construction project.

	When Batmanov is establishing his working order without relaxing, we see that he is not only skillfully grasping the progress of the project's survey, design, transportation of construction materials, and living materials, but also never forgets to delve into and check the key or weak links in the work. At the end of the film, we see that Batmanov is using all his strength to break through the difficulties of the strait engineering section. On the vast frozen strait, the underwater blasting method of the predecessor engineer Topolev was adopted, and the labor army led by Batmanov won a great victory. This victory shattered Grubsky's nonsense that it was impossible to dig trenches and lay oil pipelines underwater.

	In the progress of the project, the labor enthusiasm of the masses was organized into a mutual competition among the three engineering core sections led by Chief Engineer Beridze, Alexei, and Rogov. Batmanov cooperated with the Party committee secretary to guide the progress of the entire project, forming the soul of the combat organization work. The victory of the construction project led by Batmanov in the film shows the victory of socialist design thinking and the power of the patriotic ideology of all the builders of the project.

	"Far From Moscow" depicts the Bolshevik leadership art in construction projects, and at the same time, it also centrally reflects the enthusiasm of the vigorous socialist builders. Through some meticulous depictions of life's aspects, the film shows that the construction work carried out in the distant rear area is intimately related to the war that was going on at that time. The film expresses the deep political and emotional unity of people in the difficult times of the war through the sacrifice of the father of the child Genka, who asked to join the communications team, the fact that the family of the supply director Liebermann was blocked in Leningrad by the war, the news of the death of Alexei's wife, and other plots. The most profound and touching of these is the scene where Batmanov personally tells the child Genka that his father has died; this scene vividly depicts Batmanov's loving and heroic inner feelings. The film also depicts the correct and friendly relationship between Beridze, Alexei, and Topolev, the two generations of engineers, Party and non-Party experts, reflecting the mass character of the heroic construction cause. The mass heroes who emerged in this great construction project are countless. The film prominently narrates the achievements of the young female engineer Daniya's communications team, depicting the scene of the young people working hard in the blizzard.

	To match the entire story, the film has a beautiful overture and theme melody, and the music has a strong lyrical meaning for the natural environment in the film, making people yearn for and love the Far East. At the same time, this film has many excellent and mature Soviet actors, and two brand-new actresses (T. Makhova, who plays Daniya, and I. Kiseleva, who plays Zhannya) participate in the performance. The role of Batmanov in the film is played by the famous Soviet actor Okhlopkov [Note]. When playing the role of Batmanov, this famous actor went through full emotional preparation for every detail of his performance. The tone of his performance is to use all the patriotic emotions and clear wisdom hidden in his heart, as well as the cautious and decisive spirit of a senior staff member of the state organs, inspecting the environment, listening to reflections, thinking, and judging. His successful performance truly reveals the subtle and firm image of a Bolshevik leader. The audience can feel humility and warmth from the image he created, and feel the initiative and excitement of the Soviet Communists when completing great historical tasks in extremely difficult circumstances. [Note] Stalin Prize winner N. P. Okhlopkov is a famous Soviet People's Artist. He once very successfully played the worker Vasily in the films "Lenin in October" and "Lenin in 1918." In the film "Sverdlov," he played the singer Chaliapin; in the film "General Kutuzov," he played General Barclay. In 1948, he won the Stalin Prize for his achievements in playing the political commissar Vorobyov in the film "A Real Man." (Attached pictures)

	Communications engineer Daniya is about to set off with a hundred young League members to erect power lines in the forest. Chief Engineer Beridze is talking to her.

	Deputy Chief Engineer Alexei Kopsov (right) and Rogov (left), the head of the project area, realized the importance of the oil pipeline construction project after listening to Batmanov's words, and dispelled the idea of going to the front. Party Committee Secretary Zerkend (center) is also happy for them.

	Batmanov, the director of the Engineering Bureau, is very fond of the young League member Genka, but he now has to personally tell him an unfortunate message: Genka's father is dead.

    介绍影片“远离莫斯科的地方”
    庄为远
    原著者：伐·阿札耶夫编剧：姆·派派伐导演：阿列克桑德尔、斯托耳彼尔翻译：杨范莫斯科电影制片厂出品中央电影局上海电影制片厂译制
    根据苏联阿札耶夫的长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”改编的同名影片，保存了小说情节的中心线索和主要人物，通过远东艰险的自然背景，表现出苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中，如何把远东后方的重要工业部门的工作，改造得适应战争的需要。影片比较突出地表现出建设工程的领导者巴特曼诺夫的形象，描写了他的布尔什维克的领导艺术。
    影片集中了小说的戏剧冲突，首先表现出布尔什维克的领导者是处在严重困难的情况中。影片一开始，我们就看见巴特曼诺夫的全部领导工作，是处在千头万绪的极大困难面前。他面前不但有保守落后的前任总工程师格鲁布斯基等，正在因袭着资产阶级的设计观点，顽抗着国家建设工程的新要求；而且就在巴特曼诺夫自己所率领的战斗队伍中，也有人不理解建设远东石油管对卫国战争的重大意义，而认为跑到远东是“躲居在后方”，是逃避保卫祖国的责任，坚决要求脱离建设岗位到前线去。青年工程师阿列克塞最初的思想就是这样的。巴特曼诺夫的任务，是一方面要战胜保守、落后的思想，另方面要引导阿列克塞等的情绪，使他们对祖国的热情，转向到艰巨的建设工作上来。我们在影片中一开始看到，前任总工程师格鲁布斯基是如何对抗建设工程的新计划，他陈述了许多困难，许多理由，说明石油管的建设成功，绝不可能在一年内完成，而必需三年才能完成。他所说的困难是什么呢？是他认为在远东一年有七个月是冬季的严寒气候里，是根本无法施工的。他看不见苏维埃人民的创造力量是可以战胜这些困难的。而且他在设计工作中不重视与搜集充分的资料，忽视当地群众的正确建议，他认为在河流的左岸经常遭水泛滥，因此就盲目地肯定石油管敷设的线路必须设在右岸。但实际上河流的右岸有连绵不断的丘陵山脉，几乎没有一个村镇，建设线路的困难是很大的。而在左岸，线路不但可以沿着宽阔的大水淹不到的倾斜岸堤伸展，并可在敷设线路时得到当地居民的帮助。
    前任总工程师之所以看不到这些有利的条件，固执己见，是因为他不去实地勘查，在他的思想深处，还迷恋着资产阶级的技术观点。他的理论是以德国和美国的技术“权威”的意见为根据的。他不敢以革命精神，突破“全世界都还没有这样实验过”的技术规程。
    前任总工程师所提出的问题，在巴特曼诺夫面前摆着两条道路：或者是被资产阶级技术权威的观点所吓倒，罢手不做国家急需的建设石油管的工作；或者是以革命的精神，以社会主义的建设思想去战胜重重困难，把国家战时急需的石油开采出来，输送到前线去。
    巴特曼诺夫选择了后一道路，他在远离莫斯科数千里的后方，组织了“为了出产石油的战斗”。当他发现了在工程设计中，存在着两种尖锐的思想对立时，他以布尔什维克的原则精神，支持了新任总工程师别里捷所拟定的新的设计计划，批驳了格鲁布斯基的保守思想。巴特曼诺夫在工程的时间限制非常紧急的情势中，坚决勇敢地承担了祖国所给予的任务。我们在影片里的一场会议中，就能看见他是十分成熟和敏锐地对工程师们表示道：“老的计划书，难免是要修正或者改变的。”小说中关于建设线路的讨论，是这样写的，巴特曼诺夫肯定地说：“我们看见，我们知道，而且我们深信，新的技术方案是非常脚踏实地的，有根据的，是以计算和勘察为基础的，是以全体工程师的经验，不只是以别里捷个人的经验为基础的。”因此，巴特曼诺夫在此是十分自信地说道：“归根到底，我是第一个对你们大家和对建设工程的命运负责的人。我不怕担当由于我的决定而引起的后果的责任。”他说：“我曾经问过自己这个问题——在一年内敷设好输油管的问题是不是战时才发生的问题呢？还是三年的期限根本就不对？按我的意见，在任何情况下，敷设输油管花费那么长的时间都是不容许的，即使在战前，也不应该把线路敷设在右岸，而不考虑当地人民的利益和他们的帮助，不为尽量节省开支作打算。”
    这就是新旧两种设计方案的根本分歧：从巴特曼诺夫所领导的设计方案中，可以看出高度的政治思想内容，即由于敷设线路而开辟的大路，会在今后的长远的时期内有利于人民群众的生活。而思想保守的格鲁布斯基的工程观点不是以勘察为设计的基础，同时在建设事业中又不是将政治、经济与技术等问题联系起来进行考察。
    巴特曼诺夫在支持新的设计思想、反对保守落后的工程观点时，同时做的一件大事，是大力调整自己的队伍。巴特曼诺夫深信工程的开展是依靠群众的积极性，同时也随时善于用批评的方法，团结教育干部，带领着整个集体前进。我们在影片中看到巴特曼诺夫以极大的慈爱的心情和严格的遵守纪律的精神，把那种热望奔赴前线的副总工程师阿列克塞等爱国青年的全部激情，引向到建设工作上来。从影片的生动描写中，我们可以看到巴特曼诺夫是深入了他的干部的灵魂，不但了解他们，而且善于用恰当的方法，解开他们的思想结子。他灵活地运用了批评的武器，以他高尚的人格和对祖国、对斯大林的忠诚，感动了他的干部。在他身边聚集起群众的积极力量。
    巴特曼诺夫的领导还表现在掌握全面、深入重点，系统地检查指令的执行情况。他的工作作风既不是靠签署“命令”来进行“一般”的领导，也不是依赖于文书往返。在小说原著中，巴特曼诺夫曾对供应处长说：“我有一个规则，就是要亲自检查执行我的原则性的命令的情形。”他一方面掌握全面情况，一方面又进行具体领导。他像部署战斗的军事指挥员一样，特别看重通讯联络工作，以便随时和遥远的各个工程段联系，以便于指挥着建设工程的进行。
    当巴特曼诺夫一步也不放松地建立着自己的工作秩序时，我们看见他既熟练地掌握着工程的勘察、设计、输送建设器材和生活物资等工作的进行，又从不忘记去深入检查工作中的重点或薄弱的环节。在影片的最后我们看到巴特曼诺夫是用全力去突破海峡工程段的困难。在广阔冰冻的海峡上，采用了前辈工程师托波列夫的水底爆炸方法，巴特曼诺夫所率领的劳动大军获得了很大胜利。这一胜利，粉碎了格鲁布斯基认为不能在水底挖掘壕沟，敷设石油管的胡说。
    在工程进展中，群众的劳动热情，被组织在总工程师别里捷、阿列克塞与罗戈夫分别领导的三段工程核心的相互竞赛里。巴特曼诺夫与党委书记合作，引导着整个工程的进展，形成了战斗组织工作的灵魂。影片中巴特曼诺夫所领导的建设工程的胜利表现出社会主义设计思想的胜利，表现出工程全体建筑者爱国主义思想的威力。
    “远离莫斯科的地方”描写着建设工程中布尔什维克的领导艺术，同时，也集中地反映了朝气蓬勃的社会主义建设者的热情。影片通过了一些细致的生活侧面描写，表现了在遥远的后方所进行的建设工作，是与当时正在进行的战争血肉相关的。影片通过要求参加通讯队工作的孩子根卡父亲的牺牲，供应处长里别尔曼的家人被战争阻隔在列宁格勒，阿列克塞的妻子的牺牲的消息等等情节，表达出了人们在战争艰难时期中，政治上、情感上深切的一致。其中最为深刻感人的，就是巴特曼诺夫亲自告诉孩子根卡他父亲牺牲的那一场戏；这场戏很生动地描绘了巴特曼诺夫慈爱与豪迈的内心感情。影片也描写到别里捷、阿列克塞和托波列夫这两代工程师、党与非党的专家们之间正确友善的关系，反映了英雄建设事业的群众性。在这一伟大建设工程中涌现的群众英雄是不胜枚举的。影片突出地叙述了青年女工程师丹妮亚的通讯队的功绩，描写了青年们在暴风雪中艰苦工作的情景。
    配合全部故事，影片有着美丽的序曲与主题旋律，音乐对于影片中的自然环境有浓厚的抒情意味，使人们向往和热爱着远东的地方。同时，这部影片中有许多优秀的、成熟的苏联演员，和两位崭新的女演员（扮演丹妮亚的特·马霍娃与扮演然妮亚的伊·基谢列娃）参加演出。影片中的巴特曼诺夫的角色是由苏联著名演员奥赫洛普柯夫〔注〕扮演的。这位著名的演员在扮演巴特曼诺夫角色时，他的每一表演细节都经过了充分的情绪准备。他表演的情调，是用了全部内心蕴藏着的爱国情绪与鲜明的智慧，以及国家机关的高级指挥人员的慎重又果断的精神，在审视环境，听取反映，一面思索，一面判断。他的成功的表演，真实地显露出既含蓄又坚定的布尔什维克的领导形象。观众可以从他塑造的形象中感觉到谦逊和温暖，感觉到苏联共产党人在极艰难的环境中，完成伟大历史任务时的主动精神与激动心情。〔注〕斯大林奖金获得者恩·布·奥赫洛普柯夫，是著名的苏联人民演员，他曾经极为成功地在“列宁在十月”和“列宁在一九一八年”影片中扮演工人瓦西里。在“斯维尔德洛夫”影片里扮演歌唱家夏里亚宾；在“库图佐夫将军”影片里，扮演过巴尔克莱将军。一九四八年因在“真正的人”影片中扮演政治委员沃洛比约夫时的功绩，获得了斯大林奖金。（附图片）
