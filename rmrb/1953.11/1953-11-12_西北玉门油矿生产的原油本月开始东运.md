Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 11th: Crude oil produced by the Yumen Oil Mine in Northwest China has begun to be transported eastward in a steady stream from November, supplying refineries in Northeast and East China for processing into finished products.

Northwest China is rich in oil reserves, while refineries in Northeast and East China are refining crude oil purchased from abroad, sometimes having to suspend operations due to insufficient crude oil supply; a large amount of finished petroleum products used domestically must also be imported from abroad. This is a deformed state of economic dependence left over from old China.

This large-scale eastward transport of crude oil from the Yumen Oil Mine in the Northwest to the Northeast across a 3,000-kilometer transportation line is an unprecedented event in our country's history, marking the increasing development of our country's industrial construction.

Preparations for the eastward transport of crude oil from the Yumen Oil Mine in Northwest China have been underway for more than a year. In the process of preparation, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic supplied a large number of tanker trucks for transporting crude oil; the workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway accelerated the construction of railway sidings; highway workers repaired roads and bridges to ensure the smooth passage of tanker trucks; and the Northwest Petroleum Industry Department trained drivers for transport trucks.

On November 1st, the Yumen Oil Mine held a celebration rally for the eastward transport of crude oil. At the meeting, Kang Shi'en, Director of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, asked the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine to strive to improve the level of oil extraction and supply a large amount of crude oil for eastward transport; he asked transportation personnel to take good care of locomotives and cherish every drop of precious oil, ensuring the complete fulfillment of the eastward transport task. After Director Kang Shi'en cut the ribbon, dozens of large tanker trucks slowly drove out of the crude oil eastward transport station. From then on, these large tanker trucks traveled day and night in double shifts along the highway to Dachaigou, continuously loading crude oil onto trains.

    西北玉门油矿生产的原油本月开始东运
    【新华社西安十一日电】西北玉门油矿生产的原油，从十一月份起已开始源源东运，供应东北和华东的炼油厂炼制成品。
    西北石油蕴藏丰富，而东北和华东的炼油厂却炼着从国外买来的原油，有时因原油供应不足还要停工待料；国内用的大量石油成品又必须从国外输入。这是旧中国遗留下来的经济不独立的畸形状态。
    这次玉门油矿的原油从祖国的西北到东北三千公里长的运输线上，大量东运，是我国历史上的创举，它标志着我国工业建设的日益发展。
    西北玉门油矿原油东运工作已作了一年多的筹备。在筹备过程中，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国供应了大批运输原油用的油罐卡车；修筑兰新铁路的职工加速修好了铁路岔道；公路职工修整了公路和桥梁，为让油罐卡车通行无阻；西北石油工业部门并培养了运输汽车的司机。
    十一月一日，玉门油矿举行了原油东运庆祝大会。会上，中央人民政府燃料工业部石油管理总局局长康世恩要求玉门油矿职工努力提高采油工作水平，大量供应东运的原油；要求运输人员爱护机车，爱护每滴珍贵的石油，保证全部完成东运任务。康世恩局长剪彩后，几十辆大油罐车就徐徐开出原油东运站。从此以后，这些大油罐车就沿着公路，日夜双班地行驶到打柴沟，把原油源源不绝地装上火车。
