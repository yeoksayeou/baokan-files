    The increase production and practice economy competition campaign in the Tianjin State-owned Trade System has basically entered an in-depth stage. The import and export tasks for October were all exceeded, with sales tasks completed at 115.84% and import tasks completed at 121.69%.
    The units participating in this competition campaign include: eight central purchasing and supply stations and seventeen sales city companies, encompassing over 14,200 employees.
    The reasons for exceeding the competition plan are: First, fully mobilize the masses and give play to their initiative. At the beginning of the campaign, all units universally conducted ideological mobilization, enabling the vast number of employees to recognize the significant meaning of increasing production and practicing economy for national construction, thereby actively seeking methods and finding tricks, which is the main force for completing and exceeding tasks. For example, when formulating plans at the beginning of the campaign, the original plans were mostly conservative, but after serious discussion by the masses, they became much larger. The Tianjin Central Station of China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company proposed saving 300 million yuan in commodity circulation costs, but after discussion by the masses, it was found that transportation costs alone could save 600 million yuan. In terms of vigorous sales promotion, advanced methods such as warehouse commodity queuing, commodity-customer interaction, processing and modifying slow-selling commodities and re-packaging them, simplifying procedures to facilitate customers, and changing business styles were further clarified or created, turning many unsalable cold goods into hot goods. For example, after commodity queuing, the Tianjin Central Station of China Hardware and Machinery Company clarified that 13 heavy rods worth 570 million yuan, whose purpose was unclear in the past, were for drilling and promoted their sale. The Timber Company improved the method of buying and selling timber, greatly facilitating farmers' purchases. In terms of saving expenses, most adopted direct transportation and on-site distribution methods, improved packaging, reduced commodity damage rates, and saved circulation expenses. For example, the Tianjin Central Station of China General Merchandise Company adopted on-site delivery from the port, saving over 140 million yuan in transportation costs at one time. Second, using the method of subject competition to concentrate the wisdom of the vast number of employees to solve key issues in work. This is much better than generally calling on employees to put forward rationalization proposals in the past. For example, the Receiving and Storage Section of the Tianjin Central Station of China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company, based on the station's main task of vigorously exceeding the supply task to serve the sales company, repeatedly discussed by the masses, checked out the shortcomings in the past receiving and inspection work, and proposed that the Receiving and Storage Section should achieve "fast receiving, fast inspection, fast dispatch, and fast transportation," concentrating the wisdom of more than 90 people in the section on "four fasts," creating flow-line operation methods and other inspection methods, improving work efficiency, and solving the problem of commodities not being able to be transferred out in time. Third, strengthening the Party's leadership over the trade system is the most fundamental and decisive factor in ensuring the victory of increasing production and practicing economy. The Party centrally and unifiedly led the movement, and the Party branches have basically formed the leading core of each company. The company's administrative planning indicators and important decisions must be carefully discussed by the branch committee, and decisions are made based on the specific situation of the unit and policy principles. Through convening expanded branch committee meetings for discussion and deployment, the Party's groups combined with League members to unite activists and drive the masses of the entire unit. At the same time, ideological leadership was strengthened, and three ideological issues were mainly grasped during the movement. When deploying and mobilizing, the prevention of capitalist business ideology was proposed; in the early stage of the movement, the backward and conservative thinking of some leading cadres was criticized through mass discussions of plans; after the movement had been launched, it was proposed that leading cadres should go deep into business units to oppose bureaucracy. Because ideological work was grasped tightly, the movement was able to develop healthily. Fourth, the Party Committee of the Tianjin State-owned Trade System of the CPC and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Commerce took necessary measures, which played a certain role in the movement. For example, in terms of business, methods such as commodity queuing were proposed in a timely manner; companies with insufficient sources of goods were actively instructed to seize the import of goods. In order to specifically help the work of each unit, the trade system party committee and the Bureau of Commerce jointly organized nine inspection teams, led by the section chiefs of the bureau and the ministers of the party committee, to go deep down to specifically help the lower levels and to understand the situation in a timely manner. Fifth, maintaining good relations with all parties has greatly helped the work. For example, under the direct leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the Tianjin Trade System maintained good relations with the Railway Bureau and the Transport Company, solving the biggest difficulties in transportation. Banks and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce also provided great support.
    Judging from the situation during this period: the leadership of the movement is not strong enough, and sometimes it cannot keep up with the development of the movement. The development of the movement is uneven, with a few units not completing the task, and individual units completing it very poorly.
    Therefore, in the future, we must resolutely implement the Party's policies, vigorously promote sales, and strive to exceed the sales promotion task. The leadership must quickly summarize sales promotion experience, universally check whether the price list is reasonable, and whether the wholesale starting point is in line with policies and conducive to sales promotion. At the same time, it is necessary to promptly propose preventing complacency and relaxation, as well as the occurrence of simple task viewpoints and capitalist business ideology.

    天津市国营贸易系统增产节约运动深入展开
    十月份进销任务全部超额完成
    天津市国营贸易系统的增产节约竞赛运动，基本上已进入深入阶段。十月份进销任务都超额完成，其中销货任务完成百分之一百十五点八四，进货任务完成百分之一百二十一点六九。
    这次参加竞赛运动的单位有：八个中央采购供应站和十七个销货市公司，包括一万四千二百多个职工。
    超额完成竞赛计划的原因是：一、充分发动群众，发挥群众的积极性。在运动开始时，各单位就普遍地进行了思想动员，使广大职工认识到增产节约对祖国建设的重大意义，从而积极想办法、找窍门，这是完成和超额完成任务的主要力量。如在运动之初订计划时，原来提出的计划大多是保守的，经群众认真讨论后就要大得多。中国交通电工器材公司天津中央站领导上提出节约商品流转费用三亿元，经群众讨论后只运费一项即可节约六亿元。在大力推销方面，进一步明确了或创造了仓库商品排队、商品和顾客见面、滞销商品经过加工改制与重改包装、简化手续便利顾客、改变经营作风等先进的方法，把不少推销不出去的冷货变成了热货。如中国五金机械公司天津中央站经过商品排队，把过去弄不清用途的价值五亿七千万元的重杆十三根，弄清是作钻探用的，就推销出去了。木材公司改进了买卖木材的办法，大大便利农民买货。在节约费用方面，大多采用直接运输和就地分发的办法，改善包装，降低商品伤耗率，节省了流转费用。如中国百货公司天津中央站采用了港口就地发货，一次节省了运费一亿四千多万元。二、用课题竞赛的方法集中广大职工的智慧来解决工作上的关键问题。这样比过去一般地号召职工提合理化建议要好得多。如中国交通电工器材公司天津中央站接储科根据站的大力超额完成供应任务为销货公司服务的主要任务，经群众反复讨论，检查出过去接验工作中的缺点，提出接储科要作到“快接、快验、快发、快运”，把全科九十多人的智慧都集中到“四快”上来，创造了流水作业法等多种验货方法，提高了工作效率，解决了商品不能及时调出去的问题。三、加强党对贸易系统的领导，是保证增产节约胜利的最基本的决定因素。党集中统一地领导了运动，党的支部已基本上形成各公司的领导核心。公司行政上的计划指标与重要的决定，都要经过支委会的认真讨论，并根据本单位的具体情况及政策原则作出决定。通过召开扩大支委会讨论布置，以党的小组结合团员团结积极分子，带动整个单位的群众。同时，加强思想领导，在运动中主要抓住了三个思想问题。在布置动员时，提出了防止资本主义经营思想；在运动的初期，以群众讨论计划的积极行动批判了部分领导干部的落后保守思想；在运动已经展开后，提出领导干部要深入营业单位，反对官僚主义。由于思想工作抓得较紧，因而运动得以健康发展。四、中共天津市国营贸易系统党委会和天津市商业局采取了必要的措施，对运动起了一定作用。如在业务上及时提出了进行商品排队等办法；积极指示某些货源不足的公司抓紧进货。为了具体地帮助各单位工作，贸易系统党委和商业局共同组织了九个检查组，由局里的科长和党委的部长亲自带领深入下去，具体帮助下级，并及时了解情况。五、和各方面搞好关系，对工作帮助很大，如在中共天津市委会和市财政经济委员会的直接领导下，天津市贸易系统和铁路局、搬运公司搞好关系，解决了运输上的最大困难，银行和工商局也给了很大支持。
    根据这一时期情况来看：运动的领导还不够强，有时还不能跟上运动的发展。运动的发展不平衡，有少数单位没有完成任务，个别单位完成得很差。
    为此，今后必须在坚决执行党的政策下，大力推销，争取超额完成推销任务。领导上必须迅速总结推销经验，普遍检查牌价是否合理，批发起点是否合乎政策与有利推销。同时要及时提出防止自满情绪和松一口气的思想以及单纯的任务观点和资本主义经营思想的发生。
