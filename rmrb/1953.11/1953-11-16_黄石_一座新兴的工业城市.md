　　Huangshi – An Emerging Industrial City
　　By our reporter Cao Baoming
　　In the old society, the formation of a city often required decades, even centuries; but in the new China, I have personally witnessed a city grow from two villages and towns in just four short years – this is Huangshi City in Hubei Province, on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

　　A New City by the Yangtze River
　　This is a very desirable heavy industrial area. Looking from afar, many chimneys of all sizes are emitting black and white, dense smoke clouds. The eight huge circular warehouses of the Huaxin Cement Company stand like giants, with iron buckets rolling on long aerial cableways. Further away from the docks is the famous Daye Steel Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company. If you arrive here at night, you will see such a brilliant scene: around the factory buildings and along the roads, lights are brightly lit everywhere. Looking far away through the night fog on the river, these fifteen or sixteen *li* of lights are even brighter than the Milky Way. When the molten iron is tapped, the white-hot liquid iron shines brightly, reddening a corner of the sky.

　　This city was just the two villages of Shihuiyao and Huangshigang under the jurisdiction of Daye County four years ago. When I first came here in the spring of 1951, it only had one avenue that could barely accommodate vehicles. Now, not only have some of the mountains that hindered the development of the urban area been leveled, but the original avenue has been widened, and new roads are being built. Brand-new buses are already running in the city. In the past, transportation here was very inconvenient. People were crammed into small steamers like dried fish from Hankou to here. Now, medium-sized liners and large buses run between Wuchang and Huangshi every day, and large ships of thousands of tons on the Hanshen Line also dock here every other day. Previously, this place relied only on some private merchants to transport goods from Hankou for sale. Now, bustling streets and factories and mines have established state-owned trading companies and cooperatives with spacious shops, continuously transporting a large number of goods with various colors and cheap prices from all over the country. In the past three years, 167,000 square meters of new houses have been built here (excluding factory buildings). This year, the city is still building 100,000 square meters of houses. Next year, the Central China Iron and Steel Company will build 5,000 employee dormitories here. Huangshi City has become a cultured city in just a few years. Now it has sixteen primary schools, one middle school, a technical workers' school, a geological school, and a nursing school; hospitals, cinemas, and theaters have also been built one after another. Currently, a lakeside park is being built in the scenic and evergreen Zhangjia Lake-Tuancheng Mountain area.

　　Painful Memories
　　Huangshi City could not even be found on maps published two years ago; however, it has long been known throughout the country for its industry. In the past, people called it "Daye."

　　This was originally the location of the Daye Mine of the Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company. In the current Daye Steel Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company, one can still see tall overpasses and relics such as the destroyed blast furnace foundations. Everyone knows that the Hanyeping Company was China's earliest and largest iron and steel industry. In Hanyang, there were originally four blast furnaces, seven open-hearth furnaces, and various equipment for rolling steel rails, steel beams, steel plates, and steel bars. In 1926, two 450-ton blast furnaces, the largest in the country at the time, were built at the Daye Mine. At its peak, it mined 700,000 tons of ore annually. If it could have continued to develop on this basis, the current achievements would have been imaginable. However, what the people took over here at the time of liberation was a "steel company" that produced neither steel nor iron.

　　During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, its traitorous and anti-people policies led to the cruel plundering of this industrial base by imperialism. As early as the late Qing Dynasty, imperialist countries sent many "experts" to Tieshan to "prospect." In 1913, Japanese imperialism took advantage of the Hanyeping Company's lack of funds and difficulties in selling steel to sign a "contract" with the company for a small so-called "advance payment," stipulating that it would supply Japan with 8 million tons of pig iron and 15 million tons of iron ore within forty years. If it could not deliver pig iron on time, it would offset it with iron ore. According to this calculation, the required iron ore was almost equal to all the mineral deposits found in Tieshan at that time, tantamount to giving the entire Tieshan to Japan. In 1915, the Japanese bandits colluded with the traitor Yuan Shikai to propose the "Twenty-One Demands," further carrying out aggression against the Hanyeping Company as a "Sino-Japanese cooperative enterprise." Although these were unanimously opposed by the Chinese people, Japan still used various means to cause the Hanyeping Company to suffer heavy plunder. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese bandits transported away 12 million tons of iron ore; and dismantled many smelting equipment (including five blast furnaces) in Hanyang and here that had not been moved. What was left when the Japanese surrendered were only one blast furnace (which had been dismantled), some mining equipment, and ore that could not be transported away in time.

　　The New Birth of "Daye"
　　It is difficult to restore and develop production on such a dilapidated foundation. But the hardworking and brave people were not intimidated by the difficulties. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they quickly rebuilt this industrial base with their own hands. The smoke clouds, which symbolize the beating pulse of industrial production, float over Huangshi City day and night again.

　　In the past few years, Huangshi City has been supporting the country's economic construction with constantly increasing industrial production. The cement produced by Huaxin Cement Company in a single day can be used to build more than 36,000 square meters of all reinforced concrete five-story buildings. In addition to supplying the power and smelting needs of various factories and mines in Huangshi City, the Daye Power Plant also undertakes the electricity consumption of many factories in Wuhan City through nearly 300 *li* of high-voltage power lines. In the "Finished Products Warehouse" square of the Daye Steel Plant, tens of thousands of tons of steel ingots and steel bars are piled up from the rolling mill to the riverbank, and cold-cast wheels, each stacked higher than a person, occupy a large area. Workers are constantly moving them out from morning to night.

　　Huangshi City once supported a series of great construction projects such as harnessing the Huai River, flood diversion in Jingjiang, reinforcing the Yellow River Railway Bridge, and expanding the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Now it continues to support many factories, mines, and national defense construction projects. At the celebration of this year's National Day, the employees of each factory and mine raised large charts, using numbers to express their determination: to launch a labor competition for the plan to increase production and practice economy by 140 billion yuan, and to support the country's first five-year construction plan with more and better steel, cement, electricity, and coal.

　　The reason why Huangshi City has become an industrial base in our country is that it is a treasure house with extremely rich underground resources. As early as forty years ago, it was famous in the world for its high-quality and abundant iron ore. It also has limestone, an indispensable raw material for smelting pig iron and manufacturing cement, as well as firewood and coal for daily use. According to recent surveys, it also contains manganese, which is indispensable for smelting high-quality steel, and a certain non-ferrous metal that is extremely important in modern industry. The value of this metal is equivalent to the sum of all the iron ore in the Tieshan mining area.

　　Tieshan, which had been silent for more than six years, is active again. When I first went to Tieshan in the spring of 1951, there were still scars left by the Japanese plunder everywhere. Now, towering triangular scaffolding is arranged from the top of the mountain to the foot, and many electric wires are connected along the road leading up the mountain. Industrial construction vanguards from all over the country – geologists and drilling workers – are busy in the overlapping mountains of the Tieshan mining area, regardless of wind, rain, cold, and heat. They will survey the underground resources in the area of ​​more than 1,300 square kilometers centered on Tieshan, and calculate the reserves and grades.

　　The people of Huangshi City are very concerned about this great construction plan. Every time I went from Daye Steel Plant to Tieshan, I heard a lot of discussions. Some said: "Our railway will soon be connected to Wuchang. From now on, we can take the train to Hankou to play every Saturday night." Some said: "That's nothing. In the future, factories will be built along the 300 *li* road between Huangshi and Wuhan, connecting these two places into one. At that time, we will be considered to be working in Wuhan City." People enrich this plan with their own imagination.

　　黄石——一座新兴的工业城市
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    在旧社会里，一个城市的形成往往需要几十年，甚至几百年；而在新中国，我却亲眼看见一个城市在短短的四年中，由两个村镇成长起来——这便是长江南岸的湖北省黄石市。
    长江边上的一座新城市
    这是一个非常让人向往的重工业区。远远望去许多大大小小的烟囱，正冒着黑白、浓密的烟云。华新水泥公司的八个巨大的圆形仓库巨人似的矗立着，铁斗在漫长的空中缆道上滚动着。离码头较远的地方是著名的华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂。如果黑夜到达这里，你会看到多么灿烂的景色：厂房周围公路两旁，到处灯光辉煌，透过江上的夜雾远远地望去，这十五、六里路长的灯火比天上的银河还要明朗。出铁的时候，白热的铁液光芒四射，照红了天空的一角。
    这个城市，四年前还是大冶县所属的石灰窑与黄石港两个村镇，一九五一年春天，我初到这里的时候，它只有一条可以勉强通行车辆的大道，现在不仅部分阻碍市区发展的山头被削平了，原来的大道加宽了，并兴建着新的公路，市里已经往来奔驰着崭新的公共汽车。原来这里与外面的交通很不方便，从汉口到这里，人们像堆干鱼似的挤在小火轮里，现在每天有短航的中型班轮和大型汽车往来于武昌、黄石之间，汉申线的几千吨大轮船，也隔天一次在这里靠岸。以前这里仅靠一些私商从汉口贩运点货物来销售，现在热闹的街上和厂矿里，设立了铺面开阔的国营贸易公司和合作社，源源不断地从各地运来了货色繁多、价钱便宜的大批物资。三年来，这里新建的房屋（不包括厂房）有十六万七千多平方公尺。今年市内还在修建十万平方公尺的房屋。明年华中钢铁公司将在这里修起五千户职工宿舍。黄石市几年之间，已经变成一个有文化的城市了。现在它有小学十六所、中学、技术工人学校、地质学校、护士学校各一所；医院、电影院、戏院也陆续兴建起来了。目前在风景优美、四季常绿的张家湖——团城山一带正修建着湖心公园。
    沉痛的回忆
    黄石市，两年前出版的地图上，还找不到它的名字；然而它却很早便以自己的工业著名全国，以前人们都叫它为“大冶”。
    这里原来是汉冶萍煤铁公司大冶矿厂所在地。现在的华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂里还能见到高大的天桥和破坏了的高炉底座等遗迹。谁都知道汉冶萍公司是我国最早最大的钢铁工业。在汉阳，原有四座高炉、七座平炉和轧制钢轨、钢梁、钢板、钢条的各种设备。一九二六年，又在大冶矿厂修建两座为当时全国最大的四百五十吨的高炉。最盛的时期，它每年开采矿石达七十万吨。如果能在这个基础上继续发展，现在的成就是可以想见的。但是，解放时人民在这里接管到的，却是一个既不出钢又不出铁的“钢铁公司”。
    在国民党反动统治时代，由于它的卖国反人民的政策，曾招致了帝国主义对这个工业基地残酷的掠夺。远在满清年间，帝国主义国家便曾派来许多“专家”来铁山“勘察”，一九一三年日本帝国主义，趁汉冶萍公司资金不足和钢材销售困难的机会，以很少的所谓“预付价款”与公司订立“合同”，规定在四十年内供给日本八百万吨生铁和一千五百万吨铁矿，如果不能按期交付生铁，即以铁矿折抵，这样计算起来，所需的铁矿几乎等于当时在铁山发现的所有矿藏量，无异将铁山全部送给日本。一九一五年，日本强盗勾结卖国贼袁世凯订立的“二十一条约”中，又提出将汉冶萍公司作为“中日合作事业”进一步进行侵略。这些，虽然都遭到我国人民的一致反对，但是日本仍然用了各种手段，使汉冶萍公司遭受了惨重的掠夺。抗日战争期间，日本强盗先后运走了一千二百万吨铁矿；并将汉阳与这里的许多没有迁走的冶炼设备（五座高炉在内）全部拆除，到日寇投降时所遗留下来的，只是来不及运走的一座高炉（已拆掉了的）、一些开采设备和矿石。
    “大冶”的新生
    在这样残破的基础上来恢复和发展生产，是有重重困难的。但是勤劳勇敢的人们并没有被困难吓倒，在共产党领导下，用自己的双手，很快便把这个工业基地重新建设起来。标志着工业生产脉搏跳动的烟云，又日夜浮动在黄石市的上空。
    几年来，黄石市以不断增长的工业生产来支援着祖国的经济建设。单是华新水泥公司一天出产的水泥便可以用来修建全部钢筋混凝土的五层楼房三万六千多平方公尺。大冶电厂除了供应黄石市各厂矿的动力和熔炼等需要外，还要通过近三百里地的高压电线，担负着武汉市许多工厂的用电。在大冶钢厂的“成品库”广场上，上万吨的钢锭和钢条从轧钢车间一直堆到江边，一个个重叠起来比人还高的冷铸车轮占了很大一片场地，工人们从早到晚不停地往外搬运。
    黄石市曾经支援了根治淮河、荆江分洪、加固黄河大铁桥和扩建鞍山钢铁公司等一系列伟大的建设工程，现在还是继续不断地支援着许多工厂、矿山和国防建设事业。在庆祝今年国庆节的大会上，各厂矿的职工都抬着大幅的图表，用数字表示出自己的决心：为增产节约一千四百亿元的计划展开劳动竞赛，以更多更好的钢铁、水泥、电力和煤炭，支援祖国的第一个五年建设。
    黄石市之所以成为我国的一个工业基地，是由于它是我国的一个宝库，有着极丰富的地下资源。早在四十年以前，它便以品质优良、藏量丰富的铁矿著名于世界。它还有冶炼生铁和制造水泥不可缺少的原料——石灰石，以及日用的柴煤。据最近调查，它还蕴藏着冶炼优质钢不可缺少的锰和现代工业上极为重要的某种有色金属，这种金属的价值相当于铁山矿区全部铁矿的总和。
    沉寂了六年多的铁山又活跃起来了。一九五一年春天我第一次到铁山去时，四处都还呈现着日寇掠夺后的伤痕。现在，从山顶到山脚都排列着高耸的三角棚架，沿着上山的道路牵上了许多电线。来自全国各地的工业建设先锋队——地质人员和钻探工人，不顾风雨、寒暑地在这山峦重叠的铁山矿区忙碌着。他们要在以铁山为中心的一千三百多平方公里的地区里查明地下的资源，并计算出藏量和品位来。
    黄石市的人们对这个伟大的建设计划是非常关心的。我每次从大冶钢厂到铁山去的途中，都听到很多的议论。有的说：“我们的铁路很快就要通到武昌去了，以后每个星期六晚上都可以搭火车到汉口去玩。”有的说：“这不算什么。将来沿着我们黄石与武汉三百里地的路上，全要建立工厂，把这两个地方连成一片。那时候，我们就算在武汉市工作了。”人们用自己的想像把这个计划丰富起来了。
