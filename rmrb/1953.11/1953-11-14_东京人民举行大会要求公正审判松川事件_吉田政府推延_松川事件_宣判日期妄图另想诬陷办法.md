　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Tokyo: People from all walks of life in Tokyo held a "Demand a Fair Trial in the Matsukawa Incident, Uphold Freedom and Human Rights" rally at the Kyobashi Public Hall on the afternoon of the 2nd. About 1,000 people attended. Attendees unanimously opposed the conspiracy to unreasonably postpone the verdict date of the "Matsukawa Incident."

　　After the rally began, Yoshimura, a member of the Central Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, gave an investigation report on the "Matsukawa Incident." Yoshimura's report emphasized that, to date, the investigation into the "Matsukawa Incident" has not found any evidence that could determine the guilt of the defendants. The chief lawyer reported to the conference on the trial process since the first instance, exposing the collusion between the court and the Yoshida government's prosecutor's office, their acts of collusion and fabrication of evidence.

　　The conference also heard accusations from Nikaido Sonoko, who was released on bail due to illness, and the mother of defendant Takeda Hisashi, and read aloud a public letter from defendant Sugiura Saburo from prison, as well as a recorded speech by famous Japanese film actress Isuzu Yamada.

　　The conference finally passed four resolutions, including demanding a fair verdict for the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

　　According to Xinhua News Agency: The Sendai High Court, which is trying the "Matsukawa Incident," announced on October 28th without reason: The sentencing date of the second instance of the "Matsukawa Incident" will be postponed from the original November 5th to December 22nd. The reason for the postponement is that the US-Japan reactionaries, given that their conspiracy to frame Japanese patriotic workers by creating the "Matsukawa Incident" has been exposed, all the "charges" and "evidence" they attempted to use as the basis for the verdict cannot stand, and therefore they are attempting to delay the time to devise new framing methods.

　　This new conspiracy of the Yoshida government was immediately met with a serious protest from all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." In a statement issued on the day the postponement of the verdict was announced, they pointed out: Now, the Japanese reactionaries are going to further oppress the Japanese people to accept the US Mutual Security Agency's "aid," unscrupulously carry out false and deceptive propaganda, and the special agent organizations are increasingly strengthened, and democratic freedom is suffering persecution. Announcing the postponement of the verdict at this time makes us feel infinite anger. In the two-year process of the second trial, the facts have proved that we are innocent. Since this is the case, there is no reason why the verdict cannot be pronounced on November 5, the verdict date decided by the court itself. The statement pointed out: This postponement of the verdict, like the first trial, is because they are afraid of exposing their conspiracy. This postponement shows that the court has overturned its own promise, and it also shows that the court has unreasonably kept us in prison for a long time, fearing that the truth will be revealed to the world.

　　Many groups have protested the postponement of the verdict and demanded the release of all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The Japan National Relief Association issued a statement saying: The decision to postpone the verdict completely violates the expectations of fair trial of this case by good people all over Japan and the world.

    东京人民举行大会要求公正审判松川事件
    吉田政府推延“松川事件”宣判日期妄图另想诬陷办法
      【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：东京各界人民于二日下午在京桥公会堂举行了“要求公正审判松川事件、维护自由与人权”大会。到会的约一千多人。与会者一致反对无理推延“松川事件”判决日期的阴谋。
    大会开始后，国营铁道工会中央斗争委员会委员吉村作了关于“松川事件”的调查报告。吉村的报告着重地说明：迄今为止，对“松川事件”的调查并没有发现任何一件能够断定被告有罪的证据。主任律师当场向大会报告了初审以来的审判经过，暴露了裁判所和吉田政府检察厅串通一气、狼狈为奸和捏造证据的情形。
    大会还听取了因病保释的二阶堂园子和被告武田久的母亲的控诉，并宣读了被告杉浦三郎从狱中寄来的公开信以及日本著名电影演员山田五十铃的录音讲话。
    大会最后通过要求公正判决“松川事件”被告等四项决议。
    据新华社讯：审判“松川事件”的仙台高等裁判所毫无理由地在十月二十八日宣布：“松川事件”第二审的宣判日期，从原定的十一月五日延迟到十二月二十二日。延期的原因，是由于美日反动派鉴于他们制造“松川事件”诬陷日本爱国工人的阴谋已被揭露，所有企图用作判决的根据的“罪状”和
  “证据”已站不住脚，因此企图拖延时间，另想诬陷办法。
    吉田政府的这一新的阴谋，立即遭到“松川事件”全体被告的严重抗议。他们在被宣布延期判决的当天发表声明指出：现在，日本反动派正要进一步压迫日本人民接受美国共同安全署“援助”，肆无忌惮地进行虚伪和欺骗宣传，特务组织日益加强，民主自由横遭迫害。在这个时期宣布延期判决，使我们不能不感到无限的愤怒。在历时两年的第二审过程中，事实已经证明我们是无辜的。既然如此，在裁判所自己决定的十一月五日判决日不能宣判，是没有理由的。声明指出：这次延期宣判就像第一审时那样，这是他们害怕暴露出他们的阴谋。这种延期，表明裁判所推翻了自己所作的诺言，同时也表明裁判所无理地把我们长期关在狱中，是害怕真相大白于天下。
    许多团体都抗议延期宣判，要求释放“松川事件”全体被告。日本国民救援会发表声明说：延期宣判的决定，完全违反日本全国和全世界的善良人民对这个案件进行公正审判的期待。
