Testimony of Lieutenant John G. Aerlis, Pilot of the 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, US Air Force

I am John G. Aerlis, Lieutenant in the US Air Force, service number AO—1862790, formerly residing at 2026 Stuart Street, Richmond, Virginia.

Before joining the Air Force in November 1950, I worked as an engineer at DuPont. After joining the Air Force, I was first assigned to Connally Air Force Base in Texas for basic pilot training, and then to Williams Air Force Base in Arizona for advanced jet aircraft training. After graduating there in December 1951, I was sent to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for F-80 and F-86 combat training, between January and February 1952, before going to Korea.

From May 1st to July 20th, when I was shot down and captured, I flew four bacteriological warfare missions, two to China and two to North Korea. In all these missions, the insects were carried in containers resembling external fuel tanks.

Around May 1, 1952, when I participated in the group's fifth mission, my flight leader was notified to report before dawn to receive an early morning briefing. The four of us reported to the combat operations briefing room, where we were met by Lieutenant Lidland, the group's intelligence officer, and the meteorology officer. Lieutenant Lidland told us that our planes would carry one fuel tank and one fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb, containing fleas infected with bubonic plague. He told us to cross the Yalu River into China and drop these fuel tanks (auxiliary fuel tanks and fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bombs) together in an area between Andong and Dadonggou. Lieutenant Lidland told us that if we encountered MiG aircraft, we should drop the fuel tanks together, accelerate, and return as quickly as possible.

We returned to the squadron quarters, where the flight leader briefly discussed his flight path, flying west of Zhennampo and then north across the sea to avoid the area where MiG aircraft usually flew, and then entering the land air over the “Langdong” (transliteration) Peninsula. He told us to turn left at Sinuiju in a northeast to southwest direction, crossing the Andong and Dadonggou airfields, and then fly back to the sea, returning to base along the original route. We took off about twenty minutes before dawn. We flew north over the sea and turned towards Sinuiju when we reached the “Langdong” Peninsula. We circled Sinuiju and began to turn left and dive. About three miles from Andong, I dropped the fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb and the auxiliary fuel tank. It was a few minutes after sunrise. As I flew out of Northeast China into the Yellow Sea, I glimpsed the mouth of the Yalu River. We flew over Zhennampo and returned to K-14 base.

About a week later, around May 8th, six pilots from the 336th Squadron were scheduled to report to combat operations at 1:00 PM that day to receive a briefing. When we arrived, personnel from four flights from other squadrons had already arrived. Lieutenant Lidland briefed that today was a MiG aircraft search patrol mission, and friendly aircraft from the 51st Fighter Group would enter North Korea one hour after we did. Furthermore, there were no other friendly aircraft in the same area. He then said that the aircraft of the 336th Squadron (my squadron) would also carry fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bombs containing infected insects to carry out a bacteriological warfare mission. Four of the six aircraft would carry one fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb and one auxiliary fuel tank, giving them enough fuel to patrol north of the Chongchon River. The remaining two aircraft (including mine) would carry two fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bombs on each aircraft, and after dropping the fuel tanks, would make a short circuit along the Chongchon River before returning to Gimpo. He ordered the four-aircraft flight and the two-aircraft base team to drop the fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bombs and auxiliary fuel tanks simultaneously northeast of Zhennampo. We dropped our fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bombs about five miles northeast of Zhennampo. When we reached the Chongchon River, we turned left towards the mouth of the river and returned to K-14 base.

Around May 23rd, our flight was assigned to report in the morning with about six flights from other squadrons to receive a briefing. In the combat operations briefing room, Lieutenant Lidland issued a briefing saying that aircraft from the 49th and 8th Fighter-Bomber Groups would attack a railway line ten miles northeast of Pyongyang, and our group's mission was to patrol to protect the fighter-bombers from MiG aircraft attacks. Lieutenant Lidland also said that my own flight would also carry out bacteriological warfare missions while patrolling. He said that our aircraft would each carry one fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb and one auxiliary fuel tank, both of which would be dropped at the midpoint between Sinanju and Anju. We took off at 11:00 and some minutes, and dropped the fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb and the auxiliary fuel tank simultaneously at the midpoint between Sinanju and Anju. Then we turned left and began patrolling between the mouth of the Chongchon River and Zhennampo. After returning to base, the flight leader reported to combat operations.

The last bacteriological warfare mission I carried out around June 10th, which also crossed the Yalu River into China, differed mainly in that the briefing was given by Colonel Tyne, the group commander, and Lieutenant Lidland.

After assigning areas and altitudes to all flights, Colonel Tyne told all the flights (except my flight) to retain the auxiliary fuel tanks unless they saw MiG aircraft. He ended the briefing, and my flight leader went to the front of the briefing room to listen to Lieutenant Lidland's instructions, while the rest of us returned to our squadron. About ten minutes later, he returned and said that we were to carry one auxiliary fuel tank and one fuel tank-shaped bacteriological bomb, and that these fuel tanks were to be dropped north of the Yalu River in Northeast China, above the Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Plant. While flying towards the target, some units of the 51st Wing engaged MiG aircraft in combat. When we flew over the Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Plant, two of our flights had slight contact with MiG aircraft, with no results. But we did not encounter MiG aircraft. We crossed the Yalu River at the east end of the power plant, reducing altitude and increasing speed. Although we did not see MiG aircraft, MiG aircraft were already overhead, so I and the other wingmen paid little attention to the terrain and closely watched above and behind to guard against possible attacks. Our fear was increased by the knowledge that we had entered China. When we dropped the bacteriological bomb and the auxiliary fuel tank seven or eight miles south of Kuandian in Northeast China, we were flying west. Then, we made a sharp left turn and crossed the Yalu River again, and made a short patrol south of the power plant, then flew back past the south of the "Langdong" Peninsula and flew back to base along the coast.

This is the complete account of my personal involvement in bacteriological warfare. Before carrying out my first mission, I had received detailed instructions on what to expect when flying F-86 aircraft in Korea. Around February 20, 1952, when I was at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, Major McEntire, the ground school commander, gave us a top-secret lesson in the ground school theater, which only F-86 aircraft pilot trainees were allowed to attend. Major McEntire first emphasized the top-secret nature of this lesson and ordered that it should never be discussed after leaving the classroom. He said that the purpose of bacteriological warfare was not to directly destroy military targets, but to undermine the morale of the enemy army and the will of their people to continue to resist. He explained that in Korea, F-86 aircraft were to be used to carry bombs or fuel tanks containing insects infected with infectious disease bacteria to carry out bacteriological warfare. These infectious diseases included bubonic plague, cholera, and typhus, which could be carried by various suitable insects. He went on to explain that bacteriological bombs had various different shells, some resembling 500-pound demolition bombs, and one resembling the external fuel tanks on F-86 aircraft. These bombs had internal compartments to hold insects. The head compartment contained a fuze separated from the remaining bacterial compartments, so that when the fuze exploded, the explosive force would not affect the bacterial compartments, allowing the bomb to open and release the insects. The fuze usually used was a proximity fuze that would detonate the bomb at a fixed height above the ground. But any kind of fuze could be fitted. He said that when we reported to our station in Korea, we would receive more information about bacteriological warfare. In closing, he again warned us to keep these intelligence strictly secret.

I arrived at the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group in Gimpo on April 1st. The 4th Group had three F-86 aircraft squadrons, the 334th, 335th, and 336th. I was assigned to the 336th Squadron. Around April 7th or 8th, Lieutenant Lidland, the group intelligence officer, gave a lesson in the briefing room on how the 4th Group would participate in bacteriological warfare. He first emphasized that the lesson he was about to give was top-secret, and that general ground crew and others not directly involved did not know about it, so we were not allowed to discuss it outside the briefing room. When he learned that we had attended a similar lesson at Nellis Air Force Base, he simply reiterated that the purpose of bacteriological warfare was to undermine morale and the people's will to support the war. He then said that as pilots of the 4th Group, we would also be ordered to carry out bacteriological warfare in the Chinese mainland north of the Yalu River as part of a plan to prevent the Chinese people from helping and supporting the North Korean people. He pointed out that in carrying out these missions in Northeast China, each aircraft would carry one bacteriological bomb and one ordinary fuel tank, so that the aircraft would have enough fuel to fly over the Yalu River. All the bacteria would be infectious disease bacteria such as bubonic plague, typhus, and cholera. He said that the details of each mission, bombing instructions, etc. would be explained at the briefing for each mission, but in any case, the bacteriological bombs would be loaded onto the designated aircraft by special ground personnel to prevent the leakage of any of this intelligence to the ground crew at the base.

After the lesson, we learned that not only were we to carry out bacteriological warfare missions, but we might also fly into the neutral territory of Northeast China, which naturally generated a sense of fear and disgust. Especially when we actually flew into Northeast China, we felt an extremely abhorrent towards carrying out bacteriological warfare missions. Most of the pilots thought that bacteriological warfare was despicable and hated being assigned to carry out such missions, because it would expose us to a greater risk of being captured in neutral territory.

    美国空军第四战斗截击机联队第四战斗截击机大队第三三六战斗截击机中队驾驶员中尉小约翰·格·爱立斯的供词
    我是小约翰·格·爱立斯美国空军中尉，军号AO—1862790，前住弗吉尼亚州里士满城斯徒阿特街二○二六号。
    一九五○年十一月参加空军以前，我在杜邦公司当工程师，参加空军后，我首先被派至得克萨斯州康纳利空军基地受驾驶员基本训练，然后再至亚利桑那州威廉姆斯空军基地受喷气式飞机进修训练，一九五一年十二月在那里毕业后，我被送至内华达州内利斯空军基地受F—80和F—86的战斗训练，时间是在一九五二年一月和二月间出国至朝鲜前。
    我自五月一日起至七月二十日击落被俘时，共执行了四次细菌战飞行任务，二次去中国，二次在北朝鲜，在所有这些任务中，昆虫是被带在外形与机外油箱相似的容器内。
    约在一九五二年五月一日，我参与大队的第五次任务时，我的小队驾驶员被通知在黎明前去报到接受一次清晨的简令，我们四人去作战科简令室报到，大队情报官利得兰尉官和气象官接见我们。利得兰尉官告诉我们说：我们的飞机将带一个油箱和一个油箱型的细菌弹，弹内带有受腺鼠疫感染的跳蚤。他告诉我们越过鸭绿江进入中国境内，把这些油箱（副油箱与油箱型细菌弹）一起投在安东与大东沟中间的一个地方。利得兰尉官告诉我们说：假若遇见米格飞机，即将油箱一起投下，加快速度，尽可能快的回来。
    我们回至中队住所，由小队长简要的谈了一下他的飞行路线，飞至镇南浦以西然后向北飞越过海面，以避免米格飞机通常飞行的区域，然后在“郎洞”（译音）半岛进入陆空。他告诉我们至新义州时向左转弯以东北向西南之方向越过安东和大东沟机场，然后飞回海面，循原路返回基地。我们在黎明前约二十分钟起飞，我们在海上向北飞至“郎洞”半岛时转向新义州。我们环绕新义州开始向左转弯俯冲，在飞过安东约三英里处我投下了油箱型细菌弹和副油箱，那时正是太阳上升后数分钟，当我飞出中国东北进入黄海时，我瞥见了鸭绿江口，我们飞越镇南浦即返回K—14基地。
    大约在一个星期以后，在五月八日左右，第三百三十六中队的六个驾驶员被排定于当日下午一时到作战科报到接受简令。当我们到达时，其他中队里的四个小队的人员已先到了。利得兰尉官下简令说：今天是搜索米格飞机的巡逻任务，第五十一战斗机大队的友机将于我们去后一小时进入北朝鲜，此外在同一地区没有其他友机。接着他说第三百三十六中队（我的中队）的飞机还要携带内装有受感染的昆虫的油箱型细菌弹，以执行一次细菌战任务。六架飞机中的四架要带一个油箱型细菌弹和一个副油箱，使其有足够的油量在清川江以北进行巡逻。其余二架飞机（包括我的）在每架飞机上要带二个油箱型细菌弹，在投下油箱后要沿清川江作一短促巡回，然后返回金浦。他命令四机小队和二机基队要把油箱型细菌弹和副油箱同时投在镇南浦正东北处。我们在镇南浦东北约五英里处投下了我们的油箱型细菌弹。到达清川江时我们向左转弯飞向江口后返回K—14基地。
    约在五月二十三日，我们小队被指定与其他中队的约六个小队在早晨去报到接受简令。在作战科简令室内利得兰尉官发布简令说：第四十九和第八战斗轰炸机大队的飞机将袭击平壤东北十英里处一铁路线，我们大队的任务是进行巡逻，保护战斗轰炸机免受米格飞机的攻击。利得兰尉官还说，我自己这个小队要在巡逻的同时，执行细菌战任务。他说，我们的飞机各带一个油箱型细菌弹和一个副油箱，二者都要在新安州和安州之中点投下。我们在十一小时零数分起飞，把油箱型细菌弹和副油箱同时投在新安州和安州之中点。接着我们向左转弯开始在清川江口和镇南浦间作巡逻，返回基地后即由小队长到作战科汇报。
    我在六月十日左右执行的最后一次细菌战任务，也是越过鸭绿江进入中国的，主要不同处是这次简令由联队长泰恩上校和利得兰尉官发布的。
    在把地区与高度指派给所有小队后，泰恩上校告诉所有的小队（我的小队除外）要保留副油箱，除非看到米格飞机。他结束了简令，我的小队长就走到简令室前面以听取利得兰尉官的指示，其余的人则回到自己中队去。约十分钟后，他回来说我们要携带一个副油箱和一个油箱型细菌弹，这些油箱要投在水丰发电厂以上鸭绿江以北的中国东北境内。飞向目标时第五十一联队的一些单位与米格飞机发生战斗。当我们飞临水丰发电厂时我们有两个小队与米格飞机稍稍接触了一下，没有结果。但我们未曾与米格飞机遭遇。我们在发电厂东端越过鸭绿江，降低高度和加快速度。虽然我们没有看见米格飞机，但米格飞机已在上空，故我和其他的僚机很少注意地形，而密切注视着上方与后方，以防可能的攻击，我们的恐惧由于知道已进入中国而增加了。当我们至中国东北之宽甸以南七或八英里处投下细菌弹和副油箱时，我们是朝西飞行的。接着，我们向左急转再度飞越鸭绿江，并在发电厂之南作一短促之巡逻，然后向回飞经过“郎洞”半岛以南，沿海岸飞返基地。
    这就是有关我个人参与细菌战的全部情况。在我执行第一次任务以前我曾得到关于在朝鲜驾驶F—86型飞机时所要预期到的事情的详细训示。一九五二年二月二十日左右，当我在美国内华达州内利斯空军基地时，地面学校指挥官麦克英特少校曾在地面学校的戏院里给我们上了一堂绝密课，只有F—86型飞机的驾驶员学员才准参加。麦克英特少校首先调强这堂课的绝密性质，并命令在离开课堂后，绝对不能谈论。他说：细菌战的目的并不是要直接毁坏军事目标，而是去破坏敌军的士气和他们人民继续抵抗的意志。他解释说：在朝鲜F—86型飞机要被用来携带内装受传染病菌感染的昆虫的炸弹或油箱，以进行细菌战。这些传染病中有腺鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒，可由各种适合的昆虫携带。他继续解释说：细菌弹有各种不同的弹壳，有些类似五百磅的爆破型炸弹，有一种像F—86型飞机上的外部油箱。这些炸弹内部都有隔室以容装昆虫。头部隔室内装有信管与其余细菌隔室隔开，故当信管爆炸时爆炸力不会影响细菌隔室，而使炸弹打开放出昆虫。通常所用的信管是定距信管在离地面一固定高度将炸弹炸开。但任何一种信管都能装入。他说：当我们到朝鲜的驻地报到时，还要获得更多有关细菌战的情况。结束时，他再次警告我们要严格地对这些情报保守秘密。
    四月一日我到金浦第四战斗截击机大队去服役。第四大队下设第三百三十四、第三百三十五和第三百三十六，三个F—86型飞机中队。我被指派至第三百三十六中队。约在四月七日或八日，大队情报官利得兰尉官在简令室讲了一堂有关第四大队如何参加细菌战的课，他首先强调他就要谈的课是属绝密的，一般地勤人员和其他与此无直接关系的人都不知道，故我们不得在简令室之外谈论。当他知道我们曾在内利斯基地上过一堂类似的课程后，他就简单重述一遍：细菌战的目的，是破坏士气和人民支持战争的意志。接着他说作为第四大队的驾驶员，我们也要被命令在鸭绿江以北中国本土进行细菌战，以作为阻止中国人民帮助和支持北朝鲜人民的计划的一部分。他指出，在中国东北执行这些任务，各机要携带一枚细菌弹和一个普通油箱，这样飞机就有足够的油量飞越鸭绿江。所有细菌都将是如腺鼠疫、斑疹伤寒和霍乱等传染病菌。他说，每次任务的详情、投弹指示等将要在每次任务传达简令时说明，但在任何情况下，细菌弹都是由特别地勤人员装上指定的飞机，以防止泄漏任何这些情报给基地的地勤人员。
    下课后由于我们了解到不仅要执行细菌战任务，而且还有可能飞到中国东北的中立领土去，因而自然地产生了一种又恐惧又厌恶的情绪。尤其在我们真正飞入中国东北时，我们对执行细菌战任务更感到异常的嫌恶。绝大部分驾驶员都认为细菌战是卑鄙的，并痛恨被指派执行这种任务，因为这会使我们冒着在中立领土被俘的更大危险。
