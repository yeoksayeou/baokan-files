    Neglecting Plumbing and Heating Installation Projects Will Delay Construction and Cause Waste
    Sun Yusheng of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau writes: Based on my practical experience over the past two years, late arrival of boilers often affects the on-schedule completion of basic construction projects. For example, in 1952, on the 101 construction site belonging to the First Engineering Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, the boilers were supplied too late by the client, and installation did not begin until the end of November. As a result, due to the cold weather, a large number of pipes and radiators from other locations were cracked by freezing. At that time, in order to safely deliver water, wood and charcoal were used around the pipes and radiators for heating and frost prevention, thus consuming more than 300,000 jin of wood and dozens of train cars of charcoal.
    Currently, some basic construction units, both clients and contractors, do not pay enough attention to the timely supply of boilers. According to statistics from the nine key construction sites under the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, more than half of the boilers and plumbing and heating equipment have not been settled, or will not be delivered to the site until after October, which seriously affects the early completion of the project. For example, the 105 construction site requires a total of 23 large and small boilers, but only 16 were available in October; the boiler room water pumps require a total of 23 units, but only 14 are available; the rest will not be delivered until November. The boiler project at the 308 construction site is still being changed. The original plan was to use one high-pressure boiler, but the client proposed to change it to three low-pressure boilers, but the design has not been finalized, and the boilers are also not settled. The 316 construction site requires a total of three large boilers, and two are still missing. The 111 construction site has no clues about the required boilers. The civil engineering construction of these construction sites could have been completed in October, but most of the boilers will not arrive at the site until November, and some are even not settled, which seriously affects the smooth progress of plumbing and heating installation projects, and will cause unnecessary losses to the country.
    In order to avoid the delay of construction periods due to the late arrival of plumbing and heating equipment and materials, basic construction units must conscientiously grasp the procurement and installation of plumbing and heating equipment and boilers to ensure the completion of the state's basic construction plan for this year on schedule or ahead of schedule.

### 不重视水暖安装工程  就会拖延工期造成浪费

    不重视水暖安装工程就会拖延工期造成浪费
    沈阳市人民政府建筑工程局孙雨生来信：根据我两年来实际工作中的经验，锅炉到得太晚，往往会影响基本建设工程的按期完工。如一九五二年沈阳市建筑工程局第一工程公司所属一○一工地，因甲方锅炉供应太迟，在十一月末才开始安装。结果因天气太冷，外地沟管子及暖气片被冻裂的数量很大。当时为了安全送水，就在管子及暖气片的周围用木材和木炭烤火防寒，因此消耗了木材三十多万斤，木炭数十车皮。
    目前，还有某些基本建设单位的甲乙双方，对及时供应锅炉的问题不加重视。根据目前沈阳市建筑工程局所属九个重点工地统计，就有半数以上的锅炉及水暖器材还没有着落，或者要在十月以后才能运入现场，这就严重影响了工程的及早竣工。如一○五工地共需大小锅炉二十三台，十月份仅有十六台；锅炉房水泵共需二十三台，仅有十四台；其余的要在十一月份才能运到。三○八工地锅炉工程仍在变更，原计划采用高压锅炉一台，甲方又提出改为低压锅炉三台，但尚未正式设计，锅炉亦无着落。三一六工地共需大锅炉三台，现在还缺两台。一一一工地所需锅炉至今尚无头绪。这些工地的土木建筑工程本来在十月份都可以全部竣工，但锅炉也大多在十一月份才能运达工地，有的甚至还无着落，这就严重地影响了水暖安装工程的顺利进行，以致将要给国家造成不应有的损失。
    为了避免基本建设工程因水暖安装设备材料到货较迟而拖延工期的情况，基本建设单位必须认真抓紧水暖器材及锅炉的采购和安装工作，以保证按期或提前完成国家今年的基本建设计划。
