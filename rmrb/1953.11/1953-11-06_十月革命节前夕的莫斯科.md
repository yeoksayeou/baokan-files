Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th: The festive atmosphere has made Moscow even more solemn and beautiful. The working people of Moscow are welcoming the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with a sense of happiness as communist society draws nearer.

	Red Square, the heart of the capital, is undergoing its final festive decorations. Opposite the Kremlin, in the center of the tall building of the State Department Store, the Soviet national emblem and huge portraits of Lenin and Stalin are hung, flanked by the national emblems of the sixteen republics and the gold-lettered slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the festival. Colorful electric lights are installed on the buildings around Red Square, and red flags are flying. Like every year, the Central Telegraph Office on Gorky Street is particularly dazzling. Twenty-five thousand brilliant electric lights illuminate a huge slogan made up of two-meter-high letters: "Fulfill the Decisions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." Throughout Gorky Street, decorations dedicated to this great theme can be seen everywhere. Many colorful numbers and vivid pictures illustrate the glorious labor victories the Soviet people have achieved in implementing the call of the Party and the government.

	On the eve of the festival, Moscow's workers fulfilled their festive competition pledges. Many enterprises and workers have completed their production tasks for the year. Before the festival, they had already begun producing products for 1954. Construction workers have completed residential buildings in various districts, allowing thousands of families to move into new homes before the festival. The light industry and daily necessities industries produced extra products beyond their plans for the festival. The light industry and daily necessities industries in the Kirov district produced more than 600,000 meters of wool fabrics, more than 200,000 pairs of various styles of shoes, and countless other daily necessities beyond the plan.

	On the eve of the festival, the people of Moscow are filled with festive joy. Thousands of artists and installers are working on the main streets. Festive programs are being rehearsed in the theaters. At the entrances of post and telecommunications offices, people are sending telegrams to relatives and friends in distant places to congratulate them on the festival. On the eve of the festival, many new shops have opened in Moscow. The festive goods displayed in the stores are much richer than in previous years.

    十月革命节前夕的莫斯科
    【新华社莫斯科五日电】节日来临前的气象使莫斯科更加庄严美丽。莫斯科的劳动人民带着共产主义社会日益临近的幸福感觉迎接十月社会主义革命三十六周年。
    首都的中心——红场正在进行最后的节日装饰。克里姆林宫对面，在国家百货商店的高大建筑中央，悬挂着苏联的国徽和列宁斯大林的巨幅画像，两旁是十六个加盟共和国的国徽和苏共中央节日号召的金字标语。红场四周的各个楼厦上，都安上了五彩的电炬，飘扬着红旗。像每年的节日一样，高尔基大街上的中央电报局的盛装特别夺目。这里安设了二万五千盏灿烂的电灯，照耀着一幅巨大的由二公尺高的字母组成的标语“完成苏共中央九月全会的决定”。整个高尔基大街上，到处都可以看见献给这个伟大主题的装饰。许多彩色的数字和鲜明的图画，说明苏联人民执行党和政府的号召，已获得了辉煌的劳动胜利。
    在节日前夕，莫斯科劳动者完成了自己的节日竞赛诺言。许多企业和工人都完成了今年的生产任务。在节日到来前，他们已开始出产一九五四年的产品。建筑工人已完成了各区的住宅建筑，使数千家庭在节日前迁入新居。各轻工业和日用品工业为节日生产了计划以外的产品。基洛夫区各轻工业和日用品工业，超计划生产了六十多万公尺毛织品，二十多万双各种式样的鞋和其他无数的日用品。
    在节日前夕，莫斯科人民充满了节日的欢欣。数以千计的艺术工作者和安装工人，在各主要街道上进行工作。各剧院内正在排演节日的剧目。在各邮电局门前，人们正在给远地的亲友拍发祝贺节日的电报。在节日前，莫斯科又有许多新的商店开幕了。各个商店里陈列的节日货品，比往年丰盛得多。人们从商店里买到精美低廉的节日礼品。
