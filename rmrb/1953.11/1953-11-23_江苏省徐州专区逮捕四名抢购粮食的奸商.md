    Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Prefecture arrested four profiteers who hoarded grain
    In order to protect the interests of the people and stabilize market order, the People's Governments of Pi County and Xinyi County in Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, recently arrested four large-scale speculative private merchants who used illegal means to hoard grain, disrupt the state's grain purchase plan, and disturb the market.
    Xuzhou Prefecture is the main soybean producing area in Jiangsu Province, with soybean production accounting for more than 50% of the province's total output. Local state-owned grain departments and cooperatives began purchasing soybeans as soon as they were on the market, and the purchase price was also reasonably increased compared to last year. However, due to speculative merchants such as Wang Yunong, Ma Yanqing, Chen Sheng, and Huang Rong rushing from Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places to hoard soybeans by illegal means and disrupt the market, the state's soybean purchase plan and the edible oil supply in some areas of Jiangsu Province were affected.
    The illegal activities of these speculative private merchants in hoarding soybeans were extremely egregious. They used methods such as buying off and colluding with local speculators and peddlers to rush to purchase soybeans everywhere. Wang Yunong, a major profiteer from Wuxi, arranged more than a dozen "agency stores" in the market towns of Pi County and Xinyi County and bought off more than twenty small donkey peddlers, hoarding more than 300,000 catties of soybeans and miscellaneous grains (including more than 200,000 catties of soybeans). The profiteer Chen Sheng colluded with speculative private merchants and hoarded 60,000 catties of soybeans at a price of 150 to 200 yuan per catty higher than the state's soybean purchase price. In rural areas with inconvenient transportation, they slashed prices for purchases, causing great losses to farmers. When these speculative private merchants were hoarding and defrauding soybeans in the countryside, they also slandered the People's Government, damaged the relationship between farmers and cooperatives, and created market chaos. After the government strengthened market management, Wang Yunong also summoned the small donkey peddler bosses, treated them to wine and food, and secretly discussed ways to confront the government. Afterwards, the donkey peddlers continued to carry out illegal activities in remote rural market towns.
    In order to protect the interests of the people, stabilize the market, and crack down on speculators, the People's Governments of Pi County and Xinyi County recently submitted a request to the Xuzhou District Commissioner's Office for approval to arrest the four profiteers Wang Yunong, Ma Yanqing, Chen Sheng, and Huang Rong, and are now handling the matter in accordance with the law.

    江苏省徐州专区逮捕四名抢购粮食的奸商
    江苏省徐州专区邳县和新沂县人民政府，为了保障人民利益，稳定市场秩序，最近逮捕了四名用非法手段抢购粮食，破坏国家购粮计划，扰乱市场的大投机私商。
    徐州专区是江苏省黄豆主要产区，黄豆产量占全省总产量的百分之五十以上。当地国营粮食部门和合作社在黄豆刚刚上市，即挂牌收购。收购价格也比去年合理地加以提高。但是由于王雨农、马彦清、陈生、黄荣等投机商人从无锡、苏州等地赶来用非法手段抢购黄豆，扰乱市场，结果国家收购黄豆的计划和江苏省部分地区的食油供应受到了影响。
    这些投机私商抢购黄豆的违法活动，情节极为恶劣。他们用收买和勾结当地投机商人和小贩等办法，四出抢购黄豆。无锡的大奸商王雨农在邳县、新沂等县的集镇上安排了十多家“代理店”，收买了二十多个小驴贩子，先后抢购黄豆和杂粮三十多万斤（其中黄豆有二十多万斤）。奸商陈生勾结投机私商，以比国家收购黄豆牌价每斤高一百五十元到二百元的价格，一次就抢购了六万斤黄豆。在交通不便的农村，他们就杀价收购，使农民吃亏很大。这些投机私商在农村中抢购和骗购黄豆时，还诽谤人民政府，破坏农民和合作社之间的关系，制造了市场的混乱。在政府加强了市场管理以后，王雨农还将小驴贩头子等召集起来，请他们喝酒吃饭，秘密商量和政府对抗的办法。事后驴贩子便继续在偏僻农村集镇进行非法活动。
    邳县和新沂县人民政府为了保障人民的利益，稳定市场，打击投机分子，日前已呈请徐州区专员公署批准，将奸商王雨农、马彦清、陈生、黄荣等四人逮捕，现正依法处理中。
