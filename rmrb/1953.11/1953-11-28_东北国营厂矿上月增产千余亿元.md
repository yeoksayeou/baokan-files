    Northeast State-Owned Factories and Mines Increase Production by Over 100 Billion Yuan Last Month
    [Report from this newspaper] In October, state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region overfulfilled the state plan, increasing the total value of production by over 100 billion yuan. The total value of production of state-owned industries in the region from January to October has exceeded the total output value of the entire year of last year by 4%. October was the best month for completing the plan this year. Enterprises under the five central industrial ministries in the Northeast completed 108.4% of their plan, an increase of 6.5% compared to September. Among the 56 major products of state-owned industries, 44 completed their production plan. Synthetic ammonia, soda ash, milling machines, and other products that did not complete their plans in September all overfulfilled their plans in October. Important products such as steel ingots, steel, raw coal, and generators all increased significantly compared to September. By the end of October, kerosene had already overfulfilled the annual plan, and gasoline was also close to completing the annual plan. In addition, the quality of products such as pig iron, steel ingots, electrolytic lead, electrolytic zinc, and cotton cloth also improved compared to September.
    In October, all units continued to implement the policy of closely combining competition with strengthened management, thus achieving greater achievements than in September. For example, the Xi'an Mining Bureau established a district responsibility system and a key equipment contracting mechanism, basically eliminating the phenomenon of unclear responsibilities, and no major accidents occurred, enabling all indicators in October to exceed the plan. The Third Machine Tool Factory, in response to problems such as insufficiently advanced work plans and a large number of products in progress, promoted day and night shift work plans in October, established a "workplace service system," grasped the flow of products in progress, and combined the promotion of advanced experience to solve key equipment problems, increasing the production balance rate by 12% compared to September, shortening the production cycle, overproducing 25 lathes, reducing costs by 8.7%, and overfulfilling the production increase and economy plan by 110%. In the competition, many units adopted the method of promoting advanced experience to solve weak links or key problems and improve production. Non-ferrous metal mines began to pay attention to promoting advanced experience in improving efficiency and actual recovery rate, increasing production efficiency by 2% to 5% and the actual recovery rate by 2% to 4%. The power industry department promoted the experience of burning low-quality coal, with the proportion of burning low-quality coal reaching 76.1%, saving 70,000 tons of good coal.
    However, in the production increase and economy competition, some factories and mines adopted rush tactics, disrupting the production order, so that production efficiency was not given due play, affecting the progress of production. For example, the production plan indicators of some mines in the coal mine and non-ferrous metal systems were completed well in October, but the mining progress could not keep up with the needs, especially the main roadway excavation was still behind. Yangjia Zhangzi and other mines under the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Administration adopted the method of weakening excavation forces to strengthen mining forces in order to complete mining tasks, thus disrupting the work plan and causing production difficulties. The Northeast Second Cement Plant has failed to complete its production plan for two months due to frequent equipment accidents. At present, the relevant party and administrative leading organs at all levels are taking effective measures to correct these abnormal phenomena.

### 东北国营厂矿上月增产千余亿元

    东北国营厂矿上月增产千余亿元
    【本报讯】十月份东北区国营厂矿超额完成了国家计划，增产总值一千余亿元。全区国营工业一至十月份的生产总值，已超过去年全年总产值的百分之四。十月份为今年以来完成计划最好的一个月。中央五个工业部在东北的企业，完成计划百分之一百零八点四，比九月份增加了百分之六点五。国营工业五十六种主要产品有四十四种完成了产量计划。九月份没有完成计划的合成氨、纯碱、铣床等，十月份均超额完成了计划。钢锭、钢材、原煤、发电机等重要产品，均较九月份增加很多。到十月底止煤油已超额完成了全年计划，汽油也接近完成全年计划。此外，生铁、钢锭、电铅、电锌、棉布等产品的质量也较九月份有了提高。
    十月份，各单位继续贯彻竞赛与加强管理紧密结合的方针，因而获得比九月份更大的成就。例如：西安矿务局建立了分区专责制及重要设备包机制，基本上消灭了责任不清的现象，未发生一次重大事故，使十月份各项指标超过计划。第三机床厂针对作业计划不够先进、在制品多等的问题，在十月份推广了昼夜班作业计划，建立了“工作地服务制度”，掌握了在制品的流动，结合推广先进经验，解决了设备上的关键问题，使生产均衡率比九月份提高百分之十二，生产周转期缩短，超额生产车床二十五台，降低成本百分之八点七，超额完成了增产节约计划百分之一百一十。竞赛中，好多单位都采取推广先进经验的办法，解决了薄弱环节或关键问题，提高了生产。有色金属矿山开始注意推广提高效率和实收率的先进经验，生产效率提高了百分之二至百分之五，实收率提高百分之二至百分之四。电业部门推广烧劣煤的经验，烧劣煤比重达到百分之七十六点一，节约好煤七万吨。
    但是在增产节约竞赛中，部分厂矿采取突击的办法，打乱了生产秩序，以致生产效率未得到应有的发挥，影响了生产的进行。例如煤矿和有色金属系统的某些矿山，十月份的生产计划指标完成较好，但采掘进度赶不上需要，特别是主要巷道掘进仍然落后。有色金属工业管理局的杨家杖子等矿山采取削弱掘进力量以加强采矿力量的办法来完成采矿任务，因而打乱了作业计划，造成了生产上的困难。东北第二水泥厂由于设备事故多，已两个月未完成产量计划。目前有关各级党、行政的领导机关正采取有效措施，纠正这些不正常的现象。
