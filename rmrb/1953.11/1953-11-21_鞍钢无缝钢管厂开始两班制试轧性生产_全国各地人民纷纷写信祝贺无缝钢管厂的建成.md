Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant has begun to enter an orderly two-shift trial production schedule. On the morning of the 16th, the second shift of production personnel, who had been trained during the one-shift production process, officially took up their positions. The original first shift personnel are now working the night shift. Both shifts of production personnel conscientiously and skillfully implement operating procedures and shift handover, technical safety, and equipment maintenance systems. Therefore, both output and quality have exceeded the prescribed targets.

The two-shift production at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant is based on one-shift production. During the one-shift production process, the workers, with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, gradually became familiar with the complex mechanical equipment and improved their operating skills. In the past half-month, the plant has not only had any personal accidents or major equipment accidents, but production has been steadily increasing. By the day before the start of two-shift production, the actual hourly output averaged 29 percent higher than on the 11th, and 70 percent higher than the average for the first three days of one-shift production. Soviet experts believe that such achievements in such a technically complex factory in such a short period of time are considered very good even in the Soviet Union.

In order to start full production as soon as possible, all the workers in the plant have been working even harder in the past few days to prepare for three-shift production. The production management department is drafting various measures and actively preparing the raw materials and tools needed for future mass production. The actual operators have all submitted guarantees to the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Seamless Steel Tube Plant to learn practical operating skills, pay attention to safe operation, and strengthen equipment maintenance and repair. The personnel who will be responsible for the third shift of production are also going to the site every day to learn the practical operating skills of the first two shifts of production personnel.

According to Xinhua News Agency: People from all over the country have written letters to the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant, congratulating the birth of the first batch of seamless steel tubes in New China. The letter writers include commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding the national defense line of the motherland, students in the capital and workers in Shijingshan, Shenyang and other places, working cadres in rural areas of Northeast China, and staff members of institutions in the Northwest frontier. In their letters, they unanimously congratulated this great victory in the socialist industrialization process of the motherland, believing that the completion of the seamless steel tube plant would strongly support the economic construction of the motherland, thus giving them great encouragement. The letter from all the commanders and fighters of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers said: The birth of seamless steel tubes has further encouraged our enthusiasm and confidence in defending the motherland, and we must be a hundred times more vigilant against the conspiracies of American imperialism. Liu Guangjin, a model worker in Beijing and deputy director of the boiler field operation at the Shijingshan Power Plant, said in his letter: With new seamless steel tubes, we have more guarantees for safe production. As the saying goes, burning a boiler is burning tubes. Seamless steel tubes are like human blood vessels for a boiler. In the past, because the tubes were too old, the boiler often had problems. Now that we have our own seamless steel tubes, it's really gratifying.

In order to thank the people of the whole country for their warm concern, all the workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant wrote a letter of thanks to the people of the whole country on November 10. In their letter, they guaranteed that they would continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve their technical level, and become familiar with operations, so as to produce a large number of high-quality seamless steel tubes more quickly to meet the needs of the motherland's economic construction.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂开始两班制试轧性生产
    全国各地人民纷纷写信祝贺无缝钢管厂的建成
    【新华社鞍山二十日电】鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂已开始有秩序地进入每天两班制的试轧性生产。十六日清晨，在一班制生产过程中培养出来的第二班生产人员正式走上了操作岗位。原来的第一班人员现在担任了夜班生产。两班生产人员都认真而熟练地执行操作规程和交接班、技术安全、设备维护等制度，因此，产量和质量都超过了规定指标。
    无缝钢管厂两班制生产是在一班制生产基础上进行的。在一班制生产过程中，职工们在苏联专家的具体帮助下，逐渐熟悉了复杂的机械设备，提高了操作的技术水平。半个月来，全厂不但没有发生过任何人身事故和重大的设备事故，而且生产一直在稳步上升。到开始两班制生产的前一天，每小时实际产量平均比十一日提高了百分之二十九，比一班制生产的最初三天平均提高了百分之七十。苏联专家认为，在像这样技术复杂的工厂里，短期内就得到这样成绩，在苏联也算是很好的。
    全厂职工为了早日全面开工生产，这几天来，三班制生产的准备工作更加紧张了。生产管理部门正在拟订各种措施，并积极准备将来大量生产时需用的原料和工具。实际操作人员都纷纷向中共无缝钢管厂总支委员会提出学好实际操作技术、注意安全操作、加强设备维护检修等项保证。即将担负第三班生产的人员，每天也都到现场学习前两班生产人员的实际操作技术。
    据新华社讯：全国人民纷纷写信给鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂职工，祝贺新中国第一批无缝钢管的诞生。写信的人有远在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员和守卫在祖国国防线上的人民解放军战士，有首都的学生和石景山、沈阳等地的工人，有东北农村的工作干部和西北边疆的机关工作人员。他们在信中一致祝贺祖国社会主义工业化进程中的这一个伟大胜利，认为无缝钢管厂的建成将有力地支援祖国的经济建设，因而给他们以巨大的鼓舞。中国人民志愿军某部二连全体指挥员战斗员的信里说：无缝钢管的诞生更加鼓舞了我们保卫祖国的热情和信心，我们要百倍地警惕美帝国主义的阴谋活动。北京市劳动模范、石景山发电厂锅炉场运行副主任刘光金信中说：有了新的无缝钢管，我们安全生产就更有保障，俗语说烧锅炉就是烧管子，无缝钢管对于锅炉来说就好像人的血管一样，过去因为管子太旧，锅炉常出毛病，现在咱们有了自己的无缝钢管，可真叫人高兴。
    为了答谢全国人民的热情关怀，无缝钢管厂全体职工在十一月十日给全国人民写了一封致谢信。他们在信中保证今后继续努力学习苏联先进经验，提高技术水平，熟悉操作，以便更快地生产出大批优等质量的无缝钢管，供应祖国经济建设的需要。
