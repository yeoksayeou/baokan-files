Great Progress in National Forest Survey Work

In the past two years, national forest survey work has made great progress. In order to restore and expand forest resources, scientifically manage them, cultivate and plant trees on a large scale, and reasonably harvest timber to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives, various regions have been transferring cadres and allocating resources to carry out forest survey work since 1949. In 1950, the Northeast region formed a survey team of approximately 300 people to survey forest farms. Due to the needs of the work, it has developed into a forest and field survey team of more than 2,000 people by last year. During the same period, the Inner Mongolia region has developed from a professional group of 11 people into a survey team of hundreds of people. So far, in addition to the three forest survey brigades and one aerial survey team directly under the Central Ministry of Forestry, there are also 34 professional survey teams in various regions. Thanks to the hard work and continuous efforts of the forest survey staff, in 1951 and 1952, surveys of the main forest areas of Changbai Mountain were conducted for management purposes. In 1951, surveys were also conducted on the coastal defense forests in southern Northeast and the main belt of protective forests in western Northeast, which are of great significance for improving the economic lives of the people in Northeast China. Last year, a comprehensive field survey was conducted on the northern slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In addition, windbreak and sand-fixing forests in western Hebei, northern Shaanxi, and eastern Henan were also surveyed. Currently, two more brigades are conducting management surveys on the southern slope of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, preparing conditions for the further development of the Tangwang River and other forest areas in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. One brigade is conducting surveys in the Bailongjiang Gongba River area in the Northwest. It is expected that by the end of this year, a total of more than 10 million hectares of forest surveys and more than 8 million hectares of afforestation surveys will be completed. The surveyed forest areas have initially clarified the forest area and timber reserves. This is of great help to the rational logging of timber and the restoration and expansion of forests in the future. In terms of aerial surveys, a group of aerial survey cadres were gathered in early autumn to conduct aerial test work in the Dahailin area of Songjiang, creating experience for the heavy aerial surveys in the future. In order to observe remote forest areas and provide a basis for ground surveys and the development of forest land, in early September, survey and photography cadres were transferred and organized an aerial survey team in cooperation with relevant personnel from various regions to conduct aerial surveys of the vast forest areas in the Southwest and Northwest.

Next year, it is planned to conduct forest management surveys on the southern slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and to use the full strength of the aerial survey team to survey the forest area on the northern slope of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and to survey the scattered forest areas in Southwest, Northwest, Central South, and East China. In the future, in order to closely coordinate forestry logging, afforestation and cultivation, as well as agricultural and pastoral, water conservancy and other work, it is planned to change the past general survey to a focus survey.

In terms of survey methods, the old geodetic survey method was used in the initial stage. This not only required a large amount of funding, but also progressed slowly and lacked accuracy. In 1951, Soviet experts introduced a complete set of new survey methods: in terms of forest surveys, there are forest management survey methods and equidistant parallel line survey methods; in terms of afforestation land surveys, there are comprehensive survey methods. These methods have revolutionized forest survey work, saving money and improving work efficiency. It would take 20 years to survey all the forests in the Northeast using the old method, but now it only takes five years. The survey area per person per day in the South China survey team has increased from 120 mu to 700 mu, and 80% of the funds can be saved per unit area. In the process of investigation, the staff gradually mastered advanced technology and made new creations, which improved work efficiency by 20% to 115%; at the same time, labor organization and work methods were improved. In the protective forest survey, the creation of zoning, segmentation, and simultaneous advancement and other survey methods also increased work efficiency by 80%. (Xia Yuming) (Attached picture)

    全国森林调查工作有很大进展
    全国森林调查工作在最近两年中有很大进展。为了恢复和扩大森林资源、科学地进行经营管理、大量育林、造林和合理采伐木材，以适应国家建设和人民生活的需要，各地在一九四九年便抽调干部配备力量，进行森林调查工作。东北地区一九五○年曾组成约三百人的调查队，勘查林场，由于工作的需要，到去年已发展成拥有二千多人的林野调查队。同一时期，内蒙古地区已由十一人组成的专业小组发展成数百人的调查队伍。到目前为止，除已编成直属中央林业部的三个森林调查大队和一个航空测量队外，各地还有三十四个专业调查队。由于森林调查工作人员的刻苦耐劳、不断努力，在一九五一和一九五二年中，已对长白山的主要林区作了经营管理的调查；一九五一年还调查了对改善东北人民经济生活有很大意义的东北南部海防林和西部防护林基干带；去年又在大兴安岭北坡进行全面的踏查了解；此外，还勘查了冀西、陕北和豫东的防风砂林。现在还有两个大队在小兴安岭南坡进行经营管理的调查，给进一步开发小兴安岭汤旺河等林区准备条件；一个大队在西北白龙江贡坝河地区进行勘测。预计到今年年底，共可完成森林调查一千多万公顷、宜林地调查八百多万公顷。经过调查的林区，都初步弄清了森林面积和木材积蓄量。这样，对今后木材的合理采伐、森林的恢复和扩大等，都有很大帮助。在航空调查方面，秋初曾集中了一批航空测量干部，在松江大海林地区进行航测试点工作，为今后繁重的空中调查创造了经验。为了观查边远林区，替地面调查和林地的开发提供依据，九月初又抽调调查、摄影干部，配合各地有关人员，组织了空视调查队，开始对西南、西北的广大林区进行空中视查。
    明年，准备在大兴安岭南坡进行森林经营管理的调查，并以航空测量队全部力量，调查大、小兴安岭北坡林区情况，勘查西南、西北、中南、华东等地的零散林区。今后为了紧密地配合森工采伐、造林育林及农牧、水利等工作，拟改变过去的普遍调查为重点调查。
    在调查方法上，初期曾采用旧的大地测量法，这不但需要大量经费，而且进度迟缓，精确程度也差。一九五一年，苏联专家介绍了一整套新的调查方法：在森林调查方面有森林经营管理调查法、等距平行线调查法，在宜林地调查方面有综合调查法。这些方法使森林调查工作得到革新，既节省经费，又提高了工作效率。东北全部森林用旧法需二十年才能调查完，现在只需五年。华南调查队每人每天的调查面积由一百二十亩提高到七百亩，在单位面积上还可以节省百分之八十的经费。在调查过程中，工作人员逐渐地掌握了先进技术，并有了新的创造，使工作效率提高了百分之二十到一百一十五；同时并改善了劳动组织和工作方法。在防护林调查中，创造分区分段、齐头并进等调查法，也提高工作效率百分之八十。　（夏玉明）（附图片）
