    Trade Unions in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Exchanging Work Experience of Trade Union Groups
    The Dalian-Lüda Trade Union Federation convened a meeting of heads of trade union groups from all factories in the city on October 17 to exchange experiences in increasing production and practicing economy. At the meeting, four groups with different characteristics introduced their typical experiences. Xie Zai'gao's group from Dalian Crane Factory introduced how they carefully examined and delved into key issues during the discussion of plans, and how they solved many key quality problems that had never been solved in the past by visiting the previous work process and holding waste product exhibitions. Liu Qinghe's group from Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant introduced the experience of mobilizing veteran technical workers to discuss plans and combining the formulation of increase production and practice economy plans with the compilation of operation plans. The riveting fourth group of Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company introduced their experience in strengthening inspection work and implementing operation plans. Shu Guangzhu's group from Dalian Textile Factory introduced the experience of calculating pre-accounts and post-accounts, conducting technical calibration, clarifying key points, and promoting advanced experiences. After the meeting, the heads of the trade union groups generally reflected: "The meeting was held at the right time, and we have methods to use when we return."
    Training Trade Union Group Leaders
    In order to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the trade union of the state-owned Qingdao Fifth Cotton Textile Factory used four days of spare time in mid-October, a total of six hours, to train group leaders in an experience exchange format. During the experience exchange, the experience of how the Jia class warp winding group of the preparation workshop comprehensively completed the plans for the second and third quarters, and how the second group of the B class of the spinning workshop improved the skills of new workers and comprehensively completed the plans were emphasized. The group leaders gained confidence in their work after listening to these experiences. According to preliminary statistics, before training the group leaders, only 30 groups in the factory comprehensively completed their group plans, but now the number has increased to 50 groups.

    Organizing Competition Lectures
    In order to overcome the formalism tendency of some factories and mines in formulating increase production and practice economy plans, and to implement the policy of combining increase production and practice economy with improving management level, the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions organized a lecture on how offices and groups can mobilize the masses to formulate increase production and practice economy plans and carry out competitions on October 17. Representatives from the Technical Inspection Section of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and Zhao Daqing Group of the Metalworking Workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory were the main speakers. They introduced the experience of the section and group in formulating increase production and practice economy plans and carrying out competitions. More than 400 trade union cadres and engineering and technical personnel from various factories and mines in Taiyuan City attended the lecture. After the meeting, representatives from various factories and mines expressed that they would learn from these experiences and inspect and revise the plans to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    Visiting Advanced Experience Performances
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction tasks on schedule and ahead of schedule, and to solve the current problems of insufficient plasterers and low construction efficiency in many construction sites, the Shenyang City Construction Trade Union organized 151 veteran technical workers, group leaders, some administrative cadres and trade union cadres from nine units to visit the 105 construction site and the 205 construction site, and watched the actual performances of advanced operation methods by Li Shenghua's group and Jia Yuanlin's group, etc. At the same time, they also organized a visit to the advanced experience photo exhibition, and Li Shenghua, a model worker of the city, introduced the operation methods of various advanced tools and the allocation of labor organization.
    The visitors all felt that using new tools and implementing large-scale assembly line operations were good ways to improve plastering efficiency. Especially after seeing that 30 apprentices could complete the plastering task of a large building by using new tools, they all unanimously reflected: "It's really amazing!" The veteran technicians all expressed that they would further promote the advanced experience of plastering after returning. Some people asked for the drawings of advanced tools immediately after the visit, and some immediately borrowed tool models to prepare for making them. Some people learned to operate on the spot. After the visit, a forum was also organized, and the visitors further put forward improvement opinions on labor organization, advanced tools, etc.
    "Lightning Express"
    The metalworking workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory has recently improved the blackboard newspaper and adopted "Lightning Express" to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees. There are two kinds of charts on the "Lightning Express", one is to show the daily production progress, and the other is to announce the product quality and defective products, both of which are filled in every day. The outstanding achievements of the workers that day are also written out and praised in a timely manner. Since its establishment, the "Lightning Express" has promoted the production of the workshop. For example, Duan Zhengyuan, a worker of the Yuan class, shortened the time for making square wheels for drilling rigs from four hours to two and a half hours. The workshop recorder immediately wrote this achievement on the express report and praised it. Everyone saw it during the lunch break. Duan Zhengyuan's confidence in improving work efficiency was even higher. The next day, when he was working (sleeves), he learned the assembly line operation method, and the efficiency increased by 30%. This achievement was reported on the same day. Many new records created by other workers have also been reported. Now the workers have to go to see the express report after work. They also composed a clapper rhyme saying: "Lightning report, lightning report, you can know what happened on the same day, the content is fresh and concise, strive to report your name every day." (Liu Peichen, Yang Zuoliang)
    Mobilizing Family Members to Participate in Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition
    In order to mobilize the family members of employees to actively participate in the increase production and practice economy competition and further promote the experience of Gao Fengqin's group, a national model family member, the Women's Department of the Shenyang City Federation of Trade Unions held a representative meeting of family members of employees in Shenyang City in early October. There were more than 400 people attending the meeting, including representatives of family committees of various factories, cadres above the group leader level, and activists.
    At the meeting, representatives from the family committees of the 53rd Factory and the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory respectively introduced their experience in closely combining production, organically and closely contacting relevant units, and carrying out family work.
    Formulating Labor-Capital Production Contract
    After the start of the increase production and practice economy campaign, Beijing Private Chuxiang Paper Mill, through labor-capital consultation meetings, publicly contracted sales orders. After discussion and research by the trade union group, based on the sales order contract and self-sales plan, the labor-capital production contract was drafted and formulated, and the production plan before the contract was signed was revised. The signing of the production contract greatly improved the enthusiasm of the capitalist for management. The deputy manager of the capitalist not only purchased materials and promoted goods everywhere, but also took the initiative to contact the state-owned trust company to acquire raw materials. When solving the acquisition of 200,000 catties of raw materials in Linfen, Shanxi, the capitalist took the initiative to hold a business meeting and invited the trade union to participate and provide opinions. (Yu Hong, Shan Lei)
    Affectionate Visit
    From January to September this year, the state-owned Shanghai First Cotton Textile Factory failed to meet the planned target for attendance rate. According to statistics, the total number of workers' work stoppages in the factory has caused the state to lose nearly 90,000 workdays (excluding long-term sick leave and maternity leave). In October, trade union cadres and all party and League members in the factory visited workers' homes in an organized manner during the National Day holiday. They visited a total of 800 workers. It is understood that in the past, many workers were playful on weekdays, did not rest well after doing night work, and did not pay attention to maintaining their health, so they often asked for leave. The visitors explained the significance of increasing production and practicing economy and national industrialization in their talks with the workers; they expressed their cordial condolences to the workers who were on long leave and maternity leave, and helped them solve specific difficulties. After this visit, the attendance rate of the factory's workers has greatly improved, and the absentee rate of the whole factory in October has decreased by 10.43% (the plan stipulates 10.5%).
    Safety Exhibition
    The Southwest Branch of the Second Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Southwest Second Machinery Trade Union held an exhibition on improving safety technology and labor protection equipment in the 456 Factory on October 30. The exhibition was divided into three parts: the first part was models and real objects of improved safety equipment from various factories; the second part was safety labor protection equipment to protect the health of employees; the third part was accident photos and photos of improved safety equipment. The 20 models in the first part were all invented and created by the masses. The copper melting furnace in the 497 Factory used crucibles to melt copper. In the past, coal smoke, high temperature, and zinc oxide gas were the three major "hazards" to workers. Among 100 workers, more than 30 were often sick. After the major security inspection this spring, the workers of the copper melting group collectively studied and improved the furnace: the firepower was concentrated, and the smoke went out from five smoke outlets, no longer diffused everywhere. Since then, the workers' pains have been significantly reduced, and the attendance rate has always remained at 100%. The workers in a certain workshop plated the enamel of the products, which was often harmed by acid and alkali vapor, which made many workers sick. The workers in the enamel production group installed a metal automatic degassing hood above the enamel pool, which avoided the harm of acid and alkali gas to the workers. The punch press in the third workshop of the 152 Factory punched off the workers' fingers 13 times in 1952. Worker Hu Yun and technician Li Yaoxi cooperated to install a feeder on the punch press, which avoided the danger of punching fingers.
    The exhibition gave the workers a great education, and many workers wrote their opinions in the opinion book. The workers in the second workshop of the 456 Factory wrote: "From the safety exhibition, we can see that the wisdom of our workers is very great. In the increase production and practice economy campaign, we should think of ways to achieve safe production." Representatives from the 152 Factory and the 791 Factory said after the visit that they must do a good job in safe production after returning.

    工会在增产节约运动中
    交流工会小组工作经验
    旅大市工会联合会于十月十七日召开了全市各工厂工会小组长交流增产节约经验大会。会上由四个不同特点的小组做了典型经验介绍。大连起重机器厂谢在高小组介绍他们在讨论计划时，如何细查细挖，弄清关键问题，以及采用访问上一道工序，举办废品展览会的方法，解决了过去从未解决的许多质量上的关键问题。大连机车车辆制造工厂刘清和小组介绍了发动老技术工人讨论计划，把制订增产节约计划和编制作业计划结合起来的经验。大连中苏造船公司铆工第四小组介绍了他们加强检查工作，贯彻作业计划的经验。大连纺织厂舒光珠小组介绍了算前账算后账，进行技术标定，弄清关键，推广先进经验的经验。会后，各工会小组长普遍反映：“会议开得是时候，回去有办法了。”
    训练工会小组长
    国营青岛第五棉纺织厂工会为了保证增产节约运动顺利开展，在十月中旬用四天业余时间，一共六个小时，采取交流经验的方式对小组长进行了一次训练。在交流经验中，着重介绍了准备车间甲班络经二组，怎样全面完成第二、三季度计划的经验；和细纱车间乙班二组，怎样提高新工人技术全面完成计划的经验。小组长们听了这些经验，对工作有了信心。根据初步统计，在训练小组长以前，全厂只有三十个小组全面完成小组计划，现在已增加到五十个小组了。　（郝凯风）
    组织竞赛讲座
    太原市总工会为了克服部分厂矿订增产节约计划的形式主义偏向，贯彻增产节约与提高管理水平相结合的方针，于十月十七日组织了一次科室与小组如何发动群众制订增产节约计划开展竞赛的讲座。由太原矿山机器厂技术检查科和山西机器厂金工车间赵大庆小组的代表主讲。他们分别介绍了该科、组制订增产节约计划开展竞赛的经验。听讲的有太原市各厂矿工会干部与工程技术人员四百多人。会后，各厂矿代表都纷纷表示要学习这些经验，并检查与修订一次计划，使增产节约运动顺利开展。　（太原总工会办公室通讯组）
    参观先进经验表演
    沈阳市建筑工会为保证按期和提前完成今年基本建设任务，解决目前许多工地抹灰工不足，施工效率不高的问题，组织了九个单位的一百五十一名老技术工人、小组长、部分行政干部和工会干部到一○五工地和二○五工地，参观了李升华小组和贾元林小组等的先进操作方法的实际表演。同时并组织参观了先进经验照片展览会，由市劳动模范李升华介绍各种先进工具的操作方法，以及劳动组织的配备情况。
    参观的人都感觉到使用新工具，实行大流水作业是提高抹灰效率的好办法。尤其是他们看到了三十名徒工使用新工具就能完成一幢大楼的抹灰任务后，都一致反映：“真了不起呀！”老技工都表示回去要进一步推广抹灰先进经验。有的人参观后马上要先进工具的图纸，有的立即借用工具模型准备回去制做。有的当场学习操作。参观以后，还组织了座谈会，参观人员又进一步提出了有关劳动组织、先进工具等方面的改进意见。
    “闪电快报”
    山西机器厂金工车间，最近改进了黑板报，采用“闪电快报”，鼓舞职工生产情绪。“闪电快报”上制有两种图表，一种是表示每日生产进度情况的，一种是公布产品质量和废品的，都是每天填写。当日那个工人做出突出的成绩也写出来及时表扬。“闪电快报”自建立以来，把车间生产推进了一步。比如元车工人段正元做钻探机方轮，由四小时缩短到两小时半，车间记录员马上把这成绩写在快报上表扬，大家在中午休息时间就都看到了。段正元提高工作效率的信心更高了，到第二天他作活（衬套）时，学习了流水作业法，效率提高百分之三十，这个成绩当天又上了报。其他工人创造的不少新记录也都上了报。现在工人们下班后都要去看看快报，他们还编了个快板说：“闪电报，闪电报，当天事儿能知道，内容新鲜又扼要，争取天天把名报”。
  （刘佩琛、杨作樑）
    动员家属参加增产节约竞赛
    沈阳市总工会女工部为动员职工家属积极参加增产节约竞赛，进一步推广全国模范家属高凤琴小组经验，十月初召开了一次沈阳市职工家属代表会议。到会的有各厂家属委员会代表及小组长以上干部、积极分子共四百余人。
    会上由五三工厂和沈阳机车车辆修理厂家属委员会的代表，分别介绍了他们密切结合生产，有机地与各有关单位紧密联系，进行家属工作的经验。
    制订劳资生产合同
    北京私营初起造纸厂在增产节约运动开展以后，通过劳资协商会议，公开包销订货合同，经工会小组讨论研究，根据订货合同与自销计划，起草制订了劳资生产合同，并修订了合同签定前的生产计划。生产合同的签定大大提高了资方经营的积极性，资方副经理不仅到处购料和推销货物，还主动地与国营信托公司联系收购原料，在解决收购山西临汾二十万斤原料时，资方主动召开业务会议，并约请工会参加，提供意见。（于宏　单雷）
    亲切的访问
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂从今年一月到九月，都没有达到出勤率的计划指标。据统计，全厂工人停工总数已使国家损失近九万个工作日（长病假和产假不在内）。十月里，工会干部和全厂党、团员在国庆节放假的时候，有组织地到工人家中去访问。他们一共访问了八百个工人。据了解，过去有许多工人平日贪玩，做夜工后不好好休息，不注意保养身体，因此常常请假。去访问的人在和工人们谈心中，说明了增产节约和国家工业化的意义；对请长假和产假的工人进行了亲切的慰问，并帮助他们解决具体困难。经过这次访问，该厂的工人出勤率大大提高，十月份全厂缺勤率已降低百分之十点四三（计划规定十点五）。
    安全展览会
    第二机械工业部二局西南分局、西南第二机械工会，于十月三十日在四五六厂举办了一个改进安全技术及劳动保护设备展览会。展览会共分三个部分：第一部分是各厂改进安全设备的模型实物；第二部分是保护职工身体健康的安全劳动保护用具；第三部分是事故照片和安全设备改进照片。第一部分的二十件模型，都是群众发明创造的。四九七厂熔铜炉，是用坩锅熔铜，过去煤烟、高温、氧化锌气，是对工人的三大“毒害”。一百个工人中，经常有三十多人生病。今年春季保安大检查以后，熔铜小组的工人就集体研究，改进炉子：使火力集中，烟从五个烟口出去，不再到处弥漫，这以后工人的病痛显著减少，出勤率经常保持百分之百。某车间工人们镀产品的砝蓝，经常受酸碱蒸汽的危害，使得很多工人患病。砝蓝生产小组的工人，在砝蓝池的上面安放一个金属的自动除气罩，避免了工人受酸碱气的危害。一五二厂三车间冲床，在一九五二年内冲掉了工人的手指十三次。工人胡云和技术员李耀西合作，在冲床上加装一个送料器，这样就避免了冲指头的危险。
    展览会给工人们很大的教育，许多工人都在意见簿上写出自己的意见。四五六厂二车间工人写道：“从安全展览中，看出我们工人同志的智慧是很伟大的。在增产节约运动中，我们更应该想办法做到安全生产。”一五二厂、七九一厂的代表参观后，表示一定要回去搞好安全生产。
