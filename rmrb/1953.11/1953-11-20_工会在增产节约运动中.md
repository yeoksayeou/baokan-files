    Trade Unions in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Exchanging Work Experience of Trade Union Groups
    The Dalian-LÃ¼da Trade Union Federation convened a meeting of heads of trade union groups from all factories in the city on October 17 to exchange experiences in increasing production and practicing economy. At the meeting, four groups with different characteristics introduced their typical experiences. Xie Zai'gao's group from Dalian Crane Factory introduced how they carefully examined and delved into key issues during the discussion of plans, and how they solved many key quality problems that had never been solved in the past by visiting the previous work process and holding waste product exhibitions. Liu Qinghe's group from Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant introduced the experience of mobilizing veteran technical workers to discuss plans and combining the formulation of increase production and practice economy plans with the compilation of operation plans. The riveting fourth group of Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company introduced their experience in strengthening inspection work and implementing operation plans. Shu Guangzhu's group from Dalian Textile Factory introduced the experience of calculating pre-accounts and post-accounts, conducting technical calibration, clarifying key points, and promoting advanced experiences. After the meeting, the heads of the trade union groups generally reflected: "The meeting was held at the right time, and we have methods to use when we return."
    Training Trade Union Group Leaders
    In order to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the trade union of the state-owned Qingdao Fifth Cotton Textile Factory used four days of spare time in mid-October, a total of six hours, to train group leaders in an experience exchange format. During the experience exchange, the experience of how the Jia class warp winding group of the preparation workshop comprehensively completed the plans for the second and third quarters, and how the second group of the B class of the spinning workshop improved the skills of new workers and comprehensively completed the plans were emphasized. The group leaders gained confidence in their work after listening to these experiences. According to preliminary statistics, before training the group leaders, only 30 groups in the factory comprehensively completed their group plans, but now the number has increased to 50 groups.

    Organizing Competition Lectures
    In order to overcome the formalism tendency of some factories and mines in formulating increase production and practice economy plans, and to implement the policy of combining increase production and practice economy with improving management level, the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions organized a lecture on how offices and groups can mobilize the masses to formulate increase production and practice economy plans and carry out competitions on October 17. Representatives from the Technical Inspection Section of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and Zhao Daqing Group of the Metalworking Workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory were the main speakers. They introduced the experience of the section and group in formulating increase production and practice economy plans and carrying out competitions. More than 400 trade union cadres and engineering and technical personnel from various factories and mines in Taiyuan City attended the lecture. After the meeting, representatives from various factories and mines expressed that they would learn from these experiences and inspect and revise the plans to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    Visiting Advanced Experience Performances
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction tasks on schedule and ahead of schedule, and to solve the current problems of insufficient plasterers and low construction efficiency in many construction sites, the Shenyang City Construction Trade Union organized 151 veteran technical workers, group leaders, some administrative cadres and trade union cadres from nine units to visit the 105 construction site and the 205 construction site, and watched the actual performances of advanced operation methods by Li Shenghua's group and Jia Yuanlin's group, etc. At the same time, they also organized a visit to the advanced experience photo exhibition, and Li Shenghua, a model worker of the city, introduced the operation methods of various advanced tools and the allocation of labor organization.
    The visitors all felt that using new tools and implementing large-scale assembly line operations were good ways to improve plastering efficiency. Especially after seeing that 30 apprentices could complete the plastering task of a large building by using new tools, they all unanimously reflected: "It's really amazing!" The veteran technicians all expressed that they would further promote the advanced experience of plastering after returning. Some people asked for the drawings of advanced tools immediately after the visit, and some immediately borrowed tool models to prepare for making them. Some people learned to operate on the spot. After the visit, a forum was also organized, and the visitors further put forward improvement opinions on labor organization, advanced tools, etc.
    "Lightning Express"
    The metalworking workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory has recently improved the blackboard newspaper and adopted "Lightning Express" to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees. There are two kinds of charts on the "Lightning Express", one is to show the daily production progress, and the other is to announce the product quality and defective products, both of which are filled in every day. The outstanding achievements of the workers that day are also written out and praised in a timely manner. Since its establishment, the "Lightning Express" has promoted the production of the workshop. For example, Duan Zhengyuan, a worker of the Yuan class, shortened the time for making square wheels for drilling rigs from four hours to two and a half hours. The workshop recorder immediately wrote this achievement on the express report and praised it. Everyone saw it during the lunch break. Duan Zhengyuan's confidence in improving work efficiency was even higher. The next day, when he was working (sleeves), he learned the assembly line operation method, and the efficiency increased by 30%. This achievement was reported on the same day. Many new records created by other workers have also been reported. Now the workers have to go to see the express report after work. They also composed a clapper rhyme saying: "Lightning report, lightning report, you can know what happened on the same day, the content is fresh and concise, strive to report your name every day." (Liu Peichen, Yang Zuoliang)
    Mobilizing Family Members to Participate in Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition
    In order to mobilize the family members of employees to actively participate in the increase production and practice economy competition and further promote the experience of Gao Fengqin's group, a national model family member, the Women's Department of the Shenyang City Federation of Trade Unions held a representative meeting of family members of employees in Shenyang City in early October. There were more than 400 people attending the meeting, including representatives of family committees of various factories, cadres above the group leader level, and activists.
    At the meeting, representatives from the family committees of the 53rd Factory and the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory respectively introduced their experience in closely combining production, organically and closely contacting relevant units, and carrying out family work.
    Formulating Labor-Capital Production Contract
    After the start of the increase production and practice economy campaign, Beijing Private Chuxiang Paper Mill, through labor-capital consultation meetings, publicly contracted sales orders. After discussion and research by the trade union group, based on the sales order contract and self-sales plan, the labor-capital production contract was drafted and formulated, and the production plan before the contract was signed was revised. The signing of the production contract greatly improved the enthusiasm of the capitalist for management. The deputy manager of the capitalist not only purchased materials and promoted goods everywhere, but also took the initiative to contact the state-owned trust company to acquire raw materials. When solving the acquisition of 200,000 catties of raw materials in Linfen, Shanxi, the capitalist took the initiative to hold a business meeting and invited the trade union to participate and provide opinions. (Yu Hong, Shan Lei)
    Affectionate Visit
    From January to September this year, the state-owned Shanghai First Cotton Textile Factory failed to meet the planned target for attendance rate. According to statistics, the total number of workers' work stoppages in the factory has caused the state to lose nearly 90,000 workdays (excluding long-term sick leave and maternity leave). In October, trade union cadres and all party and League members in the factory visited workers' homes in an organized manner during the National Day holiday. They visited a total of 800 workers. It is understood that in the past, many workers were playful on weekdays, did not rest well after doing night work, and did not pay attention to maintaining their health, so they often asked for leave. The visitors explained the significance of increasing production and practicing economy and national industrialization in their talks with the workers; they expressed their cordial condolences to the workers who were on long leave and maternity leave, and helped them solve specific difficulties. After this visit, the attendance rate of the factory's workers has greatly improved, and the absentee rate of the whole factory in October has decreased by 10.43% (the plan stipulates 10.5%).
    Safety Exhibition
    The Southwest Branch of the Second Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Southwest Second Machinery Trade Union held an exhibition on improving safety technology and labor protection equipment in the 456 Factory on October 30. The exhibition was divided into three parts: the first part was models and real objects of improved safety equipment from various factories; the second part was safety labor protection equipment to protect the health of employees; the third part was accident photos and photos of improved safety equipment. The 20 models in the first part were all invented and created by the masses. The copper melting furnace in the 497 Factory used crucibles to melt copper. In the past, coal smoke, high temperature, and zinc oxide gas were the three major "hazards" to workers. Among 100 workers, more than 30 were often sick. After the major security inspection this spring, the workers of the copper melting group collectively studied and improved the furnace: the firepower was concentrated, and the smoke went out from five smoke outlets, no longer diffused everywhere. Since then, the workers' pains have been significantly reduced, and the attendance rate has always remained at 100%. The workers in a certain workshop plated the enamel of the products, which was often harmed by acid and alkali vapor, which made many workers sick. The workers in the enamel production group installed a metal automatic degassing hood above the enamel pool, which avoided the harm of acid and alkali gas to the workers. The punch press in the third workshop of the 152 Factory punched off the workers' fingers 13 times in 1952. Worker Hu Yun and technician Li Yaoxi cooperated to install a feeder on the punch press, which avoided the danger of punching fingers.
    The exhibition gave the workers a great education, and many workers wrote their opinions in the opinion book. The workers in the second workshop of the 456 Factory wrote: "From the safety exhibition, we can see that the wisdom of our workers is very great. In the increase production and practice economy campaign, we should think of ways to achieve safe production." Representatives from the 152 Factory and the 791 Factory said after the visit that they must do a good job in safe production after returning.
