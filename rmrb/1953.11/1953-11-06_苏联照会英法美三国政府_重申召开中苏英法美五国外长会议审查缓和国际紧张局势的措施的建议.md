Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th: The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States regarding the convening of a foreign ministers' conference.

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received on October 18 three identical notes from the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, which were replies to the Soviet government's note of September 28 regarding the issue of convening a four-power conference in Lugano on October 15.
    On November 3, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the Soviet government's reply notes to the embassies of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in Moscow.
    The following are the full texts of the British government's note of October 18, 1953, and the Soviet government's note of November 3, 1953.

    The British Government's Note of October 18, 1953

    The British Queen's Ambassador presents his compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and, upon the instructions of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has the honor to convey the following:

    1.  The Queen's Government, in close consultation with the Governments of the United States and France, has carefully studied the Soviet Government's reply of September 28 to the Western Three Powers' proposal for a four-power meeting at Lugano on October 15. Furthermore, consultations have taken place with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German authorities in Berlin.

    2.  The satisfactory resolution of the German and Austrian questions is clearly necessary for a genuine and lasting relaxation of international tension and is of great importance for the future of the peoples of those countries. The Queen's Government, recalling its notes of July 15 and September 2, firmly believes that real progress towards the solution of major international problems, including the question of European security, can be achieved by a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France to conduct a frank discussion of the German and Austrian questions, and not by further exchanges of notes. The Queen's Government believes that the Soviet note reflects its willingness to discuss these issues immediately.

    3.  Such a meeting would enable the Soviet Government to express any views it wishes to put forward on any aspect of the German and Austrian questions. As for the Queen's Government, it welcomes the opportunity to present its views on the issues it has raised in previous notes.

    4.  Regarding the Soviet suggestion to discuss the Austrian question through ordinary diplomatic channels, the Queen's Government believes that diplomatic channels have always been open, and the Queen's Government will continue to consider any suggestions from the Soviet Union regarding an Austrian treaty with extreme care.

    However, since no progress has been made through these channels in the past few years, the Queen's Government believes that a personal discussion by the four Foreign Ministers would be the most practical and feasible way to end the current deadlock and reach an agreement on a treaty.

    5.  The German and Austrian questions should have been resolved long ago. The Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, aware of the special responsibility their governments share with the Soviet Government on the German and Austrian questions, hope to discuss these issues with the Soviet Foreign Minister as soon as possible.

    The originally suggested date of October 15 has now passed, and therefore the Queen's Government suggests that the Foreign Ministers should meet in Lugano on November 9. They sincerely hope that the Soviet Government will agree to participate.

    6.  The Soviet note also suggests another five-power conference to discuss measures to ease international tensions. The Queen's Government is always willing to discuss the root causes of such tensions in order to eliminate them. However, it hopes to conduct such discussions under conditions that provide a reasonable hope of achieving positive results and ensure that the views of directly concerned governments can be adequately presented. Therefore, the Queen's Government has agreed to the form of the Korean political conference proposed by the communist side during the Korean armistice negotiations, recommended in the armistice agreement, and recommended by the United Nations General Assembly. It has been suggested that talks be held in Panmunjom to discuss the preparations for the conference. All five governments mentioned in the Soviet note can attend this conference. It is hoped that this conference can be held soon. The purpose of this conference is precisely to eliminate a major source of tension in the Far East, thereby paving the way for a peaceful resolution of other international problems currently existing in that region of the world as soon as possible.

    Other issues mentioned in the Soviet note, such as the issue of disarmament, are either currently under discussion in the United Nations General Assembly or are planned to be submitted for discussion. In fact, several issues mentioned in the Soviet note have recently been included on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly at the request of the Soviet Union. In addition, the Queen's Government remains prepared to discuss any issue that any government wishes to raise through the usual diplomatic channels.

    7.  Therefore, for all these issues, the path to progress is open. Furthermore, if a fruitful discussion can be held in Lugano now, it would prepare the necessary conditions for discussing other major issues and restoring international peace and friendly relations.

    The Soviet Government's Note of November 3, 1953

    The Soviet Government hereby notifies that it has received the British Government's reply of October 18 to the Soviet Government's note of September 28.

    The British Government's note of October 18, like the previous note (the note of September 2), avoids addressing many important issues raised by the Soviet Government, the discussion of which would have helped resolve international outstanding issues and consolidate peace. Moreover, the need to resolve these outstanding issues is even more pressing than before.

    At the same time, one cannot ignore that the British Government's note is also the result of a unilateral agreement among the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. From this, it appears that the recent London Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, like the previous Washington Conference, has not contributed to the resolution of international outstanding issues at all. On the contrary, these conferences only undermine the initiatives and possibilities for reaching agreements among the countries concerned, which is naturally contrary to the interests of international cooperation.

    In its note of September 28, the Soviet Government drew the attention of the British Government, as well as the governments of the United States and France, to the necessity for the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union to study measures to ease international tensions. The Soviet Government's approach was based on the fact that the governments of the aforementioned countries also expressed their willingness to reach agreements so that international tensions could be eased in the near future, thereby making it possible to achieve positive results in resolving pressing international issues. The Soviet Government put forward this proposal on the premise that a favorable atmosphere has now been created to facilitate this, especially due to the realization of the Korean armistice.

    Everyone knows what a positive impact the actions of the Government of the People's Republic of China had on facilitating the realization of the Korean armistice. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demonstrated initiative, contributing to the agreement to end the Korean war. Therefore, it is only natural to hope that the parties concerned will take further steps to ease international tensions. One can only consider that refusing to discuss the issue of easing international tensions is unwillingness to promote the resolution of outstanding issues, and unwillingness to work to strengthen peace and international security.

    One of the main factors indicating the extreme tension in international relations is that in recent years, the work of expanding armaments—including atomic and hydrogen weapons—has been increasingly intensified, military blocs directed against other countries have been formed, and the network of military bases built by certain countries on foreign territories is rapidly expanding, and so on. If the British Government, like the Soviet Government, also recognizes that this situation increases the risk of another world war, and recognizes that discussions on the above-mentioned exceptionally important international issues should not be postponed indefinitely, then it should not oppose immediately discussing measures to ease international tensions. Otherwise, it is impossible to provide the conditions for resolving pressing international issues, to which the British Government also attaches great importance.

    In its note of October 18, the British Government mentioned that certain issues referred to in the Soviet Government's note of September 28, including the issue of disarmament, are currently under discussion in the United Nations General Assembly or are planned to be submitted for discussion. However, we believe that this argument is untenable in the slightest. Since its establishment, the United Nations has been discussing some important issues concerning the maintenance of international peace. This primarily refers to issues such as the reduction and regulation of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the prohibition of the establishment of military bases on foreign territories, and the prohibition of propaganda for the preparation of another world war. However, everyone knows that the resolution of these important issues has encountered serious difficulties in the United Nations. As a result, the arms race conducted by certain countries has not only not been eased but has continued on a larger scale, thus, the tax burden imposed on the broad masses of people in these countries is increasing day by day. On the other hand, the destructiveness and danger of weapons of mass slaughter are increasing day by day, especially after the emergence of the hydrogen bomb.

    A thorough resolution of the Korean question is extremely important for easing international tensions. At present, in order to achieve this, it is necessary to resolve the issue of the unification of Korea and the establishment of lasting peace in Korea on the basis of the armistice that has been achieved. The convening of a political conference on the Korean question should be in line with these goals.

    The Soviet Government already pointed out in its note of September 28 that the convening of this conference has encountered serious difficulties in the discussion of the issue of the members of the conference. There are still those who clearly underestimate the importance of reaching agreements on this issue with such directly related countries as the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It should be quite clear that whether the political conference on the Korean question can succeed largely depends on the agreement on actions between the directly concerned parties, and depends on the participation of other neutral countries that have contributed to the realization of the Korean armistice and can practically help solve the entire Korean question.

    According to the understanding that has been reached, a meeting is being held in Panmunjom to discuss the unresolved issues regarding the preparation of the political conference on the Korean question. If the United States government and the governments of certain other countries that have created difficulties in resolving the Korean question, especially difficulties in resolving the issue of the members of the conference, truly hope for the success of the conference, they would not fail to consider the above-mentioned legitimate demands of the Korean and Chinese sides, which, as demonstrated by the discussions on the issue of the members of the political conference at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, are supported by the majority of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.

    The easing of international tensions also greatly depends on the adjustment of relations with the People's Republic of China, the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and the participation of China in resolving major issues related to the maintenance of peace and international security. Ignoring the necessity of immediately resolving the issue of restoring the national interests of the People's Republic of China and not allowing China to fully and equally participate in the work of resolving pressing international issues is an attempt to maintain an atmosphere of international tension. One cannot simply view the issue as being resolved simply by having the People's Republic of China participate in the Korean question conference, because whether the conference can achieve positive results also depends to a considerable extent on recognizing the rights and legitimate interests of the Chinese people in resolving other important international issues. The aggressive actions taken by certain countries against the People's Republic of China over the years should also be considered impermissible phenomena.

    From the above, it can be seen that in order to resolve the pressing international issues that are extremely important for easing international tensions—not to mention the specific issues regarding the situation in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region—it is urgently necessary to hold a five-power foreign ministers' conference of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union.

    In reply to the Soviet government's proposal to convene a five-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss measures to ease international tensions, the British government announced that it was willing to discuss the root causes of this tension in order to eliminate these causes. However, the British government said: "It hopes to conduct such discussions under conditions that provide a reasonable hope of achieving positive results and ensure that the views of directly concerned governments can be adequately presented."

    In this way, on the one hand, the British government said that it was willing to discuss the root causes of the current international tension in order to eliminate them, while at the same time immediately refusing to hold a five-nation conference at present. This can be seen from the fact that the British government put forward various preconditions aimed at postponing this conference indefinitely. If the British government continues to insist on these preconditions, it can be explained that in practice, the British government is not committed to easing international tensions, and correspondingly to resolving unresolved international issues.

    In refusing to convene a five-nation conference, the British government pointed out that it had agreed to hold a political conference on the Korean question, in which all these countries could participate. However, the British government's statement is groundless, judging from the attitude taken by the British government—refusing to allow neutral countries to participate in this conference to discuss the Korean issue—which makes it impossible for the Soviet Union to participate in the aforementioned conference. One cannot ignore the fact that it is not possible to discuss the issue of generally easing international tensions at this conference discussing the Korean issue, and at present, it is necessary to immediately discuss this issue.

    In its note of September 28, the Soviet government called attention to the fact that the recent political developments in West Germany have made the peace-loving countries of Europe even more uneasy.

    The West German ruling clique has openly set for itself the goal of accelerating the completion of its plan for rearmament.

    Measures to establish regular land, air, and naval forces have been implemented. Hundreds of factories have been converted to war production. The West German monopoly capitalists who once supported Hitler's aggression are working to restore the war industry. The generals who built Hitler's army and implemented Hitler's war plans are once again taking on the leadership responsibility for building West German armed forces. The current Bonn government, representing the desires of the aggressive group composed of West German monopoly capitalists and the Hitler military leadership, no longer considers it necessary to conceal its aggressive conspiracies against neighboring countries. Those who rule West Germany openly declare their revanchist plans, which pose an increasingly serious threat to European security. The recently exposed malicious West German revanchists are seeking to gain the support of aggressors from other countries.

    Under these circumstances, it is impossible not to see the danger implied by the wishes of the West German ruling group, which hopes to promote the ratification and entry into force of the Paris and Bonn treaties as soon as possible by all possible means. Their wishful thinking of accelerating West German militarization and realizing their revanchist plans in Europe is closely related to these two treaties.

    Under these circumstances, the recent blatant pressure used to force France to quell popular opposition to the Bonn and Paris treaties should be considered particularly impermissible.

    Because the Paris treaty on the so-called European Army—into which West German armed forces will be drawn—means the establishment of a regular army in West Germany, West German revanchists are doing everything possible to make this treaty effective. At the same time, West Germany's revanchist group is constantly applying pressure to make the Bonn treaty effective as soon as possible. They intend to use this treaty—which will make West Germany a country under occupation for decades—to join the North Atlantic Treaty military group and, after obtaining the support of the group's most ferocious aggressive forces, to unite again.

    The entry into force of the Paris and Bonn treaties will mean that the work of West Germany's re-militarization will be carried out with all its strength. At that time, based on the bitter experience of the people of European countries in the past, West German revanchists will no longer abide by many of the clauses of these treaties. At that time, they will use all means to drag the signatory countries of these treaties into adventurous actions that can help them launch wars in order to achieve their criminal revanchist goals.

    The peace-loving people of European countries, especially West Germany's neighbors, cannot ignore this. Everyone knows the lessons of history: the first to suffer at the hands of aggressive German militarists were its neighbors, against whom German militarists have always fabricated excuses to launch attacks at will.

    Therefore, it is understandable why the British government's note of October 18 mentioned such an important issue as European security. The Soviet government has always attached great importance to this issue. It must be recognized that only by resolving the German question in a way that guarantees Germany's unification into a democratic and peace-loving country, while guaranteeing the interests of the security of European countries, can it be in line with the interests of the peace-loving people of European countries and in line with the interests of the German people themselves. This means that a military group of a separate European country established to confront other European countries, like the so-called European Army currently being established, is incompatible with the true security of Europe.

    At the same time, one must never forget the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 and the Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944, in which the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union and France, have undertaken obligations to take joint measures to eliminate the possibility of new aggression by German militarism—which is also in line with the purpose of ensuring the security of European countries. It would not be good for the United Kingdom and France to forget these important obligations. As for the Soviet Union, it does not intend to weaken these obligations now or in the past, and it is willing to consider any new opportunities that are sufficient to ensure European security.

    However, according to the opinions expressed by the British government in the above-mentioned note and in several previous notes, the British government's attitude on the German question can hardly be said to be in line with the interests of guaranteeing European security, because it not only ignores the above-mentioned obligations, but also ignores the resolutions of the Potsdam Conference of 1945, according to which the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and later France, which acceded to it, unanimously agreed to work together to promote Germany's reunification, the establishment of an all-German democratic government, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet government considers it necessary to once again draw the British government's attention to the fact that in order to ensure European security, it is very important to abide by the principles and purposes of the Potsdam Agreement on the German question.

    The Soviet government still believes, as it always has, that only through the joint efforts of the four major powers is it possible to ensure European security and prevent the revival of German aggressive militarism, which West German revanchists are currently striving to achieve. The United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union must, together with representatives from East and West Germany, agree on no longer delaying the resolution of various major issues related to Germany in order to consolidate peace and European security: concluding a peace treaty with Germany and restoring Germany's unity in accordance with democratic and peaceful guidelines.

    It is for the above-mentioned reasons that the Soviet government proposes discussing the following issues at the Foreign Ministers' Conference:

    Convening a peace conference to discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Germany;

    Establishing a provisional all-German government and holding all-German elections.

    In addition, the Soviet government has always believed that it is necessary to discuss the issue of lifting Germany from the financial and economic obligations imposed on it as a result of the war.

    As in the past, the British government in its note of October 18 also did not express its views on these issues that are of extreme importance to the resolution of the German question. It merely said that at the aforementioned meeting, the British government "welcomes the opportunity to present its views on the issues it has raised in previous notes."

    The British government's words mean that it still, as in the past, strives to reduce the discussion of the issue of a peace treaty with Germany to the issue of all-German elections organized by the occupying authorities rather than by the German people themselves, because the British government still evades in many ways its unwillingness to consider the issue of urgently establishing an all-German democratic government. However, without establishing such an all-German government, it is impossible to guarantee truly free all-German elections, and it is impossible to guarantee the completion of the major task stipulated by the Four-Power Potsdam Agreement: to promote Germany's restoration as a peace-loving and democratic country.

    In addition, the study of the German question cannot be separated from other major issues that are directly related to European security: the issue of the situation caused by the continuous expansion of the network of military bases by the United States within the territory of certain European countries.

    As the Soviet government has constantly pointed out, most of these military bases are located in areas adjacent to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which shows that these bases are not fundamentally for the purpose of defending the countries of the North Atlantic group, but for aggressive purposes. Everyone knows that the United States has established such bases in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Turkey, Norway, and some other countries. Just recently, an agreement was also signed to establish US military bases in Greek territory, which is completely inconsistent with the national interests of the Greek people. Another fact is enough to illustrate to what extent the United States intends to establish military bases in Europe: recently, the United States and Franco's Spain, a former accomplice of Hitler's Germany, signed an agreement, and this country is being turned into a military ally of the North Atlantic countries and is allowing the United States to establish naval and air force bases on its territory. Seeing these many new facts, no one can say that the North Atlantic group has defensive purposes.

    In addition, certain European countries and countries in the Middle East and Near East, especially Iran, are constantly being subjected to open pressure, forcing them to allow foreign countries to establish military bases on their territory, regardless of the legitimate protests of the broad masses of people in these countries, who recognize that the establishment of such bases is for aggressive purposes and is absolutely incompatible with their national sovereignty and independence.

    The establishment of the above-mentioned military bases is directly related to the current measures to re-militarize West Germany, which aims to turn West Germany into a place for formulating and implementing the revanchist plans of West German militarists, and for formulating and implementing the aggressive conspiracies of the North Atlantic group.

    It is not difficult to understand that the security of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is threatened in the context of the continuous establishment of new foreign military bases in many countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East and Near East, and that the plan to re-militarize Germany is being implemented. This further exacerbates international tensions and strengthens the threat of another world war.

    All this shows that in order to resolve the German question in accordance with the interests of European security, it is necessary to resolve the issue of canceling the above-mentioned military bases. Any other attitude towards this issue is equivalent to ignoring the interests of truly ensuring European security.

    In view of this, the Soviet government hopes that the British government, as well as the governments of the United States and France, will explain that since they have expressed their willingness to discuss the German question at the Four-Power Conference and recognize the necessity of ensuring European security, does that mean that they do not intend to both propose to discuss the German question at the conference and at the same time take measures to require the countries that have not yet ratified the Paris and Bonn treaties to ratify these two treaties. Such an explanation is necessary, because if the above-mentioned treaties are ratified and put into effect, Germany will no longer be able to be restored as a unified country, and discussing the German question at the Four-Power Conference will lose its meaning, because then the conference will be bound by the obligations pre-agreed by the three countries and Adenauer's Bonn government, which is to pull West Germany into the North Atlantic Group and establish an army of West German revanchists.

    All of the above shows that if there is a genuine desire to resolve pressing international issues, then everyone needs to agree to immediately study measures to ease international tensions, which requires holding a conference of the five major powers. It can be hoped that the examination of the above-mentioned measures will also make the German question easier to resolve, and it is clear that the resolution of the German question is closely related to the issue of ensuring European security.

    Therefore, the Soviet government reaffirms the proposal made in its note of September 28, namely, to convene a foreign ministers' conference, at which:

    1. The Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union will review measures to ease international tensions.

    2. The Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union will discuss the German question, including all the proposals put forward in the preparation process for the conference.

    As for the issue of the Austrian Peace Treaty mentioned by the British government, the Soviet government believes that it must be pointed out that it is awaiting a reply from the British government, as well as from the French and US governments, to its note of August 28 on this issue, and declares that the method proposed by the Soviet government to discuss this issue through ordinary diplomatic channels has not yet been implemented.

    The Soviet government also sent the same note to the French government and the United States government.

    苏联照会英法美三国政府
    重申召开中苏英法美五国外长会议审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：苏联政府就召开外长会议问题致英、法、美三国政府的照会。
    苏联外交部于十月十八日收到英、法、美三国政府内容相同的照会三份，是对苏联政府九月二十八日关于召开外长会议问题一照会的答复。
    十一月三日，苏联外交部把苏联政府的复照送交英、法、美三国驻莫斯科大使馆。
    以下为英国政府一九五三年十月十八日的照会以及苏联政府一九五三年十一月三日的照会全文。
    英国政府一九五三年十月十八日的照会
    英国女王大使谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长致意，并奉女王外交大臣的指示谨转达以下事项：
    一、女王政府照例在与美国和法国政府密切磋商之下，仔细地研究了九月二十八日苏联政府对西方三国提出的关于十月十五日在流茄诺举行四国会议的建议所作的答复。此外，还与德意志联邦共和国政府和柏林的德国当局进行了磋商。
    二、满意地解决德国和奥地利问题，对于真正而持久地缓和国际紧张局势显然是很必要的，而且对于这些国家的人民前途是非常重要的。女王政府回想它在七月十五日和九月二日提出的照会，坚决认为，要使包括欧洲安全问题在内的重大国际问题的解决获得真正的进展，可由美国、苏联、联合王国与法国的外交部长举行会议，对德国和奥地利问题进行坦率的讨论，而不能依靠再行交换照会。女王政府相信，苏联的照会反映了它愿意马上讨论这些问题。
    三、这种会议可以使苏联政府就德国和奥地利问题的任何方面发表它愿意提出的意见。至于女王政府，它欢迎有机会对它在以前的照会中谈到的问题提出它的意见。
    四、苏联建议用普通的外交途径讨论奥地利问题，关于这一点，女王政府认为，外交途径始终洞开着，女王政府将继续极度仔细地考虑苏联这样提出的关于对奥和约的任何建议。
    但是，由于在过去几年中，通过这些途径并没有作出任何进展，因此女王政府认为，四外长亲自来讨论，将是结束目前的僵局和对一项条约达致协定的最实际可行的办法。
    五、德国和奥地利问题早就应该解决了。美国、联合王国和法国的外长意识到他们的政府和苏联政府一起在德国和奥地利问题上所负的特殊责任，因此希望能尽快地和苏联外长在一起讨论这些问题。
    原先建议的十月十五日这个日期现在已经过去了，因此女王政府建议，外长们应在十一月九日在流茄诺举行会议。他们诚恳地希望苏联政府将会同意参加。
    六、苏联的照会也建议另外举行一个五国会议，以讨论缓和国际间紧张关系的措施。女王政府随时都愿意讨论这种紧张局势的根本原因，以便消除这种紧张局势。但是，它希望在这样的条件下来进行讨论，这种条件能提供获致积极结果的合理希望，并保证直接有关政府的意见能适当地提出。因此，女王政府已同意共方在朝鲜停战谈判中提出的以及在停战协定中建议的并且由联合国大会建议的那种形式的朝鲜政治会议。已经建议：在板门店举行会谈，以讨论会议的筹备事宜。苏联照会中提到的所有五国政府，都可以出席这个会议。希望这个会议能早日举行。这个会议的目的正是在于消除远东紧张局势的一个重大根源，从而开辟道路，以使世界这个地区目前存在的其他国际问题早日获得和平解决。
    苏联照会中提到的其他问题，例如裁减军备问题，有的已在联合国大会目前讨论之列，有的已计划提出讨论。事实上，苏联照会中提到的若干问题，最近应苏联的要求，已经列入联合国大会本届会议的议程。此外，女王政府仍然准备通过通常外交途径讨论任何政府想提出的任何问题。
    七、因此，对于所有这些问题来说，获得进展的途径是开敞着的。此外，如果现在能在流茄诺举行一次有结果的讨论，那就会为讨论其他重大问题和恢复国际和平与友好关系的必要条件做好准备。
    苏联政府一九五三年十一月三日的照会
    苏联政府谨通知：已收到英国政府十月十八日对苏联政府九月二十八日照会的复文。
    英国政府十月十八日的照会，像前一照会（九月二日的照会）一样，避免谈到苏联政府提出的许多重要问题，本来讨论这些问题就会有助于解决国际悬案，巩固和平。何况，解决这些悬案的需要比以前更为迫切了。
    同时，不能无视英国政府的这个照会也是英、法、美三国片面协议的结果。由此看来，最近的伦敦三国外长会议，像前一次华盛顿会议一样，完全没有促进国际悬案的解决。相反的，这些会议只会破坏有关国家间达成协议的倡议与可能性，而这自然是与国际合作的利益相背的。
    苏联政府在九月二十八日的照会中曾提请英国政府以及美国和法国政府注意有必要由英国、法国、美国、中华人民共和国和苏联的外交部长研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施。苏联政府这样做法的根据是上述国家的政府也表示愿意达成协议，俾使国际紧张局势在最近的将来就能缓和，从而有可能在解决国际迫切问题方面得到积极结果。苏联政府提出这个建议是根据这个前提，即：现在已经创造了便于这样做的有利气氛，特别是由于朝鲜停战的实现。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国政府的行动对促使朝鲜停战实现发生了怎么样的积极影响，中华人民共和国政府与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表现了主动性，促成了结束朝鲜流血战争的协议。因此，要希望有关双方采取进一步的步骤来缓和国际紧张局势，那是完全自然的。大家只能认为，拒绝讨论缓和国际紧张局势问题，就是不愿意促使悬而未决的问题得到解决，就是不愿意致力来加强和平与国际安全。
    表明国际关系非常紧张的主要因素之一是：最近一些年来，扩充军备——包括原子武器与氢武器在内——的工作越来越加紧地进行，某些国家对付其它国家的军事集团已在形成，某些国家在外国领土上建筑的军事基地网正迅速扩大等等。如果英国政府像苏联政府一样，也认识到这种局势增加了爆发另一次世界大战的危险，认识到关于上述异常重大的国际问题的讨论不应无限期延宕下去，那么就不应该反对立即讨论缓和国际紧张局势的措施。否则就不可能提供解决迫切国际问题的条件，而这些问题的解决，英国政府也是很重视的。
    英国政府在十月十八日的照会中提到，苏联政府九月二十八日的照会中提到的某些问题，包括裁减军备问题在内，正在联合国大会目前讨论之列，或已计划提出讨论。但是，这个论据我们认为丝毫不能成立。联合国自从成立以来一直就在讨论某些关于维护国际和平的重要问题。这首先是指的这样一些问题，像裁减并规定军备，禁用原子武器和其他大规模毁灭武器，禁止在外国领土上建立军事基地，禁止为准备另一次世界大战进行宣传。但是，大家知道，这些重要问题的解决在联合国碰到了严重的困难。结果，某些国家进行的扩军运动不但没有缓和下来，而且在更大的规模上继续着，因此，压在这些国家广大阶层人民身上的捐税负担日益加重，另一方面，大规模屠杀武器的破坏性和危险性一天比一天增加，尤其是在氢弹出现之后。
    朝鲜问题的彻底解决对于缓和国际紧张局势是十分重要的。在目前，要做到这样，就需要在已实现的停战的基础上解决朝鲜的统一以及在朝鲜建立持久和平的问题。朝鲜问题政治会议的召开应该符合于这些目标。
    苏联政府在九月二十八日的照会中已经指出，这个会议的召开在讨论会议的成员问题上遭到了严重的困难。仍然有人显然低估了与中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国这样一些直接有关国家在这个问题上取得协议的行动的重要性。朝鲜问题政治会议是否能够成功，大部分决定于直接有关双方的关于行动的协议，决定于其他曾经促成朝鲜停战实现并能实际帮助解决整个朝鲜问题的中立国家参加这个会议，这应该是十分明显的。
    根据已经达成的谅解，正在板门店举行会议，讨论关于筹备朝鲜问题政治会议的未决问题。如果美国政府和某些给解决朝鲜问题造成困难、尤其是给解决会议成员问题造成困难的其他国家的政府真正希望会议成功，它们就不会不考虑朝中方面的上述正当要求，这些要求，如联合国大会第七届会议关于政治会议成员问题的讨论情况所表明的，是受到欧、亚、非三洲大多数国家的支持的。
    国际紧张局势的缓和，也大有赖于调整与中华人民共和国的关系，恢复中国在联合国的合法权利以及在解决与维护和平和国际安全有关的重大问题时要有中国参加。无视立即解决关于恢复中华人民共和国的民族利益问题的必要性，不让中国充分地、平等地参加解决国际迫切问题的工作，就是设法维持国际紧张气氛。不能把问题简单看成只要中华人民共和国参加朝鲜问题会议就算完事，因为会议是否能取得积极结果，在不小的程度上也系于承认中国人民在解决其他重要国际问题方面的权利与合法利益。这些年来，某些国家对中华人民共和国干出了一些侵略举动，这也应该认为是不能容许的现象。
    从以上所述可以看出，为了解决对缓和国际紧张局势极为重要的迫切的国际问题——先不谈关于东南亚与太平洋区域国家的形势的具体问题——举行英国、法国、美国、中华人民共和国和苏联五国外长会议是有迫切必要的。
    在答复苏联政府提出的召开五国外长会议来讨论缓和国际紧张局势的措施的时候，英国政府宣布愿意讨论造成这种紧张局势的根本原因，以便消除这些原因。不过英国政府说：“它希望在这样的条件下来进行讨论，这种条件能提供获致积极结果的合理希望，并保证直接有关政府的意见能适当地提出。”
    这样，英国政府一方面说愿意讨论造成目前国际紧张局势的根本原因，以消除它们，而同时又立刻拒绝在目前举行五国会议。这可以从一个事实看出来，即英国政府提出了种种目的在无限期地推迟这个会议的先决条件。假如英国政府继续坚持这些先决条件的话，就可说明在实际上，英国政府并不在致力于缓和国际紧张局势，相应地解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    英国政府在拒绝召开五国会议的时候指出，它已经同意举行朝鲜问题政治会议，而这个会议是所有这些国家都能参加的。但是，仅从英国政府所采取的态度——拒绝中立国家参加这个讨论朝鲜问题的会议——使得苏联不可能参加上述会议这一点来看，英国政府的这种说法就是毫无根据的。也不能忽视这一点，即：在这个讨论朝鲜问题的会议上，没有可能讨论总的缓和国际紧张局势问题，而在目前，却又不能不立刻讨论这个问题。
    苏联政府在九月二十八日的照会中曾要求注意这个事实，即西德最近的政治局势发展已使欧洲爱好和平国家更加感到不安。
    西德统治集团已公开为自己规定了加速完成重新军国主义化计划的目标。
    建立正规的陆军、空军、海军的措施已经执行。几百个工厂已转入战争生产。在过去曾支持希特勒进行侵略的西德垄断资本家正致力于恢复战争工业。曾建立希特勒军队并执行希特勒的战争计划的将领们正又担负起建立西德武装部队的领导责任来。目前的波恩政府代表着西德垄断资本家和希特勒军人领导集团组成的侵略集团的愿望，已不再认为有必要来掩饰它对邻国的侵略阴谋了。统治西德的人公开宣布他们的复仇主义计划，这对欧洲的安全造成了日益严重的威胁。最近已露恶意的西德复仇主义者正在设法取得其它国家侵略分子的支持。
    在这种情况下，要不看到西德统治集团的愿望所意味的危险是不可能的，西德统治集团希望以一切可能的办法来促使巴黎和波恩条约尽快得到批准并生效，他们的加速西德军国主义化并实现他们在欧洲的复仇主义计划的如意算盘，是与这两个条约密切相关的。
    在这种情况下，应该认为最近用来迫使法国平息人民对波恩和巴黎条约的反对的粗暴压力是特别不能容许的。
    由于关于所谓欧洲军——其中将拉进西德武装部队——的巴黎条约意味着在西德建立正规军，西德复仇主义者正不择一切手段来使这个条约生效。同时西德的复仇主义集团也不断施用压力来使波恩条约尽快生效。他们打算利用这个条约——这个条约将使西德在几十年中间沦于被占领国家地位——，在加入北大西洋国家军事集团并得到这个集团最凶恶的侵略力量的支持以后，再联合起来。
    巴黎和波恩条约的生效将意味着西德的重新军国主义化工作将以全力来进行了。到那个时候，根据欧洲各国人民过去的惨痛经验，西德复仇主义者就不会再恪守这些条约中的许多条款了。到那个时候，他们将用尽一切方法来把这些条约的签字国拖进能帮助他们发动战争的冒险行动中去，以达到他们罪恶的复仇主义目的。
    欧洲各国爱好和平的人民，首先是西德的邻国不能忽视这一点。每个人都知道历史的教训：在侵略性的德国军国主义者手里第一个遭殃的就是它的邻国，对这些国家，德国军国主义者向来是随意捏造借口就发动进攻的。
    因此，很可以理解到，为什么英国政府十月十八日的照会提到了像欧洲安全这样的重要问题。对这个问题，苏联政府一向是非常重视的。必须认识到，只有用保证德国统一成为一个民主和爱好和平的国家，同时保证欧洲各国安全的利益的方法来解决德国问题，才能符合欧洲各国爱好和平人民的利益又符合德国人民本身的利益。这就是说，为对付其他欧洲国家而建立的一个单独的欧洲国家的军事集团，像目前正在建立的所谓欧洲军，是与欧洲的真正的安全不相容的。
      同时也决不能忘记一九四二年的英苏条约和一九四四年的法苏条约，在这些条约中，苏联与英国，以及苏联与法国已经承担义务，要采取共同的措施来消除德国军国主义进行新侵略的可能性——这也是符合于保证欧洲各国安全的目的的。英国和法国要是忘记这些重要的义务，对它们是没有好处的。至于苏联，它现在和过去一样，不仅不打算削弱这些义务，而且凡有足以保证欧洲安全的新的机会，它一概愿意加以考虑。
    然而，根据英国政府在上述照会以及以前好几次照会中所表示的意见，英国政府在德国问题上的态度一点也谈不上符合保障欧洲安全的利益，因为它不仅忽视了上述义务，而且忽视了一九四五年波茨坦会议的决议，按照这些决议，英国、美国、苏联以及其后附署的法国一致同意大家共同努力，促使德国恢复统一，成立全德民主政府并缔结对德和约。苏联政府认为必须再次提请英国政府注意，为了保障欧洲的安全，遵守关于德国问题的波茨坦协议的原则和宗旨乃是非常重要的。
    苏联政府还是像向来一样地认为，只有四大国共同努力，才有可能保障欧洲的安全，制止西德复仇主义者目前那样竭力争取实现的德国侵略性军国主义的复活。英国、法国、美国和苏联必须与东西德代表一起，为了巩固和平及欧洲的安全，协议不再拖延解决关于德国的各项有关重大问题：缔结对德和约，按照民主与和平的方针恢复德国的统一。
    正是为了上述原因，苏联政府建议在外长会议上讨论下面这样一些问题：
    召开和会，讨论对德和约问题；
    成立全德临时政府并举行全德选举。
    除此之外，苏联政府向来认为必须讨论关于解除德国由于战争后果而负担的财政和经济义务问题。
    正如过去一样，英国政府在它十月十八日的照会中也没有对这些与德国问题的解决有极端重大关系的问题表示意见。它仅仅说，在上述会议上英国政府“欢迎有机会对它在以前的照会中谈到的问题提出它的意见”。
    英国政府这段话意思就是说，它仍然像以往一样，竭力把讨论对德和约的问题化为由占领当局组织的而不是由德国人民自己组织的全德选举的问题，因为英国政府直到现在仍然多方规避，不愿意审议关于赶紧成立全德民主政府的问题。可是，要不成立这样一个全德政府，就不可能保证举行真正自由的全德选举，就不可能保证完成四国波茨坦协议所规定的重大任务：促使德国恢复为一个爱好和平和民主的国家。
    此外，研究德国问题，也离不开其他一些跟欧洲安全有直接关系的重大问题：由于美国在某些欧洲国家的领土内不断扩大军事基地网而引起的局势的问题。
    如苏联政府一向不断指出的一样，这些军事基地大多设于邻近苏联及各人民民主国家的地区，这件事就说明了这些基地根本不是为了保卫北大西洋集团国家，而是用于侵略目的的。大家都知道，美国在英国、法国、意大利、土耳其、挪威和其他一些国家，都设有这种基地。就在最近，还订了一个在希腊领土上设立美国军事基地的协定，这是完全不符合希腊人民的民族利益的。另外一个事实也足以说明美国打算在欧洲设立军事基地的努力到底到了怎样一种地步：最近美国和希特勒德国过去的帮凶佛朗哥西班牙签订了一个协定，这个国家正被变成北大西洋国家集团的军事盟国，并让美国在它的领土上建立海空军基地。眼看着这许多新的事实，谁也不能说北大西洋集团抱着防御目的。
    除此之外，对于某些欧洲国家以及中近东国家，特别是伊朗，还不断地加以公开的压力，强迫它们让外国在它们的领土上设立军事基地，不顾这些国家广大群众的理所当然的抗议，这些国家的人民认识到，建立这样的基地是为了侵略目的，与它们本国的民族主权和独立绝不相容。
    建立上述的军事基地，和目前使西德重新军国主义化的措施有直接的关系，这个措施目的在于把西德变成一个制订和执行西德军国主义者的复仇主义计划的地点，变成制订和执行北大西洋集团的侵略阴谋的地点。
    不难了解，在欧洲、北非和中近东许多国家内不断地设立起新的外国军事基地、使德国重新军国主义化的计划正在实行的情况下，苏联以及各人民民主国家的安全受到了威胁，这使得国际紧张局势进一步恶化，并加强另一次世界大战的威胁。
    这一切都说明，要想按照欧洲安全的利益来解决德国问题，就一定要解决取消上述军事基地的问题。对于这个问题采取任何其他态度，都等于忽视真正保障欧洲安全的利益。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府希望英国政府以及美、法两国政府说明，它们既经表示愿意在四大国会议上讨论德国问题，并承认保障欧洲安全的必要，那是否就是说它们不打算既建议在会议上讨论德国问题而同时又采取措施，要求尚未批准巴黎和波恩条约的国家批准这两个条约。这样一种说明是必要的，因为上述条约若获得批准并付诸实行，德国就再也不可能恢复为一个统一的国家，在四国会议上讨论德国问题也就失去了意义，因为那时会议将受到三国和阿登纳的波恩政府事前就约定了的义务的束缚，这种义务就是把西德拉进北大西洋集团，并成立一支西德复仇主义的军队。
    上述一切都说明，若是真正有诚意要解决迫切的国际问题，那就需要大家同意立刻研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施，这就要求举行五大国的会议。可以希望，通过对上述措施的审查也将使德国问题比较容易解决，而很明显的，德国问题的解决与保证欧洲安全问题是有密切的关系的。
    因此，苏联政府重申它九月二十八日照会中所提出的建议，即召开外长会议，并在这个会上：
    一、英国、法国、美国、中华人民共和国和苏联的外交部长将审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施。
    二、英国、法国、美国和苏联的外交部长将讨论德国问题，包括在会议准备过程中提出来的一切建议。
    至于英国政府所提到的对奥和约问题，苏联政府认为必须指出，它在等候英国政府以及法国和美国政府对它在八月二十八日就这个问题提出的照会的答复，并声明：苏联政府所建议的通过普通的外交途径来讨论这个问题的办法还没有实行。
    苏联政府也以同样的照会送交法国政府和美国政府。
