    National Ethnic Sports Games Day Nine and Ten Situation
    The National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Games continued on the 9th. Although the weather was very cold, the stands around the venue were still full of spectators.

    On the 9th, the performance events were martial arts, folk sports, equestrian (light riding, obstacle), and the competition events were weightlifting, boxing, wrestling, and fencing.

    The martial arts performances included various boxing styles and single and paired routines with weapons such as staffs, spears, knives, and swords. Miao Yulong, an athlete from the Northwest region, performed Four Cannon Hammer and Eight Immortals Staff. Miao Yulong is seventy-five years old this year, but he is very energetic, with light and agile legs, looking like a young man. He is an athlete from Xining City, Qinghai Province, and has been practicing martial arts since he was twenty-five years old, for a full fifty years. He has never been sick and his health has always been very good. In the folk sports performance on the 9th, Bao Shanlin, a specially invited actor from the Beijing Capital Acrobatic Troupe, performed Zhongfan, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. Zhongfan is a bamboo pole that is three zhang high and weighs more than thirty jin. Bao Shanlin can dance it very lightly; he can lift the Zhongfan with his shoulders, the back of his hand, and his thumb, and can twist the Yangko while holding it on his head. On the 9th, although the wind made the Zhongfan weigh more than one hundred jin, he skillfully mastered the balance of the Zhongfan and somersaulted while holding it on his head.

    The riders from the Inner Mongolian grasslands gave wonderful light riding and obstacle performances at the conference. When they rode their steeds into the venue, the audience in the stands immediately burst into warm applause. In the light riding performance, five female athletes and six male athletes performed programs such as single person single horse, double person double horse, double person single horse, and multiple person multiple horse. They performed complex movements on horseback at high speed, such as balancing on one leg, handstands on horseback, and human pyramids. The obstacle riding was performed by seven Inner Mongolian athletes, who skillfully rode their horses through various obstacles and circles of fire, fully demonstrating the perseverance and bravery of the Inner Mongolian people.

    The folk sports performances on the 10th were diverse, including group Wu rope, elephant foot drum dance, stone lifting, leather whip, and "Bulu" throwing. The Wu rope performed by the railway team was created by fifteen stevedores from the Cangxian Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative of the Tianjin Railway Transportation Branch in combination with production. It is a sport that uses jump ropes to exercise. Two people swing the rope, and other athletes simultaneously cross the rope while doing various movements on the ground, demonstrating a high degree of cooperation. The audience in the stands repeatedly applauded their wonderful performance. These fifteen stevedores are all strong and have won four outstanding red flags in production competitions this year, over fulfilling the loading and unloading tasks. The elephant foot drum dance was performed by two young Dai people from the Southwest delegation. It is a popular folk sport among the Dai people in the Southwest region. The "Bulu" throwing performance by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a folk sport that reflects the lives of herdsmen. "Bulu" is a curved wooden device. When herdsmen encounter wild animals harming their flocks, they use "Bulu" to throw and protect the flocks, generally hitting seventy or eighty meters. They have been practicing throwing since they were young, so they not only throw far, but also accurately.

    On the wrestling stage, the Mongolian wrestling performance by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the North China region attracted the attention of the entire audience. Fourteen strong wrestlers, wearing brightly colored wrestling clothes, sang songs according to their customs, waving their hands and jumping, then sat down on both sides and began wrestling in pairs.

    During the archery competition on the 10th, the accuracy of the archery skills of Mongolian athletes Buhe Aoqier and Li Cheng won applause from the audience. Buhe Aoqier won two second-class archery medals at the First People's Sports Games of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Li Cheng won one first-class archery medal and one third-class archery medal.

    武术表演有各种拳术和棍、枪、刀、剑等器械单练和对打。西北区运动员苗玉龙表演了四炮锤和八仙棍。苗玉龙今年已七十五岁，但精神非常饱满，腿脚轻快利落，看起来如同青年人。他是青海省西宁市的运动员，从二十五岁起他就练习武术，到现在已经整整五十年，从来没有生过病，身体一直非常健康。在九日的民间体育表演中，特约的北京首都杂技团演员宝善林表演的中幡受到观众热烈欢迎。中幡是高三丈、重三十多斤的一根竹竿，宝善林可以把它很轻巧地舞起来；他能用肩、手背、大姆指把中幡顶起，并能顶在头上扭秧歌。九日虽然因为风大使中幡重量达到一百多斤，但他巧妙地掌握住中幡的平衡，并且顶着中幡翻筋斗。
