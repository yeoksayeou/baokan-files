Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th dispatch from TASS: More than 60,000 rural stores of the Soviet consumer cooperatives are striving to promote the sales of various goods to meet the material and cultural needs of collective farmers. In the first nine months of this year, their sales volume was three times that of the entire year of 1940. Since the beginning of this year, rural residents have purchased hundreds of thousands of radios, about one million bicycles, many cameras, sewing machines, and several thousand motorcycles and small cars from these stores. They have spent hundreds of millions of rubles on purchasing books, sports equipment, pictures, musical instruments, and furniture.

    The staff of rural stores are constantly improving their work. They frequently maintain contact with the masses to understand their needs. The Peskovo store in the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation is a good example. This store is equipped with a suggestion book and regularly records the names of the goods needed by customers, so that the consumer cooperative wholesale department can supply all popular and customer-required goods.

    This year, 3,000 new stores selling household goods and cultural goods have been opened in the Soviet countryside.

    苏联农村商店努力满足农民需要
    今年头九个月的销售量比一九四零年增加二倍
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联消费合作社的六万多个农村商店努力推销各种货品，以满足集体农民的物质和文化需要。在今年头九个月中，它们的销售量为一九四○年一年的三倍。自今年年初以来，农村居民从这些商店购买了几十万个收音机，约一百万辆脚踏车，许多照相机、缝纫机和几千辆机器脚踏车和小轿车。他们用于购买书籍、运动器具、图片、乐器和家具的钱有几亿卢布。
    农村商店的工作人员正在不断改进他们的工作。他们经常和群众保持接触以了解群众的需要。俄罗斯联邦沃罗涅兹州的佩斯科沃商店就是一个很好的例子。这个商店中备有一本意见簿，还经常记下顾客所需要的货名，这样就可使消费合作社批发处供应一切畅销的和顾客需要的货物。
    苏联的农村今年新开了三千个销售家庭用品和文化用品的商店。
