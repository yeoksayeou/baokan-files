    Tianjin Yongli Chemical Industry Company, Dagukou Factory
    Significant Production Development After Public-Private Partnership
    Daily Output of Soda Ash and Caustic Soda Sets Highest Record in Over Thirty Years Since Factory Establishment
    Since the private Tianjin Yongli Chemical Industry Company, Dagukou Factory, was reorganized into a public-private joint venture at the end of June last year, production has seen significant development. Currently, the average daily output of soda ash has increased by 55% compared to before the joint venture, and the average daily output of caustic soda has increased by 48% compared to before the joint venture, both of which have set the highest records since the factory was established over thirty years ago. The consumption quota for various raw materials has decreased by 13.34% compared to before the joint venture, greatly contributing to the reduction of costs.
    The reason why the factory's production has been able to achieve such rapid development is due to the change in production relations after the public-private joint venture, the economic reorganization, and its inclusion into the overall track of the national planned economy. In the past year or so, with the development of industries such as glass, printing and dyeing, papermaking, and soap, and the increase in the quantity of alkali used by the people, the production of soda ash and caustic soda in this factory has achieved unprecedented development.
    After the joint venture, the factory has preliminarily and systematically carried out a series of reforms. In terms of production reform, the past bloated and decentralized organization was adjusted according to the organizational structure of state-owned enterprises, making it unified and centralized for easy management. For example, the iron workshop, pattern shop, riveting factory, and foundry were merged into a mechanical branch factory. Unnecessary departments such as the examination office were abolished and replaced by functional departments such as the production technology section, planning section, and safety section, making production management more scientific. In terms of technological improvement, due to the workers' active search for tricks and tapping of production potential, there have been many creations and improvements in production over the past year. Workers in the soda machine group changed the oil cups that used to require manual oiling into automatic oil cups, extending the machine repair period and increasing the output of soda ash. In the fourth quarter of this year alone, it can increase production by 1.7 billion yuan for the country. In May of this year, the workers carried out a major overhaul of the factory's machinery and equipment, and installed more than 400 machine protection covers to prevent work-related injuries. In addition, each workshop summarized the operating methods of advanced workers into unified operating procedures. For example, in the caustic soda workshop, due to the unified operating methods, coal consumption was only 42% of that before the joint venture, and the consumption of soda ash required for manufacturing caustic soda was only 75% of that before the joint venture.
    In terms of democratic reform: the labor organization was adjusted, and the three-shift system in production was changed to a three-and-a-half-shift system, allowing workers to obtain reasonable rest time; more than 400 regular temporary workers were changed into long-term workers, and skilled workers were assigned to positions where they could exert their technical skills. At the same time, the past 295-level wage system was abolished and replaced by a scientific and reasonable eight-level wage system (from the fourth level to the eleventh level), which further encouraged workers' enthusiasm for active production and technological research.
    In addition, after the joint venture, more than 200 technicians were promoted to serve as squad leaders, foremen, and technicians, and a group of young and capable engineers were promoted to serve as deputy directors of workshops. These people can often lead by example in their work, driving workers to improve production and improve technology, and become the backbone of production.
    In the past year or so, the factory has also improved employee welfare measures. For example, the dining hall, which could originally only accommodate one or two hundred people, has been expanded to accommodate eight or nine hundred people, and nutrition canteens and health canteens have been set up to provide more nutritious food for employees who are overworked and in poor health; more than 70 dormitories for night shift workers have also been added.
    Due to the development of production and operation, shareholders received dividends this year, and private shareholders were extremely happy, and their confidence in operation was further enhanced. Many shareholders said, "This is something that has never happened in the thirty years since Yongli was established. Public-private joint ventures are really beneficial to the country, to the workers, and to the capitalists." Hou Yuchi, the former deputy director of the factory who is still the deputy director, said, "Production has increased after Yongli's joint venture. This demonstrates the superiority of public-private joint ventures and is beneficial to the factory and to the country."
    This year, the factory's funds for capital construction and various technical measures total more than 30 billion yuan. Currently, a survey of the entire factory has begun, preparing to continuously increase equipment and gradually transform this factory into a modern chemical factory.

    天津永利化学工业公司沽厂
    公私合营后生产有显著发展
    纯碱、烧碱日产量创建厂三十多年来的最高纪录
    私营天津永利化学工业公司沽厂从去年六月底改组为公私合营后，生产有了显著的发展。目前纯碱的平均日产量较合营前增加百分之五十五，烧碱的平均日产量较合营前增加百分之四十八，都创造了该厂建厂三十多年以来的最高纪录；各种原材料的消耗定额，较合营前降低了百分之十三点三四，大大有助于成本的降低。
    该厂生产所以能获得如此迅速的发展，是由于公私合营以后生产关系的改变，经济上的改组，纳入了国家计划经济的总轨道。一年多以来，随着玻璃、印染、造纸、肥皂等工业的发展和人民用碱数量的增加，该厂纯碱和烧碱的生产得到了空前的发展。
    该厂合营后初步有计划地进行了一系列的改革工作，在生产改革方面，将过去臃肿、分散的机构，按照国家企业的组织编制予以调整，使之统一集中，便于管理。如将铁工房、模样房、铆工厂及翻砂厂合并为机械分厂；取消了考工室等不必要的部门，代之以生产技术科、计划科、安全科等职能科室，使生产管理工作更科学化。在技术改进上，由于职工积极地寻找窍门，挖掘生产潜力，一年来在生产上有许多创造和改进。炭酸机小组工人把过去加油的油盅改成自动油盅，使修机期限延长，增加了纯碱产量，仅今年第四季度即可为国家增产十七亿数千万元。今年五月，职工们对全厂的机器设备进行了大检修，而且安装了机器保护套四百多个，防止了工伤事故的发生。此外，各车间将先进工人们的操作方法总结成为统一的操作规程，如烧碱车间由于统一了操作方法，煤耗仅为合营前的百分之四十二，制造烧碱时所需纯碱消耗只有合营前的百分之七十五。
    在民主改革方面：调整了劳动组织，将生产中的三班制改为三班半制，使工人获得了合理的休息时间；将四百多名定期临时工改成为长工，将有技术的工人都分配到能发挥其技术作用的岗位上去。同时，还废除了过去二百九十五级的工资制度，代之以科学合理的八级工资制（自第四级至第十一级），更鼓舞了工人积极生产，钻研技术的热情。
    此外，合营后，提拔了二百余名技术工人担任班长、工长和技术员，又提拔了一批年青有能力的工程师担任车间副主任，这些人在工作中多能以身作则，带动工人改进生产，提高技术，成为生产中的骨干力量。
    一年多来，该厂对职工福利措施也有改进。如将原来仅能容一、二百人的饭堂扩建成可容八、九百人，并设立了营养食堂和保健食堂，供给操作劳累和身体不好的职工以营养较丰富的食品；还添建了职工业余休养所以及七十余间夜班工人宿舍等。
    由于生产经营上的发展，今年股东们分得了股息，私股股东都极为高兴，经营信心更加提高。很多股东都说：“这是永利建厂三十多年以来没有过的事情。公私合营企业真是对国家、对工人、对资本家都有好处。”原任该厂副厂长现在仍担任副厂长的侯虞篪说：“永利合营后，生产提高了，这表现了公私合营企业的优越性，对工厂对国家都有好处。”
    该厂今年用于基本建设及各项技术措施的资金共达三百余亿元，目前已开始对全厂进行勘察，准备不断增加设备，逐步将这个工厂改造成为一座现代化的化学工厂。
