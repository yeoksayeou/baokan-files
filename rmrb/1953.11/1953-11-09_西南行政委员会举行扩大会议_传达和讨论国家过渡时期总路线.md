    Southwest Administrative Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting
    To Convey and Discuss the General Line of the State During the Transition Period
   [This newspaper dispatch] The Southwest Administrative Committee held an enlarged administrative meeting from October 31 to November 2 to convey and discuss the general line and general task of our country during the transition period. The meeting first listened to Vice Chairman Song Renqiong's report on the general line of our country during the transition period. Based on Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of recent central meetings, as well as the National Day slogans and the People's Daily National Day editorial this year, he focused on explaining three issues: 1. The general line of our country during the transition period; 2. The basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan under the general line; 3. On the issue of socialist transformation and state capitalism. Vice Chairman Lu Han reported on his participation in the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th meetings of the Central People's Government Committee, as well as his own feelings. He expressed his heartfelt support for the general line of our country during the transition period.
    After group discussions, the meeting held a general discussion on the 2nd. Xiong Kewu, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Huang Zhixuan, Jin Shi, Gao Xingya, Huang Liangchen, Fang Wansheng, Cao Diqiu and other nine people spoke successively, unanimously expressing their firm support for the general line and general task of our country during the transition period proposed by the central government, and their willingness to strive for its gradual realization. Xiong Kewu, Vice Chairman and representative of various democratic parties, said: The history of China in the past hundred years proves that if we want to build a strong, prosperous, and independent country, we must realize the country's socialist industrialization. The general line of our country during the transition period is completely correct and in line with the interests and aspirations of the broad masses of people. He continued: The democratic parties in the Southwest enthusiastically and sincerely respond to the call, firmly unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to realize the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, and educate the members of the democratic parties and the masses they are connected with to play an active role in this general task. Vice Chairman Liu Wenhui said: The nature of our country's current revolution determines that the future of the revolution is socialism, not capitalism. The general task of the country during the transition period is a lighthouse, illuminating the bright road for us to move forward. To complete this great and glorious historical task, we must continue to strengthen the people's democratic united front, strengthen ideological transformation, learn from the advanced Soviet science and technology experience, and practice increasing production and practicing economy. In his speech, Vice Chairman Deng Xihou expressed his hope that private industrialists and businessmen would gradually embark on the path of state capitalism and work hard to realize the long-term goal of the country's socialist industrialization. During the meeting, Huang Zhixuan, representative of the jointly owned Four-Zero-Five Coal Mine, and Jin Shi, manager of the Chongqing Branch of the jointly owned Minsheng Company, introduced that after their respective enterprises embarked on the path of state capitalism, they had a new look, and turned from past losses to profits. Shareholders are now able to receive dividends and bonuses. Cao Diqiu, Mayor of Chongqing, outlined the situation in Chongqing, where many private enterprises have undergone government processing, ordering, purchasing, sales, and the implementation of joint public-private ownership, and production has changed from decline to prosperity. He said that this situation powerfully illustrates the superiority of state capitalism. He pointed out that private industrialists and businessmen should actively participate in socialist transformation in the spirit of patriotism and law-abiding.
    In his concluding remarks, Vice Chairman Song Renqiong pointed out that it is arduous to complete the general line and general task of the country during the transition period. Therefore, we must not only see the favorable conditions, but also estimate the difficulties in the work process. Only in this way can we strengthen our confidence and determination. In the past few years, thanks to the unity of the democratic parties and people of all ethnic groups, great victories have been achieved in completing various social reform tasks, restoring and developing production, and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Now we are facing new historical tasks, and we must unite more closely to meet this task. He said: The general line of the transition period is the lighthouse illuminating all our work. Not only cadres in economic and financial work, but also cadres in all work positions must carry out their work around this general line; and strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience with a humble, persevering, hard-working spirit to overcome all difficulties in the work.

    西南行政委员会举行扩大会议
    传达和讨论国家过渡时期总路线
   【本报讯】西南行政委员会于十月三十一日到十一月二日举行行政会议扩大会，传达和讨论关于我国过渡时期的总路线、总任务。会议首先听取了宋任穷副主席关于我国过渡时期总路线的报告。他根据毛主席的指示和中央最近几次会议的精神，及今年国庆节口号和人民日报国庆节社论，着重解释了三个问题：一、我国过渡时期的总路线；二、在总路线下第一个五年计划的基本任务；三、关于社会主义改造和国家资本主义的问题。卢汉副主席报告了他参加中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会扩大会和中央人民政府委员会第二十四、二十五、二十六、二十七、二十八次会议的经过和自己的感想，他对我国过渡时期的总路线表示衷心的赞成和拥护。
    会议于分组讨论后，二日进行大会讨论：熊克武、刘文辉、邓锡侯、黄志煊、金石、高兴亚、黄凉尘、方皖生、曹荻秋等九人相继发言，一致表示坚决拥护中央提出的关于我国过渡时期的总路线、总任务，并愿为其逐步实现而奋斗。各民主党派代表熊克武副主席说：中国近百年来的历史证明，我们要建立一个富强、繁荣、独立的国家，必须实现国家社会主义工业化。我国过渡时期的总路线是完全正确的，符合广大人民的利益与愿望。他接着说：西南各民主党派热烈地忠诚地响应号召，坚定不移地团结在中国共产党周围，为实现国家过渡时期的总路线、总任务而奋斗，并教育各民主党派的成员和所联系的群众，在这一总任务中发挥积极的作用。刘文辉副主席说：我国目前革命的性质规定了革命的前途是社会主义而不是资本主义，国家过渡时期的总任务，正是一座灯塔，照着我们前进的光明大道；要完成这一伟大的光荣的历史任务，我们必须继续加强人民民主统一战线，加强思想改造，学习苏联先进科学技术经验，厉行增产节约。邓锡侯副主席在讲话中，希望私营工商业者逐步走上国家资本主义的轨道，为实现国家社会主义工业化的远大目标而努力。会中，公私合营四零五煤矿代表黄志煊，公私合营民生公司重庆分公司经理金石，介绍了各该企业走上国家资本主义道路以后，面目一新，由过去亏损转到有了盈余，股东们现在已能分到股息与红利的情况。重庆市人民政府曹荻秋市长概述了重庆市许多私营企业经过政府加工、订货、收购、包销和实行公私合营后，生产上都由衰蹶不振转向欣欣向荣的情景；他说，这种情况，有力地说明了国家资本主义的优越性；他指出私营工商业者应本着爱国守法的精神，积极参加社会主义改造。
    宋任穷副主席在最后讲话中指出：要完成国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务是艰巨的。因此我们既要看到有利条件，也要估计到工作进程中的困难。这样，才能坚定我们的信心和决心。过去几年来，由于各民主党派和各族人民的团结一致，已在完成各项社会改革工作，恢复与发展生产和抗美援朝斗争中取得了伟大胜利。现在又面临着新的历史任务，我们要更加团结一致来迎接这一任务。他说：过渡时期的总路线是照耀着我们各项工作的灯塔，不仅是财经工作干部，一切工作岗位的干部，都要围绕着这一总路线来进行工作；并以谦虚坚韧、苦学苦干的精神，加强对苏联先进经验的学习，战胜工作中的一切困难。（纪）
