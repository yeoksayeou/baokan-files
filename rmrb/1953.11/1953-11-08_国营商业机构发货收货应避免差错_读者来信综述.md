    State-owned Commercial Institutions Should Avoid Errors in Shipping and Receiving Goods
    —Summary of Readers' Letters

    As seen from recent letters to this newspaper from some readers, certain state-owned commercial institutions frequently make mistakes in their shipping and receiving work, which deserves attention.

    The errors in shipping work revealed by readers are roughly of the following two types:

    One type of phenomenon is: goods ordered by Location A or Company A are sent to Location B or Company B. According to letters from readers Cui Jingbo and Liu Bo: The Qinggang County Department Store in Heilongjiang Province ordered 6,000 jin of kerosene from the Anda County Coal Industry Construction Material Company in the same province at the end of March this year, but had not received the goods until early September this year. After repeated inquiries, the answer received was: "The goods have already been shipped!" Later, the Qinggang Department Store had to inquire everywhere to find out that the goods had been mistakenly sent to the Mingshui County Department Store in the same province. The Mingshui County Department Store did not order kerosene at all, and the Qinggang County Department Store suffered from a shortage of kerosene for a long time because of this.

    Another type of phenomenon is: the goods ordered are not the goods received. According to a letter from reader Guo Li: The Suiyuan Provincial Public Medical Care Management Committee purchased a deep X-ray therapy machine from the Tianjin General Company through the China Pharmaceutical Company Suiyuan Branch in December last year, but what was delivered was a Hungarian-style machine for irradiating metals such as copper and iron. They wrote to contact the company, but they ignored them. More than half a year has passed, and this machine, which is greatly needed in industry, is still in the hospital. Another example is reader Yu Jingqi's reflection that the East China Native Produce Company transferred jute to North China in November last year, which cost an extra 200 million yuan in transportation costs due to the wrong variety being shipped.

    The error in the receiving work is: the receiving unit cannot find the invoice after receiving the goods, resulting in long-term accumulation of goods. Reader Tian Di reflected: The Beijing Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company transferred 4,580 German bicycles from Guangzhou in November last year. The consignee received the goods but no one came to complete the purchase procedures, so they kept urging them. The comrades of the storage and transportation section of the wholesale station said: "The documents have not arrived yet." Let's urge the shipping unit, but they have forgotten where these cars were shipped from. Therefore, this batch of vehicles had to be placed in the warehouse. It was not until one day three months later that the comrades of the storage and transportation section discovered that the documents had actually arrived long ago, but were pressed in a drawer of a desk in the office. In that drawer, they also found documents for three or five other batches of goods that had been shipped long ago.

    Accelerating commodity circulation and reducing commodity circulation costs are among the important keys to the current state-owned commercial campaign to increase production and practice economy. The October 7th editorial of this newspaper, "Actively Carry out the State-owned Commercial Production Increase and Economy Practice Work" pointed out: "This is an important way to complete the profit delivery plan and accumulate funds for national construction." At present, some state-owned commercial institutions are not doing well enough in this area; and the direct losses caused by the above-mentioned errors undoubtedly make the speed of commodity circulation slower and the cost of commodity circulation higher, so it is urgent to improve. This requires the relevant units to improve the management system and strengthen the sense of responsibility in their work, in order to eliminate errors in receiving and sending goods, and make the well-organized goods smoothly supplied to consumers.

### 国营商业机构发货收货应避免差错——读者来信综述

    国营商业机构发货收货应避免差错
    ——读者来信综述
    从最近本报有些读者来信中看出，某些国营商业机构在发货、收货工作中时常发生差错，这是值得注意的。
    读者所揭露的发货工作中的差错大致有以下两类现象：
    一类现象是：甲地或甲家要的货，却发给了乙地或乙家。据读者崔景波、柳波来信反映：黑龙江青岗县百货公司在今年三月底向本省安达县煤业建筑器材公司订购了六千斤煤油，直到今年九月上旬还没收到货。几度催询，得到的答复都是：
  “货已经发去啦！”后来还是青岗百货公司自己到处打听，才知道货错发给本省明水县百货公司了。明水县百货公司根本没要煤油，而青岗县百货公司的煤油却因此脱销了很久。
    另一类现象是：要的是这货，收到的却是那货。据读者郭璃来信反映：绥远省公费医疗管理委员会在去年十二月通过中国医药公司绥远分公司向天津总公司购买了一架爱克斯光深部治疗机，结果运到的却是一部匈牙利式的照射铜、铁等金属的机器。写信去打交道，人家置之不理。到现在已经半年多了，这部工业上非常需要的机器还放在医院里。又如读者郁景琪反映，华东区土产公司去年十一月调往华北的大麻，因调错了品种而多化了运输费两亿元。
    在收货工作中的差错现象是：收货单位在收到货物后找不到票据，以致使货物长期积压。读者田地反映：中国百货公司北京市批发站在去年十一月间从广州调来了四千五百八十辆德国自行车。收货人收到货后总不见人来办理进货手续，就不断催促。批发站储运股的同志说：“单据还没到。”催发货单位吧，可是他们竟忘了这些车是从那里发来的。于是，这批车辆只好放在仓库里。直到三个月以后的一天，储运股同志才发现单据原来早就来了，只是压在办公室一张办公桌子的抽屉里了。在那个抽屉里，同时还发现了其他三、五笔早就运来了的货物的单据。
    加速商品流转和降低商品流转费用，是目前国营商业开展增产节约工作中的重要关键之一。十月七日本报社论“积极开展国营商业增产节约工作”中指出：“这是为完成利润上缴计划，为国家建设积累资金的重要途径。”目前某些国营商业机构在这一环节上做得还不够好；而上述差错所造成的直接损失，无疑地正是使商品流转速度更加迟缓、商品流转费用更加增加，因此亟需加以改进。这就需各有关单位健全经营制度，加强工作中的责任心，才能消灭收、发货物中的差错，并使组织好的商品顺畅地供应到消费者手里。
