Han cadres sent by Qinghai Province to pastoral areas such as Yushu, Chengdong, Nangqian, Guoluo, Tongde, Tongren, Qilian, Gonghe, Haiyan, Gangcha, Qumalai, Jianzha, and Xinghai successively launched crash courses in Tibetan last winter and this spring. The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to this study. At the beginning of the study, it pointed out the importance of learning Tibetan, explaining that working in minority areas without understanding the language of the minority nationality is equivalent to being blind and deaf. Only by being proficient in the language of the minority nationality can policies be directly conveyed to the minority people, understand the situation, establish feelings, and do a good job. This made the Han cadres sent to the area aware of the importance of learning Tibetan ideologically. At the same time, the Han cadres working in the pastoral areas also deeply experienced the difficulties of not understanding the language of the minority nationalities in their actual work, and realized that learning Tibetan is one of the powerful weapons for carrying out their work, so they all studied very seriously. The local party committees in the pastoral areas also actively led this study.

The crash courses lasted for up to three months and at least one month. After the study, many cadres can now speak ordinary Tibetan, and a few cadres can also recognize one or two thousand Tibetan characters. For example, the Guoluo Work Committee organized cadres to conduct a three-month crash course in Tibetan, learning 847 commonly used and policy-related sentences, and 80% of the cadres memorized more than 640 sentences. More than 370 people participated in the study in the Yushu area. After 85 days of study, they generally learned 601 Tibetan sentences and recognized more than 1,500 Tibetan characters. According to their level of proficiency, more than 40 people can now work directly without translation, more than 60 people can speak general Tibetan, and more than 90 people can receive Tibetan people in Tibetan. Among the 101 Han cadres in Tongde, 25 can act as interpreters, 50 can speak general Tibetan, and the remaining 26 can barely understand or partially understand the other party's meaning.

Han cadres learning Tibetan not only provides convenient conditions for their work, but also brings them closer to the minority people in terms of emotion. After the Han cadres of the Guoluo Work Committee learned Tibetan, the number of Tibetan people coming to the Work Committee increased day by day. After Wu Deqing, a medical cadre in Tongde, learned Tibetan, the Tibetan people said "This is our Menba (doctor)" when he treated them.

In order to consolidate and improve the existing achievements of Han cadres in pastoral areas in learning Tibetan, the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to strive to have 50% to 80% of the cadres able to speak directly with the Tibetan people without translation within one or two years, 10% of the people able to act as interpreters, and 5% of the people able to recognize more than 2,000 Tibetan characters. Based on the above tasks, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee put forward the following opinions:

First, the Party committees at all levels in the pastoral areas must lead cadres to establish a regular Tibetan language and writing learning system, formulate specific plans and requirements, conduct regular inspections and summaries, and emphasize that cadres should learn from the masses in their work. Among cadres with a basic knowledge of Tibetan, we should begin to organize the study of Tibetan writing.

Second, the existing Tibetan language teachers are all part-time. In some areas, Tibetan language learning has become unorganized because the teachers went to work in the countryside. In the future, the Party committees at all levels should make appropriate arrangements for the teachers' own business and teaching work, so as not to hinder the progress of learning.

Third, counties in pastoral areas can select models for learning Tibetan language and writing, and reward those with particularly excellent results, in order to encourage cadres to learn Tibetan language and writing.

After this period of studying Tibetan language and writing, the Han cadres in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province have gained the following preliminary experiences:

First, the Party committee attaches importance to it, the leaders take the lead, and the study is widely carried out from top to bottom, creating a mass learning upsurge. For example, before the Han cadres of the Yushu Autonomous Region-level organs learned Tibetan, some cadres had the wrong idea that "learning Tibetan is not very useful for their work." Therefore, the progress of learning was uneven, and little progress was seen. When Chengdong County learned Tibetan last year, many people also held a perfunctory attitude of "only reciting the words, not remembering the meaning of the words." After the leadership criticized this wrong thinking, the learning situation changed greatly. Ji Chunguang, secretary of the Yushu Prefectural Committee, Ma Wanli, secretary of the Guoluo Work Committee, Wang Yuying, minister of the Propaganda Department, and other responsible cadres not only organized and led cadres to study, but also personally participated in the study, attending classes and discussions with cadres, which greatly encouraged cadres' enthusiasm for learning. Now they can all speak ordinary Tibetan. Ji Chunguang has also learned more than 2,000 Tibetan words.

Second, in order to solve the difficulty of learning Tibetan language and writing in a short period of time and lay the foundation for future self-study, it is necessary to carry out the study by means of a crash course. During the crash course, it is necessary to learn and use at the same time, so as to consolidate what has been learned. After laying the foundation for self-study, pay attention to regular study.

Third, it is necessary to establish a strict learning leadership organization and a regular learning system. When the Guoluo Work Committee conducted a crash course in Tibetan, it designated a special person to be responsible for supervising and inspecting and organizing the learning work, and organized a Tibetan teaching group, which was divided into teaching, textbook preparation, and phonetic notation groups to be responsible for learning matters. The teaching group established a system of in-class tests, end-of-month tests, and criticism and rewards based on different learning situations, which played a major role in ensuring the completion of the learning tasks.

Fourth, compile textbooks well. When compiling textbooks, it is necessary to proceed from the actual situation in the pastoral areas and prevent the use of customs and habits of Han areas to formulate textbooks. The language used in textbooks should be classified according to different vocabularies and combined with reality, starting with daily language and then policy language.

Fifth, in addition to the timely inspection, testing, and summary by the leadership, individuals should study hard and speak more, and not be afraid of being shy. When the cadres of the Guoluo Work Committee and Tongren County learned Tibetan, they paid attention to learning from people who understood Tibetan and Chinese languages, and asked them about the names of general things at any time, learned short conversations, paid attention to their pronunciation, and practiced along with them. After the pronunciation was correct, they wrote it down in Chinese or phonetic symbols, and read the recorded information again to them to see if it was correct, and corrected any errors immediately. After learning ordinary Tibetan, they learned to use it in daily life, and were not afraid of others laughing at them for not speaking well. Learning anytime and anywhere and correcting mistakes in time enabled them to achieve success in learning Tibetan.

### 青海牧业区许多汉族干部学会了藏话  更加密切了和当地人民群众的关系

    青海牧业区许多汉族干部学会了藏话
    更加密切了和当地人民群众的关系
    青海省派往牧区玉树、称多、囊谦、果洛、同德、同仁、祁连、共和、海晏、冈察、曲麻莱、尖扎、兴海等地的汉族干部，在去冬今春先后展开了藏语的突击学习。中共青海省委非常重视这次学习，在学习开始时，就指出学习藏语的重要，说明在少数民族地区工作，不懂少数民族的语文就等于盲哑人，只有通晓了少数民族语文，才能直接向少数民族人民传达政策，了解情况，建立感情，做好工作；使派去的汉族干部对学习藏语的重要性，在思想上有了认识。同时，牧业区工作的汉族干部在实际工作中也深刻体验到不懂少数民族语文的困难，体会到学习藏语是开展工作的有力武器之一，所以学习都很认真。牧业区各地党委也积极领导了这次学习。
    突击学习时间，多者历时三个月，少者一个月。经过学习后，现在有许多干部已能说普通藏话，少数干部还认会了一、二千个藏文单字。如果洛工委组织干部进行了三个月的藏语突击学习，学了一般用语和政策用语八百四十七句，有百分之八十的干部记住了六百四十多句。玉树地区参加学习的有三百七十多人，经过八十五天的学习，一般都已学会了六百零一句藏语，并认会了一千五百多个藏文单字；按程度来分，现在不用翻译，可直接进行工作的已有四十多人，能说一般藏话的有六十多人，能用藏话接待藏民的有九十多人。同德一百零一个汉族干部中，有二十五人能当翻译，能说一般藏话的有五十人，其余二十六人能勉强听懂或部分听懂对方语意。
    汉族干部学会了藏话，不但在工作上有了便利的条件，而且在感情上也和少数民族人民群众更加密切了。果洛工作委员会的汉族干部学会藏语后，到工作委员会来往的藏民日益增多。同德医务干部吴德卿学会了藏语，给藏民治病时，藏民都说“这是我们的门巴（医生）”。
    中共青海省委宣传部为了巩固与提高牧业区汉族干部学习藏语的既得成绩，提出争取在一二年内有百分之五十到百分之八十的干部能不用翻译，直接和藏族人民说话，百分之十的人能当翻译，百分之五的人能认会两千个以上藏文单字的要求。根据上述任务，省委宣传部并提出下列意见：
    一、牧业区各级党委必须领导干部建立经常性的藏语藏文的学习制度，订出具体计划和要求，经常检查总结，并强调干部在工作中向群众学习。在有了藏语基础的干部中，要开始组织学习藏文。
    二、现有的藏语教员都是兼职，有些地区曾因教员下乡工作，藏语学习发生自流现象。今后各级党委应该对藏语教员的本身业务和教学工作作适当安排，以免妨碍学习进度。
    三、牧业区各县可评选藏语藏文学习模范，奖励成绩特别优良的，借以鼓舞干部学习藏语藏文的情绪。
    青海省牧业区的汉族干部经过这一个时期的藏族语文的学习，获得了以下几点初步经验：
    第一、党委重视，首长带头，从上到下普遍展开学习，造成群众性的学习热潮。如玉树自治区一级机关汉族干部学习藏语前，有些干部的思想上存在“学习藏语对自己业务用处不大”等错误思想，因此，学习进度参差不齐，看不出多少成绩。称多县在去年学习藏语时同样有很多人抱着敷衍塞责的态度，“只念口歌，不记字义”。领导上对这种错误思想作了批判后，学习情况有了很大改变。玉树地委书记冀春光，果洛工作委员会书记马万里、宣传部长王育英等负责干部，不但组织和领导干部学习，而且亲自参加学习，同干部一起上课和讨论，大大地鼓舞了干部学习的情绪。现在他们都能说普通藏话。冀春光还学会了二千多个藏文生字。
    第二、要在短时间内解决学习藏族语文的困难，给以后自学打下基础，就必须用突击的方法进行学习。在突击学习时必须边学边用，这样才能把学会了的巩固下来。在打下自学基础后要注意经常性学习。
    第三、要建立严密的学习领导组织和经常的学习制度。果洛工作委员会在突击学习藏语时，曾指定专人负责督促检查和组织学习的工作，并组织了藏语教学组，分为教学、教材编写和注音三个小组负责学习事宜。教学组根据不同的学习情况，建立了随堂测验、月终测验和批评与奖励制度，这对保证学习任务的完成起了重大作用。
    第四、编好教材。在编写教材时，要从牧业区实际情况出发，防止以汉族地区的风俗习惯拟定教材。教材用语要根据不同词汇，结合实际，进行分类，先由日常用语再到政策用语。
    第五、除了领导上及时检查、测验、总结外，在个人方面要勤学多说，不要怕羞。如果洛工作委员会及同仁县的干部在学习藏语中，注意向懂得藏汉语文的人学习，随时问他们一般东西的名称，学习简短的会话，注意听他们的发音，并跟着他们练习。读音正确后，用汉文或注音符号记起来，把记下的再念一遍给他们听，看是否对，有错的地方即时改正。当学会普通藏话后，便在日常生活中学习着用，不怕说的不好别人笑。这样随时随地学习，及时纠正错误，就使藏语学习获得了成绩。
