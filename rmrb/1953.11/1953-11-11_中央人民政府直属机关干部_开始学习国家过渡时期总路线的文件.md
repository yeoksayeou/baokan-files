Cadres of Directly Subordinate Organs of the Central People's Government
Begin Studying Documents on the General Line for the Transition Period
    Cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government have begun studying the general line and general task for our country during the transition period, based on their preliminary study of Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)".
    Forty-three units of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government successively concluded their study of Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" by the end of October. The vast majority of units discussed the two issues of "the necessity of the transition period from capitalism to socialism" and "the essence and content of the New Economic Policy." On this basis, the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Central People's Government convened a conference on October 28 to mobilize and arrange the study of the general line and general task for our country during the transition period. High-, middle-, and low-level cadres participated in this study. The study period is scheduled for two months.
    In order to achieve good results in this study, the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs requires everyone to carefully read the prescribed documents, and the responsible comrades of each organ should convey the issues related to the general line and general task of the state during the transition period to all staff members of their respective units. When studying the general line, everyone should be encouraged to connect it with their own thoughts and work in order to deepen their understanding of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and to work hard to implement the state's general line and general task.

    开始学习国家过渡时期总路线的文件
    中央人民政府直属机关干部在初步学完“联共（布）党史”第九章的基础上，开始了关于我国在过渡时期总路线和总任务的学习。
    中央人民政府直属机关四十三个单位，已于十月底先后结束了“联共（布）党史”第九章的学习。绝大多数单位都讨论了“从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的必要性”和“新经济政策的实质与内容”两个问题。在这一基础上，中共中央人民政府直属机关委员会于十月二十八日召开了大会，动员和布置关于我国过渡时期总路线、总任务的学习。参加这次学习的有高、中、初级的干部。学习时间规定为二个月。
    为了使这次学习收到良好的效果，直属机关党委要求大家精读规定的文件，并由各机关的负责同志向本单位的全体工作人员传达有关国家过渡时期总路线、总任务的问题。在学习总路线时，启发大家联系自己的思想和工作，以加深对国家过渡时期总路线、总任务的认识，并为贯彻国家的总路线、总任务而努力工作。
