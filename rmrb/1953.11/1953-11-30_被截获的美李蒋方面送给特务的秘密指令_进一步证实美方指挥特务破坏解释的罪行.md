Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th: Secret instructions from the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang sides to special agents in Tongchang-ri, intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces, fully confirm the numerous facts constantly revealed by our returning personnel: the U.S. side and the Rhee-Chiang special agents in the POW camps maintained close contact, directed the forcible detention of prisoners of war, and sabotaged the explanation work.

These secret instructions further confirm that the U.S. side and the special agents in the camps had frequent contact and communication. Returning personnel have long revealed that, in addition to secretly sending people to Seoul to transmit information, special agents sent messages to Wen Chonghao, the head of the special agents in Camp 49, almost every day. The Rhee Syngman driver who drove the garbage truck also served the task of transmitting messages. The Kuomintang News Agency repeatedly obtained so-called "petitions" from Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in the camps through so-called "secret messengers." Choi Mun-deok, a North Korean People's Army prisoner of war who escaped from Camp 48, personally witnessed on October 17 a Rhee Syngman driver giving a package to Jiang Jinglie, the head of the special agents. Jiang Jinglie also instructed the driver to bring some batteries for the receiver next time.

The secret instructions definitively confirm that the U.S. side used radio stations to direct the special agents in the camps and used code words to communicate. The secret instructions ordered Han Yin Song, the special agent head of the "First Deputy Head" of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," a Rhee Syngman special agent organization in Dongchang-ri, "to inform the code received by radio" to the special agent head of another camp area, the "Second Deputy Head," and said:

"The code now used for the commander should be sent after the morning news and after the evening news on November 9." According to information from our returned prisoners of war: the Rhee-Chiang special agents in Camps 9, 20, 25, 35, 40, 48, 49, 51, and 53 in Dongchang-ri all had radio communication equipment. The U.S. side continued to smuggle them in. The Indian troops intercepted a radio receiver smuggled into the POW camp by the U.S. side on November 7. Returning personnel Zhang Xinglong also knew for sure that on November 6, a radio receiver was hidden in a can of milk powder supplied by the U.S. side and sent to Camp 20. It was through these radio equipment that the special agents in the camps constantly received various instructions from the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang sides to sabotage the explanation work and detain prisoners of war.

The secret instructions also once again confirm that the U.S. 64th Field Hospital served as the liaison and command center for special agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. The instructions said:

"Future communications will use broadcasts and be sent by Jin Cheng-lu in the hospital to the first and second deputy heads." Returning personnel Zhao Nanxi and others revealed that Jin Cheng-lu and Shen Changhao, a Rhee Syngman special agent in the U.S. "administrative staff," had secret contacts, and Shen Changhao frequently traveled between Seoul and Dongchang-ri. The Kuomintang special agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp were directed by another U.S. "administrative staff" member in the hospital, a Taiwanese special agent known as "Teacher Ma." Ge Yunfei, a special agent originally in Camp 31, was transferred to the hospital "kitchen" to specifically serve as a liaison for the various camps. Returning personnel Qian Shunkun had intercepted five secret instructions issued by "Teacher Ma" and Ge Yunfei to the heads of special agents in various camps and handed them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The secret instructions also showed that the special agents had turned the "POW Representative Conference" convened by the custodial forces into a place for them to discuss sabotaging the explanation work. The secret instructions ordered the special agents to "pass this order at the representatives' meetings of each camp as soon as possible before carrying out...demonstrations against the explanation." Returning personnel Zhang Xinglong said that Lu Youming, the "battalion commander" of Camp 20, conveyed the message after the "POW Representatives' Meeting" on November 7: "Unless the Indians agree to only one review (referring to explanation), and everyone must return if the review is not completed, we will not leave the camp." Li Mingde, a special agent in Camp 11, even openly said: "What kind of representative meeting is that! We are just using it to do our own things."

The secret instructions also confirmed that special agents used semaphore and other signals to contact the outside of the camp. Camp 40, where Chi Jizhe, one of the recipients of the secret instructions, was located, was only a few hundred meters away from Hill 155 in the U.S.-controlled area. The content of the instructions further proved the fact revealed by Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, as early as October 6. At that time, he pointed out at a press conference that one of the ways special agents received instructions from the outside world was through signals sent from the mountains in the U.S.-controlled area near the Dongchang-ri POW camp.

### 被截获的美李蒋方面送给特务的秘密指令  进一步证实美方指挥特务破坏解释的罪行

    被截获的美李蒋方面送给特务的秘密指令
    进一步证实美方指挥特务破坏解释的罪行
   【新华社开城二十八日电】印度看管部队截获的美李蒋方面给东场里特务的秘密指令，完全证实了我方归来人员所不断揭露的美方和战俘营中李蒋特务保持密切联系，指挥强迫扣留战俘和破坏解释工作的大量事实。
    这个秘密指令进一步证实了美方和营场内的特务有经常的来往联络。归来人员早已揭露，特务除了偷偷派人到汉城传递信息以外，几乎每天都有人到四十九号营场特务头子文重浩处传送消息，驾驶垃圾车的李承晚司机也担任传递消息的任务。国民党通讯社曾屡次通过所谓“秘密信使”得到营场内蒋匪特务的“请愿书”之类。自第四十八号营场逃出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔文德在十月十七日还亲眼看见一个李承晚司机给了特务头目姜京烈一包东西，姜京烈并且嘱咐那个司机下次带些收报机用的电池来。
    秘密指令确定地证实了美方用电台指挥营场内的特务及使用密码联络的方法。秘密指令命令在东场里的李承晚特务组织“反共青年团”“第一副团长”特务头目韩银松“将以收音机收报的密码告知”统治另一个营区的特务头子“第二副团长”，并说：
  “现在使用发给团长的密码于十一月九日早晨新闻时间后和晚上新闻时间之后发出。”据已经归来的我方被俘人员所悉：在东场里第九、二十、二十五、三十五、四十、四十八、四十九、五十一、五十三各号营场的李蒋特务都有无线电通讯设备。而美方还在不断地偷运进去，印度部队在十一月七日截获过一个美方偷运进战俘营的无线电收报机，归来人员张兴隆也确切地知道在十一月六日有一架无线电收报机藏在美方供给的奶粉罐头里送进了第二十号营场。正是通过这些无线电设备，营场中的特务不断收到美李蒋方面破坏解释工作和扣留战俘的各项指示。
    秘密指令也再一次证实美方以六十四野战医院作为东场里战俘营特务联络指挥中心。指令说：
  “以后的联络将利用广播和在病院的金成禄发到第一、第二副团长处。”归来人员赵南锡等揭露：金成禄和美方“行政人员”李承晚特务申昌浩有着秘密联系，而申昌浩则经常来往于汉城与东场里之间。东场里战俘营中的国民党特务由医院中的另一美方“行政人员”、台湾特务“马老师”指挥，原在第三十一号营场的特务葛云飞则被调至医院“伙房”专门担任联络各营场的工作。归来人员钱顺坤曾截获五份由“马老师”、葛云飞发给各营区特务头子的秘密指令，并且把他们交给了中立国遣返委员会。
    秘密指令也表明特务已把看管部队召集的“战俘代表会”变为他们商量破坏解释工作的场所。秘密指令命令特务“在进行……反对解释示威之前，请尽速在各营场代表会议上通过此项命令”。归来人员张兴隆说，二十号营场“大队长”特务吕有明在十一月七日开完“战俘代表会”后回来传达：“除非印度人答应只受一次审查（按指解释），审查不完要全体回来，否则我们就不出营场”。第十一号营场的特务李明德甚至公开说：“那里是什么代表会议！我们利用它办自己的事罢了。”
    秘密指令也证实了特务用旗语等信号与营场外联络。秘密指令受件人之一池基哲所在的第四十号营场即与美方控制区的一五五高地相距仅数百公尺。指令内容进一步证明了中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将早在十月六日所揭露的事实，当时他在记者招待会上指出特务得到外界指示的途径之一，就是从东场里战俘营附近美方控制区的山头发出的信号。
