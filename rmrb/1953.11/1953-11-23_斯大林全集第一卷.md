    Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 1
    Lu Dingyi

    The Chinese translation of the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works has been published. This is an important event for the Chinese Communist Party, for the Chinese people, and for our country's Marxist-Leninist propaganda and scientific work.

    Marxist-Leninist doctrine was spread in China after the great October Socialist Revolution. Under the guidance of this doctrine, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to complete the democratic revolution and establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The basic task of the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is, over a considerable period, to steadily and gradually build and transform China, which is economically backward and where capitalist, small-commodity, and socialist economies coexist, into an industrialized, socialist, prosperous, and powerful country. The higher the Chinese Communist Party's Marxist-Leninist theoretical level and the better the Marxist-Leninist propaganda work done among the people, the more fully guaranteed we will be to complete the great historical task placed before us.

    For more than thirty years after the October Revolution, Chinese communists and progressive intellectuals translated many works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. But only after the people gained power did we have the opportunity to begin translating all the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin into Chinese and introducing them to China. The Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee is now doing this extremely meaningful work. Their plan is to publish the complete works of Lenin and Stalin successively, and then the complete works of Marx and Engels. The publication of the Chinese translation of the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works is the first time their work results have met the public.

    The first volume of Stalin's Collected Works contains the author's works in the early period of his activities. These are Stalin's works during the period of the founding of the Soviet Communist Party and the Russian Revolution of 1905. Leninism, the ideological system and policy of "Marxism in the era of imperialism," was formed and developed during this period. In his early activities, Stalin supported Lenin, assisted Lenin, and fought against the enemies of Leninism.

    Stalin's essay "Anarchism or Socialism?", published in 1906-1907, is one of the most important works in the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works. This work is a correct and popular explanation of dialectical method, materialism, and proletarian socialism.

    The two sections on dialectical method and materialism in this work were later more fully developed in Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism." If the two are compared, it can be seen that some of the main points of the latter already had a brief and popular explanation in "Anarchism or Socialism?".

    "Anarchism or Socialism?" is not only a popular explanation of Marxist philosophy; in this essay, Stalin also enriched the Marxist dialectical method with new principles. In this work, Stalin pointed out that development is the struggle between the new and the old, and that the new is invincible in the struggle with the old. Stalin said: "That which arises newly in life and grows day by day is invincible; it is impossible to stop its progress. That is to say, for example, the proletariat, since it has arisen in life as a class and grows day by day, will ultimately be victorious no matter how weak and small it may be today. Why? Because it is growing, expanding, and advancing. Conversely, that which is aging in life and heading for the grave is bound to fail, even if it seems a strong force today. That is to say, for example, the bourgeoisie, since it is gradually losing its foothold and increasingly regressing, is bound to fail no matter how strong and large it may be today. Why? Because it as a class has decayed, weakened, aged, and become a burden in life." (Page 275) As everyone knows, this principle is stated more precisely in "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" and constitutes an important part of the latest development of dialectical theory.

    In the third part of this work, except for the point that "one of the main conditions for the victory of the socialist revolution is that the proletariat constitutes the majority of the population," as stated in the author's preface, is "one of the somewhat outdated views of the older generation of Marxists," which must be replaced by Lenin's theory of socialist revolution, which arose between 1915 and 1916, namely, "the socialist revolution does not necessarily win in the most developed capitalist countries, but will first win in countries where the capitalist front is weak, where the proletariat can break through this front relatively easily, and where capitalism has only a medium level of development," Stalin explained the most basic issues in the proletarian revolutionary struggle, such as capitalist society, socialist society, class struggle, socialist revolution and proletarian dictatorship, workers' organizations and working-class parties, with clear logic and profoundness. Stalin's explanations still retain full power and are still the best reading material on the basic concepts of proletarian socialism. As our country is transitioning to socialism, studying Stalin's work, understanding that capitalism is a dead end and socialism is the bright road, and understanding that the proletariat and the working people must fight for socialism, is of great significance for understanding and implementing the current general line of the Party.

    All the works in the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works are permeated with the idea of the leadership of the working class in the revolution. Stalin's works systematically tell us that the ideological system and policy of Leninism were formed and developed precisely on the viewpoint of the working class's leadership in the revolution.

    What is the ultimate goal of the revolution? On whom should revolutionaries place their hopes? This question had already been resolved in Lenin's and Plekhanov's struggle against the Populists. Stalin, in his own works, supported Lenin's views with great clarity and enthusiasm and gave a fatal blow to the various bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, economist, nationalist, and anarchist factions active in the South Caucasus at that time. Stalin wrote: "Only the revolutionary proletariat has the historical mission of liberating mankind and seeking happiness for the whole world." (Page 6) "We see that the only class that is constantly growing and becoming stronger, forever advancing and fighting for the future, is the urban and rural proletariat. Therefore, we should serve the proletariat and place our hopes on it." How to serve the proletariat? Stalin said: "Our main task is to promote the elimination of capitalist ownership and the establishment of socialist ownership." (Pages 302-303)

    What is the current goal of the revolution? At that time, the nature of the Russian revolution was not yet a socialist revolution, but a democratic revolution, that is, a revolution to overthrow the Tsarist autocratic system. In this revolution, should the working class participate and gain leadership? Forty or fifty years ago, the Russian Communists and opportunists waged a fierce struggle over this issue. In "The Russian Social-Democracy and its Immediate Tasks," written in October 1901, Stalin advocated that the working class should lead the democratic revolution. He said at that time: "How narrow-minded is the view of some 'Social Democrats,' who want to limit the workers' movement to the scope of economic struggle and various economic organizations, leaving the political struggle to the 'intellectuals,' college students, and social figures, while only letting the workers play a supporting role. History teaches us that under such circumstances, the workers will only have to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the bourgeoisie." Stalin analyzed the characteristics of the bourgeoisie, namely (1) in the struggle against autocracy, the bourgeoisie often likes to use the strength of the workers, but when victory has been achieved, they seize the fruits of victory for themselves, leaving the workers with nothing; (2) the bourgeoisie is constantly afraid of the "red specter" of communism, so as long as they get a little concession from the Tsarist government that is beneficial to themselves, they will shamelessly betray the cause of freedom. Therefore, "only the working class is the truly democratic and reliable pillar." "In order to play a leading role, the working class must be organized into an independent party." (Pages 23-24)

    This is the idea of Leninism. This is completely contrary to the opportunism of the time. The opportunists at that time were the "Economists" and the Mensheviks (i.e., the "Minority"). The "Economists" were followers of Bernstein, and they simply believed that as long as they engaged in economic struggle, without any revolutionary struggle, they could realize socialism, and even declared that the struggle to overthrow the autocratic system was completely superfluous, and that political freedom was compatible with the Tsarist system. This is a complete cancellation of the revolution. The Mensheviks advocated that the democratic revolution should be led by the bourgeoisie, and that the working class should not strive for leadership in the democratic revolution. This is also a cancellation of the revolution. As everyone knows, in the process of struggling with these opportunists, Lenin wrote "What Is to Be Done?", "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," and "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," laying the ideological, organizational, and tactical foundations for the Soviet Communist Party. Stalin firmly supported Lenin in this struggle and fought against opportunism.

    The root of opportunism lies primarily in worshiping the spontaneity of the workers' movement and reducing the role of socialist consciousness in the workers' movement. The Russian "Economists" are specimens of this opportunism. They believe that the workers' movement does not need the leadership of a Marxist party, and that the workers' movement will spontaneously produce a socialist ideology; "movement is everything, while consciousness is insignificant." They advocate the so-called "pure workers' movement," "opposing any intellectuals who are not of worker origin (even socialist intellectuals)." (Lenin's Selected Works, two-volume edition, Volume 1, Moscow edition, page 208) They are obsessed with economic struggle, saying that "economic struggle must be given a political character" (i.e., explaining economic struggle as political struggle, i.e., reducing political struggle to economic reform), but "they are unable to explain to the working masses that the ultimate goal of the movement is socialism, or even to explain to the working masses that the current goal is to overthrow the autocratic system, and even more sadly, they believe that all this is not only useless, but also harmful." (Page 14)

    Lenin refuted the "Economists" in detail in "What Is to Be Done?". Lenin's famous saying is: "Without a revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement."

    Stalin supported Lenin's proposition in "A Brief Account of the Differences of Opinion in the Party." In this article, Stalin summarized the main points of "What Is to Be Done?", and then said:

    "What is scientific socialism without the workers' movement? -- It is like a compass placed on a ship that is not used, it will only rust, and in the end it will have to be thrown into the sea.

    "What is the workers' movement without socialism? -- It is like a big ship without a compass, although it can also sail to the other shore, but with a compass, it will reach the other shore much faster and with less danger.

    "Combining these two things together will make a very good big ship, which will sail all the way to the other shore and safely approach the dock.

    "Combining the workers' movement and socialism will result in a social-democratic movement, which will move forward vigorously and reach the 'land of happiness.'

    "Therefore, the responsibility of the Social Democrats (and not just the intellectuals of the Social Democrats) is to combine socialism and the workers' movement, to instill socialist consciousness into the workers' movement, thereby giving the spontaneous workers' movement a social-democratic character." (Page 91)

    Stalin argued that: "The spontaneous movement is the workers' movement without socialism, 'is trade unionism' (Lenin: "What Is to Be Done?"), and trade unionism is unwilling to see anything outside the scope of capitalism." (Page 85)

    Stalin argued that: The workers' movement spontaneously tends towards socialism, but the proletariat in the position of being exploited and enslaved cannot create a socialist ideology by itself. The creators of scientific socialism are the representatives of science, individual members of the bourgeois intellectual class, that is, communist intellectuals, such as Marx and Engels. Therefore, socialist consciousness can only be instilled into the workers' movement from the outside.

    Stalin's "Reply to 'Social Democrat'" (page 143) and note 46 (page 370) are very important. Stalin's work was enthusiastically welcomed by the Bolshevik Central Committee, which was residing abroad at that time. Lenin also introduced it in "The Proletarian," considering it "an excellent formulation of the famous question of 'instilling consciousness from the outside.'"

    The Russian Communists, while struggling with the Populists, decided in the 1890s (approximately from 1894 to 1901) to work exclusively among the workers and severely criticized all attempts to leave this work, which was "very natural and legitimate," because "at that time the entire task was to consolidate itself among the working class." (Lenin's Selected Works, Volume 1, page 253) In 1901, due to the industrial crisis in Europe, political strikes broke out among Russian workers, and the number of Marxists also increased. At this time, it was absolutely necessary to organize a Marxist party to lead the political struggle of workers and people of all strata. The struggle against the "Economists" deepened the understanding of the necessity of a Marxist party, thereby laying the ideological foundation of the Party.

    However, the problem of establishing a Marxist party was again hindered by the Mensheviks ("Minority"). Lenin wrote "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" to refute the Mensheviks. This work laid the organizational foundation for the Marxist party. Stalin's "The Proletariat and the Proletarian Party" supported Lenin's propositions and opposed the Mensheviks.

    Stalin said: "The proletarian party, as a fighting leading group, first, in terms of the number of members, it should be much smaller than the proletariat; second, in terms of the degree of consciousness and experience, it should be higher than the proletariat; third, it should be a united organization." (Page 56)

    The Mensheviks advocated that the Party should be a collection of individuals. They believed that to be a party member, only two conditions were enough, namely, recognizing the Party program and assisting the Party regularly. The Bolsheviks advocated that the Party should be a centralized organization, and that party members should have three conditions, namely, recognizing the Party program, providing material assistance to the Party, and participating in one of the Party's organizations. Stalin explained the importance of this third condition, saying: "To be a party member, one must implement the Party's program, tactics, and organizational views; to implement the Party's views, one must fight for these views; to fight for these views, one must work in the Party's organization and work with the Party. Obviously, to be a party member, one must participate in one of the Party's organizations. Only when we participate in one of the Party's organizations, thereby integrating our personal interests with the interests of the Party, can we become party members." (Pages 58-59) Stalin pointed out that the kind of party advocated by the Mensheviks was an "unorganized organization," a "banquet," not a centralized organization, not an organization of leaders.

    The Mensheviks did not want a Marxist centralized party organization because they originally did not want a revolution. This was fully exposed in the debate on tactical issues. In 1905, when workers were conducting armed struggles in many cities, the Mensheviks opposed the working class leading the democratic revolution and opposed organizing an armed uprising. The Mensheviks clung to the history of the French bourgeois revolution, believing that the leadership of the bourgeois democratic revolution could only belong to the bourgeoisie; whatever happened in France must also happen in Russia, and it was fundamentally impossible to realize in Russia what Europe had not yet realized. They did not see and did not want to see the fact that in the French Revolution it was the bourgeoisie who led the revolution, while in Russia at that time, because capitalism had developed to the stage of imperialism, because the proletariat had a higher level of consciousness, and because a Marxist party already existed, although the nature of the revolution was still a bourgeois democratic revolution, the one who could lead this revolution to complete realization was no longer the bourgeoisie, but the proletariat.

    Lenin wrote "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," proposing "a new policy on tactical questions for the Marxist party in the bourgeois democratic revolution, which was fundamentally different from the tactical policies that had previously existed in the Marxist arsenal," (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), page 114, September 1949 Liberation Press edition), that is, the policy of the proletariat becoming the leader and leader of the bourgeois revolution, that is, the policy of expelling the bourgeoisie from the leadership stage and forming a worker-peasant alliance. In this work, Lenin proposed a new theory of socialist revolution, that is, under the leadership of the proletariat, completing the democratic revolution and immediately beginning the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. Stalin said: "This is a new theory of socialist revolution, affirming that the socialist revolution will not be realized by the proletariat alone and helpless against the entire bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat as the leader, possessing the semi-proletarian masses, that is, millions of 'exploited laboring masses' as allies. "According to this theory, the leadership of the proletariat in the bourgeois revolution realized under the alliance of the proletariat and the peasants should be transformed into the leadership of the proletariat in the socialist revolution realized under the alliance of the proletariat and the rest of the exploited laboring masses; and the democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants should prepare the foundation for the proletarian socialist dictatorship." (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), page 122, September 1949 Liberation Press edition)

    Two lines, two strategies, were expressed at that time in two resolutions. The Bolshevik line, represented by the "Resolution of the Third Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party," advocated that the Party should organize the people's armed uprising and participate in the provisional revolutionary government, which would become the organ of the people's victorious uprising. The Menshevik line, represented by the "Resolution of the Representative Conference," advocated that "the Social Democrats should not be determined to seize power or share power in the provisional government," that is, opposed organizing the people's armed uprising to overthrow the Tsarist autocratic government, and opposed participating in the provisional revolutionary government.

    Stalin's "Armed Uprising and Our Tactics" and "The Provisional Revolutionary Government and Social Democracy" supported Lenin's policy and opposed the Mensheviks' opportunist line.

    Stalin refuted the Mensheviks, saying: "In France, it was the bourgeoisie who led the revolution, while in Russia it is the proletariat. There, it was the bourgeoisie who dominated the fate of the revolution, while here it is the proletariat. Is it not clear that these two classes cannot have the same results in the event of such a conversion of the revolutionary leadership forces? If in France the bourgeoisie enjoyed the fruits of the revolution because they led the revolution, then in Russia, since it is the proletariat who leads the revolution, should the fruits of the revolution also be enjoyed by the bourgeoisie? Our Mensheviks said: Yes, whatever happened in France must also happen in Russia. These gentlemen are like coffin makers, taking the dimensions of the dead to measure the living." (Page 135) Stalin pointed out: The Mensheviks are "people who can only memorize historical facts and cannot explain the sources of historical facts according to the location and time." (Page 139)

    Afterwards, Stalin continued to refute the Mensheviks in many works. In "On the Current Situation," Stalin compared the Menshevik formula with the Bolshevik formula, saying: "Either the proletariat takes the leadership, or the democratic bourgeoisie takes the leadership -- this is a problem that exists within the Party, this is where our differences of opinion lie." (Page 220) Stalin paid great attention to the issue of armed uprisings, and in this volume there are several works that discuss this issue in detail and summarize the experience.

    In summary, the idea that runs through the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works is the idea of the proletariat's leadership in the revolution. This is also the case in the works on national and land issues.

    Stalin's works are a model of the combination of theory and practice, and also a model of the combination of theoretical profundity and vivid and clear narration. Stalin explained extremely complex issues in a simple and clear way, but they are also extremely precise in logic. He said: "Whoever stands on our position should speak in an unwavering tone." (Page 47)

    It is very clear how important the above-mentioned works of Lenin and Stalin are to the Chinese revolution. The history of the Chinese revolution is the history of how the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively applied the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism to the environment of China, a semi-colonial great power, and enabled the Chinese revolution to achieve victory.

    Stalin said in the preface that this volume was written when "the ideological system and policy of Leninism had not yet been fully formed." After reading the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works, we know even more intimately that Leninism, the ideological system and policy of "Marxism in the era of imperialism," is creative Marxism, that it was formed through countless trials and tribulations, that it is the truth, and that it has an invincible force.

    斯大林全集第一卷  
    陆定一
    斯大林全集第一卷中译本出版了。这对于中国共产党，对于我国人民，对于我国的马克思列宁主义的宣传工作和科学工作，都是重要事件。
    马克思列宁主义学说，在伟大的十月社会主义革命后就在中国传布了。在这个学说的指导之下，中国共产党领导中国人民完成了民主主义的革命，建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。中国人民民主专政的基本任务，就是要在一个相当长的时间内，把经济上落后的和资本主义经济、小商品经济和社会主义经济并存的中国，稳步地逐步地建设和改造成为工业化的和社会主义的繁荣富强的国家。中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的理论水平越高，在人民中间的马克思列宁主义的宣传工作做得越好，我们就越有充分的保证来完成放在我们面前的伟大历史任务。
    十月革命后三十余年来，我国共产党员和进步的知识分子，曾经翻译了不少马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。但只有在人民取得政权之后，我们才有可能着手把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的全部著作，都翻译成中文，介绍到中国来。中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局，现在正是在做这件极有意义的工作。他们的计划，是陆续出版列宁全集和斯大林全集，然后出版马克思恩格斯全集。斯大林全集第一卷中译本的出版，是他们的工作成果第一次与大众见面。
    斯大林全集第一卷里面所载的，是著者在活动初期的作品。这是斯大林在苏联共产党建党的时期和俄国一九○五年革命时期的作品。作为“帝国主义时代的马克思主义”的列宁主义的思想体系和政策，正是在这个时期形成和发展起来的。斯大林在初期活动中，就拥护列宁，协助列宁，对列宁主义的敌人进行斗争。
    斯大林在一九○六年至一九○七年发表的论文“无政府主义还是社会主义？”是斯大林全集第一卷中最重要的著作之一。这篇著作是关于辩证方法、唯物主义和无产阶级社会主义正确的而又通俗的解释。
    这篇著作中关于辩证方法和关于唯物主义的两段，后来在斯大林所写的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”一书中更充分地发展了。如果把两者作一比较的研究，就知道后者的若干主要的观点在“无政府主义还是社会主义？”一文中已经有了简要通俗的说明。
    “无政府主义还是社会主义？”不仅仅是一篇马克思主义哲学的通俗解释，在这篇论文中，斯大林还以新的原理丰富了马克思主义的辩证方法。斯大林在这篇著作中指出：发展是新东西与旧东西的斗争，而新东西在与旧东西的斗争中是不可战胜的。斯大林说：“生活中新产生的、一天天成长的东西是不可克服的，要阻止它的前进是不可能的。这就是说，例如无产阶级，既然它作为一个阶级已在生活中产生并且一天天成长起来，那末不管它今天怎样弱，怎样小，归根到底是会胜利的。为什么呢？因为它在成长、壮大、前进。反之，生活中衰老的、走向坟墓的东西是必遭失败的，哪怕它今天还显得是一个强壮的力量。这就是说，例如资产阶级，既然它在逐渐失去立足的基地，日益向后倒退，那末不管它今天还怎样强，怎样大，归根到底是必遭失败的。为什么呢？因为它作为一个阶级已在腐朽、削弱、衰老而成为生活中的累赘。”（二七五页）大家知道，这个道理在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”一书中有了更精确的叙述，并且构成了辩证法理论最新发展的重要部分。
    在这篇著作的第三部分中，除了如著者自序所说的“社会主义革命胜利的主要条件之一是要无产阶级占人口的多数”一点是“老一辈马克思主义者某些后来显得陈旧了的观点”之一，必须代以在一九一五至一九一六年间产生的列宁的社会主义革命理论，即“社会主义革命不一定在资本主义最发达的国家里获得胜利，而首先会在资本主义阵线薄弱、无产阶级比较容易冲破这个阵线、资本主义即使只有中等发展水平的国家里获得胜利”以外，斯大林以鲜明的逻辑，深刻地阐明了资本主义社会，社会主义社会，阶级斗争，社会主义革命和无产阶级专政，工人的组织和工人阶级政党等无产阶级革命斗争中的最基本问题。斯大林的这些解说，至今仍然保有充分的力量，至今仍然是关于无产阶级的社会主义的基本观念的最好读本。当我国正在过渡到社会主义的时候，学习斯大林的这一著作，明白资本主义是一条死路，社会主义才是光明大道，明白无产阶级和劳动人民必须为社会主义而斗争，对于认识和执行当前党的总路线是有巨大意义的。
    斯大林全集第一卷中所有的著作，贯穿着工人阶级在革命中的领导权的思想。斯大林的著作有系统地告诉我们：就在工人阶级对革命的领导权这个观点上，列宁主义的思想体系和政策形成和发展起来。
    革命的终极目的是什么？革命者应该把希望寄托于什么人？这个问题，在列宁和普列哈诺夫对民粹派的斗争中，已经解决了。斯大林在自己的著作中用极大的明确性和热情来拥护列宁的观点而给当时在南高加索活动的各种资产阶级的、小资产阶级的、经济主义的、民族主义的和无政府主义的派别以致命的打击。斯大林写道：“只有革命无产阶级才负有解放人类并为全世界谋幸福的历史使命。”
  （六页）“我们看到，不断成长壮大、永远前进并为未来而斗争的唯一阶级就是城市和乡村的无产阶级。因此，我们应当为无产阶级服务，应当把自己的希望寄托在它身上。”怎样为无产阶级服务呢？斯大林说：“我们的主要任务是促进资本主义所有制的消灭和社会主义所有制的建立。”（三○二—三○三页）
    革命的当前目的是什么？当时俄国的革命，其性质还不是社会主义革命，而是民主主义革命，即推翻沙皇专制制度的革命。在这个革命中，工人阶级是否应当去参加，并取得领导权呢？在四五十年前俄国共产党人与机会主义者曾为这个问题而展开剧烈的斗争。斯大林在一九○一年十月所写的“俄国社会民主党及其当前任务”中，主张工人阶级应该领导民主革命。他那时就说：“一部分‘社会民主主义者’对于问题的看法是多么狭隘，他们竟想把工人运动局限在经济斗争和各种经济组织的范围里，把政治斗争让给‘知识界’、大学生和社会人士去进行，而只让工人充当配角。历史教导我们，在这样的情况之下，工人就只好为资产阶级火中取栗。”斯大林分析了资产阶级的特性，即（一）在反对专制制度的斗争中，资产阶级常常乐于利用工人的力量，但当胜利已经取得时，他们就把胜利的果实据为己有，使工人一无所得；（二）资产阶级时时刻刻惧怕共产主义的“赤色魔影”，所以只要得到沙皇政府的一点点与自己有利的让步，就无耻地出卖自由事业。因此“只有工人阶级才是真正民主主义可靠的砥柱。”“为了能起领导作用，工人阶级就必须组织成一个独立的政党。”（二三——二四页）
    这是列宁主义的思想。这与当时的机会主义是完全相反的。当时的机会主义者，就是“经济派”和孟什维克（即“少数派”）。“经济派”是伯恩施坦的信徒，他们干脆认为只要做做经济斗争，不需要任何革命斗争，就可以实现社会主义，甚至宣称推翻专制制度的斗争完全是多余的，政治自由是和沙皇制度可以相容的。这就是完全取消革命。孟什维克则主张民主革命应由资产阶级来领导，工人阶级不应当在民主革命中去争取领导权。这就也是取消革命。大家知道，在与这些机会主义者斗争的过程中，列宁写了“做什么？”“进一步，退两步”和“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”，为苏联共产党奠定了思想的、组织的和策略的基础。斯大林在这个斗争中坚决拥护列宁，与机会主义斗争。
    机会主义的根源，首先是在于崇拜工人运动自发性而降低社会主义意识在工人运动中的作用。俄国的“经济派”就是这种机会主义的标本。他们认为，工人运动无须有马克思主义的政党的领导，工人运动会自发地产生出社会主义思想体系来；“运动就是一切，而意识却是微不足道的”。他们主张所谓“纯粹的工人运动”，“反对任何非工人出身的知识分子（那怕是社会主义的知识分子）”。（列宁文选两卷本第一卷，莫斯科版二○八页）他们醉心于经济斗争，说“必须赋予经济斗争以政治性质”（即是说，把经济斗争解释为政治斗争，也即是说，把政治斗争降低到经济改良），但“他们竟没有能力向工人群众说明运动的最终目的是社会主义，甚至没有能力向工人群众说明当前的目标是推翻专制制度，更可悲的是他们认为这一切不但无益，而且是有害的。”（一四页）
    列宁在“做什么？”一书中，详尽地驳斥了
  “经济派”。列宁的名言是：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”
    斯大林在“略论党内意见分歧”一文中，拥护列宁的主张。在这篇文章中，斯大林综述了“做什么？”一书的要点，然后说：
    “什么是没有工人运动的科学社会主义呢？——这好像是放在船上不用的罗盘，只会生锈，结果只好把它扔到海里去。
    “什么是没有社会主义的工人运动呢？——这好像是一只没有罗盘的大船，虽然也能驶到彼岸，但是有了罗盘，到达彼岸就会快得多，危险也会少一些。
    “把这两件东西结合起来就会有一只很好的大船，它会一直驶向彼岸，安然靠近码头。
   “把工人运动和社会主义结合起来，就会有社会民主主义运动，它会一直向前猛进，到达‘乐土’。
      “所以，社会民主党（而不只是社会民主党的知识分子）的责任就是把社会主义和工人运动结合起来，把社会主义意识灌输到工人运动中去，因而赋予自发的工人运动以社会民主主义的性质。”（九一页）
    斯大林论证了：“自发运动就是没有社会主义的工人运动，‘就是工联主义’（列宁：“做什么？”），而工联主义是不愿看见资本主义范围以外的任何东西的。”（八五页）
    斯大林论证了：工人运动自发地倾向于社会主义，但是处在被剥削被奴役地位的无产阶级自己不能创造出社会主义的思想体系。创造科学的社会主义的，是科学的代表人物，是资产阶级的知识阶层中的个别分子，即共产主义的知识分子，如马克思和恩格斯。所以社会主义意识只能从外面灌输到工人运动中去。
    斯大林的“答‘社会民主党人报’”一文（一四三页），和注释第四十六条（三七○页）是很重要的。斯大林这篇著作曾受到当时侨居外国的布尔什维克中央的热烈欢迎。列宁并在“无产者报”上加以介绍，认为是“对于‘从外面灌输意识’这一有名问题的绝妙提法”。
    俄国共产党人，在与民粹派进行斗争的同时，曾在十九世纪九十年代（大约是从一八九四年到一九○一年），决意专在工人中间工作而严厉斥责离开这项工作的一切企图，这是“很自然而正当的”，因为“当时全部任务都是要在工人阶级中间巩固起来”。（列宁文选第一卷二五三页）一九○一年，因为欧洲的工业危机，俄国工人中爆发了政治罢工，马克思主义者的人数也增多了。这时候，组织马克思主义政党以领导工人和各阶层人民的政治斗争，是绝对必要了。反对“经济派”的斗争，使对于马克思主义政党的必要性的认识深入人心，因而奠定了党的思想基础。
    但是，建立马克思主义政党的问题，又遇到孟什维克（“少数派”）的阻碍。列宁写了“进一步，退两步”一书，驳斥孟什维克。这部著作为马克思主义政党奠定了组织基础。斯大林所著“无产阶级和无产阶级政党”，拥护列宁的主张，反对孟什维克。
    斯大林说：“无产阶级政党作为一个战斗的领导集团，第一，按成员数量来说，它应当比无产阶级小得多；第二，按觉悟程度和经验来说，它应当比无产阶级更高些；第三，它应当是一个团结一致的组织。”（五六页）
    孟什维克主张党应当是个人的凑合。他们认为，做一个党员，只要有两个条件就够了，即是承认党纲，和经常协助党。布尔什维克主张党应当是集中的组织，党员应有三个条件，即是承认党纲、给党以物质帮助，并参加党的一个组织。斯大林解释这第三个条件的重要性说：“要做一个党员，就必须实现党的纲领、策略和组织观点；要实现党的观点，就必须为这种观点而斗争；要为这种观点而斗争，就必须在党的组织中工作并和党一起工作。显然，要做一个党员，必须参加党的一个组织。只有当我们参加了党的一个组织，因而把我们个人的利益和党的利益融为一体的时候，我们才能成为党员。”（五八——五九页）斯大林指出，孟什维克所主张组织的那样的党，是“无组织的组织”，是“宴会”，而不是集中的组织，不是领导者的组织。
    孟什维克不愿意有一个马克思主义的集中的党的组织，因为它本来不要革命。这在关于策略问题的争论中完全暴露出来了。一九○五年，当工人在许多城市进行武装斗争的时候，孟什维克反对由工人阶级来领导民主革命，反对组织武装起义。孟什维克死啃住法国资产阶级革命的历史，认为资产阶级民主革命的领导权只能属于资产阶级；凡是在法国那里发生过的，在俄国这里同样应当发生，要想在俄国实现欧洲尚未实现的东西，那是根本办不到的。他们看不见并且不愿意去看见这样的事实，即在法国革命时领导革命的是资产阶级，而在当时的俄国，因为资本主义已经发展到帝国主义的阶段，因为无产阶级已有更高的觉悟，因为马克思主义的政党已经存在，虽然革命的性质仍旧是资产阶级民主主义的革命，但能够领导这个革命使之彻底实现的，已经不是资产阶级，而是无产阶级了。
    列宁著作了“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”一书，提出了“马克思主义政党在资产阶级民主革命中策略问题的新方针，而与从前在马克思主义者武库中存在过的策略方针根本不同”，（苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本一一四页，一九四九年九月解放社版）即是无产阶级成为资产阶级革命的领袖与领导者的方针，即是把资产阶级逐出领导舞台并结成工农联盟的方针。列宁在这一著作中提出了新的社会主义革命论，即是在无产阶级领导之下，完成民主革命，立刻由民主革命开始过渡到社会主义革命。斯大林说：“这是新的社会主义革命论，认定社会主义革命不会是由孤独无援的无产阶级反对全部资产阶级来实现，而是由身为领导者，拥有半无产者民众，即千百万‘被剥削劳动群众’为同盟者的无产阶级来实现。“依照这个理论，无产阶级与农民结成联盟的条件下所实现的无产阶级在资产阶级革命中的领导权，应当转变为无产阶级与其余被剥削劳动群众结成联盟的条件下所实现的无产阶级在社会主义革命中的领导权；而工农民主专政则应为无产阶级社会主义专政准备基础。”（苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本一二二页，一九四九年九月解放社版）
    两条路线，两个策略，当时表现在两个决议案上。布尔什维克的路线，以“俄国社会民主工党第三次代表大会决议”为代表，主张党应当组织人民的武装起义，和参加成为人民胜利起义机关的临时革命政府。孟什维克的路线，以“代表会议”的决议为代表，主张“社会民主党不应当抱定夺取政权或在临时政府中分得政权的目的”，即是反对组织人民武装起义来推翻沙皇专制政府，和反对参加临时革命政府。
    斯大林的“武装起义和我们的策略”和“临时革命政府和社会民主党”两篇著作，拥护列宁的方针，反对孟什维克的机会主义路线。
    斯大林驳斥孟什维克说：“在法国，领导革命的是资产阶级，在俄国则是无产阶级。在那里，支配革命命运的是资产阶级，在这里则是无产阶级。在革命领导力量这样转换的情形下，这两个阶级决不能有同等的结果，难道还不明白吗？如果说在法国，资产阶级因领导革命而享受了革命的果实，那末在俄国，既然领导革命的是无产阶级，难道革命的果实也应由资产阶级来享受吗？我们的孟什维克说道：是的，凡是在法国那里发生过的，在俄国这里同样应当发生。这些先生好像棺材匠一样，拿早已死去的人的尺寸来量活人。”（一三五页）斯大林指出：孟什维克是“仅会死记历史事实而不能依据地点和时间去解释历史事实的来源的人。”（一三九页）
    往后，斯大林继续在许多著作中驳斥孟什维克。在“论目前形势”中，斯大林对比了孟什维克的公式和布尔什维克的公式，说道：“或者是无产阶级掌握领导权，或者是民主资产阶级掌握领导权，——这就是党内存在着的一个问题，这就是我们意见分歧的所在。”（二二○页）斯大林非常注意武装起义的问题，在本卷中有好几篇著作详细论列这个问题，总结了经验。
    总起来说，贯穿斯大林全集第一卷的思想，是无产阶级在革命中领导权的思想。在论及民族问题和土地问题的著作中，也是这样。
    斯大林的著作是理论与实践相结合的典范，又是理论的深刻性和叙述的生动明了相结合的典范。斯大林把极为复杂的问题讲得浅显明白，但逻辑上又是极其精确。他说：“凡是站在我们立场上的人，就应当以坚定不移的口吻讲话。”（四七页）
    列宁斯大林的上述这些著作对于中国革命具有何等重要的意义，是很明白的。中国革命的历史，就是中国共产党在毛泽东同志的领导下，把马克思列宁主义的学说，创造性地应用到中国这样一个半殖民地大国的环境中来，使中国革命取得胜利的历史。
    斯大林在自序中说：这一卷是在“列宁主义的思想体系和政策尚未完全形成”的时候写的。我们读了斯大林全集第一卷之后，就更加亲切地知道，作为“帝国主义时代的马克思主义”的列宁主义思想体系和政策，是创造性的马克思主义，它是经过千锤百炼而形成的，它是真理，它具有不可战胜的力量。
