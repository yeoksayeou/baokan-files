    Selling Grain to the State for National Construction
    Rao Jindong Mutual Aid Team Prepares to Sell All Surplus Grain
    On October 19th, the members of the Rao Jindong Mutual Aid Team in Bili Township, Luoyuan County, Fujian Province, held a meeting to discuss the relationship between national industrialization and the farmers' own interests. Team member Rao Shunquan said, "Only when the country is industrialized can it manufacture large quantities of new agricultural tools and fertilizers for agricultural use, and agricultural production can be better." Team member He Yuchun said, "The more factories the country builds, the more grain will be needed. Our farmers must strive to increase grain production to supply the country's needs." Other team members also believed that national industrial construction is of great benefit to farmers, and farmers should support national industrial construction. Then they calculated the total grain harvested by the team. After deducting food rations, production investment, and public grain contributions, it was estimated that there would be more than 2,500 jin of surplus grain. They originally planned to sell 1,200 jin, but now, for the needs of national industrial construction, they are preparing to sell all the surplus grain to the state.
    
    With State Grain, Commodity Prices Will Not Fluctuate
    In the Zhu Yunshui Mutual Aid Team in Yalinxi Township, Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, many commune members initially did not clearly understand the significance of selling surplus grain to support national construction. Township cadres guided them to do detailed accounting using concrete facts from their daily lives. When talking about the pain that unstable prices brought to farmers in the past, Zhu Yunshui said, "In the past, when prices were unstable, many people sold their large hogs, and in the blink of an eye, they couldn't even afford to buy small piglets." Wang Adeng said, "Thinking about the prices in the past makes people want to cry. One year, I went to Ningbo to sell trees, which were worth 15 shi of rice, but after I took the money home, I could only buy one shi of rice. How good is it now! The price of things is the same in the first half of the year as it is in the second half." Many people said that if the state controls the grain, it can stabilize market prices and develop industry, manufacturing large quantities of means of production and daily necessities for our farmers to use. Then they drew up specific plans to work hard to increase production and save, and to sell surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction. (Zheng Tede)
    
    Elderly People Have Also Eliminated Reluctance to Sell
    After recognizing the significance of increasing production and saving to support national construction, the members of the Lian Quanbao Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Fuzhuang Village, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, broke down their reluctance to sell and actively sold grain to the state. For example, Xin Baoan's mother had suffered from hunger for half her life in the old society, and now she was unwilling to sell even a single grain of her family's surplus. Xin Baoan mobilized his mother, saying, "We are keeping the grain without selling it to the state, but isn't the cotton we use supplied by the state? Now that it's getting cold, a lot of cotton is needed, and the state is transporting cotton in a timely manner, and the price isn't expensive. The price of kerosene and salt that we use all year round is always the same. Isn't this the benefit the state is giving us?" His mother was persuaded and agreed to sell the surplus grain to the state. After education, the entire cooperative's director, Lian Quanbao, took the lead in selling his 350 jin of surplus grain to the state. Under his influence, the entire team sold a total of 9,000 jin of grain to the state. They have signed a combined contract with the Heping Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, ordering production materials such as plowshares, fertilizer powder, Ceresan, and sieves, as well as some daily necessities.

    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Played a Leading Role
    In Sunjiacun Village, Fangmen Township, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, 65 of the 80 households have already organized themselves. Three years ago, there were more than 40 households in difficulty in the village. After last year's bumper harvest, this was reduced to 10 households. This year is even better than last year. No household in the village is short of food, with an average harvest of 1,011 jin of grain per person. On October 27, the Sun Xiangchun Agricultural Production Cooperative took the lead in holding a meeting to discuss increasing production and saving grain to support national economic construction. The cooperative members all believed that the government led the farmers to fight drought and provided many agricultural tools, so they had a bumper harvest this year. Now that the country has begun planned economic construction, farmers must sell their surplus grain to the state to support the country's economic construction in order to further improve their lives in the future. Cooperative member Sun Fushun said, "This year, the state lent us 23 million yuan to buy cattle and agricultural tools, etc. This money will only be paid off in three years; the government also led us to fight drought, so we had a bumper harvest this year. If we don't sell grain to the state, what will the state use to help us?" Then the cooperative members actively sold their surplus grain. In addition to the 40,000 jin already sold, they sold another 7,500 jin of grain to the state. The next day, they started activities outside the cooperative, launching a movement to sell surplus grain to the state throughout the village. In order to facilitate the farmers' sale of grain, the Fangmen Supply and Marketing Cooperative brought banknotes and scales to Sunjiacun Village to purchase grain, and also brought the daily necessities that the farmers needed. The village sold a total of 80,000 jin of grain to the state. After selling the grain, the farmers bought some agricultural tools and cloth, and some also participated in patriotic savings.

    This Is to Protect the Interests of Farmers
    The peasants of Take Township, Eshan County, Yunnan Province, have further raised their ideological awareness by recalling comparisons and specifically settling accounts, realizing that in the past, landlords and unscrupulous merchants speculated and hoarded grain during the autumn harvest, raising prices in May and June, causing great losses to the peasants. After liberation, with state-owned companies, grain bureaus, and supply and marketing cooperatives, grain prices and other prices have been stable. At the same time, the masses also exposed the behavior of unscrupulous merchants who defrauded state loans and lowered prices to buy green grain from peasants. From the above comparison of facts, the peasants further understood that the state's control of grain can not only stabilize prices but also build a large number of industries, so selling surplus grain to the state is to protect the interests of the peasants. In this way, many peasants sold their grain to the state. A peasant surnamed Feng in Diansuo Village sold more than 4,000 jin at once. In five days, the peasants sold 120,000 jin of grain to the state.
    
    Sell Grain to the State, Not to Private Merchants
    The peasants of Wucun Township, Wanquan County, Shanxi Province, have realized the benefits of the state controlling grain through recalling comparisons and are actively selling grain to the state.
    After the cadres explained the important significance of the state purchasing grain, the peasants of Wucun Township improved their patriotic awareness by recalling "who supplied the grain during the spring shortage, and who guaranteed that the grain price would not rise" and comparing the grain market before and after liberation, and realized the benefits of the state controlling grain. Peasant Wei Mingsheng originally wanted to sell 200 jin of wheat to speculative private merchants, but later sold the wheat to the state. He said, "When I had difficulties in the spring this year, I bought more than 200 jin of wheat from the state, and the price wasn't high. If the state hadn't sold grain, I would have suffered a great loss from the speculative private merchants. Now I should still sell the wheat to the state." Du Tianshe said:
  "I bought three shi of wheat back in the spring, which were all transported by the state from Hunan and Hubei. As the saying goes, 'No one transports millet for a thousand miles.' If the Communist Party and the People's Government hadn't thought of a way, then I would have suffered from the speculative private merchants." Many peasants also said that selling grain to the state is to support industrial construction. With the development of industry, agriculture can develop even more. By the end of August, the peasants in this township had sold more than 27,000 jin of wheat to the state.
    
    Martyr's Family Actively Sells Grain to the State
    Ma Sandong, a 71-year-old veteran, a family member of a volunteer martyr in Shizhao Village, the Third District, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, actively sold more than 1,300 jin of surplus wheat and more than 1,500 jin of millet to the state. He said: This year, I was able to have a bumper harvest because Chairman Mao led us well, and everyone took good care of me and cultivated the land for me. I want to sell the surplus grain to the state to support our great production and construction. He also said that although there is surplus grain after eating and drinking, we must still be frugal and increase production. (Lu Mingshan, Wang Jiajun)
    
    Selling Surplus Grain, Repaying Agricultural Loans
    After the autumn harvest, the Dongxiang ethnic farmers in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Gansu Province actively sold surplus grain to the state, prepaid patriotic public grain, and repaid overdue agricultural loans to support national construction. This year, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, the Dongxiang ethnic farmers in the autonomous region overcame natural disasters, and some areas also achieved bumper harvests. The Dongxiang ethnic farmers expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government and actively responded to the call of the People's Government. In the prepayment of patriotic public grain, they put forward the slogan "Pay one day of grain earlier, add one point of strength to national construction earlier", and carried out competitions such as comparing cleanliness and comparing quality to ensure the quality of public grain. The prepayment of public grain began in late October, and so far, 80% of the scheduled grain payment task has been completed. The Dongxiang ethnic farmers are also very active in repaying overdue loans and selling surplus grain. In the past half month, the total amount of overdue loans repaid in the region has reached more than 300 million yuan; more than 50,000 jin of grain have been sold to the state.

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    饶金栋互助组准备出售全部余粮
    福建省罗源县碧里乡饶金栋互助组的组员们，十月十九日，开会讨论国家工业化和农民的切身关系，组员饶顺泉说：“国家工业化了，才能制造大批的新式农具和肥料供农业使用，农业生产才能搞得更好。”组员何裕春说：“国家工厂办得越多，粮食的需要也就越多，我们农民就得努力增产粮食，供给国家需要。”其他组员也都认为：国家工业建设对农民有极大好处，农民应该支持国家工业建设。接着便计算全组所收的粮食，除口粮、生产投资和缴公粮外，估计还能多余二千五百多斤，原来打算卖出一千二百斤，现在为了国家工业建设需要，准备把全部余粮卖给国家。
    国家有粮食物价就不会波动
    浙江省象山县雅林溪乡朱运水互助组内，开始很多社员对卖余粮支持国家建设的意义认识不清。乡干部就以日常生活中的具体事实引导他们算细账。在谈起过去物价不稳所带给农民的痛苦时，朱运水说：“过去物价不稳，很多人卖掉了大毛猪，转眼间就连小毛猪也买不到了。”王阿登说：“想起过去的物价，人会哭死，有一年我到宁波卖了树，值十五石米，把钱拿到家放一放，就只能买一石米了。现在多好啊！上半年东西是什么价，下半年还是什么价。”很多人都说，国家掌握了粮食，就能稳定市场价格，同时又能发展工业，制造出大批生产资料和生活用品供我们农民使用。接着他们便订出了努力增产节约、把余粮卖给国家，支持国家经济建设的具体计划。　（郑悌德）
    老年人也消除了惜售思想
    山西陵川县复庄村连全保农林畜牧合作社的社员们，认识到增产节约支援国家建设的意义后，打破惜售思想，纷纷把粮卖给国家。如辛保安的母亲由于过去在旧社会里挨了半辈子的饿，现在家里的余粮一粒也不肯卖。辛保安就动员他母亲说：“咱们放着粮食不卖给国家，可是咱们用的棉花不是国家给咱供应的吗？现在天冷要大量用棉花了，国家就及时运来棉花，价钱也不贵。我们一年到头用的煤油、食盐，价钱总是那个样。这不是国家给我们的好处吗？”他的母亲被说服后，就同意把余粮卖给国家。全体社员经过教育后，社长连全保首先把自己的三百五十斤余粮卖给国家。在他的影响下，全组共卖给国家九千斤粮食，他们已和平城镇供销社订立结合合同，订买了犁面犁铧、肥田粉、赛力散、箩头等生产资料以及一部分生活用品。

    农业生产合作社起了带头作用
    浙江奉化县方门乡孙家村八十来户农家已有六十五户组织起来了，三年前全村有四十多户困难户，去年丰收后减少到十户，今年比去年更好，全村没有一户缺粮，平均每人收一千零十一斤粮。十月二十七日，孙祥春农业生产合作社首先开会，讨论增产节约粮食，支持国家经济建设。社员们都认为政府领导农民抗旱，又贷给许多农具，今年才获得丰收，现在国家已开始有计划的经济建设，农民为了将来进一步地改善生活，必须把余粮卖给国家、支援国家的经济建设。社员孙付顺说：“今年上半年国家贷给我们二千三百万元，买牛和农具等，这些钱三年才付清；政府又领导我们抗旱才得到今年丰收。如果我们不把粮食卖给国家，国家拿什么来帮助我们呢？”接着社员便纷纷出卖余粮，除前已卖出的四万斤外，再卖七千五百斤粮食给国家。第二天，他们便向社外活动，在全村内掀起了一个向国家卖余粮的运动。方门供销社为了便利农民卖粮，便带着钞票、磅称来到孙家村收购，同时还带来了农民们需要的日用物品。该村前后共卖了八万斤粮食给国家。农民卖粮后除买些农具和布匹外，有的还参加了爱国储蓄。

    这就是为了保护农民的利益
    云南峨山县塔克乡农民，经过回忆对比、具体算账的方法，进一步提高了思想觉悟，认识到过去地主、奸商在秋收时投机囤积粮食，到五月六月时便抬高市价，使农民吃了很大的亏。解放后，有了国营公司、粮食局和供销社，粮价和其他物价都平稳了。同时，群众还揭发了奸商骗取国家贷款压低价格收买农民青谷的行为。从以上事实对比中，农民们进一步懂得国家掌握了粮食既能稳定物价，又可以大量建设工业，因此，把余粮卖给国家也就是为了保护农民的利益。这样，好多农民都把粮食卖给国家，点索村有一个姓冯的农民一次就卖了四千多斤。在五天的时间内，农民们就卖了十二万斤粮食给国家。
    把粮卖给国家，不卖给私商
    山西省万泉县吴村乡农民通过回忆对比，认识了国家掌握粮食的好处，踊跃把粮食卖给国家。
    吴村乡农民听干部讲解了国家收购粮食的重要意义以后，通过回忆“春季缺粮是谁供给的，粮价没有涨是谁保证的”，对比解放前后粮食市场的情况，提高了爱国主义的觉悟，认识了国家掌握粮食的好处。农民卫明生本来想把二百斤小麦卖给投机私商，后来把这些小麦卖给了国家。他说：“今年春季我生活困难时，籴了国家二百多斤小麦，价钱不大。若不是国家卖粮，我就要吃投机私商的大亏。现在我还是应该把麦子粜给国家。”杜天赦说：
  “春季我籴回三石麦，这都是国家从湖南、湖北运来的。古语说‘千里不贩粟’，若不是共产党和人民政府给想办法，那就非挨投机私商的杆子不可。”许多农民还说：把粮食卖给国家，就是支援工业建设。工业发展了，农业才能更加发展。这个乡的农民，到八月底已卖给国家两万七千多斤小麦。
    烈属积极卖粮给国家
    山西省榆次县第三区使赵村志愿军烈属、七十
  一岁的马三东老大爷，积极把余粮小麦一千三百斤和小米一千五百余斤卖给国家。他说：今年我能够丰产，这都是因为毛主席领导得好，大家对我照顾得好，代耕得好。我要把余粮卖给国家，支援咱们的生产大建设。并且说，虽然打下的粮食，除了吃喝还有余，可是还要省吃俭用，增加生产。
                          （卢明山　王家骏）
    出售余粮、归还农贷
    甘肃省东乡自治区的东乡族农民，在秋收后踊跃向国家出售余粮、预缴爱国公粮和归还到期的农业贷款，支援国家建设。今年自治区东乡族农民在人民政府的领导和帮助下，战胜了自然灾害，有些地区并得到了丰收。东乡族农民对人民政府表示衷心感激，积极响应人民政府的号召。在预缴爱国公粮中，他们提出“早缴一天粮，早给国家建设增添
  一分力量”的口号，并进行比干净，比好等竞赛，保证了公粮的质量。十月下旬开始预缴公粮，到目前已完成预定缴粮任务的百分之八十。东乡族农民对归还到期贷款和出售余粮也很踊跃，在最近半个月来，全区归还的到期贷款已达三亿多元；卖给国家的粮食已有五万多斤。　（新华社）
