    The CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee convened a provincial meeting of Party member cadres in late October to convey and study the general line for the transition period. Participants included secretaries and members of local Party committees, municipal Party committees, and county Party committees, secretaries of district committees, and Party member cadres at or above the section chief level from provincial-level agencies.

    At the meeting, Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, delivered a report on the general line and general tasks for the transition period. After the report, the secretaries and members of local Party committees, municipal Party committees, and county Party committees, as well as the secretaries of district committees, concentrated on studying Tan Zhenlin's report, linking it to their own thinking and current practical work for discussion. Based on the ideological improvement after the study, they determined the rural work tasks for this winter and next spring.

    During the study process, everyone further clarified their understanding of the general line and general tasks for the transition period, recognizing the necessity of gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the country over a considerable period, and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, as well as the main tasks for carrying out the transformation. Everyone's mood was extremely excited. Some people previously believed that the implementation of socialism was decades away, but now they realized that they were already transitioning to socialism. Some said, "After the land reform, in my rural work, I talked about developing production every day and engaged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement every day, but I didn't know that this was the implementation of the socialist transformation of agriculture. Listening to the report has opened my eyes."

    Some cadres, during the study, were ideologically confused about the issue of realizing socialist industrialization as the basic task of the country during the transition period. After repeated discussions on the important significance of developing industry for consolidating national defense and fundamentally improving the lives of farmers and the people of the whole country, their understanding changed. The provincial Party committee also organized the cadres attending the meeting to visit factories. During the visits, all the cadres personally experienced the superiority of modern industry and more deeply realized that only agricultural collectivization and the use of machine production is the only way for all farmers to move towards a prosperous life, thereby further recognizing the important significance of developing industry and the close relationship between industry and agriculture, workers and farmers. Many people criticized their own backward and conservative thinking and resolved to arm themselves with the advanced ideology of the working class.

    During the discussion on the socialist transformation of agriculture, all the secretaries of district committees also had a deep understanding of the characteristics of the small-peasant economy, the harmfulness of capitalist forces in rural areas, and the important significance of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. All the secretaries of district committees criticized the lack of vigilance and understanding of the dangers of the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism, recognizing that the small-peasant economy is unstable and its economic strength is weak. Once it encounters natural disasters or because of insufficient labor, living standards will decline. Therefore, the small-peasant economy can never lead all farmers to a prosperous life. Only by developing mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas, gradually uniting small farmers, and taking the socialist road can all farmers become prosperous. Many secretaries of district committees, on the basis of improving their ideological understanding, realized that their past lack of confidence in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and complaining about headaches were wrong. They also analyzed that the main reason why they did not do a good job in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past was because they did not understand socialism, and therefore could not vigorously and correctly publicize this truth to the farmers. Li Shiyuan, secretary of the Wangji District Committee of Siyang County, said, "After I go back, I must strengthen the propaganda of the country's general line for the transition period to the farmers and better carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement."

    All the cadres attending the meeting improved their ideological understanding and clarified their goals after the study. The eleven secretaries of district committees from Donghai County who attended the meeting also wrote a letter to the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee before the end of the meeting, guaranteeing that after returning to their districts, they would mobilize all Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to study the country's general line for the transition period and universally and deeply publicize the country's general line for the transition period to the masses. They guaranteed that in the winter work, with production as the center, they would consolidate, improve, and develop the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in each district on the existing basis.

    After the conference, the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee immediately dispatched more than 3,000 cadres and students from provincial Party committee, regional Party committee and other directly affiliated agencies and Party schools to various counties to assist in the work, and each county was equipped with a cadre at the level of a regional Party committee member to specifically help the county Party committee to vigorously carry out propaganda on the country's general line for the transition period, promote the rural winter increase production and practice economy campaign, and carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. Ke Qingshi, secretary of the provincial Party committee, Guan Wenwei, deputy secretary, and others also personally went deep into various counties to strengthen their leadership over this work. Up to now, in rural areas, more than 100,000 county, district, and township-level cadres are concentrating on a comprehensive study of the general line and general tasks under the leadership of the county Party committees of the CCP. Through them, the general line and general tasks will be made known to every household in the vast countryside.

    Many district and township cadres said after listening to the report: In the past, they were like blind people, confused and only knew that socialism was good, but they did not know when it could be realized. Now that they have a clear understanding of the path to transition to socialism, they are more motivated to work. District and township cadres in Danyang, Jurong, Chongming, and other places have taken the lead in selling grain to the state. In Jurong County, 194 district and township cadres voluntarily signed up to sell 130,000 jin of grain to the state.

    The propaganda departments of the Party committees of nine cities, including Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, and Suzhou, have also vigorously organized report speakers, propagandists, and various propaganda tools to carry out large-scale propaganda activities throughout the city. Before 500 report speakers in Nanjing set out to report to people from all walks of life, the responsible cadres of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CCP first gave them a demonstration report and regularly checked and supervised their work. Now, in Nanjing, 200,000 state organ cadres, workers, cultural and educational workers, shop assistants, industrialists and merchants, and residents have heard the reports. In the other eight cities, including Wuxi, Suzhou, and Xuzhou, more than 200,000 cadres and people have also been educated. After listening to the reports on the country's general line and general tasks for the transition period, the vast number of cadres and people are more enthusiastic in their work, study, and production. Many workers have expressed their desire to strive to be meritorious and exemplary in the great cause of building socialism.

    中共江苏省委召开全省党员干部会议
    学习国家过渡时期的总路线收获很大
    南京等九城市有四十多万人受到总路线的教育
    中共江苏省委于十月下旬召开全省党员干部会议，传达和学习国家在过渡时期的总路线。参加会议的有各地委、市委、县委书记、委员、区委书记及省级机关科长以上党员干部等。
    会上，中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林同志作了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务报告。报告结束后，各地委、市委、县委书记和委员及区委书记曾分别集中学习了谭震林同志的报告，联系思想及当前各项实际工作进行讨论，在学习后思想提高的基础上，确定了今冬明春的农村工作任务。
    大家在学习过程中，进一步明确认识了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，认识到在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造的必要性，以及实行改造的几项主要工作。大家的情绪极为兴奋，过去有人认为实行社会主义是在几十年以后的事，现在才知道今天已经在向社会主义过渡了。有的说：“土地改革以后，我在农村工作中，天天讲发展生产，天天在搞互助合作运动，但不知道这就是实行对农业的社会主义改造，听了报告，使我眼睛亮起来了。”
    有些干部在学习中，对实现社会主义工业化是国家在过渡时期的基本任务这一问题，思想上弄不通。在反复讨论了发展工业对巩固国防、从根本上改善农民及全国人民生活的重要意义后，认识就有了转变。省委并组织到会干部参观工厂。在参观中，全体干部亲身体会到近代化工业的优越性，更深刻地认识到只有农业集体化，使用机器生产，才是使全体农民走向富裕生活的唯一道路，从而进一步认识到发展工业的重要意义，以及工业和农业，工人和农民之间的密切关系。不少人批判了自己的落后保守思想，决心以先进的工人阶级思想武装自己。
  在讨论对农业实行社会主义改造的问题时，全体区委书记对小农经济的特点，农村资本主义势力的危害性，以及互助合作运动的重要意义也有了深刻的认识。全体区委书记批判了对农村资本主义自发势力的危险缺乏警惕和认识，认识到小农经济是不稳定的，它的经济力量是薄弱的，一旦遇到自然灾害，或者因为劳动力不够，生活就会下降。所以，小农经济绝不可能使全体农民走上富裕的道路，只有在农村中发展互助合作，使小农户逐步联合起来，走社会主义的道路，才能使全体农民富裕起来。不少区委书记在提高了思想认识的基础上，认识到自己过去对互助合作运动缺乏信心，喊头痛是不对的，并且分析了过去所以搞不好互助合作运动的主要原因是由于自己不了解社会主义，因而也不可能向农民大张旗鼓地正确地宣传这一真理。泗阳县王集区区委书记李士元说：“我回去后一定要加强对农民进行国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传，更好地开展互助合作运动。”
    到会全体干部经过学习，提高了思想认识，弄清了前进目标。东海县到会的十一个区委书记，在会议结束前，还写信给中共江苏省委，保证回区后要动员所有党员、团员和干部，学习国家在过渡时期的总路线，并普遍地、深入地向群众进行国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传。保证在冬季工作中，以生产为中心，将各区的互助合作组织，在现有基础上进行巩固提高和发展。
    中共江苏省委在大会结束后，即由省委、地委等各直属机关和党校，抽派出干部、学员三千多人，分赴各县协助工作，每县并配备有地委委员级干部一人，具体帮助县委，大张旗鼓地进行国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传，推动农村冬季的增产节约运动，进行农业的社会主义改造。省委书记柯庆施、副书记管文蔚等，也都亲自深入各县加强对这一工作的领导。到目前止，在农村中，有十万余县、区和乡一级的干部，在中共各县县委领导下，集中进行总路线和总任务的全面学习。通过他们，将使总路线和总任务在广大乡村中作到家喻户晓。
    很多区乡干部听了报告后说：从前像瞎子一样，糊里糊涂，只知道社会主义好，但不知道什么时候才能实现。现在明确认识了过渡到社会主义的道路后，工作劲头更大了。丹阳、句容、崇明等地的区乡干部纷纷带头把粮食卖给国家。句容县一百九十四个区乡干部，自动报名卖给国家的粮食就有十三万斤。
    南京、无锡、徐州、苏州等九个城市的党委宣传部门，也大力组织报告员、宣传员和各种宣传工具，在全市进行大规模的宣传活动。南京市五百名报告员在出发向各阶层人民作报告前，中共南京市委负责干部首先向他们作了示范报告，并经常检查督促他们的工作。现在南京市听到报告的国家机关干部、工人、文教工作者、店员、工商业者和居民等已达二十万人。其他无锡、苏州、徐州等八个城市也有二十多万干部和人民群众受到教育。广大干部和人民群众在听了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的报告后，工作、学习和生产都更加起劲了。许多工人表示要在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，争取做功臣和模范。
