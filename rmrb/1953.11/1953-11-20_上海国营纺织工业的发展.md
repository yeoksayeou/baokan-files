    The Development of Shanghai's State-Owned Textile Industry
    Zhang Chengzong, Director of the East China Textile Administration Bureau

    Since liberation, Shanghai's state-owned textile industry has rapidly recovered and developed. The production of cotton textiles, printing and dyeing, knitting,麻袋 (ma dai - gunny sacks), and other products has exceeded the highest annual output in history. This plays a significant role in consolidating the leadership of state-owned enterprises, leveraging the capacity of existing equipment, accumulating capital for national industrialization, and meeting the people's clothing needs.

    This year marks the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Based on the implementation of the plan by Shanghai's state-owned textile factories over the past eight months, progress has been made compared to the past. From January to August this year, the actual total output value completed 102.6% of the plan, an increase of 29.51% compared to the same period last year. The production volume of major products, such as cotton yarn, completed 101.65% of the plan, an increase of 29.91% compared to the same period last year; cotton thread completed 101.48% of the plan, an increase of 26.45% compared to the same period last year; cotton cloth completed 101.19% of the plan, an increase of 20.75% compared to the same period last year; and colored cloth and printed cloth completed 104.42% of the plan, an increase of 16.96% compared to the same period last year.

    In terms of unit output: the average output of yarn (per thousand spindle hours) for the past eight months was 26.45 kilograms, an increase of 4.71% compared to last year; the average output of cloth (per machine hour) was 4.288 meters, an increase of 3.42% compared to last year.

    Product quality has also gradually improved. For example, the physical properties of cotton yarn have improved year by year. Taking the strength of yarn as an example, based on an average comparison of five main yarn counts: with 1951 as 100, 1952 was 103, and 1953 was 106.54. The defect rate of cotton cloth has also decreased year by year, from 13.6% in 1951 to 4% in 1952, and 3.08% in 1953. In order to meet the needs of the people, the production volume of fabrics such as twill, serge, gabardine, straight-wale drill, khaki, and poplin has been increased this year. New patterns and colors have also been created for printed fabrics, such as the recent Hundred Birds, Peacock Spreading Its Tail, and Rural Delights patterns, which are loved by the general public.

    High end breakage rates are a disaster in cotton textile production. Since April this year, by addressing this key issue and adopting a series of technical measures, the end breakage rate in various factories has decreased month by month. For example, taking 20-count yarn as an example: the average end breakage rate per thousand spindle hours in 1952 was 331.66 ends, 237.6 ends in May this year, 214.3 ends in June, 192.2 ends in July, and 147 ends in August. For example, the end breakage rate of 23-count yarn in August at the State-Owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory was 86.45 ends, a decrease of 42.5% compared to January this year.

    With the development of production, the material and cultural lives of the workers have also gradually improved. The newly constructed worker dormitories this year have a total area of ​​307,186 square meters, including 10,088 family dormitories and 118 single dormitories. The East China Textile Administration Bureau has two hospitals, and the number of beds has been expanded to 835, five times that before liberation. There are 25 nurseries that can accommodate 5,302 infants. This year, in order to improve working conditions in the workshops, cooling equipment was installed in various textile factories, with a total investment of 56 billion yuan. In addition, there are the East China Textile Engineering Institute and the Shanghai Textile Industry School, with 2,800 students currently enrolled.

    In the process of production development, many outstanding workers and model workers have emerged. At the Second National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China this year, among the textile industry labor models selected, workers from Shanghai's state-owned textile factories included Hang Peilan, Fang Siyuan, Yi Shijuan, Wang Jusheng, Zhu Fadi, and 10 others, and two model groups. Forty-one Shanghai textile industry labor models and two municipal model groups were selected in Shanghai. They played a significant role in motivating all employees and implementing the national production plan. At the same time, in order to support the construction of new factories in various regions, 900 cadres and skilled workers were transferred. And an engineering team of 1,300 people was organized to build factories in the Northwest.

    The reason why Shanghai's state-owned textile industry has achieved such results is mainly due to:

    First, under the leadership of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee, all employees were mobilized to discuss the national production plan, education on strengthening the concept of planning was carried out, production targets for workshops and groups were formulated, and the implementation of the plan was regularly checked, thus transforming the national production plan into a program of action for the masses. This established a comprehensive view of planning, initially strengthened planning management, ensured the completion of the plan, and gradually balanced production. For example, among the 19 cotton textile factories, 9 factories were able to overfulfill the cotton yarn production plan on a monthly basis, and 5 factories were able to overfulfill the cotton cloth production plan on a monthly basis. Among them, the better ones, such as the State-Owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, have been able to comprehensively complete the plan on a monthly basis for the past eight months.

    Second, technical management was strengthened, and key issues in production were addressed. For example, cotton textile factories focused on improving quality and reducing end breakage rates, mobilizing technicians and workers, combining technology and labor, and implementing technical measures. In the third quarter, all textile factories universally launched a mass quality inspection campaign, and adopted technical measures and rectified the implementation of work methods based on the specific quality links of each factory. For example, through quality inspections, the quality of cotton yarn at the State-Owned Shanghai No. 1, No. 6, and No. 7 Cotton Textile Factories all improved by one grade in August.

    Strengthening technical management mainly involves uniting and educating technical personnel, focusing on key issues such as increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs, adopting effective technical measures, implementing operating procedures and promoting advanced work methods, conducting regular maintenance and repairs in a planned manner, regularly monitoring temperature and humidity control, strictly testing and inspecting finished and semi-finished products, and establishing and improving the technical responsibility system and the organizational structure of technical departments.

    Third, the problem of cooling workshops in cotton textile factories in summer was basically solved, overcoming the adverse effects of the hot summer season on production and working conditions. By the beginning of July this year, the construction of cold air equipment in various factories had been completed. 75% of the spindles were in fine spinning rooms where the maximum temperature did not exceed 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and 68% of the looms were in weaving rooms where the maximum temperature did not exceed 92 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature in the weaving room of the State-Owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory was only 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average temperature in the fine spinning room of the State-Owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, production was still stable during the hottest weather this summer, and the end breakage rate also gradually decreased. Many workers reflected: "Having worked for ten years, I have never had such cool days in summer." They called the workshop "spring in summer!"

    These achievements of Shanghai's state-owned textile industry are favorable conditions for further carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement and ensuring the comprehensive overfulfillment of the 1953 national production plan.

    However, there are still many shortcomings in the process of implementing the plan. First, planning management and technical management are not sound enough, and the comprehensiveness and balance of plan completion are still poor. The quality of products is not stable enough. Production costs are very high, and there is a lot of waste. There are many accidents, and not enough attention is paid to safe production.

    Therefore, according to the central government's instructions on increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, tightening expenditures, and overfulfilling the national production plan, Shanghai's state-owned textile industry launched an increase production and practice economy movement in the fourth quarter to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of the 1953 national production plan and prepare favorable conditions for the 1954 national plan.

    The task of Shanghai's state-owned textile industry is: to continue to strengthen planning management and technical management, to increase production, practice strict economy, and reduce costs on the basis of consolidating and improving quality, and to strive to increase production and practice economy by 220 billion yuan to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of the national production plan.

    In order to successfully complete this task, we must do the following:

    First, strengthen planning management, promote operational plans with emphasis, and establish and improve the necessary responsibility systems, first of all, systems in planning and technical management.

    Second, strengthening technical management, improving production efficiency, leveraging potential strength, strengthening machinery maintenance and repairs, finding shortcuts, promoting advanced experience, carrying out rationalization proposals, and formulating measures to increase production and practice economy are effective measures to continue to consolidate and improve quality.

    Third, practice strict economy, reduce waste, reduce costs, and ensure the overfulfillment of profit delivery. Reduce waste in production, such as losses from defective yarn, defective cloth, recycled silk, white cotton, and defective products. Save raw materials and strengthen material management. Save electricity, coal, and non-production expenses. Strengthen financial supervision and accelerate capital turnover.

    Fourth, implement safe production and strengthen labor protection. All factories should conduct a safety inspection, especially of electrical boilers. The storage, transportation, and construction departments should pay special attention to the safety of handling tools, scaffolding, and high-altitude operations.

    上海国营纺织工业的发展
    华东纺织管理局局长　张承宗
    解放以来，上海国营纺织工业迅速地恢复和发展了。棉纺织、印染、针织、麻袋等产品的生产，均已超过历史上最高年产量。这对于巩固国营企业的领导，发挥现有设备的能力，为国家工业化积累资金，并满足人民衣着需要，是起着很大作用的。
    今年是我国进入第一个五年计划的第一年。根据八个月来上海国营各纺织厂执行计划的情况，比较过去是有进步的。今年一月至八月，实际总产值完成百分之一百零二点六，较去年同期增加百分之二十九点五一。主要产品的生产量如棉纱完成百分之一百零一点六五，较去年同期增加百分之二十九点九一，棉线完成百分之一百零一点四八，较去年同期增加百分之二十六点四五，棉布完成百分之一百零一点一九，较去年同期增加百分之二十点七五，色布和花布完成百分之一百零四点四二，较去年同期增加百分之十六点九六。
    以单位产量来说：今年八个月纱的平均产量（千锭时）是二十六点四五公斤，较去年增加百分之四点七一，布的平均产量（每台时）是四点二八八公尺，较去年增加百分之三点四二。
    在产品质量方面，也逐步地有所提高。如棉纱的物理性状态逐年均有进步，以纱的强力为例，根据五种主要支数纱平均作一比较：以一九五一年为一百，则一九五二年为一百零三，一九五三年为一百零六点五四。棉布的次品率也逐年降低，一九五一年为百分之十三点六，一九五二年为百分之四，一九五三年为百分之三点零八。为了满足人民的需要，今年在品种方面，增加了斜纹、哔叽、华达呢、直贡呢、卡其、府绸等布的生产量。花布的图样颜色，也创造了许多新的花样，如最近的百鸟图，孔雀开屏，农家乐等花布，为广大人民所喜爱。
    断头率高是棉纺织厂生产中的灾难。今年四月以后，由于抓住了这一关键问题，采取了一系列的技术措施，各厂的断头率已逐月降低。如以二十支纱为例：一九五二年千锭时断头率平均为三三一点六六根，今年五月为二三七点六根，六月为二一四点三根，七月为一九二点二根，八月为一四七根。如国营上海第十九棉纺织厂二十三支纱八月份断头率为八六点四五根，比较今年一月降低了百分之四二点五。
    随着生产的发展，职工的物质、文化生活也逐步地得到改善。今年新建筑的工人宿舍，计面积三十万七千一百八十六平方公尺，内眷属宿舍一万零八十八户，单身宿舍一百十八幢。华东纺织管理局有医院两所，病床已扩充到八百三十五张，为解放前的五倍。有托儿所二十五个，可收托婴儿五千三百零二人。今年为了改善车间劳动条件，在各纺织厂装置降温设备，共投资达五百六十亿元。此外，设有华东纺织工学院和上海纺织工业学校，现有学生二千八百人。
    在生产发展过程中，涌现了很多优秀工作者和劳动模范。在今年中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会上，评选出的纺织工业劳动模范中，上海国营纺织厂工人当选的有杭佩兰、房嗣元、裔式娟、王菊生、朱法弟等十五人，和模范小组二个。在上海市选出的上海纺织工业劳动模范有四十一人，和市模范小组二个。他们在带动全体职工，贯彻国家生产计划中起了很大作用。同时为了支援各地新厂的建设，输送了干部及技术工人九百人。并组织了工程队一千三百人到西北建厂。
    上海国营纺织工业所以能获得这样的成绩，主要是由于：
    第一、在中共中央华东局和上海市委的领导下，发动全体职工讨论了国家生产计划，进行了加强计划观念的教育，制订了车间和小组的生产指标，并经常检查计划执行的情况，从而使国家生产计划变成为群众的行动纲领。这样就树立了计划的全面观点，初步加强了计划管理，使完成计划有了保证，并逐步均衡起来。例如在十九个棉纺织厂中，已有九个厂能按月超额完成棉纱的生产计划，有五个厂能按月超额完成棉布的生产计划。其中较好的如国营上海第二棉纺织厂，八个月来能按月全面地完成计划。
    第二、加强技术管理，抓住了生产中的关键问题。如棉纺织厂抓住提高质量，降低断头率的问题，发动技术人员与工人，使技术与劳动相结合，贯彻技术措施。第三季度各纺织厂均普遍地开展了一次群众性的质量检查运动，并针对各厂质量的具体环节，采取了技术措施，整顿了工作法的执行。如国营上海第一、第六、第七等三个棉纺织厂通过质量检查，八月份棉纱品质均提高了一级。
    加强技术管理，主要是团结与教育技术人员，围绕增加产量，提高质量，降低成本的关键问题，采取有效的技术措施，贯彻操作规程和推广先进工作法，有计划地进行保全检修，经常掌握温湿度调节工作，严格试验和检查成品和半制品，建立和健全技术责任制度和技术部门的组织机构。
    第三、基本上解决了棉纺织厂夏季车间降温问题，克服了炎夏季节对生产和劳动条件的不利影响。今年七月初各厂冷风设备工程均已完成。夏天细纱间最高温度不超过华氏九十八度的，占纺锭设备百分之七十五，布机间最高温度不超过华氏九十二度的，占布机设备的百分之六十八。国营上海第六棉纺织厂布机间平均温度只有华氏八十五度，国营上海第十九棉纺织厂细纱间平均温度在华氏九十六点二度。因而今年夏季最热的天气，生产还是很稳定，断头率也逐步降低。很多工人反映：“做了十年的工，夏天从来没有过这样凉快日子。”称车间里是“夏天里的春天！”
    上海国营纺织工业的这些成绩，是今后进一步开展增产节约运动，保证全面地超额完成一九五三年的国家生产计划的有利条件。
    但是在执行计划过程中，也还存在很多缺点。首先是计划管理和技术管理还不健全，完成计划的全面性和均衡性还很差。产品的质量还不够稳定。生产成本很高，浪费很多。事故多，对安全生产不够重视。
    因此，根据中央关于增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，超额完成国家生产计划的指示，上海国营纺织工业在第四季度开展了增产节约运动，以保证全面地超额完成一九五三年的国家生产计划，为一九五四年的国家计划准备有利的条件。
    上海国营纺织工业的任务是：继续加强计划管理和技术管理，在巩固和提高质量的基础上，增加生产、厉行节约、降低成本，为增产节约二千二百亿元，保证全面超额完成国家生产计划而奋斗。
    为了顺利完成这一任务，我们必须做好下列几项工作：
    第一、加强计划管理，有重点地推行作业计划，建立和健全必要的责任制度，首先是计划和技术管理方面的制度。
    第二、加强技术管理、提高生产效率、发挥潜在力量、加强机械保全检修、找窍门、推广先进经验、开展合理化建议、制订增产节约，是继续巩固和提高质量的有效措施。
    第三、厉行节约、减少浪费、降低成本、保证超额完成上缴利润。减少生产中的浪费，如坏纱、坏布、回丝、白花、次品等损失。节约原材料，加强材料管理。节约用电、用煤、非生产开支。加强财务监督、加速资金周转。
    第四、贯彻安全生产、加强劳动保护工作。各厂均进行一次安全检查，特别是电气锅炉。储运、建筑部门特别注意搬运工具、跳板、高空作业的安全。
