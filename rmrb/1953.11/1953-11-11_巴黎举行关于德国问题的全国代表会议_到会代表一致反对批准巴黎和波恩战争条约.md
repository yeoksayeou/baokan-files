Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th dispatch: A national conference on the German question was held in Paris on the 8th, according to TASS. The conference was initiated by a group of French celebrities and political leaders. Those attending the conference held different political views and belonged to different parties. Among them were many members of the National Assembly and members of the Council of the Republic, representatives from various regions, representatives of provincial organizations of former resistance movement participants, and disabled veterans.

All those who spoke at the meeting talked about the great unease felt by all sectors of French society regarding the revival of German militarism under the guise of the "European Defense Community." They emphasized that the Paris and Bonn treaties posed a fatal threat to France.

Henri Breye, a member of the National Assembly of the Popular Republican Movement, said: "For the independence of France and the French army, for peace, we must oppose the Paris and Bonn treaties." Jean Auburtin, Vice Chairman of the Paris Municipal Council, said that people with different views are uniting to take joint action to "oppose this terrible plan." Former Minister Louis Marin also strongly opposed the establishment of a "European Army." He said: "I condemn the Bonn and Paris treaties, and I condemn the adventurous policies that others want to drag us into." National Assembly member Sibert de Chambrun, Professor Bernard Lavergne of the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris, and Leo Hamon, a member of the Council of the Republic of the Popular Republican Movement, all expressed the same views.

Louis Vellefaux, a former participant in the national liberation movement and a writer, said: French patriots and reserve officers will never join an army with "steel helmet" members and the guys who slaughtered the residents of Oradour. Blongu, who was blinded in the war, said: The idea of the "European Army" came from the US government, and this army would be a great disaster for France. All French people are ready to launch a nationwide movement to oppose the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 9th dispatch: The Belgian National Peace Committee issued a communique reporting the preliminary results of an opinion poll on the issue of ratifying the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty.

The communique described the results of an opinion poll conducted in eighteen of the largest enterprises in various provinces. Out of 17,500 votes, 13,875 votes, or about 80 percent, were against the ratification of this treaty; only 353 people voted in favor of ratification. The remaining 3,290 people did not express their opinions.

Among the workers who voted against the ratification of the treaty, those in the ACEC electrical equipment factory in Herstal, Liege Province, accounted for 98 percent of all workers participating in the opinion poll; railway workers at the Tournai station in Hainaut Province accounted for 90.7 percent; and workers in the No. 6 mine of Charleroi in Hainaut Province accounted for 86.1 percent.

    巴黎举行关于德国问题的全国代表会议
    到会代表一致反对批准巴黎和波恩战争条约
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎在八日举行了一个关于德国问题的全国代表会议。会议是由法国一群社会名流和政治领袖发起的。出席会议的是持有不同政治见解、属于不同党派的人们，其中有许多国民议会议员和共和国参议院议员，有各地方的代表、前抵抗运动参加者各省组织的代表和残废军人。
    所有在会上讲话的人都谈到法国各界人士对于在“欧洲防务集团”的幌子下复活德国军国主义一事感到极大的不安。他们强调：巴黎和波恩条约对法国是个致命威胁。
    国民议会人民共和党议员亨利·布雷说：“为了法国和法国军队的独立，为了和平，我们必须反对巴黎和波恩条约。”巴黎市政委员会副主席让·奥博尔坦说，见解不同的人们正在团结起来，采取联合行动来“反对这个可怕的计划”。前部长路易·马兰也竭力反对成立“欧洲军”。他说：“我谴责波恩和巴黎条约，就是谴责别人想把我们拖下水去的冒险政策。”国民议会议员希伯尔·德香布兰、巴黎大学法律系教授伯纳·拉维尔涅和共和国参议院的人民共和党议员利奥·阿蒙，都表示了同样的意见。
    前民族解放运动参加者、作家路易·维勒弗斯说：法国的爱国者和后备军官永远不会和“钢盔队”队员及屠杀奥拉多尔居民的家伙一起加入一支军队。在战争中打瞎了眼睛的布隆古说：“欧洲军”的主意是美国政府出的，这支军队对法国会是一个很大的祸患。所有的法国人民都准备发动一个全国范围的运动，来反对批准波恩和巴黎条约。
   【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔九日讯：比利时全国和平委员会发表公报，报道在批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约的问题上举行民意测验的初步结果。
    公报叙述了在各省十八个最大的企业中举行民意测验的结果。在一万七千五百张票中，有一万三千八百七十五票，即约有百分之八十，是反对批准这个条约的；只有三百五十三人投票赞成批准条约。其余三千二百九十人没有表示意见。
    投票反对批准这个条约的工人，在列日省赫斯塔尔地方的阿萨斯电气装备工厂中，占全部参加民意测验的工人百分之九十八；在海诺省土尔内车站的铁路工人中，占百分之九十点七；在海诺省沙勒尔瓦第六号矿坑的工人中，占百分之八十六点一。
