Hunan Province State-Owned Commercial Departments Vigorously Transfer Industrial Products to Rural Areas

The goods listed in the fourth-quarter material supply contracts signed by the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Station of the Hunan Provincial Company of China General Merchandise Company and the state-owned department stores of various counties have been entirely transferred to the stores by the end of October and the beginning of November. These goods are all materials suitable for the needs of farmers, such as flannel shirts, gauze socks, rubber shoes, and bamboo-shell thermos bottles. By November 10th, over 80% of the fabrics supplied in November by the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth stores of various counties had been transferred. Most of the fabrics are suitable for the needs of farmers, such as red and blue cloth, fancy serge, men's and women's factory tweed, twill, and dark-colored printed cloth. In order to ensure that goods can be transferred to rural areas in a timely manner to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, the staff of the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Station of the General Merchandise Company and the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, especially the personnel in the storage and transportation departments, have been working diligently day and night, coming up with many methods for quick transfer and transportation. For example, they have adopted the direct allocation method, where goods are directly allocated to county stores as soon as they arrive at the station, and the factory acceptance method. For example, for goods that should be allocated to Changsha City Department Store by the Changsha Supply Station of the General Merchandise Company, the Supply Station sends personnel to the processing factory for acceptance, and the goods are immediately transferred directly from the factory to Changsha City Department Store, simplifying the procedures of warehousing and delivery, so that the goods can quickly meet consumers. In the past, only 30% of the goods allocated by the Changsha Wholesale Station of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to various places were directly transferred. In early November, this has increased to 59%.

In order to further meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, in addition to transferring goods suitable for rural needs quickly and vigorously, the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Station of the General Merchandise Company has also expanded this year's fourth-quarter processing and procurement plan by 10% and increased the processing of a large number of native cloth. In this year's fourth-quarter processing and procurement, the Changsha Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has expanded the production of Era checkered cloth, People's City cloth, and cashmere cloth, which are particularly popular among farmers. Both stations have sent cadres to the stores in various counties to help them do a good job in expanding purchasing and sales, to meet the needs of the rural market after autumn.

    湖南省国营商业部门大力调运工业品下乡
    中国百货公司湖南省公司长沙采购供应站和各县国营百货商店签订的第四季度物资供应合同中所列的商品，已在十月底和十一月初全部调运各商店。这些货物，都是适合农民需要的物资，如绒衣、夹纱袜、胶鞋、竹壳热水瓶等。花纱布公司长沙采购供应批发站和各县国营花纱布商店签订的十一月份供应的布匹，到十一月十日止，已调出百分之八十以上，大部分布匹都是适合农民需要的。如红蓝布、花哔叽、男女厂呢、斜纹布、深色花布等。为了使货物能够及时调到农村，供应广大农民需要，百货公司长沙采购供应站和花纱布公司长沙采购供应批发站的工作人员，特别是储运部门的人员，他们日夜辛勤地工作着，想出许多快调快运的办法。如采取货到车站即直接拨往各县商店的直拨和厂房验收办法，像百货公司长沙供应站应拨给长沙市百货商店的商品，由供应站派员到加工工厂验收后，马上从厂里直接调往长沙市百货商店，简省了入库、出库的手续，使货物能够很快地和消费者见面。花纱布公司长沙批发站过去拨往各地的商品，直接拨运的只占百分之三十，十一月上旬已增加到百分之五十九。
    为了进一步满足广大农民的需要，百货公司长沙采购供应站除了尽量将适合农村需要的商品迅速大力往下调拨外，同时将今年第四季度的加工采购计划扩大了百分之十，并且增加了大批土布的加工。花纱布公司长沙采购供应批发站在今年第四季度的加工采购中，扩大了农民特别喜爱的时代格子布和人民市布、开士米布等。两个站都已派出干部往各县商店，帮助他们搞好扩大购销的工作，以适应秋后农村市场的需要。
