     Bumper Harvest of Late Autumn Crops in Southern Provinces
    [Our Newspaper] The harvest of late autumn crops in the southern provinces has been fully launched. This year, under the leadership of the Party and the government, farmers in the southern provinces have implemented the spirit of increasing production and saving food from the drought-resistant planting of late autumn crops, waged unremitting struggles against natural disasters, and improved farming techniques and harvesting methods, finally enabling late-harvested crops to achieve good harvests.
    Currently, late autumn crops in Hubei Province have generally achieved bumper harvests, and farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces are harvesting tensely. Farmers in the Changde area of Hunan Province, under the slogan of "returning every grain to the home," adopted meticulous harvesting methods, estimating that they could increase the harvest of late rice by at least three million catties. Farmers in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, proposed the goal of increasing production and saving 8 million catties of rice in the autumn harvest and winter planting, while farmers in Wannian County strived to increase production and save 20 catties of rice per person, and the whole county increased production and saved 2.9 million catties of rice. Late autumn crops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are nearing maturity and are generally growing well. Farmers are continuing to prevent disasters and protect autumn, striving to increase production. Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and other provinces are carefully harvesting late-harvest crops, and the amount of grain harvested has increased significantly. In Jiangsu Province, the harvest of late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes, autumn beans, and late rice has begun, and the Suzhou area requires an increase of 7 to 10 catties per mu; leaders in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas have proposed careful harvesting of sweet potatoes, increasing the harvest by 30 catties per mu. In most parts of Zhejiang Province, the late rice harvest has increased compared to last year, and the quality is also better than in previous years. According to a survey in Shaonan Township, Wuxing County, the average yield of late rice is about 610 catties per mu, with the highest being over 650 catties. Fujian Province has begun harvesting late rice. Pucheng County, one of the main grain-producing areas, has generally had a bumper harvest of late rice. According to the Nanping area, where late rice planting accounts for 85 percent of the rice area, it is estimated that this year's average yield can be increased by about 10 percent. In Yongtai County, the areas that have been harvested have generally increased production; the yield of disaster-stricken fields can also maintain last year's level. Various parts of Anhui Province are mobilizing farmers to improve sweet potato harvesting techniques in an effort to harvest more. In addition, the autumn harvests in Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and other provinces are generally higher than last year. Late rice in Yunnan has already been harvested, and the province's total grain output this year may increase by 3 percent compared to last year. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xikang Province have greatly increased autumn crop production. The unit area yield of autumn crops in the Tibetan Autonomous Region can be increased by 15 percent compared to last year. In Zunyi area and Guiding area of Guizhou Province, which have been harvested, late autumn crops have increased by 8 to 15 percent.
    This year, the vast number of cadres of Party and government organizations at all levels have persistently led the masses to organize to fight drought and plant crops, to fight drought and protect autumn, to improve production technology, and the people's governments at all levels have promptly issued a large number of loans and farm tools to support farmers' production, which has greatly promoted the increase in late autumn crops in the southern provinces this year. In many areas, cadres at all levels took the lead in the struggle with the masses in drought-resistant sowing of late autumn crops, and the sown area was not only not reduced, but also exceeded the past, which greatly avoided the reduction in grain production. For example, the harvests of Yansun rice and late rice, which account for the largest proportion of late autumn crops in Hubei Province this year, are very good. According to statistics from various places in the Huanggang area, Yansun rice has increased by an average of more than 20 percent compared to last year, and in most areas it has increased by one-third. Some advanced mutual aid groups have doubled their production. In many areas of Hubei Province, farmers did not originally have the habit of cultivating late autumn crops. This year, under the strong call and specific assistance of the government, they expanded the planting area of late autumn crops. This year, Wuchang County planted Yansun rice in half of the total fields, and Hanyang planted more than 40,000 mu of late rice than last year. The bumper harvest of late autumn crops in various parts of the province this year not only brought economic benefits to farmers, but also overcame conservative thinking and opened up avenues for expanding the planting of late autumn crops in the future. Some farmers in Huangpi County said that the people's government led us to harvest buckwheat last autumn and Yansun rice this autumn. Only by listening to the people's government can we increase production.

     南方各省晚秋作物丰收
    【本报讯】南方各省晚秋作物的收获工作已经全面展开。今年南方各省农民在党和政府的领导下，从抗旱抢种晚秋作物起，就贯彻了增产节约粮食的精神，对自然灾害进行了不懈的斗争，改进了耕作技术和收获的方法，终于使晚收作物获得了较好的收成。
    目前，湖北省各地晚秋作物已经获得普遍丰收，湖南、江西两省农民正在紧张收割。湖南省常德专区农民在“颗粒还家”的口号下，采用细收细打的办法，估计至少能增加三百万斤晚稻的收获量。江西省永新县农民提出了在秋收、冬种中要增产节约大米八百万斤的目标，万年县农民争取每人增产节约二十斤稻谷，全县增产节约稻谷二百九十万斤。广东、广西两省晚秋作物已近成熟，一般生长良好，农民正在继续防灾保秋，争取增产。江苏、浙江、福建、安徽等省的农民在收获晚收作物时，细收细打，粮食收获量增加很多。江苏省的晚秋作物甘薯、秋豆、晚稻等已开始收获，苏州专区要求每亩多收七斤到十斤；徐州、淮阴地区的领导方面，提出收甘薯时精收细收，每亩多收三十斤。浙江省大部地区晚稻收成比去年增加，质量也比往年好。据吴兴县苕南乡的调查，晚稻平均每亩可产六百一十斤左右，最高的在六百五十斤以上。福建省已经开始收割晚稻。主要产粮地区之一的浦城县，晚稻普遍丰收。据晚稻栽植面积占水稻面积百分之八十五的南平专区估计，今年可平均增产一成左右。该省永泰县已收割的地区，一般都增产；受灾田产量也能维持去年水平。安徽省各地正发动农民改进收甘薯的技术，争取多收。此外，云南、贵州、西康等省秋田收成一般都较去年增产。云南晚稻已经在收割，该省今年粮食总产量可比去年增加百分之三。西康省各族农民秋季作物都大大增产。藏族自治区秋庄稼的单位面积产量可比去年提高百分之十五。贵州省已收割的遵义专区和贵定专区，晚秋作物都增产百分之八到百分之十五。
    今年，党和政府各级组织的广大干部，坚持不懈地领导群众组织起来抗旱抢种，抗旱保秋，改进生产技术，以及各级人民政府及时贷发大量贷款和农具，扶植农民生产，对今年南方各省晚秋作物的增产，起了巨大推动作用。许多地区的各级干部，在抗旱播种晚秋作物中，带领群众积极斗争，播种面积不但没有减少，而且还超过了往年，这就大大避免了粮食的减产。如湖北省今年在晚秋作物中占比重最大的秧荪谷和晚稻，收成都很好。据黄冈专区各地统计，今年秧荪比去年平均增产二成以上，大部地区增产三分之一。某些先进的互助组增产达到一倍。湖北省不少地区的农民，过去本来没有培育晚秋作物的习惯，今年在政府大力号召和具体帮助下，扩大了晚秋作物的种植面积，武昌县今年蓄秧荪的达总田亩的一半，汉阳今年插晚稻的面积，比去年扩大四万多亩。今年该省各地晚秋作物的丰收，不但使农民得到了经济利益，而且克服了保守思想，为今后扩大种植晚秋作物开辟了道路。黄陂县有的农民就说，人民政府去年秋天领导我们收荞麦，今年秋天领导我们收秧荪，只有听人民政府的话才能得到增产。
