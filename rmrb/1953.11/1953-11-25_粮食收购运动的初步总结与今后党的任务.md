(To all levels of organizations of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks))

Editor's Note: The original text of this article by Comrade Stalin was first published on February 13, 1928, and later included in Volume 11 of Stalin's Collected Works. For general background information on this article, please refer to the article "How the Difficulties of Grain Procurement in the Early Stage of Soviet Industrialization Were Overcome" published on page 3 of this newspaper on November 4th of this year.

A month and a half ago, that is, at the beginning of January 1928, we had a very serious crisis in grain procurement. As of the beginning of January 1927, we had procured a total of 428 million poods of grain, while as of the beginning of January 1928, the procured grain barely reached 300 million poods. Therefore, comparing the beginning of January 1928 with the beginning of January 1927, we were short by 128 million poods of grain. This shortfall is the approximate numerical representation of the grain procurement crisis.

What does the grain procurement crisis indicate? What is its significance and what are the possible consequences?

First, it indicates a supply crisis in the workers' areas, rising grain prices in these areas, and a decline in the real wages of workers.

Second, it indicates a crisis in the supply of the Red Army, creating discontent within the Red Army.

Third, it indicates a supply crisis in hemp and cotton planting areas, with speculative grain prices appearing in these areas, leading cotton and hemp farmers to switch to grain cultivation; consequently, cotton and hemp production shrinks, and the related textile industry sectors also shrink.

Fourth, it indicates that the state lacks grain reserves to meet domestic needs (in case of poor harvests) and to meet the export needs necessary for importing equipment and agricultural machinery.

Finally, it indicates that our entire price policy is being undermined, the policy of stabilizing grain prices is being undermined, and the policy of continuously reducing industrial product prices is being undermined.

In order to get rid of these difficulties, it is necessary to make up for the losses and eliminate the deficit of 128 million poods in grain procurement. To eliminate this deficit, all the levers of the Party and the government must be put into motion, break the stagnant state in various organizations, throw the Party's best forces from top to bottom into the front line of grain procurement, and make full use of the short period before the muddy season arrives to strengthen grain procurement work at all costs.

It was precisely for this purpose that the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued the first two grain purchase instructions (the first issued on December 14, 1927, and the second issued on December 24, 1927). However, because these two instructions did not take effect, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) had to issue a third instruction on January 6, 1928, which was unprecedented in terms of its tone and requirements. The ending of the instruction stated that if the leaders of the Party organizations could not completely reverse the status quo of grain procurement work in the shortest period, then tough measures would be taken against them. Obviously, such tough measures can only be used in special circumstances, and the secretaries of the Party organizations are not working for official business but for revolutionary work. However, the Central Committee, based on the above-mentioned special circumstances, considered it appropriate to take this step.

There are many reasons for the grain procurement crisis, but the following reasons must be pointed out:

First, the countryside is developing and becoming wealthier. The rich peasants developed and became wealthy first. Three years of good harvests have played their part. This year's surplus grain is no less than last year's, just as this year's industrial products are no less than last year's but more than last year's. However, the wealthy class in the countryside can now rely on cash crops, livestock products, etc. to circulate, and hoard grain in order to raise grain prices. Of course, it cannot be assumed that the rich peasants are the main holders of grain, but they are the economic authority in the countryside, and they are in collusion with urban speculators who are willing to pay higher grain prices. As long as they do not encounter obstruction from our grain procurement organs, they may be able to make the middle peasants follow them in raising grain prices and undermining the Soviet price policy.

Second, our grain procurement organs failed to fulfill their mission. They abused methods such as price suppression and various "legal" surcharges, and instead of subduing speculators, they desperately competed with each other, destroying the united front of grain procurement organs, raising grain prices, unconsciously helping speculators and rich peasants to undermine the Soviet price policy, worsening the market, and reducing procurement work. True, the Party can intervene and eliminate these shortcomings. However, the Party, intoxicated by the achievements of last year's grain procurement and busy with arguments [1], let go of these shortcomings, thinking that all shortcomings would be overcome naturally. Moreover, many Party organizations treated grain procurement work formalistically, as if this work had nothing to do with them, forgetting that the working class's responsibility for the shortcomings in grain procurement work, as well as for the shortcomings in all economic and cooperative organizational work, rests first and foremost on the Party.

Third, our rural work line has been distorted in many areas. The Party's basic slogan of "relying on the poor peasants, establishing a solid alliance with the middle peasants, and never stopping the struggle against the rich peasants" is often not implemented correctly. Party organizations at all levels have learned to form alliances with the middle peasants, which is a great achievement of the Party, but these organizations are far from doing a good job in working with the poor peasants in various places. As for the struggle against the rich peasants and the rich peasant danger, our Party organizations have also not done everything they should have done in this regard. This is mainly because in our organizations, whether Party or other organizations, some Party dissidents have recently appeared who do not see classes in the countryside, do not understand the basis of our class policy, and attempt to carry out work in this way: not offending anyone in the countryside, living in peace with the rich peasants, and maintaining prestige among "all strata" in the countryside. Obviously, such "Communists" in the countryside cannot improve our rural work, cannot limit the exploitation tendencies of the rich peasants, and cannot unite the poor peasants around the Party.

Furthermore, by January, the purchasing power of peasants had increased greatly compared with last year due to increased income from non-grain crops, animal husbandry, and working outside, while the quantity of industrial products transported to the countryside had increased, but the supply of goods had decreased somewhat in value, that is to say, the supply of goods lagged behind the increase in purchasing power.

All this, combined with some errors in our work (such as the slow transportation of industrial products to the countryside, insufficient agricultural tax collection, and the inability to absorb rural idle funds, etc.), created the conditions that led to the grain procurement crisis.

It goes without saying that the Central Committee, not just the Party's local organizations at all levels, should be primarily responsible for these errors.

To overcome the crisis, it is first necessary to mobilize Party organizations at all levels and tell them that grain procurement work is a matter for the whole Party.

Second, it is necessary to curb speculation and normalize the market by cracking down on speculators and rich peasant speculators, and to this end, it is necessary to utilize the Soviet laws that deal with speculation in essential goods.

Third, it is necessary to use the laws on apportionment, peasant bonds, and the prohibition of private brewing to absorb rural idle funds.

Fourth, it is necessary to subject our grain procurement organs to the control of the Party organizations, force them to stop competing with each other, and order them to implement the Soviet price policy.

Finally, it is necessary to prevent the Party's line from being distorted in practical rural work, to take the task of fighting against the rich peasant danger as the focus of work, and to order our Party organizations to "continue the offensive against the rich peasants" (see the Fifteenth Party Congress's decision "On Rural Work") [2].

As can be seen from the instructions of the Central Committee, the Party has taken these measures in the struggle to strengthen grain procurement work and has launched a corresponding movement throughout the country.

Under other conditions and circumstances, the Party may have taken other forms of struggle, such as throwing tens of millions of poods of grain into the market to trap the wealthy classes in the countryside who were unwilling to put grain on the market. But for this, the state would have to have sufficient grain reserves, or sufficient foreign exchange reserves to import tens of millions of poods of grain from abroad. However, everyone knows that the state does not have these reserves. Precisely because it does not have these reserves, the Party is faced with the very measures mentioned in the instructions of the Central Committee, which have been manifested in the launched grain procurement movement, most of which measures can only be effective during this year's grain procurement period.

Some say that we seem to be abolishing the New Economic Policy, implementing the surplus grain collection system, and expropriating the property of rich peasants, etc. This is counter-revolutionary nonsense that must be resolutely combated. The New Economic Policy is the foundation of our economic policy and will not change for a considerable historical period. The New Economic Policy means commodity circulation, means allowing capitalism to exist under the condition that the state has the right and possibility to adjust commerce from the perspective of the proletarian dictatorship. Otherwise, the New Economic Policy would be simply a restoration of capitalism, which is something that the counter-revolutionary rumor-mongers who talk about abolishing the New Economic Policy are unwilling to understand.

Now, we have sufficient reason to conclude that the measures we have taken and the grain procurement movement we have launched have won the Party its first decisive victory. The speed of grain procurement in various places has increased sharply. The amount of grain procured in January was double that of December. The speed of grain procurement in February has increased again. The grain procurement movement is a check on all our organizations, whether Party, Soviet, or cooperative, and it helps these organs to eliminate degenerate elements and promote new revolutionary workers. The shortcomings in the work of the grain procurement organs have been exposed, and methods to correct these shortcomings have been formulated in the process of the grain procurement movement. The Party's rural work has been improved and is lively, and the phenomenon of distorting the Party's line has been overcome. The influence of the rich peasants in the countryside is being weakened, work with the poor peasants is becoming more active, the staff of the rural Soviets is being strengthened, and the prestige of the Soviet government is being enhanced among the basic masses of peasants (including the middle peasants).

We are clearly getting rid of the grain procurement crisis.

However, in addition to the above-mentioned achievements obtained in practically implementing the Party's instructions, there are still many distortions and excesses, which, if not overcome, will create new difficulties. These distortions and excesses include attempts by individual regions to adopt direct commodity exchange, compulsory promotion of agricultural bonds, the establishment of organizations similar to patrol teams, and indiscriminate arrests and illegal confiscation of surplus grain, etc.

All these phenomena must be resolutely eliminated. In addition to further strengthening the work of various organs to ensure the full completion of the grain procurement plan, the Central Committee also orders the local Party and Soviet organs at all levels to immediately start preparing for the spring plowing movement and ensure that the area of spring sowing can be expanded.

A united, friendly, and organized movement to expand the sown area, with special support from collective farms, should be launched among the poor and middle peasants in the countryside to counter the agitation by individual rich peasant speculators to reduce the sown area.

Based on the above, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) recommends:

(1) Not to relax and continue to strengthen the grain procurement movement, and to complete the annual grain procurement plan at all costs.

(2) To step up the struggle against all direct or indirect ways of raising publicly agreed prices.

(3) Resolutely eliminate the competition between state and cooperative grain procurement organs, and truly ensure the united front of procurement organs in the struggle against speculators and profiteers who raise grain prices and rich peasants.

(4) Continue to exert pressure on the rich peasants, that is, on those who truly hold surplus marketable grain, but to implement it entirely in accordance with Soviet law (among them, individual saboteurs among the rich peasants who own two thousand poods or more of surplus marketable grain should be dealt with in accordance with Article 107 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the corresponding provisions in Ukrainian law), and never use these or similar methods to infringe on the middle peasants.

(5) From the surplus grain legally confiscated from speculators and rich peasant speculators, set aside 25 percent to meet the needs of poor peasants for seeds in the form of long-term credit, and if necessary, also meet their consumption needs.

(6) Resolutely eliminate the distortions and excesses that have occurred in the practical work of strengthening the grain procurement movement, which in individual cases have developed into the use of methods of collecting surplus grain, such as collecting grain from house to house, setting up search teams between individual regions, etc.

(7) When dealing with farmers' arrears to the state (arrears of agricultural tax, insurance premiums, loans, etc.), continue to exert pressure on the wealthy classes in the countryside, especially on the rich peasant class, and take measures to reduce or give preferential treatment to the poor peasants, and if necessary, also to the poor middle peasants.

(8) In terms of apportionment, adopt a progressive rate higher than the agricultural tax for the rich peasants and the wealthy classes in the countryside. Ensure that the poor classes in the countryside are exempted from apportionment, and that the poor middle peasants and the families of Red Army soldiers are given reduced apportionment. When launching the apportionment movement in various places, give play to the spontaneous spirit of society and widely absorb poor peasants, Communist Youth League members, women representatives, and rural intellectuals to participate in this work. The funds obtained from the apportionment should be strictly earmarked for special purposes and should not be misappropriated for institutional expenses. The items to be used, the expenditure budget, etc., should be specifically discussed and approved at the peasants' congress, and the use of the funds should be subject to the supervision of the general public.

(9) Resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of promoting peasant bonds through administrative means (buying grain with bonds, forcibly distributing bonds from house to house, etc.), concentrate on explaining to the peasants the benefits of peasant bonds to them, and use the influence and strength of social organizations in the countryside to promote peasant bonds among the wealthy classes in the countryside.

(10) Do not weaken attention to meeting the needs of grain procurement areas for industrial products. Eliminate the direct and indirect ways of exchanging grain and industrial products that have already appeared. In special circumstances, for commodities that are in extremely short supply, the method of giving preferential treatment to cooperative members can be extended to peasants who have not joined the cooperative, as long as they are willing to sell grain.

(11) In the process of procuring grain, continue to check work, and resolutely cleanse the Party, Soviet, and cooperative organizations, expel dissidents and bad elements who have infiltrated, and replace them with firm Party members and vetted non-Party workers.

    粮食收购运动的初步总结与今后党的任务
    斯大林
    （给联共（布）各级组织）
    编者按：斯大林同志所作的这篇文章的原文第一次刊印于一九二八年二月十三日，后来收在斯大林全集第十一卷中。关于这篇文章的一般背景，请读者参看本年十一月四日本报第三版发表的“苏联工业化初期的粮食收购困难是怎样克服的”一文。
    一个半月以前，即一九二八年一月初，我们在粮食收购方面有了极严重的危机。截至一九二七年一月初为止，我们共收购了四亿二千八百万普特粮食，而截至一九二八年一月初为止，收购的粮食勉强达到三亿普特。所以，拿一九二八年一月初和一九二七年一月初比较，我们少了一亿二千八百万普特粮食。这个缺额也就是粮食收购危机的概约的数字表现。
    粮食收购危机表明什么呢？它的意义和可能产生的后果如何呢？
    首先表明工人区发生了供应危机，这些地区的粮价上涨，工人的实际工资下降。
    第二表明红军的供应发生了危机，红军中产生了不满情绪。
    第三表明种麻和植棉区的供应发生了危机，这些地区出现了投机的粮价，棉农和麻农改种粮食；因而棉、麻生产缩小，有关的纺织工业部门也随之缩小。
    第四表明国家手中缺乏粮食储备，不能满足国内需要（逢歉收时），也不能满足为输入装备和农业机器所必需的出口需要。
    最后表明我们的整个价格政策遭受破坏，稳定粮价的政策遭受破坏，不断减低工业品价格的政策遭受破坏。
    为了摆脱这些困难，就应当弥补损失并消灭粮食收购上达一亿二千八百万普特的赤字。要消灭这个赤字，就应当使党和政府的一切杠杆动作起来，打破各组织中的死气沉沉的状态，把党的优秀力量自上而下地投到收购粮食的战线上去，充分利用泥泞时期到来之前一段短时期，无论如何要加强粮食收购工作。
    正是为了这种目的，联共（布）中央发出了头两个购粮指示（第一个在一九二七年十二月十四日发出，第二个在一九二七年十二月二十四日发出）。但因为这两个指示没有发生效力，联共（布）中央不得不在一九二八年一月六日又发出第三个指示，这个指示不论按其语气或要求来说，都是绝无仅有的。指示的结尾提出，如果党组织的领导者在最短期间不能彻底扭转粮食收购工作的现状，那末就要对他们采取强硬手段。显然，这种强硬手段只能在特殊情况下运用，况且，党组织的书记们并不是为公务工作而是为革命工作的。可是，中央由上述特殊情况出发，认为采取这一步骤是适当的。
    引起粮食收购危机的原因有很多，但必须指出下列几个原因：
    第一，农村是在发展并富裕起来。富农首先发展了，富起来了。三年的丰收是有其作用的。今年的余粮不比去年少，正如今年国内工业品也不比去年少而比去年多一样。可是农村富裕阶层今年已可依靠原料作物、肉类产品等等实行周转，而囤下粮食以便抬高粮价。诚然，不能认为富农是粮食的主要持有者，但他们是农村中的经济权威，他们和肯出较高粮价的城市投机商有勾结，只要不遇到我们粮食收购机关的阻挠，他们就有可能在抬高粮价的问题上，在破坏苏维埃的价格政策的问题上使中农跟着他们走。
    第二，我们的粮食收购机关未能完成自己的使命。它们滥用压价和各种“依法”加价的办法，它们不去制服投机商，反而互相拚命竞争，破坏了粮食收购机关的统一战线，使粮价上涨，不自觉地帮助了投机商和富农去破坏苏维埃的价格政策，使市场恶化并降低了收购工作。诚然，党是可以实行干涉而消灭这些缺点的。但是党为去年粮食收购的成绩所陶醉，同时又忙于争论〔一〕，于是放过了这些缺点，以为一切缺点自然而然就会克服的。而且，有许多党组织形式主义地对待粮食收购工作，好像这个工作与它们无关，忘记工人阶级对粮食收购工作中的缺点，以及对一切经济的与合作社的组织工作中的缺点所负的责任，首先是担在党的身上。
    第三，我们的农村工作路线在许多地区被歪曲了。“依靠贫农，和中农建立巩固的联盟，一分钟也不要停止对富农的斗争”这个党的基本口号，往往执行得不正确。各级党组织已经学会了和中农结成联盟，这是党的一个巨大成绩，但是这些组织还远没有把各地的贫农工作做好。至于说到同富农和富农危险作斗争，那末，我们的党组织在这方面也远没有作到它们所应作的一切。就中这是因为，在我们各组织中，不论是党的或其他的组织中，最近出现了一些党的异已分子，他们看不见农村中有阶级，不懂得我们阶级政策的基础，企图这样来进行工作：在农村中谁也不去得罪，同富农和平共居，在农村“各个阶层”中都保持声望。显然，在农村中有这种“共产党员”是不能改善我们的农村工作，不能限制富农的剥削趋向，也不能把贫农团结在党的周围的。
    其次，到正月时，农民的购买力因非谷类农作物、畜牧、外出干活等收入增加而较去年大为提高，同时运往农村的工业品数量虽然已经增加，但商品的供应在价值上却有些减少，也就是说，商品的供应落后于购买力的提高。
    这一切，和我们工作中的一些错误（如工业品运至农村迟缓、农业税征收不足、不善于吸收农村游资等等）结合起来，就造成了引起粮食收购危机的条件。
    不言而喻，应对这些错误负责的首先是中央委员会，而不仅是党的各级地方组织。
    为了克服危机，首先必须使各级党组织行动起来，告诉它们粮食收购工作是全党的事情。
    第二，用打击投机商和富农投机分子的办法来制止投机活动并使市场正常起来，为此必须利用那些对付必需品的投机的苏维埃法律。
    第三，必须利用关于摊派、农民公债和禁止酿造私酒的法律来吸收农村游资。
    第四，必须使我们的粮食收购机关受党组织的控制，迫使它们停止互相竞争，责成它们执行苏维埃的价格政策。
    最后，必须使党的路线在农村实际工作中不再受到歪曲，把对富农危险作斗争的任务当作工作重点，责成我们的党组织“继续向富农进攻”（见第十五次党代表大会“关于农村工作”的决定）〔二〕
    从中央委员会的指示中可以知道，党在加强粮食收购工作的斗争中，正是采取了这样一些措施，并在全国开展了相应的运动。
    在另外的条件和情况下，党也许会采取其他的斗争方式，譬如把几千万普特粮食抛到市场上去，以此困住农村中不肯拿粮上市的富裕阶层。但是为此国家手中就要有足够的粮食储备，或者有充分的外汇储备，以便从外国输入几千万普特粮食。但是，大家知道，国家没有这些储备。正因为没有这些储备，摆在党面前的就是中央委员会指示中所说的那些非常措施，这些措施已在开展了的粮食收购运动中表现出来，其中大部措施只能在今年收购粮食的时期内有效。
    有人说我们好像在废除新经济政策、实行余粮收集制和剥夺富农财产等等，这是反革命的胡说，必须与之进行坚决的斗争。新经济政策是我们经济政策的基础，在相当长的历史时期中不会改变。新经济政策意味着商品流通，意味着在国家有权和有可能以无产阶级专政的观点调整商业的情况下允许资本主义存在。否则，新经济政策就会是单纯地恢复资本主义，这一点是大谈废除新经济政策的反革命造谣者所不愿意了解的。
    现在，我们有充分的理由可以断定，我们采取的措施和开展的粮食收购运动，已经给党赢得了首次决定性的胜利。各地收购粮食的速度已猛然提高。一月份收购的粮食比十二月份增加了一倍。二月份收购粮食的速度又有所提高。粮食收购运动对于我们所有的组织，不论是党的、苏维埃的或合作社的，都是一次检查，它帮助这些机关清除蜕化分子，提拔新的革命工作人员。各粮食收购机关工作中的缺点已暴露出来，并在粮食收购运动的进程中制定了纠正这些缺点的办法。党的农村工作已在改进和有生气，歪曲党的路线的现象已在克服。富农在农村中的影响正在削弱，贫农工作日趋活跃，农村苏维埃的工作人员正在加强，苏维埃政府在农民基本群众（包括中农）中的威信正在提高。
    我们显然正在摆脱粮食收购的危机。
    但是，除了在实际工作中执行党的指示所得到的上述成绩外，还有许多歪曲和过火行为，如不加以克服就会造成新的困难。这些歪曲和过火行为就是个别地区企图采取直接的商品交换，强迫推销农业公债，建立类似巡查队的组织，以及滥肆捕人，非法没收余粮等等。
    所有这些现象必须坚决消灭。除了进一步加强各机关的工作以使粮食收购计划全部完成外，中央委员会并责成各级地方党组织和苏维埃机关立即着手进行春耕运动的准备工作，保证能扩大春耕播种面积。
    应当在农村贫苦阶层和中农中间展开一个团结的、友好的、有组织的、得到集体农庄特别支持的扩大播种面积的运动，来对抗个别富农投机分子关于缩小播种面积的鼓动。
    根据上述情况，联共（布）中央委员会建议：
    （一）毫不放松并继续加强粮食收购运动，无论如何要完成全年的粮食收购计划。
    （二）加紧和一切直接或间接提高公议价格的方式作斗争。
    （三）坚决消除国家和合作社粮食收购机关之间的竞争，在同投机倒把抬高粮价的收买商和富农进行斗争时，真正保证收购机关的统一战线。
    （四）继续对富农，即对那些真正持有剩余的商品粮的大户施以压力，但要完全根据苏维埃法律来执行（其中，对拥有两千普特或更多剩余商品粮的富农中的个别蓄意破坏分子，应依照俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第一百零七条以及乌克兰法律中相当的条款处理），千万不要用这些或类似的办法来侵犯中农。
    （五）从依法没收的投机商和富农投机分子的余粮中，抽出百分之二五以长期信贷方式去满足贫农对种子的需要，必要时也满足他们的消费需要。
    （六）坚决取缔在加紧粮食收购运动的实际工作中发生的歪曲和过火行为，在个别情况下这种行为曾发展为采用征收余粮的方法，如挨户征收粮食，在个别地区之间设搜查队等等。
    （七）在处理农民拖欠国家款项时（欠农业税、保险费、贷款等），继续对农村富裕阶层施以压力，特别是对富农阶层施以压力，对贫农，必要时也对贫苦中农，则采取减轻或优待的办法。
    （八）在摊派方面，对富农和农村富裕阶层采用较农业税为高的累进率。保证对农村贫苦阶层免除摊派，对贫苦中农和红军家属减轻摊派。在各地开展摊派运动时，要发挥社会的自动精神，广泛吸收贫农、共产主义青年团员、妇女代表和农村知识分子参加这一工作。对摊派得来的款项应严格实行专款专用，不许挪作机关经费，要在农民大会上具体讨论和批准动用的事项、支出预算等等，款项的使用并要受广大公众的监督。
    （九）坚决取缔用行政手段推销农民公债的现象（用公债券买粮食，挨户强行分配公债等等），集中注意力向农民解释农民公债对他们的好处，并利用农村中社会团体的影响和力量在农村富裕阶层中推销农民公债券。
    （十）在满足粮食收购区对工业品的需要方面，不要削弱注意力。取缔已经出现的粮食和工业品交换的直接和间接方式，在特殊情况下，对于奇缺的商品，可以把优待合作社社员的办法扩大到未参加合作社的农民，只要他们肯出卖粮食。
    （十一）在收购粮食的进程中，继续检查工作，并坚决清洗党、苏维埃和合作社的组织，驱逐异己分子和混进来的坏分子，以坚定的党员和经过审查的非党工作人员代替他们。
