Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 25th: The huge rolling machine of the newly built large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company began to operate at about 7:00 p.m. on the 24th. The head of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the general manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the chief Soviet expert advisor all went to the site to guide the trial operation of the rolling machine. When the rolling machine started to rotate safely, people were excited and encouraged by the rotation of this large and complex machine. Zhu Julang, an old worker who was promoted to technician, had endless joy. Last winter, in this severe cold season, he, with the help of Soviet experts, led the workers to sweep snow and install this machine. Now, this giant rolling machine will roll a large amount of steel urgently needed for the construction of our great motherland. That night, he could not suppress his excitement and worked until 2:00 a.m., sometimes measuring the temperature of the large gear box, sometimes listening to the rotation of the rolling machine, and never left the machine. When others persuaded him to rest, he only closed his eyes for a while, and at 4:00 a.m. he ran to the rolling mill to see the rotation of the machine again. The love for machines of many workers like Zhu Julang is understandable, because the rolling machine is the key to the entire factory. Starting the large rolling mill one day ahead of schedule is equivalent to more than 10,000 tons of grain in its total output value.
    The rolling machine rotated continuously from slow to fast for more than ten hours, and the situation was very good. On the morning of the 25th, the director of the large rolling mill, the manager of the mechanical installation engineering company, and Soviet experts signed the "technical completion" handover form. Now, 90 percent of the mechanical and electrical equipment of the large rolling mill has been technically completed, and the trial run and acceptance work is nearing completion, and the comprehensive large-scale trial run will begin soon.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂轧钢机运转情况非常好
    【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂的巨大轧钢机在二十四日下午七时许开始转动了。中共鞍山市委会负责人、鞍山钢铁公司总经理和苏联专家总顾问等都到现场指导轧钢机的试运转工作。当轧钢机开始安全地转动时，人们都为这一很大的复杂的机器的转动而兴奋鼓舞。由老工人提升为技师的朱菊良更有说不尽的欢乐。去年冬天，在这严寒的季节，他在苏联专家的帮助下，一面领导工人扫雪，一面安装了这部机器。现在，这座巨型的轧钢机，就将轧制为建设我们伟大祖国所急需的大批钢材了。这一夜，他按捺不住兴奋的感情，一直工作到深夜两点钟，一忽儿量一量大齿轮箱的温度，一忽儿又到轧钢机旁听一听转动的情况，从没有离开过机器。当别人劝他去休息时，他只闭了一会眼睛，到四点多钟又跑到轧钢机房来看机器的转动了。像朱菊良一样的许多工人热爱机器的心情是可以理解的，因为轧钢机是整个工厂的关键。大型轧钢厂提前开工一天，它的生产总值相等于一万多吨粮食。
    轧钢机由慢到快连续转动了十多个钟头，情况非常良好。二十五日上午，大型轧钢厂厂长、机械安装工程公司经理和苏联专家在“技术竣工”的交工单上签了字。现在，大型轧钢厂百分之九十的机械和电气设备已经技术竣工，试车和验收工作也已接近尾声，全面大试车就将开始了。
