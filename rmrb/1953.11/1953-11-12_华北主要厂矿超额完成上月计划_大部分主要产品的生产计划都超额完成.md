Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: In the second month of the full-scale unfolding of the increased production and conservation movement, eighty state-owned and local state-owned major factories and mines in the North China region continued to exceed the state production plan for October. The production plans for sixteen of the twenty major products of various state-owned factories and mines, such as electricity, coal, steel, pig iron, yarn, and cloth, were exceeded.

    In the increased production and conservation competition, the staff and workers of various factories and mines actively implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, thereby improving labor efficiency. Seventy-two of the one hundred and twenty-eight suggestions recently put forward by Soviet experts to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have been implemented. After the Iron Smelting Department implemented the "layered charging method," the daily output of Blast Furnace No. 1 increased by 20%; after the Steel Smelting Department implemented "in-furnace blowing," the open-hearth smelting time was reduced from eight hours to six hours and forty-two minutes. The Taiyuan Machine Factory promoted the Kolesov turning tool method, which doubled cutting efficiency. Technical personnel and workers in the Rolling Mill Department of Tangshan Steel Plant adjusted and modified the encircling disk, improving work efficiency and enabling the completion of the entire month's production plan four days ahead of schedule.

    In mid-October, personnel from the departments and offices of various factories and mines also actively participated in the increased production and conservation competition. They took the initiative to cooperate with the production workshops, promptly checked the implementation of technical measures, and promptly solved the problems of new weak links arising from the competition. After Tangshan Steel Plant promoted new operating methods and expanded the furnace chamber in the steel-making competition, the output increased, and the demand for raw materials also increased accordingly. The scheduling personnel and material personnel in the plant's functional departments studied and formulated a "scheduled material delivery method" to supply materials in a timely manner. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory had many rework activities in the flywheel section, so the factory organized technical personnel and office cadres to help the flywheel section workers overcome production difficulties. Later, sixteen apprentices in the flywheel section created new records, bringing production up to the needs of other units.

    The Chinese Communist Party branches in various factories and mines played a significant role in completing the state plan. In some factories and mines in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places, Party members, under the leadership of the branch, formulated plans to unite the masses to complete production tasks. In Tianjin, among the one thousand four hundred and seventeen Party members in twelve units who formulated individual plans, one thousand two hundred and twelve completed their plans. Among the two hundred and sixty-seven Party members in the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau who formulated plans, two hundred and forty-one completed their plans.

    华北主要厂矿超额完成上月计划
    大部分主要产品的生产计划都超额完成
    【新华社十一日讯】增产节约运动全面展开的第二个月，华北区有八十个国营和地方国营的主要厂矿，又继续超额完成了十月份的国家生产计划。各国营厂矿的电、煤、钢、生铁、纱、布等二十种主要产品的生产计划有十六种超额完成。
    各厂矿职工在增产节约竞赛中积极执行了苏联专家的建议，提高了劳动效率。苏联专家最近对太原钢铁厂所提的一百二十八件建议，已执行了七十二件。该厂炼铁部实行“分层装料法”后，一号高炉日产量提高了百分之二十；炼钢部实行“炉内吹风”后，平炉冶炼时间由八小时降到六小时四十二分。太原机器厂推行科列索夫车刀法，切削效率提高了一倍。唐山钢厂轧钢部技术人员与工人调整修改了围盘，提高了工作效率，使全月生产计划提前四天完成。
    十月中，各厂矿科、室人员也积极参加了增产节约竞赛。他们主动和生产车间配合，及时检查技术措施的执行，及时解决因竞赛而产生的新的薄弱环节的问题。唐山钢厂在炼钢竞赛中推行新的操作方法和扩大炉膛后，产量提高，原材料需用量也随着增加。该厂职能部门中的调度人员和材料人员研究制订了“定时送料法”，及时供应了材料。天津自行车厂飞轮班退修活多，该厂就组织技术人员和科室干部帮助飞轮班工人克服生产中的困难。以后，飞轮班有十六个徒工创造了新纪录，使生产赶上了其他单位的需要。
    各厂矿中的中国共产党支部在完成国家计划中起了很大作用。北京、天津、唐山等地有些厂矿的党员在支部领导下，订立了团结群众完成生产任务的计划。天津有十二个单位的一千四百十七个订个人计划的党员，就有一千二百十二个完成了计划。京西矿务局城子矿订出计划的二百六十七个党员中，也有二百四十一个完成了计划。
