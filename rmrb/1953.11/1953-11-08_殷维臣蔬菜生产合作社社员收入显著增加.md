Members of the Yin Weichen Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing saw a significant increase in their income. A trial distribution was conducted at the end of September this year. The cooperative's distribution principle is "more work, more gain," and "payment according to labor," ensuring increased income for members and fair and reasonable distribution. The general calculation method is to deduct this year's investment in agricultural and sideline production, public grain, and property depreciation/amortization from the total annual income, and then deduct the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund from the net income. The remaining portion is entirely distributed according to labor days. (Editor's note: Land dividends are not distributed by this cooperative because most of the land is state-owned. Furthermore, vegetable production relies mainly on labor processing and production investment.) According to the trial calculation based on the above method: The cooperative's total agricultural income for the year was 29,675,385 yuan, sideline income was 2,499,179.2 yuan, for a total annual agricultural and sideline income of 32,174,564.2 yuan. After deducting the annual agricultural and sideline investment of 12,580,086.86 yuan and property depreciation/amortization of 6,144,300 yuan, the annual net income was 18,979,265.6 yuan. After further deducting the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund of 9,489,632 yuan (calculated at 5 percent) from the net income, the remaining 18,030,030.14 yuan was entirely distributed according to labor days. The total agricultural and sideline labor points for the entire cooperative were 90,360, with each labor point valued at 1,995.3 yuan. Each labor day was equivalent to 19,953 yuan, which is 53.4 percent higher than the local general agricultural short-term labor wage.

According to the trial calculation results: among the 33 member households in the cooperative, except for one single man whose income decreased by 26 percent due to a long-term illness that prevented him from participating in labor within the cooperative, the income of the remaining 32 households increased compared to last year. Six households saw an increase of 100 percent, eleven households saw an increase of 70 to 90 percent, five households saw an increase of 50 to 70 percent, eight households saw an increase of 20 to 50 percent, and two households saw an increase of 5 to 13 percent.

Generally speaking, the increase in income for poor peasants is greater than that for middle peasants, and the increase for new members is greater than that for old members. This is inevitable. In the past, middle peasants generally had better production conditions than poor peasants, so their income was also higher. After joining the cooperative, the difference in production conditions between middle and poor peasants no longer exists, and income is distributed according to labor. Therefore, when member income generally increases, poor peasants will inevitably increase more than middle peasants. It is also natural that the income of new members increases more than that of old members, because the bases of the two are different. The proportion of income increase for old members is calculated based on the increase that had already occurred last year, while the proportion of income increase for new members is calculated from the basis of individual farming.

The trial calculation results from the Yin Weichen Vegetable Production Cooperative also reveal the following issues:

	I. Production investment. In the distribution, this cooperative only deducts the total production costs for the current year. Seeds, feed, and fodder selected and retained within the cooperative for use next year are not deducted from the total income but are priced and distributed in the same way as other products, becoming part of the members' investment. However, due to the large production costs in vegetable-growing areas, and because some seeds and fine fertilizers must be purchased, the cooperative needs a certain amount of fixed capital. Therefore, it is necessary to collect a certain amount of shares from members based on their labor power (without interest, not refundable upon withdrawal from the cooperative, and not returnable) under the condition that the general members can afford to pay and it does not affect the actual increase in their income. However, the shares should not be too large, and members can be encouraged to invest freely to supplement the shortage of shares.

	II. The issue of compensation for the public property purchased by the cooperative and the depreciated prices of members' livestock and farm tools. The price of the public property newly purchased by the cooperative this year reached 21.5 million yuan, plus 6.87 million yuan that should be repaid to members for the depreciated price of livestock and farm tools, totaling 28.37 million yuan. If all these prices are deducted from the total income, plus the public accumulation fund, then the total amount of public property accumulated this year will reach more than 37 million yuan, and the burden on the members will be too heavy. In order to avoid excessive accumulation of public property and reduce the actual income of members, this part of the price can only be offset by the public accumulation fund and depreciation expenses accumulated this year.

    殷维臣蔬菜生产合作社社员收入显著增加
    北京郊区殷维臣蔬菜生产合作社于今年九月底进行了分配试算。这个社的分配原则是多劳多得，按劳取酬，保证社员增加收入，做到分配的公平合理，总的计算方法是从全年总收入中扣除今年的农副业生产投资、公粮、财产折旧、摊销以后，再从纯收入中扣除公积金、公益金，下余部分全部按劳动日分配。（编者按：这个社的土地不分红，是因为土地大部分是国有的，同时因为蔬菜生产主要靠劳动加工和生产投资。）根据上述办法试算结果：这个社全年农业收入为二万九千六百七十五万三千八百五十元，副业收入为二千四百九十九万一千七百九十二元，总计全年农副业收入为三万二千一百七十四万五千六百四十二元。从中扣除全年农副业投资一万二千五百八十万零八千六百八十六元，财产折旧、摊销六百一十四万四千三百元后，全年纯收入为一万八千九百七十九万二千六百五十六元。再从纯收入中扣除公积金、公益金九百四十八万九千六百三十二元（按百分之五计）后，下余一万八千零三十万零三千零十四元，全部按劳动日分配。全年全社农副业劳动工分共九万零三百六十分，计每一工分分红一千九百九十五点三元，每一劳动日合一万九千九百五十三元，较当地一般农业短工工资高百分之五十三点四。
    根据试算结果：全社三十三户社员中，除一户单身汉因病长期未参加社内劳动，收入减少百分之二十六外，其余三十二户的收入均比去年增加，计增加一倍的六户，增加百分之七十到九十的十一户，增加百分之五十到七十的五户，增加百分之二十到五十的八户，增加百分之五到十三的二户。
    总的来说，社员收入的增加是贫农比中农多，新社员比老社员多，这是必然的。因为中农过去生产条件一般比贫农好，因此收入也比贫农多。入社后中、贫农在生产条件上的差别已经不存在，收入是按劳分配的，故社员收入普遍增加时，贫农必然要比中农多些。新社员收入比旧社员增加的多，也是很自然的。因为二者的基础不同，旧社员收入增加的比例是按去年已经增加的基础上计算的，而新社员收入增加的比例是从单干基础上计算的。
    从殷维臣蔬菜生产合作社试算的结果还可以看出以下几个问题：
    一、生产投资。这个社在分配中只扣除本年度的全部生产费用，对社内选留的来年用的种籽、饲料、饲草，则不从总收入中扣除，而按其他产品同样做价分配，折为社员投资的一部分。但由于菜区生产费用浩大，有些种籽、细肥必须购买，社内正需要有一部分固定资金，因此，必须在一般社员都能缴付而又不影响其实际收入增加的情况下按劳动力缴纳一定的股金（股金不付利息，不退社，不归还）。但股金不宜过多，可以奖励社员自由投资，以补股金之不足。
    二、社内购置的公共财产和社员牲畜农具折价价款的偿付问题。该社今年新购置的公共财产价款达二千一百五十万元，加上今年应还社员牲畜农具折价款六百八十七万元，共达二千八百三十七万元之多。这些价款如全部由总收入中扣除，再加上公积金，那么今年积累的公共财产总数将达三千七百多万元，社员的负担就会过重。为了避免公共财产积累过多，减少社员实际收入，这部分价款只能以今年积累的公积金和折旧费抵还。
