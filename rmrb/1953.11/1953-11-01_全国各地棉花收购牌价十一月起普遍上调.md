Xinhua News Agency, 31st — With November marking the peak season for farmers to sell cotton, the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee has stipulated that, starting November 1st, cotton purchase prices will be universally raised by 3.5% across the country to ensure that farmers who store cotton for later sale do not suffer losses, and even gain a slight profit. The Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have issued a joint directive, deciding to purchase cotton in large quantities after the seasonal price difference for cotton is increased, to meet farmers' demands for selling cotton.

In the first two months after the new cotton entered the market, September and October, cooperatives in various regions mostly implemented the spirit of organizing cotton farmers to sell cotton leisurely and orderly, and basically conducted planned purchases according to national needs. At the same time, according to reports from many regions, although the cotton-grain price ratio in September and October was slightly lower than last year, due to the government's guidance for farmers to improve varieties, and due to the implementation of effective on-site initial inspection and the correction of the shortcomings of cadres responsible for inspection grades applying overly strict grading standards, this year's cotton generally has increased fiber length, and good quality cotton can be sold at a good price. Therefore, the actual income of cotton farmers is not less than last year. During this period, many cotton farmers postponed selling cotton. Cooperatives in many regions absorbed cotton deposits from farmers (to be paid after the seasonal price difference is increased in November), which solved the problem of farmers storing cotton at home and ensured the interests of cotton selling farmers. After September and October, state-owned commercial departments have made full preparations for cotton purchase funds and industrial product supplies. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the cooperative system have expanded their purchase plans for November and December, preparing to purchase in large quantities to fully meet farmers' demands for selling cotton. In order to do a good job in purchasing large quantities of cotton, the Central Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have instructed their subordinate agencies to prepare sufficient cotton purchase funds, simplify and speed up purchase procedures as much as possible to facilitate farmers' cotton sales, and coordinate with relevant departments to fully supply farmers with the means of production and daily necessities urgently needed after selling cotton.

    全国各地棉花收购牌价十一月起普遍上调
   【新华社三十一日讯】农民出售棉花最多季节十一月份已经到来，根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的规定，从十一月一日起，全国各地棉花收购牌价普遍上调百分之三点五，以保证存棉缓售的农民不吃亏，并稍有利。中央人民政府商业部和中华全国合作社联合总社已发出联合指示，决定在棉花季节差价上调以后，大量收购棉花，满足农民售棉的要求。
    新棉上市后的九、十两个月内，各地合作社大多贯彻了组织棉农从容地、有秩序地出售棉花的精神，基本上根据国家需要进行有计划的收购。同时据许多地区反映，九、十月份虽然棉粮比价的幅度较去年略低，但是，由于政府领导农民改良了品种，由于实行产地一次检验有效并纠正了检验等级干部掌握等级偏严的缺点，今年一般棉花都增加了纤维长度，质地良好的棉花都能卖到好价钱，所以，种棉农民的实际收益并不比去年少。在这个时期，很多棉农推迟售棉。很多地区合作社向农民吸收棉花存实（待十一月份季节差价上调后付款），解决了棉农在家存棉的困难，并保证了售棉农民的利益。经过九、十两月份后，国营商业部门对购棉资金及工业品供应都有了充分的准备，中国花纱布公司和合作社系统都已扩大了十一月到十二月份的收购计划，准备大量收购，以充分满足农民的售棉要求。中央商业部和全国合作总社为了做好大量收购棉花的工作，已指示所属各级机构除准备足够的购棉资金外，尽可能简化及加速收购手续，便利农民售棉，并结合有关部门充分供应农民出售棉花后所急需的生产资料和生活资料。
