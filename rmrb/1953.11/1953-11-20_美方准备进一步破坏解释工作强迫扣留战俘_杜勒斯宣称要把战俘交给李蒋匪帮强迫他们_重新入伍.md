Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The US side's conspiracy to sabotage explanatory work and forcibly detain prisoners of war has now taken on new developments. US Secretary of State Dulles held a press conference in Washington on the 17th, declaring that the United States will insist on sending all prisoners of war who have not chosen repatriation by January 22nd next year to the country they have chosen to be "released" as "civilians." Dulles also said that by that time, Korean prisoners of war would be handed over to the Syngman Rhee gang, and Chinese prisoners of war would be handed over to the Kuomintang gang in Taiwan. He also openly stated that these prisoners of war, after being handed over to the Li and Chiang gangs, will have the "right" to "re-enlist." In other words, they will be incorporated into the armies of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang gangs, serving as cannon fodder for the US in its aggressive wars.

On the same day, South Korean Foreign Minister Byun Young-tae also held a press conference. Like his American masters, he claimed that all prisoners of war should be "released" on January 22nd next year, even if the Korean Political Conference has not yet been held by then. He said that otherwise, the prisoners of war should be returned to the side that detained them at the time of the armistice and then "released." He also emphasized that the Indian Custodial Forces should leave the Demilitarized Zone within a few days after January 22nd next year. At the same time, according to Reuters, Kuomintang gang's "ambassador" to South Korea, Wang Dongyuan, visited Byun Young-tae on the 17th to discuss how to forcibly send captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Taiwan at that time.

All these signs indicate that following the sabotage and obstruction of the explanatory work, the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war has undergone further development.

The statements by Dulles and Byun Young-tae fully explain why the US side is now instructing the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gang's special agents to repeatedly obstruct and sabotage the explanatory work, while at the same time doing their utmost to delay the convening of the political conference. According to their plan, as long as they can do everything possible to delay the 90-day period for explaining to prisoners of war, and then delay the 30-day period for the political conference to resolve the prisoner of war issue, and during this period, prevent prisoners of war from having any opportunity to listen to explanations and request repatriation as much as possible, and prevent the political conference from having the opportunity to discuss the prisoner of war issue as much as possible, then, when the 120-day period ends, that is, on January 22nd next year, their conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war can be successfully completed.

Dulles and Byun Young-tae both repeatedly said that they were acting in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, and they clung to the 90-day explanatory period as if they were drowning men clutching at a straw. However, the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the annex to the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the country to which the prisoners of war belong has "freedom and facilities" to explain their repatriation rights to the prisoners of war within 90 days. This naturally does not mean that the days when this "freedom and facilities" do not exist and therefore explanations cannot be carried out should also be counted within the 90 days. If these days are forcibly included in the 90 days, then, apart from this being an attempt to deprive the country to which the prisoners of war belong of the right to conduct explanations and the prisoners of war of the right to listen to explanations and request repatriation, no other explanation is possible. This despicable attempt by Dulles is clearly a complete violation of the spirit of the "Terms of Reference" which "guarantees all prisoners of war the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the ceasefire."

Dulles actually has no respect for the spirit and provisions of the Armistice Agreement. The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the power to interpret the "Terms of Reference," but Dulles does not want to abide by the principle determined by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 25th that the explanatory period should be extended if the start of the explanatory work is delayed. Similarly, the US side is doing its utmost to sabotage the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation 30 days after the political conference discusses the prisoner of war issue "shall be declared by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to be released from their prisoner of war status and become civilians, and then, according to their applications, those who choose to go to a neutral country shall be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Red Cross. This work shall be completed within 30 days. After the completion, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall cease its duties and declare its dissolution." But Dulles and Byun Young-tae are demanding that these prisoners of war be handed over to the US side for "release" on January 22nd next year, not allowing the prisoners of war any opportunity to choose or apply at all, and demanding that the Indian Custodial Forces withdraw immediately. Where is their so-called respect for the Armistice Agreement? It is clear that Dulles does not regard the Armistice Agreement as a solemn international treaty, but only as a piece of waste paper that he can arbitrarily alter. In order to realize the US conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, he can arbitrarily distort, obliterate, and tamper with any of its provisions.

The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that due to the US side's deliberate delay, sabotage and obstruction of the explanatory work, the explanatory work cannot proceed normally. Therefore, in order to protect the repatriation rights of prisoners of war, the explanatory period should be based on the actual time taken. This firm position of the Korean and Chinese side is unwavering. The various appalling atrocities of the US side in forcibly detaining prisoners of war, as accused by the nearly two hundred prisoners of war who have returned home after repatriation before and after the start of the explanatory work, further prove that this proposition of the Korean and Chinese side is fully in line with the spirit of the "Terms of Reference" and humanitarian principles. Dulles's attempt to shorten the explanation time so that the United States will not suffer even more severe political and moral defeats because more prisoners of war demand repatriation is completely futile. The Korean and Chinese side is now closely watching the development of this new conspiracy by the US side.

### 美方准备进一步破坏解释工作强迫扣留战俘  杜勒斯宣称要把战俘交给李蒋匪帮强迫他们“重新入伍”

    美方准备进一步破坏解释工作强迫扣留战俘
    杜勒斯宣称要把战俘交给李蒋匪帮强迫他们“重新入伍”
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的阴谋现在又有了新的发展。美国国务卿杜勒斯十七日在华盛顿举行记者招待会，宣称美国将坚持把所有到明年一月二十二日还没有选择遣返的战俘，送到他们所选择的国家去“释放”为“平民”。杜勒斯并且说，到那时候，朝鲜籍战俘将被交给李承晚匪帮，中国籍战俘将被交给台湾国民党匪帮。他还公然声称，这些战俘在被交给李、蒋匪帮以后，将有“权利”“重新入伍”，换句话说，他们将被编入李承晚和国民党匪帮的军队，充当美国进行侵略战争的炮灰。
    在同一天，南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰也举行了一个记者会，他和他的美国主子一样声称应在明年一月二十二日将一切战俘“释放”，即使那时朝鲜政治会议还没有举行。他说，否则的话，应该把战俘重新交给停战时拘留他们的一方然后再予以“释放”。他还强调在明年一月二十二日以后几天内，印度看管部队应该离开非军事区。同时，据路透社报道，国民党匪帮驻南朝鲜“大使”王东原在十七日访问卞荣泰，讨论到那时候如何把中国人民志愿军被俘人员强迫送往台湾的问题。
    这一切迹象说明，继破坏和阻挠解释工作以后，美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋已有了进一步的发展。
    杜勒斯和卞荣泰的声明，充分说明了为什么美方现在要指使李承晚、蒋介石匪帮特务一再阻挠和破坏解释工作，同时竭力拖延政治会议的召开。按照他们的打算，只要能想尽一切办法拖过对战俘进行解释的九十天的期限，再拖过政治会议解决战俘问题的三十天的期限，在这个时期内尽可能不让战俘有任何听取解释、要求遣返的机会，尽可能不让政治会议有讨论战俘问题的机会，那末，到这一百二十天期限终了的时候，也就是到明年一月二十二日，他们强迫扣留战俘的阴谋就可以大功告成了。
    杜勒斯和卞荣泰都口口声声说他们根据的是朝鲜停战协定，他们像快要淹死的人抓住一根稻草似地死命抓住九十天的解释期限不放。可是，停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中规定战俘所属国家有“自由与便利”在九十天内向战俘解释他们的遣返权利，这自然不是说当这种“自由与便利”并不存在因而没有能够进行解释的日子也应算在九十天之内。如果硬要把这些日子也算在九十天之内，那末，除了这是企图剥夺战俘所属国家进行解释的权利和战俘听取解释要求遣返的权利以外，不可能作其他任何解释。杜勒斯的这种卑劣企图，显然完全违背了“职权范围”的“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”的精神。
    杜勒斯实际上对于停战协定的精神和条文毫不尊重。“职权范围”明明规定，中立国遣返委员会对于“职权范围”有解释权，可是中立国遣返委员会在九月二十五日确定的解释工作推迟开始则解释期限应予顺延的原则，杜勒斯却不想遵守。同样，对于中立国遣返委员会所拟定的“解释和访问工作细则”，美国方面也竭力加以破坏。“职权范围”明明规定，在政治会议讨论战俘问题三十天以后尚未行使遣返权利的战俘，“应由中立国遣返委员会宣布解除他们的战俘身分使之成为平民，然后根据各人的申请，其中凡有选择前往中立国者，应由中立国遣返委员会和印度红十字会予以协助。这一工作应在三十天内完成，完成后，中立国遣返委员会即停止职务并宣告解散”。可是杜勒斯和卞荣泰却要求将这些战俘在明年一月二十二日就交给美方去“释放”，根本不让战俘有选择、申请的机会，并且要印度看管部队马上撤走。他们对于停战协定的所谓尊重究竟在哪里？很明显，杜勒斯并没有把停战协定看作是一个庄严的国际条约，而只看作是一种他可以任意加以涂改的废纸。为了实现美国的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，他可以任意歪曲、抹煞、窜改其中的任何一条条文。
    朝中方面已经一再指出，由于美方对解释工作的蓄意拖延、破坏和阻挠，以致解释工作不能正常进行，因此，为了保障战俘的遣返权利，解释期限应以实际进行的时间为准。朝中方面这一坚定立场是决不动摇的。解释工作开始前后遣返归来的将近二百名战俘所控诉的美方强迫扣留战俘的种种骇人暴行，更加证明朝中方面这一主张是完全符合于“职权范围”的精神和人道原则的。杜勒斯企图缩短解释时间，使美国不致因为有更多的战俘要求遣返而遭到政治上道义上更惨重的失败，那是完全徒劳的。朝中方面现在正在密切注视着美方这一新阴谋的发展。
