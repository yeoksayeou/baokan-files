Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th: As of the 12th, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work has been suspended for five consecutive days due to special agents preventing prisoners of war from coming out to hear the explanations. Including the Indian Festival of Lights (Diwali) and Sunday, there has been no explanation for a whole week.

After the Korean-Chinese side gave individual explanations to 124 prisoners of war in Camp 22 on the 5th, on the 6th, 9th, and 10th, the Korean-Chinese side repeatedly proposed plans to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to explain to the prisoners of war in this camp who had not heard the explanation. However, because the U.S. side directed its special agents mixed in the camp to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to the explanation, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces failed to arrange the explanation work according to the Korean-Chinese side's plan. In order to dispel the U.S. side's excuse for obstructing the explanation work and to take care of the actual difficulties of the Indian troops, the Korean-Chinese side made new efforts and agreed to the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to explain to all the prisoners of war in one camp for several consecutive days before explaining to the prisoners of war in another camp. On the 11th and 12th, they proposed plans to explain to 150 prisoners of war in Camp 22, regardless of whether they had heard the explanation on the 5th. However, U.S. special agents still did not allow any prisoners of war to leave the camp. They also used this to coerce the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission into accepting their arrogant demands to restrict the time and number of our side's explanations to prisoners of war, in order to further undermine the explanation work.

Facts have proven that if the terrorist rule of special agents is not broken, the explanation work cannot proceed smoothly. According to a report from South Korea on the 10th by a reporter from the Indian Press Trust, General Thimayya said on the 10th that even if the Korean-Chinese side does not explain to the prisoners of war in Camp 22 but to the prisoners of war in other camps, "however, we may encounter the same deadlock as in Camp C-22 the next day." General Thimayya said, "The Indian delegation will agree to show or use some force," and he also said, "Although the opinions of the Swedish representative and the Indian representative are the same, the Swiss representative, Mr. Däniker, wants to withdraw from the committee." The attitude of the Swiss representative is strange. According to a report in the British "Manchester Guardian" on the 5th, the Swiss delegation said in its report to the Swiss government: "In fact, murders have occurred in the prisoner of war camps, and the victims are probably those prisoners of war who want to be repatriated." The Swiss representative clearly knew and admitted that prisoners of war who requested repatriation were wantonly murdered by special agents, but not only did they refuse to sanction the brutal rule of the special agents, but they also said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's taking necessary measures to carry out this sanction and remove the special agents in the camps was "inhumane." Could it be that these Swiss representatives at home in Switzerland can call protecting a gang of murderers humane, and call sanctioning and removing a gang of murderers to protect good people "inhumane"? ! Obviously, such things should not happen in Switzerland.

### 十二日我方解释工作因特务阻挠未能进行  瑞士代表承认特务谋杀战俘但反对采取制裁措施

    十二日我方解释工作因特务阻挠未能进行
    瑞士代表承认特务谋杀战俘但反对采取制裁措施
    【新华社开城十二日电】到十二日为止，朝中方面的解释工作由于特务阻止战俘出来听取解释，已经连续停顿五天了。加上印度千灯节和星期日，已经整整一周没有进行解释。
    朝中方面在五日向第二十二号营场的一百二十四个战俘进行了个别解释以后，六日、九日和十日，朝中方面连续向中立国遣返委员会提出对这个营场中没有听过解释的战俘进行解释的计划。但是由于美方指使其混在营场里的特务阻止战俘走出营场听取解释，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队未能根据朝中方面的计划安排解释工作。为了解除美方阻挠解释工作的籍口和照顾印度部队的实际困难，朝中方面作了新的努力，同意中立国遣返委员会的要求，在连续几天向一个营场的全部战俘解释完毕以后再向另一个营场的战俘进行解释，并且在十一日和十二日都提出计划向第二十二号营场的一百五十名战俘进行解释，而不管他们在五日是否已经听过解释。但是，美方特务仍然不准任何战俘走出营场。他们并借此要挟中立国遣返委员会接受其限制我方对战俘进行解释的时间和人数的狂妄要求，以便进一步破坏解释工作。
    事实证明：如果不打破特务的恐怖统治，解释工作就不能顺利进行。据印度报业托辣斯记者十日发自南朝鲜的报道，蒂迈雅中将在十日说：即使朝中方面不向第二十二号营场的战俘而向其他营场的战俘进行解释，“但是，到第二天我们可能又遇到和第C二十二号营场一样的僵局。”蒂迈雅中将说：“印度代表团将同意显示或使用一些武力”，他还说：“虽然瑞典代表和印度代表的意见相同，但瑞士代表邓尼克却要退出委员会”。瑞士代表的这种态度是令人奇怪的。据英国“曼彻斯特卫报”五日报道，瑞士代表团在其交给瑞士政府的报告中说：“事实上，战俘营中是发生过谋杀事件的，被害人大概是那些希望被遣返的战俘。”瑞士代表明明知道而且承认要求遣返的战俘被特务分子恣意谋杀，却不但不肯对特务的残暴统治加以制裁，反而说中立国遣返委员会采取必要的措施来进行这种制裁并清除营场里的特务分子是“不人道的”。难道这些瑞士代表们在瑞士国内能够将保护杀人匪帮称为人道，将制裁并清除杀人匪帮保护良民称为“不人道”吗？！显然，在瑞士是不应有这样事发生的。
