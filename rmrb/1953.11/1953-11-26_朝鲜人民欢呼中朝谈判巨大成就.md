Many factories, institutions, and schools held celebration meetings on the 24th to communicate and discuss the Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué.

    More than 800 workers of the Pyongyang Tobacco Factory and a certain engineering unit of the Korean People's Army, which is assisting the factory in its reconstruction work, held a meeting in the newly built auditorium on the evening of the 24th to warmly celebrate the great achievements of the Sino-Korean negotiations. After factory director An Dongxie conveyed the full text of the communiqué, warm cheers and applause resounded throughout the venue. Kim Sun-deok, a model female cigarette worker who won two third-class National Flag Medals, spoke excitedly, saying: During the war, the Chinese people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to help us fight. Now, after the armistice, they have given us a huge sum of 800 million yuan free of charge to help us restore construction. I deeply thank the great Chinese people and the respected Chairman Mao for their care for us. She pledged to complete 200% of the production task every day in early December, guarantee no defective products, train two technicians by the end of the year, and cherish and save state property. Finally, she called on everyone to repay the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries with practical actions. Her call received unanimous response from the workers. The meeting passed a resolution to vigorously increase production and practice thrift, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between Korea and China!" The loud slogans resounded throughout the entire factory. The same slogans also echoed from the newly built buildings of many other factories, institutions, and schools.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 25th: Pyongyang newspapers all published editorials on the 24th, warmly endorsing the communiqué of the negotiations between the government delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The title of the "Minju Choson" editorial was: "The Strengthening of Friendship Between the Korean and Chinese People is a Great Contribution to Peace in the Far East and the World." The editorial said: The great assistance given by the great Chinese people to our post-war reconstruction, as stated in the Sino-Korean government negotiation communiqué, has given us unlimited encouragement. When welcoming this good news, all Korean people must once again express their warm gratitude to the brotherly Chinese people and their wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and are determined to further strengthen the brotherly friendship and unity with the Chinese people. The editorial pointed out: The great assistance given by the Soviet people and the Chinese people will further promote the recovery and development of the Korean post-war people's economy and rapidly improve the peaceful life of the Korean people that has been devastated by the war. This assistance is also a new material force for defending peace in Asia and the world, and it will inspire all people to fight for peace, freedom, and independence.

    The editorial concluded: The Korean people have a deeper understanding of the greatness and nobility of the spirit of internationalism. In order to repay our beloved friendly countries, the Korean people are determined to strive to victoriously complete the historic task of restoring and reconstructing the Korean post-war people's economy with the brotherly assistance of the great Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries.

    "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial titled "The Benevolent Hands of 500 Million Brothers," saying: The Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué shows that the brotherly Chinese people are raising the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea even higher, and are continuing to extend their benevolent hands to us. The great assistance from the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of various people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people inspires us to carry out creative labor and further strengthens our confidence in victory. The Korean people are determined to strive to complete the work of restoring and developing the post-war people's economy, and to promote the peaceful reunification and prosperous development of the motherland.

    The editorial emphasized that now, the U.S. imperialists have not abandoned their ambition to invade Korea, and are creating various conspiracies to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. But their conspiracies are in vain. The solemn advance of the Korean people after the war cannot be stopped by any force.
