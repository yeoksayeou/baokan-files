    Northwestern Historical Museum and the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee organized a "Shaanxi Northern Revolutionary Cultural Relics Investigation and Collection Work Group" in mid-August, going to various parts of northern Shaanxi to work. With the assistance of the Qingjian, Suide and other local people's governments, the work group held small-scale symposiums, and used film projection teams and local newspapers to conduct focused publicity to the masses, explaining the significance of protecting cultural relics.
    The work group returned to Xi'an on October 10, bringing back more than 400 revolutionary cultural relics and more than 50 valuable historical relics collected from various parts of northern Shaanxi. Among them are two silver coins cast in the red areas during the First Revolutionary Civil War, as well as Children's Corps woodcut seals, stamps, imprints, and various weapons used by the guerrillas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. In addition, there are twenty-seven relief stone carvings unearthed from the Wang Deyuan tomb chamber of the Eastern Han Dynasty from the twelfth year of Yongyuan (100 AD) (most of these stone carvings are complete and the carving is extremely meticulous). The above-mentioned cultural relics have now been handed over to the Northwestern Historical Museum for sorting and preservation.

    西北历史博物馆和陕西省文物管理委员会征集陕北革命文物
    西北历史博物馆和陕西省文物管理委员会于八月中旬组织了“陕北革命文物调查、征集工作组”，前往陕北各地进行工作。工作组在清涧、绥德等地人民政府的协助下，举行小型座谈会，并利用电影放映队和当地报纸，有重点地向群众进行了宣传，说明保护文物的意义。
    工作组已于十月十日回到西安，并带回在陕北各地征集得来的革命文物四百余件和贵重历史文物五十余件。其中有第一次国内革命战争时期红色区域铸造的银币二枚，以及儿童团木刻印章、邮票、印花和游击队在第二次国内革命战争时期使用的各种武器等。此外，还有东汉王得元墓室内出土的永元十二年（公元一百年）之浮雕石刻二十七块（这批石刻大都完整，雕工极为细致）。现在，上述文物已交西北历史博物馆整理和保存。
