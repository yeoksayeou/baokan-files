Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 28th: Thirty thousand people in Pyongyang held a grand rally at the Pyongyang railway station plaza at noon on the 27th, warmly welcoming Marshal Kim Il-sung and the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea he led, who returned from their visit to China.

The welcoming crowds cheerfully held the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, portraits of leaders, banners, flowers, and slogans. That morning, they lined up neatly in the square, singing, chanting, and jumping, waiting for the arrival of the government delegation. At the top of the rostrum flew the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. Directly above the rostrum was a huge portrait of the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and of Lenin, Stalin, Malenkov, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung. Across the front of the stage was a colored banner: "Long live the eternal friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people!" Other places in Pyongyang also looked particularly neat and beautiful today. Stalin Road and Mao Zedong Road, as well as tall buildings, were decorated with the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, the flags of various people's democratic countries, and colorful welcoming slogans.

When the delegation's special train arrived at Pyongyang Station, the square erupted in thunderous applause and cheers: "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!" Marshal Kim Il-sung and the delegation representatives stepped out of the station and onto the rostrum, receiving flowers from women of Pyongyang. The square resounded again with warm applause and sustained cheers.

The chairman of the meeting, Zheng Yanbiao, chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, announced the opening of the meeting, and the military band played the national anthems of Korea and China. Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a report on his return from his visit to China (full text to be published separately). His report was interrupted many times by thunderous applause and cheers. Government representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Chang-ik and Hong Gi-ju, representative of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, delivered welcome speeches, warmly congratulating the government delegation headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung on their victorious completion of their mission, and expressing deep gratitude for the fraternal Chinese people's friendly care and assistance to the Korean people. They unanimously stated that the Korean people are determined to do their utmost to carry out the struggle to restore and build the national economy and strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Amidst thunderous applause, the meeting adopted a letter of thanks to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (full text to be published separately).

The meeting lasted for more than an hour and ended with the national anthems of China and Korea.

When the delegation headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung drove through the streets of Pyongyang after the meeting, they were welcomed by the citizens of Pyongyang lining the streets.
