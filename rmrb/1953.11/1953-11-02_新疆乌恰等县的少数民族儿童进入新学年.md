    Minority Children in Xinjiang's Akto and Other Counties Begin New School Year
    In Xinjiang, on the Pamir Plateau, children of the Kyrgyz and Tajik ethnic groups in Akto and Taxkorgan counties are now moving to winter pastures with their parents, beginning a new school year of learning and life. More than 20,000 Kyrgyz and Tajik herdsmen live on the high-altitude grasslands of Akto and Taxkorgan counties, where the snow-capped mountains overlap. Every spring, the children follow their parents to herd livestock in the deep mountains, and as winter approaches, they return with their parents, making winter the season for children in pastoral areas to study. In order to support the Kyrgyz and Tajik herdsmen in developing their ethnic culture and education, the People's Government has trained 58 teachers from these ethnic groups and allocated funds to build schools this year. Currently, nine primary schools have been established on the plateau, and 38 branch schools have been established in the more densely populated grasslands. This year, a total of more than 2,200 Kyrgyz and Tajik herdsmen children have enrolled.

    新疆乌恰等县的少数民族儿童进入新学年
    新疆帕米尔高原上的乌恰和蒲犁县的柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族的儿童们，现在正随着父母转移到冬季牧场，开始新学年的学习生活。在乌恰县和蒲犁县雪山重叠的高原草场上，居住着两万多柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族的牧民。每年春天，儿童们随着父母赶着牲畜向深山放牧，冬天快到时，又随着父母归来，冬季成为牧区儿童念书的季节。人民政府为扶助柯尔克孜和塔吉克族牧民发展本民族的文化教育，曾培养出五十八名本民族的教员，今年并拨款修建学校。现在，高原上已经建立了九所小学，在人口比较集中的草场上，又建立了三十八处分校。今年入学的柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族牧民的儿童共有二千二百多人。
