Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 9th: The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to prisoners of war on the 9th was again unable to proceed due to the obstruction of Kuomintang special agents preventing prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanations.

The Korean-Chinese side proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at 10:00 AM on the 8th a plan to continue explanations to prisoners of war in Camp 22 on the 9th, but due to the obstruction of special agents, the prisoners of war were again unable to come out to listen to the explanations. Since the start of the explanation work, twenty-six days have passed. Excluding rest days, out of the twenty-one days on which explanation work should have been conducted, explanations have failed to proceed on fifteen days due to the obstruction of special agents.

While directing special agents to do their utmost to undermine the explanation work, the US side also directs its propaganda machine to spread rumors and sow discord between the Korean-Chinese side and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, claiming that the Korean-Chinese side's request to continue explanations at Camp 22 is deliberately disrupting the explanation work and intentionally making things difficult for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. But this kind of lie will not find a market. The Korean-Chinese side's demands are fully in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." The only reason that the Korean-Chinese side's legitimate demands cannot be realized is that the Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camps do not allow prisoners of war to come out to listen to the explanations. The Indian spokesperson reiterated on the 7th that in each camp in the prisoner of war camps, there are so-called "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" special agent organizations, which are coercing prisoners of war not to request repatriation. These special agent organizations are directed from Seoul and Taipei. And everyone knows that the masters of Seoul and Taipei are the United States. Obviously, it is none other than the US side, which directly commands the Rhee and Chiang special agents, that is doing its utmost to undermine the explanation work and deliberately making things difficult for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

### 九日的解释工作因美方特务阻挠未能进行

    九日的解释工作因美方特务阻挠未能进行
    【新华社开城九日电】九日朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，又因为国民党特务阻止战俘出来听取解释而未能进行。
    朝中方面在八日上午十时就向中立国遣返委员会提出在九日继续对第二十二号营场战俘进行解释的计划，但是由于特务的阻挠，战俘又不能出来听取解释。自从解释工作开始以来，已经过去了二十六天，除去休息日以外，在应该进行解释工作的二十一天中，有十五天因为特务的阻挠而未能进行解释。
    美方一方面指使特务竭力破坏解释工作，一方面又指使御用宣传机器大肆造谣，挑拨朝中方面和中立国遣返委员会之间的关系，说什么朝中方面要求继续对二十二号营场进行解释，是在故意破坏解释工作，故意和中立国遣返委员会为难。但是这种谎言是找不到市场的。朝中方面的要求，是完全符合于停战协定和“解释和访问工作细则”的。使朝中方面的正当要求不能实现的唯一原因，是战俘营中的李承晚和蒋介石特务不许战俘出来听取解释。印度的发言人在七日再度指出，在战俘营里每个营场中都有所谓“反共青年团”的特务组织，它们正在胁迫战俘不得要求遣返。这些特务组织是受汉城和台北的指挥的。而大家知道，汉城和台北的主子就是美国。很明显，竭力破坏解释工作，故意和中立国遣返委员会为难的不是别人，正是直接指挥着李、蒋特务的美方。
