Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 28th: The letter of gratitude from the Pyongyang City mass rally welcoming the return of the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from its visit to China, to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China, reads as follows: Today, we participate in the Pyongyang City mass rally welcoming the Korean government delegation's visit to China, and together with all the Korean people, express our nationwide gratitude and congratulations to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, for the enormous assistance given to the Korean people based on the negotiations held between the governments of Korea and China. All the Korean people warmly support and welcome with boundless joy and gratitude the communiqué on the negotiations held between the governments of Korea and China, and the Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation between Korea and China. This time, foreseeing the enormous expenditure needed for the Korean people to restore and build the post-war people's economy, the Government of the People's Republic of China decided to donate all materials and expenses used to aid Korea from June 25, 1950, to the end of 1953, and to donate RMB 8,000 billion yuan free of charge as funds for the restoration of the people's economy. This is a powerful material guarantee for the rapid development of our country's industry, transportation, rural economy, education, culture, and other sectors, as well as for improving and raising the living standards of our people. It encourages us, fighting for the peaceful reunification and independence of our homeland, to march towards new victories. The Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation signed between the governments of Korea and China will further consolidate and develop the strong and great friendship and unity forged in blood between the peoples of Korea and China in the sacred struggle against the US armed aggressors, expand and strengthen long-term cooperation between the two countries in the economic and cultural fields, and make a huge contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. This is a serious warning to the US imperialist aggressors who, disregarding the hopes and demands of the people of the world, are attempting to delay and undermine the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The fraternal Chinese people's selfless assistance to the Korean people is a vivid example of proletarian internationalism and a clear symbol of further strengthening friendly relations among the Asian people striving for peace and freedom. Today, inspired by the active assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, with the great Soviet Union at their head, the entire people of the Republic are rising up as one in the sacred struggle to restore and build the people's economy and peacefully unify the homeland, in order to strive for the infinite prosperity of our country and the happiness of future generations. However, the American aggressors, disregarding the irreparable and disastrous defeat suffered in the war, not only do not abandon their sinister aggressive intentions, but also concluded a "Korean-American Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang who are clamoring for a "Northern Expedition," and are trying every possible means to delay and undermine the convening of the political conference. Therefore, we, the Korean people, will not relax our revolutionary vigilance against the enemy and are filled with the firm determination to continuously smash the conspiracies of the US imperialists. We, the Korean people, have achieved victory under the banner of friendship and unity with the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with their active assistance and support. We deeply know that our future struggle under this banner will surely achieve glorious victory. To this end, we must protect the friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China and the peoples of all democratic countries, headed by the Soviet Union, as we would protect our own eyes. We, the Korean people, are firmly determined to unite like steel around the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, continue to consolidate and develop the great victory achieved by the peoples of Korea and China in their common struggle, and rapidly complete the great cause of restoring and developing the post-war people's economy and peacefully unifying the homeland, in order to repay the internationalist assistance of the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of all people's democratic countries. Finally, we sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, who are striving to realize the solemn Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, new achievements and victories.

    平壤市欢迎朝鲜政府代表团归国大会
    给中共中央和我国政府的感谢信
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】平壤市群众欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府访问中国代表团大会给中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府的感谢信，文如下：今天，我们参加平壤市群众欢迎朝鲜政府访问中国代表团大会，和全体朝鲜人民一道向根据这次朝中两国政府举行的谈判而给予我们朝鲜人民以巨大援助的伟大的中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席，致以全民性的感谢与祝贺。全体朝鲜人民以无限的欢欣和感激热烈支持和欢迎关于朝中两国政府举行的谈判的公报和朝中经济及文化合作协定。这次，中华人民共和国政府预见到朝鲜人民恢复和建设战后人民经济事业需要莫大的开支，决定赠予从一九五零年六月二十五日起截至一九五三年末这一时期中援助朝鲜的一切物资和用费，并无偿地赠送人民币八万亿元，作为恢复人民经济之费用。这是迅速发展我国工业、交通运输、农村经济与教育文化等各部门以及改善和提高我国人民生活的强有力的物质保证。它鼓舞着为祖国的和平统一与独立而奋起斗争的我们走向新的胜利。朝中两国政府之间所签订的经济及文化合作协定，将进一步巩固和发展朝中两国人民在反对美国武装侵略者的神圣斗争中以鲜血结成的坚强、伟大的友谊团结，扩大和加强两国在经济及文化方面长期的合作关系，对保卫亚洲和世界和平事业作出巨大的贡献。这对于不顾全世界人民的希望和要求而企图拖延和破坏朝鲜问题和平解决的美帝国主义侵略者，却是一个严重的警告。兄弟般的中国人民对朝鲜人民这样的无私援助，是无产阶级国际主义的生动榜样，也是为争取和平与自由的亚洲人民进一步加强友好关系的鲜明标志。今天，共和国全体人民为以伟大的苏联为首的中国及各人民民主国家人民的积极援助所鼓舞，像一个人似地在奋起进行恢复建设人民经济与和平统一祖国的神圣斗争，以争取我们祖国的无限繁荣和子孙万代的幸福。然而，美国侵略者不顾在战争中遭到的不可挽救的惨败，不但不放弃其凶恶的侵略企图，而且和叫嚣着“北伐”的李承晚匪帮缔结了“韩美共同防御条约”，在千方百计地企图拖延和破坏政治会议的召开。因此，我们朝鲜人民将毫不松懈对敌人的革命警惕性，并充满着要连续粉碎美帝国主义者的阴谋的坚强决心。我们朝鲜人民在与以苏联为首的世界民主阵营的友谊团结的旗帜下并在他们的积极援助和支援下，已经取得了胜利。我们深知：我们今后在这个旗帜下的斗争也必将取得光荣的胜利。为此，我们要像保卫自己的眼珠一样地保卫朝中两国人民和以苏联为首的民主阵营各国人民之间的友谊团结。我们朝鲜人民立下坚定不移的决心，要像钢铁般地团结在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的周围，继续巩固和发展朝中两国人民在共同斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，迅速完成恢复和发展战后人民经济与和平统一祖国的伟大事业，以报答伟大的苏联人民、中国人民和各人民民主国家人民的国际主义援助。最后，我们谨祝在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，奋起实现着庄严的五年经济建设计划的兄弟般的中国人民取得新的成就和胜利。
