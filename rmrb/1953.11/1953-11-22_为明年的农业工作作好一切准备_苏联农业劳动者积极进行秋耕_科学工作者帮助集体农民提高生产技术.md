Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - In order to respond to the call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to strive for a new high tide in agriculture, Soviet agricultural laborers are actively completing this year's agricultural work and making all preparations for next year's agricultural work.

Harvesting of various crops is being completed throughout the Soviet Union, and agricultural products are being actively sold to the state. Agricultural laborers in various regions are enthusiastically engaged in autumn plowing. As of November 5th, the Soviet Union had plowed 15 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) more of autumn plowing land and fallow land than in the same period last year. In the southern regions, the work of plowing autumn plowing land and fallow land is about to be completed. Agricultural laborers are now storing crop seeds, preparing greenhouses and hotbeds, building production sites, and repairing tractors and various connected agricultural machinery. The fourteen states of Voroshilovgrad, Dnepropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporozhye, Kirovograd, Stalino, Kharkov, Chernigov, Volyn, Rovno, Stanislav, Voronezh, Stalingrad, and Kaliningrad have successfully completed their autumn plowing plans. Among them, Voronezh Oblast has plowed more than 1.5 million hectares of land. Rovno Oblast, in addition to autumn plowing, has also completed its plans for other agricultural tasks. Agricultural machine workers in Odessa Oblast are rapidly completing autumn plowing work. Twenty machine tractor stations, by organizing tractor drivers to implement a two-shift work system, have completed their contractual obligations to the collective farms. The entire oblast has plowed 238,000 hectares more of autumn plowing land than in the same period last year.

In terms of livestock breeding and other agricultural work, the livestock farms of collective farms in Kirov Oblast have begun preparing for the wintering of livestock. They are more organized than in the past in insulating cattle sheds and storing feed. Villagers have launched a competition to save feed. The work of processing feed has been widely mechanized. Collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations in the Estonian Republic are generally building livestock sheds, forage depots, agricultural machinery parking sheds, open-air threshing grounds, and other production sites. Ulyanovsk and other states are also seriously carrying out the construction of tractor stations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - The creative cooperation between Soviet scientific workers and collective farmers is an important factor in the continuous and rapid progress of Soviet agricultural production technology. The cooperation between the Kuban Agricultural Research Institute and the Kirov Collective Farm is a good illustration of this.

Professors and lecturers from the Kuban Agricultural Research Institute often go to the Kirov Collective Farm in Korenovsky District to offer many suggestions for improving agricultural production. Scientific workers from the institute's animal husbandry department help the collective farm's livestock farms select good breeds of livestock, build livestock pens, and prescribe methods for feeding livestock with green fodder, enabling the farm to overfulfill its milk and wool production plans year after year. The institute's renowned professors have repeatedly answered questions for the farm's agronomists, production team leaders, and advanced villagers on the subject of planting winter wheat. With the help of the professors, the collective farm was the first in Kuban to adopt large-scale deep plowing, close planting, and cross-sowing methods, and applied granular fertilizer, which rapidly increased the yield of winter wheat. For example, in 1950, the farm produced an average of only 930 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare (1 hectare equals 15 mu), which increased to 1,370 kilograms in 1951, 2,260 kilograms in 1952, and 2,350 kilograms this year. This year, an advanced production team harvested 2,580 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare on 821 hectares of land. Scientific workers at the institute also often invite collective farm villagers to the institute to exchange production experiences. The chairman of the Kirov Collective Farm has made several reports at scientific conferences held at the institute on the farm's production and on how villagers promote new scientific achievements in production.

     【新华社莫斯科二十一日电】苏联农业劳动者为了响应苏联共产党提出的争取农业的新高涨的号召，正在积极地结束今年的农业工作，并为明年农业工作作好一切准备。
    苏联全国各地正在完成收获各种农作物的工作，积极向国家交售农产品。各地的农业劳动者正在热烈进行秋耕工作。截至十一月五日为止，苏联全国已比去年同期多翻耕了一千五百万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的秋耕地和休耕地。在南部地区，翻耕秋耕地和休耕地的工作即将结束。农业劳动者现在正在贮存农作物的种子，准备温室和温床，建筑生产场所，并修理拖拉机和各种连挂农业机械。伏罗希洛夫格勒、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、什托密尔、萨波罗什、基洛夫格勒、斯大林诺、哈尔科夫、切尔尼哥夫、沃利诺、罗夫诺、斯塔尼斯拉夫、沃罗涅兹、斯大林格勒、加里宁格勒等十四州，已胜利地完成了秋耕计划。其中沃罗涅兹州共翻耕了一百五十多万公顷田地。罗夫诺州除了秋耕工作外，还完成了其他农业工作的计划。敖德萨州农业机器工人正在迅速完成秋耕工作。其中有二十个机器拖拉机站由于组织拖拉机手实行两班工作制，已经完成了合同上规定的对集体农庄的义务。全州比去年同期多翻耕了二十三万八千公顷秋耕地。
    在牲畜饲养和其他农业工作方面，基洛夫州各集体农庄的饲畜场已开始为牲畜作好准备过冬的工作。他们比过去更有组织地进行牛舍保暖和储备饲料。庄员们展开了节约饲料的竞赛。加工饲料的工作已广泛机械化。爱沙尼亚共和国集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站普遍都在建筑畜舍、饲草库、农业机器停放房、露天打谷场等生产场所。乌里扬诺夫斯克等州也认真地进行着拖拉机站的建筑工作。
     【新华社莫斯科二十一日电】苏联科学工作者和集体农民之间的创造性的合作，是苏联农业生产技术不断飞跃进步的一个重要因素。库班农业研究所和基洛夫集体农庄合作的情况就是一个很好的说明。
    库班农业研究所的教授、讲师们经常到科雷诺夫区基洛夫集体农庄去，对该农庄提出许多改进农业生产的建议。研究所畜牧系的科学工作者帮助集体农庄饲畜场挑选良种牲畜，建造饲畜栏和规定用青饲料喂牲畜的办法，使农庄年年超额完成挤牛乳和剪羊毛的生产计划。研究所的著名的教授们曾多次为农庄的农艺师、生产队队长和先进庄员解答关于种植冬小麦的问题。在教授们的帮助下，这个集体农庄便在库班首先大规模采用了深耕、密植和交叉播种的方法，施用了粒状肥料，因而使冬小麦的收获量迅速提高。例如，一九五零年该农庄每公顷（合十五市亩）平均只出产九百三十公斤冬小麦，一九五一年就增加到一千三百七十公斤，一九五二年增加到二千二百六十公斤，今年又增加到二千三百五十公斤，今年有一个先进的生产队在八百二十一公顷的田地上每公顷收了二千五百八十公斤冬小麦。研究所的科学工作者也时常邀请集体农庄庄员到研究所来交流生产经验，基洛夫集体农庄主席曾在该研究所举行的科学会议上作过多次关于农庄的生产、关于庄员如何在生产中推行科学新成就的报告。
