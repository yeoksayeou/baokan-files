　　Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

　　When my two children heard that I was going to write to you, they both crowded around, clamoring to have their thoughts written down as well. But, comrades, they wanted me to write this and write that, how could I write so much! Let me just write down the guarantees they made to you! They guarantee to learn from the spirit of Cunrui and you, to study hard now, to work hard in the future, and to train themselves to become useful talents for our country. You know, children never speak empty words; they do what they say. Cunmei is a girl, only seventeen years old, and she studies very diligently. Whenever she has free time, she is either reading or writing. A few days ago, she joined the Communist Youth League and became a glorious member! Her younger brother is the same way; his exam scores last semester were all above eighty. Not only do they study hard, but they also help me with work very actively! A few days ago, when school was out for autumn vacation, they didn't idle around when they returned home; they were always helping me with chores.

　　Although I am old, I never admit to being old in my heart. The young lads in our village often say to me, "Uncle Dong, you are old, just tell us what needs to be done, and we can help you!" Comrades, think about it, I am a glorious family member of a martyr, and I come from the working people. Labor is our duty, how can I fall behind these young people! In 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army unit and the Huailai County People's Government sent me pension money and relief grain, and I used it to buy sheep. The flock has grown larger and larger, and now there are forty of them. Sheep manure is really good for the land. This year, an average of forty loads were applied per acre, and as many as four hundred loads were applied to the four acres of millet land. In addition, with timely sowing and hoeing, the four acres of millet yielded more than seven *shi*, and the other land also yielded 20% more than the average household!

　　Currently, the Guanting Reservoir and the Fengtai-Shacheng section of the railway are being built within Huailai County. In order to support the construction of the Guanting Reservoir and the Feng-Sha section of the railway, I have woven many baskets during the slack season, earning more than 700,000 *yuan*. More than twenty days ago, comrades who were building the railway came to our village and said that the construction site urgently needed one hundred pairs of baskets and asked us to help. At that time, it was the busy farming season, and the villagers were all too busy to spare a hand. But I thought: Chairman Mao taught us that workers and peasants are one family, and the worker-peasant alliance is building a new China. You have saved so much grain in the war to support the construction of the motherland. If we cannot complete the task of one hundred pairs of baskets, how can we be worthy of Chairman Mao and you! I discussed it with everyone, and they all agreed with my opinion. We then used the night time to hurry up and weave baskets, completing the task on time. In two nights, I myself wove more than ten pairs.

　　Comrades, our peasants have much broader horizons than in the past. They know the past, know the present, and also know the future. I remember when I participated in the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to visit you last year, one soldier said to me: "Uncle Dong, on the front line of defending the motherland, we only have hatred for the enemy and are not afraid of any difficulties!" As for us, we are building the motherland. On the front line of supporting you, we only have strength and are not afraid of any difficulties. I guarantee to grow more grain to support you! Until the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　多打粮食，支援你们
    董全忠
    编者按：董全忠是解放军著名战斗英雄董存瑞的父亲。董存瑞烈士于一九四八年五月，在我军解放热河省隆化县城时，舍身炸毁敌人碉堡，壮烈牺牲。		    ＊　　　  ＊　　　  ＊亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：
    我跟前的两个孩子，一听说我要给你们写信，就一齐围拢来，嚷着要叫把他们的心意也写在上面。可是，同志们，他们这也要我写上，那也要我写上，我怎么能写那么多呢！还是只写他们对你们提出的保证吧！他们保证要学习存瑞和你们的精神，现在好好念书，将来好好工作，把自己磨炼成咱们国家有用的人才。你们知道，孩子们是决不说白话的，说到那里，就做到那里。存梅是个女孩子，才十七岁，学习特别用心。一有空，不是看书，就是写字。前些日子，她已经加入了青年团，成了光荣的青年团员啦！她的弟弟也是一样，上学期的大考成绩全在八十分以上。他们不光学习努力，帮我干活也可积极哩！前几天学校放秋假，他俩回到家里也没闲着，老是帮我做活。
    我人虽老了，可是我心里总是不服老。我们村里的年轻小伙子常对我说：“董大伯，你老了，有啥事只管说话，我们可以帮你做！”同志们，想想看，我是个光荣的烈士家属，又是劳苦人民出身，劳动就是咱的本分，还能落到这群年轻人的后头！一九五○年，中国人民解放军某部和怀来县人民政府，送给我的抚恤金和救济粮，我都买了羊，羊群越来越大，现在已有四十来只。羊粪上地真好，今年平均每亩地上了四十驮，四亩黍子地，上了足有四百驮。再加上耧、锄及时，光四亩黍子就收了七石多，别的地，也比一般户多收二成！
    目前，在怀来县境内，正在修建官厅水库和丰（丰台）沙（沙城）段铁路。为了支援官厅水库和丰沙段铁路的建设，在农闲时节，我就编了很多筐子，挣了七十多万元。二十多天前，修建铁路的同志到我们村上来，他们说工地急需用一百对筐子，要我们帮忙。当时正是农忙时节，老乡们全都忙得腾不出手来。可是我想：毛主席教导我们工人农民是一家，工农联盟建设新中国，你们为了支援祖国的建设，在打仗中还节省了那么多粮食，一百对筐子的任务要完不成的话，还能对得起毛主席，对得起你们！我和大伙一商量，都同意我的意见。我们便利用夜晚的时间，赶紧编筐，按时完成了任务。在两个夜里，我自己也编成了十来对。
    同志们，咱们农民的眼界都比过去开阔得多了，知道过去，知道现在，也知道将来。记得去年我参加中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团去看你们的时候，一个战士对我说：“董大伯，在保卫祖国的战线上，我们只有对敌人的仇恨，不怕任何困难！”我们呢，我们在建设祖国。支援你们的战线上，也是只有力量，不怕任何困难的，我保证多多打粮食，支援你们！直到抗美援朝取得最后胜利。
