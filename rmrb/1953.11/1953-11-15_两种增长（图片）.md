Two Kinds of Growth

According to estimates by American bourgeois newspapers, the profits of American monopoly capitalists this year have reached an unprecedented peak—$44.6 billion, an increase of nearly six times compared to 1939 ($6.5 billion), and an increase of 39% compared to 1949 ($27.1 billion). These profits were obtained in the war of aggression against Korea, in the creation of international tension, and in the exploitation and enslavement of their own people and other peoples. As Lenin said, every gold coin is stained with blood. According to official statistics from Western European countries, the total number of unemployed people in twelve major capitalist countries in Western Europe reached 4.3 million by April of this year, an increase of 1.34 million compared to 1948. The hunger and poverty of these unemployed masses are one of the sources of the Wall Street bosses' greatest profits. This is the truth about American "aid" to European "revival," and also a kind of "prosperity" created by the Marshall Plan for Western Europe.

    两种增长
    据美国资产阶级报纸的估计，今年美国垄断资本家的利润达到空前未有的高峰——四百四十六亿美元，和一九三九年比较（六十五亿美元）增加了将近六倍，比一九四九年（二百七十一亿美元），也增加了百分之三十九。这些利润都是在侵略朝鲜的战争中，在制造国际紧张局势中以及在对本国人民和别国人民的剥削奴役中取得的，正像列宁说过的，每一块金元上都留下血迹。据西欧国家的官方统计，西欧十二个主要资本主义国家到今年四月的全失业人数已达四百三十万人，比一九四八年又增加了一百三十四万人。这些失业群的饥饿和穷困，正是华尔街老板最大利润的来源之一，这就是美国“援助”欧洲“复兴”的真相，也是马歇尔计划给西欧创造的“繁荣”景象的一种。
