    A School with Too Many Science and Engineering Teachers
    Reader Li Yuchang writes: I was originally a physics student at university, but after liberation, due to work needs, I was assigned to Nanchang No. 1 Middle School as a political teacher before graduating. Because I have a great love for physics, I continued to study it in my spare time. Last year, after the People's Daily called for the rational use of science and engineering talent, I obtained the consent of the school leadership and returned to Nanchang University to resume my studies. After graduating this summer, I was assigned to my original work unit—Nanchang No. 1 Middle School. However, Nanchang No. 1 Middle School does not need a physics teacher. Instead, the school asked me to do trade union work.
    Our school wastes science and engineering talent in many ways. For example, our high school department only has sixty-two physics lessons per week, but we have seven physics teachers, averaging less than nine lessons per person. Last year, a physics teacher was transferred to do academic affairs work, scheduling courses and making plans for an entire semester. This year, a teacher who studied electrical engineering is the director of general affairs. The school calls me a teacher in name but has me doing trade union work. I think this practice of wasting the strength of science and engineering teachers is very unreasonable.

    一个理工教员过多的学校
    读者李毓昌来信：我原是大学物理系的学生，解放后因工作需要，没有毕业就被分配到南昌第一中学做政治教员。因为我对物理很爱好，业余仍进行自修。去年人民日报号召合理使用理工人材后，我征得学校领导方面的同意，又到南昌大学去复学。今年暑假毕业后，我被分配到原工作机关——南昌第一中学。但南昌第一中学并不需要物理教师，学校却叫我搞工会工作。
    我校使用理工人材是有很多浪费的，如我校高中部每周只有六十二节物理课，可是物理教师倒有七个，平均每人上不到九节课。去年一个物理老师调去搞教务工作，排课程表、订计划，整整搞了一个学期。今年一个学电机工程的老师做了总务主任。学校里叫我挂一个教员之名，来搞工会工作，我认为这种浪费理工教员力量的做法是非常不合理的。
