The testimony of Colonel Walker M. Mahurin, Commander of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, U.S. Air Force

    My name is Walker M. Mahurin, service number 8658A, born December 5, 1918, in Petoskey, Michigan. I am a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and hold a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering.

    After active duty in World War II, I returned to the United States with the rank of lieutenant colonel. At that time, I was assigned as a fighter aircraft program officer in the Procurement Division of U.S. Air Force Headquarters. I continued to work in the Fighter Procurement Division and became the chief of the Fighter Aircraft Section of the Strategic Air Command. Around June 1950, I was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force as an administrative assistant.

    According to the traditional practices of U.S. Air Force Headquarters, personnel working in the Secretary's Office were required to obtain a security clearance certifying their reliability because our positions demanded that we be trustworthy individuals. The FBI conducted a reliability investigation on me, and I was deemed trustworthy and granted an "M" level clearance. The "M" level clearance is higher than the "Top Secret" clearance.

    I first gained some knowledge about bacteriological warfare in November 1950, when I was instructed by my superior, Colonel Teale, Deputy Director of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, to visit Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland.

    Colonel Teale told me that the Air Force was conducting experiments at Camp Detrick to determine the best methods for carrying and dropping bacteriological weapons by aircraft. All these experiments were being conducted to create a suitable type of bacteriological bomb that would contain a specific composition of explosives and infectious material, so that after the bomb exploded upon impact, the infectious material within would remain alive, thereby causing dangerous consequences in the area.

    Colonel Teale pointed out that senior military leaders, such as General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Vandenberg, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Collins, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Admiral Sherman, Chief of Naval Operations, all believed that bacteriological weapons were both effective and inexpensive and should be developed to occupy a certain place in the arsenal. Although the Korean War was progressing smoothly at that time, the future was unpredictable. Therefore, due to the uncertainty of future situations, the bacteriological warfare program was entering the experimental and developmental stages.

    Colonel Teale said that senior Air Force authorities, including Secretary of the Air Force Finletter and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Vandenberg, had formulated a policy to select officers from within U.S. Air Force Headquarters to familiarize themselves with the work at Camp Detrick. According to this policy, several officers from our office would visit the camp. Typically, the Air Force familiarizes its officers with new programs so that in the future, when these programs gain importance, they will have a general understanding of what their superiors are considering. Colonel Teale said that Camp Detrick was researching bacteriological bombs that could be carried by various types of bombers, such as B-26, B-29, B-50, etc. Colonel Teale also said that he would like to hear my opinions on the work being conducted at Detrick because he knew that I had some experience in fighter aircraft. Colonel Teale believed that an effort should be made to consider how fighter aircraft could carry and drop bacteriological bombs.

    Colonel Teale emphasized to me that this program was considered "Top Secret." The research work at Detrick was conducted under conditions of extreme secrecy.

    I visited Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, in mid-November 1950. After my credentials were checked at the gate, I was led by a guide to tour the research center.

    The camp was owned and administered by the Army Ordnance Corps and the Chemical Corps. The Air Force occupied a portion of it, while the rest was used by the Army. The camp was commanded by the Army. The Air Force unit in Frederick was under the leadership of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Materiel at U.S. Air Force Headquarters, who at that time was Lieutenant General Wolfe.

    The camp employed civilian personnel in various positions. These individuals were well-trained technicians who performed all the actual work. In addition, there were secretarial staff.

    The research center had a large steel sphere, which I estimated to be sixty feet in diameter. The sphere was of sturdy construction, with double walls separated by a certain distance. There were several small windows made of thick, shatterproof glass at intervals around the sphere. There were several small doors around the sphere, from which air could be pumped out as samples. At the bottom of the sphere was a heavy door that could be opened for access to the interior for installations. On the outer wall of the sphere was a narrow walkway that circled the sphere, allowing people to observe the interior from the windows and to easily access the small doors to extract air samples.

    The purpose of the sphere was to provide a place for experimental explosions of the weapons being studied. After an explosion, air samples extracted from the sphere could reveal how much of the bomb's contents that could cause harm remained alive.

    At that time, the camp was researching a bacteriological bomb for use with the B-29 aircraft. The bomb was approximately eighteen inches long and two and a half inches in diameter. The tail had several small fins to ensure accurate landing. Their intention was to have bombers carry clusters of bacteriological bombs, each cluster composed of many of these small bacteriological bombs. When dropped, they would scatter and distribute over a large area.

    I witnessed an experimental explosion of one of these bacteriological bombs inside the sphere. The bomb was suspended in the exact center of the sphere by metal wires, so that it would be equidistant from all sides of the sphere. The personnel involved in the experiment waited outside the sphere around the various small openings, ready to extract air samples. At an appropriate time, the bomb was detonated using electrical equipment. Fragments fell to the bottom of the sphere, and the bomb's contents were dispersed into the air. Then, air samples were extracted and sent to nearby laboratories to determine how much of the bomb's contents remained undamaged after the explosion within the sphere. Animals could then be placed inside the sphere to determine the lethal effects produced by the bomb's contents after the explosion.

    The purpose of this experiment was to discover the most suitable size and shape of bacteriological bombs for this purpose. Experiments were also conducted to discover the most suitable materials for making the bomb casing, such as steel, aluminum, bakelite, etc. Obviously, the smaller the explosive force needed to destroy the casing, the more of the bomb's contents would survive. They had modified various materials for manufacturing the casing to ensure that the bomb could explode easily without killing all the contents.

    There was a laboratory next to the building where the sphere was located. Chemists examined air samples extracted from the sphere here. In addition, the bomb's contents used for testing were also stored in the laboratory. The bomb's contents stored in the laboratory were similar in form to bacteria. The effects obtained by testing with these contents could generally indicate the effects that could be obtained when using bacteria. Before testing, laboratory personnel always placed this substance into test bombs. Laboratory personnel always wore thick protective clothing when handling infectious materials.

    Several heated greenhouses were also associated with this unit. There were approximately three or four of these houses, which I estimated to be sixty feet long and twenty-four feet wide each. These heated greenhouses were used to cultivate various fungi that could be found on crops. These fungi were concentrated in the heated greenhouses to be used for testing. This fungus could be used as a carrier for bacteria that harm crops. The purpose of the bacteria mentioned here was to cause crops to wither and die, or to reduce the yield of various crops. Various vegetables were planted in the greenhouses. However, the bacteria being tested could destroy all kinds of crops.

    Around the buildings I visited were several large open areas, used to determine the impact of natural climate on the various organisms in the air after an aircraft dropped a bomb. In this scenario, after a bacteriological bomb exploded, air samples were taken at varying distances from the center of the explosion. The effects of wind and temperature, as well as the dispersion effect, could be discovered using this method. This experiment was conducted with precision in every detail.

    The experimental bacteriological bombs themselves were manufactured at the research center. Once the research center determined the best design (of the bacteriological bomb), it could be manufactured on a large scale.

    At the end of the visit, my guide told me that they were researching various types of bacteria. These bacteria could cause effects harmful to humans, animals, and crops. He said the desired result was to cause disease and impair work and combat capabilities.

    I asked my guide if they had also considered using fighter aircraft to do this work. He told me that the research had not progressed to that stage, and currently they were only conducting research on equipment for bombers. He also said that once they received instructions, they could easily study the possibility of fighter aircraft using the same types of bacteriological bombs.

    The next day, when I returned to the Pentagon to work, I reported to Colonel Teale that I had visited the camp as he had instructed. He asked me what I thought of the work being conducted at the camp from the perspective of fighter aircraft. I told him that the bacteriological bombs I had seen that the research center had developed so far were not suitable for high-speed jet aircraft. Colonel Teale said that if fighter aircraft were used to carry these types of weapons, their potential would increase. Neither of us believed that this would be too difficult.

    One morning a few days later, Colonel Teale called me to Mr. Finletter's office to meet him. He said the Secretary wanted to hear about the situation at Camp Detrick. When Colonel Teale and I arrived at the Secretary's office, Colonel Teale acted as the spokesperson and gave a general overview of the activities at Camp Detrick. The Secretary listened attentively to what Colonel Teale said. Colonel Teale relayed my observation that it seemed that the use of fighter aircraft had not been considered, although it would not be very difficult to use fighter aircraft in this regard. The Secretary, who was a man of few words, said that he was glad to hear our opinions. He said that this opinion confirmed his past thoughts on the matter, and in fact, he had discussed this with General Vandenberg. He also said that General Vandenberg had told him that the Air Force Staff was considering this matter and that some decision should be made in the near future. When Colonel Teale finished his briefing, the Secretary thanked us for providing him with information, and we left his office.

    I was promoted to colonel in February 1951, and in April, I was appointed as the commander of the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group stationed at Victorville, California.

    In the last week of October 1951, I received a notice transmitted by teletype from U.S. Air Force Headquarters, ordering me to report immediately to Major General Saville, who worked under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations in the U.S. Air Force. When I reported to Major General Saville, Brigadier General Cullen and Colonel McNichol were also summoned to his office.

    General Saville presided over the meeting, saying, "General Vandenberg has ordered the transfer of seventy-five F-86E aircraft to Korea to replace the F-80 aircraft of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. You, Mahurin, and you, McNichol, will be responsible for this project." General Saville explained that the purpose of these aircraft was related to the bacteriological warfare program being conducted in Korea.

    General Saville said that instructions had been received from high-ranking authorities in the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to conduct a limited bacteriological warfare campaign in Korea. This instruction had been sent through the office of Air Force Chief of Staff General Vandenberg to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations in the U.S. Air Force. After receiving this entire plan, the Air Force Chief of Staff's office divided it into several parts, which were sent to various staff departments for appropriate measures to be taken. At that time, only a few people knew the full picture of this plan.

    The goal of the bacteriological warfare program was to use such weapons in the actual battlefield conditions in Korea to test their effectiveness. In addition, the scale of the use of such weapons in the Korean War could be expanded depending on future circumstances. Containers that could be carried by different types of aircraft would be tested, and such weapons would be dropped in various terrains and under various climatic conditions. At the same time, it was hoped that negotiations might be influenced by this plan, thereby potentially leading to a satisfactory outcome. At that time, the Air Force had manufactured for the F-86 aircraft a tank-like container that could be attached under the wings to carry insects infected with various germs. This tank-like container would be tested by the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in actual combat conditions.

    The reason why the F-86E aircraft were being transferred to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing was that these aircraft had better performance than the older F-86A aircraft and could perform better. General Saville also said that orders had been sent to various units across the United States to transfer F-86E aircraft and their personnel to Naval Air Station Alameda in California for shipment to Korea. Colonel McNichol and I would be responsible for ensuring that everything was ready before the scheduled departure date. After this transfer work began, we would have an obligation to keep General Saville informed of the situation.

    General Saville explained that Colonel McNichol's part in this plan would end after the aircraft left the United States. However, after this transfer work was completed, I would receive orders to be transferred to Korea. He also said that after arriving in Tokyo, Japan, I would have to report to General Weyland, Commander of the Far East Air Forces. He mentioned that two officers would be sent abroad around the same time, but the personnel had not yet been selected, and I would meet them in Japan or Korea.

    When General Saville concluded the meeting, he reminded Colonel McNichol and me to maintain secrecy and asked us never to tell anyone else about the bacteriological warfare plan he had told us about.

    The transfer of aircraft and personnel was scheduled to be completed by November 5, 1951, so I arranged to meet Colonel McNichol in Alameda on November 4 to conduct an inspection.

    I arrived at Naval Air Station Alameda on November 4, 1951. McNichol had arrived there the previous night from Washington and was waiting for me. We immediately began the inspection. Of course, only the two of us knew about the bacteriological warfare plan and its background. After we finished the inspection, we sent a teletype message to General Saville, reporting the results of the inspection. Colonel McNichol then flew to Washington to personally report to General Saville. I returned to the 1st Fighter Group to await further instructions.

    On December 9, 1951, I received a teletype message transferring me from the 1st Fighter Group to the Far East Air Forces Command. The date of my departure from the United States was set for December 15. After arriving in Japan, I was to report to General Weyland, Commander of the Far East Air Forces, to receive further instructions and assignments. So I flew from the United States to the Far East.

    The plane arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo at midnight on December 18. The next morning, I reported to the Far East Air Forces Command Liaison Office. The official in charge introduced us to two other officers, Major Sheffield and Major Chandler, who would be working with me. Both of them had been informed of the background of the bacteriological warfare plan in the United States, and they had arrived in Japan only one day before me. The Liaison Office arranged for us to meet with General Weyland that afternoon.

    When we met with General Weyland, he told us that he had received a classified order from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding the bacteriological warfare plan. He said that the instruction indicated that the F-86 aircraft would initially conduct bacteriological warfare on a smaller scale, which might be expanded later. He said that other types of aircraft, such as the B-26, would also participate, and the F-86 aircraft of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing would also contribute.

    General Weyland then discussed the bacteriological warfare plan with me from the perspective of the F-86 aircraft. He stated that he expected us to begin the experimental activities of bacteriological warfare as soon as possible. We would receive the tank-like bacterial containers airfreighted from Daegu, Korea. General Weyland said that he was arranging the necessary orders to send us to the Fifth Air Force and then to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. He told us that he had spoken to General Everest, Commander of the Fifth Air Force, on the phone, and that he would send us there to discuss our mission with General Everest in detail. General Everest would explain our mission to us in detail. He said that our responsibility was to ensure that these tasks were completed well.

    At the end of our meeting, General Weyland said that he was pleased to have spoken with us. His secretary then gave us the orders transferring us to the Fifth Air Force.

    On December 20, 1951, our plane landed at K-16 base (Seoul) at 3:00 PM. The three of us, Major Sheffield, Major Chandler, and I, took a jeep to the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force. When we reported to the office of General Everest, Commander of the Fifth Air Force, his secretary immediately took us to see the General.

    In the office, the General introduced himself and Colonel Myers, the Chief of Operations of the Fifth Air Force. The General had been waiting for our arrival, so he outlined to us what role the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing would play in the bacteriological warfare plan. He said that the three of us should participate in the normal work of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing as soon as possible. General Everest also said that he had notified Colonel Gabreski, Commander of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, that we were coming to him.

    General Everest then said that the Fifth Air Force was about to begin a limited bacteriological warfare campaign. Our task was to give briefings to the pilots when the Fifth Air Force gave us instructions. Until then, we should try to keep the plan secret. Soon after, we would receive orders from the Fifth Air Force to begin these attacks, so we should assist the Wing in making the necessary preparations.

    General Everest told us that this plan involved both bombers and fighter aircraft under his command. These attacks would be on an experimental basis but had the potential for expansion. Since the capacity of each type of aircraft to carry insects was different, the instructions for each wing would also be different. The insects used would be flies, fleas, and mosquitoes, all infected with germs such as malaria, typhoid, plague, and dysentery.

    Colonel Myers then said that an ordnance team consisting of an officer and several soldiers would be sent to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing to instruct our ordnance personnel on the operating procedures of the tank-like bacteriological containers, but after the initial few missions, we would have to handle any problems that arose ourselves. Colonel Myers said that the tank-like bacteriological containers used for the F-86 aircraft would be shipped to us from Daegu, as there was a facility for distributing bacteriological weapons there. Colonel Ferguson, in charge of the Materiel Division of the Fifth Air Force, would be responsible for transporting these weapons to us, and he would also be responsible for transporting other bacteriological weapons to the wings participating in the bacteriological warfare plan. There were also trained personnel in Daegu.

    In the early stages of these missions, we could expect to receive instructions with the special word "Maple." The word "Special" would indicate that these were missions to drop bacteriological weapons. At the same time, we would also likely receive instructions by telephone.

    The areas subjected to these attacks would include all the major railway lines from Sinanju north to Namsidong and Huichon. The boundaries of this area extended south to the Chongchon River and north to the Yalu River. He added that some of these missions might even be carried out north of the Yalu River. From the grid coordinates specified in the operational orders, we would know when to carry out these missions north of the Yalu River.

    When General Everest spoke again, he said that the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing could be expected to begin missions to drop bacteriological bombs in the near future. The Far East Air Forces Command had only received the instructions for our part of the plan a few days earlier, and the staff of the Fifth Air Force had been busy arranging the specific details. He said that the scale of these missions had not yet been determined, but he believed that the general situation would be eight to ten missions per month.

    At the end of the meeting, General Everest said that if any pilots were unwilling to carry out this mission, we should emphasize that military court-martial power could be exercised in such cases.

    After General Everest finished speaking, we left his office.

    Walker M. Mahurin
    Colonel, U.S. Air Force
    Service Number 8658A
    North Korea, August 10, 1953

    The three of us, Major Sheffield, Major Chandler, and myself, arrived at K-13 base (Suwon) on December 20, 1951. When we reported to Colonel Gabreski, Commander of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, he assigned Major Sheffield to the 16th Fighter Squadron, Major Chandler to the 25th Fighter Squadron, and I was assigned to the Wing Headquarters to assist the Wing in carrying out the intended bacteriological warfare plan.

    That evening, Colonel Gabreski and I had a private conversation about the bacteriological warfare plan at our residence. Since General Everest had already told him the details of the plan, he did not need me to tell him anything more. We decided that the best way to implement the bacteriological warfare plan was to convene a meeting of several senior staff officers of the Wing and the Group as soon as possible to convey the details of the bacteriological warfare plan to them. Colonel Gabreski believed that the meeting should be limited to those key staff members in order to make appropriate decisions for implementing the plan while ensuring that the plan was not leaked.

    On December 22, 1951, the meeting was held at the Wing Headquarters. In addition to Colonel Gabreski, Major Sheffield, Major Chandler, and myself, the attendees included the following personnel: Lieutenant Colonel Jones, Commander of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Group, Major Wilson, Group Operations Officer, Major Wisner, Commander of the 25th Squadron, Major Coons, Commander of the 16th Squadron, Captain Cook, Wing Adjutant, and the Group Materiel Officer and Ordnance Officer, etc.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Colonel Gabreski introduced Major Sheffield, Major Chandler, and myself to the other officers present. Then he said: "We have received instructions from the Fifth Air Force to conduct a limited bacteriological warfare campaign. The people I have just introduced to you are here to help us carry out this plan. Colonel Mahurin will serve as the liaison officer between this Wing and the Fifth Air Force. He will tell you what you need to know."

    I then gave a brief instruction to the officers present on what General Everest and Colonel Myers had told me at the Fifth Air Force Headquarters. I talked about our receiving tank-like bacteriological containers from Daegu, and that in the near future, an ordnance team including an officer and several soldiers would come here to explain the handling procedures for the tank-like bacteriological containers to our ordnance personnel. I also said that we could expect to begin missions to drop bacteriological containers once we received instructions from the Fifth Air Force Headquarters. After that, the meeting entered into general discussion.

    It was decided during the meeting that the 16th Squadron would be used to implement this plan. When the ordnance team arrived from Daegu, the key ordnance personnel from the 16th and 25th Squadrons would receive training on the handling procedures for this type of tank-like bacteriological container. In addition, the meeting also decided that the pilots who would be involved in this plan would only be told that they were carrying an experimental tank and that the mission was secret. When we received instructions from the Fifth Air Force to conduct a briefing for all personnel, Captain Cook, the Wing Adjutant, would read the "Military Regulations," Major Chandler would report on the bacteriological warfare plan, and I would then explain the key points of the plan.

    On December 24, an ordnance team came to K-13 from Daegu to explain the installation of the tank-like bacteriological containers to the personnel selected from the 16th and 25th Squadrons. After these personnel received appropriate training, we were ready to carry out the first mission to drop bacteriological weapons.

    The mission directive we received on December 27 specified the mission of dropping bacteriological containers for the first time. The command was in the following form:

    Headquarters, Fifth Air Force
     December 28, 1951
    Subject: Daily Mission Directive.
    Issued to: Fourth Fighter-Interceptor Wing.
              Eighteenth Fighter-Bomber Wing.
              Forty-Ninth Fighter-Bomber Wing.
              Fifty-First Fighter-Interceptor Wing.
              Sixty-Seventh Tactical Reconnaissance Wing.
              One Hundred and Thirty-Sixth Fighter-Bomber Wing.
              Third Bomber Wing.
              Four Hundred and Fifty-Second Bomber Wing.
    From: Operations Section, Headquarters, Fifth Air Force.
    Paragraph 1:
    The Fifty-First Fighter-Interceptor Wing is to dispatch twenty-four F-86 aircraft, whose call sign is "Maple," to escort twenty-four F-84 aircraft, whose call sign is "Jerl," attacking railway targets, as specified below:
    Mission Number  Number of Aircraft  Time of Arrival Over Target  Target Area
    5101　Twenty-four　  0830　  XE4050
    5102　Twenty-four　  1330　  YD4312
    In addition, dispatch four F-86 aircraft, whose call sign is "Special Maple," to attack XE0102 in accordance with previous instructions. Four F-86 aircraft are to conduct runway alert.
        By order of Lieutenant General Everest
                Signature of Operations Officer, Headquarters, Fifth Air Force.

    Our first mission to drop bacteriological weapons was carried out in the Chongchon River area of North Korea, between Sinanju and Kunuri. Major Coons instructed that the aircraft carrying out the bacteriological warfare mission should fly with the rest of the aircraft until they approached the target area, then they should descend and drop the tank-like bacteriological containers in the designated area. After dropping, they should rejoin the other aircraft formation and patrol in the normal way.

    The pilots participating in the special mission, like the other pilots, participated in the normal briefing. After the normal briefing, these pilots were called aside, and the squadron leader told them that they would be carrying special experimental tanks. They were to drop the tank-like bacteriological containers in the designated area according to instructions. After returning to base, they were not allowed to talk about what they had done, nor were they allowed to talk about the tanks. The first bacteriological warfare mission was carried out according to plan.

    At the end of December, the Wing Intelligence Officer reported to Colonel Gabreski and me that he had heard small broadcasts about the bacteriological warfare plan and what the Wing was doing. It seemed that the pilots and soldiers did not have a definite opinion on this issue, but they had determined that the Wing was doing something unusual, because after the normal briefing, some pilots received special instructions. The Wing Intelligence Officer suggested that permission should be obtained from the Fifth Air Force to hold a large-scale briefing meeting to prevent the further spread of these small broadcasts about bacteriological warfare. We reported these facts to the Fifth Air Force and obtained permission to conduct a briefing for the Wing personnel. We then instructed the Wing Headquarters to order all Wing personnel to attend a meeting at the Wing Theater at 8:00 AM on January 2, 1952. Only the pilots would attend a meeting at 1:00 PM on January 3, 1952, and all pilots, aircraft mechanics, and ordnance personnel would attend a meeting at 8:00 AM on January 4, 1952.

    The first report on disciplinary issues prepared for all Wing personnel was held on January 2, 1952. Colonel Gabreski gave an opening speech, saying that he had noticed that small broadcasts were circulating throughout the Wing about the activities the Wing was engaged in. He said that these small broadcasts must stop. He went on to say that any small broadcast would eventually reach the ears of people who should not know anything about the Wing. Colonel Gabreski said that it was necessary to familiarize all Wing personnel once again with proper military ethics. In this regard, Captain Cook would read the "Military Regulations" to all relevant personnel. Colonel Gabreski said that he hoped this reading would remind all relevant personnel of the obligations they undertook as soldiers.

    Following this speech, Captain Cook read the "Military Regulations." When he finished reading, everyone stood at attention, and Colonel Gabreski left the meeting room.

    As planned, a speech was held for pilots only the next afternoon. After everyone had gathered, I gave a speech on the beginning of the bacteriological warfare plan.

    I began by saying that the general situation in Korea, both on the ground and in the negotiations, was a stalemate. Therefore, the only way to achieve a successful outcome was through air power. I told the pilots that instructions had been received from higher authorities to begin a bacteriological warfare campaign, and in fact, we had already started doing so. Higher authorities hoped that this method could influence the negotiations and produce a satisfactory outcome. At the same time, we could test this kind of warfare on an experimental basis. I told them that I could tell from their expressions that this news had taken them by surprise. However, this plan had to be carried out no matter what. I once again mentioned the issue of secrecy, especially that they should not talk about this issue among themselves, so as to prevent the news from being leaked out.

    The next morning, all the pilots, aircraft mechanics, and ordnance personnel gathered in the theater. Major Chandler gave a general overview of the bacteriological warfare plan, but did not touch on specific issues. After Major Chandler finished speaking, I spoke. I said that officers and soldiers were not allowed to discuss this plan with anyone.

    As for the tank-like bacteriological containers, I told them that the containers were filled with mosquitoes, fleas, and flies, all infected with germs such as malaria, typhoid, and plague.

    I said that I did not know how long this mission would last, but as long as they instructed us, we would have to carry it out.

    From January 10, 1952, we began to receive regular instructions from the Fifth Air Force Headquarters regarding missions to drop bacteriological weapons. While I was in the 51st Wing, we received an average of ten instructions per month for missions to drop bacteriological weapons, two or three of which specified that they were to be carried out north of the Yalu River. After each mission to drop bacteriological weapons was carried out, the pilots reported to the Intelligence Section where they had dropped the tank-like bacteriological containers. This report was then submitted to the Headquarters of the Fifth Air Force.

    The areas usually attacked were north of the Chongchon River, along the major supply lines from Sinanju to Namsidong and from Kunuri to Huichon. The areas attacked by the missions flying to the north of the Yalu River were areas not far north of Andong and Dadonggou. Due to the dangers involved, experienced pilots were assigned to the missions flying north of the Yalu River. In addition, for the aircraft carrying out these missions to drop bacteriological weapons, the Wing decided to turn off the IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) on the aircraft, so that enemy radar would not be able to detect them.

    The purpose of the missions to drop bacteriological weapons carried out south of the Yalu River was to fill the railway area with bacteria-carrying fleas, flies, and mosquitoes. As a result, the work of the workers trying to repair the railway was hindered. These suddenly appearing fleas, flies, and mosquitoes would make people panic, because it was abnormal for the season. The purpose of attacking near Andong and Dadonggou was to fill the area with bacteria, to prevent the transport of supplies from Northeast China to North Korea.

    After several missions to drop bacteriological weapons were dispatched, the 25th Squadron also began to carry out this type of mission. Usually, this type of mission specified that each aircraft should carry two tank-like bacteriological containers, with four aircraft in each small team, and sometimes eight aircraft were selected. The small team carrying bacteriological weapons flew together with the other aircraft carrying out ordinary missions. After the small team carrying bacteriological weapons descended and dropped the tank-like bacteriological containers, they rejoined the other aircraft and patrolled the combat area.

    During my time of service in the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, I carried out a total of thirty-eight flight missions, four of which were missions to drop bacteriological weapons. I led a mission to drop bacteriological weapons on March 15, 1952.

    The day before the flight, Lieutenant Colonel Jones, the Group Commander, asked me if I would be willing to be the leader of a mission the next morning. I said that I would. The Group Operations Section had received instructions to carry out the mission, which specified that we dispatch twenty-four F-86 aircraft to carry out escort patrol work, and dispatch four F-86 aircraft to carry out bacteriological weapons attacks.

    Early in the morning on the day the mission was dispatched, I learned from the Headquarters of the Fifth Air Force that the F-80 and F-84 fighter-bombers had been concentrating their efforts on bombing the main railway line going north from Sinanju. This bombing had been going on for several weeks, but the Fifth Air Force believed that someone was repairing this railway at night. The Fifth Air Force decided to drop tank-like bacteriological containers in the area north of Sinanju to dampen the morale of the road repair workers and hinder the repair work.

    If the workers fell ill as a result, it would be equivalent to reducing the number of road repair workers.

    According to standard briefing procedures, after all the officers who were supposed to participate in listening to the briefing had gathered in the briefing room, I entered the briefing room, everyone stood at attention, and the Intelligence Officer began the briefing. The first part of the briefing included an overview of the activities of other Wing aircraft that would be operating in the same combat area as us: the F-80 aircraft and F-84 aircraft would be dive-bombing the railway line in that area. After the Intelligence Officer finished the briefing, I stepped forward to brief the personnel carrying out this mission.

    I told the pilots that we would take off in small teams of four aircraft each, with a one-minute interval between the takeoff times of each small team. The small team I led would take off first, and the rest would follow us. Other than my small team, the other small teams should fly directly to the mouth of the Yalu River, should stay on the south side of the river, and should patrol back and forth from east to west and from west to east between the mouth of the river and the Supung Reservoir. I said that after my small team completed the mission of dropping bacteriological weapons, we would join the other aircraft to conduct patrol flights.

    After the main briefing, I gathered my small team personnel and gave them a summary of what we were going to do. As we flew north over Pyongyang and over Sinanju, we began to descend towards the target. I would drop the tank-like bacteriological containers that I was carrying, and then my wingman should slowly count from one to ten. After counting to ten, he should drop his tank-like bacteriological containers. When I saw my wingman drop his bacteriological weapons, I would call the leader of the sub-team to descend and drop bacteriological weapons. At the same time, I would climb high to cover him. After he and his wingman dropped the tank-like bacteriological containers, they should climb high and join us to form a formation.

    This mission was carried out according to plan, and our small team carried out the mission in the manner I had instructed. We did not know the results of the attack, but we knew where the tank-like bacteriological containers had been dropped. We encountered intense ground anti-aircraft fire. After we landed and returned all the flight equipment, we gathered in the Intelligence Section briefing room. We reported where the tank-like bacteriological containers had been dropped and marked them on the map. An intelligence clerk recorded the information presented by the pilots, and after listening to the reports of all the pilots, he integrated them into a report summarizing the overall activity of the mission.

    All missions to drop bacteriological weapons were almost the same as the format I have described. The only difference was the different target areas selected.

    美国空军第四战斗截击机联队第四战斗截击机大队大队长上校瓦克·麦·马胡林的供词
    我的名字叫瓦克·麦·马胡林，军号8658A，一九一八年十二月五日生于密执安州培敦港。我是一个美国空军上校，又是一个航空工程学士。
    二次世界大战服现役后，我回到美国，军阶是一个中校。当时，被指派为美国空军总部采购处战斗机计划官。我继续在战斗机采购处工作，并成为战略空军处战斗机科科长。约在一九五○年六月，我被派到空军部部长办公室任行政助理。
    依照美国空军总部的传统习惯，我们那些在部长办公室工作的人员都必须获得一种关于我们是否可靠的安全证明书，因为我们的职位要求我们是这种可以被信任的人。联邦调查局对我的可靠性作了一次调查，我被认为是可以被信任的，并获得了一种“M”级证明书，“M”级证明书比“绝密”级证明书还高。
    我第一次获得一些关于细菌战的知识，是在一九五○年十一月，当时我奉我的上级空军部长办公室副主任蒂尔上校的指示，去参观马里兰州佛烈德利克的狄特里克兵营。
    蒂尔上校对我说：空军方面正在狄特里克兵营进行实验，以确定用飞机携带及投掷细菌武器的最好方法，我们所以进行这一切的实验都是为了要制造一种适当类型的细菌弹，这种弹正好装有一定成分的炸药和带菌物质，以便在该弹触地爆炸后，弹中的带菌物依然活着，从而可以在该地造成危险性的后果。
    蒂尔上校指出：高级军事领袖们如参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷将军，空军参谋长范顿伯将军，陆军参谋长柯林斯将军和海军作战部长薛尔曼将军，都认为细菌武器既有效，又便宜，故应该加以发展，使其在武器这个范畴中，占有一定的地位。虽然朝鲜战争在当时正在顺利地进行，但是将来是不可能预料的，因此，由于未来局势之难以确定，细菌战计划正进入试验、发展阶段。
    蒂尔上校说：空军高级当局，包括空军部长芬勒特先生和空军参谋长范顿伯将军拟定了的一项政策，即：从美国空军总部内选派一些军官去熟悉一下狄特里克兵营的工作。根据此项政策，我们办公室有好几位军官都要去参观那个兵营。习惯上，空军往往使它的军官熟悉一下新的计划，以便在将来，一旦这些计划受到重视时，他们就会大略地知道上级在考虑些什么。蒂尔上校说，在狄特里克所研究的是能为各种类型的轰炸机，如B—26、B—29、B—50等所携带的细菌弹。蒂尔上校还说，他愿意听取我对于狄特里克正在进行的工作的意见，因为他知道我过去在战斗机方面是有些经验的。蒂尔上校认为应该作一番努力去考虑战斗机如何能够携带和投掷细菌弹。
    蒂尔上校对我强调说：这项计划被认为是“绝密性”的。狄特里克的研究工作是在极端秘密的情况下进行的。
    我是在一九五○年十一月中旬去访问马里兰州佛烈德利克的狄特里克兵营的。我的证件在门前被检查后，便有一向导带领我参观该研究中心。
    兵营为陆军军械兵团和化学兵团所有，并受它们的管辖，空军占据了其中一部分，而其他部分则由陆军使用。该兵营由陆军方面指挥。在佛烈德利克的空军单位是在美国空军总部掌管器材的副参谋长办公室的领导之下，当时掌管器材的副参谋长是沃尔夫中将。
    兵营中雇用了非军事人员担任各种职务。这些人都是受过良好训练的技术人员，实际工作全由他们担任，除此以外，还有秘书人员。
    该研究中心设有一巨大钢制圆球，直径据我估计有六十呎。该圆球构造坚固，有双层墙壁，内外两层之间相隔一定的距离；圆球周围相隔一定距离有安着打不碎的厚玻璃的小窗数处；球的周围有若干小门，可以由此用唧筒抽出球中的空气作为样品。球底有一座深重的大门，可以通进球内，以便进行装置。在球的外墙上装有一条围绕圆球的窄狭的人行道，可供人从窗口向内观察，并便于抵达小门，抽出空气作为样品。
    圆球的目的是为研究中的武器提供一个进行试验爆炸的地方。爆炸后，从球内抽出的空气样品可以显示出还活着多少可以引起危害作用的弹内物。
    当时兵营正在研究一种为B—29型飞机用的细菌弹。该弹约长十八吋，直径二吋半。弹尾有若干小的尾翼，以保证落地准确。他们的企图是要由轰炸机携带若干由许多枚这种小的细菌弹所装成的细菌弹簇。当投掷它们时，它们就会散开并分布在广大的面积上。
    我曾见过在圆球内对一枚这种细菌弹所进行的试验爆炸。该弹是用金属线被悬挂在球的正中心的，以便使之能与球之各边距离相等。参与试验的人员都守候在圆球外面周围的各个小洞口边，准备抽取空气样品。在一个适当的时间便用电气设备使该弹爆炸。弹片落在球底，弹内物遂散布到空气中。然后，抽取空气样品，再将样品送至附近的实验室里以判明爆炸后在圆球里还存在着多少没有受到损害的弹内物。此后可将动物放进球中，以确定爆炸后弹内物所能产生之致命效果。
    这种实验之目的是要发现最适合于这种用途的细菌弹之大小与形状。进行试验也是为了发现最适合于用来作弹壳的材料，如钢、铝、电木等。显然，炸毁弹壳所需要的爆炸力愈小，则能够生存下来的弹内物愈多。他们曾改用过多种制造弹壳的材料，以使这种弹能够很容易地爆炸而不致于杀死所有的弹内物。
    紧接着圆球所在的建筑物附近有一所实验室。化验人员在这里检验从球中抽出来的空气样品。此外，试验用的弹内物也保存在实验室里。实验室所保存之弹内物，在形式上与细菌相类似，用这种弹内物进行试验所获得的效果可大体上显示用细菌时所能得到的效果。试验之前由实验室人员将这种物放入试验炸弹中。当处置带菌物的时候，实验室人员总是穿着厚的防护衣。
    与这个单位有关的还有几所保暖花房。大约有三、四所这种房子，我估计每一所有六十呎长，二十四呎宽。这些保暖花房是用来培养各种农作物上所能找到的真菌。这种真菌集中在保暖花房里以便用来做试验。可以用这种真菌来作为携带危害庄稼的细菌物。在这里所讲的细菌的用途是使庄稼凋萎和死亡，或减少各种庄稼的收成。在保暖花房中植有各种蔬菜。但是，正在试验中的这种细菌能破坏各种庄稼。
    在我参观的房屋周围，有几大片空旷之地，用来判定飞机投弹后，自然气候对于在该处空气中的各种不同生物的影响。在这种情况下，细菌弹爆炸后，就从离开爆炸中心各个不同距离的地方拿取空气样品。风和气温的影响，以及散布作用都可以用这种方法来予以发现。这种试验在每一个细节上都会弄得精确。
    实验用的细菌弹本身是在研究中心制造的，一旦研究中心确定了（细菌弹）最好的设计以后，就可以大规模制造。
    参观完毕时，我的向导告诉我说：他们正在研究各种各样的细菌。这种细菌可以造成一种有害于人类、动物及庄稼的影响。他说所期望的结果，是引起疾病以及削弱工作和战斗能力。
    我问我的向导，是否也考虑过用战斗机来做这种工作。他告诉我说：研究工作还没有进展到这一地步，目前他们只进行关于轰炸机的装备的研究工作。他还说：一旦接到指示后，他们也可以很便当地研究战斗机使用同样类型的细菌弹的可能性。
    第二天，当我回到五角大楼去办公时，我便向蒂尔上校汇报说：我已按照他的指示去参观了一次。他问我从战斗机的角度出发，我对于兵营中所进行的工作有何看法。我告诉他说，我所看到的为研究中心到目前为止所研究出来的细菌弹，并不适用于高速喷气式飞机。蒂尔上校说：假如用战斗机来携带这类武器，那么它们的潜力就会增加。我们两人都不认为这将是太困难的。
    几天后的一个上午，蒂尔上校打电话叫我到芬勒特先生的办公室去会见他。他说部长要听取狄特里克兵营中的情况。当我和蒂尔上校到达部长办公室时，蒂尔上校作发言人，并做了一个关于狄特里克兵营活动情况的一般概述。部长很注意地倾听蒂尔上校所讲的话。蒂尔上校转述了我的观察，即：似乎没有考虑到要使用战斗机一事，虽然要把战斗机使用在这方面，并不是一件很困难的事情。部长是一位沉默寡言的人，他说，他很高兴能够听到我们的意见。他说，这种意见证实了他过去对这件事的想法，事实上他已和范顿伯将军讨论过这点。他还说，范顿伯将军对他声言空军参谋部在考虑着这件事情，而且在最近的将来，应该会作出某种决定。当蒂尔上校结束了他的汇报后，部长对于我们向他提供情况一事，致以谢意，于是我们便离开了他的办公室。
    我在一九五一年二月升为上校，四月间被任命为驻在美国加利福尼亚州威克多维尔的第一战斗截击机大队的大队长。
    在一九五一年十月的最后一个星期，我接到一件发自美国空军总部、并用电传打字机传来的通知，命令我立即向萨韦尔少将报到，他在美国空军掌管作战部的副参谋长手下工作。当我向萨韦尔少将报到时，卡伦准将和麦克尼克尔上校也均被召入他的办公室。
    萨韦尔将军主持这个会议，他说：“范顿伯将军命令将七十五架F—86E型飞机运往朝鲜以替换第五十一战斗截击机联队的F—80型飞机。你，马胡林，和你，麦克尼克尔，将负责此项计划。”萨韦尔将军解释说：这些飞机的用途和在朝鲜进行的细菌战计划有关。
    萨韦尔将军说：已经从国防部和参谋长联席会议方面的高级当局接到指示要在朝鲜进行一次有限度的细菌战战役。这项指示已通过空军参谋长范顿伯将军的办公室，送到美国空军掌管作战部的副参谋长之处。空军参谋长办公室接到此全部计划后，遂分为几个部分，分别送交各参谋部门以采取适当的措施。当时，仅有几个人知道此项计划的全貌。
    细菌战计划的目标是要在朝鲜实际战场的情况下使用此类武器，以试验其效果。此外，在朝鲜战争中，使用此种武器的规模，也可能根据以后的情况，予以扩大。不同类型飞机所能携带的容器均将予以试验，并且将在各种不同的地形上及在各种不同气候下投掷此类武器。同时，有人希望谈判可能会受到此计划的影响，从而可能产生一个满意的结果。当时，空军已为F—86型飞机制造出一种挂在翼下的能携带染有各种病菌的昆虫的、有如一个油箱的容器。这种油箱式的容器将由第五十一战斗截击机联队在实际作战的情况下予以试验。
    F—86E型飞机之所以被运往第五十一战斗截击机联队，是因为这种飞机较旧式的F—86A型飞机的性能为好，可以干得更好些。萨韦尔将军并说：命令已送至全美国各个单位去调F—86E型飞机及其人员到加利福尼亚州阿拉美达海军航空站，以便运到朝鲜去。麦克尼克尔上校和我将负责在规定的启运日期前使一切都准备就绪。这项调运工作开始后，我们就有义务要使萨韦尔将军能知道有关情况。
    萨韦尔将军说明道：在此计划中麦克尼克尔上校所负责的部分将在飞机运离美国后结束。但是，在这次调运工作完成后，我将得到命令把我调往朝鲜。他并说，我于到达日本东京后得去向远东空军司令威兰将军报到。他提到将有两名军官约在同一时间内被派往国外，人员尚未选定，我将在日本或朝鲜会见他们。
    当萨韦尔将军结束会议时，他提醒麦克尼克尔上校和我，要我们注意保密，并要求我们千万不要把他所告诉我们的关于细菌战的计划告诉别人。
    飞机和人员的调运工作定于一九五一年十一月五日完成，所以我约定于十一月四日在阿拉美达会同麦克尼克尔上校进行检查。
    一九五一年十一月四日我到达阿拉美达海军航空站。麦克尼克尔业已在前一天晚上自华盛顿来到那里，他正在那儿等我。我们立即开始进行检查。当然只有我们两个知道细菌战的计划及其背景。当我们检查完毕后，即向萨韦尔将军发出一封电传打字电报，报告检查结果，麦克尼克尔上校即乘飞机赴华盛顿亲自向萨韦尔将军汇报。我则回到第一战斗机大队等候下一步的指示。
    在一九五一年十二月九日我接到一封电传打字电报，将我从第一战斗机大队调到远东空军司令部去。规定我从美国动身的日期是十二月十五日，到达日本后，我得向远东空军司令官威兰将军处报到，以接受进一步的指示和任务。我于是乘飞机自美国前赴远东。
    飞机在十二月十八日午夜到达东京羽田机场，我于第二天早晨向远东空军司令部交际处报到。该处负责官员将我们介绍给另外两位军官，一位是谢菲尔少校，一位是昌德勒少校，他们将和我在一起工作。他们两位都是在美国就被告知关于细菌战计划的背景的，并且他们只比我早一天抵达日本。交际处替我们安排，于该日下午会见威兰将军。
    当我们会见威兰将军时，他对我们说，他业已接到美国参谋长联席会议关于细菌战计划的密令。他说，该指示表示F—86型机，在初期时，将在较小的规模上进行细菌战，以后有可能要予以扩大。他说，其他类型的飞机，如B—26型机亦将参予进来，而第五十一战斗截击机联队的F—86型机亦将出一分力。
    威兰将军接着从F—86型机的角度来和我谈关于细菌战的计划。他声称他期望我们尽早开始进行细菌战的试验性活动，我们将领到自朝鲜大邱空运来的油箱式细菌容器。威兰将军说：他正派人在办理那些把我们派往第五航空队及再由此派往第五十一战斗截击机联队去的必要命令。他告诉我们他已和第五航空队司令官埃弗雷斯特将军在电话中通话，并且说，他将把我们派往那里去和埃弗雷斯特将军面谈。埃弗雷斯特将军将会对我们详尽地说明我们的任务。他说我们的责任就是要保证好好地完成这些任务。
    在我们的会谈结束时，威兰将军说，他能和我们谈话使他感到很愉快。他的秘书于是把调我们到第五航空队去的命令交给了我们。
    一九五一年十二月二十日，我们的飞机于下午三时在K—16基地（汉城）降落。我们三人，谢菲尔少校、昌德勒少校和我乘吉普车到第五航空队司令部。当我们向第五航空队司令官埃弗雷斯特将军办公室报到时，他的秘书立即带我们去见将军。
    在办公室里将军介绍了他自己，并介绍了第五航空队作战处长麦耶斯上校。将军早已在等候着我们的到来，他于是对我们概述了关于第五十一战斗截击机联队将在细菌战计划中起些什么作用。他说我们三人应尽快地参与第五十一战斗截击机联队的普通工作。埃弗雷斯特将军又说他已经通知第五十一战斗截击机联队司令官加布里斯基上校说我们要到他那里去。
    埃弗雷斯特将军于是说：第五航空队即将开始一个有限度的细菌战役。我们的任务是当第五航空队给我们指示时，便由我们来向驾驶员们作简令。在此之前，我们尽量要使计划保密。不久之后，我们就将接到第五航空队的命令，要我们开始这种攻击，故我们应协助联队做好必要的准备工作。
    埃弗雷斯特将军告诉我们说：此计划关系到在他指挥下的轰炸机和战斗机。这种攻击将在一种试验性的基础上，但有扩大的可能。由于各型飞机携带昆虫的容量各有不同，故对各联队之指令亦将不同。所用的昆虫将为苍蝇、跳蚤和蚊子，它们都染有疟疾、伤寒、鼠疫和痢疾等病菌。
    麦耶斯上校接着说：由一位军官和数名士兵所组成的军械组将会被派到第五十一战斗截击机联队来指导我们的军械人员有关油箱式细菌容器之操作程序，但在最初数次任务之后，如果发生什么问题的话，都必须由我们自己来处理。麦耶斯上校说：F—86型机所用的油箱式细菌容器，将自大邱运给我们，因为那里设有分配细菌武器的设备。在福格逊上校指挥下的第五航空队器材处将负责把这种武器运送给我们，该处也将负责把其他细菌武器运送至参加细菌战计划的各联队中去。在大邱也有经过训练的人员。
    在这些任务的初期阶段，我们可预期收到上有特殊枫树”字样的指令。“特殊”这个字眼即表明这些是投掷细菌武器的任务。同时，我们还很可能在电话中接到指示。
    受到这种攻击的地区将包括从新安州北至南市洞和熙川的各主要铁路线。此地区之边界，南到清川江，北迄鸭绿江。他补充说：这些任务有的还可能将到鸭绿江以北去执行。从作战命令中所指定的方格座标来看，我们便能知道什么时候要执行这种到鸭绿江以北去的任务。
    当埃弗雷斯特将军再次发言时，他说第五十一战斗截击机联队，在最近的将来，可望开始投掷细菌弹的任务。远东空军司令部在几天前才收到计划中关于我们这部分的指令，第五航空队的参谋人员一直在忙于安排具体细节。他说，这些任务之规模尚未决定，但他认为一般情况是每月执行八至十次。
    会谈结束时，埃弗雷斯特将军说：若有驾驶员不愿执行此项任务时，我们须强调在这种情况下，可以行使军法审判的权力。
    当埃弗雷斯特将军结束谈话后，我们就离开了他的办公室。

    一九五三年八月十日于北朝鲜
    我们三个人，即谢菲尔少校、昌德勒少校和我本人，于一九五一年十二月二十日到达K—13基地（水原）。当我们向第五十一战斗截击机联队司令官加布里斯基上校报到时，他将谢菲尔少校派到第十六战斗机中队，将昌德勒少校派到第二十五战斗机中队，而我本人则被派到联队司令部，以协助联队执行拟意中的细菌战计划。
    当天傍晚，加布里斯基上校和我在我们的住所内进行了一次关于细菌战计划的私人谈话。因为埃弗雷斯特将军已经告诉了他关于此次计划的细节，所以他毋需乎我再去告诉他更多的情况，我们决定执行细菌战计划的最好办法就是尽速召集联队和大队的几个高级参谋军官举行一次会议，向他们传达细菌战计划之细节。加布里斯基上校认为会议应仅限于那几个主要的参谋人员，以便能做出执行该计划的适当决定，而同时保证计划不致于被泄露出去。
    一九五一年十二月二十二日，会议在联队司令部举行。除了加布里斯基上校、谢菲尔少校、昌德勒少校和我本人以外，参与会议者还有下列各人员，即：第五十一战斗截击机大队长琼斯中校、大队作战官威尔逊少校、第二十五中队长魏斯纳少校、第十六中队长孔斯少校、联队副官库克上尉以及大队器材官和军械官等。
    会议开始时，加布里斯基上校向其他出席的军官介绍了谢菲尔少校，昌德勒少校和我本人。然后他称：“我们从第五航空队得到指示，要我们进行一次有限度的细菌战役。我方才向你们介绍过的人，就是来帮助我们执行这项计划的。马胡林上校将担任本联队和第五航空队之间的联络官。他会把你们需要知道的事情告诉你们。”
    我遂即将埃弗雷斯特将军和麦耶斯上校在第五航空队司令部所告诉我的事情向在场的军官做了简短的指示。我谈到我们要从大邱取得油箱式细菌容器，并且在不久的将来，将有一个包括一名军官和数名士兵的军械组要到这里来，以给我们的军械人员讲解关于油箱式细菌容器的处理程序。我又说，我们可以预期在一旦从第五航空队司令部得到指示后，我们就得开始执行投掷细菌容器的任务。此后，会议遂进入一般的讨论。
    会议中决定将用第十六中队来执行此项计划。当军械组从大邱到达时，第十六及第二十五中队的主要军械人员都要去接受关于此种油箱式细菌容器之处理程序的训练。此外，会议还决定那些将与此项计划发生关系的驾驶员，将仅被告诉他们要携带一种试验性质的油箱，并说，任务是秘密的。当我们从第五航空队得到指示要我们向全体人员进行传达时，则将由联队副官库克上尉宣读“军事法规”，昌德勒少校将报告关于细菌战的计划，而我将接着讲解此计划之要点。
    十二月二十四日，一个军械组从大邱来到了K—13，以给那些从第十六中队及第二十五中队内挑选出来的人员讲解关于油箱式细菌容器的安装工作。这些人员得到适当训练后，我们便对于执行第一次投掷细菌武器的任务有了准备。
    我们于十二月二十七日所接到的任务指令第一次规定了投掷细菌容器的任务，命令形式如下：
    第五航空队司令部
     一九五一年十二月二十八日
    命令事项：每日之任务指令。
    命令发至：第四战斗截击机联队。
              第十八战斗轰炸机联队。
              第四十九战斗轰炸机联队。
              第五十一战斗截击机联队。
              第六十七战术侦察联队。
              第一百三十六战斗轰炸机联队。
              第三轰炸机联队。
              第四百五十二轰炸机联队。
    命令来自：第五航空队司令部作战处。
    第一段：
    由第五十一战斗截击机联队出动二十四架F—86型飞机，其呼号为“枫树”，去为呼号为“杰尔”的攻击铁路目标的二十四架F—84型飞机进行护航，规定如下：
    任务号码  飞机架数  到达目标上  目标区
                        上空的时间
    五一○一　二十四　  ○八三○　  XE四○五○
    五一○二　二十四　  一三三○　  YD四三一二
    除此之外，另派四架F—86型飞机其呼号为“特殊枫树”，按照以前之指示攻击XE○一○二。四架F—86型飞机则做跑道警戒。
        奉埃弗雷斯特中将之命
                第五航空队司令部作战官签名。
    我们第一次投掷细菌武器的任务是在北朝鲜清川江一带，从新安州到军隅里之间进行的。孔斯少校指示说：执行细菌战任务的飞机要与其余飞机同飞，直到它们接近目标区时为止，然后，它们应下降，在指定的地区内将油箱式细菌容器投下。投掷后，遂又加入其他飞机队形，并照普通方式进行巡逻。
    参加特殊任务的驾驶员，与其他驾驶员一样，都参加了正常的简令。正常简令后，遂将这些驾驶员叫至一旁，由小队长告诉他们，他们将携带特殊性质的试验油箱。他们要按照指示将油箱式细菌容器投于指定地区。回到基地后，不准谈论他们所做过的事情，也不准谈论油箱的事。第一次细菌战任务是按照计划进行的。
    在十二月末时，联队情报官向加布里斯基上校和我报告说：他已听到关于细菌战计划及联队正在进行的事情的小广播。似乎驾驶员和士兵们对此问题并没有一定的看法，但他们已确定联队正在进行着一种不寻常的事情，因为在正常简令后，有些驾驶员又接受了特殊指示。联队情报官建议应从第五航空队得到许可，举行一次大规模的传达会议，以杜绝此种关于细菌战的小广播之进一步流传。我们遂将这些事实报告给第五航空队，并得到了向联队人员作传达的许可。我们从而指示由联队司令部下命令要联队的全体人员于一九五二年一月二日晨八时在联队戏院开会，一九五二年一月三日下午一时仅驾驶员开会，一九五二年一月四日则全体驾驶员、飞机机工长、军械人员于晨八时开会。
    为全联队人员准备的关于军纪问题的第一次报告是在一九五二年一月二日举行的。加布里斯基上校致开幕词道：他已经注意到全联队内流传着关于联队所从事的活动的小广播。他说这些小广播必须停止。他继而说：任何小广播最后必然会传到那些根本不应该知道任何关于联队的事情的人们的耳朵里去。加布里斯基上校说：有必要使联队全体人员再次熟悉正当的军人品德。关于这一点，库克上尉将对全体有关人员宣读“军事法规”。加布里斯基上校说：他希望这次宣读会使得全体有关人员重新回忆一下他们作为军人所承担的义务。
    这段讲话以后，库克上尉就宣读了“军事法规”。当他读完以后，全体立正，加布里斯基上校就离开了会议室。
    依照计划，次日下午举行了一个只有驾驶员参加的讲话。所有的人都集合了以后，我便就细菌战计划的开端作了一次讲话。
    我开始时讲道：在地面上及在和谈中，朝鲜的一般形势就是一个僵局。因此，唯一能够取得一个成功的结局的办法就是用空中威力。我告诉驾驶员们说，已经接到高级当局的指令，必须开始发动一次细菌战役，并且事实上已经开始这样做了。高级当局希望通过这个办法能够影响和谈，并产生一个完满的结果。同时，我们也可以在实验性质的基础上来试验一下这种战争。我告诉他们，我从他们的表情可以看出这消息使他们大吃一惊。然而，无论如何也必须执行这个计划。我又一次提到保密问题，尤其是他们相互间不要谈到这个问题，以免消息泄露出去。
    第二天早晨，所有的驾驶员、飞机机工长和军械人员都在戏院里集合。昌德勒少校讲述了关于细菌战计划的一般概况，但并未涉及具体问题。昌德勒少校讲完以后，我讲。我说军官及士兵们都不准跟任何人讨论这个计划。
    至于油箱式细菌容器，我告诉他们说，容器里装有蚊子、跳蚤及苍蝇，都是染上疟疾、伤寒、鼠疫等病菌的。
    我说我不知道这种任务要进行多久，但是，只要他们指示我们，我们就得去执行。
    从一九五二年一月十日起，我们开始接到第五航空队司令部关于投掷细菌武器任务的定期指令。当我在第五十一联队时，我们平均每月接到十次投掷细菌武器任务的指令，其中二、三次规定要到鸭绿江以北去执行。在每次执行投掷细菌武器的任务后，驾驶员便向情报科汇报他们把油箱式细菌容器投于何处，这种汇报又上呈到第五航空队司令部去。
    通常所袭击的地区是清川江以北，沿着从新安州到南市洞以及从军隅里到熙川之间的主要供应线。飞到鸭绿江以北的任务所袭击的地区是安东和大东沟以北不远的地方。飞往鸭绿江以北的任务，由于其所包含的危险性，故均指派有经验的驾驶员去执行。此外，对于执行这些投掷细菌武器任务的飞机，联队决定将机上的敌友识别器关闭，让敌方的雷达不致于发现它们。
    在鸭绿江以南所执行的投掷细菌武器任务的目的是使铁路一带充满了带有细菌的跳蚤、苍蝇和蚊子。结果，就使企图修复铁路的工人们的工作受到阻碍。这些突然出现的跳蚤、苍蝇和蚊子，会使人们惊惶，因为在季节上说，这是反常的。袭击安东及大东沟附近的目的是要使该地充满了细菌，以防止由中国东北向北朝鲜运输物资。
    出动了几次投掷细菌武器的任务后，第二十五中队也开始执行这种任务了。通常这种任务每次规定每架飞机要携带两个油箱式细菌容器，每一小队有四架飞机，有时也挑定八架飞机。每次带细菌武器的小队都和其他执行普通任务的飞机一齐飞行。在携带细菌武器的小队下降并投掷了油箱式细菌容器后，他们再与其他飞机会合去巡逻战斗区域。
    我在第五十一战斗截击机联队服务的期间内，一共执行了三十八次飞行任务，其中四次是投掷细菌武器任务的。我在一九五二年三月十五日带领了一次投掷细菌武器的任务。
    飞行的前一天，大队长琼斯中校问我是否愿意在明晨担任一次任务的领队，我表示愿意。大队作战科已接到执行任务的指令，该指令规定我们出二十四架F—86型飞机担任护航巡逻工作，以及出四架F—86型飞机进行细菌武器的袭击。
    在任务出动那天的一清早，我从第五航空队司令部获悉F—80和F—84战斗轰炸机一直在集中力量轰炸从新安州北去的那条主要铁路线。这种轰炸已进行了好几个星期了，但第五航空队认为有人在晚间修复这条铁路。第五航空队决定在新安州以北的地区内投掷油箱式细菌容器，以打击修路工人的情绪，并阻挠修复工作。
    如果有工人因此而害病，那也就等于减少了修路工人的数量。
    按照标准的简令程序，当所有应参加听取简令的军官都已在简令室集合以后，我便进入简令室，大家立正，情报官遂开始简令。简令的第一部分包括概述一下将与我们同时在那个作战区域里活动的其他联队飞机的活动情况：F—80型飞机和F—84型飞机将会在对该地区内的铁路线作俯冲轰炸。情报官结束简令后，我便上前去对执行这次任务的人员进行简令。
    我告诉驾驶员们，我们将以四架飞机为一小队起飞，每小队的起飞时间间隔一分钟。我带领的小队将首先起飞，其余的跟着我们起飞。除了我的小队外，其他小队都应直接飞到鸭绿江口，应保持在江的南边，并应在江口和水丰蓄水池间，从东到西，再从西到东来回巡逻。我说在我的小队完成投掷细菌武器的任务后，我们将会合其他飞机一齐去作巡逻飞行。
    主要的简令结束后，我便召集我的小队人员并把我们要做的事提纲挈领向他们作了指示。当我们飞过平壤以北，并越过新安州上空后，我们即开始向目标下降。我将投掷我所携带的油箱式细菌容器，然后，我的僚机便应慢慢地从一数到十，数到十以后，他便应投下他的油箱式细菌容器。当我看见我的僚机投完他的细菌武器后，我将叫小分队长下降投掷细菌武器。同时，我将爬高替他作掩护。在他和他的僚机投完油箱式细菌容器后，他们便应爬高和我们会合编成队形。
    这一次任务按照计划执行，我们的小队也依我所指示的方式执行了任务。我们不知道袭击的结果如何，但我们知道油箱式细菌容器投在什么地方。我们曾遇到强烈的地面高射炮火。在我们着陆并把所有的飞行装备交还后，我们便在情报科汇报室中集合。我们汇报了油箱式细菌容器投在何处，并把它们标志在地图上。有一个情报文书把驾驶员所呈述的情况纪录下来，并在听完所有驾驶员的汇报后，便把它们综合成为这次任务的活动总情况的报告。
    所有的投掷细菌武器的任务和我所谈的形式差不多是一样的。唯一的不同就是所选择的目标地区之不同而已。

                      军号八六五八A
              一九五三年八月十日于北朝鲜
    大约一九五二年三月十六日，我被任命为驻于K—14基地（金浦）的第四战斗截击机大队的大队长，我将大队人员作了一次我认为必要的调整。
    到此时，第四战斗截击机联队人员业已听到关于细菌战计划的小广播，他们所听到的不仅是关于第五十一战斗截击机联队，而且也有关其他联队在该计划中所起的作用。驾驶员们在休假时或在其他地方彼此见面后，便谈论此问题。一般地说，人们都知道正在进行着这种事情，但没有人知道其详情。第四战斗截击机联队司令官泰恩上校曾特别问过我此问题，我尽可能地把能够告诉他的事情告诉了他，因为我想到我曾经答应过埃弗雷斯特将军和麦耶斯上校我将保守秘密。当联队中其他人员问到我关于细菌战的问题时，我都告诉他们我是不能谈论此事的。
    三月二十七日泰恩上校告诉我说，我们两人要尽快地去见新被任命的第五航空队作战处长麦逊上校。
    在麦逊上校的办公室里，我们三人讨论了关于第四战斗截击机联队开始进行细菌战计划的问题。麦逊上校首先发言说：“马胡林，我晓得你知道细菌战计划与第五十一联队的关系的，因为你曾经在那里。”然后他又转向泰恩上校说：“你还没有正式知道此事，因此我将尽量将我所能讲的细节告诉你。”麦逊上校所讲的与从前埃弗雷斯特将军和麦耶斯上校所讲的很相似。
    所以要用第四战斗截击机联队的理由有几点：一个理由是，细菌战的规模将要扩大；另一个理由是高级当局认为为了在将来要全力进行细菌战的时候，第四战斗截击机联队要进行这种战争，所以它应该培养这种潜在的能力。
    细菌战任务的区域是要从平壤到鸭绿江以北，从海到山，从东到西。那些将到鸭绿江以北去执行的飞行任务，将到江的北面，去攻击沿江平行的目标地区。
    第五航空队之作战命令除规定普通任务之外，还将规定投掷细菌武器的攻击。既然第四战斗截击机大队的正规呼号为“约翰”，则此种投掷细菌武器任务的呼号即为“特殊约翰”。这也会在作战命令中出现。
    至于油箱式细菌容器的供应问题则为对第五十一战斗截击机联队所做的一样，将从大邱空运给我们。麦逊上校建议我们应派几个军械官及军械士到第五十一战斗截击机联队学习关于油箱式细菌容器的操作程序。这件事应该尽快地做到。麦逊上校本人将通知第五十一战斗截击机联队说明此批人员之前来及其目的。
    麦逊上校说：在今后的几天当中，我们可以期望要开始这种细菌战的攻击，所以要注意作战命令之变化。至于保密问题，麦逊上校说，他认为敌军无疑会晓得这种事情正在进行，虽然他没有任何证据，可是既然细菌战攻击已经进行了好几个月，敌人一定是会晓得的。然而，在朝鲜或日本还不是普遍地都晓得这件事，所以，向驾驶员们强调保密问题是很重要的。
    最后，麦逊上校说：我们可以期望每个月都将有几次要到鸭绿江以北去执行投掷细菌武器的任务，不过他在当时不能告诉我们这种任务将占什么比例。
    当我和泰恩上校回到K—14基地后，我们二人便讨论了执行此计划的最好办法。他说，他将进行必要的安排以使主要的军械人员到K—13基地去学习。这将包括三个中队的三个军械官以及每个中队中的五名最高级的士官，总共要去的人有十八名。我则应召集一次驾驶员会议，将此事告诉他们。从此以后，我们将建立一种课程以使从美国派到第四战斗截击机大队的驾驶员们知道此事。关于细菌战计划之讲课应在正规的讲课学校中与其他课程同时讲授。在以前上这个学校已经是一种既定程序，故现在所要作的仅是将细菌战一课列入课程表而已。
    一九五二年三月二十七日夜，我召集了一次必要的大队总部人员及三个中队长的参谋会议。参加的人员如下：
    库恩中校，副大队长；
    潘恩中校，大队作战官；
    利得兰中尉，大队情报官；
    马丁少校，第三三四中队长；
    阿麦尔少校，第三三五中队长；
    阿斯拉少校，第三三六中队长。
    经过大家的讨论之后，决定将投掷细菌武器任务之情况以下述方式告知驾驶员。首先，由大队情报官利得兰中尉报告关于保密事项，其次，则由我报告细菌战任务之详细情况以及计划中为我们单位所规定的大概任务。大家也一致同意应由三个中队长在中队作战室内给驾驶员们作补充指示，讲关于服从高级司令部命令之必要性。
    次日，即一九五二年三月二十八日晨九时，在大队简令室内举行了为驾驶员而举行的大规模简令。我猜想参加的共约有一百名驾驶员。我所强调的一点就是无论我们的感觉如何，都要执行我们被指定的这些投掷细菌武器的任务。轮到那个人执行这种任务时，都不得找藉口规避。从那时起，第四战斗截击机联队遂开始参加了细菌战计划。
    大约在一九五二年三月三十日，我们接到第五航空队给我们的第一次投掷细菌武器任务的指示。我们用“特殊约翰”作为投掷细菌武器任务的呼号。
    每月我们收到大约十五次关于投掷细菌武器任务的指示，其中有四、五次的目标是在鸭绿江以北之中国东北地区。
    总的来说，在北朝鲜的投掷细菌武器任务的活动范围是一个长方形的地区，西面以大海，东面以高山，南面以平壤，北面以鸭绿江为界。第五航空队所指划的目标地区是新义州、定州、宣川和南市洞这几个城市之间的主要供应路线沿线一带。攻击的目标是使沿铁路线这个区域充满了带菌的跳蚤、苍蝇和蚊子，以阻止铁路的修复工作。
    至于到中国东北执行细菌战任务，大多是在鸭绿江北边，沿江边平行的地区内，有一两次是到沈阳南面不远的地区去的。到中国东北去执行任务时，每架飞机携带一个油箱式的细菌容器和一个普通的翼下油箱。这些任务的目的是使该区充满了带菌昆虫，阻止供应品输入朝鲜，以及破坏当地的工业活动。到沈阳去的任务的目的是试验F—86型飞机在这种情况下的最大航程，同时在那一带投掷带菌跳蚤、苍蝇和蚊子，以破坏工业活动。
    我在第四战斗机联队的期间，我们总是由三个中队轮流执行这种投掷细菌武器的任务。
    头几次投掷细菌武器的任务执行完毕后，我们所收到的油箱式细菌容器就有所不同。从横面看，这些油箱式细菌容器接近于圆形，同时较普通油箱要稍为小一些。这种更改并没有影响到任务的执行，也没有影响到它们的操作程序。
    这些任务通常由四到八架飞机所组成的小队执行。油箱式细菌容器投下以后，飞机就可以回升到高空，重新加入大队中的其余飞机进行巡逻。
    驾驶员们并不大乐于执行这种投掷细菌武器的任务，不过等到最初的那种厌恶心情消失后，他们都认识到不能不按照指示来执行这种任务。当然，去鸭绿江以北执行的任务是不受欢迎的，因为那是在中国大陆上空所进行的。
    大约在一九五二年四月二十三日，我接到第五航空队作战官麦逊上校给我的电话，叫我到汉城第五航空队司令部去报到。我按命令去报到。
    一开头，麦逊上校就说：埃弗雷斯特将军要第四战斗截击机大队向他报告在一切情况下，我们的飞机能够飞去并能折返基地的最远航程。麦逊上校解释说：将军是指在一切装弹及携油量的情况下，以及在实战情况下而言。
    收集这种材料的目的是使第五航空队手头存有备案。我提出，第四战斗截击机大队从来没有携带过炸弹，因此我没有那样的材料。麦逊上校在回答这个问题时说：他将使第四战斗截击机大队进行几次携带细菌弹的任务。他将指定新义州为我们第一次出击的目标，其他目标则以后指定。为执行这个任务，我们将携带一枚细菌弹和一个翼下油箱。他说：这种细菌弹业已制造出来，而且美国远东空军司令部已经指示由第四战斗截击机联队来执行试验投掷这类细菌弹的任务。麦逊上校说，我们执行投掷这类细菌弹的任务有两个目的。第一个目的自然是试验这种高空细菌弹。其次，我们也将能试验F—86型飞机在这种情况下的最远航程。
    在他最后的几句话中，麦逊上校说，细菌弹将属于那种内有格子的类型，它们装有带疟疾、伤寒和鼠疫的蚊子、跳蚤及苍蝇。细菌弹的操作及安装在飞机上的程序和油箱式细菌容器一样。我们应该努力尽快地把炸弹架装到飞机上去。他会进行安排使在每次任务出发之前，从大邱空运来适当数量的细菌弹。
    我回到K—14基地后，立刻把麦逊上校给我们的指示报告给泰恩上校。我们决定以第三百三十四中队来携带细菌弹。泰恩上校打电话给联队管理器材的军官，并授予他必要指示，领取炸弹架以使第三百三十四中队能完成其任务。我就和第三百三十四中队长马丁少校取得联系，通知他关于这个计划的一切。我指示他采取必要的步骤以准备进行这种出击，并且告诉他，他应把这件事通知中队的军械人员。
    一九五二年五月一日，马丁少校报告我说，全部飞机都已装上炸弹架，一切都准备好了。
    我把这个情况报告给泰恩上校，他又转告麦逊上校说一切都准备就绪。
    从五月三日以后，我们就开始接到关于投掷细菌弹任务的指示了。
    我在第四战斗截击机联队总共执行了五次投掷细菌武器的任务。在此，我将详细讲述我于一九五二年五月三日所参加的那次投掷细菌武器的任务。
    一九五二年五月二日二十时左右，我们收到第五航空队司令部来的任务指令，第一次要我们使用细菌弹，目标是新义州以南的地方。
    二十时半，大队作战科接到基地运输官的电话说：一架运输机在空中报告说，他们带了给第四战斗截击机大队的货物，到达K—14基地了。我得知这消息后，就指示马丁少校采取必要的措施，使他的军械人员准备好，一当细菌弹从运输机卸下来以后，立即就把第三百三十四中队的十二架F—86型飞机装好细菌弹。那样，我们就会有准备去执行第二天清晨的任务。
    简令是在一九五二年五月三日六时举行的。泰恩上校也在场，因为他将作为一个小队长而参加这次飞行。以下是尽我所能记忆的小队呼号及小队长名单：
    特殊约翰一小队——马胡林上校，大队长。
    特殊约翰二小队——库恩中校，副大队长。
    特殊约翰三小队——马丁少校，第三三四中队中队长。
    红约翰——阿斯拉少校，第三三六中队中队长。
    白约翰——基恩上尉，第三三六中队作战官。
    蓝约翰——韦伯上尉，大队作战官。
    黑约翰——阿麦尔少校，第三三五中队中队长。
    绿约翰——洛夫上尉，第三三五中队小队长。
    黄约翰——泰恩上校，联队长。
    狗约翰——柯柏莱少校，第三三四中队政务官。
    紫约翰——赖特萧上尉，第三三五中队小队长。
    首先，由利得兰中尉开始简令，他宣读与我们在战斗地区同时执行任务的其他联队的详细活动情况。接着我对大队作简令。
    我告诉驾驶员们，我们要以小队起飞，每小队间隔二分钟。所有小队都应向鸭绿江江口飞去。巡逻是在鸭绿江以南，来往于水丰蓄水池与黄海之间。如果遭遇敌机，则每架飞机都应随机应变。
    主要简令以后，我对装载细菌弹飞机的驾驶员做简令。目标区是新义州以南。细菌弹与五百磅普通炸弹相像，内分若干小格，每格装有带菌昆虫，其种类与油箱式细菌容器所携带者相同。一当细菌弹爆炸时，昆虫就从炸弹里出来，散布在目标周围一个广大的区域上。我说，我们将携带一个副油箱及一枚细菌弹。我们飞抵目标上空时，就应立即投下我们的细菌弹。投弹以后，应把各小队集合队形飞回K—14基地去。装载细菌弹的飞机的每个小队长，都须向他的小队作有关其所愿采取的轰炸路线的简令讲解。
    任务照计划起飞了。飞向目标的途中，有几个驾驶员的投弹设备发生了故障，故无意地把油箱及细菌弹在未到目标区上空就投下去了。一共有九枚细菌弹落在新义州城的附近。
    我们着陆后，到汇报室报告，把我们的活动情况告诉了情报官利得兰中尉。据最可能的判断，细菌弹是投在目标区了。精确的结果则很难判断，因为驾驶员不能看到细菌弹的爆炸。
    我在第四战斗截击机大队期间，所有大队所进行的投掷细菌武器的任务，都是跟上述情况类似。一九五二年五月十三日我被北朝鲜军隅里的高射炮火所击落，于是被朝鲜老百姓俘获。
