Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th:童庆发, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who escaped from special agent control, was handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 28th. 童庆发 escaped from Camp No. 27 on the 20th by taking advantage of being assigned to transport coal. After his application for repatriation took effect on the 21st, he was about to be repatriated together with thirteen other Korean and Chinese prisoners of war when, due to the fear caused by long-term persecution by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents, he temporarily stayed behind and was placed under isolation by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Later, he mustered up the courage again and applied for repatriation.

When 童庆发 returned to Panmunjom and accused the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents of persecuting prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations personnel and reporters from various countries, he cried out in grief and anger. He described how he was forcibly dragged by the U.S. military to a prisoner of war camp that did not directly repatriate prisoners of war and subjected to various forms of coercion. He said that during the "screening" forced by the U.S. military on Geoje Island in April last year, he risked his life to run to a prisoner of war camp that directly repatriated prisoners of war. But soon the U.S. military prisoner of war camp authorities "screened" again and forcibly dragged him to the so-called "refusal to repatriate" prisoner of war camp. A U.S. military officer held a pistol and forced him to provide the names of the prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camp who firmly demanded repatriation. When he refused to provide the names, he was severely beaten. The U.S. military officer later took out a blacklist and forced him to sign and put his fingerprints on it. After that, the Chiang Kai-shek agents often frightened him, saying: You betrayed your own people, and you will be executed when you go back. The agents also forced him to become a "squad leader," write blood oaths, and forcibly tattooed him four times in a row. Not long before moving from Jeju Island to Dongchang-ri, the agents forced him to tattoo the Kuomintang party emblem on his chest. When he refused to tattoo, he was caught by the agents and beaten in the police guard department for a day and a night. Finally, the agents dug a deep pit next to the toilet and threatened him that if he refused to tattoo, he would be buried alive. He was forced to tattoo the Chiang Kai-shek party emblem and forced to cut his finger and write a "guarantee" not to return to the country.

童庆发 said that after arriving in Dongchang-ri, the Kuomintang agents removed him from his "squad leader" position and sent people to monitor the actions of him and several other prisoners of war who had revealed their desire to return to the country. Recently, someone secretly told him that the special agent "brigade commander" Zhou Yucheng was preparing to kill them when they went out to listen to the explanation, and then burn the bodies with gasoline. He himself also heard Zhou Yucheng openly threaten that the 28th camp killed Zhang Zilong, and the Indians could not find the body. At most, they would catch a few people and put them in confinement for a few days before releasing them. 童庆发 was afraid that he would be killed before he could wait to hear the explanation, so he risked his life to escape from the camp and apply for repatriation.

童庆发 said that when it came to repatriation on the 22nd, his suspicion rose again, and he hesitated for a while and vaguely said that he wanted to go to a neutral country. However, that day, after he watched thirteen Korean and Chinese prisoners of war repatriated, he immediately regretted it. He thought, I have my parents and wife in my motherland, why should I travel across the ocean to a foreign country? Besides, everything in the prisoner of war camp was forced by the U.S. military and Chiang Kai-shek agents. So he asked to return to his country again.

To this day, 270 of our captured personnel, who were described by the U.S. side as "preferring suicide to repatriation," have broken through the control of special agents and returned.

    我方被俘人员一名逃出特务控制遣返归来
    【新华社开城二十八日电】逃出特务控制的中国人民志愿军被俘人员童庆发在二十八日由中立国遣返委员会遣交我方。童庆发是在二十日乘着被派去运煤的机会从二十七号营场逃出来的。二十一日他申请遣返生效以后，将要和另外的十三名朝中被俘人员一同遣返时，由于美蒋特务长期迫害所造成的疑惧，又暂时留下，由中立国遣返委员会隔离看管，后来再次鼓起勇气申请遣返。
    童庆发回到板门店向中立国人员和各国记者控诉美蒋特务迫害战俘的罪行时，悲愤得放声大哭，他叙述了自己被美军强拉到不直接遣返战俘营和受到种种威逼的经过。他说，去年四月在巨济岛美军强迫“甄别”时，他冒死跑到直接遣返战俘营中。但不久美军战俘营当局又再次“甄别”，把他强拉到所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘营。一个美国军官拿着手枪逼他供出战俘营中坚决要求遣返的战俘的名字，他不供，被毒打了一顿。美国军官后来拿出一张黑名单，强逼他在上面签名画押。以后，蒋匪特务就经常吓唬他：你出卖了自己人，回去就要杀头。特务又强迫他当“班长”，写血书，并连续四次在他身上强迫刺字。从济州岛迁来东场里前不久，特务又强迫他在前胸刺国民党党徽，他拒绝刺，又被特务抓到警备队部打了一天一夜。最后，特务们在厕所旁挖了一个深坑，恐吓他说，不肯刺就要活埋。他被迫刺了蒋匪党徽，又被迫割破手指写了不回国的“保证书”。
    童庆发说，到东场里后，国民党特务撤了他的“班长”职务，并派人监视他和另外几个透露了回国愿望的战俘的行动。最近，别人偷偷告诉他说，特务“大队长”周玉成准备在出去听解释时就把他们几个人干掉，然后用汽油把尸首烧毁。他自己也听到周玉成公开恐吓说，二十八号营场杀了张子龙，印度人找不到尸首，大不了捉几个人去坐几天禁闭就会放出来的。童庆发害怕自己不能等到听解释时就会被杀害，于是就冒死逃出营场申请遣返。
    童庆发说，当二十二日那天临到遣返时，他的疑惧心理重新抬头，一时犹豫不决，就含含糊糊说了要到中立国去。可是，那天当他目送十三名朝中被俘人员遣返后，便立刻懊悔起来。他想，在祖国有我的父母妻子，为什么要远涉重洋到外国去？何况在战俘营里的事情都是被美军和蒋匪特务硬逼着干的。于是他再次要求回国。
    到今天为止，被美方说成“宁肯自杀也不愿遣返”的我方被俘人员已有二百七十人突破了特务控制遣返归来。
