Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, November 7th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic delivered a memorandum to the Swiss Legation in Warsaw on November 4th, replying to a memorandum from the Political Department (i.e., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) of the Swiss government on October 19th concerning the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The Polish government's memorandum states: "The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established under the agreement concerning the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea. Articles 3 and 7 of the agreement clearly stipulate that no force or threat of force shall be used against prisoners of war to obstruct their repatriation. No provision in the agreement can be interpreted as limiting the power of the Repatriation Commission to exercise its authority and responsibility over the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction. By appointing a representative to serve as a member of the Commission, the Swiss government has assumed the responsibility of implementing the terms of the prisoner repatriation agreement.

It is undeniable that any action by any member of the Repatriation Commission that fails to comply with the above agreement signifies an evasion of his fundamental responsibility."

The memorandum says: "The Swiss representative on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea is aware of the main reason for the current difficulties in the explanation work. The main reason is the terrorist activities carried out among the prisoners of war by the special agents of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, which are being openly supported by American officials, and this is no longer a secret." The memorandum points out: The Korean-Chinese side submitted a list to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with the names of more than 400 Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents who were active in the prisoner-of-war camps and intimidated the prisoners of war. The memorandum says: "The Repatriation Commission unanimously agreed that in the prisoner-of-war camps in Korea handed over by the United States, there were terrorist organizations of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, which resorted to the most brutal atrocities, even murder, to intimidate prisoners of war and obstruct their repatriation. Because of this terror, prisoners of war dared not express their desire to be repatriated. General Thimayya, the Indian representative on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, said at a press conference held in Panmunjom on October 6, 1953, that if the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who refused repatriation were given a truly free choice, they would express their willingness to be repatriated. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Commission to take effective steps to stop the control of terrorists and terrorist organizations and create conditions conducive to explanation work."

The memorandum points out: "If it were not for the opposition of certain members of the Repatriation Commission—including the Swiss representative—to taking sanctions against terrorists in accordance with the prisoner-of-war agreement and the rules established by the Repatriation Commission, the dark terrorist activities in the prisoner-of-war camps controlled by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents would have been stopped long ago, and the explanation work could have proceeded normally. It must be pointed out that under these circumstances, the Swiss government's reference to the Geneva Convention's prohibition of the use of force is completely unjustified and is actually an attempt to distort the true meaning of the Convention's provisions; it must also be pointed out that the Swiss representative's opposition to taking steps aimed at eliminating this evil terrorist control on the Repatriation Commission is an open violation of the Geneva Convention and undoubtedly a sabotage of this Convention."

The memorandum says: "The Polish representative on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, at the very beginning of the Commission's work, suggested stopping the blatant terrorist activities in the prisoner-of-war camps, pointing out that tolerating this terrorist activity is a contempt for the Geneva Convention. The Polish representative's attitude is completely different from the demand to use force against prisoners of war. It is entirely a demand to promote explanation work for prisoners of war and to free them from terrorist control. The Swiss government's memorandum distorts Poland's position and is completely out of line with the actual situation."

The memorandum points out: "The intolerable, cruel, physical, and mental terror and oppression against prisoners of war should be stopped. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that they can freely express their wishes. Any other attitude would mean succumbing to the terror of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents, which is unreasonable, immoral, unfair, and inconsistent with the Geneva Convention and the general principles of human rights mentioned in the Swiss government's memorandum."

The memorandum concludes: "Under these circumstances, the responsibility for the difficulties encountered by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea in implementing the decision to conduct explanation work for prisoners of war should be borne by those who organize terrorist activities in the prisoner-of-war camps and those who do not oppose such activities. All members of the Repatriation Commission have a responsibility to take concerted action to remedy the damage caused by past errors and harmful practices in treating prisoners of war who wish to return home. The government of the Polish People's Republic hopes that the Swiss representative will not evade this responsibility."

Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: TASS, Prague, November 9th: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, on October 19, 1953, the Czechoslovak Minister to Bern received a memorandum from the Swiss government regarding the explanation work for prisoners of war in Korea. On November 6, the Czechoslovak Minister to Bern delivered the Czechoslovak government's reply to the Swiss government. The reply stated: The explanation work for prisoners of war has been sabotaged from the beginning by the terrorist organizations of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents, who forcibly prevent prisoners of war from enjoying their right to repatriation. At the beginning of the Commission's work, the Czechoslovak representative had proposed specific measures to prevent special agents and provocateurs in the prisoner-of-war camps from obstructing prisoners of war from freely expressing their will. However, these proposals, which were fully in line with the Commission's rules, the armistice agreement, and the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, were rejected by the Commission on September 21, 1953, and also by the Swiss representative. On September 16, 1953, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unanimously adopted a decision on effective measures to be taken by the Indian custodial troops against terrorists (which the Swiss representative also voted in favor of). As long as this decision is fully implemented, the activities of terrorists can be stopped and the work of the Commission can be put on the right track. However, the Swiss representative evaded this decision of the Commission and therefore failed to stop the activities of the special agents. The Swiss representative's avoidance of taking effective measures against terrorists in the prisoner-of-war camps is encouraging their activities, and the violent killing of prisoners of war is a consequence of these activities.

    波捷两国分别驳覆瑞士的备忘录
    指责中立国遣返委员会瑞士代表反对制裁战俘营中美方特务的行为，瑞士代表应该负起执行遣俘协议的责任
    【新华社九日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙七日讯：波兰人民共和国外交部于十一月四日以备忘录一份交给瑞士驻华沙公使馆，答复瑞士政府政治部（即外交部）十月十九日的一份关于中立国遣返委员会的活动的备忘录。
    波兰政府的备忘录指出：“中立国遣返委员会是根据关于遣返在朝鲜的战俘的协议而成立的，协议的第三款和第七款明确规定，对于战俘不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠其遣返；协定中没有任何规定可被解释为限制遣返委员会行使它控制在其临时管辖下的战俘的职权与责任的权力。瑞士政府指派代表充任委员会委员，就担当了执行遣俘协议的条款的责任。
    无可否认，遣返委员会的任何委员如果有任何不遵守上述协定的行动，就意味着规避他的起码的责任。”
    备忘录说：“朝鲜中立国遣返委员会中的瑞士代表，是知道目前解释工作中存在困难的主要原因何在的。主要原因是李承晚与蒋介石的特务在战俘中间进行的恐怖活动，这种恐怖活动是得到美国官员的显然支持的，这已经不是什么秘密了。”备忘录指出：朝中方面曾向中立国遣返委员会提出一个名单，上面开列了在战俘营中进行活动并恐吓战俘的四百多名蒋介石与李承晚特务的名字。备忘录说：“遣返委员会一致认为，在美国移交过来的、在朝鲜的战俘营中，有着李承晚与蒋介石的恐怖组织，这些恐怖组织不惜采用最残暴的暴行，甚至用谋杀来恐吓战俘，阻挠他们遣返。由于这种恐怖，战俘不敢说出他们希望遣返的愿望。朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的印度代表蒂迈雅将军在一九五三年十月六日在板门店举行的记者招待会上说，假如让拒绝遣返的朝中战俘真正自由选择的话，他们会表示愿意遣返的。因此，委员会的责任是要采取有效的步骤来制止恐怖分子与恐怖组织的控制，创造有利于解释工作的条件。”
    备忘录指出：“如果不是由于遣返委员会中某些委员——其中有瑞士代表——反对按照遣俘协议和遣返委员会所订的规则来对恐怖分子采取制裁手段的话，李承晚和蒋介石特务所控制的战俘营中的暗无天日的恐怖活动早就得到了制止，解释工作也可以正常地进行了。必须指出，在这种情况之下，瑞士政府提到日内瓦公约中关于禁止使用武力的话是毫无理由的，实际上是企图曲解公约条文的真正意义；也必须指出，瑞士代表在遣返委员会上反对采取目的在于消除这种罪恶的恐怖控制的步骤，这是与日内瓦公约公开抵触的行为，无疑地也是破坏这个公约的行为。”
    备忘录说：“朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的波兰代表，在委员会刚开始工作时就建议制止战俘营里公然进行的罪恶的恐怖活动，指出容忍这种恐怖活动就是蔑视日内瓦公约。波兰代表的这种态度是与对战俘施用武力的要求迥然不同的。这完全是一个促进对战俘的解释工作并使他们脱离恐怖控制的要求。瑞士政府的备忘录歪曲了波兰的主张，完全不合乎实际情况。”
    备忘录指出：“应该停止对战俘进行的不可容忍的、残酷的、肉体上与精神上的恐怖与压迫。只有这样，才能够保证他们能自由表示自己的愿望。任何其他的态度都将意味着向李承晚与蒋介石特务的恐怖屈服，都是不合理、不道德、不公平并且不符合于瑞士政府备忘录所提到的日内瓦公约和一般的人权原则的。”
    备忘录最后说：“在这种情况下，朝鲜中立国遣返委员会在执行关于对战俘进行解释工作的决定时遭到困难的责任，应由那些在战俘营中组织恐怖活动的人，以及那些不反对这种活动的人来承担。遣返委员会全体委员有责任采取一致行动，以弥补由于过去对待希望回家的战俘的错误和有害的作法而造成的损害。波兰人民共和国政府希望瑞士代表能不规避这种责任。”
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社布拉格九日讯：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社消息，一九五三年十月十九日，捷克斯洛伐克驻伯尔尼公使接到瑞士政府关于对在朝鲜的战俘进行解释工作的备忘录。十一月六日捷克斯洛伐克驻伯尔尼公使将捷克斯洛伐克政府的覆文交给瑞士政府。覆文说：对战俘的解释工作从一开始就被蒋介石和李承晚特务的恐怖组织所破坏，这些特务组织用强力阻挠战俘享受自己的遣返权利。捷克斯洛伐克代表在委员会进行工作之初，就曾提出一些具体的措施，不让战俘营中的特务和挑衅分子阻挠战俘们自由地表达他们的意志。可是，这些完全符合委员会规则、符合停战协定、并符合关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的建议，于一九五三年九月二十一日被委员会拒绝了，也被瑞士代表拒绝了。一九五三年九月十六日，中立国遣返委员会一致通过一项关于印度看管部队对恐怖分子采取有效措施的决定（瑞士代表也投票赞成的）。只要贯彻执行这一决定，恐怖分子的活动就能够阻止，委员会的工作也能走上正轨。但是，瑞士代表逃避委员会的这一决定，因而不能制止特务分子的活动。瑞士代表避免对战俘营中的恐怖分子采取有效措施，它这种观点在助长着他们的活动，暴力杀害战俘就是这些活动的后果。
