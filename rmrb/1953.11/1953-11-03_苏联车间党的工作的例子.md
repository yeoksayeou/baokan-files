Examples of Party Work in Soviet Workshops
    Li He

    Recently, I read several books on the work of Soviet Party branches in workshops, and some of the examples are very useful for reference, so I am introducing them here. Before introducing these examples, it might be useful to explain how the Soviet workshop Party organization is structured.

    In the Soviet Union, factories and all enterprises, institutions, and collective farms, if there are more than one hundred Party members and alternate members, with the approval of the district or municipal Party committee, Party organizations (i.e., branches) are established within the factory's primary Party organization (i.e., general branch) according to workshop, work section, and section. The highest leading body of the Soviet workshop Party branch is the workshop branch Party Congress. The workshop branch Party Congress holds meetings no less than once a month. The Party Congress systematically discusses workshop production and Party life issues, such as socialist competition, mass work, and political education for Party members and youth. Discussions at the Party Congress are required to be conducted in a spirit of broadly developing criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up. Workshop Party branches with fifteen to one hundred Party members elect a branch committee of three to five people; workshop Party branches with more than one hundred Party members elect a branch committee of five to seven people. The workshop Party branch committee is the executive body of the workshop Party Congress, and it implements collective leadership. For example, all members of the Party branch committee participate in leading the workshop trade union organization and the Communist Youth League organization. There is a division of labor among the members of the Party branch committee. For example, the branch committee member in charge of production pays attention to how the trade union and the Communist Youth League are engaged in socialist competition, how Party members are fulfilling their guarantees in the competition, and how advanced experiences are being promoted; he maintains necessary contact with the workshop director and the chairman of the workshop trade union committee, and frequently talks with production team leaders, foremen, and production innovators. The workshop Party branch committee and the Party Congress, in their organizational work and political work, rely on the masses—workers and technicians in the workshop—to supervise the workshop's production and the workshop's administrative work.

    The Tenth Workshop of the Moscow "Red Warrior" Factory is a major workshop in the factory, producing and supplying rubber materials. The Party branch of this workshop goes deep into production, pays attention to the selection and arrangement of cadres, the utilization of equipment and materials, extensively supervises administrative work, and encourages all workshop employees to complete the production tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    In supervising the administrative work of the workshop, the secretary of the Tenth Workshop Party Branch Committee once made the mistake of replacing administration. Once, the district Party committee listened to the work report of the Party branch secretary of this workshop. Everyone criticized the workshop Party Branch Committee for not raising and discussing administrative work issues. The branch secretary explained that he had pointed out all the shortcomings to the workshop director in his work and had asked the workshop director to overcome them. Originally, the supervision of administrative work was the most important part of the work of the workshop Party, and the entire Party branch should participate, not just the branch secretary. However, the workshop Party Branch Committee made a mistake and entrusted this important task to the branch secretary during the division of labor. As a result, the branch secretary often did things that Party workers should not do. He bypassed the workshop director to dispatch production teams, went to the mechanical section to discuss parts for repairing equipment, and asked the warehouse to supply chemicals. In this way, the Party branch secretary replaced the administration of the workshop.

    After correction, the supervision of administrative work by the Tenth Workshop Party is realized by the entire Party branch. All Party members participate when the Party Branch Committee and the Party Congress prepare and discuss administrative work. During the discussion, Party members pay attention to starting from the Party's perspective so that the content of the meeting does not overlap with production meetings. The workshop Party branch checks and guides the work of administrative responsible personnel at all levels from the workshop director to the production team leader.

    The Tenth Workshop Party Congress once discussed the workshop's semi-annual work summary. The Party Branch Committee entrusted the workshop director to make a work report. According to the requirements of the Party Branch Committee, the workshop director estimated that he was making a report at the Party Congress rather than at a production meeting, so in the report he pointed out the shortcomings of the Party's leadership in socialist competition and political work. Under the guidance of such a report, the discussion also took on a different nature from production meetings. Party members criticized in their speeches that: the workshop's semi-annual production tasks were completed, but the task of increasing labor productivity was not completed, resulting in more wage expenses; the workshop's waste products increased, the basic reason being that some workers did not comply with technical discipline, and the workshop director and section chiefs did not pay necessary attention to the foremen and workers in this regard; the Party Branch Committee did not require propagandists to pay attention to the publicity of technical discipline, and did not urge those Party members who did not actively complete the Party's entrustment and promote advanced experience. Party members also criticized that the Party's work in improving labor productivity and product quality was not done enough.

    When the workshop Party branch implements supervision of administrative work, it is not limited to checking the work of the workshop administration and making correct demands and methods to the administration. The most important thing is to use organizational work and political work to mobilize all Party members in the branch and all employees in the workshop to realize these demands and methods.

    Based on the results of the discussion, the Tenth Workshop Branch Party Congress made a decision on the workshop's semi-annual work summary. The decision pointed out the shortcomings, analyzed the reasons; instructed Party members from the workshop director to general workers to strengthen technical discipline, eliminate waste products, and improve labor productivity in their respective positions; and required Party members responsible for administration at all levels in the workshop to strengthen the supervision of technical discipline and strictly deal with those who violate technical discipline. The Party Branch Committee suggested to the workshop director to eliminate those shortcomings in production equipment pointed out at the Party Congress within a week.

    The Party Congress proposed methods to strengthen the Party's organizational work and political work in the decision. It suggested to the workshop trade union committee to hold workers' meetings in each work shift, with the shift leader reporting on the situation of technical discipline. It tasked each Party group to hold open Party member meetings to discuss specific methods for strengthening technical discipline in each work section. It suggested to the wall newspaper editorial committee to publicize the situation of compliance with technical discipline in the workshop, criticize those who violate technical discipline, and publish quick reports. It tasked the Party Branch Committee to mobilize the propaganda team to better carry out discussions on the significance of technical discipline within three days. It suggested to the workshop trade union committee to review the competition conditions for collectives and individuals, so that they add guarantees for improving labor productivity and improving product quality. It suggested to the Communist Youth League branch committee to hold open Youth League member meetings, with the workshop director reporting on the issue of youth participating in the competition to improve labor productivity; and to establish Youth League member sentry posts for social inspection of product quality. It suggested to the workshop director and the chairman of the trade union committee to mobilize rationalization proposals and inventors to brainstorm on improving labor productivity and improving product quality.

    After the Party Congress took such measures to mobilize all Party members and employees in the workshop, after ten days, the Party Branch Committee discussed the implementation of the Party Congress's decision; while pointing out some achievements, it criticized the slow progress of the trade union committee in reviewing the competition conditions, and criticized those propagandists who were not active. Two weeks later, the Party Branch Committee checked the implementation of the decision again and pointed out the shortcomings again. Those who did not act effectively were severely criticized this time. The Party Branch Committee set a deadline for overcoming the shortcomings.

    In this way, under the supervision of the Party branch, the work of the Tenth Workshop was greatly improved, and two months later, it had completed the planned tasks in labor productivity, product quality, and all other production indicators.

    In supervising the workshop's production, the Party branch of the Tenth Workshop adheres to the principles of relying on the masses, supporting the advanced, and overcoming conservatism and other incorrect ideas.

    The workshop Party Branch Committee attaches importance to production meetings and workers' meetings. The workers' meetings and production meetings in the workshop are organized by the workshop trade union committee. However, the workshop Party Branch Committee not only supervises the organization of these meetings, but also practically helps trade union workers to choose meeting dates, prepare reports, and draft decisions. A member of the Party Branch Committee and the Party group leader must participate in each worker's meeting and production meeting. The worker's meetings in this workshop, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, discussed the decisions of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the tasks of the workshop employees, the summary of 1952, and the tasks of the workshop employees in organizing the competition to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The production meetings in this workshop reviewed the summary of the socialist competition to welcome the October Revolution Festival and the methods for improving product quality and carrying out the work of rationalization proposals and inventors. After the worker's meetings and production meetings, the workshop director invited the chairman of the workshop trade union committee and the section chiefs to discuss how to realize the workers' suggestions, determine the implementation deadline, and assign responsibilities. Under good preparation and correct leadership, worker's meetings and production meetings can develop criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up and combine the experience of the masses with the experience of the leadership.

    There was a time when the rubber materials produced by the Tenth Workshop were not sufficient to meet the needs of the galoshes finished product workshop. Some administrative responsible personnel in the Tenth Workshop, especially the section chiefs, believed that it was impossible to solve this problem without increasing manpower. At a production meeting, a worker talked about the reasons why the workshop could not supply rubber materials in time, pointing out that the workshop's administrative responsible personnel attributed too much to the lack of labor force and paid too little attention to organizing labor correctly. He suggested finding ways to solve the problem with the existing manpower. The Party Branch Committee paid attention to the worker's criticism. With the help of the quota calculator, it was calculated that if all the workers cutting rubber materials increased production by an average of 35%, it would not be necessary to increase the labor force. On some days, the workers had reached this level. What needed to be done was to eliminate the phenomenon of work interruption, thereby consistently reaching this level. The Party Branch Committee held a special meeting to study this issue and believed that it was possible. In order to persuade the administrative responsible personnel, the Party Branch Committee showed great persistence, regardless of the administrative responsible personnel's accusations. At the suggestion of the Party Branch Committee, the work of the sole cutting section was checked every day to ensure that there were sufficient spare parts for the cutting tools. As a result, the problems in production were eliminated, and the output of rubber material cutting workers reached 135%, ensuring a balanced supply to the galoshes finished product workshop according to the indicated charts.

    The Party Branch Committee of the Tenth Workshop pays attention to not allowing localism in supervising production. The Party Branch Committee once severely criticized a section chief because he requested too many spare parts for the equipment in his section.

    The Party Branch Committee of the Tenth Workshop generally discusses and solves problems in production work independently because it is familiar with the workshop situation, can analyze the reasons, and come up with solutions. However, when encountering problems that it cannot solve itself, the workshop Party branch also asks the factory Party committee for help. For example, when discussing the workshop's planning situation, it is necessary for the Party committee to intervene because it is necessary to make certain demands to the factory's planning section and labor organization section.

    In the Soviet Union, Party groups are established within the workshop Party branch according to work section, production team, or combined machine. These Party groups act at the work site, are very close to the employees, and are familiar with the situation, so they can well complete the tasks entrusted by the Party branch, promote advanced things, and carry out communist education for employees.

    The Kirov Factory in Leningrad has hundreds of Party groups. The Party group of a work section in the factory's mechanical workshop consists of ten Party members, including seven workers and three technicians. The group leader, Kozhireva, is a Stakhanovite worker. The workshop Party Branch Committee provides the Party group with practical help. The Branch Committee regularly listens to the group's reports. The Branch Secretary often goes to the work section and talks to Party members.

    This Party group has ensured that every Party member plays an exemplary role in production. For example, Party member milling machine operator Kokoshev mastered the fast milling method and became an excellent high-speed cutting worker. The parts he milled were all of excellent quality. The milling machine group he led became an excellent quality product group in the competition. He insists on studying at the night school branch of the factory's secondary technical school. The Party members of the Party group have made such progress in production because the Party group pays the most attention to the work of the work section and often discusses specific issues such as how to better adopt advanced methods. These issues are not studied narrowly from the perspective of production and technology, but from the Party's perspective. When adopting the high-speed metal cutting method, the Party group first requires Party members to understand and explain the political and economic significance of this new thing to non-Party members. The Party group meeting discusses how Party members fight for new things and how to help the people in the same work section in this regard. The Party group entrusted – the first comrade to publicize the significance of new things among the workers, the second comrade to establish a Stakhanov school with the foreman and the trade union group leader, and the third comrade to learn multiple skills to help the workers on other lathes. In this way, the Party group supports the initiatives of some people, promotes others, realizes the leading role of Party members in production, educates all workers with the example of Party members, and mobilizes all workers in the work section to well complete the production tasks.

    This Party group pays attention to mass political work to ensure the smooth progress of production. The Party group sent the Party group leader, the foreman, and three other comrades with better theoretical cultivation to be propagandists. After being approved by the workshop Party Branch Committee, they joined the workshop propaganda team, where they received instructions and exchanged propaganda experience. The three propagandists regularly read newspapers, held discussions, and explained the Party's and government's policies and the domestic and international situation among the workers. When explaining the Party's and government's policies, they are very good at connecting national affairs with the life of the work section and with their efforts in production.

    The Party members of this Party group all study and systematically improve their ideological and political level, so they can often stay ahead of the masses in the work section. Several Party members self-study the history of the CPSU according to Marxist-Leninist classics, another few participate in the study class of the Concise History of the CPSU, one participates in the theoretical study group of the factory Party research office, and leads the Communist Youth League political study class. The Party group leader helps the workshop Party branch supervise the learning of Party members and reports the learning situation to the Party Branch Committee and the Party group meeting. The Party group meeting also listens to reports on the learning situation of Party members.

    苏联车间党的工作的例子
    李何
    最近读到了几本苏联车间党的工作的书籍，其中个别例子很有参考价值，所以把它们介绍过来。在介绍这些例子之前，不妨交代一下苏联车间党的组织是怎样组成的。
    在苏联，工厂和一切企业、机关、集体农庄一样，凡有党员和候补党员一百个人以上的，经过区党委或市党委的批准，在全厂党的基层组织（即总支部）之内，按车间、工段、科成立有党的组织（即分支部）。苏联车间党支部的最高领导机关是车间支部党员大会。车间支部党员大会每月举行不少于一次的会议。党员大会有计划地讨论车间生产和党内生活问题，如像社会主义竞赛、群众工作、党员和青年的政治教育等。党员大会上的讨论，都是要求在广泛展开自下而上的批评和自我批评的精神上进行的。有党员十五个人以上、一百个人以下的车间党支部，选出三个人到五个人的支部委员会；有党员一百个人以上的车间党支部，选出五个人到七个人的支部委员会。车间党支部委员会是车间党员大会的执行机关，它实行着集体领导。例如，党支部委员会全体都参与领导车间工会组织和青年团组织。党支部委员会各委员之间有分工。例如，负责生产方面的支部委员，注意工会和青年团的组织怎样从事社会主义竞赛，党员们怎样完成在竞赛中的保证和推广先进经验；他和车间主任、车间工会委员会主席取得必要联系，经常和生产组长、领班、生产革新者等谈话。车间党支部委员会和党员大会，在自己的组织工作和政治工作中，依靠群众——车间里的工人和技术人员，对车间的生产，对车间的行政工作，进行着监督。
    莫斯科“红色壮士”工厂的第十车间是工厂的一个主要车间，生产和供应着胶皮材料。这个车间的党支部深入生产，注意干部的选拔和安排、设备和材料的利用，广泛地进行对行政工作的监督，鼓励全车间职工提前完成第五个五年计划的生产任务。
    在监督车间行政工作中，第十车间党支部委员会书记曾经犯了代替行政的毛病。有一次，区党委员会听取了这个车间党支部书记的工作报告。大家批评车间党支部委员会没有提出和讨论行政工作问题。这位支部书记解释说，他在工作中已经向车间主任指出所有缺点并且已经要求车间主任克服它们。本来，对行政工作的监督，是车间党的工作的最主要部分，应该整个党支部都参加，不是一个支部书记的事情。但是这个车间党支部委员会弄错了，在分工时把这个重大任务付托给支部书记。发展的结果，支部书记时常做着不是党的工作人员应做的事。他不经过车间主任调度生产组，跑到机械科商量修理设备的零件，向库房要求供应化学品。这样，党支部书记代替了车间的行政。
    经过纠正后，第十车间党对行政工作的监督，由整个党支部来实现。在党支部委员会和党员大会准备和讨论行政工作时，全体党员都参加。讨论时，党员们注意从党的角度出发，使会议内容不致和生产会议重复。车间党支部检查和指导车间主任直到生产组组长各级行政负责人员的工作。
    第十车间党员大会曾经讨论车间半年工作总结。党支部委员会委托车间主任做工作报告。车间主任根据党支部委员会的要求，估计到是在党员大会上而不是在生产会议上做报告，所以在报告中指出了在社会主义竞赛和政治工作中党的领导的缺点。在这样的报告引导下，讨论也带着与生产会议不同的性质。党员在发言中批评说：车间半年生产任务完成了，但是提高劳动生产率的任务没有完成，结果多开支了工资；车间废品增加了，其基本原因是有些工人不遵守技术纪律，而车间主任和工段长在这方面没有向领班和工人提出必要注意；党支部委员会没有要求宣传员注意技术纪律的宣传，没有督促那些不积极完成党的委托和推广先进经验的党员。党员也批评了在提高劳动生产率和产品质量方面党的工作做得不够。
    车间党支部在实现对行政工作的监督时，不限于检查车间行政的工作，向行政提出正确的要求和办法，最主要的在于用组织工作和政治工作，动员全支部党员和全车间职工去实现这些要求和办法。
    第十车间支部党员大会根据讨论的结果，对车间半年工作总结作出了决定。在决定中指出缺点，分析原因；责成从当车间主任到一般工人的党员在各自岗位上加强技术纪律、消灭废品、提高劳动生产率；要求在车间各级行政负责的党员加强技术纪律的监督和严格处理违犯技术纪律者。党支部委员会向车间主任建议在一星期内消除那些党员大会上所指出的生产设备上的缺点。
    党员大会在决定中提出了加强党的组织工作和政治工作的办法。向车间工会委员会建议了举行各工作班工人会议，由值班长报告技术纪律情况。责成了各个党小组举行公开的党员会议，以讨论在各工段加强技术纪律的具体办法。向墙报编辑委员会建议了公布车间内遵守技术纪律的情形、批评违犯技术纪律者和出版快报。责成了党支部委员会在三天内发动宣传队更好地展开关于技术纪律的意义的座谈。向车间工会委员会建议了审查集体和个人的竞赛条件，使添加提高劳动生产率和改进产品质量方面的保证。向青年团支部委员会建议了：举行公开的团员大会，由车间主任报告青年参加提高劳动生产率的竞赛问题；建立对产品质量作社会检查的团员岗哨。向车间主任和工会委员会主席建议发动合理化建议和发明者在提高劳动生产率和改进产品质量方面动脑筋。
    在党员大会采取这样动员车间全体党员和职工的措施以后，过了十天，党支部委员会讨论了党员大会的决定执行的情形；在指出某些成绩的同时，批评了工会委员会在审查竞赛条件方面进展的迟缓，批评了那些没有动作的宣传员。过了两个星期，党支部委员会又检查了决定执行的情形，再指出了缺点。行动不力的人在这次受到了严厉批评。党支部委员会规定了克服缺点的期限。
    这样，在党支部的监督下，第十车间工作大大改进了，两个月后已经在劳动生产率、产品质量以及其他一切生产指标上完成了计划任务。
    第十车间党支部在监督车间的生产中，是遵守着依靠群众、支持先进、克服保守及其他不正确思想的原则的。
    车间党支部委员会重视生产会议、工人会议。车间的工人会议和生产会议，是归车间工会委员会负责组织的。但是车间党支部委员会不但监督这些会议的组织，而且实际地帮助工会工作人员选择会期、准备报告、草拟决定。每次工人会议和生产会议一定有党支部委员和党小组长参加。这个车间的工人会议，在去年底和今年初，讨论了苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决定与车间职工的任务、一九五二年总结、车间职工在组织提前完成第五个五年计划的竞赛中的任务。这个车间的生产会议审查了迎接十月革命节的社会主义竞赛总结、改善产品质量和开展合理化建议和发明者的工作的办法。在工人会议和生产会议之后，车间主任邀请了车间工会委员会主席、各工段长商量怎样实现工人们的建议，确定实现的期限和分头负责。工人会议和生产会议在很好准备和正确领导下，是能够展开自下而上的批评和自我批评，使群众的经验与领导的经验相结合的。
    第十车间有一个时候出产的胶皮材料供应不及套鞋成品车间的需要。第十车间有些行政负责人特别是各工段长认为不增加人力是不可能解决这个问题的。在一次生产会议上，一位工人谈到了车间不能及时供应胶皮材料的原因，指出了车间行政负责人太多归咎于劳动力不足而太少关心正确地组织劳动。他建议在现有人力上想办法。党支部委员会注意了这位工人的批评。在定额计算员帮助下，算出了如果所有裁胶皮材料的工人平均增产百分之三十五，就不必增加劳动力。在有些日子里，工人们曾经达到这个水平。要做的是消灭工作间歇现象，从而经常达到这个水平。党支部委员会举行了特别会议研究这个问题，认为这是可能做到的。为了说服行政负责人，党支部委员会表现了很大的坚持精神，不顾行政负责人的责难。在党支部委员会的提议下，每天检查裁鞋底工段的工作，保证剪裁工具有足够的后备零件。结果，生产中的毛病消除了，裁胶皮材料工人的产量达到了百分之一三五，保证了按指示图表均衡地供应套鞋成品车间。
    第十车间党支部在监督生产中注意不许有本位思想。党支部曾经严厉批评了一位工段长，因为他为他那工段的设备要求了太多的后备零件。
    第十车间党支部一般都是独立地讨论和解决生产工作中的问题的，因为它熟悉车间情况，会分析原因和想出办法。但是遇着自己不能解决的问题时，车间党支部也请求工厂党委员会帮助。例如讨论车间内的计划情况时，需要党委过问，因为需要向工厂的计划科和劳动组织科提出某些要求。
    在苏联，在车间党支部内按照工段、生产组或联动机建立党的小组。这些党小组就在工作地点行动，非常接近职工和熟悉情况，因此它们能够很好地完成党支部委托的任务，推广先进事物，对职工进行共产主义教育。
    列宁格勒基洛夫工厂有几百个党小组。工厂机械车间有一个工段的党小组，由十个党员组成，包括七个工人和三个技术人员。组长柯芝列娃是一个斯大哈诺夫式工作者。车间党支部委员会给这个党小组以实际的帮助。支部委员会定期听取小组的报告。支部书记时常到工段和党员谈话。
    这个党小组做到了使每个党员在生产中都起着模范作用。例如，党员铣工柯科雪夫掌握了快铣法，成为优秀的高速切削工人。他铣出来的零件都是优等的。他带领的铣工组在竞赛中成为优等质量产品组。他坚持在工厂里中等技术学校的夜间分校学习。党小组党员在生产上那样进步，是由于党小组最注意工段的工作，经常讨论如像怎样很好地采用先进方法之类具体问题。这些问题不是狭隘地从生产和技术观点出发，而是从党的角度来研究。在采用金属高速切削法时，党小组首先要求党员了解和向非党员解释这种新事物的政治和经济意义。党小组会议讨论党员怎样为新事物斗争，怎样在这方面帮助同工段的人们。党小组委托——第一位同志在工人中宣传新事物的意义，第二位同志跟领班与工会小组长一起建立斯大哈诺夫学校，第三位同志学会多种技能以便帮助别的车床的工人。这样，党小组支持一些人的创议，推动另外一些人，实现党员在生产中的带头作用，以党员的榜样教育全体工人，动员全工段工人很好完成生产任务。
    这个党小组注意群众政治工作以保证生产的顺利进行，党小组派了党小组长、领班等三个理论修养较好的同志当宣传员。他们经过车间党支部委员会的批准，加入了车间宣传队，在那里受到指示和交流宣传经验。三个宣传员经常在工人中读报、座谈、讲解党和政府的政策、国内外形势。在讲解党和政府政策的时候，他们很会把国家大事和工段的生活、和他们在生产上的努力联系起来。
    这个党小组的党员都学习，有系统地提高自己的思想和政治水平，因此，在工段里能够经常走在群众的前面。几个党员根据马克思主义—列宁主义经典著作自修联共党史，另外几个参加联共党史简明读本学习班，有一个参加工厂党研究室的理论学习组并且领导着青年团政治学习班。党小组长帮助车间党支部监督党员的学习，把学习情况汇报党支部委员会和党小组会议。党小组会议也听取党员学习情况的报告。十月十六日于莫斯科
