Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 2nd: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in a letter dated October 30th to Hamblen, head of the US "Repatriation" Group, refuted Hamblen's arrogant and unreasonable protest regarding the request for repatriation by Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel Yue Heidan during the explanation work on October 17th.

In his so-called protest, Hamblen described Yue Heidan, who requested repatriation during the explanation process but was intimidated and obstructed by US special agents, as "refusing repatriation" and being "threatened" by our side. However, the fact that Yue Heidan was repatriated on October 23rd and his accusations against the special agent rule in the POW camp after his return shattered Hamblen's fabricated lies.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stated in its letter to Hamblen: "Your observers' view is that the true intention of the said prisoner of war was to go to Taiwan. In this regard, this assumption is clearly incorrect, and the conclusion was reached too early. The said prisoner of war, when given a quiet period to consider, unhesitatingly expressed his desire for repatriation. During the process of approving his application on October 23rd, the Commission questioned him in great detail, at which time he explicitly insisted on repatriation and was very afraid of being sent elsewhere. Therefore, it is clear that the matter was handled fairly, and the prisoner of war's wishes have been fulfilled."

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission pointed out in the letter: "Based on the experience gained from its two explanation works on October 15th and 17th, the Commission does not believe that the prisoner of war shouting the words 'Taiwan' is the final and certain proof of his intention. The Commission has seen that even the prisoner of war you are talking about shouted 'Taiwan' when entering the tent, but ultimately decided to request repatriation."

    中立国遣返委员会驳斥汉布伦的荒谬抗议
    我方被俘人员岳黑旦对特务的控诉粉碎了美方捏造的谎言
    【新华社开城二日电】中立国遣返委员会十月三十日写信答复美方“遣返”组组长汉布伦，驳斥汉布伦就十月十七日解释工作进行时中国人民志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦要求遣返一事所提出的蛮横无理的抗议。
    汉布伦在他的所谓抗议中把在解释过程中要求遣返而受到美方特务恫吓和阻挠的岳黑旦，说成是“拒绝遣返”的并受到我方的“威胁”。但是，岳黑旦在十月二十三日遣返归来的事实和他归来以后对战俘营中特务统治的控诉粉碎了汉布伦捏造的谎言。
    中立国遣返委员会在答复汉布伦的信里说：“你的观察员们的说法是认为所说的这个战俘的真正意图是到台湾去。就这一点而论，这种假定显然是不正确的，而且结论下得太早了。所说的战俘在得到一个安静的时期来考虑时就毫不犹豫地表示他希望遣返。十月二十三日在批准他的申请的过程中，委员会向他盘问得很详细，当时他明确地坚持要求遣返，并且很害怕被遣送到别的地方去。所以，很明显，事情办得公正，战俘的希望已经得到满足。”
    中立国遣返委员会在信里指出：“本委员会基于它在十月十五日和十七日的两次解释工作中得到的经验，觉得不能认为战俘喊‘台湾’两字，就是他的意图的最后的和确实的证明。本委员会看到，甚至你所谈到的这个战俘，在走入帐篷时也是高喊‘台湾’二字的，但最后却决定要求遣返。”
