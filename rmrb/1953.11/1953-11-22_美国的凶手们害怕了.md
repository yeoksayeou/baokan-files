    The American Murderers are Scared
    Huang Gang
    New York Dispatch: In mid-October, the U.S. government, using the excuse that the two sons of the Rosenbergs were not "legal residents" of Toms River, had the superintendent of Toms River Elementary School come forward and order them to "immediately withdraw from school."
    This is proof that the American reactionaries are persecuting the two orphans of the peace fighters, the Rosenbergs.
    What does this persecution demonstrate? It shows that the executioners in the White House are very afraid. It has been less than four months since the Rosenbergs were murdered, but the jailers in Washington, their bloodstained hands, are trembling.
    The dead are already buried. The sons have been persecuted. One is only six years old, and the other is just ten. They are both so honest and kind. Ten-year-old Michael was even elected as the class leader of his class because of his excellent academic performance; why would such young children make the current American regime feel afraid, and want to expel them from school? This is because the sons will always remember: their parents walked to the electric chair with their heads held high and with firm steps; this is because the murderers in the White House are afraid that the growth and normal development of the orphans will further and thoroughly expose the truth of the Rosenberg case to the world. The murderers are afraid of pure hearts, afraid of honest voices, afraid of human dignity and self-confidence, afraid that all these precious traditions belonging to the martyred parents will play their due role in the descendants of the martyrs. Therefore, those in power in Washington do not hesitate to display the skills of their constabulary rule on two young children.
    But bullies who bully children cannot prove their strength, let alone save themselves from failure. Mrs. Rosenberg wrote to her sons in prison: "Your mother is combative"; now, the struggle continues. The persecuted children will fully understand: from Hyde Park in London to the French Liberation Fighters Memorial in Paris, from the angry gatherings of Indians in South Africa to the torchlight parades in West Berlin, hundreds of millions of people around the world have shown their strength and anger in order to rescue and mourn the Rosenbergs. This is exactly what the American murderers are afraid of. The result of the murderers raising their butcher knives is to make all people who demand peace unite more closely. The murderers deeply feel that the orphans of the Rosenbergs are not alone. All kind people in the world know that the sacrifice of the Rosenbergs was for "loyalty to American democracy, loyalty to justice and friendship, for peace, for bread, for roses, for the innocent smiles of children"; this is the optimistic last words and bright ideals of the Rosenbergs.
    Although the cowardly murderers can still today impose unwarranted charges on the two orphans and terminate their right to education, the Rosenberg children will surely see the realization of their parents' legacy. By that day, the wreaths on the Rosenberg couple's tomb will not have withered, and the dark rule in Washington will be completely disintegrated. The murderers in the White House will then become truly "illegal residents." These military dictators who fear peace and intimidate mankind can only have one end, that is, to go to the guillotine along with the demise of the autocratic regime they created.

    美国的凶手们害怕了
    黄钢
    纽约消息：十月中旬，美国政府藉口说罗森堡夫妇的两个儿子不是汤姆斯河的“合法居民”，由汤姆斯河小学的学监出面，勒令他们“立即退学”。
    这是美国反动派迫害和平战士罗森堡夫妇的两个孤儿的证明。
    这种迫害说明了什么呢？说明白宫的刽子手是十分害怕了。这是罗森堡夫妇被残杀还不到四个月的时候，但是，华盛顿的狱卒们，染血的双手在发抖了。
    死者已经埋葬了。儿子又遭到了迫害。一个只有六岁，一个也不过十岁。他们都是那样诚实和善良，十岁的迈克尔因为学习成绩优良，还被选为他班里的班长；这样的幼童，为什么会使今天的美国政权感到害怕，要从学校里驱逐他们呢？这是因为儿子们永远都会记得：他们的父母是昂着头，用着坚定的脚步走上电椅的；这是因为白宫的凶手们，害怕孤儿们的生长和正常的发展，会使罗森堡案件的真象在全世界进一步彻底的暴露。凶手们害怕纯净的心灵，害怕诚实的声音，害怕人类的自尊和自信，害怕所有这些属于殉难的父母的珍贵的传统，会在烈士们的后代身上，起到它应有的作用。因此，华盛顿的当权者们，才不惜在两个小孩子身上，去显露自己宪警统治的身手。
    但是欺负孩子们的打手，并不能证明自己的坚强，更不能挽救本身的失败。罗森堡夫人在监狱里给她的儿子们写道：“你们的妈妈是有斗争性的”；现在，斗争仍在继续进行着。被迫害的孩子们完全会清楚：从伦敦的海德公园到巴黎的法国解放战士纪念碑前，从南非印度人愤怒的集会到西柏林高举火炬的游行示威，全世界亿万的人民，都曾经为了营救和追悼罗森堡夫妇，显示过他们的力量和愤怒。美国的谋杀犯们所害怕的正是这一点。凶手们扬起屠刀的结果，使一切要求和平的人们团结得更紧密了。凶手们深深感到罗森堡夫妇的孤儿是并不孤独的。全世界善良的人们，都知道罗森堡夫妇的牺牲是为了“忠于美国的民主、忠于正义和友爱，是为了和平，为了面包，为了玫瑰花，为了孩子们无邪的笑”；这是罗森堡夫妇乐观的遗言，光明的理想。
    尽管胆怯的凶手们今天还可以给两个孤儿安上莫须有的罪名，终止他们求学的权利，但是罗森堡的孩子们一定会看到父母遗志的实现。到那一天，罗森堡夫妇墓地上的花圈并不曾凋谢，而华盛顿的黑暗统治将完全瓦解。白宫的凶手们当时会变成真正“不合法的居民”。这些畏惧和平、恐吓人类的军事独裁者，只可能有一个结局，那就是伴随着自己创立的专制政体的灭亡走上断头台。
