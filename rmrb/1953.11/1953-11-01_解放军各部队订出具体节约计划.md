    After the People's Liberation Army (PLA) units deployed the work of cherishing state property and practicing economy among their respective departments, many units have formulated specific economy plans.

    The General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission recently issued instructions to the entire army, calling on all commanders and fighters, in the face of the glorious task of our country's first five-year economic construction plan, to vigilantly defend the territory and safeguard national economic construction on the one hand; and on the other hand, to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and save financial and material resources as much as possible to be used for national economic construction.

    After receiving the instructions from the General Political Department, the Party committees and leading organs of the major military regions and various special forces of the Chinese Communist Party's People's Liberation Army conducted serious discussions and transmissions, and made decisions to implement the spirit of these instructions. The decision of the Chinese Communist Party's North China Military Region Party Committee requires all its subordinate units to strengthen technical training in regular training, improve the quality of troops, and universally conduct education on cherishing weapons, vehicles, horses, and all state assets. Military transportation must be more planned, with strict systems and effective methods to reduce expenditures. The military factories of the logistics department must formulate specific and effective methods to increase production, reduce costs, and ensure quality. The Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party's East China Military Region and Central South Military Region also put forward specific measures to practice economy and tighten expenditures, while calling on the troops to save food and fuel.

    After in-depth mobilization and deployment, various units have formulated specific plans to cherish state property and practice economy. The Materials Section of the Engineering Department of the Central South Military Region Headquarters has formulated a specific plan to adopt self-made equipment, which is expected to save 6 billion yuan by the end of the year. The Political Department and Cadre Department and other organs of the Northeast Military Region have formulated a plan to save 800 million yuan in recurring expenses. The six factories under the Logistics Military Supply Production Department of the Northwest Military Region, in the fourth quarter production plan, are expected to save 8.63 billion yuan, exceeding the original requirement by more than 60 percent. The troops undertaking the construction task on the Kangzang Highway are further developing a democratic creative movement on construction projects, advocating rationalization proposals, improving tools, improving work efficiency, saving materials, overcoming waste, and striving to save more wealth for the country. The agricultural production units stationed in Xinjiang have formulated a production increase and economy plan in the midst of the intense autumn harvest, requiring all production units to do a good job in this year's autumn harvest and prepare for next year's production.

    解放军各部队订出具体节约计划
    【新华社讯】中国人民解放军各部队布置所属各部展开爱护国家财产、厉行节约的工作后，很多部队已订出具体的节约计划。
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部最近曾向全军发出指示，号召全军指挥员、战斗员在我国第一个五年经济建设计划的光荣任务前面，一方面要警惕地保卫国土、保卫国家经济建设；另方面要发扬艰苦奋斗精神，尽一切可能，节省出财力物力，用到国家经济建设上去。
    中国共产党人民解放军各大军区、各特种兵部队的党委会和领导机关在接到总政治部的指示后，都进行了认真的讨论和传达，并作出了贯彻这一指示精神的决定。中国共产党华北军区党委会的决定中，要求所属各部队必须在正规训练中加强技术训练，提高部队质量，并普遍进行爱护武器、车辆、马匹和一切国家资财的教育。军事运输必须更有计划，必须有严格的制度和有效的办法，以缩减开支，后勤部门各军工工厂，必须订出具体有效的办法，增加生产，降低成本，保证质量。中国共产党华东军区、中南军区党委会并提出了厉行节约、紧缩开支的具体措施，同时号召部队要节省粮食和油料。
    经深入动员和布置后，各部队纷纷订出爱护国家资财和厉行节约的具体计划。中南军区司令部工程处材料科订出了采用自制器材的具体计划，预计到年底可节约六十亿元。东北军区政治部和干部部等机关，已订出节约经常费八亿元的计划。西北军区后勤军需生产部所属六个工厂，在第四季度的生产计划中，预计可节约八十六亿三千万元，超过原来要求百分之六十以上。在康藏公路上担任修建任务的部队，正进一步开展修建工程上的民主创造运动，提倡合理化建议，改善工具，提高工作效率，节省材料，克服浪费现象，争取为国家节约更多的财富。驻新疆的农业生产部队，在紧张的秋收中订出了增产节约计划，要求各生产部队做好今年的秋收工作，同时为明年的生产作好准备。
