Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd—The Chinese Academy of Sciences held an Institute Director Conference in Beijing from October 14th to November 7th. Based on a review of the implementation of the 1953 work plan, the conference discussed the work direction for the next few years and the work priorities for 1954, in accordance with the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period.

The conference was held in five groups: mathematics and physics, technical sciences, chemistry, biology and earth sciences, and social sciences. They were presided over by Vice Presidents Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun respectively. Vice President Zhang Jiafu made a report on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period at the meetings of each group.

The conference tentatively determined the work direction for each research unit in the next few years and the work priorities for next year:

The biology and earth sciences departments should cooperate with the country's large-scale construction and focus on the investigation and research of the country's natural conditions and resources. The investigation and research of the Yellow River basin will be the focus of this work. In addition, it is necessary to solve some basic scientific problems existing in increasing agricultural production per unit area and medical and health care. The advanced academic thoughts of great scholars such as Michurin, Pavlov, and Lepeshinskaya should be gradually implemented into practical research work.

The chemistry department should gradually establish a complete and comprehensive chemistry research institution on the existing foundation, gradually enrich some of the weak links in the current chemistry department, and further closely cooperate with industrial production, especially with heavy industrial production such as fuel, rubber, metallurgy, and electrolysis industries.

The mathematics and physics departments should prepare conditions for comprehensively solving major scientific and theoretical problems in national construction. In order to effectively promote the development of other scientific departments and improve the level of engineering technology, a sufficient number of physicists and mathematicians with high academic standards must be trained.

The technical sciences department should conduct research closely in conjunction with China's existing metallurgical industry and the establishment of new metallurgical industries, and conduct research in cooperation with other aspects of factories, mines, and basic construction projects.

The main and regular task of the social sciences department is to conscientiously and continuously improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of researchers. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the study of modern Chinese history and gradually carry out the study of ancient and medieval history. In addition, it is necessary to cooperate with national economic construction and focus on carrying out investigation and research on the handicraft industry economy.

The conference conducted detailed discussions on the common problems existing in various research units—learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, training cadres, organizing leadership, and contact and cooperation with universities, industrial departments, and research institutions of factories and mines—and reached a consensus. The heads of various research units all believe that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and training cadres are important conditions for the development of China's scientific undertakings. All research units have decided to formulate specific plans for the two tasks of learning from the Soviet Union and training cadres as an indispensable part of the entire work plan.

The conference emphasized the importance of comprehensive research work, believing that carrying out comprehensive research work is one of the best ways to solve major tasks in national construction and promote scientific development.

It is the first time in the Chinese Academy of Sciences that the work direction and plan of each research unit have been determined through joint discussions by various research units with similar characteristics. This conference has enabled the various research units to have a more comprehensive understanding of each other, which will be a good start for strengthening the mutual cooperation and contact between the various research units and for giving full play to the overall strength of various sciences to serve national construction.

    中国科学院召开研究所所长会议
    根据总路线确定工作方向和重点
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国科学院自十月十四日到十一月七日在北京召开研究所所长会议，在检查一九五三年工作计划执行情况的基础上，根据国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务讨论了今后数年内的工作方向和一九五四年的工作重点。
    会议分数学和物理、技术科学、化学、生物和地学、社会科学五个组先后举行，分别由副院长李四光、陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训主持。副院长张稼夫在各组的会议上作了关于国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的传达报告。
    会议初步确定了各研究单位今后数年内的工作方向和明年的工作重点：
    生物、地学部门，应配合国家大规模建设，以国家自然条件与资源的调查研究为主要任务。对黄河流域的考察研究将是这方面工作的重点。此外，并要解决在提高农业生产单位面积产量和医疗保健事业方面所存在的一些基本科学问题。要把米丘林、巴甫洛夫、列皮辛斯卡雅等伟大学者的先进学术思想逐步贯彻到实际研究工作中去。
    化学部门，要在现有的基础上逐步建立起一个规模完备、全面发展的化学研究机构，逐步充实目前化学部门中的一些薄弱环节，进一步与工业生产，特别是与重工业生产如燃料、橡胶、冶金及电解等工业密切配合。
    数学、物理部门，要为能够综合解决国家建设中的重大科学理论问题准备条件。为了能有效地促进其他科学部门的发展和提高工程技术水平，必须培养足够数量的有高度学术水平的物理、数学方面的科学家。
    技术科学部门，要密切结合我国现有冶金工业与新冶金工业的建立展开研究工作，并配合其他方面的厂矿与基本建设工程进行研究工作。
    社会科学部门，主要的和经常的任务是认真地、不断地提高研究人员的马克思列宁主义理论水平。同时，要加强对中国近代史的研究和逐步开展上古史和中古史的研究。此外，还要配合国家经济建设，着重开展对手工业经济的调查研究。
    会议对各研究单位普遍存在的问题——学习苏联先进经验，培养干部，组织领导，与高等学校以及产业部门、厂矿的研究机构的联系和合作——进行了详细的讨论，并取得了一致的认识。各研究单位的负责人都认为学习苏联先进经验和培养干部是发展我国科学事业的重要条件。各研究单位都决定将学习苏联和培养干部两项任务订出具体计划，作为整个工作计划中不可缺少的部分。
    会议强调了综合性研究工作的重要性，认为开展综合性的研究工作是解决国家建设中的重大任务和推动科学发展的最好的途径之一。
    像这样经过性质相近的各研究单位共同讨论来确定各研究单位的工作方向和计划，在中国科学院还是首次。这次会议使各研究单位之间互相有了较全面的了解，这对加强各研究单位间的互相配合与联系，对发挥各门科学的总体力量服务于国家建设，将是一个良好的开端。
