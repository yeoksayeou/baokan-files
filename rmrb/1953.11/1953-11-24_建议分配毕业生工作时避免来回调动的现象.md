    Suggestions to Avoid Unnecessary Transfers When Assigning Jobs to Graduates

    Xu Junda from the Central Transportation Department's Navigation Engineering Bureau writes: When the Central Personnel Department and certain departments assign jobs to graduates from universities, technical schools, or training programs, they often transfer students from all over the country to Beijing, and then the central government distributes them down through the levels. For example, this time many university graduates were transferred from Shanghai to Beijing, but later they were assigned to work in Shanghai. Some central departments also use this method when transferring cadres, as is the case with our Ministry of Transportation. This creates a phenomenon of futile back-and-forth movement and wasted money. It is suggested that in the future, when assigning jobs to graduates or transferring cadres, all departments should prepare in advance and directly assign jobs according to the needs of various regions and departments, in a planned manner, to avoid unnecessary complications and waste.

    Ming Zhaoli from the Xingyi Branch of the Guizhou Provincial People's Court writes: Some university graduates in the Southwest Region were transferred from Chongqing to Beijing, and then assigned back to Kunming. This back-and-forth movement wasted a lot of travel expenses and time. This situation should be avoided in the future.

### 建议分配毕业生工作时避免来回调动的现象

    建议分配毕业生工作时避免来回调动的现象
    中央交通部航务工程总局徐君达来信：中央人事部和某些部门分配高等学校、中等技术学校或训练班毕业学生的工作时，经常把学生从各地调到北京，然后再由中央逐级分配下去。如这次很多高等学校毕业生由上海调到北京，但后来又分配到上海去工作。中央某些部门在调动干部工作时也采用这样的办法，我们交通部就是如此。这就造成了往返徒劳和金钱浪费的现象。建议今后各部门在分配毕业生或调动干部时，应该事先作好准备，按照各地区、各部门的需要，有计划地直接分配工作，以免不必要的周折和浪费。
    贵州省人民法院兴义分院明照黎来信：西南区高等学校毕业生有的由重庆调到北京，然后再分配回昆明，一来一往浪费了好多的旅费与时间。这种情况今后应该避免。
