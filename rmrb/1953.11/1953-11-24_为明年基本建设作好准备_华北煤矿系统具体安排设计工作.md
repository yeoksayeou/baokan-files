To Prepare for Next Year's Capital Construction
North China Coal Mining System Makes Specific Arrangements for Design Work

    The North China Coal Mining Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government recently held a design conference to specifically arrange the engineering design tasks for 1954. In 1954, 68.8 percent of the capital construction investment of North China's state-owned coal mines will be put into mine construction, including the construction of four pairs of small inclined shafts with an annual output of 300,000 tons. Many mines will also be renovated, restored, or partially renovated. With the continued completion of these projects, coal production in North China will increase by more than 20 percent in 1954 compared to 1953, and production in 1955 will increase by more than 2 million tons compared to 1954. Based on the development of production, welfare projects will be constructed accordingly. In 1954 alone, workers' housing will amount to 195,000 square meters. Therefore, the capital construction tasks of the North China coal mining system in 1954 are very important and arduous.

    In order to ensure timely and smooth construction next year, the design conference decided that 28 percent of the 1954 engineering design should be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, 38.8 percent in the first quarter of next year, and all design work should be completed in the second quarter, except for individual projects accounting for 1 percent that need to be completed in the third quarter. At the meeting, engineering projects were prioritized based on their importance and urgency, the availability of design materials and equipment, and the strength of design and construction forces. Specific schedules and responsible persons were determined. The meeting emphasized that in order to ensure the successful completion of design tasks, designers must accept the advanced design ideas and experiences of the Soviet Union and criticize incorrect ideas based on the summary of specific designs, to establish advanced and correct design thinking. It also requires all design units to establish four systems: a data investigation and research system, a design responsibility system, a communication system, and a review and examination system, to prevent the recurrence of phenomena such as multi-headed responsibility for data collection and careless review and examination that occurred in 1953. In order to accelerate progress and improve quality, all units are required to gradually adopt standard designs and cultivate design forces through the method of apprenticeships, so as to ensure the timely completion of the 1954 design tasks.

    为明年基本建设作好准备
    华北煤矿系统具体安排设计工作
    中央人民政府燃料工业部华北煤矿管理局，于日前召开了设计会议，具体布置了一九五四年度工程设计任务。一九五四年华北国营煤矿有百分之六十八点八的基本建设投资要放在矿井建设上，将要建设四对年产三十万吨的小斜井；并有很多矿井要进行改建、恢复或局部改建。随着这些工程的继续完成，明年华北区煤产量将比一九五三年增加百分之二十以上，一九五五年又要比一九五四年增产二百万吨以上。在生产发展的基础上，要相应地进行福利工程建筑，一九五四年仅工人住宅一项就有十九万五千平方公尺。因此，一九五四年华北煤矿系统的基本建设任务是很重要和艰巨的。
    为明年及时和顺利施工，设计会议决定在今年第四季度要完成一九五四年工程设计的百分之二十八，明年第一季度完成百分之三十八点八，除占百分之一的个别工程须第三季度完成设计外，全部设计工作要求在第二季度完成。会上根据工程的轻重缓急、设计资料和设备器材准备情况、设计与施工力量，把工程项目排了队，确定了具体进度和负责人。会议强调指出：要保证很好地完成设计任务，设计人员必须接受苏联的先进设计思想和经验，并从总结具体设计中批判不正确的思想，树立先进的正确的设计思想。并要求各设计单位建立资料调查研究制、设计责任制、联系制度和校对会审等四项制度，以防止一九五三年搜集资料多头负责、校对会审粗枝大叶等现象继续发生。为了加速进度，提高质量，要求各单位逐步采用标准设计，并通过带徒弟的方法培养设计力量，以保证按期完成一九五四年的设计任务。（华北煤矿管理局）
