Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 7th: The explanation work will be postponed on the 7th at the request of the Indian Custodial Forces, as the 7th is the Indian "Festival of Lights." The explanation work for this day will be moved to November 15th (Sunday).

Twenty-four days have passed since the explanation work began. During this period, the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" have been constantly and seriously undermined by the US side. Because the US-directed Li and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in the camps prevented prisoners of war from leaving the camps to listen to explanations, the explanation work was interrupted for fourteen days. The time for the Korean and Chinese side to conduct explanation work, including the four hours of broadcasting to prisoners of war, totaled only forty hours. These forty hours of explanation were also conducted under the various interferences of the so-called "representatives" of the US side and the Li and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. Even so, a total of sixty-three prisoners of war have applied for repatriation during the explanation process. Including the one hundred and seventy-five prisoners of war who escaped the control of the secret agents and demanded repatriation, two hundred and thirty-eight have returned. Each of them exposed the conspiracy of the US side to sabotage the explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war in Panmunjom to the whole world. Each of them is living proof that the US side's lie of prisoners of war "refusing repatriation" has been completely defeated.

Because the US side is afraid that more prisoners of war will demand repatriation, it is directing secret agents to implement new sabotage tactics. Because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission sent back both explained and unexplained prisoners of war to the camps on the 4th and 5th, the secret agents took the opportunity to prevent prisoners of war who had not heard the explanations from coming out to listen to the explanations, causing the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side to be suspended again from the 6th.

The United States Information Service fabricated a rumor on the 6th, saying that the Korean and Chinese side originally planned to explain to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army on the 6th, but changed to explain to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers at the last minute, thus making the explanation work impossible to proceed. This is obviously an attempt to shirk the responsibility for the US side's instigation of secret agents to sabotage the explanation work. In fact, the explanation work plan submitted by the Korean and Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission before 10:00 am on the 5th stated that the explanation work will continue to be conducted for the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Camp No. 22 on November 6th; the plan's footnote stated: if the explanation of the prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 ends on the 5th, the explanation work will be conducted for the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 39 on the 6th. In the explanation work on the 5th, only one hundred and twenty-four prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 listened to the explanation, so of course the explanation work should continue to be conducted for the prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 on the 6th.

Now the facts have once again proved that if effective measures are not taken against the US secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camps, they will intensify their sabotage, making the explanation work impossible to proceed, thereby realizing the conspiracy of the US side to sabotage the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the armistice agreement.

### 七日解释工作应印度部队请求延期进行  美方正采取新的破坏策略阻挠战俘听取解

    七日解释工作应印度部队请求延期进行
    美方正采取新的破坏策略阻挠战俘听取解释
    【新华社开城七日电】七日是印度的“千灯节”，朝中方面应印度看管部队的请求，在七日不进行解释工作。这一天的解释工作将移到十一月十五日（星期日）进行。
    从解释工作开始以来，已经过了二十四天。在这个期间，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”遭到了美方不断的严重破坏。由于美方指挥营场内的李、蒋特务阻止战俘出营场听取解释，解释工作先后中断了十四天。朝中方面进行解释工作的时间，连向战俘进行广播的四小时计算在内，一共不过四十个小时。就是这四十个小时的解释也是在美方的所谓“代表”和李、蒋特务的各种各样的干扰下进行的。纵然如此，在解释过程中，已一共有六十三名战俘申请遣返。加上逃脱特务控制要求遣返的一百七十五名战俘在内，遣返归来的已有二百三十八名。他们之中的每一个人都在板门店向全世界揭露了美方破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，他们每一个人都是美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的弥天大谎遭到彻底失败的活生生的证据。
    美方因为害怕有更多的战俘要求遣返，正在指挥特务实行新的破坏策略。由于中立国遣返委员会在四、五两日将已经解释过的和尚未解释的战俘一起送回营场，以致特务分子有机可乘，不让未听解释的战俘出来听取解释，使朝中方面的解释工作从六日起又陷于停顿。
    美国新闻处在六日造谣说，朝中方面原要在六日向朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释，而在最后一分钟改为向志愿军被俘人员进行解释，因而使解释工作不能进行。这显然是企图推卸美方指使特务破坏解释工作的责任。事实上，朝中方面在五日上午十时前提交给中立国遣返委员会的解释工作计划，说明将在十一月六日继续向第二十二号营场的志愿军被俘人员进行解释；计划附注说：如果对二十二号营场战俘的解释在五日结束，六日则向第三十九号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。而在五日的解释工作中，二十二号营场仅有一百二十四名战俘听了解释，因此六日当然仍应对二十二号营场的战俘继续进行解释。
    现在事实已经又一次证明，如果对战俘营中的美方特务不采取有效措施，他们势将变本加厉地进行破坏，使解释工作无法进行，从而也就实现美方破坏停战协定中“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的阴谋。
