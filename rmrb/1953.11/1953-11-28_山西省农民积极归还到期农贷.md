    Shanxi Province Farmers Actively Return Overdue Agricultural Loans
    After selling surplus grain and cotton to the state, farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively repaying state loans that are due. The loans recovered by the People's Bank of China branches in various parts of Shanxi Province account for more than 80 percent of the total loans due; in counties such as Yuanqu, the recovered loans account for more than 90 percent of the total due.
    In the work of recovering overdue loans, the People's Bank of China branches in various parts of Shanxi Province have conscientiously implemented the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on issuing agricultural loans, and recovered all or part of the loans according to the specific circumstances. For poor farmers who are truly unable to repay the loans, they were given partial or full deferred repayment consideration.
    People's Bank of China branches in various parts of Shanxi Province have come up with many ways to cooperate with grain purchase work and facilitate farmers' loan repayments. People's Bank of China branches and supply and marketing cooperatives in Wanquan, Jiangxian, and Xiangning have jointly formed working groups to go deep into the countryside to purchase grain and recover overdue loans at the same time, so that farmers "can repay loans without leaving the village, and grain sales do not delay work," which is welcomed by the farmers. Two working groups jointly organized by the Wanquan County People's Bank of China branch and the cooperative purchased 45,000 jin of wheat and recovered 45 million yuan in loans in four villages in seven days. In the work of recovering loans, cadres of the People's Bank of China in many areas publicized the significance of the state's purchase of grain and the state's policy of issuing agricultural loans to farmers, and encouraged farmers to actively sell surplus grain to the state and automatically repay loans. Li Jinchao, a farmer in Shangdong Village, Fushan County, initially did not want to sell his surplus grain and repay the loan because he was reluctant to sell. After the cadres of the People's Bank of China and the cadres of the grain purchase working group explained to him the benefits of selling surplus grain to support national construction and the state's policy of issuing agricultural loans, he sold his surplus grain to the state and repaid all overdue loans.

    山西省农民积极归还到期农贷
    山西省各地农民把余粮、棉花卖给国家以后，积极归还国家到期贷款。中国人民银行山西省各地支行已经收回的贷款，占应收回贷款总数的百分之八十以上；垣曲等县收回的贷款占应收回总数的百分之九十以上。
    中国人民银行山西省各地支行，在收回到期贷款工作中，都认真贯彻了中央人民政府政务院关于发放农业贷款的指示，根据具体情况收回贷款的全部或一部；对于确实无力偿还贷款的贫困农民，分别给予部分或全部缓期偿还的照顾。
    山西省各地人民银行支行想出许多办法配合购粮工作，便利农民归还贷款。万泉、绛县、乡宁等人民银行支行和供销合作社联合组成工作组，深入农村，一面收购粮食，一面收回到期贷款，使农民
  “还款不出村，卖粮不误工”，受到了农民的欢迎。万泉县人民银行支行和合作社联合组织的两个工作组，七天内在四个村就收购了四万五千斤小麦，收回贷款四千五百万元。在收回贷款工作中，许多地区的人民银行干部向农民宣传了国家收购粮食的意义和国家发放农业贷款的政策，启发农民积极把余粮卖给国家并自动归还贷款。浮山县上东村农民李金朝，开始时因为有惜售思想，不愿卖出余粮，偿还贷款。经人民银行干部和购粮工作组的干部向他说明了卖余粮支援国家建设的好处，和国家发放农业贷款的政策以后，他便把余粮卖给国家，归还了全部到期贷款。　　　（侯应邦）
