    North China Administrative Committee Holds Expanded Meeting
    Deploying Work in the Region Based on the General Line
    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China Administrative Committee convened its second expanded committee meeting on November 23rd and 24th, focusing on discussing how to improve and elevate various tasks in the North China region under the beacon of the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period.

    Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, delivered a report at the meeting on the transmission of the general line and general tasks, and the current work tasks in the North China region. Vice Chairman Liu Xiufeng gave a report on the specific tasks of the North China region in realizing national industrialization. Vice Chairman Zhang Su gave a report on grain policy, and Vice Chairman Li Zhuchen gave a report on capitalist industry and commerce taking the path of state capitalism. The attending committee members discussed these reports and unanimously felt that the proposal of the general line and general tasks of the transition period had added new impetus to current tasks, and expressed their determination to realize the general line of the state during the transition period with practical actions.

    The meeting conducted specific research on how to implement the general line and general tasks in the work of the North China region.

    The meeting first pointed out that the North China region had achieved great success in realizing the general line and general tasks of the transition period in the past four years. After completing various reform tasks during the recovery period, the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in 1953 is expected to increase by 24 percent compared to 1952. The outstanding achievement of the socialist transformation of agriculture is the new upsurge of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Half of the farmers in the region have organized 1.1 million mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives of various forms. The agricultural production cooperatives that began to be piloted nearly three years ago have developed from 82 to 6,300, with 120,000 farm households participating. The proportion of increased grain production each year generally averages 15 to 20 percent, and the income of cooperative members is one to one and a half times higher than that of individual farmers. In areas where agricultural production cooperatives have been established for a longer period and work has been done well, poverty has been eliminated, and farmers no longer need state relief. About 7 percent of the 170,000 handicraft households in various towns and cities have participated in handicraft production cooperatives. Various forms of state capitalism have also developed. According to statistics, 70 percent of the total output value of private industry in Tianjin and 54 percent in Beijing is from accepting state processing orders. Due to the change in production relations, the production capacity of joint state-private enterprises such as Huaxin Textile Factory and Yaohua Glass Factory has increased rapidly. Huaxin Textile Factory has newly expanded its spindles by 20,000, and its profit in 1952 increased by more than 13 times compared to 1949.

    The meeting pointed out that under the brilliant light of the general line and general tasks, the socialist economy growing in the national economy and the agriculture, handicrafts, and private capitalist economy being transformed will further exert its new power. Because the spirit of the general line and general tasks cannot be understood by all the people in one morning, it is first necessary to further vigorously carry out extensive and systematic propaganda and education work throughout the region. It is necessary to make the ideas of loving industrialization, loving cooperation, welcoming the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and striving for a bright socialist future, become the thoughts of all the people and become the new social customs.

    The meeting pointed out two aspects that should be paid attention to in the development of socialist industry: on the one hand, establishing new industrial bases; on the other hand, exploring the potential of existing enterprise equipment. In establishing new industrial bases, the current focus should be on doing a good job in surveying and designing work, and cultivating technical personnel and cadres, and planning urban construction work to serve the new industry. The basic construction team has gradually grown stronger over the past year. In winter, it is necessary to seize the training work and cultivate backbones so that they can draw strength to support the construction of industrial bases. To tap the potential of existing enterprise equipment, the current focus should be on deeply developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy. On the basis of improving business management, we should strive to overfulfill the national plan and conscientiously do a good job in compiling the 1954 plan, and do all the preparations for welcoming the new production tasks of 1954. The meeting also pointed out that in realizing the above two aspects of tasks, it is necessary to pay attention to implementing the principle of focusing on the construction of heavy industry and developing the light industry needed by the people accordingly, and it is necessary to actively and actively transfer another group of outstanding cadres to participate in industrial construction.

    The meeting pointed out that in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, in 1954, the mutual aid and cooperation teams with the participation of 6 million farm households should be further expanded. In carrying out this work, special attention should be paid to transforming temporary mutual aid into regular mutual aid; and transforming mutual aid teams with good conditions into agricultural production cooperatives. It is required that the number of agricultural production cooperatives should be doubled or more on the existing basis. The meeting pointed out that both rash advances and stagnation are wrong on this issue. In the country's first five-year plan, agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives such as Li Shunda's in Shanxi Province and agricultural production cooperatives such as Geng Changsuo's in Hebei Province should be developed in large numbers. The meeting believes that the important guarantee for realizing agricultural cooperation is to do a good job in supply and marketing cooperatives, do a good job in bank savings and loan and credit cooperatives, and do a good job in purchasing grain. It is necessary to enable farmers to realize the benefits of cooperation from their own personal experience, to realize the benefits of the worker-peasant alliance, to get rid of the encroachment of capitalism, and to embark on the happy socialist road. For the socialist transformation of handicrafts, it is also necessary to guide handicrafts to take the road of cooperation. The meeting decided to convene a handicraft work conference in December to specifically discuss this issue.

    The meeting also called for continuing to summarize the experience of state capitalism work carried out in capitalist industry and commerce in the past four years, so as to formulate a comprehensive plan for the economic transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the next three or four years on the existing basis. We must strengthen leadership for the ongoing production increase and economy campaigns in private enterprises. Major cities must establish special committees to lead the campaigns. Through the campaigns, we must take a step forward in improving the operation and management of private enterprises.

    Finally, the meeting pointed out that the people of North China contributed their strength under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong in the great cause of the New Democratic Revolution in the past 30 years. In the future, in the greater cause of implementing the general line and general tasks of the transition period and striving for the arrival of a bright socialist society, they will surely contribute greater manpower and material resources.

    The meeting was successfully concluded after Chairman Liu Lantao delivered the closing speech.

    华北行政委员会召开扩大会议
    根据总路线部署全区工作
    【本报讯】华北行政委员会在十一月二十三、二十四两日，召开第二次委员会扩大会议，着重讨论了如何在国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的灯塔照耀下，改进与提高华北区各项工作的问题。
    华北行政委员会刘澜涛主席在会上作了总路线总任务的传达和华北区当前工作任务的报告，刘秀峰副主席作了华北区在实现国家工业化中具体任务的报告，张苏副主席作了关于粮食政策的报告，李烛尘副主席作了关于资本主义工商业走国家资本主义道路的报告。到会委员讨论了这些报告，一致感觉到过渡时期的总路线总任务的提出，使当前各项工作，增添了新的动力，并表示决心以实际行动，实现国家过渡时期总路线。
    会议对于如何在华北区的工作中贯彻总路线总任务的问题，作了具体研究。
    会议首先指出了华北区四年来在实现过渡时期总路线总任务方面已取得了很大成绩。国营和地方国营厂矿，在完成了恢复时期的各项改革工作后，一九五三年的总产值，预计比一九五二年将提高百分之二十四。农业的社会主义改造，所表现的突出成就是互助合作运动的新高涨，全区已有半数农民组织了一百一十万个各种形式的互助组与农业生产合作社。近三年来开始试办的农业生产合作社已由八十二个发展到六千三百个，有十二万农户参加，每年增产粮食的比例，一般平均为百分之十五到百分之二十，社员的收入比单干农民有提高一倍到一倍半的。农业生产合作社建立较久和工作做得较好的地区，消灭了贫困，农民不再需要国家的救济。各城镇十七万户手工业，参加到手工业生产合作社中的约占百分之七。各种不同形式的国家资本主义也都有发展。据统计，天津市私营工业总产值中有百分之七十、北京市有百分之五十四，是接受国家加工订货的。公私合营的华新纺织厂和耀华玻璃厂等，由于生产关系的改变，生产力提高很快。华新纺织厂新扩大纱锭两万个，一九五二年的利润较一九四九年提高了十三倍多。
    会议指出在总路线总任务的光辉照耀下，国民经济中正在成长着的社会主义经济与正在改造中的农业、手工业与私人资本主义经济，必将进一步发挥出它的新生力量。由于总路线总任务的精神，不可能在一个早晨就为全体人民所理解，因而首先要在全区范围内进一步大张旗鼓地进行广泛系统的宣传教育工作。要使热爱工业化，热爱合作化，欢迎对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，为实现美好的社会主义远景而奋斗的思想，成为全体人民的思想，成为社会的新风尚。
    会议指出了发展社会主义工业中应注意的两个方面：一方面是建立新的工业基地；一方面是发掘旧有企业设备的潜力。建立新的工业基地，当前应注意的是做好勘测、设计工作和培养技术人员与干部，规划好为新工业服务的城市建设工作。基本建设的队伍一年来已逐渐壮大，冬季要抓紧整训工作，培养骨干，以便能抽出力量支援工业基地的建设。发掘旧有企业设备潜力，在当前所应注意的是深入展开增产节约竞赛，在改善经营管理的基础上，争取超额完成国家计划，并认真做好编制一九五四年计划的工作，为迎接一九五四年的新生产任务做好一切准备工作。会议还指出在实现上述两方面任务时，必须注意贯彻重点建设重工业，与相应地发展人民所需要的轻工业的原则，必须主动、积极地再抽调一批优秀的干部参加工业建设。
    会议指出在推动农业的社会主义改造方面，一九五四年要使原有六百万农户参加的互助合作队伍更加扩大起来。在进行此项工作中，特别应注意把临时性的互助转为经常性的互助；把条件好的互助组转变为农业生产合作社。要求农业生产合作社在现在基础上增加一倍或一倍以上。会议指出，在这个问题上急躁冒进和停滞不进都是不对的。在国家的第一个五年计划中，类如山西省李顺达的农林畜牧生产合作社，河北省耿长锁的农业生产合作社要大量发展。会议认为，实现农业合作化的重要保证，是做好供销合作社的工作，做好银行储贷与信贷合作社的工作，做好收购粮食的工作。要使农民从自己的切身体验中认识到合作化的好处，认识工农联盟的好处，摆脱资本主义的侵害，走幸福的社会主义大路。对手工业的社会主义改造，同样要引导手工业走合作化的道路。会议决定在十二月份内召开手工业工作会议，具体讨论这方面的问题。
    会议还要求继续总结四年来在资本主义工商业中进行的国家资本主义工作的经验，以便在已有的基础上，订出在今后三、四年内对资本主义工商业进行经济改造的全盘计划。对于目前正在开展着的私营企业的增产节约竞赛，要加强领导，大城市要建立领导竞赛的专门委员会，要通过竞赛，使私营企业的经营管理提高一步。
    会议最后指出：华北人民在已往三十年的新民主主义革命的伟大事业中，在中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席领导下，贡献了自己的力量，今后在贯彻过渡时期的总路线总任务，争取美好的社会主义社会到来的更伟大事业中，必将贡献出更大的人力物力。
    会议由刘澜涛主席致闭幕词后胜利结束。
