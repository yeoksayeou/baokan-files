Steel plants in Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Tangshan and other places
Promoting Mechanization and Automation Movement Achieves Preliminary Results

    Major steel plants in North China have achieved preliminary results in learning and promoting the experience of the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel in the mechanization and automation movement during the production increase and economy practice competition.

    The mechanization and automation research group of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, led by Hou Decheng, has successfully researched and transformed the following new equipment: blast furnace automated material line recorder, automatic brake, furnace temperature automatic recorder, gas pressure automatic recorder, water pressure automatic alarm, core extractor, gearless saw, etc., totaling sixteen items. Workers at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant used scrap steel to improve and install fifteen larger production equipment items, including a coking machine, automated equipment for No. 1 coking furnace, a still for coking by-products, an oil-water separator, and a water press, and also manufactured an electric crane. Tangshan Steel Plant successfully tested sixteen-millimeter and nineteen-millimeter positive and reverse coilers and a pusher.

    The success of these transformed and newly created equipment has promoted a new atmosphere in production. For example, after the positive and reverse coilers at Tangshan Steel Plant were put into production, production greatly increased, and from August 1st to 20th, the output exceeded the target by 13.2%, the quality quota all exceeded the indicators, and the equilibrium rate reached 99.3%. After the electric crane at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was put into production, it greatly improved the working conditions of the material handling workers in the steelmaking department, the phenomenon of open hearth furnaces stopping to wait for materials has been completely resolved, and the smelting time has been shortened, and output has increased. After No. 1 automated coking furnace was put into production, it ended the harsh working conditions of coking workers for fourteen years, saved 70% of the labor force, and greatly improved the production efficiency of the coking furnace compared to before. All of these provide a reliable guarantee for completing this year's national plan and increasing production and practicing economy.

    Currently, these units have all made plans to further promote the experience of small rolling mills. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant plans to complete the improvement of eight equipment items such as air pressure flowmeters recently; Tangshan Steel Plant plans to continue to test and promote automatic devices such as vertical coilers, automatic induction devices, reheating furnace pusher, and electric guide plate automatic cutting machines within this year; Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has decided to use 500 tons of scrap steel to transform old equipment within this year and has made specific plans.

    石景山、太原、唐山等地钢铁厂
    推行机械化、自动化运动取得初步成绩
    华北区各主要钢铁厂在增产节约竞赛中学习与推广鞍钢小型轧钢厂机械化、自动化运动的经验已取得初步成绩。
    石景山钢铁厂侯德成等机械化、自动化研究小组已研究、改造成功的新设备有：高炉自动化料线记录器、自动抱闸、炉温自动记录器、煤气压力自动记录器、水压自动警报器、退芯器、无齿锯等十六件；太原钢铁厂职工利用废钢材改进和安装了炼焦机、第一号炼焦炉自动化设备、炼焦副产用的蒸镏釜、油水分离器和压水机等十五种较大的生产设备，还制造了一部电动吊车；唐山钢厂试验十六公厘、十九公厘的正、反围盘和推钢机获得成功。
    这些改造和新创造的设备的成功，促使生产上出现了新气象。如唐山钢厂正、反围盘投入生产后，生产大大提高，八月一日至二十日产量超额完成百分之十三点二，质量定额全部超过指标，均衡率达到百分之九十九点三。太原钢铁厂电动吊车投入生产后，大大改善了炼钢部运料工人的劳动条件，平炉停工待料的现象已被彻底解决，并缩短了冶炼时间，增加了产量。第一号自动化炼焦炉投入生产后，结束了炼焦工人十四年来恶劣劳动状况，节省了百分之七十的劳动力，并使炼焦炉生产效率较前提高很多。这些都对完成今年国家计划和增产节约任务提供了可靠的保证。
    目前这些单位都作出了进一步推广小型轧钢厂经验的计划。石景山钢铁厂计划最近完成风压流量计等八项设备改进；唐山钢厂计划在今年以内继续试验与推广立围盘、自动诱导装置、再热炉推出机、电动导板自动切断机等自动化装置；太原钢铁厂决定在今年内利用五百吨废钢料改造旧设备，并作出具体计划。（程振绪）
