First of all, please allow me to express my gratitude to all the Chinese friends present today and to the leaders of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association for holding this grand celebration of the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The Soviet people cherish the friendship of the Chinese people and believe that the unity between our two peoples is eternal, unbreakable, and unshakable. This unity is not only in the interests of China and the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of all the people of the world.

The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union celebrate the thirty-sixth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the greatest historical event that marks a fundamental shift in the history of mankind.

For the first time in history, the oppressed and exploited masses eliminated the rule of landlords and capitalists and established Soviet power—the power of the working people.

The Soviet socialist country born out of the October Revolution has demonstrated its great and indestructible vitality. It has victoriously weathered all hardships and trials. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have built a multinational country, created a powerful socialist economy and the most advanced culture in the world, and are now victoriously transitioning from socialism to communism.

The working people of all countries of the world watch the Soviet Union with deep trust and hope, as it paves the right path towards a bright future for all mankind.

This year, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people suffered the most grievous loss: the passing of the great Stalin, the brilliant successor to Lenin's cause. The enemies of the Soviet people hoped that the Soviet state would be weakened and that confusion and wavering would be caused in the ranks of our Party, but all their plans have failed.

The Soviet people are more closely united around their beloved Communist Party and around the Central Committee of the Party.

The Central Committee firmly and confidently leads our country forward, towards new victories along the road of communist construction.

	Achievements in the Development of Industry and Agriculture

The Soviet people greet the thirty-sixth anniversary of the October Revolution with great achievements in industrial development. In this short period from the perspective of human history, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have transformed a backward agricultural country into a strong socialist industrial power.

The Communist Party adopted a firm policy of national industrialization in 1925 and, for many years thereafter, organized and inspired the Soviet people to complete several five-year plans for the development of the national economy. The Soviet people had to overcome many difficulties on the road to national industrialization. It was necessary to find funds through the strictest methods of economy in order to develop heavy industry in a short period of time. The Party had to wage the fiercest struggle against domestic and foreign enemies who frantically resisted the Party's general line, doing everything in their power to undermine the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, organizing sabotage and slowdowns, and refusing to sell necessary equipment, and so on.

In 1941, the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people was interrupted by the German fascist bandits, and the country had to temporarily halt the development of peaceful economic sectors and wage the bloodiest and most destructive war in the history of all wars for four years.

Despite these serious obstacles and difficulties, the Soviet people, inspired and organized by the Communist Party, have increased industrial production twenty-eightfold in the twenty-eight years since the Party's Fourteenth Congress. Furthermore, the production of means of production in our country has increased approximately fifty-fourfold, and the production of consumer goods has increased elevenfold. Compared with 1924-25, steel production has increased twentyfold, coal—eighteenfold, and electricity—forty-fourfold. In 1953, steel production will be over 38 million tons, coal extraction will be over 320 million tons, and electricity production will be 133 billion kilowatt-hours.

The Party started industrialization by first developing heavy industry. This was a completely correct, wise, and far-sighted policy. Without coal, oil, steel, electricity, chemicals, and machine manufacturing, the Soviet state, which was constantly surrounded by hostile capitalist countries until the Second World War, would not have been able to defend its independence.

The Communist Party will continue to put forward the task of developing heavy industry, which is the foundation of the socialist economy and the basis for further consolidation of national defense.

Now, on the basis of the achievements already made in the development of heavy industry, the task is put forward to rapidly increase the development speed of various departments of the industry producing consumer goods, in order to largely guarantee the people's food and industrial products within two or three years, improve the quality of goods, and reduce their prices. At the same time, the task is also put forward to greatly expand trade, improve trade organization, and supply goods to residents in the most remote areas in a timely manner.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved great successes in agricultural development. The old system of 25 million scattered and fragmented agricultural economies in the countryside has now been replaced by the establishment and consolidation of the world's largest and most mechanized socialist agricultural system.

Our socialist agriculture now includes 94,000 collective farms, 8,590 agricultural machinery stations, and 4,700 state farms. There are now 969,000 tractors and 255,000 combine harvesters in the agricultural machinery stations. New types of tractors and agricultural machinery have been created.

Based on collective farms and state farms, the output and commercial rate of socialist agriculture are increasing. For example, from 1926-27 to 1952-53, the commercial products of agriculture, in terms of grain, increased from 10.3 million tons to 40.4 million tons, in terms of potatoes, from 3 million tons to 12.5 million tons, and in terms of meat (calculated by the weight of unslaughtered livestock), from 2.4 million tons to 5 million tons.

However, the Soviet people do not stop at the achievements already made. The Central Committee of the Party adopted detailed resolutions on further development of agriculture at the September Plenum, concerning increasing the production of agricultural products for residents and agricultural raw materials for light industry and food industry.

	Improvement of the Material Welfare and Cultural Level of the Working People

Thanks to the constant concern of the Party and the government, the welfare and cultural level of the Soviet working people are constantly improving. The real income of workers and staff has greatly increased during the post-war period. In 1952, the income of each worker increased by 68 percent compared with 1940, and many times higher compared with pre-revolutionary Russia. In 1953, the real wages of workers and staff and the income of collective farm members have further increased.

During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the real wages of workers and staff will be increased by another 35 percent, and the income of collective farm members will be increased by 40 percent.

The task has been put forward to greatly increase the construction of houses, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and hospitals. The allocations for these aspects stipulated in the 1953 national economic plan are 30 to 50 percent more than last year.

Satisfying the growing material and cultural needs of residents is the most important task of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

	International Situation and Soviet Foreign Policy

While engaging in peaceful and creative labor, the Soviet people believe that it is their sacred responsibility to actively struggle for the defense of peace, for the development of economic and cultural ties with the people of other countries, and for the expansion of the peaceful, progressive, and democratic camp. The consistently peace-loving nature of Soviet foreign policy is derived from the essence of the new socialist social system.

The October Revolution forever eliminated the exploiting classes in our country, and also eliminated the forces they represented, which launched predatory wars between countries for their own enrichment. The struggle for peace and practical cooperation, and for the security of the people of all countries is the general line of Soviet foreign policy.

Due to the active participation of millions of working people in the struggle for peace against war-mongers, and due to the great achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, the international tension has been somewhat eased.

The victory in Korea is an extremely significant event, which proves that the strength of the democratic camp is growing and becoming increasingly consolidated. The heroic Korean People's Army and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the boasted and fully armed American army. Due to its military failure and the widespread public opinion against the aggressors, American imperialism was forced to cease fire in Korea and further conduct negotiations on convening a political conference.

The Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have won the praise of progressive mankind all over the world with their perseverance and bravery. Progressive mankind has once again been convinced from the example of Korea that when the people defend their freedom, independence, and just cause, they are invincible.

The scale of the struggle of the working people of Asia, Africa, and South America in colonial and dependent countries for liberation from imperialist oppression and for improving their living standards is expanding day by day.

But we cannot ignore the fact that imperialist aggressor forces are attempting to undermine the policy of settling disputes by peaceful means at any cost. Those aggressive groups, headed by American monopoly organizations, stubbornly maintain international tension, because they are afraid that if events develop along this line, then they will have to end the arms race; and the arms race brings them huge profits and creates artificial increase of the operating rates in the industry. The American ruling group, pursuing maximum profits and vying for world hegemony, hinders the peaceful settlement of disputes. They are frantically preparing for new wars, establishing American military bases around the democratic camp countries, intensifying the revival of militarism in West Germany to transform it into a source of war in Europe, and attempting to revive Japanese militarism to serve as a source of war in Asia. American monopoly capitalists intend to use the people of these countries to attack people's democratic countries, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China.

For four years, the American ruling group has been acting irrationally, trying its best to convince the world that the great China, with nearly 600 million people, does not exist. However, China is now a great power, a powerful factor for peace and progress in Asia and the Pacific region.

The aggressors are unwilling to admit the tremendous changes that have taken place in Asia. However, it is very clear that Asia is no longer the Asia before the Second World War, when the imperialist bandits wantonly plundered and oppressed colonial and semi-colonial countries. The old Asia, which suffered from the terrible oppression and enslavement as fate, has now become a thing of the past. The ideas of the Great October Revolution have inspired the people of colonial and dependent countries to struggle for freedom and national independence of their countries. The era in which imperialists could plunder the people at will has ended forever. Now it is more difficult for imperialists to realize their aggressive plans.

There is no doubt that all the conspiracies and arrogant attempts of American imperialism and its vassal states to dominate the world are doomed to failure, because in contrast to the dying capitalist world of aggression and American robbers is the powerful progressive peaceful and democratic camp. The achievements of the democratic camp once again prove that the socialist system and the people's democratic system, compared with the capitalist system, have indisputable and great superiority; the capitalist system is destined to plunge the working people into poverty, unemployment, and suffering. The people of the democratic camp have firmly embarked on the road to a new life and will never leave this road.

The working people of capitalist and colonial countries are unwilling to live that life of poverty and doom in which they have no rights. They are strengthening their struggle against American monopoly capitalists and war-mongers, and have come to the correct conclusion that they must do everything in their power to consolidate the world peace, progress, and democratic camp.

The selfless struggle of hundreds of millions of people to defend peace will undoubtedly achieve final victory, and the cause of peace will eventually win.

	Further Consolidation of Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union has received the full support and cooperation of all peace-loving democratic countries in its domestic and foreign policies, and has gained the moral support of progressive mankind all over the world. It must be pointed out that the sincere friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union is of great significance. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up an era of sincere brotherly relations between China and the Soviet Union. The unbreakable and eternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is a great contribution to the cause of peace and to ensuring the safety of the people of all ethnic groups in the Far East and the world. In the past year, the friendship between our two peoples has been further consolidated, enhanced, and is continuing to develop. Economic and cultural ties have been strengthened, and there is a systematic exchange of experience between our two countries. In 1953, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China signed an agreement on Soviet technical assistance to the People's Republic of China in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, which plays a significant role in further consolidating and developing economic and cultural ties.

Please allow me to express my gratitude to Chinese friends for the extremely high evaluation of the work of Soviet experts serving in various enterprises and institutions in the People's Republic of China. The achievements made by Soviet experts in their work are primarily due to the exceptional concern and care that the Soviet people receive in the People's Republic of China. Chinese friends have created all the necessary conditions for Soviet experts to carry out effective work. This makes it the responsibility of our experts to work better in the future and to more fully share their knowledge and experience with Chinese friends. There is no doubt that Soviet experts will take all measures to faithfully fulfill the responsibilities they bear.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is doing a tremendous job in expanding cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, please allow me to express my deep gratitude to it. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has done a lot of work in introducing the economic and cultural achievements of the Soviet people to the Chinese people, and has also done a lot of work in introducing the achievements of the Chinese people to the Soviet people.

The Soviet people are showing great concern for everything that is happening in the People's Republic of China, and are heartily delighted by the achievements made by the Chinese people. Comrade Malenkov expressed the feelings of the Soviet people for the sincere friendship of the Chinese people in his congratulatory telegram on the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Comrade Malenkov mentioned:

"The progress made by the People's Republic of China in all aspects has made all progressive mankind deeply satisfied and proud. No force in the world can prevent the Chinese people from advancing along the road of national upsurge and national prosperity."

The Soviet people have set themselves the task of more widely developing economic and cultural ties with the Chinese people and further consolidating the unbreakable and eternal friendship with the Chinese people for the benefit of our two peoples and for the benefit of all mankind.

Long live the thirty-sixth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the great Chinese people and their leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the unbreakable, eternal, fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and China! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏联大使库兹?佐夫的讲话

专栏：

　　苏联大使库兹?佐夫的讲话
    请允许我首先向所有今天在座的中国朋友们、向中苏友好协会的领导人表示谢意，感谢你们举办这一次伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年的庆祝大会。
    苏联人民珍重中国人民的友谊，并且认为我们两国人民间的团结是永恒的、牢不可破的和不可动摇的。这种团结不但是符合中苏两国的利益，而且也符合全世界人民的利益。
    苏联各族人民庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命这个最伟大的历史事件的三十六周年，这个历史事件标志着全世界人类历史中的根本转变。
    被压迫和被剥削的群众在历史上第一次消灭了地主和资本家的统治，建立了苏维埃政权——劳动人民的政权。
    十月革命所诞生的苏维埃社会主义国家表现了自己的伟大的不可摧毁的生命力量。它胜利地经历了一切艰苦考验。苏联人民，在共产党领导下，建成了多民族的国家，创造了强大的社会主义经济和世界上最先进的文化，而现在正在胜利地实行由社会主义向共产主义的过渡。
    世界各国劳动人民怀着深切的信任和希望，注视着这个为全人类铺平了走向光明未来的正确道路的苏联。
    今年苏联共产党和苏联人民遭遇了最沉痛的损失，列宁事业的天才继承人——伟大的斯大林逝世了。苏维埃人民的敌人希望苏维埃国家将会削弱，希望在我们党的队伍里将会引起混乱与动摇，但是他们所有的打算都破产了。
    苏联人民更加紧密地团结在自己亲爱的共产党的周围，团结在党中央委员会的周围。
    党中央坚定地、满怀信心地引导着我们的国家前进，沿着共产主义建设的道路走向新的胜利。
      工农业发展方面的成就
    苏联人民用工业发展方面的巨大成就来迎接十月革命的三十六周年。在这个从人类历史看来的一个短短的时期内，苏联人民在共产党领导下把一个落后的农业国家变成了一个强有力的社会主义的工业强国。
    共产党在一九二五年采取了国家工业化的坚定的方针，在此后，在许多年里组织了并且鼓舞了苏联人民完成发展国民经济的几个五年计划。苏联人民曾必须克服国家工业化道路上面的不少困难。必须用最严格的节约方法找到资金，以便在短期内发展起重工业。党曾必须和国内外的敌人进行最激烈的斗争，这些敌人对于党的总路线疯狂抵抗，用全力来破坏苏联的社会主义建设，组织了破坏、怠工，并且拒绝出卖必需的设备等等。
    一九四一年，苏联人民的和平创造性的劳动曾经被德国法西斯匪帮所打断，国家曾必须暂时停止和平经济部门的发展，并在四年期间内进行历史上所有战争中流血牺牲与破坏最大的一次战争。
    尽管有这些严重的阻碍与困难，为共产党所鼓舞与组织的苏联人民，自党的第十四次代表大会以后，在二十八年之间，增加了工业生产二十八倍。并且，使我国生产资料的生产大约增长了五十四倍，人民消费品的生产增长了十一倍。现在和一九二四—二五年比较起来，钢的生产增长了二十倍，煤——十八倍，电力——四十四倍。一九五三年钢的生产将为三千八百万吨以上，煤的采掘量将为三亿二千万吨以上，电力生产一千三百三十亿瓩时。
    党是先发展重工业来开始工业化。这是一个完全正确的、英明而有远见的政策。如果没有煤、石油、钢铁、电力、化学、机器制造业，那么，直到第二次世界大战为止，始终被敌对的资本主义国家所包围着的苏维埃国家，就不能够保卫自己的独立。
    共产党今后仍提出发展重工业的任务，重工业就是社会主义经济基础之基础，是进一步巩固国防的基础。
    现在，在发展重工业方面所已获得的成就的基础之上，提出迅速提高生产人民消费品工业的各部门发展速度的任务，以便于在两三年内大量保证居民的粮食和工业品，提高物品的质量，并且降低其价格。同时又提出了大大扩展贸易，改善贸易组织，及时对最边远地区居民供应物品的任务。
    苏联人民在共产党领导下，在农业发展方面获得了巨大的成就。过去在乡村有二千五百万个分散零碎的农业经济的旧制度，现在代替他们的有世界上规模最大的机械化程度最高的社会主义农业的制度建立起来并且巩固起来了。
    我国的社会主义农业现在包括有九万四千个集体农庄、八千五百九十个农业机器站和四千七百个国营农场。现在在农业机器站里有九十六万九千架拖拉机，二十五万五千架康拜因机。新式拖拉机和农业机器都创造出来了。
    在集体农庄和国营农场的基础上，社会主义农业的产品量和商品率在增长着，举例说，从一九二六—二七年到一九五二—五三年，农业的商品产品，在谷物方面，从一千零三十万吨增加到四千零四十万吨，马铃薯方面，从三百万吨增加到一千二百五十万吨，肉类（以未经屠宰的牲畜重量计算），从二百四十万吨增加到五百万吨。
    但是苏联人民并不停留在已经达到的成就上。党中央在九月全会上通过了关于进一步发展农业的措施的详细决议，关怀增加居民们用的农业产品以及轻工业食品工业所用的农业原料的生产。
    劳动人民物质福利和文化
      水平的提高
    由于党和政府经常的关心，苏联劳动人民的福利和他们的文化水平不断地在提高着。工人和职员的实际收入在战后期间大大增加了。一九五二年每一个工作者的收入，比一九四○年提高了百分之六十八，比较革命前的俄国则提高了好多倍。一九五三年，工人、职员的实际工资和集体农庄庄员的收入有进一步的提高。
    在第五个五年计划期间，工人、职员的实际工资将再提高百分之三十五，而集体农庄庄员的收入则提高百分之四十。
    已经提出了任务要大大增加住宅建筑，学校、幼儿园、托儿所、医院建筑。一九五三年度国民经济计划所规定用在这些方面的拨款比去年多百分之三十到五十。
    满足居民的日益增长的物质和文化需要，就是共产党和苏维埃政府最重要的任务。
    国际形势和苏联的对外政策
    苏联人民从事着和平的创造性的劳动，同时认为为保卫和平，为发展和其他各国人民的经济、文化联系，为扩大和平进步民主阵营而进行积极斗争，就是自己的神圣责任。苏联对外政策的一贯爱好和平的性质是由新的社会主义社会制度的本质产生的。
    十月革命在我们国家里永远消灭了剥削阶级，也就消灭了他们所代表的势力，这种势力为了自己发财致富而发动国与国之间的强盗式战争。争取和平和事务上的合作、争取各国人民安全的斗争乃是苏联对外政策的总路线。
    由于千百万劳动大众积极参加了争取和平反对战争贩子的斗争，由于苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的巨大成就，使国际紧张局势得到了若干缓和。
    朝鲜的胜利是一件极为重大的事情，它证明着民主阵营的力量日益壮大和日益巩固。英勇的朝鲜人民军和勇敢的中国人民志愿军战胜了被夸耀吹嘘的而且全副武装的美国军队。由于自己军事失败、由于广大的舆论起来反对侵略者，美国帝国主义才被迫在朝鲜停战并进一步进行关于召开政治会议的谈判。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军以自己的坚忍和英勇赢得了全世界进步人类的赞扬。进步人类从朝鲜的例子中，再一次确信，当人民保卫自己的自由独立和自己的正义事业的时候，他们是不可战胜的。
    亚洲、非洲、南美洲各殖民地和附属国的劳动人民争取由帝国主义压迫下解放，争取提高生活水平的斗争底规模，正在日益扩大。
    但是我们不能忽略一种情况，就是帝国主义侵略势力企图用任何代价来破坏以和平方法解决争端的政策。那些侵略集团以美国垄断组织为首，顽强地保持国际紧张局势，因为他们害怕，如果事件顺着这条路线发展，那么他们就将不得不结束军备竞赛；而军备竞赛却是给他们带来巨大的利润，并造成工业中的人为的开工率增加的现象。美国统治集团追逐着最大限度利润并且争夺世界霸权，阻碍争端的和平解决，他们疯狂地准备新战争，在民主阵营各国的周围建立美国军事基地，加紧在西德复活军国主义把它变作在欧洲的战争策源地，并且企图复活日本军国主义来充当亚洲的战争策源地。美国垄断资本家们打算利用这些国家的人民来攻击人民民主国家，攻击苏联和中华人民共和国。
    四年来，美国统治集团违反理智，极力想使全世界相信：伟大的拥有将近六万万人口的中国仿佛并不存在。但是，中国现在却是一个伟大的强国，是亚洲和太平洋区域和平与进步的有力的因素。
    侵略者不愿意承认亚洲所发生了的巨大变化，然而，十分明显：亚洲已经不再是第二次世界大战前的那个亚洲了，那时帝国主义的强盗，是为所欲为地掠夺和压迫殖民地和半殖民地国家。遭受恐怖的压迫和奴役作为命运的旧的亚洲，现在已然变成过去了。伟大的十月革命的思想鼓舞了殖民地和附属国的人民为争取自由和自己国家的民族独立而进行斗争。帝国主义者可以为所欲为地掠夺人民的时代已永远结束了。现在帝国主义者要实现自己的侵略计划是更加困难了。
    毫无疑问，美帝国主义及其附庸国家统治世界的一切阴谋和狂妄的企图是注定要失败的，因为与侵略的垂死的资本主义世界和美国强盗们相对立着的是强大的进步的和平民主阵营。民主阵营的成就再一次证明：社会主义制度和人民民主制度与资本主义制度相比较，是具有无可争辩的巨大优越性的；资本主义制度注定要使劳动人民陷于贫困，失业和痛苦。民主阵营的人民坚定地走上了新生活的道路，并且永远也不再会离开这条道路。
    资本主义和殖民地国家的劳动人民不甘愿过那种自己毫无权利的贫困的命定死亡的生活。他们加强着反对美国垄断资本家和战争贩子们的斗争，做出了正确的结论，那就是必须用全力来巩固世界和平、进步和民主阵营。
    几万万人民为了保卫和平而进行的忘我的斗争，毫无疑问，必将获得最后胜利，和平事业必将最终获得胜利。
    苏中两国友谊进一步的巩固
    苏联在自己的对内和对外政策方面得到了所有爱好和平的民主国家的全力支持和合作，获得了全世界进步人类在道义上的支持。必须指出：中华人民共和国和苏联两国之间的真诚友谊是有着巨大意义。伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了苏中两国之间真诚的兄弟般关系的纪元。苏中两国人民之间牢不可破的永恒的友谊是对于和平事业和保证远东和全世界各族人民安全事业的巨大贡献。在过去的一年里，我们两国人民之间的友谊更加巩固了，增进了，而且正在继续不断地发展着。经济和文化联系加强了，我们两国之间进行着系统的经验交流。一九五三年苏联和中华人民共和国签订了关于苏联对中华人民共和国在实行五年计划方面给予技术援助的协定，这在进一步巩固和发展经济和文化联系上起着重大的作用。
    请容许我向中国朋友们表示感谢，感谢你们对于在中华人民共和国各企业和机关中服务的苏联专家们的工作给予了极高的评价。苏联专家在工作中所获得的成就，首先是由于苏维埃人在中华人民共和国受到的异常的关切和关怀。中国朋友们为苏联专家们创造了一切必需的条件，以便进行有成效的工作。这就使得我们的专家们有责任今后更好地工作，更完满地将自己的知识和经验交流给中国朋友们。毫无疑问，苏联专家必将采取一切办法来忠诚地完成他们所负担的责任。
    中苏友好协会在扩大苏中两国文化交流上进行着巨大的工作，因此，请允许我向它表示深深的感谢。中苏友协在向中国人民介绍苏联人民在经济和文化成就方面作了很多工作，在向苏联人民介绍中国人民所获得的成就上也作了不少工作。
    苏联人民对于在中华人民共和国里所进行的一切，表示着很大的关心，并且对于中国人民所获得的成就而感到衷心的欢欣。马林科夫同志在祝贺中华人民共和国成立四周年的贺电里表达了苏联人民对于中国人民的真诚友谊的情感。马林科夫同志提到：
    “中华人民共和国在各方面的进步使全体进步人类感到深为满意并引为骄傲，世界上没有任何一种力量能够阻止中国人民沿着全国高涨和祖国繁荣的道路前进。”
    苏联人民给自己提出任务——为了我们两国人民的利益，为了全人类的利益，更加广泛地开展和中国人民的经济、文化联系，更加巩固和中国人民的牢不可破的永恒的友谊。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年万岁！
    伟大的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    苏、中两国之间的牢不可破的永恒的兄弟般的友谊万岁！　（新华社）
