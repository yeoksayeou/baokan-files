    Confession of Second Lieutenant Charles M. McCell, 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, U.S. Air Force

    I am Charles M. McCell, Second Lieutenant in the Air Force, service number AO-2222551, twenty-four years old this year, residing at 983 West Ohio Street, Lima, Ohio. I am a U.S. Air Force F-86 pilot. I arrived in Korea on April 22, 1952, and was immediately assigned to the 334th Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group stationed at Kimpo.

    My first bacteriological warfare mission was to cross the Yalu River and enter China. On May 9, 1952, we dropped bacteriological bombs southeast of Shenyang.

    My squadron of four F-86 aircraft took off from Kimpo Air Base at 11:20 AM, assembled into a tight formation, ascended to an altitude of 40,000 feet, then maintained level flight in combat formation.

    Each aircraft carried one bacteriological bomb and one external fuel tank. We were briefed to bomb the industrial areas west of Benxi Lake and Tangjia Zhuangzi, both located on the river about thirty-five miles southeast of Shenyang.

    We flew east of Haeju and west of Pyongyang, crossed the Yalu River, and continued into China to our target area.

    During the flight, my main concern was whether we would encounter MiG aircraft, because I had seen four MiGs on the previous mission. I was worried about being shot down in China because I thought they would treat me as a spy rather than a prisoner of war.

    As we continued to fly north, I became very impatient with the squadron leader. I wondered why he wasn't giving the bombing signal so we could be sure of having enough fuel to fly back to Kimpo. The sooner we dropped the bombs, the sooner we could get back to safe territory.

    When he finally gave the bombing signal, I was relieved, pressed the bombing button, and wondered what kind of damage this bomb would cause in the area. As we turned to fly back, I was still afraid we would encounter MiGs before we reached the safer area south of the Chongchon River. Then we saw Kimpo, and I was completely relieved when I safely returned from my first bacteriological warfare mission. I briefly felt a bit guilty about what I had done, but I eventually convinced myself that I was just following orders.

    I had been mentally prepared for bacteriological warfare even before I arrived in Korea. When I was still at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, I and eighteen other F-86 pilots took a class on bacteriological warfare on March 20, 1952. The class was taught by Major James McInteer, the training squadron commander. He began by discussing the historical background of bacteriological warfare. He said that bacteriological weapons had not been used on a large scale until the Korean War. During World War II, the Japanese used bacteriological warfare against the Chinese on a relatively small scale. After the war, the U.S. government had its scientists accelerate this bacteriological warfare research that had begun during the war. With the help of foreign scientists, they had developed it to an unprecedented level. When our government realized that it could not win the war in Korea with our existing armed forces alone, it decided to use bacteriological weapons. He said that bacteriological weapons would initially be used on a small scale, but would increase over time.

    He said that the main objective was to try to end the war quickly, as with the atomic bomb attacks on Japan in the last war. Bacteriological warfare should cause infectious diseases, thus causing a shortage of frontline troops and manpower in the rear. It should demoralize the people to the point of giving up fighting. He said that bacteriological warfare was being used to retaliate against the Chinese because they had intervened in the war when we were almost victorious.

    He said that while artillery was also firing bacteriological shells mixed with regular explosive shells, bacteriological warfare would be carried out mostly by the Air Force. Therefore, he told us that even though the main task of you F-86 pilots is to fight MiG aircraft and provide cover for fighter-bombers, you will have to participate in bacteriological warfare during your tour of duty in Korea.

    Secondly, he explained the types of bacteria and bacteriological bombs dropped by F-86 aircraft. He said that because most of the F-86 aircraft's bombing was to be carried out from high altitude, the Air Force had developed a special high-altitude bacteriological bomb.

    In conclusion, the major said that all of this information was classified as "Top Secret" and that we were not to talk about it to anyone, not even among ourselves.

    I arrived in Kimpo near Seoul, Korea on April 22, 1952. During the four-day ground course for new pilots, we took a lecture on bacteriological warfare given by Lieutenant Richard Lidland, the group intelligence officer. He said that bacteriological bombs were initially dropped by bombers, and although F-86 aircraft had done some experimental bacteriological bomb drops as early as late December 1951, they only really began participating in March 1952. He added that F-86 aircraft would be used even more in the future.

    He said that we F-86 pilots were not only to drop bacteriological bombs in North Korea, but also in Northeast China; due to the fuel situation, we needed to drop bacteriological bombs from high altitude.

    He said that if we were attacked by MiG aircraft on the way to our target, we should immediately drop the bacteriological bombs and try to fly away without engaging, because we didn't have enough fuel.

    At the end of the lecture, he warned us that this information was classified as "Top Secret" and was not to be discussed arbitrarily.

    So when I attended the group briefing on May 9, 1952—the day of my first mission to China—it did not surprise us that the group executive officer told us to take an external fuel tank and a bacteriological bomb to Northeast China. The bombing signal would be given by each squadron leader, and the target area was the industrial area west of Benxi Lake and Tangjia Zhuangzi, about thirty-five miles southeast of Shenyang. He said that although this mission was being carried out north of the Yalu River, we were to say in our debriefing that the mission had been carried out south of the Yalu River as stipulated, even though we had dropped bacteriological bombs in China. He explained that this was for the sake of record keeping, because we were not really at war with China yet.

    When we heard in the group briefing that we were going to drop bacteriological bombs north of the Yalu River in Chinese territory, I initially had a selfish thought. I thought, why do we have to go bombing? We are supposed to be fighter pilots, and we are only taking one external fuel tank to fly such a long distance. Why doesn't the Air Force use bombers to do the bombing? But my sense of discipline told me that I should carry out the order like the rest of the pilots, so I let it go.

    As mentioned earlier, we flew to Tangjia Zhuangzi and dropped the bacteriological bombs when the squadron leader gave the order, and then returned.

    After landing, everyone went to debrief. During the debriefing, the squadron leader said to Lieutenant Lidland, the group intelligence officer, "We carried out the mission as instructed." The squadron leader then indicated our approximate route on the map and reported the altitude and airspeed at which the bacteriological bombs were dropped. We confirmed his statement and then left.

    On May 18, 1952, the target of my second bacteriological warfare mission was also in the same area of Northeast China, south of Tangjia Zhuangzi, about thirty-five miles southeast of Shenyang. Each aircraft carried one external fuel tank and one bacteriological bomb. Since the visibility was somewhat better than before, we were able to make out the outline of the city of Shenyang. Because of the distance, we couldn't see any significant features other than that it was a large industrial city bordering a river to the south. As far as I could tell, our bacteriological bombs should have hit just south of Tangjia Zhuangzi on the second mission. But we couldn't say for sure where the bacteriological bombs landed on the first mission because the visibility was too poor at the time.

    During the debriefing, the squadron leader said that the bacteriological bombs had been dropped in the designated area.

    My fourteenth combat mission on May 20, 1952, was my third bacteriological warfare mission. The target was the area around Tieshan City at the tip of the Langdong (transliteration) Peninsula. Each aircraft again carried one external fuel tank and one bacteriological bomb. Because we didn't have to worry about fuel particularly on this mission, each squadron leader could choose their precise bombing point and the direction from which they wanted to approach the target area. The flight leader who briefed us said that each squadron could make at least two patrol flights along the Yalu River after dropping the bombs before returning to Kimpo. We dropped the bacteriological bombs fifteen miles southeast of Tieshan, continued along the coast to Sinuiju, turned around, and made three patrol flights along the Yalu River before returning to base.

    The next day, May 21, I was shot down by a MiG, so I no longer needed to participate in bacteriological warfare missions.

    To my knowledge, all U.S. Air Force combat units have carried out bacteriological warfare missions. Such as the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing (F-86 type) in Suwon, the F-80 aircraft group in Suwon, and the F-51 aircraft group in Wonju.

    Most pilots hated missions across the Yalu River. It is very bad to participate in bacteriological warfare to attack a country that you are not even at war with. Even from the pilot's point of view, it is a bad mission.

    As a result, morale among the pilots in Kimpo was not very high. They were willing to fly as many sorties as possible in a day so that they could end their tour of duty and return to the United States.

    美国空军第四战斗截击机联队第四战斗截击机大队第三三四战斗截击机中队少尉查理士·麦·克尔的供词
    我是查理士·麦·克尔，空军少尉，军号AO—2222551，今年二十四岁，家住俄亥俄州利马城西俄亥俄街九八三号。我是一个美国空军F—86型飞机驾驶员，一九五二年四月二十二日来到朝鲜，当即被派到驻在金浦的第四战斗截击机大队第三三四中队。
    我的第一次细菌战任务是越过鸭绿江，进入中国。在一九五二年五月九日那天，我们在沈阳东南投了细菌弹。
    我的小队四架F—86型飞机，于十一时二十分从金浦空军基地起飞，集结成密集队形，上升至四万英尺高空，然后维持水平飞行，并排成战斗队形。
    每架飞机都带着一枚细菌弹和一个机外副油箱。我们受简令轰炸位于沈阳东南约三十五英里的河上的本溪湖和唐家庄子两地西面的工业区。
    我们经过海州之东和平壤西郊，越过鸭绿江，继续飞入中国，到我们的目标地区。
    当飞行时，我主要担心着是否会遇到米格飞机，因为就在前一次任务中，我曾见过四架米格。我担心在中国被击落，因为我想这样会把我当作间谍而不是战俘。
    当我们继续向北飞行时，我对小队长变得很不耐烦了。我想他为什么不发出投弹信号，以使我们有把握保留足够的燃料飞回金浦。我们把炸弹丢得愈快，就能愈快地回到安全的领土上。
    当他终于发出投弹的信号时，我才松了一口气，按下投弹电钮，同时我也在猜想，这种炸弹究竟会在该地造成怎样的损害。当我们转弯飞回来的时候，在飞到清川江之南比较安全的地区之前，我仍然害怕我们会遇到米格。随后我们看到了金浦，当我从第一次细菌战任务安全返回的时候，这才完全放下心来。我对我已做过的事情曾一度有一点罪恶的感觉，但是我终于说服了自己，我只是按照命令执行我的任务而已。
    早在我来到朝鲜以前，我对细菌战已有了思想准备。当我还在美国内华达州的内利斯空军基地时，与我同在一起的十八名F—86型飞机驾驶员，于一九五二年三月二十日上了一堂关于细菌战的课。该课由训练中队中队长詹姆斯·麦克英特少校担任。他上课时首先讲授细菌战的历史背景。他说，直到朝鲜战争以前，细菌武器尚未大规模使用。在第二次大战中，日本人曾以比较小的规模对中国人进行细菌战。战后，美国政府使本国科学家加紧这种在战争期间已开始了的细菌战研究。借外国科学家的帮助，他们已将它发展到前所未有的最高度。当我国政府认识到仅以我们已有的武装部队不能在朝鲜赢得战争时，便决定使用细菌武器。他说，细菌武器开始将小规模试用，但以后将与时俱增。
    他说，主要目的是试图要像在上次大战中用原子弹袭击日本那样很快地结束这次战争。进行细菌战应该会引起传染病，因而会造成前线部队和后方人力的缺乏。它应该会使人民的士气低落到放弃作战的地步。他说，细菌战是被用来对中国人报复的，因为他们在我们几乎获得胜利时，干涉了这次战争。
    他说，虽然炮兵也发射着与正规爆炸弹混合在一起的细菌炮弹，但细菌战绝大部分要由空军来执行。所以，他对我们说，即使你们F—86型飞机驾驶员的主要任务是与米格机作战和掩护战斗轰炸机，但当你们在朝鲜值勤期间，将必须参加细菌战。
    其次，他说明F—86型飞机所投的细菌和细菌弹的种类。他说，由于F—86型飞机的绝大部分的投掷要从高空进行，空军已发展有一种由高空投掷的特别的细菌弹。
    少校在结束语中说，所有这些资料被列为“绝密”，我们不得对任何人谈论，甚至在我们内部也不能谈论。
    我于一九五二年四月二十二日到达朝鲜汉城附近的金浦。在为新来的驾驶员所设的四天地面课程中，我们上了一堂由大队情报官理查德·利得兰中尉讲授的细菌战讲课。他说，细菌弹是由轰炸机开始投掷的，虽然F—86型飞机已早在一九五一年十二月下旬作了一些试验性的细菌弹投掷，但它们在一九五二年三月才开始真正参加。他补充说，F—86型飞机在将来甚至要更多地被使用。
    他说，我们F—86型飞机驾驶员不仅要在北朝鲜投细菌弹，而且要在中国东北投细菌弹；由于燃料的情况，我们需要从高空投掷细菌弹。
    他说一旦在我们飞向目标的途中遭遇米格机攻击时，我们要立即投下细菌弹，并设法飞开，不要交战，因为燃料不够。
    讲课结束时，他警告我们这些资料被列为“绝密”，不得任意谈论。
    所以当我在一九五二年五月九日——我第一次到中国去的任务这一天——参加大队简令时，大队执行官告诉我们要带一只机外副油箱和一枚细菌弹到中国东北去的事，并不使我们感到惊讶。投弹信号将由各小队长发出，目标区是沈阳东南本溪湖和唐家庄子二地西面之工业区。他说，虽然这次任务是在鸭绿江之北执行，但我们在汇报时要说该任务已按规定在鸭绿江之南执行，虽然我们已在中国投下了细菌弹。他解释说，这是为了存档，因为我们还没有真正与中国作战。
    当我们在大队简令中听到要在鸭绿江以北中国境内投掷细菌弹时，开始我有一种自私的感想。我想，为什么我们要去轰炸呢？我们被认为是战斗机驾驶员，而且只带一只机外副油箱要去飞行这样远的航程。为什么空军不用轰炸机去进行轰炸呢？但我的纪律感告诉我，应该像其余的驾驶员那样去执行命令，所以我也就算了。
    如前所述，我们飞到了唐家庄子，并在小队长发出命令时投下了细菌弹，随即返航。
    着陆后，大家都去汇报。汇报时，小队长对大队情报官利得兰中尉说：“我们按指令执行了任务。”小队长随即在地图上指示我们大概的航线，并报告了投掷细菌弹的高度与空速。我们肯定了他的陈述后，然后离去。
    一九五二年五月十八日，我执行的第二次细菌战任务的目标，也在中国东北的同一地区，沈阳东南约三十五英里唐家庄子城之南。每架飞机携带了一只机外副油箱和一枚细菌弹。由于能见度比过去好些，我们能够看出沈阳城市的轮廓。因为距离很远，除了看出它是南边临河的一座大工业城市外，不能看出什么显著的特征。尽我能够判别的，在第二次任务中，我们的细菌弹应该已投中唐家庄子正南。但我们不能确切地说，在第一次任务中细菌弹投在什么地方，因为当时能见度太差。
    在汇报时，小队长说细菌弹已被丢在指定地区。
    我在一九五二年五月二十日执行的第十四次战斗任务，是我的第三次细菌战任务。目标是位于郎洞（译音）半岛顶端的铁山城周围地区。每架飞机又携带了一只机外副油箱和一枚细菌弹。因为在这次任务中不用特别担心燃料，所以可由各小队长选择其精确的投弹点，和他们希望接近目标区的方向。对我们作简令的编队领队说，每小队在投弹后，回到金浦前，至少能沿鸭绿江作两次巡逻飞行。我们在铁山东南十五英里处投下了细菌弹后，继续沿海岸飞至新义州，转了弯，并在返回基地前沿鸭绿江作了三次巡逻飞行。
    次日，即五月二十一日，我被米格机击落，这样我不再需要参加细菌战任务了。
    据我所知，所有美国空军作战单位都执行过细菌战任务。如在水原的第五十一战斗截击机联队
  （F—86型），在水原的F—80型飞机大队，在原州的F—51型飞机大队。
    绝大部分驾驶员都憎恶越过鸭绿江的任务。参加细菌战以攻击一个甚至你未与其交战的国家是十分糟糕的。即使从驾驶员的观点来看，它也是一种不好的任务。
    结果，在金浦驾驶员们的士气是不很高的。他们都愿意在一天中尽可能地多执行几次飞行任务，以便能结束役期而回美国去。
