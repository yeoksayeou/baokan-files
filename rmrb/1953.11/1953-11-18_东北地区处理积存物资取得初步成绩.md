Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, first-level organs in the Northeast region and various provinces and cities have successively launched work to process latent materials. From the time the Northeast Latent Materials Processing Committee was established until late October, incomplete statistics show that latent materials worth over 350 billion yuan have been processed. Seven units, including the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau, the Northeast Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Northeast Office of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Northeast Branch of the State Materials Reserve Bureau, have processed latent materials worth over 250 billion yuan. The latent material processing work of other state-owned and local state-owned enterprises has also been launched. During this period, about 70 percent of the latent materials processed were important means of production such as steel and non-ferrous metals, and some were consumer goods currently needed for market supply. The quantity of latent materials yet to be processed is still very large. During this period, the Northeast region actively processed latent materials and adjusted surpluses and shortages, which not only saved funds but also solved the current difficulties in the supply of certain materials. For example, the Changchun City Construction Bureau planned to extend the tram line to a factory construction site, but lacked steel rails. The city finance bureau collected more than 200 tons of steel rails from various locations in the suburbs, ensuring the construction of the line. Another example is that the Shenyang Electrical and Mechanical Supply Station was about to run out of bare copper wire and was struggling to find a source of supply, but hundreds of tons were stockpiled in units such as the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, the Electric Power Bureau, and the Coal Mine Bureau. After processing, the supply was guaranteed. The processing of latent materials has played a role in promoting the improvement of materials supply management. For example, when the Fushun and Fuxin Mining Bureaus checked and appraised inventory materials, the Fushun Mining Bureau reduced its steel purchase plan by more than 2,000 tons compared to the beginning of the year based on item-by-item verification against the materials plan. The Fuxin Mining Bureau reduced its purchase of electric wires by more than 10,000 meters. This not only rationally utilized inventory materials and accelerated capital turnover but also prevented the generation of new stockpiles.

Although the processing of latent materials in the Northeast region has achieved certain results and created some experience, there are still some problems in the processing work that urgently need to be improved: First, the progress of the work is extremely uneven. Some units only made general arrangements and mobilizations and lacked specific organizational and guarantee measures, so the work progressed slowly and the effect was not great. There are also individual units that have not yet taken active action, believing that "there is no latent material." Some departments not only do not understand the situation of their subordinate units, but also have not actively sought ways to process a large amount of materials stockpiled in their own department's warehouses. It should be particularly noted that in some units, there is a passive mentality of waiting for and relying on higher authorities to process the materials or hoping to push them all to the trade departments. Second, some units do not have a clear picture of latent materials and are not serious about the processing work. In particular, some units process materials that their departments must or should reserve. After a transaction with other departments, they realize that they need the materials and request the cancellation of the contract, which affects the work. Third, there is a lack of an overall perspective. For example, some purchasing units believe that the stockpiling departments are eager to process materials, so they deliberately suppress prices in an attempt to take the opportunity to obtain huge profits. Some stockpiling units only care about completing the task and attempt to push out materials of both good and bad quality together. Some purchasing units do not seriously fulfill the contract and delay picking up the goods. It is particularly noteworthy that some units in the processing work one-sidedly emphasize "fast processing and selling for more money." Therefore, in the processing process, they do not distinguish between varieties or choose objects, violating the processing principles and arbitrarily selling to private merchants, allowing illegal private merchants to take the opportunity to speculate and seek high profits, causing losses to the country. For example, the Shenyang Office of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry sold seven air pressure testers along with scrap iron by the kilogram for 770,000 yuan. The private merchants resold them for 12.05 million yuan.

In order to conscientiously implement the policy of investing the country's valuable materials into production and construction, accelerating capital turnover, and ensuring the over-fulfillment of the national plan, all relevant units should overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, actively organize forces, and, in conjunction with the preparation of the 1954 materials supply plan and the reserve of materials for production and capital construction in 1954, deeply carry out the processing of latent materials.

    东北地区处理积存物资取得初步成绩
    增产节约运动开展以来，东北一级机关及各省市相继展开了处理潜在物资的工作。东北潜在物资处理委员会成立后到十月下旬，据不完全统计已处理三千五百余亿元的潜在物资，东北煤矿管理局、第二机械工业部驻东北办事处、重工业部驻东北办事处及国家物资储备局东北分局等七个单位已处理的潜在物资价值两千五百多亿元，其他国营及地方国营企业的潜在物资处理工作也均已展开。这一时期所处理的潜在物资约有百分之七十以上为钢铁、有色金属等重要的生产资料，也有一部分是目前需要供应市场的消费资料。尚待处理的潜在物资数量仍是很大。这一时期东北地区积极处理潜在物资，调剂有无，不仅节省了资金，而且解决了目前某些物资供应不足的困难。如长春市建设局拟将电车线路延至某工厂工地，但无钢轨，经市财政局由市郊各处搜集了二百余吨钢轨，保证了线路的修建；又如沈阳交电供应站的裸铜线即将脱销，苦于无处进货，但在邮电局、电业局和煤矿局等单位却积压了数百吨，经处理后保证了供应。在处理潜在物资中对改进材料的供应管理工作起了推动作用。如抚顺与阜新矿务局在盘查、鉴定库存物资时，按照材料计划逐项核对的结果，抚顺矿务局仅钢铁一项就较年初供应计划削减了两千多吨。阜新矿务局减少购买电线一万多公尺。这不仅是合理利用了库存物资，加速了资金周转，还可防止新的积压的产生。
    东北潜在物资的处理工作，虽获得了一定成绩，创造了一些经验，但在处理工作中，仍存在着一些问题，急待改进：一、工作进行情况极不平衡。有些单位只作了一般的布置动员，缺乏具体组织和保证措施，因而工作进展迟缓，效果不大；还有个别单位，至今尚未积极行动，认为“无啥潜在物资”；有的部门不但对所属单位情况不甚了解，连本部门仓库积压的大量物资，也未积极设法处理。应引起特别注意的，是在某些单位中，存有等待、依赖上级处理或希望全部推给贸易部门的消极思想。二、有的单位对潜在物资心中无数，处理工作不认真，特别是有的单位把自己部门必须或应储备的物资也对外处理，经与其他部门成交后，才发现自己需要，要求废除合同，影响了工作。三、缺乏整体观点。如有的购货单位，认为积压部门处理迫切，故意压等压价，企图乘机获取厚利；有的积压单位只顾完成任务，企图把质量好坏的物资一起推出；有的购货单位则不认真履行合同，迟不提货；特别值得注意的是有些单位在处理工作中，片面的强调 “处理快，多卖钱”，因而在处理中不分品种，不择对象，违反处理原则随便售与私商，使不法私商乘隙投机倒把，谋取高利，给国家造成损失。如重工业部建筑工程公司沈阳办事处将七个气压试验器随同废铁按斤卖了七十七万元，私商转手即卖了一千二百零五万元。
    为认真贯彻将国家宝贵的物资投入生产建设事业，加速资金周转，保证超额完成国家计划的方针，各有关单位应克服上述缺点，积极组织力量，结合编制一九五四年材料供应计划及为一九五四年生产与基本建设储备材料，深入地开展潜在物资的处理工作。（东北潜在物资处理委员会办公室）
