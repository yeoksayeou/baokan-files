Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. The situation of 274 state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in East China in completing state plans has shown significant progress. Many factories and mines have completed their annual output value plan or profit delivery plan ahead of schedule. Those who completed their annual output value plan by the end of September included the Asia Steel Plant, Shandong Emery Wheel Factory, Dacheng Motor Factory, Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory, Yimin Food Company Plant No. 1 and Plant No. 3, and others. Those who completed their annual profit delivery plan included Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Steel Company Plant No. 1, Plant No. 3, Xinhua Steel Plant, Asia Steel Plant, Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, Shanghai Chemical Plant, Yimin Food Company Plant No. 3, Nanyang Tobacco Company, China Photoengraving Company, and others. The factories under the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government had completed 75.7 percent of their annual profit delivery plan by the end of August, and the factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company had completed 94.4 percent of their annual profit delivery plan by the end of August, and it is expected that they can complete 147 percent by the end of the year.

	In the third quarter, the total output value of the 274 factories and mines in the region completed 103.95 percent of the plan. Among the 28 major products, 23 exceeded the plan. The quality of the products has also improved compared with the first and second quarters. For example, the qualified rate of ribbed steel produced by the Xinhua Steel Plant was originally planned to be 99 percent, but has actually reached 99.6 percent. The yarn breakage rate of 20-count yarn in the state-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Mill was 209 breaks per thousand spindles per hour in the second quarter, but decreased to 144 breaks in the third quarter. The execution of cost plans has also improved. For example, the actual total cost of Shanghai Steel Company Plant No. 1 in August was 23.35 percent lower than the plan.

	In the third quarter, new products and new operating methods of great significance to the national economy continued to emerge. Such as the 100-ton giant overhead crane of the Shanghai Boiler Factory, the Soviet-style gantry planer of the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, and the one-time rail rolling method of the Shanghai Steel Company Plant No. 3, etc. At present, the Shanghai Bulb Factory is experimenting with the production of tungsten wire and alloys such as copper-tungsten, silver-tungsten, and tungsten carbide.

    华东区工矿企业生产情况有进步
    许多厂矿已完成全年产值或上缴利润计划
  【新华社上海三十日电】华东全区二百七十四个国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿，完成国家计划的情况已有显著进步。不少厂矿已提前完成了全年产值计划或上缴利润计划。到九月底就完成全年产值计划的有亚细亚钢铁厂、山东金刚砂厂、大成电机厂、南京制药厂、益民食品公司一厂、三厂等。完成全年上缴利润计划的有上海电力公司、上海钢铁公司第一厂、第三厂、新沪钢铁厂、亚细亚钢铁厂、上海矿山机械厂、上海汽轮机厂、上海化工厂、益民食品公司三厂、南洋烟草公司、中国制版公司等。中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东办事处所属各厂，到八月底统计已完成全年上缴利润计划百分之七十五点七，华东钢铁公司所属各厂到八月底也完成了全年上缴利润计划百分之九十四点四，预计到年底可以完成百分之一百四十七。
    在第三季度里，全区二百七十四个厂矿的总产值，完成了计划的百分之一百零三点九五。二十八种主要产品中，有二十三种超额完成计划。产品的质量，也比第一、二季度提高。如新沪钢铁厂所产竹节钢的合格率，原计划是百分之九十九，实际已达到了百分之九十九点六。国营上海第六棉纺织厂二十支纱断头率，第二季度是每一千个锭子每小时断二百零九根，第三季度就减少到一百四十四根。执行成本计划情况也有改进。如上海钢铁公司第一厂八月份的实际总成本，比计划降低了百分之二十三点三五。
    在第三季度还不断出现了对国民经济有重大意义的新产品和新的操作方法。如上海锅炉厂的一百吨巨型行车、济南第二机床厂的苏式龙门刨床、上海钢铁公司第三厂的钢轨一次轧成法等等。现在，上海灯泡厂正在试制钨丝和铜钨、银钨、炭化钨等合金。
