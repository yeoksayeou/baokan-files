    In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Restoration and Construction Underway at the Sup’ung Hydroelectric Power Plant
    The massive Sup’ung Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Yalu River, destroyed by American aerial bandits, has begun restoration work with the great assistance of the Soviet Union.
    Everywhere on the construction site are slogans like: "The great Soviet Union is the true helper of the Korean people!" and "Increase the speed of restoration and construction, and repay the assistance of the fraternal Soviet people with guaranteed safe power transmission!" On the wide road from the main gate to the mechanical workshop, workers are busy filling bomb craters. On the roof of the distribution department, the hands of welders working intently flash with the silver sparks of electric welding. Workers in the engineering and power department are moving the machinery that was evacuated during the war back to its original location and installing it; workers in the hydraulic equipment department are also battling the surging waves, repairing pumps and carrying out drainage work. The restoration of the power plant has entered a high tide.
    Under the leadership and assistance of the Labor Party branch, a production increase competition movement has been widely launched on the construction site. Employees of the Jiang Zhonggen workshop mechanized the labor process, saving more than 450 man-hours in a week. Female workers also exceeded their daily planned output by 180 percent. Young technician chief Li Youqing directly imparts advanced technology on-site, accelerating the process of technical personnel mastering advanced techniques. From the towering dam, the torrents pouring through twenty-six gates roar, as if singing the tense and joyful labor of the workers.
    Rebuilding the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works
  The restoration work of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works has only been underway for two or three months, but the factory already presents a new look. The Soviet government's declaration to help the Korean people rebuild this factory has further increased the labor enthusiasm of all employees.
    During the three years of war, the factory was bombed and shelled by the enemy almost every day, and important machines such as iron smelting furnaces, coke ovens, generators, and blowers were severely damaged. But the workers still bravely protected the machines and continued production.
    After the signing of the armistice agreement, the factory quickly formulated a restoration plan and began preparations. They plan to repair several machine tools, locomotives, freight cars, and in-plant railways within this year. At present, they have repaired equipment such as blowers and air blowers; the repair work of the iron smelting furnace and coke oven, the heart of the steel plant, has begun; and the waterworks workers have also started to repair the waterworks project that can supply 150,000 tons of water per day on average. The factory is also preparing to train 200 technical workers by the end of this year. The in-plant technical worker training center, which started in September, already has more than 400 workers studying. Skilled and excellent precision worker Zheng Dongzhu and lathe worker Li Qingxian guarantee to train more than ten technical workers by the end of this year.
    Workers are overcoming various difficulties to carry out restoration work. The reconstruction project of the oxygen plant encountered great difficulties due to the lack of asbestos. The workers in the refractory materials workshop tried to find refractory bricks scattered everywhere, so that the furnace construction work could be started quickly, and more than 30 percent of the entire project has been completed.
    Now, on the green sea in front of the steel plant, ships are shuttling back and forth carrying important equipment evacuated during the war, and trailers and trucks loaded with construction materials are constantly running on the transportation roads in the plant. The upsurge of the steel plant's restoration work is boiling everywhere.
    Building a Large-Scale Fertilizer Factory
    On July 30, the third day after the Korean armistice—a heartening message suddenly spread in the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory: "Marshal Kim Il-sung is here!" Indeed, on this day, Marshal Kim Il-sung personally inspected the fertilizer factory and congratulated the workers on their new achievements in the restoration work. The workers scrambled to swear to the leader: "We will fight to build a prosperous and strong motherland and to complete the national plan for the people's economy!" The leader also smiled and patted the workers on the shoulders, encouraging them to work harder.
    Hungnam is a famous industrial city in Korea. The huge fertilizer factory built here produced 400,000 tons of fertilizer and more than 140 kinds of chemicals every year before the outbreak of the Korean War. However, during the three years of war, American aerial bandits carried out more than 700 crazy bombings on Hungnam, and the fertilizer factory was severely damaged.
    After the Korean armistice, the workers who persisted in production in underground cities during the war immediately appeared on the ruins and started restoration work. Winches and cranes are constantly turning on the construction site, trucks loaded with mud are shuttling back and forth, and small trains and rail soil trucks on light railways are loaded with steel, bricks, gravel, and yellow sand to the construction site. Steel and concrete foundation work is being carried out everywhere.
    According to the plan, this factory will be built into the largest fertilizer factory. From November, a 4,500-horsepower converter will start working; from December, the tall chimney of the silicate factory will start to emit smoke, and the laughter of workers will rise in soap, battery, and oil factories. In two more years, snow-white fertilizer will pour out of the ammonium sulfate factory like a waterfall.
      The Birth of a Canal
    During the Korean War of Liberation, Taegam-ri was reduced to ruins by enemy planes overnight. This is one of the countless rural villages destroyed by the enemy.
    The Korean armistice was signed, and the rural areas of Korea, like cities and factories, immediately began to recover and build. The farmers in Taegam-ri also took action, and everyone agreed that they should first build a canal more than three kilometers long, so that they could use the canal to irrigate more than 20 hectares of newly reclaimed paddy fields next year.
    The project started on July 30. Men, women, old and young in the whole village turned out under the slogan of "Building the countryside depends on our own hands." They repaired waterways during the day and harvested crops at night. Soldiers of the Korean People's Army stationed nearby also came to help them build roads, and people from nearby cities also came to help them cut grass. In this way, the project, which was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of August, was completed six days ahead of schedule on August 25.
    The village immediately held a village meeting to summarize the early completion of this waterway construction project and discussed the plan to rebuild Taegam-ri. On the way home after the meeting, Park Ok-bo looked at the newly built waterway and said to Ko Young-bok:
    "Sister Young-bok! Let's think about this time next year! That low-lying area will become paddy fields, and we can harvest nearly 100 tons of rice just from there. Our lives will be better! Ah! That would be great..."
    "Ok-bo, that's for sure! Isn't that why we have been fighting until victory!" Ko Young-bok replied to Ok-bo with great pride.

    在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    水丰发电厂进行恢复建设
    被美国空中强盗破坏了的鸭绿江上巨大的水丰发电厂，在苏联的伟大援助下，开始了恢复工程。
    工地上到处贴着这样的口号：“伟大的苏联是朝鲜人民真正的援助者！”“提高恢复建设的速度，用保障安全送电来报答兄弟般的苏联人民的援助！”在从正门到机械场的宽阔道路上，工人们忙碌着填炸弹坑。在配电部的屋顶上，埋头工作的电焊工的手里，闪耀着电焊的银色的火花。工务动力部门的工人们，正在把在战争期间疏散的机器搬回原处，安装起来；水力设备部门的工人们，也正和汹涌的波浪搏斗，进行着补修唧筒和排水工作。发电厂的恢复工作已进入高潮。
    在劳动党支部的领导和帮助下，工地上广泛地展开了增产竞赛运动。姜钟根车间的员工们把劳动过程机械化，在一星期内节省了四百五十多个人工。女工们也超额完成了每天计划的百分之一百八十。青年技师长李有庆，在现场直接传授先进技术，加速了技术人员掌握先进技术的过程。从高耸的堤坝上，通过二十六个闸门倾泻下来的激流，哗哗作响，仿佛在歌唱着工人们紧张愉快的劳动。
    重建金策炼钢厂
  金策炼钢厂的修复工作开始只不过两三个月，工厂里已经呈现出一片新气象。苏联政府声明帮助朝鲜人民重建这个工厂的消息，更加提高了全体职工的劳动热情。
    在三年的战争中，这个工厂几乎没有一天不受到敌人的轰炸和炮击，重要机器如炼铁炉、解炭炉、发电机、鼓风炉等都遭到严重的破坏。可是工人们仍然英勇地保护机器，继续生产。
    停战协定签字后，工厂很快地制订了修复计划，开始进行准备工作。他们准备在今年内修复若干工作机、机车、货车和厂内铁路。目前他们已经修好了鼓风炉和送风机等设备；炼钢厂的心脏——炼铁炉和解炭炉的修复工程已开始进行；自来水工人们也已着手进行修复平均每天能供给十五万吨水量的自来水工程。工厂并且准备今年年底培养出二百名技术工人。今年九月开始的厂内技术工人养成所，已有四百多名工人在学习。技术优良的精细工郑东洙和车床工李庆善，保证在今年年底以前培养出十名以上的技术工人。
    工人们克服种种困难进行修复工作。氧气工厂的重建工程，由于石棉缺乏而碰到很大的困难，耐火物车间的工人们，就设法找回散在各处的耐火砖，使筑炉工作能够迅速开始，目前已完成了全部工程的百分之三十以上。
    现在，炼钢厂前面的碧绿的海面上，船舶正往来如梭地运回战时疏散的重要器材，满载建筑器材的拖车和卡车在厂内的运输路上不断地奔驰。炼钢厂的恢复工作的热潮到处沸腾着。
    兴建大规模的肥料工厂
    朝鲜停战后的第三天——七月三十日，在兴南肥料工厂里忽然传开了一个振奋人心的消息：“金日成元帅来了！”果真，这一天金日成元帅亲自视察了这个肥料工厂，祝贺工人们在修复工作中的新成就。工人们争先恐后地向领袖宣誓：“要为建设富强的祖国，为完成人民经济的国家计划而奋斗！”领袖也微笑着拍着工人们的肩膀，勉励他们加倍努力。
    兴南是朝鲜著名的工业城市，建设在这里的巨大的肥料工厂，在朝鲜战争爆发前，每年出产四十万吨肥料和一百四十多种化学品。可是，三年多的战争中，美国空中强盗对兴南进行了七百次以上的疯狂轰炸，肥料工厂受到严重的破坏。
    朝鲜停战以后，那些在战争中转入地下城市坚持生产的工人们，立刻出现在废墟上，开始了修复工作。工地上不断转动着卷扬机和起重机，满载泥土的卡车来往如梭，轻便铁道上的小列车和有轨土车满载着钢骨、砖头、碎石和黄沙开向工地。到处进行着钢骨水泥的打地基的工程。
    根据计划，这个工厂将被建成为最大的肥料工厂。从十一月起，有四千五百匹马力的变流器，就要开始工作；从十二月起，硅酸工厂的高大烟筒将开始吐烟，肥皂、电池、制油等工厂里将哄起工人们的欢笑声。再过两年，雪白的肥料也将像瀑布一样从硫铵工厂里倾泻出来。
      一条水渠的诞生
    在朝鲜解放战争期间，泽岩里曾在一夜之间被敌人的飞机炸成了废墟。这是被敌人破坏的千千万万农村中的一个。
    朝鲜停战了，朝鲜的农村也像城市和工厂一样马上开始了恢复和建设。泽岩里的农民也行动起来了，大家一致认为首先要修筑一条三公里多长的水渠，明年就可以利用这条水渠灌溉二十多公顷新开垦的水田。
    工程从七月三十日动工。全村男女老少在“建设农村要靠我们的双手”的口号下一齐出动。他们白天修水路，夜晚还要去收割庄稼。驻在附近的朝鲜人民军战士们也来帮他们修路，附近城市里的人们也来帮他们割草。这样，原订在八月底完工的工程，就提前六天在八月二十五日完工了。
    村里立刻开了个里民大会，给这次修筑水路工程提前完工作了总结，并且讨论了重建泽岩里的计划。在散会后回家的路上，朴玉宝望着新修的水路，对高英福说：
    “英福姐！咱们想想明年这个时候吧！那一片洼地就要变成水田了，光是那里就可以多收将近一百吨的稻子呢。咱们的日子也就能过好啦！啊！那该多好……”
    “玉宝，那是一定的！我们不就是为着这，才一直战斗到胜利吗！”高英福非常自豪地回答着玉宝的话。
