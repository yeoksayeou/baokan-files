This warm and gracious sentiment embodies the deep friendship and solid unity between our two peoples. Let us cheer for this friendship and unity. Under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting shoulder to shoulder, the Korean people defeated American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. We firmly believe that in the future, under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the support of the world peace forces led by the Soviet Union, the Korean people will certainly achieve brilliant successes in the work of restoring peace and construction.

    General He Long raised his glass to the great achievements of the Korean people in the restoration and construction of the national economy, to the eternal consolidation of the militant friendship forged in blood between the peoples of Korea and China, to the health of the Korean people's beloved leader and the Chinese people's close friend, Marshal Kim Il-sung, to the health of the strong fortress of world peace, the great Soviet Union and the Soviet leaders headed by Comrade Malenkov, to the strength and unity of the world peace and democracy forces, and to the health of the leaders of all fraternal countries, to the health of all international friends present, to the health of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people, the defenders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army, and to the health of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong's good soldiers, the loyal comrades-in-arms of the Korean People's Army, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Marshal Kim Il-sung delivered a speech at the reception. He said: The united strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples has become even stronger in the common struggle against the American aggressors, and has achieved a great victory. I believe that this united strength will also become one of the main guarantees in the Korean people's efforts to restore the post-war economy and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Marshal Kim Il-sung then said: The Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has visited Korea many times, strengthening the militant friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, inspiring the fighting spirit of the Korean and Chinese people's troops in the war, and further strengthening the Korean people's confidence in victory. There is no doubt that the active activities of the representatives of this delegation will also greatly encourage the Korean people's post-war economic recovery and construction, and further consolidate the friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples. I express my deep gratitude for the warm support given to the Korean people by the great Chinese people.

    Marshal Kim Il-sung first proposed a toast to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

    During the reception, the guests repeatedly toasted to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Kim Il-sung, the Soviet leaders headed by Chairman Malenkov, the leaders of all people's democratic countries, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the health of all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army.
