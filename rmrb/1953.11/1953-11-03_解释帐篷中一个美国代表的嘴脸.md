Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 2nd: During the explanation work on October 31st, the American representative in Explanation Tent No. 16 acted unreasonably towards the chairman of the subsidiary body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, arbitrarily insulted him, and attempted to disrupt the explanation work.

    This American representative's name is Phillips. While attacking the Indian chairman of the subsidiary body, he inadvertently revealed that his purpose in causing trouble was to sabotage the explanation work. He said, "I will continue to offer you opinions, and I frankly tell you that doing so will slow down the progress of the explanation work." United Press International revealed on October 19th that American observer representatives had been ordered in a secret meeting to intensify their disruptive behavior in the explanation tents. Phillips' behavior is proof of this arrangement by the American side. The chairman of the subsidiary body told the American representative that his behavior made the members of the subsidiary body "unhappy." The American representative slandered the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary body from various countries, saying that they were "neutral in theory."

    As the afternoon explanation work was about to end, Phillips suddenly stood up and said in a drawn-out voice, "I think the chairman is very unfair because you have given the Korean explanation representatives every convenience. You have given them privileges." This sudden attack baffled the chairman, who asked, "What? What convenience? What privilege?" Phillips then falsely accused the Korean explanation representatives of cursing the prisoners of war and the "United Nations Command." But the chairman said, "I have translators from both sides here, and I didn't hear that."

    The explanation work had not even been going on for eight hours when Phillips complained about why the chairman didn't end the explanation work quickly. He said loudly, "If the Korean explanation representatives ask to continue, I am sure we will be sitting until midnight." The chairman pointed out that this was not true at all and told him, "I don't like any predictions! If you have lost your dignity, you can leave!" Later, Phillips had to "apologize" for his "stupid words."

    However, Phillips then said to the chairman, "You have repeatedly told me to shut up or get out, but you said that after each explanation meeting, I can raise any matters I need to raise." The chairman took out the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Interview Work" from his briefcase and told him, "Not any matters, but any matters that can be interpreted as a violation of the scope of authority."

    Phillips shouted again, saying, "Look, you have once again made a decision without consulting other members!" The chairman said to him, "These are my notes, it's none of your business. I know how to work." The other members had no objection.

    Phillips then threatened, "I will report to my superiors..." The chairman said, "Of course you can do that."

    This explanation tent was originally scheduled to explain to one more prisoner of war. Phillips' unreasonable behavior interrupted the meeting and wasted more than half an hour, so that the explanation work for the last prisoner of war could not be carried out.

    The American side has consistently despised the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and attempted to make the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission obey the will of the United States. The above incident is another manifestation of the American side's arrogant attitude.

### 解释帐篷中一个美国代表的嘴脸

    解释帐篷中一个美国代表的嘴脸
    【新华社开城二日电】十月三十一日解释工作进行时，在第十六号解释帐篷中的美方代表对中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席无理取闹，任意侮辱，企图破坏解释工作。
    这个美方代表名叫菲利普斯。他在攻击附属机构印度主席时，不小心透露出，他进行捣乱的目的就在于破坏解释工作。他说：“我还要不断向你提出意见，我坦白告诉你，我这样做会迟缓解释工作的进行”。合众社在十月十九日就透露：美方观察代表已在一次秘密会议上得到命令，要在解释帐篷中加紧他们的扰乱行为。菲利普斯的行为，是美方的这种布置的一个证明。附属机构主席对美方代表说，他的行为使附属机构的各委员“不高兴”。美方代表竟诬蔑中立国遣返委员会附属机构的各国委员，说他们“在理论上是中立的”。
    在下午解释工作将要结束时，菲利普斯突然站起来，拉长了声调说：“我认为主席是很不公正的，因为你给了朝鲜解释代表一切便利。你给了他们特权。”这个突然的攻击使得主席莫名其妙。他问道：“什么？什么便利？什么特权？”菲利普斯就诬蔑朝鲜解释代表骂战俘和“联合国军司令部”。但是主席说：“我这里有双方的翻译人员，我并没有听见。”
    解释工作进行还不到八个小时，菲利普斯就埋怨主席为什么不赶快结束解释工作。他大声说：“如果朝鲜解释代表要求继续，我可以肯定我们会坐到半夜。”主席指出这根本不是事实，对他说：“我不喜欢任何预言！如果你已失去了你的尊严，你可以出去！”以后，菲利普斯不得不对他的“愚蠢的话”表示“道歉”。
    但是，菲利普斯又对主席说：“你屡次不是叫我闭嘴就是叫我出去，但是你说过，在每次解释会议结束以后，我可以提出我需要提的任何事项。”主席从皮包里找出“解释和访问工作细则”，告诉他：“不是任何事项，而是任何可以被解释为违反职权范围的事项。”
    菲利普斯又叫起来，他说：“你看，你又一次没有征求其他委员的意见就作决定了！”主席对他说：“这是我的注意事项，不是你管的事。我知道怎样工作。”其他委员都没有意见。
    菲利普斯接着就威胁说：“我将报告我的上级……。”主席说：“自然你可以这样做。”
    这个解释帐篷原定还要对一个战俘进行解释。菲利普斯的无理取闹打断了会议，耗费了半个多小时，使得对最后一个战俘的解释工作没有能够进行。
    美方一贯蔑视中立国遣返委员会，并且企图使中立国遣返委员会服从美国的意志。上述事件是美方这种蛮横态度的又一次表现。
