　　The explanation work in the East Camp, since it began on October 15th, has been carried out intermittently under the constant obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. side. After the fifth interruption of the explanation work on the 17th, it has been suspended for several days now. This terrible situation cannot but make every conscientious person feel indignant. However, the U.S. side, on the one hand, secretly rejoices at the serious situation where the explanation work is on the verge of collapse, and on the other hand, uses its propaganda machine to spread lies that distort the truth, attempting to make people believe that it is the Korean and Chinese side that is obstructing the explanation work. This despicable slander by the U.S. side is extremely absurd and extremely shameless.
　　On what grounds and facts does the U.S. side accuse our side of sabotaging the explanation work? Is it that our side has violated the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in dealing with the UN forces refusing repatriation? Has our side taken any actions that violate the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" in the process of explaining to the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side? Absolutely not. Everything our side has done is in complete compliance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits." Even the American lying experts, who are good at fabricating rumors and slanders, cannot find any fault. On the contrary, what the U.S. side is attacking is precisely our side's position of vigorously safeguarding the "Terms of Reference," saying that our side's unwavering stance is an unforgivable "stubborn attitude," and this "stubborn attitude" has led to the destruction of the explanation work. According to the U.S. side's logic, it seems that the explanation work should not be carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," but in accordance with the U.S. side's orders. What strange logic is this! The very nature of this sinful propaganda by American slanderers actually shows that it is the U.S. side, and not anyone else, that is sabotaging the explanation work.
　　The fact is indeed like this. The U.S. side has not stopped sabotaging the explanation work for a single day since the explanation work began (even before the explanation work had begun).
　　The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreed upon by the two sides of the armistice stipulate that both sides should conduct explanations to the prisoners of war within ninety days from the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over the prisoners of war. Our side had long prepared the equipment for the U.S. side to conduct explanations in accordance with the regulations; and although the U.S. side deliberately nitpicked, our side still rebuilt the tents requested by the U.S. side within two days. However, the U.S. side deliberately delayed the explanation work, attempting to grind down the ninety-day explanation period, so that the captured personnel of our side could not hear the explanation. Therefore, from the very beginning, the U.S. side tried its best to unreasonably delay the construction of the explanation tents, and while delaying, they shamelessly described this crime of sabotaging the explanation work as their "victory," complacently saying that "the Allied forces have apparently delayed the Communist side's persuasion of prisoners of war to return home by another four weeks" (Associated Press). It was only because our side made firm efforts and expressed its willingness to help build those tents that the U.S. side had to reluctantly fulfill its obligations. However, the start of the explanation work has been delayed by twenty days. Under such circumstances, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's proposal that the explanation period should be extended is completely fair and reasonable, but the U.S. side stubbornly opposes it, which fully exposes the U.S. side's sinister purpose of delaying the explanation work. It is precisely because of this that after the explanation work began, the U.S. side continued to do everything possible to obstruct the progress of the explanation work, so that the actual time for our side to conduct explanations from October 15th to now has been less than a week in total.
　　But the U.S. side did not stop there. Even during the dozens of hours that our side conducted explanations, the U.S. side did not allow the explanation work to proceed smoothly. On the one hand, agents posing as prisoners of war deliberately shouted and made noise to prevent prisoners of war from listening to the explanation, and on the other hand, the U.S. representatives, observer representatives, and translators constantly made trouble during the explanation. On October 17th, the U.S. representatives and observer representatives in one explanation tent interfered more than ten times, and on November 3rd, an unreasonable disturbance by a U.S. representative delayed the explanation work for forty minutes. And a U.S. representative named Phillips, after making trouble, openly declared to the Indian chairman of the subsidiary body: "I will continue to make suggestions to you, and I frankly tell you that doing so will slow down the progress of the explanation work." Isn't this clear proof that the U.S. side bears an unavoidable responsibility for delaying the explanation work?
　　This is not enough. The U.S. side also used violent means to stifle the prisoners of war's will to be repatriated in order to sabotage the explanation work. The rampant lawlessness of U.S. agents in the detention camps is well known to the world. Recently, the U.S. side has further instructed its agents to strengthen the terrorist rule over the prisoner of war camps and use force to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations. The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have not only suffered mental torture and physical torture, but many people have been killed and even their corpses have been tortured. The U.S. side is trying to quibble and instead attack our side's patient explanation to the prisoners of war as a kind of "mental abuse" and "intimidation and threat" to the prisoners of war. Telling the prisoners of war that they have the right to request repatriation has become "intimidation and threat." Is there any lie more absurd than this? Our side not only wants to tell the Korean captured personnel and let them know that they have complete freedom to go home and live a peaceful life, but also tells the U.S. prisoners of war and let them know that they have complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life. Therefore, our side not only never prevents UN forces prisoners of war from listening to explanations, but on the contrary, repeatedly persuades them to return home. Our side has never carried out any "intimidation and threat" against prisoners of war. Only American thugs specialize in this kind of evil deeds. They not only threaten our captured personnel, but also threaten the prisoners of war on their side. The UN forces refusing repatriation prisoners of war in the North Camp of Panmunjom have been subjected to intimidation and insults by the U.S. side. Can the U.S. side deny the angry protests made by the U.S. and British prisoners of war against them? Can the facts that American conspirators who have painstakingly tried to use prisoners of war (not only Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, but also UN forces prisoners of war) as "cold war" tools intimidated and threatened prisoners of war be denied with empty words?
　　The U.S. side not only adopts delaying and obstructive means against the explanation work, and intimidation and threatening means against prisoners of war, but also adopts contemptuous and troublesome means against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. side obviously intends to turn the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission into its tool for forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The U.S. side first condoned the Syngman Rhee gang's intimidation and abuse of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and then Dulles, Nolan, and Clark personally came forward to launch malicious attacks on it; and instructed agents who sneaked into the detention camps to detain the Indian Custodial Forces Commander Thorat in an attempt to undermine the credibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Later, the U.S. side continued to make things difficult for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with its arrogant actions of opposing and undermining the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits." There are countless such facts. This rude behavior of the U.S. side is in sharp contrast to the attitude of respect and cooperation that our side has consistently adopted towards the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Our side not only handles everything in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," but also takes into consideration the actual difficulties of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as much as possible and provides assistance in many ways. Take the recent facts as an example: Because U.S. agents prevented prisoners of war from listening to explanations, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces failed to arrange the explanation work in accordance with the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits." Our side still agreed to the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and made efforts to promote the resumption of the explanation work. However, the U.S. side continued to instruct the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents to carry out even more rampant sabotage activities, and even attacked our explanation representatives in the explanation tents, causing the explanation work to be forced to stop again after only one day of resumption.
　　All these facts are undeniable. No matter how the U.S. side uses all its newspapers and radio stations to carry out false propaganda, it cannot cover up the U.S. side's crimes of sabotaging the explanation work and its sinister purpose of forcibly detaining our captured personnel.

    美方破坏解释工作的罪行是掩盖不了的
    谭文瑞
    东场里的解释工作自从十月十五日开始以来，一直是在美方百般阻挠与破坏的情况下断断续续地进行。十七日解释工作第五次中断以后，到现在又停顿了好几天。这种恶劣的状况不能不使每一个有良心的人感到愤慨。但是美国方面却一面对解释工作濒于瓦解的严重局面暗自高兴，一面利用其宣传机器散播颠倒黑白的谎言，企图使人相信仿佛是朝中方面在阻挠解释工作。美方的这种卑鄙的诬蔑是极端荒谬，也是极端无耻的。
    美方根据什么样的理由和事实来指责我方破坏解释工作呢？是我方对待联合国军拒绝遣返的战俘有什么违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的行为吗？是我方在对朝中被俘人员进行解释的过程中有什么破坏“解释和访问工作细则”的举动吗？完全不是的。我方的一切所作所为是完全符合“职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”的规定的。即使是善于造谣中伤的美国撒谎专家也找不到任何差错。恰恰相反，美方所攻击的正是我方竭力维护“职权范围”的立场，说我方的这种坚定不移的立场是一种不可饶恕的“顽固态度”，这种“顽固态度”使解释工作遭到破坏。根据美方的逻辑，好像解释工作不是应该依照“职权范围”，而是应该依照美方的命令来进行的。这是何等奇怪的逻辑！美国诽谤者这种罪恶宣传的本身，实际上就已说明了破坏解释工作的不是别人，而是美方。
    事实正是这样的。美方在解释工作开始进行以来（甚至在解释工作还未开始以前），就没有一天停止过对解释工作的破坏。
    停战双方协议的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定，双方应在中立国遣返委员会接管战俘之日起九十天内向战俘进行解释。我方早就按照规定准备了供美方进行解释的设备；而且虽然美方故意挑剔，我方还是在两天之内重新修建了美方所要求的帐篷。但是美方蓄意拖延解释工作，企图把九十天的解释期限磨掉，使我方被俘人员不能听到解释。因此美方一开始就竭力无理拖延修筑解释帐篷，而且在拖延的时候，还无耻地把这种破坏解释工作的罪行说成是他们的“胜利”，洋洋得意地说“联军方面显然已使共方说服战俘回家事又延迟了四个星期”（美联社）。只是由于我方进行了坚定的努力，表示愿意出力把那些帐篷修好，美方才不得不勉强履行了他们的义务。但是解释工作的开始已被延迟了二十天了。在这样的情况下，中立国遣返委员会所提出的解释期限应当顺延的主张是完全公正合理的，而美方却死命反对，这充分暴露了美方拖延解释工作的罪恶目的。正是因为这样，所以美方在解释工作开始以后，继续千方百计阻挠解释工作的进行，使我方自十月十五日开始解释到现在，实际进行解释的时间一共还不到一个星期。
    但是美方并不就此罢休。即使在我方进行解释的几十小时之中，美方也不让解释工作能够顺利进行。一方面冒充战俘的特务故意叫喊吵闹，阻碍战俘听取解释，另一方面美方的代表、观察代表和翻译在解释进行中不断捣蛋。在十月十七日的一个解释帐篷中的美方代表和观察代表就进行了十多次的干扰，在十一月三日美方代表的一次无理取闹把解释工作延误了四十分钟。而一个叫菲利普斯的美方代表在捣乱以后，还公然对附属机构印度主席宣称：“我还要不断向你提出意见，我坦白告诉你，我这样做会迟缓解释工作的进行”。这不是显然地证明美方对于拖延解释工作负有无可逃避的责任吗？
    这还不够。美方并以暴力手段扼杀战俘要求遣返的意志，来破坏解释工作。美方特务在看管营场中的横行不法已为举世所周知。最近美方更进一步指使其特务分子加强对战俘营场的恐怖统治，以武力阻止战俘听取解释。朝中战俘不仅精神上受尽了折磨，肉体上受尽了折磨，而且不少人被杀害后，连尸首也遭到了折磨。而美方竟图狡赖，并反而攻击我方对战俘的耐心解释是一种“精神虐待”，是对战俘的“恫吓和威胁”。告诉战俘有要求遣返的权利，竟成了“恫吓和威胁”，难道还有比这更荒诞的谎言吗？我方不仅要告诉朝被俘人员，让他们知道有回家过和平生活的完全自由，而且也告诉美方战俘，让他们知道有回国过和平生活的完全自由，因此我方不但绝不阻止联合国军战俘听取解释，相反的并曾反复劝说他们回国。我方从来就不向战俘施行任何的“恫吓和威胁”，只有美国暴徒才专干这种恶事，他们不仅向我方被俘人员施行威胁，而且向他们一方的战俘也施行威胁。在板门店北营的联合国军拒绝遣返的战俘就遭受到美方的恐吓与侮辱。美方难道能够否认美英战俘对他们所提出的愤怒抗议吗？处心积虑要把战俘（不只是朝中战俘，而且包括联合国军战俘）作为“冷战”工具的美国阴谋家们恫吓与威胁战俘的事实，难道是可以空口赖得掉的吗？
    美方不但对解释工作采取拖延和阻挠的手段，对战俘采取恫吓和威胁的手段，而且对中立国遣返委员会也采取了轻蔑与刁难的手段。美方显然是打算把中立国遣返委员会变成为它强迫扣留战俘的工具。美方先是纵容李承晚匪帮对中立国遣返委员会进行恐吓与辱骂，继而由杜勒斯、诺兰、克拉克之流亲自出面对它施行恶意的攻击；并指使潜入看管营场的特务分子扣留印度看管部队司令托拉特，以图打击中立国遣返委员会的威信。以后，美方更不断以反对和破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的蛮横举动来与中立国遣返委员会为难。这类事实，是不胜枚举的。美方这种粗暴的行径，与我方对中立国遣返委员会所一贯采取的尊重与合作的态度，适成强烈的对照。我方不但一切按照“职权范围”办事，而且尽量照顾中立国遣返委员会的实际困难，多方予以协助。就以最近的事实为例：由于美方特务阻止战俘听取解释，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队未能根据“解释和访问工作细则”安排解释工作，我方仍然同意了中立国遣返委员会的要求作了努力，以促使解释工作一度恢复。而美方却继续指使蒋李特务进行更猖狂的破坏活动，甚至在解释帐篷中对我方解释代表行凶，致使解释工作刚恢复一天，便又被迫停顿了。
    这一切事实都是不容狡辩的。美方尽管利用它所有的报纸和电台进行虚妄的宣传，也掩盖不了美方破坏解释工作的罪行和强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶目的。
