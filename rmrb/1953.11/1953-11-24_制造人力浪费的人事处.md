    Personnel Department Creates Waste of Manpower
    A reader from the South China Reclamation Bureau writes: I am a staff member of the South China Reclamation Bureau, and I deeply feel that due to the lack of planning in our bureau's personnel work, it has caused a serious waste of manpower and work chaos. Take our bureau's Machinery Division, for example. Starting from April this year, a total of 18 students from Nanjing Agricultural College, Tianjin University, and Hunan Industrial School were successively assigned by our bureau's Personnel Department. At that time, the Machinery Division only needed to add seven people. Because there were more people than work, the leaders of the Machinery Division transferred some students to work at tractor stations and repair shops. When the Personnel Department learned about this, the Director of the Personnel Department blamed the Director of the Machinery Division for not understanding the situation below and arbitrarily assigning people; of course, the Machinery Division was also dissatisfied with the Personnel Department's blame, because the Personnel Department was also responsible for the phenomenon of arbitrarily assigning cadres. One of our comrades works in the Repair Section, and for several months has been doing clerical, statistical, receiving and dispatching, and secretarial work. Once, we offered some opinions on the work, saying: We feel that there is not much work in the section, and it is a waste of the country to have so many people sitting here. The section chief then gave us a very large label, saying that the higher-level Party committee decided that there should be so many people, did we want to overthrow the Party. We simply couldn't accept it and were in pain for several days. We thought, does obeying the organization mean we can't offer opinions to higher levels? In addition, two university graduates were assigned to the repair shop and spent the whole day scraping flat plates and doing odd jobs. They reported this to the central government, and the central government forwarded it to our bureau's Personnel Department for resolution. The Personnel Department said, "Wait for your problem to be resolved." The strangest thing is that although there are already too many people here, the Personnel Department has asked higher authorities for 113 junior high school students who have not yet graduated from the Northeast Harbin Agricultural Mechanization School. Ten more were assigned to our Machinery Division. As a result, there are more and more people in our section who have nothing to do.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    制造人力浪费的人事处
    华南垦殖局读者来信：我是华南垦殖局的工作人员，我深感我局由于人事工作的无计划，造成了严重的人力浪费和工作混乱。以我局的机务处来说，从今年四月起，相继从我局人事处分配来南京农学院、天津大学、湖南工业学校学生共十八人。当时，机务处只要增加七个人就足够了。由于人多事少，机务处领导同志就抽出几个同学到拖拉机站、修理厂工作。这件事被人事处知道了，人事处长就责备机务处长不了解下面的情况随便把人分出去；当然机务处对人事处的责备也不满意，因为造成随便分配干部的现象，人事处也有责任。我们有一个同志在修理科工作，几个月来就是作些文书、统计、收发、秘书的事。有一次，我们对工作提了一点意见说：我们感到科里工作不多，坐这么多人对国家是个浪费。科长就给我们扣了很大的帽子，说上级党委决定有这么多人，你们是不是想推翻党。我们简直接受不了，痛苦了好几天，我们想，难道服从组织就不能向上级提意见吗？另外有两个大学毕业生分配在修理厂，整天刮平板，当杂工，他们向中央反映，中央转我局人事处解决。人事处却说，你们的问题等着吧。最奇怪的是，虽然这里已经到处人多，而人事处又向上级要来东北哈尔滨机耕学校一百一十三名初中未毕业的学生。分到我们机务处的又是十名。这样我们科里没有事做的就越来越多了。
