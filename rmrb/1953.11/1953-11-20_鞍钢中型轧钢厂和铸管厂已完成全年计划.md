Xinhua News Agency Report:

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium-sized rolling mill and casting pipe plant have both completed their annual national production plans ahead of schedule.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium-sized rolling mill comprehensively completed its annual national plan on November 13th. All of the more than forty different specifications of steel rolled as stipulated by the state met the required quality standards; costs were reduced by 2.15% compared to the national plan; and labor productivity was also 15.79% higher than the national plan. The early completion of the annual plan by the medium-sized rolling mill means the early fulfillment of orders from more than 800 units across the country. This plays a significant role in accelerating the country's industrialization. The medium-sized steel produced by this plant has been supplied to the production and construction projects of more than 40 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guizhou, Baotou, Songjiang, Harbin, and Changchun. Large quantities of square steel, hoop steel, flat steel, and angle steel have been supplied to meet the needs of various machinery factories and plant construction. They have also produced light rails that can lay several thousand miles of track. After completing their tasks, the employees of the medium-sized rolling mill wrote to Chairman Mao to report the good news, and pledged to complete the annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy by 200 billion yuan five days ahead of schedule.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's casting pipe plant completed the 1953 national plan 58 days ahead of schedule, and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy was also increased from the original 48.4 billion yuan to 54 billion yuan. All the workers in the plant have put forward the need to further tap production potential and strive to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy ahead of schedule. The campaign for increasing production and practicing economy at the casting pipe plant is closely linked to the general election. The general election movement has greatly enhanced the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. During the competition, good news poured in from various workshops. The quality of iron pipes produced by Class B of the first work section of the first workshop reached a 100% standard for seven consecutive days, and the output increased from more than 150 to more than 190, setting a new record since the plant was built. The third workshop completed the national plan 90 days ahead of schedule.

    鞍钢中型轧钢厂和铸管厂已完成全年计划
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂和铸管厂已先后提前完成全年国家生产计划。
    鞍钢中型轧钢厂在十一月十三日就全面完成了全年国家计划，国家规定他们轧制的四十多种不同规格的钢材，质量全部合乎标准；成本比国家计划减低百分之二点一五；劳动生产率也比国家计划提高了百分之十五点七九。中型轧钢厂提前完成全年计划，就是提前完成了全国各地八百多单位的订货任务。这对加速祖国工业化起着重大的作用。这个厂生产的中型钢材已供应了北京、上海、重庆、天津、贵州、包头、松江、哈尔滨、长春等四十多个城市的生产建设。大批方钢、围钢、扁钢和角钢供应了各地机械工厂和厂房建筑的需要。他们还生产了可以铺设几千里长的轻轨。中型轧钢厂的职工们在完成任务后，已写信向毛主席报捷，并保证提前五天完成全年增产节约两千亿元的计划。
    鞍钢铸管厂提前五十八天完成一九五三年的国家计划，增产节约计划也由原来的四百八十四亿元提高到五百四十亿元。全厂工人们又提出要进一步发掘生产潜力，争取提前完成增产节约任务。铸管厂的增产节约竞赛是密切结合普选工作进行的。普选运动大大提高了工人们当家作主的责任感。在竞赛中，各车间的捷报纷纷传来。第一车间第一工段乙班生产的铁管质量一连七天达到百分之百的标准，产量从过去的一百五十多根提高到一百九十多根，创造了该厂建厂以来的新纪录。第三车间提前九十天完成国家计划。
