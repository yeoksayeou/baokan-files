Conditions for the Development of the Agricultural Production Cooperative Movement in Qin County, Shanxi
By our reporter Lin Wei

The rise of agricultural production cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as agricultural cooperatives) has stirred up the tranquil countryside of Qin County, Shanxi. From last year to this year, even small, remote mountain villages with only three or five households are discussing and concerning themselves with the success and failure of agricultural production cooperation. "The agricultural cooperative family" has leveled those few plots of land, "The agricultural cooperative family" has applied so much manure, soybean cake, and chemical fertilizer to that plot of land, that plot of land is planted with high-yield millet and high-yield corn, it has been plowed so many times, hoed so many times, what new technologies and new agricultural tools have been used, how much grain has been harvested, all the way to how much grain a certain member family has been allocated... all have become the most important news and the most interesting topics in the countryside.

	Ideological Problems Basically Clarified

Two years of practice have basically clarified two main issues in the minds of ordinary farmers.

First, agricultural production cooperatives can indeed grow crops well, produce more grain, and indeed have superiority. When the cooperatives were first established last year, ordinary farmers were skeptical about this: "What superiority or non-superiority! Even biological brothers who grew up on the same teat can't stay together! If they don't leave the land barren, it'll be a miracle!" However, the development of events overturned these predictions. The land of the agricultural cooperatives was not only not left barren, but also grew the best crops. Not only three or two mu of high-yield land, but almost all the land cultivated by the agricultural cooperatives was like that. This situation was already very obvious last summer. It was almost immediately obvious which plot of land was cultivated by the agricultural cooperative: the crops grew lush, strong, dense, and orderly, without diseased plants or missing seedlings, and the land was free of weeds, forming a clear contrast with the crops of ordinary farmers. When the autumn harvest came last year, as soon as the crops of the agricultural cooperatives were brought to the field, before the members could even start, the crowds who came to visit from all the nearby villages were already rubbing the grains off the cobs. Everyone watched the measuring, watched the weighing, from beginning to end, and in the end they were all dumbfounded. The high-yield millet of the East Village cooperative yielded 1,143 jin per mu, and the high-yield corn of the Stone Fire cooperative yielded 1,506 jin per mu. These were harvests that had never been seen or heard of in this rural area since ancient times. In addition to the three mu and two mu of high-yield crops in each cooperative, the five cooperatives also had 82 mu of dry land millet yielding 650 jin per mu, exceeding the local average for ordinary farmers by 3.2 times; 22 mu of corn yielding 970 jin per mu, exceeding the local average for ordinary farmers by 4.8 times. The autumn land of the five cooperatives totaled 949 mu, with an average actual yield of 2.29 dan per mu. Compared with the harvest of these lands in 1951, it exceeded 9.9 dou; compared with the average yield per mu of better mutual aid teams in 1952, it exceeded 4.5 dou; and compared with the average yield per mu of better individual farmers in 1952, it exceeded 6.8 dou. This year, the autumn land of the 47 cooperatives also generally increased production, with an average grain yield of 1.8 dan per mu, exceeding the average yield of ordinary farmers of 1.4 dan by 28.5 percent. Some of the particularly good cooperatives exceeded the masses by a factor of one.

Second, not only can the cooperative produce more grain, but each member household can also actually get more grain. This was also initially doubted by ordinary farmers. They saw that cooperative cadres had to record some workdays in meetings, accountants had to record workdays when calculating accounts, some members who suffered from chronic illnesses also had to be "taken care of" with some workdays (for example, giving them a top of 60 workdays per year, etc.), feeding cattle and herding sheep also counted as workdays, and there were also cooperative expenses for buying fertilizers, agricultural tools, stationery, paper, account books, treating livestock, and cadres receiving travel expenses when attending meetings in the special district and province. So everyone began to worry: "The crops grow well, that's good, but there's a share for the mountain god and a share for the land god, in the end, I'm afraid not much will be left." However, the development of events dispelled this concern as well. The result of the distribution in the five cooperatives last year, with 91 households, was: compared with the income of the previous year (1951), 5 households increased by more than 15 shi, 17 households increased by more than 10 shi, 32 households increased by more than 5 shi, 29 households increased by more than 3 shi, and 7 households increased by more than 1 shi. The remaining one household had the same income as the previous year, with no increase or decrease. In the East Village cooperative, all 20 households increased production by more than 5 shi. According to the statistics of the 47 cooperatives this year, the income of 970 out of 1,000 cooperative members increased. Generally, it increased by about 3 or 4 shi, and some increased by 15 shi or even more than 20 shi. (The 30 households that did not increase or decreased production mostly lost or reduced their labor force this year.)

While clarifying the above basic issues, farmers observed and experienced the superiority of agricultural cooperatives from various angles and aspects. For example, in 1951, the East Village cooperative cultivated the same amount of land with the same labor force, but they couldn't manage it and used 60 short-term laborers in a year, spending 3 shi of millet (no one in the village went out to do short-term work); in 1952, they not only didn't use a single short-term laborer, but also processed the land 430 times
(plowing, hoeing, and harrowing four times each); repaired 1,200 zhang of land edges, built 1,800 zhang of embankments, dug a well, and dug five lying cattle pits (for flood control) and three reservoirs, and improved 10 mu of soil, using a total of 325 workdays. The sum of the two items is 755 workdays. This number should be said to be the surplus workdays. They didn't just cover the embankments with some soil like ordinary farmers, but deeply plowed and finely turned the soil. This year, they planted some hemp on the embankments and harvested 8.5 dan of hemp seeds. This is also something that ordinary farmers find hard to imagine. In addition, last year they earned an extra 110 shi of grain from sideline labor such as artisan work. According to the statistics of the five cooperatives last year, the surplus labor used for land processing and sideline labor reached a total of more than 5,200. The generation of surplus labor is partly the result of collective planned farming and improved labor efficiency, and partly the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women stimulated the enthusiasm of women. Many women who had never "set foot on the ground" now do 30 to 40 or even 70 to 80 workdays a year.

Some farmers have too little land and have to plant too many kinds of crops, so they can't rotate crops and are forced to "repeat crops" (planting the same thing this year as next year, resulting in much less yield), or they are forced to plant millet in wet land (also resulting in much less yield). They particularly noticed the advantages of agricultural cooperatives planting according to the land, planting whatever grows best, and making the most of the land. Some farmers only have a semi-labor force or a weak labor force, or they don't have a "complete expert," so they particularly praised the specialized personnel and responsibilities, and the scientific division of labor in agricultural cooperatives, which can give full play to expertise (such as being able to feed livestock, plow the land, etc.), so that the semi-labor force and the weak can play the role of a full labor force and get the remuneration of a full labor force, benefiting both the public and private. Some farmers have too few people, or are not good at planning agricultural affairs, so they take care of manure but can't take care of repairing the land, they take care of the summer harvest but can't take care of weeding the seedlings, they take care of the autumn harvest but can't take care of plowing the fields. They are always rushing and always end up behind, or they miss many things. They particularly envy the agricultural cooperatives for unified arrangements for farm work, unified allocation and use of manpower, and each person only does a part of the work, but everything can be done ahead of time. Some farmers originally have the ability or conditions to engage in certain sideline occupations, but the work at home and in the fields is always endless, or the people are free but the livestock are not free (farmers in Qin County mostly raise livestock together, and the livestock cannot be used if it is not their turn). They particularly envy the agricultural cooperatives for having specialized personnel to engage in sideline occupations. All these are things that mutual aid teams cannot solve (such as planting according to the land) or are difficult to solve (such as unified arrangements for farm work). This has made ordinary farmers particularly interested in cooperation.

	The Upsurge in Cooperative Establishment and Rectification of Deviations After the Autumn Harvest Last Year

The Party in Qin County has actively led the agricultural production cooperative movement. In the spring and summer seasons of last year, the county continuously carried out the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, criticized the erroneous tendency of the Party not to lead mutual aid and cooperation, allowing rich peasant ideology and capitalist spontaneous forces to run rampant in the countryside, and seriously dealt with some degenerate and deteriorated Party members. As a result, all village branches acted in unison, actively publicizing and organizing farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. In order to make farmers concretely understand the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, they worked hard to run the existing five cooperatives well, and organized county-wide large-scale visits in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, organized mass discussions and deliberations, and stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for advancing towards socialism. Regular and fixed contacts were established between agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, with one cooperative responsible for guiding and promoting one or several teams, and conducting friendly competitions. These efforts rapidly and continuously expanded the influence of the cooperatives to the vast number of farmers. From after the autumn harvest last year to the winter period, the upsurge in cooperative establishment boiled over throughout the county. More than 200 mutual aid teams spontaneously ran to the districts and counties to request approval for cooperative establishment, help with cooperative establishment, or join old cooperatives. Among them, more than 100 spontaneously converted their draft animals into shares, for public ownership and public use, and were ready to immediately put their land into the cooperatives as well. Those who were approved were very excited. Those who were not approved requested approval three or four times, waiting at the district and county governments for several days without leaving. Some even said: "The common people want to establish cooperatives to produce more grain, isn't that illegal?" The responsible comrades of the district and county explained: "Your team has a weak foundation and insufficient conditions, so it won't be able to run well." The reply was: "The masses all know the benefits of agricultural cooperatives, and we have also inquired about the methods of establishing cooperatives. Everyone says we can do it, and we definitely won't run it badly." Several teams were not approved in the county and district, so they came back and set up a "cooperative in name but actually a cooperative," doing it themselves.

(Some of these secret cooperatives later merged into large cooperatives, and some were approved to run themselves.) Because they saw the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, many individual farmers also spontaneously requested to join the cooperatives directly without going through mutual aid teams. Some of them originally had doubts, worrying that their village cooperative might not be able to run well; worrying that joining the cooperative might not be as good as individual farming (for the relatively wealthy); worrying that the labor in the cooperative would be too intense and not casual. But now they all think: "This day will come sooner or later, so let's join now." In short, everyone felt that the world was about to change drastically, and they must decide which direction to go. Where to go? Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are calling on us to go this way, and we can produce more grain, of course we will go this way. The only difference is: some people are firm and clear; some people are following along to try it out.

In the upsurge of cooperative establishment, there were also some hasty and rash deviations that were divorced from the masses. Among them, the deviation that had a decisive impact on the success or failure of cooperative establishment was the blind investment regardless of the farmers' economic strength (such as some cooperatives buying fertilizer with dozens of shi of millet) and the expansion of publicly owned property (such as buying mules, horses, and carts prematurely), which caused the cooperative to incur a large amount of debt at the beginning, scaring away many households who wanted to join the cooperative, especially those with economic difficulties. Some cooperatives also developed formalism and commandism, such as managing members using the method of managing troops. After rectification, these deviations were corrected in time. All the cooperatives began to act according to their own economic capabilities, becoming debt-free or with very little debt (such as reducing debt from tens of millions of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan). The members felt that "the burden was lighter," those with unstable emotions stabilized again, and the masses outside the cooperative no longer felt afraid of joining the cooperative. These measures consolidated the achievements of cooperative establishment last year, and also ensured that no major chaos occurred in cooperative establishment this year. These measures, coupled with the strong leadership of the Party over the 47 cooperatives this year and the promotion of progressive systems such as contracting work to groups and contracting output to groups, have also achieved good results in cooperative establishment this year. This has created better conditions and foundations for the further development of the movement in the future.

	The Foundation of Mutual Aid and the Issue of Leading Backbone

After the central government stipulated the conditions for cooperative establishment, especially after the rectification of deviations, the leading organs of Qin County adopted a cautious attitude towards cooperative establishment and carefully reviewed the mutual aid teams that requested cooperative establishment. This spirit is correct. However, their understanding of the conditions for cooperative establishment, especially the two conditions of the foundation of mutual aid and the leading backbone, was too mechanical and absolute. This is the usual understanding now, that there must be a considerable number of Party members with high prestige in the cooperative to serve as the backbone, and that it must have originally been a good mutual aid team before it can establish a cooperative. Many mutual aid teams requested cooperative establishment last winter, but were not approved because the leaders believed that they did not have or did not fully have the above two conditions. Is it absolutely impossible for these unapproved teams to establish cooperatives? Not necessarily. Baijiagou is a backward village in production in Qin County, and the foundation of mutual aid is not good. There is a Cui Baohai mutual aid team in the village, which was only changed from a seasonal team to a perennial team in 1952, and the issue of equivalence (labor calculation issue) has not yet been resolved. There are only two Party members in the team, and only one is playing a role. They requested cooperative establishment last winter, but the district and county did not approve it, but the team members insisted on doing it. They spontaneously converted their livestock and large farm implements into shares, and also put their land into the cooperative, and started doing it. When rectifying deviations this spring, they rectified it several times without being able to rectify it. Later, the county party secretary personally went to rectify it, but it still didn't work. For this reason, the Changzhi prefectural party committee office was once prepared to issue a circular criticizing it. It just so happened that Changzhi, Licheng, and other counties discovered that some good cooperatives had been forcibly dissolved, which had dampened the enthusiasm of the farmers, so that circular was not issued. The Cui Baohai cooperative was established in this way. Is it running well or not? The district, county, and even the prefectural committee had no confidence. However, the problem was finally concluded by practice. The same 126 mu of autumn land yielded only 202 shi last year, but yielded 256 shi this year, an increase of 54 shi, exceeding last year by 26.7 percent. The Cui Guixin mutual aid team, with 19 households, is the best mutual aid team in the village, with people and manure, but this year it only averaged 1.5 dan of grain per mu; while Cui Baohai's cooperative averaged 2.03 dan per mu, exceeding 5.3 dou, that is, exceeding 35.4 percent. This year's income of each member household, in addition to sideline income, increased by 2 shi or more to 10 shi or more compared with last year. Now the members are very enthusiastic. Under the influence of this cooperative, the Cui Guixin mutual aid team now also wants to establish a cooperative. In addition, some farmers are actively requesting to join the Cui Baohai cooperative. Wu Chousheng and other four households (not within the twelve households) who wavered and left when the cooperative was first established now regret it. Why was the Cui Baohai team so determined to request cooperative establishment? It turned out that Baijiagou village was not very far from East Village, which started to establish a cooperative last spring. The East Village cooperative was the best of the five cooperatives established in the county last year. The crops grew outstandingly well, and the grain harvest was outstandingly large. Among the reasons for the increased production in the East Village cooperative, one made the Cui Baohai mutual aid team particularly interested, that is, establishing a cooperative can plant according to the land, making the most of the land, "planting whatever grows best," instead of "planting whatever we eat." They were particularly interested in this because most of the team members had very little land and could not plant according to the land. The riverside land can clearly yield 3 shi per mu when planting corn, but some team members have to plant millet there, yielding only 1.5 shi per mu. The flat land on Liangshanchuan can yield 3 shi per mu when planting millet, but some team members have to plant sorghum, yielding only 1 shi per mu. Therefore, after they inquired about the methods of the East Village cooperative, they were no longer willing to continue running the team, but wholeheartedly requested cooperative establishment. Their view is: no matter how well the mutual aid team is run, it cannot solve such problems. So, why not take the road that can solve these problems? Because the masses urgently demand to take this road, activists will naturally emerge and become the leading backbone. They actively learn various methods from experienced old cooperatives, and ask the district and county party organizations for help to solve various problems in organizing labor and calculating labor, so that things can move forward. They also actively researched solutions to some problems that have not been solved elsewhere. For example, winter and spring work is relatively easy, while summer and autumn work is relatively hard, so they discussed different scoring methods for different seasons, so that working in winter and spring cannot take advantage, and working in summer and autumn will not suffer.

Among the 47 cooperatives established in Qin County this year, there are several others like the Baijiagou cooperative with very few or non-prestigious Party members. More cooperatives directly established cooperatives without completely solving the equivalence problem when running mutual aid teams, and then gradually solved the equivalence problem (such as implementing contracting work). (The reason why they were able to be approved to establish cooperatives at that time was actually because they had a longer history of mutual aid.) However, because the district and county party organizations actively led and helped them, as a result, each cooperative increased production, and the income of member households generally increased. The conclusion drawn from these facts should be: it is naturally best to have complete and ideal conditions; but if the conditions are not ideal, it is not absolutely impossible to do it. As long as the masses urgently demand it, with activists taking the lead, coupled with the correct guidance of the Party, there is also the possibility of success. Since Qin County is an old liberated area (even the edge of the city was liberated in 1946), the land reform was completed very early, and mutual aid has been carried out for many years, and the Party in the countryside has a considerable foundation, so the conditions for developing this movement should be considered basically good. Based on this, we have the necessity to re-examine the mutual aid teams that urgently requested cooperative establishment last year but were not approved. Many of these teams had their enthusiasm suppressed and damaged because they were not approved to establish cooperatives, coupled with the sarcasm of those in the village who opposed cooperative establishment. However, as long as they are encouraged and helped, they can still become active.

	The Question of "Voluntary Participation of the Masses"

After the correction of "left" leaning deviations, some phenomena of disguised coercion and commandism in cooperative establishment were corrected, and cadres and Party members clarified the decisive condition of "voluntary participation of the masses." This laid a good foundation for the subsequent cooperative establishment work. However, many cadres now often forget the leadership of the Party and forget that the Party's propaganda and education for the masses is of decisive significance when talking about the condition of "voluntary participation of the masses." During the rectification of deviations, necessary education work was not carried out for some hesitant and wavering elements, and they were allowed to leave the cooperative or even persuaded to leave the cooperative. After the rectification of deviations, the propaganda and education on agricultural production cooperatives and the socialist road was greatly weakened. The large-scale visits, cooperative-team connections, and competitions that were conducted last year were also relaxed or abandoned this year. This created a kind of illusion among rural Party members and the masses, thinking that we are no longer advocating taking this road. Therefore, since this spring, new confusion has occurred in the thinking of the masses. Some people are planning to sell a few mu of bad land, make up for the loss, and buy a few mu of good land. Some people want to sell their land to set up stalls, do short-term work, or sell vegetables. Some people even hoard wheat, wanting to make a big profit. Spontaneous capitalist tendencies are developing again in the countryside. This phenomenon is not too common now, but it is worth noting. Some rich peasants and wealthy farmers who have just changed their composition originally held an opposing attitude towards this movement, but they didn't say much last year. Now that they see that we are not promoting and advocating it much, they are recklessly active. On the one hand, they secretly learn the methods of close planting, topdressing, and three-point seedling of agricultural cooperatives, wanting to produce more grain, but on the other hand, they spread rumors about the cooperatives everywhere. When an agricultural cooperative has a dispute over something, they say: "I said they wouldn't be able to do it, and they just can't do it." Seeing that the crops of the agricultural cooperative are growing well, they say: "The crops are good, but the capital is also large. After deducting the capital, it's not as good as us!" (In fact, according to the calculation of the East Village cooperative, one mu of high-yield millet and corn yielding more than 1,000 jin, after deducting the investment, still gets 600 jin more, which is much more than the net income of ordinary land.) When a strong wind blew down the crops in August, they shouted: "The same cough! The agricultural cooperative family has also fallen! Come and see the superiority!" They said to the farmers close to the agricultural cooperative: "Ha Ba Dog is chasing wolves! Are you riding them? Are you running? Why are you running with them?" "Now it's popular to farm individually again, the agricultural cooperative is not working." They give some clothes to some farmers who are relatively poor and intend to join the cooperative, sew shoes, lend some money, and win over their feelings. The purpose is to pull these people to their side, to do short-term work or drive carts for them. Many farmers have also been stirred up by these activities and are hesitant about the cooperative.

To develop cooperatives and the agricultural production cooperative movement, we must occupy the ideological front with active propaganda activities, and use conclusive facts to break all the doubts of the masses, so that the vast number of farmers recognize that this is a road to common prosperity for everyone, and it is the only road they should take. Now, the general farmers in Qin County, except for a small number of people whose land is both good and close, easy to cultivate, with high grain yields, and no difficulties in labor and livestock, who are unwilling to join the cooperative, and the poor farmers who urgently demand to join the cooperative, the general self-sufficient farmers are indifferent. They feel that: the advantage of joining the cooperative is that they can produce more grain, and the advantage of not joining the cooperative is that they are more free, casual, and not restricted; those who have some skills can earn some living expenses, and do not have to wait until the autumn to share dividends like cooperative members. Their general idea is: if the higher authorities are energetic, we will join the cooperative; if the higher authorities are slack, we will wait and see for another year or two. They are constantly listening to the wind and watching the direction, watching the Party's intentions. For this group of people, as long as we patiently and specifically explain the pros and cons to them, make some of the systems in the cooperative more flexible, clarify the prospects, and break some misunderstandings and doubts created by counter-propaganda, they will generally take this road.

Even many relatively wealthy farmers have the same attitude. There is a member of the Baijiagou cooperative named Liang San, who is a wealthy middle peasant. Last year, he saw that the Party was vigorously advocating cooperative establishment, so he joined, and worked very actively. This year, seeing that it was relaxed, he made another plan. He knows how to press oil, and the room and furniture of the oil mill opened by the cooperative are also his. He plans to specialize in the oil mill, sharing dividends according to labor, livestock, and capital. In addition, he will set up a vermicelli workshop, specializing in capital dividends. What about the land? Hand it over to the cooperative to cultivate, and only pay wages himself, and get all the grain. When he discussed this plan with the county party committee, he said: "I think I can farm individually for a few more years. Isn't it also glorious to increase production by farming individually?" After the county party committee told him about the prospects and calculated the current pros and cons (the income of joining the cooperative now is equal to the past), he felt that the prospects for individual farming were not great, and decided to run the cooperative well. He also automatically criticized his rich peasant ideology. Now he is one of the activists in the cooperative.

We advocate "voluntary participation of the masses," but oppose the free-flowism of not propagating or educating, "listening to the masses at will." As long as the Party can actively lead, more masses will voluntarily join the cooperative.

	Overcoming "Cooperative-Centric" Thinking

In order to make this movement develop rapidly, it is also necessary to carry out very good propaganda and education work among the existing cooperative members. Now many cooperative members, although they have joined the cooperative organizationally, their thinking is not yet collectivist. They have initially broken away from the parochialism of the family, but are unconsciously fostering cooperative parochialism. When someone requests to join the cooperative, the members first consider: "We have repaired the land well and fertilized it, and they will come in to take advantage, and we will suffer." So-and-so's household "has bad land," So-and-so's household "lacks labor," or "the labor force is not strong," "letting them in is detrimental to the cooperative." These are of course practical problems, and a reasonable solution should be sought. But the problem is that the general members only focus on seeking how the cooperative can increase income and become prosperous, and do not seek a reasonable solution to the above problems to expand this movement. This emotion has also infected some district-level cadres stationed in the village to guide the cooperative. When these comrades talk about a certain household requesting to join the cooperative, they often add a sentence: "But he does not meet the conditions." What conditions? Cooperatives that lack good land feel that being able to bring in good land meets the conditions. Cooperatives that lack labor feel that having good labor meets the conditions. Cooperatives that lack accountants only want to bring in some "intellectuals."

To carry out collectivist and socialist education for these members, break their "cooperative-centric" thinking and small-group mentality, make them look further, and then guide everyone to specifically discuss and solve various practical problems in absorbing new members, this is not an easy task, but it must be done.

	Summarize the Experience of Cooperative Establishment, So That It Can Be Done Better Next Year

In two years of practice, the cadres of the cooperative and the masses of the members have solved many complex problems and gained rich and vivid experience. If this experience can be systematically summarized and become something that cadres and the masses can master and apply, it will have a huge driving force for the development of the movement. For example, at the beginning of cooperative establishment, the laziness, absenteeism, and sloppy cultivation of a small number of members once affected the unity of the cooperative and the enthusiasm of other members, and the masses also thought that it could not be done. However, as a result of promoting the experience of the Ping Shun Guo Yu En cooperative in contracting work to groups and contracting output to groups, this phenomenon was finally overcome. The process of promoting the system of contracting work to groups and contracting output to groups is also a process of specifically solving their own problems and further creating new experiences. Some cooperatives did not do well in the spring, but did it again in the summer, and did not succeed until the autumn. Women who could not cut 60 millet cobs a day in the past can now cut 60 millet cobs in half a day or even early in the morning. Some people get up before dawn to go to the field to carry millet, and carry it seven or eight times before dawn. The phenomenon of being late and leaving early, and not coming when called, has disappeared. This system has become a recognized good system. If we carefully summarize the process of each cooperative from being unable to promote it to being able to promote it, and the various specific problems that have been solved, new cooperatives will be better organized from the beginning in the future.

In terms of distribution, in order to enable every member, including the members of the rich middle peasant component, to increase production somewhat, at least not to reduce production, they have calculated in various proportions on the issue of the proportion of labor and land dividends, and finally each has found its own appropriate proportion. Obtaining this experience and knowledge will also be very useful for cooperative establishment in the future. It should be summarized.

Technical experience is also important for a new job. For example: this year, during the summer levy of the East Village cooperative, the burden of each member household was calculated according to the number of mu of wheat planted on their land in the cooperative. Whoever planted more wheat on their land had to pay more. However, wheat planting is based on planting according to the land. The land suitable for wheat was planted with wheat according to the cooperative's planting plan. When the wheat was harvested and distributed, it was distributed according to the number of workdays of each household and the total output of summer and autumn land. If you plant more wheat on your own land, you will not necessarily get more. The land of cooperative director Li Furong with a yield of 8 shi is suitable for planting wheat, and all of it is planted with wheat. When distributing wheat, he only received 4.5 dou, but the burden was 8 dou, leaving 3.7 dou. There are three people in the family, and each person has only a little more than one stone. The family of Li Shurong has one person, and only 1.4 dou of arable land can be planted with wheat, but he gets 5 dou, and the burden is only 1.4 sheng, leaving 4.86 dou. According to the general principle, paying more in the summer and paying less in the autumn seems to make no difference. But in today's situation where the price of wheat is higher than the price of rice, some households actually take advantage, and some households suffer. But in other cooperatives, members have created solutions to this problem. The solution of the Chi Fort cooperative is: add up the wheat distributed to each household, divide the total number of stones by the total number of levies, see how much each stone should bear, and then multiply by the number of stones each household gets to determine the number of burdens each household should pay. In this way, those who get more pay a little more, and those who get less pay a little less, and everyone is satisfied. The solution of the Ma Liandao cooperative is: first deduct the total number of wheat levies from the total wheat harvested by the whole cooperative, and then use workdays and land to allocate the remaining amount, and everyone is also satisfied.

For example, when distributing autumn grain, they all adopt the method of "threshing one field and distributing it once," which results in less loss than the method of distributing it all at once after threshing, and can also avoid disputes such as good grain and bad grain. However, it is very time-consuming to divide it in detail every time a field is threshed. Every day it is almost dark before it can be winnowed, and then the accountant has to calculate in detail: how much grain is estimated to be threshed in this field, according to the distribution ratio, how much should be allocated to the public accumulation fund, how much should be allocated to the land, how much should be allocated to the labor force; then calculate how much a workday should be, how much a mu of land (or a stone of yield) should be; then calculate how much each household should get according to the number of workdays and the land, and add them up to determine how much they should get in this field of grain. In this way, it takes half the night to calculate each household for each field, and the members have to bother for half the night to get 1.28 dou of grain. People outside the cooperative said: "The agricultural cooperative is good, but we can't stand that suffering!" Some people who like to gossip deliberately ridiculed when they saw the members: "It can't be divided until midnight, each family must get one or two stones today, right?" The members are very tired, and it is even more uncomfortable to be ridiculed. Some want to withdraw from the cooperative because of this. However, some cooperatives have created simple and easy-to-implement methods. The method of the Yang An cooperative is: as soon as the crops are harvested, everyone carefully estimates the yield (generally the estimate is lower. The reason is that it is easy to handle if it grows more after the distribution, and it is difficult to handle if it is less.) See how much can be harvested in total. Deduct the investment part from the total, and see how much can be distributed in total. Then allocate the public accumulation fund, workdays, and land proportionally, and then calculate the total amount of grain that each household should get this year. So that each household knows the total number of stones they should get this year. In this way, it is very simple to distribute grain every time. Everyone can calculate how much they should get each time. For example, this year the total number that the whole cooperative can distribute is 800 stones, and I am 20 stones. When this field is threshed today, everyone will circle around the grain pile to estimate how much grain it is. For example, if it is 48 stones, everyone will calculate: 48 stones divided by 800 stones, each stone should get 6 sheng today; I have 20 stones, which is 1.2 dou. Another person has 15 stones, and he calculates that he should get 9 dou today. The method of the East Slope cooperative is even simpler: after the first field is distributed, calculate the percentage of the total grain in this field obtained by each household. For example, if I got two stones in the first field, accounting for 2.5 percent. The next field is threshed for 48 stones, and I only need to multiply by 2.5 to know that I should get 1.2 stones. However, ordinary people generally don't understand the meaning of percentage very well. It would be easier to understand if the 2.5 percent was changed to a local saying such as one stone gets 2.5 sheng. Promoting these methods will turn the troublesome calculations that make farmers look away into simple minor matters.

There are many similar specific experiences, all of which are very useful, which are not listed here.

    山西沁县农业生产合作运动发展的条件
    本报记者　林韦
    农业生产合作社（以下简称农业社）的兴起，掀动了山西沁县平静的农村。从去年到今年，连偏僻的三、五户人家的小山庄也都在到处谈论着、关心着农业生产合作的成功和失败。“农业社家”把那几块地修平啦，“农业社家”在那块地上了多少粪、多少豆饼和化学肥料啦，那块地种上高产谷、高产玉茭啦，耕了几遍、锄了几遍啦，用了什么新技术、新农具啦，打了多少粮食啦，一直到某某社员户分了多少粮食啦……都成了农村中最重要的新闻和最饶兴味的话题。
      思想问题基本澄清了
    两年的实践，在一般农民的思想中基本上澄清了两个主要的问题。
    第一，是农业生产合作社的确能够种好庄稼，多打粮食，的确具有优越性。去年初建社的时候，一般农民对这一点是怀疑的：“什么优越性不优越性！一个奶头上吃大的亲兄弟还合不在一堆哩！要不把地荒了才怪哩！”可是，事实的发展把这些预言推翻了。农业社的地不但没有荒了，而且长了最好的庄稼。不但是三、二亩高产地，而且差不多所有农业社种的地都是如此。还在去年夏天，这种情形就很明显了。那一块地是农业社种的，几乎一望即知：庄稼长得油绿，茁壮，稠密，整齐，没有病株和缺苗，地里没有杂草，和一般农民的庄稼形成明显的对比。去年收秋的时候，农业社的庄稼一上场，社员们还没动手，远近各村赶来参观的人群就把粮食颗子给搓下来了。大家围着看过斗，看过秤，从开头看到末尾，最后都目瞪口呆了。东庄社的高产谷，一亩收到一千一百四十三斤，石火社的高产玉茭，一亩收到一千五百零六斤。这是这儿农村中从古以来没有见过也没有听过的收成。除了每社三亩二亩的高产庄稼，当时五个社还有八十二亩旱地谷每亩收到六百五十斤，超过当地一般农民三点二倍；二十二亩玉茭每亩收到九百七十斤，超过当地一般农民四点八倍。五个社的秋地共九百四十九亩，每亩平均实产二石二斗九升。和这些地一九五一年的收成相比，超过九斗九升；和较好的互助组一九五二年的每亩平均产量相比，超过四斗五升；和较好的单干农户一九五二年的每亩平均产量相比，超过六斗八升。今年四十七个社的秋地，也普遍增产，每亩平均收粮一石八斗。与普通农民的平均产量一石四斗相比，超过百分之二十八点五。特好的社，有些超过群众一倍的。
    第二、不仅社里能够多打粮食，而且各社员户也确实能多得粮食。这一点，一般农民起初也是怀疑的。他们看到社内干部开会要记些劳动日，会计算账要记劳动日，有的社员害了长期病也要“照顾”一些劳动日（比方一年给顶六十个劳动日等），喂牛、放羊都要顶劳动日，还有社内买点肥料、农具啦，文具、纸张、账簿啦，牲口看病啦，干部到专区和省开会时发些路费啦，都要社内开支，于是大家便耽心起来：“庄稼长得好倒是好，可是山神爷一份份，土地爷一份份，到头只怕落不下多少。”但是，事实的发展把这种疑虑也打消了。去年五个社，九十一户，分配的结果是：与上一年（一九五一年）收入相比，增加十五石以上的五户，增加十石以上的十七户，增加五石以上的三十二户，增知三石以上的二十九户，增加一石以上的七户。剩下一户，是收入与上年相同，没增没减。东庄社二十户，每户增产都在五石以上。今年四十七个社的统计，一千户社员，有九百七十户收入增加了。一般都增加了三、四石左右，多的增到十五石以至二十石以上。（三十户未增产及减产的，多是今年突然失去或减少了劳动力。）
    在澄清上述基本问题的同时，农民从各个角度各个方面观察与体会着农业合作社的优越性。比如说，东庄社一九五一年以同等的劳动力耕种同等数量的土地，顾不过来，一年用短工六十个，支出小米三石（本村无人出外打短工）；一九五二年不但没有用一个短工，而且在土地上加工四百三十个
  （耕、锄、耙各达四遍）；修地边一千二百丈，垒堰一千八百丈，打水井一眼，挖卧牛坑五个（防洪用）、蓄水池三个，改良土壤十亩，共用工三百二十五个。两项合计是七百五十五个工。这个数目应该说是剩余的工数。他们修边垒堰不是像一般农民那样盖上些土就算，而是深刨细翻。今年在堰上种了些麻，竟收到麻籽八石五斗。这也是一般农民难于想像的事。另外，去年他们搞工匠活之类的副业劳动，还额外赚粮一百一十石。去年五个社统计，用于土地加工和副业劳动的剩余工共达五千二百多个。剩余工的产生，一方面是集体按计划耕作和劳动效率提高的结果，另方面是男女同工同酬的原则刺激了妇女的积极性。有许多从来“不到地踩个脚踪”的妇女，现在一年都做了三、四十个甚至七、八十个劳动日。
    有些农民因为土地太少，要种的作物种类太多，换不转茬，被迫“重茬”（今年种甚明年还种甚，少收很多），或者被迫在下湿地种谷（也少收很多），他们就特别注意到农业社因地种植、长甚种甚，能使地尽其利的优点。有些农户只有半劳力或弱劳力，或者是没有“全把式”，就特别赞扬农业社的专人专责，科学分工，能够发挥专长（比如会喂牲口，会犁地等），使半劳力和弱者起全劳力的作用，得全劳力的报酬，公私两利。有些农户人手太少，或不善于计划农事，顾了弄粪顾不了修地，顾了收夏顾不了锄苗，顾了收秋顾不了垡地，一年紧着赶，总是赶到最后，或误了许多事，他们就特别羡慕农业社由社统一安排农活，统一分配和使用人力，各人只干一部分活，而什么也能弄到最前头。有些农户本来有搞某些副业的本事或条件，但家里和地里的活总是做不完，或者是人有了空牲口没空（沁县农民多半是伙养牲口，牲口轮不到自己家就不能用），就特别羡慕农业社有专人搞副业。所有这些，都是互助组所不能解决（如因地种植）或难于解决（如统一安排农活）的事情。这就使一般农民对于合作发生了特别浓厚的兴趣。
    去年秋后的办社热潮和纠正
        偏向工作
    沁县的党对农业生产合作运动曾进行了积极的领导。去年春夏二季，全县连续开展了反右倾的斗争，批判了党内不领导互助合作，任富农思想和资本主义自发势力在农村自由泛滥的错误倾向，严肃处理了某些蜕化变质的党员，结果就使所有村庄支部都一致行动起来，积极宣传与组织农民走互助合作的道路。为使农民具体了解农业生产合作社的优越性，他们一面努力把已有的五个社办好，一面组织了全县规模的春夏秋三季大参观，组织了群众性的讨论、酝酿，启发大家向社会主义前进的热情。在农业社和互助组之间，建立了经常的和固定的联系，一个社负责指导与推动一个组或几个组，并进行友谊的竞赛。这些工作，使社的影响迅速地不断地扩展到广大农民中去。去年秋收以后到冬季期间，办社的热潮在全县范围内沸腾起来了。自动跑到区里县里请求批准办社，帮助办社或参加旧社的互助组，很快就达到了二百多个。其中有一百多个自动把耕畜都折价归组，公有公用，并准备马上把土地也要入社了。被批准的，都非常兴奋。批不准的，就三番五次的请求，等在区、县政府好几天不走。有的甚至说：“老百姓要求办社多打粮食，总不犯法吧？”区、县负责同志解释说：“你们组基础薄弱，条件不够，办不好。”回答是：“农业社的好处群众都知道了，办社的办法我们也打听好了，大家都说能办，准办不坏。”有几个组在县、区没有被批准，回去就来了个“明组暗社”，自己干起来了。
  （这些暗社后来有的并入大社，有的被批准自办。）单干农民因为看到了农业生产合作社的优越性，也有许多人自动要求不经过互助组直接入社。其中有一些人本来还有疑虑，耽心自己村办社不一定也能办好；耽心入了社也许不如单干（较富裕的）；耽心入了社劳动太紧张，不随便，但现在都想：“终久有这一天，入了就入了吧。”总之，大家都觉得天下要大变了，自己也必须决定方向。往那儿走呢？毛主席、共产党号召我们走这一边，而且能多打粮食，当然就走这一边了。分别只是：有些人是坚定的、明确的；有些人是跟着走，试试看。
    在高涨的办社浪潮中，也夹杂着一些脱离群众的急躁冒进的偏向。其中对办社的成败有决定性影响的偏向，是不顾农民经济力量的盲目投资（如有的社以数十石小米买肥料）和扩展公有财产（如过早地大买骡、马、大车等），使办社一开头就大量负债，吓退了许多想入社的农户，特别是经济困难的农户。也有一些社在发展着形式主义和命令主义，如用管理部队的办法管理社员之类。经过纠偏，这些偏向被及时纠正了。所有的社都开始按照自己的经济能力办事，变成了不负债或负债很少（如由一两千万元债务减到百十万元），社员觉得“头轻了”，情绪不稳定的又稳定了，社外群众对于入社也不觉得可怕了。这些措施巩固了去年办社的成绩，也使今年办社没有发生大的混乱。这些措施加上今年党对四十七个社的大力领导，推行包工包产等进步制度，今年办社的工作也得到了良好的成绩。这给今后运动的进一步发展创造了更好的条件和基础。
    互助的基础和领导骨干问题
    在中央规定了办社的条件之后，尤其在纠偏之后，沁县的领导机关对办社采取了慎重的态度，对要求办社的互助组审查得很认真，这种精神是对的。但是，他们对办社条件尤其是互助基础和领导骨干这两个条件的理解，却过于机械、绝对了。这是现在通常的理解，是必须有相当数量威信较高的党员在社内作骨干，必须原来就是一个好互助组，才能办社。去冬有许多互助组要求办社，就是因为领导上认为它们不具备或不完全具备上述两个条件，所以没有批准。这些没有批准的是不是绝对没有办社的可能呢？不一定。白家沟在沁县是生产上的一个落后村，互助基础并不好。村里有一个崔豹孩互助组，一九五二年才从季节组改成常年组，等价问题（劳动计算问题）还未解决。组内只有两个党员，起作用的只有一个。去冬要求办社，区和县都不批准，但组员们坚持要办。他们自动把牲口、大农具折价入了社，土地也入了社，就干起来了。今春纠偏时，纠了几次纠不开。后来县委书记亲自去纠，还是不行。为此，长治地委办公室曾经准备通报批评。可巧长治、黎城等县发现了有将好社硬性解散，打击了农民热情的，这才没有发出那个通报。崔豹孩社就这样办起来了。办好办不好呢？区县以至地委都无把握。但是，问题终于由实践作了结论。同样一百二十六亩秋地，去年只收二百零二石，今年却收到二百五十六石，增产五十四石，超过去年百分之二十六点七。崔桂新互助组十九户，是村内最好的互助组，有人又有粪，今年一亩只平均收粮一石五斗；而崔豹孩的社却一亩平均到二石零三升，超过五斗三升，即超过百分之三十五点四弱。各社员户今年的收入，除了副业收入以外，比去年增加二石以上至十石以上不等。现在社员们情绪都很高。在这个社的影响下，崔桂新互助组现在也想办社了。另外有一些农户正积极要求加入崔豹孩社。初办社时动摇出去的吴丑生等四户（不在十二户内），现在后悔了。崔豹孩组为什么那样坚决地要求办社呢？原来白家沟村和去年春天就开始办社的东庄离得不很远。东庄社是去年全县所办五个社中最好的一个。庄稼长得突出的好，粮食收得突出的多。东庄社的增产原因中，有一条使崔豹孩互助组发生了特别浓厚的兴趣，这就是办了社能因地种植，地尽其利，“长甚种甚”，而不是“吃甚种甚”。他们对这一点所以特别发生兴趣，是因为组员们多半土地很少，无法因地种植。河边地明明种玉茭一亩能收三石，但有的组员却不得不在那儿种谷，一亩只收一石五。梁山川上的平地种谷一亩能收三石，有些组员却不得不种高粱，一亩只收一石。所以，他们在打听清楚东庄社的办法以后，就再也不愿意继续办组，而一心要求办社了。他们的看法是：互助组办得再好，也不能解决这样的问题。那么，为什么不去走能够解决这问题的道路呢？因为群众急切要求走这条道路，积极分子就自然产生出来，成为领导骨干。他们主动地向有经验的老社学习各种办法，向区和县的党组织请求帮助，解决组织劳动和计算劳动中的各种问题，使事情能够向前推进。有些别处没有解决了的问题，他们也积极地研究出解决的办法。比如冬季和春季的工比较苦轻，夏季和秋季的工比较苦重，他们就商量出不同季节不同记分的办法，使冬春作活不能占便宜，夏秋作活不会吃亏。
    在沁县今年所办的四十七个社中，像白家沟社这样党员很少或威信不高的社还有好几个。原来办互助组没有完全解决等价问题而直接办起社来，然后逐步解决等价问题（如实行包工）的更多。（当时所以能够被批准办社，其实是因为它们互助历史较长而已。）但是，由于县区的党组织对它们进行了积极的领导和帮助，结果各社都增产了，社员户的收入也普遍增加了。这些事实引出的结论应该是：具有完备的合乎理想的条件自然最好；但是如果条件不够理想，也不是绝对不能办。只要群众迫切要求，有积极分子带头，加上党的正确指引，就也有办成的可能。由于沁县是老解放区（城边也是一九四六年就解放了的），土地改革完成得很早，搞互助也已多年，农村的党有相当基础，所以发展这一运动的条件，应该认为基本上是好的。据此，我们就有对去年迫切要求办社而没有得到批准的互助组重作审查的必要。其中有许多组因为没有被批准办社，加上村里反对办社者的冷嘲热讽，他们的热情受了压抑和损伤。但是，只要给以鼓励和帮助，他们还是可以积极起来的。
    “群众自愿”问题
    在“左”倾偏向纠正以后，办社中的一部分变相强迫命令的现象纠正了，干部、党员对于“群众自愿”这个决定性的条件明确了，这给以后的办社工作打下了良好的基础。但是，现在许多干部在谈到“群众自愿”这个条件时，却往往忘记了党的领导，忘记了党对群众的宣传教育有决定的意义。纠偏时，对于一些犹疑不定的动摇分子没有进行必要的教育工作，就任其出社甚至劝其出社了。纠偏以后，对于农业生产合作社和社会主义道路的宣传教育大大减弱了。去年曾经进行的大规模参观、社与组联系、竞赛之类的工作，今年也放松了或放弃了。这就在农村党员中和群众中造成一种错觉，以为我们又不提倡走这条道路了。所以，今春以来，群众的思想上又发生了新的混乱。有人在打算卖上几亩坏地，贴赔上点，买几亩好地进来。有人想卖了地去摆摊子，打短工或贩卖菜蔬。有人甚至囤积小麦，想赚大利。自发的资本主义倾向，又在农村中发展。这种现象现在还不太多，但值得注意。有些刚刚改变了成分的富农和接近富农的富裕农民，本来对这一运动就抱着反对态度，可是去年都不大说话。现在看见我们不大宣传倡导了，就放肆地活动起来。他们一面暗暗学习农业社的密植、追肥、三定苗之类的办法，想多打粮食，一面却到处说社的坏话。农业社为一件什么事发生了争论，他们就说：“说他们办不成，就是办不成。”看见农业社庄稼长得好，他们就说：“庄稼好，可是本钱也大。除了本，还不如咱哩！”（实际上据东庄社计算，一亩收一千多斤的高产谷和玉茭等，除了投资还得六百几十斤，比一般地的纯收入多得多。）八月间大风刮倒了庄稼，他们就大喊：“一样咳！农业社家也倒啦！快来看优越性！”他们对接近农业社的农民说：“哈八狗撵狼哩！乘撵哩？乘跑哩？你跟上人家跑甚哩？”“现在又兴单干了，农业社不时行了。”他们给某些生活比较困难、有意入社的农民送件布衫啦，缝缝鞋啦，借给几个钱啦，拉拢感情。目的是把这些人拉在自己身边，给他们做短工或赶大车。有不少农民也就被他们这些活动搅得心里七上八下，对社忽近忽远。
    要发展社，发展农业生产合作运动，就必须以积极的宣传活动来占领思想阵地，以确凿的事实，打破群众的一切疑虑，使广大农民认识这是一条大家共同富裕的路，是他们唯一应该走的路。现在沁县的一般农民，除了土地既好又近、种地省力、收粮也多、劳力畜力都无困难的少数人不愿入社，而困难农户则迫切要求入社以外，一般能够自给的农户，态度是入社也可，不入社也可。他们觉得：入社的好处是能够多打粮，不入社则比较自由，随便，不受约束；有点手艺的，可以赚些活钱零花，不必像社员那样等到秋后一总分红。他们一般的想法是：上级闹得起劲了，咱就入社；上级松了，就再等一、二年看看。他们时常在听风声，看风向，看党的意图。对于这一批人，只要耐心地具体地给他们讲明利害，把社内某些制度改得灵活一点，说清前途，打破反宣传给他们造成的某些误解和疑虑，他们一般都会走到这条路上来的。
    甚至有许多比较富裕的农户，态度也是如此。白家沟社有一个名叫梁三的社员，是个富裕中农。去年他看见党大力倡导办社，就进来了，干得还很积极。今年看见松了，就另打了个算盘。他会榨油，社内所开油坊的房间和家具也是他的。他就打算带着牲口专干油坊，按人力、牲口和资本分红。另外再搞个粉条坊，自己专以资本分红。土地呢？交给社耕种，自己只掏工资，得全部粮食。他拿这一计划和县委商量时说：“我看又能好好单干几年。单干增了产不是也光荣吗？”县委给他讲了前途，计算了目前利害（现在入社收入和过去相等）之后，他又觉得单干前途不大，决心好好搞社了。还自动检讨了自己的富农思想。现在他是社内积极分子之一。
    我们主张“群众自愿”，但是反对那种不宣传、不教育，“悉听群众自便”的自流主义。只要党能积极领导，就会有更多的群众自愿入社。
    克服“社本位”思想
    为了使这一运动迅速发展，在现有的社员中也需要进行很好的宣传教育工作。现在有许多社员，组织上虽然入了社，思想却还不是集体主义的。他们初步摆脱了家庭的本位主义，但却非自觉地滋长着社的本位主义。在有人请求入社的时候，社员们首先考虑的是：“咱们把地修好了，种肥了，他们进来沾光，咱们受累”，某某户“土地不好”，某某户“缺劳动力”，或“劳动力不强”，“放进来对社不利”。这些当然都是实际问题，应该谋求合理的解决。但问题在于一般社员只是集中谋求本社如何增加收入，走向富裕，而不去谋求上述问题的合理解决，以扩展这一运动。这种情绪，也传染了一部分驻村指导办社的区级干部。这些同志在谈到某某户请求入社的时候，时常加上一句：“可是他不合条件。”什么条件呢？缺好地的社，觉得能够带进好地来就合乎条件。缺劳力的社，觉得是好劳动力就合乎条件。缺会计的社，只想拉个把“知识分子”进来。
    对这些社员进行集体主义和社会主义的教育，打破他们的“社本位”思想和小团体主义，使他们把眼光放远一点，然后引导大家具体讨论与解决吸收新社员中的各种实际问题，这是一个不很容易作、但又非作不可的工作。
      总结办社经验，使明年办得
        更好
    办社干部和社员群众在两年的实践中，解决了许多复杂的问题，获得了丰富而生动的经验。这些经验如能系统地总结起来，成为干部群众都能掌握运用的东西，对于运动的发展将发生巨大的推动作用。比如说，办社之初，少数社员的懒散旷工现象和耕作马虎现象，曾经影响了社的团结和其他社员的积极性，群众也因此认为办不成。但是，推行平顺郭玉恩社的包工包产经验的结果，终于克服了这种现象。推行包工包产制的过程，也是具体解决自己问题和进一步创造新经验的过程。有些社春季没有搞好，夏季又搞，一直到秋季才搞成。从前一天切不了六十个谷的妇女，现在只用半天甚至一清早就切了六十个。有的人天不明起来上地担谷，担了七、八趟天才亮。迟到早退、叫也叫不来的现象消灭了。这种制度，已经成为公认的好制度。如果把各社从推行不开到推行开的经过和解决过的各项具体问题细致加以总结，将来建新社时一开始就会搞得比较好的。
    在分配方面，为了使每一个社员，包括富裕中农成分的社员都能多少增产，至少不减产，他们在劳力和土地分红比例的问题上用多种比例计算过，最后各自求得自己的适当比例。这种经验与知识的取得，对于将来办社也是极有用的。应该加以总结。
    技术性的经验，对于一个新的工作来说也是重要的。举个例子说：东庄社今年夏征的时候，各社员户的负担是按自己入社土地上种麦的亩数来计算的。谁家土地上种麦多，出的负担也多。但种麦是因地种植的。适于种麦的地，都按社的种植计划种了麦。收下麦子分配时，是按各户劳动日和夏秋土地总产量分配的。自己土地上种麦多，并不一定分得多。社长李富荣有八石产量的耕地适于种麦，都种了麦，分麦时只分到四石五斗，但负担却出到八斗，剩下三石七斗。家有三口人，一人只一石多。李树荣家一口人，只有一石四斗产量的耕地能种麦，却分得五石，负担又只出一斗四升，实剩四石八斗六。按一般道理说，夏季多负担，秋季就少负担，似乎没什么差别。但在麦价高出米价的今天，实际是有些户占了便宜，有些户吃了亏。但在另外一些社，社员们就创造了解决这一问题的办法。池堡社的办法是：把各户分得的麦子加起来，以总石数除总征收数，看一石应负担多少，然后再拿各户分得的石数一乘，确定各户应出负担数。这样，分得多的多出一些，分得少的少出一些，大家都满意。马连道社的办法是：先把麦征总数从全社收麦中抛去，然后用劳动日和土地来分配所余数目，各户也满意。
    又比如，分配秋粮时，这里都采取“打一场分一场”的办法，这比打完以后一次分的办法损耗要少些，同时可以避免好粮坏粮之类的纠纷。但是，每打一场就细分一次，是非常费时间的。每天天快黑才能扬出来，接着就得由会计详细计算：这场估计打下多少粮，按分配比例，公积金该分多少，土地共该分多少，劳动力共该分多少；然后计算一个劳动日该多少，一亩地（或一石产量）该多少；然后逐户算出劳动日应分多少，土地应分多少，加起来，才能确定他在这场粮食中该分多少。这样每场一户户算下去，社员们每分石二八斗粮食都要麻烦半夜。社外群众说：“农业社好是好，可是咱受不了那份罪！”有些好说风凉话的，见了社员就故意奚落：“半夜三更分不完，今天一家准分一、二十石吧？”社员们疲倦得很，再受些奚落，更难受。有因此想退社的。但是，有一些社却自己创造了简单易行的办法。杨安社的办法是：庄稼一割，大家便仔细估计一下产量，（一般都估得低一些。原因是分了以后长出来好办，短下不好办。）看一共能收多少。总数中除去投资部分，看可以分配的总数是多少。然后拿公积金、劳动日和土地按比例分配，再把各户今年应分的总粮数算好。使各户都知道今年自己应分总石数。这样，每场分粮的时候就十分简单了。每一个人自己都可以计算出来每场应分数。比如说，今年全社可以分配的总数是八百石，我自己是二十石。今天这一场打下来了，大家就转圆圈步一下粮堆，估计是多少粮。比如说是四十八石，大家就算啦：八百石除四十八石，一石今天该见（得）六升；我二十石，就是一石二斗。另一个人是十五石，他就算出他今天该分九斗。东坡社的办法更简单：分了第一场以后，就将各户所得数占这场总粮数的百分比算出来。比方我第一场分了两石，占百分之二点五。下一场打了四十八石，我只用二点五乘一下，就知道自己该得一石二。不过老百姓一般还不大懂百分比的意思。如果把百分之二点五改说成一石得二升五之类的土话，那就更好懂了。这些办法一推广，就会把农民望而生畏的麻烦计算变成简单的小事。
    类似的具体经验还很多，都很有用，这儿不列举了。
    〔注〕今年十月下旬中共山西省委扩大会议之后，沁县县委现正检查过去对农业生产合作运动的领导。初步检查到的是：一、去年秋冬以来把办社的条件看得太绝对，甚至神秘化了；二、幻想初建新社就丝毫不乱；三、对于“巩固”的方针，过去的理解是机械的，放松了为发展作准备的宣传活动。现在他们的口号是“为再建五十个新社而斗争”。从该县的工作基础和群众条件看，只要党能加强领导，并正确掌握政策，这一口号的实现是可能的。
