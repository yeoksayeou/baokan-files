Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 23rd: Indian newspapers have published editorials opposing the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance currently under negotiation, and denouncing the U.S. plot to establish military bases within Pakistan.

    The "National Herald" published an editorial on the 17th stating: "The Middle East defense organization and bilateral military alliances currently being planned by the United States are aimed at expanding the dangers of the Cold War and hot war to the borders of India, and to the borders of Afghanistan and Burma, because the United States wants to establish bases in both West and East Pakistan."

    The editorial pointed out: "The United States' search for bases in South Asia is by no means for the security of the United States. Its purpose is nothing more than aggression. The security and independence of South Asian countries will be genuinely and greatly threatened, and this threat will never come from the Soviet Union."

    The editorial said: "The claim that the United States is only eager to strengthen Pakistan's military strength and that assistance is not attached to any conditions is nonsense that no one can believe. Although the State Department denies that the issue of bases is being discussed, a military alliance may already exist, but the issue of bases and many secret clauses have not been publicly announced. Moreover, there is undeniable news that Washington is urging Pakistan to form a military alliance with Turkey. Turkey is already a partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and it is clear that negotiations have reached a further stage."

    Commenting on the visits of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army to Turkey and Washington, and the Governor-General of Pakistan to Washington, the editorial said: "All of these are by no means accidental. There have been constant and reliable reports that Turkey and Pakistan will soon form an alliance as the starting point for the establishment of a Middle East defense system under the auspices of the United States."

    The editorial concluded: "The plan for Pakistan to join the military alliance system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is no small matter, but a very serious event, which will not only have a great impact on the Indian subcontinent, but also on the entire Southeast Asia."

    The Urdu "New Era" newspaper's editorial on the 18th said: "The fact that American imperialists are preparing to sign military treaties with countries thousands of miles away shows that this treaty is not for defense, but for aggression. The borders of the United States do not extend to the Himalayas or the Ravi River or the Sutlej River (western Pakistan), enough to allow the United States to claim that its security in these areas is threatened in any way. On the other hand, Pakistan is not threatened with aggression by any of its neighbors, so no one can believe that the United States, which claims to be the 'protector of weak countries,' is helping it at Pakistan's request." "The signing of this treaty is in line with the military needs of these imperialists. These imperialists have long wanted to draw Middle Eastern countries into a military organization to realize their war plans in Central and Eastern Asia. But these plans of theirs have repeatedly failed."

    The "Today" newspaper published an editorial on the 10th saying: "If Pakistan and the United States sign this treaty, it will not only bring crisis to its people, but also threaten the Middle Eastern countries, India, and Southeast Asian countries, because no matter what reaction Pakistan's decision may produce, it will affect these countries."

    The "Freedom Daily" pointed out in its editorial on the 17th: "The Pakistan-U.S. military treaty will be met with fierce protests from world public opinion."

### 印度舆论反对谈判中的美巴军事协定

    印度舆论反对谈判中的美巴军事协定
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】印度各报纷纷发表社论，反对正在谈判中的美国与巴基斯坦军事同盟，并斥责美国企图在巴基斯坦境内建立军事基地的阴谋。
   “国民先驱报”十七日发表社论说：“美国目前正在计划的中东防御组织和双边军事同盟，是要把冷战和热战的危险扩大到印度的边境，并扩大到阿富汗与缅甸的边境，因为美国在西巴基斯坦与东巴基斯坦都要建立基地。”
    社论指出：“美国在南亚寻找基地绝不是为了美国的安全，其目的无非是为了侵略，南亚各国的安全与独立都将受到真正的极大的威胁，而这种威胁绝不会来自苏联方面。”
    社论说：“所谓美国只是急于要加强巴基斯坦的军事力量而对于援助并不附有任何条件的说法，是没有人能够相信的无稽之谈。虽然国务院否认正在讨论基地问题，但是可能已经有了军事同盟，只是关于基地问题和许多秘密条款没有作公开的宣布罢了。而且还有无可否认的消息说：华盛顿正在促使巴基斯坦与土耳其成立军事同盟。而土耳其已经是北大西洋公约组织的小伙伴了，显然谈判已经达到进一步的阶段。”
    在评论巴基斯坦陆军总司令访问土耳其和华盛顿以及巴基斯坦的总督访问华盛顿的时候，社论说：“所有这些都绝不是偶然的事，曾经不断有可靠的消息说，土耳其与巴基斯坦不久就要结成同盟，作为在美国主持下的中东防御体系建立的起点。”
    社论最后说：“巴基斯坦加入北大西洋公约组织的军事联盟体系的计划，绝不是小事情，而是非常严重的事件，这不仅对于印度次大陆一定会有极大的影响，而且对于整个东南亚也会有极大的影响”。
    乌尔都文“新世纪报”十八日的社论说：“美帝国主义者准备和远在几千英里之外的国家签订军事条约，这表明这个条约并不是为了防御，而是为了侵略。美国的边界并没有伸展到喜马拉雅山或者拉维河或萨特里杰河（巴基斯坦西部），足以使美国能够宣称它在这些地区的安全遭到了任何威胁。在另一方面，巴基斯坦并没有受到它的任何邻国发动侵略的威胁，因此没有人能相信自称为‘弱小国家的保护者’的美国是应巴基斯坦的请求来援助它的。”“签订这个条约是符合于这些帝国主义者的军事需要的。这些帝国主义者很久以来一直想把中东国家拉进一个军事组织，以实现他们在亚洲中部和东部的战争计划。但是他们这些计划均不断遭到失败。”
   “今天报”十日发表社论说：“如果巴基斯坦和美国签订这个条约，那不仅会给它的人民带来危机，而且也会威胁到中东国家、印度以及东南亚国家，因为不论巴基斯坦的这种决定会产生什么反应，都是会对这些国家发生影响的。”
    “自由报”在十七日的社论中指出：“巴基斯坦—美国军事条约将会遭到世界公众舆论的剧烈的抗议。”
