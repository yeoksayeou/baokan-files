    On a certain coast of the motherland.
    At dusk, the clouds in the sky and the sea are connected, a hazy gray.
    Shen, the company commander of a certain PLA unit guarding the coast, was talking with several soldiers in the square when suddenly a messenger ran up to him in a hurry and shouted behind him, "Report! Company commander, telephone! It's from the radio station." Everyone immediately felt that something urgent was about to happen when they heard that the call was from the radio station, and they immediately became nervous. The company commander ran towards the company headquarters as if flying. The soldiers followed him to the company headquarters.
    "...Oh! Right...Got it, we'll leave immediately." The company commander put down the telephone, said a few words in a low voice to the instructor standing next to him, and immediately called Liang, the deputy platoon leader on duty, and ordered, "The radio station just called and said there will be a typhoon tonight. You immediately gather the whole company to help the fishermen push their boats."
    The team was assembled.
    After Instructor Huang explained the situation, someone in the team shouted, "We guarantee to complete the task!" "We will never let the folks suffer any losses."
    So, the work was immediately divided: the first platoon went to Tiger Bay, the second platoon went to Ghost Bay, the third platoon went to Temple Bay, and the fourth platoon and the company headquarters went to Gongluo Bay. The team set off running, as if participating in a battle.
    II
    It gradually got dark. The garrison appeared particularly quiet. Soldier Lin Pingqing was lying in bed because of a sore foot. The squad leader hadn't told him that a typhoon was coming and the whole company had gone to push the boats. Lying in bed, he had already felt the strangeness of the silence after dusk. Now, suddenly, he heard a series of increasingly urgent "heave-ho, heave-ho" sounds from the seaside. He knew that an emergency had occurred and could no longer lie down. He jumped out of bed and limped out. – “Report! Report! Report!” He shouted three times in front of the company headquarters, but no one answered. The messenger ran out of the telephone room and asked loudly, "Lin Pingqing? What's the matter? The company commander and comrades have gone to Gongluo Bay to help the fishermen push their boats."
    Lin Pingqing opened his eyes wide and asked, "What, push boats? Push what boats?"
    The messenger said with a smile, "A typhoon is coming tonight, didn't you know?..."
    When Lin Pingqing heard that he was helping the fishermen push their boats, he turned backwards as if his foot didn't hurt anymore, and ran straight to the dormitory. Before long, he ran out again. He was covered with flashlights, half-jumping and half-running towards Gongluo Bay.
    As he approached the seaside, between the sounds of "heave-ho, heave-ho," he constantly heard the fishermen's grateful voices:
    "Thank you, comrades, thanks to your help in pushing the boats. You not only saved the boats, but also saved our lives." An older fisherman was saying to the company commander.
    "You are really our benefactors! When the Kuomintang bandit troops were here, they not only didn't help push the boats, but they wouldn't even tell us when a storm was coming; we had to judge for ourselves, and if we couldn't, the whole family would be food for the fish." This was a woman saying, "Three years ago, there was a storm, and because there weren't enough people, there wasn't enough time to push the boats, and two boats were broken by the waves. If you hadn't notified me tonight, I would have gone out to sea..." Then she repeated the sentence: "You are really our benefactors!"
    "When the typhoon passes and we go out to sea to catch fish, we will definitely send dozens of catties to the comrades to eat." This was a child's voice.
    At this time, Lin Pingqing arrived, and the comrades blamed him when they saw him: "Your foot is hurt, what are you doing here?"
    "I came to bring you flashlights! It's so dark!" Lin Pingqing replied triumphantly. "We were in such a hurry that we forgot to bring flashlights. It's good you came!" A soldier said gratefully.
    At this time, everyone saw his air of being covered in flashlights and couldn't help but laugh.
    When the last fishing boat on the beach was pushed up, the assembly whistle sounded. A line of troops was immediately formed on the beach.
    "Comrades! Our task tonight is not yet complete." Instructor Huang shouted at the top of his voice, "More than twenty boats that went out during the day have not returned yet. We just had the radio station send a telegram to the rear, asking them to send patrol boats quickly to the sea to notify the fishing boats to return. Comrades, take a rest first, and when the boats come back, we must push them all ashore."
    "We must push them all ashore!" Such a shout echoed in the team.
    III
    The night was pitch black, and you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. The waves were hitting the beach and rocks, louder and louder. Judging from experience, the typhoon was coming soon! Everyone's mood became more and more uneasy. At this time, a messenger ran up breathlessly and shouted, "Report to the instructor, the radio station received a telegram from the rear saying that patrol boats had already been sent out to patrol."
    Everyone was relieved for the most part and began to wait anxiously again. Dozens of flashlight beams crossed the undulating sea surface, like searchlights, illuminating very far away.
    Before long, several star-like lights appeared in the distance.
    "Look! Isn't that the light on the mast?"
    Everyone shouted excitedly, and the dull seaside became noisy again. Someone, anxious, shouted at the light: "Hurry up and row, the typhoon is coming soon!"
    Suddenly, a series of muffled thunders rolled across the sky and sea, drowning out the shouts. Then, heavy rain poured down.
    The light gradually dimmed and disappeared. The comrades' shouts ceased with the disappearance of the light. At this time, Instructor Huang's shout rang out: "Comrades! Hold on for another half an hour, the boats will be here! Does everyone have the determination?"
    "Yes!"
    This resolute voice overwhelmed the thunder and rain.
    In less than half an hour, the light on the ship's mast appeared again. Excitement gripped the hearts of every soldier and fisherman, the shouting started again, the light became brighter and brighter, the ship got closer and closer, and it was ashore! The soldiers braved the heavy rain and rushed to the beach, followed by waves of "heave-ho, heave-ho" sounds. Before long, more than twenty fishing boats were pushed ashore.
    An old fisherman, wearing a raincoat and just coming ashore, bared his thick arms and held the company commander's hand tightly with both hands, and said after a long while: "It was your patrol boat that found us, you are really..."
    He couldn't continue, his lips trembled, and he continued to hold the company commander's hand tightly, unwilling to let go.
    The rain got heavier, and the wind got stronger. The typhoon was coming. However, no matter how strong the wind and rain were, they could no longer damage the fishing boats, because these fishing boats had been safely pushed ashore.

    怒海狂风
    郑扫
    一
    在祖国某处海岸上。
    黄昏时分，天上的乌云和海水连在一起，灰朦朦的一片。
    守卫在海防上的解放军某部沈连长正在广场上和几个战士谈话，突然通讯员匆匆跑来在他身后喊道：“报告！连长听电话，是电台打来的。”大家一听说是电台来的电话，马上感到要有什么紧急情况发生，立刻显得紧张起来。连长飞也似地向连部跑去。战士们也跟着他跑到连部来。
    “……噢！对……知道，我们马上出发。”连长放下了电话机，和站在他旁边的指导员低低说了几句，马上把值星员梁副排长找来，命令道：“刚才电台打来电话，今晚要来台风。你马上集合全连同志去帮渔民推船。”
    队伍集合好了。
    黄指导员把情况一讲，只听见队里有人在喊：“我们保证完成任务！”“决不让老乡受到损失。”
    于是立即分工：第一排到虎湾，第二排到鬼湾，第三排到庙湾，第四排和连部一起到铜锣湾。队伍就像参加战斗一样，跑步出发了。
    二
    天渐渐黑了下来。驻地显得格外寂静。战士林平青，因为脚痛，正在床上躺着，班长并没有告诉他台风要来，全连都去推船的消息。他躺在床上，本来已经对今天黄昏以后的寂静感到异样。现在，突然从海边传来一阵紧似一阵地“咳哟，咳哟”的拉号子声。他知道发生了紧急情况，再也不能躺下去了。他跳下床一拐一拐地走了出来。——“报告！报告！报告！”他在连部门前连叫三声都没人答声。通讯员从电话室里跑出来，高声问：“林平青吗？有什么事情？连长和同志们到铜锣湾帮渔民推船去了。”
    林平青睁大了眼睛问道：“什么，推船？推什么船呀？”
    通讯员笑着说：“今晚要来台风，你都不知道吗？……”
    林平青一听是帮渔民推船，一个向后转，好像脚也不疼了，直向寝室跑去。不大工夫，又跑了出来。只见他满身挂着电筒，半跳半跑地奔向铜锣湾去了。
    快到海边时，在拉号子声的间隙里，不断听到渔民们感激不尽的声音：
    “谢谢同志们，多亏你们帮助推船。不但救了船，也救了我们的命。”有一位年纪比较大的渔民在跟连长说。
    “你们真是我们的恩人！国民党匪军在的时候，他们不但不帮助推船，就是什么时候打风也不告诉我们；全靠自己睇，要是睇不到的话，全家就得喂鱼。”这是一位妇女在说，“三年前打了一次风，因为人少，来不及推船，就被大浪打破了两条。如果你们今晚不通知我，我就出海去了……”接着她又重复了那句话：“你们真是我们的恩人！”
     “等台风过去了，出海打到鱼，一定给同志们送几十斤吃。”这是一个小孩的声音。
    这时候，林平青来了，同志们一看到他就责问道：“你脚坏了，来干什么？”
    “给你们送电筒来的呀！天多黑啊！”林平青得意地回答道：“走的匆忙，连电筒都忘带了，你来的好！”一位战士感激似地说。
    这时大家看到他满身挂着电筒的神气，不禁都大笑起来。
    当海边的最后一支渔船被推上来以后，集合哨响了。沙滩上马上排好了一列队伍。
     “同志们！我们今晚的任务还没完成。”指导员放大嗓门喊道，“白天出去的二十多条船，直到现在还没回来。刚才让电台给后方发了电报，叫那里派巡逻艇赶快出海通知海里的渔船回来，同志们先休息一下，等船回来我们要全部推上岸来。”
    “一定要全部推上岸来！”队伍里好像回音一样响起了这样的喊声。三
      漆黑的夜，伸手不见掌。海浪拍打着沙滩和岩石，哗啦哗啦地，越来越响。凭经验判断，台风快来了！大家的心情也越来越不安起来。这时，一个通讯员气喘吁吁地跑来喊道：“报告指导员，电台收到后方来的电报，说早就派巡逻艇出去巡查了。”
    大家这才放了一半心，又开始了焦急的等待，几十只电筒光交叉在波涛起伏的海面，像探照灯似的，照得很远很远。
    不一会儿，只见远处出现了几点星星样的火光。
    “看啊！那不是桅杆上的灯吗？”
    所有的人都兴奋地嚷起来了，沉闷的海边一时又喧闹起来。有人对着那点火光急得直喊：“快摇橹吧，台风快要到了！”
    突然，一串闷雷滚动在天空和海面，盖住了喊声。接着大雨倾盆而下。
    灯光渐渐黯淡了，看不见了。同志们的呼喊随着这消失的灯光而静止下来。这时，响起了指导员的喊声：“同志们！再坚持半个钟头，船就会到了！大家有没有决心？”
      “有！”
    这坚决的声音，压倒了雷声和雨声。
    不到半点钟，船桅杆上的灯光又出现了，兴奋抓住了每一个战士和渔民的心，喊声又起来了，灯光愈来愈显，船愈来愈近，靠岸了！战士们冒着大雨一直冲向沙滩，接着又是一阵阵的“咳哟，咳哟”声。不大一会工夫，二十多条渔船都推上岸了。
    一个披着蓑衣刚刚上岸的老渔民，裸着粗壮的胳膊，双手紧紧地握着连长的一只手，好半天才说：“是你们的巡逻艇把我们找回来的，你们真是……”
    他说不下去了，嘴唇颤动着，继续紧握着连长的手不肯放。
    雨大了，风也大了。这是台风来了。但是，风雨多大，再也吹打不坏渔船，因为这些渔船已被安全地推上岸了。
