Film distribution units in Jiangxi, Hebei, Anhui, and other places have achieved good results in educating the broad masses of audiences by emphasizing the publicity and organization of newsreel documentaries and enabling the screening of newsreel documentaries to achieve good results.
	In the past, cinema workers in Jiangxi province did not pay much attention to the screening of newsreel documentaries, lacking interest and confidence in their projection. They believed that "audiences don't like to watch documentaries," but in reality, they themselves didn't like them. When documentaries were scheduled, they would frown, waiting for the screening period to pass as if they were going through a trial, and therefore, there was no talk of publicity and organizing audiences. In order to change this situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation sent people to assist cinemas, focusing on publicity and organizing audiences for several documentaries. The film "Against Bacteriological Warfare" achieved relatively significant success. When this film was screened in the first-run cinemas in Nanchang, Jiangxi, the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation first contacted the cinemas, repeatedly explaining the political significance of the film, breaking down the cinema workers' mindset and abandoning their past erroneous views of not valuing newsreel documentaries. Then, they united with the cinemas to work together. They proactively obtained the assistance of the Jiangxi Provincial Party and government leaders, and published articles in the "Jiangxi Daily" recommending the film. They also mobilized the cinemas' publicity staff to go deep into factories, government agencies, and densely populated residential areas to carry out publicity and organize basic audiences. Their experience proves that once the masses are organized, attention should be paid to preparing for screenings, especially the on-screen explanations, so that the audience can understand the film and be interested in watching it. When this film was screened in various parts of Jiangxi province, the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation also planned and selectively sent people to various screening cities to assist cinemas in publicity and organizing audiences. The results of this approach are that, on the one hand, the documentary achieved good screening results, and on the other hand, the cinema staff realized in the process of participating in publicity and organizing audiences that documentaries are not unpopular with audiences. As long as publicity and organization work are done well, the number of documentary viewers is no less than the number of feature film viewers. For example, when the documentary "Against Bacteriological Warfare" was screened in Jiangxi in May, the audience in three cinemas in three cities was 43,787, accounting for 59.7 percent of the local population; when the feature film "Southward March Northward War" was screened in four cinemas in four cities, the audience was 40,354, accounting for 19.9 percent of the total local population. The populations of Jiujiang and Ji'an in Jiangxi province are similar. When the film "Against Bacteriological Warfare" was screened in Jiujiang, because it was a temporary urgent screening and no publicity was done, the audience was only 2,754. However, when the film was screened in Ji'an, the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation sent people to assist the cinema in publicity work, and the audience reached 15,546. Currently, some cinemas in Jiangxi province have proactively requested to screen documentaries, such as requesting the screening of "Lenin Canal" and "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War."
	The experience of the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation shows:
	I. Compared with other films, newsreel documentaries are more time-sensitive, so they should be screened in close combination with the current political movements, central tasks, and current affairs studies. Therefore, the scheduling of documentaries should pay more attention to the screening effect according to the specific situation, and it is not allowed to treat them as "padding material." Only by closely cooperating with various political movements and central tasks can we more effectively obtain the guidance and assistance of relevant departments. The important reason why the screening of "Against Bacteriological Warfare" was able to achieve better results was that it was combined with the "Patriotic Health Campaign" carried out by the people of the whole country. II. Break down the projectionists' thinking that they do not value documentaries. The film distribution leading organization should send people to assist them in doing publicity and organizational work. When the projectionists know the fact that the audience does not dislike documentaries, they will pay attention to the publicity and organizational work of screening documentaries in their thinking. III. It is very important to do a good job of explaining the documentary so that the masses can understand the film and feel interested in it. Otherwise, if the masses do not understand it once, they will not come next time. IV. Summarize experience in a timely manner, consolidate achievements, and regularize the publicity work of newsreel documentaries. In the past, the Jiangxi Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation cooperated with screening units to achieve better screening results for some films, but when a film was screened and the comrades sent back, the cinema's publicity work remained the same. In the future, the experience of good publicity and organizational work should be affirmed and let the screening units master it themselves, and enable them to give play to their initiative and creativity, and maintain the regular screening of newsreel documentaries.
	When the Hebei Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation distributed the documentary "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War," because the distribution staff realized that this was a documentary with great political and educational significance, they took the initiative to contact the Hebei Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association, obtained the association's assistance, and the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Baoding Municipal People's Government jointly convened a meeting to make specific divisions of labor in organizing the audience, and published articles in the "Hebei Daily." Therefore, it mobilized the broad masses to watch this film. It was screened continuously for 25 shows, with an audience of 50,500.
	When the Anhui Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation distributed the newsreel documentary "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War" in Hefei, in addition to fixed screenings, it also made additional screenings in a thematic manner. Because sufficient preparations were made in advance, the office contacted the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Anhui Daily, People's Radio Station, Hefei Wired Radio Station, and other units, and carried out extensive publicity, which made the film's screening results better.
	When the Jiaxing People's Cinema in Zhejiang Province screened newsreel documentaries, they used advertising columns to write down the names and contents of the newsreels being screened at the same time and post them in the most noticeable place at the entrance of the cinema. They also used slides, microphones, posters, blackboard newspapers, and street display windows to introduce the film content. This is very helpful in guiding the audience to watch newsreel documentaries.

    江西、河北等地的电影发行单位
    组织观众看新闻纪录影片有成绩
    江西、河北、安徽等地的电影发行单位，由于重视新闻纪录影片的宣传组织工作，使新闻纪录影片的放映收到良好的效果，教育了广大观众。
    江西地区的电影院工作人员，过去不太重视新闻纪录片的放映，对新闻纪录片的映出缺乏兴趣和信心。他们认为“观众不喜欢看纪录片”，实际上是自己不喜欢。排到纪录影片时，他们就绉眉头，像过关似地等着映期过去，因此更谈不上宣传和组织观众的工作了。中国电影发行公司江西省办事处为了改变这种情况，曾派人协助电影院，着重做了几部纪录片的宣传和组织观众的工作。其中成绩较大的是“反对细菌战”影片。这部影片在江西南昌首轮影院映出时，中国电影发行公司江西省办事处首先与影院取得联系，反复说明该片的政治意义，打通影院工作人员的思想，使他们放弃过去那种不重视新闻纪录片的错误观点后，和影院联合起来，共同进行工作。他们主动地取得了江西省党、政领导同志的帮助，在“江西日报”上发表文章推荐这部影片。又发动电影院的宣传员深入各工厂、机关、居民集中地区进行宣传、组织基本观众的工作。他们的经验证明：群众组织起来后，即应注意作好有关放映的准备工作，特别是映间解释工作，使观众看懂电影，看得有兴趣。这部影片在江西省各地映出时，中国电影发行公司江西省办事处并有计划、有重点地派人到各上映城市协助电影院做宣传和组织观众的工作。这样做的结果，一方面使该纪录片获得了良好的映出效果，另一方面也使影院工作人员在参加宣传和组织观众的工作中，认识到纪录片并不是不为观众喜爱的。只要很好地做了宣传、组织工作，纪录片的观众并不比故事影片的观众少。如五月份在江西地区放映纪录片“反对细菌战”时，三个城市的三个影院，观众为四三、七八七人次，占当地总人口百分之五九点七；故事片“南征北战”在四个城市的四个影院上映时，观众是四○、三五四人次，占当地人口总数百分之十九点九。江西省九江市和吉安市的人口是相差不多的，“反对细菌战”影片在九江上映时，因系临时急映，没有做宣传工作，结果观众只有二、七五四人次，而该片在吉安放映时，因中国电影发行公司江西省办事处曾派人前往协助影院做了宣传工作，观众达一五、五四六人次。目前，江西省有些影院已主动要求映出纪录片，如要求放映“列宁运河”“交换病伤战俘”等。
    中国电影发行公司江西省办事处的经验说明：
  一、新闻纪录片与其他影片比较，更富于时间性，所以应紧密地结合当前政治运动、中心工作和时事学习而映出。因此纪录片的排映，更要根据具体情况，注意映出效果，不容许把它当作“补垫材料”。也只有紧密地配合各项政治运动和中心工作，才能更有效地取得有关部门的指导和协助。“反对细菌战”的映出之所以能获得较好的成绩，很重要的原因是结合了全国人民所进行的“爱国卫生运动”。二、打通放映人员不重视纪录片的思想。电影发行领导机构应派人协助他们做好宣传、组织工作，当放映人员知道观众并不是不喜欢纪录片的事实后，他们就会从思想上重视放映纪录片的宣传、组织工作。三、做好纪录片的解释工作，使群众看懂电影，并感到兴趣，是很重要的。不然，群众一次看不懂，下次就不会来了。四、及时总结经验，巩固成绩，使新闻纪录片的宣传工作能经常化。过去中国电影发行公司江西省办事处曾与放映单位合作，使一些影片得到了较好的映出成绩，可是当一部影片映完后，派去的同志回来了，影院的宣传工作依然如故。今后应该把好的宣传、组织工作的经验肯定下来，让放映单位自己掌握，并使他们发挥主动性和创造性，保持经常做好新闻纪录片的映出工作。
    中国电影发行公司河北省办事处在发行纪录片
  “交换病伤战俘”时，因为发行工作人员认识了这是一部很有政治教育意义的纪录片，所以先主动与河北省抗美援朝分会联系，取得了该会的协助，并由中共河北省保定市委、保定市人民政府共同召开会议，作了组织观众的具体分工，并在“河北日报”上发表了文章，因此，发动了广大群众看这部影片。连续映出二十五场，观众达五万零五百人次。
    中国电影发行公司安徽省办事处在合肥发行新闻纪录影片“交换病伤战俘”时，除固定放映场次外，又以专题方式作了加场放映。因事先作了充分的准备工作，该处与文化事业管理局、安徽日报、人民广播电台、合肥市有线电台等单位联系，进行了广泛宣传，使该片的映出成绩较好。
    浙江省嘉兴市人民电影院映出新闻纪录片时，曾利用广告栏，把同时上映的新闻短片的名称、内容写好，贴在影院门口最注目的地方，并利用幻灯片、话筒、海报、黑板报、街头橱窗介绍影片内容，这样对引导观众看新闻纪录影片有很大作用。
