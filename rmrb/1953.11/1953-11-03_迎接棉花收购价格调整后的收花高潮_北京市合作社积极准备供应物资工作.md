To Meet the Cotton Purchase High Tide After Cotton Purchase Price Adjustment
Beijing Cooperatives Actively Prepare Supply Materials

    With the adjustment of cotton purchase prices in early November, the amount of cotton entering the market will increase significantly. In order to meet the high tide of cotton purchases, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation and cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have actively carried out preparatory work such as replenishing supply materials.
    The cotton purchase work of Beijing cooperatives in September and October progressed relatively smoothly because they had made relatively full preparations in advance, trained cotton grading cadres, actively prepared supply materials, and cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas held meetings of cotton farmer representatives to widely publicize seasonal price differences for cotton. Farmers generally sold cotton in accordance with the spirit of the national seasonal price difference regulations. The amount of cotton purchased in September and October basically met the original purchase plan.
    In late October, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation and relevant units such as the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee studied and determined the first upward adjustment of cotton purchase prices, and issued a notice on October 30, instructing affiliated cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas to purchase cotton at the new prices starting from November 1. The notice issued by the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation on October 30 pointed out: November is the time for picking mid-season cotton and collecting cotton taxes, and with the seasonal price difference for cotton being adjusted upward, it is estimated that a large amount of cotton will flood the market. In order to meet this high tide of cotton purchases in a planned and step-by-step manner, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas must do the following work well: 1. Accelerate capital turnover, strengthen transportation, and overcome phenomena such as the accumulation of seed cotton at grassroots cotton collection stations and processing plants waiting for materials. 2. All grassroots cotton collection stations should improve work efficiency and appropriately allocate manpower, improve work and reduce cotton farmers' waiting time under the principle of increasing production and practicing economy. 3. Do a good job in supplying materials. Understand the needs of farmers in depth, fully prepare general merchandise, floral cloth, floral serge, autumn grain, coal, fertilizer, etc., appropriately expand reserves, and ensure the supply of materials. In mid-October, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation convened a meeting of responsible cadres for supply work from suburban cooperatives to check the supply of materials. After the meeting, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas further replenished supply materials by organizing farmers' spare carts to transport goods and expanding commodity reserve quotas. The commodity reserve quota of the East Suburb Cooperative increased by 11 percent, and the Second Joint Cooperative of the Nan Yuan District also increased its funds by 100 million yuan. The East Suburb Cooperative recently added a sales booth at the cotton collection station in Xiaoying Village to facilitate farmers' purchase of goods after selling cotton.
    The notice from the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation also specifically pointed out that while vigorously carrying out the work of purchasing cotton, the work of purchasing autumn grain and other items must still be vigorously carried out and should not be neglected in the slightest; work should be organized and divided so that they advance simultaneously, in order to successfully complete various purchase tasks.

    迎接棉花收购价格调整后的收花高潮
    北京市合作社积极准备供应物资工作
    十一月初，棉花收购价格调整后，棉花上市量将大量增加。为了迎接收购棉花的高潮，北京市供销合作总社和各产棉区合作社积极进行了充实供应物资等准备工作。
    北京市合作社九、十月份购棉工作，由于事先进行了比较充分的准备，训练了棉花验级干部，积极准备了供应物资，各产棉区合作社并召开棉农代表会议，广泛宣传了棉花季节差价，从九月中旬开始收购新棉以来，工作进展比较顺利。农民一般都能按照国家规定季节差价的精神出售棉花。九、十月份收购棉花的数量，基本上符合原订收购计划。
    十月下旬，北京市供销合作总社和北京市人民政府财政经济委员会等有关单位研究确定了第一次上调的棉花收购价格，并于十月三十日发出通知，指示所属各产棉区合作社，从十一月一日起按新价格收购棉花。北京市供销合作总社十月三十日发出的通知中指出：十一月里正是中喷花摘收，赋棉开征的时候，又逢棉花季节差价上调，估计大量棉花将涌上市场。为了有计划有步骤地迎接这一收花高潮，各产棉区合作社必须作好下列工作：一、加速资金周转，加强运输，克服基层收棉站积压籽棉，加工厂停车待料等现象。二、各基层收棉站应提高工作效率，并适当地调配人力，在增产节约的原则下改进工作，减少棉农等候时间。三、作好物资供应工作。深入了解农民需要，充分准备百货、花布、花哔叽、秋粮、煤炭、肥料等，适当扩大储备量，保证物资供应。在十月中旬，北京市供销合作总社即曾召开郊区合作社供应工作负责干部会议，检查了物资供应工作。会后，各产棉区合作社通过组织农民空闲大车运货，扩大商品储备定额等办法，进一步充实供应物资。东郊区合作社商品储备定额增加了百分之十一，南苑区第二联社也增加了一亿元资金。东郊区合作社最近还在小营村收棉站增设了售货摊，便利农民卖棉后购买货物。
    北京市供销合作总社的通知中还特别指出，在大力进行收购棉花工作的同时，对于收购秋粮等工作，仍须大力开展，不得稍有忽视；应组织分工同时并进，以期胜利完成各项收购任务。
