    Publication of the First Volume of "Collected Works of Qu Qiubai"

    The first volume (including volumes one and two) of "Collected Works of Qu Qiubai" has been published by People's Literature Publishing House and is scheduled to be officially released by China Book Distribution Company in Beijing on November 5th.

    "Collected Works of Qu Qiubai" collects all the literary works and translations of the revolutionary martyr Qu Qiubai. Volume 1 includes: "Preface," "Record of Starvation in Russia," "Heart History of the Red Capital," "Two Short Essays Written After Returning from Russia in 1923," and other content. Volume 2 includes: "Literary Miscellany," "Ramblings," "Further Collection of Literary Miscellany," and other content.

    The literary legacy of martyr Qu Qiubai is a very valuable asset in modern Chinese literature. These works not only engaged in courageous struggles on the revolutionary cultural front during the dark era of reactionary rule in the past, exerting an indelible and significant influence on literary thought, but also maintain their combative significance and educational role even today. "Heart History of the Red Capital" in Volume 1 is one of the earliest works in China to describe the social, political, and economic conditions of the Soviet Union.

    Volumes three through eight of "Collected Works of Qu Qiubai," divided into three books, will also be published successively within this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “瞿秋白文集”第一册出版
    “瞿秋白文集”第一册（包括一、二卷）已由人民文学出版社出版，定十一月五日由中国图书发行公司在北京正式发行。
    “瞿秋白文集”收集了革命先烈瞿秋白在文学方面全部的著作和翻译，卷一包括：“序”、“饿乡纪程”、“赤都心史”、“一九二三年由俄归国后所作短文二篇”等内容；卷二包括：“文艺杂著”、“乱弹”、“文艺杂著续辑”等内容。
    瞿秋白烈士的文学遗著，是我国现代文学中非常宝贵的财产。这些作品不但曾经在过去反动统治黑暗时代的革命文化战线上进行过冲锋陷阵的斗争，在文艺思想上发生了不可磨灭的巨大影响，就是在今天也仍然保持着它们的战斗的意义和教育的作用。卷一中的“赤都心史”是我国最早的描写苏联社会、政治、经济各方面情况的著作。
    “瞿秋白文集”卷三到卷八，分为三册，也都将在今年内陆续出版。（新华社）
