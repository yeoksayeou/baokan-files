    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 31st: The explanation work, which had been interrupted for eleven consecutive days, resumed on the 31st. According to the plan, today's explanations were directed towards captured personnel of the Korean People's Army.

    Today's explanation situation very clearly demonstrated that, after more than ten days of meticulous arrangements by the US side, the Syngman Rhee gang's special agents have become even more desperate in sabotaging the explanation work. However, after our side's explanations, twenty-one people still applied for repatriation on the spot.

    While listening to the explanations, in addition to coercing prisoners of war to shout and make noise, the special agents also came up with some new tricks to make trouble. In explanation tent No. 13, a person with elaborate attire and shiny leather shoes deliberately stayed in the explanation tent to delay time by using the method of "remaining silent." He stalled from 9:35 AM to 11:15 AM, and finally left after shaking hands with the US "observer representative." In explanation tent No. 6, another person, in addition to cursing in English for a while, used the same method to sit silently for forty minutes.

    During the explanation process, the US "observer representatives" and "detaining power representatives" openly threatened prisoners of war and interfered with the explanation work with even more shameless tactics. In explanation tent No. 6, when a prisoner of war mechanically said "no repatriation," the US "representative" actually applauded, which was stopped by the Indian chairman. In this explanation tent, US personnel also signaled the prisoners of war listening to the explanation with their eyes. After protests from our observation representatives, Brigadier General Gaole, Chief of Staff of the Indian Custodial Forces, issued a notice to each explanation tent, announcing that this situation would not be allowed to happen again.

    In explanation tent No. 1, the US "detaining power representative" protested to the chairman, arguing that our explanation representative's address to the prisoners of war as "comrades" constituted a threat to the prisoners of war. This unreasonable "protest" was rejected and refuted.

    In another explanation tent, the US "detaining power representative" also attempted to oppose the legitimate authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. At that time, a special agent entered the tent and tried to assault the explanation representative. The Indian chairman warned him that if he did it again, he would be arrested; and asked for his name and detention number. The US "representative" shouted "unacceptable" and left the tent. In explanation tent No. 11, the US "representative" constantly used his finger to point at the door for those who had not applied for repatriation to threaten the prisoners of war during the conversation.

    The US side sending special agents to act as "representatives" to enter the explanation tents to threaten prisoners of war was once again proven in today's explanation work. In explanation tent No. 2, a Syngman Rhee special agent acting as a US "representative" was smugly watching a prisoner of war making trouble under their coercion when, unexpectedly, the prisoner of war turned around and asked him: "Chairman, can I go back?" This "Chairman" did not expect his identity to be exposed and looked up at the top of the tent in embarrassment.

    The US personnel's interference in the explanation tents threatened the prisoners of war listening to the explanations. In explanation tent No. 13, a captured person walked in, saw our explanation representative, and said: "Representatives, you've worked hard!" But when he suddenly saw the US "representative" behind him leaning out his head, looking at him fiercely, he panicked and shouted loudly. However, despite the intimidation of the US special agents and the threats of the US "representatives" in the explanation tents, twenty-one captured personnel of the Korean People's Army bravely expressed their desire to be repatriated. At about 9:00 AM, the first person who requested repatriation just walked out of the explanation tent and said excitedly to the Korean-Chinese representatives: "I have been looking forward to the explanation every day, my heart is burning with impatience!"

    连续中断十一天的解释工作昨天恢复
    朝鲜人民军被俘人员二十一名申请遣返
    美李特务极端无耻地干扰解释工作的进行
   【新华社开城三十一日电】连续中断达十一天的解释工作，在三十一日恢复进行。按照计划，今天是向朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。
    今天的解释情况非常清楚地显示出，经过美方十多天周密的布置，李匪特务对破坏解释工作已更加穷凶极恶。但是经过我方解释后，仍有二十一人当场申请遣返。
    在听解释时，特务分子除了胁迫战俘大叫大嚷外，又要了一些捣乱的新花样。在第十三号解释帐篷，有一个服装讲究、皮鞋发亮的人，用“保持沉默”的办法，故意呆在解释帐篷里拖延时间。他从九时三十五分一直磨到十一时十五分，才在最后和美方“观察代表”握手后离开。在第六号解释帐篷里，有另一个人除了用英语叫骂了一阵外，用同样的办法静坐了四十分钟。
    在解释过程中，美方“观察代表”和“拘留方代表”公然威胁战俘、干扰解释工作的手段也愈加无耻。在第六号解释帐篷里，一个战俘机械地说“不遣返”时，美方“代表”竟然鼓起掌来，当被印度主席制止。在这个解释帐篷中，美方人员还向听解释的战俘以眉目示意。经我方观察代表抗议后，印度看管部队参谋长高尔准将向每个解释帐篷发出通知，宣布不许再有这种情况发生。
    在第一号解释帐篷中，美方的“拘留方代表”向主席提出抗议，理由是我方解释代表在解释时称呼战俘为“同志”。他说这就构成对战俘的威胁。这种无理取闹的“抗议”，遭到了拒绝和驳斥。
    在另一个解释帐篷中，美方的“拘留方代表”还企图反对中立国遣返委员会的合法权力。当时，一个特务分子进帐篷后要对解释代表行凶。印度主席警告他，如果再这样做，就要加以逮捕；并问他的姓名和拘留编号。美方“代表”竟大喊“不能容忍”，退出帐篷。在第十一号解释帐篷，美方“代表”在谈话时不断用手指未申请遣返的门来威胁战俘。
    美方派遣特务充当“代表”进入解释帐篷来威胁战俘，这在今天的解释工作中再一次得到证明。在第二号解释帐篷里，一个充当美方“代表”的李承晚特务正得意地看着一个在他们的胁迫下进行捣乱的战俘时，冷不防这个战俘回过头来问他：“委员长，我能不能回去？”这位“委员长”没有想到会暴露了他的身份，狼狈不堪地抬起头来看帐篷顶。
    美方人员在解释帐篷中的干扰行为威胁着听取解释的战俘们。在第十三号解释帐篷里，一个被俘人员走进去，看到了我方解释代表，就说：“代表们辛苦了！”可是当他忽然看到在他侧后的美方“代表”伸出头来，凶狠地看着他时，他就惊慌失措地大嚷大叫起来。然而，尽管有美方特务的恫吓和美方“代表”在解释帐篷中的威胁，仍有二十一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员勇敢地表示了要求遣返的愿望。上午九时许，第一个要求遣返者刚走出解释帐篷，就激动地对朝中代表说：“我天天望解释，心都等焦了！”
