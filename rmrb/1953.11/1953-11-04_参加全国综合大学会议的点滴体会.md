    Some Thoughts on Attending the National Comprehensive University Conference
    Yang Xiangkui, Director of the History Department, Shandong University
    The National Comprehensive University Conference convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government in September was a timely conference. Over the past four years since liberation, a series of reforms have been carried out in higher education, and the achievements of these reforms must be affirmed. However, it should be said that the fundamental problems of comprehensive universities, their direction, tasks, and training objectives, as well as the proper position of comprehensive universities, have been vague. It is natural that a school with a vague direction and task will not attract attention in society, and many people feel that it is dispensable. The number of students applying for admission over the years also reflects this phenomenon. One comprehensive university had only seventeen applicants this year, and the most did not exceed seven hundred. This conference pointed out that comprehensive universities should be an important symbol of national cultural and scientific development. However, the public has such an incorrect understanding of it, and general high school graduates are unwilling to apply, thinking that it is a school without a future. Even some teachers who teach in comprehensive universities are unwilling to let their children apply to such schools.
    The above situation fully illustrates that the current comprehensive universities are not yet an important symbol of the cultural and scientific development of New China. They are far behind reality and are not valued by society. This is mainly due to their own imperfections. Since this year, China has entered a new period of planned construction, and these problems must be solved. Through this conference, these problems have indeed been solved, so I say this is a timely conference.
    School education is a superstructure and has class character. Schools in capitalist countries have their own set of methods. In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial era of old China, school education also had a piecemeal approach, because old China was a semi-colony and a target of aggression by various imperialist countries. Therefore, the school education system of old China was pieced together from various countries. It successively copied the educational systems of Japan, Germany, Britain, France, and the United States, especially the educational system of American imperialism, which had the most adverse impact on China. Before and after liberation, various imperialist schools still existed in major cities in China. In these schools, teachers lectured in foreign languages, and even Chinese history had to be taught in English. What was even more strange was that the earthworms used for biology experiments were all American goods! If there was a system of our own at that time, it was the combination of the semi-feudal system with it. This phenomenon was exposed a lot during the ideological remolding last year.
    This old education system cannot serve the construction of New China. We must have an education system that suits our construction needs. Our education system must be an integral part of the overall national system, that is, education must serve the national general line. The leading comrades who presided over this meeting emphasized this point, and everyone clearly recognized this point. This should be one of the basic gains of this meeting.
    The conference also discussed teaching plans for various subjects. I participated in the history professional group. Through several discussions on teaching plans, I more clearly recognized the superiority of professional teaching and the class character of history. I realized that the old historical circles in China before liberation had embarked on a very narrow path. The work of collecting historical materials and textual research certainly has its certain significance and value, but this is by no means the whole of history, and it cannot be said that there is no historical science other than the work of historical materials. Unfortunately, many people in the past thought and acted in this way, which cannot be regarded as a deviation. However, an even greater mistake was being dominated by the idealist view of history of historical accidentalism. In terms of teaching plans, it was chaotic, unsystematic, without an overall concept of history, nor a concept of historical development, emphasizing ancient history and neglecting modern and contemporary history. Of course, we are not saying that ancient history is not important, but neglecting modern history, "knowing the past but not the present" is not right. As for our failure to pay attention to the development and integrity of social history, only doing piecemeal research, with dynastic history and imperial genealogy as the main aspects of research, it is an incorrect direction. In fact, the way out for the old historical circles before liberation was getting narrower and narrower, and everyone was confined to a small world.
    For the above reasons, old history workers once felt distressed at the beginning of liberation. They taught in universities, but the old knowledge could not be used, and the new one had not yet been established, and they could not find a correct direction for their own research work. In the past three or four years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, various universities have carried out ideological remolding and systematic study of Marxism-Leninism, so the historical circles have also undergone significant changes, analyzing and criticizing the old, and striving to learn the new. Although the development situation is still different, they have all changed. The debate on the history teaching plan at the National Comprehensive University Conference is precisely a reflection of this change. Because everyone has changed, there is not much difference in principle for the new teaching plan proposed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, but when further discussing specialized courses, due to inconsistent understanding, there are disputes. Later, although it was unified, the degree of understanding was still different, which is still a question of the view of history. But everyone has progressed, and few people completely stand on the old position to look at the problem. Especially after exchanging opinions, inspiring each other, and helping each other, everyone's understanding has improved a step further. Chairman Mao's instruction in "Reform Our Study" that "For the modern Chinese history of the past hundred years, we should gather talents and cooperate to do it, and overcome the state of disorganization. We should first carry out analytical research in several departments of economic history, political history, military history, and cultural history, and then it is possible to carry out comprehensive research" is the most correct direction that everyone believes. Modern history of the past hundred years and first engaging in the research of specialized history are our bright road, and we must move in this direction.
    But this understanding is still preliminary for us. The key issue is still: study hard and constantly improve our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level to further transform our thinking. Because only in this way can we conduct historical scientific research in the correct direction, thereby improving our history teaching work.

    参加全国综合大学会议的点滴体会
    山东大学历史系主任　杨向奎
    九月间中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国综合大学会议，是一次适时的会议。解放四年来，在高等教育中曾进行了一系列的改革工作，这些改革工作的成绩是必须肯定的；但应该说，对于综合大学的根本问题，它的方针、任务和培养目标，以及综合大学的应有地位，还是模糊的。一种被模糊了方针任务的学校，在社会上不会引起重视，许多人感到它可有可无，也是自然的。从历年报考的学生人数，也可以看出这种现象，某一个综合大学今年只有十七个学生报考，最多的也不超过七百人。这次会议指出，综合大学应当是国家文化和科学发展的一个重要标志，然而社会上对它有这样不正确的认识，一般高中毕业学生不愿意投考，认为这是一种没有前途的学校，即使是在综合大学教书的某些教师，也不愿自己的子弟投考这类学校。
    以上的情形充分说明了目前综合大学还不是新中国文化和科学发展的一个重要标志，它远落在现实的后面，它不被社会上重视，这主要由于它本身的不够健全。从今年起，我国已进入有计划建设的新时期，这些问题是必须解决的，通过这次会议，也确实解决了这些问题，所以我说这是一个适时的会议。
    学校教育是一种上层建筑，是有阶级性的。资本主义国家的学校教育有其一套的办法，在旧中国半封建半殖民地时代，学校教育也有着一种不成套的拼凑办法，因为旧中国是半殖民地，是各个帝国主义侵略的对象，所以旧中国的学校教育制度是从各国拼凑起来的。曾先后抄袭过日本的、德国的、英国的、法国的、美国的教育制度，尤其是美帝国主义的教育制度给中国的恶劣影响最深。在解放前后，我国各大都市内还存在着各个帝国主义式的学校。在这些学校里，先生讲课用洋文，甚至讲中国史要用英文，更奇怪的是：作生物实验所用的蚯蚓都是美国货！当时如果说还有我们一套自己制度的话，那就是半封建制度与之结合了。这种现象在去年进行思想改造的时候，已暴露了很多。
    这种旧的教育制度是没法为新中国建设服务的，我们必须有适合于我们建设需要的教育制度，我们的教育制度必须是国家整体的一环，也就是说教育必须为国家总路线服务。这次主持会议的领导同志曾经强调了这一点，大家也明确认识了这一点。这应当是这次会议的基本收获之一。
    在这次会议上也讨论了各科教学计划，我参加的是历史专业小组，通过几次教学计划的讨论，我更明确地认识了专业教学的优越性以及历史学的阶级性。我认识到，在解放前中国的旧史学界，已经走上非常窄狭的道路。搜集史料工作和考订史料的工作当然有它一定的意义和价值，但这决不是历史学的全部，不能说除了史料工作再没有历史科学，可惜，过去许多人是这样想并且这样作，这不能不算是一种偏差。然而更大的错误是被历史偶然论的唯心史观支配着，表现在教学计划上，杂乱，无系统，对于历史没有一个整体观念，也没有一个历史发展的观念，注重古代史，轻视近代史和现代史。当然，我们不是说古代史不重要，但轻视近代史，“知古而不知今”是不对的。至于我们不注意社会历史的发展及其整体性，只作片段的研究，以断代史、帝王家谱为主要方面的研究，更是不正确的方向。事实上，解放前的旧史学界的出路越来越窄狭了，大家局促于一个小天地内打转转。
    由于以上的原因，所以在初解放时，旧的史学工作者曾经苦闷过一个时候，在大学里教书，旧的不能用了，而新的又没有建立起来，自己作研究工作也找不出一个正确方向。三四年来，各大学在党及政府领导下，进行了思想改造及有系统的马克思列宁主义的学习，于是史学界也有了显著的变化，分析批判旧的，努力学习新的；虽然这发展的情形尚有不同，但都有了改变。表现在全国综合大学会议上对于历史教学计划的争论，也正是这种改变的反映。因为大家都有了转变，所以对于中央人民政府高等教育部提出的新的教学方案，在原则上都没有什么出入，但当进一步讨论专门化的课程时，由于认识不一致，就有了争论；后来虽然也统一起来，然而认识的程度还是不同的，这仍然是对历史学的看法问题。但大家全进步了，很少有人完全站在旧的立场看问题，特别经过彼此交换意见，互相启发，互相帮助，彼此的认识全提高了一步。毛主席在“改造我们的学习”中的指示，“对于近百年的中国史，应聚集人材，分工合作地去做，克服无组织的状态。应先作经济史、政治史、军事史、文化史几个部门的分析的研究，然后才有可能作综合的研究”，是大家认为最正确的方向，近百年史及先从事于专门史的研究，是我们的光明大路，我们必须朝这方向走。
    但这种认识在我们来说还是初步的。关键的问题仍在于：努力学习，不断地提高我们的马克思列宁主义理论水平，进一步改造思想。因为只有这样，我们才有可能循着正确的方向进行历史科学研究，从而改进我们的历史教学工作。
