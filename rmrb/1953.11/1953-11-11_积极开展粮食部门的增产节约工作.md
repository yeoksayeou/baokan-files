Actively Carry Out Production Increase and Economy Practice in the Grain Sector
Xin Qi

Carrying out a production increase and economy movement in the state-owned grain sector, actively fulfilling and overfulfilling the state's grain procurement plan, and conserving grain are the current serious tasks of grain workers. Only when the state controls more grain and does a good job in grain supply can it further effectively stabilize prices, crack down on grain speculators and profiteers and exploiters who hoard goods for speculation, ensure the smooth progress of economic construction, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. In recent years, grain workers have made certain achievements in procurement, management, storage, and other work, but some grain workers have not paid close enough attention to procurement work, and they have not paid attention to conservation in grain management, resulting in great waste. These situations must be changed quickly.

What are the main requirements for carrying out the production increase and economy movement in the state-owned grain sector?

First, under the leadership of the local Party and government, vigorously carry out grain procurement work. In the next few months, it will be the peak season for grain procurement, and grain departments at all levels must organize forces to vigorously purchase grain. At present, some cadres in grain departments, seeing that a certain amount of grain has been received, believe that there is no problem with the procurement work, and there is a "relaxation" of thought, thus relaxing the procurement work. Some cadres in grain departments do not fully understand the arduousness and complexity of purchasing grain from the scattered small-peasant economy, do not closely cooperate with relevant departments, and do not actively carry out effective political and economic work. Seeing that the amount of grain purchased is not large, they have negative emotions of fear of difficulty, and therefore do not actively purchase grain. Some grain departments have also experienced problems such as disconnection in transportation, insufficient storage capacity, and lack of funds due to poor work deployment plans. For example, in Jiangxi Province, more than 30 counties were affected by the failure of transportation, and the 13th district of Nanchang County stopped receiving grain for as many as nine days. Therefore, all grain procurement workers should understand the great significance of grain procurement work and their important role in grain procurement work, highly display political enthusiasm, and do everything possible to do a good job in grain procurement. To this end, it is necessary to vigorously rely on cooperatives, investigate grain production, commodity volume, and farmers' self-use grain to have a clear understanding, overcome the emotions of "relaxation" and "fear of difficulty," strengthen the scheduling of storage capacity and funds, closely cooperate with relevant departments, fully do a good job in propaganda and education work for farmers and prepare the materials needed by farmers, and strive to actively fulfill and overfulfill the state's grain procurement plan.

Second, accelerate capital turnover and reduce circulation costs. Accelerating the capital turnover of grain departments lies in reducing the capital occupied by equipment and spare parts. According to statistics, this item of funds accounts for about 16 percent of the total commodity funds, among which the investment in the main packaging tool, gunny sacks, is quite considerable. If this fund is used to purchase steel rails, it can lay 1,810 kilometers of railway. If these gunny sacks are connected one by one, it is equal to 20 times the mileage of the railway from Manzhouli to Guangzhou. However, some grain departments have not paid due attention to the use and management of gunny sacks, and there are still arbitrary stockpiling and waste phenomena, which should be corrected in a timely manner. In reducing circulation costs, transportation costs should be reduced as much as possible. China has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation, and most of the grain storage is scattered in rural areas, so a large amount of scheduling is required. Therefore, transportation costs account for a very large proportion of commodity circulation costs (accounting for about 40 percent of commodity circulation costs). In the past, many "roundabout transportation" and "facing transportation" losses were caused by the blindness of grain transportation. At the same time, the adjustment of grain varieties in the market supply was not tightly controlled, which also increased transportation expenses. Therefore, on the one hand, grain departments must strengthen the accuracy of transportation plans and the balance of grain distribution to overcome the phenomenon of blind transportation; on the other hand, they should advocate eating what is available according to the local grain product situation to reduce grain scheduling and reduce transportation costs.

Third, save grain. First of all, we should start with improving the quality of processed grain, improving the grain finished product rate, reducing grain precision, safeguarding people's health, and saving grain. In recent years, the blind pursuit of refined white rice and flour in society has led to a year-by-year decline in the grain processing finished product rate. For example, in individual areas, the rice yield of medium-grade brown rice is as low as 59 jin, which is more than 30 jin less edible rice per dan than the "92 rice" standard promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on April 1, 1950, seriously wasting national grain. Moreover, the germ and bran in rice and flour have disappeared, greatly damaging the nutritional value of grain. At the same time, it must be pointed out that when improving the grain processing finished product rate, it is necessary to reduce harmful impurities such as husks, barnyard grass, buckwheat, sand, stones, and iron filings in the grain. Only in this way can we save more grain for the country and safeguard the health of the people. Second, reduce various grain losses. In the past three or four years, due to the continuous improvement of grain storage and transportation work, various grain losses have been decreasing year by year, but the loss rate is still very large, and some of these losses are due to preventable liability accidents. Therefore, in grain storage, we should effectively grasp the three links of cleaning and disinfecting warehouses before storage, paying attention to grain quality and storing in separate warehouses during storage, and diligent inspection and timely prevention after storage; in grain transportation, we should pay attention to close contact with relevant departments and strengthen escort work along the way. Only in this way can we strive to reduce losses and avoid the occurrence of liability accidents.

Now is the busy season for grain procurement. Grain departments at all levels must seize the time and, on the basis of overfulfilling the state's grain procurement plan, formulate specific production increase and economy plans and implement them. We firmly believe that with the correct leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, the active efforts of all grain cadres, and the support of the broad masses of the people, the production increase and economy work of the grain sector will surely proceed smoothly.

    积极开展粮食部门的增产节约工作
    辛　起
    在国营粮食部门开展增产节约运动，积极完成和超额完成国家粮食收购计划，节约粮食，这是粮食工作人员当前的严重任务。只有国家掌握了更多的粮食，做好粮食供应工作，才能进一步切实地稳定物价，打击粮食的投机奸商和囤积居奇的剥削者，保证经济建设的顺利进行，和工农联盟的进一步巩固。几年来，粮食工作人员对收购和经营保管等工作有一定的成绩，但也有些粮食工作人员对收购工作还抓得不紧，在粮食经营中也不注意节约，浪费很大，这些情况必须加以迅速改变。
    在国营粮食部门开展增产节约运动的主要要求是什么呢？
    首先是在当地党政领导下，大力做好粮食收购工作。在今后几个月内是粮食收购旺季，各级粮食部门必须组织力量，大力收购。目前有些粮食部门的干部看到已收到了一定数量的粮食，就认为收购工作已没有问题，存在“松劲”思想，因而放松了收购工作。也有些粮食部门干部对从分散的小农经济的农民手中购买粮食的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，不和有关部门密切配合，积极进行有效的政治工作和经济工作，看到粮食收购数量不大，就产生了畏难的消极情绪，因而不积极收购。也有些粮食部门由于工作部署计划不周，因此曾发生调运脱节、仓容不足、以及资金缺乏等现象，如江西省三十多个县因调运不及而影响了收购，其中南昌县十三区竟停收达九天。因此，全体粮食收购工作人员，应了解粮食收购工作的重大意义和自己对粮食收购工作的重要作用，高度发挥政治热情，尽一切可能把粮食收购工作做好。为此就必须大力依靠合作社，调查粮食产量、商品量及农民自用粮，做到心中有数，克服“松劲”“畏难”情绪，加强仓容与资金调度等工作，与各有关部门密切配合，充分做好对农民的宣传教育工作与准备农民所需要的物资，为积极完成和超额完成国家粮食收购计划而奋斗。
    再次，是加速资金周转和减低流转费用。粮食部门的加速资金周转，是在于减少装具备品所占用的资金。据统计，此项资金，占商品资金总数的百分之十六左右，其中主要包装工具麻袋的投资为数就相当可观，如果用这笔资金来购买钢轨，可以铺设一千八百一十公里长的铁路，如果把这些麻袋一条条连接起来，等于二十条从满洲里到广州铁路的里程，但有些粮食部门对麻袋的使用和管理没有引起应有的重视，还有任意积压和浪费的现象，这是应该及时纠正的。在减低流转费用中，应尽量减少运费。我国地区辽阔，交通不便，粮食的储存又大部分散在农村，故须大量调度，因此，运费在商品流通费中就占着极大的比重（占商品流通费约百分之四十）。以往常因粮食调运的盲目性，造成了不少“迂回运输”、“相向运输”等损失。同时，在市场供应粮种的调剂上，掌握不够严紧，这也加大了运费的开支。因此，一方面，粮食部门必须加强调运计划的准确性和粮食摆布的平衡性，以克服盲目调运的现象；另一方面，应根据当地粮产品种情况，提倡有啥吃啥，以减少粮食的调度，降低运输费用。
    第三，节约粮食。首先应从改善加工粮食质量着手，提高粮食成品率、降低粮食精度，维护人民健康并节约粮食。几年来，社会上盲目追求米、面的精白，致使粮食加工成品率逐年降低。如个别地区中等糙米出米率低到五十九斤，较中央人民政府政务院一九五○年四月一日颁布的“九二米”的规定标准每担少出食米三十斤以上，严重地浪费了国家粮食。而且米、面中的胚芽、糠麸消失殆尽，大大地损害了粮食的营养价值。同时须指出，在提高粮食加工成品率时，须减少粮食中的谷壳、稗子、荞子、砂、石、铁屑等有害杂质。只有这样，才能为国家节约更多的粮食与维护人民的健康。其次，是减少各种粮食损耗。三、四年来，由于粮食储运工作不断改进，各种粮食损耗已在逐年减少，但是损耗率还是很大，而且在这些损耗中还有若干属于可能避免的责任事故。因此，在粮食保管中应切实地掌握入库前进行清仓消毒、入库时注意粮食品质并分仓保管，入库后勤于检查及时防治等三个环节；在粮食调运中注意与有关部门密切联系和加强途中押运工作，只有这样，才能力求减少损耗和避免责任事故的发生。
    现在正是收购粮食的繁忙季节，各级粮食部门必须抓紧时间，要求在超额完成国家粮食收购计划的基础上，拟定具体的增产节约计划，并贯彻执行。我们深信：有各级党政机关的正确领导，全体粮食干部的积极努力，以及广大人民的支持，粮食部门的增产节约工作，一定能顺利进行。
