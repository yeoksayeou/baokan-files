    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Issues Instructions to Party Organizations Throughout the Province
    Vigorously Publicize the General Line for the Transition Period
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] To vigorously publicize the Party's general line for the transition period throughout the province, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on November 7, requiring Party organizations throughout the province to widely and deeply carry out the study and publicity campaign of the general line, in conjunction with the current grain purchase work and various urban and rural tasks.
    The instructions first require cadres and staff of organizations, systems, and departments at all levels to universally study the general line for the transition period. Leading comrades of Party committees at all levels should make reports on the general line to cadres at each level, and then organize everyone to read the main documents related to the general line and conduct discussions.
    The instructions emphasized: Party members of all grassroots Party branches throughout the province must, without exception, receive education on the Party's general line. The method of centralized training followed by regular education should be adopted. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee will compile teaching materials on the Party's general line for branches. At the county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings held in each county, in addition to conveying the general line, a brief transmission should also be given to the district committee members, organizers, township general branch secretaries, and part-time branch instructors who attend the meetings to enable them to be good branch instructors. After the meeting, the Party members and cadres in the working groups sent to the countryside will gather Party members and Youth League members to give centralized lectures on the teaching materials of the Party's general line for the transition period, taking the township general branch or village branch as the unit. Then, it will be transferred to regular education, and the branch instructor will be responsible for explaining each lesson and conducting discussions. In conjunction with the grain purchase work, erroneous ideas should be criticized and advanced ideas should be commended. Typical examples should be used to educate Party members at any time. Methods such as recalling and comparing can also be used to further improve the class consciousness of rural Party members.
    The instructions pointed out: On the basis of doing a good job in Party education and mobilization, all localities should take cadres at all levels and all Party members as the backbone to lead all Youth League members, propagandists, and the vast number of non-Party activists, as well as all propaganda forces, to form a strong propaganda team to vigorously publicize the general line and general task of the transition period to the masses, so that every household knows and everyone receives education. In rural areas, the general line and grain purchase work can be promoted through blackboard newspapers, broadcasting tubes, reading groups, winter schools, and other forms to educate peasants, so that peasants understand the principles of realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture; understand the benefits of taking the road of mutual assistance and cooperation; understand their contribution to national construction is to strive to increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, and in addition to the portion for self-consumption, sell the grain needed by the state to the state. The instructions require that all localities must pay attention to closely linking the vital interests and practical experiences of the peasants when publicizing the general line to the peasants.
    The instructions finally emphasized that Party committees at all levels must effectively strengthen the leadership of the publicity and education work of the Party's general line, make full preparations, formulate specific plans, and conduct timely inspections and summarize experiences.

    【本报讯】中共河北省委为了大张旗鼓地在全省宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，在十一月七日发出指示，要求全省党的组织，结合当前的购粮工作和城市、农村各项工作，广泛深入地开展总路线的学习和宣传运动。
    指示首先要求各级组织、各系统、各部门的干部和工作人员普遍学习过渡时期总路线。各级党委领导同志应逐级向干部作关于总路线的传达报告，然后组织大家阅读有关总路线的几个主要文件，进行讨论。
    指示中着重指出：对全省党的基层支部党员，要毫无例外地普遍进行党的总路线的教育。采取先集中训练而后转入经常教育的方法进行。由省委宣传部编写关于党的总路线的支部教材。在各县召开的县、区、乡三级干部会议上，除传达总路线外，还应对参加会议的区委、组织员、乡总支书记以及兼职支部教员进行简短传授，使他们当好支部教员。会后以乡总支或村支部为单位，由下乡工作组中的党员干部召集党员、团员集中讲授党在过渡时期总路线的教材。然后转入经常教育，由支部教员负责逐课讲解，进行讨论。并结合购粮工作，批判错误思想，表扬先进思想。随时用典型事例教育党员。还可运用回忆、对比等方法，把农村党员的阶级觉悟提高一步。
    指示指出：在做好党内教育和动员的基础上，各地应当以各级干部和全体党员为骨干，带动全体团员、宣传员和广大非党积极分子以及所有宣传力量，组成一支强大的宣传队伍，大张旗鼓地向群众宣传过渡时期的总路线总任务，做到家喻户晓，人人受到教育。在农村中可通过黑板报、广播筒以及读报组、冬学等形式，向农民进行总路线和购粮工作的宣传教育，使农民懂得实现社会主义工业化和对农业实现社会主义改造的道理；使农民懂得走互助合作的道路的好处；懂得自己对国家建设的贡献，就是努力增产粮食和其他农产品，并且除了自吃自用部分，要把国家所需要的粮食卖给国家。指示要求各地在对农民宣传总路线时，必须注意密切联系农民的切身利益和实际体验。
    指示最后强调指出：各级党委必须切实加强对党的总路线的宣传教育工作的领导，做好充分准备，订出具体计划，并适时检查，总结经验。
