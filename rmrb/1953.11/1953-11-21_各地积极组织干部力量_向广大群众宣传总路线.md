Xinhua News Agency reports: Various localities have universally organized cadres to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period and have begun large-scale publicity and education work on the general line for the people.

In Shanghai, as of the 18th, about 400,000 people, including state organ cadres, workers, shop assistants, industrialists and businessmen, cultural and educational workers, PLA troops stationed in Shanghai, and neighborhood residents, had heard reports on the state's general line during the transition period. Currently, the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee are continuing to hold large-scale cadre report meetings. More than 3,000 reporters and temporary reporters have been dispatched throughout the city to give reports to the broad masses. The vast numbers of cadres and masses in Shanghai were inspired by the bright future of the motherland after listening to the reports. Many government workers requested to strengthen their studies and improve their work efficiency. After studying the issue of national industrialization, workers generally recognized the significance of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Many professors felt the importance and glory of the task of training construction cadres for the country after listening to the reports.机关干部、高等学校教职员、民主人士、宗教界人士、少数民族代表及工商界人士等已先后开始学习国家总路线。 Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City’s government cadres, university faculty, democratic figures, religious figures, minority representatives and businessmen have all successively started studying the state's general line. In order to enable this study to be carried out more extensively and deeply, Zhejiang Province is preparing to launch a huge socialist propaganda campaign throughout the province from November to January next year. The Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CCP has drafted a specific plan for carrying out this movement, requiring that this propaganda and study become a huge force to promote all work. Currently, various special districts and counties in the province are convening party member meetings or cadre meetings to convey the general line and general task of the transition period. A large number of cadres from provincial-level organs have gone to the countryside to help various localities carry out propaganda. Anhui Province's provincial-level organs have begun to link their studies to the work of various business departments, using the state's general line during the transition period as a guiding light for deploying and summarizing work. The province's Water Conservancy Bureau plans to send cadres to the larger construction sites that will begin this winter and next spring to educate the migrant workers on the general line and general task, and to send working groups to investigate and summarize the experience of promoting the collectivization of farmers in the use and management of ponds and dams due to the development of farmland water conservancy. The commercial departments focused on the issue of how to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance through state-owned commerce. Many units in the cultural and educational systems have formulated publicity plans on how to implement the general line among the masses.

After the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued instructions on organizing all party cadres to study the general line on October 4, it convened a symposium on theoretical education of various provinces and cities on October 26 to specifically discuss and arrange the measures and methods for studying the general line, and determined to combine this study with theoretical education. Lin Feng, First Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, instructed at the meeting the importance, purpose and requirements of studying the general line and general task during the transition period, and proposed that from November this year to January next year, a high tide of studying the general line and general task should be formed from top to bottom. At present, most of the on-the-job cadres in organs at the Northeast level and in various provinces and cities are studying the state's general line and general task during the transition period according to the organization of theoretical study, among which the number of people participating in the study in senior and intermediate groups has reached more than 50,000. The Dalian Municipal Committee of the CCP convened a city-wide cadre meeting and a propaganda cadre meeting to mobilize cadres at all levels to study the general line. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CCP deployed the study of the general line at meetings of party member cadres, cities, counties, and factory and mine cadres in early October, and started to focus on helping the study in several regions. Now, in addition to studying according to regulations, cadres in high, middle, and elementary groups throughout the province, cadres in cultural classes are also participating in the study of the general line. Cadres of organs directly under Jilin Province and cadres of middle and elementary groups in Jilin City and those participating in cultural studies use wired broadcasting to listen to lectures. The number of people listening directly each time reaches more than 14,000.

The Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued a notice on October 31, stipulating that the CCP committees of each province and city must personally lead this study, and the propaganda departments of the CCP committees should specifically formulate feasible study plans, promptly check the study situation, collect problems occurring in the study, organize necessary answer reports, etc., to ensure the successful completion of this study. The Committees of Organs Directly under the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and the Committees of Organs of the Northwest Administrative Committee of the CCP have formulated study plans for organ cadres based on this notice. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CCP convened an enlarged meeting on November 3 to discuss and deploy this study. Now, the senior and intermediate group cadres in Xi'an City who are participating in theoretical study have officially begun to study. Cadres in the suburban districts of the city will begin to concentrate for seven to ten days from the 20th to conduct studies, and then conduct extensive propaganda to the peasants in the suburbs. The Xi'an People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee is also currently formulating plans to actively deploy the study of the business community.

More than 100,000 cadres from county-level and above organs in Sichuan Province are participating in this study. So far, various organs have completed the report on the state's general line and general task during the transition period and are about to begin discussions. The reporters of Sichuan Province and Chengdu City have begun to carry out publicity work.
