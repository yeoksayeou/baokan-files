    (I) State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives Should Closely Integrate
    Wang Huiping

    Today, this newspaper publishes articles regarding the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in market purchasing and sales activities in Fengcheng, Liaodong, and Echeng, Hubei. These articles illustrate two types of interrelationships between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. The Fengcheng County Department Store closely relies on the cooperative's commercial network in rural areas to expand the sales of industrial products, consolidate and strengthen the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market, and also enhance the cooperative's prestige among the masses and promote business development. This approach is correct and in line with the requirements of the Party's commercial policy. State-owned commercial units in various regions should seriously learn from the experience of Fengcheng Department Store in closely integrating with cooperatives, strengthen and improve their work in this regard, and correctly implement policies. The Echeng County state-owned commerce and cooperatives, in order to simply pursue profits, mutually exclude each other. As a result, they cannot meet the supply and marketing needs of farmers, giving private commercial speculation an opportunity, creating market chaos, and benefiting the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas. This approach is obviously wrong and violates the Party's commercial policy.

    Supporting cooperatives is one of the basic tasks of state-owned commerce. State-owned commerce must be closely integrated with supply and marketing cooperatives; cooperative commerce must accept the leadership of state commercial agencies. This is an important part of the Party's commercial policy. Over the past few years, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have basically followed this policy and have developed many good experiences like those of Fengcheng Department Store. As a result, both state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have developed rapidly. In 1952, agricultural products purchased by cooperative commerce on behalf of state-owned commerce accounted for 43% of the total agricultural product purchases of state-owned commerce, with major agricultural products accounting for 62.2%. Goods sold by state-owned commerce on behalf of cooperative commerce (excluding grain) accounted for 52.49% of the total commodity sales of cooperative commerce. The preferential treatment that cooperative commerce received from state-owned commerce last year exceeded 900 billion yuan. Because cooperative commerce has played its role as a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce, we have now established a new type of trade network from cities to villages that is initially taking shape. State-owned commerce has also gained a dominant leading position in the domestic market. In wholesale trade, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce account for more than 50% of the total value of social commodities; in retail trade, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce account for 32% of the total social commodity retail circulation. In conjunction with correct measures in all aspects of financial and economic work, this has heavily cracked down on speculative activities in the market, stabilized prices, and enlivened the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, creating favorable conditions for the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production. In particular, through the supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas, more than 100 million scattered individual farmers have been organized, economic ties have been established with the state-owned economy, the exploitation of capitalist commerce has been avoided and reduced, and farmers have been given collectivist ideological education, thereby consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    However, it is undeniable that, on the other hand, there are still many uncoordinated and chaotic phenomena in the market activities of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. If these phenomena are not corrected, they will inevitably hinder state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce from jointly serving production and consumers, enlivening the urban and rural economy, and promoting the further development of industrial and agricultural production, that is, hindering the implementation of the Party's general line in this regard.

    There are many reasons for this uncoordinated phenomenon, one of the most important of which is that the policy education of cadres by the leading organs of state-owned commerce at all levels is insufficient. Many state-owned commerce cadres still have muddled ideas about the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. Some people believe that state-owned commerce has strong capital and abundant materials, and there is no need to support cooperatives; others believe that entrusting cooperatives to purchase and sell on their behalf requires handling fees and preferential treatment, which is not cost-effective and troublesome, and they believe that this will hinder the completion of their own plans, and so on. Therefore, they do not actively support cooperatives and even impose some wrong restrictions on them, making the treatment of cooperative commerce in market conditions worse than that of private merchants, affecting the development of cooperative commerce.

    These views are obviously wrong. They only know that state-owned commerce must complete its own purchasing and sales tasks, but they do not know that state-owned commerce must rely on supply and marketing cooperatives to complete its tasks. Supply and marketing cooperatives have developed rapidly in recent years. They have 32,000 primary-level cooperatives, more than 97,000 retail outlets, and more than 100 million members. They have become an important part of the national economy and have played and will continue to play a significant active role in stabilizing prices and fighting against capitalist commercial speculation. If state-owned commerce does not actively utilize the role of cooperative commerce and ignores or underestimates the vast commercial network of cooperative commerce in rural areas, it is equivalent to abandoning the vast rural market. Without relying on the vast rural market, the purchasing and sales tasks of state-owned commerce cannot be completed well.

    Furthermore, after our country achieved revolutionary victory, in order to strive for the victory of national economic construction, we must continue to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Supply and marketing cooperatives are one of the most powerful tools for strengthening the worker-peasant alliance from an economic perspective. Because organizing the commodity exchange of industrial and agricultural products through supply and marketing cooperatives can most widely connect farmers and is most easily accepted by farmers. Lenin once said that cooperatives are a good ladder for combining the private interests and collective interests of farmers. Therefore, state-owned commerce can only closely integrate with cooperative commerce and actively lead the activities of cooperative commerce. Through this activity, the vast individual economies can be organized to jointly fight against the speculative behavior of private capitalist commerce and the spontaneous capitalist forces. Only in this way can the connection between industry and agriculture be established and developed, the urban and rural economy be enlivened; can the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts be gradually realized, and the individual economy of the working people be led to gradually move towards collectivization; can the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance be strengthened and the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated.

    Therefore, the leadership of state-owned commercial leading organs over supply and marketing cooperatives is essentially the concrete realization of the leadership of the working class over the peasants, the leadership of industry over agriculture, and the leadership of the city over the countryside in the commercial field. Some cadres in the state-owned commercial system lack sufficient understanding of this point, and simply argue about the amount of profit, and even exclude and restrict the development of cooperative economy, which is essentially a manifestation of bourgeois management thinking.

    Of course, on the part of cooperative commercial workers, it must also be recognized that cooperatives can only seek the development of their own business and organize the thousands of scattered individual farmer economies and handicraft economies to gradually embark on the road of large-scale collective production if they accept the leadership and support of state-owned commerce. Some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives also lack sufficient understanding of this point. They do not respect the leadership of state-owned commerce enough and do not cooperate closely enough with state-owned commerce. Therefore, they have not met the supply and marketing needs of farmers that could have been met, causing dissatisfaction among farmers, affecting the development of their own business, and benefiting the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas.

    In order to further strengthen the close integration of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, an inspection should be carried out within the two systems of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, in order to clarify the interrelationship between the two economies ideologically and politically, overcome all past erroneous thoughts and practices that restricted the development of cooperative economy and disrespected the leadership of state-owned commerce, and replace them with the positive and active thoughts and practices of unity and mutual assistance, common development, and close integration.

    In terms of specific business, the following issues must be resolved currently: First, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must achieve consistency in planning. When formulating plans, state-owned commerce should make proper arrangements for state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and private commerce. The plan of the supply and marketing cooperative should become an important part of the plan of state-owned commerce, and under the leadership of the financial committees at all levels, it should be connected and balanced with the plan of state-owned commerce at each level to avoid duplication and confusion. Second, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should gradually realize the principle of urban-rural division of labor. In cities and industrial and mining areas where state-owned commerce already exists, cooperatives generally no longer develop, and state-owned commerce is responsible for operating them in a planned way. The main position of cooperative commerce should be placed in rural areas and small towns. Third, state-owned commerce must resolutely implement the preferential policy for cooperative commerce. Cooperatives should be given a discount on the listed price of state-owned companies when purchasing daily necessities for their members from state-owned companies, and goods suitable for the needs of cooperative commerce should be supplied preferentially as much as possible; if cooperative commerce cannot purchase goods from state-owned companies in time to meet the needs of members due to insufficient funds, state-owned companies should provide a certain amount of short-term credit sales (but the payment for goods should be cleared in time); state-owned commerce must notify cooperative commerce in time when adjusting prices, and in terms of market prices, cooperative commerce must also obey the leadership of state-owned prices; state-owned commerce should provide assistance at any time in terms of business technology. Fourth, state-owned commerce must give reasonable handling fees for the goods purchased and sold by cooperative commerce on its behalf, and stipulate reasonable loss rates, so that cooperative commerce can have a certain profit accumulation under reasonable management. Cooperative commerce must first meet the needs of the state, and should strive to improve business management, save expenses, and reduce the state's purchase costs as much as possible.

    Now is the busiest season for rural purchases and sales. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must complete and overfulfill this year's purchase and sales tasks. Therefore, strengthening the integration of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is not only a state policy, but also an urgent task for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce.

    （一）国营商业和合作社应该密切结合
    王惠平
    今天本报发表的辽东凤城、湖北鄂城国营商业与合作社商业在市场购销活动中的关系，说明了当前国营商业和合作社商业在相互关系上的两种类型。凤城县百货公司紧紧地依靠合作社在农村的商业网，扩大了工业品推销，巩固并壮大了国营商业对市场的领导作用，也使合作社在群众中的威信提高，业务发展。这种做法是正确的，是符合党的商业政策的要求的。各地国营商业单位应认真学习凤城百货公司和合作社密切结合的经验，加强与改进这一方面的工作，正确贯彻政策。鄂城县国营商业与合作社为了单纯追求盈利，互相排斥，结果，不能满足农民的供销要求，给私营商业的投机活动以可乘之机，造成市场混乱，有利于农村资本主义自发势力的发展。这种做法显然是错误的，是违反了党的商业政策的。
    扶助合作社是国营商业的基本任务之一。国营商业必须和供销合作社紧密结合；合作社商业必须接受国家商业机关的领导。这是党的商业政策的一个重要部分。几年来，国营商业和合作社商业基本上遵照这个政策进行工作，并已出现了很多像凤城百货公司那样比较好的经验，所以国营商业和合作社商业的业务都有迅速地发展。一九五二年，合作社商业为国营商业代购的农产品，已占国营商业农产品收购总量的百分之四十三，其中主要农产品已占百分之六十二点二，国营商业委托合作社商业代销的商品（不包括粮食），已占合作社商业商品推销总量的百分之五十二点四九；合作社商业去年自国营商业获得的优待金额已超过九千亿元。由于合作社商业发挥了其作为国营商业的有力助手的作用，目前我们已经建立了一个初具规模的由城市到乡村的新型贸易网，国营商业在国内市场上也已取得了优势的领导地位。在批发贸易方面，国营商业与合作社商业已占社会商品总值的百分之五十以上；在零售贸易方面，国营商业与合作社商业已占社会商品零售流通总值的百分之三十二。再配合以财政经济工作各方面的正确措施，沉重地打击了市场上的投机活动，稳定了物价，活跃了城乡内外物资交流，为工农业生产的恢复与发展创造了有利条件。特别是通过农村中的供销合作社，已把一亿以上的分散的个体农民组织起来，与国营经济建立了经济上的联系，避免和减少了资本主义商业的剥削，并给了农民以集体主义的思想教育，从而巩固了工农联盟。
    但是，不可否认，在另一方面，国营商业与合作社商业在市场活动中，还存在着许多不协调的混乱现象。这种现象如不加以纠正，必将妨碍国营商业和合作社商业共同为生产和消费者服务、活跃城乡经济、促进工农业生产的进一步发展，也就是妨害国家总路线在这一方面的贯彻。
    产生这种不协调现象的原因很多，其中最主要的一个原因，是由于国营商业各级领导机关平时对干部进行政策教育不够。不少国营商业干部对国营商业和合作社商业的关系还有着糊涂思想。有些人认为国营商业资金雄厚，物资充沛，扶持合作社没有必要；还有些人认为委托合作社代购代销，就得给手续费、优待金，不合算，又麻烦，并且认为这样就会妨碍本身计划的完成等等；因而，对合作社就不积极扶持，甚至加以若干错误的限制，使合作社商业在市场条件的待遇上反不如私商，影响了合作社商业的发展。
    这些看法显然是错误的。他们只知道国营商业要完成自己的购销任务，却不知道国营商业要完成自己的任务，就非依靠供销合作社不可的道理。供销合作社几年来已有迅速的发展，它拥有三万二千个基层社，九万七千多个零售点，一亿以上的社员，已成为国民经济中一个重要组成部分，在稳定物价上，在与资本主义商业投机行为作斗争中，都起了并将继续起着相当大的积极作用。国营商业如果不积极发挥合作社商业的作用，忽视或轻视合作社商业在农村中的广大的商业网，就等于放弃广大的农村市场，而不依靠广大的农村市场，国营商业的供销任务就都不能很好地完成。
    再说，我们的国家在取得革命胜利后，为了争取国家经济建设的胜利，必须继续巩固工农联盟，供销合作社便是从经济方面加强工农联盟的最有力的工具之一。因为通过供销合作社，组织工农业产品的商品交换，最能普遍联系农民，并且最易为农民接受。列宁曾经说过：合作社是很好的将农民的私人利益和集体利益结合起来的阶梯。因此，国营商业只有与合作社商业紧密结合起来，并积极地领导合作社商业的活动，通过这种活动，把广大的个体经济组织起来，共同去和私人资本主义商业的投机行为斗争，同自发的资本主义势力斗争；只有这样，才能建立和发展工农业的联系，活跃城乡经济；才能对农业、手工业逐步实现社会主义改造，领导劳动人民的个体经济逐步地走向集体化；才能加强工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用和巩固工农联盟。
    因此，国营商业领导机关对供销合作社的领导，实质上就是在商业领域中具体实现工人阶级对农民的领导，工业对农业的领导，城市对乡村的领导。国营商业系统的若干干部对这点缺乏足够的认识，单纯地争执利润多少，以至排斥与限制合作社经济发展，这在本质上就是资产阶级经营思想的表现。
    当然，在合作社商业工作者方面，也必须认识到合作社只有接受国营商业的领导和扶持，才能求得本身业务的发展，才能把千千万万的分散的个体的农民经济和手工业经济组织起来，使他们逐步走上大规模集体生产的道路。有些供销合作社干部对这一点的认识也是不够的，他们对国营商业的领导不够尊重，同国营商业的配合不够密切。因而，对农民的供销要求，本来可以满足的没有满足，引起了农民的不满，影响了自己业务的发展，并且有利于农村资本主义自发势力的发展。
    为了进一步加强国营商业和合作社商业的密切结合，在国营商业与合作社商业两个系统内，必须进行一次检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，以期从思想上、政治上明确两种经济的相互关系，克服过去一切限制合作社经济发展、与不尊重国营商业领导的错误的思想和作风，而代之以团结互助、共同发展、紧密结合的积极的主动的思想和作风。
    在具体业务上，当前必须解决以下几个问题：首先，国营商业与合作社商业必须取得计划的一致，国营商业在制定计划时，应对国营商业、合作社商业以及私营商业进行妥善安排。供销合作社的计划，应当成为国营商业计划的一个重要的组成部分，在各级财委领导下，与国营商业计划逐级衔接平衡，避免重复和混乱现象。其次，国营商业与合作社商业应逐步实现城乡分工的原则。在已有国营商业的城市与工矿区，合作社一般不再发展，并有计划地逐步地改由国营商业负责经营，合作社商业主要的阵地应放在农村与小城镇。第三，国营商业要坚决贯彻对合作社商业的优待政策。合作社向国营公司购进社员日常生活必需品，应按国营公司出售牌价给予折扣优待，凡适合于合作社商业需要的商品应尽可能优先供应；如合作社商业因资金不足，而不能及时向国营公司进货以满足社员需要时，国营公司应给予一定数量的短期赊销（但应及时清理货款）；国营商业调整价格时，必须及时通知合作社商业，在市场价格上，合作社商业也必须服从国家牌价的领导；在业务技术上，国营商业应随时给予帮助。第四，国营商业委托合作社商业代购代销的商品，必须给予合理的手续费用，并规定合理的损耗率，使合作社商业在合理经营下能有一定的利润积累，合作社商业必须首先供应国家的需要，并应力求改进经营管理，节省费用，尽可能降低国家的收购成本。
    现在正是农村购销最繁忙的时节，国营商业与合作社商业必须完成并超额完成今年的购销任务，因此，加强国营商业与合作社商业的结合，不仅是国家既定的政策方针问题，而是国营商业和合作社商业当前迫切的任务。
