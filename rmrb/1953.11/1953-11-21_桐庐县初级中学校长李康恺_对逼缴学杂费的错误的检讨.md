    Li Kangkai, principal of Tonglu County Junior High School, Zhejiang Province, Self-Criticism of the Mistake of Forcibly Collecting Tuition and Fees
    Li Kangkai, principal of Tonglu County Junior High School in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, wrote: I sincerely accept the reader's criticism of me in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on August 6. I used the method of not allowing students to participate in semester exams to force students to pay tuition and fees, which has a destructive effect on the physical and mental health of students, seriously violates the educational policy, and has caused a very bad influence. I usually lack ideological education for students, and I have not made students realize that abiding by school regulations and paying tuition and fees on time is their due obligation; but at the end of the semester, because a lot of tuition and fees have not been collected, I resort to all means to urge payment. This is completely wrong. In the future, I am determined to study hard, improve my policy and ideological level, ensure that similar situations are prevented from happening, and better complete the educational tasks assigned to me by the state.

    桐庐县初级中学校长李康恺对逼缴学杂费的错误的检讨
    浙江省桐庐县初级中学校长李康恺来信：我诚恳接受八月六日“读者来信摘要”栏中读者对我的批评。我采用不准参加学期考试的办法来逼迫学生缴清学杂费，这对学生的身心健康起着摧残的作用，严重地违反了教育方针，并且造成了很坏的影响。我平时对学生缺乏思想教育，没有使学生认识遵守学校规定按期缴清学杂费是自己应尽的义务；而到了学期结束时因为还有不少学杂费没收齐，就不择手段地来进行催缴。这是完全错误的。今后我决定努力学习，提高政策、思想水平，保证防止类似情况发生，并更好地完成国家交给我的教育任务。
