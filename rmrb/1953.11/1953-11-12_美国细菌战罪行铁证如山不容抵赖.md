    The heinous crimes of the American aggressors in waging germ warfare against Korea and our country during the Korean War have long been established with conclusive evidence and are absolutely undeniable and unexcusable. The confessions of 19 people, including U.S. Air Force Colonels Andrew J. Evans Jr. and Walker M. Mahurin, once again powerfully and systematically expose the dark secrets of the U.S. aggressors' large-scale germ warfare, and deliver an irresistible and heavy blow to the U.S.'s recent activities in the Political Committee of the Eighth UN General Assembly aimed at concealing the crimes of U.S. troops using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    In the confessions of the nineteen American Air Force prisoners of war, especially those of Mahurin and Evans, it can be seen more systematically that the large-scale germ warfare launched by the American aggressors in the Korean War was planned and carried out under the direct command of the highest U.S. military authorities. According to the confessions of Mahurin and Evans, as early as the autumn of 1950, the American aggressors were actively preparing to use bacteriological weapons in Korea. At that time, the Chinese People's Volunteers were going abroad to cooperate with the Korean People's Army in combat, and the American invading army was suffering repeated defeats. The Joint Chiefs of Staff hoped to use bacteriological weapons to save the failing prospects of the Korean War. The then Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, Army Chief of Staff Collins, and Naval Operations Director Sherman all believed that bacteriological weapons were effective and cheap, should be developed, and actively formulated plans for the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and preparations for them. This plan was required to be completed by the end of 1951. The decision and plan for the American invading army to launch germ warfare in Korea in the winter of 1951 was made by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. This decision was issued to General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command in Tokyo, via secret orders from Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, and relayed to General Everest, Commander of the Fifth Air Force in Korea, for execution. In November 1952, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg personally came to Korea to inspect the effectiveness of the germ warfare. Because of their positions, Mahurin and Evans knew the facts of this highly confidential germ warfare plan and their testimony is completely credible. The American aggressors directly commanded and committed the heinous crime of germ warfare, but now they are trying to cover it up and deny it at the UN General Assembly, which proves how cowardly and shameless they are.

    From the confessions of Mahurin and others, it can be seen that the American aggressors had great ambitions for the use of bacteriological weapons. The scope of its use became larger and larger, not only in Korea, but also in various parts of Northeast China, where a large number of bacteria-carrying insects were successively scattered. Between June and July of 1952, germ warfare reached its climax, with all units of the Fifth Air Force participating in this crime. All of the U.S. Air Force in the Korean theater made germ warfare one of their training subjects. The main purpose of the U.S. expansion of germ warfare was to cut off the supply lines of the front-line Korean and Chinese People's troops, infect our transportation lines and supply areas with bacteria, making it impossible to carry out logistical support, and to transmit bacterial toxins to our front-line positions through supplies, paralyzing our military's combat capabilities. However, because our army had strong tunnel fortifications, although the American invading army had long used a large number of bacteriological bombs at the front, it had no effect. According to the plans of the American aggressors, as long as the personnel and supplies going from our rear to the front were infected with poisonous bacteria, the poisonous bacteria could be brought into the tunnel fortifications. Therefore, the focus of the American germ warfare was placed on our main transportation lines, cooperating with the so-called "air strangulation war" being conducted by the U.S. military at that time, threatening the connection between our army's front and rear, and attempting to influence the ongoing armistice negotiations at that time, increasing pressure on the Korean and Chinese sides, and obtaining what it hoped to obtain on the battlefield and at the negotiating table but could not. The confessions of Mahurin and others prove that the intention of the American aggressors to carry out germ warfare is completely consistent with the overall strategic intention it showed at that time on the battlefield and at the armistice negotiations. This irrefutably proves that the crime of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare cannot be denied by the likes of Lodge and Mayo at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly with empty words.

    Like the confessions of U.S. Air Force Colonel Schwable and others that have been published before, many of the facts in the confessions of Mahurin and others corroborate each other. Although they belong to different units and were captured and confessed at different times, they spoke so exhaustively, clearly, and reasonably about the complicated details and technical processes of the U.S. launching germ warfare, that it would have been absolutely impossible to say it if they had not personally participated in the crime of germ warfare. For example, regarding the time when the United States carried out germ warfare in Korea, Schwable said: "The overall plan for germ warfare in Korea was instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951." The order was issued through Ridgway and Weyland. This is completely consistent with the statements in the confessions of Mahurin, Evans, and others. Evans relayed the words of Brigadier General Warburton of the Fifth Air Force rear command, saying: "The Fifth Air Force's germ warfare activities began with the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951, that is: to use the weapons that the Air Force had already developed at that time for testing." "After these tests were successful, the germ warfare plan was officially approved in December 1951." The time they mentioned is consistent with what Bray, O'Neill, Mahurin, and others said. All twenty-five American Air Force prisoners of war who participated in germ warfare mentioned in their confessions that they had all heard about germ warfare courses before and after the United States began launching large-scale germ warfare in Korea. Although the time and place they attended the classes were different, the content of the courses was largely the same. These American Air Force prisoners of war also agreed on the types of American aircraft that participated in the germ warfare, the types of bacteriological weapons, the methods of carrying out bacteriological operations, and the time when various types of aircraft and bacteriological weapons were actually used in germ warfare. In particular, regarding the issue of "secrecy," all prisoners of war mentioned that the U.S. military authorities emphasized "secrecy" the most throughout the entire process of carrying out germ warfare. Every time they attended classes or carried out germ warfare missions, they were strictly warned not to disclose anything about germ warfare, and even Air Force personnel were absolutely forbidden to talk about it with each other. Bacteriological weapons and germ warfare missions were all carried out using code names and code words. They were all warned that if there was any leakage of secrets, they would be punished by military law. All these mutually corroborated and complementary facts prove that the germ warfare carried out by the American aggressors was carefully planned over a long period of time and had thorough arrangements. The attempt of the American aggressors to deny the crime of germ warfare is futile.

    Recently, the United States submitted a so-called "fair investigation of the accusations of the use of bacteriological weapons by the United Nations forces" at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, forcing the Political Committee to conduct discussions; and U.S. representative Mayo submitted so-called "affidavits," fabricating retractions by those American Air Force prisoners of war who had been released by the Korean and Chinese sides, in order to confuse world opinion and cover up the crimes of the United States using bacteriological weapons in the Korean War. However, the American aggressors are wasting their efforts. No matter how cunningly it denies the crime of germ warfare, it will never be able to overturn the confessions of Schwable, Mahurin, and other twenty-five people in our possession. Because these confessions were voluntarily made by U.S. Air Force prisoners of war under the influence of the lenient treatment policy of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, and their consciences were condemned for the crimes of germ warfare they had committed, these confessions are so true and corroborate each other. U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Richard G. Was clearly explained in his confession the inner process of confessing the crime of germ warfare, saying: "The Chinese have proven that they are my friends," "What I can give them in return is repentance and truth," "I have exposed the evil actions of my government in throwing bacteriological bombs. Only when I have regarded the former enemy as a friend will I expose this vile act." The authenticity of the confessions of germ warfare crimes made by American prisoners of war under these circumstances is absolutely unquestionable, and it is also absolutely impossible for the American aggressors to overturn them. Facts have proved that although the American aggressors categorically deny the crime of germ warfare and falsely accuse the confessions of Schwable and others as being made under the "torture" of the Korean and Chinese sides, the American aggressors can only limit themselves to empty accusations, and cannot overturn or deny even half of the various major facts of the United States carrying out germ warfare. On the contrary, the so-called "affidavits" fabricated by the U.S. government under the coercion of "courts-martial" and "charges of treason" against these prisoners of war who have been released and repatriated are so absurd and ridiculous that even Quinn was said to have been locked up in a "cold cave" by the Korean and Chinese sides while still teaching in the United States. Who can believe such nonsense!

    As everyone knows, germ warfare is the most brutal and barbaric method of warfare that violates human morality and destroys the principles of international law and international conventions. Schwable, Mahurin, and other twenty-five people who participated in the brutal crime of germ warfare launched by the United States in Korea should have been severely punished; however, the Korean People's Army believed that they were not the main people responsible for planning and launching germ warfare in Korea, and they were able to confess their crimes and expose the many inside stories of the American aggressors carrying out germ warfare after committing the crime. Therefore, according to our consistent lenient policy towards prisoners of war, they were all released during the period of direct exchange of prisoners of war after the armistice. However, now that they have returned to the United States, people have doubts about their safety. Johnsen, the Archbishop of Canterbury in England, also asked: "Have they been sent to the Foggy Bottom mental hospital along with others, and are they undergoing brainwashing treatment under the thoughtful care of McCarthy's psychiatrists? Why not let these unfortunate people speak?" American news agencies revealed that Schwable and others may be subjected to "courts-martial." Does this approach of the U.S. government towards its own released and repatriated prisoners of war not prove that its crimes of germ warfare are trying to cover up?

    The United States absolutely cannot cover up its crime of carrying out germ warfare in Korea, and it has been proved in many other issues. While the U.S. government is denying the crime of carrying out germ warfare at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, falsely accusing the accusations of germ warfare by the Korean and Chinese sides as being false, and claiming to conduct a so-called "fair investigation"; at the same time, it unreasonably prevents the Korean and Chinese representatives from attending the UN General Assembly to discuss the issue of germ warfare, and refuses to discuss the Soviet proposal at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, that is: to require all those countries that have not yet signed or approved the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, to sign or approve this protocol in the shortest possible time. Does the fact that the United States is so afraid to allow Korean and Chinese representatives to attend the UN General Assembly, and that it disregards the unanimous demands of the people of the world and refuses to ratify the Geneva Protocol, not prove its criminal psychology of carrying out germ warfare?

    The U.S. crime against humanity of carrying out germ warfare in the Korean War is irrefutable and cannot be denied in any way. In addition to the many facts mentioned above being proved, many international justice figures, especially the International Scientific Commission composed of well-known scientists from various countries and the investigation team composed of legal scholars from various countries, have irrefutably confirmed this serious crime of the United States after conducting on-the-spot investigations of various evidence. Just as the United States is trying to whitewash its crimes at the UN General Assembly, the statement issued by Johnsen, the Archbishop of Canterbury in England, represents the answer from the world's righteous people. Johnsen said: "In my opinion, there is nothing unclear. I firmly believe that the American army carried out germ warfare in North Korea and China."

    美国细菌战罪行铁证如山不容抵赖
    美国侵略者在侵朝战争期间，对朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的万恶罪行，早已证据确凿大白于世，是绝对不可能推卸和狡赖的了。美国空军上校小安德烈·杰·爱文斯、瓦克·麦·马胡林等十九人的供词，再次有力地系统地揭穿了美国侵略者发动大规模细菌战的黑暗内幕，并对美国最近在第八届联合国大会政治委员会上进行的以掩盖美国军队曾在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪行为目的的活动，予以无可抗拒的沉重打击。
    十九名美国空军战俘的供词中，特别是马胡林和爱文斯的供词中，可以更系统地看到，美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中发动的大规模细菌战，是在美国最高军事当局直接指挥下有计划地进行的。据马胡林和爱文斯的供词说，还在一九五○年秋，美国侵略者便在积极准备在朝鲜使用细菌武器了。当时正是中国人民志愿军出国协同朝鲜人民军作战，美国侵略军接连吃败仗的时候，参谋长联席会议希望使用细菌武器来挽救侵朝战争失败的前途。当时的美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、空军参谋长范顿伯、陆军参谋长柯林斯和海军作战部长薛尔曼，都认为细菌武器有效而便宜，应加以发展，并积极拟定在朝鲜使用细菌武器及其准备工作的计划。这个计划限令在一九五一年年底完成。一九五一年冬天美国侵略军在朝鲜发动细菌战的决定和计划，就是美国参谋长联席会议作出的。这个决定是通过空军参谋长范顿伯用密令发给东京远东美军总司令李奇微，经过远东空军司令威兰转发给在朝鲜的第五航空队司令埃弗雷斯特执行的。一九五二年十一月，美国空军参谋长范顿伯还曾亲自到朝鲜来视察过一次细菌战的效果。马胡林和爱文斯由于他们职位的关系，知道这种高度机密性的细菌战计划的事实，是完全可以相信的。美国侵略者直接指挥干下了细菌战的滔天罪行，现在却企图在联合国大会上进行掩盖和狡赖，证明他们是何等的卑怯与厚颜无耻。
    从马胡林等十九个人的供词中可以看出，美国侵略者对于使用细菌武器是抱着很大的野心的。它使用的范围愈来愈大，不但在朝鲜，并且在我国东北各地接连撒布大量带菌毒虫。在一九五二年六、七月间，细菌战达到了最高潮，第五航空队的各个联队都参加了这种罪行。所有在朝鲜战场的美国空军，都把进行细菌战列为训练课目之一。美国扩大细菌战的主要目的，是企图切断前线朝中人民部队的补给线，使我方的交通运输线和补给区感染细菌，无法进行后勤支援，并使细菌毒物通过供应品传到我军前线阵地，瘫痪我军的作战能力。但是，因为我军有着强固的坑道工事，美国侵略军虽然早已在前线大量使用了细菌炮弹，却没有发生效果。依照美国侵略者的计划，只要使我军后方到前线去的人员和供应品感染了毒菌，就可以把毒菌带入坑道工事，因此美国细菌战的着重点就放在我方的主要交通线上，配合当时美军所进行的所谓“空中绞杀战”，威胁我军前线与后方的联系，并企图以此来影响当时正在进行的停战谈判，增加对朝中方面的压力，取得它在战场上和谈判桌上希望得到而无法得到的东西。马胡林等的供词证明，美国侵略者进行细菌战的意图，是与它当时在战场上和停战谈判会上所表现出来的总的战略意图完全一致的。这就无可辩驳地证明了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，绝对不是洛奇、梅奥之流在联合国大会政治委员会上所能空口否认得了的。
    和以前发表过的美国空军上校许威布尔等六人的供词一样，马胡林等十九人的供词的许多事实都是互相印证的。他们虽然属于不同的部队、被俘和坦白的时间也各不相同，但对美国发动细菌战的复杂情节和技术过程，说得那样详尽明晰，入情入理，如果不是他们亲身参加了细菌战的罪行，是绝对不可能说出来的。如关于美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的时间，许威布尔说：“在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划，是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。”命令经李奇微、威兰下达。这和马胡林、爱文斯等供词的说法是完全一致的。爱文斯转述第五航空队后方指挥所瓦勃尔顿准将的话说：“第五航空队的细菌战活动开始于一九五一年十月参谋长联席会议的决定，即：用空军在当时业已发展成功的武器来进行试验。”“这些试验成功以后，细菌战的计划就于一九五一年十二月获得了正式批准。”他们所说的这个时间，与布莱、奥尼尔、马胡林等所说的都是一致的。所有二十五个参加细菌战的美国空军战俘在供词中都谈到，他们在美国开始在朝鲜发动大规模细菌战的前后，都曾经听过关于细菌战的课程。虽然他们听课的时间和地点有所不同，而课程的内容都是大同小异的。这些美国空军战俘谈到关于参加细菌战的美国飞机的类型，细菌武器的类型，执行细菌作战的方法和各种类型的飞机、细菌武器实际在细菌战中使用的时间，也是一致的。特别是关于“保密”问题，所有的战俘都谈到，在进行细菌战的全部过程中，美国军事当局最强调的就是“保密”。在每次听课、执行细菌战任务的时候，他们被严厉告诫不准泄露有关细菌战的事情，即使空军人员相互之间也绝对禁止谈论。细菌武器和执行细菌战任务，都用代号和暗语。他们都被警告，如有泄密行为，要受军法惩办。所有这些互相印证、互相补充的事实，证明美国侵略者所进行的细菌战，是处心积虑经过长期策划并有着周密布置的。美国侵略者企图抵赖细菌战的罪行是徒然的。
    最近，美国在联合国大会政治委员会上提出所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”，强迫政治委员会进行讨论；并由美国代表梅奥提出什么“宣誓书”，捏造那些已被朝中方面释放的美国空军战俘的翻供，以迷惑世界舆论，掩盖美国在侵朝战争中使用细菌武器的罪行。但是，美国侵略者是枉费心机的。无论它对细菌战罪行怎样狡诈抵赖，是决不可能推翻为我方所掌握着的许威布尔、马胡林等二十五人的供词的。因为这些供词，是美方空军战俘在朝中人民部队宽待政策的感召下，对于他们所作过的细菌战罪行受到自己良心的谴责而自动说出来的，因此这些供词才是如此真实，如此互相印证。美国空军少尉理查·格·瓦斯在他的供词里，就清楚地说明了他坦白细菌战罪行的内心过程，他说：“中国人已经证明他们是我的朋友”，“我所能给予他们作为报答的是忏悔和真话”，“我已经揭发了我国政府投掷细菌弹的邪恶行为。只有当我已经视昔日的敌人为朋友时，我才会揭露这种卑恶行为。”美国战俘在这种情况下所作细菌战罪行供词的真实性是绝对无可怀疑的，也是美国侵略者所绝对不可能推翻的。事实证明，美国侵略者虽矢口抵赖细菌战罪行，诬指许威布尔等人的供词是在朝中方面“酷刑”逼迫下作出来的，然而美国侵略者却只能限于空口诬赖，对美国进行细菌战的各种主要事实，连半点也不能推翻或否认。正相反，美国政府用“军事法庭的审判”和“叛国的罪名”逼迫这些已被我方释放的战俘捏造出来的所谓“宣誓书”，其内容是如此荒诞可笑，甚至奎恩还在美国教书的时候，就被说成已为朝中方面关在“冰冷的洞穴里”了，这样的胡言乱语有谁能够相信呢！
    人所共知，细菌战是违反人类道德、破坏国际法原则和国际公约的最残暴、最野蛮的作战方法。许威布尔、马胡林等二十五人参加了美国在朝鲜发动的细菌战残暴罪行，本应受到严厉的惩罚；但是朝鲜人民军认为他们还不是策划和发动在朝鲜进行细菌战的主要负责者，并且他们在犯罪之后又能坦白认罪，揭露美国侵略者进行细菌战的重重黑幕，所以根据我方对于战俘的一贯宽待政策，在停战后直接交换战俘的时期，就把他们全部释放了。可是，现在他们回到美国之后，人们对他们的安全却发生了怀疑。英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊也在问：“他们是否已经与其他人一道被送到福奇谷精神病院，在麦卡锡的精神病学家的体贴照料下，受洗脑筋治疗去了？为什么不让这些不幸的人说话呢？”美国的通讯社透露，许威布尔等可能受到“军事法庭的审判”。美国政府对待它自己被释放遣返回去的战俘的这种作法，难道不正证明了它进行细菌战的罪行欲盖弥彰吗？
    美国绝对无法掩盖它在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行，还在其他许多问题上得到证明。美国政府一面在联合国大会政治委员会上抵赖进行细菌战的罪行，诬蔑朝中方面对于细菌战的指责是假的，声言要进行所谓“公正调查”；一面却横蛮无理地阻止朝中代表出席联合国大会讨论细菌战问题，并拒绝在联合国大会政治委员会上讨论苏联的提案，即：要求所有那些还没有在规定禁用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书上签字或没有批准这个议定书的国家，在尽可能短的时期内在这个议定书上签字或批准这个议定书。美国如此不敢让朝中代表出席联合国大会，如此不顾世界人民的一致要求而拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，难道不正是证明了它进行细菌战的犯罪的心理吗？
    美国在侵朝战争中进行反人类的细菌战罪行，铁证如山，是无论如何抵赖不了的。除了上述许多事实得到证明外，还有许多国际公正人士特别是由各国著名科学家组成的国际科学委员会、各国法律学家组成的调查团，在实地进行调查各种证据以后，早已无可辩驳地证实了美国这一严重罪行。正当美国在联合国大会上企图洗刷它的罪行的时候，英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊发表的声明，就代表了世界正义人士作了回答。约翰逊说：“在我看来，没有什么不明确的地方。我是坚决相信美国军队在北朝鲜和中国进行了细菌战的。”
