    Our Best Example
    Dai Yinshun, Technician, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company
    I am one of the thousands of technicians who participated in the construction of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. With immense excitement, I have witnessed the commencement of production at our nation's first automated seamless steel tube plant. Every comrade who participated in its construction deeply feels that this is a concrete demonstration of the Soviet people's kind concern for us and a crystallization of our great Sino-Soviet friendship.
    In this factory, steel billets weighing hundreds of kilograms, like living things, automatically go through hundreds of complex processes to become beautiful seamless steel tubes. With our existing technical level, it would have been impossible to undertake this arduous task of building the plant. However, with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, we finally overcame all difficulties and built this factory.
    When our furnace construction project was entering a complex stage, our Soviet expert, Comrade Butnyek, arrived. From the day he arrived, he came to the construction site every day to inspect and guide our work, teaching us how to properly mortise the hanging bricks on the furnace roof, so that each brick joint was between two and three millimeters. Especially when building the regenerator of the reheating furnace, all our technicians and veteran workers felt unfamiliar and found it difficult to install the complex regenerator to meet the design standards. The expert then proposed pre-installation and other construction methods, which enabled our elevation, level, and one-millimeter brick joints to meet the design standards. When building the five parallel large arches on the regenerator chamber, we did not know how to achieve the highest level of force. The expert then told us how to carry out parallel construction, which achieved the maximum load strength. In every aspect of construction technology, we received such selfless assistance. Whenever the expert came to the construction site, everyone said, "Big brother is here," "Big brother" is our affectionate term for relatives, and that's how we called our teacher and friend – the Soviet expert.
    The expert not only helped us technically, but also served as the best example for us to learn from in terms of work and character. He cared about our construction as if it were his own, and he was so passionate and loyal to our work.
    The Seamless Steel Tube Plant is about to start production. On the one hand, we technicians are excited, and on the other hand, we feel a great sense of responsibility. New and arduous tasks await us. We firmly believe that with the help of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and with the correct leadership of our Party, we will definitely be able to complete any construction task assigned to us by the motherland ahead of schedule.

    我们最好的榜样
    鞍钢筑炉工程公司  无缝钢管厂技术员  戴荫荪
    我是建设无缝钢管厂的千百个技术人员之一。怀着万分兴奋的心情，看到我们祖国第一个自动化的无缝钢管厂开始生产钢管了，每一个参加建设的同志都深切地体会到，这是苏联人民对我们亲切关怀的具体证明，这是我们伟大的中苏友谊的结晶。
    在这个工厂里，数百公斤重的钢坯，像个有生命的东西一样，自动地经过了百十道复杂的工序，成了漂亮的无缝钢管。靠着我们现有的技术水平，是无法承担起这个艰巨的建厂任务的，但是，在苏联专家的无私帮助下，我们终于克服了一切困难，把这个工厂建立起来了。
    当我们筑炉工程正开始走向复杂的阶段时，我们的苏联专家——布特湼克同志来到了，他从来的那天开始，每天都到工地来检查和指导我们的工作，教我们怎样砌好炉顶挂砖的咬牙缝，使每个砖缝都在二—三粍之间，尤其是在砌再加热炉的回热装置时，我们全体技术人员和老工人，都感到陌生和困难，没法把那复杂的回热装置安得合乎设计标准，专家又给我们提出预安装和其他的施工方法，这样使我们的标高、水平和一粍的砖缝，都达到了设计标准。在砌回热室上五个并立的大拱时，我们不知怎样干，才能达到最高的受力水平。专家又告诉了我们怎样进行平行砌筑，这样就达到了最大的载荷强度。在每一个施工技术方面，都受到像这样无私的帮助。每当专家来到工地时，大伙都说“大哥来啦，”“大哥”是我们对亲人的爱称，而我们就这样地来称呼着我们的老师和朋友——苏联专家。
    专家不但在技术上给我们帮助，在工作和品质上，也是我们学习的最好榜样，对于我们的建设，像对待自己的建设同样关心，对我们的工作是那样的热爱和忠诚。
    无缝钢管厂要开工了，我们技术人员一方面是兴奋，另方面也感到责任重大。新的艰巨的任务在期待着我们，我们坚信，有了我们伟大盟邦苏联的帮助，有着我们党的正确领导，一定可以提前完成祖国交给我们的任何建设的任务。
