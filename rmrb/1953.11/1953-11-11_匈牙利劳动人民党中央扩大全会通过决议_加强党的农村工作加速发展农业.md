Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th: According to the Hungarian News Agency, Budapest: The Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, held on October 31st, passed an important resolution.

    The resolution first lists facts to demonstrate that the resolution regarding the domestic political and economic situation passed by the Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party in late June of this year was completely correct and practical. As a result of the implementation of this resolution, the living standards of Hungarian workers, peasants, and other working people have improved. Further measures must now be taken to further improve the living standards of the working people.

    The resolution emphasizes: The main task in heavy industry in Hungary at present is to consolidate the existing achievements, and the main task in agricultural production cooperatives is to consolidate the existing production cooperatives and increase their production and income. The current backwardness of Hungarian agriculture compared to industry has become an obstacle to further improving the living standards of the working people. Therefore, the current task of the Party is to rely on the enormous achievements the country has achieved in industrialization and the relatively developed heavy industry to vigorously eliminate the backwardness in agriculture and increase agricultural production. This is a key issue in Hungary's socialist construction in the next two to three years and a decisive link in Hungary's future development. The resolution states that in the 1954 plan, attention will be paid to accelerating the development of agriculture, light industry, and food industry production, so that it develops proportionally to the production of heavy industry. The resolution also puts forward tasks for heavy industries such as metallurgy and coal mining, as well as light industry and the food industry, in terms of improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing production, and explains the inseparable relationship between completing these tasks and further improving the lives of workers.

    The resolution states: Facts since the Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party in June have proven that the working peasants have become increasingly closely united and support the policies of the Party and the government. Under the leadership of the Party, the effective struggle waged by the working peasants to defend agricultural production cooperatives demonstrates that socialist agricultural production cooperatives have taken root in Hungary. The increasing demand of peasants for agricultural means of production proves that the enthusiasm of all peasants for production has been increased. In view of this, the Party and the government have decided to formulate fundamental measures to vigorously develop agriculture. The policy of developing agriculture will strengthen the foundation of our people's democratic system – the worker-peasant alliance.

    The resolution concludes by discussing the achievements made in developing criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and emphasizes: One of the Party's main tasks at present is to eliminate the backwardness of the Party in rural work, and it must concentrate its efforts to strive to complete and overfulfill the plans for 1953 and 1954.

    匈牙利劳动人民党中央扩大全会通过决议
    加强党的农村工作加速发展农业
    【新华社布拉格十日电】据匈牙利通讯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会十月三十一日举行的扩大全体会议，通过了一项重要决议。
    决议首先列举事实，说明匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会今年六月底举行的扩大全体会议所通过的关于国内政治和经济形势的决议，是完全正确而且切合实际的。由于执行这个决议的结果，匈牙利工人、农民及其他劳动人民生活水平提高了。现在还要采取措施以进一步提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    决议强调指出：目前匈牙利重工业方面的主要任务是巩固已有的成就，农业生产合作社方面的主要任务是巩固已有的生产合作社，并增加其生产和收入。目前匈牙利农业和工业比较起来的落后状况，已成为进一步提高劳动人民生活水平的障碍，因此，党的目前任务就是依靠国家在工业化方面所获得的巨大成就和比较发展的重工业，来大力消除农业方面的落后状况，增加农业生产。这是今后两三年内匈牙利在社会主义建设方面的关键问题，也是匈牙利今后发展的决定性环节。决议表示，在一九五四年计划中，将注意加速发展农业、轻工业和食品工业的生产，使之与重工业的生产成比例地发展。决议并提出冶金、煤矿等重工业及轻工业、食品工业在提高质量、减低成本、增加生产等方面的任务，并且说明了完成这些任务和进一步提高工人生活之间的不可分的关系。
    决议说：党中央委员会六月扩大全体会议以来的事实证明，劳动农民已越来越紧密地团结起来，支持党和政府的政策。在党的领导下，劳动农民为保卫农业生产合作社而进行的有效的斗争，说明了社会主义性质的农业生产合作社已在匈牙利生了根。农民对于农业生产资料的要求日益增加，这些事实证明全体农民生产热情提高了。有鉴于此，党和政府已决定制订根本性的措施，以大力发展农业。而发展农业的政策将加强我们人民民主制度的基础——工农联盟。
    决议最后谈到在开展党内批评与自我批评方面所获得的成绩，并强调指出：党在当前的主要任务之一，便是消除党在农村工作方面落后状况，而且必须集中力量争取完成和超额完成一九五三年和一九五四年的计划。
