(Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 3rd) According to a TASS report from Geneva on the 2nd: The Executive Committee meeting of the League of Red Cross Societies concluded on the 1st in Geneva. Representatives from the Red Cross societies of eighteen countries, including the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, the United States, and Iran, participated in the meeting. Observers from Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Finland were also present.

    The Executive Committee unanimously adopted the proposal of the delegation of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union. The proposal calls on the governments of all countries, especially the governments of the countries participating in the Korean political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, to make every effort to seek a final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The proposal also calls on all Red Cross societies, Red Crescent societies, and Red Lion and Sun societies to exert all their strength to promote the final resolution of this important international issue.

    Su Jingguan, the representative of the Chinese Red Cross, spoke at the meeting, discussing the obstruction by the United Nations forces, particularly the US representatives, of the repatriation of prisoners of war from the Korean War. Su Jingguan said: "The US military authorities have not abandoned their plan. They have placed special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps, continuing to intimidate and threaten prisoners of war, and using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to forcibly detain prisoners of war and deprive them of the opportunity to return home to live peaceful lives."

    The US representative Nicholson, who served as chairman during the discussion of this issue, interrupted Su Jingguan's speech more than once. Nicholson finally stopped him from speaking on the pretext that Su Jingguan's speech was too far off topic.

    The Soviet and Chinese representatives firmly protested the chairman's discriminatory behavior. The Soviet and Indian representatives supported the Chinese representative and voted in favor of the Chinese delegation's proposal, which demanded that the governments concerned strictly abide by and implement all agreements already signed concerning prisoners of war in Korea, so that prisoners of war can exercise their right to return home to live peaceful lives. However, the US delegation caused the Executive Committee to reject this proposal.

    The Chairman of the Belgian Red Cross, de Mérode, put forward a proposal requesting the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union to help find and repatriate Belgian citizens who were allegedly detained in the Soviet Union. However, the Belgian representative could not even give a single name. The Soviet representatives strongly opposed the Belgian proposal, reminding the delegates that TASS had issued a statement saying that the Soviet Union had completed the repatriation of prisoners of war and was now considering the repatriation of war criminals who had completed their sentences or had been pardoned by the Soviet government. For example, the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union is holding negotiations with the Japanese Red Cross on this issue.

    Since the Belgian proposal was unfounded, the Chairman of the Norwegian Red Cross, Steen, and even the US representative Nicholson, expressed their opposition, and de Mérode had to withdraw his proposal.

    红十字会协会执委会会议通过苏联提案
    号召各国政府尽力谋求和平解决朝鲜问题
    我国代表苏井观谴责美国阻挠战俘遣返工作
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦二日讯：红十字会协会执行委员会会议一日在日内瓦结束。参加这次会议的有英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、美国、伊朗等十八个国家的红十字会的代表。到会的还有罗马尼亚、匈牙利、波兰和芬兰的观察员。
    执行委员会一致通过苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会代表团的提案。提案号召所有国家的政府，首先是参加朝鲜停战协定所规定召开的朝鲜政治会议的国家的政府，尽一切努力来谋求最后和平解决朝鲜问题。提案也号召所有的红十字会、红新月会和红狮与太阳会，尽一切力量促使这个重要的国际问题得到最后解决。
    中国红十字会代表苏井观在会上发言，谈到联合国军特别是美国代表阻碍遣返朝鲜战争中的战俘。苏井观说：“美国军事当局并没有放弃他们的计划。他们在战俘营中布置了特务，继续恐吓和威胁战俘，利用一切阴谋诡计来强迫扣留战俘，并剥夺战俘回家过和平生活的机会。”
    在讨论这个问题时担任主席的美国代表尼科尔逊，不止一次地打断苏井观的发言。尼科尔逊最后藉口苏井观的发言离题太远而制止他发言。
    苏联和中国代表坚决抗议主席的这种歧视举动。苏联和印度代表支持中国代表，并投票赞成中国代表团的提案，提案要求有关各国政府严格遵守并执行业已签订的有关在朝鲜的战俘的一切协定，使战俘得以行使他们回家过和平生活的权利。但是，美国代表团使执行委员会否决了这个提案。
    比利时红十字会主席德梅罗德提出一项提案，要求苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会帮助寻找并遣返据说是扣留在苏联的比利时公民。但是，比利时代表甚至连一个名字也举不出来。苏联代表们强烈反对比利时的提案，他们提醒与会代表，塔斯社曾发表声明说，苏联已经完成了遣俘工作，现在正在考虑遣返已经服刑期满或得到苏联政府宽赦的战犯的问题。例如，苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会就在和日本红十字会就这个问题举行谈判。
    由于比利时提案毫无根据，挪威红十字会主席斯廷，甚至美国代表尼科尔逊都表示反对，德梅罗德因而不得不把他的提案撤回。
