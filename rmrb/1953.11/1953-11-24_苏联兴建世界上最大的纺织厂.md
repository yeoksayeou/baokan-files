Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd - According to TASS: The Soviet Union is currently undertaking large-scale capital construction in the light industry sector. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, investment in this area will be two and a half times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The allocation of funds for expanding the production capacity of various departments has significantly increased, such as 4.3 times for the silk weaving industry, 3.3 times for the wool weaving industry, and approximately 3 times for the clothing industry. Next year, the allocation of funds for new construction and renovation of knitting enterprises will be 17 million rubles more than this year.

    Most noteworthy is that many of the world's largest new textile factories are being built in the textile industry. For example, the new textile factory in Kamyshin on the Volga River covers approximately 65 hectares. It will be equipped with approximately 500,000 spindles and 15,500 looms. The factory will build seventeen kindergartens, fifteen nurseries, and so on. The new textile factory in Engels will also be equipped with 400,000 spindles and approximately 9,000 looms. Similar factories are also being built in Barnaul, Cheboksary, and Kherson. The operation of these five enterprises alone will increase the Soviet Union's total textile production by at least one billion meters, mainly in high-quality velvet, flannel, and so on. Giant textile factories are also being built elsewhere. For example, a factory in Kiev is being built to produce 30 million meters of silk fabrics annually. In the Urals, a fine woolen mill complex being built in Sverdlovsk is preparing to install 30,000 spindles and will produce 6 million meters of various woolen fabrics annually. In the next three years, eleven silk enterprises will be renovated and expanded, fifteen large woolen mills will be built, and thirty-four woolen factories will be fundamentally renovated. By 1955, the looms put into production in the entire textile industry will be 5.1 times that of this year, and the looms in the wool weaving industry will be 15 times that of this year.

    Many giant new knitting, clothing, and shoe factories are also being built throughout the country. In the next two to three years, more than thirty large-scale knitting factories will be built or renovated. It is estimated that the renovation of only two wool spinning mills for knitting wool yarn will more than double the production of knitting wool yarn. The hosiery factory being built in Cheboksary next year will produce 20 million pairs of socks, 10 million pieces of knitted underwear, 2 million sweaters, thick sportswear, jackets, and ski suits annually. In the next two to three years, the Soviet Union will build seventy new clothing factories and expand eighty-three existing clothing factories. Expansion work in clothing factories in various places has been widely carried out. The largest clothing factory in the Soviet Union will soon be built in Molotov. This factory will produce 1,721,000 pieces of clothing annually. In addition, giant leather factories and shoe factories are being built in Ulyanovsk, Gorky, Voronezh, Stalingrad, Oryol, and other places, as well as in Ukraine, the Baltic coastal republics, and eastern Siberia. Almost all existing shoe factories will be renovated or expanded.

    苏联兴建世界上最大的纺织厂
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联目前正在轻工业方面进行大规模的基本建设。第五个五年计划期间这方面的投资将为第四个五年计划的两倍半。扩充各部门生产能力的拨款大大增加，如丝织业为四点三倍，毛织业三点三倍，服装工业三倍左右。明年用在新建和改建针织品企业的拨款将比今年多一千七百万卢布。
    最值得注意的是，纺织工业方面正在兴建许多世界上最大的新纺织厂。例如伏尔加河上卡米新的纺织厂，占地六十五公顷左右。厂内将安装约五十万个纱锭和一万五千五百架织布机。工厂内将兴建十七个幼儿园、十五个托儿所等等。恩格斯城的新纺织厂也将安装四十万纱锭和约九千架织布机。巴尔瑙尔、契鲍克萨利和刻松也在兴建同样的工厂。单是这五个企业开工，就将使苏联纺织品总产量至少要增加十亿公尺，产品主要是上等天鹅绒、法兰绒等。其他地方也在兴建巨型纺织厂。例如基辅正在建筑每年生产三千万公尺丝织品的工厂。在乌拉尔，斯维德洛夫斯克兴建的一座细呢联合工厂准备安装三万个纱锭，每年将生产六百万公尺各式各样的毛织品。今后三年中将有十一个丝织企业将予以改建和扩大，将建筑十五个大毛织厂并根本改建三十四个毛织工厂。到一九五五年，整个纺织工业中开工生产的织布机将为今年的五点一倍；毛织工业的织布机将为今年的十五倍。
    许多巨型的针织品、服装和制鞋新工厂也在各地兴建起来。今后两三年中兴建或改建的大型针织厂将有三十多个。据估计，其中仅改建二个供针织毛纱的毛纺厂就能使针织品毛纱产量增为两倍多。明年在契鲍克萨利兴建的织袜工厂，每年将生产二千万双袜子、一千万件针织内衣、二百万件绒线衣、厚运动衣、短上衣和滑雪衣。今后两三年内苏联将建筑七十个新的服装工厂，扩充八十三个现有服装工厂。各地服装工厂扩建工作已广泛展开。莫洛托夫城即将兴建一座全苏联最大的服装工厂。这座工厂每年将生产一百七十二万一千件衣服。此外，乌利扬诺夫斯克、高尔基、沃罗涅兹、斯大林格勒、奥勒尔等地以及乌克兰、波罗的海沿岸各共和国及西伯利亚东部都在兴建巨型皮革工厂和制鞋厂。几乎所有现有的制鞋厂都将改建或扩大。
