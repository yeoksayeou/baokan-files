Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th. The New York "Daily Worker" of the 23rd reported that the National Committee of the American Communist Party issued a statement signed by William Z. Foster, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Pettis Perry, calling on organized labor and its allies in the United States to use joint action to defeat McCarthy-style pro-fascists and warmongers.

The statement said: McCarthyism is closely related to the ongoing frantic activities in the United States to prepare for a war of aggression. These activities include establishing air bases around the Soviet Union and People's China, undermining peace in Korea, trying to expand the war in Indochina, and continuously using the American people's billions of dollars in a frantic attempt to dominate the world. The result of McCarthyism will be national destruction.

The statement exposed the recent attacks on former President Truman (Attorney General Brownell of the Eisenhower administration attacked Truman for employing someone in the government who was allegedly "pro-communist," and that person had been dead for several years), pointing out that the direct purpose of this attack was to divert people's attention from the ever-deepening dangers that the Eisenhower government brought to the United States.

The statement said: They use the method of frantically labeling people as "reds" to confuse the masses. The purpose is to quell the increasingly strong dissatisfaction of farmers due to their increasingly difficult situation, eliminate workers' resentment, and prevent people from seeing the deepening economic crisis. The Republican Party, having suffered some election defeats recently, wants to use the frantic clamor of labeling people as "reds" to carry out the 1954 elections.

The statement continued: Defending the communists who are now being charged and tried under the Smith Act, the McCarran Act, and the Disturbing the Peace Act, and fighting for the release of Eugene Dennis, Ben Davis, and many others who have been imprisoned under these laws, is an important part of the struggle against McCarthyism.

The struggle to defend the legal rights of the Communist Party is the primary policy of the entire struggle to defend the Bill of Rights. The undeniable fact is that Truman, Meany, and Reuther (Meany was the president of the American Federation of Labor, and Reuther was the president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations), who were fiercely anti-Soviet and chaotic in labeling people as "reds," have greatly fueled and continue to fuel the threat of McCarthyism.

Obviously, labor and its allies must oppose the Eisenhower government, not only its domestic policies but also its decisive foreign policy. It is impossible to support the Eisenhower government's aggressive imperialist war policy on the one hand and effectively combat McCarthyism on the other. They must accept the realistic policy of conducting international consultations on the basis of peaceful coexistence between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In the face of the growing economic crisis, the increasingly rampant threat of McCarthyism, and the continuing growth of disastrous war dangers, the American people have many serious and urgent problems to solve.

The time is ripe for organized labor and its allies to take united action to defeat the McCarthyite pro-fascists and warmongers and achieve great political victories.

### 美国共产党全国委员会发表声明  号召美国劳动人民击败法西斯战争势力

    美国共产党全国委员会发表声明
    号召美国劳动人民击败法西斯战争势力
    【新华社柏林二十七日电】二十三日的纽约“工人日报”报道：美国共产党全国委员会发表了一篇由威廉·兹·福斯特、伊丽莎白·葛莱·弗林和佩蒂斯·佩里签署的声明，号召美国有组织的劳工及其同盟者用联合行动击败麦卡锡之流亲法西斯分子和战争贩子。
    声明说：麦卡锡主义与美国正在进行的疯狂的准备侵略战争的活动有着密切的联系，这些活动是在苏联和人民中国四周设立空军基地、破坏朝鲜和平、设法扩大印度支那战争，把美国人民的亿万财富不断地用于称霸世界的疯狂企图。麦卡锡主义的结果会是全国的毁灭。
    声明揭露最近发动的对前总统杜鲁门的攻击
  （艾森豪威尔政府的司法部长布朗纳尔攻击杜鲁门曾任用了一个据说是“亲共”的人在政府任职，那个人已死了几年了），指出这种攻击的直接目的是要转移人民的视线，使他们不注意艾森豪威尔政府给美国带来的日益加深的危险。
    声明说：他们用疯狂的扣红帽子的办法来迷惑群众，其目的是想平息农民因为处境日益困难而产生的日益强烈的不满，消除工人的怨恨，是想使人民看不到不断加深的经济危机。共和党在最近遭到了一些选举中的失败的情况下，想用扣红帽子的疯狂喧嚷来进行一九五四年的选举。
    声明继续说：保卫现在根据史密斯法、麦卡伦法和扰乱治安法而被控和受审的共产党员，和争取释放根据这些法律被监禁的尤金·丹尼斯、本·戴维斯和其他许多人的斗争，是反对麦卡锡主义斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    保卫共产党合法权利的斗争是整个保卫权利宣言的斗争的首要方针。不可置辩的事实是：激烈反苏和乱扣红帽子的杜鲁门、米尼和路德（按米尼为美国劳联主席，路德是产联主席），曾大大助长了并且还在继续助长着麦卡锡主义的威胁。
    显然，劳工和它的同盟者必须反对艾森豪威尔政府，不仅反对它的国内政策，而且要反对它的有决定意义的外交政策。不可能一方面支持艾森豪威尔政府的侵略性的帝国主义战争政策，而同时又能和麦卡锡主义作有效的斗争。他们必须接受在美国和苏联和平共处的基础上进行国际协商这种现实的政策。
    在日益增长的经济危机、越来越猖狂的麦卡锡主义的威胁和继续增长的灾难性的战争危险面前，美国人民有许多严重的和迫切的问题需要解决。
    有组织的劳工和它的同盟者采取一致行动来击败麦卡锡派亲法西斯分子和战争贩子、取得巨大的政治胜利的时机已经成熟了。
