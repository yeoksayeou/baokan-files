The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a notice to organizations at the provincial and municipal levels and above, regarding the celebration of the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The notice first pointed out: In this year's celebrations of the 36th anniversary of the October Revolution, the organizations of the Democratic Women's Federations at all levels should work closely with the local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations. Under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels, they should educate women from all walks of life to more deeply understand the importance of Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. At the same time, in light of the specific ideological situations of women in their localities, they should publicize and promote the noble qualities of Soviet women in loving their country and selflessly engaging in labor to build their country. They should also publicize the achievements and experiences of Soviet women in overcoming difficulties, learning technology, and creating enormous wealth for their country, as well as how Soviet women, with a high sense of responsibility, correctly cherish and cultivate the next generation of the country.

Regarding the methods of carrying out publicity activities, the notice stipulated: The organizations of the Democratic Women's Federations in major administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities should, under the unified leadership of the local CCP committees and in close coordination with the local Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations, appropriately organize women to participate in various local celebration activities, such as attending commemorative meetings and symposiums, joining in festivities with local Soviet friends, visiting Soviet photo exhibitions, and watching Soviet films, based on the situation of women in their localities. Where conditions permit, women who have visited the Soviet Union may be organized to give reports, or female workers, female scientists and technicians, and female medical and health workers who have made outstanding achievements in learning or promoting advanced Soviet experience may be organized to hold seminars to exchange experiences and thoughts. In larger cities, women can also be organized to read the "Soviet Woman" magazine, through which women can learn more about the lives of Soviet women.
