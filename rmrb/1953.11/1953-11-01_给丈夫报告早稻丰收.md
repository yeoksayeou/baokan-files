Editor's Note: Comrade Li Yeli is a special-class agricultural labor model and model family member of revolutionary armymen in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, and an executive member of the Provincial Women's Federation... Her husband, Liu Hedao, joined the Volunteer Army in 1950. The following is a letter from Li Yeli to her husband reporting the bumper harvest in her hometown.

　　　　　　　　＊        ＊     　 ＊
Dearest Hedao:

Usually, I feel like I have a bellyful of things to tell you, but somehow, when I really want to say them, I don't know where to start.

In August, the early rice here ripened, and everyone was busy harvesting. The rice from our agricultural production cooperative yielded more than in previous years, averaging more than 290 jin of dry grain per mu. The densely planted nine-fen wheat fields yielded more than 610 jin. Altogether, the average yield increased by more than 30 percent compared to last year! Not only did the cooperative increase production, but the entire township celebrated a bumper harvest. The mutual aid teams' rice yields increased by 19 percent compared to last year, and individual farmers also saw an average increase of 14 percent. Old farmers in their sixties and seventies all said: They had never seen such a big harvest in their entire lives!

On August 26th, the cooperative held its first dividend distribution. More than 44,000 jin of golden rice were distributed over two whole days. Li Guangcai's family, because they had more labor and worked hard, received 48 dan of rice. Our family also received 15 dan, 5 dan more than last year. The big yellow ox that the People's Government awarded us also earned more than 500 jin of rice!

The day of the dividend distribution was truly lively. Men, women, old, and young, all smiled from ear to ear, just like celebrating the New Year. The children were even more boisterous, clamoring to their parents to buy them schoolbags and make new clothes. Many people also came to watch the excitement. Everyone said, "If we hadn't joined the cooperative, how could we have received so much rice!" This dividend distribution was very good, and every member was satisfied, believing it was fair and reasonable, with no one being taken advantage of.

Hedao, you know that the soil in our township is poor, the water source is scarce, and there are many mountain valleys. In the past, we had droughts every two or three years, and everyone was helpless. Now, under the good leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the unity of the people, we can fight against droughts and floods! Take this year, for example. When the early rice was flowering and filling, it didn't rain, and the seedlings were all dried and yellow, hanging their heads low. But the cooperative had a lot of labor and could allocate it easily, and everyone worked together to quickly overcome the drought. The late rice was the same, growing only after enduring forty days of drought resistance. It looks like it will yield even more than the early rice!

After these struggles, the cooperative members know even more about the benefits of further organizing, and their enthusiasm for production is growing. A few days ago, the cooperative drew up a winter plowing and winter planting plan, and extracted some labor to engage in sideline occupations. The rest are at home carrying out rescue and rush planting work. As soon as the early rice was harvested, the cooperative sent people to the Litian District Native Produce Company to buy more than 900 jin of broad bean seeds and to the Huaizhong District to buy 150 jin of safflower seeds. Everyone is gathering their strength to lay the foundation for increasing grain production next year.

Hedao, you must be smiling when you see this. You will surely say to yourself, "These are truly good days!" But you will also know that even better days are yet to come. I often think: When you return victoriously, I don't know what our place will have become!

### 给丈夫报告早稻丰收

　　给丈夫报告早稻丰收
    编者按：李页俚同志是江西省永新县的特等农业劳动模范和军属模范，省妇女联合会的执行委员，……。她的丈夫刘和道一九五○年参加了志愿军。下面，是李页俚给她丈夫报告家乡丰收的一封信。
　　　　　　　　＊        ＊     　 ＊亲爱的和道：
    平常，我总觉得有一肚子话要向你说，可是，不知怎么的，真正要说的时候，也不知从什么地方说起。
    八月间，咱这里的早稻成熟了，大家都忙着收割。咱那农业生产合作社的稻子，比往年打得都多，每亩平均是二百九十多斤干谷，九分小麦密植地，打了六百一十多斤。合计起来，平均比去年增产了百分之三十还要多！不单是社里增产，全乡也普庆丰收。互助组的稻子，比去年增产了百分之十九，单干户，也平均比去年增产了百分之十四。六、七十岁的老年农民都说：活了一辈子，也没见过这样大的丰收！
    八月二十六日，社里进行了第一次分红。四万四千多斤金黄谷子，直分了两天。李光财家，劳动力多，劳动也好，分了四十八担谷子。咱家也分了十五担，比去年多分五担。人民政府奖给咱的那头大黄牛，也分了五百多斤谷子！
    分红那天，可真热闹啦。男女老少都笑得合不拢嘴，就像过新年一样。小孩子闹得更厉害，他们吵着自己的爹妈，要叫给他们买书包，做新衣服。好多群众也跑来围着看热闹。谁不说：“要不是参加了合作社，那能分到这么多谷子！”这次分红分得很好，社员个个都满意，认为公平合理，互不吃亏。
    和道，你是知道的，咱们乡里的土质坏，水源差，山沟地多，过去三年两头旱，大伙瞪着眼没有办法。如今毛主席领导的好，群众的心也齐，旱灾、水灾，都能和它斗一斗！就说今年吧，早稻到扬花灌浆的时候，天还没落雨，禾苗都晒得干黄干黄的，低拉着头。可是合作社的劳动力多，调配着方便，大伙拧到一块，很快就战胜了旱灾。晚稻也是一样，整整经过了四十天的抗旱，禾苗才成长起来。眼下看来，准比早稻收得多！
    社员经过这些斗争后，对进一步组织起来的好处，知道得更多，生产的劲头也越来越大。前些日子，社里就订出了冬耕、冬种计划，抽出了一部分劳动力去搞副业，剩下的，都在家里进行抢救，抢种工作。早稻刚收完，社里就派人到礼田区土产公司买回了九百多斤蚕豆籽，又到怀忠区买了一百五十斤红花籽，大家都攒足了劲，要为明年的粮食增产打下底子。
    和道，你看到这里，心里也会在笑吧。你一定会暗自说：“这真是好日子！”可是，你也会知道，更好的日子还在后头呢。我常想：当你胜利回来时，咱这里也不知道会变成个啥样子！		 页俚
