　　Testimony of Lieutenant Rogie Warren, Pilot of the 69th Bomber Squadron, 58th Bomber Group, 58th Bomber Wing, US Air Force

    I am Lieutenant Rogie Warren, service number AO-2223184, pilot in the 69th Bomber Squadron, 58th Bomber Group, 58th Bomber Wing.
    I was born on January 21, 1929. My home is at 302 Standish Road, Syracuse, New York. In September 1946, I began my university education at Cornell University, majoring in Agricultural Engineering, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in June 1950.
    I joined the Air Force on February 23, 1951. After completing pilot training, I was transferred to the Far East. I left the United States on July 5, 1952, and arrived at Itazuke, Japan, on July 9, 1952. On July 15, 1952, I arrived at K-2 base in Korea and was assigned to the 58th Bomber Group. At the time I was shot down, my position was pilot. I was shot down and captured on January 15, 1953, in Sinanju, Korea.
    On July 11, while at Itazuke, Japan, I attended an introductory talk by Colonel Baker. He was then the commander of the 58th Bomber Wing. He first welcomed the new pilots to the Group, then he explained the work of the 58th Group in combat, mainly attack missions, and secondly, front-line support missions. He said that sometimes bacteriological weapons were used in attack missions. I was shocked by the fact that we had to carry out bacteriological warfare missions. At the end of his talk, he introduced an officer to us, saying that this officer would give us a series of lessons.
    Classes began on July 12. We were divided into two groups, about nine or ten pilots in each group. I can't remember the name of the lecturer, but on the afternoons of July 12, 13, and 14, the group I was in took lessons on bacteriological warfare. The pilots in my group were: Curtis Carlyle, Kidd, Lieutenant Reisdorf, and myself, the other five or six I can't remember now.
    The topic of the first lesson was why the United States thought it necessary to use bacteriological warfare. He began by saying that the 58th Group had been carrying out bacteriological warfare missions for several months. While talking about the fact that bacteriological weapons were being used, he said that this weapon would continue to be used until the desired results were obtained. He said that all bomber groups in Korea were using bacteriological weapons, and the 58th Group was no exception. If the enemy does not show signs of weakening, it is certain that bacteriological warfare will continue, and may even be strengthened in the future.
    The second lesson he gave us was "The Development and History of Bacteriological Warfare." He talked about how Japan had tried hard to develop an effective bacteriological weapon during World War II. After the war, the United States found some Japanese scientists and hired them to continue research and development of bacteriological weapons in laboratories. They were trying to improve the effectiveness of bacteriological bombs and find new and better ways to use and disseminate bacteria and germ-carrying insects. He went on to say that one of the first types of bacteriological bombs used was small in size and not very effective in practice. Then they adopted a 500-pound bomb with a door, which was considered more effective in spreading what it contained than the previous one. Later they developed a bacteriological bomb containing a small amount of explosive. This bomb looked similar to a 500-pound ordinary bomb. Tests proved that it was more effective than the door type bomb because it could hold more bacterial liquid or germ-carrying insects, and its explosive force could spread what it contained over a larger area. This type of bacteriological bomb is considered to be the best of the existing bacteriological bombs and is now widely used. He said that the insects used in this type of bomb include flies, fleas, lice, and mosquitoes, and the bacteria carried by these insects include plague, typhoid, cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever.
    In the last lesson, he talked to us about how to use bacteriological bombs. He said that the current missions carrying bacteriological bombs are to attack troop concentrations, water sources and reservoirs, and to cut off railways. The purpose of bombing troop concentrations is to infect soldiers and civilians, and the task of cutting off railways is to infect railway construction workers.
    Then he talked about the tactics currently being used. About five minutes before reaching the target, all the planes should descend from their original altitude to nine thousand feet, and drop the bombs at about four thousand feet. Then the pilot should quickly fly away, return to the squadron, and fly back to base.
    The above is, to the best of my memory, the knowledge about bacteriological warfare that I received at Itazuke. For the sake of secrecy, we were warned not to talk to anyone about this matter at the end of each lesson.
    On July 15, 1952, I arrived at K-2 base. After we settled in at the base and received our flight equipment, etc., on July 16, Lieutenant Colonel Sharpe gave an introductory speech to us new pilots.
    He began by introducing the mission of the 58th Group, which was roughly the same as what Colonel Baker had said at Itazuke. He said that in some general missions we would find ourselves carrying bacteriological bombs instead of ordinary bombs. He also talked about the importance of bacteriological warfare missions in the current Korean War, and that we must carry them out according to orders.
    During the training flight period, I took more lessons on bacteriological warfare, on July 17 and 18, 1952. The pilots who participated in these lectures with me were Lieutenant Curtis Carlyle, Lieutenant McKinney, Lieutenant Bustin, Lieutenant Kidd, Lieutenant Kimmelshul, Lieutenant O'Brien, Lieutenant Roberts, Lieutenant Shaffin, Lieutenant Reisdorf, Lieutenant Winston Sumonson, and myself. I can't remember the others. Lieutenant Byondo lectured us. Most of the bacteriological warfare courses he taught were repetitions of what we had heard in the past.
    At the end of each lecture, he always reminded us that this was secret information and that we were not allowed to talk to anyone about the content of the lectures.
    Around September 15, our squadron and two other squadrons were scheduled to carry out a mission. Lieutenant Salisbury was the leader of our squadron in this mission. The briefing was held at about 8:00 a.m. Lieutenant Melvin Hart was the briefing officer. The target he gave was about five miles north of Ji'an in Manchuria. He said that Salisbury's squadron was to carry out a bacteriological warfare mission, with four planes, each carrying two bacteriological bombs, and the other two squadrons were to carry ordinary bombs. Lieutenant Hart also said that there would be twelve F-86 escorts and another twenty-four F-86s would patrol along the Yalu River. Then Lieutenant Nash gave the intelligence briefing. He said that the nature of the target was a troop concentration on the north bank of the Yalu River, and the order stipulated that bacteriological bombs be carried out for this mission. He also mentioned the information on how to escape if the pilot was shot down. Then the mission leader, Colonel Walford, gave the briefing. He first repeated the time of take-off, arrival over the target, and checkpoints. Then he talked to us in detail about the tactics and formation of this mission.
    At about 9:45 a.m., we started the engines and took off. This was the first time I was to fly over the Yalu River, so I was very nervous. The matter of carrying bacteriological bombs first caused a terrible feeling in my heart. We flew towards the target according to the briefing. The F-86 aircraft came, and five minutes south of the Yalu River, we descended to nine thousand feet. At about four thousand feet, I dropped my two bacteriological bombs. Then I flew away, returned to the squadron, flew back to base, and landed. After landing, we made a standard report. Finally, we all signed the standard confidentiality form.
    On October 9, I was scheduled to carry out another bacteriological warfare mission. The briefing was held in the morning. The briefing officer (I can't remember his name) gave his standard briefing. The target was a troop concentration about five miles north of Ji'an in Manchuria. A total of twelve planes were ordered to carry out this mission, each carrying two bacteriological bombs. He also said that twenty-four F-86s would patrol along the Yalu River and another twelve would provide escort. The intelligence officer was Lieutenant Norris. He told us the nature of the target and emphasized that each pilot needed to carefully drop the bombs accurately on the target. The ground liaison officer and the meteorologist also gave their briefings. The mission leader, Major Shelley, then gave the briefing. He talked to us about the formation and tactics used in this mission. We took off according to the briefing. About five minutes south of the Yalu River, we descended and formed a column formation. At nine thousand feet, we resumed horizontal flight and adjusted the buttons in preparation for bombing. At an altitude of four thousand feet, I dropped two bacteriological bombs, then flew away, looking for the rest of my squadron, and joined them on the return flight. After landing, we made a regular report. At the end of the report, we each had to sign the standard confidentiality form. The pilots who carried out this mission were Major Colin Shelley, Lieutenant Leroy Martin, Lieutenant Winston Sumonson, Lieutenant James Laru, and myself. I can't remember the rest.
    On December 20, I was scheduled to carry out my last bacteriological warfare mission. Lieutenant Laru was my squadron leader. The briefing was held at about 7:00 a.m. Lieutenant Kesman, the briefing officer, first said that this was a mixed mission including cutting off the railway and bacteriological warfare. He told us the location of the target, which was about fifteen miles south of Pyongyang. A total of thirty-six planes were dispatched, of which twelve were to carry out bacteriological warfare missions. Lieutenant Kesman told us that Lieutenant Laru's squadron and two other squadrons were carrying bacteriological bombs. Twelve planes, each carrying two, and the remaining twenty-four carrying ordinary bombs. Then Lieutenant Nash, the intelligence officer, gave the briefing. He said that the nature of the mission was to cut off the railway at this particular extension and drop bacteriological bombs around the cut sections of the railway. He also mentioned the necessity of dropping the bacteriological bombs correctly, otherwise their effectiveness would be lost. The ground liaison officer gave the current ground situation at the front. The meteorologist gave the briefing including the water temperature and the time of the tide. Then the mission leader, Colonel Walford, conducted his briefing. He reiterated the time to start the engines and take off, in case some people did not know. The time to reach the target was 10:00 a.m., and the altitude en route was 20,000 feet.
    We took off at about 9:20 a.m. The procedure to reach the target area was carried out according to the briefing, and everything was normal. About five minutes away from the target, we descended to nine thousand feet and adjusted our buttons and bomb sights. Then Colonel Walford ordered to enter the target, and we all followed. At an altitude of four thousand feet, I dropped two bacteriological bombs and flew away from the target to join my squadron. After landing at the base, we conducted the report as we had done in the past.
    As far as I remember, the pilots who carried out this mission were Colonel Walford, Captain Schneider, Lieutenant Laru, Lieutenant Patterson, Lieutenant Sherhouse, Lieutenant Ingram, Major Miller, and myself. I can't remember the rest now.
    Between August 1952 and January 1953, I flew seventy-one missions in North Korea and China, of which twelve were bacteriological warfare missions. In addition to the above three bacteriological warfare missions, the other nine are as follows:
    On about September 6, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Xuancheon.
    On about September 22, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Gunuri.
    On about October 13, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Jiangjie.
    On about October 20, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Gunuri.
    On about October 28, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Anju.
    On about November 4, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Sinanju.
    On about November 15, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs about five miles north of Ji'an in Manchuria.
    On about November 29, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Haeju.
    On about December 3, 1952, I dropped two bacteriological bombs in Wonsan.
    I deeply abhor bacteriological warfare, and I despise myself for having had anything to do with it. I constantly felt mental distress during my stay at Itazuke and K-2 bases. The continued use of bacteriological weapons was deeply gnawing at my heart, and my conscience gave me much trouble. I have committed the crime of mass murder. Good and peace-loving people all over the world will surely stop the conduct of bacteriological warfare, and I hope that it can be eradicated forever. I pray to God to help us transform the crazy and chaotic world like today, and not let us try to do this kind of thing again.

　　美国空军第五十八战斗轰炸机联队第五十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十九战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉罗吉·华伦的供词
    我是罗吉·华伦中尉，军号ＡＯ—２２２３１８４，在第五十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十九战斗轰炸机中队任驾驶员。
    我生于一九二九年一月二十一日。我家在纽约州西拉克斯城斯坦迪什道第三○二号。一九四六年九月，我在康奈尔大学开始受大学教育，主修农业工程，一九五○年六月得到科学学士学位。
    一九五一年二月二十三日我加入空军，受完飞行员训练后，便被调到远东。我于一九五二年七月五日离开美国，一九五二年七月九日到达日本板付。一九五二年七月十五日到达朝鲜Ｋ—２基地，被派到第五十八战斗轰炸机大队。在我被击落时，我的职务是驾驶员。我于一九五三年一月十五日在朝鲜新安州被击落并被俘。
    七月十一日在日本板付时，我去听贝克上校的介绍性的谈话。那时他是第五十八战斗轰炸机联队的联队长。他首先欢迎来到大队的新驾驶员，然后他说明了第五十八大队在战斗中的工作，主要是攻击任务，其次是前线支援任务。他说有时在攻击任务中要使用细菌武器。我为我们必须去执行细菌战任务这个事实而震惊。在他结束他的谈话时，他介绍了一个军官给我们，他说这个军官将给我们上一系列的课。
    七月十二日开始上课。我们被分成二组，大约九个或十个驾驶员一组，我记不得讲课者的名字，但在七月十二、十三、十四日下午，我所参加的那个组上了关于细菌战的课。在我一组的驾驶员有：柯蒂斯·卡莱、基德、赖斯多尔夫少尉和我自己，其余五、六人我现在想不起。
    第一课的题目是，为什么美国认为需要使用细菌战。他首先说第五十八大队执行细菌战任务已有好几个月了。在谈到细菌武器被使用的事实的同时，他说这种武器将继续使用，直到获得所期望的结果时为止。他说所有在朝鲜的战斗轰炸机大队都在使用细菌武器，第五十八大队也不例外。如果敌人没有削弱的表现，那继续进行细菌战是肯定的，并且可能在将来还要加强。
    他给我们上的第二课是“细菌战的发展及其历史”。他谈到在第二次世界大战的时候，日本是如何竭力发展一种有效的细菌武器。战后，美国找到一些日本科学家，雇用他们在实验室里继续从事细菌武器的研究和发展。他们在设法改进细菌弹的效力及发现新的和更好的方法来使用和散布细菌和带菌昆虫。他继续说，最初使用的一种细菌弹，体积小，实用上效力不大。接着，他们采用一种五百磅型装有门户的炸弹，这种细菌弹在散布所盛的东西方面，被认为较前一种有效。后来他们发展了一种内装小量炸药的细菌弹。这种炸弹看上去类似五百磅的普通炸弹。试验证明，它较门户型弹更为有效，因为能装更多的细菌液体或带菌昆虫，并且它的爆炸力，可以把所盛的东西散布到更大的地区。这种类型的细菌弹被认为是现有细菌弹中最好的一种，现在已被普遍使用。他说此种弹内所用的昆虫有苍蝇、跳蚤、虱子和蚊子等，这些昆虫所带的细菌有鼠疫、伤寒、霍乱、天花和黄热病等。
    在最后一堂课里，他和我们讲的另一题目是如何使用细菌弹。他说现在携带细菌弹的任务是袭击部队集中地、水源和贮水池，以及截断铁路的任务。向部队集中处投的目的是感染军队和平民，截断铁路任务是感染铁路修筑人员。
    然后，他谈到现在正运用的战术。离目标约近五分钟时，所有的飞机都要从原来的飞行高度下降到九千英尺，约在四千英尺时把炸弹扔下，然后驾驶员应该很快地飞离，重行回到小队，飞返基地。
    上面是尽我记忆所及我在板付所受的有关细菌战的知识。为了保密，在每次讲课结束时，我们被警告不许与任何人谈论此事。
    一九五二年七月十五日，我到达了Ｋ—２基地。我们在驻地安顿下来、领了飞行装备等之后，七月十六日，由夏尔普中校对我们新驾驶员作了一次介绍性的讲话。
    他一开始就介绍第五十八大队的任务，他所讲的与贝克上校在板付所讲过的大致一样。他说，在某些一般任务中我们会发现我们携带细菌弹以代替普通炸弹，他还谈到在目前朝鲜战争中细菌战任务的重要性，并要我们必须按照命令执行。
    在训练飞行的那时期，我上了更多的细菌战的课，时间在一九五二年七月十七日和十八日二天，和我一起参与这些讲课的驾驶员有柯蒂斯·卡莱少尉、麦金尼少尉、布斯丁少尉、基德少尉、基麦尔苏尔少尉、奥勃莱安少尉、罗伯茨少尉、沙芬少尉、赖斯多尔夫少尉、温斯顿·萨梦逊少尉和我自己，其他的人我记不得了。拜昂多中尉给我们讲课。他所讲的细菌战课程，绝大部分是重复的，我们过去都已听过。
    每次讲课之末，他总是提醒我们说，这是秘密资料，不准我们与任何人谈论讲课的内容。
    九月十五日左右，我们小队和其他二个小队被排定执行一次任务。萨利斯柏利中尉是这次任务中我们小队的领队。传达简令时间大约是上午八时。麦尔文·哈特中尉是简令官。他所给的目标是在满洲境内辑安以北约五英里处。他说要萨利斯柏利的小队执行细菌战任务，四架飞机，每架携带二枚细菌弹，其他二小队则带普通炸弹。哈特中尉并说有十二架Ｆ—８６护航，另有二十四架Ｆ—８６将沿鸭绿江巡逻。然后纳希中尉发布情报简令。他说这个目标的性质是鸭绿江北岸的军队集中处，命令规定这次任务携带细菌弹。他还提到为驾驶员击落后所用的当时逃生的情报。然后任务领队华福特上校给予简令。他首先重复了一遍起飞、到达目标上空及检查点的时间。接着他对我们详细谈了这次任务的战术与编队。
    大约在九时四十五分，我们发动引擎起飞。这是我第一次要飞越鸭绿江，所以很紧张。带细菌弹这件事，首先在我内心造成极可怕的感觉。我们按照简令飞向目标，Ｆ—８６型的飞机来了，在离鸭绿江以南五分钟时，我们降低到九千英尺，在四千英尺左右，我投下了我的二枚细菌弹。然后飞离，重返小队，飞返基地着陆后，我们作了标准汇报。最后，我们每人都在标准保密表格上签字。
    十月九日我被排定执行另一次细菌战任务，传达简令时间是在早晨，简令官（我已记不起他的名字）发布他的标准简令，目标是在满洲境内辑安以北约五英里的一个军队集中地。共有十二架飞机受令执行这次任务，每机携带二枚细菌弹。他并说，有二十四架Ｆ—８６沿鸭绿江边巡逻，另有十二架护航。情报官是诺里斯中尉。他告诉我们目标的性质，并强调每一驾驶员需要小心地将炸弹准确地投在目标上。地面联络官和气象官也都作了他们的简令，任务领队夏雷少校接着作了简令。他对我们谈了这次任务所用的队形与战术。我们按简令起飞。在鸭绿江南约五分钟时，我们降低并排成纵队队形。在九千英尺时，我们恢复水平飞行，并调整好电钮，准备投弹。在四千英尺高空，我投了二枚细菌弹，随即飞离，寻找我小队的其余飞机，并会合返航。着陆后，我们作了正规的汇报。在汇报结束时，我们每人须在标准保密表格上签字。执行这次任务的驾驶员为柯林·夏雷少校、勒罗伊·马丁中尉、温斯顿·萨梦逊少尉、詹姆斯·拉鲁中尉和我自己，其余人员我记不起来了。
    十二月二十日我被排定执行我的最后一次细菌战任务。拉鲁中尉是我的小队领队。传达简令在早晨七时左右举行。简令官凯斯曼中尉首先说，这是一次包括切断铁路任务和细菌战任务的混合任务。他告诉我们位置在平壤以南约十五英里处的目标。一共出动三十六架飞机，其中十二架执行细菌战任务。凯斯曼中尉对我们说，拉鲁中尉的小队和其他二个小队带细菌弹。十二架飞机，每架上装二枚，其余二十四架带普通炸弹。接着情报官纳希中尉发布简令。他说任务性质为在此特别延伸处切断铁路，并把细菌弹投在各段被切断的铁路周围。他也提及正确投掷细菌弹的必要性，否则它们的效能便会失去。地面联络官给予目前前线的地面情况。气象官给予简令包括水温及潮水的涨落时间。随后任务领队华福特上校进行他的简令。他重提发动引擎及起飞的时间，以防有些人还不知道。到达目标的时间是上午十时，在途中高度是二万英尺。
    我们约在九时二十分起飞。到达目标区的程序都按照简令进行，一切正常。距目标约五分钟时，我们降低到九千英尺，调整了我们的电钮及投弹瞄准器。然后华福特上校命令进入目标，我们就都跟着进去。在四千英尺高度时，我投下二枚细菌弹，并飞离目标与我的小队集合。在基地着陆后，我们像过去一样地进行汇报。
    据我记忆执行这次任务的驾驶员有华福特上校、施奈德上尉、拉鲁中尉、派特逊少尉、舍豪斯中尉、英格拉姆中尉、米尔少校和我自己，其余人我现在已记不得了。
    在一九五二年八月到一九五三年一月之间，我在北朝鲜和中国共执行过七十一次任务，其中十二次是细菌战任务。除去上述的三次细菌战任务外，另外九次如下：
    约在一九五二年九月六日，我在宣川投掷二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年九月二十二日，我在军隅里投掷细菌弹二枚。
    约在一九五二年十月十三日，我在江界投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十月二十日，我在军隅里投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十月二十八日，我在安州投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十一月四日，我在新安州投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十一月十五日，我在满洲之辑安以北约五英里投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十一月二十九日，我在海州投二枚细菌弹。
    约在一九五二年十二月三日，我在元山投二枚细菌弹。
    我对细菌战是深恶痛绝的，我鄙视自己曾和它有过些关系。当我在板付和Ｋ—２基地逗留期间，我不断地感到精神上的苦恼。继续地使用细菌武器是深深地啃啮我的心，我的良心给我许多烦恼。我犯了大规模屠杀的罪行，全世界善良与爱好和平的人民一定会制止细菌战的进行，并且希望能永远铲除它。我祈求上帝帮助我们改造像今天这样疯狂的混乱的世界，不让我们再尝试做这种事情。
