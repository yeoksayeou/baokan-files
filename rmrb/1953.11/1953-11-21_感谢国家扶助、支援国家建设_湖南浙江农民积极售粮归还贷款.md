Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th: Hunan Province farmers, after enthusiastically selling surplus grain, are actively repaying agricultural loans issued by the government. As of the end of October, the agricultural loans repaid by farmers across the province accounted for 78% of the total issued. The loan recovery work in most areas has entered the clearing stage. This year, farmers in most parts of Hunan Province have achieved a bumper harvest of rice. Agricultural loans have played a significant role in supporting farmers to overcome natural disasters and production difficulties. Farmers in Nan County, located on the banks of Dongting Lake, with the support of government loans, repaired dikes and overcame waterlogging. This year, the county's 600,000+ mu of rice paddies generally increased production by more than 10%. Farmers are grateful to the government and, after enthusiastically selling surplus grain, are actively repaying loans. In ten days, they repaid more than 80% of the county's total agricultural loans. Yang Bihua Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth District used more than 2.9 million yuan in agricultural loans this year to add farming cattle and tools and purchase large quantities of fertilizer, increasing the team's rice paddy production by 15%. Team member Yang Yifen said, "We will never forget the pain of borrowing in the old society, and we will never forget the assistance of the People's Government to us."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Farmers in various parts of Zhejiang Province, after selling surplus grain, are actively repaying national loans on time. According to statistics, from August to October, local People's Banks have successively recovered more than 120 billion yuan in agricultural loans that have matured, accounting for more than 40% of the total loans to be recovered.

　　Farmers in various parts of Zhejiang Province have personally experienced the benefits of the state issuing agricultural loans for their production development. Therefore, they are very active in repaying loans. The Jiangshan District branch of the People's Bank of Yin County recovered more than 200 million yuan in matured loans in four days. Farmers in Miaojiawan Village, Luoxi Township, Yongjia County, paid off all their loans within three days after selling rice. They said: We had great difficulties in production in the first half of the year. The People's Government lent us money at a low interest rate, which provided us with fertilizer, resulting in a larger harvest. Now we must actively return the money to the government.

　　People's Banks in various parts of Zhejiang Province have also adopted many simple methods in the loan recovery work to facilitate farmers' timely repayment of loans. In the work of recovering loans, local People's Banks have given partial or full postponement or installment repayment considerations to farmers who are indeed unable to repay the loans and farmers whose production and life will be difficult after repaying the loans.

    湖南浙江农民积极售粮归还贷款
    【新华社长沙二十日电】湖南省农民在踊跃出售余粮后，主动归还政府发给的农业贷款。截至十月底，全省农民归还的农业贷款已占发放总数百分之七十八。大部地区收贷工作已进入清理阶段。今年，湖南省大部地区农民获得水稻丰收，农业贷款在支持农民战胜自然灾害和克服生产困难中，起了很大的作用。洞庭湖滨的南县农民在政府贷款支持下，修好了堤防，战胜了内涝，今年全县六十多万亩稻田，普遍增产百分之十以上。农民感激政府，踊跃出售余粮后，主动归还贷款。十天中，就归还了全县农业贷款总数百分之八十以上。该县第四区杨必华互助组今年用农业贷款二百九十多万元，增添了耕牛农具，买进了大批肥料，使全组稻田增产百分之十五。组员杨益分说：“我们忘不了旧社会借贷的痛苦，更忘不了人民政府对我们的扶助。”
    【新华社杭州讯】浙江省各地农民纷纷出售余粮后，主动按期归还国家贷款。据统计，自八月份到十月份三个月中，各地人民银行已陆续收回到期农业贷款一千二百多亿元，占应收回贷款总数百分之四十以上。
    浙江省各地农民亲身体验到国家发放农业贷款对他们发展生产的好处，因此，他们归还贷款都很主动。鄞县姜山区人民银行营业所，四天内收回到期贷款二亿多元。永嘉县罗溪乡缪家湾村农民在出售稻谷后的三天内，就还清了全部贷款。他们说：上半年我们生产很困难，人民政府把钱借给我们，利息很轻，使我们有了肥料，结果多打了谷子，现在我们要积极把钱归还政府。
    浙江省各地人民银行在收贷工作中，还采取了许多简便的方法，便利农民及时还贷。在收回贷款工作中，对确实无力还款的农民，以及还贷后生产、生活将发生困难的农民，各地人民银行都分别给予部分或全部缓期，或分期还款的照顾。
