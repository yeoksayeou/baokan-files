    The Dezhou Wholesale Station Should Stop Mail Order Business
    Reader Wang Shutian writes: The report by Comrade Jia Zhansheng published in the People's Daily on October 23rd regarding the Dezhou Department Store Wholesale Station's mail order business is inappropriate. As I understand it, some state-owned department store systems in some areas engaged in mail order business before August. Later, it was discovered that some speculative private merchants were using mail order to purchase certain commodities from state-owned enterprises through "straw buyers," and then selling them on the market at high prices. This not only disrupted the supply plans of state-owned commerce but also caused losses to some consumers. At the same time, mail order business is a kind of cross-regional promotion, which often causes unreasonable transportation and increases circulation costs. This is detrimental to both production and consumption. Therefore, the China Department Store Company has requested and been approved by the Central Ministry of Commerce to notify all department store systems on September 25th to stop mail order business altogether. If the Dezhou Department Store Wholesale Station is still engaged in mail order business, it should stop it soon.
    Editor's Note: Reader Comrade Wang Shutian's opinion on mail order business is correct. It was inappropriate for us to publish Comrade Jia Zhansheng's manuscript without analysis. We suggest that the Dezhou Department Store Wholesale Station immediately implement the notice from the China Department Store Company and stop the mail order business.

### 德州批发站应该停止函购业务

专栏：读者来信摘要

    德州批发站应该停止函购业务
    读者王书田来信：人民日报十月二十三日刊登了贾占升同志关于德州百货批发站开展函购业务的报道是不恰当的。据我了解，八月份以前曾有部分地区的国营百货系统经营函购业务。后来发现有些投机私商利用函购方式向国营企业进行套购某些商品，然后以高价在市场出售。这样，不仅打乱了国营商业的供应计划，而且使一些消费者受到损失。同时，函购业务是一种越区推销的性质，往往造成不合理的运输，增加了流转费用。对生产和消费都很不利。为此，中国百货公司已提请中央商业部批准，于九月二十五日通知各地百货系统一律停止函购业务。德州百货批发站如果仍在经营函购业务，应该很快停止。
    编者按：读者王书田同志对函购业务的意见是正确的。贾占升同志的稿件我们未加分析便予刊登是不妥当的。建议德州百货批发站立即执行中国百货公司的通知，停止函购业务。
