Conscientiously Implement the System of Collective Leadership

As our country enters a new period of economic construction, many aspects of economic work are unfamiliar to Party cadres, and shortcomings and errors in work are inevitable. In order to prevent and correct various shortcomings and errors, we must continue to overcome subjectivism and decentralism in Party work and conscientiously implement the principle of collective leadership in Party committees.

The system of collective leadership means that decisions on all matters of principle must be made on the basis of in-depth study and comprehensive discussion by all leading members, and on the premise of pooling the wisdom of the masses inside and outside the Party. Under the principle of collective leadership, individual patronage and unilateral decision-making are not allowed, and the Party's leadership must be based on the correct foundation of collective leadership. Needless to say, collective leadership is an important foundation for ensuring the unity and solidarity of the Party. Collective leadership makes it easier for the Party to carry out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top, to enhance the initiative and awareness of Party members, and to implement Party supervision over any cadre (regardless of their position). Collective leadership is also a system of collective learning and mutual supervision, because collective leadership can invariably inject the knowledge and experience of all leading members into the collective cause, so that each Party committee member can fully provide their knowledge and experience through the Party committee and absorb the knowledge and experience of others to make up for their own shortcomings, enabling the leadership core to continuously improve. Therefore, collective leadership is the most important principle in the Party's leadership methods, an important method for us to train cadres, and an important condition for ensuring the victory of the revolution.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to the Party's unified leadership and the principle of collective leadership. As early as 1941, at the 20th anniversary of the Party, the Central Committee comprehensively put forward the importance of the Party's unified leadership, unified action, and unified discipline in the "Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit"; on September 1, 1942, the Central Committee's "Decision on Unifying the Party's Leadership in Anti-Japanese Base Areas and Adjusting Relations between Organizations" emphasized the importance of ensuring the Party's unified leadership. In 1948, as the revolution entered a new period of upsurge, the Central Committee issued the "Decision on Improving the Party Committee System," and in order to overcome the phenomenon of decentralism, issued instructions on strictly implementing the system of requesting instructions and reporting. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party Central Committee repeatedly and promptly called on the entire Party to attach importance to the Party's unified leadership and collective leadership, and to prevent the tendency of individualism and decentralism. Obviously, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's consistent and systematic emphasis on the Party's unified leadership and collective leadership has played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the Chinese revolution. Today, as the country enters a period of economic construction, the tasks facing the people and the Party are far more arduous and complex than in the past, and implementing the Party's system of collective leadership is even more necessary than in the past. Therefore, Party committees at all levels should resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao on strengthening the Party's unified leadership and improving the Party committee system, and conscientiously strengthen collective leadership ideologically, institutionally, and methodologically, and do a good job in leadership.

The reason why the system of collective leadership needs to be emphasized repeatedly is that some comrades are often accustomed to making decisions individually, are not accustomed to giving play to the role of collective leadership, are not good at raising important issues to the Party committee for discussion and decision, consciously or unconsciously do not attach importance to collective leadership, and even undermine the Party's principle of collective leadership. For example, in some places, Party committees do not convene Party committee meetings or standing committee meetings for collective discussion on major issues, but are decided solely by the Party secretary. In some places, although Party committee meetings are convened, there is very little preparation for the issues to be discussed, most committee members know nothing before the discussion, there are no formal materials during the discussion, only individual committee members speak, and "resolutions" are made based on this kind of formal "discussion." Some Party committees are afraid of holding meetings, and Party secretaries sometimes use the method of seeking individual opinions to pass important resolutions, which is a violation of democratic principles and a manifestation of unseriousness towards the Party's cause. This both neglects to absorb the experience of all committee members and does not respect the powers of each committee member, weakening the sense of responsibility of each committee member for the Party's major work, and its essence is still individual decision-making. In other cases, some Party committee members do not submit major issues concerning policies and guidelines to the Party committee or standing committee for collective discussion, but make decisions without authorization, often "acting first and reporting later" or "acting without reporting," which is a manifestation of decentralism. Whether the Party secretary or Party committee member individually decides major issues is a violation of the system of collective leadership.

To strengthen the system of collective leadership in Party committees, it is necessary to strengthen the sense of responsibility of Party committee members, and all committee members, especially the standing committee members of the Party committee, should be concerned about all the work of the Party committee. The division of labor among the various committee members of the Party committee is the division of labor under the Party committee system, and the various work departments of the Party are departments under the leadership of the Party committee. If a standing committee member concurrently serves as the head of a department of the Party committee, the responsibilities he should fulfill are not only to do a good job in the work of the department he concurrently serves, but more importantly, to do a good job in the collective leadership work of participating in commanding the overall situation. Some comrades, although they grasp the work of their own department very tightly, can be absent from standing committee meetings without reason, and this phenomenon is undoubtedly wrong. Moreover, to do a good job in a certain department, it is also necessary to work under the unified intention of the Party committee, proceed from the overall situation, carry out work according to unified steps, and combine the work of the department with the overall cause. As a standing committee member of a Party committee, he should not only be a professional who is proficient in the business of a department, but also a skilled political activist who is good at participating in the collective leadership of the overall work. He should require himself to not only be able to take care of partial interests but also be able to take care of the interests of the overall situation, not only be able to pay attention to the current interests of the people but also be able to pay attention to the long-term interests of the people, and be able to combine them well. The correct relationship between the committee members of the Party committee and the Party committee should first of all obey the overall situation, and do a good job of the work assigned in order to do a good job of the overall work. As Chairman Mao taught, "Communists must understand the principle that the needs of the part must be subordinate to the needs of the whole. If a proposal appears feasible from the point of view of a part but not from the point of view of the whole, then the part must give way to the whole. Conversely, too, if a proposal appears infeasible from the point of view of a part but not from the point of view of the whole, then the part must give way to the whole. This is what is meant by taking the whole into account." (Chairman Mao, "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War").

To strengthen the system of collective leadership in Party committees, it is necessary to improve the working system of the Party committee, especially the standing committee itself. The Party committee, especially the standing committee, should periodically make unified arrangements for the various tasks it leads, based on needs and possibilities, put forward a unified and clear center for each period, and at the same time, should take care of the necessary regular work of various departments around this center, and combine them in a planned way. Our Party is a tool of the people's democratic dictatorship, so the Party committee must frequently discuss important issues in the work of the political power. The idea and practice that the Party can relax its leadership over the work of the political power under the pretext of the division of labor between the Party and the government is completely wrong. But on the other hand, there must be an appropriate division of labor between the work of the Party committee and the work of the state organs. The content of Party committee meetings and government meetings should also be appropriately distinguished. The Party's leadership over the work of the political power should focus on the main and important principles, policies and plans, and should not take over everything. All issues should not be raised to the Party committee meetings. Party committee meetings should be fully prepared before the meeting, and written materials and written opinions that have been fully studied, or draft resolutions on this work, should be issued first to help each committee member prepare well before the meeting; for complex issues and important issues with divergent opinions, individual consultations should be held first so that each committee member is mentally prepared, so as not to make the meeting a formality or fail to make a decision. The form of the meeting should be as simple as possible to facilitate in-depth study of the issues; meetings that can be avoided should be avoided as much as possible, the duration of each meeting should not be too long, the number of meetings should not be too frequent, and one should not indulge in the discussion of minor issues. After discussion, the issues on the agenda should have clear conclusions and formal resolutions, and the personnel responsible for handling them and the deadline for completion should be decided in order to check the implementation. If this is not the case, but there is no preparation beforehand, and people only talk about their feelings at the meeting, the number of meetings is numerous and chaotic, the content of the meetings is not distinguished and limited, people talk about everything under the sun, and there are no clear resolutions at the meetings, then such meetings will certainly not achieve the purpose of collective leadership.

Of course, implementing collective leadership does not mean canceling the division of labor and individual responsibility. On the contrary, the individual responsibility of each committee member should be strengthened. Improving the Party committee system does not mean that all issues should be brought up at the meeting for resolution, and the system of individual responsibility or individual consultation among Party committee members for handling daily work should also be implemented for issues that should be divided and responsible. Where possible, a collective office system for the standing committee members of the Party committee can also be established outside of the Party committee meetings, and daily affairs can be resolved through the collective office method, which not only avoids the problem of delaying time by transmitting documents, but also enables standing committee members to frequently exchange information and maintain a consistent pace. In short, necessary working systems should be established in all aspects to strengthen collective leadership.

To strengthen the Party's system of collective leadership, it is also necessary to strengthen criticism and self-criticism. If the Party committee is to truly play the role of the leadership core, it must take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. This is not only necessary for the realization of the Party's collective leadership, but also very necessary for improving the political level of the Party committee members. The Party secretary must pay attention to the opinions of each committee member, and do his best to encourage and support criticism from all sides. Party committee members should frequently listen to the opinions of Party members, the masses, and lower-level cadres on him in order to improve leadership. In some places, Party committees, due to the lack of criticism and self-criticism, have given individualists an opportunity to take advantage of. They use a decentralized state to act independently, undermining the Party committee's unified leadership, and even attempt to replace the Party committee's collective leadership with individual leadership, and use the department they preside over to confront the Party committee leadership, not implementing the Party committee's decisions, and not allowing the Party committee to interfere in the work of the department they preside over, so that the Party's policies cannot be implemented, the Party's line cannot be realized, and the Party's prestige is greatly damaged. Therefore, improving the Party committee system must resolutely struggle against this kind of individualism, and systematically educate cadres to consciously obey the overall interests of the Party and obey the Party's discipline.

Party committees at all levels must constantly strive to implement the system of collective leadership, so that the leadership level of our entire Party is universally improved, and the Party's combat effectiveness is further enhanced, in order to complete the great historical task of the transition period.

### 认真贯彻集体领导制

    认真贯彻集体领导制
    由于我们的国家进入了经济建设新时期，经济建设的许多工作对于党的干部是生疏的，工作上难免会发生缺点和错误。为了防止和纠正各种缺点和错误，我们必须继续在党的工作中克服主观主义和分散主义倾向，认真贯彻党委会中的集体领导的原则。
    集体领导制就是说，一切原则性问题的决定，必须是在全体领导成员深刻研究和全面讨论的基础上作出的，是在集中党内外群众智慧的前提下作出的。在集体领导的原则之下，不能允许个人包办代替和片面决定问题，而必须使党的领导建立在集体领导的正确基础上面。不言而喻，集体领导是保证党的团结和统一的重要基础。集体领导使党便于从上而下和从下而上地开展批评和自我批评，提高党员积极性和觉悟性，并且对任何一个干部（不论其职位高低）实行党的监督。集体领导也是集体学习、互相监督的制度，因为集体领导能无例外地把全体领导成员的知识和经验投入集体事业中，使每个党委委员通过党委会充分提供自己的知识和经验，同时吸取别人的知识和经验，以补自己的不足，使领导核心能不断获得进步。因此，集体领导是党的领导方法中的头等重要的原则，是我们培养干部的重要方法，是保证革命胜利的重要条件。
    党中央和毛主席一向是十分重视党的统一领导和集体领导原则的。远在一九四一年党的二十周年纪念时，中央在“关于增强党性的决定”中，就曾全面地提出了党的统一领导、统一行动、统一纪律的重要性；一九四二年九月一日中央“关于统一抗日根据地党的领导及调整各组织间关系的决定”中又着重指出了保证党的领导一元化的重要性。一九四八年革命进入新的高涨时期，中央又发布了“健全党委制的决定”，并且为了克服分散主义现象，发布了严格执行请示报告制度的指示。中华人民共和国成立后，党中央又迭次及时地号召全党重视党的统一领导和集体领导，防止个人主义和分散主义的倾向。很明显，党中央和毛主席一贯地、系统地重视党的统一领导和集体领导，对于保证中国革命胜利具有重大的作用。今天国家进入经济建设时期，摆在全国人民和党面前的任务远比过去繁重而复杂，贯彻党的集体领导制度也比过去更为必要。因此，各级党委应坚决贯彻中央和毛主席关于加强党的统一领导健全党委制的指示，认真从思想上、制度上、工作方法上加强集体领导，做好领导工作。
  　集体领导制之所以需要经常反复强调，是因为有些同志常常习惯于个人决定问题，不习惯于发挥集体领导的作用，不善于把重要的问题提到党委会上讨论和决定，自觉地或不自觉地不重视集体领导，甚至破坏了党的集体领导原则。例如有的地方党委会对重大问题，不召开党委会议或党委的常委会进行集体讨论，仅仅由党委书记决定。有的地方虽然召开党委会议，但对讨论的问题准备很少，多数委员在讨论以前一无所知，讨论时也没有正式材料，只有个别的委员发言，随即根据这种形式的 “讨论”作出“决议”。有的党委因为怕开会，党委书记有时用个别征求意见的办法通过重要决议，这是违反民主原则的，是对党的事业不严肃的表现，这样既忽视吸取全体委员的经验，也不尊重各个委员职权，削弱了各委员对党的重大工作的责任感，其实质仍然是个人决定问题。在其他情况下，有的党委委员对一些关于政策方针的重大问题也不交党委会或常委会集体讨论，就擅自决定，常常 “先斩后奏”或“斩而不奏”，这是分散主义的表现。无论党委书记或党委委员个人决定重大问题都是破坏集体领导制的。
    加强党委会中的集体领导制必须加强党委委员的责任心，要全体委员特别是党委的常务委员关心党委的全部工作。党委会各个委员的分工是党委制下的分工，党的各个工作部门是党委领导下的部门。如果某一常务委员是兼任党委某一部的部长的话，他应当尽到的职责，就不只是应该作好他所兼任的那一个部的部门工作，更重要的是应该作好参与指挥全局的集体领导工作。有些同志对本部的工作虽然抓得很紧，对常委的会议却可以无故缺席，这种现象无疑是错误的。而且，要作好某一部门的工作，也必须在党委统一的意图下，从全局出发，按统一的步骤进行工作，并把部门的工作与全局事业结合起来。作为一个党委的常务委员，不仅是精通一个部门业务的专业人员，还应是善于参与全局工作的集体领导的熟练的政治活动家。他应当要求自己不仅能照顾到部分利益又能照顾到全局的利益，不仅能注意到人民的当前利益又能注意到人民的长远利益，并能很好地把它们结合起来。党委的委员与党委的正确关系，首先应当服从全局，在一切为了作好全局工作的前提下去作好分工所负的工作。应当如毛主席所教导的“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。如果某项意见在局部的情形看来是可行的，而在全局的情形看来是不可行的，就应以局部服从全局。反之也是一样，在局部的情形看来是不可行的，而在全局的情形看来是可行的，也应以局部服从全局。这就是照顾全局的观点。”（毛主席“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）
    加强党委会中的集体领导制必须健全党委会特别是常委会本身的工作制度。党委会特别是常委会应当按期对自己所领导的各项工作，根据需要和可能统一安排，每一时期要提出统一的明确的中心，同时又应围绕这一中心照顾各部门必要的经常工作，并有计划地把它们结合起来。我们的党是人民民主专政的工具，因此党委必须经常讨论政权工作中的重要问题，那种借口党政分工而认为党可以放松对政权工作的领导的想法和作法是完全错误的。但是在另一方面，党委的工作和政权机关的工作又必须有适当的分工。党委的会议和政府会议的内容也应有适当的区分，党对政权工作的领导，应当集中于主要和重要的方针、政策和计划，而不应当包办代替，把一切问题都提到党委会议上来。党委的会议在会前要有充分准备，要先发出经过充分研究过的书面材料和书面意见，或是关于这一工作的决议草案，以便帮助各委员在会前能作很好的准备；对复杂的问题以及有分歧意见的重要问题，又须先有个别商谈，使各委员有思想准备，以免会议流于形式或做不出决定。会议的形式应力求简单，以便于深入研究问题；可开可不开的会尽量不开，每次会的时间不可太长，会议的次数不可太频繁，不可沉溺于细小问题的讨论。列入议程的问题，讨论后要有明确的结论和正式的决议，要决定负责主办的人员和完成的期限，以便检查执行。如果不是这样，而是事前并不准备，到会上临时谈感想，会议的次数多而又乱，会议的内容没有区分和限制，东拉西扯，会议没有明确的决议，那么，这样的会议当然达不到集体领导的目的。
    当然，实行集体领导，绝不是取消分工领导和个人负责。相反的，应加强每个委员的个人责任。健全党委制并不是说任何问题都要提到会议上解决，应该分工负责的问题也应贯彻个人负责或者党委委员之间的各别商量处理日常工作的制度。在可能条件下，党委会议之外，还可建立党委常务委员的集体办公制度，可通过集体办公方式来解决日常事务，这不仅避免传递文件延误时间的毛病，又能使常务委员间经常交流情况，步调一致。总之，应从各方面建立必要的工作制度，以加强集体领导。
    加强党的集体领导制还要加强批评和自我批评。党委会要真正起领导核心作用，必须以身作则进行批评和自我批评。这不仅为了实现党的集体领导所必需，为了提高党委委员的政治水平也十分需要。党委书记必须注意每一委员的意见，尽力鼓励和支持来自每一方面的批评，党委委员要经常听取党员群众和下级干部对他的意见，借以改善领导。有的地方党委会由于缺乏批评和自我批评，给个人主义者钻了空子，他们利用分散状态各自为政，破坏党委的统一领导，甚至企图以个人领导代替党委的集体领导，并以自己所主持的部门和党委领导分庭抗礼，不执行党委决定，并不允许党委插手他所主持的部门工作，使党的政策不能贯彻，党的路线不能实现，党的威信大受损害。因此，健全党委制必须坚决向这种个人主义进行斗争，有系统地教育干部自觉地服从党的整体利益，服从党的纪律。
    各级党委必须时刻努力贯彻集体领导制，使我们全党的领导水平普遍提高，使党的战斗性更加增强，以便完成过渡时期的伟大的历史任务。
