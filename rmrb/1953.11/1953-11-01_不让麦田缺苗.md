    Do Not Allow Wheat Fields to Lack Seedlings
    During this year's wheat planting season, the land was dry, and insect pests were severe after planting, resulting in missing seedlings and broken rows in wheat fields in most areas. Some areas have already carried out replanting and seedling protection work, but cadres and the masses in some other areas mistakenly believe that "dense fields and sparse fields yield the same amount of grain," "missing seedlings in wheat fields are not a big deal," or that "wheat fields are difficult to replant," and therefore take a negative attitude towards replanting work.
    Do dense fields and sparse fields yield the same amount of grain? Many facts refute this idea. The densely planted wheat that was trialed in various places this year generally increased in yield; the reason why densely planted wheat yields were much higher than wide-row sparsely planted wheat is mainly due to the larger number of seedlings. Cadres in Wangting Township, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, calculated the accounts based on the township's wheat harvest this year: a 10% lack of seedlings results in approximately one *dou* less wheat harvested per *mu*; calculating based on the township's four thousand *mu* of wheat fields, this equals a loss of four hundred *shi*. Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, calculated that with a 15% seedling deficiency rate across the county's 780,000 *mu* of wheat fields, this is equivalent to 117,000 *mu* of wheat fields not being planted; if these fields yielded 110 *jin* of wheat per *mu*, the reduction in wheat yield would be more than 12 million *jin*.
    Is it easy to replant wheat fields? The replanting experience in some areas this year has proven that it is not only easy to replant, but the replanted seedlings also emerge very well. Although it is past "Frost's Descent," replanting can still be carried out vigorously where climatic conditions permit. However, when replanting, it is necessary to devise appropriate countermeasures based on the reasons for the missing seedlings. For example, for seedling deficiencies caused by drought, the drought problem must be solved; for seedling deficiencies caused by insect pests, measures must be taken to prevent the insects from continuing to cause harm.
    In areas where wheat field pests are severe, efforts should be made to eliminate the pests while actively replanting. Because without thoroughly eliminating the pests, not only are the wheat seedlings that have not been destroyed likely to continue to be destroyed, but even the newly replanted seedlings may not be preserved. Some areas with severe insect pests are only busy replanting and neglect pest control, which is wrong.
    Ensuring full seedlings is an important experience for increasing wheat production in various regions. In order to strive for increased wheat production next year, we should actively protect wheat fields from now on and prevent wheat seedlings from being damaged again.

### 不让麦田缺苗

    不让麦田缺苗
    今年小麦播种期间土地干旱，播种后虫害严重，多数地区的麦田都有缺苗断条的现象。部分地区已经进行了补种和保苗工作，但是还有一些地区的干部和群众错误地认为“稠田稀田打粮一样”“麦田缺苗不算什么”，或者认为“麦田不好补种”，因此对补种工作抱着消极的态度。
    稠田稀田一样打粮吗？许多事实对这个问题的答复都是否定的。今年各地试种的密植小麦普遍的增产了；密植麦的产量所以比宽垄稀植麦高出很多，主要原因就是苗多苗全。河北省清苑县望亭乡干部曾以该乡今年麦收的情况算了一下细账：缺一成苗每亩地大约少收一斗麦子，以全乡四千亩麦田计算，就少收四百石。山西省闻喜县以全县七十八万亩麦田百分之十五的缺苗率计算，等于十一万七千亩麦田没有下种；这些麦田以每亩收麦一百一十斤计算，就少收小麦一千二百多万斤。
    麦田好不好补种？今年一些地区补种的经验证明，不但好补种，而且补种的都出苗很好。目前虽已过了“霜降”，但在一些气候条件许可的地方，还可以抓紧时机大力进行补种。不过在补种时一定要根据缺苗的原因，想出适当的对付办法。比如因干旱缺苗的就要解决干旱问题；因虫害缺苗的就要防止虫子继续为害。
    在麦田害虫严重的地区，与积极补种的同时，还要努力除治害虫。因为不彻底除治害虫，不仅没有被毁的麦苗有继续被毁的可能，就是重新补种的也不一定保得住。有一些虫害严重的地区只是忙于补种而忽视除虫，是不对的。
    保证全苗是各地小麦增产重要的一项经验。为了争取明年小麦增产，就应该从现在起积极保护麦田，不使麦苗再受损害。
