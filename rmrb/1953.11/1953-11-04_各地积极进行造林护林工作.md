    Various Regions Actively Carry Out Afforestation and Forest Protection Work

    [By Our Newspaper] Now is one of the most suitable seasons for afforestation and the most critical for forest protection. Various regions are actively carrying out autumn afforestation and forest protection work. After the Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau issued a notice on autumn afforestation work, forestry departments in various parts of Northeast China discussed the tasks and specific methods for autumn afforestation. Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaoxi, and other provinces have formulated their autumn afforestation tasks: Heilongjiang: to afforest 4,845 hectares, replant 2,933 hectares, artificially transplant seedlings 498 hectares, and artificially direct sow 231 hectares; Songjiang: to cultivate 87,600 mu of resource forests in twenty-three counties including Shuangcheng, Hulan, Bayan, and Fujin; Liaoxi: to complete the afforestation of 10,677.9 hectares and replant 4,225 hectares before the ground freezes. Rehe Province originally planned to plant 220,000 mu of trees this autumn, but now it seems that it can be overfulfilled due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. In order to complete this year's annual afforestation plan, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also issued an outline of autumn afforestation work to various banners and counties, giving instructions on autumn afforestation, seed collection, and seedling cultivation. Hebei Province is actively carrying out oak and quercus seed sowing and afforestation work, which is of great value to industrial and agricultural production. Suiyuan Province has held a forestry work conference to determine the central tasks of this autumn's afforestation and forest protection work. Currently, leading cadres in Ulanqab League, Suidong Joint Banner, and Siziwang Banner are providing specific leadership for autumn forestry work. The land and seedlings for afforestation and seedling cultivation in various places have been basically prepared and are beginning to enter the stage of organizing labor and construction. Oak seed sowing is underway in Daqingshan. Gansu Province, Xinjiang Province, Yulin Special Zone of Shaanxi Province, Suide Special Zone in the Northwest Region, Shandong Province, Huizhou Special Zone in Anhui Province in the East China Region, and Henan Province and Jiangxi Province in the Central South Region have all begun their autumn afforestation and forest protection work. Autumn aerial patrols in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia began in mid-September.

    Since the State Council issued instructions on September 30 regarding mobilizing the masses to carry out afforestation, tree cultivation, and forest protection work, various regions are further examining some shortcomings in past work based on these instructions and discussing specific methods for improving the work. Various regions have also gained a lot of new work experience in afforestation and forest protection work in the first half of the year. Many places have formulated plans that unify forestry work and agricultural production, so that they can cooperate and not hinder each other. For example, the Tumote Banner in Fuxin County, Liaoxi, held a joint meeting of mutual aid team leaders to arrange spring plowing and afforestation work, and made specific arrangements based on the labor situation, so that afforestation and spring plowing were not delayed. The phenomenon of antagonism between agriculture and forestry in Rehe, Ningxia, and Gansu has been greatly reduced. Various regions have also cleared up shares in cooperative afforestation and consolidated the organizations for cooperative afforestation. Through the promotion of policies and the transmission of technology, cadres' understanding of forestry work and technical knowledge has also improved compared with the past. These are all favorable conditions for this autumn's afforestation and forest protection.

    In arranging this autumn's afforestation and forest protection work, various regions have generally paid attention to closely integrating forestry construction with agricultural production. The Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau pointed out in its autumn afforestation notice: Autumn afforestation is during the busy farming season, and various regions must formulate practical afforestation plans based on local conditions, which should be reviewed and discussed by the government, uniformly arranged, and combined with agricultural production to do a good job in autumn afforestation. In order to enable afforestation work to be carried out extensively, in addition to vigorously publicizing and implementing afforestation policies, it is necessary to advocate and support private operations by the masses to collect, cultivate, plant, and protect trees themselves; on the other hand, agricultural mutual aid groups and production cooperatives should be mobilized to cooperate in afforestation in a planned and led manner based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. The Heilongjiang Provincial Autumn Forestry Work Conference determined that in the future, the policy of combining afforestation and forest protection with agricultural production and combining national interests with the interests of the peasants must be implemented in forestry construction. The instructions of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government stipulate: It is necessary to combine mountain closure and forest cultivation work with the organization of sideline production for the masses in mountainous disaster areas, such as cutting brambles, gathering dead branches, and cutting grass in open areas, and organizing the masses to clean up and cultivate forests in a planned manner in closed areas to solve the problem of firewood and wood for some small farm tools. However, it is necessary to prevent a purely disaster relief point of view, so as not to form destructive behavior.

    Various regions have also generally attached importance to strengthening technical guidance for afforestation and improving the survival rate of seedlings in arranging autumn afforestation. The Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau emphasized in its notice on doing a good job in autumn afforestation: This autumn's afforestation in various regions should aim at improving the survival rate of afforestation, strengthening quality inspection, and eliminating waste of manpower and seedlings. Attention should be paid to the continuity of the afforestation process, and preparations for pre-afforestation land selection, labor organization, and seedling supply should be strengthened, and seedlings and seeds should be strictly selected; land preparation should also be done well. In addition to pointing out that it is necessary to do a good job in selecting tree species, preparing land for irrigation, and purchasing and transporting seedlings and seeds in advance, the instructions of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government on autumn afforestation and forest protection work also propose that it is necessary to strengthen frost prevention work in winter and spring to achieve the goal of "ensuring planting and survival, and planting trees to form forests." Many places in Henan Province have paid attention to drawing on past experiences and lessons and improving afforestation techniques in autumn afforestation work. For example, Jiyuan County has held two training classes for afforestation personnel, exchanged experiences, and learned techniques; farmers in Xujiatai Township, Linru County, collectively studied and experimented before sowing, and found a way to preserve moisture, prevent insects, and improve the survival rate of seedlings. The People's Congress of all walks of life in Xinghe County, Suiyuan Province, also discussed afforestation and forest protection work; the Ma Wuhuan mutual aid team in Shuiduotela Township also put forward the "five good" slogan of "good land selection, good seedling preparation, good labor organization, good survival, and good protection" to ensure the completion of the afforestation plan and ensure the improvement of the tree survival rate.

    各地积极进行造林护林工作
    【本报讯】现在正是最适宜造林、最需要护林的季节之一，各地正积极进行秋季造林护林工作。东北行政委员会林业局发出了关于秋季造林工作的通知以后，东北各地林业工作部门都讨论了秋季造林的任务和具体办法。黑龙江、松江、辽西等省分别订出今秋营造的任务：黑龙江：造林四千八百四十五公顷，补植二千九百三十三公顷，人工移苗四百九十八公顷，人工直播二百三十一公顷；松江：在双城、呼兰、巴彦、富锦等二十三个县境内营造资源林八万七千六百亩；辽西：要求结冻前完成造林一万零六百七十七点九公顷，补植四千二百二十五公顷。热河省原计划秋季植树二十二万亩，现在看来，由于群众造林积极性的提高，可以超额完成。内蒙古自治区人民政府为了完成今年全年造林计划，也向各旗县发出今年秋季造林工作提纲，对秋季造林、采种和育苗等工作分别作了指示。河北省正积极进行对于工业农业生产都有重要价值的橡栎播种造林工作，绥远省已举行了林业工作会议，确定了今秋造林、护林工作的中心任务。现在乌兰察布盟、绥东联合旗、四子王旗领导干部都对秋季林业工作进行了具体领导，各地造林育苗的土地、苗条等基本上都已准备妥善，开始进入组织劳力和施工阶段；大青山正在进行橡籽播种。西北区的甘肃省、新疆省、陕西榆林专区、绥德专区，华东区的山东省、安徽徽州专区，中南区的河南省、江西省，今秋的造林护林工作都已开始进行。东北、内蒙古的秋季航空巡护工作已于九月中旬开始。
    九月三十日政务院关于发动群众开展造林育林护林工作的指示发出以后，各地正根据这个指示进一步检查过去工作中的一些缺点，讨论改进工作的具体办法。各地在上半年造林护林工作中也取得了不少新的工作经验。很多地方把林业工作和农业生产统一订定计划，使之互相配合，互不妨碍。如辽西阜新县土默特旗召开互助组长联席会，安排春耕和造林工作，按劳力情况具体布置，做到了造林春耕两不误。热河、宁夏、甘肃等地农林对立的现象都大为减少。各地还清理了合作造林的股票，巩固了合作造林的组织。经过宣传政策，传授技术，干部对林业工作的认识和技术知识也比过去提高了。这些都是今年秋季造林护林的有利条件。
    各地在布置今年秋季造林护林工作中，普遍注意到了使林业建设与农业生产紧密结合。东北行政委员会林业局在秋季造林通知中指出：秋季造林正值农忙季节，各地必须根据地区情况，制订切实可行的造林计划，经政府审查讨论，统一布置，结合农业生产做好秋季造林工作。为使造林工作能够广泛地开展，各地除应大力宣传和贯彻造林政策外，必须一方面提倡与扶助群众自采、自育、自造、自护的私人经营方式；另方面，要本自愿互利原则，有计划，有领导地发动农业互助组和生产合作社合作造林。黑龙江省秋季林业工作会议中确定：今后在林业建设上必须贯彻造林护林和农业生产相结合、国家利益和农民群众利益相结合的方针。绥远省人民政府的指示中规定：要结合封山育林工作，组织山林灾区群众的副业生产，如在开放区割荆条、打枯枝、打草，在封禁区组织群众有计划地清理抚育山林，解决烧柴及部分小农具用材的问题。但必须防止单纯救灾观点，以免形成破坏行为。
    各地在布置秋季造林中还普遍重视了加强造林技术指导、提高苗木的成活率。东北行政委员会林业局在关于做好秋季造林工作的通知中着重指出：各地今秋造林应以提高造林成活率，加强质量检查，消灭人工、苗木损失浪费为奋斗目标。要注意造林工作过程的连续性，对造林前的林地选择、劳力组织、秧苗供应等准备工作要格外加强，对苗木、种籽要严格选择；整地工作也要做好。绥远省人民政府在关于秋季造林护林工作的指示中除指出必须事先做好选定树种、整地灌水、采购调运苗木籽种等工作外，还提出必须加强冬春两季的防冻工作，以达到“保栽保活、植树成林”的目的。河南省许多地方在秋季造林工作中注意到了吸取往年的经验和教训，改进造林技术。如：济源县曾举办两个造林人员训练班，交流了经验，学习了技术；临汝县许家台乡农民在播种前集体研究试验，找出了保墒防虫提高树苗成活率的办法。绥远省兴和县各界人民代表会议也讨论了造林护林工作；水道特拉乡马五换互助组还提出了“土地选择好、树苗准备好、劳力组织好、成活好、保护好”的“五好”口号，保证完成造林计划，保证提高树木成活率。
