    The Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum in Beijing Officially Opens
    Displaying Over 500 Famous Chinese Paintings from the Sui, Tang to Ming and Qing Dynasties
    Over the past four years, the Social Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has diligently collected classical Chinese paintings from various dynasties. They have carefully selected over 500 masterpieces from the Sui, Tang to Ming and Qing dynasties and arranged them in a painting gallery at the Palace Museum in Beijing. This treasure trove of classical Chinese art will officially open on November 1st.
    The Painting Gallery displays outstanding works of various schools of painters in chronological order: the Hall of Supreme Harmony displays ancient paintings from the Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Northern and Southern Song dynasties; the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is a special room for Yuan dynasty paintings; the East and West Wing Halls exhibit a rich variety of Ming and Qing dynasty paintings. The great tradition of Chinese art shines brightly in the magnificent ancient architecture.
    The ancient paintings in the Hall of Supreme Harmony are the first to attract visitors. Zhan Ziqian's "Spring Outing," from the Sui Dynasty, is the oldest existing famous painting in China. The painting expresses "within a small space, the interest of a thousand miles" and the depiction of landscapes and the mental state of the characters are harmoniously integrated. "Ladies with Fan" and Han Huang's "Literary Gathering" vividly depict the lives of people in the Tang Dynasty. Gu Hongzhong's "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" and Wei Xian's "High Scholar" are masterpieces of the Five Dynasties. The postures of the performers depicted in "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" make one seem to hear the music playing to a certain beat. The Song Dynasty was the mature period of Chinese painting art, and there are many excellent works. "Hundred Horses" and Li Gonglin's "Herding" are full of life and power, and are the most exquisite sketches. Zhao Ji's "Listening to the Qin" is a model for concentrating on the theme. Not only do the characters' postures reflect the melodious sound of the zither, but even the pine trees seem to be listening quietly. Ma Yuan and Xia Gui used the method of focal perspective. In Ma Yuan's "Song of Triumph," the joy of the working people vividly appears on the paper, and "Water Album" captures the rules of various kinds of flowing water. The most prominent in this exhibition room are Zhang Zeduan's "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and Wang Ximeng's "A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains." The former painting depicts the bustling crowds in the countryside and cities and their rich and diverse lives with beautiful and leisurely composition and layout, which is not only of artistic value but also of historical value. The latter painting depicts distant mountains, nearby waters, fishing boats, passenger ships, and even figures and birds, all meticulously depicted, and is representative of the best landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty court. Liang Shimin's "Dense Snow on Reed Bank" uses brush and ink to create a cold atmosphere, and Liang Kai's "Autumn Willows and Two Crows" uses concise techniques to express a complete artistic conception, both of which are unique works. In addition, Li Di's "Chicks," Li Song's "Flower Basket," "Red Smartweed and Waterfowl," and "Lotus Emerging from Water," etc., are all vivid and beautiful, showcasing the utmost skill in sketching.
    Among the Yuan Dynasty paintings displayed in the gallery, representative works include Zhao Mengfu's "Autumn Outing and Drinking Horses" and Zhao Mengfu and Guan Daosheng's collaborative "Ink Bamboo." The "Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty," Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Wu Zhen, and Ni Zan, enriched the painting techniques of dry brushstrokes and light ink rendering. Their landscape paintings are simple, elegant, profound and beautiful. Works by all four masters are on display, with Huang Gongwang's "Snowy Peaks After Clearing" being the most outstanding, showing the originality of painters who base their work on sketching in the use of concise brushwork.
    The Ming Dynasty painting established a unique style when the "Four Masters of the Ming Dynasty," Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming (Wen Bi), Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying, appeared on the art scene. The Painting Gallery displays many paintings by these four masters and other artists of the Wu School. Shen Zhou's eight-page "Miscellaneous Paintings" have vigorous and graceful brushstrokes, and the pictures are full of vitality and spirit, creating a unique style of flower and bird painting in the Ming Dynasty. Tang Yin's "Wind and Wood" fully expresses the theme of "the tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop, the son wants to support but the parents are not there," and the description of the background and the emotions of the characters resonate. In the late Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang advocated techniques, which influenced the painting style of the Qing Dynasty. Examples are also on display. Xu Wei's "Seeking Poetry on a Donkey's Back" has a unique artistic conception and painting method, and does not fall into stereotypes. Chen Hongshou's several figure paintings also have a strong personality.
    The Qing Dynasty paintings displayed in the Painting Gallery can be roughly divided into three aspects: the paintings of the Ming Dynasty loyalists and the "Four Wangs, Wu, and Yun" and the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." Among the paintings of the Ming Dynasty loyalists, Zhu Da's "Ink Lotus and Water Birds" is the most eye-catching. This painting is not bound by established methods and fully expresses the characteristics of lotus flowers and water birds. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, and Wang Yuanqi were skilled in techniques and good at imitating ancient paintings. Afterwards, imitating the ancients became the general trend among Qing Dynasty painters. What is refreshing in Qing Dynasty paintings are Yun Shouping's (號南田) several flower paintings and Hua Yan's eight flower and bird paintings, both of which are individual and distinctive. Amidst the trend of imitating the ancients, what advocated creation, uniquely expressing personality, and refreshing people's eyes and ears are the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou" and their disciples. The Painting Gallery displays Jin Nong's "Plum Blossoms," Zheng Xie's "Ink Bamboo," Li Shan's "Pine and Wisteria," and Luo Ping's "Flowers and Birds," etc., which fully demonstrate this point.
    The masterpieces of art displayed in the Painting Gallery prove that truly beautiful works of art can be immortal, and also prove the greatness of the Chinese art tradition and the excellence and richness of cultural heritage. The opening of the Painting Gallery has created conditions for studying classical Chinese art and thus promoting the new through the old. What is especially important is that the famous paintings of past dynasties, originally hidden in the deep palace courtyards, are now collected and preserved by the state, becoming the precious property of the whole people, and are publicly exhibited, so that everyone can approach the brilliant art heritage, thereby receiving art education and patriotic education.
    After the preparation of the Painting Gallery was completed, a preview was held.
    Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De and Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, Secretary General of the Central People's Government Lin Boqu, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council Guo Moruo, Secretary General of the Government Administration Council Xi Zhongxun, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Deputy Ministers Zhou Yang and Ding Xilin, and about 2,000 people including famous artists and writers in the capital, as well as all representatives of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, visited the exhibition and praised it unanimously. The establishment and opening of the Painting Gallery is regarded as an unprecedented event in the history of Chinese art.

    北京故宫博物院绘画馆正式开放
    陈列着我国从隋唐到明清的名画五百多件
    中 央人民政府文化部社会文化事业管理局四年来辛勤搜集我国历代古典名画，精选了从隋唐到明清的杰作五百多件，在北京故宫博物院布置了一所绘画馆。这个中国古典美术的宝库，将在十一月一日正式开放。
    绘画馆按照时代顺序和画家的流派，陈列各家的优秀作品：故宫皇极殿布满了隋、唐、五代和南北宋的古画，宁寿宫是元代绘画的专室，东西庑殿展出了丰富多样的明清画。我国艺术的伟大传统，在瑰丽的古建筑中发出灿烂的光辉。
    首先吸引人的是皇极殿里的古画。隋朝展子虔的“游春图”是国内现存最古的名画。画中表现了“咫尺之中，备千里之趣”，而且山水的描绘与人物的精神状态得到了融洽无间的表现。“纨扇仕女图”和韩滉的“文苑图”栩栩如生地描绘了唐代人物的生活。顾闳中的“韩熙载夜宴图”和卫贤的“高士图”是五代的杰作。“韩熙载夜宴图”里所描绘的演奏的姿态，叫人仿佛听到这乐曲正奏到某一个节拍上。宋代是我国绘画艺术的成熟时期，好的作品非常多。“百马图”和李公麟的“牧放图”气象万千，充满了生命和力量，是最精湛的素描。赵佶的“听琴图”是集中地表现主题的范本，不仅人物的姿态体现了琴声的悠扬，仿佛松树也在静听。马远、夏圭运用了焦点透视的画法。马远的“踏歌图”里劳动人民的欢乐跃然出现在纸上，“水图”掌握住了各种各样流水的规律。这一展览室中最突出的是张择端的“清明上河图”和王希孟的“千里江山图”。前一卷画以美丽而从容的构图和布局，描写了乡村和城市的熙熙攘攘的人们和他们的丰富多样的生活，不仅具有艺术价值，而且具有历史价值。后一卷画描画远山、近水、渔艇、客船，乃至人物、飞鸟，无不精心刻划，是宋代院画中最好的山水画的代表作。梁师闵的“芦汀密雪图”用笔墨烘托出寒冷的气氛，梁楷的“秋柳双鸦图”用精炼的手法表现出完整的意境，也都是独到之作。此外如李迪的“鸡雏图”、李嵩的“花篮图”以及“红蓼水禽图”、“出水芙蓉图”等等，都是又生动又美丽，极尽写生之能事。
    馆内所陈列的元代绘画里，代表性的作品有赵孟頫的“秋郊饮马图”，赵孟頫和管道昇合作的“墨竹图”，任仁发的“二骏图”。元末四大家黄公望、王蒙、吴镇、倪瓒丰富了渴笔皴擦、淡墨渲染的画法，所作山水画简淡高逸，苍茫深秀。四家作品都有陈列，尤以黄公望的“九峰雪霁图”最为出色，可以看出以写生为基础的画家在运用简炼的笔法上的独创性。
    明代绘画树立起独特的风格，是在沈周、文征明（文璧）、唐寅、仇英四家出现在画坛的时候。绘画馆陈列这四家以及吴门派其他作家的画很多。沈周的八页“杂画”笔法刚健婀娜，画面元气磅礴，精神饱满，开创了明代花鸟画独特的风格。唐寅的 “风木图”充分表现了“树欲静而风不止，子欲养而亲不待”的主题，背景的描写和人物的情绪起着共鸣。晚明的画，董其昌提倡技法，影响了清代一代的画风，亦有标本陈列。徐渭的“驴背寻诗图”，意境和画法都自成一格，不落窠臼。陈洪绶的几幅人物画，也具有强烈的个性。
    绘画馆所陈列的清代画，大致可分为明遗民画和“四王、吴、恽”、“扬州八怪”等三方面。遗民画中，以朱耷的“墨荷水鸟图”最引人注意，这幅画不受成法的拘束，充分表现了荷花水鸟的特色。王时敏、王鉴、王翬、王原祁等技巧圆熟，善于摹仿古画，此后摹仿古人就成了清代一般画家中的风气。清代画中清新的是恽寿平（号南田）的几幅花卉，嶲逸的是华岩的八幅花鸟，两者都是有个性有特色的。在摹仿古人的风气之中，提倡创造，独抒个性，使人耳目一新的是“扬州八怪”及其门徒等。绘画馆陈列的金农的“梅花”，郑爕的“墨竹”，李鱓的“松藤图”，以及罗聘的“花鸟”等，充分表现了这一点。
    绘画馆所陈列的美术杰作，证明了艺术中真正优美的作品是可以永垂不朽的，也证明了中国艺术传统的伟大，文化遗产的优秀和丰富。绘画馆的开放，为研究中国古典美术从而推陈出新创造了条件。尤其重要的是原来深藏在深宫大院里的历代名画，如今由国家搜集保管，成为全民的宝贵财产，而且公开展览，使人人可以接近辉煌的艺术遗产，从而受到艺术教育与爱国主义教育。
    绘画馆筹备完成之后，曾举行预展。
    中央人民政府副主席朱德、李济深，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通，中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，政务院副总理郭沫若，政务院秘书长习仲勋，文化部部长沈雁冰，副部长周扬、丁西林，和首都著名的美术家、作家，以及中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会全体代表等约二千多人曾前往参观，一致赞扬。绘画馆的成立和开放，被认为是我国美术史上一件空前的大事。
