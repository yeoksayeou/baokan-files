Xinhua News Agency, November 15th Dispatch: According to TASS, November 14th Dispatch: The statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the press conference on the 13th regarding the issue of convening a foreign ministers' conference has evoked a wide reaction in French and British newspapers.

    The French newspaper *Le Figaro*, in a news headline about Molotov's statement, wrote: "Molotov...reiterates the need for discussions on international tensions with the participation of Communist China." Another Paris newspaper, *Combat*, pointed out: "Molotov's statement is not only a repetition of the content of the November 3rd note, but it is also clear that in his statement at the press conference...he issued a new warning on the issue of arming Germany..." *Le Parisien Libéré* wrote: "The Soviet Union proposes to discuss all disputes between East and West...Of course, everyone has long known that the well-intentioned people of our country and our allies support the principle of holding such negotiations; we fully agree with listing issues such as disarmament and the control of atomic weapons as causes of tension." The newspaper concluded that Molotov's statement has received a broad "reaction from French public opinion."

    In Britain, Molotov's statement caused some confusion and unease among bourgeois newspapers. These newspapers had to some extent distorted the Soviet note of November 3, giving many readers the impression that the Soviet government had rejected the suggestion of holding a conference to attempt to resolve the German question. The bourgeois newspapers adopted this attitude, of course, only to follow the lead of those in the United States and Britain who do not want to ease international tensions. Molotov's press conference dealt a severe blow to such a conspiracy to deceive millions of people in Britain and other countries who demand a peaceful solution to international problems. The diplomatic commentator of *The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post* said that after Molotov "refuted the argument that the Soviet Union was unwilling to negotiate with Western countries, he made it extremely clear that Russia will continue to advocate holding a five-power conference with the participation of Communist China to study ways to ease international tensions...Obviously, his argument is implying that Russia believes that without first reaching an agreement on disarmament and 'banning' atomic weapons, attempting to reach an agreement on the unification of Germany is an empty idea."

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th Dispatch: TASS New York, November 10th Dispatch: New York Radio news: The White House announced that U.S. President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Churchill, and French Premier Laniel are scheduled to hold talks in Bermuda from December 4th to 8th. The announcement also stated that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will accompany Eisenhower to the meeting, and British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Bidault will accompany the British Prime Minister and the French Premier, respectively.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 14th Dispatch: TASS Moscow, November 13th Dispatch: *Pravda*'s Paris correspondent reports: The extensive commentary in the French newspapers on the upcoming meeting of the heads of state of the United States, Britain, and France in Bermuda indicates that the U.S. State Department's plans for this conference have caused serious alarm in Paris.

    U.S. propaganda openly states that at the Bermuda conference, the United States will exert new pressure on France to get the French parliament to ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties.

    At the same time as the announcement of the Bermuda conference, West German Chancellor Adenauer, in an interview with a reporter from *U.S. News & World Report* magazine, said: France's endless delay in making a decision on these treaties is not permissible. Bonn clearly regards the Bermuda conference as "its own" conference and believes that West German revanchists will certainly be able to play the most powerful role in deciding France's fate.

    All of this explains why the tone of all the French newspapers is so sharp when commenting on the statement regarding the Bermuda conference. All French bourgeois newspapers pointed out that, from the French point of view, holding the Bermuda conference is at least inappropriate. The poor reaction of the French newspapers to the Bermuda conference shows that the new pressure exerted by the "cold war" instigators is being met with increasingly strong resistance from France.

　　莫洛托夫的声明引起法英舆论广泛的反应
    美国关于百慕大会议的计划使法国报纸大为震惊
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社十四日讯：苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在十三日记者招待会上发表的关于召开外长会议问题的声明，引起了法国和英国报纸的广泛反应。
    法国《费加罗报》在关于莫洛托夫声明的一则新闻标题中写道：“莫洛托夫……再次坚持必须举行有共产党中国参加的有关国际紧张局势问题的讨论”。另一家巴黎报纸《战斗报》指出：“莫洛托夫的声明，不仅是为了重复一遍十一月三日照会的内容，而且很明显，他在记者招待会上的声明中……就武装德国问题提出了新的警告……”《解放了的巴黎人报》写道：“苏联提议讨论一切东西方之间的纠纷……当然，大家早已知道，我国和我们盟国的善良的人们是支持举行这种谈判的原则的；把裁军和管制原子武器这一类问题列为造成紧张局势的原因，我们是完全同意的。”该报最后认为，莫洛托夫的声明，得到了广泛的“法国舆论界的反应”。
    在英国，莫洛托夫的声明引起了资产阶级报纸的某些困惑不安。这些报纸曾在某种程度上歪曲了苏联十一月三日的照会，给许多读者一种印象：似乎是苏联政府拒绝关于召开试图解决德国问题的会议的建议。资产阶级报纸采取这种态度，当然只是跟在美国和英国那些不愿缓和国际紧张局势的人物的后面跑。莫洛托夫举行的记者招待会，使这样一种企图迷惑英国和其他国家中千百万要求以和平方式解决国际问题的人的阴谋遭到了严重的失败。《每日电讯与晨邮报》外交评论员说，莫洛托夫“驳斥了似乎苏联不愿与西方各国谈判的论调之后，极其明显地表明，俄国今后仍将主张召开有共产党中国参加的五大国会议，以便研究缓和国际紧张局势的办法……显然，他的论据是在暗示：俄国认为，如果不首先在裁军和‘禁止’原子武器问题上达成协议，而要企图在统一德国问题上达成协议，这是空洞的想法。”
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社纽约十日讯：纽约电台消息：美国总统府白宫宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相邱吉尔和法国总理拉尼埃定于十二月四日至八日在百慕大举行会谈。通告还说，美国国务卿杜勒斯将陪同艾森豪威尔出席会议，英国外交大臣艾登和法国外交部长皮杜尔将分别陪同英国首相和法国总理出席会议。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：《真理报》驻巴黎记者报道：法国报纸对于美、英、法三国首脑即将在百慕大举行会议一事广泛发展的评论表明，美国外交当局关于这次会议的计划在巴黎引起了严重的震惊。
    美国的宣传公开表示：在百慕大会议上，美国将向法国行使新的压力，要法国议会批准波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    在宣布举行百慕大会议的同时，西德总理阿登纳在对《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志记者发表的谈话中说：法国在这些条约上无止境地拖延作出决定，是不能容许的。波恩显然把百慕大会议看作是“自己的”会议，并且认为西德报复主义者在决定法国命运方面一定能起最有力的作用。
    这一切说明，所有法国报纸在评论关于举行百慕大会议的声明时为什么语调这样尖锐。所有法国资产阶级报纸都指出，从法国的观点来看，召开百慕大会议至少是不适当的。法国报纸对于百慕大会议的反应不佳，说明“冷战”煽动者所行使的新压力遭到了法国日益强烈的反抗。
