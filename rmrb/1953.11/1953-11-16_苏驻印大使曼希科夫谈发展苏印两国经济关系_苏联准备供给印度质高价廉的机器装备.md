　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 14th: Soviet Ambassador to India, Mikhail Alekseevich Menshikov, said in an interview with reporters: Negotiations are currently underway in New Delhi regarding a trade and payment agreement between India and the Soviet Union. It seems that this agreement can be signed soon, and this agreement will inevitably become a more solid foundation for expanding economic relations between India and the Soviet Union.

　　Ambassador Menshikov said that until recently, the possibilities of developing economic relations between the Soviet Union and India had not been utilized to an appropriate extent, and that establishing more lasting and close economic relations between the two countries was not only possible but also necessary, and therefore would undoubtedly be beneficial to both sides.

　　He said that the Soviet Union is a highly developed industrial country, and in terms of trade, it not only supplies industrial parts, but also provides complete sets of machinery and equipment to factories and enterprises in many countries, and provides all kinds of technical and scientific assistance in various ways.

　　When a reporter asked Ambassador Menshikov what this assistance referred to, Ambassador Menshikov said: For example, in terms of technical assistance, the Soviet Union sends experts to other countries to assist them in installing, adjusting, and using industrial and agricultural equipment. At the same time, he also mentioned that in order to help other countries develop industry and agriculture, they also help them with design and planning, and provide advice, or send Soviet experts.

　　Ambassador Menshikov said: The Soviet Union can supply the equipment and machinery necessary for India's economic development, such as mining, construction, transportation, road construction, textile and printing machinery, large-scale power generation machinery and equipment, agricultural machinery and tractors, machine tools, excavators, compressor equipment, various tools, ball bearings, etc., as well as grain (wheat and barley) and other food products.

　　He also said that the Soviet Union is prepared to sell its goods to India at prices no higher than those of other competitors.

　　At the same time, the quality of these goods is excellent, and in any case, no less than the same goods supplied by other countries.

　　Ambassador Menshikov explained that Soviet foreign trade organizations can purchase goods that India regularly exports, such as spices, hides, shellac, vegetable fiber products, etc., as well as jute products and certain grades of tea and tobacco that India encounters some difficulties in selling in foreign markets.

　　He also pointed out: If necessary, the goods exported by the Soviet Union to India and the goods exported by India to the Soviet Union can be shipped by Soviet transportation agencies. Of course, Indian cargo ships can also be used to ship goods.

　　Regarding the issue of developing cultural relations between India and the Soviet Union, Menshikov emphasized that in view of the strong desire of the Indian people and the Soviet people to learn more about each other's culture and achievements, the current exchange of delegations is certainly not enough. The Soviet people will be very happy to welcome more Indian guests—scientists, writers, actors, social workers, representatives of industry, trade, and agriculture—to the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they are also willing to send Soviet representatives to India.

　　苏驻印大使曼希科夫谈发展苏印两国经济关系
    苏联准备供给印度质高价廉的机器装备
    【新华社新德里十四日电】苏联驻印度大使来哈伊尔·阿列克谢维奇·曼希科夫在接见记者时说：目前新德里正在进行关于印度和苏联的贸易和付款协定的谈判，看来这个协定不久就可以签订，这个协定必然会成为扩大印度与苏联经济关系的更为巩固的基础。
    曼希科夫大使说，直到最近为止，还没有把发展苏联和印度之间经济关系的可能性利用到适当的程度，而两国之间建立更为持久和密切的经济关系不仅是可能的，并且是需要的，因此这毫无疑问对双方都会是有利的。
    他说，苏联是一个工业高度发展的国家，它在贸易方面不仅供应工业零件，而且供给很多国家的工厂和企业以整套的机器设备，并且以各种方式提供各式各样的技术和科学援助。
    当记者问曼希科夫大使这种援助指的是什么时，曼希科夫大使说：例如，在技术援助方面，苏联派遣专家到其他国家去协助它们装置、调节与运用工业和农业设备。同时，他还谈到，为了帮助其他国家发展工农业，还帮助它们设计和筹划，并提供意见，或是派遣苏联专家前往。
    曼希科夫大使说：苏联可以供给印度经济发展所必需的设备和机器，诸如矿业、建筑、运输、筑路、纺织和印花机器、巨型发电机器和设备、农业机器和拖拉机、工作母机、掘凿机、压缩器装备、各种工具、球轴承等、以及粮食（小麦和大麦）和其他的食品。
    他又说，苏联准备把它的货物以不高于其他竞争者的价格出售给印度。
    同时，这些货物的质量都是上等的，无论如何不次于其他国家供应的同样货物。
    曼希科夫大使解释说，苏联对外贸易机构可以向印度购买它经常输出的货物，如香料、兽皮、虫胶片、植物纤维品等以及印度在国外市场销售遇到某些困难的黄麻产品与某些等级的茶叶与烟草。
    他还指出：如果需要的话，苏联向印度输出的货物与印度向苏联输出的货物可以由苏联运输机构装运。当然，也可以用印度货船来装运货物。
    谈到发展印度与苏联的文化关系问题，曼希科夫强调说，鉴于印度人民与苏联人民都有强烈的愿望，希望更多地了解彼此的文化与成就，所以目前这样的交换代表团当然是不够的。苏联人民将非常高兴地欢迎更多的印度客人——科学家、作家、演员、社会工作者、工业、贸易与农业的代表——到苏联去，同时，他们也愿意派苏联的代表到印度来。
