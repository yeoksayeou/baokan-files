    Introduction to the Chinese Edition, No. 45, of "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!"
    The Chinese edition of the Cominform's newspaper "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!", 1953, No. 45, has been published.
    This issue is a special edition celebrating the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Festival of the Working People of All Countries," and also carries many important celebratory articles, which are: "The Banner of the October Socialist Revolution is Forever Invincible" by Wu Yuzhang, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; "The Soviet Union is a Powerful Fortress of Peace in Europe and the World" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party; "The Alliance of the Working Class and the Laboring Peasants is the Guarantee of Romania's Victorious Construction of Socialism" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "A Great Source of Inspiration for the People of All Countries in Their Struggle for Freedom, Independence, and a Happy Future" by Antonín Zápotocký, President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Secretary of the Political Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party; "The Soviet Union is a Great Friend of the Polish People" by Władysław Jóźwiak-Witold, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "The Guiding Star of the Working People of the World" by Georgi Damyanov, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; "The Soviet Union is an Indestructible Fortress of Peace and the Security of All Peoples" by Kim Il, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; "Truth Will Prevail" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.
    The editorial in this issue points out: November 7th is not only the greatest festival of the working people of the Soviet Union, but also the great festival of the working people of the whole world. The Russian Socialist Revolution is a turning point in the fate of mankind, the development of contemporary society, and the entire history of the world. It dealt a fatal blow to international capitalism and opened a new era in human history—the era of the liberation of the working people from the shackles of capitalism. The entire historical process since the October Revolution has proved the increasing decline of capitalism and that the economy of the capitalist world has fallen into the abyss of the deepening general crisis of capitalism and the constant recurrence of economic crises. The victory of the October Revolution awakened the broad masses of the people in the colonies and dependencies. Now, the entire colonial world has stood up, and no force in the world can hinder the process of the growth of the national liberation forces of the people of the colonies and dependencies. In the struggle for peace, for international security, and against the conspiracies of international reactionaries, the Soviet Union is the leading and decisive force. The victorious construction of socialism in the Soviet Union and the victorious advance of the Soviet people along the road to communism have inspired new revolutionary forces, promoted the struggle of the international proletariat, and strengthened the unity of the working people of all countries. Under the influence of the great October Revolution and inspired by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, communist parties have emerged in almost all countries, and these parties today have 25 million members, a mighty army composed of communists who are heroic fighters against imperialist oppression and for the freedom and happy lives of their people.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十五期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第四十五期已经出版。
    本期是庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年专号。本期发表了题为“各国劳动人民的伟大节日”的社论，并刊载了许多重要的庆祝文章，它们是：中国共产党中央委员吴玉章的“十月社会主义革命的旗帜是永远不可战胜的”，法国共产党书记雅·杜克洛的“苏联是欧洲和世界和平的强大堡垒”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记格·乔治乌—德治的“工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟是罗马尼亚胜利建设社会主义的保证”，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治书记处书记安·萨波托斯基的“各国人民争取自由、独立和幸福前途的伟大鼓舞泉源”，波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员弗·约兹维亚克—维托尔德的“苏联是波兰人民的伟大朋友”，保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员格·达米扬诺夫的“世界劳动人民的引路星”，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金一的“苏联是和平与各国人民安全的不可摧毁的堡垒”，英国共产党总书记哈·波立特的“真理一定胜利”。
    本期的社论指出：十一月七日不仅是苏联劳动人民的最伟大的节日，而且也是全世界劳动人民的伟大节日。俄国社会主义革命是人类命运、当代社会的发展和整个世界历史的转折点。它给了国际资本主义一个致命的打击，在人类历史上开辟了新的纪元——劳动人民从资本主义枷锁下获得解放的纪元。十月革命以来的整个历史过程证明了资本主义日趋没落，证明了资本主义世界的经济已陷入资本主义总危机不断加深和经济危机不断重演的深渊中。十月革命的胜利唤醒了殖民地和附属国的广大人民。现在，整个殖民地世界已经站起来了，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挠殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放力量增长的进程。在争取和平、争取国际安全、反对国际反动派的阴谋斗争中，苏联是领导的力量和决定性的力量。苏联社会主义的胜利建成和苏联人民沿着共产主义道路的胜利前进，激发了新的革命力量，促进了国际无产阶级的斗争，加强了各国劳动人民的团结。在伟大的十月革命的影响下，在苏联共产党的鼓舞下，差不多所有国家中都产生了共产主义者的政党，这些政党今天已拥有两千五百万党员，这是一支声势浩大的军队，组成这支军队的共产主义者都是反对帝国主义压迫、争取本国人民的自由和幸福生活的英勇战士。
