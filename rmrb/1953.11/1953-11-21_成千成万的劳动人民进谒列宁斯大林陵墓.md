Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th: Since the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum was opened on the 17th, tens of thousands of working people have been continuously going to pay their respects to the remains of their beloved leaders and teachers.

    In the past few days, Red Square, covered with a layer of pure white snow, has appeared particularly solemn and respectful. People formed long lines, braving the early winter chill and snowflakes, slowly moving forward from below the Kremlin wall on the left side of Red Square. As the chimes from the Spassky Tower sounded, those paying their respects to the remains reached the front of the mausoleum. They removed their hats and bowed their heads, reverently ascending the steps of the mausoleum with infinite longing and respect.

    Engraved on the marble at the entrance of the mausoleum are two great names: "Lenin, Stalin." The fir trees on both sides are already covered with freshly fallen snowflakes. Wreaths presented by those paying their respects are placed on both sides of the mausoleum. Among them is a wreath presented by the Chinese Trade Union delegation.

    After passing through two corridors, people see the immortal bodies of Lenin and Stalin. They are now lying side by side. Lenin's crystal coffin is placed on the right facing the entrance, and Stalin's crystal coffin is on the left. Stalin is wearing the uniform of a Generalissimo, his hands resting peacefully on his chest. In the dim red light, people walking by silently at a slow pace gazed attentively at the faces of these two close comrades-in-arms, as wise and perspicacious as they were in life.

    People walked past Lenin's crystal coffin, then past Stalin's crystal coffin, and then towards the exit on the left. They frequently looked back, even though the people behind them had already blocked their view.

    Before and after entering and leaving the mausoleum, people affectionately looked at the reviewing stand above the mausoleum and Red Square in front of the mausoleum. People could not help but recall a still fresh scene: More than ten days ago, the masses celebrating the October Revolution Day parade held the banners of Lenin and Stalin here, receiving the review of the successors of Lenin and Stalin's cause—the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government—and shouting slogans of advancing victoriously towards communism. People could not help but feel such a profound impression: In the short few months since Stalin's death, under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party and government, the Soviet people have done so many things to advance towards communism!

    Paying homage to the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum made people feel that they should strive to learn from Lenin and Stalin's spirit of dedicating everything to the cause of communism. It also made everyone feel that Lenin and Stalin's ideas will forever illuminate people, and that Lenin and Stalin's cause is advancing victoriously.

    成千成万的劳动人民进谒列宁斯大林陵墓
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】列宁斯大林陵墓从十七日开放以后，成千成万的劳动人民络绎不绝地前去瞻仰敬爱的领袖和导师的遗容。
    这几天来，蒙上一层洁白的薄雪的红场，显得分外庄严肃穆。人们排成长长的行列，冒着初冬的寒风和雪花，慢慢地从红场左边克里姆林宫墙下面向前移动着。斯巴斯基塔上的钟声响了，瞻仰遗容的人们走到陵墓的正面。他们脱帽俯首，怀着无限的思念和敬意鱼贯地走上陵墓的阶梯。
    陵墓入口处的大理石上刻着两个伟大的名字：“列宁、斯大林”。两侧的枞树上已积着刚刚落下的雪片。陵墓两旁摆着瞻仰遗容的人们呈献的花圈。其中也有中国工会代表团敬献的花圈。
    转过两个过道，人们就看到了不朽的列宁和斯大林的遗体。他们现在紧靠着躺在一起。列宁的水晶棺放在面对入口的右面，斯大林的水晶棺放在左边。斯大林穿着大元帅的军服，两手平静地放在胸前。在淡红色的灯光下，以缓慢的脚步静默地走过的人们，凝神地瞻仰着这两位亲密战友的如像生前一样英明和睿智的面容。
    人们从列宁的水晶棺旁边走过，又从斯大林的水晶棺旁边走过，然后走向左边的出口。他们频频地回头瞻望，虽然后边的人已经遮断了他们的视线。
    在进出陵墓的前后，人们亲切地瞻仰着陵墓上面的检阅台和陵墓前面的红场，人们心中不能不浮现出一幕还很新鲜的情景：十多天前，庆祝十月革命节游行的群众在这里举着列宁、斯大林的旗帜，接受列宁和斯大林事业的继承者——苏联共产党和政府的领袖们的检阅，高呼着胜利地向共产主义前进的口号。人们心中也不能不涌起这样深刻的印象：在斯大林逝世以来这短短的几个月中，苏联人民在自己亲爱的共产党和政府的领导下，曾经做了多么多的向共产主义前进的事情啊！
    进谒列宁斯大林陵墓，使人们感到应该努力地学习列宁、斯大林把一切献给共产主义事业的精神，也使大家感到列宁斯大林的思想永远照耀着人们，列宁斯大林的事业在胜利地前进着。
