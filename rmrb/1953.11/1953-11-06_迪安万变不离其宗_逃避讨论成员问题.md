Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 5th. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: At the Sino-American talks on the political conference issue on the 4th, American representative Arthur Dean continued to refuse to determine an agenda and refused to first discuss the issue of membership in the political conference. He adopted the attitude of a habitually cunning businessman, comparing the serious discussion of the conference agenda to a haggling transaction. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles praised his law firm partner on the 3rd, saying that he "showed great skill, wit, and patience" in the talks. This is no accident. In the past nine meetings, Dean has indeed faithfully implemented Dulles' policy of obstructing the convening of the political conference, trying every trick to refuse to determine the agenda and refusing to discuss the issue of membership in the political conference.

Even before the talks began, Dean repeatedly claimed that he was "not authorized" to discuss the issue of membership in the political conference. At the first meeting of the talks on October 26, Dean did not want an agenda at all; the prepared statement he had did not include an agenda item. He attempted to hold a meeting without an agenda, so that he could only talk about the time and place of the political conference while ignoring the issue of membership. It was only because the Korean-Chinese side proposed five agenda items that he had to hastily put together a four-item agenda proposal. The issue of membership in the political conference was not included in these four items at all.

Because the Korean-Chinese side insisted on determining an agenda and first discussing the issue of membership, which is related to the future of the political conference, Dean acted like an eel, using every trick to avoid discussing this issue. At first, he tried to bluff, putting on the airs of a victor, using the threat of resuming the war to force the Korean-Chinese side to abandon its position. But he quickly had to put down this stinking pose and resort to lying and deception. He tried to distort Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the records of the Korean Armistice negotiations, and the notices from the Chinese and Korean governments to the U.S. government, insisting that the Korean-Chinese side originally did not advocate neutral countries participating in the political conference and agreed not to discuss the issue of membership in the political conference during the bilateral talks. After these lies were refuted, Dean proposed so-called "new proposals" one after another. His first "new proposal" was to advocate choosing one of the three issues—time, place, and procedure—to discuss first. His second "new proposal" was to advocate discussing the so-called "easy to solve" issues of time and place first. His third "new proposal" was to advocate that the two sides conduct discussions according to a so-called flexible and unordered agenda. His fourth "new proposal" was to advocate that the two sides first reach an agreement on the time and place of the political conference, and then "exchange opinions" on the issue of membership in the political conference. His fifth "new proposal" was to advocate discussing each item on both sides' agendas in turn, but to discuss the time and place issues first, while the membership issue would still only be "exchanged opinions." His sixth "new proposal" advocated discussing all issues simultaneously, but the membership issue was still limited to "exchanging opinions."

Dean was performing magic tricks at the negotiating table, pretending that it was possible to exchange opinions on the membership issue, but outside the meeting he kept saying that he was not authorized to discuss the membership issue, and that this issue was a matter for the political conference.

It is very clear that no matter how many so-called "new proposals" Dean puts forward, they are not "new" at all. Invariably, the sole purpose of these proposals is to exclude discussion of the issue of membership in the political conference. Because not determining an agenda makes it easier for him to achieve this goal, the two sides have still not been able to agree on an agenda. Dean's stubborn opposition to discussing the issue of membership in the political conference and opposition to neutral countries participating in the political conference proves more powerfully than any eloquence that the U.S. government lacks sincerity regarding the political conference.

Everyone knows that, except for a small handful of warmongers in the United States, no one disagrees that the Korean political conference must have neutral countries participating. Because the Korean issue is an issue related to peace in Asia and the world, such an issue should not only be resolved by the belligerent parties alone, without allowing relevant neutral countries, especially Asian neutral countries, to participate. This is not only inappropriate, but also clearly deprives relevant neutral Asian countries of the opportunity and qualification to be concerned about Asian affairs. This is a truth. Since the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference is so important, the bilateral talks arranging the conference must include it in the agenda. It is precisely for this reason that the Korean-Chinese side insists that the agenda of the bilateral talks must definitely include discussing and resolving the issue of conference membership, and that this issue must be discussed and resolved first.

It is not difficult to understand that the agenda of the bilateral talks should be arranged according to the importance of each item. The issue of membership in the political conference is related to whether the conference can proceed smoothly, and it is necessary and natural to put it at the top of the agenda. It is impossible to imagine discussing other arrangements for the conference when the issue of who will attend the conference has not been resolved. If the agenda of the bilateral talks is not arranged according to the importance of the issues, is it feasible to discuss how to raise funds for the conference, how to organize the secretariat, how to arrange the equipment, etc., when it is not known who will participate in the conference, when it is not known when and where the conference will be held? Of course, it is not feasible. All of this cannot be decided until the issue of which countries will participate in the conference is resolved. Before the issue of conference membership is discussed and resolved, discussing other issues is tantamount to idle talk and a deliberate delay.

Moreover, it should be particularly pointed out that the U.S. representative is constantly changing his tricks, but he stubbornly insists on discussing the time and place issues first. His conspiracy is that after discussing the time and place issues, he can arbitrarily refuse to discuss and resolve the membership issue, and even take out their tricks of sabotage during the armistice negotiations, unilaterally adjourning the meeting, so that this issue cannot be resolved, thereby making it impossible to convene the political conference. At that time, the U.S. side can, according to their wishful thinking, shift the responsibility for obstructing the convening of the political conference to the Korean-Chinese side. This is the most vicious and despicable purpose that remains unchanged in all the "new proposals" of the U.S. representative.

The U.S. side's refusal to determine an agenda and refusal to first discuss and resolve the issue of conference membership is inseparable from its consistent hegemonic proposition of refusing neutral countries to participate in the political conference. The U.S. side is afraid that with the participation of neutral countries, its domineering and dictatorial practice of manipulating everything will be more exposed to the world, they will be more isolated, and their conspiracy to obstruct consultations and create international tensions will encounter more difficulties.

In the final analysis, the U.S. representative's refusal to first discuss and resolve the issue of conference membership is entirely a means for the U.S. side to delay and obstruct the convening of the political conference. He knows that the Korean-Chinese side will definitely insist that neutral countries should participate in the political conference, and will definitely insist that the bilateral talks should first discuss and resolve the issue of conference membership, and he also knows that doing so is reasonable, but he stubbornly opposes this reasonable proposition, isn't the purpose to make the bilateral talks fruitless and make the political conference impossible to convene? People remember that even before the bilateral talks, the U.S. side had already predicted that the convening of the political conference would be a distant prospect.

### 迪安万变不离其宗—逃避讨论成员问题

     迪安万变不离其宗—逃避讨论成员问题
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美国代表阿瑟·迪安在四日的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中，仍然拒绝确定一个议程，拒绝首先讨论关于政治会议的成员问题。他摆出一副惯耍滑头的买卖人的派头，把严肃的关于会谈议程的讨论，比喻作一桩讨价还价的买卖。美国国务卿杜勒斯在三日称赞他这位律师事务所中的伙伴，说他在会谈中“表现了很大的技巧、机智和耐性”。这不是偶然的。在过去的九次会谈中，迪安的确忠实地执行了杜勒斯的阻挠政治会议的召开的政策，想尽一切花样来拒绝确定议程，并拒不讨论政治会议的成员问题。
    在还没有举行会谈以前，迪安就一再宣称他“无权”讨论政治会议的成员问题。在十月二十六日双方会谈第一次会议上，迪安根本不想要有什么会谈议程，他预先准备好的发言稿里是没有议程这一项的。他企图进行一个没有议程的会谈，以便光谈政治会议的时间和地点问题而撇开政治会议的成员问题不谈。只是由于朝中方面提出了五项议程，他才不得不临时拼凑出一个四项议程的方案来。这四项议程中根本就没有政治会议的成员问题。
    由于朝中方面坚持确定议程并首先讨论关系政治会议前途的成员问题，迪安就像一条泥鳅似的大耍滑头，竭力逃避讨论这个问题。他最初还想打肿了脸充胖子，摆出一副胜利者的架子，用恢复战争的恫吓来压迫朝中方面放弃自己的主张。可是他很快就不得不放下这副臭架子，改用说谎欺骗的办法。他竭力歪曲朝鲜停战协定第六十款、朝鲜停战谈判的记录，以及朝中两国政府给美国政府的通知，硬说朝中方面本来就不主张中立国参加政治会议，并且同意不在双方会谈中讨论政治会议成员问题。在这些谎话被驳斥以后，迪安就一个接一个地提出所谓“新方案”。他的第一个“新方案”是主张在时间、地点、程序三个问题中选择一个先进行讨论。他的第二个“新方案”是主张先讨论所谓“容易解决”的时间和地点问题。他的第三个“新方案”是主张双方按照一个所谓灵活而不定次序的议程进行讨论。他的第四个“新方案”是主张双方先就政治会议的时间与地点达成协议，然后就政治会议成员问题“交换意见”。他的第五个“新方案”是主张轮流讨论双方议程的每一个项目，但是要先讨论时间和地点问题，至于成员问题则仍然只是“交换意见”。他的第六个“新方案”，主张同时讨论一切问题，但是成员问题仍然只限于“交换意见”。
    迪安一面在会谈桌上耍魔术，装成好像可以对成员问题交换意见，但是在会外他却一个劲地说他无权讨论成员问题，这个问题是政治会议的事。
      可以看得很清楚，无论迪安提出多少个所谓“新方案”，可是它们一点没有什么“新”的地方。万变不离其宗，这些方案的唯一目的，就是要排除讨论政治会议的成员问题。因为不确定议程就更便于他达到这个目的，因此直到现在，双方会谈连议程还定不出来。迪安顽固地反对讨论政治会议的成员问题，反对中立国参加政治会议，这就比任何雄辩更加有力地证明美国政府对于政治会议缺乏诚意。
    世人皆知，除了美国的一小撮好战分子以外，现在已经没有人不同意朝鲜政治会议必须有中立国家参加。因为朝鲜问题是有关亚洲以及世界和平的问题，这样的问题只由交战双方来解决，而不许有关的中立国，特别是亚洲中立国家参加，这不但不应该，而且显然是剥夺亚洲有关中立国家过问亚洲事务的机会和资格。这是一个真理。中立国参加政治会议的问题既如此重要，那么，安排会议的双方会谈就必须将它列入议程。正是因为这个原故，朝中方面坚持双方会谈的议程必须肯定包括讨论和解决会议成员问题，而且必须首先讨论和解决这个问题。
    人们不难了解，双方会谈的议程，应该根据每项议程的重要性来排列。政治会议的成员问题关系到会议能否顺利进行，放在议程的首位是十分必要也是十分自然的。不可能设想，当会议由谁参加的问题还没有解决就讨论会议的其他安排。双方会谈的议程，如果不按问题的重要性来排列，那么，在会议还不知有些什么人来参加的时候，在会议还不知在什么时间什么地点举行的时候，就来谈会议的经费如何筹措，会议的秘书处如何组织，会议的设备如何布置等等，行不行呢？当然是不行的。这一切在究竟有那些国家参加会议这个问题未解决前是不能作决定的。在会议成员问题没有讨论和解决之前，讨论其他问题无异是无聊的空谈，无异是有计划的拖延。
    而且应该特别指出的是，美方代表花样翻新，但始终固执地要首先讨论时间和地点问题，其阴谋是在讨论了时间和地点问题之后，他就可以任意拒绝讨论和解决成员问题，甚至拿出他们在停战谈判时的破坏伎俩，片面休会，使这一问题得不到解决，从而使政治会议不能召开。到那时，美方就可以按照他们的如意算盘，把阻挠政治会议召开的责任推到朝中方面。这就是美方代表所有“新方案”中始终不变的最恶毒而卑鄙的目的。
    美方拒绝确定议程，拒绝首先讨论和解决会议成员问题，是和它拒绝中立国参加政治会议的一贯的横蛮主张分不开的。美方害怕在有中立国参加之下，他那种独断专横、操纵一切的作法就要更加暴露在世人面前，他们就要更加孤立，他们阻挠协商、制造国际紧张局势的阴谋活动就要遭遇更多的困难。
    归根到底，美方代表拒绝首先讨论和解决会议成员问题，完全是美方拖延和阻挠政治会议的召开的一个手段。他明知朝中方面一定坚持中立国应参加政治会议，一定坚持双方会谈应该首先讨论和解决会议成员问题，而且他明知这样做是合理的，但他偏偏固执地反对这个合理主张，其目的不就是使双方会谈毫无结果，使政治会议开不成吗？人们还记得，还在双方会谈之前，美方即已预言政治会议的召开将遥遥无期了。
