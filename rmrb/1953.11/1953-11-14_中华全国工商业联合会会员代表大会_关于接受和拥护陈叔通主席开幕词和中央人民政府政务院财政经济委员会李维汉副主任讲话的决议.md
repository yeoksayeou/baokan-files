After serious discussion, everyone recognized the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, clarified the role, path, and future of private industry and commerce during this period, and felt satisfied and excited. It is hereby solemnly declared that we accept and endorse all the instructions in Chairman Chen Shutong's opening address and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's speech, are willing to strive for their implementation, and resolve as follows:

	I. The conference unanimously supports the state's general line and general task during the transition period and the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce. Private industrialists and businessmen nationwide must actively engage in businesses that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, accept the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, and actively adapt to the state's socialist transformation requirements.

	II. The conference unanimously believes that gradually completing the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through state capitalism is a relatively sound policy and method, which is beneficial to the state and the people, as well as to private industrialists and businessmen. Private industrialists and businessmen nationwide should actively and consciously develop in the direction of state capitalism according to the needs and possibilities of the state.

	III. Socialist transformation is a long-term task. In order to do this work well, we must combine the transformation of individuals with the transformation of enterprises. We must first strengthen the transformation of our personal thoughts and work styles, strengthen education on patriotism and law-abidingness, and education on the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce, continuously and repeatedly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conduct serious criticism and struggle against all illegal activities.

	IV. In order to realize the glorious task of the first five-year construction plan, private industrialists and businessmen must actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, improve business management, improve production technology, reduce product costs, improve product quality, and increase the production of inexpensive and high-quality goods, within the state's planning track and based on the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, to serve the needs of national construction and the vast people. In order to realize this task, private industrialists and businessmen must take the initiative to strive for the leadership of the state-owned economy, take the initiative to accept the supervision of the working masses, absorb worker representatives to participate in enterprise management, and achieve the democratization of enterprise management.

	V. Continue to improve the organizations of industry and commerce federations at all levels, steadily reorganize trade associations, eliminate their feudal guild nature, and give play to their professional and active role; strengthen unity and mutual assistance among large, medium, and small enterprises, so that each can be in its proper place, and continue to cultivate progressive backbones. At the same time, industry and commerce federations at all levels should focus on improving production and management, strengthen education for private industrialists and businessmen, and correctly represent their legitimate interests.

The conference unanimously recognizes that under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the state's general line and general task during the transition period will be steadily implemented. As long as private industrialists and businessmen follow this path, they will not only have reasonable profits to gain, but also a bright future. The conference requires industry and commerce federations at all levels to organize widespread and in-depth study of Chairman Chen Shutong's opening speech and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's speech, unite the vast number of industrialists and businessmen across the country, and jointly strive to implement the general line and general task of the transition period.

    关于接受和拥护陈叔通主席开幕词和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会李维汉副主任讲话的决议
    会议听取了陈叔通主席的开幕词和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会李维汉副主任的讲话，经过认真地讨论，大家都认识了国家过渡时期总路线和总任务，明确了私营工商业在这个时期中的作用、道路和前途，一致感到满意和兴奋。兹特郑重宣告接受和拥护陈叔通主席的开幕词和李维汉副主任讲话中的各项指示，愿为其贯彻而奋斗，并决议如下：
    一、大会一致拥护国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务和对私营工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策。全国私营工商业者必须积极经营有利于国计民生的事业，接受人民政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，并积极适应国家的社会主义改造的要求。
    二、大会一致认为经过国家资本主义逐步完成对私营工商业的社会主义改造，是较健全的方针和办法，对国家和人民、对私营工商业者都有利益。全国私营工商业者应根据国家的需要和可能，积极地和自觉地向国家资本主义方向发展。
    三、社会主义改造是一项长期的工作，为了做好这项工作，我们必须把个人的改造与企业的改造结合起来。我们首先必须加强个人的思想和作风的改造，加强爱国守法的教育和国家对于私营工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策的教育，不断地和反复地展开批评与自我批评，对一切违法行为进行严肃的批判和斗争。
    四、为了实现第一个五年建设计划的光荣任务，私营工商业者必须在国家的计划轨道上，依据供、产、销平衡原则，积极进行增产节约，改善经营管理，提高生产技术，减低产品成本，提高产品质量，增产价廉物美的商品，为国家建设和供应广大人民的需要服务。为要实现这个任务，私营工商业者必须主动地争取国营经济的领导，主动地接受工人群众的监督，吸收工人代表参加企业管理，做到企业管理的民主化。
    五、继续健全各级工商业联合会的组织，稳步改组同业公会，肃清其封建的行会性，发挥其专业性的积极作用；使大、中、小企业加强团结互助，各得其所，并继续培养进步骨干。同时，各级工商业联合会应以改善生产经营为中心，加强对私营工商业者的教育工作，并正确地代表其合法利益。
    大会一致认识在伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，一定会稳步贯彻的。私营工商业者只要遵循这条道路，就不仅有合理的利润可得，而且有光明的前途。大会要求各级工商业联合会，对陈叔通主席的开幕辞和李维汉副主任的讲话，组织普遍和深入的学习，团结全国广大工商业者，共同为贯彻过渡时期总路线总任务而奋斗。（新华社）
