Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 28th, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, General Li Xiangchao, refuted the U.S. side's attempt to evade responsibility for seriously violating the armistice agreement by transporting reinforcement war materials from outside Korea.

　　Based on the comprehensive report and commentary of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, General Li Xiangchao had strongly protested at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 18th against the U.S. side's use of the "Tachira Seaman" to transport 106 mortars into Busan on July 31, the fourth day after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement; and protested against the U.S. side's falsification of the numbers of war materials and military personnel entering and leaving Korea in reports to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, pointing out that the U.S. side was attempting to use deceptive methods to violate the armistice agreement by transporting reinforcement military forces from outside Korea.

　　The chief member of the U.S. side, Lacy, dared not deny these factual and irrefutable evidences on the 18th. But today he claimed that the U.S. side's falsification of the numbers of war materials and military personnel entering and leaving Korea did not violate the armistice agreement, and fabricated the lie that the "Tachira Seaman" arrived in Incheon on July 25 before sailing to Busan, attempting to evade the responsibility for the U.S. side's serious violation of the armistice agreement by transporting war materials.

　　In refuting Lacy's lies, General Li Xiangchao pointed out: Your side's violation of the armistice agreement by transporting 106 mortars, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection team stationed in Busan conducted a lengthy and careful investigation. The fact that your side violated the agreement in terms of replacement and rotation is undeniable. General Li Xiangchao questioned Lacy: Why couldn't your side provide explanatory materials during the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's investigation? Why can't you give specific answers to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's report now? Lacy was once again speechless on these questions today and could not answer.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th: The Fourth Joint Observer Team's on-site investigation on the 19th confirmed that the U.S. side violated the armistice agreement by shelling the Guihu Cave area southeast of Suoning in our side's demilitarized zone north of the military demarcation line. The chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, General Li Xiangchao, has protested to the U.S. side regarding the U.S. side's shelling of our demilitarized zone.

　　The incident of the U.S. side shelling our demilitarized zone near Guihu Cave occurred at 19:10 on November 16. According to the instructions of the Military Armistice Commission, members of both sides of the Fourth Joint Observer Team met in Guihu Cave at 4:00 p.m. on the 19th and immediately went to the site shelled by the U.S. side for on-site investigation.

　　Members of both sides unanimously agreed: A shell exploded in a narrow strip of land about five meters wide at the foot of a cliff on the east bank of the Imjin River. This shell was a U.S.-made M-2 type 4.2-inch caliber white phosphorus mortar shell. Many newly exploded shell fragments were found at the site, the largest piece being 37 cm long and 13 cm wide, with the English words "(1952) 4.2 (INCH MZ AILT)" on it. Several pieces of burned grass were found at the above location, and there were many yellow chemical stains on the stones, but no crater was found. Witnesses Xing Guochao and Wu Jingyan testified that before the shell exploded, there was a "hissing" sound from the southeast, and a strong flash of light was seen in the sky above the ground during the explosion.

　　Although the U.S. side members had to admit the above facts, they attempted to say that the shell exploded on its own in order to evade the responsibility of the U.S. side shelling our demilitarized zone.

　　The Korean-Chinese side members pointed out: The water level of the Imjin River has not changed for a long time, the witnesses testified that the flash of the explosion was in the air, and there was no crater at the site, so it can be concluded that the shell exploded in the air. Newly exploded shell fragments were found at the site. The witnesses heard a "hissing" sound from the southeast before the explosion. Therefore, the U.S. side's attempt to evade responsibility is untenable. Based on the on-site investigation results and witness testimony, the Korean-Chinese side members confirmed that the shell that bombarded our demilitarized zone in Guihu Cave was fired from the U.S. side's station and submitted the judgment to the Military Armistice Commission on the 27th.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会二十八日举行会议
    我方斥责美方违反协定运入作战物资
    李相朝将军抗议美方炮击我方非军事区
    【新华社开城二十八日电】军事停战委员会二十八日会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军驳斥美方企图逃避严重违反停战协定从朝鲜境外运入增援性作战物资的责任。
    李相朝将军根据中立国监察委员会的综合报告与评论，曾在军事停战委员会十八日会议上，强硬抗议美方在停战协定签字并生效后第四天——七月三十一日，用“塔希尔海员”号轮船把一百零六门迫击炮运入釜山；并抗议美方伪造向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告的进出朝鲜的作战物资及军事人员的数字，指出美方企图以欺骗蒙混的办法，违反停战协定从朝鲜境外运进增援性的军事力量。
    美方首席委员拉西在十八日不敢否认这些证据确凿无可辩驳的事实。但他今天却声称美方伪造进出朝鲜的作战物资和军事人员的数字并不违反停战协定，并捏造出“塔希尔海员”号轮船是在七月二十五日到达仁川后再开往釜山的谎言，企图推卸美方严重违反停战协定运进作战物资的责任。
    李相朝将军在驳斥拉西的谎言时指出：你方违反停战协定运进一百零六门迫击炮，中立国监察委员会及其驻釜山的中立国视察小组曾经进行了长时间的仔细调查。你方在替换与轮换方面违反协议的事实，是不容抵赖的。李相朝将军质问拉西：你方为什么在中立国监察委员会调查期间不能提出说明的材料？现在为什么不能对中立国监察委员会的报告作具体的答复？拉西今天对这些问题再次哑口无言，无法作答。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】第四联合观察小组在十九日进行的现场调查，证实美方违反停战协定，炮击军事分界线以北我方非军事区内朔宁东南的桂湖洞附近地区。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军已就美方炮击我方非军事区的事件，向美方提出抗议。
    美方炮击桂湖洞附近我方非军事区的事件，是在十一月十六日十九时十分发生的。第四联合观察小组双方组员根据军事停战委员会的指令，于十九日下午四时在桂湖洞会晤后，即前往被美方炮击的地点进行现场调查。
    双方组员一致同意：在临津江东岸峭壁下宽约五公尺的狭长地带，发生了炮弹爆炸，这颗炮弹是美方使用的M—二型四点二英寸口径的白磷迫击炮弹。在该地发现了许多新爆炸的炮弹弹片，最大的一块长三十七公分，宽十三公分，上面有（一九五二）四·二（INCH MZ AILT）英文字样。在上述地点发现有若干块被焚烧过的草，在石头上有许多黄色化学物斑点，但并未发现弹坑。证人刑国超和吴敬颜证明：在炮弹爆发前有来自东南方的“嘶”的声音，在爆炸声中看见该地上空的强烈火光。
    美方组员虽然不得不承认上述事实，但又企图把该炮弹说成是自行爆炸，以便逃避美方炮击我方非军事区的责任。
    朝中方面组员指出：临津江的水位许久以来都没有变化，证人证明爆炸的火光是在空中，该地没有弹坑，可以肯定炮弹是在空中爆炸。在当地发现了新爆炸的炮弹弹片。证人在爆炸前听到来自东南方的“嘶”的声音。因此美方企图逃避责任的说法是不能成立的。朝中方面组员根据现场调查结果及证人证明，证实轰击桂湖洞我方非军事区的炮弹是从美方驻地射来，并将判语在二十七日提交军事停战委员会。
