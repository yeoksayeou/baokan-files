	Hegang Mining Bureau Completes Full-Year Tunneling Plan Ahead of Schedule
	The Hegang Mining Bureau under the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, on October 20th, completed its 1953 tunneling plan in full, two months and eleven days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 11.1%.
	Tunneling lagging behind extraction has been a historical problem in the entire coal mining industry. In the past, the idea that basic-level leaders of the Hegang Mining Bureau only valued production and neglected tunneling was very common. Some pit leaders even opposed tunneling to coal mining, believing that coal mining came first, rapid roadway development second, and tunneling third. Therefore, in the allocation of railway cars, tools, equipment, and machinery, the best were always allocated to the coal mining sites, while new and weak workers were assigned to tunneling sites. This spring, 50-60% of the bureau's tunneling sites were new workers, which often prevented some pit entrances from operating normally. In terms of technical management, tunneling sites did not have dedicated personnel in charge, and construction was not carried out according to the design. As a result, the quality of the projects was poor, resulting in widespread rework and waste. In order to reverse this idea and practice of only valuing production and neglecting tunneling, the bureau, starting this spring, with the cooperation of the Party, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League, vigorously publicized the importance of tunneling work, educating all employees to clearly recognize that tunneling is the "basic construction" of coal mining, and neglecting tunneling work means "living off the old capital." Administratively, the technical management of the tunneling sites was strengthened, and 28 trainee technicians were transferred to be specifically responsible for tunneling work. It was also emphasized that cyclical charts should be promoted in the main tunneling sites of each pit, and advanced experiences such as Cui Guoshan and Ma Liuhais' multi-hole operation and rapid tunneling should be promoted. These young trainee technicians were active and enthusiastic. For example, Feng Tianling and Jiang Dingfang, who were assigned to work in the Xing'an No. 1 pit, took shifts in the 501 site for more than ten consecutive days, helping new workers become familiar with drilling techniques and implementing cyclical charts. The Dongshan Yan Liting rapid roadway development team promoted phased blasting and wet rock drilling, and implemented a double mechanical drilling method, which improved work efficiency and exceeded the tunneling task every month. Therefore, from March onwards, the bureau's tunneling work performance gradually increased, and the cumulative tunneling work in the first half of the year was 108% completed, but the main roadways were only 74.2% completed, which means that the plans for many pit entrances were not realistic. At this time, the bureau further required each shift to prepare a daily work plan, develop charts, and establish and improve the responsibility system. It also transferred a group of technicians to serve as deputy squad leaders of the tunneling teams in each pit, enriching the basic-level organizations; and rewarded the advanced tunneling teams and groups, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. After the increase production and practice economy campaign was launched, all the bureau's tunneling teams and groups were involved in the competition. Sui Yongmao, the leader of the Xing'an rapid roadway development team, personally followed shifts to promote advanced experiences such as wet rock drilling and deep hole drilling, and created circulating vehicles to improve transportation efficiency; the rapid roadway development team led by Zhang Yidao in Nanshan promoted mud-core blasting, which saved more than 4,000 watts of explosives per meter of advancement on average. By the end of September, the bureau had maintained an average of more than seven months of recoverable reserves, and 33% of the preparatory working faces were ready. In the third quarter, the bureau, according to the instructions of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry on "vigorously grasping tunneling work," designated dedicated personnel from the bureau and mines down to the pits to be responsible for tunneling work, and stipulated that the bureau and mines should hold regular tunneling professional meetings to strengthen weak links and solve the difficulties and problems in tunneling work. The bureau also pointed out that wet rock drilling should be used in rock roadways above 30 meters, and hollow explosives and finished sheds should be widely used in other tunneling sites; and a "daily inspection and acceptance" system should be implemented. Each mine also promoted the shift handover system of the Xing'an pit; and established a special responsibility system for drilling, tool management, ensuring specifications, and shift handover. Due to the adoption of this series of measures, all 49 tunneling teams and groups (including 8 rapid roadway development teams) of the entire bureau, on October 20th, completed the full-year tunneling plan in full, two months and eleven days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 11.1%. The bureau plans to tunnel 17,548 meters in the fourth quarter. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the bureau will have an average of ten months of recoverable reserves, and the preparatory working faces will reach 55%, which will prepare favorable conditions for the production work in 1954.
	Currently, the problem existing in the bureau is that the progress is not balanced enough. Most pits have prepared more than six months of recoverable reserves. The Nanshan No. 4 pit has prepared the coal mining working faces for the entire year of 1954, but the continuation of individual pit entrance sites still has problems. The Mining Bureau is, according to the instructions of the local Party committee and the superior administrative leading organs, further reorganizing and enriching the tunneling teams and groups, preparing to establish 64 tunneling teams and groups (including 14 rapid roadway development teams). All employees are actively striving to complete the glorious task of tunneling 17,548 meters. (Wang Xunda)

### 鹤岗矿务局提前完成全年掘进计划

    鹤岗矿务局提前完成全年掘进计划
    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局鹤岗矿务局，于十月二十日，提前两个月零十一天，全面完成了一九五三年的掘进计划，并超过了百分之十一点一。
    掘进赶不上回采，在整个煤矿工业生产中是个历史性的问题。过去鹤岗矿务局基层领导干部只重视生产忽视掘进的思想很普遍，有的坑长竟把掘进和采煤对立起来，认为采煤第一，快速送道第二，掘进第三。因此在分配车皮、工具、器材、机械等，都尽先将好的分给采煤场子，新工人和老弱工人却分配给掘进场子。今年春季该局掘进场子有百分之五、六十是新工人，有的坑口因之常常不能正常作业。在技术管理上，掘进场子没有专人负责，不按设计施工，因此工程质量低劣，造成普遍的返工浪费现象。该局为了扭转这种只重视生产忽视掘进的思想和作法，自今年春季开始，党、工会、青年团共同配合，大力宣传掘进工作的重要性，教育全体职工明确认识掘进是采煤的“基本建设”，忽视掘进工作，就要“吃老本”。行政方面加强了掘进场子的技术管理，调配了二十八名见习技术员，专门负责掘进工作，并强调在各坑主要掘进场子推行循环图表，推广崔国山、马六孩的多孔作业、快速掘进等先进经验。这些青年见习技术员积极热情，如分配在兴山一坑工作的冯天龄、蒋定芳，接连十几天在五零一场子顶班，帮助新工人熟悉打眼技术，贯彻循环图表。东山阎立庭快速送道队推广了分期放炮、湿式凿岩；实行双机械打眼的方法，提高了工作效率，月月超额完成掘进任务。因此，该局从三月份起，掘进工作的成绩逐月上升，上半年累计掘进工作完成了百分之一百零八，但主要巷道只完成百分之七十四点二，这就是说，很多坑口的计划不切合实际。这时，该局又进一步要求每班编制日作业计划，制订图表，建立和健全责任制。又抽调出一部分技术员，担任各坑掘进班副班长，充实基层组织；并奖励了先进的掘进班、组，大大鼓舞了工人的积极性。增产节约竞赛开展后，该局所有掘进班、组，都卷入了竞赛运动，兴山快速送道队队长隋永茂，亲自跟班推广湿式凿岩、打深眼等先进经验，创造了循环车，提高了运搬效率；南山张义道领导的快速送道队，推广了泥心炮，平均前进一公尺可节省四千多瓦火药。到九月底止，该局平均已保持有七个月以上的可采获得量，已有百分之三十三预备工作面。第三季度，该局又根据中央燃料部煤矿管理总局关于“大力抓紧掘进工作”的指示，从局、矿一直到坑都指定专人负责掘进工作，规定局、矿要定期召开掘进专业会议，加强薄弱环节，解决掘进工作中的困难和问题。该局并指出在三十公尺以上的岩石巷道使用湿式凿岩法，其余掘进场可普遍使用空心炮和成品棚子；实行“日检收”制。各矿并推广了兴山坑的交接班制度；建立了打眼、工具保管、保证规格、交接班等专责制。由于采取了这一系列的措施，全局四十九个掘进班、组（包括八个快速送道队），在十月二十日，提前两个月零十一天，全面完成了全年掘进计划，并超过了百分之十一点一。该局计划在第四季度，掘进一万七千五百四十八公尺，预计到年底，全局平均可有十个月可采获得量，预备工作面将达到百分之五十五，这给一九五四年生产工作准备好有利的条件。
    目前该局存在的问题是进度还不够平衡，大部坑口准备了六个月以上的可采获得量，南山四坑已准备好一九五四年全年采煤工作面，但个别坑口场子接续还存在问题。矿务局正根据地方党委及上级行政领导机关的指示，进一步整顿和充实掘进班、组，准备成立六十四个掘进班、组（包括十四个快速送道队）。全体职工正积极为完成掘进一万七千五百四十八公尺的光荣任务而奋斗。（王训达）
