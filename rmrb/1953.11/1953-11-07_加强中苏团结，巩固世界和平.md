   Strengthen Sino-Soviet Unity and Consolidate World Peace
   Guo Moruo
    The great October Socialist Revolution achieved victory thirty-six years ago. The Soviet people, with their remarkable labor and wisdom, created and consolidated the proletarian dictatorship of the Soviet regime, brilliantly completed socialist construction, and are marching towards the most lofty ideal of mankind – a communist society. These brilliant achievements demonstrate the infinitely bright prospects of human society, and constantly inspire the struggle of working people around the world for freedom and happiness. We, the Chinese people and progressive humanity around the world, celebrate this great festival that marks the end of human prehistory with extreme excitement and joy.
    Since the birth of the Soviet state, the Soviet people have held high the banner of peace. This is the basic policy of national construction determined by the social system. The country of the people, who have become masters of their own destiny, demands a peaceful environment to unleash creative labor in order to raise the material and cultural living standards of the people. However, the inherently aggressive imperialists mistake the Soviet Union's peaceful policy for a sign of weakness and constantly adopt provocative policies and engage in actual aggression. Facts have proven that the imperialists have received the lessons they deserved more than once.
    Soon after the victory of the October Revolution, the armed intervention of fourteen capitalist countries was crushed by the heroic Soviet people. Especially in the Second World War, the Soviet people mainly relied on their own strength to thoroughly defeat the German, Japanese, and Italian Axis bandit gangs, saving the world's humanity from unimaginable fate. The great achievements of the Soviet people are evident to all.
    After the war, American imperialism inherited the traditions of the German, Japanese, and Italian Axis powers, attempting to dominate the world, pursuing a so-called "Cold War strategy," and constantly engaging in international provocations. The ambitions of American imperialists suffered a heavy blow in the East due to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, which was strongly supported by American imperialism, was crushed by the Chinese people, and the aggressive forces that American imperialism had fostered in mainland China for a century were eliminated by the Chinese people.
    Having suffered a disastrous defeat in mainland China, American imperialism arrogantly launched a war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our Taiwan, following in the footsteps of Japanese imperialism's "continental policy," attempting to annex Korea and then further invade mainland China to restore its lost control over mainland China. The three-year-and-one-month war, thanks to the joint efforts of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, once again dealt a similarly heavy blow to the ambitions of American imperialism.
    Today, all facts prove that the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown incomparably stronger. The victory of our Chinese People's Revolution was achieved through a long and arduous struggle, encouraged and assisted by the Soviet people. The people of China and the Soviet Union have a deep, long-term, and unbreakable fraternal friendship. This friendship has been solidified by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This friendship has proven to be not only a guarantee of peaceful construction and a happy life for the people of both countries but also a guarantee of peace in the Far East and international security.
    For thirty-six years, the Soviet government has consistently pursued a peaceful policy of international cooperation. Its recent great efforts to ease international tensions have been widely responded to and supported around the world. In capitalist countries, more and more people not only do not believe the "communist aggression" lies fabricated by war provocateurs, but also increasingly loudly voiced the call of "never fight against socialist countries." The efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire peace and democracy camp to strive for lasting peace and prevent new wars have achieved great success.
    Like the Soviet Union, our People's Republic of China announced our peace policy to the world from the very beginning of its establishment. The "Common Program" solemnly stipulates: "Unite with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially unite with the Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, stand on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly oppose imperialist aggression to ensure lasting world peace." The facts of the past four years have proven that we have adhered to this policy.
    Our Chinese People's Volunteers fighting abroad to aid the Korean people in resisting American aggression is a concrete manifestation of this policy. Our goal is to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, allowing the Korean people to handle Korean affairs themselves without foreign interference; thereby further seeking to guarantee peace in the Far East and world peace. The realization of the Korean armistice has brought about a preliminary easing of the international situation. Peace-loving people all over the world are increasingly convinced that any international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultations, and therefore the movement to hold consultations among the five major powers to ease the international situation is developing vigorously.
    However, American imperialists have consistently refused to learn their lesson. After repeated setbacks, they still do not easily abandon their policy of aggressive war, still attempt to maintain international tensions, and prevent the peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues. The performance in the East is particularly blatant. They attempt to tear up the Korean Armistice Agreement, are vigorously undermining the explanation work for non-repatriated prisoners of war, and obstructing the convening of political conferences; at the same time, they are stepping up the rearmament of Japan, reviving Japanese militarism. All this shows that American imperialists are continuing on a path of adventure.
    These developments increasingly demonstrate the importance and foresight of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance concluded three and a half years ago. The central task of our great alliance treaty is to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form in aggressive acts." The firm unity of China and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly the most reliable foundation for defending peace in the Far East and world peace.
    Our important task is to continuously strengthen our unity to consolidate the foundation of peace in the Far East and world peace. We thank the Soviet people and the Soviet government for their constant and selfless help to us. Our motherland has now embarked on the path of planned construction and development, and is gradually realizing the task of socialist industrialization. At this critical juncture, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have further provided us with comprehensive assistance, helping us build and renovate fifty major projects in the past three years, and will help us build and renovate ninety-one major projects in the future. In this way, our heavy industry will have a solid foundation in a few years.
    How should we, the Chinese people, repay the Soviet people? We will do our best to learn from the Soviet Union, learn the great spirit of socialist patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet Union, and learn the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in completing socialist construction. We will vigorously practice increasing production and practicing economy, accumulate funds for national construction to ensure the completion of national industrialization. We will improve our scientific research, strengthen our literary and artistic activities, and train a large number of technical talents to serve national construction. Only in this way can we live up to the great and selfless comprehensive assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet government. Only in this way can we be guaranteed to follow the general line of the transition period and complete the general task of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Only in this way can we play a more powerful role in consolidating the cause of world peace.
    I wish the fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union will develop eternally!
    I wish the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will be increasingly consolidated!
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live peace!

   加强中苏团结，巩固世界和平
   郭沫若
    伟大的十月社会主义革命获得了胜利已经三十六年了。苏联人民以卓越的劳动和智慧，创造了并巩固了无产阶级专政的苏维埃政权，光辉地完成了社会主义建设，而正在向着人类最崇高的理想——共产主义社会迈进。这辉煌的成就显示出人类社会无限美好的远景，不断地鼓舞着全世界的劳动人民争取自由和幸福的斗争。我们中国人民和全世界进步人类都以极其兴奋和愉快的心情，庆祝这一结束人类前史的伟大的节日。
    苏联人民自从苏维埃国家诞生之日起，便高举着和平的旗帜。这是社会制度所决定了的国家建设的基本方针。人民作了主人的国家要求在和平环境中发挥创造性的劳动，以提高人民的物质生活与文化生活的水平。然而，侵略成性的帝国主义者却把苏联的和平政策误认为软弱的表现，而不断采取着挑衅政策，并实际进行侵略。事实证明，帝国主义者是不仅一次地得到了所应得的教训的。
    十月革命胜利后不久，十四个资本主义国家的武装干涉，被英勇的苏联人民击溃了。特别在第二次世界大战中，主要就靠着苏联人民的力量彻底打败了德、日、意轴心匪帮，把世界人类从不堪设想的命运中拯救了出来，苏联人民的丰功伟绩是昭昭在人耳目的。
    大战后，美帝国主义继承了德、日、意轴心国的传统，妄图独霸世界，奉行着所谓“冷战战略”，而不断地进行国际挑衅。美帝国主义者的野心，由于中国人民革命的胜利，在东方遭受了沉重的打击。美帝国主义所大力支持的蒋介石傀儡政权被中国人民粉碎了，美帝国主义一百年来在中国大陆所扶植的侵略势力被中国人民肃清了。
    美帝国主义的侵略政策在中国大陆遭受了惨败，却狂妄地发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时并占领了我们的台湾，蹈袭日本帝国主义的“大陆政策”，想在吞并朝鲜之后，进一步侵略中国大陆，以恢复它失掉了的对于中国大陆的控制。三年另一个月的战争，由于英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的共同努力，使美帝国主义的野心又遭受了一次同样沉重的打击。
    在今天，一切的事实证明：以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量是无比地壮大了。我们中国人民革命的胜利，是在苏联人民的鼓舞和帮助之下，经过长期的艰苦斗争而获得的。中苏两国人民有着深厚的、长远的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。这一友谊已为中苏友好同盟互助条约所凝固。这一友谊已被证明不仅是两国人民和平建设与幸福生活的保障，而同时是远东和平与国际安全的保障。
    苏联政府，三十六年来是坚持不渝地采取着国际合作的和平政策的，最近为缓和国际紧张局势所作的巨大努力，在全世界范围内已获得广泛的响应和支持。在资本主义国家中，愈来愈多的人不仅不相信战争挑拨者所捏造的“共产主义侵略”的鬼话，而且愈来愈响亮地发出了“决不对社会主义国家作战”的呼声。苏联、中国和整个和平民主阵营为争取持久和平和制止新战争的努力是得到了巨大成就的。
    我们中华人民共和国和苏联一样，自建国之日起，便向全世界宣布了我们的和平政策。“共同纲领”中，庄严地这样规定着：“联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”四年来的事实，证明了我们是信守着这个政策的。
    我们的中国人民志愿军出国作战，援助朝鲜人民反对美国侵略，也就是这个政策的具体表现。我们的目的是争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，由朝鲜人民自己处理朝鲜问题，不受外国的干涉；由此，更进而求得远东和平与世界和平的保障。朝鲜停战的实现，使国际局势有了初步的缓和。全世界爱好和平的人民是愈加相信：任何国际争端都可以用和平协商的方式解决，因而要求举行五大国协商缓和国际局势的运动是日益蓬勃地展开了。
    但美帝国主义者却是始终不肯接受教训的。它在屡次挫败之后，依然不轻易放弃它的侵略战争政策，依然企图维持国际紧张局势，阻止国际间悬而未决的问题和平解决。在东方的表现是尤其露骨的。他们企图撕毁朝鲜停战协定，正极力破坏对未遣返战俘的解释工作，阻挠政治会议的召开；同时并加紧重新武装日本，使日本军国主义复活。这一切都说明着美帝国主义者在继续走着冒险的道路。
    这些情势的发展愈见证明了在三年半前所缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约的重要性与预见性。我们的伟大的同盟条约的中心任务，就是“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。中苏两国的坚强团结，无疑地是保卫远东和平和世界和平的最可靠的基础。
    我们的重要任务就是要不断地加强我们的团结，来巩固远东和平与世界和平的基础。我们感谢苏联人民和苏联政府经常不断地给予我们以伟大无私的帮助。我们的祖国目前已经走上了计划建设的发展路径，要逐步实现社会主义工业化的任务。苏联人民和苏联政府，在这紧要关头，又更进一步给予我们以全面的帮助，在过去三年已经帮助我们新建和改建五十项重大工程，今后又将帮助我们新建和改建九十一项重大工程。这样在几年之后，我们的重工业便会有坚实的基础了。
    我们中国人民将要怎样来报答苏联人民呢？我们将要尽力地学习苏联，学习苏联的社会主义的爱国主义与国际主义的伟大精神，学习苏联完成社会主义建设的宝贵经验。我们将要厉行增产节约，为国家建设积累资金，以保证国家工业化的完成。我们将要改进我们的科学研究，加强我们的文艺活动，培养大量的技术人才，来为国家建设服务。这样我们才可以不辜负苏联人民和苏联政府对于我们的伟大无私的全面帮助。这样我们才可以有保证地遵循着过渡时期的总路线，完成社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的总任务。这样我们才可以对于巩固世界和平事业发挥出更有力的作用。
    祝中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊永恒发展！
    祝以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营日益巩固！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    和平万岁！
