Commemorating Tchaikovsky
Zhao Feng

(I)
Chinese music workers commemorate the great Tchaikovsky by striving to learn from him and diligently studying Russian classical music.

Tchaikovsky worked tirelessly throughout his life. In his own words, "The responsibility of an artist is to never give up," and "An honest artist must never sit there with his arms crossed." As for inspiration, it is not "a guest who comes whenever called" [Note 1]. Creation is tireless "work," working like a "craftsman." Tchaikovsky began his brilliant musical creation life at the age of twenty-five. For nearly thirty years, he never ceased his work, constantly aware of his own shortcomings, striving to improve and compensate for them. We know that form—the elements of musical style—plays a greater role in musical creation than in other artistic creations, just as the element of form plays a greater role in poetry than in novels. Even in his later years, Tchaikovsky consciously worked hard to overcome the shortcomings in his creations, specifically his "failure to grasp musical style."

We also often see that some musical works fail to be memorable, one of the reasons being the failure to express moving musical images in a specific musical form, often resulting in fragmented and disjointed pieces. Of course, we are against primarily considering the structure of musical phrases, even at the expense of image and emotion. But the standard pursued by true masters is "doing as one pleases without overstepping the bounds." And this talent can only be acquired through arduous work.

(II)
Denying the function and role of music in social life and class struggle, formalist aesthetes say that music, unlike the visual arts, is dispersive. In fact, in literature and art, the factors that constitute an image are often multifaceted. In novels, the written descriptions that constitute an image can make people see the person as if they were in front of them and hear their voice as if they were next to them. Instrumental music, which depicts images purely through sound and without the aid of language, also appeals not only to people's sense of hearing. Throughout history, realist composers have insisted on the idea that music can express things. Tchaikovsky also adhered to the principle of program music in his creations. Consequently, regardless of how many people at the time looked down on ballet music, he wrote many beautiful, moving, popular, and easily understood ballets—Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty.... His contribution to opera music is great; he used music to create the immortal images of Tatyana and Lensky [Note 2] on stage. And in symphonic music, he successfully reached the highest peak of program music.

Regardless of Tolstoy's straightforward letter to him, advising him "not to follow the affected style of Beethoven—Schumann—Berlioz," the great Beethoven had a great influence on Tchaikovsky. His Fourth Symphony, as he confessed, "is in fact, this work is nothing but an imitation of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, not an imitation of its musical content; but in accordance with his basic idea." [Note 3] This, like his Sixth Symphony, is so moving because these two symphonies best illustrate his view of life. The biggest distortion of Tchaikovsky by bourgeois scholars is that he was a "pessimist." The title of the Sixth Symphony is "Pathétique" Symphony, and the content of its fourth movement is: "All joy is false, all victory is empty." [Note 4] But Tchaikovsky profoundly depicted the love of life in this music: the first movement first depicts the god of fate, but joy finally appears sweetly, confronting the seemingly inescapable misfortune; the second movement depicts the sweetness of memories, but people should not "regret the past" and should start life anew; in the final fourth movement, in his own notes, "Go to the people, how happy they are! You walk into these joys, and life becomes easier." [Note 5] His Sixth Symphony also runs through the same theme: there is unhappiness in life, but you cannot escape it, you must live bravely. That melody in the first movement is full of moving memories and emotions; that unusual five-beat rhythm in the second movement expresses the desire for joy; in the third movement, the author, with a brave heart, stretches his arms to the stormy sea, pursuing the joy of life that seems difficult to obtain but must be strived for eternally.

(III)
"As for saying that there is a Russian flavor in my works, that is correct. When I start writing, I often make up my mind to use one or two folk songs... because I... have been filled with the extraordinary beauty of Russian folk songs since childhood, so I extremely love every expression of the Russian soul. In short, I am a thorough Russian." [Note 6] Tchaikovsky's music is full of national and folk fragrance everywhere. One of its characteristics is rich melodiousness. The so-called innovation of modernists is, in fact, a kind of laziness, because the piling up of harmonies is much easier than conceiving a clear and meaningful melody. When Tchaikovsky criticized the opera of Berlioz, one of the composers he admired most, he pointed out that its main weakness was the poverty of melody and the excessive harmony. How many people later tried to remedy the poverty of melody with the rendering of harmony. But the most vivid depiction in music can only rely on melody. And harmony should always be subordinate to melody. One of the main reasons why Tchaikovsky was able to embody the nationality in his music was that he did not pursue those superficially gorgeous harmonies. He believed that when he conceived a melody, it was already accompanied by harmony, and he had even thought about which instrument it would appear on.

Tchaikovsky's music is the most melodic music. The Soviet critic Alshvang said: "Tchaikovsky's music is poetry. His vocal works, symphonies, quartets, and other instrumental music are all singable." [Note 7] It should be said that this has a great relationship with his careful study of Russian folk songs. And in this aspect of using folk songs as the material for his creation, he has left us with an excellent example. That famous "Andante cantabile," moved Tolstoy to tears; the folk song "Silver birch tree stands quietly in the field" quoted in the Fourth Symphony is so natural and vivid. He never quoted folk song melodies naturalistically; he always gave the quoted folk songs fuller emotions.

(IV)
Tchaikovsky's music is better appreciated and disseminated in the Soviet era. Tchaikovsky no longer has to worry: "Where can I find Tatyana?" Like Pushkin imagined, like the character I described in the music. Which actor can get slightly close to the ideal Tatyana? Where can I find a Lensky? [Note 8] The performances of Soviet opera actors have added new brilliance to the immortal images written by this master. The outstanding work of Soviet performers, singers, opera performers, and conductors has made us better acquainted with and understood this immortal master.

Editor's note: This month's sixth is the 60th anniversary of the death of the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky. On the ninth of this month, three groups—the Chinese Musicians Association, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Soviet Union's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries—will jointly hold a memorial meeting.

### 纪念柴可夫斯基

    纪念柴可夫斯基
    赵沨
    （一）
    中国的音乐工作者纪念伟大的柴可夫斯基，就要努力学习柴可夫斯基，努力学习俄罗斯古典音乐。
    柴可夫斯基终生不倦地工作着，用他自己的话说，“一个艺术家的责任就是永远不肯罢手”，“一个诚实的艺术家决不能交叉着手坐在那里”；而所谓灵感，也不是“一请就到的客人”〔注一〕，创作便是不倦的“工作”，“工匠”一样地工作。柴可夫斯基二十五岁开始他的灿烂的音乐创作生活，差不多三十年当中，他未曾中止过他的工作，并且时常觉察着自己的缺点，努力地锻炼和弥补着。我们知道，形式——乐式的因素在音乐创作中，比在其他艺术创作中所起的作用更大；正像在诗歌中，形式的因素较其在小说中所起的作用更大一样。柴可夫斯基直到晚年，还自觉地努力克服自己创作中“未能把握乐式”的缺点。
    我们也常见有若干音乐创作，其所以不能使人过目成诵，其原因之一便是未能将动人的音乐形象在一定的音乐形式中表达出来，往往支离破碎，漫无章法。当然，我们反对首先考虑乐句的起承转合，甚至因而牺牲形象和情绪。但真正的大匠所追求的规范是“随心所欲，不逾矩”。而这种才能也只有在艰苦的工作中才能获得。
    （二）
    否认音乐在社会生活、阶级斗争中的功能和作用，形式主义的美学家便说：音乐和造型的艺术相反，是流散的。事实上，在文学艺术中，使人构成形象的因素往往是多方面的。小说中构成形象的文字描写，可以使人闭目如见其人，侧耳如闻其声。单纯用声音描绘形象、不借助语言文字的器乐音乐，也不仅只诉之于人们的听觉。古往今来，现实主义的作曲家都坚持着音乐可以表达事物的主张。柴可夫斯基在创作中也坚持着标题音乐的原则，因而他不管当时有多少人轻视舞剧音乐，而写了许多美丽动人、通俗晓畅的舞剧——天鹅湖、睡美人……。他在歌剧音乐上的贡献是伟大的，是他用音乐创造了舞台上泰第安娜、连斯基〔注二〕的不朽形象。而在交响音乐中，也成功地达到了标题音乐的最高峰。
    不管托尔斯泰率直地写信给他，劝他“不要按照贝多芬——舒曼——裴辽士的矫揉造作的风格”，但伟大的贝多芬对于柴可夫斯基有着极大的影响。他的第四交响乐，如他自白，“事实上，这部作品不过是模仿贝多芬的第五交响乐写的，不是模仿他的音乐内容；而是按照他的基本思想。”〔注三〕这和他的第六交响乐一样，其所以那么动人，是因为这两首交响乐最好地说明了他对生活的主张。资产阶级的学者们对柴可夫斯基的最大的曲解是说他是个“厌世主义者”，第六交响乐的标题叫做“悲怆”交响乐，其第四乐章的内容是甚么：“一切的喜悦都是假的，一切的胜利都是空的。”〔注四〕但柴可夫斯基在这音乐中深刻地描写了对生活的热爱：第一乐章中首先描写了命运之神，但欢喜终于甜蜜地出现了，和看来无可逃避的不幸对抗着；第二乐章描写了回忆的甜蜜，但人们不应“悔恨过去”，应该重新开始生活；到了最后的第四乐章，用他自己的注释，“到人民中去吧，他们是多么快乐啊！你走进这些快乐中去，于是生活就变得好受了。”〔注五〕他的第六交响乐也贯串着同一的主题：生活中是有不幸的，但不能逃避它，要勇敢地去生活。那第一乐章中充满着动人的回忆的情感的曲调；那第二乐章中表现对喜悦的渴望情感的不平常的五拍子的节奏；那第三乐章，作者以勇敢的心胸，把手臂伸向暴风雨的大海，追求那看来很难得到但要永恒去争取的生活的欢乐。
    （三）
    “至于说我的作品里面有俄罗斯气味，这是不错的，我开始写的时候，往往打定主意要利用一两首民歌……因为我……从儿童时代就装满了一肚子的俄国民歌的出奇的美，因此我极端爱好俄国灵魂的每一种表现。总之，我是一个彻头彻尾俄罗斯人。”〔注六〕柴可夫斯基的音乐处处充满着民族的和民间的芬芳，其特点之一便是丰富的曲调性。现代主义者的所谓革新，事实上是一种懒惰，因为和声的堆砌较之构思一个明晰的有内容的曲调是容易得太多了。柴可夫斯基批评他最崇拜的作曲家之一裴辽士的歌剧时，便指出其主要的弱点是曲调的贫乏和过度的和声。后来的多少人企图用和声的渲染来补救曲调的贫乏啊。但音乐中最形象地刻划只能指靠曲调。而和声，永远是应从属于曲调的。柴可夫斯基所以能在他的音乐中体现了民族性的一方面，其主要的原因之一便是他不追求那些虚有其表的华丽的和声。他认为，当他构思一首曲调时，便已经伴随着和声，甚至已经想好了在那一件乐器上出现了。
    柴可夫斯基的音乐是最富曲调性的音乐。苏联的批评家阿尔什万说：“柴可夫斯基的音乐就是诗。他的声乐作品，交响乐，四重奏和其他的乐器音乐都是可歌唱的。”〔注七〕应该说：这和他精心地研究俄罗斯民歌有极大关系。而在他利用民歌作为他创作的素材的这一方面，更给我们留下了极好的典范。那有名的“徐缓似歌的行板”，曾使托尔斯泰感动得流泪；第四交响乐中引用的民歌“银色的白桦树在田间静静地站立着”，是那么自然而生动。他绝不是自然主义地引用些民歌曲调，他总是赋予引用的民歌以更丰满的感情。
    （四）
    柴可夫斯基的音乐在苏维埃时代得到更好的欣赏和传播。柴可夫斯基再也不必担心：“我在什么地方找得到泰第安娜”呢？要如普希金想像中的，要如我在音乐上所描写的人物啊。有那一个演员能够稍微接近理想的泰第安娜呢？什么地方可以找到一个连斯基呢？〔注八〕苏维埃歌剧演员们的表演对这大师写下的不朽形象更增加了新的光彩。苏维埃的演奏家、演唱家、歌剧演出家、指挥家们卓越的工作，使我们更好地亲近、了解了这位不朽的大师。
     编者按：本月六日是俄罗斯伟大作曲家柴  可夫斯基逝世六十年纪念日，本月九日，中国  音乐家协会、北京市中苏友好协会和苏联对外文化协会三团体，将联合举行纪念会。
