    Jilin Province Jinhai Guan Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Sells All 300,000 Jin of Surplus Grain to the State
    All members of the Jinhai Guan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sijianfang Village, Jilin City, Jilin Province, decided to sell 300,000 jin of rice to the state, using practical actions to support the state's general line during the transition period.
    The Jinhai Guan Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in the spring of this year. The cooperative has 24 households and 34 hectares and 1.9 fen of paddy fields. This year, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, they unified the management of the land, absorbed advanced experience in high-yield rice production, effectively utilized the productive capacity of the land and labor, and overcame disasters such as insects, floods, and frost, thereby achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of rice. The yield of rice per hectare reached 14,213 jin, and the total harvest of rice for the cooperative was more than 480,000 jin. Each member can receive more than 50 jin of rice per work day.
    Just as the members were celebrating the harvest and busy threshing, Jin Haiguan, the director of the Agricultural Production Cooperative, returned from a meeting held by the district People's Government and conveyed the state's general line for the transition period to the entire cooperative. After listening to the report, the members saw the bright future of the country more clearly, and they said with joy: This is another great happy event after the joyous event of the bumper harvest!
    The Jinhai Guan Agricultural Production Cooperative held two discussion meetings. Li Sulong, the deputy director, said excitedly at the meeting: "We have lived well by listening to the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Five years ago, which family in our cooperative had not eaten bean cakes! Who would have thought that we would have such a good life today! In 1948, when the People's Government called on us to organize, I didn't expect so many benefits. Today, everything is clear. Without developed industry, it is difficult to greatly improve agricultural production. Although we put in a lot of effort for this year's bumper harvest, the more than 2,500 jin of fertilizer provided by the state also played a big role; if we had new farm tools, tractors... how great that would be!" Member Jin Jixie said: "The happy life of socialist society is in sight, it depends on how we do it!" Member Pu Luhua said: "Empty talk will not lead to socialist society, we must take practical actions. We farmers should work hard to produce and sell all our surplus grain to the state."
    After discussion, all members unanimously agreed to sell all 300,000 jin of surplus rice to the state. It is estimated that these rice can be sold for 244 million yuan. They plan to use more than 130 million yuan to buy vehicles, cattle, fertilizers, etc., and repay state loans, and deposit the remaining money in the state bank.

    吉林省金海官农业生产合作社
    把三十万斤余粮全部卖给国家
    吉林省吉林市市郊四间房村金海官农业生产合作社全体社员，决定卖给国家三十万斤稻谷，用实际行动拥护国家过渡时期的总路线。
    金海官农业生产合作社是今年春天建立起来的。全社二十四户，有三十四垧一亩九分水田。今年他们在人民政府领导帮助下，统一经营土地，吸取了先进的水稻丰产经验，有效地发挥了土地和人力的生产能力，战胜了虫、水、霜等灾害，因而得到了空前的水稻大丰收。每垧水稻产量达到一万四千二百一十三斤，全社共收稻谷四十八万多斤。社员们每个劳动日可分到稻谷五十多斤。
    正当社员们喜庆丰收忙着打场的时候，农业生产合作社主任金海官由区人民政府开会回来，向全社传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线。社员们听了传达报告以后，对国家将来的美好远景看得更清楚了，都欢欣鼓舞地说：这是丰收喜事之后的又一件大喜事！
    金海官农业生产合作社开了两次座谈会。副主任李诉龙在会上兴奋地说：“我们是听共产党和毛主席的话过好了的。五年前，咱社谁家没吃过豆饼！谁想到会有今天这样的好日子！一九四八年，人民政府号召组织起来时，我也没想到有这么多好处，今天想想什么都清楚了。工业不发达，农业生产就很难大大提高。今年丰收虽然我们使了很大气力，国家贷给的两千五百多斤肥田粉也起了很大作用；假如有了新农具、拖拉机……那多带劲呀！”社员金基燮说：“社会主义社会幸福的生活摆在眼前，这就看咱们怎么干啦！”社员朴鲁化说：“空口说白话到不了社会主义社会，咱们得拿出实际行动来。没别的，咱们农民就应该努力生产，把余粮全部卖给国家。”
    经过讨论，全体社员一致同意把余粮三十万斤稻子全部卖给国家。约计这些稻子可卖二亿四千四百多万元，他们计划除用一亿三千多万元买车、牛、肥料等和归还国家贷款外，把剩余的钱都存到国家银行里去。
