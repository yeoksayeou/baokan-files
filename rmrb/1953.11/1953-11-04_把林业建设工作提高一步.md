    Further Improve Forestry Construction Work

    The nation's planned economic construction requires forestry to develop in accordance with industry and agriculture. China's forest area is too small and its distribution is inappropriate, far from meeting the needs of national construction. To fundamentally change this situation, we must mobilize the broad masses to consciously, voluntarily, and persistently participate in forestry construction work. The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Mobilizing the Masses to Carry Out Afforestation, Forest Cultivation, and Forest Protection Work" on September 30 this year. Currently, autumn and winter afforestation, forest cultivation, and forest protection work are being actively carried out in various places. Earnestly implementing the Government Administration Council's instructions in these efforts will lay a solid foundation for the development of China's forestry construction.

    China's forestry construction has made considerable achievements in the past three or four years. According to existing statistics, afforestation has reached approximately 1.75 million hectares nationwide, and mountain closure for forest cultivation covers 4.14 million hectares. In the Northeast and Northwest, the construction of large-scale protective forest belts has begun, and newly planted trees in many barren mountains and sandy lands have begun to play a role in conserving water and soil and preventing wind and sand. Various damages to mountain forests are decreasing year by year. This is the result of the attention paid to forestry work by Party and government organs at all levels and the considerable efforts contributed by the broad masses in forestry construction. It is also due to the hard work of many forestry workers who work tirelessly in the wind-swept wilderness and uninhabited deep mountains. All of this is undoubtedly commendable.

    Forestry construction is a century-long plan for the country. Considering the fundamental needs of the production and life of all the people, and considering the long-term interests of the people, we must do our utmost to ensure that the area of ​​forests can meet the needs of the country and the people within a certain period. Forestry cadres and people in forest areas contribute their labor for this long-term interest, which is of great significance. China needs to afforest a very large area, including a considerable portion of privately owned land; we do not yet have a large number of machines for afforestation; we cannot form a large number of workers who specialize in forestry work, and can only use the spare labor of farmers to do this work. Therefore, whether it is afforestation, forest cultivation, or forest protection, we must rely on the broad masses, especially the broad masses of farmers; we must adapt to the current interests of the masses, and not harm the current interests of the masses. When the long-term interests necessitate harming the current interests of some of the masses, appropriate compensation must be given. At the same time, we must always pay attention to the fact that the private and decentralized nature of the small-peasant economy is detrimental to planned economic construction; with the development of various national construction undertakings, the small-peasant economy must be gradually transformed.

    Based on the current specific situation, to give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses for forestry construction and gradually implement the socialist transformation of farmers in forest areas, the following aspects should be noted:

    First, it is necessary to conduct constant political and ideological education among the peasant masses. Restricted by the conditions of the small-peasant economy, the peasant masses are not easily able to see the long-term or the big picture. We have a responsibility to make the peasant masses see the future benefits and collective benefits. Forestry work cannot be seen as merely planting and cutting down trees, but all opportunities should be used to educate the masses in light of their specific ideological situation. It is necessary to make the masses understand that afforestation, forest cultivation, and forest protection are for the interests of the country and also for the long-term interests of the masses. Although afforestation may not bring immediate benefits, it can bring huge benefits in the future. The protective forests in eastern Henan and western Hebei have shown their effectiveness in just a few years, which is a clear example. Although the effects of cultivating timber forests are slower to appear, they are even more needed for long-term benefits.

    The forest industry departments should also educate forestry cadres and workers that, for the long-term interests of the country and the people, timber harvesting work must be closely combined with forest cultivation work. They should not only seek the convenience and labor-saving aspects of current harvesting, but also neglect the need for long-term nurturing of new forests. In harvesting operations, some mother trees should be left appropriately, and the forest farms should be cleared immediately during harvesting to create conditions for the natural regeneration and artificial replanting of forests. The cleared areas formed by forest fires should also be investigated and cleared in a timely manner; areas where natural regeneration methods cannot form forests should be supplemented by artificial or replanting according to the specific situation.

    Second, it is necessary to implement policies that are conducive to long-term forestry construction and do not harm the current interests of the masses. According to the instructions of the Government Administration Council: in terms of afforestation, the principle of "whoever plants owns, whoever plants together owns together, and whoever plants by the village owns by the village" should be implemented. Mutual-aid afforestation and cooperative afforestation should be promoted step by step and under leadership, and at the same time, attention should be paid to giving play to the enthusiasm of farmers for individual afforestation; when establishing forestry mutual-aid and cooperative organizations, the principle of voluntary mutual benefit must be strictly observed. All mountains and forests that should be distributed to farmers for individual, joint, or village collective ownership according to law should be distributed as soon as possible based on local historical customs and current conditions; if there are disputes over the distributed mountains and forests, the farmers should be led to negotiate and adjust based on the spirit of unity and mutual assistance; farmers have the right to freely harvest, use, and sell the mountains and forests that have been distributed to them and the mountains and forests that they originally owned, and no one may interfere. In private forest areas in the south, timber transactions under strict national management should be carried out within a certain scope, and correct price policies should be implemented at the same time. On the one hand, encourage the enthusiasm of private individuals to engage in forestry, and on the other hand, prevent the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging. In minority areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, the ownership and logging rights of mountains and forests should be effectively protected according to local original customs. Because the situations vary from place to place, the Government Administration Council authorizes local governments to formulate specific implementation methods for these policies; however, the principles of the Government Administration Council's instructions cannot be violated.

    Third, it is necessary to adopt forestry work leadership methods suitable for the current rural situation. In order to overcome the decentralization and blindness of the rural economy, and in order to gradually incorporate the basically decentralized forestry construction into the track of the national plan, forestry construction should be carried out in a planned manner; at the same time, it must also be noted that when formulating plans, it is necessary to act according to one's ability, and it must be suitable for the different climates, soils, terrains, tree species, etc. of each region, taking into account the local people's inherent habits, living needs, and production capacity. Whether it is afforestation, forest cultivation, or forest protection, we should try our best to rely on the masses to come up with ideas, and find good methods that can both guarantee the long-term interests of the country and the people and adapt to the current interests of the masses and are readily accepted by the masses. In the work of closing mountains for forest cultivation, different methods should be adopted for different seasons and different trees to take care of the needs of the masses for firewood collection, grazing, and hunting, and mountain closure for forest cultivation should not be done mechanically, nor should mountains only be closed without forest cultivation. The correct methods that should be adopted in afforestation, forest cultivation, and forest protection have been clearly stipulated in the instructions of the Government Administration Council; all localities should combine these regulations with their local specific conditions and resolutely implement them.

    It should be correctly recognized that the relationship between forestry and other production and construction undertakings is very close. At present, in afforestation and forest protection work, forestry and agriculture rely on the same team, so forestry is an inseparable part of the entire rural economy. In some places, forestry workers in semi-forest areas and key afforestation areas do not use the existing production committees and agricultural mutual-aid and cooperation organizations, but want to do a separate set of work in isolation, and do not take care of agricultural seasons in their work; in this way, forestry and agriculture are actually opposed. This is detrimental to both agriculture and forestry. On the other hand, after implementing the policy of "agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural work," some cadres in some areas have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards forestry work: some places have missed the opportunity for afforestation; some places do not seriously arrange forest protection work during the fire prevention season; some places have completely abandoned leadership after distributing mountains and forests to the masses, and there have been phenomena such as indiscriminate logging, only closing mountains without cultivating forests, and no education is given to the masses. This is also wrong. The instructions of the Government Administration Council say: "When arranging rural work, governments at all levels should include forestry work as a necessary content, and make unified plans and unified arrangements. Any practice of carrying out forestry work in isolation, or canceling forestry work when implementing the policy of 'agricultural production overriding everything,' is not correct." Party committees at all levels in all regions, especially in semi-forest areas and key afforestation areas, should grasp this principle, so that forestry work and agricultural work are closely coordinated, and promote the development of forestry in accordance with industry and agriculture.

    In the future, there are more favorable conditions for carrying out mass-based forestry construction work: land reform has been basically completed nationwide, and most of the mountains and forests that should be distributed to the masses have been distributed; after half a year of implementing production policies and overcoming the phenomenon of "too many tasks," the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses has been greatly improved; the instructions of the Government Administration Council have more clearly pointed out the path for forestry construction work, and encouraged the forestry workers to advance. Forestry workers and all comrades related to forestry work should study the instructions of the Government Administration Council carefully, combine them with the various documents on rural work issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in recent years, conduct in-depth research, review past work, overcome some shortcomings and errors in the work, and further improve forestry construction work.

### 把林业建设工作提高一步

    把林业建设工作提高一步
    国家有计划的经济建设，需要林业与工业、农业相适应地发展。我国森林面积过小而且分布不适当，远不能适应国家建设的需要。要从根本上改变这个情况，必须发动广大群众自觉自愿地、坚持不懈地参加林业建设工作。中央人民政府政务院已在今年九月三十日发布了“关于发动群众开展造林、育林、护林工作的指示”。现在，各地的秋冬造林、育林、护林工作正在积极进行。在这些工作中切实执行政务院的指示，就会给我国林业建设的发展奠定一个可靠的基础。
    我国林业建设在三四年来已有相当成就。根据现有统计，全国造林约达一七五万公顷，封山育林四一四万公顷，在东北和西北已开始营造了较大面积的防护林地带，不少荒山沙地上新造的树林已开始发生保持水土、防御风沙的作用，山林所受的各种损害正逐年减少。这是各级党政机关对林业工作的重视和广大群众在林业建设方面贡献了相当大的力量的结果，也是在风沙漫天的荒原上和没有人迹的深山中不辞劳苦地工作着的许多林业工作者的劳绩。这一切无疑地都是值得赞许的。
    林业建设是国家的百年大计，从全体人民的生产和生活的根本需要着想，从人民的长远利益着想，我们必须尽最大努力争取在一定的时期使森林的面积能适应国家和人民的需要。林业干部和林区人民为了这长远的利益而贡献出自己的劳动，是有重大意义的。我国需要造林的地区非常广大，其中还包括着相当大的部分为私人所有的土地；我们还没有大量供造林用的机器；我们还不可能组成大批的专门从事林业的工人的队伍，只能运用农民的业余的劳动力来做这个工作。因此，不管是造林、育林、护林，都必须依靠广大群众，特别是要依靠广大农民群众；必须适应群众当前的利益，不妨害群众当前利益。为了长远利益的需要，不得已而妨害了部分群众当前利益时，必须予以适当的补偿。同时，也必须时时刻刻注意到，小农经济的私有性和分散性对于有计划的经济建设是不利的；随着国家各项建设事业的发展，对于小农经济必须逐步地加以改造。
    根据目前的具体情况，要发挥广大群众对于林业建设的积极性并逐步地对林区农民实行社会主义改造，应当注意以下几个方面：
    第一，要对农民群众经常地进行政治思想教育。农民群众受小农经济条件的限制，不容易看得长远，不容易看到全局。我们有责任使农民群众看到将来的利益和集体的利益。不能把林业工作只看成栽树砍树的工作，而应利用一切机会，结合群众的具体思想情况，对群众进行教育。要使群众了解：造林、育林、护林是为了国家的利益，也是为了群众的长远的利益。造林虽然一时不能得利，将来却可以得到巨大的利益。豫东、冀西的防护林，没有多少年便显示出了功效，便是明显的例子。营造用材林的效果虽然要来得慢些，但是，它更是为长远的利益所需要的。
    森林工业部门也应当教育林业干部和工人，为了国家人民的长远利益，要把采伐工作和育林工作密切结合起来，不要只图目前采伐的方便、省工，而忽略了长期抚育新林的必要。在采伐作业中，应当适当地留下一些母树，并在采伐时随即清理林场，给森林的天然更新和人工补种创造条件。对于因森林火灾而形成的迹地，也应及时加以调查、清理；凡用天然更新方法不能成林的地区，应按照具体情况辅以人工或重新造林。
    第二，要贯彻执行利于长期性的林业建设也不妨害群众当前利益的政策。根据政务院的指示：在造林方面，要实行“谁种谁有，伙种伙有，村种村有”的原则。要提倡有步骤地有领导地互助造林、合作造林，同时应注意发挥农民个体造林的积极性；在建立林业的互助合作组织时，要严格遵守自愿互利的原则。一切依法应当分配给农民个人所有、伙有或村公有的山林，应当根据各地原有历史习惯和现实情况，尽快加以分配；已分配而有纠纷的，应领导农民本着团结互助的精神协商调整；已分配给农民的和农民原有的山林，农民本人均有自由采伐、使用和出卖的权利，任何人不得干涉。在南方私有林地区，应在一定范围内进行在国家严格管理下的木材交易，同时实行正确的价格政策。一方面鼓励私人经营林业的积极性，一方面防止引起滥伐林木的现象。在还没有实行土地改革的少数民族地区，对于山林的所有权和采伐权，应根据当地原有的习惯切实加以保护。因为各地情况不同，对于这些政策的具体实施办法，政务院授权各地政府制定；但政务院指示的原则是不能违反的。
    第三，要采取适合当前农村情况的林业工作领导方法。为了克服农村经济的分散性、盲目性，为了把基本上还是分散进行的林业建设逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，林业建设应当有计划地进行；同时，也必须注意，在制定计划时要量力而行，一定要适合各个地区不同的气候、土壤、地形、树种等情况，照顾当地群众固有的习惯、生活的需要和生产的能力。不论造林、育林、护林，都应当尽量依靠群众出主意，找出既能保证国家和人民的长远利益又能适应群众当前利益并且为群众所乐意接受的好办法来。在封山育林工作中，要分别不同季节、不同林木，采取不同的办法，照顾群众樵采、放牧和狩猎的需要，而不应机械地封山育林，也不应只封山而不育林。在造林、育林和护林工作上应当采取的正确的方法，政务院的指示中已经作了明确的规定；各地应当把这些规定和当地具体情况结合起来，坚决贯彻执行。
    应当正确地认识，林业和其他生产建设事业的关系是非常密切的。而目前的造林护林工作中，林业和农业所依靠的又是同一个队伍，因之森林事业乃是整个农村经济的不可分的一部分。有些地方林业工作者在半林区和重点造林地区的农村中，不利用已有的生产委员会和农业互助合作组织，而要孤立地单搞一套，在工作中也不照顾农事季节；这样就在实际上把林业和农业对立起来。这对农业和林业都是不利的。另一方面，在贯彻“农业生产是农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务”的方针以后，有些地区的干部对林业工作又采取了放任自流的态度：有些地方错过了造林的时机；有些地方在防火季节也不认真布置护林工作；有些地方把山林分给群众后就完全放弃领导了，发生了滥伐乱砍、只封山不育林等现象也不对群众进行教育。这也是不对的。政务院的指示中说：“各级政府在布置农村工作时，应将林业工作列为应有内容，并作统一计划和统一安排，任何孤立地开展林业工作，或在贯彻‘农业生产压倒一切’方针时，取消了林业工作的做法，都是不应该的。”各个地区、特别是半林区和重点造林地区的各级党委，应掌握这个原则，使林业工作和农业工作密切配合进行，推动林业和工农业相适应地发展起来。
    今后开展群众性的林业建设工作已经有了更加有利的条件：全国范围内土地改革已经基本完成了，大部应分给群众的山林已经作了分配；经过半年来贯彻生产政策，克服“五多”现象，农民群众的生产积极性已经大大提高；政务院的指示，更明确地给林业建设工作指出了道路，鼓舞了林业工作者前进的力量。林业工作者和一切与林业工作有关的同志，都应该好好地学习政务院的指示，把它和中共中央近年来发布的关于农村工作的各项文件结合起来，作深入的研究，检查过去的工作，克服工作中的某些缺点和错误，把林业建设工作提高一步。
