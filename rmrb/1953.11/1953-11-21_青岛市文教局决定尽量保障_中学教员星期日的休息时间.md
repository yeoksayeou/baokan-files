    Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Education and Culture Decides to Guarantee Middle School Teachers' Sunday Rest Time as Much as Possible
    Letter from the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Bureau of Education and Culture: The criticism of us by a group of middle school teachers in Qingdao, published in the "Abstracts of Readers' Letters" column on August 24, is correct. In the past, we have indeed not paid enough attention to the issue of guaranteeing middle school teachers' Sunday rest time as much as possible. According to the teachers' study plan in the last semester, inspirational reports were required when teachers studied Kairov's Pedagogy. However, due to the two-shift system in various middle schools in the city, it was impossible to find a unified time on weekdays, so it was necessary to use Sunday rest time; it was determined at that time to only use it three times. But later, according to the unified arrangements of the city, another Sunday was used for reports (actually, the publicity outline had been distributed to all schools). When the Minister of the Student Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League came to Qingdao, we felt that it was very necessary for teachers to understand the issue of ideological education for students, so we invited him to give a report on Sunday. After the Qingdao Municipal Secondary School Visiting Group visited Beijing, we organized another report. In addition, our planning was not strong, and the last report was made during the general review of the semester, when teachers were very busy. In particular, the quality of our own reports was not high and the time was too long, which made the teachers dissatisfied.
    We are determined to change this situation. This semester, we plan to use only three Sundays for inspirational reports on Party history learning (uniformly stipulated by the province), and strive to improve the quality of the reports and shorten the report time as much as possible, so that teachers can gain something after listening to the reports without excessively affecting their rest.

    青岛市文教局决定尽量保障中学教员星期日的休息时间
    青岛市人民政府文教局来信：八月二十四日“读者来信摘要”栏中刊载的青岛市一群中学教员对我们的批评是正确的。过去我们对于尽量保障中学教师星期天有休息时间的问题，确实注意不够。按上学期教师学习计划，在教师学习凯洛夫教育学时需要做启发性的报告。但本市各中学都有二部制，平日找不出统一时间，不得不占用星期天休息时间；当时确定只占用三次。但后来根据全市统一布置，又占了一个星期天作报告（实际上宣传提纲已发到各学校）。在山东省青年团工作委员会学生部部长来青岛时，我们觉得对学生进行思想教育的问题很需要使教员了解，就请他在星期天作了一次报告。本市中等学校参观团赴北京参观后，我们又组织了一次报告。加上我们计划性不强，作最后一次报告，正在学期总复习的时候，教师很忙。特别我们自己的报告质量不高，时间较长，因而使教员们不满意。
    我们决心改变这一情况。本学期计划只占用三个星期天作有关党史学习（省统一规定）的启发报告，并且尽可能地提高报告质量，缩短报告时间，使教员听报告后有收获，又不致过多影响休息。
