Confession of Lieutenant James E. Gentry Jr., Pilot of the 37th Bombardment Squadron, 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force

    I am Lieutenant James E. Gentry Jr., service number AO-1909980, born in South Charleston, West Virginia on November 6, 1927. I joined the U.S. Air Force in April 1949 and arrived in Korea in February 1952. I was assigned to the 37th Bombardment Squadron, 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing as a pilot. On June 7, 1952, I and my crew, Lieutenant Penney and Lieutenant Hanmer, were shot down in North Korea and captured by the Korean police.

    I carried out two types of bacteriological warfare missions—Joint Operations Center special missions and what we called "Squadron Plan" missions.

    Joint Operations Center special missions were directly and completely controlled by the Fifth Air Force Joint Operations Center. We had to go from our base to another base to receive briefings and load bombs.

    On April 15, 1952, I was notified to report immediately to the Group Operations Section to prepare for a combat mission. When I and my crew arrived at the Group Operations Section, we were instructed to proceed immediately to K-46 base for a special mission of the Joint Operations Center. We estimated that this was an emergency target, so we ran to our plane and flew to K-46 base at maximum power.

    We landed there at 3:00 PM, but received the unexpected notification to wait until 9:00 PM to receive the briefing. We reported to the base Operations Section at 9:00 PM. Ten minutes later, a major came in and immediately dismissed all other staff in the room. He began to brief us in a very simple and clear manner:
    “Your plane has been loaded with four five-hundred-pound bomb-sized bacteriological bombs… Drop these bombs near Tonghua, about forty miles inside Manchuria.”

    Then he explained that due to enemy radar, we should fly as low as possible on the way to and from the target. He gave us the flight route—from K-46 base to K-47 base to Cheorwon to Wonsan to Hamhung to Changjin Lake at an altitude of 7,000 feet, then continue to fly at low altitude to Tonghua. We would return via the same route and report at K-46 base. The major also talked about other intelligence necessary for our mission. We walked to the plane and found that the bomb bay doors were already closed. But due to the major's urgency and the approaching flight time, I did not pay attention to this. I only quickly checked the plane. I started the engine and taxied the plane to the takeoff position, but I was still thinking about what the major had said: "If you are hit inside Manchuria, drop the bacteriological bombs immediately and tell your captors that it was because you were lost."

    We flew over K-47 base and Cheorwon, and saw the searchlight lights clearly indicating the front line. We could see the rockets flying and the parachute flares slowly sinking to the ground. Suddenly the lights disappeared, and we were flying over enemy territory. We continued along the prescribed route, crossing Changjin Lake, where I lowered the plane to the lowest altitude that would still allow me to fly safely among the mountains. I turned off most of the lights in the cockpit to avoid dazzling the navigator and myself.

    The navigator was searching the map. Suddenly, he said, "The Yalu River!" Yes, the Yalu River was lying there. We had just glanced at the river and found ourselves in China.

    Only the regular rhythm of the engine broke the silence of the night. The silence of the crew was understandable, because we had entered airspace that we should not have entered. Our attitude was to remain silent so that the Chinese would not know we were there.

    The situation in China was different. Towns and villages were lit up, and vehicles were also turned on. Suddenly the navigator told me that we were approaching the target, so I accelerated and climbed to 6,000 feet. When we were flying over a river that ran across our target from northeast to southwest, the navigator found the exact location. The city of Tonghua was brightly lit, showing a complete target. When I was about ten miles southwest of the target, I adjusted the bombsight and opened the bomb bay doors, notifying the crew that we were starting the bomb run, then accelerated and dived towards the target. I leveled off about 500 meters above the valley floor, then reduced power and glided the plane towards the brightly lit city. On the southwest side of Tonghua we dropped the bacteriological bombs. I accelerated again, closed the bomb bay doors, and pointed the nose towards the sky. As we climbed steeply upwards, the city immediately disappeared, narrowly missing a mountain.

    I flew back towards the return route. The navigator reported: "No explosion seen". This was the only thing said in a few minutes. I descended to low-altitude flight again. When we flew over the Yalu River again and returned to Korea, suddenly, we all breathed a deep sigh of relief. Although Korea did not welcome us, at least they expected us to come.

    My short-range operator said a few heartfelt and sincere words. He expressed disgust at this mission. When we reached Changjin Lake, I ascended to the prescribed altitude, and we returned to normal.

    At K-46 base, as soon as we got off the plane, the major who briefed us asked us for a report. After that we flew back to our base at K-9.

    Around April 25, 1952, I was notified to report to the Group Operations Section, where Group Briefing Officer Major Friesen told us: "You have been selected to undertake a very special mission, which is to drop the four bombs under your wings on a predetermined target." He continued: "Due to the special nature of these bombs, under no circumstances should they be brought back to South Korea." He said that if the engine failed during takeoff, it would be better to steer the plane out to sea rather than use the normal emergency procedure of retracting the landing gear on the runway, and it was imperative to fly the plane into the sea, rather than dropping the bombs in friendly territory.

    I asked him why he was wasting my plane and crew like this. He did not answer. He gave me the coordinates of the target and warned me to say that we were attacking "an ammunition depot or warehouse or something similar" when telling the crew.

    But just as we were about to leave, Major Friesen said to me in a very friendly or comrade-like manner: "We have received intelligence that there is an epidemic in North Korea. Tonight you will carry bacteriological bombs to help it along."

    My crew was:
    Navigator: Lieutenant Bobby E. Hanmer, short-range operator Warrant Officer Fazio, mechanic Robert M. Halstead, Airman Second Class. I gave the coordinates and said we were going to drop our underwing bombs there, but don't ask any questions.

    We took off at 10:00 PM and flew straight to the target, dropping four underwing bombs. The navigator reported that two exploded and two did not. The bacteriological bombs were dropped near Sinŭiju.

    Around May 1, I attended a meeting where Captain Jackson briefed a group of pilots about the mission of dropping "special" bombs on predetermined targets and told us that the coordinates of the targets will be given on the day of the mission. This is the so-called "Squadron Plan" mission being carried out. He told us to say that this mission was to attack vehicles when reporting. Later, the same officer, Captain Jackson, frankly told me: The "Squadron Plan" mission, which actually started in late April, was a bacteriological warfare mission.

    I flew about eight "Squadron Plan" missions. These missions were flown about every three days, with dates roughly around April 28, 30, May 2, 5, 8, 19, 22, and 25, 1952. The bacteriological bombs were all dropped in areas such as Sinxi, Ichon, Suan, Kurri, Yangdok, and Kangdong. A typical example was around May 25, 1952, which Captain Jackson briefed as "another weeding out mission." He repeated that when the plane malfunctions during takeoff, it must be steered out to sea, rather than retracting the landing gear on the runway. Hanmer and Penney flew with me that day. We were briefed for a regular blockade mission. Later, I conveyed the coordinates of my bacteriological target. The mission was carried out normally. I heard "Bombs Away" in the intercom, and four bacteriological bombs were dropped in the Suesan area.

    We continued our usual missions of bombing and strafing vehicles, and reported on our "unexploded bombs" on the way back.

    In a private conversation with Captain Jackson, he told me that we had dropped plague germs in the entire area of the Wing's operations. He told me that he was one of a group of personnel trained in bacteriological warfare, and he had the special task of bringing the squadron plan to us.

    美国空军第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉小詹姆士·埃·耿诺的供词
    我是小詹姆士·埃·耿诺中尉，军号A O—1909980，一九二七年十一月六日生于西弗吉尼亚州南查理斯敦城，一九四九年四月我参加美国空军，一九五二年二月间抵达朝鲜，分派至第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七轰炸机中队为驾驶员。一九五二年六月七日我与同机组人员潘尼中尉、汉麦中尉在北朝鲜被击落，为朝鲜警察所俘。
    我执行过两种细菌战任务—联合作战中心特殊任务和我们所谓的“中队计划”任务。
    联合作战中心特殊任务是由第五航空队联合作战中心直接和完全控制的，我们必须自我们基地至另一基地接受简令和装载炸弹。
    一九五二年四月十五日，我接到通知立即向大队作战科报到，以准备一次战斗任务，当我和我的机组到达大队作战科时，接到指示要我们立即前往K —46基地，担任一次联合作战中心之特殊任务，我们估计这是一个紧急目标，故跑向我们的飞机，以最大动力向K —46基地飞去。
    我们于午后三时在那里降落，但接到出乎意外的通知，要我们等到下午九时才接受简令。我们在下午九时向基地作战科报到，十分钟后，一个少校来了，他立即将房内之所有其他工作人员打发走，他开始以极简单的明了的方式向我们发布简令：
  “你们的飞机内已装好四个五百磅炸弹大小的细菌弹……把这些炸弹投在位于满洲境内约四十英里之通化附近。”
    接着他说明由于敌方的雷达，我们在往返目标的途中要尽可能低飞，他给予我们飞行路线——以七千英尺高度自K —46基地至K —47基地至铁原至元山至咸兴到长津湖，然后继续以低空飞向通化，我们将以同一路线返回在K —46基地汇报，该少校又谈了些对我们任务上所必需的其他情报，我们就走向飞机，发觉弹舱门已经关好，但由于该少校急迫的态度和我们飞行时间的逼近，我没有注意这件事，只很快地对飞机作了一次检查，我发动了引擎，将飞机滑至起飞位置，但我仍在思索该少校所说的话：“假如你们在满洲境内被击中，立即投下细菌弹，并告诉你们的俘获者，这是由于你们迷途之故。”
    我们飞过K —47基地和铁原，看见了清楚指示着战线的探照灯灯光，我们能够看到火箭的飞射和徐徐向地面飘沉的降落伞照明弹，突然间灯光消失了，我们是飞行在敌人之领土上空，我们继续沿规定路线前进，越过了长津湖，在该处我将飞机下降至使我在群山间仍能作相当安全飞行之最低高度，我关掉座舱上大部分的灯光，以免使领航员和我自己感到眩目。
    领航员把地图搜索着，突然间，他说：“鸭绿江！”是的，鸭绿江躺在那里，我们刚刚看了一下这条江便置身在中国了。
    只有引擎有规则的节奏打破了夜间沉静，机组人员的静默是可以了解的，因为我们进入了不应进入的领空，我们的态度是保持安静，使中国人不知道我们是在那里。
    在中国情况是不同了，城镇和村庄都点燃着灯火，车辆也都开亮了灯，突然间领航员对我说我们正飞近目标，故我开足动力，上升至六千英尺，当我们飞临一条横贯我们目标、自东北流向西南之河流时，领航员找到确实的位置，通化城灯火通亮，显出了一个完整的目标，当我们距目标西南约十英里处我拨正投弹器和开启弹舱门，通知机组人员我们正开始作投弹飞行，于是开足马力，向目标俯冲。我在距山谷谷底约五百公尺上空恢复平飞，然后减低马力，并将飞机滑翔至该灯火通亮之城市，在通化之西南边我们投下了细菌弹，我再度开足马力，关闭弹舱门，将机头朝天飞去，当我们向上急升高时，城市马上消失了，险些儿碰上一座山。
    我向回程方面飞行，领航员通知说：“看不到爆炸”，这是几分钟内所说的唯一的话，我又下降至低空飞行，当我们再度飞越鸭绿江回到朝鲜时，突然间，我们都深深地松了一口气，虽然朝鲜并不欢迎我们来，但至少料到我们是会来的。
    我的短航操作员说了几句衷心而诚恳的话，他表示厌恶这个任务，当我们到达长津湖时，我升至规定高度，我们又恢复正常了。
    在K —46基地，当我们一下飞机，那个对我们简令的少校就向我们要汇报的情况。之后我们飞回我们在K —9的基地。
    在一九五二年四月二十五日前后，我接到通知到大队作战科报到，在那里大队简令官弗里生少校告诉我们说：“你们已被挑选来担任一项极其特殊的任务，就是将你们机翼下的四枚炸弹投在一个预定目标上。”他继续说：“由于这些炸弹的特殊性质，在任何情况下都不准将其带回南朝鲜”，他说一旦在起飞时引擎发生故障，宁可将飞机驶向海上而不应用在跑道上缩回起落轮的正常紧急程序，并且一定要把飞机飞向海中，而不要把炸弹投在友区。
    我问他为什么要这样浪费我的飞机与机组，他没回答，他给了我目标的座标，并警告我在告诉机组人员时应说我们是袭击“一个军火库或仓库或其他类似的东西”。
    但正当我们要离开时，弗里生少校以很友善或同伴的态度对我说：“我们接到情报说北朝鲜发生疫病，今晚你们将要携带细菌弹帮助它一下。”
    我的机组人员是：
    领航员：鲍贝·埃·汉麦中尉，短航操作员法齐奥尉官，机械士罗勃特·麦·哈尔斯蒂德二等航空兵，我交代了座标，并说我们要将我们的翼下炸弹投在那里，但不要问任何问题。
    我们在下午十时起飞，直向目标飞去，投下四枚翼下炸弹，领航员报告有二枚爆炸，二枚不爆炸，细菌弹被投在新溪附近。
    约在五月一日我参加了一次会议，由杰克逊上尉向一组驾驶员作在预定目标投掷“特殊”炸弹的任务之讲解，并告诉我们目标的座标会在任务的当天给予，这就是正在执行的所谓“中队计划”任务，他告诉我们汇报时说这种任务是攻击车辆的任务。以后同一军官杰克逊上尉直率地对我说：实际上在四月下旬已开始的“中队计划”任务，就是细菌战任务。
    我约飞过八次“中队计划”任务。这些任务约三天飞行一次，日期大致是一九五二年四月二十八日、三十日、五月二日、五日、八日、十九日、二十二日、二十五日。细菌弹全投在新溪、伊川、遂安、栗里、阳德与江东等地区。其中典型的一次是约在一九五二年五月二十五日左右，这就是杰克逊上尉简令所说的“另一次铲除任务”。他重复说道，当飞机在起飞时发生故障，必须将其驶向海中，而不要在跑道上缩回起落架。那天与我同飞的有汉麦中尉和潘尼中尉，我们被简令作一次普通的封锁任务，后来我传达了我的细菌目标的座标，任务执行情况正常，我在机内通话器中听到“投弹”，四个细菌弹就投落在遂安地区。
    我们与平常一样地继续我们轰炸和扫射车辆的任务，并在回来时，就我们“不爆炸的炸弹”进行报告。
    在与杰克逊上尉一次私人谈话中他告诉我，我们已在整个联队活动地区投下鼠疫菌，他对我说他是一批受过细菌战训练人员中的一个，他有将中队计划带给我们的特殊任务。小詹姆士·埃·耿诺（签名）美国空军中尉军号A O —1909980北朝鲜一九五二年七月二十八日（新华社）（附图片）
