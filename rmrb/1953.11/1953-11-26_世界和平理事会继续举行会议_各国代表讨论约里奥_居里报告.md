Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 25th: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the evening of November 23rd and the morning of November 24th, with representatives from various countries speaking on Joliot-Curie's general report.

　　After listening to Joliot-Curie's report and passing the meeting's agenda at the November 23rd meeting, World Peace Council Vice-Chairman Nenni addressed the meeting. He paid tribute to the outstanding peace fighter Yves Farge, pointing out that the danger of war has diminished today, but the situation has not fundamentally changed. We must organize a broad movement to oppose the "European Defence Community," and peace-loving people from all countries must participate in this movement. Nenni concluded by saying that peace forces are constantly growing stronger, and solidarity with the people of China, Korea, and Vietnam is strengthening throughout Asia. The achievements of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies give us new strength. We believe that peace can be achieved because we have the ability to win peace.

　　De Chambren, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, then spoke on the peaceful settlement of the German question. He pointed out that the Soviet government's proposed method of peacefully unifying Germany and prohibiting the rearmament of West Germany is entirely in the interests of all peace-loving people. He said that the World Peace Council should point out to the people of all countries that resolving the German question on the basis of Soviet proposals is entirely possible, and rejecting the Paris and Bonn treaties will help avoid war and ease international tensions.

　　Pritt, President of the British Peace Committee, pointed out the specific goals and tasks of the British peace movement in his speech. He said that the British peace movement has had a significant impact on shaping public opinion against war and war preparations and in favor of negotiation.

　　Vietnamese representative Le Dinh Tham pointed out that the war of aggression against Vietnam is contrary to the interests of the French people. The signing of the Korean armistice agreement has strengthened the confidence of the French and Vietnamese people, as well as people around the world, that a peaceful solution to the Vietnam question is possible. He called on the participants of the meeting to condemn the actions of the US and French imperialists in expanding and prolonging the Vietnam War, and to organize a powerful movement to strive for a cessation of the war and a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam question.

　　At the meeting on the morning of November 24th, the first speaker was Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association and member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. Mao Dun pointed out that the Korean armistice is a major victory for the world's peace forces. It has created favorable conditions for further easing international tensions. However, the United States is still trying to maintain an unstable state of the Korean armistice. The United States is obstructing the work of explaining to prisoners of war and obstructing the convening of a political conference. Mao Dun then expressed his hope that peace-loving people all over the world would promote a ceasefire in Vietnam and a peaceful solution to the Vietnam question. He pointed out that in order to consolidate peace and security in the Far East, the Japanese question should be resolved rationally. Mao Dun finally called on peace-loving people to strive for the early convening of a five-power conference to negotiate and resolve international disputes.

　　Han Xueye, the representative of the heroic Korean people, then spoke, pointing out that despite the various conspiracies of the US reactionary group and the Lee Seung-man group, the Korean people are sparing no effort to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean question. The political conference must reach an agreement on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. He said: We reiterate that the Korean question should be resolved by the Koreans themselves, and foreign countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people. Because neutral countries are concerned about the resolution of the Korean question, we request that countries like the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma be invited to participate in the work of the political conference.

　　Japanese representative Tan Tokusaburo pointed out in his speech that Japan is intensifying its armament. He said that Japan's policy of re-militarization is being met with increasingly strong resistance from the Japanese people. The movement of the Japanese people demanding the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the Korean people is unfolding. He said: The Japanese people are willing to support all measures aimed at easing international tensions. He finally said: Japan is raising funds to assist the people of Korea who have suffered from war disasters, and he, on behalf of the Japanese delegation, suggested launching a movement in various countries to assist the Korean people.

　　Soviet representative Ilya Ehrenburg then spoke. He said that in the year since the World People's Peace Congress, the forces of peace have grown. But the danger has not been eliminated. The clamor for openly advocating a new war has not subsided. Ehrenburg pointed out that Dulles and some politicians have changed their tune. While stepping up war preparations, building new military bases, and increasing the troops under their control, they keep talking about "negotiations" and "guarantees." These politicians now have to put on a hypocritical face, which proves that peace advocates are powerful, but it would be the greatest misfortune for people all over the world to relax their vigilance because of this.

　　Ehrenburg said that American politicians are doing everything possible to prevent the legitimate representatives of China from attending the United Nations and preventing China from establishing peaceful relations with other countries. Some politicians suggest holding consultations on the German question while resolutely demanding the speedy ratification of the Paris and Bonn treaties. This duplicity can be clearly seen by anyone.

　　Ehrenburg concluded by saying: The resolution passed by our meeting should help ease international tensions and be acceptable to all peace-loving people and patriots of any country. People of all countries are waiting for us to speak, and now politicians in all countries have to take us into account. We have forced many of them to talk about peace, and we will also force them to support peace in action.

　　West German representative Wilhelm Elfes said: The unified and democratic reconstruction of Germany cannot be achieved peacefully according to the plans of Washington and Bonn. The World Peace Council has advocated another method at previous meetings; this method, which has also been put forward in the Soviet notes, is: to promote the unification of Germany on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement, through understanding between the great powers and between the Germans themselves, and through free all-German elections. Elfes concluded by saying: West German peace advocates will intensify their propaganda work among the people and intensify the struggle for peace in order to do everything possible to turn Germany into a peaceful country.

　　Minaert-Colin, the representative of the Dutch peace fighters, spoke in detail about the attitude of the broad strata of the Dutch people towards the German question. She said that we should explain to the masses that the "European Defence Community" treaty means the re-militarization of West Germany. She announced that the Dutch Peace Council has decided to convene a national conference against German militarism in Amsterdam in January 1954.

　　Czechoslovak representative Hodinova-Spurna pointed out that the re-militarization of West Germany is the greatest threat to the survival of Czechoslovakia, and all the Czechoslovak people are participating in the struggle against the revival of militarist Germany. She called on the representatives attending the World Peace Council meeting to strengthen the movement in various countries to strive for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

　　The last speaker was Indian representative Govind Sahai. He said that the United States' policy is aimed at creating a new war. Therefore, anti-American sentiment is growing among the Indian people, while sympathy for China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries is growing day by day. He said that without the participation of the great China in international conferences, all efforts to ease international tensions will be in vain.

　　Govind Sahai pointed out that the United States is creating tensions between India and Pakistan. The US government pretends to be a friend of India, but behind its back it is an enemy of India.

    世界和平理事会继续举行会议
    各国代表讨论约里奥—居里报告
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十五日讯：世界和平理事会二十三日晚间和二十四日上午继续举行会议，各国代表就约里奥—居里的总报告发言。
    二十三日会议在听取了约里奥—居里的报告并通过了会议的议程以后，世界和平理事会副主席南尼向会议致词。他向杰出的和平战士伊夫·法奇致敬，他指出：战争的危险今天已减少了，但是局势没有根本改变，我们必须组织一个广泛的运动来反对“欧洲防务集团”，各国爱好和平的人民必须参加这个运动。南尼最后说：和平力量正在不断壮大，和中国、朝鲜与越南人民的团结一致正在亚洲各地增强，非洲的被压迫人民正在加入争取和平、反对备战的斗争。苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的成就给了我们新的力量，我们相信和平能够实现，因为我们有能力赢得和平。
    世界和平理事会书记处书记德香布兰接着就和平解决德国问题发言，他指出：苏联政府建议的和平统一德国的办法和禁止重新武装西德，是完全符合全体爱好和平的人民的利益的。他说：世界和平理事会应当向各国人民指出，在苏联建议的基础上解决德国问题是完全可能的，拒绝巴黎和波恩条约，将有助于避免战争和使得国际紧张局势缓和。
    英国和平委员会会长普里特在发言中指出了英国和平运动的具体目的和任务，他说：英国的和平运动，在形成反对战争和战争准备、争取协商的舆论上，产生了极大的影响。
    越南代表黎廷探指出：侵略越南的战争是违背法国人民的利益的，朝鲜停战协定的签订，加强了法国和越南人民以及全世界人民认为可能和平解决越南问题的信心。他号召参加会议的人谴责美法帝国主义者扩大和延长越南战争的行动，并组织一个强大的运动，来争取停止战争与和平解决越南问题。
    在二十四日上午会议上，第一个发言的是中国作家协会主席、世界和平理事会常务委员会委员茅盾。茅盾指出，朝鲜停战是世界和平力量的重大胜利。它已经为进一步缓和国际气氛创造了有利的条件。但是，美国仍在企图使朝鲜停战保持不稳定的状态。美国正在阻挠战俘听取解释的工作，阻挠政治会议的召开。茅盾接着表示希望全世界爱好和平的人们促成越南的停战和越南问题的和平解决。他指出，为了巩固远东的和平与安全，应该合理地解决日本问题。茅盾最后号召爱好和平的人民为促成五大国会议的早日召开以协商解决国际争端而奋斗。
    英勇的朝鲜人民的代表韩雪野接着发言，他指出：尽管有美国反动集团和李承晚集团的种种阴谋，朝鲜人民正不遗余力谋求和平解决朝鲜问题。政治会议必需就外国军队撤出朝鲜及和平统一朝鲜问题达成协议。他说：我们再次声明，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人自己来解决，外国不得干涉朝鲜人民的内政。由于中立国家关心朝鲜问题的解决，我们要求邀请像苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、缅甸这样的国家参加政治会议的工作。
    日本代表淡德三郎在发言中指出，日本正在加紧武装。他说，日本重新军国主义化的政策遭到日本人民日益强烈的反抗。日本人民要求和苏联、中国和朝鲜人民建立友好关系的运动正在展开。他说：日本人民愿意支持一切旨在缓和国际紧张局势的措施。他最后说：日本正在筹募款项援助朝鲜受到战争灾害的人民，他代表日本代表团建议在各国展开一个援助朝鲜人民的运动。
    苏联代表伊利亚·爱伦堡接着发言。他说：世界人民和平大会以后的一年中，和平力量是增长了。但是危险还未消除。公然主张进行新战争的叫嚣并没有平息。爱伦堡指出，杜勒斯及有些政治家已经改变了调子。他们一方面加紧战争准备，建立新军事基地，增加他们控制下的军队，一方面却不停地说着“谈判”和“保证”。这些政治家现在不得不摆出一副假惺惺的面孔，这证明和平拥护者是有力量的，但全世界人民若因此放松警惕，那就是他们最大的不幸。
    爱伦堡说，美国政治家千方百计地阻挠中国的合法代表出席联合国并阻挠中国和其他国家建立和平关系。某些政治家一方面建议举行关于德国问题的协商，同时又坚决要求尽速批准巴黎和波恩条约。这种口是心非的态度是任何人都可以清楚看出的。
    爱伦堡最后说：我们这次会议通过的决议应当有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，并为一切爱好和平的人和任何一个国家的爱国者所能接受。各国人民在等待着我们说话，现在一切国家的政治家都不得不考虑到我们了。我们已经迫使他们之中许多人不得不谈和平，我们也将迫使他们在行动上赞成和平。
    西德代表威廉·艾尔费斯说：按照华盛顿和波恩的计划，决不能和平地重建统一与民主的德国。世界和平理事会在历次会议上，就主张用另一种方法；苏联的照会里也提出过的这种方法是：以波茨坦协定为基础，通过大国之间和德国人彼此之间的谅解，通过自由的全德选举来促成德国的统一。艾尔费斯最后说：西德的和平拥护者将加紧对人民的宣传工作和加紧争取和平的斗争，以竭尽所能把德国变成一个和平国家。
    荷兰和平战士的代表明纳特—柯林详细谈到了荷兰广大阶层的人民对德国问题的态度。她说，我们应该向广大群众说明，“欧洲防务集团”条约意味着西德重新军国主义化。她宣布：荷兰和平理事会已决定在一九五四年一月在阿姆斯特丹召开反对德国军国主义的全国性的大会。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表霍迪诺娃—斯普尔纳指出：西德重新军国主义化对捷克斯洛伐克的生存，是最大的威胁，所有的捷克斯洛伐克人民都参加了反对军国主义德国复活的斗争。她呼吁参加世界和平理事会会议的代表们，在各国加强争取建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国的运动。
    最后发言的是印度代表戈文德·萨海。他说：美国的政策是以制造新战争为目的的。因此，印度人民中间反美情绪日益增长，而对中国、苏联和其他爱好和平国家的同情却一天天增强。他说，没有伟大的中国参加国际会议，将使一切缓和国际紧张局势的努力归于无效。
    戈文德·萨海指出：美国在制造印度和巴基斯坦间的紧张关系。美国政府装作是印度的朋友，但在背后却是印度的敌人。
