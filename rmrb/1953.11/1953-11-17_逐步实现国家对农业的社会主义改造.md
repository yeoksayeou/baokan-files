Gradually Realize the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture
    Sha Ying

    I. Why the State Should Implement Socialist Transformation of Agriculture
    The Party's general line and general task during the transition period, in rural areas, is to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. So, why should socialist transformation be carried out in agriculture? The basic situation of China's agriculture at present is still the dominance of small-scale peasant economy, that is, farmers engaged in manual labor, like a sheet of loose sand, with each household being a production unit, using animal power and old-fashioned farm tools, carrying out individual production on small plots of land. The characteristic of this backward and scattered small-scale peasant economy is its instability and inability to fully utilize technology, machines, tractors, and the achievements of agricultural science. Comrade Stalin said in his report at the meeting of activists of the Leningrad Party Committee on July 13, 1928: "What is small-scale peasant economy? It has very little commodity economy, very little income, and relatively more natural economy, with only 12 or 13 percent as commodities." However, we want to realize national industrialization. With the increasing development of national industry, the urban population will increase greatly, and the need for commodity grain and industrial raw materials will continue to grow rapidly. However, the small-scale peasant economy cannot adapt to this need. At the same time, the development of industry requires a vast domestic market, but the farmers of the small-scale peasant economy are very poor, and their purchasing power is very low. From this perspective, the small-scale peasant economy cannot adapt to the needs of industrial development either. In this regard, Stalin pointed out in "On National Industrialization and the Right Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)": "If industry is the brain, then agriculture is the foundation of industrial development, because agriculture is the market for selling industrial products, the supplier of raw materials and grain, and the source of export goods. We must have export goods in order to import machinery for the needs of the national economy. If we let agriculture remain in a state of complete technical backwardness, without securing industry with an agricultural foundation, without transforming agriculture, and without bringing it closer to industry, can we promote the advancement of industry? Absolutely not."
    According to the Marxist theory of reproduction, modern society cannot develop without annually increasing accumulation, and annually increasing accumulation cannot be achieved without annually expanding reproduction. Our country's industry is developing in accordance with the Marxist theory of expanded reproduction, so its capacity is increasing year by year, it has its own accumulation, and it is advancing very rapidly. However, the small-scale peasant economy, which accounts for a large proportion of our national economy, is not developing according to the principle of expanded reproduction. Most of it cannot achieve expanded reproduction year by year. However, various departments of the national economy must have certain proportional relationships, and there must be a correct contrasting relationship between industry and agriculture. If we base ourselves on the small-scale peasant economy, can we accelerate the industrialization of our country? That is absolutely impossible.
    Lenin and Stalin taught us that the problem of socialist economic construction is the problem of organizing the entire national economy, including both cities and rural areas, both industry and agriculture. The close integration of these two economies is the foundation of socialist economy. Without this integration, socialism cannot be realized. This is not only because agriculture provides industry with grain, raw materials, and markets, and industry provides farmers with industrial products and machines to transform agriculture, so the integration of industry and agriculture is needed. Moreover, socialism as an economic system cannot be built on two directly opposed and mutually exclusive foundations: on the one hand, centralized socialist large-scale industry in cities, and on the other hand, scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy in rural areas. If this is the case, there is a danger of rupture in the relationship between cities and villages, industry and agriculture, and the entire national economy may disintegrate one day. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his speech at Sverdlov University in 1925: "A socialist society is a production and consumption combination formed by workers in industry and rural economy. If the industrial combination does not have close ties with the rural economy that supplies raw materials, grain, and consumes industrial products, if industry and rural economy cannot become a unified whole national economy, then there is no socialism. Therefore, the issue of the relationship between industry and rural economy and the issue of the relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry become a fundamental issue in building a socialist economy." Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Without agricultural socialization, there will be no complete and consolidated socialism."
    Therefore, in order to adapt to the development of national industry, it is necessary to transform the small-scale peasant economy into a huge agriculture, making it an agriculture that can accumulate and achieve expanded reproduction. However, to transform the small-scale peasant economy standing at the "crossroads" into a huge agriculture, there are two roads to take: one is the capitalist road, and the other is the socialist road. The former road is to cultivate capitalism in rural areas, causing a deep polarization of farmers. Except for a few speculators and exploiters who become the bourgeoisie, the vast majority of farmers will fall into a state of poverty of being exploited and enslaved. The latter road is to cultivate collective farms and state-owned farms in rural areas, resulting in the union of small farmers into huge collective farms armed with new technologies and science, enabling the vast majority of farmers to live an increasingly prosperous and civilized life. What should we do? We cannot allow our rural economy to stagnate in the small-scale peasant economy for a long time, nor can we allow the small-scale peasant economy to spontaneously take the capitalist road. We should carry out socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy and let them take the socialist road. This is the only way to make farmers get rid of poverty and become prosperous together. Only by taking this road can we place the worker-peasant alliance on a more solid economic foundation.
    At the same time, it should be particularly pointed out that in a large country like ours, where the small-scale peasant economy occupies a large advantage and the agricultural population is large, and the development of national industry will be very rapid while the development of the small-scale peasant economy is very slow, the socialist transformation of agriculture is of more serious significance and is an extremely arduous task.

    II. Developing the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement is the Only Way to Transform Agriculture
    Since socialist transformation is necessary, how should it be carried out? Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the laboring peasants cannot be expropriated, and they can only be united step by step to take the road of cooperativization and collectivization. Stalin pointed out in the "Short Course of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)": "Lenin believed that the general cooperative system, especially the agricultural cooperative system, is a road for millions of peasants to easily accept and understand from small individual farms to large-scale joint cultivation production unions, that is, to collective farms." This instruction is also fully applicable to us. As early as ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his famous speech "Get Organized!": "On the part of the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been individual economy, with each household as a production unit. This decentralized individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into perpetual poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee have also specifically instructed us that the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country must, in accordance with the principle of farmers' voluntariness, take the road of developing mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually replace the current individual private ownership of land by farmers with collective ownership of land, that is, to realize agricultural collectivization or socialization. This is to gradually change the relations of production and gradually change the ownership system. Only by implementing this transformation can we implement agricultural mechanization in the future, can we develop agricultural productive forces on a large scale, increase agricultural output, and distribute according to the principle of "distribution according to work," so as to adapt to the needs of national industrial development and further improve the lives of farmers. The countryside is a vast battlefield. If socialism does not occupy it, capitalism will. That is to say, if socialist transformation is not carried out in the countryside, and socialism is not increased at all times, and the development of capitalism is allowed to develop, it is very dangerous, and it is impossible to build socialism. Therefore, proposing the slogan of "ensuring" the private ownership of farmers' means of production is wrong. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated in its resolution on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production: "The Central Committee of the Party has always believed that in order to overcome the difficulties faced by many farmers in decentralized management, to enable the vast number of poor farmers to rapidly increase production and embark on the road to a well-fed and well-clothed life, and to enable the country to obtain much more commodity grain and other industrial raw materials than it does now, and at the same time to increase the purchasing power of farmers, so that the country's industrial products can obtain a vast market, it is necessary to promote 'organization' and develop the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This kind of mutual aid and cooperation is now a collective labor based on individual economy (based on farmers' private property), and its development prospect is agricultural collectivization or socialization."
    To implement socialist transformation of farmers requires gradual transformation over a fairly long period. Because our country is a country where small-scale peasant economy occupies a huge advantage, and the agricultural population is more than 470 million. To complete the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy in such a large country with a large agricultural population, and our industry cannot produce a large number of tractors and agricultural machines in a short period, and the awareness of farmers also needs to be gradually improved through long-term education, of course, it is not an easy task and cannot be accomplished overnight. Therefore, the only correct road is to start from the basic situation of the small-scale peasant economy, and according to objective conditions and subjective forces, actively lead and steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and gradually transition to large-scale production and mechanized collective farms with complete socialism. This policy of "gradual transformation" must not be shaken. Otherwise, if it is not gradual transformation, it will be rash and adventurous; if transformation is not actively carried out, it will be laissez-faire.
    At present, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production by farmers in various places has various different historical and complex forms with the development of the rural economy and production requirements in various places, but there are roughly three main forms. The first is simple labor mutual aid, which is the most elementary, mainly temporary and seasonal, and generally small-scale. The second is year-round mutual aid teams, which are a higher form than the first form. In this form, some implement the combination of mutual aid in agriculture and sideline production; there are certain simple production plans, and then gradually combine labor mutual aid with improving technology; there is some technical division of labor; some mutual aid teams gradually set up some public farm tools and livestock, and accumulated a small amount of public property. The third is agricultural production cooperatives, or land cooperatives. This form is usually developed on the basis of a better mutual aid and cooperation movement, and is the current advanced form of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production. This form, in addition to including and developing the characteristics of mutual aid teams' joint labor, also adds an important feature of land shares, which can reasonably unify the use of means of production (land, livestock, farm tools, etc.), and can also reasonably unify the use of labor, thus forming a more diverse division of labor, and can gather more funds to invest in technological transformation and agricultural infrastructure, which makes its productivity greatly exceed the level that mutual aid teams can achieve, thereby enabling it to further develop towards a prosperous life. However, this is still an agricultural production cooperative based on private ownership of land. The use of land shares is also based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and shares can be withdrawn according to the principle of voluntariness.
    The steps that our mutual aid and cooperation movement should take are generally from small to large, from low-level to high-level, entirely based on the voluntariness of the farmers. That is to say, first organize mutual aid teams with the nature of socialist budding; further organize and guide farmers to join semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives; in the future, we can further build fully socialist production cooperatives (that is, collective farms) and supply and marketing cooperatives to realize collective production and a prosperous life. That is to say, proceed step by step, transition gradually, and persevere to the end. Of course, in the specific implementation in various places, they are not necessarily clearly divided, nor are they necessarily uniformly progressing step by step. The mutual aid and cooperation movement is advancing on a specific and tortuous road, and we must not attempt to mechanically apply an abstract formula. At the same time, when developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, we must also break the idea that the newly liberated areas must develop slowly. In fact, in the newly liberated areas with many favorable conditions, such as good natural conditions, relatively concentrated population, higher cultural level of the masses, especially strong local cadres who can correctly grasp policies, some newly liberated areas may exceed some old liberated areas.
    Under current conditions, to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement, in addition to striving to develop, consolidate, and improve mutual aid teams, we must also vigorously strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives are and will become the main form of transforming agriculture. Because it has a "good direction, high yield, and high income," it plays a banner role for farmers. Running agricultural production cooperatives well can drive the great development of mutual aid teams, so they must be developed in a led and planned manner, and only good ones are allowed, and bad ones are not allowed. If they are run badly, it will waste the farmers' energy, reduce grain production, and have a very bad political impact, which is not beneficial to the country or the farmers. To develop agricultural production cooperatives, we should achieve a large number, high quality, and no waste products, which is a healthy development.
    In addition, we must also plan to establish a number of state-owned farms with mechanized and semi-mechanized farming and some state-owned farms of the nature of agricultural experimental farms, on the one hand, to educate all farmers with the examples of the superiority of this modern farm of improving agricultural technology and using new farm tools; on the other hand, to provide technical assistance and guidance to agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives according to possible conditions. At the same time, in places where farmers fully agree and have appropriate economic conditions, a small number of collective farms of a socialist nature can also be tried out in order to gain experience and provide demonstrations for farmers. As for individual farmers, we must also take care of and help them with full enthusiasm, patiently educate them, and never discriminate or ridicule them, and never rudely frustrate their enthusiasm for individual economy. In this way, it is possible to gradually join the mutual aid and cooperation organization in the future. It is also possible to realize our final goal in the countryside—to guide all farmers to socialism and communism.
    In short, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the only way to transform the small-scale peasant economy, and it is also the central work of our party in the countryside in the future. Our party must strengthen the leadership of this work.

    III. Two-Line Struggle Must Be Carried Out in the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, our country's rural mutual aid and cooperation movement has made great achievements. Many mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have created high production records, undoubtedly showing its superiority. For example, according to the statistics of forty agricultural production cooperatives in North China and Northeast China in 1951, the unit area yield averaged 16.4 percent higher than the local mutual aid teams and 39.2 percent higher than the local individual farmers, some of which exceeded the individual farmers by more than one time. For example, the increase in production in Shuangfeng Village (a typical village of high yield) in Shanxi Province in 1952 compared to 1951: the 21 farmers who participated in the agricultural production cooperative increased production by 60 percent compared to 1951; the 22 households in the mutual aid joint team increased production by 31 percent; the five groups in the mutual aid team increased production by 23 percent; and the six individual households only increased production by 0.26 percent. For example, the agricultural production cooperative in Gaokan Village on the outskirts of Shenyang has doubled its grain output in the past three years. In the past, the average yield of sorghum per hectare was 5,000 catties, but this year's yield reached 10,000 catties. In short, long-term experience has proved that as long as the leadership of agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives is correct, the masses truly participate voluntarily, and there is reasonable management, its output and income are higher than those of individual farmers; and agricultural production cooperatives are higher than mutual aid teams. In production, the so-called "individual farming is not as good as mutual aid, and mutual aid is not as good as cooperation" has become a mass conclusion. Therefore, agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have been welcomed by the vast number of farmers and have gradually expanded. The number of organized farmers has been increasing year by year. In 1950, the number of organized farmers in the country accounted for 10 percent of the total number of farmers in the country; by 1951, it increased to 20 percent; by 1952, it reached about 25 percent in the newly liberated areas and more than 65 percent in the old liberated areas. By 1952, there were more than 8.3 million various mutual aid teams, 3,663 agricultural production cooperatives, and 2,219 state-owned farms (including 52 mechanized farms) in the country. Especially in the past year, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has not only increased in quantity, but also improved in quality. The awareness of many farmers has been improved, and it has played a role in promoting many tasks in the countryside. That is to say, today in our country, the organized farmers are already a vast and powerful labor army. Therefore, anyone who studies the problems of rural China and cannot see this great force and does not place hope on it must make extremely serious mistakes.
    Although our mutual aid and cooperation movement has made great achievements and accumulated many successful experiences, it cannot be denied that erroneous tendencies have also occurred in our work. For example, in some places in the old liberated areas not long after the end of the land reform, in order to stabilize the wavering production mood of the middle peasants at that time, they one-sidedly encouraged the enthusiasm of the individual economy, allowed the spontaneous capitalist trend in the small-scale peasant economy to flood, and despised or relaxed the task of guiding farmers to organize, thus producing a tendency of laissez-faire for a time. For example, last winter and this spring, in many areas, a subjective and unrealistic rash and adventurous tendency occurred in the development and improvement of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its resolution on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production: "One tendency is to take a negative attitude towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement, failing to see that this is the necessary road for our party to guide the vast number of farmers from the small-scale production of the individual economy to the large-scale collective economy of using machines for farming and harvesting, denying that the various agricultural production cooperatives that have already appeared are transitional forms towards agricultural socialization, and denying that they have socialist factors. This is a right-leaning erroneous thought. Another tendency is to take a rash attitude, disregarding the various necessary conditions of farmers' voluntariness and economic preparation, attempting prematurely and inappropriately to deny or restrict the private property of farmers participating in cooperatives, or attempting to implement absolute egalitarianism for members of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, or attempting to quickly establish higher-level socialist collective farms, believing that it is now possible to completely achieve socialism in the countryside in one fell swoop. These are 'left'-leaning erroneous thoughts." The Party Central Committee timely criticized these two erroneous ideological tendencies.
    In the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production, the two aspects of the nature of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, namely, the private nature and the cooperative nature, were correctly estimated. The members of the primary mutual aid teams have completely private means of production, but they also have the nature of joint labor, which is the bud of socialism. Year-round mutual aid teams further develop this bud. Agricultural production cooperatives, in terms of being based on private property, farmers have private ownership of land and other means of production, farmers get a certain amount of harvest according to the land shares, and get reasonable compensation for the tools and livestock shares, it preserves the private nature. In terms of farmers using land shares to unify the use of land, reasonably use tools, jointly labor, implement work points for remuneration, share dividends according to labor, and have certain public property, it has more socialist factors than year-round mutual aid teams. According to these two aspects of nature, it shows that the current agricultural production cooperatives are only a transitional form to socialist agriculture compared to fully socialist collective farms (that is, higher-level agricultural production cooperatives). The correctness of the party's policy lies in properly estimating the two aspects of the nature of the three forms of mutual aid and cooperation, so as to guide them forward prudently and actively on the basis of gradual development. Neglecting any aspect of the above two aspects of nature will inevitably lead to errors. For example, neglecting the cooperative nature will inevitably manifest itself as tailism lagging behind life, implementing a laissez-faire leadership method, which will inevitably lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement into decline and disintegration, or make the internal growth of capitalist tendencies in mutual aid teams and cooperatives. For example, neglecting its private nature will inevitably manifest itself as adventurism that transcends the possibilities of living conditions, resulting in coercive leadership methods, attempting to "pull up seedlings to help them grow," such as "forced grouping," "comprehensive grouping," etc., which will inevitably violate the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and easily harm the policy of uniting middle peasants, making the movement unable to be consolidated, and after encountering difficulties, it is easy to go into another extreme of laissez-faire. Past experience has proved that these two erroneous ideological tendencies and leadership methods are hindering the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, we must carry out two-line struggle in the movement, that is, both oppose the right-wing spontaneous trend and oppose the "left"-wing rash trend, resolutely implement the central policy of active leadership and steady development, and grasp the correct leadership methods, so that the cooperation and mutual aid movement can achieve healthy development. Stalin said in his article "Dizzy with Success": "The art of leadership is a serious matter. You must not fall behind the movement, because falling behind means being detached from the masses. However, you must not run too far ahead, because running too far ahead means losing the masses and falling into isolation. Anyone who wants to lead the movement and at the same time wants to maintain his ties with millions of masses should carry out struggle on two fronts: both against those who fall behind and against those who run too far ahead."

    IV. Further Strengthen Socialist Education for Farmers
    In the transition period, in order to attract farmers to participate in socialist construction, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthen the Party's educational work for farmers to transform farmers' thinking is a very important task. In the past few years, our Party has attached great importance to this work. Especially during the rural Party rectification, the education on the direction of rural economic development and the socialist prospect for rural Party members has played a significant role in improving the ideological awareness of rural Party members and the vast number of farmers. Now, our country has entered a period of large-scale construction, and the great first five-year plan has begun. In order to realize national industrialization and implement socialist transformation of agriculture, it is necessary to further strengthen socialist education for farmers. That is to say, in rural areas, we must vigorously publicize our Party's general line and general task during the transition period, publicize the policy of national industrialization and the state's socialist transformation of agriculture to cadres at all levels, all Party members, and all farmers, so that all farmers understand the two new and old roads of rural economic development, understand the prospects of our country and their own future, and understand the consistency of national interests and personal interests. In this way, we can mobilize the vast number of farmers to actively support the construction cause of the motherland and resolutely take the socialist road. If we can explain the benefits of national industrialization, especially the benefits of industrialization to farmers, we can stimulate farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and actively support national construction, enthusiastically sell grain to the state at reasonable prices. If we can explain the benefits of agricultural cooperation, the happy life of Soviet farmers, to the farmers, we can encourage the farmers' enthusiasm to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and are willing to take the socialist road with the working class.
    Of course, it is a difficult task to carry out socialist education for farmers and to fight against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small farmers. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") Because farmers are small private owners, they have a direct concern for private property. At the same time, due to the decentralization and backwardness of farmers in production, the conservative psychology and traditional habits spontaneously tend to the old road of capitalism, and they are not familiar with the new socialist road. Therefore, this change of mentality is not easy. But on the other hand, farmers are also laborers, they are concerned about how to get rid of the exploitation of landlords and rich peasants, and are concerned about how to get rid of poverty and ignorance, which makes them able to approach the working class and accept socialism, and can become the ally of the working class in socialist construction. Especially in the long-term revolutionary struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese farmers have made great contributions to the revolution on the one hand, and have also obtained great benefits and their lives have been greatly improved on the other hand. Therefore, they support the Communist Party and the People's Government with joy and encouragement. As long as we further strengthen education for farmers and do a good job in other rural work, they will follow the road indicated by the Communist Party, and they will definitely implement socialist transformation of themselves under the leadership of the working class. Otherwise, if we neglect or weaken political work in the countryside, some farmers will forget all the benefits that the Communist Party has led them to obtain land and improve their lives, and they will not see the better future of the country and themselves, but will spontaneously go to the old road.
    In the past, we had shortcomings and mistakes in educating farmers. For example, some places once did not dare to publicize socialism for a period, fearing that it would increase farmers' ideological concerns and affect their production mood. This was obviously giving up the Party's ideological leadership in the countryside, resulting in many farmers not knowing what the future of the country and themselves was, and a few farmers only caring about their own "sharp" wealth, and even some Party members hiring workers, lending usury, and not participating in mutual aid teams, blindly developing towards capitalism. For example, some places were very perfunctory in publicizing socialism, vulgarizing socialism, only talking about enjoyment and not talking about production, only talking about the future and not talking about the present, and some even explained it indiscriminately, saying that socialism is "returning to the big pile" and "eating from the big pot," etc., which caused ideological confusion among farmers and seriously hurt farmers' enthusiasm for production. Now we must greatly publicize socialism to farmers, we must summarize and absorb past experience, avoid repeating past shortcomings and mistakes, and achieve correct publicity, and must not distort it casually. Therefore, this requires cadres and Party members engaged in rural work at all levels to first study the Party's general line in the transition period well. Only when they truly understand it can they carry out correct publicity and lead all patriotic farmers forward.
    At the same time, we should point out that socialist education for farmers is a long-term and arduous task, and it cannot be rushed or forced. Lenin once said that it would take ten to twenty years to educate farmers to change their thinking and habits in the best case. If someone thinks that as long as they hold a few meetings with farmers, give a few reports, and organize a few discussions, it will be fine. That is a naive idea. Because farmers often believe in something based on their own experience and the proof of facts. Therefore, Lenin and Stalin taught us that we must follow the principle of voluntariness, use persuasion and education, and use the methods of commendation and proof, rather than using crude methods of coercion, to guide farmers to take the road of cooperation and collectivization. Therefore, when we publicize socialism to farmers, we must use the method of patient persuasion and the method of typical demonstration to enlighten their consciousness, so that they can recognize the correctness of the Party's calls and policies based on their own self-interest and practical experience, and then act positively in accordance with these calls and policies. For example, when we publicize the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation, we must run the mutual aid team and agricultural production cooperative well, and truly produce more grain than individual households, and indeed increase the income of members and society, so that it can be believed and welcomed by the masses, so that we can give farmers the most powerful collectivist education, so that we can mobilize farmers to take the road of organizing mutual aid and cooperation.

    逐步实现国家对农业的社会主义改造
    沙  英
    一、为什么国家要对农业实行社会主义改造
    党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，在农村方面就是逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。那末，为什么对农业要实行社会主义改造呢？目前我国农业的基本情况，仍是小农经济占优势，即实行手工劳动的农民，像一片散沙似的，一家一户就是一个生产单位，使用畜力和古老的旧式农具，在小块土地上进行着个体生产。这种落后的散漫的小农经济的特点，就是它的不稳定性和不能充分利用技术、机器、拖拉机和农业科学的成就。斯大林同志于一九二八年七月十三日在列宁格勒党部积极分子会议上的报告中这样说过：“小农经济究竟是什么？它只有很少的商品经济，很小的收入，而有比较多的自然经济，只有百分之十二或十三作为商品。”可是我们要实现国家工业化，随着国家工业的日益发展，城市人口大量增加，对于商品粮食和工业原料的需要也就不断迅速增长，然而小农经济是不能适应这种需要的。同时工业的发展要求国内有广大的市场，但是小农经济的农民是很不富足的，他们的购买力是很低的，从这方面看小农经济亦是不能适应工业发展的需要。对此，斯大林在“论国家工业化与联共（布）党内的右倾”中曾指出：“如果工业是主脑，那末农业便是工业发展底基础，因为农业是销售工业品的市场，是原料与粮食底供给者，是出口货底来源，我们必须有出口货，才能输入机械以供国民经济的需要。如果我们让农业仍停留在技术完全落后的状态中，不以农业基础保障工业，不改造农业，并且也不使它去接近工业，那末能不能推动工业前进呢？决不能。”
    按照马克思主义的再生产理论，现代社会没有逐年增加的积累，便不能发展，而逐年增加的积累，又非有逐年的扩大再生产不可。我们国家的工业，是按照马克思主义的扩大再生产论发展着，因而它的容量逐年增加，它有自己的积累，它十分迅速地前进。可是，在我国国民经济中占有较大比重的小农经济，并不是按照扩大再生产的原则发展的，它的大部分是不能逐年实现扩大再生产的。可是国民经济各个部门都要有一定的比例关系，工业与农业之间要有正确的对比关系，如果我们以小农经济为基础，难道可以加速推进我们国家的工业化吗？那是决不能够的。
    列宁、斯大林教导我们说：社会主义经济建设的问题，乃是整个国民经济的组织问题，既包括城市也包括农村，既包括工业也包括农业。这两种经济的亲密结合，乃是社会主义经济的基础。如果没有这种结合，社会主义便不可能实现。这不仅是因为农业给工业的发展提供了粮食、原料和市场，工业给农民提供了工业品和改造农业的机器，所以需要工业和农业的结合。而且作为经济制度的社会主义，不能建立在两个直接对立和互相排斥的基础上：即一方面是城市中的集中的社会主义大工业，而另一方面是农村中的散漫的落后的小农经济。如果这样，城市与乡村、工业与农业的关系就有破裂的危险，整个国民经济将来就有瓦解的一日。斯大林同志一九二五年在斯维尔德洛夫大学的演讲中如此指出：“社会主义的社会，是一个由工业及农村经济的工作人员结成的生产消费组合。如果工业的组合，与供给原料、粮食及消纳工业品的农村经济不发生密切的联系，如果工业与农村经济不能成为一个统一的整个的国民经济，那就没有什么社会主义了。因此，工业与农村经济的相互关系问题及无产阶级与农民的相互关系问题，就成为一个建设社会主义经济之根本问题。”毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中亦如此指出：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”
    因此，为了适应国家工业的发展，就要把小农经济变为巨大的农业，使它成为能够实行积累，能够实现扩大再生产的农业。可是，要把站在“十字路口”的小农经济变为巨大的农业，有两条道路可走：一条是资本主义的道路，一条是社会主义的道路。前一条道路是在农村培植资本主义，引起农民深刻的两极分化，除了少数的投机者和剥削者变为资产阶级以外，而绝大多数的农民将会陷于被剥削被奴役的贫困地位。后一条道路是在农村中培植集体农庄和国营农庄，结果，使小农户联合成为用新技术和科学武装起来的巨大集体农庄，使广大农民过着日益富足和文明的生活。我们怎么办呢？我们既不能让我们的农村经济长期停滞在小农经济上面，也不能让小农经济自发地走资本主义的道路，我们应当对小农经济实行社会主义改造，让他们走社会主义的道路。这是使农民摆脱贫穷大家富裕的唯一道路。只有走这条道路，才能把工农联盟安放在更巩固的经济基础之上。
    同时应当特别指出，像我们这样小农经济占很大优势、农业人口众多的大国，而且国家工业的发展又将十分迅速，小农经济的发展则十分缓慢，所以对农业进行社会主义的改造，就具有更严重的意义，而且是一种极艰巨的任务。
    二、发展互助合作运动是改造农业的唯一道路
    既然进行社会主义改造是必需的，那末应当怎样进行呢？马克思列宁主义教导我们说，对劳动农民是不能剥夺的，只有让他们一步一步地联合起来，走合作化、集体化的道路。斯大林在“联共
  （布）党史简明教程”中指出：“列宁认为一般合作制，特别是农业合作制，是千百万农民易于接受和了解的从狭小个体农庄过渡到大规模共耕制生产联合，即过渡到集体农庄的道路。”这个指示对我们也是完全适用的。远在十年之前，毛泽东同志在
  “组织起来”的著名演讲中就已指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”同时毛泽东同志和党中央还更具体地指示我们，我国农业的社会主义改造，必须按照农民自愿的原则经过发展互助合作的道路，把现在的农民个人土地私有制，逐步地代之以土地集体所有制，即实现农业集体化或社会主义化。这就是逐步改变生产关系，逐步改变所有制。只有实行这种改造，才能在将来实行农业机械化，才能大规模地发展农业生产力，提高农业的产量，并根据“按劳分配”的原则进行分配，以适应国家工业发展的需要和进一步改善农民的生活。农村是一个广大的阵地，社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领。这就是说，如果对农村不进行社会主义的改造，不时刻增加社会主义，听任资本主义的发展，那是非常危险的，那是不可能建成社会主义的。因此，提出“确保”农民生产资料私有制的口号是错误的。中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中说道：“党中央从来认为要克服很多农民在分散经营中所发生的困难，要使广大贫困的农民能够迅速地增加生产而走上丰衣足食的道路，要使国家得到比现在多得多的商品粮食及其他工业原料，同时也就提高农民的购买力，使国家的工业品得到广大的销场，就必须提倡‘组织起来’，按照自愿和互利的原则，发展农民互助合作的积极性。这种互助合作在现在是建立在个体经济基础上（农民私有财产的基础上）的集体劳动，其发展前途就是农业集体化或社会主义化。”
    对农民实行社会主义改造，需要在一个相当长的时期内逐步改造。因为我国是小农经济占极大优势的国家，农业人口有四万万七千万以上。要在这样一个农业人口众多的大国完成小农经济的社会主义改造，而且我国工业在短时期内还不能生产大批拖拉机和农业机器，而且农民的觉悟程度也还需要进行长期的教育才能逐步提高，当然不是轻而易举的事情，不可能一蹴而就。因此，唯一正确的道路，就是从小农经济这一基本情况出发，根据客观条件与主观力量，积极领导，稳步发展互助合作运动，逐步地过渡到完全社会主义的大规模生产的机械化的集体农庄。这种“逐步改造”的方针是绝不能动摇的。否则，如果不是逐步地改造，便是急躁冒进；如果不积极进行改造，便是放任自流。
    现在各地农民在农业生产上的互助合作运动的发展，随着各地农村经济的发展与生产的要求，而有各种不同的历史和复杂的形式，但大体上有三种主要的形式。第一种是简单的劳动互助，这是最初级的，主要是临时的季节性的，一般地都是小型的。第二种是常年的互助组，这是比第一种形式较高的形式。在这种形式中，有一部分实行农业和副业的互助相结合；有某些简单的生产计划，随后逐步地把劳动互助和提高技术相结合；有某些技术的分工；有的互助组并逐步地设置了一部分公有农具和牲畜，积累了小量的公有财产。第三种是农业生产合作社，或称为土地合作社。这种形式通常是在较好的互助合作运动基础上发展起来的，是农业生产互助合作运动在现在的高级形式。这种形式除了包括和发挥了互助组共同劳动的积极性这一特点以外，而且加进了土地入股这一个重要的特点，从而能合理地统一使用生产资料（土地、牲畜、农具等），又能够合理地统一使用劳动力，因此而形成比较多样的分工，并能集合较多的资金投入于技术改革和农业的基本建设，这就使它的生产力大大超过了互助组所能达到的水准，从而能够进一步地向着富裕的生活方面发展。不过这还是在土地私有基础上的农业生产合作社。用土地入股同样是根据自愿和互利的原则，并可以根据自愿的原则退股。
    我们互助合作运动应当采取的步骤，一般地说，是由小到大，由低级到高级，完全根据农民的自愿。这就是说先组织带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组；进一步组织和引导农民加入半社会主义的农业生产合作社和供销合作社；将来就可以再进一步建设完全社会主义性质的生产合作社（就是集体农场）和供销合作社，实现集体的生产和富裕的生活。这就是说，循序前进，逐步过渡，而且又要一贯到底。当然，在各地具体实施时，并不一定都是截然划分的，也并不一定都是整齐划一地循序而进的。互助合作运动是在具体的曲折道路上前进的，决不能企图用一种抽象的公式去机械地硬套。同时在发展互助合作运动时，我们也要打破一种认为新解放区一定发展得慢的观念，其实在具有许多有利条件的新解放区，如自然条件好，人口比较集中，群众文化水平较高，特别是地方干部强，能正确地掌握政策等等，某些新解放区是可能超过某些老解放区的。
    在目前条件下，领导互助合作运动，除了努力发展、巩固和提高互助组以外，还要大力加强对农业生产合作社的领导。农业生产合作社正在和将要成为改造农业的主要形式。因为它“方向好，增产高，收入多”，对农民起着一种旗帜的作用，办好农业生产合作社，即可带动互助组的大发展，所以必须有领导地有计划地加以发展，而且只许办好，不许办坏。如果办坏了，既浪费农民的精力，少打粮食，而且政治影响很坏，对国家对农民都是不利的。发展农业生产合作社，应当做到数量多，质量高和不出废品，那才是健康地发展。
    此外，我们还要有计划地举办若干机耕和半机耕的国营农场和一些农业试验场性质的国营农场，一方面用改进农业技术和使用新式农具这种现代化农场的优越性的范例，教育全体农民；另方面，按照可能的条件，给农业互助组和农业生产合作社以技术上的援助和指导。同时，在农民完全同意和有适当经济条件的地方，亦可试办少数社会主义性质的集体农庄，以便取得经验，并为农民示范。至于单干的农民，我们也要以满腔的热情去照顾和帮助他们，耐心地教育他们，绝不能对他们加以歧视和讥笑，绝不能粗暴地挫伤他们个体经济的积极性。这样就有可能使他们在将来逐步地加入互助合作组织。也就有可能实现我们在农村中的最后目的——引导全体农民走向社会主义和共产主义。
    总之，互助合作运动是改造小农经济的唯一道路，也是今后我们党在农村中的中心工作，我们党一定要加强对这一工作的领导。
    三、在互助合作运动中必须进行两条战线的斗争
    几年来，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，我国的农村互助合作运动有很大的成绩。有许多互助组和农业生产合作社曾创造了高额的生产纪录，无可怀疑地显示了它的优越性。例如根据华北和东北四十个农业生产合作社一九五一年的统计，单位面积产量平均超过当地互助组百分之十六点四，超过当地单干户农民百分之三十九点二，其中有的超过单干农民一倍以上。再如山西省双峰村（丰产典型村）一九五二年比一九五一年的增产统计：参加农业生产合作社的二十一户农民，比一九五一年增产百分之六十；互助联队二十二户，增产百分之三十一；互助组五个组，增产百分之二十三；单干户六户，只增产百分之零点二六。再如沈阳市郊高坎村的农业生产合作社，三年来粮食产量增加一倍，从前平均一垧地产五千斤高粱，而今年的产量达一万斤。总之，长时期的经验证明，农业互助组和农业生产合作社，只要领导正确，是群众真正自愿参加的，并有合理的经营，其产量与收入都比单干农民为高；而农业生产合作社又比互助组为高。在生产上所谓“单干不如互助，互助不如合作”，已成为群众性的结论。因此，农业互助组和农业生产合作社受到了广大农民群众的欢迎，从而逐渐扩展起来，组织起来的农户年年都在增加。在一九五○年，全国组织起来的农户占全国农民总户数百分之十；到一九五一年即增至百分之二十；到一九五二年，在新解放区达百分之二十五左右，在老解放区达百分之六十五以上。到一九五二年，全国已有各种互助组八百三十余万个，农业生产合作社三千六百六十三个，国营农场二千二百十九个（其中机械化农场五十二个）。特别是最近一年来，互助合作运动的发展，不仅是数量有了增加，而且质量有了提高，许多农民群众的觉悟提高了，并对农村中的许多工作起了推动作用。这就是说，今天在我国农村中，组织起来的农民，已经是一支广大而雄强的劳动大军了。因此，凡是研究中国农村问题的人，要是看不见这种伟大的力量，不把希望寄托于此，那一定要犯极为严重的错误。
    虽然我们互助合作运动有很大的成绩，也积累了许多成功的经验，但是也不能否认，在我们的工作当中也曾发生过错误的倾向。例如在土地改革结束后不久老解放区的某些地方，为了稳定当时中农的动荡的生产情绪，曾片面地鼓励个体经济的积极性，对小农经济中自发的资本主义趋势任其泛滥发展，轻视或放松了引导农民组织起来的任务，因而
  一度产生了自流主义倾向。又如去年冬天和今年春天，不少地区在发展和提高互助合作组织方面，发生了一种主观主义的、不切合实际的急躁冒进倾向。中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中曾如此指出：“一种倾向是采取消极的态度对待互助合作运动，看不出这是我党引导广大农民群众从小生产的个体经济逐渐走向大规模的使用机器耕种和收割的集体经济所必经的道路，否认现在业已出现的各种农业生产合作社是走向农业社会主义化的过渡的形式，否认它们带有社会主义的因素。这是右倾的错误的思想。另一种倾向是采取急躁的态度，不顾农民自愿和经济准备的各种必须的条件，过早地、不适宜地企图在现在就否定或限制参加合作社的农民的私有财产，或者企图对于互助组和农业生产合作社的成员实行绝对平均主义，或者企图很快地举办更高级的社会主义化的集体农庄，认为现在可以一蹴而在农村中完全达到社会主义。这些是‘左’倾的错误的思想。”党中央及时对这两种错误的思想倾向作了批判。
    在中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中，正确地估计了互助组和农业生产合作社的两方面的性质，即私有的性质和合作的性质。初级互助组的组员，他们的生产资料是完全私有的，但也带有共同劳动的性质，这是社会主义的萌芽。常年互助组则使这种萌芽进一步生长起来了。农业生产合作社，就其建立在私有财产的基础上，农民有土地私有权和其他生产资料的私有权，农民得按入股的土地分配一定的收获量，并得按入股的工具及牲畜取得合理的代价这些条件来说，它保存着私有的性质。就农民以土地入股得以统一使用土地，合理使用工具，共同劳动，实行计工取酬，按劳分红，并有某些公共的财产这些条件来说，它就比常年互助组具有更多的社会主义因素。根据这两方面的性质，说明了现在的农业生产合作社比起完全的社会主义的集体农庄（即更高级的农业生产合作社），它还只是向社会主义农业的过渡形式。党的政策的正确性，就在于恰当地估计三种互助合作形式的两方面的性质，从而谨慎地又是积极地在逐步发展的基础上，引导它们前进。忽视了上述两方面性质的任何一面，都不免要发生错误。例如忽视了它的合作的性质这一方面，就必然表现为落在生活后面的尾巴主义，实行放任自流的领导方法，这势必使互助合作运动陷于消沉和瓦解，或使互助组和合作社内部滋长资本主义的倾向。又例如忽视它的私有性质，就必然表现为超越生活条件可能性的冒险主义，产生强迫命令的领导方法，企图“拔苗助长”，例如，“强迫编组”、“全面编组”等等，这势必违反自愿和互利的原则，而且容易伤害联合中农的政策，使运动不能巩固，而在碰到困难之后，又容易走入放任自流的另一个极端。过去的经验证明，这两种错误的思想倾向和领导方法，都是阻碍着互助合作运动的健康发展的。因此，我们必须在运动中进行两条战线的斗争，即既反对右的自流倾向，也反对“左”的冒进倾向，坚决贯彻中央积极领导、稳步发展的方针，并掌握正确的领导方法，这样才能使合作互助运动获得健康发展。斯大林在“胜利冲昏头脑”一文中说道：“领导的艺术是一件严重事情。不可落在运动后面，因为落在后面，就是脱离群众。可是，也不可跑得太前，因为跑得太前，就是丧失群众而自陷于孤立地位。谁愿意领导运动，同时又愿意保持自己与千百万群众的联系，那他就应进行两条战线上的斗争：既反对落在后面的分子，又反对跑得太前的分子。”
    四、对农民进一步加强社会主义的教育
    在过渡时期中，为了吸引农民参加社会主义的建设，巩固工农联盟，加强党对农民的教育工作，以改造农民的思想，乃是一项很重要的任务。几年来，我们党都很重视这项工作。特别是在农村整党期间对农村党员进行了农村经济发展方向和社会主义远景教育，对提高农村党员和广大农民的思想觉悟，是起了重大的作用。现在，我们国家进入了大规模的建设时期，伟大的第一个五年计划已经开始了，为了实现国家工业化和对农业实行社会主义的改造，需要进一步加强对农民进行社会主义的教育。这就是说，我们在农村中要向各级干部、全体党员和所有的农民大力宣传我党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，宣传国家工业化和国家对农业实行社会主义改造的方针，使所有的农民都懂得农村经济发展的新旧两条道路，都懂得我们国家的远景和自己的前途；都懂得国家的利益和个人利益的一致性。这样才能动员广大农民群众积极支援祖国的建设事业，坚决走社会主义的道路。如果我们能把国家工业化的好处，特别是工业化对农民的利益讲清楚，就能激发农民的爱国主义热情，积极支援国家的建设，踊跃地把粮食按照合理价格卖给国家。如果我们能把农业合作化的好处，把苏联农民的幸福生活，给农民讲清楚，就能鼓舞农民参加互助合作运动的热情，愿意和工人阶级一起走社会主义的道路。
    当然，对农民进行社会主义的教育，和小农的自发的资本主义倾向作斗争，是一件困难的事情。毛泽东同志说过：“严重的问题是教育农民。”（“论人民民主专政”）因为农民是小私有者，对私有财产有直接的关心，同时由于农民在生产上的分散性和落后性所产生的保守心理与传统习惯，自发地趋向于资本主义的旧道路，他们对新的社会主义道路是不熟悉的。因此，这种心理的改变不是很容易的。但是另一方面，农民又是劳动者，他们关心如何摆脱地主和富农的剥削，关心如何摆脱贫困和愚昧的境地，这就使他们能够接近工人阶级和接受社会主义，能够成为工人阶级在社会主义建设中的同盟者。特别是在长期的革命斗争中，我国农民在共产党的领导下，一方面对革命有了很大的功劳，一方面也得到了巨大的利益，生活有了很大的改善，因此，他们对共产党和人民政府是欢欣鼓舞地拥护，只要我们进一步加强对农民的教育，并做好其他各种农村工作，他们是会按照共产党所指示的道路前进的，也定能在工人阶级领导下对他们自己实行社会主义改造。否则，如果我们忽视了或减弱了农村的政治工作，有些农民便会忘记了共产党领导他们得到土地和改善了生活的一切好处，看不清国家和自己更美好的前途，而自发地走向旧的道路。
    过去我们在对农民进行教育工作这方面是有缺点和错误的。例如有的地方曾有一个时期不敢宣传社会主义，怕增加农民的思想顾虑，怕影响生产情绪。这显然是放弃了党在农村中的思想领导，结果致使许多农民都不知道国家和自己的前途是什么，少数农民只顾自己“冒尖”发财，甚至有些党员也雇工、放高利贷和不参加互助组，盲目地向资本主义发展。再例如有的地方在宣传社会主义时很不认真，把社会主义庸俗化，只讲享受不讲生产，只讲将来不讲现在，有的甚至胡乱地讲解，说社会主义就是“归大堆”、“吃大锅饭”等等，这就造成农民的思想混乱，严重地打击了农民的生产积极性。现在我们对农民要大大宣传社会主义，一定要总结和吸取过去的经验，避免重复过去的缺点和错误，做到正确地宣传，不能随便歪曲。为此，这就要求我们从事农村工作的各级干部和党员，首先要对党在过渡时期的总路线好好地进行学习，只有自己真正弄通了，然后才能进行正确的宣传，带领全体爱国的农民前进。
    同时我们应当指出，对农民进行社会主义的教育，乃是一种长期的艰苦的工作，性急不得，强迫不得。列宁曾说过，要教育农民改变其思想和习惯，在最好的情况下也要一二十年的时间。如果有人认为：只要对农民开几个会，作几个报告，再组织几次讨论就行了。那是一种天真的想法。因为农民往往是根据自己的经验和事实证明来相信一件事情的。所以列宁、斯大林教导我们说，必须按照自愿原则，用说服教育、用表彰和证明的方法，而不是用粗暴的强迫命令的方法，来引导农民走合作化和集体化的道路。因此，我们在对农民宣传社会主义的时候，一定要用耐心说服的方法，用典型示范的方法，来启发他们的自觉性，使他们根据自己的切身利益和实际体验去认识党的号召和政策的正确性，从而按照这些号召和政策积极行动起来。例如当我们宣传互助合作的优越性时，我们一定要把互助组和农业生产合作社办好，真正比单干户多打粮食，确实增加了组员和社会的收入，这才能为群众所相信所欢迎，这才能给予农民以最有力的集体主义教育，这才能动员农民走组织起来互助合作的道路。
