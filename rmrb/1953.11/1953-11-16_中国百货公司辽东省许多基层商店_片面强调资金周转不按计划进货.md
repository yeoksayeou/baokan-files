Many grassroots stores of China National Department Store Liaoning Province
	Unilaterally emphasize capital turnover and fail to purchase goods according to plan
	In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Andong, Xiuyan, Kuandian, Fengcheng counties and Andong city department stores under the China National Department Store Liaoning Provincial Company, due to the lack of study by leading cadres of the spirit of the instructions on increasing production and practicing economy from the Central Ministry of Commerce and the inability to correctly implement them, did not start from expanding commodity circulation, expanding business varieties, and actively promoting sales, but unilaterally emphasized accelerating capital turnover, resulting in the erroneous practice of compressing business varieties and failing to purchase goods according to plan. Therefore, the state-owned department store system in the province only completed 7.9% of the quarterly commodity sales plan in early October.
	This phenomenon of simply emphasizing accelerating capital turnover and compressing business varieties is very serious. The purchasing agent of the Andong County Department Store stationed at the Andong City Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station purchased 200 bolts of Qinghua gabardine in mid-October. This batch of goods was contracted by the store and the supply station. However, after transporting them back to the store, the leadership found that the Qinghua gabardine purchased on September 16 had not yet been sold out, so they insisted that the purchasing agent return the goods except for leaving 60 bolts. This caused waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources, and failed to meet the supply. More seriously, the store's leading cadres even wrote a letter criticizing the purchasing agent, saying: "Now is the time to increase production and practice economy, and goods cannot be purchased blindly. In the future, purchases must be made with the store's approval." Of course, it is right not to purchase goods blindly, but executing a contract should not be regarded as blind purchasing.
	The Xiuyan and Andong county department stores changed the quantity of Qing twill to be purchased at one time to two purchases. The Kuandian County Department Store stipulated to the purchasing agent: "No goods are allowed to be purchased without the store's purchase order." Therefore, the purchase orders written by the salespersons through the commercial communication network were not organized for purchase by the purchasing agent because they did not have the store's approval, which seriously affected the execution of the planned supply contract. A new batch of seasonal Qing khaki cloth arrived at the Andong Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station. According to the contract, the Kuandian and Xiuyan department stores were urged to purchase the goods, but the store's purchasing agents said: "No goods can be purchased without the store's purchase order." This caused the seasonal best-selling goods to be stocked in the warehouse, affecting sales. After launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the clothing and shoes department of the Andong City Department Store adopted the practice of not purchasing goods themselves, and leading customers to the wholesale station to buy goods when they came to buy them, in order to reduce the accumulation of funds. One day, a soldier wanted to buy five canvas boxes, and the department led the soldier to the purchasing and supply wholesale station to select five. The Fengcheng County Department Store signed a supply contract with the purchasing and supply wholesale station for 127 pieces of paper in October, but only 45 pieces were executed in the first half of the month. The No. 9 outlet of the Andong City Department Store signed a contract with the purchasing and supply wholesale station in October to supply 54 pieces of paper, but had not purchased a single piece by the middle of October.
	This deviation has begun to attract the attention of the leaders of the China National Department Store Liaoning Provincial Company. On October 16, six cadres were transferred to conduct a comprehensive inspection, starting from the Andong Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station and the Andong City Department Store. The inspection revealed that the situation was very serious. For example, the wholesale station had ten types of batteries in stock, but the wholesale department of the Andong City Department Store only handled two types, and seven of the eight types not handled were out of stock. There were fifteen types of various flannels in stock at the wholesale station, which are currently selling well, but the wholesale department of the Andong City Department Store did not purchase any of them. Other items such as towels and socks were also fewer in specifications and varieties than the wholesale station's inventory.

### 中国百货公司辽东省许多基层商店  片面强调资金周转不按计划进货

　　中国百货公司辽东省许多基层商店
    片面强调资金周转不按计划进货
    中国百货公司辽东省公司所属安东、岫岩、宽甸、凤城县及安东市百货商店，在开展增产节约运动中，由于领导干部对中央商业部关于增产节约指示的精神缺乏研究，不能正确贯彻，因而不从扩大商品流通、扩大经营品种、积极推销着手，而片面强调加速资金周转，产生了压缩经营品种，不按计划进货的错误作法。因此，全省国营百货系统十月上旬仅完成季度商品销售计划的百分之七点九。
    这种单纯强调加速资金周转压缩经营品种的现象是很严重的。安东县百货商店驻安东市采购供应批发站的采购员，在十月中旬进了二百匹青华达呢，这批商品是商店和供应站签订过合同的。但运回商店后，领导方面发现九月十六日进的青华达呢还没有卖完，因而除留下六十匹外，就一定要采购员退货。这样就造成人力、物力和资财的浪费，不能满足供应，更严重的是商店领导干部竟写信批评采购员说：“现在是增产节约，不能盲目进货，今后必须经商店同意再进。”当然不能盲目进货是对的，但不能把执行合同看成是盲目进货。
    岫岩、安东县百货商店将一次应进青斜纹布的数量改为两次进货。宽甸县百货商店给采购员规定：“没有商店要货单不准进货。”因此，营业员通过商业通讯网写来的要货单，因没有商店同意的字样，采购员不敢照数组织进货，严重地影响计划供应合同的执行。安东采购供应批发站新到了一批应季商品青卡叽布，按照合同规定，督促宽甸、岫岩百货商店进货，但商店采购员说：“没有商店的要货单不能进。”使适应季节的畅销货压在仓库里，影响了销售。安东市百货商店服装、鞋帽营业部在开展增产节约后，采取自己不进货，顾客来要货就领他到批发站去买的作法来减少资金的积压。一天有一军人要买五个帆布箱子，而该部即带领军人去采购供应批发站挑选了五个。凤城县百货商店十月份和采购供应批发站签订一百二十七件纸张的供应合同，在前半个月内才执行了四十五件。安东市百货商店第九门市部十月份和采购供应批发站签订供应五十四件纸张合同，到十月半还没有进过一件。
    这一偏差已开始引起了中国百货公司辽东省公司领导上的重视，已在十月十六日抽调六名干部，从安东采购供应批发站及安东市百货商店着手，进行了全面的检查。从检查中可以看出情况是十分严重的。如批发站库存十种电池，而安东市百货商店批发部只经营了两种，其未经营的八种中就有七种脱销。目前正适销的各种花呢，批发站库存有十五种，安东市百货商店批发部却一种也没进。其他如毛巾、袜子等，都少于批发站库存规格品种。
