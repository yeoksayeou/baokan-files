    Our reporter Zhu Bo took these photos:
    Overall view of the cutting machine in the tube billet workshop. The cutting blade of the cutting machine has a pressure of one thousand tons and can cut thick tube billets.
    The tube billet rack can accommodate a large number of tube billets transported from the steel mill, allowing them to be continuously put into the production process.
    Cooling table. After the steel pipes are cooled here, they only need to be finished and processed to become finished products.
    The huge tube rolling mill is running well and has now been handed over to the production department, ready for production.

    管坯工段的剪断机全貌。剪断机的切刀具有一千吨的压力，能够切断粗大的管坯。
    管坯架能够容纳大量从炼钢厂运来的管坯，使它不断投入到生产过程中去。
    冷却台。钢管在这里冷却后只要再经过精整和加工，就成为成品了。
    巨大的轧管机进行运转后效果良好，现在已经移交给生产部门，待进行生产。
