In the past four years, farmland water conservancy construction across the country has played a significant role in promoting the recovery and development of agricultural production. The Communist Party of China and the People's Government have taken many measures to actively lead farmers in various regions to extensively build diverse small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, generally improving the capacity for flood control, drought prevention, and drainage. This year, many southern provinces experienced severe drought in the summer, but thanks to the widespread increase and improvement of water conservancy facilities in recent years, and with the timely leadership of party committees and governments at all levels in leading the masses to persevere in the fight against drought, the disasters were mitigated, and agricultural production in these provinces maintained a certain degree of increase. However, it should be recognized that under the current technical conditions, the threat of floods and droughts to our country's agricultural production is still long-term. Only by carrying out water conservancy work for a long time based on national industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture can we gradually reduce and overcome these natural disasters.

Based on the experience of the past four years, farmland water conservancy work must be carried out during the winter, especially in the paddy field areas of southern provinces. For example, in Tuan Shan District, Xuan Cheng County, Anhui Province, ponds and reservoirs were generally built in the winter of 1952, increasing water storage. When they suffered severe drought in May and June of this year, irrigation was carried out in a timely manner, and a bumper harvest was obtained. However, some areas missed the favorable opportunity for winter repairs and rushed to work in the spring, which contradicted spring plowing and production. Some missed the water storage season, which affected rice transplanting, and it was difficult to exert the due drought resistance effect during the summer drought. In some areas, basically no water conservancy work was carried out last winter, and it was not until after the Spring Festival this year that they began to rush to repair. However, spring is the busy season for spring plowing, so the original water conservancy plan had to be delayed, reduced, or cancelled, which relatively weakened the ability to resist flood and drought disasters this year. This situation occurred mainly because agricultural water conservancy departments did not pay enough attention to the development of mass water conservancy undertakings, or because the local party and government leading organs did not arrange winter rural work reasonably and properly. Now the party committees and governments of Guangdong, Yunnan, Zhejiang and other provinces have arranged various preparations for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. Leading organs to all levels of cadres have taken action, going deep into districts and townships, seizing time, and starting early, which is very correct and timely. Places that have not yet started this work should refer to the practices of these regions and study and arrange this work as soon as possible, and should not delay.

This winter's farmland water conservancy work should be planned by the local party committees based on local conditions, in a unified manner in the winter activities in the countryside, and combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the countryside. Where conditions permit, technical and economic assistance should be provided as much as possible to the water conservancy needs of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Because the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the only way to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, greatly increase agricultural production and improve farmers' lives, the state should give possible and necessary support to agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and water conservancy work should become a powerful tool to help the consolidation and development of cooperatives and mutual aid teams. At the same time, the water conservancy requirements of farmers who have not yet been organized should also be properly taken care of, in order to benefit agricultural production increase, and through the collective construction of farmland water conservancy projects, to promote them to embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation.

According to past experience, because the natural conditions of farmland water conservancy in various places are different, the county must be the unit of specific guidance, adapting to local conditions, and formulating plans and organizing implementation through the masses. The Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government and the water conservancy departments of various provinces and special districts should conduct in-depth supervision and inspection to help working cadres and the masses of farmers solve specific difficulties in the construction of water conservancy projects. It is wrong to subjectively apportion tasks without considering the needs and possibilities of the masses; it is also wrong to take a laissez-faire attitude, not to actively and specifically lead the masses to overcome the threat of drought and flood disasters year by year, and affect grain production.

Among the farmland water conservancy projects built in the past, some have low quality, which affects the safety and benefits of the projects; many water conservancy projects rushed to repair during the drought resistance period this year were inevitably rough due to the urgent time. These must be improved. This winter should be used to check and repair them as much as possible. In the future, in small-scale farmland water conservancy work, we must also pay full attention to improving project quality and strengthening technical guidance. Water conservancy departments at all levels, especially provinces and special districts, must correct the erroneous view of neglecting small-scale water conservancy technology, proceed from the needs of the masses, transfer sufficient technical cadres, go deep into districts and townships, assist the masses in conducting surveys and plans, focus on mastering the construction of several projects, disseminate the current needed science and technology, and pay attention to summarizing experience and promoting it.

As for the northern provinces, freezing is about to begin. We should seize the time to carry out winter irrigation and conserve soil moisture in areas with customs and conditions, and make various preparations for the development of farmland water conservancy next year. Areas planning to open canals and dig wells next year should sum up their past work well, accept successful experiences and lessons learned, and use winter slack time to prepare for construction. Local water conservancy departments should coordinate with supply and marketing cooperatives and waterwheel production units to study and determine plans as early as possible, and produce waterwheels in a timely manner so as not to miss the supply next spring. In the past, some waterwheels had high costs, high prices, and poor quality, and were not welcomed by farmers. In the future, it is necessary to regularly check product specifications and quality during the production process, reduce production costs and selling prices, and supply farmers with efficient and inexpensive waterwheels.

Existing irrigation areas and state-owned farms with water conservancy facilities in various places must seize the winter to effectively rectify water conservancy projects, improve management, ensure that special personnel are responsible, formulate improvement plans for the actual problems existing in this irrigation area and farm, and carry out annual repairs in a timely manner to ensure smooth production next year.

In some irrigation areas, soil alkalization, decline in fertility, and reduced crop production have occurred due to long-term flooding irrigation. In these areas, irrigation area management agencies and higher-level agricultural water conservancy departments should organize certain cadres in winter to investigate alkalized cultivated land, find out the root causes of alkalization, propose improvement methods, and start implementing them next year to prevent and reduce the occurrence of alkaline land.

Doing a good job in winter water conservancy is an important key to further reducing the threat of drought and flood disasters next year. Now that winter has arrived and time is very tight, party and government leading organs at all levels must act quickly, lead the masses to do a good job in winter farmland water conservancy, and create more favorable conditions for increasing grain and cotton production next year.

### 抓紧时机作好冬季农田水利工作

    抓紧时机作好冬季农田水利工作
    四年以来，全国农田水利建设，在促进农业生产的恢复和发展方面，起了不小的作用。中国共产党和人民政府采取了许多措施，积极领导各地农民广泛地兴修了多种多样的小型农田水利，普遍地提高了防洪、防旱、排涝的能力。今年南方多数省份夏季发生严重旱象，但由于几年来水利设施的普遍增加与改善，各级党委和政府及时地领导群众坚持抗旱斗争，因而减轻了灾害，保持了农业生产在这些省份仍有一定程度的增加。但是，应该认识到，在目前的技术条件下，水旱灾害对我国农业生产的威胁还是长期性的，只有在国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造的基础上，长期地开展水利工作，才能逐步减轻和克服这些自然灾害。
    根据四年来的经验，农田水利工作，必须抓紧冬季进行，尤其南方各省稻田地区更是如此。如安徽省宣城县团山区，一九五二年冬季普遍兴修了塘坝水库，增加了蓄水量，在今年五、六两月份遭受严重干旱威胁时，及时地进行了灌溉，获得了丰收。但有些地区，错过了冬修有利时机，到春季突击赶工，与春耕生产发生矛盾，有的误了蓄水季节，影响了插秧，而在夏季干旱当中，也就难以发挥应有的抗旱效能。也有些地区，去年冬季基本上没有开展水利工作，直到今年春节以后才开始突击兴修，而春季正是春耕忙碌的季节，因此原定水利计划不得不延缓、缩减或取消，相对地削弱了今年抗御水旱灾害的能力。发生这种情形，主要是由于农业水利部门对于兴修群众性水利事业重视不够，或者是由于当地党政领导机关对冬季农村工作的安排未尽合理，未尽妥善。现在广东、云南、浙江等省党委和政府，已经布置了今冬明春兴修水利的各项准备工作，从领导机关到各级干部已经行动起来，深入区乡，争取时间，提早动手，这是十分正确和及时的。还没有着手这一工作的地方，应该参考这些地区的作法，及早研究布置这项工作，不可拖延。
    今冬农田水利工作，应由各地党委根据当地情况，在农村开展冬季各项工作中统筹布置，并与农村中的互助合作运动结合进行。在条件许可的情况下，对于农业生产合作社和互助组的水利需要，应尽可能地给予技术上和经济上的帮助。因为互助合作运动是对农业实行社会主义改造，大量提高农业生产和改善农民生活的必由之路，国家对于农业生产合作社和互助组应该给以可能的和必要的扶持，水利工作应该成为帮助合作社、互助组巩固发展的有力工具之一。同时，也要适当照顾尚未组织起来的农民对水利的要求，以利农业增产，并且经过集体兴修农田水利的工作，来促进他们走上互助合作的道路。
    根据过去经验，因为各地农田水利的自然条件不同，所以必须以县为具体指导的单位，因地制宜，并通过群众拟定计划，组织实现。中央人民政府水利部以及各省、各专区的水利部门，应深入督促检查，帮助工作干部和农民群众，解决兴修水利中的具体困难问题。不根据群众需要与可能，主观地摊派任务是错误的；采取放任自流态度，不积极地具体领导群众逐年克服旱涝灾害的威胁，影响粮食生产，也是不对的。
    过去兴修的农田水利工程当中，有的质量很低，影响了工程的安全和效益；今年抗旱期间，抢修的许多水利工程，因为时间紧迫，难免粗糙。这些都须加以改善。应利用今年冬季尽可能地加以检查，加以整修。今后在小型农田水利工作中，亦须充分注意提高工程质量，加强技术指导。各级水利部门，特别是省和专区，必须纠正轻视小型水利技术的错误观点，从群众的需要出发，抽调足够的技术干部，深入区乡，协助群众进行勘查计划，有重点地掌握几处工程的施工，传播当前需要的科学技术，并注意总结经验加以推广。
    至于北方各省，目前就要结冻，应抓紧时间在有习惯有条件的地区，进行冬灌保墒，并为明年发展农田水利作好各项准备工作。计划明年开渠打井的地区，应很好地总结一下过去的工作，接受成功的经验和失败的教训，利用冬闲进行施工准备。各地水利部门应协同供销合作社和水车生产单位，及早研究，确定计划，及时生产水车，不误明春供应。过去有些水车成本高、价格高、质量差，不受农民欢迎，今后必须在生产过程中，经常检查产品规格质量，降低生产成本和出售价格，供应农民以效率高、价钱便宜的水车。
    各地现有灌区，及有水利设施的国营农场，必须抓紧冬季，将水利工程切实加以整顿，改进管理，做到专人负责，并针对本灌区和农场存在的实际问题，制定改进方案，及时进行岁修，以保证明年顺利生产。
    有些灌区，由于长期大水漫灌，发生土壤碱化、地力衰退和农作物减产的现象。在这些地区，灌区管理机构和上级农业水利部门，应在冬季组织一定干部进行碱化耕地的调查，找出碱化的根源，提出改进办法，并在明年着手贯彻实施，以防止和减少碱地的发生。
    做好冬季的水利工作乃是进一步减轻明年旱涝灾害威胁的重要关键。现在冬季已经到来，时间已很紧迫，各级党政领导机关都要迅速行动起来，领导群众作好冬季农田水利工作，为明年粮食棉花增产创造更有利的条件。
