The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is striving to achieve its production increase and grain saving plan. The entire cooperative completed the sowing of the main crop of wheat in late September. By October 5th, the harvest of millet, beans, and sorghum was completed, and the focus shifted to harvesting corn. By October 13th, the autumn harvest was completed five days ahead of schedule. During the autumn harvest, the cooperative improved operational methods and achieved "three cleans," resulting in over a thousand jin less grain loss compared to previous years on the cooperative's two hundred and sixty-seven mu of autumn fields.

During this year's harvest, the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative first emphasized harvesting cleanly. Regardless of the labor group, everything was harvested and transported immediately. Zhang Huize, a 65-year-old farmer, said, "In previous years, we always waited for the millet to dry before moving it to the threshing ground, scattering grain everywhere. This year, we move it as soon as it's cut, which saves at least three or four jin of grain per mu." Some millet and corn fields also had beans interplanted. In the past, the beans were always harvested after the millet, resulting in significant seed loss due to sun exposure and cracking. This year, millet, beans, and sorghum were cleared together, improving the method and reducing bean loss. This year, every woman who went to the fields carried a small cloth bag to pick up any stray grains. Shen Jilan and seven other women collected three sheng of beans and five jin of millet ears in a single day. On October 3rd, the wind picked up on the mountaintop. The fifth mu of millet on the Xiaoduo Ao mountaintop, belonging to the first group, had not yet been harvested. Therefore, the cooperative changed the work plan for the day, and Shen Jilan led seven women to harvest the five mu of millet without resting at noon, avoiding losses. The millet fields of the fifth group had some areas that turned yellow at the ends first, and others that turned yellow in the middle first. They harvested by cutting the yellow areas first, preventing grain loss. Secondly, they demanded cleanliness on the roads. In the past, they waited for the crops to dry thoroughly in the fields before transporting them, scattering many seeds on the road with every bump. This year, they cut and transported them manually as soon as they were cut, resulting in very little seed scattering on the roads. Thirdly, they demanded clean stalks. In the past, when threshing millet by cutting the ears, many millet ears were lost in the stalks in order to save time. This year, they implemented the method of cutting the grain after waiting for the ears to mature and cutting the grain in the threshing ground, and paid attention to inspection during threshing, which reduced the loss of ears. On the first day of threshing, an inspection of the thirteen bundles of millet cut by cooperative member Zhang Yinhua revealed five missing ears. She was criticized at the time, which further motivated cooperative members to cut and thresh carefully. No one was found to have lost millet ears in subsequent inspections.

    李顺达农林牧畜生产合作社努力实现增产节约计划
    收打秋庄稼比往年少损失千余斤粮食
    山西平顺县西沟乡李顺达农林牧畜生产合作社，努力实现增产节约粮食的计划。九月下旬全社即已完成正茬麦的播种；十月五日，收打完谷子、豆子、高粱，转向收玉茭，到十月十三日，秋收比原计划提前五天完成。秋收中改进了操作方法，做到了“三净”，全社二百六十七亩秋田，收打中比往年少损失了一千多斤粮食。
    李顺达农林牧畜生产合作社，今年在收割中，首先提倡收得净。不管那个劳动小组，都是随割随运。六十五岁的农民张会则说：“往年割倒谷子，总是等干了才往场里搬，满地撒得是谷。今年割倒就搬，每一亩地，至少少丢三、四斤粮食。”有些谷地和玉茭地带种着豆子，往年总是割完谷再收豆，结果豆子经太阳一晒，崩裂掉籽很多，今年是谷、豆、高粱一齐清，改进了方法，少丢了豆子。今年每个妇女上地，都随身带着小布袋，见粮就拾，申纪兰等八个妇女，一天就拾回豆子三升，谷穗五斤。十月三日，山顶起了风，第一小组小堕凹山顶上的五亩谷还没有收完，于是社里便改变当天做活计划，由申纪兰领着七个妇女，中午不休息，把五亩谷子收回，避免了损失。第五组的谷子地有的先黄两头，有的先黄中间，他们便用黄那片割那片的办法收割，不让粮食丢失。其次是要求路上净。往年等庄稼在地里干透了才运送，路上碰一下就撒籽很多，今年随时割倒，随时用人工搬运，路上撒籽很少。第三是要求谷草净。往年打谷切穗，为了图快，谷草中丢失很多谷穗，今年实行了等穗割谷、场里切谷的办法，并在打场切谷时注意检查，就减少了丢穗。第一天打谷，检查社员张银花所切十三捆谷子，丢了五个穗，大伙当时进行了批评，这就更推动了社员细切细打，以后再检查不出谁丢谷穗了。　（杨树培　陈　杰　关振中）
