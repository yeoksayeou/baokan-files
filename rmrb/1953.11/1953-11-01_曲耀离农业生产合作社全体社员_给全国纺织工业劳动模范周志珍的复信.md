Dear Comrade Zhou Zhizhen:

We, all the members of the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative, felt honored when we read your letter to our cooperative chairman in the People's Daily on October 8th. Because Comrade Qu Yaoli went to Korea with the Third Delegation to Comfort the Korean People, our vice-chairman read your letter in detail at a general meeting of the members, and everyone discussed it.

Dear Comrade Zhou Zhizhen: Although we are thousands of miles apart and have never met, after reading your letter, we deeply feel that you are like our own sister. No, even closer than a sister. Your exemplary deeds have encouraged us. We must produce more and better cotton to meet the needs of the national textile industry and to satisfy the demands of the people nationwide for cloth.

Last winter, under the leadership of the People's Government, we transitioned from mutual aid teams to an agricultural production cooperative. At the beginning of this year, we formulated a plan to increase cotton production for the whole cooperative in 1953. To realize this plan, we have waged a tenacious struggle against drought, flood, pests, and frost for the past year, winning the possibility of large-scale high yields. A few days ago, our village appraisal and inspection team measured and estimated that this year our cooperative has 16.4 mu of high-yield cotton fields that can produce more than 700 jin of seed cotton per mu. In addition, 12 mu of irrigated cotton fields can produce more than 500 jin per mu, and 21 mu of dryland cotton fields can produce more than 200 jin per mu. Now, our cooperative has picked back more than 16,000 jin of seed cotton, and the whole cooperative is confident of completing a total output of 31,000 jin of seed cotton this year.

We also pay great attention to improving the quality of cotton. This year, we strengthened cotton field management, pruning, and pest control. In particular, timely watering in the later stages of cotton seedling growth resulted in longer fibers and better quality cotton. The cotton we recently sold to the state is more than 90% "1430" grade cotton, which is two grades higher than the cotton of ordinary local cotton farmers. We know that only by selling good cotton to the state can factories weave good cloth. Our slogan is: "Keep inferior cotton for ourselves, sell good cotton to the state." Therefore, before each sale of cotton, we conduct a final sun-drying and sorting. When picking cotton, we also pay great attention to cotton specifications. In order to prevent crushed leaves, soil, and other debris from mixing in, we carry cloth sheets when picking cotton to prevent the picked cotton from touching the ground. After returning home, we also separate, sun-dry, and gin the good cotton from high-yield fields and irrigated fields from ordinary cotton to ensure the purity of the fine varieties. To further improve the quality of cotton, we pay close attention to cotton seed boll selection. On October 2nd alone, our cooperative selected and picked 1,381 jin of large, fluffy top bolls from high-yield fields. This year, we plan to select more high-quality cotton seeds. In addition to using them ourselves next year, we will also promote them extensively to the outside world. We have already received letters from many peasant brothers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces, ordering cotton seeds from us. We have replied to each of them, guaranteeing that we will send them in time after the cotton seeds are ginned, so that more cotton farmers can achieve high yields next year.

We guarantee to fulfill all your hopes for us. At the same time, we will also widely publicize to the cotton farmers in the whole village and county, so that every household will do a good job in the harvesting and packaging of this year's cotton, and ensure that the cotton sent to the processing plant does not contain scorched petals, stiff petals, frost-damaged flowers, and other debris. Please tell the old worker comrades: let them produce even more enthusiastically! We also hope that the old worker comrades will give us more suggestions for improving our work in the future.

Dear Comrade Zhou Zhizhen: We deeply realize how much benefit national construction will bring to us farmers. As soon as we see the high-yield cotton fields, we remember the waterwheels, fertilizers, and pesticides that the state has loaned us...we think of all the facts that the state has helped us overcome difficulties in production. We are sincerely grateful to Chairman Mao and grateful for the correct leadership of the People's Government. We must always listen to Chairman Mao and dedicate our strength to the industrialization of the country. Look! The Soviet socialist female cotton-growing model worker, Bakirova, harvested more than 1,400 jin of cotton per mu in 1947; while we, at most, are only harvesting 800 or 900 jin. This is the result of the Soviet Union's implementation of agricultural collectivization and mechanization. We must now do a good job in agricultural production cooperatives, humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and cotton farmer brothers in various places, continuously improve yield and quality, and vigorously support national economic construction so that the motherland can realize industrialization as soon as possible. At that time, we Chinese farmers will also live a happy life like the current Soviet farmers.

Now, the Party and the People's Government are calling on the people of the whole country to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and that is exactly the purpose. We warmly respond to this call, and the whole cooperative has already formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy. Our plan is to do a good job in the harvesting and quality improvement of this year's cotton. In the past, we did not pay enough attention when picking cotton, and we did not pick it clean. At least ten jin of seed cotton per mu were lost in the high-yield fields; this year, we guarantee that we will pick the cotton clean and pay attention not to touch the fruit branches, not to step on the cotton bolls, and not to drop the cotton flowers, so as to increase the amount of cotton harvested. All 88.6 mu of cotton fields in the cooperative must increase production by at least 525 jin of seed cotton compared to previous years. Strengthen frost and freeze prevention work. In the dense and leafy irrigated cotton fields, implement picking large leaves, removing unproductive bolls, and pruning and merging rows to promote the early maturity of cotton bolls and reduce frost-damaged flowers. Our agricultural production cooperative not only grows cotton, but also grows other crops. In order to complete the task of increasing grain production in the motherland, we must also grow wheat well this year to lay a good foundation for increasing grain production next year. Of the 50.16 mu of wheat land in the cooperative, 32 mu were planted with narrow-row close planting this year. The row spacing was reduced from 9 inches in the past to 6 inches, expanding the sowing area of wheat land by a total of 7.28 mu. In addition, in order to eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows in wheat, the sowing this year was denser than in any previous year, and the sowing technology was improved. In this way, it is estimated that the whole cooperative can increase wheat production by a total of 1,761 jin next year. Saving grain is also a problem that we should pay attention to. We guarantee that we will never be extravagant and wasteful for weddings and funerals; we should usually eat more coarse grains and less refined grains; and we should not eat and drink excessively during the harvest season. All 38 people in the cooperative will save 185 jin of refined grains per month; from October this year to the end of May next year, the whole cooperative will save a total of 1,480 jin of refined grains.

Dear Comrade Zhou Zhizhen: In order to ensure the realization of the above plans, each household has included the plan to increase production and practice economy in their respective "Patriotic Pledges," and will regularly and continuously check the implementation in the future. Let us work together to strive for the early arrival of a happy and fulfilling socialist society.

    曲耀离农业生产合作社全体社员  给全国纺织工业劳动模范周志珍的复信亲爱的周志珍同志：
  我们曲耀离农业生产合作社的全体社员，在十月八日人民日报上，看到了你写给我们社长的信，大伙都感到光荣。因为曲耀离同志参加第三届赴朝慰问团到朝鲜去了，就由我们副社长在社员大会上详详细细地念了你的来信，大家还进行了讨论。
    亲爱的周志珍同志：虽然我们相隔千里，又从来没有见过面，但是，念了你的来信，我们深深感到，你好像是我们的亲姊妹。不，简直比亲姊妹还要亲。你的模范事迹使我们受到鼓舞，我们一定要生产更多更好的棉花，供给国家纺织工业的需要，以满足全国人民对布匹供应的要求。
    去年冬天，在人民政府领导下，我们由互助组转成了农业生产合作社。今年一开春，我们订出了全社一九五三年的棉田增产计划。为了实现这个计划，一年来，我们和旱灾、涝灾、虫灾、冻灾，进行了顽强不息的斗争，赢得了大面积丰产的可能。前几天，我们村评比检查小组测量了一下，估计我们社今年有十六亩四分丰产棉田每亩可以产到籽棉七百斤以上，另有十二亩水地棉花每亩可以产到五百斤以上，二十一亩旱地棉花每亩可以产到二百斤以上。如今，我们社已摘回籽棉一万六千多斤，全社今年有完成总产三万一千斤籽棉的把握。
    我们还十分注意提高棉花质量。今年我们加强了棉田管理、整枝打杈和防治虫害，特别是当棉苗生长后期适时浇了水，就使棉花生长的纤维长、品质好。我们社最近卖给国家的棉花，百分之九十以上都是“一四三○”级花，比当地一般棉农的棉花高两级。我们知道：只有把好的棉花卖给国家，工厂里才能织出好的布匹。我们的口号是：“赖花自己用，好花卖给国家。”因此，当我们每次卖棉花以前，都要进行最后一次翻晒、挑拣。在摘花时，也非常注意棉花规格，为了不使碎叶、土块和其他杂物混入，摘花时都带着布单子，不让摘下的花接触地面。收回家里后，又把丰产地和水地的好棉花和一般棉花分放、分晒、分轧，以保证良种纯度。为了进一步提高棉花质量，我们非常注意棉籽铃选工作，仅十月二日一天时间，我们社里就在丰产地内选摘了朵大绒长的腰花一千三百八十一斤。我们今年准备选出更多的优良棉种，除全社明年自用外，还要大量向外推广。我们现在已经收到江苏、浙江、福建、江西等省很多农民兄弟的来信，向我们订购棉籽，我们都一一复了信，保证轧出棉种后，及时给他们寄去，使更多的棉农兄弟明年都得到丰产。
    你对我们的希望，我们保证全部做到。同时，我们还要向全村、全县棉农兄弟广泛宣传，使每一农户都要做好今年棉花的收获和包装工作，保证送到加工场里的棉花不带焦瓣、僵瓣、霜后花和其他杂物。请你转告工人老大哥们：让他们更加油地生产吧！同时也希望老大哥们今后给我们多提改进工作的意见。
    亲爱的周志珍同志：我们深深地认识，国家建设给我们农民会带来多大的好处。我们一看见丰产的棉田，就记起了国家贷给我们的水车、肥料、药剂……想到了国家帮助我们克服生产上困难的种种事实。我们打心眼里感激毛主席，感激人民政府的正确领导。我们还要永远听毛主席的话，为国家工业化献出自己的力量。你看！苏联社会主义的女植棉劳动模范巴基罗娃同志在一九四七年时每亩棉花就收到一千四百多斤；而我们，现在顶多的才收到八、九百斤。这是苏联实行了农业集体化和机械化的结果。我们现在一定要搞好农业生产合作社，虚心学习苏联和各地棉农兄弟的先进经验，不断提高产量和质量，大力支援国家经济建设，使祖国早日实现工业化。那时，我们中国农民也就会过着和现在苏联农民一样的幸福生活。
    如今，党和人民政府号召全国人民开展增产节约运动，也正是这个目的。我们热烈响应这个号召，全社已经订出了增产节约计划。我们的计划是：做好今年棉花的收获和提高质量的工作。以往我们摘棉花时注意不够，摘不净，丰产地每亩至少要损失十斤籽棉；今年我们保证摘花要摘净，并注意不碰果枝、不踏棉桃、不丢棉朵，增加棉花的收获量。全社八十八亩六分棉田，要做到比往年至少增产五百二十五斤籽棉。加强防霜、防冻工作，在苗稠叶厚的水地棉田里实行摘大叶、打赘铃与整枝、并垄，以促进棉桃的早熟，减少霜后花。我们的农业生产合作社不光是种花，还种有别的庄稼，为完成祖国增产粮食的任务，我们今年还要种好小麦，为明年增产粮食打好基础。全社五十亩一分六厘麦地，今年下种时有三十二亩实行了窄行密植，行距由过去的九寸缩小到六寸，共扩大麦地播种面积七亩二分八厘。此外，为了消灭小麦缺苗断垄现象，今年下种比以往任何一年都稠，并改进了播种技术。这样，预计明年全社一共可以增产小麦一千七百六十一斤。节约粮食，也是我们应注意的问题。我们保证婚丧大事决不铺张浪费；平常要多吃粗粮，少吃细粮；收获季节也不大吃大喝。全社三十八口人，每月要节约细粮一百八十五斤；从今年十月到明年五月底，全社共节约细粮一千四百八十斤。
    亲爱的周志珍同志：为了保证实现以上的计划，我们各户都已把增产节约计划订在各家的“爱国公约”上了，以后并要经常不断地检查执行情况。让咱们一只胳膊上出力，来争取美满幸福的社会主义社会早日到来。
