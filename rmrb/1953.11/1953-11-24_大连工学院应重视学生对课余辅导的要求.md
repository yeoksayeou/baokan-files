    Dalian Institute of Technology Should Pay Attention to Students' Demands for After-School Tutoring

    Chen Zhongshan, Pre-College Class A, Dalian Institute of Technology, writes: I am a student who was transferred from the military to a learning position and assigned by the organization to study in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Dalian Institute of Technology. When we were studying at the Northeast People's University Cadre Remedial Class in Changchun, our grades improved from 80% failing to 80% passing. Comrades entered institutions of higher learning with full confidence. However, after entering Dalian Institute of Technology, the situation changed completely. Soon after we were assigned to undergraduate studies, there was a phenomenon of falling behind. Because of the poor foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, we requested the administrative leaders to assign teachers to provide individual tutoring in the afternoon. The leaders' response was: they are busy with work and have no time. This led to a situation where we were not cared for, and we gradually fell behind seriously. For the sake of teaching convenience and to avoid trouble, the school decided to establish a pre-college program and assigned us to study there (cadre students accounted for more than 70% of the pre-college program). The students fully expected to lay a good foundation through pre-college studies, but unexpectedly, the school adopted a very irresponsible attitude towards pre-college studies. In Pre-College Class A, the algebra started from Chapter 7 of high school algebra, and most students could not understand it and could not do the exercises, and requested assistance. The teacher ignored it, and the administration did not solve it. Comrade Zhou Jihang fell behind in algebra and requested help from the teaching teacher and administrative leaders many times, but none of them were resolved, and he had no choice but to hand in a blank test paper during the test. Due to the Dalian Institute of Technology leadership's indifference and irresponsibility towards the difficulties encountered by the transferred cadre students in their studies, the result was that in Pre-College Class A, out of 39 students, 27 failed in algebra alone; 14 failed in two subjects; and 6 failed in all mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This cannot be said that our quality is too low to be cultivated. Facts have proved that several of our transferred students with poor grades transferred to the undergraduate program of Dalian Maritime College, and they were able to keep up with the courses, and did not even have to take a make-up exam. Dalian Maritime College is also an engineering university, and the basic courses in the first year are almost exactly the same. Although the requirements of each school may be slightly different, it is unlikely that the quality of their first-year undergraduate program is lower than the quality of the pre-college program of Dalian Institute of Technology. The political and ideological leadership of our school is also very weak. Up to now, the school has adopted a delaying attitude towards many opinions raised by the students, neither dealing with them nor answering them, and the ideological emotions of the entire pre-college students are quite chaotic. I hope that relevant departments will understand these situations of Dalian Institute of Technology's irresponsibility towards the studies of pre-college students and help improve them.

### 大连工学院应重视学生对课余辅导的要求

    大连工学院应重视学生对课余辅导的要求
    大连工学院预科甲班陈仲山来信：我是去年由部队调到学习岗位经组织分配派来大连工学院化工系学习的学生。当我们还在长春东北人民大学干部补习班学习时，成绩由编班的百分之八十以上不及格，提高到百分之八十都及了格。同志们满怀信心地进入了高等学校。可是在进入大连工学院后，情况就完全变得不同了。当我们编入本科学习不久，就有掉队的现象。由于原有数理化基础差，我们曾向行政领导要求指派老师利用下午的时间进行个别辅导。领导同志的答复是：工作忙，没有时间。这样就使我们在无人过问的情况下，逐渐发生严重掉队的情况了。为了教学方便避免麻烦，学校决定成立预科，把我们编到预科去学习（干部同学占了预科人数百分之七十以上）。同学们满想通过预科学习打好基础，但出乎意外，校方对预科学习还是采取了极不负责的态度。预科甲班的代数从高中代数第七章起，大多数同学听不懂，作不出练习，要求设法辅导。老师置之不理，行政也不予解决。周吉行同学因代数掉队，曾不知多少次要求教课教员、行政领导方面设法补救，没有一次得到解决，测验时无可奈何地交了白卷。由于大连工学院领导方面对抽调的干部学生在学习中发生的困难熟视无睹，不负责任的结果，预甲全班三十九人中仅代数一门不及格的就有二十七人；两门不及格的十四人；数理化全部不及格的六人。这并不能说我们的质量太低，不能造就。事实证明：我们调来的同学中有几个成绩较差的转到大连航海学院本科去学习，他们课程都能跟上，连一门补考都没有。航海学院同样属于工科的高等学校，一年级的基础课程几乎完全相同，虽然各校要求可能稍有差别，但是，总不致他们一年级本科的质量不及大连工学院预科的质量。我校的政治思想领导也很薄弱，到现在为止，校方对同学们提出的许多意见，仍是采取拖的态度，既不处理，也不解答，整个预科同学的思想情绪相当混乱。我希望有关部门对大连工学院对待预科同学学习不负责任的这些情况进行了解，并帮助改进。
