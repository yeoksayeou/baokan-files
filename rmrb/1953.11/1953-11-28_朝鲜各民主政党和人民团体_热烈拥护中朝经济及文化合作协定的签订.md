Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: Leading figures from various democratic political parties and people's organizations in Korea have issued statements warmly supporting the significant achievements of the negotiations between the governments of China and Korea.

Hong Ki-chu, Vice Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Party, said: "The communiqué of the Sino-Korean government negotiations marks a new development in the friendly relations between the people of China and Korea. We express our warm support with boundless joy. At the same time, the economic and cultural cooperation agreement signed between China and Korea not only further strengthens the traditional and solid friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and expands and develops economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, but also makes a new contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world."

Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, said: "The results of the Sino-Korean government negotiations have important international significance. The communiqué demonstrates the firm will of the people of China and Korea to thoroughly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Today, the American aggressors have not yet abandoned their ambition to invade Korea and are still obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; they will not achieve this shameful goal. The Korean people are determined to fight to the end for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and for peace in the Far East and the world under the banner of great internationalism."

Moon Doo-jae, Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, expressed warm gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese working class on behalf of the Korean working class. He said: "The great assistance of our Chinese brothers is a huge driving force for the recovery and development of our national economy, especially industry. The Korean working class is determined to actively improve work efficiency, strengthen friendship and unity with the working classes of all countries, and bravely march towards new victories."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: "Democratic Korea" and "Rodong Sinmun" both published editorials on the 26th, unanimously supporting the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

The "Democratic Korea" editorial pointed out: "The conclusion of this agreement is an epoch-making event in the struggle of the people of China and Korea to defend peace. It not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and Korea, but also to the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. It not only shows that the Chinese people have once again given sincere internationalist assistance to the Korean people, but also proves the strong unity of the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

The editorial then pointed out: "The signing of this agreement has given the American imperialists a serious warning: despite their constant creation of conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, undermine the firm and unshakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people, and maintain a tense international situation, their attempts are in vain."

The editorial emphasized: "The Korean people unanimously believe that this agreement is another reliable guarantee for the victory of our struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial pointed out: "This agreement truly demonstrates the strong unity of the Asian people and the continuous consolidation of fraternal friendship. No imperialist force can stop the solemn advance of the Asian people."

The editorial said: "We, the Korean people, are filled with strong faith in our future, receiving the internationalist assistance from the people of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries: We will fight more closely united around the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and we will surely accomplish the great cause of restoring and building the post-war national economy and peacefully reunifying the motherland."
