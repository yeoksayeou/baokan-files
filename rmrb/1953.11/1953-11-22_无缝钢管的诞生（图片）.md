    The Birth of Seamless Steel Pipes
    Photography: Our reporter Zhu Bo
    On the afternoon of October 27, 1953, the first seamless steel pipe in Chinese history was born in the steel capital—Anshan. The seamless steel pipe plant began hot trial rolling and was handed over for production on the 31st. This is a panoramic view of the hot rolling section of the seamless steel pipe plant.
    (1) "Heating Furnace." After the steel billet is turned onto the heating furnace table by the turning machine, it rolls into the furnace to be heated to over 1200 degrees. This is the Soviet expert Gerasimov adjusting the pressure gauge inside the continuous heating furnace, while Chinese technicians are learning alongside him.
    (2) "Piercing Mill." After the pusher pushes the red-hot steel billet out of the heating furnace, it reaches the "Piercing Mill." The steel billet is transformed into a seamless steel pipe here.
    (3) "Tube Rolling Mill." After passing through the "Piercing Mill," the wall of the seamless steel pipe is still very thick, and the pipe body is not long enough. The "Tube Rolling Mill" must roll the pipe wall thinner and the pipe body longer. It is one of the main processes for completing seamless steel pipes.
    (4) "Sizing Mill." After passing through the "Tube Rolling Mill," the seamless steel pipe is only rolled to make the pipe wall thinner and the pipe body longer. However, the pipe wall thickness is uneven and not smooth enough. The task of the "Sizing Mill" is to make the seamless steel pipe uniform and smooth.
    (5) "Reducing Mill." After the seamless steel pipe passes through the "Sizing Mill," it still does not meet standard specifications. The "Reducing Mill" sets the diameter to what people require.
    (6) "Cooling Bed." After the seamless steel pipe exits the "Reducing Mill," it is transported by a long automatic roller table to the "Cooling Bed." After the pipe cools down, it goes to the finishing section.
    (7) "Straightening Machine." Its task is to give the pipe the final straightening.
    (8) "Pipe Cutting Machine." After the seamless steel pipe passes through the "Straightening Machine," the two ends of the pipe are very uneven. The "Pipe Cutting Machine" cuts off the two ends according to the required length, making it a seamless steel pipe that meets specifications.
    (9) "Inspection Table." The seamless steel pipe, after undergoing many processes, is undergoing strict inspection by inspection personnel. After being tested by the "Water Pressure Tester," the pressure can reach 80 kg to 200 kg, and the seamless steel pipe becomes a qualified finished product.
    (10) "Main Electrical Room." It is the heart of the entire plant. It is equipped with many complex switchboards, connecting the automated machines of all processes. This is the electrician operating the automatic switch for sending in the power line.

    无缝钢管的诞生
    摄影：本报记者  朱波
    一九五三年十月二十七日下午，中国历史上第一根无缝钢管在钢都——鞍山诞生了，无缝钢管厂开始了热试轧。并于三十一日移交生产。这是无缝钢管厂热轧工段的全景。
    （一）“加热炉”。钢坯被翻料机翻上加热炉台之后，就滚到炉子里去把它加热到一千二百多度。这是苏联专家格拉西莫夫正在调整连续加热炉炉膛内压力仪表，我国技术人员在旁学习的情形。
    （二）“穿孔机”。推料杆把烧红了的钢坯推出加热炉后就到了“穿孔机”。钢坯经过这里变成无缝钢管了。
    （三）“轧管机”。无缝钢管经过“穿孔机”之后管壁还很厚，管身还不够长。必须由“轧管机”把管壁轧薄；管身轧长。它是完成无缝钢管的主要工序之一。
    （四）“均整机”。无缝钢管经过“轧管机”之后只是把管壁轧薄了；管身轧长了。但是管壁薄厚不匀，也不够光滑。“均整机”的任务就是使无缝钢管均匀光滑。 
    （五）“定径机”。无缝钢管经过“均整机”之后，还不能合乎标准规格。“定径机”把直径定成像人们所要求的那样。
    （六）“冷却台”。无缝钢管走出“定径机”之后就被长长的自动辊道运到“冷却台”上。等管冷却后就到精整工段。
    （七）“矫正机”。它的任务就是把管给以最后的矫正。
    （八）“切管机”。无缝钢管经过“矫正机”以后管的两头很不整齐，“切管机”就根据要求的长度把两头切掉，使它成为合乎规格的无缝钢管。
    （九）“检查台”。经过了许多工序的无缝钢管在接受检查人员的严格检查。然后再经过“水压机”的测验，压力能达到八十公斤到二百公斤，无缝钢管就成为合乎规格的成品了。 
    （十）“主电室”。它是全厂的心脏。这里装备着很多复杂的配电盘，联系着全部工序的自动化的机器。这是电工正在操纵送引入线的自动开关的情形。
