    Soviet Workers Struggle to Increase Labor Productivity to Build Communism
    I. Goroshkin, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
    V.I. Lenin, the great founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state, once pointed out that labor productivity is the most important and principal condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system.
    The socialist system has opened up unlimited possibilities for the growth of labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy.
    The Soviet working people are closely concerned with the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Soviet workers understand that the higher their labor productivity, the lower the production cost, the lower the prices of all products and commodities, and the higher the people's living standards. As J.V. Stalin pointed out, in the Soviet Union, labor, which was previously considered a shameful and burdensome burden, has become a glorious cause, an honorable cause, and a cause of pride and heroism. The Soviet people are contributing all their abilities and talents to the great cause of communist construction.
    In the Soviet Union, rapid growth of labor productivity is primarily due to the widespread adoption of new technologies in production, the adoption of advanced technical operating methods, and the mechanization and electrification of heavy and strenuous labor. For this purpose, in the last three years alone, the Soviet machine-building industry has created nearly 1,600 new types of machines and machinery. The total number of machine tools in Soviet enterprises has increased 1.2 times in the post-war period.
    The labor productivity of Soviet workers is constantly improving. In 1952, the labor productivity of workers in industry increased by 60 percent compared with 1940 before the war. Due to the increase in labor productivity, the total industrial output increased by 70 percent during this period.
    The rapid growth of labor productivity and the construction of new enterprises have ensured the rapid development of the national economy in a short period of time.
      In twenty-eight years, industrial output has increased twenty-eight times. At present, the Soviet Union produces twenty times more steel than in 1924-1925, eighteen times more coal, and forty-four times more electricity.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1955 stipulates that labor productivity will increase by approximately 50 percent in industry, approximately 55 percent in construction, and approximately 40 percent in agriculture. Approximately three-quarters of the total increase in industrial output will be achieved by increasing labor productivity.
    In the Soviet Union, the growth of labor productivity does not cause unemployment as it does in capitalist countries. The number of workers and staff employed in the national economy is constantly increasing, totaling 41.7 million at the end of 1952, an increase of 900,000 over 1951.
    The number of workers in all sectors of the Soviet national economy is constantly increasing with the widespread mechanization of the production process. Soviet workers are happy to use machines because machines can reduce their labor and make labor highly productive.
    In the Soviet coal and oil industries, the most important technical operations are almost completely mechanized. A high degree of mechanization has also been achieved in the metallurgical industry, the timber industry, and the construction industry. The light industry has installed more than 170,000 new lathes and machines in the post-war period. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the mechanization of heavy and strenuous labor in industry and construction will be basically completed.
    The Soviet Union now has dozens of automated systems and sections, where all production processes do not require manual labor, and labor productivity here is increased by 10 to 15 times, and in some cases even more.
    At the First Moscow Ball Bearing Factory, an automated continuous device for manufacturing bearing rings has been created. As a result, all manual operations have been eliminated, and the production volume of each lathe has been increased by 25 percent. The labor productivity of workers has increased by 55 percent, freeing up 45 lathe operators, who have been transferred to other departments of the enterprise.
    In the struggle for high labor productivity to build communism, Soviet workers and engineering technicians are constantly improving production technology and technical operating methods, improving labor organization, and proposing and adopting hundreds of thousands of rationalization proposals and inventions in production. Inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals adopted in industry, construction, and transportation in 1952 alone totaled about 800,000. The adoption of these proposals has produced huge economic results.
    Improving the cultural and technical level of the working class is the most important condition for more effectively utilizing new technologies and improving labor productivity.
    In the Soviet Union, great importance is attached to improving the general education level of workers, their technical training, and the development of production skills. All these educational facilities are free and provided by the state. In the years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan alone (1946-1950), the state labor reserve system trained more than three million young workers. During this period, more than 31 million workers received training directly in enterprises and improved their skills. In 1951 and 1952, approximately 15 million people received training without leaving production and improved their skills.
    Due to the continuous growth of the material welfare and cultural and technical level of the working class, the labor enthusiasm of the masses is increasing day by day. Socialist competition, which plays a huge role in communist construction, has a truly nationwide character in the Soviet Union.
    In the competition to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, thousands of capable and courageous innovators have emerged in each industrial sector, who are models of high labor productivity and good at using modern technology.
    Due to the adoption of advanced labor methods in coal mines, the coal extraction volume of mines that adopted new methods increased by an average of 39 percent.
    Metallurgical workers have significantly increased metal production by improving the rapid steelmaking method, and the productivity of furnaces and open-hearth furnaces has been continuously improved.
    Steelworkers Paul Tershkov, Ivan Zilizov, and Anatoly Serkov of the "Red October" factory smelted one out of every two furnaces of steel using the rapid method. They completed the six-month plan ahead of schedule, overproduced more than 2,000 tons of steel, and saved fuel, materials, and electricity worth 114,000 rubles. At present, most metallurgical enterprises in our country have adopted the rapid steelmaking method.
    Machine manufacturing factories have widely adopted various high-speed cutting methods. Due to the adoption of these methods for work, the labor productivity on ordinary lathes has increased many times.
    Soviet advanced workers are discovering endless potential to improve labor productivity and increase production.
    The weaving team of Serafima Kotova, a textile worker at the Kalinin Woolen Factory in Moscow, proposed a valuable initiative. After studying the labor methods of advanced textile workers, the Kotova team launched a competition to fully utilize all production potential. Now this team produces more than 80 kilograms of yarn above the quota in each shift. This team produced more than 2,000 kilograms of yarn above the plan in September. These yarns can be woven into wool fabrics that can sew more than 2,000 sets of clothes.
    In the socialist competition for improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and improving product quality, the creative cooperation between production workers and scientific workers has been widely developed. This cooperation is constantly developing and consolidating, promoting the advancement of production, and enriching science with the valuable experience of practitioners.
    The Party, trade unions, and economic organizations fully support advanced working methods, promote the experience of innovators among the entire working masses, and help the backward to improve to the level of the advanced. The entire great power of competition is used to solve the magnificent tasks of communist construction.
    In the socialist economic system, the consistent high growth of production and the continuous improvement of labor productivity are the basis for the increase in national income. This makes it possible for the Communist Party and the Soviet government to implement a policy of constantly reducing the prices of daily necessities, thereby increasing the real wages of workers and staff and the real income of farmers.
    In the Soviet Union, all national income belongs to the working people, and it is now more than doubled compared to 1940.
    In 1952, the real income of workers and staff increased by approximately 68 percent per capita compared to 1940, and the real income of farmers increased by 73 percent per capita. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the real income of workers and staff will be further increased by at least 35 percent, and the cash income and in-kind income of collective farm members will increase by 40 percent. Large-scale housing construction and cultural construction plans are being implemented, and residents' loans, medical care appropriations, subsidies, and pensions are increasing.
    All this makes workers more concerned about improving labor productivity, and all this is a clear manifestation of the unity of the interests of the Soviet state and the interests of the working masses.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy, like the previous four five-year plans, is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. The development of the Soviet economy, like the development of the economies of People's China and various people's democratic countries, is conducive to peace and to improving the material welfare of the masses. The Soviet nationalities, the united and powerful democratic camp of free nationalities, are ardently concerned with maintaining and consolidating the cause of peace, because under peaceful conditions, they can realize their great peaceful construction plans more quickly on the basis of mutual fraternal assistance.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet working people are constantly improving labor productivity, consolidating the economic power of the socialist motherland, and ensuring the high growth of people's living standards.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people, who were the first to embark on the socialist road, hope that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve new achievements in the great construction cause of a free and increasingly prosperous People's China, and ensure that in order to consolidate peace and international security, we will continue to strengthen the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two peoples.

    苏联工人为建成共产主义而从事提高劳动生产率的斗争
    全苏工会中央理事会书记　伊·戈罗希金
    苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的伟大奠基人乌·伊·列宁曾经指出，劳动生产率是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。
    社会主义制度给国民经济一切部门中劳动生产率的增长开辟了无限的可能性。
    苏联劳动人民密切地关怀着劳动生产率的不断提高。苏联工人懂得，他们的劳动生产率愈高，则生产成本愈低，一切产品和商品的价格也愈低，而人民的生活水平就愈高。正如约·维·斯大林所指出的，在苏联，劳动由从前认为是可耻的和繁重的负担，变成了光荣的事业，荣耀的事业，豪迈和英勇的事业。苏联人民把他们的全部能力和才干贡献给伟大的共产主义建设事业。
    在苏联，劳动生产率得以迅速增长，首先是由于在生产中广泛采用新的技术，采用先进的技术作业法，由于繁重费力的劳动的机械化和电气化。为了这个目的，仅仅在最近三年中，苏联的机器制造业就创造了将近一千六百种新型的机器和机械。苏联企业的车床总数在战后时期增加了一点二倍。
    苏联工人的劳动生产率在不断提高。一九五二年工业中工人的劳动生产率比战前一九四○年提高了百分之六十。由于劳动生产率的提高，工业总产量在此期间增加了百分之七十。
    劳动生产率的迅速增长，以及新企业的建设，保证了国家经济在短时期内有了迅速的发展。
      二十八年来，工业产量增加了二十八倍。现时，苏联生产的钢比一九二四—一九二五年度增加了二十倍，煤增加了十八倍，电力增加了四十四倍。
    一九五一—一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划规定，劳动生产率在工业方面大约提高百分之五十，在建筑业方面大约提高百分之五十五，在农业方面大约提高百分之四十。工业的全部增产量大约有四分之三要靠提高劳动生产率来达到。
    在苏联，劳动生产率的增长不会像在资本主义国家内那样造成失业现象。国民经济中在业的工人和职员的数目在不断增加，一九五二年底共有四千一百七十万人，比一九五一年增加了九十万人。
    苏联国民经济一切部门工人的数目随着生产过程的广泛机械化而不断增加。苏联工人乐于使用机器，因为机器可以减轻他们的劳动并使劳动具有高度的生产效能。
    在苏联的煤炭工业和石油工业中，最主要的技术操作过程几乎完全机械化了。在冶金工业、木材工业和建筑业中，也都达到了高度的机械化。轻工业在战后时期装设了十七万台以上的新车床和机器。在第五个五年计划期间，将要基本上完成工业和建筑业中繁重费力的劳动的机械化。
    苏联现在有数十个自动化系统和工段，这里的一切生产过程都不用手工劳动，劳动生产率在这里提高到十至十五倍，而在有些情况下提高得更要多些。
    在莫斯科第一轴承工厂中创立了制造轴承圈的自动化的连续装置。因此，取消了一切手工操作，使每个车床的生产量得以增加百分之二十五。工人的劳动生产率提高了百分之五十五，从而腾出了四十五个车工，调到本企业的其他部门去。
    在为建成共产主义而争取高度的劳动生产率的斗争过程中，苏联工人和工程技术人员不断地改进生产技术和技术作业法，改善劳动组织，提出和采用数十万件生产上的合理化建议和发明。在工业、建筑业和运输业中被采纳的发明创造、技术改进和合理化建议，仅在一九五二年就有八十万件左右。这些建议的采用，产生了巨大的经济效果。
    工人阶级文化技术水平的提高，是更加有效地利用新技术和提高劳动生产率的最重要条件。
    在苏联，工人一般教育水平的提高、他们的技术训练和生产技艺的发展，受到十分的重视。所有这些教育设施都是免费的，由国家供给的。仅在第四个五年计划的年代里（一九四六—一九五○年），国家劳动后备系统就培养了三百多万青年工人。在这个时期中，有三千一百万以上的工人在企业里直接受到了训练，提高了自己的技艺。在一九五一年和一九五二年内，约有一千五百万人不脱离生产而受到了训练，提高了自己的技艺。
    由于工人阶级的物质福利和文化技术水平的不断增长，群众的劳动积极性日益提高。在共产主义建设中起着巨大作用的社会主义竞赛，在苏联具有真正全民的性质。
    在争取完成和超额完成第五个五年计划的竞赛中，每个工业部门涌现出成千的干练的和勇敢的革新者，他们是具有高度劳动生产率的、善于运用现代技术的模范。
    由于在煤矿中采用了先进的劳动方法，那些采用新方法的矿坑，煤的开采量平均提高了百分之三十九。
    冶金业工人由于改善了快速炼钢法，使金属产量有了显著的增加，使熔炉和马丁炉的生产率不断提高。
    “红十月”工厂的炼钢工人保尔·捷尔什科夫、伊凡·日里佐夫和安纳托里·谢尔科夫所炼的每两炉钢中，有一炉是用快速方法进行冶炼的。他们提前完成了半年的计划，超额生产了两千余吨的钢，节省了十一万四千卢布价值的燃料、材料和电力。现时我国大多数冶金企业都采用了快速炼钢法。
    机器制造工厂广泛地采用了各种高速切削法。由于采用这些方法进行工作，普通镟床上劳动的生产率提高了许多倍。
    苏联的先进工人正在发掘无穷无尽的潜能，来提高劳动生产率和增加产量。
    莫斯科的加里宁毛纺工厂纺织女工谢拉菲玛·科托娃小组提出了宝贵的倡议。科托娃小组研究了先进纺织女工的劳动方法以后，发起了争取全面利用一切生产潜力的竞赛。现在这个小组在每班时间内生产出超过定额八十多公斤的纱。这个小组在九月份超计划多生产了两千公斤以上的纱。用这些纱可以织出能缝两千多套衣服的毛布。
    在为提高劳动生产率、降低成本和改进产品质量而进行的社会主义竞赛中，生产工作者与科学工作者的创造性的合作得到了广泛的发展。这种合作不断地发展和巩固，促进生产向前发展，并以实践者的宝贵经验来丰富科学。
    党、工会和经济组织全力支持先进的工作方法，在全体劳动群众中推广革新者的经验，帮助落后的提高到先进者的水平。竞赛的全部伟大力量是用来解决宏伟的共产主义建设任务的。
    在社会主义经济体系中，生产的一贯高涨和劳动生产率的不断提高，是国民收入增加的基础。这就使得共产党和苏联政府有可能实现不断降低日用品价格的政策，从而提高工人和职员的实际工资与农民的实际收入。
    在苏联，国民收入全部属于劳动人民所有，现在它比一九四○年增加了一倍多。
    一九五二年工人和职员的实际收入平均每人较一九四○年增加了大约百分之六十八，农民的实际收入平均每人增加了百分之七十三。在第五个五年计划中规定，工人和职员的实际收入将进一步提高到至少增加百分之三十五，集体农庄庄员的现金收入和实物收入将增加百分之四十。大规模的住宅建筑和文化建设计划正在实现，居民的贷款、医疗事业的拨款、补助金和养老金都在增加。
    所有这一切使工人更加关心劳动生产率的提高，所有这一切正是苏维埃国家利益和劳动群众利益一致的鲜明表现。
    苏联国民经济发展第五个五年计划，和以前的四个五年计划同样是和平的经济与文化建设的计划。苏联经济的发展，和人民中国及各人民民主国家经济的发展同样是有利于和平的，有利于提高群众的物质福利的。苏联各民族，团结一致的强大的民主阵营的各自由民族，热烈地关怀着维护和巩固和平的事业，因为在和平的条件下，他们在彼此友爱互助的基础上就能更快地实现他们伟大的和平建设计划。
    苏联劳动人民在共产党的领导下，不断地提高劳动生产率，巩固社会主义祖国的经济威力，保证人民生活水平的高涨。
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年的日子里，第一个走上社会主义道路的苏联人民，热望兄弟般的中国人民在自由和日益繁荣的人民中国的伟大建设事业中获得新的成就，并保证为了巩固和平和国际安全，今后不断加强我们两国人民的兄弟般的友谊与合作。
