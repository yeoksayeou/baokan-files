    Soviet Workers Struggle to Increase Labor Productivity to Build Communism
    I. Goroshkin, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
    V.I. Lenin, the great founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state, once pointed out that labor productivity is the most important and principal condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system.
    The socialist system has opened up unlimited possibilities for the growth of labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy.
    The Soviet working people are closely concerned with the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Soviet workers understand that the higher their labor productivity, the lower the production cost, the lower the prices of all products and commodities, and the higher the people's living standards. As J.V. Stalin pointed out, in the Soviet Union, labor, which was previously considered a shameful and burdensome burden, has become a glorious cause, an honorable cause, and a cause of pride and heroism. The Soviet people are contributing all their abilities and talents to the great cause of communist construction.
    In the Soviet Union, rapid growth of labor productivity is primarily due to the widespread adoption of new technologies in production, the adoption of advanced technical operating methods, and the mechanization and electrification of heavy and strenuous labor. For this purpose, in the last three years alone, the Soviet machine-building industry has created nearly 1,600 new types of machines and machinery. The total number of machine tools in Soviet enterprises has increased 1.2 times in the post-war period.
    The labor productivity of Soviet workers is constantly improving. In 1952, the labor productivity of workers in industry increased by 60 percent compared with 1940 before the war. Due to the increase in labor productivity, the total industrial output increased by 70 percent during this period.
    The rapid growth of labor productivity and the construction of new enterprises have ensured the rapid development of the national economy in a short period of time.
      In twenty-eight years, industrial output has increased twenty-eight times. At present, the Soviet Union produces twenty times more steel than in 1924-1925, eighteen times more coal, and forty-four times more electricity.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1955 stipulates that labor productivity will increase by approximately 50 percent in industry, approximately 55 percent in construction, and approximately 40 percent in agriculture. Approximately three-quarters of the total increase in industrial output will be achieved by increasing labor productivity.
    In the Soviet Union, the growth of labor productivity does not cause unemployment as it does in capitalist countries. The number of workers and staff employed in the national economy is constantly increasing, totaling 41.7 million at the end of 1952, an increase of 900,000 over 1951.
    The number of workers in all sectors of the Soviet national economy is constantly increasing with the widespread mechanization of the production process. Soviet workers are happy to use machines because machines can reduce their labor and make labor highly productive.
    In the Soviet coal and oil industries, the most important technical operations are almost completely mechanized. A high degree of mechanization has also been achieved in the metallurgical industry, the timber industry, and the construction industry. The light industry has installed more than 170,000 new lathes and machines in the post-war period. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the mechanization of heavy and strenuous labor in industry and construction will be basically completed.
    The Soviet Union now has dozens of automated systems and sections, where all production processes do not require manual labor, and labor productivity here is increased by 10 to 15 times, and in some cases even more.
    At the First Moscow Ball Bearing Factory, an automated continuous device for manufacturing bearing rings has been created. As a result, all manual operations have been eliminated, and the production volume of each lathe has been increased by 25 percent. The labor productivity of workers has increased by 55 percent, freeing up 45 lathe operators, who have been transferred to other departments of the enterprise.
    In the struggle for high labor productivity to build communism, Soviet workers and engineering technicians are constantly improving production technology and technical operating methods, improving labor organization, and proposing and adopting hundreds of thousands of rationalization proposals and inventions in production. Inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals adopted in industry, construction, and transportation in 1952 alone totaled about 800,000. The adoption of these proposals has produced huge economic results.
    Improving the cultural and technical level of the working class is the most important condition for more effectively utilizing new technologies and improving labor productivity.
    In the Soviet Union, great importance is attached to improving the general education level of workers, their technical training, and the development of production skills. All these educational facilities are free and provided by the state. In the years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan alone (1946-1950), the state labor reserve system trained more than three million young workers. During this period, more than 31 million workers received training directly in enterprises and improved their skills. In 1951 and 1952, approximately 15 million people received training without leaving production and improved their skills.
    Due to the continuous growth of the material welfare and cultural and technical level of the working class, the labor enthusiasm of the masses is increasing day by day. Socialist competition, which plays a huge role in communist construction, has a truly nationwide character in the Soviet Union.
    In the competition to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, thousands of capable and courageous innovators have emerged in each industrial sector, who are models of high labor productivity and good at using modern technology.
    Due to the adoption of advanced labor methods in coal mines, the coal extraction volume of mines that adopted new methods increased by an average of 39 percent.
    Metallurgical workers have significantly increased metal production by improving the rapid steelmaking method, and the productivity of furnaces and open-hearth furnaces has been continuously improved.
    Steelworkers Paul Tershkov, Ivan Zilizov, and Anatoly Serkov of the "Red October" factory smelted one out of every two furnaces of steel using the rapid method. They completed the six-month plan ahead of schedule, overproduced more than 2,000 tons of steel, and saved fuel, materials, and electricity worth 114,000 rubles. At present, most metallurgical enterprises in our country have adopted the rapid steelmaking method.
    Machine manufacturing factories have widely adopted various high-speed cutting methods. Due to the adoption of these methods for work, the labor productivity on ordinary lathes has increased many times.
    Soviet advanced workers are discovering endless potential to improve labor productivity and increase production.
    The weaving team of Serafima Kotova, a textile worker at the Kalinin Woolen Factory in Moscow, proposed a valuable initiative. After studying the labor methods of advanced textile workers, the Kotova team launched a competition to fully utilize all production potential. Now this team produces more than 80 kilograms of yarn above the quota in each shift. This team produced more than 2,000 kilograms of yarn above the plan in September. These yarns can be woven into wool fabrics that can sew more than 2,000 sets of clothes.
    In the socialist competition for improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and improving product quality, the creative cooperation between production workers and scientific workers has been widely developed. This cooperation is constantly developing and consolidating, promoting the advancement of production, and enriching science with the valuable experience of practitioners.
    The Party, trade unions, and economic organizations fully support advanced working methods, promote the experience of innovators among the entire working masses, and help the backward to improve to the level of the advanced. The entire great power of competition is used to solve the magnificent tasks of communist construction.
    In the socialist economic system, the consistent high growth of production and the continuous improvement of labor productivity are the basis for the increase in national income. This makes it possible for the Communist Party and the Soviet government to implement a policy of constantly reducing the prices of daily necessities, thereby increasing the real wages of workers and staff and the real income of farmers.
    In the Soviet Union, all national income belongs to the working people, and it is now more than doubled compared to 1940.
    In 1952, the real income of workers and staff increased by approximately 68 percent per capita compared to 1940, and the real income of farmers increased by 73 percent per capita. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the real income of workers and staff will be further increased by at least 35 percent, and the cash income and in-kind income of collective farm members will increase by 40 percent. Large-scale housing construction and cultural construction plans are being implemented, and residents' loans, medical care appropriations, subsidies, and pensions are increasing.
    All this makes workers more concerned about improving labor productivity, and all this is a clear manifestation of the unity of the interests of the Soviet state and the interests of the working masses.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy, like the previous four five-year plans, is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. The development of the Soviet economy, like the development of the economies of People's China and various people's democratic countries, is conducive to peace and to improving the material welfare of the masses. The Soviet nationalities, the united and powerful democratic camp of free nationalities, are ardently concerned with maintaining and consolidating the cause of peace, because under peaceful conditions, they can realize their great peaceful construction plans more quickly on the basis of mutual fraternal assistance.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet working people are constantly improving labor productivity, consolidating the economic power of the socialist motherland, and ensuring the high growth of people's living standards.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people, who were the first to embark on the socialist road, hope that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve new achievements in the great construction cause of a free and increasingly prosperous People's China, and ensure that in order to consolidate peace and international security, we will continue to strengthen the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two peoples.
