    New Zigong Salt Plant Begins Production
    The largest basic construction project in the Southwest salt industry, the Zigong Salt Plant, has essentially completed the main factory buildings, workshops, and related civil engineering and mechanical installation projects for direct production in 1953. Trial runs began on September 28th. During the trial period, the machinery and equipment operated normally and in good condition. The salt production and by-product factories were handed over to the production departments for production on October 20th and 23rd, respectively.
    The Zigong Salt Plant is a newly built project in the first year of China's Five-Year Plan. The plant's construction area this year is 12,000 square meters, with a construction area of approximately 160,000 square meters. The current salt production will account for 13.33% of the city's highest annual output, and by-products will be more than twice the city's output of similar by-products. The sodium chloride content in the salt will increase from the general content of 93% to 95% to 96% to 98%, and the cost will also be greatly reduced. The labor conditions for workers have also been greatly improved. The successful construction of the plant will replace the scattered and backward handicraft-style salt production that has existed for thousands of years with machine production, using electricity and steam to replace heavy manual labor. One of the main products of the plant, edible salt, is not only the best edible salt for the people of Southwest China, but also the best raw material for the production of caustic soda and chlorine gas. Several by-products produced by a by-product factory that has already been built and by by-product factories that will be built in the Five-Year Plan will be important raw materials for national defense industry, heavy industry, and other light industries such as enamel and medicine.
    Currently, the plant's design department is concentrating its efforts on the drilling and design work for 1954, actively preparing for next year's construction projects.

    自贡制盐新厂开始投入生产
    西南盐业最大的基本建设工程——自贡制盐新厂，一九五三年度建筑的主要厂房、车间和有关直接生产的土木建筑、机械安装工程已基本完成。九月二十八日开始试车。在试车期中，机器设备运转正常，情况良好。制盐和副产品工厂先后在十月二十日、二十三日起移交生产部门开始生产。
    自贡制盐新厂是我国开始五年计划建设第一年新建的工程。该厂在今年的建筑面积为一万二千平方公尺，施工面积约十六万平方公尺。目前开始生产的食盐产量，将占全市最高年产量的百分之十三点三三，副产品将为全市同类副产品产量两倍以上。盐中氯化钠的含量，将由一般含量百分之九十三到九十五提高到百分之九十六到九十八，成本也将大大降低。并大大地改善了工人的劳动条件。该厂建设成功，将使千百年来分散落后的手工业式的盐业生产，为机器生产所代替，将用电力和蒸气来代替笨重的体力劳动。该厂的主要产品之一的食盐，不仅是西南人民饮食中最好的食盐，而且是制取苛性钠及氯气的最好原料。已经修建好的一种副产品工厂和五年计划中将修建的副产品工厂所出产的数种副产品，将是国防工业、重工业和其他搪瓷医药等轻工业的重要原料。
    现在，该厂设计部门正集中力量进行一九五四年的钻探、设计工作，积极准备明年的建设工程。
