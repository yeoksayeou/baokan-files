    The Phenomenon of Personnel Backlog Must Be Changed

    Editor's Note: Cadres are extremely valuable assets in national construction. Paying full attention to cultivating and leveraging the strength of cadres in various construction endeavors is a concrete manifestation of cherishing cadres and cherishing national construction. However, according to readers' letters we have recently received, some organizations exhibit the phenomenon of personnel backlog and overstaffing, causing some cadres to suffer from having no work to do all day. Research into the reasons for personnel backlog in these organizations reveals roughly three types: One is that a batch of cadres is temporarily stored due to the needs of work development; another is due to poor planning and lack of experience; and the third is due to the evils of departmentalism. Of course, temporarily storing some cadres to prepare conditions for newly built enterprises and work that is about to begin in order to meet the needs of work development is permissible and reasonable; however, attention must be paid to cultivating and educating these cadres to truly prepare for the needs of work development, and cadres cannot be allowed to be idle all day, neglecting their work and becoming depressed. We believe that the phenomenon of neglecting the cultivation of cadres and allowing them to neglect their work must be changed, and the situation of lack of experience and poor planning must also be improved by learning from past lessons. As for the phenomenon of departmentalism disregarding the overall situation and long-term backlog of talents urgently needed by other units, it must be resolutely corrected.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    必须改变人员积压的现象
    编者按：干部是国家建设中极其宝贵的资本，在各项建设中充分注意培养干部、发挥干部的力量，即是爱护干部、爱护国家建设的具体表现。但据我们近来收到的读者来信反映：有某些机关却存在着人员积压、人浮于事的现象，以致有些干部因整天没有工作而苦恼。研究这些机关积压人员的原因大体有如下三种：一种是由于工作发展的需要，暂时储存了一批干部；一种是由于计划不周，缺乏经验；再一种就是由于本位主义思想作怪。当然，为了工作发展的需要暂时储存一些干部，给新建企业和即将开办的工作准备条件，这是允许的，也是合理的；但是，必须注意对这些干部进行培养教育，真正为工作发展的需要作好准备，不能任凭干部终日没有事，荒废业务而苦闷起来。我们认为，忽视对干部培养而任凭其荒废业务的现象必须改变，对缺乏经验、计划不周的情况也必须接受过去教训力加改进。至于本位主义不顾整体，把其它单位迫切需要的人材长期积压起来的现象，则必须坚决纠正。
