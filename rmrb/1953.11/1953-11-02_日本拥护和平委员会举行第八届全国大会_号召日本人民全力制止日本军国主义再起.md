Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st dispatch: The Eighth National Congress of the Japan Peace Protection Committee was held in Tokyo on October 3rd and 4th. A total of 95 peace representatives from the central government and 23 prefectures attended the conference. Based on the principles of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting resolution on striving for negotiation movements, combined with Japan's specific circumstances, the conference discussed the current peace movement in Japan, decided on a new direction for the peace movement, and adopted many important resolutions and a "Letter to the People."

At the beginning of the conference, Yoshitaro Hirano, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, and Kinichi Yoshioka, Kenjuro Yanagida, Shoji Ogata, Yasugo Hayakawa, and two others were elected to the presidium, and then listened to relevant reports. Yashiro Ii, Director of the Secretariat of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, reported on the rapid development of the Japanese peace movement in the half year since the "Japanese People's Conference for Peace" was held in March this year. Goro Hani, a famous Japanese peace activist, gave a "Report on the World People's Peace Conference and the World Peace Council Meeting." He pointed out that preventing the war crisis is the obligation of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people must clearly realize the threat of the re-emergence of Japanese militarism to world peace. He emphasized that the Japanese peace movement must be developed and expanded rapidly, because Japan has become a war base that threatens peace. Next, Yoshitaro Hirano gave a report entitled "On the Domestic and International Situation and Japan's Situation," saying that Japan's current situation is controlled by the San Francisco Separate Peace Treaty. From the signing of the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" to the US Mutual Security Agency "Aid" negotiations, the constraints on Japan are being strengthened. He finally said that today Japan's peace forces are developing forward, and the scale of the movement is much larger than before.

The second day of the conference focused on discussing important proposals such as the "New Direction for the Peace Movement" and "On the Current Peace Movement." The "New Direction for the Peace Movement," which was unanimously adopted by the conference after heated discussions, stipulates: 1. Launch an international consultation movement; 2. Take the following specific measures to ease the tension in Japan: restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that have not concluded peace treaties, oppose US Mutual Security Agency "Aid," oppose rearmament, oppose military bases, promote international economic development and cultural exchanges, and promote the success of the Korean Political Conference to continue to ease international tensions; 3. Unify peace forces, etc. At the same time, the conference passed a resolution on the "Current Peace Movement," which included: calling on the people of Japan to hold a "National Conference for Peace Consultation" on November 28th and 29th to expand the peace front; holding rallies against US Mutual Security Agency "Aid" and against rearmament; launching a movement to invite delegations from the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan; holding a conference to celebrate Ikuo Oyama's winning of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" and Toshiko Akamatsu and Iri Maruki's winning of the International Peace Prize, as well as Hiroshi Suekawa and other new members of the World Peace Council, and holding various lectures and preparing for the New Year's peace movement.

The conference resolved to support the declarations and resolutions of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting and requested the Japanese government to support the holding of a peace conference by the five major powers. The conference also demanded a fair trial for the defendants in the Matsukawa incident.

The "Letter to the People" unanimously adopted by the conference stated: "The desire for peace of the people of the world has united into a huge force driving history forward. Solving international disputes through consultation instead of force and threats has become the consensus of the world, and this public opinion has become boiling." The statement pointed out: "Japan is currently being unreasonably pushed in the direction of the flashpoint of a world war, which is a dangerous thing and more terrible than the last war. In any case, we must now block this path that leads to destruction instead of advancing in the direction of world peace." The statement called on the Japanese people to unite, launch various struggles, and work together to defend peace.

At the end of the conference, Yoshitaro Hirano delivered a closing speech. He said: We must never let the peace forces stand still. We must unite further and fight for peace. He called on the representatives to widely publicize the various resolutions of the conference to the people of the country, so that Japan's peace movement will develop by leaps and bounds.

    日本拥护和平委员会举行第八届全国大会
    号召日本人民全力制止日本军国主义再起
    【新华社一日讯】东京迟到消息：日本拥护和平委员会第八届全国大会已于十月三日和四日在东京举行。出席大会的有中央和二十三个都、道府、县的和平代表共九十五人。大会根据世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议关于争取协商运动的决议的原则，结合日本的具体情况，讨论了日本当前的和平运动，决定了和平运动新方针，并通过了许多重要决议和“告人民书”。
    大会在开幕之初，选出了日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎以及吉冈金市、柳田谦十郎、尾形昭二、早川康戈等五人为主席团，然后听取了有关报告。日本拥护和平委员会事务局长伊井弥四郎，报告了自今年三月召开“日本人民争取和平大会”以后半年来日本和平运动的迅速发展情况。日本著名和平人士羽仁五郎在会上作了“世界人民和平大会和世界和平理事会会议的报告”。他指出：防止战争危机是日本人民的义务，日本人民必须明确地认识到日本军国主义再起对世界和平的威胁。他强调说：必须飞跃地发展和扩大日本的和平运动，因为日本已经成为威胁和平的战争基地。接着，平野义太郎以“关于国内外形势和日本处境”为题作报告说：日本目前的处境是受着旧金山单独和约的控制，从美日“行政协定”的签订到美国共同安全署
  “援助”谈判，都在加强着对日本的束缚。他最后说：今天日本的和平力量正在向前发展，运动的规模已较前壮大得多。
    大会的第二天着重讨论了“和平运动新方针”和“关于当前和平运动”等重要议案。经过热烈讨论而获得大会一致通过的“和平运动新方针”规定：一、展开国际协商运动；二、通过下列具体措施以缓和日本的紧张局势：恢复日本与中苏两国及其他未媾和国家的邦交，反对美国共同安全署“援助”、反对重整军备、反对军事基地，促进国际间的经济发展和文化交流，促进朝鲜政治会议的成功以继续缓和国际紧张局势；三、统一和平力量等。同时，大会通过了“关于当前和平运动”的决议，其中包括：号召日本全国人民于十一月二十八日、二十九日两天举行“全国争取和平协商大会”，扩大和平战线；举行反对美国共同安全署“援助”和反对重整军备的集会；展开邀请中国红十字会代表团和中国人民政治协商会议代表团访问日本的运动；举行庆祝大山郁夫荣获“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金及赤松俊子、丸木位里荣获国际和平奖金以及末川博等新任世界和平理事会理事的大会，以及举办各种讲演会，筹备新年和平运动等。
    大会决议支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的宣言和决议，并要求日本政府拥护五大国举行和平会议。大会并要求公正审判松川事件被告。
    大会一致通过的“告人民书”说：“全世界人民要求和平的心愿，已团结成为推动历史前进的巨大力量。不用武力和威胁而用协商办法来解决国际争端，已经成为全世界的舆论，并且这种舆论已经沸腾起来。”文告指出：“日本目前正被无理地推往世界战争的导火点的方向，这实在是一件危险的事情，是比上一次战争更为可怕的事情。无论如何，我们现在必须堵死这个不往世界和平的方向前进而往毁灭方向前进的道路。”文告号召日本人民团结起来，展开各种斗争，同心协力地保卫和平。
    大会最后由平野义太郎致闭幕词。他说：我们绝不能让和平力量停足不前，我们要更进一步团结起来为和平而奋斗。他号召代表们向全国人民广泛宣传大会的各项决议，使日本的和平运动向前飞跃发展。
