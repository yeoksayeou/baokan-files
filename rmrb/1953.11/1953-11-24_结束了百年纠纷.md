    Ending a Century of Conflict

    Under our country's superior system of people's democracy, any disputes between nationalities and within nationalities can be properly resolved through mediation. The successful resolution of a century-old dispute between Tibetan people in the border area of Tongren and Jianzha counties in Qinghai province, as reported by the Qinghai Daily on August 11, is a vivid example.

    According to the Qinghai Daily, for over a century, the Tibetan people in the border area of Tongren and Jianzha counties in Qinghai Province had engaged in械斗 [armed clashes], resulting in the deaths of eighty-three people, and astonishing losses of property. In the last thirty years alone, losses of livestock and property amounted to over 2.1 billion yuan in Renminbi. Due to the influence of historical disputes, the resentment between the two sides remained deep after liberation. In March of this year, a retaliatory incident occurred in which six people, including Lanba from Tongren County, killed Daluo from Jianzha County. After the incident, the party and government leaders of Tongren and Jianzha counties immediately persuaded the masses, preventing the incident from escalating. The provincial leadership also dispatched an investigation team to the scene of the incident to ascertain the facts. Then, in May, they convened representatives from both sides for mediation. During the mediation process, by getting to the root of the matter, both sides realized that the past feuds and armed clashes were entirely the result of exploitation, plunder, instigation, and "borrowed knife" tactics by the reactionary rulers of the past. At the mediation meeting, concrete examples were used to illustrate the benefits of unity and harmony for the people of both sides, and that mutual retaliation and feuds would never lead to the development of production or the attainment of happiness.

    This mediation first involved full consultation with leading figures who had contact with the masses and with the families of the deceased to reach a consensus. Then, they were sent to get through to the masses ideologically and eliminate hatred. The principle of the mediation was to emphasize that past wrongs would not be held accountable, no compensation or refunds would be made, and old accounts would be written off, fundamentally ending the dispute. Under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, after repeated deliberations and consultations by representatives from both sides, in addition to properly and specifically handling this unfortunate incident, both sides also adopted an agreement to strengthen unity. The agreement stated: "...Numerous painful lessons have deeply educated us that we should further enhance our understanding, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy. For the sake of our happiness and the happiness of our children and grandchildren, we sincerely wish to respect and accommodate each other, closely unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, live in harmony in the warm big family of all nationalities of the motherland, and strive to build our happy life."

    The Qinghai Daily believes that the successful resolution of this incident has once again created a model for mediating ethnic disputes. The newspaper introduced the experience of mediating this dispute in detail.

    结束了百年纠纷
    在我国优越的人民民主制度下，任何民族间和民族内部的纠纷，都是可以用调解的方式取得妥善解决的。八月十一日青海日报报道的该省同仁和尖扎两县交界处藏族人民间百年纠纷的圆满解决，就是一个生动的例子。
    据青海日报报道，青海省同仁和尖扎两县交界处的藏族人民间，百余年以来曾因械斗死了八十三人，人民财产的损失也很惊人。仅近三十年来，牲畜、财物的损失折合人民币就达二十一亿多。因受历史纠纷的影响，解放后双方积怨仍然很深，今年三月间又发生了同仁县兰巴等六人杀死尖扎县达洛的报复事件。事情发生后，同仁、尖扎两县党政领导机关即时说服了群众，未使这一事件扩大。省级领导机关并派出了调查组，到出事地点查明了事实真相。然后在五月间召集双方代表进行调解。在调解过程中，用追根究底的办法，使双方认识了过去的仇杀械斗完全是历来反动统治者欺榨、掠夺、挑拨、借刀杀人的结果。在调解会上又用具体的例子说明团结和好对双方人民的好处，互相报复仇杀，则永远不会发展生产，得到幸福。
    这次调解是首先和与群众有联系的领袖人物及死者家属充分协商，取得一致认识后，再由他们去打通群众思想，消除群众仇恨。调解的原则是：强调既往不咎，不赔不退，旧账一笔勾消，从根本上结束纠纷。在当地党政机关领导下，经过双方代表反复酝酿、协商后，除对这次不幸事件作了妥善的具体的处理外，双方并且通过了加强团结的协议书。协议书中说：“……多次的痛苦教训，深深的教育我们应进一步提高认识，分清敌我，为了我们和子孙的幸福，我们衷心愿意互敬互让，亲密团结在毛主席的领导下，在祖国各民族温暖的大家庭中和睦相处，努力建设我们幸福的生活。”
    青海日报认为这一事件的圆满解决再一次创造了调解民族纠纷的典范。报纸较为详细地介绍了调解这次纠纷的经验。
