    State-Owned Foreign Trade System Achieves Results in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Completing 85% of the Annual Profit Delivery Task

    Under the direct leadership of local Party committees and governments, the movement to increase production and practice economy in state-owned foreign trade enterprises has now been fully launched. All units are implementing the requirements and measures for increasing production and practicing economy, focusing on all important aspects of their business. As of the end of October, 85% of the annual profit delivery task has been completed, with the export corporations generally completing over 80%, and the China National Import and Export Corporation completing 92% of its annual profit plan.

    To ensure the completion of export tasks, the export corporations have actively adopted many measures in organizing sources of goods, generally going deep into production areas to supervise procurement, effectively strengthening the organization and transfer of sources of goods. For example, the China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation has organized four working groups, dispatched to grassroots points in the production areas of East China, North China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia to supervise procurement. As a result, the daily procurement volume of hogs and fresh eggs has increased significantly, with the daily procurement volume of fresh eggs in North China increasing by more than double. For another example, the China National Animal By-Products Export Corporation dispatched special personnel to the Northwest wool production areas and the Shandong and Hankou areas of goatskin production to supervise procurement and assist in solving transportation problems of Northwest wool. The China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Export Corporation sent personnel to Northeast China, Shandong, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places to assist in solving processing and transportation problems, all of which have achieved certain results.

    Reasonably organizing transportation, increasing technical loading capacity, accelerating commodity turnover, saving transportation costs, and ensuring timely completion of transportation tasks are central to the foreign trade system's completion of this year's fourth-quarter export and import plans. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Trade convened a special study with transportation personnel from various companies, proposing: changing the port of delivery for some export goods; adjusting transportation routes; and adopting methods such as direct sea transportation and coastal water-land combined transportation. The China National Land Transportation Corporation changed the method of allocating imported vehicles directly in Manchuria, saving a large amount of unloading fees, handling fees, and storage fees in the original transfer process. There have also been many new improvements in increasing technical loading capacity. The number of cars shipped from Manchuria has increased from three units in two train cars to eight units in three train cars. Guangzhou and Harbin have implemented cross-loading methods, which have saved 130 million yuan in freight. For another example, the China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation has changed the original method of adding three catties of ice and one catty of salt to refrigerated cars to four catties of ice and one catty of salt, and replaced edible salt with industrial salt, which can save more than 5 billion yuan.

    In terms of exploring potential processing capacity, reducing processing costs, improving product quality, and expanding production volume: For example, the refining rate of Tuocha processed by the Chongqing Tea Factory of the China National Tea Corporation was originally 80%. Through continuous research and improvement by workers, it has been increased to 82% and is guaranteed to be increased to 85% within the year, which can increase production by 150 million yuan. After careful research and calculation by workers, the processing cost of the factory saves one-third of fuel and raw materials, which can save more than 70,000 yuan per dan. The China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation used Qingdao's frozen egg processing equipment to process frozen pork and organized inspections. After solving some technical problems, the daily slaughter and freezing capacity increased by 20% compared to the original. The Tianjin Intestine Casing Processing Factory of the China National Animal By-Products Export Corporation implemented the "Three Fast Working Method" (fast binding, fast measuring, and fast counting), which increased the processing efficiency of pork casings and sheep casings by 30% and 27% respectively. The Tianjin Native Produce Export Corporation's processing of ramie has also increased from the original 84.83 catties of finished product per 100 catties to 86.87 catties.

    Various companies have also made great progress in compressing cash inventory, reducing interest burden, and accelerating capital turnover. The daily cash inventory of the China National Chemicals and Sundries Import Corporation, the China National Machinery Import Corporation, and the China National Technical Import Corporation has been greatly compressed, and the average inventory in October has been reduced by about 80% compared to the third quarter. The China National Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Corporation saved nearly 100 million yuan in interest after compressing the average daily cash inventory in October. The China National Animal By-Products Export Corporation accelerated capital turnover and saved capital by adopting methods such as direct allocation of funds and timely reporting of inventory, and delivered more than 28 billion yuan of surplus working capital in October.

    In addition, some companies have also conducted work quality inspections, improved work systems, consolidated labor discipline, and implemented responsibility systems, which have improved work quality and work efficiency. Through work quality inspections, the China National Machinery Import Corporation can reduce losses by more than 3.4 billion yuan and find a consignee for a blower with an imported value of 1 billion yuan mistakenly ordered in 1951. The China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation promoted a work system of special personnel for special positions and strengthened cooperation between various departments through contact contracts.

    Although the movement to increase production and practice economy in state-owned foreign trade enterprises has achieved initial results, there are still some problems that need to be properly resolved urgently, especially in striving to complete the procurement plan for several key export commodities, and the greatest efforts must be made. The business management of various companies must be further improved. The Ministry of Foreign Trade is prepared to continue to strengthen leadership and inspection, organize the exchange and promotion of experience, and deeply mobilize the masses to ensure the victorious completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy.

    国营对外贸易系统增产节约获得成绩
    完成全年上缴利润任务百分之八十五
    国营对外贸易企业增产节约运动，在各地党委和政府的直接领导下，现已全面展开。各单位均针对着业务上各个重要环节，贯彻增产节约的要求和措施。截至十月底为止，已完成全年上缴利润任务百分之八十五，其中各出口公司一般均已完成百分之八十以上，中国进出口公司已完成全年上缴利润计划百分之九十二。
    为保证出口任务的完成，各出口公司在组织货源上积极地采取了许多措施，一般的均深入产区，督促收购，有效地加强了货源的组织和调运工作。如中国食品出口公司已组织了四个工作组，分赴华东、华北、东北、内蒙等产区基层点督促收购，因而毛猪和鲜蛋的每日收购量显著提高，华北鲜蛋的每日收购量较前增加一倍以上。又如中国畜产公司派遣专人到西北绵羊毛产区及山东和汉口等地山羊板皮产区督促收购，并协助解决西北羊毛运输问题；中国粮谷油脂出口公司派员去东北、山东、天津、汉口等地协助解决加工和运输上的问题，都收到了一定效果。
    合理组织运输，提高技术装载量，加速商品流转，节省运输费用，及时保证运输任务的完成，是对外贸易系统完成今年第四季度出口和进口计划的中心关键之一。对外贸易部为此曾召集各公司运输工作人员作了专门研究，提出了：改变部分出口物资的交货港口；调整运输路线；采用海运直达和沿海水陆联运等办法。中国陆运公司对进口车辆改为在满洲里直接拨运办法，节省了大量的在原来转拨过程中的卸车费、捣运费和栈租费。在提高技术装载量上，也有不少新的改进，满洲里发运汽车已从两个车皮装三台提高到三个车皮装八台，广州、哈尔滨实行了跨装法，已经节省下运费一亿三千万元。又如中国食品出口公司冷藏车原加冰三斤加盐一斤现改为加冰四斤加盐一斤，并将原用食盐改为工业盐，这样就可节约五十亿元以上。
    在发掘加工潜在能力，降低加工费用，提高产品质量并扩大生产量方面。如中国茶业公司重庆茶厂加工沱茶精制率原是百分之八十，经工人不断研究改进，已提高到百分之八十二，并保证在年内提高到百分之八十五，从而可以增产一亿五千万元；该厂加工费经工人细心研究计算，节省燃料及原材料三分之一，计每担可节约七万余元。中国食品出口公司利用青岛冰蛋加工生产设备来加工冻猪肉并组织检查，解决了技术上一些问题后，使每日屠宰冷冻能力比原来提高百分之二十。中国畜产公司天津肠衣加工厂实行“三快工作法”（结捆快、量码快、点数快），使猪肠衣及羊肠衣的加工效率各提高了百分之三十及百分之二十七。天津土产出口公司加工大麻，每百斤原出成品八十四点八三斤，现在也提高到八十六点八七斤了。
    各公司在压缩现金库存，减少利息负担，加速资金周转上也有很大进步。中国化工杂品进口公司、中国机械进口公司与中国技术进口公司每日现金库存均已大大压缩，十月份的平均库存均比第三季度减少了百分之八十左右。中国五金电工进口公司十月份的每日平均现金库存经压缩后，节省利息将近一亿元，中国畜产公司由于采取了资金直接下拨和及时报告库存等办法，加速了资金周转，节省了资金，十月份即上缴了多余的流动资金二百八十余亿元。
    此外，有的公司并进行了工作质量的检查，改进工作制度，巩固劳动纪律，贯彻责任制等工作，工作质量和工作效率都因此有所提高。中国机械进口公司通过工作质量检查，即可减少损失三十四亿多元，并给积压已久的一九五一年错订进口价值十亿元的鼓风机，找到承受的货主。中国食品出口公司推行专人专职的工作制度，并通过联系合同加强了各科室间的合作。
    国营对外贸易企业的增产节约运动虽已取得初步成果，但还存在若干问题急待妥善解决，特别是在争取完成若干重点出口商品收购计划时，还必须作最大努力，各公司企业经营管理还必须进一步改善。对外贸易部准备继续加强领导与检查，组织经验的交流和推广，并深入发动群众，以保证增产节约任务的胜利完成。
