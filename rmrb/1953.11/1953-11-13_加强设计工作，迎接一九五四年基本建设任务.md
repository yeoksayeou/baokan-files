Strengthening Design Work to Meet the Basic Construction Tasks of 1954
    Yuan Ye
    Design work is a crucial link in industrial construction; the state's construction plans must be specifically embodied through design. Therefore, whether design can be completed on time is key to whether the basic construction plan can be completed on schedule. Design work, however, is currently the weakest link in our basic construction effort. Many basic construction projects this year could not be included in the plan or could not be completed on time, mainly because the design work could not keep up.
    At present, the designs for various projects scheduled to begin construction in 1953 have been largely completed; the 1954 construction plan has been initially drafted. During this period, in addition to seizing the time to summarize the key projects designed in 1953 and criticizing the erroneous bourgeois design thinking while establishing correct socialist design thinking, all design institutions must actively carry out the following important tasks to fully utilize existing design capabilities, improve the current design work situation, and prepare in a planned way to meet the basic construction tasks of 1954.
    The first task is to adjust the organization and establish a preliminary responsibility system.
    The prerequisite for doing good design work is to cultivate a large number of technical cadres. To achieve this goal, existing design personnel must be used in a concentrated manner, and design institutions must be adjusted according to the principle of professional division of labor so that all design personnel can master a specialized technology in a short period of time.
    The organizational adjustment should emulate the advanced experience of the Soviet Union: In addition to the administrative management sections such as personnel and planning, the technical business section should be divided into two types: main body design section and auxiliary design section. The main body design section is responsible for production technology design, and its specific division of labor varies according to the nature of each design institution. For example, the main body design section of the Black Metallurgical Design Company should be divided into mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and coking sections. The auxiliary design section is responsible for the design of civil engineering and public systems, including power supply, water supply and drainage, ventilation, heating, and instrument automatic devices. At present, the strengths of various design units are mostly unbalanced, mainly because the auxiliary design section is weak. According to rough calculations, the ratio of main body designers to auxiliary designers should be one to three or four, but most design units currently do not meet this ratio. The solution to this problem, in addition to waiting for various industrial schools to strengthen the training of cadres in this area and for the design departments to hold training courses to accelerate training, should also pay special attention to this issue when adjusting the organization, and try as much as possible to persuade some designers to make appropriate career changes according to national needs.
    After the design organization is adjusted, a corresponding responsibility system must be established in a short period of time to ensure the completion of tasks. At present, the following three most important responsibility systems should be established as soon as possible. The first is the administrative responsibility system. The purpose is to clarify the tasks and responsibilities of managers, section chiefs, team leaders, and chief engineers in the design organization, so that they have a clear division of labor and are responsible at all levels. In particular, a chief engineer system should be established first, so that each engineering design has a dedicated person responsible for technical guidance and organization, and for checking the progress of the design work. The second is the technical responsibility system. From drawing, revising drawings to reviewing, proofreading..., each procedure should have strict responsibility systems to ensure design quality and reduce errors. The third is the liaison system between design sections. The purpose is to ensure that the sections submit technical conditions to each other on time so that the design can proceed according to plan.
    In addition, a technical meeting system must also be established within the design organization to review and discuss the basic plan of each engineering design. This can give full play to the collective wisdom of the designers and avoid fundamental errors in the design.
    The second important task in design management is to prepare a design plan.
    Now, the project items for 1954 have been initially determined, and the design work of various departments has begun. In order to specifically grasp the progress of the design work, a design work plan must be prepared according to the workload and existing design capabilities, so as to be able to carry out the work according to the plan. However, due to the complexity of the design work, the current methods used by various design units to prepare design plans cannot completely grasp the progress of the work. Therefore, after adjusting the organization and initially establishing the responsibility system, it is necessary to gradually promote new methods of preparing design plans in the design department according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that the work of the design department can also be carried out in a planned manner.
    This new method of preparing design plans has been piloted this year by the Anshan Iron and Steel Black Metallurgical Design Company under the guidance of Soviet experts. They mobilized all the designers to formulate a design plan schedule for the whole year based on the state's basic construction plan; based on the annual plan and the estimated design workload based on the number of drawings, they separately formulated the annual design progress plan and monthly work plan for each design section; they also prepared an instruction chart for each unit engineering design to determine the specific dates for each section to submit design conditions to each other (which is actually the contact contract between the design sections); the estimated design workload required for the preparation of preliminary designs, technical designs, and construction drawings were also prepared separately. Through these seven tables, all the design work can be controlled. The experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Black Metallurgical Design Company proves that design work can be carried out according to plan. And only by doing so can the leadership initially have a clear understanding of the situation, be able to grasp the situation and reasons for whether the design can be completed, and gain experience from it or take timely measures to solve the problem.
    Of course, various units will inevitably encounter many difficulties in implementing this new design plan. The first is the difficulty in estimating the workload. Due to the lack of experience of our technical personnel, many new projects are being carried out for the first time, so the workload cannot be estimated very accurately. During the design process, a lot of new workload is often added temporarily due to the wrong estimation of the original workload, so that the work cannot be completed according to plan. In addition, the lack of design data often forces the plan to be disrupted. Therefore, to do a good job in design planning according to the new method, it must go through a period of time, after the designers are more proficient in their work, initially figure out the quotas for design work, and establish various responsibility systems, before it can gradually get on the right track. However, this does not mean waiting for the conditions to be met before carrying out this work, but actively creating conditions, starting from now, organizing technical personnel to study and try to formulate new design plans to gain experience and lay the foundation for formal implementation in the future.
    The third important task in design management is to accumulate design data and improve the design level.
    Design data is the foundation of design work. There must be sufficient, correct, and advanced design data for reference in order to make complete and advanced designs. Design data can be roughly divided into two types: technical data and basic data. Technical data includes production technology operating procedures, various economic and technical indicators, equipment data, and various standard designs. We should first plan to accumulate and translate new Soviet technical books and design documents; at the same time, the new technical creations and rationalization proposals obtained by the workers of various domestic factories and mines over the years, and the new achievements obtained by scientific institutions, should also be planned to be accumulated and applied to the design in order to improve the design level.
    In addition, before starting to design a factory or mine, in order to understand the objective conditions of the design object, it is necessary to measure the site and conduct engineering geological surveys; collect basic design data such as local economic conditions, water and electricity supply, raw material supply, and transportation. Only in this way can we avoid subjectivist errors in design.
    To do a good job in accumulating design data, it is necessary to establish a specialized organization and formulate certain systems. At the same time, we must focus on collecting the main data and oppose the tendency of "wanting everything" without purpose and without boundaries. All kinds of data must be strictly managed, especially confidential national technical data should be given special attention.
    The fourth important task in design management is to prepare a design budget.
    "The design budget is a technical document that must be included in the design book, and preparing the design budget is the inherent work of the designers." This new concept must be established among all designers. After completing the design of a part of the project, each designer should compile the budget for this part of the project according to the budget quota, and then the budget section will review and summarize it to compile the overall budget for the entire enterprise. Only in this way can the designers know whether the project they designed is wasteful or economical, and thus decide on ways to improve the design; the construction department will have the indicators for preparing the construction budget and carrying out production increase and economy, and the basis for signing the contracting contract; and the national financial department will only be able to correctly allocate investment and carry out financial supervision based on the design budget.
    Before preparing the design budget, a series of preparatory work must be carried out. For example, formulate budget and budget quotas, establish a budget section within the design organization, learn budget preparation methods, etc. Therefore, all design institutions that have already started preparing design budgets this year and have the objective conditions for preparing budgets should formally prepare design budgets from 1954. Units that have not prepared budgets this year should immediately start preparing work and cultivate cadres in this area, so as to start piloting the preparation in 1954.
    To do this work well, the relevant leaders must give full attention and support, and should never regard the preparation of the design budget as purely financial work, nor should they think that allocating a part of the technical personnel to prepare the budget is a "waste." All designers must understand the importance of the design budget. Because the advancement and backwardness, waste and economy of the design can be expressed by the design budget. Through this work, the designers can strengthen the economic accounting point of view. At the same time, it should be recognized that the preparation of the budget is an indispensable part of the design work. Only after the budget is completed can it be regarded as the completion of the design of a project.
   The above work is very heavy. However, in order to make our design work keep up with the needs of national construction, we must do so. Moreover, as long as the leading cadres are determined and fully mobilize the designers, we will surely be able to do it.

    加强设计工作，迎接一九五四年基本建设任务
    袁野
    设计工作是工业建设中的重要环节，国家的建设计划必须通过设计才能具体地体现出来。因此，设计能否及时完成，乃是基本建设计划能否按期完成的关键。而设计工作，恰恰是目前我们基本建设工作中最薄弱的一环，今年有许多基本建设工程不能列入计划或不能按时完成，主要原因就是因为设计赶不上。
    现在，预定一九五三年施工的各项工程设计大体上都已完成了；一九五四年的建设计划已初步拟定。在此时期中，各个设计机构除应抓紧时间总结一九五三年设计的重点工程，批判错误的资产阶级的设计思想，树立正确的社会主义设计思想以外，还必须积极进行下列几项重要工作，以充分发挥现有的设计力量，改善目前的设计工作状况，有计划有准备地迎接一九五四年的基本建设任务。
    第一件工作是调整机构，初步建立责任制度。
    做好设计工作的先决条件是必须培养出大批的技术干部。为达到这个目的，就必须将现有的设计人员集中使用，将设计机构按专业分工的原则加以调整，使各个设计人员能在短期内掌握一种专门的技术。
    机构的调整，应该仿效苏联的先进经验：除行政管理部分的人事、计划等科外，技术业务部分应分为主体设计科与辅助设计科两种。主体设计科负责进行生产技术方面的设计，其具体分工则按各设计机构的性质不同而有所区别。例如黑色冶金设计公司的主体设计科就应分为采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、炼焦等科。辅助设计科负责编制土木建筑和公用系统方面的设计，包括供电、供水排水、通风、采暖、计器自动装置等科。目前各设计单位的力量大多数是不平衡的，主要是辅助设计科力量薄弱。据大略的计算，主体设计人员与辅助设计人员的比例应为一与三到四之比，但目前各设计单位均达不到这样的比例。这个问题的解决，除有待于各个工业学校加强培养这方面的干部和由设计部门举办训练班加速训练之外，在调整机构时也应特别注意这个问题，尽可能地说服某些设计人员按照国家需要作适当的转业。
    在设计机构调整以后，必须在一个短的时间内建立相应的责任制度，以保证任务之完成。目前应该尽先建立以下三项最主要的责任制度。第一项是行政责任制。其目的是划清设计机构中经理、科长、组长和工程总负责人的任务与职责范围，使其有明确分工，层层负责。尤其是应该先建立工程总负责人的制度，使每一个工程设计都有一个专人负责技术上的指导和组织、检查设计工作的进行。第二是技术责任制度。从制图、改图到审核、校对……，每一个程序都要规定严格的责任制度，以保证设计质量，减少错误。第三是各设计科间的联系制度。其目的是保证各科按时互相交给技术条件，使设计能按计划进行。
    此外，在设计机构内还必须建立技术会议制度，审查讨论各工程设计的基本方案。这样，可以充分发挥设计人员集体的智慧，并可避免设计中原则性的错误。
    设计管理上的第二项重要工作是编制设计计划。
    现在一九五四年的工程项目已初步确定，各部门的设计工作已开始进行。为了能具体掌握设计工作的进度，必须按工作量与现有设计力量编制出设计工作的计划，以期能按计划进行工作。但由于设计工作的复杂性，目前各设计单位编制设计计划的方法已不能完全掌握工作的进度。因此，在调整了机构并初步建立了责任制度之后，必须根据苏联先进经验，逐步地在设计部门中推行新的编制设计计划的方法，以期使设计部门的工作也能有计划地进行。
    这种新的编制设计计划的方法，今年鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司在苏联专家的指导下已经试行。他们发动全体设计人员，根据国家的基本建设计划，制订了全年的设计计划进度表；根据全年的计划和按照图纸张数估计的设计工作量，分别制订了各设计科的全年设计进度计划表和每月工作计划表；还编制了每一个单位工程设计的指示图表，确定各科相互提出设计条件的具体日期（实际上也即是各设计科间的联系合同）；对编制初步设计、技术设计和施工图时所需设计工作量也都分别作出了估计表。通过这七张表，全部的设计工作都可以被控制住了。鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司的经验证明：设计工作是可以按照计划进行的。而且只有这样做了，领导上才能初步做到心中有数，能够掌握设计能否完成的情况及原因，从中取得经验或及时采取措施加以解决。
    当然，各单位要实行这种新的设计计划，必然会遇到许多困难，首先就是估计工作量的困难。由于我们的技术人员经验不足，很多新的工程都是首次进行，所以工作量不能估计得十分准确，在设计过程中，常常由于原来工作量估错而临时增加很多新的工作量，以致工作不能按计划完成。此外，由于缺乏设计资料，也往往使计划被迫打乱。因此，要按照新的方法做好设计计划，必须经过一段时间，在设计人员工作已比较熟练，初步摸到了设计工作的定额，并建立了各种责任制度后，才能逐步走上正轨。但是，这并不是说要等待条件具备后才进行这一工作，而是要积极地创造条件，从现在起就开始组织技术人员进行学习，并试行制订新的设计计划，以取得经验，为将来正式实行打下基础。
    设计管理上的第三项重要工作是积累设计资料，提高设计水平。
    设计资料是设计工作的基础，必须有足够的、正确的、先进的设计资料供作参考，才能做出完整的先进的设计来。设计资料大体上可分为技术资料与基础资料二种。技术资料包括生产技术操作过程、各种经济技术指标、设备资料以及各种标准设计等。我们首先应有计划地积累和翻译新的苏联技术书籍及设计文件；同时对国内各生产厂矿职工几年来所获得新的技术上的创造及合理化建议，科学机关所获得的新的成就，也都应有计划的加以积累，应用到设计之中，以期提高设计水平。
    此外在动手设计一个厂矿之前，为了了解设计对象的客观条件，必须对厂址进行测量和工程地质勘查工作；收集当地经济条件、水电供应、原料供给以及交通运输等设计基础资料。只有这样，才能避免设计上主观主义的错误。
    要做好积累设计资料的工作，必须建立专门的机构，制订一定的制度。同时，必须着重搜集主要的资料，反对无目的地、茫无边际地“无所不要”的偏向。对各种资料，必须严加管理，尤其对于国家机密的技术资料，更应特别注意。
    设计管理上的第四项重要工作是编制设计预算。
    “设计预算是设计书中必须具备的技术文件，编制设计预算是设计人员分内的工作。”这个新的概念必须在全体设计人员中树立起来。各设计人员在完成某一部分工程的设计后，即应根据预算定额编出这一部分工程的预算，然后再由预算科审查汇总，编成全企业的总预算。只有这样，设计人员才能知道他所设计的工程是浪费还是节约，从而决定改进这个设计的办法；施工部门才有了编制施工预算和进行增产节约的指标，有了签订包工合同的根据；而国家财政部门也只有根据设计预算，才能正确地拨付投资和进行财务监督。
    在编制设计预算之前，必须进行一系列的准备工作。例如制定概算和预算定额，在设计机构内成立预算科，学习预算编制方法等。因此，凡是在今年已经开始编制设计预算，已具备编制预算的客观条件的设计机构，均应从一九五四年起正式编制设计预算。今年没有编制过预算的单位，则应立即着手进行准备工作，并培养这方面的干部，以求得在一九五四年开始试行编制。
    要做好这件工作，各有关的领导干部必须给以充分的重视和支持，绝不应把编制设计预算认为是单纯的财务工作，也不应认为调配一部分技术人员去编制预算是“浪费”。所有的设计人员都必须了解设计预算的重要意义。因为设计的先进与落后、浪费与节约，都可由设计预算表现出来，通过这一工作，可以使设计人员加强经济核算的观点。同时应该认识到编制预算是设计工作中不可缺少的部分，只有把预算编完之后，才能算是完成了一个工程的设计。
   上述工作是十分繁重的。但是，为了使我们的设计工作赶上国家建设的需要，我们就必须这样做。而且，只要领导干部下定决心，把设计人员充分发动起来，我们也一定能够做到的。
