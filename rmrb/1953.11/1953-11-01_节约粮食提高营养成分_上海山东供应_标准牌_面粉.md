    Conserve Grain, Improve Nutritional Content
    Shanghai and Shandong Supply "Standard Brand" Flour

    In order to increase the flour extraction rate of wheat and conserve grain, the grain departments of Shanghai and Shandong have begun to supply "Standard Brand" flour. In the past, the "Fuqiang Brand" and "Jianshe Brand" flour supplied to the market by state-owned grain departments were of higher quality and precision, resulting in the loss of nutritional components of the grain. In order to conserve grain, the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau conducted a trial milling operation in Jinan to appropriately reduce the precision of flour. After successful trial production, the new flour was named "Standard Brand" flour, and the grain departments of Shandong and Shanghai have successively begun selling "Standard Brand" flour.

    According to the new specifications, the flour extraction rate per 100 catties of wheat is, on average, 4.82 catties higher than that of the original "Jianshe Brand" flour. Based on Shandong Province's annual processing task alone, 33.17 million catties of wheat can be saved annually. "Standard Brand" flour has excellent nutritional content. On the 23rd, the Shanghai State-Owned Grain Company’s wholesale price was 72,000 yuan per bag, which is 9,000 yuan lower than the original "Fuqiang Brand" per bag and 3,500 yuan lower than the original "Jianshe Brand" per bag.

    节约粮食提高营养成分
    上海山东供应“标准牌”面粉
    上海及山东粮食部门为提高小麦出粉率、节约粮食，开始供应“标准牌”面粉。过去国营粮食部门供应市场的“富强牌”“建设牌”面粉，质量精度较高，粮食的营养成分受到损耗。为了节约粮食，山东省粮食厅曾在济南进行适当降低面粉精度的试磨工作。现经试制成功，新粉定名为“标准牌”面粉，山东及上海市粮食部门已先后开始出售“标准牌”面粉。
    按照新规格，每百斤小麦的出粉率平均较原来的“建设牌”面粉提高四点八二斤。仅照山东省全年加工任务计算，每年即可节省小麦三千三百十七万斤。“标准牌”面粉营养成分很好，上海市国营粮食公司二十三日挂牌批发价每袋七万二千元，较原“富强牌”每袋低九千元，较原“建设牌”每袋低三千五百元。　（程华）
