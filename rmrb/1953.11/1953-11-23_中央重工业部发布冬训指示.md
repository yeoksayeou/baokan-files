The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry recently issued "Instructions on Conducting Winter Training Work in Construction and Installation Enterprises." The instructions pointed out: Utilizing the winter season to conduct winter training in construction and installation enterprises is one of the effective methods for construction departments to strengthen their construction forces and improve their technical and professional levels. In addition to universally improving the existing permanent workers politically and technically, special attention should be paid to the training of grassroots cadres (site directors, foremen, team leaders), technical personnel, and the necessary specialized tradesmen to achieve the goal of universally improving construction management and technical levels, which should become the main task of winter training work in construction and installation enterprises.

To ensure the smooth progress of this work, the instructions required: 1. First, train the enterprise's grassroots cadres, which is one of the main targets of this year's winter training. The Ministry of Heavy Industry will run a basic construction cadre school to specifically train site directors in batches. At the same time, each bureau (company) is instructed to run foreman training classes, actively cultivating and training grassroots management cadres in construction enterprises. In addition to political study, the basic content of business learning in foreman training classes should be: the foreman responsibility system, construction operation methods, quality standards, map reading and surveying, "engineering task sheets," and general knowledge of work plans and safety technology regulations. 2. Organize technical personnel to study. In addition to being responsible for giving technical lectures to workers, technical personnel should systematically and lead study political and business knowledge. In terms of political study, they should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, systematically study the Party's general line to further enhance the political awareness and work responsibility of the broad masses of technical cadres. Business learning should further improve technical level through summarizing work. 3. Actively cultivate skilled workers needed for specialized trades such as machinery, electrical, steel structure, and assembly, especially the most lacking riveters, scaffolders, electrical adjusters, various construction machinery drivers, and other specialized tradesmen. 4. Improve the political and technical levels of existing permanent workers. Determine the proportion of political and technical business learning according to the different historical development of each construction and installation enterprise. For newly established engineering companies this year, the proportion of political education should be appropriately increased; for engineering companies with a certain management foundation and whose permanent workers have received a certain amount of political education, the proportion of technical education should be increased this year. As for political study materials, they should be requested from the local Party committee for assistance. Technical business learning should be conducted according to different technical levels, including education on construction methods, quality standards, labor organization, map reading, and general technical principles. This will gradually solve the serious imbalance between various trades in construction operations.

The instructions pointed out: To do a good job in winter training, attention must also be paid to the following issues: 1. The main leading comrades of each construction and installation enterprise must personally be responsible for this work. Before entering winter training, the deployment of construction organization must be considered in accordance with the different construction tasks and locations of each construction enterprise next year. Experience proves that only by doing this can winter training work be done well and can certain results be achieved. 2. To do a good job in winter training, it is necessary to immediately make preparations for determining winter training instructors and fully studying teaching. 3. Regarding the winter training time, each unit can determine it specifically according to local climate conditions, the completion date of the project, and the starting date of next year's work, etc. Generally, the winter training time of two to three months is the most appropriate. The instructions finally required each bureau (company) to quickly deploy this work in accordance with the above spirit.

    中央重工业部发布冬训指示
    中央重工业部最近发出“关于建筑安装企业进行冬训工作的指示”。指示指出：建筑安装企业利用冬季进行冬训，是基本建设施工部门壮大施工力量、提高技术水平与业务水平的有效方法之一。除将现有固定工人在政治上、技术上普遍提高一步外，应特别注意基层干部（工地主任、工长、班组长）、技术人员以及所需的各特殊工种工人的培养训练工作，以达到普遍提高施工管理与技术水平的目的，这应成为建筑安装企业进行冬训工作的主要任务。
    为了保证这一工作能够顺利进行，指示要求：一、首先要训练企业基层干部，这是今年冬训主要对象之一。重工业部将举办基本建设干部学校，专门分批调训工地主任。同时并责成各局（公司）举办工长训练班，积极培养和训练施工企业中的基层管理干部。工长训练班除了政治学习外，业务学习的基本内容应该是：工长责任制、施工操作法、质量标准、识图与放样放线、“工程任务单”以及作业计划的一般知识与安全技术规程等。二、组织技术人员学习。技术人员除了负有向工人进行技术授课的任务外，应有组织有领导地学习政治与业务知识。在政治学习方面，应该在当地党委领导下，系统地学好党的总路线，进一步提高广大技术干部的政治觉悟与工作责任感。业务学习应通过总结工作的方式，进一步提高技术水平。三、积极培养机械、电气与钢筋结构、装配等特殊工种所需要的熟练工人，特别是目前最缺少的铆焊工、架工、电气调整工、各种施工机械驾驶工以及其他一些特殊工种工人。四、提高现有固定工人的政治水平与技术水平。根据各个建筑安装企业不同的历史发展情况，确定政治与技术业务学习的比重。凡今年新成立的工程公司，政治教育的比重应适当增大；有了一定管理基础的工程公司，固定工人曾受过一定政治教育的，今年则应加大技术教育的比重。至于政治学习的教材，应请示当地党委帮助解决。技术业务学习，应分别不同技术水平，进行有关施工法、质量标准、劳动组织、识图以及一般技术原理等教育。这样就可以逐渐解决施工作业中所发生的各工种之间严重的不平衡状况。
    指示指出：作好冬训工作，还必须注意下列几个问题：一、各建筑安装企业的主要领导同志必须亲自负责此项工作。在进入冬训前，必须按照各施工企业明年不同的施工任务及施工所在地，通盘考虑施工组织上的部署。经验证明只有这样作，才能作好冬训工作，也才能收到一定的效果。二、作好冬训工作，必须立即作好确定冬训教员并充分研究教学等准备工作。三、关于冬训时间，各单位可根据当地的气候条件，工程结束日期与明年开工日期等条件具体确定，一般冬训时间以两个月至三个月为最适宜。指示最后要求各局（公司）应根据上述精神，迅速布置此项工作。
