    Leading Comrades of Local Party Committees Take the Lead Personally
    National General Line Propaganda Widely Unfolded
    [This Newspaper's News] The propaganda and education work concerning the general line of the state during the transition period has been widely launched in various regions. This newspaper has successively reported that East China, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest Administrative Committees have respectively conducted transmission and discussions, cadres of directly affiliated organs of the Central People's Government, Northeast first-level organs, and first-level organs of Shenyang City have actively started studying, and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission has assigned the study of the general line to all officers and soldiers. Currently, responsible comrades of the local CCP committees are personally taking the lead, directly guiding this propaganda and education work.
    In East China, propaganda and education work on the Party's general line and general task during the transition period has been widely unfolded. Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, personally went to Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang provinces, as well as Shanghai and Songjiang County, to give reports to cadres on "The General Line and General Task during the Transition Period." The report meeting held in Shanghai lasted for four and a half days, presided over by Comrades Chen Yi, Chen Pixian, and Pan Hannian, respectively, and Comrade Tan Zhenlin gave a report on "The General Line and General Task during the Transition Period." Comrade Chen Yi also gave instructions on learning methods and points to be noted at the end of the meeting. More than 14,000 cadres from first-level organs in East China and cadres from Shanghai's city, district, and grassroots levels participated in the report meeting. Responsible cadres of the East China Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee have, since November 12, given reports to cadres in various fields such as organs, troops, workers, shop employees, cultural and educational circles, scientific circles, industrial and commercial circles, and neighborhood committees on "The General Line and General Task during the Transition Period." On the 12th, Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, gave a report on "The General Line and General Task during the Transition Period" to more than 14,000 professors, scientists, writers, artists, educators, and other cultural, educational, artistic, medical and health, and news publishing workers in Shanghai's universities and specialized schools. He called on all cultural and educational workers in Shanghai to study and promote the general line of the transition period and contribute the greatest strength to the complete realization of the country's socialist industrialization. Currently, cadres of first-level organs in East China and city and district-level organs in Shanghai, after listening to reports or transmissions, have begun to study the main documents on the general line stipulated by the Central Committee. The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee have decided to assign all report personnel and temporary report personnel of the East China first-level organs and the city and district-level organs in Shanghai, totaling about 3,000 people, to various grassroots units in Shanghai to give reports to the people. The CCP district committees and party committees in Shanghai will also convene demonstrative report meetings, with responsible persons of the district committees and party committees giving demonstrative reports for reference by other report personnel and temporary report personnel. In addition, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee has printed a large number of "Propaganda Outlines" for report personnel and propagandists to use. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized cadres to study the Party's general line during the transition period. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China conveyed the Party's general line during the transition period at an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee held on October 20, and closely combined it with Jiangsu Province's current work tasks to arrange study. Following this, senior group cadres originally participating in theoretical study at the provincial level and at the prefectural and municipal party committee levels, and cadres originally participating in intermediate group studies at the provincial level, universally entered the study of the general line. The CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee also convened an enlarged meeting of all district committee secretaries from October 25 to November 10. Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, gave a comprehensive transmission of the Party's general line during the transition period at this meeting. This meeting achieved great results in promoting cadre study of the general line of the transition period. The cadres attending the meeting clarified the path that should be taken to transition to socialism and arranged future work according to the Party's general line. The CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee also organized rural cadres to visit factories, enabling them to concretely understand the importance of industrialization, and thus have a more correct understanding of the relationship between workers and peasants. After this meeting, all counties will organize all party members to study the Party's general line during the transition period before the end of November, and then widely publicize it to the broad masses of peasants. The industrial and mining propaganda meeting convened by the Propaganda Department of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee also determined to focus on the general line of the transition period as the center of propaganda. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the province's Fourth Party Congress from late October to early November. Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, attended the meeting and gave a report on the general line and general tasks of the transition period. The meeting focused on discussing the Party's general line and general task during the transition period to "gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization over a fairly long period of time, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industrial and commercial sectors." The delegates were greatly educated and encouraged, and unanimously supported the general line. The meeting decided: All cadres inside and outside the Party throughout the province must universally and deeply study the general line and general task of the transition period, and at the same time, extensively promote socialism to the broad masses of the people.
    First-level organs in North China, cadres at or above the county level in various provinces and cities in North China, have, since October, successively heard the transmission reports on the general line of the state during the transition period by the responsible persons of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau and the CCP committees of various provinces and cities. The Hebei Provincial People's Government Committee also discussed the general line. The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau has instructed various localities to require cadres in various localities to seriously study the general line on the basis of studying Chapter Nine of the History of the CPSU(B). The requirement for learning is to clarify the principles of the general line, connect with practical work, and draw a clear line between capitalism and socialism. The economic construction theory study class organized by the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau continues to take the general line as the center, with two months as a term, rotating training for the main responsible cadres in various positions. Party schools in various localities also take the general line as a compulsory course. In order to widely launch the propaganda and education of the general line among the masses, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau is drafting plans and propaganda points for carrying out general line propaganda in industrial and mining enterprises and in rural areas. This winter's branch education work and winter study work will all revolve around the general line. The "North China People" magazine, from the twenty-first issue, will closely combine with the current rural work and compile speech materials on the general line. A more systematic introduction to the growth of Soviet collective farms will also be conducted. The North China People's Publishing House has re-clarified the publication policy around the general line. In addition to focusing on publishing elementary theory, policy explanations, and typical experiences in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, it will vigorously organize propaganda materials on socialist industrialization. North China's art and literary writers have also taken action and are creating pictures to promote the general line and literary and artistic works related to the general line. Cadres in various parts of North China have generally studied Chapter Nine of the History of the CPSU(B), and have a certain degree of understanding of the theory of the path taken during the Soviet transition period. Therefore, when listening to transmission reports on the general line of the state during the transition period, they felt exceptionally close. Many organ cadres reflected in discussions that their eyes were lit up and that they had found an accurate yardstick for measuring the achievements and shortcomings of their work. The third economic construction theory study class sponsored by the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau is based on the general line to study Soviet economic construction theory, so this term has been particularly effective.
    Cadres of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau and various organs in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have begun to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. The CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau issued a "Directive on Cadre Theoretical Study in Guangzhou Organs in November and December" on October 24, requiring cadres participating in the high and intermediate groups of theoretical study in various organs in the city to combine Chapter Nine of the History of the CPSU(B) and some of Lenin and Stalin's works on socialist economic construction in November and December to conduct a systematic and in-depth study of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period and the tasks of the South China party organizations in national planned construction. Subsequently, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau separately convened meetings of the responsible persons of the party committees of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau directly affiliated organs, the CCP Guangzhou Municipal Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the South China Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government, and the Guangzhou Railway Administration, and made specific arrangements. In order to urge the senior group cadres to learn well first, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau conducted a check on the learning situation of the senior group and convened a meeting of the senior group leaders of various organs in Guangzhou on November 4. Tao Zhu, Acting Secretary of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, made an important instruction at the meeting. He said: To implement the Party's general line during the transition period in every task, we must first rely on senior cadres. The so-called "the key lies in leadership" is what it means. He pointed out: First, we must require senior cadres to improve their ideological level in order to carry out ideological work for all cadres. Currently, the senior groups of various organs stationed in Guangzhou have universally conveyed Tao Zhu's instructions, formulated plans, and started reading documents seriously. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Committee and the Consultative Committee jointly held an enlarged joint meeting on November 4, listening to the report by He Wei, Mayor of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, on "The General Line and General Task of the State during the Transition Period." The members of the Municipal People's Government Committee, the members of the Municipal Consultative Committee, and the representatives of various democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, ethnic minorities, and religious circles who were invited to attend the meeting unanimously supported the general line of the state during the transition period. The Hubei Provincial Consultative Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Consultative Committee jointly invited Zhang Zhiyi, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CCP Central Committee Central South Bureau, to give a report on "The General Line and General Task of the State during the Transition Period and the Issue of State Capitalism" on November 3. Attending the meeting were representatives of provincial and municipal local organizations of various democratic parties, scientific and technological workers, members of the municipal and district federations of industry and commerce, representatives of religious organizations, and non-party intermediate-level cadres of government agencies, totaling more than 1,600 people. After explaining the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, Zhang Zhiyi focused on analyzing the issue of how to carry out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. He called on private industrialists and merchants to actively improve business management under the leadership of the government and the state-owned economy, and gradually develop towards the direction of state capitalism.
    The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the province's Second Propaganda Work Conference from October 31 to November 6. Li Jingquan, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhang, Deputy Secretary, and Du Xinyuan, Minister of Propaganda, gave reports at the meeting on the general line of the state during the transition period and how to vigorously promote the general line to the broad masses of the people. The meeting focused on discussing how to vigorously promote the Party's general line during the transition period to peasants, as well as the propaganda issues of the current grain purchase work. The meeting also studied how to implement the propaganda of the Party's general line in cities, factories, and mines.
