The cadre theoretical study in the Taiyuan State-Owned No. 247 Factory, under the concrete leadership of the Party Committee, has gradually improved the study environment, enhanced cadres' interest in learning, and achieved certain results since the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The factory is a model learning unit in Taiyuan City. The factory Party Committee was commended by the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China for its achievements in leading cadre theoretical study.

After studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the factory began studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" (Advanced Group) and "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" (Middle and Elementary Groups) in February of this year. From July of this year, it began studying "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" (Advanced and Middle Groups) and "The Process of Building a Socialist Society in the Soviet Union" (Elementary Group). Currently, 50.7% of the factory's cadres are participating in theoretical study.

The main experience of the factory Party Committee in leading cadre theoretical study is its ability to carry out the organization and ideological leadership of cadre theoretical study by addressing the characteristics of the factory.

I. Improved Organizational Leadership of Cadre Theoretical Study
     Targeting the Characteristics of Factories and Mines

(1) The cadre members of factories and mines are generally more complex than those of government offices, and their ideological awareness and political and theoretical level vary greatly. Among the cadres participating in theoretical study in this factory, 16.5% participated in the revolution before liberation, 15.5% were promoted from workers, 26.3% joined the workforce after liberation, 29.6% worked in the original factory before liberation, and 11.9% were newly employed intellectuals. Among these cadres, 9% are Party member cadres and 91% are non-Party member cadres. These cadres include veteran Party members who participated in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, as well as intellectuals who have not formally studied a single book on political theory in the three years since liberation; there are senior engineering and technical personnel who have studied abroad, as well as worker-peasant cadres with low levels of education. Based on this situation, the Party Committee implemented an examination-based grouping system. Generally, those with less than junior high school education are placed in cultural classes, those with no foundation in political theory are placed in the elementary group, and some engineering and technical personnel and new cadres who are making rapid progress politically and can keep up theoretically are placed in the intermediate group. In order to do a good job of grading and grouping, mobilization and adjustments were carried out repeatedly, and now the grouping has become basically reasonable. Therefore, everyone has a high enthusiasm for learning.

(2) The nature of factory and mine work also brings different characteristics to cadre theoretical study compared to government offices. First, factories are units that use modern large-scale machine production, but the technical level of most cadres lags far behind objective needs, which easily leads to a phenomenon of emphasizing business and technical learning and neglecting theoretical learning. For example, some comrades said: "If you don't learn technology, you won't be able to work, but if you don't learn theory, you can still get by for the time being." The Party Committee paid close attention to this situation. On the one hand, it appropriately arranged the time for theoretical learning and the time for business learning, reducing the theoretical learning time from 10 hours per week to 4 hours per week, and relatively increasing the business learning time. On the other hand, it strengthened guidance on learning, and advocated learning for practical application. Second, work in factories is relatively tense, and therefore, in the past, learning was often delayed due to work. To this end, the Party Committee stipulated a learning system, such as not allowing work to be carried out during learning time except for temporary accidents, and established a sign-in attendance and inspection system. On the other hand, it called on everyone to pre-arrange the things to be done during the morning learning time before getting off work in the afternoon of the previous day, so as to avoid hindering production or delaying learning as much as possible. Experience has proven that this approach can achieve very good results. Now, the general cadres of the factory have initially developed a habit of learning, and there is almost no work being done, or late arrivals and early departures during learning time, nor is there a phenomenon of learning hindering production.

(3) Many of the workshop Party branch secretaries in factories and mines are newly promoted from workers, and their cultural level is not even up to junior high school, and they have no theoretical foundation, which makes it difficult for the branch to lead the theoretical study of cadres. In response to this situation, at the beginning of studying "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," the Party Committee changed the previous organizational form of leading theoretical study of cadres by the branch, and directly led the entire cadre theoretical study, while the branch played a role in guaranteeing and urging the study. The Party Committee first established four guiding study classes—one intermediate group class to guide four groups, and three elementary group classes, each guiding 12 or 13 groups. Each class was headed by a class leader and a deputy class leader, appointed by the Party Committee, all of whom were part-time. These comrades have a high enthusiasm for theoretical study and have the ability and time to undertake the task of guidance. In order to take care of their guiding work, the Party Committee gave them two full days a month (which they could use flexibly) to carry out theoretical study activities. The task of the class was to organize lectures, lead and train group leaders and tutors, grasp the ideological situation and learning problems of students, and report to the Party Committee regularly. Among the four groups in the intermediate group, a core group was established, whose members were primary school teachers and class leaders who participated in the intermediate group study. This group played a role in driving the primary group on the one hand, and guiding the general intermediate group on the other. The task of the group was to correct the learning attitude at any time, adhere to the system, grasp the key points of learning, and hold discussions well. Below the class level, a tutor was set up for every two groups, nominated by everyone and formally hired after research by the Party Committee. According to regulations, tutors do not participate in other activities during the spare time on Fridays and Saturdays in order to learn a step ahead. The task of the tutor is to explain some necessary nouns and terms, help understand the content of the lectures, and introduce learning methods, experience, etc. This organizational form can help the branch overcome the difficulty of not being able to lead theoretical study, and can help the Party Committee to completely lead the theoretical study through it.

II. Strengthening Ideological Leadership of Cadre Study

(1) Carrying out widespread and in-depth mobilization from top to bottom, targeting the actual ideological situation, and repeatedly explaining the requirements and purpose of learning are the primary tasks at the beginning of learning. When studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the factory, in accordance with the spirit of the mobilization report of the Municipal Party Committee and combined with the actual situation of the factory, Comrade Cheng Shengyu, deputy secretary of the Party Committee, made a mobilization. The ideological situation of various types of cadres was investigated in advance, and different requirements were put forward according to this situation. For example, when studying the international situation, veteran cadres mainly learned from the two different paths of economic development and the emergence of two parallel markets to understand the new characteristics of the current international situation; new cadres mainly clarified from the essence which side of the two major camps had greater strength; engineering and technical personnel mainly recognized the great significance of the strength and development of the Soviet Union to the world proletarian revolutionary struggle, so as to further establish the idea of ​​learning from the Soviet Union. This gave everyone a clear understanding of the purpose of learning, and felt that learning had a way and could solve problems.

(2) Formulating a specific schedule, suggesting key points of chapters, strengthening the planning of learning, and appropriately grasping universal and fundamental issues to conduct classroom discussions, inspire free thinking, carry out free debates, and then concentrate the masses' thoughts for summary to understand the main problems in learning. When studying "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," the factory issued a "curriculum" according to the learning unit under the general learning plan. The "curriculum" includes a specific schedule, time arrangements for lectures and discussions, key points of learning, review discussion questions, and reference documents. In this way, because the group and individuals understand the learning process in advance, the phenomenon of delaying learning due to temporarily requesting instructions from the Party Committee no longer occurs. When studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the factory also held discussions around four highly controversial issues. After each group discussed, it selected its own representatives to speak at the general discussion meeting. After the discussion, the comrades of the Party Committee made a comprehensive speech, and then let everyone return to the group for further discussion, and finally Comrade Cheng Shengyu, deputy secretary of the Party Committee, made a summary. Everyone was very satisfied with such a discussion.

(3) Review and summarize gains, conduct comprehensive tests, and democratically grade papers to achieve a beginning and an end. When the study of "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" came to an end, Comrade Cheng Shengyu reported on how to review and summarize gains, and everyone found the way, knowing where to start. The process of testing and democratic grading is also a process of reviewing problems and summarizing gains, and everyone is very nervous. After summarizing from individuals to groups, the Party Committee then summarizes, and through the summary, lays a good foundation for the next stage of learning.

    太原国营二四七厂党委对干部理论学习的领导
    时寿之
    太原国营二四七厂的干部理论学习，在党委具体领导下，从学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会的文件以来，逐步地健全了学习生活，提高了干部的学习兴趣，并获得了一定成绩。该厂是太原市的模范学习单位。该厂党委因在领导干部理论学习方面获得成绩，曾受到中共太原市委的表扬。
    该厂在学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会的文件之后，从今年二月起，即开始了“苏联社会主义经济问题”（高级组）和“中国共产党的三十年”
  （中、初级组）的学习；从今年七月起，又开始了
  “联共（布）党史”（高、中级组）和“苏联建成社会主义社会的经过”（初级组）的学习。现在，全厂有百分之五十点七的干部都参加理论学习。
    该厂党委领导干部理论学习的主要经验是：善于针对厂矿的特点，来进行干部理论学习的组织领导和思想领导。
    一、针对厂矿特点，改进了干部理论
        学习的组织领导
    （一）厂矿的干部一般比机关的干部成员复杂，思想觉悟和政治理论水平也极悬殊。该厂在参加理论学习的干部中，解放前参加革命的占百分之十六点五，工人提拔起来的占百分之十五点五，解放后参加工作的占百分之二十六点三，解放前在原厂工作的占百分之二十九点六，新参加工作的知识分子占百分之十一点九。其中党员干部占百分之九，非党员干部占百分之九十一。这些干部中有参加过第二次国内革命战争的党员老干部，也有解放后三年来没正式学过一本政治理论书的知识分子；有留过学的高级工程技术人员，也有文化水平很低的工农干部。根据这种情况，党委实行了考试编组制度。一般是把不够初中文化水平的编入文化班，把政治理论上没有基础的编入初级组，把部分政治上进步较快、理论上可以跟上的工程技术人员和新干部编入中级组。为了认真地做好编级工作，一再进行了动员和调整，现在编组已做到基本上合理。因此，大家学习情绪很高。
    （二）厂矿工作业务的性质，也给干部理论学习带来了与机关不同的特点。第一，工厂是使用现代化大机器生产的单位，而一般干部的技术水平却大大地落后于客观需要，因此就容易产生重视业务技术学习、忽视理论学习的现象。例如有的同志说：“不学技术将不能进行工作，不学理论暂且还可过下去。”党委十分注意这种情况，一方面，适当地安排了理论学习时间和业务学习时间，将理论学习时间从过去的每周十小时缩减到每周四小时，而将业务学习时间相对地增加；另一方面，加强对学习的指导，提倡学以致用。第二，工厂中工作比较紧张，因而，过去常有因工作耽误了学习的现象。为此，党委一方面规定了学习制度，如在学习时间，除临时性的事故外，一般不得进行工作，并建立了签到考勤和检查制度；另一方面，号召大家把早晨学习时间要做的事情，在前一天下午下班前就预先安排，尽可能做到既不妨碍生产，也不耽误学习。经验证明，这样的做法是可以收到很好的效果的。现在该厂一般干部都已初步养成了学习习惯，几乎没有在学习时间工作或迟到早退，也没有因学习妨碍生产的现象。
    （三）厂矿的车间支部书记，不少是新从工人中提拔起来的，文化水平还不够初中程度，理论上也没有基础，这就使支部领导干部的理论学习发生困难。党委针对这个情况，在学习“联共（布）党史”的开始时，改变了以往由支部领导干部理论学习的组织形式，而由党委来直接领导整个干部理论学习，支部在学习中起保证和督促作用。党委首先建立了四个指导学习班——中级组一个班，指导四个小组；初级组三个班，各指导十二、三个小组。每班设班长、副班长各一人，由党委指派，都是兼职。这些同志对理论学习热情很高，并有能力和时间来担负指导任务。党委为了照顾他们的指导工作，每月给予两整天的时间（自己可以灵活使用）专门进行理论学习的活动。班的任务是组织听讲，领导和培养小组长、辅导员，掌握学员的思想情况和学习问题，经常向党委汇报。中级组四个小组中，成立一个核心小组，其成员是参加中级组学习的初级组教员和班长等人，这个小组一方面起带动初级组的作用，一方面起指导一般中级组的作用。小组的任务是随时端正学习态度，坚持制度，掌握学习重点，开好讨论会。班以下每两个小组设一个辅导员，由大家提名，经党委研究后正式聘请。按照规定，辅导员在每星期五、六的业余活动时间不参加其他活动，以做到先学一步。辅导员的任务是解释一些必要的名词术语，帮助领会讲课内容，介绍学习方法、经验等。这样的组织形式，可以帮助支部克服不能领导理论学习的困难，并可以帮助党委通过它把理论学习完全领导起来。
    二、加强对干部学习的思想领导
    （一）自上而下地广泛而深入地进行动员，对准思想实际情况，反复阐明学习的要求和目的，是学习开始时的首要工作。在学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会文件时，该厂根据市委动员报告的精神，结合本厂实际，由党委副书记成生瑜同志作了动员。事先调查了各种类型干部的思想情况，针对这种情况提出了不同要求。如学国际形势时，老干部主要从两种不同的经济发展道路和两个平行市场的出现去认识当前国际形势的新特点；新干部主要是从本质上弄清两大阵营究竟谁的力量大；工程技术人员则是认识苏联的强大和发展对世界无产阶级革命斗争的重大意义，从而进一步树立学习苏联的思想。这就使每个人对学习目的有了明确认识，感觉到学习有门路、能够解决问题。
    （二）拟订具体进度，提示章节重点，加强学习的计划性，并适时地抓住带有普遍性、根本性的问题，进行课堂讨论，启发自由思想，开展自由论辩，然后集中群众的思想进行总结，搞通学习中主要问题。在学习“中国共产党的三十年”的时候，该厂在总的学习计划下，按照学习单元制发“课程表”。“课程表”包括具体进度、讲课讨论的时间安排、学习重点、复习讨论题和参考文件。这样，由于小组和个人预先了解学习程序，以往因临时请示党委而耽误学习的现象就不再发生了。学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会文件时，该厂还曾环绕四个争执很多的问题展开讨论。各小组讨论后，选出自己的代表在大讨论会上发言。讨论后，由党委的同志做了综合发言，然后让大家回到小组再进行讨论，最后由党委副书记成生瑜同志做总结。大家对这样的讨论很满意。
    （三）复习和总结收获，进行全面测验，民主评卷，做到有始有终。当“中国共产党的三十年”学习结束之际，成生瑜同志把如何进行复习和总结收获作了报告，大家摸着了门径，知道从那些方面着手。测验和民主评卷的过程，也就是复习问题总结收获的过程，大家情绪很紧张。从个人到小组总结之后，然后再由党委总结，并通过总结给下一阶段的学习打下了良好基础。
