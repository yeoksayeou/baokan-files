Currently, the explanation work being carried out by the Korean and Chinese sides for the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, is being met with intensified obstruction and sabotage by the U.S. side. This has led to an extremely serious continuous standstill and interruption. In the nineteen days since the explanation work began on October 15th, our side has only conducted a total of fifteen hours, which is less than two days of explanation time. This U.S. side's behavior of disregarding and undermining the scope of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's authority, and rudely preventing the repatriation of prisoners of war, has clearly posed a major threat to the Korean Armistice Agreement. To this end, our side's representative lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side at the Korean Military Armistice Commission on October 31st, and warned the U.S. side to bear full responsibility for the serious consequences that are bound to arise from its disruption of the explanation work.

Although our captured personnel have been transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the custody of Indian troops, in fact, the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents deployed by the U.S. side are strictly controlling and threatening the prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camps. Today's prisoner of war camps have become a more dark and terrifying world than Hitler's Auschwitz concentration camp.

General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, confirmed that "the Nan Young camp housing Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war is full of vicious and gloomy atmosphere." There, the special agents dared to publicly beat and cut the flesh of a prisoner of war who expressed his longing for his motherland in front of all the prisoners of war in a camp, and then dug out his heart, poured gasoline on it and burned it, in order to intimidate the remaining prisoners of war. There, the special agents privately set up "dungeons" to arbitrarily imprison and bury alive prisoners of war suspected of "wanting to return." There, the special agents forcibly sent the so-called "unreliable elements" among the prisoners of war to "hospitals" for isolation, and even clamped them to death with wooden sticks, or trampled them to death. There, the special agents openly implemented a "joint guarantee" method, announcing that anyone who violated the special agents' orders to go out to listen to the explanation or request repatriation would be grabbed back and executed by the "joint guarantors," otherwise the "joint guarantors" would be beaten to death.

In order to implement the U.S. side's plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war and obstruct and sabotage our side's explanation work, the Rhee and Chiang special agents have recently become even more openly unscrupulous in using various tortures to kill North Korean and Chinese captured personnel who requested repatriation. In early October, our returning personnel accused the Kuomintang special agents of the serious incident of digging out the heart and executing prisoner of war Zhang Zilong. However, this incident was not dealt with sternly in time, and the murderous arrogance of the Rhee and Chiang special agents became even more rampant. Our returning personnel continued to reveal that at least four North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who requested repatriation were killed by special agents in the Neutral Nations custodial camp hospital. The Indian custodial troops also confirmed on October 28th that in the past few days, four North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were hanged, smashed to death, starved to death and hanged by the Rhee and Chiang special agents, respectively. Three days later, the Indian custodial troops announced again that another North Korean prisoner of war was beaten to death by special agents, and another was beaten injured. News of atrocities continues to come one after another, which cannot but arouse great anger among all peace-loving people.

At present, the Rhee and Chiang special agents have adopted the heinous means of killing people to destroy evidence. They dared to chop the corpses of the brutally slaughtered prisoners of war into pieces of meat and burn them. How many North Korean and Chinese captured personnel have been massacred is impossible to know completely. Here, people cannot help but think of the whereabouts of the three hundred and forty of our captured personnel who firmly demanded direct repatriation, which the U.S. side has consistently refused to explain. Where did those many prisoners of war go? The U.S. side must be held responsible for explaining this matter clearly.

The reason why the Rhee and Chiang special agents are so rampant is entirely instigated by the U.S. side. Everyone knows that before handing over the prisoners of war, the U.S. side sent a large number of specially trained Rhee and Chiang special agents into the prisoners of war, disguised as prisoners of war, and insisted on retaining the special agent organizations in the prisoners of war intact. The U.S. side also tried every despicable and shameless means to contact, direct and support the Rhee and Chiang special agents in the prisoners of war. Our returning personnel revealed that the special agent bosses in the prisoner of war camps could ride the so-called "garbage trucks" to "escape" from the prisoner of war camps to Seoul to directly receive instructions, and then openly ride the so-called "garbage trucks" back to the prisoner of war camps to do evil. When our side conducted the explanation on October 31st, there were even people among the so-called U.S. "representatives" who had served as "chairmen" in the prisoner of war camps. A prisoner of war who was listening to the explanation asked him on the spot: "Chairman, can I go back?" People, look: the "chairman" who ruled the prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camp yesterday has become the U.S. officially dispatched "representative" who threatens the prisoners of war tomorrow. What a despicable farce. Facts have proved that many of the so-called "chairmen" and "battalion commanders" who persecuted prisoners of war on Geoje Island and Jeju Island are not prisoners of war at all, but executioners sent by the United States to massacre prisoners of war and sabotage repatriation work. Some of them continue to abuse and kill prisoners of war in the Indian custodial camps, while others have transformed themselves into official "representatives" of the U.S. side. Is this something that any person with blood can tolerate?

The U.S. side's illegal behavior is a serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Clause 18 of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that "neither side shall interfere with or influence the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the performance of its duties, under any name or in any manner"; but the U.S. side has violently interfered with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the most despicable means of sending special agents. Almost all the clauses stipulated in the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" promulgated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have been destroyed by the Rhee and Chiang special agents. The explanation work schedule stipulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has also been repeatedly delayed and disrupted due to the obstruction and sabotage of the Rhee and Chiang special agents. Clause 3 of the "Scope of Authority" regarding not inflicting violence on prisoners of war or insulting their dignity or self-esteem has been completely destroyed by the U.S. special agents' insane massacre of prisoners of war. Clause 7 of the "Scope of Authority" regarding not undermining the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has become an undue mockery of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself.

In order to insist on the implementation of the Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in order to safeguard the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's power to perform its legitimate duties, our side insists on thoroughly investigating and handling the atrocities of the special agent elements in the U.S. prisoner of war camps; this is extremely proper. Because only by thoroughly eliminating those special agent executioners can the situation in the prisoner of war camps be changed, can the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission maintain its power to perform its duties, so that the explanation work can be carried out normally. In accordance with Clauses 3 and 7 of the Scope of Authority, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has full power to take effective action to lift the control of the special agent elements, so as to turn the concentration camp created by the U.S. special agents into a prisoner of war camp under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in name and in fact. Our side has already submitted to the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a partial list (466 names) of the U.S. special agents in the prisoner of war camps after verification. This has given the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission favorable conditions for carrying out this just work. The broad public of the world is concerned about and watching the actual actions taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in this regard.

However, recently, U.S. news agencies have released air saying that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission wants to investigate the atrocities of the special agents, "riots will certainly occur" in the prisoner of war camps. This shameless intimidation proves precisely that the U.S. side is very afraid that the truth about its crimes in the prisoner of war camps will be completely exposed. And the so-called "riots" used by the U.S. side to scare people are not new tricks. The U.S. side has turned the prisoner of war camps into a dark and chaotic world of thugs, isn't this already a "riot"? The U.S. special agent elements are arrogant in the prisoner of war camps, and even brazenly detain Indian custodial troop officers and threaten them with unreasonable demands, isn't this already a "riot"? In fact, it is the U.S. side that is creating and will continue to create "riots" in the custodial camps. The people of the U.S. side outside the prisoner of war camps and the special agents in the prisoner of war camps are echoing each other. Whoever listens to the intimidating words of the U.S. spokespersons wearing suits outside the prisoner of war camps will inevitably condone the U.S. special agents holding weapons inside the prisoner of war camps from acting recklessly. Since there is the existence of the special agents' force control and threat in the prisoner of war camps, then if it is necessary to guarantee the right of the prisoners of war to listen to the explanation and freely express their will to repatriate, it is absolutely necessary to stop the terrorist atrocities of the special agent elements; if it is necessary to avoid the recurrence of "riot" incidents, it is absolutely necessary to eliminate the special agent elements in the prisoner of war camps. Here, no other method will work.

Now, the U.S. plan to fundamentally sabotage the explanation work by using the special agents' terrorist rule over the prisoners of war is no longer concealable. The United States is attempting to drag the explanation work beyond ninety days by this despicable and brutal means, so that it can detain these prisoners of war at will. This is clearly a long-planned conspiracy by the United States. People remember that the U.S. side has already instigated the South Korean government and its army to forcibly "release" 27,000 of our captured personnel, and has not yet recovered them. Of the 98,742 of our captured personnel listed by our side at the Military Armistice Commission on September 21st, 76,140 have not been repatriated to date, are not included in the death and escape lists submitted by the U.S. side, and are not in the prisoner of war camps under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. side must explain one by one what has become of these people, and immediately stop its insane crimes in the prisoner of war camps, so that the prisoners of war can freely listen to the explanation completely in accordance with the arrangements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and express their desire to repatriate. At the same time, the explanation period must be extended in accordance with the actual time of the explanation work, until the side to which the prisoners of war belong completes eight hours a day for a total of ninety days of explanation work. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for all the incidents of special agent elements in the Indian custodial camps abusing and massacring prisoners of war. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should accept the reasonable and specific suggestions put forward by our side on October 29th, resolutely and thoroughly investigate the abuse and massacre incidents carried out by special agents in the Indian custodial camps, severely punish the murderers who killed the prisoners of war, and completely eliminate the special agent elements from the prisoner of war camps. The Chinese people and the people of the world will fully support all these effective and just measures of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    坚决清算美方特务残杀战俘的罪行
    目前，朝中方面根据朝鲜停战协定对于不直接遣返的战俘所进行的解释工作，正遭到美方变本加厉的阻挠和破坏，从而陷入了极端严重的连续停顿和中断的状态，以致自十月十五日开始解释以来的十九天中，我方进行的全部时间只有十五个小时，还不到两天的解释时间。美方这种藐视和破坏中立国遣返委员会职权范围、粗暴地阻止战俘遣返的行为，显然已对朝鲜停战协定造成重大威胁。为此，我方代表在十月三十一日朝鲜军事停战委员会上，再次向美方提出强硬抗议，并警告美方要对其破坏解释工作所必然引起的严重后果负完全责任。
    尽管我方被俘人员已被移交给中立国遣返委员会和印度部队看管，但事实上，美方所布置的李承晚和蒋介石特务在战俘营里正严密地控制着，和以武力威胁着战俘，今天的战俘营，已变成了比希特勒的奥斯维辛集中营更加暗无天日的恐怖世界了。
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军证实说：“收容中国和北朝鲜战俘的南营中，充满了凶恶和阴郁的气氛。”在那里，特务们敢于在一个营场的全体战俘面前，公开将一个表露了怀念祖国情绪的战俘毒打割肉，然后挖出他的心脏浇上汽油燃烧，以恐吓其余的战俘。在那里，特务们私设“土牢”，随意禁锢和活埋有“遣返嫌疑”的战俘。在那里，特务们把战俘中的所谓“不可靠分子”强送到“医院”里隔离起来，甚至用木棍活活把他夹死，或者把他踩死。在那里，特务们公开实行“连保”办法，宣布谁要是违反特务命令出去听取解释或要求遣返，就由“连保”的人冲出去把他抓回处死，否则做“连保”的就要被打死。
    李、蒋特务为了执行美方强迫扣留战俘的计划、阻挠和破坏我方的解释工作，最近更公开无忌地以各种酷刑来杀害要求遣返的朝中被俘人员。我方归来人员在十月初曾控诉了国民党特务挖心处死战俘张子龙的严重事件。但是这一事件没有及时得到严正的处理，李、蒋特务们的杀人凶焰就更加嚣张了。我方归来人员继续揭露，至少有四名要求遣返的朝中被俘人员在中立国看管营医院里被特务杀害了。印度看管部队在十月二十八日也证实，过去数天中有四名朝中战俘被李、蒋特务分别绞死、砸死、饿死和吊死。三天后印度看管部队又宣布，又有朝鲜籍战俘一人被特务殴打致死，另一人被打伤。暴行消息有加无已地连续传来，不能不引起每一个爱好和平的人民的极大愤怒。
    目前李、蒋特务们又采取杀人灭迹的万恶手段。他们胆敢把被残酷屠杀了的战俘的尸体剁成肉段加以烧毁。朝中被俘人员究竟有多少已被残杀，已无法全部知道，在这里，人们不能不联想到美方一直拒绝交代的三百四十名坚决要求直接遣返的我方被俘人员的下落。那许多战俘究竟到那儿去了呢？对于这个问题美方必须负责交代清楚。
    李、蒋特务之所以这样横行无忌，完全是美方一手指使的。谁都知道、美方在移交战俘之前就把大批受了特别训练的李、蒋特务派到战俘当中混充战俘，并且坚持原封不动地保留战俘中的特务组织。美方又想尽种种卑鄙无耻的办法来联络、指挥和支持战俘中的李、蒋特务。我方归来人员揭露，战俘营中的特务头子可以乘坐所谓“垃圾车”“逃出”战俘营到汉城去直接领取指令，然后又公然乘坐所谓“垃圾车”回到战俘营中为非作歹。十月三十一日我方进行解释时，所谓美方“代表”中竟有人就是曾在战俘营中担任“委员长”的特务。一名听取解释的战俘当场向他发问：“委员长，我能不能回去？”人们看看吧：昨天在战俘营中统治战俘的“委员长”，明天就变成美国官方派出的威胁战俘的“代表”了。这是多么卑鄙的滑稽戏。事实证明战俘营中有许多在巨济岛和济州岛迫害战俘的所谓“委员长”、“大队长”之类的人物，根本不是战俘，而是由美国派进去屠杀战俘、破坏遣返工作的刽子手。他们现在有的继续在印度看管营里虐杀战俘，有的却摇身一变而成为美方的官方“代表”。这难道是任何有血性的人所能容忍的吗？
    美方的这种非法行为是严重地违反朝鲜停战协定的。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十八款规定：对中立国遣返委员会在执行其任务时的工作，“双方不得以任何名义和任何方式加以干涉或加以影响”；但美方却以派遣特务这种最卑鄙的方式，横暴地干涉中立国遣返委员会的工作。中立国遣返委员会所公布的“解释和访问工作细则”中规定的各条款，差不多全部被李、蒋特务所破坏了。中立国遣返委员会所规定的解释工作日程，也都因为李、蒋特务的阻挠、破坏而一再被拖延和打乱。“职权范围”第三款所规定的不得对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊的条文，已为美方特务疯狂残杀战俘而被破坏无余，“职权范围”第七款关于不得削弱中立国遣返委员会的权力的规定已经变成了对中立国遣返委员会本身不应有的嘲弄了。
    为了坚持中立国遣返委员会职权范围的实施，为了维护中立国遣返委员会执行其合法职务的权力，我方坚持主张对美方战俘营中特务分子的暴行进行彻底的调查和处理；这是极为正当的。因为只有把那些特务刽子手彻底肃清，才能使战俘营的状况改变，才能使中立国遣返委员会保持其执行职务的权力，从而使解释工作得以正常进行。按照职权范围第三和第七两款的规定，中立国遣返委员会完全有权力采取有效行动，来解除特务分子的控制，从而把美方特务所制造的集中营变为名符其实的在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营。我方早已把战俘营中美方特务的部分名单（四百六十六名），经查明后，提交给中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队。这就使中立国遣返委员会在进行这一公正工作时，有了有利的条件。世界广大公众都关心地注视着中立国遣返委员会在这方面所采取的实际行动。
    然而，最近美国通讯社却放出空气说，如果中立国遣返委员会要对特务暴行进行调查，战俘营就“一定会发生暴乱”。这种无耻的恫吓恰恰证明美方十分恐惧它在战俘营中罪行的真相完全暴露。而美方用以吓人的所谓“暴乱”则早已不是什么新的计谋了。美方把战俘营弄成了天昏地暗的暴徒世界，难道这不已经是“暴乱”吗？美方特务分子在战俘营中气焰万丈，甚至悍然扣留印度看管部队军官，并以无理要求相威胁，难道这不已经是“暴乱”吗？事实上正在并还要继续在看管营中制造“暴乱”的正是美方。美方在战俘营外的人们和在战俘营内的特务是互相呼应的。谁要是听信在战俘营外穿着礼服的美国发言人的恫吓之词，谁就必然会放纵在战俘营内拿着武器的美方特务的胡作非为。既然战俘营中有着特务的武力控制和威胁存在，那末如果要保障战俘听取解释和自由表达遣返意志的权利，就绝对需要制止特务分子的恐怖暴行；如果要避免“暴乱”事件不再发生，就绝对需要清除战俘营中的特务分子。在这里，任何其他办法都是行不通的。
    现在，美国利用特务分子对战俘的恐怖统治来根本破坏解释工作的计划，已经是无法掩饰了。美国企图用这种卑鄙和残暴的手段，把解释工作拖过九十天以后，就可以随心所欲地扣留这些战俘。这显然是美国蓄谋已久的勾当。人们记得，美方已经怂恿南朝鲜政府及其军队强行“释放”了二万七千名我方被俘人员，至今未予追回。我方九月二十一日在军事停战委员会上所提出的九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员名单中，有七万六千一百四十名迄今没有被遣返，又不包括在美方交来的死亡与逃亡的名单中，也不在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营中，这些人究竟下落如何，美方必须一一交代，并立即停止它在战俘营中的疯狂罪行，使战俘能有自由完全按照中立国遣返委员会的安排听取解释，并表达他们要求遣返的愿望。同时，解释期限必须按照解释工作实际进行时间予以顺延，直到战俘所属一方完成每天八小时一共九十天的解释工作为止。所有在印度看管营中特务分子虐害和残杀战俘的事件必须由美方负完全责任。中立国遣返委员会应该接受我方于十月二十九日提出的合理的具体建议，坚决彻底调查印度看管营中特务进行的虐害屠杀事件，严惩杀害战俘的凶手，并把特务分子从战俘营中全部清除。中国人民和全世界人民都将全力支持中立国遣返委员会这一切有效的公正措施。
