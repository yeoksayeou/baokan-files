    Industrial Production Development Helps Agricultural Production Develop Even More
    The peasants of Xiao Li Tuan Village, Second District, Pingdu County, Shandong Province, understanding the benefits to both the nation and themselves of selling grain to the state, are actively selling grain to the state or depositing it with the state.
    Initially, some peasants in this village were not very willing to sell grain due to insufficient understanding of the significance of selling grain to the state. District and township cadres conducted propaganda and education among the peasants during the process of guiding production. By summarizing the reasons for the increased production in recent years and comparing the changes in prices before and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the peasants realized that only when the country is built better can the production and living standards of the peasants be improved. Through discussions on the assistance of industry to agriculture and the changes in the prices of industrial and agricultural products, the peasants realized the importance of supporting national industrial construction and that only when industry develops can agricultural production develop further, and peasants can buy cheaper and better industrial products. For example, military dependent Li Qingfu said: "In the past, when insects harmed crops in the fields, there was no place to buy insecticides even if you had money, and if you did buy them, they were terribly expensive. In the past, 32 jin of wheat could only be exchanged for 1.5 jin of "Yu Hong Jia" (a kind of flour), now it can be exchanged for 19 jin; in the past, 32 jin of wheat could only buy 2 jin of kerosene, now it can buy 8 jin; in the past, there were no waterwheels, now the higher authorities lend us waterwheels. These are all the benefits that the development of national industry has brought to us peasants." The peasants in this village also recalled the losses they suffered when prices were unstable in the past, and discussed the benefits they have gained from price stability in recent years. Li Minshan said: "In the past, speculators disrupted the market, and prices fluctuated wildly, causing peasants to suffer a lot. Now, the state has a large amount of grain and materials in its hands, which stabilizes prices, and we will no longer suffer such losses. Now we sell grain to the state, and the state has more grain and other materials, which can ensure even greater price stability." He stated that he would deposit 62 jin of wheat with the cooperative. Li Qinglin also said: "Depositing one jin is still one jin, and it won't grow more if it's kept at home. I will deposit 66 jin of wheat with the state and sell 600 jin of soybeans to support national construction."
    On the basis of improved ideological awareness, all the peasant households in the village held family meetings to discuss selling grain to the state and supporting national construction. Now, all 34 peasant households in the village have deposited 732 jin of wheat and sold 5,530 jin of soybeans to the state through the supply and marketing cooperative.

    Selling Grain to the State is Agriculture Supporting Industry
    This year, Liu Hongyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nan Yinbi Village, Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, had a bumper wheat harvest, with an average yield of 363.3 jin per mu of dryland wheat, exceeding last year by 192 percent. However, some members were unwilling to sell wheat when it came time to sell it. To mobilize the members to sell wheat to the state, the head of the cooperative, Liu Hongyu, encouraged the members to study the reasons for the bumper harvest, so that everyone could understand the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. Member Wei Fuan said: "Our cooperative has had bumper harvests for years, isn't that thanks to the help of our worker elder brothers! Our worker elder brothers made new-style farm implements for us, which improved our farming efficiency; especially since we have sprayers and pesticides, we can eliminate various pests and diseases and ensure a bumper harvest of crops." Women Xue Ling and Chun Ping also said: "We don't weave much cloth these years, most of what we wear and cover ourselves with is woven by our worker elder brothers, this is all the support our worker elder brothers give us!" Yan Heyi said: "Industry and agriculture can never be separated, only by supporting each other can we develop."
    After discussion, everyone's thinking became clearer, and they believed that selling wheat to the state was agriculture supporting industry, which could consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Many households proposed to substitute coarse grains for fine grains, saving more wheat to sell to the state. Yang Gaoqi said: "Using coarse grains instead of fine grains, the family will have ample grain, and we can sell more wheat to the state. Only when the country is industrialized, and our worker elder brothers manufacture more machines to supply us, can we further improve agricultural production." He and Du Tianyun sold 690 jin of wheat to the state at one time.
    In order to support national industrial construction, Liu Hongyu Agricultural Production Cooperative has sold more than 3,000 jin of wheat to the state.

    Turning Dead Grain into Living Capital
    In Supo Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, there is a farmer named Yan Shaocheng. Because he experienced that expanding production after selling grain to the state is very beneficial, he plans to sell more than 3,000 jin of rice to the state this year. By mid-October, he had already sold 1,800 jin of rice to the state.
    Yan Shaocheng's experience of turning dead wealth into living wealth is as follows: Last autumn, the government called for carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign, and he sold more than 1,400 jin of rice to the state, buying back 330 jin of oil cake, 60 jin of bone meal, 660 jin of night soil, and four pigs, applying nearly 100 jin more fertilizer per mu of land. At that time, some peasants laughed at him, and he himself was not very confident, fearing that he would not be able to recover his costs. This spring, his wheat and rapeseed both had bumper harvests. Rapeseed increased by 10% compared to last year. Wheat increased by 75% compared to last year (last year there was a reduced harvest), with a yield of more than 150 jin per mu higher than ordinary peasants. He carefully calculated the accounts, and the wheat and rapeseed together were equivalent to 2,860 jin of rice, not only recovering his costs but also exceeding them by more than double. He sold two pigs and bought back a water buffalo. At this time, even Yan, an old man in his sixties who used to laugh at him the most, said that he would learn from him. This year, after selling wheat and rapeseed, he invested funds worth about 2,500 jin of rice into production, and the autumn rice also had a bumper harvest, with an average increase of 15% compared to last year. With good production, living standards have also improved day by day. In one year, his family of nine has bought three bolts of homespun cloth and 17 zhang of commercial cloth, and the whole family, old and young, have made new clothes. Recently, they are also preparing to build a new house. When talking about his experience, he said: "Now I understand even better that no matter how much grain is hoarded, one jin will not turn into two jin. Investing in production is a different story. Dead grain turns into living capital, crops will have bumper harvests year after year, and life will get better day by day. Besides, selling grain to the state, the state uses it for construction and building factories. With more factories, the things they produce are cheaper, and we peasants will benefit even more." After selling grain this autumn, he has already bought back four pigs, and is also preparing to buy a large amount of fertilizer, to strive for a 10% increase in the yield of small spring crops next year compared to this year.

    Selling Grain to Add Farm Tools, Striving for a Great Harvest Next Year
    Mountainous peasants in Luocunba Township, First District, Ningqiang County, Shaanxi Province, after a bumper rice harvest this year, are selling grain in large quantities and adding draft cattle and farm tools to prepare for a bumper harvest next year.
    Luocunba Township is located in the mountainous area of ​​Ningqiang County. This year, the rice here has had a bumper harvest that has not been seen in more than ten years. Some peasants have therefore developed a sense of satisfaction and do not have high demands for expanding production. The local party committee and government promptly reminded the peasants not to be satisfied with this year's bumper harvest, and called on them to sell grain and add draft cattle, farm tools, etc., to strive for an even greater bumper harvest next year. After propaganda and education, the peasants throughout the township sold new grain one after another after the rice harvest. At present, peasants throughout the township have sold more than 7,400 jin of new rice to the state. The Chengguan District Cooperative also delivered more than 50 ploughshares to the peasants in accordance with the peasants' production needs. The Liu Jianhua Mutual Aid Group, because there were not enough draft cattle to use in the past, often affected the entire group's inability to sow in time, and at the same time the fertilizers were only human urine and manure, and the strength was not great enough. After the rice was brought to the threshing ground this year, this group sold more than 1,200 jin of rice and bought a new large ox, 500 jin of oil cake (tung oil cake) and two ploughshares. The group members happily said: This year we added a large ox and 500 jin of oil cake, and even the 500 jin of oil cake awarded by the government will be used for production, and next year we will definitely increase production even more than this year! He Zhengwu, a peasant in Yicun Village, has not worn new cotton clothes for several years. This year their mutual aid group also had a bumper harvest, and he sold 200 jin of rice and bought back cloth and cotton to make cotton clothes. Now the peasants throughout the township are still planning to continue selling grain to expand production and improve their lives.

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    工业生产发展了，农业生产才能更加发展
    山东省平度县二区小李疃村的农民，因为认识到了卖粮食给国家对国家和自己的好处，都纷纷把粮食卖给国家或向国家存实。
    起初，这个村有的农民因为对卖粮给国家的意义认识不足，不大愿意卖粮。当地区、乡干部在领导生产过程中对农民进行了宣传教育。通过总结近几年来生产提高的原因，对比中华人民共和国成立前后物价的变化，农民们认识到只有国家建设得越好，农民的生产和生活水平才越能提高。通过座谈工业对农业的帮助和工农业产品价格的变化，农民们认识到支援国家工业建设的重要性，认识到工业发展了，农业生产才能更加发展，农民才能买到更便宜和更好的工业品。如军属李清福说：“在过去，地里虫子害庄稼，有钱没处买虫药，买到也贵得厉害。过去三十二斤小麦只能换一斤半“玉红架”，现在能换十九斤；过去三十二斤麦子只能买二斤火油，现在能买八斤；过去没有水车，现在上级贷给水车。这都是国家工业发展了，给咱农民的好处。”这个村的农民还回忆了过去物价不稳定时吃的亏，座谈了这几年物价稳定得到的好处。李民三说：“过去投机商人捣乱市场，物价忽涨忽落，农民吃了不少亏。现在国家手里有大批粮食和物资，使物价稳定了，我们再不吃那样的亏了。我们现在卖粮食给国家，国家有了更多的粮食和其他物资，物价就能保证更稳定。”他表示要将六十二斤小麦存到合作社。李清林也说：“存实一斤是一斤，搁在家里也不能多长些。我要把六十六斤小麦向国家存实，卖六百斤大豆支援国家建设。”
    全村农民在思想觉悟提高的基础上，户户开了家庭会，商议把粮食卖给国家，支援国家建设。现在，全村三十四户农民，已经向供销合作社存实小麦七百三十二斤，卖给国家大豆五千五百三十斤。
    把粮食卖给国家，就是农业支援工业
    山西省洪洞县南尹壁村刘洪玉农业生产合作社今年小麦丰收，每亩旱地麦平均产三百六十三斤三两，超过去年百分之一百九十二。但是在出售小麦时，有的社员不愿出售。社长刘洪玉为了动员社员把小麦卖给国家，通过发动社员研究丰收原因，使大家认识了工农联盟的重要性。社员尉福安说：“咱社历年丰产，还不是工人老大哥帮助的！工人老大哥给咱造出新式农具，提高了咱们的耕作效率；特别是咱们有了喷雾器和药剂，才能消灭各种病虫害，保证庄稼丰收。”妇女学灵、春萍也说：“咱这几年不多织布了，大部穿的、盖的都是工人老大哥织造的，这都是工人老大哥对咱们的支援！阎合义说：“工农业怎么也不能分离，只有互相支援，才能得到发展。”
    经过讨论，大家思想都亮了，认为把小麦卖给国家，就是农业支援工业，就能巩固工农联盟。好多户都提出要以粗粮代细粮，多节省出小麦卖给国家。杨高奇说：“以粗顶细，家庭粮食宽裕了，还可以把更多的小麦卖给国家。只有国家工业化了，工人老大哥制造更多的机器供应咱们，才能进一步提高农业生产。”他和杜天云一次就卖给国家六百九十斤小麦。
    为了支持国家工业建设，刘洪玉农业生产合作社已卖给国家三千多斤小麦。
    把死粮食变成活本钱
    四川省温江县苏坡乡有个农民叫晏绍成。他因为体验到把粮食卖给国家后扩大生产，好处很大，今年准备把三千多斤大米卖给国家。到十月中旬，他已卖给国家大米一千八百斤。
    晏绍成把死财变成活财的体验是这样的：去年秋天，政府号召开展爱国增产运动，他卖给国家一千四百多斤大米，买回三百三十斤油饼、六十斤骨粉、六百六十斤大粪和四只猪，每亩田多上了将近一百斤肥料。当时有的农民嘲笑他，他自己也不大放心，害怕不能捞回本钱。今年春天，他的小麦、菜子都得到丰收。菜子较去年增产一成。麦子较去年增产七成半（去年减产）每亩产量较一般农民高一百五十多斤。他仔细一算账，麦子、菜子共折合大米二千八百六十斤，不但捞回本钱，还超过一倍。他卖掉两只猪，还买回一头耕牛。这时，连从前嘲笑他最厉害的六十多岁的晏老汉，也表示要向他学习。今年卖了麦子、菜子，他又把约值二千五百斤大米的资金投入生产，秋天水稻也得到丰收，平均比去年增产一成半。生产搞好了，生活水平也日益提高。一年中，他家九口人已买了三匹土布和十七丈市布，全家老小都做了新衣服。最近还准备盖一间新房子。他谈到他的体验时说：“现在我更明白，粮食囤得再多，一斤不会变两斤。投入生产，情形就两样。死粮食变成活本钱，庄稼年年会丰收，生活也一天比一天好。再说，把粮食卖给国家，国家用来搞建设，办工厂。工厂多了，出的东西便宜，我们农民就更有好处。”他今年秋季卖粮后，已经买回四只猪，还准备买大批肥料，要争取明年小春作物比今年再增产一成。
    卖粮食添农具，争取明年大丰收
    陕西省宁强县一区罗村坝乡山区农民，今年稻谷丰收后，大量卖出粮食，添置耕牛、农具，为明年争取丰收准备条件。
    罗村坝乡在宁强县山区里。今年这里的稻谷，获得了十多年来没有过的大丰收。部分农民因此产生了满足的想法，对扩大生产的要求不高。当地党委、政府及时提醒农民们不要满足于今年的丰收，号召他们出卖粮食，添置耕牛、农具等，争取明年更大的丰收。经过宣传教育，全乡农民在稻谷收割后，纷纷出卖新谷。目前全乡农民已卖给国家七千四百多斤新稻谷。城关区合作社也按照农民生产上的要求，把五十多个犁铧送到农民的手中。刘建华互助组，过去因为耕牛不够使用，往往影响全组都不能及时播种，同时肥料也只是些人尿粪，力量不够大。今年稻谷上场后，这个组卖了一千二百多斤稻谷，新买了一条大牛，五百斤油渣（即桐油饼）和两个犁铧。组员都高兴地说：今年添一头大牛和五百斤油渣，连政府奖励的五百斤油渣，都用到生产上去，明年比今年一定还会增产！一村的农民何正吴，几年来就没有穿过新棉衣，今年他们互助组内也丰收了，他卖出了二百斤稻谷，买回布和棉花，缝制棉衣。现在全乡的农民，还在计划着继续出卖粮食，来扩大生产和改善生活。
