    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative is supplying a large quantity of materials to pastoral areas for herdsmen to get through the winter this year. According to statistics from four banners in Xilingol League in western Inner Mongolia, the supply of production and living materials needed by herdsmen in pastoral areas for the winter this year has increased by 61 percent compared with the same period last year. In the eastern part of the region, wood and other materials needed by herdsmen to build yurts and make "hazha" (portable fences used during nomadic grazing) were also supplied.
    This year's supply of winter materials to herdsmen, in addition to industrial products purchased from outside the region, grains, bean cakes, etc. are being adjusted within the autonomous region or organized for local handicraft workers to process. For example, the 465,000 jin of grain and 2.72 million jin of bean cakes needed in pastoral areas such as Chen Barag Banner are supplied by agricultural areas such as Butha Banner.

　　内蒙古自治区供销合作社
    供应牧民过冬物资
    内蒙古自治区供销合作社，今年以大量物资供应牧区牧民过冬。据内蒙西部牧区锡林郭勒盟四个旗的统计，今年供应牧区牧民过冬所需要的生产资料和生活资料比去年同时期增加了百分之六十一；在东部还供应了牧民们盖蒙古包、做哈栅（在游牧时能携带的围圈）所需用的木料等。
    今年供应牧民过冬的物资，除工业品由区外进货外，粮食、豆饼等都在自治区内进行调剂或组织当地手工业者加工。如陈巴尔虎旗等牧区所需要的四十六万五千斤粮食，二百七十二万斤豆饼，都由布达哈旗等农业区供给。这些物资除一部分通过那达慕大会和由合作社的门市部出售外，今冬各牧区还将组织六十多个流动供应小组，带着货物到牧场流动供应。
