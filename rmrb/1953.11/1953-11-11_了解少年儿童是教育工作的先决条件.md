    Understanding Children is a Prerequisite for Educational Work
    Lin Liru
    In the four years since the founding of New China, over 50 million children have enrolled in schools nationwide, and 7 million have joined the Young Pioneers. This fact proves that our children are cherished in the new society and that the cause of children's education has developed. Schools and the Young Pioneers have made considerable achievements in carrying out new knowledge education and patriotic education, and a number of model and progressive educators have emerged. We have been successful in cultivating a new generation over the past four years. However, it cannot be denied that the bad habits left over from the old society have not yet been eradicated, and some people still look down on children's education, mistakenly believing that doing educational work is not promising. Furthermore, some people treat children rashly with crude methods, coercion, and even struggle, resulting in significant losses in our work. This is a phenomenon that must be corrected in the future.
    It is self-evident that we must clearly understand our working objects in whatever work we do. A car driver must understand the car, a knight must understand the horse, a horticulturist must understand the plants, and an educator must of course understand the children. In fact, understanding children is much more difficult than understanding cars, horses, or plants. It would be a great mistake to consider educating children as something everyone can do, not worth understanding, let alone studying.
    Childhood is a period of extremely vigorous and rapid development in life. The time from infancy to youth accounts for about a quarter of a person's lifespan. The other side of development means immaturity. Because children are immature for a relatively long time, they can learn many skills. This is also called the plasticity of children, that is, educability. With this plasticity, children can basically learn the cultural heritage accumulated by their ancestors over millions of years in one or two decades. Therefore, childhood—in a broad sense—is a treasure of life. For example, arithmetic at the primary school level is scientific knowledge that humans have accumulated for millions of years, but modern children can learn it in primary school in only about 1,200 hours. How cheap is that! When our children can develop and grow in this way, humanity can progress infinitely.
    The development of children from birth to maturity is an extremely complex and rapid process. Although research on children's physical and mental development has not yet reached its highest achievements, it has already found its basic developmental laws. We should master this regularity.
    The various aspects of children's physical and mental development—organs and functions—do not develop equally, but have different priorities and speeds. Try enlarging a photo of a five- or six-year-old child to seven or eight feet, and it is still a child, because his head is big and his legs are short. Anyone can tell that it is a child's photo at a glance. This shows that the development of the head and the development of the legs are not equal. By the time they are fourteen or fifteen years old, their legs grow quickly, but their heads do not grow much larger. This is the most obvious example, and the same is true for other functions.
    The developmental changes in various aspects of the body and mind are not isolated from each other, but interact with each other to form a unified personality development. Changes in parts often manifest as comprehensive changes in the development process, and this development process is holistic. For example, children are prone to fatigue due to their fast heart rate, and their attention is difficult to sustain, thus showing a childishness that is fickle and impatient. In each stage of development, infants, children, adolescents, and youths all display the comprehensive features of each stage in their posture, demeanor, speech, actions, temperament, and preferences. This is what we can easily observe.
    Due to the imbalance in the development of various aspects of the body and mind, which constantly forms a unified development process, we can say that the process of children's development is staged, and each stage has its own characteristics. The stages alternate regularly, with the previous stage preparing the next stage. At a certain time, the characteristics of the next stage suddenly begin to appear. For example, with regard to thinking, some people often mistakenly believe that it only begins in adolescence and that there is no thinking in childhood. That is not the case. Children aged eight or nine also have thinking, but it is characterized by concreteness and sensibility. Children learn language in primary school precisely to learn to think. That is to say, they understand the things explained in the language textbook, and they also learn to use vocabulary, sentences, and grammar to think. If children cannot think, how can primary school students learn language? Our ancient textbook—the Three Character Classic—said: "Read it aloud, think it in your heart." This means that the mouth is reading the book, and the heart is understanding and thinking. The problem with many teachers is that they do not know that language teaching is thinking education, and they only want children to mechanically recognize words and recite books. Such language teaching is bound to fail. The concrete and sensual thinking of childhood accumulates for a period of time, which prepares the conditions for abstract thinking in adolescence and youth. It can be seen that the process of children's development is a process in which gradual change and sudden change are dialectically intertwined and combined.
    The process of children's physical and mental development is by no means a purely biological process as described by bourgeois child psychology. Children develop in the human social environment, social relationships—class relationships—and in today's cultural environment. It would be a big mistake to consider children's development apart from social class relations and the cultural environment. The sounds of children in Hebei and Lingnan are the same when they are born, but they speak differently when they grow up. This is because the language environment in the two places is different. As for the barking of dogs in Hebei and Guangdong, it is the same because they do not have a language environment.
    Children's acceptance of the influence of the social environment is by no means as passive and helpless as the way plants and animals are influenced by the natural environment. Rather, they may use a positive and active attitude to meet or resist it. The environment is not only accepted by people, but can also be changed by people. When children can actively cope with the environment, they may change the environment's impact on themselves. Progressive social education is precisely the act of purposefully and systematically guiding children to deal with the environment in a positive manner. For example, children in China today all know that American imperialists are hateful and hateful, while few knew it in the era of Kuomintang reactionaries. Did American imperialism suddenly become hateful in the last four years? No. It is because our education today is education under the leadership of the working class, so we can help children reveal the hateful face of American imperialism. Children develop themselves as members of society, in the environment created by their ancestors, with a positive and active attitude and in contact with the real environment. The more effective the education work is, the more children's initiative and dynamism will be enhanced, and thus the more effectively they can understand the environment, criticize the environment, accept those influences, and resist those influences. Only in a people's society can children receive such education. Therefore, it should also be said that in a people's society, among the various influences the environment has on children, education can play a leading role.
    The social environment is not static, but is constantly changing and developing, so the impact on children is also constantly changing. In a society ruled by the exploiting class, especially in a society ruled by the class that is about to decline, although there are also changes, because the ruling class does not recognize the existence of change, and does its best to resist progressive things and defend corrupt things, such a society cannot have reasonable education, and it is difficult for children to develop normally. Only in a society where the people truly hold power do people publicly recognize social change, publicly recognize that new things should emerge and old things should die, and advance society towards an ideal in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with the laws of social development. Such social change and development is rich and rapid, and thus the impact on children's development is also rich and rapid. Such a society is a socialist society, and we are gradually transitioning to a socialist society today. In such a society, education work can move in the correct direction of social development, examine the level of each stage of children's development, and lead children to understand what they can and should understand, accept those influences that they can and should accept, and criticize or resist those influences that they can and should criticize or resist. Here, the task of educators is pleasant and glorious, and at the same time, it is very arduous, and the knowledge required is broad, rich, and profound. If educators today still use the old methods of coercion, ridicule, scolding, and even chaotic rectification, random struggle, or corporal punishment to treat children, it will inevitably be too ill-considered.
    From the above simple explanation, it can be seen that the objects of our educational work are the concrete and vibrant children of the new democratic society, who will grow up to be members of the socialist society in the future. The development of each of them contains the sum of their talents, endowments, characteristics, knowledge, and cultivation, and also contains the influence of all the social, family, class, social interaction, and school education they have received in their lives. Our society is gradually transitioning to a socialist society. This is very complex, and it is still a process of change and development. Therefore, we must be very cautious and careful in our work. I will now put forward a few points based on my understanding for reference:
    First, we must pay great attention to children's health: Children are developing, just like the tender shoots of plants. Their future development is certainly great, but at the same time, they are also easily harmed. If they develop smoothly during this period, it will be a lifelong happiness; if they suffer injuries, it will delay their entire lives, and may even lead to premature death. For example, children are prone to encephalitis, infectious skin diseases, various tuberculosis, and are also prone to hunchbacks, dislocations, fractures, enlarged tonsils, etc. This has all been proven by medicine. Children live collectively in schools, and if the sanitary environment is not well arranged, infectious diseases are prone to occur or spread. School physical education is intended to help children's physical development, and if it causes harm, it will be a great violation of the original intention of physical education. Excessive academic burden, which causes constant overwork, is also detrimental. Physical education teachers and school doctors are of course directly responsible for children's health, but principals, homeroom teachers, and Young Pioneer counselors must also pay attention to it frequently. Parents also have a responsibility to provide advice to schools and teams at any time. Childhood and adolescence, boys and girls each have their own characteristics that should be paid special attention to and should not be ignored. The development of the body and mind are closely related, and mental stimulation can affect physical health, and physical changes can also affect the spirit. These must all be handled with care. Health certainly requires active exercise to increase resistance, but it must also be appropriate. Exaggerating exercise too much without regard to developmental conditions is of course harmful.
    Second, pay attention to learning: As mentioned above, humans have a particularly long childhood period in order to develop in the social and cultural environment. This is one of the reasons for the endless progress of mankind. In the process of their development, children learn the culture created by their ancestors and master the practical experience of human society. They learn to use the materials around them and master the basic methods of material production in society. They step by step enter the increasingly broad scope of social relations, understand these relations, and learn various behaviors that connect them with people. They learn language, thereby mastering the things in the surrounding world that people know, understanding how people imagine them, how they are reacted to, and how they are understood. Therefore, in childhood, in addition to health first, the main task is learning. It should also be said that protecting health is for the sake of learning well. In capitalist society, they only know how to use children and exploit children's labor. In order to exploit children's labor more, they give children a little education. This is the origin of compulsory education in capitalist society. Our people's country cherishes children and wants them to learn well so that they can effectively serve the people when they grow up in the future. Therefore, during their immature childhood, the requirements for them are mainly learning. The main purpose of school extracurricular activities and Young Pioneer activities is still learning. Although children may also make some amazing contributions to public health, public security, and production through various activities, they are still centered on learning, and the main purpose is still to learn better, and work achievements are only by-products of learning. This is one point in which our people's country treats children very differently from capitalist society, and it should be noted. Since learning is the main task of children, we must arrange children's learning—classroom teaching, extracurricular activities, and club activities, etc.—to suit the conditions of their physical and mental development, so that they can learn better and develop further on the basis of their existing development. If these learning activities are not beneficial to children's development, or are harmful, then they are unacceptable. Therefore, on the one hand, we must look at the needs, and on the other hand, we must look at the extent of children's developmental conditions, that is, children's subjective possibilities. If it is not within the children's ability, and from their subjective point of view, they do not need this kind of learning. Therefore, it is wrong to treat children with the methods of educating adults and force them to cram things that children do not understand. However, if children's development has reached the possibility of some kind of learning, but we do not guide them to learn and do not stimulate their interest in learning, it also hinders children's growth. For example, as children's age and intelligence develop, the possibility of logical thinking gradually increases, so systematic scientific learning becomes necessary; if we still make excuses to wait for children's spontaneous interest and do not help them use their brains, it is also wrong. Therefore, we must carefully consider the age characteristics and personality characteristics of children when arranging all learning activities.
    Third, we must pay attention to the scientific achievements of research on children's development: Although research on children's development can still be considered an emerging science today and is not yet fully mature, it has also obtained some credible results in physiology and psychology, especially in the field of pediatric medicine. These results can help us carry out educational work and are worthy of attention. Of course, many of the current scientific principles cannot be considered the final rules and still have room for critical development. Moreover, what about the emerging theory of children's education? However, if a theory has been sufficiently demonstrated in practice, it can be used as a pointer for our work, at least for important reference, until better discoveries are made. We can only criticize it and revise it by more thoroughly examining it in practice and discovering more sufficient arguments. In other words, to criticize existing science, we can only rely on a higher level of science. If we educators despise existing educational science and children's educational theory, or even obliterate existing scientific theories with subjective conjecture or piecemeal experience analogy to boast of creation, it will be difficult to avoid being rash and making mistakes. It should be noted that being rash in production work will spoil some material data, while being rash in educational work will harm children's personality. Soviet educational theory is based on the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and their arguments are as comprehensive as possible, so it is worth learning from us. When learning the advanced educational methods of the Soviet Union, we must pay attention to the scientific theories on which those methods are based. They consider many aspects, including all aspects of children's physiological and psychological development. If we only use some forms of Soviet education methods and ignore the rich theoretical research in them, it will be tangible but soulless. Recently, some schools adopted the Soviet "Preparation for Labor and National Defense" system of physical education, but the result was a failure. The reason lies in this. Although it is difficult for every educator to become an expert in children's research, it is necessary for us to regularly pay attention to learning relevant scientific theories for the needs of our work.
    Fourth, deeply understand children: Modern educational theory has not yet reached a fully mature scientific state. Even if it becomes more advanced and developed in the future, it is estimated that it will not be possible to obtain formulas that can be applied without error like engineering. This is because the objects of engineering are inanimate substances, while the objects of our work are living children. This includes physiological changes, psychological changes, the influence of the history and culture of all social relations, and the education and upbringing that children have received before today. Because this development process is so complex, rich, and changeable, we cannot have formulas that can be used anywhere and anytime. Often, an educational method is effective for this child, but ineffective for another; the same child is suitable for this method today, but may not be suitable tomorrow. Even if it is a proven educational method, it still depends on the heart of the educator when applying it. How can we educators have such an exquisite heart? Only by deeply understanding. The prestige of an educator is that you win the trust of the children. Only then do you have authority over them and can you obtain the responses you expect from them. So you must love children in order to understand children. The more thoroughly you understand them, the more you will love them. Therefore, love and understanding are mutually cause and effect, and develop interactively. Love is by no means tolerance. You should treat children fairly, and it should be based on love in order to be effective. Often, a teacher criticizes a child's mistakes, and the child is not moved at all. But when another teacher comes, the child is moved to tears. The difference here is whether there is enough love. When you discover a child's strengths, you certainly love him. When you discover his shortcomings, and even want to punish him, only if you love him more can you think of all ways to firmly make him correct them. Giving students punishment is not retaliation, but a corrective measure. Only when he is moved by your love can he repent and change his ways. Educators love their motherland, love the peace-loving people of the world, and therefore love the new generation; in order to better educate children, they love all related sciences in order to do their work better. This is called "educational love." If you have something to love, you will of course also have something to hate, but you will hate bad things only if you can love good things. When you discover a child's shortcomings, and at the same time know that he has the possibility of learning well, you will insist that he correct them and never allow the shortcomings to remain permanently. Why are children prone to making mistakes? As mentioned above, the process of children's development contains contradictions, and this contradiction is more prominent in the actions of adolescents. They themselves contain contradictions, and they are unable to control them themselves, so they are prone to making mistakes. Educators must base themselves on the children's psychology, support their strengths, and encourage them to embark on the correct path in order to overcome those shortcomings. This should be the case in guiding children's lives, and it should also be the case in guiding learning assignments. Mistakes in learning assignments are often due to children having contradictions that they find difficult to overcome, either contradictions in thinking or contradictions in attention concentration and distraction. Elementary school children are even less able to overcome them on their own, so they must rely on the teacher's loving and correct help. It seems that correcting children's academic or behavioral mistakes must rely on the teacher's love. If the teacher only scolds or ridicules, it is harmful and useless. Educational love is by no means a simple soft heart, but for the sake of the future of the motherland, for the sake of the future of the children, and for the sake of scientific truth, it does not hesitate to seek the most effective educational methods, and never gives up until the goal is achieved. This contains great compassion, and also contains great wisdom and great decisiveness. Therefore, it is said that the best educational method exists in the personality of the best educator.
    Contradictions not only exist in the process of the development of various physiological and psychological functions of children, but some are reflections of social reality in children's minds. This reflection is rare in childhood, but it exists in adolescence, and it will be more common in youth. For example, the distress and bewilderment in adolescence and youth. As adolescents and youths come into deeper contact with social reality day by day and know more and more things every day, they will discover that there are some contradictions that are not easy to explain; and when they compare social reality with some of the theoretical knowledge they have learned, they will also find that there are inconsistencies, so they doubt, and therefore they are distressed. Bourgeois psychologists believe that this phenomenon of youth distress is the helpless fate of young people, calling it a psychological crisis. In fact, this is completely wrong. Capitalist societies have all kinds of irrational phenomena that they cannot resolve themselves, and they will never allow young people to know the truth, so they have to let them be distressed until they succumb to reality. In our people's society, discovering that young people have such questions is a good condition for us to carry out political and ideological education. We should point out to young people: which of these irrational realities are the remnants left over from the old society, how we are vigorously criticizing and eliminating them; which are the unavoidable facts in the transition period, which of these are the good sides, which are the bad sides, and how to develop the good and overcome the bad. As long as educators thoroughly understand the principles and policies of the people's country, and can earnestly instruct them with correct solutions within the limits of the understanding of young people, they can dispel their doubts and raise their understanding a step further. They recognize that the new society is not afraid to expose mistakes, not afraid to expose shortcomings, but has the courage to criticize and the ability to overcome them. What inevitable distress crisis is there? However, carrying out political and ideological education in this way is by no means the same as fighting ideological enemies. Educators should never stand in opposition to young people. Even if there are some mistakes in their understanding, they should only sympathetically support their demand for correct understanding and overcome that side of misunderstanding. If it is said to be a struggle, it can only be said that helping them to recognize the progressive side and backward side is to struggle. It is inappropriate to transplant the forms of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to carry out political and ideological education. Not only will it not solve the distress of young people, but it will deepen the distress.
    As long as educators can deeply understand children, they will see living physiology, living psychology, living political economy, and living social history in the process of children's development, and from there they will obtain excellent educational theories and methods. The meaning there is so rich, is it not worth our careful study? Deeply understanding children is also learning from children. Our ancient saying "teaching and learning promote each other" should be interpreted in this way.
    Comrades, educators! We must follow the instructions of the Party and the People's Government, and make the children healthy, learn well, and work well, and vigorously complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the motherland!

    了解少年儿童是教育工作的先决条件
    林砺儒
    新中国建国四年来，全国少年儿童入学的达到五千万名以上，而参加少年先锋队的也已达到七百万，这事实证明了我们的少年儿童在新社会是得到了爱护的，少年儿童教育事业是得到了发展的。学校和少年先锋队在进行新知识教育和爱国主义教育上，都做出了不少成绩，同时也涌现了一批模范的进步的教育工作者。四年来我们培养新的一代是有成绩的。可是由于旧社会遗留下来的陋习还未清除，还有人轻视少年儿童教育工作，而误认为做教育工作没出息；又还有人轻率地用粗暴的方法，强迫命令甚至于斗争的方式来对待少年儿童，因而造成了工作上很大的损失，这也是不容讳言而今后必须努力改正的现象。
    我们做那一种工作，都必须清楚地了解自己的工作对象，这是自明的真理。汽车司机必须了解汽车，骑士必须了解马，园艺家必须了解植物，教育工作者当然必须了解少年儿童。其实了解少年儿童是比了解车、马、植物难得多的。若偏偏把教育少年儿童看作人人会做的事，值不得进行了解，更谈不到钻研，那是很大的错误。
    少年儿童是人生发展极旺盛而迅速的时期，从婴儿期达到青年期这时间约占一个人寿命底四分之一。发展底另一面意味着未成熟，儿童由于相当长期未成熟，就可能学会许多的本领，所以这又叫做少年儿童底可塑性，即是可受教育性。少年儿童们凭着这可塑性就能够在一二十年的时间基本上学会祖先们经过千万年积累下来的文化遗产。所以说儿童期——广义的——是人生之宝。例如小学程度的算术，那是人类积累了千万年的经验才归纳出来的科学知识，可是现代的儿童在小学里只花一千二百小时左右就学会了，那是多么便宜啊！我们的孩子们能够这样发展成长，人类就因而能够无限地进步。
    孩子们从出生以至于成熟，这个发展是极复杂而又极迅速的过程。关于儿童身心发展的研究，虽然还没有达到最高的成果，但已经找到了它的基本发展规律，这种规律性，是我们所应该掌握的。
    儿童身心的各方面——各器官、各机能——不是平均地发展，而是有先后快慢的。试把一张五、六岁孩子的相片放大到七八尺，也还是个孩子，因为他的脑瓜大而腿短，谁一看也知道那是孩子的相片。这就说明了脑瓜的发育和腿的发育不是平均的。到了十四、五岁时，腿长得快，而脑瓜倒大不了多少了。这是最显著的例子，其他各机能也都如是。
    身心各方面的发展变化又不是彼此隔绝孤立的，而是交互影响成为统一的个性的发展。在发展过程中部分的变化往往表现为全面的变化，这发展过程还是整个的。例如儿童由于心脏跳动得快，就容易疲劳，注意力也难持久，因而表现出多心而又不耐烦的孩子气。在发展的各时期中，幼儿、儿童、少年和青年，他们的姿态，神气，言语行动，脾气嗜好，都显示着各个时期的全面的面貌，这是我们所容易观察得到的。
    由于身心各方面发展的不平衡，而又时时都形成统一的发展过程，我们就可以说儿童发展的过程是有阶段性的，每一个阶段都有那一阶段的特征。阶段和阶段之间有规律地交替着，前一阶段准备好后一阶段，到了一定时期才突然开始显出后一阶段的特征。例如思维，往往有人误认为要到了少年期才开始，童年期还没有思维。其实不然。八九岁的儿童也有思维作用，只是带有具体的感性的特征罢了。儿童在小学里学习语文，正是学习思维。就是说：他们了解语文课本所说明的事物，同时也学习运用语汇和句子语法来思维。假如小孩不会思维，那末，小学生怎能学习语文呢？我们的古老教本——三字经就说过：“口而诵，心而惟。”意思是说：口一面在念书，心一面在了解，在思维。不少教师的毛病正是不晓得语文教学是思维教育，而只要孩子们机械地认字背书。那样的语文教学便不能不失败。童年期的具体的感性的思维，蓄积了一个时期，便准备了以后少年期青年期进行抽象思维的条件。由此可见，儿童发展的过程是渐变和突变辩证地交织着结合着的过程。
    儿童身心发展的过程又决不是像资产阶级的儿童学所说的那样纯生物学的过程。儿童发展是在人类社会环境、社会关系——阶级关系之中，在今天的文化环境中。如果离开社会的阶级关系、文化环境来考虑儿童发展，那便是大错特错。河北的孩子和岭南的孩子呱呱堕地时，声音是一样的，而长大了说话就两样，这就因为两个地方的言语环境不同。至于河北的狗和广东的狗吠声却是一样的，就因为它们没有言语环境。
    儿童受社会环境的影响又决不是像动植物受自然环境影响的那样被动地无可奈何地接受，而是可能用积极的能动的态度来迎接或抗拒的。环境不只是为人所接受，同时也可为人所改变。当儿童能积极地应付环境时，他们便可能改变环境对自己的影响。进步的社会底教育正是有目的有计划地领导儿童用积极的态度应付环境底作用。例如今天中国的孩子都知道美帝国主义者可恶可恨，而在国民党反动派统治时代就很少知道。难道美帝国主义是在最近四年才忽然变得可恶了的吗？不是的。是因为今天我们的教育是在工人阶级领导下的教育，所以才能帮助孩子们把美帝国主义的可恶的面目揭露出来。儿童是以社会成员的身分，在曾经人类祖先所缔造的环境中，用积极的能动的态度和现实环境接触，这样地发展自己。教育工作做得越有效，儿童的积极性和能动性便越提得高，因而越能有效地了解环境，批评环境，接受那些影响，抗拒那些影响。只有在人民的社会，儿童才可以受到这样的教育。因此，又该说：在人民的社会，环境给儿童的诸影响之中，教育是可以起主导作用的。
    社会环境又不是一成不变的，而是经常地在变化发展，因而给儿童的影响也常在变化。在剥削阶级统治下的社会，尤其是在快要没落的阶级统治下的社会，虽也是有变化的，但由于统治阶级不承认变化存在，更用尽力量抗拒进步的东西而卫护腐朽的东西，因而那样的社会不可能有合理的教育，儿童们也很难得到正常的发展。只有人民真正掌握了政权的社会，人们才公认社会底变化，公认新的东西应该产生而陈旧的东西应该死亡，而且按照社会发展法则有计划有步骤地把社会向着理想推进。这样的社会变化发展是丰富而迅速的，因而影响儿童的发展也是丰富而迅速的。这样的社会是社会主义的社会，我们今天正在逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。在这样的社会中，教育工作就可能朝着社会发展的正确方向，审查着儿童发展各阶段的水平，领导儿童了解他们可能而又应该了解的东西，接受那些可能而又应该接受的影响，批评或抗拒那些可能而又应该批评或抗拒的影响。在这里的教育工作者底工作任务是愉快而光荣的，同时又是十分艰巨的，所需用的学识是广博而丰富湛深的。今天的教育工作者若是还沿用旧时的强迫命令，讥笑怒骂，甚至于乱整乱斗或体罚等等荒谬而笨拙的方法来对待儿童，那就不免太失策了。
    从以上简单的说明，可知我们教育工作的对象是各个具体的生气勃勃的新民主主义社会的儿童，将来要长成为社会主义社会的成员。他们每个人的发展都包含有各人的天资、禀赋、特征、知识和修养的总和，也含着各人在生活中所受到的一切社会、家庭、阶级、交游以及学校教育的影响，而我们的社会又正在逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，这里面是十分复杂的，而且也还是在变化着发展着的过程。因此，我们进行工作必须十分慎重，十分细心。以下要就我理解所及提出几点，以供参考：
    第一，要十分重视儿童健康：儿童正在发育，好比植物的嫩芽，前途的发展固然很大，而同时也是很容易受伤害的。这时期若得顺利地发育，便是一生的幸福；蒙受了伤残，便会耽误终身，甚至于夭折。例如儿童容易感受脑炎病，传染性的皮肤病，各种结核病，又容易弯腰驼背，脱臼折骨，扁桃腺肿大等等，这都是医学已经证明了的。学校里儿童集体地生活着，卫生环境若不好好地布置，传染病便容易发生或蔓延。学校体育是为得要帮助儿童身体发育，若竟然造成伤害，那就大违背了体育的本旨。课业负担过重，造成经常的过度疲劳，也是有损无益。对于儿童的健康，体育教师和校医固然直接负更多的责任，而校长、班主任、少年先锋队辅导员也必须经常地注意。家长也有责任随时向学校和团队提供意见。儿童期、少年期，少男和少女都各有其应特别注意的特点，决不可忽略。身心两方的发展是密切地相关着的，精神的刺激可以影响身体健康，而身体的变化也可以影响精神，这都必须细心处理。健康固然要积极地锻炼，以增加抵抗力，然也要恰如其分，过分夸张锻炼而不顾发育的条件，当然是有害的。
    第二，重视学习：上面说过，人类有特别长的儿童期，才能在社会文化的环境中得到发展，这是人类无穷地进步底一个原因。儿童在其发展的过程中学会了祖先所缔造的文化，掌握了人类社会的实践经验。他们学习使用他们周围的物质，掌握社会底物质的生产的基本方法。他们一步一步地进入社会关系日益广大的范围，了解这些关系而学会了和人们联系的各种行为方式。他们学会了语言，从而掌握人们所知道的周围世界的事物，领会人们怎样去想像它们，它们怎样被反应，怎样被认识。所以在儿童期，除健康第一之外，主要的任务是学习。也应该说，保卫健康，就为的是好好地学习。在资本主义社会，只知道使用儿童，剥削儿童的劳动力。他们为要更多地剥削儿童劳动，才给儿童们一点儿教育，这就是资本主义社会底义务教育底起源。我们人民的国家爱护儿童，要儿童好好地学习，以备将来长成后有效地为人民服务，因而在未成熟的儿童期，对他们的要求就以学习为主。学校的课外活动和少年先锋队的活动，其主要目的都还是学习。儿童们参加各种活动虽也可能对于公共卫生、公安、生产等方面作出一些惊人的贡献，但还是环绕着学习，主要目的还是为学习得更好，而工作成绩只是学习的副产物罢了。这是我们人民的国家在对待儿童方面大异乎资本主义社会之一点，应予注意。学习既然是儿童们的主要任务，我们布置儿童们的学习——课堂教学，课外活动和社团活动等——都必须适合他们身心发展的条件，才能使他们学习得更好，在他们现有的发展基础上得到更进一步的发展。这些学习活动倘若无益于儿童的发展，或者有害，那便是要不得的。所以一面要看需要，一面要看儿童发展条件之所及，即儿童主观的可能。如果不是儿童能力之所及，从他们主观方面说，便还不需要这种学习。因此，以教育成人的办法对待儿童，硬灌一些儿童所不了解的东西是不对的。然而儿童发展若达到了有某种学习的可能，而我们还不指导他们学习，不启发他们的学习兴趣，也是妨害了儿童生长。例如逻辑的思考，随着儿童年龄和智慧的发展，其可能性便逐步增加，因而系统的科学的学习便成为需要；倘若还藉口要等待儿童自发的兴趣，而不帮助他们动脑筋，也是不对的。所以布置一切学习活动都必须慎重地考虑儿童的年龄特点和个性特点。
    第三，要重视研究儿童发展的科学成果：关于儿童发展的研究，今天虽还算是后起的科学，还未十分成熟，然而在生理和心理方面，尤其是在儿童医学方面，也得到了一些可信的成果，这些成果可以帮助我们进行教育工作，值得重视。当然，很多目前现成的科学原理都还未能算是最后的定则，而还有批判发展的余地，何况后起的儿童教育底理论呢。然而一种理论若在实践上有了相当充足的论证，在未曾有更好的发现以前，就可以用作我们进行工作的指针，至少也可供重要的参考。我们要批判它，要修正它，也只有在实践上更深入地检查，发现更充足的论据，才有可能。换句话说，要批判现成的科学，只能凭借更高一步的科学。我们教育工作者若轻视现成的教育科学、儿童教育的理论，甚或只凭主观的臆测，或片断的经验类推，而抹煞现成的科学理论，以自夸创造，那将难免轻率误事。须知在生产工作上轻率从事会糟踏一些物质的资料，而在教育工作上轻率从事将会残害儿童的人格。苏联的教育理论是依据马克思列宁主义的观点和方法研究得来的，他们的论证是尽可能全面的，因而是值得我们学习的。学习苏联底先进的教育方法，必须注意他们那些方法所依据的科学理论，他们考虑所及的方面是很多的，包括着儿童生理的发展和心理的发展底各方面。如果我们只搬用一些苏联教育方法的形式，而忽略了其中丰富的理论研究，那将会是有形而无神。近来有些学校采用苏联“准备劳动与卫国”制的体育而结果失败，其原因就在此。我们教育工作者虽很难人人成为儿童研究的专家，但为着我们工作的需要，经常地留意学习有关的科学理论，是必需的。
    第四，深入地了解儿童：现代教育理论固然还未达到十分成熟的科学境界，即使今后更加进步发展，估计也不可能得到像工程学那样任便应用无讹的公式。这就因为工程学的对象是一些无生气的物质，而我们工作的对象是活的儿童。这里面包含着生理的变化，心理的变化，一切社会关系的历史文化的影响，以及今天以前儿童们所已接受的教育教养。由于这种发展过程是如此复杂丰富而变动不居，我们便不可能有何时何地都可通用的公式。往往一种教育方法对这个儿童有效，而对别一个就无效；同一个儿童今天适用这种方法，而到明天就未必适用。饶它是教育的验方，若运用起来，也还要存乎教育工作者的一心。我们教育工作者怎样能有如许玲珑的心呢？只凭着深入地了解。教育工作者的威信，就是你赢得孩子们的信服，你对他们才有权威，才能取得你所期待于他们的反应。所以你要热爱儿童，才能了解儿童。你了解他们越透彻，你便会更热爱他们。因而热爱和了解是互为因果，交互发展的。热爱决不是姑息，你严正地对待孩子，也该是从热爱出发，才可有效。往往有教师批评儿童的错误而儿童毫无所动于中，而换一位教师来，孩子却感动到呜咽流泪，这里的区别就是在热爱够不够。你发现孩子的优点，你固然爱他，你发现他的劣点，甚至于要惩诫他，也只有你对他更加热爱，你才能想尽方法，坚决地要他改正；给学生惩罚，也不是报复，乃是一种矫正手段，他也只有在受到你热爱的感动时，才翻然悔悟。教育工作者热爱自己的祖国，热爱世界上爱好和平的人类，因而热爱新的一代；为得更好地教育儿童，就热爱一切有关的科学，以求自己的工作做得更好，这叫做“教育爱”。你要培养孩子们的五爱品德，你自身就先要充满着教育爱。有所爱当然也有所恨，可是你能爱好的东西，才会恨坏的东西。你发现儿童的缺点，同时又晓得他有学好的可能性，因而你就会坚持要他改正，决不容许缺点永久留存。孩子们为什么容易犯错误呢？上面说过，儿童发展的过程是含有矛盾的，这矛盾现象在少年期的行动上表现得更显著。他们自身含有矛盾，而自己又还无力控制，因而易犯过失。教育工作者就必须根据孩子们的心理，扶植他们的优点，鼓励他们走上正确的道路，以克服那些缺点。在指导儿童生活上固应如此，就是指导学习作业上也应如此。学习作业的错误也往往是由于儿童有自己难于克服的矛盾，或是思维上的矛盾，或是注意集中和分散的矛盾，小学的儿童更不易自力克服，因而必须依靠老师热爱地正确地给以帮助。由此看来，指正孩子们学业的或行为的错误，都必须靠老师的热爱。倘若老师只会怒骂一顿或讥诮一番，都是有害而无益的。教育爱决不是一副单纯的软心肠，而是为着祖国的前途，为着孩子的前途，为着科学的真理，而不惮烦地寻觅最有效的教育方法，不达目的决不罢手。这里面含有大慈悲，也含有大智慧和大果断。所以说：最良的教育方法存在于最优的教育家人格之中。
    矛盾不只是存在于儿童生理的和心理的各种机能发展的过程中，而也有的是社会现实在儿童心里的反映。这种反映在童年期少有，而到少年期就有了，青年期会更多。例如少年青年时期的苦闷彷徨。青少年们和社会现实接触一天一天深入，知道的事情天天增多，他们就会发现那里有些矛盾，不易解释；又把社会现实和他们所学到的一些理论知识相对照，也会发现有不尽相符之处，因而怀疑，因而苦闷。这种青少年苦闷现象，资产阶级心理学者认为是青年们无可奈何的宿命，叫它做心理的危机。其实大谬不然。资本主义社会所有的不合理现象，在他们自身是无法解除的，他们也决不肯让青少年们晓得个中真相，因而只好听他们苦闷下去，直到向现实屈服为止。而在我们人民的社会，发现青少年们有这类疑问，正好是我们进行政治思想教育的良好条件。我们应该给青年们指明：这些不合理的现实，其中那些是旧社会留下来的残余，我们正在如何大力批判，进行清除；那些是过渡时期所不可避免的事实，这里那些还是好的一面，那些是坏的一面，应如何发展好的克服坏的。只要教育工作者透彻了解人民国家的方针政策，就青少年们理解力之所能及，恳切地指示他们以正确的解决途径，就可使他们释疑，把认识提高一步。他们认识了新社会不怕揭露错误，不怕暴露缺点，但有勇气去批判，有办法去克服，那还有甚么不可避免的苦闷危机呢？然而这样地进行政治思想教育，也决不同于和思想敌人作斗争。教育工作者决不该把自己和少年们对立起来，那怕他们的认识上存在着一些错误，也只应同情地扶植他们正确理解底要求，而克服那一面的误解。要说是斗争的话，也只能说帮助他们认识上进步的一面和落后的一面作斗争。硬搬“三反”、“五反”的形式来进行政治思想教育是不妥当的，不只是不能解决少年们苦闷，倒会更加深苦闷。
    教育工作者只要能深入地了解儿童，就会在儿童发展的过程中，看出活的生理学，活的心理学，活的政治经济学，活的社会史，从那里就会取得精良的教育理论和方法。那里的含义如此丰富，难道还不值得我们细心钻研吗？深入地了解儿童，也就是向儿童学习。我们的古训“教学相长”应作如是解。
    教育工作者同志们！我们必须遵照党和人民政府的指示，要儿童们身体好，学习好，工作好，大力完成祖国交托我们的光荣任务！
