Albania Advances in Victory
Chen Youwei

November 29th is one of the most significant days in the lives of the Albanian people—the day of liberation with the help of the Soviet army. Nine years ago, on this day, the Albanian people were forever freed from the rule of the fascist invaders and the feudal dynasty, and embarked on a bright path forward.

From the Sixteenth Century to the Twentieth Century

Before liberation, Albania, due to the oppression of imperialism and the long-term rule of feudalism, was in a very backward state in terms of politics, economy, and culture. When many countries in Europe entered the twentieth century with developed industries, this country on the Adriatic coast was still stuck in the era of the sixteenth century, without its own industry, not even a railway, and the majority of the population was illiterate.

After the Albanian people were liberated from reactionary rule, their most important task was to carry out economic construction, and to make the greatest efforts and the shortest time to make their country progress as quickly as possible. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Albanian people quickly restored and constructed the economy that had been destroyed by the war. After implementing a series of social reforms—nationalization of industry and land reform—Albania implemented a two-year plan starting in 1949. By 1951, industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level by more than five times. Since 1951, Albania has also started a five-year plan. By last year, the total industrial output had increased by six and a half times compared to the pre-war period, and the socialist component in industry had reached 99 percent. In agriculture, wheat harvests have increased by 120 percent compared to pre-war levels, rice by four times, and cotton by as much as seventy times. Now Albania has not only established its own industries—mining, textile, sugar-making, electricity and oil—but has also established a base for raw materials for its light industry (such as sugar beets and cotton, which were not produced before).

Years of large-scale construction have significantly changed the face of Albania. In Tirana and Elbasan, on the Adriatic coast and beside the rushing Mati River, new factories, new power stations, and new oil wells have been built everywhere. The newly built "Stalin Textile Factory" can produce 20 million square meters of fabrics annually. Several newly built railways connect the central cities of the country. Hundreds of kilometers of new roads have been built in the high mountains. Hundreds of new schools have been opened in formerly poor and remote areas. The material life of the working people is improving day by day. Now Albania's industrial supply of shoes, socks, and clothing to the national residents is twice that of the pre-war period, and food is six times that of the pre-war period. Cultural undertakings have also developed rapidly. The number of middle schools and primary schools has increased several times, and from formerly having no universities, there are now five. Illiteracy is being rapidly eliminated. Women have gained the same rights as men in all aspects.

The road that the Albanian people have experienced in the past few years is a road from the sixteenth century to the twentieth century, a road shining with the brilliance of the superiority of the people's democratic system.

Standing Tall Like Granite

Unlike other people's democratic countries in Europe, Albania is completely surrounded by hostile countries. The royalist fascist Greece and Tito's Yugoslavia, supported and directed by U.S. imperialism, have never ceased their provocations against it for several years. These lackeys of U.S. imperialism frequently violate its borders, airdrop agents, and carry out sabotage. In the past year alone, there have been more than 180 border provocation incidents. Due to the systematic dispatch of agents by the Tito clique to infiltrate Albania to carry out assassination and sabotage, Albania's economic construction suffered serious losses in 1949. However, the Albanian Labor Party and the government were vigilant in time and took effective measures to eliminate spies and saboteurs, making the internal situation even more consolidated. As the Albanian people's leader Enver Hoxha pointed out: "The new Albania stands tall, and will stand as invulnerable as a granite cliff."

The reason why the Albanian people are invincible is not only because of their unity and strong resilience, but also because they have the full support of the 800 million people of the entire peace and democracy camp. Even if Albania is surrounded by enemies today, it is still an inseparable part of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. Albania's construction in the past few years has been supported by the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union not only supplied Albania with complete sets of machinery and equipment for electricity, mining, kerosene, textiles, sugar-making, and other industries, enabling it to establish its own industry, transform its old industry, develop transportation, and increase agricultural production, but also provided comprehensive and important assistance in technology. Albania also received mining equipment, locomotives, electrical appliances, transportation equipment, and other materials from European people's democratic countries. The selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries has guaranteed the smooth progress and rapid upsurge of Albania's economic construction, becoming an important factor in the great achievements of the Albanian people.

Advancing Towards Socialism

With the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the Albanian people are today victoriously advancing towards socialism. The aim of the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) adopted by the Albanian People's Assembly in May 1952 is to create conditions for the implementation of socialism. The basic tasks of this plan in the political aspect are: to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the leadership role of the working class in this alliance, restrict capitalist speculative elements in urban and rural areas, improve the cultural level of the working people, and promote the socialist consciousness of the working class and the revolutionary vigilance and patriotism of the working people. The basic tasks in the economic aspect are: to establish the socialist economic foundation at a faster rate, so that Albania will be transformed from a backward agricultural country into a country with well-developed industry and agriculture by the end of the Five-Year Plan.

During the Five-Year Plan period, the total investment in the national economy will reach 21 billion lek (Albanian currency), an increase of two times compared with the total investment from 1946 to 1950. By 1955, industrial production will exceed the pre-war level by twelve times. The railway and highway networks will also be further expanded, and major ports will be mechanized. In agriculture, a large number of water conservancy projects will be built, and the area of cultivated land will be greatly expanded. By 1955, agricultural production will be equal to twice the pre-war level. The proportion of industry in the national economy will increase from 18.3 percent before the war to 55 percent. The Five-Year Plan bill also reflects the great concern of the Albanian Labor Party and the People's Government for the welfare of the working people. The total wages of workers will increase by 215 percent compared to before. The people of the whole country will receive 50 to 100 percent more food and consumer goods in 1955 than before. Cultural and artistic undertakings will also achieve great development. Undoubtedly, the completion of the Five-Year Plan will enable the Albanian people to take a big step forward on the road to socialism.

Recently, Albania has taken some measures to improve national work, further develop the national economy and improve people's living standards, namely, reorganizing and streamlining the central institutions of the government, striving to expand the food industry, increasing agricultural investment, raising the purchasing prices of agricultural products, reducing the amount of agricultural products delivered and sold, and exempting farmers from outstanding tax arrears. The implementation of these measures will ensure the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the smooth progress of socialist construction.

From the actual life and personal experience of the past nine years since liberation, the Albanian people have deeply realized that the road they have taken is correct, so they spare no effort to strengthen their country, strengthen their friendship with the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and constantly maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemies of peace. Under the favorable situation of the rapid growth of the entire peace and democracy camp, the Albanian people are holding high the banner of fighting for peace and socialism, and are advancing courageously in victory.

    阿尔巴尼亚在胜利中前进
    陈有为
    十一月二十九日，是阿尔巴尼亚人民生活中的一个最有意义的日子——在苏军帮助下获得解放的日子。九年前的这一天，阿尔巴尼亚人民便永远摆脱了法西斯侵略者和封建王朝的统治，走上了光明的前进道路。
    从十六世纪跃进到二十世纪
    阿尔巴尼亚在解放以前，由于帝国主义的压迫和封建主义的长期统治，使得它在政治、经济和文化上都处于十分落后的境地。当欧洲许多国家以发达的工业进入二十世纪的时候，这个位于亚得里亚海畔的国家却还一直停留在十六世纪的时代，没有本国的工业，甚至没有一条自己的铁路，全国居民大部分都是文盲。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从反动统治下解放出来后，他们最重要的任务就是要进行经济建设，要以最大的努力和最短的时间来使自己的国家得到最快的进步。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下和苏联无私的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚人民很快地就恢复了被战争所破坏的经济和建设。在实行了一系列的社会改革——工业国有化与土地改革后，阿尔巴尼亚就从一九四九年起实行了一个两年计划，一九五一年的工业生产量已超过战前水平的五倍以上。自一九五一年起，阿尔巴尼亚又开始实行五年计划。到去年，工业总产量已比战前增加了六倍半，工业中的社会主义成分已达到了百分之九十九。在农业方面，小麦收获量比战前增加百分之一百二十，大米为战前的四倍，而棉花则更高达七十倍。现在阿尔巴尼亚不仅已经建立起了他们自己的工业——采矿、纺织、制糖、电力与石油，而且还为自己的轻工业建立了原料（如从前不出产的甜菜与棉花）的基地。
    几年来的大规模建设，已经显著地改变了阿尔巴尼亚的面貌。在地拉那和爱尔巴桑，在亚得里亚海畔和湍急的麦蒂河旁，到处都建起了新的工厂，新的发电站和新的油井。新建的“斯大林纺织工厂”可以年产织品二千万平方公尺。几条新修建起来的铁路，连接了国内的中心城市。在高山峻岭间辟设了数百公里的新公路。在从前的穷乡僻壤里开办了几百所新学校。劳动人民的物质生活正在一天比一天改善，现在阿尔巴尼亚工业供应给全国居民的鞋袜衣着已等于战前的两倍，食品等于战前的六倍。文化事业也有了迅速的发展。中学和小学的数目增加了好几倍，从前没有高等学校，现在已经有五所了。文盲正在迅速扫除中。妇女们在各方面已获得了和男子同样的权利。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民几年来所经历的道路，就是一条从十六世纪跃进到二十世纪的道路，一条闪耀着人民民主制度优越性的光辉的道路。
    像花岗石般地巍然屹立着
    和欧洲别的人民民主国家不同，阿尔巴尼亚是完全处在敌对国家的包围之中的。在美帝国主义支持和指使下的保皇法西斯希腊、铁托南斯拉夫几年来一直没有停止过对它的挑衅。这些美帝国主义的爪牙经常侵犯它的边境，空投特务，进行破坏。仅最近的一年内，就发生过一百八十多次边境挑衅事件。由于铁托集团有计划地派遣特务打入阿尔巴尼亚内部进行暗害和破坏，阿尔巴尼亚的经济建设在一九四九年曾受到严重的损失。但阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府及时警惕并采取了有效措施，清除了奸细和破坏分子，使得内部更加巩固。正如阿尔巴尼亚的人民领袖恩维尔·霍查所指出的：“新的阿尔巴尼亚屹立着，而且将像一座不可侵犯的花岗石的悬崖一样地巍然屹立着。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民之所以是不可战胜的，不仅因为他们的团结一致与坚强刚毅，而且还因为他们有着整个和平民主阵营的八亿人民的全力支持。即使阿尔巴尼亚今天处在敌人的包围之中，它也仍然是和平民主与社会主义阵营的不可分割的一部分。阿尔巴尼亚这几年来的建设，一直受到苏联和各人民民主国家的援助。苏联不仅以整套的电力、采矿、煤油、纺织、制糖等工业的机器装备与其他物资供给阿尔巴尼亚，使它能够建立起自己的工业，改造旧有工业，发展交通运输，提高农业生产，而且还在技术上提供了全面的重要的帮助。阿尔巴尼亚同时也从欧洲人民民主国家得到采矿设备、机车、电器用品、运输工具等物资。苏联和人民民主国家的无私帮助，保证了阿尔巴尼亚经济建设的顺利进行和迅速高涨，而成为阿尔巴尼亚人民取得巨大成就的重要因素。
      向社会主义前进
    在苏联和各人民民主国家的援助之下，阿尔巴尼亚人民今天正在胜利地向社会主义迈进。阿尔巴尼亚人民议会在一九五二年五月所通过的五年计划（一九五一——一九五五年）的目的，就是要为实行社会主义创造条件。这个计划在政治方面的基本任务是：巩固工农联盟，加强工人阶级在这个联盟中的领导作用，限制城乡资本主义投机成分，提高劳动人民的文化水平，发扬工人阶级的社会主义觉悟和劳动人民的革命警惕性与爱国主义精神。在经济方面的基本任务是：以更高的速度建立社会主义的经济基础，使阿尔巴尼亚在五年计划终了时，从一个落后的农业国变为工业农业都很发达的国家。
    在五年计划时期，国民经济方面的投资总额将达二百一十亿里克（阿币），比一九四六年到一九五○年投资总额增加两倍。到一九五五年时，工业生产量将超过战前水平的十二倍。铁路与公路网也要进一步扩大，主要港口将实行机械化。在农业方面，将大量兴修水利，大大扩大耕地面积。到一九五五年时，农业生产将等于战前的两倍。工业在国民经济中的比重，将从战前的百分之十八点三增加到百分之五十五。五年计划法案同时也反映出了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民政府对劳动人民福利的巨大关怀。工人的工资总额将较前增加百分之二百十五。全国人民在一九五五年将得到比从前多一半到一倍的食品和消费品。文化艺术事业也将获得很大的发展。无疑的，五年计划的完成，将使阿尔巴尼亚人民在走向社会主义的道路上大大地迈进一步。
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚为了改进国家工作、进一步发展国民经济与提高人民生活水平采取了一些措施，即改组与精简政府的中央机构，努力扩充食品工业，增加农业投资，提高农产品收购价格，减低农产品的交售量和豁免农民积欠税款尾数等。这些措施的实行，将保证工农联盟的进一步巩固和社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从获得解放以后九年来的实际生活与亲身体验中，深深地认识到他们所走的道路是正确的，因而不遗余力地来加强自己的国家，加强和伟大苏联与各人民民主国家的友谊，并经常地保持着对于和平敌人的高度警惕。在整个和平民主阵营力量迅速壮大的有利形势下，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在高举着为和平与社会主义事业而斗争的旗帜，在胜利中奋勇前进。
