[Report from this newspaper] All regions across the country are actively preparing to utilize the slack season this winter and next spring to vigorously construct small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, creating favorable conditions for increasing the production of grain and cotton next year.

With the arrival of the slack season, various regions have learned from the lessons of drought and waterlogging this summer and autumn and are making early preparations for farmland water conservancy construction. Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, as well as the Northwest region, issued notices or instructions in October, requiring all localities to formulate plans for farmland water conservancy construction based on the needs and possibilities of developing agricultural production, propose engineering goals, and organize and lead mass water conservancy movements. These notices or instructions require that in areas with poor water conservancy conditions or few small-scale water conservancy projects, the masses should be organized to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy projects; in areas where small-scale water conservancy projects have already developed, the original projects should be inspected and repaired, and complacency about "having reached the peak in water conservancy construction" should be prevented, continuing to build water conservancy projects in a planned way and strengthening maintenance work. Currently, many regions have made specific arrangements for farmland water conservancy construction. The Yuexi District of Guangdong Province plans to build more than 4,400 medium and small-scale water conservancy projects this winter and next spring. When these projects are completed, 1.3 million mu of farmland will benefit. In order to ensure the smooth progress of these projects and guarantee their quality, the Yuexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all counties to assign a county committee member to be specifically responsible for leading water conservancy work. Hunan Province plans to conduct widespread dike drilling work in the Dongting Lake area; vigorously carry out mass farmland water conservancy construction in mountainous and hilly areas, and invest in helping farmers build more than 3,200 new ponds and dams and many valley reservoirs. Anhui Province plans to carry out pond and dam construction projects focusing on drought prevention in the Huainan and Jiangnan hilly areas, and projects focusing on flood prevention along the Yangtze River to reinforce inner embankments and consolidate river dikes, with projects combining flood and drought prevention in mountainous areas. Preliminary plans call for a total of 50 to 60 million cubic meters of earthwork to be done throughout the province. These projects can prevent more than 1.4 million mu of paddy fields in the province from being affected by disasters in this year's drought and flood conditions. Yunnan Province has already made arrangements for farmland water conservancy construction, requiring all localities to actively and steadily develop medium and small-scale water conservancy projects and actively store water on the basis of consolidating existing projects, in preparation for spring planting next year. Gansu Province plans to assist farmers in handling less technically demanding farmland water conservancy projects with work relief this winter and next spring. In addition, parts of Hubei Province and Rehe Province have also drawn up plans for farmland water conservancy construction.

In order to strengthen technical guidance for the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, many regions have held water conservancy technology seminars and water conservancy technology training courses. Guangdong Province has selected thirteen counties, including Wuhua, Jieyang, Qujiang, and Haifeng, to run training courses, training active peasant elements, experienced farmers, and some township and village cadres with experience in farmland water conservancy construction, so that they can initially learn the technical knowledge of constructing small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in order to return and lead peasants in construction work. In October, the Minhou Special District of Fujian Province held a symposium that included folk technical representatives with experience in water conservancy projects such as gate building, dam building, well digging, and canal opening, as well as water conservancy cadres at all levels, to exchange experiences and clarify the guiding principles for constructing small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Zhejiang Province has also notified all localities to run water conservancy technology training courses and hold water conservancy conferences on a county basis. Each special district and county in Hunan Province is running short-term water conservancy training courses. The Changde Special District plans to train 3,000 rural cadres and production activists to participate in water conservancy work. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region has opened nine short-term water conservancy training courses, with nearly 2,000 people participating in the study.

Currently, people's governments at all levels in all regions are vigorously supporting and specifically helping farmers in various regions to construct farmland water conservancy. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government has allocated 50 billion yuan in construction funds to invest in farmland water conservancy construction, and in mid-October, it sent more than 200 technical cadres and staff members to eastern Guangdong, central Guangdong, western Guangdong, northern Guangdong, and Hainan Island to assist farmers in various regions in constructing small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. As early as mid-August, the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang Province dispatched water conservancy work cadres from ten counties, including Lanxi and Shouchang, to form work groups and survey larger water conservancy projects in ten counties. The Central Ministry of Water Conservancy has successively sent water conservancy work teams to Guangdong, Fujian, Gansu, and other provinces to assist local areas in carrying out farmland water conservancy construction.

    利用农闲季节为明年增产粮棉创造条件
    各地积极准备兴修农田水利工程
   【本报讯】全国各地积极准备利用今冬明春农闲季节，大力兴修小型农田水利，为明年增产粮食、棉花创造有利的条件。
    农闲季节已经到来，各地接受了今年夏秋干旱、内涝的教训，对兴修农田水利的工作，正提前进行准备。广东、浙江两省和西北区在十月份已先后发出通知或指示，要求各地根据发展农业生产的需要和可能，订好兴修农田水利的计划，提出工程目标，有组织有领导地开展群众性的兴修水利运动。这些通知或指示中要求：在有水利条件或小型水利工程少的地区，应组织群众大力兴修小型水利工程；在小型水利工程已有发展的地区，应检查和整修原有工程，并要防止“水利已经修到顶”的自满情绪，继续有计划地兴修水利和加强护理工作。现在，许多地区对兴修农田水利工作，已作了具体安排。广东省粤西区计划在今冬明春兴建四千四百多起中、小型水利工程。这些工程完成后，可使一百三十万亩农田受益。中共粤西区委会为保证这些工程的顺利进行和保证工程质量，已指示各县要有一个县委委员专责领导水利工作。湖南省计划在洞庭湖滨地区普遍进行堤岸钻探工作；在山区和丘陵地区大力开展群众性的兴修农田水利工作，并投资帮助农民新修三千二百多处塘坝和许多山谷水库。安徽省计划在淮南、江南丘陵地带开展以防旱为主的修塘筑坝工程，在长江沿岸进行以防涝为主的加修内圩巩固江堤的工程，山区做防洪、防旱兼备的工程。初步计划，全省共须做土方工程五千万到六千万公方。这些工程可使全省一百四十多万亩水稻田在今年这样旱涝情况下不致成灾。云南省已对兴修农田水利工作作了布置，要求各地在整顿原有工程的基础上，积极稳步地发展中、小型水利工程和积极蓄水，准备明年春播。甘肃省计划在今冬明春以工代赈协助农民办理技术性较低的农田水利工程。此外，湖北省和热河省部分地区也订出了兴修农田水利的计划。
    为了加强对今冬明春兴修小型农田水利工程的技术指导，不少地区召开了水利技术座谈会和举办了水利技术训练班。广东省已选定在五华、揭阳、曲江、海丰等十三县开办训练班，训练有兴修农田水利工程经验的农民积极分子、老农和部分乡、村干部，使他们初步学会兴修小型农田水利工程的技术常识，以便回去领导农民进行兴建工作。福建省闽侯专区在十月间召开了一次包括有建闸、建坝、凿井、开渠等水利工程经验的民间技术代表和各级水利干部参加的座谈会，交流了经验和明确了兴修小型农田水利的方针。浙江省农林厅也已通知各地，以县为单位办好水利技术训练班，开好水利会议。湖南省各专区和县都在开办短期水利训练班。常德专区计划训练三千个乡村干部和生产积极分子参加水利工作。湘西苗族自治区已开办九个短期水利训练班，有近二千人参加学习。
    现在，各地各级人民政府正在大力支持并具体帮助各地农民兴修农田水利。广东省人民政府已拨出五百亿元建设资金投资于农田水利建设，又在十月中旬派出技术干部和工作人员二百多人，分别到粤东、粤中、粤西、粤北和海南岛，协助各地农民兴修小型农田水利工程。浙江省金华专区早在八月中旬就由专署抽调了兰溪、寿昌等十县的水利工作干部，组织工作组，查勘了十个县中的较大的水利工程。中央水利部已先后派出水利工作队到广东、福建、甘肃等省，协助当地开展兴修农田水利的工作。
