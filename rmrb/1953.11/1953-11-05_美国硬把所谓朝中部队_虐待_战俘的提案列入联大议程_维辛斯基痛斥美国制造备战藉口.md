Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on November 2nd to discuss the request made by the United States delegation to include the so-called "Atrocities Committed Against United Nations Prisoners of War by North Korean and Chinese Communist Forces" on the agenda of the Eighth General Assembly.

At the beginning of the discussion, the President of the General Assembly, Mrs. Pandit, asked the representatives present to handle this matter in a spirit of moderation.

Ignoring this request, U.S. Representative Lodge vehemently slandered the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to justify the U.S. request.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke. He pointed out that the U.S. delegation's proposal at this time was for a very obvious purpose: to create new disputes on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The most reactionary groups in the United States are sparing no effort to obstruct the work aimed at achieving peace in Korea and the Far East, hindering the strengthening of international cooperation and the relaxation of international tensions.

Vyshinsky said: To implement this provocative plan, they have found a new pretext. They have made false accusations of so-called "atrocities" against prisoners of war in Korea, and even put forward the number of American prisoners of war allegedly killed or starved to death in Korea as 6,113. In this regard, it is worth noting that in 1951, Colonel Hanley, the Chief of Military Justice of the U.S. Eighth Army, issued a similar statement. This statement later proved to be fabricated, one of its purposes being to create pretexts for delaying the Korean negotiations that were underway at that time. In his report two years ago, Hanley also put forward the number of prisoners of war allegedly killed by the Chinese and Korean troops. The figure put forward by Hanley in 1951 was 6,100, which is not much different from the figure put forward by the U.S. delegation today two years later (6,113). This shows that what the U.S. delegation is saying now is just repeating Colonel Hanley's slanders and provocations. At that time, Ridgway issued a statement on Hanley's report, saying that the facts and nature of each prisoner of war's death could not be determined. Ridgway expressed regret over Hanley's report on the so-called atrocities, and also expressed regret that Hanley had not consulted with his command before publishing this information.

Vyshinsky said: The so-called atrocities issue now raised by the U.S. representative is just an episode of the "Cold War," and it pursues the same goals as the "Cold War" has always pursued. U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens' report unequivocally reveals this point. His report states that the descriptions of torture and massacres carried out by North Korean and Chinese troops in Korea are the best answer to all those who doubt whether the United States needs a strong military defense force. Stevens also said that all these facts prove that the United States cannot relax its defense work. Vyshinsky pointed out that the U.S. delegation submitted this issue to the General Assembly for discussion in order to promote the arms race movement and strengthen war psychology.

Vyshinsky further said: Undoubtedly, all these accusations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China are for one purpose: to divert the attention of the world's public from the war crimes committed by the U.S. military in Korea, especially the massacres in the prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island, Busan, and Geoje Island last December and before. According to the materials published by the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the International Committee of the Red Cross, 3,059 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were killed or injured at that time. This is only the figure after the start of the armistice negotiations. In fact, the number of prisoners of war killed and injured is much higher than this figure. From February 23, 1952, to January 1, 1953, General Nam Il successively submitted 45 protests to General Harrison, the head of the United Nations Command delegation, protesting against the so-called continuous crimes of the United Nations Command.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation firmly demanded that the U.S. request be condemned as false, slanderous, and provocative.

Mexican Representative Colina expressed doubts as to whether the U.S. delegation's presentation of this issue was timely and appropriate. He pointed out that the negotiations on convening a Korean political conference currently being held in Panmunjom have encountered difficulties. He worried that discussing this issue would make the negotiations even more difficult or cause the resumption of hostilities in Korea. He said that it is necessary to avoid anything that might overturn the precarious peace situation in Korea. However, he also said that since the rules of procedure do not prohibit the issue from being raised, he will vote in favor of the U.S. request.

Polish Representative Katz-Suchy opposed including the issue raised by the U.S. delegation on the agenda. He said that the reason why the U.S. delegation is forcing the General Assembly to discuss this issue is to undermine efforts to further ease international tensions and efforts to convene a Korean political conference.

The General Committee passed the U.S. delegation's proposal. The Soviet and Polish representatives voted against it. The committee also decided, based on the British representative's proposal, to submit the U.S. proposal to the plenary session of the General Assembly for discussion without submitting it to any committee. The Soviet and Polish representatives announced their opposition to any institution of the General Assembly studying the issue raised by the U.S. delegation.

    美国硬把所谓朝中部队“虐待”战俘的提案列入联大议程
    维辛斯基痛斥美国制造备战藉口
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会于十一月二日举行会议，讨论美国代表团提出的要求，它要求把所谓“北朝鲜和中国共产党部队对朝鲜联合国军战俘施行的暴行问题”列入第八届大会议程。
    在讨论开始时，大会主席潘迪特夫人要求与会代表以和缓的精神来处理这件事情。
    美国代表洛奇对这个要求置若罔闻，他对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国大肆诽谤，来为美国的要求辩护。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言。他指出，美国代表团在这个时候提出这个要求是为了达到一个十分明显的目的：在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上制造新的纠纷。美国最反动的集团正不遗余力地阻挠以实现朝鲜和远东的和平为目的的工作，阻挠国际合作的加强和国际紧张局势的缓和。
    维辛斯基说：为了实行这种挑衅计划，他们找出了一个新藉口。他们提出了所谓在朝鲜的战俘受到“暴行”的诬蔑性控诉，甚至提出了所谓在朝鲜被杀害或饿死的美国战俘的人数有六千一百一十三名。在这方面，值得注意的是：在一九五一年，美国第八军军法处处长汉莱上校曾发表一篇类似的声明。这篇声明后来证明是胡诌出来的，其目的之一是为拖延当时正在进行的朝鲜谈判制造藉口。汉莱在他两年前的那个报告中也提出所谓被中朝部队杀害了的战俘数字。汉莱在一九五一年提出的数字是六千一百人，与美国代表团在两年后的今天提出的数字（六千一百一十三人）相差无几。这说明美国代表团现在所说的话只是重复汉莱上校的诬蔑和挑衅的话而已。当时李奇微对汉莱的报告曾经发表声明说，每个战俘死亡的事实和性质都不能够确定。李奇微对汉莱发表关于所谓暴行的报告曾表示遗憾，也曾对汉莱没有和他的司令部商议就发表这些情报的举动表示遗憾。
    维辛斯基说：美国代表现在所提出的所谓暴行问题，只不过是“冷战”的一个插曲，它所追求的目的和“冷战”所一向追求的目的相同。美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯的报告毫不含糊地透露了这点。他的报告说，关于北朝鲜和中国军队在朝鲜进行拷问和屠杀的描写，就是对一切怀疑美国是否需要强大的军事防御力量的人们的最好的回答。斯蒂文斯又说，所有这些事实证明美国不能放松防御工作。维辛斯基指出，美国代表团把这个问题提交大会讨论，就是为了促进扩军备战运动并加强战争心理。
    维辛斯基进一步说：无疑，所有这些对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的诬告，都是为了一个目的：转移全世界公众对美军在朝鲜所犯的战争罪行的注意，特别是对于去年十二月和在这以前在济州岛、釜山和巨济岛战俘营的大屠杀的注意。根据朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部及红十字国际委员会所发表的材料，那时有三千零五十九名北朝鲜和中国战俘被杀或受伤。这仅仅是停战谈判开始以后的数字。实际上，被杀害和受伤的战俘的数目要大大超过这一数字。从一九五二年二月二十三日到一九五三年一月一日，南日大将曾先后把四十五份抗议书交给联合国军代表团团长、美国的哈利逊将军，抗议所谓联合国军的连续不断的罪行。
    维辛斯基说，苏联代表团坚决要求：谴责美国的要求是虚伪的、诬蔑的和挑衅的。
    墨西哥代表柯林纳对美国代表团提出这个问题是否适时与是否恰当表示怀疑。他指出，目前在板门店举行的关于召开朝鲜政治会议的谈判遭到了困难。他担心讨论这个问题会使谈判更加困难，或使朝鲜敌对行动再起。他说，目前必须避免任何可能推翻朝鲜的岌岌可危的和平局面的事情。不过他又说，由于程序规则并不禁止这个问题的提出，他将投票赞成美国的要求。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希反对将美国代表团提出的问题列入议程。他说，美国代表团所以要强使大会讨论这个问题，是为了破坏进一步缓和国际紧张局势的努力，破坏召开朝鲜政治会议的努力。
    总务委员会通过美国代表团的建议。苏联和波兰代表投反对票。委员会并根据英国代表的提议，决定将美国建议不提交任何委员会而提交大会全体会议讨论。苏联与波兰代表宣布反对由大会的任何机构来研究美国代表团所提出的这个问题。
