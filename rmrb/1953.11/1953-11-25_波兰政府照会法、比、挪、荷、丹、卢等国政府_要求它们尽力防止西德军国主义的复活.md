Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 23rd: According to TASS, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, Stanisław Skrzeszewski, received the French Ambassador, the Belgian and Norwegian Ministers, and the Dutch and Danish Chargé d'affaires on November 19th, and handed them identical notes. A similar note was also sent to the Government of Luxembourg. The Polish Foreign Minister also received the Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic, informed him of this diplomatic step, and gave him a copy of the note.

The note to the French Government stated: Out of concern for the security of Poland, the Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that the guarantee of security for the people of Europe depends primarily on whether there is genuine progress in easing international tension, and on the respective attitudes of all countries concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe. The Government of the Polish People's Republic has been paying the closest attention to the notes exchanged between the Soviet Government and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the measures taken by these governments in Europe in recent years. The Polish people, having learned a painful lesson from the last war, attach particular importance to the German question. The proper resolution of this issue is undoubtedly a fundamental key to European peace and security.

The note pointed out: The policy adopted by those aggressors who want to establish world hegemony aims to turn West Germany into the arsenal and assault force of this policy, thereby completely dominating Europe and making a new Hitlerite Germany the master of this Europe. This is the basic reason for the conclusion of the Bonn Treaty and the European Defense Community Treaty. Bonn government figures are trying to get the Bonn and Paris Treaties ratified in order to accelerate the establishment of a German aggressive army, thereby blocking the road to the conclusion of a peace treaty. Obviously, separate treaties do not provide any guarantee against the threat of German militarism. Only through a consensus agreement among the Four Powers based on the Potsdam Agreement can this threat be eliminated.

The note continued: The remilitarization of West Germany, and any measures that promote the remilitarization of West Germany, violate the interests of all of Germany's neighbors.

The people of Europe, especially Germany's neighbors, have the right to hope that their victory over Hitlerism, bought at a great sacrifice, will help to establish a peace-loving Germany; they have the right to hope that Germany's revanchist plans will no longer undermine relations between European countries. Peaceful coexistence between Germany and its neighbors is possible, as demonstrated by the good neighborly and friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. The Soviet proposal for a draft peace treaty with Germany provides the possibility for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, democratic Germany, for the relaxation of international tensions, and for peaceful coexistence between countries.

The note concluded: The Polish Government firmly demands that all of Germany's neighbors relentlessly prevent the revival of German imperialism and militarism. The Polish Government hopes that the French Government will remember the close friendship between our peoples and accept this request with full understanding. The Polish Government believes that the relaxation of international tensions and the appropriate and permanent resolution of the German question can only be achieved through consultations between the major powers. Therefore, the Polish Government supports the Soviet Government's proposal in its note of November 3, 1953, regarding the convening of a foreign ministers' conference, and requests that the French Government also support this proposal.

    波兰政府照会法、比、挪、荷、丹、卢等国政府  
    要求它们尽力防止西德军国主义的复活
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社华沙二十二日讯：波兰人民共和国外交部部长斯坦尼斯瓦夫·斯克热歇夫斯基，于十一月十九日先后接见了法国大使、比利时与挪威公使、荷兰与丹麦代办；并分别交给他们内容相同的照会一份。同样照会一份亦已送交卢森堡政府。波兰外交部部长还接见了捷克斯洛伐克共和国大使，告诉他此项外交步骤，并交给他照会副本一件。
    致法国政府的照会说：出于对波兰安全的考虑，波兰人民共和国政府认为，欧洲各国人民对安全的保障，首先决定于缓和国际紧张局势是否有真正的进展，决定于所有关心维持并巩固欧洲和平的国家各自的态度。波兰人民共和国政府最密切地注意到苏联政府与美、英、法政府之间所交换的照会，以及这些政府近年来在欧洲所采取的措施。波兰人民自上次战争中获得惨痛的教训，他们特别重视德国问题。这个问题的适当解决，无疑的是欧洲和平与安全的基本关键。
    照会指出：那些想建立世界霸权的侵略分子所采取的政策，目的在于把西德变成这个政策的兵工厂与突击队，从而完全支配欧洲，使一个新希特勒德国成为这个欧洲的主宰。这就是缔结波恩条约和欧洲防务集团条约的基本原因。波恩政府人士力图使波恩与巴黎条约得到批准，以加紧建立德国侵略军，从而堵塞缔结和约的道路。显然，单独条约对免受德国军国主义威胁，没有给予任何保证。只有根据波茨坦协定，四大国达成一致协议，才能消除这种威胁。
    照会接着说：使西德重新军国主义化以及促成西德重新军国主义化的任何措施，违反了德国所有邻国的利益。
    欧洲人民，尤其是德国的邻国有权利希望，他们以重大牺牲换来的对希特勒主义的胜利将帮助成立一个爱好和平的德国；有权利希望德国的复仇主义计划再不能破坏欧洲各国的关系。德国与邻国和平共处是可能的，德意志民主共和国和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国之间的睦邻友好关系证明了这一点。苏联提出的对德和约草案，为成立一个统一的、爱好和平的民主德国、为缓和国际紧张局势与各国和平共处提供了可能性。
    照会最后说：波兰政府坚决要求德国的所有邻国丝毫不懈地防止德国帝国主义和军国主义的复活。波兰政府希望法国政府记住我们人民之间的密切友谊，怀着充分了解的心情接受这个要求。波兰政府认为，国际紧张局势的缓和以及德国问题适当和永久的解决，只有通过大国协商才能实现。所以，波兰政府支持苏联政府在一九五三年十一月三日的照会中所提出的关于召开外长会议的建议，并要求法国政府也支持这个建议。
