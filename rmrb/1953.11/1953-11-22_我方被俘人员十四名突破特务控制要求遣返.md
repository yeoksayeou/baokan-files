    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 21st: Just as the explanation work was continuing to stall due to the U.S. side directing Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission notified the Korean-Chinese side on the evening of the 21st that fourteen more Korean-Chinese prisoners of war had broken through special agent control and demanded repatriation. They will be returned to Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. on the 22nd.
    Despite the U.S. side instructing the Syngman Rhee-Chiang Kai-shek special agents to use every possible means of terror to control the prisoners of war, our captured personnel are still constantly risking their lives to escape the camps and demand repatriation. This has caused the U.S. side's lie that prisoners of war "would rather die than be repatriated" to be shattered again and again in front of the world. To date, the number of our captured personnel demanding repatriation without explanation has reached 199, and adding the 70 who have returned after explanation, a total of 269 of our captured personnel have escaped special agent control and returned. Each of them is a witness to the failure of the U.S. plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    我方被俘人员十四名突破特务控制要求遣返
    【新华社开城二十一日电】正当解释工作由于美方指挥蒋匪特务阻止战俘出营场而继续陷于停顿的时候，中立国遣返委员会二十一日晚通知朝中方面：又有十四名朝中被俘人员突破特务控制要求遣返，他们将在二十二日上午十一时被送回板门店。
    尽管美方指使李蒋特务想尽办法使用各种恐怖手段控制战俘，但是我方被俘人员还是不断地冒着生命危险逃出营场要求遣返。这使得美方所谓战俘“宁死也不愿遣返”的谎言在全世界面前遭到一次又一次的破产。迄今为止，未经解释要求遣返的我方被俘人员已达一百九十九人，加上经过解释遣返归来的七十名，一共有二百六十九名我方被俘人员已经逃脱特务控制遣返归来，他们每一个人都是美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋遭到失败的证人。
