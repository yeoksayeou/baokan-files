    The CCP Henan Qi County Committee held an enlarged meeting of county, district, and township-level cadres in late October. According to the spirit of the general line and general tasks, the meeting examined and summarized the work of this year, criticized errors and shortcomings in the work, and initially determined the county's plan for increasing production and practicing economy.

    The meeting first criticized the one-sided peasant viewpoint among cadres and established the concept of the state and the worker-peasant alliance. The meeting believed that there was a widespread view, from within the Party to outside the Party, that the interests of peasants were opposed to the interests of the state, especially the serious phenomenon of a small number of Party member cadres acting selfishly and harming the interests of the state. For example, Wang Hongshui, the head of Wangdui Township, had dozens of shi of wheat stored at home, but during the summer grain requisition, he used the excuse of being affected by disaster to avoid paying public grain. In addition, he adopted an attitude of managing loans but not collecting them with respect to state loans to farmers. The meeting criticized this erroneous thinking and clearly pointed out that in the past four years, due to economic recovery and development, the prices of industrial products have been decreasing daily, and people have been able to buy inexpensive means of production and means of livelihood. This fully demonstrates that during the transition period of realizing socialist industrialization and implementing socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, the state is gradually raising the material and cultural living standards of the people (naturally including the peasants, who constitute the majority of the national population) on the basis of developing production. After clearly recognizing that national industrialization is the highest interest of the entire Party and all the people, the cadres attending the meeting all stated that they would return to their villages to carry out mutual aid and cooperation movements, do a good job in production, produce more grain, and educate the peasants to sell their surplus grain to the state.

    The meeting believed that it was correct for the county's cadres to actively lead agricultural production, but it was incorrect to neglect the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. For example, Zhang Xingyi, the secretary of the First District Committee of the county, held a purely utilization view of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, without providing leadership and education, believing that it was the business of the county cooperative; he believed that the leadership of industry and commerce in Chengguan Town was the business of the Tax Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Section, and he never interfered. The meeting criticized these erroneous ideas and pointed out that the complete improvement of the lives of farmers depends on the realization of agricultural collectivization; rural cadres should not only lead agricultural labor mutual aid and cooperation well, but also frequently pay attention to leading credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicraft production cooperatives, and gradually make agriculture and private industry and commerce accept socialist transformation.

    The meeting also criticized the capitalist ideas existing within the Party and the laissez-faire errors in the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation. At present, the spontaneous forces in the countryside are developing, and the phenomenon of Party members storing grain and not selling it or buying grain is also very serious. Through criticism and self-criticism, the cadres attending the meeting raised their awareness. For example, Zhang Yuguo, the party branch secretary of Xiaotun Village, who was not actively leading mutual aid and cooperation in the past, said that he would hold a branch meeting when he returned to get the mutual aid and cooperation work going.

    The meeting also focused on criticizing the erroneous ideas that increasing production and practicing economy were "old tricks" and "there is nothing to save," and that they were indifferent to increasing production and practicing economy. The cadres attending the meeting realized that increasing production and practicing economy did not mean eating chaff and swallowing vegetables, but rather producing more grain, selling the grain to the state, exchanging it for means of production and means of livelihood, and expanding reproduction. After the party branch secretary of Yuanben Temple Village understood the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, he calculated carefully and found that the whole village could increase production and save 120,000 jin of grain by using methods such as inspecting seedlings and replanting in wheat fields, turning over bean stalks, using bran, ginning cotton, and cutting white grass. This concrete fact greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all the cadres to lead the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strengthened their confidence in increasing production and practicing economy. The meeting also initially determined the county's plan for increasing production and practicing economy.

    中共河南淇县县委召开全县干部大会
    根据国家总路线的精神检查和总结工作
    【本报讯】中共河南淇县县委在十月下旬召开了全县县、区、乡级干部扩大会议，根据总路线总任务的精神，检查和总结了今年的工作，并批判了工作中的错误和缺点，初步确定了全县增产节约计划。
    会议首先批判了干部中的片面的农民观点，树立了国家观念和工农联盟思想。会议认为：在领导农业生产中，由党内到党外普遍存在着把农民利益和国家利益对立起来的观点，尤其严重的是少数党员干部有自私自利的损害国家利益的行为。如王堆乡乡长王洪水，家中存麦几十石，但在夏征时却藉口受灾，不缴公粮。此外，他对国家给农民的贷款采取管贷不管收的态度。会议批判了这种错误思想，并明确指出：四年来由于经济的恢复和发展，工业品价格天天下降，人民都能买到廉价的生产资料与生活资料。这充分说明了国家在实行社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业及私营工商业实行社会主义改造的过渡时期中，正在逐步地在发展生产的基础上提高人民（占全国人口大多数的农民自然包括在内）的物质和文化生活水平。到会干部在明确认识到国家工业化是全党全体人民的最高利益以后，都表示回乡去后要开展互助合作运动，搞好生产，多打粮食，并教育农民，把余粮卖给国家。
    会议认为：全县干部积极领导农业生产是对的，但忽视了对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，却是不对的。例如该县第一区区委书记张兴义对基层供销合作社存在着单纯使用观点，而不进行领导和教育，认为那是县合作社的事；对城关镇工商业的领导，他认为是税务局、工商科的事，自己从不过问。会议批判了这些错误思想，并指出：农民生活的彻底改善，有待于农业集体化的实现；农村干部不但要领导好农业劳动互助合作，还要经常地注意领导信用合作社、供销合作社和手工业生产合作社，并使农业和私营工商业逐步接受社会主义改造。
    会议同时批判了党内存在的资本主义思想和对互助合作领导的放任自流错误。现在农村中的自发势力正在发展，党员里面存粮不卖或买进粮食的现象也很严重。经过批评和自我批评，到会干部提高了觉悟。例如过去不积极领导互助合作的萧屯村党支部书记张玉国，表示回去就开支部大会，把互助合作工作搞起来。
    会议还着重批判了认为增产节约是“老一套”、
  “没啥节约”，对增产节约漠不关心等等错误思想。到会干部认清了增产节约不是要吃糠咽菜，而是要多打粮食，把粮食卖给国家，换回生产资料和生活资料，扩大再生产。原本庙村支部书记认识了增产节约的意义后，通过算细账，算出全村如用麦田查苗补种、翻豆秸、谷糠、轧棉花、割白草等方法，可增产节约十二万斤粮食。这种具体事实大大鼓舞了全体干部领导增产节约运动的热情，坚定了增产节约信心。会议并初步确定了全县的增产节约计划。
