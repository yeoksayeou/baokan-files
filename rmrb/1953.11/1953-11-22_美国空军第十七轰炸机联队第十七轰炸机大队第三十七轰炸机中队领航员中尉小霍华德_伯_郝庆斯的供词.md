Confession of Lieutenant Howard Burton Houchins, Jr., Navigator of the 37th Bombardment Squadron, 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force

    My name is Howard Burton Houchins, Jr., service number AO—2077668, age twenty-eight. Before being captured, I was a navigator on a B-26 aircraft in the 37th Squadron of the 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing, stationed at K-9 base near Pusan, Korea. My rank is Lieutenant. My home address is 143 Dunhaven Drive, Garfield Park, New Castle, Delaware, USA. I am a U.S. Air Force Reserve officer who was recalled to active duty in January 1952. I left California around July 17, 1952, arrived in Japan around July 21, 1952, and arrived at K-9 base on July 29, 1952, with the 17th Bombardment Wing and 17th Bombardment Group (Colonel Wasson and Colonel Lindley were the commanders of these units, respectively).

    I first encountered the topic of germ warfare in a lecture that was part of my regular flight group training at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The date, as far as I can recall, was May 15, 1952. The lecture was given by a lieutenant in a classroom at the ground school. I remember that Lieutenant James Sidlo and Lieutenant Timothy also attended the lecture. Some of the personnel who attended that lecture were later assigned to the 17th Bombardment Group with me.

    The lieutenant began his lecture by saying, "Yes, there are germ bombs, and they are being used in Korea."

    He continued, "The germ bombs we will be dropping are about the size of a 500-pound regular bomb and usually have a timed fuse. The bacterial material inside is usually a powder. If this weapon can be correctly placed in a water source or placed in a location where it can flow into a water source, it is very deadly and effective."

    "Hygiene is not a serious problem on our own bases because the bacterial material has already been prepared and loaded into sealed germ bombs before it reaches any of our air bases."

    The lieutenant also stated that the method of dropping germ bombs is almost the same as dropping regular bombs.

    The lieutenant continued, "This is a highly classified matter. Today's lecture is an introductory one, given to you so that you will not be too surprised when flying this type of mission over there. This lecture is classified as confidential and is not allowed to be discussed." His lecture ended there.

    We arrived at our unit (our troops were stationed at K-9 base) on July 29, 1952. Afterwards, we first participated in the ground school there. The lecture on germ warfare in Korea was given around August 2, 1952, by a Captain Lamond, at the classroom in the group's ground school. In this class, Captain Lamond told us things that were generally the same as what we had heard at Langley Base. He said that the germ bombs we were to drop were about 500 pounds in size, but their weight was between 275 and 300 pounds. He said that the bacteria used were those that cause dysentery and bubonic plague. He also told us that the substance inside these germ bombs was usually a germ-contaminated powder, and the bomb head was equipped with a timed fuse, usually adjusted to explode about 500 feet above the ground. He told us that the pre-flight procedures were almost the same as with regular bombs. He also assured us that during our time here, we would fly several missions to drop these germ bombs, but these missions would generally be short and easy.

    We were told that if any accidents occurred while carrying germ bombs, then for safety's sake, we must drop these germ bombs at least ten miles offshore.

    Lamond reminded us again that it was most important not to talk about germ warfare outside the briefing room, and the punishment for leaking classified material was a military trial and imprisonment.

    I remember that there was hardly any laughter or joking as we left that lecture. We were beginning to realize the significance of germ warfare.

    Around September 12, 1952, we first saw our flight crew listed on the "Special Missions" list on the bulletin board. Our feelings were mixed. We were unwilling to participate in this inhumane form of warfare, but at the same time, we wanted to get a record of completing a mission. Personally, I hoped to go home and spend Christmas with my family. As a result, we disregarded our consciences and carried out the mission.

    My first germ bomb dropping mission was aimed at the town of Sipori, on September 12, 1952. When James Sidlo, Ray Van Noroy, and I dropped bombs on this town, I used a crossroads within the town as my aiming point. We dropped six germ bombs.

    At about 3:30 PM on September 18, 1952, Lieutenant James Sidlo, my pilot, and I attended a special briefing for a germ bomb dropping mission. All other flight crews in the group who were also listed on the "Special Missions" list for that night also attended the briefing. As far as I can recall, Captain Rudolph's flight crew and Captain Charles Murray's flight crew were also listed on the "Special Missions" list for that night.

    Captain Lamond gave us intelligence about navigation and bombing. Our target was Majon-ri, a small town west of Wonsan. We would only make one horizontal flight during the bombing, with all the aircraft lined up in a straight line, dropping bombs one after another, and then flying back to base. He further informed us that each aircraft would carry six germ bombs with timed fuses.

    Subsequently, the communications officer told us the order in which to report aircraft positions via radio and the frequencies to be used. Then, the ground liaison officer told us that there were no changes at the front.

    Then, the intelligence officer told us the current code words and the passwords for friendly agents, and told us to fly towards the coast in case of any accidents, because our navy could help us there.

    Following that, the weather officer gave us a twenty-four-hour weather forecast.

    Finally, the briefing officer reminded us to be careful about secrecy. He said that this was a highly classified mission, and no one was allowed to talk about it outside the briefing room.

    That night, the three of us, Lieutenant James Sidlo, the pilot, I, the navigator, and Private First Class Ray Van Noroy, the gunner, carried out this mission as instructed. We took off at 11:00 PM. In order to find the small town of Majon-ri, we flew towards a high mountain (about 5,500 feet high) west of Wonsan and south of Majon-ri. When we saw what we thought was that high mountain, we turned left and found a large river that flowed almost directly north and south. We flew north along the river to our target. We had been told to aim at what we thought was the center of the town. Majon-ri was located in a valley along the river. There was a large intersection in this town, so I aimed at this intersection, which I could barely distinguish, and dropped the germ bombs. My main feeling at the time was terror, and I could imagine what the residents of the town would be facing. All three of us watched carefully to see if we had hit the target, but we did not see any explosions.

    After landing at the base, we went to the group's intelligence office to report. As usual, there was an intelligence officer there. When we talked about the results of the bombing, we told him that we had not seen anything. The officer there explained that germ bombs with timed fuses that contained powder-type agents created very slight explosions in the air and dissipated so quickly that the flight crew could not see the entire process. So, we reported, "No results were visible," and that concluded the report and another mission for our flight crew.

    My third germ bomb dropping mission was on October 4, 1952, taking off from K-1 base near Pusan. The entire 17th Bombardment Group moved from K-9 base to K-1 base around September 30, 1952. The 17th Wing headquarters remained at K-9 base. The reason for the move was to allow the engineers to repair the runway at K-9 base. The group was expected to move back to K-9 base before December.

    My third germ bomb dropping mission was carried out with the same flight crew: Lieutenant Sidlo, Private First Class Van Noroy, and myself. We carried six germ bombs. Our target was Hwacheon-ri. I aimed at the road that passed through the town and dropped the six germ bombs.

    On October 7, 1952, Sidlo, Van Noroy, and I flew my fourth germ bomb dropping mission together. I aimed at a point along the river and dropped six germ bombs, which I believed was our target, Puan (transliteration).

    On October 9, 1952, James Sidlo, Ray Van Noroy, and I carried out my fifth germ bomb dropping mission together. Our target was an "anti-aircraft trap," namely, Hoeyang. When anti-aircraft fire was directed at us, I dropped all six germ bombs at once. I don't know how accurate I was; I was too scared to care. I think we flew over the target at about 11:30 PM.

    My sixth germ bomb dropping mission was on October 14, 1952, still carried out with the same flight crew. The target was Sagilli. The small town was located in a valley, and my aiming point was a curved part of the road and a bend in a small river there. We dropped six germ bombs there, and I think I dropped them fairly accurately this time.

    My seventh germ bomb dropping mission was on October 17, 1952. Sidlo, Van Noroy, and I again targeted Majon-ri. The bomb load was six germ bombs of the powder type. We still used the same method to find the target, namely, flying towards the high mountain and then going up the river to the valley. We were shot at when we dropped the germ bombs, so I can't comment on the accuracy of my bombing. Besides, we wouldn't have seen any explosions anyway.

    In my seven germ bomb dropping missions, we always received briefings in the same way, usually with Captain Lamond giving us the relevant information. During the briefings, we were told to carry germ bombs. The number of flight crews carrying out germ bomb dropping missions on one night varied from three to six. During the briefings, we were reminded of the emergency measures to be taken in the event of an accident and that we should not discuss this mission in any way outside the briefing room. I think almost everyone in the squadron had carried out this type of mission. Everyone who came to this unit with me had carried out germ bomb dropping missions by the end of October.

    The group carried out germ bomb dropping missions at most three or four nights a week, and at least one night a week. But there was a lot of variation, depending entirely on what the Fifth Air Force felt like.

    I flew a total of seven germ bomb dropping missions in Korea. The main feeling people had about germ warfare seemed to be a sense of shame and fear. No one involved in this was proud of what they were doing. But as far as I can remember, no one ever refused to fly this type of mission. The missions were too easy and too short. Everyone was in such a hurry to go home that they wouldn't refuse to carry out this type of mission. In short, each mission brought you closer to your family.

    On October 29, 1952, on my thirty-fifth flight mission, my plane was hit near the plateau, and I was the only one who parachuted out.

    After being captured, I had some time to reflect, and I realized even more than before just how terrible germ warfare really is. Any civilized person should be disgusted by it. I have been treated well by the Chinese People's Volunteers, so well that I realize they must be seeking peace. Now, all I ask is to return to a family in a peaceful world, to raise my family without fear—fear that we will be destroyed by some inhumane weapons. Yes, I want peace, and I am willing to work for peace.

    美国空军第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七轰炸机中队领航员中尉小霍华德·伯·郝庆斯的供词
    我的名字是小霍华德·伯顿·郝庆斯，军号A O—2077668，二十八岁，被俘前，是朝鲜釜山附近K —9基地的第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七中队的B — 26型飞机上的领航员。我的军阶是中尉。我的家住在美国特拉华州纽卡塞尔市葛菲尔德公园顿海文大道一四三号。我是美国空军后备军官，于一九五二年一月被重召服现役。我约于一九五二年七月十七日离开加利福尼亚州，一九五二年七月二十一日左右到达日本，一九五二年七月二十九日到达K —9基地第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队（瓦逊上校及林德莱上校分别为各该单位的司令官）。
    在我所上过的一堂讲课中，我第一次接触到细菌战，该课是我在弗吉尼亚州兰莱基地所受的正规飞行组训练的一部分。日期据我记忆所及是一九五二年五月十五日。讲课是在地面学校的一间教室里进行的，由一个中尉讲授。我记得詹姆斯·西德洛中尉和蒂莫西中尉也曾出席听课，有些听了那次讲课的人员后来与我一起被指派到第十七轰炸机大队去了。
    该中尉开始他的讲课道：“是的，细菌弹实在是有的，并且正在朝鲜被使用。”
    接着他说：“我们将投掷的那种细菌弹和五百磅普通炸弹大小差不多，通常有一个定时信管。弹内细菌物质通常是一种粉末。假如能正确地把这种武器放在水源的地方或把它放在某一个能使它流入水源的地方，它是非常致命而有效的。”
    “在我们自己的基地上，卫生问题并不是一个严重的问题，因为细菌物质在到达我们任何一个空军基地之前就已经配制好了，并已装入封起来的细菌弹里面了。”
    该中尉并声称，投掷细菌弹的方法几乎和普通炸弹一样。
    该中尉继续说道：“这是高度秘密性的事情。今天所讲的是一次介绍性的讲课，讲给你们听是为了使你们在那边飞行这种任务时，不致于太惊奇。这次讲课是列于机密一类，不允许谈论它。”他的讲课就这样结束了。
    我们于一九五二年七月二十九日抵达我们单位
  （我们的部队驻在K —9基地）。此后，我们首先参加了那里的地面学校，在朝鲜的细菌战讲课，约于一九五二年八月二日由一位拉蒙德上尉讲授，地点在大队地面学校的教室中。在这堂课中，拉蒙德上尉所告诉我们的东西，大体上和我们在兰莱基地所听到的一样。他说，我们要投掷的是五百磅大小的那种细菌弹，但其重量是在二百七十五磅到三百磅之间。他说，所使用的细菌是引起痢疾和腺鼠疫的细菌。他并告诉我们说，这种细菌弹内所装的物质通常是染菌粉末，弹头装有定时信管，通常把它调整到在离地约五百英尺时爆炸。他告诉我们说，飞行前的各种程序几乎和普通炸弹一样。他并且肯定地对我们说，当我们在这里值勤的期间，我们将飞行若干次这种投掷细菌弹的任务，但这种任务一般都为期很短而且很容易。
    我们被告知，在携带细菌弹时，若发生任何意外，那么，为了安全起见，我们必须将这些细菌弹扔到离海岸至少十英里的海上。
    拉蒙德重又提醒我们说，最重要的是不能在简令室以外谈论关于细菌战这件事，对于泄漏秘密材料的惩罚是军事审判与监禁。
    我记得在我们离开那次讲课的时候，几乎没有什么笑声和开玩笑的情形。我们开始意识到细菌战的意义了。
    约在一九五二年九月十二日，我们第一次看到我们的飞行组被列在布告板上的“特殊任务”名单中。我们的心情是复杂的。我们不愿意参加这种不人道的战争方式，但同时我们又想得到执行一次任务的记录。拿我个人来说，我就希望能回家与家人在一起过圣诞节。结果，我们不顾自己的良心而执行了任务。
    我第一次投掷细菌弹任务的目标是洗浦里镇，这是在一九五二年九月十二日。当我和詹姆斯·西德洛、雷·范诺艾向此镇投弹时，我以该镇内一交叉路口作为瞄准点。我们投了六枚细菌弹。
    一九五二年九月十八日下午三时三十分左右，我和我的驾驶员詹姆斯·西德洛中尉参加了一次投掷细菌弹任务的特殊简令，大队里全部其他被列入那晚执行“特殊任务”名单中的飞行组也一同参加了那次简令。据我记忆所及，鲁道夫上尉的飞行组及查尔斯·墨莱上尉的飞行组也被列入在该晚执行“特殊任务”的名单中。
    拉蒙德上尉授予我们关于领航及投弹方面的情报，我们的目标是马转里，这是在元山以西的一个小镇。我们将仅作一次投弹时的水平飞行，所有的飞机排成一直线，先后投弹，然后飞返基地。他更通知我们说：每架飞机要携带六枚有定时信管的细菌弹。
    随后，通讯官告诉我们用无线电报告飞机位置的先后次序及所用之各周率。随后，地面联络官告诉我们前线并无变化。
    随后，情报官告诉我们现行密码暗语及友方特务的暗号，并告诉我们在发生任何意外时飞向海岸，因为在那里我们的海军能帮助我们。
    跟着是气象官给我们一个二十四小时的气象预报。
    最后，简令官提醒我们要注意保密。他说，这是高度机密性的任务，出了简令室就不许谈论这件事。
      当晚，我们三人，驾驶员詹姆斯·西德洛中尉，领航员我及射击手一等兵雷·范诺艾，像规定的那样执行了这次任务。我们在下午十一时起飞。为了寻找马转里小镇，我们飞向元山以西、马转里以南的一座高山（约五千五百英尺高）。当我们看到了我们认为是那座高山时，我们便向左转，发现了一条大河，这条河几乎作正南北方向流动，我们沿河向北一直飞到了我们的目标。我们曾被告知要向我们认为是城镇的中心瞄准。马转里位在沿河的一个山谷里。这个镇里有个大交叉路口，所以，我就对这个我只能勉强分别得出来的交叉路口瞄准，并抛出了细菌弹。当时我心里主要的感觉是恐怖，我能想像到该镇的居民将面临些什么。我们三人都注意地看是否命中了目标，可是，我们并没有看见任何爆炸。
      我们在基地降落后，就去大队情报室汇报。像通常一样，有一位情报官在那里。当我们谈及投弹结果时，我们告诉他说什么都没有看到。在那里的那位军官便说明，备有定时信管的内装粉末类型的细菌弹，在空中的爆炸是非常轻微的，并且消散得如此之快，以致于飞行组不可能看到这整个过程。所以，我们汇报说：“看不见任何结果”，就这样结束了汇报及我们飞行组的又一次任务。
    我第三次投掷细菌弹的任务是在一九五二年十月四日，从釜山附近的K -1基地起飞。第十七轰炸机大队约于一九五二年九月三十日全部由K -9基地搬到K-1基地。第十七联队总部仍留于K -9基地。迁移的理由是为了让工兵重新补修K -9基地的跑道。大队预计在十二月前搬回K -9基地。
    我第三次投掷细菌弹的任务是和同一飞行组进行的，即：西德洛中尉、范诺艾一等兵和我自己。我们携带了六枚细菌弹。我们的目标是化川里。我对着经过该城的大路瞄准，并投下了这六枚细菌弹。
    在一九五二年十月七日，西德洛、范诺艾和我一起执行了我的第四次投掷细菌弹的任务。我向着沿河的某地点瞄准，并投下了六枚细菌弹，我认为那里就是我们的目标浦安（译音）。
      在一九五二年十月九日，詹姆斯·西德洛、雷·范诺艾又和我一同执行我的第五次投掷细菌弹的任务。我们的目标是一个“高射炮陷阱”，即：淮阳。当高射炮火向我们射来时，我就将六枚细菌弹一并扔出，我不知道我的准确性如何，我害怕得顾不了这个。我想我们约在下午十一时三十分左右飞临目标上空。
    我的第六次投掷细菌弹的任务是在一九五二年十月十四日，仍是和相同的飞行组人员一起执行的。目标是士基里。该小镇位于一山谷中，我的瞄准点为大路的一个弯曲部分及那里一条小河的转弯之处。我们在那里投下六枚细菌弹，我认为我这次投得相当准确。
    我的第七次投掷细菌弹的任务在一九五二年十月十七日，西德洛、范诺艾和我又以马转里为目标。装弹量是六枚内装粉末类型的细菌弹。我们仍用同样的办法来找到目标，即：飞向高山，再沿河而上到山谷。当我们投掷细菌弹的时候，我们遭到射击，因此，我不能评论关于我投弹的准确性。况且无论如何我们也不会看到任何爆炸的。
    在我的七次投掷细菌弹的任务中，我们一直以同样的方式接到简令，通常由拉蒙德上尉来授予有关情报。在简令时，我们被告知要携带细菌弹。在一天晚上执行投掷细菌弹任务的飞行组数目，少则三组，多则六组不等。在简令时，我们被提醒在发生意外时所应采取的紧急措施。及我们不得在简令室外以任何方式谈论这种任务。我想，在中队中几乎每个人都曾执行过这种任务。所有与我一起来到该部队的人员，到十月底的时候，都曾执行过这种投掷细菌弹的任务。
    大队在一星期的期间内，至多有三、四个晚上执行这种投掷细菌弹的任务，至少也有一个晚上。但变动很大，完全看第五航空队的感觉如何而定。
    我在朝鲜一共飞了七次投掷细菌弹的任务。人们对于细菌战的主要的心情，似乎是一种羞耻和恐惧的感觉。没有一个参与此事的人对其所作的工作感到自傲。但据我记忆所及，也没有一个人曾经拒绝飞行这种任务。这种任务太容易了，为时也甚短。每个人都这样急于回家，以致于不会拒绝执行这种任务。总之，每次任务都使你和你的家人更接近一些。
      一九五二年十月二十九日，那是我的第三十五次飞行任务，我的飞机在高原附近被击中了，只有我一个人跳伞而出。
      我被俘后，有了一些时间来回顾一下，我比以前更能认识到细菌战的确是如何可怕。任何一个文明人都应该对它感到厌恶。我受到中国志愿军的良好待遇，这种待遇是如此的好，使我认识到他们一定是要求和平的。现在，我所要求的一切便是回到一个在和平世界里的家庭中去，在没有恐惧--恐惧我们会被某些不人道的武器所毁灭--之中扶养我的家庭。是的，我要和平，我并愿为和平而工作。小霍华德·伯·郝庆斯（签名）美国空军中尉军号A O-2077668一九五三年一月十六日北朝鲜（新华社）（附图片）
