    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant
    Successfully Completes This Year's Construction Plan
    The newly built Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant victoriously completed this year's construction plan in early November. This year, the total construction area reached over 40,000 square meters, and 208 machines were installed. The major projects under construction this year were completed ahead of schedule across the board. For example, the heating installation project was completed one month ahead of the original plan. The tool factory and repair shop can start trial production in late November, two months ahead of schedule. The main structure of the largest cutter factory was originally planned to only have the steel frame erected and part of the roofing completed this year, but now the external works are basically finished, and the installation of machinery has begun. Due to the successful completion of this year's construction plan, ten projects, including the measuring tool factory building and office building, which were originally planned for construction next year, can be started this winter. Therefore, the entire factory is estimated to be completed and put into production half a year ahead of schedule.
    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is China's first modern tool manufacturing plant. Its production volume after completion will be dozens of times greater than that of China's existing tool factories. The early completion of this year's construction plan is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great ally, the Soviet Union. In 1951, the Soviet Union helped us design this factory. The accuracy and completeness of the design drawings ensured the smooth progress of the project. In May of this year, Soviet experts came to the factory in person to help us with construction. By September, they had put forward 1,266 valuable suggestions, which not only ensured the quality of the project but also greatly accelerated the progress of the project. For example, Soviet experts helped the concrete processing plant establish a steam curing room, adopted the Soviet method of rapid demolding of prefabricated reinforced concrete components, and used mechanical manufacturing methods such as hoists, mixers, vibrating tables, and rollers, which increased the processing efficiency of prefabricated concrete components by 22 times. Soviet experts went deep into the site every day to check and provide specific guidance. Their selfless and dedicated work spirit and scientific and pragmatic style greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all employees. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂
    胜利完成今年建厂计划
    新建哈尔滨量具刃具厂已在十一月上旬胜利完成了今年度的建厂计划。今年共已建筑面积四万多平方公尺，安装机器二百零八台。今年施工的各项主要工程普遍提前完成了任务。如暖汽安装工程比原计划提前一个月竣工。工具厂、修配厂可以提前两个月，在十一月下旬开始试车生产。最大的刃具厂厂房原计划今年只上好钢房架和做好一部分屋面，而现在外部工程已基本结束，并开始了机器安装。由于今年建厂计划完成得好，这个厂原来计划明年施工的量具厂房、办公大楼等十项工程已可提前在今年冬季开工。因而整个工厂估计可以比原计划提前半年建成，并投入生产。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂是我国第一个现代化的工具制造厂，它建成后的生产量将数十倍地大于我国现有工具厂的生产量。这个厂今年建设计划的提前完成，是和伟大盟邦苏联的无私帮助分不开的。一九五一年苏联就帮助我们设计了这个工厂，设计图纸的准确和完整，保证了工程的顺利进行。今年五月间苏联专家们又亲自来厂帮助我们施工。他们到九月份共提出一千二百六十六件宝贵建议，不仅保证了工程质量，并大大加快了工程的进度。如苏联专家帮助混凝土加工厂建立了蒸汽养生室，采取苏联钢筋混凝土预制件快速脱模作业法，并利用卷扬机、搅拌机、震动台、滚动器等机械制造法，使混凝土预制件加工效率提高了二十二倍。苏联专家们天天深入现场检查和具体指导。他们身体力行的忘我工作精神和科学的求实作风，大大鼓舞了全体职工的积极性。　（新华社）
