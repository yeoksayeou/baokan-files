    All-China Students' Federation
    Notice Regarding the 18th Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
    1. The 18th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement is approaching. This movement initiated a surge in the national anti-Japanese and national salvation movement, demonstrated the lofty patriotic spirit of the Chinese people and youth, and pointed out the correct path for Chinese intellectuals to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. After more than ten years of arduous struggle, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, we have completed the task of the New Democratic Revolution. Now our motherland has entered a new period of gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. Therefore, student federations and student associations at all levels should use the commemoration of this festival to vigorously cooperate with the publicity of the Party's general line and focus on educating young people about revolutionary traditions.
    2. The revolutionary tradition of the "December 9th" Movement lies in its promotion of a selfless patriotic spirit under the leadership of the Party, and in implementing the correct path of integrating intellectuals with the worker-peasant masses. Educating young people to inherit and carry forward this tradition requires them to always maintain the spirit of fearing no difficulties and striving hard in their respective posts of national construction today, actively and creatively engaging in labor, and becoming outstanding builders of socialism.
    3. Student federations and student associations in various cities may, around December 9th, use holidays and spare time to conduct small-scale commemorative activities jointly or independently. The methods of activity can be adapted to local conditions, using forms such as seminars, lectures, gatherings, and evening parties. The content is not limited to the promotion of the "December 9th" Movement; people can be invited to report on the country's general line, general tasks, and construction in various fields, report on the prospects for the development of the city or locality, or invite comrades who participated in the "December 9th" Movement to tell stories of the youth movement, invite teachers to participate in gatherings, chat about learning, and link it to the current general tasks to inspire young people to love knowledge, love labor, and love the socialist future.
