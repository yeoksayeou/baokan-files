National higher education institutions across the country have successively welcomed new students. In welcoming the new students, the administrative leadership of many schools established a "New Student Reception Working Committee." The Communist Youth League organizations also selected cadres to assist the schools in welcoming the new students. The student unions printed "New Student Guides." The administrative offices and related departments of many schools worked together to ensure that every new student completed the admission procedures quickly upon arrival. Older students organized various groups, such as service and cultural entertainment groups, to make the new students feel happy, comfortable, and the warmth of a revolutionary family in their lives.

After the new students settled down, the schools conducted professional ideological education for them, so that the new students would obey the needs of the country and study according to the assigned major. The administrative leadership of schools such as the Beijing Mining Institute, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Nankai University, Beijing Normal University, Sun Yat-sen University, Dalian Institute of Technology, Northwest University, Fujian Agricultural College, and Sichuan Chemical Industry College introduced the situation of their respective schools to the new students, explained the nature and tasks of the school and its position and role in national construction, and hoped that each student could establish their own interests and aspirations according to the needs of the country. For example, in order to help new students further understand the coal mining industry, the Beijing Mining Institute organized a report meeting with rich content, introducing the development of the motherland's coal mining industry and the school's development prospects to everyone. The institute also organized a symposium, first letting the older students express their feelings. One student said to the new students: "Ships and trains need coal, huge thermal power generators also need coal, and steel mills cannot do without coal. If we have no coal, the people's lives will be unimaginable." This made the new students like their major. Tsinghua University focused on introducing majors such as pressure processing, foundry, and highway engineering to the new students, and invited responsible comrades from the enterprise sector to make reports. Peking University focused on introducing majors such as meteorology. Dalian Institute of Technology organized new students to visit the school's practice factory and Dalian's industrial museum and seaport; Beijing Agricultural University organized new students to visit the school's experimental farm and laboratory; and Beijing Geological College, Beijing Medical College, and Central China Higher Normal School organized exhibitions. Some schools, according to their own special circumstances, showed Soviet films such as "Donbass Miners," "Michurin," "For Life," and "Rural Doctor." Through the above activities, the new students' professional ideology and learning confidence were strengthened. Some schools, while conducting professional ideological education, also conducted education on learning discipline among the new students, so that the new students consciously abide by the school's various systems and disciplines.

Currently, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Northeast Institute of Geology and other schools have announced the list of students in each major. The students have happily embarked on the learning positions assigned by the motherland, and are welcoming new learning tasks with a fighting posture.

    全国高等学校向新生进行专业思想教育
    全国各地高等学校新生已陆续报到入学。在迎接新生中，许多学校的行政领导方面成立了“迎接新生工作委员会”，青年团组织并选派干部，协助学校方面做好迎接新生的工作，学生会印发了“新同学须知”。许多学校的教务处及有关的部门联合办公，使每一个新同学在到校后迅速办完入学手续。老同学组织了各种小组，如服务、文化娱乐等组，使新同学在生活上感到愉快舒适和革命大家庭的温暖。
    新同学的生活安定下来以后，各校都对新同学进行了专业思想教育，使新同学服从国家需要，按照所分配的专业进行学习。北京矿业学院、清华大学、北京大学、南开大学、北京师范大学、中山大学、大连工学院、西北大学、福建农学院、四川化学工业学院等校的行政领导方面，都向新同学介绍了本校的情况，说明了学校的性质、任务及其在国家建设中的地位和作用，希望每个同学都能根据国家的需要来确立自己的兴趣和志愿。例如北京矿业学院为了帮助新同学更进一步地了解煤矿事业，组织了一个有丰富内容的报告会，向大家介绍了祖国煤矿事业发展的情况和学校发展的远景。该院又组织了座谈会，先让老同学发表自己的感想。有一个同学对新同学说：“轮船、火车都需要煤，巨大的火力发电机也需要煤，炼钢厂更是离不了煤。如果我们没有煤，人民的生活将是不可想像的。”这样就使新同学对自己的专业产生了爱好。清华大学着重向新同学介绍了压力加工、铸工、公路等专业，并请企业部门的负责同志作了报告。北京大学着重介绍了气象等专业。大连工学院组织新同学参观了学校的实习工厂和大连市的工业博物馆、海港等；北京农业大学组织新同学参观了学校的实验农场、实验室等；北京地质学院、北京医学院和华中高等师范学校等校都组织了展览会。有些学校根据本校的特殊情况，分别放映了“顿巴斯矿工”、“米丘林”、“为了生命”、“乡村医生”等苏联影片。通过上述种种活动，加强了新同学的专业思想和学习信心。还有一些学校在进行专业思想教育的同时，在新生中进行了有关学习纪律的教育，使新生自觉遵守学校的各种制度和纪律。
    现在，北京大学、清华大学、东北地质学院等学校，已公布了各专业同学的名单。同学们都愉快地走上了祖国所分配的学习岗位，以战斗的姿态迎接新的学习任务。
