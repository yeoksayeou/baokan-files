    Seeing Off
    Cai Qingsheng
    "Amani, we are leaving tonight." Amani, with tears in her eyes, stuffed the steaming corn into my arms. She carried my backpack on her head, saw me off for one li, and then another li. "Go back! Amani." I urged her once, and then again. Emotion choked my throat, and my voice grew softer with each plea. In the dim moonlight, I watched Amani waving to me, her white hair fluttering in the night wind. "She's just like my own mother!" My eyes filled with tears! Carrying the love of a Korean mother for me, I transferred to a new front.

    送　行
    蔡庆生
    “阿妈妮，我们今天晚上要离开这里。”阿妈妮含着眼泪，把热气腾腾的苞米，塞进我的怀里。头顶着我的背包，送了一里，再送一里。“回去吧！阿妈妮。”催了一次，又催一次。激动使得喉咙发哽，我的声音一次比一次低。在朦胧的月光下，我望着向我招手的阿妈妮，她的白发在夜风中飘起。“真像我的亲妈呀！”我的眼里充满了热泪！怀着朝鲜母亲对我的热爱，转移到新的阵地。
