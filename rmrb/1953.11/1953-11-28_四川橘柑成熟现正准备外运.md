    Sichuan Oranges and Tangerines Mature and are Being Prepared for Shipment
    The oranges and tangerines of Sichuan are ripe. On the continuous hillsides where the fruit trees grow densely, everywhere are the golden-shining sweet oranges (commonly known as Guanggan), the red tangerines, and the round pomelos. The streets of Chongqing are piled high with various kinds of oranges and tangerines from famous production areas.
    State-owned trading companies and cooperatives have sent a large number of personnel deep into the producing areas to purchase, and are actively preparing to promote sales at home and abroad. Soon, not only the people of Beijing and Shanghai, but even Soviet friends in faraway Moscow will be able to eat Sichuan oranges and tangerines. Being able to successfully sell the fruits harvested from a year's labor is a great encouragement to the fruit farmers of Sichuan. Before liberation, Sichuan fruit farmers suffered from the cruel exploitation of the reactionary rule, and had no heart to manage their orchards, allowing the fruit trees to be infested with insects and rot. Many fruit farmers cut down their trees and burned them for firewood. By 1949, the production of oranges and tangerines in Sichuan had reached an extremely declining state. After liberation, the People's Government actively led fruit farmers in preventing and controlling pests and diseases, taught cultivation techniques, provided loan support, and organized sales to other places, greatly enhancing the fruit farmers' enthusiasm for production. Last year, the province produced about 200 million sweet oranges and red tangerines, reaching the highest record in history. This year, some local fruit trees are in their "small year" (a cultivation practice that farmers cannot avoid, "small year" means less fruit), and individual areas have been affected by pests and droughts, so the total output is slightly less than last year. However, even more new fruit trees are being planted this year, and the improved varieties of fruit seedlings cultivated in several horticultural farms in Sichuan are in great demand.
                                                                                        (Lin Mo)

    四川橘柑成熟现正准备外运
    四川的橘柑成熟了。在那些密密丛丛生长着果树的绵延不断的山坡上，到处是金光耀眼的甜橙
  （通称广柑）、红红的橘子和圆滚滚的大柚子。重庆街头堆满了来自各著名产区的各色各样的橘柑。
    国营贸易公司和合作社已派大批人员深入产地采购，积极准备向国内外推销；不久，不仅北京、上海的人们，连远在莫斯科的苏联朋友也可以吃到四川的橘柑了。能把一年劳动所收获到的果品顺利推销出去，这对四川的果农是一种莫大的鼓舞。解放以前，四川果农因遭受反动统治残酷剥削，无心经营，任凭果树生虫腐坏，许多果农把树砍了当柴烧。一九四九年四川橘柑生产已到了极为衰退的地步。解放以后，人民政府积极领导果农防治病虫害，传授栽培技术，进行贷款扶植，组织向外推销，果农生产情绪大为提高。去年全省甜橙、红橘出产约二亿个，已达到历史上的最高纪录。今年有些地方果树轮到小年（果农旧有栽培习惯所造成，小年要少结果），个别地方受虫、旱灾影响，总产量较去年略有减少。但今年栽培新果树的却更多了，四川几个园艺场所培植出的良种果苗都供不应求。　　　　　　　　　（林　沫）
