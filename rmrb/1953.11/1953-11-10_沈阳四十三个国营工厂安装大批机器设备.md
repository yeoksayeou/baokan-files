Shenyang Municipality is adding new machinery and equipment to forty-three state-owned factories in machinery, electrical engineering, rubber, textiles, medicine, and other industries during the first year of the Five-Year Plan. The largest installation projects are in the machinery industry. The First Machine Tool Factory, Pneumatic Tool Factory, Heavy Machinery Factory, and Mining Machinery Factory are installing several hundred machines of various types this year. These include gantry planers as long as twenty meters, as well as complex and precise optical grinders and coordinate boring machines. The two-thousand-ton hydraulic press installed at the Heavy Machinery Factory was transported by eighteen railroad cars. A single foundation bolt weighs over nine hundred catties (approximately 450 kg), and the frequently moving parts of the machine weigh over forty tons.

During the installation of these machines, workers, with their selfless labor, overcame many difficulties with the help of Soviet experts and the close cooperation of technicians and workers. For example, when the Heavy Machinery Factory was installing a component called the "big hat" on the two-thousand-ton hydraulic press, this component weighed thirty-five tons, but the plant only had a crane that could lift twenty-five tons. The moving workers created new lifting methods and finally lifted it onto the machine body, which was more than eight meters high. In terms of design, the original design of the hydraulic press placed the worker's operating position too close to the "town seat," and the heated workpiece could burn the worker. The technicians personally experienced the radiant heat on the forging hammer and accepted the workers' suggestions, not only improving the design but also adding a heat shield to improve the working conditions for the workers in the future.

The expansion of production equipment in these factories will further increase production capacity and add new product types. For example, the First Machine Tool Factory will be able to produce a large number of working machine tools—1A62 lathes—to supply to all parts of the country. After adding new production equipment, the Heavy Machinery Factory will be able to mass-produce large crushers, forge large steel parts, and produce heavy machinery and equipment such as large gears with diameters of five to eight meters, which could not be manufactured in our country in the past, to meet the needs of mines and factories across the country.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of machine installation projects, various factories have actively strengthened project management, promoted advanced experience, and workers have fully developed their labor creativity on the basis of ensuring quality. For example, when the Pneumatic Tool Factory installed the second batch of machines, worker Xia Changsi created a scribing method using a "T-square." This increased the record from scribing one machine in four hours to scribing seven machines in three hours, thereby completing the installation plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. In the second phase of the Mining Machinery Factory installation project, the Shenyang Installation Engineering Company formulated work plans, promoted instruction charts, and used advanced experiences such as one-time grouting methods, completing the machine foundation construction plan, which originally took one month, in only twenty days.

    沈阳四十三个国营工厂安装大批机器设备
    沈阳市在五年计划的第一年度里，有四十三个国营机械、电工、橡胶、纺织、医药等工厂正在增添新的机器设备。安装工程最大的是机械工业。第一机床厂、风动工具厂、重型机器厂、矿山机器厂在今年安装的各种机器，就有好几百台。其中有长达二十公尺的龙门刨床，有构造复杂和精密的光学磨床和坐标躺床。重型机器厂安装的两千吨水压机是由十八辆火车皮运来的，光一个地脚螺丝就有九百多斤重，机器上经常活动的部件就重四十多吨。
    这些机器在安装过程中，由于工人的忘我劳动，在苏联专家帮助下，在技术人员和工人紧密结合下，克服了不少的困难。例如重型机器厂在安装两千吨水压机上面的一个叫“大帽子”的部件时，这个部件重三十五吨，场房只有二十五吨的吊车，搬运工人由于创造新的吊装方法，终于把它抬到八公尺多高的机体上。在设计方面，原来设计的水压机工人操作位置和“镇子座”太近，烧热的工作物能烤伤工人，技术员们亲自到锻锤上体验辐射的热力，并接受了工人的意见，不但改进了设计，还增加了防热罩，改善了将来工人操作时的劳动条件。
    这些工厂由于生产设备的扩大，将进一步提高生产能力，增加新的产品种类。例如机床一厂今后可生产出大量的工作母机——一A六二车床供应全国各地。重型机器厂增添新的生产设备后，将可大量生产过去我国不能制造的大型破碎机，锻裁大的钢件，生产直径五公尺到八公尺的大牙轮等重型机器和器材，供给全国矿山、工厂的需要。
    各工厂为保证机器安装工程顺利完成，在施工中都积极加强工程的管理工作，推广先进经验，工人们更是在保证质量的基础上充分地发展了劳动创造性。例如风动工具厂在安装第二批机器时，工人夏长思创造了使用“丁字尺”的划线方法。由过去四小时划一台机器，提高到三小时划七台的纪录，因而使安装计划提前了十五天完成任务。沈阳安装工程公司在进行矿山机器厂第二期安装工程中，由于制订作业计划，推行指示图表和使用一次灌浆法等先进经验，使原来一个月完成的机器基础工程施工计划，只用了二十天的时间就完成了。
