    "It's Wrong to Insist That Public Ownership of Livestock is Deviation"
    By Our Reporter Lin Wei

    On May 23rd of this year, the "Shanxi Peasant" newspaper published a letter from Liang San, a planning committee member of the Baijiagou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qin County. The letter stated: The Cui Baohai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baijiagou consists of sixteen households, twelve of which originally collectively owned four head of livestock, now valued at 4.55 million yuan, which have been contributed to the cooperative. Based on the total labor and land burden of the cooperative, each household should contribute an average of over 280,000 yuan. The twelve households that originally owned livestock each contributed an average of over 370,000 yuan to the cooperative. The four households that did not originally own livestock have to pay over 90,000 yuan per year, totaling 1.12 million yuan over three years, to repay the livestock price. Recently, these four households expressed their desire to repay the debt in two years. However, just at this time, newspapers criticized the practice of valuing livestock and farm tools as contributions to the cooperative as a hasty and rash mistake, and suggested that they should be rented or hired instead. When the cooperative held a member meeting to discuss this issue, everyone calculated that the cooperative's 240 mu of land required 720 animal labor days per year. Calculating each animal labor day at a wage of eight sheng of rice, the annual cost would be 57 shi and 6 dou (equivalent to 6.912 million yuan, which is 2.362 million yuan more expensive than the purchase price). Therefore, everyone was unwilling to change to hiring. The cooperative then wrote to the "Shanxi Peasant" newspaper, asking whether, under these circumstances, they could contribute the livestock at a valuation and use them collectively.
    The "Shanxi Peasant" newspaper's editor's note and formal response criticized this letter. The main points were: First, from the perspective of the cooperative's interests, in addition to the purchase price, there are also daily feeding costs and management issues. Second, from the perspective of the livestock owners, it is more beneficial to hire out the livestock to the cooperative or individual farmers. Contributing the livestock at a valuation harms the interests of the livestock owners. Ordinary farmers will naturally feel reluctant to turn privately owned money and grain into public property. Public property must be accumulated slowly from increased farmer income. Third, from the perspective of the cooperative members who did not originally own livestock, becoming indebted upon joining the cooperative would affect their production enthusiasm. Although they would receive less grain due to the cooperative paying to hire livestock after the change to private ownership of livestock, they would not be in debt for three years and would maintain their current interests. The conclusion was: "The practice of contributing livestock at a valuation must be corrected."
    Generally speaking, these arguments are correct. However, in the specific location of Qin County, the results of practice necessitate a re-examination of this issue.
    At that time, Qin County had 52 agricultural production cooperatives. After inspection, five were shut down, leaving 47. The livestock of the cooperative members had all been valued and contributed to the cooperative for collective use. The provincial and regional inspectors all believed that it was necessary to resolutely and uniformly change them back to private ownership, to be hired or rented by the cooperative. However, the correction process was met with opposition from the cooperative members. After a long period of correction, only five cooperatives changed to private ownership, while the remaining 42 cooperatives continued to insist on collective ownership and use. Later, because it was impossible to correct them, the matter was dropped.
    The result of public ownership of livestock did not affect the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. The members (including those who originally owned livestock and those who did not) generally had high production enthusiasm, so the crops in the cooperatives were generally much better than those of individual farmers. After suffering from wind and drought disasters in the autumn, production still increased by 10% to 30% or more (based on last year's bumper harvest).
    Now the cooperative members are discussing winter production and the issue of livestock for next year. In the cooperatives where livestock is collectively owned, everyone still prefers collective ownership, and no one wants to change to private ownership. In the cooperatives where livestock is privately owned, two cooperatives have already formally expressed their opinions, requesting to change to collective ownership. The other three cooperatives have not yet expressed their opinions, but it is said that they are afraid that their opinions will not be heeded, or that if they become collectively owned now, the higher authorities will come to correct them in the future.
    Why can public ownership of livestock be successfully implemented in Qin County, while it is not feasible in many agricultural production cooperatives in other regions, and even leads to the risk of collapse? I recently learned that there are some special circumstances here: First, the farmers in Qin County have a long-standing habit of collectively raising livestock. Most farmers have three, four, or even five households collectively owning one head of livestock. Even slightly better households have two households collectively owning one head. It is extremely rare for a single household to own one or two heads of livestock. According to statistics from five villages including Xianzhuang, out of a total of 208 households raising livestock, only ten households owned one head independently, less than 5%; the remaining farmers collectively owned livestock. Second, the purpose of raising livestock is generally only to cultivate their own land, and it is only sufficient to cultivate their own land. Very few people use livestock for sideline production, and there are not many who sell cattle labor. Third, the total number of livestock is small, but there are many households with livestock, and it is very common. In general villages, households with livestock account for three-quarters or even four-fifths of the total number of households. According to statistics from the above five villages, the proportion of households with livestock in the total number of households is 74% to 96%. In the agricultural production cooperatives of these five villages, the proportion of households with livestock is 81% to 100%. Fourth, the vast majority of livestock are cattle and donkeys, each worth only tens of thousands to over one million yuan. Mules and horses are extremely rare. The cost of feeding cattle and donkeys (fodder costs) is also relatively low, and even with good grass and feed, it is only over one million yuan per year.
    These special circumstances make farmers feel that: private ownership of livestock is not very beneficial, it only allows them to cultivate their own land; public ownership of livestock is not harmful – it also allows them to cultivate their own small plots of land, and there are even more benefits. According to a slightly better farmer's calculation, owning half a head of livestock and selling half a month of cattle labor a year, plus pulling coal five or six times in the winter, only brings in three or four shi of grain (14.5 jin per dou). However, if they hand it over to the cooperative, each household can earn an average of this amount based on workdays. Individuals are also much more relaxed. If livestock is privately owned and fed, and hired out to the cooperative, half a head of livestock requires 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in fodder, requires feeding the livestock at night, and also requires sharing the cost of hiring livestock. According to the Baijiagou Cui Baohai cooperative's calculation, the total cost of hiring four head of livestock for one year is 6.912 million yuan. Divided among the sixteen households, each household has to share an average of over 430,000 yuan. Added to the aforementioned fodder burden, the total cost is over 800,000 yuan. However, the income from hiring out half a head of livestock from the cooperative for one year is only 864,000 yuan. The result is that they are earning their own money, suffering a lot of trouble for nothing. From the perspective of those farmers who only own one-third or one-quarter of a head of livestock, very few sell cattle labor, and some even cannot cultivate all of their own land, so public ownership of livestock is even more harmless to them. As for those farmers who did not originally own livestock, the livestock price they share due to public ownership of livestock is not much more than the wages they paid for hiring livestock to cultivate their land in previous years. Taking Wang Shouxin of the Heiniugou cooperative as an example, in previous years, using manual labor to exchange for animal labor, ten mu of land required 30 workdays per year, worth 1.5 shi of rice, equivalent to 180,000 yuan. This year, after joining the cooperative, he should share a livestock price of 200,000 yuan (total), with little difference. However, this year, due to the full strength being used in the cooperative, the total income from agricultural and sideline industries increased by 400,000 yuan compared to last year (equivalent to four or five shi of coarse grains). After the livestock price is completely repaid, there is still 200,000 yuan left. This year is only 70% of a normal year (due to autumn drought and strong winds), yet it is still like this. If the years are slightly better in the future, and livestock does not need to be exchanged for manual labor or money, their benefits will naturally be greater.
    From the cooperative's point of view, Baijiagou has already calculated an account: buying the four head of livestock from the cooperative members at market price and comparing it to hiring these four head of livestock, they are now saving 2.362 million yuan. The fodder cost for the four head of livestock is estimated at 4 million yuan, added to the purchase price, the total cost is 8.55 million yuan; deducting the hiring price, it only costs an extra 1.638 million yuan to have four head of livestock. By next year, there will only be feeding costs. The feeding cost is, of course, much lower than the hiring price. According to Baijiagou's calculation, each year four head of livestock will cost 2.912 million yuan less. According to recent calculations by cooperatives such as Xianzhuang, the situation is roughly the same.
    Judging from the feeding and use of livestock, farmers are more willing to have public ownership. The livestock fed in each cooperative this year, with the exception of a few that are sick, are fed fatter and stronger than those fed by individual farmers. The reasons are: First, centralized feeding of livestock makes it easier to supervise and inspect, and the prescribed two sheng of good feed and 15 jin of good grass (special livestock have other regulations) can be reliably fed, without being careless. Second, those responsible for feeding are experienced old farmers (semi-laborers) who are publicly recommended by the cooperative members. Their work tops the highest daily "points," their enthusiasm is very high, and they are naturally better than women and children randomly feeding them in each household. Third, when using livestock to cultivate land or pull carts, it is the responsibility of "experts," who can guarantee a certain cart pulling weight and the number of mu of land cultivated per day, ensuring that they "only use them happily, not exhaust them," and ensuring that they are not broken. Some cooperatives have "experts" who feed and use the livestock themselves (using cooperative fodder), and they feed them very well.
    Public ownership of livestock also avoids many disputes in livestock feeding and use. In cooperatives such as Kangjiazhuang, livestock is privately owned and hired by the cooperative, and friction between public and private always occurs. Livestock owners say: "You broke my livestock, they are sweating." Cooperative members who use livestock say: "We are in a hurry to use the livestock, but you haven't fed them well, delaying things." The Baijiagou cooperative has two livestock owners, who sometimes force the cooperative to postpone cultivation because they want to grind flour themselves. One head of livestock affects another head of livestock's ability to go to the field, remaining idle at home. By October 10th, half of the autumn land should have been turned over, but only a quarter had actually been turned over. The two livestock owners said that the livestock were sick, but they were actually grinding flour at home. The contract originally stipulated that the cooperative came first and the family came second, but this was sometimes not possible. If this situation continues, production will be lost.
    After a year of practice, the public opinion of the cooperative members is: "In our place, public ownership and use of livestock is good. If this method is not suitable in other places, they don't have to use it." Qin Tongxing, the county party secretary, concluded: "As long as the three conditions of 'mass voluntary participation,' 'well-fed livestock,' and 'no debt for the cooperative' are met, livestock can be valued and returned to the cooperative for collective ownership and use. It is wrong to insist that public ownership of livestock is deviation, and it is wrong to force correction."
    Speaking of correction, this does reflect an important problem in our leadership style and work methods. When correcting deviations this spring, some people did not base their decisions on the specific circumstances of each place, correcting what should be corrected and not correcting what should not be corrected; instead, they rigidly applied general principles. What we call hastiness, rashness, and "left" deviation refers to our leading organs setting slogans too high, demanding too quickly, and becoming detached from the masses, which met with opposition from the masses. If, at this time and place, the masses already know that a certain progressive method or system is beneficial and harmless to them, and they have the conditions to implement it, and they automatically rise up to implement it, but we say that this is deviation and rashness, and we insist on correcting it, then what is the point? It is simply dragging the masses back and pulling history backwards. The public ownership of livestock here did not actually start this year. Two years ago, spontaneous "cattle-plowing cooperative groups" appeared. These were mutual aid groups centered on livestock, where all livestock was collectively owned within the group, and everyone cultivated the land. Some were fed separately, some were fed by special personnel. By last winter and this spring, they had developed to about 120 groups. However, when correcting deviations this spring, they insisted that everyone disperse the livestock and return them to private ownership. Many of the masses went to the cadres and said, "We don't care if it's deviation or not, we just feel that it's beneficial, so we'll do it this way. You can't force us to disband." The result was that the masses said, "No matter how you correct it, you can't break it up, it's a secret group." Some were afraid and had to disband. But behind their backs, they complained, "You told us to collectivize and cooperate, and you told us to disband! We don't know what you really want us to do." Once the livestock was dispersed, the mutual aid groups also disintegrated, and some collapsed. The masses' minds were fluctuating and confused, and they were no longer enthusiastic about promoting mutual aid and cooperation.
    It should be said that the correction of deviations this spring played a good role in most areas, stabilizing production enthusiasm, overcoming chaos, stopping rashness, and guiding the mutual aid and cooperation movement onto the right track. In Qin County, the correction of some hasty and rash villages was also very correct, but there were also many villages where what was not biased was indeed treated as biased, resulting in a bad effect. The reason is that they did not handle matters according to specific circumstances and did not respect the opinions and demands of the masses. All localities should learn a lesson from this.

    “不能硬说牲口公有就是偏”
    本报记者　林韦
    今年五月二十三日，“山西农民”报发表了沁县白家沟农业生产合作社计划委员梁三写给该报的一封信。信中说：白家沟崔豹孩农业生产合作社共十六户，内有十二户原来伙养着四头牲口，现已作价四百五十五万元入了社。牲口价钱按全社劳力、土地负担，每户平均应出二十八万多元。原牲口主十二户，每户平均入在社内三十七万多元。四户原没牲口的，每户每年补出九万多元，要在三年内共补出一百一十二万元，还清牲畜价。最近这四户表示只要二年就能还清。但恰在这时，报纸上批评牲口、农具作价入社是犯了急躁冒进的错误，应当改为租用或雇用。该社召开社员大会讨论时，大家计算一下，全社二百四十亩地，全年需要七百二十个畜工。每一畜工按八升米工资计算，全年要付出五十七石六斗（折价六百九十一万二千元，比买价还贵二百三十六万二千元）。所以大家都不愿改为雇用。该社就写信给“山西农民”报，询问在这种情况下是否可以将牲口折价入社，公有公用。
    “山西农民”报的编者按语和正式答复，批驳了这封来信。论点主要是：一、从社的利害上说，除了买价，还有平日喂养费用和管理的问题。二、从牲口主说，把牲口雇给社用或雇给农户使用更为有利。作价入社就损害了牲口主的利益。一般农民要拿出私有的钱粮变为公有，一定会心疼的。公有财产必须从增加农民收入中慢慢积累。三、从原来没牲口的社员说，入社就负债，会影响他们的生产情绪。改为牲口私有以后，虽说因为社内出钱雇牲口要少分些粮，但三年内不负债，也保持了现实利益。结论是：“必须纠正牲口作价入社。”
    一般地说，这些道理是对的。但在沁县这个具体的地方，实践的结果却不能不使人重新研究这一问题。
    沁县当时有五十二个农业生产合作社。后经检查，停办了五个，剩下四十七个。社员的牲口当时都已折价入社，公有公用了。省和专区的检查人员，都认为需要坚决地一律改归私有，由社雇用或租用。但在纠偏中却遇到社员群众的反对。纠了好久，只有五个社改为私有，其余四十二个社仍然一直坚持公有公用。后来因为实在纠不过来，只好不纠了。
    牲口公有的结果，并未影响社员的积极性，社员（包括原来有牲口的和没牲口的）一般生产情绪都很高，因此社里的庄稼也普遍比一般农户好得多。入秋后遭了风灾旱灾，仍然增产一成到三成以上（以去年的丰收年为基准）。
    现在社员们正议论着冬季生产和明年的牲口问题。牲口公有的社，大家仍然愿意公有，没有人愿意改为私有。牲口私有的社，却有两个社已经正式提出意见，要求改为公有。另外三个社现在还没有提出意见，但据说是害怕提出来不顶事；或者现在公有了，将来上级还要来纠偏。
    牲口公有制为什么在其他地区的许多农业生产合作社中现在实行不通，甚至引起垮社危险，在沁县却能顺利实行呢？我最近仔细了解了一下，原来这里有一些特殊的情况：第一、沁县农民历来就有伙养牲口的习惯，多数农户都是三、四家甚至五家伙有一头，好一点的户也是两家伙一头，一家独有一头、两头牲口的极其稀少。据西安庄等五村统计，共二○八户喂养牲口，其中只有十户独有一头，不足百分之五；其余农户都是伙养。第二、养牲口的目的，一般都只是为了种自己的地，而且也只够种自己的地。用牲口搞副业生产的极少，卖牛工的也不多。第三、牲口总数很少，但有一点牲口的农户却很多，很普遍。一般村有牲口户都占到总农户的四分之三甚至五分之四以上。上述五村统计，各村有牲口户占总农户的比重是百分之七十四到九十六。这五村的农业生产合作社中，有牲口户所占比重是百分之八十一到百分之百。第四、牲口绝大部分是牛和驴，每头价值不过几十万元到一百多万元。骡马极少。牛驴的饲养费用（草料费）也比较少，喂好草好料，一年也不过一百万元。
    这些特殊情况使农民觉得：牲口归自己私有，并没有多大的利，只不过能种上自己的庄稼而已；牲口归社公有，也没有什么害——也能种上自己那点庄稼，同时好处还更多一些。按好一点的农户计算，有半头牲口，一年卖上半个月牛工，冬季拉上五、六回煤，也不过收入三、四石粮食（十四斤半一斗）。但交给合作社，一年一户也能按劳动日平均分到这点数目。个人还清闲得多。如果牲口私有私喂，雇给社使用，半头牲口要喂四、五十万元的草料，要夜里喂牲口，还要摊出雇牲口的费用。以白家沟崔豹孩社计算，一年雇四个牲口的总费用是六百九十一万二千元。十六户分摊，一户平均要摊四十三万多元。加上上述草料负担，共需八十多万元。而半头牲口一年从社所得的雇价，也不过八十六万四千元。结果是自己赚自己，白受许多麻烦。从那些只有三分之一或四分之一头牲口的农户看，卖牛工的极少，有的甚至种不完自己土地，公有牲口对他们更无害处。至于那些原来没牲口的农户，因牲口公有而摊的牲口价，比往年雇牲口耕地所出工资也多不了几文。以黑牛沟社的王守信为例，往年用人工换畜工，十亩地一年要付出三十个工，值一石五斗米，折价十八万元。今年入社后应摊牲口价是二十万元（全部），相差无几。但今年由于全部力量用在社里，农副业总收入比去年增加四十万元（合四、五石杂粮）。牲口价全部还清，还剩二十万元。今年和去年相比，只是七成年景（因秋旱和大风），尚且如此，以后年成如果稍好一点，牲口又不要用人工或钱来换了，他们的好处当然会更大。
    从社的方面来看，白家沟已经算出一个账：按市价买入社员的四个牲口，和雇用这四个牲口相比，现在就少花二百三十六万二千元。四个牲口的草料费共以四百万元计，加以买价，共需八百五十五万元；除去雇价，只多出一百六十三万八千元，就有了四头牲口。到明年，就只有饲养费了。饲养费当然比雇价少得多。按白家沟计算，一年四个牲口就要少出二百九十一万二千元。近据西安庄等社计算，情形也大抵如此。
    从牲口喂养和使用的情形看，农民更乐意公有。各社今年所喂牲口，除个别有病者外，都比一般农户喂得肥壮，有力气。原因是：一、集中喂牲口容易监督、检查，规定的二升好料和十五斤好草（特殊牲口另有规定）能确实喂到，没有马虎。二、负责喂养的是社员公推出来的富有喂牲口经验的老农（半劳力）。他们的工作顶每日最高“分”，情绪很高，比各农户由妇女、孩子乱喂自然要好。三、使用牲口耕地拉车时，是由“行家”负专责，他能保证一定的拉车重量和每日耕地亩数，保证“只使欢，不使乏”，保证使不坏。有的社由“行家”自使自喂（用社内草料），喂得也很好。
    公有牲口还避免了牲口喂养和使用上的许多纠纷。康家庄等社牲口私有，由社雇用，公私磨擦总是不断发生。牲口主说：“你们把俺牲口使坏了，出汗了。”使用牲口的社员说：“我们急着要使用牲口，你还没有喂好，误了事了。”白家沟社有两个牲口主，有时因为自己要磨面，迫使社里不得不延期耕作，一个牲口牵扯着另一个牲口不能下地，闲在家里。到十月十日，应该垡完一半秋地了，实际却只垡了四分之一。两家牲口主说是牲口生病，实际却在家里磨面。合同原定先社后家，实际有时就办不到。这种情形继续下去，生产会受到损失的。
    经过一年的实践，社员群众的舆论是：“在咱这地方，牲口就是公有公用好。别的地方要是用这办法不合适，他们可以不用。”县委书记秦统兴作的结论是：“只要具备了‘群众自愿’、‘牲口养好’、‘社不负债’这三个条件，牲口就可以折价归社，公有公用。不能硬说牲口公有就是偏，硬来纠。”
    说到纠偏，这里的确反映了我们领导作风和工作方法上一个重要问题。今春纠偏时，有一些人并不是根据各地具体情况，该纠的纠，不该纠的不纠；而是用一般的原则去硬套。我们所说的急躁冒进和“左”的偏向，是说我们领导机关提口号提得太高，要求太急，脱离了群众，遭到了群众反对。如果此时此地的群众已经知道了某种进步的办法或制度对自己有好处，没坏处，已有实行的条件，并且自动起来实行了，我们却说这是偏向、冒进，硬要去纠，那还有什么意义呢？只是拉群众的后腿，拉着历史倒退罢了。这里的牲口公有，其实并非从今年开始。二年以前，就有自发的“耕牛合作组”出现了。这是一种以牲口为结合中心的互助组，所有牲口都是组内公有，给大家种地。有的分开喂，有的专人喂。到去冬今春，已经发展到一百二十来组。但在今春纠偏时，却又硬要人家都把牲口分散，归各家私有。许多群众找干部说：“俺不管偏不偏，反正俺们觉着有利，就这样干。你们不能强迫俺们散伙。”结果是群众说的：“怎纠也纠不开，明散暗伙。”也有的害怕，只好散了。但在背后却埋怨说：“叫集体、叫互助是你们，叫散伙也是你们！不知道你们究竟是要俺怎哩。”牲口分散了，互助组也跟着涣散起来，有一些就垮了。群众心里忽二忽三，摸不着头脑，再宣传互助合作，他们也不积极了。
    应该说，今春的纠偏在大部地区是起了好的作用，安定了生产情绪，克服了混乱，制止了冒进，把互助合作运动引上了正确的轨道。在沁县，对于一部分急躁冒进的村庄也纠得很对，但也有不少村庄的确是把不偏的也当成偏来纠了，结果起了坏的作用。原因是没有按具体情况办事，不尊重群众的意见和要求。各地应该记取这一教训。
