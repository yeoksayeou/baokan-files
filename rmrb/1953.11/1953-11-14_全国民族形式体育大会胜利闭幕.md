    The 1953 National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Games successfully concluded on the afternoon of December 12th. This conference lasted five days and held ten performances and competitions, including martial arts, folk sports, equestrian skills, as well as competition events like weightlifting, boxing, target shooting, wrestling, and fencing. There were over 120,000 spectators.

    Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, delivered the closing address at the conference. He pointed out that this conference reviewed many outstanding martial arts, folk sports, and equestrian skills. The performances of these sports fully demonstrated the rich and diverse nature of ethnic sports in our country, and showcased the excellent traditions of diligence, bravery, and the creative spirit of the working people of all ethnic groups in our country. Rong Gaotang said that this conference was the first grand gathering in the history of national ethnic sports. During the entire performance and competition, the athletes demonstrated a good sporting spirit of close unity, mutual learning, discipline, and obedience to organization. He said that this conference laid a good foundation for the correct development of national ethnic sports in our country. However, from the perspective of the overall situation of national ethnic sports in our country, it has been deeply influenced by the old feudal ruling class. Therefore, further excavation, research, and consolidation of various ethnic sports projects is still a very arduous task. Rong Gaotang finally called on all athletes to return to their work posts, carry forward the excellent style of this conference, learn with humility, improve their skills, and strive to improve their political awareness to better serve the health of the people and the economic and national defense construction.

    After the Deputy Chief Conductor of the conference, Zhu Debao, announced the competition results, awards were presented. When the gold, silver, bronze, and tungsten medals were hung on the chests of the winning athletes, the audience burst into warm applause. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国民族形式体育大会胜利闭幕
    一九五三年全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会，已于十二日下午胜利闭幕。这次大会共进行了五天，举行了十场表演和竞赛，包括武术、民间体育、骑术等项目，和举重、拳击、步射、摔跤、击剑等竞赛项目。观众有十二万多人。
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠在大会上致闭幕词。他指出：这次大会检阅了许多出色的武术、民间体育、骑术等项目。这些体育项目的演出，充分说明我国民族形式体育的丰富多采，并显示出我国各族劳动人民勤劳、勇敢的优良传统和富有创造性的精神。荣高棠说：这次大会是全国民族形式体育界有史以来的第一次大会师，运动员在整个表演和竞赛中，都表现了亲密团结，互相学习，遵守纪律，服从组织的良好的体育道德作风。他说：这次大会为正确地发展我国民族形式体育打下了良好的基础。但是，从我国整个民族形式体育的状况来说，它受旧的封建统治阶级的影响是很深的，因此，进一步发掘、研究和整理各种民族形式体育项目，还是件十分艰巨的工作。荣高棠最后号召全体运动员回到工作岗位后，发扬这次大会的优良作风，虚心学习，改进技术，并努力提高政治觉悟，更好地为增进人民的健康、为经济建设与国防建设服务。
