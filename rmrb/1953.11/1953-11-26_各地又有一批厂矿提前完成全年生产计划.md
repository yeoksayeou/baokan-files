In addition to the factories and mines already reported by this newspaper as having overfulfilled their annual production plans, another batch of state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines across the country have completed their annual state production plans forty-one to seventy days ahead of schedule. These factories and mines include: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium Rolling Mill and Cast Pipe Plant, Anshan Riveting Factory, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Shenyang Dyeing and Finishing Factory, Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, Dalian Light Bulb Factory, Dalian Dyeing and Finishing Factory, Liaoxi Fur Factory, Chifeng Fur Processing Factory, Rehe Ephedrine Factory, Beijing Building Materials Company's Metal Structure Factory, Tianjin Telecommunications Equipment Factory, Jinan Tannery, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, Tianjin Third Printing and Dyeing Factory, Tianjin Woolen Mill, Tianjin Knitting Factory, Tianjin Cigarette Factory, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Nanjing Machine Tool Plant, Xuzhou Liguo Iron Mine, Anhui Ma'anshan Iron Plant (formerly known as Iron Ore Plant), Xiangshan Pyrite Mine, Yunnan Tin Company's Gejiu Concentrator, Pingxiang Mining Bureau's Longhu Mine, Xi'an Mining Bureau's Fuguo No. 2 Pit, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant, Wuhan Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's Passenger Car Workshop, Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory, Tangshan Steel Plant's Guye Refractory Materials Department, and Suiyuan Province's Guancun Mica Factory, etc.

    Many of these factories and mines have completed their plans relatively comprehensively. For example, in addition to completing the output plan fifty-two days ahead of schedule, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant completed the profit delivery and output value plan by the end of October, and the cost was also reduced by 7.8% compared with the original plan. In addition to completing the output plan ahead of schedule, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory's labor productivity increased by an average of 4.4% compared with the plan, and the cost was reduced by 5% compared with the plan. In addition, Yingcheng Coal Mine has completed its annual tunneling task 58 days ahead of schedule. In addition to completing the annual crude oil production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule, Yumen Mining Bureau's refinery also completed the annual production plans for major products such as gasoline and kerosene ahead of schedule. Fushun Mining Bureau and Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory completed their annual profit delivery plans ahead of schedule. By the end of October, Jingxi Mining Bureau had completed its annual savings plan.

    The main reasons why these factories and mines completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule are: First, all employees have shown a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in the first year of the country's Five-Year Construction Plan. Especially after the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the employees of various factories and mines have exerted a high degree of production enthusiasm and rich wisdom. The workers of Fuguo No. 2 Pit of Xi'an Mining Bureau, based on Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling experience and the Soviet Guo Luowen's rapid tunneling experience, created a four-shift multi-hole division of labor streamlined rapid tunneling method, which made the tunneling progress keep up with the needs of coal mining and ensured the early completion of the annual production plan. Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, all tunneling workers in Yingcheng Coal Mine have launched a competition. In October, nineteen teams, including Luan Daobin and Wang Chunshan, completed their annual tunneling tasks ahead of schedule. Three rapid tunneling teams, Liu Zhendong, Gao Zicai, and Feng Jincai, reached the rapid standards set by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration. Yunnan Tin Company's Gejiu Concentrator's production situation in the first half of this year was not good. After July, employees actively put forward rationalization proposals, solved two key production problems such as grinding fineness and classification, improved the output and quality of ore, and completed the annual production plan seventy days ahead of schedule. The second is that the employees of various factories and mines have conscientiously implemented the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant mobilized employees to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, twenty-eight of the thirty-five lathes in the electric motor workshop were converted into lathes suitable for promoting high-speed cutting or rapid cutting, and 75% of the lathe operators learned high-speed cutting methods, which increased the cutting efficiency of the lathes by about four times. Last October, the factory averaged only 1.06 motors produced per worker, while this October, an average of 3.68 units can be produced per person, an increase of 2.47 times. After the mold casting workshop promoted four decisive advanced experiences such as one mold and multiple castings, the efficiency increased by more than two times. Third, various factories and mines have strengthened plan management. Originally, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant was chaotic in management, and many products were reworked and scrapped. In the first quarter of this year, the factory leaders, according to the characteristics of the factory's products with many parts, many processes, long cycles, and strict quality requirements, and the principle that all processed parts must obey the needs of assembled finished products, with the machine workshop as the focus, compiled operation plans for the size, order, priority, and secondary of processing parts; and strengthened technical and organizational measures around the implementation of the operation plan; reviewed and revised drawings, unified quality standards, unified inspection measuring tools, tools and chucks; adjusted the labor organization; revised quotas; and strengthened scheduling work, the production outlook has been completely renewed. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the factory further organized balanced production with the operation plan as the center. And initially established a responsibility system for plan compilation, inspection, scheduling, supply and quality; strengthened quota management; and promoted instruction charts. This ensures that the plan is overfulfilled every month, and the commodity equilibrium rate is above 80% every month.

    This batch of factories and mines that have completed their annual production plans have made great contributions to the country's construction and the needs of farmers. Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's product this year is an eight-inch all-gear lathe for mechanical industry cutting. This lathe has been exhibited in the German Democratic Republic, Leipzig International Fair and other places. Now, all the products of the factory that have completed the plan ahead of schedule have been shipped to machine factories in Northeast, East China and other places for application. The hexagonal lathes, drilling machines, and thread machine tools with sophisticated technology produced by Nanjing Machine Tool Plant have also been supplied to many industrial and mining departments in Northeast, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang. The price of chemical fertilizers supplied by Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory to the vast number of farmers is also much lower than last year. Now, the employees of these factories and mines are stepping up efforts to improve production efficiency and strive to create more wealth for the country. The employees of Longhu Mine of Pingxiang Mining Bureau have the confidence to increase production and save 4.53 billion yuan for the country within the year. The employees of the pyrite mine of Ma'anshan Iron Plant are preparing to increase the production of ore equivalent to 18% of the annual plan within the year. The employees of Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant also strive to increase the production of 59 lathes for the country by the end of the year.

    各地又有一批厂矿提前完成全年生产计划
    除本报前已报道的已超额完成全年生产计划的各厂矿外，全国各地又有一批国营和地方国营厂矿提前四十一天到七十天完成了全年国家生产计划。这些厂矿包括：鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂及铸管厂、鞍山铆造厂、沈阳水泵厂、沈阳染整厂、沈阳矿山机器厂、大连灯泡厂、大连染整厂、辽西皮毛厂、赤峰皮毛加工厂、热河麻黄素厂、北京建筑器材公司金属结构工厂、天津电讯器材厂、津南制革厂、天津自行车厂、天津第三印染厂、天津毛织厂、天津针织厂、天津卷烟厂、济南第一机床厂、南京机床厂、徐州利国铁矿、安徽马鞍山铁厂（原称铁矿厂）、向山硫化铁矿厂、云南锡业公司个旧选矿厂、萍乡矿务局龙虎矿和西安矿务局富国二坑、湘潭电机厂、武汉江岸机车车辆修理工厂客车间、唐山启新磁厂、唐山钢厂古冶耐火材料部、绥远省官村云母厂等。其中有很多厂矿计划完成得比较全面。如济南第一机床厂除提前五十二天完成产量计划外，上缴利润、产值计划在十月底就完成了，成本也比原计划减低了百分之七点八。天津自行车厂除提前完成产量计划外，劳动生产率平均比计划提高了百分之四点四，成本比计划减低了百分之五。此外，营城煤矿已提前五十八天完成了全年掘进任务。玉门矿务局除提前两个半月完成全年原油生产计划外，炼油厂也提前完成主要产品汽油、煤油的全年生产计划。抚顺矿务局和抚顺石油一厂提前完成了全年上缴利润计划。京西矿务局到十月底已完成了全年节约计划。
    这些厂矿提前完成全年生产计划的主要原因：第一，是全体职工在国家五年建设的第一年中，表现了高度的积极性和创造精神。特别在增产节约运动开展后，各厂矿职工更发挥了高度的生产热情和丰富的智慧。西安矿务局富国二坑的职工，根据崔国山快速掘进经验和苏联郭洛温的快速掘进经验，创造了四班多孔分工种流水快速掘进法，使掘进进度赶上了采煤的需要，保证提前完成了全年生产计划。营城煤矿自开展增产节约运动后，全矿掘进工种全体工人展开了竞赛，十月份栾道彬、王春善等十九个小组提前完成了全年掘进任务。刘振东、高子才、冯金财等三个快速掘进队达到东北煤矿管理局提出的快速标准。云南锡业公司个旧选矿厂今年上半年的生产情况并不好，七月份以后，职工积极提合理化建议，解决了磨矿的碎度和分级等两个生产中的关键问题，提高了矿石的产量和质量，提前七十天完成了全年的生产计划。第二是各厂矿职工认真贯彻了苏联的先进经验。湘潭电机厂发动职工学习苏联先进经验后，电机车间三十五部车床中，有二十八部改装成了适宜于推行高速切削或快速切削的车床，并有百分之七十五的车工学会了高速切削法，使车床的切削效率提高了四倍左右。去年十月该厂平均每个工人只能生产电机一点零六台，今年十月，平均每人可生产三点六八台，提高了二点四七倍。型铸车间推广了一模多铸法等四项有决定性的先进经验后，效率提高了两倍以上。第三，各厂矿加强了计划管理。济南第一机床厂原来由于管理混乱，生产品返工，报废的很多。今年第一季度，该厂领导干部根据本厂产品零件多、工序多、周期长、质量要求严格等特点及一切加工零件必须服从装配成品需要的原则，以机工车间为重点，分别加工零件的大小、先后、主次编制了作业计划；并围绕贯彻作业计划，加强了技术和组织措施；进行了审查修正图纸、统一质量标准、统一检验量具、工具和卡具；调整了劳动组织；修订了定额；并加强了调度工作，生产面貌焕然一新。增产节约运动开展后，该厂又进一步以作业计划为中心，组织均衡生产。并初步建立了编制计划、检验、调度、供应和质量等责任制度；加强了定额管理；推行了指示图表。这样就保证了月月超额完成计划，商品均衡率每月都在百分之八十以上。
    这批完成全年生产计划的厂矿，对国家的建设和农民的需要贡献很大。济南第一机床厂今年的产品是机械工业切削用的八吋全齿轮车床，这种车床曾先后在民主德国、来比锡国际博览会等处展览过。现在，该厂提前完成计划的全部产品已先后运往东北、华东等地机器工厂应用。南京机床厂生产的六角车床、钻床、螺纹机车技术精良的工作母机，也已供给东北、上海、武汉、重庆、太原、兰州、西安、广州以及新疆等地许多工矿部门应用。抚顺石油一厂供给广大农民需用的化学肥料的价格，也比去年降低了很多。现在这些厂矿职工正加紧提高生产效率，争取为国家创造更多财富。萍乡矿务局龙虎矿职工有信心在年内再为国家增产节约四十五亿三千万元。马鞍山铁厂硫化铁矿场职工，准备在年内再增产相当于全年计划百分之十八的矿石。济南第一机床厂职工也争取到年底再为国家增产五十九台车床。
