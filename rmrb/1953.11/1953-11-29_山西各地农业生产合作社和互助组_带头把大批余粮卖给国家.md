Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Shanxi Province, after thoroughly carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and vigorously promoting the Party's general line for the transition period, have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have taken the lead in selling large quantities of grain to the state in an organized manner, fully demonstrating the advanced role of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various parts of Shanxi Province are not only superior to ordinary farmers in production, but also play a model leading role in responding to the call of the Party and the government. After reading the editorial in this newspaper, “Increase Production, Increase Income, Practice Strict Economy, Tighten Expenditures, and Overfulfill the State Plan,” the Zhao Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chenjiazhuang, Datong, promptly studied and discussed it, and formulated a plan to increase production, practice economy, and sell surplus grain to the state. After hearing the call to sell surplus grain to the state, the Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dazhai Village, Yu County, was the first in the whole village to sell wheat to the state. The exemplary actions of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in selling large quantities of surplus grain to the state have motivated ordinary farmers to actively sell grain to the state as well. The Liu Qunhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiyan Village, Jincheng, sold 10,290 jin of wheat and soybeans to the state, driving 58 peasant households in the village to sell 4,500 jin of wheat and 10,808 jin of miscellaneous grains. The labor model Jing Changyuan Mutual Aid Team in Dongbao Village, Yi County, sold 10,085 jin of surplus grain to the state, driving the masses of the whole village to formulate plans to increase production and practice economy and sell 5,500 jin of wheat to the state.

The grain sold by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is mostly large in quantity and good in quality. One agricultural production cooperative and three mutual aid teams in Jingshang Village, He Shun, sold 29,844 jin of grain to the state, accounting for 56.2 percent of the grain sold by all other households in the village. The average yield of autumn crops per mu in the Gou Faxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Quzhai Village, Changzhi, was 366 jin and 11 liang, which was 43 jin and 3 liang more per mu than the best mutual aid team in the village. The whole cooperative sold 13,000 jin of grain to the state, which was the largest amount of grain sold in the whole village. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams sold more than 10,000 jin or 5,000 jin of grain. The Wang He Agricultural Production Cooperative in Niujialing Village, Shuo County, sold 40 shi of wheat and 150 shi of miscellaneous grains to the state, a total of 190 shi. The Zhao Shuitong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liuze Village, Huguan, sold 21,600 jin of grain.

Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various parts of Shanxi Province are generally able to quickly and systematically invest the money they get from selling grain to expand reproduction. For example, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Xiangyang, Lancun and other villages in the suburbs of Taiyuan City signed six collective grain sales contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, selling a total of 234,500 jin of grain to the state and ordering a large number of means of production. The Gou Faxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Quzhai Village, Changzhi, had already made a plan before selling the grain. In addition to repaying the fertilizer loan from the credit cooperative, they would buy a walking plow, 300 jin of fertilizer powder, and 1,000 jin of bean cake. Four agricultural production cooperatives, including Han Yinfa's, and twenty-five mutual aid teams, including Wu Baocang's, in Lingchuan, signed joint contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives, buying back means of production and means of livelihood worth a total of 32.62 million yuan after selling grain. All of this will guarantee increased agricultural production next year.

    山西各地农业生产合作社和互助组
    带头把大批余粮卖给国家
    山西省深入展开增产节约运动，大张旗鼓地展开国家在过渡时期的总路线的宣传以后，大大鼓舞了广大农民把余粮卖给国家的积极性。各地农业生产合作社和互助组带头有组织地把大批粮食卖给国家，充分显示了农业生产合作社和互助组的先进作用。
    山西各地农业生产合作社和互助组不仅在生产上优越于一般农民，在响应党和政府的号召中，也都起了模范带头作用。大同陈家庄赵喜顺农业生产合作社看到本报“增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支、超额完成国家计划”的社论以后，及时进行了学习讨论，订出增产节约、把余粮卖给国家的计划；榆社大寨村张志全农业生产合作社听到把余粮卖给国家的号召以后，在全村中最先把小麦卖给国家。农业生产合作社和互助组大量把余粮卖给国家的模范行动，带动一般农民也积极把粮食卖给国家。晋城西掩村刘群孩农业生产合作社卖给国家小麦、大豆一万零二百九十斤，带动全村五十八户农民卖出小麦四千五百斤、杂粮一万八百零八斤。猗氏东堡村劳动模范景长元互助组卖给国家余粮一万零八十五斤，带动全村群众订出增产节约计划，把五千五百斤小麦卖给国家。
    农业生产合作社和互助组卖的粮食大多是数量多、质量好。和顺京上村一个农业生产合作社和三个互助组，卖给国家二万九千八百四十四斤粮食，占全村其他各户出卖粮食数的百分之五十六点二。长治璩寨村苟发兴农业生产合作社秋地每亩平均产粮三百六十六斤十一两，比本村最好的互助组每亩多产粮四十三斤三两。全社卖给国家一万三千斤粮食，是全村卖粮最多的单位。许多农业生产合作社和互助组卖粮数量，都在一万斤、五千斤以上；朔县牛家岭村王和农业生产合作社卖给国家小麦四十石、杂粮一百五十石，共一百九十石；壶关流泽村赵水同农业生产合作社售粮二万一千六百斤。
    山西各地农业生产合作社和互助组在卖粮后一般都能很快地有计划地把卖粮得到的钱投资扩大再生产。如太原市郊区向阳、兰村等村农业生产合作社、互助组和供销合作社订了六份集体售粮合同，共卖给国家二十三万四千五百斤粮食，订购了大批生产资料。长治璩寨村苟发兴农业生产合作社在卖粮前即订下计划，除还信用合作社肥料贷款外，要买一张步犁、三百斤肥田粉，一千斤豆饼。陵川韩银法等四个农业生产合作社和吴保仓等二十五个互助组，和供销合作社订了结合合同，卖粮后买回的生产资料和生活资料，共值三千二百六十二万元。这都将对明年农业增产起保证作用。
