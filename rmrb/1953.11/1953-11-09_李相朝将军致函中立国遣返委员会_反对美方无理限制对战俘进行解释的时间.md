Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th—General Li Xiangchao wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 7th, pointing out that the amount of time spent explaining to each prisoner of war and the number of prisoners of war explained to each day are entirely matters to be decided by the explaining representatives based on the actual situation. There is no reason to force the Korean and Chinese side to complete the explanation to all prisoners of war in one camp at one time.

General Li Xiangchao pointed out: It is absolutely necessary to build some more camps in order to isolate those prisoners of war who have been explained to from those who have not, in accordance with Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work." However, considering the difficulties of the Indian Custodial Forces, the Korean and Chinese side agreed not to explain to prisoners of war in other camps before completing the explanation work for all prisoners of war in one camp.

General Li Xiangchao emphasized: Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" are precisely for the purpose of guaranteeing the rights of the explaining party. These rights must not be violated.

In order to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations and requesting repatriation, the U.S. side has recently launched a propaganda offensive, opposing giving prisoners of war a few hours to listen to explanations to eliminate the fear they have developed under the U.S. side's control, intimidation, and deception over the past three years. The U.S. side is putting pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, demanding that the Korean and Chinese side be forced to complete individual explanations to all approximately five hundred prisoners of war in at least one camp each day, thereby limiting the time spent explaining to individual prisoners of war. The Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission openly supports this plan of the U.S. side. According to American journalists, the Swiss member even threatened to sabotage the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by "withdrawing."

At the same time, Kuomintang secret agents under American command in Camp No. 22 continue to carry out the U.S. side's plan to sabotage the explanation work, preventing prisoners of war who have not listened to explanations from coming out on the 6th. Some of the prisoners of war in this camp had not had time to listen to the explanation on the 5th, but were sent back to their original camp. On the 4th, some prisoners of war in Camp No. 28 who had not had time to listen to the explanation were also sent back to their original camp. Therefore, this is the second time that the provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" have not been observed. The fact that prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 who have not listened to the explanation are prevented from coming out to listen to the explanation by secret agents is one of the results of doing so.

### 李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会  反对美方无理限制对战俘进行解释的时间

    李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会
    反对美方无理限制对战俘进行解释的时间
   【新华社开城八日电】李相朝将军七日写信给中立国遣返委员会，指出：对每个战俘进行多少时间的解释和每天对多少战俘进行解释，完全是由解释代表根据实际情况加以决定的事。没有任何理由可以强迫朝中方面一次完成对一个营场的全部战俘的解释。
    李相朝将军指出：另外再建造一些营场以便按照“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款规定把那些已经解释的战俘和未经解释的战俘隔离，是绝对必要的。但是，朝中方面考虑到印度看管部队的困难，因此同意在没有对一个营场的全部战俘完成解释工作之前，不对其他营场的战俘进行解释。
    李相朝将军强调指出：“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款以及“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款，正是为了保障解释一方的权利而规定的。这些权利绝对不容侵犯。
    美方为了阻止战俘听取解释和要求遣返，最近发动了一个宣传攻势，反对给予战俘区区几小时听取解释的时间以消除他们三年来在美方的控制、恫吓和欺骗下所产生的恐惧。美方正在对中立国遣返委员会施行压力，要求迫使朝中方面每天至少要完成对一个营场全部约五百名战俘的个别解释工作，这样来限制对个别战俘进行解释的时间。中立国遣返委员会的瑞士委员公开支持美方这个计划，据美国记者报道，瑞士委员竟扬言要以“退出”来破坏中立国遣返委员会。
    同时，第二十二号营场中美国指挥下的国民党特务，继续执行美方破坏解释工作的计划，在六日阻止未曾听取解释的战俘出来。这个营场中的一部分战俘，在五日未及听取解释，但被送回原来营场。在四日，第二十八号营场也有一部分未及听取解释的战俘被送回原来营场。因此，这已是“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定第二次未被遵守。第二十二号营场中未听取解释的战俘受特务阻挠不能出来听取解释，就是这样做的结果之一。
