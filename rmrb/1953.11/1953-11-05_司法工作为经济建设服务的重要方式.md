    An Important Way for Judicial Work to Serve Economic Construction
    Lin Hong
    With the active assistance of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee and the Tianjin Railway Administration, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court and People's Procuratorate recently established the first specialized court and specialized procuratorate along the Tianjin railway line in the country. The establishment of this specialized court and specialized procuratorate is of great significance in the construction of our people's judicial work. Through such an organizational form, the people's judicial work will more effectively serve the country's economic construction.
    In the past few years, our people's courts and procuratorial organs have actively participated in various social reform movements, severely suppressed the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, and effectively maintained revolutionary order and the democratic rights of the people. As our country has entered a period of planned economic construction, their main task should be to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction from the judicial perspective. Therefore, as early as the Second National Judicial Conference held in April this year, it was decided that the people's judicial organs in various regions should, in a planned and focused manner, gradually establish specialized courts in industrial and mining areas and along railway and waterway lines to specifically handle counter-revolutionary sabotage cases, corruption and theft cases related to industry, mining, railways, and waterways, as well as responsibility accidents caused by passive slowdowns, dereliction of duty resulting in significant losses to production or state property, and endangering the safety of employees.
    The establishment of such specialized courts and procuratorial institutions is one of the necessary organizational forms for the people's judicial work to serve the cause of national economic construction more effectively. We should clearly recognize that although our country has achieved a great victory in the people's democratic revolution and has entered a period of construction, due to the continued existence of imperialism and the occupation of Taiwan by the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they will inevitably try every possible means to create disturbances and sabotage, especially undermining our country's economic construction. Comrade Stalin once instructed us: "The greater our progress and the more victories we achieve, the more ferocious the remnants of the defeated exploiting classes will become, and the more they will adopt sharper forms of struggle. They will disrupt the Soviet state more and more, and they will seize the most desperate means of struggle for a final struggle." At the same time, it should be emphasized that under the leadership and education of our Party and the People's Government over the years, especially after the successive social reform movements, although the political consciousness of the people and the broad masses of workers has been significantly improved, due to the old habits and customs left over from the old society that have not yet been eradicated, as well as the carelessness in management and serious bureaucracy, it is possible that some major responsibility accidents caused by passive slowdowns, dereliction of duty, and violations of labor discipline may occur in our economic construction departments. All of this clearly shows that today, when the country has entered a period of planned economic construction, it is extremely important to further consolidate the people's revolutionary legal system and further improve judicial work. However, because various political or liability accidents that occur in industrial and mining, railway and water transport and other enterprise sectors are closely linked to production technology, it is very difficult for judicial cadres who do not understand certain production technology and do not have certain economic knowledge to correctly handle these cases; at the same time, because our various economic construction tasks are very tense, if these cases are sent to the county and city people's courts for handling, it will inevitably hinder the normal progress of economic construction to a certain extent. Therefore, the establishment of specialized courts and specialized procuratorates is completely necessary and correct. Because in this way, on the one hand, judicial cadres can gradually learn and master the necessary production technology and economic knowledge, and at the same time, they can rely on local enterprise leadership departments and the broad masses of employees to promptly discover and correctly handle all criminal acts that hinder the smooth progress of the country's economic construction.
    The establishment of the specialized court and specialized procuratorate along the Tianjin railway line has created a good start for our people's judicial organs to carry out their business in industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments. Before its establishment, the Tianjin Railway Line Specialized Court had accepted 24 cases of counter-revolution, theft, corruption, and traffic accidents, and sentenced two cases after its official establishment. This will inevitably have a positive effect on improving transportation work along the Tianjin railway line and educating the broad masses of employees to abide by national laws and labor discipline. In particular, the verdict in the case of Bai Fengqi's violation of operating procedures causing a major accident deserves to be learned from by all employees in the transportation sector and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. Our Party and the People's Government have always been serious about consolidating labor discipline in industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments. We adhere to the policy of education for those who make general mistakes and adopt methods of mass criticism and self-criticism; however, those who seriously violate labor discipline or repeatedly fail to correct their mistakes and cause major accidents must be regarded as a criminal act and dealt with seriously in accordance with the laws of the state. Because this kind of major liability accident caused by passive slowdowns and dereliction of duty, although different in nature from the acts of sabotage by counter-revolutionaries, objectively also harms the interests of the state and the people and undermines the country's economic construction. Therefore, the people's judicial organs, in the future, must strictly deal with counter-revolutionaries who create political accidents; at the same time, they must also pay strict attention to major liability accidents and give appropriate punishment to the criminals according to the severity of the circumstances. The purpose of doing so is also to better educate the broad masses of employees to consciously abide by the laws and labor discipline of the state, so that the country's economic construction can proceed smoothly.
    Ensuring the smooth progress of national economic construction from the court and procuratorial work has increasingly become an important task of judicial organs at all levels. Since the Second National Judicial Conference, the people's courts in many places have dispatched circuit tribunals to go deep into rural and industrial and mining areas to handle cases. Some places have also begun to pilot the work of establishing specialized courts and comrade trial associations in industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, which has played a significant role in ensuring normal production order. At present, the people of the whole country have universally launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy in order to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the first year of the five-year construction plan. The task of the people's courts and procuratorial organs is to fight against all acts that hinder the smooth progress of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, all regions that are piloting or have established specialized courts and specialized procuratorates should, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, with the assistance of relevant industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, rely on and go deep among the broad masses of employees to earnestly do this work well; at the same time, they should accumulate and sum up experience so as to continuously improve their work and provide reference and learning for other regions to carry out this work in the future. All regions that have not yet started piloting the establishment of specialized courts and specialized procuratorates should plan to select cadres and focus on going deep into industrial and mining areas and transportation enterprises to conduct pilot construction, and gain experience for promotion.

    司法工作为经济建设服务的重要方式
    林洪
    天津市人民法院和人民检察署，在中央政法委员会和天津铁路管理局的积极协助之下，已于日前在天津铁路沿线成立了全国第一个专门法院和专门检察署。这个专门法院和专门检察署的成立，在我国人民司法工作的建设上具有重大意义，通过这样的组织形式，必将使人民司法工作更为有效地为国家的经济建设服务。
    我们的人民法院和检察机关，在过去几年中曾积极地参加了各项社会改革运动，严厉地镇压了反革命分子的破坏活动，有效地维护了革命秩序和人民的民主权利。在我们的国家已进入有计划的经济建设的时期，它们的主要任务则应是从司法方面保障经济建设工作的顺利进行。因此，早在今年四月召开的第二届全国司法会议上就决定，各地人民司法机关今后应有计划有重点地逐步建立工矿区和铁路、水运沿线的专门法院，专门处理与工矿、铁路和水运有关的反革命破坏案件、贪污和盗窃案件以及因消极怠工、玩忽职守致使生产或国家财产蒙受重大损失和危害职工安全的责任事故。
    这种专门法院和检察机构的设立，是人民司法工作更为有效地为国家经济建设事业服务的必要组织形式之一。我们应该明确地认识到，我们的国家虽已取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利并已进入了建设时期，然而由于帝国主义还存在，蒋介石残余匪帮还盘据着台湾，他们必然会千方百计地进行捣乱和破坏，特别是破坏我国的经济建设事业。斯大林同志曾经指示我们：“我们进展愈大，获得的胜利愈多，则被击溃了的剥削阶级残余将愈加凶恶，他们将愈要采用更尖锐的斗争形式，他们将愈要和苏联国家捣乱，他们将愈要抓紧最拼命的斗争手段来作最后的挣扎。”同时还应着重指出，几年来在我们党和人民政府的领导和教育之下，特别是经过了历次的社会改革运动，我国人民和广大职工群众的政治觉悟虽已有了显著的提高，然而由于旧社会遗留下来的旧的习气、习惯、还未肃清，以及由于管理工作上的漫不经心和严重的官僚主义，在我们的经济建设部门中，就有可能发生一些因消极怠工、玩忽职守和违犯劳动纪律所造成的重大责任事故。这一切都清楚地说明，在国家已进入计划经济建设时期的今天，进一步巩固人民革命的法制，进一步健全司法工作，是极其重要的。但是由于在工矿、铁路和水运等企业部门中发生的各种政治事故或责任事故，都是紧密地和生产技术联系着，司法干部不懂得一定的生产技术，没有具备一定的经济知识，要正确地处理这些案件是很困难的；同时由于我们的各项经济建设工作都是很紧张的，如果把这些案件都送到县、市人民法院去处理，必然在一定程度上妨碍经济建设工作的正常进行。因此，建立专门法院和专门检察署是完全必要的和正确的。因为这样，一方面可以使司法工作干部逐步学会和掌握必要的生产技术和经济知识，同时又能就近依靠当地的企业领导部门和广大职工群众，及时发现和正确处理一切有碍于国家经济建设事业顺利进行的犯罪行为。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署的成立，已为我们的人民司法机关在工矿企业和交通运输部门中开展自己的业务创立了一个良好的开端。天津铁路沿线专门法院在成立前，已受理了反革命、盗窃、贪污和行车事故等二十四个案件，在正式成立后又宣判了两个案件。这对于改进天津铁路沿线的交通运输工作，对于教育广大职工群众遵守国家法律和劳动纪律，必将发生良好的作用。特别是白凤岐违反操作规程造成重大事故案的宣判，更值得一切交通运输部门和国营工矿企业的职工从中吸取应有的教训。我们的党和人民政府，对于在工矿企业和交通运输等部门中巩固劳动纪律，向来是认真的。对一般犯错误的人，坚持教育方针，并采取群众性的批评和自我批评的方法；但是对于个别严重违犯劳动纪律或屡教不改因而造成重大事故者，则必须视为一种犯罪行为，依据国家的法律严肃加以处理。因为这种因消极怠工和玩忽职守而造成的重大责任事故，虽然和反革命的暗害破坏行为在性质上有所区别，但在客观上同样损害了国家和人民的利益，对国家经济建设事业起了破坏作用。因此，人民司法机关，今后固然要对于制造政治事故的反革命分子严加处理；同时对于重大的责任事故，也要加以严格的注意，并根据情节的轻重，给予犯罪的人适当的惩处。这样做的目的，同样是为了更好地教育广大职工自觉地遵守国家的法令和劳动纪律，使得国家的经济建设事业得以顺利地进行。
    从法院和检察工作方面保障国家经济建设工作的顺利进行，已日益成为各级司法机关的重要任务。在第二届全国司法会议以后，许多地方的人民法院都派出巡回法庭，深入农村和工矿地区受理案件，有些地方并已开始了在工矿企业和交通运输部门中试建专门法院和同志审判会的工作，这在保障正常的生产秩序上起了很大作用。目前全国人民为了完成和超额完成五年建设计划头一年的任务，已普遍开展了增产节约运动。人民法院和检察机关的任务，就是要和一切有碍于增产节约运动顺利进行的行为作斗争。因此，凡是正在试建或已成立专门法院和专门检察署的地区，应在当地党政机关的领导之下，在有关工矿企业和交通运输部门的协助之下，依靠和深入广大职工群众，认真地把这一工作作好；同时还应积累和总结经验，以便不断改进自己的工作，并供其他地区将来开展这一工作时参考和学习。凡是尚未着手试建专门法院和专门检察署的地区，则应有计划地选派干部，有重点地深入工矿地区和交通企业部门进行重点试建，取得经验以便推广。
