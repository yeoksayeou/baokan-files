Leading Farmers to the Road of Common Prosperity

The general line and general task of the Party during the transition period is to gradually promote the collectivization of agriculture and realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. This means gradually organizing the working farmers, carrying out large-scale production based on the public ownership of land and major means of production, using new farm tools and new technologies, and distributing according to the principle of distribution according to work. This is the only correct path to gradually and universally improve agricultural production and the lives of farmers, and to lead all farmers to a happy life. All farmers should warmly support and actively embark on this path.

What is the current state of China's rural economy? On the one hand, since the implementation of land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production and mutual aid and cooperation has been unprecedentedly high. With the state's massive and multi-faceted support, agricultural production has exceeded its historical peak, and farmers' lives have improved year by year. On the other hand, China's small-scale peasant economy still occupies an absolute advantage. Farmers cultivate little land, the scale of cultivation is small, production technology is backward, and life is not yet affluent.

The small-scale peasant economy is unstable. Its economic strength is weak. Once it encounters natural disasters or due to a lack of labor, production often declines. In the past few years of production, the lives of the vast majority of farmers have improved, and some farmers have improved even faster, but there are still some farmers who have fallen into poverty due to natural disasters, illnesses, or other reasons. According to a survey of sixteen villages in ten counties including Huixian, Yanjin, and Jiyuan in Henan Province in June 1952, among all 3,753 households, 185 households sold land, and nearly half of those who lost land did so due to difficulties in life caused by weddings, funerals, illnesses, or disasters.

This proves that the small-scale peasant economy cannot make farmers prosperous. Its management is scattered and its technology is backward, so it cannot unleash the potential of agricultural production. After the land reform, the national average farmer only received a little more than three mu of land, and several crops often had to be planted on this small piece of land. This situation limits the use of new agricultural machinery and makes it difficult to build large-scale farmland water conservancy projects. In the past few years, agricultural production has grown rapidly due to the liberation and land reform which increased the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and because the speed of production recovery was generally faster. However, in the future, if agricultural technology is not improved, expanded production cannot be carried out; if production cannot be expanded, relying solely on existing conditions, even if some output can be increased, it will be very slow. Such small-scale agricultural production cannot only fail to enable all farmers to obtain an affluent life, but also cannot meet the needs of the country and all the people. Taking the grain situation as an example, due to the development of the country's industrial construction, the increase in the population in economic crop areas, and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the people across the country, the demand for grain is also increasing rapidly. The rate of growth in grain demand has exceeded the rate of growth in production. Therefore, if large-scale production is not gradually implemented in agriculture, serious difficulties will inevitably arise in the future. That is, on the one hand, the lives of farmers cannot be improved, and on the other hand, the country's industrial construction cannot proceed smoothly, and the people's lives and market prices cannot be guaranteed to be stable. At the same time, because farmers plant small pieces of land, it is not easy to make plans for production and consumption, and what farmers produce is not easy to be in line with the needs of the country, and what the country produces is not easy to be in line with the needs of farmers. If there is too much, it cannot be sold, and if there is too little, it cannot be bought. This will disrupt the country's plans and affect the normal development of industrial and agricultural production, which is detrimental to both farmers and the country.

So, where is the way out? The way out lies in gradually transforming the small-scale peasant economy into a large-scale agricultural economy, that is, to collectivize the working farmers. In 1929, Stalin, in refuting the argument that the small-scale peasant economy could be transformed into socialism without transformation, pointed out: "Our small-scale peasant economy, for the most part, not only does not realize expanded reproduction year by year, but on the contrary, it is not always possible to even realize simple reproduction. And this small-scale peasant economy, although it cannot realize expanded reproduction, is a force that occupies a large proportion in our national economy. With such a small-scale peasant economy as the agricultural foundation, can we speed up the advancement of our socialist industry? Of course not. Can the Soviet regime and socialist construction be built on two different foundations for a long period of time, on the foundation of the most massive and concentrated socialist industry and the most scattered and backward small commodity peasant economy? Of course not. If this continues for a long time, the entire national economy will be completely disintegrated one day. Where is the way out? The way out lies in making this agriculture a huge agriculture, making it an agriculture that can implement accumulation, can implement expanded reproduction, and thereby transform the agricultural foundation of the national economy." ("Several Questions on Soviet Land Policy") Stalin's words are also applicable to the current situation in China.

Of course, the large-scale production we demand is not any kind of large-scale production without selection. Just as Stalin pointed out in the same speech above, there are two paths to transform the small-scale peasant economy into large-scale agriculture, one is the capitalist path and the other is the socialist path. What is the capitalist road? This is to allow a few farmers to hoard and resell grain, lend money at high interest rates, exploit hired labor, and buy land. As a result, a few people get rich, while the lives of the majority of farmers decline day by day and fall into poverty and bankruptcy. If the rural economy embarks on this road, and a few people control the land, grain, and means of production, they will engage in speculation and profiteering, destroy national construction and the worker-peasant alliance. Not only will the vast majority of farmers suffer, but the urban people will also be exploited and threatened by them.

What is the socialist road? This is to develop mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas, gradually unite small farmers, and use new farm tools and new farming methods to carry out large-scale production. The labor income of farmers, in addition to paying national taxes, the public accumulation fund of the cooperative, and paying for local public welfare expenses, is all owned by the farmers themselves according to the principle of distribution according to work. Whoever works best earns the most, and the widowed and lonely can also receive social care. We oppose taking the capitalist road and advocate taking the socialist road, because only this road can make all farmers prosperous, and only this road can make the interests of farmers consistent with the interests of the country, the interests of industrialization, and the interests of the worker-peasant alliance.

At present, in China's rural areas, the spontaneous forces of capitalism have already developed to some extent. For example, in Gongnong Village in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, because the mutual aid and cooperation movement is relatively backward, the class differentiation in the countryside is relatively large, and the new rich peasants are developing rapidly. They use their economic power to exploit other farmers. The new rich peasant Liu Ziyun also engaged in speculative business, earning four horses in one year in 1949. The new rich peasant Li Fugui organized a fake mutual aid group, using his nine horses and twenty-two hectares of land to "cooperate" with eight poor households without horses, actually engaging in disguised exploitation. The six new rich peasants in the village loaned out half of the total grain loans in the village, with interest rates all above five percent. If this rich peasant economy is allowed to develop, the rural economy will differentiate towards two extremes, with a very small number of farmers becoming rich peasants and the majority of farmers declining into poor and hired peasants. Comparing Gongnong Village with the advanced villages nearby, this change can be clearly seen. The proportion of poor and hired peasants in the advanced villages near Gongnong Village is 37.72 to 15.8; the proportion of middle peasants is 54.58 to 82.7; and the proportion of new rich peasants is 5.58 to 1.42. This is the evil consequence of the unrestricted development of capitalism.

The only correct path for the development of China's small-scale peasant economy is the socialist road. The superiority of socialist agriculture and the prosperous life of socialist farmers can be best seen from the Soviet Union. How do Soviet farmers carry out production? Geng Changsuo, a representative from Hebei of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation, put it very well, saying: "We have been to Ukraine. Collective farms there with 10,000 or 20,000 mu of land are considered small, and it is very common to have 100,000 or 200,000 mu. We saw tractors and combine harvesters doing work that is incomparably more efficient than manual labor. A 'Stalin 80' tractor, with two five-furrow plows, can plow 450 mu of land a day with two or three people, to a depth of nine inches. In our place (Hebei Province), it would take 150 people, 150 cattle, 150 plows, and 30 harrows to plow 450 mu of land a day, and only to a depth of four inches; if you want to plow to a depth of nine inches, you have to double the manpower and animal power. A 'Stalin 80' tractor, with two combine harvesters, can harvest wheat and thresh it on 900 mu of land a day, along with pest control, and the harvester operator, along with the drivers of three transport vehicles, uses a total of 14 people. For the same amount of land, in our place, it would take 360 people to harvest wheat; it would take 120 people and 60 cattle and 60 carts to haul the wheat to the threshing floor; it would take 180 people and 60 cattle to thresh the wheat; and it would take 180 people, 180 cattle, and 180 plows to control pests."

How do Soviet farmers live? Let us still use the talks of the representatives of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to explain. Han En from Jilin Province said: "Mechanization greatly reduces labor, and many women participate in production. It is common for old ladies to get more than 500 labor day wages a year. Good crops grow even on bad land, and foxes are also raised as livestock. Water that used to flow away for nothing can now be used to generate electricity. Collective farmers do not eat from a 'big pot,' but distribute the fruits of their labor according to their work, and those who work more get more, and those who exceed the quota get rewards. Each collective farmer also has his own house garden and a certain number of livestock." Li Shunda from Shanxi Province said: "Collective farmers do not work from dawn to dusk like our farmers. Their labor is not heavy, but their harvests are very large. They have clubs, libraries, nurseries, and kindergartens. Everyone rests on Sundays. Their homes have electric lights and radios, and some have cars and telephones." Wang Hanguo from Guangdong Province said: "There are no poor and hardworking individual farmers in the Soviet Union. Elderly and disabled collective farmers receive help from the mutual aid fund. Patients have hospitals that can provide free treatment. Nurseries and kindergartens are also free. Every child can study for seven years free of charge from the age of seven. Collective farmers in each household... their clothing, food, and household equipment are better than the former landlords in our place."

Today, the vast majority of farmers in our country cannot use machine production, so the production and life of our farmers are still far behind the Soviet farmers. However, in many places, well-run agricultural production cooperatives, although they are only the initial stage of agricultural collectivization (the main means of production are still privately owned, the scale is not large, and the technology is still backward), their grain yields are already higher than those of individual households, and the lives of the cooperative members have also been significantly improved. This also proves the benefits of collectivization. For example, Xigou Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, where Li Shunda is located, was originally a small mountain village with barren land and poor people. Before the Anti-Japanese War, most of the land was concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and rich peasants, and the lives of farmers were very painful. In 1943, farmers organized mutual aid groups under the leadership of Li Shunda, and the rural economy and the lives of farmers began to change. In the winter of 1951, based on Li Shunda's mutual aid group, an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative was formed, and the vast majority of farmers in the village joined the cooperative. Because the collective production force is strong, last year, the 173 mu of autumn-plowed land of Li Shunda's agricultural production cooperative yielded 442 catties per mu, which was 110% higher than the local yield, and won the Central Agricultural Department's award for high yield. Due to the development of production over the years, the lives of farmers in Xigou Village have rapidly improved. In the past three years, 45 new houses and three cave dwellings have been built. As early as 1951, 70% of the households in the village had surplus grain, and the average per capita grain consumption exceeded four times that before the Anti-Japanese War. With the improvement of economic life, cultural life has also improved. An elementary school was established in 1948, two year-round people's schools were established in 1950, and a small library was built in the village. A radio was also installed last August. It can be seen that collective production is the only way for farmers to lead a prosperous life. If the farmers all over the country can be organized into production cooperatives in this way, the amount of agricultural production in our country can be rapidly increased, and the lives of farmers can be further improved. When we move forward to complete socialism, our agricultural production and the lives of farmers will be greatly improved compared to the current agricultural production cooperatives. At that time, the lives of farmers in our country will be as prosperous as the current Soviet farmers.

The future can be seen from the present. Therefore, all farmers across the country should recognize the two roads. For their own prosperous lives and for the interests of the country and the people, they should actively join the mutual aid groups with socialist sprouts, join the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives, so as to further implement the completely socialist production cooperatives (collective farms) and supply and marketing cooperatives with collective peasant public ownership in the future, so that all farmers can become prosperous.

### 领导农民走大家富裕的道路

　　领导农民走大家富裕的道路
    党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，在农业方面是逐步促进农业的合作化，实现农业的社会主义改造。这就是说，要逐步地把劳动农民组织起来，在土地和主要生产工具公有制的基础上，使用新农具和新技术实行大规模生产，并根据按劳分配原则进行分配。这是使农业生产和农民生活逐步地和普遍地提高、使全体农民走向幸福生活的唯一正确的道路。所有的农民，都应当热烈拥护和积极走上这条道路。
    我国农村经济的现状是怎样的呢？一方面，是实行土地改革以后，农民生产的积极性和互助合作的积极性空前高涨；在国家的大量的多方面的扶助之下，农业生产已超过了历史上最高水平，农民生活也一年比一年提高。另一方面，我国小农经济还占绝对优势，农民耕种土地少，耕作规模小，生产技术落后，生活也还不算富裕。
    小农经济是不稳定的，它的经济力量薄弱，一旦遇到自然灾害，或者由于劳动力的缺少，生产常常就会下降。几年的生产过程中，绝大多数农户的生活都上升了，有少数农户上升的更快些，可是也还有一些农户，因为天灾病祸或其他原因而陷于贫困。据河南的辉县、延津、济源等十个县十六个村在一九五二年六月的调查，在全部三七五三户中就有一八五户出卖土地，其中因婚丧病祸生活困难而失去土地者将近一半。
    这就证明小农经济是不能使农民富裕的。它的经营分散，技术落后，是不能发挥农业生产的潜在力的。土地改革以后，全国农民平均每人只分得三亩多地，在这小块土地上，往往还要栽植好几种作物。这种情况就限制了它既不能使用新式的农业机器，也不便于兴修大规模的农田水利。过去几年，由于解放和土地改革使农民的生产积极性增长，并且由于生产恢复的速度一般较快，所以农业生产有了迅速的增长。但在今后，农业技术如不改进，就不能进行扩大生产；不能扩大生产，只靠现有的条件，即使能够增加一些产量，那也是很缓慢的。这样的小农生产不仅不能使全体农民都获得富裕的生活，而且也不能满足国家和全体人民的需要。仍以粮食情况来看，由于国家工业建设的发展，经济作物地区人口增多，全国人民生活逐步改善，粮食需要量也很快增加。粮食需要增长的速度，已经超过了生产增长的速度。因此，如果农业方面不逐步实行大规模的生产，将来就一定会发生严重的困难，这就是一方面农民的生活不能改善，另一方面国家的工业建设不能顺利进行，人民的生活和市场物价不能保证稳定。同时，由于农民一家种一小块土地，在生产和消费方面都不容易订计划，农民生产的东西不容易和国家的需要相合，国家生产的东西也不容易和农民的需要相合，多的卖不掉，少的买不到，这就会破坏国家的计划，也就会影响工农业生产的正常发展，这对农民和国家都是不利的。
    那末，出路在那里呢？出路就在于逐步地使小农经济变成大规模的农业经济，也就是说要使劳动农民集体化。一九二九年，斯大林在驳斥那种认为小农经济不经改造就可以转变为社会主义的论调时曾经指出：“我国小农经济，大部分不仅没有逐年实现扩大的再生产，恰巧相反，它甚至连单纯的再生产，也不是时时都有可能实现的。而这种小农经济虽不能实现扩大再生产，却又是在我国国民经济中占有较大比重的力量。有这样的小农经济为农业基础，难道可以加快速度推进我们社会主义工业么？当然是不可以的。可以在多少长久的时期内，把苏维埃政权和社会主义建设事业建筑在两个不同的基础上，建筑在最巨大集中的社会主义工业基础上和最散漫落后的小商品农民经济基础上么？当然是不可以的。长此以往，整个国民经济都会有完全瓦解的一日。出路何在呢？出路就在于使这个农业成为巨大的农业，使它成为能够实行积累，能够实行扩大再生产的农业，并以此而改造国民经济的农业基础。”（《论苏联土地政策的几个问题》）斯大林的这段话，对于今天我国的情况，也是适用的。
    当然，我们要求的大规模生产，不是不加选择的任何一种大规模的生产。也正如斯大林在以上同一篇演说中所指出的，使小农经济变为大规模的农业，有两条道路可走，一条是资本主义的道路，一条是社会主义的道路。什么是资本主义的道路呢？这就是让少数农民囤粮倒粮，放高利贷，剥削雇工，收买土地，其结果就是少数人发财，而大多数农民生活就日益下降，陷于穷困和破产的境地。农村经济如果走上了这条道路，让少数人掌握了土地、粮食和生产工具，他们就会投机倒把，破坏国家建设和工农联盟，不仅广大农民要吃亏，就是城市人民也要受他们的剥削和威胁。
    什么是社会主义的道路呢？这就是在农村中发展互助合作，使小农户逐步地联合起来，用新的农具和新的耕作法进行大规模的生产。农民劳动所得，除缴纳国税、合作社的公积金和支付当地公共福利的开支外，根据按劳分配的原则，都分归农民自己所有。谁劳动得最好，谁的收入就最多，而且鳏寡孤独也能得到社会的照顾。我们反对走资本主义的道路而主张走社会主义的道路，因为只有这条道路才能使全体农民都富裕起来，才能使农民的利益同国家的利益、工业化的利益、工农联盟的利益相一致。
    目前在我国农村中，资本主义的自发势力已经有了某些发展。例如黑龙江省克山县的工农村，由于互助合作运动比较落后，农村阶级分化较大，新富农发展较快，他们就利用自己的经济力量，对其他农民进行剥削。新富农刘子云兼营投机生意，一九四九年一年内就赚了四匹马。新富农李富贵组织假互助组，以自己的九匹马和二十二垧地，和八户无马的贫困户“合作”，实际上进行着变相的剥削。该村六户新富农，放出的贷粮占全村贷粮总数的一半，利息都在五分以上。这种富农经济如果听其发展，农村经济就会向着两个极端分化，极少数的农民变成富农，多数农民下降成了贫雇农。用工农村和它附近的先进村庄比较，可以很清楚的看出这种变化。工农村和它附近的先进村庄的贫雇农，在全体农户中所占的比例为三十七点七二比十五点八；中农为五十四点五八比八十二点七；新富农为五点五八比一点四二。这就是资本主义发展没有受到限制的恶果。
    我国小农经济发展的唯一正确的道路，就是社会主义的道路。社会主义农业的优越性和社会主义农民的富裕生活，从苏联可以看到最好的榜样。苏联农民是怎样进行生产的呢？中国农民代表参观团的河北代表耿长锁说得很好，他说：“我们到过乌克兰，那里集体农场有土地一两万亩的算小的，有一、二十万亩的很平常。我们看到了拖拉机和联合收割机做着比人工效率高得不可比拟的工作。一辆‘斯大林八十号’拖拉机，带两个五铧犁，用两三个人一天耕四百五十亩地，深达九寸。在我们那里（河北省），要用一百五十个人、一百五十头牛、一百五十付犁、三十付耙，一天才能耕四百五十亩地，而且只能耕四寸深；如果要耕九寸深，还要加一倍的人力和畜力。一辆‘斯大林八十号’拖拉机，带两辆联合收割机，一天能在九百亩的土地上收麦打麦，附带灭?，收割机手连三辆运输汽车司机等共用十四人。同样多的地，在我们那里，割麦时得用三百六十个人；把麦拉到打谷场得用一百二十个人和六十头牛、六十辆车；打麦得用一百八十个人、六十头牛；灭?得用一百八十个人、一百八十头牛和一百八十付犁。”
    苏联农民又是怎样生活的呢？让我们仍然引用中国农民代表参观团的代表们的谈话来作说明。吉林省的韩恩说：“机械化使劳动大大减轻，妇女参加生产的很多，老太太一年得五百多个劳动日报酬的是常事。歹地也长出好庄稼，狐狸也养成家畜，以前白白流走的水现在也可用来发电。集体农民并不吃什么大锅饭，而是按劳动分果实，多劳多得，超额的给奖励。每户集体农民还有自己的宅旁园圃和一定数目的家畜。”山西省的李顺达说：“集体农民不像我们农民那样从天亮劳动到天黑。他们劳动不繁重，收获却很多。他们有俱乐部、图书馆、托儿所、幼儿园。星期天大家休息。他们家里有电灯、收音机，有些有汽车、电话。”广东省的汪汉国说：“苏联没有贫苦的工作繁重的个体农民。年老和残废的集体农民从互助基金得到帮助。病人有医院可以免费治疗。托儿所和幼儿园也是免费的。每个儿童从七岁起可以免费念七年书。各户集体农民……他们穿的、吃的和家庭的设备，赛过我们那里过去的财主。”
    今天我国广大农民还不能使用机器生产，因此我国农民的生产和生活，跟苏联农民比较，还相差很远。但许多地方办得好的农业生产合作社，虽然还只是农业集体化的初步（主要生产资料还是私有的，规模还不大，技术也还落后），他们的粮食已经比单干户产得多，社员的生活也已经有显著的改善。这也就证明了集体化的好处。例如李顺达所在的山西省平顺县的西沟村，原是一个地瘠民贫的小山庄。抗战以前，土地大部集中在少数地主富农手中，农民生活十分痛苦。一九四三年，农民在李顺达领导下组织了互助组，农村经济和农民生活开始改变。一九五一年冬季，以李顺达互助组为基础，组成了一个农林畜牧生产合作社，全村绝大多数农户都参加了这个合作社。由于集体生产力量大，去年李顺达农业生产合作社的一七三亩秋耕地，每亩产量四四二斤，较当地产量高出百分之一百一十，获得了中央农业部的丰产奖励。由于历年生产的发展，西沟村农民的生活迅速获得了改善。三年来，新建房屋四十五间，窑三孔。还在一九五一年，全村就已有百分之七十的农户有余粮，每人平均吃粮超过抗战以前四倍。随着经济生活的改善，文化生活也提高了。一九四八年建立了一所小学，一九五○年成立了两所常年民校，并在村内建立了一座小型图书馆，去年八月还安装了一架收音机。由此可见，集体生产乃是农民走向富裕生活的唯一道路。如果全国的农民都能这样地组织成为生产合作社，我国的农业生产量就可以迅速地提高，农民的生活也就可以进一步得到改善。再往前进到完全社会主义的时候，我们的农业生产和农民的生活，就比目前的农业生产合作社还要大大地提高。那时，我国农民的生活就将和现在的苏联农民一样的富裕了。
    从眼前可以看到将来。因此，全国农民弟兄都应该认清两条道路，为了自己的富裕生活，为了国家和全国人民的利益，积极加入带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组，加入半社会主义的农业生产合作社和供销合作社，以便将来进一步实行集体农民公有制的完全社会主义的生产合作社（集体农庄）和供销合作社，使全体农民都富裕起来。
