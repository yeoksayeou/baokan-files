(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 7th) American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war held in the northern section of the Demilitarized Zone have filed a protest with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) on the 6th, objecting to the U.S. military headquarters sending them a large number of newspapers, magazines, telegrams and letters to "coerce and influence" them, considering this to be an "illegal and despicable" action. They charged that the newspapers and magazines contained intimidating articles, while the letters and telegrams were sent by "people who have nothing to do with them."

At a press conference held on the evening of the 6th, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, General Thimayya, said that the prisoners of war had written three letters last month requesting a conversation with the Commission, presumably to discuss this issue, but their requests were ignored. Therefore, the prisoners of war had to request two Indian Custodial Forces officers to be with them at noon today. Thimayya said that they did this "to bring this situation to the attention of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and to lodge their protest." He said that the two officers returned shortly afterwards, and they were "well taken care of" and "not physically abused." The prisoners of war had lunch with them and invited them to play bridge.

In the protest letter from twenty-one American prisoners of war, one British prisoner of war, and three hundred and thirty-two South Korean prisoners of war, specific examples were cited of coercion in the newspapers and magazines sent by the U.S. military headquarters. They presented to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a copy of the "Englewood Daily News" from New Jersey, USA, dated September 24, 1953, which contained an article with an intimidating headline: "A military spokesman said that prisoners of war who have changed their beliefs may be classified as deserters." The prisoners of war also presented the Commission with a copy of "Reader's Digest" – an American magazine – which contained four articles of a similar nature.

The prisoners of war accused the U.S. military headquarters of sending them a large bundle of letters and telegrams, mainly collected from the North Carolina and Chicago areas of the United States, which contained old-fashioned and intimidating content. The protest letter said that the American authorities "even used elementary school students to write old-fashioned letters in their psychological warfare against prisoners of war."

The prisoners of war demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission immediately stop the U.S. military headquarters from continuing to intimidate them in this way. General Thimayya said that he would prohibit the delivery of all mail, newspapers and magazines to the camp, and that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission would consider the issue on the 7th.

Until now, the U.S. authorities have not started explanations to the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in the northern camp. They are concentrating all their efforts on disrupting the explanation work being carried out on the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the southern camp.

    不直接遣返的三百五十四名美、英、南朝鲜籍战俘
    抗议美方对他们进行恫吓性的文字宣传
    【新华社开城七日电】在非军事区北半部看管营房中的美、英战俘和南朝鲜战俘，在六日向中立国遣返委员会提出抗议，反对美军司令部寄给他们大量报纸、杂志、电报和信件以“胁迫和影响”他们，认为这是一种“非法的和卑鄙的”行动。他们指责说，报纸和杂志中有着恫吓性的文章，而信件和电报则是一些“与他们没有关系的人”发来的。
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在六日晚上举行的一个记者招待会上说，战俘们上个月曾写了三次信要求和委员会谈一次话，大概是谈一谈这个问题，但是他们的要求被忽视了。因此战俘们不得不要求两名印度看管部队军官在今天中午与他们在一起。蒂迈雅说，他们这样做是“为了使中立国遣返委员会注意这种情况，并提出他们的抗议”。他说，这两名军官不久以后就回来了，他们受到了“很好的照顾”，“未曾受到肉体上的粗暴对待”。战俘们与他们一起吃午饭，并邀他们打桥牌。
    在二十一个美国战俘、一个英国战俘和三百三十二个南朝鲜战俘的抗议书中，引述了美军司令部寄去的报纸、杂志中有显然是向他们进行胁迫的具体例子。他们向中立国遣返委员会提出一份一九五三年九月二十四日美国新泽西州“茵格伍德日报”，其中有一篇文章带着恫吓性的导语：“一个军方发言人说，改变了信仰的战俘可能被列为逃兵。”战俘们又向委员会提出了一册“读者文摘”——一种美国杂志——其中有四篇类似性质的文章。
    战俘们指责美军司令部寄给他们一大捆信件和电报，主要是从美国的北卡罗来纳州和芝加哥地区搜集来的，这些信件和电报有着老一套的和恫吓性的内容。抗议书说，美国当局“在他们对战俘进行心理战中，甚至利用小学生写老一套的信件”。
    战俘们要求中立国遣返委员会立即制止美军司令部继续用这种方式来恫吓他们。蒂迈雅将军说，他将禁止把一切邮件、报纸和杂志送到营房里去，同时中立国遣返委员会将在七日考虑这个问题。
    直到现在，美国当局还未开始向北部营场中的不直接遣返的战俘进行解释。他们集中全力来破坏对南部营场的朝中战俘进行的解释工作。
