    We Are Fully Supporting the Seamless Steel Tube Plant
    Yu Ruiying, Deputy Director of Production, Angang General Machinery Plant

    The people of the whole country are concerned about the seamless steel tube plant and look forward to its early operation. All the workers of our factory not only eagerly anticipate its completion but also support its construction with our own labor and wisdom.

    We have transferred the best technicians and skilled workers to support the seamless steel tube plant. Although our factory's technical personnel only account for 2.15% of the total number of workers, and many good skilled workers have been transferred to study or become cadres, when we think of the importance of the seamless steel tube plant in the national industrialization construction and that supporting the construction of the seamless steel tube plant means supporting the national construction, we still drew four of the best technical personnel, twenty-six first and second-grade veteran skilled workers, and eight workshop directors and section chiefs to the seamless steel tube plant.

    "Ensure the quality of all kinds of spare parts." This is the goal of all workers in manufacturing parts for the seamless steel tube plant. When we started producing needle tubes, chrome steel parts, and circuit breakers, most of them were defective. Some people lost confidence, thinking, "How can our technical level reach socialist standards?" However, with the enthusiasm to support the seamless steel tube plant, no matter how difficult it is, we are determined to overcome it. Everyone used their brains to find solutions. Liu Shuwen, a core-making worker, improved the composition of the sand and mixed it with oil, making the cores stronger. Technician Shi Zepu and the workers studied together and improved the gate. Because of their creation and improvement, the quality of the needle tubes increased from 10% to 85%. The output also increased by more than two times. When manufacturing circuit breakers, in order to ensure quality, the fitter team initially did not know how to make them, so they went to the repair shop to learn from experience. After worker Wang Zhongren learned it, he proposed the use of grinding and scraping methods, creating a grinding tool tire, using lubricating oil, cement, and glass powder for grinding. Workers Li Xuecai, Wang Shengxiang, Li Wenlin, and others put forward more than ten rationalization proposals in the process of making circuit breakers and improved four tools. The fitter team also established a "Circuit Breaker Youth Contracting Team." Everyone worked like "hungry tigers preying" to support the seamless steel tube plant. They came early in the morning and did not leave the factory until around ten o'clock in the evening. The workers were afraid of delaying the start date of the seamless steel tube plant, and some even moved into the factory to live there. According to the current factory equipment situation, it is very difficult to manufacture tools for the seamless steel tube plant. In order to complete this task, many technical and equipment problems must be solved. We installed a half-ton electric furnace, and this electric furnace was put into production only after Comrade Klinkov, a Soviet expert, personally operated and helped; we established a "Seamless Steel Tube Plant Tool Manufacturing Team" to specifically guide the work of manufacturing tools. In order to ensure and strive for the early start of the seamless steel tube plant, it was proposed to complete the task in seven days. From wooden molds to processing, a series of processes would take at least more than a month. The workers used all their strength to ensure the completion of this task. Veteran worker Ji Qingji took the drawings and worked overnight after dinner. Others asked him, "Why are you so busy?" He said, "It doesn't matter if I stay less time, the start of the seamless steel tube plant is important!" The workers who made the mold and poured saw that the workers in the previous processes had completed their tasks ahead of schedule, and their confidence and energy were even greater. They did not rest on Sunday, and under the leadership of Section Chief Qian Jiagui and veteran worker Liu Huichun, five people worked until 6:30 in the evening to complete the mold-making task. In this way, the task was completed in five days. At the same time, the quality of the new products was also guaranteed. The whole factory successfully completed two hundred and five manufacturing tasks.

    我们用全力支援无缝钢管厂
    鞍钢机械总厂生产副厂长   于瑞英
    全国人民关心着无缝钢管厂，盼望着它早日开工。我们全厂职工，不仅也热烈地盼望它的建成，更以本身的劳动和智慧来支援它的建设。
    我们抽调了最好的技工、技术员去支援无缝钢管厂；虽然，我们厂的技术人员只占工人总数的百分之二点一五；还有不少好的技工调去学习，或者当了干部，但当我们一想到：无缝钢管厂在全国工业化建设中的重要性，想到：支援无缝钢管厂的建设就是支援全国建设的时候，我们仍然抽出四名最好的技术人员，二十六名一、二级老技工和八名车间主任、科长给无缝钢管厂。
    “保证各种备品的质量。”这是全体工人们给无缝钢管厂制造配件的目标。当我们开始生产针状管、铭钢件、开闭器时，大部分都是废品。有的人失掉信心，认为：“我们的技术水平，哪能达到社会主义的标准呢？”但我们在支援无缝钢管厂的热情下，不管有多大困难，都有决心来克服它。大家开动脑筋想办法。做芯子工人刘书文改进了砂子成份、用油拌砂，造出来的芯子坚固了。技术员施泽普和工人一起研究改进了浇口。因为他们的创造和改进，针状管的质量由百分之十，提高到百分之八十五。产量也提高两倍多。在制造开闭器时，为了保证质量，钳工班开始不知道用什么办法能做成，他们就到修配厂去学习经验。工人王忠人学回来以后，提出了用研刮办法，创造出研磨工具胎，利用润滑油、水泥、玻璃粉研磨。工人李学才、王胜祥、李文林等在做开闭器中，提出合理化建议十余件，改进工具四件。钳工班还成立了“开闭器青年包打小组”。大家为支援无缝钢管厂真像“饿虎捕食”一样地工作着。早晨早来，晚上十点左右才离开工厂，工人们怕误了无缝钢管厂开工日期，有的甚至搬到工厂住宿。按目前工厂设备情况，要给无缝钢管厂制造工具是很困难的。为了完成这个任务，必须解决技术和设备上的许多问题。我们安装了半吨电炉，经苏联专家克林考夫同志亲自操作帮助这台电炉才进行了生产；我们成立了“无缝钢管厂工具制造组”，专门指导制造工具的工作。为了保证和争取无缝钢管厂提前开工，提出要在七天完成任务。从木型到加工一系列的工序，起码也要一个多月才行。工人们以全付力量来保证这个任务的完成，老工人吉庆吉吃完晚饭接过图纸连夜干。别人问他：“为什么这样忙呢？”他说：“我少呆一会不要紧，无缝钢管厂开工要紧啊！”做合型和浇注的工人看到前边工序的工人都提前完成了任务，他们信心和劲头就更大了，星期天也没有休息，在段长钱家贵和老工人刘惠春的带动下，五个人一直干到晚六点半钟完成了合型任务。就这样，在五天的时间完成了任务。同时还保证了新产品的质量。全厂胜利地完成了二百零五件制造任务。
