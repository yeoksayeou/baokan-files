    The Ugly Face of American "Psychological Warfare" Conspirators
    Li Gao
    Before Hitler was buried in his Berlin bunker, he frantically clamored for so-called "nerve warfare." Now, American generals and politicians have inherited Hitler's mantle and are shouting about "psychological warfare" everywhere. The "Wall Street Journal" recently revealed that the U.S. government plans to use "psychological warfare" to maintain tension and "prevent" domestic economic crises. In Korea, they even use prisoners of war as cannon fodder for "psychological warfare," forcibly coercing the retention of North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Although they failed on the battlefield, they believe that if they can forcibly retain a group of prisoners of war, they will have "won" in "psychological warfare."
    In order to carry out this heinous "psychological warfare," American executioners conducted unprecedented bloody "screenings" in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps to force North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to express their "unwillingness to be repatriated." The hundreds of bloody massacres and various horrific tortures in prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, Koje Island, and other places are already well known to the world. To remind people of their memories, here is a bloody record from an American reporter describing the massacre launched by the U.S. military on June 10, 1952, before the "screening" in prisoner-of-war camp No. 76 on Geoje Island: "United Nations troops, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, rushed into this camp, firing about 1,000 flamethrowers, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades. American soldiers on tanks and on foot opened fire on the large groups of Chinese communist prisoners of war who were shouting loudly." (Associated Press) "Some Chinese communist prisoners hid in wooden houses. Paratroopers used axes to cut holes in the houses and threw tear gas and concussion grenades inside. ... The wooden buildings were blown over. The prisoners hugged each other. Determined American paratroopers threw concussion grenades into the densely packed groups of prisoners. American bayonets flashed, ... they used bayonets to kill resisting prisoners. ... The ground was covered with moaning wounded. The battlefield was full of corpses. ... Blood flowed in rivers in the three-and-a-half-foot-deep trenches." (United Press)
    The American invading army, which was beaten so badly on the battlefield that they "lowered their heads," slaughtered unarmed prisoners of war until "blood flowed in rivers," in order to make people believe the outrageous lie that the prisoners of war were "unwilling to be repatriated." At this time, the so-called "psychological warfare" propagandists in the United States, in order to "win" this "psychological warfare," naturally wouldn't say a word; it is quite natural that the Swiss "humanitarians" also stood by silently.
    In order to carry out this heinous "psychological warfare," American conspirators also openly brought the most vile things in the "American way of life" – secret agent terror – to the prisoner-of-war camps to "exhibit" to the whole world. When the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were still in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island and other places, the Associated Press had already admitted that the "torture and assassination by U.S. secret agents are intertwined into a terrifying picture in the daily lives of the prisoners here." Now, this kind of torture and assassination by U.S. secret agents has been carried out even more rampantly in the prisoner-of-war camp in Dongchang-ri. Listen to the accusation of witness Zhang Yongbin when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission investigated the murder case of prisoner of war Zhang Zilong: "When the secret agents found out that Zhang Zilong was going to return to his country, they first hung him on a tent pole and beat him severely all night. The next day, they cut off pieces of flesh from his body, and then cut off his ears and fingers, peeled off his scalp, and cut off his buttocks. When he was tortured until he was bloody and only had a sliver of breath left, the secret agents poured kerosene on him and burned him, and finally cut open his stomach and dug out his heart and liver...." This American-style beastly behavior committed by the secret agents trained and commanded by the United States has now been fully exposed to the people of the world. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly confirmed the barbaric crimes of U.S. secret agents in prisoner-of-war camps. However, the U.S. "psychological warfare" propaganda machine and the Swiss representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission seem to want people to believe that there is "no" secret agent control in the prisoner-of-war camps, but only prisoners of war who "freely" choose "unwillingness to be repatriated." When people demanded the removal of the secret agents who murdered prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps, the American executioners and Swiss representatives suddenly became "humanitarians." They shouted that force must not be used to sanction the murderous secret agents "under any circumstances." Look at it people: this is the bloody face of the American "psychological warfare" propagandists!
    American "psychological warfare" manufacturers not only harmed countless innocent prisoners of war, but also ridiculed the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at the expense of America's "international credibility." U.S. "United Nations Command" Commander Clark personally signed an agreement to invite five neutral nations to Korea to establish the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but from the day the neutral nations representatives arrived in Korea, U.S. "psychological warfare" experts used various means of intimidation, insult, slander, and oppression against them. In order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, American conspirators either instructed its dog, Syngman Rhee, to clamor to "drive the neutral nations out of Korea," or demanded that the neutral nations "stand on the side of the United States." Every provision of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and every task arranged by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been completely destroyed by the U.S. side and U.S. secret agents. The U.S. "psychological warfare" propaganda machine even tirelessly used the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to create rumors. The "Indian Times" reported on November 15th about Lieutenant General Thimayya's "experience in dealing with United Nations reporters," saying: "The Indian liaison office had to refute almost every American news agency's report about his (referring to Lieutenant General Thimayya) talk at the press conference and issue 'official records.' The problem of misreporting has become so serious that General Thimayya had to cancel meeting reporters altogether." However, the shameless U.S. "psychological warfare" propaganda machine turned around and provoked the relationship between India and the North Korean and Chinese sides.
    The facts have already shown the hideous faces of the American executioners to the people of the world like a "demon-revealing mirror." But the American propaganda machine, like a jackal boasting of the blood on its mouth, shamelessly calculates the percentage of prisoners of war they have detained every day, saying that this is "very likely to be our (America's) greatest victory in the Korean War" (according to a senior U.S. State Department official).
    But have the American "psychological warfare" conspirators "achieved" any "victory"? The answer of the facts is no. The bloody "screening" carried out by the United States on Geoje Island caused it to suffer complete political and moral failure, arousing the angry condemnation of righteous people around the world, and putting itself in a more isolated position. Even the British bourgeois newspaper "Reynolds News" said at the time: "America's claims and America's screening methods" are "stinking." The vast people of the world, of course, have a clearer understanding of the United States' barbaric act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. This forced Dulles, the spokesperson of the American reactionary group, to admit: "Most people in the world today believe that we (America) have committed heinous atrocities" (Associated Press, September 17, 1952); "Looking at American history, America has never been as unpopular abroad as it is now" (Dulles's speech at the annual meeting of the American "National Editorial Association" in June 1952).
    But the incorrigibly evil American executioners are still directing the Rhee-Chiang secret agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp to continue to commit heinous atrocities. The United States, disregarding everything, is carrying out this so-called "psychological warfare," which has long gone bankrupt, obviously attempting to undermine the Korean armistice and create tension so that American monopoly capital can seize more high profits. The "Indian Times" said in its October 5th editorial: In the entire issue of the Korean repatriation of prisoners of war, the United States "seems more interested in hindering the resolution of the repatriation issue. It is quite appropriate to ask the United States: does it want peace or does it want war?" All peace-loving people around the world should rise up and fight to resolutely stop and completely crush this vicious conspiracy of American "psychological warfare."

    美国“心理战”阴谋家的嘴脸
    李高
    希特勒在葬身柏林的地窖之前，曾疯狂地叫嚣过所谓“神经战”。现在，美国的将军、政客们继承了希特勒的衣钵，到处喊叫什么“心理战”。“华尔街日报”最近透露说，美国政府计划用“心理战”来保持紧张局势，“防止”国内的经济危机。在朝鲜，他们甚至把战俘作为“心理战”的炮灰，硬要强迫扣留朝中被俘人员。在战场虽然失败了，据说他们如果能够把战俘强迫扣留下来一批，在“心理战”中却是“胜利”的。
    为了进行这个罪恶的“心理战”，美国刽子手们在美方战俘营中进行了史无前例的血腥“甄别”，以强迫朝中战俘表示“不愿遣返”。巨济岛、蜂岩岛等处战俘营中的千百次血腥屠杀和各种惨不忍闻的酷刑拷打，这已是举世皆知的事情了。为了提醒一下人们的记忆，这里有美国记者描写一九五二年六月十日美军在巨济岛第七十六号战俘营进行“甄别”前发动大屠杀的血腥记录为证：“联合国军队在坦克和装甲车掩护下冲进这个营场，发射了约一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹。坦克上的和步行的美国士兵向大声喊叫的大群共军战俘开火。”（合众社）“有些共俘躲在木房子里。伞兵用斧头在房子上砍出一些洞来，向里面投催泪瓦斯与震荡手榴弹。……木料建筑物被炸翻了。俘虏们彼此抱着。坚决的美国伞兵就往挤得密密的俘虏群中扔震荡手榴弹。美国刺刀闪着光，……他们用刺刀杀抵抗的俘虏。……地上躺满了呻吟的负伤者。战场上遍是死尸。……血在三呎半深的壕沟中流成河。”（美联社）
    在战场上被打得“低下头来”的美国侵略军，把手无寸铁的战俘杀得“血流成河”，为的是要人们相信战俘“不愿遣返”的弥天大谎。这时候，美国的所谓“心理战”宣传家们为了“赢得”这场
  “心理战”，当然是不会吱声的；瑞士的“人道主义者”们也站在一旁一声不响，这是很自然的。
    为了进行这个罪恶的“心理战”，美国阴谋家们还把“美国生活方式”中最恶浊的东西——特务恐怖——公然搬到战俘营中来“展览”给全世界看。朝中战俘还在巨济岛等处的美方战俘营的时候，合众社就已承认：美方特务的“酷刑暗杀在这里的俘虏的日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。现在，美方特务的这种酷刑暗杀在东场里的战俘营中更为变本加厉地进行了。请听一听中立国遣返委员会调查战俘张子龙被杀案件时证人张永斌的控诉：“特务们发现张子龙要回国时，先把他吊在帐篷杆子上毒打了一夜。第二天，就一块一块地割下他身上的肉，然后又割下他的耳朵、手指，剥掉头皮，割掉屁股。当他被折磨得血肉模糊、只剩一丝气息的时候，特务又用火油烧他，最后才剖开肚子，挖出心肝……。”美国训练和指挥的特务们所干的这种美国式的禽兽行为，现在已经在全世界人民面前暴露无余了。中立国遣返委员会曾屡次证实美方特务在战俘营中的野蛮罪行。但是，美国的“心理战”宣传机器和中立国遣返委员会的瑞士代表却似乎要人们相信，战俘营中“根本没有”特务控制，而只有“自由地”选择“不愿遣返”的战俘。当人们要求清除战俘营中残杀战俘的特务的时候，美国刽子手和瑞士代表却忽然变成“人道主义者”了。他们大喊大叫“在任何情况下”不得使用武力制裁杀人的特务。人们看看吧：这就是美国“心理战”宣传者的血腥嘴脸！
    美国“心理战”制造者不仅残害了无数无辜战俘，而且不惜拿美国的“国际信誉”做赌本来嘲弄中立国遣返委员会。美国的“联合国军”总司令克拉克曾亲自签字同意邀请五个中立国来到朝鲜成立中立国遣返委员会，可是从中立国代表到达朝鲜的一天起，美国“心理战”的专家们就对他们施用了各种恫吓、侮辱、诬蔑和压迫的手段。为了达到强迫扣留战俘的目的，美国阴谋家们不是指使它的走狗李承晚叫嚷要把中立国“从朝鲜赶出去”，就是要中立国“站到美国这一边”。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的每一项规定和中立国遣返委员会安排的每一项工作，都已被美方和美方特务破坏无余。美国“心理战”宣传机器甚至不停息地利用中立国遣返委员会主席来制造谣言。“印度时报”在十一月十五日报道蒂迈雅中将“跟联合国记者相处的经验”说：“印度方面的联络处不得不反驳几乎每个美国通讯社关于他（指蒂迈雅中将）在记者招待会的谈话的报道，并发布‘正式记录’。错误报道这个问题已经弄得很严重了，以致蒂迈雅将军只好根本取消会见记者。”可是，无耻的美国“心理战”宣传机器却反过来挑拨印度和朝中方面的关系。
    事实已经像“照妖镜”似地把美国刽子手的狰狞脸孔显示在世界人民之前了。而美国宣传机器却像豺狼夸耀自己嘴上的血迹一样，每天无耻地计算着他们扣留战俘的百分比，据说这“很可能就是我们（美国）在朝鲜战争中取得的最大胜利”（美国国务院高级官员语）。
    但是，美国“心理战”阴谋家们是不是“取得”了什么“胜利”呢？事实的回答是否定的。美国在巨济岛上干的血腥的“甄别”，使它在政治上和道义上遭到了完全的失败，引起了全世界正义人士的愤怒谴责，使它自己陷于更加孤立的地位。甚至英国的资产阶级报纸“雷诺新闻”在当时就说：
  “美国的说法和美国的甄别方法”是“臭气薰天”的。世界广大人民对美国强迫扣留战俘的野蛮行为，当然认识得更为清楚。这使得美国反动集团的代言人杜勒斯也不得不承认：“世界上大部地区的人今天都认为我们（美国）干了大恶不赦的暴行”（美联社一九五二年九月十七日电）；“打开美国历史看，美国在国外从来没有像现在这样不得人心”
  （杜勒斯一九五二年六月在美国“全国主笔协会”年会上的演说）。
    可是怙恶不悛的美国刽子手们，直到现在还在指使东场里战俘营内的李蒋特务继续干着大恶不赦的暴行。美国不顾一切地进行这种早已破产了的所谓“心理战”，显然是企图破坏朝鲜停战，制造紧张局势，以便美国垄断资本攫取更多的高额利润。“印度时报”在十月五日的社论中说：在整个朝鲜遣返战俘问题上，美国“对阻碍解决遣返问题似乎更感兴趣。很可以问问美国：它究竟是要和平呢还是要战争？”全世界和平人民都应该起来，为坚决制止和彻底粉碎美国这种“心理战”的恶毒阴谋而斗争。
