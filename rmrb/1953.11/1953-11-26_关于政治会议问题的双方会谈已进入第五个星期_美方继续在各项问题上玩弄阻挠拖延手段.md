Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 23rd: Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Bilateral talks on the political conference issue have entered their fifth week, but the U.S. side continues to employ obstructive and delaying tactics on various issues. U.S. representative Dean, inheriting the destructive skills of Joy and Harrison, is attempting to turn the bilateral talks on the political conference issue into yet another protracted Panmunjom truce negotiation.

Dean has made no secret of calling his delaying tactics "long-term bargaining." Dean's "bargaining" strategy has resulted in the discussion of the agenda issue alone lasting for three weeks. Only after Dean's every excuse for refusing to discuss the membership issue was refuted and overturned did he reluctantly stop pretending that he was "unauthorized" to discuss the issue and agree to include the membership issue as the first item on the agenda. There is every reason to hope that this is an indication that Dean is willing to honestly discuss the issue, rather than a trick merely used to deceive world public opinion.

However, the discussions on membership, location, and time over the past six days have proven that Dean is still unwilling to honestly discuss and resolve the issue, but is merely attempting to continue to delay the time with various trivial questions, continuing to peddle his trick of refusing neutral countries to participate in the political conference.

At the subcommittee meeting on membership and location on the 17th, the Korean and Chinese side put forward a completely reasonable proposal on the membership issue. This proposal advocated that the political conference take the form of a bilateral and equal meeting; all decisions of the meeting must obtain the unanimous consent of both parties; the conference should be jointly invited by both parties for the participation of five relevant neutral countries, including the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, to ensure the smooth progress of the conference. The rationality of this proposal is so obvious that even Britain, which participated in the Korean War with the United States, believes that the Korean and Chinese side's proposal is "a noteworthy proposal" and should be "carefully considered."

But Dean still attempted to negate the membership issue.

Both of his "suggestions" were actually a repetition of the old tune of opposing the participation of neutral countries in the political conference. His first "suggestion" was that the U.S. side was only prepared to "consider adding participants to the political conference" after "the political conference itself has reached a completely satisfactory agreement on the Korean issue." His second "suggestion" was that only after the political conference was convened, "and after it has spent a reasonable amount of time on substantive issues," when the U.S. side believes that "if the development process of the political conference seems to be appropriate for other participants," the U.S. side is prepared to suggest to all other participants in the political conference on the U.S. side to "consider this issue" "within the appropriate time" and "within the above-mentioned restrictions."

Obviously, the first suggestion here is not to allow neutral countries to participate in the political conference at all. The second suggestion is the U.S. side's propaganda of asking neutral countries to act as "reporters." This, of course, is also not to allow neutral countries to participate in the meeting. The U.S. side knows that the Korean and Chinese side firmly advocates that the political conference should have the participation of neutral countries, but they insist on repeating these suggestions every day to oppose neutral countries. Isn't this deliberate sabotage?

Dean refused to honestly discuss the very clear and understandable proposal of the Korean and Chinese side at the subcommittee meeting, but only repeatedly raised one question after another that had already been answered, and slandered the neutral countries, comparing them to the Kuomintang bandit gang. He attempted to unilaterally interpret the Korean and Chinese side's proposal based on the U.S. side's negative attitude towards the membership issue, thereby achieving the purpose of essentially canceling the role of neutral countries. Before the meeting on the 23rd, Dean again threatened through the American propaganda machine that if the Korean and Chinese side did not give him a satisfactory answer to these "questions" within two or three days, he would "write off" the Korean and Chinese side's proposal. At the meeting on the 23rd, his slander of neutral countries reached a new peak. He said that neutral countries might "prolong the discussion," "bring about the deadlock that you fear" (obviously, the U.S. side likes the deadlock and often deliberately creates it to obstruct the convening of the political conference), "make the political conference encounter real difficulties and setbacks," and "hinder the reaching of resolutions by both parties." According to him, it seems that neutral countries are going to obstruct and sabotage the political conference. All this nonsense fully proves that Dean does not want to seriously consider the proposal of the Korean and Chinese side. His one "question" after another is just a trick to confuse world public opinion.

Regarding the location of the political conference, Dean also adopted a non-serious and childish attitude. He even suggested that South America and Franco's Spain's Madrid be the location of the conference. Even the United Press said that these cities proposed by Dean were not serious. Dean was obviously attempting to complicate the discussion with this kind of unrealistic so-called "suggestion" in order to continue to delay the time.

On the issue of the timing of the meeting, Dean stated in his speech on the 16th that the political conference would be held on December 15th. When the Korean and Chinese side suggested on the 17th that the meeting be held in December and not fix a specific date, the U.S. side pretended and insisted on immediately determining a specific date in mid-December. However, with the development of the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the U.S. side no longer wanted a specific date. They first opposed the Korean and Chinese side's later proposal to convene the political conference four weeks after the first item on the agenda was agreed upon, and then put forward a "new suggestion" that the political conference should be convened no later than forty-two days after all items on the agenda were fully agreed upon, and this also assumed that the items on the agenda would be agreed upon no later than December 1st, otherwise the time for the convening of the political conference would not be determined at all. The U.S. side's erratic approach to the timing of the meeting is obviously an attempt to postpone the political conference indefinitely, or at least postpone it until the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over the prisoners of war for ninety or even one hundred and twenty days, in order to further conspire on the prisoner of war issue.

The attitude of the U.S. side in the past week further proves that the U.S. side lacks sincerity in the political conference. U.S. Acting Deputy Secretary of State Murphy claimed last week that if the political conference could not be held, it would be "entirely attributable to" the Korean and Chinese side. The U.S. State Department is now obviously interested not in the issue of holding a political conference, but in how to make the political conference impossible to hold and shirk responsibility for itself. This attempt has been fully demonstrated in Dean's delaying tactics. The Korean and Chinese side has warned Dean that if the U.S. side does not want to continue the talks, it should make it clear and bear all the responsibility for destroying the talks.

### 关于政治会议问题的双方会谈已进入第五个星期  美方继续在各项问题上玩弄阻挠拖延手段

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈已进入第五个星期
    美方继续在各项问题上玩弄阻挠拖延手段
      【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：关于政治会议问题的双方会谈已经进入了第五个星期，但是美方在各项问题上仍然采取阻挠拖延的手段。美国代表迪安师承了乔埃和哈利逊的破坏本领，正在企图把关于政治会议问题的双方会谈变成又一次旷日持久的板门店停战谈判。
    迪安曾毫不掩饰地把他的拖延策略称之为“长时期的讨价还价”。迪安的这种“讨价还价”的策略使仅仅议程问题就讨论了三个星期。只是在迪安拒绝讨论成员问题的一切藉口都被驳斥和推翻了以后，他才不得不停止装腔作势地宣称他“无权”讨论这个问题，而同意将成员问题列为第一项议程。人们完全有理由希望这是迪安愿意老老实实讨论问题的一个表示，而不是一种仅仅用来欺骗世界舆论的花样。
    但是过去六天中关于成员、地点和时间问题的讨论情形证明：迪安仍然不愿意老老实实讨论并解决问题，而只是企图用种种无聊的问题来继续拖延时间，继续兜售他的拒绝中立国参加政治会议的诡计。
    在十七日关于成员和地点问题的小组委员会上，朝中方面提出了关于成员问题的完全合理的建议。这个建议主张政治会议采取双方对等会议的形式；会议的一切决定必须取得双方的一致同意；会议应由双方共同邀请苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸等五个有关中立国家参加，以保证会议能顺利进行。这个建议的合理性是如此明显，就是和美国一起参加朝鲜战争的英国，也认为朝中方面的建议是“一个令人注意的建议”，应该予以
  “仔细的考虑”。
    但是迪安却仍然企图否定成员问题。
    他所提出的两个“建议”实际上都是重弹反对中立国参加政治会议的老调。他的第一个“建议”说，美方只准备在“政治会议本身对朝鲜问题达成了完全满意的协议”之后，才“考虑增加政治会议参加者的问题”。他的第二个“建议”是，只有在政治会议召开之后，“并在其已对实质问题上花费了一段合理的时间之后”，当美方认为“如果政治会议发展过程显得有其他的参加者是合适的”的时候，美方才准备向美方所有其他参加政治会议者建议“在适当的时期内”、并在“上述限制之内”来
  “考虑这个问题”。
    显然，这里的第一个建议就是根本不许中立国参加政治会议。第二个建议就是美方所宣传的叫中立国来当什么“报告员”的意见。这当然也是不许中立国参加会议。美方明知朝中方面坚决主张政治会议要有中立国参加，但他们却偏要天天重复这些建议来反对中立国，这不是故意捣乱是什么？
    对于朝中方面十分清楚明白的建议，迪安却不肯在小组委员会上老老实实地展开讨论，而只是天天重复提出一个又一个已经答复了的问题，并且对中立国大肆污蔑，把它们和国民党匪帮相提并论。他企图根据美方对于成员问题的否定态度来片面解释朝中方面的建议，从而达到实质上取消中立国作用的目的。在二十三日开会以前，迪安又通过美国的宣传机器恫吓说，如果朝中方面在两三天之内不对他的这些“问题”作出使他满意的答复，他就要把朝中方面的建议“一笔勾销”。在二十三日会上，他对中立国的污蔑达到了新的高峰，他说中立国可能“延长讨论”，“带来你方所害怕的僵局”
  （显然美方是喜欢僵局，并且是时常故意制造僵局，来阻挠政治会议的召开的。），“使得政治会议遭到真正的困难和挫折”，“阻挠双方决议的达成”。照他的意思，好像中立国倒是要阻挠和破坏政治会议的。这一切胡说八道，充分证明迪安并不想认真考虑朝中方面的建议，他的一个又一个的“问题”，只不过是用来迷惑世界舆论的一种花样而已。
    关于政治会议的地点问题，迪安同样采取了毫不严肃的儿戏的态度，他居然建议把南美洲和佛朗哥西班牙的马德里作为会议地点。甚至合众社也说迪安提出的这些城市并不是认真的。迪安显然企图用这种不切实际的所谓“建议”来使讨论复杂化，以便于继续拖延。
    在会议的时间问题上，迪安在十六日发言中曾提出在十二月十五日召开政治会议。当朝中方面在十七日建议在十二月召开会议而不要定死一个具体日期时，美方还装模作样，主张立即在十二月中旬确定一个具体日期。但是随着美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋的发展，美方反而不要具体日期了。他们始而反对朝中方面后来提出的在第一项议程达成协议后的四周后召开政治会议的建议，接着又提出一项
  “新建议”，主张在各项议程完全达成协议以后不迟于四十二天召开政治会议，而这还要假定各项议程的达成不迟于十二月一日，否则就根本不确定政治会议召开的时间。美方在会议时间问题上这种反复无常的作法，显然是企图把政治会议无限期地拖延下去，或至少拖延到中立国遣返委员会接管战俘九十天甚至一百二十天之后，以便进一步在战俘问题上进行阴谋。
      过去一星期中美方的态度，进一步证明美方对于政治会议缺乏诚意。美国代理副国务卿墨菲上星期声称，如果政治会议不能举行的话，那该“完全归咎于”朝中方面。美国国务院现在有兴趣的显然不是举行政治会议的问题，而是如何使政治会议不能举行、并给自己推卸责任的问题。这种企图已经充分表现在迪安的拖延策略上。朝中方面已经警告迪安说，如果美方不想继续举行会谈，就应该明白表示，并负担破坏会谈的一切责任。
