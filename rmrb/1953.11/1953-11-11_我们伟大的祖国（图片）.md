Our Great Motherland

Since the establishment of the Kaili Miao Autonomous Region in Lushan County, Guizhou Province, agricultural production has significantly improved, transforming the Kaili mountainous area, which used to suffer from "disasters in nine out of ten years," into a region of continuous harvests and prosperity. This is the main agricultural crop of the Kaili Miao Autonomous Region - flue-cured tobacco, with an annual output of over one million catties. Miao farmer She Xingwen and his daughter are observing the abundant tobacco leaves in the field.
