    The Zhalantun Coal Industry Building Materials Company's Tile Factory Produces Inferior Bricks and Tiles
    Reader Zhao Shufang writes: Since May of this year, the tile factory affiliated with the Zhalantun Coal Industry Building Materials Company has frequently shipped bricks and tiles that have not absorbed enough water and are not completely dry, causing serious losses to state property and affecting the construction projects of user units. For example, of the 20,000 tiles ordered and transported by the Manzhouli Railway Bureau's capital construction project from this factory, many were damaged upon unloading at the station. Of the 9,500 pieces loaded in the first car, 1,200 were broken, and of the 9,000 pieces loaded in the second car, more than 3,000 were broken. Some were cracked in half, some were broken into small pieces, and some broke with the slightest touch. This has affected the progress and quality of construction projects. Similarly, the Yakeshi Forest Industry Bureau purchased 50,000 tiles from the factory, and about 7,000 were damaged upon arrival. Of the 100,000 bricks and tiles ordered by the Construction Committee of the Eastern District Administrative Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Hailar City, 20,000 were damaged. Many other units that ordered goods from the factory have also reported that the bricks and tiles produced by the factory are of inferior quality.
    Why is the damage rate of bricks and tiles produced by the Zhalantun Coal Construction Company's tile factory so high? The reason is that many units order bricks and tiles from the factory, and the order volume is very large; however, the factory blindly accepts a large number of orders without considering its actual production capacity. Because it cannot deliver the goods on time, the factory loads and delivers bricks and tiles that have not absorbed enough water and are not completely dry. Such bricks and tiles are naturally easily damaged and will also affect the project quality of the user units. It is hoped that the Zhalantun Coal Industry Building Materials Company will quickly inspect and correct this crude and shoddy style of its affiliated tile factory and urge the factory to improve product quality.

### 札兰屯煤业建筑器材公司制瓦厂所产砖瓦质量低劣

专栏：读者来信摘要

    札兰屯煤业建筑器材公司制瓦厂所产砖瓦质量低劣
    读者赵树芳来信：札兰屯煤业建筑器材公司附属制瓦厂从今年五月以来经常把吸水不足、尚未干透的砖瓦向外装运，造成国家财产的严重损失，并影响了使用单位的工程建设。例如满洲里铁路分局基本建设工程向这个厂订购和提运的两万块瓦，在到站卸货时损坏很多。第一车装的九千五百块中坏了一千二百块，第二车装的九千块中坏了三千多块。其中有的裂成两半，有的碎成小块，有的轻轻一放就碎。这就影响了建筑工程的进度和质量。又如牙克石森林工业局向该厂采购五万块瓦，运到时损坏了七千块上下。海拉尔市内蒙古自治区东部区行署修建委员会订购的十万块砖瓦中，有两万块损坏。其它不少向该厂订货的单位，也都反映该厂生产的砖瓦质量低劣。
    为什么札兰屯煤建公司制瓦厂所产砖瓦的损坏率这样大呢？原因是：向该厂订购砖瓦的单位很多，订购量很大；该厂却不根据实际生产能力，盲目、大量接受订货。因为到期不能交货，该厂就把吸水不足、尚未干透的砖瓦装运交出。这样的砖瓦当然容易损坏，而且还会影响使用单位的工程质量。希望札兰屯煤业建筑器材公司迅速检查和纠正所属制瓦厂这种粗制滥造的作风，督促该厂提高产品质量。
