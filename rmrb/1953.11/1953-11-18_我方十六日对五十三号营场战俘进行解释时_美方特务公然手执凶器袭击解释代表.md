Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 16th: After an eight-day suspension, the explanation work resumed today through the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side. Today, the Korean-Chinese side provided explanations to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army at Camp 53, and six captured personnel applied for repatriation.

During today's explanation process, the Syngman Rhee special agents adopted new methods of sabotage, such as pretending to request repatriation and then taking the opportunity to attack the explanation representatives, and trying to waste as much time as possible. As a result, only 203 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp 53 heard one explanation.

In many explanation tents, special agents rushed forward to tear off the epaulettes of the explanation representatives, or used disinfectant powder, chili powder, stones, and small knives to harm the explanation representatives. In tent number 8, a special agent hit the explanation representative with a table and tore off the explanation representative's epaulettes. He even openly provoked the explanation representative and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, saying: "Now, our tactics have changed!" In the same tent, a special agent pretended to be willing to listen to the explanation. The explanation representative approached him to talk. Suddenly, he pulled out a dagger that had been prepared in his left pocket and stabbed the explanation representative. Indian soldiers grabbed his hand. He threw the dagger out, and it brushed past the explanation representative's face. Some special agents also hit Indian soldiers and the Indian chairman.

Another method used by the Syngman Rhee special agents to obstruct the explanation work was to make a lot of noise, delay time, and refuse to leave the tent. In tent number 21, one person made noise for a full hour and twenty-four minutes. In tent number 5, the chairman of the affiliated agency asked a noisy special agent to leave twice. He refused to leave. As a result, another hour and five minutes was wasted.

In addition to ordering special agents posing as POWs to carry out sabotage, the U.S. side today gave special importance to the Syngman Rhee "representatives" and translators who appeared publicly in the tents. These people wore a clear Syngman Rhee Taeguk emblem on their arms today to threaten the POWs. In tent number 18, the chairman of the affiliated agency originally said to the POWs: "Don't make noise, be quiet!" The Syngman Rhee translator translated it as: "You have to show the prestige of the Republic of Korea!" As a result, the POW immediately started making noise again. The chairman of tent number 17 asked the POWs to be quiet, but the Syngman Rhee translator walked up to the POW and said: "If you are quiet, you can leave through this door now and go to the door of the Republic of Korea!" In tent number 12, when the Indian chairman warned a POW not to make noise, the Syngman Rhee translator actually said: "The chairman agrees with you doing this." The chairman had to warn him that he would be kicked out if he did it again. In the same tent, the "observation representative" of the Syngman Rhee group said to a POW: "I am sorry that I was not able to greet you today." After the explanation representative protested, the Indian chairman immediately warned the so-called "representative": if he did it again, "I will have to ask you to leave." The American "detaining party" representative in tent number 11 smiled maliciously at the POWs twice. With the unanimous agreement of the affiliated agency of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the chairman issued him a warning. In tent number 7, the explanation representative asked the Indian chairman to stop the special agents from making noise, but the U.S. observation representative said that this violated the "POWs' freedom of rights," causing the explanation to be interrupted for thirty minutes.

Due to the above-mentioned planned sabotage and disturbances, the actual explanation time was extremely short. For example, in explanation tent number 5, explanations were given to a total of nine POWs today. The total time that the POWs stayed in the tent was six hours and fourteen minutes. Excluding the time spent making noise and the time spent on interruptions and negotiations due to various interferences by the U.S. side, the actual explanation time was only two hours and forty-eight minutes. On average, each of the nine POWs only listened to the explanation for a little over eighteen minutes.

Although the U.S. side used every means to force the POWs not to dare to apply for repatriation, six captured personnel still broke through their fears and bravely applied for repatriation during the explanation today. One of them stayed in the explanation tent for two hours and twenty-five minutes. When this POW entered the tent, he looked fearfully at the U.S. observation representative and the "detaining party" representative, and muttered reluctantly: "Tell me quickly! I don't want to listen, I want to go out." However, he sat down and listened to the explanation. However, he kept looking back at the U.S. observation representative. After an hour of explanation, he still looked at this door and that door, and did not dare to make a decision. Later, our representatives repeatedly told him that no one here could stop him from requesting repatriation. At this time, another POW in the neighboring explanation tent applied for repatriation, shouting "Long live the Republic!" and walked out of the door. This POW suddenly tore off the symbols with reactionary words written on his hat and chest and applied for repatriation.

### 我方十六日对五十三号营场战俘进行解释时  美方特务公然手执凶器袭击解释代表

    我方十六日对五十三号营场战俘进行解释时
    美方特务公然手执凶器袭击解释代表
    【新华社开城十六日电】解释工作连续停顿八天后，经过朝中方面的努力，在今天恢复进行。朝中方面今天向第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行了解释，六名被俘人员申请遣返。
    在今天的解释过程中，李承晚特务采取了新的破坏方法，如假装要求遣返然后乘机袭击解释代表，并尽可能地消磨时间。因此，第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员只有二百零三名听了一次解释。
    在许多解释帐篷里，特务分子扑过来撕解释代表的肩章，或用消毒粉、辣椒面、石块和小刀来伤害解释代表。在第八号帐篷，有一个特务分子用桌子撞击解释代表，并撕了解释代表的肩章。他竟公开对解释代表和中立国遣返委员会挑衅说：“现在，我们的战术改变了！”在同一个帐篷中，有一个特务假装愿意听解释。解释代表和他接近谈话。忽然，他把左边口袋里早已准备好的匕首抽出来，向解释代表刺去。印度士兵抓住了他的手。他就把匕首抛掷出去，匕首从解释代表脸旁擦过。有的特务分子还打了印度士兵和印度主席。
    李承晚特务阻挠解释工作的另一方法是大吵大闹，拖延时间，不肯离开帐篷。在第二十一号帐篷，有一个人整整吵闹了一点零二十四分钟。在第五号帐篷，附属机构主席两次叫一个吵闹的特务分子走。他不肯走。结果，又拖了一小时零五分。
    美方除了命令冒充战俘的特务进行破坏以外，今天特别重用了公开出现在帐篷中的李承晚“代表”和翻译。这些人今天在臂上挂了一个明显的李承晚太极徽记，用来威胁战俘。在十八号帐篷，附属机构主席本来对战俘说：“不要闹，放安静些！”李承晚翻译却翻成：“你要把大韩民国威风使出来！”因而这个战俘又顿时吵闹起来。第十七号帐篷的主席叫战俘安静些，李承晚翻译却走到战俘跟前说：“你安静些，现在就可以走这个门，上大韩民国的门！”在第十二号帐篷，印度主席警告一个战俘不要吵闹的时候，李承晚翻译竟说成：“主席同意你这样做。”使得主席不得不警告他下次再这样就把他赶出去。在同一个帐篷，李承晚集团的“观察代表”对一个战俘说：“我很抱歉，今天没有能向你问候。”解释代表提出抗议后，印度主席当即警告这个所谓“代表”：如果下次再这样做，“我就要叫你出去”。在第十一号帐篷里的美国“拘留方”代表，两次向战俘恶意地笑，经中立国遣返委员会附属机构一致同意，主席向他提出了警告。在第七号帐篷，解释代表请印度主席制止特务分子吵闹，美方观察代表竟说这是违反“战俘自由权利”，使解释中断三十分钟。
    由于上述种种有计划的破坏和捣乱，实际进行解释的时间就极其短促。如在第五号解释帐篷中，今天共向九个战俘进行解释。战俘停留在帐篷内的总时间是六小时十四分，除去吵闹时间以及由于美方种种干扰而使解释中断和交涉的时间，实际解释的时间只有二小时四十八分。以九个战俘平均，每人只听取了十八分钟多一点的解释。
    虽然美方用尽一切手段来迫使战俘不敢申请遣返，但今天仍有六名被俘人员在解释时打破疑惧，勇敢地申请遣返。其中一个曾在解释帐篷里留了两小时二十五分。这个战俘一进帐篷恐惧地看着美方观察代表和“拘留方”代表，嘴里勉强地喃喃说：“你快讲吧！我不愿听，我要出去。”但是，身子却坐了下来听取解释。然而，他仍不断地回头看美方观察代表。解释到一小时的时候，他还是看看这个门，看看那个门，不敢下决心。后来，我方代表又反复地告诉他，在这里任何人不能阻止他要求遣返。这时，隔壁解释帐篷里有另一个战俘申请遣返了，高呼着“共和国万岁！”从门口走过。这个战俘突然猛力撕下帽子上和胸前写着反动字样的符号，申请遣返。
