Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 8th. TASS reports: Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report at the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled: "The Party's Tasks in the Current Stage of Socialist Construction in the Struggle to Rapidly Improve the Living Standards of the Working People."

Bierut pointed out the necessity of convening the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, and said that the Political Bureau suggests that the Central Committee take the outlines of "Achievements Since the Implementation of the Six-Year Plan and the Main Economic Tasks for the Last Two Years of the Six-Year Plan (1954 and 1955)" and "The Tasks for Developing Agriculture in 1954 and 1955 and the Necessary Measures to Increase Agricultural Production" as the basis for discussion before the convening of the Congress.

Bierut said that we have entered the last quarter of the fourth year of the Six-Year Plan. We call our Six-Year Plan the plan for the industrialization of Poland and the laying of the socialist foundation. We believe that national industrialization is a necessary condition for laying the socialist foundation. After several years of intense and selfless labor by the working people, a solid foundation for the new socialist economy has now been laid in all sectors of the national economy except agriculture. This is a solid and great achievement of historical significance for the Polish working class and the working people in urban and rural areas. Socialist construction must be based on the task of creating conditions to ensure the continuous improvement of the welfare of the working people in urban and rural areas. This task is of fundamental significance for all people's democratic countries.

Bierut then spoke about the achievements of Polish industrial production and compared the development of Polish industry with that of countries such as Italy and France. He said that today, the output of industrial products in People's Poland, whether in terms of per capita output or in terms of absolute output, exceeds that of Italy. Compared with France, the current per capita output of industrial products in Poland is already about 92 percent of the current level in France, and there is no doubt that we will surpass it.

Bierut said that to continuously and rapidly improve living standards, it is necessary to establish the necessary economic foundation, and to establish the necessary economic foundation, it is necessary to make many efforts and contributions. Completing the tasks of the Six-Year Plan for further rapid development of productive forces and realizing the national industrialization plan in the sectors of decisive significance to the national economy is closely related to the struggle to accelerate the improvement of the people's welfare. Hindering this is the backwardness of agricultural development. The uneven development of certain sectors of the national economy is also an obstacle. The development of the national economy must follow the proportions of the various sectors stipulated in the Six-Year Plan, so now it is necessary to concentrate efforts to develop those economic sectors that are necessary to accelerate the improvement of the living standards of workers and farmers. We must continue to strive to industrialize the country, further strengthen our national defense forces, continuously expand the technical base, continuously develop productive forces, and maximize the productive potential of all sectors of the national economy. However, we must now also give priority to concentrating our efforts on developing those economic sectors that, for various reasons, remain backward to this day and cannot keep up with the development speed of advanced industrial sectors.

Bierut pointed out that the current extremely important tasks of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government are: to increase overall agricultural production and meet the growing demand for investment in agriculture; to fundamentally reorganize the work of state-owned machine and tractor stations and machine rental stations on the basis of increasing mechanization; to vigorously develop those machine manufacturing sectors that serve agriculture in the near future; to reduce the degree of imbalance in the development of the means of production and the means of subsistence; to improve the quality of industrial products as much as possible; to vigorously improve public trade; to implement a policy of gradually reducing the prices of daily necessities; to revise the current construction plan in order to vigorously expand the construction of new workers' residential areas and new housing; to strengthen public utilities and develop urban and suburban transportation; and to further expand schools, cultural and educational institutions, sports fields, medical and health institutions, and institutions related to the cultural needs and welfare of the broad masses of working people.

Bierut emphasized that to complete the above-mentioned tasks in the last two years of the Six-Year Plan, we first need to redeploy our forces and mobilize everyone in order to rapidly push the backward economic sectors forward and resolutely reduce the imbalances that have already occurred, and first and foremost, to increase agricultural production. In order to complete the prescribed tasks, it is necessary to mobilize and correctly allocate the necessary manpower and material resources and invest all funds into new and great battles on all fronts of the national economy. For this purpose, it is especially necessary to utilize all the potential in small-commodity individual agriculture, while ensuring that public and private agricultural production (including crop cultivation and animal husbandry) can be significantly increased throughout agriculture through the development of agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms. Bierut said: Our task is to constantly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, our task is to strengthen and expand economic incentives for farmers and increase their material benefits, so that they can increase agricultural production within the scope of the state-regulated urban-rural economic integration, and at the same time overcome the capitalist tendencies of wealthy farmers in agriculture. Our task is to vigorously strengthen assistance to agriculture with investment, thereby promoting the increase in the labor productivity of small-commodity economy, cooperatives, and state-owned agriculture. Our task is to help millions of small and medium farmers overcome the backwardness and conservatism that have existed for many years in labor methods and soil cultivation methods, where the yield of this soil is very low due to outdated and simple cultivation conditions for plant cultivation and animal husbandry product production.

Bierut said that it is necessary to vigorously rectify the leadership of various agricultural departments. Bierut emphasized that not long ago, the leadership of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party set a brilliant example for us, telling us how to carefully, comprehensively, and thoroughly formulate work plans for party, state, economic, and Soviet agencies at all levels to ensure the rapid increase of agricultural and animal husbandry production. In the Soviet Union, in this country with the highest degree of agricultural mechanization and equipped with high technology, its task in agriculture is to produce very abundant agricultural products in this new and highest stage of building a communist society. The decision of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on measures for the further development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Soviet Union should also become the basis and guiding instructions for every one of our party and state activists in realizing the tasks put forward by our party in this regard.

Bierut also spoke about the shortcomings in the work of state-owned machine and tractor stations in Poland, and pointed out the methods to eliminate the shortcomings.

When talking about state agricultural work, Bierut pointed out that state-owned farms now have a land area of 2.5 million hectares, accounting for about 12 percent of Poland's total arable land. In the total commodity production of the entire agriculture, the output of state-owned farms accounts for about 15 percent. The total output of state-owned farms has greatly increased compared with 1949, but state-owned farms still cannot complete the production plan. Bierut said that state-owned farms can and should become the cornerstone and brilliant example of large-scale, mechanized, and highly productive agricultural production using the latest achievements of agricultural science and advanced technology. Bierut then said that the development of agricultural production cooperatives in agriculture can be seen from the establishment of more than 8,000 cooperatives. This year, the speed and scale of this development have played a significant role. This year, 3,000 new cooperatives have been established, the number of members in the old cooperatives has increased, the cooperative economy has been consolidated and expanded, and public animal husbandry has developed. The number of cattle, sheep, and pigs, whether belonging to the public economy or private, has rapidly increased. The development of the public economy in rural areas is not only a great revolutionary victory for the advanced working farmers, but also a victory for the working class and a victory for the worker-peasant alliance. Now we can already say that this is a historical transformation that has already begun in the Polish countryside, a transformation of the most fundamental foundations of the lives and customs of millions of rural residents, and this transformation can no longer be stopped by anyone. Bierut described the work experience of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, talked about the superiority of collective agriculture, the management of various agricultural economic cooperatives, and the state's assistance to agricultural production cooperatives.

Regarding the more comprehensive satisfaction of the needs of the working people and the improvement of their living standards, Bierut said that our national income is the main source of funds we use for building and consolidating our national economy. Three-quarters of our national income is used to meet the needs of the working people, such as paying wages and social needs expenditures. In the first four years of the Six-Year Plan, the national income increased by 60 percent compared with the level in 1949. However, the rate of increase in national income is lower than the target set by the Six-Year Plan for this period. The rate of increase in national income is relatively slow because the increase in agricultural production is much slower than planned.

Bierut then said that by 1955, investment in agriculture and forestry will be 45 percent more than in 1953, that is to say, the proportion of funds in this area in the total investment will increase from 9 percent to 12.2 percent. By 1955, investment in the development of the daily necessities industry will be 38 percent more than in 1953, that is to say, the proportion of funds in this area in the total investment will increase from 6.7 percent to 8.5 percent. Investment in housing and public buildings will increase by 26 percent, that is to say, the proportion of funds in this area in the total investment will increase from 13.4 percent to 15.6 percent. By 1955, investment in the construction of social and cultural institutions will be 34 percent more than in 1953, that is to say, the proportion of funds in this area in the total investment will increase from 4.3 percent to 5.3 percent. The reason why the investment in agriculture, forestry, the daily necessities industry, housing and public buildings, and the construction of social and cultural institutions can be increased in the total investment is because the investment in the development of industries producing means of production and other sectors has been slightly reduced.

Bierut emphasized that the party's tasks in leading the class struggle in rural areas and improving agriculture are closely related to the basic policy of urban-rural relations. The principle that determines this relationship is: the working class and the working farmers form an inseparable and solid alliance, which is led by the working class, relies on poor peasants, and politically isolates wealthy farmers. This is the main programmatic principle of our party during the period of socialist construction. After Bierut detailed the shortcomings of the party's work in rural areas, he said that working farmers need help, they need to be explained what agricultural production cooperatives are, what their goals are, what they bring to farmers, and when they organize agricultural production cooperatives in their own villages, they need the same help. However, this help will only be particularly valuable when it inspires their own initiative, when they feel that this help is not violating their will, and when this help becomes real help rather than an order. In this work, it is necessary to fight against both close-doorism and opportunism more strictly and resolutely than ever before. We must learn to wage a two-front struggle in a Bolshevik way, because we must never forget that the danger of taking an opportunistic compromise attitude towards the influence of wealthy farmers is no less than close-doorism, because wealthy farmers are trying to hinder the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, it is also necessary to resolutely fight against this danger. Bierut said that improving agriculture and eliminating the main disproportionate phenomenon caused by agriculture being too backward compared to the overall speed of national economic development is the most important part of the task of rapidly improving the living standards of the working people in urban and rural areas. The whole party should put out more strength to victoriously complete these tasks in the shortest possible time.

Bierut finally said that strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and fighting for the rapid improvement of the living standards of the working masses in urban and rural areas is a powerful driving force for consolidating the strength and unity of our national front, and our national front is a front fighting for peace, for the Six-Year Plan, and for the complete victory of socialism!

    贝鲁特在波兰统一工人党中央全会上作报告
    党在社会主义建设现阶段中为尽速提高劳动人民生活水平而斗争的任务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙八日电：波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席波列斯瓦夫·贝鲁特，在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第九次全体会议上作了报告，报告的题目是：“党在社会主义建设现阶段中为尽速提高劳动人民生活水平而斗争的任务”。
    贝鲁特指出必须召开波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会，并且说，政治局建议中央委员会把“六年计划实行以来的成就和六年计划最后两年（一九五四年和一九五五年）的主要经济任务”及“一九五四年和一九五五年发展农业的任务与提高农业生产的必要措施”这两个提纲，作为代表大会召开前进行讨论的基础。
    贝鲁特说，我们已进入六年计划第四年的最后一个季度。我们把我们的六年计划称为波兰工业化计划和奠定社会主义基础的计划。我们认为国家工业化是奠定社会主义基础的必要条件。经过劳动人民几年紧张忘我的劳动后，现在除了农业外，国民经济各部门都已打下社会主义新经济的牢固的基础。这是波兰工人阶级、城乡劳动人民的具有历史意义的坚实的巨大的成果。社会主义建设要以创造条件保证城乡劳动人民的福利不断提高这一任务作为基础。各人民民主国家的这一任务具有原则性的意义就在这里。
    贝鲁特接着谈到波兰工业生产的成就，并把波兰工业发展的情况跟意大利、法国这样一些国家的工业发展情况作了比较。他说，今天人民波兰的工业品产量，不论是在人口平均产量方面，或者在绝对产量方面，都超过了意大利。和法国比较，目前波兰工业产品的人口平均产量已经约为法国现有水平的百分之九十二，毫无疑问，我们是一定也会超过它的。
    贝鲁特说，要不断迅速提高生活水平，就必须建立必要的经济基础，而要建立必要的经济基础，就必须作许多的努力和贡献。完成进一步迅速发展生产力的六年计划的任务，并在国民经济具有决定意义的部门实现国家工业化计划，这是跟加速提高人民福利的斗争密切相关的。在这方面发生阻碍作用的是农业发展的落后。国民经济某些部门发展的不均衡也是一种障碍，国民经济的发展必须按照六年计划所规定的各个部门的比例，所以现在要集中力量来发展那些为加速提高工人和农民生活水平所必需的经济部门。我们要继续努力使国家工业化，进一步加强我们的国防力量，不断扩大技术基础，不断发展生产力和尽量发挥国民经济各部门的生产潜力。不过，我们现在同时要首先集中力量来发展那些由于种种原因到今天仍然是落后的、赶不上先进工业部门发展速度的那些经济部门。
    贝鲁特指出，波兰统一工人党和波兰政府在当前的极其重大的任务是：提高整个农业生产，满足农业对于投资的日益增长的需求；在提高机械化程度的基础上根本改组国家机器拖拉机站和机器租赁站的工作；在最近期间大力发展那些为农业服务的机器制造部门；减低生产资料和生活资料发展不均衡的程度；尽量改善工业产品质量；大力改进公营贸易；实行逐步降低日用品价格的政策；修改目前的建设计划，以便大力扩大新工人住宅区和新住宅的建设；加强公用事业、发展市内市郊交通；进一步扩充学校、文化教育机关、运动场、医疗休养机关以及关系广大劳动群众文化需要和生活福利的机关。
    贝鲁特着重指出，要在六年计划的最后二年内完成上述任务，首先需要我们重新部署力量，动员大家，以求迅速地把落后的经济部门推向前去，坚决缩小已经发生的不均衡的情况，而首先是提高农业生产。为了完成规定的任务，必须动员并正确分配必要的人力物力，把所有资金投到国民经济各个战线上的新的巨大的战斗中去。为了这个目的，特别需要利用小商品个体农业中的一切潜力，同时通过发展农业生产合作社和国营农场的办法，保证整个农业中的公私农业生产（包括种植业和饲畜业）能够显著提高。贝鲁特说：我们的任务是要经常不断地巩固工农联盟，我们的任务是要加强并扩大对农民的经济鼓励和增加他们的物质利益，使他们在国家调剂的城乡经济结合的范围内，提高农业生产，并同时克服农业中富农分子的资本主义倾向。我们的任务是要用投资来大力加强对农业的帮助，从而促进小商品经济、合作社和国营农业的劳动生产率的提高。我们的任务是要帮助成百万的小农和中农，克服许多年代以来在劳动方式和土壤耕作法方面存在着的落后现象和保守主义，这种土壤由于植物种植和饲畜业产品生产的过时的和简陋的耕作条件收获量很低。
    贝鲁特说，必须要大力整顿对农业各部门的领导。贝鲁特着重说，不久以前苏联共产党中央委员会的领导为我们树立了一个光辉的榜样，告诉我们应当如何慎重地、全面地和详细地制定各级党、国家、经济机关、苏维埃机关的工作计划，以保证农业和饲畜业生产的迅速增加。在苏联，在这个农业机械化程度最高、并已用高度的技术装备起来的国家中，它在农业方面的任务已是在建设共产主义社会这个新的最高阶段中生产非常丰富的农产品。苏共中央关于苏联进一步发展农业和饲畜业的措施的决定，也应当成为我们每一个党和国家的活动家在实现我们的党在这方面所提出的任务时的依据和指导性的指示。
    贝鲁特还讲到波兰国家机器拖拉机站工作中的缺点，并指出消灭缺点的方法。
    贝鲁特谈到国家农业工作时指出，现在国营农场拥有的土地面积为二百五十万公顷，即占波兰全部耕地百分之十二左右。在整个农业的商品生产总产量中，国营农场的产量已占百分之十五左右。国营农场的总产量是比一九四九年大大地提高了，但是国营农场还是不能完成生产计划。贝鲁特说道，国营农场能够而且也应该成为运用最新的农业科学和先进技术的成就而进行大规模的、机械化的、生产率高的农业生产的基石和辉煌的榜样。贝鲁特接着说，在农业中农业生产合作社的发展，可以从建立了八千多个合作社这一点看出来，今年这种发展的速度和规模具有重大的作用。今年，建立了三千个新的合作社，旧有合作社的社员人数增加了，合作社经济巩固和扩大了，公有饲畜业发展了，无论属于公有经济的还是私人的牛、羊、猪的头数都迅速增多了。农村中公有经济的发展，不仅是先进的劳动农民群众的伟大的革命胜利，而且是工人阶级的胜利，工农联盟的胜利。现在我们已经可以说，这是波兰农村中现已开始的一个历史性的转变，这是千百万农村居民的生活和习俗的各种最根本的基础的转变，这个转变已经是任何人所不能阻止的了。贝鲁特叙述了先进的农业生产合作社的工作经验，谈到了集体农业的优越性，谈到了多种农业经济的合作社的管理、以及国家对农业生产合作社的帮助。
    关于更全面地满足劳动人民的需要和提高他们的生活水平方面，贝鲁特说道，我们的国民收入就是我们用于建设和巩固我们国民经济的资金的主要来源。我国国民收入的四分之三都是用来满足劳动人民的需求的，如支付工资和社会需要的开支等。在六年计划的头四年中，国民收入比一九四九年的水平提高了百分之六十。但是，国民收入提高的速度低于六年计划为这个时期规定的目标。国民收入提高的速度比较缓慢，这是因为农业生产的提高远比计划规定的要慢得多。
    贝鲁特接着说，到一九五五年农业和林业方面的投资，将比一九五三年多百分之四十五，也就是说，这一方面的资金在投资总额中所占的比例，将由百分之九增加到百分之十二点二。到一九五五年，发展日用品工业方面的投资将比一九五三年增加百分之三十八，也就是说，这一方面的资金在投资总额中所占的比例，将由百分之六点七增到八点五。住宅和公用建筑方面的投资将增加百分之二十六，也就是说，这一方面的资金在投资总额中的比例将由百分之十三点四增到百分之十五点六。到一九五五年，社会和文化机关建设方面的投资将比一九五三年增加百分之三十四，也就是说，这一方面的资金在投资总额中的比例将由百分之四点三增加到五点三。在投资总额中，对农业、林业、日用品工业、住宅和公用建筑、以及社会文化机关建筑等方面的投资部分之所以能够增加，是因为对发展生产生产资料的工业及其他部门的投资稍微减少了一些。
    贝鲁特着重指出，党在领导农村中阶级斗争和提高农业方面的任务，是和城乡关系的基本方针紧密关联的。而决定这种关系的原则是：工人阶级和劳动农民结成不可分割的巩固联盟，这种联盟以工人阶级为领导，依靠贫农，在政治上孤立富农。这是我们党在社会主义建设时期主要的纲领性的原则。贝鲁特详细地指出了党在乡村工作中的缺点之后说，劳动农民需要帮助，需要对他们解释：农业生产合作社是什么样的东西，它的目标是什么，它给农民带来什么，当他们在自己的村子里组织农业生产合作社的时候他们需要同样的帮助。然而，只有当这种帮助启发了他们自己的主动性，他们认为这种帮助不是在违反他们的自愿的时候，只有当这种帮助成为一种真正的帮助而不是一种命令的时候，这种帮助才会是特别有价值的帮助。在这个工作中，必须比以往更严厉、更坚决地既和关门主义斗争，又和机会主义作斗争。必须学会布尔什维克式地进行两条战线的斗争，因为我们一刻也不应忘记：对富农的影响采取机会主义的妥协态度，其危险性并不小于关门主义，因为富农正在竭力阻挠农业合作社的迅速发展。因此，也必须和这种危险进行坚决的斗争。贝鲁特说，提高农业以及消除由于农业过分落后于国民经济发展总速度而造成的、主要的不成比例的现象，是迅速提高城乡劳动人民生活水准这一任务中的最重要的一环。全党应当拿出更大的力量，尽可能地在最短期内胜利地完成这些任务。
    贝鲁特最后说，加强工农联盟，为迅速提高城乡劳动群众生活水平而斗争乃是巩固我们的全国阵线的力量和团结的强大动力，而我们的全国阵线是为和平、为六年计划、为社会主义彻底胜利而斗争的阵线！
