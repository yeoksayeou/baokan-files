Shenyang City is combining its central tasks and theoretical study to vigorously promote the general line and general task of the state during the transition period among cadres, workers, suburban farmers, industrialists and merchants, and citizens throughout the city.

Shenyang City has stipulated that the period from now until the Spring Festival will be a concentrated phase for publicizing the general line and general task, after which it will shift to regular study. During the concentrated publicity phase, people from all walks of life will be mobilized to actively complete the first year's work of the first Five-Year Plan and lay an ideological foundation for the country's construction work next year.

Recently, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, He Xia, Deputy Secretary, and Jiao Ruoyu, Mayor of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, have each made reports on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period to cadres above the section chief level in the city. Starting in late November, the secretaries of the Party committees or administrative heads of various organs, factories, and schools will personally make reports and organize cadres to study relevant documents, with an estimated participation of more than 100,000 people. Through this publicity campaign, a new high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement will be launched among the broad masses of workers, encouraging the working masses to strive to complete this year's national construction plan and increase production and practice economy plan, and to prepare ideologically for the completion of next year's national construction plan. At present, nearly 30,000 propagandists and reporters in the city are actively preparing for publicity. In the rural areas on the outskirts of the city, publicity will be carried out in conjunction with central tasks such as grain purchase, mutual aid and cooperation, and general elections. The political lessons of this winter study program will focus on studying the general line and general task. Currently, more than 500 cadres have been transferred throughout the city to form 20 work teams to go deep into the suburbs to publicize the general line and general task. The work teams will also display pictures of Soviet collective farms and show movies in the countryside. The publicity of the general line and general task will also be vigorously carried out among cadres and workers in basic construction winter training, and it is estimated that 20,000 basic construction workers will participate in the study. In addition, the study of the general line and general task by various democratic parties and industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang City has already begun; publicity and education for street residents have also been launched.
