    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th: According to Indonesian newspapers, the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party held a plenary session in Jakarta from October 6th to 8th to discuss the party program, organizational issues, etc.
    General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, delivered a general report on the political situation and party organization at the meeting. Aidit listed the foreign policy of the Indonesian Communist Party as follows: continue to strive to defend peace and prevent war, strengthen cooperation between Indonesia and all peace-loving countries; strive for economic and cultural cooperation between Indonesia and other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, support every people's movement for complete national independence; work to consolidate the victory of peace achieved in the Korean armistice, oppose the revival of Japanese and West German militarism, and oppose the conspiracy to provoke a new war in Germany; strive to make the United Nations' status conform to the provisions of its charter, strive for the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations, and demand that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty; strive to abolish treaties that contain the nature of undermining Indonesian independence and peace.
    Aidit said: Dutch imperialism is the greatest enemy of the Indonesian people. Therefore, the primary task of the national united front is to end the rule of Dutch imperialism. To achieve complete national independence, it is necessary to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Union, nationalize Dutch enterprises, and recover West Irian, which is part of Indonesian territory. Aidit also said that the Indonesian Communist Party will strive to unite all strata, especially to strengthen unity with the peasants, who account for 70% of the total population.
    The meeting adopted Aidit's report and decided to convene the Fifth Party Congress to discuss the party program.
    The meeting also elected Aidit as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman as First Deputy General Secretary, and Njoto as Second Deputy General Secretary.
    Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 14th (TASS): The Dutch newspaper "De Waarheid" reported from Indonesia that Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered a speech at a mass meeting in Surabaya, explaining the party's policies. Three thousand people attended the mass meeting, including representatives from various political parties and mass organizations. Representatives of military and political authorities, such as the Governor and the Mayor of Surabaya, also attended the meeting.
    A few days later, Aidit delivered a speech on the international situation at a mass meeting attended by 100,000 people. He pointed out that the war preparations being carried out by the United States are jeopardizing the independence of countries under American influence. Indonesia must not allow any foreign country to suppress it, including the United States. Indonesia must implement a foreign policy that conforms to the interests of the Indonesian people. Aidit then pointed out that the Indonesian people have no other way but to strengthen the movement to defend peace in order to prevent new wars and ease international tensions. Aidit said: It is undeniable that in Indonesia, foreign forces, especially Dutch imperialism, are still rampant. Among foreign capital in Indonesia, Dutch imperialism controls 70%. Therefore, Dutch imperialism is the main enemy of the Indonesian people, and the Indonesian people must first end the rule of Dutch imperialism.
    In order to eliminate the current economic crisis, the Indonesian Communist Party has formulated a program and has submitted it to the government. One of the items in the program is: to demand that the government must refuse to accept the trade restrictions forcibly imposed on Indonesia by the United States.
    Aidit said: The Indonesian Communist Party is tirelessly striving for cooperation with various democratic parties; he called on all political parties, organizations, factions, and every person of goodwill to strengthen national unity so that the Republic of Indonesia can defeat the "Darul Islam movement," a terrorist organization, and overcome the increasingly felt economic crisis.

    印尼共产党中央举行全会讨论党的纲领
    总书记艾地号召人民结束荷帝国主义的统治
    【新华社十七日讯】雅加达消息：据印尼报纸刊载：印尼共产党中央委员会于十月六日到八日在雅加达举行全体会议，讨论了党的纲领、组织问题等。
    印尼共产党总书记艾地在会上作了关于政治形势和党的组织的总报告。艾地列举印尼共产党的对外政策如下：继续为保卫和平、防止战争而奋斗，加强印尼与各爱好和平国家的合作；在平等互惠的基础上争取印尼与各国间经济文化的合作，支持每一个为争取民族完全独立的人民运动；致力于巩固取得朝鲜停战的和平的胜利，反对日本、西德军国主义的复活，反对在德国挑起新战争的阴谋；为使联合国的地位符合于它的宪章的规定而奋斗，争取中华人民共和国参加联合国，要求五大国缔结和平公约；为取消含有破坏印尼独立与和平的性质的条约而奋斗。
    艾地说：荷兰帝国主义是印尼人民的最大敌人，因此，民族统一战线的首要任务是结束荷兰帝国主义的统治。要达到民族完全独立，必须取消荷兰—印尼联邦，把荷兰的企业收归国有，把印尼领土一部分的西伊里安收回。艾地并说：印尼共产党将努力团结各阶层，特别是加强和占总人口百分之七十的农民的团结。
    会议通过了艾地的报告，并决定召开第五次党代表大会讨论党的纲领。
    会议并选举了艾地任印尼共产党中央委员会总书记，鲁克曼任第一副总书记，约多任第二副总书记。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社海牙十四日讯：荷兰“真理报”自印度尼西亚发出消息：印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在泗水的一个群众大会上发表演说，解释党的政策。参加这次群众大会的有三千人，其中有各政治党派和群众团体的代表。省长和泗水市长等军政当局代表也参加了这一大会。
    过了几天之后，艾地又在一个有十万人参加的群众大会上发表了关于国际形势的演说。他指出：美国所进行的战争准备危害着在美国影响之下的国家的独立。印度尼西亚必须不容许任何外国来压制它，这包括美国在内。印度尼西亚必须实行符合于印度尼西亚人民利益的外交政策。艾地接着指出：除了加强保卫和平的运动以防止新的战争并缓和国际紧张局势之外，印尼人民是没有其他道路的。艾地说：不可否认，在印度尼西亚，外国势力特别是荷兰帝国主义还在逞威作福。在印度尼西亚的外国资本中，荷兰帝国主义掌握了百分之七十。因此，荷兰帝国主义是印度尼西亚人民的主要敌人，而印度尼西亚人民首先必须结束荷兰帝国主义的统治。
    为了消除目前的经济危机，印度尼西亚共产党已经制定了一个纲领，并且已把它提交给政府。纲领中有一项是：要求政府一定拒绝接受美国强行加于印度尼西亚的贸易限制。
    艾地说：印度尼西亚共产党不倦地努力争取与各民主党派进行合作；他号召各政党、团体、派别和每个有善良意志的人加强民族的团结，使印度尼西亚共和国能战胜“回教国运动”这一恐怖组织，并克服日益感觉到的经济危机。
