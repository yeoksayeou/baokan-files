The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 44, 1953, has been published.

This issue contains the resolutions recently adopted at the Third World Trade Union Congress held in Vienna, and publishes an editorial entitled "Strengthen the Domestic and International Unity of the Working People." The editorial points out: The Third World Trade Union Congress is a congress of representatives of working people from various countries with unprecedentedly broad representation in the history of the labor movement. The great significance of this conference lies in the fact that the delegates attending the conference represented 88.6 million organized workers of different races and nationalities, different political views and religious beliefs. They jointly formulated and adopted a broad program of struggle in a truly democratic manner. The conference declared that the domestic and international unity of the working class and the concerted action of all working people are the main means and methods for realizing this program. The resolutions of the conference reflect the improvement of work awareness. The labor movement has gradually moved away from the narrow scope of local struggles for partial demands. Hundreds of millions of working people have realized that the struggle to satisfy their own demands is inextricably linked with the struggle for democratic freedom, national independence and peace. This understanding can become the basis for the working class to unite with all working people and the middle class in a national united front. The editorial concludes: The congress has opened up a new stage of development in the struggle of the working class. The working people of the capitalist world are increasingly aware of the need to take concerted action. The current goal is to build such unity in all trade union organizations, enterprises, cities, villages, and throughout the world.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Struggle for a Policy Change Expected and Certain to be Realized by the French People" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; "Adenauer is Following Hitler's Old Path" by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party; and "New School Year of Party Education in Poland" by A. Starewicz, Minister of Propaganda and Agitation of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

Thorez's article is his speech at the closing session of the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session in October this year. Thorez described the French workers' strike movement in August this year and the recent peasant movement, opposing the French ruling group's actions that lead the people to bankruptcy and war. He pointed out: "The status quo must be changed!" This is the unanimous demand of the French people. They have personally tasted the suffering brought about by the "Marshall Plan" and the Atlantic Treaty, and realized that the Communist Party is correct. The Communist Party initially exposed this policy that violates national interests and fought against it. Thorez said: A change of policy is expected by the French people and will certainly be realized.

Wilhelm Pieck's article criticized the policy program recently issued by the Adenauer puppet government in West Germany. In this program, Adenauer put forward two "most urgent tasks": to make Germany fully join the "European Defense Community" and to completely destroy Marxism. The article also listed the facts that the Adenauer regime implemented a policy of terror to persecute German Communists and release Nazi war criminals. The article pointed out: The program put forward by Adenauer is roughly the same as Hitler's program in the past. There is no doubt that Adenauer and his regime will also break their necks like Hitler. However, the German people and the people of neighboring countries must not underestimate the danger caused by the Bonn revanchist politicians and militarists' regime because of this confidence.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第四十四期中文版已经出版。
    本期刊载了最近在维也纳举行的世界工会第三次代表大会所通过的各项决议，并以“加强劳动人民的国内和国际团结”为题发表社论。社论指出：世界工会第三次代表大会，是工人运动史上具有空前广泛代表性的各国劳动人民代表大会。这次大会的重大意义在于出席大会的代表们，代表着不同种族和国籍、不同政治见解和宗教信仰的八千八百六十万有组织的工人。他们用真正民主的方式共同制订并通过了广泛的斗争纲领。大会宣布，工人阶级的国内和国际团结以及全体劳动人民的一致行动，是实现这个纲领的主要手段和方法。大会的决议反映出工作觉悟的提高。工人运动已渐渐脱离争取局部要求的地方性斗争的狭隘范围。亿万劳动人民已认识到，争取满足切身要求的斗争，和争取民主自由、民族独立与和平的斗争有不可分的联系。这种认识可以成为工人阶级同全体劳动人民，同中间阶层团结在民族统一阵线中的基础。社论最后说：代表大会开辟了工人阶级斗争的新的发展阶段。资本主义世界的劳动人民越来越觉悟到有必要采取一致行动。当前的目标就是在所有的工会组织、企业、城市、乡村以及全世界都建立起这种团结。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士的“为法国人民所期待的并一定能实现的政策改变而斗争”，德国统一社会党中央委员会主席威廉·皮克的“阿登纳走着希特勒的老路”，波兰统一工人党中央宣传鼓动部部长阿·斯塔列维奇的“波兰党内教育新学年”。
    多列士的文章是他在今年十月法共中央全会闭幕会上的讲话。多列士叙述了今年八月法国工人罢工运动和最近的农民运动，反对法国统治集团把人民引向破产和战争的情况。他指出：“必须改变现状！”这是法国人民群众的一致要求。他们已经亲身尝到了“马歇尔计划”和大西洋公约所带来的苦难，认识到共产党是正确的，共产党在最初就揭穿了这种违反民族利益的政策，而且为反对这种政策而斗争。多列士说：改变政策是法国人民所期待的而且是一定能够实现的。
    威廉·皮克的文章抨击了最近西德阿登纳傀儡政府发表的施政纲领。在这个纲领里，阿登纳提出了使德国彻底加入“欧洲防务集团”和彻底摧毁马克思主义的两个“最迫切任务”。文章并列举出阿登纳政权实行恐怖政策迫害德国共产党人和释放纳粹战犯的事实。文章指出：阿登纳所提出的纲领和从前希特勒的纲领是大致相同的。毫无疑问，阿登纳及其政权也像希特勒一样要跌断颈子的。但是，德国人民及其毗邻各国人民绝不能由于这种信心而轻视波恩复仇主义政客和军国主义者的政权所引起的危险。　（新华社）
