    Disaster Does Not Reduce Production
    ——Seeing the Superiority of Being Organized from the Li Tianshu Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Jin Yi
    The land in Tielou Township, Mengjin County, Henan, is a barren loess slope. This autumn, continuous rain affected the growth of local crops, generally reducing production. However, the Li Tianshu Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest: thirty mu of corn yielded an average of 310 jin per mu, an increase of 73 percent over last year and 60 percent higher than that of farmers outside the cooperative; thirty-six mu of millet yielded an average of 230 jin per mu, an increase of 26 percent over last year and 33 percent higher than that of farmers outside the cooperative; other crops such as black beans and mung beans also had full grains. This outstanding fact has aroused the amazement of farmers in nearby villages.

    The reasons for the autumn harvest of the Li Tianshu Agricultural Production Cooperative, in addition to improving farming techniques, implementing reasonable close planting, and rational fertilization, are mainly due to the unique advantages of being organized.

    At the end of May, just as wheat was being harvested, there was a half-soaking rain. If we could seize this timely rain and plant the autumn seedlings one day earlier, we could lay a good foundation for the autumn harvest. However, individual farmers are all "one team," and they cannot manage planting while harvesting. Only the Li Tianshu Agricultural Production Cooperative has the conditions to take into account both harvesting and planting. They allocated labor overnight: all the women were responsible for harvesting, ten male laborers were responsible for threshing, and six laborers and seven livestock were put into rush planting. In this way, harvesting and planting were carried out simultaneously, and within five days, sixty-six mu of stubble land were planted with autumn seedlings. Later, the weather became increasingly dry, but the cooperative still had a lot of land to plant, so they reallocated labor for the second time. Except for eight old men who were cleaning up the final threshing work, all the cooperative members were put into drought resistance and planting. Young men carried water, young women lifted water, and middle-aged women dug holes to apply fertilizer and drop seeds. From dawn to dark, the busy crowd fought on the half-mile-long hillside. The cooperative's summer sowing task was basically completed, but the surrounding people were still busy threshing. Although the Liu Pinshan mutual aid group was better organized, because the land was not managed uniformly and the labor force could not be rationally distributed, this family had to take care of their own threshing, and that family had to hurry up and harvest their late wheat; the planting was interrupted in less than two days. People clearly saw that on that vast slope, only the cooperative's land was sown early and well.

    It was not until late June that a heavy rain finally fell. At this time, the masses outside the cooperative began to rush to plant, while the cooperative's late autumn crops had grown five or six inches high. This rain brought complicated field work: dry land was eager to be plowed, otherwise it would become hardened, and the soil could not be differentiated and moisture accumulated during the hot days; various early autumn crops competed with weeds; millet needed to be weeded; cotton was about to bloom and urgently needed "leg stripping"; aphids spread rapidly and needed to be eliminated urgently; sweet potato vines grew false roots and needed to be turned over and dried... Chen Tiechui, a single-handed farmer, was recognized as the household with the best production conditions: two cows, one horse, and five laborers. However, he could only manage to seize the moisture to rush to plant; the weeds in the sweet potato field grew higher than the seedlings, and no one weeded them; the vines were full of false roots, and no one turned them over; the young millet was five or six inches high, and no one weeded it; the livestock only cared about sending manure and pulling the plow and could not plow the dry land. After the rush planting was completed, the land was also dry, and most of the early autumn crops were barren. It was not until half a month later that Chen Tiechui took advantage of the second moisture to weed and thin out the seedlings; but at this time, the cooperative's late corn and late millet had already covered the ground with green. During this period, the cooperative further rationally organized its labor force and calmly did all the work neatly. Six elderly people who worked carefully and knew technology went to the cotton fields to "strip legs"; four young people and twelve women took advantage of the strong heat of the sun in the morning and morning to control insects and weed millet seedlings respectively, and in the afternoon, they took advantage of the quick arrival of dew to turn to replanting seedlings together; five half-laborers turned sweet potato seedlings, and sixteen strong men turned wheat stubble (which was not plowed during rush planting); the people in the farming group plowed dry land in the morning and afternoon, and also put into turning wheat stubble in the morning while feeding cattle. All urgent heavy work was completed in three days. They immediately turned to weeding early autumn, and the weeds in the ninety mu of early autumn land were wiped out in less than two days. When people saw it, they were convinced and said: "The cooperative is still good, and there is not a single weed in their fields."

   After "Little Heat," continuous rain began, clearing for half a day and raining for half a day, dripping for more than ten days. Each sorghum plant grew four or five extra stalks, seriously affecting the growth of the main seedlings; cotton was covered with wild branches and extra buds; sweet potato vines covered the ground, and false roots grew everywhere; the dry land and late autumn land were full of dense weeds; corn was about to "tip," and topdressing could not be delayed. As soon as the sky cleared, the work was crowded into a lump, and even the cooperative felt that it could not "pull the bolt." The old people said to trim the branches first, and the young people said to weed the land first. The common argument was that if they could not take care of it, they would give up weeding the dry land and applying topdressing. However, at the members' meeting, the director reminded everyone: "Giving up any of these tasks will reduce production. As long as we make full and rational use of our labor force, there is no work that cannot be done." After discussion, everyone decided to complete the important tasks first: applying topdressing, weeding millet, beating crazy branches, and beating extra stalks, and put the other tasks in second place. All the members launched a labor competition according to the assigned groups. The first urgent task was almost completely completed in a day and a half. All the labor force immediately turned to weeding dry land and turning sweet potato seedlings separately, and in two days, they completed these tasks. The seedlings grew vigorously with the moisture, becoming stronger day by day. The Liu Pinshan mutual aid group, which was known as the banner of the whole township, completed the urgent tasks three or four days later than the cooperative. Other farmers were busy only with thinning late millet seedlings, cotton pruning and beating, and sweet potato turning; the weeds in the dry land were generally not weeded, and the weeds in the autumn land were sometimes deeper than the seedlings, and almost no topdressing was applied. Zhang Zhenghe, a middle peasant, prepared more than twenty carts of manure, but by the time he had free hands, he could no longer enter the field. The cooperative's late millet had already headed, and the farmers outside the cooperative were just beginning to weed the seedlings; the cooperative's corn was sunning its tassels, and the farmers outside the cooperative's was only a foot long. The two distinct contrasts made the farmers in nearby villages very envious of the cooperative: "Turning into a cooperative, not only have people become more diligent, but the land has also become better." "This year, we will only see the cooperative's bumper harvest, and next year we will organize ourselves well and learn from the cooperative."

    In autumn, the climate was not good, and before a burst of busy work was completed, there were several consecutive days of rain. There were more and more weeds in the fields, the cotton crazy branches had become racks, the corn gray bags were as big as fists, weeding and composting were urgently needed... At this time of "three critical hurdles," the generally unorganized farmers, on the contrary, took a customary rest because it was the "hoe hanging" period. Some relaxed and went to fairs and visited relatives, and some changed hands to engage in side businesses. In the mutual aid group, some did their own things, and some also went to engage in side businesses. It was at this time that the cooperative, through ideological education to increase grain production, criticized the idea of "taking a break," established a reward system, and mobilized all the labor force. Li Baodou's mother, who was more than seventy years old, also went to the field to find work to do. Ten strong men transported soil and dug manure pits, and all other laborers, whether working in corn fields, sweet potato fields, or cotton fields, had to simultaneously pull out all the weeds in the fields to supply fertilizer accumulation. In six days, the entire cooperative pulled more than 30,000 jin of weeds and accumulated more than 150 carts of fertilizer, completing the final stage of autumn field management.

    When the outside farmers' thin and short crops were still green and yellow, the cooperative had already started the autumn harvest: the corn was bearing thick and full ears; the millet with very large ears was neat and uniform, shining with bright golden light. As soon as the members of the North Land Harvesting Group got a new harvest record, they rushed to the South Land Group to report the good news: "We harvested 2,492 (gross weight) jin from our three mu and three points." The South Land Group then said: "We also harvested 2,203 from our three mu and two points." The old members trembled with wrinkles on their faces and smiled with their mouths pursed. The young members sang and jumped, and the whole cooperative showed an unusual jubilation for this harvest. People who came to visit from far and near almost unanimously praised: "No wonder the cooperative has a bumper harvest, look how carefully and timely they organize their work!"

    受灾不减产
    ——从李天树农业生产合作社看组织起来的优越性
    金宜
    河南孟津县铁楼乡的土地，是一片瘠薄的黄土坡地。今年秋季阴雨连绵，当地庄稼的生长受到了影响，一般都减产。但是，李天树农业生产合作社却获得了空前的丰收：三十亩玉米每亩平均收三百一十斤，比去年增产百分之七十三，比社外农民高出百分之六十；三十六亩谷子每亩平均收二百三十斤，比去年增产百分之二十六，比社外农民高出百分之三十三；其它如黑豆、绿豆也是籽粒饱满。这一突出的事实，引起了附近各村农民的惊奇。
    李天树农业生产合作社秋季丰收的原因，除了改进耕作技术、实行合理密植、合理施肥以外，主要是因为发挥了组织起来特有的优越性。
    五月底，正当收割小麦的时候，下了一场半透墒雨。如果能够抓住这场时雨，早一天安下秋苗，就能给秋季丰收打下良好基础。但是，个体农民都是“一套人马”，顾了收，就管不了种。只有李天树农业生产合作社有条件收、种兼顾。他们连夜调配了劳力：全部妇女包下收割，十个男劳力负责打场，抽出六个劳力和七个牲畜投入抢种。这样，边收边种，五天之内，六十六亩茬地都安下了秋苗。以后，天越来越干旱，但是社里还有许多地要种，于是又二次调配了劳力，除由八个老汉收拾煞尾的场活以外，全社社员一起投入抗旱点种。青年、壮年的男子担水，青年妇女抬水，壮年妇女刨窝点粪，小孩丢籽。从黎明到天黑，忙碌的人群，一直战斗在半里长的漫山坡上。社里夏播任务基本完成了，周围的群众却还忙着打场。刘品三互助组虽然组织得比较好一些，但由于土地不是统一经营、劳力不能合理分配，这家要顾自己打场，那家要赶紧收割自己的晚麦；点种不两天就中断了。人们清楚地看到：在那广阔的坡地上，只有合作社的土地又早又好地播种了。
    好容易到六月下旬才下一场大雨。这时社外群众开始抢种，而社里的晚秋作物已长五、六寸高了。这场雨带来了繁杂的田活：旱地急于要犁，晚了就要结板，就不能在伏天分化土壤、积蓄水分；各种早秋作物苗草争长；谷子要薅苗；棉花将要开花，急需“脱裤腿”；蚜虫迅速蔓延，急需消灭；红薯秧生了虚根，急需翻晒……。单干农民陈铁锤是公认为生产条件最好的户：两头牛、一匹马，五个劳力。但是他也只能顾住趁墒抢种；红薯地里草比苗长得高，没有人锄，秧藤生满虚根，没有人翻，穉谷五、六寸高了也没有人薅，牲口只顾送粪拉耧，没法犁旱地。等抢种完了，地土也干了，大部早秋作物荒芜起来。直到半月以后，陈铁锤才趁二次墒锄草间苗；可是这时社里的晚玉米、晚谷子已经绿油油地盖满了地皮。合作社在这一段时期进一步合理地组织了劳力，从容不迫地把所有的活都做得利利落落。六个老年人干活细、懂技术，就到棉花地“脱裤腿”；四个青年和十二个妇女趁早晨、上午太阳热力强，就分别治虫、薅谷苗，下午趁露墒快来又一起转入补苗；五个半劳力翻红薯秧，十六个壮年翻麦茬（抢种时没犁）；耕作组的人早晨下午犁旱地，上午趁喂牛时也投入翻麦茬。一切急迫的重活，三天内全部结束了。他们紧接着转入锄早秋，九十亩早秋地里的野草，不上两天就被消灭净光。人们一见都口服心服地说：“还是合作社好，人家地里没一棵草。”
   “小暑”以后，连绵的阴雨开始了，晴半晌，雨半晌，一直滴溜十几天。高粱每株长了四、五个赘棵，严重影响主苗的生长；棉花长满狂枝赘芽；红薯秧遮满地皮，遍生虚根；旱地和晚秋地里都是密密的野草；玉米快要冒“梢”，施追肥不能再晚。天一放晴，活挤成了一疙瘩，连合作社也感到“拉不开拴”了。老年人说，先整枝，青年人说，先锄地，共同的主张是，顾不过来，就放弃锄旱地草和施追肥。但是，在社员大会上社长却提醒大家说： “放弃那件活都将减产，只要我们充分合理使用劳力，没有做不完的活。”大家讨论决定：把紧要活：施追肥、锄谷草、打疯枝、打赘棵先作完，其它的活放到第二位。全体社员按照分好的小组，展开了劳动竞赛。第一位的紧急活，一天半差不多全部结束了。所有劳力立即分别转入锄旱地草、翻红薯秧，两天工夫，就把这些活做完了。禾苗趁着墒势蓬勃地上长，一天比一天茁壮。而号称全乡旗帜的刘品三互助组比合作社晚三、四天才做完紧急活。其他农民都只顾忙于剔晚谷苗、棉花整枝打?和红薯翻秧；旱地的草普遍没锄，秋地里的草，有的比苗还深，追肥几乎全部没上。中农张正合倒准备了二十多车粪，但等他腾出手来，已经不能进地了。社里晚谷已经吐穗，社外农民才开始薅苗；社里玉米晒缨了，社外农民的才尺把高。两种鲜明的对比，使得附近各村农民对合作社非常羡慕：“转成合作社，不光人变勤了，地也变好了。”“今年只看社里丰收啦，明年咱也好好组织起来跟社里学。”
    秋天，气候不凑巧，一阵忙活还没做完，接着又是一连几天的阴雨。地里荒草越来越多，棉花疯枝搭成架了，玉米灰包大如拳头，除草沤粪急需开展……。在这“紧要三关”的时候，一般无组织的农民，却反而因为到了“挂锄”期间，照例地休闲起来。他们有的松了劲去赶会、串亲戚，有的改手搞副业。互助组里有的各干各，有的也去搞副业了。就在这个时候，社里通过增产粮食的思想教育，批判了“歇一歇”的思想，建立奖励制度，把全部劳力动员了起来，李宝斗他娘七十多岁了，也下地找活做。十个壮年运土、挖粪坑，其余劳力不论是在玉米地里、红薯地里、棉花地里工作，一律都要同时拔净地里野草，供应积肥。全社六天当中拔草三万多斤，积肥一百五十多车，突击完成了最后一段的秋田管理工作。
    当社外农民又干瘦又矮小的庄稼还是青一块、黄一块的时候，社里已经开始了秋收：玉米结着粗大丰满的棒子；穗头很大的谷子，整齐均匀，耀着亮闪闪的金光。北地收割小组的社员一得到新的收获纪录，就连忙奔向南地小组报喜：“咱们三亩三分收了二千四百九十二（毛重）斤。”南地小组接着说：“咱们三亩二分也收了二千二百三。”老年社员颤动着满脸的皱纹，抿着嘴直笑，青年社员又是歌唱又是跳跃，全社为这一丰收呈现出少有的欢腾。远的、近的来这里参观的人们，几乎异口同声地夸赞道：“难怪合作社丰收哩，看人家组织起来做活多细致、多应时呵！”
