    On Various Posts in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Guaranteeing the Supply of Raw Materials
    "Guaranteeing the supply of raw materials is the greatest way to increase production and practice economy," this is the first regulation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works’ basic construction materials department in the increase production and practice economy campaign. To ensure the completion of this plan, all the materials personnel of the materials department brought their enthusiasm and creativity into play. Especially in solving the problem of difficult materials, they truly achieved "tracing to the root and clarifying the matter, and not relaxing until a conclusion is reached." Each specialized section has compiled an instruction chart for solving difficult materials, arranged a schedule, assigned a person to be responsible, and adopted a proactive approach of "facing the project, facing the warehouse, facing the difficulties" to solve problems in material supply. Through the efforts of all the comrades in the metal section, 40 out of the original 51 kinds of lacking materials were supplied within half a month. Wang Baikuai, a dispatcher of the section, went deep into the construction site to understand the material supply situation, reduced the 103 tons of 6 mm round steel used in the design building, solved the problem of this difficult material, and also avoided material backlog. Purchasing agent Lv Wanlin, in order to supply the urgently needed stainless steel plate for the large-scale rolling mill project, transported the materials from Qiqihar in just five days.
    Increasing Power Generation to Meet the Needs of Various Factories for Increased Production
    The power generation of No. 6 and No. 5 generators used by Xinxiang Power Plant in Henan Province in the past could no longer meet the needs of production. After the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the plant's employees revised the plan for repairing No. 4 generator, organized the promotion of the rapid repair method, organized technical personnel to closely combine with workers, carried out rush repair work in batches, and carried out preparations such as acceptance after repair, test run, and withstand voltage test. On September 20, No. 4 generator was repaired and put into operation two weeks ahead of schedule, supporting the increase production and practice economy campaign of fraternal factories in Xinxiang and Jixian. In the past, factories that could only operate two shifts day and night due to insufficient power now have the possibility of changing to three shifts.
    Improving Raw Cotton Supply to Support Textile Mills' Increased Production
    The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is improving the supply of raw cotton to actively support the production of state-owned and private yarn mills in Tianjin.
    This year, new cotton in Shanxi and Hebei provinces came on the market later, and the supply of coarse velvet cotton needed by the factories could not keep up. With the approval of the head office, the raw cotton section of the station contacted the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and transferred thousands of dan of coarse velvet cotton. In order to ensure that various grades of raw cotton can be supplied to meet the needs of production in a balanced manner, the staff of the station strengthened contact with various cotton-producing areas, understood the output and quality of cotton, and understood the specifications and grades of raw cotton to be transferred to Tianjin. According to the production needs of each factory in Tianjin, the decision was made as to which region and which specifications and grades should be transferred first or later. In order to keep abreast of the reserve of raw materials and the needs of production in each factory, the station further strengthened contact with the North China Textile Administration Bureau, and processed the raw cotton according to different qualities. For cotton with impurities, the station tried to remove the impurities before supplying it to the yarn mills for production. Those that were not suitable for textile production were processed into cotton batting, or resold to sanitary material factories for processing into absorbent cotton, so as not to affect the quality of yarn and cloth.
    Holding a Stagnant Material Exchange Conference
    Qingdao City held a stagnant material exchange conference on October 10. In order to dispose of the long-term accumulated stagnant materials and unsalable commodities of public and private enterprises in a planned and organized manner, turn them into useful materials, solve some of the current difficulties in production and operation, and further carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, so as to accelerate capital turnover and promote production and expand operation. Representatives of industrial and commercial circles from public and private factories, vendors, merchants, and Shanghai, Tianjin, Xuzhou, Jinan, Yantai, Zibo, Zhangzhou, Weifang and other eight cities, as well as the industrial and commercial circles of Laiyang and Jiaozhou prefectures participated in the conference. The conference conducted transactions based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit and the spirit of quality-based pricing.
    According to the sales plans of various public and private enterprises, the unsalable materials for sale included more than 1,000 kinds of hardware equipment, electrical equipment, chemical equipment, construction equipment, daily necessities, textile reproductions, and cultural and educational supplies. During the conference, the stagnant materials and unsalable commodities of each unit were displayed in sheds for customers to choose from.
    Office Staff Also Participate in the Competition
    Before the start of the increase production and practice economy competition in the State-owned Changchun No. 8 Rubber Factory, the leadership summarized the shortcomings of the past that office staff did not participate in the competition. In the past, the leadership believed that there was nothing for the offices to do, and the problem was not big. They only put forward "clerks should go to the workshops to help the workshop groups record and help the workers calculate detailed accounts," etc. Although the clerks went to the workshops, they did not help the workers solve any problems, so everyone said in the past: "Competition, competition, the offices are outside."
    In this increase production and practice economy competition, each office combined with solving key problems in the factory, researched and discussed, and formulated competition conditions. For example, the production scheduling office found that the shortcomings were that production scheduling was not balanced enough, the handling of semi-finished products was chaotic, and there were still differences in patterns and numbers. Therefore, it was decided to strengthen the management of the scheduling system and implement the production system according to batches and sets. In terms of technical management, it is necessary to further check and revise the revised operating procedures to unify workshop operations. They also proposed that the guaranteed balance rate should reach 98%, and a semi-finished product management system should be established to eliminate differences in patterns and numbers. In the past, the supply and marketing section had the phenomenon of wasting raw materials. This time, it was also decided to establish and strengthen the waste material recovery and raw material delivery inspection system, and implement and formulate the raw material technical conditions management system (including procurement, transportation, and storage). In order to prevent unqualified products from the workshop from flowing into the next process, the technical inspection section also formulated a plan to improve the quality responsibility system.
    Caring for the Health of Employees
    In order to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy competition, the Xuanhua Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an in-depth investigation into the occupational diseases of the workers in the East Mining Department of Longyan Iron Mine in mid-August, found out the reasons, and made some improvements. In order to eliminate mine dust, the mine has made a plan to fully promote water-powered drills by the end of October. In addition, 50 drainage pumps were purchased to strengthen ventilation and drainage management. In order to solve the problem of workers lacking ultraviolet rays, it is planned to buy 30 sun lamps and build a sun lamp bathroom. Secondly, establish a pithead canteen to provide workers with hot meals. Establish a first-aid station at the pithead and strengthen health propaganda and education.
    Cooks Finding Tricks
    Feng Yuyao, a cook in the No. 201 Factory, saw that the workers were finding tricks to increase production and practice economy for the country, and felt that he should also find tricks in his work. But he felt that he was a fireman, and if he burned less coal, the food would not be cooked, and there was no trick to find. Once, he found some leftover vegetable soup from workers in the ditch, so he used it to mix with coal to burn. As a result, the coal burned into a crust in the stove, overcoming the phenomenon of black ash falling down in the past. The amount of coal used can be saved by 300 jin per day, and more than 4 tons per month can be saved. Later, Feng Yuyao was transferred to cook rice. He thought that improving the meals would directly help production. So he actively studied the reasons why the rice was not cooked well in the past, and found that the rice was cooked for too long and the rice soup was poured out. Such rice was not only easy to be raw and rotten, but also lacked nutrition. He changed to a cooking method with more rice and less water, and took out the rice when it was three-ripe, and then steamed it in a steamer, and put the rice soup into the steamer. The rice made in this way was both good and nutritious. Worker Wan Shifa said: "The rice tastes really good in the mouth now. I have to eat a few bowls even without dishes."
    Managing Household Affairs Well Without Delaying Her Husband's Work
    Sun Yumei is the wife of Wang Yuqi, a painter at the No. 652 Factory. She is the leader of the tenth embroidery group of street women. Not only does she lead the embroidery group with achievements, but she also has a very planned family life. She gets up very early every day to cook, for fear of delaying her husband's work and her children's schooling. Her home is far from the factory, so she saved the money she saved in her daily life and bought Wang Yuqi a bicycle in August this year. Her husband happily rides his new bicycle to work every day, and his work mood is even higher. After the launch of the factory's increase production and practice economy competition, Wang Yuqi said to Sun Yumei:
  "I thank you for your help. I must actively participate in the increase production and practice economy competition." He made a personal plan: to ensure the quality of the project, implement assembly line operations, save materials, not waste a drop of oil, and use half as much sandpaper as in the past. Sun Yumei also made a plan to ensure that no rice or firewood is wasted, so that her husband can eat well, and to educate her children well, so that Wang Yuqi can work outside with peace of mind.

    在增产节约的各个岗位上
    保证原材料的供应
    “保证原材料供应就是最大的增产节约”，这是鞍钢基本建设材料处增产节约的第一项规定。为了保证完成这项计划，材料处的全体材料人员，发挥了积极性与创造性。特别是在解决困难材料的时候，真正做到了“追根问底要查清，不下结论不放松”。各专业科编制了解决困难材料的指示图表，排出进度，专人负责，采取了“面向工程，面向仓库，面向困难”的主动办法，来解决材料供应方面的问题。金属科经全科同志的努力，原缺乏五十一种材料，在半个月内就设法供应了四十种。该科调拨员王百魁，深入工地了解工地材料供应情况，削减了设计大楼用的一百零三吨六粍的元钢，解决了这项困难材料，也避免了材料的积压。采购员律万林，为了供应大型轧钢工程急需的不锈钢板，仅五天时间，就从齐齐哈尔把材料运了回来。
    增加发电量满足各厂增产需要
    河南新乡电厂过去用的六号机和五号机的发电量，已逐渐不能满足生产的需要了，增产节约运动开展后，该厂职工重新修订了修复四号机的计划，组织推广快速检修法，组织技术人员密切和工人结合，分批进行抢修工作，并且进行了检修后的验收、试车、耐压试验等准备工作。九月二十日，四号机提前两星期修复完毕并且开始送电了，它支援了新乡、汲县各兄弟工厂的增产节约运动。过去由于电力不足，昼夜只能开两班生产的工厂，现在已有可能改为三班生产了。
    改进原棉供应支持纺织厂增产
    中国花纱布公司天津采购供应站，改善原棉供应工作，积极支持天津市国营和私营纱厂的生产。
    今年山西、河北两省的新棉上市较晚，工厂需要的粗绒棉花供应不上，该站原棉科经总公司批准，与中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站联系，调来了数千担粗绒棉花。该站职工为使各种等级的原棉能够均衡地供应生产的需要，加强与各产棉区联系，了解棉花的产量、质量，了解准备调往天津原棉的规格、等级，按照天津各厂生产需要情况，决定哪个地区、哪些规格等级的先调或后调。为了随时掌握各厂原料的储备情况，和生产需要的情况，与华北纺织管理局进一步加强了联系，并根据不同质量的原棉分别加以处理，对于带有杂质的棉花，该站设法把杂质去掉再供给纱厂生产，不适于纺织用的就加工弹成絮棉，或转卖给卫生材料厂加工脱脂棉，免得影响纱布的质量。
    召开呆滞物资交流大会
    青岛市在十月十日举行呆滞物资交流大会，为了有计划、有组织地处理公、私营企业长期积压下来的呆滞材料和滞销商品，使它们变成有用的物资，解决当前在生产上和经营上的一些困难问题，进一步开展增产节约运动，以达到加速资金周转，推动生产与扩大经营。该市各公私厂商、摊商、行商和上海、天津、徐州、济南、烟台、淄博、张周、潍坊等八市，及莱阳、胶州两专区的工商界代表都来参加这次大会。大会本着互助互利的原则和以质论价的精神，进行交易。
    根据各公私营企业的销售计划，销售的滞销物资包括五金器材、电工器材、化工器材、建筑器材、日用百货、纺织复制品、文教用品等一千多种。大会期间，各单位的呆滞材料和滞销商品设棚陈列，让顾客们选购。
    科室人员也参加竞赛
    国营长春第八橡胶厂增产节约竞赛未开始以前，领导上总结了过去科室人员不参加竞赛的缺点。过去领导上认为科室没啥搞的，问题不大，只提出了“职员要下车间，帮助车间小组记录，帮助工人算细账”等，职员们虽然下了车间，并没帮助工人解决什么问题，所以过去大家都说：“竞赛竞赛，科室在外。”
    这次开展增产节约竞赛中，各科室都结合解决厂内关键问题，研究讨论，订出了竞赛条件。如生产调度室，找出缺点是生产调度不够均衡，处理半成品混乱，还存在差纹差号现象。于是决定加强调度制度的管理，贯彻按批按套生产制度。在技术管理上，要进一步检查修订后的操作规程，使车间操作统一。他们更提出保证均衡率要达到百分之九十八，并建立半成品管理制度，消灭差纹差号现象。供销科过去存在着原材料浪费现象，这次也决定建立和加强余料回收与原材料交付检验制度，贯彻和制订原材料技术条件管理制度（包括采购、运输、保管）。为了使车间不合格品不能流入下道工序，技术检查科也订出计划，健全质量责任制度。
    关怀职工的身体健康
    中共宣化市委为了保证增产节约竞赛的顺利开展，在八月中旬深入调查了龙烟铁矿东采矿部工人的职业病的情况，找出了原因，已作了一些改进。为了消除矿尘，该矿已作出在十月底全面推广水式风钻的计划。另外购买五十部排水机，加强通风排水管理。为了解决工人缺乏紫外线的问题，计划买三十个太阳灯，建立太阳灯浴室。其次，建立坑口食堂，供给工人吃热饭。在坑口建立急救站，并加强卫生宣传教育工作。
    炊事员找窍门
    二○一厂炊事员冯宇耀看到工人找窍门给国家增产节约，觉得自己也应该在工作上找窍门。但是他又觉得自己是一个烧火的工人，把煤少烧一点吧，饭菜又煮不熟，没有什么窍门可找。有一次他发现沟内有工人吃剩下的一些残菜残汤，他就用它来拌合煤烧，结果煤在炉内烧成了巴，克服了过去黑灰往下垮的现象。使用煤量每日可省三百斤，每月可节省四吨多。后来冯宇耀又调来烧饭了，他想到搞好了伙食，也就是直接帮助了生产。所以他就积极研究过去饭煮不好的原因，发现过去的饭煮得过久，又把米汤都泼掉了，这样的饭不但容易生、烂，而且没有营养。他就改为米多水少的煮法，把饭煮到三成熟就掏起来，再上蒸笼蒸，把米汤下到蒸笼内。这样做出来的饭又好又有营养，工人万世发说：“现在的饭吃在口里真有味道，没有菜我也要吃几碗。”
    管好家务，不耽误丈夫上班
    孙玉梅是六五二厂油工王玉起的爱人，她担任街道妇女刺绣十组的组长，她不但领导刺绣组有成绩，就是在家庭生活方面也很有计划。她每天很早的起来做饭，怕耽误丈夫上班和孩子上学。她家离工厂很远，她就把在平日生活中节省下来的钱积起来，今年八月份给王玉起买了一辆自行车，她丈夫每天愉快地骑着新车子上班，工作情绪更高了。厂里增产节约竞赛展开以后，王玉起对孙玉梅说：
  “我感谢你对我的帮助，我一定要积极参加增产节约竞赛。”他订了个人计划：保证工程质量，实行流水作业，节省材料，不浪费一滴油，使用砂纸要比过去节省一半。孙玉梅也订了计划，保证不浪费米和柴，使丈夫吃得好，要好好教育孩子，使王玉起安心在外工作。
