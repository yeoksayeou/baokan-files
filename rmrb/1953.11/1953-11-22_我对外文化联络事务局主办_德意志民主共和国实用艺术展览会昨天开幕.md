    Also attending the opening ceremony were Mr. Koenig, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China, Dr. Harrich, Director of the Higher Education Department of the German Democratic Republic and representatives Althoffman, representatives of the German side negotiation team for the 1954 implementation plan of the Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement, and art experts Liedtke and Brandt, specially sent by the Berlin Academy of Applied Arts of the German Democratic Republic to China to assist in the preparation of this exhibition.
    At the opening ceremony, Lin Li Ru first gave a speech, saying that this exhibition systematically introduces the rich heritage of national culture inherited by the German working people in the field of art, and the new realistic applied art that they have carried forward and developed today based on excellent traditions. Such an exhibition is the first of its kind in New China. This marks the further development and consolidation of the friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and German people. The items displayed in this exhibition include bronzes, ironware, tinware, pottery, porcelain, glass, precious metals, woodware, textiles, toys, books, and leather products. Whether they are historical relics from the Middle Ages or modern applied art creations, they are all the crystallization of the wisdom of the German working people. The people of our country will recognize how the German people inherit and carry forward their excellent national heritage through these exhibits, and will further promote our understanding of the German people.
    Ambassador Koenig then delivered a speech, saying that the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition held in Beijing and Shanghai a few months ago was of great help in consolidating the fraternal friendship between the people of the two countries. Today, this exhibition in China will make a greater contribution to further strengthening our close and unbreakable friendship. The items in this exhibition represent different periods of German history—from the 16th century to the 1870s or so, as well as modern items. He also said: There are extremely precious original works among the exhibits, which have been collected from all corners of the German Democratic Republic after a long period of searching, specifically for this exhibition in China. He hopes that Chinese friends will see a new content of our close and profound friendship in this exhibition.
    After the ceremony, the guests visited the exhibition.
    The exhibition displays more than 900 pieces of practical art such as ironware, bronzes, tinware, porcelain, pottery, glass, toys and leather goods.

    【新华社二十一日讯】根据中德文化合作协定一九五三年执行计划，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局主办的“德意志民主共和国实用艺术展览会”二十一日在北京中山公园水榭举行揭幕仪式。参加揭幕仪式的有：中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡，教育部副部长林砺儒，中国科学院副院长竺可桢，文化部办公厅主任赵沨，对外文化联络事务局副局长陈忠经，外交部苏联东欧司专员刘靖宇、交际处副处长王拓，和中国美术家协会副主席江丰、蔡若虹，以及美术家华君武、吴作人、王朝闻、张汀、于非暗、张光宇等。
    参加揭幕仪式的还有德意志民主共和国驻我国大使柯尼希以及各国驻华外交使节和使馆人员，中德文化合作协定一九五四年执行计划德方谈判代表团代表德意志民主共和国高等教育署署长哈里希博士及阿尔特霍夫曼两代表和德意志民主共和国柏林实用艺术学院特派来我国协助筹备这次展览会的艺术专家李达克和伯朗特。
    揭幕仪式上林砺儒首先致词说，这个展览会系统地介绍了德国劳动人民在艺术方面所继承的民族文化的丰富遗产，和他们今天根据优秀的传统而发扬光大的新现实主义的实用艺术，像这样的展览会在新中国还是第一次。这标志着中德两国人民的友谊和文化交流已获得了进一步的发展和巩固。在这个展览会里所陈列的物品有铜器、铁器、锡器、陶器、瓷器、玻璃、贵重金属、木器、纺织品、玩具、书籍以及皮革制品等，这些不论是中世纪的历史文物，或者是现代的实用艺术创作，都是德国劳动人民智慧的结晶。我国人民将通过这些展览品认识到德国人民如何承继和发扬他们的民族优秀遗产，并将进一步促进我们对德国人民的了解。
    柯尼希大使接着致词说，几个月以前在北京和上海举行的德意志民主共和国工业展览会，对于巩固两国人民之间的兄弟友好关系有着很大的帮助，今天这个展览会在中国展出，对进一步加强我们亲密和牢不可破的友谊将有更大的贡献。这个展览会上的物品是代表德国历史的各个不同的时期——从十六世纪到十九世纪的七十年代左右，也有现代时期的物品。他又说：展览品中有极为珍贵的原作，这些都是为在中国举行这次展览会而从德意志民主共和国各个角落，经过长期搜罗搜集来的。希望中国的朋友们将在这个展览会中看到我们亲密和深厚友谊的一个新的内容。
    仪式完毕后来宾们参观了展览会。
