To Implement the General Line, Develop Mutual Aid and Cooperation
    Wu Jiang

    We already know that the General Line is the route to gradually transition to socialism. How does agriculture transition to socialism? The most fundamental method is to develop mutual aid and cooperation, gradually uniting the small-scale, scattered operations of individual households into collective large-scale production capable of adopting advanced technologies, and gradually transforming the individual land ownership of farmers into collective land ownership, based on the voluntary participation of farmers. Only in this way can we produce enough grain, cotton, and other agricultural products for the state and the farmers themselves. Only in this way can everyone become prosperous together. Many farmers have already begun to walk this path, some for several years. Some people think that implementing socialism means that one day the government will issue an order or a notice, announcing that everything will be nationalized. But socialism is not done that way. The road to socialism is taken step by step, and mutual aid and cooperation is the path to socialism. Now the state's General Line shines a brighter light on this path, and farmers should walk this road even more actively than in the past.

    The Road of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Can Be Divided into Three Stages

    To walk the road of mutual aid and cooperation, one must first know what this road looks like. The road of mutual aid and cooperation can be roughly divided into three major stages: first, establish mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts; then, establish agricultural producers' cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature; and then develop to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives of a completely socialist nature (i.e., collective farms).

    Mutual aid teams are stronger than individual households. In mutual aid teams, although the means of production (land, farm tools, etc.) are privately owned, the collective labor makes the team more powerful than individual households. Things that individual households cannot do or do well can be done or done well by mutual aid teams. Agricultural producers' cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature are a further step beyond mutual aid teams. These cooperatives pool individually owned land and important farm tools and livestock as shares, which are then managed and used uniformly by the cooperative. The cooperative has more public property, work can be divided according to each person's expertise, and the grain and other agricultural products harvested are distributed reasonably based on labor and land. Newer technologies can be adopted. The strength of these cooperatives is greater than that of mutual aid teams, and things that mutual aid teams cannot do or do well can be done or done well by these cooperatives.

    Agricultural producers' cooperatives of a completely socialist nature (collective farms) are, of course, a big step beyond agricultural producers' cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature. In these cooperatives, the means of production (land, important farm tools, draft animals, etc.) are owned collectively by all members of the cooperative, while the means of subsistence (housing, furniture, poultry, individually distributed agricultural products, savings deposits, etc.) and small plots of land beside the houses, small farm tools, etc., are owned by individual members. Because these cooperatives have complete public ownership (referring to the means of production, not the means of subsistence), the members are more united and can use tractors and other agricultural machinery. Therefore, the production capacity of these cooperatives is much greater than that of the cooperatives mentioned earlier. The products produced by the cooperative, after paying state taxes, retaining public accumulation funds for the cooperative, and running local public welfare undertakings, are all distributed to the various members, who live their own lives separately and do not "eat from a common pot." As a result, all farmers live very prosperous lives, with no poor people. Whoever labors best receives the most income, and whoever lives the best life; the lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak can also be taken care of. Soviet farmers have universally established this type of cooperative. A few places in our country are currently experimenting with them, such as the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province. After only three years of experimentation, last year the farm averaged 11,000 catties of rice per hectare (equivalent to fifteen mu), which is four to five thousand catties higher than the average farmer's yield per hectare. This year, this farm will sell 1.62 million catties of rice to the state. When our country's farmers universally establish this type of agricultural producers' cooperative in the future, it will be the realization of socialism in the countryside. It is now necessary to vigorously develop agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    In recent years, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has greatly developed in rural areas across the country. According to a survey last year, there were already more than 8.3 million temporary mutual aid teams and permanent mutual aid teams nationwide, and more than 3,600 agricultural producers' cooperatives were being piloted. According to a survey in October of this year, more than 47 million households of farmers across the country have participated in temporary mutual aid teams, permanent mutual aid teams, and agricultural producers' cooperatives. The number of agricultural producers' cooperatives has increased to more than 14,000. In terms of strength, increased production, and direction, agricultural producers' cooperatives are becoming increasingly important. Last year, according to calculations from eight counties in Shanxi Province, including Qinyuan, Lucheng, and Zuoquan, the average yield per mu was roughly half again as high in mutual aid teams as in individual households, and half again as high in cooperatives as in mutual aid teams, which is more than double that of individual households. With cooperatives increasing production, the income of members also increased. This year, according to calculations from 47 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Qin County, Shanxi Province, out of 1,000 member households, 970 households saw an increase in income, generally by about three to four shi, with some increasing by as much as fifteen to twenty shi or more; the 30 households that did not see an increase in income were mostly due to a sudden decrease in labor this year. Agricultural producers' cooperatives increase production and the income of members, which greatly helps national construction. There is a village called Heinong in Shahe County, Hebei Province, which had 26 households. It used to be a poor mountain village, with an average of 81 catties of grain harvested per mu, and the farmers lived a life of "bran and vegetables for half a year's grain." Last year, the village established an agricultural producers' cooperative, with an average of 330 catties of raw grain harvested per mu, and every household had surplus grain. This year, this small mountain village will be able to sell 50,000 catties of grain to the state. These are just a few examples; similar examples can be found in all places where agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established.

    From this, it can be seen that, whether for the benefit of the farmers themselves or for the benefit of national industrialization, it is necessary to vigorously develop agricultural producers' cooperatives. If these cooperatives are run well, they can also drive the great development of mutual aid teams. Many farmers see that the products produced by these cooperatives and the income of the members surpass the most skilled individual households and mutual aid teams, and their enthusiasm for taking the socialist road is greatly increased. At the same time, running these cooperatives well will cultivate in farmers the habit of collective production, teach them the skills of managing collective affairs, educate them in collectivism, and raise their political awareness, thus preparing conditions for running completely socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives in the future. Therefore, running these cooperatives now is not a matter of blindly following a "new trend," but is both necessary and possible. Running one more of these cooperatives and running it well is a new victory for farmers on the road to socialism and adds another contribution to national construction. Of course, running these cooperatives requires certain conditions. Generally speaking, running mutual aid teams well is still the foundation for running these cooperatives. But conditions should not be discussed too mechanically. According to the experience of many places, as long as the masses understand the benefits of running these cooperatives, are truly willing to run them themselves, have backbones and activists to lead the way, and are combined with the correct leadership of the Party, these cooperatives can be run and can be run well. During the "rectification of deviations" in some places this spring, some cooperatives that farmers urgently wanted to run and had the conditions to run were also dissolved, which was wrong. In places where land reform was completed earlier and mutual aid teams have a considerable foundation, these cooperatives should of course be run more and should be run well; however, in newly liberated areas where land reform was completed later, as long as favorable conditions are met and the masses are willing to run them, they can also be run, and running them does not necessarily have to be worse than in the former type of area. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives in newly liberated areas may even develop faster than some in older liberated areas.

    Run Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Credit Cooperatives Well

    To enable farmers to take the socialist road, running agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation well is the main thing. In addition, it is also necessary to do three important things well: one is supply and marketing cooperation, one is credit cooperation, and one is mobilizing farmers to sell grain to the state. The matter of selling grain has already been discussed earlier, so I will now discuss the other two.

    Running supply and marketing cooperatives well means blocking the capitalist road in the countryside from the commercial aspect and reducing the polarization of wealth in the countryside. As everyone knows, in the past, speculative merchants took advantage of the difficulties faced by farmers in production and life, using the method of suppressing the purchase price of agricultural products and raising the selling price of goods to profit from the buying and selling, thereby exploiting the farmers. Many capitalists and rich peasants grew fat by sucking the blood of farmers in this way. Now, many speculative merchants are still trying every means to harm farmers. If we do not run supply and marketing cooperatives well, they will become even more unscrupulous. If we run supply and marketing cooperatives well and sign contracts combining agricultural producers' cooperatives or mutual aid teams with supply and marketing cooperatives, we can link farmers with the socialist state-owned economy and link farmers' production with national planning. This will ensure that farmers do not suffer losses, making them more willing to take the socialist road.

    Running credit cooperatives well is to gradually eliminate usury, thereby blocking the capitalist road in the countryside from this aspect. Farmers often have some difficulties in production and life and often have times when they urgently need money. If credit cooperatives are not run, rich peasants will exploit the opportunity to exploit farmers with high interest rates. Last winter, in Gongcun Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, the grain lent out by six rich peasants accounted for half of the total amount of grain lent out in the village, with interest rates all above five percent. These rich peasants who lent out grain got rich, while those farmers who borrowed grain became poor, and class differentiation became more and more serious. Running rural credit cooperatives well and linking them with the state bank can timely solve many of the difficulties faced by farmers in production and life. Those who lend money at high interest rates will have no way to use their schemes, and farmers can better take the socialist road.

    Active Leadership, Steady Progress

    How should the road of mutual aid and cooperation be taken to avoid deviations? To put it simply, it is necessary to have active leadership and steady progress. Not actively leading is letting things take their own course, and not steadily progressing is being impetuous and rash. We must oppose both letting things take their own course and being impetuous and rash.

    Last winter and this spring, there were some hasty and rash phenomena in some places in running cooperatives, which were later corrected; at the same time, the phenomenon of excessive "interference" with farmers was also corrected. These were all necessary. However, this year in some places, mutual aid and cooperation have stopped moving forward, and many cadres dare not promote socialism to farmers and dare not righteously speak of the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation; some places that were not actively running cooperatives in the first place have become even less active.

    Is this right? Of course not. The result of doing so is that some farmers have relaxed their efforts in mutual aid and cooperation, and those who were originally wavering have become even more wavering; some people who have joined the cooperative have also withdrawn, wanting to buy a few mu of good land to work on their own or to do some business; some are also hoarding grain, wanting to speculate. Some rich peasants who originally opposed mutual aid and cooperation, seeing that we do not talk about the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation, have been talking a lot about the disadvantages of mutual aid and cooperation. Farmers' thinking is confused.

    Although this situation is not yet very serious, it is worthy of our vigilance. It must be known that the socialist forces must occupy the positions in the countryside, otherwise the capitalist forces will occupy them; the struggle is constantly going on. To make socialism gradually occupy the positions in the countryside, we can only actively develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the countryside, especially actively run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, so that the socialist forces in the countryside become stronger day by day.

专栏：向农民宣传总路线

    实行总路线要发展互助合作
    吴江
    我们已经知道，总路线就是一步一步过渡到社会主义的路线。农业怎样过渡到社会主义呢？最根本的办法就是发展互助合作，把一家一户分散经营的小生产，一步一步都联合成能够采用先进技术的集体大生产，把农民个人土地所有制、按照农民自愿，一步一步改变成为土地集体所有制。只有这样，才能生产出来国家和农民自己足够用的粮食、棉花和别的农产品。只有这样，才能大家共同富裕。这条道路，许多农民实际上已经开始走了，有的已经走了好几年了。有些人想着：实行社会主义就是到了有一天政府下个命令、出个告示，宣布一切归公。其实社会主义不是那个样子办的。社会主义的路是一步一步走的，互助合作就是走社会主义的路。现在国家的总路线把这条道路照得更亮了，农民应该比过去更加积极地走这条道路。
    互助合作的道路可以分三段走
    要走互助合作的道路，就要先知道这条道路究竟是啥样子。互助合作道路大体上可以分三大段：先办带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组，然后办半社会主义性质的生产合作社，再发展到办完全社会主义性质的生产合作社（就是集体农庄）。
    互助组比单干户强。在互助组里，生产资料（土地、农具等）虽然是私有的，但因为是集体劳动，所以力量比单干户大，单干户有一些办不到或办不好的事，互助组就办得到、办得好。半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社又比互助组进了一步。这种合作社是把个人所有的土地和重要的农具、牲口入了股，归社里统一经营使用，社内有较多的公共财产，做活能按每个人的专长分工，打下粮食和别的农产品按劳动力和土地合理分配，能够采用比较新的技术。这种合作社的力量又要比互助组大，互助组办不到或办不好的事，这种合作社就办得到、办得好。
    完全社会主义性质的生产合作社（集体农庄）当然又比半社会主义性质的生产合作社进了一大步。这种合作社是生产资料（土地和重要的农具、耕畜等）归合作社全体社员公有，生活资料（住宅、家具、家禽、个人分得的农产品和储蓄存款等）和宅子旁边的小块园地、小农具等归社员个人所有。这种合作社因为是完全的公有制（指生产资料，不是指生活资料），社员们就更加齐心了，而且能用拖拉机和其他农业机器。所以，这种合作社的生产能力比前面说的那一种合作社更要大得多了。合作社生产的东西，除缴纳国税、留合作社公积金和办当地的公共福利事业以外，都分配给各个社员所有，各家各户分开过自己的生活，并不是“吃大锅饭”。结果是全体农民都过得很富裕，没有穷人。谁劳动最好，谁的收入就最多，谁的生活就过得最好；孤寡老弱也能得到照顾。苏联农民已经普遍办成了这种合作社。我国少数地方目前也正在试办，如松江省桦川县的星火集体农庄，试办才三年，去年农庄每垧（合十五市亩）水田平均产一万一千斤稻谷，比一般农户每垧水田高出四、五千斤。今年这个农庄要卖给国家的稻谷就有一百六十二万斤。等到将来我国农民普遍办起了这种农业生产合作社，就是在农村中实现了社会主义。现在要大力发展农业生产合作社
    几年来在各地农村中，互助合作运动有很大的发展。据去年的调查，全国已经有了八百三十几万个临时的互助组和常年的互助组，试办了三千六百多个农业生产合作社。照今年十月的调查，全国各地农村参加到临时互助组、常年互助组和农业生产合作社里面的农民，有四千七百多万户。农业生产合作社增加到一万四千多个。论力量，论增产，论方向，目前农业生产合作社越来越显得重要了。去年据山西省沁源、潞城、左权等八个县的计算，每亩地的平均产量，大体上是互助组比单干户高出半倍，合作社又比互助组高出半倍，比单干户就高出了一倍多。合作社增产多了，社员的收入也就增多了。今年据山西省沁县四十七个农业生产合作社的计算，一千户社员，有九百七十户收入增加了，一般都增加了三、四石左右，多的增加到十五石到二十石以上；三十户没有增加收入，多半是因为今年劳动力突然减少了的缘故。农业生产合作社增产多，社员收入多，对于国家建设的帮助也就大。河北省沙河县有个黑碯村，二十六户，过去是个穷山庄，每亩地平均收八十一斤粮食，农民过的是“糠菜半年粮”的生活；去年村里办起农业生产合作社，每亩地平均收到原粮三百三十斤，家家有余粮，今年这个小山庄就能卖给国家五万斤粮食。这不过是随便举几个例子；凡是办了农业生产合作社的地方，都可以找到这样的例子。
    从这里可以看出：不论为农民自己的利益着想，或者为国家工业化的利益着想，都需要大力发展农业生产合作社。这种合作社办好了，还可以带动互助组大发展。许多农民看到这种合作社出产的东西和社员的收入赛过最会经营的单干户和互助组，大家走社会主义道路的劲头就足了。同时，办好这种合作社，农民就会养成集体生产的习惯，学会经管大家务的本领，受到集体主义的教育，提高政治觉悟，这样也就给将来办完全社会主义性质的生产合作社准备了条件。所以，现在办这种合作社并不是勉强赶“时新”，而是既需要办，也可能办的。这种合作社多办一个并且办得好，就是农民在社会主义道路上的一个新的胜利，也是为国家建设多增加一分力量。当然，办这种合作社要有一定的条件，一般地说，办好互助组还是办这种合作社的基础。但讲条件也不能讲得太机械。根据好多地方的经验，只要群众懂得办这种合作社的好处，自己真正愿意办，有骨干和积极分子带头，再加上党的正确领导，这种合作社就可以办，就有可能办好。今年春季有些地方“纠偏”的时候，把一些农民自己迫切要求办而且有条件办成的合作社也解散了，这是错误的。这种合作社在土地改革完成得较早、互助组有相当基础的地方，当然应该多办、应该办好；可是在土地改革完成得较迟的新解放区，只要具备有利的条件，群众愿意办也同样可以办，而且办起来也不一定就比前一种地区差，有些新解放区的农业生产合作社甚至可以比某些老解放区发展得快。
    办好供销合作和信贷合作
    要使农民走社会主义的路，办好农业生产的互助合作是主要的，另外还要办好三件重要的事情：一件是供销合作，一件是信贷合作，一件是动员农民把粮食卖给国家。卖粮这一件事前边已经讲过了，这里再把另外两件讲一讲。
    办好供销合作，就是要从商业方面把农村的资本主义道路堵死，减少农村的贫富分化。谁都知道，过去投机商人利用农民在生产和生活上的困难，用压价收买农产品、抬价出卖货物的办法，在一买一卖之间，从中取利，来剥削农民，不少资本家和富农就是靠从这方面吸农民的血长肥起来的。现在，许多投机商人还在千方百计坑害农民，我们要是不把供销合作办好，他们就更要为非作歹。我们要是办好了供销合作，订好农业生产合作社或互助组和供销合作社的结合合同，就能把农民和社会主义的国营经济联结起来，就能把农民的生产和国家计划联结起来。这样就能保证农民不吃亏，使农民更愿意走社会主义的路。
    办好信贷合作，就是为了逐渐消灭高利贷，从这方面把农村的资本主义道路堵死。农民在生产上和生活上常常有一些困难，常常有急着用钱的时候，不办信贷合作，富农就会钻空子，用高利盘剥农民。去年冬天，黑龙江省克山县的工农村，六家富农放出的贷粮占全村贷粮总数的一半，利息都在五分以上。这些放粮的富农发了财，那些借粮的农民就受穷了，阶级分化就一天比一天厉害。办好农村的信贷合作，并且和国家银行联系起来，农民在生产和生活上的许多困难就可以及时解决。放高利贷的人就有计没处使了，农民就可以更好地走社会主义的路了。
    要积极领导，稳步前进
    互助合作的道路要怎样走法，才能避免偏向呢？说得简单一点，就是要积极领导，稳步前进。不积极领导就是放任自流，不稳步前进就是急躁冒进。放任自流和急躁冒进这两种偏向我们都要反对。
  去年冬季和今年春季，有些地方办合作社有些急躁冒进现象，后来纠正了；同时也纠正了对农民“干涉”过多的现象。这都是必要的。但是，今年有些地方的互助合作又停着不动了，许多干部不敢对农民宣传社会主义，不敢理直气壮地讲互助合作的好处；有些本来就不积极办合作社的地方就更不积极了。
    这样对不对呢？当然不对。这样做的结果是：有些农民对互助合作松劲了，原来动摇的人更加动摇了；有的人进了社也退出来，想买几亩好地去单干，或者去做点买卖；有的还囤积粮食，想去投机。本来反对互助合作的一些富农，看见我们不讲互助合作的好处，他们就大讲互助合作的坏话。农民的思想混乱了。
    这种情况虽然还不是很严重，却很值得我们警惕。要知道农村中的阵地，社会主义不去占领，资本主义就会去占领；斗争时时刻刻都在进行着。我们要使社会主义一步一步占领农村的阵地，只有在农村中积极发展互助合作运动，特别是要积极办好农业生产合作社，让农村中的社会主义的力量一天天强大起来。
