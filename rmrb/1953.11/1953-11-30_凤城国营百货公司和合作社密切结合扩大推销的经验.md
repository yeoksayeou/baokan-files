    The Fengcheng State-Owned Department Store in Liaodong Province has maintained a good cooperative relationship with cooperatives over the past few years. As a result, the proportion of goods sold through cooperatives has increased year by year. In 1951, it accounted for 60.5% of the total sales value, in 1952 it accounted for 65.64%, and in the first half of 1953 it had increased to 67.7%. The total value of goods purchased by cooperatives from the Fengcheng State-Owned Department Store for sale, taking 1950 as 100, was 195 in 1951, 434 in 1952, and 344.8 in the first half of 1953, equivalent to 149% of the same period in 1952. The full cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperatives has consolidated and expanded the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market, and has also promoted the development of cooperative business.

    The Party committee's emphasis on and strengthening of leadership over commercial work is the main reason why the Fengcheng Department Store and cooperatives have achieved the above results. Since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements last year, the Fengcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has emphasized the ideological and political leadership of commercial work. Starting this year, a commercial group was established under the Fengcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and political deputies were assigned to state-owned trading companies and grassroots cooperatives. Members of the County Committee were also appointed as directors of the County Cooperative Union, which prepared the conditions for strengthening and improving commercial work. In actual work, in addition to regularly convening the heads of state-owned trading companies to report on work, the County Committee also regularly conducts in-depth inspections to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, after the County Committee reversed the erroneous practice of state-owned trading companies being afraid to boldly purchase goods in the second quarter of this year, it found that cooperatives also generally had the phenomenon of "taking small quantities and selling in small quantities" and not daring to purchase goods. For example, the Democracy Cooperative reduced the 130 kinds of fabrics it operated in the fourth quarter of last year to 22 kinds (of which 15 kinds were cloth scraps of about ten feet), and more than 60 kinds of varieties were out of stock. The County Committee then convened meetings of grassroots cooperative directors, three staff members (purchasing staff, sales staff, and accounting statisticians), and political deputies to repeatedly explain the purpose of expanding sales and the basic requirements for implementing economic accounting, and to educate cadres to actively purchase goods, expand sales, and ensure market supply. After the meeting, the cooperative business improved. The Red Flag Cooperative increased the number of commodities it operated from 328 in the fourth quarter of last year to 578 at the end of the second quarter of this year, and further increased to 660 at the end of July. The sales amount in the second quarter of this year increased by 110% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and increased by 48.6% compared with the first quarter of this year. In addition, the County Committee especially emphasized the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives, firmly grasped the principle of mutual dependence and mutual development, and constantly educated the staff of state-owned commerce and cooperatives, requiring state-owned commerce to regard assisting the development of cooperative undertakings as a political task, and cooperatives should accept the business leadership of state-owned commerce. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, organizing farmers through supply and marketing is the glorious task of cooperatives. Therefore, the cadres of state-owned commerce and cooperatives have a relatively deep understanding of the importance of close cooperation between each other, thereby ensuring the normal development of the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives.

    Under the strengthened leadership of the County Committee, the staff of state-owned commerce and the cadres of cooperatives have overcome departmentalism and the pure profit-seeking viewpoint, and have established the idea of relying on each other, combining with each other, and doing a good job in supply and marketing. The State-Owned Department Store, in analyzing the reasons why the purchase and sales plan for the first quarter of this year was not completed, believed that the decline in the proportion of wholesale to cooperatives was one of the important reasons. More than 90% of the county's population is scattered in rural areas. Relying only on four retail stores in towns and not relying on cooperatives cannot only meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, and it is also impossible for state-owned commerce to complete the plan. Therefore, they deeply realized that cooperatives are a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce and established the idea of actively relying on cooperatives. At the same time, they also criticized the departmentalism and purely profit-seeking viewpoint of individual comrades who kept good goods for themselves and pushed cold, unpopular, and defective goods to the outside, and decided that all goods that are of good quality, sell well, and meet seasonal and regional needs should be given priority and wholesale to cooperatives according to the proportion of cooperatives' sales accounting for 65% to 70% of the total sales of the department store. In order to help cooperatives solve the problem of capital turnover and fully meet the seasonal needs of farmers, short-term credit sales were implemented for cooperatives. At the same time, cooperative directors and salespersons were also invited to visit the company's warehouse frequently to become familiar with the source of goods and select goods, and they were encouraged to actively purchase goods.

    Cooperative cadres, in their actual work, also experienced that if the supply of means of livelihood is not well integrated with state-owned trading companies, it will not only fail to meet the needs of cooperative members, but also cause difficulties in their own business operations. Therefore, they established the idea that only by relying on state-owned trading companies can they develop their own business. For example, when handcart tires were out of stock in the first quarter, the cooperative did not ask the local state-owned department store for goods, but went to Shenyang to purchase a batch of goods; then the department store also purchased a batch of goods; because the purchase price and freight of the department store were lower, the selling price was cheaper than the cooperative, and as a result, the goods purchased by the cooperative had to be stockpiled. When checking the sales plan for the first quarter, on the one hand, the sales plan was only 91% completed, and on the other hand, there was a serious shortage of goods in rural areas. Therefore, the cooperative cadres deeply realized that if they left the leadership and assistance of state-owned trading companies, the source of goods would not be guaranteed, the needs of cooperative members would not be met, and difficulties would be caused in their own business operations.

    In order to strengthen the cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperatives, it is also very important to connect plans and implement the contract system under the leadership of the County Finance and Economics Committee. The process of formulating their plans is as follows: when the provincial Department of Commerce and the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives issue the control indicators for the quarterly commodity circulation plan separately, the department store immediately mobilizes all employees to study the needs of residents and compile a draft of the quarterly plan. In the process of preparing the draft plan, the department store takes the initiative to solicit the County Cooperative's plan for the materials that the department store needs to supply; the County Cooperative also consults with the department store when making the plan. The planning personnel of both parties also study together to try to achieve consistency in the time and quantity of the plans of both parties, and then submit the draft quarterly plan to the County Finance and Economics Committee for review. After the County Finance and Economics Committee reviews and balances it, it is generally approved and implemented by the provincial Department of Commerce and the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives before the quarter. Because the plan has been negotiated and balanced by both parties in advance, it not only greatly facilitates the County Finance and Economics Committee, the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, the Provincial Department of Commerce, and the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives in reviewing and balancing the plan, but also avoids mutual "collisions" or material backlog and shortages due to inconsistent plans or inconsistent commodity quantities.

    After the plans are established, both parties will negotiate and sign specific supply contracts. They have adopted the following supervision and inspection methods: 1. The County Finance and Economics Committee checks the implementation of the contract at least once a month, and corrects problems at any time. 2. On the one hand, the department store urges the cooperatives to purchase goods according to the plan and statistics, and on the other hand, it organizes personnel to go to various grassroots cooperatives to understand the implementation of the contract and assist the cooperatives in solving the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the contract; in order to urge the department store to allocate goods in a timely and correct manner and to check the implementation of the contract, the County Federation of Cooperatives also sends a special person to be stationed in the department store.

    In order to ensure the realization of their respective plans and to earnestly implement the contract, both parties have also established necessary contact systems. That is, the department store promptly notifies the cooperative to purchase new goods; it contacts the cooperative at any time when adjusting prices to seek consistent action; it informs the cooperative of insufficient supply and means of livelihood that are not operated. When the cooperative finds problems in the supply of goods and prices in the department store, it puts forward suggestions for improvement at any time, and convenes meetings of grassroots cooperative directors to invite the department store manager to participate. The responsible comrades of both the State-Owned Department Store and the Cooperative often study market and price conditions together, and promptly solve existing and occurring problems in detail. And promote the four contact systems created by Comrade Sun Fangzhi:

    1. Print "Existing Commodity Catalog" (once every half month, including unit, product name, specification, wholesale price, retail price, etc.) and send it to the 53 cooperatives in the supply area, on the one hand as the basis for the cooperative to purchase goods and abide by the national list price; on the other hand, it solves the problem of the company's one-sided backlog and one-sided shortage, and expands sales.

    2. Establish a cooperative purchase registration card so that the department store can grasp the cooperative's operating conditions and purchase conditions, understand changes in rural purchasing power, and accumulate historical data to better improve the company's and cooperative's business management.

    3. Establish a contact system with grassroots cooperative salespersons. According to the cooperative's business scope and location, select active and responsible cooperative salespersons who often report on the situation as liaison officers between the cooperative and the department store to report to the department store on the sales of commodities and consumers' opinions on commodity specifications and quality. The department store's salespersons also introduce the company's inventory and introduce commodity sales experience through the liaison officers.

    4. Liaison Officer's Special Responsibility System for Going to the Countryside. In addition to selecting cooperative salespersons as liaison officers between the department store and the cooperative, the department store also draws a salesperson to serve as a special liaison officer to go to the countryside and contact the cooperative. When the liaison officer goes to the countryside, he carries samples of the company's existing goods to promote sales to the cooperatives, and learns about the cooperative's business conditions and rural purchasing power for the company's reference when organizing the source of goods, and more closely integrates the state-owned company and the cooperative, connecting the supply and marketing situation in urban and rural areas.

    凤城国营百货公司和合作社密切结合扩大推销的经验
    陈新
    辽东省凤城县国营百货公司，几年来一直和合作社配合得很好，因而通过合作社推销商品的比例逐年增加，一九五一年通过合作社推销的商品占推销总值的百分之六十点五，一九五二年占百分之六十五点六四，一九五三年上半年已增到百分之六十七点七。合作社从凤城国营百货公司采购推销的商品总值，以一九五○年为一○○，一九五一年为一九五，一九五二年为四三四，一九五三年上半年为三四四点八，等于一九五二年同期的百分之一四九。国营商业与合作社的充分合作，巩固和扩大了国营商业在市场上的领导作用，同时也促进了合作社业务的发展。
    党委重视并加强了对商业工作的领导是凤城百货公司与合作社获得以上成绩的主要原因。自去年
  “三反”“五反”运动后，中共凤城县委就重视了对商业工作的政策思想领导。今年起，在中共凤城县委会下设立了商业组，在国营贸易公司与基层合作社配备了政治副职，并派县委委员充当县合作社联合社主任，这样，就为加强与提高商业工作准备好条件。在实际工作中，县委除经常召集国营贸易公司负责人汇报工作情况外，还经常深入检查工作，及时发现问题和解决问题。如在今年第二季度中，县委会扭转了国营贸易公司不敢大胆进货的错误做法后，发现合作社也普遍存在“零取零卖”不敢进货的现象。如民主社由去年第四季度经营的一百三十种布匹减少到二十二种（其中有十五种是十尺左右的布头），有六十多种品种脱销，县委即召开基层社主任、三员（采购员、营业员、会计统计员）和政治副职等会议，反复说明扩大推销的目的和实行经济核算的基本要求，教育干部积极进货、扩大推销、保证市场供应。会后合作社业务有了起色。红旗社经营的商品即由去年第四季度的三二八种增加到今年第二季度末的五七八种，七月末更增到六六○种，今年第二季度的卖钱额比去年第四季度增加了百分之一百一十，比今年第一季度上升百分之四十八点六。此外，县委特别重视国营商业与合作社的关系，紧紧掌握着相互依存相互发展的原则，不断教育国营商业和合作社的工作人员，要求国营商业把扶助合作事业发展当做一项政治任务，合作社应接受国营商业业务上的领导，在国营经济领导下，通过供销把农民组织起来是合作社的光荣任务。因此，国营商业和合作社干部都比较深刻地认识到彼此密切合作的重要性，从而保证了国营商业与合作社双方关系的正常发展。
    在县委加强领导下，国营商业工作人员和合作社干部克服了本位主义思想与单纯营利观点，树立了相互依靠，相互结合，做好供销工作的思想。国营百货公司在分析今年第一季度没有完成购销计划的原因时，认为对合作社批发比重的下降是重要原因之一。全县百分之九十以上人口分散在农村，仅靠城镇四个零售商店而不依靠合作社，不但不能满足广大农民的需要，并且国营商业要完成计划也不可能。因此深刻认识到合作社是国营商业的有力助手，树立了积极依靠合作社的思想。同时还批判了个别同志把好货留下自己卖，冷、背、残货向外推的本位主义思想和单纯营利观点，决定凡是质好、畅销、合乎季节和地区需要的商品，按合作社销货经常占百货公司总销售额百分之六十五至七十的比例，尽先满足和批发给合作社。并且为了帮助合作社解决资金周转困难，充分满足农民的季节性需要，对合作社实行了短期赊销。同时还邀请合作社主任及营业员经常参观公司仓库，熟悉货源，挑选商品，鼓励其积极进货。
    合作社干部在实际工作中，也体验到生活资料的供应如不与国营贸易公司结合好，不但不能满足社员需要，还会造成本身经营上的困难，因而树立了只有依靠国营贸易公司才能发展自己业务的思想。如第一季度手推车胎脱销，合作社没有向当地国营百货公司要货，到沈阳进了一批货；随后百货公司也进了一批货；由于百货公司进货价和运费较低，卖价比合作社便宜，结果合作社进来的货只好积压起来。在检查第一季度销货计划时，一方面是推销计划只完成百分之九十一，另一方面在农村中却发生商品严重脱销现象，因此，使合作社干部深深体会到如果离开了国营贸易公司的领导和帮助，货源就没有保证，就满足不了社员需要，并且会造成本身业务经营上的困难。
    为了加强国营商业与合作社的配合，在县财政经济委员会领导下，衔接计划、贯彻合同制也是很重要的。他们制订计划的经过是这样的：当省商业厅和省联社将季度商品流转计划控制指标分别下达时，百货公司即发动全体职工，研究居民需要，编制季度计划草案。在编制计划草案过程中，百货公司则主动征求县合作社提供需要百货公司供应的物资计划；县合作社在做计划时也与百货公司商量。双方计划人员并且在一起互相研究，尽量求得双方计划在时间和数量上的一致，然后将季度计划草案送县财政经济委员会审查。经过县财政经济委员会审查和平衡后，一般在季度前由双方分别报省商业厅和省联社批准执行。由于计划事先经过双方协商、平衡，不仅给县财政经济委员会、省财政经济委员会、省商业厅、省联社在审核和平衡计划工作上很大的方便，且避免了由于计划不衔接或商品数量不一致而造成相互“碰车”或物资积压与脱销等现象。
    在计划订立以后，双方即协商签订具体供应合同。他们采取了如下的督促检查办法：一、县财政经济委员会每月至少检查一次合同执行情况，发现问题，随时纠正。二、百货公司一方面根据计划、统计等情况督促合作社进货，一方面组织人员到各基层社了解执行合同的情况，并协助合作社解决执行合同时所遇到的困难；县联社为了督促百货公司及时、正确地调拨商品，以及检查执行合同情况的好坏，还派一专人常驻百货公司。
    双方为了保证实现各自的计划与认真地执行合同，还建立了必要的联系制度。这就是百货公司来了新货及时通知合作社采购；调整物价时随时和合作社联系，求得行动一致；供应不足与不经营的生活资料告知合作社。合作社发现百货公司商品供应和物价上的问题时，随时提出改进意见，并召开基层社主任等会议邀请百货公司经理参加。国营百货公司和合作社双方负责同志经常在一起研究市场、物价情况，及时具体解决存在与发生的问题。并推行孙芳芝同志创造的四种联系制度：
    1、印刷“现有商品目录表”（每半月一次，包括单位、品名、规格、批发价、零售价等）寄给供应区内的五十三个合作社，一方面作为合作社进货和遵守国家牌价的依据；另一方面解决了公司一面积压一面脱销的问题，扩大了推销。
    2、建立合作社购货登记卡片，使百货公司能掌握合作社的经营情况及进货情况，了解农村购买力变化，积累历史资料，更好地改进公司与合作社的经营管理。
    3、和基层合作社营业员建立联系制度。根据合作社经营范围及地点等情况，挑选积极负责、经常反映情况的合作社营业员，作为合作社和百货公司的联络员，向百货公司反映合作社推销商品的情况和消费者对商品规格、质量的意见，百货公司的营业员也通过联络员介绍公司库存商品情况，及介绍推销商品经验。
    4、联络员下乡专责制。除挑选合作社营业员作为百货公司与合作社的联络员外，百货公司还抽出一名营业员担任专责联络员，下乡和合作社进行联系。联络员下乡时带着公司现有的商品样品，到各合作社去宣传推销，并了解合作社的经营情况和农村购买力，供公司组织货源时的参考，把国营公司与合作社更密切结合起来，串通城乡的供销情况。
