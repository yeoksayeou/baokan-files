Nanjing literary and art workers, in the general election movement, combined it with their own work and used various methods to conduct general election propaganda to the city's people. Under the leadership of the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, some professional and amateur literary and art workers created 62 literary and artistic programs in 14 forms such as scripts, ballads, and clapper talks to promote the general election. Some of these have been performed by more than 20 theater troupes. More than 1,000 ballad singers in places such as Confucius Temple, Xin Jie Kou, and Chao Tian Gong also performed these programs. Some veteran actors and artists used their many years of experience in the old and new societies to compose programs for storytelling and singing. The actors of the "Lian San" Yangju Opera Troupe in Xiaguan spared their rest time to rehearse general election programs and have successively performed plays such as "Zhang Xiulan Looks at the List" and "Aunt Zhang Receives the Voter Certificate", which are very popular among the audience. The Nanjing Experimental Yangju Opera Troupe's training class toured the districts and performed plays such as "Elect the Sweetheart" in open-air performances, totaling 32 shows with more than 17,000 viewers. The amateur art teams in each district also took the initiative to cooperate with each report meeting to sing general election programs. In addition, music and art workers also created many songs and pictures to participate in the general election propaganda.

In the spare time of their busy performances, the literary and art workers in Nanjing seriously studied the general election documents and participated in the election work. More than 500 artists in the Confucius Temple area have held more than four discussions on issues related to the general election. More than 40 people from the city's opera circles participated in the election work. Tang Zhenxiang, an actor from the Hufeng Huju Opera Troupe, also squeezed time after the show to assist the general election work group in conducting population surveys, writing voter lists, and planning general election propaganda work.

    南京文艺工作者积极参加普选
    南京市文学艺术工作者在普选运动中，结合本身业务，用各种方式向全市人民进行普选宣传。在南京市文学艺术界联合会领导下，部分专业和业余文艺工作者创作了宣传普选的剧本、鼓词、快板等十四种形式的文艺节目共六十二个。其中一部分已由二十多个剧团演出。夫子庙、新街口、朝天宫等场地有一千多曲艺工作者也演出了这些节目。有些老演员、老艺人用自己多年来在新旧社会的见闻编成节目说唱。下关的“联三”扬剧团的演员们，抽出休息时间排演普选节目，已先后演出“张秀兰看榜”、“张大娘领选民证”等剧，很受观众欢迎。南京市实验扬剧团学员班在各区巡回露天演出“选出心上人”等剧，共计三十二场，观众达一万七千多人。各区业余文艺队也都主动配合每次报告会演唱普选节目。此外，音乐、美术工作者也创作了不少歌曲和画片，参加普选宣传。
    南京市文艺工作者们在繁忙演出的空隙，认真学习了普选文件和参加选举工作。夫子庙一带五百多艺人已举行了四次以上有关普选问题的讨论。全市戏曲界有四十多人参加了选举工作。沪风沪剧团演员唐祯祥等，在散戏后还挤出时间，协助普选工作组进行人口调查，写选民榜，计划普选宣传工作。（新华社）
