    [This News Report] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on November 25 regarding the study, publicity, and implementation of the general line for the transition period. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

    Chairman Mao pointed out: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation, this is a transition period. The general line and general task for this transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a considerable period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. This general line is the lighthouse that illuminates all our work. Departing from it in any work will lead to right-leaning or left-leaning errors."

    In order to effectively implement the Party's, and also the state's, general line for the transition period in all aspects of trade union work, and to ensure that all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff understand this general line, trade union cadres at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously, systematically, and with organization study the general line, deeply understand its spirit and essence, and, through trade union cadres, vigorously promote the general line to the broad masses of workers and their families. For this purpose, the following instructions are hereby issued:

    1.  The study of the general line is the most fundamental ideological construction work of the trade union during the transition period. Responsible comrades of trade union organizations at all levels must personally take charge and lead the study of the general line. When studying the general line, it is necessary to combine it with actual work and the thinking of cadres, continue to improve the ideological level of trade union cadres, and continue to strictly criticize those incorrect ideological tendencies that only care about the present, not the future, and only care about life, not production.

    2.  It is imperative to vigorously carry out the publicity of the Party's general line for the transition period among the broad masses of workers and their families. The propaganda departments and workers' newspapers and periodicals of trade union organizations at all levels must, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, formulate plans for publicizing the general line, and, in conjunction with the specific conditions of each region and industry, actively promote the general line in depth and vividly to all workers and their families, so that every worker and their family understands that only by realizing the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce can China be transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country, and can the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the working class and all working people be met. The working class bears the primary responsibility for realizing this great and arduous historical task.

    3.  In the propaganda and education of the general line, it must be emphasized that individual interests are subordinate to national interests, current interests are subordinate to long-term interests, and partial interests are subordinate to overall interests. It must be emphasized that the beautiful future of socialism can only be obtained through our own selfless labor. Therefore, in the process of propaganda and education, it is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome the influence of the bourgeois selfish and decadent ideas on cadres and workers, and must publicize the spirit of hard struggle and the conservation system of the Soviet working class in socialist construction, and promote the glorious tradition of the Chinese working class of being brave, diligent, and hardworking, and inspire the labor enthusiasm of the masses.

    4.  The most important step in implementing the general line in trade union work is to mobilize the broad masses of workers to complete or overfulfill the state's construction plan. Because only the rapid development of industry, especially heavy industry, can strengthen the leading role of the socialist economy over other economic components, effectively promote the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts, and achieve socialist industrialization. The basic method for completing or overfulfilling the state plan is labor emulation. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must combine the study and publicity of the general line with the further advancement of the production increase and economy practice labor emulation to ensure the successful completion of the country's first five-year construction plan. This means that we must move the primary labor emulation, which focuses on increasing the quantity of products, further forward, so that labor emulation is combined with learning from advanced Soviet experience and improving production technology, and that labor emulation is combined with strengthening planned management, making full use of existing equipment, and comprehensively achieving national indicators in terms of output, quality, cost, and safety.

    5.  Trade union organizations and workers in capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises bear the important responsibility of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Trade union organizations and workers in capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises must, on the one hand, educate the capitalists and assist them in improving business management and developing production and business that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; on the other hand, they must supervise the capitalists to ensure that they abide by the state's policies and laws. From these two aspects, guide the capitalists to embark on the path of state capitalism. Trade union organizations and workers in state capitalist enterprises should actively participate in enterprise management, carry out labor emulation, improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and improve product quality, so that the various systems and production levels of these enterprises gradually keep pace with state-owned enterprises, and the socialist transformation gradually deepens.

    6.  Peasants and handicraftsmen are reliable allies of the working class, and trade unions should find effective methods to help the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts - the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Trade union organizations must repeatedly conduct education on the worker-peasant alliance among workers, so that the broad masses of workers understand the important role of agricultural production in national construction, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and promote the glorious tradition of worker-peasant unity, hard struggle, and victory. Those phenomena that neglect agriculture and disrespect peasants are extremely harmful and must be corrected.

### 中华全国总工会发出指示  号召各级工会宣传和贯彻总路线

    中华全国总工会发出指示
    号召各级工会宣传和贯彻总路线
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会在十一月二十五日发出关于学习、宣传与贯彻过渡时期的总路线的指示。指示全文如下：
    毛主席指示：“从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。这条总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔，各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或左倾的错误。”
    为了在工会的各项工作中切实贯彻过渡时期党的也是国家的总路线，并使全体工人、工程技术人员和职员都懂得这个总路线，工会各级干部，必须在党的领导下认真地有组织有计划地学习总路线，深刻地领会总路线的精神与实质，并通过工会干部向广大职工及其家属，大张旗鼓地展开总路线的宣传。为此特作如下指示：
    一、总路线的学习是工会在过渡时期最根本的思想建设工作。工会各级组织的负责同志，必须亲自动手，领导总路线的学习。在学习总路线的时候，必须结合实际工作和干部的思想，继续提高工会干部的思想水平，对于那些只顾眼前、不顾将来，只顾生活、不顾生产的不正确的思想倾向必须继续予以严格的批判。
    二、必须在广大职工群众及其家属中，大张旗鼓地展开党在过渡时期的总路线的宣传工作。工会各级组织的宣传部门、工人报刊，均须在党委统一领导下制订宣传总路线的计划，结合各地区各产业的具体情况，积极向全体职工及其家属深入地、生动地宣传总路线，务使每一个职工及其家属都懂得：只有实现国家社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，才能使中国由落后的农业国变成一个社会主义工业国，才能满足工人阶级和全体劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化需要。而工人阶级对于实现这一伟大艰巨的历史任务，是担负着主要责任的。
    三、在总路线的宣传教育中，必须强调个人利益服从国家利益，目前利益服从长远利益，局部利益服从整体利益。必须强调指出：社会主义的美好前途是要经过我们自己的忘我的劳动才能获得的。所以在宣传教育过程中，要开展批评与自我批评，克服资产阶级那种自私自利的腐朽思想对干部和工人群众的影响，必须宣传苏联工人阶级在社会主义建设中的艰苦斗争的精神和节约制度，发扬中国工人阶级勇敢勤劳艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，鼓舞群众的劳动热情。
    四、在工会工作中贯彻总路线的最主要的步骤，是动员全体职工群众完成或超额完成国家的建设计划。因为只有工业特别是重工业的迅速发展，才能加强社会主义经济对于其他各种经济成分的领导作用，才能有效地促进资本主义工商业和农业、手工业的社会主义改造，才有社会主义工业化。而完成或超额完成国家计划的基本方法则是劳动竞赛。所以工会各级组织必须结合总路线的学习与宣传，把增产节约劳动竞赛向前推进一步，保证国家的第一个五年建设计划的胜利完成。这就是说要把偏重于增加产品数量的初级的劳动竞赛，向前推进一步，使劳动竞赛与学习苏联先进经验、改进生产技术相结合，使劳动竞赛与加强计划管理相结合，充分利用现有设备，在产量、质量、成本和安全等方面，全面地达到国家指标。
    五、在资本主义工商企业中的工会组织和职工群众，担负着对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的重大责任。资本主义工商业中的工会组织和职工群众，必须一方面对资本家进行教育，并协助资本家改善经营管理，发展有利于国计民生的生产和营业；另一方面，必须监督资本家，使之遵守国家的政策法令。从这两个方面来引导资本家走上国家资本主义的道路。在国家资本主义企业中的工会组织和职工群众，更应积极地参加企业管理，开展劳动竞赛，提高劳动生产率，减低生产成本，提高产品质量，使这些企业的各种制度和生产水平逐步地与国营企业看齐，使社会主义改造逐步深入。
    六、农民和手工业者是工人阶级可靠的同盟，工会对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造——互助合作运动，应该找寻有效的方法予以帮助。工会组织必须对职工群众反复进行工农联盟的教育，使广大职工群众了解农业生产在国家建设中的重大作用，巩固工农联盟，发扬工农联合、艰苦奋斗取得胜利的光荣传统。那些忽视农业和对农民不尊重的现象是极端有害的，必须加以纠正。
