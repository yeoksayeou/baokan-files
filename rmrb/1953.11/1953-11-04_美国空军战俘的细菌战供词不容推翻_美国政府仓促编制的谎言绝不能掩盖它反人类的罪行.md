Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The U.S. government is now trying to use lies to weave a curtain to cover up the truth about U.S. germ warfare, which has been exposed by U.S. Air Force POWs. In the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee hall, U.S. Representative Mayo repeatedly spoke and even produced so-called "affidavits," trying to make people believe that these Air Force POWs made false confessions under "torture" by the Korean and Chinese sides. However, unfortunately for the United States, there are huge loopholes in this curtain, which cannot cover up the truth.

The American tricksters' claim that the so-called confessions are "fabricated" cannot deceive anyone who has ever seen the POWs' confessions. The Korean and Chinese sides successively published the confessions of six U.S. Air Force POWs in 1952 and 1953. These six POWs belonged to different units, and the times of their capture and confession were also different. However, many of the facts they confessed could corroborate each other. Moreover, the complex details and technical processes of the U.S. germ warfare mentioned in these confessions are so detailed and clear that they could not have been stated so clearly and reasonably if they had not personally participated in it.

Here are some examples. For example, regarding the time when the United States began germ warfare in Korea, both Huweibuer, Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing, and Blay, Ordnance Officer, confessed that it was in the winter of 1951. Huweibuer said: "The overall plan for germ warfare in Korea was instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951." The order was issued through Ridgway and Weyland, and after that, germ warfare began. The time they mentioned is consistent with the earlier confession of another U.S. Air Force POW, O'Neill, a pilot of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. O'Neill said in his confession in June 1952: "This group clearly had an operational policy of dropping germ bombs in January 1952, because when I arrived at this group, there was already a definite procedure. As far as I know, I thought this policy would take at least a month to plan, prepare, and train. That is to say, the 18th Group must have been dropping germ bombs since mid-December 1951, or even earlier. Judging from all the signs, the U.S. military's decision to conduct germ warfare in Korea was made as early as the autumn of 1951. This gave them several months to transport the necessary personnel and equipment to the war zone and establish the policy and procedures for conducting germ warfare." Huweibuer belonged to the Marine Corps, and O'Neill belonged to the Air Force. They were captured and confessed at different times. When O'Neill confessed, Huweibuer had not yet been captured. However, the facts they confessed completely coincided.

For another example, four U.S. Air Force POWs mentioned in their confessions that they had heard courses on germ warfare before and after the United States began germ warfare. The earliest was Knise, who confessed that he heard one at Craig Air Force Base in the United States in June 1951. Others, such as Inak, Quinn, and O'Neill, also said that they had heard germ warfare courses in the second half of 1951 and the beginning of 1952, either at bases in the Kunsan and Wonju areas of Korea, or at Iwakuni Air Base in Japan, or at Luke Air Force Base and Stoneman Barracks in the United States. And the content of the lectures was basically the same. The instructors talked about various possible methods of conducting germ warfare, such as directly spraying bacteria from aircraft, or using air-bursting and parachute-type germ bombs, etc. They belonged to different units, but one after another, they admitted that during this period when the United States began germ warfare, they heard courses with largely similar content from different instructors at different locations. This proves that in order to carry out germ warfare, the United States had extensively trained the relevant air force personnel. This matter is by no means accidental.

It can also be seen that the POWs' descriptions of the types of American aircraft participating in germ warfare are also consistent. Inak and Quinn were pilots of B-26 aircraft of the 3rd Bombardment Wing. They confessed that they participated in the task of dropping germ bombs in January 1952. O'Neill and Knise were pilots of F-51 fighter planes of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. They also confessed that they were ordered to participate in germ warfare. These details they confessed were later confirmed in the confessions of Huweibuer and Blay. Huweibuer said: In January 1952, when the 1st Marine Air Wing was ordered to participate in germ warfare, the "B-26 aircraft of the 3rd Bombardment Wing had already begun germ warfare operations." Blay pointed out in his confession that after the B-26 and B-29 aircraft participated in germ warfare, "fighters were also dispatched to use germ bombs."

The fact that the POWs' confessions can corroborate each other is prominently reflected in the "secrecy" issue. All the POWs mentioned that throughout the entire process of germ warfare, the U.S. military authorities emphasized "secrecy" the most. When attending germ warfare courses, the instructors repeatedly warned the listeners that the course content was "top secret" and "must not be discussed with anyone." When carrying out germ warfare missions, orders and reports were communicated using code names and code words, such as "super propaganda," "super pro," "non-explosive bombs," "suppression of anti-aircraft fire missions," and "special missions," to replace "germ bombs" and "germ warfare." Air Force personnel were not allowed to discuss matters related to germ warfare with each other. They were all warned that if they violated secrecy, they would be subjected to "military trial." The POWs unanimously mentioned these situations, clearly exposing the U.S. side's cowardice in trying to cover up the crimes of germ warfare. This is not out of some "fabrication," is it not obvious?

The consistent facts confessed by the POWs are not limited to these. There is no need to give more examples. Just comparing the confessions made by the two POWs, Huweibuer and Blay, will yield countless examples. The details they talked about regarding the 1st Marine Air Wing's participation in germ warfare are completely consistent and complementary. All these examples show that the so-called confessions are "fabricated" is itself a fabrication; and the facts of U.S. germ warfare confessed by these POWs under the influence of the humanitarian spirit of the Korean and Chinese sides and driven by conscience, are completely beyond doubt in their authenticity.

The U.S. government's attempt to wash away its crimes against humanity in germ warfare is futile. There is already a large amount of human and material evidence to prove this. Many international impartial individuals, especially the International Scientific Commission composed of famous scientists from various countries, after conducting on-site investigations, have even irrefutably confirmed this serious crime of the United States. At the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, British representative Lloyd, who was siding with the United States, dared not face the evidence but wanted to absolve the United States of its guilt. He attacked the report of the International Scientific Commission, saying: "I have never seen such a thing as writing so much material to prove so little." It should be answered to Mayo and Lloyd: Wanting to use some empty "fabricated" lies to overturn so much evidence is something that has never been seen before.

    美国空军战俘的细菌战供词不容推翻
    美国政府仓促编制的谎言绝不能掩盖它反人类的罪行
    【新华社三日讯】美国政府现在竭力想用谎话编织的幕布，来掩盖已经为美国空军战俘暴露的美国细菌战真相。在联合国大会政治委员会会场里，美国代表梅奥一次一次发言，还提出了什么“宣誓书”，想使人相信这些空军战俘是在朝中方面“酷刑”逼迫下作了假供词。然而对于美国说来，不幸的是这张幕布上却有着巨大的漏洞，掩盖不住事实的真相。
    所谓供词是“虚构的”这种美国骗子的说法，决不能蒙蔽任何一个曾经看过战俘供词的人。朝中方面在一九五二年和一九五三年中曾陆续发表了六个美国空军战俘的供词。这六个战俘属于不同的部队，被俘和作供的时间也各不相同，然而，他们供认的许多事实都能互相印证。而这些供词中所谈到的美国进行细菌战的复杂情节和技术过程，又是那么详尽明晰，如果不是他们亲身参与，是不能说得这样清楚和入情入理的。
    这里不妨举出一些例子。如关于美国在朝鲜开始进行细菌战的时间，据美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长许威布尔和军械官布莱先后供认，都说是在一九五一年冬。许威布尔说：“在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划，是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。”命令经李奇微、威兰下达，在此之后，细菌战就开始了。他们所说的这个时间，和另一个美国空军战俘、第十八战斗轰炸机大队的驾驶员奥尼尔早先供认的相一致。奥尼尔在一九五二年六月的供词中就说：“这个大队明显在一九五二年一月已有进行投掷细菌弹的作战方针，因为当我到达这个大队的时候，便已有了确定的程序。就我所知，我以为这个方针至少要有一个月的时间来计划、准备和训练。这就是说，第十八大队一定自一九五一年十二月中旬以来，甚或更早，就已投掷细菌弹了。从一切象征来判断，美军在朝鲜进行细菌战是早在一九五一年秋天就已决定的。这样便有几个月的时间好把必需的人员和装备运到战区，并建立起进行细菌战的方针和程序。”许威布尔和奥尼尔，一个属于海军陆战队，一个属于空军，他们在不同的时间被俘、作供，在奥尼尔供认时，许威布尔还没有被俘。而他们所供认的事实却完全吻合。
    再如，四个美国空军战俘在供词中都谈到，他们在美国开始细菌战前后都曾经听过关于细菌战的课程。最早的是克尼斯，他供认，一九五一年六月在美国克莱格基地，他就听了一次。其余的如伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔也都说，他们在一九五一年下半年和一九五二年初，或在朝鲜的群山和原州地区的基地，或在日本的岩国基地，或在美国的卢克基地和史东曼兵营，都曾听过细菌战课程。而讲课的内容基本上都是一致的。教员们谈到进行细菌战的各种可能的方法，如由飞机直接喷撒细菌、或用空中爆裂型的和降落伞型的细菌弹等。他们属于不同的部队，但先后都承认，在这一个美国开始进行细菌战的时期，在不同的地点听到不同的教员讲内容大体类同的课程，这证明了美国为了进行细菌战，对有关的空军人员曾广泛地进行了训练。这件事就决不是偶然的。
    还可以看到，这些战俘谈到关于参加细菌战的美国飞机的类型的情形也是一致的。伊纳克和奎恩是第三轰炸机联队的B—二十六型飞机的飞行员，他们供认，在一九五二年一月参加了投掷细菌弹的任务。奥尼尔和克尼斯是第十八战斗轰炸机大队的F—五十一型战斗机的驾驶员，他们也供认，曾奉命参加了细菌战。他们供认的这些情节，在后来许威布尔和布莱的供词中得到证明。许威布尔说：在一九五二年一月，海军陆战队第一空军联队奉命参加细菌战时，空军第三轰炸机联队的“B—二十六型飞机已经开始了细菌战的行动”。布莱在供词中则指出：随着B—二十六、B—二十九型机参加细菌战后，“战斗机也被派使用细菌弹”。
    战俘供认的事实能互相印证，突出地表现在“保密”问题上。所有的战俘都谈到，在进行细菌战的全部过程中，美国军事当局最强调的就是“保密”。在听细菌战课程时，那些教官一再告诫听讲者说，课程内容是“极机密”的，“不得与任何人谈论”。在执行细菌战任务时，传达命令和汇报都用代名词和暗语，如“超级宣传”、“超宣”、“不爆炸的炸弹”、“压制高射炮火任务”、“特殊任务”等，来代替“细菌弹”和“细菌战”。空军人员相互之间都不准谈论有关细菌战的事情。他们都受到警告，如果违反保密，就要受“军事审判”。战俘们一致谈到了这些情形，清楚地暴露出了美方竭力要掩盖细菌战罪行的卑怯。这并非出于什么“虚构”，难道不是很明显的吗？
    战俘们供认的一致的事实还不止这一些。无须举更多的例子，只要把许威布尔和布莱这两个战俘所作的供词对照看一下也就能得到无数例证。他们所谈到的关于海军陆战队第一空军联队参加细菌战的经过情节，是完全吻合并互相补充的。所有这些例证，都说明：所谓供词是“虚构的”这种说法本身才是虚构的；而这些战俘们在朝中方面人道主义精神感召下，受良心驱使所供认的美国细菌战事实，其真实性是完全无可怀疑的。
    美国政府妄想洗刷它反人类的细菌战罪行，是徒然的。这已有大量人证和物证作为证明。许多国际公正人士特别是由各国著名科学家组成的国际科学委员会，在实地进行调查以后，更无可辩驳地证实了美国这一严重罪行。在联合国大会政治委员会上替美国帮腔的英国代表劳埃德不敢面对证据，却想替美国脱罪。他攻击国际科学委员会的报告书说：“写了那么多的材料来证明那么少的东西，这种事情从来没有见过”。应该回答梅奥和劳埃德：要想用一些空空洞洞的“虚构的”谎话来推倒那么多的证据，这种事情才是从来没有见过的。
