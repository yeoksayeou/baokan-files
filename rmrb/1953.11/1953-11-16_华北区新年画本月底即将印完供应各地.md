　　North China Region's New Year Picture Books to be Printed and Supplied to Various Regions by the End of This Month
    The North China Region's New Year picture creation for this year has been completed according to plan, and printing can be finished by the end of November, in time to supply to various regions.

    The nineteen types of New Year pictures created this year cover various aspects such as geological exploration, farmers supporting national industrialization, peaceful rural labor life, learning culture, happy children, and the people's love for the Volunteer Army. The creative themes of this year's New Year pictures generally pay attention to combining with the publicity of the general line of the transition period, portraying the noble ideological qualities of new characters, and reflecting the realistic life atmosphere of the great motherland. The conceptual and formulaic tendencies of the past have been changed. This is a significant achievement of art workers in the North China region after learning socialist realism creation methods. Art workers Chen Yin and Qin Zheng, after going deep into the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province to experience life, created two better New Year pictures, "Reporting a Mine" and "Helping Dad Solve Problems." The picture "Reporting a Mine" focuses on showing an old man and his grandson reporting their patriotic enthusiasm for reporting a mine to geological personnel, and reflecting the hard work of geological personnel in the deep mountains. "This Grain is Sold to the State," collectively created by Zhao Fengchuan and others, expresses the theme of promoting the general line of the transition period to farmers. The picture depicts a middle-peasant family selling surplus grain to the state to support national industrialization after a debate between father and son. The New Year picture "Shen Jilan," in the form of a four-panel screen, depicts Shen Jilan, the vice chairman of the Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative, mobilizing women to participate in production and achieving equal pay for equal work. The picture is beautiful and vividly shows the landscape of the Taihang Mountains. "Sister-in-law Comes to Be a Little Teacher," created by Cheng Guiping and other art workers who went deep into the rural areas of Xingtai County, Hebei Province to experience life, is also a good New Year picture, showing a daughter-in-law testing her mother-in-law on new words, explaining the new relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law through a family learning culture.

　　华北区新年画本月底即将印完供应各地
    华北区今年的新年画创作已按计划完成，十一月底可以印完，及时供应各地。
    今年创作的十九种新年画，内容有地质勘测、农民支援国家工业化、农村和平劳动生活、学文化、幸福儿童和人民热爱志愿军等各方面。今年年画的创作主题一般地都注意了结合过渡时期总路线的宣传，刻画了新人物的高尚思想品质，画中体现出伟大祖国的现实生活气息，往年概念化公式化的倾向已有所改变。这是华北区美术工作者学习社会主义现实主义创作方法后的显著收获。美术工作者陈因、秦征经过深入河北省龙烟铁矿体验生活，创作出“报矿”、“帮助爸爸解难题”两幅较好的年画。“报矿”的画面上集中表现一位老汉和他的孙儿向地质人员报矿的爱国热情，并反映出地质人员在深山里艰苦工作的景象。赵枫川等四人集体创作的“这粮食是卖给国家的”，表现了向农民宣传过渡时期总路线的主题思想。画中描写一个中农家庭里经过父子争论后，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业化。采用四扇屏形式的年画“申纪兰”，描绘李顺达农业生产合作社的副社长申纪兰发动妇女参加生产，取得了男女同工同酬的情景，画面优美，生动地表现了太行山区的风貌。深入河北省邢台县农村体验生活的美术工作者程贵平等创作的“嫂嫂来做小先生”，也是一幅较好的年画，表现儿媳在考问婆婆生字，通过一家人学文化来说明新的婆媳关系。
