Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 4th: Polish newspapers published the "The achievements since the implementation of the Six-Year Plan and the main economic tasks of the last two years of the Six-Year Plan (1954 and 1955)," the outline adopted by the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party at the end of October. This outline will be submitted to the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party for discussion in mid-January 1954.

The outline details the achievements of Poland from 1950 to 1953 in industry, agriculture, capital construction, and improving the living standards of the working people, and stipulates the tasks for developing the national economy from 1954 to 1955.

The outline states: In the first four years of the Six-Year Plan, the Polish United Workers' Party and the People's Government concentrated on solving some major tasks related to the country's socialist industrialization. During this period, industry, especially heavy industry, achieved great achievements. The socialist components in industry, transportation, construction, and trade have been strengthened. However, in the process of implementing the Six-Year Plan, the development of the national economy has been very uneven. First of all, agricultural production has developed too slowly. From 1950 to 1953, the level of industrial production increased by 115 percent, while the level of agricultural production only increased by 9 percent. The tasks set for the first four years of the Six-Year Plan were completed by 114.7 percent in the industrial sector, but only 82 percent in the agricultural sector.

The part of the outline on industry states: From 1950 to 1953, industrial production increased by 115 percent; of which heavy industry increased by 135 percent, the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 150 percent; while light industry only increased by 99 percent. The task of developing light industry stipulated for the first four years in the Six-Year Plan has not been completed. The outline stipulates that from 1954 to 1955, industrial production should increase by 23 to 24 percent, and stipulates that the consumer goods industry should be developed at a faster rate. The outline then stipulated the goals for increasing the production of food and consumer industrial products: for example, bread should increase to about 112 percent of 1953, meat about 111 percent, animal oil about 123 percent, canned fish about 130 percent, sugar about 107 percent, woolen fabrics about 110 percent, cotton fabrics about 112 percent, etc.

The part of the outline on agriculture pointed out that from 1950 to 1953, agriculture increased by 9 percent. The outline stipulates that from 1954 to 1955, agricultural production should increase by 10 percent. Among them, the potato harvest should increase to 105 to 107 percent of 1953, the number of cattle should increase to 107 to 110 percent, and pigs 110 to 115 percent. The outline also stipulates that from 1954 to 1955, the production of agricultural machinery and equipment will increase to 200 percent of 1953, and artificial fertilizers will increase to 135 percent.

The part of the outline on capital construction says: In 1955, investment in agriculture will increase to 145 percent of 1953, investment in the consumer goods industry will increase to 138 percent, investment in housing and public buildings will increase to 126 percent, and investment in social and cultural construction will increase to 134 percent.

    提纲中关于农业的部分指出，从一九五○年到一九五三年，农业增加了百分之九。提纲中规定，在一九五四年到一九五五年中，农业生产要增加百分之十。其中马铃薯的收获量要增为一九五三年的百分之一百零五到一百零七，牛的头数增为百分之一百零七到百分之一百一十，猪百分之一百一十到百分之一百一十五。提纲还规定从一九五四年到一九五五年，农业机器和设备的生产增为一九五三年的百分之二百，人工肥料增为百分之一百三十五。
    提纲中关于基本建设的部分说：一九五五年，农业投资将增为一九五三年的百分之一百四十五，日用品工业方面的投资增为百分之一百三十八，住宅和公用建筑方面的投资增为百分之一百二十六，社会和文化建设方面的投资增为百分之一百三十四。
