Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 12th: Recently returned personnel from our side who had been captured have testified that despite the explanation work having started twenty-nine days ago, the prisoners of war still know nothing about it. Miao Fulu, a volunteer army returnee who escaped from Camp No. 12 by climbing over the barbed wire on the 7th of this month to request repatriation, said that he didn't know the explanation work had started on that day, nor did he know when it was interrupted. He said: "The special agent battalion commander only told us after the first interruption of the explanation work: The Communists explained to two camps and now they dare not come. As long as we delay for three months, we can go out after the term expires."

Many returnees do not know that the period of time the prisoners of war are under the supervision of the Neutral Nations is one hundred and twenty days. The U.S. side and the special agents under its command simply do not let the prisoners of war know the clause regarding the “Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.” Miao Fulu said that he had never heard the broadcast of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." On the first day the broadcast began, the special agents coerced the prisoners of war to sing reactionary songs loudly, and the next day they smashed the broadcasting equipment. Therefore, the prisoners of war still regard the explanation work as "screening," thinking it is the same as the bloody "screening" on April 8th last year.

Returnees said that various absurd claims distorting the explanation work are circulating in the prisoner-of-war camps. These lies roughly include: 1. Applying for repatriation after listening to the explanation requires "approval" from five neutral countries, "and if one neutral country does not raise its hand, one cannot leave." The special agents also said that among the five neutral countries, Switzerland and Sweden might not raise their hands. 2. After the request for repatriation is "approved," one must be sent back to the original camp for three months before repatriation. The special agents threatened that as soon as one is sent back to the original camp, one should not expect to live. 3. The Korean armistice is only a temporary truce, and fighting will break out again in three months; behind the Neutral Nations' supervision camps and explanation sites are U.S. tanks and artillery, as well as three divisions of troops, and those who apply for repatriation at that time will be killed. 4. Outside the exit of each explanation tent are special agents with knives guarding it, and anyone who asks for repatriation will be killed on the spot.

Miao Fulu said that the U.S. side's clamoring to limit the explanation time is clearly intended, among other things, to ensure that prisoners of war do not have time to understand what the explanation is about after entering the explanation tent before being dragged out. This would deprive the prisoners of war of the opportunity to request repatriation. Miao Fulu himself believed that listening to the explanation would not lead to repatriation, and therefore escaped from the barbed wire to request repatriation.

All the Korean and Chinese captured personnel who requested to return without having been explained to unanimously said that they felt that requesting repatriation after listening to the explanation was almost impossible. Therefore, they would rather risk the double danger of being beaten to death by special agents or Indian guards to climb the barbed wire and escape from the camp.

### 美方特务散布种种谣言歪曲解释工作

    美方特务散布种种谣言歪曲解释工作
    【新华社开城十二日电】最近归来的我方被俘人员证明：尽管解释工作已经开始了二十九天，但战俘们对解释工作还是毫无所知。本月七日从十二号营场翻铁丝网逃出要求遣返的志愿军归来人员苗福禄说，他根本不知道解释工作在那一天开始，也不知道解释工作在那一天又中断的。他说：“特务大队长只是在解释工作第一次中断以后告诉我们说：共产党曾经解释了两个营场，现在又不敢来了。我们只要拖延到三个月的时间，满期后就可以出去了。”
    许多归来人员都不知道战俘由中立国看管的时间是一百二十天，美方及其指挥下的特务根本不让战俘们知道“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的条款。苗福禄说，他也从来没有听到过“解释和访问工作细则”的广播。在开始广播的第一天，特务就胁迫战俘大声唱反动歌曲，第二天便把广播器砸坏了。因此，战俘们还一直把解释工作看成是“审查”，以为是和去年四月八日的血腥“甄别”一样。
    归来人员说，在战俘营中流传着特务歪曲解释工作的种种荒谬说法。这些谎言大致有：一、在听取解释后申请遣返要经五个中立国“批准”，“如有一个中立国不举手就走不成”，特务还说，五个中立国当中瑞士、瑞典就不一定举手。二、在要求遣返得到“批准”之后还要送回到原来营场等三个月后才能遣返，特务恐吓说，只要送回原来营场，就别想活命。三、朝鲜停战只是暂时的休战，三个月中又会打起来；在中立国看管营和解释场所后面有美军的坦克和大炮，还有三个师的军队，那时申请遣返的人就会被打死。四、每一个解释帐篷的申请遣返的出口外面都有带着刀子的特务分子守着，谁要求遣返就会当场被杀掉。
    苗福禄说，连日美方叫嚷着要限制解释时间，其目的之一显然是使战俘进入解释帐篷后来不及弄清楚解释是怎么回事，就被拖出帐篷。这样就可以剥夺战俘要求遣返的机会。苗福禄自己就认为听解释不能得到遣返，因而逃出铁丝网要求遣返。
    没有经过解释而要求归来的所有朝中被俘人员一致说，他们觉得听解释要求遣返几乎是不可能的事，因此宁可冒着被特务或印度卫兵打死的双重危险爬铁丝网逃出营场来。
