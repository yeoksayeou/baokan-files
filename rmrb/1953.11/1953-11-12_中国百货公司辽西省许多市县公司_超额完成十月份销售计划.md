Many City and County Companies of the China Department Store in Liaoxi Province
Exceed October Sales Plan

    All employees of the China Department Store Liaoxi Provincial Company responded to the call for increased production and conservation, actively carried out sales competitions, and by the end of October, they had exceeded the monthly sales plan by 6% (accounting for 30.24% of the quarterly plan). Among them, sixteen city and county companies including Changtu, Tieling, Siping, Lishu, Heishan, and Xinmin exceeded the plan; Jinxi, Xingcheng, Kaiyuan, and five other counties were close to completion; only Suizhong, Jin County and three other counties were relatively poor.
    The leaders of each city and county company have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the provincial increase production and conservation meeting, and most employees clearly understand that the goal of the increase production and conservation of the state-owned commercial system should be to expand sales, ensure market supply, and reduce circulation costs. They discussed and acted simultaneously, and the increase production and conservation competition gradually deepened. For example, the Tieling County Company organized the directors and salespersons of grassroots cooperatives to visit the warehouse and signed contracts worth 12 billion yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the company's total sales plan; the manager personally grasped and inspected the organization of supply work, overcame difficulties in transportation, and directly purchased goods from Shenyang, and by the end of the month, more than half of the quarterly purchase plan had been completed, ensuring a sufficient supply of materials; Zhang Laiyu's team in the first store had a clear division of labor, unity, and mutual assistance, and a good attitude, and also created a "circulating inventory method" to consolidate the results of the inventory; the shoe and hat group of the third store contacted Rongjun Middle School and completed the group plan ahead of schedule. The whole county exceeded the monthly plan by 6%. Changtu County Department Store signed specific product contracts worth 12.1 billion yuan with thirty-one central cooperatives, and the director of the wholesale store personally went to the grassroots cooperatives to help increase the variety of products; salesman Liu Gui saw that farmers were spending high prices to buy old sacks in Siping, so he suggested that the cooperative operate sacks, and sold 500 sacks to the grassroots society in ten days, meeting the needs of farmers, and exceeding the monthly plan by 19%. The Siping City Company evaluated the circulating red flag once every ten days, and appropriately expanded and adjusted the winter goods display area. The winter goods of the first store were moved from upstairs to downstairs, and eight comrades were transferred to work in the wholesale store. Lishu County Company acted early, focusing on cooperating with grain purchase, going deep into the grassroots cooperatives to help improve business management and expand varieties. The wholesale store also simplified procedures and systems, and completed the monthly plan ahead of schedule. The Beizhen County Company's wholesale store sent special personnel to the countryside to help cooperatives promote sales. Just helping the Mindianzi Cooperative sell cloth increased the amount of money sold by one time; the Xinlitun store of the Heishan County Company shortened the time for goods to leave the warehouse, making it easier for cooperatives to pick up goods; Beizhen, Faku, and other counties also established communication relations with cooperatives to exchange sales and inventory information; the salespersons of the Fifth Store of the Jinzhou City Company went out to find cargo owners in their spare time, and so far the stationery group has established twenty-six fixed customers, so they all overfulfilled the October plan. Even the carters of the Heishan County Company put forward the method of "hurrying early rather than late" in the transportation work. They loaded the trucks at night and left early in the morning, shortening the transportation time and ensuring the timely supply of goods; the cooks of the Gongzhutun store of the Xinmin County Company helped carry cloth and sell cotton in addition to doing a good job in the food for the employees, and worked hard to expand sales.
    At present, the entire system is continuing to deepen the competition on the basis of overfulfilling the October plan, ensuring the overfulfillment of the fourth quarter plan, in order to cooperate with the smooth completion of grain and cotton purchase work and meet the material needs of urban and rural people in the year of harvest.

    中国百货公司辽西省许多市县公司
    超额完成十月份销售计划
    中国百货公司辽西省公司全体职工响应增产节约号召，积极开展推销竞赛，到十月末已超额百分之六完成月份销售计划（占季度计划百分之三十点二四）。其中昌图、铁岭、四平、梨树、黑山、新民等十六个市县公司超过计划；锦西、兴城、开原等五县接近完成；仅绥中、锦县等三县较差。
    各市县公司领导上都认真贯彻了省增产节约会议精神，大部职工明确认识国营商业系统的增产节约应以扩大推销，保证市场供应，降低流转费用为目的。边讨论边行动，增产节约竞赛逐步深入。像铁岭县公司组织基层合作社主任、营业员参观仓库，签订了一百二十亿元的合同，占公司总销售计划百分之五十强；经理亲自掌握和检查组织货源的工作，克服运输中的困难，从沈阳直接进货，到月末已完成季度进货计划一半多，保证了物资充分供应；第一商店张来余小组内部分工明确，团结互助，态度好，又创造了“循环点货法”，巩固了清产成绩；第三商店鞋帽组与荣军中学联系好，都提前完成了小组计划，全县超额百分之六完成月份计划。昌图县百货公司与三十一个中心合作社签订了一百二十一亿元的具体品种合同，批发商店主任亲自到基层合作社帮助增加品种；营业员刘贵见到农民花高价到四平去买旧麻袋，便建议合作社经营麻袋，十天就卖给基层社五百条，满足了农民需要，超额百分之十九完成月份计划。四平市公司每旬评比一次循环红旗，又适当地扩大调整冬货摆设面积，第一商店的冬货由楼上移到楼下，同时还抽出八个同志到批发商店工作。梨树县公司行动早，抓住以配合购粮的重点为中心，深入基层合作社帮助改善经营管理，扩大品种，批发商店内部亦简化了手续制度，都先后提前完成月份计划。北镇县公司批发商店专人下乡帮助合作社推销，仅帮助闵甸子合作社卖布，即增加卖钱额一倍；黑山县公司新立屯商店缩短商品出库时间，便利合作社取货；北镇、法库等县还与合作社建立通讯关系，互通销售、库存情况；锦州市公司第五商店营业员闲时就四出找货主，至今仅文具组已建立固定顾主二十六户，因而都超额完成了十月份计划。就连黑山县公司赶大车的在运输工作中亦提出了“赶早不赶晚”的办法，晚间装车起早走，缩短运输时间，保证商品及时供应；新民县公司公主屯商店炊事员在做好职工伙食以外，还帮助扛布、卖棉花，为扩大推销而努力。
    目前全系统正在超额完成十月份计划的基础上，继续深入展开竞赛，保证超额完成四季度计划，以配合购粮、购棉工作顺利完成和满足丰收年景城乡人民的物资需要。　（陈际云、赵忠生）
