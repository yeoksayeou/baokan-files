Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th — The delegations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communiqué:

    The thirteenth meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held on November 16th.

      In accordance with the agreement on the agenda and discussion methods approved by both parties at the meeting on the 14th, both parties should first decide on the composition of the subcommittees and the agenda items to be discussed by each subcommittee separately. However, in his speech on the 16th, the U.S. representative, Dean, bypassed this procedure and directly entered into substantive discussions before the subcommittee was even established. Mr. Huang Hua, the representative of the People's Republic of China, pointed out that the U.S. side's move was inconsistent with the procedures agreed upon by both parties. The U.S. representative then interrupted his speech on substantive issues. Then, through negotiation between the two sides, it was agreed that a subcommittee composed of representatives from both sides would be established to discuss the first agenda item, namely the issue of the membership and location of the political conference; at the same time, personnel designated by representatives from both sides would establish another subcommittee to discuss the second agenda item, namely the issue of the timing of the political conference. Both subcommittees will meet tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. and conduct discussions simultaneously. Mr. Qi Shifu, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, specifically pointed out that proposals from both sides regarding the membership, location, and timing of the political conference should be formally discussed at tomorrow's subcommittee meeting. The meeting was then adjourned.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈取得协议
    成立两个小组委员会分别讨论头两项议程
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月十六日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十三次会议。
      按照双方代表十四日会议批准的关于议程与讨论方法的协议，双方应首先决定组成小组委员会及各小组委员会分别进行讨论的议程项目。但美方代表迪安在十六日发言时，竟越过此种程序，在小组委员会尚未成立前，即迳直进入了实质的讨论。中华人民共和国代表黄华先生指出：美方此举与双方协议的程序不符。美方代表始中断了关于实质问题的发言。然后，经双方协议：由双方代表组成一个小组委员会，讨论第一项议程，即政治会议的成员问题与地点问题；同时，由双方代表指定人员成立另一小组委员会，讨论第二项议程，即政治会议的时间问题。两个小组委员会均将于明日上午十一时开会，同时进行讨论。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生特别指出：双方关于政治会议的成员、地点及时间问题的建议，均应在明日小组委员会上正式开始讨论。会议至此休会。
