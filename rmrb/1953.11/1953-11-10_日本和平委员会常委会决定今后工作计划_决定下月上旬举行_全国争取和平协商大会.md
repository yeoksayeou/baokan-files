   Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Japan Peace Committee held a meeting of its Standing Committee in Tokyo on October 28th. The meeting, in accordance with the new direction for the Japanese peace movement determined by the 8th National Congress of the Japan Peace Committee, decided on the future work plan.
    The Standing Committee meeting decided to draft a report on the Japanese peace movement to be submitted to the World Peace Council meeting scheduled to be held at the end of November. The meeting also decided that the report will focus on the conspiracy of the American and Japanese warmongering groups to revive Japanese militarism, especially the suffering that the Yoshida government's acceptance of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency's "aid" to carry out large-scale rearmament will cause to the Japanese people, as well as the Japanese people's opposition to rearmament and the situation of the peace movement. The meeting decided to change the "National Conference for Peace Negotiations," originally scheduled for November 28th and 29th, to December 8th and 9th. This conference will focus on demanding the establishment of normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, the convening of a five-power peace conference, the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and the implementation of international consultations. In addition, the meeting decided to launch a petition movement to the Diet, promote the realization of inviting delegations from the Chinese Red Cross and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan, strive for the freedom for Japanese people's organizations to visit China, Korea, and the Soviet Union, expose the Yoshida government's conspiracy to rearm, and prepare to publish booklets to enable the people of the whole country to understand the truth.
    The Standing Committee also decided: to prepare for a rally to welcome Professor Ikuo Oyama's return home after receiving the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations"; to publish a commemorative collection of essays on Ikuo Oyama receiving the prize and a commemorative collection of essays such as "History of the Japanese Anti-War Peace Movement - The Path of Ikuo Oyama"; to hold a peace art exhibition, to select "Atomic Bomb Painting" by Akamatsu Toshiko and Maruki Toshi for the World Peace Council's exhibition of Peace Prize-winning works to be held in Budapest at the end of this year, and to select more representative works to participate in the peace art exhibition to be held in Copenhagen from the end of this year to the spring of next year, etc.
