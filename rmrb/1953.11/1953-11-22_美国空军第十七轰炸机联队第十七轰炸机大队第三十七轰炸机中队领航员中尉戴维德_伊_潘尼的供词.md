    Confession of Lieutenant David E. Penny, Navigator of the 37th Bombardment Squadron, 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force
    My name is David E. Penny, Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-729654. I came to Korea on March 1, 1952, stationed at K-9 Air Base near Busan, serving as a navigator on B-26 aircraft in the 37th Bombardment Squadron, 17th Bombardment Group, 17th Bombardment Wing. I originally joined the Air Force in 1941 and was commissioned as an officer in 1942. After serving four and a half years in World War II, I returned home. I was recalled to active duty in July 1951 and, after a period of training at Ellington Air Force Base and Randalph Air Force Base in August and September 1951, I was transferred to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. After arriving there on October 10, 1951, I began combat flight training on B-26 aircraft. My home is in Klamath Falls, Oregon. I am currently 35 years old, married, and have one child.
    My primary duty is navigation—the main method being pilotage, so we are called pilotage navigators in the flight crew. After my sixth mission, I began flying with Pilot Officer Crow and Bombardier Officer Johnson.
    We had been accurately executing our missions according to group briefings. Until mid-April, when I was on my 15th mission, Officer Crow gave me a slip of paper with coordinates on it, saying we had to fly there and drop the bombs under the wings—special bombs. The location was a place west of Sandong. Around April 19, 1952, our plane took off from base and arrived over the target area at about 21:30. Officer Crow flew very low and dropped the bombs, but none of them exploded. Upon landing, he said: Report these bombs as non-exploding bombs, the outcome is unknown, and don't talk about this to anyone in our barracks.
    Around April 21, 1952, our flight crew, Pilot Officer Crow and Bombardier Officer Johnson, went on another flight mission together. At about 21:00, when we were next to the plane, Officer Crow told Officer Johnson and me that the four bombs on the wings were special bombs and were to be dropped near Kangdong. He gave me a paper with coordinates on it and explained the bombing procedure to Officer Johnson. We first flew over the target, dropped the bombs, but there was no explosion. Upon landing, Officer Crow said: Report these bombs as non-exploding bombs.
    Around April 24, 1952, our flight crew reported in front of the plane, and Officer Crow said: Tonight's mission will have four special bombs like before on our wings. Because we had flown two such missions, we flew without delay to a target near Sandong and dropped the bombs on the wings. Again, there was no explosion, and we reported them as non-exploding bombs.
    Around noon on April 25, 1952, my pilot, Officer Crow, told me that our flight crew had to attend a special lecture that day at 14:00 and that it was mandatory. He said: This lecture is specifically for flight crews that have completed more than twenty missions. The lecture is related to the special missions we have already carried out three times.
    Our flight crew, including Pilot Officer Crow, Navigator and Bombardier Officer Johnson, and myself, went to the ground school classroom at 14:00. There were about seven or eight flight crews from our squadron present. Each flight crew was represented by three flying officers; none of those present were soldiers.
    Captain Jackson, the Squadron Operations Officer, spoke to us first. His words were roughly as follows: "Some of you have previously been ordered to carry out special missions and drop special bombs. Those missions were experimental in the past. We now have more new aircraft, and the requirements of the Fifth Air Force have increased. Some of you here have not yet carried out such missions, but you will be doing so in the coming weeks. The rest of the squadron will also be carrying out these types of missions after they have flown a few more missions."
      "These special bombs are mounted on your wings. If they have already been installed, don't touch them. If the loading crew is installing the bombs, don't approach the plane until they have finished. Inspect your aircraft, and if for some reason you cannot take off, you must notify the squadron so that it can send the loading crew to unload the bombs."
      "If, when you are over North Korea, for some reason, you cannot drop your bombs, you should fly to the east coast and return over the ocean. When flying over Busan, you should make every effort to drop the bombs into the sea to the south."
      Captain Jackson also implied that the substance in the bombs was lethal to Chinese and North Korean troops, but our troops were protected.
    Then, a Battalion Assistant Intelligence Officer spoke to us. He said that every point discussed here was top secret, not even to be told to our fellow officer colleagues. He emphasized that even among ourselves, we were not allowed to discuss this in our barracks or in the club. Finally, he emphasized that we must maintain secrecy because Battalion Commander Colonel Kamp had said that he would deal very severely with those who talked about this.
      Then, Captain Jackson spoke again, saying: Although some of you may not want to carry out these special missions and would rather carry out normal missions, these missions still have to be carried out by all pilots. Among the soldiers, these missions are called "Squadron Project Missions." In conclusion, he reminded us again that it was not permitted to talk outside this classroom.
      Around April 28, 1952, that is, the third day after Squadron Operations Officer Captain Jackson lectured on the "Squadron Project Mission" procedures, our flight crew was assigned to carry out a "Squadron Project Mission."
    Officer Crow said: Our procedure will be the same as last time, but the target is the river that passes southwest of Singye.
    I asked Officer Crow if he knew why we were not bombing vehicles, etc., according to normal procedures, but were dropping our wing bombs into the river. He said that it was very secret, but since we were in the same flight crew, he was willing to tell us what he knew. He said: Captain Jackson had told him that these special bombs were germ bombs. Therefore, using these bombs would make the Chinese and Koreans sick and unable to continue the war. He warned us not to talk about this news again because it was highly secret.
    After we took off, we flew to the target near Singye and dropped our four germ bombs. There were no explosions; we reported them as non-exploding bombs.
    Shortly after this conversation with Officer Crow, I rode in a car with Major Thompson, the 34th Squadron Commander, on the base. Since there was no one else in his jeep, I told him that I had learned from a very reliable source that we were carrying germ bombs under the guise of special bombs and asked him to explain the reason for this. He said: My information was correct, and it was an order from the Fifth Air Force that had to be carried out. Therefore, I really knew that the first three special missions and the "Squadron Project Mission" were all germ warfare missions, and the special bombs we dropped were germ bombs.
    Around May 7th, when we were getting on the plane, Major Friesen, our Group Briefing Officer, was also there, preparing to fly with us. Our plane had four germ bombs on the wings and six more in the bomb bay. We dropped the germ bombs in three locations in and near Suan, first south of Suan, then in Suan city, and finally northeast of Suan. After the mission was completed, Major Friesen said: We don't need to report; this mission, especially with him going along, is not to be told to anyone.
    Around May 16, 1952, Colonel Kamp, the commander of our group, also went along on our plane, and we dropped four germ bombs, with the target being near Suan.
    On May 24, 1952, I, along with Pilot Officer Gernow, Navigator and Bombardier Hammer, carried out a "Squadron Project Mission." In front of the plane, Officer Gernow asked me if I had flown such a mission before. I said: I have carried it out; just tell me the bombing coordinates. The target location was a supply station near Suan. We first flew there and dropped four germ bombs. There was no explosion; they were called non-exploding bombs.
    I carried out a total of ten missions dropping germ bombs in North Korea. In addition to the seven described above, the other three were all in May 1952. The targets were water sources or food supply stations near Kangdong, Singye, Sandong, Suan, and Sinpyeong. Each time, four germ bombs were dropped.
    On July 7, 1952, our plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Sandong. Although our plane was one of the best in the squadron, it kept descending, and we had to parachute. Our flight crew, including Pilot Officer Gernow, Navigator and Bombardier Lieutenant Hammer, and myself, were captured by the Korean police.

    美国空军第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七轰炸机中队领航员中尉戴维德·伊·潘尼的供词
    我名叫戴维德·伊·潘尼，美国空军中尉，军号A O—729654，一九五二年三月一日来朝鲜，驻在釜山附近的K —9空军基地，担任第十七轰炸机联队第十七轰炸机大队第三十七轰炸机中队B —26型飞机的领航员。我原于一九四一年参加空军，并在一九四二年被委任为军官。我在第二次大战中服役四年半后复员回家。一九五一年七月被重召入伍，于一九五一年八、九月间在埃林顿空军基地与兰达尔福基地受训一个时期之后，即被调往弗吉尼亚州的兰莱空军基地。我在一九五一年十月十日到达该处后，即开始受B —26型飞机的战斗飞行组训练。我的家在俄勒冈州，克拉马斯瀑布。我现年三十五岁，已婚，有一个孩子。
    我的主要职务为领航——其主要方法为使用短航领航法，因此我们这种人在飞行组中被称为短航领航员，自执行第六次任务后，我开始和驾驶员柯劳欧尉官与轰炸手约翰逊尉官同飞。
    我们一直按照大队简令准确地执行着我们的任务。直到四月半以后，当我执行着我的第十五次任务时，柯劳欧尉官给我一张纸条，上载座标；并说我们须飞往该处，投下机翼下的炸弹——特殊炸弹。该处的位置为三登以西的一个地方。大约在一九五二年四月十九日，我们的飞机飞离基地并约于二十一时三十分飞临目标地区。柯劳欧尉官飞得很低，投下了炸弹，但并没有任何炸弹的爆炸。在着陆时，他说：汇报时称这些炸弹为不爆炸炸弹，结果不明，并且不要对我们宿舍中的任何人谈起这件事情。
    约在一九五二年四月二十一日，我们这个飞行组驾驶员柯劳欧尉官，轰炸手约翰逊尉官又一同去执行另一次飞行任务。约在二十一时，当我们在机旁时，柯劳欧尉官告诉约翰逊尉官和我说：机翼上四个炸弹是特殊炸弹，要把它们投于江东附近，他给我一张纸，上载座标，并向约翰逊尉官解释轰炸程序。我们首先飞临该目标，投下炸弹，但没有爆炸，在着陆时，柯劳欧尉官说：汇报时称这些炸弹为不爆炸炸弹。
    约在一九五二年四月二十四日，我们的飞行组在飞机前报到，柯劳欧尉官说：那晚的任务将有像以前一样的四枚特殊炸弹，在我们的机翼上。因为我们已飞过二次这样的任务，所以没有迟延，就飞到靠近三登附近的一个目标，投下机翼上的炸弹。这次仍然没有爆炸，我们汇报为不爆炸炸弹。
    约在一九五二年四月二十五日的中午时分，我的驾驶员柯劳欧尉官对我说：当天十四时我们的飞行组都要去听一次特殊课，而且非去不可。他说：这课是专给已执行过二十次以上的任务的飞行组讲的。讲课和我们已执行过三次的那类特殊任务有关。
    我们的飞行组，包括驾驶员柯劳欧尉官，领航员和轰炸手约翰逊尉官和我，在十四时到地面学校的教室中去。约有七、八个我们中队里的飞行组也在场。每一飞行组由三个飞行的军官作代表，在场的没有一个是士兵。
    中队作战官杰克逊上尉首先对我们讲话。他的话大体上是这样的：“你们中间的某些人在以前曾受命执行过特殊任务，投掷特殊炸弹。那些任务在过去是试验性的。我们现在有了更多的新飞机，第五航空队的要求也提高了。这里的人有些还未执行过这样的任务，但你们在以后的数周中也会要这样做的。本中队的其余人员，一俟他们再执行过几次任务后也将要执行这类任务。”
      “这些特殊炸弹装在你们的机翼上。如他们已被安装好，你们就不要再去碰他们了。如装弹组正在安装炸弹，在他们装完之前，不要走近飞机。检查你们的飞机，如因某种原因你们不能起飞，你们须通知中队，让它派装弹组去把炸弹卸下。”
      “如当你们在北朝鲜上空时，因某种原因，你们的炸弹丢不下去，你们便应飞往东海岸，在海洋上空返航。在飞临釜山时，应尽一切努力设法把弹丢在南面的海中。”
      杰克逊上尉并暗示说：弹中物质对中国军队与北朝鲜军队是致命的，但我们的部队则已受到保护。
    随后，一个大队助理情报官向我们讲话。他说：在此所谈的每一点都是绝密的，甚至于不许告诉我们的那些军官同事。他着重指出：就是在我们自己之间也不许在我们的宿舍里或在俱乐部里谈论此事。末了，他着重的说：一定要保守机密，因为大队长坎普上校已说过，对那些谈论此事的人，他要非常严厉对付他们。
      于是，杰克逊上尉又讲话了，他说：尽管我们之间有些人不愿执行这种特殊任务而宁愿执行正常的任务，但这种任务还是要全体飞行员去干的。在士兵们中间，就把这种任务称为“中队计划任务”。结尾时，他再度提醒我们在这教室外谈论是不许可的。
      约在一九五二年四月二十八日，亦即中队作战官杰克逊上尉讲课说明“中队计划任务”程序后的第三天，我们这一飞行组被指定执行一次“中队计划任务”。
    柯劳欧尉官说：我们的程序将和上几次一样，但是目标是在穿过新溪西南的河流。
    我问柯劳欧尉官是否知道我们为什么不按正常程序轰炸车辆等而投我们机翼炸弹于河中的道理，他说，那是十分秘密的，但是既然我们是同一飞行组的人员，他愿把他所知道的告诉我们。他说：杰克逊上尉曾经告诉他，这些特殊炸弹就是细菌弹。因此，使用这些炸弹就会使中国人和朝鲜人病倒因而不能继续这个战争。他警告我们说：不要再谈论这个消息，因为它是高度秘密的。
    我们起飞后，飞向新溪附近的目标投下了我们的四枚细菌弹。没有发生任何爆炸，我们汇报时称之为不爆炸炸弹。
    在我和柯劳欧尉官这次谈话后不久，我曾和第三十四中队长汤普逊少校在基地内同坐过一次车。既然在他的吉普上并无他人，我就对他说，我从一个非常可靠的方面获悉我们以特殊炸弹的名义携带细菌弹，并且请他解释一下此事的所以然。他说：我的消息是正确的，那是第五航空队的命令，必须予以执行。因此我确实知道了最初的三次特殊任务和“中队计划任务”都是细菌战任务，我们所投掷的特殊炸弹就是细菌弹。
    五月七日左右，当我们上飞机时，我们的大队简令官弗里生少校，也在那里，准备与我们一起飞行。我们的飞机在翼上装了四枚细菌弹，在弹舱中又装了六枚。我们把细菌弹分三次投在遂安和遂安附近的三个地点，最初投在遂安以南，其次投在遂安城里，最后投在遂安东北。任务完毕时，弗里生少校说：我们不用去汇报了，我们这次任务，特别是他也同去一节，不许告诉任何人。
    约在五月十六日左右，本大队的队长坎普上校也乘我们的飞机同去，我们投了四个细菌弹，目标是在遂安的附近。
    一九五二年五月二十四日，我与驾驶员耿诺、领航员和轰炸手汉麦，一起执行了一次“中队计划任务”。在飞机前，耿诺尉官问我有没有飞过这种任务，我说：曾执行过，只要把投弹的座标告诉我就行了。目标位置是在遂安附近的一个供应站，我们首先飞到那里，投下了四枚细菌弹。没有发生爆炸，它们被称为不爆炸的炸弹。
    我在北朝鲜共执行了十次投掷细菌弹的任务。除了上面叙述的七次以外，另外三次都在一九五二年五月份。目标是江东、新溪、三登、遂安和新坪等地区附近的水源或粮食供应站。每次投了四枚细菌弹。
    一九五二年七月七日，我们的飞机在三登附近被高射炮所击中。虽然我们的飞机是中队里最好的飞机之一，它仍一直下降，我们就不得不跳伞，我们的飞行组人员包括驾驶员耿诺尉官，领航员和轰炸手汉麦中尉及我自己被朝鲜警察俘获。
