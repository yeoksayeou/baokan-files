Throughout the Northeast, crops are now largely in the fields, and the mass movement to increase production and conserve grain has achieved initial success. Various localities have carefully harvested and threshed during the autumn harvest, and it is estimated that the region has increased its grain harvest by 150,000 to 200,000 tons. Rehe Province increased its harvest by more than 37,500 tons; Baicheng County in Heilongjiang Province, Fuyu and Panshi Counties in Jilin Province, Xinjin and Zhuanghe Counties in Liaodong Province, and Kaiyuan and Yi Counties in Liaoxi Province have, according to statistics, increased their harvest by more than 40,000 tons. Whether used to support national construction or improve people's livelihoods, this grain is of great significance. The grain harvested in Rehe Province is equivalent to the total output of 32,396 hectares of land last year, enough for 150,000 people to eat for a year; at market prices, it is worth 41.25 billion yuan; if used to develop animal husbandry, it could buy 412,500 sheep, an average of one sheep for every two households in the province.

To increase grain yields, farmers in various localities adopted various methods to promote early maturity of crops before harvesting. After the crops matured, harvesting began immediately. This year, due to the thick and strong stalks of the crops, the frequent lodging, and the wide sowing, harvesting was more labor-intensive than in previous years, and the possibility of damage from wind and grinding was high. In response to this situation, various localities took various measures to speed up harvesting. Farmers in the Second District of Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, under the slogan "Three Springs are not as busy as one Autumn; grain in hand is grain," got up early and worked late to harvest crops. Seven mutual aid teams in Yong'an Village started early, harnessed carts to the fields, and hauled two or three more loads of crops a day than in previous years; many mutual aid teams in Songjiang Province rationally organized labor and arranged the order of rotation, further accelerating the harvesting speed. The accelerated harvesting speed greatly shortened the harvesting period and reduced grain losses. Throughout the region, except for the northern part of Heilongjiang Province, where the harvesting period was only shortened by six or seven days due to the late season, the harvesting period was generally shortened by about ten days compared with previous years, and in some areas of Rehe Province, it was shortened by about fifteen days. The Denghanlin mutual aid team in Jianguo Village, Tenth District, Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, lost more than 500 kilograms of grain last year due to untimely and slow harvesting, causing the rice to fall and the soybeans to shatter. This year, the whole team completed harvesting twelve days earlier, and the grain did not suffer any losses.

During harvesting, various localities actively studied and improved harvesting techniques and methods. Farmers in Dongfeng, Hailong and other counties in Liaodong Province adopted the method of "picking the corn in the field and husking it at home" when stripping corn, reducing the loss of corn ears. When cutting sorghum, the vast majority first laid down the ears and then the roots to prevent grain from falling. Many farmers in Songjiang Province grabbed small handfuls of millet when cutting it, stacking them up as they cut to prevent grain from falling and geese from pecking at it. Many farmers in Heilongjiang Province cut soybeans in the morning or forenoon and ordinary crops in the afternoon to prevent soybean shattering. Many farmers also laid sacks when pinching sorghum. In Rongguang Village, Second District, Hailun County, twelve people laid sacks to pinch sorghum, and one person collected more than five kilograms of grain a day. This year, harvesting in most areas was more meticulous than in previous years, and crude phenomena such as "leaving horse ears," "leaving pig's joy," and losing ears and grains were rare, greatly increasing the harvest. In Bayan County, Songjiang, the harvest of more than 75,000 hectares of crops increased by more than 5,400 dan of grain, an average increase of more than seven sheng per hectare. Farmers also came up with various ways to reduce losses when transporting crops. In Songzhangzi Village, Chengguan District, Wudan County, Rehe, 68 vehicles were used to haul crops, all covered with straw mats, and more than 2,040 kilograms of grain were collected in five days.

To ensure that every grain returned home, women and children were generally mobilized to pick up crops in the fields after harvesting. According to incomplete statistics, women and children in Pingquan County picked up more than 1.2 million kilograms of grain; Fuyu County in Jilin Province mobilized more than 43,000 women and children to go to the fields and picked up more than 1.4 million kilograms of grain.

Now, threshing is being carried out everywhere, and research is continuing to improve threshing techniques and increase grain production.

### 秋收中细收细打提高收获量  东北全区多收近二十万吨粮

    秋收中细收细打提高收获量
    东北全区多收近二十万吨粮
    东北全区庄稼现在大部上场，群众性的增产节约粮食运动已经获得初步成绩。各地在秋收中细收细打，据初步估计全区多收了十五万到二十万吨粮食。热河省多收三万七千五百多吨；黑龙江省白城县，吉林省扶馀、磐石县，辽东省新金、庄河县，辽西省开原、义县等县据统计已多收四万多吨。这些粮食不论用于支援国家建设或改善人民生活，都具有重大意义。热河省多收获的粮食相当于去年三万二千三百九十六垧地的总产量，够十五万人吃一年；按市价可值四百一十二亿五千万元；如果用来发展牧畜业，可以买羊四十一万二千五百只，全省农民平均每两户就能增加一只羊。
    为提高粮食收获量，早在收割之前，各地农民就采取各种办法促使庄稼早熟。庄稼成熟后，马上开始收割。今年由于庄稼棵粗壮、倒伏多、宽播的多，收割比往年费工，遭受风磨等损害的可能性很大，根据这种情况，各地采取各种办法加快收割速度。黑龙江海伦县二区农民在“三春不如一秋忙，抢到手里才是粮”的口号下，起早贪黑地割庄稼，永安村有七个互助组起早套车下地，一天比往年多拉二三回庄稼；松江省很多互助组合理地组织劳动和安排轮割次序，更加快了收割速度。收割速度加快，大大地缩短了收割日期，减少了粮食的损失。全区除黑龙江省北部地区因季节较晚，收割日期仅缩短六七天外，一般都较往年缩短十天左右，热河省有的地区并缩短十五天左右。松江省桦川县十区建国村邓汉林互助组，去年因收割不及时和收的慢，稻子掉头，大豆炸粒，全组损失五百多斤粮食，今年全组提前十二天收割完，粮食没有遭受损失。
    在收割中，各地积极研究提高收割技术，改进了收割方法。辽东省东丰、海龙等县农民扒苞米时采用“地里下棒，家里扒窝”的办法，减少丢棒的损失，割高粱时，绝大部分是先放穗后放根，防止掉粒。松江省许多农民割谷子时抓小把，随割随着就码起来，以防掉粒和雁弹。黑龙江省很多农民为防止大豆炸粒，都在早晨或上午割大豆，下午割一般庄稼。很多农民在掐高粱时也铺了麻袋，海伦县二区光荣村有十二个人掐高粱铺麻袋，一个人一天就接五斤多粮食。今年大部分地区收割都比往年细致，“留马耳朵”、“留猪乐”，丢穗丢粒等粗糙现象很少，大大地提高了收获量。松江巴彦县在割七万五千多垧庄稼中，就增产五千四百多石粮食，平均每垧多收七升多。在拉地中农民们也想了各种办法来减少损失。热河乌丹县城关区宋杖子村六十八辆车拉庄稼，全铺上了草帘子，五天就多收二千零四十斤粮食。
    为了做到颗粒还家，割完地各地曾普遍发动妇女和儿童下地拣庄稼。据不完全统计，平泉县妇女、儿童共拣一百二十多万斤粮食；吉林扶馀县发动了四万三千多名妇女、儿童下地，拣了一百四十多万斤粮食。
    现在各地正普遍进行打场，继续研究提高打场技术，增产粮食。
