Xinhua News Agency, 12th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson stated on the 10th that he could not "forgive" U.S. Air Force POWs who faithfully confessed to the U.S.'s crimes of germ warfare during their captivity. Wilson angrily accused these airmen of "doing wrong" and violating their "obligations."

Wilson's statement proves that the U.S. authorities are increasingly annoyed because they simply cannot deny the large amount of accurate, detailed, and specific facts about U.S. germ warfare listed in the confessions of U.S. Air Force POWs. Although the ten repatriated U.S. Air Force POWs have already fabricated so-called "retractions" of their confessions under pressure from the U.S. military authorities, these "retractions" are clearly of no help whatsoever. The extremely embarrassed U.S. authorities are therefore preparing to further punish the Air Force POWs who violated their "obligations" and leaked the "top secret" of germ warfare.

    对美国空军战俘的细菌战供词越来越恼火了
    美国政府准备进一步迫害美国空军战俘
    【新华社十二日讯】据路透社华盛顿消息：美国国防部部长威尔逊十日发表谈话，表示不能“宽恕”在被俘期间忠实供认了美国进行细菌战罪行的美国空军战俘。威尔逊愤怒指责这些空军人员“做了坏事”，并且违反了他们的“义务”。
    威尔逊的谈话证明：由于根本无法抵赖美国空军战俘供词中所列举的关于美国进行细菌战的大量准确、详尽和具体的事实，美国当局已越来越恼火。已被遣返的十名美国空军战俘虽已在美国军事当局的威逼下捏造了推翻供状的所谓“誓言”，但是这些“誓言”显然完全无补于事。极端狼狈的美国当局因此准备对违反应负的“义务”而泄露了细菌战的“绝顶机密”的空军战俘们进一步开刀。
