The Lipol rotary kiln in the calcination workshop of the Northeast Third Cement Plant has, since its overhaul and restart on June 30th, created a new record by running continuously for 105 days (calculated by working days) and producing 53,536 tons of clinker by October 13th for the first time. The mechanical operation efficiency has increased by 17% compared to the same period last year. According to preliminary calculations, the increased production and savings are worth over 700 million yuan.

The rotary kiln is one of the main machines in a cement plant. If it malfunctions, it will directly affect the entire production. Therefore, ensuring the safe operation of the rotary kiln has become the central task of the entire plant. In the past, due to the lack of a complete responsibility system from overhaul to production, and the low technical level, the refractory bricks in the rotary kiln often fell off, and other failures occurred. According to statistics, in 1952, there were 21 shutdowns due to refractory brick shedding and other failures, totaling more than 600 hours, equivalent to more than 20 days of no production. This situation did not improve until January this year. In January, in addition to the planned overhaul for three days, the plant was forced to shut down three times due to refractory brick shedding, so the production task for January was not completed. Shutdown accidents directly threatened the completion of the annual plan and affected the workers' production morale. At that time, some workers said: "The rotary kiln often has accidents. Last year's task was not completed, and this year's plan has been increased again. There's no chance of success!"

The plant's regular major overhaul began in February. After discussion, the past practice of having both kiln operators and pelletizing workers participate in bricklaying in order to "shorten" the time was changed. It was decided that the bricklaying team would be responsible, which initially ensured the quality of bricklaying, thus enabling the rotary kiln to run continuously for 63 days, which began to build confidence among all employees.

However, to further extend the running time of the rotary kiln, the following three problems must be thoroughly solved: ensuring bricklaying quality, hanging the kiln skin well, and paying attention to operating techniques and mechanical maintenance. After identifying the above key issues, the leadership decided to start by strengthening the overhaul work in June, and the Party organization mobilized each Party member to ensure quality during the overhaul. Gai Xiquan, a Party member of the bricklaying team, was the first to respond to the Party's call. He used his brains and created the "no steps, no inverted bricks, no large gray seams" operation method in the bricklaying work, and the bricklaying quality was very good. The Party organization promptly summarized and promoted Gai Xiquan's operation method, thus ensuring the quality of all bricklaying in the rotary kiln.

Hanging the kiln skin well is also one of the important factors in extending the running time of the rotary kiln. In order to solve this problem, the plant leaders sent Shi Maochun, the director of the workshop, and Sun Qihua, the kiln operator, to the Xicun Cement Plant in Guangdong in May to learn advanced experience in hanging the kiln skin; on the other hand, they organized the plant's chemical technicians to improve the batching work. After Shi Maochun and Sun Qihua returned from Xicun, the leaders organized technical personnel to study together and make some improvements to the method of hanging the kiln skin at the Xicun Cement Plant, according to the different structure and equipment of the kiln. Therefore, when hanging the kiln skin after the major overhaul in June, in addition to following the experience of Xicun and implementing "strong burning and fast turning, layered and thin hanging," they also reduced the gas and used "water cooling" to reduce the temperature of the kiln body and accelerate the bonding of the kiln skin, thus ensuring the quality of hanging the kiln skin.

In terms of technical operation and mechanical maintenance, the plant leaders also took many specific measures. Here, first of all, the Party organization unswervingly broke the skepticism among the employees and conscientiously implemented the Soviet experts' suggestions on "fast rotary kiln" and the use of "water cooling" to protect the kiln skin. In mid-July, the kiln operator raised the issue that the rotary kiln was difficult to burn. At that time, there were two conflicting opinions on how to solve the problem. The Party organization conducted theoretical analysis and on-site investigation, affirmed the solution of "fast rotary kiln," and organized the workshop to conduct a test, reducing the material layer from the original 190 mm to 180 mm, and the kiln became easier to burn. In terms of using "water cooling," since the enlarged meeting of the plant's employee representatives in mid-August put forward the slogan of "striving for safe operation of the rotary kiln for 100 days and continuous production of 51,000 tons of clinker," the workers paid more attention to protecting the machine. Whether day or night, someone was always patrolling around the rotary kiln. In order to accurately grasp the temperature of the kiln body, they often adjusted the water volume according to the kiln temperature to protect the kiln skin.

The Third Cement Plant learned from the advanced experience of the Xicun Cement Plant and conscientiously implemented the experts' suggestions, which extended the running time of the rotary kiln, thus ensuring the completion of the national plan and the increase production and savings plan from January to September. In order to further improve the operating rate of the equipment and maintain the life of the machinery, the plant conducted a regular overhaul in the calcination workshop from October 13th to 17th. At present, all employees are working hard to ensure the safe operation of the rotary kiln in 1953 and overfulfill the annual national plan and the increase production and savings plan.

    东北第三水泥厂学习先进经验
    回转窑连续运转一百零五天
    东北第三水泥厂烧成车间的立波尔式回转窑，从六月三十日大检修完毕开车以来，到十月十三日为止，第一次创造了连续运转一百零五天（以工作日计算），连续生产五万三千五百三十六吨烧块的新纪录，机械运转效率较去年同期提高了百分之十七，据初步计算，增产节约价值七亿多万元。
    回转窑是水泥厂的主要机械之一，如果它一发生故障，就将直接影响整个生产。因此如何保证回转窑的安全运转，就成了全厂的中心课题。过去由于从检修到生产都缺乏一套完整的责任制度，技术水平也很低，回转窑经常发生耐火砖脱落的现象和其它故障。据统计，一九五二年曾因耐火砖脱落及其它故障停车二十一次，总共有六百多小时，等于二十多天没有生产。这一情况，直到今年一月份仍没有好转，一月份除计划检修三天外，又因耐火砖脱落被迫停车三次，以致一月份没完成生产任务。停车事故直接威胁着全年年度计划的完成，也影响了工人的生产情绪。当时有的工人说：“回转窑老出事故，去年任务都没完成，今年计划又提高了，哪还有个门（没有把握的意思）！”
    二月份全厂定期性的大检修开始了，当时经过大家讨论，改变了过去为了“缩短”点时间，不管是看火工人，也不管是成球工人，都参加镶砖的作法，确定由瓦工组负责，初步保证了镶砖质量，因而使回转窑连续运转了六十三天，开始给全体职工树立了信心。
    但是，要进一步延长回转窑的运转时间，就必须彻底解决以下三个问题：保证镶砖质量，挂好窑皮，注意操作技术和机械维护。在找出上述关键问题之后，领导上就决定从加强六月份的检修工作着手，并由党的组织发动每个党员在检修中保证质量。瓦工组的党员盖锡全，首先响应了党的号召，他开动脑筋，在镶砖工作中创造了“不砌台阶，不砌倒砖，不砌大灰口”的操作方法，镶砖质量很好。党的组织及时总结和推广了盖锡全的操作方法，从而保证了回转窑全部镶砖的质量。
    挂好窑皮也是延长回转窑运转的重要因素之一。为了解决这个问题，该厂领导干部方面于今年五月份派出车间主任史茂春和看火工人孙启化到广东西村水泥厂学习挂窑皮的先进经验；一方面组织厂内化工技术人员改进配料工作。当史茂春和孙启化从西村学习完毕归来以后，领导上又组织技术人员根据窑的构造和设备不同，共同研究，把西村水泥厂的挂窑皮方法作了某些改进。因此，在六月份大检修完毕挂窑皮时，他们除按照西村的经验，实行
  “强烧快转，分层薄挂”外，又降低了瓦斯，并同时利用“水冷却”，降低了窑体的温度，加速了窑皮的粘结。从而保证了挂窑皮的质量。
    在技术操作和机械维护方面，该厂领导方面也采取了许多具体措施。这里，首先是党的组织坚定不移地打破了职工中的怀疑态度，切实地执行了苏联专家关于回转窑实行“快速转窑”和利用“水冷却”以保护窑皮的建议。七月中旬，看火工人提出了回转窑不好烧的问题。当时有两种解决问题的意见争论不休，党组织就进行了理论的分析和实地调查，肯定了符合“快速转窑”的解决问题的办法，并组织车间进行了一次试验，把料层由原来的一百九十粍减低至一百八十粍，结果好烧了。在利用“水冷却”方面，自从八月中旬全厂职工代表扩大会议提出“争取回转窑安全运转一百天，连续生产五万一千吨烧块”的口号以后，工人们更加注意保护机器。不论是白天黑夜，都时刻有人在回转窑周围巡回。为了准确地掌握窑体的温度，他们经常根据窑温来调剂水量，以保护窑皮。
    第三水泥厂学习西村水泥厂的先进经验，认真贯彻专家的建议，延长了回转窑的运转时间，因而保证了一至九月份国家计划和增产节约计划的完成。为了进一步地提高设备的运转率，并维护机械的寿命，该厂于十月十三日至十七日在烧成车间进行了定期检修。目前，全体职工正在为安全运转出一九五三年，超额完成全年国家计划和增产节约计划而努力。（童健华）
