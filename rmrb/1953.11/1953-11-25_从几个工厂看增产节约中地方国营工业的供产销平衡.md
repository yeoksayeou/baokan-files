    From Several Factories: Supply, Production, and Sales Balance of Local State-Owned Industry in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    By Our Correspondent Wang Xi
    In discussing and formulating plans for increasing production and practicing economy, most of the local state-owned factories in Tianjin encountered supply and sales problems; either there was insufficient raw material supply or the sales of products were not guaranteed. In the first half of this year, many factories failed to fully complete the state plan due to the impact of this problem. Although the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee organized supply, production, and sales balance meetings for major products in the first half of the year, it was difficult to eradicate the unplanned and anarchic state left over from old China's industry in a short period of time due to the small and scattered nature of local state-owned factories and the variety of products. If this problem is not solved first, launching an increase production and practice economy campaign will not only lose its conditions, but will also inevitably cause many new disconnections, resulting in a huge waste of national wealth.
    What are some ways to achieve supply, production, and sales balance in the drive to increase production and practice economy? What are some lessons learned? A glimpse of this can be seen from the situations of several factories.
    Actively Take the Initiative and Overcome Difficulties
    The Tianjin Local State-Owned Steel Rolling Mill did not fully utilize its equipment capacity due to insufficient supply of steel billets. Steel billets are materials distributed uniformly by the state. After the factory applied to the higher authorities, it did not sit idly waiting for the higher authorities to solve the problem, but actively searched for sources at the same time. Discovering that the Taiyuan Steel Plant had more than a thousand tons of substandard steel billets in stock, it actively sent people to Taiyuan through the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry to purchase the batch of steel billets and used it to produce wire rods, which not only solved the factory's production needs for the fourth quarter, but also solved the raw material problem for the wire factory.
    The main product of the Telecommunications Equipment Factory—electric welding machines—has always been largely distributed uniformly by the state, but the output in the fourth quarter could not be fully distributed and there was some backlog. According to the factory's production capacity and the requirements of the employees, a goal of increasing production by twenty units in the fourth quarter was proposed. Whether this hope can be realized depends on whether sales channels can be found. At this time, in addition to actively requesting the central competent department to find a solution, the factory's leadership also sent the head of the business section to Guangzhou, Hankou and other places to collect demand information. After preliminary contact with the state-owned trading departments in these places, these state-owned trading departments expressed their willingness to order or sell on consignment. The Guangzhou Materials Supply Department alone purchased one hundred units. This makes it possible to achieve the plan to increase the total output value by 2.4 billion yuan in the fourth quarter, and also opens the way for increased production next year.
    As long as the leading cadres of enterprises break away from the idea of ​​"stressing production and neglecting management" and mobilize the enthusiasm of management personnel to use their brains and overcome difficulties, many supply and sales problems can be easily solved. This principle can be further proved by the opposite situation: The tannery used by the Tianjin Jinan Tannery (joint state-private) for tanning leather in the vegetable tanning workshop has always used well-known brands. Since September, the Tianjin Company of China Chemical Raw Materials Company has been unable to supply them according to their needs due to a shortage of goods, and suggested that they change to other brands or use artificial tanning glue instead. They emphasized that this would affect the quality and color of the leather and did not accept this suggestion. They repeatedly negotiated with the Chemical Raw Materials Company, complaining that the company "has goods but does not give them". In fact, as long as the operating method is slightly changed, the quality and color of the leather can still be guaranteed by using artificial tanning glue or mixing it with other brands of tanning glue, as has been proven by the small-scale test recently conducted by the factory. Yongming Paint Factory (joint state-private) also uses old brands for the dyestuffs oil red and silver paste lithopone it needs, so it often feels threatened by insufficient raw material supply. Despite this, the factory is still obsessed with the high quality of imported goods and is unwilling to try domestic products. For example, oil red, lithopone, etc. are all domestic products, especially oil red, which is produced by Tianjin Lijin Dyestuff Factory. Although the quality is not as good as imported goods, it can be used to manufacture paint for oil brushing certain buildings. However, the factory has consistently refused to use it.
    One of the conditions and principles for the development of local industry should be "using local materials," but the above two factories only pursue "famous brand" raw materials. When there are difficulties in the supply of raw materials, they do not mobilize the vast number of employees to actively study and change to domestic products or sources. Raw materials that are more readily available and can be used. This practice of unwillingness to actively overcome difficulties will actually block the road to production development.
      Combining with State-Owned Trading Departments and Facing the Market
    The First, Second, and Third Tianjin Local State-Owned Wire Factories have always been producing according to sales because of the sluggish sales of their products. After the two factories proposed a predetermined goal of increasing the production of lead wire by 2,148 tons and iron yarn by 429 pieces to increase the national output value by 6.2 billion yuan based on the supply of raw materials and production capacity, they found the Tianjin Purchasing Station of the Hardware and Machinery Company to jointly study sales issues. The latter also expanded its acquisition plan based on the plans proposed by the two factories, increasing the acquisition plan for the fourth quarter by 4,000 tons, and found owners for this batch of lead wire in Jinan, Qingdao, Nanchang and other places. The wire factory also accepted the purchasing station's production plan to increase the output of coarse and fine lead wire according to the requirements of the ordering party to meet market needs. The two parties smoothly signed a contract for guaranteed sales and guaranteed purchases.
    In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, state-owned trading departments must not only complete their purchasing and sales plans, break away from conservative thinking, proactively understand the needs of the market and industrial enterprises, actively organize purchases, and guide the variety and specifications of local industrial production, urging them to improve quality; at the same time, they must also actively open up sales channels for products and support production. In this way, state-owned trading departments will play a huge role in communicating production and sales and promoting balance.
    Improving Enterprise Management and Improving Quality is the Fundamental Key
    The cause of supply, production and sales imbalance is often due to problems in the production link. For example, the quality of products is low, resulting in poor sales; the cost is too high, and no one cares about the products; for example, due to poor production management, even if there is a sales contract, orders cannot be delivered on time. In this type of situation, the problem of balance must be fundamentally solved by improving production management. One of the important reasons for the sluggish sales of electric welding machines produced by the Telecommunications Equipment Factory is the poor quality of the products. Users report that there are three major shortcomings: too high "temperature rise" (it gets hot in less than an hour), poor insulation, and insufficient output. After launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the factory leadership mobilized workers, technicians, and inspectors to jointly study and correct these shortcomings, and has achieved significant results, and sales have opened up.
    The Local State-Owned Knitting Factory signed a sales contract with the Tianjin Purchasing Station of China Department Store Company in June this year. Due to the factory's chaotic production management, production was not arranged in accordance with the contract requirements, so that it was unable to deliver goods in accordance with the specifications and quality stipulated in the contract. In June, 135 kinds of products that should have been produced according to the contract were not produced, while 142 kinds of products outside the plan were produced. As of the end of July, a total of more than 40,000 dozens of fleece underwear orders owed to the Tianjin Purchasing Station of China Department Store Company and cooperatives, while the factory simultaneously accumulated more than 40,000 dozens of products that did not meet the requirements due to color, size, etc., resulting in a large amount of capital backlog, and "will suffer a large amount of fines" for failure to perform the contract. At the same time, it more seriously disrupted the supply plan of department stores. After launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the factory proposed a plan to increase the production of 87,000 dozens of fleece shirts and trousers and 100,000 kilograms of Yongzi velvet. The Tianjin Purchasing Station of China Department Store Company has agreed to guarantee sales. Although the factory's production situation has improved recently, how to completely reverse the chaotic production situation, ensure the completion of the production plan, and deliver goods on time and in accordance with the requirements of the contract is still a serious effort for the factory. Otherwise, the increased production will inevitably cause a more serious phenomenon of production and sales disconnection.

    从几个工厂看增产节约中地方国营工业的供产销平衡
    本报记者　汪溪
    天津市地方国营工厂，在讨论制订增产节约计划时，大部都碰上了供销问题；不是原材料供应不足就是产品销路没有保证。今年上半年，有不少工厂因为这个问题的影响没能全面地完成国家计划。上半年虽曾在市财政经济委员会领导下，对主要产品，通过供产销平衡会议，进行了平衡，但因地方国营工厂小而分散、产品繁多，旧中国工业遗留下来的无计划无政府状态，难于在短期间内根除。开展增产节约竞赛，如不首先解决这个问题，不仅将使增产节约失去了条件，而且势必造成许多新的脱节现象，给国家浪费巨大财富。
    达到在增产节约中的供产销平衡，有些什么途径？有些什么教训？可从几个厂的情况看出其一二。
    积极主动，克服困难
    天津地方国营轧钢厂因钢胚供应不足，设备能力没有充分发挥。钢胚是由国家统一分配的物资。该厂向上级作了申请后，并没有坐待上级机关解决，而是同时主动地寻找来源。发现了太原钢厂存有千余吨不合规格的钢胚积压着，便积极通过中央重工业部派人到了太原，购买了这批钢胚，用它生产盘条，不仅可以解决本厂第四季度生产的需要，并且它的产品也连带着给铁丝厂解决了原料问题。
    电讯器材厂的主要产品——电焊机，一向大部是由国家统一分配，但第四季度产量未能全部分配出去，有一些积压。根据该厂的生产能力，职工群众的要求，提出了在第四季度增产二十台的目标。能不能实现这个希望，就要看能否找到销路。这时，厂的领导方面除积极请求中央主管部门设法解决外，同时派出了经营科长到广州、汉口等地去收集需要情况，经初步和这些地方的国营贸易部门联系后，这些国营贸易部门都表示愿意订购或代销，只广州一个器材供应部门就买了一百台。这就使第四季度增产总值二十四亿元的计划可以实现了，而且还为明年增产打开了道路。
    只要企业领导干部打破“重生产、轻经营”的思想，并发动经营人员的积极性，开动脑筋，排除困难，许多供销上的难题是可以迎刃而解的。这个道理更可从与上述相反的情况得到证明：天津津南制革厂（公私合营）植鞣车间鞣制皮革所用的烤胶，一向都用名牌货。九月份以来，中国化工原料公司天津市公司因货缺不能照它们的需要供应了，向它们提出了改用其他牌子或用人造烤胶代替的意见。它们却强调将影响皮革质量和色气而不采纳这个意见，并且往返地同化工原料公司交涉多次，喋喋不休，指责该公司“有货不给”。其实采用人造烤胶或和其他牌烤胶混合使用，只要在操作方法上稍加改变，仍可保证皮革的质量和色气，这已由该厂最近进行的小型试验所证明了。永明油漆厂（公私合营）所需染料油红、银浆立德粉等，也都是用老牌货，因而经常感受到原料供应不足的威胁。尽管如此，该厂仍迷恋于进口货质量高，不愿试用国产品。譬如油红、立德粉等都有国产品，特别是油红，天津利津染料厂就有出品，虽然质量比不上进口货，但可用以制造供油刷某些建筑物的油漆。可是该厂一直拒绝采用。
    地方工业发展的一个条件和原则应是“就地取材”，但上述二厂只追求“名牌货”的原料，在原料供应有困难时，不去发动广大职工积极钻研，改用国产品或来源较畅可资利用的原料。这种不愿积极克服困难的做法，实际上将是自己堵塞生产发展的道路。
      结合国营贸易部门，面向市场
    地方国营第一、二、三铁丝厂因产品销路不畅，一直是以销定产的。该两厂根据原材料供应情况和生产能力，提出了增产铅丝二千一百四十八吨、铁纱四百二十九匹为国家增加产值六十二亿元的预定目标后，即找五金机械公司天津采购站，共同研究销路问题。后者也根据该两厂提出的计划，扩大了收购计划，把第四季度收购计划增加了四千吨，并在济南、青岛、南昌等地为这批铅丝找到了货主。铁丝厂并根据订货方面的要求，接受采购站的增加粗号和细号铅丝的产量计划，以适应市场的需要。双方顺利地签订了包销包购合同。
    国营贸易部门在增产节约竞赛中，不仅要完成其购销计划，打破保守思想，主动了解市场和工业企业的需要，积极地组织收购，并指导地方工业生产的品种规格，督促其改进质量；同时，又积极地为产品打开销路，扶植生产，这样，国营贸易部门就将在沟通产销，推动平衡上发挥其巨大的作用。
    改进企业管理，提高质量是根本的关键
    造成供产销不平衡的原因，往往也由于生产环节上面出毛病，譬如：产品质量低，因而销路不畅；成本太高，产品无人问津；譬如因生产管理不善，虽有包销合同，却不能按期交订货。在这类情况下，必须根本上从改进生产管理着手解决平衡问题。电讯器材厂所产电焊机销路不畅，其中一个重要原因是产品质量不好，用户反映有“温升”太高（用不到一小时就发热）绝缘不好，出力不足等三大缺点。开展增产节约竞赛后，该厂领导方面即发动工人和技术人员、检验人员共同研究改正这些缺点，已有了显著成效，销路也就打开了。
    地方国营针织厂在今年六月曾和中国百货公司天津采购站签订了包销合同。由于该厂生产管理混乱，没有按照合同要求安排生产，以致一直不能按合同规定的规格、质量交货。六月份，按合同应生产的产品，有一百三十五种没有生产，而在计划外的产品则生产了一百四十二种。截至七月底止，共欠交中国百货公司天津采购站和合作社的绒衣订货四万余打，而工厂同时却积压了因颜色、尺码等不合要求的产品四万余打，造成大量资金积压，又因未履行合同“还要遭受大量罚款”，同时更严重地破坏了百货公司的供应计划。开展增产节约竞赛以后，该厂又提出了增产绒衣裤八万七千打，甬子绒十万公斤的计划。中国百货公司天津采购站已同意了包销。最近，该厂生产情况虽已有好转，但如何彻底扭转生产混乱的局面，保证生产计划的完成，并按期按合同的要求交货，对该厂来说，仍是需要严重努力的，否则必然因增产而造成更严重的产销脱节现象。
