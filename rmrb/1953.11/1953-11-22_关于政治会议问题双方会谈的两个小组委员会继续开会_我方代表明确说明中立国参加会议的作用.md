(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 20th) The delegations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

November 20th, the two subcommittees of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue held their fourth meeting.

In the subcommittee on the issue of members and location, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke first, refuting the absurd arguments of the American representative who slandered neutral countries such as the Soviet Union, and exposing the American side's unreasonable refusal to allow neutral countries to participate in the political conference, and its deliberate attempt to delay the political conference.

Mr. Ki Sok-bok pointed out: In the meeting on November 19th, the US side did not hesitate to arbitrarily insult and slander neutral countries such as the Soviet Union in order to cover up its unreasonable position of opposing the participation of neutral countries in the political conference. It is known to all that the Soviet Union is a neutral country outside the two warring parties in Korea and has consistently strived for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; and it goes without saying that Asian neutral countries should participate in the Korean political conference, which is primarily related to Asian peace. However, the US side even attempted to deny the fact that the Soviet Union is a neutral country, and shamelessly compared its military base Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan with neutral countries such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma. This is an insult to neutral countries and can only prove that the US side has run out of arguments in the face of our reasonable proposal. Subsequently, Mr. Ki Sok-bok once again explained the rationality of our three-point proposal, and in order to promote the early convening of the political conference, requested the other party to study and accept our proposal.

The American representative Dean, in his speech, in addition to continuing to slander the Soviet Union and deliberately distorting our proposal of November 17, fabricated some unfounded assumptions and questions, requesting our side to answer them, without putting forward any constructive opinions.

Mr. Ki Sok-bok immediately refuted again, clearly informing the other party that precisely because the Soviet Union is a bastion of peace, all warmongers make it their business to slander the Soviet Union, but facts speak louder than words, and the Soviet Union's neutral status in the Korean War cannot be denied by anyone.

Mr. Ki Sok-bok further pointed out that our proposal is very clear, and the questions and assumptions raised by the other party based on distortion are untenable and therefore not worth answering.

Mr. Huang Hua, the representative of the People's Republic of China, spoke last, pointing out that the other party violated the agreement by not publishing the joint communique on the agreement on the agenda and discussion methods agreed upon by the representatives of both parties on November 14 in the form of a joint communique; and pointed out to the other party: This concerns the question of whether the agreement between the two parties is being observed, and it concerns the question of whether all future agreements have practical value as agreements. The other party is not allowed to arbitrarily violate this, and a protest was lodged with the other party, requesting the other party to reissue this joint communique. In the subcommittee discussing the second item on the agenda, the US side suggested that assuming the agreement on each item on the agenda is reached no later than December 1, the date of the political conference shall be no earlier than 28 days after the agreement on each item on the agenda and no later than 42 days after the agreement on each item on the agenda, otherwise the time for the political conference will not be determined. Our side immediately pointed out that the US side initially suggested that the political conference be held on December 15, but now it no longer counts, and its purpose is obviously to attempt to drag the bilateral talks past the date of explanation to prisoners of war, so as to further undermine the issue of prisoners of war. Our side does not see any other purpose for the other party's so-called new proposal other than deliberately delaying the political conference.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 21st) The delegations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

November 21st, the two subcommittees of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference held their fifth meeting.

In the subcommittee discussing the first item on the agenda, our representative Mr. Ki Sok-bok made a clear explanation of the role of neutral countries in participating in the political conference. He pointed out that the role of neutral countries in the political conference does not lie in their voting rights, but in providing useful opinions in the conference to promote agreement between the two parties. For example, if India moves in the political conference that foreign troops from both sides withdraw from Korea, and the DPRK and China agree, and the United States opposes, then what is the significance of voting in this situation? He also pointed out that although the solution of problems in the political conference must be agreed upon by both parties, the participation of neutral countries is still very necessary, because neutral countries can promote both parties to avoid deadlock and reach an agreement, and the influence of neutral countries on the spot can somewhat restrain the American representatives from acting shamelessly and absconding from the meeting as they did during the armistice negotiations, so that the meeting can avoid unnecessary delays. Because the purpose of neutral countries participating in the political conference is to promote agreement between the two parties and quickly resolve the Korean issue and other issues, neutral countries should participate in the political conference from the very beginning, and there is no question of holding the political conference in stages or levels.

In his speech, the US representative, in addition to continuing to adopt delaying tactics, raising some inexplicable questions about our proposal and making slanderous attacks on our side, did not have any new content. Our side immediately reprimanded him sternly and advised the other party to adopt a serious attitude and conduct serious discussions.

In the subcommittee discussing the second item on the agenda, our side pointed out that the other party's proposal to make the political conference conditional on reaching a final agreement on all agenda items by December 1, and to convene the political conference within 28 to 42 days after the final agreement on all agenda items, not only postpones the preparatory work for convening the political conference, but also renders the preliminary agreement on the time issue meaningless. This approach by the other party is clearly aimed at delaying, so our side advised the other party to abandon its unreasonable proposal and accept our practical and feasible proposal.

    关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会继续开会
    我方代表明确说明中立国参加会议的作用
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第四次会议。
    在成员与地点问题小组委员会中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生首先发言，驳斥了美国代表诬蔑苏联等中立国家的荒谬论调，并揭露了美方无理拒绝中立国参加政治会议，蓄意拖延政治会议的企图。
    奇石福先生指出：美方在十一月十九日会议中，不惜以对苏联等中立国任意侮辱和诬蔑的办法，来掩盖其反对中立国参加政治会议的无理立场。举世皆知，苏联是朝鲜交战双方以外的中立国家，一贯努力于朝鲜问题的和平解决；而亚洲中立国家之理应参加首先关系亚洲和平的朝鲜政治会议，是不言而喻的。但美方竟然企图否认苏联是中立国家的事实，并无耻地将其军事基地日本及台湾蒋匪与印度、印尼、巴基斯坦、缅甸等中立国家相提并论，这是对于中立国家的侮辱，只能证明美方在我方合理提案面前，已经理屈词穷而已。接着，奇石福先生再次说明我方三点建议的合理性，为了促成政治会议的早日召开，要求对方研究并接受我方建议。
    美方代表迪安发言，除继续对苏联进行诬蔑，并故意曲解我方十一月十七日建议，无中生有地拟定一些假设和问题，要求我方解答外，没有提出任何建设性的意见。
    奇石福先生当即再加驳斥，明告对方，正因为苏联是和平的堡垒，一切战争贩子才以诽谤苏联为能事，但事实胜于雄辩，苏联在朝鲜战争中的中立地位，是谁都否定不了的。
    奇石福先生又指出，我方建议非常清楚，对方根据曲解而提出的问题与假设，是不能成立的，因此不值得加以回答。
    中华人民共和国代表黄华先生最后发言，指出对方违反协议，未将十一月十四日双方代表同意的关于议程与讨论方法的协议的联合公报，以联合公报形式发表；向对方指出：这是有关双方协议是否被遵守的问题，是有关今后一切协议是否具有作为协议的实际价值的问题，不能容许对方任意破坏，并向对方提出抗议，要求对方补发此项联合公报。在讨论第二项议程的小组委员会中，美方建议假定各项议程的协议的达成不迟于十二月一日，则政治会议召开的日期为不早于各项议程达成协议后的二十八天，不迟于各项议程协议后的四十二天，否则即不确定政治会议召开的时间。我方当即指出，美方最初建议政治会议在十二月十五日召开，现在又不算数，其目的显然是企图将双方会议拖过战俘解释日期之后，以便在战俘问题上进一步进行破坏。我方看不出对方所谓新的建议，除去蓄意拖延政治会议而外，还有任何其他作用。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十一日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第五次会议。
    在讨论第一项议程的小组委员会中，我方代表奇石福先生就中立国参加政治会议的作用作了明确的说明。他指出中立国在政治会议中的作用不在于它们的表决权，而在于在会议中提供有益的意见，推动双方取得协议。举例说，假使印度在政治会议中动议双方外国军队从朝鲜撤出，朝中同意，美国反对，则在此情况下表决有何意义？他又指出，虽然在政治会议中问题的解决必须取得双方一致同意，中立国的参加仍然十分必要，因为中立国可以推动双方避免僵局，达成协议，而中立国在场所产生的影响，多少可以约束美国代表，不致像在停战谈判时那样撒赖、逃会，从而可使会议避免不必要的拖延，由于中立国参加政治会议的目的是在于推动双方取得协议，迅速解决朝鲜问题等问题，中立国自应从一开始就参加政治会议，根本谈不上分阶段或分级举行政治会议。
    美方代表在发言中除继续采取拖延手段，就我方建议提出一些莫名其妙的问题及对我方作诬蔑性的攻击以外，并无新的内容。我方当即加以严词斥责，劝告对方采取严肃的态度认真进行讨论。
    在讨论第二项议程的小组委员会中，我方指出对方所提以所有议程项目在十二月一日达成最后协议为条件，建议政治会议在所有议程项目最后协议后的二十八天至四十二天之内召开，不但使召开政治会议的准备工作向后推迟，而且使关于时间问题的初步协议毫无意义。对方此种做法，显然是旨在拖延，因此我方劝告对方放弃其不合理的建议而接受我方的切实可行的建议。
