    The US side's policy of sabotage by special agents is the main reason for the suspension
    Lou Bangyan
    Currently, due to the US side's promotion of a policy of sabotage by special agents, openly directing the Lee and Chiang special agents to carry out terrorist rule over our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and adopting various sabotage methods to obstruct the explanation work, the explanation work to the prisoners of war has been repeatedly suspended. This situation, on the one hand, shows the complete moral and political degradation of the United States, and the direct violation of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in law, and on the other hand, it also shows that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and each of its members are facing a serious test as to whether they can fairly act in accordance with their own scope of authority and the "detailed rules for explanation and visit work" they have published.
    Since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, the US side has intensified its efforts to send more special agents disguised as our captured personnel into the prisoner-of-war camps, directly directing them to use barbaric means such as beatings and even cutting open chests and digging out hearts to suppress our captured personnel's desire to express their wish to be repatriated. Today, the prisoner-of-war camp has become the world of special agents, where "an atmosphere of gloom and terror prevails" (General Thimayya's words), where there is only the terrorist rule of clubs, daggers and dungeons over everyone, where there is no possibility of the existence of free will—this is the lawless and sinful act done by the so-called "civilized" United States. As a result, the prisoner-of-war explanation work has been seriously damaged, and our captured personnel have suffered indescribable insults to their dignity and physical coercion and killing.
    It is obvious that the United States' sabotage policy of using special agents and gangsters to strictly control our captured personnel is part of the US ruling group's policy of using special agents to launch international provocations in order to oppose the easing of international tensions. The use of special agents to launch international provocations has happened in the past, but it has never been done so blatantly, systematically, and on such a large scale as it is now in the history of international relations. Chairman Malenkov said in his recent speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "Things have reached such a point that some American groups have elevated the subversive activities against the legitimate governments of sovereign states to the level of government policy. For this purpose, the US federal budget has allocated huge sums of money to collect bandits from the dregs of society who engage in subversive activities and send them to democratic countries to carry out sabotage activities. For this purpose, a set of government organizations has been established, specializing in launching international provocations one after another, and carrying out propaganda of force worship and hatred for peace-loving countries." Now, all the sinful acts are being carried out in broad daylight without any cover-up, so no one will doubt that the United States has repeatedly parachuted special agents in an attempt to carry out sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; no one will not deeply hate the fascist provocation carried out by the United States in June against the German Democratic Republic. The current terrorist rule and sabotage activities of the US special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are undoubtedly the same policy of the US reactionary forces expressed in different ways under different circumstances. However, this attempt of the US ruling group is in vain, just as the use of special agents to launch international provocations in other occasions has repeatedly suffered shameful failures. The people of the world clearly know that the US side's reckless acts of using special agents to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war is a direct and serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and its annexes "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work", which is absolutely not allowed in law, and also completely exposes the moral and political bankruptcy of the United States.
    This is one aspect of the problem.
    The other aspect of the problem is the serious test faced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and each of its members on whether they are loyal to their "scope of authority." The current situation is: the explanation work to the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated has encountered a great crisis due to the US side's policy of sabotage by special agents. How should the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, according to law within its scope of authority, deal with this violent action of the special agent organizations that prevents the prisoners of war from exercising their right to be repatriated?
    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unanimously passed a resolution on September 16 regarding the Indian Custodial Forces taking effective measures against terrorists, but because the Swiss member violated the decision he himself passed, groundlessly insisting on prohibiting the use of force "under any circumstances," this resolution could not be implemented, resulting in the fueling of the special agent organizations' and terrorists' sinful control over the prisoners of war. Taking effective measures of course includes taking necessary sanctions, because if the sinful control over the prisoners of war is not effectively stopped, then the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will be paralyzed, the prisoners of war's right to exercise their right to be repatriated will never be guaranteed, and the task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulated in Article 1 of the "Scope of Authority" is precisely "to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice." Therefore, taking effective measures to stop the terrorist rule of the US special agents over our captured personnel is fully in line with the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. We believe that the attitude taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Poland is upright and fair. It pointed out in its memorandum of November 4: "If it were not for the opposition of some members of the Repatriation Commission—including the Swiss representative—to taking sanctions against terrorists in accordance with the prisoner-of-war agreement and the rules established by the Repatriation Commission, the dark terrorist activities in the prisoner-of-war camps controlled by the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents would have been stopped long ago, and the explanation work could have been carried out normally. It must be pointed out that under this circumstance, the Swiss government's mention of the prohibition of the use of force in the Geneva Convention is completely unreasonable, and is actually an attempt to distort the true meaning of the Convention's provisions; it must also be pointed out that the Swiss representative's opposition to taking steps in the Repatriation Commission aimed at eliminating this sinful terrorist control is an act that openly contradicts the Geneva Convention, and is undoubtedly an act of sabotage against this Convention." We all know that the Geneva Convention does not stipulate that one must yield to the sinful terrorist activities of special agents on any point regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. Opposing taking effective measures to remove the special agent terrorists who have infiltrated the prisoner-of-war camps, thereby stopping the vicious atrocities of the special agent organizations, like the Swiss representative does, is surrendering to the terror of the Lee and Chiang special agents, it is depriving the good prisoners of war of the protection they deserve, it is failing to fulfill the legal authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and it is also contradicting the Geneva Convention and the general principles of human rights.
    On November 1st and 2nd, at our firm request, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission investigated the atrocity case of the US special agents murdering our captured personnel Zhang Zilong in the No. 28 camp. The conduct of this fair investigation completely bankrupted the US side's intimidation that the use of force would lead to riots. At the same time, it proved that taking effective measures can break the sinful rule of the US special agents. The facts clearly tell us that as long as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces fairly exercise their authority in accordance with the "Scope of Authority" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," and take effective measures against special agent control and sabotage activities, the smooth progress of the explanation work in the future should be guaranteed. In the investigation on these two days, the special agents initially dared to act recklessly, causing the first day's investigation work to be fruitless; but on the second day, because the Indian Custodial Forces took more effective necessary measures, the special agents' prestige was immediately hit, and the investigation work therefore achieved certain results. This is a good comparison. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces should learn a good lesson from this: only by resolutely taking effective measures to eliminate violence and bring peace to the good people can the "Scope of Authority" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work" be implemented more smoothly. For the sake of peace, for the sake of the humanitarian principles of international law, for the sake of implementing the Korean Armistice Agreement, and for the sake of maintaining the legal authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, all peace-loving people should resolutely support all fair and necessary measures taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to sanction sinful atrocities and eliminate all US special agents.
    This is another aspect of the problem.
    The US side's promotion of a policy of sabotage by special agents, directly directing special agent elements to carry out terrorist rule over prisoners of war, is the main reason that is hindering the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and causing the explanation work to be suspended at all times today. To make the future explanation work proceed smoothly, there is no other way than to eliminate the special agent elements in the camp and break the terrorist rule of the special agent elements. This is the unanimous call of all peace-loving and righteous people.

    美方的特务破坏政策是解释停顿的主要原因
    楼邦彦
    目前，由于美方推行特务破坏政策，公然指挥李、蒋特务在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营里对我方被俘人员进行恐怖统治，并采取各种破坏办法来阻挠解释工作，因此，对战俘的解释工作已经多次陷于停顿。这种情况，一方面说明美国在道义上、政治上的彻底堕落，和在法律上对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的直接违反，另一方面还说明中立国遣返委员会及其每一成员，在是否能公正地按照它本身的职权范围和它自己公布的“解释和访问工作细则”办事，正面临着严重的考验。
    自从中立国遣返委员会接管战俘以后，美方变本加厉地增派更多的特务冒充我方被俘人员混入战俘营，直接指挥他们用毒打甚至开膛挖心等野蛮手段，百般压制我方被俘人员表达要求遣返的愿望。今天，战俘营已变成了特务的天下，在那里，“充满阴郁和恐怖的气氛”（蒂迈雅将军语），在那里，只有木棍、匕首和地牢对一切人的恐怖统治，在那里，没有自由意志的存在可能——这就是所谓“文明”的美国一手干出来的无法无天的罪恶勾当。其结果，使战俘解释工作遭到了严重的破坏，我方被俘人员更遭受到了对尊严的无法形容的侮辱以及对人身的武力胁迫和残杀。
    很明显，美国的这种使用特务流氓来严密控制我方被俘人员的破坏政策，正是美国统治集团为着反对缓和国际紧张局势而进行的使用特务发动国际挑衅政策的一部分。使用特务发动国际挑衅行为的事，过去并非没有发生过，但是做得像现在那样露骨、有系统和大规模，却是国际关系史上还没有过的。马林科夫主席最近在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说中这样说道：“事情到了这样的地步：一些美国集团竟把对主权国家的合法政府进行的颠覆活动，提高到政府政策的水平。为了这个目的，美国联邦预算拨出了巨额款项，来从社会渣滓中搜罗从事颠覆活动的匪徒，把他们派到民主国家进行破坏活动。为了这个目的，建立了一套政府组织，专门一个接着一个地发动国际挑衅，进行武力崇拜和仇恨爱好和平国家的宣传。”现在，一切罪恶的勾当都毫无掩饰地在光天化日之下进行着，因此没有人再会怀疑美国屡次空降特务企图在苏联及人民民主国家进行破坏活动；没有人不深加痛恨美国雇佣特务在今年六月对德意志民主共和国进行的法西斯挑衅。而目前美方特务在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营中的恐怖统治和破坏活动，无疑地就是美国反动势力的同一个政策在不同情况下的不同方式的表现。然而，美国统治集团的这种企图是枉然的，正好像在其他场合使用特务发动国际挑衅行为已接连地遭到可耻的失败一样，全世界人民都清楚地知道，美方使用特务阻挠遣返战俘的胡作非为，是对朝鲜停战协定及其附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的直接的严重违反，在法律上是绝不允许的，而且在道义上、政治上也彻底暴露了美国的堕落破产。
    这是问题的一方面。
    问题的另一方面就是中立国遣返委员会及其每一成员，在是否忠于其“职权范围”这一点上所面临的严重考验。目前的情况是：对不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作，已因美方的特务破坏政策而遭遇到很大的危机。对于特务组织的这种致使战俘不能行使其被遣返权利的暴力行动，中立国遣返委员会依法在其职权范围内究应怎样来对待呢？
    中立国遣返委员会曾于九月十六日一致通过一项关于印度看管部队对恐怖分子采取有效措施的决定，但由于瑞士委员违反自己通过的这一决定，毫无根据地坚持禁止在“任何情况下”使用武力，致使这一决定不能被贯彻执行，结果就助长了特务组织与恐怖分子对战俘的罪恶控制。采取有效措施当然包括采取必要的制裁手段在内，因为对战俘的罪恶控制如不有效地加以制止，那末中立国遣返委员会就会陷于瘫痪状态，战俘行使其被遣返的权利就会永远得不到保证，而根据“职权范围”第一款所规定的中立国遣返委员会的任务，恰恰是“为保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。所以采取有效措施来制止美方特务对我方被俘人员的恐怖统治，是完全符合朝鲜停战协定和关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的。我们认为波兰人民共和国外交部所采取的态度是正直而又公道的。它在十一月四日的备忘录中指出：“如果不是由于遣返委员会中某些委员——其中有瑞士代表——反对按照遣俘协议和遣返委员会所订的规则来对恐怖分子采取制裁手段的话，李承晚和蒋介石特务所控制的战俘营中的暗无天日的恐怖活动早就得到了制止，解释工作也可以正常地进行了。必须指出，在这种情况之下，瑞士政府提到日内瓦公约中关于禁止使用武力的话是毫无理由的，实际上是企图曲解公约条文的真正意义；也必须指出，瑞士代表在遣返委员会上反对采取目的在于消除这种罪恶的恐怖控制的步骤，这是与日内瓦公约公开抵触的行为，无疑地也是破坏这个公约的行为。”我们都知道，日内瓦公约在关于战俘待遇的任何一点上，都并未规定要向罪恶的特务恐怖活动屈服。像瑞士代表那样地反对采取有效措施把混入战俘营的特务恐怖分子清除出去，从而制止特务组织的凶恶暴行，这就是向李、蒋特务的恐怖屈服，这就是剥夺善良战俘应得的保护，这就是不履行中立国遣返委员会的合法职权，这也就是抵触日内瓦公约和一般的人权原则。
    十一月一日、二日，中立国遣返委员会在我方的坚决要求下，对第二十八号营场的美方特务谋杀我方被俘人员张子龙的暴行案件进行了调查。这个公正调查的进行，使美方的所谓使用武力就要酿成暴乱的恫吓完全破产了。同时它又证明：采取有效措施是可以打破美方特务的罪恶统治的。事实清楚地告诉我们，只要中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队公正地按照“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”来行使职权，对特务控制和破坏活动采取有效措施，今后解释工作的顺利进行，是应该能够得到保证的。就在这两天的调查中，特务们起先还敢于横行，致使第一天的调查工作因而毫无结果；但第二天由于印度看管部队采取了较为有效的必要措施，特务们的威风当时就受到了打击，调查工作因而获得一定的结果。这是一个很好的对照。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队应该从这里获得良好的教训：只有坚决采取有效措施，除暴安良，才能使“职权范围”与“工作细则”比较顺利地实施。为了和平，为了国际公法的人道原则，为了实施朝鲜停战协定，为了维护中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的合法权力，所有爱好和平人民应坚决支持中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队为制裁罪恶暴行和清除全部美方特务的一切公正和必要的措施。
    这是问题的又一方面。
    美方推行特务破坏政策，直接指挥特务分子对战俘进行恐怖统治，这是今天阻碍中立国遣返委员会工作，使解释工作时时陷于停顿的最主要原因。要使今后的解释工作得能顺利地进行，除开清除营场中的特务分子，打破特务分子的恐怖统治，别无其他途径。这是一切爱好和平与正义的人士的一致呼声。
