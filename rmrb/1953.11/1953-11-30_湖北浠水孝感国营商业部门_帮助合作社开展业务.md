    Hubei Xishui Xiaogan State-Owned Commercial Departments
    Help Cooperatives Develop Business
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Xishui, Xiaogan, Xinzhou and other places in Hubei Province are closely integrated, expanding sales and developing cooperative business. In order to supply cooperatives with goods in a timely manner, Xiaogan and Xishui cotton yarn and cloth and department stores have transferred cadres and organized a number of mobile teams to frequently contact cooperatives and deliver goods to them. Among them, the Xishui cotton yarn and cloth store delivered 240 million yuan worth of goods to the cooperative in ten days, fully meeting the needs of the cooperative. Some grassroots cooperative cadres have some difficulties in their operations due to their unfamiliarity with business, and state-owned commercial departments have done their best to help solve them. For example, the Xiaogan Xuedian Cooperative felt that the variety of department store products was complex and it was not easy to prepare a purchase plan, so the cadres of the county department store helped the cooperative to study and solve this difficulty. Some cooperatives in Xinzhou were not clear about accounts and prices, so the cotton yarn and cloth store sent eight cadres to help the cooperatives solve these problems. Through these contacts and assistance, the cooperative business has been rapidly improved, the variety of goods operated has been greatly increased, and the turnover of state-owned commerce and cooperatives has been greatly increased accordingly.

    湖北浠水孝感国营商业部门
    帮助合作社开展业务
    湖北省浠水、孝感、新洲等地国营商业部门和合作社密切结合，扩大了推销，发展了合作社业务。为了及时供应合作社商品，孝感、浠水花纱布和百货商店都抽调干部，组织了一批流动小组，经常和合作社联系，给合作社送货。其中，浠水花纱布商店在十天内就向合作社送了二亿四千万元的商品，充分满足了合作社的需要。有些基层合作社的干部因为业务生疏，在经营上存在一些困难，国营商业部门都尽力帮助解决。比如，孝感薛店合作社感到百货品种复杂，不易编制进货计划，县百货商店的干部就帮助合作社研究，解决了这个困难。新洲有些合作社在账目、物价问题上不大清楚，花纱布商店就抽出八个干部到合作社帮助解决这些问题。通过这些联系和帮助，合作社业务很快改善，经营的商品品种大量增加，国营商业和合作社的营业额都随着大大提高。　（赵宗宣）
