    Record of the National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Conference
    Cheng Zhi
    The rich and colorful "National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Conference" victoriously concluded in Tianjin on November 12th. Three hundred and ninety-seven athletes representing ten ethnic groups, including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Miao, Dai, Korean, and Manchu, presented many valuable physical exercise programs to the people of the whole country during five days of performances and competitions. These programs not only demonstrated the heroic and strong character of our people, but also displayed the rich content of our cultural heritage.
    The conference conducted 332 performances of martial arts, folk sports, horse dance steps, light riding, obstacle crossing, beheading, polo, etc., continuously for five days. Friendly competitions were held in five sports: wrestling, fencing (short weapons), archery (target shooting), weightlifting (stone locks, barbells), and boxing. The China Acrobatic Troupe and specially invited representatives from the martial arts community gave extremely brilliant performances to the conference, adding even more color to the event. Many elders in the martial arts community, comparing their experiences during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in this moving scene of great unity among all ethnic groups, said with great excitement: The Communist Party and the People's Government have promoted what the reactionaries wanted all ethnic peoples to forget, and are preparing to study, organize, and promote it. This is truly a great turnaround for ethnic sports!
    On the morning of November 8th, the performances and competitions began. In the four areas of the sports field, various robust and graceful sports activities were carried out simultaneously.
    The specially invited Tianjin Lion Dance Team was performing the lively and healthy folk sport - the Lion Dance. On the central performance stage, specially invited representatives, nationally renowned martial arts figures Li Wenzhen and Zhang Yingjie, successively performed swordsmanship and hard bow skills with beautiful dance postures. On the wrestling stage, Mongolian athletes from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the North China region were engaged in intense and enthusiastic wrestling bouts. On the track in front of the performance stage, valiant and skilled Chinese People's Liberation Army riders were performing horse dance steps. The more than 24,000 spectators were excited by these healthy sports activities, and they burst into enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause. From then on, various colorful ethnic sports programs were displayed one by one.
    The 145 athletes participating in the martial arts performances included not only workers, farmers, professional martial artists, state organ cadres, teachers, students, and businessmen, but also some doctors and housewives. Through regular martial arts training, they all have healthy bodies and have played a certain role in improving or developing production and work. For example, Nie Zengyong, a contestant from the Central South region, was very weak before the age of sixteen. Since he participated in martial arts training, his health has gradually improved. After he transferred to work in a brick and tile factory of a state-owned construction company in 1950, he often overfulfilled his production tasks, and he has been rated as a labor model of the whole factory this year. Another example is Zheng Chengquan, a contestant from the North China region, who is already fifty-eight years old this year. Because he has persisted in martial arts training, he has not been sick for forty years, and he is the strongest worker in the agricultural production mutual aid team. Today, they are active on the performance stage, and their flexible, agile, and graceful movements concretely illustrate to people that only a strong body can undertake more arduous work.
    Among the numerous boxing and equipment performances, the most popular among the audience were "Mian Quan" and "Natural Sword" performed by Lan Suzhen, a female contestant from the Southwest region. The gentle and beautiful "Mian Quan" combines many advantages of gymnastics and dance. Every movement of hers is very harmonious, light, strong and graceful; whether swinging her arms, turning her body, jumping or leaping into the air, she looks extremely natural and vigorous. This is a development of Chinese martial arts and a gain of this conference.
    Simultaneous with the martial arts performances were wrestling and boxing. It was the first time that Mongolian contestants from the Inner Mongolian grasslands participated in a national sports conference in their ethnic wrestling style. After they happily sang "Hurry up! Pick out your wrestlers and let us compete!" the intense wrestling matches began. Two evenly matched opponents - Erehen Batu and Yidamahu from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region - joyfully stepped onto the wrestling stage. As the command flag waved, the two sides immediately intertwined like tigers. Wrestling requires not only finding the opponent's weakness and using skill and strength to throw him down, but also trying to maintain one's own center of gravity and not be thrown down by the opponent in a quick attack. The entire audience cheered for these brave, intelligent, and composed wrestling experts.
    The nationally popular ethnic wrestling is a competition item loved by the audience. The thirty-six excellent contestants from all regions of the country, many of whom are already nationally famous figures. Such as Shen Shaoan, a lightweight contestant from the Central South region, and Zhang Kuiyuan, a heavyweight contestant from the North China region, not only demonstrated their extraordinary physical strength and superb skills in the group cycle competition and the final, but also demonstrated the intelligence and strength of the Chinese people. What is even more valuable is that the contestants have without exception promoted the spirit of unity, friendship, and the new moral style of humbly learning from others' strengths. After a fierce competition, the two sides embraced each other tightly. The sports field was filled with the atmosphere of unity and friendship of the national family. An experienced wrestler said: "In the past, colleagues who practiced this thing were enemies, and if they were thrown down by others, they always thought of revenge; today they are peaceful and harmonious, and this change alone is remarkable."
    The same spirit also appeared in the boxing ring. Boxing is not very popular in our country, but whether they are flyweight, lightweight, light welterweight, middleweight or light heavyweight contestants, they all showed that they have a certain level of skill in this sport in fierce duels.
    On the high weightlifting record board, the numbers "70 kg", "80 kg", "85 kg", "97.5 kg" and other numbers are constantly rising. On the opening day of the conference, Yin Guohua, a flyweight contestant from the People's Liberation Army, broke the national record of 238 kilograms after liberation with a score of 272.5 kilograms. After three days of intense competition, eight weightlifters in the flyweight, lightweight, and middleweight categories broke the national record. Five contestants from the People's Liberation Army won four championships and one runner-up in the seven-level weightlifting competition, and the audience burst into enthusiastic applause for their outstanding achievements.
    In the intervals between performances and competitions, there were graceful folk sports. Four Korean female contestants from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the Northeast performed the "seesaw" loved by the Korean people to everyone. The contestants who were catapulted into the air by the jumping board used various movements to express their lively and brave character. The colorful ethnic costumes and the beautiful and rhythmic movements gave people a very happy feeling. The "rope walking" performance by Sitingke, a Uyghur contestant from the Northwest region, is a sport that requires advanced balance movements and a will not to fear difficulties to perform. Sitingke walked peacefully on a rope about 20 meters high easily and happily, and performed stunts such as "golden rooster stands on one leg" and "handstand". His profound skills won unanimous praise from the audience. The elephant foot drum dance of the Dai athletes and the gourd Sheng dance of the Miao athletes in the Southwest region, which are rich in dance art, are sports dances accompanied by musical instruments. The athletes perform various skillful movements similar to martial arts and mat exercises softly and vigorously to the rhythm of the instruments.
    The conference held wonderful equestrian performances every day. Riders of the People's Liberation Army and young Mongolian herdsmen living in the Inner Mongolian grasslands performed various equestrian skills in a heroic, fast, and skilled manner. The young knights skillfully maneuvered their docile steeds, sometimes trotting, marching, stepping sideways, rotating independently on one leg, and sometimes galloping like flying, crossing various obstacles; the knights sometimes held the saddle tightly and made head-handstand postures, and sometimes two, three, or even more people rode together and made various difficult movements. These brave equestrian performances aroused enthusiastic cheers from the audience.
    Riding and beheading is an important combat method in cavalry operations. Six pairs of People's Liberation Army knights and a pair of Inner Mongolian riders swung their swords and beheaded their targets in a storm-like chase. For a time, the sound of horses' hooves, the sound of beheading, and the cheers and applause of the audience resounded together. The women's 100-meter and 200-meter light riding performances and the polo competition on the last day of the conference were all warmly welcomed by the audience.
    The conference was successfully concluded. The various programs performed and competed in during the five days were like a flower garden in full bloom, but as Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the State Council pointed out in his speech at the opening ceremony: In the past feudal society, just like other cultural heritages, they inevitably carried feudal colors more or less, and some ethnic sports programs also inevitably stained conservative, backward, mysterious, and illusory colors more or less, just like a layer of dirt covering a bright pearl. Therefore, after this great review of ethnic sports, exploring, studying, and organizing these programs in the future to make them more scientifically valuable and serve to enhance people's health, economic construction, and national defense construction will definitely play a huge role.

    记全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会
    程执
    丰富多采的“全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会”，已于十一月十二日在天津胜利闭幕。代表汉、蒙、回、维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔、苗、傣、朝鲜、满等十个民族的三百九十七名运动员，在五天的表演和竞赛中，向全国人民提供了许多有价值的锻炼身体的运动项目。这些项目，不仅表现了我国人民英勇刚强的品质，同时，也显示了我国文化遗产中的丰富内容。
    大会五天连续进行了三百三十二项武术、民间体育和马舞步、轻乘、超越障碍、斩劈、马球等表演，并在摔跤、击剑（短兵）、步射（弓箭射准）、举重（石锁、杠铃）和拳击等五个项目中举行了友谊比赛。中国杂技团与特邀武术界代表向大会作了极精彩的演出，使大会更加生色。许多武术界的长者，在这个各民族大团结的动人的情景里，比照了自己在国民党反动派统治时期的遭遇，他们都十分兴奋地说：共产党和人民政府，把反动派要各族人民忘掉的东西又提倡起来了，而且准备加以研究、整理和推广。这真是民族形式体育运动的大翻身！
    十一月八日上午，表演和竞赛开始了。运动场上的四个区间，同时进行着健壮、优美的各种体育活动。
    特邀的天津市狮子队在表演活泼、健康的民间体育——狮子舞。正中表演台上，特邀代表、全国知名的武术界人士李文贞和张英杰相继表演了具有美妙舞姿的剑术和硬弓。在摔跤台上，内蒙古自治区和华北区蒙族运动员展开着紧张、热烈的搏斗。表演台前的跑道上，英勇善战的中国人民解放军骑手，在表演着马舞步。两万四千多观众，被这些健美的体育活动激动了，他们迸发出热情的欢呼和如雷似的掌声。从此以后，五光十色的各种民族形式体育运动项目，就一一地被展示出来。
    参加武术表演的一百四十五名运动员，不仅包括工人、农民、专业武术界人士、国家机关干部、教员、学生、商人，还有部分医生和家庭妇女。他们通过经常的武术锻炼，都有了健康的体魄，在提高或改进生产、工作等方面，起了一定的作用。如中南区选手聂增永，十六岁前身体很弱，自从他参加了武术锻炼，健康情况逐渐改善。一九五○年转入国营建筑公司某砖瓦厂工作后，经常超额完成生产任务，他今年已被评为全厂劳动模范。又如华北区选手郑成权，今年已经五十八岁了。由于他坚持了武术锻炼，四十年来没有闹病，在农业生产互助组中，他是劳动最强的一个。他们今天活跃在表演台上，灵活、矫健、优美的动作，具体地向人们说明了：只有强壮的身体，才能承担更繁重的工作。
    在名目繁多的拳术和器械表演中，最受观众欢迎的，是西南区女选手蓝素贞的“绵拳”和“自然剑”。柔美的“绵拳”，兼有体操和舞蹈的许多优点。她的每一个动作都十分和谐、轻盈、强健而又优美；无论挥臂、转体、跳跃腾空，都显得极其自然和刚健。这是我国武术的一个发展，也是这次大会的一个收获。
    和武术表演同时进行的，是摔跤和拳击。来自内蒙草原的蒙族选手以本民族的摔跤形式参加全国性的运动大会这还是第一次，他们在愉快地唱过“快一点儿吧！把你们摔跤手选出来，让我们进行比赛吧！”以后，紧张的搏斗就开始了。两个势均力敌的对手——内蒙古自治区的鄂力很巴图和依达玛欢跃着走上摔跤台来。指挥旗一挥动，双方像猛虎似地立即扭结在一起。摔跤，不单需要找寻对方的弱点，用技巧和力量摔倒他；同时还要尽量保持自己的重心，不让对手在一个迅速的攻击中被摔倒。全场观众，为这对勇敢、机智、沉着的摔跤能手助威。
    全国流行的民族形式摔跤，是受观众爱好的一个竞赛项目。来自全国各地区的三十六名优秀选手，有许多已是名闻全国的人物。如中南区轻量级选手沈少三和华北区重量级选手张魁元等人，在分组循环竞赛以及最后的决赛中，不仅表现了他们的过人的体力和高超的技巧，同时，还表现出我国人民的机智和刚强的性格。更可贵的，是选手们都毫不例外地发扬了团结、友爱的精神和虚心学习他人长处的新道德作风。一场猛烈的比赛完结以后，双方选手紧紧地拥抱在一起。运动场上，洋溢着民族大家庭的团结、友爱的气氛。一个经验丰富的摔跤运动员说：“过去练这玩艺儿的同行是冤家，被别人摔倒了总想法子报复；今天却是和和气气的，单是这个转变就很了不起。”
    同样的精神也出现在拳击台上。拳击运动在我国还不很普及，但无论是次轻级、轻量级、轻中量级、中量级或次重级的选手，在凶猛的角斗中，都显示了他们对这项运动已有了一定的造诣。
    高高的举重记录牌上，“七十公斤”、“八十公斤”、“八十五公斤”、“九十七点五公斤”等数字在不断地上升着。大会开幕那天，解放军次轻级选手殷国华以二百七十二点五公斤的成绩打破解放后全国二百三十八公斤的最高纪录。经过三天的紧张争夺，最轻级、轻量级和中量级举重有八名选手，都打破了全国最高纪录。解放军五个选手在七级举重比赛中，夺取了四个冠军和一个亚军，全场观众为他们卓越的成绩爆发出热烈的掌声。
    在表演和竞赛的间隙中进行的，是绰约多姿的民间体育运动。从东北延边朝鲜族自治区来的四名朝鲜族女选手，向大家表演了朝鲜民族喜爱的“跳板”。借跳板弹射力量抛在空中的选手们，用各种动作表现他们活泼、勇敢的性格。五色的民族服装，美妙而又富韵律的动作，给人以十分快活的感觉。西北区选手、维吾尔族司梯克的“踩绳”表演，是需要高级的平衡动作和不畏困难的意志来表演的运动项目。司梯克却轻松、愉快地在高约二十公尺的绳上安详地走着，并表演了“金鸡独立”、“拿大顶”等绝技。他的精深的技巧博得观众的一致好评。富有舞蹈艺术的西南区傣族运动员的象脚鼓舞和苗族运动员的葫芦笙舞，是用乐器伴奏的体育舞蹈。运动员随着乐器的旋律，柔软而又刚劲地表演着类似武术和垫上运动的各种机巧动作。
    大会每天都举行精彩的马术表演。解放军骑手和生活在内蒙草原的蒙族青年牧民，雄健、快速而又很熟练地表演了各种马术。年轻的骑士们，裕如地驾御着驯服的骏马，时而作短跑步，正步、斜横步，单腿独立旋转，时而奔驰如飞，超越各种障碍；骑士们时而紧抓马鞍作头手倒立的姿态，时而两人、三人甚至多人同乘，并作出各种繁难的动作。这些勇敢的骑术表演，激起了观众热烈的欢呼。
    乘马斩劈，是骑兵作战中重要的战斗方式。六对人民解放军骑士和一对内蒙古骑手，在急风暴雨般的奔逐中挥刀斩劈着目标，一时得得的马蹄声、斩劈的嚓嚓声和观众的欢呼与鼓掌声响成一片。女子百公尺、二百公尺轻骑表演和大会最后一天的马球表演比赛，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    大会胜利闭幕了。五天来大会表演和比赛的各种项目，有如百花盛开的花圃，但也正如政务院郭沫若副总理在开幕式的讲话中指出的：在过去的封建社会里面就和其它的文化遗产都不免或多或少地带上了封建色彩一样，民族形式体育的某些项目，也不免或多或少地染上了保守、落后、神秘、玄虚的色彩，这正像光辉灿烂的珍珠上蒙上了一层污泥。因此，经过这次民族形式体育运动的大检阅，对今后发掘、研究和整理这些项目，使它更具科学价值，为增进人民健康，为经济建设和国防建设服务，一定会起巨大的作用。
