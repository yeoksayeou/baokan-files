    The Symbol of Victory
    -- A Record of the Exhibition Hall of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Qingxiang

    The Exhibition Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, sponsored by the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is a symbol of the glorious victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in its just struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    The entrance to the exhibition hall is a tall red gate, with colorful flags fluttering on both sides. The exhibition rooms are two recently built halls facing each other east and west. Many exhibits are also displayed on the square between the two halls.

    In the west exhibition room, various pictures, models, and objects related to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's combat operations over the past three years since going abroad are displayed, as well as various charts and objects showing the infinite love and strong support of the people of the motherland and the Korean people for the Volunteer Army.

    Upon entering the room, the first thing you see are two huge photographs. They record the crimes of the American aggressors and the historical facts of the Chinese people's opposition to aggression and defense of peace. One of them depicts the scene in October 1950 when the American aggressor army brought the flames of war to the border of our motherland – the south bank of the Yalu River; the other depicts the scene of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people forming the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and bravely heading to the Korean battlefield under the just banner of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting the Home and Defending the Country." On a platform on one side of the room, are displayed the Certificates of Merit issued by the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to those who performed meritorious service in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Good News of Merit sent to the families of those who performed meritorious service, and various medals and awards awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. In several exquisite glass cabinets, are placed various medals and certificates awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the immortal heroic models of the Volunteer Army: Huang Jiguang, Yang Gensi, Luo Shengjiao, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, Yang Liandi, Wu Xianhua, Yang Chunzeng, and other martyrs, as well as many "Hero Biographies" of combat heroes. The inscription personally written by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people: "The internationalist spirit of Martyr Luo Shengjiao will forever coexist with the Korean people!" is placed in an exquisite glass cabinet. On the wall hanging the stretcher used by the internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed himself to save wounded Volunteer Army soldiers, there are statistical charts of the Korean people carrying stretchers, washing clothes, and giving慰问 performances to the Volunteer Army, as well as statistics on the motherland people's donation campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and many comfort letters, comfort bags, and silk banners from the motherland. In addition, there are many photographs of the Korean people慰问ing the Volunteer Army and the activities of the first and second delegations from the motherland to Korea to慰问.

    In this exhibition room, there are also battle diagrams and battle statistics of the five large-scale offensive operations from October 25, 1950, to May 1951, in which the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army drove the American aggressor army from the Yalu River to south of the 38th parallel. These five battles stabilized the Korean war situation and laid the foundation for future victories.

    Here are also statistical tables of the underground Great Wall – tunnel fortifications – built by the Volunteer Army with their own wisdom and great labor, cross-sectional models of the tunnels, and various tools used by the soldiers when constructing the tunnels. Models of the famous heroic positions such as Shangganling and Ma Liangshan, and the model of Shangpu Fangdong Mountain (called "Old Baldy" by the enemy), a position that the enemy and us had repeatedly and fiercely fought over, as well as the battlefield model and battle statistics of the large-scale counterattack operation on the Jincheng front this summer, are also displayed here. From these exhibits, people can clearly see the combat situation between the enemy and us on the battlefield at that time and the situation of our victory and the enemy's defeat.

    In a semi-circular frame, there is a display of the machine gun used by the first-class hero, immortal Communist Party member, platoon leader Sun Zhanyuan, during the Shangganling campaign, as well as the submachine gun used by the first-class hero, great fighter Qiu Shaoyun. The relics of the special-class hero Huang Jiguang and the certificate awarding him the title of model member of the Communist Youth League are also displayed here.

    On another green table are arranged many meritorious weapons. Here is the anti-aircraft machine gun used by Wang Zhiguo, an anti-aircraft machine gunner who shot down ten enemy planes and damaged nine enemy planes in the battle on the Yuyin Mountain position, and won the first-class merit; the iron-handled submachine gun used by Hu Yanshou, a first-class meritorious hero who annihilated 121 enemies on the Wendeng Highway in the battle to smash the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," and the submachine gun used by the second-class hero Yi Caixue...

    In this exhibition room, there are also valuable observation equipment equipped by the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army artillery units, photos of outstanding heroes of the artillery units such as Tan Chaozhi, Liu Si, and Zhu Jinchi, and a brief sand table model of the artillery units closely cooperating with the infantry in the counterattack battle south of Jincheng this summer.

    Here are also statistics on the glorious achievements of the Volunteer Army Air Force, and photos of Air Force heroes Wang Hai, Lu Min, Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and martyr Sun Shenglu, and photos of the Air Force hitting enemy planes.

    A large number of captured goods are also displayed in this exhibition room. Among them are many military flags and "award flags" of the American aggressor army and the Li pseudo army, as well as the hat badges, armbands, and collar badges of various divisions of the American aggressor army and the Li Seung-man puppet army, as well as the British Commonwealth First Division, the Canadian 25th Brigade, the Turkish Brigade, the Dutch Battalion, the Belgian-Luxembourg Battalion, the Greek Battalion, and other auxiliary troops. There are "nylon bulletproof vests" penetrated by many bullets, and the pistol used by U.S. Air Force Major Davis, who was killed by our army, and the "survival flags" written in nine languages, including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, German, Burmese, Hindi, French, and English, by the U.S. military.

    Among the captured goods are also military maps carried by the American aggressor army. The maps depict the Songhua River basin in China, the Manchurian lake area, the Liaodong Bay area, the Yellow River basin, the Shandong Peninsula, the provinces of North China, and the Bohai Bay, as well as the Khanka Lake area and the Tukuringra Mountains in the Soviet Union. From these maps, people can see how crazy and shameful the American imperialists' aggressive ambitions are!

    In the east exhibition room, many models, charts, and photos of the train transportation network, automobile transportation lines, newly built highways, underground repair factories, and the supply work of the counterattack battle south of Jincheng this summer and various bridges built by the engineering corps are displayed. These exhibits fully demonstrate the brilliant victories our army has achieved on the steel transportation line over the past three years.

    The victory of the railway troops' struggle against the enemy is also displayed here with model diagrams and objects. One explanation records: The enemy once relied on "air superiority" to implement the so-called "strangulation warfare" and "key bombing" on a certain railway line, attempting to cut off our railway troops' supply to the front. In two years and nine months, enemy aircraft dispatched 59,013 sorties to bomb our railway line, with the highest month reaching 8,384 sorties, averaging 157 shells per kilometer. Below this explanation is a model of the railway troops repairing bridges. From the model, it can be seen that as soon as a large bridge was bombed by enemy aircraft, a new temporary bridge was already erected on the other side of the river, and the locomotive spewing black smoke drove out of the tunnel and continued to drive towards the front...

    A model of more than ten square meters shows the picture of our army supplying materials to the front line during this summer's counterattack campaign. Countless anti-aircraft guns point to the sky, and the mighty transport ranks of automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and pedestrian transporters move continuously day and night to the battlefield that is rapidly moving south. The achievement table of the automobile unit records the miracle of driving in the war zone: 688 vehicles in the entire army have safely driven more than 40,000 kilometers without major repairs. The car driven by Liu Jingbo has safely driven more than 71,400 kilometers without intermediate repairs since July 1951, creating the highest record for safe driving mileage of Volunteer Army vehicles. On the wall displaying many auto parts manufactured by the automobile unit using waste materials, there is an explanatory sign that reads: According to incomplete statistics, since the Volunteer Army logistics automobile unit entered Korea, it has invented and created 208 types and 271,736 pieces, saving approximately 14.7187261 billion yuan in materials. Here is also a "Supply Picture of Staple and Non-staple Foods of the Volunteer Army." It shows the continuous improvement of the Volunteer Army's material life. Here are also the evidence of the American imperialists' inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea – photos and containers for releasing bacterial poisonous insects. Here are also photos of the troops' anti-bacterial warfare, eliminating poisonous insects and poisonous substances, various epidemic prevention activities, and various charts explaining the victory of the anti-bacterial warfare.

    Here are displayed photos of the life, study, and recreational activities of the Volunteer Army soldiers in the frontline tunnels, and the shell lamps, lighters, and steamers made of aluminum sheets from downed enemy planes, and many daily necessities made by the soldiers using waste products during the difficult days.

    On the outdoor square are lined up new weapons such as tanks, artillery, rocket launchers, and anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army. These weapons have greatly improved the equipment of the Volunteer Army. Among these weapons, one howitzer destroyed and damaged 33 enemy tanks, destroyed 16 vehicles, and killed and wounded 572 enemies in the defensive battle to crush an enemy invasion in August 1952. This artillery squad gloriously won the collective second-class merit. One tank destroyer gun was used by the gunners to destroy six steel-reinforced concrete bunkers of the enemy in a single operation during this summer's counterattack operation, enabling the infantry to occupy the enemy's position without any casualties. One tank destroyed five enemy tanks in combat. One anti-aircraft gun was used by the gunners to damage and shoot down 38 enemy planes (including 14 shot down).

    Next to these mighty weapons are many American-style machine guns, heavy tanks, and artillery of various calibers captured from the enemy, as well as the wreckage of American bombers and jet fighters shot down by our army's anti-aircraft artillery units. These captured goods mark the shameful defeat of the "air superiority" and "firepower superiority" repeatedly touted by the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield.

    These many historically significant souvenirs, charts, models, and captured goods reflect the victorious process of the anti-aggression war of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and are a shining symbol of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army growing stronger and stronger and moving from victory to victory on the Korean front.

    胜利的标志
    ——记中国人民志愿军抗美援朝展览馆
    新华社记者　韩庆祥
    中国人民志愿军领导机关主办的抗美援朝展览馆，是中国人民志愿军抗美援朝正义斗争中所取得的光荣的胜利的标志。
    展览馆的入口处是一座高大的红色大门，大门的两旁飘扬着一面面彩旗。展览室是最近赶建起来的两座东西相对的大厅。在两座大厅之间的广场上，也陈列着许多展览品。
    在西面的展览室里，陈列着中国人民志愿军出国三年来有关作战方面的各种图片、模型和实物，以及显示祖国人民和朝鲜人民对志愿军的无限热爱和强大支援的各种图表和实物。
    走进室内，首先看到的是两幅巨大的照片。它记载着美国侵略者的罪行和中国人民反对侵略、保卫和平的历史事实。其中一幅是一九五零年十月美国侵略军把战火烧到我们祖国的边境——鸭绿江南岸时的情景；一幅是中国人民的优秀儿女组成了中国人民志愿军，在“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的正义旗帜下，奋勇开赴朝鲜战场的情景。在室内一边的平台上，陈列着中国人民志愿军政治部为在抗美援朝战争中立功的人员颁发的立功证明书、寄给立功人员家属的立功喜报和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授予志愿军指挥员、战斗员的各种勋章和奖章。在几个精制的玻璃柜内，放置着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授予志愿军不朽的英雄模范人物黄继光、杨根思、罗盛教、邱少云、孙占元、杨连第、伍先华、杨春增等烈士的各种勋章和奖状，以及许多战斗英雄的“英雄传”。朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的亲笔题字：“罗盛教烈士的国际主义精神与朝鲜人民永远共存！”被安置在一个精制的玻璃柜内。在挂着舍身抢救志愿军伤员的国际主义战士朴在根烈士生前所用的担架的墙壁上，有着朝鲜人民为志愿军抬担架、洗衣服和向志愿军作慰问演出的统计图表和祖国人民抗美援朝捐献运动的统计数字，以及来自祖国的许多慰问信、慰问袋和锦旗。另外还有许多朝鲜人民向志愿军进行慰问和祖国人民第一、二届赴朝慰问团的活动的照片。
    在这个展览室内，还陈列着从一九五零年十月二十五日到一九五一年五月，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边赶到三八线以南的五次大规模攻势作战的战斗经过图解和战绩统计。这五次战役，稳定了朝鲜战局，为以后的胜利，打下了基础。
    这里还有志愿军用自己的智慧和巨大的劳动所筑成的地下长城——坑道工事的统计表、坑道的平面解剖模型和战士们构筑坑道时使用过的各种工具。著名的上甘岭、马良山等英雄阵地和敌我曾经反复激烈争夺的上浦防东山（敌称“老秃山”）等阵地模型，以及今年夏季金城前线大规模反击作战的战场模型和战绩统计，也陈列在这里。从这些陈列品上，人们可以清楚地看出当时战场上敌我双方作战的情况和我胜敌败的情况。
    在一个半圆形的框子上，陈列着在上甘岭战役中出现的一级英雄、不朽的共产党员、排长孙占元烈士生前用过的机关枪，以及一级英雄、伟大的战士邱少云烈士生前用过的冲锋枪。特级英雄黄继光烈士的遗物和追赠他为模范青年团员的奖状也陈列在这里。
    在另一个绿色的桌子上排列着许多功勋武器。这里有在鱼隐山阵地上，先后击落敌机十架，击伤敌机九架，荣立一等功的高射机关枪手王治国使用的高射机关枪；在粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”的战斗中，在文登公路上歼敌一百二十一名的一等功臣胡延寿使用的铁把冲锋枪和二级英雄易才学用过的冲锋枪………。
    在这个展览室里，还陈列着祖国人民为志愿军炮兵部队装备的贵重的观测器材、炮兵部队突出的英雄谭朝志、刘四、朱金池等人的照片和今年夏季金城以南反击战中，炮兵部队密切配合步兵作战的简要沙盘模型。
    这里还有志愿军空军辉煌战绩的统计表，和空军英雄王海、鲁珉、张积慧、赵宝桐及烈士孙生禄等的照片和空军射击命中敌机时的照片。
    在这个展览室里还陈列着大批缴获品。其中有许多美国侵略军和李伪军的军旗和“奖旗”，还有美国侵略军和李承晚伪军的各个师以及帮凶军英联邦第一师，加拿大第二十五旅，土耳其旅，荷兰营，比利时、卢森堡营，希腊营等部队的帽徽、臂章和领章，有被许多子弹穿透的“尼龙避弹衣”，还有被我军击毙的美国空军少校戴维斯使用过的手枪和美军用中文、朝鲜文、日文、俄文、德文、缅甸文、印地文、法文、英文等九种文字写成的“求生旗”。
    缴获品中还有美国侵略军所携带的军用地图。图上绘着中国的松花江流域、满洲里湖泊地带、辽东湾地区、黄河流域、山东半岛、华北各省及渤海湾等分图，以及苏联的兴凯湖地区、土库仁哥山脉等地。人们从这些地图观察到：美帝国主义的侵略野心是多么疯狂，多么可耻！
    在东面展览室里陈列着火车运输网、汽车运输线、新修起来的公路、地下修理工厂以及今年夏季金城以南反击战的供应工作和工兵部队架筑的各种桥梁的许多模型、图表和照片。这些陈列品充分地显示了三年来我军在钢铁运输线上所获得的辉煌胜利。
    铁道部队对敌斗争的胜利，也用模型图表和实物在这里显示出来。有一份说明记载着：敌人曾依恃“空中优势”在某条铁路线上实行所谓“绞杀战”和“重点轰炸”，企图切断我铁道部队对前方的供应。在两年零九个月中，敌机出动了五万九千零一十三架次来轰炸我们的铁道线，最高的月份达八千三百八十四架次，每公里平均落弹一百五十七枚。在这个说明下边是铁道部队抢修桥梁的模型，从模型上看到：一处大桥刚被敌机炸断，在河的另一处，一道新的便桥已经架好，机车喷吐着黑烟从山洞里开了出来，继续向前方开去……。
    有一个十余平方公尺的模型展示了我军在今年夏季反击战役时向前线供应物资的图面。无数门高射炮指向天空，汽车、马车和徒步运输员的浩大的运输行列川流不息、昼夜不停地开赴迅速向南移动的战地。汽车部队的成绩表里记载着战地行车的奇迹：全军不经大修安全行车四万公里以上的车辆已有六百八十八辆。刘静波所驾驶的汽车从一九五一年七月至今未经中修已安全行车七万一千四百多公里，创造了志愿军汽车安全行车里程的最高纪录。在陈列着汽车部队利用废料制造的许多汽车零件的墙上挂着一个说明牌，上面写着：据不完全统计，志愿军后勤汽车部队自入朝以来，发明创造有二百零八种、二十七万一千七百三十六件，节省了约值人民币一百四十七亿一千八百七十二万六千一百元的资财。这里还有一幅“志愿军的主副食的供应图画”。它表明了志愿军物质生活不断改进的情况。这里还有美帝国主义在朝鲜灭绝人性地进行细菌战的罪证——照片和施放细菌毒虫的容器。这里更有部队反细菌战的消灭毒虫、毒物，各种防疫活动的照片以及各种说明反细菌战胜利的图表。
    这里陈列着志愿军战士在前沿坑道中的生活、学习和文娱活动的照片，和战士们在艰苦的日子里，利用废品制成的炮弹灯、打火机，用打落的敌机上的铝片做的蒸笼和许许多多的日用品。
    在室外的广场上排列着祖国人民捐献给志愿军的坦克、大炮、火箭炮、高射炮等新式武器。这些武器使志愿军在装备上得到了很大的改善。在这些武器中，有一门榴弹炮在粉碎敌人一九五二年八月某次进犯的阻击战中，打毁打伤敌人坦克三十三辆，打毁汽车十六辆，毙伤敌人五百七十二人。这个炮班光荣地立了集体二等功。有一门坦克歼击炮，炮手们用它在今年夏季反击作战中，一次击毁敌军六座钢骨水泥碉堡，使步兵无一伤亡就攻占了敌人阵地。有一辆坦克，在作战中打毁过敌人五辆坦克。有一门高射炮，炮手们用它打伤打落了敌机三十八架（其中打落十四架）。
    在这些威武的武器的旁边，排列着许多从敌人手中缴获的美式机关枪、重型坦克和各种口径的火炮，还有被我军高射炮部队打落的美国轰炸机、喷气战斗机的残骸。这些缴获品，标志着美国侵略者所一再吹嘘的“空军优势”和“炮火优势”在朝鲜战场上的可耻败迹。
    这许多具有历史意义的纪念品、图表、模型和缴获品，反映了朝中人民反侵略战争的胜利的进程，也就是中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线愈战愈强从胜利走向胜利的光辉标志。
