    Political Work and Economic Work Closely Cooperate
    Great Achievements in Grain Purchase Work in Dali Village Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province
    In Dali Village Township, Second District, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, political work and economic work were closely coordinated during grain purchase, achieving great results. The Shouzhang County Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party widely publicized the general line for the transition period to the nation, and fully supplied the materials needed by farmers by holding a material exchange fair. During the material exchange fair, farmers in Dali Village Township sold more than 77,000 jin of grain to the state.
    In late October, Dali Village Township held a material exchange fair. Before the material exchange fair, the Shouzhang County Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in addition to organizing relevant departments such as banks and cooperatives to actively transfer materials, organize manpower, and prepare for purchasing, supplying, and recovering loans, actively educated cadres and farmers on the general line and general task of the nation's transition period through various organizations at the township and village levels. Each village, from within the Party to outside the Party, from mutual aid and cooperation organizations to the vast number of farmers, used methods such as summarizing production achievements, accounting, and comparison to publicize to the farmers the principles and benefits of national socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and explained the methods of implementing national socialist industrialization and agricultural socialist transformation. After discussions, the farmers of the whole township realized that with the development of national industry, more new-style agricultural tools and agricultural machinery could be manufactured to help farmers develop agricultural production on a large scale, and cooperate with the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that farmers could move towards the road of common prosperity; they realized that in order to support national construction and promote national socialist industrialization, all farmers should actively expand production, develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and sell surplus grain to the state. Farmer Li Changjiang said: "The plows and pesticides used by our mutual aid group are all manufactured by factories. We support industrial production by selling grain, so that factories can make more and better agricultural tools for us." Li Changjian's father said: "Earlier, when my son wanted to sell grain to the state, I still said he was a spendthrift. Now I know that only when the country is well built can we live a better life. I have decided to sell nine shi of grain to the state. When the country is industrialized, we will be able to greatly improve production and live a better life." Everyone was in high spirits and actively prepared to sell grain to the cooperative and buy back walking plows, chemical fertilizers, etc. at the material exchange fair to expand production. The Li Changjiang mutual aid group planned to sell 1,870 jin of grain, buy a walking plow, 180 jin of chemical fertilizer, and other means of production and daily necessities.
    After the opening of the material exchange fair, farmers from various villages actively brought grain to the fair to sell. In a very short period of time, the entire township sold more than 77,000 jin of grain and bought back more than 23 million yuan worth of means of production and means of livelihood. In addition, farmers also automatically returned more than 24 million yuan in agricultural loans.

    政治工作和经济工作密切配合
    山东省寿张县大李庄乡购粮工作成绩大
    山东省寿张县第二区大李庄乡，在购粮中政治工作和经济工作密切配合进行，取得很大成绩，中共寿张县第二区委会，在大李庄乡广泛宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线，并通过举行物资交流会，充分供应农民需要的物资。在物资交流会举行期间，大李庄乡农民卖给国家的粮食达七万七千余斤。
    十月下旬，大李庄乡举行了物资交流会。在举行物资交流会之前，中共寿张县第二区委会除组织银行、合作社等有关部门积极调运物资，组织人力，进行收购、供应及收回贷款的准备工作外，通过乡、村各种组织积极向干部、农民进行了国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的教育。各村都从党内到党外，由互助合作组织到广大农民，用总结生产成绩、算账、对比等方法，向农民宣传了国家社会主义工业化和农业合作化的道理和好处，说明了实行国家社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的方法。全乡农民经过座谈讨论，认识到国家工业发展了，才能多制造新式农具和农业机器来帮助农民大规模地发展农业生产，配合互助合作组织的发展，使农民走向大家富裕的道路；认识到要支援国家建设，促进国家社会主义工业化，全体农民就应该积极扩大生产，发展互助合作组织，并把余粮卖给国家。农民李长江说：“我们互助组用的步犁、农药，都是工厂制造的。我们打了粮食支持工业生产，才能让工厂给我们造出更多更好的农具。”李长建的父亲说：“早先我儿子要把粮食卖给国家，我还说他是败家子哩。现在我才知道，国家建设好了，我们的日子才能过得更好。我决定把九石粮食卖给国家。国家工业化了的时候，咱们就能大大提高生产，过更美好的日子。”大家情绪很高，都积极准备到物资交流会上把粮食卖给合作社，买回步犁、化学肥料等，扩大生产。李长江互助组计划卖粮食一千八百七十斤，买一部步犁，一百八十斤化学肥料，和其他生产资料、生活用品。
    物资交流会开幕后，各村农民都积极带粮食到会上出售。很短的时间内，全乡就卖了七万七千余斤粮食，买回值二千三百余万元的生产资料和生活资料。另外，农民还自动归还了二千四百余万元的农业贷款。
