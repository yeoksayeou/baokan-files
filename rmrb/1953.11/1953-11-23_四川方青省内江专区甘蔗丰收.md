Sichuan Neijiang Special District's Tuojiang River basin sugarcane has had a bumper harvest this year. Judging from the early-maturing sugarcane that has already begun to be harvested, the yield per unit area is generally 10% higher than last year. The 1,400 mu of sugarcane planted in the sixth village of Leqiao Township, Third District, Neijiang County, yielded more than 1 million kilograms more than last year. It is estimated that the total sugarcane production in the Tuojiang River basin this year will increase by 40% compared to last year. The main reason for the sugarcane harvest is that this year the government has universally promoted improved sugarcane seeds in the producing areas. The quality and yield of improved sugarcane are higher than that of reed sugarcane. Each mu of reed sugarcane produces 3,000 jin, while each mu of improved sugarcane can harvest 4,500 jin to 5,000 jin, and the sugar content of improved sugarcane is 40% higher than that of reed sugarcane. This year, according to statistics from Neijiang and five other counties, the planting area of improved sugarcane has expanded by 110% compared to last year. In addition, the government issued loans in March to help poor sugarcane farmers solve the difficulties of fertilizers and seeds in a timely manner. At the same time, sugarcane farmers generally increased the amount of human manure and compost compared to last year.

In order to solve the difficulties in sugarcane pressing in a timely manner, in addition to the state-owned sugar factories starting to purchase new sugarcane in early September and stepping up crushing, cooperatives have also actively expanded the operating institutions of sugar mills. They have established 1,128 sugar mills in the entire special district (61 more than last year). Over the past month, the cooperatives in Neijiang, Zizhong, and Ziyang have signed contracts with the Zizhong, Sanyuan, and Longshan local state-owned sugar factories to process more than 520 million jin of sugarcane for the state-owned sugar factories, supplying the raw sugar liquor and syrup needed by the state-owned sugar factories.

### 四川方青省内江专区甘蔗丰收

    四川方青省内江专区甘蔗丰收
    四川内江专区沱江流域的甘蔗，今年获得丰收。从已开始收割的早熟甘蔗来看，单位面积产量一般比去年提高百分之十。内江县三区乐礄乡六村种的一千四百亩甘蔗，比去年多收了一百多万公斤。估计沱江流域今年的甘蔗总产量，将比去年增加百分之四十。甘蔗丰收的主要原因是：今年政府在产区普遍推广了良蔗种籽，良蔗的质量与产量都比芦蔗高，每亩芦蔗产三千斤，良蔗每亩则可收四千五百斤到五千斤，而含糖成分良蔗又比芦蔗高百分之四十。今年良蔗的种植面积，据内江等五县统计，比去年扩大百分之一百一十。此外还因政府在三月间发放了贷款，及时帮助贫苦蔗农解决肥料、种籽困难，同时一般蔗农都比去年增加了人粪和堆肥。
    为及时解决压蔗中的困难，除国营糖厂在九月上旬即开始收购新甘蔗，加紧压榨外，合作社并积极扩大糖坊的经营机构，在全专区设立了一千一百二十八个糖坊（比去年增加六十一个），一个多月来，内江、资中、资阳三地合作社，已与资中、三元、龙山三个地方国营糖厂订立了合同，替国营糖厂加工甘蔗五亿二千多万斤，供应国营糖厂所需的原料糖清与糖浆。（西南记者站）
