In Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, there are 984 agricultural production cooperatives. Except for 20 cooperatives whose management is not good and whose yields of some crops are lower than those of local mutual aid teams, the yields and income of the remaining 881 cooperatives are higher than last year and also higher than those of local mutual aid teams. Among them, one-third of the cooperatives increased production by 20% compared with last year, and nearly two-thirds of the cooperatives increased production by 30% to 40% compared with last year. A few cooperatives increased production by 50% to 60% compared with last year. There were also 83 cooperatives that, although suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and hail, did not exceed last year's output, but they were still higher than the output of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The cooperative members have all earned more grain than ordinary farmers. The 984 cooperatives, with a total population of 106,148, have an average of 748.5 jin of grain per person, which is 191 jin more than the average of 557.5 jin per person in the entire special district.

Why are the yields and incomes of 881 cooperatives higher than last year? Why can the output of 83 cooperatives be higher than that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers under the same disaster conditions as local farmers?

Let's look at the facts of a few cooperatives.

The land of Cao Lanmu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chibaopu Village, Qin County, has two types: one type is shady and humid, which they call "Xiapingdi" (lower land). It is not suitable for planting millet, but corn yields are high; the other type is dry land and sunny, which they call "Shangpingdi" (upper land), which is suitable for planting millet, but corn yields are not high. However, before the establishment of the cooperative, each farmer had to plant various grains on his own land to ensure that he would not always eat the same food. Cao Huiwen's family had all "Xiapingdi" land. Although it was not suitable for planting millet, they still had to plant half millet and half corn every year; Cao Lanmu's family had more "Shangpingdi" land. Although it was suitable for planting millet, they also had to plant half corn. Cao Huiwen's family and Cao Lanmu's family were like this, and so were other families in the village. No one knows how much grain the whole village lost every year. In the past, everyone knew that this was a losing proposition, but no one could think of a solution, and even experienced old farmers had no way to solve this problem. After the organization of mutual aid teams, although labor was much better than working alone, it still could not solve this problem. It was not until the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives that this problem was solved. This spring, the Cao Lanmu cooperative planted all the "Xiapingdi" land of the entire cooperative with golden corn, and planted all the "Shangpingdi" land with millet and other crops. In this way, in the fall, the 28 mu of corn fields in "Xiapingdi" alone harvested 13,020 jin of corn, with an average yield of 465 jin of grain per mu. Those individual households who had to plant millet in "Xiapingdi" only harvested a maximum of 120 jin of millet per mu. Because the agricultural production cooperative can plant suitable crops according to the soil, each mu yields 345 jin more than planting millet, and the entire cooperative harvests 9,660 jin more grain than last year in corn alone. Take the Yuanzhuang Lianquanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingchuan County as another example. The biggest difficulty for the farmers in Yuanzhuang is the lack of drinking water. They can barely cope during the slack season, but during the busy season, they still have to run more than ten miles to fetch water every day, which greatly affects production. In the past, more than 1,000 workdays were lost each year due to fetching water. At that time, people often advocated building a water pool to solve this difficulty, but when it came time to plant the land, each family was busy planting their own land, and who had the time to build a pool. Farmers could not solve this difficulty when working alone, and mutual aid teams could not solve this difficulty either. It was not until the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, with more people and greater strength, that this difficulty was solved.

Another superior condition of the agricultural production cooperative is that it can uniformly use labor. This year, when weeding seedlings, the Lianquanbao cooperative planned to completely extract all the full labor force of the cooperative to build water pools, and let women and semi-labor force weed the seedlings. In this way, not only were the millet seedlings weeded on time, but the water pool was also built. After weeding the seedlings, they planned to extract some people to engage in sideline production, and the rest of the people farmed in the cooperative. The people who farmed at home not only weeded the crops three times and applied top dressing on time; they also reclaimed six mu of river beach land and improved 47 mu of land. At harvest time, the average yield per mu increased by 86 jin of grain compared with last year; 62 jin of grain more per mu than the best mutual aid team in the township; and 134 jin of grain more per mu than Feng Yulin, the best individual farmer in the township. Sideline production also earned a net profit of 4 million yuan. This year, in most cooperatives in the entire special district, because of the unified use of labor, division of labor according to people's specialties, and the implementation of the contracting of work and output, labor efficiency generally increased by 25%. This prepares the conditions for deep plowing and meticulous farming, water conservancy construction, and the adoption of new agricultural technologies. This year, the land of more than 900 cooperatives in the entire special district has generally achieved three plows, three harrows, and three weedings, with top dressing applied in stages, and the amount of fertilizer applied has also increased by one-third compared with last year, some even doubling; the cooperatives have generally implemented new technologies such as close planting, which has further increased yields. Gao Yukuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaguihua Village, Licheng County, applied 50 jin of base fertilizer and 40 jin of bean cake per mu as top dressing, and achieved appropriate close planting when weeding seedlings. In the fall, each mu yielded 840 jin of corn. Wang Jiang, an individual farmer who always wanted to compete with the cooperative, only harvested 478 jin per mu. As soon as the grain was harvested, Wang Jiang regretted it. He said:
"Without participating in the agricultural cooperative, no matter how hard you work, you can't compare with the high output of the agricultural cooperative."

Agricultural production cooperatives can not only produce more grain and increase income under normal circumstances, but also have the strength to fight against disasters and strive for increased production when encountering various disasters. This year, Xisai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County suffered four disasters: When the millet seedlings just emerged, they suffered a flood, and they immediately replanted them; when the replanted millet had just grown to two or three leaves, they suffered a hail disaster again, and the seedlings were destroyed by the hail. They quickly replanted a second time; when the millet was heading, a wind disaster came again, blowing down the millet seedlings that were about to head. They mobilized the cooperative members to prop up the millet seedlings one by one, so that the millet seedlings did not miss the heading; near autumn, there was a drought again. Because they usually weeded diligently and there were few weeds, the millet seedlings were not greatly affected. As a result of fighting the disaster four times, the yield per mu was 26% higher than the best mutual aid team in the village. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative members all said: "If it weren't for the agricultural production cooperative this year, we would have been exhausted and unable to fight these four disasters." Compared with the mutual aid teams and individual farmers who suffered the same disaster, the agricultural production cooperative achieved two different harvests. For example, Guo Yu'en's cooperative's 102 mu of corn fields yielded 405 jin more per mu than the mutual aid team under the same drought conditions. The main reason is that the agricultural production cooperative can uniformly allocate labor and concentrate all its efforts to fight drought.

The agricultural production cooperative produced more grain and increased income, which not only consolidated the cooperative itself, but also affected the surrounding farmers. Before the autumn harvest this year, farmers who had not personally experienced the benefits of the cooperative were adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards joining the cooperative and did not fully believe that the cooperative could harvest more grain. When it came to comparing yields, they found that no one had a higher yield than the cooperative, so those who had adopted a wait-and-see attitude were determined to join the cooperative, and those who did not believe that the cooperative could harvest more grain were also convinced. They said that agricultural production cooperatives have four major benefits (namely, great labor, great manure, great disaster resistance, and great income from agricultural and sideline industries) and three major unifications (namely, unified planning, unified use of labor, and unified investment in land), so they can generally implement new agricultural technologies and have the strength to fight against disasters. Therefore, the output of agricultural production cooperatives is higher year by year. According to materials learned from five counties, including Changzhi, Changzi, and Pingshun: after the autumn harvest, 134 mutual aid teams and 2,609 farmers have requested to establish cooperatives and join cooperatives.

    为什么农业生产合作社的产量高
    本报记者　鲁生
    山西省长治专区有九百八十四个农业生产合作社，除二十个社由于经营管理不好，有些农作物不如当地互助组的产量高外，其余八百八十一个社的产量和收入都比去年高，也比当地的互助组高。其中三分之一的社比去年增产百分之二十，将近三分之二的社，比去年增产百分之三十到四十，有少数社比去年增产百分之五十到六十。还有八十三个社虽然遭受了水、旱、风、雹等灾害，没有超过去年的产量，但也比当地互助组和个体农民的产量高。入社户都比一般农民收入了较多的粮食，九百八十四个社，共有十万六千一百四十八口人，平均每人得粮食七百四十八斤五两，比全专区每人平均量五百五十七斤五两多一百九十一斤。
    为什么八百八十一个社的产量和收入都比去年高？为什么八十三个社在和当地农民同样遭灾的情况下，产量还能比互助组和个体农民高？
    让我们看看几个合作社的事实吧。
    沁县池堡村曹蓝木农业生产合作社的土地有两类：一类地背阴潮湿，他们称为“下坪地”。不适宜种谷，但种玉米就产量高；一类地是白干土地又向阳，他们称为“上坪地”，适宜种谷，种玉米收成不大。可是没有成立合作社前，每户农民必须在自己土地上种下各种粮食，才能保证不致老吃一样饭。农民曹会文家全是“下坪地”，虽然不适宜种谷子，每年也得种上一半谷子一半玉米；曹蓝木的“上坪地”多，虽然种谷适宜，也得种上一半玉米。曹会文家曹蓝木家这样，村里别人家也是这样。全村每年不知道要少产多少粮食。在过去，人人都知道这是件吃亏的事情，可是谁也想不出解决办法，就是很会种地的老农也没办法解决这个问题。组织起互助组以后，虽然劳动起来比单干时好多了，但还是不能解决这个问题。直到成立农业生产合作社后才把这个问题解决了。今春曹蓝木社把全社的“下坪地”全种上金黄后玉米，把“上坪地”全种上谷子及其他农作物，这样到秋天，单“下坪地”的二十八亩玉米田，就收获一万三千零二十斤玉米，每亩平均收四百六十五斤粮，那些不得不在“下坪地”种谷子的单干户，每亩最高才收一百二十斤谷。农业生产合作社由于能根据土壤种植适宜的农作物，就使每亩地比种谷多收三百四十五斤，全社单玉米一项就比去年多收九千六百六十斤粮食。再拿陵川县原庄连全保农业生产合作社来说，原庄农民最大的困难是缺水吃。农闲时还可以勉强对付，农忙时，也像平常那样每天跑十多里外去担水，就很影响生产了。过去因担水误的工，每年都在一千个以上。当时也常有人提倡修水池解决这个困难，可是一到种地时，各家都忙着去种各家的地，谁还有工夫来修池。农民在单干时没法解决这个困难，组织起互助组也没有能够解决这个困难，直到成立农业合作社后，人多力量大，才把这个困难解决了。
    农业生产合作社的另一个优越条件是能统一使用劳力。连全保社今年锄苗时，有计划地把社的全劳力完全抽出来打水池，让妇女和半劳力锄苗。这样不仅谷苗按时锄齐了，水池也打成了。锄苗后，他们又有计划地抽出一些人来搞副业生产，其余的人在社种地。在家种地的人除把庄稼全锄三遍和按时上追肥外；还修了六亩河滩地，改良四十七亩地的土壤。秋收时，平均每亩比去年增产八十六斤粮；比全乡最好的互助组每亩多收六十二斤粮；比全乡劳动最好的单干农民冯玉林每亩多收一百三十四斤粮。副业生产也净赚纯利四百万元。今年全专区大部分社因为统一使用劳动力，按人的特长分工，和实行包工包产制，劳动效率一般都提高百分之二十五。这就给深耕细作，兴修水利，采用新的农业技术准备了条件。今年全专区九百多个社的土地都普遍作到了耕三耙三锄三，分期上追肥，而且上肥的数量也比去年增加三分之一，有的甚至增加一倍；各社都普遍实行了密植等新的技术，更使产量普遍提高。黎城县下桂花村高玉宽农业生产合作社的地，每亩上五十斤底肥和四十斤豆饼做追肥，锄苗时作到适当密植，到秋天，每亩产八百四十斤玉米。处处想跟合作社比长短的单干农民王江，每亩只收了四百七十八斤。粮食一收下来，王江就后悔了，他说：
  “不参加农业合作社，无论怎么出力，也比不上农业合作社的产量高。”
    农业生产合作社不仅在一般的情况下能多产粮食增加收入，在遇到各种灾害袭击时，也有力量和灾害作斗争，争取增产。平顺县西赛农业生产合作社今年遭了四次灾：谷苗刚出土，遭了水灾，他们马上补种上；当补种的谷子刚长到两三片叶时，又遭了雹灾，幼苗被冰雹打光了，他们迅速二次补种上；谷子莠穗时，又来了风灾，把正要莠穗的谷苗都吹倒了，他们发动社员把谷苗一根一根扶起来，使谷苗没有误了莠穗；临秋又来了旱灾，由于他们平时锄的勤，杂草少，谷苗没有受大影响。和灾害斗争了四次的结果，每亩产量比全村最好的互助组多产百分之二十六。秋收后社员们都说：“今年不是有了农业生产合作社，累死了也斗不过这四次灾。”农业生产合作社和同样受灾的互助组及个体农民比较，出现了两种不同的收成。如郭玉恩社的一百零二亩玉米田在同样的旱灾情况下，每亩比互助组多收四百零五斤。主要原因就是因为农业生产合作社能统一调配劳动力，集中全力抗旱。
    农业生产合作社多产了粮食，增加了收入，不仅巩固了社的本身，也影响着周围的农民。今年秋收前，还没有亲身体会到社的好处的农民，对参加社抱观望态度，对社能多收粮食不十分相信。一到评比产量时，他们发现谁也没有社的产量高，于是抱观望态度的人都下决心要参加社，不相信社多收粮食的人也信服了。他们说农业生产合作社有四大好处（即工大、粪大、抗灾力量大、农副业收入大）三大统（即能统一计划，能统一使用劳力，统一向土地投资），因此就能普遍施行农业新技术，就有力量向灾害作斗争，所以农业生产合作社的产量一年比一年高。根据长治、长子、平顺等五个县了解的材料：秋收后要求建社和入社的已经有一百三十四个互助组和两千六百零九户农民。
