Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The National Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 12th. Private industrialists and merchants representatives from various regions and fields, after group discussions, thematic discussions, and speeches at the conference, unanimously supported the state's general line and general task for the transition period and the state's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of private industry and commerce. They pledged to unite private industrialists and merchants nationwide in the future, actively engage in business, eliminate the "five poisons," and strive to fulfill the glorious historical task of realizing the general line.

    Through this conference, the representatives further clarified the great significance of the state's general line during the transition period and the gradual completion of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through the path of state capitalism. Many representatives used their own personal experiences to demonstrate that carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through the path of state capitalism is a relatively sound policy and method, which benefits the state, the people, and private industrialists and merchants. The resolution unanimously passed by the representatives clearly pointed out that private industrialists and merchants should, based on the needs and possibilities of the state, actively and consciously move in the direction of state capitalism. Through this conference, the representatives recognized the role, path, and future of private industrialists and merchants in the great historical period of our motherland's gradual transition to a socialist society. The representatives realized that the state attaches importance to private industry and commerce and regards it as an important economic factor. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of national construction and play a role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, private industrialists and merchants must strengthen ideological transformation, strengthen education in patriotism and law-abiding, sincerely accept the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, resolutely eliminate illegal acts such as speculation, tax evasion, and shoddy workmanship, follow the state's planned track, and carry out production increase and thrift, improve business management, improve technology, reduce costs, improve quality, and produce more inexpensive and high-quality goods for national construction and the needs of the people. They must also actively adapt to socialist transformation. In this way, private industrialists and merchants not only have reasonable profits now but also have a bright future.

    In the general discussion before the closing of the conference, 102 representatives, in their speeches, unanimously supported the general line and the state's gradual socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. They also listed the specific facts that their enterprises, after being jointly operated by public and private sectors or accepting state processing orders and unified purchase and marketing, had developed productivity, increased production, improved quality, reduced costs, and rapidly developed their enterprises, with private shareholders benefiting. This illustrated that all forms of state capitalism have greater superiority than private capitalism.

    Amidst warm applause, the conference passed the "Resolution of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference on Accepting and Supporting the Opening Speech by Chairman Chen Shutong and the Speech by Vice-Chairman Li Weihan of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council" (see page 2 of today's newspaper), passed the "Constitution of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce" (see page 2 of today's newspaper), passed the report of the Proposal Examination Committee, the financial review report of the Financial Review Committee, and the budget and the method for members to pay membership fees, and also passed the "Decision on All Levels of Industry and Commerce Federations Joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as Group Members" (see page 2 of today's newspaper). The conference elected Chen Shutong as the Chairman of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Li Zhuchen, Nan Hanchen, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Dixing, Meng Yongqian, Sheng Pihua, Rong Yiren, Fu Huating, Chen Jingshu, Huang Changshui, Hu Ziang, Gong Tianmin, and Li Xiangjiu as Vice-Chairmen. Qian Jiaju and others were elected as 212 Executive Committee Members, and Sha Qianli was elected as Secretary-General.

    When the conference passed the telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and cheers that lasted for a long time. Because of Chairman Mao's leadership, not only has private industry and commerce been developed and transformed, but the path of gradually realizing socialist transformation through state capitalism has also been clarified. Many representatives recognized from their own experiences that following the path indicated by Chairman Mao is the correct and happy path.

    Finally, Li Zhuchen delivered the closing speech to the conference (full text on page 2 of today's newspaper).

    The National Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference, which lasted 21 days, has now successfully concluded.
