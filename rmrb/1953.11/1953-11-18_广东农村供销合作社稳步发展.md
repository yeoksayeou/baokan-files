Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Guangdong's rural supply and marketing cooperatives are developing steadily. Currently, there are over a thousand supply and marketing cooperatives in the province, with more than seven million members. In the past six months, the business of the cooperatives has greatly developed. By the end of September, the province had developed more than five thousand five hundred retail stores, stalls, and mobile supply teams. The amount of various materials purchased and supplied is approximately equivalent to the total amount purchased and supplied throughout last year. During the summer agricultural production period in June and July, this supply and marketing network supplied farmers with more than 3 million dan of fertilizer and nearly 20 billion yuan worth of agricultural implements, and purchased nearly 300 billion yuan worth of agricultural and sideline products. After the expansion of the business of rural supply and marketing cooperatives, it has been supported by the members. The No. 8 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhongshan County has more than 10,000 members, scattered in twelve townships. In the past, this supply and marketing cooperative only had one store, making it very inconvenient for most members to purchase or sell materials. In May, the district cooperative added three stores and two branches, and also set up stalls in various townships on market days to sell goods, which the members were very satisfied with. The farmers also repaired a road to facilitate the cooperative's transportation of goods to the countryside.

    广东农村供销合作社稳步发展
    广东省农村供销合作社稳步发展。现在全省已有一千多个供销合作社，社员七百多万人。近半年来，合作社的业务有很大发展。到九月底止，全省已发展了五千五百多个零售店、货摊和流动供应小组。收购和供应各种物资的数量约相当于去年全年的收购和供应量。六、七月夏季农业生产期间，这个供销网供应了农民三百多万担肥料、近二百亿元的农具和收购了近三千亿元的农副产品。农村供销合作社业务扩大后，得到社员的拥护。中山县八区供销合作社有一万多社员，分散居住在十二个乡，过去这个供销社只有一间门市部，大部分社员购买或出售物资十分不便。五月间区社增设了三个门市部、两间分店，还在集日到各乡去摆摊售货，社员们都很满意。农民并修好了一条大路以便合作社把货物运到农村。　（据新华社讯）
