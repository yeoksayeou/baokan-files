The nationwide fuel industry system's production increase and thrift campaign has penetrated to the grassroots units, achieving some successes. Currently, the production increase and thrift campaign in various units can be roughly divided into three types: The first type involves leadership, based on the original work deployment, making detailed calculations, formulating relatively accurate production increase and thrift plans, and then mobilizing the masses to tap potential and find shortcuts, with good results. Units such as the Tangshan and Liaoyuan Power Bureaus, Tangshan Power Plant, Fushun and Fuxin Mining Bureaus, Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery Gasoline Workshop, and Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 are examples of this approach. All units that have done so have achieved significant results. For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau completed 129.2% of the state plan and 118.2% of the operational plan in September. However, there are not many units of this type. The second type involves bureaus, factories, and mines whose leadership has formulated production increase and thrift plans, but lack specific measures, the masses are not well mobilized, and employees lack enthusiasm. For example, employees of the Jiawang Mining Bureau believe that three-quarters of the time has passed, and the shortfall in production in the first half of the year is large, leading to a lack of confidence. There are more units of this type. There are also a few units where the production increase and thrift plan only circulates among cadres. For example, after the Shijiazhuang Power Bureau received the task assigned by the North China Power Bureau, it only estimated a figure by financial personnel and reported it, without making any specific arrangements for grassroots units. Although there are not many units of this type, the situation is very serious.

Recently, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry dispatched working groups to conduct inspections and found that the production increase and thrift plans of various bureaus, factories, and mines in the North China coal and power industries, as well as the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in the Central-South region, had many problems. The main problems were the crude deployment and calculation of production increase and thrift work, resulting in tasks being cobbled together, increased production, increased costs, and a phenomenon of increasing production and increasing losses. For example, the Datong Mining Bureau initially calculated a production increase and thrift of 13.3 billion yuan and a remittance of 10.6 billion yuan. Later, when the superior instructed the bureau to remit 11 billion yuan, they pieced together the 1 billion yuan profit from over-planned coal washing in the first half of the year. The Yangquan Mining Bureau initially calculated a production increase of 3.4 billion yuan while requesting the approval of superiors to increase equipment such as electric chutes, winches, and steel rails, estimated to cost about 3.9 billion yuan. This means that the profits that can be produced are not even enough for self-use, and the state needs to subsidize an additional 500 million yuan. This inspection found that even the 3.4 billion yuan was a false account, and the actual production increase and thrift was only 1.7 billion yuan. In addition, there is a serious phenomenon of large surface figures and small remittances of profits.

The inspection also found that some coal mines are still following the past management methods of "large-scale coal production," organizing cadres and technicians to go down the well for a concentrated effort to complete the production increase task. Some coal mines have not yet reversed the past situation of lagging tunneling work. The tunneling work of the Fushun Mining Bureau has always been relatively good, but now tunneling cannot keep up with mining. The coal quality of Kailuan Coal Mine declined in late September, with ash content reaching 26.03%. Accidents are also gradually increasing. The number of casualties in coal mines in October increased compared to September, and some coal mine cadres even said, "It's better to have some accidents than to fail to complete the task!" Some power outages and mechanical accidents have also occurred in the power and petroleum systems. In terms of capital construction, there is also a serious phenomenon of declining quality. For example, some workers in the Fuxin Fourth Construction Site "put dry bricks on the wall," seriously affecting the quality of the project.

In order to solve the existing problems and promote the further healthy development of the movement, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry has issued instructions requiring leading cadres of various bureaus, factories, and mines to first clearly recognize that the production increase and thrift movement must be based on strengthening overall planning management and implementing a comprehensive responsibility system, combining leadership with the masses and technicians with workers, in order to promote the correct and healthy development of the movement. Secondly, leaders at all levels must comprehensively grasp the production increase and thrift plan, and must ensure that the plan is realistic and oppose false phenomena; phenomena such as only paying attention to output and neglecting quality, pursuing tasks and neglecting safety, eating into tunneling, gnawing at machines (not repairing, less lubricating oil), and adopting wrong methods in order to complete tasks are not allowed and must be checked and corrected in a timely and serious manner. Thirdly, it is necessary to further mobilize the masses, not only workers but also all technicians and managers, to improve technology and strengthen management. Fourthly, while comprehensively and balancedly completing this year's tasks, it is also necessary to pay close attention to the continuity of production and actively prepare for next year's production in terms of tunneling, maintenance, technical measures, labor organization, and material supply, correcting various erroneous ideas and practices that only take into account this year and not next year. Fifthly, leading cadres at all levels should go deep into the workshops to mobilize the masses according to actual needs, formulate specific action plans, and promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences with decisive significance to promote the development of the movement.

### 燃料工业部深入检查增产节约情况

    燃料工业部深入检查增产节约情况
    全国燃料工业系统增产节约运动已经深入到基层单位，获得了一定的成绩。目前各单位增产节约运动大体可分为三种类型：第一类是在原来工作部署的基础上，领导方面经过算细账，制订了较确切的增产节约计划，进而发动群众，挖潜力，找窍门，效果很好。唐山、辽源电业局、唐山发电厂、抚顺、阜新矿务局、玉门矿务局炼油厂汽油车间、东北石油一厂等单位，就是这样作的。凡是这样作的单位都收到了显著的成绩，如抚顺矿务局九月份完成国家计划的百分之一百二十九点二，完成作业计划的百分之一百一十八点二。但这一类的单位不多。第二类，各局、厂矿领导上虽已制订了增产节约计划，但是缺乏具体措施计划，群众没有很好发动起来，职工劲头不大，如贾汪矿务局的职工认为时间已过了四分之三，上半年欠产数字又大，信心很不足。这一类单位较多。还有少数单位增产节约计划只在干部中间打圈子，如石家庄电业局接到华北区电业局布置的任务后，仅由财务人员估计了一个数字就上报了，对基层单位根本没有作任何具体布置。这一类的单位虽然不多，但情况是很严重的。
    最近，中央燃料工业部特派出工作组进行检查，发现华北区煤业、电业各局、厂矿以及中南区焦作矿务局等单位的增产节约计划存在很多问题，主要表现在对增产节约布置与计算工作做得粗糙，发生凑任务，增加生产，提高成本，越增产、越亏损的现象。如大同矿务局开始计算增产节约一百三十三亿元，上缴一百零六亿元，后来上级指示该局必须上缴一百一十亿元时，他们就把上半年选煤超计划所得利润十亿元拼凑进去。阳泉矿务局开始计算增产三十四亿元，同时要求上级批准增加电溜子、卷扬机、钢轨等设备，估计约需三十九亿元，这就是说，可生产的利润尚不足自用，还需要国家另外补贴五亿元。这次检查发现，就连那三十四亿元也是虚账，实际仅能增产节约十七亿元。此外，还有表面数字大、上缴利润小的严重现象。
    在检查中还发现有些煤矿仍因袭过去“大出煤”的管理方法，组织干部、技术人员一齐下井突击，完成增产任务。有的煤矿还未扭转过去掘进工作落后的局面，抚顺矿务局的掘进工作一向是较好的，但现在掘进赶不上回采。开滦煤矿九月下旬的煤质下降，灰粉达到百分之二十六点零三。事故也逐渐增加，煤矿十月份伤亡事故比九月份增加了，有的煤矿干部还说：“出点事故也比完不成任务好！”电业和石油系统也发生了一些停电和机械事故。在基本建设方面，也同样存在着质量下降的严重现象，如阜新第四工地有的工人就“干砖上墙”，严重影响了工程质量。
    为了解决目前存在的这些问题，使运动进一步健康地发展下去，中央燃料工业部特发出指示，要求各局、厂矿领导干部首先应该明确认识到：增产节约运动必需是在加强全面的计划管理与贯彻全面责任制的前提下，使领导与群众相结合，技术人员与工人相结合，才能使运动正确地、健康地向前发展。其次，各级领导必须全面地掌握增产节约计划，务必使计划切合实际，反对虚假现象；只顾产量，忽视质量，追求任务，忽视安全，吃掘进，啃机器（不检修、少注油）以及为了完成任务，采取错误方法等现象是不能允许的，必须及时认真检查纠正。第三、必须进一步发动群众，不仅要发动工人，还要发动所有的技术人员和管理人员，提高技术，加强管理。第四、在全面地均衡地完成今年任务的同时，还必须十分注意生产的连续性，积极从掘进、检修、技术措施、劳动组织、器材供应等方面，为明年生产作好准备工作，纠正只顾今年不顾明年的各种错误思想和作法。第五、各级领导干部要根据实际需要，深入车间发动群众，订出具体行动计划，并且要及时总结、推广带有决定意义的先进经验，推动运动的发展。
