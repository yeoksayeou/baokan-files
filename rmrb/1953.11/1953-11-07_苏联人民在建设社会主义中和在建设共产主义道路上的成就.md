    The Soviet people, together with hundreds of millions of people in the democratic camp and all sincere friends of peace and democracy in capitalist countries, celebrate the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution on November 7, 1953. The great October Socialist Revolution ended the era of capitalist dominance in the world and opened a new era in history—the era of socialism.

    In October 1917, the Russian working class, united with the laboring peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by the brilliant revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin, overthrew the regime of landlords and capitalists, destroyed the bourgeois state machinery, and founded the world's first worker-peasant Soviet socialist state.

    A fundamental transformation occurred not only in the fate of Russia, but also in the fate of all mankind and in the history of the world. The shackles of economic and political dependence on the capitalist world were shattered in our country. The world imperialist front was breached. The Soviet socialist state became a bright beacon for the oppressed and impoverished working people of the world, illuminating their path to liberation from capitalist enslavement.

    Over the past thirty-six years, our socialist motherland has traversed a glorious path of heroic struggle and brilliant victories. Neither economic destruction, nor the famine caused by economic destruction, nor the civil war, nor the armed intervention of fourteen capitalist countries against the young Soviet Republic, nor economic blockades, nor the countless conspiracies of internal enemies, spies, traitors, and saboteurs in the Soviet Union—none of these have been able to stop the victorious march of the revolution.

    The great achievements our country has made in the struggle against internal enemies and in the development of the economy and culture are due to the Communist Party's powerful organizational and educational work, and to the Party's wise Leninist-Stalinist policies.

    In the Soviet Union, socialism was built and the exploiting classes were completely eliminated thanks to the realization of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. For the first time in history, the phenomenon of human exploitation was forever eradicated. In 1936, the victory of socialism was explicitly defined in the new Constitution, which demonstrated the world-historical significance of the fact that the Soviet people, after building socialism, entered a new period of development, a period of completing the construction of socialist society and gradually transitioning to communism.

    On the basis of the socialist victory in our country, the immense driving forces of the Soviet society's spiritual and political unity, the friendship of all nationalities, and Soviet patriotism which conforms to the national traditions of all nationalities and the overall vital interests of all working people in the Soviet Union, developed and strengthened.

    The anti-Soviet war launched by Hitlerite fascism was a severe test for our country. Hitler and many Western powers expected the Soviet state to collapse under the onslaught of the fascist war machine. These expectations were shattered like soap bubbles. The leading imperialist figures who harbored these delusions did not consider that the historical facts of the fragility of bourgeois multinational states were completely inapplicable to the Soviet state—a new type of state.

    As a result, instead of being destroyed or weakened, the Soviet Union was strengthened, and its international prestige increased. Instead of the democratic forces in Central and Southeastern Europe being weakened and crushed, people's democratic systems were established. A new and tremendous upsurge of national liberation struggles was unleashed in the colonies and dependent countries. The historic victory of the great Chinese people dealt a heavy blow to the world imperialist system. In China, power is in the hands of the broad masses of the people led by the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. Now, one-third of humanity has broken free from imperialist oppression and liberated itself from the shackles of imperialist exploitation.

    The post-war period is a period of further weakening of the world capitalist system and the growing strength of democratic and socialist forces.

    In the political sphere, the post-war period saw the formation of two camps: an aggressive, anti-democratic camp headed by the United States, and a peace-loving, democratic camp. During this period, a new center of reaction and aggression took shape in the capitalist world—the United States. Now, the main threat to peace, freedom, and the national independence of all peoples comes from there.

    In the post-war years, the working people, using the form of mass socialist competition, achieved remarkable achievements in peaceful, creative labor and in the implementation of communist construction plans. This clearly demonstrates the enormous superiority of the Soviet social system and state system, and the powerful strength of the friendship among all nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    Responding to the call of Soviet Government Leader Malenkov in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people greet the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with new achievements in communist construction and in a great upsurge in political and production spheres.

    The tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the USSR, which present a bright prospect for the further rise of the socialist economy and culture, are being successfully fulfilled. In the first half of 1953, all industries completed the production plan for output. Industrial output in the first half of this year increased by ten percent compared with the first half of last year. Industrial output in 1953 will be about two and a half times that of the pre-war year of 1940.

    Now our country has a strong and technologically complete heavy industry. The proportion of heavy industry, like in pre-revolutionary Russia, accounted for only one-third of the total industrial output in the 1924-25 economic year. Due to the Party's adoption of the policy of national industrialization at the time, its proportion has now reached almost 70 percent of the total industrial output.

    For the twenty-eight years since the Fourteenth Congress of the Communist Party, the Party has consistently implemented the general line of national industrialization, which can guarantee the economic independence and self-reliance of our country, consolidate national defense, and create the necessary conditions for the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union. During this period, industrial output increased twenty-eight times. Now steel production has increased twenty times compared with the 1924-25 fiscal year, coal has increased eighteen times, and electricity has increased forty-four times. If the Soviet Union only smelted 1,868,000 tons of steel in the 1924-25 fiscal year, then more than 38 million tons of steel will be smelted in 1953. If only 16.5 million tons of coal were mined in the 1924-25 fiscal year, then more than 320 million tons of coal will be mined in 1953, an increase of 93 percent compared with 1940.

    The significance of electrification is particularly important in the cause of communist construction. According to Lenin's brilliant definition: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."

    If power stations generated less than 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in the 1924-25 fiscal year, then the electricity generated by power stations in 1953 will increase to 133 billion kilowatt-hours, 2.8 times that of 1940.

    Our country has also achieved great achievements in the production of daily necessities.

    The production situation in 1953 is as follows: 5.3 billion meters of cotton fabric, an increase of 34 percent compared with 1940; more than 200 million meters of woolen fabric, an increase of about 70 percent compared with 1940; more than 400 million meters of silk fabric, an increase of more than four times compared with 1940; 3.6 million tons of sugar, an increase of almost 70 percent compared with 1940; 400,000 tons of animal oil, almost an increase of 80 percent compared with the pre-war level.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our country has established a collective farm system and a socialist agriculture with the largest scale and the highest level of mechanization in the world. Now, our socialist agricultural system includes 94,000 collective farms, 8,950 machine tractor stations, and more than 4,700 state farms.

    The Party and the government are constantly concerned about the development of agriculture, and concerned about supplying agriculture with first-class technology to mechanize agricultural work. Now there are 969,000 tractors (each tractor is calculated with 15 horsepower), 255,000 grain harvesting combines, and many other machines in machine tractor stations. The total number of public livestock and poultry has been expanded in collective farms and state farms. Our country has sufficient grain. The state's reserves of cotton, sugar beets, and livestock products have significantly increased compared with the pre-war period.

    Due to the increase in monetary wages, the six reductions in the prices of food and industrial products, and the increase in various state allocations to residents, the real wages of workers and staff have been greatly increased. The monetary and in-kind income of collective farmers has also increased.

    The Soviet government allocates a large amount of funds to social and cultural undertakings. In 1953, 62.1 billion rubles were allocated to education, 24.9 billion rubles were allocated to the development of healthcare and sports, and 42.9 billion rubles were allocated to social insurance and government subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers. This year, the funds allocated to housing construction are 25 percent more than in 1952.

    In our country, every citizen has ample opportunity to receive various educations, up to higher education. Illiteracy has long been eliminated in the country. While implementing universal seven-year education, secondary education is being expanded on the basis of ten-year education, with the aim of changing universal seven-year education to universal secondary education in the capital cities of each republic, cities directly under the republic, central cities of states and border regions, and large industrial centers by the end of the Five-Year Plan.

    The total number of students in seven-year schools and secondary schools increased by 900,000 in 1953. In the Soviet Union, 1,548,000 people are studying in secondary specialized schools, and 1,527,000 people are studying in higher education institutions.

    In our country, workers and staff enjoy annual leave with pay, receive sick leave benefits, old-age and disability pensions, and free or reduced-price sanatorium treatment every year. All citizens of the Soviet Union can enjoy free medical care.

    The terrible disaster of unemployment in capitalist countries does not exist in our country. Our national economy constantly feels not a surplus of labor, but a shortage. The number of workers and staff in industry, agriculture, construction, and transportation increased by 1,030,000 in the first half of 1953 compared with the same period in 1952, and the number of workers and staff in educational institutions, scientific research institutions, and medical institutions increased by 120,000. Labor productivity is constantly increasing.

    Our Party has always unswervingly pursued the policy of comprehensively developing heavy industry, regarding it as a necessary condition for the smooth development of the national economy. Today, when great achievements have been made in the development of heavy industry, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have comprehensively put forward the task of rapidly increasing the production of daily consumer goods, because the output in this area cannot yet meet the growing needs of residents.

    The Party and the government have put forward the urgent task of greatly increasing the supply of food and industrial products to residents within two to three years.

    The measures currently being implemented by the Party and the government to accelerate the development of light industry and the food industry, to further develop and improve agriculture, and to expand and improve Soviet trade, provide a guarantee for the successful completion of the task of maximizing the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. There is no doubt that this program of great historical significance will be successfully realized.

    The Soviet Union possesses all the necessary conditions for building communism. The Soviet Union has established the most advanced social and state systems. The Soviet state possesses inexhaustible natural resources to benefit the people. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, following the ideas of the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism and relying on the rich experience of socialist construction, organizes and mobilizes the Soviet people to engage in the struggle to further improve the national economy. The Soviet people, forever united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, are confidently marching towards the path of communism and are fighting with unabated energy for world peace.

    The achievements of the entire democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have aroused the bestial hatred and loathing of the imperialists, the mortal enemies of peace and democracy. The US aggressor group is trying to hinder the solution of all outstanding issues. They are establishing military bases in the West and the East, organizing various provocations, implementing a policy of atomic blackmail, and openly implementing a "cold war" policy.

    But the people of all countries do not want war. Hundreds of millions of people have united in the movement to defend peace in order to oppose war. Stalin said: If the peoples of all countries take on the cause of safeguarding peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. These wise words of his have increasingly penetrated the hearts of the broad masses of people.

    Thanks to the persistent efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire democratic camp, and thanks to the struggle of the broad masses of people in all countries of the world to defend and consolidate peace, significant achievements have been made in easing international tensions in recent times.

    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have been united by great and unbreakable friendship. Comrade Malenkov, the leader of the Soviet government, said: "Now the People's Republic of China appears as a strong and stable factor in the Asian and Pacific regions. The masters of aggression are furious because China will never again be their object of exploitation and exploitation, because China has not only formally but also practically achieved sovereignty, because China does not appear on the international stage as a small role looking at other people's faces, but is implementing its own independent and autonomous policy. Another great power has appeared in the world, and this great power, together with all peace-loving forces, is working together to consolidate peace and international security."

    Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, wrote: "The friendship between the people of the great Soviet Union and China is unbreakable because our friendship is based on the great internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China and the people of all people's democracies, and the friendship between all peace-loving, democratic, and just people in all countries of the world, are also based on such great internationalist principles, and therefore are unbreakable."

    Our country's experience in successfully building communism has extremely important international significance. The fraternal Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries in the world are learning from this experience.

    The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries. At the same time, it also considers the threat of new aggression from arrogant warmongers. Therefore, it is strengthening and will strengthen its national defense forces and prepare to give any aggressor a devastating counterattack at any time.

    The peace and democratic camp, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, uniting one-third of the world's population, will be consolidated in an unprecedented way!

    The ranks of fighters for peace are growing and consolidating day by day. This rank is a powerful, invincible force capable of stopping warmongers.

    苏联人民在建设社会主义中和在建设共产主义道路上的成就
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席
    麦·塔拉索夫
    一九五三年十一月七日，苏联各民族和民主阵营的亿万人民以及资本主义各国和平民主的全体真诚的朋友们一道，来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年；伟大的十月社会主义革命结束了资本主义独霸世界的时代、开辟了历史的新纪元——社会主义的纪元。
    俄国工人阶级与劳动农民联合在一起，在以天才的革命领袖列宁和斯大林为首的共产党的领导下，在一九一七年十月推翻了地主和资本家的政权，摧毁了资产阶级的国家机器，创立了世界上第一个工农苏维埃社会主义国家。
    不仅在俄国的命运中，而且在全人类的命运中、在全世界的历史中起了根本的转变。我国在经济上和政治上依赖于资本主义世界的枷锁被粉碎了。世界帝国主义阵线被突破了。苏维埃社会主义国家成为全世界被压迫的和贫困的劳动人民的光明的灯塔，照耀着他们从资本主义奴役中求得解放的道路。
    我们的社会主义祖国在过去三十六年中经历了英勇斗争和辉煌胜利的光荣道路。无论是经济的破坏，无论是由经济破坏所引起的饥馑，无论是国内战争，无论是十四个资本主义国家对年青的苏维埃共和国的武装干涉，无论是经济封锁，无论是苏联内部敌人、奸细、叛徒和破坏者的无数阴谋，所有这些都没有能够阻止革命的胜利进军。
    我国在与国内敌人的斗争中、在经济和文化的发展中所取得的巨大成就，归功于共产党的强有力的组织工作和教育工作，归功于党的列宁斯大林的英明政策。
    在苏联，由于社会主义国家工业化和农业集体化的实现，建成了社会主义，彻底肃清了剥削阶级。人剥削人的现象在历史上第一次永远被消灭了。一九三六年，社会主义的胜利在新宪法中被明文确定下来，新宪法表明了这样一个世界历史意义的事实：苏联人民在建成社会主义以后，进入了新的发展时期，进入了完成社会主义社会建设和逐步向共产主义过渡的时期。
    在我国社会主义胜利的基础上，苏联社会精神上和政治上的一致、各族人民的友谊和符合各族人民的民族传统与苏联全体劳动人民总的切身利益的苏维埃爱国主义这些巨大的动力发展了和加强了。
    希特勒法西斯主义发动的反苏战争，对于我国是一个严重的考验。希特勒和许多西方列强的政客都预期苏维埃国家会在法西斯主义战车的攻击下垮台。这些指望都像肥皂泡一样破灭了。曾经怀过这种妄想的帝国主义首脑人物没有估计到，资产阶级多民族国家不牢固性的史实，对于苏维埃国家——新型的国家来说，是完全不适用的。
    结果，不是苏联被消灭或被削弱了，而是苏联的力量加强了，苏联的国际威望提高了。不是中欧和东南欧各国的民主力量被削弱和被粉碎了，而是人民民主制度确立了。在殖民地和附属国掀起了民族解放斗争的新的巨大的高潮。伟大的中国人民的历史性的胜利给全世界帝国主义体系以沉重的打击。在中国，政权掌握在以工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党所领导的广大人民群众的手里。现在已经有三分之一的人类挣脱了帝国主义的压迫，从帝国主义剥削的桎梏中解放出来。
    战后时期是世界资本主义体系进一步削弱和民主与社会主义力量日益壮大的时期。
    在政治方面，战后时期形成了两个阵营，一个是以美国为首的侵略的、反民主的阵营，一个是爱好和平的、民主的阵营。在这个时期，在资本主义世界中形成了一个新的反动和侵略的中心，这个中心就是美国。现在，对于和平、自由和各国人民的民族独立的主要威胁就是从那里来的。
    在战后的年代里，劳动人民使用了群众性的社会主义竞赛的形式，在和平的、创造性的劳动中，在共产主义建设计划的实施中，取得了卓越的成就，这就清楚地表现出了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的巨大优越性，表现出了苏联各族人民友谊的强大力量。
    苏联人民响应苏联政府领袖马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说和苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会决议的号召，他们用在共产主义建设方面、在政治的和生产的巨大高涨方面的新成就，来迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年。
    给社会主义经济和文化的进一步高涨展示出光辉远景的苏联发展第五个五年计划的任务，正在被顺利地完成着。一九五三年上半年度全部工业完成了产量的生产计划。今年上半年工业产量较去年上半年提高了百分之十。一九五三年的工业产量将约为战前一九四○年的二倍半。
    现在我国有着强大的、技术上完备的重工业。重工业的比重，在一九二四——二五经济年度里，也和革命前的俄国一样，只占工业生产总量的三分之一，由于当时党采取了国家工业化的方针，现在它的比重差不多已达到工业生产总量的百分之七十了。
    自共产党第十四次代表大会以来的二十八年中，党始终一贯地执行了能够保证我国经济独立自主的国家工业化的总路线，巩固了国防力量并创立了社会主义在苏联胜利的必要条件。在此期间，工业产量增加了二十八倍。现在钢的产量较一九二四——二五年度增加了二十倍，煤增加了十八倍，电力增加了四十四倍。如果说苏联在一九二四——二五年度仅炼钢一百八十六万八千吨，那么一九五三炼出的钢将在三千八百万吨以上。如果说在一九二四——二五年度只采煤一千六百五十万吨，那么一九五三年采出的煤将在三亿二千万吨以上，如与一九四○年相较，则增加了百分之九十三。
    电气化的意义在共产主义的建设事业中显得特别重大。按照列宁的天才的定义：“共产主义，就是苏维埃政权加全国电气化。”
    如果说在一九二四——二五年度电力站所发的电还不到三十亿瓩时，那么一九五三年电力站所发的电将增加到一千三百三十亿瓩时，为一九四○年的二点八倍。
    我国在日用品生产方面也达到了巨大的成就。
    一九五三年的生产情况如下：棉织品为五十三亿公尺，比一九四○年增加了百分之三十四，毛织品为二亿公尺以上，比一九四○年约增加百分之七十，丝织品为四亿公尺以上，比一九四○年增加四倍多，糖为三百六十万吨，比一九四○年几乎增加百分之七十，动物为四十万吨，比战前水平几增加百分之八十。
    在共产党的领导下，我国建立了集体农庄制度，建立了世界上规模最大的机械化水平最高的社会主义农业。现在，我国的社会主义农业制度包括九万四千个集体农庄，八千九百五十个机器拖拉机站和四千七百多个国营农场。
    党和政府不断地关怀农业的发展，关怀以头等技术供给农业而使农业工作机械化。现在在机器拖拉机站有九十六万九千部拖拉机（每一部拖拉机以十五匹马力计算），二十五万五千部谷物收割联合机和其他许多机器。在集体农庄和国营农场扩大了公共牲畜和家禽总头数。我国获有充分的粮食。国家储备的棉花、糖萝卜和畜产品与战前相比显著地增加了。
    由于货币工资的提高，粮食和工业品价格的六次降低，国家对居民的各种拨款的增加，大大提高了职工的实际工资。集体农民的货币和实物的收入也增加了。
    苏联政府把大量的资金用于社会和文化事业。一九五三年，拨给教育事业的款项为六百二十一亿卢布，拨给发展保健事业和体育事业的款项为二百四十九亿卢布，拨给社会保险事业和政府对儿女众多的母亲和单身母亲的补助款项为四百二十九亿卢布。今年拨给住宅建筑的款项比一九五二年多百分之二十五。
    在我国，每一个公民都有充分的可能受到各种教育，直到高等教育。在国内，早已扫除了文盲。与实现普及的七年制教育的同时，在十年制教育的基础上扩大着中等教育，其目的是使五年计划结束时，在各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、州、边疆区的中心城市以及大工业中心，把七年制普及教育改为中等普及教育。
    七年制学校和中等学校的学生的总数，在一九五三年增加了九十万。在苏联，一百五十四万八千人在中等专科学校学习，一百五十二万七千人在高等学校学习。
    在我国，工人和职员每年都享有保留原薪的休假，可以领取疾病补助金，年老和残废的抚恤金，免费的或减价的疗养。苏联的全体公民都可以享有免费医疗。
    资本主义国家的可怕的失业灾难在我国是没有的。我们的国民经济经常所感到的不是劳动力的多余，而是不足。在工业、农业、建筑业和运输业各方面，工人和职员的数量，一九五三年上半年和一九五二年同期相比，增加了一百零三万人，在教育机关、科学研究机关和医疗机关方面增加了十二万人，劳动生产率在不断地提高着。
    我们的党始终不渝地推行着全面发展重工业的方针，把它看作顺利发展国民经济的必要条件。在重工业的发展已经获得了巨大的成就的今天，共产党和苏联政府全面地提出了必须使日用消费品的生产获得急速高涨的任务，因为在这方面的产量现在还不能满足居民的日益增长的需要。
    党和政府提出了这样一个迫切任务，要在两三年内大大增加对居民的粮食和工业品的供应。
    现在党和政府在加速发展轻工业和食品工业方面，在进一步发展和提高农业以及在扩大和改善苏联贸易方面所实行的措施，就是为顺利完成最大限度地满足整个社会不断增长着的物质和文化需要的任务提供了保证。毫无疑问，这个具有巨大历史意义的纲领将会顺利实现。
    苏联拥有建成共产主义的一切必要条件。苏联建立了最先进的社会制度和国家制度。苏维埃国家拥有用来为人民造福的取之不竭的天然富源。苏联共产党遵循着战无不胜的马克思列宁主义理论的思想，依靠着社会主义建设的丰富经验，组织和动员苏联人民从事进一步提高国民经济的斗争。永远团结在共产党和苏联政府周围的苏联人民，正满怀信心地走向共产主义的道路，并以毫不减弱的精力为全世界和平而斗争。
    以苏联为首的整个民主阵营的成就引起了帝国主义者，和平与民主的死敌们的野兽般的仇恨和憎恶。美国侵略集团竭力阻碍解决一切悬而未决的问题。他们在西方和东方建立军事基地，组织各种挑衅行动，执行原子讹诈政策，公开实行“冷战”政策。
    但各国人民并不要战争。为了反对战争，亿万人民已在保卫和平运动中团结起来。斯大林曾说过：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。他这几句英明的话已愈益深入到广大人民群众的心中。
    由于苏联、中华人民共和国、整个民主阵营的坚持努力，由于世界各国广大人民群众为保卫和巩固和平而进行的斗争，在最近一段时期中，缓和国际紧张局势的工作已获得了重大成就。
    苏联和中华人民共和国已由伟大的和牢不可破的友谊联结了起来。苏联政府领袖马林科夫同志说：“现在中华人民共和国以强大的稳定因素出现于亚洲和太平洋区域。专事侵略的大师们动了肝火，因为中国永远不再是他们鱼肉和剥削的对象了，因为中国不只是形式上、而且是实际上取得了主权，因为中国不是以看别人颜色的小角色出现在国际舞台上，而是执行着自己的独立自主的政策。世界上出现了又一个大国，这个大国跟一切爱好和平的力量在一起，共同为巩固和平与国际安全而努力。”
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志写道：“伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。中苏两国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，和全世界各国一切爱好和平、民主及正义的人民之间的友谊，也正是建立在这样伟大的国际主义原则上，因此，也就是牢不可破的。”
  我国胜利地建设共产主义的经验，具有极重大的国际意义。世界各国的兄弟共产党和工人党都在学习这个经验。
    苏联一贯地推行着同一切国家和平合作的政策。同时它也估计到来自狂妄的战争贩子方面的新的侵略的威胁。所以它现在加强将来也要加强自己的国防力量，做好准备工作以便随时给任何侵略者以毁灭性的反击。
    以伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为首、联合了世界三分之一人口的和平民主阵营将空前巩固的团结起来！
    争取和平的战士们的阵容正在日益成长和巩固。这个阵容是一个强大的、不可战胜的、能够制止战争贩子的力量。
