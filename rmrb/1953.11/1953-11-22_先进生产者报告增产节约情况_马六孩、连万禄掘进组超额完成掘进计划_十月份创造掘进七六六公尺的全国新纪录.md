Advanced Producers Report Production Increase and Savings
Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu Excavation Teams Exceed Excavation Plan
Creating a New National Record of 766 Meters Excavated in October

    A letter from the Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu Rapid Excavation Teams of the Datong Coal Mine: In the October production increase and savings competition, we displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and collective wisdom, creating a new national excavation record and exceeding the progress plan for the first month of the fourth quarter competition.

    From October 3rd to October 31st, over 29 working days, our rapid excavation team excavated a total of 766 meters and 70 centimeters in a multi-hole tunnel that was 3 meters wide and 2 meters high. (Editor's note: In the letter published on October 12th, in which the Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu excavation team of Datong Coal Mine challenged mines across the country, the statement "successfully completed 703 meters in September" was, according to a letter from the Datong Mining Area Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union, a calculation error by the recorder and should be changed to "successfully completed 661.42 meters in September.") Except for the savings on explosives and detonators, which did not meet the planned target due to water in the tunnel, all other items were completed according to or exceeded the planned targets.

    When formulating the October work plan, our team further studied and solved the two key problems of speeding up drilling time and improving transportation efficiency. Regarding the drilling work method, previously, our team's three drilling workers worked together in one tunnel. After drilling, they would then divide the work to load explosives, detonate, and tidy up tools before moving to another tunnel together. This resulted in a low cycle rate and idle labor. After research, we implemented a flow-line operation method for drilling and blasting. The specific method is: workers A and B drill in tunnel A, and after drilling, they immediately move to tunnel B to drill. Tunnel A is handed over to another person to load explosives and detonate. By the time tunnel A is detonated, tunnel B has just finished a round of drilling. By circulating in this way, one more round of blasting can be done per shift. In terms of improving transportation efficiency, after discussion by the entire team, the labor organization was adjusted, a small-group responsibility system was implemented, and the transportation track was further repaired and switches were added. This improved transportation efficiency and ensured that drilling work was not affected.

    During the competition, our team further improved the production meetings, using them to study and solve the problems encountered in production. This played a significant role in completing the production increase and savings plan. For example, at a production meeting on October 16th, it was found that the reason why Ma Guo-fu's team had not completed the plan for the first half of the month was a problem with the transportation workers in the allocation of railcars, and they had not maintained close contact with the drilling workers. After improvement, the plan for the second half of the month was exceeded by 115.4 percent. Also, at our production meeting, we discussed the problem of how to drill when encountering "stone nodules" during excavation. It was decided that when encountering "stone nodules," drilling should be stopped, the coal outside the "stone nodules" should be removed first, and the "stone nodules" should be handled before continuing drilling. This avoided both "blank shots" (detonations that do not break down coal) and ensured the safety of the tools, improving the quality of the coal.

    In addition, at the beginning of October, we signed a collective contract with the administrative side, obtained strong support from the administrative leadership, and solved the problems of ventilation and timely supply of railcars. This ensured the smooth development of the team competition.

    In October, although we achieved some results in excavation, we had waste in the use of explosives and detonators and did not fully complete the plan. Therefore, we must, on the road to victory, guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to move forward, and strive to reduce the consumption of explosives and detonators below the target in November, giving the motherland more contributions in the production increase and savings movement.

    先进生产者报告增产节约情况
    马六孩、连万禄掘进组超额完成掘进计划
    十月份创造掘进七六六公尺的全国新纪录
    大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组来信：我们在十月份的增产节约竞赛中，发挥了高度的劳动热情和集体智慧，创造了全国掘进新纪录，超额完成了第四季度竞赛计划的第一个月的进度计划。
    从十月三日到三十一日二十九个工作日中，我们快速掘进组在三公尺宽、二公尺高的多孔道掘进巷，共掘进七百六十六公尺七十公分。（编者按：十月十二日所刊大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄掘进组向全国各矿挑战的来信，其中“在九月份胜利地完成七○三公尺”，据中国煤矿工会大同矿区委员会来信称，系记录员计算错误，应改为“在九月份胜利地完成六六一点四二公尺”。）除节约炮药和雷管一项因巷道有水未达到计划指标外，其他各项都按计划指标完成或超额完成。
    我们组在制订十月份作业计划时，进一步研究并解决了加快打眼时间和提高运搬效率两个关键问题。在打眼工作方法上，以前我们组每班三个打眼工是共同在一个巷道内进行工作的，打完眼以后再分工装炮、放炮和整理工具，然后才一同转入另一巷道。这样，循环次数低，有窝工现象。经过研究，我们推行了打眼放炮流水作业法。具体作法是：甲乙二人在甲巷打眼，打完后即转入乙巷打眼，甲巷交给另一人装炮、放炮。当甲巷放完炮后，正好乙巷也打完一茬眼。这样循环操作，每班即可多打一茬炮。在提高运搬效率方面，经过了全组工人的讨论，调整了劳动组织，实行了分小组专责制，进一步整修了运搬道和增设了道叉。这样便提高了运搬效率，保证了打眼工作不受影响。
    在竞赛中，我们组进一步开好了生产会议，通过生产会议研究和解决生产中所遇到的问题。这对完成增产节约计划起了很大的作用。如十月十六日的一次生产会议上，检查出马国富小组没有完成上半月计划的原因是运搬工在车皮调拨上有毛病，和打眼工没有取得密切联系；经改进后，下半月就超额完成计划的百分之一百一十五点四。又如我们在生产会议上讨论了掘进中遇到“石?”如何打眼的问题，确定遇到“石?”时便停止打眼，先取出  “石?”外边的煤，把“石?”处理后再继续打眼。这样既避免放“空枪”（放炮打不下煤），也保证了工具的安全，提高了煤的质量。
    此外，十月初，我们和行政方面订立了集体合同，取得了行政领导方面的有力支持，解决了通风和及时供应车皮问题。这样就保证了小组竞赛的顺利开展。
    十月份，我们在掘进方面虽然取得了一些成绩，可是我们在炮药、雷管的使用方面有了浪费，没有做到全面完成计划。因此，我们一定要在胜利的道路上，戒骄戒躁，继续前进，争取在十一月份把炮药、雷管消耗降低到指标以下，在增产节约运动中给祖国以更多的贡献。
