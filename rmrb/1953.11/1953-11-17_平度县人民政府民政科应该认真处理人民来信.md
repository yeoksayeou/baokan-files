    The Civil Affairs Section of the Pingdu County People's Government Should Seriously Handle Letters from the People
    A letter from revolutionary soldier Hou Fayue: The Civil Affairs Section of Pingdu County, Shandong Province, adopts a perfunctory attitude towards letters from the people. In August 1952, I reported to the section the illegal and undisciplined acts of village cadres in Hewa Village, Liyuan District, beating the masses and military dependents. After talking with the responsible comrade of the section three times, he promised to investigate and deal with it immediately. After I returned to the army, the village cadres retaliated even more, forcing my sixty-year-old father to stand guard and watch the night in the middle of the night while he was ill. Therefore, I wrote to the County Civil Affairs Section, requesting a speedy resolution. However, I sent many letters in succession, but I never received a reply. After my constant urging, the Civil Affairs Section of the Pingdu County People's Government finally replied to me in February of this year, stating that they would guarantee to conduct an immediate investigation and handle it, and would inform me of the results as soon as it was completed. However, they still have not dealt with this issue until now. I request the Civil Affairs Section of Pingdu County to examine its erroneous attitude towards letters from the people and to promptly deal with the problem I reported.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    平度县人民政府民政科应该认真处理人民来信
    革命军人侯法岳来信：山东省平度县民政科对人民来信采取敷衍了事的态度。一九五二年八月，我向该科揭发该县李园区河洼村村干部捆打群众和军属的违法乱纪事实。经先后与该科负责同志面谈三次，他答应马上调查处理。我回部队后，村干部更施行报复，逼我六十多岁的父亲带病在深夜站岗打更。因此，我就写信给县民政科，要求迅速处理。可是，接连去了好多封信，总是不见回信。在我不断催问下，直到今年二月，平度县人民政府民政科才给我回信，表示保证立即进行调查处理，一旦处理完毕，即将结果告诉我。但是，直到现在他们对这个问题仍旧没有处理。我要求平度县民政科检查对待人民来信的错误态度，并迅速处理我所反映的问题。
