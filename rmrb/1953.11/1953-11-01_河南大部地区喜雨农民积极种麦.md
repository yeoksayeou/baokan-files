In most areas of Henan Province, three rains fell between October 5th and 27th. In more than twenty counties across the province, the soil has been thoroughly moistened or has become moistened. Local People's Governments have immediately led the farmers to seize the moisture or borrow moisture to rush planting. In areas with little or no rainfall, the People's Governments are continuing to lead farmers in developing water sources and combating drought to plant wheat. Currently, the province has completed more than 60 percent of wheat planting. Puyang and Anyang Special Districts have basically completed the wheat planting task.

    河南大部地区喜雨农民积极种麦
    河南省大部地区在十月五日到二十七日的期间连下了三场雨。全省有二十多个县已经透墒或接墒，各地人民政府都立即领导农民趁墒或借墒抢种。在没有下雨或下雨较少的地区，人民政府正继续领导农民开发水源，抗旱种麦。目前，全省小麦播种已完成百分之六十多。濮阳、安阳两个专区已基本完成种麦任务。
