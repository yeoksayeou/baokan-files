Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 30th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, October 27th: The government of the People's Republic of Poland sent a note to the U.S. government on October 12th, protesting the illegal act of the U.S. sheltering and assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in intercepting the Polish merchant ship "Praca" east of Taiwan on October 4th. Subsequently, the U.S. government submitted a reply to the Polish government on the 20th, flatly denying the U.S. government's association with this illegal act. Therefore, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs again sent a note to the U.S. Embassy in Poland on the 26th.

    The Polish note emphasized that the U.S. government cannot deny that it exercises de facto and comprehensive political, military, and economic control over the Kuomintang bandit gang that occupies Taiwan Island—a part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. It is precisely with U.S. military assistance and the protection of U.S. armed forces that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is able to engage in piracy on the sea near Taiwan Island. The U.S. government also cannot deny that a U.S. armed forces aircraft directly participated in the interception of the Polish merchant ship "Praca".

    In the note, the Polish government once again lodged the strongest protest, reiterated its demand for the release of the Polish merchant ship, its crew, and cargo, and reaffirmed its right to demand compensation for losses.

    波兰再次抗议美国帮助蒋匪截扣波兰商船
    【新华社三十日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙二十七日讯：波兰人民共和国政府曾在十月十二日照会美国政府，抗议美国庇护并帮助蒋介石匪帮于十月四日在台湾以东截扣波兰商船“布拉卡”号的非法行为。接着，美国政府在二十日向波兰政府提出复照，矢口否认美国政府和这种非法行为的关联。为此，波兰外交部部长又于二十六日再次以照会一件送交美国驻波兰大使馆。
    波兰照会强调指出，美国政府不能否认，它对窃据台湾岛——中华人民共和国领土的一部分——的国民党匪帮实行着事实上的、全盘的政治、军事和经济控制。而蒋介石匪帮正是在美国的军事援助和美国武装部队的保护下，才能够在台湾岛附近的海上从事海盗活动。美国政府也不能否认，美国武装部队的一架飞机直接参加了对波兰商船“布拉卡”号的截击。
    波兰政府在照会中再次提出最强硬的抗议，再次要求释放波兰商船以及船员和货物，并重申保留要求赔偿损失的权利。
