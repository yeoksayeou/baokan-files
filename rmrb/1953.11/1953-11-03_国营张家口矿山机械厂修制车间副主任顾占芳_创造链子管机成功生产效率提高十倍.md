    Successfully Creates a Chain Pipe Machine, Increasing Production Efficiency Tenfold
    Gu Zhanfang, Deputy Director of the Repair Workshop of the State-Owned Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory, successfully created a chain pipe machine. The first machine was officially put into production in early September. Preliminary use shows that it has increased production efficiency by about tenfold and reduced raw material consumption, saving more than 3.7 billion yuan annually.
    From January to May of this year, the factory had consistently failed to meet the state plan, mainly due to the unreasonable production of chain pipes. The chain pipe is an important component of the coal conveyor. The original method of making chain pipes was to cut round iron of one inch or one and two inches into one-meter lengths, and then carry out drilling, cutting, peeling, and so on, requiring six processes. After the pipe was made, two-thirds of the round iron would become waste. This method not only wasted materials but also often affected the completion of production tasks due to disconnections in production, and even caused many unnecessary losses. Therefore, the production of chain pipes became a key issue in production. The leadership called on employees to use their brains to solve this key problem. At this time, Gu Zhanfang, deputy director of the repair workshop, saw this situation and decided to make a machine for producing chain pipes. He found some parts from the scrap iron pile and used several evenings after work to try to make a machine prototype. With the strong support of the leadership and the help of all the factory employees, after more than two months of painstaking research and dozens of improvements, such as the core of the pipe roller was originally fixed and the pipe could not come out automatically, so he changed it to a moving core; because the core was prone to heat and expansion, he found a small water pump from a car to circulate cold water back and forth in the core. In this way, the pipe could come down smoothly. The chain pipe machine was finally successfully created. The workers were unspeakably happy to see this simple, lightweight machine that could produce chain pipes in large quantities. Some said, "Gu Zhanfang has solved a key problem for the factory. This spirit of active creation is worth learning from." Now, the first chain pipe machine has been officially put into production, and the production efficiency is about ten times higher than in the past. Furthermore, waste iron plates are used instead of round iron, reducing raw material consumption and saving more than 3.7 billion yuan annually. The second chain pipe machine will also be made in mid-October. Originally, this factory needed more than a dozen lathes to make pipes, but in the future, these two chain pipe machines will be able to fully undertake the factory's task of producing chain pipes.

    创造链子管机成功生产效率提高十倍
    国营张家口矿山机械制造厂修制车间副主任顾占芳，创造链子管机成功。第一部机器已在九月初正式投入生产，初步使用的结果，提高了生产效率十倍左右，并且降低了原材料消耗全年可节约三十七亿多元。
    该厂今年一至五月份，一直没有完成国家计划，主要原因是链子管的生产不合理。链子管是运煤机上的一种重要机件。原来做链子管的方法是：把一吋或一吋二的圆铁，截成一公尺长，然后进行打眼、切断、剥外皮等等，需要六道工序，做成管子后，有三分之二的圆铁就要变成废料。这样作既浪费材料，又常常因生产中的不衔接情况影响生产任务的完成，甚至造成许多不应有的损失。因此，链子管的生产就成了生产上的关键问题。领导上为此就号召职工开动脑筋来解决这一个关键问题。这时修制车间副主任顾占芳，看到这种情况，决心做出一个生产链子管的机器来。他从乱铁堆里找了些零件，下班后，利用几个晚上的时间试做了一个机器样子。在领导方面的大力支持与全厂职工的帮助下，经过两个多月的苦心钻研，先后改进了几十次，如卷管的芯子原来是死的，卷管不能自动出来，后来把它改成活的；因芯子容易发热发胀，他就找了一个汽车上的小水泵，使冷水在芯子里来回循环。这样，管子就可以顺利地下来。链子管机终于创造成功了。工人们看到这一部简单、轻便又能大量生产链子管的机器，都有说不出来的高兴。有的说：“顾占芳为厂里解决了关键问题，这种积极创造的精神值得我们学习。”现在，第一部链子管机已经正式投入生产，生产效率比过去提高十倍左右，并且利用废铁板代替圆铁，降低原材料消耗，全年可节约三十七亿余元。第二部链子管机也将在十月中旬做成。原来这厂做管子需要十几部镟床，将来这两部链子管机就可以全部担负起该厂生产链子管的任务了。
