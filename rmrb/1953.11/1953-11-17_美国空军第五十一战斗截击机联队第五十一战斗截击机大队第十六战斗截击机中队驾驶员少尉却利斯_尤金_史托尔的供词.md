    Testimony of Second Lieutenant Cerils Eugene Stoll, Pilot of the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Group, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, U.S. Air Force
    I Participated in the Bacteriological Warfare Conducted by the U.S. Air Force
    I am Cerils Eugene Stoll, born September 28, 1928, U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant. My home is on a small farm in Ohio, on the north end of Main Street in Paulding.
    I entered the Aviation Academy at Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, on August 15, 1949, and graduated as a Second Lieutenant on October 28, 1950, at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona. After graduation, I was assigned to the 62nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 142nd Fighter-Interceptor Wing at O'Hare Air Force Base, where I flew F-86 aircraft. I stayed at this base until October 28, 1951, when I was sent overseas to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in Korea. I arrived at the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing's base in Suwon on November 20, 1951. On January 7, 1952, I was shot down by a MiG aircraft near Sunchon in North Korea.
    Between December 24, 1951, and January 7, 1952, I flew a total of six combat missions in Korea, one of which was part of the initial test of bacteriological warfare. I will describe this mission and the briefing related to it below. This is part of the U.S. Air Force's insane bacteriological warfare in Korea in which I participated.
    Around December 27, 1951, I and nineteen others attended a mission briefing for the mission that was to be flown that day. After the group briefing, the flight leader told us during the squadron briefing that this was a special mission in which we were to carry "experimental tanks." Then, he emphasized the issue of fuel consumption because we would not have extra fuel in the tanks. He also briefed us that we could only drop the tanks according to his orders.
    The route we were to fly that day was from Suwon, out to sea, then north past Sinanju, turning inland along the Chongchon River, and returning along the original route. Apparently, the flight leader knew in advance that we were to drop our "experimental tanks" in the Kunu-ri supply area near Sinanju.
    Although this was a special mission, I didn't think much of it, considering it just a test of our tanks. Our general habit was to thoroughly inspect the aircraft before starting the engines, but I was late that afternoon, so I only ran around the aircraft and checked it roughly. When I climbed into the cockpit, I asked the maintenance chief if everything was alright. He replied that it was, so I signed the form taking responsibility for the aircraft.
    We took off at 13:00 and flew along the route described in the briefing. As we had just flown over the coast and arrived over Sinanju, some MiG aircraft were spotted, and the flight leader told us to drop all the tanks (two tanks per aircraft). All these tanks were dropped near Sinanju, and the flight leader then fired at the MiGs once and left. After that, no more MiG aircraft were spotted, so we returned to base, landing with fifty gallons of fuel remaining.
    Before dinner, as I was walking to the mess hall after finishing a beer at the club, I overheard Colonel Mahurin talking to some people about carrying insects in the tanks that afternoon, but I didn't think about it at the time. When I saw my squadron commander, Major Coons, I asked him why we had carried "experimental tanks" that afternoon. He replied that it was only to test our tanks.
    Around Christmas or before Christmas, some officers of the rank of Major to Colonel came to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The quiet arrival of these personnel was strange, and no one seemed to know why they were here. At that time of Christmas, we had not yet carried out the "experimental tank" mission, so the reaction to the arrival of these personnel was merely resentment because if they were going to fly, some Lieutenants on the list would have to be pushed down, which would extend the time it took us to complete one hundred missions. These personnel were not assigned work in the Wing, and I later discovered that at least one or perhaps all of them were related to bacteriological warfare. Among these personnel, I only know the names of two people, Major Schaffer and Colonel Mahurin, who flew from the United States to Korea via Japan.
    On January 2, 1952, Colonel Gabreski, then the commander of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Suwon, gave a lecture on military discipline to all personnel of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The lecture was given in the morning, and its purpose was to stop the talk about carrying bacteria in experimental tanks. After this lecture, Wing Adjutant Captain Cook read out Article 104 of the Articles of War.
    Colonel Gabreski stated in his speech that orders must be strictly followed, even if you may not understand them or even disagree with them, because these orders are issued by people who understand the issues better than you.
    This idea implies military discipline, but I think it is this idea that makes you blindly obey any order without considering its consequences.
    Then, on January 3, 1952, just after lunch, Colonel Mahurin gave a speech to all sixty to seventy pilots of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in the group briefing room, lasting about forty to fifty minutes.
    Like everyone else, I arrived at the briefing room about five minutes early. I entered the briefing room and sat down to wait for the lecture to begin. At 13:00, we all stood up, and Colonel Mahurin introduced himself, saying, "I am Colonel Mahurin, one of the new personnel who arrived around Christmas, and I will stay here for a few months to gain some combat experience to take back with me." This was his self-introduction at both lectures on January 3 and 4, 1952.
    His speech was characterized by the phrase "drastic measures." The entire speech was to justify the use or adoption of these "drastic measures." In the speech, Colonel Mahurin spent thirty minutes, or even a little more, making these explanations. He said, "Since the thirty days of intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire have passed without result, the war will continue indefinitely unless we take some 'drastic measures' to end the war." He said, "Drastic measures" "will stop the spring offensive that the Chinese and Korean sides are organizing." Then he said, "The 'drastic measures' I am talking about are to conduct bacteriological warfare." "Experiments of this nature have been carried out by the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing around December 27, 1951. The bacteriological tanks were reportedly dropped in the Kunu-ri supply area near Sinanju on the Chongchon River to disrupt the enemy's supply depots."
    When he said this, the briefing room was painfully silent, and although it was not outwardly expressed, everyone looked at each other with an expression of "What is going to happen now?" Even after the lecture, no one talked to me about this matter, but I felt that everyone deliberately avoided mentioning this issue in all conversations.
    After saying this, he continued to explain that these experiments that had been carried out were to stop the accumulation of supplies and the concentration of troops. This is what he mentioned above as the so-called organized spring offensive. Then he began to repeat his set of arguments about using "drastic measures." He said that "drastic measures" were necessary to prevent a greater loss of American lives, and he still tried to find a major excuse to justify the use of this scientific monster. Colonel Mahurin seemed to be trying to convince himself of his own arguments as he spoke. Before the end of the lecture, he said to us, "Leave what you see, hear, or talk about here!"
    On January 4, 1952, pilots and ground crew of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing were summoned to the base theater. There, a Major (whose name I do not know) lectured us on the construction and use of bacteriological tanks. Colonel Mahurin also repeated his "drastic measures" speech. He told us that other Wings in Korea were also conducting bacteriological warfare, and that the bacteria we were carrying included: typhus, typhoid, cholera, and plague.
    This lecture was conducted in the morning, and about sixty to seventy pilots and about one hundred and thirty ground crew members participated in this lecture.
    Colonel Mahurin was a tall and slender man, about thirty years old, and a very young Colonel. The first time I saw him was at Christmas. At that time, I asked my friends who this new Colonel was. They told me it was Colonel Mahurin and described the arrival of the new personnel that I had mentioned earlier.
    Colonel Mahurin's voice was loud and very boastful. When I saw him at Christmas, he said, "You guys don't even know how to fly this plane, just wait and see me start flying combat missions." This sentence made several of my Lieutenant friends feel very uncomfortable.
    This is the part of the inhuman and insane bacteriological warfare conducted by the U.S. Air Force in which I participated. My guilt is extreme, and in confessing, my only hope is to be allowed to reform myself and live a life for the people instead of against them. In this reformation, as an American citizen, I feel obliged to prove to the American people that the U.S. military is conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. I implore the American people to judge this scientific scum as illegal.

    美国空军第五十一战斗截击机联队第五十一战斗截击机大队第十六战斗截击机中队驾驶员少尉却利斯·尤金·史托尔的供词
    我参加了美国空军所进行的细菌战
    我是却利斯·尤金·史托尔，生于一九二八年九月二十八日，美国空军少尉。我的家住在俄亥俄州一个小农庄，鲍尔丁城的大街北端。
    我于一九四九年八月十五日进入得克萨斯州培林空军基地的航空军校，而于一九五○年十月二十八日在亚利桑那州的威廉姆斯空军基地作为一个少尉毕业了。毕业以后，我被指派到奥哈尔空军基地的第一百四十二战斗截击机联队第六十二战斗截击机中队，我在那里驾驶F—86型飞机。我在这个基地一直呆到一九五一年十月二十八日才被派遣出国，到朝鲜的第五十一战斗截击机联队。我于一九五一年十一月二十日到达第五十一战斗截击机联队的驻地水原。一九五二年一月七日在北朝鲜顺川被米格机击落。
    自一九五一年十二月二十四日到一九五二年一月七日之间，我在朝鲜共飞行六次战斗任务，其中有一次是细菌战最初试验的一部分。下面我要描述这次任务和有关这次任务的讲课。这就是美国空军在朝鲜疯狂进行细菌战中我所参加的一部分。
    一九五一年十二月二十七日左右，我与其他十九个人参加了将要在那一天飞行的任务简令。大队简令后，小队长在小队简令时，告诉我们这是一次特殊任务，在这次任务中我们要带“试验油箱”。然后，他着重提出燃料的消耗量问题，因为我们在油箱里将没有额外的燃料。他还简令我们，只有根据他的命令才可投掷油箱。
    我们那天要飞行的航线是从水原出发，出海然后北经新安州，转入海岸线内沿清川江而上，归航就按原航线折回。显然，小队长早晓得我们要在新安州附近的军隅里供给区投掷我们的“试验油箱”。
    虽然这是一个特殊任务，但我毫不在意，认为只是对我们的油箱作一次试验。我们一般的习惯是在发动引擎前彻底检查一下飞机，可是这天下午我迟到了，所以只跑到飞机四周大略地检查了一下。当我爬进驾驶座舱时，我问机务长是否一切都妥当了。他回答说是的，因而我就在负责接手这架飞机的表格上签了字。
    我们于十三时起飞，沿简令中所述的航线飞行。当我们刚飞过海岸到达新安州上空时，有人发现了米格飞机，小队长告诉我们丢掉所有的油箱
  （每架飞机两个）。所有这些油箱都投在新安州附近，小队长接着向米格射击了一次就走开，以后就未再发现米格飞机，这样我们就回到基地，着陆时还剩有五十加仑燃料。
    晚饭之前，当我在俱乐部喝完啤酒正走去站队吃晚餐时，我听见马胡林上校对一些人谈到那天下午在油箱中携带昆虫的事，但当时我还没有去想它。当我看见我的中队长孔斯少校时，我问他为什么我们在那天下午带了“试验油箱”。他回答说，这仅是为了试验我们的油箱。
    在圣诞节或圣诞节前，第五十一战斗截击机联队里来了一些少校至上校级的军官。这些人员的悄悄驾临是奇怪的，而似乎没有人清楚他们为什么到这里来。在圣诞节的那个时候，我们还没有执行过 “试验油箱”任务，因此对来到的这些人员的反应仅仅是一种愤慨，因为假如他们要飞行，那么名单上有些尉官得挤下来，这样就会延长我们完成一百次任务的时间了。这些人员在联队里没有派定工作，后来我发现至少有一个或者恐怕全部都与细菌战有关。在这些人员中，我只知道两个人的名字，即谢菲尔少校及马胡林上校，这些人是从美国取道日本飞来朝鲜的。
      一九五二年一月二日，那时在水原的第五十一战斗截击机联队的联队长加布里斯基上校，向第五十一战斗截击机联队全体人员上了一堂关于军事纪律的课。这课是在早晨上的，其目的是在制止关于在试验油箱中携带细菌的谈论。这课以后，联队副官库克上尉宣读了战争条例第一百零四款。
    加布里斯基上校在谈话中说明了必须严格执行命令，即使你也许不明白这些命令甚或不同意这些命令，因为这些命令是由比你了解问题更深的人发布的。
    这种想法就意味着军事纪律，但是我认为就是这种想法才使你盲目地服从任何命令，而对其后果不加任何考虑。
    接着在一九五二年一月三日刚吃过午饭后，马胡林上校在大队简令室，对第五十一战斗截击机联队全部驾驶员六十至七十人作了一次演讲，时间约有四十分钟到五十分钟。
    我像所有其他人一样早到简令室约五分钟，我进入简令室坐下来等候上课开始。十三时，我们全体起立，马胡林上校自我介绍说：“我是马胡林上校，是在圣诞节前后来到的新人员之一，我将在这里呆几个月，取得一些战斗经验带回去。”这就是他在一九五二年一月三日与四日两次讲课上的自我介绍。
    他的演讲以用“剧烈措施”一语为特色。全篇讲话都是为使用或采取这些“剧烈措施”作辩解。在演说中，马胡林上校用了三十分钟，甚至还要多一些，来作这些解释。他说：“由于为实现停火而加紧努力的三十天已经没有结果地过去了，战争将无限期地继续下去，除非我们采取某种‘剧烈措施’来终止战争。”他说：“剧烈措施”，“将制止中朝方面正在组织中的春季攻势。”然后他说：“我所谈到的‘剧烈措施’就是进行细菌战。”“这种性质的试验已由第五十一战斗截击机联队于一九五一年十二月二十七日左右执行过了。那次试验细菌油箱据说是投在清川江上的新安州附近的军隅里供给区，以破坏敌方的补给站的。”
    他讲这段话的时候，简令室沉静得使人难受，虽然外表上没有流露出来，但每个人都以“现在将会发生些什么呢？”的表情面面相觑。即使下课后，没有人和我谈到这个事情，但我觉得大家在所有的谈话中都故意避免提到这个问题。
    讲过这段话以后，他继续解释已经执行过的这些实验是为了制止供应的集结及部队的集中。这就是他上面所提到的所谓组织春季攻势。然后他又开始重复他关于使用“剧烈措施”这一套议论。他说：“剧烈措施”对于制止更大量的美国生命损失是必要的，他仍然企图寻个重大藉口为这种科学魔怪的使用作辩解。马胡林上校似乎是设法使他自己相信自己的论调而说着话。在散课前，他对我们说：“把你们在这里所看到的、听到的或谈到的东西，都留在这里吧！”
    一九五二年一月四日，第五十一战斗截击机联队驾驶员和地勤人员都被召集到基地戏院去。在那里，一个少校（他的名字我不知道）向我们讲了关于细菌油箱的构造及使用法。马胡林上校也重复了他的“剧烈措施”的讲话。他告诉我们说，在朝鲜的其他联队也正在进行细菌战，我们所携带的细菌中有：斑疹伤寒、伤寒、霍乱和鼠疫。
    这讲课是在早晨进行的，约有六十到七十个驾驶员和约一百三十个地勤人员参加了这次讲课。
    马胡林上校是个高而瘦长的个子，年约三十，是个很年青的上校。我第一次看见他是在圣诞节。当时我问我的朋友，这个新上校是谁。他们告诉我说是马胡林上校，并叙述了我在前面已提过的新人物的到来。
    马胡林上校的声音粗大，并很自夸。当我在圣诞节看见他时，他说：“你们这班人根本就不知道怎样驾驶这种飞机，等着瞧我开始飞行作战吧。”这句话使我几个尉官朋友都感到很不舒服。
    这就是我参加美国空军所进行的非人道的疯狂细菌战的一分。我罪大已极，在认罪时，我唯一的希望是允许我悔过自新，过一种为人民而不是反人民的生活。在这种悔过自新当中，作为一个美国公民，我觉得有责任向美国人民证明美军在朝鲜正在进行细菌战。我恳求美国人民判定这种科学败类为非法。
