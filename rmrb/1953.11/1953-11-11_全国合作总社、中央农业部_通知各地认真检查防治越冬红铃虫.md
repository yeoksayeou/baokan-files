    All-China Federation of Cooperatives, Central Ministry of Agriculture
    Notice to All Localities to Conscientiously Inspect and Prevent Overwintering Pink Bollworm
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued a notice requiring all localities to conscientiously inspect and prevent overwintering pink bollworm.
    The notice said: This year, pink bollworm has occurred widely in cotton, causing a large number of flower shedding, bud shedding, boll shedding, as well as stiff petals and rotten bolls. According to inspection, more than 80% of this insect enters cotton gins, flower collection stations, and farmers' flower storage rooms with seed cotton to overwinter, 10% remain in the cotton seeds, and the rest remain in the cotton stalks and dry bolls. Therefore, combining flower drying with the elimination of overwintering pink bollworm in cotton gins and flower collection stations, as well as in farmers’ homes, is the most effective way to reduce the harm of pink bollworm next year. Cotton-producing provinces and regions that have already arranged this work should organize forces at all levels above the county level in the agricultural and cooperative departments to conduct thorough inspections and continue to implement it. Cotton-growing provinces and regions that have not arranged this work should immediately notify relevant factories, stations, farms, etc. to regularly sweep and kill the insects manually or use chemical agents to control them conscientiously.
    Methods for eliminating overwintering pink bollworm: Cotton gins and flower collection stations can spray cotton warehouses, ginning workshops, and cotton cleaning machines with a 10-fold solution of 50% wettable DDT one week before collecting flowers, and then spray again after one month. The removed flower debris should be deeply buried in the soil. Better warehouses can spray a five-foot-wide strip of insecticide under the ceiling, and the walls of warehouses made of reed mats should be sprayed entirely. If there is a large accumulation of seed cotton indoors, it should also be sprayed comprehensively. In areas where the supply of pesticides is inconvenient, the larvae can be swept away every few days, buried in the soil, or burned to death. Farmers can use curtain frames or mat frames to dry flowers, so that the insects fall to the ground and are eaten by chickens. At night, cover the flower piles with cloth sheets, mats, sacks, etc., and the insects attached to them can be collected and killed the next morning. In addition, all dry bolls left on the cotton plants should be picked off before winter and burned before May of next year. Cotton seeds left for fertilizer should also be well composted before May. Cotton seeds should be combined with seed selection to remove insect-infested seeds and use seed soaking to kill insects and prevent diseases. In addition to adopting the farmers' control methods, farms should also treat cotton warehouses in the same way as cotton gins. In addition to treating oil mills in the same way as cotton gins, accumulated cotton seeds should also be pressed out before May of next year to eliminate the larvae inside the seeds.

    全国合作总社、中央农业部
    通知各地认真检查防治越冬红铃虫
    中华全国合作社联合总社、中央人民政府农业部发出联合通知，要求各地认真检查防治越冬红铃虫。
    通知说：今年棉花红铃虫普遍发生，造成大批落花、落蕾、落铃及僵瓣、烂铃等现象。据检查此虫有百分之八十以上随籽花进入轧花厂、收花站及农家堆花室内越冬，百分之十留在棉籽内，其余留在棉秸枯铃内。因此，在轧花厂、收花站结合农家晒花以除治越冬红铃虫，是减轻明年红铃虫为害的最有效办法。凡已经布置此项工作的产棉省区，在县以上各级农业、合作部门，要组织力量，深入检查，继续贯彻执行。未布置此项工作的植棉省区，应即通知有关厂、站、农场等经常用人工扫集杀死或用药剂除治的办法，认真进行防治。
    消灭越冬红铃虫的办法：轧花厂、收花站在收花前一星期可用百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕十倍液喷布棉仓、轧花车间及清花机，一月后再喷一次，清除的花楂要深埋土中。较好的仓库可在天花板下喷五尺宽的药带，用芦席等物做的仓库墙壁全部要喷，如室内籽花堆积甚多也要全面喷药。在药剂供应不便地区，可每隔数日扫除幼虫一次，将其土埋或烧死。农家防治可用帘架或箔架晒花办法，使虫子落地放鸡吃，晚间在花堆上盖布单、席子、麻袋等，次日早晨便可集杀附在上面的虫子。此外，遗在棉株上的枯铃应于冬季以前全部摘下，在明年五月以前烧完。留作肥料的棉籽也要在五月前沤好。棉种应结合选种挑除虫籽，并用浸种办法灭虫防病。农场除采用农家除治办法外，也要用轧花厂的办法处理棉仓。榨油厂除照轧花厂办法处理外，积存的棉籽也要在明年五月以前榨完，以消灭籽内幼虫。
