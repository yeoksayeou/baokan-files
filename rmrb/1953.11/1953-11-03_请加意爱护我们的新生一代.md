    Please Take Extra Care of Our New Generation
    Guo Moruo

    Children and young people are the new generation of the motherland, the most precious treasures of the motherland, and can even be said to be the continuation of the motherland's life.

    Today's children and young people will be the backbone of national construction in ten or twenty years. Since we love our motherland, we cannot but love our children and young people. We must protect them well, nurture them, and make them useful talents for building the motherland.

    Children and young people are highly malleable. Before they gradually grow up and develop into specialized talents, the foundation of general conduct must be firmly laid. Some of their self-awareness has not yet sprouted, and some are still in the budding stage. We must rely on the assistance of objective forces to guide them and properly enlighten their self-awareness. This is a very complicated and meticulous task. Cadres engaged in this work need to have a high degree of patience and a spirit of self-sacrifice. The state should pay special attention to cultivating such cadres. Society should give special respect to such cadres. Although their work has not yet attracted enough attention and does not appear to be particularly spectacular on the surface, they are in fact laying a solid foundation for the cause of national construction.

    However, the work of cultivating children and young people is not solely the responsibility of organizations that focus on children and young people (such as nurseries, kindergartens, schools, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers); it is in fact the responsibility of the entire society. Every family and every individual has a responsibility. Children and young people are in the period of greatest learning ability. They are learning, consciously or unconsciously, from all the environments and people they come into contact with. A good environment will produce good children and young people. If children and young people have bad habits, they are learned from adults. Therefore, every young person or adult should have a sense of responsibility to be a role model for children and young people.

    What kind of people should we cultivate children and young people into? We must enable children and young people to have good physical and mental development, to develop in an all-round way, and to become healthy, lively, brave, quick-witted, calm, friendly, honest, modest, and have a certain degree of self-awareness and creativity.

    To be more specific, I think physical health is the first thing to pay attention to. Children and young people are in the stage of development and should get appropriate exercise, appropriate rest, appropriate games, and appropriate nutrition. Through various reasonable measures, we must enable their bodies to develop normally and enable them to develop a character that loves collective labor from long-term habits.

    Moral education and intellectual education are naturally very important. The cultivation of the "Five Loves" public morality and the imparting of basic knowledge are the main items of education and learning. However, there is another equally important item—aesthetic education—that has not been fully noticed by the general public. We should focus on cultivating children and young people's love of beauty. Literature and art are very good educational tools. Cultivating children and young people through excellent literary and artistic works can assist in the implementation of moral, intellectual, physical, and even technical education, not to mention laying the foundation for the future creation of writers and artists. We are gradually building our motherland into a communist society, which is the most ideal and great work of art. Therefore, our future generations of national builders, whether in transforming society or transforming nature, should be excellent and broad-minded artists. We must understand that politics and production are very high-level arts. Even when building a machine, don’t we all demand that its form be beautiful?

    Therefore, I especially hope that our Chinese writers and artists will create more excellent works for children and young people. Literature and art aimed at children is a vast field worthy of ambitious writers and artists to vigorously explore. People engaged in child support work should, in certain situations, appropriately organize children and young people to meet directly with excellent writers and artists. This is beneficial to both parties. Of course, it is also of great educational significance to be able to meet directly with other outstanding workers, scientists, technicians, labor models, and people's heroes.

    Any work requires the relevant parties to cooperate with each other in order to be done well. For the work of cultivating children and young people, it is even more hoped that the entire society and every family and every individual can cooperate with schools and the Young Pioneers.

    Children and young people born in the Mao Zedong era are happy. Society, families, and individuals have undergone considerable transformation. However, we have only been building our country for four years, and many old habits and old shortcomings cannot be completely eradicated in a short time. Many things that should be done cannot be fully implemented all at once. But we believe that all work will be done gradually. Many teachers, instructors, and many parents and elder brothers in families should understand this and not be too impatient. It is not good to demand too much from the working environment and conditions, or to put strong mental pressure on one's children in order to achieve quick success. Naturally, work should be carried out actively. If there are conditions, they should be implemented as soon as possible; if there are no conditions, preparations should be made as soon as possible. Impatient emotions should be opposed, and conservatism and inaction should also be opposed. But initiative is not impatience; we should not confuse the two.

    I urge educators, literary and art workers, scientific workers, social activists, parents, and all adult and young comrades in China to take extra care of our new generation!

    请加意爱护我们的新生一代
    郭沫若
    少年儿童是祖国新生的一代，是祖国最值得珍重的宝贝，更可以说是祖国生命的延续。
    今天的少年儿童，再过十年二十年之后，就是国家建设的骨干。我们既热爱我们的祖国，就不能不热爱我们的少年儿童。我们要好好地保护他们，培养他们，使他们成为有用的建设祖国的人才。
    少年儿童的可塑性很大，在他们逐渐长成，逐渐发展为专门人才之前，一般做人的基础一定要坚实地打好。他们的自觉性，有的还未萌芽，有的还在萌芽状态，一定要靠客观力量的辅助来引导他们，好好地启发他们的自觉性。这是很繁杂、很细致的工作，从事这项工作的干部需要有高度的耐心和自我牺牲的精神。国家对于这样的干部是应该加意培植的。社会对于这样的干部是应该特别尊重的。虽然他们的工作目前还没有引起足够的注意，表面上看来并不轰轰烈烈，但事实上他们是在切切实实地为国家建设事业奠定基础。
    但培养少年儿童的工作，并不单是以少年儿童为对象的组织机构（如托儿所、幼儿园、学校、青年团、少年先锋队等）的责任，事实上是整个社会的责任。每一个家庭，每一个个人，都是有责任的。少年儿童正处在学习性最强的时期，凡是和他们接触的环境和人物，他们在经意与不经意之间都在进行学习。有好的环境便会有好的少年儿童。少年儿童们假如有不好的习惯，都是从大人们学来的。所以每一个青年人或成年人应该有成为少年儿童的榜样的责任感。
    我们要把少年儿童培养成怎样的人呢？我们要使得少年儿童能够得到身体上与精神上的良好的发育，要使他们能够全面发展，要使他们成为健康、活泼、勇敢、机敏、沉着、友爱、诚实、谦和、有一定的自觉性与创造性的人。
    如果说得更具体一些，我认为身体的健康是首先值得注意的。少年儿童们是正在发育的时期，应该得到适当的锻炼、适当的休息、适当的游戏、适当的营养。通过各种合理的措施，要使他们的身体获得正常的发育，并使他们从长期的习惯中养成爱好集体劳动的性格。
    德育、智育，自然是非常重要的。“五爱”公德的培养，基本知识的授予，这是教育与学习的主要项目。但是，还有一个同样重要的项目——美育，却没有充分地为一般人所注意。我们应该着重培养少年儿童们的爱美的情操。文学艺术是很好的教育工具，通过优秀的文学艺术作品来培养少年儿童，可以辅助德育、智育、体育、乃至技术教育的进行，不用说更可以替未来的文学家、艺术家的造就工作奠定基础。我们是要把我们的祖国逐步建设成为共产主义社会，这就是最理想的伟大的艺术品。因而我们今后代代的国家建设者们，无论在改造社会方面的或改造自然方面的，都应该是优秀的广义的艺术家。我们要了解政治和生产都是很高度的艺术，即使造一部机器吧，我们不是都要求其形式美化吗？
    因此，我特别希望我们中国的文学艺术家们多多为少年儿童们产生些优秀的作品。以儿童为对象的文学和艺术是很值得有志气的文学艺术家们锐意开拓的一个广阔的天地。从事儿童辅育工作的人，最好能在一定的场合中，适当地组织少年儿童们和优秀的文学艺术家们直接见面。这对双方都是有好处的。当然和其他方面的优秀工作者、科学家、技术家、劳动模范、人民英雄，能够多多地直接见面，同样是有很大的教育意义的。
    任何工作，都需要有关方面能够互相配合，才能够做好。对于少年儿童的培养工作，更希望整个社会和每一个家庭、每一个个人，都能够和学校、和少年先锋队相互配合。
    生在毛泽东时代的少年儿童们是幸福的。社会、家庭和个人都经过了相当的改造。但是我们建国才仅仅四年，许多旧的习惯、旧的缺点，一时还不能完全改掉。许多应该做的事情，一时也还不能够全盘举办起来。但是我们相信，一切工作是会逐步做好的。许多教师、辅导员，许多家庭的父母兄长，应该要了解这一点，不要太急躁。如果对于工作环境和条件要求过高，或对于自己的子弟急于求成而加以精神上的强力压迫，那都是很不好的。自然，工作是应该积极进行的。有条件的就要赶快办起来，没有条件的就要赶快准备条件。急躁情绪自应反对，保守不进也应当反对。但积极性并不是急躁，我们不要混同。
    我吁请教育工作者们、文艺工作者们、科学工作者们、社会活动家们、家长们，全中国的一切成年同志们和青年同志们，加意爱护我们的新生一代吧！
