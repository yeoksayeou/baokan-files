I Want to Sell Grain to the State
As told by Liu Hengchang, recorded by Gao Jin, Geng Jin, and Ru Sheng.

    My name is Liu Hengchang, and I am sixty-five years old this year. My hometown is in Nanhe County, Hebei Province. Before liberation, my family was so poor that we didn't even have rice to cook. That year, my hometown suffered a famine, and the black-hearted landlords still demanded rent grain. After much deliberation, with no other choice, my family of four fled the famine. In the old society, we were always hungry, eating chaff and wild herbs, barely surviving until the arrival of our savior, the Communist Party. Since then, I settled down in Gedatan Village, Fourth District, Yushe, Shanxi. During the land reform, I was allocated land and a house, and now my life is much better.

    This summer, when the state was purchasing wheat, the director of our village's supply and marketing cooperative, Zhao Tuhai, said to me: "Our country has started planned economic construction this year, building factories and opening mines. The number of workers and the urban population has increased, and the country needs sufficient grain. We must sell more grain to support industrial construction!" At the time, I didn't fully understand supporting industrial construction, but I always knew in my heart that the happy life we have is brought to us by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The country's industrial construction is Chairman Mao leading us to live better lives. Since we have wheat and the country needs it, we should sell it to the state. So, I sold 1,100 jin of wheat to the state at that time.

    Recently, the government called for a campaign to increase production and practice thrift. My second son, Xiusheng, came home from the county government and explained the reasons for launching the campaign to increase production and practice thrift to support national construction. Now I finally understand.

    My family has a little over seventeen mu of land, and the yield increases year by year. This year, we harvested seventeen shi of millet alone. My family grows three mu of wheat. In 1952, we harvested three shi of wheat. When I planted wheat last autumn, I treated the seeds with pesticides and bought twenty jin of fertilizer and applied topdressing. This year's wheat is really good. The three mu yielded more than five shi. Without the fertilizer and pesticides produced by our worker elder brothers, we could not have hoped for such a bumper harvest. Moreover, the cloth we wear, the kerosene and matches we use every day, none of that can be separated from the hands of our worker elder brothers. Also, the price of industrial products is getting cheaper year by year, and the price of grain is getting higher year by year. One dou of wheat can be exchanged for more than six chi of white shirting. I have lived for over sixty years, and this is the first time I have seen this. Developing industry will bring such great benefits to us peasants!

    I have thought it over. In addition to the 1,100 jin of wheat I sold to the state this summer, I will sell another eighty jin of wheat to the state. We harvested more autumn grain. We will sell 600 jin of millet, 1,000 jin of black beans, and 1,000 jin of corn to the state to support national construction. With the money from selling the grain, besides buying some daily necessities, I will buy ten piglets and three sheep, and the rest will be saved in the bank to be used entirely for agricultural and sideline production. I can't bear to waste a single bit of it.

    我要把粮食卖给国家
    刘恒昌说，高锦、庚金、如生等记
    我叫刘恒昌，今年六十五岁了。我老家住在河北省南和县。解放前，我家里穷的滚了锅子也没米下。那年老家闹灾荒，黑心的地主们还要催租粮。左思右想没办法，蹬了蹬脚，全家四口人出来逃荒。在旧社会里，饥一顿，饿一顿，吃糠咽菜，好容易熬到了头，来了救星共产党。从此以后，我在山西榆社第四区疙疸滩村安了家，土地改革时，分到了地，分到了房子，如今生活过好了。
    今年夏季国家收购小麦，俺村供销社主任赵秃孩对我说：咱们国家今年开始了有计划的经济建设，修工厂，开矿山，工人和城市人口增加了，国家需要足够的粮食，咱们要多卖粮食支援工业建设啊！当时，我对支援工业建设还不十分了解，可是我心眼里总知道：幸福的生活是毛主席、共产党带给的，国家进行工业建设，是毛主席领导咱过更好的日子啦，咱有小麦，国家需要，就该卖小麦给国家。所以当时我就卖给国家一千一百斤小麦。
    最近政府号召开展增产节约运动，又碰着我二儿子秀生从县政府回家，他把开展增产节约运动支援国家建设的道理和我说了一遍，现在我可算弄清楚了。
    我家一共十七亩多地，产量一年比一年提高，今年光谷子就打了十七石。我家种着三亩小麦，在一九五二年打了三石麦子。我在去年秋季种麦时用药剂拌了种，又买了二十来斤肥田粉，上了追肥。今年的麦子真是好，三亩地就打了五石多。没有工人老大哥造的肥田粉、药剂，我们的丰产是盼不到的。再说，我们穿的布，日用的煤油、火柴，那样也离不开工人老大哥的手。还有，工业品价格一年比一年便宜，粮食价格一年比一年提高，一斗小麦能换六尺多白市布，我活了六十多岁了，这还是初见呢。发展了工业，对咱农民就会有这样大的好处！
    我打算了打算，除了夏季卖给国家的一千一百斤小麦，还要再卖给国家八十斤小麦。秋粮咱收的更多，咱要把六百斤小米、一千斤黑豆、一千斤玉茭卖给国家，支援国家建设。卖了粮食的钱，除了买些日用品，俺要买十口小猪、三只羊，其余先存到银行里，要全部用到农、副业生产上，俺可一点也舍不得浪费掉。
