    We Implemented Centralized Treatment for Chronic Diseases
    Wei Zhengming, President of Beijing Municipal Fifth Hospital; Hu Bichen, Vice President
    Our hospital is a central hospital in Beijing that implements public medical care. The patients who come to our hospital are mostly cadres from various agencies in Beijing, with a small number being employees of municipal enterprises that have medical contracts with us.
    Although the number of outpatients and inpatients in our hospital is not as crowded as in some hospitals, the chaotic situation in the outpatient department is still serious. Generally, new patients have to wait ten days to see a doctor, and follow-up patients have to wait even longer. Because of the chaos in the outpatient department, not only are patients dissatisfied because they cannot see a doctor on time, but also the hospital staff is not in high spirits because they cannot get off work on time every day. In the past, we believed that the chaos in the outpatient department was unavoidable: on the one hand, because there are many agencies and few hospitals in Beijing, the development of health and medical institutions cannot keep up with the needs of the people's lives; on the other hand, the incidence of diseases is generally higher in the summer and autumn seasons. However, facts have proved that this is only part of the objective reason for the chaos in the outpatient department. Because this point was not clarified, we did not seriously consider how to allocate existing medical resources according to the conditions of our hospital and the patients' conditions, and how to improve our working methods and medical system under the existing medical conditions to appropriately solve the outpatient congestion phenomenon, so this problem was not solved in time. Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau put forward the slogan "Facilitate patients, tap potential, and improve work efficiency," calling on municipal hospitals to actively rectify outpatient work and gradually change the outpatient congestion phenomenon, all staff of our hospital began to study the causes of outpatient chaos and actively find ways to change the current chaotic situation in the outpatient department.
    Research results tell us that there are quite a few chronic patients in our hospital. According to incomplete statistics, among internal medicine outpatients, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis account for about 20%, patients with neurasthenia account for about 20%, and patients with chronic heart disease account for about 10%; among surgical outpatients, patients with rheumatoid arthritis account for about 30%. Because patients have been suffering from diseases for a long time, they are in a bad mood, have many doubts, and are most eager to recover as soon as possible; and because they lack basic medical and health knowledge, they always hope that doctors can provide effective treatment in a timely manner during the treatment process, and hope that doctors can patiently answer their questions. However, because there are many patients and the outpatient work has a quota, each doctor must see an average of nine patients per hour, so it is difficult to meet the needs of these patients; at the same time, in the doctor's view, these chronic diseases cannot be cured all at once, so they are unwilling, and in fact, it is impossible to spend a lot of time explaining to patients. As a result, the number of follow-up patients increased day by day, and the outpatient work became even more chaotic.
    The above situation shows that to overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the outpatient work in our hospital, we must first start by solving the problem of chronic patients. In July of this year, our hospital held a meeting of responsible comrades from the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, as well as doctors and nurses from various departments, to discuss how to solve this problem. The meeting initially determined the policy of concentrating patients with the same type of chronic disease for treatment. This policy can not only improve the treatment effect of chronic patients, but also improve our working methods, medical system, and overcome the chaotic phenomenon in outpatient work. And in the current situation, this is the only way to better exert our existing medical resources.
    At the end of July, we began to allocate strong cadres, enrich the medical resources of the outpatient department, and set up chronic disease clinics. At the same time, public health nurses were assigned to promote the advantages of centralized treatment for chronic diseases to patients waiting in the waiting room, and to win the trust and cooperation of patients. On August 3, we began the centralized treatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. On September 14 and 21, we started the centralized treatment of patients with neurasthenia and chronic arthritis, respectively.
    The so-called centralized treatment of chronic diseases is to concentrate chronic patients of the same type and with the same condition for treatment at the same time. Before carrying out centralized treatment, we first conducted a comprehensive examination of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, neurasthenia, and rheumatoid arthritis, and then classified them according to their condition (such as dividing neurasthenia patients into severe, moderate, and mild groups). Newly diagnosed patients were also assigned to participate in a certain group treatment at any time after diagnosis. The treatment methods we adopted are: first, the public health nurses of each clinic conduct waiting room education for patients based on their common characteristics, so that each patient can fully understand the source, symptoms, prognosis, and recuperation methods of their disease; the doctor then conducts special education and necessary explanations for the patient's ideological situation, so that the patient can correctly understand prevention and nursing methods. Because sufficient ideological education was carried out before treatment, doctors can concentrate their efforts on treatment work. The results of the three-month trial of centralized treatment for chronic diseases have proved that in hospitals like ours with a large number of chronic patients, adopting this treatment method can not only enable the hospital to grasp the daily number of follow-up visits and overcome the chaotic phenomenon in outpatient work to the greatest extent; but also, each technical department can prepare for work and improve work efficiency. For example, the X-ray room and the operating room can roughly determine the number of people who need fluoroscopy and surgery on the first day of centralized treatment, the pharmacy can know what kind of drugs a certain group of patients needs, and the doctor can concentrate on studying the problems that may occur in the diagnosis and treatment of the next day. Now, the chaotic phenomenon in our hospital's outpatient department has been initially overcome. In the past, if a doctor in the internal medicine outpatient department wanted to see 36 patients in one morning, they had to extend their working hours by one or two hours. Now, a doctor in the ordinary internal medicine outpatient department can finish seeing 36 patients on time in one morning; and in the internal medicine outpatient department that implements centralized treatment, a doctor can see 40 to 50 patients, and sometimes about 60 patients, in one morning. In the past, it was impossible for the surgical outpatient department to carry out paraffin therapy alone. Now, more than 20 chronic arthritis patients can receive paraffin therapy in one morning. At present, new internal medicine patients can generally receive treatment on the same day, and the appointment time for follow-up patients has also been greatly shortened.
    Due to the implementation of centralized treatment for chronic diseases, doctors have more time to conduct detailed examinations and treatments for patients, and patients feel that doctors are more responsible than in the past. Patient Da Deshan said: "After the implementation of centralized treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, doctors have a comprehensive understanding of each patient, and we also understand our symptoms, so I believe that the doctor's diagnosis and the recuperation methods they said are correct. If this had been done earlier, my illness would have been cured long ago." Patient Hu Ruixiang said: "In the past, doctors were unwilling to spend time explaining the principles of neurasthenia to us, so there was always a knot in my mind. This time, the doctor spent a lot of time explaining the causes and recuperation methods of neurasthenia to the patients, which relieved me of a great ideological burden." Due to the concentration of diseases, doctors can also conduct research on pathology and treatment, and gradually improve the technical level of specialist treatment. Public health nurses and outpatient nurses have also gradually accumulated systematic knowledge of these diseases. After receiving waiting room education, patients have mastered some basic medical and health knowledge, and they can also promote it to other patients in other places.
    However, centralized treatment for chronic diseases is still a new attempt in our hospital. We hope to exchange experiences with other fraternal hospitals in order to continue to improve our work, further improve work efficiency, and better serve the people.

    我们实行了慢性病集中治疗
    北京市立第五医院院长　魏正明  副院长　胡璧臣
    我们医院是北京市施行公费医疗的中心医院。到我们医院看病的，除少数是和我们医院订有医疗合同的市属企业单位的职工外，绝大部分是北京市各机关的干部。
    我们医院的门诊、住院情况虽然不像某些医院那样拥挤，但门诊的忙乱现象仍是严重的。一般初诊病人要等十天才能看上病，复诊病人还要长一些。因为门诊工作的忙乱，不仅病人因不能按时看病，表示不满，就是医院工作人员也因每天不能按时下班，工作情绪不高。过去我们曾经认为，门诊工作的忙乱是不可避免的：一方面因为北京市的机关多，医院少，卫生医疗机构的发展赶不上人民生活的需要；另一方面，在夏秋两季，发病率一般说来是比较高的。但事实证明，这只是造成门诊工作忙乱的一部分客观原因。因为这一点没有弄清楚，所以没有认真考虑怎样根据我们医院的条件和病人的情况来调配现有的医疗力量，在现有的医疗条件下改进我们的工作方法和医疗制度，适当地解决门诊拥挤现象，以致这一问题没有及时解决。自从北京市人民政府公共卫生局提出“便利病人，挖掘潜力，提高工作效率”的口号，号召各市级医院积极整顿门诊工作，逐步改变门诊拥挤现象以后，我院全体工作人员才开始研究门诊忙乱的原因，积极设法来改变目前门诊的忙乱状况。
    研究结果告诉我们，在我们医院里，慢性病人相当多。据不完全统计，在内科门诊病人中，肺结核患者约占百分之二十，神经衰弱患者约占百分之二十，慢性心脏病患者约占百分之十；外科门诊病人中类风湿性关节炎患者约占百分之三十。病人因为长期受到疾病的折磨，情绪很坏，疑虑也多，要求早日痊愈的心情也最迫切；又因他们缺乏基本的医药卫生常识，所以在治疗过程中总是希望医生能及时地给予有效的治疗，并且希望医生能耐心地解答他们的疑问。但是，因为病人多，门诊工作有定额，每个医生每小时平均必须看九个病人，因此很难满足这些病人的要求；同时，在医生看来，这些慢性病不是一下子可以治好的，所以也就不愿意、实际上也不可能花许多时间向病人作解释工作。这一来，复诊病人一天一天增多，门诊工作也便更加忙乱起来。
    以上的情况表明，在我们医院里要克服门诊工作的忙乱现象，必须先从解决慢性病人问题着手。今年七月，我们医院召开了党、政、工、团的负责同志和各科室的医生、护士的会议，讨论怎样解决这个问题。会上初步确定了把同类型的慢性病人集中起来治疗的方针。这一方针，不仅可以提高对慢性病人的治疗效果，而且也可以改进我们的工作方法、医疗制度和克服门诊工作的忙乱现象。而在目前的情况下，也只有这样才有可能更好地发挥我们现有的医疗力量。
    七月底，我们开始调配了强有力的干部，充实了门诊的医疗力量，设立了慢性病诊察室，同时指定公共卫生护士在候诊室向候诊病人宣传慢性病集中治疗的优点，争取病人的信赖与合作。八月三日，我们便开始了肺结核患者的集中治疗。九月十四日、二十一日又分别开始了神经衰弱症和慢性关节炎患者的集中治疗。
    所谓慢性病集中治疗，就是把同一类型同等病情的慢性病人集中在同一时间内进行治疗。在进行集中治疗以前，我们首先将患有肺结核、神经衰弱症、风湿性关节炎的病人进行一次全面检查，然后按病情加以分类（如神经衰弱患者分为重度、中度、轻度三组），初诊的病人经诊断后也随时指定其参加某一组治疗。我们采用的治疗方法是：先由各诊察室的公共卫生护士根据病人的共同特点向病人进行候诊教育，使每一个病人都能充分地了解自己所患疾病的病源、病状、预后情况和疗养方法；医生则针对病人的思想情况进行特殊的教育和必要的解释，以便让病人正确地了解预防和护理等等的方法。由于在治疗前进行了充分的思想教育，医生也就能够集中力量进行治疗工作。三个月来，试行慢性病集中治疗的结果，证明在像我们这样拥有较多慢性病人的医院里采用这种治疗方法，不仅可以使医院有可能掌握每日的复诊人数，在最大限度内克服门诊工作的忙乱现象；而且，各技术室也能有准备地进行工作，提高工作效率。例如爱克斯光室和手术室可以在集中治疗的头一天大致了解决日需要透视和作手术的人数，药房可以知道某一部分病人需要什么样的药品，医生也可以集中精力研究次日诊断治疗中可能发生的问题。现在，我们医院的门诊忙乱现象已初步克服。过去，内科门诊的一个医生，如果要在一个上午看三十六个病人，就必须延长工作时间一、二小时。现在，普通内科门诊一个医生在一个上午就可以准时看完三十六个病人；而实行集中治疗的内科门诊，一个医生在一个上午就可以看四、五十个病人，有时可看六十个左右的病人。过去外科门诊不可能单独进行石蜡疗法，现在一上午可以给二十多个慢性关节炎病人做石蜡疗法了。目前，内科初诊病人一般都能在当天得到治疗，复诊病人的预约时间也大大地缩短了。
    由于实行了慢性病集中治疗，医生有了比较充裕的时间为病人进行详细的检查和治疗，病人感到医生较过去负责多了。病人达德山说：“肺结核病实行集中治疗以后，医生对每个病人都作了全面的了解，我们也摸清了自己的病状，因此我相信医生的诊断和所说的疗养方法都是正确的。假若早就这样做，我的病也早就好了。”病人胡瑞祥说：“过去医生不愿意花时间给我们讲神经衰弱症的道理，因此，我的思想上总有一个疙瘩。这次医生用很多的时间给病人讲解神经衰弱的病原和疗养方法，给我解除了个很大的思想包袱。”由于病类集中，医生也便于在病理和治疗方面进行研究，逐步提高专科治疗的技术水平。公共卫生护士和门诊护士对这些病症也逐渐地积累了系统的知识。病人经过候诊教育以后，掌握了一些基本的医药卫生知识，他们在其它地方也可以向其它病人进行宣传。
    但慢性病集中治疗，在我们医院还是一个新的尝试。我们希望和其它兄弟医院交流经验，以便继续改进工作，进一步地提高工作效率，更好地为人民服务。
