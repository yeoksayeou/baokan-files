Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 5th. The Korean-Chinese side conducted explanations to 124 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 on the 5th. In addition to continuing to use Kuomintang special agents to intimidate the prisoners of war, the U.S. side also openly dispatched aircraft to threaten them, attempting to deepen their feelings of doubt and fear, and prevent them from requesting repatriation. During the explanation process on the 5th, five U.S. military aircraft successively circled over the vicinity of the Dongchang-ri camp, exerting pressure on the prisoners of war. For several days, the U.S. side arranged for personnel entering the explanation camp to walk back and forth behind the row of sixteen explanation tents, i.e., outside the door for those applying for repatriation. Some U.S. military personnel were assigned to walk back and forth on the road from the explanation camp to the waiting tent for those applying for repatriation. This was clearly intended to make the prisoners of war recall the bloody "screening" scenes on Geoje Island deeply engraved in their memories, so that they would not dare to request repatriation.

During the explanation process, the American "Detaining Power Representative" in Explanation Tent No. 12, after a prisoner of war was brought into the tent, held out four fingers and shook his head towards the door for those not applying for repatriation, at which point the prisoner of war immediately began to shout and make a scene. Later, when an Indian guard stood between him and the prisoner of war, preventing the prisoner of war from seeing him, he stuck out one foot for the prisoner of war to see. After our side's interpreter reported this despicable act of the U.S. "representative" threatening the prisoner of war to the chairman of the subsidiary body, the chairman repeatedly warned the U.S. "representative." On one occasion, the chairman said to him: "This time I saw it with my own eyes, don't do it again!" But he still flatly denied it. When the explanation began in the afternoon, he even barbarously said to our side's interpreter: "I want to punch you in the nose!" After our side protested, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary body immediately announced the expulsion of this American "representative" who engaged in personal insults and threats from the venue.

In the same tent, the Swiss member of the subsidiary body actually poked our side's observer representative in the back with a bamboo stick. After our side's representative reported this to the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, it was said that the Swiss member admitted it was a "misunderstanding," but an Indian guard lieutenant who witnessed the situation at the time proved that this act of physical assault was intentional.

The situation of the explanation work on the 5th shows that the appalling reign of terror and mental torture that the U.S. side has imposed on the prisoners of war for the past two or three years has created extremely deep feelings of doubt and fear in the prisoners of war. It is understandable that these feelings of doubt and fear cannot be easily dispelled by tens of minutes or a few hours of explanation under the rampant interference of U.S. special agents. In Tent No. 16, a prisoner of war, apart from reciting a few sentences that the special agents had told him to say in advance as if he were reading a book, sat blankly in the tent for three hours. When our side's explanation representative told him that the people of the motherland were concerned about the suffering they had endured in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, tears welled up in his eyes. With only three minutes left until the end of the daily explanation time, the chairman of the subsidiary body urged him to make a decision, and beads of sweat suddenly appeared on his head. He placed his left leg on his right leg, then his right leg on his left leg, repeating this more than ten times, staring at the door for applying for repatriation, sighing repeatedly, but still not daring to speak. Therefore, our side's explanation representative requested the chairman of the subsidiary body to place him under separate custody and continue to provide him with explanations on the 6th.

Another prisoner of war, Li Tiancai, who applied for repatriation, when he heard the explanation representative say to him, "As long as you say you want to return to your country, you can be repatriated immediately," he excitedly said, "I have not had any freedom for a long time, now I am free!" However, when he heard the shouts in the neighboring tent, he panicked and asked the explanation representative: "Is it safe for me to go out from the repatriation door? Is there anyone to escort me?" Only after the explanation representative told him that safety was guaranteed did he dare to boldly apply for repatriation. The long-term influence of terror made him lower his head in fear as he walked out the door, holding the back of his head with both hands, and hurrying away as if he was afraid of being caught by someone.

Li Tiancai and another prisoner of war who applied for repatriation, Wang Wenxi, have already been repatriated to our side today.

The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to eight prisoners of war on the 5th has not yet been completed. In addition, more than 300 prisoners of war in Camp No. 22, who were originally scheduled to receive explanations on the 5th, have not yet received explanations. These prisoners of war will continue to receive explanations tomorrow. According to the provisions of the "Rules of Procedure Governing Explanations and Interviews," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should keep them and the prisoners of war who have already received explanations under separate custody. If they are sent back to the original camp together with the prisoners of war who have already undergone one explanation, it will constitute another violation of the "Rules of Procedure Governing Explanations and Interviews." The Korean-Chinese side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the morning of the 5th that it would continue to provide explanations to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 on the 6th, so that the custodial troops would have sufficient time to make separate custodial arrangements and preparations.

### 美方公然出动飞机配合特务恫吓战俘  五日听取解释的我被俘人员受到极大威胁

    美方公然出动飞机配合特务恫吓战俘
    五日听取解释的我被俘人员受到极大威胁
     【新华社开城五日电】朝中方面五日对第二十二号营场的一百二十四名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了解释。美方除了继续利用国民党特务恫吓战俘外，还公然出动飞机来对战俘进行威胁，企图加深他们的疑惧心理，使他们不敢要求遣返。在五日的解释过程中，有五架美军飞机先后在东场里营场附近上空盘旋，对战俘施加威胁。几天以来，美方布置他们进入解释营场的人员，在一排十六个解释帐篷的后面，即申请遣返的门外，来回走动。有的美军人员则被派在自解释营场通往申请遣返者等待帐篷的路上走来走去。这显然是为了使战俘记起深深镌在他们记忆中的巨济岛上血腥“甄别”的景象，因此不敢要求遣返。
    在解释工作进行中，第十二号解释帐篷的美国
  “拘留方代表”，在一名战俘被带进帐篷以后，他就伸出四个指头，并且把头向未申请遣返的门口摇幌，这时战俘马上就大叫大闹起来。以后当印度卫兵站在他与战俘之间时，使战俘看不见他时，他就伸出一只脚去，让战俘看见。我方译员把美方“代表”这种威胁战俘的卑鄙举动报告附属机构主席后，主席对美方“代表”一再提出警告。有一次，主席对他说：“这一次是我亲眼看见的，你不要再这样做！”但他仍然矢口抵赖。在下午开始解释时，他竟蛮横地向我方译员说：“我要揍你的鼻子！”我方提出抗议以后，中立国遣返委员会附属机构当即宣布把这个进行人身侮辱和威胁的美国“代表”驱逐出会场。
    在同一帐篷中，附属机构的瑞士委员竟用竹棍戳我方观察代表的后背。经我方代表向中立国遣返委员会人员提出后，据说这位瑞士委员承认是“误会”，但有一位亲眼看见当时情形的印度看管军中尉证明说，这种向人身施行袭击的行动是有意的。
    五日解释工作的情形显示：美方两、三年来对战俘所施行的骇人听闻的恐怖统治和精神折磨，已使战俘产生了极深的疑惧心理。可以理解，这种疑惧心理决非在美方特务猖狂干扰下的数十分钟或几个小时的解释所能轻易解除的。在第十六号帐篷，有一个战俘除了念书似地背诵了几句特务预先叫他说的话以外，呆呆地在帐篷里坐了三个钟点。当我方解释代表告诉他祖国人民关怀他们在美方战俘营中所受的痛苦时，他眼睛里泛出了泪水。离每天解释终止的时间只有三分钟时，附属机构的主席催他决定，他头上突然冒出了一粒粒的汗珠，把左腿搁在右腿上，又把右腿放在左腿上，反复十多次，两眼盯着申请遣返的门，连连叹气，但还不敢说话。因此，我方解释代表要求附属机构主席予以隔离看管，六日继续向他进行解释。
    另一个申请遣返的被俘人员李天才在听到解释代表对他说“只要你说一句要回国，马上就可以遣返”时，他虽然激动地说：“我长期得不到一点自由，现在可自由了！”可是，当他听到邻近帐篷中的叫嚷声时，便惊慌地问解释代表：“我从遣返门出去安全吗？有没有人护送？”解释代表告诉他安全有保证后，他才敢大胆申请遣返。长期的恐怖影响使他在走出门口时，还是恐惧地低着头，双手抱着后脑，急急忙忙地奔去，好像生怕被什么人抓住似的。
    李天才和另一名申请遣返的战俘王文喜，已在今天遣返我方。
    朝中方面在五日对八名战俘的解释工作尚未进行完毕。此外，还有原定在五日进行解释的三百多名二十二号营场中的战俘尚未听取解释。这些战俘将在明天继续听取解释。按照“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，中立国遣返委员会应把他们和已经听过解释的战俘分别看管。如果他们又和已经进行过一次解释的战俘一并被送回原营场，则将造成对“解释和访问工作细则”的又一次破坏。朝中方面五日上午已通知中立国遣返委员会，六日继续对二十二号营场中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释，以便看管部队有足够时间作分别看管的安排和准备。
