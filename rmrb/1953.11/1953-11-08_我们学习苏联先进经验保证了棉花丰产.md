    Our Study of Advanced Soviet Experience Guarantees Abundant Cotton Harvest
    All Members of the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative, Shanxi Province

    The 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is approaching. To commemorate this great festival, all members of our agricultural production cooperative would like to share our experiences and thoughts on how studying advanced Soviet experiences has improved our cotton production.

    We are all farmers who have grown cotton for many years. In the past, our irrigated cotton fields yielded at most 200 catties of seed cotton per mu, and our dry land fields yielded at most 100 catties of seed cotton per mu. Since studying advanced Soviet cotton planting experiences, especially the advanced Soviet experience of dense planting, our cotton production has doubled compared to the past, both last year and this year.

    Take Qu Yaoli, the director of our cooperative, for example. In the past, he also planted only about 2,000 seedlings per mu, so his annual yield was only 100 to 200 catties. In 1951, after comrades from the farm introduced him to the Soviet experience of dense cotton planting, he experimented with planting two mu, increasing the number of seedlings per mu from 2,000 to 3,160. As a result, he harvested 912 catties of seed cotton per mu, creating a new national record for abundant cotton production.

    Last year, when our cooperative was still a mutual aid team, we adopted this advanced experience and universally implemented dense planting in all our cotton fields. In high-yield areas, we planted more than 3,500 seedlings per mu. Consequently, our mutual aid team's cotton fields also achieved large-scale production increases last year. Since last winter, we have placed even greater emphasis on studying advanced Soviet experiences. This year, our agricultural production cooperative not only paid more attention to dense cotton planting, but also made significant improvements in cotton field management, cultivation, and fertilization techniques under the guidance of advanced Soviet science and technology. For example, in the past, we applied powdered fertilizer as base manure. This year, we learned the Soviet method of manufacturing granular fertilizer and used "superphosphate" mixed with cow dung and rice bran to create 240 catties of granular fine fertilizer. We applied an additional 12 catties of granular fine fertilizer per mu as base manure in high-yield areas. Because granular fertilizer can more effectively concentrate its fertilizing effect compared to powdered fertilizer, it ensured the healthy and uniform growth of cotton seedlings this year. This spring, our cooperative's high-yield cotton fields suffered from severe seedling loss due to seedling blight. To remedy this loss, we adopted the Soviet method of "vernalizing cotton seeds" for spring replanting, thus reversing the severe situation of missing seedlings and broken ridges in our high-yield cotton fields. In addition, because we constantly learned about advanced Soviet science and technology from newspapers and magazines, we were able to carry out watering and pruning work in our cotton fields in a more reasonable and timely manner this year.

    From our actual production, we deeply realize that our cotton can achieve abundant harvests year after year because of the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and especially because of the result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet elder brother, and also the result of the selfless assistance of the Soviet elder brother. Therefore, as we celebrate the great October Socialist Revolution this year, all of our cooperative members pledge to further study the advanced experiences of the Soviet elder brother in the future, and to promote the techniques we learn at any time, to cooperate with the patriotic production increase and economy campaign launched throughout the country, to cooperate with the general task of gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, to produce more and better cotton, and to support national economic construction.

### 我们学习苏联先进经验保证了棉花丰产

    我们学习苏联先进经验保证了棉花丰产
    山西曲耀离农业生产合作社全体社员
    十月社会主义革命三十六周年纪念节来到了。为了纪念这个伟大的节日，我们农业生产合作社的全体社员，愿把学习苏联先进经验后，提高了棉花产量的经过和感想谈一谈。
    我们都是种了许多年棉花的农民。可是过去我们的水地棉花每亩顶多收籽棉二百多斤，旱地每亩顶多收籽棉一百多斤。自从学习了苏联先进的植棉经验，特别是学习了苏联棉花密植的先进经验后，去年和今年，我们的棉花产量就比过去提高了一倍。
    就拿我们社的社长曲耀离来说吧，在过去，他的棉花也是每亩留两千多株苗，所以每年的产量也是一、二百斤。一九五一年农场同志向他介绍了苏联棉花密植的经验后，他试种了二亩，每亩由过去留两千株苗增加到三千一百六十株，结果每亩收籽棉九百一十二斤，创造了全国棉花丰产的新纪录。
    去年，我们社还是互助组的时候，接受了这个先进经验，在全组棉田里普遍实行了密植，丰产地每亩留苗三千五百多株，因而，我们互助组的棉田去年也获得了大面积增产。从去年冬天以来，我们就更加重视学习苏联的先进经验，今年我们农业生产合作社不但更加注意了棉花密植，同时在苏联先进科学技术的指导下，在棉田管理、耕作与施肥技术上也有了大大的改进。比如以往我们施的底粪是粉沫状肥料，今年我们学习了苏联颗粒状肥料的制造法，就用“过磷酸钙”拌搅牛粪及谷糠，制造了二百四十斤颗粒状的细肥，在丰产地内每亩增施了十二斤颗粒状细肥的底粪。由于颗粒状肥料较粉沫状肥料更能集中地发挥肥效，因而保证了今年棉苗生长的健旺和整齐。今年春天，我们社的丰产棉田因立枯病造成了严重的缺苗现象，为了补救这个损失，我们又采用了苏联“春化棉种”的办法，进行了春化补种，从而转变了丰产棉田严重的缺苗断垅情况。此外，由于我们经常不断地从报纸上、杂志上学习苏联的先进科学技术，使我们今年棉田的浇水工作、整杈打切工作，都做得很合理适时。
    我们从实际生产中，深深地体会到：我们的棉花能够连年丰产，是因为共产党和人民政府领导的结果；特别是因为学习了苏联老大哥先进经验的结果，也是苏联老大哥对我们无私援助的结果。因此，当今年庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命节的时候，我们全体社员保证今后进一步学习苏联老大哥的先进经验，并要把学到的技术随时推广，以配合在全国范围内展开的爱国主义增产节约运动，配合我国逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的总任务，生产出更多更好的棉花，支援国家经济建设。
