    Our Country Must Carry Out Socialist Transformation
    Liao Gailong
    The general line for our country's transition to socialism states that, over a considerably long period, we must gradually realize socialist industrialization while simultaneously carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. The previous article discussed industrialization; now, we will discuss socialist transformation.

    I. What is Socialist Transformation?

    Socialist transformation means changing economic sectors that are not socialist into socialist economic sectors. In other words, it means changing the private ownership of the means of production into the public ownership of the means of production.

    The land, farm tools, machinery, factories, mines, etc., that people use for production are called the means of production. The food, clothing, housing, fuel, etc., that people use to sustain their lives are called the means of subsistence. Any economy in which the means of production are privately owned is called a private economy. Any economy in which the means of production are jointly owned by the working people is a socialist economy.

    The phenomenon of exploitation of man by man originates from the private ownership of the means of production. Landlords and rich peasants occupy land and various other agricultural means of production. Based on these, they can exploit peasants. Capitalists occupy machines and factories. Based on these, they can exploit workers. Therefore, to eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation, we must eliminate the private ownership of the means of production. Implementing the socialist system of public ownership of the means of production will forever prevent the recurrence of exploitation.

    Socialist public ownership refers to the public ownership of the means of production. It does not mean that all the means of subsistence that individuals use, such as food, clothing, and housing, should be taken over for public ownership. Under the socialist system, everyone can earn their income through labor. They can have their own housing, household goods, and daily necessities. Items for personal consumption and enjoyment are personal property, entirely under the free control of the individual, and can also be inherited by their children.

    Under the socialist system, all means of production are publicly owned, and workers and peasants can all have work to do. They will not be unable to survive because they lack the means of production. The fruits of labor will not be exploited by others, and every laborer will receive the remuneration they deserve. The more and better one labors, the more one's income will be. This is called "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."

    Some people say, "Socialism means taking all the things produced and distributing them equally. Even those unwilling to work can get the same share. So, implementing socialism rewards lazy people and good-for-nothings." This is completely wrong. In fact, since socialism does not allow anyone to live by exploiting others without working, it naturally opposes lazy people and good-for-nothings. All those who are able to work must work, "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." As for those who have lost their ability to work, society and the state will naturally provide them with ample assistance. Therefore, all working people should support the socialist system and oppose the system of exploitation.

    Our country's current state-owned enterprises are already a socialist public economy, because all the property in state-owned enterprises is publicly owned by all the people. But our country still has these two types of private economies: The first is the economy of individual peasants and independent handicraftsmen. The means of production in this economy are privately owned by the peasants and handicraftsmen themselves. They use their own means of production to engage in labor, so it is called an individual private economy. The second is private industry and commerce (including private handicraft workshops). The means of production in this economy are occupied by capitalists. They hire workers to work and exploit workers and other people, so it is called a capitalist economy.

    Socialist transformation means transforming the above two types of economies into socialist economies.

    II. Socialist Transformation in Agriculture

    In our country's vast rural areas, after the land reform, the land private ownership system of the landlord class has been eliminated. Peasants are no longer subject to feudal exploitation, and their lives have greatly improved. But after the land reform, peasants still live in an individual economy. Peasants cultivate their own small plots of land as individual households. The manpower used is limited to individual households, and the farm tools used are only simple farm tools. This situation is called the individual economy of agriculture. Implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture mainly means changing this individual economy and implementing socialist public ownership in rural areas.

    Perhaps some people say that peasants live by their own labor on their own land, and there is no exploitation here, so there is no need for socialist transformation. This view is incorrect. Individual peasants are all eager to become wealthier. If they do not take the socialist path of mutual aid and cooperation, and they have surplus grain and money, they will lend money, hire labor, or engage in business to make money, implementing exploitation. Many other peasants, because of their weak economic base, lack of manpower, poor management, or due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, cannot develop their economy, and are further exploited by wealthy households, will become poor, even to the point of borrowing money, selling land, and becoming hired laborers. From this, it can be seen that the individual economy of peasants itself is not a system of exploitation, but a system of exploitation can arise from it. This is because the individual economy is still a private ownership system of the means of production. In order to eliminate the system of exploitation and enable every peasant to become richer day by day, this small private ownership system of peasants must be turned into a public ownership system.

    When we eliminated the land private ownership of the landlord class, we adopted the method of confiscating the landlords' land. But changing the small private ownership system of peasants must absolutely not adopt the method of confiscation. Landlords are a small group of exploiters who do not work and gain without labor. Individual economy peasants are a very large number of self-reliant laborers. Changing the small private ownership system of peasants is to make the peasants' lives better and better, and to never be exploited again. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to treat peasants with the method of confiscation and turning over to the public.

    The method of socialist transformation of agriculture is to lead peasants to unite and organize into cooperatives. Under normal circumstances, the first step is to organize mutual aid teams. In mutual aid teams, land and other means of production are privately owned, but labor is carried out collectively. Therefore, mutual aid teams already have the nature of socialist sprouts. The second step is to organize agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature. In this kind of cooperative, land is still privately owned, but it is used jointly, and some of the means of production are also publicly owned, so this is of a semi-socialist nature. After further progress, it can be developed into agricultural production cooperatives (i.e., collective farms) of a socialist nature, where the means of production are completely publicly owned.

    This socialist public ownership system in agriculture is slightly different from the socialist public ownership system in industry. All the property in socialist factories is state-owned, that is, publicly owned by all the working people of the country (ownership by the whole people). But the various public properties in socialist agricultural production cooperatives are not state-owned, but jointly owned by the members of the cooperative (collective ownership by members of the cooperative). Both of these public ownership systems are socialist, can eliminate exploitation, eliminate classes, and can guarantee that everyone can live a prosperous life.

    Using this step-by-step method to achieve the goal of realizing socialism is beneficial to the vast majority of peasants, so it is a method that can be accepted by the vast majority of peasants.

    III. Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce

    Private industry and commerce is a capitalist system, a system of exploitation.

    In capitalist countries like the United States and Britain, capitalists control the political power. Therefore, in those countries, to change from capitalism to socialism, workers and peasants must rise up to carry out a revolution, overthrow the capitalists' political power, and confiscate the capitalists' property.

    In our China, although there is still private industry and commerce, the capitalist economy does not occupy a dominant position in the entire national economy, and the state power is also in the hands of the working people. Therefore, we can use the power of the state to gradually carry out socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in accordance with the interests of the people. Now, because state-owned industry has not developed enough, private industry and commerce, as long as they are restricted and guided, can still play a certain role in the national economy and the people's livelihood. They can produce things that state-owned industries do not produce enough of, and can also help state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the government's policy towards private industry and commerce now is a policy of utilization, restriction, and gradual transformation.

    The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce must be done in two steps: The first step is to restrict exploitation; the second step is to eliminate exploitation.

    The first step is to restrict the exploitation of private industry and commerce. This means that the state will gradually manage private industry and commerce, making them obey the leadership and supervision of the state, preventing them from engaging in speculation and profiteering, tax evasion, or excessive exploitation of workers and peasants, making them produce things for the state according to the state's plan, buy and sell goods for the state, and gradually become joint state-private industry and commerce. In short, it is to make private industry and commerce cooperate with the state-owned economy, which is called the "state capitalism economy." This matter is now being done by the state in a step-by-step manner.

    The second step, after a considerable period of time, is to transform the state capitalism economy into a socialist state-owned economy, that is, an economy owned by all the people.

    IV. Socialist Transformation Must Be Implemented

    If we only develop state-owned socialist industry, and do not carry out socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and of agriculture and handicrafts, will that work?

    No. Because the working people of the whole country demand the realization of the entire socialist society, and only the entire socialist society can eliminate classes and make the country strong and the people rich. Half-baked socialism, isolated socialist industry, cannot develop and cannot solve the problems of the country and the people. If we do not carry out socialist transformation of capitalist private industry and commerce, they will conflict with the socialist economy, making socialist industry unable to develop. The current example of unscrupulous merchants disrupting grain work is one example.

    It is also necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. This is because, first, the production volume of the individual private economy is too small to meet the needs of the rapid development of the country's industrial construction. Second, the individual private economy is each person producing their own things, making it difficult to obey the state's plan, and it is also difficult for the state to formulate a plan for it. This will inevitably lead to the state's industry not being able to get the close cooperation of agriculture, and will also be hindered and sabotaged. Because individual economic production is unplanned, if some things are produced less, it will cause a shortage of materials; if some things are produced more, it will cause waste. Third, if the individual private economy does not develop towards socialism, it will generate a system of exploitation, and peasants and workers will be exploited; the people cannot enjoy happiness, and the country cannot be peaceful. These situations are of course very unfavorable to our country and all the people.

                ×　×　×

    In summary: on the one hand, gradually developing our country's socialist industry, and on the other hand, gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. By doing this, after a considerably long period, we can make our country a socialist country, an industrial country, a prosperous and happy country. This is the general line that the Communist Party has formulated for our country during the current transition period.

    Implementing this general line is the general task of the people of the whole country, and it is also the general task of the peasants of the whole country.

    我们的国家要进行社会主义改造
    廖盖隆
    我们国家过渡到社会主义去的总路线，说的是要在一个相当长的时期内一步一步实现社会主义工业化，同时还要进行对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。前面一篇文章已经讲过工业化，现在我们就来讲社会主义改造。
    一、什么叫做社会主义改造
    所谓社会主义改造，就是说要把本来不是社会主义的经济，改变成为社会主义的经济。也就是说，要把生产资料私有制，改变成为生产资料公有制。
    人们用来进行生产的土地、农具、机器、工厂、矿山等等，叫做生产资料。人们用来维持生活的食品、衣服、住房、燃料等等叫做生活资料。凡是生产资料归私人占有的经济，叫做私有经济。凡是生产资料归劳动人民共同占有的经济，就是社会主义经济。
    人剥削人的现象是由生产资料的私有制度而来的。地主、富农占有土地和其他各种农业生产资料，凭着这些，他们就可以剥削农民；资本家占有机器、工厂，凭着这些，他们就可以剥削工人。所以要消灭剥削现象，就一定要消灭生产资料的私有制度。实行了生产资料公有的社会主义制度，就永远不会再有人剥削人的情形。
    社会主义的公有制度是指生产资料归公有，并不是要把吃的、穿的、住的，个人用的一切生活资料都拿来归公。在社会主义制度下面，每个人可以由劳动而得到自己的收入。他们可以有自己的住房，有家常和日用器具，个人消费和享乐用的东西，这些都是个人的财产，完全归个人自己自由支配，也可以由子女来继承。
    在社会主义制度下，一切生产资料都归公有，工人和农民就都能有工做，不会因为没有生产资料而活不成。劳动的结果不会被别人剥削去，每个劳动者都能得到应有的报酬。劳动得越多越好，收入也就越多。这就叫做“各尽所能，按劳取酬”。
    有人说：“社会主义，就是生产出来的东西拿来打乱平分。不愿意劳动的人也可以同样分到一份。所以，实行社会主义就是奖励了懒人和二流子。”这话是完全不对的。其实，社会主义既然不准许任何人自己不劳动而靠剥削别人过活，当然就是反对懒汉和二流子的。一切能劳动的人都必须劳动，“不劳动者不得食”。至于那些丧失了劳动力的人，社会和国家自然要给以充分的帮助。所以一切劳动人民都要拥护社会主义制度，反对剥削制度。
    我国现在的国营企业已经是社会主义的公有经济，因为国营企业中的一切财产都是全体人民公有的。但我国现在还有这样两种私有经济：第一种是个体农民和独立手工业者的经济，这种经济的生产资料是归农民和手工业者自己私有的，他们自己使用自己的生产资料进行生产的劳动，所以叫做个体私有经济；第二种是私营工商业（包括私营的工场手工业在内），这种经济的生产资料是由资本家占有的，他们雇用工人做工，剥削工人和其他人民，所以叫做资本主义经济。
    社会主义改造，就是要把上面这两种经济改造成为社会主义经济。
    二、在农业中的社会主义改造
    我国的广大农村中，在实行土地改革后，已经消灭了地主阶级的土地私有制度。农民不再受封建剥削，生活是大大改善了。但是土地改革后农民过的还是个体经济的生活。农民以一家一户为单位在自己所有的一块一块的小的土地上进行耕种，所用的人力只能以一家一户为限，所用的农具也只能是简单的农具，这种情形就叫做农业的个体经济。实行农业的社会主义改造，主要的就是要改变这种个体经济，在农村中实行社会主义的公有制。
    也许有人说，农民在自己的田地里靠自己劳动生活，这里并没有剥削制度，所以也就不需要进行社会主义改造。这种看法是不对的。个体农民都是争先恐后地想使自己更富裕起来。他们如果不走互助合作的社会主义道路，又有了余粮余钱，就会放债雇工或者做买卖赚钱，实行剥削。其他许多农民因为家底薄，人力少，经营不善或由于天灾人祸的原因，经济不能发展，再受到富户的剥削，就会穷下来，以至借债，卖地，做雇工。由此可见，农民的个体经济本身固然不是剥削制度，但是从这里面却会产生出剥削制度来。这就因为个体经济还是一种生产资料的私有制度的缘故。为了消灭剥削制度，使农民个个人都能一天比一天富裕，就一定要把这种农民的小私有制度变成公有制度才行。
    我们在消灭地主阶级的土地私有制时，采取了没收地主土地的办法。但是改变农民的小私有制度却绝对不能采取没收的办法。地主是一小撮不劳而获的剥削者，个体经济的农民是人数极多的自食其力的劳动者。改变农民的小私有制度却是为了使农民的日子越过越好，永远不再受剥削。所以用没收交公的办法来对待农民，那是绝对不允许的。
    对农业的社会主义改造，办法就是领导农民联合起来，组织成为合作社。在一般的情形下，第一步先组织互助组。在互助组里，土地和其他生产资料都是私有的，但劳动已是集体进行。所以互助组已带有社会主义萌芽的性质。第二步是组织半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，在这种合作社里，土地还是私有的，但是联合使用，生产资料也有一部分是公有的，所以这是半社会主义性质的。以后再进一步，就可以发展到生产资料完全归公有的社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（即集体农场）。
    在农业中的这种社会主义公有制度，和工业中的社会主义公有制度有一点差别。社会主义工厂中的全部财产都是国有的，也就是归全国劳动人民所公有（全民所有制）。但在社会主义的农业生产合作社里的各种公有财产却并不是国有的，而是归这个合作社的社员们共同所有（合作社社员集体所有制）。这两种公有制度都是社会主义，都能消灭剥削，消灭阶级，都能保证人人可以过富裕的生活。
    用这样逐步进行的办法来达到实现社会主义的目的，对最大多数农民都有利，所以是能够为最广大的农民所接受的办法。
    三、对私营工商业的社会主义改造
    私营工商业是资本主义制度，是一种剥削制度。
    在像美国英国那样的资本主义国家，资本家掌握着政权。所以在那些国家里，要从资本主义变到社会主义，就一定要工人农民起来进行革命，推翻资本家的政权，没收资本家的财产。
    在我们中国，现在虽然还有私营工商业，但是资本主义经济在整个国民经济中不占统治地位，国家政权也是由劳动人民做主。所以我们就可以用国家的力量来按照人民的利益而对私营工商业逐步进行社会主义的改造。现在因为国营的工业还发展得不够多，私营工商业只要加以限制和领导，对于国计民生，还可以有一定程度的作用。它们可以生产国营工业还生产得不够多的东西，还可以帮助国营商业和供销合作社发展城乡物资交流，所以，现在政府对私营工商业的政策，是利用、限制和一步一步加以改造的政策。
    对私营工商业的社会主义改造，要分两步来做：第一步是限制剥削；第二步是消灭剥削。
    第一步，限制私营工商业的剥削。这就是要由国家来把私营工商业一步一步地管理起来，使它们服从国家的领导和监督，使它们不能投机倒把、不能偷税漏税、不能过分剥削工人和农民，使它们按照国家的计划替国家生产东西，替国家买卖货物，使它们一步一步地变成公私合营的工商业。总之，就是要使私营工商业和国营经济合作，这就叫做“国家资本主义经济”。这件事，现在国家正在有步骤地来做。
    第二步，经过相当长的时间以后，再把国家资本主义经济，改变成为社会主义的国营经济，也就是全体人民所有的经济。
    四、必须实行社会主义改造
    如果我们只是发展国营的社会主义的工业，而不去实行对私营工商业和对农业、手工业的社会主义改造，行不行呢？
    不行。因为全国劳动人民要求实现的是整个的社会主义社会，只有整个的社会主义社会才能做到消灭阶级，国强民富。半截的社会主义，孤立的社会主义工业，是不可能发展起来的，是不可能解决国家和人民的问题的。如果不对资本主义的私营工商业实行社会主义改造，它们就要同社会主义经济起冲突，使社会主义工业不能发展，像现在的奸商破坏粮食工作，就是一个例子。
    对农业和手工业也非实行社会主义改造不行。这是因为第一、个体私有经济的生产量太少，不能满足国家工业建设急速发展的需要。第二、个体私有经济是各人生产各人的东西，很难服从国家的计划，国家也很难替它订出计划。这样就势必使国家的工业得不到农业的密切合作，并且还会受到妨碍和破坏。因为个体经济生产没有计划，有些东西生产少了，就要造成物资缺乏；有些东西生产多了，就要造成浪费。第三、个体私有经济不向社会主义发展，就会产生剥削制度，农民和工人就要受到剥削；人民不能享受幸福，国家也不能平安。这些情形，对于我们国家和全体人民当然是非常不利的。
                ×　×　×
    总起来说：一面逐步发展我们国家的社会主义工业，一面逐步实现对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造，这样做，经过一个相当长的时期后，就能使我们的国家成为一个社会主义的国家，成为一个工业国家，成为一个富强幸福的国家。这就是共产党定出来的我们国家在目前过渡时期的总路线。
    实行这个总路线，这就是全国人民的总任务，这也就是全国农民的总任务。
