Central industrial and transportation departments and major regional local state-owned industrial systems are stepping up the compilation of production and capital construction plans for 1954.

The State Planning Commission issued the 1954 national plan targets in early October. In recent months, the central industrial and transportation ministries have distributed the national plan targets to grassroots units. Factories and mining enterprises that started early and prepared adequately have begun organizing discussions among workshop employees. Some enterprises have already completed discussions of their plans at the workshop level. When deploying the compilation of the 1954 plan, most ministries convened planning meetings to review the implementation of the 1953 national plan, learn from experiences and lessons, and clearly define the principles and steps for compiling the 1954 plan. The railway department reviewed the compilation and implementation of the plan over the past two years: when compiling the 1952 plan, the estimate of freight growth deviated from reality in some respects, and the plan was set too high, resulting in many difficulties and shortcomings in the implementation of the plan. When compiling the 1953 plan, the increase in railway transportation volume after the start of the country's planned economic construction was underestimated, resulting in a conservative plan that did not concentrate investment in operating lines on the main aspects related to transportation, which also caused some adverse consequences. Accepting the above experience and lessons, the railway department decided that the compilation of the 1954 plan must be realistic, and the phenomenon of plan deviation should be prevented. The Ministry of Fuel Industry examined the main reasons why the product of the coal mine industry system under its jurisdiction failed to complete the national plan in the first half of this year. Some units neglected tunneling work and long-term neglect of underground geological work, so that tunneling could not meet the requirements of mining, and geological work could not keep up with tunneling. In order to correct this bias, the ministry decided to take the following measures when compiling the 1954 plan: the coal mine industry must formulate feasible tunneling and mining plans based on the output required by the state and the resources of the mine, rationally arrange tunneling work, and always maintain six to ten months of preparation gain; and it is necessary to formulate advanced technical and economic norms and gradually increasing quarterly plans to promote the continuous advancement of the coal mine industry. When deploying capital construction plans, all ministries emphasized concentrating resources to meet the needs of key projects and projects that can rapidly increase production capacity; and they must carefully consider resource conditions, design and construction forces, equipment and material supply according to needs and possibilities, and conduct accurate balancing work. Projects that do not meet the conditions should not be included in the plan to prevent blind advancement, and those that meet the conditions for inclusion in the plan must overcome difficulties and ensure completion. At the same time as issuing national plan targets, each ministry and professional administration bureau dispatched working groups to go deep into grassroots units to inspect and assist in the progress of plan compilation.

Most major regions held meetings on plan compilation in mid-October, and by the end of the month, the national plan targets had been basically distributed to grassroots units. Units that started early have begun to compile plans. When deploying the 1954 plan, all major regions paid attention to giving full play to the enthusiasm of local state-owned industries, tapping potential forces, and increasing production. Before compiling the plan, the financial and economic committees of each province and city in North China convened meetings of industrial, commercial, and statistical departments to study the production and sales of important products so that each department could effectively formulate the 1954 plan. Most of the plan compilation work in Chongqing was attended by people from the Industrial Bureau, who reviewed it while doing it; key industries also organized central groups to specialize in studying the problems of each factory and helping to sort out the 1953 data to determine the indicators. Shanghai has held a planning meeting, and grassroots factories and mines have begun to compile plans at the end of October. The local state-owned industrial management department of the Northwest region has sent more than 40 people to various provinces to help work. The local state-owned industrial system of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued the national plan targets in mid-October, and by the end of October, grassroots units had taken action.

    中央各工业交通部门，各大区地方工业系统
    积极编制明年的生产和建设计划
    中央各工业及交通运输部门所属企业、各大区地方国营工业系统，正加紧编制一九五四年度生产与基本建设计划。
    国家计划委员会于十月初颁发了一九五四年度国家计划指标。近月以来，中央各工业及交通运输各部，均已分别将国家计划指标下达到基层单位。动手早、准备工作做得充分的厂矿企业，已开始组织车间职工讨论，个别企业计划已在车间讨论完毕。各部在布置一九五四年度计划的编制工作时，大都召开了计划会议，检查了一九五三年度国家计划执行的情况，从而吸取经验教训，明确规定了编制一九五四年度计划的方针与步骤。铁道部门检查了过去两年计划的编制与执行情况：一九五二年编制计划时，由于对货运增长的估计在某些方面脱离了实际，把计划提得过高，因而在执行计划中发生了不少困难和缺点；一九五三年编制计划时，又因为对国家有计划经济建设开始后铁路运输数量的增长估计不足，以致计划偏于保守，没有把营业线路的投资集中使用到与运输有关的主要方面去，也造成某些不良后果。接受上述的经验教训，铁道部门决定，编制一九五四年的计划必须力求切合实际，防止计划偏高或偏低的现象发生。燃料工业部检查了所属煤矿工业系统今年上半年产品未完成国家计划的主要原因是某些单位忽视掘进工作和长期忽视井下地质工作，致使掘进不能满足回采的要求，地质工作又赶不上掘进。为纠正这个偏向，该部决定在编制一九五四年计划时采取如下措施：煤矿工业必须根据国家要求的产量，结合矿井资源情况，制订切实可行的掘进与回采计划，合理地布置掘进工作，经常保持六个月至十个月的准备获得量；并且要制订出先进的技术经济定额和逐步上升的季度计划，推动煤矿工业不断前进。各部在布置基本建设计划时，都强调集中使用力量，满足重点工程和能迅速增长生产能力的工程的需要；并必须根据需要与可能周密考虑，对资源条件，设计与施工力量，设备与材料供应，确切地进行平衡工作，条件不具备的不要列入计划，防止冒进，有条件列入计划的则必须克服困难，保证完成。各部及各专业管理局与下达国家计划指标的同时，分别派出工作组，深入基层单位检查与协助编制计划工作的进行。
    各大区大都在十月中旬开过有关编制计划的会议，至月底基本上已将国家计划指标下达到基层单位，动手早的单位已展开编制工作。各大区在布置一九五四年度计划时，都注意到充分发挥地方国营工业的积极性，挖掘潜在力量，增加生产。华北区在编制计划前，各省、市财经委员会召集工业、商业、统计等部门开会，研究了重要产品的产销情况，以便各部门切实制订一九五四年的计划。重庆市大部企业的计划编制工作都由工业局派人参加，一边做一边审核；重点行业还组织了中心组，专门研究各厂发生的问题，并帮助整理一九五三年的资料，确定指标。上海市已开过计划会议，十月底各基层厂矿已开始编制计划。西北区地方国营工业主管部门已派出四十余人到各省帮助工作。内蒙古自治区地方国营工业系统已于十月中旬下达了国家计划指标，至十月底，基层单位已经行动起来。
