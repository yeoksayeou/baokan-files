Xinhua News Agency, 21st. The National General Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association concluded its plenary session on the 21st. After thirteen days of meetings, the attending committee members enhanced their understanding of the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, and based on the requirements of the general line and general tasks, determined the future work guidelines and central tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

During the meeting, the attending committee members listened to the opening speech by Chairman Huang Yanpei. In his opening speech, Huang Yanpei called on all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association to mobilize, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to unite private industrialists and businessmen and strive to implement the country's general line and general tasks during the transition period. The attending committee members also listened to the work report of the General Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association by Vice Chairman Sheng Peihua, and listened to the report on the draft resolution on convening the National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association by Vice Chairman Shi Fuliang.

In his report, Sheng Peihua said that the China Democratic National Construction Association must vigorously conduct patriotic and law-abiding education in the future and strive to eliminate the illegal behavior of its members. It should organize members to thoroughly study the country's general line during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, with particular emphasis on the study of state capitalism policies, and take exemplary actions to lead other industrialists and businessmen to sincerely accept socialist transformation. At the same time, it should conduct investigations and research on the enterprises of its members, especially those enterprises that have a significant impact on the national economy and those that are state capitalist in nature, in order to assist the government in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. He went on to say that those members who have made significant achievements in public-private partnerships, accepting processing orders, improving production and business management, carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and responding to various patriotic movements should be commended; those who have incorrect and erroneous ideas and behaviors in these aspects should be criticized, educated, and even punished.

Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, was invited to speak at the meeting.

Through this meeting, the attending committee members further clearly recognized that patriotism and law-abidingness are a serious and crucial issue for private industrialists and businessmen. They recognized that truly patriotic industrialists and businessmen can abide by state laws and regulations, thus both complying with the interests of the state and ensuring their own legitimate interests. They expressed their intention to adopt a correct stance, a positive attitude, consciously abide by all state policies and laws and regulations, launch patriotic and law-abiding education, advocate an honest and down-to-earth style, and strive to become models of patriotism and law-abidingness.

The congress passed the "Resolution on Approving the Opening Speech of Chairman Huang Yanpei and the Work Report of the Standing Committee" and the "Resolution on Convening the National Congress."

When the congress passed the telegram of salute to Chairman Mao, the applause lasted for a long time. Then, it passed the telegram of salute to the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Finally, Vice Chairman Li Zhuchen delivered the closing speech. He said that it is an honor for the China Democratic National Construction Association to dedicate itself to the construction cause of gradually transitioning to socialism. We should, with a joyful mood and firm will, mobilize, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite private industrialists and businessmen, and advance bravely to implement the country's general line during the transition period!

    民建总会委员会全体会议闭幕
    决议开展爱国守法教育，协助政府对
    私营工商业进行社会主义改造的工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国民主建国会总会委员会全体会议二十一日闭幕。经过十三天的会议，到会委员提高了对国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的认识，并根据总路线和总任务的要求，确定了中国民主建国会今后的工作方针和中心任务。
    在会议中，到会委员听取了黄炎培主任委员的开幕词，黄炎培在开幕词中，号召中国民主建国会全体会员动员起来，在中国共产党的领导下，团结私营工商业者，为贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务而奋斗。到会委员又听取了盛丕华副主任委员关于中国民主建国会总常务委员会工作报告，听取了施复亮副主任委员关于召开中国民主建国会全国代表大会决议草案的报告。
    盛丕华在报告中说，中国民主建国会今后必须大力进行爱国守法教育，为肃清会员的违法行为而斗争。应组织会员深入学习国家过渡时期的总路线以及第一个五年计划的基本任务，特别着重对国家资本主义政策的学习，并以模范行动带动其他工商业者真诚接受社会主义的改造。同时对会员有关的企业，首先是对国民经济有重大作用的企业和属于国家资本主义性质的企业的情况，进行调查研究，以便协助政府对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的工作。他接着说，会员中能够在公私合营、接受加工订货和改进生产经营管理、开展增产节约运动、响应各项爱国运动等方面有显著成绩者，要表扬；对这些方面有不正确以及错误的思想和行为者，应批评、教育以至处分。
    中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉曾应邀在会议上讲了话。
    经过这次会议，到会委员进一步明确认识到爱国守法是私营工商业者一个严重的关键问题。认清了真正爱国的工商业者，就能够遵守国家的法令，这样既能服从国家的利益，又能保证个人的合法利益。他们表示要采取正确的立场，积极的态度，自觉地遵守国家的一切政策法令，展开爱国守法的教育，倡导老老实实的作风，争取成为爱国守法的模范。
    大会通过了“关于同意黄炎培主任委员开幕词和常务委员会工作报告的决议”，通过了“关于召开全国代表大会的决议”。
    当大会通过向毛主席致敬电时，掌声经久不息。接着又通过了向中国人民志愿军致敬电。
    最后，李烛尘副主任委员致闭幕词。他说，中国民主建国会能够献身于为逐步过渡到社会主义的建设事业而斗争，是光荣的。我们应该以愉快的心情，坚定的意志，动员起来，在中国共产党领导下，团结私营工商业者，为贯彻国家过渡时期总路线而奋勇前进！
