    When I Met My Chinese Father
    Cui ?
    What a joyful day! I met my Chinese father in Pyongyang, the father I always remember.
    It was not easy for us to meet! The moment I met and shook hands with my father from China, my heart was pounding. I thought of that cold morning when Brother Shengjiao rescued me from the frozen river.... And he gloriously gave his life. Brother Shengjiao fought bravely at the front and lost his life to save me in the rear. He is a hero who defends peace, a great internationalist fighter. I will always learn from him!
    With tears of gratitude in my eyes, I said to my father from China: "Since Brother Shengjiao's glorious sacrifice, I have been missing you all the time. In the past year, inspired by Brother Shengjiao's great internationalist spirit and strong fighting will, I have been working hard to study. I must inherit Brother Shengjiao's legacy, study and work hard, and be a good son to you."
    This is what I thought of when I first met my father from China. Dear father! Dear Volunteer Army brothers! Respected Chairman Mao! I will always be grateful to you and determined to always be your good son and good brother, and at the same time, be a good soldier dedicated to the cause of peace.

    当我和中国父亲见面的时候
    崔?
    这是一个多么快活的日子啊！我和我时刻怀念着的中国的父亲在平壤见了面。
    我们能够见面，是多么不容易的事啊！当我和从中国来的父亲见面握手的一瞬间，我的心在激烈地跳动着。我想起了那个寒冷的早晨，盛教哥哥把我从冰冻的河里救出来……。而他，却光荣地献出了自己的生命。盛教哥哥在前方英勇作战，在后方又为了救我而丧失了生命。他是一个保卫和平的英雄，是一个伟大的国际主义战士。我要永远向他学习！
    我含着感激的眼泪对从中国来的父亲说：“从盛教哥哥光荣牺牲后，我无时无刻不在想念您老人家。近一年来，我在盛教哥哥的伟大国际主义精神和坚强的战斗意志鼓舞下，正在努力地学习。我一定要继承盛教哥哥的遗志，好好念书和工作，作您的一个好儿子。”
    这就是我和来自中国的父亲第一次相逢时所想起的。亲爱的父亲！亲爱的志愿军哥哥们！敬爱的毛主席！我永远都在感激你们，决心永远作一个你们的好儿子、好兄弟，同时作一个献身于和平事业的好战士。
    按：崔?是在一九五二年一月被不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教舍身从冰冻的河里抢救出来的朝鲜少年。罗盛教牺牲后，崔?就写信给罗盛教的父亲罗迭开，要求罗迭开把他当作自己儿子一样看待。今年十月下旬，崔?和崔?的父亲崔鼎汉（前译崔正万）在平壤会见了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团团员、罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开。上面这篇文章，是崔?在会见了罗迭开以后写的感想。（新华社）
