    李相朝将军抗议美方严重违反协议的行为
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方军事警察十九日在军事停战委员会总部区共同警卫区强行扣留了三名误入该地区的我方人员。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军为此于二十日致函军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西。该函全文如下：“我在一九五三年十一月二十日一时三十分收到你从联合秘书处转来的通知。一九五三年十一月十九日，我方人员三名误入共同警卫区事件，事实十分清楚，毋庸进行调查。在共同警卫区内，各方应对本方人员的行为负责。你方警卫人员竟将上述三名我方人员强加扣留，经我方一再与你方交涉，仍不退还。这是严重违反协议的行为。我坚决要求你立即交还上述三名我方人员，并要你负责由于你方未立即交还上述三名我方人员而引起的一切后果。”
