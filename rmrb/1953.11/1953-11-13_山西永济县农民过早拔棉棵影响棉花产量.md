In Yongji County, Shanxi Province, some farmers have recently been pulling up cotton plants too early, which is affecting cotton yields. In Lishan, Gaojia, and Yangfeng townships in the county's sixth district, more than 8,300 mu of cotton were planted, of which more than 1,400 mu have been pulled up and planted with wheat. In Dongren Village, farmers Niu Zixi and seven other households planted 44 mu of cotton, and 19 mu have been pulled up. In Yaowen Township in the first district, one-third of the cotton fields have also been pulled up. The cotton plants that have been pulled up have an average of five or six bolls each, and more than half of them could mature in the short term. At present, farmers everywhere are making final efforts to increase the harvest of autumn grain and cotton. Prematurely pulling up cotton plants by some cotton farmers will inevitably reduce the cotton harvest, not only reducing farmers' own income, but also reducing the country's industrial raw materials.

The main reason why farmers are pulling up cotton plants prematurely is that they do not fully understand the significance of the state's cotton purchase in installments. They cannot sell the cotton all at once, so they feel that planting cotton is not as convenient as planting other crops, and therefore they do not pay attention to the cotton harvest. All localities should do a good job of publicizing the significance of the state's cotton purchase in installments to farmers, and dissuade farmers from prematurely pulling up cotton plants. The departments that purchase cotton should also pay attention to making it as convenient as possible for farmers to sell cotton.

    山西永济县农民过早拔棉棵影响棉花产量
    山西永济县最近有些群众把棉棵过早拔掉，以致影响棉花的收成。该县六区历山、高家、阳峰三个乡共种棉花八千三百多亩，已拔掉一千四百多亩种了小麦，东仁自然村农民牛自西等八户种棉四十四亩，已拔掉十九亩，一区姚温乡的棉田也已被拔掉了三分之一。被拔掉的棉花，平均每株都有五、六个桃子，有一半以上在短期内就可以成熟。目前各地农民正作最后努力提高秋粮和棉花的收获量，部分棉农拔棉棵过早，势必降低棉花的收获量，不但农民自己减少了收入，也减少了国家的工业原料。
    农民过早地拔掉棉棵的原因，主要是对国家分期购棉的意义认识不足，不能一下卖掉棉花，就觉得种棉花不如种其他作物方便，因而对棉花的收获就不重视。各地应很好地向农民宣传国家分期购棉的意义，劝止农民过早拔掉棉棵的做法。收购棉花的部门，也应注意尽量照顾农民售棉的方便。
