Unforgettable Meeting

    (I) First Meeting with a Relative

    "Dad, Dad, you've finally come!"

    "Cui Ying, Cui Ying, I've finally seen you today!"

    This was a touching scene. On October 22nd, at the open-air theater in Pyongyang, Cui Ying, the Korean boy who was rescued from the water by Luo Shengjiao at the cost of his life, met Luo Shengjiao's father, Luo Diekai. They embraced each other tightly. How much he had longed for this day! Luo Diekai heard Cui Ying's unfamiliar yet affectionate voice calling him "Dad." Tears welled up in his eyes. In the blur of his tears, he seemed to feel that the one rushing into his arms was his own son, Shengjiao.

    Amidst thunderous applause, another pair of warm, rough peasant hands reached out. Cui Dinghan, Cui Ying's father, a simple Korean old farmer, firmly grasped his hands. Before he could even offer proper greetings, Cui Ying respectfully presented him with a package of gifts—two sets of Korean national costumes and a bolt of homespun silk woven by his mother. Luo Diekai hurriedly took out the gifts he had brought for Cui Ying—a plaster statue of Chairman Mao, a set of blue velvet clothes, a set of underwear, a Hero brand fountain pen, and three notebooks... fully packed in a schoolbag.

    Luo Diekai warmly pulled Cui Ying, and Cui Ying tightly supported Luo Diekai, sitting down beside him.

    "Shengjiao Gege rescued me," Cui Ying had barely said a word when he couldn't contain the excitement in his heart, and hot tears rolled down. "I will never forget Shengjiao Gege and you, Dad. I am determined to be your loyal son in place of Shengjiao Gege."

    Luo Diekai's eyes also moistened. He took Cui Ying's hands and slowly said, "When I came, Shengjiao's mother asked me to tell you to study hard, improve your education, and serve the people wholeheartedly in the future. Shengjiao will be as if he is still alive."

    (II) The Leader's Gratitude

    In the heart of the Korean people—the grand auditorium of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea—the wise leader of the Korean people, Premier Kim Il-sung, raised a glass of wine high, wishing that the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people forged in blood would be further consolidated and developed. Everyone in the hall raised their glasses filled with red wine. At this moment, Luo Shengjiao's father, Luo Diekai, stepped forward and, in the name of the father of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier, proposed a toast to Premier Kim Il-sung. When Premier Kim Il-sung clearly understood that he was Luo Shengjiao's father, he raised his glass and said in Chinese, "Thank you, thank you for giving birth to such a good son who sacrificed for the Korean people, thank you for being such a good father."

    (III) People's Welcome

    The leader's gratitude expressed the gratitude of the people on the three thousand li of land in Korea. In Shuocang Village, Chengguan County, more than a hundred li from Pyongyang, two thousand residents from Luo Shengjiao Village and nearby villages lined up for more than a li from three o'clock in the morning, waiting for the arrival of Luo Shengjiao's father. The young people cleaned more than twenty li of roads, the girls collected fresh flowers from the surrounding mountains, and the old farmers wore black gauze hats. They were all waiting, waiting for the relative they had been longing for day and night—the old farmer from a distant Chinese village, the father who sacrificed his son to save a Korean child. He has arrived, he is getting closer, Cui Ying rushes towards him, wearing a black student uniform, so much like Shengjiao who left his hometown seven years ago; Luo Diekai did not have time to think, he was lifted up by a group of Korean youths, countless flowers were thrown at him, and thousands of pairs of eyes filled with gratitude and love looked at him. "Aba Ji," "Aba Ji," this is the crisp sound of hundreds of children wearing green scarves.

    "Thank you, thank you!" This was an old Korean woman who squeezed up, held his hands, and said with tears of gratitude: "Your child sacrificed for the Korean child, you are the father of the Korean child."

    (IV) Late-Night Heart-to-Heart Talk

    In the evening, at Cui Ying's home. A clean little room, with straw mats on the floor, and a copper-clad cabinet in the corner that was wiped until it shone. On the walls were posters of Luo Shengjiao, photos of Chairman Mao and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and pictures of Chinese and Korean troops fighting side by side. Fresh apples, chestnuts, and mountain pears were placed on the low table. The oil lamp flickered, giving everything a sense of warmth and intimacy. Luo Diekai, Cui Ying, and his parents sat cross-legged on the straw mats, talking as if they were family members who had been separated for a long time. They talked about their mutual concern for each other, about the situation of both families, about this year's harvest and prospects, about plans to strive for a bumper harvest next year, and even about the current situation. At this time, Cui Ying was even less restrained. He lay on the mat, tightly snuggling against Luo Diekai, and naively looked up at him, asking him to tell him about Shengjiao Gege's childhood life and studies.

    "Shengjiao started studying at the age of six." The old man recalled, telling Cui Ying with fatherly love: "I taught him the Three Character Classic. I taught him during the day, and he went out to teach the children in the village at night. He was a child who liked to help people since he was little." Cui Ying looked up at his Chinese Dad, listening quietly while constantly writing in his notebook.

    "At the age of seven or eight, he helped me graze cattle, cut grass, and collect firewood, very diligently. He went to school at the age of ten, and after only half a year in the first grade, he went to the third grade. He studied during the day and helped me graze cattle when he came back at night. He always wrote for a while before going to bed every night. When he was thirteen, I couldn't afford to send him to school, so he helped me with farm work at home. When he was fifteen, my third brother saw that he was good at studying, told me three times, and helped him to be sent to the Provincial Ninth Normal School in Qiancheng County, Xiangxi. After graduating, he went to the Provincial Thirteenth Middle School for two years. In 1950, he joined the Volunteer Army and came to Korea."

    Cui Ying looked up at his Chinese Dad, listening quietly while constantly writing in his notebook, sometimes asking questions. The conversation continued until late at night.

    (V) Luo Shengjiao Never Dies

    Luo Shengjiao sacrificed himself, but his spirit will live forever. The village where Luo Shengjiao sacrificed has been renamed Luo Shengjiao Village, the Lezhi River has been renamed Luo Shengjiao River, and the Fotidong Mountain where he was buried has been renamed Luo Shengjiao Mountain. Luo Shengjiao's name will coexist with these mountains and rivers.

    Since Luo Shengjiao sacrificed himself, the seventeen young people in this village have formed the Luo Shengjiao Production Support Assault Team, completing the spring plowing fifteen days ahead of schedule in 1951, and also helping the families of martyrs and soldiers accumulate fertilizer and cultivate the land. When the country needed horse feed, they hoed the ground during the day, accumulated fertilizer at night, and went up the mountain to cut green grass for horse feed before going to the field in the morning, and also seized rest time to study culture at noon. They became the most outstanding production assault team in Chengguan County. The leader, Li Yingpei, participated in the county and national labor model conferences. The Luo Shengjiao Class was also established at the Sucang People's School where Cui Ying studied. Before its establishment, the average grade of the whole class was three to four points, but this year the average grade of the whole class reached four to five points. Cui Ying had never attended school before, and a teacher specially helped him. In one year, he finished four years of courses, and entered the school in the last year of elementary school—the fifth grade (Korean elementary school is a five-year system). Due to his hard work and the help of his classmates, his grades reached excellent upon graduation. The students of the Luo Shengjiao Class go to Luo Shengjiao's tomb every week to sweep the tomb, read aloud their letters of determination, and report on their study progress. The members of the Luo Shengjiao Production Assault Team gather at the Luo Shengjiao River every early morning to report on the production situation and formulate the day's action plan. They do this so that they will never forget Luo Shengjiao for a moment. When they encounter difficulties, just looking at Luo Shengjiao's tomb increases their courage and determination to overcome difficulties.

    Luo Shengjiao did not die, his spirit will live forever, live in the production activities of the Luo Shengjiao Production Support Assault Team, live in the intensive study of the Luo Shengjiao Class, live in the struggle of thousands of Korean people to defend their motherland and strive for happiness, just like the words personally inscribed by Marshal Kim Il-sung on the Luo Shengjiao monument: "The internationalist spirit of Martyr Luo Shengjiao will forever coexist with the Korean people!"

### 难忘的会见

    难忘的会见
    金凤
    （一）亲人初会
    “爸爸，爸爸，你可来啦！”
    “崔?，崔?，我今天终于看到你了！”
    这是一个动人的场面。十月二十二日，在平壤的露天剧场，被罗盛教从水中舍生救起的朝鲜少年崔?和罗盛教的父亲罗迭开老人见面了，他们紧紧地偎抱在一起。多么渴望着这一天啊，罗迭开老人听到崔?陌生的却是亲热的叫他“爸爸”的声音，泪水夺眶而出了，泪眼模糊中，他仿佛觉得扑向他怀里的就是自己亲生的儿子盛教。
    掌声雷动中，又一双温暖的粗糙的农民的手伸过来。崔?的父亲崔鼎汉，一个朴实的朝鲜老农民，紧紧握住他的双手。在他来不及仔细问候的时候，崔?已恭恭敬敬捧给他一包礼物—两套朝鲜民族服装，一匹他母亲手织的家绢。罗迭开老人急急忙忙拿出他自己带给崔?的礼物—一个毛主席石膏像、一套蓝色毛绒衣裤，一套内衣，一枝金星钢笔，三个日记本，……满满装了一书包。
    罗迭开亲热地拉着崔?，崔?紧紧搀扶着罗迭开，在他的身旁坐下。
    “盛教哥哥把我救出来了”，崔?刚说了一句，已经压不住心头的激动，滚出了热泪。“我一时一刻也不会忘记盛教哥哥和您老，爸爸，我决心替盛教哥哥当您老的忠实儿子。”
    罗迭开老人的眼睛也湿润了，他拉起崔?的双手，慢慢地说：“我来的时候，盛教的妈妈让我嘱咐你，要你好好念书，把文化提高，将来全心全意给人民办事，盛教死了也如活着一般。”
    （二）领袖的感谢
    在朝鲜人民的心脏—朝鲜劳动党中央的大礼堂里，朝鲜人民英明的领袖金日成首相高高举起一杯酒，祝朝中人民以鲜血凝成的友谊更加巩固与发展，全厅的人举起了盛满红色葡萄酒的酒杯。这时候，罗盛教父亲罗迭开走上去，以中国人民志愿军战士父亲的名义，向金日成首相敬酒。当金日成首相问清楚他就是罗盛教的父亲，举起他的酒杯，亲切地用中国话说：“谢谢你，谢谢你生了这样的好儿子为朝鲜人民牺牲了，谢谢你这样的好爸爸。”
    （三）人民的欢迎 领袖的感激表达了朝鲜三千里江山土地上人民的感激。在离平壤一百多里成川郡朔仓里地方，罗盛教村和附近村上两千居民从半夜三点钟起，就排成一里多长的行列等待着罗盛教父亲的到来。青年们打扫了二十多里道路，姑娘们采集了周围山中的鲜花，老年的农民头上戴起了乌纱礼帽。他们都在等待着，等待着他们日夜盼望着的亲人—那个来自遥远中国乡村的老农民，那个献出自己儿子救了朝鲜孩子的父亲。来了，走近了，崔?迎面奔过来，穿着一身黑色的学生装，多么像七年前离开家乡的盛教；罗迭开还来不及细想，就被一群朝鲜青年抬起来了，无数的鲜花投向他，成千双怀着感激和热爱的眼光望着他。“阿爸吉”、“阿爸吉”，这是成百个结着绿色领巾的孩子的清脆的声音。
    “谢谢，谢谢你！”这是一位朝鲜老大娘挤上来，捧住他的双手，流下感激的眼泪在说：“你的孩子为朝鲜孩子牺牲了，你就是朝鲜孩子的父亲。”
    （四）深夜恳谈
    晚上，在崔?的家里。一间洁净的小屋，地上铺着草席，屋角放的铜皮柜被擦拭得发亮。屋壁上张贴着罗盛教的画像，挂着毛主席和金日成元帅的相片，还有中朝军队并肩作战的画片。炕桌上摆着新鲜的苹果、栗子和山梨，油灯光摇曳着，一切都给人一种亲切温暖的感觉，罗迭开老人、崔?和他的父亲母亲盘坐在草席上，好像久别的家人一样谈着话。他们谈互相惦念的心情，谈双方家庭的情形，谈今年的收成和光景，谈明年争取丰收的计划，一直谈到当前的形势。崔?这时更是一点也不拘束了，他伏在席上，紧紧地偎着罗迭开老人，他天真地仰起脸要求给他讲盛教哥哥小时生活和学习的情形。
    “盛教六岁就开始念书。”老人回忆着，带着父亲的慈爱给崔?讲着：“是我教他念三字经。白天我教了他，晚上他就出去教同村的孩子，从小就是个喜欢帮助人的孩子啊。”崔?仰脸望着他的中国爸爸，一面静静听着，一面不断用笔往笔记本上记着。
    “七八岁的时候帮助我放牛、割草、打柴，蛮勤快哩。十岁进学校读书，刚进去读一年级，下半年就读三年级。他白天读书，夜晚回来帮我放牛，每天晚上总要写一会字才睡觉。十三岁的时候我供不起他上学，他就在家里帮我在田间劳动。十五岁的时候我三弟看他书读得好，跟我讲了三次，由他帮助送到湘西干城县省立第九师范读书，毕业以后又进省立十三中高中念了两年。一九五○年就参加志愿军上朝鲜来了。”
    崔?仰脸望着他的中国爸爸，一面静静听着，一面不断在笔记本上记着，有时还提出问题。谈话一直继续到深夜。
    （五）罗盛教不死
    罗盛教牺牲了，他的精神永远活着。罗盛教牺牲的那个地方的村子已经改名罗盛教村，栎治河已改名罗盛教河，安葬他的佛体洞山已改名罗盛教山，罗盛教的名字将与这些山河并存。
    自从罗盛教牺牲以后，这个村上的十七个青年就成立了罗盛教生产支前突击队，比一九五一年提前十五天完成春耕，还帮助烈、军属积肥、种地。国家需要马料，他们白天锄地，晚上积肥，早晨下地以前上山去割青草交马料，中午还抓紧休息时间学习文化。他们成为成川郡最优秀的生产突击队，队长李应培参加了全郡和全国的劳动模范大会。在崔?读书的粟苍人民学校又成立了罗盛教班。没有成立以前全班成绩总平均是三分到四分，今年全班成绩总平均达到了四分到五分。崔?过去没有上过学，有一个教员专门帮助他，在一年中赶完了四年课程，进学校就念小学最后一年—五年级（朝鲜小学是五年制）。由于他的刻苦努力，加上同学们的帮助，毕业时成绩达到优等。罗盛教班的学生，每星期都到罗盛教墓上去清扫墓地，朗读自己的决心书，报告自己的学习情况。罗盛教生产突击队的队员，每天清早集合到罗盛教河边汇报生产情况，订出一天的行动计划。他们这样做，为的是一时一刻也不要忘记罗盛教。当他们遇到困难，只要看一看罗盛教的坟墓，就增加了克服困难的勇气和决心。
    罗盛教没有死，他的精神永远活着，活在罗盛教生产支前突击队的生产活动中，活在罗盛教班的紧张学习中，活在朝鲜千千万万群众为保卫祖国为争取幸福的斗争中，正像金日成元帅在罗盛教碑上亲笔题的字：“罗盛教烈士的国际主义精神与朝鲜人民永远共存！”（附图片）
    十月二十二日，在平壤各界人民欢迎中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团大会上，罗迭开与崔?父子会见。这是慰问团总团长贺龙将军（左起第三人）与他们的合影。（左起第一人为崔?，第二人为罗迭开；右起第一人为崔?的父亲。）　　　　　　解放军画报社刘峰摄
