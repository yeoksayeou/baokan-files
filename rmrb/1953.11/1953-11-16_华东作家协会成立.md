　　Establishment of the East China Writers Association
    The inaugural meeting of the East China Writers Association was held in Shanghai from November 6th to 8th. More than one hundred literary writers, playwrights, critics, and translators from East China and Shanghai attended. The conference discussed and approved the charter of the East China Writers Association, defined the association's tasks, and elected 46 people, including Xia Yan, Yu Ling, Ba Jin, Wang Tongzhao, Song Yunbin, Tang Tao, Zhang Jinyi, Chen Wangdao, Wei Jinzhi, and Luo Jizhi, to form the council of the East China Writers Association.
    Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report to the conference on the current situation and the general line and general task of our country during the transition period, and gave instructions on literary and artistic work. He pointed out: The new literary movement since the "May Fourth" Movement should be correctly analyzed and fully evaluated. The Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers made a clear indication and elaboration on this issue, which will give everyone more confidence in continuing socialist transformation ideologically and more effectively improving in terms of obligations. Comrade Chen Yi pointed out: The national cultural tradition should be analyzed and accepted from the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. One should not have the bias of thinking that the old is all good or all bad. Scientific analysis should be carried out to grasp the spirit of the people, democracy, and love for the country and the people. To be a Chinese writer, one should first be familiar with the history of Chinese literature and study our excellent realistic literary traditions well. He pointed out that writers must work hard to have skilled literary techniques; writers should strive to learn politics and pay attention to their profession at the same time. He called on everyone to create boldly and publish prudently. He encouraged older writers to write more, take on more apprentices, and young writers to learn more from older writers.
    Xia Yan conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers and the Second National Congress of Literary Workers of China at the meeting. The conference held group discussions on the above two reports. Finally, Xia Yan made a summary. He summarized the gains of the conference and called on writers to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study their profession, enrich their lives, and improve their political and artistic levels in order to bear the important and glorious tasks entrusted to literary workers during the national transition period.

    夏衍在会上传达了中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会和中国文学工作者第二次代表大会的精神和决议。对上述两报告，大会曾分组进行了讨论。最后由夏衍作总结。他总结了大会的收获，并号召作家们努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习业务，丰富生活，提高政治和艺术水平，以负担国家过渡时期所赋予文学工作者的重大和光荣的任务。
