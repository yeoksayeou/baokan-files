　　Heartening Good News
　　Famous Yu Opera Actress Chang Xiangyu
    What an encouragement to hear the good news that Kim Il-sung, the most beloved leader of the Korean people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, is leading a Korean government delegation to visit our country! When the good news reached Xi'an, rehearsals in our troupe's rehearsal hall were temporarily suspended, and studies in the classroom were also temporarily suspended. Everyone gathered to listen attentively as a comrade read the relevant news. People's hearts were excited, and the actors proposed to speed up the rehearsal of programs, to present the best programs to welcome Marshal Kim Il-sung. A thirteen-year-old child hurried over and said to me naively, "Let us dance the children's dance we learned from Korea for Grandpa Kim Il-sung!"
    Dear Marshal Kim Il-sung, you are the symbol of happiness and brightness of the heroic Korean people, you are the symbol of peace and victory. We sincerely respect you and warmly welcome your arrival! This spring, I personally went to the beautiful Korea and saw the heroic Korean people. They fought side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers in the tunnels, defeating the crazy invaders; they cultivated the fields and transplanted rice seedlings under the threat of enemy planes, supporting the front lines; now, it is still them who are restoring the wounds of war with selfless labor and rebuilding their homes. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has been forged with blood. I will never forget the warm care the Korean people showed us when we were giving慰问演出 performances in Korea. This April, when our慰问文工团 troupe passed through Ukri, we stayed at the home of a certain Auntie Park. In April in Korea, the weather was still very cold. Auntie Park heated the kang bed for us, making it nice and warm, and let us sit on it. When she learned that we were all actors, she quickly boiled water for us to drink and also treated us to a meal. Before we left, Auntie Park's daughter also danced a famous Korean dance for us—Yangsan-do. As the car was about to leave, Auntie Park held my hand tightly and asked me to tell her when we could return. We couldn't help but shout, "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" They also enthusiastically shouted, "Thank you, Mao Zedong!" I deeply understand that this is not an ordinary thing; this is the profound friendship forged by the Chinese and Korean people with battle and with blood. It symbolizes the power of justice, and it symbolizes the infinitely bright future of all mankind!
    Today, dear Marshal Kim Il-sung, as you visit our country, we—the Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era—welcome you with infinitely joyful and excited hearts! We welcome you with actions to build our strong motherland! We welcome you with practical actions to continue strengthening the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea!

专栏：欢迎金日成元帅和朝鲜政府代表团

　　振奋人心的喜讯
　　豫剧名演员　常香玉
    朝鲜人民最敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友金日成元帅，率领朝鲜政府代表团访问我国的喜讯，是多么令人鼓舞啊！喜讯传到西安时，我们剧社的排演场上暂时停止了排演，教室里也暂时停止了学习，大家都聚精会神地听一位同志朗读着有关的新闻。人们的心在激动着，演员们提议加紧排演节目，要拿最好的节目来欢迎金日成元帅。一个才十三岁的孩子，急忙跑来，天真地对我说：“让我们把从朝鲜学来的儿童舞，跳给金日成伯伯看！”
    亲爱的金日成元帅，您是英雄的朝鲜人民的幸福和光明的象征，您是和平胜利的象征。我们衷心地敬爱您，热烈地欢迎您的到来！今年春天，我曾亲自到了山川秀丽的朝鲜，看到过英雄的朝鲜人民。他们，在坑道里和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，击败了疯狂的侵略者；他们，在敌机的威胁下，耕田插秧，支援了前线；如今，还是他们，以忘我的劳动恢复着战争的创伤，重建自己的家园。中朝两国人民间的友谊，已经用鲜血凝结起来了。我永远也不会忘记我们在朝鲜慰问演出时，朝鲜人民对我们的亲切关怀。今年四月间，我们慰问文工团路过乌克里时，住在一位朴妈妈的家里。四月的朝鲜，天气还很寒冷，朴妈妈把炕给我们烧得暖呼呼的，让我们坐在上边。当她知道我们都是演员时，又连忙给我们烧开水喝，还招待我们吃饭。临别，朴妈妈的女儿还给我们跳了一个有名的朝鲜舞——阳山道。车快开了，朴妈妈紧紧地拉住我的手，要我告诉她几时能够回来。我们都情不自禁地高呼：“金日成元帅万岁！”她们也热情地呼着：“感谢毛泽东！”我深切地理解，这不是一件平常的事情，这是中朝两国人民用战斗，用鲜血凝结成的深厚友谊。它，象征着正义的力量，象征着全人类无限美好的将来！
    今天，亲爱的金日成元帅，当您访问我国的时候，我们——毛泽东时代的中国人民，都以无限愉快和兴奋的心情来欢迎您！用建设我们强大祖国的行动来欢迎您！用继续加强抗美援朝斗争的实际行动来欢迎您！
