Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 13th. Special correspondent Wu Min reports: Observers here point out that behind the U.S. claim to bring the explanatory work for POWs to a complete standstill lies a plot to dismantle the explanatory work and replace it with illegal screening of POWs. This action, which violates the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," is fraught with serious consequences for the armistice.

The illegal screening insisted upon by the U.S. in the name of "voluntary repatriation" hindered the Korean armistice for more than a year. After the Korean and Chinese side made a major effort and proposed a compromise solution on the timing and procedures for repatriating POWs, the interrupted armistice negotiations were resumed. This compromise solution resulted in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The basis of the "Terms of Reference" is to explain to the POWs their right to repatriation while they are in the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This foundation is being gradually destroyed by U.S.-directed secret agents in the custody camps south of the demilitarized zone.

Since November 6th, when Kuomintang secret agents prevented POWs from coming out to listen to explanations in Camp 22, the U.S. Information Service and other U.S. news agencies have been trying to clamor for "completely halting the explanatory work" and using another "system" of individually interrogating POWs.

After the U.S.-directed secret agents in the custody camps interrupted the explanatory work for several weeks, the U.S. plot to completely sabotage the explanatory work and carry out individual interrogations or screenings without the explanation of representatives of the POWs' home countries has recently been exposed.

The obstruction at the beginning of the explanatory work, and the repeated suspensions of the explanatory work in the forty-eight days since the POWs were transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, indicate that the U.S. military authorities are implementing a premeditated plan to force the explanatory work to a standstill. The U.S. has so far refused to conduct explanations to the U.S., British, and South Korean POWs in the custody camps north of the demilitarized zone.

The key point of the gradual plan of Hamblen's anti-repatriation group of psychological warfare experts is to make full use of the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents and their terrorist organizations in the camps to paralyze the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, and forcibly create conditions for sabotaging the explanatory work. The first step was to transfer the terrorist rule of the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents from the U.S. POW camps to the demilitarized zone intact. Then the U.S. obstructed the provision of facilities for the explanatory venues, giving these secret agents time to strengthen their organizations and control over the POWs, while losing about twenty days of the ninety-day explanatory period stipulated in the "Terms of Reference."

During this period, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents flaunted their force by carrying out anti-Indian demonstrations and threatening "mass escapes." The U.S. made a great deal of publicity about this, and Syngman Rhee threatened to use force to support this activity. This show of force against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force prepared the ground for the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to oppose the use of force against these secret agents on the pretext of "heavy casualties" and "mass escapes."

The next step in the U.S. plan was for the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents to take turns in bringing the explanatory work to a standstill. On the first day of the explanatory work, October 15th, the Kuomintang secret agent leaders in all the camps made demands before agreeing to let the POWs come out to listen to the explanations. One of the demands was that the POWs who came out to listen to the explanations had to return to their original camps. This was in violation of the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Visits" adopted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which stipulated that POWs who had listened to the explanations in one camp should be separated from POWs who had not listened to the explanations.

The next day, the Syngman Rhee secret agents used the same tactics to prevent the POWs from coming out, bringing the explanatory work to a standstill. They also made many demands before agreeing to let the POWs come out to listen to the explanations. One of the demands was that the secret agents had freedom of movement between the camps. Due to this stalemate, about two weeks of the ninety-day period were lost.

The Kuomintang secret agents in Camp 22 then prevented the POWs from coming out, causing the current stalemate to last for more than a week. This time, one of their demands was that the time for individual explanations should be limited. They demanded that explanations be completed to about 500 POWs in one camp in one day, which means that an average of about half an hour of explanation would be given to each POW. And in this half hour, the explanatory work was interrupted by the disruption of the secret agents, the U.S. observer representatives and translators, and the Swiss and Swedish representatives of the auxiliary organs, and most of the time was wasted, so that individual explanations became nominal.

Observers here clearly see that the purpose of the U.S. plan to force the explanatory work to a complete standstill is also to discredit the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force in front of the world. The Swiss and Swedish representatives threatened to withdraw from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission if force was used against the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents who have been using intimidation and terror to deal with POWs who wish to be repatriated. Their threat enabled these secret agents to sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and tear up the "Terms of Reference."

So far, only the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have insisted on taking strong measures, including the use of force, to break the coercion and terror rule of these secret agents and give the POWs freedom so that they can exercise their right to be repatriated. The repeated long-term suspensions of the explanatory work have once again proved that this is the only way the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can take to prevent the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents from completely sabotaging the explanatory work and fulfilling the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." The successful investigation conducted by the Indian Custodial Force in Camp 28 on November 2nd proves that this can be done.

### 美方彻底破坏解释工作的阴谋已完全暴露  企图以对战俘进行非法甄别代替解释工作

    美方彻底破坏解释工作的阴谋已完全暴露
    企图以对战俘进行非法甄别代替解释工作
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：这里的观察家指出：在美国扬言要使对战俘进行的解释工作陷于完全停顿的背后，有着要使解释工作瓦解而代之以对战俘进行非法甄别的阴谋。这种撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的行动，充满了对停战的严重后果。
    美国以“自愿遣返”的名义所坚持的非法甄别，曾阻碍了朝鲜的停战一年多。在朝中方面作了一次重大的努力，对遣返战俘的时间和程序提出了一项折衷解决办法以后，中断了的停战谈判才得以恢复。这种折衷的解决办法结果产生了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。“职权范围”的基础，就是当战俘们在由中立国遣返委员会看管时，向战俘们解释他们遣返的权利。这种基础正在被非军事区南部看管营场中的美国所指使的特务逐步地摧毁。
    自从十一月六日国民党特务在第二十二号营场中阻止战俘出来听取解释以后，美国新闻处和其他的美国通讯社竭力扬言要“使解释工作完全停顿”，并使用另一套个别讯问战俘的“制度”。
    在看管营场中的美国指使的特务中断了若干星期的解释工作以后，最近暴露了美国要想完全破坏解释工作并不经战俘所属国家代表的解释而实行个别讯问或甄别的阴谋。
    在解释工作开始时的阻挠，以及在战俘被移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以来的四十八天中，解释工作的一再停顿，表示美国军事当局正在执行一项迫使解释工作陷于停顿的预谋计划。美方迄今拒绝对非军事区北部看管营场中的美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘进行解释。
    汉布伦的反对遣返组的心理战专家们的逐步计划的要点，就是充分利用国民党和李承晚特务以及他们在营房中的恐怖组织，来瘫痪中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的工作，强行造成破坏解释工作的条件。第一步就是把国民党和李承晚的特务的恐怖统治原封不动地由美国战俘营转移到非军事区。然后美国在提供解释场所的设备这方面作梗，使这些特务有时间来加强他们的组织和对战俘的控制，同时使“职权范围”所规定的九十天解释期间失去了约二十天。
    在这段时期中，国民党和李承晚的特务以进行反印度示威和扬言“大批逃跑”炫示了武力。美方对此大肆宣传，李承晚则扬言要使用武力来支持这种活动。对付中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的这种武力的炫示，为中立国遣返委员会的瑞士和瑞典委员藉口“重大伤亡”和“大批逃跑”而反对对这些特务使用武力准备了基础。
    美国计划的下一个步骤，就是要国民党特务和李承晚特务轮流地使解释工作陷于停顿。在进行解释工作的头一天，即十月十五日，所有营场的国民党特务头子们曾提出了要求，然后才同意让战俘出来听取解释。其中一个要求是：出来听解释的战俘，得回到原来的营场。这是违反中立国遣返委员会所通过的“解释和访问工作细则”的，“工作细则”规定：应当把一个营场中听过解释的战俘与没有听过解释的战俘隔离开来。
    第二天，李承晚特务使用了同样的手段，不让战俘出来，使解释工作陷于停顿。他们也提出了许多要求，然后才同意让战俘出来听取解释。其中一个要求是：特务在各营场之间有行动的自由。由于这种僵局，九十天期间失去了约两个星期的时间。
    第二十二号营场的国民党特务接着也不让战俘出来，使目前的僵局持续了一个多星期。这次，他们提出的要求之一是：对个人解释的时间要加以限制。他们要求一天向一个营场的约五百名战俘解释完毕，这就是说，平均对一个战俘进行约半小时的解释。而在这半小时中，由于解释帐篷中的特务、美方观察代表和翻译以及附属机构的瑞士和瑞典代表的捣乱而使解释工作中断下来，多半的时间是白费了，以致个别解释成为有名无实。
    这里的观察家看得很清楚：美国迫使解释工作完全停顿的计划，其目的也是在使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在世界面前威信扫地。瑞士和瑞典代表曾威胁说，如果对那些一直在用恐吓和恐怖手段来对付希望遣返的战俘的国民党特务和李承晚特务使用武力，他们就退出中立国遣返委员会。他们的这种威胁使这些特务能够破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作并撕毁“职权范围”。
    迄今只有中立国遣返委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表坚持主张采取强有力的措施，包括使用武力，来打破这些特务的胁迫和恐怖统治并使战俘得到自由，以便他们能行使他们被遣返的权利。解释工作一再陷于长期停顿，这再度证明，这是中立国遣返委员会所能采取的唯一办法，来阻止国民党特务和李承晚特务完全破坏解释工作，并且履行“职权范围”的规定。印度看管部队十一月二日在第二十八号营场顺利进行的调查，证明这是能够做到的。
