    Soviet Party and Government Leaders Malenkov and Others Attend
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th] According to TASS Moscow: The All-Union Food Industry Conference, which opened in Moscow on October 31st, closed on the 3rd.
    G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, A.I. Mikoyan, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and N.A. Mikhailov, Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attended the conference.
    The conference heard and discussed the report by V. Zotov, Minister of the Food Industry of the USSR, on the further development of the food industry, increasing the variety of food products, and improving their quality.
    In his report, Zotov spoke about the tasks facing the food industry to rapidly increase food production, improve food quality, and increase the variety of food products. He also spoke in detail about the measures that could guarantee the implementation of the resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on "Expanding Food Production and Improving Food Quality," as well as the detailed plans for building modern enterprises and automating and mechanizing production processes in various sectors of the food industry in the next two or three years. Zotov also pointed out the shortcomings in certain sectors of the food industry, the underutilization of equipment, and the untapped potential of many enterprises. He said that the responsibility of all staff in the food industry is to eliminate shortcomings, mobilize all forces to complete and overfulfill the plans to greatly increase food production, and unswervingly strive to improve quality and ensure the production of abundant high-quality food in our country in the coming years.
    Fifty-nine people spoke in the discussion. They pointed out that the workers, engineers, technicians, and other personnel of the Soviet food industry, like all Soviet people, warmly welcomed the resolutions of the Communist Party and the government. They demonstrated a high degree of political enthusiasm and enthusiastically worked to realize the grand program of further increasing food production and improving food quality. Workers in various factories are doing their best to provide residents with more butter, sugar, and other food products. A socialist competition has been launched nationwide to strive to complete tasks ahead of schedule and overproduce products, so as to meet the requirements of the people according to their preferences and their increasing needs. They also put forward proposals on the automation and mechanization of the production process to expand the production capacity of existing enterprises.
    Those who spoke in the discussion said that food industry enterprises have great potential to implement production plans, but to implement the plans, it is first necessary to ensure the normal work of the enterprises, more effectively utilize equipment, summarize the working methods of advanced workers and promote them.
    Participants in the conference put forward many rationalization proposals to increase food production, improve food quality and packaging, increase food variety, and valuable suggestions on improving labor organization and improving cadre training and advanced studies to increase labor productivity. They also criticized the construction agencies, timber, paper, steel, and other industries that did not pay sufficient attention to the urgent needs of the food industry and did not provide the necessary assistance to enable the food industry to complete its tasks.
    In his concluding remarks, Zotov summarized the work of the conference and emphasized that the measures currently prescribed to increase food production and improve food quality are only the beginning of the great efforts that food industry workers must make. It is necessary to more boldly expose shortcomings, eliminate shortcomings, utilize all production potential, and continuously increase the production of food for the Soviet people. Zotov expressed his belief that food industry workers will gloriously complete the tasks before them and will contribute to the great cause of the communist construction of our motherland.

    全苏食品工业会议胜利闭幕
    苏联党和政府领袖马林科夫等出席
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月三十一日在莫斯科开幕的全苏食品工业会议，已在三日闭幕。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫，苏联共产党中央委员会书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，苏联部长会议副主席阿·伊·米高扬，苏联共产党莫斯科委员会书记纳·阿·米哈伊洛夫曾参加了会议。
    会议听取并讨论了苏联食品工业部部长瓦·佐托夫所作的关于进一步发展食品工业、增加食品种类并改进其质量的报告。
    佐托夫在报告中谈到了食品工业面临的迅速增加食品产量、改进食品质量和增加食品种类的任务。他也详细地谈到了可以保证苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于“扩大食品生产和改进食品质量”的决议得到执行的措施，以及今后两三年中在食品工业各部门中兴建现代化的企业和使生产过程自动化和机械化的详尽的计划。佐托夫还指出了某些食品工业部门中的缺点，设备未能充分利用的情况，以及许多企业有尚未加以发掘的潜力。他说，食品工业全体工作人员的责任是：消灭缺点，动员一切力量来完成和超额完成大大提高食品产量的计划，不屈不挠地努力改进质量并保证在今后几年内在我国生产丰富的上等食品。
    在讨论中发言的有五十九人。他们指出，苏联食品工业的工人、工程师、技术人员及其他的人员和全体苏维埃人民一样，热烈地欢迎共产党和政府的决议，他们表现了高度的政治积极性，并热情地为实现进一步增加食品产量和改进食品质量的宏伟纲领而努力。各工厂的工人们正在尽力供给居民以更多的牛油、食糖和其他食品。全国已展开了争取提前完成任务和超额生产产品的社会主义竞赛。以根据人民的爱好和他们日益增长的需求量，来满足人民的要求。他们还提出了关于生产过程的自动化和机械化以扩大现有企业的生产能力。
    在讨论中发言的人说，食品工业企业有巨大的潜力来实行生产计划，然而要实行计划，首先必需保证各企业的正常工作，更加有效地利用设备，总结先进工人的工作方法并且加以推广。
    参加会议的人提出了许多合理化建议，借以增加食品产量、改进食品质量和包装、增加食品种类，关于改进劳动组织及改进干部训练和进修工作以提高劳动生产率的宝贵建议。他们还批评了那些没有充分注意食品工业迫切的需要而且没有给予必要的帮助来使食品工业完成其任务的建筑机关，木材、造纸、钢铁等工业的工作者。
    佐托夫在最后的发言中总结了会议的工作，并着重指出：目前所规定的增加食品产量和提高食品质量的措施，只是食品工业工人必须作的巨大努力的开端。必须更大胆地揭发缺点，消灭缺点，利用一切生产潜力，不断为苏维埃人民增加食品的产量。佐托夫表示，他相信食品工业工人将光荣地完成他们面前的任务，将对我们祖国的共产主义建设的伟大事业作出贡献。
