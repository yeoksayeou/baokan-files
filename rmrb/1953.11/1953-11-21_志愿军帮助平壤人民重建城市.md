Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th: A certain engineering unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has achieved excellent results in helping to rebuild the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pyongyang.

As soon as the Korean War ceased, this engineering unit was ordered to move from the front line to Pyongyang to assist the Korean people in their reconstruction efforts. In the past three months, they have successfully completed the construction of 580 frames (eight rooms each) for worker, staff, and citizen dormitories, and the rush production of 4,000 door frames. These dormitories are distributed in various streets and neighborhoods of the city, providing housing for a total of 2,060 families. In addition to bedrooms, each dormitory has a kitchen, and some even have dining rooms and living rooms, which are still under construction. They also joined forces with Korean engineering personnel to repair the office buildings of central government organs such as the Cabinet and the Ministry of Trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs building is also under construction. Together with Korean engineers, they also built seven brick kilns for the state-owned Daesong and Gangnam brick factories in Korea, which have now begun production. They also rebuilt five severely damaged three-story buildings in their own garrison, four of which have been completed and one is nearing completion, and built 40 spacious new dormitories.

Commanders and fighters of this engineering unit generally believe that participating in the reconstruction of Pyongyang is as glorious as building Beijing, the motherland's capital. They demonstrated a high degree of internationalist labor enthusiasm in the construction process and tried their best to save resources for the Korean people. In the construction work, each company set up blacksmith furnaces and used scrap iron to make a large number of tools. The 9th Company of the unit collected more than 40,000 kilograms of scrap iron and made a total of 3,890 woodworking, ironworking, and masonry tools, as well as grass cutting knives. The soldiers dug out every usable brick and tile from the ground and put it to use. Cadres and soldiers of the engineering unit also worked hard to study technology and improve their technical level in their work, and their work efficiency generally increased by two to three times compared to the beginning.

During the construction period, this unit received cordial visits from the leaders of the Korean central Party and government organs and people from all walks of life in Pyongyang. Old people put rice cakes in the soldiers' hands, women rushed to wash the soldiers' clothes, literary and art representatives brought hot tea to the soldiers' mouths, and the Daesong Brick Factory named a kiln built by this unit as the "Volunteer Army Kiln" to commemorate the achievements of the Volunteer Army engineering unit.

Currently, this engineering unit is actively planning to restore the buildings of the Pyongyang Medical University Affiliated Hospital and other buildings. The unit responsible for constructing the buildings of the Pyongyang Medical University Affiliated Hospital has entered the work area to clear rubble and fill bomb craters. It is expected that this large-scale hospital will restore its original magnificent appearance between next summer and autumn.

    志愿军帮助平壤人民重建城市
    【新华社平壤二十日电】中国人民志愿军某工兵部队在帮助重建朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤市的工作中，取得了良好的成绩。
    朝鲜战争刚一停止，这支工兵部队就奉命从前线开赴平壤市，帮助朝鲜人民进行重建工作。在最近三个月中，他们胜利地完成了五百八十栋（每栋八间）工人、职员、市民宿舍的房架和四千副房门的赶制工程。这些宿舍分布在市内各街各里，共可供二千零六十户人家居住。每座宿舍除寝室外，还附有厨房，有的还设有饭堂和客厅，现在正在继续修建中。他们又和朝鲜工程人员联合修复了内阁、贸易省等中央机关的办公大楼，外务省的大厦也正在施工修建中。他们并和朝鲜工程人员一道为朝鲜国营的大城、江南两个窑厂修建了七座砖窑，这些砖窑现已开始生产。他们还在自己驻地重修五栋遭到严重破坏的三层楼房，其中四栋已经完工，一栋也接近完工，并新建了四十栋宽敞的宿舍。
    这支工兵部队的指挥员、战斗员普遍认为参加平壤市的重建工作和建设祖国的北京一样光荣。他们在修建工程中，发扬了国际主义的高度劳动热情，并且尽量为朝鲜人民节约资财。在修建工作中，各个连队都设置了铁匠炉，利用废铁制造了大批工具。该部第九连拾了四万多斤废铁，制造了木工、铁工、泥工用的工具和割草刀等共三千八百九十多件。战士们把每一块可用的砖瓦从地里挖出来应用。工兵部队的干部和战士还刻苦钻研技术，在工作中提高了技术水平，工作效率比开始时普遍提高了两倍到三倍。
    这支部队在施工期间，曾受到朝鲜中央党政机关首长和平壤市各界人民亲切的慰问。老人们把打糕放到战士们手里，妇女们抢着为战士们洗衣服，文艺界代表把热茶送到战士们的嘴边，大城窑厂把这支部队修建的一座窑命名为“志愿军窑”，以纪念志愿军工兵部队的功绩。
    现在，这支工兵部队正积极筹划恢复平壤医科大学附属医院的建筑物和其他建筑物。担任修建平壤医科大学附属医院建筑物的部队，已进入工区清理废墟、填平弹坑。预计明年夏秋之间，这所规模宏大的医院将恢复它原来的壮丽面貌。
