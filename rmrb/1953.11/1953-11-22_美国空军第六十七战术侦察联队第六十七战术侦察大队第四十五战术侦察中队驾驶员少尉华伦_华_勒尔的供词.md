    My name is Warren Walker Lear. Before being captured, I was a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-2223287, aged twenty-three. On December 29, 1950, I joined the Air Force as a soldier in Indianapolis, Indiana. I arrived in Korea on August 2, 1952, and was immediately assigned to the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing as an F-51 aircraft pilot. On November 6, 1952, I was transferred to the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. On December 27, 1952, I was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over the Korean central front. I was forced to land on a highway about five miles from the front line, and was captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers about ten minutes later.
    During my inspection and training at K-46 base, I attended several training lectures given by Lieutenant Robert Taylor. One of these lectures, given around August 15, 1952, was specifically about germ warfare. This lesson was held in the classroom of the group training section. Captain Sheffer and seven other pilots who were undergoing combat inspection training also attended.
    Lieutenant Taylor told us that there were several types of germ bombs used in Korea, but only one was relevant to us, namely, oil tanks containing bacterial liquid, which could be used in two ways: dropping or spraying. He also told us about another type of germ bomb, consisting of many small compartments containing germ-carrying insects, the main difference between this and the one we were to use being that this bomb contained insects.
    Lieutenant Taylor told us that the diseases these germs could cause were: typhus, meningitis, malaria, and other diseases that I can't remember.
    Next, Lieutenant Taylor described the oil tank. The oil tank had two inverted "V" shaped loops on top. When the oil tank was hung on the aircraft, these two loops hooked onto the two hooks that formed part of the bomb rack under the wing. When the bomb release button at the top of the control stick was pressed, the oil tank was dropped.
    Lieutenant Taylor went on to talk about the procedure we used to fly to the target area during training missions. He said that since the flight procedure for spraying and dropping oil tanks was similar, we only practiced dropping them during training. This lecture then ended.
    Around August 21, 1952, I was assigned to a training mission. A total of four aircraft participated. During this mission, we carried two oil tanks filled with water. We each took off, circled the base, and assembled. We flew over the target area in a right-hand turn. When the nose of the aircraft reached above the target, I pressed the bomb release button at the top of the control stick. After we dropped the oil tanks, we flew back to the base.
    On the evening of October 9, 1952, I went to the squadron operations room to check the flight time bulletin board and found that I was assigned to the four-man team for the next morning, flying in the second position. The next morning at 9:00 a.m., our team reported to the group briefing room to receive the briefing for this mission.
    The first officer to give us the briefing was the group operations officer, who said, "Mission 1808, germ warfare mission, the ordnance you are carrying is oil tanks filled with liquid bacteria." He then specified that our target was a location with about fifteen thatched huts, located about twenty-five miles west of Haeju. He said in the briefing that this target was a troop concentration area and supply area. Next, the weather officer gave a briefing, informing us that the weather was clear. The final briefing officer was a group intelligence officer. He pointed out our target on the map and gave us the usual intelligence briefing on escape and evasion methods.
    After the briefing, our team leader took the team to the squadron briefing room and explained the procedures we would use on this mission. All of this was routine except for the precautions applicable to germ warfare missions. He said that if any malfunctions occurred during the mission, we should try to drop the oil tank in the drop zone five miles south of the base if possible. If we experienced a malfunction before crossing the bomb line, we would fly back and drop the oil tank in the drop zone before landing. If we encountered a malfunction after crossing the bomb line, we would drop the oil tanks together and then fly back and land. He said that under no circumstances should we land with the oil tanks.
    After the briefing, we took off at 10:30 a.m. We began to descend one mile west of the target. The team leader radioed, "Drop now..." We dropped the bacterial oil tanks and began to ascend. When we reached 9,000 feet, we reformed into combat formation and entered the route back to base. After landing, the team gathered again in the group debriefing room, where the group intelligence officer presided over our debriefing.
    After this flight, I flew three more germ warfare missions. The time of my second germ warfare mission was around October 15th. The time of this mission, like the others, was during the day, around noon. This time our team's target was a cluster of thatched huts about twenty-five to thirty miles southwest of Haeju, which was also a troop concentration area and supply area. This village was located next to an east-west highway.
    My third germ warfare mission was on October 20th. Our team's target was located about five miles east of the target of the second mission. The terrain in this area was mountainous.
    My last germ warfare mission was around October 26th. This time our team's target was a village next to a northeast-southwest highway. We attacked it from the northeast. This village was located about thirty to forty miles northeast of Haeju.
    I flew a total of four germ warfare missions with the 18th Group, each time dropping two oil tanks filled with liquid bacteria. The procedure followed in all four germ warfare missions was the same.
    In general, the pilots rarely discussed their germ warfare missions from a moral point of view. Even if it wasn't the majority, at least some people recognized how cruel and inhumane germ weapons were, and of course, they felt horrified at the thought of these weapons being used against their own families. However, for most pilots, the war and the consequences of using such weapons were impersonal. They couldn't see the consequences of the crimes they were committing. It was only after I was captured and had the opportunity to see the Chinese and Korean people with my own eyes that I began to realize the seriousness and consequences of this inhumane tactic. I deeply regret my participation in germ warfare and certainly hope that this weapon and all similar weapons are banned. Now I realize that I can never erase from my memory the crimes I committed against the Chinese and Korean people in Korea.

    美国空军第六十七战术侦察联队第六十七战术侦察大队第四十五战术侦察中队驾驶员少尉华伦·华·勒尔的供词
    我的名字是华伦·华尔克·勒尔。被俘前，我是美国空军的一个少尉，军号AO—2223287，二十三岁。一九五○年十二月二十九日，我在印第安纳州印第安纳波里斯城参加空军当一名士兵。我于一九五二年八月二日抵朝鲜，当即被指派到第十八战斗轰炸机联队第十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十七战斗轰炸机中队当F —51型飞机驾驶员。一九五二年十一月六日我被调往第六十七战术侦察大队第四十五战术侦察中队。一九五二年十二月二十七日，我在朝鲜中线为高射炮火击落。我被迫降落于离前线约五英里的一条公路上，约十分钟后，为中国人民志愿军所俘获。
    我在K —46基地受检查训练的过程中，听了罗伯特·泰勒中尉的几堂训练讲课，其中约于一九五二年八月十五日讲的一次，是专门关于细菌战的讲课。这堂课是在大队训练科的教室内上的。听课的还有正在参加战斗检查训练的席菲尔上尉和其他七名驾驶员。
    泰勒中尉告诉我们在朝鲜使用的细菌弹有好几种，但与我们有关的只有一种，即内贮细菌液体的油箱，它有两种使用方法：投掷或喷射。他还告诉了我们另一种细菌弹，是由许多小格子构成，内贮带菌昆虫，它和我们要用的那种的主要不同处在于这种弹内贮有昆虫。
    泰勒中尉告诉我们，这些细菌所能引起的疾病是：斑疹伤寒、脑膜炎、疟疾和其它我已记不起来的疾病。
    接着，泰勒中尉描述了油箱。油箱顶上有两个倒“V”字形的圈。油箱挂在飞机上时，这两个圈钩住构成机翼下投弹器之一部分的两个钩子。按下操纵杆顶端的投弹钮时，油箱便投掷下去了。
    泰勒中尉继续谈及我们在训练任务中驶向靶场所使用的程序。他说，由于喷射与投掷油箱的飞行程序是相似的，在训练中我们只实习投掷。这次讲课至此结束。
    约于一九五二年八月二十一日我被排入训练任务。共有四架飞机参加。在这次任务中，我们携带二个贮了水的油箱。我们各自起飞，在基地飞绕一圈，并集合起来。我们在靶场上按向右转的方式飞行。当飞机头部飞达目标上空时，我按下操纵杆顶端的投弹钮。我们把油箱投掷后，飞回基地。
    一九五二年十月九日晚，我到中队作战室去查对一下飞行时间布告板，发现我被排入第二天早晨的四人小队内，飞行第二个位置。翌晨九时，我们小队向大队简令室报到，去接受此任务的简令。
    第一个给予我们简令的军官是大队作战官，他说：“任务一八○八，细菌战任务，你们所携带的军火是贮有液体的细菌油箱。”他接着指定我们的目标是位于海州以西约二十五英里的约有十五间茅屋的所在处。他在简令中说，这一目标是一个部队集中区和供应区。其次，是由气象官发布简令，他告知天气晴朗。最后的简令官是一个大队情报官。他又在地图上把我们的目标指出来，并授予我们关于逃走与闪避方法的例行情报简令。
    简令结束后，我们的小队长把小队带到中队简令室，说明了我们在这次任务中要采用的程序。所有这些，除了为细菌战任务所适用的注意事项外，都是例行的说明。他说，如果在任务中发生任何故障，我们应尽可能试将油箱投掷于基地以南五英里的投掷区内。如果我们在飞越轰炸线前发生了故障，就得飞回并在降落前把油箱投落于投掷区内。如果我们在飞越轰炸线后遇到了故障，便把油箱一起掷掉，然后飞回与降落。他说，在任何情况下，我们决不能带回油箱降落。
    简令结束后，我们于十时三十分起飞，我们在距离目标以西一英里时，开始下降，小队长用无线电指示：“现在投掷……”，我们投掷了细菌油箱，即开始上升。当我们飞达九千英尺时，便重新编成战斗队形，进入飞回基地的航线。降落后，小队又集合在大队汇报室内，大队情报官主持我们的汇报。
    我在这次飞行以后，又执行了三次细菌战任务，我的第二次细菌战任务约在十月十五日。这次任务的时间犹如其他任务一样，仍在白天，大约在中午。我们小队这回的目标是位于海州西南约二十五至三十英里的一丛茅屋处，这也是一个部队集中区与供应区。这个村庄位于一条自东向西的公路旁。
    我的第三次细菌战任务是在十月二十日。我们小队的目标是位于第二次任务的目标以东约五英里处。该地区的地形是多山。
    我最后一次细菌战任务约在十月二十六日。我们小队这回的目标是一条自东北向西南的公路旁的一个村庄。我们从东北方向向它袭击，这村庄位于海州东北约三十至四十英里处。
    我在第十八大队共执行了四次细菌战任务，每次投掷两只贮有液体的细菌油箱。所有四次细菌战任务中所进行的程序是一样的。
    一般说来，驾驶员们很少从道德的观点出发谈论他们的细菌战任务。即使并不是多数，但至少有一些人也认识到细菌武器是一种多么残忍与不人道的武器，一想到这种武器如果被用来对付他们自己的家庭，当然觉得可怕。然而对于大多数的驾驶员来说，战争以及使用这种武器的后果，乃是一种与个人无关的事。他们是看不到他们所犯罪行的后果的。只有在我被俘并有机会亲眼看到中朝人民之后，我才开始意识这种不人道的战术的严重性及其后果。对于我参加了细菌战一事，我深感遗憾，并肯定地希望这种武器与一切类似的武器被禁止使用。现在我认识到我永远不能从我的记忆中拭去我在朝鲜对中朝人民所犯下的罪行。华伦·华·勒尔（签名）美国空军少尉军号AO—2223287第六十七战术侦察大队第四十五战术侦察中队一九五三年一月二十五日（新华社）（附图片）
