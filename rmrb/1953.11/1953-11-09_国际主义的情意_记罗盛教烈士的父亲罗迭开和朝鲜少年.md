    Internationalist Sentiment
    —Remembering Luo Diekai, Father of Martyr Luo Shengjiao, and the Meeting with Korean Boy, Choi ?
    Qǐ Guāng
    On October 29th, Luo Diekai, father of the internationalist warrior Luo Shengjiao and a member of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, along with some delegation members, set off by car towards Shuocang Village in Chengchuan County.
    Shuocang Village is an ordinary mountain village in Korea. The remains of Luo Shengjiao, the glorious son of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people—the immortal internationalist warrior—are buried here.
    The car turned a mountain corner, and Shuocang Village came into view.
    A large group of Korean people dressed in snow-white festive attire were standing here. They had been waiting here for seven hours to welcome the delegation. Representatives of the delegation helped old Mr. Luo Diekai out of the car. Choi ? ran up and embraced Luo Diekai, only managing to say one sentence after a long while: "Papa! You've finally come!"
    "Yes! I've come to see you and the elders in your village!" Luo Diekai gently stroked Choi ?'s head. Choi ?'s father, Choi Dinghan (previously translated as Choi Jung-man), also came up, holding Luo Diekai's hand for a long time and bowing deeply. At this moment, the welcoming crowd raised the Chinese and Korean national flags high, their red light illuminating the faces of everyone.
    Choi ?, Choi Dinghan, and the male and female members of the "Luo Shengjiao Production Brigade" lifted Luo Diekai up and walked towards the village. People cheered, children ran up to present flowers, and old people crowded around to shake hands. People were laughing, dancing…
    Choi ? and Choi Dinghan helped Luo Diekai across the Luo Shengjiao River, along a flat gravel path, towards Luo Shengjiao Mountain. Passing through two archways made of pine branches, a magnificent, bright red pavilion came into view. On a large plaque on the front of the pavilion were written the four characters "万古流芳" [wàn gǔ liú fāng] (Fragrant Forever). Choi ? told Luo Diekai: "This is Brother Shengjiao's memorial pavilion!"
    Turning right along the gravel path, they reached the burial site of Martyr Luo Shengjiao. A tall tombstone stood in front of the tomb, inscribed with a dedication by Premier Kim Il-sung. The tomb was surrounded by stone railings. Members of the delegation paid their respects at the tomb of Martyr Luo Shengjiao.
    That afternoon, the people of Shuocang Village held a grand welcome meeting by the Luo Shengjiao River. At the meeting, Luo Diekai told the villagers of Shuocang what was in his heart. He said: "When I was at home, I thought about it day and night, always wanting to come to Korea to see Shengjiao's comrades-in-arms, to see Shengjiao's younger brother, Choi ?, and his parents, and also to see all of you, my friends in the village, and Premier Kim Il-sung. Today I have finally seen you all, and I am extremely excited. Although my son Shengjiao sacrificed himself, his wishes have been initially realized, and we have defeated the enemy and achieved victory."
    In the evening, Luo Diekai came to Choi ?'s home and sat down with Choi ? and his parents to chat about everyday life. Luo Diekai told Choi ?: "Your Chinese mother, brothers, and sisters are all in good health and miss you very much. This year, we harvested several thousand *jin* of grain at home and are raising four cows and two pigs. Life is good. Your second sister and second brother are both in school and doing very well." Then, Luo Diekai asked about Choi ?'s family's living situation. Choi ? said: "Our family has enough grain to eat this year. My two younger brothers and I are all studying at school. I am now in the first year of junior high school. I really want to go to China with you to see my Chinese mother, brothers, and sisters, but I am too busy with my studies at school to leave. I will definitely go in the future."
    Luo Diekai smiled. He gestured with his hand and said: "Go when you have time! But you can't neglect your studies. While you are studying at school, you must also learn from your Brother Shengjiao when he was young and never rest until you have finished your homework."
    Choi Dinghan kept putting fruit and chestnuts in front of Luo Diekai. The two old men then chatted cordially. Choi Dinghan said: "Originally, I should have taken Choi ? to China to see you, but this time you have come all the way here. I really feel bad about it. Mr. Luo, Choi ? is just like your own son, and he will become a useful person." Luo Diekai said excitedly: "Yes, I am very satisfied to have met Choi ?. With Chairman Mao and Premier Kim Il-sung, we have all become fortunate people!"
    The family chatted until late at night.
    That night, Choi ? served Luo Diekai, who rested at his home. He lay down next to old Mr. Luo.
    The next morning, Choi ? again helped Luo Diekai to the burial site of Martyr Luo Shengjiao. Luo Diekai looked at the scenery around his son's tomb for a long time. At this time, the sun had just risen, and Luo Shengjiao Mountain was full of red maple leaves. The water of the Luo Shengjiao River was flowing quietly, and the surrounding brown fields had just been harvested, just like in China.
    The old man turned to look at Choi ?, then took out a full-body photo of Luo Shengjiao that he had sent him before his sacrifice, and wrote on the back of the photo: "I am giving you this photo of Shengjiao, hoping that you will continue to fight to the end!" Choi ? respectfully took the photo and bowed deeply.
    After breakfast, the comrades of the delegation went to Choi ?'s home to express their condolences. Luo Diekai and Choi ?, along with Choi ?'s parents, took a photo together to keep as a permanent memento.
    When the delegation left Shuocang Village, the entire village saw them off for a long stretch. Choi ? and his father were even more reluctant to let Luo Diekai leave. The father and son sat in a car with Luo Diekai and accompanied him for more than ten kilometers. They constantly exhorted Luo Diekai: "Take care of your health! Write when you get home!" Although the comrades of the delegation and Luo Diekai repeatedly tried to dissuade them, they insisted on seeing him off. It wasn't until the third time the car stopped that everyone persuaded Choi ? and his father to stop. After getting out of the car, Choi ? broke free from the arms of the people and held onto the car window, looking at old Mr. Luo with reluctance.
    "Work hard, child," Luo Diekai instructed loudly from the car.
    The car started again. Choi ? and his father stood on a hill, waving to their Chinese friends for a long time. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    国际主义的情意
    ——记罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开和朝鲜少年崔?的会见
    启光
    十月二十九日，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团团员、国际主义战士罗盛教的父亲罗迭开和一部分慰问团团员乘车向成川郡朔仓里进发。
    朔仓里是朝鲜普通的一个山村。中国人民光荣的儿子、朝鲜人民亲密的友人——不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的遗体，就安葬在这里。
    汽车转过一个山角，朔仓里就到了。
    这里站着一大群穿着雪白的节日新装的朝鲜人民。他们为了欢迎慰问团的到来，已经在这里等候七个钟头了。慰问团的代表扶着罗迭开老先生下车，崔?飞跑着迎上来，一把把罗迭开抱住了，半天说出了一句话：“爸爸！你可来啦！”
    “是啊！我来看你和你们村里的父老们来了！”罗迭开用手轻轻地抚摸着崔?的头。崔?的父亲崔鼎汉（前译为崔正万）也迎上来，长久地握着罗迭开的手，并深深地躬下身去行礼。这时，欢迎的人群，把中、朝两国国旗同时高举起来，红光映照在所有人们的脸上。
    崔?、崔鼎汉和“罗盛教生产突击队”的男女队员们，把罗迭开抬起来向村中走去。人们欢呼着，孩子们跑上来献花，老人们挤上来握手。人们笑着，跳着……
    崔?和崔鼎汉扶着罗迭开经过罗盛教河，顺着一条平坦的碎石路，向罗盛教山走去。通过两道松枝扎成的彩门，面前就是一座鲜红壮丽的亭子。亭子正面的一个巨幅匾额上写着“万古流芳”四个大字。崔?告诉罗迭开：“这是盛教哥哥的纪念亭！”
    顺着碎石路向右拐去，就到了罗盛教烈士的墓地。墓前矗立一座高大的墓碑，碑上刻着金日成首相的题词，墓的四周绕着石头栏杆。慰问团人员祭扫了罗盛教烈士墓。
    当天下午朔仓里人民在罗盛教河边举行了隆重的欢迎大会。在会上，罗迭开把他心里的话告诉朔仓里的乡亲们。他说：“我在家时，白天想、黑夜想，总想到朝鲜来看看盛教的战友们，看看盛教的弟弟崔?和他的双亲，也看看你们全村朋友和金日成首相。今天我果然看见你们了，我真兴奋极了。我的儿子盛教虽然牺牲了，但他的愿望已初步实现，我们已经打败了敌人，取得了胜利。”
    晚上罗迭开来到崔?的家里，和崔?父子、崔?的母亲坐在一起谈家常。罗迭开告诉崔?：“你在中国的妈妈、弟弟、妹妹们身体都很好，也都很想你。今年家里收了几千斤谷子，养着四头牛、两只猪，生活不错。你的二妹和二弟都在读书，学习成绩很好。”接着，罗迭开又问崔?家里的生活情况。崔?说：“咱家今年的粮食够吃。我和两个弟弟都在学校读书。我今年上初中一年级了。我真想同你一起到中国去，看看中国的妈妈、弟弟和妹妹们，可是学校里的功课紧，走不开。将来一定要去。”
    罗迭开笑了。他用手比划着说：“你有空再去吧！可不能把学业荒废了。你在校读书，也要学你盛教哥哥小时候那样，不把功课做完决不休息。”
    崔鼎汉不断地把水果和栗子送到罗迭开的面前。两位老人又亲切的谈起来。崔鼎汉说：“本来我应该带着崔?到中国看你去，可是这回你却远道跑到这里来了。真使我过意不去。罗老先生，崔?就像你的亲生儿子一样，他会成一个有用的人。”罗迭开兴奋地说：“是啊，我见着了崔?，很满意。有毛主席、有金日成首相，我们都变成有福气的人啦！”
    一家人就这样一直畅谈到深夜。
    这天晚上，崔?侍候罗迭开在他家休息。他躺在罗老先生身边。
    次日清晨，崔?又扶着罗迭开到罗盛教烈士的墓地去。罗迭开久久地看着他儿子墓地四周的景色。这时太阳刚刚升起来，罗盛教山上满是红色的枫叶，罗盛教河的水在静静的流着，周围褐色的田野刚刚收割过，好像在中国一样。
    老人回头来看看崔?，随即从口袋里把罗盛教牺牲前寄给他的一张全身相片拿出来，他在相片背面写道：“我把盛教的这张照片送给你，希望你继续奋斗到底！”崔?恭敬地接过照片，深深鞠了一躬。
    早饭以后，慰问团的同志们到崔?家里去慰问。罗迭开和崔?，及崔?的双亲在一起合照了一张相片，留作永远的纪念。
    慰问团离开朔仓里时，全村的人一程又一程的送行。崔?父子更舍不得罗迭开走。他父子俩和罗迭开坐在一辆汽车里，陪送了十多公里。他们不断地嘱咐罗迭开：“保重身体！到家来信！”虽然慰问团同志和罗迭开一再劝阻，但是他们坚持送下去。直到第三次停车，大家才把崔?父子劝住了。下车后，崔?又挣脱人们的手臂，用手把着车窗，依依不舍地望着罗老先生。
   “努力吧！孩子。”罗迭开在车里大声叮嘱着。
    汽车又开动了，崔?父子站在一个土岗上，长久地向着中国的亲友们挥手。（新华社）（附图片）
