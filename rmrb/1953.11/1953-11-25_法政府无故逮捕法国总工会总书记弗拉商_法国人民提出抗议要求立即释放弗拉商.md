Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Paris dispatch: The French government has unreasonably arrested Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT).

　　On the afternoon of the 22nd, Frachon attended the congress of the Paris Regional Federation of Trade Unions held at the LIDO hall in Paris. In his speech, he emphasized that the unity of the French working class has been strengthened, while the forces of reaction are disintegrating. The French government dispatched thousands of police and secret agents to surround the conference hall and arrested Frachon as he was about to leave. That evening, Frachon was imprisoned in the Fresnes prison.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Paris dispatch: The arrest of Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labour, has aroused the anger of the French people, who demand his immediate release and an end to this illegal persecution.

　　The French Communist Party published a statement in "l'Humanité" saying: "The arrest of Benoît Frachon comes precisely when Laniel and Bidault are about to go to Bermuda at the request of American imperialists; and the arrest warrant was issued when Bidault and René Mayer were preparing to go to Washington. This arrest shamefully violates democratic trade union rights and freedoms. ... The French Communist Party calls on all working people, democrats, and patriots to raise resolute protests in all enterprises, cities, and villages, and to strive for the immediate release of Benoît Frachon, completely crushing the conspiracy against the working class and democracy."

　　The General Confederation of Labour strongly protested the arrest of Frachon and called on the working people of the whole country to resolutely demand his immediate release.

　　The National Committee of the French Republican Youth League, the Seine-et-Oise Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations have protested the arrest of Frachon.

　　Several hundred dockworkers in Bordeaux responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labour and held a short strike on the 23rd to protest the government's arrest of Frachon.

　　Famous writer Jean-Paul Sartre, writer Charles Plisnier, scientific documentary filmmaker Jean Painlevé, and Protestant pastor Henri Roser, among others, jointly issued a statement, pointing out that the government's arrest of Frachon was "groundless" and demanding the immediate restoration of Frachon's freedom.

    法国人民提出抗议要求立即释放弗拉商
    【新华社二十三日讯】巴黎消息：法国政府无理地逮捕了法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商。
    二十二日下午，弗拉商出席了在巴黎丽姝大厅举行的巴黎区工会联合会代表大会。他在会上发表演说，强调指出：法国工人阶级的团结已经加强，而反动派的力量正在分崩离析。法国政府出动了上千个警察和密探把会议厅包围起来，在弗拉商要离去的时候逮捕了他。当天晚上，弗拉商就被投入了费雷纳监狱。
    【新华社二十四日讯】巴黎消息：法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商的被捕，激起了法国人民的愤怒，他们要求立即释放弗拉商，并终止这种非法的迫害。
    法国共产党在“人道报”发表文告说：“逮捕贝诺瓦·弗拉商，正是在拉尼埃和皮杜尔根据美帝国主义者的要求而要去百慕大的时候；而逮捕的根据，是皮杜尔和雷纳·迈耶准备到华盛顿去的时候所下的逮捕令。可见，这次逮捕可耻地破坏了民主的工会权利和自由。……法国共产党号召全体劳动人民、民主分子和爱国者在各企业、城市和乡村中提出坚决的抗议，并且争取立即释放贝诺瓦·弗拉商，完全粉碎反对工人阶级和民主的阴谋。”
    法国总工会猛烈抗议逮捕弗拉商，并且号召全国劳动人民坚决要求立刻释放弗拉商。
    法兰西共和青年联盟全国委员会执行局、塞纳—瓦斯省工会联合会及其他组织，都抗议逮捕弗拉商。
    波尔多的好几百个码头工人响应总工会的号召，在二十三日举行了短期罢工，抗议政府逮捕弗拉商。
    名作家让保罗·萨特、作家夏林·布苏诺斯、科学纪录片制片人让·班勒夫和新教牧师亨利·罗塞等联名发表声明，指出政府逮捕弗拉商是“毫无根据的”，并且要求立即恢复弗拉商的自由。
