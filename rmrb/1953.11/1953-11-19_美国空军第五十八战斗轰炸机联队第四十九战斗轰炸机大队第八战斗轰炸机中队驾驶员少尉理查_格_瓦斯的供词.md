Confession of Second Lieutenant Richard G. Vath, Pilot of the 8th Bomber Squadron, 49th Bomber Group, 58th Bomber Wing, U.S. Air Force

I am Richard G. Vath, Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-2222690. In November 1950, I was sworn into the U.S. Air Force in Kansas City. Around April 2, 1952, I flew from the United States to the Far East. Upon arriving in Japan, I was transferred to K-2 Air Force Base near Daegu, Korea, and assigned to the 49th Bomber Group.

I was hit by anti-aircraft fire during my 24th mission and forced to parachute from my damaged aircraft over North Korea.

At that time, I was performing a ground support mission. I was very close to the ground when I jumped. My parachute barely opened before I landed, and during the final stage of my descent, I floated through the flames caused by the crash of my plane, resulting in severe burns to my hands, face, and knees.

I lost consciousness upon landing, but the Chinese troops who captured me transported me to a bunker a safe distance from the front lines to treat my injuries. I regained consciousness in this bunker.

The troops I had just bombed and strafed gave me food, water, cigarettes, and even a magazine to read. I was treated very well there. After three days at the front, I was transferred further north by truck and eventually stopped at a Chinese hospital. I stayed in this hospital for almost a month, receiving first-class care from the doctors and nurses.

I am especially grateful for this, because without first-class treatment and care, my burns would have resulted in terrible scars. But now my face is exactly as it was before, without scars, and I have no adverse effects from the injury.

During this time, I thought a lot about my life. I began to realize that many of the things I had done in the Korean War were terrible crimes against civilians, and in fact, crimes against all of humanity.

I am a Christian, and I often prayed in the hospital. I felt that I could not hide what I had done and pray with a light heart in the evening. The Chinese had proven themselves to be my friends. They gave me food, treated my injuries, and gave me clothes, tobacco, sugar, and everything else I needed. All I could give them in return was repentance and the truth. Now I have a calm mind, and I feel happy.

I have exposed the evil acts of my government in dropping germ bombs. Only when I have seen my former enemies as friends will I reveal these despicable acts.

Around the end of April, while I was conducting training flights at K-2 Air Force Base near Daegu, we listened to a speech by a captain. His name was never told to us; he did not tell us, nor was he introduced. He began his speech by saying, "Gentlemen, during your time in the 49th Group, you will sometimes carry germ bombs." This shocked me beyond description. I remembered seeing articles in "Look" and "Life" magazines in the United States about Chinese accusations that the U.S. was dropping germ bombs. Those magazines claimed that these Chinese accusations were false. At that time, I believed what the magazines said, and I myself thought this was impossible. But now I know the truth. We Americans are using germ bombs, and I myself must drop them. I felt disgusted and disappointed that my country would do such a thing.

The captain told us that the germ bombs we would use were the same size, shape, and appearance as regular bombs, but their explosion was not as violent as regular bombs. The explosion only served to open the germ bomb to release its contents. He said that we would carry this type of germ bomb for the most part; when dropping them, because the explosive force was small, there was no danger from the explosion shock.

He further said that we would be assigned the best aircraft in the squadron to reduce the danger during takeoff. If we could not drop them normally, we could only drop all the germ bombs in the target area, or, in the event of mission failure, drop them all into the sea ten miles east of Pohang.

The captain concluded his speech by informing us that we must never discuss anything about germ bombs with anyone, not even among ourselves. If we were found to be discussing germ bombs, we would be court-martialed and subjected to the most severe punishment according to the Air Force regulations on violating confidentiality.

The captain also mentioned that if we declared a mission a failure without a legitimate reason, that is, simply because we were carrying germ bombs and did not want to drop them on the enemy, we would also be punished.

After the captain finished speaking, he said, "That's all, you can leave."

On May 16, 1952, I carried out my first combat flight mission with the 8th Squadron of the 49th Bomber Group. Between May 16, 1952, and July 17, 1952, I carried out a total of twenty-four combat flight missions, in three of which I dropped germ bombs.

The target of my first germ warfare mission was near Suncheon, around June 10, 1952. The group briefing was conducted around 1:00 PM in the group briefing room. The operations officer, intelligence officer, meteorology officer, and ground liaison officer each briefed us according to standard operating procedure. The group leader then briefed us on tactics and formation, and emphasized the accuracy of bombing in this mission. After the group briefing, my flight leader, Lieutenant Johnson, briefed me again, saying that I was to carry two germ bombs on this mission. He also said that I could fly at a lower altitude than usual when bombing, and not be afraid of explosion shock, because the explosive force of the germ bombs was small. Otherwise, the flying and bombing techniques were the same as usual.

We took off around 3:00 PM, flying towards the target area at an altitude of 25,000 feet. After we reached the target area, I flew in a shallow dive, dropping two germ bombs. During this mission, we did not encounter enemy aircraft, and the ground fire was very light. After this mission, we reported back in the group intelligence room as usual.

My second germ warfare mission was carried out around June 25, 1952, with the target being a hydroelectric power plant near Heungnam. The group briefing was held around 1:00 PM, and twenty-four pilots attended. The group leader was Lieutenant Colonel Blood, who was also my flight leader. After the group briefing, Lieutenant Colonel Blood briefed me, saying that I was to carry two germ bombs on this mission. Around 4:00 PM, we reached the target area, and then, according to the briefing, each flight took turns bombing the hydroelectric power plant. I flew in a shallow dive, dropping my two germ bombs. The two bombs landed approximately 300 to 500 feet from the target. After landing, the report was conducted in the same manner as usual.

Around July 1, 1952, I carried out my third germ warfare mission, with the target being some trucks parked in a village north of Cheorwon. This mission used thirty-six aircraft. After the general group briefing, my flight leader, Lieutenant Johnson, instructed me to carry two germ bombs on this mission.

My takeoff time was around 7:00 AM. We flew towards the target area at an altitude of 25,000 feet. Over the target, a command aircraft had located the truck convoy. My flight made two sweeps over the vehicles, once to drop bombs, and once to fire rockets. I followed the number three aircraft down to make a shallow dive, and dropped my two germ bombs. During this mission, we did not encounter enemy aircraft, and I did not see ground fire.

I have committed crimes against the people of North Korea and China by dropping germ bombs on them. I understand that even if I devote the rest of my life to working, I can never compensate for the disaster I have already caused to these people. I believe that by speaking out about the germ bombs, I can slightly help to correct the mistakes I have made. For me personally, my confession has "lifted a weight off my chest," and now that I have confessed, I can face each new day with a happier heart.

    美国空军第五十八战斗轰炸机联队第四十九战斗轰炸机大队第八战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员少尉理查·格·瓦斯的供词
    我是理查·格·瓦斯，美国空军少尉，军号AO—2222690。在一九五○年十一月，我在堪萨斯城宣誓加入美国空军，约在一九五二年四月二日乘飞机由美国来远东。于抵达日本后，我被调到朝鲜大邱附近的K—2空军基地，并且被指派到第四十九战斗轰炸机大队。
    我在执行第二十四次任务时被高射炮火击中，被迫在北朝鲜从我的被击中的飞机中跳伞。
    那时我正在执行一次地面支援任务。当我跳伞时，距地面很近。我的降落伞在我着陆前刚刚张开，并且，在我下降的最后阶段，飘过由于我的飞机撞毁所引起的火焰，使我的双手、脸部和膝部受到了严重的烧伤。
    我在着陆时失去了知觉，但俘获我的中国部队把我运到距火线有一段安全距离的一个地堡中，治疗我的创伤。在此地堡中我恢复了知觉。
    我刚才轰炸扫射过的部队给我食物、饮水、香烟、甚至一本杂志阅读。在此我受到非常好的待遇。在前方呆了三天以后，我被用卡车再向北转送，最后在一个中国医院中停下来。我在此医院中住了几乎一个月，受到医生和护士的头等照顾。
    我对这点特别感激，因为若不是有头等的治疗和照顾，我的灼伤就会招致可怕的疤痕，但现在我的脸部和原先一模一样没有疤痕，也没有感到受伤后的不良后果。
    在此时期，我对我自己的一生想得很多。我开始认识到我在朝鲜战争中曾经做过的许多事情，都是对平民的可怖罪行，实际上是对全人类的罪行。
    我是一个基督教徒，在医院中我时常祷告。我感到我不能隐藏我曾经作过的事情，而同时以轻快的心情在晚上作祷告。中国人已经证明他们是我的朋友，他们给我食物，治疗我的创伤，给我衣服、烟草、糖等我所需要的一切东西。我所能给予他们作为报答的只有忏悔和真话。现在我有了平静的心境，我感到愉快。
    我已经揭发了我国政府投掷细菌弹的邪恶行为。只有当我已经视昔日的敌人为朋友时，我才会揭露这种卑恶行为。
    约在四月底，当我在大邱附近的K—2空军基地作训练飞行期间，我们听了一次一个上尉的讲话。他的姓名始终没有告诉我们，他没有对我们说，也没有人介绍他。他开始他的讲话说：“诸位，当你们在第四十九大队期间，你们有时将要携带细菌弹。”这使我感到无法形容的震惊。我记起在美国时看到“展望”及“生活”杂志上载有关于中国人控诉美国投掷细菌弹的事。那些杂志声称这些中国人的控诉是虚假的。那时我相信那些杂志所说的，并且我自己也认为这是不可能的事。但是现在我知道真相了。我们美国正在使用细菌弹，而我自己亦必须去投掷它们。我想到我的国家居然会做这种事情而感到厌恨和失望。
    该上尉对我们说：我们所使用的这种细菌弹的大小、形状和外表与正规普通炸弹一样，但其爆炸不似普通炸弹剧烈。爆炸仅在于使细菌弹打开，以便放出内容物。他说：我们将绝大部分携带此种类型的细菌弹；投掷它们时，因为爆炸力小，所以没有爆炸震荡所致的危险。
    他进一步说：我们会被派给中队内最好的飞机以减少起飞中的危险。假使不能将它们正常地投下的话，只有在目标地区，才可将细菌弹全部扔下，或在任务失败的情况下，将它们全部扔于浦项以东距岸十英里以外的海中。
    该上尉结束讲话时通知我们，绝对不能和任何人、甚至不能在我们互相之间谈论关于细菌弹的任何情况。假使我们被发现在谈论细菌弹时，我们会受到军法审判，并按照空军有关违反保密的法规，受到最严厉的惩罚。
    该上尉并提及，若无正当原因而宣告任务失败，就是说仅仅因为我们带有细菌弹而不愿意对敌人投掷的话，也将受到惩罚。
    该上尉讲话完毕后说：“讲完了，可以走开了。”
    一九五二年五月十六日，我在第四十九战斗轰炸机大队第八中队执行了第一次战斗飞行任务。在一九五二年五月十六日至一九五二年七月十七日的期间，我共计执行了二十四次战斗飞行任务，其中在三次任务中，我投掷了细菌弹。
    我第一次细菌战任务的目标是在顺川附近，约在一九五二年六月十日。大队简令于下午一时左右在大队简令室进行。作战官、情报官、气象官和地面联络官逐一按照标准操作程序，向我们作了简令。大队领队接着对我们简令战术和编队，并且强调这次任务中投弹的准确性。大队简令完毕后，我们的小队领队詹森中尉又对我简令说，在这次任务中，我要携带两枚细菌弹。他又说：我在投弹时，可以飞得比一般情况下的高度低一些，不必惧怕爆炸震荡，因为细菌弹的爆炸力小，此外，飞行和投弹技术和通常的一样。
    我们大约在下午三时起飞，以二万五千英尺的高度飞向目标地区。我们抵达目标地区后，我以浅角度俯冲飞行，投下了两枚细菌弹。在这次任务中，没有遭遇到敌机，地面炮火也很轻微。这次任务后，我们像通常一样，在大队情报室作了汇报。
    我的第二次细菌战任务是约在一九五二年六月二十五日执行的，目标是兴南附近的一个水力发电厂。大队简令在下午一时左右举行，共有二十四名驾驶员出席。大队领队是布勒德中校，他也是我的小队领队。大队简令之后，布勒德中校对我简令说，这次任务中，我要携带两枚细菌弹。约在下午四时，我们到达目标地区，接着按照简令，各小队轮番轰炸此水力发电厂。我以浅角度俯冲飞行，投下了我的两枚细菌弹。两弹落地处距目标约三百至五百英尺。着陆后，汇报按通常相同的方式进行。
    约在一九五二年七月一日，我执行了第三次细菌战任务，目标为铁原以北一村落中停着的一些卡车。这次任务使用了三十六架飞机。在一般的大队简令完毕后，我的小队领队詹森中尉指示我在这次任务中，携带两枚细菌弹。
    我的起飞时间约在早晨七时。我们以二万五千英尺的高度飞向目标地区。在目标上空，一架指挥机已找到了卡车群。我的小队向车辆作了两次扫掠，一次是投弹，还有一次是放射火箭。我跟着第三号机飞下作浅角度俯冲。投下了我的两枚细菌弹。在此次任务中，没有遭遇到敌机，我也没有看到地面炮火。
    我对北朝鲜和中国的人民投掷了细菌弹，已经对他们犯了罪行。我明白即使尽我剩余的岁月来致力工作，也永远不能补偿我对这些人民所已经造成的灾祸。我相信由于我说出了细菌弹的情况，而能稍微有助于纠正我已犯的错误。对我个人来说，我的坦白使我“释去了胸中的重负”，现在我坦白后，我能以较愉快的心情，面对每一个新的日子。
