Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 25th: Commanders and fighters of all branches and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly welcome the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed by representatives of the Chinese and Korean Democratic People's Republic governments.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have fought side by side with the Korean people for more than two years, are joyfully spreading the news of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. They unanimously expressed their determination to guard their positions more vigilantly and vigorously assist the Korean people in their reconstruction efforts. Tan Shanhe, a commander of an engineering unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said: "This agreement will further consolidate and develop the traditional and close fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and is of great significance for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. During the war, the engineering unit supported the production activities of Korean factories, mines, and enterprises. After the armistice, they immediately helped the Korean people rebuild their homes and honorably participated in the reconstruction of Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Korean Democratic People's Republic. In the future, we will continue to work hard to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war and work with the Korean people to thoroughly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue." Yang Xingshen, a soldier from a certain unit, said: "The Soviet Union is helping the Korean people with 1 billion rubles for construction, and our country has signed an economic and cultural cooperation agreement with the Korean government, and is also using huge sums of money to help Korea with its recovery work. This shows how close the unity and deep the friendship is between the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and how powerful the force for defending peace is!" Kang Shuangyin, the political instructor of a second-class meritorious service company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, said: "During the war, I was thinking about helping the Korean people rebuild their heroic country in the future. The signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement fully meets our wishes. It is our pride to build our own country well, and it is also our pride to help the heroic Korean people restore their construction. Therefore, we are determined to guard our positions more vigilantly, prevent the enemy's conspiracy of aggression, and protect the construction cause of the people of our country and the people of Korea."

When the first-class meritorious service company of a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding the Kim Seong front heard the news of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the soldiers applauded enthusiastically and raised their guns to cheer "Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!" A certain unit of the Volunteer Army, which had established outstanding merits in the counterattack south of Kim Seong on the eve of the Korean armistice, was holding a youth representative meeting. When all the representatives heard the news, they stood up and cheered for several minutes. Qin Maoliang, a platoon leader of a certain unit, said: "The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is condensed with blood. In the future, we must not only guard our positions more vigilantly, but also better cherish every mountain, every river, every grass, and every tree of the Korean people, and strengthen our close unity with the Korean people."
