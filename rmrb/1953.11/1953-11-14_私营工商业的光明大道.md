The National Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has concluded. This congress is the first national alliance of private industrialists and businessmen in China. During the meeting, the representatives enthusiastically discussed the general line of the state during the transition period, gradually clarified the future of the country and the path that private industrialists and businessmen should take, and unanimously passed a resolution to "unanimously support the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period, and the policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce." It also called on "private industrialists and businessmen across the country to actively engage in businesses that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, accept the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, and actively adapt to the state's requirements for socialist transformation." The meeting announced the official establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, adopted its charter, and elected its leading body. There is no doubt that this congress will play a huge role in strengthening the unity and education of patriotic private industrialists and businessmen across the country, and in gradually realizing the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

The general line of our country during the transition period stipulates that private industry and commerce must gradually realize socialist transformation through the path of state capitalism. This is a bright road pointed out by the state for private industrialists and businessmen.

Because our national bourgeoisie once participated in the people's revolutionary cause, and today it is a class in the four-class alliance under the leadership of the working class, and capitalist industry and commerce is one of the five economic components under the leadership of the state-owned economy, that is, the socialist economy, the working class does not adopt a policy of deprivation towards private industry and commerce, but adopts the policy of gradually transforming it into socialist enterprises through the path of state capitalism. At this meeting, many representatives used their own personal experiences to prove that gradually realizing the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through the form of state capitalism is a very fair and reasonable method. It is beneficial to the country and the people, and also beneficial to the capitalists themselves, and it is beneficial to the public, private, labor, and capital. For the benefit of the people and for the needs of economic construction, the state must of course plan, step-by-step, and differentially incorporate private industry and commerce into the orbit of state capitalism; and all patriotic private industrialists and businessmen should also strive to create conditions and actively and consciously strive to embark on this glorious road, which is true patriotism.

In the past four years, after various democratic social reforms, especially after the great "Five-Anti" movement in 1952, the number of law-abiding private industrialists and businessmen has gradually increased, and a group of advanced elements has emerged. They have a broad vision and can see the future of the country and the direction of private industry and commerce; they lean towards the Communist Party and the People's Government, love the country and abide by the law, actively improve production and operation, and maintain considerable connections among industrialists and businessmen. This is a good phenomenon. But it should also be pointed out that there are still a few private industrialists and businessmen who do not understand the righteousness and continue to engage in illegal activities that endanger the interests of the country and the people. This is what the state must resolutely stop and what patriotic industrialists and businessmen must resolutely oppose. For example, some private factories, seeing the market prosperity, actually resist state processing and ordering; some private industrial and commercial households, although accepting processing and ordering, cut corners, falsely report costs, or raise work fees, seize raw materials, or fraudulently obtain fixed funds, delay delivery, or deliberately use substandard goods to pass off as good goods, so that they can take them to the market for self-sale when the processing unit does not accept them. There are many such cases. We know that as long as a private factory processes and orders for the state, it is no longer a general private capitalist enterprise, but a state capitalist enterprise. This kind of enterprise is not only morally but also legally responsible for the completion of the state's economic plan. Furthermore, the relationship of processing and ordering is not only an ordinary buying and selling relationship, nor is it just a contractual constraint, but also a relationship of leadership and being led. Therefore, this kind of behavior of destroying processing and ordering, attempting to stir up trouble and dominate in the small world of the free market, is obviously intolerable to the government and the people.

In fact, processing and ordering is also beneficial to private enterprises. For example, the national private cotton textile industry, which processes and accepts state orders, has seen its production volume increase year by year. Taking the total production volume of yarn and cloth in 1949 as 100, the cotton yarn production volume in 1950 was 106.87, in 1951 it was 131.15, and in 1952 it was 177.10. With the increase in production, the business situation of enterprises has also greatly improved. Looking at the profit and loss situation of 38 private textile enterprises in Shanghai, in 1950, 18 factories had a surplus and 20 factories had a loss; in 1951, 31 factories had a surplus and 7 factories had a loss; in 1952, 35 factories had a surplus and 3 factories had a loss; in 1953, 37 factories had a surplus and only one small factory had a loss. As for enterprises that have developed from processing and ordering to joint state-private enterprises, because they are more planned and management has been fundamentally improved, everyone benefits. It can be seen that state capitalism is not only beneficial to the country and the people, but also beneficial to the capitalists themselves.

Some private industrialists and businessmen, due to a lack of understanding of the significance of the transition period, believe that since the general line of the state during the transition period has been announced, capitalist industry and commerce will be immediately changed into socialist enterprises, so production and operation are not active, and some people even withdraw the funds that should be invested in production. It should be told to them that this is a misunderstanding. On the contrary, since it is explained that it is a transition period, it can be seen that it is not a sudden change one morning. The transition period needs to go through a considerable period of time. How long it will take depends on the efforts and achievements of the people of the whole country in socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Gradual transition means steady progress. It is neither possible to stagnate nor to be impetuous and rash. During the transition period, private industry and commerce has its due responsibilities, that is, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the masses of workers, actively produce, supply products to the country, help material exchange, accumulate funds for the country, and train technical and management cadres for enterprises. As long as private industrialists and businessmen follow the guidelines pointed out by the general line of the transition period and truly make contributions to the people during the transition period, then in the future, when they enter socialist society, the people have no reason not to want him; his life and work will be properly arranged, and his future will be as bright as the people's. Therefore, the idea and practice of not actively operating is wrong and should be corrected. If, after explanation and education, they still stubbornly carry out passive resistance and withdraw funds, then this is their own path to ruin.

There are also some private industrialists and businessmen, mainly capitalists of commerce and small and medium-sized enterprises, who either believe that industry can take the road of state capitalism, but commerce cannot take this road, or believe that their enterprises are small in scale and have little capital, so they cannot take the road of state capitalism, and therefore show disappointment. We must also make it clear to them that the scope of the state capitalist economy is very broad, and there are many forms. In addition to the existing forms, new forms can also be created. As long as capitalists engage in legal operations, accept the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, and only take a reasonable share of the profits of the enterprise, then their enterprises can serve the country's planned construction to a certain extent and to a certain degree. Therefore, that kind of disappointment is unfounded.

In order to correct many wrong ideas and wrong behaviors of private industrialists and businessmen and guide them to the road of state capitalism, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the education of patriotism and law-abiding among private industrialists and businessmen, so that they can see the bright future of the motherland and understand the truth that personal interests and local interests should be subordinate to national interests and people's interests. The resolution of this conference pointed out: "Socialist transformation is a long-term task. In order to do this work well, we must combine the transformation of individuals with the transformation of enterprises. We must first strengthen the transformation of personal thinking and work style, strengthen the education of patriotism and law-abiding and the education of the state's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce, and constantly and repeatedly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conduct serious criticism and struggle against all illegal behaviors." This is entirely necessary. Recently, the people who have been exposed in various places who have committed serious illegal acts, although are a minority among private industrialists and businessmen, but the number of people who have committed illegal acts to varying degrees accounts for a considerable number. Their illegal behaviors, such as tax evasion, cutting corners, resisting state processing and ordering, hoarding and profiteering, disrupting the market, resisting market management, resisting worker supervision, oppressing and buying off employees, if not stopped, will hinder the state's construction plan and harm the interests of the people and the country. It can be seen that strengthening the education of patriotism and law-abiding among private industrialists and businessmen is as urgent a task as strengthening the management and leadership of state economic organs over private industry and commerce.

Now, the National Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has concluded. After this meeting, the representative figures of the industrial and commercial circles have understood the general line of the state during the transition period. The local party and government leading organs should, in accordance with the content of the speech of Comrade Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, strengthen the leadership of the local party and government organs in the work of private industry and commerce and state capitalist enterprises on the one hand, and summarize the experience; on the other hand, they should organize in a widespread and in-depth manner the study of the general line of the state during the transition period among industrialists and businessmen in various industries and trades, and raise their awareness. In industry, private enterprises should be called upon to actively increase production and practice economy and supply the needs of the country and the broad masses of the people in accordance with the principle of supply, production, and sales balance on the state's planned track; in commerce, merchants should be called upon to correct their business style, obey market management, oppose speculation and disruption, and develop urban and rural exchanges. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, all patriotic private industrialists and businessmen united in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will be able to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country, recognize the bright future of the country and the path that private industrialists and businessmen should take, and actively participate in the glorious ranks of struggling to realize the general line of the transition period.

### 私营工商业的光明大道

    私营工商业的光明大道
    全国工商业联合会会员代表大会闭幕了。这次大会是中国私营工商界第一次的全国大联合。在会议期间，代表们热烈地讨论了国家过渡时期的总路线，逐步明了了国家的前途和私营工商业者所应走的道路，一致通过了决议，“一致拥护国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务和对私营工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策。”并号召“全国私营工商业者必须积极经营有利于国计民生的事业，接受人民政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，并积极适应国家的社会主义改造的要求。”会议上宣告了全国工商业联合会的正式成立，通过了它的章程，选出了领导机关。毫无疑问，这次大会对加强全国爱国的私营工商业者的团结和教育，对逐步实现私营工商业的社会主义改造，都将起巨大的推动作用。
    我国过渡时期的总路线规定：私营工商业必须经过国家资本主义的道路，逐步实现社会主义改造。这是国家为私营工商业者所指出的一条光明大道。
    由于我国民族资产阶级曾经参加了人民的革命事业，它今天是在工人阶级领导下的四个阶级联盟中的一个阶级，资本主义工商业是在国营经济即社会主义经济领导下的五种经济成份中的一种，因此工人阶级对私营工商业，不是采取剥夺的政策，而是采取通过国家资本主义的道路，把它逐步改变为社会主义企业的方针。在这次会议中，许多代表都以自己亲身的体验，证明了通过国家资本主义这个形式，逐步实现私营工商业的社会主义改造，是很公平合理的办法。它既有利于国家和人民，也有利于资本家自己，对公、私、劳、资各方面都有好处。为了人民的利益，为了经济建设的需要，国家固然必须有计划、有步骤、有区别地把私营工商业进一步纳入国家资本主义的轨道；而一切爱国的私营工商业者也应该努力创造条件，积极地、自觉地争取走上这条光荣的道路，这才是真正的爱国。
    过去四年来，经过各种民主的社会改革，特别是经过一九五二年的伟大的“五反”运动，私营工商业者守法的已经逐渐增多，并且已经出现了一批先进分子，他们有远大眼光，看得见国家的前途和私营工商业的方向；他们靠拢共产党和人民政府，爱国守法，积极改进生产经营，在工商业者中保持有相当的联系。这是一个好现象。但是也应该指出，还有少数不明大义的私营工商业者继续干着危害国家和人民利益的违法行为，这是国家必须坚决制止，也是爱国的工商业者所必须坚决反对的。譬如有些私营工厂看到市场繁荣，竟然抗拒国家的加工订货；有的私营工商业户虽然接受加工订货，但偷工减料，虚报成本；或抬高工缴，侵占原料；或骗取定款，拖延交货；或故意以次货充好货，以便在加工单位不收取时拿到市场上去自销。诸如此类，不一而足。我们知道：私营工厂只要为国家加工、订货，就已经不是一般的私人资本主义企业，而是一种国家资本主义企业了。这种企业对于国家经济计划的完成，不但负有道义上的而且负有法律上的责任。进一步说，加工订货的关系，既不是普通的买卖关系，也不止是契约上的约束，而且是一种领导和被领导的关系。因此，这种破坏加工订货、企图在自由市场的小天地里兴风作浪、称王称霸的行为，显然是政府和人民所不能容忍的。
    事实上加工订货对于私营企业也是有利的。譬如为国家加工和接受国家订货的全国私营棉纺织业，其生产量就逐年增加。以该业一九四九年纱布总生产量各为一○○，棉纺产量一九五○年为一○六·八七，一九五一年为一三一·一五，一九五二年为一七七·一○。随着生产增加，企业的营业情况也大为好转。以上海私营纺织企业三十八个工厂的盈亏情形来看，一九五○年有十八个工厂盈余，二十个工厂亏损；一九五一年三十一个工厂盈余，七个工厂亏损；一九五二年三十五个工厂盈余，三个工厂亏损；一九五三年三十七个工厂盈余，仅有一个小厂亏损。至于由加工订货发展到公私合营的企业，由于计划性更强，管理有了根本的改善，更是个个得利。由此可见，国家资本主义不但对国家和人民有利，对资本家自己也有利。
    有些私营工商业者由于对过渡时期的意义不了解，认为国家过渡时期总路线既经宣布，就是马上要把资本主义工商业改变为社会主义性质的企业了，于是生产经营就不积极了，甚至有些人把应该投入生产的资金也抽走了。应当告诉他们这是一种误会。相反，既然是说明了过渡时期，就可见不是什么一个早上的突变。过渡时期是需要经历一个相当长的时间的，究竟多长，要看全国人民对于社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的努力和成就。逐步过渡，就是稳步前进的意思，既不可以停滞不前，也不可以急躁冒进。在过渡时期中，私营工商业有它应有的责任，这就是在国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督之下，积极生产，对国家供应产品，帮助物资交流，为国家积累资金，训练企业的技术和管理干部。私营工商业者只要按照过渡时期总路线指出的方针，确确实实在过渡时期对人民有了贡献，那末，到了将来，进入社会主义社会，人民是没有理由不要他的；他的生活和工作会得到适当的安排，他的前途和人民一样是光明的。所以那种不积极经营的想法和做法是错误的，应当改正。如果经过解释教育，仍然执迷不悟地实行怠工抵抗，抽走资金，那么这就是自己走上绝路了。
    还有一些私营工商业者，主要是商业和中小企业的资本家，或者认为工业可走国家资本主义道路，而商业无法走这条道路，或者认为自己的企业规模小、资本少，无法走国家资本主义的道路，因而表现出失望的情绪。我们也必须对他们讲清楚：国家资本主义经济的范围很广，形式也很多，除了现有的几种形式以外，还可创造出新的形式。只要资本家们进行合法的经营，接受人民政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，并且只在企业利润中分取合理的部分，那么他们的企业就能够在一定范围内和一定程度上为国家的有计划的建设服务。因此，那种失望情绪是没有根据的。
    为了要纠正私营工商业者的许多错误思想和错误行为，把他们引导到国家资本主义的道路上来，必须在私营工商业者中继续加强爱国守法的教育，使他们看清祖国远大的光明前途，认识个人利益局部利益应服从国家利益人民利益的道理。这次大会的决议指出：“社会主义改造是一项长期的工作，为了做好这项工作，我们必须把个人的改造与企业的改造结合起来。我们首先必须加强个人的思想和作风的改造，加强爱国守法的教育和国家对于私营工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策的教育，不断地和反复地展开批评与自我批评，对一切违法行为进行严肃的批判和斗争。”这是完全必要的。最近各地揭发出来的犯有严重违法行为的人，在私营工商业者中虽然是少数，但在不同程度上犯有违法行为的人则占有相当大的数量。他们的偷税漏税、偷工减料、抗拒国家加工订货、囤积套购、扰乱市场、抗拒市场管理、抗拒工人监督、压迫和收买职工等不法行为，如果不受到制止，就将妨碍国家建设计划，损害人民和国家的利益。由此可见，加强私营工商业者的爱国守法的教育，和加强国家经济机关对于私营工商业的管理领导一样，是一个迫切的任务。
    现在，全国工商业联合会会员代表大会已经闭幕，经过这次会议以后，工商界的代表人物，已经明了了国家在过渡时期的总路线。各地党政领导机关，应当按照政务院财经委员会副主任李维汉同志在大会讲话的内容，一面对当地党和政府机关在私营工商业和国家资本主义企业中的工作加强领导，总结经验；一面在各行各业的工商业者中，普遍深入地组织关于国家在过渡时期总路线的学习，提高他们的觉悟。在工业方面，应当号召私营企业在国家的计划轨道上，依据供、产、销平衡的原则，积极增产节约，供应国家和广大人民的需要；在商业方面，应当号召商人端正经营作风，服从市场管理，反对投机捣乱，发展城乡交流。我们相信：在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结在全国工商业联合会中的一切爱国的私营工商业者必能不负全国人民的热望，认清国家的远大前途和私营工商业者所应走的道路，积极地参加到为实现过渡时期总路线而奋斗的光荣行列里来。
