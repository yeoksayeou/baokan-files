Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 26th: According to TASS, the World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 24th. At the meeting, the speech of Professor Bernal of Britain, who was unable to attend, was read. He pointed out that the World Peace Council must point out a way out of the deadlocked negotiations on disarmament. Recent developments have greatly increased the possibility of effective work for disarmament. He said that more and more people with various political beliefs have recognized the disastrous consequences of arms expansion, and the task of peace advocates is to mobilize these people, present them with an action program, and have them join peace advocates in demanding disarmament.

Professor Infeld, the Polish representative who spoke next, pointed out that the United States wants to use the hydrogen bomb to launch a war, while the Soviet Union, after hydrogen weapon tests, advocated establishing strict international supervision for the implementation of the prohibition of hydrogen weapons. He said that only through consultation in a spirit of goodwill, and through agreements acceptable to all, can the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass destruction be achieved.

Professor Dobretzberger, the Austrian representative, and André Bonnard, the Swiss representative, spoke about the threat of West German re-militarization to Austria and Switzerland. Väinö Mäkelä, the Finnish representative, pointed out the great benefits to Finland of expanding trade with countries such as the Soviet Union and China. He said that Finnish peace advocates demand that the government pursue a peaceful policy towards neighboring countries.

Mrs. Florica Misanţescu, the Romanian representative, exposed the efforts of some Western governments to treat the policy of negotiation with a "policy of strength" and a "Cold War" policy. She said that the interests of international security urgently require major powers to discuss the resolution of disputes, which will play a decisive role in easing international tensions. The Romanian people will firmly support any initiative aimed at strengthening peace and international security.

Isabelle Blume, a member of the World Peace Council and representative of Belgium, pointed out in her speech that the plan to establish the so-called "European Group" is used to disguise the rearmament of West Germany; the rearmament of West Germany has aroused increasingly strong opposition from all peace-loving people. She also emphasized the need to take measures to ease international tensions.

Kokalis, the Greek representative, Seth, the Turkish representative, and Boyoros, the Cypriot representative, who spoke at the meeting, all accused the United States of building military bases in these countries, threatening world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 26th: The Vienna Peace Council held a mass rally on the evening of the 24th in the 15th district, which has a large number of workers' residences, to welcome peace representatives from all over the world. At the meeting, Chinese representative Zhang Bojun, French representative and Bordeaux dockworker Picot, and West German representative Horlitz-Menge delivered speeches.

When the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Kaufmann, representative of the Austrian Peace Council, said that Chairman Mao Zedong led the Chinese people to transform China from a semi-colony into a rich and prosperous country, the participants cheered "Mao Zedong."

    世界和平理事会继续举行会议
    各国代表主张通过协商解决争端
   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十五日讯：世界和平理事会二十四日下午继续举行会议。会上宣读了未能出席会议的英国贝尔纳教授的发言。他指出：世界和平理事会必须为长期陷于僵局的关于裁减军备的谈判指出一条出路。最近的形势大大地增加了为裁减军备而进行有成效的工作的可能性。他说：越来越多的有各种不同的政治信仰的人认识到了扩军的灾难性后果，和平拥护者的任务就是动员这些人，向他们提出行动纲领，使他们与和平拥护者共同要求裁减军备。
    接着发言的波兰代表英费尔德教授指出：美国想利用氢弹发动战争，而苏联在氢武器试验后，主张为实行禁止氢武器而建立严格国际监督。他说：只有通过在善意的气氛中协商，通过大家都能接受的协定，才能做到禁止原子弹和氢弹以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    奥地利代表多布雷茨伯格教授和瑞士代表安德烈·邦纳在发言中谈到了西德重新军国主义化对奥地利和瑞士的威胁。芬兰代表瓦伊诺·麦尔蒂指出与苏联、中国等国家扩大贸易对芬兰的极大好处。他说：芬兰和平拥护者要求政府对邻邦奉行和平政策。
    罗马尼亚代表弗洛里卡·米辛契斯库夫人揭露某些西方国家政府极力想以“实力政策”、“冷战”政策来对待协商政策。他说：国际安全的利益迫切需要大国讨论解决争端，这对缓和国际紧张局势将起决定作用。罗马尼亚人民将坚决支持目的在于加强和平与国际安全的任何倡议。
    世界和平理事会理事、比利时代表伊莎贝丽·布伦姆在发言中指出：成立所谓“欧洲集团”的计划是用来掩饰重新武装西德的；重新武装西德已引起所有爱好和平人民的日益强烈的反对。她并强调了采取缓和国际紧张局势措施的必要性。
    在会上发言的希腊代表科卡利斯、土耳其代表塞特尔、塞浦路斯代表波伊奥罗斯都指责美国正在这些国家建筑军事基地，威胁着世界和平。
   【新华社维也纳二十六日电】维也纳和平理事会于二十四日黄昏在工人住宅较多的第十五区举行了群众集会，欢迎来自世界各国的和平代表们。在会上，中国代表章伯钧，法国代表、波尔多码头工人皮科，西德代表霍里特门格等人发表了演说。
    当会议主席、奥地利和平理事会代表卡夫曼说到毛泽东主席领导中国人民把中国由半殖民地变成了富强繁荣的国家时，与会群众都欢呼“毛泽东”。
