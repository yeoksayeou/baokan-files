    Kaicheng, November 3rd (Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent Hu Jin): Our reporter Hu Jin reports: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC)'s investigation into the atrocities committed by special agents in Camp 28, who murdered our captured personnel Zhang Zilong, continued on November 1st and 2nd. Although the NNRC did not adopt the investigation methods suggested by our side, turning the first day's investigation into a farce, the second day's investigation yielded good results in a short period of one and a half hours due to the Indian Custodial Forces taking more effective and necessary measures. Witnesses identified seven murderers on the spot, and sixteen prisoners of war came forward to testify. The bloody events of the U.S.-directed special agents using murder and terror to prevent our captured personnel from demanding repatriation were fully exposed to the people of the world.

    When the NNRC decided to investigate this incident and two other incidents (Camp 36's special agents setting up a private torture chamber and the murder in the "hospital" on October 1st) based on our accusations, the U.S., although having instructed special agents in advance to exhume and burn Zhang Zilong's body to eliminate evidence, could not eliminate the witnesses. Among the witnesses were not only our returning personnel who had witnessed the atrocities but also our captured personnel who were still suffering from the terror of special agents and unable to return home. Therefore, the U.S. could not conceal its panic and fear regarding these investigations. On October 29th, the United States' Associated Press threateningly said that the exposure and investigation of these incidents "have prompted another crisis that threatens to end the delayed explanation work." The Associated Press also shamelessly once again intimidated the NNRC, saying that these investigations would cause consequences like the bloody incident on October 2nd when Indian troops inspecting the "hospital" were attacked by special agents.

    However, the investigations of these two days proved that as long as the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces can resolutely act in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," and take effective measures against the U.S. special agents' illegal acts of using violent means to carry out counter-explanation plans, they can prevent the rampage of U.S. special agents and ensure the smooth progress of all work.

    A comparison of the investigation situations on the 1st and 2nd will yield a beneficial lesson.

    During the investigation on the 1st, the Indian Custodial Forces only concentrated the prisoners of war from Camp 28 between the first and second barbed wire fences of the camp; and in the open space from the southeast corner to the northwest corner of the camp, a "security guard" arranged by special agents was stationed approximately every five steps to carry out strict surveillance. The special agents coerced the prisoners of war to make a lot of noise and throw stones at our personnel present. Special agents from other camps also shouted loudly to echo and cheer, creating a serious atmosphere of terror. When the witnesses—returning personnel Huang Lichao and You Xuehe—pointed out the tent where the murder took place and the body was buried and began digging, the special agents shouted, "You won't find anything," "What if you don't find anything?" After the excavation yielded no results, they began to identify the murderers and point out the witnesses among the prisoners of war. Huang Lichao and You Xuehe immediately identified the first person in the passing line of prisoners of war as the murderer, "Security Captain" Wu Baoshan. Wu Baoshan had been coercing the prisoners of war to make noise. After being identified, he suddenly looked panicked and shouted wildly at the witnesses, "I'm going to fight you!" At the same time, the special agents immediately coerced the prisoners of war to stir up trouble and rush into the camp in confusion. The murderer Wu Baoshan took the lead in sneaking into the tent. In such a chaotic situation, the witnesses could not continue the identification after only identifying for about ten minutes, but they also pointed out two other murderers, the "Health Section Chief" and three "Captains," to the Indian Custodial Forces personnel present. At that time, the Indian Custodial Forces had not taken effective measures to arrest the murderers.

    The investigation situation on the first day showed that because the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces failed to take effective steps, the investigation work, which still yielded some results despite being conducted under unfavorable conditions, became futile.

    During the investigation on the second day, the Indian Custodial Forces brought out twenty-five prisoners of war each time, who walked past the witnesses one by one for identification. The Indian Custodial Forces also ordered the prisoners of war not to move without permission. Before the identification of the murderers, one prisoner of war rushed out and was shot dead by the Indian army. The special agent elements in the camp no longer dared to make noise, and the special agents in the entire east camp were also silent. The identification work then proceeded in better order. The witnesses identified seven murderers on the spot, including the special agent "Battalion Commander" Zhang Yuwang and the murderer Wu Baoshan, who had been identified on the first day. The murderers were arrested one by one by the Indian Custodial Forces after being identified. At the same time, the witnesses identified fourteen witnesses from the prisoners of war, and two prisoners of war stood at attention and saluted our witnesses, voluntarily requesting to testify. These new witnesses were then led out of the barbed wire by the Indian army, standing tall and proud, and smiling next to Huang Lichao and You Xuehe.

    Not only that, this investigation work also yielded another meaningful result. During the investigation work on the first day, two of our captured personnel climbed the barbed wire fence to request repatriation, one of whom was about to climb over the barbed wire fence, but both were captured back by the special agents and beaten severely on the spot; later, after our side made a request, the Indian Custodial Forces took these two prisoners of war out of the camp after the investigation, thus avoiding the danger of these two being beaten to death by the special agents. During the investigation on the second day, because the Indian troops took effective measures and arrested the special agent murderers, the arrogance of the special agents was frustrated. Therefore, not only did sixteen prisoners of war dare to come out to testify, but also four prisoners of war requested repatriation on the spot, and later thirteen prisoners of war requested repatriation one after another on their way back to the camp.

    Twelve of our captured personnel who were repatriated that day said when talking about why they were so brave that day: "These two days, the 'Battalion Commanders' are all scared, so we are not afraid."

    The investigation situation of these two days once again declared the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s so-called malicious intimidation and blackmail of not using force, otherwise it would cause "mass bloodshed" and "riots." The result of the Indian Custodial Forces taking effective measures against the special agents this time did not result in any "riots." Those U.S. liars clearly hoped that the Indian Custodial Forces would allow the special agents to make trouble when investigating the atrocities of special agents murdering our captured personnel who requested repatriation, further encouraging the rampage of the special agents, and making the investigation work fruitless, and completely sweeping away the authority and prestige of the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces. But the U.S. liars were greatly disappointed.

    The facts are extremely clear that without taking effective measures to deal with the U.S. special agent forces who obstruct the prisoners of war from returning home by violent and terrorist means, the NNRC can only be at the mercy of U.S. special agents or beg them. In this way, it is completely impossible for the NNRC to complete its task. Precisely because of this, this investigation work should not only be limited to completing the handling of this incident, but should also become a powerful basis for improving the current situation of the NNRC, that is, effective action must be taken against the U.S. special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war, the special agent organizations must be disbanded, and the activities of the special agents must be prohibited to ensure the smooth progress of future explanation work.

### 中立国遣返委员会继续调查张子龙被害案  我方作证人指出的凶手当场被捕  事实证明采取有效措施就能打破特务控制

    中立国遣返委员会继续调查张子龙被害案
    我方作证人指出的凶手当场被捕
    事实证明采取有效措施就能打破特务控制
    【本报开城三日专电】本报记者胡今报道：中立国遣返委员会对第二十八号营场特务谋杀我方被俘人员张子龙的暴行事件的调查，在十一月一日和二日连续进行。虽然中立国遣返委员会没有采纳我方建议的调查办法，以致第一天的调查工作变成滑稽剧，但第二天由于印度看管部队采取了较为有效的必要措施，便使调查工作在短短一小时半的时间内获得了良好的结果。作证人当场认出凶手七人，并有十六个战俘出来作证。美方指使特务用谋杀恐怖手段阻止我方被俘人员要求遣返的血腥事件，完全暴露在世界人民面前了。
    当中立国遣返委员会决定根据我方的指控进行对这一事件和其他两个事件（三十六号营场特务私设酷刑室和十月一日“医院”中的谋杀事件）的调查时，美方虽在事前已指使特务将张子龙的尸首挖出烧毁，以消灭罪证，但它无法消灭人证。在人证中不仅有目睹暴行的我方归来人员，而且有仍在身受特务恐怖统治而未能回家的我方被俘人员。所以，美方就不能掩盖他们对这些调查所表现的慌张和恐惧。十月二十九日美国的合众社色厉内荏地以威胁口吻说，这些事件的暴露和调查“已促使产生另一次危机，这种危机威胁着终止已遭到延迟的解释工作”。合众社还无耻地又一次对中立国遣返委员会施行恫吓，说这些调查将引起像十月二日印度部队视察“医院”时遭受特务袭击而酿成流血事件那样的后果。
    但是，这两天的调查证明：只要中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队能够坚决地根据“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”办事，对美方特务以暴力手段进行反解释计划的不法行为采取有效措施，就可以阻止美方特务的横行，使一切工作顺利进行。
    只要比较一下一日和二日的调查情况，就会获得一个有益的教训。
    在一日进行调查时，印度看管部队仅将二十八号营场战俘集中到营场的第一道和第二道铁丝网之间；而自营场东南角至西北角的空道上，战俘中每隔约五步即有一个特务布置的“警备队员”实行严密监视，特务并胁迫战俘大吵大闹，用石头打我方在场人员。其他营场特务也大声叫喊，呼应助威，造成严重的恐怖气氛。当作证人——归来人员黄立超和尤学和指出行凶和掩埋尸首的帐篷并进行挖掘时，特务即大喊“你们挖不到”、“挖不到怎么办”。挖掘无结果后，开始辨认凶手及指出战俘中的作证人。黄立超、尤学和马上指证列队而过的战俘中的第一人即为凶手“警备队长”武宝山。武宝山一直胁迫战俘吵嚷不已，他被指证后，顿然神色慌张地向作证人狂叫“我要跟你拼命”，同时特务立即胁迫战俘骚动起来，混乱地冲入营场；凶手武宝山抢先潜入帐篷。在这样混乱的情况下，作证人不过辨认了十来分钟，就无法再继续进行辨认，但他们又还向印度看管部队在场人员指证出另两名凶手“卫生股长”及三个“队长”。当时，印度看管部队尚未采取有效措施，逮捕凶手。
    第一天的调查情形说明，由于中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队未能采取有效步骤，就使得当时虽然在不利条件下进行而却仍然有了一些结果的调查工作，成为徒然。
    第二天调查时，印度看管部队每一次带出战俘二十五名，一个一个地走过作证人面前，由作证人辨认。印度看管部队并命令战俘不得擅自行动。在辨认凶手前，有一个战俘冲出来，被印军击毙。营场内的特务分子不再敢吵闹，整个东场里营场的特务也鸦雀无声。辨认工作便在较好的秩序下进行。作证人当场先后指证出七名凶手，其中有特务“大队长”张宇旺和在一日已被指证出来的武宝山等凶手。凶手被指证后即由印度看管部队一一加以逮捕。同时作证人并从战俘中指出了十四个作证人，还有两名战俘到我方作证人面前立正敬礼，自动要求作证。这些新的作证人随即挺腰昂首地由印军带出铁丝网，微笑地站立在黄立超和尤学和旁边。
    不仅这样，这次调查工作还得到了另一有意义的结果。在第一天的调查工作中，曾有两个我方被俘人员爬铁丝网要求遣返，其中一人快要爬过铁丝网了，但都被特务抓回，当场遭受毒打；后来经我方提出要求，于调查结束后，由印度看管部队将这两个战俘从营场中带出，才避免了这两人被特务打死的危险。第二天调查时，由于印度部队采取了有效措施，并逮捕了特务凶手，特务气焰受到挫折，于是，不仅有十六个战俘敢于出来作证，而且当场有四个战俘要求遣返，后来又有十三个战俘在返回营场去的途中先后要求遣返。
    十二个当天被遣返回来的我方被俘人员，谈到他们当天为什么这样勇敢回来时说道：“这两天‘大队长’都害怕了，我们就不怕了。”
    这两天的调查情况，使美方的所谓不得使用武力、否则将要造成“大量流血”和“暴乱”一类的别有用心的恫吓和讹诈，又一次宣告破产了。这一次印度看管部队对特务采取有效措施的结果，并无什么“暴乱”。那些美方的谎言家们显然希望印度看管部队在对特务大肆谋杀要求遣返的我方被俘人员的暴行进行调查时，听凭特务捣乱，进一步鼓励特务的横行，而使调查工作毫无结果，并使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的职权和威信完全扫地。但是美方的谎言家们却大失所望了。
    事实摆得极为明显，对付以暴力恐怖手段阻挠战俘回家的美方特务势力，不采取有效措施，中立国遣返委员会就只能听命于美方特务，或向他们乞求，这样，中立国遣返委员会要想完成其任务，那是完全不可能的。正因为这样，这次调查工作就不能仅仅限于完成对这一事件的处理，而且应该成为一个有力的根据来改善中立国遣返委员会所处的目前情况，就是说，必须对混在战俘中的美方特务采取有效的行动，打散特务的组织，禁止特务的活动，以保证今后解释工作的顺利进行。
