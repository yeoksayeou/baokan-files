    The state massively processes orders for private industries in Beijing
    Gradually guiding them into the orbit of the national plan
   [This newspaper dispatch] Over the past four years, private industries in Beijing have accepted a large number of planned processing orders from the state, resulting in significant development in production. According to statistics from the Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, the state has continuously expanded processing orders for private industries in Beijing to meet the increasing living standards of the people and the gradual development of national economic construction, leading to a continuous increase in the total value of processing orders. Using 1950 as 100, the index for 1951 was 209, 1952 was 237.62, and the first half of 1953 was 229.6. The proportion of the total value of processing orders in the total value of private industrial production has also increased year by year. The proportion in 1950 was 31 percent, 30.5 percent in 1951, 35.7 percent in 1952, and it reached 54.05 percent in the first half of 1953. By June of this year, 32 out of the 35 types of private industries in the city had accepted processing orders, with a total of more than 3,600 processing plants, accounting for 12.39 percent of the total number of private industrial enterprises in the city; the number of employees was approximately 40,000, accounting for 33.3 percent of the total number of private industrial workers in the city. In the first half of this year, the state had already processed and sold all or most of the main commodities produced by private industries in Beijing, such as flour, various fabrics, woolen garments, fountain pens, files, and musical instruments.
    Due to the state's planned and large-scale processing orders, the production of private industries in Beijing has been reorganized or is in the process of being reorganized, and production has seen significant development, with the total value of production increasing year by year. Using 1950 as 100, the index for 1951 was 212.16, 206.82 for 1952, and reached 131.9 in the first half of 1953. In the early days of liberation, Tongyi Water Pump Factory had only 2.8 million yuan in capital, only 11 main machines, and only 19 employees; however, after receiving large-scale processing orders from the state, it has developed year by year. As of now, its capital has increased to more than 910 million yuan, the number of main machines has increased to 19, and the number of employees has increased to 89. The various water pumps produced have become best-selling products.
    State processing orders also help private industries improve their management, enhance production technology, reduce production costs, and carry out planned production. This year, the state has implemented long-term, comprehensive processing of industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihoods, such as flour, colored cloth, and woolen garments. This has strengthened the planning of private industries, enabling them to carry out planned production according to the needs of the people under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and gradually brought them into the orbit of the national plan. In the past, private weaving factories in Beijing could only weave striped cloth and small cloth, but after four years of assistance from state-owned companies, they have been able to weave high-quality Beijing fine cloth, khaki, and twill fabric. In the past, the machine manufacturing industry could only produce machines such as lathes and turning lathes, but now it can manufacture large machines. For example, Yushengxiang Electric Motor Factory can manufacture air coolers for large generators, and Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory can manufacture heavy-duty steel rolling mills. Because the machine and iron industry has to undertake large batches of technically complex processing orders, it feels the difficulty of decentralized management, and has actively organized joint ventures to concentrate manpower and resources to coordinate production. In the past, there were only two factories with more than 80 people in the industry, but now there are more than 20 joint ventures with 100 to 400 people; and their business has greatly expanded compared to when they were managed separately. Due to the guidance of the state, the quality of products has improved. In the past, the product quality of Yongguang Wire Factory was very poor and did not meet specifications. After the assistance of the trust company's processing orders, the product quality has gradually improved, and the quality of the wires currently produced is very good.
    State processing orders are carried out according to the needs of the people and the country, and in coordination with national economic construction. Therefore, they have played a significant role in supporting national economic construction and supplying the market. For example, this year, the capital has a large construction task and needs a lot of equipment and materials. The state has placed a large number of processing orders for bricks and tiles, sand and gravel, plumbing equipment (furnace pieces, boilers, etc.), roof frames, steel windows, small hardware, and furniture and woodenware. It has been able to fully control the production and unified distribution of several major building materials such as bricks, sand and gravel, and plumbing equipment. This has promptly supplied the needs of construction units. This year, private industries in Beijing have produced a large number of military towels, gloves, mosquito net cloth, canvas, raincoats, leather shoes, candy, as well as saddles, weapon carts, and tipper trucks, which strongly supported the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. In terms of market supply, private industries in Beijing have produced a large number of flour, various fabrics, socks, towels, leather shoes, clothing, woolen garments, as well as various oils and various medicines for state-owned enterprises, meeting the needs of the people's material lives.
      However, there are still some shortcomings in the current processing orders in Beijing, such as insufficient planning, a shortage of some raw materials, the refusal of some capitalists to accept processing orders, the continuous discovery of the five-poison behaviors of cutting corners and using inferior materials, and the phenomenon of delayed delivery is still very serious. The Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce is working on resolving all of these issues.

    国家对北京市私营工业大量进行加工订货
    逐步引导它们纳入国家计划轨道
   【本报讯】四年来，北京市私营工业接受了国家有计划的大量的加工订货，生产上已有很大的发展。根据市工商管理局统计：国家为了适应人民生活水平日益提高和国家经济建设逐步发展的情况，对北京市私营工业不断扩大加工订货，加工订货总值不断增长。以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年为二○九，一九五二年为二三七点六二，一九五三年上半年为二二九点六。加工订货总值在私营工业生产总值中所占的比重也逐年加大了。一九五○年比重是百分之三十一，一九五一年为三十点五，一九五二年为三十五点七，一九五三年上半年比重已达五十四点○五。到今年六月止，全市三十五种私营工业中，已有三十二种工业企业接受加工订货，加工厂共三、六○○多家，占全市私营工业企业总户数的百分之十二点三九；职工人数约四万多人，占全市私营工业总人数的百分之三十三点三。今年上半年国家已对北京市私营工业主要商品如面粉、各种布、绒衣、金笔、锉刀、乐器等，全部或大部进行加工和包销。
    由于国家有计划的大量加工订货，已使北京市私营工业生产得到改组或正在进行改组，生产上得到很显著的发展，生产总值逐年增加。以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年为二一二点一六，一九五二年为二○六点八二，一九五三年上半年即达一三一点九。同益水泵工厂在解放初期，资金只二百八十万元，主要机器只有十一台，职工仅十九人；但经过国家大量加工订货，逐年发展，截至目前资金已增至九亿一千多万元，主要机器已增加到十九台，职工人数增至八十九人。出产的各种水泵成为畅销货。
    国家加工订货，更帮助私营工业改善经营管理，提高生产技术，降低生产成本，进行有计划的生产。今年国家对于有利于国计民生的工业如面粉、色布、绒衣等，都是长期的、全部的加工，这样就加强了私营工业的计划性，使其在国营经济领导下，按照人民的需要进行计划生产，逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。过去北京私营织布厂只能织条布、小布等，经过国营公司四年来的帮助改进，已能织质量很好的北京细布、卡叽布、斜纹布了。机器制造业过去只能生产一些车床、镟床之类的机器，现在已能制造大型的机器，如裕生祥电机厂能制大型发电机用的空气冷却器；朝阳电机厂能制重型轧钢机了。机器铁工业因为要承做大批技术复杂的加工订货，感觉分散经营的困难，纷纷组织合营，以集中人力、物力，配合生产。过去该业八十人以上的工厂只有二家，现在一百至四百人的合营厂已达二十多家；并且在业务上比分散经营时有很大开展；由于国家的指导，产品质量提高了。永光电线厂过去产品质量很差，不合规格，经过信托公司加工订货的帮助，产品质量逐步提高，目前所产电线，质量很好。
    国家加工订货，是根据人民和国家的需要，配合国家经济建设进行的。因而在支援国家经济建设以及供应市场等方面，起了很大作用。如今年首都建设任务大，需要很多器材，国家对砖瓦、砂石、水暖器材（炉片、锅炉等）、房架、钢窗、小五金、以及家具木器等，都进行大量加工订货，对于砖、砂石、水暖器材等几种主要建筑材料，已能完全掌握，统一分配生产。这就及时供应了建筑单位的需要。今年北京私营工业大量生产了军用毛巾、手套、蚊帐布、帆布、雨衣、皮鞋、糖果、以及马鞍、武器车、翻斗车等，有力支援了抗美援朝运动。在供应市场方面，北京私营工业为国营企业生产了大量面粉、各种布、袜子、毛巾、皮鞋、服装、绒衣、以及各种油类和各种药品，满足人民物质生活的需要。
      但是，目前北京加工订货中，还存在一些缺点，如计划性不够，有些原料还缺乏，部分资本家拒绝加工订货，偷工减料的五毒行为不断发现，误期交货的现象还很严重等。所有这些，市工商管理局正着手进行解决中。（巫德华）
