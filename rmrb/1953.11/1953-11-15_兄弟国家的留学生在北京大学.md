Foreign Students from Brotherly Countries at Peking University

    How Happy I Am to Study Here
    Korean Student Wu Zaisong
    The moment I crossed the Tumen River and stepped onto Chinese soil, I felt an atmosphere of peace and prosperity. In the shops and canteens of the city, laughter of peaceful people could be heard; the entrances of shops were crowded with people. Workers happily held newly bought floral fabrics, leading their daughters across the roads lined with maple trees on both sides. Cars, bicycles... shuttled back and forth. The electric lights shone as bright as day. Everywhere here is a scene of peace and happiness.
    Our group of eleven Korean students arrived at the renowned Peking University with extraordinary excitement. Upon entering the nationally styled school gate, one could see the beautiful office building. As I walked on the asphalt path in the middle of the lawn, I felt warm and happy, like a son returning from the front line throwing himself into his mother's arms.
    Shortly after arriving at the school, we began our studies with the warm help of Chinese teachers and classmates. The first lesson was learning the phonetic alphabet. When we learned the most difficult letters, the teacher gave us individual tutoring, and Chinese classmates also came to help us. Soon, we could say a few Chinese phrases. At this time, the teachers and classmates were as happy as if they were watching a child start to speak.
    Every night before going to bed, some classmates would ask me to make sentences with the vocabulary I had learned that day. If there were mistakes, he would explain it to me again and again; if I still didn't understand, he would write it down on paper and ask me to remember it. This serious and responsible spirit deeply moved me. I realized that this precious quality could only be found in the youth of New China under the teachings of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    One day, when I was cleaning the room with my classmates, President Ma Yinchu personally came to see us. The Chinese classmate introduced me to President Ma. He stroked my back and asked, "Are you used to the life here?" His fatherly voice moved me very much. I deeply felt that the friendship between our Chinese and Korean people is unbreakable!
    Today, a year later, I can pick up a pen and express my thoughts effortlessly. This makes me feel very excited.
    When the people of our motherland are selflessly rebuilding the beautiful homeland destroyed by American imperialism, how happy I am to be able to study here! I will certainly live up to the ardent concern of Chairman Mao and the Chinese people for us, and I am determined to complete the study tasks assigned to me by the motherland and the people. When I return to my motherland in the future, I can say to Premier Kim Il-sung without shame, "I am ready!"

    My Life and Thoughts Have Become Richer
    Hungarian Student Gao Ende
    I think that people who stay in a foreign country for a long time have two kinds of emotions: happiness on one hand and worry on the other. The happiness comes from seeing a new world and gaining new experiences; the worry comes from encountering some difficulties in daily life in this new world.
    When I came to China from Hungary three years ago, I had both of these emotions. As soon as I arrived in Beijing, I accepted many new things that I had never experienced before. It can be said that every day spent in New China has enriched my life and thoughts. This makes me feel very happy. But I also encountered some difficulties in my studies. Originally, I thought that learning Chinese was not difficult at all, and that it could be learned by spending a little time. The fact is not so. For a long period of time, I spent a lot of time every day practicing pronunciation (i.e., the "four tones") and practicing Chinese characters. This showed me that although learning the Chinese language is not very difficult, it is not easy either.
    Later, thanks to the help of my teachers and friends, and thanks to my gradual understanding of China, all difficulties were overcome. The school gave me many opportunities to fully understand the new life of the Chinese people; I also used every means to understand and comprehend the living habits, learning methods, etc. of Chinese classmates. In this way, I slowly became able to connect my daily living habits with my environment, and my scope of learning also expanded.
    The love of Chinese classmates for me is manifested in their selfless help to me. For example, when I was still at Tsinghua University, I made many good friends with Chinese students majoring in science and engineering. At that time, I was not very good at reading Chinese books, but I really wanted to understand Chinese literature. Therefore, I often bothered them with some questions about new Chinese literature. As soon as they discovered this situation, they began to regularly and carefully read magazines such as "Literary Gazette" and "People's Literature" and report literary news to me. When I arrived at Peking University, the classmates also helped me enthusiastically.
    After three years of study, I can now read literary magazines and study the works of famous Chinese writers. But I still encounter some difficulties in writing and conversation. For example, my pronunciation is not very accurate when I speak, and I also make some errors in grammar, and my vocabulary is not rich enough. I still have to continue to work hard in the future.

    Any Difficulty Can Be Overcome
    Romanian Student Jiang Dongni
    In my memory, there is a most vivid impression that remains in my mind to this day: one afternoon in the winter of 1950, a car carrying several of our Romanian classmates drove to Tsinghua University. As soon as we got out of the car, many young Chinese friends swarmed up to us. They pinned the badge of Tsinghua University on our chests. What followed was a firm handshake and a warm embrace.
    After starting to study, the difficulties encountered were even greater than imagined. In terms of learning the Chinese language, we found it particularly difficult to pronounce and write characters. We could not distinguish some characters that have the same pronunciation but different meanings. But with the enthusiastic help of Chinese teachers and classmates, we initially completed the learning task in a year and a half.
    The reason why we were able to achieve great results in our studies is because we all realized that learning the Chinese language and characters is not our purpose. We only use it as a tool to obtain the rich cultural knowledge of China, understand the heroic revolutionary struggle history of the Chinese people, and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the new construction cause. Not only that, but in the future we will also contribute our share to the cultural exchange work between China and Romania.
    In the summer of 1952, we returned to our motherland, Romania, for summer vacation. There, everyone was eager to learn about the situation in China and the lives of the Chinese people. The working people of Romania are very interested in every achievement of the fraternal Chinese people in the construction cause. This greatly strengthened our determination and perseverance in learning.
    In the autumn of the same year, we came to China again. From then on, we chose a major and started to officially attend classes with Chinese classmates. I entered the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Peking University, majoring in Language and Literature. The new study brought new difficulties. For example, some professors did not speak in Beijing dialect, but in other difficult dialects; many Chinese reference books and literary works had many unfamiliar characters, and Lu Xun's works were particularly difficult to understand. But Chinese teachers and classmates helped us again in their spare time. In order to help us make up notes, Chinese classmates repeated the lecture to us after class; the teachers also took time every week to tutor us. In one year, we studied the representative works of Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, Zhao Shuli, and others. During the study period, we watched some dramas and operas, which not only made us know the content of many works, but also made us understand the positive characters in Chinese literary works more deeply and concretely. For example, after watching the opera "Xiao Erhei's Marriage", we fell in love with the brave and optimistic Xiao Erhei and Xiao Qin more deeply; watching the drama "Qu Yuan" made me concretely understand Chinese society more than 2,200 years ago and a great, upright, and talented patriotic poet.
    Now, the new semester has begun again. I am studying the history of new literature after the Chinese "May Fourth" Movement. This is a course that I am most interested in, because it not only allows me to understand the development process of new Chinese literature, but also allows me to recognize the role played by Chinese revolutionary literary writers and their works in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. What makes me most happy is that I have the opportunity to understand Lu Xun's activities and works. I know that new difficulties are happening every day, but I believe that with the help of teachers and classmates, any difficulty can be overcome.

    I Saw China's Past and Future
    Czechoslovak Student Shi Yirui
    I once studied Chinese and Chinese history for a year in the Department of Oriental Languages at Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Later, I was sent to China to study (first at Tsinghua University, then transferred to Peking University).
    In China, I study Chinese literature. I had previously read several excellent Chinese literary works translated into Czech: the poems of Du Fu, Li Bai, and Bai Juyi, Mao Dun's "Midnight" and Zhao Shuli's novels, as well as Zhou Libo's "Hurricane". I was so excited after reading these works!
    Although we still have many difficulties in our studies, we have already begun to study China's splendid culture and revolutionary history. Now, we read the People's Daily every day and read Chairman Mao's great works, such as "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On New Democracy," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."
    The first time I saw Chinese opera was in the spring of 1952. Later, I watched many operas, such as Peking opera and Yue opera. My favorite are the Peking opera "San Cha Kou" and the Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai". In Yangzhou, I watched two relatively short local dramas. The performances of these two dramas were vivid, which proved that there is also nationally styled art in the smaller cities in China.
    We also learned about the life of modern China from other aspects. We visited factories, villages, and schools near Beijing. We had conversations with workers, farmers, and young classmates. In Tongxian near Beijing, when we talked to an old man, he said to us:
    "My second son gave his life for the motherland on the Korean battlefield. I want to dedicate everything I have to the motherland to build a new China!" Every such meeting made me more deeply aware of the noble qualities of the Chinese people.
    We also visited other places, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin. Although the places we have seen are only a small part of China, it seems that we have seen the entire China and saw China's past and future.
    I realized the concern of the Chinese people and Chinese youth for the Czechoslovak people, and felt the friendship of the Chinese people for us. How Chinese youth respect the Czechoslovak national hero Fučík! One day, I showed a picture of Fučík to a child in his teens. I asked him, "Do you know who this is?" He said, "Of course I know, this is Fučík!" "How do you know him?" He replied, "Didn't he write 'Notes from the Gallows'?"
    I have been in China for almost two years, and I have been learning constantly during these two years. For me, every day is precious. This summer vacation, I went back to my country once, and from the contact with the masses, I further realized how our people are eager to learn about the new China. My responsibility is great. I should study harder in the future to answer the expectations of the Czechoslovak people for us and the concern of the Chinese people for us.

### 兄弟国家的留学生在北京大学

    兄弟国家的留学生在北京大学
    能在这里学习是多么幸福啊朝鲜留
    学生　吴在松
    渡过图们江一踏上中国的土地，我就感到和平、繁荣的气氛。城市的商店和食堂里，传出了和平人们的笑声；商店门口挤满了人。工人们高兴地拿着刚买到的花布，带着女儿穿过两旁种满枫树的马路。汽车、自行车……穿梭般地来往着。电灯照得像白天一样亮。这里到处都是和平幸福的景象。
    我们一行十一个朝鲜同学怀着异常兴奋的心情，到了全中国闻名的北京大学。一进那具有民族风格的校门，就可以看到美丽的办公楼。当我走上草坪中间的柏油小路时，感到温暖、愉快，就像从前线归来的儿子投向母亲的怀抱。
    到校以后不久，我们便在中国教师和同学们的亲切的帮助下，开始了学习。第一课是学注音字母。当我们学到最困难的字母时，教师便对我们进行个别辅导，中国同学也来帮助我们。不久，我们就会说几句中国话了，这时教师和同学都好像看到孩子开始学会说话似地那样高兴。
    每天晚上睡觉以前，有的同学还让我用当天学过的词汇来造句，有了错误，他就一遍又一遍地给我解释；如果我还不明白的话，他就用笔在纸上写好叫我记下来。这种认真负责的精神，深深地感动了我。我体会到这种宝贵的品质只有在共产党和毛主席的教导下的新中国青年身上才可以找到。
    有一天，我和同学一起打扫屋子的时候，马寅初校长亲自来看我们，中国同学向马校长介绍了我。他抚着我的后背问道：“生活习惯了吗？”他那慈父般的声音使我非常感动，我深深感到我们中朝两国人民之间的友谊是牢不可破的啊！
    一年以后的今天，我可以拿起笔来不费力地表达自己的思想了。这使我感到万分兴奋。
    当我们祖国的人民正在忘我地重建被美帝国主义破坏了的美丽的家园的时候，我能在这里学习是多么幸福啊！我一定不辜负毛主席和中国人民对我们的殷切的关怀，决心努力完成祖国和人民交给我的学习任务，将来在我回祖国的时候，能在金日成首相面前无愧地说：“我已经准备好了！”
    我的生活、思想丰富起来了匈牙利留学生　高恩德
    我想，长时期留在外国的人都有两种情绪：一边高兴，一边眈心。高兴的是因为会看到一个新的世界，会得到新的经历；眈心的是会在这个新的世界里碰到一些日常生活中的困难。
    三年前我从匈牙利来到中国的时候，就有这两种情绪。一到北京，我就接受了许许多多的、从来没有经历过的新事物。可以说，每一个在新中国度过的日子都使我的生活、思想丰富起来。这使我觉得非常幸福。但在学习中也碰到了一些困难。原来我以为，学习中文一点都不难，只要费少许的时间，就可以学到的。事实并不如此，有一个较长时期，我为了练习发音（即“四声”）、练习汉字，天天都费去好多时间。这就给我说明了：学习中国语言虽然不是十分难，但也并不容易。
    后来，由于我的教师们、朋友们的帮助，由于我对中国认识的逐渐深入，一切困难都克服了。学校方面给我很多机会来全面地认识中国人民的新生活；我也用一切的办法去认识和理解中国同学们的生活习惯、学习方法，等等。这样，我慢慢地能把我的日常生活习惯跟我的环境相联系起来，我的学习范围也就扩大了。
    中国同学们对我的热爱，表现在对我的大公无私的帮助上。拿个例子来说，当我还在清华大学的时候，跟很多理工科的中国同学交了好朋友。那时候，我还不大能看中文书，但很想了解中国文学。因此，常常拿一些有关中国新文学的问题来麻烦他们。他们一发现我这种情形，就开始经常地、详细地读“文艺报”、“人民文学”等杂志，给我报告文学新闻。到了北京大学，同学们也都热情地帮助我。
    经过三年的学习，我已能看文学杂志，研究中国著名作家的作品。但我在写作、会话中仍遇到一些困难，比如我说话时发音不大准确，文法上也发生某些错误，词汇也不够丰富，今后还得继续努力。
    任何困难都是可以克服的  罗马尼亚留学生　江冬妮
    在我的记忆中，有一个最鲜明的印象直到今天还留在我的脑子里：一九五○年底一个冬天的下午，一辆汽车载着我们几个罗马尼亚同学驶向清华大学。一下汽车，就有许多年青的中国朋友拥上前来。他们把清华大学的校徽佩带在我们的胸前。接着来的是紧紧的握手和热情的拥抱。
    开始学习后，遇到的困难比想像中的还要多。在中国语文学习方面，我们特别感到困难的是发音和写字。我们不能辨别一些发音相同而意思不同的字。但在中国教师和同学们的热情帮助下，我们在一年半的时间内初步完成了学习任务。
    我们在学习上所以能获得大的成绩，是由于我们都认识到，学习中国语言文字，并不是我们的目的，我们只是把它当作一种工具，通过它去取得中国的丰富的文化知识，了解中国人民英勇的革命斗争历史以及中国人民在新的建设事业中所获得的巨大成就。不仅如此，今后我们还要在中罗两国文化交流工作中贡献出自己的一份力量。
    一九五二年夏天，我们回到祖国——罗马尼亚去过暑假。那里，到处都有人渴望着了解中国的情况、中国人民的生活。罗马尼亚劳动人民对兄弟的中国人民在建设事业中的每一个成就，都感到很大的兴趣。这大大地加强了我们学习的决心和毅力。
    同年秋天，我们又来到了中国。从那时起，我们选择了专业，开始和中国同学一起正式听课了。我进了北京大学中国语言文学系语言文学专业。新的学习带来了新的困难。比如，有些教授讲课时不是用北京话，而是用其他难懂的方言；许多中文参考书和文学作品里面生字很多，特别难懂的是鲁迅的作品。但中国教师和同学又在课余帮助了我们。为了帮助我们补笔记，中国同学在下课后给我们重复讲一次；教师们也每星期抽时间来辅导我们。在一年中，我们学习了鲁迅、茅盾、丁玲、赵树理等的代表作。在学习期间，我们看了一些话剧和歌剧，这不仅使我们知道了许多作品的内容，而且使我们比较深刻而具体地了解了中国文学作品中的正面人物。比如，我们看了歌剧“小二黑结婚”，就更深刻地爱上了勇敢的乐观的小二黑和小芹；看了话剧“屈原”，使我很具体地认识了两千二百多年以前的中国社会以及一个伟大的、正直的、天才的爱国诗人。
    现在，新的学期又开始了。我学习着中国“五四”运动以后的新文学史。这是我最感兴趣的一门课程，因为它不但使我了解中国新文学的发展过程，同时使我认识到中国革命的文艺作家及其作品在反帝、反封建斗争中所起的作用。而最使我高兴的，是我有机会了解鲁迅的活动和作品。我知道，新的困难每天都在发生着，但我相信，在教师和同学的帮助下，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    我看到了中国的过去和未来  捷克斯洛伐克留学生　史以锐
    我曾经在捷克斯洛伐克布拉格大学东方语文系学过一年中文和中国历史，以后我被送到中国来留学（开始在清华大学，后来又转到北京大学）。
    在中国我学中国文学。以前我曾看过几本翻译成捷克文的中国优秀文学作品：杜甫、李白和白居易的诗，茅盾的“子夜”和赵树理的小说，以及周立波的“暴风骤雨”等作品。看了这些作品，我是多么兴奋啊！
    虽然我们在学习中还有很多困难，但是我们已经开始学习中国的灿烂的文化、革命历史。现在，我们每天看人民日报，读毛主席的伟大作品，如“论人民民主专政”、“新民主主义论”、“中国革命和中国共产党”，以及“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。
    头一次看中国戏是在一九五二年的春天。以后我看了很多的戏，如京剧和越剧。我最喜欢的是京剧“三岔口”和越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”。在扬州，我曾看过两个比较短的地方戏剧，这两个戏剧的演出是生动的，这证明了在中国的较小城市里边也同样有着富于民族性的艺术。
    我们还从其他各方面认识了现代中国的生活。我们参观了北京附近的工厂、农村和学校。我们曾跟工人、农民和青年同学谈过话。在北京附近的通县，我们跟一个老头谈话的时候，他对我们说：
  “我的第二个儿子在朝鲜战场上为祖国献出了生命。我要把我的一切献给祖国，来建设新中国！”每次这样的见面，使我更深地认识了中国人民的高贵品质。
    我们也参观了其他的地方，如南京、上海、杭州、天津。虽然我们所看过的地方不过是中国的一小部分，但我们好像看到了整个的中国，看到了中国的过去和将来。
    我认识到了中国人民和中国青年对于捷克斯洛伐克人民的关怀，感到了中国人民对于我们的友情。中国青年怎样敬爱着捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄伏契克啊！有一天，我把伏契克的像片给一个十多岁的孩子看。我问他：“你知道这是谁？”他说：“当然知道，这是伏契克！”“你怎样知道他的？”他回答道：“‘绞刑架下的报告’不是他写的吗？”
    我留在中国已经快两年了，这两年来，我不断地学习着。对于我，每一天都是宝贵的。今年暑假，我回国了一次，从和群众的接触中进一步认识到了我国人民怎样渴望着了解新中国。我的责任是重大的，今后应该更加努力学习，来回答捷克斯洛伐克人民对我们的期望和中国人民对于我们的关怀。
