    Guarantee Support for Korean Reconstruction
    Jiao Xinglin, Model Worker of Beijing Municipality
    When I saw in the newspaper that Marshal Kim Il-sung had come to visit our Chairman Mao, I was overjoyed beyond words. On behalf of all the workers of our North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, I salute Marshal Kim Il-sung and the victorious Korean people under his leadership.
    When I think of the happy life our workers have now, the continuous expansion of our factory's scale, the continuous development of production, and the achievements of our motherland's construction in all aspects, I think of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and all the Korean people under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung. My association is so natural, as if they are inseparable. Isn't that so? If it were not for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and the Korean people under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung for their three years of arduous struggle, could we have such peaceful days? Could our factory develop so quickly? Could our country build with such peace of mind? Wouldn't the American bandits come to ravage us as they ravaged Korea?
    I have seen so many atrocities of American bandits massacring the Korean people in movies, newspapers, books, and paintings! So many cities and villages were bombed and burned to ashes, so many beloved children were slaughtered in their mothers' arms, farmers could not go to the fields, and workers had no factories. Who can find anything more heinous than the American bandits! We must record these countless bloody debts on the American bandits' account, and we will never forget it. Therefore, I always feel that I have a responsibility to support the Korean War and the Korean people. When it comes to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, I have a lot to say. I have contributed a share of strength to this movement, but I always feel that I have not done enough and can do better, so that I can be worthy of our Volunteers and the Korean people. Last year, in the movement to support Resist America, Aid Korea, our factory completed the state-assigned task of 120,000 horse-drawn plows two months and two days ahead of schedule, and also reduced the cost of each seven-inch walking plow by 40,000 yuan, completing the increased production and frugality plan of 36.3 billion yuan eight days ahead of schedule. In this movement, our workers have improved their political consciousness. Under the slogan of "The factory is the battlefield," 19 labor models and 52 advanced workers emerged in the factory. I was elected as a model worker of Beijing Municipality this time. In order to continue to support the Korean front, our team has guaranteed the balanced production of the first and second quarters this year, and can overfulfill the plan on a monthly basis. In the factory-wide evaluation, our plowshare team won the first place in the factory. Comrade He Shouwen, chairman of the trade union, even brought a gong and drum team, carrying condolences by car, to my home to express their regards. At that time, my heart was warm, and tears came out. In the old society, was this something that we laborers could have imagined?
    Now, the motherland has put forward a new call for increased production and frugality to us. In order to respond to the call of the motherland and to support the peaceful construction of the Korean people, our team has greatly improved production after discussing and improving the labor organization. The number of plowshares produced by our team of 33 people in one day has increased from 2,700 in the past to more than 4,000, and the scrap rate has dropped from the highest of 30% in the past to the lowest of 8% now. From September 16th to the end of this year, our team guarantees to increase production by 712.2 million yuan.
    We welcome the Korean government delegation headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, and we must support the construction of the Korean people as we build our own motherland. Our Chinese and Korean people must always be united like brothers.

### 保证支援朝鲜建设

专栏：欢迎金日成元帅和朝鲜政府代表团

    保证支援朝鲜建设
    北京市劳动模范  焦兴林
    从报纸上看到金日成元帅来看望我们毛主席了，我真有说不出的高兴。我代表我们华北农业机械厂的全体工人，向金日成元帅敬礼，向在金日成元帅领导下取得胜利的朝鲜人民敬礼。
    我一想到眼前我们工人这种幸福的生活，我们工厂规模不断扩大，生产不断发展的情况，我们祖国各方面建设的成就，就想起了我们中国人民志愿军，想起了金日成元帅领导下的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜全体人民。我联想得是这样自然，好像它们是不可分的一样。不是吗？要是没有中国人民志愿军，没有金日成元帅领导的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民三年来的艰苦斗争，我们能有这样安生的日子吗？我们的工厂能够这样快地发展吗？我们的国家能够这样放心地建设吗？美国强盗不是也会像糟踏朝鲜那样来糟踏我们吗？
    我从电影上、报纸上、书上、画上看了多少美国强盗残杀朝鲜人民的暴行啊！那么多城市和村庄被炸成烧成一片灰，那么多叫人疼爱的儿童，被屠杀在母亲怀里，庄稼人不能下地，工人们没有了工厂，谁还能再找到比美国强盗更伤天害理的呢！这些算不清的血海深仇，我们一定要记在美国强盗账上，我们永远忘不了它。所以我老觉得自己有一种责任，就是要好好支援朝鲜战争，支援朝鲜人民。提起抗美援朝运动来，我有很多话要说，在这运动中我也算出了一分力量，但我总感到自己还是做得不够，还可以做得更好一些，这样才能对得住咱们志愿军，对得住朝鲜人民。去年，我们工厂在支援抗美援朝运动中，全年提前两个月另两天完成了国家交给的十二万部马拉犁的任务，还把每部七吋步犁的成本，降低了四万元，全年提前八天完成三百六十三亿元的增产节约计划。在这个运动中，我们工人都提高了政治觉悟，我们在“工厂就是战场”的口号下，全厂出现十九个劳动模范，五十二个先进工作者。我就是这一回当选了北京市劳动模范的。为了继续支援朝鲜前线，今年我们小组已保证了第一、二季度的均衡生产，每个月都能按月超额完成计划，在全厂评选中，我们犁铧小组得了全厂第一名。工会主席何守温同志，还带着锣鼓队，用汽车拉着慰问品，到我家去慰问，当时我心里热呼呼地，眼泪都出来了，在旧社会，这是我们这些下力的人想得到的事情吗？
    现在，祖国又向我们提出新的增产节约号召了。为了响应祖国的号召，为了支援朝鲜人民的和平建设，我们小组经过讨论，改善了劳动组织后，生产大大地提高了。我们全组三十三人一天生产的犁铧，由过去二千七百个已增加到四千以上，报废率由过去最高的百分之三十，下降到现在最低百分之八。从九月十六日起到今年年底止，我们全组保证增产七亿一千二百万元。
    我们欢迎以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜政府代表团，我们一定要像建设自己的祖国一样，来支援朝鲜人民的建设。我们中朝两国人民一定要永远团结得和兄弟一样。
