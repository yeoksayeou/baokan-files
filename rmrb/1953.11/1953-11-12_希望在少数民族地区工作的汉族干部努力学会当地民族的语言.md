    Hoping that Han Cadres Working in Ethnic Minority Areas Will Strive to Learn Local Ethnic Languages
    Feng Zhong
    The backward state of ethnic minorities in our country, caused by reactionary rulers in history, must be changed through long-term efforts. Although the growth of ethnic minority cadres has been rapid in the past four years, with nearly 100,000 people participating in various tasks, it still cannot keep up with actual needs. This requires a certain number and appropriate quality of Han cadres to participate in the work of ethnic minority areas to help people of all ethnic minorities develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings. However, Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas first encounter the obstacle of language barrier. Not being able to understand the language severely limits interactions with local people, and naturally encounters many unavoidable difficulties in work.
    The right of ethnic minorities to use their own ethnic languages and scripts must be respected. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that all ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages and scripts. The Implementation Outline of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China also clearly stipulates: "The autonomous organs of each ethnic autonomous region may adopt the languages and scripts of their respective ethnic groups to develop their cultural and educational undertakings." Because "millions of people can only make progress in cultural, political, and economic development by using their own national language." (Stalin: The National Question and Leninism) Therefore, Han cadres must never force ethnic minorities to learn Chinese for their own convenience. Doing so would be a serious violation of the Party's ethnic policy, a concrete manifestation of Han chauvinism, and practically impossible.
    In order to break the barrier of language, it is necessary for Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas to learn the local ethnic language as much as possible; naturally, all cadres of other ethnicities who do not understand the local ethnic language, as well as cadres of the same ethnicity, also have this need. Because approaching ethnic minority people, deeply understanding the situation, publicizing and implementing the Party's policies, eliminating historical ethnic divisions, and enhancing ethnic unity all require language as a tool. The work in ethnic minority areas will be carried out step by step in the future, which further increases the importance of learning ethnic languages. Many Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas have felt that their relationship with the local people of all ethnic groups has become more harmonious and their work has become more in-depth after learning the local ethnic languages; ethnic minority cadres and people also feel more convenient and closer to Han cadres. Many cadres in Luxi County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province, have learned the local ethnic languages and are welcomed by ethnic minority people wherever they go. Local Dai compatriots cordially shout to working cadres: "Zai Nong, Ga Lie Du!" (Brother, come to my house to play). Some Tibetan people in Xikang Province believe that it is a great pleasure for Han cadres to learn Tibetan. Lenglong DaWa (Tibetan), the county magistrate of Xiangcheng County, Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xikang Province, said: "In the past, Tibetan and Han cadres had to use translators even when eating at the same table; now that Han cadres understand Tibetan, they can discuss matters directly, reducing a lot of trouble." These facts fully demonstrate that the relationship between Han cadres and local ethnic minority people will undoubtedly be further closer after Han cadres learn the local ethnic languages; it also shows how eagerly ethnic minority cadres and people expect Han cadres to learn their languages.
    Of course, learning an ethnic language will encounter many difficulties, especially since there are certain difficulties in compiling teaching materials and assigning teachers, and many ethnic minorities do not yet have their own scripts. But as long as we have a firm determination to serve ethnic minorities in the long term, study diligently, and immerse ourselves in research, all difficulties in learning can be overcome. Han cadres who come to work in ethnic minority areas have the glorious task of helping fraternal ethnic groups develop. If they do not know the local ethnic language, the masses of people cannot understand when policies are publicized, and their wishes and requirements cannot be reflected. This cannot but be an obstacle to perfectly completing this glorious task. Now we have many favorable conditions for learning ethnic minority languages. First, there is the support of the Party and the People's Government; second, ethnic minority people warmly welcome our study and will enthusiastically provide assistance; we have a good learning environment, with opportunities for practical use and practice at any time during work and leisure time. Under these favorable conditions and environment, as long as we have the determination and confidence, it is entirely possible to learn an ethnic language. The fact that Han cadres working in pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are learning the Tibetan language published in today's newspaper is a good proof. Haven't many of them been able to speak ordinary Tibetan after a short period of study?
    Now, many Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas have started learning local ethnic languages one after another, and have already made significant achievements. Some areas have established learning organizations and regular learning systems, and are carrying out learning in a led and planned way; and leading cadres take the lead in participating and persisting in learning. These situations show that the vast majority of Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas are determined to serve ethnic minorities in the long term, arduously, and sincerely, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. We hope that those who have a considerable foundation in learning can continue to consolidate and improve; those who have already started learning can persevere; and those who have not yet started learning can catch up.
    Some areas, such as Xinjiang Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, have minority cadres who are also automatically learning Chinese, encouraged by the Han cadres learning ethnic languages, which is very welcome. Han cadres should enthusiastically help them in their studies. On the basis of helping each other learn languages, Han and minority cadres will further enhance mutual understanding, unite further, and jointly build a big family of love and cooperation among all ethnic groups.

    希望在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部努力学会当地民族的语言
    冯众
    历史上反动统治者所造成的我国少数民族的落后状态，必须经过长时间的努力才能够改变过来。四年多来少数民族干部的生长虽然很快，到现在已经有近十万人参加了各项工作，但还赶不上实际的需要。这就需要有一定数量的和适当质量的汉族干部参加少数民族地区的工作，帮助各少数民族的人民发展其政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业。但是，汉族干部到少数民族地区工作首先遇到了语言不通的障碍。不通语言，和当地群众往来就要受到很大限制，在工作上自然会遇到许多不可避免的困难。
    少数民族使用自己民族的语言文字是必须被尊重的。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领规定：各少数民族均有发展其语言文字的自由。中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要也明白规定：“各民族自治区自治机关得采用各民族自己的语言文字，以发展各民族的文化教育事业。”因为“千百万人民群众只有使用本民族语言才能在文化、政治和经济发展方面获得进步”。（斯大林：民族问题与列宁主义）为此，汉族干部绝不能为了自己的方便，强迫少数民族学习汉语汉文。这样做，就是严重违犯党的民族政策，就是大汉族主义思想的具体表现，而且在事实上也是办不到的。
    为了打破语言不通的壁障，在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，尽最大可能学会当地的民族语言是必要的；自然，凡是不懂当地民族语言的其他民族干部，以及本民族干部，也同样有这个需要。因为接近少数民族群众，深入了解情况，宣传、贯彻党的政策，消除历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂，增进民族团结，都需要有语言作为工具。今后少数民族地区的工作将要一步步深入开展，这更增加了学习民族语言的重要性。许多在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部学会当地民族语言之后，都感到和当地各族人民的感情更融洽、工作也深入了；少数民族干部和群众也感到方便，对汉族干部也更亲近了。云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区潞西县的许多干部学会了当地民族语言，走到哪里都受到少数民族人民的欢迎，当地傣族同胞看到工作干部就亲切地喊：“宰弄，戛列都！”（大哥，到我家玩）。西康省有的藏族人士认为汉族干部学习藏语是一件大喜事。西康省藏族自治区乡城县县长冷龙大洼（藏族）说：“以前藏汉族干部一桌吃饭也要用翻译；现在，汉族干部懂得了藏话，有事可以直接商量了，减少很多麻烦。”这些事实充分证明了汉族干部学会当地民族语言以后，和当地少数民族人民的关系毫无疑问地会进一步密切起来；同时也说明了少数民族的干部和群众是如何地切盼汉族干部能学会他们的语言。
    当然，学会一种民族语言将会碰到许多困难，特别是目前编印教材、配备教员都存在着一定的困难，而且许多少数民族还没有本民族的文字，但我们只要有坚定的长期为少数民族服务的决心，苦学苦炼，埋头钻研下去，学习中一切困难都是可以克服的。汉族干部到少数民族地区工作，既然负有帮助兄弟民族发展的光荣任务，如果不会当地民族语言，宣传政策时人民群众听不懂，他们的愿望和要求反映不上来，这对完善地完成这项光荣任务不能不是一种阻碍。现在我们学习少数民族语言是有着许多有利条件的，首先是党和人民政府的支持；其次少数民族人民热烈欢迎我们这种学习，他们会热诚地给予帮助；我们有良好的学习环境，工作和空闲时间都随时有实用和练习的机会。在这些良好的条件和环境下，只要有决心，有信心，学会一种民族语言是完全可以办到的。今天本报发表的青海省牧业区工作的汉族干部学习藏族语言的事实就是很好的证明。他们不是经过短时间的学习，许多人都能说普通藏话了吗？
    现在许多在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部都已先后开始了当地民族语言的学习，而且已经有了显著成绩。有些地区已建立了学习的组织和正规的学习制度，有领导有计划地进行学习；而且领导干部带头参加和坚持学习。这些情况说明了在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，绝大多数都决心长期地、艰苦地、诚心诚意地为少数民族服务，这是非常可喜的现象。我们希望：学习已有相当基础的能够继续巩固和提高；已经开始学习的能够坚持下去；还没有开始学习的也迎头赶上去。
    有些地区，如新疆省和西康藏族自治区的少数民族干部，在汉族干部学习民族语言的鼓舞下，也自动地学习汉语、汉文，这是非常值得欢迎的。汉族干部应该热诚地帮助他们进行学习。汉族和少数民族干部在互相帮助学习语言的基础上，将更增进互相了解，进一步团结起来，共同建设各民族友爱合作的大家庭。
