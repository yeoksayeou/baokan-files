Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have entered a new period of development, which is a period of gradual transition to socialism. During this transition period, our country's general line is to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. This general line must be known to all the people, especially to the vast number of farmers. Because farmers account for more than 80% of our country's total population and are the largest majority of the people, the Party and the government must educate and lead them to participate in the great industrialization cause in accordance with the general line of the transition period, and transform the backward and scattered small-scale peasant economy into an advanced, cooperative, socialist agricultural economy according to the principle of voluntariness.

"The serious problem is to educate the peasants. The peasants' economy is scattered. According to the Soviet experience, it takes a long time and careful work to achieve agricultural socialization." This passage that Comrade Mao Zedong told us in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" is even more significant today.

Today, the land reform has been basically completed nationwide. The living conditions of farmers have improved compared to before the land reform. Agricultural production has exceeded the highest level before liberation. However, the current situation cannot meet the needs of farmers' own continued development, nor can it meet the country's needs for agriculture for industrialization. This situation cannot be stabilized, and in fact, it is unstable. It either develops towards capitalism, which means that a few people get rich by exploitation, the majority are exploited and impoverished, and agriculture remains backward and cannot keep up with the needs of the country; or it develops towards socialism, which means that all farmers can become rich, eliminate exploitation, and agriculture implements large-scale cooperative operations. With the help of the state, advanced technology is adopted, agriculture and socialist industry advance together, and become part of the entire socialist economy. The task of the Party and the government, the task of the working class and all advanced farmers, is to lead the farmers to take the socialist road. This task must be completed, because if the farmers do not move towards socialism, they will move towards capitalism. In this way, not only will the polarization between rich and poor among farmers develop rapidly, and agricultural production will lag behind the needs of industrial development; but also wealthy farmers will not sell grain and other agricultural products to the state for the state to supply workers, institutions, troops, urban residents, and rural households lacking food. On the contrary, wealthy farmers will sell grain and other agricultural products to speculative private merchants, allowing them to exploit the working people who buy grain, and allowing them to undermine the worker-peasant alliance and national construction.

In order to lead farmers to actively support the country's socialist industrialization and gradually complete socialist transformation in accordance with the country's general line of construction, it is necessary to conduct vigorous publicity to all farmers, so that every farmer understands the Party and the government's general line in the transition period and understands the necessity of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

Regarding the issue of socialist industrialization, many farmers do not easily understand what socialist industrialization is, what benefits national industrialization has for farmers, and what responsibilities farmers have for national industrialization. Therefore, it is necessary to tell the farmers in a popular and vivid way: Socialist industrialization is to transform China from an industrially underdeveloped country into an industrially developed country, and to transform non-socialist industry into socialist industry. This means on the one hand, to strive to build many new socialist state-owned factories and mines, to produce more steel, coal, oil, and electricity, and to manufacture more machines; on the other hand, to carry out socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry, so that they can thoroughly produce according to the needs of the entire people in accordance with the state plan. When the country realizes socialist industrialization, our country's industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, culture, education, and health undertakings can develop, national defense can be consolidated, and the lives of the people throughout the country can be fundamentally improved step by step, and the lives of farmers can also be fundamentally improved step by step. When the country's industry is developed, it can manufacture more new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery to help farmers develop large-scale socialist agricultural production, build more railways and highways to connect cities and rural areas, build more water conservancy projects to develop agriculture, and supply farmers with a large number of cheap daily necessities. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Chinese farmers have always been patriotic and have contributed to the revolution. National industrialization is of great benefit to farmers. Therefore, hundreds of millions of farmers must contribute great strength to the cause of industrial construction and unite closely with the working class to realize industrialization. The working class has already made great contributions to industrial construction and has brought many benefits to farmers. The walking plows, waterwheels, new-style fertilizers, insecticides, cloth, salt, sugar, kerosene, and many daily necessities used by farmers are all industrial products. The working class is continuing to work hard for industrialization. The task of the farmers is to strive to increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, and to sell the grain and other agricultural products needed by the state to the state, in addition to the portion they eat and use themselves. This is the farmer's great contribution to industrial construction.

Regarding the issue of the socialist transformation of agriculture, many farmers also do not easily understand why agriculture should implement socialist transformation, and how to implement socialist transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to tell the farmers in a popular and vivid way: On the one hand, because the country is being built, the urban population is increasing, and the lives of farmers are also improving, the demand for grain and other agricultural products is increasing year by year. If farmers do not implement large-scale production, they will definitely not be able to keep up with the needs of the country and the needs of the farmers themselves in the future, and the interests of national industrial construction and the interests of some farmers who want to make money by trading in agricultural products will conflict; on the other hand, if farmers do not unite to implement large-scale production, not only will rural life not be able to catch up with the cities, but also because of the vulnerability of the small-scale peasant economy itself and the development of capitalist exploitation, many farmers will definitely live in poverty. Implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture means allowing all laboring farmers to unite step by step, and use new farm tools and new farming methods to carry out large-scale agricultural production. This is beneficial to the country and all the people, and it is also beneficial to all the farmers. The method of uniting should be from small to large, from low-level to high-level, completely based on the voluntary will of the farmers. First, organize mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts; further organize and join semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives; in the future, we can further build fully socialist production cooperatives (that is, collective farms) and supply and marketing cooperatives, and realize collective production and prosperous lives. Farmers must understand that the socialist transformation of agriculture is not "eating from the same pot" or "eating and sleeping collectively," but working together and distributing according to labor. The income from labor, in addition to paying taxes and contributing to the public accumulation fund of the cooperative and seeking local public welfare, is for the enjoyment and use of each farmer's family. Whoever works the best will have the most income, and whoever lives the best life. The result of this is that everyone is prosperous, there are no poor people, and widows and orphans can also receive social care. Therefore, the socialist transformation of agriculture is the only bright path for all farmers.

Only by carrying out universal and in-depth publicity in all rural areas where land reform has been implemented can we mobilize the vast number of farmers to embark on the path of national industrialization and socialization together with the working class. Workers build in the cities, and farmers build in the countryside, so that the cities and countryside throughout the country develop and progress. This is the true worker-peasant alliance and the true patriotism.

In order to do this publicity work well, all localities should formulate plans, make full preparations, and conduct vigorous publicity during the slack farming season this winter and next spring, in conjunction with the work of grain requisition and purchase and the development of agricultural production cooperation. Before starting the publicity, we should summarize the past experiences and lessons in publicizing socialism and the worker-peasant alliance to the peasants, and avoid repeating the shortcomings of past work; during the work, we should conduct a systematic inspection at appropriate paragraphs (for example, when the grain purchase work is over and we are preparing to switch to publicizing mutual aid and cooperation); next spring, we should conduct a comprehensive summary of the publicity work this winter and next spring, and make new arrangements to systematize and regularize the political propaganda work in the rural areas in the future.

After opposing "five-excesses" in the countryside, some places even regarded political propaganda as superfluous and opposed it together. This is extremely wrong. Genuine "five-excesses" should be resolutely opposed, but it is a very necessary political task to carry out correct publicity and education to the peasant masses with correct methods. This is not too much in the countryside, but too little. As for the formalism and coercion in the past propaganda work, they must be overcome. The key issue here is to strengthen leadership, not to abolish it. Recently, some reporters in the countryside have not given reports for a long time, some propagandists do not know how to propagandize because they are not led, some blackboard newspapers and reading groups are not active, and the political education of many party branches has also stagnated. Some propaganda is also often limited to the current production technology and the direct needs of the country, without mentioning socialism, and sometimes even accommodating the spontaneous tendencies of the peasants, intentionally or unintentionally promoting capitalism. In this way, farmers have few opportunities to understand the various aspects of the country's construction period and the fundamental principles, and they do not understand what is correct and what is wrong, what is the personal and immediate interest and the long-term interest of the country, and what is the correct relationship between them. In this way, it is not easy to continue to improve the farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and political awareness, and it is easy to promote the development of the farmers' spontaneous capitalist tendencies. A few farmers only care about their own "standing out" and getting rich, and even hoarding grain, speculating, and lending money at high interest rates, seeking personal wealth at the expense of the masses. Some party members, because of lack of education, not only cannot fight against this capitalist tendency of a few farmers, but also follow the trend. Therefore, the party organizations in the rural areas must thoroughly correct the erroneous views that neglect ideological and political work, thoroughly rectify the propaganda and education work in the rural areas, first make the cadres and party members, and then make all patriotic farmers clear-headed, and resolutely advance towards socialism under the leadership of the Party.

In the past, some places did not have enough comprehensive publicity about socialism, and lacked correct explanations about the production, distribution, and other aspects of socialism, as well as the struggle process that must be experienced to realize socialism, which caused misunderstandings among some farmers, such as misunderstanding socialism as "returning to the big pile" or "eating from the same pot." In other places, propaganda workers are not good at starting from the farmers' own interests and practical experience, letting farmers understand the benefits of socialism from the benefits given by the state and the benefits of being organized, and only talk about the great principles that farmers are not easy to understand, and like to put big hats on farmers, so that the propaganda does not get the due effect. These shortcomings must be overcome in future publicity.

It should be pointed out that farmers are able to accept our propaganda. Facts have proved that the vast number of laboring farmers, after receiving correct publicity and education, have supported the calls of the Party and the government, both in the past and now. Farmers can accept socialism. This can be seen from the vigorous development of agricultural production cooperatives, and it can also be seen from the experience of farmers visiting the Soviet Union. These farmers have personally seen the prosperous lives of Soviet farmers under the socialist system, and have eliminated past misunderstandings about socialism, and are determined to learn from Soviet farmers. Farmers can let their personal immediate interests be subordinate to the country's long-term interests. Not to mention anything else, the current grain purchase propaganda has many vivid examples. After listening to the Party's propaganda, farmers in many places quickly sold the grain they did not want to sell. The following passage from Zheng Yuanqi, a farmer in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, is representative: "I was very difficult this spring. I couldn't borrow from others. Private grain prices were high, and the government's wheat price did not rise. The price of miscellaneous grains was even lower, which solved my food shortage problem. Now, if we don't sell wheat to the country, who will take care of us if we are short of food in the future?" He immediately sold four hundred catties of surplus grain to the state. There are many such examples in various provinces, and localities should collect and disseminate them.

Stalin said: "The peasant economy is not a capitalist economy. The peasant economy, in the vast majority of peasant households, is a small commodity economy. And what is the small commodity peasant economy? It is an economy standing at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. It can either develop towards capitalism, as is the case in capitalist countries today, or it can develop towards socialism, as is the case in our country, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat." ("Several Questions on Leninism") In today's situation in China, with the Soviet Union as our example, we are fully capable of guiding farmers on the road to socialism. We must guide the farmers at the crossroads of the peasant economy, not to take the wrong road of capitalism, but to take the bright road of socialism.

Vigorously publicizing the general line of the transition period to farmers is a great political work necessary for realizing the country's socialist industrialization, for realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Doing this work well is the basic guarantee for doing all rural work well.

### 必须大张旗鼓地向农民宣传过渡时期的总路线

    必须大张旗鼓地向农民
    宣传过渡时期的总路线
    从中华人民共和国成立的时候起，我国人民就走进了一个新的发展时期，这就是一步一步过渡到社会主义的时期。在这过渡时期中，我们国家的总路线，就是要逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造。这个总路线必须使全体人民都知道，特别是必须使广大农民都知道。因为农民占我国人口总数的百分之八十以上，是人民中的最大多数，党和政府必须教育和领导他们照着过渡时期的总路线来参加伟大的工业化事业，并且按自愿的原则把落后的分散的小农经济变为先进的合作化的社会主义农业经济。
    “严重的问题是教育农民。农民的经济是分散的，根据苏联的经验，需要很长的时间和细心的工作，才能做到农业社会化。”毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中告诉我们的这一段话，今天更加具有重大的意义了。
    今天土地改革在全国范围内已经基本上完成了。农民的生活状况比较土地改革以前已经有了进步。农业的生产已经超过了解放前的最高水平。但是目前的状况既不能满足农民自身继续发展的需要，也不能满足国家工业化对于农业的需要。这种状况是不能稳定的，事实上也是不稳定的。它或者是向资本主义发展，这就是少数人靠剥削而发财，多数人被剥削而穷困，农业仍然落后，赶不上国家的需要；或者是向社会主义发展，这就是全体农民都能富裕，消灭剥削，农业实行大规模的合作经营，在国家的帮助下采用先进的技术，农业和社会主义的工业一同前进，并且成为整个社会主义经济的一部分。党和政府的任务，工人阶级和一切先进农民的任务，就是领导农民走社会主义的道路。这个任务是必须完成的，因为农民如果不向着社会主义走，就要向着资本主义走。这样，不但农民中间的贫富分化就要迅速发展，农业生产就要落在工业发展的需要之后；而且富裕的农民就要不把粮食和其他农产品卖给国家，以便国家用来供给工人、机关、部队、城市居民和农村的缺粮户，相反，富裕的农民就要把粮食和其他农产品卖给投机的私商，让他们剥削买粮吃的劳动人民，让他们破坏工农联盟和国家建设。
    为着领导农民按照国家建设的总路线，积极支持国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成社会主义改造，就必须向全体农民群众进行大张旗鼓的宣传，使个个农民都懂得党和政府在过渡时期的总路线，懂得社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的必要。
    就社会主义工业化的问题来说，许多农民不容易了解究竟什么是社会主义工业化，国家工业化对于农民有什么好处，农民对于国家工业化有什么责任。因此就必须通俗地生动地告诉农民：社会主义工业化就是要使中国由工业不发达的国家变成工业发达的国家，要把非社会主义的工业变成社会主义的工业。这就是一方面要努力建设许多新的社会主义性质的国营工厂和矿山，多炼钢铁，多产煤炭、煤油和电力，多造机器；另一方面要把手工业和资本主义工业加以社会主义的改造，使它们能够彻底按照国家的计划，为全体人民的需要来进行生产。国家实现了社会主义工业化，我国的工业、农业、运输业、商业、文化教育卫生事业才能发达，国防才能巩固，全国人民的生活才能一步一步地根本改善，农民的生活也才能一步一步地根本改善。国家的工业发达了，才能多造新式农具和农业机器，来帮助农民发展大规模的社会主义的农业生产，才能多修铁路和公路把城市和农村联接起来，才能多修水利来发展农业，才能用大量便宜的各种日用东西来供给农民。我国农民在共产党和毛主席领导下向来是爱国的，对革命有功的，国家工业化又对农民有极大的好处，因此几万万农民在工业建设的事业中一定要贡献伟大的力量，和工人阶级亲密联合起来实现工业化。现在工人阶级在工业建设中已经做了很大的贡献，并且使农民得到了许多好处；农民使用的步犁、水车、新式肥料、杀虫药械、布匹、盐、糖、煤油和许多日用品就都是工业的生产品。工人阶级正在继续为着工业化艰苦奋斗。农民的任务，就是努力增产粮食和其他农产品，并且除了自吃自用的一部分以外，把国家所需要的粮食等农产品卖给国家。这就是农民对于工业建设的伟大贡献。
    就农业的社会主义改造问题来说，许多农民也不容易了解究竟农业为什么要实行社会主义改造，要怎样实行社会主义改造。因此就必须通俗地生动地告诉农民：在一方面，因为全国建设了，城市人口增加了，农民的生活也提高了，需要的粮食和其他农产品一年年增加，农民如果不实行大规模生产，将来一定赶不上国家的需要和农民自己的需要，并且使国家工业建设的利益和一部分农民想靠农产品做生意赚钱的利益发生冲突；在另一方面，农民不联合起来实行大规模生产，不但农村的生活不可能赶上城市，而且因为小农经济本身的脆弱和资本主义剥削的发展，一定会有很多农民生活穷困。实行农业的社会主义改造，就是让所有的劳动农民都一步一步地联合起来，用新的农具和新的耕作法来进行大规模的农业生产，这样既对于国家和全体人民有利，也对于全体农民有利。联合的办法由小到大，由低级到高级，完全根据农民的自愿。先组织带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组；进一步组织和加入半社会主义的农业生产合作社和供销合作社；将来就可以再进一步建设完全社会主义性质的生产合作社（就是集体农场）和供销合作社，实现集体的生产和富裕的生活。必须使农民明白：实行农业的社会主义改造，完全不是什么“吃大锅饭”“集体吃饭集体睡觉”，而是共同劳动，按劳分配，劳动所得除了纳税、缴合作社的公积金和谋当地的公共福利以外，都归农民各家各人自享自用，谁劳动得最好，谁的收入就最多，谁的日子过得最好。这样的结果是大家富裕，没有穷人，鳏寡孤独也能够得到社会的照顾。所以，实行农业的社会主义改造乃是全体农民的唯一光明大路。
    只有在全国所有已经实行土地改革的农村中普遍地深入地进行宣传，我们才能把广大农民动员起来，和工人阶级一起走上国家工业化和社会主义化的轨道。工人在城市里建设，农民在农村里建设，使全国的城市农村都发展，都进步，这才是真正的工农联盟，才是真正的爱国。
    为了做好这个宣传工作，各地都应该订出计划，充分准备，在今冬明春的农闲期间，配合着征粮购粮的工作和发展农业生产合作的工作，大张旗鼓地进行。在开始宣传以前，应该总结过去关于向农民宣传社会主义和工农联盟的经验教训，避免重复过去工作中的缺点；在工作中间，应该在适当的段落（例如在购粮工作结束，准备转入宣传互助合作的时候）作一次系统的检查；在明年春季，应该对今冬明春的宣传工作作一次全面的总结，作出新的布置，使今后的农村中的政治宣传工作系统化，经常化。
    在农村中反对“五多”以后，有的地方竟把政治宣传也当成多余的事情，一起反掉了。这是极端错误的。真正的“五多”应当坚决反对，但用正确的方法向农民群众进行正确的宣传教育，却是十分必要的政治工作，这在农村中不是多了，而是少了。至于过去宣传工作中的形式主义和强迫命令现象必须克服，这里的关键问题是加强领导，而不是加以取消。近来有的农村里的报告员很长时间不做报告了，有的宣传员没有人领导也不知道怎么宣传了，有的黑板报、读报组也不活动了，许多党的支部的政治教育也停顿了。有的宣传，也往往限于当前的生产技术和国家的直接需要，言不及社会主义，有时甚至迁就农民的自发倾向，有意无意地宣传资本主义。这样就使农民很少有机会了解国家建设时期的各方面情况和根本的大道理，弄不清楚什么是正确的和什么是错误的，什么是个人的眼前的利益和国家的长远的利益，什么是它们之间的正确的关系。这样就不容易继续提高农民的爱国热情和政治觉悟，这样就容易助长农民的自发的资本主义倾向的发展，少数农民就只顾自己“冒尖”发财，甚至囤积粮食，投机倒把，高利放债，用牺牲群众的办法来求个人发财。有的党员因为缺少教育，不但不能和少数农民的这种资本主义倾向作斗争，而且随波逐流。因此，农村中的党组织必须彻底纠正那些忽视思想政治工作的错误观点，彻底整顿农村中的宣传教育工作，首先使干部和党员，然后使全体爱国农民都头脑清醒起来，在党的领导下坚决向社会主义前进。
    过去有的地方关于社会主义的宣传不够全面，对于社会主义的生产、分配等方面以及实现社会主义所必经的奋斗过程缺乏正确的说明，以致引起部分农民群众的误会，比如把社会主义误解成了“归大堆”、“吃大锅饭”。还有的地方，宣传工作人员不善于从农民的切身利益和实际经验出发，让农民从国家所给的好处和组织起来的好处认识到社会主义的好处，光是讲农民所不容易了解的大道理，并且好给农民戴上这样那样的大帽子，因而使宣传得不到应有的效果。这些缺点在今后的宣传中必须加以克服。
    应当指出，农民是能够接受我们的宣传的。事实证明，广大的劳动农民受到正确的宣传教育之后，无论在过去和现在，对于党和政府的号召都是拥护的。农民能够接受社会主义。这可以从农业生产合作社的蓬勃发展看出来，也可以从农民访问苏联的经验看出来，这些农民亲眼看到了苏联农民在社会主义制度下的富裕生活，都消除了过去对于社会主义的误解，决心要向苏联农民学习。农民能够让个人的眼前利益服从国家的长远利益。旁的不说，单是目前的购粮宣传就有很多生动的例子。许多地方的农民在听了党的宣传以后，很快就把原来不想卖的粮食卖出了。山西平陆县的农民郑元起的这一段话是有代表性的：“今年春天我很困难，向别人借都借不到，私人粮价高，公家的小麦没涨价，杂粮价更低，才把我的缺粮问题解决了。现在我们要不卖给国家小麦，将来缺粮谁来管呢？”他立刻把四百斤余粮卖给了国家。这样的例子各省都很多，各地应当收集起来，加以传播。
    斯大林说：“农民经济并不是资本主义经济。农民经济按绝大多数农户来说，是小商品经济。而小商品农民经济又是什么呢？它是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济。它既可能发展到资本主义方面去，如现在资本主义国家里的情形那样，也可能发展到社会主义方面去，如在我们国家里，在无产阶级专政条件下所要发生的情形一样。”（“论列宁主义的几个问题”）在我们中国今天的情况下，有了苏联做我们的榜样，我们完全能够引导农民走社会主义的路。我们要在农民经济的十字路口上，指引农民不走资本主义的错路，而走社会主义的光明大路。
    大张旗鼓地向农民宣传过渡时期的总路线，是为实现国家的社会主义工业化、为实现对农业的社会主义改造、为巩固工农联盟所必需的伟大政治工作。做好这项工作是做好一切农村工作的基本保证。
