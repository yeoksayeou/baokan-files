　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Responsible personnel and cadres of the central leading organs of the Chinese democratic parties have successively begun to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period.

　　Since the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the 24th to 28th meetings of the Central People's Government in mid-September, the persons in charge of the democratic parties have conveyed the general line and general task of the state during the transition period in their respective central leading organs. On October 10, Li Weihan, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, gave a report on the transmission of the general line of the state during the transition period. The central leading organs of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League successively began to study the general line.

　　The central leading organs of the democratic parties have formulated study plans and established specialized institutions to lead the study. In addition to requiring an in-depth understanding of the specific content of the general line of the state during the transition period, the plan also requires understanding the importance of continuing to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and continuing ideological remolding during the transition period, as well as clarifying how to strengthen the work of the democratic parties in accordance with the general line.

　　Most of the personnel from the central leading organs of the democratic parties who participated in the study were able to earnestly conduct self-study and seriously engage in discussions. Some democratic party members living in the western suburbs of Beijing came to the city on time to participate in collective study or discussion each time. During the discussions, many central leaders of the democratic parties made central speeches at the meetings. After preliminary discussions and forums, the responsible persons and cadres of the central leading organs of the democratic parties have gradually recognized the great significance of the general line of the state during the transition period, recognizing that the general line is a beacon illuminating all tasks, and also a beacon illuminating the work of the democratic parties. In the future, they must better carry out their work in accordance with the state's general line. Some personnel from the leading organs of democratic parties, in the course of discussions, also helped each other to criticize some confused understandings and erroneous thoughts that were not in line with the state's general line. Some people realized during the forums that the process of studying the general line is the process of ideological remolding, and only by striving to remold oneself can one contribute to the country and the people.

　　Currently, the study of the general line by the central leading organs of the democratic parties is being further deepened and expanded.

　　各民主党派中央领导机关订出计划
    认真学习国家过渡时期总路线
    【新华社十五日讯】中国各民主党派中央领导机关的负责人员和干部，已先后开始学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。
    自从九月中旬中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会扩大会议和中央人民政府委员会第二十四次至第二十八次会议以后，各民主党派负责人便分别在其中央领导机关传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。十月十日，中国人民政协全国委员会李维汉秘书长作了关于国家过渡时期总路线的传达报告，中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟等民主党派中央领导机关便陆续开始了关于总路线的学习。
    各民主党派中央领导机关都拟订了学习计划和建立了专门领导学习的机构。计划中除了要求深入了解国家在过渡时期总路线的具体内容以外，并要求了解在过渡时期继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线、继续进行思想改造的重要性，以及明确如何根据总路线加强各民主党派的工作等问题。
    各民主党派中央领导机关参加学习的人员，大都能够认真地进行自学，严肃地展开讨论。有些住在北京西郊的民主党派人士，每次都按时进城来参加集体学习或讨论。在讨论中，许多民主党派的中央负责人在会上作了中心发言。经过初步讨论和座谈以后，各民主党派中央领导机关负责人员和干部已逐步认识国家过渡时期总路线的重大意义，认识总路线是照耀各项工作的灯塔，同样也是照耀各民主党派工作的灯塔，今后必须根据国家总路线更好地进行工作。有此民主党派领导机关的人员在讨论中，并相互帮助，批判了一些不符合国家总路线的糊涂认识和错误思想。有些人在座谈时体会到：学习总路线的过程就是思想改造的过程，只有努力改造自己，才会对国家对人民有所贡献。
    现在，各民主党派中央领导机关关于总路线的学习正在进一步深入展开。
