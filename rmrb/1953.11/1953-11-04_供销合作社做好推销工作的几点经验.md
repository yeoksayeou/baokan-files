Several Experiences of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Doing a Good Job in Promotion Work
Qiu Jian, Secretary of the Hailun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In order to respond to and implement the call of the Party Central Committee on increasing production and practicing strict economy, the Hailun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Heilongjiang Province, in addition to strengthening the leadership of industrial and agricultural production, particularly focused on the leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises, requiring them to vigorously carry out winter supply and marketing work to meet the needs of the people's lives and support agricultural production, and strive to overfulfill the annual sales plan.

There are a total of one hundred and twenty-nine supply and marketing cooperatives in Hailun County. Seventy-six cooperatives overfulfilled the supply and marketing plan in the third quarter. Among them, the Lusheng Village Cooperative in the Seventeenth District overfulfilled the original plan by 185.3 percent. Most other cooperatives generally completed the plan, but some individual cooperatives, such as the Aizheng Village Cooperative in the Fifteenth District, only completed 37.83 percent of the original plan. On October 2, we convened a county-wide meeting of district and village supply and marketing cooperative directors. Responsible comrades from various state-owned trading companies at the county level and district heads also participated in this meeting. At the meeting, we focused on reviewing the work of each grassroots cooperative and introduced advanced experiences, which created good conditions for doing a good job in winter supply and marketing work. From the perspective of grassroots cooperatives that have completed the plan relatively well, the following experiences are gained in doing a good job in promotion work:

First, the cooperative must closely combine striving for the leadership of the Party and government, giving play to the role of the members' representative meeting, and the efforts of the grassroots cooperative cadres. The Zhicheng Village Cooperative in the Eighth District initially failed to complete its task of pre-purchasing grain for the state and its own sales tasks due to the bureaucratic style of leadership and the shop assistants waiting for customers. Later, a meeting of members' representatives was convened to review the work. Following this, a meeting of the board of directors was convened, at which it was decided to ask the Party branch secretary and the village head to convene mass meetings in separate villages to explain the benefits of farmers actively selling grain to the country and to themselves. As a result, the total value of grain purchase contracts reached 12 million yuan within three days. At this time, the cooperative cadres were both signing grain purchase contracts and vigorously promoting the sale of cloth, thus selling 15 million yuan worth of goods while signing grain purchase contracts.

Second, understand the needs of the masses and actively purchase goods according to the needs of the masses. When making a purchasing plan, the Huzhu Village Cooperative in the Third District first investigated the population, land, and livestock numbers within the cooperative's scope, as well as the quantity and quality of items needed by the masses in different seasons, and then purchased goods according to the plan. For example, when they saw that the masses needed to build houses, they bought nails; when the masses needed to cultivate the land, they bought hoes, thus ensuring the source of goods and meeting the needs of the masses. The sales task of the Huzhu Village Cooperative in the Third District in the third quarter was 472.5 million yuan. Because the purchase of goods was based on the needs of the masses, the promotion plan was overfulfilled by 16.7 percent in the first, second, and third quarters.

Third, give full play to the wisdom of the masses. The shop assistants of the cloth group of the Huzhu Village Cooperative in the Third District, after studying and processing the more than 400 feet of cloth remnants that had been accumulated for a long time, made shirts out of the pieces large enough for shirts and pants out of the pieces large enough for pants, and as a result, all the more than 400 feet of cloth remnants were sold. Shop assistant Wu Yabin first tried making a mattress cover out of more than 300 feet of small floral cloth that had been accumulated since 1951. It was sturdy and beautiful, which aroused the masses' interest, and therefore it was quickly sold. In this way, dead stock was turned into live stock. All cooperatives that did this overfulfilled the sales plan.

Fourth, when bringing goods to the countryside, it is necessary to correct the practice of only focusing on selling to households living in large houses, and at the same time, pay attention to selling more in marginal villages and hamlets. In the past, cadres of the Yongxing Village Cooperative in the Eighth District only went to large houses to sell when carrying backpacks to the countryside, believing that households with large houses, shiny glass, and clean courtyards had money. As a result, the pool of buyers was narrow and the money earned was small. Later, the cooperative director adopted the method of "rather pulling a village than pulling a door," and when he went to an old Sun's house, although the house was small and the glass was not shiny, he needed cloth for the change of seasons. As a result, he bought 3.6 million yuan worth of goods from his household alone. Old Sun said: "If you hadn't come, I was going to buy cloth in Gaoxian District, Wangkui County. Since you came, I'll buy from you. In the past, cooperative cadres never came to our door when they went to the countryside. You didn't come to the wrong door this time." Cadres of the Xinmin Cooperative in the Fourth District carried goods to the countryside and went to Zihjia and other two hamlets (with more than 60 households) that no one had gone to in the past. The masses liked it and sold a lot of goods. As a result, the Xinmin Cooperative overfulfilled the sales plan by 145 percent in the first, second, and third quarters.

Fifth, combine promotion with understanding the needs of the masses, and combine delivering goods to the door with purchasing local and sideline products. After the cadres of the Fengle Village Cooperative in the Sixth District brought cloth to the countryside and the masses bought the cloth, they requested that oil and salt be delivered to their homes. The cooperative cadres returned to the cooperative and transported oil and salt. Later, the masses requested glass and large baskets, so they transported eight boxes of glass and more than one hundred large baskets, which promptly met the needs of the masses. Some villagers said: "The cadres led by the Communist Party really think thoughtfully for us." Two people from the Sihe Village Cooperative in the Tenth District went to the countryside, one to sell goods and the other to purchase local and sideline products. As a result, they sold an average of 1.25 million yuan worth of goods every day.

Sixth, the cooperative actively improves its operation and management. The "four-member contact" contract method of the Fengle Village Cooperative in the Sixth District and the Lusheng Village Cooperative in the Seventeenth District is a better method for improving the operation and management of cooperatives at present. The "four-member contact" contract method is as follows: The shop assistant proposes: 1. Do not allow goods to be stockpiled for a long time; 2. According to the needs of the members, ensure that there is no shortage of goods that state-owned trading companies have; 3. Do not purchase goods blindly; 4. Do not let buyers run in vain, and strengthen publicity; The purchasing agent proposes: 1. Ensure that the quality of the goods is good and meets the needs of the members; 2. Ensure that the quantity of goods sent home is not short; 3. Ensure that the goods are handled in a timely manner; 4. Ensure that a good sales channel for local and sideline products is found; 5. Ensure that the accounts are settled in a timely manner when returning home; The accountant proposes: 1. Concentrate all financial resources; 2. Regularly check the implementation of business operations; 3. Supply funds in a timely manner; 4. Resolutely implement the financial and accounting system; The purchasing agent proposes: 1. Do not stockpile the local and sideline products purchased and ensure that they are sent out in a timely manner; 2. The local and sideline products purchased must not be short in quantity or deteriorate in quality; 3. Do not mix grades and store them separately. In this way, each person sets their own requirements as work standards and carries out competition with each other. The cooperative's leadership proposes: Go deep into the masses and understand the situation; Do a good job of investigating the needs of the masses; Check and summarize the work on time (every seven days) and promptly promote the experience.

    供销合作社做好推销工作的几点经验
    中共海伦县委书记　邱健
    为了响应和执行党中央关于增加生产厉行节约的号召，中共黑龙江海伦县委除了加强工农业生产领导外，特别着重对国营商业和合作社商业的领导，要求它们大力做好冬季供销工作，以满足人民生活需要和支持农业生产，并争取超额完成全年销售计划。
    海伦全县共有一百二十九个供销社，第三季度内超额完成供销计划的有七十六个社，其中十七区禄生村社超额完成原计划百分之一百八十五点三，其他社一般的都完成了计划，也有个别社如十五区爱政村社只完成原计划的百分之三十七点八三。十月二日，我们召开了全县区、村供销社主任会议，县级各国营贸易公司负责同志和各区区长也都参加了这次会议，在会议上，我们着重检查了各基层社的工作，同时介绍了先进经验，这为做好冬季供销工作创造了良好条件。从完成计划较好的基层社来看，做好推销工作有如下经验：
    第一，合作社必须把争取党政领导、发挥社员代表会作用，和基层社干部的努力密切结合。八区志承村社起初由于领导上官僚主义，营业员守门等客，代国家预购粮食和自己的销售任务都没有完成。后来召开了社员代表大会，对工作进行了检查；随着召开了理事会，在理事会上决定请党支部书记和村长召开分屯群众会，讲解农民踊跃卖粮对国家和对自己的好处。结果三天内，购粮合同的总值达一千二百万元。合作社干部这时候就一边订购粮合同，一边大力推销布匹，因此在订购粮合同的同时，卖货达一千五百万元。
    第二，了解群众需要，根据群众需要积极进货。三区互助村社在作进货计划时，先调查了社范围内的人口、土地、牲畜数量，和不同季节群众需要物品的数量、质量等，这样就按计划进货。如看到群众要盖房子，就买进钉子；群众要铲地，就买进锄头，因此保证了货源，满足了群众需要。三季度三区互助村社的销售任务是四亿七千二百五十万元，由于进货是根据群众需要，因此一、二、三季度都超额完成推销计划百分之十六点七。
    第三，充分发挥群众智慧。三区互助村社布匹组的店员，把历来积压的四百多尺布头，经过研究加工，够做衬衣的做衬衣，够做裤?的做裤?，结果四百多尺布头都卖了出去。店员吴亚彬把一九五一年积压到现在的三百多尺小花布，先试做了一个褥面，结实、美观，引起群众喜欢，因此很快就销掉了。就这样把死货变成活货。凡这样做的社都超额完成了销售计划。
    第四，带货下乡，要纠正只着重向大房子住户推销的做法，同时要注意多去边沿村屯推销。八区永兴村社干部，过去背包下乡只奔大房子推销，认为房大、玻璃光、院里干净的住户就有钱，结果买主的面很窄，卖钱也少，后来社主任采取了“宁拉一屯不拉一门”的作法，到了一家老孙家，他住房虽小，玻璃也不光，但是需要布换季，结果他一户就买了三百六十万元的货，老孙说：“你要不来，我准备到望奎县高贤区去买布，你来了就买你的，以前合作社干部下乡都不到俺这门里来，你这次可没走错了门。”四区新民合作社干部背货下乡，到了过去谁也不去的訾家等两个屯（有六十余户），群众喜欢，卖货很多，结果新民合作社一、二、三季度都超额完成销售计划的百分之一百四十五。
    第五，推销和了解群众需要相结合，送货到门和收购土、副产品相结合。六区丰乐村社干部背布下乡，群众买了布后，提出需要油盐到家，合作社干部就回社运来了油盐，后来群众又提出了需要玻璃和大筐，因此又运来了玻璃八箱和大筐一百余个，及时满足了群众的需要，有些老乡说：“共产党领导的干部真为我们想得周到。”十区四合村社二人下乡，一人卖货，另一人收购土、副产品，结果平均每天卖货一百二十五万元。
    第六，合作社积极改善经营管理。六区丰乐村社和十七区禄生村社两个村社的“四员联系”合同办法，是目前合作社改善经营管理中的较好办法。“四员联系”合同的办法是：营业员提出：一、不使商品长期积压，二、根据社员需要，凡国营贸易公司有的保证不缺货，三、不盲目进货，四、不让买主空跑，加强宣传；采购员提出：一、保证货的质量好，合乎社员需要，二、保证货的数量发回家不差，三、保证按时把货办回家，四、保证找好土副产品销路，五、保证回家把账及时算清；会计员提出：一、要集中一切资金力量，二、要按时检查业务执行情况，三、要及时供应资金，四、要坚决执行财政会计制度；收购员提出：一、不积压收购回来的土副产品，保证按时发出去，二、收购回来的土、副产品不差量不变质，三、不混同等级，分等保管。这样各按各的要求为工作标准，互相展开竞赛。社的领导上则提出：深入群众、了解情况；作好调查群众需要工作；按时（七天）检查和总结工作，把经验及时推广。
