The Fujian Provincial Company of the China Department Store transported more than 2,000 tons of industrial products to various grain-producing areas in October, so that farmers could buy the goods they needed in a timely manner after selling their surplus grain.

As early as August, the Fujian Provincial Company had signed several transaction contracts with central wholesale stations, wholesale stations in various provinces and cities, and local state-owned specialized companies. In key areas of the province, it also processed, purchased, and sold some local industrial and handicraft products. At the beginning of October, the company instructed department stores in various places to continue to vigorously organize sources of goods and to transport materials in a timely manner for supply. At the same time, it strengthened the inspection of contracts, urged delivery, accelerated transshipment, and timely distribution at the company's Shanghai Office and transfer stations in Nanchang, Shangrao, and Hecun in Jiangxi Province, Shantou and Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province. After a month of efforts, a large number of commodities have been transferred from Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shantou, Chongqing, Shenyang, Changchun and other places, and then transferred by the Fuzhou and Quanzhou wholesale stations and the Jianyang Central Store to the northern Fujian mountain area, the western Fujian Longyan old area, the downstream grain producing area of the Minjiang River, and the Jinjiang and Jiulong River basin grain producing areas. In addition, a batch of goods was transferred from Wenzhou, Zhejiang to the northeast of Fujian Province. A total of more than 2,000 tons of industrial products such as cotton, cloth, cotton sweaters, wool yarn, thermos bottles, rubber shoes, matches, kerosene, and stationery have been or are being transported to rural areas to supply farmers' needs.

In this transportation of industrial products to the countryside, the Fujian Provincial Department Store made full preparations and strengthened contact with relevant departments such as taxation, transportation, and delivery. Internal warehouse, price, supply, allocation, and transportation departments also cooperated closely to ensure that goods were transported to sales units in a timely manner. The Quanzhou Department Store Wholesale Station also held a special meeting to organize professional groups to strengthen transportation work, and even did not stop transportation on National Day and Sundays, to ensure that farmers in grain-producing areas could buy industrial products in a timely manner. The Fuzhou Department Store Wholesale Station and the Fuzhou Department Store established a "Five-Member Office" to uniformly lead the work of warehouse staff and allocation staff related to the transportation of goods, thereby greatly shortening the delivery time.

At present, wholesale stations in various places under the company are continuing to expand the organization of sources of goods and improve transportation work to ensure that industrial products are continuously sent to the countryside. For example, the goods purchased by the Jianyang Department Store Central Store are unpacked, sorted, and packaged at the station of origin, and then directly sent to the sales units in various places. The goods sent to the Jianyang Department Store Central Store's store are also directly transferred from the Jianyang Station to the store. This not only speeds up the delivery work, but also saves a lot of transfer fees.

### 福建省百货公司调运两千多吨工业品下乡

    福建省百货公司调运两千多吨工业品下乡
    中国百货公司福建省公司在十月份内及时调运了两千余吨工业品到各产粮区，使农民卖出余粮后，能及时买进他们所需要的货物。
    福建省百货公司早在八月间就和中央各批发站、各省市批发站和各地国营专业公司签订了数件交易合同，并在省内重点地区对部分地方工业和手工业的产品进行加工、收购和包销。十月初，该公司指示各地百货商店一面继续大力组织货源，一面要及时调运物资进行供应。同时对该公司所属上海办事处和江西省南昌、上饶、贺村，广东汕头、广州，浙江温州等地转运站，加强检查合同、催促发货、加速转运、及时分运。经过一个月来的努力，已从上海、天津、广州、汕头、重庆、沈阳、长春等地调来大批商品，再由福州、泉州批发站和建阳中心商店及时调运到闽北山区、闽西龙岩老区、闽江下游产粮区和晋江、九龙江流域产粮区。此外，还由浙江温州调进一批货物到闽东北地区。共计已有两千余吨的棉花、布匹、棉毛衫、羊毛线、热水瓶、胶鞋、火柴、煤油、文具等工业品，已经或正要运到农村供应农民需要。
    这次调运工业品下乡，福建省百货公司曾做了充分的准备与税务、运输、发货等有关部门加强联系，内部仓库、物价、供应、调拨、运输等部门也密切配合，保证货物及时调运到销货单位。泉州百货批发站还专门召开会议，组织专业小组加强调运工作，甚至连国庆节、星期日都没有停止调运，保证产粮区农民能够及时买到工业品。福州百货批发站与福州百货商店成立“五员办公室”，统一领导有关调运货物的仓库员、调拨员等工作，因此大大缩短了货物运送时间。
    目前该公司所属各地批发站正在继续扩大组织货源和改进调运工作，保证工业品源源下乡。如建阳百货中心商店所采办的货物，在产地车站就开箱、配货、分装，然后直接发给各地销货单位，其中发给建阳百货中心商店门市部的货物，也从建阳车站上直接调拨到门市部去。这样不但加速了发货工作，而且节省了不少的转运费。
