Central government organs, in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, have actively responded to the call to practice streamlining and economy, and reduce administrative expenses, achieving considerable results. In addition to streamlining administrative structures and tightening staffing, most organs have launched top-down inspections of administrative expenditure based on the spirit of streamlining and economy. They have re-formulated their expenditure plans for the fourth quarter, resolutely cutting those expenses that can be cut, postponed, or are optional. According to available information, the units under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have reduced construction and equipment costs by 5 billion to 6 billion yuan. The State Planning Commission has reduced equipment procurement costs by 573.3 million yuan. The Supervision Committee has stopped installing heating and reduced equipment procurement costs by 900 million yuan. The Political and Legal Committee has reduced equipment procurement costs by 843.3 million yuan. The Nationalities Affairs Commission has reduced equipment procurement costs for the fourth quarter by 57.4 million yuan. The Higher Education Department has stopped installing heating and reduced furniture procurement costs by over 900 million yuan. The Ministry of Culture has reduced expenditure for the fourth quarter by 200 million yuan.

    In addition to significantly reducing temporary expenses, some departments are actively seeking ways to save on recurring expenses. For example, the originally approved office expenses for the Ministry of Foreign Trade were 85,000 yuan per person per month, which has now been reduced to 75,000 yuan, a decrease of 11.77%. The originally approved monthly fuel consumption for vehicles was 40 gallons for large trucks, which has now been reduced to 35 gallons, and from 30 gallons to 25 gallons for small cars. Some organs are also clearing inventory to utilize or dispose of materials, in order to reduce state expenditures. At present, the campaign to streamline administrative structures and save administrative expenses in central administrative organs is continuing to deepen.

    中央各机关紧缩开支收到初步效果
    中央级各机关，在增产节约运动中，积极响应号召，厉行精简节约，缩减行政费开支，已获得相当成效。各机关除精简行政机构，紧缩编制外，大部机关均开展了自上而下的对紧缩行政经费的检查，根据精简节约精神，重新拟定了第四季度的开支计划，坚决削减了那些可以削减的，可以推迟的，及可办可不办的费用。就现在已有的情况，中共中央所属各单位已紧缩修建、设备等费用五十亿至六十亿元，国家计划委员会紧缩购置设备费用五亿七千三百万元。监察委员会停装暖气并减少购置设备费九亿元，政治法律委员会紧缩购置设备费八亿四千三百万元，民族事务委员会紧缩第四季度购置设备费五亿七千四百万元，高等教育部停装暖气和减少家具购置费九亿余元，文化部紧缩第四季度开支两亿元。有些部门除大量缩减临时性费用外，并积极想办法，节约经常性费用。如对外贸易部办公费原核定每人每月八万五千元，现降为七万五千元，即减少了百分之十一点七七；汽车每月用油原核定大卡车四十加仑，现降为三十五加仑，小汽车由三十加仑降为二十五加仑。有些机关并正清理库存物资，加以利用或处理，以减少国库的开支。目前中央级各行政机关精简行政机构与节约行政经费开支运动，正在继续深入开展中。
