Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 4th: The famous Northeast soybeans and sorghum have been widely available in the southern and northern regions. The autumn grain in Northeast China came on the market later this year. Sorghum and soybeans in the southern and northern regions were successively put on the market in mid-September and early October. Since mid-October, the amount of autumn grain on the market has been rising daily. In late October, the average daily purchase volume in the entire region reached 9,000 tons, an increase of 13% compared with mid-October. This year, the state has rationally adjusted grain prices and quality standards, which has been supported by the vast number of farmers. Many farmers, while busy threshing, sell the threshed new grain to the state to purchase production and daily necessities.

The output of miscellaneous grains in Northeast China ranks first in the country, and sorghum and soybeans are well-known throughout the country. Due to the abundant grain production, farmers sell a large amount of grain every year. This year, due to the development of the production increase and thrift movement in rural areas, farmers have paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing to increase the harvest volume in the autumn harvest, and have begun to pay attention to saving grain. It is estimated that the amount of grain sold in rural areas of Northeast China will increase this year. At the same time, Northeast China will also transport a large amount of miscellaneous grains to cotton-producing areas and other regions across the country to adjust the food supply of the local people.

In order to take care of the interests of farmers and increase their income, Northeast China adjusted the prices of some industrial products and grains before the start of grain purchases this year, further narrowing the price difference between industrial and agricultural products. The prices of Qingxi cloth, fancy serge, and indanthrene blue cloth, which rural women love to wear, were reduced by 4.4% to 5.5% respectively, the price of bamboo shell thermos bottles was reduced by 10.72%, and the price of soap was reduced by 7.23% to 13%. State-owned trading departments are also preparing to lower the prices of certain agricultural production materials. At the same time, the purchase price of grain has also been increased. The purchase price of sorghum, the main grain in the entire region, has increased by 13% compared with last year. This year, farmers can buy about three bolts of Bai Wufu cloth for selling one ton of sorghum, which is 0.37 bolts more than before the grain price adjustment.

Before the start of grain purchases, grain departments in various parts of Northeast China conducted education on grain purchase policies for all personnel, strengthened the mass viewpoint of grain purchase personnel, and provided various business and technical training to grain receiving personnel in order to accurately inspect the quality of grain during grain purchases. Various advanced experiences in simplifying purchase procedures and improving work efficiency have been widely promoted in various places. The method of using two grain transport iron carts traveling on rails for cyclical weighing has been adopted, which has increased the weighing efficiency by more than two times. State-owned grain companies and rural supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have universally signed grain purchase contracts. The organization and planning of grain purchase work have been strengthened. Heating rooms with dedicated personnel have been universally established at various grain purchase stations, and some have installed loudspeakers or radios to report state affairs and grain purchase policies or play music to farmers. Directional personnel or signs have been set up in the grain yard. Local CPC committees and government departments have also organized and established large cart inns for farmers transporting grain, with cheap meals available. These have all made farmers feel satisfied.

    东北区购粮工作普遍展开
    【新华社沈阳四日电】著名的东北大豆和高粱在南部和北部各地已普遍上市。东北区秋粮今年上市较晚。九月中旬和十月上旬南部地区和北部地区的高粱、大豆先后上市。十月中旬以来秋粮上市量逐日上升，十月下旬全区每天平均收购量已达九千吨，比中旬提高了百分之十三。国家今年合理地调整了粮食价格和质量标准，受到广大农民的拥护，许多农民一面忙着打场，一面就把打好的新粮卖给国家，添置生产和生活用品。
    东北区杂粮产量居全国第一位，高粱、大豆名闻全国。由于粮产丰富，每年农民都有大批粮食出售。今年由于农村开展了增产节约运动，农民在秋收中注意细收细打提高收获量，并且开始注意了节约粮食，估计今年东北农村出售粮食的数量将有增加。同时，东北区也将有大批杂粮运往全国棉花产区和其他地区，调剂当地人民的食粮。
    为了照顾农民利益，提高农民收入，东北区今年在购粮开始前调整了一部分工业品和粮食的价格，进一步缩小了工农业产品的差价。青细布、花哔叽和农村妇女们爱穿的阴丹士林蓝布的价格分别降低了百分之四点四到五点五，竹壳热水瓶的价格降低了百分之十点七二，肥皂的价格降低了百分之七点二三到百分之十三。国营贸易部门并准备降低某些农业生产资料的价格。与此同时，也提高了粮食的收购价格，全区的主粮高粱收购价格比去年提高了百分之十三。今年农民卖一吨高粱，就可买到三匹左右白五福布，比粮价调整前多买点三七匹。
    东北区各地粮食部门曾在购粮开始前，对全体人员进行了购粮政策的教育，加强了购粮人员的群众观点。并对接收粮食人员进行了各种业务、技术训练，以便购粮时把粮食的质量检验准确。各地还普遍推广了几种简化收购手续提高工作效率的先进经验，采用两台在铁轨上行走的运粮铁车循环过秤的方法，使过秤效率提高了两倍以上。各地国营粮食公司和农村供销合作社普遍订立了购粮合同。购粮工作的组织性和计划性已经加强。各购粮站普遍设立了有专人照顾的取暖室，有的并安设了扩音器或收音机，向农民报告国家大事和购粮政策或放送乐曲。在粮场内设了指路人员或标志物等。各地方中共党委和政府部门并为送粮农民组织与建立了住宿的大车店，备有便宜的饭食。这些都使农民感到满意。
