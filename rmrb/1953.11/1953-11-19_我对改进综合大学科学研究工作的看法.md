    My Views on Improving Scientific Research in Comprehensive Universities
    Zheng Tianting, Head of the History Department of Nankai University
    Participating in the first National Comprehensive University Conference convened by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education in September was a very important learning experience for me personally.
    Through this conference, I deeply realized that the so-called scientific research work of the bourgeoisie is entirely based on personal fame and gain. Some use bizarre arguments to confuse readers, and some use obscure questions to elevate themselves. This is absolutely wrong. Our scientific research work today should focus on solving important problems in national construction, be conducted in a planned and guided manner, and be combined with teaching, production, and politics. Moreover, we must, as Comrade Stalin said, dare to fight against outdated science and pave the way for new science. However, the research work we have conducted in the past was narrow. Most of us were not only limited to historical textual research, but also the historical materials we introduced into history teaching were inevitably stale and extremely poor. For example, when talking about water conservancy and irrigation, we often cite the Zheng Guo Canal (246 BC) in the Jing River area, but rarely mention the Liufu Canal (111 BC) and the Bai Canal (95 BC). Although there is a chronological difference, if we include the vivid folk song describing the Bai Canal at the time, "Where do we farm? At the mouth of the Chiyang Valley. Zheng Guo Canal was before, Bai Canal was after. Raising shovels as clouds, opening canals as rain. One *dan* of Jing River water, its mud is several *dou*, irrigating and fertilizing, growing our millet. Clothing and feeding the capital, hundreds of millions of mouths" (see *History of the Former Han Dynasty*, Volume 29, Treatise on Rivers and Canals), it would be helpful for the progress of teaching and the improvement of learning enthusiasm. Furthermore, when we talk about the water conservancy of the Zhang River, we like to cite Ximen Bao (around 403 BC), but rarely talk about Shi Qi (around 334 BC). Although Shi Qi came later, judging from the folk praise "Turning barren saline land into rice paddies for all time" (see *History of the Former Han Dynasty*, Volume 29, Treatise on Rivers and Canals), we can see that his contribution to the people in this regard exceeded that of Ximen Bao. Moreover, mentioning them together can also show that China's work on diverting water for irrigation has been developing continuously. In addition, when we talk about conquering nature and inventions and discoveries, we often neglect to make connections. The *Geography of the History of the Han Dynasty* (mid-1st century) states that Gaonu County "has the Wei River, which is flammable" (see *History of the Former Han Dynasty*, Volume 28, Part 2. The original character for flammable is ?, which is an ancient writing), according to the explanation of the *Commentary on the Water Classic* (late 5th century), it means "there is grease on the water, which can be taken and used." The *Commentary on the Water Classic* also quotes the *Record of Diverse Matters* (late 3rd century) saying, "South of Yanshou County in Jiuquan, there is a spring of water, as large as a bamboo basket, flowing into the ground to form a ditch. The water has grease, like meat juice. When taken into a container, it is first yellow and then black, like solidified ointment, burning extremely brightly, no different from oil (candle). It is very good for greasing (painting) carriages and water mill vats. The locals call it stone lacquer" (see *Commentary on the Water Classic*, Volume 3). The *Yuanhe Prefectural and County Gazetteer* (early 9th century) says it even more clearly, stating, "There is moss in the spring, like fatty meat, which burns extremely brightly." The *Later Han Dynasty Prefectures and Kingdoms Gazetteer* (early 6th century) quoting *Record of Diverse Matters* already mentioned that this spring water "cannot be eaten" (see *History of the Later Han Dynasty*, Volume 33, *Gazetteer of Prefectures and Kingdoms* 5). The *Comprehensive Gazetteer of the Great Qing Reign of Jiaqing* quoting the *Gansu Provincial Gazetteer* (18th century) says, "Locals take it to light lamps" (Volume 279). The *Yuanhe Prefectural and County Gazetteer* even cites a story of the people using this spring water to resist foreign invasions, stating, "During the Xuanzheng reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou (578 AD), the Turks besieged Jiuquan. (The residents) took this grease to light fires and burn their siege equipment. The fire became brighter with water, and Jiuquan was saved thanks to it" (see this *Gazetteer*, Volume 40). This all refers to the Yumen oil mine, all of which are the fruits of the Chinese people's labor. Things like this are extremely meaningful in patriotic education, but we rarely connect them when teaching. Originally, Chinese history is exceptionally rich and should be explored more, so that students in elementary school, middle school, and university do not encounter only the same, isolated examples, and doubt the poverty of the motherland's history. However, due to the limitations of old historical viewpoints and research methods, we rarely pay attention to these things. This situation must be changed. That is to say, we must first correct our attitude toward research work and change the past research methods that only focused on historical textual research without paying attention to correctly applying historical materials to teaching. We must avoid listing phenomena without analysis, avoid focusing only on analysis while neglecting examples, avoid dogmatism, and avoid citing doubtful, inappropriate, and incorrect materials. We must ensure that the materials are clear, systematic, specific, and easy to understand, and extract the truly typical phenomena that reflect the objective laws of development from complex historical phenomena, fully indicate the role of the Chinese people in the development of world history, and fully combine the spirit of patriotism and internationalism in teaching.
    Through this conference, I also deeply realized that for us teachers to carry out creative scientific research work, the most important thing is to study Marxist-Leninist theory, and it must be a long-term, planned, and systematic study. Because for intellectuals like us, although there are things of the present and things of the future in our thoughts, there are more things of the past, especially when encountering specific problems, contradictions will appear. For example, in this conference, when discussing the "additional courses" of the history major, we unconsciously confused it with the "elective courses" of the past; when discussing the content of world history and Asian history, we unconsciously fell into the old framework of the British and American bourgeois Western history system. This shows that if we want to break through the old shackles and move forward on the new road without obstacles, we must intensify our studies and further transform our thinking. In addition to general political theory study, teachers of the history major at Nankai University also have professional theory study. Recently, a three-year plan has been preliminarily formulated, requiring systematic study of fifteen classic works of Marxism-Leninism within three years, studying two or three volumes each semester, focusing on self-study, and holding discussions when necessary. In addition, in coordination with professional learning, small seminars are held if there are different opinions in teaching. The purpose of the seminars is to embody the combination of theory and practice, specifically apply the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to academic research, and explore ways to solve problems in teaching content through discussion. We only require that through the seminars, we strengthen our theoretical study, enrich our historical science foundation knowledge, and fully use new viewpoints and methods to criticize some of the historical materials we know, inspire each other, help each other, so that we can further meticulously research and collect historical materials, cultivate a new academic atmosphere, thereby improving our thinking, improving our professional level, and improving our teaching work. In the past, we held a seminar on the evolution from ape to man, which was fruitful. We feel that only by combining teaching, through the common study and common improvement of theory, can we truly promote democracy in academia, do a good job in uniting new and old teachers, and strive for a common goal.
    The gains from this conference are many. Through this conference, I am full of confidence in improving the history teaching work of comprehensive universities because many ambiguous thoughts have been resolved and many problems have been clarified.

    我对改进综合大学科学研究工作的看法
    南开大学历史系主任　郑天挺
    参加中央人民政府高等教育部在九月间召开的第一次全国综合大学会议，对我个人来说，是一次很重要的学习。
    经过这次会议，我深刻地认识了资产阶级的所谓科学研究工作，是全从个人名利出发的，他们有的用诡诞言论炫惑读者，有的用冷僻问题抬高自己，这都是绝对错误的。我们今天的科学研究工作应该以解决国家建设上的重要问题为主，要有领导地、有计划地进行，要结合教学，结合生产，结合政治；而且必须如斯大林同志所说的，要敢于对陈腐的科学进行斗争，且能为新的科学铺平道路。但我们过去所进行的研究工作是狭隘的，我们大部分人不仅只局限在史料考证工作方面，就是我们介绍到历史教学上面来的史料，也不免陈陈相因，极端贫乏。如讲到水利灌溉，在泾水方面我们常举郑国渠
  （公元前二四六年），而很少提到六辅渠（公元前一一一年）和白渠（公元前九五年）；这虽然有前后之别，但是我们如把当时生动地描写白渠的民歌，“田于何所？池阳谷口。郑国在前，白渠起后。举锸为云，决渠为雨。泾水一石，其泥数斗，且溉且粪，长我禾黍。衣食京师，亿万之口”（见前汉书卷二十九沟洫志），一同讲述，对于教学的进行和学习情绪的提高是有帮助的。又如我们讲漳水的水利，喜欢举西门豹（公元前四○三年顷），而很少谈史起
  （公元前三三四年顷）；史起虽然在后，但看“终古舄卤兮生稻粱”（见前汉书卷二十九沟洫志）的民间歌颂，可知他在这方面对人民的功绩是超过西门豹的；而且同时并举，也可以看出中国的引水溉田工作一直在发展着。此外，我们讲征服自然和发明、发现，也往往忽略联系。汉书地理志（一世纪中）说，高奴县“有洧水，可燃”（见前汉书卷二十八下。原文燃作?，系古写），据水经注（五世纪末）的解说，是“水上有肥，可接取用之”。水经注又引博物志（三世纪末）说，“酒泉延寿县南山出泉水，大如筥，注地为沟，水有肥，如肉汁，取著器中，始黄后黑，如凝膏，然（燃）极明，与膏（油烛）无异，膏（涂）车及水碓缸甚佳，彼方人谓之石漆”（见水经注卷三）；到了元和郡县图志（九世纪初）说的更清楚，它说，“泉有苔，如肥肉，燃之极明”；在后汉郡国志（六世纪初）引博物记已经说到这种泉水“不可食”（见后汉书卷三十三郡国志五），清嘉庆一统志引甘肃省通志（十八世纪）说，“土人取以燃灯”（卷二七九）；在元和郡县图志中更举了一个人民利用这种泉水抗拒外族侵略的故事，它说，“周武帝宣政中（五七八年），突厥围酒泉，（居民）取此脂燃火，焚其攻具，得水愈明，酒泉赖以获济”（见该志卷四十）；这全说的是玉门油矿，全是中国人民的劳动成果，诸如此类，在爱国主义教育上都是极有意义的，可是我们很少联系起来讲述。本来，中国的历史是异常丰富的，应当多多发掘，不要使学生在小学、在中学、在大学，所遇到的全是些相同的、孤单的举例，而怀疑祖国历史的贫乏。但由于旧的历史观点和研究方法的限制，我们很少注意到这些。这种状况是必须改变的。那也就是说，我们首先要端正研究工作的态度，改变过去那种只注意史料考证工作而不注意正确地运用史料于教学的研究方法。我们须要避免罗列现象不加分析，避免只重分析忽略例证，避免教条主义，避免引用可疑的、不适当的、不正确的资料；要保证材料的明确、系统、具体和易于理解，并要从复杂的历史现象中抽出反映客观发展规律的真正典型的现象，完整地指出中国人民在世界历史中发展的作用，充分结合爱国主义和国际主义精神，进行教学。
    经过这次会议，我也深刻地认识了，对于我们这些教师们，要进行创造性的科学研究工作，最重要的是学习马克思列宁主义理论，而且必须长期地、有计划地、有系统地学习。因为如我们这些知识分子，在思想上虽然存在有现在的东西和将来的东西，但更多地存在有过去的东西，特别一遇到具体问题，就要现出矛盾。如在这次会议中，讨论到历史专业的“加修课程”时，我们曾不自觉地把它和过去的“选修课程”混淆起来；讨论到世界史和亚洲史的内容，我们又不自觉地陷入过去英美资产阶级西洋史体系的窠臼；这就说明，我们如想突破旧樊笼，没有障碍地在新道路上前进，必须加紧学习、进一步地改造思想。南开大学历史专业教师们在一般的政治理论学习以外还有业务理论学习，最近并初步拟定了一个三年计划，要求在三年内系统地学习马克思列宁主义的十五册经典著作，每学期学习两册或三册，以自学为主，必要时举行讨论。此外，配合业务学习，如在教学上发生不同意见，就举行小型座谈会。座谈会的目的在体现理论和业务相结合，把辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点、方法具体地应用到学术研究上，用讨论方式试探解决教学内容问题的途径；我们只要求通过座谈会加强我们的理论学习，丰富我们的历史科学基础知识，充分地运用新的观点、方法来批判我们所知道的一些史料，相互启发，相互帮助，使我们能够更进一步地去精密研究和搜集史料，培养新的学术空气，从而提高我们的思想，提高我们的业务水平，提高我们的教学工作。过去我们曾举行过一次从猿到人座谈会，是有收获的。我们觉得，只有结合教学，通过理论的共同学习，共同提高，才能真正发扬学术上的民主，并做好新老教师的团结工作，为一个共同的目标而奋斗。
    这次会议的收获是很多的。经过这次会议，由于解决了许多模糊思想，明确了许多问题，我对于改进综合大学历史教学工作是充满信心的。
