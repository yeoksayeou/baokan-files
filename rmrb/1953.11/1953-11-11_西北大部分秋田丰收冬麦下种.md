The more than 72 million mu of autumn crops in the Northwest Plateau have generally yielded better harvests this year than last, with the exception of some areas in Gansu and Qinghai that suffered from disasters. In Shaanxi, the average yield of autumn grain per mu reached 136 jin, an increase of 10% compared to last year, while the average yield of cotton per mu reached 40 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 25% compared to last year. The old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi witnessed a bumper harvest unseen in over a decade, with yields generally increasing by 30% to 50% compared to last year. In Xinjiang, rice, cotton, and early corn experienced a rare bumper harvest since liberation four years ago. The average yield of corn per mu reached over 450 jin, an increase of over 20% compared to last year. It is estimated that the region's autumn crop output will exceed the planned target.

This year, farmers in most parts of the Northwest region have changed their old mindset of "A good summer harvest ensures a worry-free year, while the quality of the autumn harvest is insignificant." They have responded to the call for increased production and conservation, paying attention to protecting autumn fields and improving harvesting methods. Many mountainous areas in Shaanxi and Gansu have launched organized wild boar hunting campaigns to protect autumn crops. In Lueyang County, Shaanxi alone, seven districts established eight command headquarters, mobilizing over 3,000 people and 1,500 locally-made guns. In eight days from August 1st, they killed over 600 wild boars, porcupines, and other harmful animals. The hog-hunting team in Wudu Prefecture, Gansu, had eliminated nearly 20,000 wild animals and harmful birds by mid-September. Eleven agricultural counties (cities) in Qinghai universally carried out campaigns to eliminate blind rats, greatly reducing losses to autumn fields. After the autumn harvest began, various localities also put forward the slogan "Every grain returns home" and improved harvesting methods. In order to achieve "high yield and bumper harvest," many farmers in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi changed the past practice of "autumn harvest, winter threshing" and implemented "harvest as it ripens, thresh as it is harvested," to minimize wind, frost, and freezing damage. Farmers in the Han River basin in southern Shaanxi used cross-binding methods for rice stalks to prevent lodging, and adopted methods of harvesting as it yellows and quick, careful threshing, which resulted in an additional 8.5 jin of grain per mu of rice paddy. In Dazhao, Yinzhen, and other districts of Chang'an County, about 100,000 mu of millet were harvested by farmers who first cut the millet ears and then the stalks, resulting in an additional yield of around 150,000 jin.

The winter wheat sowing in the Northwest region has been mostly completed. In areas where seedlings have emerged, robust, tender green wheat fields indicate that the area sown with improved varieties, row planting with dense spacing, and irrigation has expanded this year. According to preliminary statistics, in the fertile Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, the area sown with the cold-resistant and drought-resistant "Bima No. 1" improved variety has increased from 3 million mu last year to 5 million mu this year. In the low-lying areas along the Wei River, the area sown with the wheat blossom midge-resistant "6028" improved variety has also increased from around 80,000 mu last year to over 300,000 mu. In the past, most farmers used broadcasting methods for sowing winter wheat. This year, most areas in Shaanxi have switched to row sowing with drills. In Lingtai County, Gansu, 60% of the wheat fields have been converted to row sowing. Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu also held winter wheat sowing training classes attended by over 800 people before the autumn harvest, teaching drill sowing techniques. The autumn irrigation area of large canals in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, reached over 370,000 mu. (Northwest Reporter Station)

### 西北大部分秋田丰收冬麦下种

    西北大部分秋田丰收冬麦下种
    西北高原上的七千二百多万亩秋庄稼，今年的收成，除甘肃、青海有些地方受灾外，一般都比去年好，陕西秋粮每亩平均可收一百三十六斤，比去年增产一成，棉花每亩平均可收四十斤皮棉，比去年增产百分之二十五。陕北老根据地出现了十多年来没见过的大丰收，一般比去年增产三成到五成。新疆的水稻、棉花和早玉米，是解放四年来少见的丰收，玉米每亩平均可收四百五十多斤，比去年增产百分之二十强。估计全区秋田产量还能超过计划。
    今年西北大部地区的农民，改变了过去“夏田丰收，一年不愁。秋田好坏，无关紧要”的老观念，响应了增产节约的号召，注意了保护秋田、改进收割方法。陕西、甘肃许多山区，开展了有组织的打野猪护秋运动。单是陕西的略阳县七个区，就成立了八个指挥部，动员了三千多人和一千五百枝土枪，从八月一日起的八天当中，打死了六百多只野猪、刺猪等害兽。甘肃武都专区的打猪小组，到九月中旬为止，消灭了近两万只野兽害鸟。青海十一个农业县（市）普遍开展了消灭瞎老鼠运动，大大减少了秋田的损失。秋收开始后，各地又提出了“颗粒还家”的口号，改进收割方法。陕北老根据地不少农民为了做到“丰产丰收”，改变了往年“秋收冬打”的习惯，做到“熟一块收一块，随收随打”，尽量减少风、霜、冻等灾害。陕西南部汉江流域的农民，用交叉捆扎稻丛的办法，防止倒伏，又用随黄随割、快割细打的办法，使得每亩稻田多收了八斤半谷子。长安县大兆、引镇等区约有十万亩谷子，农民用先割谷穗、后割谷秆的办法，就多收了十五万斤左右。
    西北地区的冬麦已大部下种，在早苗出土的地方，呈现着茁壮的嫩绿的麦陇，显示今年已扩大了优良品种、条播密植和灌溉的面积。据初步统计，在土地肥沃的陕西关中地区，播种耐寒抗旱的“碧蚂一号”良种的面积，已由去年的三百万亩增加到今年的五百万亩；在渭河沿岸低洼地带，播种抗吸浆虫的“六○二八”良种的面积，也由去年的八万亩左右增加到三十多万亩。往年农民播种冬麦多数采用撒播方法，今年陕西大部地区已改用耧种条播，甘肃灵台一县就有百分之六十的麦地改为条播。甘肃天水专区并在秋收前举办了八百多人参加的冬麦播种训练班，传授了耧种技术。陕西关中各大型渠道秋灌面积达三十七万多亩。（西北记者站）
