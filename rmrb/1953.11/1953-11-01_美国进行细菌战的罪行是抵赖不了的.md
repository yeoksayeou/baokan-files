The crime of the United States in conducting germ warfare against Korea and China during the Korean War is irrefutable and absolutely undeniable. However, the U.S. government, which has been unanimously condemned by fair-minded people around the world, is now attempting to use the recantations of repatriated American prisoners of war to shirk its responsibility at the Eighth UN General Assembly through its usual means of slander and defamation. This despicable practice is completely futile. Because, the fact that the United States engaged in germ warfare has not only been confirmed by irrefutable testimonial and material evidence obtained by Korea and China, but has also been made clear to the world through repeated investigations by authoritative scientists, jurists, and public leaders. These ironclad facts cannot be overturned by any lies or despicable means such as attempted recantations.

	I. The U.S.'s Long-Term Preparations for Germ Warfare

The U.S.'s use of bacteriological weapons in the Korean War was not an accidental event, but a premeditated crime in the U.S. war plan.

According to a report by Merck, Chairman of the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Committee, to the then U.S. Secretary of War in January 1946, the United States began large-scale research and manufacture of bacteriological weapons during World War II. They established a working center at Camp Detrick in Maryland, where about 4,000 people worked at that time. In addition, large-scale bacteriological weapons factories and field test sites were established in Vigo, Indiana; Pascagoula, Mississippi; and Dugway, Utah. The huge expenses the U.S. government spent on bacteriological weapons also increased year by year. According to Brennan, commander of the U.S. Chemical Corps, in March 1952, the corps' funding for "research and development" of biological and chemical warfare was $12.2 million more than in 1951. The Associated Press revealed in August this year that, according to the U.S. plan to develop bacteriological weapons, the U.S. Army entered the stage of large-scale manufacturing and storage of bacteriological weapons more than a year ago. This coincides with the time when the United States launched germ warfare in Korea and China.

In the process of researching and manufacturing bacteriological weapons, the U.S. government made extensive use of equipment and manpower received from Japanese fascists and Nazi German war criminals. Notorious Japanese germ warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano were all used by the United States as accomplices in conducting germ warfare against Korea and China. The Japanese delegation attending the Vienna World People's Peace Congress revealed that the United States had established a large-scale bacteriological weapons supply center in Tokyo—called the 406th unit of the U.S. Eighth Army. The original members of the former Japanese militarist bacteriological warfare organization "Unit 731" helped the United States manufacture bacteriological weapons for use by the invading U.S. forces. This confirms the judgment in the report published last year by the International Scientific Commission: The germ warfare conducted by the U.S. military in Korea and China "seems to have developed some of the methods used by the Japanese army in germ warfare during World War II."

	II. The U.S.'s Use of Bacteriological Weapons in Korea and China

After the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. news media repeatedly revealed that the U.S. military believed that this war was an ideal place for the United States to test various weapons. Therefore, bacteriological weapons were also used on a large scale.

As early as December 1950 and January 1951, when the invading U.S. troops retreated from northern Korea, they used bacteriological weapons for the first time, spreading smallpox germs in the area south of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line. Following this, the United States used captured personnel from China and Korea for inhumane bacteriological weapons experiments. According to "Newsweek" on April 9, 1951, the U.S. bacteriological landing craft No. 1091 arrived outside Wonsan Port in March to conduct bacteriological weapons experiments on Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners. Soon, this bacteriological landing craft sailed to Geoje Island. The Associated Press reported on May 18 of the same year that the laboratory on the ship obtained oral and intestinal cultures from the prisoners on the island and conducted 3,000 tests every day, resulting in "1,400 of the more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners locked up on the island" becoming "severely ill," and "about 80 percent of the rest contracting some kind of disease."

After the above-mentioned inhumane "experiments," according to a confession by captured U.S. Air Force senior official Hebblewaite, the U.S. highest military authority—the Joint Chiefs of Staff—issued instructions to the invading U.S. forces in October 1951 to begin germ warfare. This instruction stipulated that germ warfare should be carried out in stages: first a small experimental stage, then gradually expanded into formal bacteriological warfare.

The experimental phase began in November 1951. During this phase, the "basic objectives" stipulated by the U.S. military were: "to test various factors of germ warfare in real situations"—including testing the effects of various available diseases, testing methods of throwing bacteria using different types of aircraft, different types of bacterial containers in various different ways, and testing the results of conducting germ warfare in various different terrains, different types of areas, and in different seasons—including the coldest and hottest temperatures in Korea, etc.

From the end of January 1952, the scope and quantity of U.S. military use of bacteriological weapons in Korea expanded. According to incomplete statistics that have been discovered, in the forty-odd days from January 28 to March 15, U.S. aircraft scattered insects and other bacteria-carrying bodies 226 times in various parts of Korea. From the end of February, many areas in Northeast China also successively discovered large numbers of bacteria-carrying objects dropped by U.S. aircraft.

After Korea and China exposed the U.S. military's crimes of conducting germ warfare in February 1952, the United States, while denying it, did not relax its germ warfare plan. From May 1952, they expanded the scale of germ warfare again and formally entered the stage of using bacteriological weapons in combat. They planned to establish a "contaminated zone" running across the Korean Peninsula along the line from Sinanju and Kunu-ri eastward. Key targets in this zone were to be re-infected every ten days in an attempt to coordinate with the invading U.S. forces' so-called "air strangulation war" at the time to cut off our transportation lines. Due to the effective anti-bacteriological warfare measures taken by the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the U.S. military's criminal plan failed shamefully. However, they did not give up, and continued to spread bacteria in Korea and China, especially after the weather warmed up this year, when the U.S. military's germ warfare was once again carried out on a large scale.

The U.S. military used many methods and types of bacteria to spread bacteria in Korea and China. These included launching various types of bacterial bombs and directly dropping bacteria-carrying objects or spraying bacteria-carrying dust from aircraft. The bacteria-carrying objects dropped by U.S. aircraft, identified by the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts on Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" and experts from Korea and China, included 18 kinds of insects, as well as bacteria-carrying small field mice, small fish, clams, and other animals, as well as bacteria-carrying leaves, feathers, cotton balls, corn kernels, etc. These either directly spread germs to humans, livestock, and crops, or indirectly spread diseases. According to identifications, the germs used by the U.S. military included plague bacillus, cholera vibrio, typhoid and paratyphoid bacillus, anthrax bacillus, encephalitis virus, and many kinds of germs that harm livestock, poultry, and crops.

The U.S. military adopted extremely cunning methods when spreading bacteria. U.S. aircraft generally dropped bacterial bombs at night or on cloudy days, and sometimes dropped bacterial bombs along with ordinary bombs in an attempt to make it difficult for the Korean and Chinese people to detect them. They implemented an extremely strict confidentiality system among the U.S. troops carrying out germ warfare missions, using code names such as "super propaganda" and "non-explosive bombs" to refer to bacteriological weapons, and prohibited U.S. personnel from mentioning germ warfare in writing or in conversation in order to cover up their crimes.

	III. The Irrefutable Evidence of U.S. Germ Warfare

Despite the U.S. germ warfare criminals' attempts to conceal and deny their crimes, their crimes were quickly and thoroughly exposed to the people of the world.

After the Korean and Chinese people discovered the fact that the United States was conducting germ warfare in January and February 1952, they immediately accused the world. The two countries' powerful health organizations and experts collected a large amount of evidence on the spot and made scientific inspections and identifications. The Chinese people organized an "Investigation Group on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism," which went to Korea and Northeast China to conduct on-the-spot investigations and published investigation reports. The Chinese people also organized an "Exhibition on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by the U.S. Government" with part of the evidence collected, which was exhibited in Berlin, Vienna, and other places.

In March 1952, when the U.S. germ warfare crimes were first exposed, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team sent to Korea to investigate war crimes was working in Korea. Therefore, they were the first international notaries of the U.S. germ warfare crimes. This investigation team was composed of authoritative jurists with different political views from eight countries including Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, China, Belgium, Brazil, and Poland. After witnessing the serious crime of the U.S. government undermining international law, they devoted a chapter to listing evidence of U.S. germ warfare in Korea in their "Report on U.S. War Crimes in Korea"; in addition, the investigation team also published a "Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by U.S. Troops on Chinese Territory," using irrefutable facts to issue a righteous accusation to the world.

From June to August 1952, the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts on Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," organized by the World Peace Council, went to China and Korea and thoroughly investigated the facts of U.S. germ warfare. This commission was composed of fair-minded scientists from Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, and the Soviet Union who were known throughout the world. The commission conducted more than two months of on-the-spot investigations in Korea and China. With a fair attitude, based on the most rigorous scientific methods, they repeatedly verified a large number of facts and came to the conclusion based on meticulous logic that: "The people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become the target of attacks with bacteriological weapons; the U.S. military has used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways..." The commission said in the report it published: "This inhumane means, which is unanimously condemned by people of all countries, has actually been used, which was not easy for the members of this committee to believe in the past; now this committee is forced by the facts to draw these conclusions." This report has become a historical document in the struggle against bacteriological warfare.

International well-known figures who have conducted investigations in Korea and China also include John, Dean of Canterbury in the United Kingdom, Jacques, Chairman of the National Peace Council of France, and James Endicott, Chairman of the National Council of the Canadian Peace Congress. They also proved the fact of U.S. germ warfare with irrefutable evidence.

When the Korean and Chinese people and international figures successively exposed the crimes of the United States in conducting germ warfare, some captured U.S. Air Force personnel who had personally carried out germ warfare missions confessed, under the influence of the policy of lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, the process of their participation in germ warfare. These people were captured at different times and in different places. After being captured, they were also located in different places. However, the main contents of their confessions coincided with each other in a consistent manner. U.S. pilots Enoch, Quinn, O'Neill, and Kness each described in detail when, where, and with whom they received secret training in germ warfare, and what the content of this secret course was. Then, they each admitted the number of times they carried out germ warfare missions, and the details of each time they dropped bacterial bombs were very detailed and accurate. After the International Scientific Commission met these prisoners of war, they wrote in their report: "The members of the commission unanimously believed that no physical or mental pressure was applied to these prisoners of war to force them to make statements. They made the statements voluntarily." The confession of Hebblewaite, Chief of Staff of the 1st Air Wing of the U.S. Marine Corps, provided even more detailed and accurate information about the entire plan of the invading U.S. forces to conduct germ warfare that he knew, and described all the details of the arrangement and execution of this plan. The detailed facts provided by these prisoners of war in their confessions have never been denied by the U.S. government and the generals who implemented this criminal plan, and the U.S. representatives attending the UN General Assembly. Now, just when the United States is using the recantations of these repatriated prisoners of war to whitewash its crimes, it cannot point out any falsehoods in the circumstances of the confessions that it is trying to overturn. This fully proves that the recantations of the repatriated U.S. prisoners of war were completely coerced. Therefore, the U.S. government's attempt to use this to deny its crimes is fundamentally impossible.

	IV. The U.S. Cannot Escape Responsibility for Germ Warfare

The U.S. aggressive bloc has always attempted to use bacteriological weapons of mass destruction as a tool to dominate the world. Therefore, the U.S. government has so far refused to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons; former U.S. President Truman even openly slandered this solemn international convention as "outdated." U.S. military and politicians, such as Clisbee, Director of Research and Development of the U.S. Chemical Corps, have even inhumanely declared that bacteriological weapons "can enable us to weaken the enemy's resistance at the least cost and achieve victory." However, the U.S. germ warfare against Korea and China was defeated shamefully under the resolute counterattack of the Korean and Chinese people, and aroused unanimous opposition from the world.

International organizations representing the will of the vast majority of people in the world, such as the World Peace Council, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students, have issued statements one after another, resolutely protesting the U.S. crimes of conducting germ warfare. The World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna last year, the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference held in Beijing, and the American Peace Congress held in Montevideo all unanimously passed resolutions against germ warfare.

People in the Soviet Union, Vietnam, the Mongolian People's Republic, and various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe have held countless mass rallies against germ warfare; in Asia, Western European countries, and all the way to South America and the United States, countless peace-loving people have participated in the movement against germ warfare, including strikes, class boycotts, marches, demonstrations, protests, appeals, and other activities.

In the face of ironclad facts and the severe condemnation of the people of the world, the United States cannot escape responsibility for conducting germ warfare. The U.S.'s shameless sophistry at the Eighth UN General Assembly can only further expose its ugly face more thoroughly.

In order to thoroughly implement the international convention prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and in order to protect the safety of mankind, the Soviet representative has once again proposed in the Political Committee of the Eighth UN General Assembly that the UN General Assembly should call on all countries that have not joined or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol to join or ratify this protocol. If the United Nations respects its own responsibilities, it should adopt this fair proposal of the Soviet Union and condemn the United States for refusing to ratify this protocol and for its planned crimes of conducting germ warfare. Otherwise, the United Nations can only prove once again that it is a tool to cover up U.S. crimes of aggression.

    美国进行细菌战的罪行是抵赖不了的
    李高
    美国在侵朝战争中对朝中两国进行细菌战的罪行铁证如山，绝对无法抵赖。但是，遭到全世界公正人士一致谴责的美国政府，现在却企图利用被遣返的美国战俘的翻供，在第八届联合国大会上以他们惯用的诬蔑和诽谤手段，来推脱他们的罪责。这种卑劣的做法完全是徒劳的。因为，美国进行细菌战的事实，不但为朝中两国所获得的无可辩驳的人证和物证所证实，并早经世界权威的科学家、法学家及社会公众领袖多次调查而大白于世界。这种铁的事实，是任何谎言和企图翻供之类的卑劣手段所不能推翻的。
      一、美国长期准备进行细菌战的情况
    美国在侵朝战争中使用细菌武器并不是偶然的事件，而是美国战争计划中一种蓄谋已久的罪行。
    据美国陆军生物战争委员会主席墨尔克一九四六年一月给当时美国陆军部长的报告中透露：美国在第二次世界大战期间就开始大规模研究和制造细菌武器。他们在马里兰州的狄特里克营建立了工作中心，那时就约有四千人在那儿工作。另外，还在印第安那州的维哥、密士失必州的巴斯卡高拉、犹太州的得格威等地分别建立了大规模的细菌武器工厂和野外试验场所。美国政府用于细菌武器的庞大费用也逐年增加。据美国化学兵团司令布伦在一九五二年三月透露，这个兵团当时用来“研究与发展”生物战、化学战的经费，就比一九五一年多了一千二百万美元。合众社在今年八月透露：按照美国发展细菌武器的计划，美国陆军在一年多之前就进入了大批制造和储存细菌武器的阶段。这正与美国在朝鲜和我国发动细菌战的时间相合。
    在研究和制造细菌武器过程中，美国政府大批地利用了从日本法西斯和纳粹德国战犯手中接收过来的设备和人力。恶名昭著的日本细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等人，都曾被美国利用为对朝中两国进行细菌战的帮凶。出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的日本代表团揭露：美国在东京建立了大规模的细菌武器供应中心——名称是美军第八军的四○六处。前日本军国主义者的细菌战机构“七三一部队”的原班人马，就曾帮助美国制造细菌武器，以供给侵朝美军使用。这就证实了国际科学委员会去年发表的报告书中的判断：美国军队在朝鲜、中国所进行的细菌战，“其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。”
      二、美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的经过
    朝鲜战争发生以后，美国新闻机关无数次地透露：美国军方认为这个战争是美国试用各种武器的理想场合。因此，细菌武器也被大规模地使用了。
    早在一九五○年十二月和一九五一年一月，侵朝美军从朝鲜北部败退时，就第一次使用了细菌武器，在平壤、元山一线以南地带撒布天花病菌。继此以后，美国又拿中朝被俘人员进行了惨无人道的细菌武器试验。据美国“新闻周刊”在一九五一年四月九日透露，美国第一○九一号细菌登陆艇在三月间到了元山港外，以中国人民志愿军被俘人员从事细菌武器试验。不久，这艘细菌登陆艇又开到了巨济岛。美联社在同年五月十八日报道说：船上的实验室从岛上的战俘中取得口与肠的培养物，每天进行三千次试验，结果使岛上“关着的十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏”中，“有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病”。
    经过上述的灭绝人性的“试验”之后，据被俘的美国空军高级官员许威布尔供称，美国最高军事当局——参谋长联席会议，在一九五一年十月向侵朝美军下达了开始进行细菌战的指示。这个指示规定细菌战分阶段进行：最初是小的试验阶段，然后逐渐扩大成为正式以细菌武器作战。
    试验阶段开始于一九五一年十一月。在这一阶段中，美军规定的“基本目标”是：“在实地的情况下试验细菌战的各种不同的因素”——包括试验各种可用的疾病的效果，试验使用不同类型的飞机、不同种类的细菌容器以各种不同方式投掷细菌的方法，试验向各种不同的地形、不同性质的地区以及在不同的季节——包括朝鲜最冷最热的气温下进行细菌战的结果等等。
    一九五二年一月末起，美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器的范围和数量都扩大了。据已发觉的不完全统计，从一月二十八日到三月十五日这四十多天中，美国飞机在朝鲜各地撒布了昆虫和其他带菌体达二百二十六次之多。二月末起，我国东北等地许多地区，也连着发现了美国飞机大批地投下的带菌物。
    朝、中两国在一九五二年二月揭露了美军进行细菌战的罪行以后，美国一面进行抵赖，一面仍毫不放松他们的细菌战计划。一九五二年五月起，他们再度扩大了进行细菌战的规模，正式进入以细菌武器作战的阶段。他们计划沿新安州、军隅里向东的一线，建立一条横贯朝鲜半岛的“沾染地带”。在这个地带的重要目标上，每隔十天就去重新撒布细菌一次，企图以此配合侵朝美军当时叫嚣着的所谓“空中绞杀战”，以截断我方的交通线。由于朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军采取了有效的反细菌战措施，美军的罪恶计划可耻地失败了。可是他们仍不死心，以后一直继续不停地在朝鲜和我国境内撒布细菌，特别是今年春暖以后，美军的细菌战又曾一度大规模进行。
    美军在朝鲜和中国撒播细菌的方法和种类很多。包括投射各种类型的细菌弹和用飞机直接投下带菌物体或喷洒带菌尘埃等。美国飞机所投下的带菌物体，经“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”和朝中两国专家鉴定的，就有十八种昆虫以及带菌的小田鼠、小鱼、文蛤等动物，还有带菌的树叶、羽毛、棉花球、玉米粒等等。其中或是直接向人类及牲畜、农作物等传播病菌，或是间接传播疾病。美军所使用的病菌，据已鉴定的，包括有鼠疫杆菌、霍乱弧菌、伤寒及副伤寒杆菌、炭疽杆菌、脑炎病毒和许多种危害家畜、家禽、危害农作物的病菌。
    美军撒布细菌时采取了极端狡猾的手段。美国飞机一般是乘黑夜或阴天投掷细菌弹，有时将细菌弹和普通炸弹一道投掷，企图使中朝人民不易发觉。他们在执行细菌战任务的美国部队中施行了极严格的保密制度，以“超级宣传”、“不爆炸的炸弹”等暗号来称呼细菌武器，并且禁止美国人员在书面上和言谈中提到细菌战，以掩盖其罪行。
    三、美国进行细菌战的无可置辩的证据
    尽管美国细菌战犯们百端掩饰和狡赖，他们的罪行仍很快就在世界人民的面前被彻底揭露了。
    朝中人民在一九五二年一、二月先后发觉了美国进行细菌战的事实以后，立刻向全世界进行了控诉。两国的强大卫生工作组织和专家们，就地收集了大量的罪证，并作了科学的检查和鉴定。中国人民曾组织“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，分赴朝鲜和我国东北作了实地调查，发表了调查报告。中国人民并将所收集的证据的一部分，举办了“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”，曾在柏林、维也纳等地展出。
    一九五二年三月，当美国细菌战罪行刚被揭发时，国际民主法律工作者协会派往朝鲜调查战争罪行的调查团正在朝鲜工作。因此，他们是美国细菌战罪行的第一批国际公证人。这个调查团是由来自奥地利、意大利、英国、法国、中国、比利时、巴西和波兰等八个国家的具有不同政治观点的权威的法学家组成的。他们目睹了美国政府这种破坏国际法的严重罪行之后，在他们的“关于美国在朝鲜的战争罪行的报告”中专列一章，列举了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的证据；另外，调查团还发表了“关于美国军队在中国领土上使用细菌武器的报告”，用无可置辩的事实向全世界发出了正义的控诉。
    一九五二年六月到八月，由世界和平理事会发起组织的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”到了中国和朝鲜，详尽地调查了美国进行细菌战的事实。这个委员会是由世界知名的瑞典、法国、英国、意大利、巴西和苏联的公正的科学家组成的。委员会在朝鲜和中国进行了两个多月的实地调查，他们以公正的态度，根据最严谨的科学方法，反复验证了大量事实，遵循缜密的逻辑得出结论说：“朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器……”委员会发表的报告书中说：“这种遭各国人民一致谴责的灭绝人性的手段，竟见诸施用，此为本委员会的委员们过去所不易置信；现在本委员会迫于事实，必须下这些结论。”这部报告书已成为人类反细菌战斗争中历史性的文件。
    在朝鲜和我国进行过调查的，还有英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊、法国全国和平理事会主席法奇、加拿大和平大会全国理事会主席文幼章等国际知名人士。他们也都以无可辩驳的证据证明了美国进行细菌战的事实。
    当中朝人民和国际人士相继揭露美国进行细菌战的罪行的时候，一部分曾经亲身执行了细菌战任务的美国空军被俘人员，在朝中人民军队宽待战俘政策的感召下，先后供认了他们参与进行细菌战的经过。这些人是在不同的时间、不同的地点被俘的。被俘以后也分处在不同的地方。但他们供词的主要内容，都是若合符契地互相印证。美国飞行员伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔、克尼斯等人，分别叙述了他们各自在什么时间、什么地点、和那些人一道接受了进行细菌战的秘密训练，并且详细地讲出了这种秘密课程的内容。然后，他们又各自承认了执行细菌战任务的次数，以及每次投掷细菌弹的前后经过，都十分详尽确凿。国际科学委员会在会到这些战俘之后，在他们的报告书中写道：“委员会的委员们不约而同地认为对这几个战俘没有施用肉体或精神上的压力，强迫他们发表声明。他们发表声明，都是出于自愿的”。美国海军陆战队第一空军联队上校参谋长许威布尔的供词，则更详明确实地提供了他所知道的侵朝美军进行细菌战的整个计划，叙述了这个计划在布置和执行过程中的各个细节。这些战俘在供词中所提供的周详的事实，是美国政府及执行这种罪恶计划的将军们和出席联合国大会的美国代表所一直不敢否认的。现在，就在美国利用这些被遣返的战俘的翻供，进行洗刷罪行的时候，也不能指出他们所企图推翻的供词中的情节有任何虚假的所在。这就充分证明，被遣返的美国战俘的翻供完全是被逼作出来的。因此，美国政府企图借此狡赖，是根本办不到的。
    四、美国逃不脱进行细菌战的罪责
    美国侵略集团一直妄图以大规模毁灭人类的细菌武器，作为他们制霸世界的工具。因此，美国政府至今不肯批准一九二五年的禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书；前美国总统杜鲁门甚至公然诋毁这个庄严的国际公约“已经过时”。美国的军人和政客，如美国化学兵团的研究与发展处处长克利西等，更曾毫无人性地宣称：细菌武器“可以使我们以最少的代价削弱敌人的抵抗力量，从而取得胜利。”但是，美国对朝中两国进行的细菌战，在朝中人民的坚决反击下，遭到了可耻的失败，并引起全世界的一致反对。
    代表世界广大人民意志的世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会等国际组织，都先后发表声明，坚决抗议美国进行细菌战罪行。去年在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会、在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、在蒙得维的亚举行的美洲和平大会等会议上，都一致通过了反对细菌战的决议。
    苏联、越南、蒙古人民共和国和东欧各人民民主国家的人民都曾举行了无数次反对细菌战的群众集会；在亚洲、西欧各国一直到南美洲和美国国内，都有无数和平人民参加了反对细菌战的运动，包括罢工、罢课、游行、示威、抗议、呼吁等各种活动。
    在铁的事实的面前，在全世界人民的严厉谴责下，美国是逃不脱进行细菌战的罪责的。美国在第八届联合国大会上所进行的无耻狡辩，只能使它的丑恶面貌更加彻底地暴露出来。
    为了使禁止使用细菌武器的国际公约得到彻底的实施，为了保障人类的安全，苏联代表在第八届联合国大会政治委员会中已再度提出建议，要求联合国大会号召一切没有参加或批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家参加或批准这个议定书。如果联合国尊重自己的职责，就应该通过苏联的这个公正的建议，并谴责美国拒不批准这个议定书、有计划地进行细菌战的罪行。否则，联合国就只能再度证明它是掩饰美国侵略罪行的工具。
