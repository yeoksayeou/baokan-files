    The campaign to increase production and practice economy in the national forestry industry system, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, has been comprehensively and rapidly launched. Since the Ministry of Forestry issued instructions in mid-September to strive to overfulfill the timber production tasks, forestry industry departments in various regions have successively held general meetings of all employees to conduct research and discussions, and formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. According to preliminary statistics, the total value of increased production is approximately 480 billion yuan.
    In order to implement the plans to increase production and practice economy, forestry industry departments in various regions have adopted various specific and effective measures: Firstly, striving to increase production, accelerate allocation, and strive to overfulfill tasks. Forestry industry bureaus that have the conditions to overfulfill their plans are doing their best to utilize favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, and increase production. Inner Mongolia plans to increase the production of logs by more than 96,000 cubic meters, increasing the output value by nearly 60 billion yuan. Guizhou Province plans to increase the production of logs by 34,000 cubic meters, increasing the output value by approximately 19 billion yuan. The Northeast generally implements simplified processing of substandard logs (fourth-grade timber, firewood), removing decayed parts and utilizing their usable parts. In this way, 200,000 cubic meters of standard timber (sleepers and lumber) can be processed from the existing 400,000 cubic meters of substandard logs, increasing the output value by 88 billion yuan and increasing profits by 40 billion yuan. It is also planned to convert a portion of the stockpiled birch wood (20,000 cubic meters) into sleepers to accelerate capital turnover. The Southwest will also process the existing 13,000 cubic meters of substandard timber, worth approximately 2 billion yuan. The Central South region is striving to allocate 240,000 cubic meters beyond the planned amount, which can increase revenue by more than 36 billion yuan, and has decided to fully utilize the Qiushui Creek transport to transport all of this year's products to the final log yards, completing the winter creek transport work. Secondly, reducing costs, increasing profits, clearing assets, and expanding income: In the Central South region, revenue can be increased by more than 150 billion yuan by reducing costs (including a portion of the 1952 stockpiled timber, which had lower original prices) and processing substandard timber into standard timber, and handling stagnant materials. The East China region can reduce costs by more than 34 billion yuan in total. Guizhou Province will also reduce costs by 10 percent, totaling approximately 10 billion yuan. Most of the national forestry industry administrations have not yet cleared assets and verified capital, and various regions are now making arrangements to carry this out. Preliminary calculations in the Southwest region show that assets and income can be increased by more than 23 billion yuan. By clearing assets and verifying capital to handle stockpiled timber and stagnant funds, the East China and Northwest regions can save more than 30 billion yuan in working capital.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy, the Northeast convened a production operation plan working conference in late September to study the production situation and the problems in increasing production and practicing economy, as well as the measures to be taken. It also established a scheduling system and a production meeting system to master plan management. After arranging tasks, responsible cadres of the Northeast Forestry Industry Administration led working groups to go to Jilin, Yichun, Mudanjiang and other places to specifically convey and assist in the work. The Central South Forestry Industry Administration also organized four working groups in early October to go to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces to assist in the work in depth at the production units. Guangdong Province has already overfulfilled this year's timber felling and transportation plan by 20 percent. The Guangdong Provincial Forestry Industry Administration held a general mobilization meeting of all employees on October 12, proposing a task of increasing production and practicing economy with a total value of 30 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of this year, and guaranteeing that starting from October, more than 170,000 cubic meters of timber will be allocated and 200,000 cubic meters of timber will be produced each month, exceeding the original plan by 40 percent. The bureau has now organized working groups to go to four directly affiliated log yards to understand the specific situation, formulate plans for each yard to increase production and practice economy, and launch competitions. In order to inspect, supervise, and quickly solve problems on the spot, the Ministry of Forestry recently sent four working groups, led by responsible cadres from the departments and bureaus, to the Northeast, Central South, East China, Inner Mongolia and other places to carry out work.

    全国森林工业系统展开增产节约运动
    计划增产节约四千八百多亿元
    全国森林工业系统的增产节约运动，在各级党委领导下，已全面迅速地展开。自从九月中旬中央林业部发出争取超额完成木材生产任务的指示后，各地森林工业部门都先后召开全体职工大会，进行研究和讨论，订出了增产节约计划，据初步统计，增产总值约为四千八百多亿元。
    为了贯彻增产节约计划，各地森林工业部门都采取了各种具体有效办法：首先是努力增加生产，加速调拨，争取超额完成任务。凡具备超额完成计划条件的森林工业局，都尽力利用有利条件，克服困难，增加生产。内蒙古计划增产原木九万六千多立方公尺，增加产值近六百亿元。贵州省计划增产原木三万四千立方公尺，增加产值约一百九十亿元。东北普遍实行等外原木（四等材、薪炭材）的简易加工，去掉腐朽部分，利用其可用部分。这样，可以从现有四十万立方公尺等外原木中加工出二十万立方公尺等内材（枕资及成材），增加产值八百八十亿元，增加利润四百亿元。还准备把积压的桦木一部分（两万立方公尺）制成枕木，加速资金周转。西南也将处理现有等外材一万三千多立方公尺，约值二十亿元。中南区争取超计划调拨二十四万立方公尺，可增加收入三百六十余亿元，并决定充分利用秋水溪运，把今年的产品全部运到最终集材场，完成冬季溪运工作。其次是降低成本，增加利润，清理资产，扩大收入：中南区由于降低成本（内一部分一九五二年存材，原价较低）及加工等外材为等内材，处理呆滞物资等可增加收入一千五百余亿元。华东区总计可降低成本三百四十多亿元。贵州省也将降低成本百分之十，总计约一百余亿元。全国各森林工业管理局大部未清产核资，现各地都在布置进行。西南区初步核算可增加资产和收入二百三十多亿元。通过清产核资处理积压木材和呆滞资金，华东、西北两区共可节约流动资金三百余亿元。
    为了保证增产节约任务的顺利完成，东北在九月下旬召开生产作业计划工作会议，研究了生产情况和增产节约中的问题及准备采取的措施。并建立了为掌握计划管理的调度制度和生产会议制度。东北森林工业管理局在布置任务后，负责干部并先后率领工作组分头深入吉林、伊春、牡丹江等地具体传达和帮助工作。中南区森林工业管理局也在十月初组织四个工作组去湖南、江西、广东、广西等省，深入生产单位协助工作。广东省已超额完成今年采伐和调运木材计划百分之二十，该省森林工业管理局又于十月十二日召开全体职工动员大会，提出在今年第四季度增产节约总值三百亿元的任务，并保证从十月份起，每月调拨木材十七万多立方公尺，生产木材二十万立方公尺，超过原计划百分之四十。该局现已组织工作组，分赴四个直属集材场了解具体情况，制订各场增产节约计划，展开竞赛。为了检查、督促并迅速就地解决问题，中央林业部最近派出四个工作组，由司、局负责干部率领，分赴东北、中南、华东、内蒙等地进行工作。
