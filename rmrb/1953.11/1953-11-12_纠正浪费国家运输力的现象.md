Response to Readers’ Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Correcting the Phenomenon of Wasting National Transportation Capacity
    The “Reader's Letters Summary” column on August 29th published readers' criticisms of some departments' unreasonable use of national transportation resources. We now publish excerpts from the replies of the relevant units:
    The Supervision Office of the Second Cement Plant of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau writes: The reader's criticism is correct. Our factory's short-distance and detour irrational transport of forty truckloads of cement on the railway is mainly because we lack an overall perspective and simply accommodate the requirements of the cargo owner. When we signed the second-quarter cement purchase and sales contract with Benxi Iron and Steel Company, the cargo owner wanted us to transport the goods to Benxi South Station for their convenience in picking up the goods. We were afraid that not agreeing to the cargo owner's request would affect the signing of the contract, so we agreed to change the purchase and sales contract to a consignment contract, but we did not consider that short-distance transportation would cause a waste of railway transport capacity. This is obviously wrong. In order to improve transportation work, our factory has decided not to sign short-distance consignment contracts with cargo owners in the future, and has notified Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Benxi Mining Bureau to pick up the goods themselves from September.
    The First Bridge Engineering Brigade of the Engineering Department of Harbin Railway Administration (originally written as the First Bridge Engineering Team in the criticism letter) writes: We held a review meeting based on the reader's criticism. At the meeting, material dispatcher Comrade Yang Xiufeng reviewed that in the past, he only considered how to quickly transport the materials needed on-site to the construction site and did not pay attention to the waste of national transportation resources, resulting in the situation of a small amount of goods occupying the entire truck for loading. The leaders of our team also had departmentalism and did not take care of the overall interests of the country. In addition to expressing our apologies to Dalian North Station, we also guarantee that the waste of national transportation resources will not happen again in the future.
    Harbin Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government writes: The reader Wu Jingxin's criticism of our factory's chaotic submission of consignment plans is correct. Because our factory's business trip clerk Peng Kuilin did not pay attention to the implementation of the railway's five-day consignment plan when he was responsible for sending wood, the entire railway's transportation plan was disrupted. Some employees even have the wrong idea that "it doesn't matter if you submit more plans, and there is no fine if you don't complete them." This shows that our work inspection and ideological education for on-site personnel are not enough, and we do not pay enough attention to the railway's planned transportation system. We must learn from this lesson, strengthen the education of our staff, and further improve our work to ensure the smooth completion of the national transportation plan.

### 纠正浪费国家运输力的现象

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    纠正浪费国家运输力的现象
    八月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了读者批评某些部门不合理使用国家运输力量的来信。现将各有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局第二水泥厂监察室来信：读者的批评是正确的。我厂把四十车水泥在铁路上作短距离和绕道的不合理运输，主要原因是我们缺乏整体观念，单纯迁就货主提出的要求。我们在与本溪钢铁公司签订第二季度水泥购销合同时，货主为了提货方便，要我们把货物运送到本溪南站。而我们怕不答应货主的要求会影响合同的签订，就同意将购销合同改为代运合同，却没有考虑到近距离运输会造成铁路运输力的浪费。这显然是错误的。为了改进运输工作，我厂决定今后不再与货主签订近距离的代运合同，并已通知本溪钢铁公司，本溪矿务局，自九月份起自行提运货物。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局工程处桥梁工程第一大队（原批评信中写作桥梁第一工程队）来信：我们根据读者批评，召开了一次检讨会。会上，材料发送员杨秀峰同志检讨了过去只是考虑如何把现场需要的材料迅速运送到工地，对国家运输力量的浪费却不加以重视，因而发生把少量货物占用整车装载的情况。我队领导上也存在着本位主义思想，不照顾国家的整体利益。我们除向大连北站表示歉意外，并保证今后不再发生浪费国家运输力量的情形。
    中央人民政府铁道部哈尔滨木材厂来信：读者吴景新对我厂乱提托运计划提出的批评是正确的。由于我厂出差员彭奎林在负责发送木材的工作中不重视铁路上五日托运计划的执行，以致打乱了整个铁路的运输计划。个别职工甚至还存在“多提计划没啥，完不成也不要罚款”的错误思想。这说明我们对现场人员的工作检查和思想教育是不够的，对铁路的计划运输制度是不够重视的。我们一定接受教训，加强对所属工作人员的教育，进一步改进工作，以保证国家运输计划的顺利完成。
