Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The seventh meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held on November 2nd. Mr. Ki Suk-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stated first: In their speech on October 28th, the other side made despicable slanders against Korea and China. Our side raised a serious protest against this on October 29th, and firmly demanded that the other side withdraw this serious and impolite blunder. However, the other side has not responded to our protest. Therefore, our side once again firmly demands that the other side withdraw its blunder, and declares that the Korean and Chinese representatives will never consider the matter concluded because the other side remains silent.

    In his speech, the American representative Dean still insisted on his unreasonable position, arguing that the two sides should first reach an agreement on the time and place of the political conference, and then "exchange views" on the issue of the members of the political conference. He stubbornly claimed that our insistence on adopting our reasonable agenda was delaying time and lacking sincerity.

    Mr. Ki Suk-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, immediately refuted this. He pointed out that the other side has consistently refused to determine a reasonable agenda for a week, which has prevented the talks from progressing rapidly. Therefore, the facts prove that it is the other side that lacks sincerity. Mr. Ki Suk-bok also pointed out the contradictory arguments of the other side in their speech on October 31st. He said that while the other side expressed that they did not oppose discussing the issue of the members of the political conference, they were unwilling to include it in the agenda. The other side acknowledged that a conference should have an agenda, but then suggested that the two sides should not proceed according to the order of the agenda, which is self-contradictory. He also pointed out that the other side argued that the two sides could discuss other matters without reaching an agreement on a certain item, but if the two sides could not reach an agreement on the issue of the members of the political conference, how could other issues be properly resolved? Finally, Mr. Ki Suk-bok pointed out that if the other side still intends to continue this meeting, there is no reason to refuse the reasonable and correct agenda proposed by our side, and immediately enter into the discussion on the issue of members. After Mr. Ki Suk-bok finished speaking, the American representative suggested adjourning the meeting until the 3rd, and our side agreed.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行
    我方代表坚决主张通过我方的合理议程
   【新华社开城二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二日，双方关于政治会议问题的会谈举行第七次会议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生首先表示：对方在十月二十八日的发言中，对朝、中两国进行卑鄙的谩骂，我方对此已于十月二十九日提出严重抗议，并坚决要求对方撤回这严重的无礼的失言。但对方对我方此项抗议迄未加以答复，因此我方再度坚决要求对方撤回其失言，并声明朝、中两国代表决不因对方默不作声而认为了事。
    美方代表迪安在发言中仍坚持其无理立场，主张双方先就政治会议的时间与地点达成协议，然后就政治会议的成员问题“交换意见”。他硬说我方坚持通过我方的合理议程是拖延时间而无诚意。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生当即加以驳斥。他指出：一周来对方始终拒绝确定一个合理的议程，致使会谈不能迅速进展。因此，事实证明缺乏诚意的正是对方。奇石福先生又指出对方在十月三十一日发言中的自相矛盾的论点说，对方一方面表示不反对讨论政治会议的成员问题，另一方面又不肯把它列入议程：对方承认进行会议应有议程，却又建议双方不按议程次序进行讨论，岂非自相矛盾。他又指出，对方主张双方进行讨论时无须在某一项目上达成协议，即可进行讨论其他事项，但如果双方不能在政治会议的成员问题上达成协议，又怎能恰当地解决其他问题？最后，奇石福先生指出，如果对方还有意继续进行此次会谈，就没有任何理由拒绝我方所提出的合理的正确的议程，并立即进入关于成员问题的讨论。奇石福先生发言毕，美方代表建议休会至三日，我方同意。
