Xinhua News Agency, 25th Dispatch: The American ruling clique's policy of refusing great power consultation and striving to create tension in Asia and Europe after the Korean armistice is being strongly opposed by the broad masses of people in capitalist countries. In recent months, people in various countries have further launched movements to strive for peaceful negotiation to resolve international disputes.

    A nationwide movement for peaceful consultation has been widely launched in France. People from all walks of life are demanding a great power conference to discuss the easing of international tensions and the peaceful resolution of the German question, and opposing the "European Army" treaty aimed at arming West Germany. From October 25th to November 25th, large-scale mass rallies and demonstrations have been held in various parts of France to oppose the arming of West Germany. The unanimity shown by people from all walks of life and with different political views in France in opposing the "European Army" is unprecedented since the French resistance movement against the German fascist occupation during World War II. At the same time, people from all walks of life in France are also strongly demanding an end to the war in Vietnam. A national conference for negotiations with Vietnam was held in Paris on November 22nd. Many members of the National Assembly, senators, municipal councilors, and representatives of various organizations from different parties attended the meeting. Peace committees in Isère, Loire-Cher, Seine, Bouches-du-Rhône and other provinces have launched mass signature campaigns demanding an end to the Vietnam War. In early October, Bouches-du-Rhône had already collected 135,000 signatures.

    In Britain, the call for great power consultation is also widespread. The Britain-China Friendship Association launched a campaign in September to ensure the success of the Korean political conference, which has been supported by more than 300 organizations, including trade unions and cooperatives. This movement is continuing.

    Peace advocates in Italy are preparing to launch a broad national movement to fight for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, against the arming of West Germany, and for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

    In Asia, the Japan Peace Committee held its 8th National Congress in early October, which decided to support the resolution of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting on launching a movement for great power consultation, and decided to launch a movement for international consultation in Japan. The congress also decided to hold a "National Congress for Peaceful Consultation" on November 28th and 29th. In order to vigorously promote the consultation movement, Japanese peace activists have recently launched a Japanese People's Peace Congress to be held in mid-December.

    The people of India warmly support the signature campaign for the declaration for the peaceful resolution of international disputes launched by the All-India Peace Council. 700,000 people have already signed the declaration. Trade unions and peasant associations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, East Punjab, Delhi, Bihar, and other provinces have supported this declaration. The signature campaign is continuing to expand. The Tamil Nadu Peace Committee has decided to collect 700,000 signatures for this declaration by the end of this year.

    Indonesia is actively preparing for the National Peace Congress scheduled for January next year, which will discuss the issue of launching a movement for great power consultation.

    Thousands of working people in Iraq have jointly appealed to the governments of the five major powers, the World Peace Council, and the Iraqi government, calling for the easing of international tensions.

    In the Americas, movements for peaceful consultation are also underway. Canada and Brazil are both holding national referendums for great power consultation. In Canada, preliminary results of the Toronto vote showed that 93.9 percent of voters favored peaceful resolution of international disputes. In Brazil, people of different political views are voting for great power consultation. The Guatemalan National Peace Committee is launching a movement to collect 150,000 signatures on a petition calling for a five-power conference.

    资本主义各国人民要求协商解决国际争端
    反对美国拒绝大国协商并在亚洲和欧洲制造紧张局势的政策
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国统治集团在朝鲜停战后继续执行拒绝大国协商并竭力在亚洲和欧洲制造紧张局势的政策，正遭到资本主义各国广大人民的强烈反对。近几个月来，各国人民进一步开展了争取和平协商解决国际争端的运动。
    法国全国广泛开展了争取和平协商运动。各阶层人民要求举行大国会议来讨论缓和国际紧张局势问题及和平解决德国问题，反对旨在武装西德的“欧洲军”条约。从十月二十五日到十一月二十五日，法国各地纷纷举行了规模宏大的群众集会及示威游行，反对武装西德。十一月八日，在巴黎举行了关于德国问题的全国代表会议。法国各阶层人民、各种不同政治见解的人士在反对“欧洲军”上所表现的一致，是第二次世界大战期间法国反抗德国法西斯占领的抵抗运动以来所从来没有的。同时，法国各阶层人士也在强烈要求停止越南战争。十一月二十二日在巴黎举行了争取与越南谈判全国会议。许多不同党派的国民议会议员、省参议员、市政委员以及各社团代表都参加了这个会议。伊塞尔省、罗亚—舍尔省、塞纳省、罗尼河口省等地和平委员会已经发起要求停止越南战争的群众签名运动。罗尼河口省在十月初时就已征集到十三万五千个签名。
    在英国，要求大国协商的呼声也很普遍。英中友好协会在九月间发起确使朝鲜政治会议成功的运动，已得到包括工会与合作社在内的三百多个组织的支持。这个运动还在继续开展中。
    意大利的和平拥护者正筹备在全国发动一个广泛的运动，为和平解决朝鲜问题，为反对武装西德和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而斗争。
    在亚洲，日本拥护和平委员会于十月初举行了第八届全国代表大会，大会决定支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议关于开展争取大国协商运动的决议，并决定要在日本开展争取国际协商运动。大会还决定在十一月二十八日和二十九日举行“全国争取和平协商大会”。为了大力开展协商运动，日本和平人士最近又发起在十二月中旬举行日本人民和平大会。
    印度人民热烈支持全印和平理事会所发起的和平解决国际争端宣言签名运动。已有七十万人在这个宣言上签名。泰米尔纳德、西孟加拉、喀拉拉、东旁遮普、德里、比哈尔和其他省的工会和农会等组织都支持这个宣言。签名运动在继续扩大中。泰米尔纳德和平委员会已决定在今年年底以前为这个宣言征集七十万人的签名。
    印度尼西亚正在积极筹备定于明年一月举行的全国和平大会，大会要讨论开展争取大国协商运动的问题。
    伊拉克成千劳动人民联名向五大国政府、世界和平理事会和伊拉克政府呼吁，要求缓和国际紧张局势。
    在美洲国家，争取和平协商的运动也在开展。加拿大和巴西都正在举行争取大国协商的全国公民投票。在加拿大，多伦多投票的初步结果表明，投票者中有百分之九十三点九赞成和平解决国际争端。在巴西，各种不同政治见解的人们都投票要求大国协商。危地马拉全国和平委员会正在展开一个运动，在要求召开五大国会议的呼吁书上征集十五万人的签名。
