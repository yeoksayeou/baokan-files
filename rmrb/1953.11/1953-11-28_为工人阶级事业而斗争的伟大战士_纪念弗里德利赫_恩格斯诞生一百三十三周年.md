    A Great Warrior Who Fought for the Cause of the Working Class
    -- Commemorating the 133rd Anniversary of the Birth of Friedrich Engels
    Soviet Union, A. Lihelate
    Friedrich Engels was a great warrior and mentor of the proletariat, and a close friend and comrade-in-arms of Marx. He and Marx formulated the scientific theory of communism together. Engels was born in Barmen, Germany, in November 1820.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels established the greatest scientific and revolutionary achievement. For the first time in human history, they laid the true scientific theory of social development -- Marxism. In place of various utopian ideas about ideal social institutions, they created the most advanced doctrine, which has become a powerful weapon in the hands of the proletariat to revolutionize society. Marx and Engels were the first to conclude that the working class and its demands are an inevitable product of the capitalist system, and that it is this most revolutionary class that will become the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new socialist society. They scientifically demonstrated that only the class struggle of the organized proletariat, not the good intentions of individual outstanding figures, can liberate mankind from capitalist oppression.
    Marx and Engels arrived at the understanding of the revolutionary role of the proletariat as the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new society independently of each other. This illustrates the historical necessity of the emergence of the scientific worldview of the proletariat, which is determined by the economic development of capitalist society.
    When Engels lived in England in his youth, he studied the conditions of the British working class in depth and comprehensively. At the same time, he not only analyzed official documents and extensive works, but also often went to working-class areas himself, visited workers' simple dwellings and talked with them. Based on these observations and studies, Engels wrote the book "The Condition of the Working Class in England."
    In this book, Engels first pointed out that the proletariat is not only a suffering class, but that it is precisely the shameful economic position of this class that will inevitably push this class forward, making it fight for its ultimate liberation.
    At the end of August 1844, Engels returned to Germany from England. On the way, he visited Paris, where he met Marx. This meeting laid the foundation for their great friendship. Lenin wrote about this that this meeting exceeded "the story of the most moving friendship in all ancient tales." (Lenin, "On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, Chinese edition, p. 52)
    In 1845, Marx and Engels published their joint work "The Holy Family," in which they elaborated on the foundations of the proletarian worldview. During the period from 1845 to 1848, Engels lived in Brussels and Paris.
    Here, in close cooperation with Karl Marx, he carried out enormous scientific work and linked this work with practical activities among the workers. It was at this time that Marx and Engels jointly wrote the great work "The German Ideology," in which they criticized various ideological systems explaining nature and society, and at the same time criticized the shortcomings of Feuerbach's philosophy. It was in this work that they elucidated the main principles of the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels linked the study of theoretical problems with the revolutionary practical activities related to uniting the advanced representatives of the working class and establishing the foundation of a proletarian party. In 1847, they participated in a secret German organization called the "Communist League." Commissioned by this organization, Marx and Engels wrote the "League's" program, in which they expounded the foundation of their doctrine. This is how the famous work "The Communist Manifesto" came into being. V.I. Lenin said that the value of this thin book is very significant, because in this book "the new worldview is described with genius, thoroughness and clarity, that is, thorough materialism, including social life, dialectics as the most complete and profound doctrine of development, the doctrine of class struggle, and the world-historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat, the creator of a new communist society." (See Lenin, "Karl Marx," Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House, Chinese edition, p. 9) In "The Communist Manifesto," Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels announced the inevitable death of capitalism and the inevitable victory of the working class, the victory of socialism. In this programmatic document of Marxism, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was put forward for the first time.
    During the European Revolution of 1848-1849, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels returned to their homeland -- Germany. They started publishing the "New Rhineland News" in Cologne. In the "New Rhineland News," they spoke out as true and fearless defenders of the interests of the people, and fought to eliminate the autocratic serfdom and reactionary organs in Germany. Friedrich Engels personally participated in the armed uprising of the people in the Rhineland. After the uprising was suppressed, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels fled to England. During the period in London, they completed many outstanding works, such as Karl Marx's "Das Kapital," Friedrich Engels' "Anti-DÃ¼hring," and "Dialectics of Nature," etc.
    In 1864, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels laid the foundation for the international organization of workers -- the First International, and led this organization for ten years. Under their leadership, the First International played a huge role in the development of the international workers' movement. Marx and Engels waged a tenacious struggle against the enemies of the First International, because these enemies denied the necessity of class struggle and the forcible overthrow of the capitalist system.
    In 1871, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did everything possible to support the heroic fighters of the Paris Commune, who were the first to realize the ideals of the First International through armed uprising. When they summarized the experience of the Paris Commune and explained its historical significance, they made the extremely important conclusion that the bourgeois state machine must be smashed and replaced by a proletarian state of the Paris Commune type.
    After the failure of the Paris Commune in 1871, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels placed great hope on Russia, where the democratic revolution had matured and the proletariat had grown rapidly. They saw in Russia the power that could break the old system by revolutionary means and establish a new proletarian state. The great October Socialist Revolution did not disappoint the hopes of the two great leaders of the working class.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did a lot of research on China, and at the same time they watched the Chinese people's struggle against foreign enslavers with undiminished concern and sympathy. When Marx and Engels recorded the events that took place in China in 1840, they angrily exposed those British capitalists who took military action against the Chinese people in order to enrich themselves by importing large quantities of opium.
    The unequal treaties imposed on China as a result of the Opium War in 1840 aroused many anti-imperialist remarks. These remarks were the prelude to the great peasant war in China in the mid-19th century -- the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising.
    When analyzing the nature of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, Marx and Engels saw the awakening of the lower-level people, their strong hatred for the enslavers, and their yearning for freedom. They fully stood on the side of the peasant masses in the uprising.
    Marx and Engels believed that since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, the Chinese empire had faced "the eve of social change, which in any case should have very important results for civilization."
    The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising suffered defeat. Without the leadership of the proletariat, the peasants could not undertake the task of establishing a new social system and expelling foreign enslavers, but the peasants also laid the foundation for future generations to struggle more smoothly.
    Based on the analysis of the internal situation in China at that time, Marx and Engels brilliantly predicted that there would be years when the following inscription would appear in front of the imperial palace gate "leading to the most conservative fortress": "Republic of China, Freedom, Equality, Fraternity." These predictions of the great leaders of the working class have come true. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have freed themselves from feudal oppression and the rule of foreign imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, and are now advancing smoothly along the path pointed out by these two great geniuses of mankind.
    After the death of his best friend Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels corresponded extensively with almost all workers' activists in various countries. He relentlessly fought against opportunism in various workers' parties, exposed and severely criticized the mistakes of these parties, and pointed out the revolutionary direction for their work.
    From the beginning of his political activities until his death, Friedrich Engels was an enthusiastic revolutionary leader of the international proletariat and the best expression of the class interests of the proletariat.
    In the 1890s, Lenin, and later Stalin, the great successors of Marx and Engels' cause, stepped onto the stage of political struggle in Russia. In the new historical conditions after the death of Marx and Engels, under imperialism, Lenin and Stalin defended Marxism from various infringements by opportunists and adapted it to the new conditions of the proletariat's class struggle. Lenin and Stalin enriched and developed the theory of Marxism. Leninism, as the direct successor of Marxism in the new historical conditions, grew up and formed as Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.
    Based on a profound scientific analysis of imperialism, Lenin creatively developed Marxism, created and demonstrated the theory of socialist revolution, and the theory that socialism may first win in some countries, or even in one individual country. This brilliant discovery had a decisive influence on the socialist revolution in Russia.
    The Communist Party led by Lenin and Stalin led the working class and the poorest peasants in Russia to the victory of the socialist revolution in October 1917 and established the dictatorship of the proletariat. The chains of imperialism were first broken in Russia. The great October Socialist Revolution laid the foundation for a new era in human history -- the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution is a new devastating blow to the world imperialist system and a great victory for Marxist-Leninist ideology.
    The Soviet working people are successfully building a communist society under the banner of Marxist-Leninist ideology. Marxist-Leninism is the guiding light for the people's democratic countries to build a new life on the basis of socialism, and it is also the guiding light for the working masses in capitalist countries to engage in the struggle for peace and democracy.
