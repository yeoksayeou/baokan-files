    A Great Warrior Who Fought for the Cause of the Working Class
    -- Commemorating the 133rd Anniversary of the Birth of Friedrich Engels
    Soviet Union, A. Lihelate
    Friedrich Engels was a great warrior and mentor of the proletariat, and a close friend and comrade-in-arms of Marx. He and Marx formulated the scientific theory of communism together. Engels was born in Barmen, Germany, in November 1820.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels established the greatest scientific and revolutionary achievement. For the first time in human history, they laid the true scientific theory of social development -- Marxism. In place of various utopian ideas about ideal social institutions, they created the most advanced doctrine, which has become a powerful weapon in the hands of the proletariat to revolutionize society. Marx and Engels were the first to conclude that the working class and its demands are an inevitable product of the capitalist system, and that it is this most revolutionary class that will become the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new socialist society. They scientifically demonstrated that only the class struggle of the organized proletariat, not the good intentions of individual outstanding figures, can liberate mankind from capitalist oppression.
    Marx and Engels arrived at the understanding of the revolutionary role of the proletariat as the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new society independently of each other. This illustrates the historical necessity of the emergence of the scientific worldview of the proletariat, which is determined by the economic development of capitalist society.
    When Engels lived in England in his youth, he studied the conditions of the British working class in depth and comprehensively. At the same time, he not only analyzed official documents and extensive works, but also often went to working-class areas himself, visited workers' simple dwellings and talked with them. Based on these observations and studies, Engels wrote the book "The Condition of the Working Class in England."
    In this book, Engels first pointed out that the proletariat is not only a suffering class, but that it is precisely the shameful economic position of this class that will inevitably push this class forward, making it fight for its ultimate liberation.
    At the end of August 1844, Engels returned to Germany from England. On the way, he visited Paris, where he met Marx. This meeting laid the foundation for their great friendship. Lenin wrote about this that this meeting exceeded "the story of the most moving friendship in all ancient tales." (Lenin, "On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, Chinese edition, p. 52)
    In 1845, Marx and Engels published their joint work "The Holy Family," in which they elaborated on the foundations of the proletarian worldview. During the period from 1845 to 1848, Engels lived in Brussels and Paris.
    Here, in close cooperation with Karl Marx, he carried out enormous scientific work and linked this work with practical activities among the workers. It was at this time that Marx and Engels jointly wrote the great work "The German Ideology," in which they criticized various ideological systems explaining nature and society, and at the same time criticized the shortcomings of Feuerbach's philosophy. It was in this work that they elucidated the main principles of the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels linked the study of theoretical problems with the revolutionary practical activities related to uniting the advanced representatives of the working class and establishing the foundation of a proletarian party. In 1847, they participated in a secret German organization called the "Communist League." Commissioned by this organization, Marx and Engels wrote the "League's" program, in which they expounded the foundation of their doctrine. This is how the famous work "The Communist Manifesto" came into being. V.I. Lenin said that the value of this thin book is very significant, because in this book "the new worldview is described with genius, thoroughness and clarity, that is, thorough materialism, including social life, dialectics as the most complete and profound doctrine of development, the doctrine of class struggle, and the world-historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat, the creator of a new communist society." (See Lenin, "Karl Marx," Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House, Chinese edition, p. 9) In "The Communist Manifesto," Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels announced the inevitable death of capitalism and the inevitable victory of the working class, the victory of socialism. In this programmatic document of Marxism, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was put forward for the first time.
    During the European Revolution of 1848-1849, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels returned to their homeland -- Germany. They started publishing the "New Rhineland News" in Cologne. In the "New Rhineland News," they spoke out as true and fearless defenders of the interests of the people, and fought to eliminate the autocratic serfdom and reactionary organs in Germany. Friedrich Engels personally participated in the armed uprising of the people in the Rhineland. After the uprising was suppressed, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels fled to England. During the period in London, they completed many outstanding works, such as Karl Marx's "Das Kapital," Friedrich Engels' "Anti-Dühring," and "Dialectics of Nature," etc.
    In 1864, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels laid the foundation for the international organization of workers -- the First International, and led this organization for ten years. Under their leadership, the First International played a huge role in the development of the international workers' movement. Marx and Engels waged a tenacious struggle against the enemies of the First International, because these enemies denied the necessity of class struggle and the forcible overthrow of the capitalist system.
    In 1871, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did everything possible to support the heroic fighters of the Paris Commune, who were the first to realize the ideals of the First International through armed uprising. When they summarized the experience of the Paris Commune and explained its historical significance, they made the extremely important conclusion that the bourgeois state machine must be smashed and replaced by a proletarian state of the Paris Commune type.
    After the failure of the Paris Commune in 1871, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels placed great hope on Russia, where the democratic revolution had matured and the proletariat had grown rapidly. They saw in Russia the power that could break the old system by revolutionary means and establish a new proletarian state. The great October Socialist Revolution did not disappoint the hopes of the two great leaders of the working class.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did a lot of research on China, and at the same time they watched the Chinese people's struggle against foreign enslavers with undiminished concern and sympathy. When Marx and Engels recorded the events that took place in China in 1840, they angrily exposed those British capitalists who took military action against the Chinese people in order to enrich themselves by importing large quantities of opium.
    The unequal treaties imposed on China as a result of the Opium War in 1840 aroused many anti-imperialist remarks. These remarks were the prelude to the great peasant war in China in the mid-19th century -- the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising.
    When analyzing the nature of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, Marx and Engels saw the awakening of the lower-level people, their strong hatred for the enslavers, and their yearning for freedom. They fully stood on the side of the peasant masses in the uprising.
    Marx and Engels believed that since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, the Chinese empire had faced "the eve of social change, which in any case should have very important results for civilization."
    The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising suffered defeat. Without the leadership of the proletariat, the peasants could not undertake the task of establishing a new social system and expelling foreign enslavers, but the peasants also laid the foundation for future generations to struggle more smoothly.
    Based on the analysis of the internal situation in China at that time, Marx and Engels brilliantly predicted that there would be years when the following inscription would appear in front of the imperial palace gate "leading to the most conservative fortress": "Republic of China, Freedom, Equality, Fraternity." These predictions of the great leaders of the working class have come true. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have freed themselves from feudal oppression and the rule of foreign imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, and are now advancing smoothly along the path pointed out by these two great geniuses of mankind.
    After the death of his best friend Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels corresponded extensively with almost all workers' activists in various countries. He relentlessly fought against opportunism in various workers' parties, exposed and severely criticized the mistakes of these parties, and pointed out the revolutionary direction for their work.
    From the beginning of his political activities until his death, Friedrich Engels was an enthusiastic revolutionary leader of the international proletariat and the best expression of the class interests of the proletariat.
    In the 1890s, Lenin, and later Stalin, the great successors of Marx and Engels' cause, stepped onto the stage of political struggle in Russia. In the new historical conditions after the death of Marx and Engels, under imperialism, Lenin and Stalin defended Marxism from various infringements by opportunists and adapted it to the new conditions of the proletariat's class struggle. Lenin and Stalin enriched and developed the theory of Marxism. Leninism, as the direct successor of Marxism in the new historical conditions, grew up and formed as Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.
    Based on a profound scientific analysis of imperialism, Lenin creatively developed Marxism, created and demonstrated the theory of socialist revolution, and the theory that socialism may first win in some countries, or even in one individual country. This brilliant discovery had a decisive influence on the socialist revolution in Russia.
    The Communist Party led by Lenin and Stalin led the working class and the poorest peasants in Russia to the victory of the socialist revolution in October 1917 and established the dictatorship of the proletariat. The chains of imperialism were first broken in Russia. The great October Socialist Revolution laid the foundation for a new era in human history -- the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution is a new devastating blow to the world imperialist system and a great victory for Marxist-Leninist ideology.
    The Soviet working people are successfully building a communist society under the banner of Marxist-Leninist ideology. Marxist-Leninism is the guiding light for the people's democratic countries to build a new life on the basis of socialism, and it is also the guiding light for the working masses in capitalist countries to engage in the struggle for peace and democracy.

    为工人阶级事业而斗争的伟大战士
    ——纪念弗里德利赫·恩格斯诞生一百三十三周年
    苏联　阿·李赫拉特
    弗里德利赫·恩格斯是无产阶级的伟大战士和导师，马克思的挚友和战友。他同马克思一起制定了科学的共产主义理论。恩格斯于一八二○年十一月诞生在德国的巴门城。
    卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯建立了最伟大的科学的和革命的功绩。他们在人类史上第一次奠定了社会发展的真正的科学理论——马克思主义。在关于理想的社会机构的各种乌托邦思想的地位上，他们创立了最先进的学说，这个学说在无产阶级手中已成为对社会进行革命改造的强有力的武器了。马克思和恩格斯第一次作出了结论，认为工人阶级及其要求是资本主义制度的必然产物，而且正是这个最革命的阶级将成为资本主义的掘墓人和新的社会主义社会的创建者。他们科学地论证了这么一点：能够把人类从资本主义压迫下解放出来的只是有组织的无产阶级的阶级斗争，并不是个别杰出人物的善良意图。
    马克思和恩格斯对于作为资本主义的掘墓人和新社会的创建者的无产阶级的革命作用的理解，是各自独立地得出的。这就说明了那以资本主义社会的经济发展所决定的、无产阶级的科学世界观的出现的历史必然性。
    恩格斯在他青年时代住在英国的时候，早就深刻地、全面地研究了英国工人阶级的状况。同时，他不仅分析了官方的文件和广泛的著作，而且还常常亲自前往工人区，访问工人的简陋住宅并和他们谈话。根据这些观察和研究，恩格斯写了“英国工人阶级底状况”一书。
    在这本书中，恩格斯首先指出，无产阶级不只是一个受苦的阶级，而且正是这个阶级所处的耻辱的经济地位，才必然会推使这个阶级前进，使它为争取自己的最终解放而斗争。
    一八四四年八月底，恩格斯从英国回到德国。途中他访问了巴黎，并在那里会到马克思。这一次会见奠定了他们之间伟大友谊的基础。列宁曾就这事写道，这次会见超过了“一切古谭中最令人感动的友谊的故事”。（列宁著“论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义”，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局，中文版第五十二页）
      一八四五年，马克思和恩格斯出版了他们合写的“神圣的家族”，他们在这本书中阐述了无产阶级世界观的基础。在一八四五—一八四八年一段时期中，恩格斯一直住在布鲁塞尔和巴黎。
    在这里，他在和卡·马克思的紧密合作下进行了巨大的科学工作，并把这种工作和在工人之间的实际活动联系起来。就在这个时间，马克思和恩格斯共同写成了“德意志的思想体系”这一伟大名著，在这部著作中批判了各种解释自然和社会的思想体系，同时批判了费尔巴哈哲学的缺点。就在这部作品中，他们阐明了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义理论的主要原理。
    卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯把理论问题的研究工作和有关团结工人阶级的先进代表、建立无产阶级政党的基础的革命的实际活动联系在一起。一八四七年，他们参加了名为“共产主义者同盟”的秘密的德国团体。根据这个团体的委托，马克思和恩格斯写成了“同盟”的纲领，在这个纲领中阐明了自己的学说基础。“共产党宣言”这部有名的著作就这样产生了。弗·伊·列宁曾说过，这本薄薄的小书的价值是非常重大的，因为在这部书里“用天才透彻鲜明的笔调叙述了新的世界观，即包括有社会生活在内的彻底唯物论，作为最完备最精深发展观的辩证法，论阶级斗争和共产主义新社会创造者无产阶级所负全世界历史革命使命的学说”。（见列宁著“卡尔·马克思”，苏联外国文书籍出版局，中文版第九页）卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中宣布了资本主义必然死亡和工人阶级不可避免的胜利，社会主义的胜利。在这部马克思主义的纲领性的文献中，初次提出了无产阶级专政的思想。
    一八四八年—一八四九年欧洲革命的时候，卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯回到了祖国——德国。他们在科伦开始出版“新莱茵报”。他们在“新莱茵报”上以人民利益的真正的和无畏的保卫者的身分发表言论，曾为消灭德国的专制的农奴制度和反动的机关而战斗。弗·恩格斯亲身参加了莱茵省的人民武装起义。起义被镇压后，卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯跑到英国去。在伦敦的时期，他们完成了许多卓越的作品，如卡·马克思的“资本论”、弗·恩格斯的“反杜林论”和“自然辩证法”等。
    一八六四年，卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯奠定了工人的国际组织——第一国际，并领导这个组织历十年之久。由于他们的领导，第一国际在国际工人运动的发展中起了巨大的作用。马克思和恩格斯向反对第一国际的敌人进行了顽强斗争，因为这些敌人否认阶级斗争和武力推翻资本主义制度的必然性。
    在一八七一年，卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯曾尽一切力量来支援最初武装起义要实现第一国际的理想的巴黎公社的英勇战士们。他们在总结了巴黎公社的经验并说明它的历史意义时，做出了必须打碎资产阶级国家机器并代之以巴黎公社型的无产阶级国家的极其重要的结论。
    在一八七一年巴黎公社失败之后，卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯把很大的希望寄托在俄国身上，那时俄国的民主革命已经成熟，同时无产阶级很快地生长起来了。他们在俄国看到了能够以革命方法打破旧制度并建立起新的无产阶级国家的那种力量。伟大的十月社会主义革命没有辜负了工人阶级两位伟大领袖的希望。
    卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯做了不少的对中国的研究工作，同时他们以毫不减弱的关切和同情注视着中国人民反对外国奴役者的斗争。马克思和恩格斯在记述中国一八四○年发生的事件时，愤怒地揭发了那些英国资本家，是为了要大量输入鸦片以致富，而对中国人民采取军事行动的。
    由于一八四零年鸦片战争结果而强加在中国身上的不平等条约，引起了许许多多反对帝国主义的言论。这些言论是十九世纪中叶中国伟大的农民战争——太平天国起义——的先声。
    马克思和恩格斯在分析太平天国起义的性质时，看出了低层人民的觉醒，看出了他们对奴役者的强烈的仇恨和对自由的热望。他们完全站在起义的农民群众方面。
    马克思和恩格斯认为，从太平天国起义时起，中国的帝国就已面临“社会变革的前夜，这种变革，无论如何都应该对文明有非常重要的成果”。
    太平天国起义遭到了失败。没有无产阶级来领导，农民是不能担负起建立新的社会制度和驱逐外国奴役者的任务的，但是，农民们却也给后世子孙更顺利的斗争奠定了基础。
    马克思和恩格斯根据对当时中国内部情况的分析，天才地预言：会有这样的年月到来，其时“通向最保守的堡垒”的皇宫门前，就要出现如下的题词：“中华共和国、自由、平等、友爱”。工人阶级的伟大领袖们的这些预言都应验了。伟大的中国人民在共产党的领导下摆脱了封建的压迫和外国帝国主义的统治，建立了中华人民共和国，现在正沿着这两位人类的伟大天才所指出的道路顺利前进。
    弗·恩格斯在他最好的朋友卡·马克思逝世之后，和各国的工人运动家几乎全都广泛地通信。他无情地和各工人政党中的机会主义作斗争，揭露和严厉地批评这些政党的错误，并给它们的工作指出革命的方向。
    弗·恩格斯从他进行政治活动的初期起到他逝世为止，一直是国际无产阶级热情的革命领袖，是无产阶级阶级利益最优秀的表达者。
    在九十年代，马克思和恩格斯事业的伟大继承者——列宁，后来还有斯大林走上了俄国政治斗争的舞台。在马克思和恩格斯逝世后的新的历史条件下，在帝国主义的条件下，列宁和斯大林保卫了马克思主义使它不受机会主义者的各种侵害，并适应于无产阶级阶级斗争的新条件。列宁和斯大林丰富和发展了马克思主义的理论。列宁主义作为马克思主义在新的历史条件下的直接继承者，作为帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义而成长起来，形成起来。
    列宁在对帝国主义进行深刻的科学分析的基础上，创造性地发展了马克思主义，创造和论证了社会主义革命的理论，关于社会主义可能在一些国家、或者甚至在一个个别国家内首先胜利的理论。这一天才的发现，对俄国的社会主义革命发生了决定性的影响。
    为列宁和斯大林所领导的共产党，领导俄国的工人阶级和最贫苦的农民在一九一七年十月走向社会主义革命的胜利，建立了无产阶级专政。在俄国首先冲破了帝国主义的锁链。伟大的十月社会主义革命，奠定了人类历史新时代——资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的时代——的基础。
    中国人民民主革命的胜利，是对世界帝国主义体系的一个新的毁灭性的打击，是马克思列宁主义思想的伟大胜利。
    苏联劳动人民正在马克思列宁主义思想的旗帜下，成功地建设着共产主义社会。马克思列宁主义是各人民民主国家在社会主义基础上建设新生活的指路明灯，也是资本主义各国劳动群众从事争取和平与民主斗争的指路明灯。
