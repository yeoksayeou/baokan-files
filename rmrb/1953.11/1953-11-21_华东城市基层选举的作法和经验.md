Many cities in East China are conducting basic-level election work. As of the end of September, 32 cities, 36 urban districts, 645 electoral districts, and 74 police stations and streets have conducted typical pilot work, of which 17 urban districts, 60 electoral districts, and 8 police stations and streets have been completed. Basic-level election work in cities such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Xiamen has been fully launched; the election work in all districts of Fuzhou City has ended; and the election work in county towns has just begun.

Cities are political, economic, and cultural centers, with dense and mobile populations, and numerous factories, enterprises, government organs, and schools. Production, work, and study times vary, and some residents' places of residence and work also differ. Political situations and class relationships are complex, and people's thoughts and demands are also different. These are the characteristics of the environment for basic-level elections in cities. Carrying out basic-level election work in cities must be based on and take these characteristics into account, otherwise deviations will occur.

The basic-level election work in various cities in East China is carried out in conjunction with production. Production is a long-term central task in both cities and rural areas, and election work must be combined with production. However, cities and rural areas differ. According to the experience of the East China region, the relationship between basic-level elections and production in cities is that election work should be carried out without hindering production, work, and study, and that elections should be used as a political driving force to promote production, work, and study. In the election campaign in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other cities, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was stimulated due to the propaganda and education about being masters of their own affairs, and many model deeds emerged. After the workers of Zhicheng Yarn Factory in Shanghai improved their awareness in the general election, they improved the quality of their products; the staff of the Shanghai Cooperative Union improved their work enthusiasm in the general election. After conducting education on the concept of the state in small and medium-sized shops and enterprises in Wuxi, tax evasion and avoidance were reduced. In general, city election work teams should not directly guide production, and the combination of election work and production should not be misinterpreted as allowing the election work team to take over and solve various production problems during the election campaign, or to force production leading organs to solve production problems that cannot or should not be solved at present. Some election work teams in Wuxi arbitrarily revised the employee wage system during the election campaign, resulting in ideological confusion among workers and reduced product quality. Unified planning, deployment, and implementation of election work and production are only feasible under the condition that the heads of certain factories and enterprises directly participate in leading the election work. Lixin and Shenxin Yarn Factories in Wuxi adopted this method. After carrying out patriotic and democratic education among employees, they inspected and revised the production plan and patriotic pact, which significantly improved production efficiency and reduced the number of defective cloths and broken ends.

In carrying out basic-level election work in cities, how to divide electoral districts is a more complicated issue than dividing electoral districts in rural areas. The division of electoral districts is directly related to the nomination of representative candidates. The experience in East China is that electoral districts should be divided based on the original administrative districts according to the living conditions of voters, and it is more appropriate for each electoral district to produce two to five representatives. Government organs can be divided into separate electoral districts, and those that cannot be divided separately can be divided together with residents, but they can be compiled into separate voter groups. Large factories and schools in the suburbs are divided into separate electoral districts to elect people's representatives from the suburbs or cities without districts, and do not participate in township elections. Large construction sites can also be divided into separate electoral districts. Factories, schools, and government organs belonging to the city that are located in other counties participate in local elections. Government organs of counties located in large and medium-sized cities that do not belong to them register the population and voters in the city. Those who need to return to the county to vote are introduced by the election committee to participate in the election in their own county.

In the population survey and voter registration work, various cities in East China have adopted the following methods based on the characteristics of residents' living conditions: If the place of residence and work are the same, the population and voters are registered in one place; if the place of residence and work are different, the population is registered at the place of residence and the voters are registered at the place of work. The method of population survey and voter registration in the urban water area is to register those with residences on land on land, register those belonging to shipping companies in the shipping companies, and register private boats with water as their residences on the water. Water registration can be set up at ports, and registration can be done upon arrival. Water areas with large populations are divided into separate electoral districts, and port authorities, shipping management agencies, and shipping companies are included in the water electoral districts. After reviewing the voter qualifications registered on land, they are transferred to the water. For some ports where the mobility of ships is too large, the method of propaganda, registration, review, announcement of candidates, and election is adopted.

The work of reviewing voter qualifications is more complex and important in cities than in rural areas. All localities anticipated this situation in advance and made preparations as early as possible. Fuzhou City began preparing two and a half months before the population survey began, and some cities even earlier. The methods adopted by various cities to review voter qualifications are mostly to organize government organs, factories, and schools according to systems, and residents according to police stations, to initially clarify the issue of whether or not they have the right to vote, and then submit it to the election committee for unified review and processing. In the review, landlords who originally resided in the city and landlords' elements with a clear background, if the land reform in their place of origin has been over five years, are treated in the same way as ordinary landlords' elements in old liberated areas based on their usual performance; landlords who also have other occupations or those with other occupations and are also landlords, if they cannot be clarified for the time being, are handled in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Central Election Committee's "Answers to Several Questions Concerning Voter Qualifications." For those whose origins and class status are unclear, methods such as sending letters, sending people to investigate, explaining the policy to make them consciously confess, voter group discussions and denunciations, and seeking proof themselves when possible are adopted to clarify them. Voter groups should play a full role in reviewing voter qualifications. Zhongcheng District of Hangzhou City did a good job in this work, and the voters denounced a total of 384 hidden landlord class elements.

In the basic-level election work, many cities in East China have paid attention to conducting democratic education for basic-level cadres through this movement, improving their thinking and improving their work style. Localities generally adopted the following methods to educate and transform basic-level cadres. Nanjing, Wuxi, and other cities used evening time before the election to concentrate basic-level cadres from the party, government, and mass organizations to conduct education and organize learning, and in smaller meetings, reviewed the work style of basic-level cadres who might be elected as representatives by summarizing their work, and strengthened their ties with the people. Fuzhou, Hefei, and other cities mobilized basic-level cadres who were nominated as representative candidates but some of the masses had some opinions about them to voluntarily visit the masses, explain, and make necessary self-criticisms. Some cities also provided necessary education when discussing representative candidates. These methods are effective in raising and educating cadres and improving their work style.

The nomination of representative candidates in various cities in East China is mostly done under the condition of ensuring the leadership of the working class, taking into account the broadness of the representatives and the characteristics of different regions, so that all social strata and nationalities have representative quotas in the People's Congress that are commensurate with their status; and attention is also paid to the quota of women representatives. The nomination methods adopted by various localities are the joint nomination methods stipulated in the Central Election Committee's "Instructions on Basic-Level Election Work" by the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations. Before the joint nomination, many cities in East China first passed the joint nomination method among the voters, and criticized old democratic ideas in the propaganda. Before the joint nomination, the candidates to be nominated were brewed among the voters, and after the nomination, full discussions were held in the voter groups, and then the list of formal representative candidates was determined. When carrying out the nomination of representative candidates, representatives of all parties are allowed to choose one place for nomination at the place of residence, place of work, place of organization, or place of part-time job, and if necessary, they can also participate in the nomination in other electoral districts in the same urban area of the city. The nominated candidates are verbally introduced by representatives of their respective organizations and units at the voter group leader meetings. Generally, only history and main deeds are mentioned during the introduction. In some places, the representative candidates directly made self-introductions at the voter group meetings, including their own history, work shortcomings (focusing on issues related to the local masses), and future efforts. These materials introduced by the representative candidates and the guarantees made were recorded and kept by the district people's government for file preservation as a basis for the people to inspect the representatives' work in the future.

The election methods of various cities in East China are determined based on the different characteristics of voters' production, work, and study time, literacy level, and the size of the electoral district, starting from the convenience of voters. The election methods are generally a combination of raising hands and voting. At the election meeting, each voter is issued several blank ballot papers stamped and dated, and the number of ballot papers is equal to the number of candidates; for each candidate elected, the voters raise their hands with a ballot paper if they agree, and the vote supervisors of each group collect the ballot papers and put them into the ballot box of each candidate, and the statistics are announced on the spot. In places with many voters, this method can avoid the difficulties and drawbacks of counting the number of raised hands; for small electoral districts with few voters, the method of raising hands is adopted; for government organs and schools, the method of secret ballot is mostly adopted. In addition, if the voters' working time is consistent and there are suitable places, a general meeting is held for one-time election; if the working time is inconsistent, it is carried out in batches and in different places; for large electoral districts with inconsistent working hours and most voters are literate, the method of setting up polling stations is adopted for elections.

Due to various reasons, the proportion of voters participating in elections in government organs is smaller than that of residents, so leading cadres of government organs should attach importance to and focus on this work. After the Fuzhou City and Hangzhou City convened meetings of government organ cadres by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government and clearly explained the tasks, the election work of government organs was easier to do. Leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial People's Government personally went to the station to register and participate in the election. All staff members (voters) of the Provincial Government organs, except for those who were away, participated in the election.

    华东城市基层选举的作法和经验
    华东行政委员会普选办公室主任  邢子陶
    华东许多城市正在进行基层选举工作。截至九月底止，共有三十二个市的三十六个市区、六百四十五个选区、七十四个派出所和街道进行了典型试办工作，其中已完成的共有十七个市区、六十个选区、八个派出所和街道。南京、无锡、济南、青岛、杭州、蚌埠、厦门等市基层选举工作已全面展开；福州市各市区选举工作已经结束；县的城区的选举工作刚在开始。
    城市是政治、经济、文化的中心，人口集中、流动频繁，工厂、企业、机关、学校众多，生产、工作和学习的时间不一致，部分居民居住地点和工作地点亦不一致。政治情况与阶级、阶层关系复杂，人们的思想和要求也各有不同。这些就是城市基层选举的环境特点。进行城市基层选举工作，必须依据和照顾这些特点，否则将会发生偏差。
    华东各城市的基层选举工作都是结合生产进行的。生产在城市和农村都是长期的中心任务，普选工作必须结合生产。但城市与农村有所不同。根据华东区的经验，城市中基层选举和生产的关系，选举工作是要在不妨碍生产、工作和学习的条件下进行，并以普选作为政治动力推进生产、工作和学习。上海、无锡等城市在普选运动中，由于进行了当家做主的宣传教育，激发了工人的劳动热情，出现了不少模范事迹。上海市志成纱厂工人在普选中觉悟提高，改进了产品质量；上海市合作社联合社的工作人员在普选中提高了工作积极性。无锡市对分散的小型的商店和企业中进行国家观念的教育之后，减少了偷税漏税的行为。城市普选工作队一般不宜直接指导生产，普选工作结合生产也不能误解为在普选运动中就可以由普选工作组去包办代替解决生产上的各种问题，或者勉强生产领导机关去解决目前不能解决也不应解决的生产问题。无锡有的普选工作组曾在普选运动中擅自改订职工工资制度，结果引起工人思想混乱，产品质量降低。普选工作和生产统一计划、部署和贯彻，只能是在某些工厂企业单位负责人直接参加领导普选工作的条件下才是可行的。无锡市丽新、申新纱厂都是采取这种办法，在向职工进行普选爱国民主教育之后，检查并修订了生产计划和爱国公约，生产效率有显著提高，次布、断头减少。
    在城市中进行基层选举工作，如何划分选区是比农村划分选区更为复杂的问题。选区的划分直接关系到代表候选人的提出。华东区的经验是：选区按照选民居住情况以原来的行政区作为基础划分，每个选区产生两个到五个代表较为合适。机关可以单独划成选区的单独划，不能单独划的和居民一起划，但可以单独编选民小组。郊区大的工厂、学校单独划选区，选举郊区的或不设区的市的人民代表，而不参加乡镇选举。大的建筑工地，也可以单独划分选区。属于市的工厂、学校、机关，设在其他县境的，参加当地的选举。县的机关设在非所属的大中城市的，则在城市进行人口和选民登记，需要回县选举的人，由选举委员会介绍回本县参加选举。
    在人口调查和选民登记工作中，华东各城市根据居民居住情况特点，采取如下办法：居住地点和工作地点一致的，人口和选民在一处登记，居住地点和工作地点不一致的，在居住地点登记人口，在工作地点登记选民。城市水上区人口调查和选民登记的方法，是陆上有居住地点的在陆上登记，属于轮船公司的在轮船公司登记，以水上为住所的民船在水上登记。水上登记可按港口设站，随到随登记，水上人口多的单独划分选区，港务局、航务管理机构、轮船公司等划入水上选区。选民资格在陆上登记的，审查后转至水上。某些港口船只流动性太大的，则采取边来边宣传、边登记、边审查、边公布候选人、边选举的方法。
    选民资格审查工作，城市比农村更为复杂和重要。各地事先估计到这一情况，都及早作好准备工作。福州市在人口调查开始前两个半月即进行准备工作，有的市甚至更早。各城市审查选民资格的方法，多是采取机关、工厂、学校按系统排队，居民按派出所排队，初步弄清有无选举权利的问题，然后交由选举委员会统一审查处理的办法。在审查中，对原来居住本市的地主和来历清楚的地主阶级分子，如果原籍土地改革已过五年，按照其平日的表现，和老解放区农村处理一般地主阶级分子的办法同样处理；地主兼其他职业或其他职业兼地主的分子，一时弄不清楚的，按照中央选举委员会“关于选民资格若干问题的解答”第五条第三段的规定处理。来历和成份不清的分子，采取去信、派人调查、讲明政策使其自觉交代、选民小组讨论揭发、可能时自找证明等办法加以弄清。审查选民资格，应当充分发挥选民小组的作用。杭州市中城区在这个工作中作得较好，选民共揭发了三百八十四个隐藏的地主阶级分子。
    在基层选举工作中，华东区许多城市都注意通过这一运动对基层干部进行民主教育，提高他们的思想和改进他们的作风。各地对于基层干部进行教育和改造，一般采取了下述几种办法。南京、无锡等市在普选前利用晚上的时间，分别集中党、政、群众团体各系统的基层干部，进行了教育和组织了学习，并在较小的会议上，通过总结工作的方式，检查了可能当选为代表的基层干部的作风，加强了他们与人民的联系。福州、合肥等市，对于被提名为代表候选人而部分群众对他有些意见的基层干部，动员他们自动到群众中进行访问、解释和作必要的检讨。有的市则在讨论代表候选人时给以必要的教育。这些办法，对于提高和教育干部、改进干部的作风，都是行之有效的。
    华东各城市代表候选人的提名工作，多是在保证工人阶级领导的条件下，照顾代表的广泛性和不同的地区的特点，使社会各阶层、各民族都在人民代表大会中有与其地位相适应的代表名额；而且也注意到妇女代表的名额。各地提名的方法，是采取中央选举委员会“关于基层选举工作的指示”中所规定的由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体联合提名的方法。联合提名之前，华东许多城市都先把联合提名的方法在选民中通过，并在宣传中批判旧民主主义思想。在联合提名之前，都在选民中酝酿提名的人选，提名后再在选民小组中进行充分的讨论，然后确定正式代表候选人名单。进行代表候选人提名工作时，允许各方面的代表人物在居住地点、工作地点、团体所在地、兼职地点选择一处提名，必要时也可以在本市同一市区内的其他选区参加提名。被提名的候选人，都是由所属团体和单位的代表在选民小组长会议上进行口头介绍。介绍时一般只讲历史和主要事迹。有的地方还由代表候选人在选民小组会上直接作自我介绍，内容包括本身历史、工作缺点（着重和当地群众有关系的问题），和今后努力方向。代表候选人所介绍的这些材料和提出的保证，都记录下来，并交区人民政府存档保存，作为今后人民检查代表工作的一种依据。
    华东各城市的选举方法，都是根据选民生产、工作、学习时间，文化程度，选区大小等不同特点，从便利选民为出发点来决定的。选举的方法，一般的是采取举手和投票相结合的方法，在选举大会上发给每一选民几张白纸盖印并注明日期的选票，选票数量与候选人数相等；每选举一个候选人，选民如同意，就拿着一张选票举手，由各组的监票人将票收齐投入各该候选人的票箱，当场统计公布。在选民多的场合，这一方法可以避免数举手人数的困难和弊病；选区小、选民少的则采取举手方法；机关、学校多采取无记名投票方法。此外，选民工作时间一致并有适当场所的，开大会一次选举；工作时间不一致的，分地分批进行；选区大、工作时间不一致、多数选民识字的，则采取设站投票方法选举。
    机关选举因为各种原因，参加选举的选民比例比居民为小，因此机关领导干部应当重视和抓紧这一工作。福州市和杭州市在中共省委和省人民政府召开了机关干部会，明确交代任务之后，机关的选举工作就好作了。山东省人民政府领导干部亲自到站登记，参加选举，省府机关工作人员（选民）除外出者外，全部参加了选举。
