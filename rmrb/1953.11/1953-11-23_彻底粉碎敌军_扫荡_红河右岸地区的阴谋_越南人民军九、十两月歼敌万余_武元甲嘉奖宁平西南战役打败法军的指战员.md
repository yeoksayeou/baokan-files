Xinhua News Agency, dated 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on the 19th, announcing that in September and October, the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas annihilated three enemy battalions and twenty-two companies in the Red River right bank area of North Vietnam, killing and capturing 8,106 enemy troops and wounding approximately 2,000, including 100 officers of various ranks. The People's Army seized 1,147 weapons of various types and a large quantity of ammunition and equipment; shot down four enemy aircraft and severely damaged nine; and destroyed 100 enemy armored vehicles and trucks.

The communique stated: In September and October this year, the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Red River right bank area. In order to counter the guerrilla warfare and disrupt our autumn-winter offensive plan, the enemy repeatedly mobilized mobile forces to "sweep" the Red River right bank area and attempted to "pacify" the southern part of Nam Dinh province. On October 15th, the enemy even mobilized five mobile regiments to invade the southwestern liberated area of Ninh Binh.

However, the People's Army inflicted heavy blows on the French invading army. During this period, the People's Army and guerrillas in Nam Dinh Province launched annihilating offensives against the enemy, wiping out many lightly-equipped units of the puppet army. On October 18th alone, the 703rd and 707th light infantry battalions of the puppet army were completely annihilated in Van Ly, Nam Dinh Province. In two months, the People's Army and guerrillas annihilated a total of eleven companies and two battalions of the enemy in southern Nam Dinh Province. Although the enemy repeatedly reinforced them, they were unable to save the low morale of the puppet army's light infantry units. A large number of puppet soldiers had deserted or refused to participate in the "sweeping" operations.

On the main battlefield in southwestern Ninh Binh, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated one invading enemy battalion and more than eleven companies, most of which belonged to the elite 1st and 7th Mobile Groups of European and African soldiers. After suffering these serious losses, the enemy was forced to withdraw from southwestern Ninh Binh on November 6th.

The communique pointed out: After two months of tenacious fighting, the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas in the Red River right bank area have successfully crushed the enemy's conspiracy to "pacify" southern Nam Dinh Province and completely shattered Navarre's offensive against southwestern Ninh Binh.

Xinhua News Agency: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, recently sent a telegram to commend the commanders and fighters of the People's Army regular units who defeated the French invading army in southwestern Ninh Binh. The telegram said:

At the beginning of this autumn-winter campaign, the enemy concentrated their mobile forces to invade the southwestern liberated area of Ninh Binh, attempting to destroy our rear and gain military initiative. Although the enemy concentrated a large number of elite troops on this front and dispatched many artillery, motorized units and aircraft, thanks to your heroic fighting, resolutely overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and seizing favorable opportunities to annihilate a large number of the enemy's effective forces, you forced them to withdraw from the liberated area. This is the first major victory we have achieved at the beginning of this autumn-winter campaign. It proves that after strengthening ideological education in the People's Army, you have made new progress.

    彻底粉碎敌军“扫荡”红河右岸地区的阴谋
    越南人民军九、十两月歼敌万余
    武元甲嘉奖宁平西南战役打败法军的指战员
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部十九日发表的公报宣布：九、十两月，越南人民军和游击队在北越红河右岸地区歼灭敌军三个营和二十二个连，毙俘敌军八千一百零六名、击伤约二千名，其中有各级军官一百名。人民军缴获各种武器一千一百四十七件和大量弹药、装备；击落敌机四架，重伤九架；击毁敌军装甲车和卡车一百辆。
    公报说：今年九、十两月间，越南人民军和游击队在红河右岸地区和敌军进行了很激烈的战斗。敌军为了对付游击战和破坏我们的秋冬攻势计划，曾多次纠集机动部队到红河右岸地区“扫荡”并企图“绥靖”南定省南部。十月十五日，敌军更纠集了五个机动团进犯宁平西南解放区。
    但是人民军给法国侵略军以沉重的打击。在这期间，南定省的人民军和游击队曾向敌军发动歼灭性的进攻，歼灭了许多伪军的轻装部队。仅十月十八日就在南定省的文里全歼伪军第七○三和第七○七的两个轻装营。两月间，人民军和游击队一共在南定省南部歼灭敌军十一个连和两个营。敌军虽然屡次增援，但没有能够挽救伪军轻装部队的低沉士气。大量的伪军已经开了小差，或者拒绝参加“扫荡”战。
    在宁平西南的主要战场上，越南人民军歼灭进犯的敌军一个营和十一个多连，其中大部分是属于精锐的第一和第七机动团的欧、非籍官兵。敌军在遭受这些严重损失后，不得不于十一月六日从宁平西南撤退。
    公报指出：经过两个月的顽强作战，红河右岸地区的越南人民军和游击队已胜利地粉碎了敌军
  “绥靖”南定省南部的阴谋，完全粉碎了纳瓦尔向宁平西南发动的攻势。
    【新华社讯】越南人民军总司令武元甲将军最近致电嘉奖在宁平西南打败法国侵略军的人民军正规部队指战员。电文说：
    在这次秋冬战役之初，敌人曾集中他们的机动部队进犯宁平西南解放区，企图破坏我们的后方和取得军事主动权。虽然敌人在这条战线上集中了大量的精锐部队，并出动了许多炮兵、摩托化部队和飞机，但是由于你们英勇作战，坚决克服种种困难，抓紧有利时机大量消灭了敌人的有生力量，从而迫使他们退出解放区。这是我们这次秋冬战役开始时所取得的第一个重大的胜利。它证明了在人民军加强思想教育之后，你们又有了新的进步。
