    Farmers! Actively Sell Grain to the State and Help with National Construction!
    "Listening to the Communist Party is never wrong." This is the most important political experience that Chinese farmers have gained from their long revolutionary struggle and personal life experience. During the First and Second Domestic Revolutionary Wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the broad masses of farmers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out a long and arduous struggle, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and achieved the great victory of the people's democratic revolution, establishing the People's Republic of China. In the people's revolution, the price paid by the farmers was very high; however, the oppression and suffering endured by the farmers for thousands of years were fundamentally eliminated, and the fruits of the revolutionary victory obtained by the farmers were also enormous.
    Because the great land reform movement eliminated the feudal system of exploitation, now, with the exception of a few ethnic minority areas, more than 300 million landless and land-poor farmers have been allocated approximately 700 million mu of land, as well as a large number of livestock, farm implements, grain, and other means of production. Before the land reform, the rent exploited from farmers for tilling landlords' land, if converted into grain, was no less than 100 billion jin per year. The abolition of this feudal exploitation created favorable conditions for the development of agricultural productive forces and greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. In order to develop production, the People's Government has also implemented various policies beneficial to farmers, the first of which is a fair and reasonable burden policy. The state not only stipulates "no tax increase for increased production," but also stipulates that "in the next three years, the collection target of agricultural tax should be stabilized at the actual collection level in 1952." This means that although agricultural production is developing year by year, and the state's demand for crops, especially grain, is increasing year by year, in the next few years, the state will not increase the burden on farmers, but will adopt the method of purchasing to obtain the grain needed by the state. In order to help farmers develop production, the People's Government has issued a large amount of agricultural loans, provided technical guidance in many aspects, and built large-scale water conservancy projects over the years. According to statistics, the agricultural loans issued by the state this year, including accumulated figures from the past few years, totaled 10 trillion yuan; the funds used by the state for water conservancy construction totaled more than 12 trillion yuan. These have played a significant role in helping farmers develop agricultural production and overcome natural disasters. The People's Government has also adopted a price policy beneficial to farmers. The result of this policy implemented in recent years has completely changed the phenomenon of "low grain prices hurting farmers" and "disasters in good harvests" before liberation. At the same time, the state's commercial departments vigorously carried out the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and promoted the sale of farmers' local and special products on a large scale. This has also greatly increased farmers' income. According to surveys, local and special products account for about one-third of farmers' total income, and due to the increase in prices, the benefits farmers have gained in this regard have increased by about one-half compared to before liberation.
    Due to the correct policies adopted by our country and the high enthusiasm for production among the broad masses of farmers, agricultural production in our country has rapidly exceeded the pre-liberation level. Last year's grain output was equivalent to 145 percent of 1949, and cotton output was equivalent to 291 percent of 1949. This year's grain output, although affected by natural disasters in a few areas, is still no lower than last year's level.
    However, in order to further develop agriculture, to make agricultural products meet the ever-growing needs of the state and the people, and to truly enrich the lives of farmers, industry must be greatly developed. With developed industry, many mines and factories can be opened, large quantities of new farm implements, new fertilizers, and pest control machinery can be produced, large-scale water conservancy projects can be established to help agricultural cooperation, and more railways, highways, automobiles, and ships can be built to connect urban and rural areas, so that various agricultural products can be sold to cities, while various industrial products can be supplied to farmers. In short, industry can completely change the face of the countryside and enable working farmers to enjoy happiness they have never had before. China's economy was backward in the past, and industry was extremely underdeveloped, so for a hundred years, the country was weak and the people were poor, suffering all kinds of bullying from imperialism. The Communist Party led the revolution, overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang. Many heroes and heroines shed blood and sacrificed themselves in order to build China into a socialist, industrialized, prosperous, and strong country, so that all the people of the country could have a good life forever. Therefore, after the victory of the revolution, the working class, the Communist Party, and the People's Government of our country are working hard and actively developing our country's socialist industry. It will take several five-year plans to complete the great cause of our country's industrialization.
    The cause of industrialization is not only the cause of the working class, but also the cause of the people of the whole country. Industry helps farmers, but industry cannot do without the help of farmers. First, as industry develops and the number of mines and factories increases, the number of workers and the urban population will also increase, and the amount of grain, vegetables, and other non-staple foods they need will also increase. Second, many of the raw materials needed by industry are produced by farmers, such as cotton, hemp, and silk needed by the textile industry, tobacco leaves needed by the cigarette industry, and wheat, beans, and peanuts needed by the flour and oil pressing industries. Therefore, the greatest responsibility of farmers in helping industrial construction is to produce more grain, cotton, and other agricultural products.
    But it is not enough to just produce it, it must also be sold to cooperatives and state-owned grain companies, so that it can be sold to those who really need it. If you keep it and don't sell it in order to make money, or sell it to speculative private merchants and let them disrupt the market and exploit the people, then you are turning a good thing into a bad thing, not only not helping construction, but hindering construction.
    Among all agricultural products, grain is the most important. No one can live without grain. There are now nearly 200 million people in the country who need to buy grain. This is no simple matter! This means that every household with surplus grain needs to sell a batch of surplus grain, and must sell it to the state instead of to private merchants, in order to ensure that everyone in the country has food to eat, to ensure stable prices across the country, and to ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction. Therefore, it is a great contribution for farmers to produce a large amount of grain and sell the surplus grain to the state!
    Selling grain to the state is good for the state and good for the farmers themselves. The members of the Liu Haoren mutual aid group in Daguang Village, Tangyin County, when discussing the issue of selling grain, studied and found that selling grain to the state has five benefits for farmers: (1) Stabilizing prices. Before liberation, prices changed three times a day, and farmers suffered great losses; now that the state controls grain and other materials, prices are stable, and no one needs to be afraid. (2) Guaranteeing the supply of grain to grain-deficient households. Daguang Village suffered a hailstorm in 1950, a drought in 1951, and another famine last year, but because the state controlled the grain and guaranteed the supply, no one went hungry; otherwise, people would have run away long ago. (3) Turning dead grain into live money to expand reproduction. This summer, more than 2,000 jin of wheat were sold to the state, and a large cart was repaired, a walking plow was purchased, and fine fertilizer was added, so that a bumper harvest is guaranteed in the autumn. (4) Supporting industrial construction. With the development of industry, farmers can buy cheap new farm implements and produce more grain. For example, the price of each waterwheel has been reduced from 1.93 million yuan to 1.42 million yuan, and the price of each 10-inch walking plow has been reduced from 430,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan. In the future, with further industrial development, tractors can also be used. (5) Guaranteeing national defense construction and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, so that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers can all have enough to eat. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are all farmers, and their struggle is also for protecting their homes and defending the country, protecting the fruits of victory, and is inseparable from the interests of the farmers. It can be seen that patriotic farmers understand the importance of selling grain to the state, and are able to combine personal interests with national interests, and make personal interests subordinate to national interests. Recently, patriotic farmers in various places are selling large quantities of grain to the state. The Bi Laowu mutual aid group in Jindong Township, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, sold 13,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, used the money from selling grain to repay 1.5 million yuan in agricultural loans, and deposited another 670,000 yuan in the bank to prepare to buy fertilizer next year. They also bought more than 30 pieces of farm implements to prepare for production next year. Of the 14 households in the group, 13 bought cotton cloth and made new clothes and quilts for the winter. Such examples exist everywhere and can serve as a model for other farmers to learn from.
    Some erroneous ideas should be discarded. For example, some people say:
  "Isn't it better to sell grain to private merchants for a good price?" They don't realize that this is detrimental to the state and to the farmers. In the market, unscrupulous merchants often buy grain from farmers at prices higher than the state's listed price, driving up grain prices and creating market chaos, and they profit from it. We should realize that unscrupulous merchants are the destroyers of farmers' production and life. In the past, they were the ones who cut prices in the autumn and raised prices in the spring; now they are the ones who speculate and disrupt, disrupting the state's economic plan. Patriotic farmers should never sell grain to them and be exploited by them. "Wait and see what the market is like" is also a muddled idea. It should be known that the state purchases grain based on a certain price policy, which takes into account the interests of both those who sell grain and those who buy grain, as well as the long-term interests of national construction. Therefore, grain prices should not rise or fall arbitrarily. Moreover, storing grain will turn it into a dead thing, and it will also suffer from natural consumption such as insect and rodent damage, which is far less beneficial than selling it to the state and exchanging it for means of production to expand agricultural production next year.
    Patriotic farmers! We have followed the Communist Party in the past and have already achieved the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution. Now, in order to gradually transition our country to socialism, we must continue to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization under the leadership of the Communist Party, realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and build our motherland into a prosperous and strong country like the Soviet Union. Only such a country can enable farmers to completely turn over and make their lives better day by day.
    Of course, it is not easy to ask for such happy days. During the period of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, the people of the whole country tightened their belts and worked hard; the Soviet farmers worked hard to produce large quantities of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products, and in addition to paying taxes, they also sold the surplus to the state to help the country's industrialization construction. Because the Soviet farmers combined personal interests with national interests, and immediate interests with long-term interests, the result was that "bitterness goes and sweetness comes," industrialization was realized, collective agriculture developed, and the farmers were no longer afraid of poverty, and everyone enjoyed a prosperous and happy life. This is our best example. We must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, form a solid alliance with the working class, resolutely respond to the government's call, sell grain to the state, and help the cause of national construction.

    农民们！踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，帮助国家建设！
    “听共产党的话没错。”这是我国农民在长期的革命斗争和切身生活体验中所获得的最重要的政治经验。在我国第一次和第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争期间，广大农民在共产党的领导下，进行了长期艰苦的斗争，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治，取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。在人民革命中，农民付出的代价是很大的；但是，农民几千年所受的压迫和痛苦根本解除了，农民得到的革命胜利的果实也是巨大的。
    由于伟大的土地改革运动消灭了封建剥削制度，现在除若干少数民族地区以外，约有三万万以上的无地少地的农民分到了七万万亩左右的土地，还分到了许多牲畜、农具、粮食和其他生产资料。在土地改革以前，农民为租种地主的土地而被剥削的地租，如果折合成粮食，每年不下一千亿斤。取消了这个封建剥削，这就给发展农业生产力创造了有利条件，使广大农民的生产积极性大大提高。为了发展生产，人民政府还实行了各种有利于农民的政策，首先是公平合理的负担政策。国家不但规定“增产不增税”，并且规定在“今后三年内，农业税的征收指标，应稳定在一九五二年实际征收的水平上”。这就是说，农业生产虽然逐年发展，国家对于农作物、特别是粮食的需要虽然逐年增加，但在今后几年之内，国家并不增加农民的负担，而采取收购的方法，取得国家所需要的粮食。为了帮助农民发展生产，人民政府历年都发放了大批农业贷款，进行多方面的技术指导，兴修大规模的水利工程。据统计，今年国家发放的农业贷款，包括过去几年积累数字在内，共达十万亿元；国家用于水利建设的经费，共达十二万亿元以上。这些在帮助农民发展农业生产和战胜自然灾害等方面，发挥了重大的作用。人民政府还采取了有利于农民的价格政策。这种政策在几年来实行的结果，完全改变了解放以前谷贱伤农、丰收成灾的现象。同时，国家的商业部门大力开展城乡物资交流，大规模推销农民的土产和特产。这又使农民的收入增加了很多。据调查，土产和特产占农民的总收入约三分之一，并且由于价格提高的结果，农民在这一方面所得的利益比解放以前增加了约二分之一。
    由于我们国家采取了这些正确的政策，由于广大农民生产积极性的高涨，我国的农业生产迅速超过解放前的水平。去年粮食产量相当于一九四九年的百分之一百四十五，棉花产量相当于一九四九年的百分之二百九十一。今年的粮食产量，虽在少数地区受到自然灾害的侵袭，仍不低于去年的水平。
    但是要使农业进一步发展，要使农产物满足国家和人民的不断增长的需要，要使农民的生活真正富裕起来，必须工业大大发达。有了发达的工业，开了很多的矿山工厂，就可以生产大批的新式农具、新式肥料、除虫药械，兴办大批的水利事业，帮助农业的合作化，就可以多修造铁路公路汽车轮船沟通城乡关系，把各种农产品销到城市里去，同时把各种工业品供给农民。总之，工业可以使农村的面目完全发生变化，使劳动的农民享受过去没有过的幸福。中国过去经济落后，工业极不发达，所以一百年来国弱民贫，受尽了帝国主义的欺负。共产党领导革命，打倒帝国主义国民党，多少英雄豪杰流血牺牲，就是为了要把中国建设成为社会主义的工业化的富强国家，为了全国人民永远有好日子过。所以在革命胜利以后，我国的工人阶级、共产党和人民政府，就正在艰苦奋斗，积极发展我国的社会主义工业。要有几个五年计划，才能完成我国工业化的伟大事业。
    工业化的事业不但是工人阶级的事业，而且是全国人民的事业。工业是帮助农民的，但是工业又离不了农民的帮助。第一，工业发达了，矿山和工厂增加了，工人和城市人口就要跟着增加，他们所需要的粮食和蔬菜等副食品也就要跟着增加。第二，工业需要的好些原料是农民生产的，例如纺织业需要的棉花和丝麻，卷菸业需要的菸叶，面粉业榨油业需要的小麦、豆类、花生等。所以农民帮助工业建设的最大责任，就是多生产粮食、棉花和其他农产品。
    但是光生产出来还不算，还必须把农产品卖给合作社和国营粮食公司，这才能卖到真正需要的人手里。如果为了赚钱留着不卖，或者卖给投机的私商让他们拿去捣乱市场，剥削人民，那就是把好事做成了坏事，不但没有帮助建设，反而妨害了建设了。
    在各种农产品里，粮食是最重要的。无论什么人都不能不吃粮食。全国现在差不多有两万万人是要买粮食吃的。这件事情可不简单啊！这就是说，家家余粮户都需要卖出一批余粮来，并且要卖给国家而不卖给私商，才能保证全国人人有饭吃，才能保证全国物价平稳，才能保证全国经济建设顺利进行。因此，农民生产了大批的粮食，又把余粮卖给国家，真是一件大功劳哇！
    把粮食卖给国家，这对国家有好处，对农民自己也有好处。汤阴县大光村刘好仁互助组的组员们，在开会讨论售卖粮食问题的时候，就研究出把粮食卖给国家，对农民共有五种好处：（一）稳定物价。解放前物价一日三变，农民吃了大亏；现在国家掌握了粮食和别的物资，物价稳定，谁也不用害怕了。（二）保证缺粮户的供应。大光村一九五○年闹雹灾，一九五一年闹旱灾，去年又有灾荒，但是因为国家掌握了粮食，保证了供应，谁也没饿着；不然，早就把人饿跑了。（三）把死粮变成活钱，扩大再生产。今年夏天卖给国家两千多斤麦子，修了大车，买了步犁，还添了细肥料，秋季丰产就有保证了。（四）支援工业建设。工业发展，农民就能买到便宜的新式农具，就能生产更多的粮食。比如水车每辆已由一百九十三万元降到一百四十二万元，十吋步犁每具已由四十三万元降到三十三万元。往后工业再发展，还能使上拖拉机。（五）保证国防建设，抗美援朝，让解放军志愿军都吃饱饭。解放军志愿军的战士都是农民，他们的斗争也是为着保家卫国，保卫胜利果实，和农民的利益分不开。由此可见，爱国的农民是懂得把粮食卖给国家的重要意义的，是能够把个人利益和国家利益结合起来，并使个人利益服从国家利益的。近来各地爱国的农民正在把大批粮食卖给国家。浙江桐庐县金东乡毕老五互助组把一万三千斤余粮卖给国家，用卖粮的钱，还了一百五十万元农业贷款，又把六十七万元存入银行，准备明年买肥料，还买了三十多件农具，准备明年生产。全组十四户中，有十三户买了棉布，制作新衣、棉被，以便过冬。这样的例子各地都有，可为其他农民学习的榜样。
    有一些错误的想法应该丢掉。比如，有人说：
  “把粮食卖给私商，看个好价钱不好吗？”他们没有想到这是对国家、对农民都不利的。奸商在市场上往往用高出国家牌价的价格，向农民收买粮食，把粮价哄抬起来，造成市场混乱的现象，他们就从中取利。我们应该认识，奸商是农民生产和生活的破坏者，过去在秋季杀价收购、在春季抬价出售的是他们；现在投机捣乱、破坏国家经济计划的还是他们。爱国的农民决不应该把粮食卖给他们，受他们的剥削。“等一等，看看行市再说”，这也是糊涂的想法。要知道，国家收购粮食，是根据一定的价格政策，既要照顾卖粮的人的利益，又要照顾买粮的人的利益，还要照顾国家建设的长远利益，因此，粮价是不应该随便升降涨落的。而且，粮食储存起来，就会变成死东西，还要遭受虫蚀鼠咬等天然消耗，远不如卖给国家，换来生产资料，来扩大明年的农业生产更为有利。
    爱国的农民们！我们过去跟着共产党走，已经取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利。现在要使我们的国家逐步过渡到社会主义，就必须继续在共产党的领导下，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，实现对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，把我们的祖国建设成像苏联一样的繁荣、富强的国家。只有这样的国家，才能使农民彻底翻身，生活一天比一天好。
    要求得那样幸福的日子，当然不是容易的事情。苏联在社会主义工业化的时期，全国人民节衣缩食，艰苦奋斗；苏联农民努力生产，种出大批粮食、棉花和其他农产品，除了纳税，还把多余的卖给国家，帮助国家的工业化建设。因为苏联农民把个人利益和国家利益，把眼前利益和长远利益结合起来，结果，“苦去甜来”，工业化实现了，集体农业发展了，农民再也不怕穷苦了，人人都得到了富裕、幸福的生活。这是我们最好的榜样。我们一定要在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，和工人阶级结成巩固的联盟，坚决响应政府号召，把粮食卖给国家，帮助国家建设事业。
