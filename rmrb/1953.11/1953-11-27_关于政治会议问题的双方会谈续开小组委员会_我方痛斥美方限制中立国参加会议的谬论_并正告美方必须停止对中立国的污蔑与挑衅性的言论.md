Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 25th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue issued the following communique:

On November 25th, the two subcommittees of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue held their eighth meeting.

In the subcommittee discussing the first agenda item, Mr. Qi Shi-fu, the representative of our side, refuted the fallacy of the other side's attempt to restrict neutral nations from participating in the political conference. He said that since the other side accepts the principle agreed upon by both sides, acknowledging that problems can only be resolved through mutual agreement and not by majority vote, and that neutral nations participate in the political conference to promote mutual agreement, not to undermine it; the other side assumes that after neutral nations participate in the political conference, even agreements already reached by both sides will be undermined. The neutral nations the other side envisions are probably countries like Switzerland, which helps the other side undermine the agreement already reached by both sides regarding the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," to be considered neutral nations. Our side believes that the role of neutral nations lies in promoting agreement between the two sides, so there is no need for a veto power at all; and the other side assumes that neutral nations will have a veto power, is it going to give a veto power to neutral nations like Switzerland, in order to veto the agreements reached by both sides? The other side stipulates many methods to restrict the participation of neutral nations, which is tantamount to refusing neutral nations to participate. If the other side is not prepared to adopt the same arrogant and unreasonable attitude in the political conference as it does in the current talks to entangle and delay, there is no reason to fear the presence of neutral nations to uphold justice.

The US representative made a provocative and lengthy speech, distorting historical facts, denying the Soviet Union as a neutral nation, opposing the participation of Asian neutral nations in the political conference, and distorting and slandering the issue of forced detention of prisoners of war, in order to delay time and obstruct the progress of the bilateral talks.

Mr. Huang Hua, the representative of our side, immediately severely condemned this, emphasizing that the Soviet Union has continuously strived to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the Korean armistice negotiations were convened based on the Soviet Union's proposal. These historical facts cannot be distorted by anyone, and the Soviet Union's neutral status in the Korean War cannot be denied by anyone. The other side deliberately denies it, obviously in order to exclude neutral nations from participating in the political conference. The other side said that Indonesia, Burma, and other new countries are too busy with their own affairs and are therefore not suitable for participating in the political conference, which is a complete insult to these countries and their people. The people of all Asia cannot tolerate this kind of imperialist arrogance and rudeness. As for the other side’s claim that using special agents to forcibly detain prisoners of war is giving prisoners of war the opportunity to choose freely, it is extremely shameless. Because, as everyone knows, the other side directed Li Chiang's special agents to implement brutal terror rule in the prisoner-of-war camps, so that the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war did not dare to apply for repatriation. The other side treats Korean and Chinese prisoners of war with barbaric methods such as torture and slaughter. Is this the opportunity for free choice that the other side is talking about? Finally, Mr. Huang Hua solemnly warned the other side: For the sake of the progress of the talks, the other side must stop such slanderous and provocative remarks in the future.

In the subcommittee discussing the second agenda item, the other side had to admit, after repeated questioning from our side, that a specific date for convening the political conference should be determined. Therefore, in order to prevent the political conference from being indefinitely delayed due to the other side's unreasonable obstruction, our side suggested that the political conference be held in the late December of this year. The other side stated that it would express its opinion on our side's suggestion at the next meeting. Our side agreed to the US request, and the meeting was adjourned for one day on November 26th, and will resume on November 27th.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈续开小组委员会
    我方痛斥美方限制中立国参加会议的谬论
    并正告美方必须停止对中立国的污蔑与挑衅性的言论
    【新华社开城二十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十五日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第八次会议。
    在讨论第一项议程的小组委员会中，我方代表奇石福先生，对于对方企图限制中立国参加政治会议的谬论，加以驳斥。他说，既然对方接受双方一致的原则，承认只能通过双方协议，而不能以多数表决的方法来解决问题，而中立国参加政治会议是为了促成双方协议，不是为了破坏双方的协议；对方却假定中立国参加政治会议后，甚至连双方已经取得的协议都要加以破坏，对方设想的中立国，大概是像瑞士那样帮助对方破坏双方已经协议的关于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的国家，才算是中立国。我方认为中立国的作用既在于推动双方达成协议，因此根本不需要否决权；而对方假定中立国将有否决权，是否要以否决权赋予瑞士这样的中立国，以便否决双方达成的协议？对方规定了许多办法来限制中立国参加，其结果等于拒绝中立国参加。如果对方将来在政治会议中，不准备像在目前会谈中那样采取蛮横无理的态度来纠缠拖延，就没有任何理由害怕中立国在场主持公道。
    美方代表作了挑衅性的冗长发言，歪曲历史事实，否认苏联为中立国，反对亚洲中立国参加政治会议，并就强迫扣留战俘问题，进行了歪曲和污蔑，借以拖延时间，阻挠双方会谈的进展。
    我方代表黄华先生当即痛加斥责，强调指出：苏联曾不断努力促成朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝鲜停战谈判即系根据苏联的建议而召开，这些历史事实决非任何人所能歪曲，而苏联在朝鲜战争中的中立地位亦非任何人所能否认。对方故意加以否认，显然是为了排斥中立国参加政治会议。对方说印尼、缅甸等为新国家自顾不暇，因而不宜参加政治会议，完全是对这些国家及人民的侮辱。全亚洲人民对此种帝国主义的傲慢无礼决不能加以容忍，至于对方把使用特务强迫扣留战俘，说是给战俘的自由选择的机会，更属无耻之尤。因为，尽人皆知，对方指使李蒋特务在战俘营中实行残暴的恐怖统治，才使朝中战俘不敢申请遣返。对方用苦刑、屠杀等野蛮方法对待朝中战俘，难道这就是对方所说的给予他们以自由选择的机会？最后黄华先生正告对方：为了会谈的进展，对方今后必须停止此种污蔑与挑衅性的言论。
    在讨论第二项议程的小组委员会中，对方在我方一再追问之下，不得不承认应当确定一个召开政治会议的具体日期。因此，为使政治会议不致因对方的无理阻挠而被无限期地拖延下去，我方建议政治会议在今年十二月下旬举行。对方称将在下次会上对我方这一建议发表意见。我方同意美方要求，十一月二十六日休会一日，二十七日再行复会。
