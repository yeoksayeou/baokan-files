Farmers across the country continue to display enthusiasm for increasing production and saving grain. After the autumn harvest and planting, or simultaneously with the harvest of late autumn crops, they have launched winter production activities to lay the foundation for increased production next year.

In the northern provinces, the autumn harvest and planting work has basically concluded. In order to strive for increased grain production next year, farmers in various regions are carrying out winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction. In Hebei Province, after completing wheat planting, some farmers are still checking and replanting seedlings. Others have fully shifted to plowing the land. The Tongxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province discovered that some county and district cadres were not seizing winter plowing after planting wheat. Some people were eager to use livestock for transportation and other sideline occupations, instead of seizing the opportunity to plow the land. Therefore, they instructed counties to strengthen leadership over winter plowing work, publicize the benefits of winter plowing to the masses, and persuade farmers near cities and factories and mines who are engaged in both agriculture and industry or both agriculture and commerce to plow the land first before going to work or doing business, so as not to affect grain production next year. Tongxian and Baoding prefectures, in conjunction with land cultivation, promoted new-style walking plows. Cadres first learned the usage techniques and then taught them to the masses. According to incomplete statistics from Mancheng, Qingyuan, and other four counties in Baoding Prefecture, after the transmission of technology, 172 walking plows that had been purchased but not used in the past were put into use, and 137 new walking plows were promoted. The Shandong Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has deployed current agricultural production tasks, emphasizing doing a good job in winter production work: seed selection, winter plowing and deep plowing, and soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, construction of farmland water conservancy, and pest control. It also requested that this winter, through appraisals, the winter production mobilization work be done well, and the mutual aid and cooperation organizations be consolidated. The Shandong Dazhong Daily also published an editorial entitled "The Plan for Increased Production Next Year Lies in This Winter," calling on various regions to carry out winter production. Many counties, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid groups in Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan provinces have formulated winter production plans and are carrying out agricultural capital construction. The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has completed land cultivation work. This year, the Li Shunda Cooperative meticulously plowed the land, even in areas that could not be reached by the plow, a new feature of this year's intensive cultivation. In the past, although the entire area was plowed once, in fact, each field left two headlands unplowed. The entire cooperative had 40 mu of land that had not been plowed, which affected the improvement of production. Now the cooperative has turned to building water ponds and other projects. Members of the Xiao Jinren Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, decided to invest most of the income from sideline production in agricultural capital construction. They contracted 20 toilets in the city and renovated pigsties and cattle pens, planning to accumulate enough 500 large carts of fertilizer this winter. The Feng Yuzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongtong County plans to accumulate 860,000 jin of fertilizer from this winter to March next year. In the Sixth District of Mengyin County, Shandong Province, many farmers improved their soil last year, and their grain output this year was more than double that of previous years. After summarizing this experience, the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party widely promoted it, mobilizing the masses to dredge ditches and drain water in low-lying areas, replace soil and suppress sand, and stack soil in sandy ridges and thin land to prevent drought and flood. After summarizing the experience of increasing production, the members of the Yu Songchang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fourth District of Wendeng also invested in land cultivation, sand suppression, soil improvement, and fertilizer accumulation. Pingshun and Lingchuan counties in Shanxi Province have both launched work to reserve winter grass for livestock.

Farmers in many areas of the southern provinces have also begun winter production. Xiangnan Prefecture in Hunan Province plans to expand the winter planting area by 19% on the basis of last year. Farmers in various parts of Hunan are also actively carrying out fertilizer accumulation and farmland water conservancy construction. Liling County vigorously promoted the method of planting green manure with grass seeds, and in the Tenth District of Hanshou County, more than 300 small boats were fishing for silk grass by the lake every day, accumulating it for fertilizer. More than 600 farmers in Dihua Township, Yuanjiang County, were shoveling grass to accumulate fertilizer every day, and farmers in ten townships of Liuyang County were repairing ponds and dams. Guangxi and Guangdong are both vigorously preparing for winter plowing and winter planting. The People's Government of Guangxi Province issued a "Proclamation on Launching the Winter Production Movement," requiring various regions to expand the winter planting area by 20% to 50% based on the farmers' original winter planting habits and planting foundation. The People's Government of Guangdong Province also issued "Instructions on Winter Plowing Production," requiring various regions to strive to do a good job in winter plowing. It also advocated plowing and planting at the same time, planting more sweet potatoes, wheat, beans, and other crops to increase grain harvest. Many farmers in Jiangxi Province have changed the habit of "winter rest" in the past and actively expanded the winter planting area. Farmers plan to winter plow and plant an area accounting for more than 55% of the province's total cultivated area, and winter planting work is proceeding rapidly. Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, plans to eliminate 50,000 mu of winter fallow land this year to plant spring flowers, use winter fallow early rice seedling fields to grow vegetables, and increase intercropping area by 100,000 mu throughout the county to grow vegetables, which can increase income equivalent to more than 30 million jin of rice. The Department of Agriculture of the People's Government of Fujian Province held a meeting to deploy autumn and winter production work, emphasizing expanding the winter planting area and doing a good job in fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, and other work. This year, the winter planting area in Minhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, will be expanded by 150,000 mu compared with last year, reaching the requirement of planting 685,500 mu of wheat, green manure, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, vegetables, and other crops. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the People's Government of Anhui Province proposed that the current agricultural production, in addition to doing a good job in planting wheat and protecting late autumn crops, should also mobilize the masses to organize and do a good job in winter farmland water conservancy construction. It also required various regions to summarize and study methods of ensuring harvest and increasing production, and strive for increased production next year.

    各地农民开始冬季生产
    冬耕积肥兴修水利为明年增产打下基础
    各地农民继续发挥增产节约粮食的积极性，在秋收秋种以后或和收割晚秋同时，展开了冬季生产的活动，为明年增产打基础。
    北部各省秋收秋种工作已基本结束。各地农民为了争取明年粮食的增产，都在进行冬耕、积肥、兴修水利的工作。河北省各地在种完小麦后，除还有一部分农民在查苗补苗以外，其他已全力转入耕地。河北通县地委发现部分县区干部在种麦以后，不抓紧冬耕，部分群众有急于把畜力用去搞运输和其他副业，而不抓紧耕地现象，就指示各县加强对冬耕工作的领导，向群众宣传冬耕的好处，说服离城市及厂矿近的半农半工或半农半商的农民，先耕地后去做工或经商，以免影响明年粮食增产。通县、保定等专区并结合耕地，推广了新式步犁，干部先学会使用技术，然后教给群众。据保定专区满城、清苑等四县不完全统计，经过传授技术，就有一百七十二张过去已买而未用的步犁使用起来，并新推广了一百三十七张步犁。中共中央山东分局已布置了当前农业生产任务，强调做好冬季生产工作：选种、冬耕深刨和改良土壤、积肥、兴修农田水利、除虫。并要求今冬通过评比，做好冬季生产动员工作，整理巩固互助合作组织。山东大众日报并以“明年增产之计在于今冬”为题的社论，号召各地开展冬季生产。山西、山东、河南省许多县和农业生产合作社、互助组都已订出冬季生产的计划，进行农业基本建设。山西平顺县李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，已经完成耕地工作。李顺达社今年把地头上耕不到的地方都用钁细刨过，这是该社今年精耕细作中的新特点，因为往年虽说普耕一遍，事实上每块地都留了两个地头，全社合起来有四十亩地是没有耕过的，这就影响了生产的提高。现在该社已转入修水池等的工作。山西朔县萧进仁农业生产合作社社员决定把副业生产所得的大部投入农业基本建设。他们在城里包了二十个厕所，并倒修猪圈和牛圈，计划要在今冬积够五百大车的肥料。洪洞县冯玉璋农业生产合作社计划今冬到明年三月要积够八十六万斤肥料。山东蒙阴县第六区，有许多农民去年因整地改良土壤，今年比往年增产了两倍多的粮食。该区中共区委总结这一经验后，广泛推广，发动群众在涝洼地拨沟排涝，换土压沙，在沙岭薄地叠土，以防旱防涝。文登四区于松长农业生产合作社的社员也在总结增产经验后，投入耕地、压沙、改良土壤和积肥等工作。山西平顺、陵川两县并且都已展开给牲畜储备冬草的工作。
    南部各省许多地区的农民也都开始进行冬季生产。湖南省湘南专区计划在去年基础上扩大冬种面积百分之十九。湖南各地农民并积极进行积肥和兴修农田水利。醴陵县大力推广了用草子种绿肥的办法，汉寿县第十区每天有三百多只划子在湖边打捞丝草，积起来作肥料，沅江县大华乡每天六百多农民铲草积肥，浏阳县有十个乡的农民在整修塘坝。广西、广东都在大力准备冬耕冬种。广西省人民政府发出“关于开展冬季生产运动的布告”，要求各地根据农民原有冬种习惯和种植基础，扩大冬种面积二成至五成。广东省人民政府也发出“关于冬耕生产的指示”，要求各地努力做好冬耕工作。并提倡一边冬耕，一边下种，多种薯类、小麦、豆类等作物，以增加粮食收获量。江西省许多农民都改变了过去“歇冬”的习惯，积极扩大冬种面积。农民计划冬耕冬种的面积，占全省总耕地面积的百分之五十五以上，现在冬种工作正在迅速进行。浙江省萧山县今年计划消灭冬闲地五万亩种春花，利用冬闲早稻秧田种菜，并在全县增加间作面积十万亩种菜，共计可增加的收入折合稻谷三千多万斤。福建省人民政府农业厅开会布置了秋冬生产工作。强调扩大冬种面积，并做好积肥、水利等工作。福建闽侯专区，今年冬种面积要比去年扩大十五万亩，达到种植大小麦、绿肥、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、蔬菜等作物六十八万五千五百亩的要求。安徽省人民政府农林厅提出当前农业生产，除做好种麦，保护晚秋作物外，还要发动群众组织起来，做好冬季兴修农田水利等工作。并要求各地总结研究保收、增产的办法，争取明年增产。
