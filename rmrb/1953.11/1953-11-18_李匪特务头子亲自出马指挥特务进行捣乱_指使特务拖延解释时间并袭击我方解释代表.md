Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: During the explanation process on the 16th, Moon Joong-ho, the head of the Lee Seung-man special agent organization "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," directed special agents to select "reliable elements" to listen to the explanation, ordered them to delay the time, and personally directed the special agents to carry out sabotage and destruction at the explanation site. In this way, most of the prisoners of war were deprived of the opportunity to listen to the explanation.

Li Wenxie, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army who returned yesterday, said: At six o'clock yesterday morning, the special agent leader Moon Joong-ho and three other special agents arrived at Camp No. 53. Moon Joong-ho intimidated the prisoners of war, saying: You will only have a future if you beat and insult the explanation representatives. When the prisoners of war left the camp, Moon Joong-ho and three other special agents stood at the barbed wire entrance and threatened them one by one.

When the prisoners of war arrived at the waiting tent, Moon Joong-ho was already there. Li Wenxie saw that Moon Joong-ho and "Battalion Commander" Wu Ri-cheng discussed for a long time. Then, Wu Ri-cheng picked out some "reliable elements" and took them to listen to the explanation first. Li Wenxie said: "Our camp was originally divided into 20 groups, 25 people in each group. But after the special agents let the 'reliable elements' of the first group listen to the explanation, they took the 'reliable elements' of the second group to listen, and did not let the prisoners of war that the special agents considered 'unreliable' listen to the explanation." Li Wenxie said that the special agents also ordered those "reliable elements" to pretend to listen to the explanation, delay the time, and attack our explanation representatives, so that we did not have the time and conditions to explain to all the prisoners of war.

Li Wenxie also revealed that in order to strengthen control over the prisoners of war in Camp No. 53, the U.S. side specially transferred experienced special agents from other camps to this camp. Wu Ri-cheng, the current "Battalion Commander" of Camp No. 53, was transferred from another camp not long ago. As soon as Wu Ri-cheng arrived, he forced the prisoners of war to conduct "exercises" to disrupt the explanation work. During yesterday's explanation process, the methods used by the special agents to make noise and pretend to be repatriated to attack the explanation representatives were all arranged by Wu Ri-cheng. He openly coerced the prisoners of war, saying: "I already know that the explanation representative is sitting on the left. You must find an opportunity to beat and insult the representative as soon as you enter the door!"

Shen Zaijing, who returned at the same time as Li Wenxie, confirmed that even now, the U.S. garbage truck drivers are still continuing to transmit secret instructions to special agents inside and outside the camp. Shen Zaijing personally saw a garbage truck driver provided by the U.S. side hand over a document to Wu Ri-cheng on the 10th. He also heard Wu Ri-cheng openly say to the prisoners of war: "Don't think that the camp is now under the supervision of neutral nations. We can still contact freely every day, just like we were in the Republic of Korea!"

### 李匪特务头子亲自出马指挥特务进行捣乱  指使特务拖延解释时间并袭击我方解释代表

    李匪特务头子亲自出马指挥特务进行捣乱
    指使特务拖延解释时间并袭击我方解释代表
    【新华社开城十七日电】在十六日解释过程中，李承晚特务组织“反共青年团”头子文重浩，指挥特务分子挑选“可靠分子”去听解释，命令他们拖延时间并亲自在解释场所指挥特务进行捣乱破坏。这样，大部分战俘听解释的机会被剥夺了。
    昨天归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李文协说：昨天早晨六点钟，特务头子文重浩便和另外三个特务分子到了第五十三号营场。文重浩恫吓战俘说：你们只有殴打和侮辱解释代表才有前途。战俘走出营场时，文重浩还和另外三个特务站在铁丝网口，一个个地对他们进行威胁。
    战俘到等待帐篷时，文重浩也已经在那里了。李文协看见，文重浩和“大队长”吴日成在一起商量了半天，接着，吴日成就把一部分“可靠分子”挑出来，先带去听解释。李文协说：“我们营场本来被分成二十个小组，二十五人为一组。但特务们让第一个小组的‘可靠分子’去听解释以后，便把第二组的‘可靠分子’接上去，而不让特务们认为‘不可靠’的战俘去听解释。”李文协说，特务们同时命令那些“可靠分子”，假装听解释拖延时间和袭击我方解释代表，使我方没有时间和条件向全部战俘进行解释。
    李文协并揭露：美方为了加强控制第五十三号营场的战俘，特地从其他营场抽调有经验的特务到这个营场。现任第五十三号营场“大队长”的吴日成，便是不久前从别的营场抽调来的。吴日成一来，就强迫战俘进行破坏解释工作的“演习”。昨天解释过程中，特务们使用的吵闹和假装遣返来袭击解释代表的方法，都是吴日成布置的。他曾公开胁迫战俘说：“我已经知道解释代表坐在左边，你们要一进门就找机会殴打和侮辱代表！”
    与李文协同时归来的申在京证实说：直到现在，美方的垃圾车司机还在继续为营场内外的特务传递秘密指令。申在京在十日曾亲眼看见一个美方提供的垃圾车司机把一份文件交给吴日成。他并听到吴日成公开对战俘说：“别看现在是在中立国看管营场，我们还是和在大韩民国时一样，每天都可以自由联系！”
