Improving Construction Management is a Guarantee of Increased Production and Economy

Heavy Industry Department Directly Subordinate Construction Engineering Company Beijing Institute of Steel and Iron Construction Site Wang Shuyiao

Since September, under the direct leadership of the Central Heavy Industry Department, we have launched a patriotic movement for increasing production and practicing economy. The People's Daily and the Central Heavy Industry Department have repeatedly pointed out that increasing production and practicing economy in capital construction must focus on implementing the responsibility system, ensuring project quality, and guaranteeing timely completion in order to achieve comprehensive completion of the national plan in a good, fast, and economical manner. We have repeatedly studied these instructions and believe they are entirely correct.

Last year, we also carried out a movement to increase production and practice economy, and we overfulfilled the national plan. However, there were serious shortcomings. The most prominent were: 1. “Increasing production” by means of shock tactics, resulting in poor quality and bringing about a large amount of rework waste. This year, rework costs alone amounted to 1.6 billion yuan. 2. Savings could not be accounted for, and waste was not prevented. Due to the lack of a set of scientific enterprise management systems, although employees worked hard to achieve some savings during construction, accounts could not be calculated until completion, and ultimately the savings were "lost in the pot."

Learning from past lessons, in this year's production increase and economy drive at the Iron and Steel Institute construction site, we focused on "implementing the responsibility system and improving enterprise management."

Starting with Continuing to Deepen the Implementation of the Responsibility System

Since May of this year, we have launched a movement to establish a responsibility system. However, the real establishment and implementation of the responsibility system is not an easy task. As recently as early September, a serious rework incident occurred in the main building project: due to a miscalculation of the reinforced concrete mix ratio by specialist technician Jin Tianyi, 7.66 cubic meters of work had to be redone; previously, due to a "line" being laid incorrectly by construction worker Ge Yunqing, which was not detected at the time, more than 5,000 brick walls at the main building entrance also had to be redone. These two facts illustrate that the implementation of the responsibility system is a long-term and arduous struggle. Accepting this lesson, the company's Party committee called on us to conduct a mass inspection of the implementation of the responsibility system. The results of the inspection revealed more than 370 cases of unaccountability and irresponsibility at construction sites one and two alone. After this inspection, everyone's understanding of the responsibility system improved further, and various measures were taken to further reverse the phenomenon of unaccountability.

In late September, we also implemented the grassroots administrative responsibility system in key projects. In the past, our construction sites had overlapping layers, and problems were solved slowly. The construction site director assigned work downward, and it was passed down layer by layer, with less and less being conveyed each time, often disappearing by the time it reached the workers. Workers were in a state of constant flux. Although the construction worker was responsible for technical guidance, he had a contractual relationship with the workers. However, no one was responsible for the administrative leadership of the workers. As a result, individual workers would not listen to the construction worker's instructions, and the construction worker was helpless. Labor discipline was very lax. The construction worker was very distressed, and the workers felt that they were being moved around and felt insecure.

After careful study of the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, combined with the specific circumstances, the company leadership formulated measures to abolish the construction worker system and implement a foreman system instead. Trial implementation in the main building project has shown significant results. Now, the number of layers has been reduced. Below the construction site director is the foreman, who directly leads several groups. Moreover, authority and responsibility are clearly defined, and problems are no longer dealt with in a roundabout way. The former construction workers who were selected to be the current foremen are equipped with fixed groups to lead, and their relationship with the workers is also harmonious. Problems are solved in a timely manner, and the foremen's prestige has also increased. In the past, construction workers rarely got involved in promoting advanced experiences, but now foremen are personally involved in providing guidance and demonstrations. What is particularly important is that although the construction site director responsibility system had been established in the past, it was difficult to find responsibility below the construction site director. Now, the foreman is fully responsible for everything from progress, quality, security, savings, and even labor discipline for the group under his charge. This solves the problem of unifying grassroots administrative leadership and technical leadership. In the past, if a task was not completed, the construction worker would say to the construction site director: "Who told you to give me such a small group?" Now, however, the foremen feel that they are obliged to fulfill their responsibilities and, on the contrary, feel that it is easier to do their work. With these guarantees of the responsibility system, increasing production and practicing economy has a solid foundation.

Guaranteeing Project Quality is the Biggest Saving

"Quality first" can be heard everywhere verbally, but when it comes to specific issues, it is often still "progress first." This tendency is particularly likely to arise in the movement to increase production and practice economy. Correcting this error requires, first of all, the greatest determination on the part of the leadership. The Iron and Steel Institute has a 48-meter-high chimney. According to the old rules, the body of the chimney could only be built one section per day. However, during the September competition, the workers proposed to complete the body of the chimney in 17 days, building two and a half sections per day, or even three sections. In this way, the project progress was too fast, and the demolding period was too short, making it difficult to guarantee quality. After studying the situation, the chief engineer ordered a one-day work stoppage in the middle and prohibited more than two and a half sections per day, ensuring the quality of the chimney. Therefore, only by conducting an irreconcilable struggle against poor quality can quality be guaranteed while accelerating construction.

At present, most projects are entering the final stage, and decoration projects have become the main focus. In the past, we often had problems with decoration projects. Decoration projects account for the vast majority of rework this year. Guaranteeing the quality of decoration is, in essence, a huge saving. Therefore, we have proposed to put ensuring the quality of decoration projects in the first place. On the one hand, we are conducting extensive education, and on the other hand, we are focusing on promoting advanced operating methods and advanced tools that guarantee the quality of decoration projects. Currently, eight new tools that both guarantee quality and improve efficiency are being widely used, and as a result, project quality has clearly improved.

In order to learn from past lessons, we have recently systematically analyzed many rework incidents. Many errors were made before construction even began. Therefore, prior inspection is essential. We have formulated more than 30 inspection items and procedures that must be followed for this type of preventative inspection. We call this system the "pre-inspection system" and it is now being piloted in the main building key project.

Accelerating Construction by Implementing Work Plans

It is now the fourth quarter, and accelerating project construction is of particular importance. This is because early completion will allow the state to use the projects sooner, and it will also free up construction departments to do more projects for the state. Our woodworking factory has improved production efficiency by implementing work plans in production. In addition to fully completing the processing tasks for the Iron and Steel Institute construction site, it has also taken on 8,800 sets of doors and windows for the Geological Institute and the company's Tongxian construction site, which will increase revenue by 230 million yuan. The weather is getting colder day by day. If many projects are dragged into winter construction, construction costs will inevitably increase due to fuel costs, equipment costs, etc. Without appropriate measures or equipment, project quality will inevitably be affected, and workers' work efficiency will also decrease. Therefore, striving to complete the main parts and the vast majority of the projects before freezing is actually a great saving.

However, mentioning "accelerating construction" easily leads to the phenomenon of using more people, horses, and overtime to rush work. This kind of thinking and practice must be firmly opposed, and necessary measures must be taken to prevent it, otherwise it will inevitably lead to disaster. The negative consequences of working overtime will cause production to become unbalanced, increase worker fatigue, and are the main cause of personal accidents and poor quality. Accelerating construction can only be achieved by strengthening planning management.

The shortcomings that existed in our work plans in the past few months were that the company's plans were divided into monthly and daily plans, and the construction sites had bi-weekly and daily plans. The time period was too long, and they could not be adjusted and revised according to the specific circumstances. There were no balancing meetings or other systems. Later, after learning from the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel, we changed the company's plans to monthly and weekly plans, and the construction sites' plans to weekly and daily plans. The planning cycle was shortened, making it easier to adjust and control. The supply of materials, labor, equipment, and tools was all changed to monthly plans, so that they were in step with the project progress plans. It was also stipulated that balancing meetings must be held before drafting the plans to check the construction conditions. If the conditions were not met, they would not be included in the plans, in order to strengthen the practicality of the plans. The implementation of plans, especially the main project plans, was strengthened through dispatching, supervision, and inspection. As a result of these measures, coupled with the face-to-face competition between worker groups based on work plans, the monthly plan targets were overfulfilled in September, ensuring that more than 63% of the annual tasks were completed in the third quarter.

In order to make the plans more accurate and to create the preconditions for the timely supply of materials, we also organized a crash effort to compile the construction budget. By early September, the construction budgets for most of the projects had been submitted, and the compilation methods had been improved, thereby ensuring their accuracy. When compiling the instruction charts and work plans for decoration projects, based on climatic factors, we also put forward principles such as "exterior first, then interior," "difficult first, then easy," and "shady side first, then sunny side." Promoting advanced experiences with decisive significance is one of the fundamental measures for accelerating construction. Therefore, plans for accelerating construction must take this positive factor into account.

Reasonably Saving Materials and Thoroughly Doing Recycling Work

Completing the plans for increasing production and practicing economy by implementing the responsibility system, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing timely completion does not mean that one can ignore savings. In fact, wasteful phenomena are very common in construction. In saving raw materials and labor, it is particularly important to emphasize rationality. Saving materials in a way that affects quality will lead to huge losses. For example, if it is stipulated that the ceiling should be plastered three times, but some groups only plastered it twice, it will have to be redone. This is called "cutting corners," and it has nothing in common with saving. Our savings must be accomplished by minimizing the consumption rate of raw materials under the principle of ensuring that construction is carried out according to the drawings and operating procedures. To this end, conscientiously implementing the group economic accounting manual, especially the quota-based material requisition handbooks, is the main measure for saving.

The waste of labor must be stopped. For example, the unrestricted use of hourly workers on some construction sites has caused wage overruns. In particular, now that most structural projects have been completed, failing to properly arrange for skilled workers will result in wasted work hours.

Many projects are now entering the final stage or have been completed. Doing a good job in material recycling is a very important saving. Last year, after the completion of some of our construction sites, no one was responsible for the recycling and storage of wood, and a lot of it was stolen and burned; 30,000 to 40,000 red bricks from the College of Engineering were buried in the ground and have already been excavated; more than 1,000 grass bags were removed from the ceilings of the Heavy Industry Department dormitory. This shows that the completion and recycling work is a very important task. In order to do this work well, we have organized a recycling team, led by the finance department, to supervise and inspect the relevant units to carry out the cleaning and recycling of raw materials, equipment, and tools at each construction site, formulated various recycling methods, designated the storage locations for large materials such as wood, scaffolding poles, and scaffolding boards, arranged for equipment maintenance tasks, and strengthened fire prevention and security work.

Doing a Good Job in Preparing for Next Year

Increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental policy of socialist enterprise management, not a temporary crash task. Therefore, on the basis of this year, running winter training well, conscientiously summarizing experience and lessons learned, and putting forward management plans for the coming year is also an important task.

In winter training, we must improve and consolidate workers' skills. Many reworks and waste this year were caused by the workers' low technical level. In addition, organizing workers to learn a second occupation on the basis of improving their existing technical skills is also a new task. This will reduce the "inevitable" waste of work hours caused by the sequence of construction procedures each year, and it will also ensure that most workers are fixed at the same construction site, creating favorable preconditions for consolidating the "foreman system."

In terms of summarizing experience, we have organized a force to summarize the gains and losses of this year's work according to various business natures, further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and put forward plans for next year. We believe that only by further improving enterprise management can we achieve greater increases in production and economy in future tasks.

    改进施工管理是增产节约的保证
    重工业部直属建设工程公司  北京钢铁学院工地  王述尧
    九月以来，我们在中央重工业部的直接领导下开展了爱国主义的增产节约运动，人民日报与中央重工业部一再指出在基本建设中进行增产节约必须以推行责任制，保证工程质量，保证按期竣工为中心，才能做到又好又快又省地全面完成国家计划，我们曾反复学习这些指示，认为是完全正确的。
    去年我们也曾进行过增产节约运动，超额完成了国家计划，但其中却存在着严重的缺点。特别突出的就是：一、以突击方法来“增产”，造成质量低劣，带来大量的返工浪费。今年只返修费一项就花了十六亿元之多。二、节约也算不出账来，浪费并未杜绝。由于缺乏一套科学的企业管理制度，虽然职工们辛辛苦苦地在施工中作到了一些节约，但直到竣工也算不出账来，最后还是“肉烂在锅里”。
    吸取过去的教训，今年在钢铁学院工地的增产节约中，我们就抓住了“推行责任制，改善企业管理”这个环节来进行。
    从继续深入推行责任制入手
    今年五月以来，我们就开展了建立责任制运动。但责任制的真正建立与贯彻并不是轻而易举的事，至九月上旬主楼工程就发生了一件性质严重的返工事故：由于专责技术员金天一将钢筋混凝土配合比计算错了，造成七点六六立方公尺工程的返工；前此，由于施工员葛云卿将“线”放错了，当时没有检查出来，也造成了主楼大门口五千多块砖墙的返工。这两件事实说明了责任制的贯彻是一个长期的艰巨的斗争。接受了这次教训，公司党委遂号召我们开展一次群众性的责任制贯彻情况的大检查，检查结果仅一、二工地就揭发出三百七十多件无人负责和不负责任的现象。经过这次检查，大家对责任制的认识又提高一步，并采取了各种措施进一步扭转了无人负责现象。
    九月下旬，我们又在重点工程上推行了基层行政责任制，过去我们工地层次重叠，解决问题迟缓，工地主任向下布置工作，一层一层往下传，越传越少，传到工人时往往就传没有了。工人则处于经常流动状态，施工员虽负技术指导之责，但与工人是合同关系，对工人的行政领导却是无人负责，因而个别工人不听施工员的指挥施工员也无可如何。劳动纪律很松弛，施工员很苦恼，工人也感到调来调去，弄得无依无靠。
    公司领导上对重工业部的指示认真研究之后，结合具体情况拟定了废除施工员制，改行工长制的措施。经过在主楼工程试行已见显著功效。现在层次减少了，工地主任之下就是工长，工长直接领导几个小组，而且职权分明，解决问题也就不再兜圈子了。选拔过去的施工员当了现在的工长，配备了固定的小组由他领导，他们和工人的关系也融洽了，解决问题及时，工长们的威信也提高了。过去推广先进经验很少有施工员过问，而现在工长们都亲自动手进行指导示范。特别重要的是过去工地主任负责制虽已建立，而工地主任之下却很难找出负责制来，现在一切进度、质量、保安、节省甚至劳动纪律，工长对其所管小组都要负完全责任，这样才解决了基层的行政领导与技术领导统一的问题，过去完不成任务，施工员对工地主任说：“谁让你给我这样的小组来？”而现在工长们却已责无旁贷，相反地却感到好干了。有了这些责任制的保证，增产节约才有了坚实的基础。
    保证工程质量是最大的节约
   “质量第一”在口头上到处可听到，但一碰上具体问题，则往往还是“进度第一”。特别在增产节约运动中更容易产生这种偏向。纠正这种错误首先需要领导上最大的决心。钢铁学院有一座四十八公尺高的大烟囱，按老规矩筒身一天只能打一节，但在九月竞赛当中，工人们提出以十七天的速度来完成筒身部分，一天打两节半，甚至打到三节。这样，工程进度过快，拆模期太短，不容易保证质量；主任工程师研究了这种情况就下令中途停工一天，并每日不准超过两节半，保证了大烟筒的质量。所以只有与质量低劣现象进行不调和的斗争，才能在加速施工的情况下保证质量。
    目前大部工程进入收尾阶段，装修工程已占了主要地位。过去我们在装修工程上常常发生毛病，今年返修工程中装修工程占绝大部分，保证装修的质量，实质上就是一笔巨大的节约。因此我们提出把保证装修工程质量放在首要地位，一方面进行广泛的教育，一方面则抓住了推广保证装修工程质量的先进操作方法与先进工具这一环节。现在有八种既保证质量又能提高效率的新工具被广泛地采用着，因而工程质量显见提高。
    为了接受过去的教训，最近我们系统地分析了许多返工事故，有许多错误是在施工前就铸成了的，因而预先检查是十分必要的。对于这类防祸患于未然的检查我们已订出三十余项必须履行的检查项目与手续，这一制度我们称之为“预检制”，现在已在主楼重点试行。
    以贯彻作业计划来加速施工
    现在已是第四季度，加速工程施工有特殊重要的意义，因为，提早完工可使国家早日使用，对于施工部门也可以腾出手来为国家多作一些工程。我们的木工厂由于在生产中贯彻了作业计划，提高了生产效率，现在除了全面完成钢铁学院工地加工任务之外，又接收了地质学院与本公司通县工地的门窗口扇八千八百多件，将可增加收入两亿三千万元。现在天气日冷，如果将许多工程拖入冬季施工，在施工费用上势必增加燃料费设备费等，若无适当措施或设备，工程质量必受到影响，工人工作效率也降低，因而争取在结冻前完成主要部分和绝大部分的工程，实际上就是很大的节约。
    但是提起“加速施工”，则容易产生加人加马加班加点来突击的现象，对于这种思想与作法必须坚决反对，并采取必要的措施加以制止，否则必将带来灾害。加班加点的恶果会使生产陷于不均衡，增加工人的疲劳，而且是产生人身事故和质量低劣的主要根源。加速施工只有从加强计划管理入手。
    我们过去几个月作业计划中存在的缺点，在于公司计划是按月分日，工地是双周分日计划，时间过长，不能根据具体情况调整修正，并无平衡会议等制度。后来学习了鞍钢的经验，改为公司作按月逐周计划，工地改为逐周分日计划，计划周期缩短了，便于调整掌握，材料、劳动力、设备、工具的供应都改为按月计划，使之与工程进度计划步调一致，并规定了编制之前一定要开好平衡会议，检查施工条件，没有条件者不列入计划，以加强计划的现实性。并通过调度加强督促检查，以保证计划特别是主要工程计划的实现。由于采取了这一措施，加上以作业计划为基础的工人小组之间面对面的竞赛，结果于九月份超额完成了月计划指标，保证了第三季度完成全年任务的百分之六十三以上。
    为了把计划编制得更准确，并为及时供应材料创造前提，我们又组织力量突击了施工预算的编制工作，于九月上旬大部工程的施工预算都已提出，并改进了编制方法，从而保证了它的正确性。在编制装修工程的指示图表与作业计划时，根据气候因素我们又提出了“先外后内”，“先难后简”，
  “先阴面，后阳面”等原则。推广有决定意义的先进经验是加速施工的根本措施之一。因而加速施工的计划必须考虑这一积极因素。
    合理节约工料，彻底作好回收工作
    以推行责任制、保证质量、保证按期竣工来完成增产节约计划，并不是说可以不管节约了。实际上施工中浪费现象是很普遍的。在节省原材料与劳动力中值得特别强调的是要合理，“节省”了材料而影响了质量的节约方法就会带来巨大的损失。如本来规定天棚抹三遍灰，而有的小组竟抹了两遍，势需返工，这叫“偷工减料”，与节约毫无共同之点。我们的节约必须在保证按图施工，按操作规程施工的原则下尽量节省原材料的耗损率来完成，为此认真贯彻小组经济核算手册，特别是其中的限额领料手折就是节约的主要措施。
    劳动力的浪费现象必须杜绝。如有的工地计时工使用上的无限制，已造成工资超支，特别是目前大部结构工程完成，对技术工人如不适当安插就会造成窝工浪费。
    现在许多工程已进入收尾阶段或已竣工，作好材料回收工作是一项十分重要的节约。去年我们有的工地工程完了，木材回收保管无人负责，曾被人偷去烧掉很多；工学院红砖埋在土中，已发掘出的就有三、四万块，重工业部宿舍曾在天棚上取下一千多个草袋子。由此可见竣工回收工作是一项非常重要的任务。为了作好这一工作，我们已组织了回收组，由财务科领导有关单位督促检查各工地进行原材料、设备工具的清理回收工作，制订了各项回收办法，指定了木材、脚手杆、跳板等大宗材料的包管地点，布置了设备检修的任务，并加强了防火保卫工作。
    作好明年准备工作
    增产节约是社会主义企业经营管理的根本方针，不是一时的突击任务。因而在今年的基础上办好冬训，认真总结经验教训，提出来年的管理方案也是一项重要任务。
    在冬训中，我们必须作到提高并巩固工人的技术。今年有许多返工浪费是由于工人技术水平不高造成的，另外在提高原有本行技术水平的基础上组织工人学习第二职业也是一项新的任务。这样就可以减少每年由于施工程序先后所造成的“不可避免”的窝工损失，并可保证固定大部工人于同一工地，为巩固“工长制”创造有利前提。
    在总结经验方面，我们已组织了一部力量根据各种业务性质，总结今年工作上的得失，进一步学习苏联先进经验，提出明年的方案。我们相信，只有进一步提高企业管理才能在今后的任务中，作到更大的增产节约。
