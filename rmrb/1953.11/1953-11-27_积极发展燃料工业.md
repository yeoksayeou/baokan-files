    Actively Develop the Fuel Industry
    The fuel industry (including coal, electricity, and petroleum) is an important component of the national economy. To build a strong, modernized industry and a modernized national defense, we must build a fuel industry that is commensurate with this, ensuring a sufficient supply of electricity, coal, and petroleum. Therefore, actively developing the fuel industry is an important task in our country's industrialization construction. The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has made a comprehensive plan for the future development of the fuel industry based on the national construction plan, which is very necessary.
    In the past few years, with the efforts of all employees in the fuel industry and the enthusiastic and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, we have vigorously carried out the restoration, transformation, and key construction of the fuel industry, supplying the fuel and electricity needed during the national economic recovery period, basically ensuring the progress of the national economic recovery work, and ensuring the fuel needs of the vast number of people in their daily lives. This year, the state's investment in the construction of the fuel industry is 2.4 times that of last year, approaching the total state investment in the past three years. These investment projects include seventy coal, electricity, and petroleum construction projects, one hundred and twenty coalfield and sixty-one petroleum resource exploration works, as well as hydrological measurements and geological drilling of the Yellow River, Han River, Xin'an River, and other rivers for the future construction of hydropower stations. After the completion of these construction projects, the output of our country's fuel industry and its basic construction strength (including geological exploration, design, and construction strength) will have considerable growth, and will create conditions for further large-scale construction of the fuel industry.
    The basic construction work of the fuel industry is arduous and complex. It takes about seven or eight years to build a mine with an annual output of one million tons of coal, or a refinery that processes one million tons of crude oil annually; the time required to build a large hydropower station is even longer. Therefore, in the construction of the fuel industry, we must proceed from a comprehensive and long-term perspective, and formulate construction plans in a practical and meticulous manner according to the needs of national construction and the distribution of resources, so that the development of the fuel industry adapts to the current and future needs of the country.
    Based on these circumstances, the construction of the fuel industry must be carried out in strict accordance with the general policy of "focusing on key projects and advancing steadily." In terms of coal mines, we should first concentrate our efforts to ensure the supply of coal and electricity to our country's important industrial bases and new industrial bases, especially the supply of coking coal for iron and steel smelting. Because the construction of these industrial bases is the foundation for ensuring our country's realization of socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense. To this end, the fuel industry department must clearly divide labor and cooperate closely with the Ministry of Geology to quickly ascertain the burial situation of coking coal near these industrial bases or other mining areas, and provide the necessary, economically sound, and regionally balanced resource materials to cooperate with and ensure the normal progress of the construction plans of these new industrial bases. It should also be pointed out here that, under the premise of ensuring key projects, attention should also be paid to newly built and expanded mines, because these mines play a very important role in ensuring the supply of industrial coal.
    In terms of electricity industry construction, due to the development of our country's economic construction, the amount of electricity used by industry has greatly increased, so it is necessary to rapidly increase electricity production to ensure supply. Also, because the construction time of thermal power plants in the electricity industry is relatively short, generally about three years; we have also accumulated certain experience in construction projects. Based on these conditions, thermal power plants should be the focus of construction in the first five-year construction plan. But at the same time, hydropower station construction plans should also be appropriately arranged. Our country is a country with extremely rich hydropower resources, and the hydropower industry has broad development prospects, which must not be ignored. However, the construction of hydropower stations is a relatively long-term and complex task. The construction investment is also larger than that of thermal power plants. We cannot immediately start building large hydropower stations at present. Based on some of the conditions we have today, the needs of national economic construction, and the current situation of hydropower data, it is possible and necessary to start building some medium-sized, small-sized, and individual larger hydropower stations. Only through the construction of these medium-sized and small-sized hydropower stations can we gradually strengthen our technical force and accumulate experience, so as to create conditions for the construction of large hydropower stations. Hydropower work is a relatively complex work, and it is closely related to many national economic sectors such as water conservancy, shipping, and agriculture. In order to make the most rational use of hydropower resources, when formulating the construction plan of hydropower stations, the Ministry of Fuel Industry and other relevant economic departments must establish a regular and close cooperative relationship, conduct joint research, unify their steps, and divide labor and cooperate.
    In terms of the construction of the petroleum industry: because our country's natural and artificial petroleum industry foundation is relatively weak and the technical force is insufficient, and the construction of the petroleum industry is particularly complex, the current policy should be to concentrate the use of forces to carry out construction in a planned and focused manner. On the one hand, it is necessary to actively organize a greater force to find out the geological structure of natural petroleum and other petroleum resources, and provide reliable data for new refineries and the future development of the petroleum industry; on the other hand, we must also pay close attention to the restoration and expansion of the artificial petroleum industry in Northeast China, and actively try to strengthen the technical force to prepare conditions for the future construction tasks of the larger-scale petroleum industry.
    At present, the key to determining the construction progress of coal mines, oil wells, and hydropower stations is the issue of resource exploration. This is the fundamental issue in the construction of the fuel industry and must be raised to the primary position and actively improve the work in this area. One of the characteristics of the fuel industry is that it conducts production by developing and utilizing various natural resources. To build coal mines, oil wells, and hydropower stations, we must conduct thorough geological surveys to ascertain various relevant natural conditions (geology, hydrology, resources, etc.), and then it is possible to make a comprehensive development plan that conforms to long-term interests and a correct design. If the resource situation is unclear, all construction projects cannot be discussed. In the past, due to our lack of experience in this area and the weak foundation of geological work, the result was that both basic construction and production were seriously affected because geological work could not keep up. Now, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has actively strengthened its leadership over geological work, adjusted the geological work team, and strengthened the geological work organization, which is completely necessary. While actively and gradually strengthening the geological force, we must also strive to give full play to the role of existing geological personnel, help them improve their professional level, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and improve the quality of geological work. In this regard, the fuel industry department and the Ministry of Geology and other relevant departments must take effective measures to strive to train a group of geological work cadres who can work independently in about three years, and reverse the situation that geological exploration work lags behind the needs of fuel industry construction.
    While carrying out basic construction, all departments of the fuel industry must also strive to strengthen their leadership over existing production work. In recent years, due to the gradual development of various construction undertakings of the state and the rapid increase in the population of urban industrial and mining areas, there is currently a tense situation of insufficient supply in coal and electricity production. It is estimated that this tense situation will continue to exist for a considerable period before the state's large new coal mines and power stations are completed. Therefore, striving to improve the production potential of the existing fuel industry is a very important task.
    At present, the main link in improving coal mine production lies in strengthening coal mine production preparation work. The current serious problem generally existing in coal mines in various places is that there is not enough reserve force for production: tunneling cannot keep up with mining; and geological work cannot keep up with tunneling. The three main links of coal mine production are disconnected from each other and lose balance, which is the basic reason why the production capacity of coal mines cannot be fully utilized. The reason why this situation has formed is inseparable from the poor planning and improper management of coal mine production in the past. In the past, many coal mines only cared about completing the immediate production tasks in production, but did not pay attention to preparing conditions for the next step of production, resulting in increased accidents, decreased quality, and the inability to complete tasks evenly. In order to improve the current production situation, coal mines in various places must take effective methods and resolute steps to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work, solve the geological exploration problems of production mines, pay attention to safe production and product quality, and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan.
    The key to improving existing power industry work is to strengthen safe power generation and transmission. At present, what general enterprises fear most in production is power outages, because the losses caused by unsafe power supply to production are very large. Therefore, the primary and regular task of the power industry department is to strictly implement the safety responsibility system and strengthen the planned maintenance of equipment, especially power supply equipment. In order to solve the current tense situation in which regional load and regional output cannot be matched, the power industry department must quickly study and solve the problem of adjusting the power grid, so that power generation and power supply equipment can be balanced, so as to further exert the potential power in our country's power industry from the aspects of safe production, saving electricity, and other aspects.
    As for the production of the petroleum industry, we should focus on the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu and the Fushun Oil Plant, strive to improve the oil refining rate, improve oil extraction methods, increase the output of natural petroleum in the Northwest, and ensure the completion of the task of transporting crude oil to the East, so as to make full use of the equipment of existing factories and mines.
    Comrades in the fuel industry department have overcome many difficulties and achieved great achievements in restoring and developing the fuel industry in recent years. The glorious mission undertaken by the fuel industry in the national socialist industrialization cause requires comrades in the fuel industry department to work more carefully and cautiously, give full play to their active spirit, overcome shortcomings in their work, establish the determination and confidence to devote themselves to the construction of the fuel industry, and strive to realize the great cause of national socialist industrialization.

    积极发展燃料工业
    燃料工业（包括煤炭、电力、石油）是国民经济中的重要组成部分。要建设强大的现代化的工业和现代化的国防，就必须建设与此相适应的燃料工业，保证有充足的电力、煤炭和石油的供应。所以，积极发展燃料工业，是我国工业化建设中的一项重要任务。中央人民政府燃料工业部根据国家的建设计划，对于今后发展燃料工业做了全面的部署，这是非常必要的。
    过去几年中，在燃料工业全体职工的努力和苏联专家热诚无私的帮助下，我们曾大力进行了燃料工业的恢复、改造和重点建设工作，供应了国家工业恢复时期所需要的燃料和电力，基本上保证了国家经济恢复工作的进行，保证了广大人民日常生活中对燃料的需要。今年国家对燃料工业的建设投资相当于去年的二点四倍，接近于过去三年国家投资的总和。这些投资项目中，包括七十项煤、电、石油的建设工程，一百二十处煤田和六十一处石油资源的勘测工作，以及为将来建设水电站而进行的黄河、汉水、新安江等河流的水文测量和地质钻探工作。完成了这些建设工程之后，我国燃料工业的产量及其基本建设的力量（包括地质勘探、设计和施工的力量）都将有相当的增长，并为进一步的大规模建设燃料工业创造了条件。
    燃料工业的基本建设工作是艰巨和复杂的。建设一个年产一百万吨煤的矿井，或建设一个每年处理一百万吨原油的炼油厂，约需七、八年时间；建设一个大型水力发电站，所需的时间就更长。因此，在燃料工业建设上，就必须从全面的长远的观点出发，按照国家建设的需要和资源分布的状况，来切实周密地研究和制订建设计划，使得燃料工业的发展适应于国家当前的和今后的需要。
    根据这些情况，燃料工业建设必须切实按照“重点建设、稳步前进”这个总方针来进行，在煤矿方面，首先应当集中力量，保证我国各重要工业基地和新工业基地的煤炭和电力供应，特别是炼铁、炼钢用的焦煤的供应。因为这些工业基地的建设是保证我国实现社会主义工业化和实现国防现代化的基础。为此，燃料工业部门必须与地质部明确分工和密切合作，迅速查明这些工业基地附近的或其他矿区炼焦煤的埋藏情况，提供必需的、合乎经济原则的和照顾地区平衡的资源材料，以配合并保证这些新的工业基地建设计划的正常进行。这里也需要指出：在保证重点的前提下，对新建的和扩建的矿井也应该加以重视，因为这些矿井对保证工业用煤的供应起着极大的作用。
    在电力工业建设方面，由于我国经济建设的发展，工业用电量大大增加，因此必须迅速增加电力生产以保证供应。又由于在电力工业建设中，火力发电站的建设时间较短，一般的三年左右即可完成；建设工程上我们也已积累了一定经验。根据这些条件，在第一个五年建设计划中，就应当以火力发电站作为建设的重点。但同时，也要适当地安排水力发电站的建设计划。我国是一个水力资源极其丰富的国家，水力发电事业有着远大的发展前途，决不能忽视。但水力发电站的建设是一件比较长期的和复杂的工作。建设投资也比火力发电站为大。我们目前还不可能立即动手来建设大型的水力发电站。根据我们今天已有的一些条件和国家经济建设的需要，以及现有水力资料的情况，着手建设一些中、小型的和个别较大型的水电站，则是可能的和必需的。通过这些中、小型的水电站的建设，我们才能逐步地壮大技术力量，积累经验，从而为建设大型水电站创造条件。水力发电工作是一件比较复杂的工作，它和水利、航运、农业等等许多国民经济部门有着密切的关联，为了能够最合理地利用水力资源，在制订水电站的建设计划时，中央燃料工业部和其他有关经济部门，必须建立起经常的密切合作的关系，共同来进行研究，统一步调，分工合作。
    在石油工业的建设方面：由于我国天然与人造石油工业基础都比较薄弱，技术力量不够，而石油工业的建设又特别复杂，因此目前的方针应该是集中使用力量有步骤有重点的进行建设，一方面需要积极组织更大力量查清天然石油地质构造和其他石油资源，为新建的炼油厂和今后石油工业的发展提供可靠资料；另方面对东北人造石油工业的恢复和扩建也必须十分注意，并积极设法壮大技术力量，为将来更大规模的石油工业的建设任务准备条件。
    目前决定煤矿、石油井和水电站建设进度的关键，是资源勘察问题，这是燃料工业建设中的根本问题，必须把它提到首要地位来，积极地改进这方面的工作。燃料工业的特点之一，就是它是以开发和利用各种自然资源来进行生产的。要建设煤矿、油井和水力发电站，都必须通过周密的地质勘测，查清各种有关自然情况（地质、水文、资源等等），然后才可能作出全面的、符合长远利益的开发计划和正确的设计，如果资源情况不明，一切建设工程都无从谈起。过去由于我们这方面缺乏经验，地质工作的基础薄弱，结果使基本建设和生产都因为地质工作跟不上而受到严重影响。现在，燃料工业部已积极加强了对地质工作的领导，调整了地质工作的队伍，加强了地质工作的机构，这样做是完全必要的。在积极地逐渐地壮大地质力量的同时，还必须努力发挥现有地质人员的作用，帮助他们提高业务水平，学习苏联先进经验，改善地质工作的质量。在这一方面，燃料工业部门和地质部等有关部门必须采取有效措施，争取在三年左右时间内，培养出一批能够独立工作的地质工作干部，扭转地质勘探工作落后于燃料工业建设需要的局面。
    在进行基本建设的同时，燃料工业的各部门还必须努力加强对现有生产工作的领导。几年来由于国家各项建设事业的逐步展开和城市工矿区人口的迅速增加，目前在煤炭和电力生产方面已经出现供应不足的紧张状态，估计在国家大的新建煤矿和电站未完成前的一个相当时期内，这种紧张状态仍会继续存在，因此努力提高现有燃料工业的生产潜力是一项十分重要的工作。
    目前提高煤矿生产的主要环节，是在于加强煤矿生产准备工作。各地煤矿中当前普遍存在的严重问题，是没有足够的生产后备力量：掘进赶不上回采；地质工作又赶不上掘进。煤矿生产的这三个主要环节互相脱节，失去平衡，这是阻碍煤矿生产能力不能充分发挥的基本原因。这种情况的所以形成，是和过去煤矿生产上的计划不周和管理不当分不开的，不少煤矿过去在生产中只顾突击完成眼前的生产任务，而不注意为下一步生产准备条件，结果是事故增多，质量下降，使任务不能均衡完成。为了改进现在的生产状况，各地煤矿必须采取有效的方法和坚决的步骤，加强掘进工作的领导，解决生产矿井的地质勘探问题，注意安全生产与产品质量，力争全面地完成和超额完成国家计划。
    提高现有电业工作的关键，是加强安全发电和送电。目前一般企业生产中最害怕的就是停电，因为供电不安全给生产上造成的损失是很大的。因此电业部门首要的和经常的任务，就是必须严格执行安全专责制度，加强设备、尤其是供电设备的计划检修工作。为了解决目前地区负荷与地区出力不能配合的紧张状态，电业部门必须迅速研究解决调整电力网问题，使发电供电的设备得到平衡，以便从安全生产、节约用电及其他方面，进一步发挥我国电力工业中的潜在力量。
    至于石油工业的生产，应以甘肃的玉门油矿和抚顺油厂为重点，努力提高炼油率，改进采油方法，增加西北天然石油产量，和保证完成原油东运任务，以便充分利用现有厂矿的设备。
    燃料工业部门的同志几年来在恢复和发展燃料工业中克服了许多困难，获得了很大的成绩。燃料工业在国家社会主义工业化事业中担负的光荣使命，要求燃料工业部门的同志必须更加百倍小心谨慎地从事工作，发挥积极精神，克服工作中的缺点，确立献身于燃料工业建设的决心和信心，为实现国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业而奋斗。
