    A Trick Can Save Over 20 Billion Yuan
    ——Tangshan Steel Plant Worker Cai Liancheng Creates New Steelmaking Method
    Meng Jiejun
    In early September, the employees of the Tangshan Steel Plant's steelmaking department launched a production increase and savings competition. Soon after, the technicians discovered the potential to expand the furnace hearth, and the output suddenly increased by 18%, ensuring the overfulfillment of the production increase plan. However, completing the savings plan was still a challenge.

    At that time, the key obstacle preventing the steelmaking department from completing the savings plan was the excessively high consumption of raw materials, especially the blowing loss during steelmaking, which frequently exceeded the national quota. Cai Liancheng, an assistant steelworker, had been pondering this matter for a while. In less than two months, he created a new steelmaking method that reduced the pig iron consumption rate from 14-15% to 8.5% (the national quota was 12.5%), saving the country 20.38 billion yuan annually, ensuring the completion of the steelmaking department's savings plan.

    Enthusiasm and Determination

    Cai Liancheng is a member of the Communist Youth League and usually pays close attention to production matters. Once, after he finished loading molten iron into the steelmaking furnace, as soon as he opened the blast gate, large chunks of molten iron were blown out and landed behind the steelmaking furnace. It pained him to see this molten iron being blown out and turned into waste instead of being refined into steel! But no matter how carefully he operated according to the old steelmaking method, it was useless; the molten iron kept spraying out.

    After the steel was tapped, Cai Liancheng didn't take a breath before walking behind the steelmaking furnace. He saw that about 400-500 kilograms of molten iron and slag were mixed together and had become scrap steel. He thought, "If you drop a needle in your own home, you pick it up. Shouldn't we pick up this steel used for national construction?" At that moment, he suddenly felt a stinging itch on the back of his hand. He looked and realized he had been burned by molten iron during steelmaking. This reminded him of the painful scenes of other workers being burned by molten iron, and his mood became even heavier. So he secretly made up his mind: "I must find a way to solve this problem."

    The Solution is Right Here

    Strangely enough, ever since Cai Liancheng made up his mind, the pig iron consumption rate increased day by day, especially for their shift, sometimes exceeding 16%. Cai Liancheng arrived at work early and left late every day, often standing beside the steelmaking furnace observing the changes in the flame and the spraying of molten iron, intending to find a way to solve the problem.

    Cai Liancheng seemed obsessed, unable to eat or sleep well. A month passed, and he still hadn't found the cause. One morning, he was lying in bed and shouted, "Tapping steel! Tapping steel!" His wife quickly woke him up, laughing, and said, "What kind of steel are you tapping? I'm calling you to get up and eat!" It turned out that Cai Liancheng had a dream where he reduced the pig iron consumption rate, and he shouted it out in excitement.

    That very day, when Cai Liancheng returned from work in the evening, he sat on the edge of the bed, carefully pondering a sentence that technician Li Huamin had told him: "If we can control the splashing molten iron in the second stage, the pig iron consumption rate will be lower." He held his head in his hands, thinking, and suddenly stared blankly at a bowl of water on the table. "If I use this bowl as a steelmaking furnace and the water in the bowl as molten iron, and find some kind of tube as a blower, wouldn't I be able to test how to prevent the molten iron from splashing?" A smile appeared on his thin face. He turned around and took the rubber tube from the valve stem of his bicycle tire, inserted it into the water, and blew hard with his mouth. The water in the bowl splashed everywhere. He thought, "Could it be that the molten iron is sprayed out because it's being blown from the surface?" So he inserted the rubber tube deeper, blew again, and the water gurgled and churned, but it didn't splash out. He experimented several times from shallow to deep, thinking to himself, "If I blow deep first and then surface blow in the second stage, and then rock the steelmaking furnace according to the changes in the flame, wouldn't I be able to reduce pig iron consumption?" The more he thought about it, the more right it seemed. He slapped his thigh and said, "That's right, the solution is right here!" His wife, seeing his "foolish" appearance, burst out laughing.

    The Struggle Between the New and the Old

    The next day, as soon as it was light, he went to the workshop to take over the shift. It happened to be the second stage of steelmaking. As soon as Cai Liancheng took over the shift, a small piece of molten iron still sparkling with fire landed on the corner of his pants. He stamped his foot, and the red-hot molten iron fell off, but smoke billowed from the corner of his pants. He angrily said, "Let it burn! If you're afraid of being burned, you can't save pig iron for the country." He followed the method he had thought out the night before, holding the blast gate with one hand, gripping the furnace rocking lever with the other, and watching the changes in the flame, constantly rocking the steelmaking furnace. The workers standing next to him saw that the corner of his pants was on fire and helped him put it out.

    After the first furnace was tested, the pig iron consumption rate immediately dropped to 10%, but the phosphorus content in the steel ingot was slightly higher. He thought, "The experiment didn't succeed, and I produced a substandard furnace for the country. How can I explain this?" Wang Jingchun (a Party member and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch), a steelworker who worked with Cai Liancheng, immediately comforted him, saying: "As long as we can reduce pig iron consumption, we must continue to study it. If the phosphorus content is a little high, we'll find a way to solve it." Chang Youyi (secretary of the Party branch), the shift leader, also encouraged him: "Continue to experiment boldly, the Party will help you." In this way, he quickly found the problem with the high phosphorus content - because the slag wasn't melting well. When testing the second furnace, he added enough silica to the steelmaking furnace to ensure that the slag melted well. As a result of the experiment, the problem of high phosphorus content was solved, but the furnace lining and tuyeres quickly broke. When Cai Liancheng saw this situation, he was afraid of causing a leak and didn't dare to experiment anymore.

    At this time, the news of Cai Liancheng's experiment with the new steelmaking method reached the ears of the chief of the Technical Supervision Section. He immediately came to the site and issued an order to Zhao Naibin (a labor model), the second director of the steelmaking department: "The steelmaking method created by Cai Liancheng violates the operating procedures, so stop experimenting." Zhao Naibin, who was helping Cai Liancheng with the experiment, felt that something was wrong when he heard this. He said: "The new operating method is not in the operating procedures, it's something the workers have figured out in the actual production process! It can reduce labor intensity and lower pig iron consumption. The operating procedures can be modified!" That section chief still said, "No!" Zhao Naibin said anxiously: "I suggest holding a technical seminar to study it."

    The technical seminar began. Those who opposed the experiment with the new steelmaking method insisted that the new steelmaking method "violates the operating procedures," "has an impact on the life of the tuyere and furnace lining," and "the physical properties of the steel are not good," and so on. The meeting did not reach a conclusion and ended unhappily.

    The Joy of Success

    The situation of the first technical seminar on the new steelmaking method spread. The Party general branch of the steelmaking department immediately held an enlarged meeting of the general branch and decided to support Cai Liancheng in continuing the experiment.

    Wang Yu, the Party secretary of the steel plant, also learned about it. With his support, a second technical seminar was convened. At the meeting, Comrade Wang Yu criticized the conservative thinking and the bureaucratic work style of not caring about the suffering of the workers. He said: "If the experiment is not successful, the leadership will be responsible; if it is successful, it will be Cai Liancheng's contribution to the motherland." The meeting decided that technicians would help Cai Liancheng continue the experiment.

    The experiment began, and engineer Zhao Naibin helped Cai Liancheng prepare everything. Cai Liancheng was as excited and flustered as a revolutionary soldier preparing for his first charge, but when he thought of the Party's support and the technicians' help, he felt full of energy. The flames from the mouth of the steelmaking furnace shot out fiercely, and people watched his operation with wide eyes. After each furnace of steel was refined, the engineering technicians helped him improve some of the incorrect operating methods. In this way, he experimented for three consecutive days. After testing and technical appraisal, it was proven that the physical properties of the steel were very good, the life of the furnace lining and tuyere were not affected, and especially the pig iron consumption rate was reduced to 8.5%.

     "The experiment was successful!" The good news spread throughout the workshop, and applause and cheers rose and fell. Cai Liancheng smiled, and boundless joy welled up in his heart: "Chairman Mao! From now on, we will save a lot of pig iron for the country, refine more and better steel, and make the country industrialize faster."

    一个窍门能节约二百多亿元
    ——唐山钢厂工人蔡连成创造新炼钢法
    孟杰军
    九月初，唐山钢厂炼钢部的职工展开了增产节约竞赛。没过几天，技术人员挖到了扩大炼钢炉膛的潜力，产量一下子就提高了百分之十八，保证可超额完成增产计划。可是，要完成节约计划还是个难题。
    当时，阻碍着炼钢部完成节约计划的关键是原材料消耗过高，尤其是炼钢中的吹损一项经常超过国家的定额。炼钢工助手蔡连成早就捉摸上了这码事，不到两个月的工夫，他就创造了新的炼钢法，使生铁消耗率由百分之十四—十五降到百分之八点五（国家定额为百分之十二点五），全年可给国家节约二百零三亿八千万元，保证了炼钢部节约计划的完成。
    热情和决心
    蔡连成是个青年团员，平常对生产上的事很留心。有一次，他往炼钢炉里装完了铁水，刚一开风闸，大块大块的铁水就被风吹出来，落在炼钢炉的后边。眼看着这些铁水不能炼成钢而被吹出来变成废品，他是多么痛心啊！但是不管他怎样按着旧的炼钢法细心地操作，却一点事也不顶，铁水还是一个劲地往外喷。
    出完了钢，蔡连成没有喘一口气就往炼钢炉后边走。他一看，约有四、五百公斤的铁水和渣子混在一起，变成了废钢。他想：“在自己的家里掉了
  一根针都拾起来，难道这些建设国家用的钢铁就不应当拾起来吗？”这时候他忽地又觉得手背上有些疼痒，一看才知道是在炼钢时被铁水烫伤了。这时他记起了别的工人被铁水烫伤后的痛苦情景，心情更沉重了。于是他暗暗地下了决心：“非想办法解决这个问题不可。”
    办法就在这里
    说也蹩扭，从蔡连成下了决心以来，生铁消耗率一天比一天高，尤其是他们这个班有时高到百分之十六以上。蔡连成每天早上班晚下班，常常站在炼钢炉的旁边观察着火焰变化和往外喷溅铁水的情况，打算在这里找出个道道来。
    蔡连成像着了迷似的，吃不好也睡不安，一个月过去了，他还没有找出原因来。一天早晨，他躺在炕上喊：“出钢了！出钢了！”他的爱人赶忙推醒他，笑着说：“出的是什么钢呀？叫你起来吃饭哩！”原来是蔡连成作了个梦，把生铁消耗率降低了，一高兴就喊了出来。
    就在这一天蔡连成晚上下班回来，坐在炕沿上，细细地琢磨着技术员李化民告诉他的一句话：
  “要是在第二期能控制喷溅铁水，生铁消耗率就低了。”他两只手抱着头想，想着想着，忽地瞅着桌子上放的一碗水出了神：“把这个碗当成炼钢炉，碗里的水当成铁水，再找到什么管子当鼓风机，这不就可以试验怎样才能不喷铁水了吗？”消瘦的脸上出现了笑容，他转身就把自行车轮“气门心”上的胶皮管取下来，插在水面，用嘴一股劲地吹，碗里的水被吹得四面飞溅。他想：“莫不是因为从表面上吹的缘故，铁水才被喷出来。”于是又把胶皮管往深里一插，再一吹，水就咕嘟咕嘟地上下直翻，但不往外喷了。他由浅到深一连试验了几次，心里揣摩着：“要是在第二期先深吹，再面吹，然后根据火焰变化情况摇动炼钢炉，不就能降低生铁消耗了吗？”他越捉摸越觉得对劲，往大腿上一拍，说：“对，办法就在这里！”他的爱人看他“傻气”的样子，噗哧地笑了起来。
    新和旧的斗争
    第二天天刚放亮，他就到车间去接班。正赶巧这班是炼钢第二期。蔡连成刚接过班来，一小块还冒着火花的铁水就落在他的裤角上。他跺了跺脚，火红的铁水落了下来，可是裤角上却冒了烟。他气愤地说道：“烧吧，怕烧就不能给国家节约生铁。”他照着昨天晚上想好了的办法，一只手把着风闸，
  一只手握着摇炉杆，眼睛看着火焰的变化，不时地摇转炼钢炉。站在他旁边的工人看到他裤角着了火，就帮助他熄灭了。
    第一炉试验完了，生铁消耗率一下子就降到百分之十，但在钢锭质量方面燐的成分却高了些。他想：“试验没有成功，又给国家弄出了一炉次品来，这可怎么交代呢？”和蔡连成一起工作的炼钢工王景春（党员，团支部书记）当场就安慰他说：
  “只要能降低生铁消耗，就要继续研究它；燐的成分多少高些，咱再想办法解决。”值班长常友义（党支部书记）也鼓励他：“要继续大胆地试验，党会帮助你的。”就这样，他很快就找到了燐高的毛病——因为渣子没有熔化好。在试验第二炉时，他为了使渣子熔化好，就往炼钢炉里添足了石英石。试验结果，解决了磷高的问题，但炉衬和风眼都很快就坏了。蔡连成一看这个情况，怕弄出漏子来，就不敢再试验了。
    正在这时候，蔡连成试验新炼钢法的消息传到了技术监督科科长的耳朵里了，他当时就来到现场，向炼钢部第二主任赵乃斌（劳动模范）下命令：“蔡连成弄出的炼钢法违反操作规程，别试验了。”正在帮助蔡连成作试验的赵乃斌一听，觉得有点不对劲，他说：“新操作法在操作规程上是没有的，这是工人在实际生产过程里摸出来的！它既能减轻劳动强度，又能降低生铁消耗。操作规程可以修改！”那位科长还说“不行！”急得赵乃斌说：
  “我建议开个技术座谈会研究一下。”
    技术座谈会开始了。反对试验新炼钢法的人一直咬定新炼钢法“违反操作规程”，“对风眼对炉衬寿命有影响”，“钢的物理性不好”等等。这个会上没有得出个结论，就不欢而散了。
    成功的喜悦
    第一次新炼钢法技术座谈会的情况传开了。炼钢部党总支立时开了个总支扩大会议，决定支持蔡连成继续试验。
    钢厂党委书记王玉也知道了，在他的支持之下，又召开了第二次技术座谈会。会上王玉同志批判了保守思想和不关心工人痛苦的官僚主义作风。他说：“试验不成功，由领导上负责；成功了便是蔡连成对祖国的贡献。”会上决定由技术人员帮助蔡连成继续试验。
    试验开始了，工程师赵乃斌帮助蔡连成作好了一切准备工作。蔡连成就像革命战士初次准备冲锋那样，又兴奋又有些发慌，但他一想到党的支持和技术人员的帮助，浑身都有了劲。炼钢炉口的火焰猛烈地喷射着，人们都睁大了眼睛看着他的操作。每炼完一炉钢，工程技术人员就帮助他改进部分不正确的操作方法。就这样，一连试验了三天，经过化验和技术鉴定，证明钢的物理性很好，炉衬寿命和风眼都没有影响，尤其是生铁消耗率一下子就降到百分之八点五。
     “试验成功了！”喜讯传遍了车间，掌声和欢呼声此伏彼起。蔡连成微笑着，无限的喜悦涌上了心头：“毛主席！打这起，我们就要给国家节约大量的生铁，炼出更多更好的钢来，使国家快点工业化。”
