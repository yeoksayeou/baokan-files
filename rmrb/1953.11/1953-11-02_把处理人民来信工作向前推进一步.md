    Further Advance the Work of Handling People's Letters

    Early this year, the Party Central Committee instructed all localities to start the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline by handling people's letters, which has led to further attention to this work in various places. At present, most leadership organs above the county level have equipped themselves with full-time cadres and established handling systems. Many leading cadres personally read more important people's letters and receive people's visits. Many cadres have also begun to realize the political significance of handling people's letters, understanding that people's letters are a good way for the people to supervise the work of cadres, a yardstick for measuring the implementation of policies by the Party and the People's Government, and are able to handle people's letters with a serious and responsible attitude. Many high-level leading organs (various central bureaus, sub-bureaus, and many provincial and municipal Party committees and People's Governments) have held several special meetings to make arrangements, inspections, and summaries, which have played a significant role in promoting this work.

    Because the criticisms and suggestions of the people have been valued and have produced practical results, the number of letters and visits from the people in various places has been increasing. In areas where this work has been carried out better, the situation of people's letters has also undergone the following changes: in the past, people's letters almost only made criticisms and suggestions to the district and township People's Governments and grassroots Party organizations, but now people's letters also make criticisms and suggestions to the Party and government leading organs and responsible cadres above the county level; in the past, the masses were unwilling to directly express their opinions to lower-level Party and government organs and often made them to higher-level leading organs, but now the number of letters from the masses directly to counties and districts has greatly increased compared to the past, and the number of letters transferred down from various departments of the central government and large administrative regions has relatively decreased; in the past, people's letters mostly made simple criticisms, with few constructive suggestions, but now the number of critical letters that simultaneously put forward positive suggestions has greatly increased; in the past, there were many anonymous letters due to fear of retaliation, but now the number of letters with real names has greatly increased.

    These new situations show that the people's trust in the Party and the People's Government is growing. Comrade Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "It is wrong to think that criticism from below can unfold automatically in a spontaneous way. Criticism from below can only unfold and expand when everyone who makes healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization and that the shortcomings he points out will be truly eliminated." Our experience here also proves this truth. Through the serious handling of people's letters, on the one hand, cadres have been educated and their mass viewpoint has been strengthened; on the other hand, the masses have also been educated, and their political awareness and sense of responsibility to supervise cadres and participate in the management of state affairs have been improved. This has effectively promoted the development of the struggle against bureaucracy, strengthened the ties between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, greatly promoted the potential wisdom of the people, and opened up channels for pooling wisdom to build our great motherland.

    However, these achievements are still preliminary, and the development in various places is still very uneven, so we must never be satisfied with the existing achievements. Handling people's letters is an important method for the Communist Party and the People's Government to contact the masses, not a temporary crash task. Although some regions have explored some experiences and gradually regularized the work of handling people's letters, there are still many regions with cold and hot phenomena, and after a period of attention, they have become indifferent again. Although many regions pay attention to it, they have not found practical and feasible ways to persist in handling people's letters seriously. In some regions, there are still serious phenomena of irresponsibly forwarding letters level by level and shunting responsibilities to each other, resulting in a large backlog of people's letters and sloppy and delayed handling. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and promote existing experience, and to advance the work of handling people's letters universally, so that Party and government organs at all levels regard paying attention to handling people's letters as a very important and regular work.

    Whether or not we can always pay attention to handling people's letters depends on whether we have the determination to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy regularly. Because only with the determination to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy regularly, will we always listen to the opinions of the broad masses, feel the preciousness of always receiving people's letters, and realize that we must use the opinions of the masses to regularly sweep away dust, promote and improve our various tasks. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in "Against the Vulgarization of the Slogan of Self-Criticism": "It is necessary to more stubbornly arouse millions of workers and peasant masses to carry out criticism from below and to implement supervision from below as the main disinfectant against bureaucracy." As long as we have this determination, the leading cadres of the leading organs will pay attention to studying and improving the work of handling people's letters, and will organize the necessary forces and come up with practical and feasible ways to solve the difficulties in this work. At present, there are still many regions that only shout about the difficulties such as too many people's letters, too complicated problems, and too few cadres, which has led to the stagnation of this work. The leading cadres in these regions should raise the handling of people's letters to such a principle to consider: Do you have the determination to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy regularly? This is the key to determining whether we can regard the handling of people's letters as a very important and regular task.

    At present, the number of people's letters has been increasing day by day, the problems are also very complicated, and there are few cadres to handle them. Is there a way to solve this difficulty? There is a way. The experience of many regions has already proved this point. The main method is to follow the mass line; that is, to pay attention to training and educating the broad masses of cadres, especially district and township cadres and people's representatives, to handle people's letters together. Some provincial and prefectural leading organs do not pay attention to improving and cultivating the understanding of lower-level cadres on the letters from the people and their ability to handle them; once they receive a letter, they forward it down level by level, only assigning tasks and setting deadlines, but not explaining the methods, and never conducting inspections or providing assistance, which has resulted in some counties and districts handling people's letters sloppily, and even accumulating them in large quantities. Some regions only rely on a few full-time cadres to handle people's letters, resulting in a large number of letters being concentrated, and they are overwhelmed. However, in many regions, under the unified leadership of the responsible comrades of the Party committee, people's letters are distributed to the relevant organs for handling, and the organs are helped to improve their work ability and work efficiency from the serious handling of letters, especially paying attention to helping district and township cadres to do a good job in handling people's letters, so that the broad masses trust them. This method of mobilizing Party and government organs at all levels to pay attention to handling people's letters will change the phenomenon that people's letters are concentrated in high-level leading organs and concentrated in Party committee organs. Many regions have also paid attention to handling people's letters through people's congresses at all levels, which is a more mass-line method worth promoting.

    Experience has proved that discussing and handling people's letters in conjunction with the central task through the township people's congress is the most effective and simple method for district and township organizations to handle people's letters. Because people's representatives have close ties with the masses and are most familiar with the situation, they can represent the opinions of the masses and solve various problems fairly and reasonably. People's letters are a method of promoting democracy and opposing bureaucracy, and combining them with the people's congress can not only enrich the content of the people's congress, understand and solve the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved, but also handle people's letters in a timely, correct and large-scale manner. This will greatly promote various tasks, and can improve the ability of district and township cadres and people's representatives to distinguish right from wrong and handle problems, and establish their prestige among the masses.

    When handling people's letters by various methods, we must pay attention to using people's letters as much as possible to help solve problems in production and other current work. People's letters sometimes seem to be "small things" or "personal interests," but if we study them carefully, we can find that most of them are related to production, related to policies, and are universal problems. Therefore, it is completely necessary and possible to combine the handling of people's letters with production and current work. After receiving a letter requesting the installation of a waterwheel, the Laiyang Prefectural Cooperative used the spirit of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance" to generally inspect the work of lending waterwheels by the cooperative, and actively organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to install waterwheels, and incidentally solved many problems such as adding parts and improving water cylinders. This combines the handling of people's letters with the overall work, and considers the handling of people's letters from the perspective of the overall work, thereby promoting the overall work. After receiving a people's letter, as long as each organ has this spirit of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance" and considers the handling in connection with production and the overall work, it will actively carry out work and actively solve many problems that the masses have not yet raised.

    To regularize the work of handling people's letters, we must also pay attention to receiving visits from the people. Many regions have already paid attention to this work, and there have been methods such as county magistrates regularly receiving the masses, which have been warmly welcomed by the masses. However, leading cadres (such as county magistrates and commissioners) receiving the masses does not mean that only one person goes to receive all the visitors and handle all the problems in one day. Leading cadres regularly receive the people in a special way, on the one hand, naturally to directly solve some problems for the masses, but the more important aspect is to lead by example, drive all responsible cadres to develop the good style of directly receiving the masses, educate the broad masses of cadres to care about the sufferings of the masses at any time and any place, patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, and solve problems for the masses.

    At present, judging from the situation of people's letters across the country, the proportion of letters from workers is still small, and there are even fewer opinions on industrial construction, which is not commensurate with the current situation where planned economic construction has begun. All our undertakings are mass undertakings, and economic construction is no exception. Only when the masses, especially the workers, give deep concern, seriously supervise, and constantly put forward improvement opinions, can economic construction be carried out smoothly. Therefore, Party organizations in enterprises should pay attention to mobilizing workers to put forward opinions, pay attention to workers' letters, and Party committee leaders should also take time to regularly go to factories and mines to meet with workers and listen to their opinions with an open mind. The supervisory departments should carry out the work of handling workers' letters in factories and mines. When handling workers' letters, we should not only keenly discover the shortcomings in the work, but also use various methods to encourage and inspire workers to put forward constructive opinions, and we should pay special attention to workers' rationalization proposals. Some factories and mines have many rationalization proposals put forward by workers that have not been adopted, causing great dissatisfaction among workers and causing undue losses to the country. This phenomenon must be corrected. We must use the fact that we seriously adopt the rationalization proposals of the workers to encourage the workers to put forward a large number of valuable constructive opinions!

### 把处理人民来信工作向前推进一步

    把处理人民来信工作向前推进一步
    今年年初，党中央指示各地开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争要从处理人民来信入手，这引起各地进一步重视这项工作。目前大部分县以上的领导机关配备了专职干部，建立了处理制度，不少领导干部亲自批阅较重大的人民来信和接见人民来访。许多干部并开始体会到处理人民来信的政治意义，懂得了人民来信是人民群众监督干部工作的好办法，是测量党和人民政府贯彻政策的标尺，能够以认真负责的态度处理人民来信。许多高级领导机关（各中央局、分局、不少省市委和省市人民政府）召开过几次专门会议来进行布置、检查和总结，对这项工作更起了重大的推动作用。
    由于人民群众的批评和建议受到了重视，产生了实际的效果，各地人民群众的来信来访日渐增加。在这一工作开展得较好的地区，人民来信的情况还产生了以下的变化：过去人民来信几乎只对区乡人民政府和党的基层组织提出批评建议，现在人民来信对于县以上的党政领导机关和负责干部也提出批评建议；过去群众对下级党政机关有意见不愿意直接提出，常常向上级领导机关提出，现在群众直接向县、区来信已较前大为增加，从中央、大行政区各部门转下去的来信已相对减少；过去人民来信单纯提出批评的多，建设性的建议少，现在的批评信件同时提出积极建议的大为增加；过去由于怕打击报复因而匿名信较多，现在真名信件大为增加。
    这些新的情况表明人民群众对党和人民政府的信任日渐增长。马林科夫同志在联共十九次代表大会上报告中说：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以消除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。”我们这里的经验也证明了这个真理。经过认真处理人民来信，一方面教育了干部，加强了干部的群众观念；另一方面也教育了群众，提高了群众政治觉悟与监督干部、参与管理国家大事的责任感。这就有效地推动了反对官僚主义斗争的开展，密切了党和人民政府同群众的联系，大大发扬了人民群众中潜在的智慧，为集思广益建设我们伟大的祖国畅通了言路。
    但是这种成绩还是初步的，而且各地发展的情况还很不平衡，因而我们绝不能满足于现有的成绩。处理人民来信是共产党和人民政府联系群众的一种重要方法，不是临时的突击任务。虽然有的地区已摸索出一些经验，把处理人民来信工作逐渐经常化，但是还有不少地区有冷热现象，在一度重视以后又冷淡下来。有不少地区虽然重视，但还没有找到切实可行的办法来坚持认真处理人民来信。有的地区仍然有层层照转，互相推诿等不负责任的严重现象，以致造成当地大批人民来信的积压和处理上的拖延潦草。因此，必须对现有的经验加以总结和推广，把处理人民来信工作普遍向前推进一步，使各级党政机关把重视处理人民来信都当成一项十分重要的经常工作。
    能否经常注意处理人民来信，决定于是否具有经常进行反对官僚主义斗争的决心。因为只有具有经常进行反官僚主义斗争的决心，才会经常听取广大群众的意见，才会感到经常得到人民来信的可贵，才会体会到必须用群众意见来经常打扫灰尘、推动和改进我们的各项工作。正如斯大林同志在“反对把自我批评口号庸俗化”一文中所指出的：“应当更加顽强地唤起千百万工人和农民群众来进行从下而上的批评，来实行从下而上的监督，以作为对付官僚主义的主要消毒剂。”只要有了这种决心，就会由领导机关的领导干部来重视研究改进处理人民来信的工作，就会组织必要的力量和想出切实可行的办法来解决这一工作中的困难。目前还有不少地区只是叫喊人民来信太多、问题太复杂、干部太少等困难，以致使这一工作陷于停滞不前的状态；这些地区的领导干部应该把处理人民来信提高到这样的原则上来考虑：你是否有经常进行反官僚主义斗争的决心？这就是决定我们是否能把处理人民来信当成一项十分重要的经常工作的关键。
    目前人民来信已日渐增多，问题也很复杂，而处理的干部又少，这个困难有没有办法解决呢？有办法。很多地区的经验已经证明了这点。主要的办法就是走群众路线；就是注意培养和教育广大干部，特别是区乡干部和人民代表一齐动手处理人民来信。有的省和专区领导机关不注意提高和培养下级干部对人民群众来信的认识和处理来信的能力；一收到来信就层层照转下去，只交任务、定期限，不交代作法，也从未进行过检查、帮助，以致某些县区对人民来信处理得潦草，甚至大批积压起来。也有的地区只依靠少数专职干部处理人民来信，结果来信大批集中上来，应接不暇。但是在不少地区在党委负责同志的统一领导下，把人民来信分配到有关各机关处理，并有重点地帮助各机关从认真处理来信中提高他们的工作能力和工作效率，特别是注意帮助区乡干部作好处理人民来信工作，使广大群众信任他们。这样发动各级党政机关都来重视处理人民来信的办法，就会转变人民来信集中于高级领导机关而且集中于党委机关的现象。不少地区还注意了通过各级人民代表会议来处理人民来信，更是值得推广的群众路线的办法。
    经验证明，通过乡人民代表会议结合中心工作讨论处理，是区乡组织处理人民来信最有效最简便的方法。因为人民代表和群众有密切的联系，最熟悉情况，他们能够代表群众意见，公平合理地解决各种问题。人民来信是发扬民主、反对官僚主义的
  一种方法，和人民代表会议结合起来，既能够充实人民代表会议的内容，了解和解决当前群众迫切要求解决的问题，又能及时地正确地大批地处理人民来信。这就会大大推动各项工作，并能提高区乡干部和人民代表辨别是非和处理问题的能力，树立他们在群众中的威信。
    用各种方法处理人民来信，都必须注意尽可能利用人民来信来帮助解决生产和其他当前工作中的问题。人民来信有时看起来似乎是“小事情”、是“个人利益”，但如果认真研究起来，就可以发现其中大部分是与生产有关、与政策有关，是具有普遍性的问题。因而处理人民来信与生产和当前工作相结合是完全必要和可能的。莱阳专区合作社接到一件要求安装水车的来信后，就以“举一反三”的精神，普遍检查了该社贷放水车的工作，主动地组织大批干部下乡安装水车，并附带解决了添零件、改进水筒等很多问题。这就把处理人民来信和全盘工作结合起来，并从全盘工作出发考虑处理人民来信，从而推动全盘工作。每个机关接到一件人民来信后，只要具有这种“举一反三”的精神，联系起生产和全盘工作考虑处理，就会主动开展工作，主动解决群众还未提出来的很多问题。
    要使处理人民来信工作经常化还必须重视接见人民群众的来访。不少地区已经注意这一工作，而且出现县长定期接见群众等等受到群众热烈欢迎的办法。但是领导干部（如县长、专员）接见群众不等于只是一人一天去接见所有来访的人，处理所有的问题。领导干部定期专门接见人民群众，一方面自然是为了直接给群众解决一些问题，而更主要的方面还在于以身作则，带动全体负责干部养成直接接见群众的优良作风，教育广大干部随时随地关心群众的疾苦，耐心倾听群众的意见，为群众解决问题。
    目前，从全国人民来信情况来看，工人群众的来信比重还小，有关工业建设方面的意见更少，这与有计划的经济建设已开始的当前形势不相称。我们的一切事业都是群众性的事业，经济建设也不例外。只有群众，特别是工人群众给以深切的关怀，认真地进行监督，并不断提出改进的意见，经济建设才能顺利开展。因此，企业中的党组织要注意发动工人群众提意见，重视工人来信，党委负责人还应抽时间经常到工厂矿山去接见工人群众，虚心地听取他们的意见。监察部门应在工厂矿山开展处理工人来信的工作。在处理工人来信时，不仅要锐敏地发现工作中的缺点，而且要用各种方法鼓励和启发工人提出建设性的意见，要特别重视工人的合理化建议。有的厂矿工人提出很多合理化建议都没有被采纳，引起工人很大不满，给国家造成不应有的损失。这种现象必须纠正。必须用认真采纳工人群众合理化建议的事实，来鼓励工人群众提出大量的宝贵的建设性意见！
