    Peasants in Liaoxi and Heilongjiang Provinces Enthusiastically Sell Grain
    [Our Newspaper] Peasants in Liaoxi and Heilongjiang provinces in Northeast China are actively selling surplus grain to support national economic construction.
    In Liaoxi Province, the state-owned grain company purchased a maximum of more than 2,700 tons of grain per day in October, which is much higher than the purchase volume in the same period of 1952. When selling surplus grain, the peasants expressed satisfaction with the reasonable adjustment of grain prices this year and the accurate grading. Guo Dianbao, a farmer in Baijiagou Village, Er District, Faku County, sold more than 15,000 jin of soybeans, all of which were of the highest quality. Liu Yuting, a farmer in Xinchengpu Village, Yi District, sold 400 jin of soybeans first. Later, seeing that the price had increased and the grading was accurate, he immediately sold all the remaining 4,600 jin of soybeans to the state. In recent years, the people's government has vigorously supported farmers in developing production and has continuously carried out political education work for farmers, which has continuously improved farmers' patriotism. The members of the newly established agricultural production cooperative in Hongqiangzi Village, Shi District, Yi County, decided to sell their surplus grain to the state as soon as they harvested the grain. They all realized that only by actively supporting industrial construction can farmers use machines to cultivate the land sooner. They held a forum and decided on the spot to sell 6,500 jin of grain to the state at one time.
    Peasants in Heilongjiang Province are actively threshing grain and selling grain to the state at the same time. According to statistics from October 1st to 29th, the province has purchased 62,259 tons of grain, exceeding the amount of grain purchased in October last year by 26.9%. This year, the average purchase price of grain in Heilongjiang Province has increased by 13.9%, which is generally welcomed by farmers. Since the province raised grain prices on October 20, the amount of grain purchased has surged, with a total of 31,807 tons purchased in nine days. Farmers in the southern part of the province are very enthusiastic about selling grain. In Baicheng County, an average of more than 500 grain carts enter the market every day, and those sold to cooperatives account for more than 90% of the market volume. Xianghuang Village, Suihua County, launched a patriotic grain sales campaign. Many farmers loaded the grain onto carts in the threshing ground after threshing and sent it directly to the cooperative. The cooperative in the village purchases an average of more than 8,000 jin of grain every day. From the time the new grain was put on the market to November 15, it has received more than 201,000 jin of new grain. After selling surplus grain, farmers actively purchase means of production and consumer goods. Zhu Jia Village, Si District, Baicheng County, had a bumper harvest this year, and the village's grain output increased by 2.3 times compared with last year. Yao Sheng, a farmer in the village, has exchanged seven shi of new grain for a new cart. Zhang Guangqing has used 2.4 million yuan to buy a strong horse after selling grain. Many farmers are actively threshing grain and preparing to buy horses and carts to expand production.

    辽西和黑龙江两省农民踊跃售粮
    【本报讯】东北辽西、黑龙江两省农民积极出售余粮，支援国家经济建设。
    辽西省国营粮食公司十月份每天最多能购粮两千七百多吨，已大大超过一九五二年同时期的购入量。农民在出售余粮时，对今年粮价的合理调整及等级验得准确表示满意。法库县二区柏家沟村农民郭殿宝出卖了一万五千多斤大豆，质量全是上等。该县一区新城堡村刘玉庭先卖了四百斤大豆，后来看到价格上提了，等级验得又准确，立即把剩余的四千六百斤大豆全部卖给了国家。几年来，人民政府大力扶助农民发展生产，加以不断地向农民进行政治教育工作，农民的爱国主义思想不断地提高。义县十区红墙子村新建农业生产合作社的社员，刚把粮食打下来，就决定把余粮卖给国家。他们都认识到：只有积极支援工业建设，农民才能更早地使用机器种地。他们召开了座谈会，当场决定一次就卖给国家六千五百斤粮食。
    黑龙江省农民一边积极打场，一边向国家卖粮。据十月一日到二十九日统计，全省已经购入六万二千二百五十九吨粮食，超过去年十月份购粮数百分之二十六点九强。今年，黑龙江省粮食购买价格平均上提百分之十三点九，普遍受到农民的欢迎。全省从十月二十日提高粮价以后，购入粮食数量激增，九天中共购入三万一千八百零七吨。该省南部农民卖粮十分踊跃。白城县每天平均上市粮车五百多辆，向合作社出售的达上市量百分之九十以上。绥化县厢黄三村展开爱国售粮运动，很多农民打完场后，在场院内将粮食装车直接送往合作社。该村合作社平均每天都购入八千多斤粮食，从新粮上市到十一月十五日止已收进新粮二十万一千多斤。农民们卖出余粮之后，都积极购买生产资料和生活资料。白城县四区朱家村农民今年获得丰收，全村粮食产量比去年增加二点三倍，该村农民姚升已用七石新粮换进一辆新车，张广庆卖粮之后，已用二百四十万元买壮马一匹。很多农民正在积极打场，准备买马拴车，扩大生产。
