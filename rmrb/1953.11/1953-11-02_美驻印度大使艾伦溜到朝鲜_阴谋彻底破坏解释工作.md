Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 29th — U.S. Ambassador to India, George Allen, who was sent to Korea by the U.S. State Department specifically to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, has returned to New Delhi after secretly conferring with Syngman Rhee and Hamblen, the head of the U.S. "Repatriation" Group who specializes in anti-repatriation of prisoners of war. During his stay in Korea, Allen also spoke with Lieutenant General Thimayya of India, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. According to U.S. news agency reports, the focus of the talks was the issue of the explanation work being in a "stalemate." Although the U.S. side is keeping the details of Allen's activities secret, the information revealed so far is sufficient to show that Allen's series of secret talks in Korea are precisely to promote the realization of the U.S. conspiracy to detain prisoners of war. United Press International, Tokyo, November 29th, revealed: Allen, who is clearly satisfied with the standstill of the explanation work due to the obstruction of U.S. agents, will propose to the Indian Prime Minister: "If the explanation work for prisoners of war who refuse repatriation cannot continue or cannot be completed by the deadline of December 24, the explanation should not continue. The United Nations Command does not agree to extend the explanation date." "If the political conference is finally held, the United Nations will not agree to continue detaining prisoners of war. Therefore, the United Nations will insist on restoring the civilian status of the prisoners of war and releasing them on January 22." The UPI report proves that the U.S. is intensifying its efforts to direct agents to use violence such as beatings and abuse to prevent prisoners of war from accepting explanations, causing the explanation work to be stalled. On the other hand, they insist that the explanation period cannot be extended, thereby completely destroying the explanation work and violating the armistice agreement in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Any neutral country that insists on implementing the "Terms of Reference" with an impartial stance cannot tolerate the U.S.'s deliberate act of sabotaging the armistice agreement.

    美驻印度大使艾伦溜到朝鲜
    阴谋彻底破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城二十九日电】奉美国国务院之命专程前往朝鲜进行阻挠战俘遣返活动的美国驻印度大使乔治·艾伦，在和李承晚以及专门从事反战俘遣返的美方“遣返”组组长汉布伦等人秘密商谈后已返回新德里。艾伦在朝鲜停留期间还和中立国遣返委员会主席印度蒂迈雅中将进行谈话，据美方通讯社消息，谈话中心是解释工作陷于“僵局”的问题。尽管美方对艾伦的活动的内容秘而不宣，但是迄今透露出来的情况已足以说明：艾伦在朝鲜的一系列秘密会谈，正是为了促进美方扣留战俘阴谋的实现。合众社东京二十九日电透露：对于解释工作因美方特务阻挠而陷于停顿的局面显然感到满意的艾伦，将向印度总理提出：“如果对拒绝遣返的战俘的解释工作不能继续进行或不能在十二月二十四日截止日期完成的话，就不能再进行解释。联合国军司令部不同意延长解释日期。”“如果政治会议终于举行了，联合国方面是不会同意再继续拘留战俘的。因此，联合国将坚持恢复战俘的平民身分，并在一月二十二日把他们释放。”合众社的消息证明：美方正一面加紧指使特务用毒打虐杀的暴力行为来禁止战俘接受解释、使解释工作遭受停顿，另一方面又坚持解释期限不能顺延，借此来彻底破坏解释工作，破坏停战协定以达到强迫扣留战俘的目的。任何坚持以公正立场执行“职权范围”的中立国家对美方这种蓄意破坏停战协定的行动是不能容许的。
