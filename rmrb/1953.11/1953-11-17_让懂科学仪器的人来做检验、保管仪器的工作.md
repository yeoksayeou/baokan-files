    Let People Who Understand Scientific Instruments Do the Work of Inspecting and Storing Instruments
    ——Reader Visit
    Comrade Xie Xiwen of Beijing Aviation College visited the reader's letter group of this newspaper on October 25th, reflecting that some state-owned companies are not properly storing the scientific instruments they sell, causing damage to many valuable instruments.

    Comrade Xie Xiwen said: In October this year, Beijing Aviation College bought nine microscopes from Qingdao Hardware & Machinery Company, each costing over 50 million yuan. After opening the boxes, they found that the lenses of many microscopes had been rubbed and damaged, compromising their precision. One hardness testing machine was already rusted; and the brand name of one microscope had been changed (to a lower price). When asked the person in charge of the company why the instruments were in this condition, they replied, "Don't know."

    We also found the same situation when purchasing instruments from the Youth Service Department of Beijing Department Store. For example, the lenses originally had covers, but now they are wrapped in paper, and there is a lot of dust on the lenses. The lenses purchased often cannot be matched because of confused categories. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant state-owned companies selling scientific instruments should earnestly take care of the instruments; do not let people who do not understand scientific instruments do the work of inspection and storage, so as to avoid damage to the instruments and waste of state assets.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    让懂科学仪器的人来做检验、保管仪器的工作
    ——读者来访
    北京航空学院谢希文同志在十月二十五日来访本报读者来信组，反映有些国营公司不妥善保管出售的科学仪器，使许多贵重仪器受到损伤。
    谢希文同志说：今年十月，北京航空学院从青岛五金机械公司买来九架显微镜，每架五千余万元，打开装箱后，发现有许多架显微镜的镜头被磨擦了，损坏了精密的程度。其中有一架硬度试验机已经生了锈；还有一架显微镜的厂牌更换了（价低一些），问该公司的负责人为什么把仪器弄成这个样子，他们回答：“不知道。”
    我们在北京百货公司青年服务部购买仪器，也发现同样的情形，譬如镜头原来是有套子的，现在变成用纸包扎了，镜头上尘土很多。买到的镜头常常因类别混乱，买了回去配不上。因此，我建议有关出售科学仪器的国营公司，应对仪器切实加以保管；别让不懂科学仪器的人作检验保管等工作，免得仪器损伤，浪费国家的资财。
