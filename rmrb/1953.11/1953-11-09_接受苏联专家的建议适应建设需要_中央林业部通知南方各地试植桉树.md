Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts and to adapt to construction needs, the Central Forestry Ministry has notified southern regions to pilot planting eucalyptus trees.

Following an inspection of southern forest areas in China, Soviet forestry expert Nenarokomov submitted a proposal to the Central People's Government Forestry Ministry regarding the large-scale development of eucalyptus trees. The proposal stated: Eucalyptus (also known as gum tree) is an extremely useful and valuable tree species, very suitable for planting in various parts of southern China. Eucalyptus wood is strong and sturdy, and can be used as utility poles, railway sleepers, beams, mine props, bridges, and planks. Because of its high resistance to decay, it is even more suitable for building water conservancy projects. Railway sleepers made of eucalyptus wood are more durable than other woods even without preservative treatment. Eucalyptus leaves can be processed to extract oil for use in medicine and the fragrance industry. Eucalyptus trees also make excellent windbreaks for orange groves and tea plantations. Eucalyptus trees have another excellent characteristic: after being cut down, they will sprout again from the rootstock, allowing for forest regeneration. They also grow quickly and can accumulate a large amount of material in a short time, playing a significant role in timber reproduction. Therefore, it is recommended that eucalyptus trees be planted on a large scale in southern regions with suitable natural conditions.

Based on the Soviet experts' suggestion, the Central Forestry Ministry has telegraphed the forestry departments of major administrative regions and provinces in Central South, East China, and Southwest China, instructing them to select areas with favorable climates and soil conditions, and where the masses have experience in afforestation, to pilot the promotion and planting of eucalyptus trees starting in 1954. All regions are actively preparing after receiving the notification. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has prepared to build eucalyptus forests in Gejiu, Kunming, and the Nanpan River area.

Note: Eucalyptus is a tropical and subtropical economic forest tree species. Lemon eucalyptus planted in Fuzhou for 37 years can reach a height of 36.5 meters with a diameter at breast height of 68 centimeters; large-leaved eucalyptus planted for 36 years can reach a height of 30 meters with a diameter at breast height of 30 centimeters. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, southeastern Xikang, southwestern Sichuan, southern Hunan, southern Jiangxi, central and southern Fujian, as well as Taiwan and Hainan in China are all suitable for planting. Soviet forest scientists, using the biological science principles of Michurin and Lysenko, have transplanted eucalyptus from the tropics to colder regions, cultivated many new varieties, and expanded the cultivation area of eucalyptus.

    接受苏联专家的建议适应建设需要
    中央林业部通知南方各地试植桉树
    中央人民政府林业部根据苏联专家的建议，通知南方各省试点推广种植桉树。
    苏联林业专家聂纳洛阔莫夫在察看了我国南方林区以后，向中央人民政府林业部提出一项关于大量发展桉树的建议。建议书中指出：桉树（有加利树）是极有用而珍贵的树种，很适宜在中国南方各地种植。桉树的木材坚固而结实，可用作电杆、枕木、栋梁、矿柱、桥梁和木板等，因其抗腐性很强，更适宜于建筑水利工程。桉材制成的枕木，不经防腐处理也比其他木材经久耐用。桉树的树叶可加工提油供医药和香料工业上使用。桉树对于橘林和茶园更是一种优美的防风林。桉树并具有一种优良的特点，砍伐后又会由根株萌芽，使林木更新，而且生长迅速，很快地就可以积蓄起很多材料，对木材再生产起很大作用。因此，建议在南方自然条件适宜的地区，大量扩展桉树的栽植。
    中央林业部根据苏联专家的建议，已电知中南、华东、西南各大区、省林业主管部门，从一九五四年起，选择气候、土质良好，群众有造林经验地区，试点推广种植桉树。各地接通知后都在积极准备。云南省农林厅已准备在个旧、昆明及南盘江等地营造桉林。
    按：桉树是热带和亚热带经济林木树种，在福州市种植的三十七年的柠檬桉高达三十六公尺半，胸高直径六十八公分；三十六年的大叶桉高达三十公尺，胸高直径三十公分。我国的广东、广西、云南、西康东南部，四川西南部、湖南南部、江西南部、福建中南部以及台湾、海南等地都适宜种植。苏联的森林科学家们，运用米丘林、李森科的生物科学原理，已把桉树从热带移植到较寒冷的地区，培养出许多新的品种，扩大了桉树的栽培领域。
