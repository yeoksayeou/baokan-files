Xinhua News Agency report: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on the 28th and 29th of October to discuss the so-called "impartial investigation of accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by United Nations forces."

The British representative, Lloyd, spoke at the morning session. He opposed the Soviet proposal, which suggested that the General Assembly call upon all countries that have not acceded to or ratified the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons to accede to or ratify the protocol.

Representatives from Australia, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the Union of South Africa also repeated the slander of the United States representative against the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union. They followed the United States in claiming that the American pilots were forced to confess to the United States' use of bacteriological warfare.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, David, said that the United States delegation put the so-called "impartial investigation of accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by United Nations forces" on the agenda in order to use the United Nations discussion for propaganda purposes, to confuse world public opinion which is extremely angry about the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States army in Korea.

David said that the United States representative insisted that the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea dared not allow others to impartially investigate the bacteriological warfare in Korea, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Authoritative international organizations, such as the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the International Scientific Commission for Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, and other organizations, have concluded after investigation that the accusations of the United States army conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of China and Korea are based on irrefutable facts. The written confessions of American pilots captured in Korea also confirmed that the United States army used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. The United States' refusal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations to participate in the discussion of this issue proves that it is the United States, not the government of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, that is afraid of impartial investigation.

David said that world public opinion hopes that the United Nations General Assembly will announce the prohibition of bacteriological weapons and call on countries that have not yet acceded to or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol to do so as soon as possible. The prohibition of bacteriological weapons is in line with the wishes of all civilized people. Therefore, the Czechoslovak delegation supports the Soviet proposal.

The Canadian representative said that the Geneva Protocol was and is a valuable document. He requested that the Soviet proposal be submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for consideration. The New Zealand representative supported the Canadian representative's suggestion.

The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, pointed out that the United States delegation is not interested in an impartial investigation of the accusations regarding the United States' use of bacteriological weapons. The attitude taken by the United States delegation at the Seventh General Assembly can illustrate the following point: it obstructs the participation of Chinese and Korean representatives in the General Assembly, and therefore obstructs them from presenting evidence to the General Assembly of the United States army's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

Katz-Suchy pointed out that the United States military authorities forced the American air force personnel who had been repatriated to "overturn" their confessions in Korea acknowledging the United States' use of bacteriological weapons. The United States military authorities' method of getting them to recant was a special set of methods of applying pressure, which in the United States is called "brainwashing."

Katz-Suchy supported the Soviet proposal, pointing out that the adoption of this proposal could ease international tensions and strengthen international peace and security.

Before the adjournment of the meeting, the delegations of the United Kingdom, Canada, Colombia, New Zealand, and France jointly submitted a proposal suggesting that the General Assembly submit the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for consideration.

At the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the morning of October 29, the French representative, Aubépin, said that his country had joined the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of Bacteriological Weapons. As a representative of such a country, he "would also be very willing to support the Soviet proposal" and would like to see all countries that have not joined this protocol join it. However, he contradicted himself by saying that he could not do so at present in the Political Committee and should follow the suggestion of the joint proposal of the United Kingdom, Canada, Colombia, New Zealand, and France to refer the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for consideration.

The Belarusian representative, Kiselev, spoke, pointing out that the United States delegation had obstructed a truly impartial investigation of the bacteriological warfare conducted by the United Nations forces in North Korea and China. The United States delegation and other delegations that supported it tried their best to oppose inviting representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussions of the Political Committee, although these two countries are directly related to the investigation of this issue. Now, this issue has been brought up again at the General Assembly and discussed without the participation of representatives from Korea and China, in order to confuse world public opinion on the United States army's bacteriological warfare. It is worth noting that the resolution forcibly passed by the United States delegation at the Seventh General Assembly did not mention at all that it should call on all countries, including the United States, that have not joined or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol to join or ratify the protocol. There is a reason for this. Among the major countries in the world, only Japan and the United States have not ratified this protocol, and it is these two countries that first used bacteriological weapons.

The fact that forty-eight countries have signed the Geneva Protocol is enough to prove how important this international agreement is and also proves the great significance of the diplomatic, legal, and moral obligations arising from this agreement.

Kiselev said that for the benefit of international peace and security, the delegation of the Belarusian Republic fully supports the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation, calling on all countries that have not yet acceded to or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol to accede to or ratify the protocol as soon as possible.

Kiselev concluded by saying that the General Assembly must meet the demands of all progressive mankind and announce the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, including bacteriological weapons.

### 联大政委会继续讨论美国企图抵赖进行细菌战的提案  捷、波、白俄罗斯代表发言支持苏联提案

    联大政委会继续讨论美国企图抵赖进行细菌战的提案
    捷、波、白俄罗斯代表发言支持苏联提案
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二十八日和二十九日上午继续举行会议，继续讨论所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”。
    英国代表劳埃德在上午会议上发言。他反对苏联提案。苏联提案建议大会号召一切没有参加或没有批准关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家，参加或批准这一议定书。
    澳大利亚、荷兰、巴西及南非联邦的代表，也重复美国代表对中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联的诽谤。他们跟在美国后面，硬说美国飞行人员是被迫供认美国进行细菌战的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维发言说：美国代表团把所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”列入议程，就是为了利用联合国的讨论进行宣传，为了迷惑对美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器极为愤怒的世界舆论。
    戴维说，美国代表硬说中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不敢让别人公正地调查在朝鲜进行细菌战的情况，这是与事实完全不符的。权威的国际组织，如国际民主法律工作者协会、调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实的国际科学委员会和其他组织，在调查后都已得到这样的结论：控告美国军队对中朝人民进行细菌战，是有无可争辩的事实作根据的。在朝鲜被俘的美国飞行人员的书面供词，也证实美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用了细菌武器。美国拒绝邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表到联合国来参加这个问题的讨论，这就证明害怕进行公正调查的是美国，而不是中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。
    戴维说，世界舆论希望联合国大会宣布禁止细菌武器，并号召还没有参加或批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家尽快地参加或批准这一议定书。禁止细菌武器是符合所有文明人类的愿望的，因此，捷克斯洛伐克代表团支持苏联提案。
    加拿大代表说：日内瓦议定书过去和现在都是一个很有价值的文件。他要求把苏联提案提交联合国裁减军备委员会审议。新西兰代表支持加拿大代表的建议。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希指出：美国代表团对于公正调查关于美国使用细菌武器的控诉并不感兴趣。美国代表团在第七届大会上所采取的态度，可以说明下面一点：它阻挠中国和朝鲜代表参加大会，因此也就是阻挠他们向大会提出美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的证据。
    卡茨—苏希指出，美国军事当局强迫已遣返回国的美国空军人员“推翻”他们在朝鲜承认美国使用细菌武器的供词。美国军事当局使他们翻供的办法是一整套施加压力的特别办法，这在美国称之为“洗脑筋”。
    卡茨—苏希支持苏联提案，指出通过这个提案，就可以缓和国际紧张局势，加强国际和平与安全。
    英国、加拿大、哥伦比亚、新西兰和法国代表团在会议休会前，联合提出一个提案，建议大会把苏联提案提交联合国裁减军备委员会审议。
    在联合国大会政治委员会十月二十九日上午的会议上，法国代表奥培诺说，他本国已经参加了关于禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，作为这样一个国家的代表，“也很愿意支持苏联的提案”，并愿看到所有不曾参加这个议定书的国家都参加这个议定书。然而，他又自相矛盾地说，他目前在政治委员会里不能这样做，应该按照英国、加拿大、哥伦比亚、新西兰和法国联合提案的建议，把苏联提案转交给联合国裁减军备委员会审议。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫发言，指出美国代表团曾阻挠对联合国军队在北朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的事情进行真正公正的调查。美国代表团以及其他支持它的代表团竭力反对邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加政治委员会的讨论，虽然这两个国家与调查这个问题有直接的关系。现在，这个问题又在大会上提出来，在没有朝鲜和中国代表参加的情况下讨论，以迷惑世界舆论对美国军队进行细菌战的看法。值得注意的是，美国代表团强使第七届大会通过的决议完全没有提到应该号召一切没有参加或批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家，包括美国在内，参加或批准这个议定书。这是有其原由的。在世界各大国当中，只有日本和美国没有批准这个议定书，也正是这两个国家首先使用了细菌武器。
    在日内瓦议定书上签字的有四十八个国家，这个事实就足以证明这个国际协议是多么重要，也证明了根据这个协议而产生的外交上、法律上和道义上的义务所具有的重大意义。
    基谢列夫说，白俄罗斯共和国代表团为了国际和平与安全的利益，完全支持苏联代表团提出的提案，号召一切还没有参加或批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家尽快参加或批准这个议定书。
    基谢列夫最后说，大会必须满足全体进步人类的要求，宣布禁止大规模毁灭性武器，包括细菌武器。
