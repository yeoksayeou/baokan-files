    How Beijing Hospitals Overcome Chaos
    Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Public Health Bureau

    The "supply falling short of demand" phenomenon in urban medical work has been a serious problem for several years.
    The overcrowding in Beijing hospitals is particularly severe. The long-term failure to solve this problem has led to chaos in hospital work, increasing the suffering of patients. The most prominent manifestation of hospital chaos is what people often call "three longs and one short" (i.e., long waiting times for registration, consultation, payment and medicine collection, and short consultation times), and excessively long appointment times. As a result, patients often cannot get timely medical treatment or even easily get a chance to see a doctor.
    Investigative materials show that the "three longs and one short" situation is serious: patients spend an average of 40 minutes registering, an average of 2 hours waiting for consultation, and an average of 37 minutes paying and collecting medicine. However, the actual consultation time is as short as 3 minutes, with a maximum of 10 minutes. Patients are dissatisfied with this, either saying "can't afford the time" or blaming doctors for "perfunctory diagnosis."
    Because the time between making an appointment and seeing a doctor is too long, the phenomenon of patients being unable to see a doctor is quite common. According to a survey of three hospitals, the time from appointment registration to seeing a doctor for first-time patients is 10 to 14 days for internal medicine, 3 to 15 days for obstetrics and gynecology (with some up to one and a half months), and generally several days for surgery. Patients react by saying: major illnesses become more serious as they wait, and minor illnesses get better after waiting a while.
    Hospital staff are tense and rushed in the situation of "many patients, chaotic work," unable to cope, often unable to get off work on time, and their work morale is also affected.
    The existence of the above-mentioned serious situation is not only detrimental to patients but also detrimental to work, and must be changed. Therefore, rectifying hospital work and overcoming chaos has become an urgent and important task in Beijing's health work.
    We believe that in rectifying hospital work, we should first concentrate our efforts on rectifying outpatient work. Because outpatient work is the busiest, has the most contact with patients, and has the most problems. By rectifying outpatient work, it will be easier to improve inpatient work. Therefore, the Beijing Public Health Bureau's rectification of hospital work in the third quarter focused on rectifying outpatient services. By the beginning of October, combined with the development of the increased production and conservation campaign, the rectification of hospital work was further deepened under the slogan of "convenient for patients, tapping potential, and improving work efficiency." As a result, the chaos in medical treatment began to be overcome.
    In the early stage of rectification, the responsible cadres of various hospitals used the method of personally going to the site and tracking patients to understand how much time patients needed from queuing up for registration to leaving the hospital; and convened various symposiums with representatives of entrusted units, police station personnel, and patient representatives to find out the root causes of the chaos. After investigation, the following problems were found in the work:
    1. Complicated procedures and excessive non-technical operations by doctors. It is understood that when a patient enters the hospital gate, they have to go through at least six procedures and queue three times from registration, waiting for consultation, treatment to pricing, payment, and medicine collection. If they need to transfer to another department for treatment, or need to have laboratory tests or fluoroscopy (or X-rays), there can be as many as seventeen procedures. A first-time patient often runs around confused to complete the procedures. As for doctors, in addition to diagnosing illnesses, they also have to fill out laboratory test forms, treatment orders, certificates, diagnostic reports, statistical cards, infectious disease reports, and sometimes also arrange hospital beds for patients, which affects the improvement of work efficiency.
    2. The system itself has problems, and there are also shortcomings in the implementation of the system. For example, some hospitals stipulate that outpatient treatment and ward rounds are at the same time, resulting in delays in outpatient treatment for the sake of ward rounds, causing outpatient patients to wait for a long time. Some hospitals only allow registration in the morning, so if patients come in the afternoon, they can only register the next day, which increases the patient's travel time. Some patients only come to the hospital for injections, but because there are too many procedures, it takes an hour to get an injection. Appointment registration for outpatient services is originally an advanced Soviet system, but its implementation is too mechanical and has not achieved the desired results. For example, many patients who make appointments for follow-up visits often fail to keep their appointments (accounting for more than 10% of outpatient patients), but the staff responsible for registration still see patients according to the registration order, resulting in the phenomenon of those who make appointments for follow-up visits not coming, and those who make appointments for initial visits not being seen.
    3. Inappropriate labor organization and deployment, and insufficient work coordination. For example, some hospitals have more internal medicine patients and fewer pediatric patients, so internal medicine is too busy, and pediatrics is relatively idle; but the hospital does not think of deploying the pediatric medical force to support internal medicine. In the same obstetrics and gynecology department, gynecologists are busier, and obstetricians are more idle, and there is no deployment of obstetricians to help gynecologists. Also, because nurses do not do enough preparation work before outpatient services, or because there are too few registration windows and the registration speed is slow, there is a phenomenon of doctors "idling." The connection between the inpatient department and the wards, and between hospitals is also insufficient. Each hospital does not know much about the bed situation in its own hospital and other hospitals, so the utilization rate of beds cannot be improved.
    4. There are many chronic patients, which have not been studied and resolved as a special problem. According to a survey by the Beijing Fifth Municipal Hospital, chronic patients account for 50% of internal medicine outpatient patients, and the situation is roughly the same in other hospitals. The surgical departments of various hospitals have the most chronic disease patients with anal fistula, hemorrhoids, and arthritis, and the obstetrics and gynecology departments have the most chronic disease patients with infertility, adnexitis, etc. These chronic patients cannot be cured for a long time, which makes the outpatient workload accumulate more and more, and the number of follow-up patients is also constantly increasing. For example, in the internal medicine department of the Beijing Third Municipal Hospital, the number of follow-up patients once exceeded the number of initial visits by ten times. This not only reduces the treatment opportunities for first-time patients, but even delays minor surgeries for surgical and obstetrics and gynecology patients for a long time.
    In response to the above situation, we put forward the slogan of "investigating, researching, and improving at the same time," led by leaders, mobilized the masses, and concentrated everyone's wisdom to study ways to improve the work. These methods can be summarized as follows:
    1. In order to simplify the procedures, the work of pricing, charging, and dispensing medicines is combined (some work together, some are merged into one organization), which reduces the time for patients to complete three procedures and queue twice. In addition, we have implemented a mixed prescription system (i.e., in addition to prescribing medicine, if the patient needs laboratory tests or fluoroscopy, they are all written on the prescription at the same time). The patient can go directly to the laboratory, fluoroscopy, and medicine collection with the mixed prescription, avoiding multiple trips. For patients who only come to the hospital for injections, we have adopted the method of issuing continuous injection certificates. In this way, the patient only completes one payment procedure and can hold the certificate to the injection room for injections until all the injections are completed.
    2. In order to shorten the registration time, we have added registration windows and adopted the method of registering by department. Tongren Hospital also created a mobile registration method, that is, registration staff go to the patient to register. This changed the phenomenon of patients queuing up for registration, and work efficiency doubled.
    3. In order to enable first-time patients to see a doctor on the same day, according to the situation that patients often fail to keep their appointments, we have adopted the method of using first-time patients to fill the vacancies of follow-up patients. We also put forward the slogan of "increasing first visits and reducing follow-up visits," and based on the number of first and follow-up visits, we appropriately lengthened the treatment interval for chronic patients in follow-up visits (appropriately lengthening the treatment interval for chronic patients has little impact on their condition) to free up time and increase the treatment opportunities for first-time patients.
    4. For chronic patients, we have adopted a centralized treatment method. Because there are the most internal medicine chronic patients and their conditions are also the most complicated, we started with internal medicine, that is, selected patients with similar diseases (also taking into account the severity of the condition), and concentrated them at the same time for diagnosis and treatment. Before diagnosis and treatment, we first answered the questions raised by the patients and informed them of the precautions during convalescence. This saves time and effort, and patients are also very satisfied. The surgical department of Beijing Fifth Municipal Hospital has also implemented centralized treatment for patients with chronic arthritis, expanding the scope of centralized treatment. In the past, doctors often delayed the treatment of other patients because they had to explain to patients (especially chronic patients) during diagnosis and treatment. If they did not explain or explained less, the patients would not be satisfied. Since the implementation of centralized treatment, this long-unresolved problem has been initially resolved.
    5. Appropriately adjust the labor organization and strengthen the connection between departments. For example, in the Beijing Third Municipal Hospital, due to the adjustment of the labor organization, three consultation stations were added, and personnel who can perform surgery in each department were concentrated and used in a unified manner, and the previously accumulated minor surgeries were all handled. The inpatient department and the wards of each hospital have also established a liaison system, which fully leverages the potential of the beds. In the past, many non-technical operations performed by doctors have been handed over to nurses as much as possible, which has increased the doctor's technical operation time.
    In addition to the above, the regulations for outpatient treatment and ward rounds at the same time have been changed, the registration time has been extended, and nurses have strengthened the preparation work before the start of outpatient services. The pharmacy has prepared different powders and solutions according to commonly used prescriptions and dispensed them separately, so the dispensing of medicines is also faster than before.
    Thanks to the above-mentioned methods, hospital work has been greatly improved, and the chaos has been greatly overcome:
    1. First-time appointment patients basically have the opportunity to see a doctor on the same day. In some hospitals, although there are many internal medicine patients, they can still enable patients to see a doctor within two days, changing the situation where it took ten to fourteen days to see a doctor in the past. At present, the ratio of first-time and follow-up patients in various hospitals has mostly reached one to three, and individual departments have reached one to one.
    2. The phenomenon of "three longs and one short" has been changed to a certain extent. For example, patients waiting for registration used to take an average of 40 minutes, but now it has been reduced to 10 minutes, and some hospitals have already achieved "register as soon as you arrive." It used to take a patient up to three and a half hours to see a doctor, but now it takes no more than one hour; patients who only come to the hospital for injections used to spend up to one hour for an injection, but now it only takes five or six minutes.
    3. The potential has been generally tapped. For example, the daily outpatient quota of the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Beijing Third Municipal Hospital has increased from 60 to 110; the daily outpatient quota of the Beijing Fifth Municipal Hospital has increased by 100; the Beijing Seventh Municipal Hospital has increased by 50; and the Beijing Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital has increased by 200 per week. Tongren Hospital used to have more than 900 outpatient patients every day, and the morning outpatient service sometimes had to be finished by 1:30 in the afternoon; now it can not only see 1,320 outpatient patients every day, but also get off work on time. Other hospitals, such as Beijing Second Municipal Hospital, Sixth Municipal Hospital, May Fourth Hospital, and Otolaryngology Hospital, have also tapped their potential. In addition, 75 new beds have been added throughout the city without adding staff or increasing labor intensity. If these new beds accommodate two patients per bed per month, they can accommodate 1,800 more patients per year.
    4. The utilization rate of beds has been improved. In the past, the average utilization rate of beds was 82%, but now it has increased to 92.5% (excluding infectious disease hospitals). For example, the bed utilization rate of the Beijing Sixth Municipal Hospital has increased from 70% to 91.3%, and the Beijing Third Municipal Hospital and Tongren Hospital have increased by 10% compared with the past. In the past, many hospitals were afraid of trouble and were unwilling to admit more patients, but now they are competing to admit patients.
    The achievements made since the rectification of outpatient work have increased the work confidence of hospital staff. In the past, due to the chaos and hard work, and many criticisms from the outside, the work confidence of hospital staff was greatly affected. Now that the work has been improved, it is no longer as chaotic as in the past, and what is received is not criticism but praise. The staff feel that they have confidence and also have spare energy; therefore, recently, various hospitals have signed medical contracts with several industrial and mining enterprises with a total of more than 200,000 workers. In the past, everyone was afraid of more work, but now they are afraid of less work, which is a significant change.
    Because the situation of "three longs and one short" has been changed, a lot of precious time has been saved for the masses. If this time is used for production, the role of this improvement in ensuring production is very amazing. Municipal medical institutions have an average of 13,000 outpatient visits per day. If each person saves an average of two hours, a total of 26,000 hours are saved per day, which is equivalent to 3,250 working days. This is not easy to see, but it is a great achievement.
    The masses have responded very well to this rectification of hospital work. The prestige of municipal medical institutions has been improved among the masses, and the relationship with the masses has also been closer. In particular, the leading cadres of most hospitals have enriched their experience in managing urban hospitals in the process of improving their work, changed the situation of being busy with trivial matters for many years, and began to turn to planned management of hospital work. The results of this improvement work have further laid a good foundation for doing a good job in planned management.
    The key to the success of this rectification of hospital work is to overcome "conservative thinking." In the past, medical workers always believed that because people's living standards are constantly improving and medical requirements are also constantly increasing, but due to the lack of medical institutions, a situation of medical supply falling short of demand has been formed. Therefore, the chaos in urban hospitals is inevitable. Starting from this point of view, it is believed that the "supply falling short of demand" and chaos in medical treatment cannot be overcome in the short term unless more medical institutions are added until they can meet the needs of the people. Therefore, they simply hope that more medical institutions can be added in the future, sit and wait for the difficulties to be solved in the future, and do not actively try to improve the work.
    Facts have proved that the difficulties brought to work by the insufficient medical institutions are very great, so it is necessary to gradually add medical institutions to appropriately meet the needs of the people; however, we should never regard the insufficient medical institutions as the only and only reason for the chaos in medical treatment. Because in this way, we will inevitably ignore or weaken our subjective efforts and fail to bravely overcome difficulties. We believe that precisely because medical institutions are insufficient, we should strengthen subjective efforts, overcome difficulties, and break the chaotic situation. The achievements made in this improvement work are an indisputable proof. This fact has taught us that conservative thinking is a stumbling block to the progress of work, and we must overcome conservative thinking for work to continue to move forward.

    北京市医院是怎样克服着忙乱现象的
    北京市公共卫生局副局长　张文奇
    城市医疗工作中的“供不应求”现象，几年以来，始终是一个严重问题。
    北京市各医院的拥挤情况特别严重。这个问题长期未能解决，造成了医院工作中的忙乱现象，增加了病人的痛苦。医院忙乱现象的突出表现是人们常说的“三长一短”（即挂号、候诊、交费取药的时间长，诊病的时间短），和预约时间的太久，因而病人往往有病不能及时医好，甚至不容易得到看病的机会。
    调查材料说明，“三长一短”的情况是严重的：病人挂号平均需四十分钟，候诊平均需二小时，交费取药平均需三十七分钟，但临到诊病，则短至三分钟，最多十分钟。病人对此不满，不是说“赔不起工夫”，就是责怪医生“诊病草率”。
    因为从预约挂号到看病的时间相距太久，病人看不上病的现象相当普遍。根据对三个医院的调查，初诊病人从预约挂号到看病，内科需十至十四天，妇产科需三至十五天（有多至一个半月的），外科一般也需要几天的时间。病人反应：大病越等越重，小病等一等也就好了。
    医院工作人员在“病人多，工作乱”的情况下，工作紧张、忙迫，应付不暇，经常不能按时下班，工作情绪也很受影响。
    上述严重情况的存在，不仅对病人不利，对工作也是不利的，必须努力加以改变；因此整顿医院工作，克服忙乱现象，成了北京市卫生工作中急不容缓的重要任务。
    我们认为，整顿医院工作，首先应该集中力量整顿门诊工作。因为门诊工作最为繁忙，接触病人最多，存在的问题也最多。整顿了门诊工作，也就比较容易地改善病房工作。因此北京市公共卫生局第三季度的整顿医院工作，就以整顿门诊为中心开展起来。到十月初，又结合开展增产节约运动，在
  “便利病人，挖掘潜力，提高工作效率”的口号下，把整顿医院的工作又深入了一步。这样，医疗上的忙乱现象，开始克服。
    整顿初期，各医院的负责干部用亲到现场、跟踪病人的办法，了解病人从排队挂号到离开医院究竟需要多少时间；并召集嘱托单位的人员、派出所的人员以及病人代表举行各种座谈会，找寻造成忙乱现象的症结所在。经过调查，发现工作上有以下几个问题：
    一、手续繁杂，医生非技术性的操作过多。据了解，一般病人进入医院大门，从挂号、候诊、治疗到划价、交费、取药……最少要办六道手续，排三次队；如果需要转科治疗，需要化验、透视（或照爱克斯光像），则手续有多至十七道的。一个初诊病人，为了办手续，往往东跑西奔，弄得不知所以。至于医生，除诊病外，还要填写化验单，处置单，证明书，诊断书，统计卡片，传染病报告，有时还要给病人接洽病床等等，因而也影响了工作效率的提高。
    二、制度本身有毛病，执行制度也有缺点。例如，有的医院把门诊治疗和病房巡诊，规定在同一时间，结果为了病房巡诊就误了门诊治疗，致使门诊病人久候。有的医院只规定上午挂号，如果下午来了病人，就只能等到第二天挂号，增加了病人的往返时间。有些病人，只是到医院打针，因为手续太多，打一次针也要费一小时的工夫。预约门诊挂号，本来是苏联的先进制度，但在执行时过于机械，没有收到应有效果。例如，不少预约复诊病人，往往失约（约占门诊病人百分之十以上），而负责挂号工作的人员，仍是按照挂号顺序看病，结果造成了复诊预约者不来，初诊预约者不看的现象。
    三、劳动组织调配不当，工作配合不够。例如，有的医院内科病人多，小儿科病人少，内科忙不完，小儿科较清闲；但医院没有想法调配小儿科的医疗力量，去支援内科。在同一个妇产科，妇科医生较忙，产科医生较闲，也没有调配产科医生的力量，去帮助妇科医生工作。还有，因为护士们在门诊前的准备工作做得不够，或由于挂号的窗口少，挂号的速度慢，而发生医生“窝工”的现象。住院处和病房之间、医院和医院之间的联系也不够，每个医院都不太了解本院病床和其他医院的病床情况，致使病床的使用率无法提高。
    四、慢性病人多，没有被当作一个特殊的问题去研究解决。据北京市立第五医院调查，慢性病人占内科门诊病人百分之五十，其他医院也大致相同。各医院的外科以肛瘘、痔核、关节炎等慢性病患者为最多，妇产科以不妊症、附属器炎等慢性病患者为最多。这些慢性病人，久治不愈，使门诊工作量愈积愈多，而复诊病人的数字也在不断增加。如北京市立第三医院内科，有一个时期的复诊病人曾多于初诊病人十倍。这不仅减少了初诊病人的治疗机会，甚至使外科和妇产科病人的小手术也长期拖延着不能施行。
    针对以上情况，我们提出了“边调查，边研究，边改进”的口号，由领导人员带头，发动群众，集中大家智慧，研究了改进工作的办法。这些办法归纳起来有如下几点：
    一、为了简化手续，把划价、收费、取药等几个部分的工作合在一起（有的合署办公，有的并为一个机构），这样就使病人减少了办三道手续和排两次队的时间。此外，我们实行了混合处方制
  （即处方上除开药外，如病人需要化验或透视时，都一齐写在处方上），病人拿着混合处方，就可以直接去化验、透视、取药，免得多次往返。对于只来病院打针的病人，则采取了发给连续注射证的办法。这样，病人只办一次交费手续，即可持证到注射室打针，直到全部打完为止。
    二、为了缩短挂号时间，增设了挂号窗口，采取了分科挂号的办法。同仁医院并创造了一种流动挂号的方式，即挂号工作人员，亲自到病人面前去挂号。如此改变了病人排队挂号的现象，工作效率提高了一倍。
    三、为了使初诊病人能在当日看病，根据复诊预约病人常常失约的情况，采用了以初诊病人来递补复诊病人缺额的办法。我们并提出“增多初诊、压缩复诊”的口号，依据初复诊病人的多少，把复诊中慢性病人的治疗间隔适当地拉长（慢性病人的治疗间隔适当拉长，对其病情影响不大），以便空出时间，增多初诊病人的治疗机会。
    四、对于慢性病人，采取了集中治疗的办法。因为内科慢性病人最多，病情也最复杂，所以先从内科开始，即选择同类疾病（还要照顾病情的程度）的病人，分批集中在同一时间里，进行诊治。诊治前先解答病人提出的问题，并告以疗养时应注意的事项。这样既省时又省事，病人也很满意。北京市立第五医院外科，对慢性关节炎患者，也实行了集中治疗，扩大了集中治疗的范围。过去，医生在诊疗中常因为对病人作解释工作（特别是对慢性病人）而耽误对其他病人的治疗，不解释或少解释则病人又不满意；自实行集中治疗后，这一长期未得到解决的问题，已初步得到解决。
    五、适当调整劳动组织，密切各科间的联系。如北京市立第三医院，由于调整了劳动组织，增加了三个诊察台，并集中各科能作手术的人员，统一使用，把过去积压的小手术，都作了处置。各医院住院处和病房也建立了联系制度，这样便充分地发挥了病床的潜力。过去医生担任的许多非技术性操作，已尽可能交由护士去作，增加了医生的技术操作时间。
    除上所述，还改变了门诊治疗和巡查病房同时并进的规定，延长了挂号时间，加强了护士在开诊前的准备工作。药房根据一般常用的处方，配成了不同的粉剂和水剂，作了分装，因而发药也较前迅速了。
    由于采取了以上的种种办法，医院工作已大有改进，因而忙乱现象也大大克服：
    一、初诊预约病人，基本上得到了当日看病的机会。有的医院内科，虽然病人很多，但也能够使病人在两天以内看病，改变了过去十至十四天才能看病的情况。目前，各医院初诊和复诊病人的比例，多数已达到一比三，个别的科已达到一比一。
    二、“三长一短”的现象，有了一定程度的改变。如病人等候挂号，过去平均需四十分钟，现在已减到十分钟，还有些医院已作到“随到随挂号”的地步。一个病人看一次病，过去最多用三小时半的时间，现在最多不超过一小时；只来医院打针的病人，过去打一次针最多要花费一小时，现在只用五、六分钟就够了。
    三、普遍地发挥了潜力。如北京市立第三医院妇产科，每日门诊病人定额已从六十人增加到一百一十人；北京市立第五医院每日门诊病人定额增加了一百人；北京市立第七医院增加了五十人；北京市立结核病防治院每周增加了二百人。同仁医院过去每日门诊九百多人，上午的门诊，有时要到下午一点半钟才能看完；现在不仅每日能看门诊病人一千三百二十人，而且能按时下班了。其他如北京市立第二医院、第六医院、五四医院、耳鼻咽喉医院等医院也都发挥了潜在力量。此外，在不增添工作人员、不增加劳动强度的原则下，全市还新增了病床七十五张。这些新增病床，如果每月每床收容两个病人，全年即可增收病人一千八百名。
    四、提高了病床的使用率。过去病床的使用率平均为百分之八十二，现已提高到百分之九十二点五（传染病院除外）。如北京市立第六医院的病床使用率，由原来的百分之七十，提高到百分之九十一点三，北京市立第三医院、同仁医院等医院，均较过去提高了百分之十。过去许多医院怕麻烦，不愿多收留病人，现在都争着收留病人了。
    整顿门诊工作以来所获得的成绩，使医院工作人员提高了工作信心。过去由于忙乱不堪，工作吃力，外界责难较多，医院工作人员的工作信心受了不小影响。现在工作改进了，再不像过去那样忙乱了，受到的不是责难而是表扬了，工作人员觉得有了信心，也有了余力；因此，最近各医院又和共有二十多万工人的若干工矿企业单位，订立了医疗合同。过去大家都怕工作多，现在是怕工作少，这是一个显著的转变。
    因为改变了“三长一短”的状况，节省了群众的许多宝贵光阴。如果把这些光阴用到生产上，则此次工作的改进，对于保证生产所起的作用，是十分惊人的。市立各医疗机构，每日平均门诊一万三千人次，每人平均按节省两小时计算，则每日共省二万六千小时，等于三千二百五十个劳动日。这一点是不容易看得见的，但却是一个极大的成绩。
    此次整顿医院工作，广大群众反应很好。市立医疗机构在群众中的威信提高了，和群众之间的关系也密切了。特别是多数医院的领导干部，在这次改进工作的过程中，丰富了管理城市医院的经验，改变了过去多年忙于琐碎事务的状况，开始转向对医院工作的有计划的管理。而此次改进工作的结果，也进一步为作好有计划的管理奠定了良好的基础。
    此次整顿医院工作所以获得成功，关键是克服了“保守思想”。过去医务工作者总认为由于人民生活水平不断提高，医疗要求也不断增长，但因医疗机构的不足，形成了医疗上的供不应求现象，因而城市医院的忙乱现象是不可避免的。并从这一观点出发，认为医疗上的“供不应求”和忙乱现象，不是短期内能够克服的，除非多多增添医疗机构，直至能够满足人民需要。因而单纯希望将来能增设医疗机构，坐待困难的来日解决，而不积极地设法改进工作。
    事实证明，因医疗机构不敷需要，给工作带来的困难是很大的，因而需要逐步增设医疗机构，以适当满足人民的要求；但是，决不应把医疗机构不敷需要看成是形成医疗上忙乱现象的唯一无二的原因。因为这样一来，就必然忽视或减弱自己的主观努力，不能勇敢地克服困难。我们认为，正是因为医疗机构不敷需要，就更应当加强主观努力，克服困难，打破忙乱的局面。此次改进工作所得到的成绩，就是一个无可置辩的佐证。这一事实教育了我们，保守思想是阻碍工作前进的绊脚石，必须克服保守思想，工作才能不断前进。
