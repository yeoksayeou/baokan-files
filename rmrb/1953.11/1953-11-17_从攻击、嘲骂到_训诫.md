Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th. Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The American propaganda machine has recently launched a series of propaganda offensives against India, which holds the chairmanship of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. They are trying their best to portray the current stalemate in the explanation work, which is due to the obstruction and sabotage by the Li and Chiang secret agents directed by the U.S. side, as the Korean and Chinese side deliberately delaying the explanation and making things difficult for India; at the same time, they are arrogantly admonishing India to accept the so-called "Korean lesson" and change its neutral policy. Even General Hull, Commander of the U.S. Far East Command, openly declared on the 13th that he and General Taylor, Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, believed that the explanation work had given the Indians "the best lesson" against communism.

The "admonishment" of India by the American propaganda machine and government officials is obviously an insult to India as a neutral country. The United States is now applying the infamous McCarthyism to international relations. This "international McCarthyism" regards any country that is unwilling to serve the U.S. aggression policy as its enemy and threatens and intimidates it unscrupulously. Because India holds the chairmanship in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the United States believes that if India maintains neutrality, it will make it difficult for the United States to realize its conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work. Therefore, from the time the prisoners of war were handed over to the Indian custodial forces, Dulles and the entire propaganda machine employed by the U.S. side launched the most vicious attacks and ridicules against India. After such unwarranted attacks and ridicule caused great resentment around the world, the American propaganda machine and officials changed their tone to "admonishment" towards India. But whether it is ridicule or "admonishment," the sole purpose is to prevent India from maintaining neutrality and to try to force India to follow the United States and become a tool of the U.S. policy of aggressive war.

The U.S. attitude of regarding India as a vassal that can be arbitrarily admonished is obviously intolerable to any Indian with self-respect. An editorial published by the "Indian Times" on November 13th reflected the indignation of a wide range of strata in India. The editorial said, "Regardless of the many evidences unfavorable to the UN agents, it can also be boldly accused: Some irresponsible elements on the UN side have been actively working to influence the prisoners of war to make them unwilling to go home. In this case, India cannot be blamed if it refuses to believe that the slow progress of the prisoner exchange work is entirely due to the obstinacy of the Communist side... Anyone who comes to the conclusion that New Delhi can be said to be a self-deceiving tool that is being used is not only misunderstanding the facts, but also reducing the chances of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's mission being successfully completed."

The U.S. attitude of admonishing India also shows that the United States does not recognize any international regulations and moral principles. It believes that there is no such thing as a truly neutral country. Since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission arrived in Tongchang-ri, the United States has been teaching the several countries of the NNR commission every day, this one should stand on this side, and that one should stand on that side. It not only does not implement international regulations and moral principles itself, but also does not allow neutral countries to implement international regulations and moral principles. It exerted various pressures on certain members of the NNR commission, requiring them to abandon the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" on many issues, thereby achieving its purpose of sabotaging and obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. admonishing India is also an attempt to make India a neutral country standing on the U.S. side. For the same reason, the United States is now doing its best to obstruct the solution of the issue of membership of the Korean political conference. According to International News Service reporter Himaf on the 15th, the United States may request that India participate in the political conference as a neutral country chosen by the U.S. side. But people clearly remember that the United States not long ago wanted India to participate in the political conference as a neutral country chosen by the Korean and Chinese side. Now, what exactly has happened that India can suddenly become "the choice of the United States" again?

In contrast to the U.S. attitude of contempt and negation of neutral countries, the Korean and Chinese side have always believed that international regulations and moral principles must be observed, and that neutral countries are capable of implementing these international regulations and moral principles. The Korean and Chinese side's solemn and firm stance on the prisoner of war repatriation issue, as well as their respect for neutral countries and their sympathy and understanding for the difficulties they encounter in performing their tasks, have fully demonstrated this point.

### 从攻击、嘲骂到“训诫”

    从攻击、嘲骂到“训诫”
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美国宣传机器最近对担任中立国遣返委员会主席职位的印度展开了一系列的宣传攻势。它们竭力把目前解释工作由于美方指挥李、蒋特务进行阻挠破坏而陷于停顿的情况，硬说成是朝中方面故意拖延解释，和印度为难；同时它们又狂妄地训诫印度，要印度接受所谓“朝鲜的教训”，改变它的中立政策。甚至美军远东总司令赫尔也在十三日公开宣称，他和美军第八军军长泰勒认为，解释工作已使印度人上了一堂反对共产主义的“最好的课”。
    美国宣传机器和政府官员对印度的这种“训诫”，显然是对作为中立国家的印度的一种侮辱。美国现在正在把臭名远扬的麦卡锡主义应用到国际关系上来。这种“国际麦卡锡主义”把任何一个不愿意为美国侵略政策服务的国家都看成是自己的敌人，并且对它肆无忌惮地进行威胁和恐吓。由于印度在中立国遣返委员会中担任主席职位，美国认为如果印度保持中立，将使美国破坏解释工作的阴谋的实现遭到困难。因此从战俘移交给印度看管部队时起，杜勒斯以及美方御用的全部宣传机器，就对印度发动最恶毒的攻击和嘲骂。在这种无端的攻击和嘲骂在全世界引起了极大的反感之后，美国的宣传机器和官员们就对印度改用了“训诫”的口吻。但是无论嘲骂也好，“训诫”也好，唯一目的就是不许印度保持中立，企图强迫印度跟着美国走，成为美国侵略战争政策的工具。
    美国这种把印度看成可以随意教训的附庸的态度，显然是任何一个有自尊心的印度人所不能忍受的。“印度时报”在十一月十三日发表的社论，反映了印度广泛阶层的愤慨情绪。社论说， “姑且不论对联合国特务不利的许多证据，也可以大胆指责：联合国方面有些不负责任的分子一直在大肆活动，以影响战俘使他们不愿回家。在这种情况下，如果印度拒绝相信战俘交换工作之所以缓慢是完全由于共方的执拗，这是不能够怪印度的……谁要是竟然得出这样的结论，说新德里可以说是个自己哄自己的被人利用的工具，他不仅是看错了事实，而且这样一来，还减少了中立国遣返委员会的使命胜利完成的机会。”
    美国这种教训印度的态度，也表明美国不承认有什么国际法规和道义原则。它认为真正的中立国是没有的。自从中立国遣返委员会到了东场里以来，美国就天天教训中遣会的几个国家，这个要站在这一边，那个要站在那一边。它不但自己不执行国际法规和道义原则，而且不许中立国执行国际法规和道义原则。它对中遣会某些委员施用种种压力，要它们在许多问题上背弃“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，从而达到它破坏和阻挠中立国遣返委员会的工作的目的。美国教训印度，也就是企图使印度成为站在美国一边的中立国。也正是同样的原因，美国现在竭力阻挠朝鲜政治会议成员问题的解决。据国际新闻社记者希马夫十五日透露，美国可能要求让印度以美国方面选择的中立国的身分参加政治会议。但是人们明明记得，美国前不久还要印度以朝中方面选择的中立国身分来参加政治会议。现在，究竟发生了什么事情使印度忽然又可以变成是“美国方面的选择”了呢？
    和美国这种蔑视和否定中立国的态度相反，朝中方面始终认为必须遵守国际法规和道义原则，而且认为中立国是能够执行这些国际法规和道义原则的。朝中方面在战俘遣返问题上的严正坚定的立场，以及对中立国家的尊重和对它们在执行任务中所遭遇的困难的同情与谅解，已经充分证明了这一点。
