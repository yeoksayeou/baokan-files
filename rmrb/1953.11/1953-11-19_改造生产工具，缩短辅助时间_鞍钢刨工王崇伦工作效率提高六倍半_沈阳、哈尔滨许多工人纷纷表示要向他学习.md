Transforming Production Tools, Shortening Auxiliary Time
    Anshan Planer Wang Chonglun Increases Work Efficiency by Six and a Half Times
    Many Workers in Shenyang and Harbin Express Their Determination to Learn from Him
    Wang Chonglun, a planer operator at the tool workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Machinery General Plant, transformed his tools in April of this year and learned from the advanced experience of Wei Yuxi, saving auxiliary production time and increasing work efficiency by six and a half times. He completed this year's production task on July 15th and completed the 1954 production task by the end of September. By the beginning of November, he had already begun working on the second half of 1955.
    The tool workshop of the Machinery General Plant mainly undertakes the task of processing parts for rock drills used in various mines. The workshop uses six lathes and five milling machines to process rock drill parts, producing dozens of semi-finished products every day. However, in the third process—internal circle processing in the slotting and planing group—only one slotting machine can do this type of work, completing only four or five pieces per day. Therefore, large quantities of semi-finished products are piling up in the slotting and planing group. Moreover, because the slotting machine is out of order, more than half of the products are grade two. As a result, the workshop cannot complete its production plan.
    Wang Chonglun, the twenty-five-year-old leader of the slotting and planing group, is a Communist Party member and a member of the Communist Youth League. The fact that the slotting and planing group was hindering the entire workshop from completing its task weighed heavily on his mind. "Without rock drill parts, we cannot mine ore; without ore, we cannot refine steel; without steel, we cannot industrialize the country, and we cannot transition to socialism." Wang Chonglun remembered what the company manager had told the employees and felt particularly keenly the importance and glory of his responsibility. After more than half a month of painstaking research, with the support of the leadership and the help of technical personnel, he created a "universal tool base." By installing this tool base on the planer, the planer can not only plane flat surfaces but also plane circles and internal gears, greatly exceeding the original production target. In the past, planing an internal gear nut took thirty minutes; now, it only takes five minutes. One planer can replace six slotting machines, and all products are grade one. Originally, the state stipulated Wang Chonglun's monthly production quota at 190 hours. After creating the new tool, he completes 1,200 hours per month, that is, he can complete six months' worth of tasks in one month. He also humbly learned from the advanced experience of Wei Yuxi, a worker at the Jinxi Chemical Plant, and made reasonable arrangements for his work, greatly shortening auxiliary time. His work efficiency increased six and a half times compared to slotting machines. This enabled the workshop to achieve balanced production. Wang Chonglun's creation has great significance. If such "universal" tools appear in large numbers in machinery processing, manufacturing, and repair factories, it will greatly increase equipment capacity and solve the problem of equipment imbalance.
    Wang Chonglun takes great care of the machines and observes operating procedures in his work. He has not produced any defective products in four years and has not had any machine accidents in two years. He not only selflessly completes production tasks but also helps and encourages other workers to move forward together. He patiently trains apprentices, arriving early on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to teach apprentices operating techniques. Last year, he created seven tools and was selected as a labor model of the Machinery General Plant. Wang Chonglun's patriotic labor attitude and creative spirit have become a model for young workers. Many workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company are learning from Wang Chonglun, and they have achieved many new accomplishments in the increase production and practice economy movement. For example, Wang Zuocheng, a fitter at the Machinery General Plant, created a "scribing" tool, increasing work efficiency by fifteen times. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League recently issued a circular commending Wang Chonglun's excellent qualities of loving the motherland, loving labor, learning humbly, and creating wealth for the motherland, and called on all Youth League members and young people in the city to learn from him and strive to overfulfill the state's production tasks.
    Further News: After learning about Wang Chonglun's exemplary deeds, workers in factories in Shenyang and Harbin held discussion meetings and expressed their determination to learn from him. Li Runkui, leader of the paper copying group in the first workshop of the Shenyang Paper Mill, is a worker with twelve years of experience and has been elected as a labor model several times. After learning about Wang Chonglun's advanced example, he immediately led all the workers in his group to further tap their potential and revised their increase production and practice economy plan. Many workers at the Shenyang Machinery Third Factory held discussion meetings for two consecutive nights. Workers in the gear box group of the factory's first workshop specifically invited four technicians to participate in the discussion meeting. They put forward twenty-three suggestions for improving production on the spot. Lin Shitai, a famous production innovator in Harbin, and the workers in his group held a group discussion meeting on the afternoon of the same day they learned about the news, discussing how to learn from Wang Chonglun. The Harbin Federation of Trade Unions decided to call on all workers in the city to learn from Wang Chonglun.

    改造生产工具，缩短辅助时间
    鞍钢刨工王崇伦工作效率提高六倍半
    沈阳、哈尔滨许多工人纷纷表示要向他学习
    鞍钢机械总厂工具车间刨床工人王崇伦，在今年四月间改造了工具，并学习韦玉玺的先进经验，节省了辅助生产时间，使工作效率提高了六倍半。他在七月十五日完成了今年的生产任务，九月末又完成了一九五四年的生产任务，到十一月初已开始做一九五五年下半年的活了。
    机械总厂工具车间主要是担负着各矿山凿岩机零件的加工任务。这个车间用六台车床、五台铣床进行凿岩机零件的加工，每天能出几十件半成品，但到第三道工序——插刨组进行内圆加工时，只有一台插床能干这种活，每天只能完成四、五件，所以大批半成品积压在插刨组。并因插床不规矩，有一半以上的产品是二级品。这样，该车间就无法完成生产计划。
    二十五岁的插刨组组长王崇伦，是个共产党员又是青年团员。插刨组阻碍着全车间不能完成任务的事，像石头一样压在他的心上。“凿岩机没有零件就不能采矿石，没有矿石就不能炼钢铁，没有钢铁就不能使国家工业化，我们也就不能过渡到社会主义。”王崇伦想起公司经理对职工们讲的话，特别感到自己的责任的重大和光荣。他经过半个多月的苦心钻研，在领导上的支持和技术人员的帮助下，创造了一个“万能工具胎”，把这个工具胎安在刨床上，刨床就不仅能刨平面，而且能刨圆和刨内齿轮，大大突破了原有的生产指标。过去刨一个内齿螺母要用三十分钟，现在只用五分钟。一台刨床能顶六台插床使用，而且全部产品是一级品。原来国家规定王崇伦每月的生产定额是一百九十台时，他创造新工具后，每月完成一千二百台时，即一个月能完成六个月的任务。他又虚心学习了锦西化工厂工人韦玉玺的先进经验，将自己的工作做了合理的安排，使辅助时间大大缩短，工作效率与插床比较提高了六倍半。这就使该车间达到了平衡生产。王崇伦这一创造具有重大的意义，如在机械加工、制造、修配工厂里，大量出现这种“万能”性的工具，将会大大提高设备能力，解决设备不平衡的问题。
    王崇伦在工作中非常爱护机器，并遵守操作规程。他已经四年没有出过废品，两年没有出过机器事故。他不但忘我地完成生产任务，并且还帮助和带动其他工人一起前进。他很耐心地培养徒工，每星期一、三、五都提前上班，教徒工学操作技术。去年他曾创造了七件工具，被选为机械总厂的劳动模范。王崇伦这种爱国主义的劳动态度和创造精神，已经成为青年工人的榜样。鞍山钢铁公司很多工人向王崇伦学习，在增产节约运动中得到了不少新的成就。如机械总厂钳工王佐成创造了“划线”工具，提高工作效率十五倍。中国新民主主义青年团鞍山市委会最近发出通报，表扬了王崇伦热爱祖国，热爱劳动，虚心学习，为祖国创造财富的优良品质，并号召全市青年团员和青年们，向他学习，争取超额完成国家的生产任务。
    又讯：沈阳、哈尔滨各工厂工人知道了王崇伦的模范事迹后，纷纷举行座谈会，表示要向他学习。沈阳造纸厂一车间抄纸组组长李润奎是个十二年工龄的工人，曾几次当选为劳动模范，他知道了王崇伦的先进事例后，立即领导全组工人进一步挖掘潜力，修改了增产节约计划。沈阳机械三厂的许多工人，连续两个晚上举行座谈会。该厂一车间齿箱组的工人特地邀请四位技术人员参加座谈会，他们当场提出二十三件改进生产的建议。哈尔滨市著名的生产革新者林士太和他的小组工人们，在知道这个消息的当天下午就召开全组座谈会，讨论怎样向王崇伦学习。哈尔滨市工会联合会决定号召全市工人向王崇伦学习。
