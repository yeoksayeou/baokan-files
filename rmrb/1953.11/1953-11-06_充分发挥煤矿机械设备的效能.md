To achieve mechanized coal mining is the direction of development for China's coal mining industry. Over the past three years, China's coal mining industry has extensively replaced simple manual tools with modern equipment like combines, pneumatic picks, electric drills, electric conveyors, and mechanical ventilation. Currently, the level of mechanized coal mining nationwide has reached 23.2 percent, mechanized face transportation has reached 85.6 percent, mechanized roadway transportation has reached 66.03 percent, and mines employing mechanical ventilation account for 92 percent. The mechanization of coal mining production has fundamentally changed the harsh labor conditions and frequent accidents that plagued China's coal mines before liberation. It has given the mines a new look, greatly increased labor productivity, and powerfully guaranteed the supply of coal to industry, transportation, and people's daily lives.

However, many problems exist in the implementation of mechanized production in coal mines across the country. Coal mines are not effectively utilizing these modern production tools for production, and it has instead brought chaos to production. This roughly falls into the following categories: First, irrational use of mechanical equipment, resulting in the inability to realize their rational efficiency. For example, some mines equip a 75-horsepower winch with a 100-horsepower motor. The Datong Mine in Huainan installed a 500-horsepower water pump in a location where the water inflow was less than two cubic meters, resulting in the pump being shut down after running for less than two hours each day. The losses in this regard are extremely alarming. According to a survey by the Yangquan Mining Bureau's Fourth Mine alone, if the existing electromechanical equipment could be rationally adjusted and used, 2 billion to 3 billion yuan could be saved annually. Second, there is a general lack of attention to the maintenance and repair of electromechanical equipment. Cleaning, inspection, and oiling are neglected. Spare parts are lacking, and the equipment is left to corrode and wear out, only being repaired when it breaks down. An inspection of 51 transformers at the Yangquan Fourth Mine found that 24 were leaking oil. Third, destructive use of mechanical equipment. For example, underground explosion-proof devices were originally intended to prevent gas explosions, but comrades at the Huainan Coal Mine drilled many holes in the explosion-proof mechanical equipment, destroying the explosion-proof performance of the equipment. Or there are frequent violations of regulations, using machines in excess of their load capacity. The evil consequences of these poor usage practices are constant accidents, shortened machine life, and disruption of normal production. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 1,500 electromechanical accidents in coal mines in the first half of this year alone, resulting in serious casualties and losses of national wealth. This year, the Yangquan Coal Mine had a total of 105 electromechanical accidents and failures. The minimum estimate is that this resulted in an output reduction of 5,000 tons of coal, with losses reaching 500 million yuan. From January to May this year, the Hegang Coal Mine lost a total of 730 hours of production time due to electromechanical accidents and failures. In addition, some coal mines, because they do not know how to use these machines and do not study hard, simply send them to the warehouse. According to statistics for the first quarter of this year, 23 coal cutters and 167 electric drills were left unused in North China coal mines alone. Similar situations exist in coal mines in the Northeast, East China, and other regions. (Some mining bureaus have rationally preserved some spare machinery, which is necessary and should not be considered as stockpiling.)

The reasons for these serious situations are, first of all, that leading cadres at all levels in coal mines lack sufficient understanding of the importance of mechanization and lack the spirit of hard work and study with regard to new production technologies. The investment of a large number of modern mechanical equipment into production requires us to transform many original tasks in coal mine production, including changing old habits, in order to adapt to it. This is an extremely difficult and complex task, but many coal mine leading cadres do not have sufficient understanding of this point and have not made efforts to learn, resulting in the fact that the production management and technical management in many coal mines are still very backward and cannot keep up with the needs of mechanized production. Secondly, the technical level of workers and grassroots cadres cannot keep up with the needs of mechanization. Workers who have long been accustomed to manual coal mining cannot quickly improve their technical level. They are unfamiliar with the mechanical properties, mechanical operation, and maintenance, and even do not understand them at all. For example, the Fengfeng Coal Mine once installed a new 300-horsepower winch. Halfway through the winch installation, there were still many parts that they did not know where to install. According to the analysis of electromechanical accidents in national state-owned coal mines, accidents caused by poor operation account for about 53 percent, which fully illustrates the significant impact of low technical level on work. Again, there is a lack of specific responsibility systems and the failure to implement operating procedures effectively. The phenomenon of no one being responsible for the use of electromechanical equipment in many coal mines is very serious. For example, there is no one specifically responsible for managing underground electric conveyors and local fans. Some winches are temporarily assigned drivers every day, and as a result, no one can be held accountable when accidents occur. Many coal mines do not use machinery in accordance with the regulations and do not carry out timely maintenance as required, often resulting in damage to the machinery.

Coal mines across the country are now enthusiastically carrying out production increase and economy campaigns, striving to overfulfill the state plan and making full preparations for next year's production. To this end, improving the current chaotic state of mechanized production is undoubtedly an urgent task, and the leadership of coal mines in various places should put this work on the important agenda. We must strengthen production management and technical management, and mobilize engineering and technical personnel to work with workers to study ways to rationally use machinery and improve procedures. We must establish various responsibility systems step by step to overcome the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible for the use of electromechanical equipment. From experimental research to use and maintenance, we must ensure that someone is responsible everywhere. The electromechanical specialized agencies must be responsible for the rational allocation, inspection, and repair of electromechanical equipment. The using departments must be responsible for correct operation in accordance with operating and maintenance procedures. We must strengthen daily maintenance and regular maintenance, especially for major electromechanical equipment, large and heavy machinery, and we must implement a regular maintenance system. Experience has proven that this is the only way to ensure safety, improve utilization, and extend service life. In addition, we must strengthen education on production discipline for cadres and workers, and earnestly implement operating procedures to ensure production and ensure safety. Each mining bureau should formulate specific operating methods, operating systems, and maintenance systems based on its own equipment conditions, submit them to workers for study and discussion, and educate workers and cadres to strictly abide by these procedures and systems. This is an important component of electromechanical equipment technical management and is the only practical and effective method for improving the technical level of cadres and workers at this stage. Finally, mining bureaus in various places should strengthen technical education for workers, improve the methods of technical education, formulate technical education plans, and actively and systematically strengthen technical forces to meet the needs of future production development.

    充分发挥煤矿机械设备的效能
    机械化采煤是我国煤矿工业发展的方向。我国煤矿工业三年多来曾大量地以康拜因割煤机、风镐、电钻、电溜子、机械通风等等近代化设备代替了过去手工操作的简单工具。到目前为止，全国煤矿机械化采煤程度已达百分之二十三点二，工作面运输机械化程度已达百分之八十五点六，巷道运输机械化程度已达百分之六十六点○三，采用机械化通风的矿井已占百分之九十二。煤矿生产机械化的结果，根本改变了解放前我国煤矿恶劣的劳动条件和事故频繁的情况，使得矿井的面貌一新，大大地提高了劳动生产率，从而有力地保证了我国煤矿对工业交通运输和人民生活的燃煤供应。
    但是，现在各地煤矿在实行机械化生产中，却存在着许多问题，煤矿中还不能很好的来利用这种近代化的生产工具进行生产，反而给生产带来了纷乱。这大体有如下几种情况：第一种情况是：不合理地使用机械设备，以致不能合理发挥机械效率。例如有的矿井七十五马力的绞车却配备了一百马力的马达。淮南大通矿在涌水量不到两立方公尺水的地方，却装上了一个五百马力的水泵，结果水泵每天开不到二小时就只好停机了。这方面的损失是极为惊人的，仅据阳泉矿务局四矿的调查，该矿如果能将现有机电设备加以合理的调整使用，每年即可节省二十亿到三十亿元。第二种情况是：对机电设备普遍不注意维护和检修，既不清扫，不检查，更缺油、缺少备件，任其腐蚀磨损，不坏不修。阳泉四矿检查了五十一台变压器，发现有二十四台漏油。第三种情况是：破坏性的使用机械设备，例如井下防爆装置原是为了防止瓦斯爆炸的，但淮南煤矿的同志却在防爆机械设备上打了许多洞，结果把设备的防爆性能破坏了。或者是经常违反规定，在超过负荷量的情况下使用机器。以上这几种使用不善的恶果，就是事故不断发生，机器寿命缩短，并破坏了生产的正常进行。据不完全的统计，今年上半年煤矿机电事故共达一千五百余次，因而造成的人身伤亡和国家财富的损失都很严重。阳泉煤矿今年发生了机电事故和故障共一百零五次，最低估计是少产了五千吨煤，损失达五亿元。鹤岗煤矿今年一至五月份由于机电事故和故障共损失了生产时间七百三十小时。此外，还有些煤矿因为不会使用这些机械，也不好好学习，就干脆把这些机器送进了仓库。据今年第一季度统计，仅华北煤矿中就有二十三部割煤机和一百六十七台电钻被搁置着没有使用，东北、华东等地区的煤矿也都有类似的情况（有些矿务局合理地保存了一些备用机械，这是必要的，当然不能算做积压）。
    产生以上这些严重情况的原因，首先是煤矿各级领导干部中对于机械化的重要性认识不足，对于新的生产技术缺乏艰苦钻研学习的精神。大量近代化机械设备的投入生产，要求我们必须改造煤矿生产中原来的许多工作，包括改造旧的习惯，才能和它相适应。这是一项极为艰巨复杂的工作，但许多煤矿领导干部对这点认识不足，也没有努力去学习，因而使得目前许多煤矿中的生产管理和技术管理还很落后，跟不上机械化生产的需要。其次，是工人和基层干部的技术水平也跟不上机械化的需要。长期习惯于手工采煤的工人们技术水平不能很快提高，他们对机械性能的掌握、机械操作和维护都不熟悉，甚至根本不懂。例如峰峰煤矿曾装了一部三百马力的新式绞车，绞车安装了一半，还有许多机件不知往那里装上去。据全国国营煤矿机电事故的分析，由于操作不良而引起的事故约占百分之五十三，这就充分说明了技术水平低对于工作的重大影响。再次，就是缺乏专责制度和没有很好贯彻操作规程。许多煤矿中机电设备使用无人负责现象是十分严重的，如井下电溜子及局部风扇无专人管理，有的绞车每天临时派人开车，结果出了事故也找不到责任者。许多煤矿不按照规程来使用机械，不按规定及时进行检修，结果常常把机械弄坏了。
    全国各地煤矿现在正在热烈地开展增产节约竞赛，争取超额完成国家计划，并为明年的生产做好充分准备。为此，改善目前机械化生产中的这种混乱状态，无疑是一项刻不容缓的任务，各地煤矿领导上应把这件工作摆到重要的日程上来。必须加强生产管理和技术管理，发动工程技术人员与工人共同来研究合理使用机械的办法和改善的步骤；必须有步骤地建立起各种责任制，克服机电设备使用上严重的无人负责现象，从试验研究到使用和检修，要做到处处有人负责，机电专责机构要负责对机电设备合理配备、检查及修理的责任，使用部门要担负正确的、即按照规程操作和维护的责任。必须加强日常维护和定期检修工作，特别是主要机电设备、大型和重型的机械，必须贯彻定期检修制度。经验证明这是保证安全、提高利用率和延长使用期限的唯一的办法。此外，还要加强对干部和工人生产的纪律教育，切实贯彻操作规程，以保证生产保证安全。各矿务局应根据自己的设备情况，制订具体的操作方法、运行制度和检修制度，提交工人学习讨论，教育工人及干部严格遵守这些规程及制度，这就是机电设备技术管理重要的组成部分，也是在现阶段提高干部和工人技术水平唯一实际有效的方法。最后，各地矿务局应该加强对工人的技术教育，改善技术教育的方式方法，订出技术教育的计划，积极地有计划地来壮大技术力量，以适应今后生产发展的需要。
