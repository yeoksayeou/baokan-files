Letters from readers Xie Zhaokun and Chen Tingyuan: On January 26th of this year, our Andong City Company of the China Department Store Corporation of Liaodong Province suddenly received five hundred bolts of bed sheet strips and colored flannel strips, valued at over 150 million yuan, from the Changshu City Cotton and Linen Company of Jiangsu Province. This surprised us, because our company had not ordered these goods from them, and had never had any purchasing or other contact with them. We thought, perhaps the transportation unit sent it to the wrong place? But on the price list (acting as an invoice) attached with the goods, stamped with the seals of the company's manager and accounting section chief, the "Consignee" column clearly stated Andong Department Store Company. Or was it sent to Liaodong Provincial Department Store Company, which is also in Andong City? We asked the Provincial Department Store Company, but it wasn't them either. Our company considered that if we returned the goods, it would inevitably cause more waste in manpower, financial resources, and transportation capacity, so we decided to first write a letter to the Changshu City Cotton and Linen Company to inquire. Unexpectedly, a letter was sent at the end of January, and no reply was received by mid-June. In order to prevent state funds from continuing to be tied up, our company reported to the local Commercial Bureau while promoting the sale of these fabrics at a price set by the pricing table; at the same time, we sent an official letter to the East China Region Cotton and Linen Company requesting inquiries and resolution, explaining that we would remit the payment after the reply came. This official letter was also sent to Changshu City Cotton and Linen Company. In mid-July, our company sent another official letter to the above two places to urge them to handle the matter. In early August, we wrote another report detailing the situation and sent it as an official letter to the China Cotton and Linen General Company to inquire and request a reply. However, all these official letters were sent out and there was no news. By late September, we had not received any reply. Could it be that the shipping unit doesn't want the payment for these goods? This really puzzles us. We hope that the above three cotton and linen companies will thoroughly investigate and handle this long-standing case that has not been resolved for a full nine months, and ensure that such a phenomenon of no one taking responsibility will not occur in the future.

    五百匹布究竟是发给谁的
    读者谢肇焜、陈廷源来信：今年一月二十六日，我们中国百货公司辽东省安东市公司突然收到江苏省常熟市花纱布公司发来价值一亿五千余万元的被单条和彩条绒五百匹。这使我们很惊奇，因为我们公司并没有向他们订购这批货物，而且从来没有和他们发生过采购或其他联系。我们想也许是运输单位送错了地方吧？但在随货附来的有该公司经理、财会科长盖章的计价表（代发票）上，“受货单位”一栏明明填的是安东百货公司。或者是发给同在安东市的辽东省百货公司的吧？我们问了省百货公司，也不是。我们公司考虑，如果把货退回去，在人力、财力、运输力上势必造成更多浪费，所以决定先写信到常熟市花纱布公司去查询。不料一月底去了信，到六月中旬还没有得到答复。为了使国家资金不再继续积压，我们公司一面报告本地商业局，按计价表订价推销这些布；一面用正式公函发给华东区花纱布公司请求查询和解决，说明等答复来后将货款汇去。这份公函同时也发给了常熟市花纱布公司。七月中旬，我们公司再发出公函给上述两处催办。八月上旬，我们又将经过情形写成报告用公函发到中国花纱布总公司查询并请求答复。但是，所有这些公函发出后都渺无音讯。直到九月下旬，我们没接到任何回音。难道发货单位不要这笔货款了吗？这实在使我们纳闷。我们希望上述三个花纱布公司切实查清和处理这件经过了整整九个多月还未解决的悬案，并保证今后不再出现这种无人负责的现象。
