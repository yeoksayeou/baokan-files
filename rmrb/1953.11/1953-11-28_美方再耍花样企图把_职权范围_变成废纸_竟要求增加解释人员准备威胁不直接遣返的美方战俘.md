Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: A U.S. military announcement on the 24th proves that the U.S. is now preparing to arbitrarily undermine the armistice agreement on POW issues concerning the explanation to U.S. POWs who will not be directly repatriated. According to letters to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) released by the so-called United Nations Command, the U.S. requested the NNRC on November 11th to approve an increase in U.S. interpreters from the original five to fifteen. However, Section A of Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly stipulates that the number of interpretation representatives shall not exceed seven and not be less than five for every 1,000 prisoners of war under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, while the total number of U.S. POWs who will not be directly repatriated is only over 350. After this request, which openly violated the agreement, was resolutely rejected by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. continued to pester the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In a second letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 24th, the U.S. shamelessly put forward the so-called "freedom and convenience" for the countries to which the POWs belong to send interpreters, as a "reason" to violate the agreement and demand to send five interpreters each for the explanation of 22 U.S. POWs, 1 British POW, and 328 South Korean POWs according to their nationalities.

The absurd behavior of the U.S. is a continuation of its conspiracy to deliberately undermine the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The U.S. has tried every means to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side to the POWs, making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its functions. Now, after a long period of planning, it is repeating its old tricks on the issue of explaining to U.S. POWs. The U.S. obviously believes that as long as it is beneficial to it, it can overturn the agreement it has signed and turn the "Terms of Reference" into waste paper.

Since the Korean and Chinese side transferred the U.S. POWs who will not be directly repatriated to the custody of the Neutral Nations, the U.S. immediately carried out intense arrangements, mobilizing "psychological warfare" experts and secret agents to conduct highly secret specialized training for the U.S. interpreters, so that these interpreters would be familiar with the "way of attacking" U.S. POWs who are unwilling to return to the U.S. reactionary rule (Reuters); at the same time, it manufactured a large number of letters and telegrams and collected a large number of newspapers and magazines, sending them to the POWs in the North Camp to coerce and intimidate them. To this end, all the U.S. POWs in the North Camp protested to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on November 6th, denouncing this "illegal and despicable" action by the U.S. However, the U.S. is not satisfied with its actions of undermining the agreement so far, and is now continuing to play tricks in an attempt to force the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to allow it to carry out explanations in the way it chooses.

The purpose of this series of furtive and rogue behaviors by the U.S. is very clear. United Press reported from Panmunjom on the 25th that the U.S. believes that the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are "obstacles" for the U.S., and the U.S. must "overcome" these "obstacles" in order to, as Associated Press admitted, "bring back as many Americans, Britons, and South Koreans as possible." Precisely because of this, the U.S. is now blatantly undermining the explicit provisions of the "Terms of Reference", unreasonably attempting to increase the number of interpreters in order to facilitate the coercion of U.S. POWs who are unwilling to return to their country. This fact once again exposes the ugly face of the U.S. using POWs for "psychological warfare" under the guise of so-called "respecting the freedom of will of POWs."

### 美方再耍花样企图把“职权范围”变成废纸  竟要求增加解释人员准备威胁不直接遣返的美方战俘

    美方再耍花样企图把“职权范围”变成废纸
    竟要求增加解释人员准备威胁不直接遣返的美方战俘
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美国军方二十四日的一项宣布，证明美方现在又准备在对不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释的问题上，恣意破坏停战协定关于战俘问题的协议。根据所谓联军司令部公布的先后写给中立国遣返委员会的信件，美方曾在十一月十一日要求中立国遣返委员会批准把美方解释人员由原定的五人增加到十五人。但是“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款甲项明白规定：解释代表的数目，在中立国遣返委员会看管下的每一千名战俘中不得超过七人和不少于五人，而不直接遣返的美方战俘总数只有三百五十多人。美方在这一公开破坏协定的要求遭到中立国遣返委员会的断然拒绝之后，仍继续和中立国遣返委员会进行纠缠。在二十四日第二次写给中立国遣返委员会的信里，美方竟极其无赖地提出所谓按照协议，战俘所属国家有“自由与便利”来派遣解释人员，作为破坏协议、要求在对二十二名美国战俘、一名英国战俘和三百二十八名南朝鲜战俘进行解释时按国别各派五名解释人员的“理由”。
    美方这种无理取闹的荒谬行径，是它蓄意破坏 “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的阴谋的继续。美方想尽办法破坏朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，使中立国遣返委员会无法行使其职权。现在，在经过长期策划以后，又在对美方战俘进行解释的问题上重施故技。美方显然认为：只要于它有利，就可以推翻它所签字的协议，把“职权范围”变成废纸。
    自从朝中方面将不直接遣返的美方战俘移交中立国看管以后，美方即一面进行紧张的布置，调集“心理战”专家和特务人员对美方解释人员进行内容极其秘密的专门训练，使这些解释人员熟悉对不愿回到美方反动统治下的美方战俘的“进攻之道”
  （路透社）；一面则制造大批信件和电报并收集大量报纸与杂志，把它们寄给北营的战俘，对他们进行胁迫和恫吓。为此，北营中的全体美方战俘曾在十一月六日向中立国遣返委员会提出抗议，斥责美方这种“非法的和卑鄙的”行动。但是，美方并不以它迄今已有的破坏协议的行动为满足，现在正在继续玩弄花样，企图迫使中立国遣返委员会准许它按照它所选择的方式来进行解释。
    美方这一系列鬼鬼祟祟和无赖的行径，目的十分明显。合众社在二十五日发自板门店的消息说：美方认定“职权范围”与中立国遣返委员会所制订的“解释和访问工作细则”是美方的“障碍”，美方必须“越过”这些“障碍”，以便如美联社所承认的，“尽可能多地把美国人、英国人和南朝鲜人弄回来”。正是这样，美方现在竟不惜公开破坏“职权范围”的明文规定，毫无道理地企图增加解释人员，以便于对不愿回国的美方战俘进行胁迫。这个事实再一次揭露了美方在所谓“尊重战俘自由意志”的招牌下利用战俘进行“心理战”的丑恶面目。
