Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th: The nationally renowned model factory, the Fifth Third Factory, comprehensively fulfilled its annual national plan 44 days ahead of schedule on the 17th and overfulfilled its annual profit delivery plan. All factory workers, filled with joy, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting this good news and proposed new plans for increasing production and practicing economy.

The Fifth Third Factory comprehensively completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule at 4:00 PM on the 17th. The average production balance rate reached 96.58%, an increase of 1.51% compared to the end of last year; the average product quality reached 95.7%, exceeding the national plan target by 1.2%; the average product cost from January to September was 4.059% lower than the national plan target; the average turnover rate of working capital reached 4.679 times, exceeding the national plan target by 0.429 times; and the average labor productivity was 24.8% higher than the national plan target.

In their letter to Chairman Mao, all employees said that they were able to achieve these results because they seriously discussed the national plan in the first quarter of this year, formulated an action plan to complete the national plan 40 days ahead of schedule, vigorously promoted various advanced Soviet experiences in the execution of the plan, improved labor productivity, and reduced costs. At the same time, they strengthened plan management, implemented job plans and various responsibility systems, ensuring that the production balance rate and product quality continued to improve, and the national plan was completed evenly month by month. The letter said that since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign in September, they had further revised the annual production increase and economy plan to 50 billion, of which 41.6 billion has now been completed, accounting for 83.2% of the annual production increase and economy plan. They told Chairman Mao in the letter that by the end of September, they had already delivered 13 billion yuan in profits to the state, a figure that greatly exceeded the annual profit delivery plan.

In the letter, all employees also put forward a new guarantee: that in addition to completing the 50 billion production increase and economy plan by the end of the year, they will increase production and save another 4.3 billion, for a total of 54.3 billion in wealth created for the country through increased production and economy throughout the year, and complete the formulation of the 1954 national plan ahead of schedule to welcome new tasks next year.

    五三工厂已完成全年生产和上缴利润计划
    全厂职工写信向毛主席报告喜讯
    自动追加任务到年底再增产节约四十三亿元
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】全国著名的模范工厂——五三工厂已在十七日提前四十四天全面完成了全年国家计划，并提前超额完成了全年上缴利润计划。全厂职工在欢欣鼓舞中写信向毛主席报告了这个喜讯，并提出了新的增产节约计划。
    五三工厂是在十七日下午四时提前全面完成全年生产计划的，生产均衡率平均达到百分之九十六点五八，比去年年底提高百分之一点五一；产品质量平均达到百分之九十五点七，超过了国家计划指标百分之一点二；产品成本，一至九月份平均比国家计划指标降低了百分之四点零五九；流动资金周转次数平均达到四点六七九次，超过了国家计划指标百分之零点四二九次；劳动生产率平均比国家计划指标提高了百分之二四点八。
    全体职工在给毛主席的信中说，他们所以能取得这些成绩，是由于他们在今年第一季度认真地讨论了国家计划，制订出了提前四十天完成国家计划的行动计划，并在执行计划当中，大力推广了各种苏联先进经验，提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本。同时，加强了计划管理，贯彻了作业计划和各项责任制度，保证了生产均衡率和产品质量不断提高，逐月均衡地完成国家计划。信中说，九月份增产节约竞赛开展以后，他们又增订出了五百亿的全年增产节约计划，这个计划现在已完成了四百一十六亿，占全年增产节约计划的百分之八十三点二。他们在信中告诉毛主席说：到九月底止，他们已上缴给国家一百三十亿元的利润，这个数字已大大超过了全年的上缴利润计划。
    在信中，全体职工又提出了新的保证：到年底要在完成五百亿的增产节约计划之外，再增产节约四十三亿，全年共为国家增产节约五百四十三亿的财富，并提前完成制订一九五四年的国家计划，迎接明年新的任务。
