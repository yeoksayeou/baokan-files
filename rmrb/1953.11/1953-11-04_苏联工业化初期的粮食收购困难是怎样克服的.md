How the Difficulties of Grain Procurement Were Overcome in the Early Stage of Soviet Industrialization
Yang Chengdong

I. Difficulties in Grain Procurement and Serious Consequences

In the early stage of implementing socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, difficulties in grain procurement emerged.

The severe grain difficulty was discovered in early 1928. Notable situations were: (1) Due to the year-by-year recovery of grain production, the output in 1926-1927 had reached more than 90% of the pre-war level, and the difficulty in grain procurement was not due to a reduction in grain output; (2) The three years before 1927 were consecutive bumper harvests, and optimistic estimates existed regarding the grain purchase problem at the time; (3) Since the implementation of the grain tax system, the grain controlled by the state mainly relied on market procurement. For several years, grain purchases were not only able to meet the needs of cities and the army, but also able to secure a considerable amount of export grain each year in exchange for industrial equipment and raw materials (123 million poods were exported in 1925-6, and 153 million poods were exported the following year. Each pood equals 16.38 kilograms).

At that time, the state needed to control approximately 500 million poods of grain annually to supply the needs of cities, industrial areas, technical crop areas, and the Red Army. In early 1928, a severe grain difficulty was discovered, and the procurement plan could not be completed, with 128 million poods less procured compared to the same period last year. The serious situation caused by this was: because the export plan could not be completed, the necessary industrial equipment and raw materials could not be imported according to the plan, which affected the first Five-Year Plan that had just begun. For example, cotton and flax could not be imported, and the textile sector suspended work and reduced production; insufficient grain supply caused many departments to show signs of disintegration; due to the adoption of temporary "extraordinary measures" to purchase grain, phenomena of commandism occurred, with door-to-door searches, closure of some local markets, destruction of revolutionary laws, and restoration of methods from the period of military communism in some areas, bringing new threats to the worker-peasant alliance; finally, speculators and kulaks manipulated the market, creating panic and causing great political damage to the Party and the state.

II. Basic Reasons for the Difficulty of Grain Procurement

The difficulty of grain procurement was not simply due to accidental factors such as planning errors, but, as Stalin pointed out, "the reasons for the difficulty here are much deeper." [Note 1] What was manifested at that time was that the demand for marketable grain (grain sold by peasants) was growing extremely rapidly, while the amount of marketable grain was not only growing extremely slowly, but there was even a danger of it falling.

Why did the demand for marketable grain grow so rapidly? Mainly because industry grew and the number of workers increased; cities grew, with the urban population increasing by 4% annually (the total Soviet population increased by 2.3% annually); agricultural areas producing technical crops (cotton, flax, sugar beets, etc.) grew, and these areas not only did not produce grain, but also needed to increase the supply of grain; finally, in order to exchange for industrial equipment and strive for an increase in foreign exchange funds, it was necessary to export part of the grain.

Why did the marketable grain grow so slowly? There are several reasons:

	(1) After the victory of the revolution, the agricultural structure was dispersed from large commodity economic units (kulak and landlord farms) into semi-self-sufficient small peasant economies. After the revolution, the number of peasant households changed from 16 million to 24 million. Before the revolution, landlords and kulaks could provide 47% and 34% of marketable grain in their own grain production. Small peasants can only provide 14.7% of the total amount of marketable grain. Therefore, although the total grain output in 1927 had reached 91% of the pre-war level, the commodity part of the total grain output was at most equal to 37% of the pre-war level, and there was a danger of the commodity part of the total grain output continuing to decline. [Note 2] At that time, the Soviet Union was still a country dominated by small peasant economies, and the middle peasant was the "central figure" in the countryside after the revolution. Although state farms and collective farms had large grain yields and provided a high amount of commodities, their grain production at that time only accounted for 1.7% of the national grain output, only one-eighth of the output of the kulaks, and even less than individual farmers, so it could not change the situation. Stalin said that the emergence of the grain crisis was due to "the excessively slow pace of agricultural development." [Note 3]

	(2) The resistance of the kulaks has increased. The three years of bumper harvests enabled the kulaks to accumulate capital. As Stalin pointed out, the kulaks understood that "grain cannot be regarded as an ordinary commodity," it is "a treasure among treasures," which can not only be used to exploit poor peasants, but also is a means to strengthen kulak elements politically and economically. [Note 4] From 1927 onwards, the kulaks openly resisted the state's price policy and refused to sell surplus grain to the state. The wealthy elements in the countryside with surplus grain (even a large number of wealthy Communist Party members) were all influenced by the kulaks and refused to sell grain to the state.

	(3) Other special reasons and shortcomings in leadership work: frost and drought in Ukraine and the North Caucasus reduced grain production by about 300 million poods; insufficient and untimely supply of industrial products to rural areas; grain purchase prices were too low and did not make corresponding and appropriate increases compared with other commodities; errors in taxation (light taxes for wealthy farmers); improper grain consumption; the state unnecessarily assumed the grain supply for small and medium-sized cities; shortcomings in the work of grain purchasing agencies, cooperatives, and Party and government organizations; the panic caused by door-to-door searches and market closures; the destruction and sabotage of speculators and kulaks, etc.

The emergence of extreme contradictions between the supply and demand of marketable grain led to difficulties in grain procurement. From an overall perspective, this was a difficulty in the advancement of the cause of socialist industrialization, and it had nothing in common with the difficulties caused by the decline of agriculture in any capitalist or colonial country. Moreover, precisely because it was a difficulty arising in the course of advancement, it would inevitably be resolved with the progress of the socialist cause.

III. Overcoming the Difficulties

After strenuous efforts, the difficulties were initially overcome by the end of 1928.

After the completion of agricultural collectivization, the Soviet Union's grain problem was largely solved. It was not until last year's 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that Comrade Malenkov declared the final solution of the grain problem. It can be seen that this is a problem that must be solved through long-term efforts.

In "On the Grain Front" and other documents, Stalin pointed out that the way out of the grain crisis was to develop large-scale, collectively cultivated, socialist farms (collective farms and state farms) that could use tractors and agricultural machinery. In November 1928, Stalin said that because the total output of individual farmers was still six times more than the total output of collective farms and state farms, it was necessary to vigorously help individual farmers (poor peasants, middle peasants) expand their harvests at that time.

Developing and consolidating collective farms and state farms is the fundamental way to solve the grain problem. According to Lenin's instructions on agricultural collectivization, the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on carrying out agricultural collectivization as much as possible. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also decided to organize state farms (also called "huge grain factories") that could produce 100 million poods of commodity grain in three or four years, and established the "Grain Trust" to implement this resolution. The state provided a large amount of funds and tractors to socialized agriculture (by June 1930, it was able to supply more than 55,000 tractors - this was the material and technical condition for strengthening the agricultural collectivization movement at that time). The cultivated area was rapidly expanded. In 1929, the grain output of socialized agriculture reached 400 million poods, and the marketable grain provided exceeded 130 million poods - that is, it had already exceeded the marketable grain provided by the kulaks in 1927. At the end of 1929, Stalin announced that the policy of eliminating kulaks would replace the policy of restricting kulaks. In 1933, collective farms were able to hand over more than 1 billion poods of grain to the state. This is the practice and confirmation of what Stalin pointed out: in order to escape the grain crisis, it is not to rely on reducing the speed of industrial development, but to "increase the speed of development of the grain industry to a level that can ensure the rapid development of the entire national economy, industry and agriculture." [Note 5]

As for increasing the grain output of individual farmers, because individual farmers still played a major role in grain and raw material production within a certain period of time, the state vigorously helped poor and middle peasants obtain fine seeds, fertilizers, and simple agricultural machinery, organized individual farmers into the cooperative system, signed advance contracts for grain and other agricultural products with the entire countryside, lent them funds and commodities, and strengthened the technical and cultural assistance of state farms and collective farms to individual farmers.

One of the important steps to overcome the difficulties of grain procurement was to resolutely attack the kulaks. Comrade Stalin pointed out that applying pressure to the kulaks and squeezing out their large reserves of surplus grain was "a new source of grain" domestically. [Note 6] The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government adopted many extraordinary measures, stipulating in law that if kulaks and speculators refused to sell surplus grain to the state at the stipulated price, the surplus grain would be confiscated, and also stipulated that 25% of the confiscated kulak grain could be enjoyed by poor peasants. In addition, the state levied individual taxes on the wealthiest part of the kulaks, who accounted for 3% of the population. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union insisted on steadily relying on the poor peasants, consolidating the alliance with the middle peasants, resolutely opposing the kulaks, mobilizing the political army of millions of poor and middle peasants, defeating the kulaks' offensive, and winning the victory on the grain front.

In addition to the above basic policies, the following important measures were also taken:

	Promote the system of pre-purchase contracts for grain and agricultural products. This method can help poor and middle peasants develop production, expand the state's procurement of agricultural products, and influence the direction of agricultural development. This method promoted the development of agricultural collectivization and enabled the small-scale individual economy to advance towards a planned track. In 1929, the state ordered 54% of spring-sown grain, 44% of autumn-sown grain, all cotton, most of sugar beets, and half of flax through pre-purchase contracts (in 1932, after the victory of the agricultural collectivization movement, a grain mandatory sales system was adopted).

	Improve the supply of industrial products to rural areas. Strengthen the production of agricultural means of production and consumer goods supplied to rural areas. Develop the system of rural cooperatives, overcome the anarchy in market relations, and strengthen the connection between the socialist economy and the peasants. In order to overcome the difficulty that the growth in demand for industrial products exceeded the growth in supply capacity, in addition to formulating commodity circulation plans and allocating industrial products according to the significance of the national economy in various regions, the state paid special attention to strengthening the supply of commodities to rural areas (reducing the quantity of commodities supplied to cities when necessary), and stipulated that this work should be done better after the harvest and during the grain purchase period.

	Implement a system of fixed grain quotas. At the end of 1928, some cities began to implement grain rationing. Because this rationing system was not caused by a decline in production, the implementation of this system did not lower the living standards of workers, but only made the grain supply subject to the needs of planned construction. In the second quarter of 1929, a universal rationing system for grain and sugar was implemented. Later, the rationing system was extended to other important foods (and later gradually implemented purchase restrictions and quota supply systems for some industrial products).

IV. The Struggle Against the Right-leaning Capitulationists

The grain difficulties strengthened the blind spontaneity of the petty bourgeoisie, which promoted the development of right-leaning dangers. Stalin pointed out in October 1928 that although both "left" and right tendencies existed within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at that time, the right-leaning danger was the main danger.

The Bukharin and Rykov group were agents of the kulaks within the Party, and their reactionary faces could not be concealed after the struggle to attack the kulaks unfolded. This group was a right-leaning opportunist group within the Party, a capitulationist group moving towards bourgeois ideology. The representatives of the right-leaning danger were a group of wealthy party members in the grassroots party organizations in rural areas, who colluded with the kulaks to oppose the grain purchase policy. In the Party, government, and cooperative organizations at all levels, and even among the members of the Party Central Committee, there were representatives of right-leaning dangers or people who adopted a conciliatory attitude towards this danger. At that time, the difficulties in grain procurement could not be overcome without overcoming right-leaning and the conciliatory attitude towards right-leaning.

The right-leaning capitulationists opposed the general line of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The disputes between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Bukharin group, related to the grain problem, mainly included the following issues: First, the so-called "normalization" of the market and the issue of raising grain purchase prices - the right-leaning capitulationists opposed the Party's price policy, advocated abolishing the state's regulatory role in the market, allowing complete freedom of trade, allowing free manipulation of prices, and allowing kulaks and speculators to make a fortune. Second, the issue of the speed of industrialization and the import of grain from abroad - Bukharin opposed using "extraordinary means" to deal with the kulaks. He advocated importing grain from abroad to alleviate the crisis. This would hinder the import of industrial equipment and reduce the speed of industrial development. The right-leaning elements originally opposed the cause of socialist industrialization, advocated only developing light industry and opposed the policy of focusing on the development of heavy industry. Third, the so-called agricultural "degeneration" problem - the right-wing opposed the collective farm movement and denied the role of state farms. Rykov fabricated the lie of agricultural "degeneration," distorting the shrinking of the kulak economy as the shrinking of the entire agriculture. Fourth, the so-called "excessive actions" and "persuading" kulaks to sell grain - the Bukharin group opposed adopting extraordinary measures against the kulaks, advocating the use of "persuasion" to make class enemies automatically sell grain to the state. This is consistent with his absurd claims of the so-called "extinction of class struggle" and the kulaks "peacefully growing into" socialism. They exaggerated certain shortcomings in the grain purchase work as "excessive actions," hoping to stop the implementation of this correct policy by this.

The right-leaning capitulationists also used the problem of the "scissors difference" between the prices of industrial and agricultural products to falsely accuse the Party and the state of adopting a "military feudal exploitation policy" towards the peasants. In fact, the existence of this "scissors difference" is completely different from the reactionary claims of the Trotsky opposition to raise the prices of industrial products without limit and use the method of exploiting peasants to build industry. Stalin pointed out that any exploitation of peasants is incompatible with the basic principles of a socialist country. Peasants pay extra prices for industrial products, while the prices of agricultural products are lower than the cost, in order to rapidly develop industry, and the rapid development of industry is not only in the greatest interest of the country, but also the most urgent need of the peasants. This burden is affordable for the peasants because it is carried out under the conditions of continuous improvement of the peasants' material conditions. The amount of this burden is decreasing year by year due to the development of industry and agriculture. In addition, the peasants have income from personal side occupations to pay this burden. This anti-Party slander by the Bukharin group was intended to provoke the unity of the working class and the peasants and undermine the cause of socialist construction. [Note 7]

In the spring of 1928, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union expelled the party members in rural areas who colluded with the kulaks to oppose the Party. In November 1929, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution prohibiting the propaganda of right-wing viewpoints and advocated expelling Bukharin from the Central Political Bureau. The right-wing elements temporarily retreated, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union united the masses to overcome the difficulties in advancement and advanced on the road to industrialization.

V. Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance

The grain procurement difficulties and the temporary extraordinary measures for grain purchase in the spring of 1928 (later only used to deal with the kulaks) brought new threats to the worker-peasant alliance. After refuting the absurdity that some people believed that the worker-peasant alliance had been broken, Stalin pointed out that this threat to the worker-peasant alliance was not a "trivial matter."

The worker-peasant alliance under the dictatorship of the proletariat is not an alliance with all peasants, but an alliance of the working class and the working peasants. The basis of this alliance is to ensure that the proletariat leads the peasants to socialism. Therefore, in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to strengthen the education and transformation of the peasants, and it is necessary to constantly overcome the peasants' blind and spontaneous capitalist tendencies. Such an alliance cannot be realized without fighting against the capitalist elements - the kulaks - among the peasants.

In the struggle to overcome the difficulties of grain procurement, the correct guidelines and policies adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union promoted the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. If the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had implemented the claims of the representatives of the "left"-leaning danger, abandoned the New Economic Policy, turned the grain purchase work into a surplus grain requisition system, and turned the temporary "extraordinary measures" into regular methods, it would have caused conflicts with the middle peasants and destroyed the worker-peasant alliance. If the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had implemented the claims of the representatives of the right-leaning danger, unconditionally and constantly "conceding" and "flattering" the peasants, stopped developing heavy industry, stopped developing collective farms and state farms, tolerated the anti-Party behavior of the kulaks, and allowed the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie to drown everything, it would have made the cause of industrialization a failure and capitalism restored.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union opposed various erroneous and harmful tendencies towards the worker-peasant alliance, adhered to the correct Leninist general line, consolidated the union of workers and peasants, and won the victory on the grain front.

    苏联工业化初期的粮食收购困难是怎样克服的
    杨承栋
    一、粮食收购的困难和严重的后果
    苏联在实行社会主义工业化的初期，出现过粮食收购的困难。
    粮食的严重困难，是在一九二八年初发见的。可注意的情况是：（1）由于粮食生产逐年恢复，一九二六—一九二七年的产量已达到战前水平的百分之九十以上，收购粮食的困难并非由于粮食产量的减少；（2）一九二七年以前三年连续丰收，当时在购粮问题上存在着乐观的估计；（3）国家掌握的粮食，自从实行粮食税制度以来，主要靠市场的收购，几年以来，购粮不仅能够满足城市和军队的需要，而且每年能够争取有相当数量的出口粮以换取工业设备和原料（一九二五—六年度输出一亿二千三百万普特，次年度又输出一亿五千三百万普特。每普特合一六·三八公斤）。
    当时为供给城市、工业区、技术作物区、红军的需要，国家每年约需掌握五亿普特粮食。一九二八年初发现粮食严重困难，收购计划不能完成，比上年同期少购进一亿二千八百万普特粮食。由此所引起的严重情况是：由于输出计划不能完成，因而不能按计划输入必需的工业装备和原料，影响了刚开始的第一个五年计划。例如棉花亚麻不能入口，纺织部门停工减产；粮食供应不足，许多部门呈现解体状态；由于采用临时的“非常手段”购粮，发生了强迫命令现象，挨户搜索，停闭部分的地方市场，破坏了革命法律，局部地区恢复了军事共产主义时期的办法，给工农联盟带来新的威胁；最后，由于投机商人和富农操纵市场，造成恐慌，使党和国家在政治上受到很大的损害。
    二、粮食收购困难的基本原因
    粮食收购的困难，并不是单纯由于计划错误等偶然的因素，而是像斯大林所指出的，“这里困难底原因是更深刻得多的”。〔注一〕当时表现出来的是：商品粮（农民出售的粮食）的需要量增长得极快，而商品粮的数量不仅增长得极慢，甚至还有跌落下去的危险。
    商品粮的需要量为什么增长得极快？主要是工业增长了，工人数量增加着；城市增长着，城市人口每年增加百分之四（全苏联人口每年增加百分之二点三）；出产技术作物（棉、麻、糖萝卜等）的农业区增长着，这些区域不仅不产粮，还需要增加粮食的供应；最后，为了换取工业装备，争取外汇基金的增加，必须输出部分粮食。
    商品粮为什么增长得极慢？有以下几方面的原因：
      （1）革命胜利以后，农业结构由大商品经济单位（富农、地主的农庄）分散为半自给的小农经济。革命后农户数由一千六百万户变为二千四百万户。革命前地主富农在自己的粮产量中可提供百分之四十七和百分之三十四的商品粮。而小农只能提供自己粮产总量的百分之十四点七的商品粮。所以，谷物出产总量在一九二七年虽已达到战前水准百分之九十一，而谷物出产总量中的商品部分，至多也不过等于战前水准的百分之三十七，而且谷物出产总量中的商品部分还有继续低落下去的危险。〔注二〕当时的苏联还是一个小农经济占优势的国家，中农是革命后农村中的“中心人物”，国营农场和集体农庄虽然粮产量大，而且提供的商品量很高，但当时它们的粮食产量才占全国粮产量的百分之一点七，只及富农产量的八分之一，比个体农民少得更多，所以不能改变局势。斯大林说谷物业危机的出现，是由于“农业发展速度底过度落后”。〔注三〕
    （2）富农的抵抗增强了。三年的丰收，使富农积蓄了资本，正像斯大林所指出的，富农懂得“粮食不能看作平常商品”，是“宝中之宝”，它不仅可以用来盘剥贫农，而且是政治上、经济上加强富农分子的手段。〔注四〕从一九二七年起，富农公开反抗国家的价格政策，拒绝把余粮卖给国家，农村中的有余粮的富裕分子（甚至有一大批富裕的共产党员），都受富农的影响，拒绝售粮给国家。
    （3）其它特殊的原因和领导工作中的缺点：乌克兰和北高加索的冻灾和旱灾使谷物约减产三亿普特；供应农村的工业品不足、不及时；粮食收购价格过低，未比照其它商品做相应的、适当的提高；税收的错误（富裕农民税轻）；粮食消费的不当；国家不必要地担负了中小城市的粮食供应；购粮机关、合作社、党政组织工作中的缺点；挨户搜索、封闭市场造成的恐慌；投机商人和富农的破坏和捣乱等。
    商品粮供求之间发生极大矛盾，就产生了粮食收购困难。从总的看来，这是社会主义工业化事业前进中的困难，它和任何资本主义国家或殖民地国家农业衰落所引起的困难，是没有任何共同之点的。而且正因为它是前进中产生的困难，也必然随着社会主义事业的进展而得到解决。
    三、困难的克服
    经过紧张的努力，在一九二八年底初步渡过了困难。
    到了农业集体化完成以后，苏联的粮食问题便算大体上解决了。直到去年苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上，马林科夫同志才宣称粮食问题的最后解决。可见这是一个必须经过长期努力才能解决的问题。
    斯大林在“在粮食战线上”和其它文件中，指出逃出谷物业危机的出路，是发展能使用拖拉机和农业机器的、集体耕种的、社会主义大农庄（集体农庄和国营农场）。一九二八年十一月斯大林说，由于个体农民的总产量还多过集体农庄和国营农场总产量六倍，所以，当时必须大力帮助个体农民（贫农、中农）扩大收获量。
    发展和巩固集体农庄、国营农场，是解决粮食问题的根本办法。苏联共产党第十五次代表大会，根据列宁遗留的关于农业集体化的指示，通过了关于尽量开展农业集体化的决议，苏联共产党中央又决定组织能在三四年后生产出一亿普特商品粮食的国营农场（它也叫做“巨大的谷物工厂”），成立“谷物托辣斯”来执行这一决议。国家给社会化的农业大量的资金和拖拉机（到一九三○年六月，已能供给拖拉机五万五千架以上——这是当时加强农业集体化运动的物质的、技术的条件。）迅速扩大了耕地面积。一九二九年社会化农业谷物产量已达到四亿普特，所提供的商品粮超过一亿三千万普特以上，——即已超过一九二七年富农所提供的商品粮。一九二九年底，斯大林宣布以消灭富农的政策代替限制富农的政策。一九三三年，集体农庄已能交出十余亿普特粮食给国家。这即是实践和证实了斯大林所指出的，为要逃出谷物危机，不是倚靠降低工业发展速度，而是“把谷物业底发展速度提高到能够保证全部国民经济、工业与农业迅速向前发展的水平”。〔注五〕
    至于提高个体农民的粮食产量，由于在一定时期以内，个体农民在粮食和原料生产上还起着主要作用，所以国家大力帮助贫农和中农获得优良的种籽、肥料和简便的农业机器，把个体农民组织到合作社系统中去，和整个乡村订立粮食和其它农产品的预备合同，贷给他们资金和商品，加强国营农场和集体农庄对个体农民的技术上文化上的帮助。
    克服粮食收购困难的重要步骤之一是坚决向富农进攻。斯大林同志指出，对富农施用压力，挤出他们储藏得很多的剩余粮食，是国内“取得粮食的新的来源”。〔注六〕苏联共产党和苏联政府采取许多非常手段，在法律上规定如果富农和投机商人拒绝按规定价格把余粮卖给国家，得将余粮没收，又规定可把没收的富农粮食的百分之二十五给贫农享用。此外，国家对占人口百分之三的富农中最富裕的部分，加收个别税。苏联共产党坚持稳稳地倚靠贫农、巩固与中农的联盟、坚决反对富农的方针，动员贫农中农组成千百万人的政治军队，把富农的进攻打退，取得粮食战线上的胜利。
    除了以上几项基本政策之外，还采取了以下的一些重要措施：
    推广谷物和农产品的预购合同制。这一办法可以帮助贫农中农发展生产，扩大国家对农产品的收购，影响农业发展的方向。这一办法促进了农业集体化事业的发展，并使小农个体经济向计划化的轨道前进。一九二九年国家通过预购合同订购了春种谷物的百分之五十四、秋种谷物的百分之四十四、棉花的全部、糖萝卜的大部、亚麻的一半（在一九三二年即农业集体化运动获得胜利之后，采取了粮食义务交售制）。
    改进对农村工业品的供应。加强供应农村的农业生产资料和消费品的生产。发展农村合作社的系统，克服市场关系中的无政府状态，加强社会主义经济和农民的联系。为了克服对工业品的需要量的增长超过供应能力的增长的困难，国家除了制订了商品流转计划，按照各地区国民经济的意义来分配工业品以外，特别注意加强对农村的商品供应（必要时减少对城市的商品供应量），规定在收获后和购粮时期更要做好这一工作。
    实行粮食定额供给制。一九二八年末起，个别城市开始实行粮食配给制。由于这一配给制并不是生产衰落所引起的，所以，实行这一制度并不降低劳动者的生活水准，只是为了使粮食供应服从计划建设的需要。一九二九年第二季度，普遍实行粮食和糖的配给制。以后并把配给制推广到其它重要食品上去（后来还逐渐实行对某些工业品的限购和定额供应制）。
    四、向右倾投降派的斗争
    粮食困难使小资产阶级的盲目的自发势力加强了，这促进了右倾危险的发展。斯大林在一九二八年十月指出，虽然当时苏联共产党内“左”右两种倾向都存在，但右倾危险是主要的危险。
    布哈林、李可夫集团是富农在党内的代理人，他们的反动面目在进攻富农的斗争展开以后就掩藏不住了。这一集团是党内右倾机会主义集团，是走向资产阶级思想方面去的投降派集团。右倾危险的代表者，在农村基层的党组织中是一批富裕的党员，他们勾结富农反对购粮政策。各级党、政、合作社组织中、直到党中央委员当中都有右倾危险的代表者或对这种危险采取调和态度的人。当时如不克服右倾以及对右倾的调和态度，就不能克服粮食问题上的困难。
    右倾投降派是反对苏联共产党中央的总路线的。苏联共产党中央和布哈林集团的争论，在和粮食问题方面有关的，主要有以下几个问题：第一，所谓市场“常态化”和提高购粮价格问题——右倾投降派反对党的价格政策，主张取消国家对市场的调节作用，允许贸易完全自由，允许自由玩弄价格，让富农和投机商人大发其财。第二，关于工业化的速度和由国外输入粮食问题——布哈林反对用“非常手段”对付富农。他主张从国外输入粮食来解救危机。这样就要阻滞工业装备的输入，减低工业发展的速度。右倾分子本来是反对社会主义工业化的事业，主张只发展轻工业而反对着重发展重工业的方针的。第三，所谓农业“退化”问题——右派反对集体农庄运动，否认国营农场的作用。李可夫捏造农业“退化”的谎言，把富农经济的萎缩曲解为整个农业的萎缩。第四，所谓“过火行动”和“说服”富农售粮问题——布格林集团反对对富农采用非常手段，主张用“说服”的办法使阶级敌人自动售粮给国家。这和他的所谓“阶级斗争熄灭论”和富农“和平长入”社会主义的荒谬主张是一致的。他们夸大购粮工作的某点缺点为“过火行动”，希望借此停止这一正确政策的执行。
    右倾投降派还利用工农业产品价格之间的“剪刀差”问题，诬蔑党和国家对农民采取“军事封建剥削政策”。实际上，这种“剪刀差”的存在，和托洛茨基反对派所主张的无限制地抬高工业品价格、用剥削农民的方法来建设工业的反动主张完全不同。斯大林指出，对农民的任何剥削都是和社会主义国家的基本原则不相容的。农民对工业品付出超额的价格、而农产品价格则低于成本，是为了迅速发展工业，而迅速发展工业不仅是国家的最大利益，也是农民的最迫切的需要。这种负担是农民能够支付的，因为它是在农民物质状况不断改善的条件下进行的。这种负担数量正在因为工农业的发展而逐年减少。此外，农民有个人的副业的收入可以支付这种负担。布哈林集团这一反党的诬蔑是为了挑拨工人阶级和农民的团结，破坏社会主义建设事业。〔注七〕
    一九二八年春天，苏联共产党把农村中勾结富农反党的党员开除。一九二九年十一月，苏联共产党中央通过禁止右派观点的宣传，主张开除布哈林出中央政治局。右派分子便暂时退却，苏联共产党团结群众克服了前进中的困难，向工业化大路前进了。
    五、巩固工农联盟
    粮食收购困难以及一九二八年春季的购粮的临时的非常手段（后来只用于对付富农），给工农联盟带来新的威胁。斯大林在驳斥有人认为工农联盟已经破裂的无稽之后，指出这种对工农联盟的威胁并不是“不要紧的小事”。
    无产阶级专政条件下的工农联盟，不是和全体农民联盟，而是工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟。这个联盟的基础是保证无产阶级领导农民走向社会主义。所以，为了巩固工农联盟，必须加强对农民的教育和改造，必须不断克服农民的盲目的、自发的资本主义倾向。这样的联盟，不与农民中资本主义分子——富农做斗争，是不能实现的。
    在克服粮食收购困难的斗争中，苏联共产党所采取的正确的方针政策，促进了工农联盟的巩固。当时苏联共产党如果实行“左”倾危险的代表者的主张，废弃新经济政策，把购粮工作变成余粮征集制，把临时的“非常手段”变为经常的办法，就将引起和中农的冲突，使工农联盟灭亡。当时苏联共产党如果实行右倾危险的代表者的主张，向农民无原则地、不断地“让步”和“献媚”，停止发展重工业，停止发展集体农庄和国营农场，宽纵富农的反党行为，让小资产阶级自发势力淹没一切，就将使工业化事业失败，资本主义复辟。
    苏联共产党反对了各种错误的、对工农联盟有害的倾向，坚持了正确的列宁主义的总路线，便巩固了工农的联合，并在粮食战线上取得了胜利。
