Welcome Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Delegation of the Korean Government

    Friendship Forged in Blood
    Volunteer Army Veteran Returning Home for Recuperation, Sun Yi
    Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, I feel indescribably excited and moved that the delegation you are leading is visiting our country. It is a pity that I cannot walk yet, and I regret not being able to join the people of the capital in welcoming you at the station.
    The news of your upcoming visit to our country made me so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. I was thinking about those days in Korea in 1951, and about the heroic Korean people you have nurtured.

      On the night of April 22, 1951, I was seriously wounded in the Battle of Yeoncheon and was sent to the rear for treatment. As the car passed through Singye, two enemy planes swooped down and strafed the car. At this moment, two Korean villagers guarding the air defense by the mountainside rushed over and, braving the enemy's strafing, rescued me to an air-raid shelter. At that time, I was so moved that I couldn't say a word, and just tightly held the hands of the two old men. An old man named Choi comforted me in very broken Chinese, saying, "Comrade, Marshal Kim Il-sung told us that the Chinese People's Volunteers are using their lives and blood to help us fight the American bandits. Every Korean citizen should do their best to support and help the Chinese People's Volunteers." Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, these are the people with great internationalist spirit who have been educated by you.
    When our group of wounded arrived by train in Seongcheon, the railway bridge north of Seongcheon was bombed by enemy planes. We stopped in a mountain cave for three days. As soon as we stopped, more than forty Korean women came to the train to feed us, bring us water, wash our clothes, and even help the seriously wounded with their bowel movements. All of us wounded soldiers were deeply moved by their kindness. I couldn't help but shed tears, and I felt very ashamed in my heart. I felt that although I had also come to Korea to participate in several battles, what I had done was too little compared to the Korean people's love for me. At that time, an old Korean woman seemed to see my feelings and came to my side, comforting me as if she were my mother, saying, "You have shed blood for the Korean people. Our children and grandchildren will never forget you. I hope you will rest and recuperate in peace and return to the front lines soon." The old woman also told me that her two sons had responded to your call and joined the People's Army, and her daughter was working in the myeon (district) committee. She and the women in the village were farming together at home, cultivating and harvesting at night to avoid enemy bombing during the day, and not letting a single piece of land go to waste.... The old woman's words not only made me feel a motherly warmth and affection, but also made me feel how brave and hardworking the Korean people are! Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, these are the enlightened Korean people under your guidance. This is an important guarantee for the victory of the Korean anti-aggression war, and also a guarantee that Korea will be built even stronger and more beautiful in the future.
    Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, your visit to our country with the delegation will further develop and consolidate the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged in blood. I respectfully wish you and all the comrades of the delegation good health. I will rest and recuperate in peace, strive to recover my health as soon as possible, and return to the front lines or take up a job in the construction of the motherland, and strive for the complete victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, and for lasting world peace.

### 鲜血结成的友谊

专栏：欢迎金日成元帅和朝鲜政府代表团

    鲜血结成的友谊
    志愿军归国休养员  孙毅
    敬爱的金日成元帅，您率领的代表团来我国访问了，我心里有说不出的兴奋和激动。可惜我暂时还不能走路，没有和首都人民一起到车站去欢迎您，实在感到遗憾。
    听到您要来我国的消息，使我激动得整夜没有入睡。我在想一九五一年在朝鲜的那些日子，我在想被您教导出来的英雄的朝鲜人民。
      一九五一年四月二十二日夜，我在涟川战斗中负了重伤，被送到后方去治疗，当汽车通过新溪时，两架敌机俯冲下来，对着汽车扫射，这时两位在山边防空的朝鲜老乡急忙跑来，冒着敌机的扫射把我抢救到防空洞里。当时我感动得一句话都说不出来，只是紧紧地握住两位老大伯的手。一位姓崔的老大伯用很生涩的中国话安慰我说：“同志，金日成元帅跟我们说过，中国人民志愿军用生命和鲜血援助我们打击美国强盗，每个朝鲜公民应以全力支援和帮助中国人民志愿军。”敬爱的金日成元帅，这就是在您教导之下具有伟大的国际主义精神的人民。
    当我们这批伤员乘火车到达成川的时候，成川以北的铁桥被敌机炸断了，我们就在山洞里停了三天，刚刚停下，就有四十多个朝鲜妇女，来到列车上给我们又是喂饭，又是送水，又是洗衣服，甚至还帮助重伤员倒大小便。我们全体伤员都被她们这种友爱深深感动，我不禁流下泪来，我内心里感到十分惭愧，我觉得自己虽也来到朝鲜参加了几次战役，但比起朝鲜人民对自己的热爱，自己做的事实在太少了。当时，一位朝鲜老妈妈好像看出了我的心情，便走近我的身边来，安慰似地说：“你们为朝鲜人民流了血，我们子孙万代忘不了你们，希望你们安心休养，早日回到前线来。”这位老妈妈还告诉我，她的两个儿子都响应您的号召参加了人民军，女儿也在面（区）委员会里工作，她在家中和村里的妇女们一块种地，白天为了躲避敌机轰炸，她们就在夜里耕种和收割，没有让一块土地荒废……。老妈妈的话，除了使我感到母亲般的亲切和温暖，还使我感到朝鲜人民是多么勇敢、勤劳啊！敬爱的金日成元帅，这就是在您教导下觉悟了的朝鲜人民，这就是朝鲜反侵略战争所以能够取胜的重要保证，也是朝鲜将来一定会建设得更强大更美丽的保证。
    敬爱的金日成元帅，您和代表团来我国，将使用鲜血结成的中朝人民的伟大友谊，得到进一步的发展和巩固。我敬祝您和代表团的全体同志身体健康。我一定安心休养，争取早日恢复健康，重回前线或走上建设祖国的工作岗位，为争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利，为祖国的繁荣和富强，为世界持久和平而奋斗。
