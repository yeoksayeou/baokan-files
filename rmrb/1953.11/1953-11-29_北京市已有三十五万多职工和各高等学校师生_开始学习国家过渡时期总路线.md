In Beijing, the broad masses of workers and staff began studying the general line of the state during the transition period in mid-November. To date, more than 350,000 employees have heard reports on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and most employees have also conducted discussions. Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in some factories and mines have listened to five or six reports. Many employees have also automatically gone to bookstores to buy relevant documents on the general line for study.

After starting to study the general line, the broad masses of workers and staff were not only encouraged by the bright future of the motherland, but also further realized the important responsibility of the working class in implementing the general line of the state. Therefore, they have expressed their determination to improve production, earnestly economize, actively learn technology, and contribute all their strength to the cause of the state's socialist industrialization. Ma Yinhe, head of the electrical repair workshop of the power department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, is determined to change the passive state of repair work in the past and prepare to lead the workers of the entire workshop to implement a "regular maintenance system" in a step-by-step manner. He plans to repair all water pumps and motors within six months to ensure the safe operation of hydropower machinery, sufficient water supply, and smooth power generation, so that the blast furnace can produce more iron and build more machines, so that socialism can be realized at an early date. Li Kezuo, chief engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant and a model worker in North China, felt a great responsibility after studying the general line. He said: "Every bit more work we do every day brings us one step closer to socialism; every bit more production we increase adds a bit more socialist component." He and the technicians and workers of the entire factory are working together to revise the design drawings of the "Bukoff Waterwheel," the rocker harvester, and other equipment based on the opinions of the farmers, in order to supply farmers with better quality new agricultural tools and produce more grain and industrial raw materials. Zhao Wujun, a young worker at the Beijing Garment Factory, found a trick to "keep the machine running," which increased the production efficiency of the entire work section by 16%. After studying the general line this time, he came up with a trick of placing the brim and top of the hat on both sides when making hats, so that eight hours of work can be completed in just over six hours. By the 22nd, he had completed the November production plan ahead of schedule. Yao Zonglin, a worker at Factory 546, said when talking about the reasons for his increased production: "I used to stop thinking of ways after making two pipes. After studying the general line, I know that the realization of socialism is related to everyone's work, and if everyone does a good job, socialism can come sooner, so I try to overcome difficulties and think of ways."

Xinhua News Agency: In addition, teachers, students and staff of various universities in Beijing started to study the general line of the state during the transition period in mid-November.

After the study began, the presidents (deans) of most schools have conveyed the report on the Party's general line during the transition period to the entire school. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the Teachers' Study Committee, and the Trade Union, each school formulated study plans for teachers, students, and staff, and designated relevant study documents on the general line. Teachers also selected Lenin and Stalin's works on state capitalism and the New Economic Policy as study reference documents. Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Petroleum Institute and other schools also held seminars to discuss issues related to the general line.

After listening to the report on the general line and studying some related documents, the teachers, students, and staff of various schools felt very excited and connected their work with the general line. They felt that the general line is like a radiant lighthouse, which not only illuminates the country's economic construction work, but also illuminates the work of universities.

After studying the general line, teachers, students, and staff all felt that they had not only gained many new understandings, but also clarified many past vague concepts and erroneous ideas. For example, on the issues of the country's socialist industrialization, the transformation of private capitalism, and how to guide farmers to gradually move towards socialism, and the worker-peasant alliance, everyone's understanding was not very clear in the past, but now they have a clearer understanding.

The teachers all felt that the direction of teaching work was clearer, and their work enthusiasm was greatly improved. They expressed that they must work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, do a good job in teaching, do a good job in unity, and better cultivate talents for national construction. At the seminar on the study of the general line held at Beijing Institute of Geology, teachers conducted discussions in connection with teaching work. They clearly realized that their task is important and that they must cultivate geological talents, the vanguards on the industrial construction front, in accordance with the needs of national industrialization. Chen Guangyuan, deputy director of the Mineral Crystallization Teaching and Research Section, said: "I feel very happy to live in the era of Mao Zedong. We will always move in the direction of progress."

The students all felt very excited, and their enthusiasm for learning was even greater. They expressed that they would demand more strictly of themselves, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's call for "good health, good study, and good work," study hard, prepare their strength, and serve the country's socialist industrialization construction. Teng Tingkang of Beijing Normal University said: "The country's first five-year construction plan places the cultivation of talents in a very important position. I am studying physics, and I will train more talents in the future to engage in industrial construction. Studying the general line has increased my confidence in learning." Students from Beijing Petroleum Institute expressed their determination to study hard and become excellent cadres for petroleum industrial construction. Chen Jiancun, a third-year student majoring in refinery machinery in the Department of Mechanics, said: "I will study hard so that I can exert the greatest strength in the construction of the country's petroleum industry."

The staff comrades of various schools also expressed that they would cooperate with the school's teaching work with a positive and responsible spirit, do their own work well, and respond to the call of the administration to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    北京市已有三十五万多职工和各高等学校师生
    开始学习国家过渡时期总路线
    北京市的广大职工群众在十一月中旬先后开始学习国家在过渡时期的总路线。到目前为止，有三十五万多职工已经听了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的传达报告，大部分职工并进行了讨论。有些厂矿中的共产党员和青年团员听了五六次报告。许多职工并自动到书店里买有关总路线的文件来学习。
    广大职工在开始学习总路线以后，不但为祖国的美好前途所鼓舞，而且进一步认识到工人阶级在贯彻国家总路线中所担负的重大责任。因而他们纷纷表示要搞好生产，认真节约，积极学好技术，把一切力量都贡献给国家社会主义工业化的事业。石景山钢铁厂动力部电器修理工场场长马印和决心要改变过去修理工作上的被动状态，准备带领全场工人有步骤地实行“定期检修制”。他计划在六个月内把全部的水泵、马达修理一遍，让水电机器安全运转，足够地供水，顺利地发电，让高炉多出铁，好多造机器，使得社会主义早日实现。华北农业机械总厂总工程师、华北区劳动模范李克佐学习了总路线后，深感自己责任重大。他说：“我们每天多作一点工作，就多接近社会主义一步；多增加一点生产，就多增加一点社会主义成分。”他和全厂的技术人员和工人们在一起，正在根据农民提出的意见，修改“布可夫水车”、摇臂收割机等设计图样，以便供应农民质地更好的新式农具，生产更多的粮食和工业原料。北京被服厂青年工人赵武俊曾找到“不停机器”的窍门，使全工段的生产效率提高了百分之十六。这次他学习总路线以后，又想出了在做帽子时把帽沿、帽顶分两边放置的窍门，使八小时的工作在六小时多时间内就完成。到二十二日，他已提前完成了十一月份的生产计划。五四六工厂工人姚宗林讲到自己生产提高的原因时说：“以前我做两个管子就不再想办法了。学习总路线以后，知道实现社会主义和每个人的工作都有关系，每个人都做好工作，社会主义就可以早日到来，我就努力克服困难，想办法了。”　（新华社）
    又讯：北京各高等学校教师、学生和职工已于十一月中旬开始学习国家在过渡时期的总路线。
    学习开始后，多数学校的校（院）长已向全校传达了党在过渡时期总路线的报告。各校并在党委、教师学习委员会和工会的领导下，制订了教师、学生及职工的学习计划，指定了有关总路线的学习文件。教师们还选择了列宁、斯大林论国家资本主义和新经济政策的著作，作为学习参考文件。中国人民大学、清华大学、北京地质学院、北京石油学院等校并召开了座谈会，讨论总路线的有关问题。
    各校师生、职工在听了总路线的报告和学习了一些有关文件以后，都感到非常兴奋，把自己的工作和总路线联系起来。他们觉得，总路线像一座光芒四射的灯塔，它不仅照耀着国家的经济建设工作，也同样地照耀着高等学校的工作。
    教师、学生、职工在学习了总路线以后，都感觉到自己不仅增加了许多新的认识，而且澄清了过去的许多模糊观念和错误思想。譬如，对国家社会主义工业化问题、私人资本主义的改造问题，以及如何引导农民逐步走向社会主义问题，工农联盟问题等，过去大家认识都不很清楚，但现在都认识得比较明确了。
    教师们都感到教学工作的方向更加明确了，大大提高了工作热情。他们表示今后一定要努力学习苏联，搞好教学，搞好团结，更好地培养国家建设人材。在北京地质学院召开的总路线学习座谈会上，教师结合教学工作进行了讨论。他们清楚地认识到自己的任务是重大的，必须根据国家工业化的需要，相应地培养工业建设战线上的尖兵——地质人材。矿物结晶教研室副主任陈光远说：“生活在毛泽东的时代，我感到非常幸福，我们将永远朝着前进的方向走去。”
    学生们都感到非常兴奋，学习劲头更大了。他们表示要更严格地要求自己，坚决贯彻毛主席“身体好，学习好，工作好”的号召，努力学习，准备力量，为祖国社会主义工业化建设服务。北京师范大学滕庭康说：“国家第一个五年建设计划，把培养人材放在很重要的地位。我是学物理的，将来要培养更多的人材，从事工业建设。学习了总路线，提高了我的学习信心。”北京石油学院同学表示，决心学好功课，成为优秀的石油工业建设干部。机械系炼厂机械专业三年级同学陈建存说：“我要努力学习，使自己能够在祖国石油工业建设中发挥最大的力量。”
    各校职工同志们也表示要以积极负责的精神，配合学校的教学工作，做好本身的工作；并响应行政方面的号召，开展增产节约运动。
