Title: The Uncoordinated Phenomenon Between State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives in Echeng Must Be Corrected

    The relationship between state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Echeng County, Hubei Province, has long been uncoordinated. Both sides start from a purely profit-making point of view in purchasing, sales, and other businesses, and exclude each other, so that illegal private merchants take the opportunity to engage in activities. This not only weakens the leading role of the state-owned economy but also reduces the prestige of cooperatives among the masses.
    The commercial network of cooperatives in the county is quite strong. For the purchase of many agricultural and sideline products, the state-owned commercial departments could have entrusted the cooperatives to purchase them on their behalf through consultation. However, some state-owned commercial departments in the county did not do so, and when they saw that a certain product was selling well and profitable, they would rush to purchase it with the cooperatives. For example, in the Nanfeng District of the county, supply and marketing cooperatives and distribution stores are all over the large, medium, and small market towns, but the purchasing group of the state-owned store in the district, in order to compete with the cooperatives for the market, actually entrusted private merchants to purchase on their behalf and gave priority to providing some funds to the private merchants, thus fostering the speculative behavior of some illegal merchants. For example, Zhang Xuheng and other seven people in Donggou Town opened three trading houses. They only signed a contract with the state-owned store in the name of "Tongli Trading House" to purchase sesame and lotus seeds. However, these three trading houses used the name of the state-owned store and embezzled state funds to purchase a variety of products, and privately transported the lotus seeds purchased on behalf of the state-owned store to Hankou for sale to make huge profits. In one instance, they sold more than 3,400 catties of lotus seeds to the private merchant Lianli Trading House. These illegal merchants also used the guise of purchasing and selling on behalf of state-owned stores to evade state taxes and deceive farmers. For example, Zhang Xuheng and others went to the countryside to promote sales twice, with sales amounting to more than 10.89 million yuan. They should have paid a business tax of 16 percent, but because they used the guise of purchasing and selling on behalf of the state-owned store, they paid taxes at the rate of 5 percent for resident merchants, evading more than 1 million yuan in taxes. Yu Yunqing, a private merchant in Tujianao, also intercepted and lowered prices to grab farmers' soybeans, saying, "I am buying on behalf of the state-owned store." In addition, the Echeng state-owned store also used the method of raising purchase prices to compete with the cooperatives for the market. For example, the original listed price of sesame in Gedian was 178,000 yuan per 100 catties, but the Gedian purchasing group of the state-owned store raised the price to 190,000 yuan per 100 catties without the approval of the county finance committee, causing many farmers to ask the cooperatives to return the sesame after they had sold it to the cooperatives, creating market chaos.
    Some state-owned stores also have a purely profit-making point of view in the wholesale business with cooperatives. For example, in June and July, a large amount of rapeseed oil was on the market, resulting in sluggish sales. The state-owned oil and fat company did not accept it. The rapeseed oil purchased by the cooperatives could not be stored, so they promoted the sale of more than 300,000 catties of rapeseed oil to other places. In August, when the market lacked rapeseed sources and the supply of rapeseed oil was difficult, the oil and fat company refused to wholesale to the cooperatives on the grounds that the cooperatives had sold rapeseed oil to other places, making it impossible for the cooperatives to supply the needs of the members. When the Jinniao business department of the department store wholesaled brown sugar, because the cooperative wanted to deduct a 3 percent preferential discount, the Jinniao business department would rather wholesale the brown sugar to private merchants than to cooperatives. The manager of the business department also said to the local cooperative manager: "There will be no more preferential treatment in the future." This seriously violated the policy that state-owned commercial goods should be wholesale to cooperatives first.
    Cooperatives also have serious purely profit-making ideas in purchasing and supply. When purchasing wheat, the county cooperative federation purchased 60,000 catties of wheat on behalf of the private Xin Jian Flour Mill, and stopped the business of purchasing on behalf of the state-owned grain departments in Tanjiaqiao and other places. In order to make more money, they also raised the price of the wheat purchased on behalf of the state and sold it to private merchants. More seriously, some cadres of the district supply and marketing cooperatives were unwilling for cadres of state-owned stores to purchase in their districts, and even used the names of the district offices and cooperative members to notify state-owned stores to withdraw their purchasing groups from the districts, which made the relationship between cooperatives and state-owned stores worse and worse.
    The main reason for the above-mentioned phenomenon is that the cadres of the county's cooperatives and state-owned commerce lack policy awareness and mistakenly believe that cooperatives and state-owned commerce are like private merchants opening shops. They reduce themselves to ordinary merchants, and thus each starts from a profit-making point of view and excludes each other. This is a serious manifestation of capitalist business thinking. The above-mentioned problems have attracted the attention of the Echeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, which has strengthened the leadership over state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce and has taken a number of effective measures to correct them.

    鄂城国营商业和合作社不协调现象要纠正
    湖北省鄂城县国营商业部门和合作社的关系，长期存在不协调的现象，双方在购销等业务上均从单纯营利观点出发，互相排斥，以致不法私商乘机活动。这既削弱了国营经济的领导作用，也降低了合作社在群众中的威信。
    该县合作社的商业网相当强大，很多农副产品的收购，国营商业部门本来可通过协商方式委托合作社代购，可是该县的某些国营商业部门却不这样做，看见那种产品畅销利大就和合作社抢购。如该县南风区，区供销社及分销店遍布各中小集镇，而国营商店的该区收购组，为了与合作社争夺市场，竟委托私商代购，并优先交给私商一部分资金，因而助长了一些不法商人的投机行为。如东沟镇张绪恒等七人开设三个交易行，他们只以“同利行”名义和国营商店签订了代购芝麻和莲籽两种产品的合同；但这三个交易行却利用国营商店的名义，盗用国家资金收购了多种产品，并把代国营商店收购的莲籽私自运至汉口出卖，牟取暴利，其中一次卖给私商联立行的莲籽就有三千四百多斤。这些不法商人还利用代国营商店购销作幌子来偷漏国税和欺骗农民。如张绪恒等两次下乡推销，卖钱额共达一千零八十九万多元，应纳百分之十六的行商税，但因利用代国营商店购销作幌子，却按坐商百分之五纳税，共偷税一百多万元。涂家恼私商余云清还拦路压价抢购农民的黄豆，并说：“我是代国营商店买的”。此外，鄂城国营商店还利用抬高收购价格的办法与合作社争夺市场。如葛店芝麻牌价原是每百斤十七万八千元，但国营商店葛店收购组未经县财委批准擅自提价每百斤十九万元，使许多农民把芝麻卖给合作社后又要求合作社退还，造成了市场的混乱现象。
    某些国营商店对合作社的批发业务，也存在单纯的营利观点。如六、七月菜油大量上市，形成滞销，国营油脂公司不收，合作社收购来的菜油因储存不下，就把收购来的三十多万斤菜油向外地推销；到了八月间，市场菜籽来源缺乏，菜油供应困难，油脂公司却以合作社曾把菜油外销为藉口而拒绝批发给合作社，使合作社不能供应社员需要。百货商店金牛营业所批发红糖时，因合作社要扣除百分之三的优待折扣，金牛营业所就宁肯把红糖批发给私商而不批发给合作社。该营业所经理还对当地的合作社经理说：“以后不给优待。”严重的违反了国营商业商品应首先批发给合作社的政策。
    合作社在收购和供应方面也存有严重的单纯营利思想。县合作总社在收购小麦时为私营新建面粉厂代购小麦六万斤，而停止了谭家桥等地代国营粮食部门收购的业务。为了多赚钱，还把代购的小麦提价卖给私商。更严重的是，有的区供销社干部不愿国营商店干部到自己区里收购，竟利用区公所和社员代表的名义通知国营商店撤销在区里的收购组，致使合作社和国营商店的关系越来越坏。
    产生上述这种现象的主要原因，是该县合作社与国营商业的干部缺乏政策观念，错误地认为合作社和国营商业是像私商开铺子一样，把自己降低到普通的商人，因而各自从营利观点出发，互相排斥，这是一种严重的资本主义经营思想的表现。以上这些问题，已引起了中共鄂城县委的重视，加强了对国营商业与合作社商业的领导，并已采取了若干有效的措施进行纠正。　（胡吉祥）
