To the respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise and correct leadership, our country is victoriously carrying out the three major tasks of 1953, and victoriously transitioning from the period of national economic recovery to the period of planned national economic construction. Just as the people of the whole country are following the general line and general task for the transition period of the state that you have instructed, and striving to achieve the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, the China Democratic National Construction Association is holding a plenary meeting of the General Association Committee in the capital. We hereby extend our highest respect to you on behalf of all members!

At this meeting, we studied the general line and general task for the transition period of the state that you have instructed, thereby clarifying the future work direction and central task of our association. We also reviewed the past work and decided on the focus of future work. We unanimously resolved to: through the transformation of private industry and commerce, the increase in production and thrift, and various patriotic movements, rely on the efforts of all members to cultivate and improve members of our association who are industrialists and businessmen to become backbone members in the industrial and commercial circles, that is, to make them first and foremost truly patriotic and law-abiding, actively improve production and operation, study diligently, conscientiously accept socialist transformation, loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and closely link and unite the masses of industrial and commercial circles, correctly play a leading, exemplary role and the role of a bridge between the People's Government and the industrial and commercial circles, and strive to implement the general line for the transition period of the state!

With excitement and gratitude, we respectfully wish you eternal health!
