Hoping That All Enterprise Departments Value Railway Transportation Plans

Xu Jianji, Director of the Transportation Planning Department of the Ministry of Railways

Railway transportation plans and national economic plans have a close organic connection, acting as a conveyor belt between production and consumption sectors. Therefore, the completion of transportation plans is of great significance in ensuring the completion of production and capital construction plans of other enterprise departments.

This year is the first year of our country's planned economic construction. As reflected in railway transportation, the number of freight cars loaded has rapidly increased, and freight ton-kilometers have increased as well. From January to September, the actual national railway loading performance was 117.3 percent of the same period last year. In particular, the transportation of building materials has increased even more. From January to September, the actual loading performance increased by 87.9 percent compared to the same period last year. The recently launched nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy, the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production, and the more active urban-rural trade have promoted an unprecedented increase in freight volume in October, requiring the railway to over-load nearly two million tons of materials in October compared to the annual plan, becoming the highest record in the history of the People's Railways.

As freight volume has rapidly increased, and railway transportation capacity cannot be relatively enhanced in the short term, an incompatibility has arisen between the national economy's demand for transportation and the existing transportation capacity, resulting in many difficulties in current railway transportation. Based on the development situation, it is expected that this transportation difficulty will be relatively long-term and continuous. To solve this problem, in addition to appropriately enhancing necessary equipment, the key lies in fully utilizing transportation potential and further improving transportation efficiency. But how to utilize transportation potential and improve transportation efficiency? Primarily, all railway transportation departments must establish the idea of serving the national economy and strengthen the planning and organization of transportation. Some railway transportation units have not yet achieved this. They do not actively help enterprise departments do a good job in transportation work, and they do not proactively take care of the difficulties of cargo owners. Some simply load materials regardless of importance in order to make up the number of cars loaded, and blindly load without a plan, thus failing to complete the transportation plan for major materials and affecting the work of other enterprise departments. When investigating and analyzing the situation of freight sources and freight flows, they do not pay attention to studying the laws of national economic development, so the work is sloppy in the audit plan, lacks a scientific basis, and often includes car request plans without reliable freight sources into the transportation plan; while reducing the transportation plans for some major materials with reliable freight sources. This not only wastes transportation capacity but also delays the transportation of major materials. Because they have not scientifically investigated and analyzed the situation of equipment utilization, some railway transportation units still cannot accurately know how much transportation capacity they have, so they feel unsure about fully utilizing transportation capacity. They do not pay enough attention to the maintenance and repair of locomotives, vehicles, and lines. Poor locomotive quality and declining line quality also affect the improvement of transportation capacity. In the work of traffic organization, vehicles are not used rationally, the dwell time of vehicles is too long, and the turnover of vehicles cannot be accelerated. All these shortcomings hinder the improvement of planning and hinder the increase of transportation efficiency.

However, in strengthening transportation planning and fully utilizing transportation capacity, in addition to mainly requiring the railway system to overcome the shortcomings in transportation work, we also hope that all enterprise departments will value railway transportation plans. Since the People's Daily published a short commentary on strengthening railway transportation planning on June 30, transportation planning has been somewhat improved. The actual completion of planned cargo in July increased by 1.6 percent compared to June; the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Forestry have reorganized and strengthened their transportation institutions, and the phenomenon of timber transportation falling through has decreased. However, changes in plans and temporary car requests are still quite frequent. According to statistics, from May to September this year, the Ministry of Railways alone handled 661 cases, totaling 74,234 cars. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leaders of some enterprise departments do not pay enough attention to transportation plans. It is understood that some units believe that "transportation plans are a burden," and "without a plan, they can still ask the leader to write a letter of introduction to solve the problem." Recently, after the start of the increase production and practice economy movement in various places, many coal mines have produced a large amount of coal on the ground because they did not consider transportation in advance, and it could not be transported out in time. In the future, as transportation will gradually become tense and heavy, we hope that all enterprise departments will promptly prepare car request plans with definite freight sources in accordance with regulations, promptly arrange them to grassroots units after the plan is approved, and frequently supervise and inspect their completion.

When formulating transportation plans, all enterprise departments must anticipate the current relative shortage of railway transportation capacity in our country and use transportation tools rationally. They should minimize excessively long-distance, counter-current, duplicate, and other unreasonable transportation, firmly grasp the principle of obtaining materials nearby, and implement reasonable zonal supply; refer to geographical conditions and the characteristics of various transportation tools, correctly allocate freight flows; widely adopt the exchange of the same kind of products among departments, and fully utilize the volume and carrying capacity of transportation tools. At present, the phenomenon of unreasonable use of railway transportation is quite serious, such as short-distance transportation, especially in-station handling, and the counter-current of goods are still common. Goods that can be transported by waterway have not been removed from railway transportation. Due to inaccurate calculations by capital construction departments, after the completion of the project, there is often a large amount of timber and cement left, requiring unnecessary duplicate transportation.

In railway transportation, some enterprise departments do not have transportation plans, and some enterprise departments cannot accurately implement their plans even if they have them, often causing railway transportation plans to fall through. The serious failure of the Northeast timber transportation plan in April and May was also due to the fact that the forestry department did not consider the on-site timber situation and the related transportation issues when deciding on the timber allocation plan. Implementing a unified delivery system by the production department is an effective measure to fundamentally solve this problem. According to the experience of implementing the delivery system for several industrial products in the Northeast, the transportation planning of products implementing the delivery system can be increased by 5 to 10 percent, and it can achieve balanced transportation, balanced production, accelerate turnover, and save funds. At the same time, it is also possible to consider the balance of production and sales, eliminate counter-current transportation, shorten transportation mileage, and improve transportation efficiency.

From the above, it can be seen that all enterprise departments that use railway transportation have many arduous tasks in cooperating with the work of planned transportation. The railway is a highly centralized enterprise, which centrally commands tens of thousands of vehicles to operate rhythmically on more than 20,000 kilometers of railway lines across the country. It sincerely hopes that all enterprise departments will give close cooperation, establish and improve transportation institutions adapted to their own businesses, understand transportation business, jointly do a good job in planned transportation, and ensure the completion of national transportation tasks.

    希望各企业部门重视铁路运输计划
    铁道部运输计划处处长　徐建基
    铁路运输计划与国民经济计划有着密切的有机联系，它起着生产和销费部门间的传送带作用。因此运输计划的完成，对于保证其他企业部门的生产和基本建设计划的完成，有其重要的意义。
    今年为我国有计划经济建设的第一年。体现在铁路运输上的是货物装车数的迅速增长，货运吨公里的增加，一至九月全国铁路装车实绩为去年同期的百分之一一七点三。特别是建筑材料的运输增加更多。一至九月装车实绩，比去年同期增加百分之八七点九。最近全国范围内开展的增产节约运动，工农业生产不断增长，城乡贸易更呈活跃，促成十月份货源空前增加，要求铁路于十月份内比年度计划超装近二百万吨物资，成为人民铁路有史以来的最高纪录。
    货源迅速增长了，而铁路运输能力却不能于短期内相对的增强，因此产生了国民经济对运输的要求与现有运输能力间的不相适应的情况，造成了目前铁路运输的许多困难。根据发展情况，预计目前这种运输困难，将会是比较长期而带有连续性的。为解决这个问题，除适当的增强必要的设备外，其关键在于充分发挥运输潜力，进一步提高运输效率。但怎样发挥运输潜力、提高运输效率呢？主要地是各铁路运输部门必须树立起为国民经济服务的思想，加强运输的计划性和组织性。目前有些铁路运输单位还没有做到这一点。他们不积极地帮助各企业部门做好运输工作，不主动地照顾货主困难。有的单纯地为了凑足装车数，不分轻重地装运物资，不按计划地盲目乱装，因而未完成主要物资的运输计划，影响其他企业部门的工作。在调查和分析货源、货流的情况时，未注意研究国民经济发展的规律，所以在审核计划中，工作草率，缺少科学的根据，往往把没有可靠货源的要车计划，列入运输计划；而把一些有可靠货源的主要物资的运输计划削减了。这样不但浪费了运输能力，而且耽误了主要物资的运输。由于未曾科学地调查和分析设备利用的情况，有些铁路运输单位还不能确切地知道运输能力有多大，以致在充分发挥运输能力上，感到没有把握。对于机车、车辆和线路的保养和维修工作，重视不够。机车质量不良，线路质量下降，也影响了运输能力的提高。在行车组织工作上，未能合理地使用车辆，车辆停留时间过长，不能加速车辆的周转。所有这些缺点，都阻碍了计划性的提高，妨害了运输效率的增加。
    但是在加强运输计划性、充分发挥运输能力中，除了主要地要求铁路系统克服运输工作中的缺点而外，还要希望各企业部门重视铁路的运输计划。自六月三十日人民日报发表关于加强铁路运输计划性的短评后，运输计划性已有所提高，七月份计划内货物完成实绩比六月份提高百分之一点六；重工业部、林业部重新调整和加强了运输机构，木材运输落空现象减少。但目前计划的变更和临时要车还是相当频繁的。据统计今年五至九月仅铁道部集中处理的即达六百六十一件，共七万四千二百三十四车。造成这种现象的主要原因在于部分企业部门的领导上对运输计划还不够重视，据了解有些单位认为“运输计划是一种负担”，“没有计划照样可以请首长写介绍信来解决”。最近各地增产节约运动开始后，不少煤矿由于事先没有考虑运输，以致大量产煤落地，不能及时运出。在今后运输将渐趋紧张繁重的情况下，我们希望各企业部门按照规定及时编造有确切货源的要车计划，计划批准后迅速布置到基层单位，并经常督促检查其完成情况。
    各企业部门在制订运输计划时，一定要预计到目前我国铁路运输能力的相对不足的情况，合理地使用运输工具。尽量减少过远、对流、重复及其他不合理的运输，紧紧掌握就近取材的原则，实行合理分区供应；参照地理条件及各种交通工具的特点，正确地分配货流；在各部门间广泛地采用同种产品交换工作，和充分利用运输工具的容积和载重力。目前不合理使用铁路运输的现象是相当严重的，如过短距离运输，特别是站内搬运以及货物对流现象还很多。可以利用水路运输的货物，没有从铁路运输上剔出去。由于基本建设部门的计算不准确，工程完毕之后，经常剩有大批木料和水泥，需要不应有的重复运输。
    在铁路运输中，有些企业部门没有运输计划，有些企业部门虽有计划又不能准确执行，常常使得铁路运输计划落空。四、五月份东北木材运输计划的严重落空，亦为林业部门决定木材调拨计划时没有考虑现场木材情况，以及与此有关的运输问题所致。实行由生产部门统一送货制度是根本解决这一问题的有效措施，根据东北实行数种工业产品送货制度的经验证明，实行了送货制的产品运输计划性可提高百分之五至百分之十，并可达到平衡运输、平衡生产，加速周转，节约资金。同时也就有可能来考虑产销平衡，消灭对流运输，缩短运输里程，提高运输效率。
    由上可见，一切使用铁路运输的企业部门，在配合做好计划运输的工作上，有着许多繁重的任务。铁路是具有高度集中性的企业，它集中指挥着数万车辆有节奏地运行在全国二万多公里的铁路线上，十分希望各企业部门给予密切的配合，并建立和健全与本身业务相适应的运输机构，了解运输业务，共同做好计划运输工作，保证国家运输任务的完成。
