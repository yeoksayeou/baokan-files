Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 31st: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on October 30th to continue discussing the so-called "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by United Nations Forces."

    The representatives of Thailand and Colombia repeated the U.S. representative’s slanders against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and stated that they would vote against the Soviet proposal.

    Ukrainian representative L. Palamarchuk, in his speech, requested that the United Nations General Assembly adopt the Soviet proposal, inviting all countries that have not participated in or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol to participate in or ratify this protocol.

    Next, Soviet representative Malik spoke. He pointed out that the delegations of the countries participating in the armed intervention in Korea were trying to defend the U.S. military command's heinous war methods against the Korean people. Malik said that the lies spread by the U.S. military authorities that captured American pilots were forced to confess to conducting germ warfare under "pressure" and "torture" have been refuted by these American pilots themselves. Malik also said that the most reactionary groups in the United States are trying to use the repatriated American prisoners of war to instigate the Cold War. For this purpose, the U.S. military authorities have adopted a special system of so-called "brainwashing," using various methods shamelessly advocated by McCarthy and his ilk to influence the repatriated prisoners of war.

    Malik refuted the arguments of some representatives who said that China and North Korea opposed an impartial investigation into the use of bacteriological weapons. Malik cited the telegrams from the Chinese and North Korean governments to the United Nations, pointing out that China and North Korea requested to participate in the discussion but received no response. Malik pointed out that some representatives opposed the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation but did not openly reject it. They wanted to achieve their goals indirectly. Their suggestion was to submit the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for consideration. They attempted to submit this proposal to the Disarmament Commission and then shelve it. The Soviet delegation firmly insisted that the Soviet proposal be submitted to the Political Committee and the United Nations General Assembly for review and voting. The General Assembly itself can and should take a decision on this issue.

    Subsequently, the Political Committee began discussing the voting procedure for the various proposals. The British representative suggested that the five-nation proposal be voted on first. Malik opposed this suggestion. He said that this was an attempt by some countries, including Britain, to avoid a vote on the Soviet proposal in the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet representative firmly insisted that the Soviet proposal be voted on first because the Soviet proposal was submitted for review first. The representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia spoke in support of the Soviet delegation's request.

    联大政委会继续讨论关于美国抵赖进行细菌战的提案
    马立克坚决主张联大应首先表决苏联提案
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月三十日举行会议，继续讨论所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”。
    泰国和哥伦比亚的代表，重复美国代表对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的诽谤，并表示，他们将投票反对苏联的提案。
    乌克兰代表勒·帕拉马尔楚克在他的发言中要求联合国大会通过苏联提案，邀请一切没有参加或批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家参加或批准这个议定书。
    接着，苏联代表马立克发言。他指出，参加武装干涉朝鲜的各国代表团竭力为美军司令部对朝鲜人民使用罪恶滔天的战争方法作辩护。马立克说，美国军事当局所散布的被俘美国飞行员在“压力”和“酷刑”之下被迫供认进行细菌战的谰言，已经被这些美国飞行员自己所驳倒了。马立克还说，美国最反动的集团竭力利用遣返回国的美国战俘来煽动冷战。为了这种目的，美国军事当局采用了一种所谓“洗脑筋”的特别制度，用麦卡锡之流所无耻鼓吹的各种各样的方法来影响已被遣返的战俘。
    马立克反驳某些代表的论调，他们说中朝两国反对公正调查关于使用细菌武器的问题。马立克举出了中朝两国政府致联合国的电报，并指出，中朝两国要求参加讨论，但没有得到回答。马立克指出，某些代表反对苏联代表团提出的提案，但并不公然地拒绝它。他们想以间接的方法来达到他们的目的。他们提出的建议是：把苏联提案提交联合国裁减军备委员会审议。他们企图把这个提案提交到裁减军备委员会，随后束之高阁。苏联代表团坚决主张，把苏联提案提交政治委员会和联合国大会审查，并进行表决。联大本身能够而且应该对这个问题采取决定。
    随后，政治委员会开始讨论各项提案的表决程序。英国代表建议五国提案先行表决。马立克反对这个建议。他说，这是某些国家，包括英国在内，企图避免在联合国大会中表决苏联提案的一种作法。苏联代表坚决主张先表决苏联提案，因为苏联的提案是先提交审查的。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表发言支持苏联代表团的要求。
