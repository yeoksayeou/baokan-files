Thanks to Soviet Geological Experts for Their Help

Fan Kai, Deputy Engineer of the Geological Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

At the end of December 1952, when I had completed the drilling design for the Gongchangling area, several Soviet geological experts came to the Geological Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Before two Soviet experts reviewed my drilling design, I was confident that no questions would be raised. However, during the review, the Soviet experts first asked me, "What is the purpose?" I told them, "To obtain A-grade ore reserves." The Soviet experts listened and told me, "It is impossible to obtain A-grade ore reserves this way." Then the Soviet experts asked me, "Why do you set up a drill hole every three or four hundred meters?" I replied, "To avoid waste." The Soviet experts said, "Do you know that if the technical design is based on the data obtained from such drilling, and a large-scale mine is built, and many factories are designed based on this, but the built factories and mines cannot produce according to the original plan due to the incorrect original data, and the result is scrapped, then in terms of manpower, material resources, time, and the entire national construction, there will be incalculable waste and losses. Have you considered this?" At that time, I was speechless. Then the Soviet experts told me how to design for A-grade ore reserves drilling for layered ore deposits. According to the spirit of the Soviet experts' suggestions, I conducted a second design. The maximum error of the ore reserve numbers proposed by the drilling according to the second design will not exceed 10%; and according to the results obtained from the first design, even I don't know how reliable it is.

When I took the Soviet experts to the mine, the Soviet experts first asked me, "Where were the samples taken?" So I took the Soviet experts to the place where we had taken samples in the past. After the Soviet experts looked at the remains of our sampling, they put forward suggestions for improvement. Because we stipulated that a sample should be taken every two meters, nominally along a line, but in practice, we selected good places to sample within these two meters, and actually gathered a few pieces to make up the quantity; of course, this could not correctly and comprehensively represent the grade of the ore within that two-meter distance. The Soviet experts also told me, "The sampling specification is one sample every two meters, with a width of ten centimeters and a depth of five centimeters. When sampling in the pit, it is necessary to sample on both walls of the tunnel at the same time, and a standard template must be made so that the carved ore groove can be checked with the template at any time." At that time, I thought: the hardness of the Gongchangling magnetite lean ore is between six and seven degrees, and it is impossible to carve so deep with an ordinary carbon steel hand drill; therefore, I said, "It's impossible to carve so deep!" The Soviet experts told me that when he first graduated from school, he had personally taken samples, and he took two samples a day, while other skilled workers could take six samples a day. Later, we took samples according to the Soviet experts' suggestions for a few days, and the facts proved that it could still be taken, only the initial sampling efficiency was low.

In the past, our sampling locations were more than 30 meters away from the section line. After the Soviet experts looked at the sampling location map, they asked me:
"Why take samples so far away from the section line?" I said, "The grade of layered ore deposits is about the same 30 meters away." The Soviet experts said very seriously, "How can a worker engaged in economic construction say such a thing?" As a result, we re-sampled all the unqualified samples.

In the past, when we sampled, we always discarded the interlayers. In many areas, there were very many interlayers. As a result, we gathered a few thin iron layers and took one sample. The analysis results of such samples were sometimes rich ore. The Soviet experts pointed to such areas on the sampling location map and told us: "This area has no mining value, but your analysis results are rich ore; the fact is that your sampling spirit is not right. In areas like this, if mining is really carried out, the interlayers will definitely affect the grade of the ore. Therefore, when sampling, the interlayers should also be taken together with the useful minerals." Finally, the Soviet experts made a regulation for us that when the surrounding rock is greater than two meters, it can be not sampled or sampled separately (whether to sample depends on the need); if the surrounding rock is less than two meters, the surrounding rock must be taken together with the useful minerals.

I took the Soviet experts to see the No. 16 drill hole in Gongchangling. After the Soviet experts finished reading the core record table, they said to me, "You have drilled more than 140 meters, how many times have you measured the bending angle of the drill hole?" I replied, "Not once." The Soviet experts thought that I had not heard his question clearly, so he repeated it again. After I explained that we did not have such measuring instruments and that I had not done such measuring work, the Soviet experts told me the method of measuring the bending angle of the drill hole, and we did it according to this method, which was very effective.

The Gongchangling No. 16 drill hole encountered three layers of iron ore. The core recovery rate of one layer was 66%, the second layer was 40%, and the third layer was 6%. When the Soviet experts discovered this problem, they immediately told me, "This drill hole has become a waste hole, you should notify to stop drilling, and quickly add one." At that time, the Soviet experts told me, "The reasons for the low core recovery rate are, first, the inner diameter of the drill bit is too small. Generally speaking, the inner diameter of the opening drill bit must be above 130 mm, and the inner diameter of the drill bit at the final point must not be less than 89 mm; and the inner diameter of the drill bit you are currently drilling in the middle is only 80 mm, so the core recovery rate will of course be low. Second, the time to lift the drill is too long. In iron ore drilling, the longest time should not exceed two meters, and it is necessary to lift the drill once. In areas with too soft or too broken rock layers, it is necessary to lift the drill every half meter. Third, the operation is not skilled enough. For example, the feed handle should not move up and down during the drilling time, and the drill bit should be lowered at once.... Fourth, there is a problem with the ideological understanding of the operation." When I heard that the Soviet experts said it made sense, especially when the Soviet experts talked about the specific operation methods on the drilling machine, it was very practical and experienced, which made me feel a little strange; so I asked:
"Aren't you engaged in geological surveys? How do you know the specific operation methods on the drilling machine?" The Soviet experts said, "A geological engineer must be completely proficient in all the work in an exploration area; otherwise, you cannot be responsible for the leadership and command of the entire exploration area." Originally, the geological engineers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company did not care about the operation of the drilling machine at all. Hearing what the Soviet experts said, I realized that our past work was too insufficient.

When the Soviet experts went to inspect our core warehouse, they put forward many opinions on our core management. He found that the core sequence of No. 4 hole of Dashiqiao was disordered, and immediately announced that it should be treated as a waste hole, and pointed out seriously that this was a destructive behavior, and suggested that the organization should give strict punishment to the relevant personnel who misplaced the core of No. 4 drill hole. He said, "The core is the most precious and reliable original data for our geological survey work and even economic construction. No one has any reason not to pay attention to this work." At the same time, he put forward many improvement suggestions on core management and core storage.

We did not use any exploration methods to measure the dip angle of a local nearly vertical fault, but only roughly looked at it on the surface and filled it in on the map. The Soviet experts pointed to the drawing and asked me:
"How big is the dip angle?" I said, "About 80 to 90 degrees." The Soviet experts asked again, "How big is it exactly?" I couldn't say. The Soviet experts asked again, "Did you actually measure it?" I said, "No." The Soviet experts said, "The first important idea of geological workers is to seek truth from facts."

In the detailed investigation summary work of Gongchangling, the Soviet experts particularly pointed out that the ore reserve calculation map must be correct. At the same time, he showed us what a profile map should look like. In addition to drawing geological boundaries on the profile map, the sampling positions were drawn on the surface and in the tunnel, and the numbers were compiled. On the same drawing, the results of chemical analysis were also listed on the drawing. Through this drawing, not only can the relationship between the rock strata and the ore body be seen clearly, but also the distribution of ore grade can be seen at a glance.

Regarding writing geological reports, the Soviet experts gave us an outline. Before the Soviet experts came to Anshan, we had already written most of it. We wrote in more detail about rocks and structures, but very little about exploration methods, processes, and in some places we didn't write anything at all. However, what the Soviet experts advocated was to write the exploration methods and processes in as much detail as possible, and they did not advocate listing all the phenomena in detail about rocks, structures, etc., but advocated using practicality as the standard, and stopping when appropriate; they advocated brevity and clarity in writing, did not want lengthy discussions, and did not advocate empty talk about theory.

From these specific examples, I have the following understanding of the spirit of the Soviet experts' suggestions: the focus of geological exploration should be on the exploration of the grade and quantity of useful minerals. For general commonality and text reports and charts that can only be used for theoretical reference, they should be done as little as possible or not done (except in special cases). That is, do what is needed, and it must be done to correctly determine the value of economic construction.

With the help of Soviet experts, I have learned many new things, and the biggest gain is that I have a new understanding of exploration ideas. In the past, I explored for the sake of exploration, to expand theoretical insights, to visit a few more mines, and to explore for the sake of fame. Therefore, I always thought that "probably so" and "almost" would be enough, which resulted in many projects carried out by the 531 Geological Survey Team under my leadership being reworked because the quality did not meet the requirements of the technical design. Now I have realized that my old exploration ideas are undesirable, so I have decided to make a thorough criticism and establish a new exploration idea of resolutely learning from the Soviet Union and seeking truth from facts to serve industrial construction.

    感谢苏联地质专家对我的帮助
    鞍山钢铁公司地质处副工程师　樊开
    一九五二年十二月末，我作完了弓长岭地区的钻探设计时，苏联几位地质专家来到了鞍钢地质处。在两位苏联专家审核我的钻探设计之前，我是满怀信心地估计不会提出什么疑问的。但在审核的时候，苏联专家首先问我：“什么目的？”我告诉他们：“求A级矿量。”苏联专家听了，就告诉我说：“这样做是不可能求出A级矿量来的。”接着苏联专家又问我：“为什么你要距离三、四百公尺远才设一个钻孔呢？”我答：“怕浪费。”苏联专家说：“你知不知道，如果根据这样钻探所得出来的资料进行技术设计，以至于建设成一个很大规模的矿山，并由此而一系列地设计出来许多工厂，结果却会因为你这个原始资料不正确，将使这些建成的工厂、矿山不能按原定计划进行生产，结果只好作废，这样无论在人力、物力、时间以至国家的整个建设上都要受到无法计算的浪费和损失，这个账你算过了没有？”当时我是瞠目以对。于是苏联专家又告诉我成层矿床的A级矿量钻探设计应该怎样做。根据苏联专家建议的精神，我又进行了第二次的设计。依照第二次设计进行钻探所提出来的矿量数字，最大误差也不会超过百分之十；而根据第一次设计所得出来的结果，连我自己也不知道究竟能有多大的可靠性。
    当我把苏联专家领到矿山的时候，苏联专家首先问我：“在那里采的样？”于是我把苏联专家领到过去我们曾经采过样的地方，苏联专家看完我们采过的遗痕，提出了改进意见。因为我们规定两公尺采一个样，名义上是采一条线，而作法却是在这两公尺内选择好采的地方采，实际是零零星星地采几块就凑够了数量；这样当然不能正确地全面地代表那两公尺距离内矿石的品位了。苏联专家又告诉我：“采样的规格是两公尺远一个，宽是十公分，深是五公分。在坑内采样时，须在坑道的两壁一齐采，而且一定要做一个标准的样板，以便随时随地用样板来检查所刻的矿槽。”当时我想：弓长岭的磁铁贫矿的硬度是六度到七度之间，用普通炭素钢的手钻是刻不了那么深的；因此我说：“刻那么深，干不了！”苏联专家又告诉我：他刚从学校毕业的时候，曾经亲手采过，他每天采两个，而其他熟练的工人一天能采六个。后来我们按着苏联专家的意见采了几天，事实证明还是能采下来的，就只初采时的效率低。
    过去我们的采样位置，有距离剖面线三十多公尺远的。苏联专家看过了采样位置图，然后问我：
  “为什么要距离剖面线这么远采样？”我说：“成层矿床三十公尺远，品位差不多。”苏联专家很严肃地说：“一个经济建设的工作者，怎样能说出这样的话来呢？”结果我们把不合要求的试样又都重新采了一遍。
    我们过去采样，总是把夹层丢开，有许多地区夹层非常多，结果我们凑了几个薄的铁层才采了一个试样。这类试样的分析结果，有的是富矿。苏联专家在采样位置图上指着这样的地区告诉我们：“这里没有开采价值，而你们的分析结果却是富矿；事实是你们的采样精神不对。像这样地区，如果真的进行开采，夹层一定会影响矿石的品位的。因此，在采样的时候，就应该把夹层也放在有用矿物一起采才对。”最后苏联专家替我们作了一个规定，就是围岩大于两公尺时，可以不采或另采（采与不采看需要决定）；如果围岩小于两公尺时，一定要把围岩放在有用矿物内一起采。
    我领苏联专家去看弓长岭的第十六号钻孔。苏联专家把岩心记录表看完了以后，对我说：“已经钻进一百四十多公尺了，钻孔的弯曲角度测验了几次？”我答：“一次也没有测验。”苏联专家以为我没有听清楚他的问话，因此他又重复了一遍。我把我们没有这样的测验仪器、而我也没有做过这样的测验工作的情况说明以后，苏联专家就告诉我测验钻孔弯曲角度的办法，我们照这个办法去做，非常有效。
    弓长岭第十六号钻孔共遇铁矿三层。有一层的岩心采取率是百分之六十六，第二层是百分之四十，第三层是百分之六。苏联专家发现了这个问题的时候，立即告诉我：“这个钻孔已成废孔，应该通知停钻，并赶快追补一个。”当时苏联专家告诉我：“岩心采取率低的原因，第一是因为钻头内口直径太小了。一般的说，开口钻头内口直径须在一百三十公厘以上，最终点的钻头内口直径不得小于八十九公厘；而你们现在正在钻进中途的钻头，内口直径仅为八十公厘，岩心采取率当然要低。第二是因为提钻时间拖得太长，在铁矿钻探，最长不能超过两公尺就必需提钻一次，在岩层太软或太碎的地区，半公尺就需要提钻一次。第三是因为操作上还不够熟练。譬如给进把在钻进时间内不该上下移动，而且应该一次下钻粒……。第四是操作的思想认识问题。”我一听苏联专家说得很有道理，特别是苏联专家对钻探机上的具体操作方法讲得非常实际、老练，倒使我感觉有些奇怪起来；于是我问：
  “你不是搞地质调查的吗？怎么还懂得钻探机上的具体操作方法呢？”苏联专家说：“一个地质工程师对于一个勘查地区的全部工作必须完全精通；不然你是担负不了整个勘查地区的领导与指挥的责任的。”本来鞍钢的地质工程师是根本不管钻探机的操作工作的，听苏联专家这样一说，我才认识到我们过去的工作做得太不够了。
    当苏联专家去检查我们的岩心仓库时，对我们的岩心管理上提出了许多意见。他发现大石桥的四号孔的岩心顺序排乱了，便立即宣布当作废孔处理，而且严肃地指出，这是一种破坏行为，并建议组织上对于四号钻孔岩心错乱的有关人员给以严格的处分。他说：“岩心是我们地质调查工作上以至于经济建设上的最宝贵、最可靠的原始资料，任何人都没有半点理由不重视这项工作。”同时他提出许多岩心管理上和岩心保管上的改进意见。
    有一个局部的近于直立的横断层倾角，我们并没有用什么勘探手段来进行测量，只在地表上大致看了一下就填在图上了。苏联专家指着图纸问我：
  “倾角多大？”我说：“大概八十度到九十度。”苏联专家又问：“到底多大？”我可说不上来了。苏联专家又问：“你实际测了吗？”我说：“没有。”苏联专家说：“地质工作者第一个重要思想是实事求是。”
    在弓长岭的精查总结工作中，苏联专家特别指出来的是矿量计算图一定要正确。同时他给我们做出一张剖面图的样子。在剖面图上除了画上地质界线外，地表与坑道都画上了采样的位置，而且编上了号数。在同一张图纸上，又把化学分析的结果也列在图上。通过这张图，不独能把岩层与矿体的关系看清，而且矿石的品位分布状况也可以一目了然。
    关于写地质报告书，苏联专家给我们写出来一个提纲。在苏联专家没有到鞍山以前，我们已经写了大部分了，其中对于岩石及构造方面写得比较详细，而对于勘查手段、方法、过程都写得非常少，有的地方干脆没有写。可是苏联专家所主张的都是尽量要把勘查手段、方法过程写得详细，对于岩石、构造等等不主张面面俱到地罗列现象，而主张以实用为标准，适可而止；对文字则主张简要明了，不希望长篇大论，更不主张空谈理论。
    从以上这些具体例子中，我对苏联专家建议的精神有这样的体会：地质勘查的重点应放在有用矿物的品位与矿量的勘查上，对于一般共同性的、仅能做理论上的参考的文字报告、图表等，应尽可能少做或者不做（特殊情况者例外）。也就是需要什么做什么，而且一定要做到能正确地决定经济建设的价值为目的。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，我学会了许多新的东西，而最大的收获还在于我对勘查思想有了新的认识。过去我是为勘查而勘查，为扩充理论见地，多走几个矿山，好有名望而勘查，因此对待工作总是认为
  “大概如此”、“差不多”就行了，以致造成我所领导的五三一地质调查队所进行的许多工程，都因为质量不合于技术设计的要求而返工。现在我已经认识到我的旧勘查思想是要不得的，所以决定来一次彻底的批判，树立起坚决向苏联学习、实事求是地为工业建设服务的新的勘查思想。
