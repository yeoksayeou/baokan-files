    Jilin Railway Administration Should Find Ways to Avoid Incidents of Trains Stopping Outside Signals
    A letter from Wang Gui of the Jilin Railway Administration's Motive Power Department: From January to the end of September this year, the Jilin Railway Administration had a total of 8,568 incidents of trains stopping outside signals, with a total stopping time of 27,425 minutes, causing a loss of 1,068.8 million yuan to the state (each minute a train stops outside a signal costs the state approximately 38,900 yuan).
    The main reasons for trains stopping outside signals are: carelessness on the part of station personnel handling signals – such as the station master on duty. For example, on September 28th, the Tongfosi Station master originally planned to let train No. 460 enter the station first, but due to poor management, he let train No. 4701 enter first, causing train No. 460 to stop outside the signal for five minutes. On September 24th, Sun Dianchang, the station master on duty at the Haofu Station, discovered that the "track warrant" was still on his person after issuing the train departure signal. After the train had already started, he hurriedly issued a stop signal, and the train conductor had to pull the "conductor's valve" to stop the train. Improper placement of signals and a display distance that does not meet the standard of 800 meters also easily cause stopping incidents. As of the end of September, there were still 35 signal lights within the Jilin Bureau's jurisdiction whose display distance did not meet the standard. The up and down entry signals at Qidaohezi Station are not visible from a distance of 500 meters, making it difficult for drivers to see.
    Trains frequently stopping outside signals not only prolongs the running time of vehicles, but also causes wear and tear on parts and wastes coal, which is obviously not in line with the requirements of increasing production and practicing thrift. It is recommended that the Jilin Railway Administration take prompt measures to correct this avoidable waste.

### 吉林铁路管理局应设法避免列车在信号机外方停车事件

    吉林铁路管理局应设法避免列车在信号机外方停车事件
    吉林铁路管理局机务处王贵来信：吉林铁路管理局从今年一月到九月末共发生列车在信号机外方停车事件八千五百六十八次，停留时间达二万七千四百二十五分钟，使国家遭到十亿六千八百多万元的损失（列车在信号机外方停车一分钟，约使国家损失三万八千九百多元）。
    造成列车在信号机外方停车的主要原因是：车站办理信号的人员——值班站长等的马虎大意。如九月二十八日，铜佛寺站长原计划让四百六十次列车先进站，但由于管理不善，先放进了四千七百零一次列车，致使四百六十次列车在信号机外方停了五分钟。九月二十四日，哈福车站值班站长孙殿昌在发出列车出发信号后，发现“路牌”还背在身上，在列车已经开动后又急忙发出停车信号，列车车长不得不拉“车长阀”停车。信号机安置位置不当和显示距离达不到八百公尺的标准，也容易造成停车事件。直到九月底，吉林局管内还有三十五件信号机显示距离达不到标准。七道河子站的上下行进站信号机，在距离五百公尺远的地方还看不见，使司机了望时感到困难。
    列车经常在信号机外方停车不但会延长车辆的运行时间，而且会造成机件磨耗和费煤等损失，显然不合增产节约的要求。建议吉林铁路管理局迅速采取措施，纠正这种可以避免的浪费现象。
