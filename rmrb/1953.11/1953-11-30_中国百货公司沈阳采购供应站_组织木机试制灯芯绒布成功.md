China Department Store Shenyang Purchasing and Supply Station
Successfully Organizes Trial Production of Corduroy Fabric with Wooden Looms

The corduroy fabric worn in the Northeast region has always relied on supplies from within the customs (关内, i.e., other parts of China) or imports. Over the past year, due to the sharp increase in the national consumption of corduroy fabric and limited production equipment, state-owned stores in various parts of the Northeast have not been able to fully meet consumer needs. On the other hand, the human-powered wooden looms in various parts of the Northeast are facing elimination due to outdated equipment, inferior products, and high costs. In the face of the need to properly arrange this part of the productive forces and the shortage of corduroy fabric, the Shenyang Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station sent people to the private Hongchuan and Suijia wooden loom weaving factories to conduct trial production of corduroy fabric. After joint research with the workers of the two factories, some parts of the original wooden looms were modified. After repeated trial weaving, the first piece of corduroy fabric was produced at the end of October.

The trial products produced by human-powered wooden looms are of similar quality to Shanghai goods. According to preliminary calculations, their cost is lower than that of goods from within the customs. It is estimated that after further improving production, each foot can be cheaper by more than a thousand yuan. In early November, the Shenyang Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station conducted research and promotion at the district-wide processing conference. It was decided to first carry out partial modification of human-powered wooden looms in large cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian. After gaining experience, partial modification of electric wooden looms will be carried out. It is planned to start large-scale processing and production next year to supplement the source of corduroy fabric and solve the problem of arranging handicraft textile production capacity.

    中国百货公司沈阳采购供应站
    组织木机试制灯芯绒布成功
    中国百货公司沈阳采购供应站组织沈阳纺织业中的木机机台，试制灯芯绒布成功。
    东北区内穿用的灯芯绒布一向是依靠关内或是进口供应的。一年来，由于灯芯绒布在全国的消费量大增，而生产设备有限，所以东北各地国营商店也不能充分的供应消费者需要。另一方面，东北各地的人力纺织木机却因为设备落后，产品较次成本又高而将淘汰。在这一部分生产力需要妥善安排和灯芯绒布不足的情况下，沈阳百货采购供应站就派人在私营鸿川、隋家两个木机织布厂进行灯芯绒布试制工作。经和两厂工人共同研究，将原有木机改装了一部分零件，多次试织结果，已在十月末生产出来第一匹灯芯绒布。
    人力木机生产的试制品和上海货质量近似，据初步计算其成本低于关内，估计进一步提高生产后每尺能便宜千元以上。十一月初，沈阳百货采购供应站已在全区加工会议上进行研究推广。确定在沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大等大城市先进行部分人力木机改装，在取得经验后，再对部分电力木机进行改装，准备从明年开始，进行大规模加工生产，以补充灯芯绒布的货源，解决手工纺织生产能力的安排问题。　（李继尧）
