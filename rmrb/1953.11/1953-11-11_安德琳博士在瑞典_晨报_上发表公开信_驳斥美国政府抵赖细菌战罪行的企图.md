Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, November 9th: The Swedish "Morning News" published a letter from Dr. Andre Andreen, which stated: "The International Scientific Commission came to the conclusion that the American armed forces were using bacteriological weapons even before meeting the captured American pilots. We based our conclusions on the facts we studied in Northeast China, primarily the anthrax epidemic, before we even went to Korea. The confessions of the American pilots merely confirmed our conclusions. I mentioned this today in a statement to the press from Professor Ma Del and Dr. Joseph Needham. Dr. Needham's statement read: 'I have said more than once in the past few years that we regard the confessions of the American pilots merely as corroborating evidence, and that the basis of our belief is the large amount of objective material provided by Chinese scientists, many of whom I knew very well during the Second World War.' The twenty-five pilots who had provided written proof of their participation in bacteriological warfare were released on September 6. If their confessions were untrue and made under duress, why did they—all twenty-five pilots—not immediately say so upon returning home? Because they would certainly have received a lighter penalty for doing so. Only a small number of them have changed their position. It is conceivable that they encountered serious situations after returning home. If the question of facts is raised, then here there is truth, there is a truth. It may take a long time for all the facts to be known and recognized by everyone. There have been many similar examples in science. But this time, the truth will eventually come to light. As for myself, I am calmly awaiting that day. Prohibiting the use of weapons of mass slaughter, and all countries abiding by this prohibition, is extremely important for the entire world of the future. Therefore, I welcome with pleasure the resolution unanimously adopted at the Sixth International Congress of Microbiologists held in Rome in September 1953. The Congress reflected the opinion of all microbiologists, declaring that microbiology should forever serve the happiness of mankind; that all discoveries in microbiology should be used for this purpose; and that all countries should participate in the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons in war."

　　安德琳博士在瑞典“晨报”上发表公开信
    驳斥美国政府抵赖细菌战罪行的企图
   【新华社十日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩九日讯：瑞典“晨报”刊载了安德烈·安德琳博士的一封信，信中说：“国际科学委员会在会见被俘的美国飞行员以前就得出了结论：美国的武装部队使用着细菌武器。我们根据我们在中国东北所研究过的事实、首先是炭疽热流行的事实，在我们还没有到朝鲜去以前，就得出了我们的结论。美国飞行员的供词，只不过证实了我们的结论罢了。我今天从马戴尔教授和李约瑟博士那里得到的、向新闻界发表的声明中就提到这一点。李约瑟博士的声明中写道：‘在过去几年中我不止一次地说过，我们把美国飞行员的供词仅仅当成一种证明材料罢了，而我们的信念的基础，是大批中国科学家提供的那些客观材料，这些中国科学家中有许多都是我在第二次世界大战的时候就知道得很清楚的。’曾经用书面证明自己参加细菌战的二十五名飞行员，已于九月六日被释放了。如果他们的供词是不真实的和出于被迫的，那末，为什么他们——所有二十五个飞行员不在回到自己那里以后立刻说出这一点呢？因为这样他们就一定会受到更轻的刑罚的。他们之中只有一小部分人改变了他们的立场。可以设想，在他们回家以后，他们遇到了严重的情势。如果提出事实的问题，那么在这里就有着真理，有着一个真理。要全部事实都为大家所知道和为大家所承认，可能还要一段很长的时间。科学上有过许多类似的例子。可是这一次也总有一天会真相大白的。就我自己来说，我很平静地等待着这一天的到来。禁止使用大规模屠杀的武器，所有国家都遵守这一禁令，对于未来的整个世界是极其重要的。因此，我以愉快的心情欢迎一九五三年九月在罗马召开的第六届国际微生物学家代表大会上一致通过的决议。代表大会反映了所有微生物学家的意见，它宣布，微生物学应该永远为人类的幸福服务；微生物学上的所有发现应当用之于这个目的；一切国家应当参加规定在战争中禁用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。”
