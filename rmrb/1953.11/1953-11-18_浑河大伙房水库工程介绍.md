    In Dahuo房 Village, a suburb of Fushun City, China's famous coal capital, a grand struggle of mankind to conquer nature has begun. Labor heroes from all directions who have come here feel honored and proud to participate in the construction of China's second giant reservoir—the Hun River Dahuo房 Reservoir.

    The Hun River is a major tributary among the fifty-odd tributaries of the Liao River. It originates from the Gunma Ridge at an elevation of 750 meters above sea level in Xinbin County, Liaoning Province, and flows westward to the San岔口 in Haicheng County where it merges with the Taizi River into the Liao River, with a total length of 364 kilometers. The upper reaches of the Hun River have mountains accounting for 75 percent of the entire basin area, with sparse trees, and the riverbed is narrow and steep. During the rainy season, the river water swells to dozens of times its normal flow. This rapid and turbulent flood not only seriously threatens the safety of the industrial cities of Shenyang and Fushun and the lives and property of the people on both sides of the Hun River but also greatly aggravates the floods in the lower reaches of the Liao River. More than twenty years ago, the Hun River floods inundated the urban area of Shenyang five times. When the Liao River flooded from 1935 to 1937, the Hun River floods submerged more than 10 million mu of land. And when factories, mines, and farmland along the coast need water, the Hun River dries up, revealing large areas of white sand. Therefore, the People's Government decided to comprehensively control the Hun River starting this year, beginning with the construction of the Dahuo房 Reservoir.

    The Hun River Dahuo房 Reservoir is being built in Dahuo房 Village on the outskirts of Fushun City. This is a village on the right bank of the middle reaches of the Hun River, close to the Shen(yang)-Ji(lin) Railway. In front of the village, two mountains face each other across the river, with a gorge more than 1,000 meters wide in the middle. Above the gorge is a wide valley surrounded by mountains. The Dahuo房 Reservoir project is to build a 41-meter high and 1,367-meter long earth dam here to close the gorge in front of Dahuo房 Village, blocking the path of the flood and forcing it to obediently stay in the valley. In addition, a 6.5-meter diameter and 556-meter long water diversion tunnel will be dug into the mountain at the left end of the earth dam to supply water for industry, irrigation, power generation, and navigation throughout the year. The third project is to build an 850-meter long and 100-meter wide spillway on the mountain at the right end of the earth dam. This spillway has a certain height, and when the flood exceeds the maximum capacity of the reservoir, the excess water will automatically flow into the riverbed along the spillway to ensure the safety of the earth dam. These projects are all large in scale. The earth dam alone will require 7.78 million cubic meters of earth. In order to save manpower and strive to overcome the flood in time, the Dahuo房 Reservoir project is divided into two phases according to the suggestion of Soviet reservoir expert Shabayev. The first phase is to store water for flood control and irrigation, including the construction of three major projects: the water diversion tunnel, the earth dam, and the spillway, which are expected to be completed before the flood season in 1956. The second phase will construct a hydroelectric power station and develop irrigation and navigation.

    Now, the water diversion tunnel of this large mountain valley reservoir has officially started construction in early November. The mechanical stone-breaking engineering team is operating rock drills, advancing into the rock at the base of the mountain on the left end of the dam site. The sound of blasting rocks announced the beginning of the conquest of the Hun River. By 1956, when this large mountain valley reservoir begins to store floodwaters, the vast valley with an area of more than 1.5 million mu will have a maximum storage capacity of 1.859 billion cubic meters. The two major industrial cities of Shenyang and Fushun and the millions of people on both sides of the Hun River will be relieved of the threat of floods. The floods in the lower reaches of the Liao River will also be greatly reduced due to the reservoir storing a large amount of floodwater from the Hun River. The reservoir will also continuously supply the water needed by the industries, residents, canals, and parks of Shenyang and Fushun, and can irrigate large tracts of farmland on both sides of the Hun River, guaranteeing increased grain production and making the lives of thousands of farmers more prosperous.

    浑河大伙房水库工程介绍
    新华社记者　张龙题
    在我国著名的煤都抚顺市郊的大伙房村，一场人类征服自然的宏伟斗争已经开始了。从四面八方来到这里的劳动能手们，都为自己参加建筑我国第二个巨型水库——浑河大伙房水库感到光荣和骄傲。
    浑河是辽河五十多条支流中一条较大的支流，发源于辽东省新宾县拔海七百五十公尺的滚马岭，西下到海城县的三岔口和太子河汇流入辽河，全长达三百六十四公里。浑河上游有占整个流域面积百分之七十五的山地，树木稀少，河床狭而陡。每逢雨季，河水暴涨超过平常流量几十倍。这股急湍直泻的洪水，不仅严重地威胁着沈阳、抚顺等工业城市和浑河两岸人民生命财产的安全，并大大加重了辽河下游的水灾。二十多年前，浑河洪水曾经五次浸入沈阳市区。一九三五年到一九三七年辽河泛滥时，浑河洪水淹地一千多万亩。而当沿岸的工厂、矿山和农田需要用水时，浑河又干枯得显出大片白沙。因此，人民政府决定从今年开始根治浑河，首先着手修建大伙房水库。
    浑河大伙房水库修建在抚顺市郊大伙房村，这是浑河中游右岸一个紧靠着沈（阳）吉（林）铁路的村庄。村前两山隔河对峙，中间是一个有一千多公尺宽的山峡，山峡上面有一个群山环抱着的宽阔山谷，大伙房水库工程就是要在这里修建一座四十一公尺高，一千三百六十七公尺长的拦河大土坝，把大伙房村前的山峡封闭起来，拦住洪水的去路，使它驯服地在山谷里就范，另外，在土坝左端的山根凿开直径六点五公尺、长达五百五十六公尺的输水隧洞，以终年供应工业、灌溉、发电、航运所需的用水。第三个工程是在土坝右端的山上修建一个八百五十公尺长、一百公尺宽的溢洪道，这个溢洪道有一定的高度，当洪水超过水库的最大容量时，多余的水就会自动地沿着溢洪道流到河床里，以保证拦河大土坝的安全，这些工程的规模都很大，单是拦河大土坝就要用土七百七十八万立方公尺。为了节省人力、争取战胜洪水的时间，大伙房水库工程根据苏联水库专家沙巴耶夫的建议，分为两期施工。第一期蓄水防洪兼顾灌溉，包括修建输水隧洞、拦河大土坝和溢洪道等三大工程，预计在一九五六年汛期前竣工；第二期再建设水力发电站和举办灌溉、航运等事业。
    现在，这座大型山谷水库的输水隧洞已经在十一月初旬正式开工了。机械开石工程队正操纵着凿岩机，向坝址左端山根的岩石掘进。开山的炮声宣告了征服浑河的开端，到一九五六年，当这座大型山谷水库开始拦蓄洪水时，面积达一百五十多万亩的宽阔山谷，最大蓄水量将有十八亿五千九百万立方公尺，沈阳、抚顺两大工业城市和浑河两岸的千百万人民，就将从此减轻洪水的威胁。辽河下游的水灾，也将由于这座水库拦蓄了浑河的大量洪水而大大减轻。水库并将源源不断地供给沈阳、抚顺两市的工业、居民、运河、公园等所需要的用水，并可以灌溉浑河两岸大片田地，保证增产大批粮食，使成千上万农民的生活更加富裕起来。
