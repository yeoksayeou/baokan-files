Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 10th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in view of the approaching anniversary of the Vietnamese people's National Resistance Day against the French colonialists for freedom and independence (December 19), issued an appeal to the workers of the world. The appeal states:

The representatives of 88,600,000 workers from 79 countries have solemnly declared at the Third World Trade Union Congress convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions that December 19, 1953—the Vietnamese People's Resistance Day—will be the International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Day of Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam.

The WFTU's appeal points out that the French imperialists, regardless of heavy casualties, violating the right of self-determination of all peoples, and undermining the principles of the United Nations Charter, are trying to preserve their privileges in Vietnam at all costs, suppressing Vietnam's right to national independence, to a free life, and to manage the country's natural resources according to its own will, and the legitimate desire to improve the living standards of its people.

The war in Vietnam continues because the U.S. government, on the one hand, wants to maintain the profits of American monopoly capital—which owns 89 percent of Indochina's rubber and 52 percent of its tin—and on the other hand, after the world's people forced them to end the bloody war in Korea, still wants to collude with international imperialism to preserve Vietnam as a hotbed of war in Asia and a military base for aggression against the free and peace-loving People's Republic of China.

The appeal continues that the French working class and democratic forces resolutely oppose the continuation of this "dirty war" against the Vietnamese people. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the courageous attitude of the French working people have led French public opinion to openly demand an end to hostilities in Vietnam, a negotiated end to the war, and the establishment of peace.

At the Third World Trade Union Congress, the representatives of the working people of the world, united with their Vietnamese brothers, demanded an immediate end to the war in Vietnam and adopted a resolution on the International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People.

In order to achieve this lofty goal, which is of vital importance for the defense of peace, the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on national trade union centers, international organizations, all trade unions, and all working people, regardless of political beliefs and trade union affiliations, to take the necessary measures in their respective countries to make December 19, 1953, a great day of united struggle to stop the colonial war in Vietnam, to fight for the withdrawal of expeditionary forces, and to fight for the recognition of Vietnam's legitimate right to freedom and independence.

All concrete measures should be encouraged and given full attention. In the preparatory stage, the World Federation of Trade Unions suggests organizing exhibitions, rallies, and conferences to expose the crimes of the French colonialists and to demand a cessation of hostilities.

The appeal concludes by saying that the Third World Trade Union Congress has shown that the cause for which the Vietnamese people are struggling is the common cause of all workers and people throughout the world.

    世界工联书记处发表告世界工人书
    号召各国工人参加国际支援越南人民日
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社维也纳十日讯：世界工会联合会书记处鉴于越南人民反对法国殖民者、争取自由与独立的全国抗战日（十二月十九日）即将来到，特发表告世界工人书，文告说：
    七十九个国家八千八百六十万工人的代表已经在世界工联召集的世界工会第三次代表大会上庄严地宣布，一九五三年十二月十九日——越南人民抗战日——将是国际积极支援越南人民日和争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日。
    世界工联的文告指出，法国帝国主义者不顾重大伤亡，违反了各国人民的自决权，破坏了联合国宪章的原则，正想不惜用一切代价来保留它在越南的特权，扼杀越南要求民族独立、要求自由生活并按照自己的意志来处理这个国家的天然财富的权利、要求提高它的人民的生活水平的理所当然的愿望。
    美国政府一方面想保持美国垄断资本的利润——它们拥有印度支那橡胶的百分之八十九、锡的百分之五十二，另一方面，在世界人民迫使它们结束了朝鲜流血战争以后，它们仍想与国际帝国主义狼狈为奸来保留越南作为亚洲的战争温床，以及对自由的、爱好和平的中华人民共和国进行侵略行动的军事基地，因此越南的战争仍在进行。
    文告继续说，法国的工人阶级与民主力量坚决反对继续对越南人民进行这个“肮脏的战争”。越南人民的英勇斗争以及法国劳动人民的勇敢的态度，已使法国舆论公开要求停止对越南的敌对行动、通过谈判结束战争并建立和平。
    在世界工会第三次代表大会上，和他们的越南弟兄团结在一起的世界劳动人民的代表，要求立刻结束越南战争，并通过一个关于国际积极支援越南人民日的决议。
    世界工联为实现这一对保卫和平至关紧要的崇高目标，特号召各国工会中央、国际性的组织、所有工会与所有劳动人民，不分政治信仰与工会关系，在各国采取必要措施来使一九五三年十二月十九日成为一个为制止越南殖民战争、争取撤退远征军、争取承认越南得到自由与独立的合法权利而团结斗争的伟大日子。
    所有具体的措施都应该得到鼓舞与充分的注意。在准备阶段，世界工联建议组织展览会、集会与会议来揭发法国殖民者的罪行并要求停止敌对行动。
    文告结语说，世界工会第三次代表大会表明，越南人民所斗争以赴的事业正是所有工人和全世界人民的共同事业。
