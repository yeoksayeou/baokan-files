Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th—The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) are continuing to launch a conservation movement. They are making every effort to save grain and various materials. Many units and individuals have also signed patriotic conservation covenants.

　　The CPV units have universally launched a movement to save one tael of grain per person per day. One unit plans to save more than 246,000 catties of grain from October to the end of December. In order to save firewood expenses and heating costs, cadres and soldiers of many units and organizations have gone to the mountains to collect firewood and grass. The staff of a certain command organization collected 1,500 catties of firewood per person as winter fuel. A certain unit carefully calculated the use of various expenses and plans to save more than 1.1 billion yuan in various expenses from October to the end of December.

　　The CPV units have also universally launched a campaign to collect waste products, collecting a large number of artillery shells and bullet casings. One unit set up a "Patriotic Conservation Waste Collection Room." Soldiers went out to cut grass or work during the day, and at night they carried the collected scrap iron into the room. A certain unit, using the gaps between work and study, picked up more than 11,000 catties of artillery shells in a few days. The "Yang Lian Di Company" also collected more than 32,000 catties of discarded steel rails. Yang Qingyi, deputy company commander of the fifth company of a certain unit, also paid attention to collecting while walking, and picked up more than 500 catties of scrap copper and iron in a short period of time. The soldiers said: If one person picks up one catty, and the collection of thousands of people is put together, it can save the country many tons of copper and iron. Many units also sent the collected scrap copper and iron to their own iron factories to manufacture various tools.

　　The conservation movement in the logistics supply department is also continuing. All stations and warehouses have carefully cleaned up materials and improved the methods of material management. During work breaks, a certain station poured out more than 1,500 kilograms of residual engine oil and 80 kilograms of gasoline from empty oil drums bit by bit. A certain motor vehicle company used work gaps to repair old tires and transform old equipment, saving 195 million yuan in more than two months. They also assembled a new truck with old equipment from the positions.

　　In addition, examples of transportation units improving transportation efficiency and saving gasoline are constantly emerging. The experience of Lu Yaowen, a special-class hero and truck driver, who averaged 16.9 kilometers per gallon of gasoline, has begun to be promoted in some motor vehicle companies (the stipulated amount is 9.58 kilometers per gallon of gasoline). After learning from Lu Yaowen's experience in saving gasoline, the first company of a certain motor vehicle unit can travel 12.76 kilometers per gallon of gasoline, saving more than 100 million yuan in one month. Some vehicles in a certain motor vehicle unit can now travel 15 to 16 kilometers per gallon of gasoline.

    志愿军努力节省粮食和各种资材
   【新华社平壤十六日电】中国人民志愿军各部队继续展开节约运动。他们竭力节省粮食和各种资材。许多单位与个人并已订立了爱国节约公约。
    志愿军各部队普遍展开了每人每天节约一两粮食运动。某部计划从十月到十二月底节约粮食二十四万六千多斤。为了节约柴代金和烤火费，许多部队和机关的干部和战士都上山打柴割草。某指挥机关的工作人员，每人打柴一千五百斤，作为冬季燃料。某部精打细算地使用各种经费，计划从十月到十二月底节约各种费用十一亿多元。
    志愿军各部队还普遍展开了搜集废品运动，搜集了大量炮弹壳和子弹壳。某部布置了一个“爱国节约搜集废品室”。战士们白天出去割草或工作，晚上就挑着搜集到的废铁放进室内。某部利用工作和学习空隙，在几天内就拾了一万一千多斤炮弹壳。“杨连第连”也搜集了废弃钢轨三万二千多斤。某部第五连副连长杨清义，走路时也留心搜集，在很短的时间内就拾了五百多斤废铜废铁。战士们说：一个人拾一斤，把千万个人拾到的汇集在一起，就能为国家节省许多吨铜和铁了。许多部队还把拾到的废铜、废铁送到自己建立的铁工厂里，制造各种工具。
    后勤供应部门的节约运动也在继续展开。各兵站、仓库都认真清理了物资，改进了物资的保管方法。某兵站在工作空隙中，从空油桶中一点一滴地倒出剩余机油一千五百多公斤，汽油八十公斤。某汽车连利用工作空隙修补旧轮胎，改造旧器材，在两个多月内就节约了一亿九千五百万元。他们还用阵地上的旧器材装配了一辆新的大卡车。
    此外，各运输部队提高运输效率和节约汽油的事例也不断涌现。特等功臣、汽车司机卢耀文每加仑汽油平均行驶十六点九公里的经验，已经在某些汽车连队中开始推广（按规定每加仑汽油行驶九点五八公里）。某部汽车一连学习卢耀文节约汽油的经验后，每加仑汽油可以行驶十二点七六公里，在一个月中就节省了一亿多元。某汽车部队有些车辆现在每加仑汽油已经可以行驶十五到十六公里。
