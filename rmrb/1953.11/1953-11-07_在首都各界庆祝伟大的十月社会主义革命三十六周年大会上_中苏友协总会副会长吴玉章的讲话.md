Today we gather here to celebrate the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This year we celebrate the October Revolution Day, just as the Soviet people are victoriously marching towards communism; and just as our people are beginning to implement the first five-year plan, steadily advancing along the road of socialist industrialization. This year we celebrate the October Revolution Day, also just as the long-standing and great friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples are continuously developing, consolidating, and achieving greater success. The Sino-Soviet friendship is increasingly powerfully demonstrating its enormous influence on the prosperity of the two great nations and the just cause of peace for mankind.

The Chinese people greeted the results of the Sino-Soviet talks on Soviet assistance to China's construction this summer with boundless joy and gratitude. In these talks, the Soviet government agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the reconstruction and new construction of 141 large-scale projects in our country by 1959. These projects include iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil refineries, machine manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, power stations, and so on. In these large-scale projects, the Soviet Union provides assistance from start to finish, from selecting sites, conducting designs, supplying equipment, guiding installation, to manufacturing new products. The Soviet Union not only helps us build, but also helps us train technical personnel to master these enterprises. Comrades can imagine what China will be like in 1959: at that time, we will be able to produce all kinds of the latest machinery ourselves to build and transform our industry; we will be able to produce tractors and other modern agricultural machinery ourselves to transform our agriculture; our national defense will be more consolidated; and the lives of our people will be further improved. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his telegram to Chairman Malenkov: "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of ninety-one new enterprises and the fifty enterprises currently under construction and reconstruction in China, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements. This is of utmost importance to China's industrialization, the gradual transition of China to socialism, and the strengthening of the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has become increasingly close. This cooperation has played an important role in the rapid recovery of our economy and in embarking on the road of planned construction.

Everyone remembers that when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed, China and the Soviet Union also signed an agreement on a long-term low-interest loan from the Soviet Union to our country; this loan was used to pay for the machinery and equipment we obtained from the Soviet Union. Trade between China and the Soviet Union has also expanded in recent years. In 1952, China's exports to the Soviet Union accounted for 54 percent of total exports, and imports from the Soviet Union accounted for 53 percent of total imports. This year, trade between China and the Soviet Union has further expanded. Through loans and equal and mutually beneficial trade, we have obtained from the Soviet Union the most urgently needed and latest industrial equipment and other machinery.

Several Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies established in 1950—the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, and the Sino-Soviet Non-ferrous and Rare Metals Company—are all operating smoothly.

The China Changchun Railway, formerly jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, has been handed over to our country in accordance with the agreement. The operation and management of this railway has always been a model for our railways to learn from.

Soviet experts who came to China at the invitation of our government to help with construction have played an outstanding role in various aspects of China's construction. Many large-scale construction projects in our country, such as the Huai River control project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the Fuxin Coal Mine, and the recently completed seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, and the Xi'an No. 2 Thermal Power Plant, were all completed with the help and guidance of Soviet experts, and many huge projects under construction are also proceeding with the help and guidance of Soviet experts. Soviet experts working in China's economic, cultural, and other departments have made outstanding contributions. The work of Soviet experts has been loved by the broad masses of Chinese working people. They have not only helped us solve many difficult problems, but also trained a large number of excellent cadres for us. Thanks to the teaching of Soviet experts and through other channels, advanced Soviet experience is widely disseminated in our country, bringing incalculable benefits to our economic endeavors.

In the past four years, cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union have also become increasingly frequent. Advanced Soviet culture has helped the advancement of China's cultural undertakings.

The classic works of Lenin and Stalin have been widely disseminated in our country in recent years. The number of copies of Lenin's works printed from October 1949 to the end of 1952 reached more than 2,135,000. From 1949 to June 1953, the number of copies of Stalin's works printed reached more than 6.7 million. And the start of the publication of "The Complete Works of Stalin" is a major event in our publishing industry.

Soviet literature and art with high educational significance are loved by the masses of our people, especially the youth. Various Soviet films also have a wide audience among the masses of our people. From 1949 to June of this year, the total number of viewers reached more than 500 million.

In order to train construction talents in various fields, we have sent a large number of students to study in the Soviet Union, and there are currently more than 1,000 people, and more will be sent in the future. Under the kind care of the Soviet Union in various aspects, the enthusiastic teaching of Soviet teachers, and the help of Soviet classmates, coupled with their own efforts, Chinese students generally overcome various difficulties and achieve excellent academic results.

Many cultural groups and cultural institutions in various parts of our country have established ties with Soviet institutions of the same nature. After the return of the delegation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the Soviet Union this year, our scientific community has further realized the advanced nature of Soviet science and the direction of Soviet scientific research work combining the needs of national construction, and has begun to earnestly improve its work. Our medical community is widely studying Pavlov's theory and promoting advanced Soviet medical methods and medical theories. Soviet experience is also an important guide for the reform of our school education. The Chinese People's University has achieved particularly great achievements in learning from Soviet educational experience.

The achievements of the Soviet Union in all aspects of socialist and communist construction are a huge encouragement to the masses of our people. The great Soviet Union is a brilliant example for our construction. In the past four years, with the increase of Sino-Soviet friendship and the development of our national construction, the movement of our people to learn from the Soviet Union has been surging. Now, the task before us is: to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country in a considerable period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. This is the general line and general task of our national construction in the transition period. In the face of this arduous task, the importance of learning from the Soviet Union is even more prominent. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call:
“Launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country.” The experience of recent years has undoubtedly proved that learning from the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet Union’s experience in socialist construction, and learning from the Soviet Union’s advanced science and technology are of urgent and great significance to our various tasks. This is because, in a fundamental sense, the road that the Soviet Union has taken since the October Revolution is the road we are now going to take. Learning from the Soviet Union is learning the ability to correctly build our great motherland, and learning the ability to realize the general line and general tasks of national construction. In order to learn well, we must overcome conservative ideas and complacency, and with high revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific and realistic spirit, combine with the tasks of national construction, sincerely and diligently learn. In addition, we must also learn from the spirit of hard struggle of the Soviet people during the period of socialist construction, subordinating individual, immediate, and partial interests to the fundamental, long-term, and overall interests of national construction, in order to complete our new and great historical task.

The great friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is not only a reliable guarantee for accelerating our country's construction, but also the most powerful force for defending peace in the Far East and the world. The facts of the past few years have fully proved Chairman Mao Zedong's words: "The strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force, a strong guarantee against imperialist aggression and for maintaining peace and security in the Far East, and also a guarantee for the victory of the great cause of striving for world peace." The failure of the war of aggression against Korea launched by US imperialism is the most convincing example. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples with the support of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, and thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Korean armistice was finally realized against the will of US imperialism. The shameful end of the imperialists' adventure in the Far East shows that due to the strong existence of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, and due to the unity of the peoples of Asian countries, the era in which imperialists ran rampant in the East has come to an end forever. There is no doubt that the strong unity between China and the Soviet Union will achieve greater success in the struggle for lasting world peace and the easing of the international situation. As Comrades Malenkov and Molotov said: "The great alliance and fraternal friendship between the Soviet people and the people of the People's Republic of China will continue to be a reliable foundation for ensuring peace and security in the Far East and consolidating world peace."

With the high tide of the movement of our people to learn from the Soviet Union, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also made great progress in recent years. Now, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members, thus giving the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association a broader mass base.

Comrades, all the facts show the brilliant achievements of the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship. Sino-Soviet friendship has not only penetrated the hearts of more than 700 million people in China and the Soviet Union, but has also been warmly supported by progressive people all over the world, and is regarded as a cause related to their own vital interests. The power generated by our friendship is endless and truly invincible. Any conspiracies and tricks of the imperialist war-mongers will continue to be crushed in the face of our strong friendly alliance, this is undoubtedly certain.

Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!
Long live the Soviet leaders headed by Comrade Malenkov!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    在首都各界庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年大会上
    中苏友协总会副会长吴玉章的讲话
    今天我们在这里集会庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年。今年我们庆祝十月革命节，正当着苏联人民胜利地向共产主义迈进的时候；也正当着我国人民开始执行第一个五年计划，沿着社会主义工业化的道路稳步前进的时候。今年我们庆祝十月革命节，也正当着中苏两国人民的历史悠久的伟大友谊和团结不断发展、巩固并取得更大成就的时候，中苏友谊日益有力地显示出对于中苏两大国的繁荣和人类的和平正义事业的巨大的影响。
    中国人民以无限欢欣和感激的心情迎接了今年夏天中苏之间关于苏联援助中国建设的商谈的结果。在这次商谈中，苏联政府答应到一九五九年的时期内在我国改建与新建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助。这些工程中包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、炼油厂、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站等等。而在这些规模巨大的工程中，苏联是从选择厂址、进行设计、供应设备、指导安装一直到制造新产品，从头到尾给予援助的。苏联不仅帮助我们建设，而且帮助我们培养技术人员，来掌握这些企业。同志们可以想像，到了一九五九年那个时候的中国将成为怎样的情形：那时候我们将能自己生产各种各样最新式的机器，来建立和改造我们的工业；我们将能自己生产拖拉机等现代化的农业机械，来改造我们的农业；我国的国防将更为巩固；我国人民的生活将能得到更进一步的改善。正如毛泽东主席致马林科夫主席电中所说的：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    在中华人民共和国成立后四年多来，中苏两国的经济合作是日趋密切的。这种合作对我国经济的迅速恢复和走上有计划建设的道路起了重要的作用。
    大家记得，在签订中苏友好同盟互助条约时，中苏曾签订了苏联给予我国长期低利贷款的协定；这批贷款是用以偿付我国从苏联取得的机器装备和器材的。中苏两国的贸易几年来也日益扩大。一九五二年我国对苏联的出口占出口总额的百分之五十四，由苏联的进口占进口总额的百分之五十三。今年我国与苏联之间的贸易又进一步扩大了。通过贷款和平等互利的贸易，我们从苏联获得了我们最急需的和最新式的工业装备和其他机器。
    一九五○年成立的几个中苏合股公司——中苏民用航空公司、中苏石油公司和中苏有色金属及稀有金属公司——都在顺利地开展着业务。
    原由中苏共管的中国长春铁路已按协定交给了我国。这条铁路的经营管理一直是我国各铁路学习的榜样。
    应我国政府邀请来我国帮助建设的苏联专家，在我国各方面的建设事业中发挥了卓越的作用。我国有许多规模巨大的建设工程，如治淮工程、荆江分洪工程、成渝铁路、天兰铁路、阜新煤矿以及最近竣工的鞍钢无缝钢管厂、西安第二火力发电厂等，都是在苏联专家的帮助与指导下完成的，还有许多正在建设的巨大工程也在苏联专家的帮助与指导之下进行着。在我国经济机关、文化机关及其他机关工作的苏联专家都有卓越的贡献。苏联专家的工作受到了中国广大劳动人民的爱戴。他们不仅帮助我们解决了许多困难的问题，而且给我们培养了大批优秀的干部。由于苏联专家的传授以及通过其他的途径，苏联先进经验在我国广泛地传播着，它们给我国的经济事业带来难以计算的好处。
    四年多来，中苏两国的文化交流同样日益频繁。苏联的先进文化，帮助了我国文化事业的前进。
    列宁、斯大林的经典著作这几年来在我国广泛地传播着。列宁的著作自一九四九年十月到一九五二年底印数共达二百一十三万五千余册。斯大林的著作从一九四九年到一九五三年六月，印数达六百七十多万册。而“斯大林全集”的开始出版，更是我国出版事业中的一个重大的事件。
    苏联的具有高度教育意义的文学艺术受到我国人民群众，特别是青年的热爱。苏联各种影片也在我国人民群众中拥有广大的观众。从一九四九年到今年六月，观众总数达五亿多人。
    为了培养各方面的建设人才，我们往苏联派遣了大批的留学生，现在共有一千余人，今后还要更多地派遣。我国留学生在苏联各方面的亲切照顾下，在苏联教师的热心教导和苏联同学的帮助下，再加上自己的努力，一般都顺利地克服了种种困难，而取得优良的学习成绩。
    我国各地文化团体和文化机关有许多已和苏联方面同样性质的机构建立了联系。我国科学界在今年中国科学院访苏代表团归来以后，更进一步地认识到苏联科学的先进性和苏联科学研究工作结合国家建设需要的方向，开始认真地改进着自己的工作。我国医学界在广泛学习巴夫洛夫学说并推行苏联先进的医疗方法和医疗理论。苏联经验也是我国学校教育改革的重要指南。在学习苏联教育经验方面获得特别巨大的成就的是中国人民大学。
    苏联的社会主义和共产主义建设的各方面的成就，对于我国人民群众，是一个巨大的鼓舞的力量。伟大的苏联就是我国建设的光辉榜样。四年多来，随着中苏友谊的增进，随着我们国家建设事业的开展，我国人民学习苏联的运动在日益高涨。现在，摆在我们面前的任务是：在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。这就是在过渡时期内我们国家建设的总路线和总任务。在这个艰巨的任务面前，学习苏联的重要性就更为突出了。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召：
  “在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”几年来的经验无可置疑地证明，学习苏联，学习苏联的社会主义建设的经验，学习苏联的先进的科学技术，对于我们的各项工作都具有紧迫而重大的意义。这是因为从基本的意义来说，十月革命以后苏联所走过的道路也就是我们现在要走的道路。学习苏联就是学习正确地建设我们伟大祖国的本领，就是学习实现国家建设总路线和总任务的本领。为要学习得好，我们必须克服保守思想和自满情绪，而以高度的革命热情和科学的求实精神，结合国家建设的任务，诚心诚意地孜孜不倦地进行学习，除此以外，我们还要学习苏联人民在社会主义建设时期那种艰苦奋斗的精神，以个人的眼前的、局部的利益服从国家建设的根本的、长远的、整体的利益，来完成我们新的伟大的历史任务。
    中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结不仅是加速我国建设的可靠保证，而且是保卫远东和世界和平的最强大的力量。过去几年来的事实完全证明了毛泽东主席的话：“中苏两国强大的同盟是不可战胜的力量，是反对帝国主义侵略和维护远东和平及安全的坚强保证，也是争取世界和平的伟大事业胜利的保证。”美帝国主义发动的侵朝战争的失败是一个最有说服力的例子。由于朝中人民在苏联及全世界爱好和平人民支援下的英勇奋斗，由于苏联为和平解决朝鲜问题进行了不懈的努力，朝鲜停战终于违背美帝国主义的意志得到了实现。帝国主义者在远东这一冒险的可耻下场，说明了由于中苏友好同盟的强大存在，由于亚洲各国人民的团结一致，帝国主义者在东方横行霸道的时代已经永远地结束了。毫无疑问，中苏两国的坚强团结，在争取世界持久和平和缓和国际局势的斗争中将取得更大的成就。正如马林科夫和莫洛托夫同志所说的：“苏联人民和中华人民共和国人民的伟大同盟和兄弟般的友谊，今后仍然是保证远东的和平与安全和巩固世界和平的可靠基础。”
    中苏友好协会的工作，随着我国人民群众学习苏联运动的高涨，几年来也有了巨大的进展。现在，中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国合作社联合总社等拥有广大会员群众的团体都已经加入中苏友好协会为团体会员，因而使中苏友好协会的工作获得更广大的群众基础。
    同志们，所有的事实都说明了中苏友好的事业的光辉成就。中苏友谊不仅深入了中苏两国七亿以上人民的心里，而且得到了全世界进步人类的热烈拥护，看作是有关自己切身利益的事业。我们的友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽的，是真正无敌的。帝国主义战争贩子们的任何阴谋诡计将继续在我们的强大的友好同盟面前被粉碎，这是肯定无疑的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    中苏两国人民的伟大的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以马林科夫同志为首的苏联领袖们万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
