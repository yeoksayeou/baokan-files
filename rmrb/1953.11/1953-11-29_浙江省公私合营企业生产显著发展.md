Zhejiang Province's Joint State-Private Enterprises Show Significant Production Development

Over the past four years, with the rapid growth of socialist elements in the national economy, Zhejiang Province's joint state-private enterprises have also experienced considerable development. Currently, there are 73 joint state-private factories in the province, employing 38,748 workers.

Most of these joint state-private factories were formed after the People's Government confiscated bureaucratic capital or the property of enemy, puppet, and counter-revolutionary elements; a small number were private factories that faced operational difficulties and were merged with government support and investment. After these factories became joint state-private enterprises, under the leadership of the state share, the worker masses were mobilized, democratic reforms and production reforms were implemented, counter-revolutionary elements and feudal foremen lurking in the factories were eliminated, organizational structures and management systems were consolidated and improved, democratic management was implemented, and business practices were transformed, gradually bringing them into the orbit of national planning. For example, after the Datong Electrochemical Plant became a joint state-private enterprise, the Shanghai General Management Office, which specialized in speculation, was abolished, the seven sections in the factory were reduced to four, labor organization was adjusted, various necessary production management systems and operating procedures were established, and planned management was implemented, resulting in significant improvements in production.

Due to the changes in production relations after the establishment of joint state-private enterprises, the worker masses further unleashed their production enthusiasm and creativity, resulting in thriving production in all aspects. For example, the Jinhua Soy Sauce Factory in Zhejiang produced 400 vats of soy sauce annually before becoming a joint state-private enterprise; after the merger, annual production increased to 2,000 vats, a fourfold increase.

With the improvement in production, the financial situation of each factory also completely changed, and all achieved surpluses. For example, the Hangzhou Power Plant suffered a loss of 490 million yuan in 1949 (before becoming a joint state-private enterprise), but in 1950 (after the merger) it achieved a surplus of 7.9 billion yuan, which increased to 18.9 billion yuan in 1951 and 26 billion yuan in the first half of 1953. Due to the annual surpluses, the number of employees in most factories increased compared to the past, and many facilities were improved and added. The confidence of private shareholders also increased. For example, the Hangzhou Match Factory now has 111 percent more employees than in the early days of the joint state-private enterprise, and its capital has expanded more than tenfold. The Datong Electrochemical Plant added six workshops, a soda-lye stove, and purchased a new motor, power generation equipment, and eight bleaching powder tanks. The Hangzhou Match Factory converted all machine power to motors and added ventilation, safety, and sanitation equipment, initially improving the working conditions of employees.

In addition, most joint state-private factories have established and improved their boards of directors, and major issues concerning the enterprise are resolved through consultation, thereby leveraging the enthusiasm of private shareholders. For example, the Datong Electrochemical Plant established a board of directors in October 1952, with five directors representing the state share and two representing the private share, based on shareholding ratios, and established a meeting system. Specific divisions of labor were implemented in operation and management, and private representatives had responsibilities and authority, and were able to obtain considerable surpluses, dividends, and bonuses, which made them very satisfied. Xu Rijin, a private representative of the Hangzhou Match Factory, said at the board meeting: "I have not made a mistake in the path I have taken, and I will definitely do everything in my power to run the enterprise well." The above situation shows that joint state-private enterprises are far superior to private enterprises. After the establishment of joint state-private enterprises, not only are the enterprises brought into the orbit of the national economic plan, which is beneficial to national construction and the people's lives, but also allows private industrialists and merchants to obtain profits and steadily complete the socialist transformation.

    浙江省公私合营企业生产显著发展
    四年来，随着国民经济中社会主义成分的迅速增长，浙江省公私合营的企业也有了相当的发展。目前全省共有公私合营工厂七十三家，职工三万八千七百四十八人。
    这些公私合营的工厂大部分是人民政府没收了企业中的官僚资本或敌伪、反革命分子的财产因而变为公私合营的；一少部分是私营工厂经营困难，经政府扶植投资而合营的。这些工厂公私合营后，在公股的领导下，发动职工群众，贯彻了民主改革与生产改革，清除了潜伏在厂内的反革命分子和封建把头，整顿与健全了组织机构和管理制度，实行了民主管理，并转变了经营作风，有步骤地使其纳入国家计划的轨道。如大同电化厂公私合营后，撤销了专作投机买卖的上海总管理处，把厂内七个课改为四个课，调整了劳动组织，建立了各种必要的生产管理制度与操作规程，推行了计划管理，因而生产获得显著好转。
    公私合营后由于生产关系的改变，职工群众进一步发挥了生产积极性和创造性，因而生产都蒸蒸日上。如浙江金华酱油厂公私合营前年产酱油四百缸，公私合营后年产酱油二千缸，比公私合营前提高了四倍。
    随着生产的好转，各厂财务情况也完全改观，并都获得了盈余。如杭州电厂一九四九年（公私合营前）亏损四亿九千万元，到一九五零年（公私合营后）盈余七十九亿元，一九五一年增至一百八十九亿元，一九五三年上半年增至二百六十亿元。由于逐年获得盈余，大多数工厂的职工人数较前增加了，并且改善和增加了不少设备，私股股东的经营信心也提高了。如杭州火柴厂现有职工比公私合营初期增加了百分之一百十一，资金扩大了十倍以上；大同电化厂增建了工场六间、碱水灶一座，并购置了新马达及发电设备一套，漂粉缸八只等。杭州火柴厂机器动力都改用马达，并添置了通风、安全卫生设备，初步改善了职工的劳动条件。
    此外，大部分公私合营工厂都建立和健全了董事会，有关企业的重大问题都通过协商方式解决，从而发挥了私股股东的积极性。如大同电化厂在一九五二年十月建立了董事会，按股权比例产生了公股董事五人，私股董事二人，并建立了会议制度。在经营管理上实行了具体分工，私股代表有职有权，又能得到不少盈余、股息和红利，因而他们很满意。杭州火柴厂私股代表徐日廑在董事会上说：“我走的路没有错，我一定尽自己的一切力量把企业办好。”上述情况说明：公私合营企业比私营企业优越得多，公私合营后不但使企业纳入国家经济计划的轨道，对国家建设和人民生活都有益，而且可以使私营工商业者有利可得，并稳步地完成社会主义的改造。
