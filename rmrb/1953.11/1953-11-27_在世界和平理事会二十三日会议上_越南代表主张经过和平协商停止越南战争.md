Xinhua News Agency, Vienna (Delayed Dispatch) The Vietnamese representative to the World Peace Council meeting, Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, spoke on the peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue at the World Peace Council's 23rd meeting. The full text is as follows:

    Chairman, Esteemed Council Members, Friends:

    After the cessation of the Korean War, the only large-scale war remaining in the world is the war in Vietnam. As we are discussing here how to ease international tensions, this war is being waged fiercely, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

    The Vietnam War was imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French colonial rulers. Eight years ago, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in August 1945, the Vietnamese people, who had suffered greatly from the ravages of the Japanese aggressors and fought for many years in the Anti-Japanese War, established their own republic under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh. The Vietnamese people longed to be free from colonial status and to heal the wounds of war and rebuild their homeland in a peaceful environment. The democratic government under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh was established in vast areas of the country, including major cities such as Hanoi and Saigon, as well as coastal and mountainous regions. The government under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh received the unanimous trust of the National Assembly elected in January 1946 and became the sole legal government. However, French imperialism did not abandon its ambition to rebuild its colonial rule in Vietnam. Although the French government signed agreements with the government under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh twice between March and September 1946, later facts proved that the French colonialists used these two negotiations and agreements to deceive public opinion and buy time to prepare for a full-scale attack on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After repeatedly violating the agreements, in December 1946, the French colonialists launched a full-scale attack on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, forcing the Vietnamese people to rise up and wage a heroic and comprehensive people's liberation war.

    At the beginning of the war, the French colonialists were confident that they could quickly destroy the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and reconquer the Vietnamese people. However, the course of the war showed that the French colonialists' wishful thinking was wrong. For the sake of the independence, democracy, and peace of their motherland, the Vietnamese people persisted in resisting the aggression of the French army. During the eight years of war, the Vietnamese people closely united around the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh, mobilized the strength of the whole country, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and became stronger as they fought. Relying on the support of the people and constantly seizing the equipment of the French colonial army to strengthen themselves, the Vietnamese People's Army has now become a strong people's army. The Vietnamese People's Army has been tempered in the severe flames of war and liberated large areas of land. Facts have proved that a nation that is awakened and fighting to defend its independence and freedom cannot be defeated by any powerful foreign army.

    The French colonialists not only failed to realize their ambition to rule the Vietnamese people but also suffered serious losses in the war. In the past few years of war, more than 330,000 French troops were killed, wounded, and captured, and a large amount of equipment was destroyed and seized by the People's Army. The Vietnam War has become a bottomless pit for French finances, with the cost of the Vietnam War this year reaching an astonishing 600 billion francs. Every day the Vietnam War continues, France's losses increase.

    The war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is clearly against the interests of the French people. Therefore, for several years, this war has been opposed by the French people. Not long ago, there was a movement involving broad social strata in France demanding an end to the Vietnam War, which fully reflected the wishes of the good men and women of France. On behalf of the peace-loving Vietnamese people, I would like to extend my heartfelt respect to our French friends.

    The war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam waged by the French colonialists has brought deep suffering to the French people. Even some people in the ruling clique have had to admit that this war is not worth the candle. Now, except for a few unscrupulous people who faithfully pursue the policy of the American imperialists to continue and expand this war, and those who want to make a fortune from the war and maintain their colonial investment interests, almost all people from all walks of life in France see that now is the time to stop the Vietnam War through peace talks.

    The realization of the Korean armistice has strengthened the belief of the French people, the Vietnamese people, and the peace-loving people of the world in stopping this evil war and resolving the Vietnam issue peacefully. The realization of the Korean armistice powerfully shows that all international disputes can be resolved through negotiation. The peace-loving people all over the world are paying close attention to the serious situation in which the Vietnamese people are still suffering from the disaster of a large-scale war of aggression with great concern. Calls and actions to stop this war of aggression and to resolve this issue through peaceful negotiation are developing more and more forcefully within France and around the world.

    However, the American imperialists and a small number of French colonialists do not think so. After being forced to cease fire in Korea, American imperialism has been particularly interested in the war of aggression in Vietnam. Eisenhower and Dulles also openly came out to encourage the French colonialists to continue fighting, and after the $400 million aid appropriation, they quickly invested another $385 million. Recently, Nixon also personally went to Saigon and Hanoi to carry out conspiracies. Why is American imperialism so enthusiastic about this evil war? Obviously, it is for the profits of American arms dealers, to gradually acquire the position of French imperialism in Indochina by using the method of "you provide the people, I provide the money", to continue to maintain international tension, and to expand new aggression. Within France, reactionary colonialists are attempting to continue this evil war after obtaining new assistance from American imperialism, vainly attempting to finally conquer the Vietnamese people. Just before our council meeting, the French colonial army launched a so-called "Seagull Battle" in the Red River Delta region of North Vietnam. They boasted about how victorious they were, but the opposite was true. The French colonial army was resisted at every turn by the Vietnamese People's Army in this so-called "offensive", and after 20 days of fighting, they lost nearly 4,000 people and retreated to their original starting point. Now the enemy is anxiously worrying about the arrival of the Vietnamese People's Army's devastating blow to them.

    The conspiracy of American and French imperialism to continue and expand this war is bound to fail. The eight years of the Vietnam War, like the three years of the Korean War, have proved that any attempt to resolve international disputes by force is bound to fail. If the American and French imperialists dare to do so and continue to wage the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will, as in the past, under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, resolutely fight to defend the independence and freedom of the Vietnamese nation and have the confidence to achieve final victory.

    The war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by American and French imperialism is currently the only large-scale ongoing war in the world. This not only causes incalculable losses to the people of Vietnam and France but also threatens and undermines peace in the Far East and the world. The increasingly urgent demand of good men and women all over the world to stop this war is completely justified.

    The Korean War has already been stopped on the basis of peaceful negotiation. It is absolutely necessary and also possible to stop the Vietnam War and resolve the Vietnam issue through peaceful negotiation. We Vietnamese people long for peace, and we advocate stopping the Vietnam War and resolving the Vietnam issue through peaceful negotiation. This is because it is the universal desire of the people of the world and it is also in the interests of the people of Vietnam and France. For eight years, the Vietnamese people have persisted in resisting the French colonial army in order to defend the independence and freedom of our people so that our people can live and build in a peaceful environment. Recently, the telegram from the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace to the French National Peace Council also expressed once again the respect of the peace-loving Vietnamese people for the French people's struggle against this dirty war.

    Friends, let us all work together to stop the Vietnam War, to smash any conspiracy of imperialism to continue the Vietnam War, to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue, to ease international tensions, and to strive for peace in the Far East and the world!

    Finally, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, I would like to express my gratitude to the French people and the peace-loving people of the world for their positive advocacy of the just action of peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue.

    On behalf of the Vietnamese people, I hope that: 1. The World Peace Council calls on the people of the world to condemn the crimes of American and French imperialism in attempting to continue and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam; 2. The World Peace Council calls on the people of the world to launch a powerful movement to stop the Vietnam War through negotiation and to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue.

    I believe that the power of peace is great, and peace can defeat war.

### 在世界和平理事会二十三日会议上  越南代表主张经过和平协商停止越南战争

    在世界和平理事会二十三日会议上
    越南代表主张经过和平协商停止越南战争
    【新华社维也纳讯】（迟到）出席世界和平理事会会议的越南代表、越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探，在世界和平理事会二十三日会议上就和平解决越南问题发言，全文如下：主席、各位理事先生、各位朋友们：
    在朝鲜战争停止后，世界上现存的唯一的大规模的战争就是在越南的战争。当我们在这里讨论如何缓和国际紧张局势的时候，这个战争正在激烈地进行着，严重地威胁着远东和世界和平。
    越南战争是法国殖民统治者强加在越南人民身上的。八年以前，当抗日战争胜利结束后，在一九四五年八月，备嚐日本侵略者蹂躏之苦并进行了多年抗日战争的越南人民，在胡志明主席的领导下，建立了自己的共和国。越南人民渴望从此摆脱殖民地的地位，能在和平的环境中医治战争的创伤，重建自己的家园。在胡志明主席领导下的民主政权，就在全国广大地区，包括河内、西贡等大城市及沿海地区和山区建立起来了。胡志明主席领导下的政府得到了一九四六年一月所选出的国民议会的一致信任，并成了唯一的合法政府。但是法国帝国主义并没有放弃在越南重建其殖民地统治的野心。虽然法国政府在一九四六年三月到九月间曾两次和胡志明主席领导下的政府签订了协定，但是后来的事实证明，法国殖民主义者是利用这两次谈判和协定欺骗舆论，争取时间来准备发动对越南民主共和国的全面进攻。多次破坏协定之后，到了一九四六年十二月，法国殖民主义者对越南民主共和国发动了全面进攻，迫使越南人民不得不起而进行英勇的全面的人民解放战争。
    战争爆发之初，法国殖民主义者满以为很快就可以摧毁越南民主共和国，重新征服越南人民。但是战争的进程表明，法国殖民主义者的如意算盘打错了。越南人民为了祖国的独立、民主与和平，坚持反抗法国军队的侵略。在八年的战争过程中，越南人民紧紧地团结在以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府周围，动员全国力量，克服种种困难，越战越强。越南人民军依靠人民的支持，并不断的缴获法国殖民军队的装备来加强自己，现在已成为一支强大的人民军队。越南人民军在严重的战争的烽火中得到了锻炼，解放了大块国土。事实证明，觉醒起来的为捍卫自己的独立和自由而斗争的民族，是任何强大的外国军队所不能战胜的。
    法国殖民主义者不仅没有能够实现它的统治越南人民的野心，反而在战争中遭受严重的损失。法军在几年的战争中被打死、打伤和俘掳的共达三十三万多人，大批的装备被人民军击毁和缴获了。越南战争已成了法国财政上的无底洞，今年用在越南战争中的费用已达到六千亿法郎的惊人数目。越南战争继续一天，法国这种损失就加重一天。
    侵略越南民主共和国的战争，显然是违反法国人民的利益的。所以数年来，这个战争都被法国人民所反对。不久以前，还有法国广泛社会阶层参加的要求停止越南战争的运动，充分反映了法国善良男女的意愿。我代表爱好和平的越南人民，谨向法国朋友致衷心的敬意。
    法国殖民主义者所进行的对越南民主共和国的侵略战争，给法国人民带来深重的灾难。甚至统治集团中的一部分人士，也不得不承认这个战争得不偿失。现在除了一部分丧心病狂，忠实奉行美帝国主义者想继续维持和扩大这场战争政策的人，以及想发战争财和保持自己殖民地投资利益的人以外，几乎所有法国各阶层人士，都看到现在正是经过和谈停止越南战争的时候了。
    朝鲜停战的实现，加强了法国人民、越南人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，对停止这一罪恶战争以和平解决越南问题的信念。朝鲜停战的实现，有力地说明一切国际争端都可以用协商方式来求得解决。全世界爱好和平的人民，正以极大的关怀密切注视着越南人民还在继续遭受大规模侵略战争灾难的严重局势。希望停止这个侵略战争，要求以和平协商的方式解决这一问题的呼声和行动，正在法国内部和全世界日益有力地发展着。
    但是，美帝国主义和法国少数殖民主义者的想法却不是这样。美帝国主义在朝鲜被迫停战以后，对越南的侵略战争就特别感到兴趣。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯也公开出来鼓励法国殖民者打下去，在四亿美元援助拨款后，很快又投入了三亿八千五百万美元的赌注。最近尼克松也亲自到西贡、河内去进行阴谋活动。美帝国主义为什么这样热中于这个罪恶的战争呢？显然是为了美国军火商的利润，为了用“我出钱你出人”的办法，来逐步取得法帝国主义者在印度支那的地位，来继续保持国际紧张局势，来扩张新的侵略。在法国内部，反动的殖民主义者，企图在取得美帝国主义新的援助后，把这个罪恶战争继续下去，妄想最后征服越南人民。就在我们的理事会开会前不久，法国殖民军队还在北越红河三角洲地区发动了一次所谓“海鸥战”，他们大肆吹嘘如何胜利，但事实恰恰相反，法国殖民军队在这次所谓“进攻”中遭到了越南人民军节节抗击，经过二十天的战斗损失了近四千人又败退到原来的出发地了。现在敌人正惶惶不安地担心着越南人民军对他们的毁灭性的打击的到来。
    美、法帝国主义想继续和扩大这个战争的阴谋是一定要失败的。八年的越南战争，正如三年的朝鲜战争一样证明了：任何以武力解决国际纠纷的企图是必然要失败的。如果美、法帝国主义者敢于这样做和继续进行侵略越南的战争的话，越南人民将如过去一样，在越南民主共和国政府和胡主席的领导下，为保卫越南民族的独立和自由而坚决打下去，并且有信心获得最后的胜利。
    美、法帝国主义对越南民主共和国的侵略战争，是目前世界上唯一大规模的现行战争。这不仅使越、法两国人民遭受不可计算的损失，同时也威胁着和破坏着远东和世界和平。全世界善良男女日益迫切地要求停止这个战争是完全有理由的。
    朝鲜战争已经在和平协商的基础上停止了。经过和平协商的方法停止越南战争，是完全必要的而且也是可能的。我们越南人民是渴望和平的，我们主张用和平协商的方法停止越南战争，和平解决越南问题。因为这是全世界人民的普遍意愿，也适合越、法两国人民的利益。越南人民八年来坚持抗击法国殖民军队，为的是保卫我国人民的独立和自由，使我国人民能够在和平的环境中生活下去并进行建设。最近，越南人民保卫世界和平委员会致法国全国和平理事会的电报，也表示了爱好和平的越南人民又一次对于法国人民反对这个肮脏战争的斗争的敬意。
    各位朋友：让我们大家一起为停止越南战争，为粉碎帝国主义继续越南战争的任何阴谋，为和平解决越南问题，为缓和国际紧张局势，为远东和世界的和平而奋斗吧！
    最后，让我代表越南人民向法国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民积极主张和平解决越南问题的正义行动，表示谢意。
    我代表越南人民希望：一、世界和平理事会号召全世界人民对美、法帝国主义者企图继续和扩大侵略越南战争的罪行进行谴责；二、世界和平理事会号召全世界人民发起一个经过协商停止越南战争、和平解决越南问题的有力的运动。
    我相信和平的力量是伟大的，和平是可以战胜战争的。
