    For several years, the People's Government has actively supported the development of agricultural production, vigorously organized purchasing, transportation, sales, and lending, and supplied grain to factories, government agencies, the military, schools, urban residents, farmers in economic crop areas, rural households lacking grain, and disaster victims. This has severely struck grain speculation profiteers who hoard and speculate to reap exorbitant profits, fundamentally changing the situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, where grain prices fluctuated daily and people lived in constant anxiety. This has stabilized prices, promoted the rapid recovery and development of China's economic construction, and ensured the gradual improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of people in both urban and rural areas.
    With the strong support of the People's Government and the efforts of all farmers, by 1952, China's grain sown area and output had exceeded the highest levels in Chinese history. Although some areas suffered disasters this year, most areas still had bumper harvests. The total national grain output is only slightly more than in 1952, but much higher than in 1951, 1950, and before liberation. As long as the state controls the grain supply, transports it properly, and uses it rationally, the people in both urban and rural areas can obtain sufficient food. This is the People's Government's policy on grain work, and it fully conforms to the greatest and common interests of the people of the whole country. However, grain speculators, who are mad and only care about profit, are taking the opportunity to disrupt people's minds and engage in speculation and profiteering, undermining the state's grain purchasing plan and supply work, while the state vigorously buys grain and regulates supply. These scum who endanger the lives of the broad masses of people are hated by the people of the whole country and opposed by legitimate industrialists and businessmen.
    The first crime of grain speculators is to undermine the state's grain price policy. We know that the state's grain purchasing price is beneficial to both farmers who sell grain and urban and rural people who buy grain. However, some grain speculators take advantage of the difficulty farmers face when crops are not yet ripe, depress prices, and pre-purchase from farmers. In Tongcheng Gate, Anhui Province, a group of grain merchants lent nearly 300 million yuan in green rice to farmers before the autumn harvest this year. Calculated according to the state's grain purchase price, the loss caused to farmers by speculators reached about 150 million yuan. In Nancheng and other counties in Jiangxi Province, private merchants pre-purchased grain from farmers in August this year, with prices generally one-third or more than half lower than the state's listed price. In Leshan, Longchang, Meishan and other places in Sichuan Province, grain merchants rushed to buy yellow rice from farmers and suppressed grain prices when autumn grain was just on the market, with some rice selling for 10,000 yuan less than the listed price per stone. During the same period, in Tanjiqiao, Echeng, Hubei, grain speculators intercepted rice at a price 2,000 yuan higher than the listed price per 100 jin, while each dan of rice was reduced by 14 jin by a large scale, causing significant losses to farmers.
    For their selfish purposes, grain speculators also try their best to deceive farmers and provoke relations between farmers and the state. They said to the farmers: "My price is high, you sell to me." Or they spread rumors: "The state is not buying anymore, you sell to me." Speculative grain merchants in Cihua Town, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, openly made the following request: "We will collect it in the morning, and the Grain Bureau will collect it in the afternoon." Liu Yongqing, a businessman in Funing County, Jiangsu Province, gathered more than 90 grain merchants to "sue" the cooperative in a joint name to the county people's government in order to compete with the cooperative for grain purchases, claiming that the cooperative "monopolized the market," and clamored that the cooperative should not set up stations in the local area to buy grain, and that the cooperative should buy grain in other places, and let the local grain be purchased by private merchants. The speculative grain merchants in Yongxingji, the county, set up collection points everywhere and surrounded the cooperative. As a result, 80% of the local grain was purchased by private merchants. Because these illegal activities of grain speculators have not been effectively cracked down on, some areas have seen private merchants who were not originally engaged in grain business also purchase grain across industries and hoard and speculate. In some areas, after the government strengthened market management, grain merchants broke themselves up into smaller units and went deep into the countryside, forming alliances with relatives and friends to carry out panic buying. This illegal behavior of speculative grain merchants to undermine the state's grain purchasing work has also fueled the psychology of surplus grain households in rural areas to store and wait for high prices, so they are unwilling to sell grain to the state quickly.
    In the sales market, speculative grain merchants also undermine the state's grain supply work in many ways, illegally purchase state grain, and then raise grain prices to exploit workers, urban citizens and other consumers. Unlawful grain merchants in the Hequn East Store in Beiguan, Xi'an City, colluded with speculative grain merchants in Gaoling, Sanyuan, Jingyang and other counties in the autumn of this year to hire children and housewives at 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per day to take turns to buy flour from state-owned companies. Some illegal grain merchants, after purchasing state grain, resold it at a price of 560 yuan per catty higher than the listed price. A steamed bun shop on Dagu Road in Tianjin purchased a large amount of flour from state-owned grain companies and hoarded 500 to 600 bags in order to make huge profits. Private merchants in Wuhan colluded with private merchants in Hunan to purchase and transport more than 2,000 bags of flour. Zuo Xinchun, manager of Beijing's private Xinfeng Mill and a grain speculation profiteer, colluded with corrupt elements to embezzle public funds and purchase more than 50,000 jin of wheat bran from the Beijing Grain Company for reselling. Speculative grain merchants also transported a large amount of flour from Beijing to various parts of Hebei Province and raised the price of flour to sell it at 7,000 yuan to 24,000 yuan higher than the retail price in Beijing to make huge profits. The Beijing Tianqiao Grain Market usually only sells 100,000 jin of rice per day, which is enough, but recently it has often exceeded this number several times. For example, on October 31, 330,000 jin of rice were sold in one day, of which 250,000 jin were snapped up by grain speculators and transported to other places.
    From the above facts, if grain merchants are allowed to continue speculation, the result will seriously affect the state's grain purchasing plan and supply work, which is not conducive to farmers who produce grain and consumers, nor is it conducive to the state's planned economic construction. Therefore, in order to protect people's lives and ensure the country's economic construction, we must resolutely fight against grain speculation profiteers, and stop and eliminate grain speculation.
    The phenomenon of grain speculation fully demonstrates the necessity of restricting the development of urban and rural capitalism ("regulating capital"). Article 37 of the Common Program stipulates: "Freedom of domestic trade shall be implemented within the unified economic plan of the state, but speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited. State-owned trade agencies shall be responsible for regulating supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting people's cooperative undertakings." It can be seen that, first, commercial activities, whether buying or selling, must obey the unified economic plan of the state; grain commerce, which is closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, must obey the plan; second, speculative commerce that disrupts the market, such as the commerce engaged in grain speculation, must be strictly prohibited; third, in order to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices, state-owned trade agencies have the right and the obligation to take all necessary measures.
    Eliminating grain speculation is not only related to national construction and market prices, but also to the daily lives of all urban and rural people, and also to the foundation of our country -- the worker-peasant alliance. Lenin once pointed out in his article "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat": "The peasant economy is still an economy of small commodity production. There is a very broad and deeply rooted foundation of capitalism here. On this basis, capitalism can be preserved and revived, and it is inevitable that it will have a very cruel struggle with communism. The form of this struggle is to oppose the state's purchase of grain (and other agricultural products) through the activities of speculators and profiteers, and in general, to oppose the state's distribution of agricultural products." The grain speculation that has appeared in our country today essentially reflects the contradiction between capitalist elements and socialist elements, and reflects the destruction and attack of capitalist forces on the socialist economy and the worker-peasant alliance. We must resolutely crack down on the crimes of these grain speculation profiteers. This is certainly unfavorable to grain speculators, but it is completely beneficial to national construction and people's lives, and it is completely beneficial to the working class, the broad masses of peasants, and the alliance between workers and peasants, and therefore it will certainly be unanimously supported by the broad masses of people.
    Strengthening the management of the grain market is one of the effective weapons to combat speculative grain merchants. This is not only the task of the industrial and commercial administrative departments, but all the people, including the staff and workers of the grain industry and commerce, should also actively assist the people's government, monitor and report the grain speculation activities of illegal elements. Only under the supervision of all the people can we effectively stop and eliminate grain speculation, stabilize grain prices, ensure the purchase and supply of grain, and ensure the smooth progress of the state's planned economic construction.

### 消灭粮食投机，保障国家建设

    消灭粮食投机，保障国家建设
    几年以来，人民政府积极扶助农业生产的发展，并大力组织收购、调运、销售和贷放，把粮食供应给工厂、机关、军队、学校、城市居民、经济作物地区的农民、农村的缺粮户和灾民，沉重地打击了囤积居奇牟取暴利的粮食投机奸商，根本上改变了国民党反动统治时期的那种粮价天天波动、人民生活皇皇不可终日的局面，从而稳定了物价，促进了我国经济建设的迅速恢复和发展，保障了我国城乡广大人民生活的逐步改善。
    在人民政府的大力扶植和全体农民的努力之下，到一九五二年，我国粮食播种的面积和产量都超过了中国历史上的最高水平。今年虽然有一部分地区遭受灾害，但是大多数地方还是丰收，全国粮食总产量比一九五二年只多不少，比一九五一年、一九五○年和解放前的产量都高得多。只要国家掌握了粮食，调运得当，使用合理，城市和农村的人民都可以得到足够的食粮。这是人民政府关于粮食工作的方针，它完全符合于全国人民最大的和共同的利益。但是，丧心病狂、唯利是图的粮食奸商，在国家大力买粮和调剂供应的时候，却乘机扰乱人心，投机倒把，破坏国家的买粮计划和供应工作。这些危害广大人民生活的害群之马，是全国人民所痛恨的，也是正当的工商业者所反对的。
    粮食投机奸商的罪行首先是破坏国家的粮食价格政策。我们知道：国家买粮的价格是既有利于卖粮的农民，也有利于买粮的城乡人民。但有些粮食奸商却乘着农民青黄不接的困难时候，压低价格，向农民预购。安徽省铜城闸一批粮商在今年秋收以前对农民放出稻青近三亿元，按照国家买粮时的牌价计算，农民受奸商剥削所造成的损失达一亿五千万元左右。江西省南城等县私商在今年八月间预购农民的粮食，价格一般都比国家的牌价低三分之一或者一半以上。四川省的乐山、隆昌、眉山等处，粮商在今年秋粮刚刚上市的时候，抢着向农民收买黄谷，压低粮价，有的一石谷子低于牌价一万元。同一期间，湖北鄂城谭家桥，粮食投机奸商以每百斤高于牌价二千元的价格截购稻谷，而每担稻谷都被大秤压低十四斤，使农民受到重大损失。
    粮食投机奸商为了自私自利的目的，还千方百计地欺骗农民，挑拨农民和国家的关系。他们向农民说：“我的价钱高，你卖给我。”或者造谣说：“国家不买了，你卖给我。”湖北省当阳县慈化镇投机粮商竟公然提出这样的要求：“上午由我们收，下午由粮食局收。”江苏省阜宁县商人刘永青为了和合作社争购粮食，竟纠集九十余户粮商到县人民政府联名“控告”合作社，声称合作社“垄断市场”，并扬言不准合作社在本地设站买粮，要合作社到外地买粮，把本地粮食让给私商收购。该县永兴集的投机粮商遍设收购点，包围合作社，结果当地百分之八十的粮食为私商所收购。由于粮食投机商的这些非法活动没有受到应有的打击，有的地区就出现了原来不是经营粮食的私商，也跨行跨业购进粮食，囤积居奇。有的地区粮商在政府加强市场管理以后，便化整为零，深入农村，勾亲结友，进行抢购。投机奸商这种破坏国家买粮工作的不法行为，也就助长了农村中的余粮户贮存观望，等待高价的心理，因而不愿迅速地把粮食卖给国家。
    在销售市场上，投机奸商又多方破坏国家粮食供应工作，非法套购国家粮食，然后哄抬粮价，剥削工人、城市市民和其它消费者。西安市北关合群东店的不法粮商在今年秋天勾结高陵、三原、泾阳等县投机粮商，每日以二千元至三千元雇用小孩和家庭妇女，轮流到国营公司套买面粉。有些不法粮商套购了国家粮食后，转手就以每斤高出牌价五百六十元出售。天津大沽路一个包子铺套购国营粮食公司大量面粉，囤积五、六百袋，以图暴利。武汉私商和湖南私商勾结，套购外运面粉达二千多袋。北京市私营新丰磨坊经理、粮食投机奸商左新春勾结贪污分子盗用公款，套购北京市粮食公司麸皮五万多斤，进行倒卖。投机粮商并从北京运出大批面粉到河北省各地哄抬面粉价格，以超出北京市零售价七千元至两万四千元出售，牟取暴利。北京天桥粮食市场平时每天卖出的大米只要十万斤就够了，最近却常常超过这个数目几倍。比如十月三十一日的一天就销了大米三十三万斤，其中被粮食奸商抢购了二十五万斤，倒运到外地去。
    从以上事实来看，如果放任粮商继续进行投机，其结果，势必严重影响国家的买粮计划和供应工作，既不利于生产粮食的农民和消费者，也不利于国家有计划的经济建设。因此，为了保障人民生活，保障国家的经济建设，就必须坚决地和粮食投机奸商进行斗争，制止和消灭粮食投机行为。
    粮食投机的现象充分说明了限制城乡资本主义发展（“节制资本”）的必要性。共同纲领第三十七条规定：“在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。国营贸易机关应负调剂供求、稳定物价和扶助人民合作事业的责任。”由此可见，第一，商业的活动无论买卖，都必须服从国家统一的经济计划；密切关系国计民生的粮食商业更必须服从计划；第二，扰乱市场的投机商业例如经营粮食投机的商业必须严格取缔；第三，为了调剂供求，稳定物价，国营贸易机关有权利并有义务采取一切必要的措施。
    消灭粮食投机不但关系于国家建设和市场物价，关系于全体城乡人民每天的生活，而且关系于我们国家的基础——工农联盟。列宁在“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”一文中曾经指出：“农民经济仍旧是小商品生产的经济。这里有非常广阔，而且根深蒂固的资本主义基础。在这个基础上，资本主义得以保留和复活起来，当然是不免要同共产主义进行极残酷的斗争。这个斗争底形式就是经过投机小贩和奸商活动来反对国家采办粮食（以及其他农产品），一般就是反对由国家分配农产品。”我国今天出现的粮食投机，实质上就是反映了资本主义因素与社会主义因素之间的矛盾，反映了资本主义势力对于社会主义经济和工农联盟的破坏和进攻。对于这些粮食投机奸商的罪行我们必须给以坚决的打击。这样对于粮食投机者当然是不利的，但是这对于国家建设和人民生活却是完全有利的，对于工人阶级、广大农民和工农之间的联盟却是完全有利的，因而一定得到广大人民的一致拥护。
    加强粮食市场管理是打击投机粮商的有效武器之一。这不但是工商行政部门的任务，全体人民，包括粮食工商业的职工群众，也应积极协助人民政府，监视和检举不法分子的粮食投机活动。只有在全体人民的监视下，才能有效地制止和消灭粮食投机，稳定粮价，保障粮食的收购和供应，保障国家有计划经济建设的顺利进行。
