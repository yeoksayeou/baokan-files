Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: This reporter reports: Today, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides to the prisoners of war continued to be stalled, which is the tenth day since the fifth suspension. Since the explanation work began on October 15, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. side's special agents, the Korean and Chinese sides have only conducted more than 40 hours of explanation to the prisoners of war, while the interruption time of the explanation work has reached 31 days. The recently announced secret instructions from the U.S. side to the special agents clearly show that the U.S. side will continue to prevent the prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to the explanation, making the explanation work continue to be stalled, so as to completely destroy the explanation work in the end. Zhou Jingren, an old Chinese fisherman who returned from the No. 3 camp today, also confirmed this. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in the camp have been spreading rumors to the prisoners of war that "the explanation work is over, and everyone is preparing to go to Taiwan."

At the same time, the U.S. side and the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs, and even Swiss officials, are clamoring against extending the explanation period like toads in the fields after the rain. They unreasonably claimed that by January 22, regardless of whether the prisoners of war have listened to the explanation or whether the political conference is held, they will all be "released." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also publicly stated that at that time, the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war could be handed over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs as cannon fodder. This evil conspiracy of the U.S. side can also be confirmed from the secret instructions given by the U.S. side to the special agents. This instruction ordered the special agents to use all means to destroy the explanation work and prevent the prisoners of war from applying for repatriation, because this "will absolutely not extend" the explanation period. The secret instruction also said: "If the deadline is extended, the Republic of Korea is ready to mobilize national power to release anti-communist youths."

According to the Korean Armistice Agreement, prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should enjoy 90 days of explanation; prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after explanation should be resolved by the political conference within 30 days. Now, on the one hand, the U.S. side is directing the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents to carry out frantic sabotage and obstruction, making the explanation work stalled; on the other hand, in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, they are taking various excuses to obstruct the rapid reaching of an agreement, thereby delaying the convening of the political conference. The purpose is obviously to attempt to forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have never listened to the explanation and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs in the situation where the explanation period has been delayed and the political conference has not yet been convened. The agreement on the issue of prisoners of war is an important part of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by this destructive action.

### 解释工作继续陷于停顿

    解释工作继续陷于停顿
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：今天朝中方面对战俘的解释工作继续陷于停顿，这是第五次停顿以来的第十天。自十月十五日解释工作开始以来，由于美方特务的阻挠和破坏，朝中方面对战俘仅进行了四十多个小时的解释，而解释工作中断的时间已达三十一天。最近公布的美方给特务分子的秘密指令，清楚地表明：美方将继续阻止战俘出营场听取解释，使得解释工作继续停顿下去，以便最后完全破坏解释工作。今天从第三号营场遣返归来的一个中国老渔民周景仁也证实了这一点。他说，营场里的蒋匪特务已在对战俘放出“解释工作已经完蛋，大家准备到台湾去”的谣言。
    与此同时，美方和蒋、李匪帮以至瑞士的官员们像雨后田间的蛤蟆一样，此起彼落地叫嚣反对顺延解释期限，横蛮无理地声称，到一月二十二日，不管战俘是否听过解释，政治会议是否召开，就要将他们全部“释放”。美国国务卿杜勒斯还公然声称，到那时，朝中战俘就可以移交给李、蒋匪帮充当炮灰。美方的这个罪恶阴谋也可以从美方给特务分子的秘密指令得到证实。这件指令命令特务分子用一切手段破坏解释工作和阻止战俘申请遣返，因为这“绝对不会延长”解释期限。这件秘密指令还说：“如果期限被延长，大韩民国已作好发动国力释放反共青年的准备”。
    根据朝鲜停战协定规定，不直接遣返的战俘应享有九十天的解释；经解释后未行使遣返权利的战俘应由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。现在，美方一方面指挥李蒋特务进行疯狂破坏和阻挠，使得解释工作陷于停顿；另一方面在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的会议上，采取种种藉口阻挠迅速达成协议，借此拖延政治会议的召开，其目的显然是企图在解释期限已被拖过，而政治会议尚未能召开的情况下，把两万多名始终没有听过解释的朝中战俘加以强迫扣留，移交给蒋、李匪帮。关于战俘问题的协议是朝鲜停战协定的重要组成部分，美方对这种破坏行动所引起的严重后果必须负完全责任。
