Strengthen Economic Work in Grain Procurement

Recently, after extensively publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period to farmers, many farmers enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. Some farmers, who had previously been misled by unscrupulous merchants and deceived, have now awakened. For example, Liu Changfu, a farmer from Huoshenmiao Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, used to believe the rumors of unscrupulous merchants and hoarded grain, waiting for a high price to sell. After listening to the propaganda from the grain purchasing team, he said: "I will never betray my relatives to side with enemies, or forget the country to favor unscrupulous merchants. I, Liu Changfu, had only vegetables and grass in my stomach for decades, and it was only under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government that I began to eat grain. In a few more years, life will be even better." He immediately sold more than 700 jin of surplus grain to the purchasing team. This shows that as long as we explain the general line to the farmers, broaden their horizons, clarify the confused thinking of some farmers, and make them see the bright and splendid future of the country and themselves, they will be able to enthusiastically support the country's economic construction.

However, in order to complete the grain procurement task, in addition to carrying out political work, we must also especially strengthen economic work in rural areas. This means strictly managing the market, implementing price policies, strengthening the supply of materials to rural areas, actively organizing rural savings, and doing a good job in recovering agricultural loans. If these tasks are not done well, even if the political work is done well, the farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain and their production initiative will still be affected, the farmers' scattered funds will easily be spent recklessly, and some farmers may even still take the capitalist road of commercial speculation and usury. This is detrimental to both the country and the farmers.

In the past, in some places, due to lax market management, speculative merchants took the opportunity to disrupt prices and used fraudulent methods to buy grain, causing some farmers to be reluctant to sell and hoard grain; even if some was sold, it fell into the hands of speculative grain merchants, becoming their tool for exploiting urban and rural people. For example, Xuzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province produces more than half of the province's total soybean production, and this year the state has posted prices for purchase that are higher than last year. However, due to the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants, the state's purchasing plan has been disrupted, resulting in insufficient oil supply in some areas of Jiangsu Province, adding many difficulties to people's lives. This shows that if we do not strengthen management and eliminate the criminal activities of speculative merchants, even if agricultural products are abundant and state prices are reasonable, purchasing and sales work will still be disrupted, and urban and rural people will still suffer great losses. Recently, some places have taken resolute measures to strengthen market management, arrest grain speculators with serious crimes, and severely punish them according to law, which is completely correct and necessary. Protecting the interests of the state and the people is the duty of the People's Government. The People's Government has always kept its word, and any lawbreakers who dare to violate state laws and continue to抢购 (qiǎnggòu, panic buying),囤积 (túnjī, hoarding), and倒卖 (dǎomài, reselling) grain must be severely punished.

After strengthening market management, it is also necessary to implement fair and reasonable prices in order to do a good job in grain procurement. Because the grain market is currently more active and the time of listing is more concentrated, this further increases the importance of implementing price policies. The state's grain procurement prices are uniformly stipulated in various places, and they are fair, benefiting both the country and the farmers. But this does not mean that problems will not occur in the implementation of this price policy. On the contrary, various places need to pay attention to many issues when implementing this price policy, the most important of which is to earnestly implement the principle of "superior grade, superior price, and grading price" during grain procurement. Because grain grades vary from place to place, and the identification of various grades is mastered by the grain purchasing comrades in various places, it is not easy to do this work well. However, the quality of this work directly affects the interests of the state and the farmers. If the grades are improperly determined, too high, the state will suffer; if they are too low, forming price suppression, the farmers will suffer, which will reduce their enthusiasm for selling grain and affect their initiative to increase grain production. Therefore, formulating the state's grain prices is indeed an important task, and implementing grain prices is also a very important task, not just a small technical issue. Grain purchasing units and all comrades engaged in grain purchasing work must attach importance to this work and earnestly implement the price policy for grain procurement.

Buying grain from farmers is only half of the task completed, or even only a small part. After farmers sell grain and receive money, they need to exchange it for the means of production and means of livelihood they need, especially the means of production. This is a legitimate demand of the farmers, and we must meet these requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the supply of materials in rural areas, especially to do a good job in the supply of means of production, and encourage and guide farmers to invest the money earned from selling grain in expanding reproduction. In recent years, due to the development of the rural economy, the farmers' draught animals, farm implements, and fertilizers have all increased, but compared with the requirements of today's agricultural economy, the means of production in rural areas are still insufficient. According to a key survey in Baoji Prefecture after this year's autumn harvest, the 1,824 mu of land in Xiamiao Village, Siqu, Mei County, only had 34 head of livestock. According to the actual situation in the area, one head of livestock can only cultivate more than 20 mu of land, with a shortage of 57 head of livestock. Dangxi Village in the township has 1,347 mu of land with only 27 head of livestock, a shortage of 40 head. The Song Wanxuan mutual aid group in the township has seven members and cultivates 93 mu of land, but has no livestock at all. In addition to the four plows and five seed drills added in the first half of this year, Sixi Township, Bin County, also plans to add 24 head of livestock after the autumn harvest; 51 households in Sanqu, Xingping County, will buy horses after the autumn, 15 households will buy carts, 15 households will buy cattle, and 30 households will buy土车 (tǔchē, local-made carts). This shows that the vast number of farmers have an urgent need for means of production. The mutual aid group in Ponan Village, Maying District, Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, has already sold most of its surplus grain after the autumn harvest, but still has 3,400 jin of surplus grain. The members of the group said: "This grain will not be sold easily if we do not buy livestock!" This also shows that doing a good job in the supply of means of production is an important measure to promote farmers' enthusiastic sale of surplus grain and also an important measure to encourage farmers' initiative to increase grain production.

Some farmers, after selling their surplus grain, in addition to exchanging it for the necessary means of production and means of livelihood, also have a portion of money that is not needed temporarily. We must educate these farmers to use this money correctly. This means encouraging them to save, develop credit cooperatives, and repay agricultural loans. People's Banks at all levels should adhere to the policy of persuasion and education, adhere to the principle of farmers' voluntariness, and explain to farmers the benefits of saving for accumulating investment power for next year's production, in order to stimulate their initiative to save voluntarily. This year, the State Bank has specially stipulated that generous interest rates will be given for savings during the grain purchase period to welcome farmers' savings. The state also exempted interest income tax on grain sales savings and stipulated that payments would be made in installments during spring plowing investment. If a farmer deposits 500,000 yuan, he can get an interest of 45,000 yuan after six months. This money can buy more than a zhang of worker-peasant blue cloth or more than 60 jin of soybean cake. Therefore, educating farmers to save the money they do not need temporarily can prevent them from spending it casually, avoid everyone抢购 (qiǎnggòu, rush-buying) things, causing prices to rise, and also enable them to take out sufficient funds when needed to add farm tools, replace good farm tools, apply more fertilizer, and expand investment in agricultural production. As for organizing farmers' idle funds and developing credit mutual aid cooperative organizations, it is an important method that facilitates farmers to mutually adjust when they encounter needs in production and life, and is conducive to fighting against usury. For farmers who have the ability to repay agricultural loans that are due, People's Banks at all levels should also strengthen their education, explaining that repaying agricultural loans on time according to their actual repayment ability will enable the state to have more funds to continue supporting agricultural production and solving major difficulties in farmers' lives. The figures for government agricultural loans in previous years have been increasing year by year. For example, with the actual number of loans in 1950 as 100, 1951 was 170.6 percent, 1952 was 515.38 percent, and the first half of 1953 was 459.92 percent, and the cumulative figure for the first half of 1953 reached more than 950 billion yuan. This shows that repaying agricultural loans on time is not only the responsibility of farmers, but also benefits all farmers. However, it is absolutely forbidden to emphasize the turnover of bank funds one-sidedly and take coercive measures without considering the situation.

Doing the above work well can encourage farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain and farmers' initiative in production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance in an important aspect. All personnel involved in rural economic work should deeply recognize that their work has great political and economic significance and is an important task during my country's economic construction period, and should not regard their daily work as just ordinary commercial transactions or simple bank deposit and loan work. Stalin said: "Soviet commerce is our own Bolshevik cause, and commercial workers, including salespeople, as long as they work sincerely, are the executors of our revolutionary Bolshevik cause." (Summary Report on the Work of the CPSU (B) Central Committee at the 17th Party Congress) Therefore, whether it is a staff member of the trade, cooperation, or bank department, they should work with the greatest enthusiasm to actively complete the tasks entrusted by the people.

In order to do a good job in grain procurement and economic work in grain procurement, party committees at all levels, especially county and district party committees, should immediately take necessary measures to strengthen unified leadership in economic work in grain procurement. In areas where this work has not yet been strengthened, the party committee should quickly take charge of it and arrange and deploy the work of the relevant economic departments in a unified manner, so that they can closely cooperate, support each other, establish an overall concept, overcome decentralism, and do their best to do a good job in grain procurement and economic work in grain procurement.

Our economic policy is correct and in line with the vital interests of the vast number of people. Our party committees and governments at all levels have strong leadership, coupled with the work enthusiasm of economic workers and the increasing awareness of the vast number of farmers. Therefore, we will definitely be able to do a good job in grain procurement and economic work in grain procurement.

### 加强粮食收购中的经济工作

    加强粮食收购中的经济工作
    最近各地在开始大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线以后，很多农民踊跃地把余粮卖给国家，有的农民过去误信奸商，受了欺骗，现在也觉悟了。如湖北省谷城县火神庙乡农民刘长富，从前误信奸商的谣言，存着粮食打算等着高价出售。听了购粮组的宣传后，他说：“我决不能背了亲人去亲仇人，忘了国家去亲奸商。我刘长富过去几十年肚子里装的是菜草，有了共产党、毛主席、人民政府的领导，才吃的是粮食。再过几年，日子还会更好。”他立即把余粮七百多斤卖给了收购组。这说明只要向农民讲清楚总路线，打开农民的眼界，澄清部分农民的糊涂思想，使农民看清国家和自己的光明灿烂的前途，他们就能够欢欣鼓舞地积极支援国家的经济建设。
    但是为了完成购粮任务，除了进行政治工作以外，还必须特别加强农村的经济工作。这就是严格管理市场，贯彻价格政策，加强农村的物资供应，积极组织农村储蓄并做好收回农业贷款的工作。如果不做好这些工作，那么虽然政治工作作好了，农民的卖粮情绪和生产积极性就还是会受影响，农民中的零星资金就容易胡乱花掉，有些农民甚至会仍然走向商业投机和放高利贷的资本主义道路。这既不利于国家也不利于农民。
    过去，有些地方由于市场管理不严格，投机奸商就乘机扰乱物价，并用欺诈的办法套购粮食，引起某些农民的惜售思想，囤粮不卖；即使卖出一些，也落到投机粮商手中，成为他们剥削城乡人民的工具。例如江苏省徐州专区，出产的黄豆占全省总产量一半以上，今年国家又以比去年高的价钱挂牌收购。但是，由于奸商的抢购囤积，破坏了国家的收购计划，造成了江苏省部分地区的食油供应不足，给人民生活增加很多困难。由此可见，如果不加强管理，不消灭投机奸商的罪恶活动，即使农产丰富、国家价格合理，购销工作仍会遭到破坏，城乡人民仍然会吃大亏。最近有些地方采取了坚决的措施，加强市场管理，逮捕罪行严重的粮食投机奸商，依法严惩，这是完全正确和必要的。保护国家和人民的利益，是人民政府的职责。人民政府向来是说到做到的，任何不法分子如果敢于破坏国家法令，继续抢购、囤积和倒卖粮食，一定要给予严厉的制裁。
    加强了市场管理之后，还必须贯彻公平合理的价格，这才能作好收购粮食的工作。由于目前粮食上市比较踊跃，上市的时间又较集中，这就更增加了贯彻价格政策的重要性。国家收购粮食的价格在各地都有统一的规定，它是公平的，既利于国家又利于农民。但这并不等于在执行这个价格政策时就不会发生问题了。相反，各地在执行这个价格政策时，还需要注意很多问题，最主要的就是在购粮时要认真实现“优级优价、分等论价”的原则。因为粮食等级各地不一，各种等级的辨别，又是由各地购粮工作同志所掌握，要作好这项工作是很不容易的。但这项工作的好坏却直接影响国家和农民的利益。如果等级订的不当，订的过高了，国家就会吃亏；订的过低了，形成压级压价，农民就会吃亏，也就会降低他们卖粮的情绪，影响他们增产粮食的积极性。所以，制定国家的粮食价格，固然是一项重要的工作，就是贯彻粮食价格，也是一项十分重要的任务，决不只是细小的技术问题。粮食收购单位和一切购粮工作的同志，都必须重视这个工作，认真贯彻收购粮食的价格政策。
    从农民手中买到了粮食，还只是完成了任务的
  一半，甚至只是一小半。农民卖粮后得到货币，就需要换回所需的生产资料和生活资料，特别是生产资料。这是农民的正当要求，我们务必满足他们的这些要求。因此就必须加强农村中的物资供应工作，特别是要做好生产资料的供应工作，鼓励和引导农民将卖粮所得的款项，投资于扩大再生产。几年来，由于农村经济的发展，农民的耕畜、农具、肥料都有增加，但是和今天农业经济的要求相比较，农村生产资料还是不够的。据今年秋收后宝鸡专区的重点调查，郿县四区三乡下庙村一、八二四亩地，只有三十四头牲口，以当地实际情况推算，一头牲口只能耕种二十余亩地，尚缺牲口五十七头。该乡党西村有一、三四七亩地。只有二十七头牲口，尚缺四十头牲口。该乡宋万轩互助组，七户组员，种九十三亩地，一头牲口也没有。邠县四区四乡今年上半年除已添了四个犁、五个耧外，还计划在秋收后添二十四头牲口；兴平县三区有五十一户在秋后要买马、十五户要买大车、十五户要买牛、三十户要买土车。由此可以看到，广大农民对生产资料的要求是很迫切的。陕西省宝鸡县马营区坡南村互助组，今年秋收后除已卖出了大部余粮，还有三千四百斤余粮，该组组员说：“这些粮，不买牲口是不轻易出卖的！”这也说明：做好生产资料的供应工作，是促使农民踊跃卖出余粮的重要措施，也是鼓励农民增产粮食的积极性的重要措施。
    有些农民出卖余粮后，除换回必需的生产资料和生活资料外，还有一部分暂时不需用的钱。我们必须教育这些农民，把这些钱作正确的使用。这就是要鼓励他们节约储蓄、发展信用合作、归还农业贷款等。各级人民银行应坚持说服教育的方针，坚持农民自愿的原则，向农民说明节约储蓄对积蓄明年生产投资力量的好处，以启发农民自愿储蓄的积极性。今年国家银行为欢迎农民储蓄，特地规定对于购粮期间的储蓄给予优厚的利息。国家还豁免了售粮储蓄的利息所得税，并规定在春耕投资时陆续付款。如果农民存入五十万元，六个月后可得利息四万五千元，这笔钱可买一丈多的工农蓝布，可买六十几斤豆饼。所以，教育农民把暂时不用的钱节约储蓄，既可防止随便花掉，又可避免大家抢购东西，造成物价上涨，并且还可以在需用时拿出足够的资金来添置农具，换好农具，多施肥料，扩大对农业生产的投资。至于组织农民闲散资金，发展信用互助合作组织，是便于农民在生产和生活上遇到需要时可互相调剂，而有利于和高利贷进行斗争的重要办法。对到期而有力偿还农贷的农民，各级人民银行也应对他们加强教育，说明根据实际偿还能力按期归还农贷，国家才可能有更多的资金继续扶植农业生产和解决农民生活上的重大困难。政府历年的农业贷款的数字是逐年增加的。如以一九五○年的贷款实数为一○○，一九五一年为百分之一七○·六，一九五二年为百分之五一五·三八，一九五三年上半年为百分之四五九·九二，而一九五三年上半年的累积数字即达九万五千多亿元。这说明：到期归还农贷，不仅是农民应有的责任，也是对全体农民有好处的。但也决不能不问情况，片面地强调银行资金周转而采取强索的办法。
    做好以上这些工作，就可以鼓舞农民卖粮的热情和农民的生产积极性，并在一个重要方面巩固工农联盟。所有有关农村经济的工作人员，都应该深切地认识自己的工作具有重大的政治意义和经济意义，是我国经济建设时期的一个重要工作，而不应该把自己的日常工作认为只是普通的商业买卖或单纯的银行存放款工作。斯大林说：“苏维埃商业乃是我们切身的布尔什维克的事业，而商业工作人员，包括售货员在内，只要他们诚恳工作，就是我们革命布尔什维克事业底执行者。”（在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）所以，不论是贸易、合作和银行任何一个部门的工作人员，都应该以最大热情，为积极完成人民所委托的任务而努力。
    为做好购粮工作和购粮中的经济工作，各级党委尤其是县、区党委应立即采取必要的措施，加强购粮中经济工作的统一领导，还没有加强领导这项工作的地区，党委应迅速地把它管起来，将有关各经济部门的工作进行统一安排和布置，使其密切配合，互相支持，树立整体观念，克服分散主义，全力做好购粮工作和购粮中的经济工作。
    我们的经济政策是正确的，是符合广大人民切身利益的，我们各级党委和政府又有坚强的领导，加上经济工作人员的工作积极性和广大农民日益提高的觉悟，因此，我们一定能够把购粮工作和购粮中的经济工作做好。
