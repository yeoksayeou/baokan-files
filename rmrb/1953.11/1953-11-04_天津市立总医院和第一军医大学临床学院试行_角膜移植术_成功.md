    Tianjin Municipal General Hospital and the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University Successfully Trialed "Corneal Transplantation"

    Following the successful trials of "corneal transplantation" by medical workers in Xi'an, Shenyang and other places, ophthalmologists at Tianjin Municipal General Hospital and the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have also successfully adopted the "corneal transplantation" technique, restoring sight to seven blind patients.

    Ophthalmologists at Tianjin Municipal General Hospital and the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began studying this advanced medical experience of Soviet Academician Filatov this spring. After three months of research, they conducted multiple successful experiments on rabbits. In September, they began directly performing "corneal transplantation" on patients. As of October 20th, Tianjin Municipal General Hospital had performed "corneal transplantation" on seven patients. Among them, except for one patient whose corneal sutures failed due to other eye conditions and requires further "corneal transplantation" later, the other six were successful. The Clinical College of the First Military Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also performed "corneal transplantation" on three patients, of which the one who underwent surgery earlier has regained sight. The other two, due to the short time since the operation, it is not yet possible to see the results. These patients cured by "corneal transplantation" have all made progress in their vision. Currently, Tianjin Municipal General Hospital has established a registration system for "corneal transplantation," pre-registering patients who require this surgery so that they can be treated in a timely manner when materials are available.

    天津市立总医院和第一军医大学临床学院试行“角膜移植术”成功
    继西安、沈阳等地医务工作者试行“角膜移植术”获得成功之后，天津市立总医院和中国人民解放军第一军医大学临床学院的眼科医生也成功地采用了“角膜移植术”，使七个失明的病人恢复了光明。
    天津市立总医院和中国人民解放军第一军医大学临床学院的眼科医生，是在今年春天开始学习苏联费拉托夫院士这一先进医学经验的。经过三个月的研究后，他们分别在家兔身上做了多次试验，都得到成功。今年九月份，开始直接给病人施行“角膜移植术”。到十月二十日以前，天津市立总医院已为七个病人做了“角膜移植术”，其中除一人因有其他眼病角膜缝线失败、需待以后再继续施行“角膜移植术”外，其他六人都试行成功；中国人民解放军第一军医大学临床学院也为三个病人施行了“角膜移植术”，其中施行手术较早的一人，眼睛已复明，另外两人因时间较短，目前还看不出效果来。这些经过“角膜移植术”治愈的病人，在视力上都有了进步。现在，天津市立总医院已建立起“角膜移植术”的登记制度，把要求施行这项手术的病人预先登记好，以便有了材料及时进行医治。
