Hebei Province Party Organizations at All Levels Begin to Strengthen Political and Ideological Leadership over Secondary Schools
Zhu Ziqiang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the past four years, secondary school education in Hebei Province has greatly developed. In 1949, there were 177 secondary schools in the province, with 42,908 students and 2,275 faculty and staff. By the first half of 1953, this had grown to 370 schools, with 131,851 students and 9,799 faculty and staff. Secondary schools in Hebei Province have gradually implemented the policy of opening their doors to the children of workers and peasants and serving national construction. At the same time, during the process of recovery and development, preliminary rectification and reform work has been carried out. In particular, during the summer vacation of 1952, about 7,000 faculty and staff from secondary schools across the province were concentrated for ideological remolding study movements. After this study, the majority of teachers and school cadres basically clarified the lines between the enemy and ourselves in terms of politics, ideology, and organization, laying a favorable foundation for systematically conducting Marxist-Leninist education, learning from advanced Soviet experience, and further implementing teaching reforms. However, in the work of secondary school education in Hebei Province, there are still many serious problems. Many schools lack leading backbone personnel, and the political and professional levels of many school leaders are not yet up to the needs. The teaching quality in some secondary schools is very low. After the ideological remolding study, many teachers urgently requested to study Marxism-Leninism, but the leadership did not keep up with providing guidance. Many schools did not concentrate their leadership strength on teaching work. Serious chaotic phenomena that violated educational policies, educational principles, and laws and disciplines existed in many secondary schools for a long time. Party organizations at all levels have very weak political and ideological leadership over secondary schools, and have not taken effective measures to solve various urgent tasks and serious problems in school work in a timely manner. The political and ideological education of party member cadres and the work of building the party and the Communist Youth League also have serious spontaneous tendencies. This situation urgently requires party organizations at all levels to further strengthen political and ideological leadership over secondary schools.

In order to solve these problems, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Political and Ideological Leadership in Secondary Schools" on January 28 this year. The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee convened a meeting of the heads of the cultural and education sections of the local Party committees and municipal Party committees in March to examine the leadership of the local Party committees and municipal Party committees over school work, implemented the spirit of the political work conference for secondary schools of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and determined that the focus of efforts in the first half of the year should be to overcome the chaotic phenomena in school education. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, in the past six months, party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province have mainly taken the following measures to strengthen political and ideological leadership in secondary schools:

(1) The propaganda departments of the provincial, regional, and municipal Party committees first established organizational structures specifically for managing cultural and educational work. According to statistics, as of the end of June, the propaganda departments of the provincial, regional, and municipal Party committees had 58 full-time cultural and educational cadres. Some county and township Party committee propaganda departments also set up part-time staff to manage cultural and educational work. After the establishment of the institutions responsible for cultural and educational work in the propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, a system of regular management of school work was established. Key inspections of secondary school work were carried out to grasp basic situations and determine specific methods for strengthening leadership, unifying steps, and overcoming chaotic phenomena, and began to conduct more systematic and specific leadership of school work.

(2) Deploying and promoting cadres to strengthen the leadership backbone of secondary schools. In the past four years, secondary schools in Hebei Province have experienced substantial development, followed by a shortage of leadership cadres in schools. According to statistics in January this year, the province was short 139 principals and vice-principals, 115 teaching affairs directors, 108 general affairs directors, and 116 political instructors, which prevented the central government's educational policies from being effectively implemented. To address this, the Provincial Committee decided this spring to transfer 250 county-level and district-level party member cadres with firm political beliefs and at least junior high school education from various party organizations, government departments, and mass organizations to work in secondary schools. The first batch of 200 people was transferred and concentrated in the province in mid-May. The remaining 50 people in the second batch are planned to be transferred by the end of the year. To enable these cadres to initially grasp educational guidelines and policies and understand the general situation of secondary school work, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Education Department specifically conducted a short-term training for them. Then, they were assigned with focus based on the vacancies in various schools. On the other hand, various localities also planned to promote a group of cadres and teachers with political progress and professional expertise from various secondary schools to strengthen the school leadership structure.

In order to strengthen political education and improve the quality of political classes, various localities also adjusted and supplemented 143 political instructors for secondary schools. The Provincial Party School and the Education Department also held a training class for political instructors. The training class systematically imparted the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism based on the actual needs of teaching, and through summarizing past work methods, discussed and studied how to strengthen political and ideological work in schools and improve the quality of political class teaching. While training these cadres, various localities adopted the method of inviting local party and government leaders or school leaders to give lectures or large classes (two classes combined for political class) to solve the temporary shortage of political classes.

(3) Focusing efforts on inspecting and overcoming chaotic phenomena in secondary schools, improving teaching effectiveness, and changing leadership styles has been the focus of our work to strengthen schools in the past six months. Because secondary schools in our province have developed rapidly, and party and administrative leading organs have not had time to tightly grasp leadership over school work in the past, serious chaotic phenomena exist in many schools, hindering the normal progress of teaching work. In the past, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government had repeatedly instructed to overcome chaotic phenomena in schools, but due to a lack of specific measures, these instructions were not implemented in many places. In order to effectively change this situation, in addition to convening school work meetings by party organizations and administrative leading organs at all levels this year, the following specific measures were also taken:

First, organize forces for key inspections. The Hebei Provincial People's Government Education Department, in coordination with the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Education Trade Union, inspected 18 secondary schools. The propaganda departments of the local Party committees and municipal Party committees also worked with relevant government departments to conduct key inspections in three to five secondary schools. During the inspection, we learned about the situation, studied methods for overcoming chaotic phenomena, and helped schools formulate measures and establish systems. Through inspection, the chaotic phenomena in schools were basically curbed. During the inspection, we gradually realized that the tasks of party, administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and student union organizations in schools should all focus on ensuring the completion of teaching work, and thus initially unified work steps. Most schools have unified the activity time of various organizations and established a regular joint meeting or coordination meeting system for the party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League.

Second, educate cadres to implement policies by handling typical events. The discipline inspection commissions of party committees at all levels conducted serious handling of the illegal and disciplinary events of cadres in a few secondary schools, and continuously exposed and criticized typical events in newspapers. The Hebei Daily continuously exposed and criticized the illegal and disciplinary events of the principal of Fengfeng Coal Mine Industrial School, and announced the punishments given by the party and the people's government. This aroused the vigilance of party and administrative leading organs at all levels and school leaders. All secondary schools checked their own work by studying the events and comments exposed in the newspapers. After the exposure and criticism, some better schools were praised in the newspapers, and specific methods and experiences in overcoming chaotic phenomena were introduced.

Third, while dealing with illegal and disciplinary problems, focus on inspecting and correcting various erroneous deviations that violate educational policies and educational principles in secondary schools. Because party organizations at all levels lacked political and ideological leadership over school work in the past, phenomena that violated educational principles and educational policies were relatively common in secondary schools. Some schools did not understand that learning is a long-term, step-by-step process of mastering various knowledge, and mistakenly organized learning shock competitions – launching "Learning Month" and "Good Student Movement," and inappropriately proposed slogans such as "Eliminate failing grades" and "Eliminate C grades in the whole class." Some schools did not conduct patient persuasion and education on students' shortcomings and mistakes, but instead took crude methods such as "holding struggle sessions" and engaging in "spiritual blockade" to solve them, or used rectification methods to ask students to examine and reflect, and even occurred barbaric physical punishment, insults, and scolding of students. The Hebei Provincial Committee continuously used methods such as circular criticism and key inspections to correct and criticize this erroneous tendency. Party organizations at all levels have also paid attention to these issues.

(4) Most secondary schools have initially established regular political and ideological work. Most secondary schools have designated a communist party member from the teaching affairs director or deputy director to specifically manage political and ideological work. Local party organizations have begun to strengthen the leadership of the political theory study of secondary school teachers and staff. Teachers and staff in various schools have begun to study the history of the Chinese Communist Party, and have achieved certain results. Teachers participating in the study have initially realized the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Communist Party. Some teachers have also voluntarily reviewed their past erroneous thoughts of opposing the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Some teachers actively requested to join the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League. Some teachers criticized their views of belittling the children of workers and peasants. Political and ideological work in schools has gradually strengthened, and the focus of leadership has turned to teaching. Many teachers are working hard to learn from advanced Soviet teaching experiences and are starting to improve teaching work. Some schools and teachers have begun to establish a comprehensive responsible thought in teaching, and have strengthened political and ideological education for students through various subject teaching and supplementary extracurricular activities. The political work of party organizations in schools has also gradually strengthened. Party and Communist Youth League organizations have planned to organize students to visit factories and farms, have gatherings with model workers, communicate with volunteers, listen to the radio, read newspapers, and organize some forums introducing excellent Soviet literary works. These activities have promoted students' learning and gradually improved their academic performance. In the past year, especially in the past six months, party organizations in schools have also developed. 3,754 party members have been developed among secondary school students across the province, and 759 party members have been developed among teachers and staff, enhancing the party's leading role in school work.

In the past six months, thanks to the efforts of party and administrative leading organs at all levels, education work cadres at all levels, and the vast number of teachers, the work of secondary schools across the province has been significantly improved. External chaotic phenomena (especially excessive participation in social activities and multi-headed leadership) have been basically overcome. The situation of many organizations, many concurrent jobs, and many meetings within schools has also begun to be corrected. The erroneous practice of launching learning competitions and struggling against students has been criticized. This has laid the foundation for improving teaching and raising teaching quality.

However, many problems still exist in secondary schools. According to the inspection situation in the first half of the year, the "five excesses" phenomenon within secondary schools is still serious, mainly manifested in: (A) Many organizations. In addition to organizations such as the party, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and student union in general schools, there are also various overlapping committees and organizations such as drama troupes, waist drum teams, and cooperatives, about 30 types, which is one of the main reasons for internal busyness in schools. (B) Many concurrent jobs. Some teachers in some schools have as many as 12 concurrent jobs, and students have as many as four jobs. (C) Many tasks. Some schools inappropriately assign many administrative tasks to teachers and students. Some schools in Tongxian Prefecture stipulate that students take turns on night shifts to "protect the school." (D) Many meetings. Some schools have almost daily meetings. According to statistics from Shijiazhuang No. 2 Middle School in March, there were 29 types of meetings in the whole month, a total of 250 meetings, which took 294 hours, seriously affecting teaching activities. (E) Many assignments. Some schools give students too much homework without following the teaching syllabus and the actual situation of the students, and the teachers of various subjects lack cooperation and unified control, leaving homework sometimes lightly and sometimes heavily, even making students unable to rest, affecting students' physical health and learning. The phenomenon of violating educational policies in school work has not been completely eliminated. While overcoming chaotic phenomena in schools, some schools have produced a laissez-faire deviation. For example, they dare not deal with a few students who do not abide by school rules and disrupt discipline. The party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals has not been sufficiently implemented in secondary schools. The idea that school leaders rely on teachers to run schools well is not clear. Two deviations, demanding too much of teachers too quickly or laissez-faire, coexist. Therefore, many schools only pay attention to student work, relax ideological leadership over teachers, and do not unite, help, and care for teachers politically well. Some school leaders do not have enough understanding of the unity of strengthening political and ideological work and doing a good job in teaching work, and oppose political and ideological work to teaching work. The party organization's specific political and ideological leadership over teachers' political theory study is also insufficient. In addition, how the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels strengthen the regular leadership of school work, and how the party branches in secondary schools guarantee the progress of teaching work from various aspects are still lacking systematic experience. These problems must be solved gradually and systematically. Therefore, in the second half of the year, we plan to focus on the following aspects of work:

(1) Overcome the busy chaos in schools, establish and improve the internal work system of schools, and properly solve the "five excesses" problem in schools. To this end, the Hebei Provincial Committee has formulated the "Regulations on Simplifying Various Organizations in Primary and Secondary Schools and Various Activities of Teachers and Students" so that party organizations and school cadres at all levels have specific principles to follow when dealing with problems.

(2) Strengthen the leadership of the political theory study of secondary school teachers, overcome the deviations of heavy weight, many tasks, and high requirements in teachers' learning, emphasize inspiring teachers to study consciously and willingly, and take into account the characteristics of school education work, maintain regularity and persistence, and enable teachers to learn easily and happily. The party history study of secondary school teachers will be changed from planned completion in one year to about one and a half years, and the number of study hours per week will be appropriately reduced. Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and other cities, those with conditions can gradually establish teachers' spare-time political theory schools, and in rural areas, improve the method of teaching teachers' learning by the propaganda departments of local party committees to strengthen ideological guidance. Secondly, party organizations and leading cadres in schools must clearly establish the idea of relying on teachers to run schools well, and closely link the leadership with teachers. It is necessary to check, criticize, and correct the erroneous thoughts and behaviors of some school leaders who look down on teachers, do not approach teachers, and are detached from teachers, and resolutely implement the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals.

(3) Further overcome the phenomenon of violating educational policies and educational principles in school work, and at the same time strengthen the regular political and ideological education of students, inspire students' learning enthusiasm, consolidate learning discipline, and gradually improve teaching effectiveness. In addition, various measures must be taken to improve students' health.

(4) Strengthen the work of party branches in secondary schools. Party organizations in schools should closely integrate political and ideological work with teaching work to ensure the completion of the school's education plan and improve teaching and learning effectiveness. Therefore, all kinds of party work should revolve around and serve teaching work. In the past, some branches only took care of party affairs work, did not care about the implementation of the teaching work plan, or took over administrative affairs, relaxed party work, and other deviations should be corrected in a timely manner.

(5) The propaganda departments of party committees at all levels should further strengthen the political and ideological leadership of secondary schools. First, they should cooperate with education administrative departments at all levels to continue to conduct a thorough investigation of secondary schools in various places in a planned manner, so as to divide them into types and propose specific measures to improve work separately. For schools with relatively sound political work, teaching work, and various organizations, we should strengthen leadership, summarize and promote their experiences, and focus on improving teaching work. For schools with political work and teaching systems that are not very sound and still have chaotic phenomena, we should first overcome chaotic phenomena and establish and improve regular teaching work and political work systems. For schools that still have some serious problems, we must organize forces to conduct key inspections and solve problems in a timely manner. In order to further strengthen school political work, party organizations at all levels should conscientiously implement the system of regularly inspecting schools in their jurisdictions in order to deeply understand the situation, solve problems in a timely manner, and improve work.

    河北省各级党组织开始加强对中等学校的政治思想领导
    中共河北省委宣传部副部长　朱子强
    四年来河北省的中等学校教育有了很大的发展。一九四九年全省有中等学校一百七十七所，学生四万二千九百零八人，教职员二千二百七十五人，到一九五三年上半年已发展到三百七十所学校，学生十三万一千八百五十一人，教职员九千七百九十九人。河北省的中等学校逐步贯彻了向工农子女开门和为国家建设服务的方针，同时，在恢复和发展的过程中，初步进行了整顿和改革工作。特别是一九五二年暑假，全省中等学校约七千教职员集中进行了思想改造学习运动。经过这次学习，大部教师和学校干部在政治上、思想上、组织上基本上划清了敌我界限，为系统地进行马克思列宁主义教育和学习苏联先进经验，进一步实行教学改革工作，打下了有利的基础。但在河北省的中等学校教育工作中，是存在着许多严重问题的。许多学校缺乏领导骨干，不少学校领导干部的政治与业务水平还赶不上需要，部分中等学校的教学质量很低。在思想改造学习后，许多教师迫切要求学习马克思列宁主义，但是，领导方面并没有紧跟上去进行领导；许多学校没有把领导力量集中于教学工作；许多中等学校中长期存在着违犯教育政策教育原则和违法乱纪的严重混乱现象；各级党组织对中等学校的政治思想领导非常薄弱，对学校工作中各项迫切任务和严重问题，没有采取有效办法及时解决，党员干部的政治思想教育和建党建团工作也存在着严重的自流现象。这种情况，迫切要求各级党组织进一步加强对中等学校的政治思想领导。
    为了解决这些问题，中共河北省委曾在今年一月二十八日发布了“关于加强中等学校政治思想领导的指示”。河北省委宣传部于三月间召开了各地委、市委宣传部文教科长会议，检查了各地委、市委宣传部对学校工作领导的情况，贯彻了中共中央华北局宣传部中等学校政治工作会议的精神，确定上半年集中力量克服学校教育中的混乱现象。根据省委指示，半年来河北省各级党组织在加强中等学校政治思想领导方面，主要采取了以下几个方面的措施：
      （一）省委、地委和市委的宣传部首先建立了专管文化教育工作的组织机构。据统计，截至六月底，省委、地委、市委宣传部已有专职文教干部五十八人。部分县和镇委宣传部也设立了兼职管理文教工作的干事。各级党委宣传部专管文教工作的机构建立后，在各级党委领导下，建立了经常管理学校工作的制度，并有重点地检查了中等学校工作，掌握了基本情况，确定了加强领导、统一步调、克服混乱现象的具体办法，开始对学校工作进行比较系统的具体领导。
      （二）调配和提拔干部，充实中等学校的领导骨干。四年来河北省中等学校有大量的发展，随之而来的是学校缺乏领导干部。据今年一月份统计：全省缺正副校长一百三十九人，教导主任一百一十五人，总务主任一百零八人，政治教员一百一十六人，因而使中央的教育方针不能很好地贯彻。为此，省委于今春决定从各级党组织，政府和群众团体等部门中抽调二百五十名政治坚强而又有初中以上文化程度的县委级与区委级党员干部转入中等学校工作。第一批抽调了二百人，于五月中旬集中到省。第二批的五十人，计划年底前调齐。为使这些干部初步掌握教育方针、政策，了解中等学校工作的一般情况，河北省人民政府教育厅专门对他们进行了一次短期训练。然后根据各校缺额情况进行了重点配备。另一方面，各地还有计划地从各中等学校中提拔了一批政治进步，业务熟悉的干部和教师，充实学校领导机构。
    为了加强政治教育和提高政治课教学质量，各地还为中等学校调整与补充了政治教员一百四十三人。省委党校及教育厅并举办了一次政治教员训练班。训练班根据教学实际需要，使之比较系统地获得马克思列宁主义的基本知识，并通过总结过去工作的办法，讨论研究如何加强学校政治思想工作与改进政治课教学的质量，在训练这批干部的同时，各地采取了聘请当地党政负责同志或学校领导干部兼课或上大课（两班合并上政治课）的办法，解决了政治课的暂时缺课问题。
    （三）集中力量检查和克服中等学校的混乱现象，提高教学效果，改变领导作风，这是半年来我们加强学校工作的重点。由于我省中等学校发展很快，加以过去党和行政领导机关没有来得及对学校工作抓紧领导，因而在许多学校中存在着严重的混乱现象，妨碍教学工作的正常进行。过去省委、省府曾反复指示克服学校混乱现象，但因缺乏具体措施，因而这些指示在许多地方都没有贯彻。为了切实改变这种情况，今年上半年除各级党组织和行政领导机关召开学校工作会议外，还采取了以下的具体措施：
    一、组织力量重点检查。河北省人民政府教育厅配合青年团省委、省教育工会检查了十八所中等学校；各地委、市委宣传部也都协同政府有关部门，深入三至五所中等学校进行了重点检查。在检查中，一面了解情况，一面研究克服混乱现象的办法，帮助学校拟定措施，建立制度。经过检查，基本上制止了学校的混乱现象。在检查中，并逐步认识到学校中党、行政、工会、青年团、学生会等组织的任务都应该以保证完成教学工作为主，因而，初步统一了工作步调。多数学校已统一了各组织的活动时间，建立了党、行政、工会、青年团定期的联席会议或碰头会议制度。
    二、通过处理典型事件，教育干部贯彻政策。对少数中等学校干部的违法乱纪事件，由各级党委纪律检查委员会进行了认真的处理；并将其中的典型事件在报纸上连续地进行了揭发批判。河北日报连续揭发批判了峰峰煤矿工业学校校长违法乱纪事件，并公布了党和人民政府给予的处分。这就引起了各级党和行政领导机关以及学校领导干部的警惕。各中等学校都通过学习报纸上揭发的事件和评论，检查了自己的工作。在揭发批判之后，接着又在报纸上表扬了一些较好的学校，介绍了一些克服混乱现象的具体办法和经验。
    三、在处理违法乱纪问题的同时，着重检查与纠正了中等学校中各种违犯教育政策、教育原则的错误偏向。由于各级党组织过去对学校工作缺乏政治思想领导，违犯教育原则和教育政策的现象，在中等学校中是较为普遍的。有些学校不了解学习是一个长期的循序渐进的掌握各种知识的过程，错误地去组织学习突击竞赛——开展“学习月”和 “好学生运动”，不适当地提出“消灭不及格现象”、“消灭全班丙等分”等口号。有些学校对学生的缺点与错误，不是进行耐心的说服教育，而是采取“开斗争会”、搞“精神封锁”等粗暴方式去解决，或者用整风方式要学生检查、反省，甚至发生野蛮的体罚、侮辱、谩骂学生等现象。河北省委曾连续地用通报批评和重点检查等办法，纠正和批判了这种错误倾向。各级党组织也已经注意了这些问题。
      （四）大部分的中等学校已初步建立起经常的政治思想工作。各中等学校大都从教导主任或副主任中确定了一个共产党员专管政治思想工作。各地党组织开始加强了对中等学校教职员政治理论学习的领导。各校教职员开始学习中国共产党党史，并已获得一定的成绩。参加学习的教师初步认识到共产党的光荣、伟大和正确。其中还有些教师自动地检讨了过去与共产党和青年团闹对立的错误思想；有些教师积极地要求参加共产党或参加青年团；有些教师批判了自己轻视工农子女的观点。学校中的政治思想工作已逐步加强，领导重点已转向教学，许多教师努力学习苏联先进教学经验，着手改进教学工作，部分学校和教师在教学中开始树立起全面负责的思想，通过各科教学和辅导课外活动，加强了对学生的政治思想教育。学校中党组织的政治工作也已逐步加强。党和团的组织有计划地组织了学生参观工厂、农场，同劳动模范联欢，和志愿军通信、收听广播、读报和组织一些介绍苏联优秀文学作品的座谈会等。这些活动推动了学生的学习，使学习成绩逐步上升。一年来，特别是近半年来学校中党的组织也有了发展，在全省中等学校学生中发展党员三千七百五十四人，在教职员中发展党员七百五十九人，增强了党在学校工作中的领导作用。
    半年来，经过各级党和行政领导机关和各级教育工作干部、广大教师的努力，全省中等学校工作已有了显著的改进。来自外部的混乱现象（特别是过多的参加社会活动和多头领导），已基本上克服。学校内部组织多、兼职多、会议多的情况，也已开始注意纠正。错误地发动学习竞赛和斗争学生等错误作法，已受到批判。这就为改进教学，提高教学质量打下了基础。
    但目前中等学校中仍存在着不少的问题，根据上半年检查的情况，中等学校内部的“五多”现象还是严重的，主要表现在：（甲）组织多，一般学校除党、行政、工会、青年团、学生会等组织外，还有各种重重叠叠的委员会及剧团、腰鼓队、合作社等组织约有三十余种，这是学校内部忙乱的主要原因之一。（乙）兼职多，有的学校教师兼职多到十二种，学生多至四职。（丙）任务多，有些学校把很多行政工作不适当地交给教师学生去做。通县专区有些学校规定学生要轮流值夜班“护校”。（丁）会议多，有的学校差不多每天都有会议。据石家庄市二中三月份统计：全月大小会议二十九种，共开二百五十次，花了二百九十四小时，严重地影响了教学活动。（戊）作业多，有些学校不根据教学大纲及学生实际情况，过多地给学生留作业，加以各科教师缺乏配合和统一掌握，留作业忽轻忽重，甚至使学生不能休息，影响学生的身体健康和学习。学校工作中的违背教育政策的现象并没有完全消灭；在克服学校中的混乱现象同时，有些学校又产生了放任自流的偏向。例如对少数不守校规、破坏纪律的学生，不敢进行处理。党的团结改造知识分子的政策在中等学校中还贯彻得不够，许多学校的领导干部依靠教师办好学校的思想还不明确，对教师要求过高过急或放任自流两种偏向同时存在。因此许多学校只注意学生工作，放松了对教师思想领导，没有很好地团结、帮助和从政治上关心教师。有些学校的领导干部对加强政治思想工作与搞好教学工作的统一性认识不足，把政治思想工作与教学工作对立起来。党组织对教师政治理论学习的具体的政治思想领导也还不够。此外，各级党委宣传部如何加强对学校工作的经常领导，中等学校中党的支部如何从多方面保证教学工作的进行等，都还缺乏系统的经验。这些问题，必须有计划地逐步地予以解决。因此，下半年我们准备着重进行以下几个方面的工作：
      （一）克服校内的忙乱现象，建立和健全学校内部的工作制度，妥善解决学校内的“五多”问题。为此，河北省委已制订了“关于精简中、小学各种组织及师生各种活动若干问题的规定”，以便各级党组织及学校干部处理问题时有具体原则，可以有所遵循。
      （二）加强对中等学校教师政治理论学习的领导，克服教师学习中分量重、任务多、要求高的偏向，强调启发教师自觉自愿学习和照顾学校教育工作的特点，保持经常持久，使教师轻松愉快地进行学习。中等学校教师的党史学习由计划一年完成改为一年半左右完成，适当减少每周学习的时数。石家庄、保定等市，有条件者可逐步建立教师业余政治理论学校，在农村改善各地委宣传部对教师学习的传授办法，以加强思想指导。其次，学校党组织及领导干部，必须明确树立依靠教师办好学校的思想，密切领导与教师的联系；必须检查批判和纠正一些学校领导干部对教师看不起、不接近教师和脱离教师的错误思想和行为，要坚决贯彻团结改造知识分子的政策。
      （三）进一步克服学校工作中违犯教育政策和教育原则的现象，同时加强对学生的经常的政治思想教育，启发学生的学习积极性，巩固学习纪律，逐步提高教学效果。此外，必须采取各种措施改善学生健康状况。
      （四）加强中等学校中党的支部工作。学校中的党组织应该使政治思想工作与教学工作密切结合，以保证完成学校教育计划，提高教学和学习效果。因此党的各种工作都要围绕并服务于教学工作，过去，有些支部只管党务工作、不关心教学工作计划的执行、或者包揽行政事务、放松党的工作等偏向都应该及时纠正。
      （五）各级党委宣传部应进一步加强对中等学校的政治思想领导。首先应协同各级教育行政部门对各地中等学校继续有计划地进行一次深入的摸底工作，从而划分类型，分别提出改进工作的具体措施。对政治工作、教学工作和各种组织比较健全的学校，应加强领导，总结和推广他们的经验，有重点地改进教学工作；对政治工作、教学制度还很不健全和尚存有混乱现象的学校，应首先克服混乱现象，建立和健全经常的教学工作和政治工作制度；对尚存在若干严重问题的学校，必须组织力量进行重点检查，及时解决问题。为了进一步加强学校政治工作，各级党组织应认真实行定期检查所辖地区学校的制度，以便深入了解情况，及时解决问题改进工作。
