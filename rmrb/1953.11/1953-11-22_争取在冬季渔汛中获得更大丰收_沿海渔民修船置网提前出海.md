    Strive for a Greater Harvest in the Winter Fishing Season
    Coastal Fishermen Repair Boats and Prepare Nets to Go to Sea Early
    Fishermen in coastal fishing areas, under the strong leadership and support of local Party and government organs, are actively repairing boats and preparing nets, going to sea early. Some areas have already achieved a bumper harvest in the autumn fishing season, and now all areas are striving for a greater harvest in the winter fishing season.
    In order to organize fishermen to do a good job in the winter fishing season hairtail production, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces held marine fishing area work conferences in September and October respectively, to specifically study and arrange winter fishing season hairtail production work. In Zhejiang Province alone, the four special zones of Zhoushan, Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou have more than 8,000 fishing boats going to sea this winter fishing season, with more than 37,000 fishermen, and plan to catch about 570,000 dan of hairtail. In order to ensure the realization of this production target, the relevant units have jointly formed a winter fishing season headquarters to uniformly lead fishing production during the fishing season, and strive to do a good job in production, transportation, sales, supply, processing, and political education among fishermen. Zhejiang Province produced more than one million dan of large and small yellow croaker in the spring fishing season, exceeding the spring fishing season production of last year by 43 percent, and fishermen's income increased by 91 percent compared with the same period last year. After fishermen's incomes increased and their lives improved, they have purchased boats and added nets to expand reproduction. According to incomplete statistics from Wenzhou and Taizhou special zones since the spring fishing season, more than 1,400 new boats have been built. They have all gone to sea one after another. More than 190 fishing boats in Xiangshan County, led by the deputy director of the county farmers' association, have also gone to sea early. The county's economic departments have also sold more than 110,000 jin of rice, more than 150,000 jin of fishing salt, and loans of more than 200 million yuan on credit, to solve the financial difficulties of fishermen going to sea. After the Fujian Provincial Aquatic Products Work Conference, aquatic products departments in coastal areas also immediately cooperated with banks, salt bureaus, aquatic product companies, cooperatives and other departments to do a good job in loans, salt distribution, processing equipment and supply of production and living materials in a timely manner. The Pingtan County branch of the People's Bank of China had already distributed most of the more than 2 billion yuan in loans to fishermen by the end of September. After receiving the loans, the fishermen combined their own funds to build more than 140 new boats and repair more than 440 fishing boats. Because the loans were issued in a timely manner, most of the fixed nets were prepared half a month to a month earlier than last year, so they were able to hang the nets early and increase production. Guangdong Province's coastal fishing areas have achieved a bumper harvest in autumn fishing season production. The Shantouwei, Nanao, Guangao and other fishing grounds in the eastern Guangdong area have had particularly good harvests this year. The Shantouwei trawlers encountered yellow croaker schools on their first trip to sea in mid-September. Each pair of boats caught 15,000 to 20,000 jin of fish in three or four days. The harvest from each cast of the net increased by 50 percent compared with last year. It is estimated that the total amount of fish caught in this port this year can increase by 16 percent compared with last year, and the aquatic product company has correspondingly established and expanded processing plants and other processing equipment. Raoping County issued more than 1 billion yuan in fishing loans to help fishermen build 83 boats and set up more than 1,500 nets before the fishing season. The Feihu Fishery Production Mutual Aid Group in Zhelin Port of the county went to sea for production on October 20, and caught 145,000 jin of yellow croaker in one net, breaking the highest record in history. Fishermen in Shenwo Port, Huilai County, with the help of government loans, implemented the method of "repairing boats while going to sea, repairing one pair and sending one pair to sea," so that fishing boats could quickly go to sea for production. Nanao Fishing Ground caught more than 2.5 million jin of fish in September and October, exceeding the total amount of fish caught last year. The current output of other fishing grounds in western Guangdong, central Guangdong and Hainan is also higher than the output at the same time last year. State-owned aquatic product companies have vigorously carried out purchase, processing and transportation and sales work in various fishing areas, increased purchase funds, expanded fish pickling ponds, and set up more transfer stations to expand purchases and accelerate transportation and sales, and set appropriate purchase prices to avoid illegal merchants speculating and disrupting the market. In addition, fishermen in Guangxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Liaodong and other places are also actively producing under the leadership of the local government. After the issuance of fishing loans in Beihai City, Guangxi, the first batch of newly built boats in the Tokyo Bay fishing ground were launched in early September, and a bumper harvest has been achieved. Fishermen in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, produced more than 1.2 million jin of fish in September, and plan to produce a total of 10.69 million jin by the end of the year. In addition to issuing loans to support fishermen in difficulty, the leading organs of Wendeng County also held special meetings to study the organization of fishermen, improve operation technology, promote multiple operations, and mobilize men and women to use semi-labor forces to do their best to increase production. Fishermen in the Yellow Sea area of ​​Liaodong Province have achieved a bumper harvest this autumn. Among them, fishermen in Andong City have achieved the largest harvest in 20 years. The Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department has now sent a group of cadres to fishing villages to lead fishermen's production and strive for a greater harvest in winter.

    争取在冬季渔汛中获得更大丰收
    沿海渔民修船置网提前出海
    沿海各渔区渔民，在当地党政机关大力领导和支持下，积极修船置网，提前出海。部分地区在秋汛中已经获得丰收，现各地正争取冬季渔汛更大的丰收。
    浙江、福建两省为了组织渔民搞好冬汛带鱼生产，在九、十月份分别召开了海洋渔区工作会议，具体研究和布置冬汛带鱼生产工作。浙江省仅舟山、宁波、台州、温州四个专区今年冬汛出海渔船就有八千余只，出海渔民三万七千余人，计划要捕捉带鱼五十七万担左右。为保证这一生产指标的实现，各有关单位已联合组成冬汛指挥部，统一领导汛期渔业生产，力求做好产、运、销、供应和加工以及渔民中的政治教育工作。浙江省春汛中共生产大、小黄鱼百余万担，超过去年春汛生产百分之四十三，渔民收入比去年同期增加百分之九十一。渔民收入增加、生活改善后，纷纷置船添网，扩大再生产，据温州、台州两专区自春汛以来的不完全统计，已造好新船一千四百多只。目前都已先后下海。象山县一百九十多只渔船，在县农会副主任率领下也已经提前下海，该县各经济部门还分别赊销大米十一万多斤、渔盐十五万多斤、贷款二亿余元，解决渔民下海资金困难。福建省水产工作会议结束后，沿海各地水产部门也立即配合银行、盐务局、水产公司、合作社等部门，及时做好贷款、配盐、加工设备及供应生产、生活资料等工作。中国人民银行平潭县支行在九月底即已将二十余亿元贷款大部分发放到渔民手中，渔民们得到贷款后，结合自己资金共造新船一百四十余只，修补渔船四百四十余只。由于贷款发放及时，使大部分定置网都比去年早半个月到一个月准备停当，因而得以提早挂网，增加生产。广东省沿海渔区秋季渔汛生产已获得丰收。粤东区的汕尾、南澳、广澳等渔场，今年收成特别好，汕尾拖船九月中旬第一次出海，就遇上黄花鱼群，三、四天内每对船即捕鱼一万五千斤到两万斤，每一次下网的收获，比去年增加百分之五十。该港今年捕鱼总数量估计可比去年增加百分之十六，水产公司已相应地建立和扩大了加工厂及其他加工设备。饶平县发放渔贷十亿多元，帮助渔民在渔汛前造船八十三只，置网一千五百多张。该县柘林港飞虎渔业生产互助组在十月二十日出海生产，一次网就捕得黄花鱼十四万五千斤，打破历史上最高纪录。惠来县神沃港渔民在政府贷款帮助下，实行
  “边修船边落海，修好一对出海一对”的办法，使得渔船迅速出海生产。南澳渔场九、十两月共已捕鱼二百五十多万斤，超过去年全年捕鱼量。其他粤西、粤中和海南等地渔场的目前产量也都比去年同时的产量增加。国营水产公司在各渔区的机构已大力开展收购、加工和运销工作、增加收购资金、扩大腌鱼池、增设调拨站，以扩大收购和加速运销，并定出适当收购价格，避免不法商人投机扰乱市场。此外，广西、江苏、山东、辽东等地渔民也都在当地政府领导下积极生产。广西北海市发放渔贷后，东京湾渔场第一批新造船已在九月初放海，并已获得丰收。山东文登县渔民在九月份已产鱼一百二十余万斤，计划到年底共生产一千零六十九万斤。文登县领导机关除发放贷款扶持困难渔民外，并召开专门会议，研究组织渔民，提高作业技术，提倡多种作业，发动男女整半劳动力各尽所能，以增加产量。辽东省黄海方面渔民今年获得秋季丰收。其中安东市渔民获得二十年来最大的一次丰收。该省人民政府农业厅现又派一批干部到渔村去领导渔民生产，争取冬季更大的丰收。（翟作标　王世贤　郁胜源　蔡长洋  洪泉声　张怡展　张忠林　周兰荪  杜庚　陈雷　朱锦荣）
