The state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Northeast, North China, Central and South China, and other places, in coordination with the grain and cotton purchasing work, are actively transferring and supplying materials needed by farmers.

    This year, the state-owned commercial departments in the Northeast region have a large quantity and variety of winter materials in hand, and are fully supplying the vast rural areas. The Northeast China Department Store plans to supply 36,000 tons of cotton clothing to the market this year. The supply of department store goods in the fourth quarter of this year increased by 33.1 percent compared with the same period last year. Among them, the annual supply of sugar, which is heavily consumed in rural areas after autumn, increased by 44.2 percent compared with last year; glass increased by 34.4 percent. The cold-proof products organized by state-owned commercial departments this year appropriately take into account the characteristics of rural areas in various places. In Heilongjiang Province, the coldest province, more than 20 kinds of fur hats of different sizes and qualities are supplied to consumers this year, of which rough fur hats such as Siberian hamster, dog skin, and wolf skin account for 80 percent. The province has also prepared materials with strong cold resistance, such as "Wende" (a kind of light and warm high-top leather boots) that are popular among farmers in the Heihe area on the national border. Recently, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee decided to lower the prices of some daily necessities commonly used by farmers. For example, the price of socks, which are increasingly demanded in rural areas, was reduced by 3.61 percent, and other blue cloth, soap, thread, towels, etc. have also been reduced. At present, state-owned companies in various places are continuing to expand transfers to rural areas, and grassroots cooperatives in various places are also actively organizing purchases.
    The Supply and Management Department of the North China Cooperative Federation, in coordination with the cotton and grain purchasing work in various places, is transferring a large quantity and variety of industrial products to various places in a timely and continuous manner to meet the needs of farmers. This year, the Supply and Management Department of the North China Cooperative Federation has expanded the supply of industrial products according to the quantity of cotton and grain purchased in various places and the needs of farmers for industrial products. From the beginning of October to the beginning of November, the total value of industrial products supplied to various places has reached more than 243.4 billion yuan, equivalent to half of the total supply in the whole year of last year. The supply of many commodities has increased by one to two times compared with the same period last year. Among the goods supplied, various blue fabrics, fancy serge, gabardine, khaki, etc. account for 60 percent of the total supply, in addition to a large number of scarves, cotton socks, sweaters, various stationery and groceries, as well as plum red paper, wax, star anise, New Year pictures and other New Year goods. In order to enable a large number of industrial products to be quickly sent to the countryside and accelerate the turnover of funds, the employees of the Supply and Management Department of the North China Cooperative Federation actively put forward rationalization proposals to improve storage and transportation work. For example, the warehouses under the department implemented the "contract payment and delivery method" and the "inventory system by category", which simplified transportation procedures and commodity inventory accounts. With the cooperation of relevant transportation departments, the commodity circulation was accelerated by an average of seven and a half days compared with the past, which not only enabled farmers to get their favorite goods in time, but also reduced the backlog of funds by 41 billion yuan in October. Recently, the Supply and Management Department of the North China Cooperative Federation held an expanded business organization meeting of cooperatives in Tianjin. The meeting organized state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Tianjin to sign supply and marketing contracts with cooperatives in various places with a total value of more than 220 billion yuan, supplying a large number of industrial products urgently needed by farmers to various places. Now, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Tianjin are transporting a large number of industrial products traded at the meeting to various places in order to supply farmers early and support the work of purchasing cotton, grain, native and special products. The state-owned trade departments in Hebei Province attach great importance to the supply of materials in the large-scale purchase of grain and cotton. On November 4, the inspection team of the state-owned trade department went to various places to conduct inspections. At the same time, various specialized companies also transferred a large number of cadres to specifically assist their subordinate units in organizing the supply of materials. At present, relevant departments in Hebei Province are transferring a large number of materials to cotton-producing areas to supply cotton farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Hebei Province are preparing 244 million catties of various fertilizers in the fourth quarter. The Provincial Cotton and Yarn Company has now prepared 4.39 million pieces of various fabrics with bright colors and beautiful patterns. Other department stores, petroleum, coal and other materials have been continuously transported to rural cotton areas.
    The vast rural market in Central and South China has entered the season of material exchange of "golden September and silver October" in the lunar calendar. State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various places, in coordination with the purchase of grain and cotton, have strengthened the supply of materials to rural areas. The supply of industrial products to rural areas in the Central and South China region in the fourth quarter of this year will exceed the supply in the same period of any year after liberation. Since November, state-owned commercial departments in various places have successively cleared and allocated warehouse materials, and quickly transferred a large number of materials sold in rural areas to grain, cotton and other economic crop producing areas. The state-owned commercial system in Wuhan has transferred pig iron, steel, cloth, department stores, cigarettes, coal, pigments, iron nails and other items worth several hundred billion yuan to grain and cotton producing areas in Hubei. Rubber-tired cart tires and medicines, which have been needed in rural Henan for a long time, are also being transported from Wuhan and Guangzhou. At present, cooperatives in various places are actively preparing for fertilizer supply. The chemical fertilizer prepared for supply in December alone will reach more than 60,000 tons. In order to deliver these materials to farmers in a timely manner, the cooperation between state-owned commercial departments and rural supply and marketing cooperatives has become closer than before. In many counties in Hubei Province, state-owned commercial departments have sent people to rural areas to help grassroots cooperatives develop their businesses.

    【本报讯】东北、华北、中南等地国营商业部门和合作社，配合购粮购棉工作，积极调拨和供应农民需要的物资。
    今年，东北区国营商业部门掌握了数量庞大和种类繁多的冬季物资，正充分供应广大农村。东北区百货公司今年计划供应到市场上的棉衣达三万六千吨。百货用品今年第四季度供应量比去年同期增加了百分之三十三点一。其中秋后农村消耗量较大的糖类，今年全年供应量比去年增加了百分之四十四点二；玻璃增加了百分之三十四点四。国营商业部门今年所组织的防寒品适当照顾了各地农村的特点。最冷的黑龙江省今年供应给消费者不同规模质量的皮帽子达二十多种，其中川鼠、狗皮、狼皮等粗皮帽子达百分之八十。该省并为国境线上的黑河专区农民准备了他们所喜爱的“温得”（一种轻而暖的高装皮靴）等抗寒力较强的物资。最近，东北财政经济委员会又决定降低了一部分农民普遍需用的日常用品价格，如农村要求逐渐增多的袜子价格降低了百分之三点六一，其他青蓝布匹、肥皂、线、毛巾等都有降低。目前，各地国营公司正在继续扩大对农村的调拨，各地基层合作社也正在积极组织进货。
    华北合作总社供应经营处，配合各地购棉购粮工作，正将数量庞大、多种多样的工业品及时源源调往各地，供应农民需要。今年，华北合作总社供应经营处根据各地收购棉粮数量和农民需要工业品的情况，扩大了工业品的供应数量，从十月初到十一月上旬，供应各地工业品总值已达二千四百三十四亿余元，相当于去年全年供应总额的一半。其中许多商品的供应数量都较去年同期增加了一倍到两倍。在供应的货品中，各种青蓝色布、花哔叽、华达呢、卡其等占供应总量的百分之六十，此外还有大量的围巾、棉毛袜、毛衣、各种文具和杂货，以及梅红纸、洋蜡、大茴、年画等多种多样的年货。为使大批工业品迅速下乡、加速资金周转，华北合作总社供应经营处职工积极提出合理化建议，改进储运工作。如该处所属仓库实行了“包付包发办法”、“按类分库存货制”，简化了运输手续和商品库存账目，并在有关运输部门配合下，使商品流转较过去平均加快了七天半，不仅使农民能及时得到他们心爱的货品，而且在十月份减少积压的资金达四百一十亿元。最近，华北合作总社供应经营处召开了天津区合作社扩大业务组织会议。会议组织天津市国营商业部门及合作社与各地合作社签订了总值两千二百多亿元的供销合同协议，向各地供应农民迫切需要的大量工业品。现在，天津市国营商业部门与合作社，正将在会议上成交的大量工业品源源运往各地，以便提早供应农民，支持收购棉粮和土、特产品的工作。河北省国营贸易部门十分重视大量收购粮、棉中的物资供应工作，十一月四日国营贸易部门的检查组已到各地进行检查。同时各专业公司也抽出一大批干部，具体协助所属单位组织物资供应工作。现河北省各有关部门正把大批物资调往产棉区供应棉农。河北省各级供销合作社第四季度准备各种肥料二亿四千多万斤。省花纱布公司现已准备好色泽鲜艳、花样美丽的各种布四百三十九万匹。其他百货、石油、煤炭等物资已源源运到棉区农村。
    中南广大农村市场已进入农历“金九银十”的物资大交流季节，各地国营商业部门和合作社配合粮棉收购，加强农村物资供应。中南区今年第四季供应农村的工业品将超过解放后任何一年同期的供应数量。各地国营商业部门自十一月份以来，纷纷清查和调配仓存物资，把行销农村的大批物资迅速调往粮棉和其他经济作物产区。武汉市国营商业系统调往湖北粮棉产区的生铁、钢、布匹、百货、纸烟、煤、颜料、铁钉等值数千亿元。河南农村长期需要的胶轮马车轮胎和医药用品，也正由武汉、广州调运中。现各地合作社正积极准备肥料供应。仅十二月份准备供应的化学肥料一项就达六万多吨。为了把这些物资及时送到农民手里，国营商业部门和农村供销合作社的配合已较前密切。湖北省有不少县的国营商业部门，已派人到农村帮助基层合作社开展业务。
