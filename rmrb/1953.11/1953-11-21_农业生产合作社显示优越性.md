Agricultural Production Cooperatives Show Superiority
    Most Cooperatives in Northeast China Achieve Bumper Harvests
    Currently, the harvest in Northeast China is complete. Judging from the results, most agricultural production cooperatives have achieved bumper harvests. This year, there are more than 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the Northeast rural areas, including more than 3,700 pilot cooperatives. Most agricultural production cooperatives have implemented the principle of prioritizing agricultural production, achieving "good production, fewer burdens, lighter debts, and less waste," resulting in increased income for cooperative members. According to a survey of 312 agricultural production cooperatives in nine counties in Songjiang Province (Shuangcheng, Lalin), Heilongjiang Province (Keshan, Suihua, Kaitong), Jilin Province (Yongji), Rehe Province (Chaoyang), Liaoxi Province (Zhangwu), and Liaodong Province (Hailong), more than 88% of the cooperatives had better production results than mutual aid teams. The Xingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangwu County, Liaoxi Province, harvested a total of 100 shi of grain last year, and is expected to harvest more than 390 shi this year. The Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang can earn 40 to 50 jin of grain per labor day this year, nearly double that of last year.
    Members' Income Generally Increased
    This year, the income of members of agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province has generally increased compared with last year. The agricultural production cooperatives newly established this year in the Xinzhou and Yanbei regions generally increased production by 40% to 50% compared with last year, with the highest increase exceeding 80%. Agricultural production cooperatives in the southeastern part of Shanxi Province, which suffered more severe drought, generally increased production by 10% to 15% compared with last year. Due to the general increase in the output of agricultural production cooperatives, the income of members has also generally increased accordingly. In the Changzhi region, 87% of the agricultural production cooperatives saw an increase in members' income of about 8% compared with last year. In Jincheng and Changzi counties, 27% of the agricultural production cooperatives in each county saw an increase in income for each member household compared to last year. In Gaoping County, 1,456 households of members in 60 agricultural production cooperatives generally increased their income by 27% compared with last year, which is 24% more than the local farmers this year. In the northern Yingxian, Youyu, and Guoxian counties, and the central Yuci county, 80% of the members of agricultural production cooperatives generally had incomes exceeding 20% of last year, with the highest exceeding 40%.

    Production Results Better Than Mutual Aid Teams
    The agricultural production cooperatives piloted in Sichuan Province generally had better harvests this year than mutual aid teams and individual farmers. According to a survey of seven cooperatives, the average wheat yield was more than 16% higher than that of local mutual aid teams and 34% higher than that of individual farmers. For example, the Qiugongsong Cooperative in Zizhong produced an average of 285 jin of wheat per mu this year, while the Qiugongwen mutual aid team in the same village only produced an average of 231 jin per mu. The Liaojiucheng Cooperative in Suining produced 358 jin of wheat per mu, while seven local individual farmers produced an average of only 264 jin per mu. The Guotianjin Cooperative in Dazhu County had an average rice yield of 603.5 jin per mu, which was 52 jin more than the average yield of 551.5 jin per mu for local mutual aid teams, and 66 jin more than the average of 537.5 jin per mu for individual farmers. The unit area yield of rice in agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province exceeded the provincial average yield by 38%. Because organizing increased productivity and produced more grain, agricultural production cooperatives have become increasingly consolidated. For example, Li Xingfu, a member of the Guotianjin Cooperative in Dazhu County, said: "This year's corn harvest is more than double that of last year. Without the cooperative, it would not have been possible." Many individual farmers regard cooperatives as locomotives, wanting to follow them and striving to join the cooperatives themselves.
    Planting What is Suitable, Exploiting the Potential of Mountain Land
    The land of the Wang Zhangcun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangjiaao, Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, is scattered in the mountains, mostly in fragmented plots of about 0.1 to 0.5 mu, with very few plots exceeding 1 mu, making cultivation difficult. In addition, the climate there is cold, so it is generally not easy to increase yields. However, the Wang Zhangcun Agricultural Production Cooperative, by organizing, can unlock the potential of the land and fully utilize the conditions for increasing production. After the cooperative was organized, it first broke the limitations of individual operation that only allowed people to "plant what they eat," and implemented a method of adapting to local conditions and unified allocation, so that the land was "planted with what is suitable." For example, the cooperative's land was suitable for growing corn, so it planted 57 mu more this year, and it was not suitable for growing millet, so it planted 51 mu less this year. Also, because the cooperative brought out the role of organizing, it worked hard to process the land, apply more fertilizer, cultivate in a timely manner, implement close planting, and plant improved varieties, which greatly increased the yield of food crops. The average grain yield of the whole cooperative was 269 jin per mu, which was more than 34% higher than the average yield of 200 jin per mu in the whole village. In terms of the entire village, this year's yield per mu was 15 jin lower than last year due to natural disasters, but the Wang Zhangcun Agricultural Production Cooperative, due to organized collective management, not only did not reduce production but also increased the grain yield by 54.5 jin per mu compared with last year.

      Collective Research on Technology, Improving Yield
    Members of the Yu Songchang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Southwest Tai Village, Fourth District, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, this year studied and improved cultivation techniques, seized the key to increasing production, and achieved an overall bumper harvest of corn. The cooperative planted a total of 38 mu of corn this year, with an actual yield of 12,806 jin, an average of 337 jin per mu, an increase of 105 jin compared with the average of 232 jin per mu in the whole village, and an increase of 98 jin compared with the average of 239 jin per mu for the Yu Xianchen mutual aid team. The cooperative, based on the characteristics of the local land being thin and the drought this year, carried out deep plowing, fine harrowing, and multiple hoeing to maintain the moisture of the land, so that the corn grew strong throughout. In addition, the cooperative selected the corn seed that was most suitable for the local soil conditions, carried out close planting, and applied fertilizer in stages and at the right time, making full use of the fertilizer's power, which was also the key to increasing corn production. After the autumn harvest, the members found the key to increasing production this year, believing that it was mainly because the cooperative members jointly studied and improved the technology based on the actual local conditions. After this study, the members became more clear about the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives, and their confidence in improving production became even higher. Non-member Yu Qinghua said: "I have been following the cooperative for almost a year, but I can't keep up. My labor costs are higher than the cooperative's, but the grain I harvested is not as much as the cooperative's. I am convinced by the momentum of improving production technology, and I will definitely learn technology from the cooperative in the future."

      Women and Children Also Do Their Best
    The HePing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nehe County, Heilongjiang, distributed the wheat harvested this year in October. The distribution results greatly demonstrated the superiority of organizing and fully utilizing labor potential. The cooperative implemented a contracting system this year, and even women and children participated in production, which ensured timely cultivation and did not affect production even when weeds grew densely. As a result, 37 qing of wheat achieved a large-scale production increase of one time than local production. At the time of wheat distribution, all male and female members and children of the cooperative received their due labor remuneration. Member Sha Wenzhi received 1,996 jin of net wheat. The women, younger brother, and younger daughter in their family received a total of 2,004 jin, and the whole family received a total of 4,000 jin of wheat. Female member Xin Lirong also received 353 jin of wheat. Sha Wenzhen was only twelve years old and received 245 jin. Gao Xuelan, who is only in the first grade of primary school this year, also received 81 jin of wheat.

      New Record for High Yield of Corn
    The corn planted by the Wu Xicheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, has achieved an overall bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of more than ten mu of corn was 1,157 jin, of which the average yield per mu of more than two mu was 1,300 jin, creating a new record for high yield production. The average yield per mu of corn in the entire cooperative was 557 jin higher than the average yield of local farmers. The Wu Xicheng Agricultural Production Cooperative gave full play to the role of organizing this year, and implemented intensive cultivation, which is the main reason for their high yield. The Wu Xicheng Agricultural Production Cooperative's cornfields were ploughed while harvesting last autumn. They achieved deep autumn plowing, shallow spring plowing, early autumn plowing, more plowing, and deep plowing, early spring plowing, shallow plowing, and fine plowing. The cooperative also implemented multiple harrowing and fine harrowing. Because of such careful land preparation, the soil was broken up, water was stored and moisture was retained, and pests were reduced, creating conditions for complete emergence and vigorous growth of crops. The Wu Xicheng Agricultural Production Cooperative also implemented appropriate close planting and rational fertilization in stages, evenly distributing the land's fertility, and achieving "dense seedlings and many ears," resulting in more grain. In addition, the cooperative also implemented seedling setting in stages, fine hoeing and soil preparation, and paid attention to fighting against natural disasters, ensuring complete seedling emergence and protecting the growing crops from damage.

    农业生产合作社显示优越性
    东北多数合作社获得丰收
    目前东北区庄稼已经收割完毕，根据收获结果看来，大部的农业生产合作社都获得丰收。今年东北农村有五千多个农业生产合作社，其中试办的三千七百多个。大部分农业生产合作社贯彻了以农业生产为主的方针，做到了“生产好、摊子少、债务轻、浪费少”，社员收入增多。据松江省的双城、拉林，黑龙江省的克山、绥化、开通，吉林省的永吉，热河省的朝阳，辽西省的彰武和辽东省的海龙等九个县试办的三百十二个农业生产合作社调查，百分之八十八以上的社生产成绩都比互助组好。辽西省彰武县星星农业生产合作社去年共收获粮食一百石，今年可收获三百九十多石。沈阳市郊高坎农业生产合作社今年每个劳动日可得四十斤到五十斤粮食，比去年增加近一倍。
    社员收入普遍增加
    今年，山西省各地农业生产合作社，社员收入普遍比去年增加。忻县专区和雁北专区今年新建立的农业生产合作社，一般比去年增产百分之四十到五十，最高增产百分之八十以上。遭受旱灾较重的山西省东南部一带的农业生产合作社，一般也比去年增产百分之十到十五。由于农业生产合作社的产量普遍增加，社员收入相应地也普遍增加。长治专区有百分之八十七的农业生产合作社，社员收入比去年增加百分之八左右。晋城、长子两县各有百分之二十七的农业生产合作社，每户社员收入都超过去年。高平县六十个农业生产合作社一千四百五十六户社员，一般收入比去年增加百分之二十七，比今年当地农民多百分之二十四。北部应县、右玉、崞县和中部榆次等县的农业生产合作社，一般有百分之八十的社员收入超过去年百分之二十，最高超过百分之四十以上。（据新华社讯）
    生产成绩都比互助组好
    四川省试办的农业生产合作社，今年的收成一般都比互助组好、比个体农民更好。据七个社的调查，小麦平均比当地互助组多产百分之十六以上，比个体农民多产百分之三十四，其中如资中邱功松社，今年平均一亩小麦产二百八十五斤，而该村邱功文互助组每亩平均只产了二百三十一斤。遂宁廖九成社一亩小麦产三百五十八斤，当地七户个体农民每亩平均只产二百六十四斤。大竹县郭天金社，每亩水稻平均产量是六百零三斤半，比当地互助组每亩平均产量五百五十一斤半，多增产五十二斤，比个体农民每亩平均五百三十七斤半，多增产六十六斤。全省农业生产合作社水稻的单位面积产量，超过全省平均产量百分之三十八。由于组织起来提高了生产率，多产了粮食，因此，使农业生产合作社日益得到了巩固。如大竹县郭天金社的社员李兴富说：“今年的苞谷比去年要多收一倍多，不是合作社那能打得出来。”许多个体农民都把合作社当作火车头，要跟着它走，并且争取自己也参加合作社。
  收啥种啥，发挥了山地潜力
    山西平顺县张家凹王张存农业生产合作社的土地都分散在山地里，大部是一至五分左右的零星地块，一亩以上的地块很少，耕作困难；加以那里气候寒冷，所以一般产量不容易提高。但是王张存农业生产合作社，由于组织起来，就能发挥土地的潜在力，充分利用了增产的条件。该社组织起来以后，首先就打破了个体经营只能“吃啥种啥”的限制，实行因地制宜、统一调配的办法，做到了土地“收啥种啥”。如该社土地适宜种玉茭，今年就多种了五十七亩，不适于种谷子，今年就少种了五十一亩。又由于该社发挥了组织起来的作用，在土地上努力加工，增施肥料，适时耕作，实行密植和种植优良品种，使粮食作物的产量大大提高了。全社每亩平均产粮二百六十九斤，超过全村每亩平均二百斤的产量百分之三十四多。按全村看来，今年因为遭受自然灾害，每亩比去年产量低了十五斤，但王张存农业生产合作社由于组织起来集体经营，不但没有减产，反而每亩比去年增产了五十四斤半粮食。（张先富、新芳、忠义）
      集体研究技术，提高产量
    山东省文登县四区西南台村于松长农业生产合作社社员，今年研究和改进了耕作技术，抓住了增产关键，使玉米得到全面丰收。该社今年共种玉米三十八亩，实产量一万二千八百零六斤，每亩平均三百三十七斤，比全村每亩平均二百三十二斤增产了一百零五斤，比于显臣互助组每亩平均二百三十九斤增产九十八斤。该社根据当地土地薄，今年又天旱的特点，进行了深耕、细耙、多锄，保持了土地的水分，使玉米生长始终壮旺。此外，该社并选种了最适合当地土质条件的玉米种，进行了密植和分期适时施肥，作到了肥尽其力，也是玉米增产的关键。秋收结束以后，社员找出了今年增产的关键，认为主要是因为合作社社员共同研究，根据当地实际情况改进了技术。经过这一研究，社员对于农业生产合作社的好处更加清楚了，提高生产的信心更高。非社员于清华说：“我跟着合作社跑了将近一年，老是跟不上，我的工本比社下的多，但打的粮食没有社的多，我可信服改进生产技术这股子劲头了，往后一定跟社学技术。”

      妇女小孩也各尽所能
    黑龙江讷河县和平农业生产合作社，在十月里分配了今年收的小麦，分配的结果，大大显示了组织起来，能充分发挥劳动潜力的优越性。该社今年实行了包工制，连妇女、小孩都参加了生产，这就保证了适时耕作，在草苗齐长的情况下，也没有使生产受到影响。结果三十七垧小麦获得比当地高一倍的大面积增产。在小麦分配时，全社男、女社员和小孩都分得了应得的劳动报酬。社员沙文志分得净小麦一千九百九十六斤，他们家里妇女、小弟弟、小姑娘共分得二千零四斤，全家共分得四千斤小麦。妇女社员辛利荣也分得了小麦三百五十三斤，沙文珍才十二岁，分得二百四十五斤，高雪蓝今年才上一年级小学，也分得小麦八十一斤。

      玉茭丰产新纪录
    山西太原市第五区武喜成农业生产合作社所种的玉茭全面丰收了。十亩多玉茭，每亩平均产量是一千一百五十七斤，其中有二亩多每亩平均产量是一千三百斤，创造了高额丰产新纪录。全社玉茭的每亩平均产量比当地农民平均产量高五百五十七斤。武喜成农业生产合作社今年充分发挥了组织起来的作用，实行深耕细作，是他们获得高额产量的主要原因。武喜成农业生产合作社的玉茭地，在去年秋收时，就边收边耕。作到了秋耕深，春耕浅，秋季早耕多耕深耕，春季早耕浅耕细耕。该社并实行多耙和细耙。由于这样精细整地，就使土壤细碎，存水保墒，虫害减少，为作物出苗齐全、生长健旺创造了条件。武喜成农业生产合作社，还实行了适当密植和分期合理施肥的办法，均匀发挥地力，作到了“苗苗稠，穗穗多”，多打粮食。此外，该社还实行分期定苗，细锄培土，并注意和自然灾害作斗争，使苗出得齐全，保护长出的庄稼不受损失。
