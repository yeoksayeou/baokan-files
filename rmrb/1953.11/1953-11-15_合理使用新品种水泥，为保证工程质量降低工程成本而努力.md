    Rationally Use New Varieties of Cement, Strive to Guarantee Project Quality and Reduce Project Costs
    Chen Yuntao, Director of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry
    Currently, various engineering departments are tirelessly striving to fulfill the basic construction tasks of the motherland's Five-Year Plan. The great industrial construction plan requires all kinds of building materials, among which the supply of cement is particularly urgent. According to advanced Soviet experience, there are two ways to ensure that cement can meet construction needs: one is to increase the variety of cement, producing a wide variety of cement with different grades to meet the needs of various types of construction; the other is for the state to strictly regulate the scope of use of high-grade cement and formulate special regulations for the use of cement, so that various types of cement can be used economically and rationally in construction. This first requires the cement production departments to quickly engage in the research of cement varieties and produce a wide variety of cement according to the needs of various national constructions. Secondly, it requires the using departments to adopt various types of cement according to the different nature of the projects, to achieve the goal of reducing project costs, greatly saving national basic construction investment, and saving national resources while ensuring project quality.
    The advanced Soviet cement industry began the production of multi-variety, multi-grade cement after the victory of the October Revolution. After decades of continuous improvement and expansion, there are now more than fifty names of cement. However, in pre-revolutionary Russia, there were only three types of cement, the strength of which was only equivalent to today's medium-grade cement. The strength was half that of today's high-grade cement, that is to say, the quality of Soviet cement is now more than doubled compared to the past.
    After decades of research and improvement, Soviet cement has achieved a high level of technical achievement. In addition to the continuous improvement of the quality of high-grade cement, a large amount of low-grade cement has also been produced, with its production proportion on par with that of high-grade cement. For example, 600, 500, and 400 grade high-grade cement only account for 50 percent of the total production; the remaining half is medium-grade and low-grade cement. Experience has proved that in actual construction, using other types of cement is better than silicate cement (i.e., pure cement without admixtures) in many places. Its manufacturing cost is also lower than silicate cement, and in some projects, using high-grade cement not only causes a waste of project costs but also reduces project quality. Taking hydraulic engineering as an example, using high-grade silicate cement will damage hydraulic structures. Therefore, the Soviet Union has explicit regulations in hydraulic engineering that silicate cement without water-hardening admixtures must not be used.
    Advanced Soviet experience also proves that the development of the cement industry must be carried out in three aspects. That is to say, in addition to the efforts of cement industry workers, there must also be close cooperation from builders and the attention and mutual promotion of scientific research institutions and experimental departments. Otherwise, the promotion of multi-variety, multi-grade cement will encounter various obstacles and will not be easy to achieve.
    I. Learn from advanced Soviet experience, expand cement varieties, and meet construction needs
    China's cement industry has always adopted the technical methods of British and American capitalist countries for production. In 1950, with the help of Soviet cement experts, we began to learn from advanced Soviet experience, and after two years of experimentation and trial production, we officially turned to mass production in 1952. In the past, we only produced one grade of cement, that is, silicate cement with a 28-day compressive strength standard of 150 kg and an actual production of 220 kg or more (referring to the Japanese standard soft mixing method, which is equivalent to about 300 or more grades of hard mixing). Although the specified grade was 200 or more (i.e., 150 kg), in fact, in order to facilitate sales, each factory not only generally raised it to 500 or more, but also emphasized the standard specifications of British and American capitalist countries, opposing the addition of any admixtures. This phenomenon was first corrected by cement factories in Northeast China in 1952, breaking the old technical viewpoints and beginning to move towards the Soviet road of multi-variety, multi-grade cement. The production of cement was classified into five types: ordinary cement, blast furnace cement, shale cement, sandstone cement, and loess cement; the grades of cement were also divided into five grades: 600, 500, 400, 300, and 200. A total of twenty-three kinds of admixtures were collected and tested. These admixtures are all excellent materials for manufacturing cement, and formal production can be carried out as long as construction requires it. In terms of variety, oil well cement has begun to be produced according to the needs of customers, and other cements such as waterproof and acid-resistant cement are also under research.
    Due to learning from advanced Soviet experience and engaging in the production of multi-variety, multi-grade cement, the output of cement in Northeast China in 1952, under the condition that no equipment was added to the original factories and mines, increased by more than 25 percent over the plan, and the cost was reduced by about 10 percent, which is equivalent to increasing the annual output of a medium-sized cement factory. Since the National Cement Technology Conference was held in November 1952, whether state-owned cement factories, joint state-private cement factories, or private cement factories have been actively collecting admixtures for testing and analysis, preparing to mass-produce multi-variety, multi-grade cement to supply the needs of national construction.
    Learning from advanced Soviet experience and producing multi-variety, multi-grade cement can not only increase output, but also significantly improve cement quality. First of all, due to the scientific guarantee of adopting different grades of cement for various types of projects, the phenomenon of abusing high-grade cement has begun to be overcome. For example, in the past, only one grade of cement was produced (i.e., the 28-day compressive strength standard was specified as 150 kg, and the actual production was 220 kg or more), and any project was constructed with this type of cement. Using such high-grade cement for bricklaying, plastering walls, and grouting joints is obviously a great waste. Especially for large-scale dams such as water conservancy and hydropower, not only is the heat of hydration of this pure cement high, which easily causes spalling, but more seriously, because pure cement lacks resistance to fresh water, it is in danger of gradually collapsing after being eroded by water. Conversely, cement mixed with admixtures completely avoids these external invasions because it is mixed with materials with special properties such as corrosion protection. This is a concrete manifestation of the superior quality of cement mixed with admixtures.
    II. Cement mixed with admixtures has demonstrated superior performance in actual construction
    The implementation of new product cement has been assisted by research departments, experimental departments, and construction departments, and has been supported by higher authorities. After the Northeast Industry Department issued the decision to use cement mixed with admixtures before 1952, the balancing department allocated various types of cement according to the needs of the project nature of various departments, and printed and distributed the book "Cement, Mortar, Concrete" (excerpted and translated from the Soviet Architect's Handbook) as technical guidance for construction. This measure has received great results. Based on our organization of specialized groups to go deep into major construction departments to check the quality of new varieties of cement, we believe that Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a good example of using cement mixed with admixtures. The company not only has relatively complete testing equipment, but also truly follows advanced Soviet experience to achieve a reasonable mix ratio when using cement. Although the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects of Angang expressed doubts when they first used cement mixed with admixtures and raised the concrete mix to a higher grade, the results of half a year of on-site testing proved that this increase was a waste, and a correction has been proposed this year. According to comrades in charge of on-site construction at Angang: under the three conditions of mechanical mixing, having a laboratory to implement the inspection system and control quality, and implementing operating procedures, the concrete grade should not be increased. The company's concrete test records show that using the current grade of cement and following the mix ratio introduced in the book "Cement, Mortar, Concrete" can achieve the expected concrete grade. This indirectly proves that the current cement grade is consistent with the Soviet cement grade. The reason why Anshan Iron and Steel Company has achieved this result is mainly because they can study and grasp the characteristics of cement mixed with admixtures, formulate operating procedures to implement them to workers, and use the characteristic of cement mixed with admixtures that it solidifies slowly, to solve the summer construction problem and fully demonstrate the superiority of cement mixed with admixtures.
    The above facts make us realize that the use of cement mixed with admixtures must first study its special properties and truly follow the advanced Soviet use methods in construction to fully demonstrate the superiority of cement mixed with admixtures. Taking the problem of dry shrinkage cracks in cement as an example, according to Soviet regulations, maintenance must be strengthened early, and concrete mixed with admixtures must be maintained for at least fourteen days. Technical personnel of the engineering company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry recognized the characteristics of dry shrinkage and adopted the method of early covering and strengthening maintenance. The phenomenon of cracks was completely prevented in 10,000 square meters of construction, and even the floor slabs that had cracked in the early stage disappeared due to strengthened maintenance; this improved workers' confidence in using cement mixed with admixtures. In addition, because the cement mixed with admixtures sets more slowly, which is the thing that everyone is most dissatisfied with, the large construction site of Angang used this characteristic to solve the problem of the combination of upper and lower layers caused by the long transportation distance and large area in summer construction.
    III. Obstacles in thinking must be overcome, regulations for use must be established, and the phenomenon of waste must be eliminated
    In the past two years, in the process of promoting advanced Soviet experience and producing multi-variety, multi-grade cement, many difficulties have been caused in work due to our insufficient subjective efforts. The main shortcomings are that the publicity of new varieties of cement is insufficient, and the characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of cement mixed with admixtures have not been fully publicized in a timely manner, so that everyone can quickly recognize the problems that should be paid attention to when using it. At the same time, when the production technology has not reached proficiency, the quality control is very volatile; when changing the mixed materials, the using departments have not been notified in time to pay attention, so as to control it in operation, which has caused doubts and dissatisfaction among the using departments, and even caused unnecessary losses in construction, which is worthy of our deep review. However, on the other hand, the existence of various ideological obstacles has also increased the difficulty in promoting cement mixed with admixtures. First of all, most of our technical personnel were accustomed to the cement technology theory of British and American capitalist countries when they began to manufacture cement, and expressed doubts or even took an antagonistic attitude in learning advanced Soviet cement technology methods. On the side of construction technical personnel, they encountered serious conservative ideas. They are accustomed to using single-variety, single-grade cement, so they believe that the Soviet multi-variety, multi-grade cement is too troublesome to use, and they think that low-grade cement is crudely made and refuse to use it. According to our investigation of the cement usage of various engineering departments in 1952, in some departments, because most of the technical personnel had prejudices against cement mixed with admixtures, they used a concrete mix of 140 when designing required 110, wasting 12 to 15 percent of the cement; some construction units even raised it by two grades, using a mix of 170, and used 400-grade cement as 300-grade, wasting about 15 percent of the cement; a more serious situation was using 200-grade cement as white ash, not studying cement performance, not paying attention to operating procedures, and once a problem occurred in the project, they did not conduct in-depth research, and attributed all the reasons to cement mixed with admixtures, which is a more common phenomenon. According to the Northeast Coal Construction Company, the general users (mainly referring to state-owned enterprises) require 500-grade cement as the best, followed by 400-grade ordinary cement, otherwise they want 400-grade cement mixed with admixtures, and only want 300 and 200-grade cement when there is no other choice; some said that they have to take it because the higher authorities allocated it. This situation shows that there are still many using units that have incorrect views on cement mixed with admixtures, thereby hindering the expanded use of cement mixed with admixtures.
    IV. Production, using, and other departments must cooperate closely and strive together to increase cement varieties
    In summary, it shows that after China's cement industry learned from advanced Soviet experience to carry out production reforms, not only did the output increase and the quality improve, ensuring the cement supply during the period of national industrial restoration and reconstruction, but also laid the foundation for the supply of future planned economic construction, and opened up a broad road for future producers and users. Because the requirements of ensuring project quality and reducing project costs have been achieved in the practical process, it is completely necessary and possible to further expand the production of new varieties and low-grade cement and strive to gradually improve the current situation where high-grade cement accounts for more than 80 percent of the total output. The key is to continue to learn from advanced Soviet experience, improve the technical level of production and cement use, and make producers, users, and research departments cooperate closely and work together to ensure the supply of new varieties of cement with more output, better quality, and lower cost.

    合理使用新品种水泥，为保证工程质量降低工程成本而努力
    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局局长　陈云涛
    目前，各工程部门正在为实现祖国五年计划的基本建设任务不倦地奋斗着。伟大的工业建设计划需要各种各样的建筑材料，其中尤以水泥的供应更为迫切。根据苏联先进经验，使水泥能够满足建设需要的办法有两种：一是将水泥品种增多，生产多种多样多标号的水泥，以供应各种不同性质建筑的需要，一是由国家从严规定高级标号水泥的使用范围，并制定使用水泥的特种规程，使在建筑中能经济地、合理地使用各种各样的水泥。这首先要求水泥的生产部门迅速地从事水泥品种的研究，根据国家各种不同建筑的需要，进行多种多样水泥的生产，其次要求使用部分按工程性质的不同，采用各种各样的水泥，以达到在保证工程质量的条件下，降低工程成本，大量节省国家基本建设的投资和节省国家资源。
    先进的苏联水泥工业，在十月革命胜利以后，即开始多品种、多标号水泥的生产。经过几十年来的不断改进与扩大，现在已有五十种以上的水泥名称。但在革命前的俄国，只有三种水泥，其强度仅相当于今天的中级标号水泥。比今天的高级标号水泥强度低了一倍，也就是说，苏联现在的水泥质量比过去提高了一倍以上。
    苏联的水泥，在经过几十年的研究改进之后，已获得高度的技术成就。除了高级标号水泥的质量不断提高外，还进行了低级标号水泥的大量生产，其生产比重和高级标号水泥是并驾齐驱的。例如六○○号、五○○号、四○○号的高级标号水泥，仅占生产总量的百分之五十；其余一半则是中级标号与低级标号的水泥。经验证明：在实际建筑中，有许多地方使用其他种类的水泥反而比矽酸盐水泥（即不掺加混合材料的纯水泥）好，其制造成本也比矽酸盐水泥低，而且在有些工程上采用高级标号水泥，不仅造成工程成本上的浪费，反而降低了工程质量。拿水利工程来说，采用高级标号的矽酸盐水泥反会破坏了水利建筑，所以苏联在水利工程上有明文规定，不得使用未掺水硬性混合材料的矽酸盐水泥。
    苏联先进经验也证明了：水泥工业的发展，必须是由三方面来进行。就是说，除了水泥工业工作者的努力外，还必须有建筑者的密切合作，科学研究机关与试验部门的重视和互相推动，否则多品种、多标号水泥的推广会遇到各种阻碍而不易实现。
    一、学习苏联先进经验，扩大水泥品种，满足建设需要
    我国水泥工业，一向是采用英美资本主义国家的技术方法从事生产的。一九五○年，在苏联水泥专家的帮助下，开始学习苏联先进经验，并经过两年的试验与试制过程，到一九五二年始正式转入大量生产。在过去我们只生产一种标号的水泥，即二十八天耐压强度标准规定为一五○公斤，实际生产为二二○公斤以上的矽酸盐水泥（指日本规格软练法，合硬练约为三○○多号）。虽然规定的标号为二○○多号（即一五○公斤）而实际上各厂为了便于推销，不仅一般都提高到五○○号以上，而且还强调英美资本主义国家的标准规格，反对掺加任何混合材料。这一现象首先在一九五二年由东北各水泥厂开始纠正，打破了旧的技术观点，开始走向苏联多品种多标号水泥的道路。把水泥的生产分类为五种：即普通水泥、高炉水泥、页岩水泥、砂岩水泥、垆坍水泥；水泥的等级也分为五个标号，即六○○号、五○○号、四○○号、三○○号、二○○号。经过采集试验的混合材料共二十三种。这些混合材料都是制造水泥的优良材料，只要建筑上需要即可进行正式生产。在品种方面，油井水泥已开始根据需要者的订货进行生产，其他如防水、耐酸等水泥也正在研究中。
    由于学习了苏联先进经验，从事多品种多标号水泥生产的结果，一九五二年东北水泥的产量，在原有厂矿不添加任何设备的条件下，超计划地增产了百分之二十五以上，而成本则降低了百分之十左右，相当于增加了一个中等水泥厂的年产量。自一九五二年十一月全国水泥技术会议召开之后，不论国营水泥厂、公私合营水泥厂或私营水泥厂均在积极搜集混合材料进行试验分析，准备大量生产多品种、多标号的水泥，以供应国家建设的需要。
    学习苏联先进经验，生产多品种、多标号水泥，不仅可以增加产量，而且在水泥质量上也有显著的提高。首先由于对各种不同性质的工程采用不同标号的水泥已有了科学的保证，因而开始克服了滥用高级标号水泥的现象。例如在过去只生产一个标号（即二十八天耐压强度标准规定为一五○公斤，实际生产为二二○公斤以上）的水泥，任何工程都以此种水泥施工，以这样高级标号的水泥使用于砌砖、抹墙、抹缝上显然是很大的浪费。特别是如水利发电的大型堰堤，不仅由于这种纯水泥的水化热高，易起崩坏作用，更严重的是由于纯水泥缺乏对淡水的抵抗性，受到水的侵蚀后有逐渐走向崩溃的危险。相反地，掺混合材水泥由于掺加了具有防蚀等特殊性能的材料，就完全避免了这些外侵的危险。这是掺混合材水泥品质优越的具体表现。
    二、掺混合材水泥在实际施工中发挥了优越性能
    新产品水泥的进行，得到了研究部门、试验部门以及施工部门的协助，并得到上级的支持。在一九五二年前东北工业部颁布使用掺混合材水泥的决定以后，平衡部门即根据各部门工程性质的需要，分配了各种水泥，并印发了“水泥、胶泥、混凝土”一书（摘译自苏联建筑师手册），作为施工技术上的指导。这一措施曾收到很大的效果。根据我们组织专门小组深入各大施工部门检查新品种水泥的质量所得，我们认为鞍山钢铁公司是一个使用掺混合材水泥很好的典型。该公司不仅有比较完整的试验设备，而且在使用水泥时，切实地按照苏联先进经验作到合理的配合比。虽然鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂两工程在开始使用掺混合材水泥时表示怀疑，把混凝土配制提高一级，但经过半年来现场试验的结果，证明这种提高是一种浪费，今年并已提出了纠正。据鞍钢负责工地施工的同志表示：在具备了机械搅拌、有试验室执行检验制度和控制质量、以及执行操作规程这三个条件下，不应提高混凝土标号。该公司混凝土试验记录说明，使用现行标号水泥，按照“水泥、胶泥、混凝土”一书中介绍的配合比，可以达到预期的混凝土标号。这样便间接地证明了，现行水泥标号与苏联水泥标号是一致的。鞍山钢铁公司所以获得这一成绩，主要是他们能研究和掌握掺混合材水泥的特性，订出了操作规程贯彻到工人中去，并利用了掺混合材水泥凝固较慢的特性，解决了夏季施工问题，充分发挥了掺混合材水泥的优越性。
    以上事实使我们认识到：使用掺混合材水泥首先必须研究其特殊性能，并在施工中做到切实根据苏联的先进使用方法，才能充分发挥掺混合材水泥的优越性。拿水泥的干缩裂缝问题来说，按苏联规定必须提早加强养护，掺混合材水泥的混凝土最少养护十四天。重工业部直属工程公司技术人员认识了干缩的特性，采用提早覆盖加强养护的办法，在一万平方公尺的建筑中完全防止了裂缝现象，连初期已裂缝的楼板，也因加强了养护而使裂纹消失；提高了工人对使用掺混合材水泥的信心。另外，因掺混合材水泥凝结较慢，这是大家最不满意的一件事，但鞍钢大型工地利用这一特性，解决了夏季施工在较长的运输距离和较大的面积上所引起的上下层结合问题。
    三、必须克服思想障碍，规定使用规程，消灭浪费现象
    两年来在推广苏联先进经验，生产多品种、多标号水泥的过程中，由于我们主观努力不够，曾造成了工作上的许多困难。其中主要的缺点是对新品种水泥的宣传不够，未能充分地把掺混合材水泥的特性与优缺点及时进行宣传，使大家能很快认识到在使用时所应注意的问题。同时在生产技术尚未达到熟练的情况下，在质量的控制上跳动性很大；在变更混合材料时未能及时通知使用部门予以注意，以便在操作上加以控制，因而引起了使用部门的怀疑与不满，甚或造成施工上不必要的损失，这是值得我们深刻检讨的问题。但另一方面，由于各种思想障碍的存在，也增加了掺混合材水泥推广的困难。首先是我们的某些技术人员，在开始制造水泥时，大部分习惯于英美资本主义国家的水泥技术理论，在学习苏联先进水泥技术方法上表示了怀疑甚至采取对抗的态度，而在施工技术人员方面，则遇到了严重的保守思想。他们习惯于使用单一品种，单一标号的水泥，因而就认为苏联多品种、多标号水泥在使用上太麻烦，对低级标号水泥则认为是粗制滥造，拒绝使用。根据我们调查一九五二年各工程部门使用水泥的情况，有的部门由于大多数技术人员对掺混合材水泥抱有成见，就把设计需要一一○号的混凝土，施工时却按一四○号来配制，浪费了百分之十二到十五的水泥；甚至有的施工单位提高两级，按一七○号配制，把四○○号水泥当三○○号使用，浪费的水泥约在百分之十五左右；更严重的情况是把二○○号水泥当白灰使用，不研究水泥性能、不注意操作规程，一旦工程发生问题时，又不深入研究，就把原因全部推到掺混合材水泥身上，这是较为普遍的现象。据东北煤建公司反映：一般用户（主要指国营企业）要求最好是五○○号水泥，其次是四○○号普通水泥，否则便要四○○号掺混合材水泥，不得已时才要三○○与二○○号水泥；有的则表示上级分配下来的不得不要。这一情况说明了还有不少使用单位对掺混合材水泥存在着不正确的看法，从而阻碍着掺混合材水泥的扩大使用。
    四、生产、使用等部门必须密切配合，为增加水泥品种共同努力
    综上所述情况，说明我国水泥工业在学习苏联先进经验进行生产改革之后，不仅产量提高、质量改善，保证了在国家工业恢复改建时期的水泥供应，并且还为今后有计划经济建设的供应打下了基础，为今后生产者与使用者开辟了广阔的道路。由于在实践过程中达到了保证工程质量和降低工程成本的要求，进一步扩大新品种和低级标号水泥的生产，争取逐步改善现有的高级标号水泥占总产量百分之八十以上的情况，是完全必要与可能的。关键在于必须继续学习苏联先进经验，提高生产技术与使用水泥的技术水平，并使生产者、使用者以及研究部门三者密切配合起来，共同为保证供应产量多、质量好、成本低的新品种水泥而努力。
