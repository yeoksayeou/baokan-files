Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 22nd: The United States is not only manipulating raw material prices and implementing "embargo" policies, causing Indonesia's economic situation to continuously deteriorate, but is also attempting to further interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs, which has aroused new dissatisfaction in Indonesia.

In recent days, dispatches from London by American and British bourgeois news agencies have revealed that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will "express concern" about the situation in Indonesia at the upcoming U.S., British, and French Bermuda Conference. United Press International also said that Dulles has suggested including the Indonesian issue on the provisional agenda of the Bermuda Conference. According to Reuters, Dulles's main "concern" is that the Indonesian government, unable to endure the severe economic difficulties caused by the U.S. manipulation of rubber prices, has sent a trade delegation to seek new markets.

This arrogant attitude of the United States attempting to openly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs has immediately aroused indignation among Indonesian politicians and in public opinion circles. According to a report by the Indonesian Antara News Agency on November 21, Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Wongsonigoro accused the U.S. conspiracy of aiming to "lower Indonesia's international reputation." Anita News Agency reported on the same day that Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Sidik pointed out that U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs is an attempt to "pull Indonesia to their side." Asrarudin, spokesman for the Labor Party's parliamentary group, said that foreigners should not interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. He said that if the Bermuda Conference discusses the Indonesian issue, it would constitute interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The "Independent Daily" also published an editorial saying that resolving the Indonesian issue is a matter for the Indonesian people. Indonesians know how to use the best methods to solve their own problems.

    美国公开表示要干涉印尼内政
    印尼政界人士非常愤慨
    【新华社二十二日讯】雅加达消息：美国不但实行操纵原料价格和“禁运”政策使印尼经济情况不断恶化，而且还企图进一步干涉印尼内政，这已在印尼引起新的不满。
    最近几天来，美英资产阶级通讯社从伦敦发出的电讯都透露，美国国务卿杜勒斯将在即将举行的美、英、法三国百慕大会议上，对印尼的情况“表示关切”。合众社并说，杜勒斯已经建议把印尼问题列入百慕大会议的临时议程。据路透社透露，杜勒斯所“关切”的主要事情，就是印尼政府由于不能忍受美国操纵橡胶价格政策所造成的严重经济困难而派遣贸易代表团去寻找新的市场。
    美国这种企图公然干涉印尼内政的狂妄态度，立即引起印尼政界人士和舆论界的愤慨。据印尼安塔拉通讯社二十一日报道，印尼第一副总理旺梭尼哥罗指责美国阴谋的目的是为了要“降低印尼的国际声誉”。安尼塔通讯社同一天报道，印尼国民党主席西迪克指出，美国干涉印尼内政是为了企图“把印尼拉到它们的一边去”。劳工党议会党团发言人阿斯拉鲁丁说，外国人不应该干涉印尼的内政。他说，如果百慕大会议讨论印尼问题，那就是干涉印尼内政。
    “独立报”也发表社论说，解决印尼问题是印尼人的事情。印尼人知道用最好的办法来解决自己的问题。
