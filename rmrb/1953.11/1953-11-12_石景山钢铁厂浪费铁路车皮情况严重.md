    Serious Waste of Railway Wagons at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    A letter from Zhao Hongzhang of Shijingshan Railway Station: The serious waste of railway wagons at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has not been improved for a long time. According to the agreement signed by the Tianjin Railway Administration (my station was originally under its leadership) and the factory last year, the maximum time a freight car could stay at the factory was six hours. However, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant frequently violates this agreement. According to statistics, during the seven months from June to December last year, freight cars exceeded the allotted time by 57,119 hours, equivalent to 2,380 wagons being held up for a day. When our station, in accordance with railway regulations, assessed the factory a late fee of 1.2 billion yuan for the delayed wagons, the factory's transportation department refused to pay, and the problem remains unresolved. Currently, this phenomenon of wasting wagons is still serious. According to our statistics, the factory wasted more than 29,500 wagon hours of railway transport capacity in the three months of July, August, and September this year. What is particularly serious is that the factory actually uses railway wagons as material storage warehouses. The factory has many unloading yards, but in order to save internal handling capacity, it stipulates that the coal transported should be unloaded directly at the various material usage locations. Therefore, what could have been unloaded at once is now unloaded in several times. This item alone wastes more than 2,000 wagon hours per month. For example, since late September, the factory has reduced the scope of use of the unloading yards, and three lines that could unload 72 wagons have been stopped, resulting in the ore transported from Pangjiabao having to be unloaded in several times on one line. This wastes more than 1,000 wagon hours per month.
    In order to determine the standard time for freight cars staying at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Central Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Administration, together with the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Iron and Steel Industry Administration and other units, conducted a key standard investigation at the factory in March this year. According to the investigation results, the standard time for freight cars to stay at the factory should be 4.8 hours. However, the factory's transportation department, on the pretext that the trial standard has not yet been carried out, refuses to implement the new standard, which has delayed the signing of the factory's 1953 railway transportation contract.
    The staff of our station have many opinions on the factory's failure to pay attention to the rational use of wagons. Some people reflect: "We are sweating profusely, striving to shorten the stopping time by every second, but the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant wastes a lot of wagons."
    Editor's note: Recently, we have also received letters from Fu Xuechao of Xincheng Station of the Taiyuan Railway Administration and Hou Mingyi of the Zhangjiakou Railway Transportation Sub-bureau, reflecting that the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Second Branch of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine also have the problem of extending the stopping time of freight cars and wasting railway transport capacity. This shows that this problem is not an isolated phenomenon and should be given widespread attention.
    Railway transportation is the country's main transportation force. At present, railway transport capacity is not surplus, but cannot keep up with the needs of the task. Therefore, how to strengthen the planning of railway transportation and improve vehicle turnover speed and transport capacity is not only an important task for the country in developing the transportation industry, but also has a direct impact on the country's economic development, expansion of material exchanges between urban and rural areas, and support for basic construction. However, to do this work well, in addition to requiring the people's railway enterprises themselves to make the greatest efforts to strengthen enterprise management, it must also obtain the strong cooperation of the relevant departments. The relevant departments should attach importance to the relevance of social production, strengthen the overall view, and while considering and organizing the production of their own enterprises, they should also consider how to plan to fully utilize and rationally use transportation forces, and respect the regulations of the people's railways, so that the people's railway enterprises can quickly strengthen planned transportation, improve transport capacity, and reduce transport costs.
    In order to effectively improve the serious situation of wasting railway transport capacity, it is hoped that the above-mentioned three units will conduct an in-depth inspection of this issue based on the opinions raised by readers of this newspaper and propose effective improvement measures.

### 石景山钢铁厂浪费铁路车皮情况严重

专栏：读者来信摘要

    石景山钢铁厂浪费铁路车皮情况严重
    石景山车站赵鸿章来信：石景山钢铁厂严重浪费铁路车皮的情况长期没有改进。根据去年天津铁路管理局（我站原属该局领导）和厂方签订协议书的规定，在去年六月至十二月的期间，每次货车停厂时间最多不得超过六小时。但是石景山钢铁厂经常违反协议。据统计，在这七个月内，货车超过停留时间达五万七千一百十九小时，等于二千三百八十个车皮被积压了一天。当我站依据铁路规章，向该厂核收货车延期罚款十二亿元时，该厂运输部竟拒绝缴纳，问题拖到现在仍未解决。目前，这种浪费车皮的现象仍然是严重的。据我们统计：在今年七、八、九三个月内，该厂浪费铁路运输力即达二万九千五百余车小时。尤其严重的是该厂竟把铁路车皮当作存料仓库使用。该厂的卸货场很多，但为了节省厂内搬运力，竟规定把运来的煤直接卸到各个用料场所，因此本来可以一次卸车的，现在得分数次卸车，仅此一项，每月所浪费的车皮就超过二千个车小时。又如，该厂自九月下旬起缩小卸货场的使用范围，有三条可卸七十二个车皮的线路被停止使用，以致造成庞家堡运来的矿石不得不集中在一条线上分数次卸车，这样每个月车皮的浪费也在一千个车小时以上。
    为了查定石景山钢铁厂货车停厂的标准时间，中央铁道部和北京铁路管理局曾于今年三月会同中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局等单位深入该厂进行重点查标工作。根据查定结果，货车停厂的标准时间应为四点八小时。但该厂运输部竟借口尚未试标等原因，不肯执行新标准，以致使该厂一九五三年度的铁路运输合同迟迟不能签订。
    我站职工对该厂不注意合理使用车皮很有意见。有人反映：“我们忙得满头大汗，争取停车时间一分一秒钟地缩短，然而石景山钢铁厂却浪费了大量的车皮。”
    编者按：最近我们又收到太原铁路管理局新城站傅学超、张家口铁路运输分局侯明义等来信，反映太原钢铁厂、宣化龙烟铁矿二分矿同样也有延长货车停厂时间、浪费铁路运输力的情况。这就说明这个问题已经不是个别现象，应该引起普遍的重视。
    铁路运输是国家的主要运输力量。目前，铁路运输力量不是过剩，而是赶不上任务的需要。因此，如何加强铁路运输的计划性，提高车辆周转速度和运输力的问题，就不仅是国家在发展交通运输事业中的重要工作，同时对国家发展经济、扩大城乡内外物资交流和支援基本建设都有着直接的影响。但做好这项工作，除要求人民铁道企业本身应作最大的努力，加强企业管理外，还必须取得各有关部门的有力配合。各有关部门应该重视社会生产的联系性，加强全局观点，在考虑和组织本企业生产的同时，也应该考虑到如何有计划地充分发挥和合理利用运输力量，尊重人民铁路的规章，以便人民铁道企业可以迅速地加强计划运输，提高运输力，减低运输成本。
    为了切实改进浪费铁路运输力的严重情况，希望上述三个单位根据本报读者所提出的意见，对这个问题作深入检查，并提出有效的改进办法。
