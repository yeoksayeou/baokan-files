Editor's Note: This is the opening speech made by Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, at the opening ceremony of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, originally titled "Mobilize All Members, Unite Private Industrialists and Businessmen under the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and Strive to Implement the General Line of the State During the Transition Period!"

Comrades, Guests:

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association is now open.

First, we would like to extend our highest respect to the great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, who are leading us to victory!

Today, we are honored to have representatives from the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various friendly parties, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the United Front Work Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party present to guide us. We would like to express our warm welcome and gratitude!

This meeting is another grand gathering after the Second Enlarged Meeting of the General Assembly of our association. Most of the members of the General Assembly are present, and responsible comrades from our local organizations are also attending as observers. At today's opening ceremony, members of our association attending the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and members of the Beijing branch are also participating. Everyone feels very happy to be gathered together.

At this meeting, we have an extremely important issue to discuss and decide, which is the issue of the future direction and tasks of our association. Over the past four years, our national economy has been restored and developed, and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victory. Starting this year, our country has entered a period of planned national economic construction, and the general line of the transition period has been clearly announced to the people of the whole country, and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan have been specifically put forward. Under this great goal, what should be the future direction and tasks of our association, and how should we implement and complete them? This is what we need to solemnly discuss and properly decide at this meeting. This is the central requirement of our meeting. To this end, we must all work hard to review the work of our association from the Second Enlarged Meeting of the General Assembly in July 1952 to the present, clarify the future direction and tasks, and stipulate the ways to implement and complete them, so that the work of our association can meet the needs of the great situation of the country.

In addition, this meeting will also discuss the issue of the National Congress of our association. The timing of the congress, how the representatives will be elected, and how to start preparations need to be well decided in principle at this meeting.

In short, this meeting is an extremely important meeting for our association. I believe that due to the enthusiasm and efforts of the comrades, we will definitely be able to reach a consensus and satisfactory conclusion on the future direction and tasks of our association and other issues after full discussion.

Comrades! Our meeting is held under the new situation in which our country has achieved great victories on all fronts, has entered a period of planned national economic construction, has clearly announced the general line of the transition period to the people of the whole country, and has specifically put forward the basic tasks of the first five-year plan.

Regarding the general line of the transition period, Chairman Mao gave the following instructions: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of the socialist transformation, this is a transition period. The general line and general task of this transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicraft industry, and private industry and commerce over a considerable period of time. This general line is the lighthouse illuminating our various tasks. Leaving it will lead to right-leaning or left-leaning errors."

According to Chairman Mao's instructions, we should have the following basic understanding of the state's general line during the transition period:

(1) The state's transition period begins on the day the People's Republic of China was founded and will end when the socialist transformation is basically completed. In terms of the nature of the Chinese revolution, from the time when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism over the Chinese people and established the People's Democratic Dictatorship of the People's Republic of China, our stage of the New Democratic Revolution has ended and we have entered a stage of gradually transitioning to a socialist society. This stage is a transition period. The New Democratic society in which we are currently located is precisely this transitional society, and its inevitable and only result of forward development is to steadily move towards a socialist society.

(2) The general line and general task of the transition period have two aspects: one is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country; the other is to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicraft industry, and private industry and commerce. These two aspects are inseparable. Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his speech at the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce: "Socialist industrialization is the material foundation and leading force for the gradual completion of the country's socialist transformation, while the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and private industry and commerce can promote the development of the country's socialist industrialization." From Li's remarks, we should recognize that as long as private industrialists and businessmen sincerely accept socialist transformation, they are contributing to the implementation of the state's general line.

(3) The goal of the Chinese revolution is to establish a socialist society, so our country must resolutely implement this general line of the transition period. We cannot and should not take the capitalist road. Now, in our country, the leading position of the socialist economic component has been consolidated, its proportion is steadily increasing, and the non-socialist economic component is being gradually transformed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country are actively working to implement the general line, and will eventually build the country into a great socialist country.

(4) The Chinese national bourgeoisie has two sides: a negative side and a positive side. They were oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past, so some of their representatives participated in or sympathized with the people's liberation struggle to a certain extent during a certain period. After the national liberation, the Chinese national bourgeoisie accepted the leadership of the working class, participated in the people's power, and played a certain positive role in supplying products, helping material exchanges, accumulating funds for the country, and cultivating technical and management talents for the country in business operations. This is where the Chinese national bourgeoisie differs from the bourgeoisie of capitalist countries, and it is also a characteristic of the national bourgeoisie under special historical conditions in China. Moreover, after continuous education and transformation in recent years, especially after the "Five-Anti" movement, their corrupt and profit-seeking side has been criticized and struggled against, so their positive side has been more fully developed. In the future, as long as they continue to work hard consciously under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they will be able to accept the state's gradual socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

(5) The transition period needs to go through a considerably long period of time. The country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation must be gradually realized; that is to say, we should move forward steadily. Hasty advance is wrong, and stagnation is also wrong. The length of this period mainly depends on the efforts and achievements made by the people of the whole country to implement the state's general line. Private industrialists and businessmen who recognize this should take a warmly supportive attitude and actively work to create conditions for accepting the state's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

(6) The general line instructed by Chairman Mao is a lighthouse illuminating the people of the whole country to move forward. Actively working to implement this general line can smoothly and steadily transition to a socialist society. This is the greatest and long-term interest of the people of the whole country, and it is the only bright and happy road for the people of the whole country. It must be pointed out that state capitalism is the necessary path for capitalist industry and commerce to gradually complete socialist transformation. Facts in recent years have proved that many private capitalist enterprises have embarked on the road of state capitalism, the relations of production have gradually changed, and they can completely or largely overcome the difficulties that ordinary private capitalist enterprises cannot overcome, so that the productive forces gradually develop, the enterprises are gradually transformed, and individuals are gradually transformed. Therefore, through the road of state capitalism, gradually implementing socialist transformation, private industry and commerce can correctly play a positive role and become a useful part of the country's great construction. This prospect is the real bright future for private industrialists and businessmen.

According to this general line, the Central People's Government Committee has decided on the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, which are: "Concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry, establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization; correspondingly train construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; systematically promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicraft industry, continue to transform private industry and commerce, correctly play the role of individual agriculture, handicraft industry, and private industry and commerce; ensure that the proportion of socialist components in the national economy steadily increases, and ensure that the material and cultural living standards of the people are gradually improved on the basis of developing production."

It is clear from this that the tasks of private industry and commerce during the transition period and the first five-year plan are to continue to accept socialist transformation and correctly play their role. Regarding the current specific practices, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also made a clear appeal in the slogans celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in which the appeal to industrialists in private enterprises is: "Under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, strive to operate enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood! Abide by the Common Program, oppose shoddy work and tax evasion, accept the supervision of the working masses, actively improve business management, and gradually embark on the path of state capitalism and state planning!"

The appeal to merchants is: "Improve management, obey market management, oppose speculative purchases and tax evasion, develop material exchanges between urban and rural areas under the leadership of state-owned commerce, and do a good job in the consignment and purchasing work entrusted by the state!" This shows the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce. This is entirely in line with the requirements of the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period. Therefore, private industrialists and businessmen must first of all love the country and abide by the law, eliminate the "five evils," improve production and operation, carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy under the leadership of the People's Government, and strive to make their enterprises gradually embark on the path of state capitalism and state planning.

Regarding the direction, policies and future efforts and future prospects of the private industrial and commercial enterprises under the provisions of the general line in the transitional period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, Li Weihan, Deputy Director, had extremely detailed instructions in his speech at the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Comrades should carefully and thoroughly study them.

Comrades! In the efforts made by the people of the whole country to implement the state's general line, we must first of all require all members to mobilize, fully recognize the important political significance of implementing the state's general line during the transition period ideologically, and actively invest in this great cause in action. Members who are industrialists and businessmen must especially ensure that they do not violate the state's general line in all economic activities in the future. This means that in the future, we must use our own practical actions to express our loyalty to the state's general line.

Li Weihan, Deputy Director, pointed out in his speech at the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce: "We are very pleased to see that in recent years, a group of advanced elements have emerged in the industrial and commercial circles. They have a long-term vision, can see the future of the country and the direction of the industrial and commercial circles, they rely on the Communist Party and the People's Government, love the country and abide by the law, actively improve production and operation, and maintain considerable contact and belief among industrialists and businessmen. We hope that through the work of this congress, and through the efforts of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, such advanced elements will be gradually cultivated from industrialists and businessmen of large, medium, and small households in various places and industries, and become the backbone for uniting and educating the vast number of industrialists and businessmen. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, I firmly believe that this hope can definitely become a reality." Li's remarks gave us the correct enlightenment.

In order to adapt to the requirements of the state's general line, the future work policy and central tasks of our association are: through the transformation of private industry and commerce, the increase of production and frugality and various patriotic movements, relying on the efforts of all members, to cultivate and improve the members of our association who are industrialists and businessmen to become backbone elements in industry and commerce, that is, to make them first of all truly love the country and abide by the law, actively improve production and operation, study hard, earnestly accept socialist transformation, loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and closely contact and unite the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, correctly play the leading, exemplary, and bridging role between the People's Government and the industrial and commercial circles, and strive to implement the state's general line during the transition period.

Members of our association who are industrialists and businessmen should recognize that it is their important responsibility to complete the above-mentioned central tasks. Therefore, the association requires members who are industrialists and businessmen to strive to meet the following conditions under the association's training and education:

First, love the country and abide by the law. This is the most basic, most important, and most fundamental condition for members. Without this condition, there is no point in talking about accepting socialist transformation. This is to strengthen the idea of patriotism, draw a clear line between abiding by the law and violating the law, and strictly abide by policies and laws in action, especially in economic activities, thoroughly eliminate the "five evils," and oppose tax evasion, shoddy work, speculative purchases, and all bad business practices. Members of our association must play a leading and backbone role in the industrial and commercial circles. First of all, they must regard any illegal act, no matter how slight, as a shameful thing and resolutely eliminate it. In recent years, members of our association have generally made progress in their ideological understanding to varying degrees, but judging from the facts that have been discovered by local organizations recently, some members who are industrialists and businessmen have loved the country and abided by the law, while a considerable number of people have committed errors or illegal acts to varying degrees. This shows that to truly love the country and abide by the law, it is necessary to conduct serious education and supervision. In the future, all of our members must strive to eliminate the illegal acts of members, and we hope that members who love the country and abide by the law will consolidate their style and expand their influence.

Second, actively improve production and operation. Members are required to obey the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, take it as an honor to be utilized by the state and the people, actively operate businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and start from their own enterprises, using correct thinking and exemplary actions to promote private industrialists and businessmen to give play to the enthusiasm for production and operation, launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and implement democratic management of enterprises.

Third, study hard. Members are required to study hard the state's general line, the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, the Common Program, policies, laws and regulations, and the "Five-Anti" principles, and pay attention to linking theory with practice, combine study with economic activities, launch criticism and self-criticism, achieve consistency between words and deeds, and play an active role in the industrial and commercial circles.

Fourth, accept socialist transformation. Members are required to recognize the significance of socialist transformation, take a positive and supportive attitude towards gradually realizing socialist transformation through the path of state capitalism, oppose passive waiting thinking and behavior, strive to put their enterprises on the track of state capitalism according to the needs and plans of the state, and continuously transform themselves in the process of enterprise transformation.

Fifth, loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. Members are required to have a long-term vision, recognize that gradually transitioning to a socialist society is the great future of the country, accepting socialist transformation through state capitalism is the bright road for the industrial and commercial circles, combine their own future with the future of the country, subordinate individual interests to national interests, closely connect with the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, and always unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and strive to complete the socialist transformation.

Members of our association who are not industrialists and businessmen should strive to complete state tasks, abide by state discipline, strengthen learning, continuously transform themselves, improve their theoretical and policy level and professional level; and under the requirements of the work policy and central tasks of our association, understand the basic spirit of the above five conditions, recognize their important responsibilities, continue to actively play a role, closely unite and cooperate with members of our association who are industrialists and businessmen, implement mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual assistance, and mutual education in learning and work, and work together to implement the state's general line during the transition period.

This is the requirement put forward by our association to all members in order to implement the future work policy and central tasks. Every member should consciously obey the organization, abide by discipline, and seriously and earnestly implement the above requirements. It should be pointed out that the association's help to members in the past was not enough. From the "Five-Anti" movement to the present, the leading and backbone role played by members of our association in the industrial and commercial circles is worth mentioning, but it is still very limited. Now the state has clearly announced the general line of the transition period to the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class are actively working to realize this great goal. Under this situation, the tasks of our association in the future are even more important. We should not be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we should not ignore our shortcomings. We must concentrate our efforts within a period of time, according to the work policy and central tasks decided by this meeting, to help the existing members correct their shortcomings and strive to improve, so that they can become truly effective backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles. In this way, we can contribute our strength to the implementation of the state's general line. Therefore, in the future, all levels of organizations of our association should vigorously consolidate and improve on the existing basis; specifically for each member, they must also consolidate their existing achievements, earnestly overcome their shortcomings, and strive for further improvement, in order to meet the above requirements.

Comrades! Let us actively participate in the national construction work under the banner of the glorious Mao Zedong Thought, and forge ahead courageously to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, to implement the general line of our country during the transition period and to complete the basic tasks of the first five-year plan!

    在中国民主建国会总会委员会全体会议上
    黄炎培主任委员的开幕词
    编者按：这是中国民主建国会黄炎培主任委员在中国民主建国会总会委员会全体会议开幕式上所作的开幕词，原题为“全体会员，动员起来，在中国共产党的领导下，团结私营工商业者，为贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线而奋斗！”各位同志，各位来宾：
    中国民主建国会总会委员会全体会议现在开幕了。
    首先，我们要向领导我们胜利前进的伟大的、正确的、光荣的中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席谨致最崇高的敬礼！
    今天我们很荣幸地得到中国共产党中央统战部、各友党、中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会和中国共产党中央华北局统战部的各位代表光临指导，我们要表示热烈的欢迎和感谢！
    我们这次会议是本会第二次总会扩大会议以后又一次的盛会，大部分总会委员都出席了，还有我们各地方组织的负责同志列席。今天的开幕式，又有出席中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会的本会会员和北京市分会的委员参加，济济一堂，大家都感到很愉快。
    在这次会议上，我们有一个极其重大的问题要讨论决定，就是关于本会今后方针、任务的问题。四年来，我国的国民经济已获得恢复和发展，抗美援朝的斗争已取得伟大的胜利。从今年起，我们国家并已进入到一个有计划的国民经济建设时期，同时向全国人民明确地宣布了过渡时期的总路线，并且具体地提出了第一个五年计划的基本任务。在这个伟大的目标之下，本会今后的方针、任务是什么，我们又如何来贯彻完成，是需要我们在这次会议上郑重地讨论并妥善地作出决定的。这就是我们这次会议的中心要求。为此，我们必须大家努力，检查本会从一九五二年七月第二次总会扩大会议到最近的工作，明确今后的方针、任务，并规定贯彻完成的途径，使本会的工作能够适应国家的伟大形势的需要。
    此外，这次会议还要讨论本会全国代表大会的问题。关于代表大会召开的时间，代表如何产生，以及如何着手进行筹备等问题，都需要我们在这次会议上很好地作出原则的决定。
    总之，这次会议是本会的极为重要的一次会议。我相信，由于同志们对会的热心和努力，我们一定能在充分讨论之后，对本会今后的方针、任务问题以及其他问题，取得一致的认识和圆满的结论。一
    同志们！我们这次会议是在我们国家取得了各个战线上的伟大胜利，已经进入了一个有计划的国民经济建设时期，向全国人民明确地宣布了过渡时期总路线并具体地提出了第一个五年计划基本任务的新形势下举行的。
    关于过渡时期的总路线，毛主席作了如下的指示：“从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。这条总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔，各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或左倾的错误。”
      根据毛主席这个指示，我们对于国家过渡时期的总路线应该有下面几点基本的认识：
    （一）国家的过渡时期，开始于中华人民共和国成立之日，将终了于社会主义改造基本完成之时。就中国革命的性质来说，从中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义对中国人民的统治、建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国的时候起，我们的新民主主义革命阶段就已经完结，而开始进入一个逐步过渡到社会主义社会的阶段。这个阶段，是一个过渡时期。我们现在所处的新民主主义社会正是这个过渡性质的社会，其向前发展的必然的、唯一的结果，就是稳步地走到社会主义社会。
    （二）过渡时期的总路线和总任务有两个方面：一是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化；一是逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。这两个方面是不可分离的。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会李维汉副主任在中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会上的讲话中指出：“社会主义工业化是逐步完成国家的社会主义改造的物质基础和领导力量，而农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造又能促进国家的社会主义工业化的发展。”从李副主任这段话中，我们应该认识到，私营工商业者只要真心诚意地接受社会主义的改造，就是对于贯彻国家总路线有了贡献。
    （三）中国革命的目标，是建立社会主义社会，所以我们的国家必须坚决地贯彻这个过渡时期的总路线。我们不可能也不应该走资本主义的道路。现在，我们国家中，社会主义经济成分的领导地位已经巩固，它的比重正在稳步增长，非社会主义经济成分正在逐步被改造。在中国共产党的领导下，全国人民为贯彻总路线而积极努力，最后就会水到渠成地把国家建立成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    （四）中国民族资产阶级是有两面性的，有消极的一面，也有积极的一面。他们过去受到帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，因此他们中间一部分代表人物，在一定时期、一定程度上，参加过或同情过人民解放斗争。全国解放以后，中国民族资产阶级接受了工人阶级的领导，参加了人民政权，在供应产品、帮助物资交流、为国家积累资金、在企业经营中为国家培养技术的和管理的人材等方面，发挥了一定的积极作用。这是中国民族资产阶级不同于资本主义国家资产阶级的地方，也是在中国特殊的历史条件下民族资产阶级的特点。并且，他们这几年来经过不断的教育和改造，特别是“五反”运动以后，其唯利是图的腐朽的一面，受到了批判和斗争，因而积极的一面，有了较多的发挥。今后，只要他们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，不断地、自觉地努力，他们是能够接受国家对私营工商业所逐步进行的社会主义改造的。
    （五）过渡时期需要经历一个相当长的时期。国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造必须逐步实现；这就是说，我们应当稳步前进，急躁冒进是不对的，停滞不进也是不对的。这个时期的长短，主要要看全国人民为贯彻国家总路线所作的努力及其成就而决定。私营工商业者认识了这一点，就应该以热诚拥护的态度，积极努力，为接受国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造而创造条件。
    （六）毛主席指示的总路线是照耀着全国人民前进的灯塔。为贯彻这条总路线而积极努力，就可以顺利地稳步地过渡到社会主义社会。这是全国人民最大的和长远的利益，是全国人民唯一的光明幸福的大道。必须指出，国家资本主义是资本主义工商业逐步完成社会主义改造的必经之路。几年来的事实证明，许多私人资本主义企业走上了国家资本主义的道路，生产关系逐渐有所改变，就能全部或大部克服一般私人资本主义企业所不能克服的困难，使生产力逐渐发展，企业逐步得到改造，个人也逐步得到改造。所以，经过国家资本主义的道路，逐步实行社会主义改造，私营工商业便能正确地发挥积极的作用，成为国家的伟大建设中的一个有用的部分。这个前途是私营工商业者真正的光明前途。
    根据这条总路线，中央人民政府委员会已决定了第一个五年计划的基本任务，这就是：“集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对私营工商业的改造，正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成分的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。”
    由此可见，私营工商业在过渡时期和第一个五年计划中的任务是继续接受社会主义的改造并正确地发挥其作用。关于当前的具体做法，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年口号中又作了明确的号召，其中对于私营企业中的工业家的号召是：“在人民政府和国营经济的领导下，努力经营有利于国计民生的企业！遵守共同纲领，反对偷工减料和偷税漏税，接受工人群众的监督积极改善经营管理，逐步走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道！”
    对于商人的号召是：“改善经营，服从市场管理，反对投机套购和偷税漏税行为，在国营商业的领导下，开展城乡物资交流，做好国家委托的代销代购工作！”这说明了国家对私营工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策。这是完全符合于国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的要求的。因此，私营工商业者首先必须爱国守法，清除“五毒”，改进生产经营，在人民政府领导下进行增产节约运动，并争取使自己的企业逐步走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道。
    关于在过渡时期总路线和第一个五年计划基本任务的规定下，国家对私营工商业所采取的方针、政策和私营工商业者今后努力的方向及其前途，李维汉副主任在中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会上的讲话中，已有极为详明的指示，同志们应该仔细深入地加以钻研学习。二
    同志们！在全国人民为贯彻国家总路线所作的努力中，我们必须首先要求全体会员动员起来，在思想上充分认识到贯彻国家过渡时期总路线的重要政治意义，在行动上积极投入这一个伟大的事业之中，工商业者的会员今后尤其要做到在一切经济活动上不违背国家总路线。这也就是说，我们今后必须以我们各个人的实际行动来表示我们对于国家总路线的忠诚拥护。
    李维汉副主任在中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会上的讲话中，曾经指出：“我们很高兴地看到，几年来，工商界已经出现了一批先进分子，他们有远大眼光，看得见国家的前途和工商界的方向，他们靠拢共产党和人民政府，爱国守法，积极改进生产经营，并在工商业者中保持有相当的联系和信仰。我们希望经过这次代表大会的工作，经过工商业联合会和中国民主建国会的努力，这样的先进分子会从各地各行各业的大、中、小户的工商业者中，日渐增多地培养出来，成为团结和教育广大工商业者的骨干。在共产党和人民政府领导之下，我深信这个希望一定能够变成现实。”李副主任这段话，给了我们正确的启示。
    为了适应国家总路线的要求，本会今后的工作方针和中心任务，就是：通过私营工商业的改造工作、增产节约和各项爱国运动，依靠全体会员的努力，培养和提高本会工商业者的会员成为工商业中的骨干分子，也就是要使他们首先做到真正爱国守法，积极改进生产经营，努力学习，认真接受社会主义改造，忠诚接受中国共产党和人民政府的领导，并紧密联系、团结工商界群众，正确地发挥带头的、模范的和在人民政府与工商界间的桥梁的作用，为贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。
    本会工商业者的会员应当认识到完成上述的中心任务是自己的重大责任。因此，会要求工商业者的会员在会的培养教育之下，努力具备以下条件：
    第一，爱国守法。这是会员最起码的最重要的也是最基本的条件，没有这个条件，就根本谈不到接受社会主义改造。这就是要加强爱国主义的思想，划清守法与违法的界限，在行动上首先是经济活动上，严格遵守政策法令，彻底清除“五毒”，反对偷税漏税、偷工减料、投机套购以及一切不良经营作风。本会会员要在工商界中起带头骨干作用，首先要把任何违法行为，不论程度如何轻微，都看作可耻之事，坚决清除。这几年来，本会会员在思想认识上，一般有了不同程度的进步，但从最近各地方组织已经发现的事实看来，工商业者会员中，有的做到了爱国守法，而在不同程度上，犯有错误或违法行为的人数也相当多。由此可见，要做到真正爱国守法，还需要进行认真的教育和监督。今后，我们全体会员一定要通过大家的努力，为肃清会员的违法行为而奋斗，更希望爱国守法的会员巩固他们这种作风，扩大他们的影响。
    第二，积极改进生产经营。要求会员服从人民政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，以自己能被国家人民所利用为光荣，积极经营有利于国计民生的事业，并从自己的企业做起，以正确的思想和模范的行动，来推动私营工商业者发挥生产经营的积极性，展开增产节约运动，实行企业管理民主化。
    第三，努力学习。要求会员努力学习国家总路线、第一个五年计划基本任务、共同纲领、政策法令和“五反”原则，并注意联系实际，把学习和经济活动结合起来，展开批评和自我批评，做到言行一致，在工商界中起积极作用。
    第四，接受社会主义改造。要求会员认识社会主义改造的意义，对于通过国家资本主义的轨道逐步实现社会主义的改造，采取积极拥护的态度，反对消极等待的思想和行为，依照国家的需要和计划，争取把自己的企业推上国家资本主义的轨道，并在企业改造的过程中，不断地改造自己。
    第五，忠诚接受中国共产党和人民政府的领导。要求会员有远大眼光，认清逐步过渡到社会主义社会是国家的伟大前途，通过国家资本主义接受社会主义的改造是工商界的光明大道，把自己的前途与国家的前途结合起来，使个人利益服从国家利益，紧密联系工商界群众，永远团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，为完成社会主义的改造而奋斗。
    本会的非工商业者的会员，应当努力完成国家任务，遵守国家纪律，加强学习，不断地改造自己，提高自己的理论政策水平和业务水平；并应在本会工作方针和中心任务的要求下，体会上述五项条件的基本精神，认清自己的重大责任，继续积极发挥作用，与本会工商业者会员，相互紧密团结合作，在学习和工作上，实行相互了解、相互尊重、相互帮助、相互教育，共同为贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线而努力。
    这就是本会为了执行今后的工作方针和中心任务对全体会员提出的要求。每一会员应该自觉地服从组织、遵守纪律，严肃地、切实地贯彻执行上述要求。应该指出，过去会对会员的帮助是不够的。从“五反”运动到现在，本会会员在工商界中起的带头骨干作用，是值得提出的，但还是很有限的。现在国家已经向全国人民明确地宣布了过渡时期总路线，在工人阶级领导下的全国人民正在为了实现这一伟大的目标而积极地工作着。在这种形势之下，本会今后的任务更为重大了。我们不应该满足于现有的成就，不应该忽视我们的缺点。我们必须根据这次会议所决定的工作方针和中心任务，在一个时期内，集中力量，帮助现有的会员改正缺点、努力提高，使他们能成为工商界中真正起作用的骨干分子。这样，我们就能为贯彻国家总路线而贡献自己的力量。因此，今后本会的各级组织都应在现有基础上，大力进行巩固与提高；具体到每个会员，也必须巩固已有的成就，认真克服自己的缺点，力求进一步的提高，以符合上述要求。
    同志们！让我们在光辉的毛泽东旗帜下，积极参加国家建设工作，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，为贯彻我们国家过渡时期的总路线和完成第一个五年计划基本任务而奋勇前进吧！
