Touching Enthusiasm for Learning
    ——On the Chinese Language Training Class for Foreign Students at Peking University

    Beginning in the winter of 1950, young men and women from fraternal friendly countries have come to study in our country every year. Starting in the autumn of that year, our government established the Chinese Language Training Class for them at Tsinghua University. After the nationwide adjustment of university departments in the summer of 1952, this class was moved to Peking University. Over the past three years, the number of foreign students has increased approximately tenfold: from the initial 33 students from five countries to 350 students from nine countries (Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, etc.). They study Chinese language for a period of one to two years. There have been graduates in the summer of last year and this year, most of whom have entered the research departments and undergraduate programs of various universities in our country, and some have entered secondary technical schools to continue their studies and research. Currently, there are foreign students at Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and other schools. The majors they have chosen include: Chinese language and literature, history, philosophy, law, diplomacy, economics, trade, fine arts, science, and engineering.
    Each person comes bearing the hopes of the people of their own country; and when they leave here, they will carry back the hopes of the Chinese people. They deeply understand the hopes of the people: to dedicate all their strength to strengthening the friendship between the people of all countries and consolidating the cause of world peace and democracy. A young man from Czechoslovakia, after choosing his major, asked: How can I study to contribute to the cause of world peace and democracy more quickly and more extensively? This precisely illustrates why they can study diligently, work hard, and achieve excellent results.
    Learning Chinese well, and also mastering a major, should be said to be no simple matter, and there will be many difficulties. However, in the past three years, we have not seen a single foreign student who is afraid of difficulties. A young man from Bulgaria—the homeland of Dimitrov—who had participated in the anti-fascist guerrilla war, said when encountering difficulties in his studies: The task given to me by the Party must be completed. If I can't learn it well in one year, I will study for two years, and if two years doesn't work, I will study for three years... What a determination! Korean students, after only half a year of study, were able to use Chinese characters to write their own experiences into poems, and write articles like Gao Yubao's "Midnight Rooster Crows" and Cui Bawa's "The Dog is Biting Again." If you sit in the room and listen to a young Romanian man talking to others outside the room, people would really think it was a Beijing native speaking. It turns out that he spent a full two years constantly reading the text aloud, practicing pronunciation, and using a tape recorder to correct the four tones. A Chinese literature professor from Shanxi who was guiding Hungarian students said: "Their Beijing dialect is better than mine!" A Czechoslovakian youth studying Chinese literature can read about twenty pages of Mao Dun's novels in an hour. Accurately reading and writing Chinese characters is not easy for a foreign student, but a Mongolian youth not only writes Chinese characters well, but also pronounces them accurately. In short, if you happen to meet a foreign student who has studied in China for one or two years, he can converse with you in Chinese.
    While studying, they are also doing work to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and foreign people and to bridge Chinese and foreign cultures: they often write about new things in China for newspapers and magazines in their own countries, and translate Chinese works into their own languages. Chairman Mao's works and the works of our famous writers have been translated into several languages. Students braved the summer heat to translate Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." After Gao Yubao's work was published, everyone rushed to translate it and send it back to their countries for publication. They not only help their own people understand China, but also help the Chinese people understand their own countries. Polish students assisted us in seeking the works of the great poet Mickiewicz; Hungarian students cooperated with Chinese translators to introduce the great poet Petőfi; Czechoslovakian students helped our theater stage a play depicting the great son of the Czechoslovak people, Julius Fučík.
    They love our country's literature and art: they often go to see operas, plays, and musical dance performances, and many people collect ancient and modern Chinese art, including folk crafts and Qi Baishi's paintings. Our writers, such as Feng Xuefeng, Lao She, and Xu Guangping, also care for them like teachers care for their own students, meeting with them, communicating with them, discussing issues, and answering their questions. If they make any requests, everyone always tries to help as much as possible. One student needed to consult volumes 1, 2, and 3 of the "Literary Gazette," but they were sold out in bookstores. When the comrades of the "Literary Gazette" editorial department learned about it, they sent him a set they had kept themselves. Another student was very fond of our country's architectural art and wanted to find a set of pictures of ancient architecture to compile a book for his own people. A professor in the architecture department of Tsinghua University sent them to him.
    Every year there is a long trip during the summer vacation. The students have been to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, to the Huai River, and to factories and rural areas; some have been to Dunhuang to study our ancient art. Each trip and visit deepened the students' understanding of our country. Workers, farmers, and young students everywhere became good friends with them.
    In their studies, they have established deep feelings with their teachers; and young students from various countries have also established deep feelings with each other. Two young people from the German Democratic Republic said to a young teacher who tutored them: If it weren't for his help in many ways, they wouldn't have learned Chinese so quickly. They live and study with our young people, helping each other and making progress together. When Comrade Gottwald passed away, the foreign students set up a mourning hall, and our Chinese students automatically took turns guarding the hall. People carrying wreaths and letters came to pay their respects, filling the mourning hall and the courtyard outside the mourning hall. Many students saved their living expenses and donated them to resist America and aid Korea.
    The new semester has begun again. The old students have returned from traveling and visiting various places, and some have returned from sanatoriums; new students have also come to Beijing from the East and the West. They have all started a new lesson with great enthusiasm for learning.

    感人的学习热情
    ——记北京大学外国留学生中国语文专修班
    郭良夫
    从一九五○年冬天开始，年年都有兄弟友好国家的男女青年到我国来留学。从这一年秋天开始，我们的政府为他们在清华大学设立了中国语文专修班。一九五二年夏季全国高等学校院系调整后，这个班就移设到北京大学来了。三年来，留学生的人数增加约十倍：由最初五个国家的三十三人，增加到九个国家（罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国等）的三百五十人。他们学习中国语文的年限是一年到两年。去年和今年暑期都有结业生，他们大多进入了我国各高等学校的研究部和本科，有的进入中等技术学校，继续进行学习和研究。现在，中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、中央美术学院及其他学校里都有留学生。他们选定的专业有：中国语言文学、历史、哲学、法律、外交、经济、贸易、美术、理工等科。
    每个人都是带着自己祖国的人民的希望来的；离开这里的时候，又将带着中国人民的希望回国。人民的希望，他们是深切理解的：为加强各国人民的友谊，巩固世界和平民主事业，献出所有的力量。一个捷克斯洛伐克的青年在选定自己的专业之后问道：究竟怎样学习才能更快地、更多地对世界和平民主事业贡献出自己的力量呢？这正好说明了他们能认真学习、刻苦钻研，并取得优良成绩的原因。
    学好中国语文，还要学好一门专业，应当说不是一件简单的事，是会有不少困难的。不过，三年来我们并没有看见一个怕困难的留学生。从保加利亚——季米特洛夫的祖国来的青年，曾参加过反抗法西斯的游击战争，在学习中碰到困难的时候说：党交给我的任务一定要完成，一年学不好就学两年，两年不行就三年，……。这是怎样的决心啊！朝鲜留学生才学习了半年，就能用中国文字将自己的经历写成了诗，写成了和高玉宝的“半夜鸡叫”、崔八娃的“狗又咬起来了”一类的文章。如果坐在屋子里听屋子外面的一位罗马尼亚青年同别人谈话，人们真以为那是北京人在说话呢。原来，他用了整整两年的时间，不断朗读课文，练习发音，用录音机校正四声。一位指导匈牙利留学生的山西籍的中国文学教授说：“他们的北京话说得比我强多啦！”学习中国文学的捷克斯洛伐克青年，一小时能看茅盾的小说二十页左右。准确地读、写汉字，对于一个外国同学说来，也不是容易的，但一个蒙古青年不但汉字写得好，而且能准确地发音。总之，你随便遇到一位在中国学习了一两年的留学生，他都可以用中国话和你交谈。
    他们一面学习，一面做着加强中外人民友谊、沟通中外文化的工作：时常将中国的新事情写给本国的报纸和杂志，将中国的著作翻译到本国去。毛主席的著作和我国著名作家的作品，已被译成了好几种文字。同学们冒着暑热翻译毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。高玉宝的作品发表后，大家都争先翻译了寄回国去发表。他们不仅帮助本国人民认识中国，也同样帮助中国人民认识本国。波兰留学生协助我们寻求伟大诗人米凯维兹的作品；匈牙利的留学生和我国的翻译家合作，介绍伟大诗人裴多菲；捷克斯洛伐克的留学生帮助我们的剧院排演描写捷克斯洛伐克人民伟大儿子伏契克的戏剧。
    他们喜爱我国的文学艺术：经常去看歌剧、话剧、音乐舞蹈的演出，很多人收藏着我国古代和现代的美术品，有民间工艺品，也有齐白石的绘画。我国的作家，如冯雪峰、老舍、许广平等，也像学校里的教师关心自己的同学一样，和他们见面通信，讨论问题，给他们解答疑难。如果他们提出什么要求，大家总是尽量帮助。有一位同学需要参考文艺报的一、二、三卷，书店里已卖光了，文艺报编辑部的同志知道以后，就把自存的一套寄赠给他；另
  一位同学对我国建筑艺术十分爱好，想找一套古代建筑的图片，编一本书给本国人民，清华大学建筑系的教授就给送来了。
    每年暑假有一次长途旅行。同学们曾到过上海、南京、杭州、天津，到过淮河，到过工厂和农村；有的曾到过敦煌，考察我国古代美术。每一次旅行参观，都加深了同学们对我国的认识。到处的工人、农民、青年学生，跟他们成了好朋友。
    在学习中，他们与教师建立了深厚的感情；各国青年同学之间也建立了深厚的感情。两个民主德国的青年，对给他们补课的一位青年教师表示：要不是他多方面的帮助，他们的中文是不会学得这么快的。他们和我国青年在一起生活学习，互相帮助，共同进步。哥特瓦尔德同志逝世的时候，留学生布置了灵堂，我国同学自动轮流去守灵。带着花圈和信件来吊唁的人，挤满了灵堂，挤满了灵堂外面的院子。许多同学节余下自己的生活费，拿去作抗美援朝的捐献。
    新的学期又开始了。旧有的同学已从各地旅行参观归来，有的已从休养地回来；新同学也自东方和西方来到了北京。他们都怀着很高的学习热情，开始了新的一课。（附图片）
