    Beijing is Conducting Large-Scale Propaganda on the General Line of the State
    Nearly 200,000 Cadres and Workers Have Listened to Reports and Are Extremely Encouraged
    [This newspaper report] In order to enable all the people of Beijing to understand the general line of the state during the transition period, and thus consciously strive to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city has launched a large-scale publicity and education campaign on the general line of the state during the transition period since late October. Currently, nearly 200,000 people, including staff of state organs, cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, teachers and students of universities and middle schools, members of democratic parties, and people from industry and commerce, have received this publicity and education. This publicity will soon be extended to workers, students, and the broad masses of people throughout the city.
    Before launching the large-scale publicity and education campaign on the general line of the transition period, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Beijing, made reports on the general line of the state during the transition period at the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee, the Beijing Municipal Conference of Party Member Cadres, and the Second Beijing Municipal Congress of the Communist Youth League. Party committees and youth league committees at all levels have also conveyed it to all party members and youth league members in the city. In mid-October, Li Leguang, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on conveying the general line of the state during the transition period to members of various democratic parties, ethnic minorities, and some religious circles in the city. In order to guide the theoretical study of cadres throughout the city, Yang Shu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also made reports on conveying the general line of the state during the transition period to instructors of theoretical study, theoretical teachers, theoretical education cadres, and teachers of secondary schools in the city.
    The responsible comrades of the Party and administration in all units throughout the city attached great importance to the work of conveying the report on the general line of the state during the transition period. The directors or deputy directors of eight units including the Municipal People's Government Local Industry Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, the secretaries of the district committees of Xuanwu District, Chongwen District, and other districts, as well as the factory directors and party committee secretaries of many factories and mines, have made reports on conveying the general line of the state during the transition period to their subordinate cadres. Some responsible cadres of factories and mines have also conveyed the report to their workers.
    After listening to the report on the general line of the state during the transition period, cadres, workers, and teachers and staff of universities and middle schools throughout the city were extremely encouraged. After clarifying the road to transition to socialism, everyone felt "bright in their hearts," "strengthened confidence," and "more motivated to work." Gao Shouheng, a labor model from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: "The general line of the transition period is our guiding lighthouse. I must find more tricks, tap potential, and train technical workers so that our industry can quickly move towards automation and mechanization." Shi Yuru, an accountant in the transportation department of the factory, said: "My work also serves the general line of the state. I must do a better job in accounting and strive to transition to a socialist society as soon as possible." An old worker in his forties at the Beijing People's Printing Factory said: "I must work hard to produce and accumulate more wealth for the country. I want to see with my own eyes the most ideal society for our workers." Some cadres of the Xidan District Cooperative criticized the idea of underestimating commerce and expressed their determination to do a good job in the cooperative, promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. After listening to the report on conveying the general line of the state during the transition period, some people in industry and commerce recognized the direction of private industry and commerce, expressed their willingness to actively improve production and operation, study hard, and accept socialist transformation. The capitalists of private factories and stores such as Fuxing Flour Mill, Dayou Grain Store, and Darentang Chinese Medicine Shop have proposed the requirements of joint state-private ownership. Cadres of the state-private joint venture Xingye Investment Company, after clarifying that state capitalism is the necessary path for the transformation of private industry and commerce, guaranteed to do their job well. Cadres of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau further realized the great significance of the mutual aid and cooperation movement for the socialist transformation of agriculture, thereby improving the consciousness and enthusiasm of their work. Guo Zhengjie, a farmer from Dongheyan Village in Fengtai District, said: "We should produce more grain, sell the surplus grain to the state, and support industrial construction; only when the country is industrialized can it manufacture tractors for us. With machines, rural areas will greatly improve production, and our lives will become happier day by day." Teachers and students of the Twenty-eighth Middle School and the Fifth Girls' Middle School were all delighted after hearing the conveyance of the general line. Young students are determined to work hard to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "three goods" and prepare strength for the industrialization of the motherland.
    In order to further popularize and deepen the publicity and education of the general line of the state during the transition period, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to continue to conduct extensive publicity through various systems such as organs and enterprises, trade unions, youth leagues, schools, state-owned trade, and cooperatives. Organize the party reporters and responsible cadres of various systems to make a report on the general line of the state during the transition period to all staff and workers of state-owned and local state-owned factories, state-owned trade cooperation systems, state-private joint venture factories and stores, private factories and stores, medical workers, literary and art workers, tricycle workers, porters, handicraftsmen, and suburban farmers, so that the broad masses of people can recognize the general line of the state during the transition period and strive to realize the general line. In order to deepen the publicity and education work of the general line of the state during the transition period, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Higher Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League have also formulated study plans for incumbent cadres, teachers, students, and staff of high schools and other schools, and all members of the Youth League in Beijing. In the "Plan for Studying the General Line of the State During the Transition Period for Incumbent Cadres in Beijing," the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates that the time for studying the general line of the state during the transition period is from late October to mid-January next year, requiring all cadres to systematically understand the general line of the state during the transition period through this study, and to clarify that the general line is the basis for formulating the guidelines and policies of various tasks, and is the lighthouse illuminating all tasks, and the general line must be specifically implemented in all tasks. Senior cadres should further raise the general line of the state during the transition period and various policies to the level of Lenin and Stalin's theories on the transition period and socialist construction, in order to improve the level of leadership. From late October, cadres of various organs, industrial and mining enterprises, teachers and students of universities and middle schools, members of various democratic parties, and religious circles in Beijing have officially begun in-depth study of the general line of the state during the transition period.

    北京市大规模宣传国家总路线
    干部职工近廿万人已听了报告极为振奋
    【本报讯】为了使北京市全体人民了解国家在过渡时期的总路线，从而自觉地为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、对手工业、对私营工商业的社会主义改造而奋斗，在中共北京市委的领导下，本市自十月下旬起，已大规模地展开了关于国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育。目前受到这一宣传教育的已有国家机关工作人员、工矿企业干部、大中学校师生、民主党派及工商界人士近二十万人。这一宣传并即将深入到全市工人、学生和广大人民群众中去。
    在大规模地展开关于过渡时期总路线的宣传教育以前，中共北京市委书记、北京市市长彭真同志曾先后在北京市人民政府委员会、北京市党员干部大会及青年团北京市第二届代表大会上，作了关于国家在过渡时期总路线的报告。各级党委和团委并已向本市全体党员团员进行了传达。十月中旬，中共北京市委统战部部长李乐光同志给本市各民主党派、少数民族及部分宗教界人士作了国家过渡时期的总路线的传达报告。为了指导全市干部的理论学习，中共北京市委宣传部部长杨述同志并分别向全市干部理论学习的传授员、理论教员、理论教育工作干部和中等学校的教师作了国家过渡时期总路线的传达报告。
    全市各单位的党和行政负责同志对传达国家在过渡时期总路线报告的工作极为重视。市人民政府地方工业局、劳动局和卫生工程局等八个单位的局长或副局长，宣武区、崇文区等各区区委书记以及许多厂矿的厂长、党委书记等均向所属干部作了国家在过渡时期总路线的传达报告。并有一部分厂矿负责干部已向职工作了传达报告。
    全市干部、工人和大中学教职员等听了关于国家过渡时期总路线的报告后，都极为振奋。大家明确了过渡到社会主义的道路后感觉到“心里豁亮了”，“信心加强了”，“工作劲头更足了”。石景山钢铁厂劳动模范高寿恒说：“过渡时期的总路线是我们的指路灯塔，我一定要多找窍门、挖潜力，培养技术工人，使我们的工业迅速走向自动化、机械化。”该厂运输部会计石玉如说：“我的工作也是为国家总路线服务的，我一定要把会计工作做得更好，争取早日过渡到社会主义社会。”北京人民印刷厂一个四十多岁的老工人说：“我一定要努力生产，多给国家积累财富，我要亲眼看到我们工人最理想的社会。”西单区合作社一部分干部批判了轻视商业的思想，表示一定要搞好合作社工作，促进城乡物资交流，加强工农联盟。一部分工商界人士听了国家过渡时期总路线的传达报告后，认清了私营工商业的努力方向，表示要积极改善生产经营，努力学习，接受社会主义的改造。福兴面粉厂、大有粮店、达仁堂国药铺等私营工厂、商店资方已提出公私合营的要求。公私合营兴业投资公司的干部，在明确了国家资本主义是改造私营工商业的必经道路后，保证要作好自己的工作。农林局干部进一步认识了互助合作运动对农业的社会主义改造的重大意义，从而提高了工作的自觉性和积极性。丰台区东河沿村农民郭贞洁说：“我们应该多打粮食，把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设；只有国家工业化了，才能给我们制造拖拉机，有了机器，农村就会大大地提高生产，我们的生活就会一天比一天幸福了。”二十八中和女五中的师生听了总路线的传达以后，都欢欣鼓舞，青年学生决心要努力执行毛主席关于“三好”的指示，为祖国工业化准备力量。
    为了进一步普及和深入国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，中共北京市委决定，通过各机关企业及工会、青年团、学校、国营贸易、合作社等各个系统，继续进行广泛的宣传。组织各个系统的党的报告员和负责干部，向全市国营及地方国营工厂、国营贸易合作系统、公私合营工厂和商店、私营工厂和商店的全体职工，向医务工作者、文学艺术工作者，三轮工人、搬运工人和手工业者，郊区农民等普遍作一次国家过渡时期总路线的报告，使广大人民能认清国家过渡时期的总路线，并为实现总路线而奋斗。为了使国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育工作深入进行，中共北京市委宣传部、中共北京市委高等学校委员会、市教育局以及青年团北京市委并已分别制订了关于北京市在职干部、高中等学校的教师、学生和职员以及全体团员学习计划。中共北京市委宣传部在“全市在职干部学习国家过渡时期总路线的计划”中规定，自十月下旬至明年一月中旬为学习国家过渡时期总路线的时间，要求全体干部通过这一学习，比较系统地了解国家在过渡时期的总路线，明确总路线是制订各项工作的方针、政策的根据，是照耀一切工作的灯塔，必须在各项工作中具体贯彻总路线。高级干部更应将国家在过渡时期的总路线和各项政策提高到列宁、斯大林关于过渡时期和建设社会主义的理论上来认识，以提高领导工作的水平。从十月下旬起，本市各机关、工矿企业干部、大中学校师生、各民主党派及宗教界人士已经正式开始了国家过渡时期总路线的深入学习。
