    I Want to Sell All My Surplus Grain to the State
    As told by Ma Deqing
    I am Ma Deqing, a military dependent from Lusheng Village, Seventeenth District, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province. I heard the Party organization in our area publicize the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, and I know that our country will gradually realize socialist industrialization, and this year is the first year of the first Five-Year Plan. I am especially happy, and my enthusiasm for production is particularly strong. Because only with national industrialization can the working-class elder brothers produce a large number of machines, and we farmers can live a happy life. I saw that the six tractors at our local technology extension station worked quickly and saved labor. This year, the five hectares of wheat I planted were "threshed" with a threshing machine and finished in half a day. If I had used a stone roller, it would have taken ten days. The workers' strength is really great! Our mutual aid group used new farm tools this year and harvested more grain, with an average of four *shi* of wheat per hectare. In the past, buying a *chi* of good cloth required dozens of *jin* of grain, but now the money from ten *jin* of grain can buy several *chi* of cloth. Aren't these all the benefits of developing industry!

    My past thinking was really wrong! I always thought, "Storing grain is like storing gold." I would always sell a little when I used it, and not sell it when I didn't. Every year, old grain was mixed with new grain, and I sold it off and on until the harvest season. Now that I think about it, I suffered a great loss! Wind, rain, and mice eroded the grain. Last year, six or seven *dou* of eight *shi* of corn were lost in the barn. Using earthen barns to store grain makes the color bad, and you can't sell it for a top price; if the bottom is not padded well, you will suffer even more losses. Furthermore, selling in small quantities is not enough for anything, and it costs labor. Doing so is not good for the country either, as it prevents the country from concentrating its efforts on construction. Selling the surplus grain to the state early means that I won't suffer losses. If I don't need the money, I can store it in the credit cooperative. At the same time, I am supporting the country's economic construction, so that the factories are built well and produce more machines and cheaper goods. Then we can harvest more grain and live a good life. By taking the grain to the front lines, my son and others can eat their fill and eliminate the invading enemies more effectively. Really, whatever Chairman Mao tells me to do, I should do it. I must listen to Chairman Mao's words.

    This year, after deducting the grain for my own use, I will quickly sell all the remaining grain to the state. Five thousand *jin* of wheat has already been delivered to the cooperative, and five thousand *jin* of soybeans and three thousand *jin* of corn are also ready. With the money from selling the grain, I will buy a new rubber-tired cart, improve production, and increase my income.

### 我要把全部余粮卖给国家

    我要把全部余粮卖给国家
    马德庆口述
    我是黑龙江省海伦县十七区禄生村军属马德庆。我听我们那个地方的党组织宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，知道我们国家将逐步实现社会主义工业化，今年就是第一个五年建设计划的头一年。我心里特别地乐，生产劲头特别足。因为只有国家工业化，工人老大哥才能造出大批机器，我们农民才能过幸福的生活。我看到我们那里技术推广站的六台拖拉机干起活来又快又省工。今年我种的五垧小麦，用打谷机“打场”，半天就打完了，要是用磙子，得打十天，真是工人力量大啊！我们互助组今年使用新农具，就多打了粮食，平均每垧麦地打四石小麦。过去买一尺好布就得几十斤粮食，现在十斤粮食的钱就能买几尺布。这不都是发展工业得来的好处吗！
    我过去的思想可太不对啦！我老认为“存粮如存金”，总是用着就卖点，不用就不卖，每年都是陈粮接新粮，离离拉拉卖到大秋。现在算起来，可吃老亏啦！风吹雨淋耗子咬，去年八石玉米就在仓里损失了六、七斗。用土仓子装粮，色气不好，卖不上上等价；底子垫不好就更多受损失。再说，零卖干啥也不够用，还得费工钱。这样做，对国家也没有好处，使国家不能集中力量用到建设上去。早把余粮卖给国家，自己不受损失，用不着钱花，还可以存在信贷部里；同时支援了国家经济建设，使工厂建设好了，多制造机器和便宜的东西，咱们就能多打粮食，过好生活。把粮食拿到前方，叫我儿子他们吃饱了，也好多消灭进犯的敌人。真的，毛主席告诉我干啥，我就该干啥，我一定要听毛主席的话。
    我今年除掉自己用的粮食，余剩的粮食要赶快全部卖给国家。五千斤小麦已经送到合作社去了，五千斤大豆、三千斤玉米也已经准备好了。卖粮得到的钱，要买一台新胶皮车，搞好生产，多增加收入。
