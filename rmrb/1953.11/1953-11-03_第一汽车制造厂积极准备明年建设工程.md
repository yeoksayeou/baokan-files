    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Actively Prepares for Next Year's Construction Project

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, more than three months after its official commencement, overfulfilled this year's construction plan for five major factory buildings by 34.89% on the premise of ensuring quality. Now, the plant is actively preparing for next year's construction project.

    Based on the preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings that have arrived from the Soviet Union, and with reference to the amount of work completed this year, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has initially drafted a general project schedule for next year, as well as plans for labor, material supply, and tool equipment. These plans are currently under review. Starting in November, a construction organization design for 1954 will be prepared. Currently, a draft of the overall construction plan for next year has been drawn up. Next year, the area of civil engineering construction will reach more than 550,000 square meters, with ten major factory buildings to be built simultaneously. Engineering personnel and material supply personnel are planning to use more than 100,000 cubic meters of concrete, more than 60,000 cubic meters of prefabricated components, and tens of thousands of tons of steel materials to meet the needs of this huge project. Many of the buildings to be constructed next year are precise and complex, requiring 70% of the project to be mechanized. Most of the new types of earthmoving machines, excavators, bulldozers, belt conveyors, cranes, tractors, and other machinery manufactured at home and abroad have arrived. Auxiliary factories serving the construction, such as concrete mixers and steel bar factories, have already been built and have begun production. Other factories, such as foam concrete factories, large prefabricated component factories, and metal processing factories, are also preparing to start construction in the winter.

    In addition to receiving comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union in design, construction, and equipment, and assistance in various new machines from fraternal countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia, this factory also has more than 70 factories across the country manufacturing various materials and equipment for it, and transporting huge manpower. The Northeast Region has continuously sent more than 1,000 cadres to it in just a few months. About 10,000 construction workers from construction engineering companies in East China, Central South, Harbin, and other places have also successively joined the construction site. At present, the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant involves people of all ethnic groups from 28 provinces and cities, who are as united as one family in the construction. In order to assist this factory in preparing for the production force after it starts operation, 46 factories across the country are training various technical workers for it.

    To welcome the larger-scale construction project next year, a large number of cadres, engineering technicians, and workers from Beijing, East China, Central South, and Northeast China are arriving at this factory one after another. The workers at the construction site are ending this year's project with full spirit to strive for over-fulfilling the 1953 project tasks, so as to switch to winter construction, winter training, and summary work, and merge with new forces, preparing to create greater achievements for next year's construction project.

    第一汽车制造厂积极准备明年建设工程
    第一汽车制造厂在正式开工三个多月后，在保证质量的基础上超额百分之三十四点八九完成了五个主要厂房的今年建设计划。现在，该厂正在积极进行明年建设工程的准备工作。
    第一汽车制造厂根据已由苏联到达的初步设计、技术设计、施工图等，并参考今年施工的工程量，已初步拟订出明年总的工程进度计划，和劳动、材料供应、工具设备等计划。这些计划正在复核中。十一月起，将编制一九五四年施工组织设计。目前，明年的施工总平面图的草图已绘制出来。明年土木建筑工程面积将达到五十五万多平方公尺，有十个主要厂房将同时兴建。工程人员、材料供应人员正计划以十多万立方公尺的混凝土，六万多立方公尺的预制品，数以万吨计的钢铁材料，来满足这个巨大工程的需要。明年很多的建筑物都很精密而复杂，要求有百分之七十的工程实行机械化施工。现在国内国外制造的新式铲运机、挖土机、推土机、皮带运输机、吊车、拖拉机等各种机械已大部到齐。为施工服务的附属工厂如混凝土搅拌机、钢筋厂等早已建成，并开始了生产。其他如泡沫水泥厂、大型预制品厂、金属加工厂等也准备在冬季施工。
    这个工厂除了从苏联得到由设计、施工到设备等全面的援助，从匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家得到各种新式机器的援助以外，在国内的四面八方还有七十多个工厂为它制造各种材料和设备，为它输送来巨大的人力。东北区在短短的几个月内就给它连续输送来一千多个干部。由华东、中南、哈尔滨等地的建筑工程公司来的约一万人的建筑队伍，也相继地投入了这个工地。现在参加第一汽车制造厂建设的，包括有二十八个省、市的各族人员，他们在建设中团结得像一家人一样。为了协助这个工厂准备开工后的生产大军，全国还有四十六个工厂正在为它训练着各种技术工人。
    为迎接明年更大规模的建设工程，从北京、华东、中南、东北等地来支援这个工厂的大批干部、工程技术人员和工人们正在陆续来到。建筑工地上的工人们正以争取超额完成一九五三年工程任务的饱满精神来结束今年的工程，以便转入冬季施工、冬训和总结工作，并和新的力量汇合，准备着为明年建设工程创造出更大的成绩。
