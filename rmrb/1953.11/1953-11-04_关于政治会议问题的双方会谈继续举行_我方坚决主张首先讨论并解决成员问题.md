    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 3rd: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The eighth meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held on November 3rd. The US representative, Dean, made a lengthy propagandistic speech, full of professed willingness to negotiate, but in reality, he stubbornly stuck to his own views, insisting that the two sides first discuss the time and place of the political conference, while the membership issue could only be the subject of so-called exchange of opinions with our side.

    Mr. Qi Shi-fu, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, immediately pointed out that the other side's statement did not contain any elements that could advance the meeting. The so-called flexible approach proposed by the other side was merely to achieve its goal of refusing to discuss and resolve the membership issue. Mr. Qi Shi-fu emphasized that our side has consistently advocated consultation, but consultation must be conducted on a reasonable basis. It is unreasonable to discuss other issues without first discussing and resolving the membership issue. Our side cannot agree. Our side firmly insists on first discussing and resolving the membership issue, and then proceeding to the discussion of other issues. Whether the bilateral talks can progress depends entirely on whether the other side abandons its stubborn opinion of refusing to discuss and resolve the membership issue. Finally, Mr. Qi Shi-fu stated: Our side reserves the right to comment in detail on the other side's propagandistic speech made today. Our side suggests adjourning the meeting until the 4th, and the US side agreed.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行
    我方坚决主张首先讨论并解决成员问题
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月三日，双方关于政治会议问题的会谈举行第八次会议。美方代表迪安作了冗长的宣传性的发言，满口愿意协商，实则固执己见，坚持双方先谈政治会议的时间与地点问题，而对于成员问题则只能与我方进行所谓交换意见。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生当即指出，对方的发言并不含有任何使会议可以进展的因素。对方提出的所谓灵活的办法，只是为了达到其拒绝讨论并解决成员问题的目的。奇石福先生强调指出，我方一贯主张协商，但协商必须在合理的基础上进行。不首先讨论并解决成员问题而即讨论其他问题，是不合理的。我方不能同意。我方坚决主张首先讨论并解决成员问题，然后进入其他问题的讨论。双方会谈之能否进展，全视对方是否放弃其拒绝讨论并解决成员问题的固执的意见而定。最后奇石福先生表示：我方对于对方今日所作的宣传性的发言，保留予以详细评论的权利。我方建议休会至四日，美方同意。
