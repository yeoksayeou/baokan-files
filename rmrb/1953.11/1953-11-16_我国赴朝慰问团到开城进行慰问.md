Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

　　Our Third Delegation to Korea, headed by General He Long, arrived in Kaesong on the morning of the 14th from Pyongyang, with a total of over 700 people.

　　Those who welcomed the delegation at the station included: Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, Korean People's Army General Li Sang-jo, Member General Choi Yong-han, Secretary-General Zhu Ran, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Du Ping, Members of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, Chinese People's Volunteer Army Generals Ding Guoyu and Chai Chengwen, Chairman of the Kaesong City People's Committee, Han Yuqiao, and Chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Yu Peimu, among others.

　　The delegation of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission and people from all walks of life in Kaesong City held a welcoming meeting of more than 7,000 people at the station square. At the meeting, General Li Sang-jo first delivered a welcome speech. On behalf of the Korean People's Army representatives attending the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, he extended a warm welcome to General He Long and all members of the delegation and expressed sincere respect and gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong. After recounting the various enormous aid provided by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean people, he pointed out: The visit of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea demonstrates the great unity and power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union. Supported by the endless strength of this peace and democracy camp, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people, together with the Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have defeated the armies of the American aggressors and their lackeys on the front lines for three years, forcing the American aggressors to sign the armistice agreement. With the strong support of the peace and democracy camp, and under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people will surely achieve great success in the great struggle to restore the people's economy, build and consolidate the democratic base in the post-war period. The Korean People's Army will maintain a high degree of vigilance, preserve the fruits of victory already gained by the people of the motherland, and complete its glorious task of ensuring the effective implementation of the armistice agreement and unifying the motherland by peaceful means.

　　Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Du Ping, said at the welcoming meeting: We welcome you with a feeling of deep gratitude because you have brought the profound friendship of the people of the motherland to us, the care of Chairman Mao, and the news that the construction of the motherland is leaping forward, which is most precious to us. He concluded by saying: In the three years of struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, we have won, but to consolidate and develop this victory, we must continue to work hard. We can assure you that with the continued support of the people of the motherland, we will respond to and thank the people of the motherland with new achievements. Then, Chairman of the Kaesong City People's Committee, Han Yuqiao, spoke at the meeting, welcoming the arrival of the delegation.

　　General He Long delivered a reply speech amidst warm applause. He said: Please allow me to first express my respect on behalf of all the comrades of the delegation to the heroic people of this city, and to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone for your warm welcome to us. After mentioning that the delegation had been welcomed everywhere by the Korean people and the Korean-Chinese People's Forces since entering Korea, and having witnessed the disasters inflicted by the American aggressors on the Korean people and the heroic actions of the Korean people in carrying out peaceful construction, General He Long pointed out: The people of Kaesong stood on the front lines in the war against aggression. Not only have you personally witnessed the ferocious brutality of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, but you have also seen how arrogant, cunning, and shameless they were in the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom, and you have finally witnessed the crushing defeat of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. We firmly believe that the Korean people, tempered by war, will be more vigilant in the future, and strictly guard against any aggression and conspiracies by the enemy.

　　On the evening of the 14th, the delegation of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission hosted a banquet at the representative delegation club for the third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea headed by General He Long, and personnel from the first sub-delegation.
