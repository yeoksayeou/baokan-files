Xinhua News Agency, November 18th Dispatch from Paris via TASS: On November 15th, mass rallies and demonstrations protesting the rearmament of West Germany were held in nine major French cities; representatives from twenty French provinces participated in these activities.

The representatives of the working people of Alsace and Lorraine held a demonstration in Strasbourg. They carried signs with slogans: "Down with the Nazis!" "Down with the Bonn and Paris Treaties!" A mass rally was held after the march.

Mrs. Eugénie Cotton stated at the meeting that the so-called "European Army" "is neither European nor defensive, because the Soviet Union does not threaten anyone." She said that the French people must prevent the ratification of the Bonn and Paris Treaties because the rearmament of Germany would cause war.

General Petit, a member of the Republican Union of Progress, said that France's foreign policy must be based on the accurate and strict implementation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance. His words aroused warm applause.

Roland Étienne, Vice-Chairman of the People's Republican Party's Vosges Provincial Committee, Dumench, Chairman of the Lorraine Resistance Movement Participants Association, and other speakers also emphasized the need to prevent the ratification of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty.

The heroic French patriot Henri Martin chaired a mass rally in Bruay, attended by six thousand representatives from the Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, Loire, Indre, and Cher departments. At the meeting, representatives of the local branches of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Catholic Church, and independent trade unions all called for an end to the militarization of Germany.

Similar rallies were also held in Meaux (Seine-et-Marne), Tarbes (Hautes-Pyrénées), and many other cities on November 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, November 18th Dispatch from Rome via TASS: The Italian National Peace Council issued a bulletin. The bulletin said: Recently, demonstrations against the arming of West Germany and against the so-called "European Defense Community" have been held throughout Italy. A large-scale people's rally was held in Milan, where Emilio Sereni, a member of the World Peace Council, spoke. The Milan District Committee for the Defense of Peace, together with the Italian Veterans Association, organized more than fifty rallies, and those present expressed their opposition to the "European Defense Community" and the arming of West Germany. Peace defenders have also been actively carrying out activities in Rome and Turin. Participants in the rallies in Cagliari, Siena, Termo, Arezzo, and other cities also expressed their opposition to the arming of West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th Dispatch from Moscow via TASS: "Pravda" published an article by Paul de Groot, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, discussing the Dutch people's struggle for the security of their homeland.

De Groot wrote that the American ruling clique is putting pressure on the Dutch government to get the "European Defense Community" treaty ratified. Washington openly threatens to cut loans to the Netherlands. The United States used this method to make the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament discuss and pass the law approving the "European Army" treaty. However, the Upper House has not yet ratified it.

De Groot continued, not long ago, the Communists were still fighting alone against the Netherlands joining aggressive blocs and against the revival of German fascism and militarism. Today, the mass movement against the ratification of the "European Army" treaty has spread throughout the country. As a result, the voting in Parliament showed that members of other parties joined with Communist members in opposing the ratification of this treaty.

De Groot mentioned that German fascists brutally shot, hanged, gassed, or slowly tortured to death 250,000 Dutch citizens in concentration camps during World War II. The Dutch people are increasingly aware that the restoration of the German "Wehrmacht" under the guise of the "European Army" will bring another war to the Netherlands, thereby endangering the Netherlands' existence as a nation.

De Groot said that the Soviet government's peaceful policy of resolving international issues on the basis of understanding and agreement is in line with the basic and vital interests of all peace-loving people, including the Dutch people. The actions of patriots have disrupted the plans of the reactionaries. The masses have initially achieved national unity of action and have initially united the forces of all social strata who opposed the German occupiers.

De Groot concluded that the Dutch Communist Party is waging a persistent struggle, uniting all patriotic forces nationwide on the basis of national unity, and striving for the victory of the cause of national independence, security, and peace.

    法意等国人民反对“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：十一月十五日，法国九个大城市举行了抗议重新武装西德的群众集会和示威游行；法国二十个省的代表参加了这些活动。
    阿尔萨斯和洛林的劳动人民代表在斯特拉斯堡举行了示威游行。他们拿着标语牌：“打倒纳粹！”“打倒波恩和巴黎条约！”游行以后举行了群众集会。
    欧仁妮·戈登夫人在会上发言说，所谓“欧洲军”“既不是欧洲的也不是防御的，因为苏联并不威胁任何人。”她说，法国人必须阻止批准波恩和巴黎条约，因为德国的重新武装会引起战争。
    进步共和联盟的盟员柏蒂将军说，法国的外交政策必须以准确地和严格地履行法苏友好互助条约为基础。他这话引起了热烈的掌声。
    人民共和党孚日省委员会副主席罗兰·艾蒂安，洛林省抵抗运动参加者协会的主席迪孟奇和其他发言人也强调必须阻止批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    英勇的法国爱国者亨利·马丁在布勒瓦的群众集会上担任主席，有六千名代表参加这个集会，他们来自罗亚尔—舍尔省、昂德尔—罗亚尔省、罗亚省、昂德尔省和舍尔省。会上，共产党、社会党地方支部代表、天主教和独立工会的代表都号召制止德国的军国主义化。
    十一月十五日，麦隆（塞纳—马恩省）、塔布（上比里牛斯省）以及许多其他城市中也举行了类似的集会。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社罗马十五日讯：意大利全国和平理事会发出公告。公告说：最近意大利各地纷纷举行了反对武装西德、反对所谓“欧洲防务集团”的示威游行。在米兰举行了大规模的人民集会，世界和平理事会的委员埃米略·塞伦尼在会上讲了话。米兰区保卫和平委员会与意大利退伍军人协会共同组织了五十余次集会，到会者都表示反对“欧洲防务集团”和武装西德。和平保卫者在罗马和都灵也积极展开了活动。参加卡利阿利、西埃那、特尔摩、阿累左各城市的集会的人也都表示反对武装西德。
      【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：“真理报”刊登了荷兰共产党中央委员会总书记保罗·格鲁特的文章，论述荷兰人民为祖国的安全所进行的斗争。
    格鲁特写道，美国统治集团正向荷兰政府施加压力，以使“欧洲防务集团”条约获得批准。华盛顿公开威胁要削减对荷兰的贷款。美国用这个办法使得荷兰议会下院讨论并通过了批准“欧洲军”条约的法律。然而，上院到现在还未批准。
    格鲁特继续说，不久以前，共产党人还是单独地进行着反对荷兰加入侵略集团、反对使德国法西斯主义和军国主义复活的斗争。在今天，反对批准
  “欧洲军”条约的群众运动已在全国扩展起来了。结果，在议会的投票中可以看出，其他党派的议员与共产党议员一起反对批准这个条约。
      格鲁特提到德国法西斯在第二次世界大战中曾残酷地枪杀，吊死，关在煤气房中闷死或者在集中营里慢慢地折磨死二十五万荷兰公民。荷兰人民越来越认识到，在“欧洲军”幌子下恢复德国“国防军”，将给荷兰带来另一次战争的危险，从而使荷兰有亡国的危险。
    格鲁特说，苏联政府所主张在谅解与协议的基础上解决国际问题的和平政策，是符合全体爱好和平人民，包括荷兰人民在内的基本切身利益的。爱国者的行动打乱了反动派的计划。群众已经初步取得全国性的行动一致，已经初步把反对德国占领者的各社会阶层的力量团结了起来。
    格鲁特最后说，荷兰共产党正在进行坚持不懈的斗争，在全国一致的基础上团结全国所有爱国力量，争取国家的独立、安全与和平事业的胜利。
