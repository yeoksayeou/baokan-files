    Miracle Beyond the Great Wall
    By our correspondent Li Gendi
    In Anxi County, outside the ancient Jiayu Pass, people are busy building new warehouses, stables, and houses, and purchasing strong draft animals. I remember that in the spring of the year before last, the residents of Anxi were still digging wild vegetables to get through the spring famine. But this year, in the agricultural area of 28,651 people, farmers have a surplus of 10 million jin of grain. This is a miracle in the history of the frontier. Previously, it was a place so poor that it had to rely on imported grain every year to survive. Now, it is strong enough to extend its own hand to help the country's urban and industrial construction.
    One bumper harvest after another appearing in the agricultural area near the Gobi Desert is not an easy thing. From spring to winter, it is rare to see a snowflake or a drop of rain. In the scorching summer sun, even the drought-resistant camel grass is withered and yellow. When the wind rises, sandstorms block out the sun. Sandstorms cross the highway, blocking it; huge solitary trees are uprooted. Sandstorms sweep across the manor, blowing off the roofs, and swathes of wheat seedlings are beaten down. The farming technology here is also backward. The wooden plow used for cultivation is still the "two oxen pulling a bar" depicted in the Dunhuang murals... The only thing that can nourish the land is the snow water from the Qilian Mountains, but the snow water also has blood and tears. During the reign of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the people of Yumen and Anxi counties once built the Changma River to channel snow water, but it fell into disrepair over the years and became paralyzed. A large amount of snow water disappeared in the Gobi Desert, part of it flowed into the three-hundred-li-long Shule River, and then escaped to the desolate grassland through the riddled channels, with most of the remainder being diverted by the pseudo-government officials and landlords into their own fields. Every year and every month, farmers from different counties, canals, upstream and downstream areas frequently engaged in fights over water. In April 1948, according to the lunar calendar, in one fight between the masses of Anxi and Yumen counties, more than 40 people were injured. Since then, year after year, the desolate frontier became even more desolate. Debt tightly strangled the necks of the farmers, and more than 20,000 farmers were burdened with debt equivalent to 4,000 shi of grain.
    This is the old picture of the people beyond the Great Wall.
    The frontier farmers, who have endured many disasters, have created many methods and accumulated rich experience in fighting natural disasters over the years. After liberation, their wisdom can be fully utilized. Since they have overthrown the monopolists of snow water, they cannot let the snow water flow away everywhere, but must make use of it bit by bit. The People's Government has turned the people's wishes into strength, convened various representative meetings, widely gathered mass opinions, and formulated various methods for water management. During the construction period, finding no help from water conservancy experts, people transformed themselves into experts in production practice. For example, to reduce sediment in the canal, they experimented with bricks, felt, and crushed stone concrete to pave the riverbed. Because the price was too expensive and the effect was not great, they finally found a way to narrow the channel and increase the flow rate, which was successfully tested. When water passed through sandy land, the channel was not strong because the sand grains were loose. The masses created a method of squeezing firewood and grass between layers of sand dikes to reduce the scouring force of the water and protect the channel. The rebuilt Beigong Dam and Barrage in Anxi County were constructed based on the principle of using local materials, utilizing reeds, ropes, stones, and wood. In the first half of last year alone, the county renovated, newly built, and repaired 377 kilometers of large and small canals. Over the years, the residents of Anxi County have contributed a total of more than 220,000 workdays, and 1,318,051 bundles of firewood and grass, not to mention carpenters, stonemasons, carters, and firewood workers.
    Last spring, the Anxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the difficulties caused by water shortage in Anxi and decided to adopt measures such as "centralized rotational irrigation," "shallow irrigation," and "irrigation from upstream to downstream." This spring, the County Committee analyzed that there was less snowfall in the Qilian Mountains last winter, and the sowing area of spring wheat this year was one-third larger than last year. Coupled with the large amount of wind and sand every year, the County Committee predicted that this year would be the most difficult year for Anxi. During the spring flood season, County Party Secretary Chang Kun sounded the alarm both inside and outside the Party, calling for "seizing the first and second rounds of irrigation, resolutely doing a good job in rushing to irrigate the third and fourth rounds of water, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for the greatest harvest." Sure enough, in June this year, the amount of snowmelt in the Qilian Mountains was very small, and the canal water suddenly decreased. Spring wheat was in the flowering and fruiting stage, and the land in the first and fifth districts had not been watered for a month. Seeing that the summer fields were about to have a poor harvest, the County Committee and the County People's Government took emergency measures to concentrate all the mountain water and carry out unified rotational irrigation, strictly calculating water use per hour. Due to the concentrated use of water, evaporation and infiltration were reduced, and the water speed was accelerated. In the past, it took a month to irrigate the summer fields in the first and fifth districts, but this year it took only seventeen days, and a large amount of water was saved. The farmers sent the saved water to Xihu Township, which was divided by the Gobi Desert two hundred miles away. This was the first time in Anxi County.
    During the rescue of the summer fields, County Party Secretary Chang Kun personally grasped the irrigation situation. When he went to Liugong Township and Bagong Township in the fifth district and saw that the canal water was almost cut off, he immediately convened a mass meeting, explaining that the snow water situation was very bad, and that failure to adopt centralized rotational irrigation would inevitably lead to famine. The farmers each had their own plans, and they suspiciously asked: "Can you guarantee to finish watering my land on time?" "Will you water my land first after concentration?" Some disregarded the water regulations and began to steal water. Those who were releasing water were afraid that there would be no water in the future, so they fiercely irrigated, killing the wheat. Comrade Chang Kun explained to them that the pilot method would definitely be better than the current situation, and obtained the consent of the masses. The water from the two townships was merged, and each was watered for six days first. After Liugong Township released water, he rushed along the canal day and night. The water flow doubled and the water speed increased. On the noon of the third day, the new measure of "centralized irrigation" was completely victorious. He hurriedly rushed to Bagong Township, urgently organized a team to water the land, and the masses asked in surprise: "How did Liugong Township finish watering in three days?" The old man was moved to tears.
    In this way, under the correct leadership of the Party and the diligent labor of the broad masses of farmers, Anxi County has achieved higher and higher harvests year after year. Last year, the county's wheat created a record high yield of an average of 226 jin per mu. And this year, it has greatly exceeded last year, reaching an average harvest of 275 jin per mu, creating a miracle beyond the Great Wall.

    塞外的奇迹
    本报记者　李根蒂
    在古老的嘉峪关外的安西县里，人们正忙碌地建筑新的仓房、马厩和房屋，购买强壮的耕畜。记得前年春上，安西的居民为渡过春荒，还在挖苦菜。然而今年，在两万八千六百五十一人的农业区里，农民已有了一千万市斤的余粮。这是塞外历史上的奇迹。以前，它是贫困到年年要靠外来的粮食过活的地方，现在，它却强壮到还有力量伸出自己的手，来援助祖国的城市和工业建设。
    一个接连一个的丰收，出现在戈壁附近的农业区里，并不是一件容易的事。这儿从春到冬，很难下一片雪、落一滴雨。盛夏的太阳，连抗旱的骆驼草也被晒得枯黄。狂风一起，风沙遮蔽了天日。风沙穿越公路，公路阻塞了，巨大的孤树连根飞起。风沙掠过庄园，房顶揭跑了，麦苗被一片一片打落下来。这里的耕作技术也是落后的，耕地的木犁农具，还是敦煌壁画上描绘的“二牛抬杠”……。唯一可以滋养土地的便是那祁连山的雪水，然而雪水里也有血泪。清乾隆年间，玉门、安西两县人民曾经兴修过流注雪水的昌马河，以后年久失修，它显得瘫痪了。大量的雪水在戈壁滩里消失，一部分流入三百里长的疏勒河，又由千疮百孔的渠道逃往荒漠的草原，剩下来的大半被伪政府官员和地主灌进自己的田园。每年每月，县与县、渠与渠、上游和下游的农民，因争水经常发生械斗。一九四八年农历四月间，安西、玉门两县群众一次械斗就互相打伤了四十多人。从此，年复一年，荒凉的塞外更加荒凉了，债务把农民脖子拴得紧紧的，两万多农民肩上压下了折合四千石粮食的债务。
    这就是塞外人民旧日的图景。
    饱经灾难的塞外农民，多年来对自然灾害作战中，创造了许多办法，积累了丰富的经验，解放后，他们的智慧可以充分发挥了。他们既然推翻了雪水的垄断者，就不能让雪水到处流失，必须一点一滴地加以利用。人民政府把人民的愿望变成了力量，召开了各种代表会议，广泛地汇集群众意见，制订出治水的各种办法。修建施工期间，找不到水利专家的帮助，人们在生产实践中把自己变成了专家。比如究竟沙在渠中要怎样才可以减少沉淀，先后试验用砖、毛毡以及碎石混凝土来铺河床，因为价太贵，效果不大，最后摸索出挤窄渠道提高流速的办法，试验成功了。水从沙地经过，因沙粒松散，渠道很不结实，群众创造了用柴草挤在一层一层沙堤中间，减少水的冲涮力，保护了渠道。安西县重建的北工坝和拦河坝，就是根据就地取材原则，利用芨芨草绳和石块木头构成的。仅仅去年上半年，全县改修、新修、补修的大小渠道就有三百七十七公里。几年以来，安西县的居民共总献出了二十二万多人工，用柴草一百三十一万八千零五十一捆，至于木工、石工、车工、柴工还不在内。
    去年春季，中共安西县委会研究了安西因缺水造成的困难，决定采取“集中轮灌”、“薄浇浅灌”、“由上游灌往下游”等办法，今年春天，县委分析了去年冬季祁连山下雪少，今年春麦播种面积比去年增加三分之一，加上每年风沙大，县委预料到今年将是安西最困难的一年。春汛期间，县委书记常崑就在党内外敲起警钟，号召“抓紧一、二轮水的浇灌，坚决做好抢浇三轮四轮水，克服一切困难，争取最大丰收。”果然，今年六月，祁连山积雪融消量很小，渠水突然减少，春小麦正在扬花结实，一区和五区的地，有一个月没有浇过水，眼看夏田要歉收了，就在这时，县委和县人民政府采取了紧急措施，把全部山水集中起来，统一轮灌，每小时严格计算用水。由于水的集中使用，减少了蒸发和渗透，加快了水速，一区和五区的夏田，往年要一个月才能灌溉完，今年十七天就灌完了，并且节余了大量的水。农民们将节余的水放送到二百里外被戈壁分割的西湖乡，这在安西县还是第一次。
    在抢救夏田期间，县委书记常崑亲自掌握灌水情况，他到五区的六工乡和八工乡，看见渠水几乎断流，他马上召集群众会，说明雪水的情况非常恶劣，不采取集中轮灌必将带来灾荒。农民们各有自己的算盘，他们怀疑地提出：“你能保障按时浇完我的地吗？”“集中后先浇我的地吗？”有的不顾水规，开始偷水，正在放水的人怕将来没水，狠狠地浇灌，把麦子浇死了。常崑同志向他们说明试行办法一定比现在情况好的道理，征得群众同意，两乡合并渠水，先各浇六天。六工乡放水后，他不分昼夜地一直奔跑在渠道上，水势变大了一倍，水速提高了，就在第三天中午“集中灌溉”的新措施完全胜利，他又匆匆地赶往八工乡，紧急编组浇地的队伍，群众吃惊地问：“怎么六工乡三天就浇完了。”老头子感动得流下泪来。
    就是这样，安西县在党的正确领导下，在广大农民的辛勤劳动下，获得了一年比一年高的收获。去年，全县小麦创造了历史上没有过的高额产量，达到每亩平均二百二十六斤。而今年，又大大地超过了去年，达到每亩平均收获二百七十五斤，创造了塞外的奇迹。
