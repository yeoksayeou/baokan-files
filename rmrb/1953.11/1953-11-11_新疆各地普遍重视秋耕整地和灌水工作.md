Xinjiang各地普遍重视秋耕整地和灌水工作
Various areas in Xinjiang are universally emphasizing autumn plowing and land preparation. Currently, late-autumn crops are nearing harvest in various regions. To lay a solid foundation for increased production next year, farmers of all ethnic groups are continuing to carry out autumn plowing and irrigation work. Due to this year's bumper harvest, farmers of all ethnic groups recognize that improving farming techniques is a key factor in achieving increased production, so farmers are particularly enthusiastic about autumn plowing this year. For example, in the Democratic and Unity townships in the suburbs of Dihua City, fallow land and stubble land have generally been plowed twice, and in some cases up to four times. Farmers in the First District of Yuepu Lake County plowed more than 5,800 mu of wheat stubble one to three times after the summer harvest. Farmers in various regions have also made significant improvements in plowing methods. For example, in the Seventh District of Dihua County, fallow land and wheat stubble land are mostly plowed first shallowly and then deeply. The Fourth Village of the First Township in the district also uses the method of double plows for intensive cultivation to increase the depth. In order to utilize autumn mountain water and spring water to irrigate autumn-plowed land, various regions have raced to plow mountain water fields and spring water fields while harvesting.

Party and government organs in various regions generally attach importance to leading autumn plowing and winter irrigation work. In most areas, in addition to making calls and mobilizing, a large number of new-style walking plows have been lent out, and cadres have been sent to the countryside to guide farmers in plowing techniques. For example, Yuepu Lake County convened a forum of labor models and high-yield households as soon as the summer harvest ended to study the instructions from higher authorities regarding autumn plowing, combined with local natural conditions and experience, and discussed autumn plowing methods and plans. The Shache Special District also thoroughly studied and arranged autumn plowing work at the mutual aid team leader meeting held in July. The Deputy Secretary of the CPC Fukang County Committee personally taught farmers how to use and repair new-style walking plows, and guided autumn plowing. Since September, technical guidance stations in various regions have also focused on guiding autumn plowing and autumn planting.

However, there are still some areas that are not accustomed to autumn plowing or have not mastered the principle of shallow first and then deep, and there is a tendency for individual plowing times to be excessive. In many more areas, it is believed that crops have been harvested, so water sources and canals are no longer repaired, and water management organizations have been informally disbanded. In order to correct the above shortcomings and deviations, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has successively issued instructions on autumn agricultural production and seizing winter irrigation work, requiring that all land that can be autumn-plowed must be plowed once, and deep plowing should be widely promoted; areas without autumn plowing habits should strengthen publicity and education, and conduct specific guidance and organization work to gradually change the habits of the masses and expand the autumn plowing area. It is required that all regions fully understand the characteristic of this province that spring water is late and winter water volume is relatively abundant, and that winter irrigation must be seized in order to solve some of the difficulties of spring water shortage. Based on specific conditions, winter irrigation plans should be formulated. Areas with existing winter irrigation habits should continue to deepen mobilization, requiring universal irrigation, and areas without winter irrigation habits must strengthen publicity and education, and focus on promotion through typical pilot projects.

    新疆各地普遍重视秋耕整地和灌水工作
    新疆各地今年较普遍地重视秋耕整地工作。目前各地晚秋作物即将收割完毕，为给明年增产打好基础，各族农民继续展开秋耕和灌水工作。由于今年丰产，各族农民认识到提高耕作技术是获得增产的主要环节，所以今年农民秋耕的情绪特别高涨。如迪化市郊民主、团结两乡，今年的歇地和槎地一般都犁过两遍，多者有到四遍的。岳普湖县一区农民在夏收后就把五千八百多亩麦槎都翻犁了一至三次。各地农民犁地的方法也有很大改进。如迪化县七区的歇地和麦槎地大部是先浅后深，该区一乡四村并用套犁细耕办法，增加深度。为了利用秋季山水和泉水灌秋翻地，各地在收割的同时并抢犁了山水田和泉水田。
    各地党政机关一般也都重视对秋耕冬灌工作的领导。大部地区除作了号召和动员外，并贷放大批新式步犁，派干部下乡指导农民翻犁技术。如岳普湖县在夏收刚结束时就召集劳动模范和丰产户座谈，研究了上级关于秋耕的指示，结合当地自然情况和经验，讨论了秋耕的方法和计划。莎车专区在七月间召开的互助组长代表会上也详细地研究和布置了秋耕工作。中共阜康县委副书记亲自给农民传授新式步犁的使用和修理技术，指导秋耕。自九月起各地技术指导站也都以指导秋耕秋种为中心。
    但也还有些地区对秋耕没有习惯，或没有掌握住先浅再深的原则，并有个别翻犁次数过多的偏向。更有不少地区，认为庄稼都已收割，因之对水源、水渠不再整修，管水组织也无形中涣散。为了纠正以上缺点和偏向，新疆省人民政府已先后发出关于秋季农业生产工作和抓紧冬灌工作的指示，要求各地凡可能秋耕的土地必须普耕一遍，并广泛提倡深耕；没有秋耕习惯地区要加强宣传教育，进行具体的指导组织工作，逐渐改变群众习惯，扩大秋耕面积。要求各地充分认识本省春水迟而冬季水量比较充足，必须抓紧冬灌，才能解决一部分春季缺水的困难这一特点。根据具体情况，订出冬灌计划，原有冬灌习惯地区应继续深入动员，要求达到普遍灌溉，无冬灌习惯地区，必须加强宣传教育，通过典型试办作重点推广。　（符镇殿）
