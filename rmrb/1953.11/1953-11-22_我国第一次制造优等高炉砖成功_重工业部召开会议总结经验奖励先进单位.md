    China Successfully Manufactures First-Class Blast Furnace Bricks
    Ministry of Heavy Industry Holds Meeting to Summarize Experience and Reward Advanced Units

    [By this newspaper] With the help of Soviet experts, the refractory material plants in Anshan, Benxi, Tangshan, Taiyuan, and other places have successfully manufactured first-class blast furnace bricks. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry held a national blast furnace brick conference in Beijing from November 17th to 21st to summarize experience and reward advanced units and individuals. During the conference, a refractory materials exhibition was also held.
    Refractory materials are essential materials in the steel smelting industry. Blast furnace bricks are high-quality refractory material products. In the past, the lining bricks used in China's iron-smelting furnaces were all ordered from abroad. After liberation, although blast furnace bricks could be manufactured domestically, the quality of the bricks was very low and could not withstand high temperatures. The furnaces had to be shut down and repaired in less than two years. Therefore, the time each blast furnace was shut down for repairs averaged more than 20 days per year, and accidents such as furnace hearth burn-throughs often occurred, seriously affecting production. Last year, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry instructed refractory material plants in Anshan, Benxi, Tangshan, Taiyuan, and other places to trial-produce first-class blast furnace bricks. During the trial production process, each plant absorbed advanced Soviet experience and simplified the original more than 300 complex forms of fire bricks, weighing more than 100 kilograms each, into six unified small bricks. During the trial production period, Soviet expert Smirnov, based on Soviet experience and China's specific conditions, formulated advanced operating procedures, explained advanced operating methods to the technical personnel and workers of each plant, and personally guided the trial production work of Anshan, Benxi, and other plants. The employees of each plant demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in the trial production. The employees of Angang Refractory Material Plant used waste steel plates and waste shafts to make nine brick pressing machines. The technicians and workers of Tangshan Steel Plant closely cooperated to carry out a series of tests on the ingredients and went to the mines to select raw materials. Angang worker Li Zhenfeng created the "three-section sieve" to ensure the proportion of mud particle size. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant worker Li Guohua created the "three-turn four-beat" molding method. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientific research institutions also sent people to the refractory material plants to assist. The first-class blast furnace bricks manufactured by each plant have met the national specifications and have begun to be used in the major repairs and construction of blast furnaces across the country. After each plant's iron-smelting furnace was converted to use first-class blast furnace bricks, the life of the blast furnace was extended, and the maintenance time was reduced. It is estimated that each blast furnace can increase the national output by about 5 billion yuan per year.
    After the successful trial production of blast furnace bricks, each refractory material plant is preparing to accept the recommendations of Soviet experts to trial-produce high-alumina bricks to replace the very expensive carbon bricks. Tangshan Steel Plant has now successfully trial-produced high-alumina bricks. Using this type of brick in blast furnaces can extend the furnace life by more than ten years, which can increase the national production of pig iron even more.
    At the National Blast Furnace Brick Conference, the factory directors, advanced technical personnel, advanced workers, and labor models of each refractory material plant all expressed that they would further strive to manufacture high-alumina bricks and other advanced refractory materials to create more favorable conditions for the nation's steel smelting industry.

    我国第一次制造优等高炉砖成功
    重工业部召开会议总结经验奖励先进单位
    【本报讯】鞍山、本溪、唐山、太原等地的耐火材料厂，在苏联专家的帮助下，制造优等高炉砖成功。中央重工业部在十一月十七日到二十一日在京召开全国高炉砖会议，总结经验，并奖励先进单位和先进人物。会议期间，还举办了耐火材料展览会。
    耐火材料是钢铁冶炼工业中的必需材料。高炉砖是高质量的耐火材料的制品。过去，我国炼铁炉所用衬砖都是向国外订购的。解放后，国内虽然可以制造高炉砖，但是砖的质量很低，不能耐高温，不到两年就得停炉拆修。因此，每一高炉每年因拆修而停炉的时间平均达二十多天，并且还常有炉缸被烧穿种种事故发生，严重地影响生产。去年，中央重工业部指示鞍山、本溪、唐山、太原等地的耐火材料厂试制优等高炉砖。各厂在试制过程中，吸取了苏联先进经验，将原有三百多种形式复杂的一百多公斤重的火砖筒化成了统一的六种小型砖。在试制时期，苏联专家斯米尔诺夫根据苏联经验与我国的具体情况，拟订了先进的操作规程，向各厂技术人员和工人讲解先进操作方法，并亲自指导鞍山、本溪等厂的试制工作。各厂职工在试制中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。鞍钢耐火材料厂职工利用废钢板和废轴制成了九台压砖机。唐山钢厂的技术人员和工人密切合作对配料作了一系列的试验，并到矿山选择原料。鞍钢工人李振峰创造“三节筛”，保证了泥料粒度的配合比例。太原钢铁厂工人李国华创造“三翻四打”成型法。中国科学院和其他科学研究机关也派人到各耐火材料厂协助。各厂制造的优等高炉砖，已经合乎国家规定的规格，并开始在全国各高炉大修和建设中应用。各厂炼铁炉改用优等高炉砖以后，延长了高炉寿命，减少了检修时间。据估计平均每个高炉每年可为国家增产五十亿元左右。
    各耐火材料厂在试制高炉砖成功后，准备接受苏联专家的建议，试制高铝砖，代替成本很高的炭砖。现在唐山钢厂已试制高铝砖成功。高炉用这种砖，炉体寿命可延长十年以上，就可以为国家增产更多的生铁。
    在全国高炉砖会议上，各耐火材料厂的厂长、先进技术人员、先进工人和劳动模范，都表示要进
  一步努力制造高铝砖和其他高级耐火材料，为国家的钢铁冶炼工业创造更有利的条件。
