China Department Store Changchun City Company No. 1 Store has achieved success in implementing the exhibition-style sales method, and the Changchun City Commercial Bureau has decided to promote it throughout the city's department store system. The No. 1 Store implemented a "continuous shift system" in mid-August, with the clothing group divided into three mutual aid groups for work. Initially, it went smoothly, but later, as the weather turned cooler, many people came to buy woolen sweaters. The original six salespersons couldn't handle it. Although four temporary helpers were added, the order remained chaotic due to overcrowding. As a result, only four or five out of more than twenty kinds of goods could be displayed to customers, and the salespersons sometimes became impatient with customers because they couldn't handle the crowd, even leading to arguments. Comrade Feng Zhengheng, who was in charge of business, conducted in-depth research with the group and found that customers spent a lot of time choosing goods, which was the main reason for the congestion. Therefore, they further studied the relevant parts of the Soviet book "Organization and Technology of Soviet Trade." After repeated research, they decided to try the exhibition-style sales method without increasing staff.

The exhibition-style sales method involves hanging various woolen sweaters on display racks, marked with codes and prices, and having a product introduction person provide information. In this way, all goods can be displayed to customers, facilitating their free selection. After a customer selects a woolen sweater, they only need to remember the product code and price of the item they want, then pay at the payment counter, exchange for a card, and immediately obtain the woolen sweater. On the salesperson side, the time spent answering customer inquiries and showing samples used to account for 30% to 40% of the entire business time. Now, with just one person introducing the products, all the time of the others can be saved for sales. At the same time, because of the clear division of labor, everyone is familiar with the business and has improved their work. The product introduction person skillfully introduces various products and the procedures for exhibition-style sales, so that many illiterate customers can also buy at will; the delivery clerk delivers goods according to the product code, eliminating errors in lost or mismatched goods. Therefore, the phenomenon of mutual shirking of responsibility for lost goods and discrepancies in payments after the implementation of the "continuous shift system" has also been overcome.

After the successful implementation of the exhibition-style sales method, customers are very satisfied. Everyone can easily buy various goods. Many people happily ask: Who thought of this good method? The work of the salespersons has also returned to normal. Previously, on Sundays, the woolen sweater section required four temporary helpers to sell 600 pieces, and the phenomenon of lost or mismatched goods was quite serious. Now, without anyone's help, 850 pieces can be sold, but it is not as hectic as before. Based on the experience of the No. 1 Store, the Changchun City Commercial Bureau is promoting it to the city's department store system. (Feng Qian)

    中国百货公司长春市公司第一商店
    实行展览式售货法便利顾客选购商品
    中国百货公司长春市公司第一商店实行展览式售货法获得成功，长春市商业局已决定在全市百货系统中推广。第一商店于八月中实行“连带上班制”，服装小组划分三个互助小组进行工作。开始时，还很顺利，后来，气候渐凉，许多人都来购买绒衣，原有六个营业员照顾不过来，虽然临时增加四人帮忙，但因人多拥挤，秩序仍很混乱。结果，二十多种商品只能有四、五种和顾主见面，而营业员因照顾不过来，有时对顾主表现不耐烦，甚至发生吵嘴现象。负责业务的封政衡同志深入小组研究，发现顾主们挑选商品花费时间很长，是造成拥挤的主要原因。于是进一步学习苏联的“苏维埃贸易组织与技术”一书中的有关部分，经过多次研究，决定在不增加人员的基础上，试行展览式售货法。
    展览式售货法是把各种绒衣挂在展览架上，标明代号和价格，由商品介绍员进行介绍。这样，全部商品都可和顾主见面，便利了购买者自由挑选。购买者看好一种绒衣后，只要记住自己所要的商品代号和价格，即可到交款处交款，换取卡片，立刻取得绒衣。营业员方面，过去答复顾主询问和招待看货样子的时间，占整个营业时间百分之三十到百分之四十。现在，只要一个人介绍商品，其他人的全部时间都可节省出来进行营业。同时，因为分工明确，大家熟悉了业务，改进了工作。商品介绍员熟练地介绍各种商品，介绍展览式售货法的手续，使许多不识字的顾主也可随意购买；付货员按照商品代号付货，消灭了丢货串号的差错，因而实行“连带上班制”后因丢货差款而互相推诿责任的现象也克服了。
    展览式售货法实行成功后，顾主们非常满意，大家可很方便地买到各种商品，许多人高兴地问：是谁想到这个好法子？营业员们工作也正常了，以前，到星期日，绒衣圈要四个人临时帮助，才卖六百件，而且丢货串号现象相当严重；现在，不用别人帮忙，可卖八百五十件，但还没有像过去那样忙乱。根据第一商店实行的经验，长春市商业局正向市内百货系统进行推广。（冯潜）
