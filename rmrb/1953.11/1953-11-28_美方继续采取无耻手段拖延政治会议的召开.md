Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: Our special correspondent reports: In the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, the delaying tactics employed by the US representative Dean in recent days have reached a spectacular level. Dean stubbornly refuses to accept our side's three constructive proposals regarding the form and membership of the political conference, and instead engages in glib and nonsensical chatter, displaying the utmost frivolity and childishness. Dean's intention to delay is so obvious that even the US news agencies are openly discussing it. An Associated Press dispatch from Panmunjom on November 25th, in discussing the recent talks, admitted that "some observers" had "concluded from Dean's lengthy diatribe against Panmunjom as the conference site at the meeting on the 24th, which was simply ridiculous, that Dean was only trying to buy time." The Associated Press also admitted that Dean had made up his mind to "leave the main subject and not discuss the more fundamental peace conference issue, but instead engage in debate on the Russian issue." Today's meeting proved that Dean continued to entangle himself with the DPRK and Chinese representatives with hackneyed slanders against the Soviet Union.

However, Dean's delaying tactics are clearly not limited to these, and he has undoubtedly learned more tricks from Joye and Harrison. US news agencies have recently been constantly revealing Dean's plan to change to administrative meetings. As everyone knows, during the Korean armistice negotiations, whenever the US side's absurd arguments were refuted and could not stand up to scrutiny in the eyes of the world, they would demand an administrative meeting to avoid world opinion, and then continue to insist on their unreasonable demands in the administrative meeting. Dean's intention to request an administrative meeting again is clearly to avoid the condemnation of world opinion, so that he can more easily continue to employ his delaying tactics in secret meetings.

The Manila Far East Broadcasting Corporation also revealed today another delaying tactic that Dean may use. It is said that after "a reasonable period," Dean will set a deadline for the negotiations, giving the Communist side the choice of either agreeing to the time and place of the Korean conference or taking responsibility for sabotaging the conference. It can be seen from this news that Dean will force the DPRK and Chinese sides to accept the US side's unreasonable demands on the membership issue, otherwise he will put aside the membership issue and focus on wrangling over the time and place issues, and after a so-called "reasonable period," he will arbitrarily set a unilateral deadline for the negotiations, causing the negotiations to fail, thereby achieving the goal of indefinitely delaying the convening of the political conference.

The statement by the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, on November 25th, has already revealed how long this so-called "reasonable period" is. Lodge said that as long as the current negotiations in Panmunjom are still in progress, the United States opposes the United Nations discussing the Korean issue. Obviously, this so-called "reasonable" period is to drag on past the session of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly, and as far as possible until after January 22nd next year. By then, the United States can unilaterally deal with the more than 20,000 prisoners of war who have not yet received explanations, forcibly detain them, and can also freely interrupt the talks and force its "allies" to accept the fait accompli, just as the US side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations last October. The world cannot but pay serious attention to this American conspiracy.

### 美方继续采取无耻手段拖延政治会议的召开

    美方继续采取无耻手段拖延政治会议的召开
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中，美方代表迪安连日来所玩弄的拖延手法，已经到了蔚为大观的地步。迪安顽固地拒不接受我方关于政治会议的形式与成员问题的三点建设性建议，而一味油腔滑调地进行胡扯，极尽轻浮与儿戏之能事。迪安居心拖延的意图是如此明显，现在连美方通讯社也毫不隐讳地加以谈论。合众社板门店二十五日电在谈到最近几天的会谈情况时承认，“某些观察家”已从迪安在二十四日会议上反对板门店为会议地点的长篇废话中“得出了结论：迪安之所以开始提出他对板门店会谈的简直是滑稽的批评，不过是为了拖延时间罢了”。合众社还承认，迪安已打定主意，
  “离开正题，不谈较为根本的和平会议问题，而在俄国问题上展开论战”。今天的会议情况证明，迪安正是继续以诽谤苏联的陈词滥调来和朝中代表进行纠缠。
    但是，迪安的拖延手法，显然还不止这些，他无疑地已经从乔埃和哈利逊那里学来了更多的本领。美方通讯社最近不断透露，迪安正考虑改开行政性会议的计划。大家知道，在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，美方每当自己的一切荒谬论点都被驳倒、在全世界注视下站不住脚了的时候，就要求举行行政性会议，避开世界舆论，然后在行政性会议中继续坚持其无理主张。迪安打算再次要求举行行政性会议，显然是为了躲避世界舆论的谴责，以便在秘密会议中更加方便地继续施展其拖延伎俩。
    马尼拉远东广播公司今天还透露了迪安可能使用的另一个拖延手法。据说，在经过“一个合理的时期以后，迪安将为谈判订出一个期限，让共方选择要就是同意朝鲜会议的时间和地点，要就是承担破坏会议的责任”。从这个消息可以看出，迪安将强迫朝中方面接受美方在成员问题上的无理主张，否则他将撇开成员问题不谈，专在时间和地点问题上进行纠缠，并且在经过所谓“合理的时期”以后，就蛮横地为谈判订出一个片面期限，使谈判趋于失败，从而达到无限期拖延召开政治会议的目的。
    美国驻联合国代表洛奇二十五日的声明中已经透露这个所谓“合理的时期”究竟有多长。洛奇说，只要目前在板门店举行的谈判还在进行，美国就反对联合国讨论朝鲜问题。显然，这个所谓“合理的”时期就是拖过第八届联合国大会的会期，并且尽可能拖到明年一月二十二日以后。到那时候，美国既可以片面地处理二万多名尚未听解释的战俘，强迫把他们扣留；又可以放手中断会谈，用既成事实来强迫它的“盟国”接受，就像美方在去年十月片面中断停战谈判一样。对于美国的这一阴谋，全世界不能不予以严重的注意。
