To explore the rich heritage of folk music and art, the Yangzhou Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized music workers and Yang Opera performers in the city this summer to jointly organize Yang Opera melodies. More than fifty melodies have been organized, of which twenty-eight have been carefully proofread and printed into a research edition. In the process of sorting out, each melody went through repeated singing, playing, notation, accompaniment, and comparison before the final draft was finalized. Individual pieces were also corrected by folk Qingqu artists. Through this sorting out, many good tunes in Yang Opera that had long been abandoned, such as "Xiangjiang Waves" and "Lujiang Lament," were discovered.

    扬州音乐工作者及扬剧艺人整理扬剧曲调
    为了发掘民间音乐艺术的丰富遗产，扬州市文联于今年夏天组织了该市音乐工作者及扬剧艺人，联合进行扬剧曲调整理工作。经过整理的曲调共有五十多首，其中现已有二十八首经过详细校正印成了研究本。在整理过程中，每一曲调都经反复唱奏、记谱、伴奏、对照等步骤才最后定稿，个别曲子并聘请了民间清曲家共同订正。经过这次整理，扬剧中久已废弃不用，但却是很好的曲调，如“湘江浪”、“芦江怨”等，都被发现了。
