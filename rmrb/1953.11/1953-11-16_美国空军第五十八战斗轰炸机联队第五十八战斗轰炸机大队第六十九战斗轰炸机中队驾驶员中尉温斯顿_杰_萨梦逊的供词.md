　　Confession of First Lieutenant Winston J. Sampleson, Pilot of the 69th Bombardment Squadron, 58th Bombardment Group, 58th Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force
　　I am Winston J. Sampleson, First Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-2223176, born in Iowa on January 30, 1929, joined the Air Force on January 2, 1952. Arrived at Itazuke, Japan on July 10, 1952, arrived at Taegu, Korea on July 15, 1952, and was assigned to the 69th Squadron of the 58th Bombardment Group of the 58th Bombardment Wing. My primary job was flight leader, and secondary job was pilot. I was captured on March 1, 1953, south of Kimcheon, North Korea.
　　On July 11, 1952, at Itazuke, Japan, all new pilots listened to a brief welcome speech given by Colonel Baker, commander of the 58th Wing. He mentioned that we would be performing the following types of flight missions: forward air support missions, attack missions, rescue missions, and bacteriological missions. Based on this conversation, we received several lectures to familiarize ourselves with germ warfare and understand it in order to carry out missions.
　　At approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 12, 1952, Second Lieutenants (later promoted to First Lieutenants) McKinney, Roberts, Shafen, Kimmelso, Bustin, and myself, along with the remaining three whom I have forgotten, reported to the operations room to receive the first of three lectures. Our instructor was Lieutenant Barlow. He told us why the United States was engaging in bacteriological warfare and emphasized that we would continue bacteriological warfare until we achieved the results we desired.
　　At approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 13, 1952, we were given a brief history lesson on bacteriological warfare. As far as I can remember, the course mentioned that the United States began developing bacteriological warfare after the last war. The Japanese had already engaged in this work, and we continued and developed their work. He also talked about developing various types of germ bombs over the years, but I don't remember the details of this part of the course.
　　In the latter part of the lecture, he mentioned that there were two types of germ bombs that we would encounter in the 58th Bombardment Group. One looks like a 500-pound demolition bomb with a small amount of explosive inside. This germ bomb explodes upon impact and scatters the germs. The other is a non-explosive "door-type" germ bomb, which has several sets of doors around it.
　　Both bombs contain the same thing, either a solution containing germs (I don't remember the exact name) or germ-carrying insects. As far as I can remember, these insects were fleas, flies, mosquitoes, and lice, which transmit the following pathogens: cholera, typhus, yellow fever, etc.
　　He said that "door-type" germ bombs are not used on jet aircraft, and we will currently use 500-pound explosive germ bombs. He also said that in the future we will use newly developed bacteriological weapons. At the time, he explained to us that there was no need to fear whether germs would be transmitted from the bombs because they were sealed to prevent this from happening.
　　At approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 14, 1952, we took our last lesson, in which we talked about the tactics of dropping germ bombs. He said that dropping germ bombs was almost the same as dropping ordinary bombs.
　　Generally speaking, on the way from the base to the target, we fly at an altitude of 25,000 feet. About five minutes from the target, we begin to descend to about 9,000 feet, and we drop the bombs at about 4,500 feet. If the target is not too far from the base, we fly at a lower altitude so as not to damage the effectiveness of the bomb. We must always fly as low as possible. He emphasized that when dropping germ bombs, we must be as accurate as possible.
　　If you absolutely cannot complete the germ warfare mission midway, drop your germ bombs in the "safe" location of the sea surface ten to fifteen miles outside of Pohang Harbor. He said that the targets of germ warfare missions are troop concentrations, supply areas, streams, and reservoirs.
　　Finally, he said: For the sake of secrecy, we should not talk to anyone about this material.
　　During these three days, one group took classes in the morning, and another group received the same course in the afternoon. I remember that the pilots who took classes in the afternoon were Second Lieutenants Patterson, Rogge Warren, and Carle, and I don't remember the rest.
　　On July 15, 1952, I arrived at K-2 Air Base in Korea. On July 16, 1952, all the new pilots from Itazuke received a welcome from Colonel Sharpe. He told us about the types of missions we were to carry out. When he touched on bacteriological type missions, he claimed that he himself also performed these missions, because it was part of his and our job, and he was convinced that we would also do our best to do these jobs well.
　　On the afternoons of July 17 and 18, 1952, all the pilots, whom I remember as Second Lieutenants McKinney, Roberts, Shafen, Kimmelso, Bustin, Patterson, Rogge Warren, Curtis Carle, and myself, plus a few others, received two germ warfare lectures from Lieutenant Byondo. Most of the content of these courses repeated what we had heard in Itazuke, Japan. He mainly emphasized tactics and also emphasized how the group was conducting germ warfare.
　　On October 9, 1952, Major Charles, Second Lieutenant Rogge Warren, Lieutenant Scott, Lieutenant Martin, myself, Lieutenant Pichi, and Reagan, along with four others whose names I can't remember, all reported to the Group Operations Room to participate in the briefing at around 7:30 a.m. We were all a little shocked when we were all seated and looked at the briefing board, which showed our flight routes, altitudes, times, and target locations. The target was inside Manchuria, north of a city called Jian.
　　Briefing officer Lieutenant Kesman announced that the target was about four to five miles north of Jian, Manchuria. He said that the flight routes and times were correct and should be followed exactly. A total of twelve aircraft were dispatched for this mission, each carrying two germ bombs. Lieutenant Kesman said, "You will have F-86 cover as added protection for this mission," "There will be twenty-four F-86s patrolling along the Yalu River, and you will have another twelve as your close cover," "These twelve F-86s will meet you near Heechon." He said that the altitude at which we would fly to the target was 25,000 feet, and we would begin to descend about five minutes from the target. The covering F-86s would descend with us, covering us all the way to the target and covering us back south to Heechon. Lieutenant Kesman then synchronized the time with us, thus ending his briefing.
　　Lieutenant Norris then briefed us in this way: "Gentlemen, today's target we believe to be a concentration point for troops and supplies," "This area is also a transit point for personnel and equipment entering North Korea, so many troops pass through Jian and its surrounding areas," "For this reason, we are using germ bombs here to achieve the greatest effect," "If we succeed in thoroughly contaminating this area, then the Communists will have to establish another supply and transit point." Intelligence Officer Lieutenant Norris gave us this information and also said that we must be accurate when dropping bombs.
　　The meteorologist then briefed us, giving us the general weather conditions. After the ground liaison officer gave us the front-line situation, mission leader Major Charles issued his briefing.
　　Finally, Lieutenant Martin gave a short briefing to our squadron.
　　We took off at 9:30 a.m., found the F-86 aircraft group in the Heechon area, arrived at the target on time, and found it without difficulty. Before we reached the Yalu River, I saw the river, and soon the city of Jian appeared. Everything went smoothly. I saw a small group of houses and made a good bombing run. I left the target and immediately found Martin. The squadron quickly regrouped, and the F-86s covered us all the way to Heechon. After landing, we reported to Lieutenant Norris and filled out the secret reporting forms.
　　The next mission or series of missions that I have chosen to talk about were carried out between approximately January 11 and 15, 1953. In the days before these dates, Colonel Watford had attended a Wing Commander's meeting in Seoul, so we all had an idea that something big was about to happen.
　　Around January 11, 1953, we received a briefing at 6:30 a.m. Briefing officer Lieutenant Nicholson began the briefing in this way, saying: "Gentlemen, this morning you are going to Sinuiju to destroy the bridges there," "This is a joint mission of the Fifth Air Force, and all groups will participate in this attack," "The flight routes and times on the briefing board are correct."
　　Lieutenant Norris then briefed us, emphasizing the importance of this mission and telling us that we must be careful to do this work well. The meteorologist and the ground liaison officer followed the usual procedures and gave their individual briefings.
　　After the briefing, Lieutenant Norris spoke to Lieutenant Quixie's squadron and my squadron as follows:
　　"You two squadrons will carry one demolition bomb and one germ bomb on this mission," "Your primary target is the anti-aircraft gun positions assigned to you, and remember, you must make every effort to destroy them," "The germ bomb is being taken to be dropped in the hope that the spread of disease will delay the reconstruction of these bridges," "You are to drop these bombs individually, first dropping the demolition bomb on the anti-aircraft gun positions, and then dropping the germ bomb on the general area."
　　Major Atwood explained the tactics we were to use, and then I briefed my squadron.
　　We took off at 8:30 a.m. and arrived at the target on time. You could see planes everywhere. I led my squadron, entered the target assigned to us, and dropped our bombs as briefed. I left the target and flew to the left. My squadron quickly regrouped and began to climb back to base. I had to be very careful because there were many planes coming from the opposite direction and flying towards the target. After we landed, we reported to Lieutenant Norris to give our report.
　　I carried out a total of four germ warfare missions to Sinuiju, and the procedure was similar each time.
　　On the morning of February 15, 1953, Major Atwood, Lieutenant Drews, Lieutenant Kelly, myself, Lieutenant Bacon, Lieutenant Carnos, and Lieutenant Polieu, plus others whose names I can't remember, all went to report for briefing. Lieutenant Kesman began in this way: "Gentlemen, today's target is north of Chosan, about three miles across the Yalu River, just inside Chinese Manchuria," "The times and routes listed on the bulletin board are correct," "This mission has thirty-two aircraft, eight of which are carrying two germ bombs each, and the other twenty-four are carrying ordinary bombs," "Major Atwood's squadron and Lieutenant Sampleson's squadron are carrying germ bombs," "There are sixteen F-86s patrolling along the Yalu River, and another twelve providing close cover for you."
　　Lieutenant Norris then issued a briefing, saying: "Gentlemen, the target is located in Manchuria, China, about three miles north of the Yalu River," "We believe that there are large quantities of supplies and some troops nearby," "We are using germ bombs in order to maximize their effectiveness," "We want you to drop the germ bombs in the rural area between many houses."
　　We took off as briefed and arrived at the target at approximately 2:50 p.m. I saw the countryside through the thin clouds, and we entered the attack, dropping our germ bombs as briefed. I assembled the squadron as quickly as possible and flew to K-2 base. After landing, we went through the procedures with Lieutenant Norris and completed our standard report. The reporting forms were secret, and we signed our names to acknowledge this fact.
　　From August 1952 to March 1953, I flew a total of ninety-six combat missions in North Korea and China, sixteen of which were germ missions.
　　On the following dates, I dropped two germ bombs on each target.
　　August 22, 1952, Sariwon, North Korea.
　　September 14, 1952, east of Chinampo, North Korea.
　　September 18, 1952, northeast of Kainei, North Korea.
　　October 4, 1952, the countryside northwest of Pyongyang.
　　October 9, 1952, four to five miles north of Jian, Manchuria.
　　October 20, 1952, Hwangju, North Korea.
　　November 20, 1952, the countryside about two miles north of Osan-ri, North Korea.
　　December 1, 1952, a village ten to twelve miles southwest of Wonsan.
　　January 7, 1953, Seipo-ri, North Korea.
　　February 15, 1953, three miles north of the Yalu River, inside Manchuria, China.
　　Between January 11 and 15, 1953, I carried out four missions, dropping one germ bomb each time on Sinuiju, North Korea.
　　The 58th Bombardment Wing began carrying out night combat missions around the end of November 1952. Our group dispatched eight aircraft every night or every two nights, depending on the orders of the Fifth Air Force Headquarters and the weather conditions. The eight aircraft flew out singly every ten to thirty minutes. About two of the eight carried germ bombs. As far as I know, there were two types of bacteriological weapons being used at that time: ordinary explosive germ bombs and a spray-type bacteriological weapon.
　　I dropped one germ bomb on Sinuiju, North Korea on December 20, 1952, and one germ bomb south of Heechon, North Korea on January 12, 1953.
　　Spreading disease by means of bacteriological warfare is a terrible thing that I loathed participating in. I think they should be considered illegal by all countries. I will never understand why the United States would use this method of destruction to wage war, especially a war in Korea that has nothing to do with our country.

　　美国空军第五十八战斗轰炸机联队第五十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十九战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉温斯顿·杰·萨梦逊的供词
    我是温斯顿·杰·萨梦逊，美国空军中尉，军号ＡＯ—２２２３１７６，一九二九年一月三十日生于衣阿华州，一九五二年一月二日参加空军。一九五二年七月十日抵达日本板付，一九五二年七月十五日抵达朝鲜大邱，被分配在第五十八战斗轰炸机联队第五十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十九中队。我的主要工作是小队长，次要工作是驾驶员。一九五三年三月一日我在北朝鲜金城南部被俘。
    一九五二年七月十一日在日本板付，所有新的驾驶员听取了第五十八联队长贝克上校对我们所作的简短的欢迎词。他提到我们将要执行下列类型的飞行任务：前线空援任务、袭击任务、营救任务以及细菌类型的任务。基于这次谈话，为了熟悉细菌战，对它有所了解，以便执行任务，我们接受了几堂讲课。
    一九五二年七月十二日约在八点钟，少尉阶级的（后提升为中尉）麦金尼、罗伯茨、沙芬、基麦尔苏尔、布斯丁和我自己，以及我已忘记的其余三位，向作战室报到，接受三堂讲课中的第一课。我们的教官是巴洛中尉。他告诉我们为什么美国要从事于细菌战，并强调我们将继续细菌战直至得到我们所期望的结果时为止。
    一九五二年七月十三日约在八点钟，我们被授予细菌战争简史课。据我记忆所及，课程中提到美国是在上次大战后开始发展细菌战的。日本人早已从事于此种工作，而我们继续并发展他们的工作。他还谈到多年来发展各种各样的细菌弹，但是我记不得课中这部分的细节。
    在讲课的后一部分，他提到有两种类型的细菌弹，我们将会在第五十八战斗轰炸机大队接触到。一种外型像五百磅型爆破炸弹，有很少量炸药在里面。这种细菌弹在触地时爆炸，并把细菌散布出去。另一种是不爆炸的“门型”细菌弹，这种细菌弹在周围装有几套门。
    这两种炸弹里面装着同样的东西，或者是带细菌的溶液（我记不清确实的名字），或者是带菌昆虫。据我记忆所及，这些昆虫是跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子和虱子，传染下列病菌：霍乱、斑疹伤寒、黄热病等。
    他说“门型”细菌弹不用于喷气式飞机，目前我们将使用五百磅爆炸型细菌弹。他还说在将来我们要使用新发展的细菌武器。当时，他对我们解释无需乎畏惧病菌是否从炸弹中传染出来。因为他们被密闭起来，以防止这种情况的发生。
    一九五二年七月十四日约八点钟，我们上了最后一堂课，课中我们谈到投掷细菌弹的战术。他说投掷细菌弹与投掷一般炸弹差不多相同。
    一般说来由基地飞往目标的途中，我们在二万五千英尺的高空飞行，离目标五分钟左右，我们开始下降到约九千英尺，我们至四千五百英尺左右投弹。假如目标离基地不太远的话，为了不致损害炸弹的效力，我们飞较低的高度。我们时时要尽可能低飞。他强调在投细菌弹时，我们必须尽可能的准确。
    假如你们在细菌战任务中途一定不能完成的话，把你们的细菌弹投在浦项港外十到十五英里的海面“安全”地点。他说细菌战任务的目标是军队集结地、供应区，溪流和蓄水池。
    最后，他说：为了保密的缘故，我们不要和任何人谈论这种材料。
    在这三天中，在上午上课，另外一组在下午接受同样的课程。我记得在下午上课的驾驶员们是少尉阶级的派特逊、罗吉·华伦、卡莱，其余的人我已不记得。
    一九五二年七月十五日，我抵达朝鲜Ｋ—２空军基地。一九五二年七月十六日所有从板付来的新驾驶员接受夏尔普上校的欢迎。他告诉我们关于我们所要执行的任务的类型，在他涉及细菌类型任务时，他声称他自己也执行这种任务，因为这是他和我们工作的一部分，他深信我们也会尽力把这些工作作好。
    一九五二年七月十七日和十八两日的下午，所有的驾驶员，我所记得的有少尉阶级的麦金尼、罗伯茨、沙芬、基麦尔苏尔、布斯丁、派特逊、罗吉·华伦、柯蒂斯·卡莱和我自己，再加上其他几个人，接受拜昂多中尉所授予的两堂细菌战讲课。这些课程的大部分内容是重复我们已在日本板付所听过的。他主要强调战术，并且也强调大队是如何在进行细菌战。
    一九五二年十月九日，夏雷少校、罗吉·华伦少尉、斯各特中尉、马丁中尉、我自己、皮契中尉和里根，以及记不起名字的另四个人都向大队作战室报到，参加上午七时三十分左右的简令。当我们都已坐好，并看了一下写着我们的飞行路线、高度、时间、目标位置的简令板时，我们都有些震惊了。目标是在满洲境内，在一个叫辑安城的北面。
    简令官凯斯曼中尉宣布目标是在满洲辑安以北约四到五英里处。他说飞行路线和时间是正确的，应该确实的依照执行。这次任务共出动十二架飞机，每架携带细菌弹二枚。凯斯曼中尉说：“这次任务你们将有Ｆ—８６掩护作为外加的保护”，“沿鸭绿江将有二十四架Ｆ—８６巡逻，而你们将另有十二架作为你们紧密的掩护”，“这十二架Ｆ—８６将于熙川附近与你们相遇。”他说我们飞向目标的高度是二万五千英尺，在距目标约五分钟时开始下降。作掩护的Ｆ—８６和我们一起下降，掩护我们一直到目标，并掩护我们回来南至熙川。凯斯曼中尉然后和我们对时，这样结束了他的简令。
    诺里斯中尉接着用这种方式向我们作简令：“诸位，今天的目标我们相信是一个军队和供应品的集结处”，“这个地区也是将人员和装备输入北朝鲜的输送点，故有许多军队经过辑安及其周围地区”，“为了这个原因我们正在这里使用细菌弹以求得最大的效果”，“假如我们成功地彻底沾染这个地区，那么共产党将必须设立另一补给和输送点了”。情报官诺里斯中尉给予我们这种情报，并且也说到我们在投弹时必须准确。
    气象官接着作简令，授予我们一般的天气情况。在地面联络官给予我们前线的情况后，任务领队夏雷少校发布他的简令。
    最后马丁中尉对我们小队作了简短的简令。
    我们上午九时半起飞，在熙川地区找到Ｆ—８６机群并按时到达目标，而且没有困难的找到了它。在我们到达鸭绿江前，我就看到了江，很快的辑安城就出现了。每一件事都进行得很顺利，我看到了一小群房子，并作了一次很好的投弹飞行，我离开了目标并马上找到了马丁，小队又很快的集合起来，Ｆ—８６掩护我们一直到熙川。着陆后，我们向诺里斯中尉汇报，并填好秘密汇报表格。
    我选择出来要谈的下一次任务或一串任务大约是在一九五三年一月十一日至十五日之间执行的。在这些日子的前数天，华福特上校曾在汉城参加联队长会议，所以我们都有一个想法，认为有什么大事情要发生了。
    约一九五三年一月十一日，我们在上午六时三十分接受简令。简令官尼科尔逊中尉以这种方式开始简令，他说：“诸位，今天早晨你们将去新安州摧毁那里的桥梁”，“这是第五航空队的联合任务，所有大队都将参与这次攻击”，“在简令板上的飞行路线和时间都是对的”。
    诺里斯中尉接着简令，他强调这次任务的重要性，并叫我们必须当心做好这个工作。气象官和地面联络官按照平时的程序，他们个别的作了简令。
    在简令结束后，诺里斯中尉对屈西中尉的小队和我的小队作如下的讲话：
    “你们两个小队在这次任务中将要携带一枚爆破弹和一枚细菌弹”，“你们的主要目标是指派给你们的高射炮阵地，记住，必须要尽一切的努力去摧毁它”，“细菌弹被带去投掷是希望疾病的蔓延将会延缓这些桥梁的重建”，“你们要单个的投下这些炸弹，先将爆破弹投在高射炮阵地，然后将细菌弹投在一般地区上”。
    爱特伍德少校说明我们所要使用的战术，然后我对我的小队作简令。
    我们在八时三十分起飞，按时到达目标。到处你都能见到飞机。我带领了我的小队，进入指派给我们的目标，我们按简令投下了我们的炸弹。我离开目标飞向左方，我的小队很快的重新集合起来，就开始上升返回基地。我必须非常注意，因为有许多飞机，从对方飞来，飞向目标去。我们着陆后就向诺里斯中尉报到进行汇报。
    我总共执行了四次去新安州的细菌战任务，每一次的程序都相似。
    一九五三年二月十五日上午，爱特伍德少校、德鲁斯中尉、凯利中尉、我自己、培根中尉、卡诺斯中尉及波留中尉，外加其他我已记不得他们名字的人，都去报到接受简令。凯斯曼中尉以这种方式开始：“诸位，今天的目标是楚山以北，越过鸭绿江约三英里，恰在中国的满洲境内”，“在布告板上所列的时间与路线是正确的”，“这次任务有三十二架飞机，其中八架每架携带两枚细菌弹，其他二十四架携带普通炸弹”，“爱特伍德少校的小队和萨梦逊中尉的小队携带细菌弹”，“有十六架Ｆ—８６沿鸭绿江巡逻，另有十二架紧密掩护你们”。
    诺里斯中尉接着发布简令说：“诸位，目标是位于满洲境内鸭绿江以北约三英里”，“我们相信那里附近有大量的补给品及一些军队”，“我们为了发挥最大的效能而使用细菌弹”，“我们要你们将细菌弹投中乡村地区许多房屋之间”。
    我们按简令起飞，约于十四时五十分到达目标。我通过薄薄的云层看到该乡村，我们就进入攻击，按简令投下我们的细菌弹。我尽可能快地集合了小队。飞向Ｋ—２基地。着陆后，我们和诺里斯中尉办理手续，完成了我们的标准汇报。汇报的表格是秘密的，我们签了名，来承认这事实。
    自一九五二年八月至一九五三年三月我在北朝鲜和中国共执行了九十六次飞行战斗任务，其中十六次是细菌任务。
    在下列日期中，我在每一目标上，投了两枚细菌弹。
    一九五二年八月二十二日，北朝鲜沙里院。
    一九五二年九月十四日，北朝鲜镇南浦之东。
    一九五二年九月十八日，北朝鲜兼二浦之东北。
    一九五二年十月四日，平壤西北的乡村。
    一九五二年十月九日，满洲辑安之北四至五英里。
    一九五二年十月二十日，北朝鲜黄州。
    一九五二年十一月二十日，北朝鲜梧山里之北约二英里之乡村。
    一九五二年十二月一日，元山西南十至十二英里的村庄。
    一九五三年一月七日，北朝鲜洗浦里。
    一九五三年二月十五日，中国满洲境内鸭绿江以北三英里。
    在一九五三年一月十一日至十五日之间，我执行过四次任务，每次投细菌弹一枚于北朝鲜新安州。
    第五十八战斗轰炸机联队约于一九五二年十一月底开始执行夜间战斗任务。我们大队每晚或每两晚出动八架飞机，依第五航空队司令部命令和气象情况而定，该八架飞机每隔十至三十分钟，单机飞出。八架之中约有两架携带细菌弹。据我所知，当时有两种细菌武器被应用：普通爆炸型细菌弹和一种喷射型细菌武器。
    我于一九五二年十二月二十日，在北朝鲜新安州投细菌弹一枚，于一九五三年一月十二日在北朝鲜熙川以南投细菌弹一枚。
    用细菌战散布疾病，是我所厌恶参加的一种可怕的事情。我想他们应被所有的国家认为非法。我永远也不会了解为什么美国要用这种毁灭方法来进行战争，特别是一个在朝鲜进行的与我国毫不相干的战争。
