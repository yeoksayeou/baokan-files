    Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: Professor Ikua Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, distinguished Japanese public figure, and winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, met with reporters in Beijing on the 16th to deliver a speech on issues such as the Japanese peace movement.

    Ikua Oyama first spoke about the peace movement in Japan. He said: Since the establishment of the Japan Peace Committee, the peace movement in Japan has been continuously developing over the past few years. Although the Japanese government has attempted to suppress it through various means, the forces for peace are still growing. Now, vast sections of the population across Japan, from workers and farmers to cultural and business figures, are extremely concerned about the peace movement. While the United States continues to occupy Japan, an increasing number of Japanese people demanding national independence are joining the ranks of defending peace. Ikua Oyama then said: The Japanese peace movement, as part of the world peace movement, is working to prevent a new war, just like the international peace movement. At the same time, American imperialism still occupies Japan today and has concluded the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" with the Japanese government, rearming Japan and turning Japan into a military base, attempting to invade Asia and dominate the world. In response to this situation, the Japanese people have launched a struggle against rearmament and against military bases. This is the characteristic of the Japanese people's struggle to defend peace, and this is the path the Japanese people should take. At the same time, opposition to various reactionary bills that restrict the people's political and freedom of speech, and opposition to repressive measures against the people, such as fabricating the "Matsukawa Incident," have also become important components of the Japanese people's struggle for peace. Recently, this movement has grown stronger, particularly manifested in the Japanese people's demand to restore normal relations with China, the Soviet Union, and other countries.

    Further discussing the Japanese people's opposition to the United States rearming Japan, Ikua Oyama said that vast sections of the Japanese population have launched a movement against rearmament, and have also launched a movement against the revival of military economy and demanding the establishment of a peaceful economy, hoping to carry out economic exchanges with China and countries around the world. He described in detail the opposition of Japanese students and cultural figures to rearmament. He said that Japanese students, together with workers and farmers, are launching a movement against conscription, defending normal academic research, and opposing military bases, and have achieved great results. Japanese cultural figures have also joined the movement against rearmament. They have risen up with people from all walks of life to oppose the American trampling of Japanese culture, defend national heritage, and protect human rights and freedom. They are united around the "Japan Cultural People's Conference" to fight against the forced import of imperialist culture.

    During the interview with reporters, Ikua Oyama gladly spoke about his impressions of his visits to the Soviet Union and China. He said: The strongest feeling is that the economic construction and people's lives in the Soviet Union and China are filled with an atmosphere of peace. During my time in the Soviet Union and China, I deeply felt the profound friendship and trust and expectations of the Soviet and Chinese people towards the Japanese people. This situation will greatly encourage the Japanese people, and make the Japanese people work harder to further unite with the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the Korean people, and the people of the world to fight for peace.

    [Further News] Professor Ikua Oyama, his wife, and Tadashi Dan, a member of the World Peace Council, left Beijing by plane on the morning of the 17th to attend the World Peace Council meeting in Vienna. Among those who went to see them off was Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

    大山郁夫离京前对记者发表谈话
    日本人民反对重新武装的和平运动广泛展开
    【新华社十六日讯】日本拥护和平委员会主席、杰出的日本公众领袖、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人大山郁夫教授，于十六日在北京接见新闻记者，发表有关日本的和平运动等问题的谈话。
    大山郁夫首先谈到了日本的和平运动。他说：自从日本拥护和平委员会成立后，几年来日本的和平运动在不断发展着。日本政府虽然企图用各种手段来镇压，但和平的力量仍然在增涨，现在日本全国各地广大阶层，从工人、农民到文化界、工商界人士，都对和平运动极为关心。在美国继续占领日本的同时，越来越多的要求民族独立的日本人民涌进了保卫和平的行列。大山郁夫接着说：作为世界和平运动一部分的日本和平运动，和国际规模的和平运动一样，正在为防止新战争而努力。同时，美帝国主义今天仍然占领着日本，并和日本政府缔结了旧金山“和约”和“美日安全保障条约”，重新武装日本和使日本军事基地化，想要侵略亚洲并称霸世界；针对着这种情况，日本人民展开了反对重新武装与反对军事基地化的斗争，这就是日本人民保卫和平的斗争的特点，这也是日本人民应走的道路。同时，反对限制人民政治、言论自由的各种反动法案和反对制造“松川事件”等镇压人民的措施，也成为日本人民争取和平运动的重要内容。最近，这一运动更加壮大起来，特别是表现在日本人民要求和中国及苏联等国恢复正常关系上。
    在进一步谈到日本人民反对美国重新武装日本的情况时，大山郁夫说，日本广大阶层人民已展开了反对重新武装的运动，同时也展开了反对复活军事经济、要求建立和平经济的运动，希望和中国及世界各国展开经济交流。他详细地叙述了日本学生和文化界人士反对重新武装的情况。他说，日本学生和工人、农民一起，正在展开反对征兵、保卫正常的学术研究和反对军事基地化的运动，并得到了很大的成果。日本文化界人士也投入反对重整军备的运动中，他们和各阶层人民一道，起来反对美国蹂躏日本文化、保卫民族遗产和人权自由。他们团结在“日本文化人会议”的周围，为反对强迫输入帝国主义文化而斗争。
    在接见记者时，大山郁夫欣然谈到了他这次访问苏联和中国的观感。他说：感觉最强烈的是：苏联和中国的经济建设和人民生活都充满着和平的气象。在苏联和中国的期间，我深深地感到了苏联人民和中国人民对日本人民的深厚友谊以及信赖和期待。这种情况必将大大地鼓舞日本人民，使日本人民更加努力地和中国人民、苏联人民及朝鲜人民以及全世界人民进一步的团结起来，为争取和平而斗争。
    【又讯】大山郁夫教授和他的夫人及世界和平理事会理事淡德三郎，已于十七日晨乘飞机离北京赴维也纳参加世界和平理事会会议。前往欢送的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若等。
