This is the American Way of Life

    Forging Voter Lists
    The New York City mayoral election is scheduled to begin on November 3rd. In the run-up to the election, candidates such as the incumbent mayor, Vincent Impellitteri, Republican Ruth Reigelman, and Democrat Robert Wagner, engaged in bribery and mutual attacks to win votes, creating a chaotic atmosphere in New York. At the height of the heated campaign, it was suddenly revealed that 78 percent of the 24,000 signatures on the petition nominating Impellitteri as a mayoral candidate were forged. No wonder New York citizens were so indifferent to this so-called election. This year, the number of registered voters in New York City decreased by 1.1 million compared to last year.

    Persecution of Teachers
    TASS New York Dispatch: Recently, many states in the United States have passed special laws stipulating that every teacher must take a "loyalty oath," and schools cannot hire any teacher whose "loyalty" is under "reasonable suspicion." The Un-American Activities Committee of California recently investigated thousands of staff members in Los Angeles schools to determine their "loyalty." The Board of Regents of Colorado State University quietly dismissed eight university teachers and conducted "loyalty investigations" on five others. The New York State Board of Regents announced a decision on September 24, publicly banning progressives from teaching in schools. In the United States, if a teacher is summoned to a congressional investigation committee and refuses to answer any provocative questions, they will be immediately dismissed.

    Child Drug Addiction
    American rulers are poisoning the younger generation of Americans with drugs and narcotics, causing children to become demoralized and morally degraded from an early age, making it easier for Wall Street to rule. According to the book "America in 1953" by Derick Cardon, there are 1,500 child drug addicts in New York City alone, and 300 child drug addicts were discovered in Chicago in one month. Child drug addiction has become a common concern for parents in most American cities.
    American novelist Nelson Algren reported on the situation of an 18-year-old drug addict, saying that an American judge asked the child, "What do you do all day?" The 18-year-old drug addict said, "I lean. I find an alley or a toilet and take a hit. Then I keep leaning. I just lean, fantasizing." Another girl told Algren, "Morphine is like God. It occupies a position in one's heart that can never be forgotten."

    "Robbery" Practice
    According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on September 2nd: In a grocery store in Oklahoma City, USA, one day, a large man suddenly burst in, his right hand in his pocket, as if he were about to pull out a pistol, threatening the grocery store staff: "Quick, give me all the money in the till!" After the grocery store cashier opened the till, the large man smiled and said: "Forget it! I don't have a gun, I just wanted to see if robbery is as easy as the newspapers say!"

    Selling Dilapidated Houses
    As long as it makes money, there are people in the United States doing all kinds of businesses. TASS October 20th dispatch, quoting a report from the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," said that sellers of dilapidated houses in slums in New York City have been very active recently, and they can make a lot of money in an instant under the protection of American law. In the Brooklyn slum in the black area of New York, a house valued at $3,000 can be sold for $7,500, and can be sold for $11,000 after one more transaction. Another house worth $4,200 can make a profit of $8,300 after two transactions.
    This kind of business does not require much cost. Some houses only need to be slightly repaired, and some can even carry out their speculative activities and obtain huge profits without any repairs at all. Therefore, even "respectable people" in New York City are engaged in this career.

    Crime Cases Break Records
    The domestic crime situation in the United States reached an unprecedentedly bad record in the first half of this year. According to records recently released by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, a total of 1,047,290 major crimes occurred in the six months from January 1st to July 1st this year, an increase of 2.5 percent compared to the same period last year. And last year's crime figures were already record-breaking figures. The classifications of crime cases in the first half of this year listed by the FBI are as follows: 6,470 murders, 8,860 rapes, 29,610 robberies, 45,630 intentional murder assaults, 844,120 thefts, and 112,600 car thefts. On average, someone is murdered, raped, or subjected to an intentional murder assault every 4.3 minutes in the United States. These are of course only the figures that have been recorded and officially announced.

    这就是美国生活方式
    私造选民名单
    纽约市长选举订于十一月三日开始。在选举前夕，候选人如原来的市长森特·英佩利特里、共和党的罗特·雷格曼和民主党的罗伯特·华格纳等人，为了骗取选票，他们就大肆贿赂，彼此攻击，弄得纽约乌烟瘴气。正在竞选得十分火热的时候，忽然揭露出提名英佩利特里为市长候选人的两万四千人签名的请求书上，竟有百分之七十八的签名都是假造的。无怪纽约市民对这次所谓选举那么冷淡。今年纽约市参加选民登记的人比去年减少了一百一十万人。
    迫害教师
    据塔斯社纽约电讯报道，最近在美国许多州都通过了一条特别法律，规定每一个教师必须要参加“忠诚宣誓”，如果有任何教师的“忠诚”受到“合理怀疑”，各校就都不能聘用。加利福尼亚州的非美活动委员会最近曾在洛杉矶的学校中，调查了数千工作人员是否“忠诚”；科罗拉多州立大学的评议委员会，曾不声不响地将八个大学教师解了职，并对另外五个教师进行了“忠诚调查”；纽约州评议委员会曾于九月二十四日公布了一个决定，公开禁止进步分子在学校任教。在美国，教师如果被传到国会调查委员会里去，又拒绝答复任何一个挑衅性的问题，他们就会立刻被解聘。
    儿童吸毒
    美国统治者正在用毒品、麻醉物来毒害美国年青的一代，使儿童们从小就意志消沉，道德沦丧，更便于华尔街的统治。据德里克·卡东所著“一九五三年的美国”一书统计：仅在纽约市就有一千五百个儿童吸食毒品，芝加哥在一个月内就发现了三百个吸毒的儿童。儿童吸毒，已成为美国大多数城市中做父母的普遍苦恼的问题。
    美国小说家纳尔逊·阿尔格林报告一个十八岁的吸毒者的情况说，美国法官问这个孩子：“你整天做些什么？”十八岁的吸毒者说：“我斜靠着。我找一个过道或厕所，抽上一口。然后我仍斜靠着。我只是斜靠着，幻想着。”还有一个女孩子对阿尔格林说：“吗啡同上帝一样。它在一个人的心田中占有永远忘记不了的地位。”
      “抢劫”演习
    据九月二日伦敦“工人日报”报道：在美国奥克拉荷马市的一家杂货店里，有一天，突然有一个大汉撞了进来，他的右手插在口袋里，好像要掏手枪似地，对杂货店的人威胁道：“快把钱柜里的钱统统给我拿出来！”等到杂货店的帐房把钱柜打开之后，大汉才微笑说：“算了吧！我没有枪，我只是想试试看，抢劫是不是像报上常说的那样容易吧了！”
     贩卖破房屋
    只要是赚钱，在美国做什么生意的都有。塔斯社十月二十日电讯，引“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”的报道说，纽约市贩卖贫民窟破房屋的人近来十分活跃，他们在美国法律保护下，顷刻之间就可赚一大笔钱。在纽约黑人区布鲁克林贫民窟，一幢估价三千美元的房子，可以七千五百美元卖出，再转一个手就能卖到一万一千美元；另一幢房子价值四千二百美元，转两次手便能获利八千三百美元。
    这种生意，是不用多大成本的，有的房屋只要略加修理，甚至有的根本不修理，就可进行他们的投机活动，获得厚利。因此，在纽约市内，连“可尊敬的人士”也从事这种生涯了。
    犯罪案破纪录
    美国国内犯罪情况今年上半年达到空前恶劣的纪录。据美国联邦调查局最近公布的纪录表明：在今年一月一日到七月一日半年中，一共发生了一百零四万七千二百九十件重大犯罪案，比去年同时期增加了百分之二·五。而去年的犯罪数字已经是破纪录的数字了。联邦调查局所列举的今年上半年犯罪案分类如下：杀人案六千四百七十起，强奸案八千八百六十起，抢劫案二万九千六百一十起，蓄意谋杀的袭击案四万五千六百三十起，偷盗案八十四万四千一百二十起，偷汽车案十一万二千六百起。平均在美国每四点三分钟就有一个人被谋杀、强奸或受到蓄意杀害的袭击。这些当然还只是有案可查和官方公布的数字。
