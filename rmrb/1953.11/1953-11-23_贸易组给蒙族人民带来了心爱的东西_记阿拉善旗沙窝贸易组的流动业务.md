The Sh窝 area of Alxa League, Ningxia Province, is a region where Mongolian people live in concentrated communities. It is sparsely populated, vast in area, spanning thousands of miles, and transportation is extremely inconvenient, relying entirely on camels to transport goods. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the local specialties were worthless, and the Mongolian people lived a very hard life. Some could not afford tea, sugar, or wine all year round, and could not afford new clothes for several years. This was the suffering brought to the people by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

In order to change this backward and impoverished life of the Mongolian people in Sh窝, the Bayanhot Trade Branch of Ningxia Province selected many Mongolian cadres to cooperate with Han cadres to establish the Sh窝 Trade Team in July 1952. At the beginning of the establishment of the trade team, they were determined to learn business and trade policies from Han cadres. The Han cadres would learn the Mongolian language and customs from the Mongolian cadres. They would teach and learn from each other, and they would definitely do a good job in the trade work of Sh窝. After a year of practical training, they have all learned very well. Some Mongolian cadres have been promoted to leading cadres. For example, Mongolian cadre Ma Fucheng has been promoted to deputy leader of the Chahan'di Trade Team. Han cadres have learned the general business terms and can use them freely, and they can go out to the yurts without a translator. In carrying out their business, the trade team is united, hardworking, and enduring hardships. They themselves shake out the hair and pack the bags, dry the *cistanche deserticola* (a local medicinal material), cook, collect manure, chop firewood, and also graze livestock. They work hard to meet the living needs of the Mongolian people at all times.

In the past year, the Sh窝 Trade Team has carried out trade work in Bayan Bulidu, Bayan Nur Gong, Yabulai, Jilantai, Zongbieli and other regions. Among them, the Yabulai Trade Team sent mobile personnel to the *cistanche deserticola* producing areas of Yinde'erstu and Congrong Hutong, two or three miles away, to carry out procurement business in order to facilitate the masses in selling local products. The Jilantai Trade Team also sent people to carry goods to Tukmu, the northernmost border of Alxa League. In addition, the variety of goods has gradually been improved. When the Sh窝 Trade Team was first established, it only operated grain and a few kinds of cloth. Now it operates the Mongolian people's favorite leather boots, brick tea, raw tobacco, top hats, wine and other commodities. The goods operated by the Jilantai Trade Team have more than 170 varieties. They carried goods and traveled all over Sh窝. They have achieved great results in supplying the Mongolian people with daily necessities and purchasing local specialties from the Mongolian people. Taking the Yabulai Trade Team as an example, from July 1952 to August 1953, it supplied the Mongolian people with grain, various kinds of cloth, brick tea, sugar, wine, and other general merchandise worth a total of 295 million yuan; it purchased camel hair, wool, *cistanche deserticola*, and various kinds of hides produced by the Mongolian people with a total value of more than 700 million yuan. In addition, the temporary trade team, in cooperation with the Alxa ethnic work team, departed in May 1953 and returned in mid-August. It lasted more than three months, carrying grain, cloth, groceries, etc., penetrating into the northern and central parts of Alxa League, traveling more than 2,000 miles, meeting with more than 7,000 Mongolian people, and the total value of purchases and sales was also more than 170 million yuan. These purchased local livestock products and sold daily necessities were all transported in and out by the trade team under extremely difficult transportation conditions.

In the first half of this year, some areas of Alxa League suffered from natural disasters. In order to help the disaster victims overcome the disasters, the Sh窝 Trade Team cooperated with the government's production and disaster relief work, carried out the purchase of local products, and mobilized the masses to dig up local products. The Yabulai Trade Team mobilized more than 500 herdsmen to dig *cistanche deserticola* in Guishu Bag. The Jilantai Trade Team mobilized 25 herdsmen to dig *cistanche deserticola*, and mobilized 58 people to dig licorice in Zongbieli Bag. These herdsmen have achieved very good results in digging up local products. Taking Guishu Bag as an example, of the 523 people who participated in digging *cistanche deserticola*, 411 were Mongolian people. The total dried *cistanche deserticola* was about 130,000 jin, averaging about 250 jin per person, and the most could dig up to 800 jin.

The Sh窝 Trade Team's planned purchase of local products from the herdsmen satisfied the herdsmen's demands, so the herdsmen responded very well. For example, the poor herdsman Sanglamucao has a family of five and only six camels, and his life is very difficult. This year, he participated in digging *cistanche deserticola* and sold more than 2 million yuan. He bought what he loved from the trade team. He picked up a pair of new boots and jumped up happily and said: "My daughter is seventeen years old this year. I wanted to buy her a pair of new boots a long time ago, but I couldn't afford it because I didn't have the money. Today, I have fulfilled my wish."

The Sh窝 herdsmen love the trade team very much and often help solve the difficulties of the trade team's residence and supplies. For example, when the trade team purchased *cistanche deserticola* in Guishu in April this year, the grain supply could not keep up for a while, and the miners and the purchasing team were about to run out of food. The Lama Temple immediately lent the trade team 2,000 jin of flour, which solved the problem of rations. Also, every summer, after the camels leave the field, the only camel transportation tool in Sh窝 comes to a standstill, and the herdsmen take the initiative to help transport, ensuring the supply of materials. These fully demonstrate the trust of the Sh窝 herdsmen in the People's Government and the trade team.

    贸易组给蒙族人民带来了心爱的东西
    ——记阿拉善旗沙窝贸易组的流动业务
    方承杰
    宁夏省阿拉善旗沙窝，是蒙族人民聚居的地区。这里人口少，地域大，纵横数千里，交通极不便利，全靠骆驼运送货物。在国民党反动派统治时期，由于土特产不值钱，蒙民生活很苦，有的终年吃不上茶叶、糖、酒，几年不能穿上新衣，这是国民党反动派带给人民的苦难。
    宁夏巴音浩特贸易支公司为了改变沙窝蒙民这种落后贫困的生活，抽出很多蒙族干部配合汉族干部，在一九五二年七月成立了沙窝贸易组。在贸易组刚成立时，他们就抱定决心，提出蒙族干部向汉族干部学习业务，学习贸易政策；汉族干部向蒙族干部学习蒙族语言，蒙民风俗习惯，互教互学，一定把沙窝的贸易工作做好。经过一年来的实际锻炼，他们都学习得很好，现在蒙族干部已熟悉了业务，有些同志已被提拔为领导干部。如蒙族干部马福成已提拔为擦汗地贸易组副组长。汉族干部都学会了一般业务上的用语，并且可以运用自如，一个人不带翻译也能出去走蒙古包了。贸易组在开展业务中，都团结一致，吃苦耐劳，自己抖毛装包、翻晒大芸（当地出产的药材）、做饭、拾粪、打柴，还放牲口。他们时刻为满足蒙民的生活需要而努力工作。
    一年来，沙窝贸易组在巴音布立都、巴音诺尔公、雅布赖、吉兰泰、宗别立等地区开展了贸易工作，其中雅布赖贸易组为了便利群众出卖土产，派出流动人员到两、三里以外的大芸产地印得儿斯图、苁容胡同一带，开展收购业务。吉兰泰贸易组也派人携带货物，直到阿拉善旗最北边境图克木。另外在经营品种上，也逐步得到改进。沙窝贸易组刚成立时只经营粮食和很少几种布匹，现在已经营蒙民心爱的皮靴子、砖茶、生烟、礼帽、酒等商品。吉兰泰贸易组经营的货物，已有一百七十多种。他们携带货物，走遍了全沙窝，在供应蒙民生活必需品与收购蒙民土特产方面，已获得了很大的成绩。单就雅布赖贸易组来说，从一九五二年七月至一九五三年八月，供应了蒙民粮食、各种布匹、砖茶、糖、酒以及其他百货等总值二亿九千五百多万元的商品；收购了蒙民出产的驼毛、羊毛、大芸、各种皮张投放总值七亿多元。另外，配合阿拉善族工作队的临时贸易组，于一九五三年五月出发，八月中旬返回，历时三个多月，携带粮食、布匹、杂货等，深入阿拉善旗北部中部，走过二千多里的路程，与七千多蒙民见了面，购销总值也在一亿七千多万元。这些收购来的土牧产品与销出去的日用品，都是贸易组在交通运输极其困难的条件下，设法运出运进的。
    今年上半年，阿拉善旗部分地区发生灾荒，沙窝贸易组为了帮助灾民渡过灾荒，配合政府生产救灾工作，开展了土产收购业务，并发动群众挖掘土产。雅布赖贸易组发动牧民五百多人在贵树巴格挖大芸。吉兰泰贸易组发动牧民二十五人挖大芸，又发动五十八人在宗别立巴格挖甘草。这些牧民挖土产成绩很好，以贵树巴格为例，参加挖大芸的五百二十三人，内有蒙民四百一十一人，总计晒干了的大芸约为十三万斤，平均每人挖了二百五十斤左右，最多的能挖到八百斤。
    沙窝贸易组对牧民进行有计划的收购土产，满足了牧民的要求，因此牧民反映很好。如贫苦牧民桑拉木草，他家中有五口人，仅有骆驼六只，生活十分困难，他今年参加挖大芸，共卖了二百多万元，向贸易组购进了他心爱的东西，他拿着一双新靴子，快乐得跳起来说：“我女儿今年十七岁了，我很早就想给她买一双新靴子，因为没有钱，买不起，今天算我达到了我的心愿了。”
    沙窝牧民非常热爱贸易组，经常帮助解决贸易组住所、用物的困难。如今年四月贸易组在贵树收购大芸时，粮食一时供应不上，挖采工人和收购组都快要断炊。喇嘛庙立刻借给贸易组面粉两千斤，解决了口粮的困难。又如每到夏天骆驼下场后，沙窝唯一的骆驼运输工具停顿下来，牧民就主动帮助运输，保证了物资供应。这些充分表现了沙窝牧民对人民政府和贸易组的信任。
