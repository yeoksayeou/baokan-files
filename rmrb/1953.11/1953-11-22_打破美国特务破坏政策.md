Break the US Special Agent Sabotage Policy
Hesheng

On June 13 of this year, an Associated Press reporter reported that "the US government secretly obtained preliminary congressional approval for funding Asian 'anti-communist underground organizations'," and allocated a large supplementary appropriation for this purpose. Today we see that this kind of special agent sabotage policy of the United States has been strongly reflected in the POW camp in Dongchang-ri.

Returned POWs from our side have already revealed that special agent organizations of the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs are carrying out various terrorist rule and sabotage activities in the POW camps. The Indian spokesman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has also repeatedly pointed out that there are so-called "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" organizations in each camp in the POW camps, which are threatening POWs not to request repatriation, and these special agent organizations are directed by Seoul and Taipei. Recently, the Indian custodial forces also found a radio transmitter that the "United Nations Command" planned to smuggle to special agents in the POW camp. What is the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth Corps"? Isn't it the Asian "anti-communist underground organization" supported by the United States? And isn't the act of smuggling radio transmitters exposing the truth that the US military authorities are supporting special agent organizations in the POW camps? All of this shows that the special agent sabotage activities in the Dongchang-ri POW camp are also an important part of the special agent sabotage policy pursued by the United States worldwide.

For three years, our captured personnel have been living under the terrorist rule of US special agents. After they were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the US special agent control became even more strict and insane. A large number of special agents mixed into the Dongchang-ri POW camp. They used sharp blades, dungeons, chained rings, dissecting abdomens and digging out hearts, and dismembering corpses and burning bones... to threaten the POWs to give up their right to request repatriation. After the explanation work began, the US side first instructed special agent elements to impersonate "POW representatives" to prevent POWs from coming out to listen to the explanation. When POWs had already been taken out of the camp to listen to the explanation by the Indian custodial forces, the US side sent special agent elements to impersonate "detaining party representatives," "observation representatives," "reporters," or "interpreters" to threaten the POWs listening to the explanation. On the one hand, it instructed special agent elements impersonating POWs to make a lot of noise during the explanation, insulting and even injuring the explanation representatives and the staff of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and nailing themselves behind the POWs, tightly controlling the POWs, preventing them from daring to walk through the "repatriation gate," and only shouting "Return to Taiwan"... On November 16, when the explanation work was resumed, Wen Chonghao, the head of the Li Seung-man special agent organization "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," personally directed the special agents to carry out sabotage work, and threatened the POWs by saying, "You only have a future if you beat and insult the explanation representatives." Of course, under this kind of special agent sabotage, the explanation work cannot be carried out, and even if it is carried out, it cannot achieve the purpose stipulated in the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and cannot "guarantee that all POWs have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice."

Now the explanation work has been suspended for the fifth time. The US promotion of the special agent sabotage policy is the main reason why the explanation work has been repeatedly suspended. "The Times of India" reporter Reddy reported from South Korea that it is already an open secret that these special agent elements impersonating POWs will never let the POWs come out to listen to the explanation, "unless they have secretly received orders from the United Nations Command or the leaders of the psychological warfare organization (that is, the special agent organization) that has subjected them to ideological training in the past three years." From this we can also see that if we do not break the special agent control in the POW camps, the explanation work cannot achieve the desired effect. And the facts have proved that this kind of special agent control can be broken: because the Indian custodial forces have initially taken some necessary measures against the special agent elements, more than 30 Chinese POWs in the 28th camp have requested repatriation. It was only because the Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission violated the resolution on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission being able to use force and prohibited the use of force "under any circumstances" that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces were helpless in dealing with the special agent control in the POW camps. In this way, under the protection of the prohibition of the use of force, US special agent elements more frantically prevented POWs from listening to the explanation, causing the explanation work to be interrupted again and again, and the implementation of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" was seriously damaged.

Recently, on the one hand, the US side has been clamoring that our side's "explanation time for POWs is too long" and "inhumane"; on the other hand, it has been clamoring to release the POWs "when the time comes." US Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated at a press conference in Washington on November 17 that the United States insists that "all un-repatriated POWs must be released on January 22 next year," and openly said that the POWs from Korea and China should be sent to the Li and Chiang bandit gangs so that these POWs could "re-enlist" and serve as the US's aggressive cannon fodder. Byun Yung-tai, the foreign minister of the Li Seung-man puppet government, also made the same clamor on the same day, and threatened the Indian custodial forces to withdraw from the demilitarized zone when the "time comes" on January 22 next year. And the Associated Press even claimed that if they are not released "when the time comes," the POWs will "run away on a large scale." Dulles and Byun Yung-tai, these two warmongers, sang in harmony, and the Associated Press beat the drums from the side, indicating that the US's special agent sabotage activities in the POW camps have undergone new developments. The US's plan is to promote the special agent sabotage policy by all despicable means in order to delay until "the time comes" and achieve their goal of forcibly detaining POWs.

Therefore, whether the explanation work can be carried out in the future and whether it can achieve the desired effect, there is no other effective way except to break the special agents' control over the POW camps.

    打破美国特务破坏政策
    禾生
    今年六月十三日，美国合众社记者报道说：“美国政府秘密地取得了国会对拨款支持亚洲‘反共地下组织’的初步同意”，并且为了这个目的，拨出一大笔补充款项来。今天我们看到：美国的这种特务破坏政策，已在东场里战俘营里强烈地反映出来了。
    被遣返归来的我方被俘人员早已揭露：李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的特务组织在战俘营里进行着各种恐怖统治和破坏活动；中立国遣返委员会印度发言人也一再指出：在战俘营里的每个营场中都有所谓“反共青年团”的组织，它们正在威胁战俘不得要求遣返，这些特务组织是受汉城和台北指挥的。最近，印度看管部队又查出了“联合国军司令部”打算偷运给战俘营特务的无线电机。所谓“反共青年团”是什么呢？不正是美国所支持的亚洲“反共地下组织”吗？而偷运无线电机的勾当，不是正暴露了美军当局支持战俘营里的特务组织的真相吗？所有这一切，都说明了东场里战俘营里的特务破坏活动，也正是美国在全世界范围内推行的特务破坏政策的一个重要部分。
    三年来我方被俘人员一直生活在美方特务的恐怖统治之下，而当他们被交给中立国遣返委员会看管后，美方的特务控制就更加严密和疯狂了，大批特务混到东场里战俘营里来，他们用利刃、土牢、连环保，剖腹挖心、碎尸焚骨……来威胁战俘放弃要求遣返的权利。在解释工作开始后，美方首先指使特务分子冒充“战俘代表”，阻挠战俘出来听取解释。在战俘已被印度看管部队带出营场听取解释时，美方又一面派遣特务分子冒充“拘留一方代表”、“观察代表”、“记者”或“译员”，对听取解释的战俘进行威胁；一面又指使冒充战俘的特务分子，在听取解释时大吵大闹，辱骂甚至伤害解释代表和中立国遣返委员会的工作人员，钉在战俘后面死死地控制着战俘，使他们不敢走“遣返门”，只能喊“回台湾”……。十一月十六日解释工作恢复时，李承晚特务组织“反共青年团”头子文重浩，更亲自指挥特务进行破坏工作，并威胁战俘说：“你们只有殴打和侮辱解释代表才有前途。”当然，在这种特务破坏的情况下，解释工作是无法进行的，就是进行，也无法达到“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中所规定的目的，无法“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。
    现在解释工作已是第五次停顿了。美国推行特务破坏政策，就是使解释工作一再陷于停顿的主要原因。“印度时报”记者雷迪自南朝鲜报道说：这已经是一个公开的秘密，这些冒充战俘的特务分子绝不会让战俘出来听取解释，“除非他们已经私下接到联合国军司令部或者过去三年中对他们施以思想训练的心理战组织（就是特务组织）的领袖们的命令。”从这里我们也可以看出，如果不打破战俘营里的特务控制，解释工作就不可能收到应有的效果。而事实证明这种特务控制是可以打破的：由于印度看管部队对特务分子初步采取了一下必要的措施，第二十八号营场中就有三十多名中国战俘要求遣返。只是由于中立国遣返委员会瑞士委员违反了关于中立国遣返委员会能够使用武力的决议，禁止在“任何情况下”使用武力，才使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在对付战俘营里的特务控制时束手无策。这样，在禁止使用武力的庇护下，美方特务分子就更加猖狂地阻挠战俘去听取解释，以致使解释工作一次又一次地中断，使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的实施遭到严重的破坏。
    最近美方一方面叫嚷着我方对战俘的“解释时间太长”，“不人道”；一方面又叫嚣到“期”释放战俘。美国国务卿十一月十七日在华盛顿记者招待会上公开地说：美国坚持“所有未遣返的战俘，必须在明年一月二十二日予以释放”，并且公然说：要把朝中被俘人员送给李、蒋匪帮，使这些战俘“重新入伍”，充当美国的侵略炮灰。李承晚伪政府外务部长官卞荣泰也在同一天作了同样的叫嚣，并且威胁印度看管部队要在明年一月二十二日到“期”时撤出非军事区。而合众社更扬言，如果到“期”不释放，战俘就会“大规模逃跑”。杜勒斯和卞荣泰这两个好战分子的一唱一和，外加合众社的敲边鼓，说明美方在战俘营里的特务破坏活动又有了新的发展。美方的打算是：用一切卑劣的手段推行特务破坏政策，以便拖延到“期”，达到他们强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    因此，今后解释工作能不能进行，能不能收到效果，除过打破特务对战俘营的控制而外，没有任何别的有效办法。
