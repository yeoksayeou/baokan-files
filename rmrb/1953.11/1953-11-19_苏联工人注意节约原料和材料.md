Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th: Soviet workers are constantly paying attention to conserving raw materials and materials.

The Kagarnak Sugar Refinery in Ukraine is very careful to reduce the loss of sugar beet, the raw material for sugar production, during transportation and storage. In September and October, the factory produced an additional 22 metric tons of sugar due to savings in this area. The factory also pays attention to the full utilization of raw materials in the sugar production process. In this way, in September and October alone, the factory produced nearly 400 metric tons more of product. In the past two months, the factory has saved a total of 695,000 rubles by continuously reducing the consumption of raw materials, auxiliary materials, and fuel. The Tanilov Sugar Refinery in Ukraine also saved 1,195,000 rubles in the same period by reducing losses of raw materials and materials.

Soviet workers are working hard to find new technical operating methods to reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials. Advanced workers at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, by improving the device on the grinder, reduced the consumption of bearing alloy when grinding bearing bushes. Now, they can save 725 cubic centimeters of bearing alloy when grinding a set of bearing bushes, reduce bearing alloy by 200 cubic centimeters when grinding a set of eccentric shaft bearing steel rings, and reduce bearing alloy by 1,029 cubic centimeters when manufacturing a set of tractor bearings. A comprehensive team at the factory has saved 2.1 million rubles by implementing a number of technical innovations.

Reducing the consumption of raw materials and materials is an important source of cost savings. The workers in the second open-hearth furnace workshop of the Andreyev Steel Plant in Taganrog, by implementing rapid steelmaking methods and conserving smelting materials, now produce each ton of steel for 30 rubles cheaper than last year. Due to the reduction in costs, they have saved 2 million rubles this year.

    苏联工人注意节约原料和材料
    【新华社莫斯科十八日电】苏联工人经常注意节约原料、材料。
    乌克兰的卡加尔纳克制糖联合工厂很注意在运输和贮藏中减少制糖原料甜菜的损失。在九、十两个月内，该厂由于在这方面的节约多生产了二十二公担糖。该厂在制糖过程中也注意充分利用原料。这样，仅在九、十两月内，该厂就多生产了将近四百公担的产品。两月来，该厂由于不断减少原料、辅助材料和燃料消耗，总共节约了六十九万五千卢布。乌克兰的塔尼洛夫制糖联合工厂在同一时期内，也由于减少原料、材料的损失，节约了一百一十九万五千卢布。
    苏联工人都为减少原料和材料的消耗，努力寻找新的技术操作方法。车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂的先进工人们，由于改进了磨床上的装置，在磨制轴瓦时减少了轴承合金的消耗。现在，他们在磨制一副轴瓦时，可以比过去节约七百二十五公分轴承合金；在磨制一副偏心轮轴轴承钢环时，可以减少轴承合金二百公分；在制造一副拖拉机轴承时，可以减少轴承合金一千零二十九公分。该厂的一个综合小组由于实行了许多技术上的革新，已节约了二百一十万卢布。
    减低原料和材料的耗费是节约成本的重要来源。塔干洛格的安德烈耶夫钢铁厂第二平炉车间的工人们，由于实行快速炼钢法并节约冶炼材料，现在他们冶炼的每吨钢比去年便宜三十个卢布。由于成本降低，他们今年已节约了二百万卢布。
