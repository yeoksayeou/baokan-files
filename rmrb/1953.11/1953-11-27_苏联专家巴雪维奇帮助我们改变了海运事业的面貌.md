　　Our maritime transport industry has developed greatly in recent years. Since liberation, the operational efficiency of coastal vessels has increased more than twofold compared to the period of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. Significant achievements have also been made in accelerating operations, improving loading and unloading efficiency, and reducing cargo handling costs. These achievements are inseparable from the valuable assistance provided by Soviet experts such as Comrade V.V. Bashevich.

　　After the liberation of most areas of the country in 1949, we were unfamiliar with maritime transport work. The dilapidated institutions we inherited were overlapping and branching, with high and inconsistent freight and port rates, as well as complex procedures. At that time, many cadres lacked sufficient understanding of maritime transport, and their management ideas were unclear. There was a relatively serious “port managing navigation” mentality. After Soviet expert Bashevich came to China and learned about these situations, he told us, "Maritime transport has great significance for the development of the national economy and culture, and for consolidating national strength and defense capabilities," and that "maritime transport is an important link in the transportation network, and it has special importance in foreign trade." He also said, "The port authority is not only a management agency, but also an economic accounting unit. If the 'port managing navigation' mentality exists, it will 'manage' the turnover rate of ships." With his help, the Northeast Shipping Administration Bureau was changed to the Shipping Affairs Bureau, shifting from purely administrative management to active operation of the transport business, in order to fully develop shipping and serve the national economy. In March 1951, the Ministry of Communications held the Second National Shipping Conference. Comrade Bashevich delivered a speech on maritime transport work at the meeting. At his active suggestion, the Ministry of Communications decided to establish separate and unified shipping agencies. In July 1951, the three general bureaus of maritime transport, river transport, and channel engineering were formally separated. The 34 coastal port and shipping institutions across the country were also merged successively, thereby unifying the maritime transport work in the North and South Seas, and providing a unified leading agency for the national maritime transport work.

　　While unifying institutions, Comrade Bashevich paid close attention to improving the operation and management of maritime transport to increase freight rates. He told our maritime transport cadres very early on: "Port work must focus on loading and unloading goods to serve transportation. Port work must ensure the full use of maritime shipping capacity, accelerate transportation, and reduce the cost of cargo storage, loading, and unloading in ports." To this end, he personally went to Andong, Yingkou, and other places to conduct investigations and research on port operations. Based on China's specific conditions, he helped us draft regulations such as the "Sea Port Regulations," "Port Authority Charter," and "Mutual Responsibility of Ports and Shipping," and made special reports on loading and unloading quotas, loading and unloading operation plans, loading and unloading standards for ships in ports, and methods for calculating berthing time. Due to the establishment and gradual implementation of these systems, port charges and business procedures were simplified, facilitating cargo owners and ensuring the development of cargo sources. For example, the number of charges was simplified from a maximum of 132 to six; the number of procedures in Dalian Port was reduced from more than ten to two to four; and the number of procedures in Tianjin Port was also reduced from four to one to two. In order to solve the fundamental problem of maritime transport cargo sources, he and our comrades from the port authorities of Andong and Yingkou in the Northeast also held many cargo owner meetings. He said, "This is like looking in a mirror once a month to improve our maritime transport work." The cargo owner meetings were used to understand the cargo sources and also to conduct investigations and research for monthly cargo transportation plans, making the cargo transportation plans more practical. Now, this kind of cargo owner meeting has almost become a major system of every port authority and is being implemented. In May of last year, when he heard that the loading rate in Guangzhou Port was not high, he personally went to Guangzhou to help improve port operations, reducing the time for ship operations and loading and unloading by half. Under the promotion of Comrade Bashevich, the national daily maritime loading and unloading efficiency has more than doubled in the past two years, with a loading and unloading worker able to load 14 tons of grain in eight hours. In September and October of this year, the national maritime loading and unloading rate generally increased by 50% compared to the quota.

　　Starting from the basic viewpoints of reducing costs and improving passenger and freight transport, Comrade Bashevich also emphasized the consistency of work in ports, ships, and shipyards. He said, "Ports, ships, and factories must all obey a common goal: that is, to strictly implement ship operation charts, link ship operation charts with port work shift operation plans, and combine them with shipyard production plans to form a balanced and rhythmic production of the entire maritime transport." To this end, in May of this year, he personally went to Shanghai to check and solve the problem of consistent cooperation between ports, ships, and factories. This resulted in a shipping volume of 420,000 tons in September and October of this year.

　　The planning and dispatch work of the Maritime Transport General Bureau was also established with the help of Comrade Bashevich. He emphasized the need to strengthen the dispatching agency so that it could skillfully become the headquarters for dispatching and commanding the operation of maritime vessels, in order to fully exert the efficiency of ship transportation, avoid non-productive berthing of ships in ports, and prevent maritime accidents. During the Spring Festival of 1951, the Dalian-Yantai route was very crowded with passengers. In order to take care of the passengers' needs, a cargo ship was temporarily dispatched to transport passengers. When Comrade Bashevich learned about this, he criticized us, saying, "This is a risky action. The dispatching staff should fully consider navigation safety and solve problems such as life-saving equipment before the cargo ship can carry passengers." In Andong, he went to a ship and found that gasoline was loaded below and corn was loaded above in the same cabin. He immediately pointed it out and corrected it. These things greatly educated our crew members and maritime transport cadres. Comrades from the dispatching department of the Maritime Transport General Bureau said, "Our understanding of the dispatching work as the headquarters for commanding ship operations was not sufficient. In the past, we often attributed the failure to complete the plan to objective difficulties, such as the impact of typhoons and weather, and changes in cargo, but our foresight on these situations was not enough. Comrade Bashevich's education for us was really too great." In dispatching work, Comrade Bashevich also helped us establish dispatching and seaport supervision systems, large regulations such as dispatching regulations, seaport supervision regulations, and crew member examination regulations; various systems such as dispatching communication rules, monthly dispatching meetings, and various reporting systems; and small things such as ship dynamic small cards were also drafted by the expert himself. These increased the ears and eyes of the maritime transport leading agency, enabling the Maritime Transport General Bureau to command and supervise the dynamic of ships at every moment. In this way, the national maritime transport work became a more unified management unit, and maritime transport work embarked on a planned path, connecting it with the national transportation system as a unified whole.

　　In order to truly and universally give full play to ship operating rates, accelerate ship turnover, improve loading and unloading efficiency, and reduce freight rates and port charges, with the active help of Comrade Bashevich, the Maritime Transport General Bureau selected two ships in the second quarter of last year to start cultivating advanced voyages. In addition to giving us reports, Comrade Bashevich personally went to Qinhuangdao to guide the crew members on board in learning advanced Soviet production charts—hourly operation schedule charts, steering record charts, and boiler pressure rise and fall record charts. He taught very seriously and patiently until everyone understood before he would finish. Before the ship set sail, he personally went on board to check the ship's maintenance and carefully taught the on-board staff how to use the compass. After the two ships departed, they sent a challenge telegram to maritime transport vessels across the country, setting off an advanced voyage movement. Under his specific guidance, the advanced voyage work of the two ships progressed relatively smoothly, but he was still not at ease. Later, he personally went to Qinhuangdao to check the advanced voyages and the implementation of various advanced charts. When he saw that the hourly operation chart was drawn too large during the inspection, he said, "Now the crew members are more skilled in operation, and the chart can be drawn on the blackboard, which is both simple and economical." It can be seen that his concern for cultivating advanced voyage work is meticulous. The advanced voyage work has powerfully made all maritime transport staff realize that there is endless potential in ports and shipping, and the advanced voyage work clearly points out the direction of tapping potential.

　　In recent years, with the help of Comrade Bashevich, the operation and management have been further improved, and the business of various departments has been improved. The efficiency of ship operation and the efficiency of loading and unloading in ports have been greatly improved, thus continuously reducing freight rates and reducing cargo circulation costs. The average freight rate for domestic transportation of goods has been reduced by 75%, and the average freight rate for foreign imported goods has been reduced by 67%. For example, for coal, salt, grain, soybean cake, hardware, timber, and cloth, the average port charges used to be more than 100,000 yuan, but now the various port charges per ton are generally only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. In recent years, the freight rate for coal transportation from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai has been reduced four times, a total reduction of 42.82%.

　　Comrade Bashevich is equally concerned about the improvement of port terminals, especially the reconstruction of small ports. He often said, "The port is an important link in maritime shipping work - loading and unloading." Therefore, he is not only concerned about the improvement of work in major ports, but also about the improvement of work in small and medium-sized ports. Last winter, he braved the wind and snow and arrived in Yantai in the severe cold of minus 16 degrees Celsius to find the director of the Yantai Port Branch Bureau to understand the natural changes of the Yantai port terminal. However, at that time, we were not consciously paying attention to collecting materials in this regard. Therefore, the expert found a dozen dockworkers and porters over the age of 50 to hold a symposium, where he collected a lot of information about the natural conditions of the port. Finally, he said, "Yantai has a lot of information, a lot of living information." The snow did not stop for four or five days while living in Yantai, but the work of our Soviet friend, Comrade Bashevich, did not stop. It was in these severe cold days that he helped to make a plan to rebuild Yantai Port at a low cost. Later, he went to the Weihaiwei Port Office to inquire about the water level of the port and personally took tools to measure it in the water. On the way, when the car he was riding in encountered piles of snow, he got out of the car to sweep the snow. Sometimes, he crossed in an icy river, and when the car collapsed in the river, he got out of the car to pull the car across the river together. His working style of going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, and his spirit of hard work and endurance set a very good example for us. The comrades who set off with Comrade Bashevich last winter are still very moved and said, "This inspection of the small ports was very rewarding, and it pointed out a new direction for us to improve the work of the small ports. The expert's every move along the way is a learning example for us."

　　Comrade Bashevich paid great attention to the training of our technical and management cadres. When he was in the Northeast, he personally presided over the opening of two transportation business training classes. He almost gave all the lectures in the first phase. He had left when the second phase opened, but he also used his lecture notes for the classes. These two training classes trained more than 150 students, and most of these students have become the backbone of maritime transport work after being assigned. At the beginning of this year, he repeatedly proposed to summarize the actual experience in Chinese technology and use the Chinese experience—that is, the experience of combining Soviet experience with Chinese conditions—as teaching materials to run training classes and systematically train Chinese maritime transport cadres. However, Comrade Bashevich was soon transferred back to China and did not have time to summarize the experience. But before leaving, he personally wrote a summary outline for us. Now the Maritime Transport General Bureau is preparing teaching materials according to Comrade Bashevich's outline, making active preparations for systematically training our maritime transport cadres.

    苏联专家巴雪维奇帮助我们改变了海运事业的面貌
    中央交通部计划司司长　孙大光
    我国的海运事业近年来有了很大的发展。解放以来，沿海船只的运用效率较之国民党反动统治时期，已提高了两倍多。其他像加速运转，提高装卸效率，降低货物装卸费用等都有了显著成绩。这些成绩的获得，是和苏联专家瓦·维·巴雪维奇等同志给予我们宝贵的帮助分不开的。
    一九四九年全国大部地区解放后，我们对海运工作是不熟悉的，接收下来的破烂机构又是重叠分枝的，运价和港费率都很高，又不统一，而且手续很繁杂。当时，很多干部对海运工作认识不足，经营思想不明确，存在着较严重的港管航的思想。苏联专家巴雪维奇来到中国了解到这些情况后，就告诉我们说：“海运对国家经济文化的发展，对巩固国家威力和国防能力都具有巨大的意义”，“海上运输是交通网的重要环节，在对外贸易方面更具有特殊的重要意义。”并说：“港务局不仅是一个管理机构，而且也是一个经济核算单位，假使存在着港管航的思想，那么就会把船舶的运转率‘管’住了。”在他的帮助下，当时的东北航政总局才改为航务总局，从单纯的行政管理转向于积极对运输事业的经营，以全力发展船舶运输，为国民经济服务。一九五一年三月，中央交通部召开了第二届航务会议，巴雪维奇同志在会上作了关于海运工作的讲演，在他积极建议下，中央交通部决定分别建立统一的航务机构，一九五一年七月正式分设了海运、河运、航道工程三个总局，全国沿海港航三十四处机构，也先后分别进行合并，从而统一了南北洋的海上运输工作，使全国的海运工作有了统一的领导机构。
    在统一机构的同时，巴雪维奇同志更十分注意改善海运业务的经营管理，以提高货运率。很早他就告诉我们的海运干部说：“港务工作一定要以装卸货物为主，作到为运输服务。港务工作一定要保证充分使用海上船舶运输能力，加速运输与减少货物在港保管装卸费用。”为此，他曾亲自到安东、营口各地作了港务工作的调查研究工作，根据我国的具体情况，他帮我们起草了“海港条例”“港务局章程”“港航相互关系责任”等规章草案，并作了有关装卸定额，装卸作业计划，船舶在港装卸标准及停泊时间计算办法等专题报告。由于建立并逐步贯彻了这些制度，因而简化了港口费目和业务手续，便利货主，保证货源的开辟。如费目就由最多的一百三十二种简化为六种；大连港由原十余道手续减为二道至四道；天津港也由四道减为一道至两道。为了解决海运货源的根本问题，他在东北还和我们安东、营口的港务局同志一道召开了很多货主会，他说：“这样每月可以照一次镜子，改进我们的海运工作。”通过货主会对货源进行摸底，同时也为订月的运货计划作了调查研究，使货运计划更切合实际。现在这种货主会差不多已成为每个港务局的主要制度而贯彻执行了。去年五月份，他听说广州港装货率不高，他就亲自到广州去帮助改进港务工作，使船舶运转和装卸时间缩短了一半。在巴雪维奇同志的推动下，二年来使全国每昼夜海运装卸效率提高了一倍以上，一个装卸工人八小时能装粮食十四吨。今年九、十月份全国海运的装卸率又普遍比定额提高了百分之五十。
    从降低成本，改善客货运的基本观点出发，巴雪维奇同志又十分强调港口、船舶、修船厂工作的一致性。他说：“港、船、厂都必须服从一个共同的目标：即严格执行船舶运行图表，使船舶运行图表和港口工作班作业计划连结起来，并与修船厂生产计划相结合，以组成海上运输整体的均衡而有节奏的生产。”为此，今年五月份他又亲自到上海去检查和解决港、船、厂一致配合的问题。使今年九、十月份船舶运输量达到四十二万吨。
    海运总局的计划调度工作，也是在巴雪维奇同志一手帮助下建立起来的。他强调必须加强调度机构，使它能巧妙地成为调度和指挥海上船舶运行的司令部，以充分发挥船舶运输效率，避免在港船只的非生产停泊，并防止海运事故的发生。一九五一年春节，大连到烟台航线旅客十分拥挤，为了照顾旅客的要求，临时调了一只货船去运客，巴雪维奇同志知道后，就批评我们说：“这是一种冒险行动，调度工作人员应该充分考虑到航行安全，要解决救生设备等问题后，货轮才能乘客。”在安东时，他到一艘船上去，发现在同一个舱内，下面装汽油，上面装玉米，当场就指出予以纠正。这些事情对我们的船员和海运干部教育很大。海运总局调度员同志们说：“我们对调度工作是指挥船舶运行的司令部的认识是不够的，过去完不成计划常推客观情况困难，如台风气象影响，货载变更等，但对这些情况的预见性是不够的，巴雪维奇同志对我们的教育实在太大了。”在调度工作上，巴雪维奇同志也同样帮我们建立了调度系统和海港监督系统，大的各种规章，如调度规章，海港监督章程，船员检定考试章程；各种制度如调度通讯规则，月度调度会议和各项报表制度；小的如船舶的动态小卡片也是专家亲手拟定的。这些，增加了海运领导机关的耳、目，使海运总局对船舶的每分每刻动态，都能指挥和监督。这样，才使全国海运工作变成了一个较统一的管理单位，使海运工作走上了计划性的道路，它和全国各运输系统连结成了一个统一的整体。
    为了能真正普遍高度地发挥船舶营运率，加速船舶周转，提高装卸效率，降低运价和港口费率，在巴雪维奇同志积极帮助下，海运总局去年第二季度就选定两艘轮船，开始培养先进航次的工作。巴雪维奇同志除了给我们作报告外，并亲赴秦皇岛，到船上指导船员学习苏联先进的生产图表——分时运行计划表，操舵纪录图表和锅炉气压升降纪录表，他很认真和耐心地教，直到大家懂得了才肯结束。在船舶开航前，他又亲自上船检查船舶保养情况，细心的拿罗盘具体教给船上工作人员看。两只轮船出发后，即向全国海运船只发出挑战通电，掀起了一个先进航次运动。在他具体指导下，两只船的先进航次工作进行得较顺利，可是他还不放心，后来又亲自到秦皇岛去检查先进航次及执行各种先进图表的工作。在检查时看到分时运行图表画得太大，他就说：“现在船员们操作较熟练些了，图表可画在黑板上，又简便又节省。”可见他对培养先进航次工作的关心是无微不至的。先进航次工作有力地使全体海运工作人员认识到港航存在着无穷的潜力，而先进航次的工作是明确地指出了挖潜力的方向。
    几年来，在巴雪维奇同志帮助下，进一步改善了经营管理，提高了各部门的业务，船舶运行效率和港湾装卸效率都有很大提高，因而不断降低了运价，减少了货物流转费用。国内运输货物费率平均降低百分之七十五，国外输入货物平均降低百分之六十七，如煤、盐、粮、豆饼、五金、木材、纱布等，过去收港口费平均在十万元以上，现在每吨所收港口各种费用一般只有二、三万元。几年来秦沪煤运运价降低四次，计降低百分之四十二点八二。
    巴雪维奇同志同样十分关心港口码头的改进工作，特别是小港的改建。他常说：“港口是海上船舶运输工作的重要一环——装货与卸货。”因而他不仅关心各大港工作的改进，亦关心着中小港工作的改进。去年冬季，他冒着风雪，在零下十六度的严寒中到了烟台，找烟台港务分局局长了解有关烟台港口码头的自然变化资料。可是，当时我们还没有意识地注意收集这方面的材料，因此，专家就找了十几个五十岁以上的码头工人和搬运工人召开座谈会，在会上收集了很多港口的自然情况。最后，他说：“烟台有很多资料，有许多活的资料。”住在烟台四、五天雪没有停过，可是，我们的苏联友人巴雪维奇同志的工作也没有歇过，就在这些严寒的日子里，他协助作出了花钱不多的改建烟台港的方案。后来，他又到威海卫港务办事处，询问港的水位，并亲自拿了工具到水里去量。在一路上，他坐的汽车有时碰到堆积着的雪堆，他也下车去扫雪，有时在冰河中开过，汽车塌在河里，他就一道下车拉汽车过河，他这种深入实际，调查研究的工作作风和刻苦耐劳的工作精神，为我们树立了很好的榜样。去年冬季和巴雪维奇同志一道出发的同志直到现在还很感动地说：“这次去视察各小港收获很大，为我们改进各小港工作又指出了一个新方向，在一路上专家的一举一动都是我们的学习榜样。”
    巴雪维奇同志对培养我们技术和管理干部的工作是十分注意的。他在东北时曾亲自主持开办了两次运输业务训练班，第一期的全部课程差不多全是他担任讲解，第二期开办时他出发了，但也都用他的讲义上的课。这两期训练班共训练了一百五十多个学员，这些学员分派出去后，绝大部分都成为海运工作中的骨干。今年年初他一再提出要把中国技术上的实际经验总结一下，用中国的经验——即苏联经验与中国情况结合的经验作教材，来开办训练班，有系统地培养中国的海运干部。可是不久巴雪维奇同志奉调回国，未来得及总结经验，但在临走前，他却亲自为我们写了一份总结提纲，现在海运总局正按照巴雪维奇同志的提纲在编写教材，为系统地训练我们海运干部作积极准备。
