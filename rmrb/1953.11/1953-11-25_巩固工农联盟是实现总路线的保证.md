Consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our country and the guarantee for the victory of our people's revolution and national construction. Before the victory of the people's democratic revolution, our worker-peasant alliance was an alliance led by the working class, represented by the Communist Party, to fight against the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China. Relying on such an alliance, we were able to persevere in the long-term revolutionary struggle and finally achieve the victory of the people's democratic revolution in a country with hundreds of millions of people. After this revolutionary victory, that is, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, our worker-peasant alliance is an alliance led by the working class, represented by the Communist Party, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and struggle for the transition to socialism.

In the past few years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, which are also the first few years of the transition period, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has played a huge role. Great victories have been achieved in the great struggles such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries and resisting US aggression and aiding Korea; both industrial and agricultural production have recovered and exceeded the highest levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan; since 1953, our country has begun to implement the first Five-Year Plan and has entered a period of large-scale economic construction. After several years of development in the actual life of the people, our country's general line for the transition to socialism has become clearer. At this time, further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance becomes even more important. There is only one path before the working class, and that is socialism. The peasant economy, however, stands at a crossroads: some peasants believe that only by continuing to follow the Communist Party on the socialist road can they become richer, and they have already done so, which is the road of mutual aid and cooperation to make everyone prosperous; but some peasants are thinking about or are already taking another road: that is, the capitalist road of trying to get rich by exploiting others. Peasants, especially middle peasants, are such a vacillating class: they are laborers, so they have the desire to take the socialist road; they are also private owners, so they also have the desire to take the capitalist road. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly overcome the capitalist tendencies of peasants as private owners and constantly consolidate the alliance between peasants as laborers and the working class.

How can the worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated?

To consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is first necessary to strengthen socialist industry and the entire socialist economy. Only in this way can agriculture be transformed more quickly into large-scale agriculture with collective production, using advanced technology, constantly increasing harvests, and constantly improving the lives of peasants. To this end, workers should strive to increase productivity, improve product quality, and reduce costs, on the one hand, to supply peasants with high-quality and inexpensive means of production and means of subsistence now, and on the other hand, to accumulate funds for the country and prepare for supplying peasants with new-style farm implements, up to agricultural machinery and electricity, in the future. Peasants should also actively increase production and sell their products to the state to support industrial construction.

To consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to mobilize peasants to voluntarily organize mutual aid teams and cooperatives for production. This is not only because organization can increase the harvest of agricultural products, provide more support for industrial construction, and improve the lives of peasants more; but also because only agricultural collectivization can prevent the development of capitalism in agriculture and consolidate it with socialist industry and commerce. To this end, the government and the working class should provide ideological guidance and material assistance to the organized peasants, and the peasants should also strive to move forward along the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

To consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to fight against capitalist elements in the countryside and the spontaneous capitalist tendencies among peasants. "The worker-peasant alliance can only be a solid alliance when it is based on the struggle against those capitalist elements secreted from the peasantry itself." (Stalin: On the Right Deviation in the CPSU (B)) If we do not carry out this struggle, we will be condoning speculators to infringe on the interests of the basic masses of laboring peasants, and the result will inevitably be to undermine the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop supply and marketing cooperatives, combine the peasant economy with the state economy, and gradually eliminate the activities of private commerce in the process of buying and selling grain and other important agricultural products, and prevent a small number of peasants from becoming merchants who exploit the laboring people; it is necessary to use state bank loans and the organization of credit cooperatives to fight against usurers in the countryside, and prevent a small number of peasants from becoming usurers. If supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives are well run, they can help improve agricultural production, limit the internal differentiation of peasants, and make the majority of peasants more convinced of the benefits of organization and more actively carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

To consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of Party organizations in the countryside. Rural Party members must always remember that rural Party organizations are the fortresses of the working class vanguard in the countryside; although some rural Party members still live the lives of peasants and inevitably still have many peasant ideas, they must constantly transform this thinking and remember that they are already glorious fighters of the working class vanguard and bear the important task of realizing the general line and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The worker-peasant alliance we advocate is not just any worker-peasant alliance, but a worker-peasant alliance that struggles under the leadership of the working class to realize the general line and build socialism. Strengthening the leadership of the working class over the worker-peasant alliance through the vanguard of the working class is of utmost importance for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

In order to take care of the interests of the peasants, can we reduce or slow down the development of industry and let the peasants have more years of "recuperation and rejuvenation" before engaging in large-scale industrial construction? This idea is completely wrong. We must first focus on developing industry, especially heavy industry, and we must maintain the current rate of industrial development, because only in this way can we ensure that our country becomes prosperous and strong and that the people become happy. Failure to do so will harm the entire country and the peasants as well.

Then, will carrying out large-scale industrial construction now make it "unaffordable" for the peasants? This idea is also completely wrong. The socialist economic laws and the decades of practice in the Soviet Union have told us that the development of socialism is the continuous improvement of production efficiency and the continuous growth of the material welfare of the laboring people, which eliminates any possibility of the state infringing on the interests of the peasants. The state will not overburden the peasants, because that is not only bad for the peasants, but also bad for the country, for socialist industry, and for the working class. If we do that, we will be destroying the foundation of the country's industrialization. In fact, our country has not adopted a policy of increasing agricultural taxes, lowering agricultural product prices, and raising industrial product prices; on the contrary, it has adopted a policy of stabilizing agricultural taxes, maintaining reasonable prices for agricultural products, and gradually lowering industrial product prices. The funds for industrialization mainly rely on the accumulation of state-owned enterprises themselves. In our country's fiscal revenue, the taxes and profits paid by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives accounted for 34.08 percent in 1950 and had reached 56.33 percent in 1952, accounting for 59.79 percent in this year's budget; the agricultural tax paid by peasants accounted for 29.63 percent in 1950, 17.08 percent in 1952, and only 14.56 percent in this year's budget. Of course, in addition to paying public grain, the peasants also sold a large amount of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products to the state, and the peasants have made contributions to the state; but the prices at which the state purchases agricultural products are completely fair and will never let the peasants suffer.

Is it possible to improve the lives of peasants by lowering the living standards of urban working people and reducing workers' wages? This idea is also completely wrong. The income of urban working people is the reward for their hard work, and it is not obtained from the peasants. In fact, they themselves do not receive a significant portion of the value created by their labor; this portion becomes the profits of enterprises and the state's fiscal revenue, which is used to expand reproduction. Assuming that workers' wages are actually reduced, it would only hinder the development of industrial construction and would be of no help to the lives of peasants, who are many times more numerous than workers. Moreover, the lives of most workers are not well-off, and their living expenses are much higher than those of peasants. The improvement of peasants' lives can only rely on the development of agricultural production, especially the development of large-scale agricultural production, which in turn requires the development of industry; only in this way, only by transforming the scattered small-scale peasant economy into a socialist cooperative and mechanized agricultural economy, can the income of peasants be greatly increased, and the essential differences between cities and villages, workers and peasants, can be gradually eliminated, and the living conditions in the countryside can be gradually made similar to those in the cities.

In order to improve the production enthusiasm of peasants, can we encourage peasants to freely rent and buy and sell land, freely do business, lend money, hire labor, and not impose any restrictions? This idea is also completely wrong. If we do this, we will be accommodating the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small peasants; the result can only be to fundamentally damage the worker-peasant alliance and frustrate the production enthusiasm of the majority of peasants. Naturally, we do not prohibit land renting and buying and selling, prohibit private business, or prohibit hiring labor and lending money; that is not the policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government in the countryside today. However, policies and laws also do not stipulate that this can be done without restriction. Comrades working in the countryside should carry out work in various aspects, help poor peasants overcome difficulties, so that they do not sell land or borrow high-interest loans; encourage peasants to develop production through mutual aid and cooperation, not to develop in the capitalist direction, and not to sell grain and other important agricultural products to private merchants. Peasants must be gradually made to understand that dividing the land into small pieces is a great obstacle to the development of production, and only by gradually transforming the individual ownership of the working people into collective ownership, collective labor, and joint use of land can production be increased, poverty be eliminated, and the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated. If we use the method of "ensuring" private land ownership to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, the result can only be counterproductive.

Is proposing the development of mutual aid and cooperation and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture now interfering too much with peasants, being impatient and rash, and hindering the worker-peasant alliance? This idea is also completely wrong. Naturally, being impatient and rash is not right; but it is by no means too early to put forward the slogan of implementing socialist transformation of agriculture now, and in fact this transformation has long begun in the past. It is completely necessary and completely possible to greatly advance the mutual aid and cooperation movement now. Failure to do so will make it impossible to greatly increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, and socialism cannot be built on two completely different and mutually opposed bases: on the one hand, socialist advanced large-scale industry, and on the other hand, backward small-scale peasant economy that constantly generates capitalism. How can a building, half built on stone and half built on sand, be balanced and stable?

Only by advancing along the general line and not leaving the general line for a moment can there be a consolidated worker-peasant alliance; and only by consolidating the worker-peasant alliance can the realization of the general line be guaranteed. Most of the workers in our country come from the countryside or still have homes in the countryside, and have a natural close relationship with the peasants. The Party organizations and trade unions in factories should educate workers to correctly understand the contribution of peasants to the country, better help the peasants, treat the peasants more kindly, and transform their own ideas as private owners that are the same as those of the peasants, so as to guide the peasants forward with socialist ideas. Peasants are not easily able to understand the lives and thoughts of workers, and often think that workers get a lot of wages and do very light work, and do not understand how much value workers create for the country, and do not understand that workers are working heroically. The Party organizations and rural workers in the countryside should introduce the specific situation of workers' production and life to the peasants in various ways, call on the peasants to support the cause of industrialization, learn the socialist ideas of the working class, and eliminate the peasants' misunderstandings about the lives of workers. In the old society, peasants were dissatisfied with "city people" because the bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists in the cities oppressed and exploited them. Now, our cities are no longer the exploiters and oppressors of the countryside, but the base from which the working class provides assistance to the countryside in terms of production and culture. It is necessary to educate the peasants to recognize this and eliminate the prejudices against "city people" that have been created for a long time in the old society.

Comrades working in the countryside must not fall into the trap of speculators, rich peasants, and grain hoarders, must not allow anyone to spread rumors and slander, sow discord between workers and peasants, and must not become captives of the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie. Peasants must also be vigilant and not be deceived and incited by speculative private merchants and reactionary elements. Implementing the general line is completely in line with the common interests of the working class and the laboring peasants. Workers and peasants must constantly consolidate the fighting alliance and advance firmly along the general line towards socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party!

### 巩固工农联盟是实现总路线的保证

    巩固工农联盟是实现总路线的保证
    工农联盟是我们的国家的基础，是我国人民革命胜利和国家建设胜利的保证。在人民民主革命胜利以前，我国的工农联盟是以共产党为代表的工人阶级领导农民为推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治而斗争的联盟；依靠这样一个联盟，我们才能坚持了长时期的革命斗争，终于在一个几万万人口的国家里取得了人民民主革命的胜利。在这一革命胜利，即中华人民共和国成立以后，我国的工农联盟就是以共产党为代表的工人阶级领导农民巩固人民民主专政、为过渡到社会主义而斗争的联盟。
    中华人民共和国成立以后的这几年，也就是过渡时期开始的几年，工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政已经发挥了巨大的作用。镇压反革命、抗美援朝等伟大斗争取得了辉煌的胜利；工业农业生产都恢复了、超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平；从一九五三年起，我们的国家已开始实行第一个五年计划，进入大规模的经济建设时期。经过几年来人民实际生活的发展，我国过渡到社会主义的总路线已经更加明确了。这时候，进一步巩固工农联盟就显得更加重要了。工人阶级面前只有一条路，这就是社会主义。农民的经济却是站在十字路口的：一部分农民相信只有继续跟着共产党走社会主义的路才能更加富裕，并且已经这样走了，那就是用互助合作的办法使大家都富裕起来的路；但也有一部分农民却在想着或在已经走着另外一条路：那就是企图用剥削别人的办法使自己发财的资本主义的路。农民，特别是中农，就是这样一个动摇不定的阶级：他们是劳动者，所以有走社会主义的路的愿望；他们又是私有者，所以也有走资本主义的路的愿望。因此，必须不断克服作为私有者的农民的资本主义倾向，不断巩固作为劳动者的农民和工人阶级之间的联盟。
    怎样使工农联盟更加巩固呢？
    要巩固工农联盟，首先就必须加强社会主义工业和整个社会主义经济。只有这样，才能更快地把农业改造成集体生产的、使用先进技术的、不断提高收获量、不断提高农民生活的大规模的农业。为此，工人们应该努力提高生产率、提高产品质量、降低成本，一方面现在就用物美廉价的生产资料和生活资料供给农民，一方面为国家积累资金，为将来以新式农具直至农业机器和电力供给农民作准备。农民们也应该积极增加生产，并且把生产品卖给国家，支援工业建设。
    要巩固工农联盟，就必须发动农民自愿地组织互助组和合作社进行生产。这不但是因为组织起来才能增加农产品的收获量、更多地支援工业建设、更多地改善农民生活；而且因为只有农业的合作化才能阻止农业中的资本主义发展，并且同社会主义的工业和商业巩固地结合起来。为此，政府和工人阶级要给组织起来的农民以思想上的指导和物质上的援助，农民也要努力沿着互助合作的道路前进。
    要巩固工农联盟，就必须和农村中的资本主义分子以及农民中的自发的资本主义倾向作斗争。“工农联盟只有在它是以反对那些由农民本身所分泌出来的资本主义分子的斗争为基础时，才能是坚固的联盟。”（斯大林：论联共（布）党内的右倾）如果我们不进行这种斗争，就是纵容投机分子侵害劳动农民基本群众的利益，其结果必然是破坏工农联盟。因此，必须发展供销合作，使农民经济和国家经济相结合，并且在粮食以及其他重要农产品的买卖过程中逐步排除私人商业的活动，防止少数农民变为剥削劳动人民的商人；必须用国家银行贷款和组织信贷合作的方式和农村中的高利贷者作斗争，防止少数农民变为高利贷者。供销合作、信贷合作做得好，能够帮助提高农业生产，限制农民内部分化，并且能使大多数农民更相信组织起来的好处，更积极进行农业的社会主义改造。
    要巩固工农联盟，还必须加强农村中党的组织工作。农村党员们时时刻刻要记着：农村党组织是工人阶级先锋队在农村的堡垒；虽然有些农村党员仍然过着农民的生活，难免还有许多农民思想，但必须不断改造这种思想，必须记着自己已经是工人阶级先锋队的光荣的战士，担负起自己在实现总路线中、在巩固工农联盟中的重大任务。我们主张的工农联盟，不是随便的一种工农联盟，而是在工人阶级领导下为实现总路线、为建成社会主义而斗争的工农联盟。通过工人阶级的先锋队加强工人阶级对于工农联盟的领导，这对于巩固工农联盟有极重要的意义。
    为了照顾农民的利益，是不是可以把工业的发展减少些，放慢些，让农民更多“休养生息”几年，然后再大搞工业建设呢？这种想法是完全错误的。我们必须首先着重发展工业特别是重工业，并且必须保持现在的工业发展速度，因为只有这样才能保证我国走向富强，人民走向幸福。不这样做，整个国家都要受损失，农民也要受损失。
    那么，现在就进行大规模的工业建设，会不会使农民“负担不起”呢？这种想法也是完全错误的。社会主义的经济法则和苏联几十年的实践都告诉了我们：社会主义的发展就是生产效率的不断提高和劳动人民物质福利的不断增长，这就排除了国家侵害农民的利益的任何可能。国家不会使农民负担过重，因为那不只是对农民不好，对国家、对社会主义工业、对工人阶级也都没有好处。如果那样做，那就是破坏了国家工业化的基础。事实上，我们国家并没有采取加重农业税、降低农产品价格和提高工业品价格的政策；而是恰恰相反，采取了稳定农业税、保持农产品的合理价格和逐渐降低工业品价格的政策。工业化的资金主要依靠国营企业自身的积累。我们国家的财政收入，国营企业和合作社缴纳的税和利润，一九五零年占百分之三十四点零八，一九五二年已经达到百分之五十六点三三，在今年预算中占百分之五十九点七九；农民缴纳的农业税，一九五零年占百分之二十九点六三，一九五二年占百分之十七点零八，在今年预算中只占百分之十四点五六。当然农民除了缴纳公粮以外还把大量粮食棉花和别的农产品卖给了国家，农民对国家是有功劳的；但国家收购农产品的价格是完全公平的，决不会让农民吃亏。
    是不是可以用降低城市劳动人民的生活水平、减少工人的工资的方法，来改善农民的生活呢？这种想法也是完全错误的。城市劳动人民的收入是他们艰苦劳动所得的报酬，并不是得之于农民，而且事实上他们的劳动所创造的价值有不小的一部分他们自己并没有得到，这一部分是变成了企业的利润和国家的财政收入，是用来扩大再生产了。假定真的减少一些工人的工资，那也只能妨碍工业建设的发展，对于比工人多几十倍的农民的生活是毫无帮助的。况且大多数工人的生活并不宽裕，他们的生活费用比农民高得多。农民生活的改善只有依靠农业生产的发展，特别是大规模农业生产的发展，而这又需要依靠工业的发展；只有这样，只有把分散的小农经济变成社会主义性质的合作化机械化的农业经济，才能大量增加农民的收入，并且逐渐消灭城市和乡村、工人和农民的本质的差别，逐渐把乡村的生活条件变得和城市差不多。
    为了提高农民的生产积极性，是不是可以鼓励农民自由地租佃和买卖土地，自由地做买卖、放债、雇工而丝毫不加限制呢？这种想法也是完全错误的。如果这样做，那就是迁就小农的自发的资本主义倾向；其结果只能是从根本上损害工农联盟，并且挫折大多数农民的生产积极性。自然，我们并不禁止土地租佃买卖，禁止私人做买卖，禁止雇工、放债，那不是共产党和人民政府今天在农村中的政策。但是，政策和法律也没有规定可以无限制地这样做。在农村做工作的同志们应当从各方面进行工作，帮助贫困农民克服困难，使他们不卖地、不借高利贷；鼓励农民用互助合作的方法来发展生产，不向资本主义方向发展，并且不把粮食和其他重要农产品卖给私商。要使农民逐渐懂得，把土地分割成小块，对于发展生产是极大的障碍，只有逐渐把劳动人民个人所有制逐渐变为集体所有制，集体劳动，共同使用土地，才能提高生产、摆脱穷困，也才能巩固工农联盟。如果用“确保”土地私有制的方法以求巩固工农联盟，其结果只能是适得其反。
    现在对农业就提出发展互助合作，进行社会主义改造，是不是对农民干涉过多，急躁冒进，是不是妨碍了工农联盟？这种想法也是完全错误的。自然，急躁冒进是不对的；但现在提出对农业实行社会主义改造的口号决不算过早，实际上这种改造在过去早就开始在进行了。现在把互助合作运动向前大大推进一步是完全必要的，也是完全可能的。不这样做，就不能大量地增产粮食和工业原料，社会主义不能建立在两个完全不同的互相对立的基础上：一方面是社会主义的先进的大工业，一方面是时时产生着资本主义的落后的小农经济。一个大楼，一半建筑在石头上，一半建筑在沙滩上，这怎么能够平衡，怎么能够稳固呢？
  只有沿着总路线前进，一时一刻也不离开总路线，才能有巩固的工农联盟；也只有巩固工农联盟，才能保证总路线的实现。我国大部分工人是从农村来的或者现在仍然家在农村，和农民有天然的亲密的关系。工厂的党组织和工会应当教育工人正确地认识农民对国家的贡献，更好地帮助农民，更亲切地对待农民，并且改造自己保留着的和农民相同的私有者的思想，以便用社会主义的思想引导农民前进。农民对工人的生活和思想是很不容易了解的，往往认为工人拿工钱很多、做活很轻闲，不了解工人为国家创造的价值有多大，不了解工人是在英勇地劳动。农村的党组织和农村工作者应该通过各种方式，把工人的生产、生活的具体情况介绍给农民，号召农民拥护工业化事业，学习工人阶级的社会主义思想，清除农民对工人生活的一些误解。在旧社会里，农民对“城里人”不满，是因为城市里的官僚、地主和资本家压迫和剥削了他们。现在，我们的城市已经再也不是乡村的剥削者和压迫者，而是工人阶级从生产上、文化上援助农村的基地了。必须教育农民认识这一点，消除他们在旧社会里长时期造成的对“城里人”的成见。
    在农村工作的同志们，决不能落入投机商、富农、粮食囤积者的圈套，决不能容许任何人造谣诬蔑、挑拨工农关系，决不能做小资产阶级自发势力的俘虏。农民们也要警觉起来，不要受投机私商和反动分子的欺骗和挑拨。实行总路线是完全合乎工人阶级和劳动农民的共同利益的。工人和农民要不断地巩固战斗的联盟，在共产党领导下坚定地沿着总路线向社会主义前进！
