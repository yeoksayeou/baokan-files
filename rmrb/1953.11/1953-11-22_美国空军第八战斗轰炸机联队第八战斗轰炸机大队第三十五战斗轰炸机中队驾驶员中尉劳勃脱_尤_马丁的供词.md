Confession of Lieutenant Robert Eugene Martin, Pilot of the 35th Bomber Squadron, 8th Bomber Group, 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, U.S. Air Force

My name is Robert Eugene Martin, Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number A O—1910991, born on August 21, 1929, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. On November 12, 1951, I arrived at the Suwon K-13 base in Korea and was assigned to the 8th Bomber Group. I was shot down over Heecheon on the morning of February 6, 1952. At that time, I had completed thirty-nine flight missions, and I was flying an F-80C aircraft.

I dropped germ bombs in North Korea. From January 17, 1952, until I was captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers on February 6, 1952, I carried out five missions to drop germ bombs, carrying a total of ten bombs. My second germ bomb dropping mission was to fly to the railway between Sunchon and Gunuri and drop the bombs next to the railway five miles south of Gunuri. On the other four occasions, I dropped the bombs about one hundred yards to the right of the railway, five miles south of Heecheon.

On the afternoon of January 16, 1952, I went to the squadron's operations room to see if there were any new developments and whether the people carrying out flight missions that day had all returned safely. I saw my name on the notice board, asking me to report to the squadron operations officer. He told me that I would be carrying out a special mission the next day and asked me to report to the group operations officer's office at 7:30 that evening to receive special mission instructions.

That evening, when I arrived at the group operations officer's office, there were already three pilots there. I knew one of them because he was in the same squadron as me, and he introduced me to the other two. We waited for about five minutes, and then the group operations officer came into the room. He began by saying:

"Gentlemen, first of all, I want to tell you that tomorrow you will be carrying special bombs." "Tomorrow," the major said, "you will participate in the usual briefing and find your targets from that briefing. When you go out to the planes, you will find your planes near the end of the runway. You will start your planes at the same time as the other planes in the group and taxi behind them. When taking off, do not climb higher than 10,000 feet. The group's planes will be flying higher than you. You will fly directly to the target area, but when you reach the calibration point, the group's planes will lower to the same altitude as you. You will follow them and drop the bombs you are carrying about one hundred yards to the right of the railway, five miles south of the city that you were told about during the briefing. As soon as you leave the target area, you will climb to a high altitude so that you have enough fuel to fly back."

"Now let's talk about the bombs," he continued, "Due to orders from headquarters, I cannot tell you much about them. But these bombs are germ bombs. The purpose of dropping these germ bombs is to spread disease to the people and any possible troops in the area, hoping to force the Korean people to surrender, and at the same time make supply transportation through the area dangerous. Dropping the germ bombs near the railway will cause the railway workers who come out to repair the railway to become infected with bacteria and get sick, delaying the repair of the railway. At the same time, because the bombs are not dropped on the tracks, they will be more difficult to discover and less likely to be destroyed."

"Now, if there are any questions, I am willing to try to answer them. Yes, if anyone thinks he should not drop these bombs, then remember that you are a soldier and should obey orders, and remember the punishment for not doing so."

Bill said, "Why were we chosen to carry out this mission?"

The major replied, "You have all completed at least twenty-five flight missions, and you are familiar with the routes in North Korea. With your experience, you can find the target and fly back on your own if necessary without getting lost. Don't worry, you will take turns carrying out this mission like everyone else, so it won't happen often. You must not talk to anyone about this. That's all I have to say. Dismissed." That's how the special briefing ended.

At 13:00 on January 17, I reported to the same office as before. The group operations officer was already there. Bill and the other two pilots performing the special mission followed closely behind. The operations officer briefly reminded us of what he had said the night before, saying, "Your target is Heecheon, use that big mountain as your calibration point. That's all."

I put on my flight suit and went to the tarmac. Two germ bombs were hanging under the wings where the thousand-pound bombs usually hung. When the group's twenty-eighth plane taxied out and passed us, we followed behind. So, I knew there were a total of thirty-two planes. After taking off, I felt better, but the ascent did not give me the usual excitement. Our squadron leveled off at 10,000 feet and formed a combat formation. At this time, the group's planes continued to climb to 25,000 feet. I immediately busied myself looking around and navigating, and it seemed like only a moment before I saw the big mountain overlooking the other mountains. I looked up and saw the group's planes descending to our altitude. At the same time, black smoke rings began to appear, indicating that anti-aircraft guns were firing at us. As the first batch of planes turned into a dive, all the planes were flying back and forth to avoid being hit by artillery fire. I followed my leader, and when I turned into a dive, I saw the valley below. The railway from Heecheon to Gunuri, parallel to a river, presented a peaceful scene.

The only thing that disrupted the harmony of this scene was the yellow-black smoke rising from the bomb explosions.

We dropped the germ bombs about five miles south of Heecheon, to the right of the railway. As I left the target and ascended, I looked back, but there was no explosion. At that time, my watch showed 15:10.

After that first mission, the remaining four were just like the first. On the days I carried out those missions, my mood was very low. But after the mission was over, I became active again, thinking that it might be the last time. Everyone seemed to have the same idea, "The less you talk about it or the less you think about it, the better."

On February 5, when I was carrying out my fifth germ bomb dropping mission, I asked the group operations officer, "Why am I carrying out these missions so frequently?" He said, "You can start your leave on the 9th, and you have to carry out these missions assigned to you, but don't worry, this is the last time before you return from Japan." So, I dropped two more germ bombs south of Heecheon.

In my opinion, the morale in the squadron was low, but it was difficult to say how people showed it, but this emotion often inadvertently revealed itself in small things. The pilots usually treated what they were doing as a game, and when they talked about the target, they talked about it like they were talking about a bullseye instead of property and people, in order to forget what they were doing.

    美国空军第八战斗轰炸机联队第八战斗轰炸机大队第三十五战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉劳勃脱·尤·马丁的供词
    我的名字叫劳勃脱·尤金·马丁，美国空军中尉，军号A O—1910991，一九二九年八月二十一日出生在密士失必州维克斯堡，一九五一年十一月十二日我到朝鲜水原K —13基地，被派在第八战斗轰炸机大队。我在一九五二年二月六日上午在熙川上空被击落。那时我已执行了三十九次飞行任务，我驾驶的是F —80C型飞机。
    我在北朝鲜投过细菌弹。自一九五二年一月十七日至一九五二年二月六日我被中国人民志愿军俘获止，我执行过五次投掷细菌弹任务，共带炸弹十枚。我的第二次投掷细菌弹任务是飞至顺川与军隅里之间的铁路，将炸弹投于军隅里以南五英里的铁路旁边。其他四次我将炸弹投于熙川以南五英里的铁路右方约一百码处。
    一九五二年一月十六日下午，我到中队作战室去看看有没有发生什么新情况，以及当天执行飞行任务的人是否都已安全地回来。我看到布告板上有我的名字，要我到中队作战官那里去报到。他告诉我第二天我将要执行一次特殊任务，叫我在当天晚上七时半到大队作战官办公室去报到，接受特殊任务简令。
    那天晚上，当我到大队作战官办公室时，已有三个驾驶员在那里了。我认识其中的一个，因为他和我同一个中队，他将我介绍给其他二人。我们约等了五分钟，大队作战官就进屋来了。他开始说：
  “诸位，首先我要告诉你们，明天你们将携带特殊炸弹。”“明天”，那个少校说：“你们将参加通常的简令，从这个简令中找出你们的目标。当你们出去上飞机时，你们将在近跑道的末端找到你们的飞机。你们和大队其他飞机同时发动飞机，并跟在他们后面滑行。起飞时，你们不要上升高于一万英尺以上。大队的飞机是要比你们飞得较高些，你们迳自飞向目标地区，但当你们飞到校正点时，大队飞机将降低到与你们同样的高度。你们跟着他们飞行，把所装炸弹丢在简令时告诉你们的城市之南五英里的铁路右方约一百码之处。一离开目标地区，你们就爬到高空，以便有足够的油量飞回来。”
       “现在来谈一谈炸弹”，他继续说：“由于司令部的命令，我不能告诉你们很多情况。但是这些炸弹是细菌弹。投掷这些细菌弹是为了对该地区的老百姓以及可能有的军队散布疾病，希望由此迫使朝鲜人民投降，同时使通过该地区的供给运输成为危险的事情。将细菌弹投于铁路附近，就会使出来修理铁路的铁道工人传染上细菌而得病，以延缓铁路的修复。同时由于炸弹不是投在轨道上，则炸弹比较难被发现，被销毁的可能性也就比较小。”
    “现在假如有什么问题，我愿意试作答复。是的，任何人如果认为他不应该投这些炸弹，那么记住，你是一个军人，应该服从命令，并记住不这样做时会受到的处分。”
    毕尔说：“为什么要选择我们来执行这个任务？”
    少校回答说：“你们至少都已执行了二十五次的飞行任务，你们熟悉北朝鲜的路线。以你们的经验，必要时你们能迳自找到目标和飞返而不至迷失方向。不要担忧，你们和其他的人一样轮流执行这种任务，所以不会常常轮到的。你们不得和任何人谈论这事情。我要讲的就是这些。解散。”特殊简令就是这样结束了。
      一月十七日十三时，我到原来那个办公室去报到，大队作战官已经在那里了。毕尔和其他两个执行特殊任务的驾驶员紧跟着走进来。作战官用简短的几句话提醒我们一下关于前一天晚上他所说的话，他说：“你们的目标是熙川，用那个大山做你们的校正点。完了。”
    我穿好飞行衣到停机坪道去。机翼下面平常挂一千磅炸弹的地方挂着两个细菌弹。当大队第二十八架飞机滑行出来，经过我们时，我们就跟在后面滑出。所以，我知道我们一共有三十二架飞机。起飞后，我感到好一些，但是升空后并没有使我感到一般的激动。我们的小队在一万英尺时拉平，编成战斗队形。此时，大队飞机继续爬到二万五千英尺。我立即忙着向四周了望及领航，好像只一刹那间，那俯视其他山头的大山就看到了。我往上看，看到大队飞机正在降低到我们的高度。与此同时，黑烟圈开始出现，显示出高射炮正在向我们开火。当第一批飞机转入俯冲飞行时，所有飞机正在来往飞行，以免被炮火击中。我跟着我的领队，当我转入俯冲飞行时，看到了下面的山谷。从熙川到军隅里的铁路与一条河流平行着的地方，呈现出一片和平的景色。
    唯一破坏这景色的和谐的是由于炸弹爆炸而升起来的黄黑色烟雾。
    我们把细菌弹丢在熙川之南约五英里的铁路的右边。当我离开目标往上升时，我回头看看，但是没有爆炸。那时我的时计是十五时十分。
    从那第一次任务后，其余四次正和第一次一样。在我执行那些任务的日子，我的情绪非常低落。但当任务一过以后，我又活跃起来，想到那可能是最后的一次了。每个人好像都有同样的想法，“愈少去谈论它或愈少想到它愈好。”
    在二月五日我执行第五次投细菌弹任务时，我问大队作战官：“为什么我如此频繁地执行这些任务？”他说：“你可在九日开始休假，而你又必须执行分摊给你的这些任务，但是不要耽心，这是你从日本回来以前的最后一次了。”于是，我又在熙川之南丢了两个细菌炸弹。
    依我的看法，中队里的士气很低，但是很难说人们是怎样显示出来的，不过这种情绪经常在一些小事情上不期然地流露出来。驾驶员们通常把他们所做的事情做为一种游戏，当他们谈到目标时，就像在谈靶心而不是财产和人民，借以忘掉他们正在做的事情。劳勃脱·尤·马丁（签名）美国空军中尉军号A O—1910991一九五二年八月二日（新华社）
