Strengthen Leadership in Promoting Advanced Experiences

	Organizing and leading the promotion of advanced experiences is one of the fundamental methods for overfulfilling state plans and increasing labor productivity. In recent years, various industrial sectors in our country have learned from a number of advanced Soviet experiences and have also created many experiences that are decisive for improving production. Among these are the rapid steelmaking and rapid steel rolling methods in the iron and steel industry, the rapid tunneling method in the coal mining industry, the high-speed cutting method in the machinery industry, the "Hao Jianxiu fine yarn work method" and the "1951 weaving work method" in the textile industry, the Su Changyou bricklaying method and the parallel flow operation method in capital construction, etc. These have been promoted nationwide and have greatly improved labor productivity. In addition, the successful technical reform of the anti-circumferential disc at the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has set off a mechanization movement throughout Anshan Iron and Steel and has become the direction for technical transformation of old factories and mines in our country.

	Although the work of promoting advanced experiences has achieved good results in some factories and mines, judging from the overall situation, this work has not attracted the attention of all factories, mines, enterprises, and capital construction departments. In particular, this work has been more universally neglected this year, and the work of promoting advanced experiences in many places has fallen into a state of stagnation and drift, with no one paying attention. According to a survey by the Shanxi Federation of Trade Unions, more than two-thirds of the factories and mines in Shanxi Province have been in a state of drift and stagnation in the promotion of advanced experiences due to lack of leadership. In the past, units such as the Shanxi Machine Factory had universally promoted high-speed cutting and multi-tool and multi-blade methods, but this year they have all or mostly stopped; Shanxi Coal Mine and Fujiatan Coal Mine used to have five mines implementing the longwall mining method, but now only one remains. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry inspected the promotion of 33 relatively important advanced experiences and found that the vast majority of units had not implemented these tried and tested advanced experiences.

	In the capital construction sector, the work of promoting advanced experiences is generally worse than in factories and mining enterprises. According to an inspection of thirteen engineering companies in Shenyang, the vast majority of construction sites have not implemented various advanced work methods.

	There are many reasons for this backward situation in the promotion of advanced experiences, but the key lies in leadership. Many departments, including their leading organs, have focused on central tasks such as planning management, technical management, and the responsibility system this year, which is certainly necessary, but it is wrong to oppose these central tasks to the work of promoting advanced experiences. Therefore, there has been no deployment or inspection of the work of promoting advanced experiences, resulting in drift and even cancellation. They have not realized that the work of promoting advanced experiences is a fundamental method for specifically relying on the masses to promote positive factors and improve the leadership level of enterprises. If only management reforms are implemented, and mass work is not strengthened accordingly, the wisdom of the masses is not developed, and various advanced experiences in technology and labor organization are not seriously summarized and promoted, then the construction work in production management will not be consolidated, and the production level of enterprises will not continue to be improved. Therefore, industrial, mining, transportation enterprises, and capital construction departments in various localities must quickly place the work of promoting advanced experiences in an important position and should lead their subordinate departments to conduct an inspection of the past work of promoting advanced experiences to find out the existing problems and solutions. Based on the results of the inspection, and closely combined with the central tasks of completing the production increase and conservation plan and preparing for 1954, and implementing planning management, technical management, and the responsibility system, advanced experiences should be promoted in a guided, planned, and purposeful manner.

	Doing a good job in various specific preparatory work is an important guarantee for closely combining the promotion of advanced experiences with current work and carrying it out in an orderly manner. Advanced experience is often a revolution in production. With its emergence, various imbalances will inevitably appear in production, and many new problems will arise. From balance to imbalance, and then from imbalance to a new balance, this is the inevitable law of development in the process of promoting advanced experiences, and it is impossible to try to avoid this imbalance. The responsibility of leadership is to be able to foresee this imbalance and to minimize the time of imbalance. This requires that various preparatory work be done in advance in production management and technical management according to the different contents of advanced experiences, such as the supply of materials and tools, the allocation of labor, quota management, etc. In the past, many units often suffered setbacks in the promotion of advanced experiences because they did not do this work well. After some capital construction sites in Shenyang implemented advanced work methods, the construction efficiency was rapidly improved, but because the construction management could not keep up, it resulted in a large amount of idle work and waiting for materials. Many advanced experiences were aborted halfway through the promotion process because production management or technical management could not keep up and could not timely adjust the imbalances in the production process. Some factories and mines have greatly advanced their production level because they can overcome this imbalance in the promotion process in a timely manner.

	In addition, to smoothly promote advanced experiences, old workers, technicians, and management personnel must be absorbed to participate in the work. Because today production has greatly developed, and the technical complexity has also increased, the combination of labor and technology has many new contents. Without mobilizing employees and technicians to participate, the work of promoting advanced experiences will inevitably encounter many difficulties. In the mechanization and automation movement carried out by Anshan Iron and Steel Company, old workers and technicians played a decisive role. Major inventions and technical improvements were almost all created or jointly created by old workers and technicians with more than ten years of service, and only a very few were proposed by technicians with more than five years of service. This powerfully illustrates the importance of mobilizing old workers and technicians.

	In the process of promoting advanced experiences, political work and organizational work must be strengthened in a practical way, so that special personnel are responsible. Generally speaking, our enterprise leading cadres understand the importance of these tasks, but there are still many weaknesses in the actual work in the past, such as not being good at using various flexible methods to guide the masses to learn, turning a blind eye to the ideological problems of the masses, and even adopting simple and crude educational methods for some backward workers, which often results in various false phenomena of "ostensible promotion but covert non-promotion." Therefore, in the process of promoting advanced experiences, effective education must be given in a timely manner according to the ideological situation of the workers. Since July this year, the Northeast has generally held advanced experience performance meetings and vigorously carried out publicity work. At the same time, the "Northeast Capital Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee" was established. These methods are worthy of learning and reference.

	Now, a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy is being launched across the country, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Leading organs of factories, mines, enterprises, and capital construction departments in various localities should seize this opportunity, and guide the masses in a timely manner to tap potential, find know-how, promote advanced experiences, improve the level of enterprise management, and strive to overfulfill this year's state plan.

### 加强对推广先进经验的领导

    加强对推广先进经验的领导
    有组织有领导地推广先进经验，是超额完成国家计划、提高劳动生产率的根本方法之一。我国各工业部门中几年来曾学习了若干苏联的先进经验，也创造了许多对改进生产有决定意义的经验，其中如钢铁工业的快速炼钢、快速轧钢法，煤矿工业中的快速掘进法，机械工业中的高速切削法，纺织工业中的“郝建秀细纱工作法”，“一九五一织布工作法”，基本建设施工中的苏长有砌砖法、平行流水作业法等等，都已推行全国，大大地提高了劳动生产率。此外，如鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂反围盘技术改革的成功，掀起了整个鞍钢的机械化运动，成了我国旧厂矿进行技术改造的方向。
    推广先进经验的工作，在某些厂矿虽然取得了很好的成绩，但就目前总的情况来看，这个工作还没有引起所有厂矿企业和基本建设部门的注意，特别是今年这个工作更普遍被忽视了，许多地方推广先进经验的工作陷于无人过问的停顿自流状态。据山西总工会的调查，山西全省约三分之二以上的厂矿，由于缺乏领导，使推广先进经验的工作陷于自流和停顿的状态。山西机器厂等单位，过去曾普遍推广了高速切削法和多刀多刃法，今年却全部或大部停顿了；山西煤矿和富家滩煤矿过去曾有五个矿实行了长壁式采煤法，现在却只剩下一个了。中央重工业部检查了三十三种比较重要的先进经验的推广情况，发现绝大多数单位都没有推行这些业已行之有效的先进经验。
    在基本建设部门中，推广先进经验工作一般的比厂矿企业更差一些，据沈阳市十三个工程公司的检查，绝大部分工地都没有实行各种先进工作法。
    造成推广先进经验工作这种落后状况的原因很多，但关键在于领导。有许多部门，包括他们的领导机关在内，今年抓紧了计划管理、技术管理和责任制等中心工作，这固然是必要的，但把这些中心工作和推广先进经验的工作对立起来，这就不对了。因此，对于推广先进经验的工作，既没有布置，也没有检查，结果形成自流以至取消。他们没有认识到：推广先进经验的工作，正是具体地依靠群众发扬积极因素提高企业领导水平的一个基本方法。如果仅仅是实行管理上的改革，而不相应地加强群众工作，发扬群众智慧，认真总结和推广技术上和劳动组织上的各种先进经验，那么生产管理方面的建设工作将不可能巩固，企业的生产水平将不可能继续得到提高。因此，各地工矿运输企业和基本建设部门，必须迅速把推广先进经验的工作摆到重要的位置上来，并应领导所属部门对过去推广先进经验的工作作一次检查，找出存在的问题和解决的方法，根据检查的结果，围绕着完成增产节约计划与一九五四年的准备工作，并与贯彻计划管理、技术管理和责任制度等中心工作紧密结合，有领导、有计划、有目的地推广先进经验。
    做好各项具体准备工作，是使推广先进经验与当前工作密切结合、有条不紊地进行的重要保证。先进经验往往是生产中的革命，随着它的出现，生产上必将出现各种不平衡现象，出现许多新问题。由平衡到不平衡，再由不平衡到新的平衡，这是推广先进经验过程中的必然发展规律，企图规避这种不平衡现象是不可能的。领导上的责任是要能预见这种不平衡，并尽量缩短不平衡的时间。这就必须事先根据不同内容的先进经验，在生产管理和技术管理上做好各种不同的准备工作，例如材料工具的供应、劳动力调配、定额管理等等。过去许多单位往往由于没有做好这个工作而使推广先进经验工作遭受了挫折，沈阳有些基本建设工地推行了先进工作法后，施工效率迅速提高了，但因施工管理跟不上，结果反而造成大量窝工和停工待料。许多先进经验在推广过程中由于生产管理或技术管理跟不上，不能及时调节生产过程中的不平衡现象，终于中途夭折。有些厂矿因为在推广过程中能够及时克服这种不平衡现象，就把生产水平大大向前推进了一步。
    此外，要顺利地推广先进经验，必须吸收老工人、技术人员和管理人员来参加工作。因为今天生产已大大发展了，技术上的复杂性也增加了，劳动与技术的结合已有了许多新内容，不发动职员和技术人员来参加，推广先进经验的工作必将遇到很多困难。鞍山钢铁公司在开展机械化、自动化运动中，老工人和技术人员起了决定的作用，重大的发明和技术改进几乎都是十年工龄以上的老工人和技术人员创造的或合作创造的，只有极少数是五年以上工龄的技术工人提出的。这就有力地说明了发动老工人和技术人员的重要性。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，必须切实加强政治工作和组织工作，使有专人负责。这些工作的重要性，一般说我们的企业领导干部是懂得的，但在过去的实际工作中仍存在许多弱点，如不善于运用各种灵活的方式来引导群众进行学习，对群众思想问题不闻不问，甚至对一些落后工人采取简单粗暴的教育办法，结果往往出现各种“明推暗不推”的虚假现象。所以，在推广先进经验过程中，必须根据工人的思想情况，及时给以有效的教育。东北各地从今年七月以来普遍召开了先进经验表演会，大力进行了宣传工作，同时，成立了“东北基本建设先进经验推广委员会”，这些方法都是值得学习和参考的。
    现在全国各地正热烈地展开增产节约竞赛，群众情绪都十分高涨，各地厂矿企业和基本建设部门领导机关应该抓紧这个机会，及时地引导群众挖掘潜力、寻找窍门、推广先进经验，提高企业管理水平，争取超额完成今年的国家计划。
