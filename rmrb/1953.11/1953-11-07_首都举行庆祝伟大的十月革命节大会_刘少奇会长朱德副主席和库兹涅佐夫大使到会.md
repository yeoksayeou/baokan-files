At 7:30 PM, amid the high strains of the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union played by the orchestra, Guo Moruo, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, announced the opening of the meeting.

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered a speech (the full text of the speech is published on page two of today's newspaper). He said: The Chinese people warmly celebrate the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people greeted with boundless joy and gratitude the results of the Sino-Soviet talks on Soviet assistance to China's construction this summer. In these talks, the Soviet government promised to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the renovation and construction of 141 large-scale projects in our country by 1959. He said: "Comrades can imagine what China will be like by 1959; at that time, we will be able to produce all kinds of the latest machinery ourselves to build and transform our industry; we will be able to produce tractors and other modern agricultural machinery ourselves to transform our agriculture; our national defense will be more consolidated; and the lives of our people will be further improved."

In his speech, Wu Yuzhang recalled the tremendous achievements of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation and cultural exchange in the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He also specifically mentioned the outstanding role played by Soviet experts who came to China at the invitation of our government to help with construction in various fields of our country.

Wu Yuzhang emphasized: The achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist and communist construction in all aspects are a great source of encouragement to the masses of the Chinese people. The great Soviet Union is a shining example for our construction. In the face of the general line and general task of our country's transition period, the importance of learning from the Soviet Union is even more prominent. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call: "Launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." He said: In order to learn well, we must overcome conservative thinking and complacency, and with high revolutionary enthusiasm and a scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, combine it with the tasks of national construction and learn sincerely and diligently. In addition, we must learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard struggle during the period of socialist construction to complete our new and great historical tasks.

Wu Yuzhang then pointed out: The great friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people is not only a reliable guarantee for accelerating our country's construction, but also the most powerful force for defending peace in the Far East and the world. There is no doubt that the strong unity of China and the Soviet Union will achieve greater success in the struggle for lasting world peace and the easing of international tensions.

Wu Yuzhang concluded: The strength generated by Sino-Soviet friendship is infinite and truly invincible. Any conspiracies and tricks of the imperialist warmongers will continue to be crushed in the face of our powerful friendly alliance. This is undoubtedly certain.

Soviet Ambassador to China Kuznetsov delivered a speech (the full text of the speech is published on page two of today's newspaper). Kuznetsov first thanked all the Chinese friends present and the leaders of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. He said: The Soviet people cherish the friendship of the Chinese people and believe that the unity of the two peoples is permanent, unbreakable, and unshakable. This unity not only conforms to the interests of China and the Soviet Union but also conforms to the interests of the people of the whole world. Next, Kuznetsov summarized the great international significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the significant achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of industry and agriculture. He particularly pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in implementing the firm policy of national industrialization, overcame many difficulties on the road to industrialization, using the strictest methods of economy to find funds to develop heavy industry in a short period of time. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union had to wage the fiercest struggle against enemies at home and abroad, breaking the enemies' frantic resistance and sabotage of the Party's general line. Despite these serious obstacles and difficulties, the Soviet people, encouraged and organized by the Communist Party, ultimately achieved significant achievements in the development of industry and agriculture. While Kuznetsov listed many powerful figures to illustrate these achievements and the improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of Soviet workers, he also mentioned some major policy measures currently being taken by the Soviet Union, such as, under the task of continuing to develop heavy industry, putting forward the task of rapidly increasing the development speed of the consumer goods industry, the task of expanding trade and improving trade organization, and the detailed resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on further developing agriculture. Subsequently, Kuznetsov analyzed and explained the current international situation and the Soviet Union's foreign policy. He pointed out that due to the active participation of millions of working people in the struggle for peace and against warmongers, and due to the great achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries, the international tension has been somewhat eased. However, it cannot be ignored that the various aggressive blocs headed by the US monopoly organizations are still stubbornly maintaining international tension, attempting to undermine the peaceful settlement of international disputes at any cost. However, all the conspiracies and arrogant attempts of US imperialism and its vassal states to dominate the world are doomed to failure. The selfless struggle of hundreds of millions of people to defend peace must undoubtedly achieve final victory, and the cause of peace will ultimately triumph. Next, Kuznetsov talked about the further consolidation of friendship between the Soviet Union and China. He said: The great significance of the sincere friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union must be pointed out. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era of sincere brotherly relations between the Soviet Union and China. The unbreakable and eternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is a great contribution to the cause of peace and the security of the people of all nationalities in the Far East and the world. Kuznetsov expressed special gratitude for the high praise received by the Soviet experts serving in various enterprises and institutions of the People's Republic of China, and expressed gratitude to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association for the great work it is carrying out in expanding cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and China. Kuznetsov concluded by saying: The Soviet people have set themselves the task of more extensively developing economic and cultural ties with the Chinese people and further consolidating the unbreakable and eternal friendship with the Chinese people for the benefit of our two peoples and for the benefit of all mankind.

After Ambassador Kuznetsov finished his speech, the meeting ended with the orchestra playing "The People of the World are of One Mind." After the meeting, the Central Experimental Opera House and the Soviet Friends Amateur Art Troupe performed many wonderful music and folk dance programs.

    七时三十分，在乐队高奏中苏两国国歌声中，中苏友好协会总会副会长郭沫若宣布大会开始。
    中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章讲话（讲话全文见今天本报第二版）。他说：中国人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年。中国人民以无限欢欣和感激的心情迎接了今年夏天中苏之间关于苏联援助中国建设的商谈结果。在这次商谈中，苏联政府答应到一九五九年的时期内，在我国改建与新建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程中给予系统的经济的和技术的援助。他说：“同志们可以想像，到了一九五九年那时候的中国将成为怎样的情形；那时候我们将能自己生产各种各样最新式的机器，来建立和改造我们的工业；我们将能自己生产拖拉机等现代化的农业机械，来改造我们的农业；我国的国防将更为巩固；我国人民的生活将能得到更进一步的改善。”
    吴玉章在讲话中追述了在中华人民共和国成立后的四年多来，中苏两国经济合作和文化交流的巨大成就。他并且特别提到应我国政府邀请来我国帮助建设的苏联专家在我国各方面的建设事业中所发挥的卓越作用。
    吴玉章强调指出：苏联的社会主义和共产主义建设的各方面的成就，对于我国人民群众，是一个巨大的鼓舞的力量。伟大的苏联就是我国建设的光辉榜样。在我国过渡时期的总路线和总任务面前，学习苏联的重要性就更为突出了。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召：“在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家”。他说：为要学习得好，就必须克服保守思想和自满情绪，而以高度的革命热情和科学的求实精神，结合国家建设的任务，诚心诚意地孜孜不倦地进行学习。除此以外，还要学习苏联人民在社会主义建设时期那种艰苦奋斗的精神，来完成我们新的伟大的历史任务。
    吴玉章接着指出：中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结，不仅是加速我国建设的可靠保证，而且是保卫远东和世界和平的最强大的力量。毫无疑问，中苏两国的坚强团结，在争取世界持久和平和缓和国际局势的斗争中将取得更大的成就。
    吴玉章最后说：中苏友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽的，是真正无敌的。帝国主义战争贩子们的任何阴谋诡计将继续在我们的强大的友好同盟面前被粉碎，这是肯定无疑的。
    苏联驻我国大使库兹涅佐夫讲话（讲话全文见今天本报第二版）。库兹涅佐夫首先向所有出席的中国朋友、中苏友好协会的领导人致谢。他说：苏联人民珍重中国人民的友谊，并且认为两国人民的团结是永久的，牢不可破的，不可动摇的。这种团结不但符合中苏两国的利益，而且符合全世界人民的利益。接着，库兹涅佐夫概括地叙述了伟大十月社会主义革命的巨大国际意义以及苏联在工农业发展方面的重大成就。他特别指出：苏联共产党在实现国家工业化的坚定方针时，曾克服了工业化道路上的不少困难，用最严格的节约方法寻找资金，以便在短期内发展起重工业。苏联共产党曾必须和国内外的敌人进行最激烈的斗争，打破敌人对于党的总路线的疯狂抵抗和破坏。尽管有这些严重的阻碍和困难，为共产党所鼓舞与组织的苏联人民终究在工农业发展方面取得了重大的成就。库兹涅佐夫在列举了许多有力的数字来说明这些成就以及苏联劳动者物质福利和文化水平提高的情况的同时，又提到了苏联目前所采取的一些重大的政策措施，如在继续发展重工业的任务下，提出急速提高生产消费品工业的发展速度的任务、扩展贸易和改善贸易组织的任务，以及苏联共产党中央关于进一步发展农业的措施的详细决议等。随后，库兹涅佐夫分析和说明了目前的国际情况和苏联的对外政策。他指出，由于千百万劳动大众积极参加争取和平反对战争贩子的斗争，由于苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的巨大成就，使国际紧张局势得到了若干缓和。但是不能忽视以美国垄断组织为首的各侵略集团，仍在顽强地保持国际紧张局势，企图用任何代价来破坏以和平方法解决国际争端。然而，美帝国主义及其附庸国家统治世界的一切阴谋和狂妄的企图是注定要失败的，几万万人民为了保卫和平而进行的忘我的斗争，毫无疑问，必须获得最后胜利，和平事业必将最终获得胜利。接着，库兹涅佐夫谈到苏中两国友谊进一步的巩固。他说：必须指出中华人民共和国和苏联两国之间的真诚友谊的巨大意义。伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了苏中两国之间真诚的兄弟般关系的新纪元。苏中两国人民之间牢不可破的永恒的友谊是对于和平事业和保证远东和世界各族人民安全事业的巨大贡献。库兹涅佐夫特别对于在中华人民共和国各企业和机关中服务的苏联专家们所受到的极高评价表示感谢，并对中苏友好协会在扩大苏中两国文化交流上进行着的巨大工作表示感谢。库兹涅佐夫最后说：苏联人民给自己提出任务——为了我们两国人民的利益，为了全人类的利益，更加广泛地开展和中国人民的经济、文化联系，更加巩固和中国人民的牢不可破的永恒的友谊。
    库兹涅佐夫大使讲话完毕，大会在乐队高奏
  “全世界人民心一条”的歌声中结束。会后由中央实验歌剧院和苏联友人业余艺术团表演了许多精采的音乐和民间舞蹈等节目。
