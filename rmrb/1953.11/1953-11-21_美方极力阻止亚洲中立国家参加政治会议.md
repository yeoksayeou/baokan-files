Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 19th: Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The constructive proposals further clarified by the Korean-Chinese side on the 19th regarding the form and membership of the political conference clearly illustrate that the reason why the Korean-Chinese side steadfastly insists that neutral countries must participate in the political conference is to ensure the smooth progress of the political conference and to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments pointed out that the political conference, adopting a form of equal meetings between the two sides with the participation of neutral countries, must have all its resolutions agreed upon unanimously by both sides, first and foremost by North and South Korea, and that the minority must never be coerced by the majority, or one side by the other. Relevant neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War, of course, cannot be considered as either of the belligerent parties. The importance of the participation of five relevant neutral countries – the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma – jointly invited by both sides in the political conference lies in their ability to mediate and assist the two sides in reaching an agreement conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to prevent the political conference from repeating the protracted stalemate of the past Panmunjom armistice negotiations.

Faced with the clear constructive proposals of the Korean-Chinese side, the US government representative Dean made a lot of impractical nice remarks to cover up his insult to neutral Asian countries and his attempt to prevent neutral Asian countries from participating in the political conference. Dean claimed on the one hand that the neutral Asian countries "know that we are their true friends,... we respect them too much,... we respect and esteem them," but at the same time he opposed these neutral countries participating in the political conference. He asked, "My God, what can they do as neutral countries that we cannot do?" "What exactly do we want them to do?"

Dean then insulted the neutral Asian countries, even comparing these neutral countries to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the lackeys of the United States, and implying that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang had even more right to participate in the political conference than the four neutral countries of India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma. Dean claimed that he wanted to "measure the distance from Taipei to Seoul and from Tokyo to Seoul, and then compare them with the distance from Jakarta, Rangoon, New Delhi, and Karachi to Seoul."

Dean finally repeated some inexplicable and self-contradictory questions he raised on the 18th. Dean's questions were so obviously intended to kill time that even the American propaganda machine was embarrassed to mention many of them.

### 美方极力阻止亚洲中立国家参加政治会议

    美方极力阻止亚洲中立国家参加政治会议
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝中方面在十九日所进一步阐明的关于政治会议的形式和成员问题的建设性建议，清楚地说明朝中方面之所以坚定不移地主张必须有中立国家参加政治会议，就是为了保证政治会议的顺利进行，为了有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    朝中政府代表指出：采取双方对等会议形式并有中立国家参加的政治会议，它的一切决议必须取得双方的一致同意，首先是南北朝鲜的一致同意，决不能以多数强制少数，或者是以一方强制另一方。没有参加朝鲜战争的有关中立国家，当然不能算是交战双方的任何一方。由双方共同邀请的五个有关中立国家——苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸参加政治会议的重要性，在于它们能从中斡旋，协助双方达成有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决的协议，使政治会议免蹈过去板门店停战谈判会议长期拖延的覆辙。
    面对着朝中方面的明白的建设性建议，美国政府代表迪安说了一大堆不切实际的漂亮话，来掩饰他对亚洲中立国家的侮辱和阻止亚洲中立国家参加政治会议的企图。迪安一面声称，亚洲中立国家“它们知道我们是它们的真正朋友，……我们太尊敬它们，……我们敬重和尊敬它们”，但同时他却又反对这些中立国家参加政治会议。他问道：“天哪，它们作为中立国家到底能做些什么我们所不能做的事？”“究竟我们要它们来干甚么？”
    迪安继而侮辱亚洲中立国家，他竟然把这些中立国家和美国的奴才蒋介石匪帮相提并论，并暗示蒋介石匪帮甚至比印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸四个中立国更有权参加政治会议。迪安声称他要“衡量一下从台北到汉城和东京到汉城的距离，然后再把它们和雅加达、仰光、新德里和喀喇蚩到汉城的距离加以比较。”
    迪安最后仍然重复他在十八日提出的一些莫名其妙、自相矛盾的问题。迪安的这些问题如此明显地只是为了消磨时间，以至于有许多问题连美国的宣传机器都不好意思提起它们。
