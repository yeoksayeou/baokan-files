    "Quartermaster"
    -- Random Notes from Guanting Reservoir, Part One
    Ding Ling

    When I walked out of the Hexi Library, I no longer felt the dryness of the autumn sun. A large group of young people cheerfully escorted me to the jeep. The young librarian, He Lianhua, with her two small braids, held my hand tightly. Some of the workers who were reading raised their heads to see us off, and some even followed us out, standing by the door to watch. This group of people surrounded me for a while, chattering away, I couldn't hear who was saying what, and I didn't know who to talk to. I smiled and waved at them, and said something, I don't know what, and later, I realized that I was smiling very foolishly. I got annoyed and wanted to say something smarter, but the car had already started. I turned back to look at them again, and I really couldn't express my envy for this group of young people. Look! They were so enthusiastic, so full of joy, full of the fresh air of early spring.

    "Are we going back to Hedong? It's almost dinner time," driver Lao Luo interrupted my thoughts, asking me this.

    "No," I said, "Lao Luo, do you know where Li Luoying lives? I promised to go to his place yesterday."

    "Which Li Luoying? The old man who checks the water level? I heard he lives under the suspension bridge, on the steep cliffs of Hexi, but I've never been there."

    "Then let's go," I said. I felt in my pocket, only two packs of cigarettes, so I asked Lao Luo to turn the car back to the cooperative and bought a dozen sesame cakes and a can of food.

    So Lao Luo and I bumped along this steep, winding mountain road, swirling with dust.

    From time to time, ten-wheeled trucks came from the opposite direction, some loaded with wood and stones, others empty, some from the Ministry of Railways, some from the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau, and some from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, all roaring, the wheels clattering, the yellow dust, like foam and mist, rushing from behind the opposite vehicles onto our faces and bodies.

    The car went around a mountain, saw the river, and then, hugging the mountain, went downstream along the river. The mountains were steep, the road narrow, and there were many stones, some places were newly repaired. There were many vehicles transporting equipment ahead, so we drove carefully and slowly, and often stopped. We passed not far beyond the suspension bridge, Lao Luo stopped the car next to a small house that I hadn't even noticed. This house was like a small sentry box, the door facing the river gorge, the back against the road, and the passing vehicles rolled back and forth close to the back wall of the house, with only enough room on both sides to barely park a truck diagonally. Lao Luo told me that we had probably arrived, so he led me to the front of the house and shouted loudly:

    "Li Luoying!"

    The door of the house was wide open, and Li Luoying was sitting by the bed, leaning over the table, writing. Even though we were so close to him, he didn't seem like he would raise his head unless someone called him loudly. He seemed very focused, concentrating all his energy on the notebook he was filling out.

    "Ha, Lao Li, we're here, you're so quiet!"

    He took off his reading glasses, tilted his head, squinted, and examined me, before giving a slight smile:

    "Oh! You really came!" Then he agreed with me: "Yes, it's quiet here, deafening all day long!"

    He stood up and busied himself for a moment, then picked up a kettle and rushed down the steep slope in front of the door like a young man. Lao Luo sat in front of the coal stove to light the fire, and the paper and wood gave off a faint smoke. I leaned against the window of this small house and looked out.

    The sun was about to set, and only a ridge of the high mountain opposite was still painted pale yellow. The mountains were covered with autumn grass, which rose and fell weakly in the gentle evening breeze. The water of the Yongding River flowed through the valley. In the distance, the sound of blasting mountains continued to come, and the sound of wheels behind the house mixed with the sound of flowing water into a cacophony. I stared at this familiar wilderness and listened to this unfamiliar noise in a daze.

    Li Luoying came back and they both gathered around the stove to boil water. I couldn't bear to leave the window, this mountain peak, these mountain ridges, these mountain hollows, winding around one mountain after another, the mountains within the mountains, this winding path, this precipice... aren't these all like the mountains I've walked through in Hebei, Shanxi, and northern Shaanxi? Aren't these also like the mountains on both sides of the Sanggan River that I've walked through? Those distant mountains and nearby mountains that I once had a relationship with all rushed to my eyes. I had indeed spent a long time wandering in such mountains, and now I was back to the old place again. Although there was still wilderness here, it was not remote, and all kinds of vibrations echoed in these tightly enclosed mountains.

    Li Luoying handed me the boiling water, and with the intention of breaking my silence, he smiled and said:

    "Do you like our mountain gully?"

    Driver Lao Luo also asked: "You probably haven't seen such big mountains, have you?"

    I looked at this thin old man, he didn't say much, quietly looking at me, with a hint of a smile on the corner of his mouth, his small, slightly red eyes, often flashing with exploratory and alert gazes. I asked:

    "Lao Li, did you have land reform here? What year was it?"

    "Land reform? We had it, it was in 1946!"

    "1946? I was in this area that year, I went to Huailai, Xinbaoan, and Wenquantun in Zhuolu, look, it's almost here."

    He smiled again, but that probing look was even clearer. So I told him a lot about the names of some villages and products in this area, and I affirmed that he must have watched sheep and been a shepherd. In places like theirs, the land was bad and there were many mountains, wasn't it perfect for grazing sheep?

    My affection for this mountain hollow immediately got a strong response from him. He no longer squinted at me, he also approached the window and swept his eyes across the mountains opposite. He said softly, as if to himself:

    "I'm not just a shepherd, but I'm also a quartermaster. Comrade Ding! Look, I know every plant, every tree, every stone on this mountain. I was cutting grass on this mountain when I was seven or eight years old, and I was scared by wolves; my parents are buried on this mountain. I was grazing sheep when I was a teenager, and I wore out so many pairs of shoes, but I also shed so much blood on it, we endured fright and fear. Alas! So many years, and I'm still alone here, guarding the mountain, sleeping on it, watching it, I run from this mountain to that mountain several times a day. Now there are so many people living on this mountain, tens of thousands of people working here when it's bustling, but only I, only I really understand this mountain, only I talk to it every day. Ha... finally, like it, we have the same fate..."

    "The same fate? What fate! What do you mean?"

    "Hey! Comrade Ding! Don't you understand? The mountain and I have both turned over, we are all working for the construction of the motherland, for complete industrialization!" The old quartermaster rubbed his hands, tilted his head, and looked at me meaningfully. I couldn't help but look at the forms he was filling out on the table. It was a water level record table, and he did write it very neatly.

    He walked around the room, which was only two or three steps, and then went back to the window. He pointed to a stone kiln on the opposite mountain, telling Lao Luo and me to look at it. We followed his finger for a long time, and saw a dark hollow, with a rocky edge above it, and we could imagine that there was a kiln there. Li Luoying said:

    "See it? That's the black kiln, I lived in it for two whole years!"

    Lao Luo also joined our conversation, he couldn't understand this sentence, he asked: "Why?"

    "Hey, the Home Returning Corps kept coming, and they robbed things every time! They wanted grain, don't you remember I'm a quartermaster? If they found it, it would be terrible!"

    "Are you a party member?" I asked him.

    "Of course I'm a party member. It's been a few years, I joined the party in 1944. That was still during the Anti-Japanese War!"

    Lao Luo stared at him, as if to say: "I didn't realize you were an old revolutionary!"

    Li Luoying walked away again, the room was too small, he stood by the door and looked out, the mountain color had turned dark purple. But the sound of stones being knocked, the sound of mountains being blasted open, and the sound of large transport carts rolling past one after another behind the house, still kept coming. I fell into contemplation. Li Luoying restlessly started walking again. Old quartermaster! What are you thinking? Your hard life, your struggling life, all your sorrows, struggles, dangers, and joys have all emerged, and are shaking your heart. At this time, I couldn't do anything, I just thought, I can't leave him, I want to stay with this director, sit together, quietly listening to the noise outside, and watching the mountain shadows that are gradually darkening, and still somewhat wild for the time being.

    At this time, a young man walked in from outside the door, about sixteen or seventeen years old. He didn't pay attention to us, went to the corner of the door, picked up the phone, and started talking to someone, after finishing talking, he ran to the table and flipped through the water level record table. The house had already darkened, and he couldn't see clearly, so he went to the corner of the door to press the switch, and suddenly, the electric light came on. The room was small, and the electric light seemed particularly bright, and the young man seemed to suddenly discover us, and was stunned, followed by a smile, not smiling at anyone, just as if he found it funny and laughed. Then he went to look at the water level table again, and asked: "Uncle Li, haven't you eaten yet?"

    This reminded Lao Luo and me, and we quickly opened the sesame cake bag, and Lao Luo went to the car to find a knife to open the can. Li Luoying went to boil water again, and the house was immediately busy, and the air immediately seemed lively and cheerful. Li Luoying introduced the young man to me. His name was Du Xin, and he was called Xiao Du for short, a migrant worker from Tianzhen County, hauling dirt, hauling stones, pushing wheelbarrows, and had worked for half a year. He was supposed to go back, but he didn't want to. He asked to stay and learn technology and become a worker. The person in charge of the reservoir agreed to let him stay and assigned him to the hydrological station as a trainee, rotating every two weeks, working with Lao Li to check the water level. He studied culture for one hour a day, business for two hours, and politics and current affairs for one hour. He had only been at the hydrological station for three months, but he was wearing a uniform and an octagonal hat, like a civil servant in an office, or what is commonly called a "little devil." Li Luoying finally added: "The young man is smart and has a future, there are three or four such people at the hydrological station, they take turns to work with me, I see that they are young and sleepy, so I let them be on duty for the first half of the night, and I take care of the second half of the night, the same during the day, I let them manage less, so that they can intensify their studies."

    The young man spoke: "Uncle Li sleeps less, he rarely sleeps in the first half of the night, I want to switch with him, but he won't, whatever he says has to be done, we all have to obey him, he's too strong-willed!" His criticism made us all laugh.

    We slowly ate the sesame cakes and beef, Li Luoying was polite for a moment, and then started eating too. Xiao Du ran down the cliff to the riverside to check the water level.

    Li Luoying became restless again, he felt that he hadn't been a good host, and felt very bad about eating the sesame cakes we brought. He walked around the room again, constantly looking under his bed, always seeming to have something to say to us, but suppressing himself. I asked him what he wanted, he didn't say, and sat down again. Finally, he tilted his head, squinted at us, smiled slightly, and said: "Comrade Ding! You see, I'm always an honest person, I always want to treat you to something, I have less than half a bottle of boiled wine, a specialty of our place, but I'm afraid you won't drink it, and I'm afraid you'll think I'm a greedy person. This was still brought to me by my nephew during the Mid-Autumn Festival, now that I have a job, I don't dare to drink it, so I put it under the bed. Today, alas! It's rare, and it's rare for you to come, you stayed in Wenquantun, so you can be considered a person from our place, we are all one family, we don't have anything else, we won't drink much, just one cup, Comrade Ding, what do you think? Don't laugh at me, will you?"

    He quickly bent down and pulled out a bottle from under the bed, making a nonchalant appearance, poured a full teacup, and the wine, as green as jade, immediately emitted an enticing fragrance. Li Luoying pushed the wine in front of me, and poured himself a small half bowl, and poured a small half bowl for Lao Luo. I felt that his narrow eyes were radiating an even gentler light, he stroked the green wine, looking from this cup to that small bowl. I didn't want to disobey his wishes, I raised my teacup and said: "Lao Li! Cheers to our new life."

    He took a sip, and then continued. He told us that during the Anti-Japanese War, our people often came, at least once a week, to send newspapers, send documents, and sometimes send cadres. He would take them across the railway to Chicheng Longguan. He described to us the tension of the railway blockade line, but nothing ever happened. He also told me who had lived here. Unfortunately, none of them were my acquaintances. I also knew a few people who had worked in Chabei, and they told me that they went through Nankou or Gubeikou.

    Guanting Village was a poor village, without even a small landlord, and not even a well-off rich peasant. The village only had fifty households, all good people, so the Eighth Route Army established a village government and developed party members not long after arriving. Li Luoying was not the first to join. Because the environment was good, district and township cadres often came down and stayed here. Sometimes they would stay for a night, and sometimes a few people would come to discuss things. Although it was a remote village, it was not backward, and there were no traitors or spies in the village. But it was also this kind of village that was often hated by the enemy, whether it was Japanese imperialism or the Kuomintang reactionaries, they were not polite to this kind of guerrilla area, or marginal area, and would come to extort something every few days, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries. After 1946, he didn't dare to sleep in the village for two years.

    Lao Luo and Xiao Du listened to the story in a daze, all these things were very new to them. They didn't know the life of the people in the old revolutionary base areas before, and they couldn't help but increase their respect for this quartermaster, listening quietly.

    Li Luoying had already drunk the wine in his bowl. His chatterbox was opened, like the water of the Yongding River, unstoppable, he slowly sighed again: "Comrade Ding! I don't want to bring up this matter, in November 1946, one night, it was very cold, so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. The sentry on our hilltop was so cold that he had to walk back and forth, but when he walked forward again, the sky was slowly dawning, and he suddenly saw that people had already touched the hilltop of the village. He quickly fired a shot and ran towards the back mountain, at that time we were all still sleeping, we couldn't even bother to put on our clothes before running out. The fast runners got on the mountain, and the slow runners couldn't run out, the enemy had already surrounded the village. It was the Home Returning Corps! There were more than 300 people. At this time, two district and township cadres happened to be sleeping in the village, they also got on the mountain, but they went the wrong way, and went to the cliff. The Home Returning Corps was chasing after them. It turned out that the village secretary was leading them, but it wasn't very bright, they were running in a hurry, and they didn't keep up, so they went on a dead end. They looked at the back, the enemy was already approaching, and in front was a steep cliff, and below was the water of the Yongding River, they didn't want to be captured, so they jumped down, they jumped off the cliff and died, the village was in a mess, the Home Returning Corps robbed everything they could eat, and we didn't dare to sleep in the village from that time on. Later, after the village was robbed, they came to smash the pots, all the pots, jars, cans, and bowls in the whole village were smashed, and we couldn't cook anything for ten days... These things, in theory, have passed for a long time, now whose life is not better? Sometimes we are very busy and can't think of these things, sometimes we always look ahead, the children's future will be beautiful! But I don't know why, some things can't be forgotten, and my heart still hurts when I think of them. Comrade Ding! These damned reactionaries, of course, some have been caught, but there are still those who are at large, like Jiang Jieshi, we hate him, we just hate him..."

    I didn't know what to say, I also thought of several village cadres and active farmers in Wenquantun, who were also killed by the reactionaries that year. The shadows of these people also floated into my mind, and became even clearer.

    A loudest tremor came from the distance, probably the Ministry of Fuel Industry had blasted a larger area of the mountain open, and we seemed to have returned to the real world. I went to the door to look, on the downstream side where the dam was being built, searchlights and mercury lamps shone like daylight, a snow-white light. On the mountain road behind the house, the electric lights also illuminated the road brightly. The transport vehicles still kept coming and going. I went back to help them clean up the table, I said to Xiao Du: "Xiao Du, we have to be like that road roller, heavily pressing the stones, steadily moving forward, we must always remember this hatred, we will use victory to heal the wounds, you must study hard, work hard, listen to Uncle Li, he is happy when he sees you strong, and he will forget the past."

    "Li Zhiguo studies much better than me, he has won a learning model once," Xiao Du told me.

    "Who is Li Zhiguo?"

    "He is in the sediment testing room, that job requires patience, he is about the same age as me, we are very good..."

    Lao Luo didn't let Xiao Du continue, and抢着 said: "Why don't you say clearly who he is. Li Zhiguo is Lao Li's son, a very smart child. He has been at the hydrological station longer than you, of course he is stronger than you, you will catch up with him in a while."

    Li Luoying's face suddenly brightened, a layer of gray clouds was driven away, and he smiled at me sweetly. I also said: "You are so lucky! Only one son?"

    "No, there is also a daughter."

    Xiao Du took out a photo from the drawer and stuffed it to me. This was an extremely young girl, with two braids hanging down, wearing a floral shirt, imitating the decorations of rural women in current movies, looking very generous. I asked Lao Li if his daughter was also working at the reservoir engineering bureau. Lao Li told me that they had argued about this matter for a long time, and had even held a family meeting. His opinion was to stay in Guanting to work, learn to be a worker, and find a worker as a "partner" in the future. But her mother didn't agree, because the people of Guanting Village had all moved to Xinbaoan, where a new village was built, five new houses were built for their family, and there were a few acres of good land. The old woman said that everyone was going to industrialization, and no one would farm the land, so she wanted to keep her daughter at home to farm, and she still wanted to find a farmer son-in-law. I asked what her daughter's own opinion was, everything should be decided by herself. Lao Li smiled even more, he said: "She said it well, saying that the countryside will also be industrialized in a few years, she doesn't oppose industrialization, she will stay in the village to drive a tractor in the future. Listen, how nice it sounds, hum! Later I found out that she had already found a 'partner' herself, not a farmer."

    Xiao Du then told me that Li Luoying's cousins Li Luoping and his nephew Li Zhimin were both workers in the repair shop, and two other people in his family had participated in the project work as soon as the reservoir was built. They have now left the reservoir engineering bureau and been transferred to other places.

    Lao Li's expression changed again, indescribably satisfied, but still maintaining his slow, leisurely manner, he said: "A total of more than twenty people from Guanting Village have transferred to other industries, all following the construction of the reservoir into industry. They are all young people, all stronger than me, they not only work, but also learn technology. Our Li Luoping learned to operate the lathe in one year, and is now training apprentices!"

    I thought of everything I had seen at the repair shop the day before. There were only fifty or so workers left there (because the project was almost finished, some people had been transferred to other places). Only a few were old workers, all were young people, and two female migrant workers were also learning there. Li Luoping was responsible for the technical learning of one female migrant worker. Li Luoping wore suede shoes and blue worker's clothes, like a middle school student coming to work, not at all like the rural children. I simply didn't expect that he was originally a child from this poor rural area of Guanting Village. While saying that I had seen him and agreed with their praise of him, I was amazed by this change. The pace of the times was too big, I seemed to hear this sound, although I didn't hear it today, although I always walked in accordance with this rhythm, but I still often vibrated for this tight rhythm and intense sound.

    It was too late, and I didn't want to interfere with their work too much, so I said goodbye to them. Li Luoying, without waiting for me to finish, accompanied me out of the small house, and was the first to step into the jeep. He said he wanted to send me back, he wanted to go to the construction site, he said he liked to walk there. That brightness, that fiery atmosphere, was a place he couldn't even dream of, he described it as heaven.

    Our car went back along the mountain again, on the narrow road. Because it was night, the horn sounded even louder, and at this time nothing could be heard clearly. Wooden frames were tied to several cliffs, only workers who tied scaffolding in Beijing could tie this kind of frame, they could hang high in the air, but it was very strong, could carry heavy loads, and it was very convenient for people to climb up and down on the frame. They didn't stop working at night, they turned on searchlights, and people were hanging on the frame to work, the shadows on the frame, like patterns, were pasted on the cliff, what a magnificent scene!

    The car slowly headed towards the most lively place, the brightest place, and we could already hear the music being broadcast on the loudspeaker, and we could already hear the sound of the concrete mixer. The old man couldn't hold back anymore, he leaned his head over behind me and said loudly: "Comrade Ding! Look! This is our old place! Look what it looks like now. Look how hard people are trying to change this place!"

    The car stopped in front of the head of the flood control dam, and the car could no longer move forward. My residence was in Hedong, and I had to walk back through the dam (which is still a construction site), I had to walk back from this 290-meter-long dam surface. I had to pass through thousands of people, pass through countless lines of people carrying dirt, carrying sand, carrying stones, sprinkling water, and tamping the earth, I had to bypass many road rollers, and I often couldn't find my way, lost in the crowd. Every day I had to pass through this dam, it was a maze, and when I got here I forgot everything, I forgot myself, and I became as small as a pinch of soil, a grain of sand, and there was no self.

    After saying goodbye to Lao Luo, Li Luoying and I walked to the construction site with the same mood, he held me tightly, afraid that people would separate us, but being together made it even more difficult for others, so we often had to separate.

    The young lads, in the night scenery, in the night scenery where the electric lights were as dense as stars, under the strong mercury light, in the thousands of noises merged into one sound, seemed more energetic than during the day. They strode forward, running, going back and forth in rows, transporting soil and sand like shuttles... They ran even more cheerfully with the music from the loudspeaker, the shouting of the tampers, and the clattering of the road rollers. Some of them wore the turn-down collar shirts they had bought, and some wore the eye-catching red cloth vests popular in Yanbei. They sometimes greeted acquaintances, sometimes encouraged others, and shouted as if challenging people. Most of these people were farmers from various counties in Hebei, but I felt that they were both familiar and unfamiliar to me. Although they were hauling soil and pushing wheelbarrows, their faces were full of lively breath, they were not restrained, they were flexible, they often had a demanding and interacting manner, they were enthusiastic, and they didn't want to hide their new joy and courage. Some people knew Lao Li, and saw Lao Li walking with me, so they spoke to Lao Li and asked who I was. Some people who knew me smiled at me. I had to look at these people, and I had to be careful not to bump into people, and I had to pay attention to my feet, sometimes walking on gravel roads, sometimes walking on sandy roads, and sometimes stepping on wet mud. We also seemed to be participating in labor, participating in the battle, walking through nervously.

    Even though we had walked through, we arrived at the eastern end of the dam, standing at the starting point of the spillway, but it was still crowded with people here. Li Luoying and I looked up at each other, and at this time we didn't talk, and we didn't even exchange glances, but we understood each other very well. Under such circumstances, we could only lower our heads. Li Luoying still couldn't help but break the silence, and he said again in that soft tone, slowly, as if to himself:

    "Comrade Ding! Do you know where we are standing? Under our feet, is the old Guanting Village, the place where I have lived since I was a child. Look, now this village is gone, not even a shadow of it is left. What do you think I should think? Hey! Comrade Ding, completely overthrow those poverty, those conservatism, those feudalism all root out. This is concrete, and behind is the new Guanting Village, not exactly high-rise buildings, but neat, freshly painted, and inhabited by people building happiness. Look again, on both sides of this Yongding River, what kind of world is this! There are more electric lights than stars, brighter than crystals, and the people who visit say it's like Shanghai, like Chongqing... I haven't been to those places, maybe they are prosperous, but what kind of people are here? What kind of things are happening? It's moving mountains and overturning seas, it's some heroes who have no self, one heart to work for the construction of the motherland. Is there enjoyment here? Labor is enjoyment; is there honor here? Labor is honor; is there love here? Labor is love. Comrade Ding! I have gone from that world, the old world, to the present, watching the changes, what do you say is the feeling in my heart?"

    I didn't look at him, and I didn't speak, I didn't want to interrupt him. After a while, Li Luoying spoke again, his voice became louder:

    "What is the Communist Party, I can't explain it fully, because I haven't read much, but I understand that the party wants everyone to have happiness, and for everyone's happiness, to try to take out their own things and their own strength. We are old, we now look at the water level, just looking at the water level is not enough, we have to study, we have to improve, we have to help people, I have to take out these old bones of mine, and not let the young people walk ahead. I have already seen that Guanting Village has changed, it will get better next year, it will get even better the year after that, I am here, my home is here, and it will get better and better. But if someone asks me in the future, what strength did you use? I want to be able to answer, I don't want my heart to be uncomfortable, to feel that I have not been stingy, I am like many people, I have not come empty-handed. Don't look at me so dry and thin, it's all the suffering I've endured in the past, I'm only fifty-six years old this year. I am happy in my heart, I still have many years to serve the people. Comrade Ding! It's getting late, I'll send you a little further, you should rest too."

    I don't know why, but I felt too excited. I didn't want to go back at all, I looked far away, to the outside of this mouth, to the far away, misty place, I thought: "Yes, the old Guanting Village, the poor Guanting Village that has gone through many years of struggle, is gone, completely gone. Here is a broader, new, happy world. The lakes and mountains have become more beautiful, and the people have become more lovely; the difficult life of the quartermaster has passed, and Li Luoying has become a more energetic, fulfilling, and understanding water level warden..."

    I turned back to look at him again, he was standing so kindly beside me, staring at the crowd on the dam, sometimes looking at me again. I finally said: "Let's not send each other off. If I have time in a few days, I'll go to your place again."

    Li Luoying agreed with my suggestion, and we parted. But I didn't leave, I looked at his back shadow, he was covered by the crowd, but then I saw him again, I seemed to see his spirit-like thin body appearing and disappearing in the crowd forever, he stroked many people with his slightly shimmering, somewhat moist eyes.

    I don't know when I returned to my residence.

                    November 1953

    “粮秣主任”
    ——官厅水库散记之一
    丁  玲
    我从河西图书馆走出来的时候，已经不再感到秋天太阳的燥热。一大群年青人，欢跃的把我送到吉普车旁边。年青的馆长何莲花，垂着两个小辫，紧紧的握着我的手。有些看书的工人们都抬起头来送我们走过，有些人也跟着走出来，站在门旁边来看。这一群把我包围了一会的人们，七言八语的，我听不清谁在讲什么，我也不知道该和谁说话。我望着他们笑、挥手，也说了不知什么话吧，后来，我发现自己笑得很傻，我生气了，想再说点聪明话，可是车子已经开动了。我回过头来再看他们，真说不出我对这群年青人的羡慕。看啊！他们是那样的热情，那样的洋溢着欢欣，洋溢着新鲜的早春之气。
    “是不是我们回河东去？快开晚饭了。”司机老罗把我的思想截断了，他这样问我。
    “不”，我说：“老罗，你认识李洛英的住处么？我昨天和他约好要去他那里。”
    “哪个李洛英？是那个看水位的老头么？听说他住在吊桥下面，河西的陡岩上，可没去过。”
    “那末我们就去吧。”我摸了摸口袋，只有两包烟，我便叫老罗把车弯回合作社，买了十几个烧饼和一个罐头。
    于是我和老罗又在这条陡的、弯曲的、飞舞着尘土的山路上颠簸了。
    不时从对面开来一些十轮卡车，也有装木头、石块的，也有空车，有的车是铁道部的，有的车是官厅水库工程局的，也有燃料工业部的，横竖是吼着，车轮子轧轧的响，喇叭不断的叫，那些像水沫、像雾似的黄尘，从对面的车身后边扑到我们脸上、身上。
    车子绕过了一座山，看见了河，又靠着山，沿着河边往下游走。山很陡，路很窄，石子很多，有些地方是刚刚修补好的。前面运器材的车子很多，我们走得又小心，又慢，还常常停住。我们走过了吊桥不多远，老罗就把车子停在路旁一个我一点也没有注意到的小屋旁边。这屋就像一个小岗亭，门临河峡，背后就是路，来往的车子就紧贴着屋子的后墙轧轧的滚去滚来，屋的两边都只能勉强斜放一辆卡车。老罗告诉我可能到了，于是他引我转到屋前，并且高声叫：
    “李洛英！”
    屋门是大敞开的，李洛英正坐在床铺边，伏在桌子上写字呢。虽说我们离他那样近，如果不是有人大声叫他，他是不会抬起头的样子，他好像很用心，把全部心神都贯注在他填写的本子上。
    “哈，老李，咱们来了，你倒好安静！”
    他取下了老花眼镜，歪着头，细眯着眼，对我审查的看了一下，才微微一笑：
    “嗯！真来了！”接着又答应我：“对，这里就是个静，一天到晚连耳朵都震聋了！”
    他站起来张罗了一下，提了一把壶从门前的陡坡上像个年青人似的直冲下去了。老罗坐在煤炉前去烧火，纸和木材发出微微的烟，我凭着这小屋的窗洞望了出去。
    太阳快下山了，对面高山上只留下一抹山脊梁还涂着淡黄。满山遍岭一片秋草，在微微的晚风中，无力的，偶尔有些起伏。峡谷里流着永定河的水流。更远的地方不断的传来炸山的轰隆声，屋后的车轮声与流水声混成一片杂音。我凝视着这熟悉的荒山和听着这陌生的喧闹出神了。
    李洛英回来了，他们两人围着炉子烧开水。我舍不得离开窗洞，这山峰，山梁梁，山凹凹，绕过一个山头，又一个山头，这山里面的山，这羊肠小道，这崾嶮，……这些不都像我在河北、山西、陕北所走过的那些山一样的么？这不也像我所走过的桑干河两岸的山一样的么？那些曾经与我有过关系的远的山，近的山，都涌到我眼前，我的确有很长的时间是在这样的山中转过的，现在我又回到老地方来了。这里虽然也还有荒野，却并不冷僻，各种的震响在这包围得很紧的群山里面回荡。
    李洛英把开水给我递了过来，并且有心打破我的沉默，他笑道：
    “中意了咱们这山沟沟么？”
    司机老罗也问道：“怕没见过这大山吧？”
    我望着这瘦骨稜稜的老汉，他不多说话，静静的望着我，嘴角上似乎挂着一点似笑非笑的神气，细小的，微微有些发红的眼睛，常常闪着探索和机警的眼光。我问道：
    “老李，你们这里有过土改么？是哪一年土改的？”
    “土改？搞过，是一九四六年呀！”
    “一九四六年土改过？咱那年就在这一带，我就到过怀来，新保安，涿鹿的温泉屯，你看，就差不多到了这里。”
    他又笑了，可是那种探索的眼光也看得更清楚了。我就把这一带的一些村名和出产说了很多，我并且肯定的说他一定看过羊，做过羊倌。像他们这地方，地不好，山又多，不正好放羊么。
    我对于这山凹的感情，立刻在他那里得到浓烈的反应。他不再眯着眼睛看我了，他也靠近窗洞，把眼光横扫着对面的大山。他轻轻的说，就像是自语似的：
    “我不只是个羊倌，而且我还是个粮秣。老丁同志！你看吧，这山上的一草一木，一块石头，我都清清楚楚。我打七八岁就在这山上割草，被狼吓唬过；我的父母就埋在这山上。我十几岁就放羊，走破了多少双鞋子，可也流了多少血在上面，咱们担过惊，受过怕。唉！多少年了，我现在还一个人留在这里，守护着山，睡在上面，看着它，那一天不从这座山跑到那座山去几趟。如今这山上住的人可多了，热闹的时候几万人在这里工作，可是只有我，只有我才真真懂得这山，只有我才每天同他说话。哈……总算和它一样，咱们是一个样样的命……”
      “一个样样的命？啥命啊！你这是什么意思呢？”
      “嘿！老丁同志！你还不懂得么？山和我一样翻身了，咱们全为着祖国建设，全工业化啦！”老粮秣主任搓着手，歪着头，意味深长的望着我，我不觉的把眼光落在桌子上他填写的单单上面。那是一张水位记录表，他的确写得很工整呢。
    他在屋子里来回走了一个圈，也就是走了两三步，就又踅回到窗洞前边。他用手指着对面山上，教我和老罗看一个石窑窑，我们顺着他的手指找了半天，看见一团黑凹凹的地方，上边有一道岩石的边缘，可以猜想出那里有一个窑。李洛英说：
    “看见了吗？就是那个黑窑窑，我可在那里边住了够二年啦！”
    老罗也转入到我们的谈话里边了，他无法理解这句话，他问道：“为什么？”
    “嘿，还乡队不断的来嘛，他们那一次不抢走些东西！他们要粮嘛，你不记得我是一个粮秣么？要给他们找到了还了得！”
    “你是党员么？”我问他。
    “当然是党员啦。还有些年头了，一九四四年就入党了。那时还是抗日战争年代啦！”
    老罗紧望着他，好像在说：“瞧不出还是老革命啦！”
    李洛英又走了开去，屋子太小，他站在门旁朝外望，山色已经变成暗紫色了。可是铿铿的石头被敲打的响声，山在被炸开的响声，运输的大板车轧轧的在屋后一辆跟着一辆过去的声音，仍旧不断地传来。我落在沉思中去了。李洛英不安的又走了起来。老粮秣主任啊！你在想什么呢？你的艰苦的一生，奋斗的一生，你所有的愁苦、斗争，危险和欢欣都同时涌现了出来，都在震动着你的心灵吧。我在这个时候什么也不能做，我只想，我不能离开他，我愿意和这个主任同在下去，坐在一道，静静的听着外边的噪杂，和看着渐渐黑了下去的暂时仍然有些荒野的山影。
    这时从门外走进来一个年青人，大约十六七岁吧。他并不注意我们，走到门角落拿起电话就不知和谁说开了，一说完又跑去桌边拿着水位记录表就翻。房子里已经黑下来了，看不清，他就又走到门角落里去按电门，猛的一下，电灯亮了。屋子小，电灯显得特别明亮，年青人好像忽然发现了我们，就呆住了，跟着也露出一丝笑容，并不是对任何人笑，就好像自己觉得好笑就笑了起来似的。跟着他就又去看水位表，并且问：“李伯伯，你还没有吃饭吧？”
    这才把我和老罗提醒了，我们赶快打开烧饼包，老罗又到车上找刀子开罐头。李洛英又去烧开水，房子里立刻忙了起来，空气也就立刻显得活跃而热闹了，李洛英又替我介绍了这年青人。他的名字叫杜新，简称他小杜，是从天镇县来的民工，挑土，挑石头，推斗车，做了半年工，本来该回去了，可是他不愿意，他要求留下来学技术，做工人。水库上负责人同意他留下，把他分配在水文站做学员，两个星期轮一次班，同老李一道看水位。每天学习一个钟头文化，两个钟头业务，一个钟头政治和时事。他留在水文站才三个月，可是他穿着制服，戴着八角帽，像一个机关里的公务员，也就是通常说的“小鬼”。李洛英最后还加添说：“年青人聪明，有前途，水文站上这样的人有三四个，他们轮流来和我搭伴，我看他们年纪轻，瞌睡大，让他们上半夜值班，我管下半夜，白天也是这样，叫他们少管些，好加紧学习。”
    年青人说话了：“李伯伯就睡得少，上半夜他也很少睡着，我要和他换，他不干，他怎么说就得怎么作，咱们全得依他，他个性太强了！”他的批评使我们都笑了。
    我们慢慢的吃着烧饼和牛肉，李洛英客气了一下，也就吃起来了。小杜跑到崖下边，河边上看水位去了。
    李洛英又不安起来，他觉得他没有做主人，而吃着我们带来的烧饼，很过意不去。他又在屋子里走着，时时望着他的床底下，总好像有话想同我们讲，又压抑着自己。我问他要什么，他不说，又坐了下来。最后他把头歪着，细眯着眼望我们，微微笑着说：“老丁同志！你看我总算是老实人，我总想款待你一点东西，我还有少半瓶煮酒，是咱们这地方的特产，可又怕你不吃，又怕你以为我是个贪杯的人。这还是过八月节我外甥替我捎来的，我现在有工作，怎么也不敢吃，就放在床底下。今日个，唉！少有，你也难得来，你在温泉屯呆过，也就算咱们这地方的人了，大家都是一家人，咱又没有别的，不喝多，喝一杯，老丁同志，怎么样？不笑我吧？”
    他迅速的弯身下去，从床底下抽出一个瓶子，做出满不在乎的样子，倒了满满一茶杯，像碧玉一样绿的酒立刻泛出诱人的香气。李洛英把酒推到我面前，又自己倒了小半饭碗，给老罗也倒了小半饭碗。我觉得他的细细的眼睛里更放射出一道温柔的光，他抚摸着绿色的酒，从这个杯子里望到那个小碗里。我不愿违拂他的意思，我举着茶杯说：“老李！为我们新的生活干杯吧。”
    他呷了一口，便又说下去了。他告诉我们在抗日战争时期，咱们的人常常来，一个星期至少走一趟，送报纸，送文件，有时是送干部。他就带他们过铁路，到赤城龙关去。他为我们描写过铁路封锁线的紧张，但是从来也没出过事。他又告诉我什么人住在这里过。可惜没有一个是我的熟人。我也认识几个到察北工作过的人，而他们告诉我走的是南口或者古北口。
    官厅村是个穷村，连个小地主也没有，真真够得上富农的也没有。村子只有五十来户人家，都是好人，所以八路军没来多久就建立了村政权和发展了党员。李洛英还不是最先加入的。因为环境较好，所以区乡干部下来了就常常住在这里。有时来弯一夜，有时来几个人商量点事。虽是穷乡僻壤，倒并不落后，村子上也没有汉奸、特务。可是也就是这种村子常为敌人所痛恨，日本帝国主义也好，国民党反动派也好，对于这种游击区的、或者是边缘区的地方是不客气的，过几天就来敲诈一下，特别是国民党反动派。一九四六年以后，他有两年不敢睡在村子里。
    老罗、小杜都听故事入了神，这一切事对他们都是很新鲜的。他们不知道从前在老区的人们的生活，他们不觉的对于这粮秣主任增加了敬意，静静的听着。
    李洛英已经把他自己碗里的酒喝干了。他的话匣子开了，就像永定河的水似的阻拦不住，他慢悠悠的又叹了一口气：“老丁同志！咱就不愿提起这件事，一九四六年十一月，有一天夜里，天很冷，黑得伸手不见五指。我们山头上的哨，冷得不行，只得来回走走，可是当他再往前走的时候，这时天在慢慢发亮，他猛然看见已经有人摸上村头上的山头了。他赶忙放了一枪就往后山跑，那时咱们都还在睡觉呢，连衣服也顾不上穿好就往外跑。跑得快的就上了山，慢的就跑不出来，敌人已经把村子包围起来了。是还乡团呀！有三百多人。这时有两个区乡干部正好睡在村子上，他们也上了山，可是他们走错了路，走到悬崖上去了。还乡团又追在他们后边。原来是村支书带着他们的，可是天不大亮，跑得急，他们没有跟上来，就这样他们走上了绝路。他们看看后边，敌人已经临近了，前边是陡崖，下边是永定河的水，他们不愿当俘虏就跳下去了，就那样跳崖摔死了，村子里闹得一团糟，还乡团把能吃的都抢走了，咱就从那时候不敢在村子上睡。后来把村子都抢光了，就来一次砸锅，全村的锅、缸、罐、钵都砸光了，咱们硬有十来天没法烧东西吃。……这些事按说也过了许久了，如今咱们谁的生活不过好了？有时也忙的很，想不起这些事，有时也总是朝前边望，娃娃们将来的日子可美咧！可是不知道怎么的，有些事总忘不掉，一想起来心总还是痛。老丁同志！这些该死的反动派，当然也抓到一些，可是总还有逍遥法外的，比如蒋介石这样人，咱恨，就是恨咧……。”
    我不知道说什么好，我也想起了温泉屯的几个村干部，和积极的农民，他们也就是在那年被反动派杀害了。这几个人的影子也就浮上我的脑际，而且更鲜明。
    远处传来一声最大的震响，大约是燃料工业部炸山炸开了一块较大的地方，我们好像又回到现实世界。我走到门口去看，下游修坝的那方，探照灯、水银灯、照得像白天一样，一片雪亮的光。屋后的山路上，电灯也把路照得很明亮。运输车还是不断的驰来驰去。我走回来帮助他们收拾桌子，我同小杜说：“小杜，我们就要像那个碾路的机车，沉沉的压着石头，稳稳的向前走去，我们要永远记住这仇恨，我们用胜利来医治伤痕，你要好好学习，努力工作，听李伯伯的话，他看着你们强，他心就乐了，他就会忘了过去。”
    “李治国学得比我好多了，他得过一次学习模范。”小杜告诉我。
    “李治国是谁呢？”
    “他在泥沙化验室，这工作可要耐心咧，他同我一般大，我们很要好……。”
    老罗不让小杜再说下去，抢着说：“你为什么不说清他是谁。李治国是老李的儿子，是一个很精明的孩子。他在水文站的时间比你长，当然比你强，过一阵你也赶上他了。”
    李洛英脸上忽然开朗了，一层灰暗的愁云赶走了，他甜密的望着我笑。我也说：“你好福气啊！就一个儿子么？”
    “不，还有一个闺女。”
    小杜从抽屉里拿出一张照片，塞给我。这是一个极年青的姑娘，垂着两条小辫，穿一件花衬衫，正是模仿着现在电影上的农村妇女的装饰，很大方的样子。我问老李他闺女是不是也在水库工程局工作。老李告诉我，关于这件事，他们争论了许久，还开过家庭会议。他的意见是留在官厅工作，学做工，做工人，将来还可以找一个工人作“对象”。可是她的娘不赞成，因为官厅村的人都搬到新保安去了，那里盖了一个新村子，替他们家盖了五间新房，又有了几亩好地，老太婆说都工业化去了，地就没有人种啦，要留着闺女在家种地，她还是想找个农民女婿。我问闺女自己的意见呢，一切都应该由她自己做主嘛。老李更笑开了，他说：“她说得倒好，说过几年农村也要工业化的，她不反对工业化，她将来就留在村子上开拖拉机。你听，说得多好听，哼！后来才知道，人家已经自己找下‘对象’了，还不是一个要土圪塔的。”
    小杜便又告诉我，李伯伯的堂兄弟李洛平，和他的侄子李治民都在修配所当工人，他们家还有两个人当水库一修建就参加了工程工作。现在已经离开水库工程局调到别的地方去了。
    老李的神情又变了，说不出的心满意足，但仍保持着他的慢悠悠的神气说道：“官厅村一共有二十多个人转了业，都跟着水库的修建转入了工业。都是年青人，都比我强，他们都不只做工，还学习到技术。咱们李洛平一年就学会掌握了车床，如今已经在带徒弟呢！”
    我想起了我头一天在修配所见到的一切。那里已经只剩五十几个工人了（因为工程快完，有些人又调到别的地方去了）。只有几个是老工人，都是青年，还有两个女民工也在那里学习。李洛平就负责一个女民工的技术学习。李洛平穿着翻皮鞋，蓝布工人装，就像一个中学生来做工，一点也没有农村孩子的土气。我简直没有想到他就是原来官厅村这穷农村的孩子。我一边说我看见过他，同意他们对他的赞许，一边心里惊奇这种变化。时代的脚步跨得太大了，我仿佛听到这种声音，虽然我不是今天才听到的，虽然我时时都合着这音节行走，可是我仍然经常的要为着这紧凑的节奏，激烈的音响而震动。
    天太晚了，我不愿太妨碍他们的工作，我向他们告辞，李洛英不等我说完，就陪着我走出了小屋，而且首先跨进了吉普车。他说他要送我回去，他要到工地去，他说他喜欢在那里走。那明亮、那红火是他做梦也梦不出的地方，他把那里形容成天堂一般。
    我们的车又沿着山，在窄窄的路上往回开。因为是晚上，喇叭就响得更厉害，这时什么声音都听不清了。几处断崖的地方扎着木架子，这种架子只有北京扎天棚的工人才能扎，他们可以悬空高高的扎着，可是非常结实，能载重，人在架上爬上爬下又非常方便。晚上他们也不停工，打着探照灯，人挂在架子上工作着，架子上的影子，图案似的贴在悬崖上，真是多么雄伟的镜头啊！
    车慢慢朝着最热闹的地方，最亮的地方走，已经听到扩音器里放送的音乐，已经听到混凝土搅拌机喀喀喀喀的声音。老头沉不住气了，他在我后面把头俯过来，大声说：“老丁同志！你看呀！这就是咱们的老地方呀！看现在是个什么样子。看人们使多大的劲来改变这地方！”
    车子走到拦洪坝的头前停下了，车子已经不能前进。我的住处在河东，我要经过坝（在现在来说还是工地）走回去，我要从这二百九十公尺长的坝面上走回去。我要穿过几千人，要穿过无数层挑土的、挑沙子的、背石头的、洒水的、打夯的阵线，我要绕过许多碾路车，我要常常找不到路，被迷失在人里边。我每天出来都要通过这个坝，这是一个迷宫，我一走到这里就忘记了一切，就忘记了自己，自己也就变成一撮土，一粒沙那样渺小，就没有了自己了。
    握别了老罗，李洛英和我用同样的心情走到了工地，他紧紧的拉着我，怕人们把我们冲散，但两人在一起对别人的妨碍更大些，所以还是常常得分开。
    年青的小伙子们，在夜的景色中，在电灯繁密得像星辰的夜景中，在强烈的水银灯光下，在千万种喧闹声溶合在一个声音中，显得比白天更有精神。他们迈着大步，跑似的，一行去一行来，穿梭似的运着土、沙……他们跟着扩音器送来的音乐，跟着打夯的吆喝，跟着碾路机的轧轧声跑得更欢了。他们有的穿着买来的翻领衬衫，有的穿着雁北所流行的惹人注意的大红布背心。他们有时同认识的人打招呼，有时鼓励着旁人，和人挑战似的呼喊着。这些人大都是河北各县的农民，可是我觉得他们又同我熟识，又同我不熟识了。他们虽然是在挑土，在推斗车，可是他们脸上浮着活泼的气息，他们并不拘谨，他们灵活，他们常常有一种要求和人打交道的神气，他们热烈，他们并不想掩饰自己的新的欢乐和勇敢。有些人认识老李，又看见老李同我走过，就和老李说话，问我是谁。有个别认识我的，就朝着我笑。我又要看这些人们，又要注意不碰着人，又要注意脚底下，一会儿走在碎石路上，一会儿走在沙子路上，一会儿又踩着湿泥。我们也好像参加了劳动，参加了战斗似的紧张的走过。
    虽说走过来了，我们到了坝的东头，站在溢洪道起点的地方，但这里也还拥挤着人们。李洛英和我抬头四望，在这时我们没有谈话，连眼色也没有交换，但我们彼此很了解。我们在这样场面底下，只有低头。李洛英仍然忍不住冲破了这沉默，他又用那种轻声的调子，慢悠悠的好像是自语似的说道：
    “老丁同志！你知道我们是站在什么地方么？我们的脚底下，就是往日的官厅村，就是我从小住的地方。你看，现在这村子没有了，连一点影子也没有了。你以为我该怎么想？嘿！老丁同志，彻底的把那些贫穷，把那些保守，把那些封建都连根翻了。这里是混凝土，后边是新官厅村，说不上高楼大厦，可是整齐，刷刷新，里边住着建设幸福的人们。你再看，这永定河两面，这是什么世界啊！电灯比星星还多，比水晶还亮，参观的人们说这像上海，像重庆……我没有到过那些地方，也许那里是繁华的，可是这里是些什么人啦？是些什么事？是移山倒海，是些没有自己，一股子劲为了祖国的建设的好汉们。这里有享受吗？劳动就是享受；这里有荣誉吗？劳动就是荣誉；这里有爱吗？劳动就是爱。老丁同志！我从那个世界，旧的世界到了现在，眼看着变，你说我这心里是个什么滋味？”
    我没有看他，也没有说话，我不愿打断他。过了一会，李洛英又说了，他的声音高亢了起来：
  “什么是共产党，我讲不全，因为我没念过什么书，可是我懂得，党就是要人人都有幸福，为了人人的幸福，尽量把自己的东西、把自己的力量拿出来。咱老了，咱现在看水位，仅仅看看水位是不够的，咱还要学习，还要提高，还要帮助人，我要把咱这几根老骨头拿出来，不能让年青的走在头里。我已经看见官厅村变了样，它明年还会好起来，它后年还会更好起来，我在这里，我的家在这里，也会越过越好。可是假如将来有人问起我，你使了什么力量呢？我要答应得上来，我要我心里不难受，觉得我没有吝啬过，我同许多人一样，我不是空着手走过来的。你别看我这样子又干又瘦，这都是过去受的罪，我今年才五十六岁。我心里快活，我还有许多年为人民服务呢。老丁同志！时间不早了，我再送你一段路，你也该休息了。”
    不知为什么，我觉得我太兴奋了。我一点也不想回去，我望得远远地，望到这口子外边，望到远远的濛濛茫茫的一片地方，我想：“是的，旧的官厅村，穷苦的，经过了多年斗争的官厅村没有了，压根儿没有了。这里有的是更广阔的，新的，幸福的世界。湖山变得更美丽，人变得更可爱；粮秣主任艰难的生活过去了，李洛英成为更加有生气的，充实的，懂得生活的水位看管人。……”
    我回头再望他，他是多么亲切的站在我旁边，凝视着坝上的人群，有时又望望我。我最后说：“咱们俩谁也不送谁。过天要有时间我再去你那儿。”
    李洛英同意了我的提议，我们分手了。我却没有走，我望着他的后影，他被人群遮住了，可是又看见了，我好像永远看见他精灵瘦削的身子在人群中隐现，他用他那微微闪烁的，带着一些潮湿的眼睛，抚摸着很多人。
    什么时候我回到了自己的住处，我不知道。
