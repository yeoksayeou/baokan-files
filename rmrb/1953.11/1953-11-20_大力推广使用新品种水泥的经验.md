    Experiences in Vigorously Promoting the Use of New Types of Cement
    Chen Changxiong
    Using multiple varieties and grades of cement is a major advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Adopting this method can greatly increase cement production, and also improve the performance of silicate cement (such as increasing water resistance, erosion resistance, heat resistance, improving workability, and reducing heat of hydration, etc.). Judging from the preliminary balance of China's Five-Year Plan, cement production is far from meeting the growing needs of construction. To meet the needs of construction, the state will increase the construction of cement plants. However, building a new cement plant takes two to three years from planning the site to starting production, and the construction investment for one plant requires several hundred billion yuan. Therefore, it is very necessary and urgent to promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    In the past two years, the production of multi-variety and multi-grade cement mixed with admixture in some areas of China has increased production by 25 percent, which is equivalent to building three new large-scale cement plants. At the same time, it also saved 10 percent of production costs (the funds saved from cost reductions can be used to build about 100,000 square meters of workers' dormitories). In the past two years, the multi-variety and multi-grade cement produced in China has been widely used in various types of projects. Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) adopted slag cement for equipment foundations requiring heat resistance, shale cement for foundations requiring erosion resistance, and more than 10,000 tons of loess cement were used in the large-volume equipment foundation project of the automated seamless steel pipe plant; in important water conservancy constructions, such as the Guanting Reservoir, a large amount of water-resistant slag cement was used; the scope of use in general housing construction is even more extensive. Facts have proved that it is not only beneficial but also possible to produce and use multi-variety and multi-grade cement in China.
    However, in the two years of promotion work, resistance from conservative thinking has been commonly encountered. When starting to promote and use multi-variety and multi-grade cement, many units applying for materials from the materials distribution agencies, or construction personnel receiving materials at construction sites, regardless of the nature of the project and construction conditions, rushed to demand high-grade ordinary cement, and only reluctantly used lower-grade cement mixed with admixture. When defects occurred in the quality of projects using cement mixed with admixture, some people did not humbly examine the shortcomings of construction operations, nor did they study the characteristics of the cement and take measures to ensure project quality based on these characteristics, but instead blamed the cement mixed with admixture. They regarded cement mixed with admixture as inferior cement, discarding 200-grade cement or using it as whitewash on walls, seriously wasting state resources. On the other hand, because this advanced experience has not been promoted for long, many cadres and engineering technicians lack theoretical knowledge and practical experience in this area, and have not actively learned from the Soviet Union. Therefore, some places have failed to exert its superior effect in using cement mixed with admixture, and have even caused many shortcomings. For example, it is not allowed to use 200-grade cement for cement floors in the Soviet Union, but some units misused it, resulting in sanding of the floor, causing rework and waste. Also, some cements mixed with admixture (such as slag cement) have greater drying shrinkage and lower early strength. The Soviet experience is to strengthen maintenance work, but some units did not pay attention to this, resulting in insufficient strength and a large number of cracks in some projects. Experience has shown that to promote and widely use cement mixed with admixture, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of promotion work, conduct extensive publicity, and break down conservative thinking; at the same time, practical experience must be summarized and promoted, and the use of technology must be improved.
    Through two years of implementation, some units have done well and gained some experience. For example, when the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau used cement mixed with admixture on some construction sites, it attached importance to publicity and education. They used the method of detailed accounting to repeatedly explain the important significance of this advanced experience to cadres and workers, which not only ensured project quality, but also improved work efficiency. In places where publicity work is well done, workers no longer call slag cement "bad cement," but say: "As long as slag cement is used well, it is the same as ordinary cement, and there is absolutely no problem with quality." According to comrades in charge of construction at Angang: Having the three conditions of mechanical mixing, a laboratory to implement the inspection system, and the implementation of operating procedures can achieve the expected concrete grade. They studied and mastered the characteristics of admixtures, formulated operating procedures and implemented them among the workers, and also used the characteristic of slower setting of cement mixed with admixture to solve the problem of summer construction, giving full play to the superiority of cement mixed with admixture. These achievements and experiences have created favorable conditions for promoting and widely using cement mixed with admixture.
    The "Experience Promotion Conference on the Use of Multi-Variety and Multi-Grade Cement," jointly convened by the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Construction Engineering, opened in Beijing on the 18th of this month. This conference is to promote the great significance of using multi-variety and multi-grade cement for national construction and increasing production and practicing economy to responsible cadres, engineering technicians, advanced workers, and comrades from academic research departments from all over the country, exchange experiences in promotion and use in the past two years, so as to quickly promote it nationwide. We wish the conference a success.

    大力推广使用新品种水泥的经验
    陈长熊
    使用多品种、多标号水泥是苏联一项重大的先进经验。采用这种办法，可以大大增加水泥产量，同时可改善矽酸盐水泥的性能（如增加了抗水性、耐侵蚀性、耐热性及和易性，并减低了水化热等）。从我国五年计划的初步平衡来看，水泥产量尚远不能满足日益增长的建设的需要。为了满足建设的需要，国家是要增建水泥厂的。但是新建一个水泥厂，从规划厂址直到开工生产总需两三年的时间，而且一个厂的建设投资就需数千亿元。因此，推广苏联这一先进经验是非常必要和十分迫切的。
    两年来，我国在部分地区生产掺有混合材料的多品种、多标号的水泥，就增加了百分之二十五的产量，其效果相当于新建三个大型水泥厂；同时还节约生产成本百分之十（用节约成本的资金约可修建十万平方公尺面积的工人宿舍）。两年来我国所生产的多品种、多标号水泥，已大量地使用在各种不同性质的工程上，鞍钢在需要耐热的设备基础上采用了矿渣水泥，在需要耐侵蚀的基础上采用了页岩水泥，自动化无缝钢管厂的大体积设备基础工程中使用垆坶水泥达万余吨之多；在重要的水利建设上，如官厅水库，则采用了大量的抗水性的矿渣水泥；一般房屋建筑中使用范围更加广泛。事实证明，在我国生产与使用多品种、多标号的水泥，不但有益而且是可能的。
    但是，在两年来的推广工作中，普遍地遇到了保守思想的抵抗。开始推广与使用多品种、多标号水泥的时候，许多单位向物资分配机关请领材料，或是施工人员在工地领取材料，都不分工程性质和施工条件，争先恐后地要高标号的普通水泥，迫不得已才领用较低标号的掺有混合材料的水泥。有些人在使用掺有混合材料的水泥的工程质量上发生缺点时，不是虚心地检查施工操作的缺点，不去钻研水泥特性，并针对这些特性采取措施以保证工程质量，而是一味地归罪于掺有混合材料的水泥。他们把掺有混合材料的水泥视为品质低劣的水泥，把二○○号的水泥弃置不用，或当作白灰抹墙，严重地浪费了国家的物资。另一方面，由于这一先进经验推广不久，许多干部和工程技术人员还缺乏这方面的理论知识和实践经验，同时又没有积极地向苏联学习，因此有些地方在使用掺有混合材料的水泥中未能发挥其优越的效果，甚至造成了很多的缺点。如用二○○号水泥抹水泥地面在苏联是不允许的，可是有的单位却错用了，以致地面起砂，造成返工浪费。又如某些掺有混合材料的水泥
  （如矿渣水泥）干缩性较大，早期强度较低，苏联的经验是要加强养护工作，可是有的单位没有注意这点，以致有些工程发生了强度不足及大量裂缝的现象。经验证明，要推广和大量使用?有混合材料的水泥，必须加强推广工作的领导，广泛进行宣传，打破保守思想；同时还要把实践经验加以总结和推广，在使用技术上提高一步。
    经过两年来的推行结果，有些单位做得较好，并取得了一些经验。如北京市建筑工程局在一些工地上使用掺有混合材料的水泥时，重视了宣传教育工作。他们用算细账的办法反复向干部和工人说明了这一先进经验的重要意义，结果不但保证了工程质量，而且还提高了工作效率。在宣传工作做得好的地方，工人们不再把矿渣水泥叫作“坏水泥”了，而是说：“矿渣水泥只要用得好，和普通水泥一样，质量绝无问题。”据鞍钢负责施工的同志表示：在具备了机械搅拌、有试验室执行检验制度，和执行操作规程这三个条件，可以达到预期的混凝土标号。他们研究和掌握了掺有混合材料的特性，订出了操作规程并贯彻到工人中去，还利用了掺有混合材料水泥凝固较慢的特性，解决了夏季施工问题，充分发挥了掺有混合材料水泥的优越性。这些成绩和经验，就为推广和大量使用掺有混合材料的水泥，创造了有利的条件。
    由中央重工业部和建筑工程部共同召开的“使用多品种、多标号水泥经验推广大会”于本月十八日在北京开幕了。这个大会就是向来自全国各地有关建筑部门的负责干部、工程技术人员、先进工人以及学术研究部门的同志，宣传使用多品种多标号水泥对国家建设及增产节约的重大意义，交流两年来推行与使用中的经验，以便在全国范围内迅速推广。我们预祝大会的成功。
