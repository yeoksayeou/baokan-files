    Suzhou Grain Company Outlet Repeatedly Issues Incorrect Pickup Vouchers
    Reader Lu Dezhang writes: Once, the Jiangsu Province Suzhou Municipal Government Canteen went to the Suzhou Municipal Company Outlet of the China Grain Company (hereinafter referred to as the Outlet) to purchase 5,000 jin of rice. The comrades at the Outlet filled out a pickup voucher and told them to pick up the goods at the Suzhou Municipal Cooperative Headquarters. When the comrades from the Municipal Government Canteen arrived at the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, they discovered that the rice there had already been completely picked up and they had to return to the Outlet to make contact. The comrades at the Outlet then changed the voucher to allow them to pick up the rice at the Mingji Rice Mill. From March to September, the Outlet repeatedly issued these incorrect pickup vouchers, causing customers to make fruitless trips back and forth. The "Reader's Letters" column of the New Suzhou Daily had published three reader letters criticizing this practice of the Outlet; relevant comrades from the Outlet had also made two public self-criticisms in the same newspaper. However, this kind of thing has still not disappeared.
    Is it that the system is not sound, preventing the comrades at the Outlet from grasping the actual quantity of inventory, leading to this kind of thing happening repeatedly? No. Each processing factory affiliated with the company reports the inventory figures to the company's processing section every night at a set time. The processing section then prepares an inventory daily report and sends it to the business section that evening. The next morning, the Outlet sells goods and issues pickup vouchers based on the inventory daily report. However, some comrades at the Outlet do not follow the inventory daily report and issue pickup vouchers arbitrarily, causing customers to sometimes waste time and not be able to pick up the goods.
    I believe that the China Grain Company Suzhou Municipal Company must strengthen education for the comrades at the Outlet to correct this bad phenomenon.

### 苏州市粮食公司门市部屡次乱开提货凭证

专栏：读者来信摘要

    苏州市粮食公司门市部屡次乱开提货凭证
    读者鲁德章来信：有一次，江苏省苏州市机关食堂到中国粮食公司苏州市公司门市部（以下简称门市部）去购买五千斤米，门市部同志给填了提货凭证叫到苏州市合作总社去提货。机关食堂的同志到市合作总社后，发现那里的米已经提清了，只得回到门市部联系。门市部同志才给改到明记米厂去提。从三月到九月，门市部连续发生这种乱开提货凭证，使顾客徒劳往返的事情。新苏州报的“读者来信”栏里曾刊登过三次读者来信，批评门市部这种作风；门市部有关同志也曾在该报上作过两次公开的检讨。但是，这种事情依然没有绝迹。
    是不是由于制度不健全使门市部同志不能掌握库存实际数量，以致屡次发生这种事情呢？不是的。公司所属各加工厂，每晚定时向公司的加工科报告库存数字，加工科随即制成库存日报表于当晚送往业务科。次日早上，门市部就根据库存日报表售货和开提货凭证。但是，门市部有的同志却不根据库存日报表，随便开提货凭证，使顾客有时浪费了时间，提不到货。
    我认为，中国粮食公司苏州市公司必须对门市部同志加强教育，纠正这种不良现象。
