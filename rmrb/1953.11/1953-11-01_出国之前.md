　　Before Going Abroad
    Ding Li
    September 26th. People were having dinner when a notice was sent from the county to Sun Wenhai's home in Yuqing Village.
    Sun Wenhai is the director and Party branch secretary of the Yuqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linkou County, Songjiang Province. When he saw the notice, he was overjoyed and immediately decided to hold an emergency meeting of the cooperative's Party members after dinner.
    "Director Sun, go with peace of mind!"
    In the cooperative's accounting office, two rectangular tables were placed side by side, surrounded by more than ten people. Sun Wenhai glanced from left to right, thirteen people, all present.
    Sun Wenhai stood up, gently moved his stool, and said with a smile: "Although we just had a branch meeting four or five days ago, there is an important matter today that I want to discuss with everyone. ..." The first sentence surprised everyone. Li Shuzhi tilted his head, and Yang Degui tightly closed his mouth, desperately swallowing a mouthful of smoke he had just inhaled, as if afraid that the smoke would escape and hinder his hearing. Sun Wenhai continued: "Because I am going to participate in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to慰问 (offer sympathy and solicitude) to Korea!"
    "What? Go to Korea?" Yang Degui and Liu Wanchun both asked, as if they had misheard.
    "That's right, go to Korea. I'm leaving the day after tomorrow!" Sun Wenhai nodded, with a smile on his face again.
    "Oh, that's great!" Yang Degui couldn't help but clap his hands. Soon, applause rang out. Everyone spoke at once, and the room became lively, almost impossible to tell who was speaking.
    "Don't make noise, listen to Director Sun!" Deputy Director Wang Dehai banged on the table with his hand. Immediately, there was silence again.
    "After I leave, Comrade Wang Dehai will be responsible for the cooperative. I hope everyone will work together to improve production and practice economy and increase production. The things of the past, I guarantee to tell the Volunteers!..." Before Sun Wenhai finished speaking, applause rang out again in the room. Wang Dehai stood up in the applause and said on behalf of everyone: "Director Sun, go with peace of mind! We will definitely do as you say. When you see our Volunteers, tell them: we have grain when you need grain and people when you need people!"
    Entrustment
    The news that Sun Wenhai was going to Korea spread throughout the village like a gust of wind. The next day, as soon as Sun Wenhai got up, his room was crowded with people. Old Zhai, a military dependent, never liked to visit, but he also came today. Ren Huaizhi, as if afraid that Sun Wenhai would forget his words, held his hand and repeatedly instructed: "Be sure not to forget to tell the Volunteers that in the two or three years since they went abroad, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have established cooperatives, used horse-drawn farm implements, and harvested more grain, and our lives are as red as fire!" Geng Haijun took over: "Also tell the Volunteers, whatever they use, we have, we must be worthy of them!"
    Military dependent Old Zhai patted Sun Wenhai on the shoulder and instructed him again and again: "If you see my Xiao Wuzi (referring to his fifth son, Zhai Changlin), tell him: everything is fine at home, tell him to work hard at the front, and don't worry about home!" Here, he suddenly stopped, blinked a few times, and then said: "Also, also, tell him not to be careless and to guard against the enemy's new tricks!"
    Sun Wenhai kept all the entrustments and feelings of everyone in his heart. He said to everyone: "Don't worry, I won't forget a word of what the villagers said, and I will report it to the Volunteers in detail."
    Farewell
    At night, the children were all asleep. Sun Wenhai, who was deep in thought, suddenly jumped off the kang and took a box from the top of the cabinet, rummaging through it constantly. He took out all the materials since the establishment of the cooperative and flipped through them page by page. A woman was busy packing his luggage under the light. She is Sun Wenhai's wife, Guan Mingzhen.
    "You're leaving tomorrow, go to bed early!" Guan Mingzhen looked at the clock, it was already eleven o'clock.
    "Okay!" Sun Wenhai replied casually, still rummaging through the pile of materials. After reading for a while, he drew a circle on it with a pencil with a bald tip.
    It seemed that Guan Mingzhen was a little impatient, but she still said kindly: "It's almost midnight, you can do anything tomorrow morning! Look, your eyes are red from staying up!"
    Sun Wenhai wiped his eyes with his hand and said, "The Volunteers are very concerned about our production. If we don't prepare enough materials, what will we say when we see the Volunteers!"
    Just as the sky was beginning to dawn, Guan Mingzhen had prepared breakfast.
    Xiao Fuchen also woke up especially early that day. Seeing his father eating, he already knew that his father was going to Korea, and asked: "Dad is going to Korea, when will he come back?"
    "Two or three months!"
    "When Dad comes back, he must buy me two notebooks!" Xiao Fuchen said, reaching out his two small hands into Sun Wenhai's arms.
    "Okay, you have to study hard at home, don't fight, don't make Mom angry. Otherwise, I won't give you the notebooks even if I buy them back!"
    Wang Dehai and two other cooperative members rushed to his home to see him off. Sun Wenhai was afraid of delaying everyone's production, so he and these people went through the small road behind the cooperative's house. Who knew that as soon as they turned past the front of the house, it was already crowded with people seeing them off. When Sun Wenhai and the others arrived, everyone rushed up together, shaking hands and giving instructions. Sun Wenhai didn't know who to talk to. In the noisy voices, there was one sentence he heard very clearly: "See you when you come back, don't forget to send our regards to the Volunteers!"

　　出国之前
    丁力
    九月二十六日。人们正在吃晚饭，一个通知，从县里送到了余庆屯孙文海的家里。
    孙文海是松江省林口县余庆农业生产合作社的主任，又是党支部书记，他一看通知，真是喜出望外，马上决定晚饭后就召集社里的党员开个紧急会议。
    “孙主任，你放心去吧！”
    在合作社的会计办公室里，并摆着两张长方桌子，周围坐着十多个人。孙文海从左往右扫了一眼，十三个人，全都到齐了。
    孙文海站起来，轻轻地挪了一下凳子，笑着说：“虽说头四五天刚开了支部会，可是今天有一件重要事情，要和大伙商量一下。……”第一句话，就使得大家感到惊奇，李树枝把脑袋侧楞了一下，杨德贵紧紧地闭着嘴，拼命地把刚吸到嘴里的一口烟往肚子里咽，好像怕烟跑出来，会阻碍他的听觉似的。孙文海继续着：“因为我要参加中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，到朝鲜去！”
    “怎么？到朝鲜去？”杨德贵，刘万春都好像听错了话似地，追问了一句。
    “对啦，到朝鲜去。后天就要走了！”孙文海点着头，脸上又露出了笑容。
    “嗳呀，那可太好了！”杨德贵不由得拍起巴掌来。随着，掌声都响了起来。你一句，我一句，屋子里马上热闹起来，几乎听不出来是谁的声音。
    “不要吵啦，听孙主任说下去！”副主任王德海，用手狠狠地敲打着桌面。立刻，又是一片寂静。
    “我走了以后，社内由王德海同志负责。希望大伙共同努力，搞好生产，搞好增产节约。过去的事儿，我保证都告诉给志愿军！……”孙文海的话还没说完，屋里又响起了掌声。王德海在掌声中站了起来，代表大伙说：“孙主任，你放心去吧！我们一定照着你的话去做。你见了咱们志愿军，就说：要粮有粮，要人有人！”
    委托
    孙文海要到朝鲜去的消息，就好像一阵风，很快就传遍了全屯。第二天，孙文海刚起床，他的屋子里就挤满了人。老翟头，是志愿军军属，从来都不爱串门，可是今天也来了。任怀志好像怕孙文海会忘记了自己的话似地，拉着他的手再三嘱托：“千万可别忘了告诉志愿军，说在他们出国的两三年里，咱们在毛主席领导下，成立了合作社，使用了马拉农具，粮食也打得多了，日子像火炭一样的红！”耿海君接过来：“还要告诉志愿军，他们用啥，咱有啥，一定对得起他们！”
    军属老翟头拍打着孙文海的肩膀，一遍又一遍地嘱托：“你要是看到了我的小五子（指他的第五个儿子翟长林），告诉他：家里一切都好，叫他在前方好好干，千万不要记挂家中！”这里，他突然停住了，眨了几下眼，又说：“还有，还有，叫他不要含糊，防备着敌人的新花招！”
    所有人的嘱托，所有人的心情，孙文海都记在自己的心里。他对大家说：“请放心吧，乡亲们的话，我一句也忘不了，保管要一五一十报告给志愿军。”
    送别
    夜，孩子们都入睡了。正在沉思的孙文海突然跳下炕来，从柜子上面取下来一个箱子，不停地翻腾着。他把合作社成立以来的材料全都找出来，一页一页地翻着。一个女人，在灯光下忙着给他整理行装。她，是孙文海的爱人关明珍。
    “明天还要走哪，早点睡吧！”关明珍看了一下钟，已经十一点了。
    “喔！”孙文海随口答应了一声，仍然翻腾着那一堆材料。看一阵子，便用一支秃了头的铅笔，在上边划个圈。
    看样子，关明珍有点不耐烦了，但仍很亲切地说：“快半夜啦，有啥事明早再办呗！看，你那双眼睛都熬红了！”
    孙文海用手擦了一下眼，说：“志愿军很关心我们的生产，要不把材料准备得多多的，见了志愿军说啥呀！”
    天刚蒙蒙亮，关明珍就把早饭准备好了。
    小福臣这天也醒得特别早，看到他爸爸吃饭，他已知道他爸爸就要上朝鲜去了，问道：“爸上朝鲜，多咋回来呀？”
    “两三个月吧！”
    “爸回来了，可得给我买两个小本子啊！”小福臣说着，把两只小手伸向了孙文海的怀里。
    “好吧，你在家可得好好念书，别打架，别惹妈生气。要不，买回本本来也不给你！”
    王德海和另外两个社员早赶到他家来送行。孙文海怕耽误大家的生产，就和这几个人从合作社的房后穿小路过去了。谁知道，刚拐过去房头，那里早已挤满了欢送的人群。等孙文海他们到时，大家一齐拥了上去，握手的握手，嘱托的嘱托。弄得孙文海也不知给谁说话好。在吵杂的声音中，有一句话他听得很清楚：“回来再见吧，可不要忘了代我们向志愿军问好！”
