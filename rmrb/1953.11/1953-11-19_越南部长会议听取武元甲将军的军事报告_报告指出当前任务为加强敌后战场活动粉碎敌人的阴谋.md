Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 16th, the Vietnamese Council of Ministers held a plenary meeting at the end of October under the chairmanship of President Ho Chi Minh.

After reviewing the domestic and international situation of the past few months, the meeting listened to the military report of General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army.

In his report, General Vo Nguyen Giap said that since the victory of the Northwest Campaign last autumn and winter, guerrilla warfare has become increasingly fierce in the enemy's rear.

In order to stabilize their rear, the enemy launched several large-scale "sweeps" in the Red River Delta region of North Vietnam. The Vietnamese People's Army retaliated against them and annihilated a large number of the enemy's active forces. In the second half of October, the French colonial army invaded the liberated areas of the Third War Zone (Ru Guan Prefecture), and boasted that they had "regained the military initiative," but these basically passive military operations of the enemy have been defeated.

General Vo Nguyen Giap finally pointed out that as the enemy becomes increasingly defeated, they will more frantically realize their conspiracies of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese." Our current task is to strengthen activities on all battlefields in the enemy's rear in order to crush the enemy's conspiracy.

The Council of Ministers also discussed other issues. The meeting approved the "Plan for Consolidating Local People's Power in Villages Where Mass Mobilization Has Been Completed" and made some amendments to certain provisions of the Agricultural Tax Regulations to reduce the burden on the people in the enemy's rear and mountainous areas.

    越南部长会议听取武元甲将军的军事报告
    报告指出当前任务为加强敌后战场活动粉碎敌人的阴谋
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十六日讯：越南部长会议十月底在胡志明主席主持下举行了全体会议。
    会议在回顾几个月来的国内外形势以后，听取了越南人民军总司令武元甲将军的军事报告。
    武元甲将军在他的报告中说，从去年秋冬西北战役胜利结束以来，游击战在敌人后方已越来越剧烈。
    敌人为了稳定他们的后方，曾在北越红河三角洲地区发动了几次大规模的“扫荡”。越南人民军对他们进行了回击，歼灭敌人的大批有生力量。十月下半月，法国殖民军曾向第三战区的解放区（儒关府）进犯，并吹嘘他们已“重新取得了军事主动权”，但是敌人的这些基本上是被动的军事行动都已遭到了失败。
    武元甲将军最后指出：敌人在越来越失败的情况下，会更加疯狂地来实现他们的“以战养战”和“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋。我们目前的任务，是要在敌人后方的各个战场上加强活动，以粉碎敌人的阴谋。
    部长会议并讨论了其他问题。会议批准了“在发动群众运动已经完成了的村庄中巩固当地人民政权的计划”，并对农业税条例的某些条款做了修正，以减轻敌后和山区人民的负担。
