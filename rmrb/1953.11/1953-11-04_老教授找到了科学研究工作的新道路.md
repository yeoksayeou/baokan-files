    Old Professor Finds New Path for Scientific Research
    He Qingnian, Teaching Assistant of Anatomy, Beijing Medical College

    In a bright room in the East Building of Beijing Medical College, every morning, as soon as the janitor finishes cleaning, you can see a kind old man sitting peacefully by the microscope, beginning his day's work. At this time, the corridor is quiet, and the students are waiting for the first class bell. Whether in the heat of summer or the cold of winter, rain or shine, we often see this scene. This old man is Professor Ma Wenzhao of the Anatomy Department, and he is already sixty-eight years old this year.

    Before liberation, Professor Ma Wenzhao experienced various difficulties and faced dark resistance in his scientific research. In 1935, as a result of his diligent work, he discovered a "micro-substance" with varying degrees of staining between the connective tissue fibers of the capsule of the white mouse lymph nodes. Careful observation could identify that this "micro-substance" formed the nuclei of undifferentiated reticular cells, which produced various types of cells in the lymph nodes. Although this was an accidental discovery in his research, this fact completely contradicted Virchow's idealistic dogma of "cells can only arise from cells," which hindered the development of biology. Therefore, his discovery was not only not valued at the time but was also ridiculed; his paper was also suppressed, and when it was finally published, much of this part was deleted. A scientific worker undoubtedly cherishes the fruits of his labor. Mentioning this matter, Professor Ma Wenzhao still feels the pain. He once said with emotion, "These are all things of the past."

    The darkness has passed, and the sun has risen in the East. Not long after the liberation of Beijing, he wrote to the health leadership department, seeking their opinion on his research work. Responsible comrades from the health leadership department not only came to see him in person and asked if he had any difficulties in his work but also provided material support. This made him deeply appreciate the care and concern of the motherland and the people for him. From then on, while undertaking busy teaching work, he continued to carry out scientific research.

    Later, the People's Daily reported on the great achievements of the Soviet biologist Academician Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya in biology: from a series of experiments, it was completely confirmed that cells can evolve from the living substance of acellular structures (i.e., living matter). This fundamentally overthrew Virchow's dogma and opened up a broad path for the development of biology. After seeing this news, he was extremely excited, believing that this was a major new achievement in biology. He firmly believed that the new social system could provide the best conditions for the development of science and put forward urgent requirements for scientific research workers. At the beginning of this year, the leadership transferred two of his students to work as his assistants. When they started working, he said to them, "In the future, you must be meticulous in your work; otherwise, you will be irresponsible to the Party and the people." These two sentences fully demonstrated his sense of responsibility and his expectations for the new generation. He also earnestly taught them, "There is absolutely no room for opportunism in science. We have only one guiding principle: to serve the interests of the people. I do my work based on this, and I hope you will always think about this. Be practical, serious, modest, and responsible in your work. Absolutely do not be careless. Any small carelessness in scientific research will lead to errors in our conclusions." He fulfills this in practice. If his students do not do well in a step or an operation in the research, he will ask you to repeat it once or twice, and he never shows any impatience. He often said to his students, "In the old society, I learned by groping alone. It took me six or seven years to master the basic knowledge. I believe that you will definitely not need that much time. Now, in addition to doing my research work well, I want you to learn well." He clearly knows that the need for talent in national construction is urgent. He often said to his assistants, "Don't just think about my work, but also think about your studies. This is also important." He does not let them be fixed on one job but constantly comes up with new topics for them to study. He said, "You must learn from all aspects, lay a good foundation, and then improve." In this way, as his students and assistants, these two young people feel infinitely close, and in getting along with Professor Ma Wenzhao, they are as close as family members.

    If he is so strict with the younger generation, what about himself? In learning, especially in learning from the Soviet Union, he is equally courageous. Last winter vacation, when Beijing Medical College organized teachers to conduct intensive Russian language learning, he happily participated. In this difficult and intense learning process, he maintained a full learning enthusiasm from beginning to end. After that, with the help of the counselors, he still reads articles and memorizes vocabulary, and at the same time, he encourages others to master the ability of Russian reading. He can carefully read Lepeshinskaya's writings and apply her new views and methods in his research work. He said, "In the past, we often could not explain many phenomena we observed. Today, we have the opportunity to understand them more deeply. We must study Lepeshinskaya's theory more and test it from practice to further supplement it." This attitude of humbly learning from the Soviet Union has brought new strength to his research work. Recently, Professor Ma Wenzhao and Academician Lepeshinskaya have also established contact and exchanged research results. Academician Lepeshinskaya said in a letter, "First of all, please allow me to express my deep gratitude for your letter. You have given a certain evaluation of my research work. Your work completely confirms and develops my cause in this regard. What makes me very happy is that you and I, with our work achievements, refuted Virchow's pseudo-science." This enthusiastic letter from Lepeshinskaya encouraged him even more. In his research on how to enhance the function of macrophages in animals, that is, to enhance the resistance to harmful substances invading the body, based on Lepeshinskaya's theory and his own observed facts, he put forward a new explanation for the process of local production of macrophages. Recently, he also used the basic viewpoints put forward in Lepeshinskaya's theory to examine the problem of cell regeneration in the process of animal wound healing. This is of certain significance in theory and practice.

    Marx once said: "There is no smooth road to science, and only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path have the hope of reaching the glorious peak." Professor Ma Wenzhao is practicing this famous saying with his working spirit of "decades as a day" and his attitude of learning from the Soviet Union with renewed efforts.

    老教授找到了科学研究工作的新道路
    北京医学院解剖学科助教　何庆年
    在北京医学院东楼一间敞亮的房子里，每天早晨工友刚把屋子打扫好，就可以看见一位和善的老人安详地坐在显微镜旁，开始他一天的工作。这时候，走廊里是安静的，同学们正在等待着第一节的上课铃声。不问暑伏或寒天，也不管刮风下雨，我们经常可以看到这种情况。这位老人就是解剖学科的马文昭教授，他今年已经六十八岁了。
    解放前，马文昭教授在科学研究工作中曾经历过种种的困难，也曾遇到过黑暗的阻力。一九三五年，他由于辛勤工作的结果，发见白鼠淋巴结被膜的结缔组织纤维之间，有一种染色由浅到深的“微质”，细心观察，可以鉴定这种“微质”形成未分化网状细胞的核，这种网状细胞产生淋巴结中各型的细胞。虽然这是他研究工作中的一个偶然的发见，但这个事实却是与阻碍着生物学发展的微尔和唯心论“细胞只能产生自细胞”的说教完全抵触的。因此，他的这一发见在当时不但不被重视，竟然受到奚落；他的论文也被扣压下来，最后发表时，这一部分多被删节。一个科学工作者对自己的劳动成果无疑是珍惜的，提起这件事情，马文昭教授犹有余痛，他曾感慨地说：“这些都是过去的事。”
    黑暗过去了，太阳升起在东方。北京解放不久，他曾写信给卫生领导部门，征询对他研究工作的意见。卫生领导部门的负责同志除了亲自来看他，问他工作中有没有困难，并且在物质上给予支援。这就使他深深体会到祖国和人民对他的关切。从此，他一边担任着繁忙的教学工作，一边继续进行着科学研究工作。
    后来，人民日报报道了苏联伟大生物学家奥·勃·勒伯辛斯卡娅院士在生物学上的巨大成就：从一系列的实验中完全证实了，细胞可以由无细胞结构的生活物质（即活质）演变而来。这就根本推翻了微尔和的说教，为生物学的发展开辟了广阔的道路。他看到这个消息以后，心里兴奋异常，认为这是生物学上的一个重大的新成就。他深信：新的社会制度才能为科学提供最好的发展条件，并向科学研究工作者提出迫切的要求。今年年初，领导方面调他的两个学生来专门作他的助手。开始工作时，他就对他们说：“以后，你们在工作中要作到分毫不苟；否则，就是对党、对人民不负责任。”这两句话充分表现了他的责任感和对新一代的期望。他又谆谆教育他们：“在科学上绝对没有可以投机取巧之处。我们行动的准则只有一个：为人民的利益服务。我的工作是本着这一条来作的，希望你们也时时刻刻想着这一点。对工作要踏实、认真、虚心、负责，绝对不能草率从事，科学研究工作里边任何一个小的马虎，都会使我们的结论发生错误。”他在实践里边履行着这一点，要是他的学生在研究中有一个步骤、一个操作没有作好，他就叫你重复一遍、两遍，他从来也不曾表示不耐烦。他又常常对他的学生说：“在旧社会里我是独自摸索着学的。为了掌握基本的知识，我足足花了六、七年的时光。我相信，你们是绝对用不了这么多时间的。现在，我除了作好研究工作之外，就是让你们学好。”他清楚地知道，在国家建设中，对于人材的需要是刻不容缓的。他经常对他的助手说：“不要只想到我的工作，同时要想着你们的学习，这也是重要的。”他不让他们固定在一件工作上，不断拟出新的题目让他们进行研究。他说：“你们要从各方面学习，打好基础，然后再提高。”这样，作为他的学生和助手，这两个年青人感到无限的亲切，在和马文昭教授相处中亲如家人。
    对于年青一代的要求如此严格，那末，他对自己呢？在学习上，首先是在学习苏联上，同样是勇往直前的。去年寒假，北京医学院组织教师进行俄文速成学习时，他愉快地参加了。在这一艰难而紧张的学习中，他自始至终保持着饱满的学习情绪。此后，在辅导员的帮助之下，他仍然读文章，记单字，同时他又鼓励别人掌握俄文阅读的本领。他能细心地阅读勒伯辛斯卡娅的著述，并在研究工作中运用她的新的观点和方法。他说：“以前，我们对自己观察到的许多现象往往不能加以解释，今天我们才有可能更深刻地理解它。对于勒伯辛斯卡娅的学说，要更多地进行研究，从实践里边来检验它，进一步补充它。”这种虚心向苏联学习的态度，给他的研究工作带来了新的力量。最近，马文昭教授和勒伯辛斯卡娅院士又建立了联系，互相交换研究成果。勒伯辛斯卡娅院士在一次来信中说：“首先，请允许我对您的来信致以深厚的谢意，您对我的研究工作给予了一定的评价。你的工作完全证实着和发展着我在这方面所从事的事业。使我非常高兴的，是您同我一起以自己的工作成绩反驳了微尔和的伪科学。”勒伯辛斯卡娅这封热情洋溢的信，更加鼓舞了他。在他研究如何增强动物体内巨噬细胞的功能，即增强对侵入体内有害物质的抵抗作用时，依据勒伯辛斯卡娅的学说和他自己所观察到的事实，对巨噬细胞在局部产生的过程，提出了新的解释。最近他又依据勒伯辛斯卡娅学说中所提出的基本观点，来检查动物创伤愈合过程中细胞新生的问题。这在理论和实用上，都是有一定的意义的。
    马克思曾经说过：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”马文昭教授正是以“数十年如一日”的工作精神，以他再接再厉向苏联学习的态度来实践着这一句名言的。
