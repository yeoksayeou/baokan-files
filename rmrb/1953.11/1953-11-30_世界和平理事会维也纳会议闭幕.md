Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 28th: The World Peace Council Vienna Meeting closed on the 28th. The meeting adopted a general resolution calling on the people of all countries to strengthen the struggle for world peace; and adopted the World Peace Council's letter to organizations and individuals hoping to ease international tensions, the letter from scientists attending the World Peace Council Vienna Meeting to scientists of all countries, and resolutions on promoting cultural relations between the peoples of all countries. According to the suggestion of World Peace Council Secretary-General Rafael, the meeting unanimously approved the list of new members of the World Peace Council and new members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

At the closing meeting, Egyptian representative Abdulla Rahman al-Sharqawi spoke, followed by former German Chancellor Joseph Wirth. He said, "We learned with great joy and satisfaction of the recent note from the Soviet Union expressing the Soviet government's willingness to participate in a Four-Power Conference. The Soviet initiative makes the convening of the Four-Power Conference possible, which will help to spare the German people from the threat of West Germany becoming a military base." Wirth pointed out: "This idea of seeking peace and understanding with all countries and all neighbors must be taken as a principle of German foreign policy." He said: "There are powerful forces in West Germany opposing revenge and militarist policies. Our task is to unite its still dispersed forces into a single, united opposition force, making them a decisive political factor."

Wirth said that the struggle waged by the German Democratic Republic is gaining the trust of all peace-loving people and the people of all countries. In a peaceful, reunified Germany, policy must be formulated by democratic forces. This would ensure that we can provide security to our neighbors and will be our contribution to the great cause of European and world peace.

Next, Sahib Singh Sokhey of India spoke. He said, "I have no doubt that the method of sincere negotiations will eventually prevail. Some countries do not want a peaceful solution to the Korean question and other international disputes. Various difficulties will continue to arise in resolving the Korean question, but we must prevent the recurrence of war. If the peace fighters achieve victory in this area, if the tense situation in Asia is eased through the convening of a political conference, this will be a help to the struggle of the people of all countries for a peaceful settlement of the German question."

Sokhey pointed out: "The negotiations between the United States and Pakistan on the establishment of military bases in Pakistan are a despicable attempt to stir up war hysteria in the region, create discord between India and Pakistan, and create divisions among the Arab countries of Asia."

He emphasized that the establishment of military bases on foreign territory violates the United Nations Charter.

The last speaker was Dassthier de la Vigerie (France). He said, "The people of all countries are paying close attention to how France decides to deal with the so-called 'European Army' issue. The debate in the French Parliament proves the unprecedented failure of the supporters of the 'European Defence Community' in France. The speeches of political leaders such as Daladier, Duclos, and de Gaulle show that the opinion of the French people is consistent. All strata of the French people oppose the 'European Defence Community'. They demand that a policy of consultation be substituted for a policy of strength, and that the freedom and independence of France be restored. We must continue to fight to unite all peace-loving forces in our country. The French people know that, together with the people of other countries, they can smash all plans for the remilitarization of Germany."

Vigerie supported Ehrenburg's suggestion in his speech that both sides should abide by the Franco-Soviet Treaty. He said: "In France, more and more political leaders are willing to make the Franco-Soviet Treaty serve the cause of consolidating peace." Vigerie concluded by saying that the political and social forces in favor of easing international tensions are growing. We must organize a conference attended by representatives of these forces, and we must organize a congress of peace advocates.

After Vigerie's speech, the World Peace Council meeting concluded its discussion of the agenda. Subsequently, the meeting discussed and approved the resolutions put forward by the various committees.

Eugenie Cotton, Chairman of the Cultural Committee, read out the draft resolution on promoting cultural relations between the peoples of all countries. The meeting unanimously adopted this resolution.

Based on the recommendation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, the meeting adopted a resolution to commemorate four major cultural figures of the world in 1954: the 200th anniversary of the death of British writer Fielding, the 50th anniversary of the death of Chekhov, the 50th anniversary of the death of Czech composer Dvořák, and the 2,400th anniversary of the birth of Aristophanes.

Professor Rosenkoyest of Norway read out the letter to scientists of all countries from the scientists attending the meeting, calling on them to strive for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The meeting also unanimously approved the list of new members of the International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Review Committee proposed by writer Jorge Amado.

The meeting adopted a general resolution calling on the people of all countries to strengthen the struggle for peace, and adopted the World Peace Council's letter to organizations and individuals hoping to ease international tensions, suggesting the preparation of an international conference to discuss the issue of easing international tensions.

Finally, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, Pietro Nenni, delivered the closing speech. He said that 314 representatives from 59 countries participated in the meeting. The meeting discussed issues related to Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America, Africa and Australia. A general demand emerged from the discussion of these issues - the establishment of peace.

Nenni said that now, everything depends on the strength and awareness of the masses, and on the expansion of the peace movement. The World Peace Council, fully aware of its responsibilities, passed a resolution to hold an international conference of all those who advocate consultation to ease international tensions. This defines the new tasks of the national peace committees. The achievements of each peace committee in the future will be a testimony to the achievements of the peace struggle, and will make it possible for us to gather together again in a few months with greater confidence in the victory of the struggle, which is not only the struggle of our movement, but also the struggle of all mankind who aspire to peace and progress.

Amidst the stormy and prolonged applause of the participants, Pietro Nenni announced the close of the World Peace Council meeting.

    世界和平理事会维也纳会议闭幕
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十八日讯：世界和平理事会维也纳会议已在二十八日闭幕。会议通过了关于号召各国人民加强为世界和平而斗争的总决议；并通过了世界和平理事会告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书、出席世界和平理事会维也纳会议的科学家告各国科学家书和关于促进各国人民之间的文化关系的决议等。会议根据世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德的建议，一致通过了世界和平理事会新理事和世界和平理事会常务委员会新委员的名单。
    在闭幕会议上，埃及代表阿卜杜拉·拉赫曼·夏尔卡维发言后，前德国总理约瑟夫·维尔特发言。他说，我们以非常高兴和满意的心情得知苏联最近的表示苏联政府参加四大国会议的意愿的照会。苏联的倡议使得四大国会议的召开成为可能，这个会议将有助于使德国人民免除西德变成军事基地的威胁。维尔特指出：必须把求得与一切国家、一切邻国间的和平与谅解的这种思想作为德国外交政策的一个原则。他说：在西德存在着强大的反对复仇与军国主义政策的力量。我们的任务是把它的仍然分散的力量团结成为一股万众一心的反对力量，使他们成为有决定意义的政治因素。
    维尔特说，民主德国所进行的斗争，正在得到一切爱好和平的人民以及世界各国人民的信任。在和平的、重新统一的德国，政策必须由民主力量来制订。这就可以保证我们能对邻国提供安全，并将是我们对于伟大的欧洲和世界和平事业的贡献。
    接着，印度的萨希布·辛格·索克发言。他说，我毫不怀疑，诚恳的谈判的方法最后一定会取得优势。某些国家不希望朝鲜问题和其他国际争端的和平解决。在解决朝鲜问题时一定会不断发生各种困难，但是我们必须防止战争的再起。如果和平战士们在这一方面取得了胜利，如果通过政治会议的召开，亚洲的紧张局势得以缓和，这对各国人民争取和平解决德国问题的斗争将是一个帮助。
    索克指出：美国和巴基斯坦所进行的关于在巴基斯坦建立军事基地的谈判，是一个卑鄙的企图，目的在煽起这一地区的战争歇斯底里，制造印度和巴基斯坦的不和，并造成亚洲阿拉伯国家的分歧。
    他强调说，在外国领土上建立军事基地违反了联合国宪章。
    最后一个发言的是达斯第埃·德·拉·维热里
  （法国）。他说，各国人民非常注意法国决定如何对待所谓“欧洲军”问题。法国议会的辩论证明了法国的“欧洲防务集团”支持者的空前失败。像达拉第、杜克洛、戴高乐这样一些政治领袖的发言，说明法国人民的意见是一致的。各阶层的法国人民都反对“欧洲防务集团”。他们要求用协商政策来代替实力政策，要求恢复法国的自由与独立。我们必须继续为团结我国所有爱好和平力量而斗争。法国人民知道，他们与其他各国人民一道，可以粉碎德国重新军国主义化的一切计划。
    维热里支持爱伦堡在发言中提到的要求双方遵守法苏条约的主张。他说：在法国，愿意使法苏条约为巩固和平的事业服务的政治领袖是越来越多了。维热里最后说，赞成缓和国际紧张局势的政治和社会力量正在增长。我们必须组织一次由这些力量的代表参加的会议，我们必须组织和平拥护者的大会。
  维热里发言后，世界和平理事会会议结束了关于议程的讨论。接着，会议讨论和批准各委员会提出的决议。
    文化委员会主席欧仁妮·戈登宣读了关于促进各国人民之间文化关系的决议案。会议一致通过了这个决议。
    根据世界和平理事会常务委员会的建议，会议通过在一九五四年纪念世界四大文化名人的决议，四大文化名人是：英国作家菲尔丁逝世二百周年，契诃夫逝世五十周年，捷克作曲家德沃夏克逝世五十周年，阿里斯托芬诞生二千四百周年。
    挪威罗森科伊斯特教授宣读了出席会议的科学家告各国科学家书，号召他们争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器。会议并一致通过了作家若热·亚马多提出的国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会新委员名单。
    会议通过了号召各国人民加强和平斗争的总决议，并通过世界和平理事会告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书，建议筹备一次国际会议，讨论缓和国际局势问题。
    会议最后由世界和平理事会副主席彼特罗·南尼致闭幕词。他说，代表五十九个国家的三百一十四名代表参加了会议。会上讨论了有关欧洲、亚洲、北美、拉丁美洲、非洲和澳大利亚的各种问题。从这些问题的讨论中得出一个总的要求——建立和平。
    南尼说，现在，一切都决定于群众的力量和觉悟，决定于和平运动的扩大。世界和平理事会由于充分认识到自己的责任，通过了凡是主张协商以缓和国际紧张局势的人举行国际会议的决议。这就规定了各国和平委员会新的任务。每一个和平委员会将来达到的成果都将是和平斗争所获得的成就的证明，并使得我们有可能在几个月后以对斗争的更大的必胜信心聚首一堂，这个斗争不仅仅是我们的运动的斗争，而且也是热望和平和进步的全体人类的斗争。
    在与会者暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声中，彼特罗·南尼宣布世界和平理事会会议闭幕。
