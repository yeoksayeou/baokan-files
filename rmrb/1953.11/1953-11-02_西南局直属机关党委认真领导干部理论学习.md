The directly subordinate organs of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have formally started studying Chapter 9 of "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" and "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" since the beginning of September this year. Thanks to the active leadership of the directly subordinate organs Party Committee, most comrades can adhere to normal study.

Before and after the start of the semester, the directly subordinate organs Party Committee focused on carrying out a series of organizational preparations and ideological mobilization work. At the Party Committee meetings, the issue of cadre theoretical study was discussed several times, and it was decided that the Party Committee Secretary should concurrently serve as the Principal of the spare-time political school. A group of full-time theory instructors, work cadres, and tutors were carefully selected and equipped. In view of the past situation in which some organ branches neglected cadre theoretical study, the Party Committee formulated key points for branch work, instructing all branches to earnestly strengthen ideological leadership and cadre theoretical education. At the joint meeting of branch secretaries held in August, it was clearly pointed out that doing a good job in cadre theoretical education is the main content and primary task of the ideological leadership work of the organ branches. All branches have conducted ideological mobilization among the students of their units in accordance with this spirit and have focused on solving issues such as adjusting compilation levels. After the start of the semester, thanks to the Party Committee's regular inspection and supervision, all branches have attached importance to cadre theoretical study. The Southwest Bureau's Organization Department, United Front Work Department, and other organ branches can regularly study the issue of cadre theoretical study, regularly check the learning situation of cadres, and pay attention to strengthening learning guidance, listening to reports from tutors, and working with tutors to study problems, summarize experiences, and help tutors solve difficult problems in a timely manner.

The Party Committee also attaches great importance to the cultivation and assistance of theory instructors. It has selected a group of tutors with better quality to study at the Southwest Bureau Party School's theory instructor training class, and regularly sends people to understand their learning situation and help them solve ideological problems. Before the start of the semester, the Party Committee conscientiously helped the full-time theory instructors of the elementary group prepare the first chapter of the course "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction." At the two meetings of elementary group instructors convened by the Party Committee, the key points of the lecture were first pointed out to everyone, and reference materials were provided. Then, the instructors drafted detailed lecture notes. After the lecture notes were initially reviewed by the Party Committee, the instructors gave a preliminary lecture at a meeting attended by members of the Party Committee and all tutors. After the preliminary lecture, the attendees discussed the content of the preliminary lecture, put forward opinions, and the instructors revised the lecture notes. Subsequently, the instructors conducted trial lectures in key units; tutors and group leaders from other units were invited to participate in the trial lectures. Some members of the Party Committee and full-time education work cadres also attended the lectures. After the trial lecture, a forum was immediately organized for the listeners to collect opinions and invite instructors to study, and the lecture notes were revised and supplemented. During the formal lectures, the Party Committee continued to collect students' opinions for the instructors to refer to in the next lecture. Because the Party Committee can conscientiously help instructors prepare lessons and absorb tutors to participate in the discussion of lecture notes, it ensures that instructors make fewer or no mistakes when lecturing, and also allows tutors to learn one step ahead, which is convenient for conducting tutoring work.

In the process of study, the Party Committee also regularly sends people to check the guidance work of each branch on the study. The Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Secretary also personally convened a joint meeting of study group leaders of the senior group to check the learning situation of the senior group and solve some problems that could be solved in a timely manner. When the elementary group was studying the first chapter of "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction," the Party Committee successively convened three tutor meetings to arrange the study plan before previewing, point out the key points of previewing; after the lecture and before the review, collect students' opinions on the lecture, arrange the key points of review and discussion topics, and study how to prepare for the "classroom discussion"; after the "classroom discussion," check the learning effect of this chapter, summarize the experience and preliminarily study the learning plan for the second chapter. In addition, three meetings of intermediate group tutors have also been convened. Because the Party Committee has grasped the guidance work, it has been able to understand the learning situation and existing problems of each unit and each level group in a timely manner and ensure the implementation of the theoretical learning plan.

    西南局直属机关党委认真领导干部理论学习
    中共中央西南局直属机关在职干部，自今年九月初正式开始“联共（布）党史”第九章和“经济建设常识”的学习以来，由于直属机关党委的积极领导，一般同志都能坚持正常的学习。
    在开学前后，直属机关党委着重进行了一系列的组织准备和思想动员工作。在党委的会议上，曾数次讨论了干部理论学习的问题，并决定由党委书记兼任业余政治学校总校的校长，又认真挑选和配备了一批专职的理论教员、工作干部和辅导员。鉴于过去某些机关支部忽视干部理论学习的情况，党委制订了支部工作要点，指示各支部切实加强思想领导工作和干部理论教育。并在八月间召开的支部书记联席会议上明确指出：搞好干部理论教育是机关支部思想领导工作的主要内容和首要任务。各支部都根据这一精神在本单位学员中进行了思想动员，并着重解决了调整编级等问题。开学后，由于党委的经常检查、督促，各支部都已重视干部理论学习。西南局组织部、统一战线工作部等机关支部，都能经常研究干部理论学习问题，定期检查干部的学习情况，并注意加强学习辅导工作，听取辅导员汇报情况，和辅导员一起研究问题，总结经验，及时帮助辅导员解决疑难问题。
    党委对培养和帮助理论教员问题，也是十分重视的，曾挑选了一批质量较好的辅导员到西南局党校理论教员训练班学习，并经常派人了解他们的学习情况，帮助他们解决思想问题。在开学前，党委认真地帮助初级组专职理论教员准备“经济建设常识”第一章的课程。在党委召开的两次初级组教员会议上，先向大家指出讲授的重点，供给参考资料，然后由教员拟写详细的讲稿。讲稿经党委初审后，由教员在党委委员和全体辅导员参加的会上进行预讲。预讲后，由出席人讨论预讲内容，提出意见，再由教员补正讲稿。随后由教员在重点单位进行试讲；试讲时吸收其他单位的辅导员和小组长参加。党委的若干委员和专职教育工作干部也出席听讲。试讲后，立即组织听讲者座谈，收集意见，并邀集教员研究，对讲稿作修订补充。正式讲课中，党委又继续收集学员的意见，供教员在下次讲课时参考。由于党委能认真帮助教员备课，吸收辅导员参加讨论讲稿，保证了教员在讲课时少出或不出错误，又使辅导员先学一步，便于进行辅导工作。
    在学习过程中，党委还经常派人检查各支部对学习的辅导工作。党委书记和副书记还亲自召开高级组学习小组长联席会议，检查高级组的学习情况，及时解决某些可能解决的问题。在初级组学习“经济建设常识”第一章时，党委曾先后召开了三次辅导员会议，布置预习前的学习计划，指出预习要点；在讲课后和复习前，收集学员对讲课的意见，布置复习重点和讨论题，并研究如何做好“课堂讨论”的准备工作；在“课堂讨论”后，检查本章的学习效果，总结经验并初步研究第二章的学习计划。此外，还召开过三次中级组辅导员会议。由于党委抓紧了辅导工作，因而能够及时了解各单位、各级组的学习情况和存在的问题，并保证了理论学习计划的贯彻执行。
