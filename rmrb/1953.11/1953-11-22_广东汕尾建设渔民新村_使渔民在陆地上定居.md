Guangdong Shanwei Builds Fishermen's New Village
To Settle Fishermen on Land

    A fishermen's new village is being built on the coast of Shanwei, Guangdong Province, to enable the fishermen of Xingang to settle on land. After the establishment of the Fishermen's New Village Construction Committee in early September, it immediately led the work. The first step was to raise the base of the new village by two feet, and open a ditch on the southeast and southwest sides of the village for drainage during the rainy season. A tide barrier was built outside the ditch, and three wells were dug in the village to supply drinking water for the fishermen in the new village. The fishermen's new village has now completed more than 140 wooden houses and boat houses, and 68 fishermen's families have moved into their new homes. Fishermen Xu Meidi received 500,000 yuan in relief funds from the People's Government, plus his own savings, and built a new house that can accommodate six people. He said excitedly: "In the past, we didn't dare to build houses even if we had money. First, we were afraid that the Kuomintang reactionaries would find fault and extort money if they knew the fishermen had money, and second, we were afraid that they would take advantage of the fishermen going to sea to insult women. Therefore, we had to live in the stern of the boat, bending over and bowing our backs. Today, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our fishermen can straighten our backs and truly be a person." For many years, the fishermen of Xingang lived in the stern of the boat on the sea or in the broken boats on the Xingang beach to avoid the extortion and insults of bullies, gangsters, and Kuomintang bandits. In the big typhoon of 1937, nearly 100 fishing boats sank in Xingang, and 400 or 500 fishermen were drowned. It was not until after liberation that their suffering was gradually relieved. Now, the People's Government has allocated another 80 million yuan to help them build a new village, so that they can move to Shanwei and live on land. The construction plan also includes deepening Pinqing Lake to build a typhoon shelter, building a typhoon warning station on Fengfei Mountain, erecting an over-the-sea power line between Shanwei and Xingang, purchasing first-aid boats specially for fishermen, and building a fishermen's health station, etc., to further protect the health and safety of fishermen.

    广东汕尾建设渔民新村
    使渔民在陆地上定居
    广东省汕尾海边上正在建设一座渔民新村，使得新港渔民能够在陆地上定居。渔民新村建设委员会在九月上旬成立以后，马上领导进行工作。首先是把新村基地垫高二尺，在村的东南和西南方各开一条水沟，以便雨季排水，沟外筑起挡潮堤，村中开掘三口水井，供新村渔民饮食用水。渔民新村现在已完成一百四十多所木房和船屋，已有六十八户渔民搬入了新居。渔工徐妹弟得到了人民政府五十万元救济款，加上自己的积存，盖起一座能住六个人的新屋。他兴奋地说：“过去有钱也不敢盖屋，一怕国民党反动派知道渔民有钱，就要找岔子敲竹杠，二怕他们趁渔民出海来侮辱妇女，因此只好住在后船里，出入弯腰折背。今天有了共产党和毛主席的领导，我们渔民才能伸直腰，真正作一个人。”多少年来，新港渔民为了躲避恶霸、流氓和国民党匪帮的敲榨和侮辱，便长年住在海上的后船或新港沙滩上的破船里。一九三七年的大台风，新港沉没了近百只渔船，淹死了四、五百个渔民。直到解放以后，他们的苦难才逐渐解除。现在，人民政府又拨款八千万元，帮助他们建设新村，使他们搬到汕尾，住到陆地上来。建设计划中还准备把品清湖挖深，建成避风塘，凤飞山上建筑台风警报站，汕尾与新港间架设过海电线，购买专为渔民使用的急救船，建设渔民保健站等，以进一步保障渔民的健康和安全。　　（洪泉声）
