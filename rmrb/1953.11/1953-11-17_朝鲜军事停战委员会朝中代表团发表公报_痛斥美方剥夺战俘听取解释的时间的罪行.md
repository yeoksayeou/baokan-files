   Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the issue of individual explanation time on November 4th and 5th:

    Since the Korean-Chinese side began explanation work on November 4th and 5th, certain members or representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have emphasized that the explanation time was too long, considering it so-called "mental abuse" of the prisoners of war. The Swiss member threatened to revise the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" stipulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to limit the time for prisoners of war to listen to explanations. He even threatened to withdraw from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it impossible to implement the "Terms of Reference" at all.

    During this period, the US side also instructed Kuomintang bandit secret agent elements in Camp No. 22 to use the excuse that the explanation time was too long to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations, causing the explanation work to be interrupted for the fourth time since November 6th, lasting for eight days so far.

    This attack on the so-called excessive explanation time is part of the US strategy to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work. It originated from the fact that Yue Heidan, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, finally broke through his concerns and decided to request repatriation after a relatively long period of explanation on October 17th. The process of Yue Heidan listening to explanations and requesting repatriation made the US side see clearly that a longer period of explanation would help break the prisoners of war's fear and allow them to dare to request to go home. Therefore, the US side insisted on limiting the explanation time and used this as another weapon for them to sabotage the "Terms of Reference." This can be proved by the protest made by US Brigadier General Hamblen to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 19th regarding this incident, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's reply to the protest on October 30th.

    On November 4th, Yu Wanming, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, decided to request repatriation after two hours of explanation. This incident prompted the US side to further use the excuse that the explanation time was too long to instigate secret agents to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations, carrying out new sabotage activities. The US side attempted to deprive the prisoners of war on the Korean-Chinese side of the opportunity to listen to explanations and consider repatriation by limiting the time. If this goal could not be achieved, the US side was prepared to fundamentally sabotage the explanation work through the above-mentioned sabotage activities, tear up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and shift the responsibility to the Korean-Chinese side.

    However, the US's absurd attack on the so-called excessive explanation time is groundless. Facts have proved that it is not that the Korean-Chinese side took too long to explain, but rather that the obstruction and interruption activities of US secret agents and US "representatives" prevented the Korean-Chinese side from completing its daily explanation work to the prisoners of war according to plan. Therefore, the US side must bear serious responsibility for this criminal act of sabotaging the explanation and sabotaging the "Terms of Reference" and its consequences. And certain members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only failed to stop the US's sabotage, but also participated in interrupting the explanation from time to time, so they cannot escape their due responsibility for the current situation and its consequences.

    The so-called claim that the explanation time is too long is completely inconsistent with the facts. The length of the explanation time should be based on the actual time the prisoners of war spend listening to the explanation. During the explanation work on November 4th and 5th, although some prisoners of war stayed in the explanation tents for a relatively long time, most of this time was occupied by obstruction activities by secret agents or prisoners of war coerced by secret agents, as well as interruption activities by US representatives and certain Swiss and Swedish representatives in various subsidiary organizations. Therefore, the actual time the prisoners of war spent listening to the explanation was not long. The facts are as follows:

    On November 4th, the Korean-Chinese side originally planned to explain to nearly five hundred prisoners of war, but due to various undue obstructions during the explanation work, in addition to the routine "opening remarks" and "closing remarks" of the chairmen of the various subsidiary organizations taking up some time, only two hundred and two people were explained to. Excluding the noon break, the time to bring the prisoners of war from the waiting area to the explanation tents, and the time the prisoners of war did not enter the tents, the time this group of prisoners of war stayed in the explanation tents was a total of one hundred and sixty-six hours and fifty-eight minutes, with an average stay of just over forty-nine minutes per prisoner of war. However, in this day's explanation work, the "opening remarks" and "closing remarks" of the chairmen of the subsidiary organizations of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in each explanation tent took a total of thirteen hours and twenty-five minutes. Due to the obstruction of the US's so-called "representatives" and Swiss and Swedish representatives, the explanation work was interrupted for a total of nine hours and thirty-six minutes. The time occupied by secret agents and prisoners of war coerced by secret agents that made it impossible to carry out the explanation work reached forty-seven hours and eleven minutes. The intermediate break time was two hours and fifty-two minutes. These times, which were counted in the explanation time but did not actually involve any explanation, totaled seventy-three hours and four minutes. Therefore, the actual time spent by the Korean-Chinese side in carrying out the explanation work was only ninety-three hours and fifty-four minutes, with an average of just over twenty-seven minutes of actual explanation time per prisoner of war. In fact, many prisoners of war did not listen to the explanation for that long. For example, in tent No. 14, one prisoner of war actually listened to the explanation for only one minute; in tent No. 29, one prisoner of war listened for only six minutes; in tent No. 1, one prisoner of war listened for only five minutes. This situation was common in all explanation tents.

    On November 5th, for the same reasons as on the 4th, the Korean-Chinese side only explained to one hundred and twenty-four people out of the five hundred prisoners of war planned for explanation. The time this group of prisoners of war stayed in the explanation tents was a total of one hundred and fifty-eight hours, with an average stay of just over seventy-six minutes per person. However, in this day's explanation work, the "opening remarks" and "closing remarks" of the chairmen of the subsidiary organizations took a total of ten hours and three minutes. The time the explanation was interrupted due to the obstruction of the US "representatives" and Swiss and Swedish representatives was a total of ten hours and fifty-five minutes. The time wasted due to the obstruction of secret agents and prisoners of war coerced by secret agents that made it impossible to carry out the explanation reached forty-three hours and fifty minutes. The intermediate break was four hours and forty minutes. These times, which did not actually involve any explanation, totaled sixty-nine hours and twenty-eight minutes. Therefore, the actual time spent by the Korean-Chinese side in carrying out the explanation was only eighty-eight hours and thirty-two minutes, with an average of just over forty-two minutes of actual explanation time per prisoner of war. In fact, many prisoners of war listened to the explanation for a very short time. For example, in tent No. 13, one prisoner of war listened to the explanation for seven minutes; in tent No. 29, one prisoner of war left without listening to the explanation at all; in tent No. 11, one prisoner of war listened for only four minutes; in tent No. 14, one prisoner of war listened for only seven minutes, and another prisoner of war listened for only nine minutes.

    For prisoners of war who have suffered three years of persecution, deception, and poisoning in US prisoner of war camps, an average of only twenty-seven to forty-two minutes of explanation work has been carried out per person, which is clearly not "too long" but too short. Moreover, many prisoners of war have not even heard such a short explanation. Take explanation tent No. 25 as an example. In this tent, the Korean-Chinese side explained to six prisoners of war on the 4th. The actual time each prisoner of war spent listening to the explanation was: fifteen minutes for two people, twenty minutes for one person, thirty minutes for one person, thirty-three minutes for one person, and thirty-five minutes for one person. In the same tent, the Korean-Chinese side explained to six prisoners of war on the 5th. The actual time each prisoner of war spent listening to the explanation was: ten minutes for two people, twelve minutes for one person, fifteen minutes for one person, thirty-three minutes for one person, and only one person for seventy-five minutes. The situation in other explanation tents was roughly the same as in tent No. 25, with only a few individual prisoners of war spending a relatively long time in the explanation tent on the surface, but in reality, they did not spend long listening to the explanation.

    From the above situation, the Korean-Chinese side only spent a little more than half of the total time the prisoners of war stayed in the explanation tents actually explaining to them. Clearly, if the explanation time is too long, the responsibility should lie with the US side, which deliberately obstructs and sabotages the explanation work. The actual problem is that the US side is using various obstructive activities to deprive the prisoners of war of the time to listen to the explanation and consider repatriation, rather than the Korean-Chinese side prolonging the explanation time. The Yu Wanming incident fully proves this point. On November 4th, Yu Wanming listened to the explanation in explanation tent No. 3. The explanation work started at 10:44 am and ended at 2:30 pm with Yu Wanming requesting repatriation. Excluding the 84 minutes for lunch, the "opening remarks" and "closing remarks" of the chairmen of the subsidiary organizations, and the break time, the actual time spent listening to the explanation was approximately 120 minutes. When Yu Wanming started listening to the explanation, he was suspicious and shouted "Return to Taiwan" according to the orders of the secret agents, but after half an hour of explanation, he said that "Returning to Taiwan" was not his voluntary wish. Later, after repeated and patient explanations by our explanation representatives, advising him to return to the country to live a peaceful life, he gradually dispelled his doubts and finally voluntarily requested repatriation.

    After the Yu Wanming incident, the US side hyped up the so-called excessive explanation time and the so-called "mental abuse" of the prisoners of war. However, what the Yu Wanming incident proved was exactly the opposite of what the US side was shouting. The Yu Wanming incident proved that many of the prisoners of war who have been subjected to the violence and control of US secret agents for a long time need sufficient time to listen to the explanation in order to dispel their fears and doubts and request repatriation. On November 4th, there was a prisoner of war in the same situation as Yu Wanming who had repeatedly shown a desire to request repatriation. However, during the entire one hour and forty minutes he stayed in the explanation tent, every time he expressed a desire for repatriation, the Swedish representative proposed to interrupt the explanation. In the end, this prisoner of war was taken away without the consent of the Korean-Chinese side, so that the actual explanation time for him was only seven minutes. Clearly, this prisoner of war was deprived of the time to listen to the explanation, so he could not realize his desire for repatriation.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团发表公报
    痛斥美方剥夺战俘听取解释的时间的罪行
   【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团就十一月四日和五日进行个别解释的时间问题发表公报如下：
    自十一月四日和五日朝中方面进行解释工作以来，中立国遣返委员会的某些委员或代表即强调声称解释时间太长，认为是对于战俘的所谓“精神虐待”。瑞士委员曾威胁要求修改中立国遣返委员会所规定的“解释和访问工作细则”，以便限制战俘听取解释的时间。他甚至曾一度威胁要退出中立国遣返委员会，使“职权范围”根本无法实施。
    在此时期中，美方也指使其在第二十二号营场中的国民党匪帮特务分子藉口解释时间太长，不许战俘出营场听取解释，以致解释工作从十一月六日起即第四次陷于中断，迄今为时已有八天。
    这一次关于所谓解释时间太长的攻击，是美国方面阻挠破坏解释工作的策略中的一部分。其起因是中国人民志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦在十月十七日经过较长时间的解释之后，终于打破顾虑，决定要求遣返。岳黑旦听取解释和要求遣返的过程，使美方看清：较长时间的解释将有助于打破战俘的恐惧，使之敢于要求回家。因此，美方即坚持限制解释时间，并以之为他们破坏“职权范围”的又一武器。这可由美方汉布伦准将在十月十九日对该事件向中立国遣返委员会提出的抗议，以及中立国遣返委员会在十月三十日对于该项抗议的答复加以证明。
    十一月四日，中国人民志愿军被俘人员余万明经过两小时的解释以后决定要求遣返。这一事件促使美方更加藉口解释时间太长而进行指使特务不许战俘出营场听取解释的新的破坏活动。美方企图以限制时间来剥夺朝中方面被俘人员听取解释、考虑遣返的机会。如果不能达到这一目的，美方即准备借上述破坏活动根本破坏解释工作，撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，而将责任推卸于朝中方面。
    但是，美方所谓解释时间太长的荒谬攻击是毫无根据的。事实证明：并不是朝中方面进行解释的时间太长，而是美方特务及美方“代表”的阻挠和中断活动致使朝中方面不能按照计划，完成其每日对战俘的解释工作。因此，美方必须对这种破坏解释、破坏“职权范围”的罪恶行为及其后果负起严重的责任。而中立国遣返委员会某些委员对于美方的破坏行为不仅不加以制止，反而时时参加来中断解释，这样，他们对于目前情势及其后果，也是不能逃避他们应负的责任的。
    所谓解释时间太长的说法，完全不合乎事实。解释时间的长短应以战俘实际听取解释的时间为准。在十一月四、五两日解释工作进行中，有的战俘虽然在解释帐篷中停留的时间较长，但其中大部分时间均为特务或受特务胁迫的战俘的阻挠活动以及美方代表和各附属机构中某些瑞士、瑞典代表的中断解释的活动所占去，因此，战俘实际听取解释的时间并不长。其事实如下：
    在十一月四日，朝中方面原定向将近五百名战俘进行解释，但是由于在解释工作进行中，除了各附属机构主席例行的“开场白”和“结束语”费去
  一部分时间外，还遭受到各种不应有的阻挠，因而只解释了二百零二人。除去中午休息时间，将战俘从等候解释地点带到解释帐篷的时间，以及战俘未进入帐篷的其他时间以外，这批战俘停留在解释帐篷里的时间一共是一百六十六小时又五十八分钟，每个战俘平均停留时间是四十九分钟强。但是在这一天的解释工作中，中立国遣返委员会在各解释帐篷的附属机构主席对战俘讲的“开场白”和
  “结束语”，一共用去了十三小时又二十五分钟。由于美方的所谓“代表”以及瑞士、瑞典代表的阻挠，解释工作一共中断了九小时又三十六分钟。由于特务分子以及受特务胁迫的战俘阻挠以致解释工作无法进行而占去的时间，共达四十七小时又十一分钟。中间休息时间为二小时又五十二分钟。这些算在解释时间之内，但实际上没有进行解释的时间，一共有七十三小时又四分钟。因此，朝中方面进行解释工作的实际时间，只有九十三小时又五十四分钟，平均每个战俘实际听解释的时间只有二十七分钟强。而实际上，许多战俘听取解释的时间还没有这样久。例如，在十四号帐篷，一名战俘实际听取解释时间只有一分钟；二十九号帐篷一名战俘只有六分钟；一号帐篷一名战俘只有五分钟。这种情况在各个解释帐篷普遍存在。
    十一月五日，朝中方面由于与四日同样的原因，在计划对之解释的五百名战俘中，只解释了一百二十四人。这批战俘停留在解释帐篷里的时间一共是一百五十八小时，每人平均停留时间是七十六分钟强。但是在这一天解释工作中，附属机构主席的“开场白”和“结束语”共用去了十小时又三分钟。由于美方“代表”以及瑞士、瑞典代表阻挠以致解释中断的时间一共是十小时又五十五分钟。由于特务分子以及受特务胁迫的战俘的阻挠以致解释无法进行而浪费的时间一共是四十三小时又五十分钟。中间休息四小时又四十分钟。这些实际上没有进行解释的时间一共是六十九小时又二十八分钟。因此，朝中方面实际进行解释的时间只有八十八小时又三十二分钟，平均每个战俘实际听解释的时间只有四十二分钟强。而实际上，许多战俘听取解释的时间很短。例如，在十三号帐篷，一名战俘听取解释的时间是七分钟；二十九号帐篷一名战俘根本未听解释就走掉了；十一号帐篷一名战俘只有四分钟；十四号帐篷一名战俘只有七分钟，另一名战俘只有九分钟。
    对于在美方战俘营中受了三年迫害、欺骗、毒化的战俘，平均每人只进行了二十七分钟到四十二分钟的解释工作，这显然不是“太长”而是太短。何况，有许多战俘连这样短时间的解释都没有听到。以二十五号解释帐篷为例，在这个帐篷中，朝中方面四日向六名战俘进行了解释。各个战俘实际听取解释的时间是：十五分钟者两人，二十分钟者一人，三十分钟者一人，三十三分钟者一人，三十五分钟者一人。在同一帐篷中，朝中方面五日向六名战俘进行了解释。各个战俘实际听取解释的时间是：十分钟者两人，十二分钟者一人，十五分钟者一人，三十三分钟者一人，只有一人是七十五分钟。其他各解释帐篷中的情形都和二十五号帐篷中的情形大致相同，只有个别战俘表面上在解释帐篷内的时间较长，但实际上他们听取解释的时间并不长。
    从上述情况看来，在战俘停留于解释帐篷内的全部时间中，朝中方面大约只有一半多一点的时间实际向他们进行解释。显然，如果解释时间太长，其责任应属于蓄意阻挠和破坏解释工作的美方。实际问题是美方利用各种阻挠活动，剥夺了战俘听取解释、考虑遣返的时间，而不是朝中方面拖长了解释时间。余万明事件就充分证明了这一点。十一月四日，余万明在第三号解释帐篷听取解释。解释工作从上午十时四十四分开始，到下午二时三十分，以余万明要求遣返而结束。中间除吃午饭八十四分钟，附属机构主席的“开场白”和“结束语”以及休息时间外，实际听取解释的时间约为一百二十分钟。余万明在开始听取解释时心怀疑惧，按着特务分子的命令叫嚷“回台湾”，但经过半小时解释以后，他就说“回台湾”并不是他自愿的。以后经我方解释代表反复耐心解释，劝他回国过和平生活，他才逐渐消除疑惧心理，最后自动要求遣返。
    在余万明事件发生以后，美方就大肆渲染所谓解释时间太长和所谓对战俘的“精神虐待”。然而余万明事件所证明的，却和美方所叫嚷的恰恰相反。余万明事件证明：久受美方特务暴力控制的战俘，其中有许多人正是需要有充分时间来听取解释，才能驱除恐惧和疑虑而要求遣返的。在十一月四日，就有一名和余万明同样情况的战俘，曾经多次显露要求遣返的愿望。但是，在他停留于解释帐篷的一
  小时又四十分的全部时间内，每当他流露遣返愿望时，瑞典代表即提议中断解释，最后这个战俘并不经朝中方面同意就被带走，以致实际对他的解释时
  间仅仅有七分钟。显然，这个战俘是由于被剥夺了
  听取解释的时间，因此不能实现其遣返的愿望的。
