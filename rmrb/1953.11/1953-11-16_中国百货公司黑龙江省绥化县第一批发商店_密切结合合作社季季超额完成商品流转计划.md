China Department Store Heilongjiang Province Suihua County First Wholesale Store
Closely Combines with Cooperatives to Exceed Commodity Circulation Plan Every Quarter

The First Wholesale Store of the Suihua County Company of the China Department Store in Heilongjiang Province (hereinafter referred to as Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store) has exceeded its plan in the first, second, and third quarters of this year. The store's annual commodity circulation plan accounts for 50 percent of the county department store's total plan. In addition to ensuring the completion of the plan in the fourth quarter, it plans to overfulfill it by 1.527 billion yuan as a production increase and economy practice plan. By the end of October, it has completed 30 percent of the quarterly plan.

The main reason why this store can exceed its commodity circulation plan every quarter is that it can closely combine with cooperatives and strive to use advanced work methods. The specific practices are:

First, study the needs of the people and base the sales plan on the sales plan of the cooperatives: the sales volume of this store through cooperative sales averages over 80 percent per quarter. In the third quarter of this year, under the leadership of the Finance and Trade Department of the Suihua County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the county cooperative union, state-owned commercial and cooperative joint office, and the director of the county wholesale store conducted a typical survey in the Xin Sheng Village Cooperative in the Second District, specifically clarifying the purchasing power of farmers at all levels in the fourth quarter, and investigating the quantity, time, and specifications of the main commodities needed. The Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store signed a seasonal and monthly supply contract based on the source of goods, inventory quantity, and the village cooperative's supply capacity and capital situation. The Finance and Trade Department of the County Party Committee, the Industry and Commerce Section of the County People's Government, the County Federation, and the State-owned Commercial and Cooperative Joint Office supervised the implementation. At the same time, based on the time when farmers sell grain, the quantity was determined to supply 35 percent in October, 40 percent in November, and 25 percent in December. Then, the county party committee convened a county-wide state-owned commercial and cooperative material exchange meeting. The Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store set up a commodity exhibition room, organized the directors of each village cooperative to visit, and signed supply contracts with the cooperatives of each village in the county. This kind of exchange meeting was held once every quarter this year. This process, from typical investigation to comprehensive contract signing, not only enables us to understand the needs of farmers, but also balances the production and sales situation and the plan of the County Cooperative Federation, so that the wholesale store can have a clear idea of ​​organizing major commodities.

Second, implement expanding wholesale business to further support the development of cooperatives: The Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store satisfies the requirements of cooperatives, fixed users, and private retailers for commodities with sufficient supply. For commodities that are currently small in quantity, temporarily have difficulty in supply, and are urgently needed by consumers, the needs of rural cooperatives are met first. In terms of distribution, priority is given to cooperatives with plans, and the remaining portion is determined according to the size of the supply range of each village cooperative and the length of time since the last pickup. Then, the communication network is used to inform the cooperatives of each village and limit the time for picking up the goods to within five days after the letter arrives. This can take care of the cooperatives in remote areas. At the same time, organize teams to go to the countryside, often carrying samples and commodity catalogs to introduce new commodities to the cooperatives, and help open up sales. The store learned from the experience of the Fengcheng Department Store Wholesale Department and established a communication network. From August to now, a total of 408 letters have been sent, printing and distributing commodity catalogs with prices each time goods arrive, and notifying cooperatives to come and buy.

In addition to closely combining with cooperatives, the Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store has also established normal relationships with fixed users. The original 22 fixed user units have increased to 26 units. For fixed users with a foundation, establish a supply plan and submit a quarterly and monthly plan in advance so as to organize the supply as soon as possible. For fixed users in the production department, each team has a dedicated person responsible for understanding and mastering the production needs and preparing the supply of materials on time. For commodities that users need but are not in sufficient stock, use the reservation method to record the user's address and phone number and agree on a time for supply. At the same time, frequently solicit opinions from fixed users, frequently contact fixed users, and ensure supply.

In addition, expand the wholesale business to private merchants. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, under the leadership of the Industry and Commerce Section, the wholesale store held a forum for department store merchants and peddlers. According to the opinions of private merchants and peddlers, it adjusted the wholesale starting point and increased the variety, striving for them to purchase goods from the wholesale store.

Third, improved labor organization, procedures and systems, and implemented a rotation system. The store has a total of 38 employees, divided into nine groups including accounting statistics, food, and stationery, with each group ranging from two to five people. In business operations, there are phenomena of uneven busy and idle times and the inability of groups to help each other, which affects sales. Now they are divided into five groups: fabrics, stationery, food, and knitwear, and the personnel of the rural teams are assigned to the business groups, which overcomes the phenomenon that the rural personnel do not know the inventory quantity. Now, the number of personnel in each group has increased compared to the past, and mutual assistance between groups has been strengthened. A rotation system has been implemented, and business is open as usual on Sundays, which has increased the amount of sales.

In addition, the store has also made great efforts in simplifying the procedures for requisitioning goods, mastering the inventory situation, and pricing, which has made commodity circulation flexible and accelerated capital turnover.

Although the Suihua County First Department Store Wholesale Store has made great achievements, the supply contracts signed with the cooperatives cannot be fully implemented, the accounts and goods are relatively chaotic, and the organizational structure is unsound. These problems still need to be further improved. (Zhao Yiqing)

　　中国百货公司黑龙江省绥化县第一批发商店
    密切结合合作社季季超额完成商品流转计划
    中国百货公司黑龙江省绥化县公司第一批发商店（下简称绥化县第一百货批发商店）今年第一、二、三季度都超额完成计划，该店全年商品流转计划，占县百货公司总计划的百分之五十。第四季度除保证完成计划外，并以超额完成十五亿二千七百万元作为增产节约计划，截至十月末已完成季度计划的百分之三十。
    这个商店所以能季季超额完成商品流转计划，主要是由于能密切结合合作社，努力运用先进工作法的结果。其具体的做法是：
    一、研究人民的需要，把推销计划建立在合作社推销计划的基础上：这个商店每季度通过合作社推销的推销额平均在百分之八十以上。今年第三季度，在中共绥化县委财经贸易部领导下，由县合作社联合社、国营商业和合作社联合办事处、县批发商店主任等人，在二区新胜村合作社进行了典型调查，具体摸清了各阶层农民在第四季度内购买力情况，并对主要商品的需要数量、时间、规格作了调查。绥化县第一百货批发商店就根据货物的来源，库存数量，村合作社根据自己供应能力、资金情况，双方签订分季分月的供应合同。由县委财经贸易部、县人民政府工商科、县联合社、国营商业和合作社联合办事处督促执行。同时根据农民出售粮食的时间，在数量上确定十月份供应百分之三十五，十一月份供应百分之四十，十二月份供应百分之二十五。然后县委又召开了全县国营商业和合作社物资交流会议，绥化县第一百货批发商店设立了商品展览室，组织各村合作社主任参观，签订全县各村合作社供应合同。这种交流会议，今年每一季度都举行了一次。这样从典型调查到全面签订合同的过程中，不仅能了解农民需要，同时能使产销情况和县合作社联合社计划得到平衡。使批发商店对组织主要商品能够心中有数。
    二、贯彻扩大批发业务进一步扶助合作社的发展：绥化县第一百货批发商店对货源充裕的商品，做到满足合作社、固定用户和私人零售商的要求。对现时数量较少货源一时有困难而消费者又急需的商品，首先满足农村合作社的需要。在分配上先满足有计划的合作社，剩余部分按着每个村合作社的供应范围大小，上次取货时间距现在的长短，确定分配数量。然后运用通讯网告知各村合作社，限信到五天内来取货。这样就能照顾到偏远地区的合作社。同时组织下乡小组，经常携带样品、商品目录向合作社介绍新商品，并帮助打开销路。该店学习凤城百货批发部的经验，建立通讯网。从八月份到现在共发信四百零八封，把每次来货印发商品目录，并注明价格，通知合作社来买。
    绥化县第一百货批发商店除密切结合合作社外，还建立起对固定用户的正常关系。由原有固定用户二十二个单位增加到二十六个单位。对有基础的固定用户建立供应计划，提前提出季月计划，以便及早组织供应。对生产部门的固定用户，每小组有专人负责了解掌握生产需要情况，按时准备物资供应。凡用户需要而库存不足的商品，用预约的办法把用户地址电话号码记下来，约定时间供应。同时经常征求固定用户意见，经常和固定用户联系，保证供应。
    另外，扩大对私商的批发业务，批发商店在四季度初在工商科的领导下，召开了百货业座商、小贩座谈会，根据私商小贩的意见，调整了批发起点，增加了品种，争取他们从批发商店进货。
    三、改进了劳动组织、手续制度，实行了轮休制。这个商店共有工作人员三十八人，分会计统计、食品、文具等九个小组，每组人数从二人至五人不等。在业务经营上有忙闲不匀与组和组间不能互相帮助影响推销的现象。现在分成布匹、文具、食品、针织等五个小组，并把下乡小组人员分配到业务小组中去，克服了下乡人员不知库存数量的现象。现在每组人员比过去增加，又加强了小组互助，实行了轮休制，星期日照常营业，扩大了卖钱额。
    此外，在简化要货手续制度、掌握进销存情况和作价上，该商店也作了很大努力，使商品流转灵活，加速了资金周转。
    绥化县第一百货批发商店虽然已经做出很大成绩，但和合作社签订的供应合同还不能全部执行，账货比较紊乱，组织机构不健全等问题，还有待进一步改进。    （赵义清）
