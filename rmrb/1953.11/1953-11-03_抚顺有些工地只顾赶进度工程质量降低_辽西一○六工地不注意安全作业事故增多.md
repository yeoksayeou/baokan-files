After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, many basic construction sites in Fushun City have focused solely on speeding up progress, neglecting project quality.

The Western Work Area of the Civil Engineering Construction Company, when inspecting project progress recently, only checked the completion of project plans, without inquiring about the quality. Workers at the Wanghua District Department Store construction site of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, in order to finish work quickly, did not comply with operating procedures during the plastering process. Mortar should have been mixed three times, but they only mixed it once with water to get by. This situation did not attract the attention of the leadership, and the construction site radio station continued to call for accelerating progress, without educating workers on violating operating procedures.

Simply focusing on progress naturally leads to more quality accidents. The infirmary project of the Fourth Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration had to redo the foundation immediately after it was poured; some brick walls had through-wall cracks. The cement floors and ceilings of the Wanghua District Department Store and the Electric Power Bureau's projects had many pockmarks and honeycombs, some even exposing the reinforcing steel; many bricklaying projects of the Western Work Area of the Civil Engineering Construction Company of the Fushun Mining Bureau were not level horizontally or vertical, and grouting was incomplete. The bureau's outpatient clinic project, which used to be considered a project with good quality in the whole bureau, has also seen a decline in quality recently due to focusing solely on speeding up progress.

The 106 Construction Site, personally led by the Liaoxi First Engineering Company, has seen rapid progress in the project since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in September, thanks to the high level of labor enthusiasm displayed by all employees. However, at the same time, most workers and cadres, especially leading cadres, have only paid attention to project progress and quality, neglecting the safety of operations. As a result, large and small accidents have been occurring continuously recently. For example, in the first work area, from September 10th to 18th, while digging a three-meter-deep foundation, it was known in advance that there was a danger, but construction worker Li Guoyu only focused on completing the task on time, neglecting safety, and did not add slopes or retaining walls. As a result, the old cement foundation fell down, knocking down worker Wang Chengye, whose left calf was crushed. The continuous occurrence of accidents at the construction site has seriously affected the mood of workers to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. For example, after worker Gao Lifas's leg was crushed, workers Miao Xianyou and others in the same group did not work for half a day.

The reason for the continuous occurrence of accidents is mainly that the company's leadership has a one-sided view of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, focusing only on project progress and neglecting safe operations, and has not deeply educated employees on the correct methods of increasing production and practicing economy. Secondly, the leadership of the First Engineering Company has a bureaucratic style. The leadership remains indifferent to the increasing number of personal injury accidents at the 106 Construction Site and ignores many suggestions from employees to strengthen security work.

### 抚顺有些工地只顾赶进度工程质量降低  辽西一○六工地不注意安全作业事故增多

    抚顺有些工地只顾赶进度工程质量降低
    辽西一○六工地不注意安全作业事故增多
    开展增产节约竞赛以后，抚顺市有不少基本建设工地只顾赶进度，忽视了工程质量。
    土木建筑工程公司西部工区，最近在检查工程情况的时候，只检查工程计划完成的情况，对于质量好坏却不过问。市建筑工程局望花区百货商店工地的工人，为了赶快收工，在抹灰工程中就不遵守操作规程，灰浆本应拌三回，但他们用水只拌一拌就应付过去，而这个情况并未引起领导方面的重视，工地广播站每天还是喊加快进度，对于工人违反操作规程的事情却没有进行教育。
    单纯注意进度，质量事故自然就多起来。有色金属工业管理局第四工程公司医务所工程，基础刚浇完就返工；有的砖墙里外透缝。望花区百货商店和电业局的工程，水泥地面和天棚都出了很多麻面和蜂窝，有的甚至露出了铁筋；抚顺矿务局土木建筑公司西部工区，很多砌砖工程横不平竖不直，灌浆不饱满；该局门诊部工程，过去在全局来说本来是质量较好的工程，但是，最近由于光赶进度质量也降低了。
    辽西第一工程公司亲自负责领导的一○六工地，从九月份开展增产节约竞赛以来，全体职工发挥了高度的劳动热情，工程进展很快。但同时因多数工人和干部、特别是领导干部，只注意工程进度、质量，忽视了作业的安全。因此近来大小事故不断发生。如一工区九月十日到十八日，挖进三公尺深的地基，事前已知道有危险，但施工员李国玉却只顾按期完工，忽视安全，没有加坡度和挡土板，结果旧水泥地基掉下来，将工人王成业打倒，左小腿被砸折。该工地由于事故不断发生，已严重地影响了工人开展增产节约竞赛的情绪，如工人高力发腿被压折后，同组工人苗宪有等半天没有干活。
    造成事故不断发生的原因，主要是该公司领导上，对增产节约竞赛的认识存在着片面观点，只顾工程进度，不顾安全作业，对职工没有深入地进行增产节约的正确方法的教育。其次，是第一工程公司领导上存在着官僚主义作风，一○六工地人身事故不断增加，领导上仍然不闻不问，并对很多职工提出的加强保安工作的建议置之不理。
