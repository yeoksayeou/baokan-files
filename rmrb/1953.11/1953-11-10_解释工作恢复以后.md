    After the Resumption of Explanation Work
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jin
    After the U.S. side obstructed and sabotaged the explanation work, causing it to halt for eleven days, and although it resumed on October 31, U.S. special agents have made more meticulous plans and arrangements for further sabotage.

    The professional liars on the U.S. side have been vigorously spreading rumors, claiming that the suspension of the explanation work was because "prisoners of war refused to listen to explanations," and they slanderously accused our side of deliberately delaying the explanation work. However, when these "figures" felt smug about their activities to sabotage the explanation work, they could not help but reveal the truth. As early as October 20, the Associated Press reported "the opinion of diplomatic circles" that "North Korean prisoners of war have a strong organization, but a single word from the U.S. military in Korea would be enough to make them come out to listen to the Communist explanation."

    Clearly, the reason for the suspension of this explanation work cannot be simply seen as the U.S. side instructing Syngman Rhee's special agents to refuse to allow the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to bring captured personnel of the Korean People's Army out of the camps to listen to explanations according to our plan. What deserves the attention of world opinion is that the main purpose of the U.S. side in creating this incident was to carry out the most tyrannical and unrestrained destruction of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," to inflict a serious blow on the impartial work and prestige of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and to encourage the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents mixed into the camps to pursue the U.S. side's anti-explanation plan of lawless crimes, in order to carry out more meticulous deployments for future sabotage plans.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the murder of volunteer prisoner of war Zhang Zilong by special agents in Camp No. 28 has prominently exposed this serious fact. Because, this incident proves that Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's special agents are using new acts of murder and persecution with greater frequency and cruelty to completely stifle the desire of our captured personnel to return home. Our captured personnel who were not directly repatriated have already suffered extreme torture, murder, tattooing, writing blood letters, reactionary lessons, and other tribulations in the hell on earth U.S. prisoner of war camps such as Jeju Island. Some were forced to join reactionary organizations and dragged into doing bad things, their personalities, dignity, and reason have been seriously damaged, and they are suspicious, fearful, and dare not ask to go home, and some have even been deceived and poisoned. Now, although they have been transferred to camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, they continue to be under the new terror and persecution of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's special agents. Not only do they not know that they have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, but as long as they show a little desire to return home, they are in danger of being tortured and murdered.

    Returning personnel who witnessed Zhang Zilong's brutal murder revealed: The murderers unscrupulously cut Zhang Zilong's flesh, gouged out his heart, cut open his chest, skinned him, and then cooked his heart, lungs, and liver, forcing prisoners of war to eat them. Every prisoner of war in the third company of Camp No. 28 was forced to eat it, and many prisoners of war in the first and second companies were also forced to eat it. In order to prevent prisoners of war from returning home, U.S. special agents even forced people to eat human flesh when they killed people. Under this appalling, savage, and terrifying rule that surpasses the Nazi bandits, aren't the beautiful words of "free choice" from the U.S. side the most shameless lies?

    Although this investigation has exposed the lawless atrocities of U.S. special agents in obstructing and sabotaging the explanation work, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not begun to take the necessary measures to suppress the special agents in the camps under its control, in order to ensure that our captured personnel can gradually eliminate their fears and exercise their right to be repatriated. Therefore, on the night of the investigation, the "regimental commander" of D-zone openly convened a meeting of special agents from various camps in Camp No. 28, sent people to replace the murderers, ordered each "guard member" and "squad leader" to carry a knife, and held large, medium, and small team meetings separately overnight, forcing the prisoners of war to attend a four-hour meeting. When the prisoners of war had just fallen asleep, they were called up one by one and asked: "Do you want to go home? Don't even think about living." In this way, the terrorist rule of the special agents in Camp No. 28 was further strengthened, and the fear of the prisoners of war was further deepened.

    The explanation work in the past few days has also proved that the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agent forces, who are rampant and lawless in the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, are even more arrogant than before, and their sabotage activities against the explanation work are even more unscrupulous.

    Before and after the resumption of the explanation work, Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's bandits and camp special agent messengers frequently communicated. The special agents in various camps nervously forced the prisoners of war to carry out "exercises" to sabotage the explanation work. When our captured personnel in Camp No. 35 listened to the explanation on the first day of the resumption of the explanation work, the special agents forced "unstable elements" to pretend to be "sick," and used this group of "sick" people to exchange special agent elements between camps to go to the explanation tents to make trouble, so that this group of prisoners of war would never have the opportunity to hear the explanation and apply for repatriation. At the same time, the special agents temporarily reorganized the prisoners of war listening to the explanation, and installed secret "informants" and "thugs" to monitor and threaten them. The "battalion commanders" of each camp can also have great freedom and convenience to "observe" near the explanation tents, and send "representatives" to mix into the prisoners of war in other camps to participate in "listening to the explanation" and absorb "experience." After this group of special agent elements returned to their respective camps, they arrested "suspicious elements" overnight, beat them severely, and forced the prisoners of war to write "guarantees" and press blood fingerprints. On the 5th, our side originally proposed to continue to explain to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 28 who had not listened to the explanation, but the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to separately manage the prisoners of war who had listened to the explanation and those who had not listened to the explanation according to the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," so it could not be carried out, and had to change to explaining to a part of the prisoners of war in Camp No. 22. On the 6th, our side designated to continue the explanation work to the remaining prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 who had not listened to the explanation, but they were coerced by special agents not to come out to listen to the explanation, causing the explanation work to be suspended for one day. U.S. special agents are using violence to control and coerce prisoners of war in the camps, and their increasingly rampant sabotage activities have put the entire explanation work in a serious and dangerous situation.

    Our captured personnel under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are suffering from the violent rule of U.S. special agents, their right and freedom to return home have been deprived, and the explanation work is full of obstacles and even impossible to carry out. This is the fundamental and serious problem at present.

    Anyone with ordinary common sense and reason can easily understand that listening to the explanation and the life of prisoners of war in the camps cannot be separated at all. Not directly repatriated prisoners of war should not only listen to the explanation to dispel doubts and apply for repatriation, but after they are transferred to the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, they should no longer be subject to any control or threat, and feel that they have complete freedom to return home and do not have to risk their lives to climb over the barbed wire fence to escape. Obviously, this part of our captured personnel who have suffered long-term磨折, humiliation, and deception, and have serious doubts, if they still live a life of terror in the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and their legitimate desire to return home is still a crime of being tortured and murdered, then it is difficult to imagine that they can all dispel their doubts after hearing a brief explanation and bravely request repatriation.

    Item 3 of the armistice agreement stipulates that each party should release the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated from its military control and hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for handling, so that the prisoners of war have the freedom to exercise their right to be repatriated and no longer be subject to any coercion or violation. The "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" also stipulates that in order to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, it must be guaranteed that "no force or threat of force shall be used to obstruct or force their repatriation," "no violence or insult to their dignity or self-esteem shall be allowed...to prisoners of war"; at the same time, it should be guaranteed that "the country to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience" to explain to the prisoners of war. The "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission specifically guarantee these rights enjoyed by prisoners of war. For example, the "general rules" stipulate that "no prisoner of war shall use violence against other prisoners of war," "any action that violates the rights enjoyed by prisoners of war under the authority of this commission is prohibited," and also stipulates "any behavior that hinders the explanation and visitation work is prohibited," and also stipulates that "prisoners of war can apply for repatriation at any time and any place."

    Doesn't this clearly show that after our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated are transferred to the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has full power to manage the prisoners of war so that the prisoners of war are no longer subject to the violent control and persecution and insults of U.S. special agents? Shouldn't this point, together with guaranteeing that prisoners of war have the opportunity to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, constitute the rights of prisoners of war, and the former is obviously the premise of the latter? Shouldn't prisoners of war have all guarantees so that they can apply for repatriation not only in the explanation tents but also in the camps?

    However, since our captured personnel were transferred from the U.S. prisoner of war camps to the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, these rights that they should have enjoyed have continued to be deprived by U.S. special agents. They have suffered increasingly cruel violent persecution from U.S. special agents, and their dignity and self-esteem have continued to be insulted and destroyed. The vast majority of our captured personnel, who are deeply suspicious, simply dare not believe that they have no rights and freedom in the camps at present, but they can get everything when they get to the explanation tents.

    Moreover, what is the situation with the explanation work itself?

    The U.S. side and the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents under its command fully know that they mainly rely on intensifying bloody terrorist activities in the daily lives of the prisoners of war in the camps to disintegrate and destroy the prisoners of war's desire to return home, and at the same time, they must also try their best to obstruct and sabotage our explanation work.

    It is precisely in order to achieve this sinister purpose that the U.S. special agents' despicable means of directly sabotaging the explanation work are emerging one after another, and the tricks are constantly being renewed.

    After the U.S. side unreasonably delayed the construction time of the explanation tents for up to twenty days, it then instructed special agents to interrupt the explanation work for eleven days. In addition, it is constantly obstructing the explanation work and wasting time. On the other hand, it opposes guaranteeing that the prisoners of war have the actual time of ninety days to receive explanations and visits. In this way, the current explanation work has been considered by the U.S. side to have spent nearly half of it, but the actual explanation time is less than five days. According to the U.S. side's calculations, even if our prisoners of war can fully listen to the explanation within ninety days, and it is carried out simultaneously in thirty-two explanation tents, each prisoner of war can only listen to about one hour of explanation on average. But the U.S. side has continuously persecuted, intimidated, and deceived them for more than two years and has not stopped. But now, the U.S. side wants to further make the actual explanation time a farce that they call "fleeting."

    The more fundamental and serious problem is that the U.S. side's activities of directly obstructing and sabotaging the explanation work have made the provisions of the "scope of authority" and "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work" almost no one that is not frequently and continuously subjected to extremely rude violations and destruction, making it impossible for the vast majority of our captured personnel to exercise their right to be repatriated.

    The U.S. side's control and coercion in obstructing our captured personnel from applying for repatriation extends from the camp to the explanation tents like the tip of a poisonous snake's tongue. Article 9, Paragraph 22 of the "scope of authority" stipulates that "each provision of this agreement shall be made known to all prisoners of war under the custody of the detaining party who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the armistice agreement takes effect," but the letters of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have pointed out that the U.S. side only gave distorted explanations to our captured personnel. When the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission made written and broadcast explanations to our captured personnel under its custody in accordance with this provision and Article 6 of the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," the U.S. side instructed special agents to sabotage it, making it impossible for the prisoners of war to know. Our captured personnel only heard U.S. special agents say that they can only "return to Taiwan" and are not allowed to go home, and cannot be repatriated if one country does not agree, and if they go through the repatriation application door, they will be hacked to death by special agents holding knives at the door. According to the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," when we broadcast to the prisoners of war and give collective explanations, the special agents forced the prisoners of war to plug their ears and shout and shout, making it impossible to listen to the explanation. During individual explanations, our captured personnel who are deeply suspicious have ringing ears, dizziness, spasms, and hysterically shouted, cursed our explanation representatives, and did not dare to stop for a moment in accordance with the set of "exercises" forced by the special agents. Each explanation tent is in a row of sixteen, each tent is only a foot apart, the shouting sounds of the front and rear tents are connected, threatening each other, and the prisoners of war waiting for the explanation are coerced by the special agents to shout loudly in response, making the inside and outside of the explanation tents full of a tense and terrifying atmosphere. Under this situation, the vast majority of our captured personnel have completely lost their rationality, courtesy, self-esteem, and self-control, and are only repeating those simple, stiff, foolish, and vulgar "return to Taiwan" and curses that they know at a glance were taught by the U.S. special agents in a hoarse voice, so that they would not be beaten and smashed to death by the special agents after returning to the camps. As long as an upright person goes to the explanation tent to see this situation, they cannot help but feel indignant at the fact that a normal person who once had a sense of honor has been ruined, trampled, and threatened to such an extent by U.S. special agents.

    Not only that. If a prisoner of war regains his reason and self-esteem and no longer shouts and curses desperately, but tries to listen to the explanation or consider it, the U.S. so-called "detaining party representative," "observing representative," or Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agent elements who impersonate these identities and so-called translators, will immediately disregard any rules and openly interfere and threaten the prisoners of war. This group of demonic figures who have long tortured our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camps, either make gestures, winks, ?嘴示意 to prevent the prisoners of war from requesting repatriation, or use all kinds of despicable means such as sophistry, making trouble unreasonably, beating and scolding people, and threatening to withdraw from the tent to disrupt the explanation work. Our prisoner of war Yue Heidan hesitated for three hours while listening to the explanation and finally requested repatriation, and Hamblen, the head of the U.S. "repatriation" group, publicly protested to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The activities of the U.S. special agents in sabotaging the explanation work are often directed on the spot by their superiors. When the explanation work was carried out on the 4th, Colonel Hansen, the person in charge of the "Psychological Warfare Department" of the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo, who directly directed the terrorist persecution of our captured personnel, personally led a group of special agent leaders to the explanation tents to "observe" the "effect" of sabotaging the explanation work, and wandered around the entrance of the tent applying for repatriation to threaten the prisoners of war listening to the explanation.

    The Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its affiliated agencies (there is an affiliated agency in each explanation tent) not only use the so-called prohibition of the use of force as an excuse to support the U.S. side in obstructing the explanation work, but also unreasonably interfere in the explanation tents from time to time, favoring the U.S. side, making it impossible for our explanation representatives to have full convenience and freedom to carry out the explanation work. For example, in the 20th explanation tent on the 4th alone, the Swiss and Swedish members unreasonably interrupted the explanation as many as seven times, and they also helped the U.S. representatives, saying that our explanation representatives' explanation time for the prisoners of war was "too long," and said that this was "spiritual torture" for the prisoners of war.

    All these facts prove that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not resolutely implement the "scope of authority" and the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," does not disband the special agent organizations, and prohibits the sabotage activities of the special agents, it will not be able to guarantee that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will successfully complete its mission, the repatriation rights of our captured personnel will be completely deprived forever, and the explanation work for the prisoners of war will be in danger of being completely sabotaged at any time.

    Now, only those U.S. rogue hooligan generals and Goebbels-style propagandists, who are politically and morally bankrupt and have nothing left, are shamelessly trying to cover up the U.S. side's criminal activity of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, by specifically fabricating the vulgar words of U.S. special agents coercing prisoners of war to shout and curse in the tents, and recording the number of prisoners of war listening to the explanation who dare not request repatriation every day, to exaggerate the so-called "victory" of the bloody "psychological warfare" they are conducting. At the same time, the U.S. representative to the United Nations is also starting up the voting machine to launch a slander against the Korean-Chinese side for allegedly abusing prisoners of war, and attempting to deny its ironclad crime of bacteriological warfare in Korea, thereby diverting the attention of the people of the world from the U.S. side's bloody activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The U.S. representatives participating in the Panmunjom bilateral talks are also using clumsy tricks every day, trying to bypass the membership issue and make our side accept its unreasonable agenda in order to sabotage the political conference. This series of activities by the U.S. side is not a random coincidence. However, the U.S. side cannot escape its responsibility for obstructing and sabotaging the explanation work and the political conference, and cannot save its complete political and moral bankruptcy. Honest world opinion must continue to be vigilant against all these conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. side and curb them.

    解释工作恢复以后
    本报记者  胡今
    美方阻挠和破坏解释工作，使解释工作停顿了十一天后，虽已于十月三十一日恢复进行，但美方特务已为进一步破坏解释工作作了更周密的计划和布置。
    美方的职业说谎家们曾竭力造谣说，解释工作的停顿是因为“战俘拒绝听解释”，并血口喷人地诬赖我方故意拖延解释工作。但当这些“人物”对破坏解释工作的活动感到得意洋洋的时候，就情不自禁地露出了真相。美联社早在十月二十日就报道 “外交界人士的意见”说，“北朝鲜的战俘有着强有力的组织，但只要有朝鲜的美国军队的一句话，就足以使他们出来听共产党的解释”。
    很显然，使这次解释工作停顿的原因，不能单纯看作是美方指使李承晚特务拒绝中立国遣返委员会根据我方解释计划将朝鲜人民军被俘人员带出营场听解释，值得世界舆论注意的是，美方制造这一事件的主要目的，是要对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”进行一次最横暴最放肆的破坏，使中立国遣返委员会的公正工作及其威信受到一次严重的打击，并鼓励混入营场的蒋李特务奉行美方反解释计划的无法无天的罪行，为今后破坏计划进行更周密的部署。
    中立国遣返委员会对二十八号营场特务谋杀志愿军被俘人员张子龙事件的调查，就突出地暴露了这一严重事实。因为，这一事件证明了蒋李特务正在以更频繁、更残酷的新的谋杀和迫害暴行，来彻底扼杀我方被俘人员的回家愿望。不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，已经在活地狱——济州岛等地美方战俘营中受尽了酷刑、杀害、刺字、写血书、上反动课等等的磨折，有些则被迫加入反动组织，被拖下水去做坏事，他们的人格、尊严和理智已被严重损害，而心存疑惧不敢要求回家，甚至被蒙骗中毒。现在，他们虽然已被移交到中立国遣返委员会看管的营场，但依然继续处在蒋李特务新的恐怖迫害之下，不仅不知道自己有行使被遣返权利的机会，而且只要露出一点要求回家的神色就有受酷刑和被杀害的危险。
    目睹张子龙被惨杀经过的归来人员揭露：凶手肆无忌惮地把张子龙割肉、挖心、剖胸、剥皮，然后煮熟他的心肺肝脏，强迫战俘吃。二十八号营场的三中队每个战俘都被迫吃了，第一、二中队的很多战俘也被迫吃了。为了阻挠战俘回家，美方特务杀人还要强迫人吃人肉。在这种骇人听闻的超过纳粹匪徒的野蛮恐怖统治下，美方所谓“自由选择”的漂亮话，不成了最无耻的谎言吗？
    这次调查虽然已经暴露了美方特务阻挠和破坏解释工作的无法无天的暴行，但中立国遣返委员会并没有开始对其看管下的营场特务采取必要的镇压措施，以保证我方被俘人员得以逐渐消除疑惧，行使其被遣返的权利。因此，调查结束的当天晚上，D—号营区“联队长”就公然在二十八号营场召集各营场特务开会，派人接替凶手的职务，命令每个“警备队员”和“班长”带上小刀，并连夜分头开大、中、小队会议，强迫战俘开了四个钟头的会；当战俘刚刚入睡时，又被一个一个地叫起来问：“你想回家吗？你就别想活了。”这样，二十八号营场特务的恐怖统治更加加强了，战俘的疑惧更加加深了。
    这几天来的解释工作，也证明了在中立国遣返委员会看管下的营场中横行不法的蒋李特务势力比前更加嚣张了，它们对解释工作所进行的破坏活动也更加肆无忌惮了。
    在解释工作恢复前后，蒋李匪帮与营场特务信使频繁。各营场特务紧张地强迫战俘实行破坏解释工作的“演习”。三十五号营场我方被俘人员在解释工作恢复的第一天听解释时，特务强迫“不稳分子”装成“病号”，并在各营场间拿这批“病号”用来调换特务分子到解释帐篷去进行捣乱，使这批战俘永远没有机会听到解释，申请遣返；同时，特务把听解释的战俘临时重新编组，安插秘密“情报员”和“打手”，进行监视和威胁。各营场“大队长”还可以有极大的自由和便利，到解释帐篷附近“观察”，并派“代表”混入其他营场战俘中参加“听解释”，吸取“经验”；这批特务分子回到各营场后就连夜抓起“可疑分子”毒打，强迫战俘写“保证书”，捺血指印。五日，我方原来提出要继续向二十八号营场未听解释的战俘进行解释，但中立国遣返委员会未能根据“解释和访问工作细则”规定把已经听过解释与未经听过解释的战俘分别看管，故无法进行，只得改向二十二号营场一部分战俘解释。六日我方指定继续向未听解释的二十二号营场其余战俘进行解释工作，又被特务胁迫不出来听解释，使解释工作停顿一天。美方特务在营场中以暴力控制和胁迫战俘，进行日益猖狂的破坏活动，已使整个解释工作陷于严重危险的境地了。
    在中立国遣返委员会看管下的我方被俘人员正在受着美方特务的暴力统治，他们回家的权利和自由已被剥夺，解释工作障碍重重甚至根本无法进行，这就是当前的根本的严重问题。
    任何人以普通常识和情理来判断，也不难理解：战俘听解释和他们在营场的生活，是绝对不能分割开来的。不直接遣返的战俘不仅应该听到解释，以解除疑惧，申请遣返；而且当他们被移交中立国遣返委员会看管后就应该不再受到任何控制和威胁，感到自己确实已有回家的完全自由，不必冒死爬铁丝网逃出。很显然，已经长期遭受磨折、凌辱与蒙骗，心存严重疑惧的这一部分我方被俘人员，如果他们在中立国遣返委员会看管下的营场内依然过的是恐怖生活，要求回家的正当愿望依然成了被拷打谋杀的罪名，那末，就很难想像他们都能在听到短促的解释后，就疑惧顿消，勇敢地要求遣返。
    停战协定第三条丑项所以规定各方应将不直接遣返的战俘从其军事控制下释放出来统交中立国遣返委员会处理，就是要使战俘有自由行使其被遣返权利，不再受任何胁迫和侵犯。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”也规定：为了保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利，必须保证对战俘“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强迫其遣返”，“不得允许……对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”；同时，应保证“使战俘所属国家有自由与便利”向战俘进行解释。中立国遣返委员会制定的“解释和访问工作细则”，更是具体地保障了战俘享有的这些权利。例如，“总则”中既规定了“任何战俘不得对其他战俘施以暴力”，“禁止任何侵犯战俘根据本委员会职权范围而享有的权利之行动”，也规定了“禁止战俘任何阻碍解释与访问工作的行为”，同时还规定“战俘可以在任何时间与任何地点申请遣返”。
    这不是明明白白地说明了，不直接遣返的我方被俘人员移交中立国遣返委员会看管后，中立国遣返委员会有完全权力看管战俘，使战俘不再受到美方特务的暴力控制和迫害侮辱吗？这一点，不是应该和保证战俘得有听解释、申请遣返的机会，共同构成战俘的权利，并且前者显然是后者的前提吗？战俘不是应该有一切保证，使他们不仅可以在解释帐篷中申请遣返，而且也可以在营场中申请遣返吗？
    但是，我方被俘人员自从美方战俘营移到中立国遣返委员会看管的营场后，他们应享受到的这些权利，都继续被美方特务剥夺了。他们遭受美方特务越来越残酷的暴力迫害，他们的尊严和自尊继续受到侮辱和摧残。绝大多数的心存疑惧的我方被俘人员，都根本不敢相信，他们目前在营场中既是毫无权利与自由可言，到了解释帐篷却能得到一切。
    何况，就以解释工作本身来说，又是怎么样的情况呢？
    美方和它一手指挥的蒋李特务却是完全知道：他们固然主要依靠在营场的战俘日常生活中来加紧进行血腥的恐怖活动，以瓦解和摧毁战俘的回家愿望，同时也还要千方百计地来阻挠和破坏我方的解释工作。
    正是为了达到这个罪恶目的，美方特务直接破坏解释工作的卑鄙手段，层出不穷，花样翻新。
    美方继无理延搁解释帐篷的修建时间达二十天之后，接着又指使特务阻断解释工作十一天，此外，还无时无刻地不在阻挠解释工作，消耗时间；另一面则反对保证战俘得有九十天接受解释与访问的实际时间。这样，就使得目前的解释工作，被美方认为已快花掉一半了，而实际解释时间却不到五天。根据美方的计算，本来即使我方战俘能在九十天内充分听到解释，在三十二个解释帐篷中同时进行，平均每个战俘也只能听到一小时左右的解释；而美方则已对他们连续进行了两年以上而迄未中止的迫害、恐吓和欺骗。但是，现在美方还要进一步使实际解释时间成为它们所扬言的“瞬息即逝”的儿戏。
    更根本的严重问题还在于美方直接阻挠和破坏解释工作的活动，已使“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的规定几乎没有一条不经常和继续受到极端粗暴的违反和破坏，使绝大多数的我方被俘人员无法行使其被遣返的权利。
    美方阻挠我方被俘人员申请遣返的控制和胁迫，像毒蛇的舌尖一样从营场一直伸展到解释帐篷。“职权范围”第九条第二十二款规定“本协议各条款应在停战协定生效后使在拘留方看管下未行使被遣返权利之全部战俘知晓”，但中立国遣返委员会的函件已指出，美方只是向我方被俘人员进行了歪曲的解释。中立国遣返委员会根据这一规定和“解释和访问工作细则”第六条规定，向其看管下的我方被俘人员用书面和广播进行说明时，美方又指使特务破坏，使战俘无法知道。我方被俘人员只听到美方特务说什么他们只能“回台湾”而不准回家，中立国一国不同意就不能遣返，如果走申请遣返的门就会被在门口持刀相待的特务一刀砍死等等。根据“解释和访问工作细则”规定，我方向战俘广播，进行集体解释时，特务强迫战俘塞住耳朵，敲打叫喊，无法听解释。在进行个别解释时，心存严重疑惧的我方被俘人员一进入解释帐篷，就耳朵震响，头脑昏涨，全身痉挛，歇斯底里地照着特务强迫“演习”的那一套高声吵闹，辱骂我方解释代表，直至声音嘶哑时也不敢停顿片刻。解释帐篷每十六个为一排，每个帐篷相隔咫尺，前后帐篷吵声相连，互相威胁，等待解释的战俘又被特务胁迫高声叫喊，遥相呼应，使解释帐篷内外充满紧张恐怖的气氛。在这种情况下，绝大多数的我方被俘人员都完全失掉了理性、礼貌、自尊和自制力，只是声嘶力竭地重复那几句一听就知道是从美方特务口中传授的简单的生硬的愚顽的下流的“回台湾”和咒语，来使自己不致回到营场后被特务拷打砸死。只要是正直的人到解释帐篷去看看这种情况，就会对一个正常的曾有过荣誉感的人竟被美方特务糟蹋、蹂躏和威胁到如此地步，不能不感到义愤不平。
    不仅这样。如果有战俘恢复理性和自尊，不再拚命吵闹辱骂，而试图倾听解释，或进行考虑时，在解释帐篷中的美方的所谓“拘留一方代表”、“观察代表”，或冒充这些身分和所谓翻译的蒋李特务分子，就立即不顾任何规则，公开进行干涉，威胁战俘。这一群在战俘营中长期磨折我方被俘人员的恶魔人物，不是做手势、使眼色、?嘴示意，阻止战俘要求遣返，就是使用强词夺理、无理取闹、打人骂人、以退出帐篷相要挟等等无所不用其极的卑鄙手段，捣乱解释工作。我方被俘人员岳黑旦因在听解释时迟疑了三小时而最后要求遣返，美方
  “遣返”组组长汉布伦就公然向中立国遣返委员会提出抗议。美方特务破坏解释工作的活动，经常都有他们的上司当场指挥。四日解释工作进行时，直接指挥对我方被俘人员进行恐怖迫害的东京美军总部“心理作战处”负责人汉生上校，就亲自带领一批特务头子到解释帐篷“观察”破坏解释工作的
  “效果”，并在申请遣返的帐篷门口晃来晃去，以威胁听解释的战俘。
    中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构（每一个解释帐篷内都有一个附属机构）的瑞士、瑞典委员，也不仅以所谓不得使用武力为藉口，为美方阻挠解释工作张目，而且在解释帐篷中不时无理地进行干扰，偏袒美方，使我方解释代表不能有充分的便利和自由进行解释工作。如仅在四日那一天内的一个第二十号解释帐篷内，瑞士和瑞典委员就无理阻断解释达七次之多，他们还替美方代表帮腔，说我方解释代表对战俘解释时间“太长”，并说什么这是对战俘的“精神上的磨折”。
    这一切事实证明，中立国遣返委员会如果不坚决执行“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，不打散特务组织，禁止特务的破坏活动，就不能保证中立国遣返委员会顺利完成其任务，我方被俘人员的被遣返权利就将永远被彻底剥夺，对战俘的解释工作也随时有被完全破坏的危险。
    现在，只有在政治上和道义上破产得一无所有的美方流氓恶棍将军们和戈培尔式的宣传家们，才恬不知耻地竭力企图掩盖美方这一强迫扣留战俘的罪恶活动，以专门编造美方特务胁迫战俘在帐篷内叫喊辱骂的下流言语，和记录每天听解释的战俘中有百分之几十不敢要求遣返的数目字，来渲染它们所进行的血淋淋的“心理战”的所谓“胜利”。同时，美国在联合国的代表，也正在开动表决机器发起对朝中方面所谓虐待战俘的毁谤，并妄图抵赖它曾在朝鲜进行的铁案如山的细菌战罪行，借此转移世界人民对美方强迫扣留战俘的血腥活动的注意力。美国参加板门店双方会谈的代表，也每日在使用走马灯式的拙劣的伎俩，企图绕过成员问题，使我方接受其不合理的议程，以便破坏政治会议。美方这一连串的活动，都不是偶然的巧合。然而，美方无论如何也不能逃避其阻挠和破坏解释工作及政治会议的责任，不能挽救其在政治上和道义上的彻底破产。世界正直舆论必须继续对美方这一切阴谋诡计，提高警惕，并加以遏止。
