Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Korea

	"I Want to Testify!"
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jie
	On the morning of November 2nd, during the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's second on-site investigation into the Zhang Zilong murder case, two prisoners of war suddenly ran out from the ranks, one after the other. Their faces were pale, and they looked behind them in fear, afraid that the special agents would rush up and kill them. One of them shouted, "I want to be a witness for the murdered Zhang Zilong!"

	The names of these two prisoners of war were Wang Zhide and He Tianlong. On the night Zhang Zilong was brutally murdered, He Tianlong tossed and turned, unable to sleep. As soon as he closed his eyes, the brutal scene of Zhang Zilong's murder that he had seen during the day appeared before him: Zhang Zilong was hung from a beam inside the tent, his body covered in a bloody pulp, the white bones of both arms exposed, a hole the size of a teacup dug out of his back, filled with dark, clotted blood. These scenes weighed on his heart like a nightmare. "I must avenge Zhang Zilong!" he said to himself in secret. He was afraid that his thoughts would be spoken in his sleep and overheard, so he wrapped his head tightly in the blanket, and the added fear and tension made him sweat all over.

	Wang Zhide had been called in during the day to hear about the "communication" regarding Zhang Zilong being gutted. At that time, the "squad leader" grinned and said, "This is the fate of those who want to return home!" Wang Zhide also witnessed the special agents dividing and eating Zhang Zilong's heart and liver. That night, he was also thinking, "How can I seek justice for Zhang Zilong?" But when he heard the footsteps of the "security team" patrolling outside the tent, his heart painfully constricted.

	On October 29th, Wang Zhide saw several special agents carrying hemp sacks into the kitchen in a panic. A rotten, foul smell emanated from the sacks. At the same time, the "battalion commander" ordered all the leftover leather shoes to be handed over, saying they were for "special purposes." These secretive actions made him very suspicious. He made an excuse to go to the kitchen to get water and saw the special agents piling up chopped-up corpses and broken leather shoes, pouring gasoline on them, and burning them. The burning corpses made hissing noises, and the kitchen was filled with an unbearable stench. He was so frightened that he almost cried out and quickly turned around and slipped out of the kitchen.

	That day, Wang Zhide also heard the "squad leader" say triumphantly, "The Neutral Nations are still going to investigate! Even if they dig through the mountain, they won't find anything!" Special agent Shi Yun, the "Battalion Education Section Chief," stood next to the barbed wire and shouted excitedly towards a nearby camp, "That matter has been taken care of. Tell the regimental commander to rest assured! We guarantee they won't even find a fingernail!" Wang Zhide remembered all of these things, word for word.

	Under the strict rule of the special agents, anyone who tried to escape the camp to expose the truth about Zhang Zilong's brutal murder could become the next Zhang Zilong at any time. Whenever He Tianlong and Wang Zhide thought of this, they would be terrified. They knew that just a few days after Zhang Zilong's death, the number of "security team members" had increased from twenty to forty, and then from forty to sixty. Each "security team member" hid a knife and stick in their coat, standing guard day and night around the barbed wire. The special agents said with sinister smiles every day, "Zhang Zilong is just the first. We can kill thirty or twenty! Anyone who leaks a word will end up like Zhang Zilong!"

	During the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's first investigation on November 1st, they witnessed the special agents sabotaging the investigation and grabbing two prisoners of war who tried to escape the barbed wire and brutally beating them. The special agents also threatened at the time, "We've already eaten human hearts, and this time we won't rip out their hearts. We'll pour gasoline on them and light them up like lanterns!" This also filled Wang Zhide and He Tianlong, who wanted to avenge Zhang Zilong, with doubt and fear. They wondered, "Can I run away?"

	On the night of November 1st, they both spent another restless, sleepless night. The horrific scene of Zhang Zilong's murder and the threats from the special agents flashed through their minds like a revolving lantern. But in the end, they both decided, "We must avenge Zhang Zilong! We must return to the motherland!" He Tianlong even prepared "slogans." He planned to find an opportunity to run out when the Indian troops and representatives of the motherland (he believed that the Chinese reporters participating in the investigation were representatives) came again, and even if he couldn't run away and was caught, he would shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party!" to express his feelings and let the Indians and representatives of the motherland hear him. He was afraid that he would shout these two slogans in his sleep, so he wrapped his head tightly in the blanket and didn't dare to close his eyes all night.

	On November 2nd, the Indian troops surrounded the No. 28 camp, and the prisoners of war were called to pass by the witnesses Huang Lichao and You Xuehe one by one. At that time, special agents were interspersed among the prisoners of war to monitor them. Wang Zhide and He Tianlong felt their legs go weak and their hearts beat wildly. They were afraid that they would be caught by the special agents after asking to testify. But they also thought, "This is the best opportunity." When they walked up to the Indians, they finally made up their minds at the last moment and loudly told the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, "I want to testify!"

	The next morning, Wang Zhide and He Tianlong were brought before the investigators of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to testify. They angrily pointed to seven extremely wicked American special agent criminals and said, "They are the ones who killed him! They are the ones who killed him!" Then, they told the investigators of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission all the facts they had witnessed.

### “我要作证！”

    “我要作证！”
    新华社记者　张结
    在十一月二日上午，中立国遣返委员会对张子龙被惨杀案件进行第二次现场调查时，有两个战俘突然先后从行列中跑出来。他们的脸色苍白，恐惧地望着后面，生怕特务分子会冲上来打死他们。其中一个大声说：“我要给惨死的张子龙作证人！”
    这两个战俘的名字是汪志德和何天隆。在张子龙被惨杀的那天夜里，何天隆翻来覆去怎么睡也睡不着。他一闭上眼睛，白天看到的屠杀张子龙的惨象就出现在他的眼前：张子龙被吊在帐篷内的横梁上，混身血肉模糊，两只手臂都露出了白色的骨头，背上被挖了一个茶盅大小的窟窿，里面满是乌黑色的淤血。这些情景像梦魇一样压住他的心，“要给张子龙报仇啊！”他暗暗地对自己说。他怕心里的话在睡梦中会说出来被人听见，用被子紧紧地裹着头，再加上惊恐和紧张，使他满身大汗。
    汪志德在白天曾被叫去听“传达”张子龙被挖心的事情。当时，“小队长”狞笑着说：“这就是想回国的人的下场！”在特务分子分吃张子龙的心和肝时，汪志德也亲眼看见了。在这天夜里，他也在想：“怎么能替张子龙伸冤呢？”但是，当他听见在帐篷外巡逻的“警备队”的脚步声时，他的心难过地紧缩起来。
    十月二十九日，汪志德看见几个特务慌慌张张地扛着麻袋往伙房里去，麻袋里传出一股腐烂的臭味。同时，“大队长”命令把穿剩的皮鞋统统上缴，说有“特别用途”。这些鬼鬼祟祟的行动使他非常怀疑。他就借口到伙房取水，看见特务正把砍成块的尸体和破皮鞋堆在一起，浇上汽油焚烧。被烧的尸体发出嘶嘶的响声，伙房里充满了难闻的臭味。他吓得几乎惊叫出来，赶紧转身溜出伙房。
    当天，汪志德又听见“小队长”得意洋洋地说：“中立国还要调查呢！就是把山挖透他们也查不出来啦！”特务“大队教育股长”施云站在铁丝网旁边朝向附近的一个营场兴奋地高喊道：“那个事已经办好了，告诉联队长放心吧！保证一个指甲也查不出来！”这些，汪志德都一句一句记在心里。
    在特务分子的严密统治下，谁要逃出营场去揭发张子龙被惨杀的真象，随时都可能变成张子龙第二。每当何天隆和汪志德想到这里，他们就毛骨悚然起来。他们知道，就在张子龙死后不几天，“警备队员”从二十个人增加到四十个人。又从四十个人增加到六十个人，每个“警备队员”的外衣里都藏着刀子和棍子，昼夜在铁丝网的四周站着。特务们每天狞笑着说：“张子龙只是第一个，三十个、二十个都杀得起！谁敢走露一点风声，就要他和张子龙一个样！”
    在十一月一日中立国遣返委员会进行第一次调查时，他们又亲眼看见特务破坏了调查，把两个想逃出铁丝网的战俘抓回来毒打。特务们当时还恫吓说：“我们已经吃过人心，这次不再扒他们的心了，要把他们浇上汽油点天灯！”这也使想替张子龙报仇的汪志德和何天隆的心里怀着疑惧。他们想：“我能不能够跑得出去呢？”
    十一月一日夜里，他们又都度过了一个不安的失眠之夜。张子龙被杀的惨象，特务分子的威吓，像走马灯一样在他们脑子里转来转去。但是，他们最后都决定：“要给张子龙报仇！要回到祖国去！”何天隆还准备了“口号”。他计划在印度部队和祖国代表（他认为参加调查的我方记者是代表）再来时，就找机会跑出去，即使跑不出去被抓住也要高喊“毛主席万岁！”和“共产党万岁！”表示自己的心意，让印度人和祖国代表都听到。他怕在梦中就喊出这两句口号，便紧紧地用被子蒙着头一夜都不敢合眼。
    十一月二日，印度部队包围了第二十八号营场，并且叫战俘一个一个地从证人黄立超与尤学和身旁通过。当时，特务分子分别插在战俘中间监视，汪志德和何天隆觉得两腿发软，心脏狂跳起来，他们害怕会在要求作证之后被特务分子抓住。但是，他们又想：“这是最好的一次机会了。”当走到印度人身边时，他们终于在最后一瞬间下了决心，大声告诉中立国遣返委员会人员说：“我要作证！”
    第二天上午，汪志德和何天隆被带到中立国遣返委员会调查人员面前作证。他们愤怒地指着七个罪大恶极的美方特务凶犯说：“就是他们杀的！就是他们杀的！”接着，他们把自己目睹的全部事实告诉了中立国遣返委员会调查人员。
