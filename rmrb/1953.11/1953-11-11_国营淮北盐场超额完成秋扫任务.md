State-run Huaibei Saltworks Exceeds Autumn Harvesting Task
The state-run Huaibei Saltworks has enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy drive. By October 5th, the entire saltworks had completed 108% of the autumn harvesting task, one month and fifteen days ahead of schedule, exceeding the total output of the previous August, September, and October by 800.08%.

The reasons for the high yield this autumn: Objectively, the weather was sunny and dry; subjectively, it was due to the strengthening of production planning and management. For example, in August, the principle of combining flood prevention with production was implemented, correcting the past deviation of relaxing production for the sake of flood prevention. From late July to early August, the Xintan and Guandong saltworks repaired all tide barriers, low-lying mounds, and breaches in the embankment walls. They concentrated all labor to focus on flood prevention during the flood season and concentrate on production during non-flood periods. In the Tainan saltworks, each team had a clear division of labor: the production team leader and some salt pan workers specialized in production, while the union team leader took the workers to prevent floods. This led to an early start to the autumn harvest, with salt seen everywhere in early August in all saltworks, stations, and teams. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the brine on each salt pan was diluted by rainwater, seriously affecting the progress of the autumn harvest work. However, the salt workers displayed high labor enthusiasm, coming up with ideas everywhere, finding tricks, and using various advanced working methods to sow salt earlier and strive for higher yields. In August, in addition to the intense flood relief work during the flood season, all the remaining time was spent on production.

Combining flood prevention with tide-taking was a very important innovation this year. In the past, tides were never taken during flood prevention. This year, cadres and workers broke this conservative thinking. A few days before the August 15th spring tide, all saltworks and stations drained the fresh water from the large embankments, branch rivers, and low-lying areas, and opened the tide gates, embankment gates, and sluices to wait for the tide. Some saltworks put forward specific methods such as "Careful flood prevention, Bold tide-taking" and "Take the tail of the tide, not the head of the tide." Many vivid model examples appeared in the tide-taking process in various saltworks and stations. For example, Xu Jun, the Party branch secretary of the Third Embankment Station of the Xintan Saltworks, was standing on the sluice gate holding a large flag, directing the salt workers to take the tide when the spring tide surged on August 26th. The salt workers slept on the low-lying mounds waiting to take the tide, and as a result, all fifty-six water storage pools in this station were filled with tide water.

In the in-depth patriotic production increase and economy labor competition, the salt workers fully displayed their attitude as masters of their own affairs and enthusiastically responded to the higher authorities' call to increase the autumn harvesting task. Fu Xiangguan, an old salt pan worker from the Gu Er Embankment of the Tasha Station in the Taipei Saltworks, said: "The people of the whole country need a large amount of edible salt, so we should produce more good salt to ensure supply and increase national wealth." In order to carry out planned production, each team revised its patriotic competition plan. The Guandong and Guanxi saltworks also organized working groups to go deep into the embankments and conducted a production inspection. Around mid-September, in order to offer gifts to the National Day, some teams revised their plans again and also carried out challenge competitions. By late September, the entire saltworks had completed the September plan ahead of schedule. Three stations and twenty-three teams in the Xintan Saltworks had already completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and then set out even more production increase targets.

The entire staff of the saltworks is now further carrying out a production increase and economy competition to complete and over fulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy and increasing income by 89.3 billion yuan in the second half of 1953.

    国营淮北盐场超额完成秋扫任务
    国营淮北盐场增产节约运动已热烈展开。到十月五日止，全场提前一个月零十五天完成了秋扫任务百分之一百零八，超过去年八、九、十三个月总产量的百分之八百点零八。
    今年秋扫高产的原因：在客观上是天时晴旱，在主观上是由于生产计划管理的加强。如在八月份贯彻了防汛与生产相结合的方针，纠正了过去为了防汛而放松生产的偏向。新滩、灌东两场从七月下旬到八月上旬，就把所有挡潮堆、洼地堆和圩墙等处缺口修好，集中所有劳动力，做到了汛期集中防汛，非汛期集中力量搞生产。台南场每个小组都进行明确分工：生产组长和部分领滩工人专门搞生产，工会组长带着工人防汛。这样就使秋扫开扫早，各场、所、小组在八月初普遍见了盐。秋扫开始，各滩上的卤水均被雨水冲淡，严重影响了秋扫工作的进行，但盐工们发挥了高度的劳动热情，到处想点子，找窍门，运用了各种先进工作方法。提早种盐，争取多产。八月份除了汛期进行紧张抢险外，其余的时间全部进行了生产。
    防汛结合拿潮是今年的一项极重要的创造。往年在防汛当中从未拿过潮，今年干部和工人就打破了这个保守思想。八月十五大潮汛的前几天，各场、所都把大圩、支河、洼地里的淡水排出去，把潮门、圩门、闸口开开来，等待拿潮。有的场提出了“防汛细心，拿潮大胆”、“拿潮尾不拿潮头”等具体办法。在拿潮中各场、所都出现了很多生动模范事例。如新滩场三圩所党支部书记许俊，在八月二十六号，正当大潮涌上来的时候，他一个人拿着大旗，站在闸门上指挥盐工拿潮，盐工们都睡在洼地堆上等着拿潮，结果这所五十六份蓄水池都拿上了潮。
    在深入开展爱国增产节约劳动竞赛中，盐工们充分发挥了主人翁的态度，热烈响应了上级增加秋扫任务的号召。台北场塔山所顾二圩老领滩工人伏祥官说：“全国人民需要大量的食盐，我们就应该多产好盐，保证供应得上，增加国家财富。”为了进行有计划的生产，每个小组都修订了爱国竞赛计划。灌东、灌西等场还组织了工作组，深入圩下，进行了一次生产检查。在九月半前后，盐工们为了向国庆节献礼，有些小组又重新修订了计划，并且还进行了挑战竞赛。到九月下旬，全场就提前超额完成了九月份计划。新滩场有三个所，二十三个小组提前超额完成全年生产计划后，又订出了更多的增产目标。
    该场全体职工现在进一步开展增产节约竞赛，为完成和超额完成一九五三年下半年增产节约和增加收入八百九十三亿元而斗争。
