    Manpower Backlog Doubled
    Liu Honghao, Zhang Zhengyi, and eleven other assistant teachers from the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Section of Beijing Geological College wrote: We graduated this summer and were assigned here as assistant teachers. With boundless loyalty to the motherland, we came to this position, ready to exert our greatest strength and act as a screw. However, upon arriving here, we discovered that the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Section has a backlog of double the necessary manpower. The Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Section has one lecturer and fifteen assistant teachers. According to our workload here, eight people would be sufficient, and even those working the most work no more than twenty-four hours per week, while those working the least work only eleven hours per week. This semester, there are a total of 185 students. Although twelve teachers are used for teaching and tutoring, meaning an average of only about fifteen students are tutored by one teacher, there are still four people who are completely redundant: one person is in the laboratory doing sweeping, moving instruments, and odd jobs, two people have been sent to Tsinghua University to temporarily assist with work, and another person has gone to the Mining and Metallurgical College to study. The reason for this phenomenon is that our college never considered whether so many people were really needed when planning personnel, but blindly demanded people under the domination of departmentalism. This phenomenon of manpower backlog should be corrected quickly.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    积压了一倍的人力
    北京地质学院电工教研室刘鸿浩、张正一等十一人来信：我们是今年暑期毕业分配来这里的助教。我们怀着无限忠诚于祖国的心情，来到这个工作岗位，准备发挥自己的最大力量，起一个螺丝钉的作用。但是，到了这里，我们发现电工教研室积压了一倍的人力。电工教研室共有讲师一人，助教十五人。按我们这里的工作量来计算，只需要八个人就足够了，而每人工作最多的每周也不过二十四小时，最少的每周只有十一小时。本学期共有一百八十五位同学，虽然用十二位教师来进行教学辅导，就是说平均一个教师只辅导约十五个学生，但仍有四人完全多余：一人在实验室内做扫地、搬仪表及打杂的工作，二人被派到清华大学去临时帮助工作，另一人去矿冶学院学习。这种现象的所以形成，是由于我院在编制人员的计划时，从未考虑过是否真正需要这许多人，而是在本位主义思想支配下盲目要人。这种积压人力的现象，应该迅速纠正。
