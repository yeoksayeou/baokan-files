    A Han Chinese Cadre Who Learned the Tibetan Language
    Yi Bing
    In early September, I arrived at the Amuquhu tribe of Xiahe County from the Xicang tribe of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Stepping onto the platform of the Sixth District People's Government, I saw a young comrade in the room talking to a lama, and they were speaking entirely in Tibetan. When the young comrade saw someone coming in, he came out and asked me who I was looking for.
    "Looking for Comrade Zhang Guangqing."
    "I am Zhang Guangqing."
    I said, "If I didn't hear your Shaanxi accent, I would really think you were a Tibetan comrade!" He smiled, led me inside, and introduced me to the lama, whose name was Cichengmu, the district head of this district. During the few days I stayed in Amuquhu, I saw Zhang Guangqing and Cichengmu, the deputy district head Jiacang Cichengmu, etc., often studying work together and learning together in the morning. Sometimes, after the meeting at night, the Tibetan and Han cadres in the district sang Tibetan folk songs and danced Tibetan dances, with Cichengmu sitting beside them beating the rhythm. In this remote area, their lives were so harmonious!
    Zhang Guangqing has been in Amuquhu for more than two years. He grew up in Yanchang County, Shaanxi Province, and worked there for a long time. When he was in his hometown, he never thought that he would work in Tibetan-inhabited areas in the future, or that he would speak fluent Tibetan. In 1949, he left his hometown and was assigned to work in Xiahe County, Gansu Province.
    In 1951, the organization sent him to Amuquhu again to serve as the Secretary of the Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Xiahe County. The Sixth District has four large tribes: Amuquhu, Meixi, Xiabagou, and Ala. Between late summer and early autumn, the climate on the Gannan prairie is mild, but once the weather changes, snowflakes often fly in the sky, and sometimes there is a sudden hailstorm. When Zhang Guangqing first came to Amuquhu, he was not used to eating buttered zanba or the ever-changing climate on the plateau. What made him even more troubled was that he and the Tibetan people did not understand each other's language. Whether he went to visit the Tibetan people or the Tibetan people came to him, there was always an interpreter sitting beside him. Once the interpreter left, he and the Tibetan people could only sit face to face, unable to say a word of what was on their minds. When he stayed in the district government, few Tibetan people came to him. When he visited the pastoral areas, the herdsmen knew that people from the People's Government had come, so they all came to see him and asked him questions. When they found out that he could not speak Tibetan, some quietly left. When he talked with the Tibetan people, the interpreter often could not translate accurately, and sometimes even translated the original meaning incorrectly. In this way, he often ran into snags in his work. The winter before last, Tibetan people in the villages of Mudao and Qunqiu had a fight. He brought the representatives of both sides to mediate their dispute, but it happened that the interpreter had gone to Labrang Monastery, so he had to find a Han Chinese who knew a little Tibetan to act as the translator. As a result, many words were not translated, and after the representatives returned, the fight broke out again. Zhang Guangqing's wife, Zhang Bilan, told me that at a meeting of tribal headmen, Zhang Guangqing spoke to them, mentioning the issue of organizing militia. After the meeting, some Tibetan people asked why they had to register their guns. The interpreter translated his words as organizing militia and registering guns, which naturally made the Tibetan people suspicious. After much explanation, they were relieved.
    Under these circumstances, he thought: if he was not used to the life, he could get used to it after a while. If he could not speak or understand Tibetan, how could he communicate the Party's policies to the local masses? How could he carry out his work smoothly if he relied solely on interpreters? How could he take root in this place for a long time? At that time, he had once wanted to leave the Tibetan area. However, the enthusiasm and honesty of the Tibetan people deeply moved him. The Kuomintang bandit gang caused their poverty, and he felt that he must help the Tibetan people get rid of this situation, so he finally overcame the idea of leaving the Tibetan area. However, in order to work here for a long time, he had to eliminate the language barrier first, which made him determined to learn Tibetan.
    In Amuquhu, except for a few Han cadres in the district government, the surroundings were all Tibetan people, which gave him a good environment to learn Tibetan. He asked Cichengmu to help him learn Tibetan. Cichengmu lived with him, and no matter whether it was day or night, as long as he had free time, he would patiently teach him. Cichengmu told Zhang Guangqing to start by learning daily expressions, when those words should be used, and how those words should be pronounced. Zhang Guangqing learned and wrote down, and every time he learned a few sentences, he would talk to the Tibetan people. Sometimes Cichengmu would sit beside him and point out any inaccurate pronunciations or mistakes he made. Sometimes he would learn a few sentences but couldn't use them when talking to the Tibetan people, and he would feel anxious. Cichengmu would comfort him, telling him that learning Tibetan should not be rushed, and even if he couldn't use them today, he would be able to use them someday. With such hard study and memorization, in less than a year, he could talk directly with the Tibetan people. Today, whether he goes to the pasture to visit the herdsmen, or the Tibetan people come to the district government, he not only doesn't bring an interpreter, but he can also serve as an interpreter for those who don't understand Tibetan.
    In that year, he often spoke Tibetan in his dreams and memorized words while walking. Whenever he talked to the Tibetan people and said the wrong words, the Tibetan people would often laugh. However, their laughter did not make Zhang Guangqing feel embarrassed; their laughter was full of friendship and goodwill, because the Han cadre who was talking to them was learning their own language!
    Since Zhang Guangqing mastered this powerful weapon, he often went to the villages and pastures with the cadres in the district to publicize ethnic policies, understand their difficulties and demands, and mediate disputes such as pasture disputes. When he was alone in the district government, the situation was also different from before. The number of Tibetan people coming here increased day by day, and they all felt it convenient to see Zhang Guangqing.
    Yesterday he was not familiar with the Tibetan people, and today he has established a deep friendship with them; yesterday he could only speak Chinese, and today he speaks fluent Tibetan. The key lies in his determination to serve the minority nationalities for a long time.

    记一个学会了藏话的汉族干部
    一兵
    九月初旬，我从甘南藏族自治区的西仓部落到了夏河县的阿木去乎部落。踏上第六区区人民政府的阶台，见到屋子里一个年轻的同志正和一个喇嘛谈话，他们说的全是藏话。那位年轻的同志看到外面来了人，便走出来，问我找谁？
    “找张光清同志。”
    “我就是张光清。”
    我说：“不听到你操的陕北口音，我真以为你是藏族同志啊！”他笑了一笑，引我进去，介绍我和那位喇嘛认识，他名叫慈成木，是这个区的区长。我在阿木去乎停留的几天，看到张光清和慈成木、副区长甲藏慈成木等，经常在一起研究工作，早上一同学习。有时夜里开完了会，区里的藏族干部和汉族干部，唱着藏族民歌，跳着藏族舞，慈成木坐在旁边敲着拍子，在这偏远的地区，他们的生活是多么和谐啊！
    张光清到阿木去乎已经两年多了。他生长在陕北延长县，长期在那里工作，当他在家乡时，从没有想到将来会到藏族聚居地区工作，将来会说一口流利的藏话。一九四九年，他离开家乡，被分派到甘肃省夏河县工作。
    一九五一年，组织上又派他到阿木去乎，担任中共夏河县第六区区委书记。第六区有阿木去乎、梅西、下巴沟和阿拉四个大的部落。夏秋之间，甘南草原气候温和，一旦天气变化，天空往往飘起雪花，有时突然降一阵冰雹。张光清刚来阿木去乎，吃不惯酥油?粑，过不惯高原上变化多端的气候。使他更伤脑筋的，就是他和藏民互不懂话。不管他去访问藏民，或者藏民来找他，身边总是坐着一个译员。译员一走开，他和藏民只有面对面的坐着，满肚子的话一句也说不出来。当他留在区政府，藏民很少来找他。当他访问牧业区，牧民们知道人民政府里的人来了，都来看他，向他问长问短，等到知道他不会说藏话，有的便悄悄地走开了。他和藏民谈话，译员往往译不过来，有时甚至将原意译错了。就这样，他在工作中经常碰钉子。前年冬天，木道和群楚两个村庄的藏民发生械斗。他把双方的代表找来，准备调解他们的纠纷，恰巧译员到拉卜楞去了，只得找一个略懂藏话的汉人充任翻译。结果许多话没有译出来，双方代表回去后，械斗又起来了。张光清的妻子张碧兰告诉我：在一次各部落的头人会议上，张光清向他们讲话，提到组织民兵问题。会后，有些藏民问为什么要登记枪枝？译员将他的话译为要组织民兵，登记枪枝，藏民自然有疑虑。经过多方解释，他们才安下心来。
    在这种情况下，他想：生活过不惯，呆一个时期就可以过惯了。藏话不会说，又听不懂，这怎能将党的政策和当地群众见面呢？光靠译员，怎能顺利地开展工作呢？怎能在这地方长期扎下根子呢？那时，他曾一度想离开藏区。然而，藏族人民的热情、忠厚深深地感动了他。国民党匪帮造成他们的贫困，使他感到必须帮助藏族人民摆脱这样的处境，他终于克服了离开藏区的想法。但是，要想在这里长期工作下去，首先得消除语言上的障碍，这就使他下定了学藏话的决心。
    在阿木去乎，除了区政府有几个汉族干部外，四周都是藏民，使得他的汉话少有施展的地方，这就给予他学藏话一个好的环境。他请求慈成木帮助他学藏话。慈成木和他住在一起，不管白天或晚上，只要有空闲的时间，就耐心地教他。慈成木告诉张光清先从生活上的日常用语学起，那些话在什么场合使用，那些字怎样发音，张光清边学边记，每学会几句，便和藏民交谈。有时慈成木坐在旁边，听到他发音不准确，或说错了的地方，随时指出。有时学会了几句，和藏民谈话运用不过来，他心里发急；慈成木就安慰他，学藏话不可急躁，今天不能运用，总有一天能够搬出来的。在这样苦学苦记下，不到一年，他可以直接和藏民谈话了。今天，不管他去牧场访问牧民，或藏民前来区政府，他不但不带译员，并且可以替不懂藏话的人担任翻译了。
    在这一年里，他经常在梦中说藏话，走路的时候也在默记。每当他和藏民交谈，谈到说错了的字句，藏民往往笑起来。但是，他们的笑，并不使张光清感到难为情；他们的笑，充满了友情和善意，因为和他们交谈的汉族干部，正在学他们自己的话啊！
    张光清自从掌握了这一有力的武器，经常和区里的干部，下到各村庄、各牧场，向他们宣传民族政策，了解他们有些什么困难和要求，给他们调解草场等纠纷。当他一个人留在区政府的时候，情况和从前也不同了，藏民照样地到这里来的一天天增多，他们见了张光清都感到方便。
    昨天还不熟习藏族，今天他和藏民建立了深厚的交情；昨天只会说汉话，今天他操着流利的藏语。它的关键在于下定了为少数民族长期服务的决心。
