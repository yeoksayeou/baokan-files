    Jiuquan Petroleum Drilling Area's Baiwu Type 40 Drilling Rig Team No. 3 Sets New Petroleum Drilling Record
    On October 28th, the Baiwu Type 40 Drilling Rig Team No. 3 of the Jiuquan Petroleum Drilling Area set a new record of drilling 162.39 meters in one day. The team also exceeded its drilling plan for October by 29 percent.
    Since the Baiwu Type 40 Drilling Rig Team No. 3 of the Jiuquan Drilling Area launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy in October, they have continuously implemented the rapid drilling method, which increases the pressure on the drill bit, increases the speed of the rotary table to 250 revolutions per minute, and greatly increases the pump volume of the mud pump. This conforms to the technical principles of rapid drilling of "heavy pressure, fast rotation, and large pump volume." This is the main reason for setting a new record. Secondly, the Soviet Union's newly produced Baiwu Type 40 drilling rig that they used is suitable for rapid drilling, and the jet drill bit used during drilling is also suitable for the geological conditions during drilling.

    酒泉石油钻探区白乌四十型钻机第三队创造石油钻进新纪录
    酒泉石油钻探区白乌四十型钻机第三队，在十月二十八日创造了一天钻进一百六十二点三九公尺的新纪录。该队十月份的钻进计划也已超额百分之二十九完成。
    酒泉钻探区白乌四十型钻机第三队自十月份开展增产节约竞赛后，连续实行了快速钻进法，使钻头的压力增大，转盘的速度开到每分钟二百五十转，同时把泥浆泵的泵量也大大增加，这样就符合“重压、快转、大泵量”的快速钻进的技术原则。这是创造新纪录的主要原因。其次，他们使用的苏联新出产的白乌四十型钻机，是适用于快速钻进的，钻进时使用的喷射式钻头，也适合于钻进时的地层情况。
