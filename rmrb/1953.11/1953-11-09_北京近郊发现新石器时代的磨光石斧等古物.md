    Neolithic Polished Stone Axe and Other Artifacts Discovered Near Beijing

    A large number of ancient tombs were discovered at the construction site of the Qinghezhen State-owned Brick and Tile Factory in the suburbs of Beijing during large-scale soil extraction for brick making. These include Warring States period red pottery urn burials, brick chamber tombs and earthen pit tombs from the Han and Six Dynasties, and brick tombs from the Tang, Liao, Jin, and Ming dynasties.

    During a site survey, personnel from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Relics Investigation Team discovered a polished stone axe from the Neolithic period in the newly excavated, but already moved, soil. During a joint review with personnel from the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they also discovered a large animal bone (still awaiting expert identification). Based on the results of the two surveys, it is speculated that this site may have been a residential site from the Neolithic period, which later became a burial area after the Warring States period.

    This stone axe is at least a production tool from more than three thousand years ago. Its discovery proves that our ancestors were diligently working in what is now the capital more than three thousand years ago.

    北京近郊发现新石器时代的磨光石斧等古物
    北京近郊清河镇国营砖瓦厂在工地大量取土制坯时，发现大片的古墓葬。其中有战国时代的红陶瓮棺葬，汉、六朝的砖室墓及土坑墓，唐、辽、金、明各代的砖墓等。
    北京市人民政府文物调查组人员在踏勘时，在新挖的、但已移动过的土中，发现新石器时代的磨光石斧一件；和中国科学院考古研究所人员共同进行复查时，又发现体格硕大的兽骨（尚待专家鉴定）。根据两次勘查的结果推测，该处可能为新石器时代的居民遗址，自战国后又成为墓葬区。
    这件石斧至少是距今三千多年前的生产工具。它的发现，证明我们的祖先在三千多年以前就在现在的首都地方辛勤地劳动着。
