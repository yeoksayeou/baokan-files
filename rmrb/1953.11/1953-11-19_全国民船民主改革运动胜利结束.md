    The nationwide democratic reform movement of private ships has victoriously concluded. China has a total of 562 main and tributary rivers, with a total length of 110,000 kilometers, of which 21,000 kilometers are navigable by ships, and more than 90,000 kilometers are navigable by wooden sailboats. There are approximately 600,000 private ships in the country, with approximately 3 million boatmen, and a deadweight tonnage of more than 3 million tons. If sea-going private ships are added, it is close to 4 million tons. From the perspective of transportation performance in 1952: private ships accounted for more than 74 percent of the total inland river transportation volume for the year, while ships only accounted for more than 25 percent of the total inland river transportation volume. This shows that although wooden sailboats are a backward means of transportation, they still occupy a considerably important position in China at present and for a period of time to come.
    Before liberation, waterborne counter-revolutionaries colluded with feudal forces. They controlled the supply of goods and exploited boatmen through "yellow ox" shipping firms, exploited boatmen through "broker" organizations, and controlled boatmen's guilds through the "differential ship allocation" method, engaging in blackmail and extortion. After liberation, many remaining land-based counter-revolutionaries sneaked onto the water, colluding with the original feudal bosses on the water to secretly exploit boatmen and boat workers. Therefore, boatmen universally reflected: "Land has land reform, and water should also have water reform."
    In order to meet the demands of boatmen and boat workers, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central Government convened the first National Private Ship Work Conference in December last year, deciding to carry out democratic reform of private ships. Under the unified leadership of local Party committees, a group of key personnel were first drawn to form leading organizations for the democratic reform of private ships at all levels. At the same time, a large number of cadres were dispatched around January this year to start pilot work. They first tried to find sources of goods for the boatmen, solve the boatmen's livelihood problems, and improve the boatmen's enthusiasm, to carry out democratic reform in the active transportation of private ships; on the other hand, they also adopted the method of dividing wharves and fixing ship registrations on the basis of active private ship transportation, thereby carrying out household registration management and understanding the situation. On April 15 this year, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central Government convened the second National Private Ship Democratic Reform Work Conference, summarized the pilot experiences in various places, and deployed a plan for full-scale expansion. By the autumn of this year, democratic reform movements had been launched in private ships across the country one after another. After boatmen and boat workers in various places poured out their grievances, their class consciousness greatly improved. They automatically ran dozens of miles to verify materials, and some even ran hundreds of miles to participate in the struggle. In the movement, examples of wives reporting their husbands and sons reporting their fathers emerged. Due to the active participation of the masses in the movement, the work was smoothly carried out. At present, except for some private ships in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Guangdong, the nationwide democratic reform of private ships has been victoriously concluded.
    After the democratic reform of private ships, the people on the water universally reflected: "Chairman Mao's sun shines on our water," "We will no longer be bullied by bad elements," and "We will no longer spend冤钱." After the democratic reform, the unity between boatmen and boatmen, and between boat workers and boatmen, was strengthened, feudal gang ideologies were greatly weakened, and theft and adulteration were almost eliminated. After the democratic reform, approximately 40 to 60 percent of the boatmen participated in boatmen's associations.
    In addition, during the movement, because some artificial obstacles in transportation were checked and abolished, the burden on the people on the water was greatly reduced. For example, Hunan originally had 31 types of fees, which have now been reduced to 11; Jiangxi originally had 20 types, which have been reduced to 8; and Hubei originally had 27 types, which have been reduced to 7. The entry and exit procedures have also been simplified. For example, private ships in Jiangxi originally had 32 procedures, requiring 8 or 9 agencies, 29 round trips, and 4 or 5 days to complete, but now it only takes 2 or 3 hours, or even 20 minutes to complete; in the past, boatmen in Sichuan had to go through 18 entry and exit procedures, taking 3 or 4 days, and they needed to travel dozens of miles, but now it can be completed in just one hour. Due to the reduction of burdens and the simplification of procedures, the enthusiasm of the boatmen has also been improved. For example, in the past, each boat worker in Sichuan only pulled one ton upstream, but after the reform, they can pull 1.4 tons; in the past, it took 12 to 20 days for a round trip from Chongqing to Hechuan, but now it only takes 8 to 10 days.

    全国民船民主改革运动胜利结束
    全国民船民主改革运动已胜利结束。我国共有五百六十二条干支河流，全长十一万多公里，其中通轮船的有二万一千公里，通木帆船的则达九万余公里。全国共有民船约六十余万只，船民约三百余万人，载重吨位三百余万吨，如加上海上民船，则近四百万吨。从一九五二年运输实绩来看：民船占内河全年运输量百分之七十四强，轮船则仅占内河全年运输量百分之二十五强，由此可见，木帆船虽系一种落后的运输工具，但在我国当前和今后一段时期里，仍居相当重要地位。
    解放前，水上反革命分子与封建势力互相勾结，他们通过黄牛船行，把持货源，剥削船民，通过荐头行等组织，剥削船工，并通过差船摊派方式，把持船帮公所，进行敲诈勒索。解放后很多陆上残余反革命分子潜入水上，勾结水上原有封建把头暗地里仍剥削船民和船工，所以船民普遍反映：“陆上有土改水上也要有水改。”
    为了满足船民和船工的要求，中央交通部于去年十二月间召开全国第一次民船工作会议，决定进行民船民主改革，在各地地方党的统一领导下，首先抽调了一批骨干，组成各级民船民主改革的领导机构，同时派大批干部在今年一月前后，开始试点工作。他们首先设法为船民找货源，解决船民生活问题，提高船民情绪，在活跃民船运输中来进行民主改革；另一面又采取了在活跃民船运输的基础上，进行划分码头，固定船籍，从而进行户口管理与了解情况。今年四月十五日，中央交通部又召开了全国第二次民船民主改革工作会议，总结各地试点经验，并布置了全面展开的计划。到今年秋季全国各地民船都先后展开了民主改革运动，各地船民和船工经过诉苦，阶级觉悟大大提高，他们自动跑几十里路去对证材料，有的甚至跑几百里路来参加斗争，运动中并出现了妻子检举丈夫，儿子检举父亲的范例。由于群众积极参加运动，使工作顺利展开，目前除了皖北、苏北和广东一些民船外，全国民船民主改革工作都已胜利结束。
    民船民主改革后，水上人民普遍反映：“毛主席的太阳照到我们水上来了”，“今后再不受坏分子气了，再不用花冤钱了”。民主改革后，船民与船民之间，船工与船民之间的团结加强了，封建帮派思想大大减弱了，偷盗掺假等行为也几乎绝迹了。民主改革后，约百分之四十至六十的船民都参加了船民协会。
    此外，在运动中因为检查和废除了运输方面的一些人为的障碍，使水上人民负担大为减轻，如湖南原有费目三十一种，现减为十一种；江西原有二十种，已减为八种，湖北原有二十七种减为七种。在出入口手续上也简化了，如江西民船原有三十二道手续，须经八、九个机关，往返二十九次，四、五天还办不完，而现在只要二、三小时，甚至二十分钟即可办完；四川过去船民要办十八道出入口手续，费时三、四天，需要跑几十里路，而现在仅一小时内就可办完。由于负担的减轻和手续的简化，船民的积极性也提高了。如四川过去每个船工上水只拉一吨，改革后能拉一吨四；过去重庆至合川往返需时十二天至二十天，现在只需八天至十天。
