Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 3rd: The "Democratic Korea Daily" published an editorial on the 3rd, titled "As Long as the U.S. Has Sincere Intentions for Consultation, There is No Problem That Cannot Be Solved." The editorial said: The bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue have been held several times, but the talks have made no progress. The editorial pointed out: The five-item agenda proposed by our side in the talks was based on our firm and unwavering position of demanding that the issue of membership be discussed first; our side had repeatedly clarified this in the replies to the U.S. before the talks were even held. This is a proposition recognized as legitimate. However, the U.S. has unreasonably opposed our proposition, stubbornly refusing to discuss the top priority issue—the membership of the political conference—thus preventing the talks from making progress. This stubborn attitude of the U.S. is clearly based on its position of attempting to delay or sabotage the political conference.

The editorial emphasized that the U.S.'s rejection of the participation of neutral Asian countries in the political conference is for the purpose of facilitating the continuation of tensions and even the conspiracy to re-launch the war, which our side absolutely cannot tolerate. If the U.S. truly has the intention and sincerity for consultation, then there will be no problem that cannot be solved.

The editorial concluded: The U.S. must abandon its stubborn, sophistical, slanderous, and threatening attitude and adopt a truly consultative attitude, demonstrating its sincerity towards convening the political conference with practical actions.

Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: TASS, Moscow, November 3rd: "Pravda" diplomatic correspondent P. Yefimov commented on the Panmunjom talks, saying:

The American aggressive bloc, which represents the will of the American arms industry monopoly capitalists, is very interested in maintaining a center of war and international tension in the Far East, and they are stubbornly obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

This policy is manifested in the incidents of the American military authorities in Korea violating the armistice agreement. U.S. aircraft and U.S. patrols often cross the demarcation line and enter the neutral zone and the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In the past three months, there have been one hundred such incidents, some of which even the U.S. itself has had to admit.

The United States has also violated the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the convening of a political conference in Korea. It sent its representative, Dean, to Panmunjom, wanting to delay the convening of the political conference. Even before the talks began, Dean stated categorically at a press conference in Panmunjom that if the Communists refused to change their agenda, the talks would be deadlocked. This shows that the U.S. representative went to Panmunjom with the intention of obstructing the talks.

During the first meeting between the representatives of both sides in Panmunjom on October 26, Dean refused to include the issue of membership of the political conference on the agenda and wanted to limit the talks to discussing the location, date, procedures, and administrative issues related to the convening of the conference. At the same time, the U.S. representative used this discussion to slander the countries of the democratic camp.

Yefimov concluded: The talks between U.S. Representative Dean and the Korean-Chinese representatives in Panmunjom clearly show that the U.S. ruling groups are adopting a policy aimed at obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, just as they did in the past when discussing this issue in the United Nations.

    “民主朝鲜报”和“真理报”外交记者评政治会议双方会谈
    谴责美方玩弄手段拖延召开政治会议
    【新华社平壤三日电】“民主朝鲜报”三日发表社论，题为“只要美方有协商的诚意，就没有解决不了的问题”。社论说：关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈，已经举行了好几次会议，但是会谈没有任何进展。社论指出：我方在会谈中提出的关于五项议程的主张，是根据我方要求首先讨论成员问题的坚定不移的立场而提出的；早在举行会谈之前，我方在给美方的答复通知中已屡次加以阐明。这是被公认为正当的主张。但是，美方却毫无理由地反对我方的主张，固执地拒绝讨论头等重要的问题——政治会议的成员问题，使会谈得不到进展。美方的这种固执态度，显然是根据它企图拖延或破坏政治会议的立场而来的。
    社论着重指出，美方拒绝亚洲中立国参加政治会议的主张，为的是有利于紧张局势的持续、甚至重新发动战争的阴谋，这是我方绝对不能容忍的。美方如果真正具有协商的意愿和诚意，那末便不会有任何解决不了的问题。
    社论最后说：美方必须放弃固执、诡辩、中伤和威胁的态度而采取真正协商的态度，以实际的行动来表示它对于召开政治会议的诚意。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”外交记者普·叶菲莫夫就板门店会谈发表评论说：
    表示美国军火工业垄断资本家意志的美国侵略集团，对于在远东维持一个战争中心与国际紧张局势很感兴趣，他们在顽固地阻挠着和平解决朝鲜问题。
    这种政策表现在朝鲜美国军事当局违反停战协定的事件上。美方飞机和美方巡逻队常常越过分界线，并且进入中立区和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国境。在过去三个月中，这种事件发生过一百起，其中一部分连美方自己也不得不承认。
    美国也违反了停战协定中关于在朝鲜召开政治会议的规定。它派遣了它的代表迪安去板门店，想要拖延政治会议的召开。甚至在会谈还未开始以前，迪安便在板门店记者招待会上断然地说：如果共产党拒绝更改它的议程的话，会谈将会陷于僵局。这便说明美国代表去板门店时就存心要阻挠会谈。
    十月二十六日双方代表在板门店举行第一次会谈，迪安在会上拒绝把政治会议成员问题列入议程，并想使会谈只限于讨论会议的地点、日期、程序以及有关会议召开的行政性问题。同时美国代表利用这次讨论来对民主阵营国家进行诽谤。
    叶菲莫夫最后说：美国代表迪安与朝中代表在板门店进行的会谈，清楚地说明美国统治集团正在采取一种以阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题为目的的政策，就像过去它们在联合国中讨论这个问题时所做的一样。
