The organized mutual aid teams are not immutable. With the continuous improvement of team members' political awareness, the continuous changes in economic conditions, the continuous growth of practical experience in mutual aid and cooperation, and the different production needs of each production season, the mutual aid teams are constantly changing. In the past, we did not conduct good investigation and research on this issue. Therefore, we were alarmed when there were changes in the mutual aid teams, or we regarded some reasonable changes as "collapse." It was also because we did not understand the reasons and essence of the changes in the mutual aid teams, so we used subjectivist methods to rectify the mutual aid teams, demanding "no change" and "maintain the status quo as much as possible," which led the mutual aid and cooperation movement onto a path that should not have been taken. This approach must be changed.

From the understanding of Alai Village in the Sixth District of Tongchuan County, Shaanxi: there are a total of ninety-five households in the village; six mutual aid teams were organized in the spring of 1951, with forty-seven households participating; now there are sixteen mutual aid teams in the village, with sixty-five households participating (two households working together are not counted). In the two years since the organization, the changes in the mutual aid teams have been relatively large: a total of eighteen households changed from individual farmers to mutual aid team members, fourteen households changed from mutual aid team members to individual farming, a total of ten households changed from mutual aid team members to two households working together, and one household changed from individual farming to working together. There are now seventeen households in the village farming individually. Among them, ten households have relatively sufficient labor, livestock, and farm implements, and there are currently no difficulties in production, so the demand for organization is not urgent. Judging from the situation in this village, although the changes in the mutual aid teams are great, the number of individual farming households is always decreasing, and the mutual aid teams are gradually developing. Looking at it from the perspective of a single team: Tao Yingchun's mutual aid team in the village was organized in the spring of 1951 by thirteen households living close to each other. By the spring of 1952, four households including Tao Zhenrong felt that the team was too large and inconvenient for cultivation, so they withdrew and formed another team. The remaining nine households also divided into two groups for harvesting during this year's wheat harvest. After the wheat harvest, the two groups no longer merged. Such changes are the most numerous and common in Tongchuan County. There are also many cases where team members withdraw from this team and jump to that team. This is the inevitable result of blindly forming large teams from door to door at the beginning of the organization, deviating from reality and violating the masses' voluntariness; it is not unreasonable for the masses to do so.

In the past, in leading the work of mutual aid teams, we did not face up to this change, did not find out the essence of the change in the mutual aid teams, but started from subjective wishes and used the method of "cleaning up the old stalls" to rectify the mutual aid teams, and the result was not feasible. For example, in the Sun Zhenmin mutual aid team in Sunjia'ao Village, Fourth District of Tongchuan, the original team members were dissatisfied with the team leader Zhao Qizhong and did not want to help each other with him. Zhao Qizhong himself was also unwilling to be the team leader and asked to withdraw from the team. Our cadres always hoped to solve the problem through everyone's criticism of the team leader and the team leader's self-criticism to everyone; however, after criticism and self-criticism, they still could not get along. Later, the team leader was re-elected, and Zhao Qizhong also withdrew from the team, and the team members' opinions disappeared. (Note: In general, problems in the leadership of mutual aid teams can be solved through team members' criticism and the team leader's sincere self-criticism, but it is impossible to mechanically apply this without considering the circumstances.) Another example is Shangyayucun Village in the Fourth Township of the district. The five mutual aid teams were initially formed by the large team leader according to households; although they have undergone several rectifications in the middle, they have been maintained as they were without allowing the masses to combine voluntarily. As a result, despite the rectifications, the masses still did their own work.

Another common problem in our leadership of mutual aid team work is that regardless of the development and improvement of the mutual aid teams, we believe that the mutual aid teams must have plans and systems, and that the use of work points is good, otherwise it will not work. Gao Jingxiang's temporary mutual aid team in Nuopo Village, Sixth Township of the Fourth District, has no one who can read, keeps track of accounts in their heads, and exchanges labor for labor. The team members generally exchange labor of equal value, and the team members have no objection. However, our cadres regarded it as a "meaningless" team and insisted on using work points. The team did not want to, and the cadres did not agree. Li Guihua's mutual aid team in Shangdian Village, Second Township, did not use work points, and the cadres printed work points and distributed them to them, but they were never used. Some people said: "Mutual aid teams dare not let cadres interfere." This reflection powerfully criticizes the subjectivism of some of our cadres.

It is right for our cadres to attach importance to, actively lead, strive to reduce withdrawals from the team and reduce differentiation, and make it continuously consolidated and developed, when problems occur in the mutual aid team, but we must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, find out the essence of the problem, prescribe the right medicine, and avoid acting blindly. Especially for temporary seasonal mutual aid teams, we must never force uniformity with a fixed form, or hope that farmers will never change after they are organized. Many of the mutual aid teams organized in Tongchuan County in the spring of 1951 were not based on the voluntary participation of the masses, and the teams were also formed too large all at once. (Of course, if conditions permit, they can also be formed larger.) These teams were indeed very enthusiastic in the spring and summer of that year, as if there were no objections. But this does not mean that it was done right at the time. At that time, the masses just believed that what the Communist Party said would not be wrong, and they did not have a real sense of awareness or experience in mutual aid and cooperation. By autumn, especially in the spring of 1952, the masses had some practical experience after a period of mutual aid, and their awareness gradually improved, and they would inevitably break through the circles we had originally drawn and gradually change the chaotic state caused by the original blind grouping. This change is reasonable. We must actively lead, combine with the production tasks of each period, and conduct further research on the changes, laws, and essence of the mutual aid teams, so that the mutual aid and cooperation movement can continuously develop and improve in the correct direction.

    不要害怕群众突破我们划定的圈子
    中共铜川县委书记　梁国兴
    组织起来的互助组并不是一成不变的。随着组员政治觉悟的不断提高、经济条件的不断变化、互助合作实际经验的不断增长和各个生产季节的生产需要不同，互助组在不断地变化着。我们以往对这个问题没有很好地调查研究，因此，看到互助组内一有了变化就大惊小怪起来，或是把一些合理的变化看成了“垮台”。也正因为没有摸清互助组变化的原因和实质，于是用主观主义的办法去整顿互助组，要求“原封不动”、“尽量维持现状”，使互助合作运动走了不应走的弯路。这种作法必须加以改变。
    从陕西铜川县六区阿来村了解：全村共有九十五户；一九五一年春季组织了六个互助组，参加的有四十七户；现在该村有十六个互助组，参加的有六十五户（两户在一起搭工的未计算在内）。组织起来以后两年多，互助组的变化是比较大的：由单干农民变成互助组员的共十八户，由互助组员变成单干的十四户，由互助组员变为两户搭工的共十户，由单干户变成搭工的一户。现在全村有十七户单干的。其中有十户都是劳力畜力农具比较充裕，目前生产上没有什么困难的，因而组织起来的要求也不迫切。从这村的情况看，尽管互助组变化很大，但是单干户总是越变越少，互助组是在逐步发展着。再从一个组看：该村陶迎春互助组，是一九五一年春季由住得靠近的十三户挨门编起来的。到一九五二年春，陶振荣等四户嫌组大、耕作不便，退出去另编一个组。其余的九户在今年收麦时也划成两个小组收割。麦收后，两个小组就不再合拢了。像这样的变化，在铜川全县是最多最普遍的。组员退出这个组跳到那个组去的情况也不少。这是开始组织时很多是挨门挨户编组、脱离实际盲目编大组、违反群众自愿的必然的结果；群众这样做并不是不合理的。
    我们过去在领导互助组的工作中，并没有正视这种变化，没有找出互助组变化的实质，而是从主观愿望出发，用“收拾旧摊子”的办法去整顿互助组，结果是行不通。如铜川四区孙家坳村孙振民互助组，原来组员对组长赵启中不满，不愿和他互助，赵启中本人也不愿当组长，要求退组。我们干部总是希望经过大家对组长的批评和组长向大家作检讨来解决问题；可是，批评了，检讨了，还是弄不到一块。后来改选了组长，赵启中也退出了组，组员们的意见才没有了。（按：一般互助组领导上的问题，经过组员批评，组长诚恳的检讨，是可以解决的，但是不能不分情况机械地硬套。）又如该区四乡上?峪村，五个互助组，开始是由大组长一手按户划编起来的；中间虽经过几次整顿，但都是原封不动地保持下来，没有让群众根据自愿来结合。结果是：整顿尽管整顿，群众仍然各干各的活。
    我们在领导互助组工作中，比较普遍存在的另一毛病是不管互助组发展和提高的程度，认为互助组一定要有计划、有制度，使用工票就好，否则就不行。四区六乡挪坡村高景祥临时互助组，没有一人识字，记的是肚子账，工顶工，组内大体是等价交换的，组员都没有意见。可是，却被我们干部看成是个“没意思”的组，硬叫他们用工票。组里不愿意，干部还不答应。二乡上店村李桂花互助组不使用工票，干部印好工票发给他们，一直也没使用。有些群众说：“互助组不敢叫干部插手。”这个反映，正有力地批评了我们某些干部的主观主义。
    互助组里发生了问题，我们干部重视、积极领导、争取少退组、少分化，使它不断巩固、发展，这是对的，但是必须虚心地听取群众的意见，弄清问题的实质，对症下药，避免盲目从事。尤其是对临时季节性的互助组，绝不能用一种固定的形式去强求一律，或是希望农民组织起来后永不变化。铜川全县一九五一年春季组织起来的互助组中，有很多不是出于群众自愿的，并且组也一下子办得太大了。（当然有条件的，也可以办得大些。）这些组在当年春夏两季的确也很热火，好像没有什么意见似的。但这并不能说明当时就搞对了。当时群众只是相信共产党的话不会有错，对于互助合作还没有真正的自觉，也没有经验。到了秋季，特别是一九五二年春季，群众经过一个时期互助，有了一些实际经验，觉悟也逐步提高了，也就必然会突破我们原来划定的圈子，逐渐改变原来盲目编组造成的混乱状态。这种变化是合理的。我们必须积极加以领导，结合各个时期的生产任务，对互助组变化的情况、规律以及变化的实质，作进一步的研究，使互助合作运动循着正确的方向不断发展和提高。
