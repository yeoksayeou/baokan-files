    Tangshan Steel Plant Completes October Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Creates Advanced Converter Operation Method, Successfully Enlarges Converter Furnace
    A tense and enthusiastic production increase and economy drive is underway among the workers of the Tangshan Steel Plant. They are combining the path taken by the Soviet Union after the October Revolution with the current production increase and economy movement in our country, like a brilliant ray of sunshine illuminating the path taken by the Chinese people, which has generated immeasurable inspiring force for them. Thanks to the competition launched under the slogan of welcoming the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Tangshan Steel Plant completed the state production plan for October two days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan for the entire month and increasing steel ingot production by 913 tons. The competition is still continuing. All the workers of the plant are fighting to complete the state production plan for the entire year ahead of schedule.
    Furthermore: In October, two innovations in Tangshan by Cai Liancheng, an advanced worker at the Tangshan Steel Plant, and Zhao Naibin, director of the steelmaking department of the steel plant, during the production increase and economy drive, caused a sensation in this industrial city.
    Cai Liancheng, a steelmaking worker and member of the Communist Youth League at the Tangshan Steel Plant, created an advanced converter operation method during the production increase and economy drive. The characteristic of this operation method is that during the second stage of converter blowing, the blowing is first done deep below the surface of the molten iron, and then shallow blowing is done from the surface of the molten iron. This reduces the amount of molten iron splashing out of the furnace, greatly reduces the consumption of pig iron, saves ferromanganese, and increases the steel output. After this operation method was promoted throughout the plant, it can create 13.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country annually. Cai Liancheng received strong support from the Party committee and cooperation from engineering and technical personnel in the process of creating this advanced operation method.
    At the same time as Cai Liancheng's advanced converter operation method, Zhao Naibin, director of the steelmaking department of the Tangshan Steel Plant, cooperated with technicians and workers to successfully enlarge the converter furnace. They removed the fire clay from the furnace lining and replaced it with asbestos board, increasing the converter capacity by 15 percent compared to the original. In order to adapt to the enlargement of the converter furnace, they also carried out a series of improvements to the base plate, molten iron ladle, and iron melting furnace. As a result of enlarging the furnace and improving the equipment, the total output value increased by 41.6 billion yuan annually.
    In order to celebrate the innovations of Cai Liancheng and Zhao Naibin, the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions and the Tangshan People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a radio broadcast meeting throughout the city on October 17, and read out a joint congratulatory letter from the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. The Tangshan Steel Plant also received a congratulatory letter from the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. (Bai Yuan)

    唐山钢厂提前完成十月份生产计划
    创造了转炉的先进操作方法，扩大转炉炉膛获得成功
    增产节约竞赛正在唐山钢厂的职工中紧张热烈地进行着。他们把十月革命后苏联所走的道路和我们国家目前所进行的增产节约运动结合起来，好像一道灿烂的照亮着中国人民所走的道路的阳光，对他们发生了无限的鼓舞的力量。由于在迎接十月社会主义革命三十六周年的口号下所发动的竞赛，使唐山钢厂全厂提前两天完成了十月份的国家生产计划，全月超过计划，增产钢锭九百一十三吨。现在竞赛仍在继续着。全厂职工正在为提前完成全年的国家生产计划而斗争。
    又讯：十月里，在唐山，由于唐山钢厂先进工人蔡连成及钢厂炼钢部主任赵乃斌在增产节约运动中的两个创举，轰动了这个工业城市。
    唐山钢厂炼钢工人——青年团员蔡连成，在增产节约运动中，创造了转炉的先进操作方法。这个操作方法的特点是在转炉吹炼第二期的时候，先在铁水表面下深吹，然后再从铁水的表面浅吹。这样就能使铁水往炉外喷溅得少，大大减少了生铁的消耗，同时也节省了锰铁，增加了出钢量。这个操作方法在全厂推广后，全年可给国家创造一百三十七亿元的财富。蔡连成在创造这个先进操作方法的过程中，曾得到党委的大力支持和工程技术人员的合作。
    和蔡连成所创造的转炉先进操作方法同时，唐山钢厂炼钢部主任赵乃斌和技术人员、工人合作，扩大转炉炉膛获得成功。他们把炉膛里的火泥去掉，用石绵板来代替，使转炉容量比原来扩大了百分之十五。为了适应转炉炉膛的扩大，他们还进行了底板、铁水包、化铁炉等一系列的改进工作。由于扩大炉膛、改进设备的结果，每年增产的总产值达四百一十六亿元。
    为了庆贺蔡连成、赵乃斌的创举，唐山市工会联合会和唐山市人民广播电台于十月十七日在全市联合举行广播大会，并在大会上宣读了中共唐山市委会、市人民政府、市工会联合会及青年团唐山市委会的联合贺函。唐山钢厂同时收到河北省工会联合会寄来的贺函。（白原）
