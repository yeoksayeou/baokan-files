Reader's Letters Summary:

    Laboring Woman Tan Chunhua Elected as Deputy County Head of Yugan County
    Readers Yang Shilang, Tang Bingji, and Xiong Zhuoran write: Tan Chunhua, a laboring woman from Sanmen Han Village in Yugan County, Jiangxi Province, was honorably elected as Deputy County Head at the Yugan County People's Representatives Conference last December.

    Before liberation, Yugan County often suffered from devastating floods. When Chunhua was three years old, her father died, and the rice seedlings in the fields were submerged by floods. Coupled with the grain requisition and tax extortion by the Kuomintang reactionaries, her mother had no choice but to take her to beg for food. At the age of five, she was forced to work in the county's Catholic Church, fanning for the priests. Later, she wandered around, surviving on grass roots and tree bark.

    After liberation in 1949, the People's Government called on the local people to prevent floods and repair dikes to protect farmland. Chunhua took up a hoe and joined the men in repairing the dikes. At that time, some people with backward ideas believed that "women on the dikes were unlucky." Chunhua resolutely fought against such superstitious ideas and mobilized more than eighty women to participate in dike repair, going from house to house. Soon, many women in the whole district were mobilized. Chunhua often educated the women that they must work hard to be emancipated, and she took the lead in working from dawn to dusk. Under her educational influence, the women's enthusiasm grew, and they were able to overfulfill the tasks assigned to them. In February and March 1951, as the flood season approached, Chunhua led the women to help rush-repair the unfinished dike works. One day, it rained heavily, and the river water rose sharply. Many people shouted to go back, but Chunhua thought that although repairing the dikes now was hard, it was hundreds of times better than rescuing after the dikes broke. Therefore, she resolutely led everyone to persist in working in the heavy rain and launched a competition. In this way, all the unfinished work was successfully completed in more than twenty days. Chunhua was therefore named a special-class labor model in the county.

    During the land reform, Chunhua actively mobilized the masses and resolutely struggled against landlords and local bullies. During disaster relief and drought resistance, she also mobilized women to respond to the government's call, overcome disasters, and strive for a good harvest. Because of her consistent active work, she was elected as the Deputy Director of the District Democratic Women's Federation, and soon after, she was appointed as the Deputy District Head. Later, she was transferred to the CCP Fuliang Prefectural Committee Cadre School for study. Last September, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In December, when Yugan County held a People's Representatives Conference, Tan Chunhua was supported and loved by the people and was elected as the Deputy County Head of Yugan County.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    劳动妇女谭春花当选为余干县副县长
    读者杨石朗、唐炳积、熊卓然来信：江西省馀干县三门汉村劳动妇女谭春花，去年十二月在县各界人民代表会议上光荣地被选为副县长。
    解放前，馀干县经常洪水泛滥成灾。春花三岁时，父亲死了，田里的禾苗又被洪水淹没，加上国民党反动派的催粮逼税，逼得她母亲只好带着她去讨饭。五岁时她被逼到县里的天主堂替神甫打扇。后来她又到处流浪，吃草根树皮度日。
    一九四九年解放后，人民政府号召当地人民防治洪水，修堤保田。春花扛起锄头和男人一起参加修堤。当时，一部分思想落后的人们认为“女人上堤不吉利”。春花坚决和那种迷信思想作斗争，并且挨家逐户地动员了八十多个妇女参加修堤。不久，全区很多妇女都动员起来了。春花常对妇女们进行翻身就得劳动的教育，自己起早摸黑地带头干活。在她的教育影响下，妇女们的劲头愈来愈大，分给她们的工作都能超额完成。一九五一年二、三月间，眼看洪水季节迫近了，春花带领着妇女们帮助抢修未完的堤工。一天，大雨倾盆，河水猛涨，不少人都嚷着要回去，春花想到现在修堤虽然艰苦，但总比决了堤才抢救要好几百倍。于是，她坚决带动大家在大雨中坚持工作，掀起竞赛。这样，所有未完成的工作，在二十多天内就胜利完工了。春花因此被评为全县特等劳动模范。
    土地改革中，春花曾积极发动群众，坚决和地主恶霸斗争。救灾抗旱时，她也发动妇女响应政府号召，战胜灾荒，争取了丰收。她因工作一贯积极，被选为区民主妇女联合会副主任，不久，又被任为副区长。后来，她被调到中共浮梁地委干部学校学习。去年九月，她光荣地加入了中国共产党。十二月，馀干县召开各界人民代表会议时，谭春花受到人民的拥护与爱戴，被选为馀干县的副县长。
