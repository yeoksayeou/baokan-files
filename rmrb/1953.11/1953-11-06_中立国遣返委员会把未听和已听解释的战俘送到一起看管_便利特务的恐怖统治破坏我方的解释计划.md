    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th – The Korean-Chinese side originally planned to continue explanations to Chinese People’s Volunteer Army prisoners of war (POWs) in Camp 28 on the 5th, as there were still more than 200 POWs in this camp who had not heard the explanations on the 4th. However, these 200+ unexplained POWs were sent back to their original camp together with nearly 200 POWs who had already received explanations on the 4th, making it impossible to distinguish them from those who had already been explained to. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese side had to change to explaining to Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs in Camp C22 on the 5th.
    Sending unexplained POWs and already explained POWs back to the original camp together is a violation of the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Interview Work" stipulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Article 20 of the "Rules of Procedure" stipulates: "Prisoners of war applying for repatriation, prisoners of war who have undergone explanation in accordance with Article 7 of these Rules of Procedure but have not yet applied for repatriation, and prisoners of war who have not yet undergone explanation and have not yet applied for repatriation shall be kept separately."
    Since the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents are currently openly controlling the POWs, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission particularly needs to work according to this provision. The Rhee-Chiang special agents had ordered the POWs to tear up their POW cards and ordered them to refuse to give their names when handing them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. Therefore, if the explained and unexplained POWs are sent back to the original camp together, the Rhee-Chiang special agents can boldly impersonate unexplained POWs to come out to listen to the explanations, continue to sabotage and disrupt the explanation work, and prevent the POWs who request repatriation from ever having the opportunity to hear the explanations.

    中立国遣返委员会把未听和已听解释的战俘送到一起看管
    便利特务的恐怖统治破坏我方的解释计划
    【新华社开城五日电】朝中方面原定在五日继续向第二十八号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释，因为在四日的解释工作中，这个营场中还有二百多名战俘没有听到解释。但是，这二百多名未经解释的战俘，竟在四日和已经解释过的将近二百名战俘被一起送回原来的营场，以致无法把他们和那些已经解释过的战俘区别出来。因此，朝中方面在五日不得不改为对C二十二号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。
    未经解释的战俘和已经解释过的战俘一起被送回原来的营场，这是违反中立国遣返委员会所规定的“解释和访问工作细则”的。“工作细则”第二十款规定：“申请遣返之战俘，按照本工作细则第七款经过解释但尚未提出申请遣返之战俘，以及尚未经解释又未提出申请遣返之战俘，应予分别看管。”
    由于李承晚和蒋介石匪帮特务目前公开地控制着战俘，中立国遣返委员会特别需要根据这一项规定来进行工作。李、蒋特务曾经命令战俘撕掉他们的战俘卡片，并且命令他们在移交给中立国遣返委员会看管时拒绝说出他们的名字。因此，如果将已经解释过的和未经解释的战俘一起送回原营场，李、蒋特务就可以大胆地冒充未经解释的战俘出来听取解释，继续对解释工作进行破坏和捣乱，并且使要求遣返的战俘永远得不到听取解释的机会。
