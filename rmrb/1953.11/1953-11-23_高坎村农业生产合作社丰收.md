Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative's Bumper Harvest
By our reporter Fang Qing

Off to Gaokan Village

Leaving Shenyang and heading east, when you can already see the plumes of smoke from the coal city of Fushun, Gaokan Village is right before your eyes. Batch after batch of trucks transport vegetables from here. Tractors are noisily plowing the fields. In the village, more than a dozen people are happily gathered around a rapidly spinning thresher, busily working. Although dust and shredded bean leaves fly everywhere, it doesn't stop people from laughing and talking with their mouths wide open. Here are piles of corn cobs more than a foot long, and there are mountains of red sorghum – no matter which way you look, it's a scene of a bumper harvest.

Yes, the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This is a simplified statement of account for the distribution of production results: the entire cooperative has fifty-eight households, three hundred and twenty-nine people, and nine hundred and forty-seven mu of land (1,000 square meters per mu). The total value of agricultural and sideline production is converted into 1.13 million jin of standard grain (using corn as the standard grain; the number of jin under a thousand is rounded off).

After deducting agricultural tax, public accumulation fund, next year's seeds, fodder, and this year's land rent, cooperative member investment interest, production expenses, management fees, etc. from the total output, each work day is allocated 40 jin of standard grain, more than 63% higher than the 24.5 jin of grain allocated per work day last year. If the land rent and investment interest earned by cooperative members are added together, and divided by the total population of the cooperative, the average income per person is 1,919 jin.

Looking back at the old society's Gaokan Village – the landlords, accounting for 8% of the population, owned 90.7% of the land. The highest annual output averaged only 370 jin of grain per mu. After liberation in 1948, land reform was implemented, the landlords' land was confiscated, and under the leadership of the Party, the peasants organized mutual aid teams, which developed into agricultural production cooperatives last year. This year, thanks to improved management and agricultural techniques, an average harvest of 767 jin of grain per mu was achieved.

New Experience Plus Tractor

In January of this year, Zhang Zhenfa, director of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative, visited Zhaoyuan and brought back Ren Guodong's leadership methods and high-yield experience to the cooperative. After this, a symposium was held in the district, inviting two veteran farmers from this cooperative to participate and study how to promote the Zhaoyuan farming method locally. One of the veteran farmers, Zhao Hengyu, summarized the Zhaoyuan farming method into two words: dense and even. In 1949, Liu Hailin's family planted corn. The women used to dibble the seedlings. Seeing that the men planted one seedling per step, she also planted one seedling per step. She forgot that the men's steps were large, two and a half chi per step, while her steps were only two chi, so the number of plants she planted was 20% more than others. When the autumn harvest came, she saw that the corn cobs she planted were not small at all, so she harvested 20% more corn than other families. This fact just confirmed the Zhaoyuan experience. In this way, everyone's thinking slowly became consistent, and finally it was decided: corn should be planted at a distance of 1.8 chi, and the width of the ridge should also be reduced by two cun compared to before. The number of plants per mu was increased from the previous 2,000 to more than 2,900, which is the main reason for this year's average yield of 700 jin of natural grain per mu of corn.

When Zhang Zhenfa introduced the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, he said that when planting millet, the ridges should be wide and the seedlings should be sparse, leaving two rows of seedlings on one ridge, staggered like "dog bite marks." Based on this experience, agricultural technician Lü Shanxiang thought in front of the sowing machine: The Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is good and has given us great inspiration; but they are using old farm tools. Since we have new horse-drawn farm tools, we should take it a step further on the existing basis. Finally, he combined the "trench openers" on the sowing machine, measured it with a ruler, and came up with a method of sowing three rows of seedlings on one ridge, with a ridge width of 4.5 cun, one seedling every 1.5 to 2 cun, staggered to leave "crooked seedlings." The result of this sowing and thinning increased the number of plants per mu from Zhaoyuan's 40,000 to more than 53,000. An average of 650 jin was harvested per mu.

The cooperative members strongly supported using a sowing machine to plant wheat, but disagreed with using it to plant soybeans. The reason was that 20% of the soybeans planted with the sowing machine last year did not emerge, the plants were small, and the pods grew close to the soil. The masses said, "A rabbit rolling in the soybean field can still see its belly." There was also an episode: last year, the soybeans planted with new farm tools were earthed up by Liu Engui, four cun thick; the soybean field next to it was planted with old farm tools and earthed up by Qiao Dongyun, who only earthed up two cun because he wanted to be quick. What happened later? The soybeans planted with the old farm tools grew normally, while the soybeans planted with the sowing machine were short, yellow, and did not grow branches. Lü Shanxiang studied the situation at that time and summarized two lessons. The first lesson was that the planting was too deep – seven centimeters, and the cotyledons could not emerge (when the soybean seedlings emerged, the cotyledons were at the top), so the cotyledons had fallen off when the seedlings emerged, causing the seedlings to turn yellow and wither. The second lesson was that the earthing up was too thick. After summarizing these two experiences, this year, the sowing machine was still used to sow two rows, with a distance of four cun between each plant, shallow planting and shallow earthing up, and as a result, 462 jin of soybeans were produced per mu.

In addition to the role played by the sowing machine, the land preparation was also good. They practiced continuous deep plowing, fine harrowing, and after harrowing, they used stone rollers to compact the soil, with tree branches attached behind the stone rollers to smooth it out. This made the soil loose, flat, and broken, and easy to retain moisture. For example, this year, the wheat suffered from armyworms, but because it was planted early and had sufficient nutrients, the plants were strong. Although some of the leaves were eaten, it did not affect the harvest. A neighboring village had a plot of corn adjacent to the Gaokan Cooperative, which had reduced production due to flooding, while the Gaokan Cooperative's corn was not greatly affected because it was an average of two chi taller than the neighboring village's corn.

Not only did the new farm tools play a role, but before the wheat harvest, the technology guidance station also sent three tractors to help thresh, plow, and harrow the fields. From the wheat harvest to the completion of the autumn harvest, a total of 2,780 man-days and horse-days were saved for the cooperative; moreover, the land was plowed deeply, harrowed flat, and the grain was clean, avoiding waste and damage. If the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative's 125 mu of wheat and potatoes were completely harvested, threshed, plowed, and harrowed by manual and animal labor, it would take 700 workdays; the cooperative's total of 59 male laborers and 17 mules and horses, even if all their strength was used, would take ten days to complete. Facts have proved that new farm tools and tractors are equivalent to increasing the labor force of the cooperative, bringing in nearly 260,000 jin of grain.

Conscious Labor on the Basis of Democratic Management

One of the directors of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative, Zhao Guoshun, was narrow-minded, stubborn, and did not listen to the opinions of the cooperative members. This spring, when learning the Zhaoyuan farming method, he did everything possible to obstruct it and frustrate the will of the cooperative members. During the spring plowing season, the cooperative members unanimously proposed to re-elect the leading cadres, and no one voted for Zhao Guoshun. Immediately afterwards, the production organization was changed, and two agricultural production teams were established, each divided into four groups, with the women being organized separately under the leadership of the team. The production teams were also assigned fixed plots of land, and the fixed cooperative members were responsible for the entire production process from spring plowing to autumn harvest, which was convenient for launching production competitions. The production groups also implemented short-term contract work, which immediately increased labor efficiency by one-third. After the summer weeding began, the women also implemented the practice of calculating work based on the ridge for thinning seedlings. Communist Party member and women's committee member Zhao Gang anticipated that this was a meticulous task, and from the beginning, she paid attention to checking whether the grass had been pulled clean and whether the seedlings were left at equal distances. Later, it was stipulated that seedlings should be replanted where there were gaps, and she mobilized women to carry grain seeds in their pockets, replanting where there were gaps, and mobilizing everyone to supervise each other. When it was discovered that Meng Yulan had not replanted seedlings and did not accept others' opinions, they convened a women's meeting to launch mass criticism.

When Li Wende was driving a cart, he picked up more than seventy sorghum ears along the way. When he passed his own door, he did not put them at home, but quietly sent them to the cooperative's sorghum pile. "The cooperative" has become a common phrase for every cooperative member, just like they often say "home."

"I want to sell the surplus grain to the state"

Before the autumn harvest, the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative specially organized a distribution committee to write the number of workdays for each person, the amount of various grains that should be obtained, and the interest that should be obtained from land rent and production investment completely on the notification and send them to each cooperative member's home. All the families had to do was prepare the granary, and the cooperative even delivered firewood to the cooperative members' homes. No one had estimated that they could be distributed so much grain. After receiving the notice, they only knew from the numbers, but they didn't know how big a pile of grain these digits represented. As a result, many cooperative members' granaries were not large enough, and grain was everywhere in basins and jars.

Zhao Guoxu and his wife and son all joined the cooperative. The three of them earned 565 workdays. The labor aspect alone would yield 11,300 jin of grain, plus 5.1 million yuan in cash (from the sale of vegetables and sideline income). Zhao Guoxu said: "As soon as the grain entered my home, I immediately thought of Chairman Mao. I want to sell all the surplus grain to the state to help the state build the country." Liu Engui still had doubts about the cooperative last year, thinking that joining the cooperative was "working for the public," so he did not work hard, resulting in a distribution of only 2,000 jin of grain. This year, his thinking was clear, and he mobilized his wife to join the cooperative. The two of them earned 290 workdays. They planned to save money and sell more grain to the state, and use the money they earned to build two houses and also enclose a small courtyard. Zhao Hengyu, who is sixty years old, also earned 150 workdays this year. He said: "I have been farming since I was a teenager, and only now have I found the cooperative. I will never leave this path until I die. The new China has only been around for a few years, and the cooperative has been established. In the future, when the country's industry develops, our cooperative will improve even more, and life will be better."

Now, tractors are plowing and harrowing the land day and night. Some cooperative members are tidying up the 790 grapevines that have already been planted. In addition, two trucks are hauling bricks out of the village, preparing to dig wells and plant vegetables next spring. The Production Management Committee and the Technology Guidance Station are planning – to plant another half of cash crops next year, develop two-crop farming, plant more vegetables, and do their best to supply the needs of the city.

    高坎村农业生产合作社丰收
    本报记者　方青
    到高坎村去
    离开沈阳市，一直往东走，当你已经望到煤都抚顺的朵朵浓烟的时候，高坎村就在眼前了。一批一批的卡车，从这里把蔬菜运走。拖拉机正在突突地翻着地。村里，十几个人欢笑地围着一台飞转着的脱谷机忙碌着，虽然到处都飞扬着烟尘和绞碎了的豆叶，但并不能挡住人们张着大嘴说笑。这边是大堆的一尺多长的玉米棒子，那边又是红山似的高粱——不论从哪个角度看，都是一片丰收的景象。
    是的，高坎农业生产合作社获得了空前的丰收。这是一张分配生产果实的简略账单：全社五十八户，三百二十九人，土地九百四十七亩（每亩一千平方公尺），农业和副业生产总值共折成一百一十三万斤标准粮（拿玉米作标准粮，下同。千斤以下的零数概按四舍五入核算，下同。）
    在总产量中除去农业税、公积金、明年的籽种、饲料和今年的地租、社员投资利息以及生产开支、管理费用等，每个劳动日分四十斤标准粮，比去年每个劳动日分二十四斤半粮高百分之六十三以上。如果连社员所得的地租和投资应得的利息加在一起，拿全社人口来除，平均每人的收入是一千九百一十九斤。
    回过头去，看看旧社会的高坎村——占人口百分之八的地主，拥有百分之九十点七的土地，最高年产量，平均每亩只有三百七十斤粮。一九四八年解放后，实行土地改革，没收了地主的土地，在党的领导下，农民们组织互助组，去年又发展成农业生产合作社，今年由于改善了经营管理，提高了农业技术，获得了平均每亩七百六十七斤粮的丰收。
    新经验加拖拉机
    今年一月间，高坎农业生产合作社主任张振发，到肇源去参观，把任国栋的领导方法和丰产经验带回社里来。这以后，区上又召开了座谈会，聘请这个社的两位老农参加，研究如何在当地推广肇源耕作法。老农之一叫赵恒玉，把肇源耕作法概括成密和匀两个字。一九四九年，刘海林家种玉米，是由妇女刨埯种，她见男人是一步一棵苗，她也一步种一棵。她忘记了男人步子大，一步二尺半，她一步才迈二尺，因此她种的棵数就比别人多百分之二十。到秋收时一看，她种的玉米穗一点也不小，因此比别家玉米多收了百分之二十。这一事实恰好印证了肇源的经验。这样，大家的思想就慢慢地一致起来了，最后决定：按每一尺八寸的距离种玉米，垅宽也比以前紧缩了二寸。把每亩的棵数由以前的二千棵提高到二千九百余棵，这是使今年每亩玉米均产七百斤自然粮的主要原因。
      张振发介绍肇源丰产经验时，说种谷子要使垅宽苗散，在一条垅上留两行苗，犬牙交错，他们叫作
  “狗咬纹”。根据这个经验，农业技术员吕善祥面对着播种机想：肇源的丰产经验是好的，给我们很大启发；但他们是用的旧农具。我们既有新式马拉农具，就应当在现有基础上再提高一步。最后他把播种机上的“开沟器”并在一起，拿尺子一量，研究出了一条垅上播三行苗的办法，垅宽四寸五，每一寸五到二寸一棵苗，三行交错，留成“拐子苗”。这样播种和间苗的结果，把每亩棵数由肇源的四万棵，提高到五万三千余棵。一亩地平均打了六百五十斤。
    用播种机种麦子，社员十分拥护，但不同意用它种大豆。原因是去年用播种机种的大豆，有百分之二十没有出苗，棵小，结的荚都贴着土皮。群众说：“兔子在豆地里打滚，还能看见肚皮。”另外还有个插曲：去年用新农具种的大豆，是刘恩贵培土，四寸厚；紧挨着的一块豆地是用旧农具种的，由乔栋云培土，他因为图快，只培二寸厚。后来呢？旧农具种的生长很正常，播种机种的棵矮、发黄、不长杈。吕善祥把当时的情况一研究，总结了两条教训，第一条是种的太深——七公分，豆瓣顶不出来（豆苗出土时豆瓣在最上面），因而出苗时豆瓣已脱落，致使小苗枯黄。第二个教训是培土太厚。总结了这两条经验之后，今年还是用播种机双行播种，每棵之间距离四寸，浅种浅培，结果每亩产四百六十二斤大豆。
    除了播种机所发挥的作用以外，整地也好，他们实行连年深耕，细耙，耙后又用石磙轧实，石磙后面带着树枝敷平，这使土质松、平、碎，又易于保墒。比方今年小麦遭夜盗虫，但是由于种的早，养分充足，棵子粗壮，虽然有的叶子被吃光，但并没有影响收成。邻村有一块和高坎社毗连的玉米，因被水淹而减产，而高坎社的玉米则由于它比邻村玉米平均高二尺，因而产量没有受多大影响。
    不仅是新农具发挥了作用，麦收以前，技术指导站还来了三台拖拉机，帮助脱谷、翻地。仅仅从麦收到秋收完毕，统共节省了合作社二千七百八十个人工和马工；而且地翻的深，耙的平，粮食也干净，避免了糟损。高坎农业生产合作社的一百二十五亩的小麦和马铃薯，如果完全用人工、畜工来收割、打场、翻地、耙地，要用七百个工；全社总共五十九名男劳动力和十七匹骡马，把全部力量都用上，也要十天才能做完。事实证明：新农具和拖拉机等于给合作社增加了劳动力，带来将近二十六万斤粮食的收入。
    在民主管理的基础上自觉的劳动
    高坎农业生产合作社的理事之一，叫赵国顺，狭隘、固执，不听社员意见。今年春天学习肇源耕作法，他百般阻挠，挫折社员的意志。正在春耕期间，社员们一致提议，改选领导干部，谁也没有投赵国顺的票。紧接着又改变了生产组织，成立两个农业生产队，每队下分四个组，妇女单另编组，归队领导。生产队又都固定地段，从春耕到秋收全部生产过程，由固定的社员负责，便于发动生产竞赛。生产组又实行了短期包工，立刻把劳动效率提高了三分之一。夏锄开始后，妇女们间苗也实行了按垅计工，共产党员、妇女委员赵刚，事先估计到这是个细致工作，一开始就注意了检查草拔净了没有，留苗是否等距。后来又规定缺苗的地方要补种，她又发动妇女在口袋里装谷籽，有缺者即补，并发动大家互相监督。发现孟玉兰没有补苗，还不接受别人的意见，她们就召集妇女会，展开群众性的批评。
    李文德赶车时，沿路捡了七十多个高粱穗，路过自己的门口时，没有把它放到家里，而是不声不响地送到社里的高粱垛上去。“社里”，已经成为每个社员的口头语，就和他们经常说“家里”一样。
    “我要把多余的粮食卖给国家”
    秋收以前，高坎农业生产合作社专门组织了分配委员会，把每人的劳动日，应得的各种粮数，以及地租、生产投资应得的利息，完全写在通知书上，送到每个社员家里去。各家只要把粮仓准备好就行，合作社连烧柴都给社员送到家去。社员们谁也没有估计到能分这么多粮，接到通知书后，也只是从数目字上知道了，还不晓得这几个洋字码顶多么大一堆粮，因此好多社员家里的粮囤盛不下，弄得盆里、罐里到处都是粮食。
    赵国绪老两口子和一个儿子都入了社，三个人得五百六十五个劳动日，仅劳动方面所得，即有一万一千三百斤粮，还得五百一十万元现款（这是卖菜所得和副业收入）。赵国绪说：“粮食一进家，我一下子就想起了毛主席。我要把多余的粮食全部卖给国家，帮助国家建设。”刘恩贵去年还对合作社心存疑虑，以为入社是“给公家干活”，因此做活煞不下腰去，结果分两千多斤粮。今年思想通了，把老婆也动员入了社，两口子得了二百九十个劳动日，他们计划省吃俭用，多卖给国家一些粮，把所得的钱来盖两间房，还能圈起个小院套。六十岁的赵恒玉，今年还得了一百五十个劳动日，他说：“打十几岁就下庄稼地，直到现在才找到了合作社，我算至死也不离开这条道。新中国才这么几年，合作社就办起来了，以后国家的工业发展了，咱们的社就更提高，生活就会更好。”
    现在，拖拉机正在昼夜不停地翻地、耙地。一部分社员在整理已经栽好的七百九十棵葡萄。另有两辆车往村外拉砖，准备明年春天打井种菜。生产管理委员会和技术指导站正在计划——明年再多种二分之一的商品粮，发展两槎作物，多种蔬菜，尽最大努力供应城市需要。
