In the increase production and practice economy campaign, new imbalances have emerged in the production of factories and enterprises in Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province. For example, in the fitter workshop of the Non-Ferrous Metal Repair Factory, work efficiency was improved by learning from advanced experiences and finding shortcuts, but the supply of raw materials could not keep up. The dispatching section chief was so anxious that he said, "I simply don't know how to deal with the fitter workshop. If they are asked to tap their potential further, it will lead to shortages.” The newly installed Fourdrinier paper machine at the Gannan People's Paper Mill could not get enough water when it started production. In the past, the fermentation workshop of the Gannan People's Sugar Factory supplied too much mash, and the distillation workshop could not handle it. The fermentation workshop once reduced the operation plan, leaving two vats unmade. Later, the distillation workshop found a shortcut and the output suddenly rose, creating a new record since the factory was built. The fermentation workshop then could not keep up with the supply, forcing the distillation workshop to shut down. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the movement, the Ganzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened a meeting instructing all factory and enterprise departments to seize the opportunity to further mobilize the masses and implement the method of revising plans while carrying out competitions. At the same time, 30 key cadres from the Municipal Party Committee, the Trade Union, the Youth League and other departments have been drawn to form seven working groups, which will go deep into various factories and enterprises to check the implementation of the increase production and practice economy plan and provide specific assistance.

    赣州市各工厂在增产节约运动中
    生产上出现了新的不平衡现象
    江西省赣州市各工厂企业在增产节约运动中，生产上出现了新的不平衡现象。如有色金属修造厂钳工间因学习先进经验、找窍门提高了工作效率，原材料就供应不上，调度股长急得没法，说：“简直不知怎样对付钳工间，再叫他们挖潜力，会要出‘皮漏’了。”赣西南人民造纸厂新装长网机开始生产，给水便来不及；赣西南人民糖厂过去醱酵间供醪过多，蒸馏间做不赢，醱酵间曾削减作业计划除两槽不制，后来蒸馏间找到窍门，产量突然上升，创建厂以来新纪录，醱酵间便转而供应不及了，迫使蒸馏间停工。为了使运动顺利进展，中共赣州市委已召集会议，指示各工厂企业部门，应抓紧时机，进一步发动群众，贯彻边开展竞赛边修订计划的方法；同时抽调全市党委、工会、青年团等部门主要干部三十人，组成七个工作组，分别深入到各工厂企业中去，检查增产节约计划执行情况，并进行具体帮助。
