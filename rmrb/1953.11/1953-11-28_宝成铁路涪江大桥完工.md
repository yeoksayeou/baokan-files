Xinhua News Agency report: The Fujiang River Bridge, the last major bridge project in this year's construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway (formerly known as the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway, this railway has been rerouted from Baoji to Chengdu and renamed the Baoji-Chengdu Railway), was completed on November 21st. The Fujiang River Bridge is one of the largest bridge projects on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The bridge body is 371.48 meters long and has a total of 19 spans. The completion of this bridge solves a key problem in completing this year's construction task for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. From now on, tools and materials needed for the project north of the Fujiang River can be directly transported to the construction site through this bridge, enabling the track laying, bridge, and culvert projects north of the Fujiang River to commence ahead of schedule or be accelerated.

    宝成铁路涪江大桥完工
    据新华社讯：宝成铁路（即天成铁路，这条铁路已改线从宝鸡到成都，改名宝成铁路）今年度修建工程中的最后一座大桥——涪江大桥，已在十一月二十一日完工。涪江大桥是宝成铁路最大的桥梁工程之一。桥身全长三百七十一点四八公尺，共十九孔。这座大桥的完工等于解决了今年宝成铁路完成全年施工任务的一个关键问题。从此，涪江以北工程所需要的工具和材料就可以通过这座大桥直接运送到工地，使涪江以北铁路的铺轨、桥涵等工程得以提前动工或加速进行。
