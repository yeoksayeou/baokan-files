Basic construction projects under the Ministry of Heavy Industry are being intensified, and some projects have been completed and put into production. The commencement of basic construction projects under the Ministry of Heavy Industry this year was relatively late. Although the progress of projects in the first half of the year showed significant improvement compared to the same period last year, the overall progress was still considered slow. Since July, due to the thorough implementation of the responsibility system and the promotion of work plans by various construction units, many projects have been able to complete their plans on a monthly basis, and some have even exceeded their monthly plans. As for the basic construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang), in addition to the seamless steel tube plant which was completed ahead of schedule on October 31 and fully handed over to the production departments, the large rolling mill project is also nearing completion. The project exceeded its planned target for both August and September. The No. 15 and 16 coke ovens of the No. 7 blast furnace system completed 142 percent of the monthly plan in September and exceeded the third-quarter plan. Although the No. 7 blast furnace project currently faces significant challenges, with the support of all parties, efforts are being made to achieve iron production by the end of this year. The basic construction projects of Longyan Iron Mine had completed 73 percent of the annual plan by the end of September, with the No. 4 and No. 1 blast furnaces having been completed and put into production on July 10 and September 30, respectively. Of the six blast furnaces planned to be repaired at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant this year, the No. 2 blast furnace was put into production on September 16, the No. 1 blast furnace in mid-October, and the No. 4 blast furnace will be completed and put into production soon. The other three blast furnaces are expected to be completed successively before December. The Second Steel Plant had been lagging behind in fulfilling its plan, but with the adoption of necessary measures, it exceeded its monthly plan in September, with the progress in that one month accounting for more than 30 percent of the annual plan. The No. 301 Factory project completed 126 percent of its plan in the third quarter, and by the end of September, it had completed 70.9 percent of the annual plan. The factory's 120-meter-high chimney was completed 42 days ahead of schedule on September 18. The No. 101 Factory in Harbin had completed 77 percent of its annual plan by the end of September. The No. 501 Factory in Shandong also exceeded its monthly plan in September. The basic construction projects of Yunnan Tin Company had completed 66 percent of the annual plan by the end of September. The company's Datun No. 1 Ore Dressing Plant has been undergoing trial runs since September and is now in production; the two generators of the Kaiyuan Thermal Power Plant have been operating and transmitting electricity; and the new Laochang-Datun cableway project is largely completed. The main projects of Dongchuan Copper Mine have all completed or exceeded their third-quarter plans. The Shenyang Smelter has completed 80.4 percent of its annual plan, with the expansion project of copper electrolysis having been completed in early September. The Dalian Chemical Plant project also exceeded its third-quarter plan, with the third set of synthetic ammonia facilities largely completed and expected to be put into production soon. The restoration project of the Eighth Cement Plant had completed 90 percent of its annual plan by the end of September, with the cement plant project basically completed and undergoing adjustment and trial runs. In addition, the entire project of the Northeast Institute of Technology had completed 78 percent of its annual plan by the end of September, the main projects of the Dalian Institute of Technology have been completed, and the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology project is also expected to be completed according to the annual plan.
