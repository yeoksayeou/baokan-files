    Do a Good Job of Summarizing Work to Greet New Tasks Next Year
    The Central-South Region Decides to Conduct a Major Inspection of Design Quality
    In order to welcome the new design tasks for 1954, the Central-South Region convened a design conference in mid-October. At the meeting, design work experience was summarized and exchanged, and future work tasks were arranged. The Central-South Region has made considerable achievements in design work over the past year: First, the number of design and technical cadres in the region has more than doubled compared to last year, and the design quality and work efficiency have greatly improved compared to last year. By September, this year's design tasks had been basically completed. Second, the ideological level of design personnel has been raised. Some advanced Soviet experiences have been learned and promoted in the work. Third, the management work of the design department has been improved, and some units have begun to implement group work plans and parallel assembly line operations. However, design work still cannot keep up with the needs of national construction, and the shortcomings in the work are still very serious. For example, in the Nanchang Paper Mill project, the designed water tower capacity exceeded twice the maximum production capacity required by the factory; according to the design, the factory's sewage would be discharged entirely into the lake that supplies drinking water to the surrounding masses, turning the lake into a stinky pond. The designers of the Wuhan Oils Export Company's oil pool foundation project did not conduct soil tests, and as a result, the foundation settled after construction. The office building of the Central-South Administrative Committee also experienced uneven foundation settlement after the building was completed due to an incomplete understanding of the geological conditions, cracks appeared in the expansion joints, rainwater leaked from upstairs to downstairs, and the basement was also filled with water because the groundwater level was not well understood. Secondly, administrative management work is weak, and plan management, operation plans, and the responsibility system in design have not yet been universally implemented. In addition, the use of forces has not been balanced enough, and the phenomenon of large-scale idleness on the one hand and rushing work on the other, and design not keeping up with construction, has occurred.
    The meeting pointed out the above shortcomings and determined that strengthening the ideological education of design personnel, establishing correct design thinking, and further launching a upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union are the most important tasks for the design department at present. The meeting requested that all units mobilize a large number of design personnel to go deep into construction sites to conduct a major inspection of design quality, and with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, do a good job of summarizing the work at the end of the year and draw a clear line between socialist design thinking and bourgeois design thinking. The meeting pointed out that all units can hold a large number of training courses, seminars, organize visits, and systematically introduce or reprint books on advanced Soviet experience, organize design personnel to learn Russian, and further launch a upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union. The meeting also determined that while summarizing work and learning advanced Soviet experience, it is also necessary to strengthen plan management and establish a responsibility system, in order to lay the foundation for doing a good job in future design work.

    做好总结工作迎接明年新的任务
    中南区决定进行设计质量大检查
    中南区为迎接一九五四年新的设计任务，于十月中旬召开了设计会议。会上总结与交流了设计工作经验，并布置了今后的工作任务。中南区一年来在设计工作方面已作出不少成绩：一、全区设计技术干部较去年增加了一倍以上，设计质量和工作效率比去年大大提高，至九月中已基本上完成了今年的设计任务。二、设计人员的思想水平有了提高。在工作中学习与推行了一些苏联先进经验。三、设计部门的管理工作有了改进，有些单位已开始推行小组作业计划，实行平行流水作业。但是设计工作还赶不上国家建设的需要，工作中的缺点还是很严重的。如南昌造纸厂工程，设计的水塔容量超过该厂最大生产能力所需的二倍；按设计该厂的污水要全部排到供周围群众饮水的湖内，使这个湖变成一个臭水塘。武汉油脂出口公司油池基础工程的设计者没有做土壤试验，结果建成后基础下沉。中南行政委员会办公大楼也因对地质情况没有彻底了解，房屋建好后，基础下沉不均，伸缩缝发生裂痕，楼上下雨，楼下流水；因为对地下水位没有很好了解，现在地下室也灌满了水。其次，行政管理工作薄弱，设计中的计划管理，作业计划，责任制尚未普遍推行。此外，在力量使用上还不够平衡，曾产生了一面大量窝工、一面赶工和设计赶不上施工的现象。
    会议指出上述缺点后确定：加强设计人员的思想教育工作，树立正确的设计思想，进一步掀起学习苏联的热潮，是当前设计部门中最主要的任务。会议要求各单位动员大批设计人员深入工地，进行设计质量大检查，以批评与自我批评的精神，做好年终总结工作，划清社会主义设计思想与资产阶级设计思想的界限。会议指出，各单位可大量举办训练班、座谈会，组织参观及有系统地介绍或翻印苏联先进经验的书籍，组织设计人员学俄文，进一步掀起学习苏联的热潮。会议还确定与总结工作、学习苏联先进经验的同时，还必须加强计划管理，建立责任制度，为做好今后的设计工作打下基础。
