    This is the American Leading Figure
    Capitalist and Minister
    In order to strengthen their direct control over the American government, American monopoly capitalists, who used to be behind-the-scenes string-pullers of American policy, have now directly taken the ministerial seats and personally issued orders. Let's take a look at the faces of these American leading figures:

    Secretary of Defense Wilson – General Manager of General Motors Corporation.
    Secretary of the Army Stevens – Director of General Electric Company.
    Secretary of the Navy Anderson – Deputy General Manager of Union Oil Company.
    Secretary of the Air Force Talbott – Director of National Commercial Trust Company.
    Secretary of the Interior McKay – Large Dealer of General Motors Corporation.
    Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey – Chairman of Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company.
    Secretary of Commerce Weeks – Director of First National Bank of Boston.
    Attorney General Brownell – Deputy General Manager of American World Trade Corporation.
    Secretary of Labor Mitchell – Deputy General Manager of Bloomingdale Brothers Department Store in New York City.
    Director of the Budget Dodge – General Manager of Detroit Bank.
    Postmaster General Summerfield – General Manager of Michigan Real Estate Company.
    Deputy Director of the Mutual Security Agency Rand – General Manager of Monsanto Chemical Company.

    The Rise of McCarthy
    Ten years ago, McCarthy was indeed unknown. At that time, he was just an ordinary intelligence officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. But now, in the eyes of Wall Street bosses, McCarthy has become a remarkable figure, so they made him the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the main U.S. secret service agency.

    McCarthy's rise to power began in 1946, when Wisconsin was electing state legislators. McCarthy relied on his flattery and catering to capitalists, and he suddenly became lucky and climbed to the position of state senator. In 1949, he delivered a speech in West Virginia attacking Acheson's State Department for having "communists," which was even more valued by Wall Street bosses. After McCarthy discovered this "trick" to climb up, his anti-communist and anti-people activities became even more rampant. In June 1951, he attacked Marshall, the famous American warmonger, saying that Marshall "conspired to help the Soviet Union," to show that he loved war even more than Marshall. In 1952, he wanted to investigate the State Department's so-called "pro-communist policy" to show his anti-communist fanaticism. This February, he launched an "investigation of the Voice of America," and then launched a campaign to "cleanse" books in American overseas libraries. Thus, the term McCarthyism was born. This term is a general term for all the most reactionary and darkest things.

    In the past few years, along with his successful official career, McCarthy has also made a fortune. In December 1945, McCarthy still owed Wisconsin banks more than $169,000, but now McCarthy has not only paid off his debts, but also has more than $176,000 in savings. Where did this money come from? McCarthy also has his "trick." For example, every time he makes an anti-communist and anti-people clamor, he can get a check of several thousand dollars from American capitalists; he can earn more than $17,000 from a soybean speculation deal with Chiang Kai-shek's remnants who fled to the United States. In addition, the money he obtained through bribery by taking advantage of his position and embezzling the anti-communist funds "donated" by capitalists is countless.

    McCarthy's various evil deeds are not only hated by the American people, but even the British bourgeois newspaper "Sunday Graphic" said: "McCarthyism is the most hateful and most stinking force in American life today." Even U.S. Democratic Senator Lehman, who recently visited various countries in Western Europe, admitted that McCarthyism is "a great threat" to the United States, and it makes European people "regard the United States as a country shrouded in the shadow of domestically produced fascism," and "believe that the American people are completely trapped in fear, panic, and hysteria."

    这就是美国首脑人物
    资本家兼部长
    美国垄断资本家为了加强对美国政府的直接控制，过去是美国政策幕后牵线人的一些华尔街老板，今天已经直接坐上了部长的宝座，亲自发号施令了。请看这些美国首脑人物的面目吧：
    国防部长威尔逊——美国通用汽车公司总经理。
    陆军部长斯蒂文斯——美国奇异电气公司董事。
    海军部长安德逊——美国联合炼油公司副总经理。
    空军部长泰尔波特——美国国民商业信托公司董事。
    内政部长麦凯——美国通用汽车公司大经售商。
    财政部长汉弗莱——匹兹堡固本煤炭公司董事长。
    商务部长威克斯——波士顿第一国家银行董事。
    司法部长布朗纳尔——美国世界贸易公司副总经理。
    劳工部长密契尔——纽约市布鲁明达尔兄弟百货商店副总经理。
    预算局长道奇——底特律银行总经理。
    邮政总局长萨末菲尔——密执安州地产公司总经理。
    共同安全署副署长兰德——孟山都化学公司总经理。
    麦卡锡的起家
    十年以前的麦卡锡，的确还没有一点名气，当时，他只不过是美国海军陆战队中一个普通的情报官而已；可是现在，麦卡锡在华尔街老板的心目中，已经成了一个了不起的人物，所以就让他做了美国主要的特务机关——参议院常设调查小组委员会的主席。
    麦卡锡的开始得势，是在一九四六年，那时威斯康星州正在选举州议员，麦卡锡凭着他在资本家面前的奔走逢迎，一下走了红运，登时就爬上了州参议员的位子。一九四九年，他在西弗吉尼亚州发表了一篇攻击艾奇逊的国务院有“共产党”的演说，这更加受到华尔街老板的看重。麦卡锡摸到了这个向上爬的“窍门”之后，他的反共反人民的活动越发猖狂起来。一九五一年六月他攻击美国著名的战争贩子马歇尔，说马歇尔“阴谋帮助苏联”；以表示他比马歇尔还更喜爱战争；一九五二年他要检查国务院的所谓“亲共政策”，以表示他的反共狂热；今年二月他发起“调查美国之音”，跟着他又发动了“清洗”美国国外图书馆中藏书的运动。于是，麦卡锡主义这个名词就产生了。这个名词是一切最反动最黑暗的事情的总称。
    几年以来，与官运亨通的同时，麦卡锡也在大发横财。一九四五年十二月，麦卡锡还欠威斯康星州银行十六万九千多美元的债，而现在麦卡锡不但还清了债，而且还有了十七万六千多美元的存款。这些钱是那里来的呢？麦卡锡也有他的“窍门”。例如他每作一次反共反人民的叫嚣，就能得到美国资本家开给他的几千美元的支票；他同亡命美国的蒋介石残匪合作一次大豆投机买卖，就可捞到一万七千多美元。另外，他利用职权受贿得来的钱和贪污资本家“捐助”的反共基金更是不计其数。
    麦卡锡的种种恶行，不仅为美国人民所痛恨，就连英国资产阶级报刊“星期日画报”也说：“麦卡锡主义就是今天美国生活中最令人憎恶，最臭不可闻的一种势力。”甚至不久前访问过西欧各国的美国民主党参议员利曼也承认：麦卡锡主义对于美国“是一个很大的威胁”，它使欧洲人民把美国“看作是已被国产的法西斯阴影所笼罩的国家”，“认为美国人民完全陷于恐惧、惊慌和歇斯底里状态中。”
