Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: The young workers of the Moscow Three Mountains Textile Factory have established "Economy Sentry Posts" and inspection groups to vigorously promote a system of thrift.

    The Three Mountains Textile Factory has achieved new successes in practicing thrift this year. In the first half of this year, the factory overfulfilled its production plan by producing products worth 10 million rubles, gaining an additional 3 million rubles in profit, and saving a total of 21.9 tons of cotton and 38.9 tons of yarn. The contribution of the young workers has been significant. For example, Youth League members Balashov and Belavenchiva initiated a competition to reduce waste and non-productive expenses. The group led by Belavenchiva implemented savings from every centimeter of dye used in dyeing cloth. By simply utilizing used dye solutions, they aim to save 26,000 rubles this year by reducing production losses. Weaver and Youth League member Shivaeva adopted a rapid method, saving production time from each operation, thus consistently exceeding her quota. Currently, under the leadership of the Party organization, the factory's youth organization is adopting many methods to promote the production and thrift experience of these advanced workers.

    The Youth League members of the factory have also adopted many organizational forms to save raw materials and supplies. They have established "Economy Sentry Posts" to carefully monitor the implementation of systems, the conservation of materials, and the amount of waste in the workshops. On one occasion, dyer Babayev carelessly spilled paint on the machine, and Mareseva, a member of the "Economy Sentry Post," immediately explained to him that the paint was expensive and that he should not be careless with the people's property, thereby losing the honor of a Youth League member. In addition, the Youth League members have organized inspection groups to more closely examine losses. The Youth League Committee often listens to reports from the "Economy Sentry Posts" and inspection groups, summarizes good experiences, and raises urgent issues in production activities with the administration and other organizations of the factory.

    莫斯科三山纺织厂建立“节约岗哨”厉行节约
    【新华社莫斯科三十一日电】莫斯科三山纺织厂青年工人建立了“节约岗哨”和检查小组，努力推行节约制度。
    三山纺织厂今年在厉行节约方面有了新成就。今年前半年该厂超计划生产了价值一千万卢布的产品，多获得三百万卢布的利润，共节约了二十一点九吨棉花、三十八点九吨纱。青年工人的贡献是很大的。例如青年团员巴拉萧夫和别拉文契娃发起了减少损失和非生产费用的竞赛，别拉文契娃所领导的小组就从染布的每一个公分颜料中实行节约，单利用用过的染料溶液，就要在今年内从减少生产损失中节约二万六千卢布。织工、女青年团员希娃耶娃采用了快速方法，从每一操作中节约生产时间，因此她一贯超额完成定额。目前，工厂的青年组织在党组织的领导下，正采用许多方法，推广这些先进工人生产节约的经验。
    工厂的青年团员还采取了许多组织形式，节约原料与物资。他们成立了“节约岗哨”，精心地注意车间内执行制度、节用物资的情况和损失的多少。有一次印染工人巴巴耶夫由于不小心将颜料洒在机器上面，“节约岗哨”的组员马列谢娃就马上向他讲解颜料价值昂贵，不应该粗心对待人民的财产，丢去青年团员的荣誉。此外，青年团员们还组织了检查小组，更细致地检查损失。青年团委员会常常听取“节约岗哨”和检查小组的报告，总结好的经验，并向行政及工厂的其他组织提出生产活动中的迫切问题。
