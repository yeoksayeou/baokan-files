The degree of mechanized coal mining in national state-owned coal mines has greatly developed. Up to now, according to statistics, the degree of mechanized coal mining in the country has reached 23.2% (excluding mechanical equipment for drilling and blasting), the degree of mechanization of coal face transportation has reached 85.6%, the degree of mechanization of roadway transportation has reached 66.03%, and the use of mechanical ventilation in mines has accounted for 92%. The implementation of mechanization has greatly changed the face of China's coal mines.

The promotion of mechanized coal mining is more common in the Northeast region. In some coal pits in the state-owned coal mines in the Northeast region, the entire production process, from cutting coal, crushing coal, loading coal, transporting coal, selecting coal, to loading it onto trains and transporting it out, has achieved mechanization. Mining areas such as Shuangyashan, Jixi, and Fuxin have all adopted the "Donbas" type combined coal mining machine. Its rotating coal cutting device cuts the coal seam, and the large pieces of coal that fall are crushed by the rotating coal crushing machinery. Then, a large amount of loose small coal pieces are shoveled up by special coal loading machinery and transported to the transportation machine on the working face for removal. A "Donbas" type combined coal mining machine in the Shuangyashan mining area created a record of producing 11,826 tons of coal in May of this year. In mining areas such as Hegang, Fuxin, Jixi, Shuangyashan, Jiaohe, Fushun, Xi'an, Benxi, Tonghua, and Beipiao, various new mechanized coal mining equipment such as coal cutting machines, pneumatic picks, and electric shovels have been used in large quantities. More than 80% of the coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine in East China is now mined mechanically. The bureau's mechanized mining volume from January to May 1953 has reached 88.86% of the total mining volume. Compared with the first half of this year and the same period last year, the degree of mechanization on the coal mining and tunneling faces has increased by 82%. The coal mining faces of two of the four mines under the bureau's jurisdiction have been completely mechanized, and workers use pneumatic picks, pneumatic drills, and coal cutting machines to mine coal. The two main underground transportation roadways of the Datong and Jiulonggang mines in Huainan are all transported by small electric cars. The entire ground transportation process from the pit mouth where coal is produced to loading coal onto the train in the Datong mine also uses ingenious machinery such as "automatic tumbling cages" and "belt conveyors." More than 73% of the coal mining faces in the Pingxiang Coal Mine have been converted to pneumatic picks and electric drills for coal mining. The main mine in the mine, Gaokeng Mine, began using coal cutting machines in late August of this year.

The result of using new mechanical equipment in coal mines in various places has not only reduced the physical labor of coal miners, but also greatly improved labor productivity. The coal mining efficiency of underground workers in state-owned coal mines in Northeast China in the first half of 1953 increased by 56% compared with 1949. The efficiency of the coal cutting machine in the fourth coal mining area of the Linxi Mine in Kailuan Mine is also very high. On average, each coal cutting machine produces 496 tons of coal per day, and the 6482 coal mining face has created a record of producing 822 tons of coal per day, which is more than one and a half times the national standard. Due to the improvement of mechanization and other aspects, the production efficiency of coal mining workers in Datong Mine in the first half of this year has increased by 22% compared with the same period last year, the efficiency of tunneling workers has increased by 17%, and the work efficiency of underground transportation workers has increased by nine times compared with manual transportation workers.

In individual mining areas in China, the latest mechanized equipment has appeared. The Laohutai Mine in Fushun Coal Mine has been built into a mechanized coal mine stone transportation system. It is currently one of the largest inclined shaft stone transportation projects in China. It can lift and transport more than one million kilograms of rock every day, and the entire stone transportation process is entirely mechanical. Recently, the Jiaohe Coal Mine has also installed a new Soviet-made Type B coal mining "combine," which can not only cut coal, but also load and transport coal. This coal mining "combine" has been working hard underground since October 4.

With the improvement of the degree of mechanization of mines, new technical forces are constantly growing in mining areas. The first batch of coal cutting machine operators has appeared in the Huainan Coal Mine. The number of coal miners in the mine who have learned the new Soviet "horizontal layered wooden board false top" coal mining method is also increasing. According to statistics from the Jiulonggang Coal Mine, workers in seven of the nine coal mining teams have mastered this advanced technology. Employees of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine are actively improving their professional skills to adapt to the needs of mechanized coal mining. More than 80 members of the mine's transportation team have become qualified electric locomotive drivers after two months of study. The personnel in the production dispatch room have basically mastered the work of the dispatch room after one month of study. With the help of Soviet experts, Jixi, Shuangyashan, Hegang, Fuxin and other mining areas have also opened technical training classes such as "Combine - Combined Coal Mining Machine," "Coal Cutting Machine," "Coal Loading Machine," and "Rock Loading Machine." Through methods such as master apprenticeship and technical research associations, a large number of skilled technical workers who operate machinery have been trained. Miners who originally used manual coal planing can now operate huge electric shovels and sophisticated "Donbas" combined coal mining machines by pressing buttons. Skilled coal cutting machine operators, self-tipping truck drivers, and other skilled and excellent machinery operators are constantly growing.

    全国国营煤矿机械化采煤程度大大提高
    许多煤矿新的技术力量不断增长
    全国国营煤矿机械化采煤已有很大发展。到目前为止，据统计全国煤矿机械化采煤程度已达百分之二十三点二（不包括打眼放炮的机械设备在内），采煤工作面运输机械化程度已达百分之八十五点六，巷道运输机械化程度已达百分之六十六点零三，采用机械化通风的矿井已占百分之九十二。实行机械化的结果，使得我国煤矿的面貌已大大改变。
    机械化采煤以东北地区推行得较为普遍，东北区的国营煤矿有部分煤坑从割煤、碎煤、装煤、运煤、选煤到装上火车运出去，已达到全部生产过程的机械化。双鸭、鸡西、阜新等矿区都已采用“顿巴斯”型联合采煤机，它的旋转的截煤装置切割着煤层，掉下的大块煤炭被转动的碎煤的机械击碎，然后大量的松散的小煤块就被特殊装煤机械铲起装到工作面的运输机上运出。双鸭矿区的一台“顿巴斯”型联合采煤机，在今年五月份内曾创造了产煤一万一千八百二十六吨的最高纪录。在鹤岗、阜新、鸡西、双鸭、蛟河、抚顺、西安、本溪、通化、北票等矿区已经大量使用截煤机、风镐、电铲等各种新式机械化采煤设备。华东区的淮南煤矿现在出产的煤中有百分之八十以上是用机械开采出来的，该局一九五三年一月至五月的机械化回采量，已达到总回采量的百分之八十八点八六。若以今年上半年和去年同期比较，采煤和掘进工作面上的机械化程度已提高了百分之八十二。该局所属的四个矿中有两个矿的采煤工作面已全部机械化，工人们都用风镐、风钻和割煤机等机械来采煤。淮南大通和九龙岗两矿井下两条主要运输大巷，全用小电车运输，大通矿从出煤的井口到装煤上火车的整个地面运输过程，也都采用了灵巧的“自动翻滚笼”和“皮带运输机”等机械。萍乡煤矿全矿百分之七十三以上的采煤工作面已经改用风镐和电钻采煤。该矿主要矿场高坑矿，今年八月下旬已开始采用割煤机。
    各地煤矿采用新式机械的结果，不仅减轻了煤矿工人的体力劳动，并且大大提高了劳动生产率。东北国营煤矿一九五三年上半年井下工人的采煤效率比一九四九年提高百分之五十六。开滦矿林西矿第四采煤区的割煤机效率也很高，平均每台割煤机日产四百九十六吨煤，其中六四八二采煤掌子并创造出日产八百二十二吨煤的纪录，超过全国标准一倍半以上。由于机械化程度的提高和其他方面的改善，今年上半年大通矿采煤工人的生产效率已比去年同期提高百分之二十二，掘进工人效率提高百分之十七，井下运输工人的工作效率有的已比人力运输工提高了九倍。
    在我国个别矿区，已出现了最新式的机械化设备。抚顺煤矿的老虎台矿已修建成一个机械化的煤矿运石系统，它是目前我国已有的斜井运石工程中规模较大的一个，它每天能提运一百万公斤以上的岩石，整个运石过程全部是使用机械。最近蛟河煤矿也装置了一台最新式的苏联乙型采煤“康拜因”，它不仅能截煤，还能装煤、运煤。这台采煤“康拜因”，从十月四日起已在地下开始了紧张的工作。
    随着矿山机械化程度的提高，各地矿区新的技术力量正在不断增长。淮南煤矿第一批割煤机手已经出现。该矿全矿区学会苏联“水平分层式木板假顶”新采煤法的采煤工人也日益增多，根据九龙岗煤矿的统计，九个采煤队中就有七个采煤队的工人掌握了这一先进技术。阜新海州露天矿职工正积极提高业务水平，以适应机械化采煤的需要。该矿运输队有八十多人经过两个月的学习，都已成为合格的电机车司机。生产调度室的人员经过一个月的学习，已基本上掌握了调度室的工作。在苏联专家的帮助下，鸡西、双鸭、鹤岗、阜新等矿区也开办了“康拜因——联合采煤机”、“截煤机”、“装煤机”、“装岩机”等技术训练班。并通过师傅带徒弟、技术研究会等方式，训练了大批熟练的操纵机械的技术工人。原来用手工刨煤的矿工，现在已能按电钮操纵庞大的电铲和精巧的“顿巴斯”联合采煤机了。熟练的截煤机手、自翻车司机等熟练而优秀的操纵机械工人，正不断地成长起来。
