    Confession of Lieutenant Robert C. Ruyle, Navigator of the 13th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Group, 3rd Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force
    I, Robert Carl Ruyle, was born on July 1, 1916, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. My home is now in Los Angeles, California, USA. I joined the U.S. Air Force in August 1942 and was sent to the Pacific Theater in 1944, returning to the United States in May 1946, at which time I retired from the Air Force and resumed civilian life. In October 1951, I was recalled into service. I left the United States for Korea in May 1952 and arrived at K-8 base in Gunsan, Korea on June 1, 1952. I was assigned to the 13th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Group, 3rd Bombardment Wing as a navigator.

    Around June 12, 1952, I was notified to report to the Operations Section of the Group to attend a special intelligence briefing in the Group briefing room. About twenty pilots and navigators attended the briefing. The lecturer was Captain Kasparek. He said that the purpose of the lecture was to familiarize us with a type of germ bomb and certain necessary procedures so that it could be used safely in combat.

    He first displayed a wooden model of the bomb, about the size of a 500-pound ordinary bomb. The bomb had four compartments, each of which could contain germ-infected insects. Each compartment had a door that could be opened by a screw. This screw ran through the interior of the germ bomb and was connected to the propeller at the tail of the bomb. When the bomb was dropped, the propeller at the tail rotated many times per second, so that the door was opened at a certain height. The head of the bomb had a fuse that would detonate the shell upon impact with the ground.

    He said that in order to avoid any possibility of causing an epidemic in South Korea, the following emergency measures must be taken in the event of an accident. For example, if an aircraft carrying a germ bomb had engine failure during takeoff and the pilot was unable to stop the aircraft on the runway, he should steer the aircraft into the Yellow Sea at the west end of the runway, or into the reservoir at the east end of the runway. If it was absolutely impossible to drop the germ bomb in North Korea, and there was even a slight chance of an accident on the way back to base, then we should steer the aircraft out to sea and then parachute out.

    I asked Captain Kasparek if there were such germ bombs at K-8 base, and he said there were. He said that there were other types of germ bombs as well, but only this type was relevant to us.

    Around June 14, 1952, I came into contact with germ bombs for the first time. That day, Lieutenant LeRoy Pike, my pilot, and I were assigned to fly a "special mission." After conveying the general orders, Captain Kasparek said: All crews assigned to fly special missions stay behind for a special briefing. During the special briefing, he told us: We are carrying germ bombs, and we will not see any explosions. He then repeated the emergency measures he had already mentioned when explaining the germ bomb, and told us to drop the germ bombs on Yangdeok.

    When Pike and I went to inspect the aircraft, I found that the bombs were exactly the same as the model I had seen before, a total of two, made of metal, unlike the wooden model.

    We took off on time and dropped the germ bombs on the designated target. After the germ bombs left the aircraft, we saw nothing. After patrolling along the designated route, we returned to base at about 1:45. My report on the germ bombs to the reporting officer was: "Bombs dropped on designated target, observation unclear."

    After this, Lieutenant Pike and I carried out six more germ bomb missions together.

    Around June 16, we dropped two germ bombs on Hwangju.

    Around June 19, we dropped two germ bombs on Kyanipo, about ten miles east of Chinnampo.

    Around June 22, we dropped two germ bombs on Chunghwa. The weather was dark with scattered clouds, and the bombing was slightly south of the target.

    Around June 25, we dropped two germ bombs on Singye. We lowered our altitude to see if we could see anything, but our aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire in four places.

    Around July 8, we dropped two germ bombs on Suan.

    My last germ mission was around July 17. That night, thirty aircraft from the 3rd Bombardment Group and nearly that many aircraft from the 17th Bombardment Group bombed Yongyu City. On that occasion, we dropped four germ bombs.

    On the night of July 24, 1952, while on a mission over Sinchon, my aircraft encountered a severe storm that made it impossible for us to control the aircraft. We were forced to parachute out, and only Corporal McCann and I survived. The next day, we were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    After we were captured, we were surprised by the generous treatment given to us by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    As they moved us from one place to another, we saw the extensive damage inflicted on Pyongyang and other cities in North Korea. I began to experience a feeling of guilt. I knew we were conducting germ warfare, but now that I had the opportunity to learn about the terrible consequences it caused, I couldn't even sleep soundly.

    The above pages are my full confession. If those who judge me will grant me forgiveness, I hope that I will become a better citizen of the United States and the world. I hope I can do something valuable for peace. Robert C. Ruyle (signature) Lieutenant, U.S. Air Force Service Number A O—929157 September 1, 1952

    美国空军第三轰炸机联队第三轰炸机大队第十三轰炸机中队领航员中尉劳勃脱·卡·鲁利的供词
    我，劳勃脱·卡尔·鲁利，一九一六年七月一日生于美国伊利诺斯州芝加哥城。我的家现在美国加利福尼亚州洛杉矶。我在一九四二年八月参加美国空军，一九四四年被派赴太平洋战区，直至一九四六年五月才回美国，那时即从空军退役，恢复平民生活。一九五一年十月，我被重召入伍。我于一九五二年五月离开美国赴朝鲜，并于一九五二年六月一日抵达朝鲜群山K —8基地。我被指派至第三轰炸机联队第三轰炸机大队第十三轰炸机中队为领航员。
    约在一九五二年六月十二日，我被通知向大队作战科报到，到大队简令室去听一次特别情报课。约有二十个驾驶员和领航员参加了此次听课。讲课人为卡斯派兹克上尉。他说，上课的目的是使我们熟悉一种细菌弹和某些必要的手续，以便在作战时能够安全地使用它。
    他首先陈示了该弹的一个木制模型，大小好像一枚五百磅的普通炸弹。该弹共有四格，每格内可装染菌昆虫。每一格都有一扇可为一根螺旋杆打开的门。这根螺旋杆纵贯细菌弹的内部，并与弹尾的螺旋桨相连。在该弹被投下来的时候，弹尾的螺旋桨每秒钟旋转许多圈数，这样，到了一定的高度，这扇门便被打开了。该弹头部有一信管，于撞击地面时将弹壳炸毁。
    他说，为了避免在南朝鲜有引起瘟疫的一切可能，在发生事故时必须采取下列紧急措施。例如一架带着细菌弹的飞机，在起飞时引擎发生故障，而驾驶员又无法在跑道上将飞机煞住，那么他就应该把飞机驶入跑道西端的黄海里，或驶入跑道东端的蓄水池里。假如绝对无法把细菌弹投在北朝鲜，而在归返基地的途中又有一丝可能会发生某种事故，那么我们就应该把飞机驶向大海，然后跳伞。
      我问卡斯派兹克上尉，在K—8 基地是否有这种细菌弹，他说有。他说，还有其他类型的细菌弹，但与我们有关的仅是这一种类型。
    约在一九五二年六月十四日，我第一次接触到细菌弹。那天，我和我的驾驶员勒罗伊·派克中尉被指定飞行一次“特殊任务”。卡斯派兹克上尉在传达了一般的命令后说：所有指定飞行特殊任务的机组留下来听特殊简令。他在传达特殊简令时告诉我们：我们带的是细菌弹，我们不会看到爆炸。他继而重复了他在讲解细菌弹时已经说过的、关于发生事故时所应采取的紧急措施，并告诉我们将细菌弹投在阳德。
    当我与派克去检查飞机时，我发现那些弹与以前见过的模型一模一样，一共两枚，系用金属制成，不像模型是用木制的。
    我们按时起飞，把细菌弹投于指定的目标。细菌弹离开飞机以后，我们什么也没有看到。我们沿着指定的路线巡逻后，约于一时四十五分返回基地。我向汇报官所做的关于细菌弹的汇报是：“投弹于指定目标，观察不明。”
    此后，我与派克中尉又一同执行了六次投细菌弹的任务。
    约在六月十六日，我们在黄州投了两枚细菌弹。
    约在六月十九日，我们在镇南浦以东约十英里的兼二浦投了两枚细菌弹。
    约在六月二十二日，我们在中和投了两枚细菌弹。天气很暗，局部有云，投弹稍偏于目标之南。
    约在六月二十五日，我们在新溪投了两枚细菌弹。我们降低了高度，试试能否看到什么，但我们的飞机却被高射炮火打了四个洞。
    约在七月八日，我们在遂安投了两枚细菌弹。
    我最后一次的细菌任务约在七月十七日。那天晚上，第三轰炸机大队的三十架飞机和第十七轰炸机大队的近乎此数的飞机轰炸了永柔城。那一次，我们投了四枚细菌弹。
    一九五二年七月二十四日晚，当我在信川上空执行任务时，我的飞机遇到剧烈的风暴，使我们不能控制飞机。我们被迫跳伞，同机人员中，只有我与麦堪尼下士活着出来。次日，我们为中国人民志愿军俘获。
    我们被俘后，中国人民志愿军给我们的宽大待遇使我们感到惊奇。
    当他们把我们自一处迁移至另一处的时候，我们看到了平壤以及北朝鲜其他城市所受到的重大破坏。我开始体验到一种犯了罪的感觉。我原来知道我们在进行着细菌战，但是，现在当我有了机会阅悉关于它所造成的可怖后果时，我甚至不能安睡了。
    以上各页是我的全部供词。倘使审判我的人对我加以宽恕，我希望我将会成为美国和世界的一个更好的公民。我希望我能为和平做些有价值的事情。劳勃脱·卡·鲁利（签名）美国空军中尉军号A O—929157一九五二年九月一日（新华社）（附图片）
