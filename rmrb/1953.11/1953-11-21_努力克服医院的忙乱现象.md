    Short Commentary:

    Today, this newspaper publishes the preliminary experiences of Beijing hospitals in overcoming the busy and chaotic phenomenon, which deserves the attention of hospitals in various regions. The phenomenon of crowded and chaotic outpatient clinics in urban hospitals is quite common and serious. Generally, hospitals feel that their work is too heavy and their efficiency is too low; as for patients, they are quite dissatisfied with hospitals because of the long time spent on registration, waiting for consultations, and obtaining medication, and the inability to obtain timely treatment and sufficient diagnostic time. The emergence of this phenomenon is due, on the one hand, to the improvement of people's material living standards and cultural levels, and the continuous growth of their demands for medical and health services, while the cultivation of medical and health personnel and the development of medical institutions are far from meeting the needs of the people; on the other hand, it is because some medical workers, especially the leading comrades of certain medical institutions, one-sidedly emphasize the contradiction between the supply and demand of medical services, and believe that this contradiction cannot be overcome without increasing cadres, increasing equipment, and increasing labor intensity. The preliminary experience of Beijing hospitals in overcoming the busy and chaotic phenomenon proves that this idea is wrong.
    The experience of Beijing in improving hospital work tells us that general hospitals have potential strength. Under the slogan of "facilitating patients, tapping potential, and improving work efficiency," Beijing hospitals mobilized the masses, conducted research, and tapped potential strength. As a result, the crowded outpatient clinics, chaos, and difficulty in hospitalization in various hospitals have indeed been changed to some extent. It can be seen that the supply and demand imbalance in medical care is not the only reason for the emergence of crowded and chaotic outpatient clinics in urban hospitals. As long as the hospital leaders are good at mobilizing the masses, pooling everyone's wisdom, improving various systems, and making every effort to tap potential, the busy and chaotic phenomenon in hospitals is not completely insurmountable.
    Doing a good job in the medical and preventive work of hospitals is the main work of health administrative departments, and it is extremely closely related to the broad masses of the people. In particular, hospital outpatient work is an important link in hospital work. Therefore, the health leading organs of various cities must attach importance to this work, strengthen the leadership of hospital work, and make it continuously improve the system, tap potential, and improve work efficiency. This is not only of great significance to the current campaign to increase production and practice economy, but also a good political education for medical workers.

### 努力克服医院的忙乱现象

    努力克服医院的忙乱现象
    今天本报发表了北京市医院克服忙乱现象的初步经验，值得各地医院的重视。各城市医院门诊拥挤忙乱的现象是相当普遍而严重的。一般医院都感到工作过于繁重，效率太低；至于病人，因为挂号、候诊、取药时间长，得不到及时治疗和充分诊断时间，则对医院颇为不满。这种现象的产生，一方面是因为人民的物质生活和文化水平提高了，对医药卫生的要求不断增长，而医药卫生人材的培养和医疗机构的发展还远不能满足人民的需要；而另一方面则是因为有些医务工作者，特别是某些医疗机构的领导同志，片面地强调医疗上供不应求的矛盾，认为不增加干部，不增加设备，不提高劳动强度，这种矛盾是不能克服的。北京市医院克服忙乱现象的初步经验，证明了这种想法是不对的。
    北京市改进医院工作的经验告诉我们，一般医院都是有着潜在力量的。北京市各医院在“便利病人，挖掘潜力，提高工作效率”的口号下，发动了群众，进行了研究，挖掘了潜在力量，结果各医院门诊拥挤，忙乱和住院困难的状况确已有所改变。由此可见城市医院门诊拥挤、忙乱现象之所以产生，医疗上的供不应求，并不是唯一的原因。只要医院领导同志善于发动群众，集中大家的智慧，改进各方面的制度，尽量挖掘潜力，医院的忙乱现象，不是完全不能克服的。
    搞好医院的医疗预防工作，是卫生行政部门的主要工作，它和广大人民群众的关系极为密切。特别是医院门诊工作，乃是医院工作中的重要环节。因此各城市的卫生领导机关，必须重视这一工作，加强对医院工作的领导，使之不断改进制度，挖掘潜力，提高工作效能。这不仅对目前开展增产节约运动有极大意义，而且对医务工作者也是一个很好的政治教育。
