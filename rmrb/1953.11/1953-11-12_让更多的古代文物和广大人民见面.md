    Let More Ancient Cultural Relics Meet the Broad Masses of the People
    Sun Dawei from the Qingchengzi Lead Mine Office, Liaoning Province, writes: Our country's ancient cultural heritage is very rich. These magnificent cultural relics and artworks not only demonstrate the creative wisdom of the Chinese working people, but also educate us and future generations to love our great motherland and correctly understand the history of our country. In the past, many of our country's precious and rare ancient cultural relics suffered destruction and theft by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, which fills us with infinite resentment. There are also many cultural relics scattered among the people. Today, in the people's own country, if these treasured cultural relics from past dynasties can become national public property for the broad working masses to admire and observe, they will obviously have greater value than if they are scattered and kept by private individuals.
    The People's Daily published on October 11th that Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, donated his "Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms" scrolls, which he had painstakingly collected for decades, to the country. This is very good. I suggest that people from all walks of life who treasure ancient cultural relics of our motherland let more ancient cultural relics meet the broad masses of the people, so that the glorious and splendid cultural heritage of our great motherland can play a greater role.

    让更多的古代文物和广大人民见面
    辽东省青城子铅矿办公室孙大为来信：我国古代的文化遗产非常丰富。这些辉煌灿烂的文物与艺术作品，不但表现了中国劳动人民的创造智慧，而且还教育我们和后代子孙热爱自己伟大的祖国和正确地认识祖国的历史。我国的不少珍贵稀世的古代文物，过去遭受帝国主义、国民党反动派的破坏和盗窃，使我们感到无限的愤恨。还有许多文物则散在民间。在今天人民自己的国家，这些历代珍藏的文物如果能够成为国家的公共财产，供广大劳动人民欣赏、观摩，比起分散地由私人保管显然有更大的价值。
    人民日报十月十一日刊载：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会陈叔通副主席将他几十年来苦心收藏的“百家画梅”画幅捐献给国家，这是很好的。我建议珍藏祖国古代文物的社会各界人士让更多的古代文物和广大人民见面，使我们伟大祖国的辉煌灿烂的文化遗产发挥更大的作用。
