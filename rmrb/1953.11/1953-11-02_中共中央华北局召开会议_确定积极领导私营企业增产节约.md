    CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Convenes Meeting
    Determining Active Leadership in Private Enterprise Production Increase and Thrift
   [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau specially convened a meeting on October 21st and 22nd to examine the leadership of the North China city Party committees over private enterprises in the past six months, and the progress of the production increase and thrift campaign in various private enterprises.
    After listening to reports from various local Party committees on the leadership of private enterprise work, the meeting believed that the labor competition carried out in some private enterprises in various large and small cities in North China in the past six months is an effective method to transform private enterprises and further enable them to play a role in the people's economy. The labor competition in Tianjin's private enterprises began early on with typical experiments in some factories. By September, 473 private factories had participated in the competition, and generally good results of varying degrees had been achieved in the competition. The knitting yarn target of Renli Woolen Mill has increased from 96 percent to 100 percent. Further expansion of the production increase and thrift campaign in the fourth quarter is planned to increase production by 5.4 billion yuan. More than 53 percent of the private factories in Tianjin's Eighth District hardware industry have increased their quotas in the competition. Shoufeng Flour Mill increased flour output in the competition, increasing flour production for the state by 150,000 jin in one month. After the launch of the competition at the Beijing Chunshengxiang Dyeing Factory, the rate of defective cloth decreased by 56 percent. In addition, the production efficiency of three other dyeing factories increased by 15 percent, and the rate of defective cloth decreased by 59.6 percent. Due to the reduction in costs in the competition at Tangshan Jianhua Pottery Factory, the selling price of 48 products was reduced.
    The competition movement has also promoted the improvement of business management in private enterprises, resulting in improved product quality and reduced costs. For example, after private enterprises in Tangshan held a waste product exhibition and convened a technical personnel research meeting with the help of the People's Government, the damage rate of products at the Lianda Iron Factory decreased from 9 percent to 1.4 percent; the percentage of first-class products at Dahe Pottery Factory increased from 70.4 percent before the competition to 80.8 percent; after eight ceramic enterprises consulted with labor and management to abolish unreasonable systems, the production efficiency of workers also increased by 38.8 percent.
    The meeting conducted a detailed discussion on how to continue strengthening leadership over private enterprises on the existing basis and further expand the production increase and thrift campaign. The meeting believes that the principle of carrying out labor competition in all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood must be affirmed. Through active leadership of the competition, the vast number of workers and technicians should be mobilized to promote and unite capitalists, actively improve business management, improve quality, reduce costs, increase equipment utilization and labor productivity, and on this basis, further implement the policy of benefiting both labor and management and taking into account both public and private interests, strengthen supervision of private enterprises, and bring them into the orbit of national planning. For the balance of production, supply, and sales, and for the problems of low quality, high costs, and poor working conditions of employees that currently exist in many private enterprises, various different methods should be adopted to solve them according to specific circumstances. The labor-management consultation method adopted in Tianjin, Tangshan and other places can be promoted in various regions.
    Finally, Liu Xiufeng, the Third Deputy Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, made a summary of the meeting. He pointed out that all cadres must deeply recognize that the state's policy towards private industry and commerce is to utilize its aspects that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, restrict its aspects that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and carry out socialist transformation of them in a planned and step-by-step manner. Leading the production increase and thrift campaign in private enterprises must firmly grasp this principle. To this end, a detailed investigation and analysis of the production, supply, and sales of various industries must be carried out, because this is the key to understanding whether certain enterprises are beneficial to the national

    中共中央华北局召开会议
    确定积极领导私营企业增产节约
   【新华社一日讯】中共中央华北局在十月二十一、二十二两日专门召开会议，检查半年来华北各城市党委对私营企业的领导，和各私营企业增产节约竞赛开展的情况。
    会议在听取了各地党委对私营企业工作的领导情形后，认为半年来华北各大小城市在部分私营企业中所开展的劳动竞赛，是改造私营企业，使之在人民经济生活中进一步发生作用的有效方法。天津市私营企业的劳动竞赛很早就开始在部分工厂里作典型试验，到九月份止，参加竞赛的私营工厂已有四百七十三家，并普遍在竞赛中收到不同程度的良好效果。仁立毛织厂编织线指标已由百分之九十六提高到百分之百，第四季度进一步开展增产节约竞赛，计划增产五十四亿元。天津市八区五金业百分之五十三以上的私营厂都在竞赛中提高了定额。寿丰面粉厂竞赛中提高出粉率，一个月为国家增产面粉十五万斤。北京市春生祥染厂展开竞赛后，次布率降低了百分之五十六，另有三户染厂生产效率提高百分之十五，次布率降低百分之五十九点六。唐山市建华窑业厂由于在竞赛中成本降低，有四十八种产品降低了售价。
    竞赛运动还推动了私营企业改进经营管理，使产品质量提高，成本降低。如唐山市各私营企业在人民政府帮助下举办了废品展览会，召开了技术人员研究会以后，联大铁厂的产品破损率由百分之九降低到百分之一点四；大和窑业厂甲等品由竞赛前的百分之七十点四提高到百分之八十点八；八家陶瓷业经劳资协商取消了不合理的制度，工人生产效率也提高了百分之三十八点八。
    会议对于如何在现有基础上继续加强对私营企营领导，进一步开展增产节约竞赛的问题作了详尽的讨论。会议认为今后在一切有利于国计民生的私营企业中开展劳动竞赛的原则必须肯定下来，要通过对竞赛的积极领导，发动广大职工和技术人员推动和团结资本家，积极改进经营管理，提高质量，降低成本，提高设备利用率和劳动生产率，并在这一基础上，进一步贯彻劳资两利和公私兼顾的政策，加强对私营企业的监督，并使之纳入国家计划的轨道。对于产供销的平衡问题，对于不少私营企业目前存在质量低、成本高、职工劳动条件差等问题，要按照具体情况，采取各种不同的方法解决。天津、唐山等地所采取的劳资协商方式，各地可以推广。
    会议最后由中共中央华北局第三副书记刘秀峰作总结。他指出必须使全体干部深刻认识到，国家对于私营工商业的政策，是利用其有利于国计民生的方面，限制其不利于国计民生的方面，并有计划有步骤地对它们进行社会主义改造。领导私营企业增产节约竞赛，必须紧紧地掌握这个原则。为此就必须对各行业的产、供、销情况做详细的调查和分析，因为这是了解某些企业是否有利国计民生和确定是否开展竞赛的关键。他还指出：竞赛中要发挥国营经济对私营企业的领导和监督作用，对于不同情况的企业，在竞赛中要有不同的要求，对于加工订货的企业要求做到保质、保量、保证到期交货，防止重犯
  “五毒”。一般企业应以提高质量，降低成本为竞赛的主要要求。制订增产计划时，必须遵照整个国民经济发展的需要和可能条件，切防盲目增产，造成国家资财的损失。增产节约的成果，不但要使国家人民有利，使工人得到好处，并要使资方的利润也有所增加。只有这样才能把竞赛搞好，使私营企业得到改造，逐渐走向国家资本主义的道路。
    为贯彻此次会议的精神，并推动全区私营企业竞赛普遍开展，会议决定省、市以上的城市党委统
  一战线工作部，要与各有关单位联合成立私营企业增产节约委员会及办公室，以加强对竞赛的领导。
