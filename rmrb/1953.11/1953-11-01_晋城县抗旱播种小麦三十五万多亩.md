    Jincheng County Plants Over 350,000 Mu of Wheat Despite Drought
    During the wheat planting season, Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, experienced a severe drought. Farmers began to rely on heaven for rain, and some district and township cadres were busy leading farmers in autumn harvest appraisals and applying additional or supplementary fertilizer, neglecting drought-resistant wheat planting. From September 10th, when wheat planting began, only a little over 50,000 mu had been planted by the 17th.
    The Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jincheng County People's Government promptly elevated drought-resistant wheat planting to the top priority of all work in the county, calling on farmers to "mobilize urgently, overcome the drought, and complete the wheat planting task." They swiftly adopted various measures, convening mobilization meetings for drought-resistant planting at the county, district, and township levels to reverse the cadres' paralysis and discuss drought-resistant planting methods. More than a hundred cadres were organized to go to the villages to assist in drought-resistant planting.
    Through small-scale forums and family meetings, the people eliminated the farmers' ideas of "relying on heaven for rain" and concerns about "the ground is too dry to plow." Peasants were mobilized to make maximum use of spring water, stream water, and cisterns to water the ground for planting. The farmers also came up with many ways to plant wheat despite the drought, such as using tiered water lifting to raise water from low-lying areas to higher ground, expanding the irrigated area. In Bagong Village, District Two, the land prepared for wheat planting was completely dry, but much of the land reserved for plowing in the coming spring could be planted. The farmers in this village converted this land to wheat cultivation.
    Thanks to the adoption of various measures and the timely dissemination of experience, from September 18th to October 15th, 350,000 mu of the county's more than 430,000 mu of wheat fields have been planted. (Ma Guoliang, Wang Lieyi)

    晋城县抗旱播种小麦三十五万多亩
    山西省晋城县在播种小麦时期，旱象严重，农民产生了靠天等雨思想，某些区、乡干部忙于领导农民秋收评比、补肥、追肥，忽视了抗旱种麦，从九月十日开始种麦，到十七日全县才下种了五万多亩。
    中共晋城县委会和晋城县人民政府及时将抗旱种麦提到全县一切工作的首要位置，号召农民“紧急动员起来，战胜旱灾，完成小麦播种任务”，并迅速采取了各项措施，召开县、区、乡三级干部抗旱播种动员大会，扭转干部的麻痹思想，讨论了抗旱下种办法，并组织百余名干部下乡帮助抗旱播种工作。
    各地通过小型座谈会、家庭会议等形式，消除了农民“靠天等雨”的思想和“地干、犁不动”等顾虑，发动农民尽量利用泉水、涧水和水窖蓄水浇地下种。农民们也想出了许多抗旱种麦的办法，如使用分层提水，使低地的水提到高处，扩大了浇地面积。二区巴公村准备种麦的地已经干透，但许多留待明年春季耕种的地可以下种，这村的农民就将这些地改种了小麦。
    由于采取了各种措施，及时传播经验，从九月十八日到十月十五日，全县四十三万多亩麦田，已播种了三十五万多亩。（马国良、王烈毅）
