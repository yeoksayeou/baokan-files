Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: The Vietnam News Agency reports that the Vietnamese People's Army recently annihilated a puppet army light infantry battalion in the eastern part of the Bui Chu area of Nam Dinh province. On October 25th, the People's Army attacked a puppet army light infantry battalion moving from Ngo Dong towards the sandbar ten kilometers east of Bui Chu, wiping out most of the battalion and capturing a large number of weapons and ammunition. The morale of the puppet army is very low, and many people are frightened and flee at the sound of gunfire from the People's Army. According to captured enemy soldiers, many puppet soldiers disobey orders and refuse to fight.

    The General Command of the People's Army pointed out in a communiqué: Since the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated the puppet army's 703rd and 707th light infantry battalions at Van Ly, south of Bui Chu, on October 18th, Navarre, Commander-in-Chief of the French invading forces in Indochina, hastily withdrew all the puppet army light infantry units in Giao Thuy and Hai Hau districts of Nam Dinh province to avoid being annihilated. However, within a week, they lost nearly another battalion. At the same time, on the left bank of the Red River in Hung Yen and Thai Binh provinces, the local forces and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army also took the initiative to attack, causing heavy losses to the enemy. On October 20th, the local forces of the People's Army in Hung Yen province attacked the enemy stronghold in Cong Lun, wiping out an enemy platoon and capturing all the weapons and ammunition. The guerrillas in Thai Binh province closely surrounded the two enemy strongholds on Highway 39 between the provincial capital of Thai Binh and Qianhai County - Sha Qiao and Qing Ni. The enemy is now forced to use aircraft to transport food and ammunition to supply these two strongholds.

    越南人民军又在裴朱地区击溃伪军一个营
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军最近又在南定省裴朱地区东部击溃一个伪军轻装营。十月二十五日，人民军对正从吴同向裴朱以东十公里的沙洲移动的一个伪军轻装营进行袭击，歼灭该营大部，缴获大批武器、弹药。伪军士气非常低落，许多人一听到人民军的枪声就吓得逃跑。据被俘的敌军说，很多伪军不服从命令并拒绝作战。
    人民军总司令部的公报指出：自十月十八日越南人民军在裴朱以南的文里歼灭伪军第七○三、第七○七两个轻装营以后，印度支那法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔就慌忙把在南定省交水和海后两县的伪军轻装部队全部撤出，以免被歼。但是在一星期后又损失了近一个营。同时，在红河左岸兴安、太平两省，越南人民军地方部队和游击队也主动出击，使敌军遭受很大损失。十月二十日，兴安省的人民军地方部队进攻了贡仑的敌军据点，歼灭敌军一个排并缴获了全部武器和弹药。太平省的游击队紧紧包围了太平省会和钱海县之间的第三十九号公路上的两个敌军据点——沙桥、清尼。现在敌军被迫用飞机运输粮食、弹药来供应这两个据点。
