Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st -- The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission notified the Korean-Chinese side on the evening of the 1st that explanation work would be suspended on the 2nd, but did not state the reason.

The 1st was Sunday, and according to the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," no explanation work was to be carried out. On the morning of the 1st, the Korean-Chinese side submitted the work plan for explaining to the Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 48 on the 2nd to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Camp 48 is the camp that the Korean-Chinese side proposed to conduct explanations in on October 16th.

Since the start of the explanation work on the 15th of last month, the Korean-Chinese side has only carried out fifteen hours of explanation work in total, which is less than two explanation days.

Past facts have shown that the Li-Jiang special agents are implementing their counter-explanation plan entirely according to the US side's instructions. If the US side believes that the special agents in a certain camp have prepared the counter-explanation work properly, they will designate this camp to listen to the explanations, and the special agents will let the prisoners of war out of the camp; if the US side believes that the counter-explanation work in a certain camp has not been prepared properly and needs the special agents to buy time to control the prisoners of war, they will force the explanation work to stop completely.

    朝中方面今天又被迫不能进行解释工作
    显然是因为美方特务还没有完成反解释的准备工作
    【新华社开城一日电】中立国遣返委员会在一日晚上通知朝中方面说，二日解释工作停止进行，但未说明原因。
    一日是星期日，按照“解释和访问工作细则”规定，不进行解释工作。一日上午朝中方面就将二日对四十八号营场朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的工作计划提交中立国遣返委员会。四十八号营场就是十月十六日朝中方面提出要进行解释的营场。
    从上月十五日解释工作开始以来，朝中方面一共只进行了十五个小时的解释工作，连两个解释日也不到。
    过去的事实说明，李蒋特务完全是按照美方的指挥实施其反解释计划的。如果美方认为某个营场中的特务已经将反解释工作准备妥当，他们就指定这个营场听解释，特务就让战俘出营场；如果美方认为某个营场的反解释工作还没有准备妥当，要特务争取时间控制战俘，他们就迫使解释工作完全停止。
