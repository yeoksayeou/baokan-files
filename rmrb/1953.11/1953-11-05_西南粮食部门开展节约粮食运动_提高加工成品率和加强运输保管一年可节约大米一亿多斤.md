Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 4th: Grain departments at all levels in the Southwest region are launching a grain conservation campaign by improving grain processing yields and strengthening grain storage and transportation. According to preliminary calculations by local grain departments, these two efforts could save the region 142.22 million jin of rice annually. Based on an average annual consumption of 365 jin per person, this amount of rice could feed approximately 380,000 people for a year.

The Southwest Grain Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Food, in order to ensure that grain departments at all levels effectively avoid grain waste, held a grain processing symposium in mid-October to inspect the rice processing situation in various provinces. The inspection revealed extremely inconsistent processing standards across provinces, with excessively high rice processing precision causing loss of nutritional components and low processing yields, resulting in significant grain waste. For example, the Guiyang City Grain Department wasted 1.23 million jin of rice from January to June alone this year by processing large quantities of cooked rice into refined machine-milled rice for sale. Representatives from various provinces have initially decided, based on the current situation, to increase the finished product yield by 1.5 to 2 jin per 100 jin of unhusked rice. The amount of grain saved will greatly increase as processing techniques are continuously improved in various regions.

The Southwest Grain Administration Bureau has studied the losses incurred in grain storage, transportation, and transfer in various regions over the years. Due to the humid climate in the Southwest, grain mold is relatively common, and damage from pests and rodents is quite severe. The Southwest Grain Administration Bureau has now formulated improved measures for storage and transportation, and strengthened warehouse inspection systems and methods. After these measures are effectively implemented, it is estimated that the Southwest region can reduce grain losses by more than 35.28 million jin annually.

Employees of local grain departments are highly enthusiastic about saving grain, and many regions have developed individual work plans for grain conservation. Various regions have also launched warehouse safety inspections, renovations, and cleaning and disinfection efforts. Grain departments in Luzhou and Wenjiang in Sichuan Province, Guiding and Bijie in Guizhou Province, and Yuxi in Yunnan Province have organized work teams to assist in inspecting warehouse disinfection work in various regions. Currently, grain processing departments in various regions have begun to reduce processing precision. The Chongqing Grain Department has recently saved 1 million jin of grain in rice processing.

    西南粮食部门开展节约粮食运动
    提高加工成品率和加强运输保管一年可节约大米一亿多斤
    【新华社重庆四日电】西南区各级粮食部门从提高粮食加工成品率和加强粮食的保管运输工作方面，开展节约粮食运动。根据各地粮食部门初步计算，从以上两方面的工作，全区一年内可节约大米一亿四千二百二十多万斤，若按平均每人每年食用三百六十五斤计算，这些米大约可供三十八万多人食用一年。
    中央粮食部西南粮食管理局为使各级粮食部门切实避免粮食的浪费，曾在十月中旬召开粮食加工座谈会，检查了各省大米加工情况。经检查发现各省加工标准极不统一，加工大米精度很高，大米中的营养成分受到损失，加工成品率很低的结果，浪费粮食的数字很大，如贵阳市粮食部门在今年用大量熟米加工成精白机米出售，仅一月到六月即浪费大米一百二十三万斤。各省代表根据目前情况初步决定每百斤黄谷提高成品率一斤半到两斤。各地在不断改进加工技术中节约粮食的数字将大大增加。
    西南粮食管理局研究了历年各地粮食保管、调运中的损耗情况。由于西南气候潮湿，粮食霉烂情况比较普遍，虫害、鼠食相当严重。西南粮食管理局现已订出改进保管、运输工作，加强仓库检查制度和办法。这些办法切实实行以后，据初步估计，每年西南区可减少损耗粮食三千五百二十八万多斤。
    各地粮食部门职工对节约粮食的热情很高，许多地区职工已制订出个人节约粮食的工作计划。各地并展开了仓库的安全检查、整修和清洁消毒等工作。四川省的泸州、温江，贵州省的贵定、毕节，云南省的玉溪等专区粮食部门，都组织了工作组到各地协助检查仓库消毒工作。目前，各地粮食加工部门已开始降低加工精度。重庆市粮食部门最近在加工大米中已节约了一百万斤粮食。
