Welcoming Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean Government Delegation

    Kim Il-sung's Name Inspires Us to Move Forward
    Hu Changbai, Former Student of the "Kim Il-sung Class" at Beijing Municipal No. 25 Middle School
    When the newspaper published the news of Marshal Kim Il-sung's visit to our country as a headline, how could my heart not be stirred? It took me a long time to say just one sentence: "Great, Marshal Kim Il-sung, you have come!"
    I remember when I was in my third year at Beijing Municipal No. 25 Middle School, the school transferred the glorious title of "Kim Il-sung Class" to us. At the transfer ceremony, we swore an oath: to guarantee that in future study, life, and various sports, we would maintain the glorious title of the Kim Il-sung Class and resolutely be good students of Marshal Kim Il-sung. From that time on, we have been moving forward under the care and encouragement of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean people. Our class once received a letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung, the "Forward Report" sent by the People's Army, and apples and picture albums sent by the Korean people. Once, when Marshal Kim Il-sung didn't have time to reply to us, he specially entrusted comrades from the Korean Embassy in China to convey his concern to us: "How are the students of the Kim Il-sung Class studying?" What great strength that sentence brought us! Luo Yuming came from Guangzhou and had never studied analytic geometry before. He only focused on catching up with analytic geometry and relaxed his physics studies. At the beginning, his average physics test score was only in the fifties. But we must not let down the glorious title of the Kim Il-sung Class! Everyone came to help him, and he himself worked very hard, and as a result, he achieved a score of over ninety. Although our homework was better than other classes, we could only complete about 60 percent. Our guarantee was: to complete 100 percent. In the end, we achieved it, and the class's average academic score for the first quarter reached 81.6. Take physical exercise for example. Our class's past performance was always below fifth place. Zhang Cunji is a very tall young lad, but his weight was less than 50 kilograms, and he could only lift a maximum weight of 50 pounds. He knew that as a member of the Kim Il-sung Class, he should not only study well, but also be in good health. He seized all the time outside of class to exercise himself, and as a result, he could lift 100 pounds. The same was true for all the students in the class. In the spring sports review meeting held in the second semester of the third year, our overall sports performance was the first in the school. All our achievements are inseparable from the inspiration of the great name of Kim Il-sung. We wrote all these achievements in a letter to him and promised him: "In the future, we will study even more diligently and become useful talents for the construction of the motherland."
    Now, we have all completed the high school stage of study and have embarked on new learning and work posts. Although we have left the Kim Il-sung Class, the name of Kim Il-sung will forever inspire us to move forward. I am now studying at the Beijing Russian Language Institute. Russian is a relatively complex language, but I have full determination and confidence to learn it well and train myself into a well-rounded talent to contribute to the great construction of the motherland. If necessary and possible, I am willing to go to Korea to help the Korean people rebuild their homes!

### 金日成的名字鼓舞我们前进

专栏：欢迎金日成元帅和朝鲜政府代表团

    金日成的名字鼓舞我们前进
    北京市立第二十五中学前“金日成班”学生  胡长柏
    报纸上以头条新闻刊登着金日成元帅访问我国的消息，我的心里怎么能不激动呢？半天才说了一句话：“伟大啊，金日成元帅，您可来了！”
    记得在北京市立二十五中读高三的时候，上班就把“金日成班”的光荣称号转授给我们。在举行转班仪式时，我们宣誓：保证在今后的学习生活及各种运动中，保持金日成班的光荣称号，坚决做金日成元帅的好学生。从那时候起，我们就在金日成元帅和朝鲜人民的关怀和鼓舞下前进着。我们班上曾接到过金日成元帅的来信，人民军寄来的“前进报”、朝鲜人民寄来的苹果和画册。有一次，金日成元帅没有时间给我们回信，特委托朝鲜驻华大使馆的同志把他的关怀告诉我们：“金日成班的学生学习得怎么样？”这句话给我们带来了多大的力量啊！罗裕明是从广州来的，过去没有学习过解析几何，只顾赶解析几何，就放松了物理的学习。开始物理考试时成绩平均只五十多分。但是我们决不能辜负金日成班的光荣称号呀！大家都来帮助他，他自己也很努力，结果就达到了九十多分。课外作业，我们虽然比别的班都好些，也只能完成百分之六十。我们的保证是：要完成百分之百。结果都实现了，全班第一季度的学业平均分数达到了八十一点六。又比如体格锻炼吧，我们班上过去的成绩总是在第五名以下。张存济是一个很高的年轻小伙子，但体重还不到五十公斤，顶多能举五十磅的重量。他知道做为一个金日成班的成员，不但应当学习好，而且还应当身体好。他抓住一切课外时间来锻炼自己，结果就能举一百磅的重量。全班的同学也是一样，在高三第二学期全校举行的春季体育检阅大会上，我们的体育总成绩是全校的第一名了。一切成绩，都离不开金日成这个伟大名字的鼓舞，我们把这些成绩都写信告诉了他，并向他保证：“今后要加倍顽强地学习，成为建设祖国有用的人才。”
    现在，我们都完成了高中的学习阶段，走上了新的学习和工作岗位。虽然我们已经离开了金日成班，可是金日成的名字将永远鼓舞着我们前进。我现在已经到北京俄文专修学校学习，俄文，是一种比较复杂的文字，但是我有充分的决心和信心来学好它，并把自己锻炼成一个健全的人才，为祖国的伟大建设贡献力量。如果必要和可能时，我愿到朝鲜去帮助朝鲜人民重建家园！
