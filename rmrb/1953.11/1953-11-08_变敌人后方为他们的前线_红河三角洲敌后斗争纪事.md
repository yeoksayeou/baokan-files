Turning the Enemy's Rear into Their Frontline
— A Chronicle of Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines in the Red River Delta

Before us is a map illustrating the situation of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam.

The French invading forces used a long line of bunkers to separate the Red River Delta from the liberated areas of northern Vietnam. Now, on this map of the Red River Delta, encircled by the enemy's bunkers, we can see: interconnected red and light red areas, with red lines pointing towards the enemy-occupied large cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and some important strongholds and transportation lines. These are the guerrilla bases and guerrilla areas behind enemy lines that are causing the French invading forces a great deal of trouble.

This situation began to form in early 1952. At that time, following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh: "The enemy's attack on Hoa Binh (place name) is a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy," and "Turn the enemy's rear into their front," the headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army took advantage of the French invading forces' deployment of a large number of mobile troops to attack Hoa Binh Province in the northern Vietnam liberated area, sending several main force units to quickly penetrate the Red River Delta, coordinating with the cadres, local forces, and guerrillas who persisted there, traversing the enemy's rear, moving freely back and forth. In less than two months, more than a thousand enemy strongholds were removed, and the puppet regime was crushed county by county and district by district, liberating large areas of land on the left bank, right bank, and middle reaches of the Red River. The guerrilla bases that had been reduced in the autumn and winter of 1949 were mostly restored, powerfully coordinating with the operations on the main battlefield, putting the invading forces attacking the liberated areas in a position of being attacked from both the front and the rear, and achieving a brilliant victory in the Hoa Binh campaign. The initiative on the northern Vietnam battlefield has since fallen into the hands of the Vietnam People's Army.

The former commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in North Vietnam and Upper Laos, De Linar, had to admit annoyedly in his June 1952 "Instructions on Pacification Work in the Northern Plain": "Our plan has been disrupted by the Viet Minh! Our army is dominated by the Viet Minh!" He said: "In the military aspect, due to the difficulties caused by the Viet Minh, the activities of our army are always dispersed. The same is true in the political aspect, all forces have to be dispersed in various places, and as a result, pacification work cannot be well implemented in any area."

In order to salvage the defeat and change this passive situation of being beaten, the headquarters of the French invading forces withdrew many mobile troops back to the Red River Delta, and concentrated absolutely superior forces in a very small area, conducting repeated "sweeps" for as long as three or four months, in order to achieve the purpose of breaking the Vietnam People's guerrilla bases and guerrilla areas behind enemy lines one by one and realizing its "pacification of the northern plain." But the Vietnamese people's armed forces have already gained a firm foothold. No matter what means the French invaders use, they cannot pull the situation in the Red River Delta back to what it was before the Hoa Binh campaign.

Today, the situation behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta is: the French invading forces are constantly contained here with a total of 112 garrison battalions and mobile battalions, accounting for one-half of the total French invading forces in Vietnam. The guerrilla bases, in frequent, tense, and arduous counter-"sweeps," have not only been consolidated, but are also constantly expanding. From June 1952 to June 1953, another 44 villages and 894 hamlets of land were liberated.

Not long ago, the headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army announced the battle results of the battlefield behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta in the past year: from July 1952 to July 1953, the local troops and guerrillas and militia of the People's Army took the initiative to fight 5,070 times, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 52,000 enemy troops; removing and forcing the enemy to withdraw from 262 strongholds; and seizing a large number of various weapons. This outstanding battle of the Vietnamese people dealt another heavy blow to the French invaders, who have consistently boasted of "striving to consolidate the rear, thoroughly pacify the plain, and cut off the main source of supply for the communists."

The French colonialists will never understand how much great strength is contained in these liberated lands behind their rear. This strength, condensed from the blood and tears of millions of people, is unconquerable. Among the people in the Nam Dinh Province area on the right bank of the Red River, there is still a saying circulating to this day: "Two years and four months, unforgettable for a lifetime!" It expresses the infinite grief and indignation of the people behind enemy lines towards their past life of subjugation.

After the autumn and winter of 1949, every time the enemy occupied a place, they established various "laws": no hiding "Viet Minh," no meetings, no going out after dusk, no lighting lamps at night... "No," "No"... there were so many that it was impossible to remember them all, and what people needed to abide by was far more than what was stipulated. Not to mention providing the enemy troops with food, drink, play, and entertainment, in addition to these, each village had to provide one hundred civilian laborers every day, hand over hundreds of bamboo poles, and prepare a large amount of bricks, tiles, lime, and stones for building strongholds and repairing roads... In short, all the orders of the occupiers had to be followed, or you would lose your life.

The dams were dug open, the fields were barren, the oxen were taken away, granaries were burned to ashes one after another, and many villages were turned into rubble. From the newly built prisons and detention rooms everywhere, the miserable cries of people being tortured were constantly heard.

People dared not go out, dare not speak loudly. However, even with such caution and trepidation, unexpected disasters often suddenly descended.

A child in Hoanh Nha Commune, Giao Thuy District, Nam Dinh Province, was playing with a light at night, and his family did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, the enemy happened to pass by, saw the light in the house, and immediately shouted without asking the reason: "Viet Minh meeting!" They rushed into the house and killed all five members of the family, and set fire to the house before leaving.

A young man doing small business in Truc Ninh District was at home counting his goods one day when two enemy soldiers came in and reached out to grab them. The young man refused, and the enemy soldiers became angry and slapped him so hard that he could not lift his head. The leading enemy soldier took out two bullets and stuffed them into the goods, and ordered another enemy soldier to check. The bullets were naturally discovered quickly. So the young man was immediately charged with "harboring ammunition," and not only was all his goods "confiscated," but he was also taken away and shot "as a warning to the public."

In order to "pacify" the occupied areas, the enemy dragged residents out of their homes one by one for "screening." Those suspected of being "Viet Minh" were all sent to prison; women, the old and the young each paid five yuan to be sent home; the young were all detained and forced to join the puppet army. Large numbers of young people were driven into salt drying fields for "reflection." The enemy forced them at gunpoint to take off their clothes and stand on open-air cement fields to be baked by the sun, without giving them food or water. The sun in May was very hot, and being exposed to the sun felt like being pricked by millions of needles. The young people were quickly scorched, their lips cracked, sweat poured down like rain, and large blisters appeared on the soles of their feet, making it painful to stand. Many people could not support themselves and collapsed weakly on the ground. The enemy waited happily for them to surrender. But the enemy failed. These were young people who had been baptized by the August Revolution, they endured this most unbearable pain, and persisted for four or five days. Many people were baked to death alive; among the few who survived, not a single person betrayed their country to become a puppet soldier.

As time went by, almost every family had a dead person. The villages were full of people wearing white headbands to mourn the dead. The old people there shed tears when they mentioned the scene at that time.

"How can we go on living like this?" The survivors could not help but ask such a question.

At this time, the few cadres who remained behind enemy lines became even more active.

Many cadres who still persist behind enemy lines told reporters about their experiences in the struggle at that time.

At the beginning, the enemy searched very tightly, and the masses had not been well mobilized, so the work was very difficult. During the day, it was impossible to stay in the villages, so they had to spend the whole day soaking in the mud and water of the rice fields, or hiding in secret caves dug in the wild, and only came out to work at night to restore the destroyed mass base.

Farmers risked secretly sending food to the cadres. But when the enemy's search was particularly fierce, the farmers could not come out, and the cadres could only go hungry for one or two days in a row. There were many leeches in the rice fields, and they were bitten all over with blood. Worse was the rainy season, in this waterlogged area with crisscrossing rivers, many places had water up to the neck. The cadres needed to wear leaves on their heads as camouflage and float in the water to go everywhere to work. When they encountered the enemy, they had to stop moving. Sometimes they were soaked in the water for several days, and their skin became soft and white from being soaked in the water.

The enemy's investigation of the cadres became increasingly tight. Some cadres were unfortunately arrested and subjected to various tortures and beatings. But for those who devoted themselves to the just cause of national liberation, the enemy could not make them yield.

There was a young female cadre working in Giao Thuy District. She used to work there, and had a good relationship with the people, everyone affectionately called her "Sister Chun." When the enemy searched very strictly, activists carefully hid her in secret caves in their homes, and escorted her to work everywhere at night. Although people were worried about the enemy's patrols, they still welcomed her. Because she brought everyone news of the People's Army's victory on the main battlefield, brought President Ho Chi Minh's letter to the people behind enemy lines, and also brought them hope.

Later, Sister Chun was unfortunately captured by the enemy. The enemy buried her alive in a pit, leaving only her head exposed outside, making it very difficult to breathe. She finally suffocated to death three or four days later. When Sister Chun was buried alive, the enemy sent many soldiers to guard her closely, and people could not go to rescue her, so they had to cry secretly and remember this matter firmly in their hearts.

New hatred and old hatred were growing and deepening every day.

When the night was quiet, some families gently split open the bamboo tubes and took out the image of President Ho Chi Minh that they had deeply hidden inside. This old man, who was regarded by the Vietnamese people not only as a leader, but also as a father, smiled at them, with a firm and confident expression. This spirit encouraged the whole family, and President Ho's words resounded in their ears again: "We should win, and we must win, but victory will never fall from the sky, we should strive for it from battle, and strive for it from fierce battle."

The mass struggle against the enemy gradually unfolded.

Farmers and coastal residents gathered in the hundreds and thousands, forcing the occupiers to open the sluice gates, rebuild the dikes, and restore the salt fields and fishing grounds.

After the crops were harvested, the farmers scattered and hid the rice in caves, using various clever methods to deal with the enemy's search and plunder. At night, they carried baskets and bags of "resistance rice" on bamboo shoulder poles and pushed them on bicycles, under the cover of local troops and guerrillas, through countless lines of blockade by the French invading forces, and completed the arduous journey of hundreds of kilometers on foot, transporting them to the liberated areas.

The enemy's plan to threaten the liberated areas with hunger was completely shattered. They ordered all localities to immediately concentrate grain in the strongholds, and set up gallows at every intersection leading to the liberated areas, killing every patriotic farmer who was caught; in the end, they even desperately used tanks to crush the ripe rice in the fields.

However, no matter how frantically the enemy suppressed them, every time the grain was harvested, tens of thousands of tons of rice were still transported to the liberated areas by countless patriotic farmers at the risk of their lives. The same was true for salt.

People longed for the return of the resistance government to end their life of slavery as soon as possible. The people of Thai Lang District, Nam Dinh Province, collectively wrote a letter and entrusted it to the cadres to bring to the resistance government. They said that they could no longer live the life they were living now, and asked the government to send troops to liberate their hometown as soon as possible. If the troops could not come for a while, they asked the government to issue some weapons, and they were willing to organize and do everything they could to fight the enemy and prepare to cooperate with the troops to liberate their hometown.

In early 1952, the day the people had been waiting for arrived. The People's Army penetrated the enemy-controlled areas of the Red River Delta. The welcome they received from the people there was unparalleled.

At that time, a unit that entered Nam Dinh from Ha Nam via Ninh Binh encountered heavy rain on the first day of entering the enemy-controlled area, and the river water rose sharply. Just as the cadres were worried about how to arrange the wounded, they saw many women secretly rowing bamboo boats over, taking all the wounded away in batches and settling them in their homes. They groped in the wild at night and dug up a large number of wild potatoes, cooked them into sweet porridge, and gave them to the wounded. A soldier was injured in the stomach during the battle and could not lie down, so an old woman with white hair supported him to sit day and night.

Many villages had been looted by the enemy, and not even a piece of wood or a stone mortar for pounding rice was left. But people still tried to find one or two ripe oranges, some vegetables, or a few small fish to comfort the troops. They put the things into the hands of the soldiers and said: "This is just to show a little of our feelings."

After the Hoa Binh campaign, the left and right banks of the Red River were full of liberated free lands. A farmer went out to visit relatives after harvesting the crops, and said to everyone he met when he came back: "In the past, I shrank in the house all day and dared not show my face. Now, I can travel for two or three days without seeing an enemy. I really feel unspeakably happy!"

Today, the sons and daughters of the people behind enemy lines – the local troops of the Vietnam People's Army – are expanding more and more, and there are more and more guerrillas in the communes and villages, and young and middle-aged farmers aged eighteen to forty-five are joining the militia. The mass guerrilla warfare is developing vigorously like a prairie fire. The people behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta are using all their enthusiasm to defend these red lands that nurtured them and were obtained at the cost of countless lives.

    变敌人后方为他们的前线
    ——红河三角洲敌后斗争纪事
    新华社记者　展潮萧光
    在我们面前，是一幅越南北部平原——红河三角洲敌后斗争的形势图。
    法国侵略军用一条长长的碉堡线，把红河三角洲和越南北部解放区分割开来。现在，就在这个被敌人碉堡线包围着的红河三角洲的地图上，我们可以看到：一块块互相关联着的红色和淡红色的土地，以一道一道的红线，指向敌人占领的大城市河内、海防，以及一些重要据点和交通线。这就是使法国侵略军感到十分伤脑筋的敌后游击根据地和游击区。
    这种局面的形成，是在一九五二年初。当时，遵照着越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席的指示：“敌人进攻和平（地名）是歼灭敌人的良机”、“变敌人的后方为他们的前线”，越南人民军总部趁法国侵略军抽调大量机动部队进攻北越解放区和平省的时候，派几支主力部队迅速地插进红河三角洲，和坚持在那里的干部、地方部队和游击队互相配合，在敌人的后方纵横穿插，自由地来去。在不到两个月内，就拔掉了敌人一千多个据点，成县成区地摧垮了伪政权，解放了红河左岸、右岸和中游地区的大块土地。一九四九年秋冬被缩小了的游击根据地大都恢复过来了，有力地配合着正面战场的作战，使进犯解放区的侵略军腹背受敌，取得了和平战役的辉煌胜利。越南北部战场的主动权，从此落到越南人民军手里。
    法国侵略军前北越和上寮的总司令德李纳尔在他一九五二年六月“关于北部平原绥靖工作指示”中，也不得不气恼地承认说：“我们的计划被越盟打乱了！我们的军队被越盟支配了！”他说：“在军事方面，由于越盟引起的困难，所以我军活动总是分散的。政权方面也是如此，所有的力量都要分散在各地，结果不能在任何地区很好地实现绥靖工作。”
    为了挽救败局和改变这种被动挨打的形势，法国侵略军司令部把许多机动部队撤回红河三角洲，并以绝对优势的兵力集中在一个很小的地区内，进行长达三、四个月之久的反复“扫荡”，以达到各个击破越南人民敌后的游击根据地和游击区、实现其“绥靖北部平原”的目的。但是越南的人民武装已经站稳了脚跟。任凭法国侵略者使尽各种手段，都无法把红河三角洲的形势拉回到如同和平战役以前一样。
    今天，红河三角洲敌后的情况是：法国侵略军经常被牵制在这里的共有一百一十二个守备营和机动营的兵力，占法国侵略军在越南全部兵力的二分之一。游击根据地在频繁、紧张和艰苦的反“扫荡”中，不但巩固起来，而且还不断地在扩展着。从一九五二年六月到一九五三年六月的一年中，又有四十四个乡、八百九十四个村的土地被解放了。
    不久以前，越南人民军总部公布了红河三角洲敌后战场一年来的战绩：从一九五二年七月到一九五三年七月，人民军地方部队和游击队、民兵主动作战五千零七十次，击毙、击伤和俘掳敌军五万二千多名；拔除和逼敌撤退据点二六二个；缴获大量各种武器。越南人民这一出色的战斗，给予一贯吹嘘“努力巩固后方，彻底绥靖平原，杜绝共方主要供应来源”的法国侵略者又一个沉重的打击。
    法国殖民主义者永远也不会明白，在他们后方这些解放了的土地上蕴藏着多么伟大的力量。这个由千万人民的血和泪凝结而成的力量，是不可征服的。红河右岸南定省一带的人民群众中，至今还流传着这样一句话：“两年零四个月，一辈子难忘！”它表露着敌后人民对过去沦陷生活的无限的悲愤。
    一九四九年秋冬以后，敌人每占领一处，就定下种种“法令”：不准掩藏“越盟”，不准开会，傍晚以后不准外出，夜里不准点灯……“不准”、
  “不准”……多得都没法记清，而人们需要遵行的却远比规定的还要多。且不说要给敌军吃、喝、玩、乐，除了这些，每村每天都要出一百个民工，交成百根的竹竿，大量准备造据点、修公路用的砖、瓦、灰、石，……总之，占领者的一切命令都得照办，要不就得送命。
    堤坝被掘开了，田圃荒芜了，耕牛被牵走了，一间又一间的谷仓被烧成灰烬，许多村落变成一片瓦砾场。从各处新建起来的监狱、囚房里面，不断地传出被拷打的人们的惨痛叫声。
    人们不敢出门，不敢大声说话。然而，就是这样的小心翼翼、战战兢兢，意外的灾祸还是常常突然地降临。
    南定省交水县横芽社的一个小孩，晚上闹着玩点亮了灯，家里人也没有留意。不想刚巧碰上敌人路过，看见屋内有亮，不问情由立刻大吼：“越盟开会！”冲进屋去把全家五口统统打死，临走还放火烧掉了房子。
  直宁县有一个做小生意的青年，一天正在家里盘点货物，进来两个敌军，伸手就抢。青年不答应，敌军恼羞成怒，一个巴掌打过去，疼得那青年抬不起脑袋。领头的敌军随手掏出两颗子弹塞在货物里，叫另一个敌军动手检查。子弹自然很快被发现了。于是这青年立刻被加上“窝藏军火”的罪名，不但被“没收”了全部货物，人还被押去枪毙“示众”。
    敌人为了“平定”占领区，挨家挨户地把居民抓出“甄别”。有“越盟”嫌疑的一概送进监狱；妇女老幼每人交五块钱放回家去；年轻的全被扣下强迫他们参加伪军。大批青年被赶进晒盐场去“反省”。敌人用枪逼着他们脱光衣裳、站在水泥砌成的露天场子上让太阳晒，不给饭吃，也没有水喝。五月的太阳正热，晒到人身上就像千万根针在扎一样。青年们很快就被晒得皮焦肉痛，口唇干裂，汗水像雨一般地淌下来，脚板烫起了大颗的水泡，疼得站不住脚。许多人支持不住了，无力地昏倒在地上。敌人满心高兴地等着他们屈服。但是敌人失败了。这是一些受过八月革命洗礼的年轻人，他们经受住了这种最难忍的痛苦，一直坚持了四、五天之久，许多人被活活地晒死了；侥幸剩下来的少数人中间也始终没有一个人背叛祖国去当伪军。
    日子一久，几乎家家都有了死人。村子里到处是头缠白布的带孝人。那里的老百姓一提起当时的情景就落泪。
      “这日子怎么往下过啊？”活下来的人们不由得发出这样的问题。
    这时候，少数留在敌后的干部就活动得更勤了。
    许多至今还坚持在敌人后方的干部，把当时的斗争经历告诉了记者。
    开始，敌人搜索得很紧，群众也还没有很好发动，工作是很困难的。白天不能在村里落脚，只得成天泡在稻田的泥水里，或是在野外挖了秘密洞藏身，深夜才能出来活动，以恢复被破坏了的群众基础。
    农民冒险偷偷地给干部送饭。但当敌人搜索得特别厉害的时候，农民们出不来，干部只能接连一两天地干饿着。稻田里蚂蝗很多，咬得浑身是血。更糟的是雨季，这一片河川交错的水网地区，许多地方积水没到颈部。干部们需要头上顶着树叶作为伪装，浮水到各处去活动。遇到了敌人，只得停止不动，有时在水里连浸几天，皮肤被水泡得松软发白。
    敌人对干部的追查是越来越紧了。有些干部不幸被捕，受到各种酷刑、毒打。但是对于献身于民族解放正义事业的人们，敌人是无法使他们屈服的。
    有一个年青的妇女干部在交水县活动。她过去就在那里工作，和人民群众的关系很好，大家都亲热地叫她“纯姐”。当敌人搜捕很严的时候，积极分子小心地把她藏在自己家中的秘密洞里，夜间护送她到各处去活动。人们虽然担心敌人的巡逻，但还是欢迎她去。因为她给大家带来了人民军在正面战场上的胜利消息，带来了胡志明主席给敌后人民的信，也给他们带来了希望。
    以后纯姐不幸被敌人抓去了。敌人把她活埋在土坑里，只露出一个头在外面，呼吸十分困难。三四天后，终于窒息死去。当活埋纯姐的时候，敌人派了许多士兵严密的守着，人们没法去救，只好在暗地里哭泣，把这件事牢牢地记在心头。
    新仇旧恨，每天都在增长和加深着。
    当夜深人静的时候，有些人家轻轻地劈开竹筒，取出他们深藏在里面的胡志明主席的像。这位被越南人民看作不只是领袖、而且也是父亲的老人，向他们微笑着，那样子坚定而有信心。这精神鼓舞着全家人，胡主席的话重又在他们的耳边作响：“我们应当胜利，而且我们一定胜利，但胜利决不是从天上掉下来的，我们应从战斗中去争取，而且是从激烈的战斗中去争取。”
    群众性的对敌斗争逐渐展开了。
    农民和沿海的居民成百成千地集合起来，逼迫着占领者开放了水闸，重新修筑起堤坝，恢复了盐田和渔场。
    庄稼收成以后，农民们把大米分散藏在地洞里，用各种巧妙的办法对付敌人的搜索、掠夺。夜间，他们便把成筐成袋的“抗战米”，用竹扁担挑着、用自行车推着，在地方部队和游击队的掩护下，通过无数道法国侵略军的封锁线，徒步完成几百公里的艰难行程，向解放区输送。
    敌人以饥饿威胁解放区的计划完全被打破了。他们下令各地立刻把粮食集中到据点里，并在每一个通往解放区的路口上都设下了绞架，杀害每一个被抓到的爱国农民；最后，甚至穷凶极恶地用坦克车去压坏田里的熟稻。
    但是，不管敌人怎样疯狂镇压，每当谷物收成的季节，成千上万担的大米，还是由无数爱国农民冒着生命的危险搬运到解放区。食盐也是一样。
    人们渴望着抗战政府回来，早些结束他们奴隶式的生活。南定省太朗县的人民集体写信托干部带给抗战政府。他们说现在的日子实在没法过下去，要求派部队早些来解放家乡。如果部队一时不能来，就请政府发给些武器，他们愿意组织起来，尽一切力量和敌人对抗，做好配合部队解放的准备。
    一九五二年初，人民盼望的日子到来了，人民军插进了红河三角洲的敌后地区，他们受到那里人民群众的欢迎是无法比拟的。
    当时，由河南经宁平进入南定的一支部队，开进敌后的头一天就碰上大雨，河水猛涨。干部正在发愁怎么安排伤员的时候，只见到许多妇女偷偷地划着竹船过来，把所有的伤员都分批地接走，安顿到自己的家里去。她们夜间摸索着在野外挖了大批野薯回来，熬成甜稀饭，给伤员吃。有一个战士打仗时伤了肚子，不能躺倒，一位白发苍苍的老婆婆就整天整夜地扶着他坐。
    许多村庄已被敌人搜刮干净，连一块木头、一个桩米的石臼都没剩下。但人们还是设法找出一两只熟透了的柑子、一些蔬菜或几条小鱼去慰劳部队。他们把东西塞到战士们手里说：“这只是表示我们一点心意”。
    在和平战役以后，红河左右两岸，到处是一块块解放了的自由土地。有一个农民收罢庄稼出去看亲戚，回来逢人便说：“过去成天缩在屋里不敢露面，如今出外赶两三天路也见不到一个敌人。心里真有说不出的痛快！”
    今天，敌后人民的子弟兵——越南人民军地方部队是越来越扩大了，社（乡）、村的游击队员也越来越多，十八岁到四十五岁的青壮年农民都参加了民兵。群众性的游击战争，有如星火燎原似的，蓬勃地开展起来。红河三角洲敌后人民正以他们的全部热情，来保卫着这些养育着他们、而又是用无数鲜血的代价得来的红色的土地。
