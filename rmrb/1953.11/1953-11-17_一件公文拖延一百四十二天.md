    A Document Delayed for One Hundred and Forty-Two Days

    Reader Zhang Zongchao writes: The Education Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government drafted a notice on the use and management of miscellaneous fees paid by students on May 21st and submitted it to the Provincial People's Government for review. After receiving the draft notice, the Provincial People's Government, for the sake of prudence, sent it to the Provincial Cultural and Educational Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Cultural and Educational Committee") for comments. However, a long time passed, and the Cultural and Educational Committee still did not return the draft notice. Various localities urged the Education Department to issue the document quickly, so the Education Department repeatedly urged the Cultural and Educational Committee to handle it. However, the person answering the phone at the Cultural and Educational Committee always replied in the same old way: "We'll check it." "The director hasn't finished reading it; it will be returned after he finishes reading it." On June 30th, the Education Department received an instruction from the Cultural and Educational Committee stating, "The director has read your department's report and agrees." However, the draft notice was not returned. The Education Department called to inquire and found that this instruction was irrelevant and a mistake! Later, after ten days of inquiry, it was discovered that the draft notice had been lost. As a result, the original drafter had to re-draft it, completing the second draft of the notice on July 16th. On the 24th, the director approved and sent it to the Cultural and Educational Committee for review. On August 5th, the Cultural and Educational Committee returned it with comments. On the 17th, the Education Department revised the draft notice and sent it to the Provincial People's Government. On the 18th, the Provincial People's Government sent it to the Provincial Department of Finance, instructing them to consult with the Provincial Finance and Economic Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Finance Committee") for signature and then submit it for review. On the 27th, the Director of the Department of Finance signed and sent it to the Finance Committee. On the 29th, the Finance Committee signed and sent it back to the Provincial People's Government. On the 31st, the Provincial People's Government returned it to the Education Department for revision. On September 3rd, it was revised and sent to the Provincial People's Government again, which then sent it to relevant departments for review. This draft notice thus went through a tortuous and difficult journey of one hundred and forty-two days, from May 21st until it was finally issued by the Provincial People's Government on October 9th. Such document circulation is truly intolerable!

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一件公文拖延一百四十二天
    读者张宗超来信：山东省人民政府教育厅在五月二十一日拟定了一个关于学生所缴杂费使用及管理办法的通知稿，送交省人民政府审阅。省人民政府接到这个通知稿后，为了慎重起见，便送交省文化教育委员会（以下简称文委）提出意见。可是，过了很长时间，文委还不把通知稿退回。各地都催促教育厅快下达文件，教育厅就多次向文委催办。可是，文委接电话的人总是老一套地答复：“我们查一查。”“主任未看完，看完后就退回去。”六月三十日，教育厅接到了文委的批示，说是“你厅的报告，主任已阅过，同意。”但是，通知稿却未见退回。教育厅打电话问了一下，原来这个批示是答非所问，弄错啦！后来，又经过十天的查问，才发现这个通知稿已经丢失了。于是，原起稿人只好又重新起草，七月十六日完成了第二次通知稿。二十四日，厅长批送文委审核。八月五日，文委提出意见后退回。十七日，教育厅将通知稿修正后送省人民政府。十八日，省人民政府送省财政厅嘱商同省财政经济委员会（以下简称财委）签后送核。二十七日，财政厅长签字送财委。二十九日，财委签字送回省人民政府。三十一日，省人民政府退回教育厅修正。九月三日，修正后再送省人民政府，由省人民政府再送有关部门审查。这个通知稿就这样转来转去，从五月二十一日起，经过了一百四十二天的曲折多难的旅行，到十月九日才由省人民政府发出。这样的公文旅行实在不能容忍！
