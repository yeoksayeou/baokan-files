	Han Cadres in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region Achieve Success in Learning Dai Language and Script
	The Han cadres and cadres of other ethnic groups (excluding the Dai) directly under the Xishuangbanna Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region have made initial achievements in learning the Dai language and script. After three months of study, most of the Han cadres and cadres of other ethnic groups in these organs have learned the Dai phonetic alphabet, and about half of the cadres can already listen to and speak general everyday language. Through testing, 40 percent of the people can already spell and read "Following the Road of the Soviet Elder Brother," published by Yunnan People's Publishing House in a four-language comparison of Han, Dai, and other languages. The cadres have realized that ethnic languages ​​and scripts are important tools for making autonomous organs ethnic, connecting with the masses, and doing a good job in ethnic work. They have all demonstrated the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, hard work, and intensive research in their studies.
