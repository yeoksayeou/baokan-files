    The Second Giant Reservoir in China's Water Conservancy Construction
    Hun River Dahuo House Reservoir Project Officially Starts Construction
    The Dahuo House Reservoir project on the Hun River, the second giant reservoir built in China's water conservancy construction, officially commenced in early November. The mechanical stone excavation team, which came to support from the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, is clearing the topsoil at the foot of the mountain on the right bank of the Hun River.
    The Dahuo House Reservoir is being built in Dahuo House Village, a suburb of Fushun City, in the middle reaches of the Hun River. The entire project is divided into two phases. The first phase focuses on flood control and irrigation, including the construction of a 41-meter-high and 1,367-meter-long large earth dam, a 556-meter-long water conveyance tunnel, and an 850-meter-long and 100-meter-wide spillway. These projects are expected to be completed before the flood season in 1956. At that time, the maximum water storage capacity of the Dahuo House Reservoir will reach 1.859 billion cubic meters. The second phase will involve the construction of power generation and irrigation projects. This year, the water conveyance tunnel will be excavated first. Next year, the large earth dam and spillway will begin to be constructed.
    The construction of the Hun River Dahuo House Reservoir has received support in terms of manpower and materials from various regions. Hundreds of thousands of administrative cadres, engineers and technicians, various skilled workers and laborers, as well as a large number of building materials, have gathered at the construction site from all directions. The mechanical stone excavation team from Guanting Reservoir and the drilling team from Fozi Ling Reservoir will be responsible for the tunneling of the Dahuo House Reservoir and the drilling and grouting of the large earth dam base. More than 1,000 civil engineering, electrical, and mechanical workers, as well as drivers of small trains, dump trucks, tractors, and excavators, from Fushun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Andong, and other cities, have built basic facilities such as bridges, roads, light railways, electrical equipment, and factories at the reservoir construction site. In addition, cadres sent by the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government and the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, as well as a group of new graduates from universities and technical schools in Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Tianjin, and other places, have also participated in engineering design, technical guidance, and administrative management in the reservoir construction. Mechanical manufacturing and forestry workers in various regions have also produced and supplied a large amount of machinery and timber for the construction of the Dahuo House Reservoir. From 1952 to the present, more than 440 train cars of various materials, weighing more than 13,500 tons, have been transported to the construction site. Among them, the light rails supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been laid to various construction sites, with a total length of 11,400 meters. Air compressors, motors, transformers, and other equipment from Shenyang have equipped the air compressor plant on the construction site. Pneumatic picks and pneumatic drills made in Shanghai and Shenyang have armed the rock drilling workers. Sheep foot rollers made in Beijing will also participate in the rolling of the large earth dam. In addition, there are Soviet excavators, Czechoslovak dump trucks, and dozens of types of construction machinery manufactured by factories across China on the construction site.

    我国水利建设中的第二个巨型水库
    浑河大伙房水库工程正式开工
    我国水利建设中修建的第二个巨型水库——浑河大伙房水库工程，已在十一月初旬正式开工。从永定河官厅水库赶来支援的机械开石工程队，正在浑河右岸山麓下清除山根表土。
    大伙房水库修建在浑河中游抚顺市郊的大伙房村。这座水库的全部工程分两期施工。第一期防洪兼顾灌溉，包括修建一座四十一公尺高、一千三百六十七公尺长的拦河大土坝，一个总长五百五十六公尺的输水隧洞和一个八百五十公尺长、一百公尺宽的溢洪道。这些工程预计可在一九五六年汛期前完工。那时大伙房水库最大蓄水量可达十八亿五千九百万立方公尺。第二期再兴建发电和灌溉等工程。今年首先开凿输水隧洞。明年开始修建拦河大土坝和溢洪道。
    浑河大伙房水库的修建，得到各地人力、物力的支援。数以千百计的行政干部、工程师和技术员、各种技术工人和民工以及大批建筑器材，已从四面八方汇集到工地。来自官厅水库的机械开石工程队和佛子岭水库的钻探队，将担负大伙房水库隧洞的开凿工程和拦河大土坝基地的钻探、灌浆工作。来自抚顺、沈阳、锦州、安东及其他城市的土木建筑、电气、机械工人和小火车、自卸汽车、拖拉机、挖土机司机等一千多人，已在水库工地把桥梁、公路、轻便铁轨、电气设备和厂房等基本修筑好。此外，中央人民政府水利部工程总局和东北行政委员会水利局派来的干部，以及一批新从成都、重庆、武汉、天津等地的大学、专科学校毕业的学生，也都参加了水库建设中的工程设计、技术指导和行政管理等项工作。各地的机械制造业和林业工人也为修建大伙房水库生产和供应了大量的机械和用材。从一九五二年到现在，运到工地的各种器材已有四百四十多车皮，重达一万三千五百多吨。其中鞍山钢铁公司供应的轻便铁轨，已铺到各施工地点，总长达一万一千四百公尺。沈阳的空气压缩机、电动机、变压器等装备了工地上的空气压缩机厂。上海和沈阳造的风镐、风钻武装了凿岩工人。北京造的羊脚碾，也要参加大土坝的滚压工作。此外，工地上还有苏联的挖土机、捷克斯洛伐克的自卸汽车和我国国内各地工厂制造的几十种建筑机器。
