Yunnan Province's state-owned commercial departments vigorously organized local sources of goods, meeting market needs.

After correcting the erroneous idea of not valuing the purchase and processing of local handicrafts in July and August, the state-owned commercial departments of Yunnan Province reformulated plans to expand local purchases and actively acquired goods, greatly enriching the supply. Compared with the first half of the year, the variety of goods in trade departments at all levels increased: over 1,100 types of general merchandise were added, and the previously sporadic shortages of towels and socks in various places were basically resolved, satisfying supply. Due to the organization of local sources of goods, handicraft production and rural side occupations have been further developed. For example, the Yuxi County Trading Company paid out over 668 million yuan in processing fees for handicrafts and rural side occupations in July and August. Among these, wool felt was the main tool for caravan transportation in the area. In the past, no processing orders were placed, leading to a shortage of wool felt; at the same time, 80% of the 130 wool felt handicraft households in the area had stopped work. The company processed 9,247 wool felt mats in July and August, not only guaranteeing supply but also restoring more than 70 wool felt handicraft households. To supply agricultural tools for the autumn harvest, they also processed baskets, manure baskets, etc.

In organizing local sources of goods, Yunnan Province's state-owned commercial departments mainly focused on two key aspects: First, they conducted thorough investigations of the local products' output, specifications, and quality. Based on market demand, they organized sources of goods to make processing and procurement plans feasible and prevent blind stimulation of production and stockpiling of funds. After gathering sufficient materials, they determined which products should be exclusively sold, processed, ordered, or purchased. After signing contracts, they prevented a "set it and forget it" mentality, constantly supervising and inspecting to solve production problems and ensure the smooth implementation of procurement plans. Second, state-owned commercial departments closely cooperated with local factories, mines, enterprises, and relevant departments to jointly resolve issues such as product prices, profits, and specifications, and to align production and sales plans. Based on the output of various products in various regions of the province, market demand, and industrial production capacity, they studied which products should be produced more, maintained at the current level, reduced in production, or stopped altogether. Then, through the state-owned commercial departments' and cooperatives' purchase, processing, and ordering, they specifically guided production to adapt to sales. To ensure unified action, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce, in coordination with relevant companies and the Provincial Department of Industry, the Provincial Cooperative, and the Kunming Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, jointly established the "Industrial Product Processing Office" and the "State-Owned Product Review Team" to promptly resolve product quality and price issues. Due to the close cooperation between state-owned commerce and industry, it was relatively easy to negotiate and resolve issues such as the prices and profits of private products.

    云南国营商业部门组织地方货源供应市场
    云南省国营商业部门大力组织地方货源，满足了市场需要。
    云南省国营商业部门于七、八月间纠正了不重视当地手工业品的采购和加工的错误思想后，重新制订了扩大当地进货计划，积极收购，大大充实了货源。与上半年比较，各级贸易部门品种花色增多：百货增加了一千一百多种，原来各地断续脱销的毛巾、袜子，基本已可满足供应。由于组织地方货源，手工业生产和农村副业得到进一步发展，如玉溪县贸易公司在七、八两月中付出手工业和农村副业的加工费达六亿六千八百多万元，其中羊毛毡是该区马帮运输的主要用具，过去没有加工订货，造成羊毛毡脱销；同时，全区制毡手工业一百三十户中停工者达百分之八十。该公司七、八两月共加工毛毡九千二百四十七床，不但保证了供应，而且恢复制羊毛毡手工业七十多户。为了供应秋收农具，又加工了箩、粪箕等。
    云南省国营商业部门在组织地方货源工作中，主要是抓住了两个环节：第一、切实调查本地产品的产量、规格和品质，根据市场需要量组织货源，使加工、采购计划切实可行，防止盲目刺激生产和积压资金现象。掌握充分材料后，再分别确定那些产品应该进行包销、加工、订货或收购。在订立合同后，要防止“万事大吉”的思想，随时督促检查，解决生产等方面的困难，保证进货计划的顺利实现。第二、国营商业部门和地方厂矿企业以及有关部门密切配合，共同解决产品价格、利润、规格等问题，并使产、销计划衔接起来。根据全省各地各种产品的产量和市场需要量与工业生产能力，分别研究那些应该多产，那些维持现状、减产或停产，然后通过国营商业部门和合作社的收购、加工、订货，具体指导生产，使产销相适应。为了保证步调的统一，云南省商业厅配合各有关公司与工业厅、省合作社、昆明市工商局等单位联合成立了
  “工业品加工办公室”、“国营产品审查小组”等，及时解决产品质量和价格问题。由于国营商业和工业的密切配合，对私营产品价格、利润等问题，也比较容易协商解决。（本报记者李策）
