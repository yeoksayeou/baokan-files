To ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year
Wheat is an important grain crop in our country. Shaanxi Province achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year. Summarizing the experiences of this year's high-yield wheat, improving cultivation techniques, and doing a good job in winter wheat sowing are important links in striving for and ensuring increased grain production next year. The Xi'an Masses Daily seized this link and conducted timely publicity on summarizing the experiences of this year's high-yield wheat and striving for increased wheat production next year before the sowing of winter wheat. The newspaper successively published reports such as "Wu Gong County Holds Wheat High-Yield Competition Meeting" on July 9th and "Wheat Yield in Wu Gong County Can Still Be Increased" and "Wu Gong County Formulates Next Year's Wheat High-Yield Plan" on August 15th, prominently introducing the experience of Wu Gong County, Shaanxi Province, in summarizing this year's wheat high-yield experience, finding ways to increase production, and formulating next year's production increase plan. Before and after the summer harvest this year, the county's leading organs, with the assistance of the Northwest China Wheat Competition Working Group of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, summarized the local wheat high-yield experience after in-depth investigation and research. The main high-yield experiences of Wu Gong County's wheat in cultivation techniques are: long-term crop rotation of alfalfa, peas, and wheat, which increased soil fertility; good habits of accumulating fertilizer; promotion of "Bi Ma No. 1" and "6028" improved varieties; and the adoption of row planting with close spacing. From the summary, it was found that the current shortcomings are serious seedling deficiencies and a lack of attention to applying base fertilizer. To further increase yield, it is necessary to achieve "equal spacing, dense sowing, reducing seedling deficiencies, deep plowing with double draft animals, applying base fertilizer to wheat fields, and paying attention to increasing wheat yield for households without draft animals." At the county-wide wheat high-yield competition meeting held at the end of June, Wu Gong County also organized representatives of high-yield models to exchange high-yield experiences and discuss key issues in wheat production increase. After finding ways to increase production that are suitable for local conditions and acceptable to the masses, the leading organs of Wu Gong County formulated a plan for next year's wheat high yield. The plan stipulates that it is necessary to improve the technology of broadcasting and sowing, promote seed dressing with chemicals, reduce the seedling deficiency rate to 10%; expand fertilizer sources and apply more base fertilizer; deeply plow to preserve moisture, cultivate soil fertility, and do a good job in land preparation; and carry out winter hoeing and winter irrigation in areas with suitable conditions and soil moisture to strive for a 5% increase in wheat production next year compared to this year. In order to truly implement these regulations for improving cultivation techniques among the masses, after formulating the high-yield plan, Wu Gong County not only convened a joint meeting of all district chiefs and a symposium of old farmers and labor models in each district to discuss the plan in detail, but also the county leaders consciously understood the specific difficulties of cadres and the masses in implementing the plan, such as the lack of base fertilizer and sowing equipment, and made appropriate solutions, which provided a guarantee for the smooth implementation of the plan. In order to promote the practice of Wu Gong County in summarizing high-yield experience and formulating production increase plans, the Xi'an Masses Daily successively published short commentaries and editorials on August 15th and 31st, calling on cadres leading agricultural production in various regions to strengthen specific leadership over winter wheat sowing work, learn from Wu Gong's experience, go deep among the masses and into the fields, summarize the experience of this year's wheat high yield in light of local characteristics, grasp key issues, and find ways to further increase yield; at the same time, after formulating next year's high-yield plan, it is also necessary to go deep into the grassroots to study the specific difficulties in implementation and solve them in a timely and practical manner.

Subsequently, from late August, the Xi'an Masses Daily continuously reported on the situation of other counties in Shaanxi Province summarizing high-yield experience, finding ways to increase production, and formulating production increase plans. In early and mid-August, the leading organs and farms and agricultural technology guidance stations in Chang'an, Yijun, Chaoyi and other counties successively convened wheat high-yield evaluation meetings, wheat high-yield model meetings, etc., to exchange and summarize this year's local wheat high-yield experience, and put forward specific measures to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year. The newspaper also specifically introduced the production increase methods found among the masses in the "How to Do Farming" column, such as doing a good job in land preparation before sowing, applying base fertilizer, and row planting with close spacing, so that farmers in various regions can adopt and implement them in this year's winter wheat sowing according to specific circumstances.

According to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses" and "using local materials and promoting them locally," the Xi'an Masses Daily, through typical examples, mobilized various regions to summarize and promote this year's wheat high-yield experience and do a good job in winter wheat sowing, which has a positive promoting effect on striving for increased grain production next year.

    为了明年小麦的丰收
    小麦是我国的重要粮食作物。今年陕西省小麦获得了丰收。总结今年小麦丰产的经验，改进耕作技术，做好冬小麦的播种工作，是争取和保证明年粮食增产的重要环节。西安群众日报抓住了这个环节，在冬小麦播种前及时地进行了总结今年小麦丰产经验、争取明年小麦增产的宣传。该报曾于七月九日和八月十五日先后发表“武功县举行小麦丰产评比大会”、“武功县的小麦产量还可以继续提高”和“武功县订出明年小麦丰产计划”等报道，突出地介绍了陕西省武功县总结今年小麦丰产经验，找出增产办法和订立明年增产计划的经验。今年夏收前后，该县领导机关在中央农业部西北区小麦评比工作组的协助下，经过深入的调查研究，总结了当地小麦丰产的经验。武功县小麦在耕作技术上的主要丰产经验是：多年来的苜蓿、豌豆与小麦的轮作，增加了土壤的肥力；有较良好的积肥习惯；推广了“碧蚂一号”和“六○二八”良种；采用了条播密植等。从总结中发现目前还存在的缺点是缺苗现象严重，不注意上底肥等。而要进一步提高产量，就要做到“等距、密播、减少缺苗，双套牲口深耕，麦田上底粪及注意提高无牲口户麦田产量”。该县在六月底举行的全县小麦丰产评比大会上，又组织丰产模范代表交流了丰产经验和讨论了小麦增产中的关键问题。在找到了适合当地情况并为群众所能够接受的增产办法后，武功县领导机关制订了明年小麦丰产的计划，计划中规定要提高摆耧和撒播技术，推广药剂拌种，缺苗率降低到百分之十；扩大粪源，多施底粪；深耕保墒，培养地力，做好整地工作；按有条件地区及地墒情况进行冬锄、冬灌等，以争取明年小麦比今年增产百分之五。为了使这些改进耕作技术的规定真正贯彻到群众中去，武功县在订出丰产计划后，除召开了全县区长联席会议和各区老农、劳动模范座谈会，详细地讨论了这个计划外，县领导上还有意识地了解了干部、群众在执行计划中的具体困难，如缺乏底粪和播种时使用的耧等，并作了适当的解决，这就为顺利执行计划提供了保证。西安群众日报为推广武功县总结丰产经验、订立增产计划的作法，八月十五日、三十一日先后发表了短评和社论，号召各地领导农业生产的干部加强对冬小麦播种工作的具体领导，学习武功经验，深入群众，深入田间，根据当地特点，抓住关键性问题，总结当地今年小麦丰产的经验，并找出进一步提高产量的途径；同时在订出明年的丰产计划后，还要深入下层研究执行中的具体困难，及时地切实地加以解决。
    接着，西安群众日报从八月下旬起，连续地报道了陕西省其他各县总结丰产经验、找增产办法、订立增产计划的情形。八月上旬和中旬，长安、宜君、朝邑等县的领导机关和农场、农业技术指导站，都先后召开了小麦丰产评比会、小麦丰产模范会议等，交流与总结了今年当地的小麦丰产经验，提出了争取明年小麦丰收的具体办法。该报并在“怎样做庄稼”的专栏中，具体地介绍了群众中找出来的增产办法，如在播种前做好整地工作，上底粪，条播密植等，以便各地农民根据具体情况在今年冬小麦播种中加以采纳实行。
    西安群众日报根据“从群众中来，到群众中去”、“就地取材，就地推广”的方针，通过典型事例来动员各地总结和推广今年小麦丰产的经验，做好冬小麦播种工作，对争取明年粮食增产是有积极的推动作用的。
