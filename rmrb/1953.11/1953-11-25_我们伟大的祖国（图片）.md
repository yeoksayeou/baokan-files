In the increase production and practice economy campaign, the employees of the stripping section of the Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine successfully renovated the track-shifting machine, reducing the heavy physical labor of the workers and the loss rate of the tracks.

This is a picture of technician Wen Zhiliang (left) working with veteran workers on the track-shifting machine.
