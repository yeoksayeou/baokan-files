　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 14th: Yu Hui-ru, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who returned on the 10th, revealed the various crimes committed by US special agents in the POW camp "hospital," once again confirming that the so-called "hospital" area in Dongchang-ri had become a place for US special agents to persecute prisoners of war and direct sabotage of the explanatory work.

　　Yu Hui-ru said: On the evening of October 21st, the same day that Wang Xianzhang, a prisoner of war of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, escaped from the 44th camp of the Dongchang-ri POW camp "hospital" to apply for repatriation, four more prisoners of war were beaten by special agents on the charge of "conspiring with Wang Xianzhang to escape." Wang Xianzhang himself was beaten and sentenced to "death" by special agents on the charge of "conspiring with Wang Xiang to escape" after his friend Wang Xiang escaped from the camp to apply for repatriation.

　　On the morning of October 21st, after Wang Xianzhang climbed out of the barbed wire, the special agents immediately ordered the tent curtains to be lowered, forbidding anyone from going out. Special agents Deng Hongxun, Hu Kechang, and others held a secret meeting to discuss the matter. That night, special agents Wang Junsheng, Xu Lingui, and others pinned Pang Bin, Yang Daifa, Kang Guoxiang, and Wu Chuanyou, whom the special agents suspected, to the floor and beat them with tent poles, forcing them to admit that they "conspired with Wang Xianzhang to escape." At first, they did not cry out, but after being beaten about thirty times each, they began to shout. The special agents covered their heads with blankets, then tied them to the beds, not even allowing them to go out to relieve themselves. After being tied up for a week, the special agents had people from other camps take them away, and their whereabouts are now unknown.

　　Yu Hui-ru said: Because the special agents were afraid that the prisoners of war would hear the broadcasts of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and know that they had the right to repatriation, they had long ago dismantled the radios. The two radios in the 44th camp were taken down by the special agents, covered with raincloth, and pieced together to make a drum.

　　Yu Hui-ru also confirmed that the special agent "Teacher Ma" sent by the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, who worked in the POW camp "hospital," came to the 44th camp (internal medicine ward) two or three times a week to secretly discuss matters with Deng Hongxun, Hu Kechang, and other special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war, and passed on many "instructions" and messages to them. Then, special agent Deng Hongxun and others handed the "instructions" over to the special agents of each detachment who "escorted" the prisoners of war to see the doctor, who then took them to each camp. Yu Hui-ru also remembered some of the "instructions" and "messages" that the special agents had conveyed to the prisoners of war: (1) Push the blame for the murder of Zhang on the Indians, threaten the Indians, and the special agents also said that "President Li" was prepared to use force against the Indian army if necessary; (2) Force the prisoners of war in the "hospital" to feign illness and refuse to listen to explanations. If the explanatory representatives came in, they should attack them with wooden sticks and daggers that had been hidden in advance.

　　Yu Hui-ru said: "I originally hoped that the explanatory work would start soon so that I could return to my motherland, but the special agents said that the prisoners of war in the 'hospital' would not be allowed to listen to the explanations at all, and also said: The explanatory work period has passed halfway. I thought: If I don't escape now, I will never be able to return to my motherland in my life. On the night of the 5th, I didn't close my eyes all night. Later, when I saw the special agent 'guard' sitting in the tent watching us with his back to me, I secretly slipped out of the tent and climbed over the barbed wire with all my strength to escape from the camp."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 14th: Volunteer Army returnees who escaped from the Dongchang-ri POW camp "hospital" area by climbing over the barbed wire unanimously confirmed that "Teacher Ma," a Chiang Kai-shek special agent from Taiwan who was active in the camp area in the capacity of a US "administrative staff," was the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Volunteer Army prisoner of war Zhang on October 1st. This special agent has also been directing other special agents in the POW camp to sabotage the explanatory work.

　　Before and after the special agents in the "hospital" murdered prisoner of war Zhang, this Mr. Ma, a US-Chiang special agent, had given instructions to the murderers. Chang Feie (also known as Chang Zhongxin), a Volunteer Army returnee, heard special agent Deng Hongxun say to Ge Yunfei, another special agent living in the kitchen, on October 2nd, the day after prisoner of war Zhang was killed: "Yesterday, we beat that Zhang to death. 'Teacher Ma' had instructed us to starve him to death without leaving a trace. Yesterday, we took advantage of the opportunity to beat the Neutral Nations personnel to death and reported that the Indians had beaten him to death." A few days later, returnee Wang Xiang (who was then a guard) heard this Mr. Ma say to Deng Hongxun: "If you find any suspicious people in the future, first cut off the words tattooed on their bodies, and then kill them. The corpses can be buried in the ground in the tents. If the Indians inquire, say that they ran away by climbing over the barbed wire. Give me the cut-off flesh, and I will find a way to send it to Taiwan later."

　　The riot that occurred in the "hospital" camp area on the day prisoner of war Zhang was killed was also arranged by this Mr. Ma. That morning, Chang Feie heard him say to special agent Ge Yunfei: "Today, the Neutral Nations personnel are coming to visit the hospital, you must throw stones at the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives!"

　　This Mr. Ma also brought weapons and secret documents into the camp area for the special agents. The returnees said that on October 11th, he gave a seven- or eight-inch-long American-made dagger and a Kuomintang flag to special agent Hu Kechang, and said: "You must also make some knives yourselves, and all squad leaders and above must carry knives." On September 27th, he gave a small book to special agent Deng Hongxun. Afterwards, the special agents often studied this book. Returnee Wang Xianzhang heard Deng Hongxun say to other special agents: "These contact signals must be remembered, kept secret, and used skillfully and quickly when the time comes."

　　This Mr. Ma had personally arranged anti-explanatory activities for special agent Deng Hongxun in the 44th camp of the "hospital" camp area as early as September 27th. He said: "When the Communist Party representatives come, you should refuse to 'examine' them, saying that the patients cannot get out of bed, and let the Communist Party representatives come in. Each of you should nail nails on the wooden sticks at the ends of the canvas beds and hide them in the blankets. After the Communist Party representatives come in, jump up together at the command and give them a surprise attack!"

　　The returnees said that the activities of the special agent "Teacher Ma" were very extensive. He maintained close contact with the Kuomintang special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war in various camp areas of Dongchang-ri through Ge Yunfei, a special agent living in the "hospital" kitchen. On September 28th, the instructions he sent to Wang Shunqing, the commander of the first detachment, Ying Xiangyun, the commander of the third detachment, and others fell into the hands of returnee Qian Shunkun. In these instructions, he ordered the special agents in the camp area to send people to the "hospital" to make contact under the pretext of recuperating, stipulated clear contact signals between the detachments, and required the Indian troops to allow so-called "pastors" to enter the camp area, etc. On September 30th, special agents Ge Yunfei and Liu Lanping ordered Chang Feie to take a letter to Zhang Zunxian, the mastermind of the Zhang Zilong case in the 25th camp and the "principal" of the CIE "school." Chang Feie peeked at the letter on the way, and the content was: "On the instructions of Teacher Ma, tomorrow, October 1st, is the Communist Party's National Day, and we should not parade. Notify all camps to parade on the 2nd to oppose the 'examination' (referring to the explanation)!"

　　The returnees pointed out that this murderer "Teacher Ma," who wore the symbol of the US Eighth Army, was a veteran US special agent. He had been transferred from Taiwan to the "86th Detachment" on Geoje Island and the "3rd Detachment" on Jeju Island by the US military authorities to serve as a "teacher" for the CIE, a US special agent organization. After Harrison brought the Korean armistice negotiations to an indefinite recess last October, he returned to Taiwan. Before leaving, he said to Wang Futian, Zhang Zunxian, and other special agents in the POW camp: "Now the United States is going to take a tough stance. After I go back, I will come to pick you up with the Taiwanese National Army." He returned to the POW camp at the beginning of this year. Before the US handed over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Chang Feie personally heard him make an agreement with the special agents among the prisoners of war to come to the demilitarized zone. On September 24th, a US major took him to the Dongchang-ri POW hospital, and the US major introduced him, saying: "He is a Chinese and has come here to work as a translator." Special agent Ge Yunfei intimidated the prisoners of war, saying: "No one is allowed to call him 'Teacher Ma' in the future! When I talk to him, don't crowd around to listen."

　　The criminal activities of this Mr. Ma, a US-Chiang special agent, provide conclusive evidence that the US authorities are the masterminds behind all the crimes of the special agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp, including creating riots, murdering prisoners of war, preventing prisoners of war from coming out to accept explanations, and sabotaging the explanatory work.

### 美方提供的战俘营“医院”干了些什么

　　美方提供的战俘营“医院”干了些什么
    【新华社开城十四日电】十日遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员余辉如揭露美方特务在战俘营“医院”中的种种罪行，再次证实东场里所谓“医院”营区已成为美方特务迫害战俘和指挥破坏解释工作的场所。
    余辉如说：十月二十一日，志愿军被俘人员王宪章逃出东场里战俘营“医院”第四十四号营场申请遣返的当天晚上，又有四名战俘被加上“和王宪章共谋逃跑”的罪名，遭到特务的毒打。而王宪章本人也是在他的朋友王祥逃出营场申请遣返以后被特务分子以“和王祥共谋逃跑”的罪名加以吊打和决定判处“死刑”的。
    十月二十一日上午，王宪章爬出铁丝网以后，特务分子立即下令把帐篷帘子放下，不准任何人出去。特务邓鸿勋、胡克昌等则开会秘密商议。当天晚上，就由特务王俊生、徐林贵等把特务们所怀疑的庞斌、杨代发、康国祥、邬传友四人按倒在地板上，用帐篷杆子毒打，逼他们承认“和王宪章共谋逃跑”。最初他们没有叫，每人打了大约三十棒以后，他们开始喊叫起来，特务们就用毯子蒙住他们的头，然后把他们捆在床上，连大小便都不许出去。捆了有一个星期以后，特务们又让别的营场的特务派人把他们带走，后来就下落不明。
    余辉如说：特务们因为害怕战俘们听见中立国遣返委员会的广播后知道自己有遣返的权利，早就把广播器拆毁了。第四十四号营场的两个广播器，就被特务分子拆下来，蒙上雨布拼起来做成了一个鼓。
    余辉如也证实了台湾蒋匪派在战俘营“医院”中工作的特务“马老师”每星期都要到第四十四号营场（内科病房）里来两三次，和混在战俘中的特务邓鸿勋、胡克昌等秘密商谈，并传给他们许多“指示”和消息，然后再由特务邓鸿勋等把“指示”交给各联队“护送”战俘来看病的特务分子带到各个营场去。余辉如还记得的特务向战俘们传达过的“指示”和“消息”就有下面一些：（一）把屠杀张某的事件推到印度人身上，向印度人进行威胁，特务还说，“李总统”准备在必要时对印军使用武力；（二）强迫“医院”里的战俘装病拒绝听解释，如果解释代表进来，就用预先藏好的木棍、短刀袭击他们。
    余辉如说：“我本来希望解释工作赶快开始，好回到自己的祖国，可是特务们说根本不让‘医院’里的战俘听解释，又说：解释工作期已过了一半了。我心想：再不逃走，一辈子也回不了祖国了。五日那天晚上，我整夜没有合眼，后来看到坐在帐篷里监视我们的特务“警备队员”背对着我，我就偷偷溜出帐篷，用全部气力爬过铁丝网逃出了营场。”
    【新华社开城十四日电】从东场里战俘营“医院”营区翻铁丝网逃出来的志愿军归来人员一致证实：以美方“行政人员”身分在营区里面活动的台湾蒋匪特务“马老师”是十月一日残杀志愿军战俘张某的主谋者，这个特务分子并且一直在指挥战俘营中的其他特务破坏解释工作。
    在“医院”中的特务残杀战俘张某的前后，这个姓马的美蒋特务曾有过指示给凶手们。志愿军归来人员常飞锷（又名常中信）在十月二日战俘张某被杀的第二天，听见特务邓鸿勋对住在伙房的另一个特务葛云飞说：“昨天，我们打死了那个姓张的。‘马老师’曾指示我们把他饿死，不露一点痕迹。昨天我们趁打中立国人员的时候把他打死，并报告说是印度人打死的。”几天以后，归来人员王祥（当时为警备队员）又听到这个姓马的特务对邓鸿勋说：“以后发现可疑分子，先把他身上刺的字割掉，然后杀死。尸体可以埋在帐篷里的地下。如果印度人查问，就说翻铁丝网跑了。把割下来的肉交给我，我以后设法送到台湾去。”
    杀死战俘张某那天，在“医院”营区所发生的骚乱也是这个姓马的特务布置的。那天早晨，常飞锷曾听见他对特务葛云飞说：“今天中立国人员要来参观医院，你们要向波兰、捷克斯洛伐克代表扔石头！”
    这个姓马的特务还给营场内的特务分子带进了凶器和秘密文件。归来人员说，他在十月十一日拿了一把七八寸长的美国造匕首和一面国民党旗交给特务胡克昌，并说：“你们自己也要打几把刀子，小队长以上都要带刀子。”九月二十七日，他曾拿一本小书交给特务邓鸿勋。以后，特务们常常研究这本书。归来人员王宪章就听见邓鸿勋对其他特务说：“这些联络记号都要记住，要保密，用的时候要熟练迅速。”
    这个姓马的特务早在九月二十七日就亲自对“医院”营区第四十四号营场的特务邓鸿勋布置了反解释活动，他说：“共产党代表来时，你们就拒绝‘审查’，说病人不能起床，让共产党代表进来。你们每人把帆布床一头的木棒钉上钉子，藏在毯子里。共产党代表进来后，听口令一起跳起来打它一个冷不防！”
    归来人员说，特务“马老师”的活动非常广泛，他通过住在“医院”伙房中的特务葛云飞与东场里各营区混在战俘中的国民党特务保持着密切的联系。他在九月二十八日发给第一联队联队长王顺清、第三联队联队长应祥云等人的指示信曾落在归来人员钱顺坤手中。在这些指示信中，他命令营场内的特务派人以养病为名到“医院”联络，各联队之间规定明确的联络信号，要求印度部队准许所谓“牧师”进入营场等等。九月三十日，特务葛云飞和刘兰平曾命令常飞锷带一封信给二十五号营场中的张子龙案主谋者、ＣＩＥ“学校”“校长”张遵贤，常飞锷在路上偷看了一下，信的内容是：“奉马老师指示，明天十月一日是共产党国庆日，我们不应游行。通知各营场二日游行，反对‘审查’（即指解释）！”
    归来人员指出，这个佩带美国第八军符号的杀人犯“马老师”，是个老牌美国特务。他曾被美国军事当局从台湾调到巨济岛“八十六联队”和济州岛“三联队”担任美国特务组织ＣＩＥ的“教员”。去年十月哈利逊使朝鲜停战谈判陷于无限期休会以后，他曾回到台湾，临走时对战俘营中的特务分子王福田、张遵贤等说：“现在美国要采取强硬态度，我回去后要和台湾国军一起来接你们。”今年年初，他又回到战俘营。在美方把战俘交给中立国遣返委员会接管以前，常飞锷曾亲自听见他和战俘中的特务分子约定要到非军事区来。九月二十四日，一个美军少校把他带到东场里战俘医院，美军少校介绍说：“他是一个中国人，到这里来担任翻译工作。”特务葛云飞恫吓战俘说：“以后谁也不准叫他‘马老师’！我和他谈话的时候，大家不要挤在一起来听。”
    这个姓马的美蒋特务的罪恶活动，提供了一个确凿的证据，证明东场里战俘营中的特务分子制造暴乱、谋杀战俘、禁止战俘出来接受解释以及破坏解释工作的一切罪行的主使者正是美方当局。
