    In South Korea
    Terror and Slaughter Everywhere
    The Lee Syngman puppet regime, in order to intensify the persecution of the people, is formulating a new "security law" to sentence people to death on the "crime" of being "communists." According to Chen Xianzhi, the puppet government's Minister of Internal Affairs, the puppet government hopes that the puppet parliament will pass this "bill" before the opening of the political conference in order to use it to slaughter the people. At present, South Korea has become a world of terror, just as the "Indian Times" reporter said in a dispatch from Seoul on October 30: it is "a country full of political police."
    Workers Live Miserable Lives
    Due to soaring prices and low wages, the lives of South Korean workers have become very miserable. According to an article by Bo Lebolijin in the Soviet "News" magazine: "A worker works hard for twelve hours a day, and his wage income is 2,000 to 2,500 won (puppet currency)," while "a dou of rice (equivalent to 32 catties) costs 160,000 won." "In other words, an ordinary worker or clerk must work for four to five days to buy two pounds of rice."
    According to the Seoul puppet "Dongyang News Agency": Amid rising prices, the wages of workers in the six largest coal mines in South Korea, including Samcheok, Hwasun, Ningyue, Danyang, Munkyung, and Gyeongju, were withheld from August to November. Therefore, these coal miners issued a joint statement on November 5, unanimously demanding the immediate payment of wages.
    Hunger Becomes a Widespread Phenomenon
    Not long ago, Taylor Wood, the so-called "economic coordinator" sent by the United States to South Korea to manage "aid" to the Lee Syngman gang, admitted: "The scene in Seoul is a good picture of the poverty and disaster in South Korea, where the buildings are only empty shells, and the people there are sallow and thin." Indeed, hunger has become a widespread phenomenon in South Korea, especially among farmers. According to Associated Press reporter George MacArthur, farmers are so impoverished because "farmers have to pay heavy rents and taxes with their meager harvests, and they still have to pay the rents and taxes that have not been paid until now," that "farm tools have not been replaced for three years."
    Newspapers are Full of Suicide News
    Not long ago, the Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Okulov, estimating that there were more than one million unemployed people in South Korea, as well as more than 14 million semi-unemployed people and war victims. Hunger and poverty have made it impossible for them to continue living, and South Korean newspapers are filled with news of suicides every day. South Korea's "United News" reported that an unfortunate mother committed suicide by poisoning herself after drowning her young daughter, and another mother threw her baby into the fire and drowned herself in the river; another mother strangled her newborn baby and then committed suicide.
    War Orphans Exceed One Million
    In South Korea, more than one million war orphans are wandering the streets and have become beggars. In Busan alone, there are 10,000 homeless children. The streets of Seoul are full of hungry children who wander around looking for food and shelter, picking bread crusts from the trash cans outside the US military cafeterias. According to the puppet "Chosun Ilbo": Eight beggars around the Mapo Market in Seoul died a few hours after eating food they found in the US military trash cans.
      War Victims Demonstrate
    According to news from Seoul: On October 16, Lee Syngman held a "memorial service" for war deaths at the Seoul Stadium. Lee Syngman and US "Ambassador" Briggs, US Eighth Army Commander Taylor, and others attended. Of course, Lee Syngman originally intended to use this "crocodile tears" method to win people's hearts. But "contrary to expectations," during the meeting, the South Korean people who had suffered from the ravages of the US and Lee armies could no longer restrain their anger and rose up in demonstrations, as a result, the meeting had to be interrupted. Greatly disappointed, Lee Syngman was preparing to leave the venue when he was surrounded by a group of angry Korean women and old men. Only with the desperate struggle of the puppet police and guards did Lee Syngman escape from the venue in embarrassment.

    在南朝鲜
    到处是恐怖残杀
    李承晚傀儡政权为了加紧迫害人民，正在制订一项新的“安全法”，以便把人民加上“共产党”的“罪名”判处死刑。据伪政府内务部长官陈宪植说，伪政府希望伪议会能在政治会议开幕前通过这个“法案”，以便用这个“法案”来残杀人民。目前南朝鲜已成为恐怖世界，正像“印度时报”记者十月三十日自汉城发出的电讯中所说的：它是“一个到处是政治警察的国家”。
    工人生活悲惨
    由于物价飞涨、工资太低，南朝鲜工人的生活变得十分悲惨。据苏联“新闻”杂志波列伯里津的一篇文章报道：“一个工人一天拚命地工作十二小时，工资收入是二千至二千五百圆（伪币）”，而“一斗米（合三十二市斤）的价格是十六万圆。”“换句话说，也就是一个普通工人或小职员必须工作四至五天才能买两磅米。”
    据汉城伪“东洋通讯社”透露：在物价上涨声中，南朝鲜最大的三陟、和顺、宁越、丹阳、闻庆、庆州等六个煤矿的工人八月到十一月的工资都被扣发。因此，这些煤矿工人在十一月五日发表一个联合声明，一致要求立即发放工资。
    饥饿成了普遍现象
    不久以前，美国派到南朝鲜负责管理对李承晚匪帮“援助”的所谓“经济调配员”泰勒·伍德承认：“汉城的景象，就是表示南朝鲜贫困和灾难的一幅很好的图画，那里的建筑物只剩了空架子，那里的人们面黄肌瘦。”的确，饥饿已经成了南朝鲜的普遍现象，尤其是农民。据美联社记者乔治·麦克阿瑟报道，由于“农民要拿低微的收获物缴纳苛重的租税，还要补缴至今未能缴完的欠下的租税”，使得农民穷困到“农具三年都没有换新的了”。
    报上充满自杀新闻
    不久以前，苏联“真理报”上登了一篇奥库洛夫的文章，估计南朝鲜有一百多万失业者，还有一千四百多万的半失业者和战争受难者。饥饿和贫困已经使得他们无法继续生活下去，在南朝鲜的报纸上天天充满了自杀的消息。南朝鲜的“联合新闻”报道一位不幸的母亲在溺死她的幼女之后服毒自杀，还有一位母亲把她的婴儿扔到火里，自己投河而死；还有一位母亲在勒死了新生的婴儿以后也自尽了。
    战争孤儿超过百万
    在南朝鲜，有一百多万战争孤儿流浪在街头，成了乞儿。在釜山一地，就有一万名无家可归的流浪儿童。汉城街上到处是饥饿的儿童，他们徘徊着寻找食物和藏身的地方，在美军军用食堂外面的垃圾箱里拣面包皮吃。据伪“朝鲜日报”报道：汉城麻浦市场的周围有八名乞儿吃了在美军垃圾箱里找来的食物之后，过了几小时全部死掉了。
      战争受难者示威
    据来自汉城的消息说：十月十六日李承晚在汉城体育场举行了战争死亡者“追悼会”。李承晚和美国“大使”布里格斯、美国第八军军长泰勒等都来参加了。当然，李承晚原来是打算用这种“猫哭老鼠”的办法来笼络一下人心。可是“事与愿违”，会议进行中间，受尽美李军蹂躏的南朝鲜人民再也按捺不住自己的愤怒，群起示威，结果会议不得不被迫中断。大大扫兴的李承晚准备离开会场时，被一群愤怒的朝鲜妇女和老人包围了，由于伪警察和卫队的竭力挣扎，李承晚才狼狈地逃出会场。
