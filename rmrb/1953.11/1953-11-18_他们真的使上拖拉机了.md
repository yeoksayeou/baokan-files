    “They really got to use tractors!”
    Zhou Yixing
    During the autumn planting season, the tractors of the Fangqiu Lake Farm in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, helped the Li Shulan mutual aid team of Pubaogang Village cultivate twenty-six mu and five fen of land. This event caused an extraordinary change in the thinking of the farmers in Pubaogang Village.

    By the time I arrived at the Li Shulan mutual aid team, the machine cultivation had been over for several days, and I did not witness the grand occasion at the time. It is said that on that day, all the villagers came out to watch the machine cultivation around the edge of the fields, some went down to the fields to measure the furrows, marveling at how deep the tractor plowed; some dug open the planting furrows to see the seeds, praising how evenly the seeds were sown. Everyone was really happy to see it. After I arrived at the Li Shulan mutual aid team, I also deeply felt that there was a new atmosphere in their team. As soon as I met the deputy leader Li Shirong, he unexpectedly complained to me: "The land of the mutual aid team is too fragmented, two or three mu, it's too small." Judging from Li Shirong's expression, he was very dissatisfied with the scattered small plots of land. I thought: In other places, it is common to hear farmers say that the land is small and poor, but it is rare to hear farmers complain that two or three mu of land is too fragmented. I thought it was just Li Shirong who thought this way, but Li Shulan told me that many farmers in the village thought this way, and several mutual aid teams had discussed this issue. She said: "Our team has already made a plan to study and exchange some land with other teams this winter. It is estimated that exchanging dozens of mu of land to form a single piece will not be a problem."

    According to Li Shulan's experience, the attitude of the villagers towards mutual aid and cooperation is much more serious than before. She said: "Most of the eight mutual aid teams in our village are temporary, and for the past one or two years they have been 'cooperating and stopping, stopping and cooperating.' Now some team members are dissatisfied and say: 'We also have large tracts of land, why does the farm cultivate for the first team (Li Shulan's team) and not for us? It's because they cooperate well, we have to work harder and improve our mutual aid team.' The Fifth Mutual Aid Team is also a permanent team, and they are even more anxious, putting forward the slogan: 'Catch up with the First Team!' Also, my old uncle Li Changhe, who is sixty-four years old this year, used to be a 'staunch conservative' and once bet with someone, saying: 'If there is a combine harvester, I can cut off my head.' But a few days ago, he suddenly came to me and asked to join our team. I asked him why? He said: 'It seems that we can really use tractors, but our mutual aid team has not done a good job, and I don't know when we will get to use tractors!' My old uncle is now very enthusiastic and serious about the mutual aid team." Li Shulan was only talking about the affairs of other teams, but in fact, the enthusiasm in their team is even greater. All eleven households in their team have already agreed to establish an agricultural production cooperative with land shares.

    I asked Li Shulan: "What are you planning to do?"

    She suddenly seemed to remember something and smiled as she replied: "Didn't you also come to our team during the summer harvest? You also asked us 'What are your plans after seeing the farm's machines?' At that time, we said: 'We will buy a small tractor in the future and set up a cooperative.' That was a casual answer, and no one took it seriously, who could afford a tractor? Now we can use tractors without having to buy them, and we really have plans for mutual aid and cooperation: This year we plan to exchange some land with other teams, dozens of mu to form a single piece; and also build a public threshing ground. In the future, we will ask the farm's machines to cultivate these lands, and harvest and thresh together at harvest time, gradually cultivating the collective habits of the team members, and then we can implement land shares and the valuation of draft animals and farm implements to be owned publicly, and set up a cooperative."

    On October 24th, the small courtyard of Li Shulan's house was filled with farmers from the suburbs of Wuhu City. After visiting the Fangqiu Lake Farm, they also came to see the Li Shulan mutual aid team, the first to enjoy the use of tractors to help with cultivation. Deputy leader Li Shirong said when talking about the bright future: "This year we plan to exchange some of our land with other teams to form a single piece, and then use it uniformly, so that we can use machines to cultivate it next year. At that time, the use of machines for cultivation on the land will increase production; and a batch of labor, cattle and carts can be freed up to engage in sideline production regularly and accumulate more fertilizer. Anyway, there will be things to do, we won't be idle. At that time, our mutual aid team's income will increase, and our lives can really be improved." Li Shirong spoke of increasing production, increasing income, and improving life with such certainty and confidence. The visiting farmers were extremely envious, and on the way back, they said: "They are so lucky, they really got to use tractors."

    “他们真的使上拖拉机了”
    周一兴
    在秋种的季节里，安徽省凤阳县方邱湖农场的拖拉机，帮助蒲包岗村李树兰互助组耕种了二十六亩五分地。这件事情，在蒲包岗村农民的思想上，引起了不平常的变化。
    我到李树兰互助组的时候，机器代耕的事情，已经结束好几天了，没有看到当时的盛况。据说：那天村里人都出来围着田埂看机器耕作，有的下田量量犁沟，惊叹拖拉机犁得真深；有的扒开耩沟看看种子，夸赞种子下得真匀。大家看了，实在高兴。我到李树兰互助组后，也深深地感到他们组里有了一种新的气象。副组长李树荣和我一见面，就出我意外地埋怨说：“互助组土地零碎得很哪，二亩三亩的，太小了。”从李树荣的神气看来，他对分散的小块土地，很不满意。我想：在别的地方，听农民说地少地孬是有的，听农民埋怨二亩三亩地太零碎的倒少，以为是李树荣一个人这样，但李树兰告诉我：村里许多农民都这样想，几个互助组还讨论过这个问题。她说：“我们组已经计划好了，今年冬天和外组研究研究，互换一些土地，估计换几十亩地连成一片，是没问题的。”
    据李树兰的体会，村里农民对互助合作的态度，比以前认真得多了。她说：“我们村里八个互助组，大部分是临时性的，一、二年来一直‘互互停停，停停互互’。现在有些组员不满意了，说：‘我们也有大片土地，为什么农场给第一组（李树兰组）耕，不给我们耕呢？就因为人家互助得好，我们还得加油干，搞好互助组。’第五互助组也是个常年组，他们更加着急，提出口号：‘要撵上第一组！’还有我那老叔父李昌和，今年六十四岁了，过去是个‘老保守’，曾和人打赌说：‘要是有收割机的话，我头也可以砍掉。’可是前几天，他忽然来找我，要求跳到我们组来。我问他为什么？他说：‘看来真能使上拖拉机了，可是我们那个互助组没有搞好，使拖拉机还不知要到那天呢！’老叔父现在对互助组很热心、很认真哩。”李树兰尽在讲别组的事情，其实，他们组里的劲头更大。他们全组十一户，已经有十户同意办土地入股的农业生产合作社了。
    我问李树兰：“你们打算怎样办呢？”
    她忽然像想起一桩什么事情来了似的，笑起来回答我说：“午收时，你不也到我们组来过吗？也曾问我们‘看到了农场的机器，可有什么打算？’那时，我们说：‘将来买个小拖拉机，办个合作社。’那是随便回答的，谁也不当真，拖拉机有谁买得起呢？现在拖拉机用不着买就能使上了，我们对互助合作倒真的有了打算：今年准备和外组换些土地，几十亩连成一块；另外再搞一块公共的场子。将来这些地请农场的机器耕种，到收时共同收割和打场，慢慢地使组员们养成集体习惯，以后就可以实行土地入股和耕牛、农具折价归公，办起合作社来了。”
    十月二十四日，李树兰家的小院子里，坐满了芜湖市郊区的农民。他们在参观方邱湖农场后，也顺便来看看第一个享受到用拖拉机帮助耕种的李树兰互助组，副组长李树荣讲到美好的将来时说：“我们今年准备把一部分土地，跟外组互换，连成片，然后统一使用，到明年就可以用机器耕种了。那时候，在使用机器耕种的土地上，就会增加产量；还有一批劳动力、牛和大车，可以剩余下来，经常搞副业生产，多积肥料。反正有事情做，闲不了。那时，我们互助组的收入增加了，我们的生活也就真的可以改善哩。”李树荣把增加生产，增加收入，改善生活的大事，说得那样的有把握，有信心。参观的农民羡慕极了，回去时一路走，一路说：“他们真福气，真的使上拖拉机了。”
