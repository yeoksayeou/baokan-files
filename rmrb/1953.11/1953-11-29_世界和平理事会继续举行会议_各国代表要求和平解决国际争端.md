Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 28th: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the morning of the 26th, according to TASS.

    British representative Theodore Harris spoke, demanding guarantees for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    Colombian representative Salazar Santos said that the governments of most Latin American countries follow the orders of the U.S. State Department, support the United States in the United Nations, and refuse to recognize the People's Republic of China. This attitude does not reflect the opinions of the Latin American people at all.
    Cameroonian representative Jeanne Ebollo said that the Korean armistice has encouraged the people of various colonies to fight for peace and national independence, and it shows that the people of all countries can and must force the imperialists to end the war and begin peaceful negotiations.
    Portuguese representative Maria Lamas, in her speech, demanded that governments of all countries support the proposal to prohibit the use of weapons of mass destruction.
    Mongolian scientist Damdin Süren, representing the Mongolian people, supported Joliot-Curie's statement on holding a meeting of the five major powers as soon as possible. He expressed the Mongolian people's support for the heroic Korean people and called for an early convening of a political conference on the Korean issue with representatives from both warring parties and five relevant neutral countries.
    Soviet representative, Metropolitan Nikolai of Krutitsy and Kolomna, spoke at the meeting. He condemned the evil forces that are obstructing the negotiations to achieve peace in Korea and are trying to undermine the Korean armistice. He called on people of all faiths to join the struggle for peace. The participation of Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and followers of other religions in the struggle for peace would form a huge moral force against war. On behalf of the Russian Orthodox believers, he expressed that they, together with all the Soviet people, support the proposition of peaceful settlement of international issues, fair consultation, and holding a meeting of the five major powers. He demanded that all Christians and followers of other religions unite in the struggle to defend peace and against the aggressive actions of the enemies of peace.
    The famous Icelandic writer Halldór Laxness said that the entire Icelandic people are protesting against the stationing of American troops in their country. He hopes that one day the major powers will begin to discuss the issue of abolishing military bases on the territory of other countries.
    Chilean Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and writer Baltasar Castro said that in the past three years, there has been a movement in Chile demanding the revocation of the military treaty between the Chilean government and the United States. Chile is very concerned about expanding international economic and trade relations.
    Israeli representative Habibi supported the proposal to convene the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in 1954.
    Hungarian representative Professor Eizbert Andyche said that Hungarian peace fighters wholeheartedly support the movement demanding peaceful settlement of all international disputes through consultation, and support the movement of various countries against the rearmament of West Germany.
    The famous Cuban poet Guillén, who participated in the meeting as a guest, condemned the U.S. authorities for instigating the Cuban rulers to persecute peace fighters and democratic leaders.
    Algerian representative Smail Bourguida assured the meeting that the Algerian people are firmly opposed to dragging Algeria into the so-called "European Defense Community."
    Italian representative Professor Finota called on all honest European socialists to reject the "European Defense Community" treaty that the forces of war and aggression are trying to impose on them.
    In the afternoon of the 26th, the various committees established by the meeting held their meetings.
