    Soviet Union Releases German Prisoners of War Serving Sentences for Wartime Crimes Ahead of Schedule
    Former German Army Field Marshal Paulus Writes a Letter Upon Release Praising the Soviet Union's Peaceful Policies
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 2nd: TASS reports that according to the agreement concluded between the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic during the Moscow talks in August of this year, the Soviet Union has released and repatriated 5,374 German prisoners of war serving sentences for war crimes ahead of schedule, including several generals.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: TASS reports that Soviet newspapers published a letter from former German Army Field Marshal Paulus to the Soviet government on the 1st.
    Paulus was released during this repatriation of German prisoners of war by the Soviet Union. He is currently residing in the German Democratic Republic. Paulus wrote this letter to the Soviet government upon leaving the Soviet Union, stating:
    "As the Soviet government, in accordance with the joint communiqué issued by the Soviet government and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic on August 23, 1953, released German prisoners of war, I was able to end my life as a prisoner and return to my homeland. Before leaving the Soviet Union, I would like to say a few words:
    The Soviet government's generous decision of August 23rd regarding the issue of prisoners of war is new evidence that the Soviet government's policy towards Germany is not guided by a spirit of revenge because we launched a war that caused unspeakable suffering to the Soviet people. On the contrary, because the Soviet government is implementing a peaceful policy – a policy that is once again demonstrated by the aforementioned decision – it is easier than before for all German people to peacefully achieve the unification of Germany, that is, to move towards a better future.
    As the commander of the German forces during the Battle of Stalingrad, which determined the fate of my country, I fully understood all the horrors of a war of aggression – horrors experienced not only by the Soviet people who were subjected to our aggression, but also by my own soldiers. My personal experience and the results of the entire Second World War have convinced me that the fate of the German people cannot be built on a sense of racial superiority, but only on lasting friendship with the Soviet Union and all other countries. Therefore, I believe that the military agreements concluded by the West, based on a sense of racial superiority, are not an appropriate way to peacefully restore German unity and ensure peace in Europe. Moreover, these agreements will only deepen the dangers arising from the division of Germany and prolong the state of division.
    I believe that the only feasible way to peacefully unify Germany and achieve peace in Europe is to reach an agreement between Germans and conclude a peace treaty based on the Soviet note to the Western countries on the German issue on August 15th of this year.
    Therefore, I have decided to do my utmost after returning home to help achieve the following sacred goals: to unify Germany in a peaceful and democratic way, and to foster friendship between the German people and the Soviet people, as well as all other peace-loving nations.
    Before leaving the Soviet Union, I would like to tell the Soviet people: I once blindly obeyed orders and came to their country as an enemy; I will now leave this country as their friend."

    苏联提前释放因战时犯罪服刑的德国战俘
    前德军陆军元帅保卢斯被释时写信称颂苏联的和平政策
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林十月三十一日讯：根据苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府在今年八月莫斯科会谈中所缔结的协定，苏联提前释放并已遣返了五千三百七十四名因战时犯有罪行而服刑的德国战俘，其中有数名将级军官。
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联报纸一日刊载了前德军陆军元帅保卢斯给苏联政府的信。
    保卢斯是在这次苏联遣返德国战俘的时候被释放的。目前，他定居在德意志民主共和国。保卢斯在离开苏联时向苏联政府写了这封信。其中说：
    “由于苏联政府按照与德意志民主共和国政府代表团在一九五三年八月二十三日所发表的联合公报释放德国战俘，我得以结束俘虏生活回到我的祖国去。在离开苏联以前，我愿意说几句话：
    苏联政府今年八月二十三日关于战俘问题的慷慨决定是一个新的证据，说明苏联政府的对德政策并不因为我们发动战争，使苏联人民受到不可言状的痛苦而受报复情绪的指导。相反的，由于苏联政府执行和平政策——上述决定又一次地表现了这种政策——，所有德国人民要和平地实现德国的统一，也就是走向美好的将来，比以前更加容易了。
    我在决定我的国家的命运的斯大林格勒大战中指挥德国军队，这使我充分地了解到了侵略战争的一切恐怖——经验到这种恐怖的不仅是受我们侵略的苏联人民，还有我自己的士兵。我亲身的经验以及整个第二次世界大战的结果使我相信：德国人民的命运不能建筑在种族优越感上，只能建筑在与苏联以及所有其它国家的持久友谊上。所以，我相信，西方所缔结的，以种族优越感作为基础的军事协定不是和平恢复德国统一并确保欧洲和平的适当办法。而且，这些协定只会使因德国分裂而产生的危险加深，并使分裂状态拖延下去。
    我相信，和平统一德国与使欧洲得到和平的唯一切实可行的办法是：德国人之间达成协议，并根据今年八月十五日苏联就德国问题给西方国家的照会缔结和约。
    因此，我决定在回国以后尽我最大的力量来帮助达到以下神圣目标：以和平、民主方式统一德国、使德国人民与苏联人民以及所有其它爱好和平的民族友好。
    在离开苏联以前，我愿意告诉苏联人民：我曾盲目地服从命令，作为一个敌人来到他们的国家，我现在将作为他们的朋友离开这个国家。”
