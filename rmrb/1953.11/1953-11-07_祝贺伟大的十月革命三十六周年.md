Congratulatory Telegram from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries

To Chairman Denisov of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries:

On the occasion of the 36th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, extend the warmest congratulations and heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people, who are advancing towards the victory of communism with full confidence!

In the past four years, the Soviet government and people have provided a great deal of selfless assistance to our country's construction endeavors. Recently, the Soviet government has agreed to provide our country with systematic economic and technical assistance for the construction and reconstruction of 141 enterprises. This will play an extremely important role in our country's socialist industrialization and greatly encourage the Chinese people, further strengthening their confidence in striving for a gradual transition to socialism. The Chinese people deeply cherish the great and profound friendship of the Soviet government and people towards us and will more earnestly study the brilliant theories of Lenin and Stalin, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of selfless labor in building their motherland, and learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology to build our country. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will follow the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong and strive to continuously consolidate and develop the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and promote the study of the Soviet Union by the people of the whole country.

Long live the greatest and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
