    The Party's General Line during the transition period has presented the Party's organizational work with enormous tasks, because the Party's organizational work is the decisive guarantee for completing the Party's political line. As Comrade Stalin said, "When the correct line has already been put forward, when the problem has already been correctly decided, the success of the cause depends on organizational work, depends on the organizational struggle to realize the Party's line, depends on correctly selecting talents, depends on examining the implementation of the resolutions of various leading organs. Otherwise, the correct Party line and the correct resolutions will suffer serious losses." He also said: "In order to realize the correct political line, there is a need for cadres, there is a need for talents who understand the Party's political line, accept it as their own line, are determined to realize it, are good at effectively realizing it, are able to be responsible for it, are able to protect it, and are able to fight for it. Without this condition, the correct political line will inevitably become empty words on paper."
    Our Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is not only good at correctly formulating the Party's general line and general tasks in various revolutionary stages, but also good at correctly organizing the Party's strength to complete the general line and general tasks. After the Japanese aggressors surrendered in 1945, in order to prepare for the nationwide liberation, the Party transferred one-third of the Central Committee members, leading more than 20,000 cadres to the Northeast; in 1948 and 1949, in order to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in liberating the whole country, more than 100,000 cadres were successively transferred from various old liberated areas to the new areas, and the role of the local work teams of the field armies was particularly strengthened, ensuring the smooth liberation of the whole country and the smooth development of the restoration work in the new areas. Our Party is not only good at concentrating strength to complete the strategic tasks of the current stage, but also good at foreseeing the upcoming new strategic tasks and being able to prepare strength for it in a timely manner. Before the country was completely liberated, the Seventh Central Committee's Second Plenary Session held by our Party in March 1949 pointed out that the focus of our Party's work had shifted from the countryside to the cities, and a new era of cities leading the countryside had begun. Managing cities, especially restoring and developing industrial production, would become our Party's new strategic task. Later, with the expansion of the liberated areas, the Party Central Committee decided to gradually transfer a group of old cadres who were loyal to the cause of the working class, politically strong, and tested to state-owned industries, to serve as the leading backbone in leading the development of industrial construction. Before the country began planned economic construction, the Party foresaw that industrial cadres, especially leading backbone, must be prepared earlier, so that the old cadres who were originally unfamiliar with industry or did not understand industry at all could have one or two years to study in new jobs before the planned economic construction began, so that they could closely cooperate with the national economic construction plan. Therefore, in the past two years, the local Party committees have transferred nearly 70,000 major cadres from various work posts to work in industrial and mining enterprises, of which cadres at the county level and above accounted for one-tenth. As the industrial base of our country, the Northeast region, in the spring of 1949, although a large number of cadres were transferred to the customs with the army, and a large number of cadres were transferred to complete the land reform in the southern part of the Northeast region, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also decided to transfer nearly 1,000 old cadres above the county party secretary and county head level from various posts to industrial departments to serve as managers, factory directors, mine directors, party secretaries, and trade union chairmen. In the past few years, the growth of industrial cadres in the Northeast region has been very rapid. If the base number of industrial cadres in April 1949 is one hundred, it will reach one thousand and thirty-six by June 1953, more than ten times larger. This not only ensured that the Northeast region started planned economic construction early, but also played a great role in helping and promoting the restoration and development of industry in the whole country and in the whole country entering planned economic construction as soon as possible.
    In the past four years, the speed of our country's economic construction has been very fast. This proves that our Party's assessment of the Second Plenary Session is completely correct: although our country's economic heritage is backward, our people are brave and hardworking, our Party's leadership is strong, and the international assistance led by the Soviet Union is strong, so the speed of our country's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast. Now our country has rapidly entered the period of planned economic construction and started our country's first five-year plan. However, precisely because of this, our cadre preparation work for developing industry in the past few years is still not sufficient. Except for the Northeast region, in general, the old cadres transferred to the industrial field were transferred later and less. Therefore, this has aggravated our current task of allocating cadres for industrial construction.
    Now, the first year of our country's first five-year plan is about to be completed. Not only do many enterprises under construction need to be supplemented with a large number of cadres, but also many new enterprises, especially some projects among the 141 major constructions that the Soviet Union is helping us build, expand, and rebuild, have not yet been equipped with the necessary responsible cadres. The Soviet Union's great assistance to us not only requires us to provide the necessary design materials in a timely manner according to the plan schedule, but also requires us to strictly allocate the cadres needed for the construction of these enterprises according to the plan. It should be understood that in order to implement this great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance to our country, the Soviet Union has included this assistance plan in the Soviet Union's entire construction plan, and mobilized a large number of forces to accurately complete it on schedule. Therefore, if we delay the progress of these major constructions on schedule due to the slow allocation of cadres, it is very inappropriate. It should also be understood that most of the cadres we are about to transfer to industrial construction are not familiar with industry or do not understand modern industry at all. If they can be transferred out earlier to conduct some studies, and can consistently learn from Soviet experts from the beginning of the preparation to the successful construction of a major construction project, they will get very convenient conditions to start from scratch. If they insert halfway, it will not only increase the difficulty of their own learning, but also increase the difficulty for Soviet experts in helping to train them. We should also understand that the progress plan of each of our major construction projects is subject to the entire national construction plan. Any delay in an important construction will affect the realization of the entire national construction plan. Therefore, we must strictly allocate cadres in a timely manner according to the national plan, and cannot hinder the plan of the entire national construction due to the delay in cadre allocation.
    The large number of cadres we should transfer must be the Party's most outstanding cadres. Comrade Stalin said: "Any task, especially a huge task like the industrialization of our country, cannot be carried out without lively people, without new people, without new construction cadres. In the past, during the domestic war, what we especially needed were command cadres for building armies and fighting... Now, we have shifted from the front line of the domestic war to the industrial front line. To adapt to this, what we need now are new industrial command cadres... Without these people, we cannot move forward." According to our Party's fine tradition of allocating cadres, we can completely and quickly complete this major task. The Party committees at all levels can start working from the following aspects. First, conduct a unified investigation and registration of the main cadres above the prefectural committee level in the Party and government leading organs across the country, and formulate a plan for transferring those who are suitable to work in the industrial field to the industrial field in batches. Second, streamline administrative departments, and transfer as many cadres with suitable conditions as possible to work in industrial and mining enterprises. Third, various economic work departments should try their best to tighten up the upper-level leading institutions and draw out cadres to enrich the lower-level basic construction units and production units. Fourth, make necessary adjustments to the main cadres of existing factories and mines. Without hindering the principle of production management, experienced cadres should be drawn out in batches to strengthen the work of new factories and mines. Fifth, the economic construction departments and factory and mining units at all levels should boldly promote a large number of cadres from advanced technical workers and young intellectuals who have production experience, working ability, and development prospects, and universally set up deputy positions, so that under the leadership of old backbones, they can gradually become competent for production management and technical leadership through practical work exercises, so as to continue to draw out a large number of experienced cadres to support new construction. Sixth, we must cultivate and train a large number of new technical workers and new technical experts. The Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of technical worker schools and various training courses in industrial and mining units, strengthen the Party's leadership of higher technical schools and secondary technical schools, and continue to send students and interns to the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries to study, so that we can continuously increase a large number of new technical workers and technical experts with the progress of the national construction plan. Seventh, we must continue to unite and transform the original technical personnel, guide them to humbly learn from the Soviet Union, actively give play to their technical expertise, and continuously improve them, so that they can undertake more important work.
    As long as we conscientiously carry out our work from the above aspects, we can meet the needs of national construction for cadres. Of course, it is not without difficulties, it is not without struggle, it is not possible to complete it without in-depth and meticulous education and organization work to transfer outstanding cadres from all aspects to complete this huge task. It should be admitted that the cadres in other work posts are not very sufficient at present, and even many units also feel that they need to be supplemented; but this is only from the partial point of view of their own business development. If we compare the scale and speed of their business development with the overall requirements of the current national general line and general tasks, and compare them with the priorities of national construction in the first five-year plan, we can understand that our concentration of strength to strengthen industrial construction is completely in line with the overall interests of the country and the long-term interests of various departments. Therefore, we must make the greatest determination to transfer outstanding cadres from other departments with pain to strengthen the industrial front, and immediately expand this industrial construction army, so that it can have full confidence to complete our industrial construction plan. Whether or not to bear the pain and draw out a large number of outstanding cadres to support the industrial front is a concrete test of whether our Party committees at all levels in various regions and departments have truly implemented the spirit of the general line and general tasks, and whether we have implemented the spirit of everything being subordinate to the national construction plan not only in words but also in fact. Will the withdrawal of some outstanding cadres increase the difficulties for the regions and departments that are withdrawn? Yes, it will increase some difficulties. However, we have very rich experience in overcoming this kind of difficulty. As long as we are not people who bow to and retreat from difficulties, but people who dare to meet and overcome difficulties, we will give full play to our past fine traditions, and use effective methods such as streamlining administrative organs, improving work efficiency, boldly and exceptionally promoting cadres, and training cadres in practical work to overcome the difficulties that may arise after a part of the cadres are withdrawn. Moreover, for the work of the regions and departments that are withdrawn, it is better to withdraw old cadres earlier, so that new cadres can be promoted and exercised earlier, and a new work order can be established earlier.
    Of course, we should not disregard everything and withdraw all the outstanding cadres from other departments, and turn the focus into the only one. This is also wrong. Because the specific task of the first five-year plan is to concentrate the main forces to develop heavy industry, so as to establish the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization, and appropriately develop other economic, cultural and educational, and political and legal work accordingly; without the corresponding development of agricultural production of a large amount of food, without the training and cultivation of technical personnel and technical experts in cultural and educational aspects, ... and without the political and legal work to ensure social order, it is also inconceivable to build industry in isolation. Therefore, in this allocation and deployment of industrial cadres, we should also appropriately take care of other departments. For example, in order to take care of the development of agricultural production, the existing cadres in the county and district organs should generally not be transferred too much. Moreover, when transferring the responsible cadres of the prefectural level Party and government, we should not only transfer them in batches, but also leave two or three key prefectures in each province, so that they can grasp typical examples, create experience, and promote general areas in leading agricultural production. For example, when transferring old factory cadres to support new factories, we should not only take care of the development of old factory production, but also plan to leave a small number of factories and mines in each province and city to draw a few old backbones slowly, so as to accumulate experience in factory management. When allocating cadres, we should also appropriately take care of other regions and departments that really need to be supplemented with cadres under the principle of focusing on allocation. In addition, in this transfer of cadres, we should naturally pay attention to correcting the narrow-minded localism and conservatism that disregard the overall situation, correcting the phenomenon of unwillingness to withdraw the outstanding cadres that should be withdrawn, and correcting the phenomenon of discounting the quantity, quality and time of the withdrawn; however, we should also prevent and correct the rise of individualism and liberalism taking the opportunity. In the new period of national industrialization, many cadres are enthusiastic about participating in this work. This mood is good, but it is one thing for individuals to make requests, and another thing for leaders to approve. The principles on which the organization department decides who to transfer and who to leave are not mainly based on personal wishes, but on the overall interests of the country. Therefore, these workers should also be educated to obey the organization's distribution. Those who use the name of the country to achieve personal goals, and those who are not at ease with their current work because they have not been transferred, should be educated and criticized.
    The cadres who are transferred this time must implement the principle of focusing on allocation. Heavy industry is the focus, and the 141 major heavy industries that the Soviet Union is helping us build are the focus of the focus. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to give systematic economic and technical assistance in building and rebuilding China's ninety-one new enterprises and fifty enterprises under construction and reconstruction, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own strong heavy industry by learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements. This is of utmost importance to China's industrialization, to China's gradual transition to socialism, and to the strengthening of the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union." Allocating outstanding cadres to these 141 huge enterprises with emphasis will not only enable us to lay a solid material foundation for completing socialist industrialization, but also cultivate a cadre team that understands industrial construction and can guarantee the completion of socialist industrialization, and also develop rich scientific knowledge, technical talent, and management experience.
    Rapidly transferring outstanding cadres and focusing on allocating cadres to the industrial front is an important organizational task that enables us to complete the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period. Party committees at all levels, especially the organization departments of Party committees at all levels, should strive to complete this great task in a timely manner.

    迅速抽调大批优秀干部增强工业战线
    党在过渡时期的总路线给我们党的组织工作提出了巨大的任务，因为党的组织工作是完成党的政治路线的起决定作用的保证。正如斯大林同志所说：“当正确路线已经提出来了的时候，当问题已经正确决定了的时候，事业的成功就要取决于组织工作，取决于组织斗争来实现党的路线，取决于正确挑选人材，取决于审查各领导机关决议执行情形。如果不然，那么正确的党的路线和正确的决议就会遭到严重的损失。”他又说：“为了实现正确的政治路线，就需要有干部，就需要有懂得党的政治路线，把它当作自己的路线来接受，决意把它实现起来，善于切实把它实现起来，能够对它负责，能够保护它，能够为它而奋斗的人材。没有这个条件，正确的政治路线就不免要化为纸上空文。”
    我们党在毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，不只是善于正确地制订党在各个革命阶段的总路线和总任务，而且也善于正确地组织党的力量来完成总路线和总任务。一九四五年日本侵略者投降以后，党为了准备全国解放，曾抽调三分之一的中央委员带领二万多干部到东北；一九四八年和一九四九年为了配合解放大军解放全国，更先后从各个老解放区抽调了十万干部到新区，并特别加强了各野战军所起的地方工作队的作用，保证了全国顺利解放和新区恢复工作的顺利开展。我们党不只是善于集中力量来完成当前阶段的战略任务，而且也善于预见到即将到来的新的战略任务、能够及时为它准备力量。在全国还未完全解放以前，我党在一九四九年三月所举行的第七届第二次中央全会，就指出我们党的工作重心已经由乡村移到城市，开始了由城市领导乡村的新时期，管理城市特别是恢复和发展工业生产就将成为我党的新的战略任务。以后，随着解放区的扩大，党中央就决定陆续抽调一批忠实于工人阶级事业的、政治上坚强的、经过考验的老干部到国营工业中去，作为领导发展工业建设的领导骨干。在国家还未开始有计划的经济建设以前，党就预见到工业干部、特别是领导骨干必须早一步准备，以便原来不熟习工业或者根本不懂得工业的老干部能够在计划经济建设开始以前有一二年的时间在新的工作岗位上进行学习，才能与国家经济建设计划密切配合起来。因而在最近两年来各地党委从各种工作岗位上抽调到工矿企业中去工作的主要干部将近七万，其中县级以上的干部占十分之一。作为我国工业基地的东北地区，在一九四九年春，虽然抽调了大批干部随军进关，虽然抽调了大批干部去完成东北地区南部的土地改革，但是中共中央东北局同时也决定从各种岗位上抽调了近千名县委书记、县长以上的老干部分配到工业部门，去担任经理、厂矿长、党委书记、工会主席等重要职位。几年来东北区工业干部的增涨是很快的，如果以一九四九年四月工业干部的基数为一百，到一九五三年六月就达到一千零三十六，壮大了十倍还多。这就不只保证了东北地区提早开始了有计划的经济建设，而且对于帮助和推动全国工业的恢复和发展、对于全国及早进入有计划的经济建设都起了很大的作用。
    四年以来，我国经济建设的速度是很快的。这证明了我们党的二中全会的估计是完全正确的：我国经济遗产虽然是落后的，但我国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，我们党的领导是坚强的，以苏联为首的国际援助是强大的，因而我国的经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当快的。现在我国已迅速进入有计划的经济建设时期，开始了我国的第一个五年计划。但是，正因为这样，我们这几年来对发展工业所作的干部准备工作，就仍然表现了是不够充分的。除东北地区以外，一般说来调到工业方面去的老干部还是调得迟了一些，调得少了一些。因而这就给我们目前为工业建设调配干部加重了任务。
    现在，我们国家所进行的第一个五年计划的第一年已将完结，不只是很多正在建设的企业需要补充大批干部，而且很多新的企业、特别是苏联帮助我们新建、扩建和改建的一百四十一项巨大建设中的若干项目，直到现在还没有配备必要的负责干部。苏联对我们这些巨大的援助，不只是需要我们按照计划的日程及时地提供必要的设计资料，而且更需要我们严格按照计划来配备这些企业建设所需要的干部。应该了解，苏联为了执行对我国这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助，把这种援助计划列入了苏联整个建设计划当中，而且动员了大批的力量，来精确地按期完成，因而我们如果因为干部配备迟缓而延误了这些巨大建设的按期进展，那是很不应该的。还应当了解，我们即将抽调到工业建设上去的干部，大都不熟习工业或者根本不懂得现代化的工业，如果能早些抽调出来进行一些学习，能够随着一项巨大建设工程从开始筹备到建设成功，始终一贯地向苏联专家学习，就会得到从头学起的十分方便的条件，如果半路插上去，不只是给自己学习增加困难，而且也给苏联专家在帮助培养的工作上增加困难。我们更应当了解：我们每项重大建设工程的进度计划，都是服从于整个国家建设计划的，任何一项重要建设的延误，都会影响到整个国家建设计划的实现，因而我们必须严格地按照国家计划及时配备干部，不能因为干部配备的延迟而妨害整个国家建设的计划。
    我们应当抽调的大批干部必须是党的最优秀的干部。斯大林同志说：“任何一个任务，特别是像我们国家工业化这样的巨大任务，没有生气勃勃的人，没有新的人，没有新的建设干部，是不可能实行的。以前在国内战争时期，我们特别需要的，是建设军队和作战的指挥干部，……现在，我们已从国内战争的前线转到工业的战线上了。适应这点，现在我们需要的是新的工业指挥干部……没有这些人，我们是不能前进一步的。”根据我们党历来调配干部的优良传统，我们是完全可以迅速完成这一重大任务的。各地党委可以从以下几方面来着手工作。第一，统一调查登记全国各地党政领导机关中地委一级以上的主要干部，对于其中适宜于转到工业方面去工作的，应订出分期分批转入工业的计划。第二，精简行政部门，尽可能抽调一批条件适合的干部转入工矿企业去工作。第三，各经济工作部门应尽量紧缩上层领导机构，抽出干部充实下层基本建设单位和生产单位。第四，对现有厂矿的主要干部进行必要调整，在不妨害生产管理的原则下，应分期分批抽出有经验的干部去加强新建厂矿的工作。第五，各级经济建设部门和各厂矿单位，应从那些有生产经验、有工作能力、有发展前途的先进技术工人和青年知识分子中，大胆地破格地提拔大量干部，并普遍设立副职，使他们在老骨干的带领下，经过实际工作锻炼，逐渐胜任生产管理工作和技术领导工作，以便继续抽出大量有经验的干部去支援新的建设。第六，必须大量培养和训练新的技术工人和新的技术专家，各级党委应加强对工矿单位中技术工人学校和各种训练班的领导，加强党对高等技术学校和中等技术学校的领导，同时还应继续选派留学生和实习生到苏联和东欧人民民主国家去学习，使我们能够随着国家建设计划的进展不断增加大批新的技术工人和技术专家。第七，必须继续团结改造原有技术人员，引导他们虚心向苏联学习，积极发挥其技术专长，不断提高他们，使他们能够担当更重要的工作。
    只要我们认真从以上几方面去进行工作，我们是可以满足国家建设的干部需要的。当然，要从各方面抽调优秀干部来完成这一巨大的任务，不是没有困难的，不是没有斗争的，不是不经过深入细致的教育工作和组织工作就可以完成的。应该承认，目前其他工作岗位上的干部并不是十分充足，甚至有不少单位同样感到需要补充；但这只是从其本身业务发展的局部观点出发的，如果把其业务发展的规模和速度，与当前国家的总路线总任务的整体要求比较起来，把它和第一个五年计划中国家建设的重点来比较轻重缓急，就可以理解到我们集中力量加强工业建设是完全符合于国家整体利益和各部门长远利益的。因而就必须下最大决心从其他部门忍痛抽调优秀干部去增强工业战线，立即壮大这支工业建设大军，使它能够有充分把握来完成我们的工业建设计划。能否忍痛抽出大批优秀干部去支援工业战线，就是具体考验我们各地区各级党委和各部门是否真正地贯彻了总路线总任务的精神，考验我们是否不只在口头上而且在事实上贯彻了一切服从国家建设计划的精神。抽走了一些优秀干部，对被抽调的地区和部门来说，是不是会增加困难呢？是的，是会增加一些困难的。但是，我们在克服这种困难方面已有很丰富的经验，只要不是向困难低头后退的人，而是勇于迎击困难和克服困难的人，就会充分发挥过去的优良传统，就会用精简行政机构、提高工作效能、大胆地破格地提拔干部以及在实际工作中培养干部等等行之有效的办法，来克服抽走一部分干部以后可能产生的困难。而且这种干部的抽调，对被抽调地区和部门的工作来说，早抽比晚抽更好些，老的干部早日抽走，新的干部就可以早日得到提拔和锻炼，新的工作秩序也会早日建立起来。
    当然，我们也不应该不顾一切地把其他部门的优秀干部全部抽走，把重点变成唯一，这也是不对的。因为第一个五年计划的具体任务，是集中主要力量去发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，并相应地适当发展其他经济、文教和政法工作；没有相应发展的农业出产大量的粮食，没有文教方面训练和培养技术人员和技术专家，……以及没有政法工作保证社会秩序，孤立地建设工业也是不可设想的。所以在这次抽调和配备工业干部时，也应该适当地照顾其他部门，比如为了照顾发展农业生产，对于县区机关现有的干部，就一般不作过大的调动，而且在抽调专区级党政负责干部时，不只要分批分期抽调，而且也应每省留下两三个重点专区，使他们在领导农业生产上能够掌握典型、创造经验、推动一般地区。比如在抽调旧厂干部支援新厂时，不只应照顾发展旧厂的生产，也应有计划地在每一省市留少数厂矿少抽和慢抽一些老骨干，以便积累管理工厂的经验。在配备干部时，也应在重点配备的原则下适当照顾其他确实应该补充干部的地区和部门。另外，在这次抽调干部中，自然应注重纠正不顾全局的本位主义和保守思想，纠正那种不愿把应抽走的优秀干部抽走的现象，纠正那种在抽走的数量、质量和时间上去打折扣的现象；但是，同时也应防止和纠正个人主义和自由主义趁机抬头。在国家进入工业化的新时期，很多干部热烈要求参加这一工作，这种情绪是好的，但是个人提出要求是一回事，领导批准又是一回事。组织部门决定抽调那些、留下那些，所依据的原则主要不是个人的意愿，而是国家的整体利益。因而也应教育这些工作人员服从组织分配，对于那种假借国家的名义来达到个人目的的人，对于那种因为没有调走就不安心现在工作的人，都应进行教育和批评。
    这次抽调出来的干部一定要贯彻重点配备的原则。重工业是重点，苏联帮助我们建设的一百四十一项重工业又是重点的重点。毛泽东同志说：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”把优秀的干部有重点地配备在这一百四十一项巨大企业中去，就不只会使我们能够为完成社会主义工业化打下巩固的物质基础，而且也会为我们培养出能够保证完成社会主义工业化所必须的懂得工业建设的干部队伍，还会为我们锻炼出丰富的科学知识、技术才能和管理经验。
    迅速抽调优秀干部、重点配备干部到工业战线上去，就是使我们能够完成党在过渡时期的总路线总任务的重大的组织任务，各级党委、特别是各级党委组织部门应为及时完成这一伟大任务而奋斗。
