    Raising the Ideological Level of Increase Production and Practice Economy Propaganda
    Shí Xīn

    The broad and deep development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement encompasses a series of ideological struggles: the struggle between advanced and conservative thinking, the struggle between holistic and localized viewpoints, the struggle between comprehensive and one-sided viewpoints, the struggle between the idea of obeying the national plan and blindness and spontaneous tendencies, and so on. The newspaper is a powerful ideological weapon. Its major responsibility in Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda lies in: deeply elucidating the significance and methods of Increase Production and Practice Economy, constantly improving the understanding of cadres and the masses, overcoming various ideological obstacles, and promoting the movement to advance in the correct direction, based on the Party's guidelines and policies and tailored to the specific local conditions. For this purpose, the newspaper should actively and proactively discover vivid examples emerging from life and use them to educate the broad masses to "catch up with the better ones and achieve a universal upsurge" (Stalin: "The Competition of the Masses and the Upsurge of Labor Enthusiasm"). For this purpose, the newspaper should also repeatedly and promptly reveal and criticize various ideological problems in Increase Production and Practice Economy, and fight against all obstacles affecting the smooth development of this movement. In general, the Northeast Daily and the Changchun New News attach more importance to this ideological mobilization work.

    In Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda, in addition to positively expounding on the great significance and correct methods of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement in Northeast China, and continuously reporting on advanced units such as the "May 3rd" Factory as typical examples, the Northeast Daily has paid attention to raising problems existing in the movement and solving them, based on the local work situation and the ideological situation of cadres and the masses. For example, at the beginning of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, some units in Shenyang, Harbin, and other places were slow to act and lacked enthusiasm. In response to this situation, the Northeast Daily successively published commentaries such as "Quickly Launch the Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition" and "Let the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan Meet the Masses" in early September, analyzing the special significance and urgency of carrying out this movement this year, criticizing the practice of mechanically dividing stages and preparing slowly, and proposing that "at any time, the working method should be determined according to the actual situation." The Increase Production and Practice Economy competition must be combined with strengthening management work in order to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan. In order to implement this policy, the Northeast Daily opposed various one-sided viewpoints and wrong practices. Taking basic construction as an example, on October 10th, it exposed the tendency of many construction sites in Fushun City to only focus on speeding up progress and ignoring project quality, resulting in an increase in quality accidents, pointing out that this wrong practice ran counter to the spirit of the Increase Production and Practice Economy competition, and would not only fail to meet the requirements of Increase Production and Practice Economy, but would also bring irreparable losses to the country. On October 21st, through specific examples, it criticized some cadres for using the excuse that "achieving good and fast engineering is the biggest saving," and therefore not paying attention to saving, as well as thinking that "when building a big building, there is always some waste, even eating will drop rice grains!" and other one-sided viewpoints, pointing out that the result of this kind of thinking and practice would inevitably be to relax saving, encourage waste, and hinder us from saving every bit of wealth to accumulate industrialization funds for the country. On October 31st, the Northeast Daily exposed the adverse consequences of the third construction section of the technical school construction site of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company Civil Engineering Company and the third construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau adopting overtime methods to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy competition, which damaged the health of workers and affected the quality of the project, proving with definite facts the error of leaving aside the strengthening of management work and simply working overtime. The newspaper repeatedly criticized one-sided viewpoints and opposed wrong practices, and also vigorously adhered to the correct policy.

    In terms of agricultural production, the Northeast Daily closely grasped the spirit of doing a good job in autumn harvest and increasing grain harvest, and launched struggles in two aspects. On the one hand, through examples such as the loss of fifty to sixty *shi* of grain in the autumn harvest in Jiangjia Weizi Village, the second district of Tuanjie Village, Durbet Banner, Heilongjiang Province, due to the abandonment of leadership by district and village cadres, it criticized the idea of some cadres who believed that "autumn harvest does not need leadership" and "a little grain loss in autumn harvest is nothing"; and through examples such as Shahu Village, Hailin County, Songjiang Province, only paying attention to careful harvesting and cutting, but wasting a lot of grain in hauling and threshing, it criticized the slack and complacent attitude of some cadres after the crops were harvested, and educated them to lead farmers to deeply carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy in grain movement, and to regard it as a long-term task. On the other hand, the newspaper exposed the tendency of some village cadres in the third district of Baiquan County to ask farmers to "tighten their belts, drink some thin porridge, and save money," and criticized the wrong practice of regarding Increase Production and Practice Economy as negative belt-tightening. In this way, the newspaper specifically pointed out the correct path for carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement in rural areas.

    In order to eliminate ideological obstacles in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, the Northeast Daily also focused on carrying out the struggle against departmentalism and bureaucracy. The newspaper exposed the incident of the Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Industry Administration falsely reporting the number of people, fraudulently claiming fine grain, and stockpiling coarse grain on October 18th; and exposed the incident of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry forging project settlement accounts in 1952 while undertaking the project of the Northeast Institute of Technology, attempting to defraud huge profits exceeding the state regulations on November 5th. When exposing these incidents, the newspaper published short comments, sharply criticizing the error of this behavior that harmed the interests of the country. The newspaper wrote: "Departmentalism and lack of organization and discipline are the great enemies of planned economic construction and the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement carried out to realize the construction plan, and must be resolutely eradicated." The incident exposed by the Northeast Daily on October 26th, in which the leading cadres of the Fengcheng County Grain Storage and Transportation Company had serious bureaucratic work styles, and sat idly by as more than 100 train cars (totaling 6.24 million *jin*) of rice heated up and deteriorated, was also a typical incident. The newspaper used this incident to attract the broad masses of readers to participate in the struggle against damaging state property and wasting grain. Many readers wrote letters to the newspaper, expressing their intention to learn from this incident, and to check and improve the storage of grain and other materials. Obviously, the exposure of these typical incidents is a vivid education for the broad masses.

    In Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda, the Changchun New News also paid attention to using typical examples to conduct ideological struggles. The criticism made by the newspaper on the conservative and complacent thinking of the leading cadres of units such as the Changchun Clothing Factory and the Changchun Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory was convincing. The leading cadres of the Changchun Clothing Factory did not make a comprehensive analysis and understanding of the real situation of their enterprise, nor did they mobilize the masses to discuss it, but emphasized objective difficulties and set a very conservative Increase Production and Practice Economy plan. The clothing workshop, the main workshop of the factory, did not have an increase production task, on the grounds that "the Changchun Department Store Wholesale Station and the department store did not come to process orders." In fact, the factory's operation and management was poor, the processing fee was 30% higher than other processing units, and the product quality was poor. More than 1,000 pairs of worsted wool serge trousers processed for the Changchun Department Store Wholesale Station were reworked. The Changchun New News exposed this situation on September 23rd and published a commentary, criticizing the conservative thinking of not focusing on improving operation and management, and not relying on and mobilizing the broad masses of workers and employees, but simply emphasizing objective difficulties; pointing out that this is the main ideological obstacle in leading the Increase Production and Practice Economy competition at present, and must be overcome. The leading cadres of the Changchun Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory, because they saw that the relays produced by the factory had always been in short supply, and that they would be able to complete the annual production plan by mid-October, developed a blind sense of complacency; therefore, the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan formulated by the factory was even lower than the normal production level. According to the past production situation, products worth 1.425 billion *yuan* could be produced in the two and a half months to the end of the year, but the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan formulated by the factory was 1.4 billion *yuan*. This is clearly an irresponsible attitude towards the country and the people. The Changchun New News made a sharp criticism of this "unmotivated Increase Production and Practice Economy plan" on September 25th. The newspaper's forceful criticism of the main problems in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement has played a great role in promoting the current work. For example, after being criticized by the newspaper, the leading cadres of the Changchun Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory checked their blind sense of complacency, mobilized workers and employees, and tapped potential forces. As a result, they re-formulated an Increase Production and Practice Economy plan of 3.3 billion *yuan* and greatly promoted the enthusiasm of workers and employees; Gao Wenzhang, the leader of the group, found three tricks by himself, one of which could improve work efficiency by more than 30 times. As the Changchun New News pointed out in its commentary on this matter on October 14th, "Without criticism and self-criticism, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and employees cannot be fully exerted; without criticism and self-criticism, all difficulties that can be overcome and must be overcome cannot be overcome in time."

    The practices of the Northeast Daily and the Changchun New News show that timely revealing and solving various ideological problems in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with the current work, is an important condition for continuously improving the understanding of cadres and the masses, mobilizing the broad masses to take active action, and also an effective method for making the newspaper's Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda rich in ideology and combat effectiveness. This requires our newspapers to not be satisfied with generally propagating the principles of Increase Production and Practice Economy, not be satisfied with the average figures of various enterprises completing the national plan, and not be satisfied with the outstanding achievements of advanced regions, advanced units, and advanced figures, but to go deep into life, analyze various specific contradictions, and specifically solve them by grasping their essential aspects. "It should be known that our development is not a smooth and steadily upward advance. No, comrades, we still have classes here, we still have various contradictions within our country, we have the past, we have the present and the future, and there are various contradictions between them, so we cannot move forward smoothly in the tide of life. Our progress is carried out in struggle, in the development of contradictions, in overcoming these contradictions, and in exposing and eliminating these contradictions." ("Stalin on Criticism and Self-Criticism," page 20, People's Publishing House edition) Obviously, as an ideological weapon, the newspaper should not avoid various contradictions in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, but should boldly unfold these contradictions and resolutely overcome them. Judging from the lack of criticism and self-criticism in some newspapers in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, the propaganda of these newspapers lags behind the requirements of the actual development of the movement. As the Northeast Daily pointed out in its newspaper review on the Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda of the Changchun New News on October 13th: "Here, we must also mention the issue of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper. Recently, most newspapers seem to have forgotten about this. There are still few newspapers that implement criticism and self-criticism in the reports of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement like the Changchun New News. It must be recognized that carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper is a regular and important task, and all newspapers must combine the current Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper, and implement the spirit of the anti-bureaucracy struggle." Closely combining the spirit of the anti-bureaucracy struggle with the current work, and paying attention to the regularization of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, is something that newspapers in various places should pay attention to at all times.

    Of course, it is not to say that the Northeast Daily and the Changchun New News have no shortcomings in this aspect of propaganda. For example, the Northeast Daily reflects and solves more leadership ideological problems, but reflects and solves relatively weak mass ideological problems; before criticizing the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan formulated by the Changchun Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory as "an unmotivated Increase Production and Practice Economy plan," the Changchun New News inappropriately introduced the situation of the factory formulating the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan on September 17th. This shows that the above-mentioned newspapers still have shortcomings in going deep into reality. These situations raise the following requirements for our newspapers: with the deepening of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement and the increasing enrichment of the content of Increase Production and Practice Economy, we must more deeply connect with reality and connect with the masses, on the one hand, vigorously publicize specific and effective examples, and on the other hand, resolutely oppose all obstacles that hinder us from completing the task of Increase Production and Practice Economy, and improve the ideological level of our newspaper's Increase Production and Practice Economy propaganda a step further.

    提高增产节约宣传的思想水平
    湜　辛
    增产节约运动的广泛、深入的开展，包含着一系列的思想斗争过程：先进思想和保守思想的斗争，整体观点和局部观点的斗争，全面观点和片面观点的斗争，服从国家计划的思想和盲目性及自发倾向之间的斗争，等等。报纸是强有力的思想武器。它在增产节约宣传中的重大责任就在于：依据党的方针政策，针对当地的具体情况，深刻地阐明增产节约的意义和作法，不断提高干部群众的认识，克服各种思想障碍，推动运动朝着正确的方向前进。为了这个目的，报纸应当积极地主动地发掘生活当中涌现出来的生动范例，用以教育广大群众“要赶上更好的并要达到普遍的高涨”（斯大林：“群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”）。为了这个目的，报纸还应当反复地及时地揭示和批判增产节约中的各种思想问题，向影响这一运动顺利开展的一切障碍作斗争。一般说来，东北日报和长春新报是比较重视这种思想发动工作的。
    东北日报在增产节约宣传中，除从正面阐述了东北地区开展增产节约运动的重大意义和正确作法，并以“五三”工厂等先进单位为典型进行了连续报道外，曾注意根据当地工作情况和干部群众的思想情况，提出运动中存在的问题，并加以解决。例如当增产节约运动开展之初，沈阳、哈尔滨等地某些单位动作迟缓、劲头不大。东北日报针对这种情况在九月上旬连续发表了“迅速开展增产节约竞赛”和“快让增产节约计划和群众见面”的评论，分析了今年开展这一运动的特殊意义及其迫切性，批判了那种机械划分阶段、慢腾腾地进行准备工作的作法，提出“任何时候，都应该根据实际情况决定工作方法”。增产节约竞赛必须和加强管理工作相结合，以达到全面地超额完成国家计划的目的。为了贯彻这一方针，东北日报反对了各种各样的片面观点和错误作法。以基本建设为例，十月十日，就曾揭露了抚顺市不少工地只顾赶进度而忽视工程质量，以致质量事故增多的偏向，指出这种错误作法是和增产节约竞赛精神背道而驰的，非但不能达到增产节约的要求，反而会给国家带来不可弥补的损失。十月二十一日，又通过具体事例，批判了某些干部藉口“工程达到好、快，就是最大的节约”，因而不注意节约，以及认为“盖大楼嘛，还有一点不浪费的，吃饭还会掉饭粒呢！”等片面观点，指出这种想法和作法的结果，必将是放松节约，助长浪费，妨碍我们节省一点一滴的财富来为国家积累工业化资金。十月三十一日，东北日报又揭露了本溪钢铁公司土建工程公司技术学校工区三工段和有色局第二工程公司三工地采用加班加点方法开展增产节约竞赛所造成的损害工人健康、影响工程质量的恶果，以确切的事实证明了离开加强管理工作、单纯加班加点的错误。报纸反复地批判片面观点，反对错误作法，也就有力地坚持了正确的方针。
    在农业生产方面，东北日报紧紧掌握了做好秋收、增加粮食收获量的精神，开展了两方面的斗争。一方面，通过黑龙江省杜尔伯特旗团结村二区姜家围子屯由于区村干部放弃领导，以致全屯秋收中糟损粮食五、六十石等事例，批判了某些干部认为“秋收不用领导”、“秋收中糟损粮食一星半点不算啥”的思想；又通过松江省海林县沙虎村只重视细收细割而在拉地、打场中却浪费了很多粮食等事例，批判了某些干部在庄稼上场后的松劲自满情绪，教育他们领导农民深入开展增产节约粮食运动，并把它作为长期的任务。另一方面，报纸揭露了拜泉县三区某些村干部要求农民“紧紧肚子，喝点稀粥，也得节约”的偏向，批判了那种将增产节约当成消极的节衣缩食的错误作法。这样，报纸就具体地指明了在农村中开展增产节约运动的正确道路。
    为了扫除增产节约运动中的思想障碍，东北日报还着重进行了反对本位主义和官僚主义的斗争。报纸曾在十月十八日揭发了黑龙江省森林工业管理局虚报人数、冒领细粮、积压粗粮的事件；又在十一月五日揭发了重工业部建设工程公司一九五二年在承修东北工学院工程中，伪造工程决算、企图骗取超过国家规定的巨额利润的事件。报纸在揭发这些事件时，都曾发表短评，尖锐地批判了这种危害国家利益行为的错误。报纸写道：“本位主义和无组织无纪律是有计划经济建设和为实现建设计划而开展的增产节约运动的大敌，必须坚决铲除”。十月二十六日东北日报揭发的凤城县粮谷储运公司领导干部官僚主义作风严重，坐视一百多火车（计六百二十四万市斤）大米发热变质的事件，也是一个典型事件。报纸通过这个事件吸引了广大读者参加反对损坏国家财产和浪费粮食行为的斗争。许多读者给报社写信，表示要接受这一事件的教训，检查改进粮食及其他物资的保管工作。显然，这类典型事件的揭发，对于广大群众是一种生动的教育。
    长春新报在增产节约宣传中，也曾注意运用典型事例来进行思想斗争。该报对长春服装厂和长春电气器材制造厂等单位领导干部的保守、自满思想所作的批评，就是富有说服力量的。长春服装厂领导干部对自己企业的真实情况既不作全面的分析和了解，又不发动群众讨论，而是强调客观困难，将增产节约计划订得很保守。该厂主要车间服装车间竟没有增产任务，理由是“长春百货批发站和百货公司不来加工订货”。实际上该厂经营管理不善，加工费比其他加工单位高出百分之三十，而且产品质量低劣，替长春百货批发站加工的哔叽西服裤子就返工一千多条。长春新报在九月二十三日揭发了这一情况，并发表评论，批判了那种不从改善经营管理着眼，不依靠和发动广大职工群众，单纯强调客观困难的保守思想；指出这是当前领导增产节约竞赛中的主要思想障碍，必须加以克服。长春电气器材制造厂领导干部则因看到该厂生产的继电器一直供不应求，到十月中旬即能完成全年生产计划，便产生了盲目自满情绪；因此该厂制订的增产节约计划比正常生产水平还低。即按过去生产情况，到年底的两个半月中可生产十四亿二千五百万元的产品，但该厂制订的增产节约计划却是十四亿元。这显然是一种对国家和人民不负责任的态度。长春新报在九月二十五日对这“一个没有积极性的增产节约计划”进行了尖锐的批评。报纸针对增产节约运动中的主要问题进行有力的批评，对于推动当前工作是有很大作用的。如长春电气器材制造厂领导干部经报纸批评后，便检查了自己的盲目自满思想，发动职工群众，挖掘了潜在力量，结果重新制订出增产节约三十三亿元的计划，并且大大发挥了职工的积极性；小组长高文章一个人就找到三个窍门，其中一个窍门就可提高工作效率三十多倍。正如长春新报十月十四日评论此事时所指出的，“如果没有批评和自我批评，广大职工群众的积极性就不能充分发挥；如果没有批评和自我批评，一切可以克服而也必须克服的困难就不能及时克服”。
    东北日报和长春新报的作法表明：及时地揭示和解决增产节约运动中的各种思想问题，结合当前工作开展批评和自我批评，是不断提高干部群众的认识，动员广大群众积极行动起来的一个重要条件，也是使得报纸的增产节约宣传富于思想性和战斗性的一个有效方法。这就要求我们的报纸不满足于一般地宣传增产节约的道理，不满足于各个企业完成国家计划的平均数字，也不满足于先进地区、先进单位、先进人物的优异成绩，而应当深入生活，分析各种各样具体的矛盾，并抓住其本质的方面加以具体解决。“要知道我们的发展并不是平平稳稳、一直上升地前进的。不，同志们，我们这里还有阶级存在着，我们国家内部还有各种矛盾，我们有过去的东西，我们有现在的东西和将来的东西，它们之间有各种矛盾，因此我们就不能在生活浪潮中一帆风顺地前进。我们的前进是在斗争中、在矛盾底发展中、在克服这些矛盾中、在揭露和消灭这些矛盾中进行的。”（“斯大林论批评与自我批评”，第二十页，人民出版社版）显然，作为思想武器的报纸，在增产节约运动中不应回避各种矛盾，而应该大胆地展开这些矛盾并坚决克服它。从某些报纸在增产节约运动中缺乏批评和自我批评的情况看来，这些报纸的宣传是落后于实际运动发展的要求的。正如东北日报在十月十三日所发表的关于长春新报增产节约宣传的报纸述评中指出的一样：“这里不能不附带提出关于在报纸上开展批评和自我批评的问题。最近，多数报纸似乎又忘记了这件事。像长春新报那样在增产节约运动报道中贯彻批评和自我批评的，还是少数。必须认识：在报纸上展开批评和自我批评，是一件经常的重要任务，各报必须结合当前增产节约运动，在报纸上切实开展批评和自我批评，贯彻反官僚主义斗争的精神。”把反官僚主义斗争的精神密切结合当前各项工作，注意开展批评和自我批评的经常化，是应该引起各地报纸时刻注意的。
    当然，并不是说东北日报和长春新报在这一方面的宣传就没有缺点。例如东北日报反映和解决领导思想问题较多，反映和解决群众思想问题则比较薄弱；长春新报在批评长春电气器材制造厂制订的增产节约计划是“一个没有积极性的增产节约计划”之前，曾在九月十七日不适当地介绍了该厂制订增产节约计划的情况。这就说明了上述报纸在深入实际方面还有不足之处。这些情况向我们报纸提出的要求是：随着增产节约运动的深入开展和增产节约内容的日益丰富，更深入地联系实际联系群众，一方面大力宣扬具体有效的范例，另一方面坚决反对阻碍我们完成增产节约任务的一切障碍，把我们报纸增产节约宣传的思想水平提高一步。
