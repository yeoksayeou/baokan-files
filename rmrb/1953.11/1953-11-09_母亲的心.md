    A Mother's Heart
    Shao Nan
    The wind in North Korea has not yet turned cool; the trees in North Korea have not yet turned yellow. Homeland!
    My dear mother! The cotton clothes you personally sewed, crossing thousands of mountains and rivers, have been transported to your child's side again. Homeland! My dear mother, thousands of mountains and rivers are not too far, thousands of mountains and rivers are not too long, the mother's hands, with thousands of stitches and threads, are connected to the front line, the mother's heart is always concerned about her child's warmth.

    母亲的心
    邵南
    北朝鲜的风，还没有变凉；北朝鲜的树，也没有变黄。祖国啊！
    我的亲娘！你亲手缝制的棉衣，翻千山涉万水啊，又运到了孩儿
    的身旁。祖国啊！我的亲娘，千山万水不嫌远，千山万水不嫌长
    ，母亲的手啊，千针万线联系着前方，母亲的心啊，时时刻刻挂
    念着孩儿的温凉。
