    Facilitating Farmers' Payment of Agricultural Tax
    Hebei Province Collects Peanuts in Kind in Peanut Production Areas
    In order to facilitate farmers' payment of agricultural tax and ensure the completion of the state's fourth-quarter purchase plan, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, in accordance with the spirit of the 1953 agreement on agricultural product tax collection in kind issued by the Central Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, has decided to collect a portion of peanuts in major production areas within the province. The collection work in various regions is generally scheduled to begin in late November this year and end in mid-December.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the collection work, the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance, Department of Commerce, State-owned Oil Company, and Federation of Cooperatives have decided to establish peanut collection stations in key districts and townships of the counties in the production areas, based on specific circumstances. The collection stations will be staffed by cadres selected by local finance departments, state-owned oil companies, and cooperatives. The location of the stations will primarily be based on facilitating farmer payments and cargo transportation. For those who are far from the station and exceed the prescribed mandatory transportation mileage, the state will provide transportation fees for the excess portion.

    In terms of the types of peanuts collected, the focus will be on collecting peanut kernels. Areas without the habit of shelling peanuts may pay with peanut pods. In order to implement the principle of fairness and reasonableness and to facilitate calculation, peanut kernels are divided into three grades: Grade A, Grade B, and raw goods, with prices set according to grade. Peanut pods are converted according to the amount of kernels produced and the grade of the kernels. All calculations will be based on the local company's purchase price as the standard.

    The collection stations in various regions have decided to invite farmer representatives, under the leadership of the Party and government, to form evaluation groups to assist in checking the quality grade and to supervise the grading, pricing, weighing, and other aspects. In addition, necessary preventive and handling measures have been formulated for possible accidents such as injuries to people and animals, and damage to vehicles and ships. (Zhang Bingqian)

    便利农民缴纳农业税
    河北省花生产区征收实物
    为便利农民缴纳农业税，保证第四季度国家收购计划的完成，河北省人民政府特根据中央财政部、商业部、中华全国合作总社一九五三年关于农产品征实协议的精神，在省内各主要产区征收一部分花生。各地征实工作一般都决定在今年十一月下旬开始，至十二月中旬结束。
    河北省人民政府财政厅、商业厅、国营油脂公司及合作总社为使征实工作顺利进行，决定根据具体情况，在产区各县的重点区、乡设立花生征收站。征收站由各地财政部门、国营油脂公司及合作社选派干部组成，设站地点以能便利农民缴纳及货物运输为主要条件。凡离站较远而超过规定义务运送里程的，超过部分由国家发给运费。
    在征实品种上，以征收花生仁为主，无搓仁习惯地区可以缴纳花生果。为贯彻公平合理原则及计算便利，花生仁分成甲、乙级和毛货三等，按级作价。花生果按照出仁多少和仁的等级折算。一律以当地公司收购牌价为标准计算。
    各地征收站决定在党、政领导下邀请农民代表会同组织评议小组，协助检查质量等级，对评等、作价、过磅等事进行监督，此外，对可能发生的人畜伤亡、车船损坏等事故作出了必要的防范和处理的具体办法。（张秉谦）
