Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 11th: Explanation work did not proceed on the 11th, marking the fourth consecutive day of interruption since the 6th. The US side is clearly directing special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp to intensify sabotage of the explanation work, attempting to completely deprive prisoners of war of their right to hear explanations and request repatriation. It is by no means accidental that, just as the explanation work is being subjected to intolerable obstruction, the US propaganda machine is gleefully proclaiming that the explanation work is about to be "written off."

The Korean-Chinese side has made every effort to ensure that the explanation work is no longer delayed. To accommodate the difficulties of the Indian custodial forces, the Korean-Chinese side has agreed to proceed with explanations to prisoners of war in another camp only after explanations to all prisoners of war in one camp have been completed. Moreover, since the 7th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been notified that explanations will be given to all prisoners of war in Camp 22, rather than, as fabricated by the American news agencies, insisting that the Indian army alone bring prisoners of war who have not heard explanations in this camp to the explanation site.

The US side is now threatening to limit the time for explanations to each individual prisoner of war and to complete explanations to all prisoners of war in one camp each day. The US side is also directing special agents in the camp to threaten the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, stating that if this is not done, the explanation work will be stopped. In reality, this demand by the US side is merely another trick to cover up its sabotage of the explanation work in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

According to the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Procedures," the time for explanations to each prisoner of war is determined by the explanation representative of the prisoner's country. If the explanation work for all prisoners of war in one camp must be completed every day, and if each camp has 500 people and the time for explanation is calculated as a full eight hours each day (in fact, there has not been a single day in the past when explanations actually lasted eight hours), then the time for each prisoner of war to listen to explanations is only thirty minutes. Moreover, this thirty minutes is also offset by the various disturbances and intimidation orchestrated by the US side.

The reason why the US side wants to limit the explanation time can be found in the experiences of returning personnel. According to returning personnel who were captured by the enemy, they had to listen to fifteen hours of counter-explanation "education" and intimidation every day in the POW camps in the Demilitarized Zone. This caused them to become mentally exhausted, so when they entered the explanation tent, their minds were muddled and they could not hear any explanation at all. It took about an hour for them to gradually clear their heads and consider the issues. Volunteer Army prisoner of war Yue Heidan is a prominent example. At first, he dared not apply for repatriation. Only after nearly three hours of explanation did he dare to request repatriation. Without these three hours of explanation time, Yue Heidan would not have been able to go home.

From the date of the start of explanations stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," only less than forty hours, or less than five days, of explanation time has actually been conducted. In such a short period of time, the explanation work has been carried out under extreme disruption by US special agents, and has been constantly interrupted by the US personnel's violations of the "Working Procedures" and the actions of Swiss and Swedish personnel. The time of these interruptions has exceeded the actual time spent on explanations in many explanation tents. For example, on November 4, the Swedish personnel in Explanation Tent No. 20 interrupted the meeting seven times while our side was explaining to the same prisoner of war. The last interruption lasted more than forty minutes. The prisoner of war stayed in the tent for two hours, but the total time he actually listened to the explanation was only forty minutes. The Swiss and Swedish representatives in several tents have interrupted explanations by walking out of the tent.

### 十一日解释工作因特务捣乱又未能进行

    十一日解释工作因特务捣乱又未能进行
    【新华社开城十一日电】十一日解释工作仍然没有进行，这已是六日以来解释工作连续停顿的第四天。美方显然正指使东场里战俘营中的特务加紧破坏解释工作，企图借此完全剥夺战俘听解释和要求返回祖国的权利。决非偶然的是：正当解释工作遭到不能容忍的阻挠的同时，美方宣传机器兴高采烈地叫嚷解释工作就要“一笔勾销”。
    朝中方面已经作了一切努力，使解释工作不再被拖延下去。为照顾印度看管部队的困难，朝中方面已经同意在向一个营场的全部战俘解释完毕之后再向另一个营场的战俘进行解释，而且自七日以来就通知中立国遣返委员会要向第二十二号营场全体战俘进行解释，而不是如美国通讯社所捏造的，坚持要印度军队单独把这个营场中没有听过解释的战俘带到解释场所。
    美方现在正威胁着必须限制对每一个别战俘解释的时间，并必须每天解释完一个营场的全部战俘，美方并指使营场中的特务威胁中立国遣返委员会：如果不是这样，解释工作就将停顿。实际上美方的这种要求只是为了掩饰它破坏解释工作、以便强迫扣留战俘的另一种花样而已。
    根据“职权范围”和“工作细则”的规定，对每一战俘进行解释的时间是由战俘所属国家的解释代表决定的。如果每天必须完成对一个营场的全部战俘的解释工作，按每一营场五百人而每天进行解释的时间是足足八小时计算（事实上过去没有一天真正解释了八小时），每一战俘听取解释的时间仅有三十分钟，而且这三十分钟的时间也被美方所布置的各种扰乱和恐吓所抵消。
    美方要限制解释时间的原因，从归来人员的经验中可以找到说明。据归来的我方被俘人员说明，仅仅在非军事区战俘营中，他们每天就必须听取十五个小时的反解释“教育”和恐吓，把他们摧残得精神十分紧张，所以在进入解释帐篷时，头脑都昏昏沉沉，根本听不见任何解释，必须约一个小时之后，才能逐渐清醒过来，考虑问题。志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦就是显著的例证，他在开始时不敢申请遣返，经过近三个小时的解释，他才敢要求遣返。没有这三小时的解释时间，岳黑旦就不可能回家。
    从“职权范围”规定的解释开始之日起，实际上只进行了不足四十个小时，就是还不到五天的解释时间。在这样短短的时间中，解释工作是在美方特务极度的扰乱之下进行的，而在进行中又不断为美方人员违反“工作细则”的行为及瑞士、瑞典人员所中断，这种中断的时间，在许多解释帐篷里都超过了实际进行解释的时间，例如：十一月四日第二十号解释帐篷的瑞典人员在我方向同一名战俘进行解释时，曾中断会议七次，其中最后一次中断时间长达四十多分钟，这个战俘在帐篷里呆了两个小时，但实际听取解释的时间全部加起来仅仅只有四十分钟。有好几个帐篷的瑞士和瑞典代表都曾以退出帐篷的行动来中断解释。
