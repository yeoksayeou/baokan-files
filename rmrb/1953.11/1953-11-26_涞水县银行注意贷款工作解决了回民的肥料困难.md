    Laishui County Bank Pays Attention to Loan Work, Solving Fertilizer Difficulties for the Hui People
    Wang Peng from the Laishui County Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Bank writes: There are 423 households in Nanguan Village, Laishui County, a quarter of whom are Hui people. In the past, the bank's issuance of various agricultural production loans did not adequately take care of the Hui people.

    This year, the bank provided 9.64 million yuan in loans to Nanguan Village, with Hui people receiving 36.6 percent of the loans. In order to understand the situation of loans to ethnic minorities and their demands, the bank convened a forum with Hui borrowers and imams. Hui resident Ma Lin said: "In the past, the crops of the Hui people and the Han people were of two different colors. The crops of the Han people were 'pitch black,' while the crops of the Hui people were 'charred yellow,' mainly because we Hui people lacked fertilizer. This year, thanks to the care of the People's Government for our ethnic minorities, helping to solve the problem of accumulating fertilizer, and providing loans to help buy fertilizer, our crops have become the same color as those of the Han people." Liu Huifeng said: "This year, I borrowed 250,000 yuan from the bank for topdressing fertilizer and immediately bought 450 jin of cottonseed cake from the supply and marketing cooperative. I applied it once to my nine mu of land, yielding two shi per mu. Otherwise, my land would have barely exceeded one shi."

    Finally, bank cadres asked them what their main demands were for the future. They said in unison: "The main difficulty for us Hui people in production is the lack of fertilizer. We hope that you will continue to help us solve the difficulty of lacking fertilizer in the future." I believe that this request from the Hui people deserves attention and resolution in places with similar situations.

### 涞水县银行注意贷款工作解决了回民的肥料困难

    涞水县银行注意贷款工作解决了回民的肥料困难
    河北省人民银行分行涞水县支行王鹏来信：涞水县南关村共四百二十三户，回族占四分之一。往年银行发放各项农业生产贷款，对回民照顾的很不够。
    今年银行给南关村贷款九百六十四万元，回民享受贷款的占到总数的百分之三十六点六。银行为了了解对少数民族贷款的情况和他们的要求，曾召集了回民贷款户、教长等人开了座谈会，回民马林说：“过去回民和汉民的庄稼是两色。汉民的庄稼是‘漆油儿黑’，回民的庄稼是‘焦油儿黄’，主要是我们回民缺乏肥料，今年由于人民政府对我们少数民族的照顾，帮助解决积肥办法，贷款帮助买肥料，我们的庄稼和汉民的庄稼变成一色了。”刘会峰说：“今年我从银行贷了二十五万元的追肥款，立刻就到供销社买了四百五十斤棉仁饼，把九亩地施了一次追肥，每亩整产了两石，要不我那地顶多也超不过一石去。”
    最后，银行干部征求他们今后的主要要求是什么？他们异口同声地说：“我们回民在生产上主要的困难就是缺乏肥料，希望今后继续帮助我们解决缺肥的困难。”我认为回民的这个要求，值得有类似情况的地方注意解决。
