Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: TASS released the following statement refuting rumors:

    AFP, based on rumors from the British side, released a message insisting that someone had made a suggestion to G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, proposing that he attend a meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—and insisting that G.M. Malenkov had notified the British government through V.M. Molotov, expressing his readiness to agree to convene such a meeting.

    TASS is authorized to declare: The above message is completely inconsistent with the facts, and its purpose is obviously to divert people's attention from the aims pursued by the planned one-sided meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France in Bermuda.

    塔斯社发表声明
    驳斥法新社根据谣言散布的消息
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：塔斯社发表辟谣声明如下：
    法新社根据英国方面的谣传，发布了一个消息，硬说已有人向苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫提出了一项建议，建议他参加四大国——苏联、美国、英国、法国——政府首长会议，并硬说格·马·马林科夫已通过维·米·莫洛托夫通知英国政府，表示他准备同意召开这样的会议。
    塔斯社受权声明：上述消息是一点也不符合事实的，其目的显然是要转移人们对于计划中的美、英、法三国政府首脑在百慕大片面举行会议所追求的目的的注意。
