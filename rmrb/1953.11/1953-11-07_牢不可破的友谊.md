    Unbreakable Friendship
    Soviet Writer Ni. Tikhonov

    We know that the great Chinese people are joining the Soviet people in warmly celebrating November 7th, the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and celebrating this joyous festival of the victory of the proletarian revolution.

    We know that when China was still engaged in a fierce struggle for the people's freedom and independence, the Chinese people celebrated the Great October Revolution Day. In the liberated areas, where people were preparing for a desperate fight, and surrounded by the dark forces of imperialism and their henchmen, the Communist Party members and all progressive people of fighting China celebrated the great achievements of the Soviet people and rejoiced in the achievements of the Soviet people in building a strong Soviet state.

    On this great national holiday, we cannot help but embrace our cherished friends. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, they are so enthusiastically building a strong industrial power with the heroism of labor - a new, free, and people's China.

    Imperialists are only accustomed to seeing the size of the area when looking at the area of colonies, and when looking at the achievements, they only look at the situation of personal enrichment, and how much gold flows into their safes; for them, the friendship between our two great nations and the close cooperation in politics, economy, technology, science, and art is an incomprehensible, illusory, and threatening to their bloated happiness. They are still fantasizing about some accident happening that will restore to them the previous prestige that was taken from their hands, so that millions of hungry people will beg them for small pieces of bread, and that machine guns and bombs can protect the mansions of the concessions and the wharves of the ports, and then be able to load the looted Chinese wealth into the cabins. They are unwilling to believe that this will never happen again.

    Let them look at a photo of a worker in this new China: this worker stands proudly, full of confidence in his future, with his head held high, the master of his own factory and his own country, carefully and skillfully observing how the crane is lifting the machine parts. His eyes are full of love for his own cause, his own factory, and his own motherland.

    Let them, the imperialists, take another look at another photo - how the women of the "Spark" collective farm in Northeast China are discussing the completion of the spring work plan. A young woman is standing on a cart with a piece of paper in her hand, on which the work plan is written. Her right hand is stretched forward, as if indicating the rhythm of her words. Sitting and standing in front of her are some women who suffered yesterday - female farmers. And today their past life is unrecognizable. On their joyful faces, there is no longer fear of tomorrow. They are all very serious because they understand their great responsibilities. They are filled with joy because they have confidence in their own strength, and at the same time, they feel how their position has improved in these years: the land has been transferred to their hands, and these lands are what their fathers and grandfathers talked about with trembling and tears.

    These new masters of factories and land in free China are creators of new and unprecedented life. The worker-peasant alliance is a great force in the struggle for a new life and the foundation on which the state where laborers and the people hold power relies for its strength.

    In our Soviet country, under the leadership of the heroic Soviet Communist Party, we have built large industries and transformed agriculture on a socialist basis. Now we must vigorously increase the production of people's consumer goods and various agricultural sectors to raise the material welfare of the residents to a higher level.

    We Soviets understand the following words of Comrade Mao Zedong. He said: "We are going to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. ...We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union."

    The friendship between our two peoples is great and of historical significance and unparalleled in world history; the assistance given by the Soviets to the new China contains nothing other than unbreakable close friendship and the most sincere cooperation.

    Our two peoples have eliminated their oppressors. The enthusiasm of the masses of the people has turned to the great transformation cause. The strength of our two peoples is inexhaustible, and our territory is very vast. Our comradely friendship was not created yesterday. Nor was it created in the quiet offices of politicians, but in the hearts of warriors fighting for the cause of the people. It was created in the struggle for freedom. Our friendship has undergone the most severe tests and has been tempered by the flames of war. There are some similarities in the character of our two peoples, that is: talented, good at overcoming all difficulties, not afraid of hardship, persistent in achieving success, the courage and boldness of revolutionary transformation, and a broad vision. Our two peoples have shown many examples in this regard, which have all been recorded in the history of the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Soviet Union and China.

    Rich spiritual life and free thought, love of the motherland, and long-term struggle with the enslavers of the people made the Soviets and the sons of the people's China close in the past as well. Therefore, the further consolidation of our friendship is manifested in living practice, in facts, and in examples, not only in verbal goodwill.

    In the various sectors of creative labor and culture, we will try our best to consolidate and expand our ties. Soviet engineers, technicians, and advanced workers in various production fields will advance hand in hand with Chinese comrades, and help in every aspect that a friend can contribute.

    Soviets love labor and can work. The Soviets see in the Chinese friends such loyal successors to the advanced ideas of our time, and skilled workers engaged in work with a true spirit of patriotism. The Soviets and Chinese friends are so close that their common enthusiasm has created miracles: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which is five hundred and five kilometers long, was completed in two years; a female textile worker who manages a machine tool, who used to stand next to the machine tool and only get a little money that kept her from starving, now works on eighty machine tools and completes an average of one hundred and thirty-five percent of the task!

    We have seen the joyful labor of the people everywhere in China - in factories, fields, and farms, they work for a better future and to consolidate the power of the motherland.

    Soviet scientists came to China, and Moscow also received scientists from the people's China. These mutual visits and meetings contain great possibilities. People's China has many scientists who work for the happiness of the people and the happiness of the world. Mutual respect and exchange of experience is a great thing, which can benefit the science of both countries.

    Scientists from our two countries study various scientific issues and help each other - whether it involves technical issues, biology, chemistry, or other issues.

    So, are we not very interested in history? Soviet scholars have paid more attention to Chinese historical issues. Broad popular movements, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, are well known to every educated person in the Soviet Union, and similarly, Chinese friends know the history of our people's struggle in great detail.

    And musicians and actors! Their creations have the broadest impact on human society. The unique music inherited by the people's China from its ancestors and the modern music of China often meet with Soviet music. In the programs of Soviet concerts, the unique Chinese musical melodies are often heard and warmly welcomed by the Soviets. Similarly, our music also enjoys great prestige in China.

    Our people are very interested in Chinese works of art. How many Soviet painting and woodcut masters, how many art lovers and critics, workers and collective farmers have visited the exhibitions in Moscow that display exemplary Chinese art works, both old and new. We are interested in the recent beautiful prints depicting labor heroes in industry and agriculture, and we also love the unparalleled grotto murals. These grottoes were built in the fourth century or later in Gansu Province in western China.

    Our artists also show our Chinese friends outstanding classical works and rare examples of Soviet paintings and folk creations, which are no less inferior than the murals of ancient Italian masters.

    We translate more and more works of our friends into Russian. In addition to many famous authors, we also collect the works of young authors, the purpose of which is to enable Soviet readers to be aware of the literary achievements of fraternal China in a timely manner.

    In the field of culture, our ties are full of spiritual communication and friendship. For the semi-colonial or simply colonial Asian peoples, for the people who are struggling for a better future, and for all freedom-loving people, the example of our friendship will be an inspiring example.

    The unity of our common ranks is conducive to the cause of peace. Our economic cooperation shatters all the false fabrications of foreign lobbyists in front of the people.

    Under the banner of further consolidating the friendship, unity, and economic cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, we are advancing along the road of consolidating and establishing peace. We know that our alliance has great significance for all countries and the people of the world. The camp defending peace is not a camp where a certain army bivouacs during a march. Absolutely not, the people in this great camp are all over the world, they are countless, because new forces are constantly increasing among them.

    No matter how hard the aggressors try to ignite the flames of a new war in the Far East, they will never succeed. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are unbreakable fortresses of peace, and along with them, all progressive mankind defends peace.

    The Soviets pay fraternal tribute to the great Chinese people and hold their hands of friendship tightly. We believe that the Soviet and Chinese people, loyal to the policy of peace, have formed a force unprecedented in human history.

    Nothing can stop us from moving forward. We will continue to move forward together, towards higher and higher directions, and at the same time, our sharp eyes will not relax on those who threaten the peace of the world and the safety of the people. We will surely win in the struggle for communism. Our great friendship is the guarantee. We will continue to help each other in the future, just like dear brothers, just like loyal comrades.
