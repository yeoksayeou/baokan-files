    Unbreakable Friendship
    Soviet Writer Ni. Tikhonov

    We know that the great Chinese people are joining the Soviet people in warmly celebrating November 7th, the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and celebrating this joyous festival of the victory of the proletarian revolution.

    We know that when China was still engaged in a fierce struggle for the people's freedom and independence, the Chinese people celebrated the Great October Revolution Day. In the liberated areas, where people were preparing for a desperate fight, and surrounded by the dark forces of imperialism and their henchmen, the Communist Party members and all progressive people of fighting China celebrated the great achievements of the Soviet people and rejoiced in the achievements of the Soviet people in building a strong Soviet state.

    On this great national holiday, we cannot help but embrace our cherished friends. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, they are so enthusiastically building a strong industrial power with the heroism of labor - a new, free, and people's China.

    Imperialists are only accustomed to seeing the size of the area when looking at the area of colonies, and when looking at the achievements, they only look at the situation of personal enrichment, and how much gold flows into their safes; for them, the friendship between our two great nations and the close cooperation in politics, economy, technology, science, and art is an incomprehensible, illusory, and threatening to their bloated happiness. They are still fantasizing about some accident happening that will restore to them the previous prestige that was taken from their hands, so that millions of hungry people will beg them for small pieces of bread, and that machine guns and bombs can protect the mansions of the concessions and the wharves of the ports, and then be able to load the looted Chinese wealth into the cabins. They are unwilling to believe that this will never happen again.

    Let them look at a photo of a worker in this new China: this worker stands proudly, full of confidence in his future, with his head held high, the master of his own factory and his own country, carefully and skillfully observing how the crane is lifting the machine parts. His eyes are full of love for his own cause, his own factory, and his own motherland.

    Let them, the imperialists, take another look at another photo - how the women of the "Spark" collective farm in Northeast China are discussing the completion of the spring work plan. A young woman is standing on a cart with a piece of paper in her hand, on which the work plan is written. Her right hand is stretched forward, as if indicating the rhythm of her words. Sitting and standing in front of her are some women who suffered yesterday - female farmers. And today their past life is unrecognizable. On their joyful faces, there is no longer fear of tomorrow. They are all very serious because they understand their great responsibilities. They are filled with joy because they have confidence in their own strength, and at the same time, they feel how their position has improved in these years: the land has been transferred to their hands, and these lands are what their fathers and grandfathers talked about with trembling and tears.

    These new masters of factories and land in free China are creators of new and unprecedented life. The worker-peasant alliance is a great force in the struggle for a new life and the foundation on which the state where laborers and the people hold power relies for its strength.

    In our Soviet country, under the leadership of the heroic Soviet Communist Party, we have built large industries and transformed agriculture on a socialist basis. Now we must vigorously increase the production of people's consumer goods and various agricultural sectors to raise the material welfare of the residents to a higher level.

    We Soviets understand the following words of Comrade Mao Zedong. He said: "We are going to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. ...We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union."

    The friendship between our two peoples is great and of historical significance and unparalleled in world history; the assistance given by the Soviets to the new China contains nothing other than unbreakable close friendship and the most sincere cooperation.

    Our two peoples have eliminated their oppressors. The enthusiasm of the masses of the people has turned to the great transformation cause. The strength of our two peoples is inexhaustible, and our territory is very vast. Our comradely friendship was not created yesterday. Nor was it created in the quiet offices of politicians, but in the hearts of warriors fighting for the cause of the people. It was created in the struggle for freedom. Our friendship has undergone the most severe tests and has been tempered by the flames of war. There are some similarities in the character of our two peoples, that is: talented, good at overcoming all difficulties, not afraid of hardship, persistent in achieving success, the courage and boldness of revolutionary transformation, and a broad vision. Our two peoples have shown many examples in this regard, which have all been recorded in the history of the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Soviet Union and China.

    Rich spiritual life and free thought, love of the motherland, and long-term struggle with the enslavers of the people made the Soviets and the sons of the people's China close in the past as well. Therefore, the further consolidation of our friendship is manifested in living practice, in facts, and in examples, not only in verbal goodwill.

    In the various sectors of creative labor and culture, we will try our best to consolidate and expand our ties. Soviet engineers, technicians, and advanced workers in various production fields will advance hand in hand with Chinese comrades, and help in every aspect that a friend can contribute.

    Soviets love labor and can work. The Soviets see in the Chinese friends such loyal successors to the advanced ideas of our time, and skilled workers engaged in work with a true spirit of patriotism. The Soviets and Chinese friends are so close that their common enthusiasm has created miracles: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which is five hundred and five kilometers long, was completed in two years; a female textile worker who manages a machine tool, who used to stand next to the machine tool and only get a little money that kept her from starving, now works on eighty machine tools and completes an average of one hundred and thirty-five percent of the task!

    We have seen the joyful labor of the people everywhere in China - in factories, fields, and farms, they work for a better future and to consolidate the power of the motherland.

    Soviet scientists came to China, and Moscow also received scientists from the people's China. These mutual visits and meetings contain great possibilities. People's China has many scientists who work for the happiness of the people and the happiness of the world. Mutual respect and exchange of experience is a great thing, which can benefit the science of both countries.

    Scientists from our two countries study various scientific issues and help each other - whether it involves technical issues, biology, chemistry, or other issues.

    So, are we not very interested in history? Soviet scholars have paid more attention to Chinese historical issues. Broad popular movements, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, are well known to every educated person in the Soviet Union, and similarly, Chinese friends know the history of our people's struggle in great detail.

    And musicians and actors! Their creations have the broadest impact on human society. The unique music inherited by the people's China from its ancestors and the modern music of China often meet with Soviet music. In the programs of Soviet concerts, the unique Chinese musical melodies are often heard and warmly welcomed by the Soviets. Similarly, our music also enjoys great prestige in China.

    Our people are very interested in Chinese works of art. How many Soviet painting and woodcut masters, how many art lovers and critics, workers and collective farmers have visited the exhibitions in Moscow that display exemplary Chinese art works, both old and new. We are interested in the recent beautiful prints depicting labor heroes in industry and agriculture, and we also love the unparalleled grotto murals. These grottoes were built in the fourth century or later in Gansu Province in western China.

    Our artists also show our Chinese friends outstanding classical works and rare examples of Soviet paintings and folk creations, which are no less inferior than the murals of ancient Italian masters.

    We translate more and more works of our friends into Russian. In addition to many famous authors, we also collect the works of young authors, the purpose of which is to enable Soviet readers to be aware of the literary achievements of fraternal China in a timely manner.

    In the field of culture, our ties are full of spiritual communication and friendship. For the semi-colonial or simply colonial Asian peoples, for the people who are struggling for a better future, and for all freedom-loving people, the example of our friendship will be an inspiring example.

    The unity of our common ranks is conducive to the cause of peace. Our economic cooperation shatters all the false fabrications of foreign lobbyists in front of the people.

    Under the banner of further consolidating the friendship, unity, and economic cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, we are advancing along the road of consolidating and establishing peace. We know that our alliance has great significance for all countries and the people of the world. The camp defending peace is not a camp where a certain army bivouacs during a march. Absolutely not, the people in this great camp are all over the world, they are countless, because new forces are constantly increasing among them.

    No matter how hard the aggressors try to ignite the flames of a new war in the Far East, they will never succeed. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are unbreakable fortresses of peace, and along with them, all progressive mankind defends peace.

    The Soviets pay fraternal tribute to the great Chinese people and hold their hands of friendship tightly. We believe that the Soviet and Chinese people, loyal to the policy of peace, have formed a force unprecedented in human history.

    Nothing can stop us from moving forward. We will continue to move forward together, towards higher and higher directions, and at the same time, our sharp eyes will not relax on those who threaten the peace of the world and the safety of the people. We will surely win in the struggle for communism. Our great friendship is the guarantee. We will continue to help each other in the future, just like dear brothers, just like loyal comrades.

    牢不可破的友谊
    苏联作家　尼·吉洪诺夫
    我们知道，伟大的中国人民是和苏联人民一道来热烈地庆祝十一月七日，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十六周年，庆祝这个无产阶级革命胜利的欢乐节日的。
    我们知道，当中国还在进行着争取人民的自由和独立的残酷斗争时，中国人民就曾庆祝伟大的十月革命节。在人们准备着决死战斗的解放区，在这为帝国主义的黑暗势力及其佣仆所包围的地方，共产党员和战斗的中国的全体进步人士，都曾庆祝苏联人民的伟大成就，并为苏联人民在建设强大的苏维埃国家事业中所获得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    在这伟大的全民节日，我们不禁要拥抱我们所珍爱的朋友们。他们在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下正在这样热情地以劳动的英雄主义精神来建设强大的工业强国——新的、自由的、人民的中国。
    帝国主义者们只是在看殖民地的面积时才惯于看到范围的大小，至于看成绩如何时，则只是看个人致富的情况，看流到他们保险柜中的黄金的多寡；对于他们来说，我们两大民族的友谊和在政治、经济、技术、科学、艺术各方面的紧密合作的这种新现象，是不能理解的、虚幻的，是威胁着他们那脑满肠肥的幸福的。他们还在幻想着发生一件什么意外的事，把从他们手中夺走的先前的威风还给他们，使千百万饥饿的人向他们求乞小块面包，使机关枪和炸弹能保卫租界的宅邸和港口的码头，再能够从这里把掠夺来的中国财富装到船舱中去。他们不愿意相信，这种事是决不会再发生的了。
    让他们看看这么一张新中国一个工人的照片吧：这个工人自豪地站着，对自己的前途满怀信心，高仰着头，这个自己工厂和自己国家的主人，注意地、熟练地观察着起重机怎样举起着机器零件。他的眼光中充满着对他自己的事业、自己的工厂和自己的祖国的热爱。
    让他们，帝国主义者们再看看另外一张照片——中国东北的“星火”集体农庄的妇女怎样在讨论完成春季工作计划问题。一个年青妇女拿着一张纸站在大车上，纸上写的是工作计划。她的右手向前伸着，好像是在表明她的话的节奏。她面前坐着和站着一些昨天还受着苦难的妇女——女农民们。而今天她们的过去的生活已不可辨认。在她们那欢愉的脸庞上已看不到对明天的恐惧。她们都是很严肃的，因为她们理解自己的重大责任。她们充满了愉快，因为她们有对自己的力量的信心，同时她们感到在这几年中她们的地位是怎样提高了：土地已转移到她们手中，而这些土地是她们的父亲和祖父战栗着和含着泪谈到的。
    自由中国的工厂和土地的这些新主人，是新的空前的生活的创造者。工农联盟是争取新生活斗争中的伟大力量，是劳动者、人民掌握政权的国家赖以强盛的基础。
    我们在自己的苏维埃国家中，在英雄的苏联共产党领导下建立了大工业，在社会主义基础上改造了农业，现在我们要大力提高人民消费品和农业各部门的生产，以便使居民的物质福利达到更高的水平。
    毛泽东同志所说的以下这几句话，我们苏联人是理解的。他说：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。……我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。”
    我们两国人民的友谊是伟大的具有历史意义的，在世界历史上是无与伦比的；苏联人给予新中国的援助，除去牢不可破的亲密友谊和最真诚的合作之外，没有包含任何其他东西。
    我们两国人民消灭了自己的压迫者。人民群众的热情转向伟大的改造事业。我们两国人民的力量是用之不竭的，我们的国土是非常辽阔的。我们的同志般的友爱并不是昨天才产生的。也不是在政客的静寂的办公室中产生的，而是在为人民的事业而斗争的战士心灵中产生的。是在争取自由的斗争中产生的。我们的友谊曾经历过最艰苦的考验，并且受过战火的锻炼。在我们两国人民的性格中有一些相似的地方，这就是：富有才干，善于克服一切困难，不怕艰苦，坚持达到成功，革命改造的勇敢和气魄，眼光远大。我们两国人民在这方面表现出了许多典范，这已都载入争取苏联和中国的自由与独立的斗争史册中。
    丰富的精神生活和自由的思想，爱祖国，长期和人民奴役者斗争，使苏联人和人民中国的儿子们过去也是亲密的。因此，我们的友谊的进一步巩固是表现在活生生的实际中，表现在事实上，表现在实例上，而不是只表现在口头的善意上。
    在创造性劳动和文化的各部门，我们将更尽力巩固和扩大我们的联系。苏联的工程师、技术、各生产方面的先进工作者将和中国同志手携手地前进，在一个朋友能出力的一切方面给以帮助。
    苏联人喜爱劳动而且会劳动。苏联人在中国朋友的身上看到我们时代的先进思想的这样忠诚的继承者，看到以真正的爱国主义精神从事工作的能手。苏联人和中国朋友是这样地亲近，他们的共同热情就产生了奇迹：两年中建成了长达五百○五公里的成渝铁路；管理一架机床的女纺织工，从前站在机床旁边只能得到使她不致饿死的一点钱，现在她在八十架机床上工作，而且平均完成任务的百分之一百三十五！
    我们无论在中国的任何地方——工厂、田野和农场，到处都看到了人民的愉快的劳动，他们为了美好的未来，为了巩固祖国的威力而工作。
    苏联科学家来到中国，而莫斯科也接待人民中国的科学家。这些相互的访问和会见之中，蕴藏着巨大的可能性。人民中国有许多为人民的幸福、为世界的幸福而工作的科学家。互相尊重和交换经验是一件极好的事情，它可以给两国的科学带来裨益。
    我们两国的科学家研究着各种不同的科学问题，并且互相帮助——无论是涉及到技术问题，生物学、化学或其他问题都是如此。
    这么说，难道在历史学方面，我们就兴趣不大吗？苏联学者已更加注意中国的历史问题。广大的人民运动，如太平天国，在苏联已是每一个有文化的人所熟知的事，同样，中国朋友对我国人民斗争的历史也是知道得很详细的。
    还有音乐家和演员们！他们的创作是对人类社会具有最广泛的影响的。人民中国由远祖继承下来的独具风格的音乐和中国的现代音乐都时常和苏联音乐会见。在苏联音乐会的节目中，已时常听到中国那独具风格的音乐曲调，并受到苏联人的热烈欢迎，同样，我国的音乐在中国也享有很大的声誉。
    我国人民对中国的美术作品很感兴趣。有多少苏联绘画和木刻的能手，有多少艺术的爱好者和批评家、工人和集体农民都参观了莫斯科陈列有中国新旧艺术作品典范的展览会。我们对最近的描写工业和农业方面的劳动英雄的美丽版画感到兴趣，同时我们也喜爱那无可比拟的石窟壁画。这些石窟是在四世纪或稍后建筑在中国西部的甘肃省的。
    我们的艺术家们也把卓越的古典作品和苏联绘画以及人民创作的罕有的典范给中国朋友们看，这些人民创作较之古代意大利能手们的壁画并无逊色。
    我们把自己朋友们的越来越多的作品翻译成俄文。除了许多著名的作者外，我们也搜集了青年作者的作品，其目的为的是使苏联读者能及时认识到兄弟般的中国的文学成就。
    在文化的领域中，我们彼此间的联系充满了精神上的交往和友谊。对于半殖民地的或者说简直是殖民地的亚洲人民来说，对于为了美好的将来而斗争的人们来说，对于全体爱好自由的人民来说，我们的友谊的实例将是一个鼓舞的范例。
    我们共同的队伍的团结是有利于和平事业的。我们的经济合作在人民面前粉碎了外国游说家们的一切虚伪捏造。
    在进一步巩固中苏两国人民的友谊、团结和经济合作的旗帜下，我们沿着巩固和确立和平的道路前进，我们知道，我们的联盟对于各国和全世界人民来说具有重大的意义。保卫和平的阵营，并不是某一军队在行军时露宿的阵营。绝不是的，这个伟大阵营的人们遍布各地，他们是不可胜数的，因为他们中间不断地增加着新的力量。
    无论侵略者怎样想尽一切办法在远东煽起新战争的火焰，他们决不会成功的。苏联和中华人民共和国是牢不可破的和平堡垒，而和他们一道保卫和平的还有全体进步人类。
    苏联人向伟大的中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼并紧握着他们的友谊的双手，我们相信忠实于和平政策的苏联和中国人民已组成为一支人类历史上从未有过的力量。
    没有任何东西能阻止我们前进。我们将共同继续前进，向着更远更高的方向前进，同时我们的锐利的目光也不放松那些威胁着世界安宁与人民的安全的人。我们在争取共产主义的斗争中一定会战胜。我们伟大的友谊就是保证。我们今后也要互相帮助，就像亲爱的兄弟一样，就像忠实的战友一样。
