East China is holding spare-time schools and correspondence courses for primary and secondary school teachers.
The vast number of primary and secondary school teachers in East China are actively participating in spare-time study. Cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, and Hangzhou have established teachers' spare-time schools, with each school having more than a thousand students. Many normal schools have also established correspondence courses for the vast number of rural primary school teachers. More than 8,000 rural primary school teachers across the region are participating in correspondence learning. In addition, in some areas where conditions permit, teacher study communication networks, subject teaching research associations, and mobile libraries have been set up to assist teachers in their political, cultural, and professional studies.
Most of the teachers' spare-time learning organizations in various regions are established according to the different levels of teachers. Among them, teachers' spare-time schools have become a more regular and systematic organizational form for improving teachers' professional level and teaching quality. The Nanjing Middle School Teachers' Refresher College has opened specialized training classes and research classes. The specialized training classes adopt the method of specialized training by subject, requiring about three years to basically raise the level of existing middle school teachers with high school and secondary normal school levels to the level of graduates of normal colleges; the research classes focus on studying the main course content and teaching methods of middle schools, with one semester as a stage. The Chinese language class of Nanjing Primary School Teachers' Refresher School started with grammar, punctuation marks, phonetic symbols, and misspelled words, so that students understood how to correct pupils' misspelled words and incomprehensible sentences.
Correspondence schools, mainly targeting rural primary school teachers, have also played a certain role in improving the cultural knowledge of rural primary school teachers and helping them overcome teaching difficulties. The students of correspondence schools in various regions are mostly rural primary school teachers who are equivalent to junior normal school and junior high school dropouts, or primary school graduates. They are generally required to reach the level of junior normal school graduates after about three years of study. Since most students lack basic knowledge and have poor self-study ability, many correspondence schools also combine correspondence with face-to-face instruction.

    华东举办中小学教师业余进修学校和函授班
    华东区广大的中小学教师积极参加业余进修学习。济南、青岛、南京、杭州等城市都已设立了教师业余进修学校，每校学员多在一千人左右。许多师范学校还为广大的农村小学教师设立了函授班。全区参加函授学习的农村小学教师已有八千多人。此外，在一些有条件的地区，并举办了教师学习通讯网，各科教学研究会和流动图书馆等，来辅助教师们的政治、文化、业务学习。
    各地的教师业余进修组织大部是按照教师的不同水平设立的。其中教师业余进修学校已成为较正规的有系统的提高教师业务水平和教学质量的组织形式。南京市中学教师进修学院开设了专修班和研究班，专修班采取分科进修的办法，要求以三年左右的时间，将现有高中、中等师范水平的中学师资，基本上提高到师范专科学校毕业的水平；研究班以研究中学的主要课程内容和教学方法为主，以一学期为一阶段。南京市小学教师进修学校语文班从语法、标点符号、注音符号、错别字讲起，使学员懂得了如何去改正小学生的错别字和不通的文句。
    以农村小学教师为主要对象的函授学校，在提高农村小学教师的文化知识和帮助他们克服教学困难方面，也发挥了一定的作用。各地的函授学校的学员大都是相当于初级师范和初级中学肄业，或是小学毕业水平的农村小学教师，一般要求经过三年左右时间的学习，达到初级师范毕业的水平。由于大部分学员缺乏基础知识，自学能力较差，许多函授学校在进行函授时还结合了面授。
