Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: TASS reports that on November 7th, across the vast territory of the Soviet Union, millions of working people enthusiastically celebrated the 36th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. Laboring people everywhere held grand festive parades, demonstrating their unbreakable unity around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, expressing their fervent desire to consolidate the achievements of the socialist revolution, resolutely safeguard the cause of peace, and tirelessly strive to realize the Communist Party's great program of further improving the people's living standards.

	As the Soviet Far East celebrations began, it was still night in Moscow. The golden morning sun awakened the residents of Vladivostok. By this time, Vladivostok had donned its festive attire, with red flags and banners everywhere. The ships in the harbor were even more beautifully decorated. Sailors, fishermen, miners, lumberjacks, scientists, and students joyfully participated in the festive parade. In Yakutsk in the north, the aurora borealis shimmered in the cold, clear night. Thousands of workers held a grand demonstration. This residential area, which had only a few handicraft factories in the early days of the revolution, has developed into a large central city.

	In Central Asia, the people of the Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, and Kyrgyz republics celebrated the festival with the spirit of further strengthening the friendship of all nationalities. In Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, bright red banners were hung on the wide streets, with slogans such as "Long live the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people!" written in Kazakh and Russian. Hundreds of thousands of Uzbeks marched in formation in Red Square in Tashkent, the capital of the republic. The marchers held aloft portraits of leaders, huge banners, and charts reporting production achievements. Twenty-five enterprises in Tashkent completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule. Workers in dozens of factories have increased the production of daily necessities, machines, and agricultural implements.

	In the Transcaucasus, the people of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia joyfully celebrated their festival. Baku, Tbilisi, and Yerevan all held festive parades lasting for several hours. In Kishinev, the capital of Moldova, 100,000 people participated in the parade. This ancient city of five hundred years has regained its youth, and it appears even more beautiful after being dressed in festive attire.

	In Ukraine, the October festival coincided with the tenth anniversary of Kiev's liberation from the German fascist invaders. Early in the morning, the streets of Kiev were filled with songs and music. After a military parade on Khreshchatyk Street, a festive parade of 250,000 people was held. At the front of the procession were students, with the flags of various people's democratic countries fluttering above them, as if they were marching alongside their foreign friends. Workers and staff from various factories in Kiev reported their achievements. They have successfully completed this year's third-quarter plan, producing 13 percent more goods for the country than in the same period last year. Kiev's silk weaving factory, shoe factory, clothing factory, confectionery factory, and others have also responded to the government's call to overfulfill their production plans. Kiev has been restored from the ashes, and currently has 10 percent more housing than before the war.

	Throughout Belarus, from the banks of the Dnieper River to the western border of the Soviet state, the working people showed their loyalty to the cause of building communism in celebrating the festival. More than 150,000 people participated in the Minsk working people's festival parade.

	On the Baltic coast, grand festive parades were held in Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, and other cities. Tallinn, the ancient capital of Estonia, located on the Gulf of Finland, presented a joyful festive scene. In the postwar years, Tallinn has built a large number of well-equipped houses and industrial enterprises, and the city's industrial production is now three times that of the capitalist period. The people participating in the parade proudly held up banners showing the achievements of the republic's national economic development, fully demonstrating their unwavering will to defend peace and their determination to strengthen the Soviet motherland with selfless labor.

    苏联全国热烈庆祝十月革命节
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社消息：十一月七日，在苏联辽阔广大的国土上，千百万劳动人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月革命三十六周年。各地劳动人民都举行了盛大的节日游行，表现了他们在共产党及苏维埃政府周围的牢不可破的团结一致，表示了他们要巩固社会主义革命成果、全力维护和平事业和百折不挠地为实现共产党关于进一步提高人民生活水平的伟大纲领而努力的热烈愿望。
    当苏维埃远东庆祝活动开始的时候，莫斯科还是夜间。早晨金色的太阳唤醒了海参崴的居民。这时，海参崴已披起了节日盛装，到处都是鲜红的旗帜和标语牌。码头上的海船打扮得更加美丽了。海员、渔人、矿工、伐木工人、科学家和学生都欢欣鼓舞地参加了节日游行。在北部的雅库次克，北极光在寒冷明朗的夜里闪闪发亮。几千工人举行了盛大的游行示威。这座革命初期只有少数手工业工厂的居住区已发展成一个大中心城市了。
    在中亚细亚，哈萨克、乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克和吉尔吉斯等共和国的人民都以进一步加强各族人民友谊的精神来庆祝节日。在哈萨克首都阿拉木图，鲜红的横旗悬挂在宽阔的大街上，旗上用哈萨克文和俄文写着“共产党、苏维埃政府和人民的牢不可破的团结万岁！”的口号。乌兹别克成千上万的人在共和国首都塔什干的红场上列队游行。游行者高举着领袖像、巨幅横旗和报告生产成绩的图表。塔什干有二十五个企业提前完成了全年生产任务。几十个工厂的工人已增加了日用品、机器和农具的产量。
    在外高加索，阿塞拜疆、格鲁吉亚和亚美尼亚的人民都欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了自己的节日。巴库、第比利斯和埃里温都举行了历时数小时的节日游行。在摩尔达维亚的首都基什纽的街道上有十万人参加游行。这座五百年的古城已恢复了它的青春，披上节日的盛装后，它显得越发美丽了。
    在乌克兰，十月节和基辅从德国法西斯侵略者手中解放十周年纪念日同时举行。这一天基辅街道上一清早就到处洋溢着歌声和音乐声。克列什查地克大街举行了阅兵后，举行了二十五万人的节日游行。走在前面的是学生队伍，队伍上面飘扬着各人民民主国家的国旗，仿佛他们正在和他们的外国朋友并肩前进似的。基辅各工厂工人职员报告了他们的成就。他们已胜利地完成了今年第三季的计划，为国家生产了比去年同期多百分之十三的物品。基辅的丝织厂、制鞋厂、服装工厂、糖果工厂等也都响应政府号召超额完成了生产计划。基辅已经从灰烬中恢复起来了，目前它的住宅比战前多百分之十。
    在整个白俄罗斯，从第聂伯河岸直到苏维埃国家的西境，劳动人民都在欢庆节日中表现了他们对建设共产主义事业的忠诚。参加明斯克的劳动人民节日游行的有十五万多人。
    在波罗的海沿岸，塔林、里加、维尔那以及其他城市都举行了盛大的节日游行。濒临芬兰湾的爱沙尼亚首都——古老的塔林，呈现一片欢乐的节日景象。塔林在战后年代里已建造了大批设备优良的房屋和工业企业，现在市内工业企业的产品已为资本主义时期的三倍了。参加游行的人骄傲地高举着说明共和国国民经济发展成就的标语牌行进，充分显示了他们不屈不挠地保卫和平的意志和他们要以忘我劳动加强苏维埃祖国实力的决心。
