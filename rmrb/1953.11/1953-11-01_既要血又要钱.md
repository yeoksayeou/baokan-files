Wanting Both Blood and Money
    Gu Yin
    Wall Street bosses are the most stingy and the most greedy. At the beginning of the Korean War, when it needed others to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for it, it said to many countries: as long as you send people, I will provide you with guns and money. The United States is willing to "serve" in this way. As a result, fifteen countries successively sent troops to Korea to help the United States.
    Now, the American war of aggression against Korea has been forced to stop, and it has stopped at the same old place where the aggression began. So, in addition to being unhappy, the Wall Street boss immediately pulled out the bill, and stretched out his hand to the countries that had sent troops to Korea with him to ask for money: money for using American guns and cannons, money for wearing American military uniforms, money for eating American rations, and money for riding American ships. In short, the American "service" must not be in vain, and now it must all be taken back.
    Those countries that sent troops to Korea originally planned to pick up a bargain by following the United States. Of course, they did not expect that the war would not be won in the end, nor did they expect that their losses would be so serious, and even more unexpectedly, they would have to repay this debt of "service" to Wall Street. This is really "losing both the lady and the army," no wonder some countries are dumbfounded when they see the Wall Street bill.
    The United States originally said that its "service" was voluntary, but now it wants these countries to pay for its "service." But these countries are a little unwilling.
    Look! The American "Newsweek" on September 7 said: "Just wait for a fierce argument when the United States tries to collect equipment costs from Colombia for the Colombian infantry battalion that fought in Korea in the future." It also said: "The American idea of ​​what soldiers need seems too luxurious to Colombians. When Colombian officials learned that the bill totaled 10 million U.S. dollars, they were extremely angry." According to a "New York Times" reporter, the Colombian representative publicly stated at the United Nations headquarters: "If we knew that we had to pay for the equipment of the infantry battalion in Korea, then our soldiers would have thrown away the equipment and gone home long ago."
    The "New York Times" reporter also revealed: Many national representatives at the United Nations have expressed dissatisfaction with this gangster-like "fleecing" by the United States. He also said: "In the future, if the countries concerned encounter the fact that their soldiers must fight according to American 'standards' again...they may encounter some resistance."
    However, no matter how "extremely angry" they are, no matter how much they "regret it," no matter how much they may "resist" in the future, the Wall Street boss is now asking them for the bill.
    First squeeze blood, then extort money. This is the Wall Street way of life, this is the "cooperation" between the United States and its "friends," and this is the inevitable end for those countries that blindly follow the United States! (Attached picture)
    Now it's time for you to pay this bill, let's settle it!

　　既要血又要钱
    谷音
    华尔街老板是最吝啬的，也是最贫馋的。在朝鲜战争之初，当需要别人替它“火中取栗”时，它对许多国家说：只要你们出人，我就为你们出枪出钱，美国甘愿这样“效劳”。于是十五个国家先后派兵到朝鲜给美国帮凶去了。
    现在，美国侵略朝鲜的战争被迫停下来，而且还停在侵略开始时的老地方，于是华尔街老板在怏怏不乐之余，马上一手掏出了账单，一手伸出来向跟它一起出兵朝鲜的国家要钱了：用过美国的枪炮要钱，穿过美国的军装要钱，吃过美国的口粮要钱，坐过美国的轮船也要钱。总之，美国的“劳”决不能白“效”，现在都要收回来了。
    那些出兵朝鲜的国家，原来打算跟着美国去拣便宜的，他们当然没有想到战争最后还是没有打赢，也没有想到自己的损失会如此严重，更没有想到的是还要向华尔街偿还这笔“效劳”的债务。这真正是“赔了夫人又折兵”，难怪有的国家对着华尔街的账单目瞪口呆了。
    美国原来说它的“效劳”是甘心的，现在又要这些国家偿付它的“效劳”。但这些国家可有些不甘心了。
    看吧！九月七日的美国《新闻周刊》说：“将来美国试图向哥伦比亚收取曾在朝鲜作战的哥伦比亚步兵营的装备费用时，等着瞧一场激烈的争吵吧。”又说：“美国对于士兵之需要的想法，在哥伦比亚人看起来，好像是太奢侈了。当哥伦比亚的官员们知道这笔账总计一千万美元时，他们感到异常愤怒。”又据《纽约时报》记者报道：哥伦比亚代表在联合国总部公开地说：“假如我们知道必须偿付装备在朝鲜的步兵营的款项的话，那末我们的士兵早就扔掉那些装备回家去了。”
    《纽约时报》记者还透露：联合国的许多国家代表都对美国这种强盗式的“敲竹杠”表示不满。他并且说：“将来假如有关国家重新碰到那种事实，就是它们的士兵必须按照美国‘标准’去作战的话……可能遭到某种抵抗。”
    但是，不管“异常愤怒”也吧，不管“悔不当初”也吧，不管将来可能“抵抗”也吧，华尔街的老板现在是要向他们讨账了。
    先是榨取血，继而勒索钱，这就是华尔街的生活方式，这就是美国和它的“朋友们”的“合作”，这也就是那些一味追随美国的国家的必然下场！（附图片）
    现在这笔帐你该还了，我们来清算吧！
