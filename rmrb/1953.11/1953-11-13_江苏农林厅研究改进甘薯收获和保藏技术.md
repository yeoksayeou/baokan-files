The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department convened a sweet potato technology research conference in late September to strive for increased sweet potato (yam) yields and to ensure proper post-harvest storage to prevent spoilage.

Sweet potatoes are one of the main food sources for farmers in Jiangsu Province during the winter and spring seasons. The province's cultivation area this year is estimated to be over 5.8 million mu. Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Yancheng prefectures are key sweet potato cultivation areas in the province, accounting for more than 80% of the province's total cultivation area. However, last year, due to late harvesting of sweet potatoes in these areas, heavy autumn rains, and careless harvesting practices resulting in damaged sweet potato tubers, coupled with improper handling of bruised and pest-damaged tubers during storage, and imbalances in temperature and humidity within the storage cellars, severe spoilage occurred. Therefore, how to strive for increased sweet potato yields and prevent spoilage is an urgent problem to be solved in the province's current campaign to increase production and practice economy.

At the meeting, many labor models introduced experiences that proved the great potential for increasing sweet potato production. As long as proactive measures are taken, it is certain that sweet potato yields can be increased and the sweet potatoes can be stored well without spoilage. Li Rang, a labor model from Lianshui County, has been storing sweet potatoes every year for more than forty years, and because of good storage methods, none have spoiled. Zheng Changchun, a labor model from Shuyang County, had his sweet potatoes flooded last year, but because they were stored well, they did not spoil either. According to the labor models, in the past, due to rough harvesting practices, sweet potatoes were not harvested cleanly, and generally thirty to fifty jin were lost per mu. If the entire province adopted the method of careful harvesting, an additional 30 jin per mu would increase the harvest by 174.4 million jin.

After research, the conference put forward opinions on improving sweet potato harvesting and storage techniques.

First, it is necessary to grasp the season and harvest at the appropriate time to prevent sweet potatoes from being damaged by frost and spoilage.

Second, meticulous harvesting is essential to maximize yields. When harvesting, deep plowing and slow plowing should be carried out to pick up the sweet potatoes cleanly, minimize the loss of tubers, and reduce damage. All localities should grasp the harvesting season so that sweet potatoes are not damaged by frost. Generally, sunny days should be chosen to harvest sweet potatoes after the sun rises to avoid damage from cold air after they are turned out of the soil.

Third, prepare well before storage. First, select good sweet potatoes. All damaged, insect-spotted, or insect-damaged sweet potatoes must be removed to prevent germs from entering and causing spoilage. Handle with care when transporting and putting them into the cellar. Damaged and pest-damaged tubers can be eaten first or cut and dried; secondly, the cellar location is best in a high, dry, sunny, ventilated, clean place with a solid soil structure. For example, in Xuzhou Prefecture, where the groundwater level is low, farmers dig cellars seven to nine feet deep to store sweet potatoes, which is conducive to sweet potato storage. In Huaiyin Prefecture, where the groundwater level is higher, the cellars can only be dug three to four feet deep. Many farmers use the method of filling soil to raise the foundation and then digging deeper cellars, which is also very effective. In addition, disinfection should be done for old cellars or cellars that have spoiled sweet potatoes. There are many disinfection methods, such as burning with fire, sprinkling lime water, and removing old soil from the bottom and surrounding area of the cellar.

Fourth, strengthen the management of the sweet potato storage cellars. When sweet potatoes are first put into the cellar, attention must be paid to ventilation to equalize the temperature and humidity. Then, as the temperature changes, cover the outside and top of the cellar with grass and soil in stages, and seal the cellar door. Farmers in Xuzhou Prefecture use a storage method of alternating layers of sand and sweet potatoes, which is very effective. The best time to take sweet potatoes for eating is at noon on sunny days, and the shorter the time, the better, to avoid lowering the temperature inside the cellar.

Finally, in areas where sweet potatoes are harvested in large quantities or where there are difficulties in storage, they can also be cut and dried; however, attention should be paid to grasping the weather conditions and adopting methods such as early drying and phased drying to prevent loss from mold and spoilage due to cloudy and rainy weather.

    江苏农林厅研究改进甘薯收获和保藏技术
    江苏省人民政府农林厅为争取甘薯（即山芋）多收，并使甘薯在收获后保管好，不霉烂，于九月下旬召开了甘薯技术研究会议。
    甘薯为江苏省广大农民冬春两季的主要食粮之一。全省今年栽培面积估计有五百八十余万亩。徐州、淮阴、盐城专区各县，为全省甘薯重点栽培地区，占全省栽培总面积的百分之八十以上。但去年由于这些地方甘薯收获迟，秋雨多，收获时操作粗放，薯块伤损的多，加以下窖时对碰伤的和遭病虫害的薯块没作适当处理，窖内温度湿度失调，致造成了严重的霉烂现象。所以，如何设法争取甘薯多收和防止霉烂，是该省当前贯彻增产节约运动中急待解决的问题。
    会上许多劳动模范介绍的经验，证明甘薯增产的潜力很大，只要采取积极的办法，就一定能够提高甘薯的收获量，并把甘薯贮藏好而不使霉烂。涟水县劳动模范李让四十多年来，每年都贮藏甘薯，因为贮藏方法好，没有霉烂过。沭阳县劳动模范郑长春去年的甘薯虽然遭受水淹，但因为贮藏得好，也没有霉烂。据劳动模范们谈，过去各地因收获时操作粗放，甘薯收得不干净，一般每亩少收三十斤到五十斤，全省如果采取精收细收的办法，以每亩多收三十斤计算，就可增加收获量一亿七千四百万斤。
    会议经过研究，提出了关于改进甘薯收获、贮藏技术的意见。
    第一，要掌握季节适时收获，防止甘薯遭受冻害和发生霉烂。
    第二，要做到细收，争取多收。收获时要深耕、慢耕，把甘薯拾干净，尽力减少薯块的丢失，减少破损。各地要掌握收获季节，以使甘薯不遭冻害。一般要选择天气晴朗的日子，在太阳上升后收甘薯，以免翻出土后被冷空气冻坏。
    第三，要做好贮藏前的准备工作。首先选好甘薯，凡是破损、有虫斑虫伤的，都要剔除，以防病菌侵入引起霉烂。搬运和入窖时要轻放。选出有伤损、病虫害的薯块，可以先吃或是切晒干子；其次，窖子地点，最好是在高燥、向阳、通风、清洁、土壤结构坚固的地方。如徐州专区各县地下水位低，农民放甘薯的窖子挖了七尺到九尺深，这是有利于甘薯贮藏的。在地下水位较高的淮阴专区，窖子只能挖三四尺深，有不少农民用填土加高地基再挖深窖的办法，也是很有效的。此外，对利用旧窖，或是霉烂过甘薯的窖子，要做好消毒工作。消毒办法很多，如火烧、撒石灰水、铲去窖底及周围旧土都可以。
    第四，要加强对存放甘薯的窖子的管理。甘薯初入窖时，必须注意通风，使温度湿度调匀，以后随着气温的变化，再分期在窖外、窖顶盖草培土，封闭窖门。徐州专区农民采用一层沙土一层甘薯的贮藏法，效果很好。取食甘薯的时间，最好是晴天的中午，时间愈短愈好，以免降低窖内温度。
    最后，在甘薯收得多，或是贮藏有困难的地方，还可以把它切晒成干子；但要注意掌握天时，采取早晒、分期晒等办法，以防止阴雨霉烂损失。
