    Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Issues Three Directives
    Vigorously Publicize the General Line to the People
    [This newspaper dispatch] Since October, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has successively issued three directives, and convened a meeting on November 19 to determine that the central task of the Party's political and ideological work in the next two or three months is to mobilize Party and non-Party cadres in the entire region to study the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, and at the same time, vigorously publicize it to the people.
    The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee emphasized: In the process of studying and publicizing the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, Party members and cadres should, on the basis of deeply understanding the general line and general task, review and summarize their work, conduct annual appraisals of cadres, and arrange the work for next year, specifically criticize the capitalist ideology of some Party members, especially Party cadres, draw a clear ideological line between socialism and capitalism, raise the laboring people's awareness of socialism, greatly promote work such as increasing production and practicing economy, agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, ensure the successful completion of grain work, and then bring all work into the orbit of the general line.
    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over this study and publicity work, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically stipulated: First, the main responsible persons of the Party committees of each province and city should personally lead and control this study. The Party's propaganda departments should specifically be responsible for formulating feasible study plans, promptly checking the study situation, collecting the problems that occur in the study, and organizing necessary answers and reports; second, it is determined that Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary, Zhao Boping, Minister of the Propaganda Department, Wang Feng, Minister of the United Front Work Department, Pan Zili, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, Bai Rubing, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northwest Administrative Committee, and Fang Zhongru, Second Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPC, shall be chief lecturers, respectively lecturing on relevant issues of the Party's general line and general task during the transition period; third, Party responsible cadres of relevant departments should earnestly study the Party's general line and general task in combination with their own work, and strengthen the leadership of the senior groups and help the intermediate groups understand various important issues through this study; fourth, the Party organizations of all agencies and departments must convey the Party's general line and general task to the cadres of the primary groups and cultural groups and all service personnel in November, and organize discussions.
    The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee requested that Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to publicizing the general line to the people, and specifically stipulated: The film departments should immediately make plans, select newsreels about China's industrial construction and feature films depicting the life of Soviet collective farmers that farmers can understand, select key areas, and go deep into the countryside for mobile screenings; local theater troupes should prepare some scripts about the comparison between the old and new societies and the description of the new life, and go to various market towns and larger rural areas for mobile performances; literary and art workers should, through the practical experiences of the past period, vividly depict the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation and the examples of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the examples of the struggle between advanced and backward ideas that have already appeared in the grain problem, and the advanced farmers who enthusiastically sell grain to the state, and widely publicize them; the education departments should start compiling winter school textbooks to publicize the general line, the general task, and relevant rural policies, and report to all rural primary schools, people-run schools, and winter school teachers.
    The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also requested that while vigorously publicizing the state's general line during the transition period to farmers this winter, all localities should further develop the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in accordance with the principle of "active leadership, steady progress." This winter and next spring, the entire region should increase the number of mutual aid teams by about 10% on the existing basis; before March next year, in addition to the current 300 agricultural production cooperatives in the entire region, about 300 more should be established. The supply and marketing cooperative organizations in rural areas should also be appropriately developed during the same period. In November and December, all localities should train the existing agricultural production cooperatives and the backbone elements of the mutual aid teams that are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives, as well as the county, district, and township cadres participating in the work of establishing cooperatives. The content of the training should focus on explaining the Party's general line during the transition period, how to transform the backward, scattered small-scale peasant economy into an advanced, cooperative socialist agricultural economy in accordance with the principle of voluntariness, the inevitable process of realizing socialism, the two paths and two futures of socialism and capitalism, and the main experience of the management of agricultural production cooperatives and the working methods of establishing cooperatives. In addition, the responsible persons of the existing agricultural production cooperatives should report on the specific processes and experiences of their cooperative management, and visits can be organized when necessary.

    大张旗鼓向人民群众宣传总路线
    【本报讯】中共中央西北局从十月份以来先后发出三次指示，并在十一月十九日召开会议，确定党在最近两、三个月内的政治思想工作的中心，是动员全区党与非党干部学习国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务，同时大张旗鼓地向人民群众进行宣传。
    中共中央西北局着重指出：在学习和宣传国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的过程中，应使党员干部在深刻领会总路线、总任务的基础上，检查和总结工作，进行干部年终鉴定和布置明年工作，具体批判某些党员首先是党员干部中的资本主义思想，划清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，提高劳动人民对于社会主义的觉悟，把增产节约、农业互助合作等工作大大推进一步，保证粮食工作的胜利完成，进而把全部工作纳入总路线的轨道。
    为了加强党对于这次学习和宣传工作的领导，中共中央西北局具体规定：一、各省、市党的委员会的主要负责人，应亲自领导和掌握这次学习。党的宣传部门应具体负责拟订切实可行的学习计划，及时检查学习情况，搜集学习中发生的问题，组织必要的解答和报告；二、确定中共中央西北局第三书记马明方、副书记马文瑞、宣传部部长赵伯平、统一战线工作部部长汪锋、中共陕西省委员会书记潘自力、西北行政委员会财政经济委员会副主任白如冰、中共西安市委员会第二书记方仲如等为主任讲师，分别讲授党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的有关问题；三、有关部门的党员负责干部应结合本身业务切实研究党的总路线和总任务，并通过这种研究来加强对高级组的领导和帮助中级组对各项重要问题的了解；四、一切机关和部门的党的组织，必须在十一月份内向初级组、文化组的干部和全体勤杂人员进行关于党的总路线和总任务的传达，并组织讨论。
    中共中央西北局要求各级党委必须十分重视向人民群众宣传总路线的工作，并具体规定：电影部门应立即作好计划，挑选农民能看懂的有关我国工业建设方面的新闻纪录片和描写苏联集体农民生活的故事片，选择重点地区，深入农村巡回放映；各地剧团应准备一些有关新旧社会对比的和描写新生活的剧本，到各集镇和较大的农村中去巡回演出；文艺工作者应通过过去一个时期的生活实践，把互助合作的优越性和农民参加互助合作组织的范例，把已经出现在粮食问题上的先进思想与落后思想斗争的实例，把踊跃卖粮给国家的先进农民等，通俗地描绘出来，广泛进行宣传；教育部门应着手编写宣传总路线、总任务和有关农村政策的冬学课本，并向所有农村小学、民校和冬学教员作报告。
    中共中央西北局还要求各地在今冬大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线的同时，应按照
  “积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，进一步发展农业互助合作运动。今冬明春全区要在现有的基础上增加互助组百分之十左右；在明年三月以前，除全区现在的三百个农业生产合作社外，再增办三百个左右。农村中的供销合作组织在同一时期内也要适当发展。在十一、十二月内，各地应将现有的农业生产合作社和准备办农业生产合作社的互助组的骨干分子以及参加办社工作的县、区、乡干部加以训练。训练的内容应着重讲解党在过渡时期的总路线，怎样按自愿原则把落后的分散的小农经济改造为先进的合作化的社会主义农业经济，实现社会主义所必经的过程，对社会主义和资本主义两条道路两个前途等问题，以及农业生产合作社经营管理的主要经验和进行办社的工作方法等。此外，应由现有的农业生产合作社负责人，报告他们办社的具体过程和经验，必要时可以组织参观。
