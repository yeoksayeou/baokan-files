Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th. Under the control of the American "embargo" policy, Indonesia's rubber exports continued to decline this year. As the United States intensifies its efforts to exploit the shrinking rubber market after implementing the "embargo" policy, using various means to suppress rubber prices, Indonesia's sharp decline in rubber sales revenue is more severe than the reduction in rubber export volume.

According to figures announced by the Indonesian government, Indonesia's rubber exports from January to September this year amounted to just over 530,000 tons, a decrease of more than 14,700 tons compared to the same period last year. However, Indonesia's income from rubber exports fell from 3.106 billion Indonesian Rupiahs from January to September 1952 to 2.47 billion Indonesian Rupiahs from January to September this year; a decrease of 636 million Indonesian Rupiahs. Indonesia, which relies on rubber exports as its largest source of foreign exchange income, has therefore been severely affected economically.

The United States adopts discriminatory policies against the products of Indonesian-owned medium and small rubber plantations, giving Indonesian small rubber producers a particularly heavy blow. In Indonesian official statistics, the export volume of medium and small rubber plantation products, listed as civilian rubber, fell sharply from more than 347,000 tons from January to September 1952 to more than 294,000 tons from January to September this year, a decrease of more than 52,600 tons. Therefore, Indonesia's rubber production has been greatly reduced. According to Agence France-Presse, 100,000 tons of rubber produced by medium and small rubber plantations currently cannot be sold.

However, while discriminating against Indonesian civilian rubber, the United States is increasing its purchases of rubber from large Dutch-capital rubber plantations in Indonesia. The United States is using the tactic of currying favor with large Dutch planters to undermine the possibility of British rubber planters in Malaya and Dutch rubber planters in Indonesia taking joint measures in rubber sales, in order to further suppress rubber prices, especially to suppress Britain's bargaining power in Malayan rubber. As a result of the measures adopted by the United States, the export volume of rubber produced by large Indonesian rubber plantations owned by Dutch capitalists has increased from 198,000 tons from January to September 1952 to more than 235,000 tons from January to September this year.

### 美国使用各种手段压低胶价  印尼橡胶出口下降生产减少

    美国使用各种手段压低胶价
    印尼橡胶出口下降生产减少
    【新华社十日讯】雅加达消息：在美国“禁运”政策的控制下，今年印尼的橡胶出口继续减少。由于美国加紧利用在实施“禁运”政策后橡胶市场缩小的情况，使用各种手段来压低橡胶价格，印尼出售橡胶收入的猛烈下降，比橡胶出口数量的减少更为严重。
    据印尼官方宣布的数字，今年一月到九月印尼橡胶出口数量为五十三万吨强，比去年同期间减少了一万四千七百多吨；而印尼输出橡胶的收入，却从一九五二年一月到九月的印尼币三十一亿零六百万盾下降到今年一月到九月的二十四亿七千万盾；收入减少了六亿三千六百万盾。依靠输出橡胶作为最大的外汇收入来源的印尼，因此在经济上受到了严重影响。
    美国对印尼人所有的中、小胶园的产品，采取歧视的政策，给予印尼橡胶小生产者以特别沉重的打击。在印尼官方统计中列为民间橡胶的中、小橡胶园产品，出口数量从一九五二年一月到九月的三十四万七千多吨猛烈下降到今年一月到九月的二十九万四千多吨，减少达五万二千六百多吨。因此，印尼橡胶的生产已经大大减少。而据法新社报道：目前中、小橡胶园出产的橡胶还有十万吨无法卖出。
    然而，美国在歧视印尼民间橡胶的同时，却向在印尼的荷兰资本大橡胶园增加购橡胶量。美国正使用笼络荷兰大园主的手段，来破坏在马来亚的英国橡胶园主与在印尼的荷兰橡胶园主在销售橡胶方面采取联合措施的可能性，以便进一步压低橡胶价格，特别是压抑英国在马来亚橡胶方面的讨价还价的力量。美国采用这种措施的结果，荷兰资本家的印尼大橡胶园出产的橡胶出口量，反而从一九五二年一月到九月的十九万八千吨增加到今年一月到九月的二十三万五千多吨。
