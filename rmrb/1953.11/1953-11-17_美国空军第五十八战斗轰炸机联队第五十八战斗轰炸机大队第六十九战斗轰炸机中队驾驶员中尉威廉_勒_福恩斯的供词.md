Confession of Lieutenant William L. Fonvielle, Pilot of the 69th Bombardment Squadron, 58th Bombardment Group, 58th Bombardment Wing, U.S. Air Force

    My name is William L. Fonvielle, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant, service number AO—1862639. I was born on December 1, 1928, in Afflex, Kentucky, and currently reside at 208 Allegheny Street, Christiansburg, Virginia. I received basic flight training at Perrin Air Force Base in Sherman, Texas, and advanced flight training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, Arizona. After completing pilot training at Williams in October 1951, I was sent for gunnery training. I left San Francisco on a troop transport ship around January 25, 1952, and arrived in Yokohama, Japan, around February 8, 1952. I was then assigned to the 136th Fighter-Bomber Wing, now renumbered as the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing.
    I was shot down on my 50th mission around August 6, 1952. I participated in five missions dropping germ bombs.
    Around February 15, 1952, when I arrived at Daegu (K-2), I was assigned to the 111th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the 136th Fighter-Bomber Group. About a week later, I and some other new arrivals in the group were called to attend several meetings. In the meetings, Major Colgan gave us reports on various aspects of our stay in Korea.
    Two or three days after arriving at K-2 base, I, along with Lieutenant Dunn, Lieutenant James, Lieutenant Stanley, Lieutenant Mahaffey, Lieutenant Cleland, Lieutenant Piche, Lieutenant Palmgreen, and other pilots, were sent to Japan because there were still some days before training with the training team began. I arrived at Itazuke around March 1. The next day, I was notified that I had to attend a class in the theater in the morning. I went to the theater with the aforementioned pilots. Among the approximately fifty people attending the class, I only knew my friends.
    The lecture was given by a Mr. Schmidt, who was about fifty years old. At the beginning of the lecture, Mr. Schmidt said that no one should disclose any information about the lecture, not even among ourselves, and should not discuss it outside this room. Then he continued to talk about previous experiments in germ warfare. He said that due to climate and terrain, it was difficult to find the best way to spread diseases, but after a long period of effort, several diseases and methods were found. Regarding these diseases, I only remember diphtheria, malaria, typhus, typhoid fever, yellow fever, and cholera. Regarding methods, he said that germ-carrying insect bombs were the most effective, and these insects were mosquitoes, flies, ants, and lice. He said that the military situation in Korea might justify or necessitate the use of these weapons to weaken the enemy, because once they were entrenched in the mountains, it was virtually impossible to dislodge them with ordinary weapons.
    Mr. Schmidt then talked about different types of germ bombs. The first type was a thousand-pound germ bomb containing germ-carrying insects. Externally, this type of bomb was exactly like a thousand-pound conventional bomb.
    The five-hundred-pound germ bomb was similar to the thousand-pound bomb, but there was another type of five-hundred-pound germ bomb that was designed to poison water sources. This type of bomb had the same construction as the insect germ bomb, but instead of germ-carrying insects, it contained a solution.
    After the germ warfare lecture, Mr. Schmidt gave us lectures on chemical warfare and atomic warfare. At the end of the atomic warfare lecture, a film called "Atomic Weapons" was shown.
    After the class in Itazuke, I returned to K-2 base. Around March 15, before the training team training began, I and the aforementioned personnel again attended a germ warfare lecture given by Major Colgan. He first told us about the germ warfare mission assigned to our group, that the group must maintain full readiness for germ warfare as much as possible, and if necessary, mobilize all personnel.
    He then talked about how F-84 aircraft could participate in germ warfare. Previously, the group's mission was mostly to cut railway lines, and the group had tried to maintain constant reconnaissance and surveillance of the railway lines, but the efficiency of repairs was very high. Therefore, according to this plan, each time a mission was carried out, a flight had to be equipped with germ bombs to delay the repair of the railway lines.
    If an accident occurred while carrying this type of bomb, the bomb should not be returned to base but should be dropped in a "safe" location at sea. An area ten miles east of Pohang (K-3) was specifically designated for this purpose.
    My first germ warfare mission was around May 15. The briefing for this mission was conducted in the same way. The operations officer told us the target and type of mission, which was to cut the railway north of Anju. The bombs carried were two thousand-pound conventional bombs. The route to the target was via K-14, Chinnampo, and then towards the target. There were six flights in this mission, with two flights each from the then 111th Squadron, 154th Squadron, and 182nd Squadron. Captain Wisecamper was the leader of my flight, and Lieutenant Piche was a member. The operations officer gave us the mission number, takeoff, engine start, and time of arrival at the target, fuel load, and other necessary information. The intelligence officer, meteorologist, and ground liaison officer then gave their general briefings. My flight was left behind for a special briefing.
    This special briefing was conducted by Lieutenant Eads, then assistant operations officer of the group. He briefed that each of our aircraft would carry two five-hundred-pound germ bombs. This was a mission to cut railway lines, and we should arrive over the target last and drop the germ bombs near the target. We should drop the bombs from an altitude of about five thousand feet. He told us that if we had to turn back, we should use the emergency bomb disposal area.
    Captain Wisecamper told us before the flight that we had to circle at high altitude until the last person in the group left the target before dropping the bombs. Our flight's bombs were two five-hundred-pound germ bombs per aircraft.
    We took off around 13:00 and arrived over the target around 14:00. The altitude to the target was 25,000 feet, and our flight dropped the germ bombs at a higher altitude than usual. The altitude on the way back from the target was 30,000 feet. In the debriefing, the flight leader reported that the germ bombs had been dropped on the target.
    My second germ warfare mission was around May 30. Our group received a briefing to cut the railway line north of Gunuri. There were four flights participating in this mission, with "D" flight consisting of Captain Hunter, Lieutenant Pollock, Lieutenant Bowling, and me. The operations officer giving the briefing ordered "D" flight to drop bombs last and conduct reconnaissance of the railway line and the city of Gunuri to the south. The bombs carried by the group were five-hundred-pound conventional bombs, and "D" flight had two five-hundred-pound germ bombs per aircraft. There was no special briefing for this mission because the briefing on germ weapons was given in the regular briefing. The mission was carried out as briefed, and the germ bombs were dropped from an altitude of about five thousand feet. The debriefing was as usual.
    My third germ warfare mission was around June 1. The group was briefed to bomb the railway bridge over the Chongchon River south of Huichon. There were a total of five flights participating in this mission, led by Major Colgan, who was also the leader of "A" flight. The other members of "A" flight were Lieutenant Reagan, Lieutenant Cleland, and me. The bombs carried by the group were five-hundred-pound conventional bombs, and "A" flight carried two germ bombs per aircraft. During the squadron briefing, Major Colgan said that "A" flight would circle at high altitude until the last flight left the target. We would not drop the bombs perpendicularly to the river, but would fly parallel to the river and drop the bombs, dropping our germ bombs near the bridge to contaminate the water flow. We took off around 17:00 and arrived at the target around 18:00. The mission was carried out as briefed, and I saw the bombs dropped into the water. The debriefing was as usual, but it was mentioned that MiG aircraft had been spotted.
    Around July 30, during my fourth germ warfare mission, the group was briefed to bomb the supply area south of Wonsan. Six flights participated in this mission, with "F" flight consisting of Lieutenant Salisbury, Lieutenant Dunn, Lieutenant Hart, and me. My flight was ordered to enter the target area last. My flight's bomb load was two five-hundred-pound germ bombs per aircraft. This mission was carried out as briefed. During the debriefing, Lieutenant Salisbury reported that the germ bombs had been dropped on the target area.
    My fifth germ warfare mission was on August 6, 1952. According to the briefing, this mission was to destroy the railway bridge across the Chongchon River north of Huichon. There were six flights in this mission, with "E" flight led by Lieutenant Salisbury, and I was his wingman. Captain Shalley flew as number three, and Lieutenant Hart flew as number four. My flight carried one five-hundred-pound germ bomb and one five-hundred-pound conventional bomb per aircraft. The route to the target was directly to the target via the MR radio station located in Cheorwon.
    We took off around 16:00 and flew to the target along the route specified in the briefing without incident. When we arrived at the target, numbers three and four of my flight suddenly disappeared. Lieutenant Salisbury and I circled north of the target for several weeks to look for numbers three and four, but without success. Before we made our bombing run, the other five flights had already dropped their bombs and returned. Lieutenant Salisbury and I dropped our bombs, then climbed and circled over the target, searching again for numbers three and four. When the two men returned to the flight, the flight began to fly south. Just after leaving the target, the flight was attacked by MiG aircraft, and I was shot down.
    After being captured, I began to see the destruction that I had participated in inflicting upon peaceful people. I only saw one city—Pyongyang—but when I saw it, my heart grew heavy. That city was completely reduced to ruins, from factories to hospitals, from residences to churches, nothing remained. I saw men, women, and children suffering equally in the destruction. When I saw these things, I felt ashamed and humbled. I began to think and began to realize what I had done to the Chinese and Korean people. I voluntarily and sincerely reveal these crimes that I have committed and repent for every crime.

    美国空军第五十八战斗轰炸机联队第五十八战斗轰炸机大队第六十九战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉威廉·勒·福恩斯的供词
    我的名字是威廉·勒·福恩斯，美国空军中尉，军号AO—1862639，我于一九二八年十二月一日生于肯塔基州的阿弗拉克斯，现住在弗吉尼亚州克利斯提安斯堡阿莱甘尼街二○八号。我在得克萨斯州歇尔曼的培林空军基地受基本驾驶训练，在亚利桑那州詹德勒的威廉姆斯空军基地受高级驾驶训练。一九五一年十月在威廉姆斯受完了驾驶员训练后，我被送去受射击训练。我于一九五二年一月二十五日乘部队运输舰离开旧金山，约于一九五二年二月八日到达日本横滨，后即派至第一三六战斗轰炸机联队，该队现改番号为第五十八战斗轰炸机联队。
    我在一九五二年八月六日执行第五十次任务中被击落，我参加过五次投掷细菌弹任务。
    一九五二年二月十五日左右，我到大邱（K—2）时，我被派到第一三六战斗轰炸机大队的第一一一战斗轰炸机中队。约一星期后，我和大队里其他一些新到人员应召去参加了几次会。会中由科尔甘少校给我们作有关我们停留在朝鲜的各种情况的报告。
    在K—2基地又过了两三天以后，我与登恩少尉、詹姆斯中尉、斯坦莱中尉、马哈菲少尉、克利兰德少尉、皮契少尉、帕姆格伦少尉及其他一些驾驶员一起被送往日本，因为离开参加训练队的训练还有一些日子。我于三月一日左右到达板付。第二天，我得到通知早晨要在戏院上课。我与上述的驾驶员去到戏院，参加上课的约五十个人中间，我只认识我的朋友们。
    讲课由一位约莫五十多岁的施密特先生主持。施密特先生在讲课开始时说，每人都不可泄露有关讲课的任何情报，甚至在我们自己中间亦不可在此室外谈论。然后他继续谈到关于以前进行的细菌战的实验。他说由于气候和地形的关系，要找到散布疾病的最好的方法是困难的，但是经过长时间的努力，毕竟找到了几种疾病和方法。关于这些疾病，我只记得白喉、疟疾、斑疹伤寒、伤寒、黄热病和霍乱。关于方法，他说带菌昆虫炸弹是最有效的，这些昆虫是蚊子、苍蝇、蚂蚁和虱子。他说朝鲜的军事形势可能有理由或需要使用这些武器以削弱敌人。因为他们一经驻守山区，用普通武器实际上不能把他们逐出。
    施密特先生随后谈到不同种类的细菌弹。第一种为一千磅大小的，装有带菌昆虫的细菌弹。从外表看，此种炸弹与一千磅普通炸弹完全相像。
    五百磅型细菌弹与一千磅相似，但另有一种五百磅细菌弹为毒化水源弹。此种炸弹与昆虫细菌弹构造相同，但内部装的不是带菌昆虫，而是一种溶液。
    在细菌战讲课以后，施密特先生给我们上了化学战和原子战的课。在原子战课末，放映了名为 “原子武器”的一场电影。
    在板付上课以后，我回到了K—2基地。在三月十五日左右，训练队训练开始以前，我又和上述人员参加了科尔甘少校主持的一次细菌战的讲课。他首先告诉我们指派给我们大队的细菌战任务，大队必须尽可能保持进行细菌战的充分准备，如有必要，全体出动。
    他继又讲到F—84飞机如何参加进行细菌战。以前大队的任务绝大部分是切断铁道，大队曾努力对铁路线保持不断的侦察监视，但修复的效率非常的大。因此采用这一种计划，在每次出发执行任务时，必须有一个小队配备细菌弹，以延缓铁路线的修复。
    携带此种炸弹，如在空中遇见意外，炸弹不得带返基地，应投入海中的“安全”地点。浦项（K—3）以东十英里有一区域即专作此用。
    我的第一次细菌战任务是在五月十五日左右。这次任务的简令同样的进行。作战官告诉我们目标及任务种类，是切断新安州以北的铁路。所携带的炸弹是两个一千磅普通炸弹。去目标的路线是经由K—14、镇南浦，然后飞向目标。这次任务有六个小队，由当时的第一一一中队、一五四中队、一八二中队各出二个小队。威塞康帕上尉是我的小队领队，皮契少尉是成员之一。作战官给予我们任务号码、起飞、发动引擎及到达目标之时间、载油量及其他必要的情报。情报官、气象官和地面联络官接着进行他们的一般简令。我的小队被留下作特殊简令。
    此特殊简令由当时大队助理作战官埃兹中尉主持。他作简令说，我们每机将携带两枚五百磅型细菌弹。这次是切断铁路线的任务，我们应在最后到达目标上空，在目标临近之地投下细菌弹。我们应于约五千英尺的高度投弹。他告诉我们，如中途折回，应使用紧急投弹区。
    威塞康帕上尉在飞行前告诉我们说，我们必须在高空盘旋，直至大队中最后一人离开目标后再进行投弹。我们小队的炸弹是每机两枚五百磅型的细菌弹。
    我们约在十三时起飞，约十四时到达目标上空。去目标时高度为二万五千英尺，我们小队将细菌弹于较一般为高之高度投下。从目标回来的高度为三万英尺。汇报中，小队领队报告细菌弹已投入目标。
    我的第二次细菌战任务约在五月三十日左右。我们大队接受切断军隅里以北铁路线的简令。执行此次任务的有四个小队，其中“D”队由亨特尔上尉、波洛克中尉、鲍林中尉和我组成。授简令的作战官令“D”小队最后投弹和沿线向南侦察铁路线及军隅里城。大队所携炸弹为五百磅普通炸弹， “D”小队每架飞机有两枚五百磅型的细菌弹。这次任务没有特别简令，因为关于细菌武器的简令是在正规简令中下达。任务按简令执行，细菌弹于约五千英尺的高度投掷，汇报如常。
    我的第三次细菌战任务约在六月一日左右。大队受简令轰炸熙川以南清川江上的铁路桥梁。参加此次任务的共有五个小队，由科尔甘少校领队，他同时又是“A”小队的领队，“A”小队其余人员为里根中尉、克利兰德少尉和我。大队所带炸弹为五百磅普通炸弹，“A”小队每机带两枚细菌弹。在传达中队简令时，科尔甘少校称“A”小队将在高空中盘旋，直到最后一队飞离目标。我们并不横对河流进行投弹，而是与河流平行飞行，进行投弹，于靠近桥梁处投下我们的细菌弹，以污染水流。我们约在十七时起飞，到达目标的时间约为十八时。任务按照简令执行，我见到炸弹投入水中。汇报如常，但提及曾发现米格飞机。
    七月三十日左右，在我的第四次细菌战任务中，大队受简令炸毁元山以南供给区。该次任务有六个小队参加，其中“F”小队由萨利斯柏利中尉、登恩中尉、哈特中尉和我组成。我的小队受简令最后进入目标区域上空。我的小队的炸弹装载是每机两枚五百磅型的细菌弹。此次任务按简令执行。汇报时，萨利斯柏利中尉报告细菌弹已投入目标地区。
    我的第五次细菌战任务是在一九五二年八月六日。依照简令，这次任务是破坏熙川以北跨越清川江的铁路桥梁。这次任务有六个小队，其中“E”小队是萨利斯柏利中尉担任小队领队，我是他的僚机，夏雷上尉飞三号机，哈特中尉飞四号机。我的小队每架飞机携带一枚五百磅型的细菌弹和一枚五百磅的普通炸弹。去目标的路线是经由设在铁原的MR无线电台直达目标。
    我们在十六时左右起飞，按简令规定航线飞向目标，未出事故。当我们到达目标时，我的小队的三号机与四号机忽然不见了。萨利斯柏利中尉和我在目标之北盘旋数周，以寻找三号机与四号机，但未成功。在我们作投弹飞行前，其他五个小队已投弹返航。萨利斯柏利中尉和我投了弹，然后升到目标上空盘旋，再度寻找三号机与四号机。当该两人归队时，小队开始向南飞行。刚刚离开目标，小队即受到米格飞机的攻击，我遂被击落。
    我被俘以后，开始看到我所参加过的所加于和平人民的破坏。我只见到一个城市——平壤，但当我看见时，我的心沉重了。那个城市完全化为废墟，从工厂到医院，从住宅到教堂，没有一点余留。我看见男人、妇女和儿童同样的在破坏中遭受着痛苦。当我看到这些，我感到羞耻和卑微。我开始想并开始认识我对中朝人民做了些什么事。我自愿和诚恳地揭露我犯过的这些罪过，并为每一件罪行而忏悔。威廉·勒·福恩斯（签名）美国空军中尉军号AO—1862639一九五二年八月二十七日
