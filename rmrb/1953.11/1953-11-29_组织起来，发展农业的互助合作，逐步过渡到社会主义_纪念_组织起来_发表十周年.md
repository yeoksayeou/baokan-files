    Organize, Develop Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation, and Gradually Transition to Socialism
    —In Commemoration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Publication of "Get Organized!"
  　Liao Luyan
    On November 29, 1943, Chairman Mao made a historically significant speech on the direction of agricultural production development at a reception for labor heroes in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Chairman Mao pointed out: "As for the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been engaged in individual economy, with each household as a production unit. This dispersed individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it leaves the peasants themselves in perpetual poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is gradual collectivization, and the only road to collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives."
    During the most difficult Anti-Japanese War in the enemy's rear and in the subsequent People's Liberation War against Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, the peasants in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other liberated areas, after land reform in the form of rent reduction, interest rate reduction, reasonable burden, and land distribution to varying degrees, followed Chairman Mao's wise instruction to "organize into a labor army," giving full play to the superiority of collective labor. Generally, two people could do the work of three, greatly increasing agricultural labor productivity. During these difficult times and the days of great battles, Chairman Mao's call played a huge role in overcoming the economic and financial difficulties of the liberated areas, defeating the economic blockade of domestic and foreign enemies, and advancing agricultural production. Chairman Mao gave a very high appraisal of the mutual aid teams and work-exchange teams at that time. He believed that although this kind of production cooperation "did not fundamentally change the means of production, and the results of production were not public but private, the relations of production between people changed: this is a revolution in the production system, this is the second revolution." ("Speech at the High-Level Cadre Meeting of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1942")
    After the victory of the People's Revolution throughout the country, mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production developed in both the old and newly liberated areas on the basis of the successful completion of land reform. Although in some places, due to the recent completion of land reform, mutual aid and cooperation was not actively promoted for a time; or because the truth that gradual collectivization through cooperatives, as instructed by Chairman Mao, is the only way to overcome the dispersed individual economy, was not deeply understood or even ignored, a laissez-faire attitude was once adopted towards mutual aid and cooperation. However, after the Party Central Committee made a resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in the winter of 1951, these situations immediately changed. In the past two years, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed on a larger and better scale throughout the country. That China's agricultural production was able to reach and surpass the pre-Anti-Japanese War level in 1952 was certainly due to the coordination of various aspects of work, but it must be understood that the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement was an important factor. According to statistics in October this year, more than 47 million peasant households have been organized into temporary mutual aid teams, year-round mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 40 percent of the total number of rural households in the country, and the proportion in the agricultural population is even higher. There are now more than 14,000 agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature, characterized by land shares and unified management. From mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts, to semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, and then to higher-level fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives (that is, collective farms), this concrete path of gradually transforming small-scale peasant economy and gradually transitioning to socialism has become a program and task understood, accepted, and practiced by many peasant masses (especially the peasant masses in the old liberated areas). They have learned from practice that this is the road they must take for their own economic development, and the road they must take to highly develop agricultural production, thereby greatly improving their own lives.
    Not only has there been a mass-scale mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production, but also in the supply of means of production and livelihood to peasants and the marketing of agricultural and sideline products, supply and marketing cooperatives have become a nationwide new type of commercial network, with 32,000 grassroots cooperatives and more than 100 million members, distributed in rural areas throughout the country. In addition, organizational forms such as credit groups, credit cooperatives, and credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives have been adopted to initially develop credit cooperation in rural areas. The combination of agricultural production cooperation, rural supply and marketing cooperation, and rural credit cooperation, which promote each other and develop together, will undoubtedly gradually realize rural cooperativization. Chairman Mao said that with these cooperatives, "we can organize the strength of the masses into a labor army. This is the only way for the people to be liberated and the only way to change from poverty to prosperity."
    Our country's planned economic construction has already begun, and the decentralization of the individual agricultural economy is incompatible with the planned nature of the national economy. The development of industry requires a corresponding development of agriculture, requiring a large increase in the production of grain, cotton, and other raw materials; while the increase in production of the individual economy is limited, which cannot meet the needs of national industrialization, nor can it meet the needs of the continuous improvement of people's lives. One of the general lines and tasks of the transition period is to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, and gradually guide all peasants to collectively produce a socialist society where everyone becomes wealthy. This is a process of overcoming the contradiction between the individual economy and the collective economy. The individual economy constantly breeds capitalist factors. If this spontaneous force of capitalism is allowed to run rampant freely, the result will be that a very small number of people get rich by exploitation and become rich peasants, and the vast majority of peasants will be exploited into destitution and bankruptcy. If we are content with the status quo of the individual small-scale peasant economy and do not actively guide the peasants to get organized, engage in mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually transition to socialism, then the polarization in the countryside will greatly develop. That is to say, if socialism does not occupy the rural front, capitalism will inevitably occupy it; the result will be hindering the development of agricultural production, creating an imbalance between the development of agriculture and industry, thereby destroying planned economic construction, destroying the country's socialist industrialization, and also causing the vast number of peasants to lose the fruits they gained in the land reform, and fall back into bankruptcy and poverty, with extremely painful lives. This harms the country, harms all the people, and harms the vast number of peasants. The road of organizing and mutual aid and cooperation pointed out by Chairman Mao to Chinese peasants ten years ago has become a concrete road to realize our country's general line and general tasks in the current transition period and to transform the individual agricultural economy. Following this bright road forward, we will surely be able to greatly improve agricultural production, gradually increase the planning of agricultural production, defeat the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside, thereby guaranteeing the country's planned economic construction, supporting socialist industrialization, and also guaranteeing the continuous improvement of the material and cultural lives of the vast number of peasants; this is beneficial to the country, beneficial to all the people, and beneficial to the vast number of peasants.
    Gradually transforming the small-scale peasant economy means gradually changing the relations of production of hundreds of millions of peasants, and its essence is to gradually change the ownership of land and other major agricultural means of production, from the individual ownership of the working peasants to the socialist collective ownership. Lenin said, "We have millions of individual peasant households scattered in all the poor villages. It would be completely absurd to try to transform them from the outside, from the side, by some rapid method, some order. We understand clearly that if we want to influence millions of small-scale peasant economies, we can only adopt gradual and cautious methods, and we can only show them with practical model examples, because peasants are very practical and are very firmly linked to the old-style agriculture, and it is not enough to rely on advice and book knowledge to make them make some serious changes." ("Speech at the First Congress of Agricultural Communes and Agricultural Labor Associations") Chairman Mao also said that mutual aid and cooperation organizations "must be voluntarily participated in by the masses (and must not be forced)." "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, synthesize their experiences, and turn them into better, more orderly principles and methods, and then tell the masses (propaganda), and call on the masses to implement them, solve the problems of the masses, and liberate and make the masses happy." According to Lenin's thought and Chairman Mao's instructions, in the work of transforming the small-scale peasant economy, our Communist Party members must go deep among the peasant masses, carry out persuasive education to the peasant masses, make the peasants understand the benefits of taking the socialist road and national industrialization for themselves, and that it is the "only way" for them to get rid of poverty forever; and lead the way in running a group of typical agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, which is also the most practical and effective education for the peasants, so that the peasants consciously and voluntarily participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and gradually transition to socialism. It is not possible to force the masses to organize subjectively. On the other hand, when the masses have a certain degree of awareness, see the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and spontaneously organize, if we adopt a subjective attitude, do not recognize it, do not lead it and gradually improve it, or even forcibly order it to be disbanded, that is also wrong. Chairman Mao pointed out ten years ago: "No matter what the name is, no matter how many people are in each unit, whether it is a few people, dozens of people, or hundreds of people, and whether it is composed entirely of full labor force, or with the participation of semi-labor force, and whether the mutual aid is human power, animal power, tools, or even collective eating and lodging during busy farming seasons, and whether it is temporary or permanent, in short, as long as it is a collective mutual aid organization voluntarily participated in by the masses (and must not be forced), it is good." We must follow this instruction, go deep among the peasant masses, summarize the creations and experiences of the masses, adopt all the methods and forms that have been proven effective by the masses, step by step strengthen education, improve it, and guide the peasants all the way to socialism. Never limit ourselves to one experience, one specification, one model that is applied everywhere. Lenin said: "...adopt the methods that are as simple, easy, and convenient for the peasants as possible to accept to transition to the new system," "use fewer clever methods and fewer ingenious tricks." ("On Cooperation") This is completely in line with the actual situation of the lower cultural level in China's rural areas at present, and is what we must pay close attention to in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the final analysis, that is to say, when gradually changing the relations of production of hundreds of millions of peasants who are engaged in small-scale production, and gradually changing the individual ownership of the working peasants, we must never adopt crude methods, forced orders, let alone confiscate the feudal exploitative land ownership of the landlord class as in the land reform, to deprive the small and medium producers in the countryside, nor can we rely on a single order to achieve it. We must always think of the masses, consider for the masses, act according to the masses' free will, and thereby educate the masses and gradually improve the masses. Just as Chairman Mao often tells us: subjectivism is not allowed at any time, and commandism is not allowed at any time. As long as we get rid of subjectivism and commandism, and follow the road of transforming the small-scale peasant economy through cooperatives as instructed by Chairman Mao, actively lead, and move forward steadily, then the historical task of socialist transformation of agriculture in the transition period will surely be gradually realized and successfully completed. The truth of organizing and mutual aid and cooperation, as instructed by Chairman Mao ten years ago, led the people to develop production, overcome difficulties, and achieve victory in the past revolutionary war period; in the current transition period, it also shines like a lighthouse on all the peasants, guiding them to transition together to the national socialist era.

    组织起来，发展农业的互助合作，逐步过渡到社会主义
    ——纪念“组织起来”发表十周年
  　廖鲁言
    一九四三年十一月二十九日，毛主席在招待陕甘宁边区劳动英雄的大会上做了一篇有关农业生产发展方向的有历史意义的演讲。毛主席指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”
    在最困难的敌后抗日战争中，以及在其后反蒋反美的人民解放战争中，当时的陕甘宁边区和其他各解放区的农民，在经过减租减息、合理负担和平分土地这一些不同形式与不同程度的土地改革的基础上，遵照毛主席这一英明的指示，“组织成为一支劳动大军”，发挥了集体劳动的优越性，一般地两个人可以抵三个人用，大大地提高了农业的劳动生产率。在这些困难的时期和进行伟大战斗的日子，毛主席这个号召对于克服解放区经济财政的困难，战胜国内外敌人的经济封锁，把农业生产推向前进，起了很巨大的作用。毛主席对当时的互助组、变工队，给以极高的估价。他认为这种生产合作虽然“生产工具根本没变化，生产的成果也不是归公而是归私的，但人与人的生产关系变化了：这是生产制度上的革命，这是第二个革命”。（“一九四二年在陕甘宁边区高干会上的讲话”）
    人民革命在全国胜利以后，农业生产上的互助合作，在土地改革胜利完成的基础上，无论在老解放区和晚解放区都有了发展。虽然有的地方，由于土地改革刚刚结束，曾有一度未积极宣传互助合作；或者由于对毛主席所指示的，经过合作社逐渐集体化是克服分散的个体经济的唯一办法这一真理，体会不深，甚至忽视，而一度对互助合作采取放任自流的态度。但是在一九五一年冬季，党中央作出了关于农业生产互助合作的决议以后，这些情况就随即改变了。两年以来，互助合作运动在全国各地有了更大更好的发展。我国农业生产能在一九五二年达到并且超过抗日战争前的水平，这固然由于各方面工作的配合，但必须了解互助合作运动的发展是一项重要的因素。根据今年十月的统计，在生产上组织在临时互助组、常年互助组和农业生产合作社里面的农民已达四千七百余万户，占全国农村总户数的百分之四十以上，在农业户口中所占的比例则更高。以土地入股和统一经营为特点的半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，现已有一万四千多个。由具有社会主义性质的萌芽的互助组，到半社会主义的农业生产合作社，再到更高级的完全社会主义的农业生产合作社（也就是集体农庄），这一条逐步改造小农经济，逐步过渡到社会主义的具体道路，已经成为许多农民群众（特别是老解放区的农民群众）所理解，所接受，所实践的纲领和任务。他们已经从实践中懂得，这是他们自身经济发展所必须经历的道路，是高度发展农业生产，从而高度提高他们自身的生活所必须经历的道路。
    不仅在农业生产方面有了群众规模的互助合作运动，而且在对农民的生产生活资料的供应和农副产品的推销方面，供销合作社也已成为一个全国性的新型的商业网，它拥有三万二千个基层社和一万万以上的社员，分布在全国的农村中。此外，还采取了信用小组、信用合作社和供销合作社信用部等组织形式，初步开展了农村中的信用合作。农业生产合作、农村供销合作和农村信用合作，三者结合起来，相互推动，共同发展，无疑将逐步实现农村的合作化。毛主席说，有了这种种合作社，“我们就可以把群众的力量组织成为一支劳动大军。这是人民群众得到解放的必由之路，由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。
    我们国家的计划经济建设已经开始了，农业个体经济的分散性跟国家经济的计划性是不相适应的。工业发展了，就要求农业有相应的发展，要求大量增产粮食、棉花及其他原料作物；而个体经济的农业，增产是有限的，不能适应国家工业化的需要，也不能适应人民生活不断提高的需要。过渡时期的总路线和总任务之一就是对农业实行社会主义改造，逐步把全体农民引导到集体生产大家富裕的社会主义。这是一个克服个体经济与集体经济的矛盾的过程。个体经济时刻滋生着资本主义的因素，这种资本主义的自发势力，如任其自由泛滥，结果将是极少数人靠剥削而发财，变成富农，绝大多数农民被剥削而赤贫破产。如果我们安于个体小农经济的现状，而不积极引导农民走上组织起来，互助合作，逐步过渡到社会主义这一条光明大道，那末，农村的两极分化就会大大发展起来。这就是说，社会主义不去占领农村阵地，资本主义必去占领；其结果就是妨碍农业生产的发展，造成农业与工业之间的发展不平衡，从而破坏计划经济建设，破坏国家的社会主义工业化，也从而使广大农民失掉其在土地改革中所得到的果实，重新陷入破产穷困，生活极其痛苦的境地。这是害了国家，害了全体人民，害了广大农民。毛主席在十年前给中国农民指出的组织起来，互助合作的道路，在目前的过渡时期中，成为实现我们国家的总路线和总任务，改造个体农业经济的具体道路。遵循着这条光明大道前进，就一定能够大大地提高农业生产，逐步增加农业生产的计划性，战胜农村中的资本主义自发势力，从而保证国家的计划经济建设，支援社会主义工业化，也从而保证广大农民的物质文化生活的不断提高；这既有利于国家，也有利于全体人民，有利于广大农民。
    逐步改造小农经济，就是逐步改变几万万农民的生产关系，其实质就是逐步改变土地及其他主要的农业生产资料的所有制，从劳动农民的个人所有制改变为社会主义的集体所有制。列宁说，“我国有千百万分散于各穷乡僻壤的个体农户。要想用某种急速办法，某种命令来从外面，从旁边去强迫加以改造，那都是完全荒谬的思想。我们明白懂得，要想影响千百万小农经济，只能采取逐渐的谨慎的办法，只能用实际模范例子来表明，因为农民非常讲求实际，又与旧式农业联结得非常巩固，要使他们作某种严重的改变，单靠忠告和书本知识是不行的”。（“在农业公社和农业劳动组合第一次代表大会上的演说”）毛主席也说，互助合作组织“要是群众自愿参加（决不能强迫）”。“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福”。根据列宁的思想和毛主席的指示，在改造小农经济工作中，我们共产党员就必须深入到农民群众中去，向农民群众进行说服教育，使农民懂得走社会主义道路和国家工业化对他们自己的好处，是他们自己永远摆脱贫困的“唯一办法”；并且有领导地办好一批典型的农业生产合作社和互助组，这也就是对农民最实际最有效的教育，从而使农民自觉自愿地参加到互助合作组织中来，逐步过渡到社会主义。主观主义地强迫群众组织起来，是不行的。另一方面，当群众有了一定的觉悟，看到互助合作组织的优越性而自发地组织起来，如果我们采取主观主义的态度，不予承认，不去领导它和逐步提高它，甚至强迫命令加以解散，那也是错误的。毛主席在十年以前就指出：“无论叫什么名称，无论每一单位的人数是几个人的，几十个人的，几百个人的，又无论单是由全劳动力组成的，或有半劳动力参加的，又无论实行互助的是人力、畜力、工具，或者在农忙时竟至集体吃饭住宿，也无论是临时性的，还是永久性的，总之，只要是群众自愿参加（决不能强迫）的集体互助组织，就是好的”。我们必须按照这一指示，深入农民群众，总结群众的创造和经验，采用群众业已行之有效的一切办法和形式，一步一步地加强教育，予以提高，把农民一直引导到社会主义。绝不要限定于一种经验，一种规格，一个模子到处套。列宁说：“……采用对农民尽量简单，容易和便于接受的办法过渡到新制度方面来”，“少用些高明办法，少来些巧妙的花样。”（“论合作制”）这完全合乎目前中国农村文化水平较低的实际情况，是我们在互助合作运动中必须切实注意的。归根结底，就是说，在逐步改变几万万分散的小生产的农民的生产关系的时候，逐步改变劳动农民的个人所有制的时候，绝不能采取粗暴的方法，强迫命令的方法，更不能像土地改革中没收地主阶级的封建剥削的土地所有制一样，去剥夺农村的中小生产者，也不能靠一声号令的办法来实现，必须处处想到群众，为群众打算，依据群众的自愿办事，又从而教育群众，一步一步地提高群众。正如毛主席经常告诉我们的：主观主义在任何时候都是不允许的，命令主义在任何时候也是不允许的。只要我们去掉主观主义，又去掉命令主义，遵循着毛主席所指示的经过合作社来改造小农经济的道路，积极领导，稳步前进，那末，在过渡时期中对农业的社会主义改造的历史任务就一定能够逐步实现，胜利完成。毛主席在十年前所指示的组织起来，互助合作这一真理，在过去的革命战争时期领导人民发展了生产，克服了困难，取得了胜利；在目前的过渡时期中也像灯塔一样，照耀着全体农民，引导他们一齐过渡到全国的社会主义时代。
