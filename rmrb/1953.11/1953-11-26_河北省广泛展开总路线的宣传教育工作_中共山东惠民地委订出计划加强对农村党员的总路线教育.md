Hebei Province is widely launching propaganda and education work regarding the general line of the transition period. Since mid-November, more than 150 counties and towns across the province have successively convened winter work conferences for cadres at the county, district, and township levels to convey the general line. In addition, each county has selected a key township, combined with grain purchase work, to vigorously carry out propaganda and education of the general line to the broad masses of peasants. In total, more than 300,000 people across the province have heard reports on the general line.

Since September, Lin Tie, Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, has conveyed the Party's general line for the transition period at various meetings held by provincial-level agencies. Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the Provincial Committee, also made the same report at the provincial people's armed forces conference. In late October, Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the enlarged cadre meeting of provinces, districts, and counties held in Baoding, Hebei Province, and gave a report on the general line and general tasks to the cadres attending the meeting and cadres of provincial-level agencies. In early November, Liu Lantao and Lin Tie also went to Shijiazhuang City to deliver reports on the general line to cadres of municipal and special district agencies and local troops. Ma Guorui conveyed the general line to cadres at the county, district, and township levels in Mancheng County. Responsible cadres of government agencies at all levels in Hebei Province have also been making reports on the general line to their subordinate cadres and staff since the beginning of November. At present, special districts, cities, counties, towns, and townships are conducting the conveyance level by level.

After hearing the reports on the Party's general line for the transition period, cadres in various places were jubilant and unanimously expressed their warm support. For example, Li Juding, Deputy Secretary of the Eighth District Committee of Wu'an County, said, "Before, I didn't have a clear understanding of my work. I just did whatever the leadership told me to do. After hearing the report on the general line, my mind is much clearer." Jia Jinzhong, Deputy Township Head of Guanxiang Township in Anxin County, said after hearing the report on the general line: "In the past, I always only thought about individual wealth. In the future, we must pursue socialist wealth, so that everyone can become rich. I will sell 5,000 catties of rice to the state." Zhang Qingxiu, a cooperative member in Wu'an County, voluntarily reported her family's surplus grain and decided to sell it all to the state. Sun J桂, a cadre in Shoulingshan Village, Mancheng County, said in the discussion: "We didn't know the importance of getting organized in the past. Now that we know the general line, we can recognize the bright path." Zhang Xuezhuang, a township cadre in Anguo County and director of an agricultural production cooperative, said very happily: "In the past, I didn't know how to get to a socialist society. Now that I've heard the report, I understand that we are on the right path." Wu Luoguo, Secretary of the Dongxiantai Township Party Branch in Mancheng County, said solemnly at the conference: "I have made a mistake by withdrawing from the cooperative. I am determined to make a self-criticism to all Party members and cooperative members, rejoin the cooperative, and organize the masses to establish another agricultural production cooperative to resolutely lead the peasants on the road to prosperity for everyone." During the discussion on supporting national industrialization, Changli County organized a photo exhibition of Soviet industrialization and screened the Soviet film "Happy Life," explaining that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, which greatly educated the cadres. The cadres unanimously realized that only when the country is industrialized and tractors are manufactured can the peasants truly escape poverty and their lives be fundamentally improved. Most of the cadres in Houjiapu Township, Yutian County, were poor peasants in the past, but now their lives have improved a lot. Guiding them to recall the past and compare it with the present, they all realize that if it weren't for the state's loans and support and the supply of industrial products, waterwheels, and walking plows, their lives would not have improved so quickly. They unanimously expressed their willingness to sell their surplus grain to the state. During the enlarged cadre meeting in Changli County, when discussing selling surplus grain to the state, many people recalled the situation where private merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. Someone said: "When grain prices rise, commodity prices also rise. The ones who suffer are still us farmers, and only private merchants benefit." Zhao Jingxiang, a cadre in Wanzhuang Township, Baixiang County, said: In 1950, I saved 1,200 catties of cotton, hoping to wait for a high price, but I didn't sell it. If I had sold it at that time and invested it in production, how much more income would I have earned in the past few years!

After such study, cadres at all levels are now going to the countryside in batches, and all Party members are leading Youth League members and non-Party activists to form a strong propaganda force to conduct propaganda on the general line to all the people.

Furthermore, in order to strengthen the general line education for rural branch Party members, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Huimin Prefectural Committee of Shandong Province has formulated a training plan for rural branch committee members and branch instructors, requiring each county to use the slack winter season to train 3,100 rural branch committee members and branch instructors. The training time is 20 days to one month (from mid-November to mid-December). The training content is mainly focused on the education of implementing the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, combined with relevant basic knowledge education of the Party. Through this education, everyone will generally understand the basic spirit and significance of the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period; understand the prospects of national socialist industrialization, strengthen their confidence and determination to strive for the gradual realization of socialism, and powerfully promote the smooth development of the current increase production and practice economy movement and grain purchase and other work; clarify the importance of agricultural production and its principles, policies, and lines, establish the idea of long-term leadership of agricultural production, rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and make ideological and organizational preparations for carrying out agricultural production increase and mutual aid and cooperation movement next year, correct and overcome the phenomenon of some Party and Youth League members being uneasy about agricultural production and capitalist ideological tendencies; clearly understand the important significance and policies of grain purchase work, improve students' understanding, eliminate various ideological obstacles, and actively mobilize and organize the broad masses of Party members and masses to respond to the call of the Party and the government, sell surplus grain to the state, and complete the grain purchase task. The plan requires that the county committees of each county strengthen their leadership over the training work, and the responsible comrades of the county committees should personally make reports. During the training period, the county committees should assign special personnel to be responsible for regularly checking and discussing the training work. If the training institutions are not sound, they should be quickly strengthened according to the original establishment.

    河北省广泛展开总路线的宣传教育工作
    中共山东惠民地委订出计划加强对农村党员的总路线教育
    河北省各地广泛展开关于国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育工作。从十一月中旬起，全省已有一百五十多个县、镇先后召开了县、区、乡三级干部冬季工作会议，传达了总路线。另外，各县选择了一个重点乡，结合购粮工作，开始对广大农民群众大张旗鼓地展开总路线的宣传教育。总计全省听到总路线报告的已达三十多万人。
    从九月份以来，中共河北省委书记林铁，在省一级机关召开的各种会议上传达了党在过渡时期的总路线，省委第二书记马国瑞也在省人民武装会议上作了同样的报告。十月下旬，中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛到保定参加河北省召开的省、区、县扩大干部会议，并向出席会议的干部和省级各机关干部做了关于总路线总任务的报告。十一月上旬，刘澜涛和林铁还到石家庄市，向市及专区各机关干部和当地部队作了关于总路线的传达报告。马国瑞向满城县县、区、乡三级干部传达了总路线。河北省各地各级政府机关的负责干部，从十一月初起，也都向所属干部、工作人员作了总路线的传达报告。现各专区、市、县、镇、乡正在逐级进行传达中。
    各地干部在听了党在过渡时期的总路线的传达报告后，欢欣鼓舞，一致表示热烈拥护。如武安县八区区委副书记李聚鼎说：“以前工作没底，领导方面叫干啥就干啥，这次听了总路线的传达报告，心眼里亮堂多了。”安新县关城乡副乡长贾进忠听了总路线的传达报告后说：“过去，总是光想个人富，今后要过社会主义的大富，要大家都富。我要把五千斤稻子卖给国家。”武安县合作社张青秀，自动报告了家中的余粮，决定全部卖给国家。满城县守陵村干部孙金桂在讨论中说：“我们过去不知道组织起来的重要，现在知道了总路线，可认清了光明大道了。”安国县乡干部张学壮是农业生产合作社主任，他十分愉快地说：“过去不知道怎么走才能到社会主义社会，现在听了报告，明白我们走对道了。”满城县东贤台乡党支部书记吴洛国在大会上沉痛地说：“我已做错了，退了社。回去决心向全体党员和社员作检讨，重新入社，并组织群众再建立一个农业生产合作社，坚决领导农民走大家都富裕的道路。”在讨论支持国家工业化问题时，昌黎县在会上组织了苏联工业化图片展览，还放映了苏联电影“幸福的生活”，并说明苏联的今天就是我们的明天，给干部们的教育很大。干部们一致认识了只有国家工业化了，制造出拖拉机，农民才能真正脱离贫困，生活才能得到根本改善。玉田县候家铺乡的干部，过去大多是贫苦农民，现在生活都提高了很多，引导他们回忆过去，比比现在，都认识到要不是国家贷款扶植和供应工业品、水车、步犁，生活决不会提高的这么快。他们一致表示要把余粮卖给国家。昌黎县扩大干部会上讨论把余粮卖给国家时，许多人回忆起私商趁机抬价的情况。有人说：“粮价一涨，物价也涨，吃亏的还是咱们庄稼人，只有私商沾大光。”柏乡县万庄乡干部赵景祥说：一九五○年我存了一千二百斤棉花，想等大价，没卖。要是当时卖了投资到生产上，这几年可得增加多大收入呀！
    经过这样学习后，各级干部正分批下乡和所有党员带动团员、非党积极分子组成一个强大宣传力量，向全体人民进行总路线的宣传。
    又讯：为了加强对农村支部党员的总路线教育，中共山东惠民地委宣传部订出了乡村支部委员和支部教员的训练计划，要求各县利用农事冬闲季节，训练乡村支部委员和支部教员三千一百人。训练时间为二十天至一个月（从十一月中旬开始到十二月中旬结束）。训练内容是以贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线总任务教育为主，结合进行有关党的基础知识教育。通过这次教育，使大家大体了解党在过渡时期的总路线总任务的基本精神和意义；了解国家社会主义工业化的前途，加强为逐步实现社会主义而奋斗的信心和决心，有力地推动当前增产节约运动和购粮等工作的顺利开展；弄清农业生产的重要性及其方针、政策和路线，树立长期领导农业生产的思想，整顿好互助合作组织，为明年开展农业增产和互助合作运动作好思想准备和组织准备，纠正和克服某些党、团员不安心农业生产的现象以及资本主义思想倾向；明确认识购粮工作的重要意义和政策，提高学员认识，扫除各种思想障碍，积极动员与组织广大党员、群众响应党和政府的号召，把余粮卖给国家，完成购粮任务。该计划要求各县县委加强对训练工作的领导，由县委负责同志亲自作报告。在训练期间，县委要有专人负责定期检查、讨论训练工作，训练机构不健全的，应按着原来编制迅速充实起来。
