    Livelihood Cooperative Credit Department of Liuhe Village, Suihua County
    Adopts Various Credit Methods to Support Production
    The Credit Department of the Livelihood Cooperative of Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, maintains close contact with farmers and adopts various credit methods to solve production difficulties, which has enlivened the rural economy. There are 153 households in Liuhe Village, and 95% of the total households have credit relations with the department. The Credit Department regularly has grain funds worth 30 million to 50 million yuan deposited by farmers. Depositors can deposit cash, grain, or various agricultural tools and local products. Primary school students can deposit a liter of grain accumulated from gleaning crops. Farmer Pan Xuewan is a person who deposits any spare money he has into the Credit Department. In one year, he accumulated 1.8 million yuan and bought a horse. During summer hoeing, a horse in Pan Xuefu's mutual aid team suffered from glanders, which affected production. The department immediately lent them 1 million yuan, and they bought another horse, solving the difficulties in production. Since the spring plowing, the department has helped the masses buy 13 horses and 5 cattle, and lent a total of 7,200 catties of soybean and wheat seeds. After the autumn harvest began, the department also adopted various flexible and simple methods to purchase grain from farmers, expand the scope of credit, and prepare conditions for winter sideline production and next year's spring plowing.

    绥化县六合村供销合作社信贷部
    采用各种信贷办法扶助生产
    黑龙江省绥化县六合村供销社信贷部，密切联系农民，采用多种信贷办法解决生产困难，活跃了农村经济。六合村共一百五十三户，同该部发生信贷关系的占总户数百分之九十五。信贷部经常有农民存入值三千万元至五千万元的粮款。存款的人可以存现金、粮食，或者各种农具和土产品。小学生可以把拣庄稼积累的一升粮食拿来作价存款。农民潘学宽是一个一有零钱就存到信贷部去的人，一年的工夫，他积累了一百八十万元，买了一匹马。夏锄时潘学富互助组一匹马害了鼻疽病，影响生产。该部立刻贷给他们一百万元，又买来一匹马，解决了生产中的困难。自春耕以来，该部帮助群众买进十三匹马，五头牛，并贷出豆种麦种共七千二百斤。秋收开始以后该部还采用各种灵活、简便的方法收购农民粮食，扩大信贷范围，为冬季副业生产和明年春耕准备条件。　（方青）
