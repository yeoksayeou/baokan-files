Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 4th: Since the commencement of the explanation work, the U.S. side's so-called "representatives" and "translators" have been constantly disrupting the explanation tents, violating the explanation rules, and openly intimidating prisoners of war, attempting to deepen the prisoners' fears and prevent them from requesting repatriation. On November 3rd, the U.S. side continued to employ these shameless tactics in the explanation work. In Explanation Tent No. 17, after the U.S. side's so-called "detaining side representative" gestured to a prisoner of war, the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary body immediately warned this U.S. "representative," as pointed out by our explanation representative. However, a translator from the Syngman Rhee gang cursed the chairman as a "son of a bitch." When the chairman questioned who he was cursing, he put on his coat, walked to the table of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary body, pointed at the chairman and shouted, "I'm cursing you!" Then he strode out of the tent. This disruptive behavior by the U.S. side interrupted the explanation work for more than twenty minutes. Later, this Syngman Rhee agent brazenly denied it, saying he was "talking to himself," and the U.S. "detaining party representative" even tried to get him back into the tent. This attempt was rejected by the chairman of the subsidiary body.

In Explanation Tent No. 30, a prisoner of war was listening to the explanation with a fearful attitude, uttering "I don't believe you" reluctantly once or twice. But later his voice became lower and lower, and he kept glancing at the door for those applying for repatriation. At this moment, the U.S. "representative" suddenly flicked his cigarette towards the door for those not applying for repatriation, crossed his arms, glared at the prisoner of war, and pointed at the door for those not applying for repatriation with his pen, making various gestures, scaring the prisoner so much that sweat streamed down his face.

The explanation process shows that many prisoners of war harbor extremely serious fears and concerns due to two or three years of terror in the POW camps and the deception and threats of special agents. In Explanation Tent No. 22, a prisoner of war was stomping his feet and making a commotion as soon as he entered. However, when he turned around and saw that an observation representative from the Korean and Chinese side was an acquaintance of his, he suddenly calmed down, lowered his head, and said, "I know him, he used to be my platoon leader." He then stopped talking, his face flushed, scratching his scalp, and repeatedly trying to tear off the reactionary slogan wrapped around his hat. At this time, the explanation representative from the Korean and Chinese side encouraged him not to be afraid of the special agents any longer, to break through the doubts created by the special agents' deception, and to boldly return to the embrace of the Republic. After waiting quietly for fifteen minutes, he suddenly tore off the reactionary slogan and threw it on the ground, raised his head, and said loudly, "I want to return to the Republic!" The U.S. "observation representative" saw this situation and attempted to threaten the prisoner of war. He openly violated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" by interjecting, "This prisoner of war had indicated that he did not want to be repatriated when he entered the tent." However, the chairman of the subsidiary body replied, "Yes, but he now requests repatriation." As a result, the prisoner of war walked out of the door for those applying for repatriation with a sense of relief.

### 解释帐篷中美方“代表”和“翻译”的丑态

    解释帐篷中美方“代表”和“翻译”的丑态
    【新华社开城四日电】自从解释工作进行以来，美方的所谓“代表”和“翻译”，不断在解释帐篷中进行捣乱，破坏解释规则，公然恫吓战俘，企图加深战俘的疑惧心理，使他们不敢要求遣返。在十一月三日的解释工作中，美方继续施用这种无耻的手段。在第十七号解释帐篷中，由于美方的所谓“拘留方代表”对一个战俘举手示意，经我方解释代表指出，中立国遣返委员会附属机构的主席当即警告了这名美方“代表”。而一个李承晚匪帮翻译竟骂主席是“婊子养的”。主席质问他骂谁，他穿好大衣，走到中立国遣返委员会附属机构桌子面前，指着主席叫道：“我骂你！”然后就扬长走出了帐篷。美方这一捣乱行为，使解释工作中断了二十多分钟。后来这个李承晚特务又厚颜抵赖说是“对自己说的”，而美国“拘留一方代表”居然还想把他弄进帐篷来。这一企图遭到了附属机构主席的拒绝。
    在第三十号解释帐篷中，有一名战俘一面怀着疑惧的情绪在听解释，一面勉勉强强地讲一两声“我不相信你”，可是后来声音越来越小了，不时向申请遣返的门偷看，这时美方的“代表”突然把手里的纸烟向未申请遣返的门口一甩，两臂一抱，鼓着眼睛瞪着战俘，同时用钢笔指着未申请遣返的门，用手做出各种表示，吓得那个战俘汗珠从头上直往下淌。
    解释过程表明：许多战俘由于两三年的恐怖的战俘生活和特务的欺骗威胁，怀着极端严重的恐怖心理和顾虑。在第二十二号解释帐篷，有一个战俘一进来就顿脚吵闹，可是他一回头望见帐篷外面有一位朝中方面的观察代表是他的熟人，他忽然安静下来，低着头说：“我认识他，他过去是我的排长。”他接着就不说话，涨红着脸，用手抓头皮，几次想要把围在帽子上的反动标语拉下来。这时，朝中方面的解释代表鼓励他不要再害怕特务，打破特务欺骗所造成的疑虑，大胆回到共和国的怀抱。这样静静地等了十五分钟，最后，他一下把反动标语拉掉扔在地上，抬起头来，大声说：“我要回共和国！”美方的“观察代表”看到这种情形，还企图对战俘进行威胁。他公然违反“解释和访问工作细则”，插进来说：“这个战俘进帐篷时已表示不愿遣返了。”可是附属机构主席回答他说：“是的，可是他现在要求遣返了。”于是，这个战俘才如释重负一般从申请遣返的门走出来。
