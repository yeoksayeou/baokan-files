The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction department, in the production increase and economy drive, in addition to focusing on improving quality and accelerating progress, is also practicing strict economy and reducing project costs. According to preliminary statistics from various construction companies, the savings this time will amount to 78.3 billion yuan.

The Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction department began cost reduction by addressing material waste, as material costs are a major part of project expenses. The Basic Construction Materials Department, based on the actual needs of the projects, carefully revised the material supply plan for the fourth quarter during this production increase and economy drive, reducing the state material allocation by 30 billion yuan while ensuring supply and quality. At the same time, the Materials Department assigned some cadres to handle the large amount of stagnant materials accumulated in the past. Through this work, they strive to ensure that 100 billion yuan of funds will no longer be tied up and wasted within the year.

In addition, under the premise of absolutely not affecting project quality, they also vigorously process and utilize waste materials. In addition to processing a batch of waste materials worth 7 billion yuan, they recovered and dismantled 3,000 tons of scrap steel and iron after the completion of major projects such as the large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant. They also saved a lot of funds by utilizing old materials. For example, the Metal Structure Engineering Company used 3,500 tons of old steel, saving 4 billion yuan. The Furnace Construction Engineering Company and the cement mixing plant saved 2.2 billion yuan by using old refractory materials and spare parts. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Civil Construction Company had about 3,000 cubic meters of waste wood left over from projects. These woods varied in length, thickness, and uneven edges, with many nail holes, and had been piled up without use. This time, the comrades of the timber group of the supply section of the Civil Construction Company made two small circular saws to collect these materials and sort them out separately for modification. Large pieces were converted into tile strips and floor battens for use in formal projects; small pieces of wood and board edges were sawn into boards for miscellaneous projects (such as making wardrobes, bowl cabinets, rice cabinets, etc.). Even the remaining sawdust was used in cold-proof projects. As a result, there was no loss, and it is estimated that more than 3 billion yuan of funds were saved. The Anshan Iron and Steel Basic Construction Materials Department, through the disposal of old materials, guarantees an annual savings of 12 billion yuan and strives to reach 20 billion yuan.

The Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction department is also working hard to save other project expenses, especially transportation costs. In the past, Anshan Iron and Steel wasted a lot in this area. For example, one item of equipment and materials of the Mechanical Installation Company was moved back and forth seven times, wasting a lot of money and time; the phenomenon of trucks running empty with light loads was also very common. During this production increase and economy drive, the transportation department took some measures to overcome this waste. For example, the Pipeline Engineering Company stipulates that materials should be delivered directly to the construction site; prohibits random handling on site; and requires trucks to transport materials according to their actual load capacity, which saves 250 million yuan in transportation costs. In addition, strengthening the dispatching of transportation work has saved the Mechanical Installation Company 470 million yuan. The result of strengthening transportation work is not only saving a lot of transportation costs, but also greatly improving transportation efficiency and improving the order of the construction site.

The Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction department is also working hard to save miscellaneous expenses and other expenses. The Metal Structure Company implemented quota management of expenses, and the cost in September was greatly reduced. The Electrical Installation Company estimates that it can save 500 million yuan in miscellaneous expenses throughout the year.

In the work of practicing strict economy and reducing project costs, the Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction department mobilized the masses to carry out rationalization proposals and promote advanced experience, which played a great role in saving. For example, a rationalization proposal of the Civil Construction Engineering Department to fill the core of the wall with broken bricks saved 150,000 bricks in the design building project; the Civil Construction Company's suggestion to replace flat iron with cast iron for building railings saved 600 million yuan; according to statistics, so far, various rationalization proposals have saved a total of 5 billion yuan. Many units vigorously promote advanced experience and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts to ensure quality, strive to overfulfill the workload, and accelerate the progress of the project. The Geological Department expects that according to this year's original investment plan, it will overfulfill a number of trenching, sampling, drilling, and pit exploration tasks, which can save a total of 12.5 billion yuan; many projects were completed ahead of schedule in the production increase and economy competition, thus saving a lot of winter construction costs.

    鞍钢基本建设部门大力降低工程成本
    初步统计将节约资金七百八十三亿元
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门在增产节约运动中，除了以提高质量和加速进度作为主要内容外，同时并厉行节约，降低工程成本。据各工程公司的初步统计，这次节约可达资金七百八十三亿元。
    鞍钢基本建设部门降低成本首先从克服材料浪费入手，因为材料费是工程费用中的主要部分。基本建设材料处根据工程的实际需要，在这次增产节约运动中再次审慎地修订了第四季度的材料供应计划，在保证供应、保证质量的原则下，削减了国家材料拨款三百亿元。同时，材料处抽了一些干部处理过去积压下来的大批呆滞材料，通过这次工作，争取在年内使一千亿元的资金不再被积压和浪费。
    此外，在绝对不影响工程质量的前提下，他们还大力地处理并利用废旧材料。除已处理了一批价值七十亿元的废旧材料外，在大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂等主要工程竣工后，他们回收和拆除了废钢废铁三千吨。在利用旧材料方面，他们也节省了许多资金。如金属结构工程公司利用了旧钢材三千五百吨，节约了四十亿元。筑炉工程公司和洋灰搅拌厂利用旧的耐火材料和备品，也节约了二十二亿元。又如鞍钢土木建筑公司有工程中剩下的废木料约三千立方公尺，这些木材长短厚薄不一，棱角不整，钉眼又多，一直被乱堆着没有使用，这次土木建筑公司供应科木材组的同志做了两台小圆锯，将这些材料搜集起来分别加以整理改制，大的改为瓦条子、地楞等，用到正式工程上；小木材和板边锯成板材，给杂项工程用（如制壁橱、碗箱、米柜等），连剩下的锯末都用到防寒工程上，结果一点损耗也没有，估计共节省了三十余亿元资金。鞍钢基本建设材料处通过旧材料的处理，保证全年可节约一百二十亿元，争取达到二百亿元。
    鞍钢基本建设部门还努力节约其他工程费用，特别是运输费用。过去鞍钢这方面的浪费不少，如机械安装公司有一项设备材料曾来回搬动了七次，浪费了很多钱和时间；车子少载空跑现象也很普遍。这次增产节约运动中，运输部门采取了一些措施克服这种浪费，如管道工程公司规定材料要直送工地；禁止现场随便搬运；车子要按实际载重能力进行运料等，就节约了运费二亿五千万元。另外并加强运输的调度工作，机械安装公司因此就节约了四亿七千万元。加强运输工作的结果，不仅节省了大量运输费用，并大大提高了运输效率，改进了工地的秩序。
    鞍钢基本建设部门也努力节约杂费和节约其他各项开支。金属结构公司实行费用限额管理，九月份的成本大大降低。电气安装公司预算全年可节约杂费五亿元。
    在厉行节约降低工程成本的工作中，鞍钢基本建设部门发动群众，开展了合理化建议和推广先进经验的工作，对节约起了极大作用。如土木建筑工程处以碎砖填墙心的一项合理化建议，在设计大楼的工程中就节约了红砖十五万块；土木建筑公司楼台栏杆以铸铁代替扁铁的建议，节约了六亿元；据统计，到目前为止，各项合理化建议共节约了资金五十亿元。许多单位大力推广先进经验，贯彻苏联专家的建议，以保证质量，争取超额完成工作量和加速工程进度。地质处预计按今年原有投资计划，将超额完成若干槽探、采样、钻探、坑探任务，共可节约一百二十五亿元；许多工程在增产节约竞赛中提前竣工，因而节省了冬季施工的许多费用。
