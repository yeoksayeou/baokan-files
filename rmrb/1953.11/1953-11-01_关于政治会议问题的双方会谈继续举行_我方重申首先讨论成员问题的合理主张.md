Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 31st - The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the Political Conference issued the following communique:

    The sixth meeting on the Political Conference between the two sides was held on October 31st.

    The US representative, Mr. Dean, today again used the excuse that the two sides could conduct discussions according to a so-called flexible and unfixed order of agenda, and continued to reject our side's reasonable agenda of first discussing and resolving the issue of the composition of the Political Conference and then resolving other issues.

    Mr. Ki Sok-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, immediately pointed out that the other side's proposal contained nothing new, and was merely a tactic to continue opposing the discussion and resolution of the issue of the composition of the Political Conference first. Mr. Ki Sok-bok solemnly pointed out again that the agenda proposed by our side included all issues related to the Political Conference that should be resolved. The issue of the composition is not only related to the success or failure of the Political Conference, but also only when the issue of composition is resolved can other issues related to the Political Conference be properly resolved. Therefore, our side's agenda of listing the issue of the composition of the Political Conference as the first item on the agenda is completely reasonable. Mr. Ki Sok-bok refuted the other side's so-called argument of discussing easier issues first, saying that it is only because the other side insists on its unreasonable position and refuses to negotiate a resolution that the issue of the composition of the Political Conference has become a so-called complex issue. And if the issue of the composition of the Political Conference is not resolved first, then the easy issues regarding the time and location of the Political Conference mentioned by the other side will also become complex issues. Therefore, our side completely disagrees with the proposal made by the other side. Mr. Ki Sok-bok again suggested that our side's proposed agenda be adopted and that discussions on the issue of the composition of the Political Conference begin immediately. Finally, in order to give the other side more time to consider our side's opinions, our side suggested an adjournment until Monday (according to the agreement between the two sides, there would be no meeting on Sunday), and the US side agreed to the adjournment.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行
    我方重申首先讨论成员问题的合理主张
    【新华社开城三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十月三十一日双方关于政治会议的会谈举行第六次会议。
    美方代表迪安今日又藉口双方可以按照一个所谓灵活而不定次序的议程进行讨论，继续拒绝我方所提出的首先讨论并解决政治会议成员问题然后解决其他问题的合理议程。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生当即指出对方此种建议并无任何新内容，不过是继续反对首先讨论并解决政治会议成员问题的一种手法。奇石福先生又郑重指出：我方所提的议程包括了一切应予解决的有关政治会议的问题，成员问题不但关系政治会议的成败，而且只有成员问题获得解决，才能适当地解决其他有关政治会议的问题，因此将政治会议的成员问题列为议程第一项的我方议程是完全合理的。奇石福先生对于昨日对方所提出的所谓先谈容易问题的论点加以驳斥说：只是由于对方坚持其无理立场，拒绝协商解决，政治会议的成员问题才成为所谓复杂问题，而如果政治会议的成员问题不首先加以解决，则对方所说的关于政治会议时间地点的容易问题，也将变为复杂的问题，因此对方所提建议，我方完全不能同意。奇石福先生并再次建议通过我方所提出的议程，并立即进入关于政治会议成员问题的讨论。最后为了使对方有更多的时间来考虑我方意见，我方建议休会至星期一（按照双方协议星期日无会），美方同意休会。
