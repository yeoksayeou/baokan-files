    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Renovation Project Accelerated
    First Batch of Products Shipped to Shanghai After Two Blast Furnaces Put into Production
    The renovation project of the blast furnaces at the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has been underway since its official commencement in June this year. Two blast furnaces have been renovated and put into iron production in September and October respectively. A little over two months ago, the wharves along the Yangtze River near the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant were piled high with equipment for renovating the blast furnaces. Now, they are stacked with large quantities of high-quality pig iron. Dockworkers are working diligently from morning till night, and the first batch of pig iron was shipped to Shanghai on October 27th. From now on, the steel and machine manufacturing industries in Shanghai will have a steady supply of pig iron from this very convenient raw material supply base; transportation costs of raw materials will be reduced, and product costs can also be lowered. This creates favorable conditions for increasing production and practicing economy, and supporting national economic construction.
    The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant originally had six blast furnaces, which were severely damaged when Japanese imperialism surrendered. The Kuomintang reactionaries looted the main equipment and valuable parts, leaving only a few dilapidated furnace shells and chimneys. With the planned economic construction of the country, the plant was rebuilt on the ruins. During the renovation project, all unreasonable and unsuitable parts of the old furnaces were dismantled, the hearth and belly of the furnaces were rebuilt, and dozens of hot blast stoves up to eighteen meters high were installed. After the completion of the renovation project, the plant's pig iron production will be greatly increased compared to the period of Japanese puppet rule. The output of the two blast furnaces already producing iron has more than doubled compared to the period of Japanese puppet rule.
    The renovation project of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has received enthusiastic support from workers all over the country. The East China Iron and Steel Company sent ironmaking experts, and steel plants in Taiyuan, Tianjin, Shijingshan, Benxi, and Wuhu sent a large number of workers. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transferred a large number of county and district-level cadres to strengthen the leadership structure. The employees participating in the renovation project, for a common goal—accelerating the industrialization of the motherland—displayed creativity and enthusiasm. In July and August, the local weather was very hot, and the workers were dripping with sweat while working inside the hot blast stoves. The concrete engineering team worked in three shifts day and night, completing the foundation engineering of the hot blast stoves seven and a half days ahead of schedule at the fastest speed.
    Currently, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has entered a period of production and construction simultaneously. The plant's employees are striving to complete the renovation of all blast furnaces and put them into production before the end of the year. (Zhang Zhenguo)

    马鞍山铁厂改建工程加速进行
    两座炼铁炉投入生产后第一批产品已运往上海
    国营马鞍山铁厂改建炼铁炉的工程从今年六月正式施工以来，已有两个炼铁炉改建完成，并于九月和十月间先后出铁。两个多月以前，马鞍山铁厂附近长江码头上还堆放着大批改建炼铁炉的器材，现在那里已堆放着大批品质良好的生铁了。搬运工人们从早到晚紧张地工作着，第一批生铁已于十月二十七日运往上海。从此，上海炼钢工业和机器制造工业就可从这个非常近便的原料供应基地源源得到生铁了；原料运费减低，产品成本也可以降低了，这就为增产节约、支援国家经济建设创造了有利条件。
    马鞍山铁厂原有六座炼铁炉，在日本帝国主义投降时曾遭到严重的破坏，国民党反动派又将主要设备和贵重零件抢劫一空，剩下来的只是几座残缺的炉壳和烟囱。随着国家有计划地进行经济建设的开始，该厂在废墟上又重建起来。在改建工程中，已将旧炉不合理和不适用的部分全部拆掉，改造了炉缸和炉腹，并安装了几十座高达十八公尺的热风炉。改建工程全部完成后，该厂生铁产量将比日伪统治时期大大提高，目前已经出铁的两个炼铁炉的产量，已较日伪统治时期提高了两倍以上。
    马鞍山铁厂改建工程，得到了各地工人的热烈支援。华东钢铁公司派去了炼铁专家，太原、天津、石景山、本溪以及芜湖等地的钢铁厂都派去了大批工人，中共安徽省委输送去大批的县、区级干部，充实了领导机构。参加改建工程的职工们为了一个共同的目的——加速祖国工业化，发挥了创造性与积极性。七、八月间当地天气十分炎热，工人们全身淌着汗水，在热风炉内坚持工作。混凝土工程队分三班日夜不停地工作，以最快速度提前七天半完成了热风炉的基础工程。
    目前马鞍山铁厂已进入一面生产一面建设时期，该厂职工正为全部炼铁炉在年底以前改建完成投入生产而奋斗。　（张振国）
