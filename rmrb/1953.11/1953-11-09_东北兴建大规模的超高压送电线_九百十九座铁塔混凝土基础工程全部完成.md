    Large-scale Extra-High Voltage Power Transmission Line Under Construction in Northeast China
    Concrete Foundation Work Completed for All 919 Iron Towers
    A large-scale 220,000-volt extra-high voltage power transmission line, one of the largest in our country, is being rapidly built in the Northeast wilderness.
    This transmission line is 369.25 kilometers long. Along the line, 919 "goblet"-shaped large iron towers have been erected. The highest of these towers is 46 meters, and the lowest is 13.9 meters. They are all made up of hundreds of steel materials and more than 4,000 bolts. Each iron tower is like a ten-story building, and below it are four concrete foundations, each two to three square meters in size. Since the official start of construction on July 15th this year, the main project – the concrete foundations for the iron towers – has been completely poured by November 1st. 160 iron towers have already been assembled, and more than 2,000 tons of heavy metal transmission lines will be erected on these towers. To ensure that the entire project is completed by the end of the year and power transmission begins, the basic construction workers on the entire line are enthusiastically launching a labor competition.
    After the completion of this huge transmission line traversing the Northeast region, the abundant and inexpensive electricity of Northeast China can be safely and reliably supplied to Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, and Fuxin and other places to meet the power needs of industrial production and basic construction. After the factories and mines along the line receive sufficient power, they can produce more steel, petroleum, coal, machine tools, and cloth, etc., to supply the needs of the whole country. Various new factories and mines that consume large amounts of electricity will also be rapidly built or put into production with an ample supply of electricity.
    This huge line project was designed by the design personnel of the Northeast Design Branch of the National Electric Power Administration under the guidance of advanced Soviet technology. The entire iron tower and line project are designed to be both economical and strong. In the design process, twelve Soviet experts enthusiastically put forward many valuable suggestions, making the revised design even more perfect. For example, according to the original design, the geological conditions of the tower base were only explored in key areas. After the Soviet experts suggested, it was changed to complete exploration to ensure the firmness and durability of each tower base. More than 40,000 tons of materials required for this project, except for more than 300 tons of materials ordered from abroad, are all domestic materials. Employees of the Shenyang and Tianjin wire factories specially trial-produced steel-cored aluminum wires for 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission. These wires have been shipped to the construction site in batches. The iron tower steel materials rushed out by the employees of the Anshan Iron Tower Factory day and night are also being supplied to the project's needs in batches.
    Also reported: The concrete foundation project for 919 iron towers of the 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line in Northeast China was successfully completed on November 1st before freezing. Chen Yu, Minister of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and responsible cadres of relevant agencies jointly wrote a letter to all employees of this project to express their condolences. The letter stated: Because you have completed this glorious and arduous task and solved the most critical problems of this project, you have created sufficient and favorable conditions for the complete completion of this project within this year.
    The iron tower foundation project is a key part of the entire project, and the quality requirements of the project are very high. If the foundation project is not completed, the tower assembly, wire laying, wire tightening, and other projects cannot be carried out. Therefore, the Northeast Electric Power Administration concentrated its efforts at the end of September to strengthen the specific leadership of this project. The person in charge of the bureau personally went deep into the construction site to check the work section by section, and convened a meeting of construction site directors and team leaders on September 27 to unify the operating procedures and technical standards. In order to strengthen the command force on the construction site, the captains and technical cadres of the original engineering teams directly participated in the construction site work. The project headquarters also sent a large number of cadres divided into eleven groups to go deep into various construction sites to assist in the work to ensure the progress and quality of the project.
    During the days of intense construction, thousands of employees on each construction site overcame many difficulties with selfless labor. When making high mountain foundations, because cars and large trucks could not directly transport materials to the site, the workers carried tons of sand, stones, water, cement, and iron bars to the high mountain site. In August, it rained heavily, and much of the newly excavated foundation soil was washed away by the rain. As soon as the weather cleared up, the workers immediately re-excavated. The workers also risked rain to bravely rescue materials. In October, red flags fluttered in the wilderness, and the workers launched a vigorous labor competition. In the competition, the employees of Construction Site 21 and Construction Site 33 took the lead in completing the foundation project. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北兴建大规模的超高压送电线
    九百十九座铁塔混凝土基础工程全部完成
    我国一条规模最大的二十二万伏超高压送电线，正在东北原野上迅速兴建起来。
    这条送电线路全长三百六十九点二五公里。沿线竖立了九百一十九座“酒杯”形的大铁塔，这些铁塔最高的有四十六公尺，最低的也有十三点九公尺，都是用几百块钢材和四千多只螺丝钉组成的。每座铁塔都宛如一幢十层高的大厦，它的下面都有四座两三平方公尺大的混凝土基础。这条线路自今年七月十五日正式施工以来，到目前为止，主要工程——铁塔混凝土基础已在十一月一日全部浇制完成，铁塔也已经组成了一百六十座，两千多吨重的金属送电线就要架设在这些铁塔上面了。为了保证全部工程在年底结束，并开始送电，全线路的基本建设工人们正在热烈展开劳动竞赛。
    这条纵贯东北地区的巨大的送电线路建成以后，东北丰富而廉价的电力就可以通过这条线路安全可靠地供应鞍山、沈阳、抚顺、本溪和阜新等地工业生产和基本建设的动力需要。沿线各厂矿得到充足的电力以后，就可以生产出更多的钢铁、石油、煤、机床和纱布等各种产品，供应全国的需要；各种大量用电的新工厂、新矿山也将在充裕的电力供应下，迅速地兴建起来或投入生产。
    这个巨大的线路工程，是在苏联先进技术指导下，由我国电业管理总局东北设计分局的设计人员设计的。全部铁塔和线路工程都设计得既经济又坚固。在设计过程中，十二位苏联专家曾热忱地提出了许多宝贵的建议，使得修改后的设计更加完善。例如按原来的设计，塔座的地质情况只作重点勘探，经过苏联专家建议后，改为全部勘探，以保证每个塔座的坚固耐久。这个工程所需的四万多吨材料，除三百多吨材料由国外订货外，其他全部都是国产材料。沈阳、天津两地的电线厂职工们特地为它试制出了二十二万伏超高压送电的钢芯铝线。这些电线已一批一批地运到工地。鞍山市铁塔厂职工们日夜赶制的铁塔钢材，也正分批地供应工程的需要。
    又讯：东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线路的九百十九座铁塔混凝土基础工程，已在封冻前十一月一日胜利完成。中央人民政府燃料工业部部长陈郁和有关机关负责干部特联名写信给这一工程的全体职工，表示慰问。信上说：由于你们完成了这一光荣的艰巨的任务，解决了这一工程的最关键问题，为本年内全部完成这一工程创造了充分的有利条件。
    铁塔基础工程是全部工程的关键部分，工程质量要求很高。如果基础工程不完工，组塔、放线、紧线等工程就没法进行。因此，东北电业管理局在九月末就集中力量加强了对这一工程的具体领导。该局负责人曾亲自深入工地分段检查工作，并在九月二十七日召开了工地主任、队长会议，统一了操作规程、技术标准。为了加强工地指挥力量，原来工程队的队长、技术干部等都直接参加了工地工作。工程指挥部也抽出大批干部分成十一个小组，深入各工地协助工作，以保证工程的进度和质量。
    在紧张施工的日子里，各工地的几千个职工，都以忘我的劳动克服了许多困难。在做高山基础时，因为汽车、大车不能直接运材料到现场，工人们就把成吨重的砂子、石头、水、水泥、铁筋等背上高山现场。八月里，雨下得大，许多刚挖好的基础土被雨水冲塌，天一放晴，工人们就马上重新挖掘。工人们并且冒着雨水奋不顾身地抢救材料。十月里，原野上飘扬着红旗，工人们展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，二一工地和三三工地的职工首先完成了基础工程。（新华社）
