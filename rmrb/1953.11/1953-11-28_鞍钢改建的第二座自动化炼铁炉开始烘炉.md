Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 27th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's renovated second largest automated blast furnace in our country began baking at 1:00 AM on November 27th. This blast furnace, which was destroyed by the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries and stopped production for more than eight years, will soon be put into production.

The personnel in charge of the blast furnace's production had already made all the preparations for baking several days ago. The furnace bodies of the three hot blast stoves supplying wind to this blast furnace smoothly reached the temperature for baking the blast furnace. On the evening of the 26th, Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction department and the iron smelting plant signed the technical completion of the blast furnace. At midnight, the newly built turbo blower began to rotate, sending cold air from thick pipes into the hot blast stoves. When the pointer on the automatic instrument indicated that the wind temperature had reached 100 degrees, Zhou Chuandian, Anshan City Special-Class Labor Model and Deputy Director of Anshan Iron and Steel's Iron Smelting Plant, issued the order to bake the furnace. Immediately afterwards, the workers skillfully opened the hot blast valve, and hot air poured into the blast furnace from the large black pipe high in the air. At this point, the days until this blast furnace is put into production can be counted on the fingers.

    鞍钢改建的第二座自动化炼铁炉开始烘炉
    【新华社鞍山二十七日电】鞍山钢铁公司改建的我国第二座最大的自动化炼铁炉，已在十一月二十七日一时开始烘炉。这座曾遭日伪和国民党反动派破坏而停止生产已八年多的炼铁炉，很快就要投入生产。
    掌握这座炼铁炉生产的人员，早在几天前就作好了烘炉的一切准备工作。供给这座炼铁炉用风的三座热风炉炉体，顺利地达到了烘烤炼铁炉的温度。二十六日晚间，鞍钢基本建设部门和炼铁厂进行了炼铁炉的技术竣工签字。午夜十二时，新建的透平鼓风机开始转动起来，把冷风从粗大的管道里送进了热风炉。当自动计器上的指针，指示出风温已达到一百度时，鞍山市特等劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长周传典下达了烘炉的命令。紧接着，工人们熟练地打开了热风开闭器，热风便从高空黑色的大管道涌进了炼铁炉。至此，这座炼铁炉投入生产的日子已经屈指可数了。
