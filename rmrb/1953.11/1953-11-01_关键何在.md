　　Where Lies the Key?
    Micro Commentary
    Ilya Ehrenburg wrote an article not long ago entitled: "Washington's Dead End." In this article, he wrote: "It should be pointed out that the Korean rain has given many neurasthenic people on the other side of the ocean a very beneficial shower. They gained nothing in Panmunjom, which made them a little more sober." However, the Wall Street bosses have not really sobered up, and high profits have once again clouded their minds. Now, their special envoy Dean has come to Panmunjom in Korea again. This time, the negotiations started in Panmunjom are no longer about how to stop the Korean War, but about how to convene a political conference. In theory, his mind should be clearer. But it seems that he has not learned anything from the more than three years of the Korean War and the more than two years of armistice negotiations. One cannot think that he is smarter than Joy or Harrison.
    As usual, Dean also said a lot of high-sounding words, for example, he said that the United States would solve the problem of the political conference "with complete sincerity and with a reasonable spirit." Let us see how he is showing "sincerity" and a "reasonable spirit"! Dean once emphasized at a press conference that the United States' goal for the political conference is to unify Korea and promote the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Someone asked him why only the Chinese People's Volunteers should withdraw? Dean openly said: This is because "the mutual defense treaty just signed between South Korea and the United States makes it difficult for the United States to withdraw its troops from this peninsula." As everyone knows, the task of the political conference is to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the prerequisite for peacefully resolving the Korean issue is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. That is to say, if all foreign troops are not withdrawn from Korea, the purpose of the political conference cannot be achieved. But Dean openly announced that only the Chinese People's Volunteers were required to withdraw, while the United States, which launched the Korean War of aggression, would continue to keep its troops on this peninsula. This truly portrays the rogue attitude of the American reactionaries towards the political conference, and this is Dean's so-called "sincerity" and "reasonable spirit."
    Of course, the Wall Street bosses and the Pentagon generals have no interest in the political conference in the first place. Didn't Dulles say long ago that the political conference was a "trouble"? Didn't the United States and Syngman Rhee discuss long ago that if the political conference lasted for three months and was still not to their liking, they would withdraw together? Therefore, in the eyes of the United States, it is best not to hold any political conference, so as not to participate and then withdraw, which would increase "trouble." But the United States does not dare to openly resist the political conference, because the people of the world need it, and the United States has to come to talk about the political conference issue. Charles Childs, a columnist for the American "Washington Post," recently reported that the State Department had originally predicted: "The Korean political conference may never be held." So, why was Dean sent to Panmunjom? Childs asserted: This "is merely tactical—in order to dispel the doubts of the Eurasian representatives in the United Nations, because they have begun to feel that the United States does not want to hold a political conference." What a "tactical" "elimination" of "doubts"! This is the truth of Dean's so-called "sincerity" and "reasonable spirit" emphasized in the Panmunjom talks, and this is the annotation of Dean's unreasonable demands in the talks. It seems that in this way, the talks will be fruitless, and Dean can "triumphantly" return to Washington and announce to the "Eurasian representatives in the United Nations": "It is not that the United States does not have 'sincerity' and a 'reasonable spirit,' but..."
    It has been three months and five days since the end of the Korean War. According to the provisions of the armistice agreement, the political conference should have started, and the explanatory work for the non-direct repatriation of prisoners of war should have been carried out with all efforts. However, even the composition of the political conference has not yet been agreed upon, and the explanatory work for the prisoners of war has only been carried out for seven hours and has been suspended for eleven days. The talks on the political conference in Panmunjom have made little progress in a week, the prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps are still often tortured to death by secret agents, and the war cries are becoming more and more ear-piercing; the international situation remains tense. Where lies the key to this unpleasant situation? It lies entirely with the United States, as Ehrenburg said, in "the shortsighted American politicians walking into a dead end." They have walked into the dead end of opposing the participation of neutral countries in the political conference, walked into the dead end of not allowing prisoners of war to freely listen to explanations, and walked into the dead end of delaying and undermining the political conference: although people have already given these "shortsighted American politicians" a warning, hoping that they will "calm down, take a breath, and get out of the dead end." (Ehrenburg), but these stubborn guys are still rushing around there, treating the dead end as their only way out.
    However, the dead end is ultimately "no way through." Didn't the American politicians and generals rush around in the dead end of the aggressive Korean War for a while? In the end, they had to retreat! Our task is to get them out of the dead end as soon as possible, and to get them to sit down and negotiate to resolve all international disputes.

　　关键何在
    微言
    爱伦堡不久以前写了一篇文章，题目叫做：《华盛顿的死胡同》。他在这篇文章中写道：“应当指出，朝鲜的雨使大洋彼岸的许多神经衰弱的人洗了一次很有好处的淋浴，他们在板门店落得一场空，多少使他们清醒一点。”但是，华尔街老板还没有真正清醒过来，又叫高额利润把头脑冲昏了。现在，他们的特使迪安又来到了朝鲜的板门店，这次在板门店开始的谈判，已经不是安排如何停止朝鲜战争，而是安排如何召开政治会议了。论理，他的头脑总该会清醒些了。但是，好像他从三年多的朝鲜战争和两年多的停战谈判中什么也没学到，人们决不能认为他比乔埃或者哈利逊要聪明些。
    照例，迪安也讲了不少冠冕堂皇的话，比方他说，美国将“以完全诚意并以合理的精神”来解决有关政治会议的问题。我们来看他是在如何表现“诚意”和“合理的精神”吧！迪安一次在记者招待会上强调说，美国对于政治会议所怀抱的目的是统一朝鲜和促使中国人民志愿军撤退。有人问他为什么只要中国人民志愿军撤退呢？迪安公然说道：这是因为“南朝鲜与美国刚刚签订的共同防御条约使美国军队很难撤离这个半岛”。人所共知，政治会议的任务是和平解决朝鲜问题，而和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件就是从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。这就是说，如果不从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，政治会议的目的就无法达到。可是迪安居然公开宣布只要求中国人民志愿军撤退，而一手发动侵略朝鲜战争的美国还要继续把它的军队留在这个半岛上，这真是活画出了美国反动分子对待政治会议的流氓态度，这也就是迪安的所谓“诚意”和“合理的精神”。
    当然，对于政治会议，华尔街的老板和五角大楼的将军们本来就是没有兴趣的。杜勒斯不是很早就说过政治会议是一种“麻烦”吗？美国和李承晚不是很早就商量好，政治会议万一开到三个月还不如他们的意，就一起退出吗？所以在美国看来，最好不开什么政治会议，省得参加了又退出，增加“麻烦”。但美国又不敢公开抵制政治会议，因为全世界人民需要它，美国也只得来对政治会议问题进行会谈了。美国《华盛顿邮报》的专栏作家蔡尔兹最近报道，本来国务院已经预言：“朝鲜政治会议可能永远不会举行了。”那么，为什么又把迪安派到板门店去呢？蔡尔兹断言：这“仅仅是策略性的——为了要消除联合国中的欧亚代表们的疑虑，因为他们已开始感觉到，美国不想举行政治会议。”好一个“策略性的”“消除”“疑虑”，这就是迪安在板门店会谈中强调的所谓“诚意”和“合理的精神”的真相，这就是迪安在会谈中一味无理取闹的注解。似乎这样一来，会谈一无所成，迪安就可以“凯旋”华盛顿，对“联合国中的欧亚代表们”宣布：“不是美国没有‘诚意’和‘合理的精神’，而是……”
    朝鲜战争停止以来已经三个月又五天了，按照停战协定的规定，政治会议应该开始举行，对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作应该全力进行了。可是，现在连政治会议究竟应该如何组成还未取得协议，对战俘的解释工作一共只进行了七个小时就停顿了十一天。板门店关于政治会议的会谈一周以来得不到什么进展，战俘营中的战俘还常常在特务的折磨下死去，战争叫嚣越来越刺耳；国际局势仍然保持着紧张状态。造成这种不愉快情况的关键何在？完全在于美国，像爱伦堡所说的，在于“短视的美国政客们走进了死胡同。”走进了反对中立国参加政治会议的死胡同，走进了不让战俘自由地听取解释的死胡同，走进了拖延和破坏政治会议的死胡同：虽然人们已经向这些“短视的美国政客”做了忠告，希望他们“冷静一点，歇一口气，退出死胡同。”（爱伦堡），而这些冥顽不灵的家伙，还在那里横冲直撞，把死胡同当做他们唯一的出路所在。
    可是，死胡同终究是“此路不通”的，美国的政客和将军们不是在侵略朝鲜战争的这条死胡同里冲撞了一阵子吗？结果还是不得不退了出来！我们的任务就是要把他们早一点弄出死胡同，要他们坐下来进行协商，来解决一切国际争端。
