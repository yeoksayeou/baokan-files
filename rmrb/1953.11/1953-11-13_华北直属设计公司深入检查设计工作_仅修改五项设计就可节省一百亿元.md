    North China Directly Subordinate Design Company Conducts In-Depth Inspection of Design Work
    Modifying Only Five Designs Could Save One Hundred Billion Yuan
    Responding to the call for increased production and thrift, the North China Directly Subordinate Design Company is preparing to summarize its design work for the year. In September, it organized administrative cadres and technical personnel to inspect five key projects by reviewing drawings, conducting on-site comparisons, and holding discussions with basic construction departments. Preliminary results from the inspection of the five projects revealed over 600 issues of varying sizes. Some designs were not well-researched, leading to serious waste. For example, the sewer system for Project 5313 was initially designed for integrated drainage. After inspection, it was changed to sectional drainage, saving 1.7 billion yuan. Changing the heating duct to a cement pipe could save 700 million yuan. For Project 102, in the sand alone, the original design specified Shahe sand, but now by using nearby sand, over 2 billion yuan can be saved. In addition to the existing waste from completed portions, the modification of the designs for the five projects inspected is expected to save approximately 100 billion yuan. Carelessness and irresponsibility have also caused significant losses. For example, the window opening dimensions for the office building of Project 5319 were two meters on the design drawings, but 2.5 meters on the detailed drawings, and with other windows the upper lintel was 3.5 by 9.5, but the lower lintel was 4 by 9.5. The result was windows that were narrower at the top and wider at the bottom. The architectural drawings for Project 5333 showed expansion joints, but the electrical drawings did not. Similar problems could be found on almost every drawing for this project. The design for all the office buildings in this project was originally based on British and American elastic theory, specifying two stories. After the foundations were laid, calculations based on Soviet plastic theory led to a redesign for three stories. The project is now complete, and the facts prove that changing to three stories presented no problems. This fully demonstrates the superiority of advanced Soviet theory. The inspection revealed that there were many problems in the design work, some of which were quite serious. The company is now summarizing the results of this inspection, studying the design procedures, communication systems, design responsibility system, and design quotas at each stage, in order to implement planned management and meet the new tasks for 1954.

    华北直属设计公司深入检查设计工作
    仅修改五项设计就可节省一百亿元
    华北直属设计公司响应增产节约号召，并准备总结本年设计工作。特于九月开始，组织行政干部与技术人员，通过检查图纸，现场对照，与基本建设施工部门座谈等方式，对五个重点工程进行了设计检查。据五个工程检查的初步结果，共发现大小问题六百多件。其中有些设计未经很好研究，发生严重的浪费现象。如五三一三工程的下水道，前设计用整体排水，经过检查改为分部排水，可节省十七亿元；暖气沟改为水泥管可省七亿元。一○二工程只用沙子一项，原设计是用沙河沙，现改用附近的沙，就可节省二十余亿元。除已完工的既成浪费外，这次检查的五个工程设计经修改后，约可节省一百亿元左右。由于粗枝大叶、不负责任造成损失的也不少。如五三一九工程办公楼的窗子口径是二公尺，而大样图是二点五公尺。其他窗子的上帽头是三点五乘九点五，下帽头是四乘九点五。结果窗子上窄下宽。五三三三工程建筑图上有伸缩缝，但电气图上却没有。在这个工程中几乎每张图都可找到类似的毛病。这个工程全部办公楼的设计，原来是根据英美弹性理论设计为二层，基础打起后，根据苏联塑性理论计算又改成三层，现在这个工程已全部完工，事实证明改三层没有任何问题。这充分证明了苏联先进理论的优越性。经过这次检查，可以看出设计工作中的问题是很多的，而且有些是比较严重的。现在该公司正在总结这次检查的结果，研究各段的设计程序、联系制度、设计责任制与设计定额等，以便实行计划管理，迎接一九五四年的新任务。（李荫蓬）
