    The So-Called POW "Hospital"
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jin
    Based on our accusations, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission conducted an investigation into the murder incidents in the Dongchang-ri "hospital" on November 21. However, due to the illegal resistance of the U.S. special agents, the members of the subsidiary bodies of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and our witnesses were unable to enter the so-called "hospital" camp, rendering the investigation fruitless. This once again proves that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not take effective measures against those U.S. special agents, it will be unable to uphold the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and exercise its legitimate powers.
    Another Blood Debt
    Speaking of the murderous crimes of the POW camp "hospital," people must not have forgotten that returnee Wang Xianzhang was one who escaped death from this "hospital." Before he escaped from the barbed wire, he had been hung up and beaten for a night and sentenced to death, and a pit had been dug to bury him alive.
    Now, Wang Xianzhang, who made a strong accusation against the murderers, has become one of the witnesses for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the October 1st "hospital" murder incident.
    The victim, Zhang Liutai, was a volunteer soldier POW who insisted on repatriation. On September 29, as soon as he arrived at the bed in the No. 44 camp of the "hospital," before anyone knew his name, he was being tortured by a long-term incurable disease and persecution to prevent his repatriation, he was caught by new bloody hands. The "translator" special agent Wang Junsheng peeled open his chest and back and arms and found that he had no tattoos, and he cursed angrily: "Damn, you want to return to the Communist Party, I will beat you to death." Special agent leader Deng Hongxun and his group of assistant special agents immediately surrounded him. Deng said sternly, "Where are you going back to?" He could only make a slight but firm voice: "Back to China!" Deng cursed, "Back to China, dream on!" Then he changed his tone and said, "Isn't Taiwan good?" Zhang Liutai did not answer. Deng became even more furious: "Damn, you are determined. You can't escape." The guard captain surnamed Shou then shouted to the guard Guo An: "Keep an eye on him."
    The murderers, special agents Deng Hongxun, Hu Kechang, the guard captain surnamed Shou, and Yu Rongfu, held a meeting to discuss and decided to starve Zhang Liutai to death. The victim was starved for two consecutive days, but he still did not say a word.
    At about 9:00 a.m. on October 1, Neutral Nations personnel came to inspect the "hospital." Deng Hongxun and other special agents coerced the POWs to rush out and fight, causing a conflict with the Indian soldiers. Afterwards, Deng Hongxun smiled like he had discovered something and said, "Today is a good opportunity, beat this guy to death, and say that he was beaten to death by the Indian soldiers. Everyone should put on Mercurochrome and say they were injured by the Indian soldiers." The special agents all grinned and said in unison: "Good idea, hurry up and beat him." Squad leader Xu Lingui and guard Xia Daming picked up the headboards of the iron beds and said, "Okay, I'll beat him." Deng ordered the man to be carried to the rear left corner of the tent and shouted, "Beat him!" Xu Lingui raised his hand and struck Zhang Liutai on the head. The first blow hit the top of his head, and the second blow hit his face. He was knocked unconscious immediately. The two murderers beat him repeatedly on the head with clubs, causing his head to bleed. Deng immediately wrapped his head with gauze to pretend that he was beaten by Indian soldiers. Then they carried him back to his bed and covered him with a blanket. But the special agents found that Zhang Liutai was not dead yet. Deng shouted again: "Hurry up, he's not dead yet, come on, strangle him to death." Xu Lingui and Xia Daming each used a stick to clamp around his neck, and stuffed his mouth with a dry towel, and pressed down with all their strength. At the same time, guard Guo An punched him like a beast and stomped on his stomach... The crime was thus completed.
    Such "Investigation"
    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces had a lesson in "investigating" this incident.
    That day, after the murderers committed the crime, they immediately notified the "hospital" owner, the U.S. military "medical officer," to send "nurses" to carry away the corpse. Then the four special agent leaders held a meeting and decided that when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission came to investigate, Hu Kechang would pretend to be seriously ill and testify, insisting that he was beaten to death by the Indian soldiers. In the evening, the special agents also drafted a "petition," which was sent to their masters in Washington, Taiwan, and Seoul, accusing the Indian soldiers of killing POWs. After writing it, they forced the POWs to affix blood fingerprints.
    On the morning of October 2, an officer of the Indian Custodial Forces came to investigate. Deng Hongxun shouted loudly, "Don't investigate without a UN representative present." The Indian officer withdrew. In less than a few minutes, a short, black-faced "translator" surnamed Wei, wearing a U.S. military uniform and tinted glasses, came to the camp and said to Deng Hongxun: "I'm here, you must insist that the Indian soldiers beat him, don't change your story." Then the "investigation" began. The "seriously ill" murderer Hu Kechang was carried out and testified. The U.S. "doctor" lieutenant and another U.S. military officer were writing records along with the Indian officer. After writing, they handed it to the surname Wei to read it once, and the "investigation" was over. Hu Kechang returned to the tent and said triumphantly: "The Indians have admitted it! We have won this lawsuit for murder!"
    The murderers were playing with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops in this way. If we had not proposed to conduct an investigation, then the murderers would have blamed the crime of murder on the Indian Custodial Forces.
    Who Controls Dongchang-ri
    Why are the murderers so rampant? Isn't the "hospital" here a humanitarian undertaking providing services to POWs as stipulated in the "scope of authority"? This is a question that anyone cannot help but ask. Answering these questions can also reveal all the secrets.
    When the "hospital" murderers decided to "starve" Zhang Liutai, they were instructed by such a "personage." This "personage" was simply the embodiment of terror and bloodshed to the people in Dongchang-ri. His title was "Teacher Ma." Dressed in a U.S. military uniform, wearing the symbol of a U.S. 8th Army nursing staff, he was made of the dregs of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek gang, flowing with base and brutal blood. He frequently came and went in this so-called "hospital."
    On October 2, when carrying dinner, the murderer Deng Hongxun went to the "kitchen" and told a man named Ge Yunfei about the murder, and said: "Teacher Ma taught us that we can starve those who want to return to their country to death, so as not to reveal any traces, but after starving for two days, he still didn't die. Today, we finally had a good opportunity to beat him to death."
    "Teacher Ma" and the "hospital" are the centers for issuing orders for U.S. special agent activities in the Dongchang-ri POW camp.
    Turning the hospital into the center of special agent activities is a conspiracy plan that the U.S. had already made. As early as mid-August this year, at the "POW Representative Conference" held by the U.S. military police headquarters on Jeju Island, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent "Teacher Shi" instructed "Third Regiment Commander" Ying Xiangyun and "Deputy Regiment Commander" Wang Futian: "After arriving in the neutral zone, you can send people to work in the hospital and use the hospital as our liaison office." A few days later, at the "Third Regiment Battalion Commander Conference," Ying Xiangyun and Wang Futian also talked to the battalion commanders about the plan to send people to infiltrate the hospital after arriving in the neutral zone. In late August, Ying Xiangyun and Wang Xu, who has now been repatriated and returned, also talked about this matter.
    As soon as they arrived in the neutral zone, the Li Chiang special agents began to infiltrate the hospital. Deng Hongxun, the special agent leader of the No. 44 camp of the hospital, and Zhang Hongchun, the special agent leader of the No. 45 camp, infiltrated in mid-September. At the beginning, there were not many patients in the hospital, and all the medical, nursing staff, medicines, and food were supplied by the Indian army. However, since September 23, when Deng Hongxun, a special agent who sneaked into the hospital, coerced the hospitalized personnel to clash with the Indian army, the Indian staff stopped entering the hospital camp to work. "Teacher Ma" and others then replaced them with U.S. military and Syngman Rhee "medical staff." This group of new masters began to adjust the camp, dividing it into internal, external, and lung disease departments, and transferred important special agents and designated liaison persons from the camps in each enclosure. The "kitchen" of the "hospital" became the general liaison station.
    Ge Yunfei, the general liaison officer of the "kitchen" responsible for contacting "Teacher Ma," and his assistants, such as Cai Peipei, who was responsible for contacting a U.S. military officer stationed in the "hospital" "responsible for supply," Liu Nanping, who was responsible for liaison between the regiments, Gao Sizheng, who was responsible for liaison with the North Korean People's Army POW camp special agents, and Korean special agent Li Da Fatzi, etc., also infiltrated one after another.
    The U.S. military "medical personnel," "nurses," "Teacher Ma," and their "Coalition Forces staff" thus seized the "hospital" and became the actual masters of Dongchang-ri.
    Issuing Orders
    Speaking of the "personage" who issued orders in the "hospital," one cannot fail to mention the U.S. military "medical personnel" who did not come forward much. According to our returnees, in early October, the U.S. military authorities stationed in the "hospital" convened meetings with the special agents in the "hospital" camp twice. Yu Rongfu, a special agent from the No. 44 camp, Zhao Jinzhong, the battalion commander of the No. 45 camp, and Cao Fei, a special agent from the lung disease department camp, all attended. Yu Rongfu said after returning to the camp: "Today, the U.S. military officer asked us to attend a meeting, and we discussed the issue of driving away the Indian troops guarding the entrance of the camp." The Indian troops could only stand guard at the entrances of the camps, while the U.S. "nurses" could still frequently bring special agents from the various camps of the "hospital" in and out. However, even this made the special agents feel that their freedom of movement was being "forced."
    The special agents in the "kitchen" directly followed the instructions of "Teacher Ma" and the "Koreans" to carry out liaison and control activities with the special agents in the entire Dongchang-ri camp. On September 27, after our returnee Chang Zhongxin was transferred to the "kitchen," Ge Yunfei said to him: "This work is very important. Cooking is secondary. The main thing is to liaise with the regiments, with 'Teacher Ma,' and with the 'Koreans.'"
    There are many ways for the "kitchen" to liaise with the regiments. Among them, the important ones are to pass messages through each camp "escorting patients" and the coming and going of patients, and also to rely on the "underground work team" (composed of South Korean "workers" and "drivers" who work in each camp, pour garbage, and pour feces) to carry out liaison.
    The instructions conveyed by the "hospital" special agents to the regiments were not only transmitted through "Teacher Ma" and these people, but also directly transmitted by the "Korean medical staff" coming and going from Seoul.
    In this way, the U.S. side, through the special agent forces, undermined the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian army over the POW camp, and completely established the violent rule of the Li Chiang special agents in implementing the instructions of Tokyo, Taiwan, and Seoul over the POWs.
    Murderous "Hospital"
    Since the "hospital" has become the command post for all dark and terrifying activities in Dongchang-ri, then the "hospital" itself is of course a place of extreme ridicule of "humanity" and "mercy."
    Bloody incidents are constantly happening in the "hospital." Returnee Wang Xianzhang said that after breakfast on October 7, he heard Zhang Jinguang, a patient with epilepsy in the mental illness department in the iron shed of the No. 44 camp (he often passed on information to Deng Hongxun when he was not ill), said to Deng: "The Koreans killed three people." Deng asked: "Why?" Zhang replied: "The first person wanted to jump over the barbed wire and was caught back. He was hit on the head a few times, and he was buried alive before he could breathe. Later, two more people also wanted to climb over the barbed wire and were caught back and beaten to death." Later, Wang Xianzhang ran into Zhang Jinguang outside the tent, and Zhang pointed to a pile of new soil and showed him: "It's buried there."
    There are only a few people in the internal medicine department of the No. 44 camp who are seriously ill and cannot get out of bed. If they get better, they are not allowed to leave the hospital. "Teacher Ma" said that "patients cannot listen to explanations," and the special agents want to take them to "consolidate strength." As for those who are seriously ill in each camp, even if Indian doctors diagnose that they should be hospitalized (the Indian army has ambulances and medical staff patrolling the camps to see patients), they cannot go without the permission of the "battalion commander." Returnee Liu Yongchang was seriously ill and was not allowed to go to the "hospital." Even if you get to the "hospital," it's really up to God. In early October, a seriously ill patient was sent from the First Regiment to the internal medicine department of the No. 44 camp. He was not treated and was only given thin soup three times a day. After four or five days, the patient could not speak, and often defecated in bed. After ten days of dragging on, his teeth were tightly closed and he could not eat or drink for three days, so he died. There are still seriously ill patients Yao Rugao, Li Yingxiang, and Guo Gang, who have been seriously ill for more than a year. Because the U.S. military "doctor" has never been responsible for treatment, they have not been able to alleviate their suffering.
    Returnee Li Tiancai saw in mid-September a seriously ill patient with diphtheria who had just been sent from Jeju Island. Because he requested repatriation, he was beaten and scalded with boiling water. After arriving at the No. 45 camp, the U.S. military "doctor" cut his throat halfway open and inserted a rubber tube to inflate it. His mouth was dry, and he asked for some vegetable soup, but no one dared to give it to him. One day, Li Tiancai took a rice bowl out of the tent to get vegetable soup. He ran into the battalion commander at the door and was scolded: "Do you want to die too? You are not allowed to give him vegetable soup to drink." This seriously ill patient died in such pain.
    In the "hospital," special agents arbitrarily announced illegal "discipline." For example, in the No. 44 camp, special agents announced new "discipline" almost every day. For example, you must take off your clothes when you sleep at night. POW Yang Defa was slapped after sleeping in an outer garment because it was cold, and was forced to take it off; POWs must speak loudly and openly, and are not allowed to whisper together in twos and threes; no one is allowed to approach within two steps of the barbed wire; it is not allowed to say "strange things" such as "not enough to eat and not enough to wear." The No. 45 camp does not allow you to tell your name or ask where your hometown is. The POWs kept their breath all day long, did not say a word, and covered their heads with blankets when they heard someone being beaten. Li Tiancai, a seriously wounded returnee, thought that he was destined to be sent to Taiwan. He struggled desperately, practiced walking, endured the pain and asked to be discharged from the hospital. Finally, he was discharged from the hospital for three days and came back after listening to the explanation at the No. 22 camp. He said: "I really didn't expect that I almost didn't come back."

    Can any upright person tolerate such a "hospital"?

    所谓战俘“医院”
    本报记者　胡今
    中立国遣返委员会根据我方的指控，曾于十一月二十一日对东场里
  “医院”中谋杀事件进行了调查，然而由于美方特务的非法抵制，中立国遣返委员会附属机构委员们和我方证人根本未能进入所谓“医院”营场，使调查工作毫无结果。这就再一次证明，如果中立国遣返委员会不对那些美方特务采取有效措施，那末，它就无法维护“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”并行使其合法职权。
    又一笔血债
    谈到战俘营“医院”的谋杀罪行，人们一定还没有忘记，归来人员王宪章就是从这个“医院”死里逃生的一个。在他逃出铁丝网之前已被吊打了一晚，并宣布了他的死刑，挖好了活埋他的土坑。
    现在，正是对杀人犯们提出了有力的控诉的王宪章，成了中立国遣返委员会调查十月一日“医院”谋杀事件的作证人之一了。
    被害者张六泰是一个坚持要求遣返的志愿军战俘。他在九月二十九日一到“医院”四十四号营场的病床上，还没有人知道他的姓名，他正为长期的得不到医治的重病和阻止他遣返的迫害磨折得不能哼一声，却又被新的血手抓住了。“翻译”特务王俊生剥开他的前胸后背和胳膊发现他没有刺字，就暴怒地大骂：“他妈的，要回共产党，老子把你打死”。特务头子邓鸿勋和他的一批助手特务立即围上前来。邓厉声问他：“你回那里去？”他只能发出轻微的但是坚决的声音：“回中国！”邓就大骂：“回中国，作梦呀！”又转口说：“台湾不好吗？”张六泰不答。邓就更加暴跳起来：“他妈的，你坚决呀。你跑不脱。”姓守的警备队长接着向警备队员郭安喝道：“把他看起来。”
    凶手特务邓鸿勋、胡克昌、姓守的警备队长和于荣福开会讨论，决定把张六泰饿死。受难者一连饿了两天，但他还是不吭气。
    十月一日九时许，中立国人员来视察“医院”，邓鸿勋等特务胁迫战俘冲出去打，与印度兵发生冲突。事后邓鸿勋像发现什么似的狞笑着说：“今天好机会来了，把这家伙打死，说是印度兵打死的，每个人都要抹上红汞，就说是被印度兵打伤的。”特务们都裂开了血嘴齐声说：“好办法，赶快打。”警备班长徐林贵和警备队员夏大明就拿起行军床头的挡棍说：“好，我来打。”邓命令把人架到帐篷左后角，喝道：“打！”徐林贵举手向张六泰劈头打去，第
  一下打中了头顶，第二下打中了脸，他被打得立即昏倒下去，两个凶手接连在他头上乱棍打起来，打得他满头流血。邓即用纱布包他的头，好装作是印度兵打的。然后把他抬回病床上，用毯盖好。但特务们发现张六泰还没有死，邓又叫：“赶快，还没死，来，把他轧死。”徐林贵和夏大明就各用一根棍子夹在他的脖子上，并用干毛巾把他嘴塞住，一齐地尽力压。同时警备队员郭安像野兽一样用拳头打，又用脚踩肚子……。罪行就这样完成了。
    如此“调查”
    中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队是有过“调查”这一事件的教训的。
      那天，凶手们犯了罪后，马上通知“医院”的主人美军“医官”派“看护兵”载走了尸首，接着四个特务头子就开会决定：中立国遣返委员会来调查时，由胡克昌装重病号作证，咬定是印度兵打死的。晚上，特务们并起草“请愿书”，分送他们的华盛顿、台湾和汉城的主人们，控告印度兵杀了战俘。写好后强迫战俘捺血印。
    十月二日早晨，印度看管部队的一个军官来调查。邓鸿勋就高声喊：“没有联合国总代表在场，不要调查。”印度军官就退出来了。不到几分钟，就来了一个穿美军制服，戴茶色眼镜，黑面孔的矮个子姓魏的“翻译”到营场对邓鸿勋说：“我来了，你们要咬定是印度兵打的，不要变更。”接着“调查”开始了。抬出来的“重病号”胡克昌凶手作了证，美国“医生”中尉和另一美国军官跟印度军官都在写记录，写好了交姓魏的看一遍，“调查”就结束了。胡克昌回到帐篷得意地说：“印度人承认了！这场人命官司我们打赢了！”
    杀人犯们竟这样玩弄中立国遣返委员会和印度部队。如果不是我方提出要进行调查，那末，杀人犯们便把杀人的罪责赖在印度看管部队的身上了。
    谁控制了东场里
    为什么杀人犯们敢于这样横行不法呢？这里的
  “医院”不是“职权范围”规定的为战俘提供服务的人道事业吗？这是任何人都不能不发出的问题。答复了这些问题，也就能揭开一切的秘密。
    “医院”杀人犯们决定“饿死”张六泰时，是得到了这样的一个“人物”的指使的，这个“人物”在东场里的人听来简直就是恐怖与血腥的化身。他的称号叫“马老师”。身穿一套美军制服，佩带美军第八军看护人员的符号，他是台湾蒋匪帮渣滓材料所造成的，流着卑贱而又凶残的血液。他经常出入于这里所谓的“医院”。
    十月二日抬晚饭时，杀人犯邓鸿勋到了“伙房”，对一个叫葛云飞的讲了行凶经过后就说：“马老师教我们说，可以把那要回国的家伙饿死，这样不致露痕迹，但饿了两天还不死，今天总算有好机会把他打死了。”
    “马老师”、“医院”，这就是东场里战俘营场美方特务活动的发号施令的中心。
    把医院变为特务活动的中心，这是美方早就作好了的阴谋计划。远在今年八月中旬，在济州岛美军宪兵司令部召开的“战俘代表会议”中，蒋匪特务“史老师”即曾指示“第三联队长”应祥云、
  “联队副”王福田说：“到中立区后，你们可以派人到医院工作，把医院作为我们的联络机关。”数日后，“第三联队大队长会议”上，应祥云、王福田也曾和各大队长谈了到中立区后派人打进医院的计划。八月下旬，应祥云和现已遣返归来的王旭也谈过这件事。
      一到中立区，李蒋特务即开始打入医院。医院四十四号营场特务头子邓鸿勋和四十五号营场特务头子张洪春，在九月中旬就打进去了。开头，医院病人不多，一切医疗、护理人员和药品饮食都是印军供给的。但自九月二十三日那天，潜入医院的特务邓鸿勋胁迫住院人员与印军冲突后，印度工作人员即停止进入医院营场工作，“马老师”等随即与美军和李承晚“医务人员”取而代之。这批新主人开始调整营场，划分内、外、肺病等科，并从各围场的营场中调入重要特务分子和指定联络人，“医院”的“伙房”成了联络总站。
    “伙房”总联络人、负责与“马老师”联络的葛云飞和他的助手们，如负责与一个驻“医院”
  “负责给养供给”的美军军官联络的蔡培培、负责与各联队之间的联络工作的刘南屏、负责与朝鲜人民军战俘营场特务联络的高思正和朝鲜籍特务李大胖子等，也先后打进去了。
    美军“医务人员”、“看护兵”、“马老师”、和其“联军工作人员”就这样夺取了“医院”，成为东场里的实际主人。
    发号施令
    谈到“医院”里发号施令的“人物”，不能不提到并不怎样出面的美军“医务人员”。据我方归来人员所知道的，在十月上旬，美军驻“医院”当局曾两次召集“医院”营场特务分子开过会。四十四号营场特务于荣福、四十五号营场大队长赵尽忠、肺病科营场特务曹飞都曾出席。于荣福回到营场后说：“今天美军校官找我们去开会，我们讨论了赶走营场门口站岗印军的问题”。印军只能在各营场门口站岗，而美国“看护兵”仍可经常带着
  “医院”各营场的特务分子进进出出。但是，就这样也还是使特务们觉得对自己的自由活动受到“强制”了。
      “伙房”的特务们直接秉承“马老师”和“韩国人”的指示进行与整个东场里营场特务的联络和控制活动。九月二十七日，我方归来人员常中信那时被调到“伙房”后，葛云飞对他说：“这里工作很重要，做饭是捎带，主要是和各联队、和‘马老师’和‘韩国人’联络”。
      “伙房”与各联队的联络方法很多，其中重要的是经过各营场“护送病号”及病号来往传递消息，还可以依靠“地下工作队”（由在各营场内做工、倒垃圾、倒粪的南朝鲜籍“工人”、“司机”组成）进行联系。
      “医院”特务对各联队传达的指示，不仅有经过“马老师”这些人传递的，还有由“韩国医务人员”直接来往汉城传递的。
    美方就这样通过特务势力破坏了中立国遣返委员会和印军对战俘营的控制，并把李蒋特务为奉行东京、台湾和汉城的指令而实行对战俘的暴力统治完完整整地建立起来了。
    杀人“医院”
   “医院”既成了东场里一切黑暗与恐怖活动的司令台，那末，“医院”本身也当然就不能不是对“人道”和“仁慈”极大嘲弄的场所了。
    血案不断地在“医院”里发生着。归来人员王宪章说，他在十月七日早饭后听见四十四号营场铁篷子内精神病科的羊痫疯病号张金光（他在病不发时经常向邓鸿勋传递情报）对邓说：“朝鲜人打死了三个”。邓问：“为什么？”张答：“第一个人想跳铁丝网被抓了回来，头上给打了几棒子，还未等咽气就活埋了。后来又有两个也想翻铁丝网，也被抓回活活打死了。”后来，王宪章在帐篷外碰到张金光，张还指着一堆新土给他看：“就埋在那里。”
    四十四号营场内科重病不能起床的，不过几个人。病好了不给出院，“马老师”说“病人可不听解释”，特务要拿他们“巩固力量”。至于各营场病重的，虽经印度医生诊断认为应住医院（印军有救护车和医务人员在营场间巡回看病）时，不经
  “大队长”准许，也不能去。归来人员刘永昌有重病就不让到“医院”去。就是到了“医院”，那也真是天晓得。十月初，一联队送一个重病号到四十四号营场内科后，并没有给治疗，每日只给喝三次稀汤，四、五天后病人即不能言语，经常在床上大小便，拖了十天后，牙关紧闭，三天不能进饮食，他就死了。现在还有重病号姚如高、李英祥和郭刚等人，重病已一年以上，因美军“医生”一直没给负责治疗，至今未能减轻苦楚。
    归来人员李天才曾在九月中旬看见一个刚从济州岛送来的患白喉症的重病号，因他要求遣返曾被毒打，并用开水泡。到了四十五号营场后，美军“医生”就把他的喉管割开一半，用橡皮管插入打气。他嘴里干燥，要求喝点菜汤，没人敢给他。有一天，李天才拿饭缸出帐篷打菜汤，在门口碰见大队长，被大骂：“你也想死吗？不准给他菜汤喝。”这个重病号就这样痛苦地死去了。
    在“医院”里，特务分子任意宣布非法的“纪律”。如在四十四号营场，特务分子每天差不多都有新的“纪律”宣布。如晚上睡觉要脱掉衣服，病俘杨德发因天冷穿外衣睡觉，被打耳光后强令脱下；战俘要讲话就要大声讲，公开讲，不准三三两两一起嘀咕；离铁丝网两步以外任何人不准接近；不准说吃不饱穿不暖等“怪话”。四十五号营场不准通姓名，不准问家乡在那里。病俘们整天闷住气，不吭气，听见打人就用毯子蒙住头。负伤很重的归来人员李天才，以为注定要被送台湾了，他拼命挣扎起来，练习走路，忍着痛要求出院，终于出院三天，在二十二号营场听解释时回来了。他说：“真想不到，只差一点就回不来了。”

    如此“医院”，任何正直的人能忍受吗？
