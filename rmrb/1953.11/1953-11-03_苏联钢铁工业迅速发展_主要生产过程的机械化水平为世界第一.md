Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: The Soviet steel industry is rapidly developing according to the great program of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

Since the beginning of national industrialization, the Soviet Union has never relaxed its attention to the development of the steel industry. The Soviet Union regards the development of the steel industry as a prerequisite for the development of various industrial sectors, construction, transportation, and agriculture. In 1928, the first year of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union produced 3.4 million tons of pig iron and 4.3 million tons of steel. By 1952, the second year of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan, Soviet pig iron production had reached 25 million tons, and steel production had reached 35 million tons. Even during the difficult period of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union vigorously developed the steel industry, which was crucial for national defense, and built ten blast furnaces, thirty-two open-hearth furnaces, sixteen electric steelmaking furnaces, two converters, and fifteen rolling mills in the eastern region.

In the past three years, the Soviet Union's annual increase in steel production has been three to four million tons, which is almost equal to the total annual steel production at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. This year, the Soviet Union's steel production will reach more than 38 million tons. The Soviet Union's current steel production is approximately equal to the total of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Sweden. From 1946 to 1952, the growth rate of Soviet steel production exceeded that of the United States and the United Kingdom by two to three times.

In the Soviet Union, during eight months of 1952, the average effective volume of blast furnaces in steel industry enterprises produced one ton of pig iron per 0.88 cubic meters (the No. 3 blast furnace of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Urals had already produced one ton of pig iron per 0.64 cubic meters in October of this year), and the open-hearth furnace bottom produced 6.19 tons of steel per square meter (recently, at the Petrovsky Iron and Steel Works in Dnepropetrovsk, the No. 4 open-hearth furnace bottom produced 7.22 tons of steel per square meter). However, in the best steel plants in the United States, blast furnaces with an effective volume of more than one cubic meter produce one ton of pig iron, and open-hearth furnace bottom areas produce only 5.3 tons of steel per square meter. Soviet steelmaking workers widely use the rapid steelmaking method. Many workers smelted four heats of steel per day and night. The Yakimenko team of the No. 10 open-hearth furnace at the Zaporozhye Steel Plant recently smelted a heat of steel in five hours and twenty-five minutes.

The achievements of the Soviet steel industry are inseparable from the superiority of the socialist system, the workers' labor enthusiasm, and high-level technology. At the beginning of 1951, large blast furnaces with an effective volume of more than 1,000 cubic meters accounted for 51 percent of the total blast furnace volume in the Soviet Union, while they only accounted for 46 percent in the United States; large open-hearth furnaces with a capacity of more than 200 tons accounted for 36 percent of the total open-hearth furnace capacity in the Soviet Union, while they only accounted for 12 percent in the United States. The laborious operating processes in the main workshops of Soviet steel factories have been almost completely mechanized. Its level of mechanization in the main steel production processes ranks first in the world, exceeding that of capitalist countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. During this Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet steel industry will achieve complete mechanization from the main production processes to the auxiliary and repair processes. The level of automation is also increasing. Currently, 95 percent of pig iron and 87 percent of steel in the Soviet Union are smelted by automated blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. During this Five-Year Plan period, the work of batching and weighing materials for blast furnaces will be automated, blast furnaces will be equipped with instruments to measure the amount of dust at the furnace top, and instruments will be manufactured to measure the temperature of the metal smelted in open-hearth furnace troughs; the degree of complete automation of rolling mills and steel pipe rolling machines will be improved.

Soviet steel workers receive great care from the state. Their wages are higher than those in other industries. From 1946 to 1951, 650,000 steel workers improved their technical skills in various forms of education. They will receive new housing with a construction area of 50,000 square meters during this Five-Year Plan period.

By 1955, the Soviet steel industry will reach ten times the production level of 1928. In order to fulfill and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, Soviet steel workers are striving to fully utilize existing equipment, expand enterprises, improve quality, increase product varieties, increase labor productivity, save raw materials, materials, and reduce production costs.

    苏联钢铁工业迅速发展
    主要生产过程的机械化水平为世界第一
    【新华社莫斯科二日电】苏联钢铁工业按照第五个五年计划的伟大纲领，正在迅速地向前发展着。
    自从开始国家工业化建设以来，苏联一直没有放松过对发展钢铁工业的注意。苏联把钢铁工业的发展看作工业各部门、建筑业、运输业和农业发展的前提。在一九二八年，苏联第一个五年计划的第一年，苏联生产了三百四十万吨生铁和四百三十万吨钢。到了一九五二年，即苏联第五个五年计划的第二年，苏联生铁产量已达到二千五百万吨，钢产量达三千五百万吨。甚至在伟大的卫国战争的困难时期，苏联还大力发展了对国防有决定意义的钢铁工业，在东部地区建设了十座高炉、三十二座平炉、十六座电力炼钢炉、两座转炉、十五座轧钢机。
    最近三年来苏联每年钢的增产量就有三、四百万吨，几乎等于第一个五年计划开始时期的全年产钢量。今年苏联的产钢量将达到三千八百多万吨。苏联现在的产钢量约等于英、法、比利时和瑞典四国的总和。在一九四六到一九五二年中，苏联钢铁生产增长的速度，超过了美国和英国两、三倍。
      苏联在一九五二年八个月中，钢铁工业企业的高炉平均有效容积每零点八八立方公尺炼出一吨生铁（乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂第三号大高炉在今年十月已从零点六四立方公尺炼出一吨生铁），平炉炉底每平方公尺出钢六点一九吨（最近在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的彼得罗夫斯克钢铁厂，第四号平炉炉底每平方公尺出钢七点二二吨）。而美国最好的钢铁厂，高炉有效容积每一立方公尺以上才炼出一吨生铁，平炉炉底面积每平方公尺出钢仅五点三吨。苏联炼钢工人广泛采用快速炼钢法。不少工人一昼夜炼了四炉钢。萨坡罗什炼钢厂第十号平炉工人雅基曼科组，最近以五小时二十五分的时间炼一炉钢。
    苏联钢铁工业的成就是和社会主义制度的优越、工人的劳动积极性和技术的高超分不开的。一九五一年初，有效容积一千立方公尺以上的大高炉，在苏联占全部高炉容积的百分之五十一，而在美国只占百分之四十六；容量二百吨以上的大平炉在苏联占全部平炉容量百分之三十六，而在美国只占百分之十二。苏联钢铁工厂主要车间的费力操作过程几乎全部机械化了。它的钢铁生产主要过程的机械化水平占世界第一位，超过美、英、法等资本主义国家。在这个五年计划时期，苏联钢铁工业将实现从主要生产过程到辅助和修理过程的全盘机械化。自动化的水平也在提高。现在，苏联有百分之九十五的生铁和百分之八十七的钢是由自动化的高炉和平炉冶炼出来的。在这个五年计划时期，高炉的配料和称料的工作将自动化，高炉将装置测量炉顶灰尘数量的仪器；将制造测量在平炉炉槽中冶炼的金属的温度的器具；将提高轧钢机和轧钢管的机器全盘自动化的程度。
    苏联钢铁工人受到国家的极大关怀。他们的工资是各门工业中较高的，从一九四六年到一九五一年，有六十五万钢铁工人在各种形式的教育中提高了自己的技术水平。他们在这个五年计划中将得到建筑面积为五万平方公尺的新住宅。
    到一九五五年，苏联钢铁工业将达到一九二八年生产水平的十倍。为了完成和超额完成第五个五年计划，苏联钢铁工人正在努力充分利用现有设备，扩建企业，提高质量，增加产品种类，提高劳动生产率，节约原料、材料和减低生产成本。
