Introduction to the "New Typing Method"

The "New Typing Method" was developed based on a modified typeboard. It is primarily applicable to the new typeboard. Therefore, to use this new method, the old typeboard must be converted to the new typeboard.

Principles and Methods of Modifying the Typeboard

The principle of modifying the typeboard is to maximize the concentration of commonly used characters, strive to shorten the time for moving the carriage, and reduce the number of rarely used characters. The modification method is to disrupt the radical-based organization and adopt a "compound word radiation cluster" [Note] shape for arranging the characters on the typeboard. At the same time, the first, second, and third backup trays are also modified so that each character is placed in its proper location. In the future, if it is necessary to improve the typeboard to meet work needs without causing too much disruption, a basic typeboard table can be drafted first to fix all commonly used characters, and then a usage typeboard table can be rearranged based on the characters on the basic typeboard and the usage patterns in the work.

According to the above principles, the method of formulating the basic typeboard table and the first, second, and third backup tables is to carefully select characters first (commonly used characters, infrequently used characters, repeatedly used characters, missing characters, etc.), and concentrate them according to their respective transfer directions, then arrange them on the empty typeboard in the order of radicals according to the transfer directions, and finally check each character for omissions or duplications. During the process of modifying the typeboard, it is best to record the movement of character positions, which will be very useful for future typeboard modifications.

The method of formulating the usage typeboard table is: first, modify an empty typeboard according to the characters on the basic typeboard. When modifying, first select the most commonly used characters and place them in the center of the typeboard, and repeatedly adjust their positions according to the semantic connections of the characters to form a "compound word radiation cluster." Then, expand, merge, or connect outwards gradually according to the frequency of use.

After the usage typeboard table is finally determined, the usage typeboard is modified according to the typeboard table.

New Typing Method

The content of the new typing method mainly includes three aspects.

First, viewing the manuscript should not occupy key-pressing time. 1. Make full use of the time for typing compound words to view the manuscript. When the type hammer is stuck on the first character of a compound word, the eyes should not look at the second and third characters of the compound word, but should look at the characters above and below on the manuscript. The next character on each side, such as above, below, left, right, and diagonally, does not need to be looked at when typing, so that the hand does not stop after typing the compound word. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a habit that the eyes and hands can move simultaneously without interfering with each other; it is also necessary for the left hand to hold the typeboard handle firmly to prevent it from moving randomly to the left and right, so as to avoid pressing the wrong character. In order to make full use of the time for typing compound words to view the manuscript, it is very important to be proficient in typing compound words. For example, when typing "中国人民解放军" (Chinese People's Liberation Army), when typing the two characters "解放" (liberation), the eyes should turn to the manuscript, and by the time the two characters "解放" are typed, the characters below have also been viewed, and then the character "军" (army) and the characters just viewed below should be typed. This saves both time and effort. If the manuscript is not viewed when typing the two characters "解放", but is viewed when typing the character "军", the machine will often stop. 2. Strive to keep the machine running even when typing single characters. When the type hammer is stuck on a character that has not yet been typed, the eyes should look at the characters below; or when the carriage is being moved to another character position after typing the first character, the manuscript should be viewed; or the manuscript should be viewed when typing punctuation marks. Each time the manuscript is viewed should not be too long, preferably five or six characters. 3. In the continuous process of key-pressing, the eyes should lead the hands, i.e., look before typing. When the type hammer is stuck on the first character, the eyes should look at the second character on the typeboard; when the type hammer is stuck on the second character, the eyes should look at the third character on the typeboard. This can make the machine move in a straight line, maintain a normal speed, and also make the type hammer stick to the characters accurately and quickly. If there are three characters, the first character is on the upper tray, the second character is on the lower tray, and the third character is on the upper tray again. When the first character is stuck, the eyes should look at the third character. After the first character is typed, the eyes should turn to the second character. After the second character is typed, the third character can be easily found, avoiding the machine going back and forth and wasting time; some characters are often obscured when the hand is raised or lowered, and cannot be seen in advance, so one should look at the up-and-down movement of the hand to find them. 4. View the manuscript when pulling long distances. That is, view the manuscript while pulling the machine. For example, when typing the two characters "竞赛" (competition), after the character "竞" (compete) is stuck, the eyes can go to view the manuscript, and after the character "竞" is typed and the machine is pulled near the character "赛" (race), the eyes should turn to the typeboard to type the character "赛" and the characters below. 5. Use the time for pressing the horizontal and vertical trays, reversing the machine, and loading and unloading paper (loading paper refers to the time for loading the carbon paper and using the roller and pressing strip) to view the manuscript or find characters.

Second, the method of holding the handle with three fingers (index finger, thumb, middle finger), pressing down with wrist strength, lightly guiding and heavily striking, and combining two movements into one. Mastering the typing technique of "holding the handle with three fingers, pressing down with wrist strength, lightly guiding and heavily striking, and combining two movements into one" can improve work efficiency. However, if it is not mastered well, turning "combining two movements into one" into "rushing up suddenly"; turning "lightly guiding and heavily striking" into "heavily guiding and lightly striking" or "heavily guiding and heavily striking"; turning "pressing down with wrist strength" into "pressing down with the whole elbow"; turning "holding the handle with three fingers" into "gripping the handle tightly with three fingers" are all unacceptable. Because "rushing up suddenly" will damage the machine (if the top-character hook is not aligned with the typeboard comb hole, it will collide with the comb randomly and damage the typeboard comb), "heavily guiding and lightly striking" will make the typed documents unclear, "pressing down with the whole elbow" and "gripping the handle tightly with three fingers" cannot be sustained for a long time. "Holding the handle with three fingers" mainly uses the force of the index finger, with the thumb and middle finger playing a supporting role, to prevent the "handle" from moving randomly. When pulling the machine and pressing the characters, the three fingers should not grip too tightly (as long as the "handle" does not move randomly to the left, right, front, and back), otherwise it will be very tiring, but the index finger must press down with force (using the strength of the wrist, not the strength of the whole elbow), so that the strike will be powerful. "Lightly guiding and heavily striking" and "combining two movements into one" means that the force used when guiding the character should be small, and the strike should be fast, i.e., as soon as the type hammer locks the lead character, it should be struck forcefully immediately, so that the two actions of guiding and striking can be connected and the speed of the type hammer moving up and down can be accelerated; if force is applied when the type hammer is about to reach the platen, the type hammer will have no force when it goes up.

When using the above method, the following issues must be noted: the distance between the type hammer after it rises (without sticking to a character) and the platen is generally two centimeters (the mouth of the type hammer should be parallel to the printing mark), do not be too far or too close, otherwise the character will be unclear or smudged; the force of the "type hammer spring" should be slightly greater than the force of the "jump bar", but not too different; in order to make the operation convenient and effortless, the "handle" of the "down-pressing lever" can be appropriately lengthened (8.5 cm is more suitable), but it should not be too long, otherwise it will interfere with pulling the machine. In addition, the agility of the technique has a great impact on the speed. In the past, there was a technique of grabbing the handle with the whole hand and pressing down with the whole elbow, which was very tiring and could not be sustained for a long time; at the same time, because the movements were not agile and the two movements of guiding and striking could not be connected, the type hammer took about 0.8 seconds for each strike. Now, after switching to this technique, the type hammer is guided flexibly and strikes powerfully, and the type hammer only takes 0.5 seconds for each strike.

Third, other actions should also strive to shorten the time and strive to keep the key-pressing uninterrupted. This requires: 1. Move the machine in a straight line, do not pull it into an arc. And pull the machine quickly, both hands should cooperate at all times, do not pull it too far, do not turn randomly on the typeboard, and do not pull the machine empty or pull it into an arc. For example, if the two characters "摸索" (grope) are 50 spaces apart, pulling the machine in a straight line only takes 1.8 seconds, while pulling the machine in an arc takes 2.3 seconds. 2. Change lines while pulling the machine and viewing the manuscript. When one line is finished, change the line, view the manuscript, and push the machine to the next character position at the same time. This reduces the amount of pulling the machine, changes the line, and views the manuscript. 3. When changing pages of the original manuscript, move the manuscript press to keep the machine running, i.e., the left hand turns the manuscript and the right hand operates. When loading paper, load it correctly at once. If it is not loaded correctly, release the pressure strip and use the right hand to straighten the upper and lower ends of the paper, do not reload it. Do not press the "down-pressing ruler" too much on the loop either, to avoid wasting time on loading and unloading paper. 4. In order to facilitate viewing the manuscript at any time, sit up straight, do not bend the waist too much, and do not sit too straight. The eyes should not be too far or too close to the typeboard and the original manuscript. If it is too far, it is not easy to see the manuscript clearly; if it is too close, the range of characters that can be seen is small. Generally, it should be around 45 centimeters, so that the head and body will not move randomly with the machine, which will affect viewing the manuscript.

The above is the main content of the "New Typing Method." Because using the "New Typing Method" requires changing the old typeboard and the old rules, therefore, when using this method, especially when using it for the first time, it is necessary to memorize the typeboard, and remember the character positions above, below, left, and right of the compound words very clearly, so that the type hammer can be pulled over and pressed immediately. When typing, be bold and careful, prevent hesitation and panic, so as to achieve stability and accuracy, and improve work efficiency.

[Note] "Compound word radiation cluster" means taking one character as the core and radiating outwards. For example, take the character "指" (finger) as an example:

    “新打字操作法”介绍
   “新打字操作法”是在改装字盘的基础上研究出来的。它主要适用于新字盘。所以使用这新操作法，必须把旧字盘改装成新字盘。
    改装字盘的原则和方法
    改装字盘的原则是：最大限度地集中常用字，力求缩短拉动机身的时间和减少罕用字。改装办法是打乱部首规律，采用“复词放射团”〔注〕的形状装字盘。同时，也改装一、二、三备用盒，使每一个字都各得其所。以后如因适应工作需要，须改进字盘而又不致牵动太大，可以先拟定一个基本字盘表，把所有的常用字先固定下来，然后再根据基本字盘上的字和工作中的使用规律重排成使用字盘表。
    根据上述原则，制定基本字盘表和一、二、三备用表的方法，是先缜密地选字（常用字、非常用字、重复用字、缺字等），并按照各个字转移的方向分别集中起来，再依转移方向按部首次序在空盘上进行排列，最后逐字检查有无遗漏或重复情形。在改装字盘的过程中，最好把字位移动情况登记下来，这对以后改装字盘很有用处。
    制定使用字盘表的办法是：首先，根据基本字盘上的字，在一个空盘上改装。改装时先选择最常用的字，放在字盘中央，根据文字的联系性，反复调动位置，组成“复词放射团”。再按照使用程度，逐渐向外扩展、合并或衔接。
    使用字盘表经最后确定后，即按照字盘表改装使用字盘。
    新打字操作法
    新打字操作法的内容主要有三。
    第一，看稿不占用打键时间。一、充分利用打复词的时间看稿。当字锤卡住某一复词的第一字时，眼即不看该复词的第二、第三字，而去看稿上下面的字，复词的上下左右斜等各边的下一字可不必看着打上，使得打完该复词后，手仍不停顿。要做到这点，必须养成眼、手能同时动作而互不牵制的习惯；也必须使左手紧握字盘把手，不使它左右乱动，以免按错字。为了充分利用打复词的时间看稿，熟练打复词的动作很重要。如打“中国人民解放军”时，打到“解放”两字，眼即转向稿台，待“解放”两字打完，下面的字也已看完，即再接着打“军”字和下面刚看的字。这样既省时、又省力。如果在打“解放”两字时不看稿，打到“军”字时再看，就往往会停了机子。二、在打单字时看稿也力求机子不停。当字锤卡住某一字还没有打上的时候，眼即看下面的字；或者在打完第一字，当把机身向另一字位拉动时看稿；或者在打标点时看稿。每次看稿不宜太长，以五、六个字为宜。三、在连续的打键过程中，应该是眼到手随，即先看后打。当字锤卡准第一字后，眼看字盘上的第二字；当字锤卡第二字时，眼又看字盘上的第三字。这样能使机子直线移动，保持正常速度，也能使字锤卡字卡得准、卡得快。如有三字，第一字在上盘，第二字在下盘，第三字又在上盘，当卡上第一字，眼即看第三字，第一字打完后，眼即转向第二字，待第二字打完后，第三字很容易便可找到，免得机子往返，浪费时间；有的字往往被手抬起或压下时遮住，不能预先看到，这就应该看手的起伏情况去找。四、拉长距离时看稿。即一面拉机子，一面看稿。如打“竞赛”二字，卡上“竞”字后眼即可去看稿，等“竞”字打完，并把机子拉到“赛”字附近，眼即转向字盘去打“赛”字和下面的字。五、利用按横、纵盒，倒机子，上、下纸（上纸指复写纸上好后，利用卷滚筒、按压条时间）时间看稿或找字。
    第二，三指（食指、母指、中指）握柄、腕力下压，轻引重打、两动贯一的手法。掌握“三指握握柄、腕力下压，轻引重打、两动贯一”的打字手法，能够提高工作效率。但如果掌握不好，把“两动贯一”变成“猛一下上去”；“轻引重打”变成“重引轻打”或“重引重打”；“腕力下压”变成“全肘下压”；“三指握柄”变成“三指紧握柄”，都是不合要求的。因为“猛一下上去”会损坏机子（顶字钩没有对准字盘篦子孔，即会乱撞盘篦，把字盘篦子顶坏），“重引轻打”会使打出的文件看不清楚，“全肘下压”和“三指紧握柄”就不能长久坚持工作。“三指握柄”主要是食指用力，母指、中指起配合作用，不使“执手柄”乱动。在拉机子和按字的时候，三指不宜握得过紧（只要“执手柄”不左右前后乱动即可），否则很吃力，但食指要用力下压（用手腕的力量，不要用全肘的力量），这样打上去才有力量。“轻引重打”和“两动贯一”是指引字时用力要小，打要快，即当字锤把铅字卡准后，马上就要用力打上，这样才可以把引、打两个动作连贯起来，加快字锤上下的速度；如果当字锤快到卷纸筒时再用力，字锤上去就没有力了。
    使用上述手法时必须注意下列问题：字锤升上
  （不卡字）后距卷纸筒一般是二糎（字锤口与印字标要成平行），不要离得过远或过近，否则会使字不清楚或扣戳；“打字锤簧”的力量比“跳杆”的力量稍大一点即可，不能相差太远；为使操作方便、省力，可适当把“下压杆”的“接把”接长一些（以八点五糎较适宜），但也不能太长，否则会妨碍拉动机子。另外，手法敏捷对速度的影响很大。过去有一种手法是满手抓柄，全肘下压，打起来很吃力，不能长久坚持；同时因为动作不敏捷，引、打两动不能连贯，所以字锤下一次约需零点八秒。现在改用这种手法后，使字锤引字灵便，打上去有力，字锤上下一次只需零点五秒。
    第三，其他动作也要力求缩短时间，力求打键不停。这就要求：一、直线移动机子，不要拉成弧形。并且拉机子要快，两手在任何时候都应该配合，既不要拉过火，又不要在字盘上乱转，更不要拉空机子或拉成弧形。如“摸索”两字相距五十格，直线拉机只需一点八秒，而弧形拉机则需二点三秒。二、边换行，边拉机子，边看稿。在一行打完时，一面换行，一面看稿，同时把机子推向下一字位上去，这样既少拉了机子，也换了行，又看了稿。三、原稿换页时，移动压稿器力求机子不停，即左手翻稿，右手操作。上纸时要一下上正，如上不正时，即应把压条放开，用右手把纸上下端扭正，不要再重上。套圈也不要压“下压尺”太多，以免上下纸浪费时间。四、为适应随时看稿方便，坐的姿势要端正，腰不要太弯，也不要太直。眼睛距字盘和原稿不宜太远和太近，太远了不易看清稿子，太近了看字的范围就小，一般是在四十五公分左右，这样才不致使头及身子随机子乱动而影响看稿。
    以上是“新打字操作法”的主要内容。因为使用“新打字操作法”要改变旧的字盘，旧的规律，因此，在使用这一方法特别在最初使用时，必须熟记字盘，把复词上下左右的字位都要记得非常清楚，以使字锤拉过去马上即可按上。在打字时，要大胆、细心，防止犹豫、慌乱，这样才能做到稳、准，提高工作效率。
    〔注〕“复词放射团”，即以一字为核心，向外放射。现举“指”字为例：
