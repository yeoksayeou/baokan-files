Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Issues Instructions on Winter Training Work; Liaodong Province Winter Training Instructor Training Class Begins

    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently issued instructions on the 1953 winter training work for basic construction departments. The instructions require Party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over winter training work. It was also decided that this year's winter training should focus on training grassroots management cadres and Party-masses work cadres; political education and professional and technical education should also be conducted for engineering and technical personnel and the vast number of permanent workers, respectively. The instructions stipulate that the main content of political education during winter training should be the general line of our country during the transition period, the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, and relevant policies and tasks related to basic construction. Professional and technical education should be carried out for different types of work such as civil engineering and construction, metal structure, electromechanical installation, construction machinery, and engineering geological exploration, using methods such as on-site demonstrations and learning by doing. When conducting technical education, it is necessary to summarize and promote advanced experiences of decisive significance, and especially to earnestly learn from advanced Soviet experiences. The instructions require Party committees in various localities to make full preparations and strive to concentrate efforts in batches to begin winter training after the completion of basic construction work.

    Furthermore: In order to do a good job in this year's winter training work in the construction sector, Liaodong Province recently established a Winter Training Committee, with the Deputy Secretary of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC serving as the Director, and the Deputy Director of the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau serving as the Director of the Winter Training Office. In order to train winter training cadres, the Winter Training Committee recently transferred more than 300 outstanding cadres from various basic construction units to establish a winter training instructor training class, which opened on November 5th. After half a month of training, these cadres will be assigned to various construction units to serve as winter training instructors or counselors.

    中共中央东北局发出冬训工作指示
    辽东省冬训教员训练班已经开学
    中共中央东北局最近发出一九五三年基本建设部门冬季训练工作指示。指示要求所属各级党委加强对冬季训练工作的领导。并决定今年的冬训工作要把基层管理干部和党群工作干部作为训练重点；对工程技术人员和广大固定工人，也应分别进行政治教育和业务技术教育。指示规定以我国在过渡时期的总路线、第一个五年计划的基本任务和有关基本建设的政策和任务为冬训政治教育的主要内容。业务技术教育应按土木建筑、金属结构、机电安装、施工机械、工程地质钻探等不同工种，分别采用实地表演、边讲边做等办法进行。在进行技术教育时，要总结和推广有决定意义的先进经验，特别要认真学习苏联先进经验。指示要求各地党委作好充分准备，争取在基本建设收工后，就分批集中，开始冬训。（新华社）
    又讯：辽东省为了办好今年建筑部门冬季训练工作，日前已成立了冬训委员会，由中共辽东省委副书记担任主任委员，由省建筑工程局副局长担任冬训办公室主任。为训练冬训干部，冬训委员会最近已从各基本建设单位抽调了三百多名优秀干部，成立了冬训教员训练班，并已于十一月五日开学。这批干部经半个月的训练，将被分派到各建设单位担任冬训教员或辅导员的职务。
