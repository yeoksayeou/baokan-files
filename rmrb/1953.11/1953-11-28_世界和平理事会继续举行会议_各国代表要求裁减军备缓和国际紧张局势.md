    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 27th - According to TASS, the World Peace Council continued its meeting on the 25th.

    At the morning session, Iranian representative Professor Nafisi, in his speech, detailed the struggle of the people of the Middle East for independence. He emphasized that the Iranian people would never agree to join an anti-Soviet pact, saying: We will never forget the Soviet Union's actions in safeguarding Iran's security; a treaty guaranteeing our independence and sovereignty links our two peoples together.

    World Peace Council Vice-Chairman D'Arboussier, who spoke next, pointed out that the people of Black Africa oppose the arming of West Germany and support the demands of the European people for the maintenance of peace and international security. He finally emphasized: The people of Black Africa will fully support the heroic struggle of the French people against the "European Defense Community" plan.

    Soviet representative A. Surkov spoke. Surkov said: Whenever the public discusses how to ease the current international tensions, the issue of striving for disarmament and banning weapons of mass destruction will inevitably be raised, because the rapid development of the arms race caused by international tensions itself becomes a constant force for exacerbating international tensions; the same is true of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Surkov pointed out that the responsibility for intensifying the arms race should be attributed to the US-UK bloc. All the plans formulated by the US and UK in the United Nations have always been permeated with a spirit of insincerity and a desire to evade frank suggestions on the issue of disarmament. The same is true of the new US proposal recently put forward at the United Nations General Assembly in the name of the French delegation.

    Surkov briefly explained the Soviet Union's proposals on banning weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. He pointed out that although the Soviet Union now possesses atomic and hydrogen bombs, it will continue to demand the banning of such weapons. He said: In order to ease international tensions, we are willing to make all reasonable concessions on a mutual basis to promote the cause of peace. We are willing to reach an agreement, but we do not accept anyone's arbitrary decisions.

    Surkov finally pointed out that if organized world public opinion could bring the five major powers to a round-table conference and enable the governments concerned to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, it would pave the way for resolving other issues that are currently causing international tensions.

    French representative Eugénie Cotton, in her speech, pointed out that the people's protest movement has brought the Korean War to an end, and it must also bring the Vietnam War to an end and prevent West Germany from becoming a new breeding ground for European war. At the same time, the people of all countries can and must force their governments to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, for progress, and for the well-being of mankind.

    Norwegian representative Rosenquist, Swedish representative André Andreen, and Canadian representative James Endicott spoke successively. Rosenquist suggested that the World Peace Council call on scientists of all countries not to engage in research work aimed at producing atomic weapons, germ weapons, and chemical weapons; André Andreen demanded that resolute action be taken to ban atomic and germ weapons in order to save the future of the world. Endicott called on the world peace movement to make further efforts to force governments to agree to an unconditional ban on weapons of mass destruction. Endicott said that the Canadian Peace Congress has presented a program to the government, demanding that a conference of representatives of major powers be held to discuss and resolve major international disputes.

    Polish representative Iwaszkiewicz said that public opinion in European countries is focused on the peaceful resolution of the German question. He called on peace advocates in all countries of the world to support progressive forces in West Germany against aggressive policies. He said: Poland will welcome the establishment of a unified Germany that is a guarantee of European peace and a factor in Germany's obtaining an appropriate place in the family of free nations.

    At the afternoon session, Danish representative Forchhammer expressed his support for convening a major power conference to peacefully resolve international problems. Albanian representative Musalai and Bulgarian Professor Nadjakov stated that the Albanian and Bulgarian peoples oppose the arming of West Germany and accused the United States of threatening world peace by establishing bases and stationing troops on foreign territories.

    French representative Madelle demanded that the US government ratify the Geneva Protocol stipulating the ban on bacteriological warfare.

    British representative Feagin said that the British people are increasingly aware that the Cold War policy harms their own interests and damages Britain's economic position. Ordinary people in all countries know from experience that the Cold War can be stopped through major power agreements and the easing of international tensions.

    Indian representative Indulal Yagnik said that the Indian people are deeply concerned about maintaining peace. He pointed out that US imperialism is attempting to drag India into its sphere of influence and is attempting to establish military bases in French and Portuguese territories in India and in Pakistan, which is hostile to the Soviet Union, China, Arab countries, and primarily hostile to India itself. He finally pointed out that India's patriotic movement to defend freedom and peace is constantly growing, and the friendly relations between India and China, the Soviet Union, and other countries are constantly strengthening.

    German writer Anna Seghers pointed out that the enemies of peace are sparing no effort to disrupt the peaceful life of the German Democratic Republic. She called on all peace fighters to firmly support the establishment of a unified Germany that does not threaten European peace and the security of neighboring countries in accordance with democratic principles.

    世界和平理事会继续举行会议
    各国代表要求裁减军备缓和国际紧张局势
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会二十五日继续举行会议。
    在上午会议上，伊朗代表纳菲西教授在发言中详细叙述了中近东人民争取独立的斗争。他强调指出：伊朗人民决不会同意参加反苏公约，他说：我们永远不会忘记苏联维护伊朗安全的行为，一个保证我们独立和主权的条约把我们两国人民联系在一起。
    接着发言的世界和平理事会副主席达波赛指出：黑非洲人民反对武装西德，支持欧洲人民关于维护和平与国际安全的要求。他最后强调说：黑非洲人民将全力支持法国人民反对成立“欧洲防务集团”计划的英勇斗争。
    苏联代表阿·苏尔科夫发言。苏尔科夫说：公众每讨论如何缓和目前国际紧张局势的问题时，必然会提出争取裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器，因为国际紧张局势所引起的军备竞赛的飞速发展，它本身又变成加剧国际紧张局势的经常动力，关于原子武器和氢武器，道理也是一样。
    苏尔科夫指出：加紧扩军备战的责任应该归于美英集团，美英方面历来在联合国中所拟订的一切计划，都渗透着一种不诚恳的精神和规避对裁军问题提出坦白的建议的愿望。最近在联合国大会上以法国代表团名义提出的美国新建议也是这样。
    苏尔科夫简单地说明了苏联关于禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备的建议。他指出：苏联虽然现在已掌握了原子弹和氢弹，但将继续要求禁止这种武器。他说：为了缓和国际紧张局势，我们愿意在相互的基础上作一切合理的让步来促进和平事业。我们愿意达成协议，但不接受任何人的独断决定。
    苏尔科夫最后指出：假使有组织的世界舆论使五大国举行圆桌会议，使有关政府在裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器问题上达成协议，将为解决现在造成国际紧张局势的其他问题铺平道路。
    法国代表欧仁妮·戈登在发言中指出：人民的抗议运动已使朝鲜战争结束，它还必需使越南战争结束，并阻止西德变成新的欧洲战争的温床。同时，各国人民可以而且必须迫使他们的政府使用原子能来为和平目的、为进步、为人类的幸福服务。
    挪威代表罗森科伊斯特、瑞典代表安德烈·安德琳、加拿大代表文幼章先后发言。罗森科伊斯特建议世界和平理事会号召各国科学家不要从事于目的在于生产原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器的研究工作；安德烈·安德琳要求采取坚决行动来禁用原子武器和细菌武器，以挽救世界的前途。文幼章号召全世界和平运动进一步努力，来迫使各国政府同意无条件禁止大规模毁灭性武器。文幼章说，加拿大和平大会向政府提出了一项纲领，要求举行大国代表会议，以讨论解决重大的国际争端。
    波兰代表伊瓦希凯维兹说：欧洲各国的公众舆论都集中注意德国问题的和平解决。他号召世界各国的和平拥护者支持西德进步力量反对侵略政策。他说：波兰将竭力欢迎建立一个统一的德国，这是保障欧洲和平与德国在自由国家大家庭中取得适当地位的因素。
    在下午会议上发言的丹麦代表福希哈默表示赞成召开大国会议来和平解决国际问题。阿尔巴尼亚代表穆萨莱和保加利亚代表纳德热科夫教授表示阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚人民反对武装西德，并指责：美国在外国领土建立基地、驻扎军队，威胁了世界和平。
    法国代表马戴尔要求美国政府批准规定禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。
    英国代表费金斯说：英国人民越来越认识到冷战政策损害了他们自己的利益，损害了英国的经济地位。各国普通人民从经验中知道，通过大国协议和国际紧张局势的缓和，就能停止冷战。
    印度代表印杜拉尔·雅克尼说：印度人民十分关怀维护和平。他指出：美帝国主义企图把印度拉入他们的势力范围，并企图在法国和葡萄牙在印度的属地和在巴基斯坦建立军事基地，这是敌视苏联、中国、阿拉伯国家、首先是敌视印度本身的。他最后指出，印度保卫自由与和平的爱国运动在不断壮大，印度和中国、苏联和其他国家的友好关系正不断加强。
    德国作家安娜·西格斯指出：和平的敌人在不遗余力地扰乱德意志民主共和国的和平生活。她号召所有的和平战士坚决支持按照民主的方针，成立一个统一的、不威胁欧洲和平与邻国安全的德国。
