Introducing the 43rd Issue of the Chinese Edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"

The 43rd issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Cultivating and Educating Party Activists." The editorial points out that Party activists are the most politically mature, most active, most solid, and most experienced segment of the Communist and Workers' Parties. They are the reflectors of opinions within the Party and the communicators of Party resolutions. As people's democratic countries develop along the socialist path, various sectors of the national economy and state administrative organs require a large number of outstanding cadres, and Party activists are an inexhaustible reserve force for cadres. Holding meetings of Party activists is an important method for cultivating and educating them. Such meetings are schools for educating cadres with Marxism-Leninism and effective ways to mobilize Party members to implement Party resolutions. To cultivate and educate Party activists, it is also necessary to consult with them on major issues in political and economic life, and to keep them informed of all the work of the Party committee at all times. As long as the Party's leading organs are good at guiding them, Party activists are a great force capable of creating miracles.

Important articles in this issue include: "The Communist Party of Germany Fights for a Peaceful, Democratic, and United Germany" by Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany; "The French People Fight for Peace and Against the Ratification of the Bonn and Paris Military Treaties" by Florimond Bonte, Member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party; "The Deals of the Greek Royal Fascists and American Militarists" by Kostas Koligiannis, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece; and "The Peace Movement in Brazil is Growing Stronger" by Jorge Amado, Vice-Chairman of the Brazilian Peace Defense Committee.

Reimann's article states that the German people see the German Democratic Republic as a solid fortress in the struggle for the reunification of the country on a democratic basis. The most important tasks of the workers, peace-loving people, and all patriots in West Germany are: they must not allow the Bonn and Paris treaties to be ratified, they must take action to oppose any measures by the Adenauer group to deepen the division of Germany, and they must take on the cause of promoting mutual understanding among Germans. The article outlines the program of the Communist Party of Germany for the reunification of the country and discusses aspects of ideological work within the Party that need to be strengthened in the future.

Bonte's article summarizes the French people's struggle for peace since June of this year, and points out that the forces participating in the struggle against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties exceed the forces that are currently participating in the national peace movement. On this basis, the broadest unity of patriotic forces in France who love peace is being established. Therefore, it is entirely possible to prevent the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties in France.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十三期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第四十三期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“培养和教育党的活动分子”为题发表社论。社论指出，党的活动分子是共产党和工人党中政治上最成熟、最积极、最巩固、最有锻炼的部分，他们是党内舆论的反映者，是党的决议的传达者。在人民民主国家沿着社会主义的道路发展的时候，国民经济的各个部门和国家行政机关都需要大批的优秀干部，党的活动分子就是干部的无穷无尽的后备军。为了培养和教育党的活动分子，举行党的活动分子会议是一个重要的方法，这种会议是用马克思列宁主义教育干部的学校，是动员党员群众执行党的决议的有效办法。为了培养和教育党的活动分子，还必须和他们商量政治和经济生活中的重大问题，随时使他们明了党委员会的全部工作。只要党的领导机构善于指导他们，党的活动分子就是能够创造奇迹的巨大力量。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：德国共产党主席马·雷曼的“德国共产党为和平、民主和统一的德国而斗争”，法国共产党政治局委员弗·皮佑的“法国人民争取和平，反对批准波恩和巴黎军事条约”，希腊共产党中央委员会政治局委员科·科利阿尼斯的“希腊保皇法西斯分子与美国军国主义者的交易”，巴西保卫和平委员会副主席若·亚马多的“巴西的和平运动日益发展壮大”。
    雷曼的文章说，德国人民把德意志民主共和国看作争取全国在民主基础上重新统一的斗争的坚固堡垒。西德的工人、爱好和平的人们和所有的爱国者的头等重要的任务就是：他们决不容许波恩和巴黎条约获得批准，他们必须用行动来反对阿登纳集团加深德国分裂的任何措施，他们必须把促使德国人互相了解的事业担当起来。文章概述了德国共产党争取全国重新统一的纲领，并谈到了党内思想工作今后需要加强的方面。
    皮佑的文章综述了法国人民今年六月以来争取和平的斗争，并指出，参加反对批准波恩和巴黎条约的斗争的力量，超过了现在已经参加全国和平运动的力量。在这种基础上，法国爱好和平的爱国力量的最广泛的团结，正在建立起来。因此，阻止波恩和巴黎条约在法国批准是完全可能的。
