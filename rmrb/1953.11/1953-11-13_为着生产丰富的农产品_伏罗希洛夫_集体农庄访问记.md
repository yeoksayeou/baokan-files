    For Rich Agricultural Production
    ——Visiting the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow  Li He

    Just one month after the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee issued its decision on further developing agriculture, a resolute voice calling for efforts to realize the Party's call is resounding everywhere from cities to villages in the Soviet Union. On October 21st, we visited the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm in the Ukhtomsky District of the Moscow Region. The same scene was unfolding there.

    The "Voroshilov" Collective Farm was formed in 1950 by merging three collective farms, and in 1951, two more collective farms were incorporated. The collective farm's 486 collective farm households, including 586 laborers, own 900 hectares of land, including 418 hectares of cultivated land and 73 hectares of orchards (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese Mu). This is not considered a large collective farm in the Soviet Union. It engages in vegetable, potato, and livestock farming, and its production is very good. It has been a "millionaire" for many years, with a cash income of 5,200,090 rubles last year.

    About 80 percent of the collective farm's cultivated land is planted with vegetables and potatoes, irrigated by four water pumps. Water used by the city of Moscow and factories is transported here for use through an 11-kilometer-long pipeline. It has 560 square meters of greenhouses and 9,400 hotbed frames, growing early-maturing vegetables. Its potato and vegetable yields increase year by year. Last year, it harvested 177 quintals of potatoes per hectare (1 quintal equals 200 Chinese Jin), and an average of 318 quintals of vegetables per hectare. This year, it harvested 200 quintals of potatoes per hectare, early-maturing cabbage – 415 quintals, carrots – 700 quintals, onions – 110 quintals, cucumbers – 110 quintals, tomatoes – 400 quintals, late-maturing cabbage – 7 to 8 quintals (approximate, not yet fully harvested), table beets – 250 quintals, and fodder beets and sugar beets – 700 quintals.

    This collective farm already has two cattle farms and three pig farms, raising 301 head of cattle (including 168 cows), 850 pigs, as well as 200 sheep, 1,000 rabbits, and 2,000 poultry. The stables house 136 horses. Now, it has achieved an average of 24 cows per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture, with an average milk yield of 3,987 liters per cow, and obtained 8.6 tons of meat per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture last year, and 10 tons of meat this year.

    From these agricultural product yields, we can see that the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm has exceeded the national standards that Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report and the decision of the Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee as necessary to achieve (ten cows per 100 hectares, with each cow producing 2,500 to 2,600 kilograms of milk; produce 2.7 tons of meat from every 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture, and at least 3 tons of pork from every 100 hectares of cultivated land. 1954 production targets: potato yield of 140 quintals per hectare, cabbage – 175 quintals, cucumbers – 110 quintals, tomatoes – 135 quintals, onions – 85 quintals, carrots – 120 quintals, and table beets – 130 quintals.)

    However, the members of the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm are not complacent with their existing achievements. The chairman of the collective farm, Hero of Socialist Labor I.S. Morozov, told us that the farm has taken a series of new measures to produce rich agricultural products and to ensure the supply of more vegetables, potatoes, milk, and meat to the residents of the capital. He also took us to visit the farm's newly undertaken capital construction and cattle and pig sheds.

    Not far from the farm's management department, a 1,000-square-meter greenhouse is being built with bricks, and in front of the greenhouse, 2,500 hotbed frames are being constructed with concrete. These buildings have been under construction for a month and will be completed before the October Revolution Day this year. Originally, the farm relied on its existing greenhouses and hotbeds to continuously produce vegetables from April to November. The new greenhouses and hotbeds will enable production even during the period from December to March. In this way, the supply of vegetables will be guaranteed throughout the year.

    The farm's leadership usually attaches great importance to agronomy. It often sends farm members to advanced farms to learn new experiences, pays attention to new things published in the newspapers, and is careful to promote new initiatives within the farm. For example, last year the farm prepared two million mud blocks (not containers) of peat and humus for this year, which were used to grow seedlings of cauliflower, early-maturing cabbage, and tomatoes. It selected early, healthy seedlings. Therefore, it supplied Moscow City with vegetables earlier than even the southern farms: cauliflower in May, carrots, onions, and early-maturing cabbage in June.

    Now, the farm is making even more preparations for agronomy. It is preparing to use excellent varieties for 100 percent of all crops. For example, using potatoes grown in peat soil as seeds, because the moisture and temperature of the peat soil are relatively stable, the potatoes grow very uniformly. We saw such potatoes in the two newly built potato warehouses of the farm, each capable of storing 450 tons. They were all about the size of eggs. The farm is using this seed to strive to increase the potato yield to 300 quintals per hectare in the future. The farm cultivates its own vegetable seeds. Its experience proves that self-cultivated seeds yield the highest harvests. It guarantees that by 1955, the seeds it cultivates will not only be enough for its own use, but also can be supplied to neighboring farms.

    The farm plans to further increase labor productivity, because the crops it grows are labor-intensive, and its manpower is insufficient. The machine tractor station uses seven tractors for its cultivation, replacing two-row drilling with four-row drilling. The farm will increase the area of square drilling of vegetables and square cluster planting of potatoes; it will increase organic fertilizers and granular mineral fertilizers; the seedlings of square-drilled vegetables will be carried with mud blocks of peat and humus.

    The farm's cultivated land area is not large, so it must highly utilize land fertility. It will widely adopt intercropping methods: planting cauliflower between rows of late-maturing cabbage, when the cabbage leaves grow large, the cauliflower has already budded and does not need sunlight; before planting tomatoes, utilizing the land to plant radishes and Chinese cabbage; first planting rye and pasture on the land where potatoes are to be planted. This guarantees two harvests from the land.

    The farm will not increase the number of livestock, but it wants to increase livestock products, so it must increase feed production. We saw its newly built cattle sheds, the mechanized feed kitchen that has been installed, and the cement silage storage. Several silage storages are using one percent salt to pickle 900 tons of carrots, corn, sunflowers, oats, and cabbage. These silage and sufficient pasture guarantee the increase in milk and other livestock product yields.

    The farm has expanded its apple orchard this year. It plants 50,000 apple and pear saplings every year, utilizing the gaps between the trees. It will develop swamp land, striving to expand the total area of the orchard to 150 hectares by 1955.

    The construction of agricultural production development in the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm, like other collective farms, is progressing rapidly. The new greenhouses and hotbeds cost 2.5 million rubles, the new cattle sheds cost 3.5 million rubles, and the renovation of the potato warehouse cost 1 million rubles. It has newly built silage storages and manure storage. It has begun to build a mobile pumping station on the Moscow River and has begun to install artificial rainfall equipment.

    In addition to responding to the Party's call, the high production enthusiasm of the members of the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm and other collective farms is also due to the encouragement measures of the Soviet Communist Party and the government. This farm used to deliver 590 tons of potatoes and 1,050 tons of vegetables to the state at procurement prices; this year, only 29 tons of potatoes and only 39 tons of vegetables were delivered. Previously, the procurement price of early-maturing potatoes was 36 rubles per ton, now it has been increased to 250 rubles. This year, the farm sold 560.5 tons of semi-potatoes to the state at purchase prices, which are 20 percent higher than the procurement prices. This year alone, the farm has increased its extra income by 200,000 rubles from supplying potatoes and vegetables to the state, and increased its extra income by 460,000 rubles from supplying goods to the state.

    This collective farm has already earned 4.5 million rubles in the first eight months. The state has given it a loan of 2 million rubles. Coupled with the strong savings of previous years, it is able to carry out large-scale capital construction.

    The new agricultural tax also brings many encouragements to collective farmers. The Avlosin family, members of the farm, have a quarter of a hectare of private plot, raising a cow, earning several thousand rubles a year from here. Last year, his family paid 1,464 rubles and 80 kopecks in taxes. The business situation has not changed this year, the agricultural tax paid has been reduced to 826 rubles, and next year it will be reduced to 400 rubles. His family's cow produces more than 4,000 liters of milk every year, last year 252 liters were handed over to the state, this year it has been reduced to 183 liters, and next year only 110 liters will be handed over. After the implementation of the new agricultural tax, the economy on the private gardens of collective farmers has also been further developed.

    This collective farm has five shops in the Moscow market, selling its own agricultural products. It has a contract with the state milk administration to supply the capital with 115 tons of milk a year. It plans to add five trucks to its collection at the end of the year with the income from milk, so it will have a total of 17 trucks and two cars.

    In the "Voroshilov" Collective Farm, we not only feel the solid foundation of the Soviet vegetable, potato, and livestock industry, but also see the epitome of its rapid and powerful development.

    为着生产丰富的农产品
    ——“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄访问记
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    苏联共产党中央九月全会关于进一步发展农业的决定发布不过一个月，从苏联的城市到农村，到处沸腾着为实现党的号召而努力的坚决的声音。十月二十一日，我们访问了莫斯科州乌赫托木斯基区“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄。那里也呈现同样的情景。
    “伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄是在一九五○年由三个集体农庄合并成的，一九五一年又有两个集体农庄并入。这个集体农庄的四百八十六户集体农民，包括五百八十六个劳动力，拥有九百公顷土地，其中耕地四百十八公顷、果园七十三公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）。这在苏联不算是大的集体农庄。它所经营的是蔬菜、马铃薯和饲畜业，生产很好，多年来都是“百万富翁”，去年现金收入达到五百二十万零九千卢布。
    这个集体农庄约百分之八十耕地种的是蔬菜和马铃薯；用四架抽水机灌溉。莫斯科市和工厂使用过的水，经过十一公里长的水管运到这里利用。它已有五百六十平方公尺的温室和九千四百个温床柜架，种着早熟的蔬菜。它的马铃薯和蔬菜的收获量，一年年增加。去年每公顷马铃薯收获一百七十七公担（一公担合二百市斤），每公顷蔬菜平均收获三百十八公担。今年每公顷马铃薯收获了二百公担，早熟白菜——四百十五公担，胡萝卜——七百公担，洋葱——一百一十公担，黄瓜——一百一十公担，番茄——四百公担，晚熟白菜——七、八公担（约数，还没有收完），食用甜菜——二百五十公担，饲料甜菜和制糖甜菜——七百公担。
    这个集体农庄已有两个牛场、三个猪场，喂养着三百零一头牛（其中一百六十八头是母牛）、八百五十条猪，还有二百只羊、一千只家兔、二千只家禽。马厩里养着一百三十六匹马。现在，它已做到平均每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场有二十四头母牛，平均每头产牛奶三千九百八十七公升，每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场去年得到八点六吨肉类，今年得到十吨肉类。
    从这些农产品产量中，我们看到了，“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄已经超过了赫鲁晓夫同志报告和苏联共产党中央全会决议中所指出的必须达到的全国标准（每一百公顷要有十头母牛，每头母牛产牛奶二千五百到二千六百公斤；从每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场生产二点七吨肉类，每一百公顷耕地至少生产三吨猪肉。一九五四年生产任务：每公顷马铃薯收获量一百四十公担，白菜——一百七十五公担，黄瓜——一百一十公担，番茄——一百三十五公担，葱——八十五公担，胡萝卜——一百二十公担，食用甜菜——一百三十公担。）
    但是“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄庄员没有以已有的成就自满。集体农庄主席、社会主义劳动英雄伊·斯·马罗佐夫告诉我们，农庄为生产丰富的农产品，为保证供给首都居民更多的蔬菜、马铃薯、牛奶、肉类，采取了一系列的新措施。他并且带我们参观了农庄新进行的基本建设和牛舍猪舍。
    离农庄管理部不远的地方，用砖盖起一座一千平方公尺的温室，在温室前面用混凝土筑着二千五百个温床柜架。这些建筑物已进行一个月，在今年十月革命节前完工。本来农庄依靠原有的温室温床，已经从四月到十一月经常不断地生产着蔬菜。新的温室温床将使从十二月到三月的期间也能生产。这样，将全年保证蔬菜的供应。
    农庄的领导平常就很重视农艺。它常常派庄员到先进的农庄去学习新的经验，留心报纸上发表的新的事物，注意推广本庄内新的创议。例如，去年农庄为今年准备了二百万个泥炭与腐植土的泥块（不是容器），用来种花菜、早熟白菜和番茄的菜秧。它选种的是早期的、健康的菜秧。所以它比南方农庄还早供应莫斯科市以蔬菜：五月出花菜，六月出胡萝卜、洋葱和早熟白菜。
    现在，农庄为农艺进行着更多的准备。准备所有作物百分之百地用优良品种。例如，用泥炭地长的马铃薯作种子，因为泥炭地的水分和温度比较稳定，马铃薯长得很整齐。我们在农庄新近建筑的两个各能储存四百五十吨的马铃薯仓库内，看到了这样的马铃薯。它们个个像圆蛋一样大小。农庄用这个种子，争取将来提高马铃薯的收获量到每公顷三百公担。农庄自己培育了各种蔬菜种子。它的经验证明：自己培育出来的种子收获量最高。它保证到一九五五年时所培育的种子，不但够自己用，而且可以供应邻近农庄。
    农庄计划进一步提高劳动生产率，因为它所种的作物是费劳动的，它的人手是不够的。机器拖拉机站用七台拖拉机为它耕作，用四行点播代替二行点播。农庄将增加方形点播蔬菜和方形簇种马铃薯的面积；将增加有机肥料和粒状矿质肥料；在方形点播的菜秧上带着泥炭和腐植土的泥块。
    农庄耕地的面积不大，所以还要高度利用地力。它将广泛地采用夹种的办法：在晚熟的白菜行间种上花菜，当白菜叶子长大时，花菜已经含苞，不需阳光；在种番茄以前，利用土地种水萝卜和小白菜；在种马铃薯的土地上，先种黑麦和牧草。这样保证土地有两次收获。
    农庄将不增加牲畜的头数，但要增加畜产品，所以要增产饲料。我们看到它新建的牛舍、已经安装好的机械化的饲料厨房、水泥的青饲库。几个青饲库用百分之一的盐腌着九百吨胡萝卜、包谷、向日葵、燕麦和白菜。这些青饲和充足的牧草，保证着牛奶和其他畜产品产量的提高。
    农庄今年已扩大了苹果园。它利用园间隙地每年种着五万株苹果和梨树苗。它将开发泥沼地，争取到一九五五年扩大果园总面积到一百五十公顷。
    “伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄发展农业生产的建筑，正如其他集体农庄一样，进行得很快。新温室温床用了二百五十万卢布，新牛舍用了三百五十万卢布，改建马铃薯仓库用了一百万卢布。它新建了青饲库、贮粪库。它开始建筑莫斯科河上活动的抽水站，开始装置人工降雨设备。
    除了响应党的号召以外，“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄和其他集体农庄庄员这种高度的生产积极性，也由于苏联共产党和政府的鼓励措施。这个农庄过去以交售价格交给国家的马铃薯达五百九十吨，蔬菜达一千零五十吨；今年马铃薯只二十九吨，蔬菜只三十九吨。以前早熟的马铃薯的交售价格是每吨三十六卢布，现在提高到二百五十卢布。今年农庄以购买价格卖给了国家五百六十吨半马铃薯，比交售价格高百分之二十。它今年仅从供给国家的马铃薯和蔬菜上面就增加了二十万卢布的额外收入，从供给国家的商品上增加了四十六万卢布的额外收入。
    这个集体农庄在头八个月中已经收入了四百五十万卢布。国家给它二百万卢布的贷款。加上往年雄厚的积蓄，它能够进行大规模的基本建设。
    新的农业税也带给集体农民许多鼓励。农庄庄员阿甫洛辛家有四分之一公顷的宅旁园地，养着一头母牛，每年从这里收入几千卢布。去年他家纳税一千四百六十四卢布八十哥比。今年经营的情形没有改变，所纳的农业税减低到八百二十六卢布，明年将减低到四百卢布。他家的母牛每年产牛奶四千多公升，去年交给国家二百五十二公升，今年减到了一百八十三公升，明年将只交一百一十公升。新农业税实行后，集体农民私人园圃上的经济也有进一步的发展。
    这个集体农庄在莫斯科市场上有五个铺子，经售自己的农业品。它和国家的牛奶总管局订有合同，一年供给首都一百十五吨牛奶。它准备在年底用牛奶的收入添置五辆卡车，这样它总共将有十七辆卡车和两辆小汽车。
    在“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄，我们不仅感觉到苏联蔬菜、马铃薯和饲畜业的基础的雄厚，而且看到了它迅速地强大地发展的缩影。
