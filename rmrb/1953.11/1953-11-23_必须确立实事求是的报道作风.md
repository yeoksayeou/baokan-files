It Is Imperative to Establish a Realistic Reporting Style
Dong Qian

What do our newspapers rely on to educate and guide the people forward? It is facts and truth. Therefore, "news must be completely truthful" has always been an excellent tradition of Party newspapers and a principle commonly observed by Party newspaper staff for many years. To implement this principle, our Party conducted systematic education among all Party newspaper staff during the rectification movement in 1945. During the anti-bureaucracy struggle this year, many localities, while opposing false reports, also carried out a struggle against false reporting among newspaper cadres. After these struggles and education, the vast majority of comrades have been able to conduct reporting work realistically based on this principle. However, because the ideological style of a very small number of reporters in some newspapers has not been completely transformed, or because the editorial department has neglected the education of reporters, some untrue news reports still appear in the newspapers from time to time. Although such untrue reports account for only a very small number of the thousands of news items, and such reporters account for only a very small number of the thousands of reporters, this has become a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated today, when the prestige of our newspapers among the people is rising.

Of course, completely fabricated and purely fictitious untrue news reports are a minority within a minority. Judging from some of the false reports that have emerged since the anti-bureaucracy struggle, there are still people or events involved. The problem is that these so-called "events" do not reflect the true essence of objective things, but are merely based on certain phenomena of things, reluctantly fabricated by reporters into "typical examples," or attributing Zhang San's affairs to Li Si, and concentrating them into "typical examples." The report "Summer Harvesting and Planting in the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative" written by Zhang Dafang, assistant reporter of Henan Daily, published on June 5th, and the photo of members of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative carrying out seedling replanting taken by Xie Yanhua, assistant photography reporter of the newspaper, published on June 10th, are two relatively obvious examples of this in recent times.

In the report "Summer Harvesting and Planting in the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative," assistant reporter Zhang Dafang described the "harvesting and planting simultaneously" of the Lushan Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative as follows: "... some [members - editor's note, hereinafter the same] are rolling wheat and threshing, some are delivering manure and plowing; because of the drought and no rain, some labor force is also drawn to pull water carts to water the land and carry out drought-resistant planting." However, the real situation is not as described by Zhang Dafang. The time interval between plowing and watering the land was very long. The enthusiasm of the members for "harvesting and planting simultaneously," "because of the drought and no rain," was not so high. Moreover, after the members tried "harvesting and planting simultaneously" and failed, they changed the plan of "harvesting and planting simultaneously." The "harvesting and planting simultaneously" plan of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative was formulated before the wheat harvest (May 9th). When the wheat harvest began, it was drought in Lushan. Although the cooperative plowed two and a half mu of wheat land and planted corn, it "dried up and bounced," and no seedlings emerged. It was then decided to change the "harvesting and planting simultaneously" plan and wait until the harvest was completed before planting to resist drought. However, according to the revelation of reader Yang Hengshan and the recent investigation by the Henan Daily editorial department in Lushan, assistant reporter Zhang Dafang did not understand or was unwilling to understand this actual situation when he interviewed the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative. He just felt that only harvesting wheat without combining it with plowing and planting did not conform to the spirit of the provincial party committee's "harvesting and planting simultaneously." The "model cooperative" should implement the plan of harvesting and planting simultaneously and play a leading role among the masses. At the same time, it also interrupted his plan to report on "harvesting and planting simultaneously." Therefore, he subjectively believed that the cooperative should not change the "harvesting and planting simultaneously" plan. More seriously, in order to complete his reporting plan, Zhang Dafang even adopted an attitude that a reporter should not have, and forced Su Dianxuan and Tan Tianyu, the cadre stationed in the cooperative, to act according to his personal opinions. Zhang Dafang first said to them in an affirmative tone: "The plan of harvesting and planting simultaneously that you originally formulated is very in line with the spirit of the provincial party committee's instructions. Now that you are a model cooperative, you should play a leading role among the masses!" Su Dianxuan replied: "The land is too dry to plant, and the members' thinking is not clear." Zhang Dafang did not add any consideration at this time and said: "Let's not talk about the members, what do you think yourself?" Su Dianxuan felt that "the reporter was asking about his thinking" and was not good at saying anything more. Tan Tianyu quickly changed the subject and said: "Let's try plowing it!" Then Tan Tianyu mobilized the plowman and said: "What if you can't plow? The newspaper reporter is asking your uncle's thinking, let's plow a few mu and try it!" Su Dianxuan also had to persuade the plowman, and after discussion at the cadre meeting, it was decided to "try plowing it." As a result of the trial plowing with two plows, only five mu were plowed in two days, and plows and other tools were also damaged. The plowman believed that the land was too dry, and both people and animals could not bear it. The next afternoon, he put away the plow and went home. That night, the cooperative held another general meeting of members to specifically discuss it. Everyone expressed dissatisfaction with plowing, so it was decided not to plow any more, but to harvest wheat and thresh first. It was not until the later stage of wheat harvest that drought-resistant planting gradually unfolded in the cooperative. This is the true picture of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative implementing the "harvesting and planting simultaneously" plan, and it is also the true picture of Zhang Dafang giving ideological pressure to the cadres, thereby actually causing forced plowing.

Zhang Dafang's approach not only violates the principle that news must be completely truthful, but also exceeds the scope of responsibility of a Party newspaper reporter. The responsibilities of a Party newspaper reporter mainly lie in going deep into the masses, conducting investigation and research, discovering problems, writing reports that can solve problems, and using the persuasiveness of their reports to influence the masses. They should never interfere in local work or "issue orders" to local cadres. Zhang Dafang cannot say that he does not fully understand this, but why did he do such a thing? That is because he still has the view of catering to superiors and simply completing tasks in his reporting thinking. This is manifested in the fact that although he does not dare to fabricate things out of thin air, he believes that giving cadres ideological pressure based on policies, and having cadres create typical examples that meet their own wishes, and using these "typical examples" to "promote" the entire Henan province, will be of great benefit to the implementation of the Party committee's "harvesting and planting simultaneously" instructions, or to the completion of individual reporting plans. As for whether the examples created in this way are considered typical, what conditions must be met to realize and promote them, whether the effect of implementation is good or bad, what impact such reports will have on the prestige of the Party and the newspaper, etc., it seems that there is no place for these in Zhang Dafang's reporting thinking.

Reporters' reporting thinking should not only start from the Party's policies, but also from the objective existence and the masses' conscious actions to implement the Party's policies. The two are indispensable. Lacking any aspect, the reporting thinking will become "empty talk," and the reported facts will inevitably be untrue.

In reporting thinking, Zhang Dafang's approach of reluctantly creating typical examples just to have people and events, is certainly very improper. But assistant photography reporter Xie Yanhua's approach of simply putting Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head just because there are people and events objectively, is also quite bad. When Xie Yanhua took photos of seedling replanting in the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative, the cadre had already told him that "the seedlings have been replanted, only the tobacco seedlings have not been replanted." However, he did not care and said, "It is also possible to take a supplementary photo, this is not difficult!" When Wang Wenzhu, the vice president of the cooperative, and others led him to take photos, he also told him that "This is the land of bamboo craftsman Chen Yuxiang [that is, the photo published in the newspaper's pictorial], next to our cooperative's land." And asked, "Where to take the photo?" At this time, Xie still did not add any consideration and said: "It's okay to take photos in any land!" Obviously, this is a deliberate mistake. Not only did he know that "the seedlings have been replanted," but also knew that it was "the land of bamboo craftsman Chen Yuxiang," but he still repeatedly asked the cadres to take photos and falsely reported that it was the seedling replanting of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative. This act of mixing things up is not accidental, but is inseparable from his understanding that news photos can be taken casually. It should be pointed out that news photos, like news reports, must be completely truthful. It is different from literary works or filmmaking. Literary works, on the basis of reflecting real life, fully allow authors to process, imagine and create. Some film productions also allow supplementary shots. But news photos or news reports are not allowed, and the facts reported must be completely accurate. The characteristics and advantages of news reports lie in the fact that all its details are based on facts. "The requirements for the accuracy of news manuscripts are special and extremely rigid." (Bluntman: On News Reporting) This is a major point that distinguishes news reports from literary works and news photos from film production. Recognizing this difference and recognizing the responsibilities of a reporter are of great significance for overcoming the current untrue phenomena in news reports or improving the ideological style of reporters.

Of course, to completely overcome the current untrue phenomena in news reports, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of reporters from the leadership of the editorial department, and overcome the idea of being satisfied with reporters "completing tasks." Taking the issue of Zhang Dafang and Xie Yanhua's false reports as an example, according to the inspection letter from the Henan Daily Editorial Committee, Zhang Dafang's reporting style of being unwilling to go deep into the masses, conduct investigation and research, and humbly learn from the masses, is the result of his more serious subjectivism, weak mass viewpoint, and task viewpoint of reporting for the sake of reporting. Xie Yanhua's reporting style of being unwilling to go deep into life, being lazy and opportunistic, and being extremely reckless and careless, is the result of his ideological style of not being hard-working and in-depth in daily work, and being satisfied with superficial achievements. The editorial department did not pay enough attention to these shortcomings in their ideological style in the past, often only requiring "completion of tasks" when reporters went down, and being satisfied with reporters "completing tasks" after reporters reported a few articles. As for how to complete the tasks, what problems there are in the work, etc., they rarely intervened. Under this circumstance, the free and undisciplined style of some reporters and the "empty talk" reporting style cannot be quickly corrected. Therefore, the Henan Daily Editorial Committee believes in its letter that they should also review this point. In order to learn from the lessons of this incident, in addition to sending people to conduct on-site investigations and ordering Zhang Dafang and Xie Yanhua to make written reviews, they also issued a notice on this matter to educate all staff in the editorial department to establish the concept that news must be completely truthful and a realistic reporting style.

It must also be pointed out that untrue news reports and improper reporting styles are very harmful to the prestige of the Party, especially Party newspapers, among the masses. Taking the false reports of Zhang Dafang and Xie Yanhua as an example, according to the reflection of reader Yang Hengshan, when Zhang Dafang forced the cooperative to plow dry land, the members were very dissatisfied and said: "The reporter moves his mouth, and the members tire their legs!" After their reports and photos were published in the newspaper, many members shouted: "It's all fake!" This shows that untrue news reports have aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. It is worth noting that in the news reports of many newspapers, there are also more or less of this untrue phenomenon. Therefore, overcoming the phenomenon of untrue news and correcting the dishonest reporting style of reporters should not be regarded as a small problem, a newspaper problem, but a principled problem that is directly related to the interests of millions of people, and every newspaper editorial department should put it on the agenda.

    必须确立实事求是的报道作风
    董谦
    我们的报纸依靠什么来教育和引导人民群众前进呢？这就是靠事实，靠真理。因而，“新闻必须完全真实”，在多年来就一直是党报工作的优良传统和党报工作人员共同遵守的原则。为贯彻这一原则，一九四五年整风运动时，我们的党曾在全体党报工作人员中进行过一次系统的教育；今年反官僚主义斗争中，不少地方与反对假报告同时，在报社干部中又进行了反对假报道的斗争。经过这些斗争和教育，绝大多数同志已能够根据这一原则，来实事求是地进行报道工作了。但由于某些报社还有极少数记者思想作风未得到彻底改造，或由于编辑部忽视了对于记者的教育，因而，一些不真实的新闻报道，仍然在报纸上时有出现。尽管这种不真实的报道，在千万条新闻中只占极少数，这样的记者在千百个记者中也是占极少数，可是，在今天我们的报纸在人民群众中的威信日益高涨的情况下，就成为一个严重的、必须革除的缺点。
    当然，在一些不真实的新闻报道中，完全凭空捏造、向壁虚构的还是少数中的少数。据在反官僚主义斗争以后出现的一些假报道来看，都还有其人或有其事。问题是，这些所谓的“事”，并没有反映出客观事物的真实本质，而仅仅依据事物的某种现象，经记者勉强制作而成为“典型”，或者把张三的事算在李四账上，而集中成为“典型”。河南日报在六月五日发表的该报助理记者张大方所写“夏收夏种在苏殿选农业生产合作社”的通讯，和六月十日发表的该报助理摄影记者谢延华所拍的苏殿选农业生产合作社社员进行补苗的照片，就是最近期间这样两个比较明显的例子。
    在“夏收夏种在苏殿选农业生产合作社”的通讯中，助理记者张大方曾对鲁山苏殿选农业生产合作社的“边收边种”作了这样的描述：“……一部分
  （社员——编者注，下同）进行碾麦打场，一部分进行送粪犁地；因为天旱不雨，又抽出一部分劳动力拉水车浇地，进行抗旱播种。”可是，真实的情况并不如同张大方所描述的；犁地与浇地的时间距离很长，社员“边收边种”的情绪，“因为天旱不雨”，不但没有那么高涨，而且经社员试行“边收边种”失败后，就改变了“边收边种”的计划。苏殿选农业生产合作社的“边收边种”计划，是在麦收前（五月九日）制订的。麦收开始时，正值鲁山天旱，该社虽犁了二亩半大麦地，种上玉米，但“地蹦干”，没有出苗，便决定改变“边收边种”计划，等收割完再抗旱点种。可是，据读者杨恒珊来信揭发，以及河南日报编辑部最近在鲁山调查的结果表明，助理记者张大方到苏殿选农业生产合作社采访时，并不了解也不愿意去了解这一实际情况，只是感到光收麦不结合犁种，不符合省委“边收边种”的精神，“劳模社”应当执行边收边种计划，在群众中起带头作用；同时，也打断了他报道“边收边种”的计划，因而便主观地认为该社不应该改变“边收边种”计划。更严重的是，张大方为了完成自己的报道计划，竟然采用一个记者不应有的态度，勉强苏殿选和驻社干部谭天育按照他个人的意见行事。张大方首先即以肯定的语气对他们说：“你们原订的边收边种计划，非常合乎省委指示的精神。现在你们作为一个劳模社，应该在群众中起带头作用！”苏殿选答复说：“地太干不能种，社员的思想也不通。”张大方这时还不加任何考虑地说：“先不说社员，你自己觉得怎么样？”苏殿选感到“记者追问思想”，不好再说什么。谭天育便赶快转话头说： “犁下试试吧！”随后谭天育即动员掌犁的说： “不能犁怎办？报社记者在问你大（叔父）的思想哩，先犁几亩试试吧！”苏殿选也不得不去说服掌犁的，并经干部会议讨论，决定“犁下试试”。两犋牛试犁的结果，两天只犁了五亩，还犁坏犁铧等工具。掌犁的认为地太干，人和牲口都受不了，第二天下午便收犁回家。当晚该社又召开了社员大会来专门讨论，大家对犁地纷纷表示不满，于是又决定不再犁地，还是先收麦打场。直至麦收后期，抗旱点种工作才在该社逐渐展开。这就是苏殿选农业生产合作社执行“边收边种”计划的事实真象，也是张大方给干部以思想压力，从而在实际上造成强迫犁地的事实真象。
    张大方的这种作法，不只违背了新闻必须完全真实的原则，而且超越了党报记者的职责范围。党报记者的职责，主要在于深入群众，调查研究，发现问题，写出能够解决问题的报道，用自己的报道的说服力来影响群众，绝不应该去干涉地方工作，向地方干部“发号施令”。这一点，张大方不能说完全不了解，但为什么他又作出这样的事呢？那就是因为他在报道思想上还存在着迎合上级和简单完成任务的观点。这就表现在，他虽不敢公然无中生有，但却认为根据政策给干部施以思想压力，经过干部制作出符合自己愿望的典型事例，并以这一“典型”来“推动”河南全省，这样对贯彻党委“边收边种”指示，或完成个人报道计划，都会有很大好处。至于这样制造出来的事例算不算典型，把它实现和推广起来要具备什么条件，实行的效果是好还是坏，这样报道出去对党对报纸的威信又将有何种影响，等等，似乎在张大方的报道思想里，都是没有位置的。
    记者的报道思想，不仅要从党的政策出发，而且要从客观的存在和群众自觉地贯彻党的政策的行动出发。二者是缺一不可的。缺少任何一方面，报道思想就会成为“客里空”，报道的事实也就必然会不真实。
    在报道思想上，像张大方只为有其人有其事，而不惜勉强制作典型的作法，固然很不正派；但像助理摄影记者谢延华只以在客观上有其人有其事，竟然把张三的帽子戴在李四头上的作法，也是相当恶劣的。谢延华在苏殿选农业生产合作社拍补苗照片时，干部已告诉他“苗已补完，只有烟苗还没有补种”。可是，他毫不介意，说“补拍一张也可以，这并不困难！”当该社副社长王文聚等人领他去拍照时，又告诉他说“这是竹匠陈玉祥的地
  （即刊登在该报画刊上的那张照片），跟咱社的地挨着。”并问“在哪里拍？”这时谢仍不加考虑地说：“随便在哪块地里拍都行！”很显然，这是一种明知故犯的错误。他不但知道“苗已补完”，而且知道那是“竹匠陈玉祥的地”，可是他依然三番两次地要求干部去拍照，并假报为苏殿选农业生产合作社的补苗。这种张冠李戴的作法并不是偶然的，而是和他对于新闻照片可以随便补拍的认识分不开的。应该指出，新闻照片和新闻报道一样，必须完全真实，它和文学作品或拍制电影还有所不同。文学作品在反映现实生活的基础上，是完全容许作者加工、想像和创造的；有些电影的拍制也是容许补拍镜头的。但对新闻照片或新闻报道却是不能许可的，它所报道的事实必须完全准确无误。新闻报道的特点和优点，就在于它全部细节都是以事实为基础。“对于新闻稿件的准确性的要求是特殊的、极硬性的。”（布朗特曼：论新闻报道）这就是新闻报道不同于文学作品、新闻照片不同于电影拍制的一个主要之点。认清这一个区别以及认清一个记者的职责，对于克服目前新闻报道中不真实的现象，或改进记者的思想作风，都是具有重要意义的。
    当然，要彻底克服目前新闻报道中不真实的现象，还须从编辑部的领导方面加强对记者的教育，和克服满足于记者“完成任务”的思想。就以张大方和谢延华作假报道的问题来说，据河南日报编辑委员会来信检查说，张大方不肯深入群众、调查研究、向群众虚心学习的报道作风，就是他较严重的主观主义、群众观念不强和为报道而报道的任务观点发展的结果；谢延华不肯深入生活、偷懒取巧和极端轻率粗忽的报道作风，就是他在日常工作中不够艰苦深入、满足于表面成绩的思想作风发展的结果。对于他们这些思想作风上的缺点，编辑部在过去并没有引起足够的注意，往往是在记者下去时只要求
  “完成任务”，在记者报道几篇后，又满足于记者 “完成任务”。至于如何完成任务，在工作中有什么问题，等等，却很少过问。在这种情况之下，有些记者的自由散漫作风和“客里空”的报道作风，就不能迅速得到纠正。因而，河南日报编辑委员会来信认为，在这一点上，他们也是应该检讨的。为接受这一事件的教训，他们除派人进行实地调查并责成张大方、谢延华作出书面检讨外，并为此事发出通报，教育编辑部全体工作人员确立新闻必须完全真实的观念和实事求是的报道作风。
    还必须指出，不真实的新闻报道和不正派的报道作风，对于党特别是党报在群众中的威信，是有很大的损害的。以张大方、谢延华这次的假报道为例，据读者杨恒珊反映，当张大方勉强该社犁干地时，社员就很不满意地说：“记者动动嘴，社员累坏腿！”及至他们的报道和照片在报纸上发表后，很多社员又嚷着说：“净是假的！”这说明不真实的新闻报道已经引起群众的不满。值得注意的是，在不少报纸的新闻报道中，也或多或少地存在着这种不真实的现象。因此，克服新闻不真实的现象，改正记者不老实的报道作风，就不能当作是一个小问题、一个报纸的问题，而是直接关系到千百万群众的利益，和每一个报纸的原则性的问题，每一报纸编辑部都应把它列在议事日程上。
