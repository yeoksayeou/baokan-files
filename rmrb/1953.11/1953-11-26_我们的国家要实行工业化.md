Our Country Must Implement Industrialization
Li Pu

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has embarked on a new path, which is the path of gradually transitioning to socialism. This road is quite long and cannot be completed in a few years. During these many years, the people of our country must work together under the leadership of the Communist Party to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization, and gradually realize the country's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. This is our general line and general task for the transition to socialism. When these things are done step by step, our country will transition to socialism and become a socialist industrial power.

First, let's talk about industrialization. What is national industrialization? What is socialist industrialization? Why should we implement industrialization? What are the benefits of industrialization for farmers?

I. What is National Industrialization, and What is Socialist Industrialization

The meaning of national industrialization is to transform our country from an industrially underdeveloped country into an industrially developed country.

Industry (excluding handicrafts here) is the production of various things using machines. Industry produces a great variety of things. Walking plows, fertilizers, water pumps, sprayers, kerosene, cloth, glass, needles, soap, sugar... are all industrial products, and steel pipes, steel plates, lathes, boilers, wires, generators, trains, automobiles, airplanes, tractors... are also industrial products. Industrial products are numerous, good, and cheap, and many things cannot be made by hand. With industry, agriculture can also develop; without industry, agriculture cannot develop, the country cannot be strong, and the people's lives cannot be prosperous. This is how China was in the past.

To make industry developed, the most important thing is to be able to manufacture various machines. With machines, factories can be opened. It is also necessary to produce more steel. Without steel, machines cannot be made. It is also necessary to produce more coal and electricity. Without coal and electricity, steel cannot be smelted, machines cannot be made, and the machines in the factory cannot be turned on for production. It is also necessary to produce more oil, because many machines are powered by gasoline and kerosene, such as cars, airplanes, and tractors, which cannot move without gasoline and kerosene. In addition, the chemical industry, which produces various chemicals, is also very important. The steel industry, the defense industry, the kerosene industry, and many other important industries cannot do without the chemical industry.

A country where industry produces more than agriculture is called an industrial country; a country where agriculture produces more than industry is called an agricultural country. Our China is still an agricultural country. Until last year, industrial products only accounted for more than 20% of the total output of our country, while agricultural products still accounted for more than 70%. We still cannot manufacture many important machines, as well as things like automobiles, airplanes, and tractors. Steel, kerosene, electricity, and coal are also still very scarce. Therefore, industrializing our country is a long-term matter.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan began to be implemented in 1953. The mines and factories that our country currently has are not only too few, but also too small and too old. During these five years, we will expand and renovate a number of old mines and old factories, and also open many new mines and build many new factories. We will open iron mines and build steel mills, open copper mines and build copper smelting plants, open coal mines, open kerosene mines, build oil refineries, and also build power stations, machine manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, cement plants, farm tool plants, fertilizer plants, textile mills, pharmaceutical plants, and many other factories. The Soviet Union has promised to do its best to help us build 141 large projects. Each project includes many factories. Some have already started construction, and some are in preparation. In addition to these large mines and large factories, we will also build hundreds of other mines and factories. By 1957, when the first Five-Year Plan is completed, especially by 1959, when all of the large projects that the Soviet Union is helping us build are completed, our country's industry will have a great foundation. We will have much more steel, kerosene, electricity, and coal than we do now, and we will be able to make our own cars, tractors, and various machines.

It is not a simple matter to build so many large mines and large factories in such a short time. First of all, the mines must be found. Now there are thousands of people looking for mines in many places across the country. After the mines are opened, foundations must be laid and materials bought to build factories. Some large projects take several years, requiring tens of billions or hundreds of billions of catties of grain worth of money to build. In some places, railways must be built in advance in order to transport machinery and various building materials in, and to transport the produced goods out. A large factory or mine now requires thousands or tens of thousands of people to build, and in the future will require thousands or tens of thousands of people to produce. In these five years alone, we will need hundreds of thousands of technical cadres, and even more technical workers. Ordinary workers and staff are not even included in this calculation. This means that since we want to build mines and factories, we have to recruit workers, recruit students, set up institutions, build houses, build roads, build electric lights, telephones, tap water, sewers, expand cities, increase cities... In short, for industrialization, we must use many people and a lot of money to do these things. Now the Central People's Government and major cities across the country are busy with these things all day long. When we were fighting the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek in the past, we were busy fighting all day long. Now it is almost the same as fighting, but we are fighting the construction battle, the industrial battle.

Our industrialization is also called socialist industrialization. Why is it called socialist industrialization?

This means that the mines and factories we are building belong to all the people of the country, not to a small number of capitalists. If, like the capitalist countries in the United States and Britain, factories and mines are allowed to be run by capitalists, the more developed the industry, the more the working people will suffer, because capitalists run factories only to exploit the working people and make money for themselves. Our country is a country where the masses of the people are the masters. Mines and factories belong to the state, which means they belong to all the people. The mines and factories run by the state are for the benefit of all the people, so they are called socialist industries. Not only are the newly built industries socialist industries, but also the industries and handicrafts that are now privately owned will gradually become socialist industries. Developing industry in this way is called socialist industrialization.

II. Why Should We Implement Industrialization

There are two main reasons why we must implement industrialization.

First, only by implementing industrialization can our country become rich and strong, and the people's lives can become better and better.

To make the country rich and strong and the people's lives good, the most important thing is to produce more things. When industry is developed, the country can produce large quantities of various things to supply the people according to the needs of the people. When industry is developed, everyone can have a job, a fixed income, and can continuously improve their lives. Industry can also help agriculture develop, so agricultural products will definitely become more and more, and farmers' incomes can also continue to increase. If our country can make its own trains, automobiles, and ships, transportation can also be further developed, and industrial and agricultural products can be transported faster and cheaper. When the people are rich, the country will be rich, and the country can set up more schools, hospitals, theaters, and cinemas, and develop cultural education and health undertakings. In this way, the lives of the people across the country can become better and better.

In the past, our country was poor and weak, and was always bullied by imperialism, because of reactionary politics and the inability of industry to develop. After liberation, imperialist countries still want to bully us, so they occupied our Taiwan and invaded Korea. After our country is industrialized, not only can the people's lives be improved, but we can also make our own airplanes, tanks, and cannons, and we will have greater strength to defend our peaceful life.

Second, only by implementing industrialization can we simultaneously implement the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce.

Socialism cannot be separated from industry. The industry operated by the state is not only a model of socialism, but also the main force for implementing socialist transformation. With a strong socialist industry, that is, the state produces more things itself, there can be a strong socialist commerce; with a strong socialist industry and commerce, that is, industry and commerce that does not exploit people is developed, there is the power to lead, restrict, and transform capitalist industry and commerce; if capitalist industry and commerce still refuse to be transformed and still exploit workers and peasants for profit, then they will only be eliminated.

Small peasants and handicraft workers who work independently are not capitalists and are not exploiters. But relying on their own strength alone, they cannot go to socialism, but will instead go to capitalism. Only when the country's industry is developed, capable of providing farmers with various new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery, helping farmers organize production cooperatives, and using other various industrial products to exchange for farmers' agricultural products, can they lead farmers away from the small-peasant economy and capitalism, and embark on the road to socialism. The transformation of handicrafts is also the same. In the future, some handicraft workers can organize handicraft production cooperatives to produce according to the state's processing and ordering plans, and some handicraft workers can enter state-owned factories. Therefore, the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts also depends on the leadership of the state's socialist industry, and also depends on the state's industrialization.

III. What are the Benefits of National Industrialization for Farmers

The state's socialist industrialization can make the country strong and the people rich, and can enable our country to gradually transition to socialism. It can be seen that this matter is of great benefit to the people across the country, and of course it is also of great benefit to the farmers across the country. Now let us look specifically from the perspective of farmers to see what the benefits of industrialization for farmers are.

First of all, when industry is developed, the state's need for grain, cotton, and other agricultural products will increase. At the same time, the state will also be able to use greater force than in the past to help the development of agricultural production. When agricultural production is developed and the purchase of agricultural products increases, farmers' incomes will increase. This is a natural principle.

Secondly, when industry is developed, the state will be able to use more, better, and cheaper walking plows, animal-drawn farm tools, waterwheels, chemical fertilizers, various pesticides, and sprayers to supply farmers, and in the future, it will also be able to use tractors and other agricultural machinery to help farmers. With these things, farmers can not only greatly increase and guarantee the production of their main business, but also free up their hands to greatly develop various sideline productions, and the heavy laborious labor can also be reduced step by step.

Third, when industry is developed, more water conservancy construction can be carried out, more reservoirs can be built, and more large dikes and sluices can be built. Not only can water and drought disasters be avoided, but also dry land can be turned into paddy fields and sandy land can be turned into fertile fields. In some places, ships can also pass through in the future, electricity can be generated, and rural prosperity can be promoted.

Fourth, when industry is developed, the state can build more railways and highways, build more trains, automobiles, ships, rubber-tired carts, bicycles, and other transportation tools. The exchange of materials between urban and rural areas will be smoother, and farmers' incomes and the supply of industrial products to rural areas can be increased.

Fifth, when industry is developed, the state will gradually become rich, and will gradually reduce the prices of industrial products (which is actually increasing farmers' incomes), and will jointly use more force with rural cooperatives to do various good things for farmers, such as increasing the supply of daily-use industrial products to rural areas, absorbing more farmers' children into secondary schools and above, setting up more rural cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and issuing more agricultural loans.

Also, when industry is developed, factories, mines, railways, and various institutions in cities will need to continuously increase workers and staff. Some of the surplus labor force in rural areas can be transferred to cities in a planned and organized way according to the needs of the country, which can also reduce expenditures and increase income for farmers' families.

In short, to transform agricultural production and improve farmers' lives, industrialization is essential. Farmer representatives from our country who visited the Soviet Union personally witnessed the great benefits of socialist industrialization for farmers. They saw that many rural areas in the Soviet Union were connected to railways and highways, and many rural areas were almost the same as cities, with roads, buildings, electric lights, telephones, middle schools, hospitals, cinemas, and parks. In collective farms, machines can be used for everything from plowing, sowing, weeding, fertilizing, and pest control to harvesting, threshing, and even digging beets, picking cotton, milking cows, and shearing sheep. Soviet farmers eat, wear, live, and use things that are much better than ours. It will of course not be a matter of one or two years for our country to become like the Soviet Union, but it will take ten to twenty or thirty years. However, in the past few years, because our country's industry has already begun to develop somewhat, our country's farmers have already received several benefits as mentioned above. Although these benefits vary in different places, they can be counted one by one. The more developed the socialist industry, the more benefits farmers can get. In the future, when industrialization is realized and the country transitions to socialism, the benefits that farmers will get will be even greater.

Some farmers say: Industrialization is good, but I am afraid it will increase the burden on farmers. This idea is wrong. The country's industrialization construction does require a lot of money. For the sake of the country's prosperity and the farmers' own interests, it is entirely appropriate for farmers to bear some burden. This is like how, in order to harvest grain in the autumn, seeds must be sown and fertilizer must be applied in the spring. However, the burden on farmers will not increase, because the funds needed for industrial development are mainly accumulated by the working class through production. Therefore, the agricultural tax in 1952 was slightly lower than in 1951. This year, the Central People's Government has decided to stabilize the total amount of agricultural tax at the 1952 level in the next three years, that is to say, in these three years, no matter how production develops, farmers will still pay public grain according to the quantity that their land should produce in a normal year, according to the tax rate, and the increased part will be entirely owned by the farmers themselves. On the other hand, if there are serious disasters, farmers can receive care in the form of reductions or exemptions from public grain according to the laws of the country.

However, since industrialization is such a great cause and has such great benefits for the country and the farmers, it should of course not be the sole responsibility of the working class. Farmers number in the hundreds of millions across the country and have a long revolutionary history. They should of course actively participate in such a major event as industrialization, especially by striving to increase production, develop mutual assistance and cooperation, and sell the agricultural products needed by the country to the country. We will discuss these aspects in detail later.

### 我们的国家要实行工业化

    编者按：本报从今天起陆续发表“向农民宣传总路线”的一批文章。这批文章可以用作农村工作干部学习总路线的材料，也可供农村工作干部向农民作宣传的材料。
    我们的国家要实行工业化
    李普
    从中华人民共和国成立起，我们的国家就走上了一条新的大路，这就是一步一步过渡到社会主义去的大路。这条路相当长，不是几年工夫走得完的。在这许多年里面，我们全国人民要在共产党的领导下一齐努力，一步一步地实现国家的社会主义工业化，一步一步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造。这就是我们向社会主义过渡的总路线总任务。把这些事一步一步办完了，我们的国家就过渡到了社会主义，变成了一个社会主义的工业强国。
    先来讲工业化。什么叫做国家工业化？什么叫做社会主义工业化？为什么要实行工业化？工业化对农民有什么好处？
  一、什么叫做国家工业化，什么叫做社会主义工业化
    国家工业化的意思，就是要把我们的国家由一个工业不发达的国家，变成一个工业很发达的国家。
    工业（这里不包括手工业）就是用机器生产各种东西。工业生产的东西多得很。步犁、肥田粉、抽水机、喷雾器、煤油、布匹、玻璃、针、肥皂、白糖……都是工业生产品，钢管、钢板、车床、锅炉、电线、发电机、火车、汽车、飞机、拖拉机……也是工业生产品。工业生产的东西又多又好又便宜，很多东西是手工造不了的。有了工业，农业也能发达；没有工业，农业也不能发达，国家也不能强盛，人民生活也不能富足。我们中国过去就是这样。
    要使工业发达，最要紧的就是要能多造各种机器，有了机器，才能开工厂。又要能多炼钢铁，没有钢铁，机器就造不成。还要能多产煤和电，没有煤和电，就不能炼钢，不能造机器，不能把工厂里的机器转动起来进行生产。还要能多炼油，因为好多机器是靠汽油和煤油来发动的，比如汽车、飞机和拖拉机，没有汽油和煤油一步也走不动。此外，生产各种化学品的化学工业，也非常重要，钢铁工业、国防工业、煤油工业和其他许多重要的工业，都离不了化学工业。
    一个国家的工业出产的东西比农业多，就叫工业国；农业出产的东西比工业多，就叫农业国。我们中国现在还是一个农业国。直到去年，我们全国出的十成东西里面，工业出的东西还只占到两成多，农业出的还占着七成多，有许多要紧的机器，还有汽车、飞机、拖拉机这些东西，我们还不能制造，钢铁、煤油、电力、煤炭这些东西也还少得很。所以，使我国工业化是一件长期的事。
    我国的第一个五年计划在一九五三年开始实行了。我国现在有的矿山和工厂，不但太少，而且太小太旧。在这个五年里面，我们要扩大和改建一批旧矿山、旧工厂，还要开许多新矿山，办许多新工厂。我们要开铁矿、办炼钢厂，要开铜矿、办炼铜厂，要开煤矿，开煤油矿，办炼油厂，还要建设电力站，办机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、水泥厂、农具厂、肥田粉厂、纺织厂、制药厂和许多别的工厂。苏联答应尽力帮助我们建设一百四十一项大工程，每一项工程里面都包括许多个厂子，有的已经动工了，有的正在做准备工作，除了这些大矿山和大工厂之外，我们还要建设几百个别的矿山和工厂。到了一九五七年，第一个五年计划完成的时候，特别是到了一九五九年，苏联帮助我们建设的这批大工程全部完工了，我国的工业，就有了一个很大的基础。我们有的钢铁、煤油、电力、煤炭就要比现在多得多，我们就能自己造汽车、拖拉机和各种机器。
    要在这样短的时间建设这许多大矿山和大工厂，可不是一件简单的事。首先就得把矿找出来，现在就有几千人在全国许多地方找矿。开了矿，还得打地基买材料造工厂。有些大工程要好几年工夫，要十几亿、几十亿或者百多亿斤粮食的钱才能建设成功。有些地方还得预先修好铁路，才能把机器和各种建筑材料运进去，才能把生产的东西运出来。一个大工厂或者大矿山，现在要几千几万人去建设，将来要几千几万人去生产。仅仅在这五个年头里面，我们就需要几十万技术干部，还要更多的技术工人，普通的工人职员还不计算在内。这就是说，我们既然要建设矿山工厂，就得要招工人，招学生，设机关，造房子，修马路，修电灯、电话、自来水、下水道，扩大城市，增加城市……总之，为了工业化，就必须用很多人，用很多钱，来办这些事。现在中央人民政府和全国各大城市，就在整天忙着这些事。从前打日本打蒋介石的时候，整天是忙着打仗，现在也和打仗差不多，不过是打的建设仗，工业仗。
    我们的工业化，又叫做社会主义的工业化。为什么叫做社会主义的工业化呢？
    这就是说，我们所建设的这些矿山和工厂都是属于全国人民的，而不是属于少数资本家的。如果像美国英国那些资本主义国家那样，让工厂矿山由资本家开办，那么工业越发达，劳动人民越遭殃，因为资本家办工厂，只是为了剥削劳动人民，为他们自己赚钱。我们的国家是人民大众当家做主的国家，矿山工厂归国家所有，也就是归全体人民所有，国家办的矿山、工厂，是为全体人民谋福利的，所以叫做社会主义工业，不但新办的工业是社会主义工业，就是现在归私人所有的工业和手工业，也要一步一步变成社会主义的工业。这样地发展工业，就叫做社会主义的工业化。
  二、为什么要实行工业化
    我们一定要实行工业化，最要紧的原因有两个。
    第一，只有实行工业化，我们的国家才能富强起来，人民的生活才能越来越好。
    要国家富强，人民的生活好，最要紧的是生产的东西多。工业发达了，国家就能根据人民群众的需要，大量生产各种东西供给人民。工业发达了，人人都可以有职业，有固定的收入，可以不断改善生活。工业又能帮助农业发展，所以农业品也一定会越来越多，农民的收入也可以不断增加。我国自己能造火车、汽车、轮船，交通运输也就能更发展，工业和农业的生产品就可以运得又快又便宜。人民富了，国家就会富，国家就可以多办学校、医院、戏院、电影院，发展文化教育和卫生事业。这样，全国人民的生活就可以越来越好。
    过去我们的国家又穷又弱，老是受帝国主义欺侮，就是因为政治反动，工业不能发达。解放以后，帝国主义国家还是想欺侮我们，所以占了我们的台湾，并且侵略朝鲜。我们的国家工业化以后，不但人民生活可以改善，而且可以自己造飞机、坦克、大炮，我们就有更大的力量来保卫我们的和平生活。
  第二，只有实行工业化，我们才能同时实行国家对农业、手工业和私人工商业的社会主义改造。
    社会主义离不了工业。国家经营的工业不但是社会主义的榜样，而且是实行社会主义改造的主要力量。有了强大的社会主义的工业，就是说，国家自己生产的东西多了，才能有强大的社会主义的商业；有了强大的社会主义的工商业，就是说，不剥削人的工商业发达起来了，才有力量领导、限制和改造资本主义工商业；如果资本主义的工商业还要不受改造，还要唯利是图地剥削工人和农民，那就只有受到淘汰了。
    独立劳动的小农和小手工业者不是资本家，不是剥削者。但是单靠他们自己的力量，就走不到社会主义去，反而会走到资本主义去。只有国家的工业发达了，能够给农民各种新式农具和农业机器，帮助农民组织生产合作社，并且用其他各种工业品来换取农民的农产品，才能领导农民脱离小农经济和资本主义，走上社会主义的道路。对手工业的改造也是这样。将来一部分手工业者可以组织手工业生产合作社，按照国家加工订货的计划生产，一部分手工业者可以进国家的工厂。所以农业和手工业的社会主义改造，也要靠国家的社会主义工业领导，也要靠国家工业化。
  三、国家工业化对农民有什么好处
    国家的社会主义工业化能使国强民富，能使我国一步一步地过渡到社会主义，可见这件事对全国人民有极大的好处，当然也就是对全国农民有极大的好处。现在我们再专从农民这方面看看，工业化对农民的好处究竟是怎样的。
    首先，工业发达了，国家对于粮食、棉花和其他农产品的需要就会增加，同时国家也能用比过去更大的力量来帮助农业生产的发展。农业生产发展了，农产品的收购增加了，农民的收入就会增加，这是自然的道理。
    其次，工业发达了，国家就能用更多的、更好的、更便宜的步犁、马拉农具、水车、化学肥料，各种农药和喷雾器这些东西供给农民，将来还能用拖拉机和别的农业机器帮助农民。有了这些东西，农民不但可以大大增加和保证主业的生产，还能腾出手来，大大发展各种副业生产，而且吃力的重劳动也可以一步一步减轻。
    第三，工业发达了，就能多办水利建设，多筑水库，多修大堤水闸，不但免除水旱灾害，还能变旱地为水地，变沙地为良田。有的地方，将来还可以通轮船，发电，促进农村的繁荣。
    第四，工业发达了，国家能多修铁路、公路，多造火车、汽车、轮船和胶皮轮大车、自行车等等交通工具，城乡物资的交流就更顺畅，农民的收入和供给农村的工业品就都可以增加了。
    第五，工业发达了，国家一步一步富起来，就能一步一步降低工业品的价格（实际上也就是增加农民的收入），并且和农村的合作社共同用更多的力量来给农民办各种好事，比如增加农村的日用工业品供应，多吸收农民子女进中等以上的学校，多办农村文化教育卫生事业，多发农业贷款等等。
    还有，工业发达了，工厂、矿山、铁路，和城市里的各种机关，就都需要陆续增加工人和职员。农村里有一部分剩余劳动力就可以按国家的需要有计划有组织地调动到城市里，这对于农民家庭也可以减少开支而增加收入。
    总起来说，要改造农业生产，改善农民生活，都非工业化不可。我国的农民代表到苏联参观，曾经亲眼看到了社会主义工业化对农民的极大的好处。他们看见苏联的许多农村有铁路、公路和城市连着，许多农村已经和城市差不多，有马路、楼房、电灯、电话、中学校、医院、电影院、公园。集体农场里从犁地、播种、除草、施肥、除虫，直到收割、脱粒，甚至刨甜菜、摘棉花、挤牛奶、剪羊毛这些事都能用机器。苏联农民吃的、穿的、住的、用的，都比我们的好得多。我国要做到苏联这样子，当然不是一年两年的事，还得要十几年到二三十年。可是这几年来，由于我国的工业已经开始发展了一些，我国的农民就已经得到了像上面所说的几方面的好处，这些好处在各个地方虽然多少不等，但是都能一件一件数出来。社会主义的工业越发达，农民能得的好处就越多。将来实现了工业化，国家过渡到了社会主义，农民所得的好处就更大了。
    有的农民说：工业化好是好，就是怕要加重农民的负担。这种想法是弄错了。国家进行工业化建设，确实需要很多钱。为了国家的富强和农民本身的利益，农民负担一些是完全应该的。这就像秋天要收粮，春天就得下种施肥一样。但是农民的负担却不会加重，因为工业发展所需要的资金，主要的还是由工人阶级生产积蓄起来的。因此，一九五二年的农业税就比一九五一年减轻了一些。今年中央人民政府又决定在今后三年里面把农业税的总数稳定于一九五二年的水平，就是说，在这三年里面，不管生产怎样发展，农民仍旧按照他的地亩在平常年景应产的数量，根据税率交纳公粮，增产的部分完全归农民自己所有。另一方面，如果遇到了严重的灾害，农民却能根据国家的法令，得到减免公粮的照顾。
    不过，工业化既是这样一件伟大的事业，对国家和农民有这样大的好处，当然决不应当只由工人阶级负责。农民在全国有几万万，又有长久的革命历史，对于工业化这样的大事当然要积极努力参加，特别是要努力增加生产，发展互助合作，并且把国家需要的农产品卖给国家。关于这些方面的道理，我们以后还要详细讨论。
