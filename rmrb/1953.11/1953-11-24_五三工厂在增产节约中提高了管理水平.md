The "Five-Three" Factory has further improved its management level in the increased production and thrift campaign: labor productivity increased from 126 (based on the national plan as 100) in July to 136.04 in October; the production balance rate increased from 98.01% in July to 98.7% in the first half of October; and the production cycle was shortened from 42 days to 32 days.
    The factory mainly adopted the following measures to improve management work: First, promote advanced Soviet experience. After the "Eight Processes" work section of the Second Workshop promoted the advanced Soviet experience—labor division specialization, the production organization became more scientific and reasonable, and in less than a week, output increased by 14.8%, tools were saved by 21%, and rework products were reduced by 55.5%. On the second day of trying a Soviet advanced experience in one process, the output per machine increased from 643 kilograms to 747 kilograms, and the quality increased by 40%.
    Second, labor division specialization. After this method was gradually promoted, it became easier to learn technology. Coupled with other effective measures to actively help apprentices learn technology, the number of apprentices decreased rapidly, and the proportion of technicians increased relatively. In September, apprentices who were promoted to technicians through skill assessment accounted for 25.8% of the total number of apprentices, and in October, another 32.9% of the apprentices were promoted to technicians through skill assessment. The growth of this technical force is directly related to the acquisition of the aforementioned achievements.
    Third, after improving the method of compiling work plans, it played a significant role in promoting the work of the departments and the various business groups in the workshops. In the past, a part of the work plan was prepared by the workshop, submitted to the relevant departments of the factory for review and approval, and then returned to the workshop; when formulating the October work plan, it was changed to the relevant departments collecting data to formulate plans within their business scope, and submitting them to the production management department to compile into a work plan, and then submitting it to the workshop for discussion and determination, and finally approved by the factory. In this way, it not only centralized and unified, but also prompted personnel in various departments to strengthen contact with the workshop and master data, otherwise, they would not be able to formulate practical work plans. This gradually brought into play the role of various functional organizations.
    Other measures such as adjusting processes, improving equipment, improving operations, and improving various responsibility systems have also played a certain role in the acquisition of the aforementioned achievements.
    At present, the weak links of the "Five-Three" Factory are still the weakness of the departmental work, and the cooperation between departments and between departments and workshops cannot meet the needs of the work plan; the auxiliary workshops, especially the tool workshop, are still lagging behind the development of production; the technical security work is not enough.
    The leadership of the "Five-Three" Factory is mobilizing the masses to launch an in-depth competition to overcome these weak links.

### 五三工厂在增产节约中提高了管理水平

    五三工厂在增产节约中提高了管理水平
    “五三”工厂在增产节约竞赛中进一步提高了管理水平：劳动生产率由七月份的一百二十六（以国家计划为一百计算）提高到十月份的一百三十六点零四；生产均衡率七月份为百分之九十八点零一，十月上半月提高到百分之九十八点七；生产周期由四十二天缩短为三十二天。
    该厂在改进管理工作方面主要采取了以下几项措施：一、推广苏联先进经验。二车间“八道”工段推广苏联先进经验——劳动分工专业化后，使生产组织更加科学、合理，不到一个星期，产量提高百分之十四点八，节省工具百分之二十一，返修品减少百分之五十五点五。一工序试行一种苏联先进经验的第二天，每台机器的产量便由六百四十三公斤提高到七百四十七公斤，质量提高百分之四十。
    二、劳动分工专业化。这一办法逐步推广后便于学习技术，加上其他一些积极帮助徒工学习技术的有效措施，徒工数量迅速减少，技工比重相对增加了。九月份学徒经过考工升为技工者，占学徒总数的百分之二十五点八，十月份又有百分之三十二点九的学徒经过考工升为技工。这批技术力量的增长，对于前述成绩的获得有直接关系。
    三、改进作业计划的编制方法后，对科室工作和车间各业务组的工作，起了不小的推动作用。过去作业计划一部分是由车间编好，交厂部各有关科审定，厂部批准，再发还车间；制订十月份的作业计划时，便改由各有关科搜集资料制定本业务范围内的计划，交生产管理科汇总编制成作业计划，然后交车间讨论确定，最后由厂部批准。这样，既集中统一，又促使各科室人员必须加强与车间联系、掌握资料，否则就制订不出切合实际的作业计划。这就逐渐地发挥了各职能组织的作用。
    其他如调整工序、改进设备、改良操作、健全各项责任制度，对前述成绩的获得也起了一定的作用。
    目前，“五三”工厂的薄弱环节仍然是科室工作不强，各科室之间及科室与车间之间的配合还不能适应作业计划的需要；辅助车间、特别是工具车间还落在生产发展的后面；技术保安工作还不够。
  “五三”工厂领导上正在发动群众，为克服这些薄弱环节而深入展开竞赛。
