    (II) Learn from Experience and Vigorously Promote Winter Goods
    Shen Wenying
    "No goods at the beginning of the season, large influxes in the middle of the season, and stockpiles at the end of the season." This is one of the most erroneous practices in the operation of seasonal commodities by commercial departments. Because the result of this type of operation often leads to a large number of out-of-season commodities being stockpiled in warehouses, tying up a large amount of capital.
    However, our state-owned commercial departments have not been able to avoid this mistake today. The current large-scale stockpiling of undershirts and vests in various places is proof of this. At the end of September, the Shenyang area's department store wholesale station had an inventory of 120,035 dozens of undershirts and vests, but the station only sold 27,281 dozens from January to September this year. This means that, based on this year's sales, it would take more than three years to sell them all. The China Department Store Company's Fujian Provincial Company also has a large inventory of undershirts and vests, enough to sell for more than two years. The amount stockpiled in twelve provinces and cities, including Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, and Fushun, also exceeds this year's sales volume.
    These undershirts and vests were processed, ordered, purchased, and transferred in April, May, June, and July of this year, so of course, the time of purchase was too late. Currently, except for a small portion that can still be promoted in provinces such as Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, these commodities will not be marketable until March or April of next year, with an average stockpiling period of ten months. The expenses for interest, warehouse rent, insurance, and management will exceed 10% of the capital. What is more serious is the shortage of goods during the peak season and the stockpiling during the off-season, which wastes state funds and fails to meet consumer needs.
    There are many reasons for the stockpiling of seasonal commodities, but the main reason is the failure to seriously summarize the experience of operating seasonal commodities and thus learn from the lessons, so the time for processing orders and purchasing is always too late every year, and there is not enough vigorous promotion during the peak season. In terms of climate, in the south, wholesale departments should start selling summer goods in March, and in the north, they should start selling them in April. All localities must propose processing, ordering, and transportation plans based on the distance from the production area and the quality of transportation conditions. For example, if the Southwest region needs summer goods produced in Shanghai, it must propose a plan in December of the previous year, process, order, and purchase goods in Shanghai in January, transport most of the goods to the sales area starting in March, and transport all of them by April. Wholesale departments should sell most of the summer goods by July, and retail departments must sell most of them by August. In areas with even shorter summers, goods should be purchased and sold out even earlier.
    Judging from the current operation of winter goods in the state-owned department store system, the arrival time of flannelette underwear and wool yarn is relatively timely in various places, but the idea of seizing the peak season to vigorously promote winter goods is not clear. Some units still have the phenomenon of blindly purchasing goods. Looking at the purchase and sale of sanitary shirts and pants, the inventory at the end of 1952 plus all the purchases in 1953 is equal to 185% of the actual sales volume in 1952, and some areas are still blindly believing that the supply of goods is insufficient, resulting in the idea of ​​being reluctant to sell. This phenomenon should arouse the attention of department stores at all levels, and they must learn from the lessons of the stockpiling of undershirts and vests, immediately check the purchase, sale, and inventory of winter goods, mobilize employees, and come up with various effective methods to actively promote sales in conjunction with grain purchases, and strive to sell all winter goods during the peak commercial season.

### （二）接受经验教训，大力推销冬货

    （二）接受经验教训，大力推销冬货
    沈文英
    “季初无货、季中大进、季末积压。”这是商业部门经营季节性商品的一种最错误的作法。因为这种经营的结果，常常会使大量背节的商品积压在仓库内，使大量的资金被积压。
    可是，我们的国营商业部门，今天并没有能避免这种错误。各地目前大量积压汗衫和背心的情况，就是一个证明。沈阳地区百货批发站九月底库存汗衫、背心一十二万零三十五打，但该站今年一至九月份仅销出二万七千二百八十一打。这就是说，按照今年的销量，要三年多才能销售完。中国百货公司福建省公司库存的汗衫、背心也很多，足够销售两年多。辽西、黑龙江、四川、抚顺等十二个省市积压的数量，也都超过今年的销售量。
    这些汗衫、背心是在今年四、五、六、七月份加工订货收购调拨进来的，当然进货的时间是过迟了。这些商品，目前除云南、广东、广西等省还能推销一小部分外，要到明年三、四月里才能应销，平均要积压十个月，其利息、仓租、保险、保管等费用，就超过资金百分之十。更严重的是旺季缺货，背季积压，既浪费国家资金，又不能满足消费者的需要。
    造成季节性商品积压的原因是很多的，但主要是由于不认真总结季节性商品经营的经验，从而接受教训，因而在加工定货采购的时间历年总是太晚，到了旺季又不大力推销。按气候来说，在南方，批发部门应在三月份开始销售夏令货，北方应在四月份开始销售，各地必须根据离产地的远近和交通运输条件的好坏提出加工、定货、运输计划。如西南区需要上海产的夏令货，必须在上年十二月份提出计划，一月份即在上海加工、订货、进货，三月份开始把商品大部分运到销售地区，四月份要全部运到。批发部门要在七月份把夏令货大部卖完，零售部门必须在八月份大部卖完。部分地区夏季更短的，就更应早进货早销完。
    按照目前国营百货系统对冬令货经营情况来看，各地绒衣、毛线的到货时间尚较及时，但对抓住旺季大力推销冬令货的思想是不明确的。有些单位，仍有盲目进货的现象。以卫生衫裤的进销情况来看，一九五二年末库存加一九五三年全部进货等于一九五二年实销量的百分之一百八十五，而且有些地区还在盲目地认为货源不足而产生惜售思想。这一现象，应该引起各级百货公司的重视，必须接受汗衫、背心积压事件的教训，立即检查冬令货的进销存情况，发动职工，想出各种有效的办法来，配合购粮，积极推销，力求在商业旺季中把冬令货全部推销出去。
