    Improvements Needed in the Sales Procedures for Small Hardware Items at the Beijing Hardware and Machinery Company

    Reader Wang Kui wrote: After reading reader Wang Ruozheng's letter criticizing the overly complex sales procedures of the Beijing Hardware and Machinery Company, published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on August 26th, I strongly agree. Comrade Wang Ruozheng only mentioned the situation with large hardware. I work in the company's Mechanical Tool Wholesale Department, and I deeply feel that the sales procedures for small hardware are even more complicated and similarly need improvement.

    Here, opening a single form involves seven copies, and requires stamping over thirty seals. The forms only have three blank spaces; therefore, if a customer wants to buy four items, we have to open two sets, which is fourteen copies. Moreover, goods produced by different countries cannot be written on the same set of forms; if the four items a customer buys are from four countries, we have to open four sets, which is twenty-eight copies. Thus, for one transaction, just opening the forms and stamping them takes a lot of time, often making customers impatient. This undoubtedly affects our work efficiency and wastes the customer's time.

    Customers have a lot of complaints about the above situation, and we also have complaints. We have studied improvement methods and have raised them with the leadership several times. We have designed a new form style that can record six items from different countries on one set of forms, which not only will not affect the role of the forms, but also can save a lot of time, money, and labor. However, the leadership has consistently not paid attention to these opinions. The most recent reply we received was: "Study it further, and we'll talk about it after the old forms are used up." But there are still many old forms left; when will they be used up? Would they rather cherish these pieces of paper than risk causing greater losses in work?

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published Comrade Wang Ruozheng's letter, the Beijing Hardware and Machinery Company wrote to indicate that they had begun to pilot methods to improve sales procedures for large hardware items on September 1st. It is hoped that the company will also quickly study and improve the sales procedures for small hardware items.

### 北京市五金机械公司小五金商品售货手续要改进

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市五金机械公司小五金商品售货手续要改进
    读者王魁经来信：八月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了读者王若征批评北京市五金机械公司售货手续过于繁复的来信，我读后很有同感。王若征同志提的还只是大五金方面的情况。我在公司的机械工具批发部工作，深深觉得小五金方面的售货手续更其繁复，同样有改进的必要。
    我们这里开一联票据就有七张，而且还要盖上三十多个图章。票据只有三个空格；因此，如果一个顾客要买四件货，我们就要开两联即十四张票据。而且，由不同国家生产的商品不能写在一联票据上；如果顾客买的四件商品是来自四个国家的，我们就要开四联即二十八张票据。这样，一笔交易，光开票据和盖图章就要花许多时间，往往使顾客感到不耐烦。这无疑影响了我们的工作效率，同时也浪费了顾客的时间。
    对于以上情况，顾客们很有意见，我们也有意见。我们研究了改进办法，曾向领导方面提过几次。我们曾设计出一种新的票据式样，一次可以把不同国家的商品六件开在一联票据上，这不仅不会影响票据所起的作用，而且可以节省不少时间、金钱和劳动力。但是领导方面对这些意见始终没有重视。最近我们得到的答复是：“再研究研究，等旧票据用完后再说”。可是旧票据还有不少，何时用完呢？难道宁愿珍惜这些纸张而不惜造成工作上的更大损失吗？
    编者按：本报发表王若征同志的来信后，北京市五金机械公司曾来信表示，他们已于九月一日开始试行在大五金商品方面改进售货手续的办法。希望该公司对小五金商品的售货手续也能很快加以研究改进。
