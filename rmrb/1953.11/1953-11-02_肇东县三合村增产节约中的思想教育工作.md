The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) branch in Sanhe Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, following the County Committee's directives before the Mid-Autumn Festival, convened an expanded branch committee meeting, a village people's representative meeting, a propaganda worker meeting, and village gatherings to call for increased production and practicing economy. After these meetings, the masses took some action: some enclosed scattered pigpens, four households stopped using grain to feed horses, and several households harvested grain more carefully. Superficially, the movement seemed to be underway. The branch also reported to higher authorities: "Increased production and practicing economy has been implemented."

However, after several days of in-depth investigation, the farmers revealed their true feelings. They had different views on the current call for increased grain production and practicing economy during the autumn harvest. Some people had a certain understanding of increased production and practicing economy and had a desire to do a good job in the autumn harvest. They said: The Party and the government's call for increased production and practicing economy is correct. The amount of grain harvested determines the future of production and life. As long as we are careful, we can increase production and practice economy, "tightening our belts will save two dou." They expressed dissatisfaction with the waste of grain caused by free-range livestock trampling crops. This type of person only accounted for a small minority in the village. A considerable number of people adopted an "it doesn't matter" attitude toward increased production and practicing economy, thinking "practicing economy is mentioned every year, but we practice economy even if it is not mentioned," "who doesn't know how to practice economy, would we throw away our own crops for nothing?" During the autumn harvest, they acted as they had in previous years, without any positive actions to increase production and practice economy. Most of the masses had concerns about increased production and practicing economy. Some feared that increased production and practicing economy would lead to a heavier public grain burden; some feared that if they saved grain, others would borrow it and not return it. Farmers who had not suffered from disasters thought that if grain was increased and economized, the public grain reduced or exempted for disaster-stricken households would be added to their burden; disaster-stricken farmers were afraid that if they increased production and practiced economy, their public grain would not be reduced or exempted. A few farmers even resisted increased production and practicing economy, saying: "How can we avoid wasting a little grain when harvesting land, people even drop grains of rice when eating!" "The Great Northern Wilderness is a land of plenty." Some farmers who were not content with agricultural production were also unwilling to listen to the call for increased production and practicing economy. This year, eleven households in the village have already sold horses and land and gone to cities, and ten more households are preparing to leave.

These situations showed that it was not enough to make general calls for increased production and practicing economy at meetings. To transform the call for increased grain production and practicing economy into the conscious action of the majority of farmers, the key link at present is to conduct thorough ideological mobilization work among the masses, so that political work can adapt to the current economic tasks. We firmly grasped this link and carried out different forms of propaganda and education according to different thoughts, so that the Party's policies penetrated the masses and achieved relatively significant results.

The ideological mobilization work we carried out in Sanhe Village started from the following aspects: First, starting from the farmers' vital interests, we explained that doing a good job in the autumn harvest and increasing the grain harvest directly increased the farmers' income. The more grain farmers harvested, the more grain they could sell, and the more means of production they could exchange. This would allow them to expand production, continuously improve their lives, and support national industrial construction. As the country developed industry, farmers could obtain better and cheaper means of production and means of subsistence. We used this year's wheat prices as a practical example to illustrate the country's measures to continuously narrow the price gap between industrial and agricultural products. This made the farmers realize that increasing production and practicing economy and doing a good job in the autumn harvest would benefit them both in the present and in the future. Second, we comprehensively explained the Party's policies, stating that agricultural taxes would not be increased for those who produced more than last year, and reductions or exemptions would be implemented according to the severity of the disaster for those who suffered disasters. If the degree of disaster was originally the same, but one suffered less disaster because of their efforts to salvage, they would not pay more public grain than other disaster-stricken households. In addition, we also publicized mutual aid and cooperation policies, loan policies, etc. Third, we promoted the worker-peasant alliance, explained the importance of agricultural production, and clarified the interrelationship between agricultural production and industrial production, clarifying the future prospects of rural development. Fourth, we called on farmers to carry forward their inherent qualities of diligence and frugality, pointing out that the fruits of a year of hard labor should not be wasted during the autumn harvest. At the same time, we inspired the masses to recall and expose past examples of sloppy fieldwork that wasted grain, and introduced the village's existing good experiences in pulling, harvesting, and threshing quickly and carefully.

In the process of carrying out propaganda work, we went deep into the fields to understand the production situation of the masses, understand their thoughts, and seized examples to clarify the truth at any time and place, and solved the ideological problems of the masses. We also conducted ideological education among group members and cooperative members through small meetings within mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. After repeated propaganda and education in the fields and threshing grounds, and within groups and cooperatives, increased production and practicing economy became the conscious action of the majority of the masses in Sanhe Village. They said: This really touched our hearts. After listening to the reasoning, our hearts are bright, and we must do a good job. Mutual aid groups and cooperatives have launched patriotic production increase and economy practice red flag competitions. In the past, women did not have the habit of harvesting land, but this time more than fifty women in the village participated in the harvest, making the harvesting progress faster than in previous years, and the quality of fieldwork was also more meticulous than in previous years. The Chen Yuzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative initially only focused on speed, and one piece of land was harvested very roughly. After receiving education on increased production and practicing economy, the cooperative members felt that this was not right. When they went home for dinner, they picked through the ditch along the field ridges and gathered more than one dou of grain. The next day, they paid more attention to careful harvesting. Farmers throughout the village also paid attention to the feeding and management of livestock, looking for substitutes for feeding pigs to save grain. Many mutual aid groups have changed the past habit of free-range livestock, digging trenches around the farmyard to prevent livestock from trampling on grain.

After the masses dispelled their ideological concerns and understood the principles of increased production and practicing economy, the movement for increased production and practicing economy in the whole village quickly unfolded, and a new atmosphere of diligence and thrift was established. The act of wasting grain has been subject to the sanctions of public opinion. For example, a piece of land in the Chen Yuzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative was not harvested cleanly, and it was criticized by many farmers.

    肇东县三合村增产节约中的思想教育工作
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部副部长  骆子程
    中共黑龙江省肇东县三合村支部，在中秋节前，根据县委的布置，通过支委扩大会议、村人民代表会议、宣传员会议、村屯群众大会，号召增产节约。这样做了以后，群众也有了一些行动：有的把散猪圈起来了，有四户不用谷子喂马了，有几户收割谷子也细致些了。从表面看上去，运动是展开了。支部也向上级汇报：“增产节约贯彻了。”
    但是，经过几天深入的了解，农民说出了真心话。他们对当前秋收中增产节约粮食的号召各有各的看法：有一些人对于增产节约有了一定的认识，也有积极搞好秋收的要求。他们说：党和政府号召增产节约很对，粮食收多收少，决定以后生产和生活的好坏。只要留心，就能增产节约，“紧紧手，省二斗”。他们对于散放牲畜糟踏庄稼等浪费粮食的事情表示不满。这种人在村中只占少数。有相当一部分人对增产节约抱着“无所谓”的态度，认为“节约年年提，不提也节约”，“谁还不知道节约，自己的庄稼能白扔吗”？在秋收时他们还和往年一样，没有什样积极增产节约的行动。多数群众对增产节约有顾虑。有的怕增产节约多收了粮食公粮要加重；有的怕省下粮食别人借去不还。没有受灾的农户以为增产节约了粮食，就要把受灾户减免的公粮加在自己身上；受了灾的农户又怕增产节约了以后，公粮就不得减免了。有少数农民对增产节约还有抵触情绪，说：“割地那能不糟损点粮食，吃饭还掉饭粒呢！”“北大荒就是粮铺地。”还有一些不安心农业生产的农民，也不愿听增产节约的号召。全村今年卖马卖地外出到城市去的已有十一户，正张罗着外出的还有十户。
    这些情况，说明了只在会上进行增产节约的一般号召是不够的。要把增产节约粮食的号召变成多数农民自觉的行动，当前的主要环节是深入地对群众进行思想发动工作，使政治工作能够适应当前的经济工作任务。我们紧紧抓住了这个环节，针对不同思想进行了不同方式的宣传教育，使党的政策深入群众，收到了比较显著的效果。
    我们在三合村进行的思想动员工作，是从这几方面着手的：一、从农民的切身利益讲起，说明做好秋收工作、增加粮食收获量，就是直接增加了农民的收入。农民多收了粮食就能多卖粮食，多换生产资料。这样就一方面可以扩大生产，不断改善生活，一方面可以支援国家工业建设。国家发展了工业，农民就可以得到更好、更便宜的生产资料和生活资料。我们用今年的小麦价格作实际例子，说明了国家不断缩小工业品和农产品差价的措施。这就使农民认识到增产节约搞好秋收，对自己眼前和将来都有好处。二、全面地讲解了党的政策，说明了比去年增产的也不增加农业税，受了灾按灾情轻重实行减免。如果受灾程度本来相同，因为自己努力抢救而受灾较轻，也不比别的受灾户多出公粮。此外对互助合作政策、借贷政策等也进行了宣传。三、宣传工农联盟，说明农业生产的重要性，说明农业生产和工业生产的相互关系，讲清楚农村的发展前途。四、号召农民发扬勤劳俭朴的本色，指出一年辛苦劳动的成果，不能在秋收中糟踏掉。同时启发群众回忆揭露过去田间作业粗糙浪费粮食的事例，介绍本村已有的拉、割、打又快又细致的好经验。
    在进行宣传工作的过程中，我们深入田间，了解了群众的生产情况，摸清了群众的思想，并且随时随地抓住实例，讲清道理，解决了群众的思想问题。我们还通过互助组和农业生产合作社内的小型会议，向组员和社员进行了思想教育。经过了田间场头、组里社里反复宣传教育以后，增产节约已成了三合村大多数群众自觉的行动。他们说：这算讲到心里去了。听完道理心里亮堂，真要好好干。互助组、合作社都展开了秋收爱国增产节约红旗竞赛。过去妇女没有割地的习惯，这次全村有五十多个妇女参加了收割，使收割进度比往年快，田间工作质量也比往年细致。陈玉璋农业生产合作社起初只抢快，有一块地割得很毛糙。受到增产节约教育后的社员们，感到这样做不对，在回家吃饭时，就顺着地垅沟拣了一遍，共拣了一斗多粮食。第二天他们就更注意仔细收割了。全村农民也注意了牲畜的饲养和管理，找代食品喂猪，节省粮食。很多互助组都改变了过去散放牲畜的习惯，挖了场园壕，阻拦牲畜糟踏粮食。
    群众解除了思想顾虑，明白了增产节约的道理以后，全村的增产节约运动很快就展开起来了，而且树立了勤俭节约的新风气，浪费粮食的行为已受到群众舆论的制裁。如陈玉璋农业生产合作社有一块地收获得不干净，就受到许多农民的批评。
