Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. The Syngman Rhee clique, in order to suppress the increasingly fierce resistance of the South Korean people, is making every effort to strengthen its fascist police rule in South Korea.

    According to the "Democratic Korea" newspaper in Pyongyang: The Syngman Rhee puppet government recently formulated the so-called "Police Independence Act" and established a "Police Committee" to directly control the power to manage the police. At the same time, the puppet National Assembly passed a "directive" from the puppet President Syngman Rhee on September 29, deciding to "recruit" 14,000 so-called "volunteer police officers" by the end of this year, with a budget of 370 million won in puppet currency. South Korean newspapers revealed that since the announcement of this decision, "recruitment" work has been carried out with various violent means in various parts of South Korea. In the Haman area, puppet police detachments are using methods of capturing young men to "recruit" so-called "volunteer police officers."

    李承晚匪帮加强警察统治
   【新华社平壤九日电】李承晚匪帮为了镇压南朝鲜人民越来越激烈的反抗情绪，正在南朝鲜竭力加强它的法西斯的警察统治。
    据平壤“民主朝鲜报”报道：李承晚伪政府最近制订了所谓“警察独立法案”，设立了“警察委员会”，由李承晚直接掌握管理警察的权力。同时，伪国会在九月二十九日通过了伪总统李承晚的一项“指令”，决定在今年年底以前“征募”所谓“义勇警官”一万四千名，其经费预算额是伪币三亿七千万圆。南朝鲜报纸透露：自这一决定公布以后，南朝鲜各地已用各种暴力手段进行“征募”工作。在咸安地区，各伪警察支署都用抓捕壮丁的办法来“征募”所谓“义勇警官”。
