In Shenyang, almost every factory, enterprise employee, and government cadre watched the films shown during the Film Week. In the East China region, audience pre-orders for tickets in the four cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Jinan reached over 892,500 before the Film Week even opened. In Hangzhou, on the first Sunday (the 8th) after the start of the Film Week, the Xinhua Cinema screened ten shows from morning till night to meet audience demand, with over 11,000 viewers, an unprecedented scene for the cinema. In the Central South region, in addition to the designated cities of Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Changsha, the Soviet Film Week was also held in Nanchang, Guilin, Liuzhou, Hengyang, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Nanning, and other places. In the Southwest region, the three cities of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming saw a total audience of over 1,413,000 in the six days from the 7th to the 12th, exceeding the projected figure by 50 percent. In Xi'an, each cinema increased the number of screenings from four to seven per day, and farmers from nearby counties such as Sanyuan and Lintong also came to watch. During the Film Week, cinemas also added special children's screenings.

    Audiences in various locations held discussion meetings after watching the films screened during the Film Week. Workers and cadres from the Beijing Automobile Parts Factory and various government agencies in Beijing, after watching the film "Happiness," which depicts the victorious struggle of socialist transformation in Soviet agriculture, connected it with their current study of the general line for the transition period of the state, further strengthening their confidence and determination to realize the general line for the transition period. Over 500 students from the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University held a discussion after watching "Far From Moscow," resolving to learn from the film's advanced characters' spirit of hard work and heroic qualities. The broad masses of workers, staff, youth, and students in Harbin unanimously believed that the noble qualities of the Soviet people displayed in the film "Far From Moscow" gave them great encouragement and education.

    In cities that did not hold the Soviet Film Week, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Hefei, and Qingdao, the East China Branch of the China Film Distribution Company also allocated some films from the Soviet Film Week for screening locally. Cinemas in Yiliang, Mengzi, and Yuxi cities in Yunnan Province also screened Soviet films. During the Film Week, film projection teams were organized in Chongqing, Chengdu, Wuhan, and other places to screen Soviet films in other towns and villages with inconvenient transportation.

    我国人民热烈欢迎苏联电影周中放映的影片
    据新华社讯：为庆祝十月社会主义革命节三十六周年在各城市举办的“苏联电影周”，受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    北京首都、大华等七家电影院举行的苏联电影周在十六日结束，观众达三十一万多人次。天津到十三日止观众达十八万四千多人次。东北区沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、鞍山、旅大五个城市三十一家电影院，从七日到十三日共放映了八百七十三场，观众达七十九万多人次。沈阳市几乎每个工厂、企业职工和机关干部都看了电影周中所映出的影片。华东区上海、南京、杭州、济南四个城市在电影周开幕前夕，观众预订电影票的就达八十九万二千五百多人次。杭州市在电影周开始后的第一个星期日（八日），新华电影院为了满足观众的要求，从早到晚一连放映了十场，观众达一万一千多人次，为该院空前未有的盛况。中南区举行苏联电影周的城市，除规定的武汉、广州、长沙外，又增加了南昌、桂林、柳州、衡阳、开封、郑州、南宁等地。西南区重庆、成都、昆明三个城市在七日到十二日六天中观众共达一百四十一万三千多人次，超过了预计数字的百分之五十。西安市各影院由过去每天放映四场增加到七场，西安市附近的三原、临潼等县的农民也都赶来观看。各影院在电影周中还特别为儿童们增加了儿童场。
    各地观众看了电影周中放映的影片后，都纷纷举行了座谈会。北京汽车配件厂和北京市各机关的工人、干部看到“光明照耀到克奥尔地村”影片中描写苏联农业社会主义改造胜利的斗争，都联系到目前学习国家过渡时期的总路线，更加强了实现国家过渡时期总路线的信心和决心。北京师范大学附属中学五百多学生看了“远离莫斯科的地方”后，展开了讨论，决心学习影片中先进人物的艰苦作风和英雄品质。哈尔滨市广大工人、职员、青年、学生一致认为“远离莫斯科的地方”影片中所表现的苏维埃人的高贵品质，给了他们很大的鼓舞和教育。
    在未举行苏联电影周的城市如福州、厦门、合肥、青岛等地，也都由中国电影发行公司华东区公司调拨部分苏联电影周的影片在当地放映。云南省宜良、蒙自、玉溪等城市的电影院，也都放映了苏联电影。在电影周期间，重庆、成都、武汉等地并组织了电影放映队到其他交通不便的城、镇或农村放映苏联电影。
