The Wuxi Food Industry Union recently held symposiums for worker representatives from the flour and rice milling industries to specifically study methods for saving grain.

Attending the meeting were labor models, workshop directors, technicians, veteran skilled workers, machinists, and staff. At the meeting, everyone engaged in full discussion and research. All agreed that there was still much potential to be tapped in various factories to improve grain quality, reduce losses, and increase product yields. As long as everyone paid attention to mastering the machines and utilizing technical skills, they could save a large amount of grain for the country. For example, in rice mills, the percentage of broken rice can still be reduced. The rice yield rate of milling the same type of rice to the same degree of fineness can also be increased, producing an extra half-catty to twelve taels of rice per hundred catties of paddy. If the inspection in the hulling room, which is currently done after the hulling machine stops, is changed to being done when the machine starts, small rice grains and chaff that fly into the hulling waste can be reduced. In the granary yard, during unloading rice from boats and when entering the factory, losses of paddy can also be avoided. If the rice grains in the cracks in the floor are swept up, considerable waste can be reduced.

There are also many areas for savings in flour mills. Currently, the bran's flour content is still relatively high. Generally, low is half a catty to one catty of flour per hundred catties of bran, while high reaches three catties. The acceptable moisture range of wheat (from 13.5% to 14%) should also be correctly controlled. If the wheat is too dry, the flour color will not improve, and the flour yield rate will decrease. If it is too wet, it will affect both the yield and the quality. In addition, to increase the product yield, the wheat blending must be correctly controlled. After the wheat enters the machine, the patrol operation system must be well mastered, with frequent inspections of flour color, frequent checks of the flour and bran yield rate, and frequent checks of the bran's flour content, to reduce by-products and increase flour production. The China Grain Company originally stipulated a by-product rate standard of 18.5 catties, and everyone believes they can confidently reduce it by another catty and are striving for the target of 17 catties. If by-products can be reduced by one catty, this will increase flour by one catty, and when calculating the processing of wheat in total, this is a significant amount of savings.

The employees attending the meeting not only identified ways to save from their own efforts but also made many suggestions to relevant departments. For example, if the variety, moisture content, color (i.e., early, mid, and late-season rice), region, and operation in purchasing, collecting, storing, transporting, loading, unloading, and sun-drying can be strictly implemented according to standards and clearly distinguished, it is generally estimated that the rice yield can be increased by one catty to one and a half catties per hundred catties of paddy.

Before this meeting, some employees believed that the food industry only completed processing tasks and that there was insufficient work, so no production could be increased. This erroneous understanding was corrected at this meeting. The meeting made everyone clear on how to immediately and specifically achieve increased production and savings, thus boosting confidence. Now, the union leadership has studied specific implementation measures and is launching a comprehensive campaign for increased production and savings in the city's food industry.

    无锡食品工业工会研究节约粮食办法
    无锡市食品工业工会，最近先后召开了面粉、碾米两业职工代表座谈会，具体研究节约粮食的办法。
    出席会议的有劳动模范、工务主任、技师、老年技工、机匠、职员等。在会上大家进行了充分的讨论和研究，一致认为各厂在提高粮食的质量及减少损耗和提高产品折率上，还有很多潜在力量没有发挥，只要大家注意掌握机器，发挥技术能力，就可以为国家节约大量粮食。譬如，在碾米厂中还可以把碎米率减少；同一品种的稻碾同一精度的米的产米折率也可以提高，每百斤稻可多产米半斤到十二两。砻糠间原为停砻后检查，如改为开砻时检查，可减少米粒白片小稻飞到砻糠里去。在盘廒、运稻下船和进厂时，也可做到不损失稻谷；地缝里的米粒如扫出来也可减少不少损耗。
    在面粉厂中可节约的方面也很多。目前，麸皮含粉率还比较大，一般低的是每百斤麸皮含半斤到一斤粉，高的达到了三斤。小麦水分的幅度（自百分之十三点五到百分之十四）也应正确掌握，如小麦过分干了，粉色提不高，出粉折率也就降低；过分潮了，又要影响产量与质量。此外，要提高产品率，必须正确掌握配麦。在小麦进机后，要很好掌握巡回操作制度，勤检验粉色，勤检查粉麸折率，勤检查麸皮含粉率，以减少副产品，增加面粉产量。中国粮食公司原规定副产品率标准为十八斤半，大家认为有把握再减低一斤，并有信心向十七斤目标努力；如能减少一斤副产品，即增加了一斤面粉，把加工小麦统计起来算，这笔节约数字是不少的。
    到会职工不但从本身所能努力的方面找出节约的办法来，同时又向有关方面提出很多建议。如在收购、征集、储藏、运输、装卸、翻晒等方面，能将品种、水分、色泽（即早色、中色、晚色稻）、地区、操作业务等严格按标准执行，并分别清楚，据一般估计，每百斤稻可增产米一斤到一斤半。
    这次会议以前，有些职工认为食品工业所完成的全是加工任务，开工不足，无产可增，这种错误认识在这次会上得到了纠正。会议使大家对如何来立即具体实现增产节约心中有了数，因而信心提高。现在工会领导上已研究具体贯彻办法，正在全市食品工业中全面开展增产节约运动。
