Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 17th. The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the 17th:

    The explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side, after being forced into a lengthy interruption, had just resumed on November 16th due to repeated efforts by the Korean-Chinese side, but was again forced to be interrupted by November 17th.

    To ensure that the explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side, after resuming on November 16th, could proceed normally in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," the Korean-Chinese side pointed out to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on November 14th: the Commission and the Indian custodial troops must thoroughly eliminate the control of Chiang and Li secret agents over the prisoners of war under the instigation of the US side, strictly prohibit secret agents and prisoners of war held hostage by secret agents from making noise and disturbances in the explanation tents, and prohibit US personnel from influencing prisoners of war and interfering with explanations in the explanation tents, and ensure that certain representatives of the affiliated institutions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission abide by the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules of Work." Only in this way can the plan proposed by the Korean-Chinese side be realized. However, in the explanation work on November 16th, because the control of the Chiang and Li secret agents over the prisoners of war was not lifted, the secret agents and the prisoners of war they held hostage made noise and acted violently in the explanation tents, US personnel still used various methods to influence the prisoners of war, and the affiliated institutions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to fulfill their duties, so that the explanation representatives of the Korean-Chinese side could only give explanations to a small portion of the prisoners of war planned for that day.

    When the explanation representatives of the Korean-Chinese side discovered on November 16th that the original explanation plan proposed by the Korean-Chinese side would be difficult to complete, they pointed out to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that prisoners of war who had not been explained should be separated from prisoners of war who had been explained but had not applied for repatriation, in accordance with the express provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules of Work." At the end of the explanation work that day, the Korean-Chinese side once again proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to isolate the majority of the prisoners of war in the original plan who had not been explained, so that the Korean-Chinese side could continue to explain to them.

    The Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission clearly stated to the Korean-Chinese side as early as November 6th: "Although there are manpower difficulties, I am still prepared to build another camp to cope with this possible situation... This other camp will enable the Indian custodial troops to isolate the explained prisoners of war from the unexplained prisoners of war, as long as you agree not to request explanations to a new camp before completing the explanations of all the prisoners of war in one camp." The Korean-Chinese side immediately agreed to this request from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on that day.

    However, on November 16th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops did not, in accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules of Work" and the promise of the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, separate the unexplained prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 from the prisoners of war who had heard the explanation but had not applied for repatriation. When the Korean-Chinese side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it was scheduled to continue explaining to the unexplained prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 on November 17th in order to complete the explanation to all the prisoners of war in that camp, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops, under the obstruction of US secret agents, stated that they could not make arrangements in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules of Work."

    Due to the various sabotage activities of the US side and the Chiang and Li secret agents it has deployed, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has been repeatedly interrupted. The Korean-Chinese side firmly believes that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops should immediately take measures to correct the above-mentioned situation to ensure the progress of the explanation work and the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules of Work."

    我方就解释工作再度被迫中断发表公报
    要求中立国遣返委员会分别看管已听解释和未听解释的战俘
    【新华社开城十七日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团十七日发表公报如下：
    朝中方面的解释工作在被迫长期中断后刚于十一月十六日由于朝中方面的一再努力而宣告恢复，但至十一月十七日却又被迫中断。
    为使朝中方面的解释工作在十一月十六日恢复后得以按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”的规定正常进行，朝中方面曾在十一月十四日向中立国遣返委员会指出：该委员会及印度看管部队必须彻底清除蒋、李特务在美方指使下对战俘的控制，严禁特务及在特务挟持下的战俘在解释帐篷大吵大闹，以及美方人员在解释帐篷内影响战俘、干扰解释，并保证中立国遣返委员会附属机构的某些代表信守“职权范围”与“工作细则”的规定。只有如此，朝中方面所提出的计划才能实现。但在十一月十六日的解释工作中，由于蒋、李特务对战俘的控制未被解除，特务及其挟持下的战俘在解释帐篷内吵闹行凶，美方人员依然使用各种方法影响战俘，而中立国遣返委员会附属机构又未能尽职，乃使朝中方面解释代表在当天只能向原计划中的少数一部分战俘进行解释。
    当十一月十六日朝中方面解释代表发现朝中方面原提的解释计划势将难于完成时，即已向中立国遣返委员会指出，未经解释的战俘应按照“工作细则”第二十款的明文规定，与经过解释尚未申请遣返的战俘隔离。当天解释工作结束时，朝中方面再一次向中立国遣返委员会提出，将未经解释的原定计划中的大部分战俘予以隔离，以便朝中方面继续向他们进行解释。
    中立国遣返委员会主席早已在十一月六日向朝中方面明确表示：“虽有人力的困难，我仍准备修建另一营场以应付此种可能产生的情况……这另一营场将使印度看管部队能够隔离已经解释的战俘与未经解释的战俘，只要你同意在完成一个营场的全部战俘的解释前，不要求向新的营场进行解释。”朝中方面当日即同意了中立国遣返委员会的这一要求。
    但十一月十六日中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队竟又没有按照“工作细则”的规定和中立国遣返委员会主席的诺言，隔离第五十三号营场未经解释的战俘与听过解释尚未申请遣返的战俘。而当朝中方面通知中立国遣返委员会定于十一月十七日继续向第五十三号营场未听解释的战俘进行解释以便完成对该营场的全部战俘的解释时，中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队在美方特务的阻挠下，表示无法根据“职权范围”与“工作细则”的规定进行安排。
    由于美方及其布置的蒋、李特务的种种破坏活动，朝中方面的解释工作已一再陷于中断。朝中方面坚决认为中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队应立即采取措施，纠正上述情况，以保证解释工作的进行以及“职权范围”与“工作细则”的实施。
