The Liuzhou Railway Bureau frequently experiences business accidents. According to statistics, 455 business accidents occurred in the second quarter alone, including 302 cases of quantity discrepancies and 109 cases of moisture damage. For grain alone, 13,541 bags were damaged by moisture, totaling over 1,175,000 kilograms, resulting in losses of approximately 1.77 billion yuan.

Some leading cadres of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau have consistently not paid enough attention to business work, rarely inquiring about or inspecting it. Some stationmasters believe: "If a traffic accident occurs, serious cases are recorded as demerits, and minor cases require self-criticism; for business accidents, the most that happens is compensation." They allow business work to drift. For example, once at Zixi Station, when loading grain, the weigher discovered over 30 small holes in the tarpaulin and told the stationmaster that it should not be used. The stationmaster said: "It doesn't matter, it's only a few kilometers, it'll be there after the turn." Once, Quanxian Station loaded eight cars of grain, three of which were leaking rain. The loading and unloading workers told the weigher, but the weigher said: "A little rain doesn't matter, just load it!" As a result, over 50 bags were damaged by moisture upon unloading. Under the influence of this disregard for business work, the leadership also failed to conduct political and ideological education among the employees. This year, the effort to transport grain for disaster relief during the second quarter was a glorious political task for railway workers, but the leadership did not conduct any publicity or mobilization work among the employees. Consequently, many business workers did not understand the great significance of their work, and they adopted a "get it transported and be done with it" attitude. Before accepting the consignment, some employees also failed to explain railway regulations to the cargo owners, neglected to instruct them to dry and repackage wet grain before shipping, and did not carefully inspect the condition of the tarpaulins. Grain should be transported in boxcars or open cars covered with tarpaulins, but some stations violated regulations by using livestock cars, while others used "rain-protected" boxcars to transport grain without covering them with tarpaulins; some used tarpaulins of poor quality for covering. For example, a car of rice shipped from Nanning Station to Yutaotao Station on June 29th had 198 kilograms damaged by moisture. An inspection revealed that the tarpaulin had 232 holes and patches of various sizes. On May 4th, Nanning Station shipped 394 bags of rice to Shanghai, using livestock cars for transportation, resulting in 23 bags being damaged by moisture; 349 bags were loaded in "rain-protected" cars, resulting in 52 bags being damaged by moisture. On May 19th, a car of rice shipped from Renzhuyou Station to Songjiang Station was found to have 90 bags damaged by moisture and sprouting upon unloading.

Secondly, some employees did not strictly implement the supervision system, mistakenly believing: "State-owned enterprises will not make mistakes in counting the number of items," and relying on cargo owners to count and prepare shipments themselves. Some cargo owners, on the other hand, adopted the attitude of "the railway is fully responsible, and the railway will compensate for any accidents," resulting in many accidents of insufficient quantity. For example, three cars of rice shipped from Lucun Station to Wuchang on April 4th were found to be short 104 items upon unloading.

In addition, the business department's rules and regulations were lax. Some loading and unloading workers drank alcohol on duty, left their posts without permission, did not listen to the weigher's business leadership during work, and even threw goods around recklessly. To load more, they emphasized quantity over quality, which was also a reason for the large number of business accidents.

The leading cadres of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau responsible for transportation were aware of all these problems, but rarely studied the root causes of the accidents and found ways to prevent them, only sitting in their offices "handling cases," and their on-site visits were only a formality. In the second quarter, the number of cars loaded more than doubled compared to the first quarter, and some stations increased by more than two times, but the transportation department did not promptly address the difficulties of manpower and equipment on-site.

Under the urging of the employees, the bureau convened a business work conference on July 15th, but it lacked serious analysis and realistic methods. Therefore, in July, more than 131,000 kilograms of grain were still damaged by moisture. August was slightly better, but 95,500 kilograms were still damaged by moisture. The situation worsened in October, with more than 128,000 kilograms damaged by moisture in one month. The employees believe that in the future, with the attention of the bureau, the transportation department should further study the situation and strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the employees, as well as education on rules and regulations and labor discipline, so as to gradually reduce business accidents.

### 柳州铁路管理局商务事故严重  第二季度湿损粮食一万多包，现在情况还没有好转

    柳州铁路管理局商务事故严重  
    第二季度湿损粮食一万多包，现在情况还没有好转
    柳州铁路管理局经常发生商务事故。据统计，第二季度就发生了四百五十五件商务事故，其中件数不符占三百零二件，湿损事故一百零九件。仅粮食就湿损一万三千五百四十一包，共一百一十七万五千多公斤，约损失十七亿七千余万元。
    柳州铁路管理局的一些领导干部对商务工作一向不够重视，平日很少过问和检查商务工作，一些车站站长认为：“出了行车事故，重的记过，轻的检讨；出了商务事故，最多是赔偿。”对商务工作放任自流。如有一次紫溪站装粮食，司磅员发现篷布有三十多个小洞，告诉站长说不能盖，站长说：“没关系，才几公里路，转过弯就到了。”全县站有一次装八车粮食，其中有三个车漏雨，装卸工人告诉司磅员，司磅员却说：“漏点雨没关系，你们装吧！”结果到卸车时湿损了五十多包。在轻商务的思想支配之下，该局领导上也就不可能对职工进行政治、思想教育。今年第二季度开展运粮救灾工作，这是铁路工作者一件光荣的政治任务，但该局领导上没有在职工中进行任何宣传鼓动工作，因而很多商务工作人员不懂得自己的工作的重大意义，他们对工作抱着“运出去完事”的态度。在承运前，部分职工也不向货主说明铁路规章，不说明湿了的粮食要晒干再包装托运，也不认真检查篷布情况。装运粮食，应该用棚车及敞车加盖篷布，但有些站违章使用牲畜车，有的用“雨”字棚车装粮食而不加盖篷布；有的则用质量不良的篷布加盖。像六月二十九日由南宁站发鲇鱼套站一车稻子，湿损一百九十八公斤，经检查该车篷布有大小破洞及缝补处二百三十二处。五月四日南宁站发往上海三百九十四包稻子，使用牲畜车装运，结果湿损二十三包；用“雨”字车装三百四十九包，湿损五十二包。五月十九日由稔竹油站发松江站一车稻子，到卸时发现有九十包湿损发芽。
    其次，有些职工不严格地执行监装制度，他们错误地认为：“国营企业货主，不致搞错件数”，依靠货主自行清点发筹。而一些货主又抱着“铁路包干，出了事故铁路赔”的态度，结果造成许多件数不足的事故。如四月四日由卢村站发武昌三车稻子，卸时短少了一百零四件。
    此外，商务部门规章制度松弛，一些装卸职工当班喝酒，擅离岗位，工作中不听司磅员业务领导，甚至乱摔货物；为了多装，重量不重质，也是造成大量商务事故的一个原因。
    所有这些问题，柳州铁路管理局负责运输的领导干部是知道的，但很少研究事故根源，找出防止事故的办法，只坐在办公室里“处理案件”，下现场也只是形式。第二季度装车数比第一季度增加一倍多，有的站增加两倍多，运输处也不及时解决现场人力及设备的困难。
    在职工督促下，七月十五日该局召开了全局商务工作会议，但缺乏认真的分析，更缺乏实事求是的办法，所以七月份仍湿损粮食十三万一千多公斤。八月稍好，但也湿损了九万五千五百公斤。十月情况转坏，一个月湿损了十二万八千多公斤。职工们认为今后必须在管理局的重视下，运输处应更进一步研究情况，并加强对职工的政治思想领导，加强规章制度与劳动纪律的教育，这样才能逐渐减少商务事故。
