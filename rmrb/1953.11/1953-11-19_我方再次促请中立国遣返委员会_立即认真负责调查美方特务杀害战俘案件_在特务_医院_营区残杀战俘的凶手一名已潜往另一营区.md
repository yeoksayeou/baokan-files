Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th – The Korean-Chinese side urged the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 15th to immediately conduct a conscientious and responsible investigation into the cases of U.S. special agents killing our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation, and to severely punish the murderers of the prisoners of war. At present, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has conducted a preliminary investigation into the case of special agents in Camp No. 28 killing Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner Zhang Zilong, and has only just begun to prepare for an investigation into the case of special agents in Hospital Camp No. 44 killing Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner Zhang Liutai. However, in Camp No. 55, there was a case of special agents killing a Korean People's Army prisoner of war and leaving his body at the camp gate, and in Camp No. 53, there was a case of special agents injuring two Korean People's Army prisoners of war, resulting in the death of one and serious injuries to the other. These two cases have not yet been seriously investigated and dealt with.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th – Xia Daming, one of the murderers of the Zhang surname volunteer prisoner of war in Camp No. 44 of the Dongchang-ri "Hospital" Camp, has now fled to the "First Regiment" (Camp B). This was reported by Yu Hui Ru, a returnee from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who crossed the barbed wire fence from Camp No. 44 demanding repatriation.

Yu Hui Ru said that around the morning of October 27th or 28th, Xia Daming suddenly packed his luggage. After lunch, several "representatives" from the First Regiment came, and after they talked with special agent elements such as Deng Hongxun from Camp No. 44, Xia Daming carried his luggage and left with them.

On October 1st, after Deng Hongxun ordered the killing of the Zhang surname prisoner of war, Xia Daming and guard squad leader Xu Lingui dragged the Zhang surname prisoner of war, who was tied to bed No. 41, off the bed and dragged him to a corner of the tent. Xia Daming tied his hands behind his back, and Xu Lingui used a wooden stick removed from the canvas bed to strike the Zhang surname prisoner of war head-on, knocking him to the ground. Xia Daming and Xu Lingui then continued to beat his head and shoulders, hitting him more than twenty times in total. Special agent Deng Hongxun also went up and kicked him a few times. Later, these murderers carried the Zhang surname prisoner of war to the bed, and Xia Daming personally placed a stick under his neck, and Xu Lingui placed another stick at his throat, each pressing down on one end of the stick, strangling the Zhang surname prisoner of war to death.

    我方再次促请中立国遣返委员会
    立即认真负责调查美方特务杀害战俘案件
    在特务“医院”营区残杀战俘的凶手一名已潜往另一营区
   【新华社开城十七日电】朝中方面在十五日促请中立国遣返委员会立即对美方特务杀害坚持遣返的我方被俘人员的案件进行认真负责的调查，严惩杀害战俘的凶犯。目前，中立国遣返委员会对第二十八号营场特务杀害中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙案件进行了初步调查，对第四十四号医院营场特务杀害中国人民志愿军被俘人员张六泰案件才着手准备调查。但在第五十五号营场曾发生特务杀害一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员后将其尸体放在营场门口的案件，在第五十三号营场曾发生特务伤害两名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，使其中一人死亡，另一人受重伤的案件。这两起案件迄今尚未进行认真的调查和处理。
    【新华社开城十八日电】东场里“医院”营区第四十四号营场中谋杀张姓志愿军战俘的凶手之一夏大明，现已潜往“第一联队”（B号营区）。这是从第四十四号营场越过铁丝网要求遣返的中国人民志愿军归来人员余辉如报告的。
    余辉如说，大约在十月二十七日或二十八日的上午，夏大明突然把行李捆好了。吃过午饭，第一联队就来了几个“代表”，他们和第四十四号营场的特务分子邓鸿勋等谈过话以后，夏大明就背起行李和他们一起走了。
    十月一日，邓鸿勋下令杀死张姓战俘后，夏大明就和警备班长徐林贵把绑在第四十一号床位上的张姓战俘拉下床来，拖到帐篷的一角。夏大明把他双手反翦在背后，徐林贵用从帆布床上卸下的木棍，劈头把这个姓张的战俘打倒在地。夏大明和徐林贵以后又继续打他的头和肩部，一共打了二十多棍。特务邓鸿勋也上去猛踢了他几脚。后来，这些凶犯们把姓张的战俘抬到床上，夏大明亲手把一根棍子放在他颈下，徐林贵把另一根棍子放在他喉咙口，各人揿住棍子的一端，把姓张的战俘活活夹死。
