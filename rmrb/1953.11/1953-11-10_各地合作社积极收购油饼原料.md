Cooperatives in Various Regions Actively Purchase Oilseed Cake Raw Materials

Currently, oilseed cake raw materials such as cottonseed, sesame, peanuts, and soybeans have generally entered the market. Cooperatives in various regions are combining the purchase of grain and cotton with the acquisition of oilseed cake raw materials to prepare for next year's fertilizer supply work.

Not long ago, cooperative leading organs in the Central South, East China, and other regions, as well as Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Henan, and other provinces, held fertilizer work meetings. These meetings summarized this year's fertilizer work and studied next year's fertilizer supply plan and issues such as purchasing oilseed cake raw materials this winter and securing local fertilizer sources. For example, the Central South Region Cooperative Fertilizer Work Conference tentatively determined that the supply of commercial fertilizer next year should increase by 9.4% compared to this year, requiring all provinces in the region to secure 70% to 80% of the raw materials before the end of the lunar year, according to the annual purchase plan. The Anhui Provincial Cooperative Federation also held a soybean professional meeting in August, making specific arrangements for soybean purchasing work.

In Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, and other regions, the peak season for marketing oilseed soybeans, sesame, etc., began last month, and cooperatives in these regions are actively carrying out purchasing work. In early October, the amount of soybeans purchased in Shandong Province increased by 103.6% compared to late September. In Henan Province, the purchase volume of miscellaneous grains in the first three days of mid-October increased by 18.81% compared to the last three days of early October, with soybeans accounting for the majority. Farmers in Anhui Province are quite enthusiastic about selling soybeans. In mid-to-late October, the Huaiyuan County Cooperative in the province purchased about 500,000 jin of soybeans every day, and the Yanghu Cooperative in Yingshang County purchased 2.24 million jin of soybeans in ten days. By October 20, the amount of soybeans purchased in the province accounted for about 30% of the total annual purchase task. The amount of soybeans and sesame sold by farmers in Hebei Province has also increased. In Henan Province, which has the largest sesame production in the country, new sesame has entered the market in large quantities. The average daily market volume of sesame in Xinyang Prefecture alone is more than 2 million jin. The purchase volume of the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Oil Company generally accounts for more than 80% of the total sesame market volume.

Cooperatives in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei and Zhejiang provinces are actively purchasing cottonseed. The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Federation requires cooperatives in cotton-producing areas throughout the province to complete 80% of the cottonseed purchase plan before the end of the year. Some areas have increased the amount of seed cotton purchased in order to control cottonseed.

While purchasing oilseed cake raw materials, cooperatives in various regions are also actively organizing processing forces to prepare for timely fertilizer processing work. According to statistics from cooperatives in 20 counties and one city in Guangdong Province, they have directly controlled 387 oil presses. The Anxiang County Cooperative in Hunan Province has established contact with most of the oil pressing workshops in the county and is preparing to uniformly sign contracts for fertilizer processing.

Currently, cooperatives in some regions do not pay enough attention to the preparation for next year's fertilizer supply. For example, the Xiangyang Prefecture Cooperative in Hubei Province did not purchase sesame vigorously in a timely manner when sesame was on the market in large quantities, resulting in the outflow of some oilseed cake raw materials. Some cooperatives believe that it is still early and hold the view that it is not too late to prepare in the spring, and do not actively carry out the purchase of cake fertilizer raw materials. These ideas and practices that ignore the preparation for fertilizer this winter will inevitably lead to passivity in next year's fertilizer supply work, and all regions should pay attention to correcting them.

### 各地合作社积极收购油饼原料

    各地合作社积极收购油饼原料
    目前，棉籽、芝麻、花生、大豆等油饼原料已普遍上市，各地合作社正结合收购粮食、棉花，展开油饼原料收购工作，为明年肥料供应工作作准备。
    不久以前，中南、华东等区和山东、河北、湖北、江苏、河南等省合作社领导机关曾分别召开肥料工作会议，总结今年肥料工作，研究了明年肥料供应计划和今冬收购油饼原料、掌握地方肥源等问题。如中南区合作社肥料工作会议初步确定明年商品肥料供应数量要比今年增加百分之九点四，要求全区各省在今年阴历年前按照全年的收购计划掌握百分之七十到八十的原料。安徽省合作总社还在八月份召开了一次大豆专业会议，对收购大豆工作作了具体布置。
    山东、河南、安徽、河北等地油料大豆、芝麻等，从上月开始进入上市旺季，这些地区的合作社等积极展开收购工作。山东省十月上旬收购大豆的数量，比九月下旬增加百分之一百零三点六。河南省十月中旬前三天内杂粮收购量比上旬后三天增加了百分之十八点八一，其中大部分是大豆。安徽省农民出售大豆相当踊跃。该省怀远县合作社在十月中、下旬，每天收购大豆约五十万斤，颍上县杨湖合作社十天收购大豆二百二十四万斤；到十月二十日，全省收购大豆数量，约占全年收购总任务的百分之三十。河北省农民出售大豆、芝麻的数量也有增加。全国芝麻产量最大的河南省，新芝麻已大量上市。仅信阳专区平均每日上市芝麻就有二百多万斤。河南省供销合作社和油脂公司收购数量，一般占芝麻总上市量的百分之八十以上。
    河北、浙江等省产棉地区的合作社正在积极收购棉籽。浙江省合作总社要求全省产棉区合作社在年前完成收购棉籽计划的百分之八十。有些地区增加了收籽棉的数量，以便掌握棉籽。
    在收购油饼原料的同时，各地合作社还积极组织加工力量，准备及时进行肥料加工工作。广东省据二十个县和一个市合作社的统计，已直接掌握了三百八十七条油榨。湖南省安乡县合作社已与县内大部油榨坊建立联系，准备统一签订合同，加工制肥。
    目前，部分地区的合作社对明年供应肥料的准备工作还不够重视。例如湖北省襄阳专区合作社在芝麻大量上市时，没有及时大力收购，致使部分油饼原料外流。有的合作社认为时间尚早，抱着明春准备还不晚的思想，不积极进行饼肥原料的收购工作。这些忽视今冬肥料准备的思想和作法，势必会造成明年肥料供应工作的被动，各地应注意纠正。
