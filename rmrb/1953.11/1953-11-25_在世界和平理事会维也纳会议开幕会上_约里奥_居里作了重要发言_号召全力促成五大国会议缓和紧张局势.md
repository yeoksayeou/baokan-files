Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the opening of the World Peace Council meeting in Vienna on November 23, World Peace Council President Joliot-Curie delivered a long speech.

Joliot-Curie said in his speech: At the opening of this meeting, I fully realize the great significance of the ties that unite us, which are built on the basis of our common will for peace, and are constantly strengthened in the often arduous but always inspiring struggle. We are deeply aware of our responsibility to the most sublime aspirations of the people of all countries. Therefore, we often set ourselves a goal: to use just and effective actions to advance the great world peace movement. On the platform of the World Peace Council, and on the platform of the great conferences it has proposed to convene, the desire for peace of the broadest social strata of the world has been expressed very sincerely and very clearly.

In order to change the international situation in a direction favorable to peace, all people must bear a common responsibility; some people, in addition to this, must bear a special responsibility. The extensive movement we launched in response to the Stockholm Declaration, calling for consultations among the five major powers, and our resolution on disarmament, as well as the current movement we are launching in response to the Budapest Declaration calling for the settlement of international issues through consultation—are all actions of this nature.

Due to the development of events in recent months, the international situation clearly shows that some countries and their national movements, in addition to bearing this common responsibility, also bear a special and very important responsibility. This responsibility requires urgent action that can play a decisive role in maintaining and consolidating peace. For example, the actions of Germany's neighbors against the European Defense Community or against the rearmament of militarist Germany in any other form, and the actions of Asian countries and countries concerned with resolving the Korean issue and ending the Vietnam War, raise the responsibilities of certain countries in the struggle for peace.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the practitioners of the policy of strength are doing their best to confuse public opinion. Therefore, the task of peace fighters is to conduct explanatory work by putting forward accurate and convincing arguments based on an objective study of the facts.

He said that we need to deal with a powerful group that possesses some of the skilled cold war weapons skillfully used by the Psychological Strategy Board. We often need to fight against lies and conspiracies. Recent developments fully illustrate the nature and diversity of the means they use to obstruct agreements. The development of the situation shows that they can put forward some suggestions on consultation, but their purpose is far from what the people of all countries eagerly expect, and far from the sincere efforts made by the people of all countries to seek a decision acceptable to everyone. For us, consultation is very important, and its only victory is peace. The people of all countries believe that consultation is a way to ease and eliminate international tensions, to end armed conflicts, to resolve international disputes, to make disarmament possible, and to organize disarmament.

Some people pretend that they are willing to negotiate, but they participate in negotiations with conditions. These conditions will inevitably undermine the consultation and will create a more reliable position of strength for them.

Joliot-Curie said that in Central Europe, the threat familiar to Germany's neighbors, the threat of German militarism, has emerged again.

Those who want to pull German militarists into an alliance have put forward various new arguments to illustrate the defensive nature of this alliance. However, these arguments are refuted by one fact: the current authorities in Bonn, Germany, with the support and encouragement of the U.S. government, have raised their territorial demands. On December 6, 1952, the Bonn Parliament passed the following resolution: "The government must notify the signatories of the European Military Treaty that the current eastern and western borders of Germany are not satisfactory to the Federal Republic."

The day after the German elections, Adenauer announced: "Europe will be built. When we have built Europe, we will give our young people what they need—a broader space for expansion."

It is quite obvious that the rearmament of militarist Germany is in line with the U.S.'s peripheral strategic policy. Rearmed Germany is full of revanchist desires and is being used as a first-class strategic base. Citizens of Western countries bordering Germany are increasingly aware that if these plans are realized, their own country's security will be threatened, because such a Germany, like it has done in the past, will attempt to expand towards these countries. This aggressive policy is being put forward under the guise of defense, but in reality, this policy is a serious threat to the security of the world. This aggressive policy seeks to disregard the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty. This aggressive policy obliterates the Potsdam Agreement, the basic principles of which could have enabled the four major powers to sign an agreement to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. The people of all countries have a responsibility to eliminate the danger of rearming militarist Germany, but the responsibility of countries bordering Germany in this regard is particularly great.

Of course, it is unprecedented to use such despicable means to confuse public opinion. For example, the French Foreign Minister, on October 29, 1953, speaking in the Senate of the Republic about the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power conference, said: "We still hope to convene such a conference, at which the Soviet Union can raise all the issues it wants to raise, especially security issues. The Soviet Union will talk about its own security, and we will talk about our security." If he had not said those words before, we would have welcomed this statement, but the words he said before shattered all hope that such a conference could be held. He firmly said: "The European Defense Community and the four-power conference are two complementary factors." However, we know that the four-power conference is a conference where "every country can raise all the issues it wants to raise"; while the European Defense Community Treaty stipulates the establishment of an armed force, which cannot but be an aggressive force, because it is pre-linked to territorial demands; the whole world knows that these demands cannot be achieved without war, and this treaty makes the unification of Germany impossible.

How can such a conference and such a treaty be said to be complementary?

As the President of the World Peace Council, I spoke to my compatriots at the meeting of the French National Peace Council. I believe that what I said at that time expressed your meaning. I said: "At present, the French people are able to make things develop in a direction favorable to peace. This is understood by all countries in the world. People will watch your ongoing movement and place hope and confidence in it. We are not isolated. The people of the world have great hopes for the French people, and they entrust us."

I emphasize the role of France in this way because the events of recent years and the existing treaties make it particularly possible for France to deliver a decisive blow and stop the trend towards war. However, all other countries bordering Germany have an equally important responsibility in this regard, and we should give the same importance to their actions and support them with the same strength and the same trust.

Joliot-Curie continued: Events in Asia, especially those related to Korea, have attracted great attention from the people of the world. An analysis of the events since the beginning of military operations proves that those who interfered in the internal affairs of the Korean people originally believed that they had sufficient strength to win by force. From the beginning, they opposed a ceasefire and disagreed with the United Nations discussing the situation with the participation of representatives from both sides of the Korean War. The forces of peace have won a great victory, enabling the cessation of military operations, and the spirit of consultation has triumphed.

Negotiations between the Americans, Chinese, and Koreans have proven possible, and the result has promoted the signing of the armistice agreement. This fact has very significant implications, and it has taken a big step on the road to easing international tensions. But other facts, such as Syngman Rhee's behavior during the armistice negotiations, the one-sided agreement signed between Syngman Rhee and the United States, and the declaration of the sixteen countries participating in the Korean War under the command of the U.S. command, all foreshadow future difficulties.

Forces that fear the easing of international tensions are now using various means to obstruct the convening of a political conference. Bilateral talks on the political conference are encountering endless difficulties. Representatives from Korea and China recently put forward a new proposal, which requires inviting neutral countries such as the Soviet Union, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Burma to participate in the political conference in order to eliminate the possibility of negotiations from a position of strength. This proposal is in line with the proposition of talks supported by the people of all countries, so all parties participating in the conference should adopt it. Someone is plotting to undermine this proposal. Isn't Dulles threatening? He said that if the Korean and Chinese sides do not accept the proposal on the composition of the political conference passed by the mechanical majority of the United Nations as it is by a certain period, then he will no longer abide by those clauses in the armistice agreement regarding the release of prisoners of war.

…Now there is also a very important issue involving all mankind. This is the issue of banning weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. Since the end of World War II, few other issues have aroused so much debate, and few other issues have aroused such enthusiastic discussions.

The World Peace Council has attached great importance to this issue on every occasion, because we know how enthusiastically world public opinion supports the Stockholm Declaration. The desire to ban weapons of mass destruction remains so strong.

Although some progress has been made in resolving this issue, it should also be recognized that various propositions are still in conflict with each other today, and the United Nations Disarmament Commission has not yet reached any effective conclusions. Some people are still using the same reasons to obstruct an agreement on banning atomic weapons. In the various proposals recently put forward in the United Nations, and in the proposal of the former French minister Mock, the fundamental contradiction of the Baruch Plan is repeated. According to the Baruch Plan, before the ban is implemented, information on all armed forces and all atomic enterprises should be provided.

After the World People's Peace Congress, I tried to figure out why the United States insisted so much on establishing an international agency to control uranium mines and atomic equipment as stipulated in the Baruch Plan. Supporters of this plan believed that they could maintain a mechanical majority favorable to them, so they insisted that this agency could only make decisions by a simple majority; this would give them a virtual monopoly on all atomic energy-related issues in the industry and economy of all countries in the world. And the proposal to conclude a convention to ban those weapons and stipulate the establishment of compulsory and effective control hindered their intentions.

The Baruch Plan, or any other similar plan, regardless of whether they mention weapons of mass destruction or disarmament, only advocates investigating armaments and implementing supervision, and does not impose on countries the obligation to reduce their armaments. Let us conduct investigations, implement supervision, and then talk—this is the meaning of this plan. Obviously, in such a tense situation, this method, which does not stipulate any other obligations, is unacceptable, because it would make the future even more uncertain and would be beneficial to the policy of strength in all aspects.

An analysis of the main events in the characteristics of the current world situation proves that it is difficult to resolve specific issues in an atmosphere of fierce international tension. In this atmosphere, some people are trying to confuse the people, and they are in great danger of being pulled over by the proposition of the Crusades.

I would very much like to have the opportunity to speak directly to all these people. I want to tell them: you are loyal to a certain system; you think—and others keep telling you—that they want to conquer you and force you to give up your way of life; saying that negotiations can only be held with the Russians when they change their system of government, and negotiations can only be held with the Chinese when they invite the general from Taiwan back.

What would you think if someone advocated that negotiations could only be held with the Americans when they abolished capitalism? Would you think this is reasonable?

Do you think that world peace is only possible when everyone has the same beliefs as you? If this is not the case, then shouldn't we seek ways to ease international tensions together with the people of the world?

Can't a meeting of representatives of the five major powers, who bear the main responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace, point out the best way to ease international tensions?

Let representatives of the five major powers gather together to eliminate suspicion and ease the atmosphere by exchanging views on their own interests and concerns, and by generally discussing those issues that cause divisions around the world.

I believe that one of the main tasks of this World Peace Council meeting is to try to find the most effective way to promote the convening of this very necessary meeting.

In order to work smoothly, it is beneficial to study the three issues included in the agenda. These issues are not to be studied one by one, but to be studied in relation to each other, because they are all related to the main issue of easing international tensions.

I believe that our work and our conclusions will produce meaning and consequences corresponding to the events that are being watched by all mankind.

    在世界和平理事会维也纳会议开幕会上
    约里奥—居里作了重要发言  
    号召全力促成五大国会议缓和紧张局势
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在十一月二十三日世界和平理事会维也纳会议开幕会上发表了长篇演说。
    约里奥—居里的演说说：在这次会议揭幕的时候，我充分体会到把我们团结在一起的联系的重大意义，这种联系在我们要求和平的共同意志的基础上建立起来，并且在往往是艰苦的但永远是令人鼓舞的斗争过程中不断地加强着。我们深深地了解到我们对于各国人民最崇高的愿望的责任。因此经常为我们自己规定一个目标：利用公正、有效的行动来推进伟大的世界和平运动。在世界和平理事会的讲台上，在它所建议召开的历次伟大的大会的讲台上，全世界最广泛的社会阶层对和平的渴望，已十分真挚、十分清楚地表现出来了。
    为了使国际局势朝着有利于和平的方向改变，所有人民必须担负起共同的责任；有些人除此以外，还要负起特别的责任。我们为了响应斯德哥尔摩宣言、要求五大国协商的号召以及我们关于裁减军备的决议而展开的广泛的运动，以及目前我们为了响应要求以协商方式解决国际问题的布达佩斯宣言而展开的运动——都是这种性质的行动。
    由于最近几个月的事件的发展，国际形势清楚地说明，有些国家以及它们的全国性运动，除了负有这种共同责任外，还负有特别的十分重要的责任。这种责任要求采取对维持和巩固和平可以起决定作用的紧急行动。例如，德国的邻国反对欧洲防务集团或反对以任何其他形式重新武装军国主义德国的行动，亚洲国家以及关心解决朝鲜问题和结束越南战争的国家的行动，在争取和平的斗争中提出了某些国家的责任。
    约里奥—居里指出，实力政策的奉行者在竭尽全力迷惑舆论。因此和平战士的任务是，依据对事实的客观研究提出确切的、具有说服力的论据，来进行解释工作。
    他说，我们需要对付一个强大的集团，这个集团拥有像心理战略局所巧妙使用的一些熟练的冷战武器。我们经常需要与谎言和阴谋进行斗争。最近的形势发展充分说明了他们为阻挠协议所使用的手段的性质和多样性。局势的发展说明，他们可以提出某些关于协商的建议，然而其目的却远非各国人民所热烈期望的，远不符合于各国人民为谋求大家能够接受的决定所作的真诚努力。对我们来说是很重要的协商，它的唯一胜利就是和平。各国人民认为协商是缓和并消除国际紧张局势的办法，是结束武装冲突、解决国际争端，使裁减军备成为可能并组织裁军的办法。
    有些人假装他们愿意协商，但是他们参加协商是有条件的。这些条件必然会破坏协商，并会为他们造成一个更可靠的实力地位。
    约里奥—居里说，在欧洲中部，德国邻国所熟悉的威胁、德国军国主义的威胁又产生了。
  想把德国军国主义者拉入一个联盟的人们曾经提出种种新的论据来说明这个联盟的防御性质。但是这些论据都被一个事实所驳倒：目前波恩德国的当权者已在美国政府的支持和鼓舞下提出了他们的领土要求。一九五二年十二月六日，波恩议会通过了如下的决议：“政府得通知欧洲军条约签字国，德国目前东西部的边界不能令联邦共和国满意”。
    德国选举后的第二天，阿登纳就宣布：“欧洲将建立起来。当我们建立起了欧洲的时候，我们就将给我们青年们以所需要的东西，——更加广阔的扩张的空间。”
    十分明显，军国主义德国的重新武装是符合于美国的外围战略政策的。重新武装起来的德国充满了复仇主义的愿望，它被作为头等的战略基地。与德国毗连的西方国家的公民愈来愈明显地感觉到，如果这些计划得以实现的话，他们本国的安全就要遭到威胁，因为这样一个德国会像它过去所做的一样，企图向这些国家扩张。这个侵略政策是在防御的藉口下被提出来的，而实际上这种政策是对全世界安全的严重威胁。这个侵略政策力图置英苏条约和法苏条约于不顾。这个侵略政策一笔勾销了波茨坦协定，这一协定的基本原则，本来可以使四大国之间签订一个建立统一、民主、和平的德国的协定的。各国人民都有责任起来消除重新武装军国主义德国的危险，但是与德国相邻的国家在这方面的责任特别重大。
    自然，用这样卑鄙的手段来迷惑舆论还是前所未有的。例如，法国外交部长一九五三年十月二十九日在共和国参议院谈到苏联关于召开四国会议的建议时说：“我们仍然希望召开这样一个会议，在这个会议上苏联可以提出它要提出的一切问题，特别是安全问题。苏联将谈论自己的安全，而我们将谈论我们的安全。”假如不是他在此以前说过的那些话，我们本来是会欢迎这种言论的，然而他在此以前说的那些话打破了这种会议可能举行的一切希望。他坚决地说：“欧洲防务集团和四国会议是相互补充的两个因素。”可是，我们知道四国会议是这样一个会议，在这个会议上“每一个国家都可以提出它要提出的一切的问题”；而欧洲防务集团条约则规定建立一支武装部队，这支武装部队不能不是一支侵略部队，因为预先就把它与领土要求联系在一起；全世界都知道，没有战争是不能达到这种要求的，这个条约使得德国的统一成为不可能。
    这样一个会议和这样一个条约怎能说是互相补充的呢？
    我曾以世界和平理事会主席的身分在法国全国和平理事会的会议上向我国同胞说过话，我相信当时我所说的话是表达了你们的意思的，我说：“目前法国人民能够使事情朝着有利于和平的方向发展，这是全世界一切国家都了解的。人们将注视你们正在进行的运动，并寄予希望和信心。我们不是孤立的，全世界人民对法国人民抱着很大的希望，他们信托我们。”
    我这样强调法国的作用，是因为最近几年的事件和现有的条约使法国特别有可能给予决定性的打击，制止战争的趋向。但是，与德国相邻的其他所有的国家在这方面同样负有十分重大的责任，对于它们的行动我们应当给予同样的重视，应当以同样的力量和同样的信任支持它们。
    约里奥—居里接着说：在亚洲发生的事件，特别是与朝鲜有关的事件，引起了全世界人民的极大的注意。分析一下军事行动开始以来的事件，就可以证明，那些干涉朝鲜人民内政的人原认为自己有足够的力量以武力取得胜利。他们一开始就反对停火，不同意联合国在有朝鲜战争双方代表的参加下讨论局势。和平力量获得了巨大的胜利，使军事行动得以停止，协商精神获得胜利。
    美国人、中国人和朝鲜人之间的谈判已证明是可能的，而且结果已经促成了停战协定的签订。这
  一事实具有非常重大的意义，它在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上走了一大步。但是另外有些事实，例如李承晚在停战谈判期间的行为，李承晚和美国签订的片面协定，以及在美国司令部统率下参加朝鲜战争的十六个国家的宣言，都预示了未来的困难。
    害怕国际紧张局势缓和的势力现在正在使用各种手段阻碍政治会议的召开。关于政治会议的双方会谈正遭到无穷的困难。朝鲜和中国的代表不久前提出了一个新的建议，这建议要求邀请像苏联、印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚和缅甸这样的中立国参加政治会议，以消除从实力立场来进行谈判的可能。这个建议是符合各国人民所支持的会谈的主张的，因此参加会议的各方应加以采纳。有人正在阴谋破坏这个建议。难道杜勒斯不是在威胁吗？他说，如果到一定时期朝中方面不按原样接受联合国机械多数所通过的关于政治会议组成的建议，那么他就不再遵守停战协定中关于释放战俘的那些条款了。
    ……现在还有一个牵涉到全体人类的非常重大的问题。这就是关于禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备的问题。从第二次世界大战结束以来，很少有其他问题引起这样多的争论，也很少有其他问题引起这样热烈的商谈。
    世界和平理事会在每一个场合中都十分重视这一问题，因为我们知道，全世界的公众舆论是多么热烈地拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言的。要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器的愿望，依然是如此的强烈。
    虽然在解决这一问题中已取得某些进展，可是还应该承认，各种主张今天仍然在互相冲突中，而联合国裁军委员会直到现在还没有得出任何有效的结论。有人仍然拿同样的理由来阻挠在禁止原子武器方面取得协议。最近在联合国中提出的各项建议中，以及在法国的前部长莫克的建议中，重复了巴鲁克计划的根本矛盾，按照巴鲁克计划，在实行禁止以前，应该提供一切武装部队和一切原子企业的情报。
    在世界人民和平大会之后，我曾设法想弄明白，究竟为什么美国那样坚持巴鲁克计划中规定建立掌握铀矿和原子设备的国际机构。这个计划的支持者相信可以保持有利于他们的机械多数，因而坚持这个机构只能以简单的多数采取决定；这样就使他们在世界各国的工业和经济方面一切与原子能有关的问题上实际上都可以垄断。而主张缔结一个公约来禁用那些武器并规定建立强制的有效管制这一建议，是阻挠了他们的意图。
    巴鲁克计划或者任何其他类似的计划，不管它们提到大规模毁灭性武器，或者提到裁减军备，只是主张调查军备和实行监督，而并不加给各国以裁减它们的军备的义务。让我们进行调查，实行监督吧，然后再说——这就是这一计划的意义。显然，在如此紧张的局势中，这种没有规定任何其他义务的办法是不能接受的，因为这样就会使前途更加渺茫，并且在各方面都对实力政策有利。
    分析一下目前世界形势特点中的主要事件，就可以证明，在激烈的国际紧张局势的气氛中，是很难解决具体问题。在这种气氛中，有人企图迷惑人民，他们大有被十字军的主张拉过去的危险。
    我很愿意有机会向所有这些人直接讲几句话，我要告诉他们：你们效忠于某种制度；你们认为——别人也喋喋不休地对你们说——他们要征服你们，要强迫你们放弃你们的生活方式；说只有当俄国人改变了他们的政府的制度的时候，才能和他们进行谈判，只有当中国人请回台湾的将军，才能和他们进行谈判。
    如果有人主张，只有当美国人废除了资本主义，才能跟他们进行谈判，你们有怎样的看法？你们会认为这是合理的吗？
    你们是否认为只有当所有的人都具有和你们同样的信念时，世界和平才有可能建立？如果不是这样的话，那么难道就不应当和世界人民共同寻求缓和国际紧张局势的办法吗？
    难道对维持和巩固和平负有主要责任的五个大国的代表的会议不能指出一条缓和国际紧张局势的最好的道路吗？
    让五大国代表聚首一堂，通过就自己的利益和忧虑交换意见，通过一般地讨论引起全世界分歧的那些问题，来消除怀疑，缓和气氛。
    我认为，这次世界和平理事会会议的主要任务之一是设法找出最有效的办法，促成这个十分必要的会议的召开。
    为了工作得顺利，研究议程所包括的三个问题是有好处的，这些问题不是要逐条加以研究，而是要相互关联地加以研究，因为它们都与缓和国际紧张局势这一主要问题有关系。
    我相信，我们的工作和我们的结论，将产生和全人类注视的那些事件相应的意义和后果。
