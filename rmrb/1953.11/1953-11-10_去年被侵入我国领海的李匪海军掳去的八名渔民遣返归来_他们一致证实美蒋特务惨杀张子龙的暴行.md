Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: Among the witnesses investigated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) in the case of special agents murdering Zhang Zilong were eight old fishermen with white hair. Seven of them were identified as witnesses by Huang Lichao and You Xuehe, volunteer returnees who testified during the second investigation conducted by the NNRC on the 2nd of this month. The remaining person escaped from Camp No. 28 by climbing the barbed wire fence on the night of October 31.

Because special agents were mixed among the witnesses, these eight old fishermen dared not say anything during the first interrogation by the NNRC personnel. During the second individual interrogation by the NNRC personnel, they tearfully accused the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents of their inhuman atrocities. Li Shihua, 59, described the terrifying situation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents’ brutal murder of Zhang Zilong on October 2: “That day, the special agents told us to go and see. We saw Zhang Zilong hanging naked from the tent pole of the Third Detachment headquarters. The flesh cut from the place where he had been tattooed was piled into a small heap, and his eyes had been stabbed blind. He was simply a bloody mess! We were all so scared that we covered our faces and dared not look. The old fisherman Zhang Shuliang fainted on the spot.” Li Shihua continued, “At dusk, the special agents picked up a piece of human liver and told us to eat it, saying, ‘This is Zhang Zilong’s liver. If you eat it, you will be resolute!’”

After testifying, these eight old fishermen all requested repatriation, and they have returned to Kaesong one after another. The oldest of them is 70 years old, and the youngest is nearly 50 years old.

They are all Chinese fishermen. On the evening of the 18th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, at around 8 p.m., while they were fishing on the sea near Dadonggou, Andong, they were kidnapped by a Rhee Syngman bandit navy speedboat that violated international law and invaded our territorial waters. At that time, a total of seventeen people were kidnapped with them. Initially, they were sent to a small island about seven li northwest of Nampo and stayed there for half a month. Four people were detained, and the remaining thirteen were sent to Busan. In mid-December, three more of them were detained, and the remaining ten were sent to Jeju Island. Two of them are still in Camp No. 28 of the NNRC custody camp.

Zhang Shuliang, a 56-year-old fisherman, recounted: In Busan, an American military officer and a Taiwanese special agent came to interrogate them, forcing them to say they wanted to go to Taiwan. When they unanimously said, “We want to go home,” the American military officer and the Taiwanese special agent threatened them, saying, “If you want to go to Taiwan, we will give you food. Otherwise, we will starve you to death.” Zhang Shuliang and Li Shihua ignored this threat and continued to express their desire to go home. The American military put them in jail and starved them for a day and a night. Afterwards, they were still forcibly sent to the Third Prisoner of War Camp on Jeju Island, which did not allow direct repatriation.

In the non-direct repatriation prisoner of war camp, these old fishermen often gathered together and cried because they missed their motherland and hometown. But the special agents did not let them go, and specially sent people to monitor them, forbidding them from talking to each other or crying. Even Yu Xiangfa, 70, who was kidnapped with them, and his son Yu Xichun were not allowed to be together. The father and son occasionally met in the toilet and could only cover their faces and weep silently. Later, the special agents deceived them, saying: Whoever wants to go home should register. Sun Caisheng, Zhang Shuliang, and Wang Xingcai believed it was true and went to register, but they were punished by the special agents with hard labor, carrying forty or fifty loads of water every day. Zhang Shuliang was old and unable to carry the loads, and was still carrying them late into the night. The special agents also often forced them to watch the torture of people who wanted to return to their country. Once, Wang Xiuqing, who lived in the same tent with them, was beaten to death for wanting to return to the country. The special agents threatened them, saying, "This is what happens if you want to return to your country!" The old fishermen were frightened every day. The old man Yu Xiangfa was so frightened that he became ill and trembled all over day and night.

In order to increase their concerns and facilitate their forced detention, the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents forcibly tattooed them, except for the oldest Yu Xiangfa, 70, and Liu Yongyi, 62. The old fisherman Sun Caisheng took off his clothes to show the reporter the Kuomintang flag and reactionary slogans tattooed on his body, and could not help but sob. He said, "My arms were forcibly tattooed with words in Jeju Island. When I got to Dongchangli, they said that my thinking was not good and that I wanted to return to my country, so they tied my hands with leather belts, one person held down my two arms, and tattooed these things on my chest and back!" The special agents also dug a large pit in the bathhouse, ready to lock Sun Caisheng, Zhang Shuliang, and Wang Xingcai, who had expressed their desire to return to their country, in the dirt pit and prevent them from going out to listen to the explanation when they went out to listen to the explanation.

    去年被侵入我国领海的李匪海军掳去的八名渔民遣返归来
    他们一致证实美蒋特务惨杀张子龙的暴行
    【新华社开城九日电】在中立国遣返委员会调查特务谋害张子龙惨案的证人里面有八位白发苍苍的老渔民。他们中间七个人是在本月二日中立国遣返委员会进行第二次调查时由作证者、志愿军归来人员黄立超与尤学和指作证人的。其余一人是在十月三十一日夜间从第二十八号营场爬铁丝网逃出来的。
    由于有特务分子混在证人中间，这八位老渔民在中立国遣返委员会人员第一次询问时甚么也不敢说。第二次，中立国遣返委员会人员进行个别询问时，他们才声泪俱下地控诉了美蒋特务惨绝人寰的暴行。五十九岁的李世华叙述十月二日蒋匪特务分子惨杀张子龙的恐怖情形说：“那天，特务们叫我们去看了，只见张子龙光着身子吊在三中队部的帐篷杆上，从他刺字的地方割下来的肉堆成了一小堆，眼睛也被刺瞎了，简直成了一个血人！我们都吓得掩住脸不敢看，老渔民张书良顿时吓昏过去。”李世华继续说，黄昏时分，特务又捡了一块人肝来叫他们吃，并说：“这是张子龙的肝，你们吃了就坚决了！”
    这八位老渔民在作证以后都要求遣返，他们已先后回到了开城。他们中间年纪最大的有七十岁，最小的也将近五十岁。
    他们都是我国渔民。他们在去年旧历七月十八日晚上八时许在安东大东沟附近海面上捕鱼时，被违反国际公法、侵入我国领海的李承晚匪军海军汽艇掳去。当时，与他们一起被掳去的共十七个人。最初，他们被送到南浦西北约七里的一个小岛上呆了半个月，扣留了四个人，剩下十三个人被送到釜山。十二月中旬，他们中间又有三个人被扣，剩下十个人被送到济州岛，现在有两个人还在中立国看管营地第二十八号营场。
    五十六岁的渔民张书良叙述说：在釜山，有一个美军军官和一个台湾特务曾来审问他们，逼迫他们说要到台湾去。当他们一致说“我们要回家”的时候，美军军官和台湾特务竟威胁他们说：“你们如果要到台湾就给你们饭吃，不然就饿死你们。”张书良和李世华不顾这种威胁，继续表示要回家，美军就把他们两个关起来饿了一天一夜。以后，仍强制把他们送到济州岛不直接遣返的第三战俘营。
    在不直接遣返的战俘营中，这些老渔民因为想念祖国和家乡，常聚在一起相对哭泣。但特务也不放松他们，专门派了人监视着，不许他们互相谈话和哭泣，连一起被掳的七十岁的于祥发和他的儿子于喜春也不许在一起。他们父子俩偶而在厕所相遇，只有掩面饮泣。后来，特务又欺骗他们说：谁要回家就登记。孙才生、张书良、王兴才三个人信以为真，跑去登记，结果却被特务罚作苦工，每天挑四、五十担水。张书良年老挑不动，直到深更半夜还在挑。特务也经常强迫他们去看拷打要回国的人。有一次和他们在一个帐篷里住的王秀卿因为要回国被活活打死后，特务就威胁他们说：“要回国就是这个样子！”吓得这些老渔民天天心惊肉跳。老人于祥发因而吓出病来，日夜不停地浑身颤抖。
    美蒋特务为了增加他们的顾虑以便于强迫扣留他们，除了年纪最大的七十岁的于祥发和六十二岁的刘永毅以外，都强迫刺了字。老渔民孙才生脱下衣服给记者看他身上刺的国民党旗子和反动口号时，禁不住泣不成声。他说：“我的膀子上早在济州岛时就被强迫刺上字了。到了东场里他们说我思想不好，要回国，又把我的双手用皮带捆住，一个人一边按住我的两条膀子，在我胸前背后刺上了这些东西！”特务们还在澡堂里挖好了一个大坑，准备在出去听解释时就把曾经表示过要回国的孙才生、张书良、王兴才三人关在土坑里，不让他们出去听解释。
