    The Misfortune of 40,000 Catties of Grapes
    By our reporter Wang Xi
    Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Enterprise Company's storefront suddenly posted an advertisement for "Cheap Sale of Xuanhua Grapes." An enterprise company selling grapes? This was truly a strange and puzzling matter.
    From this, people investigated a case of wasting state wealth.
    The Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Canned Food Factory had always only produced canned meat. This year, in July, the factory began preparing to manufacture a new product – canned fruit. For over a month, the factory was busy researching changes to equipment, conducting research on fruits, and collecting samples of canned fruits produced by various canned food factories across the country for study. In early August, instructions were issued from higher authorities: actively prepare so that after October, fruit and jam cans could be officially manufactured according to new order contracts. The new production task brought great excitement to the factory's employees, and the cadres were very enthusiastic. Although the new order contract had not yet determined what varieties or specifications were required, the factory was already actively negotiating the purchase of various fruits. The factory held a factory affairs meeting, and the factory director and workshop directors together decided: taking advantage of the time when grapes are massively on the market, immediately send people to Xuanhua to order a train carload of grapes.
    More than 40,000 catties of grapes were shipped from Xuanhua. However, the stainless steel pots needed for making canned fruit were still being manufactured in the machine factory and would not be delivered for another month or two; the finished product testing methods were still under discussion; the technical problems in production had not yet been resolved; and whether the factory's subjective conditions actually allowed for the large-scale manufacture of canned fruit had not been answered by product trial production... How could the production of canned grapes begin?
      A day or two later, the warehouse keeper issued an urgent alarm to the factory director: the grapes are starting to leak, if they are not dealt with quickly, they will all turn into waste!
    At this time, the factory director became flustered and went everywhere to find places to sell the 40,000 catties of grapes. The department store refused to purchase them because it had already stocked enough goods for the festival; private warehouses saw an opportunity and wanted to greatly lower the price... Without other simple and quick solutions, the factory director had no choice but to send people everywhere to set up fruit stalls in the market (with the consent of the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce), and the employees had to temporarily act as fruit vendors; the enterprise company's storefront gave up a corner, and various government agencies and organizations also assisted in promoting sales to employees. After a few busy days, fortunately, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, so 20,000 catties were sold. The remaining half had to endure even greater damage and loss, and only after the Mid-Autumn Festival was it completely disposed of.
    The result of the accounting: the purchase price of more than 40,000 catties of grapes was 80 million yuan, and excluding the waste of labor, the total loss was more than 15 million yuan!
    People cannot help but question the factory's leadership: It is a well-known fact that grapes cannot be stored for a long time, but why did the factory affairs meeting decide to buy so much so hastily without any consideration? The manufacturing of new products must go through sufficient production preparation work and should be tested. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department had already given instructions. Why, knowing that these conditions were not yet met, did they want to manufacture canned grapes in large quantities? When changing product manufacturing and purchasing raw materials in large quantities, why didn't the factory affairs meeting report to the higher-level leadership organs until the grapes had already begun to rot? How is this treating the reporting system? The factory's leading cadres could not answer, and could only admit: "We only subjectively and blindly wanted to produce new products as soon as possible, and did not consider the subjective conditions; we wanted to increase wealth for the country, but as a result, the country's wealth suffered an unnecessary loss." However, it is even more important to earnestly learn from the lessons.
    To achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy for the country, one cannot rely solely on enthusiasm; one must carry out work in accordance with higher-level instructions and the state plan; blind activism will only spoil good things. This is the greatest lesson of the 40,000 catties of grapes incident.

    四万斤葡萄的厄运
    本报记者　汪溪
    中秋节前，天津市地方国营企业公司门市部，忽然贴出了“宣化葡萄廉价出售”的广告。企业公司出售葡萄？真是件叫人诧异的蹊跷事儿。
    从这里，人们追究出一桩浪费国家财富的事件。
    天津市地方国营罐头食品工厂，一向只生产肉食罐头。今年七月该厂开始准备制造新产品——水果罐头了。一个多月中，厂里在忙于研究改变设备、对水果进行调查研究，又搜集了国内各罐头工厂出产的水果罐头样品，进行研究。八月初，上级发下了指示：积极做好准备，以便在十月以后，正式按新订货合同制造水果及果酱罐头。新的生产任务给厂里职工带来了极大的兴奋，干部们劲头很大。虽然新订货合同要什么品种、何种规格，还没有确定，厂里已经在积极地进行洽购各种水果了。厂里召开了厂务会议，厂长和车间主任们一起作了决定：趁着葡萄大量上市的时候，立即派人去宣化订购一火车皮的葡萄。
    四万多斤葡萄从宣化运来了。可是，制水果罐头需要的不锈钢锅还在机器工厂里制造，要一两个月后才到交货期限；成品化验办法还在磋商中；生产中的技术问题还没有把握解决；根据厂里的主观条件到底能不能大量制造水果罐头，还没有经过产品试制得到答案……。怎样开始生产葡萄罐头呢？
      一两天后，仓库保管人员向厂长发出了紧急的警报：葡萄开始流水了，如不赶快处理，就将全部变成废物！
    这时，厂长着了忙，到处去找能出售这四万斤葡萄的地方。百货公司因供应节日的进货已足，拒绝收购；私营货栈见有机可乘，想大大压低价格……。没有其他简便迅速的办法，厂长只好四处派人，在市场上摆起水果摊子（经市工商局同意），职工们不得不权且充当贩卖水果的摊贩；企业公司的门市部出让了一角地方，各机关团体也协助向职工推销。忙了几天，幸而正值中秋节日，才卖掉了二万斤。剩余的半数更不得不忍受了更大的损耗和损失，在中秋节后，才处理完毕。
    结算账目的结果：四万多斤葡萄买价八千余万元，除人力浪费不算外，共损失一千五百余万元！
    人们不禁要向该厂领导发出疑问：葡萄不能长期储存，这是尽人皆知的事实，而厂务会议为何竟毫不加考虑如此草率地决定大量买进？制造新产品必须经过充分的生产准备工作，并应经过试制，中共天津市委工业部早曾有过指示，为什么明知还没有具备这样条件，就想大批制造葡萄罐头呢？在改制产品，大批购买原料时，厂务会议竟不向上级领导机关请示，直到葡萄已开始腐烂，才向上级报告，这又是怎样对待请示报告制度的呢？厂的领导干部无以答对，只能承认：“我们只主观地盲目地想早日制出新产品来，没有考虑主观条件；想为国家增加财富，结果，反而使国家财富遭受了不应有的损失。”但是，更重要的是要切实接受教训。
    要达到为国家增产节约的目的，绝不能光凭热情；必须按照上级指示，按国家计划来进行工作；盲目积极性只会把好事办坏。这就是四万斤葡萄这一事件的最大教训。
