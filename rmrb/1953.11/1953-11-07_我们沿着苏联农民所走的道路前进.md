    We Advance Along the Road Taken by Soviet Peasants
    Agricultural Labor Model Han En
    With the restoration and development of the motherland's production, millions of peasants have actively participated in various forms of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, following the road of "getting organized" as instructed by our great leader Chairman Mao. This has greatly developed our agricultural production. Take our agricultural production cooperative as an example. In the year the People's Republic of China was founded, we were still a mutual aid team of twenty-two households. Last year, our mutual aid team became an agricultural production cooperative of twenty-five households. Due to the unified management of land and collective labor, production developed rapidly. Although we suffered a severe hailstorm in 1952, we still maintained a normal harvest, averaging 5,500 jin of grain per hectare, an increase of 162.3 percent compared to pre-liberation. We bought twenty-two sturdy horses, seven head of cattle, and four brand-new rubber-wheeled carts, and accumulated more than 100 million yuan in public property. All members have new clothes and surplus grain, and are living a life of plenty. Every member is working happily and singing happily: "...Just because the mutual aid team is well-run, the foundation of the cooperative is deeply rooted... Scattered plots of land are connected, scattered mules and horses are grouped together, new farm tools are powerful, and patriotic grain production increases by hundreds of tons...". Because the agricultural production cooperative is superior to the mutual aid team in all aspects, it has attracted the surrounding peasants to request membership. We have now expanded the cooperative to forty-seven households, and the land has increased from 49 hectares to 85 hectares.
    Over the past four years, we have deeply realized that only under the correct leadership of the Party, gradually moving towards the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and finally developing into agricultural collectivization, can peasants completely get rid of the past hardships.
    However, in the past, we did not understand the specific situation of the socialist collective farm and had many confused ideas. Some members mistakenly believed that socialism was "everything lumped together and eating from the same pot," and that "the property of rich households is nationalized, and the poor will have money to use." Some members were also afraid that they would not be able to afford tractors to plow the land in a socialist society. Last year, when I visited the Soviet Union, I deeply realized the superiority of socialist agriculture. Agricultural production on collective farms, from sowing to harvesting, is done by machines. I saw clearly that the socialist collective farm is neither everything lumped together, nor is it a place where you can eat without working. The grain and money earned by the members in a year are distributed according to the socialist principle of "more work, more gain; less work, less gain; no work, no gain." They have only one goal, which is to continuously improve and raise agricultural technology and increase crop yields. The land they cultivate and the machines used in agricultural production (such as tractors, threshers, etc.) are all state-owned; while the members' small plots of land, dairy cows, fruit trees, etc., are all owned by the members themselves. Because of the large-scale use of machinery, production has been highly developed, and the material and cultural lives of the members have been greatly improved. They eat bread and canned food, drink milk and soda, and most of them wear serge and woolen clothes. In labor and production, they are picked up and dropped off by car every day they go to work. After a day's work, they have enough entertainment and rest time. The members are so strong and live such a happy and fulfilling life.
    After returning from my visit to the Soviet Union, I gave dozens of reports on my impressions of the Soviet Union to peasants throughout the province. This played a significant role in reversing the peasants' mistaken understanding that socialism is everything lumped together and eating from the same pot, and in establishing the correct idea of further learning from the Soviet Union. All the peasants who heard the report said that they would work hard and follow the path of the Soviet peasants. Zhang Xikui, an old member of our cooperative who used to dislike hearing about socialism, also said: "This time, I am convinced."
    The advanced production technologies and production experiences accumulated by the great Soviet people in all aspects are our role models. They will play a huge role in promoting China's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Take our agricultural production cooperative as an example: When our cooperative began trial operations last year, many problems arose in the organization and division of labor and the calculation of workdays. During summer weeding, due to the lack of a fixed labor organization and improper allocation of labor, more than 150 workdays were wasted. During the autumn harvest, due to the unscientific calculation of workdays, some members had the bad tendency of "avoiding heavy work and choosing easy work" in production. Later, when I returned from my visit to the Soviet Union, I brought back the advanced experience of Soviet collective farms in production quotas and division of labor. After repeated discussions by all members, it was decided that from this year's spring plowing, we would begin to implement the method of permanent contracting by teams and a three-level quota system: The 84 members of the cooperative were divided into three production teams (one paddy field team and two dry field teams) according to their technical skill and physical strength. During spring plowing, six laborers were drawn from the two dry field teams to form a technical group, specializing in the use of new farm tools. Each team contracted a fixed area of cultivated land with a fixed labor force to complete the work plan on time. In addition, during busy farming seasons or in special circumstances, the cooperative's production management committee would temporarily allocate labor in a unified manner according to the specific conditions of each team. Secondly, all the tasks in the cooperative throughout the year were divided into three levels, according to the specific conditions of lightness, heaviness, simplicity, complexity, difficulty, and the technology required, specifying the requirements for quantity, quality, and time. The difference between each level was two points (Level 1: 12 points per day, Level 2: 10 points, Level 3: 8 points). In this way, the cooperative's labor force was properly used and reasonably calculated. Not only was the production responsibility system implemented throughout the year, but also the flexibility in the use of labor was strengthened, ensuring the timely cultivation of various crops. It also changed the waste of labor caused by idling, absenteeism, and the lack of responsibility for production in the past, increasing the cooperative's labor efficiency by about 35 to 40 percent. This year, the wheat sown by the cooperative using the advanced Soviet experience of cross-sowing, although it suffered from natural disasters, still yielded an average of 4,000 jin per hectare, an increase of 1,000 jin per hectare compared to last year. The autumn crops were originally growing well, but they were eventually hit by a severe frost, and it is estimated that production will be reduced. However, the members were not discouraged at all and quickly formulated a plan to increase production and save, striving to make up for the loss of the poor harvest.
    The members all know that the achievements of our agricultural production cooperative are inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and the help of the Soviet Union. Production team leader Liang Naitang said: "With the help of the Soviet Union, our cooperative has been using horse-drawn farm tools to cultivate the land since 1950, which has improved farming efficiency and increased grain production. If it weren't for the help of the Soviet Union, we would not be able to get rid of the curved-handle plow in our lifetime." When everyone mentions the happy life of the Soviet collective farm peasants, they love the Soviet collective farm even more and yearn for such a collective farm. We often think like this: If we do a good job in the agricultural production cooperative, aren't we seeing the edge of socialism right before our eyes? Thinking of this, everyone feels even more motivated. Niu Guizhi, an 18-year-old girl, often says: "Now I want to work hard and study hard, and become a tractor driver in a socialist society in the future, and learn from Comrade Angelina, the leader of the Soviet labor hero tractor team." Old member Niu Defang also said: "Even though I am 56 years old this year, I must work hard, I still want to live the life of a collective farm!" Now the members have all moved into new houses built by themselves, and in front of the new houses, they are also preparing to build a fish pond about 18 meters wide and 220 meters long. The members are very happy to have moved into the new houses. Male and female members constantly sing the superiority of getting organized, singing about the happy life of the future: "...We have strength, we have confidence, we divide and cooperate, we work together, we work harder and harder, we are heading towards the collective farm, towards socialism, we are taking big steps forward."

    我们沿着苏联农民所走的道路前进
    农业劳动模范　韩　恩
    随着祖国生产的恢复和发展，千百万农民都按照我们伟大领袖毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路，积极参加了各种形式的互助合作组织。这使我们的农业生产大大发展了。就拿我们的农业生产合作社来说，中华人民共和国成立那年，我们还是一个二十二户的互助组，去年我们的互助组就变成了二十五户的农业生产合作社。由于土地的统一经营，劳动的集体性，很快地发展了生产。一九五二年虽然遭受了严重雹灾，可是仍然保住了常年收成，平均每垧地还打了五千五百斤粮，比解放前增产百分之一百六十二点三。我们买了二十二匹膘肥大马，七头大牛和四辆崭新的胶皮轱辘车，积攒了一亿多元的公共财产；社员人人有新衣，户户有余粮，都过上了丰衣足食的生活。每个社员都在愉快地劳动，愉快地歌唱：“……只因为互助组办得好，合作社的根才扎得深……零块的土地连成片，分散的骡马合成了群，新式农具力量大，爱国粮增产几百吨……”。由于农业生产合作社各方面都比互助组更为优越，吸引了周围的农民纷纷要求入社。我们现在把社又扩大到四十七户，土地由四十九垧增加到八十五垧了。
    四年来：我们深深地体会到：只有在党的正确领导下，逐步走向互助合作的道路，最后发展到农业集体化，农民才能彻底摆脱过去的苦难日子。
    但是，过去我们对于社会主义集体农庄的具体情况不了解，有很多糊涂思想。部分社员错误地认为社会主义就是“归大堆，吃大锅饭”，“富裕户的财产归公，穷人也就有钱用了”。有的社员还怕自己到了社会主义社会买不起拖拉机耕地。去年，我到苏联参观，深深体会到社会主义农业的优越性，集体农庄的农业生产，由播种一直到收割，都是用机器。我看清楚了：社会主义的集体农庄，既不是归大堆，也不是不劳动就有饭吃。庄员们一年劳动所得的粮和钱，都是按照社会主义的分配原则“多劳多得，少劳少得，不劳不得”进行分配的。他们只有一个目标，就是不断地改进和提高农业技术，提高农作物的收获量。他们耕种的土地和农业生产上使用的机器（如拖拉机、脱谷机等）都是国有的；而庄员们各家的小块园地、奶牛、果树等等都归庄员自己所有。他们由于大规模地使用了机器，生产有了高度的发展，庄员们的物质、文化生活也大大提高了，吃的是面包和罐头，喝的是牛奶和汽水，穿的大多数都是哔叽和呢子衣服；他们在劳动生产上，每天下地干活都用汽车接送，在一天的劳动结束以后，都有足够的娱乐和休息时间，庄员们都是那样健壮，过着那样美满幸福的生活。
    我从苏联参观回来以后，把我所看到的和学到的，给全省各地农民作了数十次访苏见闻的介绍。这对扭转农民认为社会主义是归大堆，吃大锅饭的错误认识，和树立进一步向苏联学习的正确思想，起了很大的作用。凡是听到报告的农民，都表示要好好生产，照着苏联农民的道路走。我们社里过去最不爱听宣传社会主义的老社员张喜魁也说：“这回俺可服气了。”
    伟大的苏联人民，在各方面所积累起来的先进的生产技术和生产经验，是我们学习的榜样，它们对于促进我国的社会主义工业化和农业集体化，将起巨大作用。就拿我们的农业生产合作社来说：我社去年开始试办时，在劳动力的组织、分工和劳动日的计算上曾产生很多问题。夏锄时，由于没有固定的劳动组织，劳动力支配不合适，共浪费了一百五十多个工。秋收中，由于劳动日计算不科学，部分社员在生产中有“避重就轻”的不良倾向。后来，我从苏联参观回来，带回了苏联集体农庄的生产定额及劳动分工等先进经验，经过全体社员反复讨论，确定从今年春耕起，开始实行按队常年包工、三级定额制的办法：把全社八十四名社员按技术高低和体格强弱分成三个生产队（一个水田队和两个旱田队），春耕时，又从两个旱田队中抽出六名劳动力组成技术小组，专门使用新农具。各队以固定的劳动力，包下固定的耕地面积，按时完成作业计划。另在农忙或有特殊情况时，由社的生产管理委员会按各队具体情况，临时统一拨工。其次，把全社一年中各种活计，按轻重、繁简、难易和所需要的技术等具体情况，规定出数量、质量和时间的要求，划分成三级活，每级的差额是二分（一级活每日十二分，二级十分，三级八分）。这样一来，全社劳动力使用得当，计算合理，不但常年贯彻了生产责任制，同时也加强了劳动力使用上的灵活性，保证了各种作物的按时耕作，并改变了过去的窝工、旷工和生产无人负责等浪费劳动力的现象，使全社劳动效率比以前提高了百分之三十五到四十左右。今年，社里用苏联先进经验交叉播种的小麦，虽然受了自然灾害，平均每垧还打了四千斤，比去年每垧增产了一千斤。秋庄稼本来长得很好，可是最后又受到了严重霜灾，估计要减产，但是社员们一点也没有泄气，很快就订出了增产节约计划，争取弥补庄稼歉收的损失。
    社员们都知道，我们农业生产合作社的成绩，是和中国共产党、人民政府的领导及苏联老大哥的帮助分不开的。生产队长梁乃堂说：“在苏联老大哥的帮助下，咱社从一九五○年就使用马拉农具种地，提高了耕作效率，多得了粮食。若不是老大哥帮助，咱们这辈子也扔不下弯把子犁。”大家一提起苏联集体农庄农民的幸福生活，就更加热爱苏联的集体农庄，向往着那样的集体农庄。我们常这样想：搞好农业生产合作社，这不眼看着就摸到社会主义的边了吗？想到这，大家便觉得更有奔头了。十八岁的年轻姑娘牛桂芝常说：“现在我要好好劳动，努力学习，将来当一个社会主义社会中的拖拉机手，向苏联的劳动英雄拖拉机队长安格林娜同志学习。”老社员牛德芳也说：“别看我今年五十六岁，一定要好好干，我还要过集体农庄的生活呢！”现在社员们都已住进亲手盖起的新房子，在新房子的门前，还准备修一条约有十八公尺宽、二百二十公尺长的养鱼池。社员们住上了新房子，可高兴极了。男女社员不绝地歌唱组织起来的优越性，歌唱着未来的幸福生活：“……我们有力量，我们有信心，分工合作，齐心努力，越干越有劲，朝着集体农庄，走向社会主义，大踏步，向前进。”（志强整理）
