Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 22nd: The American side, on the 21st, directed special agent elements to use force and threats to resist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the murder of prisoner of war Zhang Liutai in the American "hospital" in Dongchang-ri. The American side is so afraid of the investigation because witnesses from the Korean and Chinese side, Wang Xianzhang, Lian Hongjun, and Chang Zhongxin, have provided ironclad evidence regarding this murder case.

Wang Xianzhang told reporters that he had told the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the entire process before and after Zhang Liutai was killed.

Zhang Liutai entered Camp No. 44 on September 29th, and he slept on bed No. 41 in the Chinese patient tent in the internal medicine ward. On the same day, the special agent Wang Junsheng came over, took off Zhang Liutai's clothes, and saw that he had no tattoos, so he scolded him, pulled his ears, slapped his face, and shouted that he wanted to kill him. After a while, the special agent Deng Hongxun also came and asked him where he wanted to go. Zhang Liutai said, "Back to China." Deng Hongxun slapped him and said, "You're dreaming! Even if I beat you to death, I won't let you go back!" Another special agent, Yu Rongfu, also came up and slapped Zhang Liutai, saying, "You want to go back to the Communist Party? Impossible! In the past, I killed many Communists in the hospital, let alone you. Anyone who wants to go back to the Communist Party will be killed!" A guard captain surnamed Shou ordered guard member Guo An to monitor him. The one surnamed Shou said, "Don't let him run, if he runs, beat him to death, I'll take responsibility!" A squad leader, Zhao Kai, went up to scold him again and slapped him several times. Deng Hongxun ordered that Zhang Liutai not be given food.

Then Deng Hongxun, Yu Rongfu, Hu Kechang, and the guard captain Shou, a total of four special agents, held a meeting on bed No. 4. Deng Hongxun said: "This kid is a Communist, he wants to go back, we better starve him to death, and then report that he died of illness." The guard captain originally advocated killing him and burying him behind the toilet, but in the end, the special agents all agreed to do it according to Deng Hongxun's method.

By October 1st, Zhang Liutai had been hungry for two days. That morning, medical personnel from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission came to visit the hospital. Deng Hongxun ordered everyone to throw stones, and whoever didn't throw stones would be smashed to death. Indian soldiers entered the camp to maintain order, and the special agents forced the prisoners of war to beat the Indian soldiers.

As soon as the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian soldiers left, Wang Xianzhang personally heard the four special agents hold another meeting immediately, deciding to take the opportunity to kill Zhang Liutai and then say that he was beaten to death by the Indians. They also smeared red medicine on the heads and bodies of many prisoners of war, pretending to have been injured by the Indians. Then, Deng Hongxun issued the order to kill Zhang Liutai.

Guard squad leader Xu Lingui and guard member Xia Daming each took a wooden stick from a canvas bed and dragged Zhang Liutai from the bed to the corner of the tent. Xia Daming tied his hands behind his back, and Xu Lingui hit him on the head with the wooden stick. The first blow hit the top of his head, and the second blow hit his face. Zhang Liutai was knocked unconscious and fell to the ground. Then Xu Lingui and Xia Daming took turns beating him, a total of twenty or so blows. After the beating, Deng Hongxun came up and kicked Zhang Liutai in the stomach several times. Xu Lingui and Xia Daming dragged him back to the bed. Xu Lingui stuffed his mouth with a towel. The special agents kicked and stepped on him with leather shoes, brushed the soles of his feet with a brush, Xia Daming placed the stick under Zhang Liutai's neck, Xu Lingui placed the stick on his throat, and the two held one end each, strangling Zhang Liutai to death.

After Zhang Liutai died, Yu Rongfu immediately went to the doctor's room to call the Americans. After a while, an American lieutenant colonel, an American lieutenant, and two soldiers came. They examined the body, counted the number of "injured" people, and then carried the body onto an ambulance and transported it away.

Deng Hongxun said to everyone: "When you get there, you must say that the Indians beat him to death. Whoever leaks the secret will be killed!" He also ordered the drafting of seven "petitions" to Eisenhower, Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and others, protesting the Indian army "beating our patients to death." In the evening, Hu Kechang ordered the prisoners of war to put blood fingerprints on these "petitions." These petitions were taken away the next morning by "Teacher Ma," a Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek special agent.

On October 2nd, an Indian officer and the American lieutenant colonel mentioned above came to investigate. Deng Hongxun and others let the pre-prepared special agent Hu Kechang lie on a stretcher and carry him out to "testify." During the investigation, a Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek special agent surnamed Wei, who was posing as a hospital staff member, acted as the translator and proofread the records before letting Hu Kechang sign. After Hu Kechang came back, he said to everyone: "The Indians admitted it! We won this lawsuit!"

Chang Zhongxin, while testifying at the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, presented evidence that the "administrative personnel" of the American hospital and the Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek special agent "Teacher Ma" directed the killing. On October 2nd, Deng Hongxun, under the pretext of carrying food, found Ge Yunfei at Camp No. 42 (kitchen). Deng Hongxun said to Ge Yunfei: "We beat to death a bad egg yesterday who wanted to return to the Communist Party. 'Teacher Ma' previously instructed us to starve him to death. Yesterday, when the Polish and Czech representatives came, the Indians came in to maintain order, and we fought against the Indians. Afterwards, we beat him to death and put the responsibility on the Indians." Deng also said that they had written petitions to Eisenhower, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

Lian Hongjun, a returnee from the Korean People's Army, also provided evidence. He had personally seen the special agents beat Zhang Liutai, and later he personally saw them carry away Zhang Liutai's body.

    在中立国遣返委员会作证时
    我方证人揭露特务杀害张六泰的全部经过
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方二十一日指挥特务分子用武力威胁抵制了中立国遣返委员会对东场里美国“医院”中战俘张六泰被谋杀案的调查。美方这样害怕调查是因为朝中方面的证人王宪章、廉弘均、常中信已提供了关于这件谋杀案的铁的证据。
    王宪章对记者说，他已把张六泰被杀前后全部经过告诉了中立国遣返委员会。
    张六泰是九月二十九日进入第四十四号营场的，他睡在内科病房中国病员帐篷内第四十一号床上。当天，特务分子王俊生过来脱掉张六泰的衣服，看到他没有刺字，就骂他并且扯他的耳朵，打他的脸，嚷着要杀他；一会儿特务分子邓鸿勋也来了，问他想到那里去，张六泰说“回中国”。邓鸿勋打他一个耳光说：“你在做梦！打死你也不让你回去！”另外一个特务于荣福也上来打了张六泰一个耳光，他说：“你想回到共产党那里去吗？不可能！过去我在医院里杀了很多共产党，不要说你一个，谁想回共产党那里去就杀谁！”姓守的警备队长命令警备队员郭安监视着他，姓守的说：“不准他跑，要跑就把他打死，我负责！”一个班长赵凯又上去骂他，并且打了他几个耳光。邓鸿勋下令不准给张六泰吃饭。
    接着邓鸿勋、于荣福、胡克昌和警备队长守某等四个特务就在第四号病床上开会，邓鸿勋说：“这个小子是共产党，他想回去，我们最好把他饿死，然后报个病死算了。”警备队长原先主张把他杀掉埋在厕所后面，但是最后特务们都同意按邓鸿勋的办法做。
    到十月一日，张六泰已经饿了两天。那天早晨，中立国遣返委员会的医务人员到医院来参观，邓鸿勋命令大家都要扔石头，谁不扔就砸死谁。印度兵进营场来维持秩序，特务们就强迫战俘们打印度兵。
    中立国遣返委员会代表和印度兵一走，王宪章又亲自听见四个特务立刻又开了一次会，在会上决定乘机把张六泰杀死，然后就说是印度人打死的。他们还把许多战俘头上、身上抹上红药水，装成是被印度人打伤的样子。接着，邓鸿勋就下了杀死张六泰的命令。
    警备班长徐林贵和警备队员夏大明每人拿了一根帆布床上的木棒，把张六泰从床上拖到帐篷角落里去，夏大明把他双手反翦在背后，徐林贵用木棍劈头向他打去，第一下打中了头顶，第二下打中了脸，张六泰就被打昏，倒在地上。然后徐林贵、夏大明轮流打他，一共打了二十来下。打完了，邓鸿勋上来就对着张六泰的肚子踢了几脚。徐林贵和夏大明把他拖回到床上，徐林贵用一块毛巾塞住他的嘴。特务们用穿皮鞋的脚踢他、踏他，用刷子刷他的脚心，夏大明把棍子放在张六泰的颈下，徐林贵把棍子放在他的喉咙上面，两人各执一端，使劲把张六泰夹死了。
    张六泰死后，于荣福马上到医生的房间里给美国人打电话。一会儿来了一个美军中校、一个美军中尉和两个士兵。他们检查了尸体，清点了“受伤”的人数以后，把尸体搬上救护车运走。
    邓鸿勋对大家说：“到那里也得说是印度人打死的，谁泄漏了机密就把他杀掉！”他还下令起草七份“请愿书”，给艾森豪威尔、李承晚、蒋介石等人，抗议印度军队“打死我们病人”。晚上胡克昌就命令战俘们在这些“请愿书”上盖血手印。这些请愿书在第二天上午由台湾蒋匪特务“马老师”带走。
    十月二日，一个印度军官和上面所说的美国中校来调查。邓鸿勋等就让预先准备好的特务胡克昌躺在担架上抬出去“作证”，在调查时，由冒充医院工作人员的姓魏的台湾蒋匪特务担任翻译，并校对了记录，才让胡克昌签名。胡克昌回来以后，向大家说：“印度人承认了！这场人命官司我们打赢了！”
    常中信在中立国遣返委员会作证时，提出了美国在医院中的“行政人员”、台湾蒋匪特务“马老师”指使杀人的证据。十月二日，邓鸿勋借抬饭的名义，到四十二号营场（伙房）找到了葛云飞。邓鸿勋对葛云飞说：“我们昨天打死了一个想回共产党的坏蛋。‘马老师’以前指示我们把他饿死，昨天打波兰捷克代表的时候，印度人进来维持秩序，我们和印度人对打。以后我们就把他打死，把责任推到印度人身上。”邓还说他们已写了请愿书给艾森豪威尔、李承晚和蒋介石。
    朝鲜人民军归来人员廉弘均也提供了证据。他曾经亲眼看见特务们打张六泰，以后又亲眼看到他们把张六泰的尸体抬走。
