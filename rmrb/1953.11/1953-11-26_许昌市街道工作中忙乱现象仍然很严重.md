    The Chaotic Phenomenon in Street Work in Xuchang City Is Still Very Serious

    Letters from Zheng Kunshan and Zhang Xinzheng, Xuchang City People's Government, Henan Province: The chaotic phenomenon in street work in Xuchang City is still very serious. According to our incomplete statistics, from August 15th to September 14th, in just one month, the various departments of the Municipal Government convened as many as 31 meetings attended by street chiefs. Sometimes there were several meetings a day, and even two meetings at the same time. For example, on the morning of August 31st, the Health Department convened street chiefs and health directors to evaluate the health inspection situation. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Cultural Center held a street chief meeting to summarize current affairs propaganda work. The Finance Department held a street chief and clerk meeting to arrange public property deed tax work. Following so many meetings is a series of tasks. Some of these tasks are "to be completed within a time limit," and others require street chiefs to "take responsibility" and "pay attention." Each department emphasizes the importance of its own work, regardless of the actual difficulties at the lower levels. The street government has only three and a half cadres detached from production, and they are overwhelmed by various tasks. The street chief of South Street said, "Just going to the Municipal Government for meetings requires one person to handle it." Some street chiefs said, "Anyway, street work is complex and difficult to handle. Whoever grasps it tightly, we'll work for them."

    The reason for the many meetings and tasks in street work in Xuchang City is that the leadership of the Municipal People's Government has not taken effective measures to prevent the phenomenon of decentralism. Moreover, the various departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the need to integrate all work with production, so they each do their own thing, and the methods for promoting work still remain at the level of holding meetings. They also say verbally, "This does not contradict production," and "As long as it is carried out under the principle of not affecting production," but in practice, various tasks squeeze out production.

### 许昌市街道工作中忙乱现象仍然很严重

    许昌市街道工作中忙乱现象仍然很严重
    河南省许昌市人民政府郑崑山、张新正来信：许昌市街道工作中忙乱现象仍很严重。据我们不完全统计，自八月十五日至九月十四日一个月中，仅市政府各科局就召开有街长参加的会议达三十一次之多。有时一天几个会，甚至在同一时间内召开两个会议。如八月三十一日上午卫生科召集街长及卫生主任评议卫生检查情况，下午二时文化馆开街长会总结时事宣传工作，财政科开街长、文书会布置公产契税工作。随着这么多会议而来的就是一连串的任务。这些任务，有的是“限期完成”，有的要街长“负责”、“重视”。各部门都强调自己的工作重要，不顾下边的实际困难。街政府一共只有三个半脱离生产干部，他们被各种任务压得喘不过气来。南大街街长说：“光去市政府开会，就得一个人支应着。”有的街长说：“反正街道工作复杂难搞，谁抓得紧给谁干。”
    许昌市街道工作中会议多、任务多的原因，是市人民政府领导方面没有采取有效措施制止分散主义现象。而各部门对一切工作必须结合生产的认识不够，因而各搞一套，把推动工作的方法仍停留在开会上。他们口头上也说：“这与生产没矛盾”、“只要在不影响生产原则下进行”，但是实际做起来，各种工作就把生产挤掉了。
