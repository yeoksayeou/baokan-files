    Coordinating with Various Regions to Improve Material Supply During Grain Procurement
    Northeast Local Industrial Products Flow Steadily Through the Customs
    During the production increase and economy practice movement, the Shenyang Purchasing and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company has expanded the supply of industrial products to areas inside the customs (关内, Guānnèi, i.e., areas south of the Great Wall), in order to support the material needs of various regions for grain and cotton procurement.

    In mid-September, department store wholesale stations in various regions inside the customs had already placed large orders for industrial products from the Northeast. These included over 11,000 tons of paper, 230,000 cases of glass, and over 10,000 tons of sugar. These commodities were planned to be supplied to various regions inside the customs in the fourth quarter. This year, many regions inside the customs have had bumper harvests of rice, and with the state's adjustment of grain procurement prices, farmers' purchasing power has increased, and the rural market has rapidly expanded. This situation has led to a situation where industrial products in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places cannot meet demand. State-owned department stores and wholesale stations in Nanjing, Shangqiu, and Guihua have successively come to the Northeast to increase their purchases of industrial products. Based on this situation, the Shenyang Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station has successively sent sales promotion teams to North China, Central South China, and Northwest China to expand the supply of industrial products to areas inside the customs.

    By the beginning of November, these sales promotion teams had already signed contracts with state-owned department store wholesale stations in various regions for the supply of over 130 billion yuan worth of Northeast industrial products. This large batch of commodities not only included paper and glass, which had been sold in the market inside the customs in the past, but also added dozens of new types of products that were entering the customs for the first time in large quantities, such as soap, toothpaste, canned goods, blankets, and various knitwear. From the perspective of the supply areas, not only do agricultural and pastoral areas and small and medium-sized cities need Northeast industrial products, but even state-owned department stores in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have replenished some. Northeast specialty apple preserves and various canned fish and meat are very popular in the Shanghai and Tianjin markets. Orders from twenty large and medium-sized cities alone reached more than 380,000 cans.

    The large-scale entry of daily-use industrial products into the customs indicates that the production of state-owned light industry in the Northeast region has greatly developed in both quantity and quality. Half a year ago, many of the soaps and toothpastes sold in the Northeast region were famous brands produced in Shanghai. However, since the establishment of the Changbai toothpaste factory by a local state-owned industrial enterprise in Liaodong Province this year, it has gradually replaced the famous brands of Shanghai. Now, state-owned factories in the Northeast can produce three kinds of good toothpaste, and the Nanchang area alone has ordered 28,000 dozens. In the first quarter, the Handan wholesale station purchased a batch of high-grade soaps from a local state-owned factory in Shenyang, and in less than a month, they were all taken away by retail stores. Now, customers who come to the Handan State-owned Department Store to purchase goods often ask when there will be more good soaps from the Northeast. This time, the Handan wholesale station has ordered another batch of Northeast soap. In Lanzhou and Xi'an, they did not know what light industrial products the Northeast had in the past. After the business personnel of the local wholesale stations saw the samples brought by the sales promotion team, they said, "It turns out that state-owned factories in the Northeast produce so many good products, which provides the conditions to guarantee the daily consumer needs of the people in the Northwest." The Lanzhou Department Store Wholesale Station ordered blankets, autumn clothes, and shoes, etc., totaling more than 30 billion yuan.

    At present, light industrial products from the Northeast region are being transported to various regions inside the customs from the railway and the sea. In October, 270 train cars and 8,000 tons of materials by sea have already been shipped. At the beginning of November, sixteen or seventeen train cars of Northeast industrial products are transported to various regions inside the customs every day.

### 配合各地做好购粮中物资供应工作  东北地方工业品源源进关

    配合各地做好购粮中物资供应工作
    东北地方工业品源源进关
    中国百货公司沈阳采购供应站在增产节约运动中，扩大了对关内工业品的供应，以支持各地收购粮食和棉花的物资需要。
    在九月中，关内各地百货批发站就已经向东北订购了大批工业品。其中有一万一千多吨纸张，二十三万箱玻璃，以及万余吨砂糖等。这些商品都计划在第四季度中陆续供应关内各地。今年关内许多地区稻谷丰收，加之国家调整了粮食收购价格，农民的购买力提高，农村市场迅速扩大。这一情况，使得上海、天津等地的工业品供不应求，南京、商邱、归绥等地的国营百货公司、批发站，都先后到东北来增加工业品的进货。根据这一情况，沈阳百货采购供应站先后向华北、中南、西北各地派出推销小组，扩大对关内的工业品供应。
    十一月初，这些推销小组就已经和各地的国营百货批发站签订了一千三百多亿元的东北工业品供应合同，这一大批商品中不仅包括了过去已经在关内市场上销售过的纸张、玻璃，而且增添了数十种第一次进关的大批香皂、牙膏、罐头、毛毯及各种针织品；从供应的地区上看，不仅是农牧区和中小城市需要东北工业品，连上海和天津等大城市的国营百货公司也补进了一些。东北特产的苹果罐头和鱼肉等各种罐头，在上海、天津市场很受欢迎。二十个大中城市的订货量即达三十八万多听。
    大批日用工业品的进关，说明东北区内国营轻工业生产在数量和质量上都有很大的发展。半年前东北区内销售的香皂、牙膏，其中有很多是上海产的名牌货。但从今年辽东省地方国营工业设厂生产长白牙膏之后，就逐渐代替了上海的名牌货。现在东北地方国营工厂已经能生产三种好牙膏，仅南昌一个地区就订了两万八千打。邯郸批发站前一季度曾从沈阳地方国营工厂进了一批高级香皂，不到一个月的工夫，就被零售商店全部要去了。现在，到邯郸市国营百货商店里来进货的顾客们，还常常询问甚么时候还有东北好香皂来。这次，邯郸批发站又订购了一批东北香皂。在兰州和西安，过去他们不知道东北有些什么轻工业产品；当地批发站的业务人员看到了推销小组携带去的样品之后说：“原来东北国营工厂出产这么多的好货，这就有条件保证西北人民的日用消费需要了。”兰州百货批发站订购的毛毯、秋衣和鞋子等商品，共达三十多亿元。
    目前，东北区的轻工业产品正从铁路和海上源源运往关内各地。十月份已经运出的已有二百七十个车皮，和海运的八千吨物资。十一月初每天都有十六、七个车皮的东北工业品运达关内各地。
