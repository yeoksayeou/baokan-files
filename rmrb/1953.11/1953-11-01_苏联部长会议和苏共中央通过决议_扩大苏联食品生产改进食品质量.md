Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th TASS: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have passed a resolution on "Expanding Food Production and Improving Food Quality." The resolution states: In recent years, the Soviet Union has greatly increased the production of food. With the output of 1940 as 100, the increase in the output of major foods by enterprises under the USSR Ministry of Food Industry in 1953 is as follows:

	Meat - 162; Fish (catch) - 172; Sausages - 158; Animal fats - over 200; Cheese - over 200; Vegetable oil - 153; Margarine - over 300; Sugar - 168; Canned food - over 250; Confectionery - 172; Macaroni products - over 220; Rice - 124; Beer - 152; Wine - 184.

	Food production in 1953 will increase by 41 percent compared to 1950. However, the output of meat, animal fats, dairy products, confectionery and some other major foods in the first half of 1953 did not increase much compared to the first half of 1952, and the fish catch even decreased, so these foods cannot meet the growing needs of the residents.

	The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU believe that the current total amount of food production and its growth rate cannot guarantee the completion of the task of rapidly improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people.

	The achievements in the development of heavy industry and agriculture, as well as further measures to improve agriculture, guarantee the establishment of a solid raw material base to greatly increase food production.

	The resolution states that the urgent task now is to rapidly increase the supply of meat and meat products, fish and fish products, oils, sugar, confectionery, canned food and other foods in the next two to three years.

	The resolution points out that the quality of food has improved in recent years, and the variety of food has also greatly increased. However, some food industry enterprises are still producing products that do not meet standards or customer requirements.

	In order to fundamentally change the expansion of food production, improve food quality and increase varieties, the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU stipulated:

	To rapidly increase food production in 1954-1956, improve quality, increase varieties, improve packaging, and complete the food production plan for 1955 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan as early as possible. The resolution stipulates that the output of various major foods should be greatly increased. It was decided to substantially increase the production of meat, sausages, canned meat and other meat products. Among them, meat production in 1954 should reach 2.18 million tons, which is 74 percent more than in 1950. Meat production in 1955 will be 2.55 million tons, and in 1956 it will be 3 million tons, which is 2.4 times that of 1950. Sausage production in 1954 should reach 710,000 tons, 850,000 tons in 1955, and 1 million tons in 1956, which is 2.2 times that of 1950. From 1954 to 1956, 144 meat food manufacturing enterprises will be put into operation. The output of fish and seafood will also be greatly increased. The output of fish and seafood in 1954 will be 27.15 million quintals, 31.9 million quintals in 1955, and approximately 36 million quintals in 1956, which is 2.1 times that of 1950. The production of refrigerated fish, salted herring, smoked or dried fish, black caviar and red caviar should also be increased. It is planned to produce 520 million cans of canned food in 1954 and 600 million cans in 1955, which is three times that of 1950. The resolution stipulates that the number of fishing vessels in fishing grounds should be greatly increased, canning factories and cold storage warehouses should be built, and fish farming should be carried out on a large scale in an industrial manner. Thirty-nine fishing grounds, fish egg breeding grounds and fish farms will be built on the Volga River, Kura River, Don River, Dnieper River, Amur River and other rivers.

	The resolution also stipulated the tasks of enterprises under the Ministry of Food Industry in producing animal fats, cheese, canned milk and other dairy products. The production of animal fats in 1954 and 1955 will be 476,000 tons and 560,000 tons respectively, and approximately 650,000 tons in 1956, which is twice the output in 1950. The output of cheese in the three years will be 97,000 tons, 135,000 tons, and 160,000 tons respectively, that is, the output in 1956 will increase to 3.3 times that of 1950. The resolution stipulates that 720 oil refineries, cheese manufacturing plants and preliminary milk processing plants, 100 municipal milk plants, 16 canned milk factories, and 80 warehouses for butter, cheese and other dairy products with cold storage rooms will be built in the next three years. In addition, it is also planned to greatly expand the production of vegetable oil and margarine. The output of vegetable oil in 1956 should be increased to 1.65 million tons, which is 2.1 times that of 1950. It is stipulated that the output of margarine should be increased by 2.7 times in these years, and should reach 510,000 tons in 1956. In addition to expanding existing enterprises, 12 new margarine manufacturing plants will also be built.

	Huge plans have also been formulated in the sugar industry. From 1954 to 1956, 25 sugar manufacturing plants, as well as 9 cube sugar manufacturing plants and workshops, will be opened, first in the western states of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. The output of granulated sugar in 1954 should be 4.3 million tons, 4.8 million tons in 1955, and nearly 5.3 million tons in 1956, which is 2.1 times the output in 1950. The output of cube sugar should be increased by 2.6 times. The output of cube sugar in 1956 should reach 1.8 million tons. The output of confectionery in 1954 should reach 1,579,000 tons, 1,825,000 tons in 1955, while it was 994,000 tons in 1950. It was decided to greatly increase the production capacity of canning enterprises by building new factories and renovating and expanding existing factories. The resolution also stipulates that the production of Soviet tea should be expanded and the productivity of tea manufacturing enterprises should be improved.

	In view of the fact that in recent years, the demand for high-quality bread, especially bread made from high-quality wheat flour (block bread, small bread, sweet bread, rusks, bagels), has been increasing, while the need for ordinary bread has been decreasing, the resolution decided to increase the production of rye flour, wheat flour and high-quality flour bread, especially improved block bread. The production of macaroni products should also be increased. 872,000 tons of macaroni products should be produced in 1954, and 1,030,000 tons in 1955, which is 2.3 times that of 1950. The resolution stipulates the construction of 372 bread factories and mechanized bakeries. It is planned to start construction of 25 flour combined factories and 11 factories and workshops for producing rice in 1955.

	One part of the resolution talked about the production of canned vegetables, tomatoes and fruits. Enterprises under the USSR Ministry of Food Industry should produce 1.78 billion cans of this type of canned food in 1954, 2.045 billion cans in 1955, while 922.2 million cans were produced in 1950. In 1956, the production of various canned foods (meat, fish, milk, vegetables, tomatoes, fruit canned foods) will reach 4.15 billion cans, which is an increase of 2.9 times that of 1950. It is planned to greatly increase the production of beer, fruit juice and spirits. The production of wine will increase to 30.37 million decaliters in 1954 and 34.48 million decaliters in 1955, which is an increase of 2.4 times that of 1950. Among them, the production of champagne will be 18 million bottles in 1954 and 20 million bottles in 1955. The production of brandy should be increased by 3.7 times that of 1950. Wine factories will be built in Moscow, Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk, Chelyabinsk and several other cities.

	The resolution also stipulated measures to further increase the production of cigarettes and spices.

	In order to improve the quality of food and improve the technology of food refrigeration and processing, it is stipulated that the volume of cold storage warehouses and the capacity of refrigeration equipment should be greatly increased.

	The final part of the resolution talks about guaranteeing the supply of material and technical equipment to the food industry and investment in the food industry. The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU believe that it is necessary to greatly increase the production of highly productive machines and automatic machines to ensure the rapid mechanization and automation of the food production process.

	The resolution tasked the Ministry of Machine Building Industry to produce machine equipment worth 530 million rubles for the USSR Ministry of Food Industry in 1954, and 800 million rubles in 1955. By the beginning of 1956, the production capacity of food machine manufacturing plants should reach the ability to produce machines worth a total of 1.1 billion rubles for the USSR Ministry of Food Industry.

	In order to guarantee the USSR Ministry of Food Industry's ability to increase food production, it is stipulated that the total investment in this area in 1954 will be 8.5 billion rubles, while the investment in this area in 1953 was 4.8 billion rubles.

	The resolution concludes: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU believe that ensuring the rapid rise of food production is one of the most important tasks of Soviet, Party and trade union organizations at all levels, and tasked the leaders of various ministries and competent authorities, the chairmen of the Councils of Ministers of various Union Republics and the secretaries of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of various Union Republics, the chairmen of the executive committees of the Soviet of various border regions and states, and the secretaries of the Party committees of various border regions and states, to do their best to help food industry enterprises complete the task of greatly increasing the supply of food to residents and producing abundant food in our country, and to formulate specific measures in the draft economic plans for 1954, 1955, and 1956 to ensure the unconditional realization of this resolution.

	The responsibility of all staff of food industry enterprises and institutions is to eliminate the existing shortcomings in industrial work, concentrate their efforts to complete and over fulfill the tasks stipulated in this resolution: greatly increase the production of food, improve product quality, produce exquisite products, so as to guarantee the production of abundant and high-quality food for the whole country in the near future.

    苏联部长会议和苏共中央通过决议
    扩大苏联食品生产改进食品质量
   【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会通过了关于“扩大食品生产和改进食品质量”的决议。决议写道：苏联近几年来已大大提高了食品的产量。以一九四○年的产量为一百，苏联食品工业部所属各企业一九五三年主要食品的产量增加情况如下：
    肉类——一六二；鱼类（捕鱼量）——一七二；腊肠类——一五八；动物油——二百以上；乳酪——二百以上；植物油——一五三；人造牛油——三百以上；糖——一六八；罐头——二五○以上；糖果——一七二；通心粉制品——二二○以上；米粮——一二四；啤酒——一五二；葡萄酒——一八四。
    一九五三年的食品产量将比一九五○年增加百分之四十一。可是，一九五三年上半年肉类、动物油、乳类制品、糖果和其他一些最主要的食品的产量比起一九五二年上半年的产量来，增加得并不多，而捕鱼量甚至缩减了一些，因而这类食品就不能满足居民日渐增长的需要。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会认为：目前食品生产的总量及其增长速度，不能保证完成较快地提高苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平这项任务。
    重工业和农业发展的成就，以及进一步提高农业的措施，都保证了建立牢固的原料基础以大力增加食品产量。
    决议写道，现在迫切的任务是，在最近两三年中要迅速提高肉类和肉制品、鱼类和鱼制品、油类、糖、糖果、罐头和其他食品的供应量。
    决议指出：最近几年食品的质量提高了，食品的种类也大大增加了。不过有些食品工业企业还在出产质量不合标准或不合顾客要求的产品。
    为了在扩大食品生产、提高食品的质量和增加种类方面进行根本改变，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会规定：
    在一九五四—一九五六年急速增加食品产量，提高质量、增加种类、改进分装和包装工作，尽量提前完成五年计划中规定的一九五五年度食品生产计划。决议规定要大大提高各种最主要食品的产量。决定大量增加肉类、腊肠类、肉类罐头和其他肉产品的产量。其中一九五四年的肉类生产要达到二百一十八万吨，即比一九五○年多百分之七十四。一九五五年肉类生产为二百五十五万吨，一九五六年为三百万吨，即为一九五○年的二点四倍。一九五四年腊肠类的生产要达到七十一万吨，一九五五年要达到八十五万吨，一九五六年要达到一百万吨，即为一九五○年的二点二倍。在一九五四—一九五六年，将有一百四十四个肉类食品制造企业开工。鱼类和海味的产量也将大大增加。一九五四年鱼类和海味的产量将为二千七百一十五万公担，一九五五年为三千一百九十万公担，一九五六年约为三千六百万公担，即为一九五○年的二点一倍。冷藏鱼类、咸鲱鱼、熏制或干制鱼类、黑鱼子和红鱼子的生产也要增加。计划在一九五四年生产五亿二千万听罐头，一九五五年生产六亿听罐头，即为一九五○年的三倍。决议规定要大量增加渔场捕鱼船，建造罐头工厂和冷藏库，并计划大规模地以工业方式从事鱼类养育工作。在伏尔加河、库拉河、顿河、第聂伯河、阿姆河以及其他河上将建造三十九个渔场、鱼卵培育场和养鱼场。
    决议也规定了食品工业部所属各企业在生产动物油、乳酪、乳类罐头和其他乳类产品方面的任务。一九五四年和一九五五年的动物油生产分别为四十七万六千吨和五十六万吨，一九五六年约为六十五万吨，即为一九五○年产量的二倍。乳酪在三年中的产量分别为九万七千吨，十三万五千吨，十六万吨，即一九五六年的产量增为一九五○年的三点三倍。决议规定在今后三年中要建造七百二十座炼油工厂、乳酪制造厂和牛奶初步加工工厂，一百座市营牛奶厂，十六座乳类罐头工厂，八十座设有冷藏室的牛油、乳酪和其他乳类产品仓库。此外还计划大量扩大植物油和人造牛油的生产。一九五六年的植物油产量应提高到一百六十五万吨，即为一九五○年的二点一倍。规定人造牛油的产量在这几年中增加为二点七倍，在一九五六年应达到五十一万吨。除扩大现有的企业外，还要建造十二个新的人造牛油制造厂。
    在制糖工业方面也制订了巨大的计划。在一九五四—一九五六年，首先在乌克兰西部各州和摩尔达维亚共和国中，开办二十五座沙糖制造厂，以及九座块糖制造厂和车间。一九五四年的沙糖产量应为四百三十万吨，一九五五年为四百八十万吨，一九五六年将近五百三十万吨，即为一九五○年产量的二点一倍。块糖的产量要增加为二点六倍。一九五六年的块糖产量应达到一百八十万吨。糖果的产量在一九五四年应达到一百五十七万九千吨，一九五五年达到一百八十二万五千吨，而一九五○年则为九十九万四千吨。决定用建造新工厂以及改建和扩充现有工厂的办法来大量提高罐头企业的生产能力。决议还规定扩大苏联茶的生产，并提高制茶企业的生产力。
    鉴于近几年来，居民对优等面包品、特别是优等小麦粉制造的面包品（块状面包、小面包、甜面包、面包干、面包圈）的需求量不断增加，而对普通面包的需要不断下降，决议决定增加稞麦粉、小麦粉和优等面粉的面包、特别是改良的块状面包的生产。通心粉制品的生产也要提高。一九五四年应生产通心粉制品八十七万二千吨，一九五五年生产一百零三万吨，即为一九五○年的二点三倍。决议规定建设三百七十二个面包工厂和机械化面包房。计划在一九五五年开始建设二十五个面粉联合工厂和十一个生产米粮的工厂和车间。
    决议有一部分谈到蔬菜、番茄和水果罐头的生产。苏联食品工业部的企业应于一九五四年生产该类罐头十七亿八千万听，一九五五年二十亿四千五百万听，而一九五○年所生产的是九亿二千二百万听。一九五六年，各种罐头（肉类、鱼类、乳类、蔬菜、番茄、水果罐头）的生产将达四十一亿五千万听，即增加为一九五○年的二点九倍。计划大大增加啤酒、果子汁和烧酒的生产。葡萄酒的生产在一九五四年增加到三千零三十七万公斗，一九五五年三千四百四十八万公斗，即增加为一九五○年的二点四倍。其中香槟酒的生产一九五四年为一千八百万瓶，一九五五年二千万瓶。白兰地酒的生产要增加为一九五○年的三点七倍。将在莫斯科、列宁格勒、新西伯利亚城、伯力、车里雅宾斯克和其他若干城市建设葡萄酒工厂。
    决议还规定了进一步增加香烟和香料的生产的措施。
    为了提高食品的质量，改进食品冷藏加工的技术，规定大大增加冷藏库的容积和冷藏设备的能力。
    决议最后部分谈到保证食品工业物质和技术设备供应和食品工业投资的问题。苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会认为必须大大增加生产率很高的机器和自动机器的生产，以保证食品生产过程的尽速机械化和自动化。
    决议责成机器制造工业部一九五四年为苏联食品工业部生产价值五亿三千万卢布的机器设备，一九五五年八亿卢布，到一九五六年初，食品机器制造工厂的生产能力要达到能为苏联食品工业部生产总值十一亿卢布的机器。
    为了保证苏联食品工业部增加食品生产能力，规定一九五四年在这方面的投资总额为八十五亿卢布，而一九五三年在这方面的投资为四十八亿卢布。
    决议最后说：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会认为，保证食品生产的急速高涨是各级苏维埃、党和工会机构的最重要任务之一，责成各部、各主管机关领导者、各加盟共和国部长会议主席和各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会书记、各边疆区和州苏维埃执行委员会主席以及各边疆区和州党委会书记，尽力帮助食品工业企业完成摆在工业面前的大大提高对居民食品的供应并在我国生产丰足的食品这一任务，并在一九五四、一九五五、一九五六年的经济计划草案中拟订具体措施，保证无条件地实现本决议。
    食品工业各企业和机构的全体工作人员的责任就是要消灭工业工作中的现存缺点，集中力量来完成并超额完成本决议所规定的任务：大大增加食品的生产，改善产品质量，出产精致的产品，从而在最近几年内为全国保证生产丰足的、质量很高的食品。
