(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th) Our correspondent Wu Min reports: After engaging in conspiracies to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea, the U.S. Ambassador to India, Allen, held a press conference in New Delhi on the 4th, arrogantly pounding the table and declaring that the United States refused to extend the explanation period. Allen obviously knew that his statement was groundless, and therefore tried his best to deny the serious responsibility of the U.S. side for delaying the start of the explanation work and using special agents to obstruct the explanation work. However, in the face of the facts, Allen's sophistry was full of contradictions and incoherence, making the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work even more blatant.

To shirk the responsibility for the U.S. side's delay in constructing explanation facilities, which repeatedly postponed the start of the explanation work, Allen deliberately distorted the armistice agreement. He said: "The armistice agreement does not stipulate that the United Nations Command has the obligation to build explanation tents. Therefore, the question of extending the explanation period because the tents were built too slowly does not exist." However, Article 19 of the armistice agreement, "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," clearly stipulates that the U.S. side is responsible for providing logistical support to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, including the construction of explanation tents. Article 19 stipulates: "Each side shall be responsible for providing logistical support to the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stationed in its military control area; in the Demilitarized Zone, such support shall be provided by both sides on an equal basis."

A reporter questioned Allen: "Does the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have the right to interpret the armistice agreement? If so, has the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission agreed to the interpretation made by the United Nations Command on the tent issue?" Allen was dumbfounded and unable to answer, and had to evade directly answering the question with vague words. Everyone knows that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not only repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. side delayed the construction of explanation facilities, which prevented the explanation work from starting on time; but also determined as early as September 25 the principle that if the explanation work is delayed, the explanation period should be extended, and has twice requested the U.S. side to agree to this principle. The statement issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 2 also specifically applied this principle.

Liars always think that others are very forgetful, and Allen is no exception in this regard. He tried to conceal the delaying tactics played by the U.S. side in the construction of explanation facilities, and shamelessly lied: "The United Nations Command troops worked day and night to complete this task." However, everyone will not forget that the thirty-two explanation tents, which could have been completed within four days, were delayed by the U.S. side for several weeks. Only when they had exhausted their tricks and made enough of a spectacle, and could no longer stand in front of world opinion, did the U.S. side have to complete the tents, which they claimed would take four weeks to build, overnight.

Under the questioning of the reporters, Allen admitted that there were special agent leaders in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial camps, and admitted that these special agent leaders controlled the prisoners of war. Allen also admitted that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission arrested the main special agent in Camp No. 28 who murdered prisoners of war, many prisoners of war rushed out of the camp demanding repatriation. Allen was obviously afraid that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission isolated the special agents mixed among the prisoners of war, the prisoners of war would demand repatriation. He openly threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, saying that if the special agents were isolated, they "must be careful of the possibility of collective escape of prisoners of war."

A reporter gave Allen another difficult question, asking him if the special agents in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial camps used radio stations and other equipment to contact the United Nations Command and the Syngman Rhee gang. Allen was cornered and unable to argue, and had to vaguely admit: "It is not very feasible and almost impossible to prohibit prisoners of war from communicating with each other." But he wanted to resort to rogue tactics, insisting that the responsibility for the special agents using radio stations and other equipment to receive instructions from the U.S. side to sabotage the explanation work should be borne by the Indian custodial troops. He argued that these special agents posing as prisoners of war "are under the custody of the Indian army. These are children taken care of by you." However, everyone knows that it was the U.S. side, not the Indian custodial troops, who handed over the radio stations and other equipment to the special agents to bring into the custodial camps. Moreover, after the Indian custodial troops confiscated two radios from the special agents, the U.S. side even claimed that they would lodge a protest, thereby threatening the Indian custodial troops not to take necessary measures against the illegal activities of the special agents. Obviously, the U.S. side should bear full responsibility for the sabotage activities of the special agents.

Allen knew that lying,耍赖 (shua lai - acting shamelessly), distorting, and sophistry could not turn his unreasonableness into reasonableness, so he resorted to threats. He threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, saying: "Within the prescribed period for explanation work, the Demilitarized Zone will not be attacked from the South." The implication is that if the explanation period is extended, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops will be subjected to military attacks by the Syngman Rhee gang. This is obviously using military threats to put pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    艾伦在新德里大放厥词反对顺延解释期限
   【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美国驻印度大使艾伦在朝鲜进行阻挠战俘遣返的阴谋活动以后，四日在新德里举行记者招待会，蛮横无理地拍着桌子宣称美国拒绝延长解释期限。艾伦显然知道自己的这种说法是毫无理由的，因此竭力企图抵赖美方拖延解释工作的开始和利用特务阻挠解释工作的严重责任。但是，在事实面前，艾伦的狡赖矛盾百出，语无伦次，使得美方破坏解释工作的阴谋更加彰明昭著。
    艾伦为了推卸美方拖延修建解释场所，以致解释工作的开始一再延期的责任，故意曲解停战协定。他说：“停战协定并未规定联合国军有建造解释帐篷的义务。因此，关于因为帐篷造得太慢而应该把解释工作的期限顺延的问题是不存在的。”但是，停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十九款明明白白规定：美方有责任对中立国遣返委员会提供包括修建解释帐篷在内的后勤支援。第十九款规定：“各方负责对驻在其军事控制地区内的中立国遣返委员会人员提供后勤支援；在非军事区内，此等支援由双方在平等基础上提供。”
    一个记者质问艾伦道：“停战协定的解释权是不是属于中立国遣返委员会，如果是，那么中立国遣返委员会是否同意联合国军司令部对帐幕问题所作的解释？”艾伦目瞪舌结，回答不出，只好支吾其词，逃避直接回答这个问题。大家知道，中立国遣返委员会不仅已经一再明确指出美方拖延修建解释场所，以致解释工作不能按时开始；而且早已在九月二十五日确定了解释工作推迟开始则解释期限应予顺延的原则，并曾两度要求美方同意这个原则。中立国遣返委员会十月二日发表的声明中也具体应用了这个原则。
    说谎者总是以为别人都是十分健忘的，艾伦在这方面并不例外。他企图掩饰美方在修建解释场所上所玩弄的拖延手段，毫不知耻地撒谎说：“联合国军部队昼夜不断地工作而完成了这项工作。”但是，大家都不会忘记：本来在四天之内就完全可能修建完成的三十二个解释帐篷，美方却拖了好几个星期，直到花样玩尽，丑态出足，在世界舆论面前再也站不住脚时，美方才不得不在一夜之间把他们硬说要四个星期才能修好的帐篷修建完成。
    在记者们的质问之下，艾伦承认中立国看管营场里有特务头子，并且承认这些特务头子控制着战俘。艾伦还承认中立国遣返委员会逮捕第二十八号营场内谋杀战俘的主要特务分子以后，有不少战俘冲出营场要求遣返。艾伦显然害怕中立国遣返委员会把混在战俘中间的特务分子隔离看管以后，战俘就会要求遣返，他公然恫吓中立国遣返委员会说：如果将特务分子隔离看管，就“必须当心战俘集体逃跑的可能”。
    一个记者又给艾伦出了一道难题，责问他中立国看管营场中的特务分子使用无线电台和其他设备与联合国军司令部和李承晚匪帮进行联络。艾伦被问得走头无路，无法狡辩，只得含糊其词地承认：“禁止战俘彼此之间通消息是不大行得通而且几乎是不可能的”。但是他又要出无赖手段，硬说特务分子使用无线电台和其他设备领受美方破坏解释工作的指示，应该由印度看管部队负责。他强词夺理地说：这些冒充战俘的特务分子“是在印度军队的看管下的。这是由你们照顾的孩子”。但是，谁都知道，把无线电台及其他设备交给特务带进看管营场去的是美方而不是印度看管部队。而且，在印度看管部队没收了特务分子的两架收音机以后，美方还曾经声称要提出抗议，借此恫吓印度看管部队不得对特务分子的这种非法行为采取必要的措施。显然，美方对特务分子的破坏行动应负完全责任。
    艾伦知道，撒谎耍赖，歪曲狡辩，都不能使他的无理变成有理，因此他拿出了威胁的手段来。他恫吓中立国遣返委员会说：“在规定的解释工作限期内，非军事区是不会受到来自南边的进攻的”。言外之意，就是：如果解释工作的期限延长，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队就要受到李承晚匪帮的军事进攻。这显然是用军事威胁对中立国遣返委员会施加压力。
