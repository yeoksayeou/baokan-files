The Central Ministry of Foreign Trade Inspection of Capital Construction Work
Discovers Many Projects Blindly Built, Causing Great Waste

    The Central Ministry of Foreign Trade recently convened a capital construction meeting to inspect the capital construction situation of units under its jurisdiction.

    The Central Ministry of Foreign Trade system has serious shortcomings in its capital construction work. First, there is great blindness in the preparation and approval of capital construction plans. For example, the Chongqing Tea Factory is far from the raw material production areas, the nearest being 300 *li* away, and the furthest being 800 or 900 *li*. The factory can only purchase 1,000 *dan* of tea per year, but it built a factory with an annual production capacity of 8,000 *dan* of tea. The Sanjie Tea Factory in Zhejiang Province is only 60 *li* away from the two tea factories in Shaoxing. If the Sanjie Tea Factory had not been built, the two tea factories in Shaoxing could have solved the local tea processing problem. At the same time, the Sanjie Tea Factory is built on a mountaintop, and many temporary tea workers have to travel 20 *li* to and from the factory every day, and it is also very inconvenient for the workers to drink water. The Yueyang Tea Factory in Hunan spent more than 600 million yuan to build a warehouse, but the area is not a major tea-producing area, so there is nothing to put in the warehouse after it was built. The Shenyang Food Processing Factory started construction in 1952, but it is still missing 85 design drawings for civil engineering and machinery. Recently, it was also discovered that the factory site was not chosen appropriately, and it is planned to move it to another location.

    Secondly, the specifications and equipment of the buildings do not proceed from actual needs, blindly pursuing "modernization," "mechanization," and "looking the part," resulting in serious extravagance and waste. The Hangzhou No. 4 Tea Factory occupies 200 *mu* of land, and most of the buildings are steel-concrete, with an investment of nearly 70 billion yuan. The factory cadres do not understand that the national construction is to "concentrate the main forces to develop heavy industry and establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization." Instead, they mistakenly believe that they are "laying a solid foundation for the industrialization of the Chinese tea industry, thereby accelerating the journey to socialism." The Nanjing Chicken and Duck Processing Factory built several "modern" duck houses, with swimming pools in the front and playgrounds in the back. The foundations, walls, lighting, and ventilation equipment inside are very elaborate. Some people call it "duck villas." A small bridge was built in the Jiangsu Xin'gang pigsty, which is more beautiful than the bridges in parks. A tea factory in a mountainous area of Anhui bought motors and diesel engines, and also wanted to buy shapers, milling machines, tool beds... but they are rarely used in practice.

    In addition, many comrades, when submitting capital construction plans, adopt the attitude of "generous estimates," "asking for money first," and "rather let the superiors approve less, never report less themselves," asking the central government for money every month and depositing it in the bank every month. This has resulted in a large accumulation of capital construction funds. According to statistics, the capital construction funds accumulated in various banks by the Ministry of Foreign Trade in the first half of this year accounted for about 50% of the total amount allocated. The Shanghai Food Export Company had the most accumulated funds, accounting for 80%; the Qingdao Land Transportation Company accumulated 80%; and the Shandong Silk Company accumulated 75%. The companies in the Southwest region accumulated about 70% in total.

    The root cause of this blind and rash advance ideology is, first of all, that the leadership has not thoroughly implemented the guidelines and policies for capital construction, leaving the lower-level cadres "without a clue." Ordinary cadres only know that we are now carrying out planned economic construction, but they do not know that the focus of this planned construction is heavy industry, and they do not even know that the basic construction task of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is processing plants first, and warehouses second. Therefore, when proposing plans, they often deviate from the general principles and emphasize the "work needs" of their own units. Some units even said this when applying for plan approval: "If it is not approved, who will be responsible for affecting import and export trade in the future!" Secondly, the period for preparing the plan is too urgent, and there is not enough time for investigation and research. A comrade in Inner Mongolia said that the situation of their plan preparation was: "The above insists on it, the below does not report, and the middle fabricates it." Naturally, it is difficult for the plans formulated in this way to be accurate. Therefore, the plan is approved and revised again and again, and construction is stopped, resulting in great waste. Again, some cadres do not proceed from actual needs and possibilities, blindly pursue "modernization," and are afraid that the specifications and forms of the buildings are not good enough; they are afraid that the construction speed is not fast enough; they are afraid that the money given by the superiors is not enough. Several unreasonable plans have been proposed under the guidance of this ideology.

    At this meeting, the idea of blind and rash advance was emphatically criticized, and it was decided that in the future, the policy and ideological education of capital construction cadres should be strengthened so that capital construction work can be carried out with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner.

    中央对外贸易部检查基本建设工作
    发现不少工程盲目兴建浪费很大
    中央对外贸易部最近召开了一次基本建设会议，检查了该部所属各单位的基本建设情况。
    中央对外贸易部系统在基本建设工作中存在严重的缺点，首先是编制与批准基本建设计划中有很大的盲目性，如重庆茶厂，离原料产地很远，最近的地方也有三百里，远的甚至达八、九百里。该厂一年只能收购一千担茶叶，但却建了个年产八千担茶叶的工厂。浙江省的三界茶厂离绍兴两个茶厂仅六十里，如三界茶厂不建，绍兴两个茶厂也可解决当地茶叶加工问题。同时该三界茶厂建在山顶上，许多临时茶工每天得奔走二十里路来厂工作，职工喝水也很不方便。湖南岳阳茶厂以六亿多元修了个仓库，但该地并非主要产茶区，所以建了仓库却找不到东西放。沈阳食品加工厂，一九五二年即已开工，但到现在还缺土木、机械等八十五张设计图表。最近又发现厂址选择得不合适，想迁到别处。
    其次在建筑物的规格和设备上，也不从现实需要出发，盲目地追求“现代化”、“机械化”、“像个样子”，形成严重的铺张浪费。杭州第四茶厂占用地基二百亩，大部建筑物均为钢骨水泥，投资近七百亿元。该厂干部不懂得国家建设是“集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础”，反而错误地认为他们是“为中国茶业工业化奠定巩固的基础，从而加速转入社会主义的行程”。南京鸡鸭加工厂盖了几所“现代化”的鸭舍，前有游泳池，后有游戏场，内部的地基、墙壁、光线、通风设备都很讲究，有人称它为“鸭别墅”。江苏新港猪仓内架了一座小桥，比公园里的桥还要好看。安徽山区一个茶厂买了马达、柴油机，还要买牛头刨、铣床、工具床……而实际使用的次数却很少。
    此外，不少同志提基本建设计划时，抱着“宽打窄用”，“要了钱再说”，“宁让上级少批，切勿自己少报”的态度，月月向中央要钱，月月到银行存款。造成基本建设资金大量积压。据统计对外贸易部本年上半年积压在各地银行的基本建设资金约占全部下拨款总额的百分之五十左右。积压资金最多的如：上海食品出口公司积压了百分之八十；青岛陆运公司积压了百分之八十；山东蚕丝公司积压了百分之七十五。西南区各公司共积压百分之七十左右。
    产生这种盲目冒进思想的根源，首先是因为领导方面对基本建设的方针政策贯彻得不够，使下层工作干部“心里无数”。一般干部只晓得我们现在是有计划的经济建设，而不知道这个有计划建设的重点是重工业，更不知道对外贸易部的基本建设任务是加工厂第一，仓库第二，因而提出计划时往往离开总的原则，强调自己单位的“工作需要”，有的单位在请批计划时甚至这样说：“如不批准，将来影响了进出口贸易，谁来负责！”其次是编制计划的期间太急迫，没有充分的调查研究时间。内蒙一个同志说他们编计划的情况是：“上面硬要，下边不报，中间滥造。”这样制订出来的计划自然很难准确。因此计划批了又改，改了又批，停工浪费很大。再次，是一部分干部不从实际需要与可能出发，盲目追求“现代化”，建筑的规格、形式唯恐不好；建筑速度唯恐不快；上级给的钱唯恐不多。若干不合理的计划都是在这种思想指导下提出的。
    在这次会议上，着重地批判了盲目冒进的思想，并决定今后要加强对基本建设干部的政策思想教育，使基本建设工作有重点有步骤地进行。
