Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 26th (Our Special Correspondent Wu Min reports): Mr. Petitpierre, Minister of the Swiss Political Department (i.e., Ministry of Foreign Affairs), delivered a speech in Uster, Switzerland, on November 22nd, vigorously defending the Swiss representative's acts of obstructing the explanation work in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Because the Korean and Chinese sides, as well as Poland and Czechoslovakia, exposed the Swiss representative's behavior, Petitpierre described the exposed facts as "groundless accusations" and stated that the Swiss delegation would never change its unjust attitude. Petitpierre boasted that Switzerland's "neutrality" was "unlimited" and "eternal," and said: "Our delegation is not only upholding judicial norms, but also defending the foundations of humanity."

Is the Swiss delegation really "upholding" "judicial norms" and the "foundations of humanity," and is it "unlimitedly" "neutral"?

Petitpierre himself said in his speech that if the procedures stipulated in the Armistice Agreement were applied reasonably and accurately, the difficulties that arose in the issue of prisoner of war repatriation could be resolved. However, why were the procedures stipulated in the Armistice Agreement not able to be applied reasonably and accurately? Petitpierre should be clear about this. Clause 3 of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the annex to the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that with regards to prisoners of war, "no force or threat of force shall be used to obstruct or compel their repatriation, and no violence or insults to their dignity or self-respect shall be permitted in any way or for any purpose (but subject to paragraph 7 below)." Paragraph 7 stipulates that "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 above, nothing herein shall be construed as detracting from the power of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its legitimate functions and responsibilities for the control of the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction." Paragraph 8 further stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall "afford to prisoners of war who desire repatriation every possible facility and opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated." The Swiss delegation is fully aware of all these provisions. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission later formulated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" based on the "Scope of Authority," specifically stipulating the procedures for carrying out the explanation work. The Swiss delegation directly participated in the drafting of these "Detailed Rules."

And now, isn't it this Swiss delegation that is refusing to reasonably and accurately implement the "Scope of Authority" and the "Detailed Rules"? The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has pointed out more than once in official documents that in the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of the Indian troops, the prisoners of war are actually under the violent control of the US-Syngman Rhee-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and have no free will whatsoever. The US-Syngman Rhee-Chiang Kai-shek special agents are using violence day and night to coerce the prisoners of war not to request repatriation. In order to request repatriation, the prisoners of war have to risk their lives to escape from the prisoner-of-war camps. The Swiss delegation is fully aware of these situations. All the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have been repatriated have all accused, in Panmunjom, of the terrifying means such as murder and persecution used by the Lee and Chiang special agents to prevent prisoners of war from requesting repatriation. They also pointed out on the spot Wei Jingmeng, a Kuomintang special agent posing as a "UN journalist." At the same time, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly made resolutions pointing out that the Lee and Chiang special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps have close ties with the US side. The Swiss delegation has witnessed and heard these appalling facts with its own eyes. The Swiss delegation also witnessed the US side secretly sending wireless equipment to the special agents and relaying orders from Syngman Rhee and Won Yong-duk. In these relayed orders, it was clearly instructed how the special agents should refuse and sabotage the explanation work, and how to control and kill prisoners of war who requested repatriation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly acknowledged that the current suspension of the explanation work is because the special agents have not allowed the organizations controlling the prisoners of war to be broken up, so they are not allowing prisoners of war who have not heard the explanation to come out and hear it. However, the "Detailed Rules" clearly stipulate: "Any act by prisoners of war that hinders explanation and interview work is prohibited." The Swiss delegation is also fully aware of this.

The Swiss delegation has seen all this, heard all this, and knew all this, but it opposes eliminating the special agents in the camp, opposes exercising the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's legitimate power over the special agents who use violence to threaten prisoners of war, allows the "Scope of Authority" and the "Detailed Rules" to be sabotaged, and allows the explanation work to be impossible. Is this an act of "upholding" "judicial norms" and the "foundations of humanity"? Is this a manifestation of "unlimited" "neutrality"? The Swiss delegation's opposition to exercising power over special agents who use violence to threaten prisoners of war is precisely to encourage the arrogance of the special agents, so that humanity and justice cannot be upheld, and judicial norms cannot be enforced. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the murder of prisoner of war Zhang Zilong in camp number 28 eloquently proves this truth. During the first investigation on November 1st, because the Indian custodial troops did not use their power against the special agents, the murderer of Zhang Zilong, although he had been identified by witnesses, could not be arrested. On November 2nd, the Indian custodial troops used limited power, which suppressed the arrogance of the special agents, arrested the murderer, and during the investigation process, more than 30 prisoners of war requested repatriation or acted as witnesses. If the Indian custodial troops, following the Swiss delegation's requirements, did not exercise their power against the special agents who used violence to threaten prisoners of war, how could the Zhang Zilong case be investigated? In the face of such facts, the Swiss delegation still opposes eliminating the special agents and opposes exercising power over the special agents who use violence to threaten prisoners of war. Is it that in Switzerland, terrorist organizations can arbitrarily control the people and massacre the people and be called "humanitarian"? Are murderers and their organizations in Switzerland allowed to be protected without being sanctioned?

Petitpierre, in his speech, accused the Korean and Chinese sides of "interfering" in the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by demanding that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission exercise its power over the special agents who sabotage the explanation work. Is the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to protect special agents to sabotage the explanation and sabotage the "Scope of Authority"? The demands put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides are actually decisions made by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself. Due to the obstruction of certain neutral countries, especially the Swiss delegation, these decisions have not been able to be implemented. The Korean and Chinese sides demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission implement these decisions in order to safeguard the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and ensure the progress of the explanation work, which is completely legitimate. The Korean and Chinese sides demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission take effective measures against the special agents, including the legitimate power to use force. In fact, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly decided that the Indian custodial troops should take coercive measures to the extent that the special agents cannot use force and terror to obstruct prisoners of war from hearing the explanation and receiving interviews. On October 16th, the Committee also unanimously passed a decision stipulating that the Indian custodial troops can use weapons in the event of attacks and collective escapes or attempted collective escapes by prisoners of war. However, it was precisely the Swiss delegation that later overturned these decisions and made them impossible to implement. The Korean and Chinese sides' demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission isolate the unexplained prisoners of war was made in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules." This article stipulates that prisoners of war who have been explained should be kept separate from prisoners of war who have not been explained. On November 6th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requested the Korean and Chinese sides not to start the explanation of new camps until the entire camp of all prisoners of war had been explained, and promised that under this condition, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was prepared to build a camp to isolate those prisoners of war who had been explained and unexplained. What kind of "interference" is it for the Korean and Chinese sides to demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission fulfill its promise?

Petitpierre is so intolerant of these legitimate demands of the Korean and Chinese sides, fearing that the realization of these demands will prevent the special agents from carrying out inhuman terror rule over the prisoners of war, so he hastily came out to accuse the Korean and Chinese sides of "interfering" in the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. But people remember that in early October, when the US side issued violent scolding and insults against the work and measures taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the "Scope of Authority," and when Dulles and the entire US propaganda machine launched vicious attacks and ridicule against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and India, world opinion was in an uproar, but Petitpierre remained silent, never speaking a word, never accusing the United States of interfering in the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The truth of Switzerland's so-called "unlimited" and "eternal" "neutrality" boasted by Petitpierre is actually like this!

### 瑞士政治部部长吹嘘瑞士的“中立”态度  决不能掩盖瑞士代表阻挠解释工作的行为

    瑞士政治部部长吹嘘瑞士的“中立”态度
    决不能掩盖瑞士代表阻挠解释工作的行为
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：瑞士政治部（即外交部）部长彼蒂彼爱于十一月二十二日在瑞士乌斯特发表演说，竭力为中立国遣返委员会中瑞士代表阻挠解释工作的行为进行辩护。由于朝中方面以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克揭露了瑞士代表的这种行为，彼蒂彼爱把被揭露的事实说成是“毫无理由的指责”，并且表示瑞士代表团决不改变它所采取的不公正的态度。彼蒂彼爱吹嘘瑞士的“中立”是“无限制的”、“永恒的”，并且说：“我们的代表团不但是在维护司法准则，而且在维护人道的基础。”
    瑞士代表团真的是在 “维护”着“司法准则”和“人道基础”，而且是“无限制”“中立”的吗？
    彼蒂彼爱自己在演说中说，如果停战协定中的确定的程序被合理地而且确切地运用，那末战俘遣返问题上出现的困难是可能解决的。但是，为什么停战协定中的确定的程序没有能够被合理地而且确切地运用呢？彼蒂彼爱是应该清楚的。朝鲜停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三款规定，对战俘“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，
  （但须参照下述第七款），对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”。第七款规定， “虽然有上述第三款的规定，本协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力”。第八款更规定，中立国遣返委员会应“使战俘所属国家有自由与便利”向战俘进行九十天的解释。这一切规定，瑞士代表团是完全知道的。中立国遣返委员会以后又根据“职权范围”，制订了“解释和访问工作细则”，具体规定了解释工作进行的程序。瑞士代表团是直接参与了这个“工作细则”的拟订过程的。
    而现在，拒绝合理而确切地使“职权范围”和
   “工作细则”付诸实施的，难道不正就是这个瑞士代表团吗？中立国遣返委员会已经不止一次地在正式文件中指出，在印度部队看管下的战俘营中，战俘实际上是受着美李蒋特务的暴力控制，没有任何自由意志可言。美李蒋特务日以继夜地用暴力胁迫着战俘不得要求遣返。战俘为了要求遣返，不得不冒着极大的生命危险逃出战俘营。这些情形，瑞士代表团是完全知道的。所有已经遣返归来的朝中被俘人员，都曾经在板门店控诉李、蒋特务用谋杀、迫害等恐怖手段不许战俘要求遣返。他们还曾经当场指出了冒充“联合国军记者”的国民党特务魏景蒙。同时，中立国遣返委员会曾经一再作出决议，指出战俘营中的李、蒋特务和美方有着密切联系。瑞士代表团是亲眼看到并且亲耳听到这些骇人听闻的事实的。瑞士代表团还亲眼看到了美方偷送给特务的无线电机和转达李承晚、元容德的命令。在这个转达的命令中，明明白白地指示特务如何拒绝和破坏解释工作，如何控制和杀害要求遣返的战俘。中立国遣返委员会曾经一再承认，目前解释工作之所以停顿，是因为特务不许他们控制战俘的组织被打散，所以不让未听过解释的战俘出来听解释。而“工作细则”明明规定：“禁止战俘任何阻碍解释与访问工作的行为。”瑞士代表团同样是完全知道的。
    瑞士代表团看到了这一切，听到了这一切，知道了这一切，却反对肃清营场里的特务，反对对使用暴力威胁战俘的特务行使中立国遣返委员会的合法权力，听任“职权范围”和“工作细则”遭到破坏，听任解释工作无从进行，这难道是“维护”“司法准则”和“人道基础”的行为？这难道是“无限制”“中立”的表现？瑞士代表团反对对使用暴力威胁战俘的特务行使权力，恰恰是要鼓励特务的凶焰，使人道与正义不得伸张，使司法准则无法执行。中立国遣返委员会调查第二十八号营场谋杀战俘张子龙案的经过，雄辩地证明了这个真理。在十一月一日第一次调查时，由于印度看管部队没有对特务使用权力，谋杀张子龙的凶手虽然已被证人指认，却仍然无法加以逮捕。十一月二日，印度看管部队使用了有限的权力，就镇压了特务的凶焰，逮捕了凶手，并且在调查过程中有三十余名战俘要求遣返或当证人。如果印度看管部队依着瑞士代表团的要求，不对使用暴力威胁战俘的特务行使其权力，张子龙案件如何能进行调查？在这样的事实面前，瑞士代表团还是反对肃清特务，反对对使用暴力威胁战俘的特务行使权力，难道在瑞士，匪类恐怖组织可以任意控制人民，屠杀人民而被称为“人道”的吗？在瑞士杀人犯和他的组织可以不受制裁而加以保护的吗？
    彼蒂彼爱在他的演说中指责说，朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会对破坏解释工作的特务行使权力，是“干涉”中立国遣返委员会的工作。难道中立国遣返委员会的工作就是保护特务来破坏解释、破坏“职权范围”的么？朝中方面所提出的要求，实际上都是中立国遣返委员会自己的决定。由于某些中立国，特别是瑞士代表团的阻挠，这些决定没有能够付诸实施。朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会执行这些决定，以维护“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，保证解释工作的进行，这是完全正当的。朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会对特务采取有效措施，包括使用武力的合法权力在内。事实上中立国遣返委员会早已一再决定，印度看管部队应采取强制手段，其程度以使得特务不能用武力和恐怖手段阻挠战俘听取解释和接受访问为限。委员会在十月十六日并且一致通过一项决定，规定印度看管部队在遭到袭击和战俘集体逃跑或企图集体逃跑的情况下，可以使用武器。而后来推翻这些决定，并且使这些决定不能实施的，恰恰是瑞士代表团。朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会隔离未经解释的战俘，是根据“工作细则”第二十款的规定提出的。这一款规定，经过解释的战俘应与未经解释的战俘分别看管，中立国遣返委员会在十一月六日要求朝中方面在对整个营场的全部战俘解释完毕以前，不开始对新的营场的解释，并答应在这个条件之下，中立国遣返委员会准备修建一个营场，以隔离那些已经解释和未经解释的战俘。朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会实践它的诺言，这究竟是什么“干涉”的行为？
    彼蒂彼爱对于朝中方面的这些正当要求是如此不能容忍，唯恐这些要求的实现将使特务分子不能对战俘实行惨无人道的恐怖统治，因此急忙出来指责朝中方面“干涉”中立国遣返委员会的工作。可是人们记得，在十月初，当美国方面对中立国遣返委员会遵照 “职权范围”进行的工作和措施发出横暴叫骂和侮辱的时候，当杜勒斯以及美国的全套宣传机器对中立国遣返委员会和印度进行恶毒攻击和嘲骂的时候，全世界的舆论都为之哗然，但是彼蒂彼爱却默不作声，从没有出来讲一句话，从没有指责美国干涉中立国遣返委员会的工作。彼蒂彼爱所吹嘘的瑞士的所谓 “无限制的”“永恒的”“中立”，其真相原来就是如此！
