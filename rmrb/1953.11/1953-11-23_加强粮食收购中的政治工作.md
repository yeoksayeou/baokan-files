    Strengthen Political Work in Grain Procurement

    Procuring grain from farmers with surplus grain nationwide at reasonable prices to ensure the grain supply for national factories, mines, urban residents, the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, rural households lacking grain, and disaster victims, to ensure the necessary national grain reserves, stabilize prices, eliminate speculation, restrict capitalist activities in rural areas, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance is an extremely important policy during the period of national economic construction. This is not only a major economic task but also a major political task.

    In the actual work of grain procurement, the enormous role of political work has been fully demonstrated. Recently, in many places, farmers who have heard the many major principles of the state's grain procurement have enthusiastically sold their grain to the state. For example, farmers in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, after listening to the speeches of district and township cadres, understood the great significance of state grain procurement for stabilizing prices, ensuring people's livelihoods, and carrying out construction, and recognized that the state's grain procurement prices were fair and reasonable. This reversed their "wait-and-see" mentality and they enthusiastically sold their grain. Shao Dongli, a farmer in Qingtang Township, told cadres: "In the past, I didn't know what the state did with the grain it procured; now I know it's for the country's industrialization and taking the socialist road. If you had told me this earlier, I would have sold my rice to the state sooner." He immediately sold four piculs of rice to the state. When wheat was marketed in Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, farmers with surplus grain were generally unwilling to sell it, some fearing future disasters, some waiting for prices to rise, and some fearing that selling grain would "reveal their wealth"; some even rushed to buy and hoard grain. The Ruicheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China used the propaganda network to carry out extensive propaganda activities targeting the ideological situation of the masses. The masses' thinking quickly changed, the phenomenon of rushing to buy grain stopped, and the wheat procurement work proceeded smoothly. In Chengnan Township, where the phenomenon of rushing to buy grain was most serious, the masses, after understanding the rationale, implemented collective wheat sales, selling more than 13,000 jin of wheat at once. Many places have exposed to farmers the unscrupulous activities of merchants hoarding grain, raising prices, and lowering prices, greatly increasing farmers' vigilance against unscrupulous merchants. After listening to the propaganda, the farmers of Santang Township, Hengnan County, Hunan Province, encountered unscrupulous merchants raising prices to buy grain and told them: "You want to hoard grain again, so you can sell it at a higher price in the future to exploit us. No matter how good the price is, we won't sell it to you!" Zhou Zongfa, a farmer from Houtun Township, Tenth District, Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, went to the supply and marketing cooperative to sell grain. He met a speculator on the road who offered a high price to buy it. He said: "I must sell it to the cooperative to help the country's construction. I won't talk nonsense with you." These all prove that as long as we carry out the necessary political work, we can not only educate farmers to overcome ideas such as "wait-and-see," but also mobilize farmers to oppose various destructive activities of grain speculators.

    Some comrades believe: "There is no need for propaganda to procure grain. As long as the listed price is reasonable, the masses will know to come and sell." Facts have proven that in many places, the listed prices were adequate, and the work of supplying materials was also done properly, but because the rationale was not explained to the masses, the masses were still waiting for prices to rise and were unwilling to sell. We should always remember: "In practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They both exist and function together. Anyone who wants to separate economics from politics in our practical work, strengthening economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, strengthening political work at the expense of weakening economic work, is bound to end up in a dead end." (Stalin, "On the Shortcomings of Party Work and Measures to Eliminate Trotskyist Double-Dealers and Other Double-Dealers")

    Strengthening political work of such great significance is very beneficial to farmers. This kind of political work is absolutely necessary and is by no means "interference" with farmers, and is by no means coercion or command. On the contrary, if we do not actively educate farmers to support national construction, if we do not "interfere" with the activities of speculators who undermine the worker-peasant alliance, and if we watch some farmers blindly embark on the dead end of capitalism without "interfering," then we are acting as the tail of backward masses, blindly promoting the capitalist spontaneous tendency of farmers, and abandoning the Party's leadership over farmers. It must be understood: Excessive interference with farmers (that is, incorrect interference) will certainly hinder the worker-peasant alliance; abandoning leadership over farmers, allowing the majority of farmers to be exploited by a few speculators again, and allowing some farmers to blindly embark on the dead end of capitalism, is an even more serious undermining of the worker-peasant alliance. It is right to be vigilant against making mistakes of coercion and command. However, some comrades have turned the logic upside down, forgetting that strengthening political work is precisely to enlighten the masses' consciousness and willingness to prevent coercion and command.

    In order to carry out political education for farmers in grain procurement, the following issues must be paid attention to at present.

    We must take the general line of the transition period, especially the relationship between the development of industrial production and agriculture, and the principles, methods, and steps for the socialist transformation of agriculture, as the main content of propaganda. Because, only when farmers understand these principles can they recognize the significance of grain procurement work and fundamentally solve the hoarding mentality of some farmers. The many vivid examples of farmers in various places immediately selling grain to the state after understanding the rationale that selling surplus grain is supporting the country's socialist industrial construction fully prove that the worries of some rural cadres who are afraid that farmers will not accept the major principles and dare not promote socialism are completely superfluous. On the contrary, not talking about the general line and not talking about socialism will create more obstacles to the work. Some cadres in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, only unilaterally publicized to farmers the benefits of the continuous narrowing of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products for farmers. As a result, farmers were even less willing to sell grain. They thought: Since grain is becoming more valuable year by year, wouldn't it be possible to buy more industrial products in the future if we hoard it and sell it later? We should learn a lesson from this: If we only use small favors to attract farmers, it will make farmers more concerned about immediate small gains, which is detrimental to various tasks in rural areas. However, on the other hand, it is also wrong to only tell the masses that grain procurement is beneficial to the country and to the long-term interests of farmers. Because, in fact, grain procurement is not only beneficial to the country and to the future of farmers, but also takes into account the immediate interests and current interests of farmers. If we only make one-sided explanations, it will not only be detrimental to procurement work but also cause the masses to misunderstand the general line.

    To publicize the general line to farmers and to publicize the socialist transformation of agriculture, the propagandists themselves must have a correct understanding of these issues. At present, the Party members and cadres of counties, districts, and townships who directly carry out propaganda and education to the masses and specifically lead propaganda work still have many misconceptions about the general line of the transition period and about grain procurement work. Among them, some people have not yet ideologically drawn a clear line with capitalism and do not fully understand the harm of the capitalist spontaneous tendencies among farmers. Therefore, whether the political work in grain procurement can achieve success, the key is to first organize cadres at all levels to earnestly study the general line of the transition period. In the study, the Party committee should advocate the spirit of boldly researching problems, encouraging everyone to raise various difficult problems as much as possible, and then conduct specific analysis and criticism based on the general line to arrive at correct conclusions. In the study, avoid being impatient and hasty, and avoid fearing debate and fearing the raising of different opinions. All cadres participating in the study must not only recite some articles but must boldly come into contact with the various problems raised by the masses.

    Attention must be paid to propaganda methods. To get farmers to understand the rationale, the rationale must be concretized with real people, real events, and farmers' own experiences. In this propaganda, various places have already gained a lot of experience in this regard. Propaganda workers in many places have learned to use methods of recollection, comparison, accounting, and commendation of good people and good deeds to enlighten the masses to recognize the significance of grain procurement. The propaganda departments of Party committees in various places should promptly summarize and promote various good propaganda methods to further overcome the simple and rigid style in propaganda work so that the propaganda of the national general line can deeply penetrate people's hearts.

    Our Party has rich experience in educating farmers, and the advanced farmers have already embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation under the leadership of the Party, which is a very good proof. As long as Party organizations at all levels are good at improving and expanding our political work based on new situations, we will not only be able to successfully complete the task of grain procurement, but also further advance our country's work on the socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 加强粮食收购中的政治工作

    加强粮食收购中的政治工作
    用合理的价格向全国有余粮的农民收购粮食，来保证全国工厂、矿山、城镇居民、解放军和志愿军部队、农村缺粮户和灾民的粮食供应，保证国家必要的粮食储备，稳定物价，消灭投机，限制农村中的资本主义活动，巩固工农联盟，这是国家经济建设时期的一项极端重要的政策。这不仅是重大的经济工作，也是重大的政治工作。
    在粮食收购的实际工作中，政治工作的巨大作用已经充分表现出来了。近来各地许多农民听到国家收购粮食的许多大道理，已经踊跃地把粮食卖给国家。如浙江兰溪县的农民听了区乡干部的讲话，懂得了国家收购粮食对于稳定物价、保障人民生活和进行建设的重大意义，又认识了国家收购粮食的价格是公平合理的，就扭转了“看涨惜售”的思想，踊跃售粮。清塘乡农民邵栋仂对干部说：“我过去不知道国家收购粮食做什么；现在才知道这是为了国家工业化建设，走社会主义的路。你们早这样讲，我早把稻谷卖给国家了。”他马上卖给国家四担稻谷。山西芮城县小麦上市时，有余粮的农民有的怕以后闹灾荒，有的等着涨价，有的怕卖了粮食“露富”，普遍不肯卖出余粮；有些人反而抢购囤积。中共芮城县委会运用宣传网，针对群众思想情况，开展了广泛的宣传活动。群众思想很快地有了转变，抢购粮食的现象停止了，小麦收购工作顺利地展开了。原来抢购现象最严重的城南乡，群众想通了道理以后，就实行集体售麦，一次卖出小麦一万三千多斤。许多地方向农民揭发了奸商囤积粮食、抬价、杀价等伤天害理的活动，大大地提高了农民对奸商的警惕。湖南衡南县三塘乡的农民听了宣传以后，又碰到奸商抬价套购粮食，就告诉他说：
  “你又想把粮食囤起来，将来好卖更高的价钱来剥削我们。再好的价钱，也不卖给你！”山东胶县十区后屯乡农民周宗发去供销合作社卖粮食，路上碰到投机商人用高价抢购，他说：“我一定要卖给合作社，帮助国家的建设，我不和你胡道道。”这些都证明，只要我们进行了必要的政治工作，不但可以教育农民克服“看涨惜售”等思想，而且可以动员农民去反对粮食投机分子的各种破坏活动。
    有些同志认为：“收购粮食用不着宣传，只要牌价定得合理，群众就晓得来卖。”事实已经证明，不少地方牌价挂足了，物资供应等工作也搞停当了，就是因为没有向群众讲清道理，群众就仍然等着涨价而不愿卖。我们永远都应该记住：“在实践中，政治和经济是分不开的。它们两者一同存在，一同起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以减弱政治工作为代价来加强经济工作，或者相反地，以减弱经济工作为代价来加强政治工作，那他就一定要陷入绝境。”（斯大林：“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”） 
    加强具有这样重大意义的政治工作，对于农民的好处是非常多的。这种政治工作是完全必要的，决不是对农民的什么“干涉”，决不是强迫命令。相反地，如果我们不积极教育农民支援国家建设，不去“干涉”投机分子破坏工农联盟的活动，眼看着有些农民盲目地走上资本主义的死路而不去“干涉”，那就是做了落后群众的尾巴，盲目地助长了农民的资本主义自发倾向，放弃了党对农民的领导。要知道：对农民干涉过多（就是说干涉得不正确），固然会妨碍工农联盟；对农民放弃领导，让多数农民重新受少数投机者的剥削，让一些农民盲目地走上资本主义的死路，对工农联盟就是更严重的破坏。警惕到不犯强迫命令的错误，这是对的。但是，有些同志却把道理弄颠倒了，忘记了加强政治工作正是为了启发群众的自觉自愿，防止强迫命令。
    为了在粮食收购中对农民进行政治教育，目前必须注意以下几个问题。
    我们必须以过渡时期的总路线，特别是发展工业生产对于农业的关系以及对农业进行社会主义改造的原则、方法和步骤为主要的宣传内容。因为，只有让农民懂得了这些道理，他们才能认识购粮工作的意义，从根本上解决部分农民的惜售思想。各地农民懂得了出卖余粮是支援国家的社会主义工业建设的道理，马上把粮食卖给国家的许多生动事例，完全证明我们有些农村干部怕农民接受不了大道理，而不敢宣传社会主义的顾虑完全是多余的。相反地，如果不讲总路线，不讲社会主义，反而会给工作造成更多障碍。黑龙江绥化县部分干部只片面向农民宣传工农业产品价格差额不断缩小对于农民的好处，结果，农民更不愿卖粮了。他们想着：既然粮食一年比一年值钱，囤积下来晚点卖，将来不是可以买更多的工业品吗？我们应该从这里得到教训：如果我们只用小恩小惠去吸引农民，就会使农民更斤斤计较眼前的小利，这对于农村中的各种工作都是不利的。但是另一方面，如果只对群众讲购粮有利于国家、有利于农民的长远利益，也是不对的。因为，实际上收购粮食不仅有利于国家，有利于农民的将来，并且也照顾了农民的切身利益和当前利益。如果只做片面的解释，不但不利于收购工作，而且会引起群众对总路线的误解。
    要向农民宣传总路线，宣传对农业的社会主义改造，必须宣传者本身对于这些问题有正确的理解。目前，直接向群众进行宣传教育和具体领导宣传工作的县、区、乡的党员和干部，对于过渡时期的总路线，对于购粮工作，还有不少错误认识。在他们当中，有些人还没有从思想上和资本主义划清界限，还不十分理解农民中资本主义自发倾向的危害性。因此，粮食收购中的政治工作能否获得成就，关键是必须首先逐级地组织各级干部认真地学习过渡时期的总路线。在学习中，党委应该提倡大胆研究问题的精神，启发大家尽量提出各种疑难问题，然后根据总路线进行具体的分析批判，得出正确的结论。学习中切忌急躁草率，切忌害怕争论、害怕提出不同意见。所有参加学习的干部必须不是仅仅背诵一些条文，必须大胆地接触群众提出来的多种多样的问题。
    必须注意宣传方法。要农民想通道理，必须用真人真事和农民的切身经历来把道理具体化。在这次宣传中，各地在这方面已经取得了不少经验。很多地方的宣传工作者已经学会用回忆、对比、算账和表扬好人好事的方法去启发群众认识购粮的意义。各地党委的宣传部门应该及时地对各种好的宣传方法加以总结推广，进一步克服宣传工作中的简单生硬作风，使国家总路线的宣传能够深入人心。
    我们的党是有着丰富的教育农民的经验的，先进的农民们已经在党的领导下走上了互助合作的道路，就是一个很好的证明。只要各级党组织善于根据新的情况来改进和扩大我们的政治工作，我们就不仅能够顺利完成粮食收购的任务，而且将要使我们的国家对农业的社会主义改造的工作推进一步。
