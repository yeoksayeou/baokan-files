Marshal Kim Il-sung's Speech at the Train Station

Dear Comrades:

    As the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea departs from Beijing, I would like to express, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people, our heartfelt gratitude to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Mao Zedong for the warm reception and deep care extended to our delegation.

    During our government delegation's stay in Beijing, we successfully held talks with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, discussing important political issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, economic and cultural cooperation between Korea and China, and the Chinese government's assistance in restoring the post-war Korean people's economy.

    As a result of the talks, in order to continue developing the traditional friendship between the two peoples and further strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, the Korean-Chinese Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement was signed. At the same time, the Chinese government will provide us with a huge amount of materials equivalent to 8 trillion yuan renminbi free of charge to restore the post-war Korean people's economy.

    This assistance from the fraternal Chinese people will greatly help accelerate the restoration and construction of our country's post-war people's economy and improve the lives of our people. It will further consolidate the democratic base that serves as the cornerstone of our country's peaceful reunification and strengthen our people's confidence in moving towards a free, happy, and bright future. At the same time, the signing of this agreement is fully in line with the happiness and interests of the people of Korea and China and has great significance in maintaining peace in the Far East.

    Our Korean people are proud to have the great neighbors of the Soviet Union and China standing firm. We will do everything possible to cherish the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China and the people of all countries in the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, just as we cherish our own eyes. I believe that the strength of the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China will surely shatter any conspiracy to undermine our just cause, and will become a strong guarantee for the peaceful reunification of Korea, the maintenance of world peace, and the security of Asia.

    Long live the militant friendship and unity of the people of Korea and China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    金日成元帅在车站上发表的谈话亲爱的同志们：
    值此朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团离开北京之际，我以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民的名义，对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府和毛泽东主席给予我们代表团的热情款待和深厚关怀，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们政府代表团在北京停留期间，与中华人民共和国中央人民政府顺利地进行了会谈，讨论了有关和平解决朝鲜问题的重要政治问题和朝中两国间经济文化合作问题，以及中国政府援助恢复战后朝鲜人民经济问题。
    会谈结果，为了继续发展两国人民间的传统的友谊，进一步加强两国间的经济文化合作，签订了朝中经济文化合作协定，同时中国政府为了恢复战后朝鲜人民经济，无偿地供给我们相当于八万亿元人民币的巨额物资。
    兄弟般的中国人民这次给我们的援助，在加速恢复建设我国的战后人民经济和提高我国人民的生活方面有极大帮助，更加巩固了作为和平统一我国基石的民主基地，更加坚定了我国人民走向自由、幸福、光明前途的信心，同时，这一协定的签订，完全符合于朝中两国人民的幸福和利益，并在维护远东和平事业中具有重大意义。
    我们朝鲜人民引以自豪的是有伟大邻邦苏联和中国屹然不动地存在着，我们要尽一切力量来爱护朝中两国人民以及以苏联为首的民主阵营各国人民间的友谊团结，就如同爱护自己的眼珠一样。我相信朝中两国人民友谊团结的力量，一定能粉碎企图破坏我们正义事业的任何阴谋，对于和平统一朝鲜事业以及维护世界的和平及亚洲的安全，成为坚强的保障。
    朝中两国人民的战斗的友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
