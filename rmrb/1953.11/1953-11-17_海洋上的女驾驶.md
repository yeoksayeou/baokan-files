    The Woman Driver on the Ocean
    By our reporter Lin Li
    (Continued from yesterday)
    Little Pei grew up in a great era. In her view, life is all about joy and happiness, and difficulties never exist. However, when she really had to steer and drive a boat on the ocean, her young heart couldn't help but feel a little nervous and beat a little unusually. Little Pei said:
    “Before coming to Xinhe, I had never seen the sea or a boat. I only saw a 'grab-yang style' dredger once during a visit to the Huai River construction site. I wanted to learn how to drive a boat, but I couldn't imagine what a boat was like. Besides, we came from the Huai River. Would they teach us in Xinhe? I also heard that the veteran masters were very conservative in the past, so on the way, our eight people discussed how to unite the veteran masters and how to learn the techniques well to serve the motherland... When we arrived in Xinhe and inquired, there were so many dredgers here, but not even one female crew member. Would they teach me, a woman? My concerns grew even greater. However, after careful inquiry, the situation was extremely good. Not only were the veteran masters not conservative, but they also took the initiative to unite with us! They also said: 'The Huai River project and the Xinhe project are both construction projects of our great motherland. If you learn the techniques and go back to improve the Huai River, we will also be honored!' They held a welcome party especially for us. Captain Zhang—that's Zhang Qingyuan of the 'Tanggu' dredger team—even gave a speech, saying that he would guarantee to teach us all the techniques he knew without reservation. The comrades here are extremely enthusiastic!
    “Captain Zhang was very concerned about us. He immediately assigned me to boat number three. Do you know boat number three? This boat is really not simple. The captain is the most technically skilled captain on the 'Tanggu' dredger—that's Mu Chengyi you saw! The chief driver is Shi Jingui, needless to say, he is the leader of the famous model group in Tianjin, and has met Chairman Mao in Beijing; my master Chen Junkui is also the best driver on this boat. Boat number three is really good at cultivating talent. On these dredgers in Tanggu Xinhe, almost all the apprentices taught here are there, and many have become leaders. I was assigned to this boat, and my enthusiasm for learning became even greater...
    “In the first few days, I visited various boats. Each of those boats had its own advantages and glory, but in my opinion, none of them were as good as Tanggu number three—the boat is easy to use, and the people are kind and full of young people. Everything is really good. If it's a holiday—say the National Day a few days ago! So many red flags were hung on the boat. A red flag on the left, a red flag on the right, red flags were stuck wherever they could be stuck. These red flags are not ordinary flags! They are award flags. Each red flag represents an achievement. When I stood at the bow and looked, the red flags said first prize, super prize. There were twelve awards from the Engineering Bureau alone. However, the award flags were not all hung up. The more I looked, the more I wanted to look, and the more I felt that boat number three was good. But when I first arrived on this boat, I couldn't sleep, I just listened to the roar of the machine. Guess what's happening now? Now I can't sleep if the machine doesn't sound. Once the machine starts, I sleep soundly and sweetly. In the middle of the night, if the machine suddenly stops, I immediately wake up, and like other crew members, I have to get up and take a look..."
    "Did you encounter any difficulties in your studies?" I asked.
    "Difficulties! What difficulties are there? The boat is good; the people are good. What difficulties are there? But I did encounter some problems at the beginning. For example, before coming to Xinhe, our captain told us: 'When you go to Xinhe, just learn how to drive the boats. What we lack is driving personnel. There is no problem with other sailors and engine room personnel.' But when we arrived in Xinhe, the captain here told us: 'If you want to be a driver on a "suction-yang style" dredger, you must start as a sailor. If you don't be a sailor yourself, you won't be able to command the sailors' work well in the future.' Upon hearing this, some comrades had ideological fluctuations. They said, we are here to learn to drive, why do we have to start as a sailor? They couldn't figure it out. Our group leader, Lao Ju, even held a meeting specifically for this matter. Yang Chaozhong—he is a member of the Communist Youth League—and I were the first to agree to start as sailors. We both said: 'If we don't be sailors ourselves, how can we command the sailors' work in the future!' In this way, the comrades who were making trouble couldn't make trouble anymore, and we started learning.
    "As soon as I got on the boat, I heard the comrades say they wanted to 'move the anchor'. What is an 'anchor'? I didn't understand it at all. The comrades on boat number three were very concerned about me. Seeing that I didn't understand anything, they advised me: 'Little Pei, you should go to the engine room and learn to manage the machines! That job is relatively light, and it is also convenient for female comrades. Being a sailor is not easy!' But I thought: My task is to learn to drive, how can I find something easy and convenient? I knew that the comrades were starting from caring for me, so I said: 'No, I am not afraid of difficulties, I will still be a sailor and learn to drive a boat.' The comrades agreed with my determination. However, they always didn't ask me to do heavy work, and I felt that this wouldn't work, I had to take the initiative. So, when they were punting oars, rowing sampans, and moving anchors, I also went to punt oars, row sampans, and move anchors. They carried coal onto the boat—more than 200 kilograms in a basket—and I rushed to carry it first. However, being a sailor is really not easy. There are four or fifty things to write down. Look at my study notes! Three whole pages are all 'sailor responsibilities'! The difficult thing is those tools, a lot of scattered things, I can't remember them. There was no way, so I drew them down one by one during the break, and then asked the masters to tell me their names and uses... Look, half of this notebook is filled with the shapes, names, and uses of the tools. But the most difficult thing was rowing the sampan. The first time I went up, I became dizzy after three or two shakes and vomited... Plus not being able to sleep at night, I doubted myself. I asked myself: 'Can't even someone as strong as me be a crew member?' The comrades saw that I was depressed and came to comfort me, saying: 'People who come to the boat for the first time have to go through the stage of seasickness, vomiting, and not being able to sleep. Don't be afraid, it will get better in a few days.' When I heard that these were the words of the veteran masters, it was probably correct. So I went to punt oars, row sampans, and move anchors with the comrades again. Strangely enough, once my thoughts were firm, I didn't get dizzy, didn't vomit, and fell asleep. If this is a difficulty, then I have overcome it.
    "I also forgot to tell you that I encountered an even bigger difficulty! Just as I was studying with enthusiasm, I got appendicitis. This damned appendicitis prevented me from studying for two weeks. It really made me anxious to death. Think about it, our study period is only three months in total, and appendicitis took up two weeks, how could I not be anxious! If I can't learn it, how can I go back? ... Soon after the operation, I asked to be discharged from the hospital. The doctor didn't allow it. After the first week, I asked to be discharged from the hospital again. The doctor said: 'You can be discharged, but you are not allowed to go on the boat, you must rest for another week.' How could I wait! As soon as I was discharged from the hospital, I ran to the boat... When I got on the boat, the comrades immediately kicked me off. They said: 'You can't even walk, your face is pale, and the incision hasn't healed yet, how can you work!' They scolded me while talking—like scolding their own child, and sent me to the port. They still don't let me do heavy work!
    "I should also tell you another thing: One evening when I was taking a break from work before the appendicitis operation, I saw a comrade who came to study with me, a Mr. Hu. He suddenly asked me: 'Little Pei, you came to Xinhe to study, do you know what our team members think of you?' This question made me confused. I thought studying is studying! What kind of views could there be! So I said: 'I don't know.' Mr. Hu continued: 'People say that Little Pei loves to play, has a childish temper, and doesn't want to use her brain. Don't think she's happy to go, she'll have a hard time when she comes back—people are sure you won't learn it.' This made me anxious. Why do people look at me like this, I can't figure out the reason. After thinking carefully: That's right! Among the eight comrades who came to study, three were technicians who had been captains on 'grab-yang style' dredgers. They had technology, so it was easy to learn. The other four comrades were either high school graduates or college students. They also learned quickly. Only I, Little Pei, have no culture, no technology, and I'm a woman, how can I catch up with them! I panicked, I was anxious, and I was emotional. But then I thought: Whether I learn it or not depends on myself. If I get emotional, then I really won't learn it. Besides, since the team sent me here, it means they believe I can learn it... I decided not to think about it anymore, and I will never be childish again. I will study harder. I must make those who want to see my 'joke' fail."
          ×××　×××　×××
    Little Pei was determined to make those who were sure she wouldn't learn it fail, she wanted to win. She did win. Her master Chen Junkui told me that Little Pei had already learned to drive. When dredging soft mud, she can work continuously for four hours like other crew members; when dredging hard mud, she can persist for an hour. In the future, as she slowly exercises and continues to learn in work, once she becomes proficient, she will be a formal driver.
    However, Little Pei is very strict with herself. When Chen Junkui said that she "had already learned it", she said humbly and sincerely:
    "No, I'm still far from it! I've learned how to dredge and drive the boat. But if there's a problem with the machine, I'll be dumbfounded. I'm worried about this these days! Because it's already October, and in another month, we won't be able to dredge here, we won't be able to study, and we'll have to go back. What should we do when we go back? If we leave the veteran masters, what should we do if the machine breaks down? If we write a letter to ask for instructions: it's another thousand miles away, how long will it take to receive a reply!
    "Our eight people have discussed it, and we have also asked Captain Zhang here, we want to bring a few veteran masters with us when we go back. But Captain Zhang said: 'Little Pei, you have to stay in Xinhe to work! You are the first female driver we have cultivated, and if you leave, we won't have a woman here anymore.' When he said this, I immediately remembered what the captain of our team said to me before Xinhe. He said: 'Little Pei, it's okay for you to go to study, but you can't not come back!' He said this when I was about to leave.
    "I'm worried about what to do when I go back? But I also think: Although the boats on our Huai River are also 'suction-yang style', they are not as large as these boats in Tanggu Xinhe, nor are they as complicated, and the operation is relatively easy. The comrades in Xinhe also said: 'Little Pei, if you learn to drive on these boats in Tanggu Xinhe, it will definitely not be a problem when you go to your boats.' My confidence is stronger. Besides, our 'suction-yang style' dredgers are all newly built in Shanghai, and they will be delivered at the end of this year. After we go back, we will first go to Shanghai to drive those 'suction-yang style' dredgers back to the Huai River!"
    Little Pei's imagination is beautiful. She wants to use the honor of being the first female sea driver in New China to drive the first batch of dredgers made by New China itself in Shanghai. Then, she will return to the great Huai River construction site, and on that epoch-making project, she will do her part. This beautiful imagination made me think of another question: "What will you do after the Huai River is cured?"
    "I'll go to school, study further, and learn navigation." She answered without hesitation.
    Such a bold and wonderful ideal, in the eyes of the older generation, may seem absurd and ridiculous. But for her, it is reality. She firmly believes that the country will cultivate her, and her ideal will become a reality. She can walk from the office of the Huai River construction site to the coast of northern China, so what can stop her from sailing to the ocean?
                                        (End)

    海洋上的女驾驶
    本报记者  林 里 
    （续  昨）
    小裴成长在伟大的时代，在她看来：人生就是欢乐和愉快，困难永远不存在。然而当她真要到海洋上来掌舵、驾船的时候，她那颗年轻的心，就不免有些紧张，也不免有些异乎寻常的跳动。小裴说：
    “来新港以前，我没有见过海，也没有见过船，只是在参观淮河工地的时候，见过一次‘抓扬式’挖泥船。我要学驾船，可是想像不出船是怎么个劲。再说，我们是淮河上来的，到新港学习，人家教不教哩？过去又听说老师傅们都很保守，因此还在半路上，我们八个人就商量着如何团结老师傅，如何把技术学好，回去为祖国服务……到新港一打听，人家这里那么多挖泥船，连一个女船员也没有。人家教不教我这么一个女的？顾虑更大了。然而仔细一问，情况可真好极了。老师傅们不光不保守，还主动地团结我们哩！人家还说：‘淮河工程，新港工程，都是伟大祖国的建设工程。你们学会了技术，回去把淮河治好，我们也光荣！’人家专为我们开了欢迎会，张队长——就是‘塘沽号’挖泥队的张庆元呵——还讲了话，说保证把他们懂得的技术，毫不保留地教给我们，人家这边的同志，可热情极啦！
    “张队长很关心我们。一下就把我分到三号船上。你知道三号船吗？这只船可真不简单。船长，是‘塘沽号’挖泥船上技术最好的船长——就是你看见的那个穆成义啊！正司机叫史金贵，那更不用说了，是天津市出名的模范小组的领导人，上北京见过毛主席；我的师傅陈俊奎，又是这个船上最好的驾驶。三号船在培养人材方面可真有办法。塘沽新港这些挖泥船上，差不多都有从这里教出来的徒弟，并且好多当了领导人。我被分配到这个船上，学习劲头就更大了……。
    “头几天，我到各个船上参观了一下。那些船上，都各有各的优点，又各有各的光荣，可是在我看来，那一个船也没有塘沽三号好——说船，船好使唤；说人，人又和气，尽是青年。真是什么都好。要是逢年过节——就说头几天过国庆节吧！船上挂起那么多红旗。左一面红旗，右一面红旗，能插旗的地方，都插上了红旗。这红旗，可不是一般的旗！是奖旗。每一面红旗，都代表着一件成绩。我站在船头上一看，红旗上写的都是一等奖、超等奖。光工程局奖的就有十二面。可是，奖旗并没有挂完。我真是越看越愿看，越看越觉着三号船好。但我才到这只船上的时候，我睡不着，光听着机器轰隆。你猜现在怎样呢？现在机器不响我就不能睡觉。机器一开动起来，睡得又甜又香。半夜里，要是机器猛然一停，我就立时一惊，和其他船员一样非起来看看不行……。”
    “你在学习中遇到过什么困难吗？”我问。
    “困难！有什么困难哩：说船、船好；说人，人好。有什么困难呢？不过开头倒遇见些问题。比如来新港以前，我们的队长告诉我们：‘你们去了新港，光学船只驾驶就行了，我们所缺乏的就是驾驶人员。其他水手、机舱人员都不成问题。’可是一到新港，这里的队长就告诉我们说：‘要想在“吸扬式”挖泥船上当驾驶，必须从水手学起。自己不当水手，将来就不能很好地指挥水手工作。’一听这话，当时就有些同志思想波动了。他们说，我们是来学驾驶的，为什么非从水手学起？想不通。我们的组长老巨，还专为这事开了个会。我和杨超中——他是青年团员——首先表示同意从水手学起。我俩都说：‘自己不当水手，以后怎么指挥水手工作！’这样一来，闹情绪的同志闹不起来了，我们开始学习了。
    “我一上船，听同志们说要‘移锚’，什么叫‘锚’？我根本不懂。三号船上的同志们都很关心我。他们见我什么也不懂，就劝我说：‘小裴，你还是到机舱里，学管机器吧！那个活比较轻巧，女同志也方便，水手可不容易呵！’可是我想：我来的任务就是学驾驶，怎么能找轻巧，图方便呢？我知道同志们是从爱护我出发的，就说：‘不，我不怕困难，还是当水手，学驾船。’同志们同意了我的决心。然而做重活总不叫我，我觉着这样下去不行，非争取主动不可。于是我见他们撑橹、摇舢舨、移锚，我也去撑橹、摇舢舨、移锚。他们往船上抬煤——一筐二百多斤重呀——我抢先争着抬。不过，水手工作可真不容易。一写出来，就有四、五十条。你看看我的学习笔记吧！整整三页纸都是水手责任’呀！困难的是那些工具，零零碎碎一大堆，记也记不住。没办法，我就在休息的时候，一件一件画下来，再请师傅们讲它的名称、用途……你看，这半个本子，都是工具形状、名称和用途。然而最困难的还是摇舢舨。头一回上去，三摇两晃就晕了，吐了……加上夜晚睡不着觉，我对自己怀疑了。我自问着：‘难道像我这么强壮的体格，也不能当船员吗？’同志们见我闷闷不乐，都来安慰说：‘初到船上的人，都要经过晕船、呕吐、睡不着觉的阶段，你不要怕，过两天就好了。’我一听是老师傅们的话，大概没错。我就又跟同志们一起去撑橹、摇舢舨、移锚。说也奇怪，思想上一坚定，也就不晕、不吐，也睡着了。如果说这是困难的话，那末，我都渡过了。
    “还忘了告诉你，我还遇到一个更大的困难哩！正当我学习得带劲的时候，我得了盲肠炎。这该死的盲肠炎，害得我两个礼拜不能学习。真要把我活活的急死了。你想想看，我们的学习时期，统共只有三个月，盲肠炎就占了两个礼拜，我怎么能不急哩！要是学不会，可怎么回去呢？……开刀不久，我就要求出院。大夫不允许。第一个礼拜过后，我又要求出院。大夫说：‘出院可以，但不准上船，必须再保养一个礼拜。’我怎么能等得及！一出院，就跑到船上来了……我上了船，同志们立刻把我赶下去了。他们说：‘你走都走不动，脸涮白，刀口还没有长好，怎么能工作呢！’他们连说带骂——像骂自己的孩子样，把我送到港上去了。直到现在还不让我做重活哩！
    “还应该告诉你另一件事：割盲肠炎以前，上港歇班的一天傍晚，见了和我一块来学习的同志，当中有位姓胡的。他忽然问我道：‘小裴，你来新港学习，你知道咱们队上的人，对你是个什么样的看法吗？’这句话问得我莫名其妙。我想学习就是学习吧！能有什么看法哩！于是我说：‘不知道。’姓胡的接着说：‘人家都说，小裴爱玩，孩子脾气，不愿费脑子。别看她走得高兴，回来时有她难看的——人们断定你学不会。’这一说可把我急坏了。人们为什么这样看我，我想不出道理。仔细一想：也是啊！来学习的八个同志，其中有三个是技术工人，在‘抓扬式’挖泥船上当过船长，他们有技术，学习起来当然容易。其余四个同志，不是高中毕业，就是大学生。人家学得也快。只是我小裴，没有文化，也没有技术，又是个女的，怎么能赶得上人家哩！这一想我慌了，我急了，闹情绪了。可是反过来又想：学会学不会，决定点在自己。要是一闹情绪，那可就真学不会了。再说，队里既然派我来，那就是相信我能学会……我决定不再想它，也决不再耍孩子脾气。我要更努力地学习。一定叫那些想看我‘笑话’的人们失败。”
          ×××　×××　×××
    小裴下决心叫那些断定她学不会的人失败，她要胜利。她果然胜利了。她的师傅陈俊奎告诉我说：小裴已经学会了驾驶。挖软泥，像其他船员一样，能连续工作四点钟；挖硬泥，能坚持一个小时。往后慢慢锻炼，在工作中继续学习，一熟练起来，就是一个正式的驾驶人员了。
    然而，小裴对自己很严格。当陈俊奎说她“已经学会了”的时候，她谦虚、又诚恳地说：
    “不行，还差得远呢！挖泥、驾船是学会了。要是机器一出毛病，可就傻眼了。这两天，我正为这事发愁哩！因为现在已经是十月了，再过一个月，这里就不能挖泥了，我们不能学习，就得回去了。回去怎么办呢？离开老师傅，机器出了毛病可怎么办呢？写信请示吧：又是一去一千多里，多会才能接到回信呢！
    “我们八个人商量过，也和这里的张队长要求过，我们回去时，带上几个老师傅。然而张队长却说：‘小裴，你可得留在新港工作呢！你是我们培养起来的第一个女驾驶，你走了我们这里又没有一个女的了。’他这一说，使我立时想起来新港前我们队里的队长对我说的话。他说：‘小裴，你去学习是可以的，可不能不回来呀！’这话又是当我动身临走时说的。
    “我发愁回去怎么办？可是又想：我们淮河上的船，尽管也是‘吸扬式’的，但没有塘沽新港这些船的规模大，也没有这样复杂，操作比较容易。新港的同志也说：‘小裴，你在塘沽新港这些船上学会了驾驶，再到你们那些船上，就绝对不成问题。’我的信心强了。再说，我们那些‘吸扬式’挖泥船，全是在上海新造的，今年年底就交货。我们回去以后，要先到上海，把那些‘吸扬式’挖泥船驾回淮河去！”
    小裴的想像是美丽的。她要以新中国第一名海上女驾驶的荣誉，去上海驾驶新中国自己制造的第一批挖泥船。然后，她回到伟大的淮河工地，在那划时代的工程上，尽她一分应尽的力量。她这美丽的想像，使我联想到另一个问题：“淮河治好以后，你还做什么呢？”
    “我进学校，深造，学航海去呀。”她毫不犹豫地回答说。
    这种大胆而美妙的理想，在老一辈的人看来，也许觉得是荒唐可笑的。然而在她来说是现实。她坚决相信国家会培养她，她的理想会变成现实。她能够由淮河工地的办公室里，走到祖国北方的海岸，那还有什么能阻挡得住她航行到海洋上去的理想呢？
                                        （完）
