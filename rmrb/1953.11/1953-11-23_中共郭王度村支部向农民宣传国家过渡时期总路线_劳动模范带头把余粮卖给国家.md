    The CCP Guo Wangdu Village Branch Propagandizes the General Line of the State During the Transition Period to Farmers; Labor Models Take the Lead in Selling Surplus Grain to the State

    The CCP Guo Wangdu Village Branch in the Fourth District of Anyang County, Henan Province, is conducting propaganda and education on the general line of the state during the transition period to farmers, promoting farmers to actively sell surplus grain to the state.

    The cadres of Guo Wangdu Village recently conducted a survey of the village's surplus grain situation. Although Guo Wangdu Village is a cotton-producing area, there are still 69 households with more than 45,900 jin of surplus grain until the wheat harvest next year. Recently, due to some farmers' insufficient understanding of the important significance of state grain procurement, some surplus grain households are storing grain instead of selling it, and are even buying grain.

    Based on the above situation, the CCP Guo Wangdu Village Branch held a mass meeting in the village, connecting the old and new societies, and the old and new lives, focusing on explaining the great help that the Communist Party and the People's Government have provided to agricultural production in terms of technical guidance and economic support over the past few years, and explaining the important significance of the state gradually realizing socialist industrialization and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, etc. during the transition period. The meeting pointed out to the masses of the village: "During the period of national planned economic construction, it is a most glorious thing for farmers to supply grain. Surplus grain households should actively sell surplus grain to the state, and at the same time, they must resolutely oppose hoarding grain."

    After the meeting, farmers throughout the village launched discussions in groups. Labor model Yao Fude compared his past and present production and living conditions and said excitedly: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led me to live a good life, and I will dedicate every bit of strength I have to the country. I have done the math, and our family has enough coarse grains to eat; in addition to eating six or seven dou of wheat during the New Year and holidays, we still have more than one shi left, and I will sell it to the country to support national economic construction. When the working class elder brothers have grain, they can produce more steel, consolidate national defense, and manufacture agricultural tools and machines to develop agricultural production." Under the leadership of Yao Fude, farmers expressed their willingness to sell surplus grain to the state. Guo Zhenyu said: "I was a long-term hired worker in the old society. After liberation, I became a militia captain, health committee member, and people's representative. I was allocated land and participated in mutual aid groups. Last year, I joined the cooperative, and my grain harvest is large, and my life is getting better every day. In the past, I simply thought that a good life was due to my own good management, and I forgot the leadership and support of the country. Now I express to everyone: I cannot finish eating my grain, and I will sell the surplus grain to the country tomorrow. I want to learn from Yao Fude and always follow the Communist Party!" Then, farmers Liu Haozhi, Lin Maoting, Yao Mingde, Lu Shanzheng, and others expressed that they must sell surplus grain to the state.

    Currently, propagandists in the village are further studying propaganda methods and approaches, preparing to do a more in-depth job of publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period.

    中共郭王度村支部向农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线
    劳动模范带头把余粮卖给国家
    中共河南省安阳县四区郭王度村支部，向农民进行国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，推动农民积极把余粮卖给国家。
    郭王度村的干部们最近对全村余粮情况作了调查。郭王度村虽然是产棉区，但到明年麦收时为止，还有六十九户有余粮四万五千九百多斤。近来由于有些农民对国家收购粮食的重要意义认识不足，有的余粮户存粮不卖，反而购买粮食。
    根据以上情况，中共郭王度村支部在村里召开了群众大会，联系新旧社会、新旧生活，着重说明了共产党、人民政府几年来对农业生产在技术指导和经济扶植方面的巨大帮助，说明国家在过渡时期逐步实现社会主义工业化和逐步实现对农业、手工业等的社会主义改造的重要意义。向全村群众指出：“在国家计划经济建设时期，农民供应粮食是一件最光荣的事情。余粮户应当积极把余粮卖给国家，同时必须坚决反对囤粮行为。”
    会后，全村农民分片展开讨论。劳动模范姚富德对比了自己过去和现在的生产、生活情况，激动地说：“共产党和毛主席领导我过了好时光，我有一分力量也要献给国家。我算了算帐，我们家粗粮已经够吃；小麦除了过年过节吃上六、七斗，还余一石多，我要卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。工人老大哥有了粮食，好多生产钢铁，巩固国防，制造农具、机器，发展农业生产。”在姚富德的带动下，农民纷纷表示要卖余粮给国家。郭振玉说：“我在旧社会常年当雇工，解放后当了民兵队长、卫生委员、人民代表，分了地，参加了互助组，去年又加入了合作社，粮食打的多，生活一天比一天强。过去我单纯地认为生活好是自己经管的好，忘了国家的领导和扶植。现在我向大家表示：我的粮食吃不完，明天把余粮卖给国家。我要学习姚富德，永远跟着共产党走！”接着，农民刘好志、林茂庭、姚明德、路善政等纷纷表示，一定要把余粮卖给国家。
    目前，该村宣传员正在进一步研究宣传方式、方法，准备更深入地做好国家过渡时期总路线的宣传工作。
