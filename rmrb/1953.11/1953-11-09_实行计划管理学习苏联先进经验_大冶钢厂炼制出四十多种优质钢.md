Implementing Planned Management and Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union
Daye Steel Plant Refines More Than Forty Kinds of High-Quality Steel

Since the Daye Steel Plant of the State-owned Central China Iron and Steel Company began implementing planned management and actively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in June of this year, it has reversed the situation of failing to complete the plan every month in the first half of the year. It has refined more than forty new types of high-quality steel for more than 300 units across the country, including high-quality carbon structural steel needed for manufacturing automobile and agricultural machinery structural materials, high-quality carbon tool steel needed for cutting tools and measuring tools, and various high-quality alloy steels needed for manufacturing crankshafts, gears, cylinder liners, special tools, etc. In order to further achieve balanced production and ensure the comprehensive completion of the production increase and economy plan, the plant is now launching a production increase and economy labor competition among all employees, focusing on continuing to implement planned management and the suggestions of Soviet experts.

At the beginning of this year, Daye Steel Plant was only a factory capable of smelting ordinary carbon steel. When accepting national orders for high-quality steel, more than 80% of the workers in various workshops were new workers and apprentices in steelmaking. Due to unfamiliar operations, defective products were frequently produced. A small number of veteran workers and technicians who mastered the technology of smelting high-quality steel also only inherited a set of old steelmaking methods that could not guarantee the quality of the steel. Under such conditions of backward technology, outdated equipment, and unbalanced production capacity, coupled with the plant's leadership's long-term neglect of management, the difficulties in production were further aggravated, causing national orders to frequently fail to be completed. Therefore, the plant was determined to organize employees to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improve steelmaking technology. In June of this year, Soviet experts Zhuyev and Chek Garov came to the plant to assist in the work, providing the plant with 24 items and 161 suggestions, resolving many technical difficulties. In addition to learning a lot of advanced technical theories and specific operating methods from Soviet steelmaking books, the employees also carefully studied the expert's demonstration operations and verbal suggestions in the workshop, and frequently checked the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions, organizing forces to help various workshops implement them. For example, in the forging workshop, according to the Soviet experts' suggestions of "high-temperature charging, rapid heating" and "taking hot steel ingots on one side and adding cold steel ingots on the other" to shorten the heating time, the heating speed of forging was increased by more than two times, and the output of steel increased by one time. In the electric furnace workshop, thanks to the painstaking research of the Soviet experts' suggestions and operating methods on changing to silicon powder instead of silica stone for slagging by section technician Luo Xilin and section chief Yu Jiameng, and conducting a week of experiments with workshop engineer Xiang Rusheng, they finally completely mastered the law of controlling silicon, reducing the non-metallic inclusions in the steel to the lowest limit. In addition, old equipment such as annealing furnaces was also renovated. According to the Soviet experts' suggestions, the entire plant also established a technical supervision organization and expanded the laboratory and physical room for testing the chemical composition and physical properties of high-quality steel to ensure the quality of the steel. Now the production situation of high-quality steel in Daye Steel Plant has been completely changed.

While conscientiously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the plant also gradually implemented weekly work plans, day and night work plans, and shift work plans, established and rectified various work systems, improved the administrative management and technical management at all levels, and brought into play the role of functional organizations, enabling the production order to be quickly established. In the first week of October, the plant's electric furnace, forging, heat treatment, and rolling steel workshops all comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans.

Now, the plant is launching a production increase and economy labor competition focusing on continuing to implement planned management and Soviet experts' suggestions to further achieve balanced production and ensure the comprehensive completion of the production increase and economy plan.

In addition: The employees of the open hearth furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant of Central China Iron and Steel Company successfully trial-smelted a certain high-quality steel ingot on October 5th. The chemical composition and physical properties of the steel ingot met the standards. The successful smelting of this high-quality steel ingot will enable Daye Steel Plant to expand its production of high-quality steel ingots by one and a half times, and the cost per ton of steel can also be reduced by 50% compared to electric furnace smelting. The high-quality steel produced by the open hearth furnace workshop according to the plan within this year can save the country 4.5 billion yuan in terms of cost reduction alone.

Before the trial smelting of this high-quality steel ingot, all the workers in the workshop studied the great significance of smelting high-quality steel for national construction. At the same time, engineer Li Juemin and others formulated new operating procedures based on the characteristics and requirements of this high-quality steel. The workers also carried out a technical study. Therefore, the trial smelting work went very smoothly. The smelting time was the same as the original smelting time for ordinary carbon steel. After the successful trial smelting, the workshop also carried out inspection and summary, found out the shortcomings in the ingot casting work and labor organization, and formulated improvement measures.

    实行计划管理学习苏联先进经验
    大冶钢厂炼制出四十多种优质钢
    国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂从今年六月份开始实行计划管理，积极学习苏联先进经验以来，扭转了上半年月月不能完成计划的情况，已为全国各地三百多个单位炼制出供制造汽车和农业机械构造材料需用的优质碳素结构钢、切削工具和量具需用的优质碳素工具钢以及制造曲柄轴、齿轮、汽缸套、特殊工具等需用的各种优质合金钢等四十多种新的优质钢钢种。为了进一步作到均衡生产，保证增产节约计划的全面完成，该厂现正以继续贯彻计划管理和苏联专家建议为中心，动员全体职工展开增产节约劳动竞赛。
    大冶钢厂在今年年初还是一个只能冶炼普通碳素钢的工厂。当接受国家优质钢订货时，各个车间工人中有百分之八十以上是新工人和初学炼钢的工人。由于操作不熟练，经常出废品。少数掌握冶炼优质钢技术的老工人和技术人员，也只承袭着一套旧的炼钢方法，不能保证钢的质量。在这样技术落后、设备陈旧和生产能力不平衡的状况下，加以该厂领导上长期忽视管理工作，更加重了生产上的困难，使国家订货任务经常不能完成。因此该厂决心组织职工学习苏联先进经验，提高炼钢技术。今年六月，苏联专家朱也夫和捷克加洛夫来厂帮助工作时，给该厂提出了二十四项一百六十一条建议，解决了很多技术上的困难。职工们除了从苏联炼钢书籍上学到很多先进的技术理论和具体的操作方法外，还认真地学习了专家在车间里的示范操作和口头建议，并经常检查苏联专家建议的执行情况，组织力量帮助各车间加以贯彻。如在锻造车间，根据苏联专家提出“高温装料、快速加热”和“一面取热钢锭、一面添冷钢锭”的缩短加热时间的建议，使锻造的加热速度提高了两倍多，钢材的产量提高了一倍。电炉车间，由于工段技术员罗锡林和工段长于家猛苦心研究了苏联专家关于改用矽粉代替矽石造渣的建议和操作方法，并会同车间工程师向儒生等进行了一星期的试验，终于，他们完全掌握了控制矽的规律，使钢内非金属夹杂物减低到最低限度。此外，退火炉等旧设备也作了改造，全厂根据苏联专家建议，又建立了技术监督机构，并扩大了试验优质钢化学成分和物理性能的化验室和物理室，以保证钢的质量。现在大冶钢厂优质钢的生产情况已经完全改观。
    与认真学习苏联先进经验的同时，该厂也逐步实行周作业计划、昼夜作业计划与轮班作业计划，建立与整顿了各种工作制度，健全了各级行政管理与技术管理工作，发挥了职能机构的作用，使生产秩序很快建立起来。十月份第一周该厂的电炉、锻造、热处理、轧钢四个车间都全面超额完成了生产计划。
    现在该厂正以继续贯彻计划管理和苏联专家建议为中心，展开增产节约劳动竞赛，进一步作到均衡生产，保证增产节约计划的全面完成。

    又讯：华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂平炉车间职工在十月五日试炼某种优质钢锭成功，钢锭的化学成分和物理性能都合乎标准。这种优质钢锭的冶炼成功，将使大冶钢厂冶炼优质钢锭的生产扩大一倍半，每吨钢的成本也可比电炉冶炼的降低百分之五十。平炉车间按计划在今年年内所生产的优质钢，仅在降低成本方面，就可以给国家节约四十五亿元。
    在试炼这种优质钢锭之前，全车间的工人学习了关于冶炼优质钢对国家建设的重大意义。同时，由工程师李觉民等根据这种优质钢的特点和要求，制订了新的操作规程。工人们又进行了一次技术学习。因此，试炼工作进行得很顺利。冶炼的时间和原来冶炼普通碳素钢的时间一样。试炼成功后，车间又进行了检查和总结，找出了铸锭工作和劳动组织中的缺点，并订出了改进办法。（王澈）
