    New Workday System—New Work Style
    Soviet Union, Alalichev, Verichev, Sokolov

Editor's Note: Since the Soviet Council of Ministers stipulated the new workday system, Soviet agencies have successively followed suit. "Pravda" published an editorial on this matter on September 1 (translation in the September 23rd issue of this newspaper, page 3). Since then, Soviet newspapers have successively published reports on the implementation of this system. The following is an excerpt from an article titled "New Workday System—New Work Style" written by Alalichev, Verichev, and Sokolov, published in the Soviet "Literary Gazette" on September 29:

    One, Compact Time

    When there was a quarter of an hour left before work, we entered the building on Nogen Square with the staff of the Ministry of Coal Industry. A line of people was waiting at the elevator entrance, and some impatient people walked up the stairs. At exactly nine o'clock, everyone arrived at their office. They knew that no one would bother them, interrupt their work, or invite them to meetings, because meetings were prohibited in the Ministry of Coal Industry in the morning; therefore, they concentrated on their work from the first minute.

    A clear workday system strengthens discipline and requires everyone to take more responsibility!

    Comrade Valonkov, the chief of the Ural-Karaganda and Central Asian Coal Mine Excavation Section, said: "How much time was wasted and how much damage was done to health because we didn't sleep at night in the past! What was it like before? I arrived very late, and before I arrived, no one in our section led the work. After I arrived, I went to attend meetings, so the work in the section was still without leadership. There were countless meetings to attend. There were no regulations for lunch time either. Staff members went to eat whenever they felt like it. When I went to find a staff member from another section or bureau, I often found him having lunch. How much time was wasted in this situation? Now, the entire ministry eats at the same time, so this situation is gone."

    Before September 1, most of the staff came to the ministry every night, working several hours more each day than they do now. The staff we met all agreed that the efficiency of working at night was very low.

    The first few days of implementing the new system showed that they could do more work now than before, and they could do it better, and all of this was done entirely within the working hours stipulated by the normal workday system.

    In the past, there was an unwritten but generally accepted rule: "Whoever doesn't work every night is not a good staff member!" Therefore, in the General Machinery Bureau, the director, three deputy directors, and section chiefs all worked in the bureau every night. Sitting from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock at night—this was considered part of their job; sometimes it was past twelve o'clock, even until two or three o'clock in the morning—this was not considered part of their job. What did they do while sitting there? Mainly waiting for the leader's summons.

    At the same time, they worked leisurely during the day and could avoid the main business for some small matters. Everyone thought of doing the work they didn't have time to do during the day at night. So, they wandered aimlessly from this office to that office, gossiping, and talking loudly in the corridors. But now, everyone knows that he must finish all his work before six o'clock in the afternoon. This requires everyone to be disciplined and to improve work efficiency.

    Because all the leaders go to work and leave work with the ordinary staff, all problems can be solved without delay.

    After three or four hours of effective labor is one hour of lunch time. In the past, from twelve o'clock to five o'clock in the day, everyone went to lunch according to the time stipulated in the form (actually, whenever they felt like it). This phenomenon is gone now. The entire ministry is scheduled to have lunch within the same hour.

    In the evening, after work is over, only the duty officers remain in the ministry. The duty officers use the telephone to contact coal mines across the country, but this is limited to talking to the duty officers of each coal mining company. It is not allowed to call the leaders and staff of coal mining companies, trusts, and mines to talk on the phone in the evening.

    Two, After Six O'Clock…

    After leaving the Ministry of Coal Industry building, I immediately met a couple.

    "How is it?" I asked.

    "Strict discipline! I have been to the theater four times in the past few days. The books I needed to read have been put on the shelf. Recently I accepted a social work assignment—immediately participating in the parent-teacher association work of my daughter's school. I also often supervise my son's studies at university. I'm not used to it yet, so I'm surprised how many things there are! It turns out I can do so much for my family, for myself, and for the people."

    Smirnov, the deputy chief of the Planning Section, said: "In the thirteen years I have worked in the ministry, this is the first time I have spent every night at home with my children. I have three children, all of whom are in school. In the past, I rarely saw their study logs. Now I can say that I can often check how their homework is done. Sometimes the whole family watches TV together, how happy is that!"

    There is no doubt that the work and lifestyle of Soviet staff members have undergone tremendous changes. However, as with any new thing, tremendous changes are produced in the process of eliminating all obstacles to the new thing. The so-called "trivialities of daily life" have great significance here. At present, many urgent problems have arisen that must be solved and can be solved.

    Three, Problems to be Solved

    To this day, there are still many people with deeply ingrained habits of working late into the night in many ministries.

    Some people argued with them. We participated in a debate. We sympathize with those who convincingly proved that coal production can still be increased within the working hours stipulated by the normal work system. The only problem is that everyone must take more responsibility for their work and exert more initiative. In other words, the problem lies in the professional level of the staff.

    It is worth noting that many engineers, party activists, and division chiefs and section chiefs always ask the same question in conversation: "What should the staff in the ministry be like?"

    Most people believe that if a student who has just graduated from school has not worked in a mine, then he cannot successfully take on the work task. A planning engineer argued this point:

    "Why do the staff of the Planning Section always drag their work into the evening during the last few days of the month? Because to formulate the tasks and plans for the next month, there must be complete materials and comprehensive data from various places, but the inexperienced staff in the ministry and in the localities hinder the smooth progress of this work. Often, they have to make several phone calls, re-sort it several times, or re-check it several times."

    Another group of people admitted that this situation was abnormal, but then he would say to you with a sarcastic tone: "Someone is already nagging: Why doesn't my subordinate go to work an hour earlier? Why doesn't he take his work home to do, why doesn't he work at night?" Then, they said some reasons: "Good! The workday system in the ministry is implemented very well, and after six o'clock in the evening, only the duty officers are in the ministry. But what about the localities?… Please ask the Neshdangnaya Coal Mine or any coal industry trust, are there people there every night other than the duty officers? No problem, I guarantee there are!"

    In many local coal companies, people still stay in the office working until midnight.

    Obviously, if they have transformed their work on Nogen Square (note: here are the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Ministry of Power Stations and Electrical Machinery Industry), then they have not completely done so in the localities. It is clear that assaultism is unusually deeply rooted in many mines, and the Ministry of Coal Industry has been too slow and too unswerving in breaking this bad work style.

    Four, Obstacles and Possibilities

    There were also many complaints. As a result of a survey of sixty-two staff members of the Ministry of Coal Industry, forty-nine expressed dissatisfaction with the transportation work in Moscow. The transportation work is too slow in adapting to the new task—getting a large army of staff to work quickly and comfortably at the same time.

    At the same time as the ministries and other central agencies go to work at nine o'clock, so do the shops, clinics, and daily necessities manufacturing plants and labor unions. This creates inconvenience in two ways: first, the number of people going to work at the same time greatly increases; second, staff members have no way to use these service agencies outside of working hours.

    The agencies that serve the daily life and cultural needs of the working people should work more flexibly.

    In this regard, serious demands should also be made on the "House of Engineers and Technicians" of the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry. ... On thirty free evenings, what does the "House of Engineers and Technicians" use to arouse people's interest? Probably, only one evening commemorating Tolstoy. There are many planned methods, but many rooms, as well as the library and reading room, are empty every night.

    It is surprising that the management office of the "House of Engineers and Technicians," after understanding that it is necessary to transform the work of this unit, stands high above, without analyzing the growing new demands of the staff, and only does some work in form. The library received a large number of new books on literature and technology, but did not introduce them to the readers, nor was it good at inspiring the readers' interest. Once, a lecture was held in a hall that could accommodate five hundred people, but only fifty people attended. What's going on? It turned out that a lecture on the same topic had already been held in the ministry.

    The current "House of Engineers and Technicians" is not more attractive than before, which is not surprising at all. Why? Because the people here have forgotten that the staff is willing to spend the evening with their families, and now they can also fulfill their wishes. But, in order to make the staff come to the club with their families, what did the club do? Do the wives and children of the staff also like to listen to the technical reports and lectures that the staff themselves want to listen to? In addition to books, newspapers, and chess, can they play something else? Isn't the amateur performance that hasn't been organized yet also attracting their interest?

    Almost a month has passed, and the staff has become accustomed to having free time every night, and every night should have a certain content. But what content to fill it with? This is not a trivial question. This question involves cultural needs (now special attention should be paid to the cultivation of interests and habits) and cultural supply. Is it possible to allow such a large ministry to not have a substantial technical library, and, in general, to always put the work of the library in an unimportant position?

    These problems we have thought of should attract the attention of the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union organizations.

    There is also an important issue—this is the issue of learning. Now, the time that can be used for learning has increased, and the number of people who desire to learn has also increased significantly, but the objective conditions for improving professional level are still the same as before. Some engineers raised an opinion in conversation with us—several groups can be attached to the Coal Industry Institute so that the staff of the Ministry of Coal Industry can participate in learning to improve their professional level.

    In the first few days of the implementation of the new workday system, the number of people applying to correspondence schools and specialized schools greatly increased. Experts are once again writing unfinished dissertations or summarizing books on their own work experience. The creative thinking of the vast ranks of Soviet intellectuals appears more active and more positive.

    Helping our staff make full use of the advantages and conveniences of the new strict work system—this is a task that should be solved in an all-round way. Here, it is necessary to gather the strength of the administrative and mass organizations in the agencies. Here, the strength of the staff of commerce, transportation, food industry, entertainment industry, as well as clinics and clothing stores, daily necessities manufacturing industry and public utility agencies should be combined.

    Of course, this should not only be done by the Moscow agencies, but also by the agencies in other cities—we must know that the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers requires not only the central agencies to establish a strict system, but also the local agencies must establish it.

    There is no doubt that the new work system will soon show its superiority in improving the work of the agencies and improving people's professional skills, expanding their political and cultural knowledge, and strengthening their education of the younger generation.

    新的工作日制度—新的工作作风  
    苏联  阿拉里契夫、维里契柯、索柯洛夫编者按：自苏联部长会议规定了新的工作日制度以后，苏联各机关即先后遵照执行。“真理报”九月一日曾为此发表社论（译文见九月二十三日本报三版）。此后，苏联报纸曾陆续刊登关于这一制度实行情况的报道。现将九月二十九日苏联“文学报”所载阿拉里契夫、维里契柯、索柯洛夫合写的题为“新的工作日制度—新的工作作风”一文摘译如下：
    一、紧凑的时间
    在还差一刻钟就要上班的时候，我们和煤矿工业部的工作人员一起走进了座落在诺根广场上的大厦。在电梯门口排着一队人，另外一些性急的人就步行走上楼去。九点正，每个人都到了自己的办公室。他们知道，谁也不会妨碍他们，不会打断他们的工作，邀他们去开会，因为在煤矿工业部上午是禁止开会的；因此，从第一分钟起就集中精力做工作。
    明确的工作日制度加强了纪律，并且要大家尽更多的责任！
    瓦隆柯夫同志是乌拉尔·卡拉冈达和中亚煤矿开掘科科长，他说：“过去由于晚上不睡觉耗费了多少时间，多么损害健康！以前是怎样的呢？我到得很晚，在我未到以前，我们科的工作人员没有人领导。我来了后，就去参加会议，因此，科里的工作仍旧没有领导。要参加的会议实在多得无数。午饭时间也没有什么规定。工作人员什么时候想起来就什么时候去吃。当我去找其他科或局的某个工作人员时，常常碰到他正在吃午饭。有多少时间浪费在这种情形上？现在，整个部都在同一个钟点吃饭，这样的情形就没有了。”
    在九月一日以前，大部分工作人员每天晚上都到部里来，每天要比现在多做好几小时的工作。我们所遇到的工作人员都一致认为夜晚工作的效率是很低的。
    新制度执行的头几天就表明：现在能比以前做更多的工作，并能把工作做得更好，而且，这都是完全在正常工作日制度规定的工作时间中做的。
    在以前，有一条虽无明文规定，但被公认的法规：“谁不在每天晚上工作，谁就不是好的工作人员！”因此像在总机械局里，局长、三位副局长和科长们每天晚上都在局里工作。从晚上九点坐到十二点——这算是份内工作；有时还过十二点，一直坐到深夜两、三点钟——这不算是份内的工作。他们坐着做什么呢？主要是等领导的召唤。
    同时，他们在白天工作得很悠闲，为一些小事可以避开正事。每个人都想到晚上做他白天没来得及做的工作。于是，就无目的地从这个办公室溜到那个办公室串起门子来了，在走廊里高谈阔论起来了。而现在，每个人都知道他必须在下午六点钟前做完所有的工作。这就要每个人守纪律，要每个人把工作效率提得更高。
    由于所有的领导者都与普通职员一同上班一同下班，一切问题就可以毫无拖延地解决。
    在三、四小时的有效劳动后是一小时的午饭时间。以前是这样的：在白天十二点到五点，大家按照表格规定的时间（实际上是随便什么时候）去吃午饭。现在这种现象没有了。整个部里的人都规定在同一点钟内吃午饭。
    在晚间，工作完毕后，留在部里的只是值班的人。值班的人用电话与全国煤矿联系，但这也仅限于和各煤矿公司的值班的人谈话。不允许在晚间把煤矿公司，托辣斯和矿井的领导人和工作人员叫来通话。
    二、六点以后……
    离开煤矿工业部大厦后，我立即遇到了一对夫妇。
    “怎样？”我问。
    “严格的纪律！近几天来我已去看过四次戏。必需看的书已放到书架上。最近我接受了一件社会工作——立即参加我女儿的学校的家长会工作。我还时常监督我的儿子在大学学习。我还没有习惯，因此很惊奇，怎么有这么多的事情！原来我能为家庭，为我自己，为人民做这样多的事情。”
    计划科副科长斯米尔诺夫说：“我在部里工作的十三年来，这是初次每晚与我的孩子们一起在家度过。我有三个孩子，他们都在学校念书。以前很少看到他们的学习日志。现在我可以说，我能经常检查他们的家庭作业做得怎样。有时还一家子在一起看电视，这是多么快乐啊！”
    毫无疑问，苏联工作人员的工作和生活方式发生了巨大的转变。但是，与任何新的事物一样，巨大的转变没有不是在消除一切对新事物的阻碍的过程中产生的。所谓“日常生活的小事”在这里也就有了重大的意义。目前，已产生了不少必须解决和可以解决的迫切问题。三、尚待解决的问题
    到现在，在许多部里仍然还有很多积习很深的在半夜办公的人。
    有人与他们争执起来了。我们参加了一次争论。我们同情那些使人信服地证明了在正常的工作制度规定的工作时间中仍能提高产煤量的人。问题仅在于每个人要对自己的工作负更多的责任，发挥更多的主动性。换句话说，问题在于工作人员的业务水平。
    值得注意的是许多工程师，党的积极分子和处长及科长在谈话中总是问同样的问题：“部里的工作人员应该怎样？”
    大部分的人都认为要是一位刚从学校毕业的学生没在矿井中工作过，那么，他就不能顺利地担负起工作任务来。有一个计划工程师论证了这点：
      “为什么计划科的工作人员在月底那几天老要把工作拖到晚上呢？因为要制订下一个月的任务和计划就必须要有各地方的完善的材料和综合资料，而部里和地方上的没有经验的工作人员却妨碍了这个工作的顺利的进行。往往总要打电话问几次，重整理几遍或再检查几次。”
    另外一部分人承认这种情形是不正常的，但是他接着就会带着讽刺的口吻对你说：“有人已在唠叨开了：为什么我的下属不早一小时上班呢？为什么他不把工作带到家里去做，为什么不在晚上搞工作呢？”然后，他们又说出一些道理来：“好啊！在部里工作日制度实行得很好，晚上六点后就只有值班的在部里了。可是，地方上怎样呢？……请你问一问涅什当纳雅煤矿或者是任何一个煤业托辣斯，是不是每天晚上除值班的以外还有人在那里？不成问题，保险有！”
    好些地方的煤业公司直到半夜仍有人呆在办公室里工作。
    显然，如果在诺根广场上（按：此处有煤矿工业部，冶金工业部，石油工业部和电站和电机工业部）他们已改造了自己的工作，那么在地方上则还没有完全这样做。很清楚，在许多矿场里突击主义异常根深蒂固，而煤矿工业部对于打破这种恶劣的工作作风却做得太慢和太不坚决。
      四、阻碍和可能
    抱怨也不少，向六十二个煤矿工业部工作人员调查的结果，有四十九个对莫斯科市的交通工作表示不满。交通工作在适应新任务上——在同一时间内使人数众多的工作人员大军又快又舒适地到达工作地点——做得太慢了。
    在九点钟与各部和其他中央机关同时上班的还有商店、诊疗所和日用品制造厂和劳动组合。这样就造成了两方面的不便：第一、同时上班的人数大为增加；第二、职员们在工作时间以外，没有可能利用这些服务机关。
    为劳动人民日常生活及文化需求服务的机关应该工作得更灵活些。
    在这方面，还应当向苏联煤矿工业部的“工程师和技术人员之家”提出郑重的要求。……在三十个空闲的晚上，“工程师和技术人员之家”以什么引起人们的兴趣呢？大概，只有一次纪念托尔斯泰的晚会。计划中的办法是有很多的，可是，很多房间以及图书馆和阅览室则每天晚上都是空的。
    使人惊异的是，“工程师和技术人员之家”的管理处，在懂得必须改造本单位的工作之后，即高高在上，不去分析工作人员日益增长的新要求，只是在形式上做一些工作。图书馆得到了大批的文艺和技术方面的新书，而不去对读者们介绍，也不善于启发读者们的兴趣。有一次，在一个能容五百人的大厅中举行了演讲会，但听讲的只有五十人。这是怎么一回事呢？原来在部里才已举行过同一题目的演讲会。
    现在的“工程师和技术人员之家”并不比以前更吸引人，这是一点也不奇怪的。为什么呢？因为这里的人已忘记了职员愿意与家人一起度过夜晚，而且现在他们也能如愿以偿。但是，为了使工作人员与家人一起到俱乐部来，俱乐部做了些什么呢？工作人员的妻子儿女是否也喜欢听工作人员本人要听的技术报告和讲演呢？除了书报和下棋外，他们是不是还能玩些别的东西呢？难道至今还没有组织起来的业余表演也引不起他们的兴趣吗？
      已经过了将近一个月了，工作人员已习惯了每天晚上时间是自由的，要使每个晚上都有一定的内容。但是以什么内容来充实它呢？这不是无所谓的问题。这问题涉及文化需要（现在特别应该注意到兴趣和习惯的培养）和文化供应。这么大的一个部却没有一个充实的技术图书馆，并且，一般总是把图书馆的工作放在不关重要的地位，这种情形难道能容许吗？
    我们所想到的这些问题应当引起党、青年团、工会组织的注意。
    还有一个重要的问题——这就是学习问题。现在，可以用来学习的时间已经增加，渴望学习的人也显著地增多了，但是，提高业务水平的客观条件仍旧与以前一样。有些工程师在与我们谈话时提了一个意见——在煤矿工业学院中可以附设几个小组，以便煤矿工业部的工作人员参加学习提高业务水平。
    在新的工作日制度实行的头几天，申请进函授学校和专科学校的人就大为增加。专家们重又下笔写还未结束的学位论文或总结自己工作经验的书。苏联知识分子的广大队伍富有创造性的思想显得更为活跃、更为积极了。
    帮助我们的工作人员尽量利用新的严格的工作制度的优点和便利条件——这是一个任务，它应该通盘地来解决。在这里，需要集合机关中的行政和群众团体的力量。在这里，商业、运输业、食品业、娱乐业以及诊疗所和成衣店，日用品制造业和公用事业机关的工作人员的力量应该结合起来。
    当然，这不仅要莫斯科机关这样作，还要其他城市的机关也这样作——要知道苏联部长会议的决定不仅要中央机关建立严格的制度，地方上的机关也必须建立。
    没有疑问，在改善机关的工作和提高人们的业务方面，扩大他们的政治和文化的知识方面，以及加强他们对年轻一代的教育的工作方面，新的工作制度一定会很快地表现出它的优越性来。
