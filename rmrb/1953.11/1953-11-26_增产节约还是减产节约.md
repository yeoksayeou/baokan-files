Increase Production and Practice Economy or Reduce Production and Practice Economy
    Ding Yiqun

    The Wu Lianshan Mutual Aid Team in Yuantan Township, Tanggou District, Hudong County, Anhui Province, in order to respond to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, specifically formulated a written plan for increasing production and practicing economy. This plan paid particular attention to "economy." For example, in sowing wheat, local wheat fields require at least 14 jin of wheat seeds per mu, but the Wu Lianshan Mutual Aid Team plans to implement spot sowing, using only 4 jin of wheat seeds. Comparing the two: 10 jin of wheat seeds are saved per mu, and 100 jin of wheat seeds are saved per 10 mu. Extrapolating in this way, the amount saved would indeed be very large.

    According to this plan, economy is certainly achieved, but can it increase production? That is a bit uncertain. A simple and clear principle is: if the wheat seeds used are reduced by more than two-thirds compared to that used in general wheat fields, how can one expect its yield to exceed that of general wheat fields? Moreover, the experience of many places has already proven that one of the keys to increasing wheat yield per unit area is dense planting of wheat, not sparse planting of wheat. Therefore, if this plan is not a plan that is not intended to be implemented at all, then it must be a plan to reduce production.

    However, such a plan was actually supported by Yao Zhengye, Deputy Secretary of the Tanggou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who had the original plan printed in large quantities and distributed to various villages. Furthermore, in the name of the "Tanggou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party," he issued a production circular, saying that "this plan is very good and is hereby forwarded to various places for reference." A ridiculous plan, a ridiculous circular, how dare those who truly respond to the call for increasing production and practicing economy "refer" to it!

    增产节约还是减产节约
    丁益群
    安徽湖东县汤沟区源潭乡吴连山互助组，为了响应增产节约号召，特别制订了一个书面的增产节约计划。这个计划，非常注意“节约”。如像播种小麦，当地每亩麦田至少需要十四斤麦种，吴连山互助组却准备实行点播，只用四斤麦种。两者比较：一亩地节省十斤麦种，十亩地节省一百斤麦种。这样的推算下去，节约的数字的确会是很大的。
    依照这个计划，节约诚然是节约了，可是，能不能增产呢？可就有点不大保险。一个简单而明白的道理是：麦种比一般麦田用的减少三分之二以上，怎么能期望它的产量超过一般麦田。何况，现在许多地方的经验已经证明，提高小麦单位面积产量的关键之一是小麦密植，而不是小麦稀植。因此，这个计划如果不是根本不准备实行的计划，那就必然是个减产的计划。
    但是，这样的计划，居然获得中共汤沟区区委副书记姚正业的支持，他将原计划大量油印，散发各村。并且，以“中共汤沟区委会”的名义，发出生产通报，说是“该计划很好，特转发各地参考”。一个荒唐的计划，一个荒唐的通报，真正响应增产节约号召的人，怎么敢“参考”呢！
