    Suiyuan Province State-Run Animal Husbandry Improvement Farms
    Improve Livestock Breeds for Farmers and Herdsmen
    The state-run animal husbandry improvement farms in Suiyuan Province are providing breeding services for the livestock of farmers and herdsmen, which has been welcomed by Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen. This year, the Suiyuan Province State-Run Stud Farm Improvement Farm has established more than ten breeding stations in areas such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the Ikh Juu League and Ulanqab League, using Kabardin stallions to mate with more than four thousand seven hundred local mares, exceeding the mating plan. The five breeding stations of the cattle improvement farm have used Dutch and other breeds of cattle to breed with more than nine hundred local cows for farmers. The breeding stations of the sheep improvement farm have used Zegai rams to mate with more than two thousand local ewes. Currently, apart from the horse breeding improvement work which has already concluded, the cattle and sheep breeding improvement work is still ongoing.
    Last year, the state-run animal husbandry improvement farms in Suiyuan Province provided breeding services for more than three thousand four hundred local mares, and more than six thousand local cattle and sheep. The Kabardin hybrid foals born this year are strong and develop quickly. The first generation of improved sheep bred with Zegai rams have fine and dense wool and grow well.

    绥远省各国营种畜改良场
    为农牧民改良牲畜品种
    绥远省各国营种畜改良场为农牧民的牲畜配种，受到蒙汉族农牧民的欢迎。绥远省国营种马改良场今年在伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟自治区等地设立了十多个配种站，用卡巴金种马交配了四千七百多匹民间母马，超额完成了配马计划。种牛改良场的五个配种站已用荷兰等种牛给农民配了九百多头母牛。种羊改良场各配种站以茨盖种羊给民间交配的母羊已达二千多只，现在，除马的配种改良工作已经结束外，牛、羊配种改良工作还正在继续进行。
    绥远省各国营种畜改良场去年曾为民间配马三千四百多匹，配牛配羊六千多头。今年产下的卡巴金杂种小马体格强壮，发育很快。茨盖种羊配出的第一代改良羊，毛质细密，生长良好。
