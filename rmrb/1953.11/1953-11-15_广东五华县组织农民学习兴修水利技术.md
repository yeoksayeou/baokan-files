Wuhua County, Guangdong Province, is utilizing the agricultural off-season to run training classes, organizing peasants to learn the knowledge and technology of building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. Last winter and this spring, Wuhua County mobilized more than 500,000 laborers to restore and build more than 3,400 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, including more than 290 small reservoirs. However, during the summer drought this year, many projects did not work. After inspection, the following shortcomings were found to be common in the projects: 1. The earth dams of mountain ponds and reservoirs were very thin, and the slopes were steep. No attention was paid to compaction during dam construction, and many projects leaked water. 2. The silt, grass roots, branches, etc. on the base were not removed during dam construction, and the new and old soil were not tightly combined, resulting in an unstable dam foundation. 3. The spillways were generally not wide or deep enough, and floods easily overflowed the top of the dam. Some mountain ponds did not even have spillways. 4. Many mountain ponds did not have horizontal or vertical pipes, or the water outlet culvert switches were difficult to operate. 5. Most of the water slopes did not have revetments, and the banks were eroded by water, causing cracks. There was no stone revetment below the large water slopes, and the foot of the slope was often eroded into deep pools, causing the slope to be suspended and prone to seepage and collapse. The inspection revealed that the reason for these defects was mainly that farmers lacked basic knowledge and scientific technology for building small-scale water conservancy projects. In order to solve the difficulties of a wide front and few technicians in this winter's small-scale farmland water conservancy construction, Wuhua County, according to the instructions of the province, selected more than 120 people from areas with conditions for developing water conservancy in September and October, including district production assistants, village cadres, water conservancy labor models, experienced veteran farmers, and peasant activists for training. The training process is divided into three stages. The first stage is to visit good and bad mountain pond projects, and the township cadres responsible for planning and building mountain ponds will make typical reports on the construction process, to solve how to determine the slope of the earth dam and the spillway, how to make the water outlet culvert, and find out the reasons why the mountain pond was washed away, so that students can initially understand the general knowledge of mountain ponds. The second stage mainly focuses on the three major principles of mountain pond engineering (applicable, durable, economical) and the four key points (pond base, earth dam, water outlet culvert, spillway) for on-site practice and explanation, so that students understand how to repair, consolidate and expand the original mountain pond project. Finally, the discussion covers issues such as organizational leadership, reasonable burden, and project management and maintenance in the construction project. At the end, the work was summarized and arranged, requiring them to fully apply the technology and knowledge they have learned to this winter's small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and continue to cultivate and improve other farmers.

    广东五华县组织农民学习兴修水利技术
    广东省五华县利用农闲开办训练班，组织农民学习兴修小型农田水利工程的知识和技术。五华县在去冬今春共动员了五十多万人工，恢复和修建了包括小型水库二百九十余座在内的小型农田水利工程三千四百多处。但在今年夏旱时，很多工程却没有起作用。经检查后，发现所做工程中普遍存在着以下几个缺点：一、山塘水库的土坝坝身都很单薄，边坡又陡，筑坝时没有注意夯实，很多工程都漏水；二、筑坝时对基地上的淤泥、草根、树枝等没有清除，新旧土结合得不紧密，坝基不稳固；三、溢洪道普遍不够宽，不够深，洪水容易漫过坝顶，有的山塘还没有溢洪道；四、不少山塘没有做卧管或竖管，或者放水涵洞开关困难；五、绝大部分水坡没有做护岸，两岸受水力冲刷，发生裂缝。大水坡下面没有做砌石护垣，坡脚常被水冲成深潭，坡身悬空，容易渗漏和崩塌。检查产生这些缺陷的原因，主要是农民缺乏兴修小型水利的基本知识和科学技术。为了解决今冬兴修小型农田水利中面宽、技术人员少的困难，五华县根据省里的指示，在九、十月间从有发展水利条件的地区挑选了包括区生产助理员、乡村干部、水利劳动模范、有经验的老农及农民积极分子等一百二十余人进行训练。学习进程共分三个阶段，第一阶段是参观好坏山塘工程，并由负责计划兴建山塘的乡干部作施工过程的典型报告，解决怎样定土坝的边坡和溢洪道，怎样做放水涵洞，并找出山塘被冲坏的原因，使学员初步明确山塘的一般知识。第二阶段主要是抓住山塘工程的三大原则（适用、耐用、经济），四个关键（塘基、土坝、放水涵管、溢洪道）去实地实习讲解，使学员懂得怎样去修补、巩固和扩大原有的山塘工程。最后是讨论兴建工程中的组织领导、合理负担和工程的管理养护等问题。结束时并总结和布置了工作，要求他们把所学到的技术和知识充分运用在今冬的小型农田水利工程中，并继续培养和提高其他农民。　　　　　（徐衍绶）
