Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th. The explanation work was still not carried out on the 13th, marking the 19th day of its suspension. Thirty days have passed since the explanation work began. Excluding four Sundays and the Indian Festival of Lights on the 7th, the time allocated to the Korean-Chinese side for conducting explanations was twenty-five days, totaling two hundred hours. However, due to the US side's instruction of special agent sabotage, the Korean-Chinese side was only able to conduct explanation work on six days, for less than forty hours, with no explanation taking place for nineteen days at all. If we add the twenty days that the start of the explanation was delayed due to the US side's delaying the construction of explanation facilities, the explanation work has been delayed by the US side for a total of thirty-nine days.

The repeated suspension of the explanation work is caused by the US side directing special agents to obstruct prisoners of war from listening to the explanations. Since the start of the explanation work, it has been interrupted four times. These interruptions occurred on October 16th, October 19th to 30th, November 2nd, and from November 6th to the present. The first three times were due to Syngman Rhee's special agents in the camp preventing captured Korean People's Army personnel from leaving the camp. Following US instructions, they delayed the explanation, intensified intimidation of prisoners of war in the POW camps, adjusted their organization, and further strengthened their control over the prisoners of war, preparing to sabotage the explanation work. The most recent interruption was caused by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Camp 22 similarly adopting the method of prohibiting prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanations. Initially, they used the excuse that some people in this camp had already listened to the explanation. Later, coordinating with the US propaganda, they also clamored for restricting the explanation time and completing the explanation for an entire camp in one day. According to a dispatch from Seoul on the 12th by the Kuomintang bandit news agency, these Chiang Kai-shek special agents even drafted a letter to "present" to US Vice President Nixon, who is currently in Seoul, demanding the restriction of explanation time. The consistent coordination between the actions and statements of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and the US side is further proof of the US side instructing special agents to sabotage the explanation work.

The US side's instruction of special agents to carry out the aforementioned obstructions and sabotage is aimed at making the explanation work "collapse" in order to forcibly detain Korean-Chinese prisoners of war.

### 美方指使特务继续阻挠  十三日解释工作仍未进行

    美方指使特务继续阻挠
    十三日解释工作仍未进行
    【新华社开城十三日电】十三日解释工作仍旧没有进行，这是解释工作停顿的第十九个日子。从解释工作开始以来已经过了三十天，除去四个星期日和七日印度千灯节，朝中方面应进行解释的时间是二十五天，共二百个小时。但由于美方指使特务分子破坏，朝中方面仅能在六天中进行解释工作，时间不足四十小时，有十九天根本没有解释。如果加上由于美方拖延修建解释设备而推迟了解释开始时间的二十天，解释工作被美方拖延了整整三十九天。
    解释工作一再停顿，是美方指挥特务阻挠战俘听取解释所造成的。从解释工作开始以来，已经被四次中断。这就是十月十六日、十月十九日到三十日、十一月二日、十一月六日到现在。前三次都是营场中的李承晚特务不准朝鲜人民军被俘人员走出营场。他们按照美方的指示拖延解释，在战俘营中加紧恫吓战俘，调整组织，更加强对战俘的控制，进行破坏解释工作的准备。最近一次的中断，是由于第二十二号营场的蒋介石特务同样采取禁止战俘出来听取解释的办法所造成的。他们起初藉口这个营场里已经有一部分人听过解释。后来，配合着美方的宣传步调，也叫嚣什么必须限制解释时间、必须一天解释完一整个营场。据国民党匪帮通讯社十二日从汉城发出的消息透露，这些蒋介石特务还拟定书信一件，“呈送”给正在汉城活动的美国副总统尼克松，叫喊要求限制解释时间。蒋介石特务和美方行动言论的配合一致，是美方指使特务破坏解释工作的又一证明。
    美方指使特务进行前述种种阻挠破坏活动，目的就在于使解释工作“垮台”，以便强迫扣留朝中战俘。
