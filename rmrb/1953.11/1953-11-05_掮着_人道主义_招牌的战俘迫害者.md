Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. Our correspondent Wu Min reports: The U.S. side's unreasonable obstruction and restriction of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives' visits to its prisoner-of-war camps has been further confirmed by the judgments made by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the investigation reports of the three mobile neutral nations inspection teams, which were released today. This behavior of the U.S. side is in sharp contrast to its current demand to send special agents to "inspect" the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial compounds.

The judgments of the Czechoslovak and Polish members show that the U.S. side was very afraid of the prisoners of war seeing the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives and tried every means to obstruct and restrict the representatives' visits to the prisoner-of-war camps. The U.S. side arbitrarily prohibited our representatives from freely contacting and talking with the prisoners of war and groundlessly stipulated that at least fifty prisoners of war should be present in each batch when the representatives talked with the prisoners of war, and that the representatives' talks with the prisoners of war should be reviewed by the U.S. side in advance. Even under these conditions for meeting the prisoners of war, the U.S. side deliberately reduced the time and frequency of the meetings, and some of the prisoners of war who were met were designated by the U.S. side. The U.S. side also used various excuses to prohibit our representatives from distributing gifts and reading out letters of condolence to the prisoners of war, and prohibited them from inspecting the facilities of the camps when there were prisoners of war in the camps, and even beat our representatives, using force to make them leave the camps and stop working.

However, since the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. side has put on a hypocritical face of concern for the prisoners of war, even posing as the "protecting power" of the prisoners of war, and repeatedly demanded that they be allowed to "inspect" all the activities of the Neutral Nations custodial compounds, regardless of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's refutation. The U.S. side's two diametrically opposed attitudes are obviously aimed at maintaining the special agents' reign of terror over the prisoners of war in order to realize their sinister plot to forcibly detain the prisoners of war. The reason why the U.S. side obstructed and restricted our Red Cross representatives from visiting the prisoner-of-war camps was because they were afraid that the representatives would discover the reign of terror carried out by the special agents against the prisoners of war, and also because they were afraid that the prisoners of war would expose to the representatives the fact that the special agents used violence to prevent them from demanding repatriation. And now the reason why the U.S. side is demanding to "inspect" the Neutral Nations custodial compounds is to send special agents to the camps to direct the Li and Chiang agents to strengthen the reign of terror and more frantically sabotage the explanatory work. From these two attitudes of the U.S. side, people can clearly see the ugly face of the prisoner-of-war persecutors hanging the "humanitarianism" signboard.

    掮着“人道主义”招牌的战俘迫害者
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方无理阻挠和限制朝中红十字会代表访问其战俘营的行为，从今天公布的中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员对三个机动中立国视察小组的调查报告所作的判语得到进一步证实。美方这种行为，与现在要求派遣特务分子“视察”中立国遣返委员会看管营场的行为，恰成一个鲜明的对照。
    捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员的判语表明，美方十分害怕战俘见到朝中红十字会代表，想尽办法阻挠和限制代表们访问战俘营。美方专横地禁止我方代表与战俘自由接触和谈话，毫无道理地规定：代表与战俘谈话时，每批战俘至少五十人，而且代表对战俘的谈话事先要经过美方的审查。即使在这种条件下会见战俘，美方还故意减少会见的时间和次数，有些被会见的战俘还是美方指定的。美方还用种种藉口禁止我方代表对战俘分发馈赠品和宣读慰问信，并且禁止他们在营场里有战俘的时候视察营场的设备，甚至殴打我方代表，用武力迫使他们离开营场，停止工作。
    但是自从战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，美方却又装出一副关心战俘的伪善脸孔，居然以战俘的“保护国”自居，不顾中立国遣返委员会的驳斥，一再要求允许他们“视察”中立国看管营场的全部活动。美方的这两种截然相反的态度，其目的显然都是在于要保持特务分子对战俘的恐怖统治，以便实现其强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋。美方所以阻挠和限制我方红十字会代表访问战俘营，就是因为害怕代表们发现特务分子对战俘施行的恐怖统治，也因为害怕战俘向代表们揭露特务用暴力阻止他们要求遣返的事实。而现在美方所以要求“视察”中立国看管营地，就是为了要派遣特务分子到营场里去，指挥李、蒋特务加强恐怖统治，更加疯狂地破坏解释工作。从美方这两种态度里，人们可以清楚地看到挂着“人道主义”招牌的战俘迫害者的丑恶嘴脸。
