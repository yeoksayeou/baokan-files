Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 17th: The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to prisoners of war was halted for the fifth time on the 17th. Because the U.S. side instructed special agents to frantically obstruct and sabotage the explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side failed to complete the planned explanation to prisoners of war in Camp 53 on the 16th, and only explained to a small portion of the prisoners of war originally planned. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) and the Indian Custodial Forces did not, in accordance with Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," segregate and guard the prisoners of war who had not yet listened to the explanation from those who had. Therefore, when the Korean-Chinese side notified the NNRC that it was scheduled to continue explaining to the prisoners of war in Camp 53 who had not yet listened on the 17th, the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces, under the obstruction of U.S. special agents, stated that they were unable to make arrangements.

General Li Sang-cho of our side had proposed conditions on the 14th to ensure the normal progress of the explanation work, namely, the control of the special agents over the prisoners of war must be thoroughly eliminated, any behavior of the special agents obstructing the explanation work must be strictly prohibited, U.S. personnel must be strictly prohibited from disturbing and interrupting the explanation work, and the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNRC's subsidiary bodies must stop interrupting the explanation work without authorization. However, during the explanation process on the 16th, the behavior of special agents sabotaging the explanation work became increasingly rampant. In addition to making loud noises in the explanation tents and arbitrarily insulting our explanation representatives, the special agents repeatedly attacked and injured our explanation representatives with sharp knives, iron blocks, stones, disinfectant powder, and chili powder. Up to thirty special agents have been arrested by Indian troops for committing violence. Our repatriated and returned captured personnel have repeatedly revealed that special agents brought a large number of weapons into the camp and intensified the manufacturing of various weapons in the camp, preparing to attack and injure the explanation representatives. Before and after the start of the explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side repeatedly proposed that the prisoners of war brought to the explanation site should be thoroughly searched. Now, special agents openly bring various weapons into the explanation tents to commit violence, so that the safety of the explanation representatives is not guaranteed, which is obviously inconsistent with the provisions of Article 20 of the "Terms of Reference of the NNRC." This article stipulates that the safety of the explanation representatives "within the actual boundaries of the prisoner of war custody site shall be the responsibility of the NNRC."

Due to the disruption and sabotage of special agents, and the obstruction and interruption of the explanation work by the U.S. "representatives," "translators," and Swiss and Swedish representatives from subsidiary bodies, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work on the 16th failed to proceed according to the scheduled plan and speed. According to the final count, only 228 prisoners of war listened to the explanation (30 of whom were arrested for committing violence, and 8 of whom had not yet completed the explanation, so only 190 prisoners of war had completed the explanation). The total time prisoners of war spent in the tents was 200 hours and 47 minutes. The average time each prisoner of war stayed was just over 52 minutes. However, the time wasted by disruptions and obstructions totaled 48 hours and 13 minutes, so the actual explanation time was 152 hours and 34 minutes. The average time each prisoner of war listened to the explanation was only 40 minutes. Some prisoners of war actually listened to the explanation for even less time. For example, Tent 18 explained to a total of seven prisoners of war. The total time prisoners of war stayed in the tent was 5 hours and 30 minutes, an average of 47 minutes per prisoner of war. The time taken up by the interruption of explanations caused by the noises of special agents and prisoners of war coerced by special agents was 1 hour and 3 minutes. The time taken up by the U.S. "representatives" and "translators" interrupting the explanation was 22 minutes, totaling 1 hour and 25 minutes. The actual explanation time was 4 hours and 5 minutes, with each prisoner of war listening to the explanation for an average of only 35 minutes. Under these circumstances, it was naturally impossible for the Korean-Chinese side to complete the explanation work for 500 prisoners of war in one camp in one day.

Facts show that it is not that the Korean-Chinese side is taking a long time to explain, but that the obstruction and sabotage activities of the U.S. special agents and U.S. "representatives" make it impossible for our side to complete its daily explanation work to the prisoners of war according to plan. This proves that if the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces do not immediately take measures to punish and eliminate the special agents and do not stop the obstruction and sabotage activities of the U.S. "representatives," the explanation work cannot proceed smoothly at all.

The U.S. side has not yet begun to explain to the U.S., British, and South Korean prisoners of war in the northern part of the demilitarized zone, in order to concentrate its efforts on sabotaging the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side.

### 我方十七日解释工作因特务阻挠又告停顿

    我方十七日解释工作因特务阻挠又告停顿
    【新华社开城十七日电】十七日朝中方面对战俘的解释工作第五次陷于停顿。由于美方指使特务疯狂阻挠和破坏解释工作，朝中方面在十六日未能完成对第五十三号营场的战俘进行解释的计划，仅对原计划中的少数一部分战俘进行了解释。但是中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队又未按照“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定，把未及听取解释的战俘与已经听取解释的战俘隔离看管。因此，当朝中方面通知中立国遣返委员会定于十七日继续向第五十三号营场未听解释的战俘进行解释时，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在美方特务的阻挠下，表示无法进行安排。
    我方李相朝将军在十四日曾提出保证解释工作正常进行的条件，即必须彻底清除特务对战俘的控制，严禁特务任何阻挠解释工作的行为，严禁美方人员扰乱并中断解释工作，和终止中立国遣返委员会附属机构中的瑞士和瑞典委员擅自中断解释工作。但在十六日解释过程中，特务分子破坏解释工作的行为竟越来越猖狂。特务们除掉在解释帐篷里大吵大闹，任意侮辱我方解释代表外，竟多次用尖刀、铁块、石头、消毒粉和辣椒面等袭击和伤害我方解释代表。因为行凶而被印度部队拘捕的特务分子达三十人。遣返归来的我方被俘人员一再揭露：特务分子把大批凶器带进营场，并且在营场里加紧制造各种凶器，准备袭击和伤害解释代表。在解释工作开始前后，朝中方面也曾一再提出应将带至解释场所的战俘予以彻底搜查。现在特务们公然将各种凶器带进解释帐篷行凶，以致解释代表的安全没有保证，这显然是与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第二十款的规定不符的。该款规定：解释代表“在战俘看管地点实际界限内的安全，由中立国遣返委员会负责”。
    由于特务分子的捣乱和破坏，与美方“代表”、 “翻译”及附属机构中瑞士、瑞典代表阻挠和中断解释工作，十六日朝中方面的解释工作未能按照预定的计划与速度进行。据最后清查，听取解释的战俘仅有二百二十八名（其中有三十名因行凶被拘捕，八名尚未完成解释，所以，已完成解释的战俘仅一百九十名）。战俘在帐篷中停留的时间一共是二百小时又四十七分钟。每个战俘平均停留时间为五十二分钟强。但是，被捣乱和阻挠所浪费的时间一共是四十八小时又十三分钟，所以实际进行解释的时间为一百五十二小时又三十四分钟。每个战俘平均听取解释的时间仅四十分钟。一部分战俘实际上听取解释的时间还没有这么久。例如，第十八号解释帐篷一共向七个战俘进行解释，战俘停留在帐篷里的时间一共是五小时又三十分钟，每个战俘平均四十七分钟。特务分子以及受特务胁迫的战俘的吵闹使解释中断所占去的时间共一小时又三分钟。美方“代表”及“翻译”中断解释占去时间共二十二分钟，合计一小时又二十五分钟，实际进行解释的时间共四小时又五分钟，每个战俘平均仅听取解释三十五分钟。在这种情况下，朝中方面自然无法在一天内完成对一个营场的五百名战俘的解释工作。
    事实表明：并不是朝中方面进行解释的时间很长，而是美方特务和美方“代表”的阻挠和破坏活动，使得我方不能按照计划，完成其每日对战俘的解释工作。这就证明：中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不立即采取措施惩办并清除特务分子，不制止美方“代表”的阻挠和破坏活动，解释工作根本无法顺利进行。
    美方至今仍未开始对非军事区北部的美、英及南朝鲜籍战俘进行解释，以便集中力量破坏朝中方面的解释工作。
