Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 26th. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) handed over to the Korean-Chinese side on November 25th a copy of the secret instructions intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces on November 8th from U.S. side’s agents infiltrated into the NNRC camp, regarding the sabotage of explanatory work. This secret instruction further proves the criminal actions of the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek sides in directly commanding the Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the NNRC camps to sabotage explanatory work and forcibly detain prisoners of war.

These secret instructions were found by the Indian Custodial Forces on the person of Rhee bandit agent, Li Heng-soo, who attempted to sneak into the 40th camp of the NNRC. Li Heng-soo was dispatched by the "12th Detachment Headquarters," a special agent organ of Syngman Rhee in Seoul, to sneak into the NNRC camp to deliver these secret instructions to Han Yin-song, the Rhee bandit agent leader of the 40th camp's "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" branch's "Deputy Leader" and "Group Leader" of the 40th camp's "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," and Rhee bandit agent "Battalion Commander" Chi Ji-zhe. (According to disclosures by our captured personnel: Han Yin-song had secretly gone to Seoul with nine other Rhee bandit agents in early October to receive "instructions" on sabotaging the explanatory work.) The person who signed these secret instructions was Park Dong-hyuk, a Rhee bandit agent leader. According to a notice from the Indian Custodial Forces, Park Dong-hyuk had originally infiltrated the NNRC camp to direct the sabotage of the explanatory work, and secretly went to Seoul with another Rhee bandit agent leader, Han Bing-tae, on the night of October 9th.

The full text of the Chinese translation of the U.S. side's secret instructions to the special agents, written in Korean, is as follows: (Subheadings added by the editor)

    Special Agents Enter and Exit Camps to Convey Three Orders from Syngman Rhee and Won Yong-duk

    To Han Yin-song, Chi Ji-zhe, and all committee members:

    To comrades Han, Chi, and all committee members, led by the Chief of Security and the Chief of Organization: You are working so hard, I don't know what adjective to use to express my respect. After I arrived in Seoul, I visited the highest-level important cadres, and after receiving the order from the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie to "begin the work of the Anti-Communist Youth," I set off for Munsan. However, due to the difficulty of crossing the Imjin River, I returned to Seoul and went to the 12th Detachment Headquarters for the first time, and decided to continue working here in the future. We greeted the two comrades who broke through the death line and returned alive with blood and tears. Regarding the matter of going to the 12th Detachment Headquarters, I had submitted a blood letter to you and also contacted you in writing through × last time, but it may have been due to the negligence of the liaison officer that it failed to reach the 40th camp, please forgive me. As the two comrades who crossed the camp and returned the other day said, and as seen in the letter from the leader, regarding the explanation issue and the release issue, I will now explain the intentions according to the instructions of the government leader, President Syngman Rhee, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie, who is specifically in charge of the anti-communist youth cause.

    Refuse to Listen to Explanations

    1.  The Government of the Republic of Korea has requested the United Nations to release the anti-communist youth, but it has not been realized due to the influence of the delicate international situation. Since you consider the Republic of Korea to be your motherland, why should you be subjected to explanations from the communist side as a citizen? You should not listen to explanations.

    Syngman Rhee Wants to Seize Prisoners of War by Force

    2.  Not listening to explanations will absolutely not extend the time limit stipulated by the Prisoner of War Agreement. If the time limit is extended, the Republic of Korea is ready to mobilize national power to release the anti-communist youth.

    There Will Be Neutral Countries Cooperating

    3.  Only if the anti-communist youth do not listen to explanations will the opportunity for the Government of the Republic of Korea to mobilize national power arrive quickly. If the pro-communist Indian troops use force to force the anti-communist youth to listen to explanations, this is a violation of the agreement. Therefore, Switzerland and Sweden have also announced that they will withdraw. The Republic of Korea will also seize the conditions to release the prisoners of war, so that it can also maintain the dignity of democratic countries. Therefore, opposing listening to explanations is beneficial to the anti-communist youth.

Although written in an explanatory way, the above is the order of the government, President Lee, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie, who directly executes it.

     Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Agency in Korea's Order

    The instructions to the Chinese anti-communist youth should be the same as the instructions to the Koreans. Chi Ji-zhe should be responsible for conveying this, but when conveying it, he should say that this is the order of the Chinese Embassy in Korea.

    Won Yong-duk Instructs to Strengthen Special Agent Organizations

    The Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie's instructions on unifying and reorganizing the anti-communist youth in the camp: The youth group name for the Korean anti-communist patriotic youth in Rainan Village (Editor's note: According to other special agent documents, Rainan Village should be Yunnan Village, and the Rhee bandit gang called Dongchang-ri Yunnan Village.) should be named the Rainan Village Anti-Communist Youth Corps. The leader is in the Gendarmerie Headquarters; there is a deputy leader in Geoje-ri, Nonsan (Editor's note: Here the special agent is probably referring to the prisoner of war camps relocated from Geoje-ri and Nonsan.), and the hospital; Geoje-ri is the area for the first deputy leader, Nonsan is the area for the second deputy leader, and the hospital is the area for the third deputy leader.

    The first deputy leader is Han Yin-song, the second deputy leader will be decided by Han Yin-song and then passed, and the third deputy leader is Kim Seong-rok. The above is the order of the Commander-in-Chief. The committee members are the leaders, deputy leaders, and battalion commanders of each camp. If this order is violated and individual heroic actions are taken, they will be subject to legal sanctions.

    Won Yong-duk is Responsible for Killing Prisoners of War Who Wish to be Repatriated

    If possible, those who disobey orders can be purged internally, and the responsibility will be borne by the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie. However, doing so will give the Indians the opportunity to commit atrocities in the camp, so it is best to educate and control them as much as possible. However, only in the 40th branch must those who wish to return to the north be killed, because this will reveal secrets; but in other camps, a tolerant policy should be adopted. The 40th leader can be personally selected and decided by the second deputy leader, but should be selected from the camp with a radio.

    Code for Radio Communication

    Leader, please tell the second deputy leader the code for receiving radio reports, so that even if there is no 12th Detachment Headquarters in the future, you can also listen to the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie by radio. Now use the code issued to the leader on the morning of November 9th after the news time and after the evening news time, send it once in the morning and twice in the evening. If necessary for work, a Chinese anti-communist youth representative can be called to serve as the fourth deputy leader.

    Take Advantage of the Fact That Indian Troops Said They Cannot Use Force

    After receiving this letter, before carrying out the most important demonstration against explanation of President Lee's order, please pass this order at the representative meeting of each camp as soon as possible, and carry out anti-explanation demonstrations and submit protests under a certain time and certain slogans. The Indian army has also said that they cannot use force against Korean anti-communist youth. If force is used, the ROK military will attack. Therefore, please be politically vigilant. I am sending you the proclamations of President Lee and the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie at the same time, please read them carefully. I wanted to be more formal, but to prevent accidents and because of secret work, it naturally turned out like this.

    Code Broadcasts Won Yong-duk's Orders, Hospital is a Contact Station

    Leader, did you listen to the code broadcast issued by the 40th branch leader during the morning broadcasts on November 5th, 6th, and 7th? Future communication will use broadcasts and Kim Seong-rok in the hospital to send to the first and second deputy leaders. The sender's name should be "Rainan Village Anti-Communist Youth Corps Central Headquarters sender ×××". If you receive such a letter, it should be understood that this is the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie.

    Syngman Rhee Orders Forcing Chinese and North Korean Prisoners of War to Write Letters to Himself and Wang Dong-yuan

    This time, Comrade Li, who was sent to the camp, should try to make him cross the camp when he has fully completed his work. At that time, he should send letters to the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie and President Lee, and letters from the Chinese to the embassy, in order to show the world that the people of Korea and China are fighting unitedly. Especially because the struggle of the Anti-Communist Youth in Rainan Village is a struggle to declare the righteousness of the Korean nation to the world, therefore, even if there are difficulties and insufficient communication in the struggle, I hope to fight to the end against the explanation. You should understand that the above is President Lee's unquestionable order and execute it diligently. Sometimes, the first deputy leader mentioned above is also called the East Deputy Leader, and the second (deputy leader) is also called the West Deputy Leader. Han is unable to come because he is sick at the General Headquarters in Seoul.

    Demonstrations, Singing, Burning Fires, and Waving Flags are Contact Signals

    Please frequently inform the results of the work according to the following signals, and I will report them to the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie accordingly. 1. When Comrade Li arrives safely, please conduct demonstrations and singing from 11:00 to 12:00 in the morning and from 1:30 to 2:30 in the afternoon. We will consider that he has arrived safely.

    2.  Signal for holding a representative meeting: When raising the national flag at 11:00 in the morning, please burn a pile of fire below and sing the Anti-Communist Youth Corps song.

    3.  When the order to resolutely oppose explanation is conveyed at the representative meeting, please burn two piles of fire in front of the place where the national flag is raised at 11:00 in the morning and 4:00 in the afternoon, and sing "Fight the Communists Song".

    4.  After listening to the radio order, wave the Taegeukgi alone in the dining hall at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning.

When I receive the signal, I will burn a pile of fire.

    "Absolutely Keep it Secret"

    The above-mentioned situation is an extremely secret matter that only a few people know about even within the Government of the Republic of Korea, and it must be kept absolutely secret.

    I wish the leader, deputy leaders, and everyone good at fighting!

                No. 1, November 7th Park Dong-hyuk

### 印度看管部队  截获李承晚特务携带的秘密指示  转达李承晚、元容德破坏解释工作的命令

    印度看管部队
    截获李承晚特务携带的秘密指示
    转达李承晚、元容德破坏解释工作的命令
   【新华社开城二十六日电】中立国遣返委员会已在十一月二十五日把印度看管部队在十一月八日截获的美方给混在中立国看管营场内的特务分子的破坏解释工作的秘密指令的副本交给朝中方面。这件秘密指令进一步证明美、李、蒋方面直接指挥中立国看管营场内的李、蒋特务分子进行破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行动。
    这件秘密指令是印度看管部队从企图潜入中立国看管营地第四十号营场的李匪特务李亨洙的身上搜获的。李亨洙由在汉城的李承晚的特务机关“第十二中队本部”派遣潜入中立国看管营场把这件秘密指令交给第四十号营场的李匪特务头子东场里“反共青年团”支部“副团长”兼第四十号营场“反共青年团”“组长”韩银松，和李匪特务“大队长”池基哲。（据我方被俘人员揭露：韩银松曾在十月初与另外九个李匪特务潜往汉城领受破坏解释工作的“指示”。）签署这件秘密指令的是李匪特务头子朴东赫。据印度看管部队的通知，朴东赫原先也混在中立国看管营场内指挥破坏解释工作，在十月九日夜与另一个李匪特务头子韩秉泰潜往汉城。
    美方给特务分子的这件用朝鲜文写成的秘密指令的中文译文的全文如下：（小标题为编者所加）
    特务出入营场转达李承晚和元容德的三项命令
    韩银松、池基哲两位并致各委员：
    以韩、池两位和警备部长、组织部长为首的各委员同志们：你们为工作多么辛苦啊，我不知道用什么形容词来表示敬意。我抵汉城后访问了最高级的重要干部，由宪兵总司令官处接受“应开始反共青年的工作”的命令后，出发到汶山的中途由于碰到渡临津江的难题而转回汉城，初次到第十二中队本部，决定今后继续留在这里工作。我们以血泪迎接了突破死线九死一生地归来的两位同志。为了到第十二中队本部一事，我曾向阁下提出血书并在前次另外通过×以书面联络，但可能是由于联络员的疏忽而未能传到第四十号营场，请你原谅。如同前日越营归来的两位同志所说的，并在团长的信上所看到的，关于解释问题和释放问题，我现在要根据政府的领导者、国父李承晚总统阁下和专门担任反共青年事业的宪兵总司令官阁下的指示，说明其意图。
    要拒绝听解释
    一、大韩民国政府已要求联合国释放反共青年，但由于微妙的国际形势的影响而未实现。既然认为大韩民国是自己的祖国，作为一个国民来说为什么还受共方的解释呢？不应听解释。
    李承晚要以武力劫夺战俘
    二、不听解释也绝对不会延长根据战俘协定所规定的期限的。如果期限被延长，大韩民国已作好发动国力释放反共青年的准备。
    将有中立国配合行动
    三、只有反共青年不听解释，才会促进大韩民国政府发动国力的机会迅速到来。如果亲共的印度军人为迫使反共青年听解释而使用武力的话，这是违反协定的，因此瑞士、瑞典也已宣布过将退出。大韩民国也将抓住条件释放战俘，这样也可以维持民主国家的体面，因此反对听解释就对反共青年有利。
    虽然以解说的方式写了，但上述是政府和李总统阁下以及其直接执行者宪兵总司令官的命令。
      蒋匪驻韩代理机关的命令
    对中国反共青年的指示应与对韩国人的指示相同。池基哲氏应负责传达，但传达时应说这是中国驻韩大使馆的命令。
    元容德指示加强特务组织
    宪兵总司令官关于统一重新编制营场内反共青年的指示：雨南村（编者按：从其他特务文件来看，雨南村应为云南村，李匪帮称东场里为云南村。）韩国反共爱国青年的青年团名称，应定名为雨南村反共青年团。团长在宪兵总司令部内；在巨济里、论山（编者按：此处估计特务是指从巨济里、论山迁来的战俘营而言。）、病院各有一副团长；巨济里为第一副团长区域、论山为第二副团长区域、病院为第三副团长区域。
    第一副团长为韩银松、第二副团长由韩银松氏决定之后通过、第三副团长为金成禄，以上是总司令官的命令。委员由各营场的团长、副团长、大队长担任，如果违反此命令而采取个人英雄主义行动时，将受法律制裁。
    屠杀愿遣返的战俘，由元容德负责
    如有可能，可在内部肃清不服从命令的分子，而其责任将由宪兵总司令官来负，但这样做会给印度人在营场内进行暴行的机会，因此最好尽可能地进行教育并掌握。但是只在四十支部必须杀掉愿回北部的家伙，因为这会泄露秘密的缘故；但在其他营场应采取宽容政策。四十团长可由第二副团长个人选出并决定，但应从有收音机的营场内选出。
    密码无线电联系
    团长先生，请你将以收音机收报的密码告知第二副团长，以便将来没有第十二中队本部时也可以以收音机收听宪兵总司令官的命令。现在使用发给团长的密码于十一月九日早晨新闻时间后和晚上新闻时间之后发出，早晨发一次晚上发两次。如果工作上必要的话，可以叫一名中国反共青年代表来担任第四副团长。
    利用印军说过不能使用武力
    接到此信后，在进行最重要的——李总统命令的反对解释示威之前，请尽速在各营场代表会议上通过此项命令，并在一定时间、一定口号下进行反解释示威和提出抗议书。印度军也说过，对韩国反共青年不能使用武力，如果使用武力的话，大韩民国的国军将会进击，因此请在政治上提高警惕。现同时寄去李总统阁下和宪兵总司令官阁下的文告，请精读。原想讲究一些形式，但为防万一和由于作秘密工作的缘故，自然而然地就像这样地作了。
    密码广播元容德命令，医院是联络站
    团长，你收听了于十一月五日、六日、七日早晨广播时由四十支部团发出的密码广播没有？以后的联络将利用广播和在病院的金成禄发到第一、第二副团长处，发报名义要用“雨南村反共青年团中央团部发送人×××”。如果收到如此的信时应理解为这是宪兵总司令官的命令。
    李承晚命令强迫中朝战俘给他自己和王东原写信
    这次派往营场的李同志，当他完全完成工作时，应设法使他越营。那时应寄来致宪兵总司令官和李总统阁下的信和中国人致大使馆的信，以便向全世界人民显示韩、中两国人民统一地战斗的事实。特别是因为雨南村反共青年们的斗争是向全世界宣示韩国民族的正气的斗争，因此虽在斗争中有困难和联络不充分，希望为反对解释而斗争到底。应理会以上是不容分辩的李总统的命令，切切执行之。有时，上述的第一副团长亦叫作东副团长，第二（副团长）亦叫作西副团长。韩，因为现在在汉城总司令部生病而未能来到。
    示威、唱歌、烧火、打旗都是联络信号
    请按以下信号时常告知工作结果，据此将报告宪兵总司令官。一、李同志平安到达时，请在上午十一时至十二时和自下午一时三十分至二时半进行示威和唱歌，我们将认为平安到达。
    二、召开代表会议时的信号：上午十一时升国旗时，请在下边烧一簇火并唱反共青年团歌。
    三、在代表会议传达命令决定誓死反对解释时，请在升国旗处前面于上午十一时和下午四时烧两把火，并唱“打共歌”。
    四、收听无线电命令后，在上午八时或九时，单人在饭厅摇太极旗。
    当我收到信号时将烧一把火。
    “绝对保守秘密”
    以上所说的情况是在大韩民国政府内也只有少数人知道的极端秘密，应绝对保守秘密。
    祝正副团长和诸位善于战斗！
                第一号、十一月七日　朴东赫
