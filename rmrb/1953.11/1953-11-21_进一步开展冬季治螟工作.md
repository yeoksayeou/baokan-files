    Several major administrative regions and provinces in rice-growing areas have successively deployed this year's winter rice borer control work. The leadership departments in most areas are paying attention to this work this year, the deployment is timely, and the leadership is relatively specific. This will create good conditions for increasing rice production next year.
    After a year of practice, the method of winter rice borer control has proven to be effective. In areas where rice borer control was carried out last winter, rice borer damage has been significantly reduced this year, and the rice damage rate has been greatly reduced. For example, in Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, where rice roots were treated more thoroughly last year, the rate of white ears this year dropped from 5% last year to below 1%. Conversely, in Daibu District, Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, because the treatment of rice roots was poor, the white ear rate of rice this year is generally 15%, and in the most severe cases, it reaches 35%. These facts have made cadres and the masses more aware of the importance of winter rice borer control work. At the same time, areas where winter rice borer control was implemented last year have accumulated some experience in the organization, leadership, and technology of this work. These are all favorable conditions for further developing this work this year. All localities should summarize and apply last year's experience well.
    In the winter rice borer control work last winter, some shortcomings also occurred. These shortcomings were mainly caused by the lack of experience of cadres and the work style of coercion and commandism. When carrying out this work this year, all localities have paid attention to this issue and corrected the shortcomings of rigidly stipulating "tasks" for the masses last year, regardless of the region or the specific situation. When deploying winter rice borer control work, agricultural leadership departments in most areas have formulated different methods for treating rice roots based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, according to the differences in regions, rice varieties, and the severity of rice borer damage. In order to strengthen the leadership of this winter's rice borer control work, Hangxian County and other areas in Zhejiang Province also held an enlarged meeting of the county party committee and held agricultural technology training courses. This practice of learning from last year's lessons, correcting shortcomings, and strengthening leadership is worth advocating.
    This year, the planting area of milk vetch and alfalfa has increased in various rice-growing areas as green manure planting is being promoted. Therefore, the question of whether digging rice roots to control rice borers will hinder the growth of green manure plants should be properly resolved. Last year, some areas emphasized that digging rice roots would damage green manure plants, so they did not dig the rice roots in the fields planted with milk vetch, leaving a loophole in last year's winter rice borer control work. Some farmers simply did not plant green manure crops because they had to dig rice roots. Does digging rice roots hinder the growth of green manure crops? According to the existing experience in some areas, it basically does not hinder it. The Agricultural Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry learned in Zhenhai County that digging rice roots before milk vetch completely covers the field (i.e., before January in the Gregorian calendar) results in very little loss of milk vetch; digging when the field surface is dry results in less loss than digging when it is wet. As for the situation where green manure plants are frozen to death due to digging rice roots, it has not been found in Zhenhai. According to a survey in some areas of Jiangsu Province, digging rice roots in milk vetch fields only results in the loss of one-fortieth of the milk vetch. However, it should be noted that although digging rice roots will not damage green manure crops, trampling on green manure crops due to digging rice roots has occurred in all areas last year. According to the experience of many areas, the best way to solve this problem is to advocate "digging your own fields." When mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives dig rice roots, they must educate team members and cooperative members and check the quality of work.
    This winter, in addition to carrying out winter plowing, winter planting, building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and accumulating fertilizer, rice-producing areas must also deliver public grain, sell grain to the state, develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and conduct general elections. Therefore, when carrying out rice borer control work this year, it is even more necessary to arrange the labor force of the masses well so that various major tasks can cooperate with each other without hindering each other, and that other important work is not hindered due to treating rice roots to control rice borers, nor that rice borer control work is squeezed out due to carrying out other work.
    Rice is the largest of all food crops in our country in terms of planting area and total output. Rice borer is a serious pest in the southern rice-growing areas and a major enemy in our struggle to increase grain production. According to past experience, rice production is reduced by 20% to 30% in normal years due to the damage of this pest, and in severe cases, production is reduced by 70% to 80%, or even no harvest at all. We must expand the achievements of last winter's rice borer control and launch a further winter offensive against rice borers, and strive for a better rice harvest next year.

### 进一步开展冬季治螟工作

    进一步开展冬季治螟工作  
    近宇 
    种植水稻地区的几个大行政区和省的农业领导部门，已相继布置了今年冬季的治螟工作。大部地区的领导部门今年是重视这个工作的，布置得很及时，领导也比较具体。这将为明年的水稻增产创造一个良好的条件。
    冬季治螟的方法，经过一年实践，已经证明了确实是有效的。去年冬季治螟的地区，今年螟害显著减轻，水稻被害率大大降低。如江苏金坛县去年处理稻根作得比较彻底，今年的白穗率由去年的百分之五降到百分之一以下。相反的，江苏溧阳县戴埠区因处理稻根作得较差，今年水稻白穗一般是百分之十五，最多的到百分之三十五。这些事实使干部和群众都更明白了冬季治螟工作的重要性。同时，去年实行了冬季治螟的地区，在这个工作的组织领导上和技术上，都已经创造了一些经验。这些都是今年进一步开展这个工作的有利条件。各地应该很好地把去年的经验加以总结和运用。
    在去冬治螟工作中，也产生了一些缺点。这些缺点主要是由于干部缺乏经验和强迫命令的作风而产生的。今年各地在进行这个工作时，都注意了这个问题，纠正了去年不分地区、不看具体情况、对群众生硬规定“任务”的缺点。多数地区的农业领导部门在布置冬季治螟工作时，都根据因地制宜的原则，按照地区的不同、稻子的不同和螟虫危害的轻重，规定了不同的处理稻根的办法。浙江杭县等地区为了加强对今冬治螟工作的领导，还特别召开了县委扩大会议，举办了农业技术训练班。这种吸取去年教训、纠正缺点、加强领导的作法是值得提倡的。
    今年各水稻区在提倡多种绿肥的情况下，紫云英、苜蓿的播种面积增加了。因此，对于掘稻根治螟会不会妨碍绿肥植物的生长的问题，应很好地加以解决。去年有些地区强调掘稻根会损害绿肥植物，因而不掘种了紫云英的田中的稻根，给去年冬季治螟工作留下一个漏洞。有的农民因为要掘稻根，就索性不种绿肥作物。掘稻根究竟妨碍不妨碍绿肥作物的生长呢？据一些地区已有的经验，基本上是不妨碍的。浙江省农林厅农业处在镇海县了解，在紫云英没有长满田时（即公历一月份以前）掘稻根，损失紫云英很少；在田面干燥时掘，比湿润时掘损失的更少。至于因掘稻根而冻死绿肥植物的情况，在镇海没有发现。据江苏省部分地区的调查，在紫云英田里掘稻根，仅损失紫云英四十分之一。不过要注意的是：掘稻根虽然不会掘坏绿肥作物，但因掘稻根而踏坏绿肥作物则是去年各地都曾发生过的。根据许多地区的经验，解决这个问题的最好的办法就是提倡“自田自掘”。互助组和农业生产合作社掘稻根时，要对组员、社员进行教育，并对工作质量进行检查。
    今年冬季，水稻产区除了要进行冬耕、冬种、兴修小型农田水利、积肥等冬季生产之外，还要送公粮、出售粮食给国家，还要发展互助合作组织，还要进行普选。因此，今年进行治螟工作时更要很好地安排群众的劳动力，使各种主要工作能够互相配合而不要互相妨碍，不要因处理稻根治螟而妨碍其它重要工作，也不要因进行其它工作而挤掉了治螟工作。
    水稻在我国各种食粮作物中就种植面积和总产量来说都是最大的。螟虫则是南方水稻区为害严重的害虫，是我们为增产粮食而斗争中的一个大敌。根据历年的经验，由于这种害虫为害，一般年份水稻减产二三成，严重时减产七八成，甚至颗粒无收。我们必须扩大去冬治螟的战果，对螟虫进一步开展冬季攻势，为明年水稻更好的丰收而斗争。
