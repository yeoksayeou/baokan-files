Shandong peanuts, which have the highest output in the country, have now been harvested, and farmers are drying and cleaning high-quality peanuts and peanut kernels to sell to the state. According to statistics from a few days in mid-November, state-owned oil systems and cooperatives across the province can purchase an average of approximately four million jin of peanut kernels per day. In the six key market towns of Xindian and Taocun in the Laiyang Special District, 330,000 jin of peanuts are on the market daily. Due to reasonable purchase prices and strengthened market management, state purchases account for more than 90% of the peanuts on the market in various regions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东花生大量上市
    各地合作社已全面开展收购
    产量居全国第一位的山东落花生现在已收刨完毕，农民们正把品质优良的花生、花生仁晒干拣净售给国家。据十一月中旬几天的统计，全省国营油脂系统和合作社平均每天可收进花生仁四百万斤左右。莱阳专区辛店、陶村等六个重点集镇每天有三十三万斤花生上市。由于收购价格的合理和市场管理的加强，国家收购比重已占到各地花生上市量的百分之九十以上。　　　　（新华社）
