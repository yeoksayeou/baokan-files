Title: Dean's Tactics of Delay

Just as U.S. representative Dean predicted further "delays" in the Panmunjom talks, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference in Washington on November 3rd, publicly supported the delaying tactics Dean was employing at the negotiating table, praising Dean for "displaying great skill, ingenuity, and patience" at the Panmunjom talks. Dulles and his old partner from a New York law firm, Dean, acting in concert, brought even more ominous portents to the talks.

Let us see what "skill, ingenuity, and patience" Dean has displayed at the Panmunjom talks!

The task of these talks is to resolve how the political conference should be convened. Everyone would consider this an important conference, but Dean adopted a frivolous attitude towards the conference from the start. He had no intention of drafting an agenda for the conference at all, but only wanted to discuss the time and place of the political conference and then hastily conclude the talks. Later, because our side proposed five items for the agenda, Dean reluctantly put together a four-item agenda as a perfunctory response. However, the agenda did not include discussing the issue of the political conference's members, which our side had repeatedly emphasized as the first issue to be discussed in our reply to the U.S. prior to the talks. Even the U.S. government's notification had indicated agreement to discuss this issue. Then, Dean began to make unreasonable demands in the talks, launching rude attacks and insults against the Korean and Chinese side. After Dean's gangster tactics were righteously and sternly rebuked by our side, he suddenly changed his tune, pretending to be very willing to discuss the issues, and began to propose the so-called U.S. "new proposals." From October 29th to the 4th of this month, Dean proposed six so-called "new proposals" one after another. We searched through these six "new proposals" but could not find any new content. All these new proposals had only one purpose: to try every trick to refuse to discuss the issue of the members of the political conference.

Everyone knows that the reason our side firmly insists that the talks should discuss the issue of the conference members is because our side has consistently advocated that neutral countries, especially Asian neutral countries, must participate in the political conference. The task of the political conference is to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the Korean issue is related to Asian and world peace. It is completely unreasonable to discuss such a major issue without allowing neutral countries, especially Asian neutral countries, to participate. Apart from a small handful of warmongers like Dulles and Dean, it would be difficult to find the fallacy of opposing the participation of neutral countries in the political conference anywhere in the world. Even the U.S.'s closest "ally," the British Ambassador to the U.S., Makins, admitted on the 2nd of this month that India's participation in the political conference would "play a beneficial role." As for why our side firmly insists that the talks should first discuss the issue of membership, it is also not difficult to understand. Because before the question of who will participate in the conference is resolved, it is ridiculous to discuss how to raise funds for the conference and how to arrange the conference facilities. What else can this explain other than that it is intended to make trouble or deliberately delay? And Dean's so-called "new proposals" contain similar ridiculous proposals.

Why is the U.S. so afraid of discussing the issue of political conference membership? This proves that the U.S. is afraid of expanding the members of the political conference and afraid of the participation of neutral countries. Because if the members of the political conference are expanded and neutral countries participate, the U.S.'s position in the political conference will become more isolated, the U.S.'s conspiracy to undermine the political conference will be more exposed, and the U.S.'s dictatorial behavior at the conference will encounter greater difficulties. Therefore, it will be difficult for the U.S. to achieve its conspiracy plan to undermine the political conference. People still remember that a reporter from the U.S. "New York Post" said a long time ago when talking about why the U.S. opposed the participation of neutral countries in the political conference: "Because the United States wants to act arbitrarily in the political conference in the same way it did in the recent UN General Assembly." The reporter also admitted: "Reliable diplomatic sources say that the United States not only hopes to exclude India from the political conference, but is even trying to use a method to prevent Britain, France, and other countries that supply troops to the unified command from having a real say in the conference."

The problem is very clear. The reason why the U.S. opposes discussing the issue of the political conference members is also to oppose the participation of all neutral countries in the political conference, so that the U.S. can manipulate the political conference in the same way it manipulates the United Nations, so that the U.S. can undermine the authority of the political conference in the same way it undermines the true authority of the United Nations, and finally, it will be easier for the U.S. to prevent the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and prevent the easing of international tensions. In order to achieve such a despicable goal, the U.S. does not hesitate to adopt all rogue tactics. Therefore, Dean is playing his so-called "skills" and "ingenuity" in delaying the talks on a large scale.

The Panmunjom talks have been going on for almost two weeks, and the issue of the conference agenda has not been reasonably resolved. U.S. representative Dean is continuing to use his "skill, ingenuity, and patience" to implement the plan of a small number of warmongers to delay the talks. According to the United Press, a person close to Dean said: If the talks continue for another week without results, "it will even continue for several months."

The facts are very obvious. Without progress in the Panmunjom talks, the political conference cannot be convened. The responsibility lies entirely with the U.S. side, with warmongers like Dulles and Dean in the United States.

    迪安的拖延战术
    微言
    正当美方代表迪安在板门店会谈中预言会谈“将进一步拖延”时，美国国务卿杜勒斯十一月三日在华盛顿的记者招待会上发表谈话，公开支持迪安在会议桌上玩弄的拖延战术。称赞迪安在板门店会谈中，“表现了很大的技巧、机智和耐性”。杜勒斯和他当年在纽约一家律师事务所里的老伙伴迪安的一唱一和，给会谈带来了更加不祥的征兆。
    让我们看看迪安在板门店会谈中表现的“技巧、机智和耐性”是些什么吧！
    这次会谈的任务是解决政治会议应该如何召开的问题，人人都会认为这是一个重要的会议，可是迪安却一开始就对会议采取了一种儿戏的态度，他根本没打算要拟定什么会议的议程，只想把政治会议的时间和地点讨论一下就草草收场，以后由于我方提出了会谈的五项议程，迪安才勉强凑出了一个四项议程的方案来搪塞，可是在方案中根本没有提出讨论政治会议成员问题的议程，而这项议程是我方在会谈以前答复美方的通知中一再强调过必须首先讨论的，连美国政府的通知中都表示同意讨论这个问题的。接着，迪安就在会谈中无理取闹起来，对朝中方面进行蛮横的攻击和谩骂，迪安这种流氓手段遭到我方义正辞严的斥责以后，他突然又变了腔调，装出一付很愿意讨论问题的样子，开始提出了美国的所谓“新方案”。从十月二十九日到本月四日一周之间，迪安接二连三地提了六个所谓“新方案”，我们翻遍这六个“新方案”，却找不到一点新内容，所有这些新方案，只有一个目的，就是企图变尽一切花样来拒绝讨论政治会议的成员问题。
    大家知道，我方所以坚决主张会谈应该讨论会议的成员问题，就是因为我方一贯主张政治会议必须有中立国家的参加，特别是亚洲中立国家的参加。政治会议的任务是和平解决朝鲜问题，而朝鲜问题是有关亚洲和世界和平的问题，讨论这样重大的问题而不允许中立国家，尤其是亚洲中立国家参加，完全是没有道理的。除过像杜勒斯、迪安等一小撮好战分子，在全世界还很难找到反对中立国应参加政治会议的谬论，连美国最要好的“盟国”英国的驻美大使麦金斯，本月二日都承认，印度要是能参加政治会议是会“起有益的作用”的。至于我方坚决主张会谈应首先讨论成员问题也是不难了解的。因为当谁来参加会议的问题还没有解决以前，就去讨论会议的经费如何筹措，会议的设备如何布置是很滑稽的，这除过说明是打算无理取闹或者有意拖延还能说明什么？而迪安的所谓“新方案”中就有类似这样滑稽的方案的。
    美国为什么这样害怕讨论政治会议的成员问题呢？这证明美国害怕政治会议的成员扩大，害怕中立国的参加。因为要是政治会议的成员扩大了，中立国参加了，美国在政治会议中的地位就会更加孤立，美国破坏政治会议的阴谋就会更加暴露，美国在会议上的独断专行就要碰到更大困难，因而，美国实行破坏政治会议的阴谋计划就很难得逞了。人们总还记得，很早以前，美国“纽约邮报”的一位记者在谈到美国为什么反对中立国参加政治会议时就说过：“因为美国想照着它在最近联合国大会上的做法，在政治会议上独行其是。”这位记者又承认：“可靠的外交界人士说，美国不仅希望把印度排斥在政治会议之外，甚至还试图运用一种办法，使英法和其他供应军队给统一司令部的各国在这次会议上没有真正的发言权”。
    问题十分清楚了，美国所以反对讨论政治会议的成员问题，也就是反对一切中立国家参加政治会议，以便美国能像操纵联合国那样来操纵政治会议，以便美国能像破坏联合国的真正威权那样来破坏政治会议的威权，最后，也就便于美国阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决，阻止国际紧张局势的缓和了。为了达到这样一个卑鄙目的，美国就不惜采用一切无赖手段，于是，迪安就大肆玩弄他的拖延会谈的所谓“技巧”和“机智”了。
    板门店的会谈已经进行了快要两个星期了，会议议程问题还一直没有得到合理的解决，美国的代表迪安，正在继续运用他的“技巧、机智和耐性”来实行少数好战分子拖延会谈的计划。据合众社透露，一个接近迪安的人士说：如果会谈继续一周还没有结果的话，“甚至将继续几个月”。
    事实摆得很明显，板门店的会谈没有进展，政治会议就不能召开，这责任完全在于美方，在于杜勒斯和迪安这类美国的好战分子身上。
