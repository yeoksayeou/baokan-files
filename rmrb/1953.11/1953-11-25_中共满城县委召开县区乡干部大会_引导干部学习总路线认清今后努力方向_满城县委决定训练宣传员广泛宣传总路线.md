    The CPC Mancheng County Committee Convenes County, District, and Township Cadre Conference
    Guiding Cadres to Study the General Line and Recognize Future Directions
    Mancheng County Committee Decides to Train Propagandists to Widely Promote the General Line
    [This Newspaper] The CPC Mancheng County Committee of Hebei Province convened an enlarged conference of county, district, and township cadres from November 10th to 18th. Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, delivered a report on the transmission of the general line for the state during the transition period.
    At the meeting, Ma Guorui explained in simple terms the great significance of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. He analyzed in detail the major changes in various aspects of Mancheng County's rural areas since the land reform, using vivid examples experienced by all cadres, especially rural cadres, to illustrate that the lines and policies decided by the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always been correct. Ma Guorui emphasized that to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, the small-scale peasant economy must gradually be transformed into a large-scale socialist agricultural economy through the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Only in this way can production carried out by individual households using backward agricultural tools be transformed into large-scale production collectively using advanced science, technology, and machine cultivation, and can the yield of crops be greatly increased. Ma Guorui further explained that to develop agriculture, it is necessary to develop industry. Only when industry is developed can more agricultural machinery be produced, greatly developing agricultural production.
    After Ma Guorui's report, the cadres present were divided into groups to discuss, focusing on the two questions: "What is the general line for the transition period?" and "Why is it necessary to implement the general line for the transition period? What are the benefits of implementing the general line for the country and the people?" Ma Guorui personally went deep into the groups to assist the cadres in their discussions and patiently explained in detail. Each group focused on the actual situation of their own village and township, and studied the superiority and current situation of local mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some township cadres examined their past mistakes of not seeing that mutual aid and cooperation was the great road to socialism and not providing good leadership. Individual Party member cadres who had withdrawn from or wanted to withdraw from agricultural producers' cooperatives in the past also realized that this was very dangerous. For example, Wu Luoguo, Secretary of the Dongxiantai Township Branch in the Second District, said painfully at the conference: "I have made a mistake and withdrawn from the cooperative. I am determined to make a self-criticism to all Party members and cooperative members when I return, and rejoin the cooperative. I will definitely organize the masses to establish another agricultural producers' cooperative and resolutely lead the masses to take the road of common prosperity." Some groups, in connection with the fact that in the past few years, individual households in the village have lent money, hired laborers, and hoarded grain, and that individual households have sold part of their land due to unexpected disasters and have become more difficult, recognized the harm of the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside. Many groups recalled the bitter life before liberation, and after comparing the past and present, everyone expressed their firm determination to take the socialist road and never take the capitalist road. In the discussion, everyone clearly realized that if all farmers want to live a prosperous life, they must participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, strive to increase grain production, and sell surplus grain to the state to support the state's large-scale economic construction.
    The CPC Mancheng County Committee decided to use the cadres who participated in the conference as the backbone to first conduct education on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period among all Party members and League members before the end of November, and then among all the people, and earnestly help farmers to calculate the three accounts. In particular, it is necessary to combine the actual situation of the village and township with the work of grain requisition and purchase, and Party members and League members should divide the work into areas and households to carry out propaganda and education. In order to do a good job in this propaganda work, the CPC Mancheng County Committee is preparing to convene a county-wide representative meeting of propagandists before the end of November to train the backbone propagandists. After the representative meeting of propagandists, propagandists will be trained universally at the township level, focusing on solving the problem of how to use the specific facts of the township and village to explain the great principles of the general line in the propaganda. By the beginning of December, the propaganda work of the general line in the whole county will be pushed to a climax.

    中共满城县委召开县区乡干部大会
    引导干部学习总路线认清今后努力方向
    满城县委决定训练宣传员广泛宣传总路线
    【本报讯】中共河北省满城县委会于十一月十日到十八日召开了县、区、乡三级干部扩大会议，中共河北省委会第二书记马国瑞在会上作了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线的传达报告。
    马国瑞在会上通俗地讲解了国家的社会主义工业化和国家对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造的重大意义，详细地分析了满城县农村在土地改革以来各方面的重大变化，用全体干部特别是乡村干部亲身经历过的生动事例，说明中共中央、毛主席决定的路线、政策从来都是正确的。马国瑞强调指出，要实现农业的社会主义改造，必须使小农经济经过互助合作的道路，逐渐变成大规模的社会主义农业经济。也只有这样，才能将一家一户用落后的农具进行的生产，变成集体的运用先进科学技术和机器耕作的大规模的生产，才能大量地增加农作物的产量。马国瑞并由此进一步说明要发展农业必须发展工业，工业发展了才能多造农业机器，大大发展农业生产。
    马国瑞报告后，到会干部分组以“什么是过渡时期的总路线？”和“为什么要实行过渡时期的总路线？实行总路线对国家对人民有什么好处？”两题为中心，展开讨论。马国瑞亲自深入小组，协助到会干部进行讨论，并耐心详尽地进行解释。各小组着重从本村、本乡的实际情况出发，研究当地互助组和农业生产合作社的优越性和现状。有的乡干部检讨了过去看不清互助合作就是走社会主义的大道，没有很好地进行领导的错误。个别党员干部过去退出了或者想退出农业生产合作社，这次也认识到这样是很危险的。如二区东贤台乡支部书记吴洛国在大会上沉痛地说：“我已做错了，退了社。回去决心向全体党员和社员作检讨，重新入社。我一定要组织群众再建立一个农业生产合作社，坚决领导群众走大家都富裕的道路。”有的小组联系村里几年来已有个别户放债、雇工、囤粮，个别户因为遇到意外灾害，生活困难，出卖了部分土地，因而更加困难的事实，认识了农村资本主义自发势力的危害性。许多小组回忆了解放前的苦难生活，经过前后对比，大家表示坚决走社会主义的道路，绝不走资本主义的道路。在讨论中，大家明确认识了：全体农民要过富裕生活，就要参加互助合作组织，努力增产粮食，把余粮卖给国家，支持国家大规模的经济建设。
    中共满城县委会决定以参加大会的干部为骨干，在十一月底首先向全体党员、团员，然后向全体人民进行国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的教育，认真地帮助农民算清三笔账；特别要联系本村、本乡的实际情况，结合征粮、购粮工作，由党员、团员分工分片包干、按门按户进行宣传教育。为了做好这次宣传工作，中共满城县委会准备在十一月底以前召开全县宣传员代表会，训练宣传员骨干；在宣传员代表会以后，以乡为单位普遍训练宣传员，着重解决怎样在宣传中以本乡、本村的具体事实说明总路线的大道理的方法问题。到十二月初，全县范围内的总路线的宣传工作，将推向高潮。
