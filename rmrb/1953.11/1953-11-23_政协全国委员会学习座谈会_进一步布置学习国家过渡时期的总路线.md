    CPPCC National Committee Study Forum
    Further Arrangements for Studying the General Line of the State's Transition Period

    The Study Forum of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has begun systematically and comprehensively studying the general line of the state's transition period. On November 20th, the Study Forum held a joint enlarged meeting of various study groups to discuss and arrange this study. Members participating in the Study Forum and individuals in charge of study from the headquarters of various democratic parties attended the meeting.

    The Study Forum is a regular study organization under the leadership of the Study Committee of the CPPCC National Committee. Since Minister Li Weihan delivered a report on the general line of the state's transition period at a report meeting hosted by the CPPCC National Committee on October 10th, members participating in the Study Forum have begun studying issues related to the general line and have achieved preliminary results. In order to make this study more systematic and comprehensive, and to enable participating members to have a clearer and more specific understanding of the general line from theoretical, policy, and practical perspectives, the Study Forum decided to make further arrangements for this study so that the issue of the general line can be well studied within an appropriate and sufficient amount of time.

    Minister Li Weihan was invited to speak at the meeting. He put forward important opinions on the important significance of studying the general line, the content of the study, and the attitude and methods of study. He especially called on everyone to give full play to free thinking and to engage in enthusiastic debates during the study. Any questions and opinions can be raised, and there is no fear of making mistakes, but be prepared to correct errors at any time. At the same time, personal efforts and collective mutual assistance should be well combined in the study. It is necessary to turn over books, use your brains more, and oppose reliance on others. Big and small problems should be gradually clarified through layer-by-layer analysis and layer-by-layer synthesis from the individual to the collective.

    Hu Yuzhi, Executive Member of the Study Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, announced at the meeting the new list of study officers of the committee's Study Secretariat, which had been readjusted to strengthen the leadership of the study. Qu Wu, a study officer, reported on the study plan for the general line, and the plan made preliminary provisions for the study units, outlines, and reference materials.

    Finally, Li Jishen, Chen Shutong, Luo Longji, Wang Shaoyao, Peng Zemin, Xu Deheng, Li Shucheng and others spoke successively at the meeting. They were all excited about the various measures taken to earnestly strengthen the study of the general line, expressed their determination to study hard, and put forward many valuable opinions on the content and methods of study.

    政协全国委员会学习座谈会
    进一步布置学习国家过渡时期的总路线
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习座谈会已开始系统地全面地学习国家过渡时期的总路线。本月二十日，学习座谈会举行了各学习小组联席扩大会议，讨论和布置这一学习。参加学习座谈会的成员和各民主党派总部主持学习的人员都出席了会议。
    学习座谈会是在政协全国委员会学习委员会领导下的经常性的学习组织。自十月十日李维汉部长在政协全国委员会主持的报告会上，作了关于国家过渡时期总路线的传达报告后，参加学习座谈会的成员就开始了有关总路线问题的学习，已取得初步成效。为了使这一学习更能系统地全面地进行，使参加学习的成员从理论、政策和实际等方面对总路线有更明确具体的认识，学习座谈会决定对这一学习进行进一步的布置，以便在适当的充分的时间内，将总路线问题学好。
    李维汉部长应邀在会上讲话。他对学习总路线的重要意义，学习内容和学习的态度和方法，都提出了重要的意见。他特别号召大家在学习中要发挥自由思想，热烈展开辩论，无论什么问题和意见都可以提出来，不怕讲错，但也准备随时修正错误；同时，学习中应该把个人努力和集体互助很好地结合起来，要翻书本，多动脑筋，反对依赖思想，要使大小问题都在从个人到集体的层层分析、层层综合中逐步明确起来。
    政协全国委员会学习委员会常务委员胡愈之在会上宣布了为加强学习领导而重新调整的该会所属的学习干事会的新的干事名单。学习干事屈武报告了关于总路线的学习计划，计划中对学习的单元、提纲和参考书目都作了初步规定。
    会议最后由李济深、陈叔通、罗隆基、王绍鏊、彭泽民、许德珩、李书城等先后发言，他们都为此次认真地加强总路线学习的各项措施而感到兴奋，表示了努力学习的决心，并对学习内容和方法提出了许多宝贵的意见。
