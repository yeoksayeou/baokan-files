    Selling grain to the state for national construction
    Zhang Benzhou takes the lead in selling grain to the state
    Zhang Benzhou, the father of Zhang Jihui, an air force hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a labor model in Qiaoshang Village, Shoujin Township, District 12, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, has taken the lead in actively selling grain to the state.
    Zhang Benzhou's family had a very good harvest this year. Eight mu of wheat land yielded more than 4,000 jin of wheat, and eight mu of soybean land yielded more than 2,000 jin of soybeans. He had already sold more than 1,900 jin of wheat to the cooperative. After the state called for a campaign to increase production and practice thrift, he and his family discussed eating less refined grains and using soybean cakes to feed pigs instead of soybeans, saving some grain to sell to the state to support national construction. They all regarded this as their glorious responsibility and decided to sell another 1,000 jin of wheat and 1,000 jin of soybeans to the state. After selling the grain, he plans to buy 1,000 jin of soybean cakes to feed the pigs with soybean cakes and vegetables; buy 160 jin of fertilizer, ready to "feed" the wheat as soon as spring begins next year, striving for a yield of 700 to 1,000 jin of wheat per mu next year; and use the remaining money to buy some daily necessities and deposit the rest in the bank for savings.
    Driven and influenced by Zhang Benzhou's exemplary actions, the masses in Qiaoshang Village are all planning to actively increase production and practice thrift, and sell more grain to the state. They said: Qiaoshang is a village with high wheat yields, and we will strive to become a model village for selling grain. (Ju Maoqin)
    Cadres and Party members take the lead
    After understanding the importance of the state's grain purchase, cadres and Party members in Qi County, Shanxi Province, first sold their wheat to the state, driving the masses to sell grain enthusiastically. For example, Cao Guozhang, a Party member in Wangxian Village, sold 500 jin of wheat to the state, and Sun Yudian, director of the Sunjiahe Supply and Marketing Cooperative, deposited 800 jin of wheat with the cooperative. Some cadres also publicized the importance of the state's grain purchase to relatives and friends, mobilizing them to sell grain to the state. For example, Yang Yongcheng, deputy section chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the county government, mobilized local farmers to sell 13 shi of wheat to the state in one day when he returned home. Wu Renfu, director of the Pusang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, took the lead in selling 500 jin of wheat to the state, promoting the sale of more than 15,000 jin of wheat in the whole village.
    Qi County has also strengthened publicity and material supply in grain purchase, so it has changed the masses' habit of not selling wheat during the autumn harvest season. The amount of wheat purchased from late September to mid-October in one month reached the amount purchased during the peak season of wheat marketing in August.
          (Huo Xintian Luo Renzhong Fan Zhou Chang Fumei)
    Shen Senquan mobilizes his parents to sell wheat
    Although the 25 mu of wheat in Shen Senquan's family in Qingkou Village, District 3, Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, suffered some disasters this year, it still yielded more than 2,100 jin. After the wheat was harvested, Shen Senquan's 70-year-old father dried the wheat and stored it away. Seeing that farmers everywhere were enthusiastically selling wheat to the state, Shen Senquan thought: I am a Communist Party member and also the director of the supply and marketing cooperative. The state is carrying out industrial construction and needs grain, so I should actively sell grain to the state. Later, he thought that the donkey at home was old and a younger animal should be bought, so he mobilized his parents to sell wheat and buy a mule. At first, his father couldn't understand, saying: "Wheat is scarce this year, and the price will rise in the future." Shen Senquan then guided his parents to recall the past, compare the present, and look to the future, and said:
    "The state is carrying out industrial construction, building factories, and manufacturing tractors, isn't it for the sake of a better life for us ordinary people in the future? Moreover, grain won't increase if it's stored. If we sell the wheat to the state and buy a mule to cultivate the land well, and harvest more grain next year, isn't this beneficial to both the state and individuals?" At the same time, he explained that state-owned trading organizations are fully capable of stabilizing prices, and the price of wheat will not rise in the future.
    Shen Senquan's father and mother understood, so he sold the wheat to the state and bought a young, strong mule. His father got up before dawn to feed the animals and said happily, "We are confident of increasing production next year."
                          (Zhao Senlin Zhang Maocheng)
    Supporting industrial construction is supporting ourselves
    Shanxi Province's famous "Jinci Rice" is produced in the Jinci Village area in the suburbs of Taiyuan City. This year, there was a bumper harvest of rice here, with an average yield of 850 jin per mu. Local farmers deeply realize that they have been able to achieve such a bumper harvest is inseparable from the active support of the workers. For example, Jinci Village and others have purchased more than 200,000 jin of fertilizer this year, averaging 30 to 40 jin per mu, which is an important reason for this year's bumper rice harvest. Many farmers said: "Actively supporting industry will lead to greater prospects for agricultural production." "Supporting industrial construction is supporting ourselves." Yang Houxiao, a farmer in Xiaozhan Village, said: "I used to have little housing and no land. During the land reform, I was given land, and the worker brothers manufactured fertilizer for us, which is how we got this bumper harvest. How can we not sell rice to the state?" He sold 2,000 jin of the best rice, with the most plump grains and dried the most, to the state. The Guo Demao mutual aid group quickly sold 10,000 jin of rice to the state; farmers in Wangguo Village sold 140,000 jin of rice to the state; farmers in Xiaozhan Village sold grain even more enthusiastically, and by October 18, they had sold 310,000 jin of rice to the state. The farmers who sold grain are actively selecting and purchasing farm tools, fertilizer, etc., preparing to strive for a greater harvest next year. (Zhao Xiushen)
    Sell more grain, expand production, and improve life
    The rice harvest in Si Hou Township, Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, was good this year. The local supply and marketing cooperative also did a good job in supplying materials when purchasing rice, and farmers sold grain to the state one after another.
    Before starting to purchase rice, the Si Hou Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened meetings of directors and supervisors to mobilize them to return to their villages to publicize the importance of the state's grain purchase and price policy. At the same time, they increased the types and quantities of commodities according to the needs of the masses. They purchased more than 55,800 jin of vegetable cakes, more than 1,400 jin of fertilizer, and added more than 80 bolts of various fabrics, and the number of samples also increased a lot. Seeing that the cooperative had so many commodities, the farmers were willing to sell grain and buy goods, expand production, and improve their lives.
    In order to facilitate farmers in villages far from the cooperative to sell rice and purchase means of production and daily necessities, the Si Hou Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized mobile purchase and supply teams in early September, delivering goods to the countryside and purchasing on the spot in a planned manner, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers. Farmers in Si Hou Township alone sold more than 6,000 jin of rice in three days; after selling grain, the farmers bought more than 1,100 jin of flower and grass seeds, more than 500 jin of bone meal, and many daily necessities. Many farmers said: Selling grain to the state is the glorious responsibility of farmers. Now the cooperative delivers the goods to our doorsteps and purchases rice in our village, taking care of us like this, we must sell more rice to the state. (Xu Hongzhao Cheng Yeke)
    Let the state control sufficient grain
    Wang Guwen, a farmer in Huarong County, Hunan Province, recently sold more than 500 jin of rice to the Meitian Lake Grain Purchasing Station, and conveniently selected and purchased goods such as fertilizer, clothing, oil, and salt worth 300,000 yuan from the cooperative. Comparing with last year, he happily said: "Last year, more than 500 jin of grain could only be sold for 220,000 to 30,000 yuan, but this year it was sold for more than 300,000 yuan. Selling one shi of grain can even get one zhang six or seven chi of fine goods like poplin, and we farmers can also wear it!" Someone asked him why he was willing to sell a large amount of rice to the state, and he told such a painful lesson: In June this year, during the period of food shortage, he once caught more than ten jin of fish and sold them to buy rice. At that time, the cooperative's rice price was 750 yuan per jin, but it was sold out for a while. He went to private merchants to buy it, the cheap one was 1,800 yuan per sheng (equivalent to about 14 liang per jin), and the expensive one was 2,400 yuan per sheng. He said: "If we sell grain to the cooperative and let the state control sufficient grain, we won't be 'stuck' by profiteers during the period of food shortage!" He also picked up the newly bought poplin material and gestured, saying: "The worker brothers have to eat to carry out construction. If we have grain and refuse to sell it, where will these cheap clothing materials, fertilizers, and farm tools come from!" (Zhou Chang Yang Zhenhua)

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    张本周带头卖粮给国家
    中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧的父亲、山东省荣成县十二区守津乡桥上村劳动模范张本周，积极带头把粮食卖给国家。
    张本周家今年庄稼收成很好。八亩小麦地产麦四千多斤，八亩豆地打了大豆两千多斤。他早已卖给合作社一千九百多斤小麦，在国家号召开展增产节约运动后，他和全家人商量，少吃细粮，并改用豆饼喂猪（过去用大豆），节约一些粮食卖给国家，支援国家建设。他们都把这件事情看作自己的光荣责任，决定再卖给国家一千斤小麦、一千斤大豆。卖粮后，他打算买一千斤豆饼，用豆饼和菜喂猪；买一百六十斤肥田粉，准备明年一开春就“喂”小麦，争取明年每亩小麦产七百斤到一千斤；另外的钱，除了买些日用品等，全送到银行里去储蓄。
    由于张本周的模范行动的推动和影响，桥上村的群众都在打算积极进行增产节约，多卖粮食给国家。他们说：桥上是个小麦丰产村，再争取作个卖粮的模范村。　（鞠茂勤）
    干部、党员起了带头作用
    山西省祁县县、区、村干部和党员，认识了国家收购粮食的重要意义以后，首先把自己的小麦卖给国家，带动群众踊跃卖粮。如王贤村党员曹国章卖给国家小麦五百斤，孙家河供销合作社主任孙玉典把八百斤小麦向合作社存实。有些干部还向亲戚、朋友等宣传国家收购粮食的重要意义，动员他们卖粮给国家。如县政府民政科副科长杨永承回家一天，就动员当地农民卖给国家十三石小麦。蒲桑供销合作社主任吴仁夫带头卖给国家五百斤小麦，推动全村卖出小麦一万五千余斤。
    祁县各地还加强了购粮中的宣传工作和物资供应工作，所以改变了群众秋收时间不卖小麦的习惯，从九月下旬到十月中旬一个月中收购的小麦，达到了八月份小麦上市旺季的收购数量。
          （霍心田　罗仁忠　范　周　常福梅）
    申森全动员父母卖小麦
    山西省潞城县三区清口村申森全家里的二十五亩小麦，今年虽然受了些灾害，还打了两千一百多斤。麦子收下来以后，申森全的七十岁的老父亲把麦子晒得干干净净，存放起来。申森全看到各地农民踊跃把小麦卖给国家，心里想：自己是共产党员，又担任供销合作社主任的职务。国家进行工业建设，需要粮食，自己应该积极卖粮给国家。后来他想到家里的驴子老了，应该买个年轻的牲口，他便去动员父母卖小麦，买骡子。起初，他父亲有些想不通，说：“今年小麦缺，将来要涨价。”申森全便引导父母回忆过去，比现在，看将来，并且说：
    “国家进行工业建设，修工厂，制造拖拉机，还不是为咱老百姓将来过更美满的生活。况且粮食放着也不会多起来。咱把小麦卖给国家，买上个骡子，把土地耕作好，明年打下更多的粮食，这不是对国家、对个人都有利吗？”同时他说明国营贸易机关完全有力量稳定物价，将来小麦不会涨价。
    申森全的父亲、母亲想通了，他便把小麦卖给国家，买了一头年轻的大骡子。他父亲天不明就起来喂牲口，还高兴地说：“明年增产有了把握。”
                          （赵森林　张茂成）
    支援工业建设，就是支援自己
    山西省著名的“晋祠大米”，出产在太原市郊区晋祠村一带。今年这里水稻丰收，每亩平均产稻八百五十斤。当地农民深刻认识到，他们能够得到这样的丰收，是和工人的积极支援分不开的。譬如晋祠村等，今年买了二十余万斤肥田粉，每亩平均上三十到四十斤，这是今年水稻丰收的重要原因。许多农民说：“积极支援工业，农业生产才能有更大的前途。”“支援工业建设，就是支援自己。”小站村农民杨候小说：“咱过去少房没地，土地改革时分到了土地，又有工人老大哥给咱制造出肥田粉来，这才得到了丰收。咱怎么还能不把稻谷卖给国家呢？”他把先打下的颗粒最饱、晒得最干的顶好的稻谷卖给国家两千斤。郭德茂互助组很快卖给国家稻谷一万斤；王郭村农民卖给国家稻谷十四万斤；小站村农民卖粮更加踊跃，到十月十八日，卖给国家的稻谷有三十一万斤。卖了粮食的农民，正积极选购农具、肥田粉等，准备争取明年更大的丰收。　（赵修身）
    多卖粮食，扩大生产，改善生活
    浙江省龙游县寺后乡今年稻谷收成不错，这里的供销合作社收购稻谷时又作好了物资供应工作，农民们纷纷把粮食卖给国家。
    寺后供销合作社在开始收购稻谷以前，召开理事、监事会议，动员他们回村宣传了国家收购粮食的重要意义和价格政策。同时根据群众需要增加了商品种类和数量。他们采购的菜饼有五万五千八百多斤，肥田粉有一千四百多斤，增添的各种布匹有八十多匹，样品也增加很多。农民看到合作社有这么多商品，都愿意卖粮食买货物，扩大生产，改善生活。
    寺后供销合作社为了便利离合作社较远村庄的农民出卖稻谷和购买生产资料和生活资料，在九月初组织流动收购供应组，有计划地送货下乡和就地收购，受到农民热烈欢迎。仅寺后乡一村的农民，三天中就卖出稻谷六千多斤；农民卖粮后买了一千一百多斤花草籽，五百多斤牛骨粉，和许多生活用品。许多农民说：把粮食卖给国家是农民的光荣责任。如今合作社又把货送到我们门口来，在我们村场里收购稻谷，这样照顾我们，我们一定要多把稻谷卖给国家。　（徐鸿照　程也可）
    让国家掌握足够的粮食
    湖南省华容县农民王古文最近有一次到梅田湖粮食收购站卖了五百多斤稻谷，随手从合作社选购了三十万元的肥料、衣料、油、盐等货物。他和去年一比较，高兴地说：“去年五百多斤谷子，只能卖二十二、三万元，今年卖了三十多万元。卖一石谷，连府绸这样的稀货也能撕得一丈六、七尺，我们农民也能穿它了！”有人问他为什么愿意将稻谷大量卖给国家，他讲了这样一段痛苦的教训：今年六月，青黄不接的时候，有一次他捕了十几斤鱼，卖掉后要买大米。当时合作社米价每斤七百五十元，可是一时卖光了。他就到私商那儿去买，便宜的一千八百元一升（合一斤十四两左右），贵的一升二千四百元。他说：“如果我们把粮食卖给合作社，让国家掌握足够的粮食，在青黄不接的时候，也不至于受奸商的‘卡’！”他还拿起刚买到的府绸料子比划着说：“工人老大哥搞建设要吃饭，我们如果有粮食不肯卖，这些便宜的衣料子和肥料、农具等又从那里来呢！”　（周　昶　杨振华）
