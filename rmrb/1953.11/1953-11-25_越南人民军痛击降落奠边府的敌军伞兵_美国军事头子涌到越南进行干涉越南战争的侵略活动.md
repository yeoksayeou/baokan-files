Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency, November 23rd: Enemy troops airdropped paratroopers into Dien Bien Phu (near the northern border of Laos), 100 kilometers from the capital of Lai Châu province, on the morning of November 20th. Preliminary reports indicate the enemy paratroopers numbered about two battalions. They were met with a heavy blow from the Vietnamese People's Army as soon as they landed. Fighting is currently continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: According to a dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: A communique issued on the 23rd stated that French colonialists airdropped a batch of paratroop units into Dien Bien Phu on the 20th. The next day, the enemy airdropped more troops into the area. Currently, the number of enemy troops airlifted to Dien Bien Phu is about four battalions. They were immediately attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army as soon as they landed.

The communique continued that Dien Bien Phu is a district of Lai Châu province, bordering northern Laos. Dien Bien Phu is located 100 kilometers south of the capital of Lai Châu province and more than 100 kilometers southeast of Phong Saly in Laos. It lies within the boundless and rich northwestern granary – the Meng Qing area. During the autumn and winter of 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive against the enemy and liberated most of the northwestern region.

The communique stated that in August of this year, the French colonialists were forced to withdraw from Na San, intending to gather more mobile troops to deal with the activities of the Vietnamese People's Army in the North Vietnam delta; and to directly aid armed bandits in the northwest region, disrupting our rear. However, by the end of October and the beginning of November, the People's Army victoriously eliminated approximately two thousand bandits in Meng Lin and Shun Zhou in Son La province.

The communique concluded: Due to insufficient troop strength, the French colonialists had to withdraw troops from Na San and concentrate their mobile forces in the North Vietnam delta. However, with Lai Châu threatened and northern Laos exposed, they were forced to transfer mobile troops from the delta to Dien Bien Phu. This is how Navarre is "regaining military initiative." But this only illustrates Navarre's dilemma and passive position: to concentrate troops or to disperse them? To take care of the Northwest front, or to take care of the North Vietnam delta? This proves that Navarre is in a very difficult situation.

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: According to a dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are continuously striking the enemy in various locations, achieving victories.

On November 2nd, the Vietnamese People's Army intercepted the 56th Battalion of the Bao Dai puppet army on Highway 21 (Phu Ly - Nam Dinh) in Ha Nam province, North Vietnam. In the interception, the People's Army killed 90 enemy troops, including the deputy battalion commander, and captured 31; seized four machine guns and many rifles.

The local forces and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army in Phu Yen province, central southern Vietnam, fiercely intercepted enemy troops landing on the coast of Phu Yen province on September 28th and October 10th. Although the enemy troops landing each time numbered five or six hundred, and had air support, they suffered 250 casualties and were forced to retreat.

In My Tho province, South Vietnam, the People's Army launched an attack on the enemy stronghold in Cai Lay district starting on the evening of October 23rd. After two nights and one day of fighting, the People's Army eliminated one enemy stronghold, killing or wounding one enemy platoon.

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: American military leaders are frequently swarming to Vietnam, carrying out aggressive activities to intensify the expansion of interference in the Vietnam War. Immediately after US Vice President Nixon left Vietnam, US Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel and Pacific Fleet Commander Stump successively arrived in Saigon to "inspect."

O'Daniel led a delegation to Vietnam this summer, using the excuse of checking "whether US aid is being used properly," attempting to pressure France to allow the United States to directly participate in combat plans. The Associated Press said that O'Daniel's return to Vietnam this time involved inspecting the North Vietnam war zone, meeting with North Vietnam French Commander Cogny, and "re-examining" the French army's "use of US military equipment in combat."

Stump also inspected the North Vietnam war zone. According to the Associated Press, Stump had talks with the French invading army authorities, one of the main contents of which was the issue of American "aid."

At the same time, the United States appointed Everett, who had served in the US troops in French North Africa, as the deputy director of the US Technical and Economic Mission to Indochina on the 13th, in order to strengthen its economic aggression agency in Vietnam.

### 越南人民军痛击降落奠边府的敌军伞兵  美国军事头子涌到越南进行干涉越南战争的侵略活动

    越南人民军痛击降落奠边府的敌军伞兵  
    美国军事头子涌到越南进行干涉越南战争的侵略活动
    【新华社二十三日讯】越南通讯社北越讯：敌军在十一月二十日早晨向距莱州省省会一百公里的奠边府（靠寮国北部边界）空投伞兵。据初步消息说，敌军伞兵约有两营人。他们刚一着陆就遭到越南人民军的痛击。现战斗仍在继续进行中。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：二十三日发表的公报说，法国殖民者于二十日在奠边府空降了一批伞兵部队。第二天，敌军在这一地区又空降了一些部队。目前，空运到奠边府的敌军人数约有四个营。他们刚一着陆的时候，立即遭到越南人民军的攻击。
    公报接着说，奠边府是莱州省的一个县，与寮国北部接界。奠边府位于莱州省会以南一百公里和寮国封萨里东南一百多公里的地方，它位于无垠而丰富的西北谷仓——孟清地区内。越南人民军在一九五二年的秋冬时节向敌军发动攻势，解放了绝大部分西北地区。
    公报说，今年八月，法国殖民者被迫退出了那产，打算纠集更多的机动部队来对付北越三角洲越南人民军的活动；并直接援助西北地区的武装匪徒，扰乱我们的后方。但到十月底和十一月初，人民军胜利地消灭了山萝省孟林和顺州的约二千名匪徒。
    公报最后说：法国殖民者由于兵力不足，不得不撤出那产的军队，并在北越三角洲集中它的机动部队。但是，由于莱州受到了威胁，寮国北部又暴露出来了，他们又被迫把机动部队从三角洲调到奠边府。这就是纳瓦尔“重新取得军事主动权”的方法。但这仅仅说明纳瓦尔进退维谷和处于被动的地位：要集中部队，还是分散部队呢？要顾西北战线，还是要顾北越三角洲呢？这证明纳瓦尔正陷入非常困难的境地中。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越人民武装不断在各地打击敌军，取得胜利。
    十一月二日，越南人民军在北越河南省的第二十一号公路（府里—南定）上截击保大伪军第五十六营。人民军在截击中打死包括该营副营长的敌军九十名，俘掳三十一名；缴获机枪四挺和许多步枪。
    中越南部富安省的越南人民军地方部队和游击队，在九月二十八日和十月十日猛烈截击了两次在富安省海岸登陆的敌军。虽然两次登陆的敌军都有五六百人，并有飞机支援，但是却遭到了死伤二百五十人的损失而被迫撤退。
    在南越美萩省，人民军从十月二十三日晚上开始对丐礼县敌军据点发动进攻，经过两夜一天的战斗，人民军拔除敌军据点一处，杀伤敌军一个排。
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国军事首脑频繁地涌到越南，进行加紧扩大干涉越南战争的侵略活动。紧接着美国副总统尼克松离开越南之后，美国太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔、太平洋舰队司令斯图普相继到达西贡“视察”。
    奥丹尼尔在今年夏天曾带了一个代表团到越南，藉口检查“美援是否运用得当”，企图压迫法国允许美国直接参与作战计划。美联社说，奥丹尼尔这次再来越南，曾到北越战区视察，和北越法军司令戈涅会谈，并“重新看看”法军“使用美国军事装备作战的情况”。
    斯图普也曾到北越战区视察。据美联社透露，斯图普曾和侵越法军当局会谈，主要内容之一是美国“援助”问题。
    同时，美国已在十三日任命曾在美国驻法属北非的部队中服务的埃弗雷特为美国驻印度支那技术与经济代表团副团长，以加强它在越南的经济侵略机构。
