Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 3rd: On November 3rd, our side conducted interpretation work for the Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 48. Despite the vicious efforts of the U.S. "representatives" and special agent elements disguised as prisoners of war to disrupt and sabotage the interpretation work, and openly prevent prisoners of war from requesting repatriation, nineteen prisoners of war still broke through the control of the special agents and requested repatriation. These nineteen prisoners of war were handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at 6:00 PM today. Also repatriated with them were twelve Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who took the opportunity to escape the control of special agents and requested repatriation during the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the murder of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war Zhang Zilong by special agents. The fact that many of our prisoners of war broke through the control of special agents to request repatriation once again powerfully demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. "refusal to repatriation" deception.

At 9:15 AM today, the Korean-Chinese side first broadcast to the Korean People's Army prisoners of war who arrived at the interpretation site, explaining matters related to returning home to live peaceful lives. However, one hour before the broadcast began, special agents openly forced the prisoners of war into tents, preventing them from listening to the broadcast. After the broadcast started, special agents desperately beat drums and forced the prisoners of war to shout, make noise, bang on lunchboxes, sing, and jump wildly, creating extreme noise, making it difficult for the prisoners of war to hear the content of the broadcast.

Today, the special agents came up with a new trick to sabotage the interpretation work. At 10:05 AM, after the interpretation work began, many prisoners of war were forced by special agents to wear makeup to listen to the interpretation, some with painted faces, some wearing masks. Special agents disguised as prisoners of war also wore makeup to listen to the interpretation. They shouted insults in the interpretation tents, and some even attempted to beat our interpretation representatives, disrupting the progress of the interpretation work. This new trick by the special agents was clearly intended to make it easier to mingle among the prisoners of war in order to wantonly sabotage the interpretation work.

While the interpretation work was in progress, the U.S. "observer representatives" and "detaining power representatives" used various shameless means to intimidate the prisoners of war, preventing them from requesting repatriation, and interfering with the progress of the interpretation work. In Interpretation Tent No. 15, after a special agent entered the tent, he respectfully saluted the South Korean U.S. "observer representative," and this "representative" returned the salute. The chairman of the subsidiary body immediately stopped him, warning him that if he saluted the "prisoners of war" again, he would be expelled. At the same time, the two U.S. "representatives" in this interpretation tent constantly shook their heads and intimidated the prisoners of war, preventing them from requesting repatriation. The chairman of the subsidiary body had no choice but to move the stools so that the prisoners of war were facing away from them.

In Interpretation Tent No. 19, the South Korean U.S. "representative" deliberately created various excuses to interrupt the interpretation work. On one occasion, he falsely accused the Korean interpretation representative of using phrases in his interpretation that "violated the agreement." Although the chairman of the subsidiary body told him that this did not violate the agreement, he still refused to let it go, delaying the interpretation work for forty minutes. After this, this Li bandit special agent continued to put forward many absurd opinions to obstruct the progress of the interpretation work. In Interpretation Tent No. 1, the U.S. "detaining power representative" and "observer representative" randomly put forward absurd opinions during the interpretation work, obstructing the interpretation work.

Today, the Korean-Chinese side has submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a plan to conduct interpretation work for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 28 tomorrow. Camp No. 28 is the camp where the murder of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war Zhang Zilong by special agents occurred.

### 美方“代表”及特务全力破坏本月三日的解释工作  我方被俘人员十九名突破控制遣返归来

    美方“代表”及特务全力破坏本月三日的解释工作
    我方被俘人员十九名突破控制遣返归来
    【新华社开城三日电】十一月三日，我方对第四十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。尽管美方“代表”和冒充战俘的特务分子穷凶极恶地捣乱和破坏解释工作，公然阻止战俘要求遣返，但是仍然有十九名战俘突破特务控制要求遣返。这十九名战俘已在今天下午六时由中立国遣返委员会遣送给我方。与他们一同遣返的还有十二名在中立国遣返委员会调查中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙被特务分子谋杀案件时，乘机逃出特务控制要求遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。许多我方被俘人员突破特务控制要求遣返的事实，又一次有力地说明了美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”骗局的彻底破产。
    今天上午九时十五分，朝中方面首先向到达解释场所的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行广播，向他们解释有关回家过和平生活的事项。但是，在广播开始以前一个小时，特务分子就公然把战俘强迫赶到帐篷去，不许他们听取广播。广播开始以后，特务分子就拚命敲鼓，并且强迫战俘大叫大闹、敲饭盒、唱歌和狂跳，造成了极大的噪音，使得战俘听不清楚广播的内容。
    今天，特务分子又想出了一个破坏解释工作的新花样。十时零五分，解释工作开始以后，有许多战俘被特务分子强迫化了妆来听取解释，有的涂了花脸，有的戴了假面具。冒充战俘的特务分子也化装来听解释，他们在解释帐篷里嘶喊辱骂，有的还企图殴打我方解释代表，捣乱解释工作的进行。特务分子的这个新花样显然是为了更容易地混杂在战俘中间，以便放肆地破坏解释工作。
    在解释工作进行时，美方“观察代表”和“拘留方代表”用各种无耻手段，恫吓战俘不得要求遣返，和干扰解释工作的进行。在第十五号解释帐篷里，一个特务分子走进帐篷后，就对南朝鲜籍的美方“观察代表”恭顺地敬礼，这个“代表”还了礼。附属机构主席当即制止他，警告他如果再对“战俘”还礼，就要把他驱逐出去。同时，这个解释帐篷里的两个美方“代表”都不断地摇头摆脑恫吓战俘不得要求遣返。附属机构主席只得把凳子移动，使战俘背对着他们。
    在第十九号解释帐篷里，南朝鲜籍美方“代表”故意制造各种藉口中断解释工作。有一次，他诬蔑朝鲜解释代表的解释词有“违反协定”的词句。虽然附属机构的主席告诉他这并不违反协定，但是他仍旧不肯干休，一直把解释工作延误了四十分钟。在这以后，这个李匪特务分子又故意不断地提出许多荒谬意见，妨碍解释工作的进行。在第一号解释帐篷里，美方“拘留方代表”和“观察代表”在解释工作进行时，胡乱提出荒谬意见，阻挠解释工作。
    今天，朝中方面已向中立国遣返委员会提出明天对第二十八号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释的计划。第二十八号营场就是发生中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙被特务分子谋杀案件的营场。
