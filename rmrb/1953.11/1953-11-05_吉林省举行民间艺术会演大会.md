    Jilin Province Holds Folk Art Performance Convention
    The Jilin Provincial People's Government Cultural Bureau held the first Jilin Province Folk Art Performance Convention from October 20th to 27th. A total of 137 programs were performed, encompassing 48 forms. Among them, the two-person comedy "Yang Ba Jie's Spring Outing" and "The West Chamber," performed by famous Jilin artists Wang Yunpeng, Gu Zhenduo, and Yang Fusheng, vividly portrayed the characters in the plays with skilled techniques, simple singing, and dancing, accurately expressing the characters' emotions, and were warmly welcomed by the participants. Daobuqin Sengge, the Mongolian representative from Guoqian Banner, performed a solo on the horse-head fiddle, full of the rich atmosphere of grassland life. In terms of dance, the "Fan Dance" performed by the delegation from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region weaved various beautiful patterns with light and graceful dance. The "Sama Dance" was a dance performed by Mongolians in the past to worship gods, and "Old Man Carries Wife" was originally a small scene in the large Yangko dance; both are folk arts that were almost lost.
    In addition, many folk artists at this convention used familiar forms to express new life. For example, Wang Jiukun, a folk artist from Fuyu County, performed "Talking About Hygiene" and some short poems improvised at the convention; the two-person comedy "Visiting Relatives" performed by the Huaide County delegation, and the drum song "Granny Jie Writes to Chairman Mao" were all praised by the convention.

    吉林省举行民间艺术会演大会
    吉林省人民政府文化局自十月二十日至二十七日举办了吉林省第一届民间艺术会演大会。共演出了一百三十七个节目，包括四十八种形式。其中如吉林著名艺人王云鹏、谷振铎、杨福盛等表演的二人转“杨八姐游春”、“西厢”，均以熟练的技巧、朴素的演唱和舞蹈，生动地刻划了剧中人物的性格，确切地表达出人物的情感，受到与会者热烈的欢迎。郭前旗蒙族代表道布钦僧格的马头琴独奏，充满了草原生活的浓厚气氛。在舞蹈方面，延边朝鲜民族自治区代表团演出的“扇子舞”，以轻盈的舞蹈编织成各种美丽的图案。“萨玛舞”为蒙族过去祀神跳的舞蹈，“老汉背妻”原为大秧歌中的一个小场，都是几乎失传的民间艺术。
    另外，这次会演中有许多民间艺人以群众熟悉的形式表现了新的生活。如扶余县民间艺人王九坤表演的“说卫生”和在大会上即兴编出来的一些短诗；怀德县代表团表演的二人转“串亲家”，大鼓“解大娘上书毛主席”等，都受到了大会的赞扬。
