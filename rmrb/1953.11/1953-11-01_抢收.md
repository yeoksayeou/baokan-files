　　Rushing to Harvest
　　Li Hongru
　　In August, the rice in Jiexing Township, Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, ripened. The land was covered with golden rice ears, and people were rejoicing at the approaching harvest. In the second village, there were two families of volunteer soldiers, Lan Weiwu and Lan Weikai, whose 1.4 mu of rice grew better than in previous years. They said with smiles, "This is all thanks to the care of the Party and the government, and the good work of the Tang Yingfu mutual aid team!"
　　Tang Yingfu is the village chief of the second village and a Communist Party member. He led the mutual aid team to work the fields for the military families, and he was just as meticulous as if he were working for himself, not even a bit careless. Since his mutual aid team has been cultivating for these two military families, there has been a bumper harvest every year in the fields, and this year's rice is growing even better. He said, "This is our practical expression of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea!"
　　On August 20th, Tang Yingfu was digging mud in the fields. Suddenly, the voice of the village propagandist came from the top of the mountain: "Folks, hurry up and harvest the rice, there will be strong winds and heavy rain in the next two days!" Sure enough, the weather changed in a short while. The sun, which had been scorching hot, suddenly retreated into the dark clouds. The weather was very muggy. Then, a flash of lightning and a rumble of thunder sounded. A cool breeze blew, and Tang Yingfu couldn't help but shiver. He looked up at the sky, where the heavy rain had already sealed off the high mountains, and judging from the wind, the heavy rain would be coming soon. Looking again at the 1.4 mu of rice belonging to Lan Weiwu and Lan Weikai, which was about to be harvested, it was swaying in the strong wind. Before he could finish smoking a bag of tobacco, the heavy rain poured down. Tang Yingfu hesitated for a moment and then went back in the rain to discuss a solution with the team members.
　　The rain was getting heavier and heavier. The nearby river was also rising, and it looked like the 1.4 mu of rice was about to be flooded by the water. When people saw this situation and thought about the volunteer soldiers and the hometown they were defending, who could not feel distressed? At the emergency meeting of the mutual aid team, the team members all said in unison: "Let's go into the water to cut the rice!" Tang Yingfu also said: "I'm not afraid of mud on the rice, I'll thresh it!" Soon, everyone took their sickles, carried bamboo baskets, ... and set off for the military families' fields, braving the wind and rain to start the tense harvesting.
　　At about 2 p.m., the rain stopped. The river water also slowly receded, but the rice in the paddy fields was still lying down. The team members carefully cut the rice, and Tang Yingfu and another team member were threshing it busily. When it was almost dark, the 1.4 mu of rice was also cut and threshed. Basket after basket of rice was sent to the homes of Lan Weiwu and Lan Weikai. When they saw this situation, they were moved to tears and hurriedly boiled hot water for the team members of the mutual aid team to bathe, boiled water to quench their thirst, and also said: "We must write a letter to tell our sons about this, and tell them to defend our homeland and our country well!"

    八月，四川省中江县杰兴乡的稻子成熟了。大地被金黄色的谷穗遮盖着，人们都在庆幸快要到来的丰收。第二村有两个志愿军军属蓝维五、蓝维开，他们的一亩四分稻子，比往年长得都好。他们笑盈盈地说：“这全是党和政府照顾得好，唐应富互助组代耕得好！”
    唐应富，是第二村的村主任，共产党员。他领导互助组给军属做庄稼，硬是和给自己干活一样，一点都不马虎。自从他的互助组给这两家军属代耕后，地里年年都是丰收，今年的谷子长得更好。他说：“这就是我们抗美援朝的实际表现！”
    八月二十日，唐应富正在田里挖泥巴。突然，山顶上传来村里宣传员的声音：“乡亲们，赶紧抢收谷子啊，最近两天，要刮大风，下大雨呀！”不一会，天气果真变了。晒得透热的太阳，突然缩进乌云里去了。天气十分闷热。接着，电光一闪，雷声也轰隆地响起来。一股凉风吹来，唐应富禁不住打了一个寒战。他抬头望了望天，那边，大雨已封闭住了高高的山峰，看风势，大雨很快就要过来了。再看看蓝维五、蓝维开那一亩四分快要收割的谷子，正在大风中摇摆着。不到吸一袋烟的功夫，大雨就倾泻下来。唐应富稍微迟疑了一下，就冒雨回去和组员们商议办法了。
    雨，越下越大。附近的河水也上涨了，眼看那一亩四分谷子就要被大水淹没了。人们看到这种情景，再想想志愿军和他们所保卫的家乡，谁能不心疼呢？在互助组的紧急会议上，组员们都异口同声地说：“到水里去割谷子！”唐应富也说：“我不怕谷子上有泥巴，我来打！”很快，大伙拿着镰刀、挑着箩篼，……就出发到军属的地里，冒着大风大雨开始了紧张的收割。
    约摸下午两点钟，雨停了。河水也慢慢地落下去，可是稻田里的谷子仍然倒伏着。组员们细心地割着谷子，唐应富和另外一个组员，在紧张地打着。天快黑时，一亩四分谷子也割完、打完了。一挑挑的谷子，送到了蓝维五、蓝维开的家里。他们看到这种情景，都感动得流下眼泪，慌忙给互助组的组员们烧热水洗澡，烧开水解渴，还说：“我们一定把这件事写信告诉我们的儿子，叫他们好好保卫咱们的家乡，保卫咱们的国家！”
