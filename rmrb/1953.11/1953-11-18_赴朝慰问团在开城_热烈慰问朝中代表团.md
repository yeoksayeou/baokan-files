Xinhua News Agency report: The General Delegation and the First General Sub-Delegation of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea held separate consolation meetings on the 15th and 16th to comfort the Korean-Chinese side representatives of the Korean Military Armistice Commission. They presented gifts to the Korean-Chinese side representatives, including a silk banner embroidered with "Long Live the Victory of World Peace." The delegation's performing arts troupe gave a wonderful consolation performance after the meeting.贺龙 (He Long), the head of the delegation, delivered a speech of consolation at the meeting on the 15th to the representatives of the Korean People's Army of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission. He said: The Korean people, in their struggle against the American aggressors, will always receive the full support of the entire Chinese people. If the American aggressors and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang dare to recklessly provoke, undermine the armistice, and restart the war, then the Korean-Chinese people and the Korean-Chinese people's forces will surely inflict an even more thorough and tragic defeat upon them.

On the 16th, the delegation held a consolation meeting for the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission at Manwol台 (Manwol Hill) Square in Kaesong. Delegation head 贺龙 (He Long), in his speech, praised the great achievements of the Korean-Chinese delegation standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace. He said: Your struggle has made the Chinese people and the people of the world more clearly recognize the ugly face of American imperialism and strengthened the determination of the Chinese people and the people of the world to oppose aggression and defend peace. The people of the motherland attach great importance to your achievements and are constantly concerned about you. General 贺龙 (He Long) concluded by saying: On the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, serious and arduous struggles are still required. We must be vigilant, give play to the tenacity and perseverance of the struggle, and defeat the conspiracies of American imperialism in the negotiations as well.

李相朝 (Ri Sang-jo), Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission and Lieutenant General of the Korean People's Army, and 丁国钰 (Ding Guoyu), Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side and General of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered replies at the two meetings respectively.
