Premier, Vice Premiers, Honorable Members, Comrades:

Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China in 1950, new marriage and family relationships have been developing, and feudal marriage and family relationships have begun to be criticized and attacked. In the winter of 1951, relevant departments of the central and local political and legal systems conducted an inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law in some areas, which played a certain role in promoting it. However, the implementation of the Marriage Law across the country is very uneven. In most areas, not only the people but also many government workers, due to the lack of serious publicity, education and inspection, know little about the Marriage Law or have many misunderstandings, and even resistance. Therefore, the phenomena of unfree marriage, women being abused and persecuted by their parents-in-law and husbands, and even committing suicide or being killed, still exist seriously. In view of this situation, it was decided to launch a nationwide campaign to implement the Marriage Law this March (except for ethnic minority areas and areas where land reform has not been completed). This campaign to implement the Marriage Law ended successively in various parts of the country in April and May. Today, on behalf of the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law Movement, I submit to the State Council's Political Affairs Conference a summary report on the Implementation of the Marriage Law Movement. Is it appropriate? Please review.

I. Situation and Achievements

The Marriage Law Implementation Committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the implementation of the Marriage Law, began to prepare for the movement. In January and February of this year, 2,726 typical experiments were conducted in rural areas, factories, mines, and streets across the country, training more than 3.47 million grassroots cadres and a large number of propagandists and activists among the people. It also issued an outline for the propaganda of the Marriage Law, printed and distributed more than 20 million copies of various publicity materials on the Marriage Law, and used newspapers, periodicals, picture books, comic strips, reports, forums, broadcasts, storytelling, dramas, slide shows, movies, and other means to launch publicity to the broad masses of people in about 70% of the country's regions in March and April this year. During the typical experiments, varying degrees of hasty and rash deviations occurred in various places. Upon discovery, they were corrected to bring the movement into line, move forward steadily, and achieve due results.

This movement, on the one hand, was the first systematic and universal publicity of the Marriage Law nationwide since its promulgation. It systematically exposed and criticized feudal ideas and habits on marriage issues, and inspected the implementation of the Marriage Law by personnel in charge of marriage affairs in courts and civil affairs departments above the county level, as well as cadres of district and township (village) governments. On the other hand, according to the central government's policy on implementing the Marriage Law, it correctly handled many marriage issues. That is: for the phenomenon of family undemocracy and disharmony caused by the feudal marriage system, persuasion and education were adopted to call on them to consciously improve, which won the support of the broad masses of people. In this movement, tens of thousands of people in various places, dissatisfied with their feudal family relationships, rose up to demand improvement. They adopted methods such as holding democratic family meetings, where mothers-in-law, husbands, and daughters-in-law reviewed each other and corrected their mistakes. Many of them also signed covenants of mutual respect and love. For those couples whose relationship was very bad and could not continue to live together, their divorce requests were approved after unsuccessful persuasion. The criminals who killed and injured women were investigated and punished by the people's judicial organs with due penalties. The adopted daughters-in-law who requested to dissolve their childhood betrothal relationships were granted their requests. Young men and women who met the requirements of the Marriage Law and requested to marry were issued marriage registration certificates. These correct measures not only severely cracked down on feudal ideas on marriage issues but also strongly supported the just struggle of the people to strive for freedom of marriage. As a result, social mores have greatly changed, and the implementation of freedom of marriage and equal rights for men and women has gradually expanded social sympathy. The act of arranging marriages for children and abusing women has gradually been opposed by social public opinion. According to reports from various places, after the implementation of the Marriage Law movement, a large number of new-style democratic and harmonious families have emerged. The number of young men and women seeking free marriage registering with district and township governments has increased significantly. The phenomenon of abuse of women, especially the killing and injuring of women, has generally decreased. Some areas have stopped the occurrence of this phenomenon.

When the broad masses of people gained freedom of marriage and improved the relationship between husband and wife and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, their enthusiasm for participating in social activities, especially in production, became even higher. Many women who never participated in social activities now participate in various social activities like men, and a large number of activists have emerged to participate in the work of grassroots governments and women's congresses, people's congresses, and production mutual aid organizations. In rural areas and factories and mines where the Marriage Law movement was implemented more deeply, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of men and women was unprecedentedly high, and production efficiency was significantly improved. These facts have also educated the broad masses of people, making them more deeply aware that the feudal marriage system is not only a shackle that binds women but also an obstacle to the development of production. They said: "The more feudal, the more quarrels, the more awkward, the less energy to work"; "The more democratic, the more harmonious, the more pleasant, the greater the enthusiasm for labor." Therefore, they are more supportive of the Marriage Law and work harder, showing a new atmosphere of unity, harmony, happiness, and enthusiastic labor.

This movement also educated cadres of people's governments at all levels, making them further clarify the great significance of implementing the Marriage Law, recognize the long-term, complex, and arduous nature of the work of implementing the Marriage Law, and the importance of adhering to the education policy, especially educating and training the vast number of grassroots cadres, criticizing their erroneous understanding of the Marriage Law, correcting the phenomenon of cadres interfering with freedom of marriage and ignoring the suffering of the people, strengthening their sense of responsibility in implementing the Marriage Law and their mass perspective, and in the movement, a large number of model cadres in implementing the Marriage Law emerged, laying the foundation for continuing to implement the Marriage Law in the future.

However, the above achievements are not universal. From a national perspective, the breadth and depth of the movement are unbalanced. Even within the scope of a province, a county, or a district, there are differences, with good and bad. Generally, it can be divided into three types: The first type: according to the central instructions, it has been universally and deeply implemented. Cadres have drawn a clear line between the old and new marriage systems, actively support freedom of marriage, and can handle the people's marriage problems in accordance with the basic spirit of the Marriage Law; 80% to 90% of adults among the people have been educated; the new atmosphere of freedom of marriage, equal rights for men and women, and democratic and harmonious families has begun to be established, becoming a position for implementing the Marriage Law in the future. This type of area accounts for about 15%. The second type: most cadres have drawn a clear line between the old and new marriage systems; 60% to 70% of adults among the people have been educated, and they are very supportive of family harmony and united production. Old marriage customs have been diluted, and the new marriage system has begun to be implemented, but some of them still have some concerns and doubts about freedom of marriage and equal rights for men and women;
  The relationship between some couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law has been initially improved, but the incidents of abuse and killing of women cannot be completely stopped. This type of area accounts for about 60%. The third type: cadres and the people have only a superficial understanding of the Marriage Law and still have many doubts and misunderstandings; the phenomenon of women's suicide and being killed still exists seriously. This type of area accounts for about 25%. It can be seen that this campaign to implement the Marriage Law was not only not universal in the areas where the Marriage Law campaign was carried out, but also not and could not be universally implemented deeply even in the areas where the Marriage Law campaign was carried out. Therefore, this only created a good start for the work of implementing the Marriage Law in the future, and thoroughly solving the problem still requires continued efforts.

II. Several Key Experiences

From this campaign to implement the Marriage Law, we deeply realized that although China's feudal forces have been politically and economically defeated, due to China's backward economy and culture, the broad masses of people still retain feudal ideas and feudal consciousness in many social customs under the influence of thousands of years of feudal rule, and the feudal ideas and feudal consciousness on marriage issues are among the more common and serious. The feudal marriage system and the feudal ideas under its influence not only caused great pain to families, especially women, but also greatly hindered the development of the new socialist economy and culture. Therefore, implementing the Marriage Law is not only the urgent requirement of the broad masses of young men and women, especially women, but also conforms to the vital interests of the entire people and is conducive to the country's economic and cultural construction. Facts have proved that wherever the Marriage Law is truly implemented, there will be countless new democratic and harmonious families, people will happily and actively participate in social activities and production and construction, and society will show a new atmosphere. Wherever the Marriage Law is not implemented, the marriage and family problems of many people cannot be solved, the phenomenon of family disharmony and abuse of women is widespread, and even deaths occur. Some comrades do not understand the great significance of implementing the Marriage Law and have a cold and resistant attitude towards implementing the Marriage Law, which is obviously wrong. Lenin taught us that the relationship between the sexes and family issues are by no means personal private affairs or trivial matters of life, but matters of great social significance. Therefore, the work of implementing the Marriage Law should become an important political task for people's governments at all levels and the people of the whole country.

From the experience and lessons of this campaign to implement the Marriage Law, we have more clearly realized the nature of the reform of the marriage system as a matter entirely internal to the people, and that only by adhering to the policy of education is the most correct policy when solving this complex marriage problem within the people. Chairman Mao taught us: "Contradictions of different qualities can only be resolved by methods of different qualities." We must never confuse the feudal ideas and feudal habits in the minds of the people with the people's enemies—the feudal class. The latter is a problem of struggle against the enemy, which must be eliminated by coercion; the former is a problem of ideological transformation within the people, which must be carried out by democratic education. Among the problems within the people, we must never confuse the general violation of the Marriage Law with the serious criminal acts of killing and injuring people in marriage matters. The general violation of the Marriage Law among the people is the evil result of the long-term influence of the feudal marriage system, which in China at present is large in number and involves a wide range of people. For this kind of problem, we must adhere to the education policy, adopt an attitude of care, unity, and helping to correct, and carry out patient education and appropriate criticism, so that they can automatically correct their shortcomings and improve their relationships on the basis of raising awareness. If this policy is violated, mistakes will inevitably be made. For the very few serious criminal acts of killing and injuring people, they must be severely punished and sanctioned according to law, otherwise, it will confuse right and wrong and relax discipline; but this punishment must be combined with educating the broad masses of people, so that they know that the people's government will never allow such barbaric behavior to continue to exist. Therefore, clearly dividing the internal and external boundaries and policy boundaries and adhering to the education policy in the campaign to implement the Marriage Law has become the key to the success or failure of the movement. This important experience was gradually clarified in the process of the movement's practice. In the typical experiment work, many comrades were not clear about the division of these boundaries and did not understand the adherence to the education policy, so they held hasty emotions and used the methods of fighting against the enemy to solve the problems within the people, which caused panic and unease among the masses and created some social chaos, separating them from the people. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued supplementary instructions to quickly correct it, the movement was able to develop smoothly and healthily.

The experience in this campaign to implement the Marriage Law proves that the Marriage Law must be promoted to the people in connection with their vital interests, starting from their existing level, adapting to the laws of their ideological development, patiently persuading and gradually improving them to achieve the expected goal. The ideological laws of the people are generally: initially, they have concerns and misunderstandings about implementing the Marriage Law, then they hope to understand the content of the Marriage Law, and finally, they demand to solve specific problems in marriage and family. Due to insufficient past publicity and education work, the people have various incorrect understandings and emotions about the campaign to implement the Marriage Law and the Marriage Law itself: some are afraid of the movement; some are watching the movement; some, although looking forward to the movement, are active and enthusiastic, but blindly optimistic, simple and hasty. These incorrect understandings and emotions are a great obstacle to the implementation of the Marriage Law. Therefore, publicity and education work must first start from the places that are easily accepted by the broad masses of people, explain the purpose, principles, and policies of the movement, and focus on explaining the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, such as Hubei Province introducing that a county's publicity of the Marriage Law first starts from family harmony and united production, saying that the purpose of implementing the Marriage Law is to achieve family harmony and united production, but to achieve this goal, the system of arranged and bought marriages must be abolished, and it must be a voluntary combination of men and women, and there must be equality, mutual respect, and love between men and women, and parents-in-law must be respected and daughters-in-law must be loved. This makes them realize that implementing the Marriage Law is beneficial to men, women, old and young, to families, and to society, in order to reduce misunderstandings about the Marriage Law. Secondly, after the emotions of the masses have initially stabilized, the Marriage Law should be explained to the masses in an all-round way, that is, freedom of marriage should be talked about, and at the same time, the serious and cautious attitude towards handling marriage problems should be talked about, guaranteeing freedom of marriage should also be talked about guaranteeing freedom of divorce, and protecting the interests of women and children should also be talked about respecting and supporting parents and parents-in-law, so that men, women, old and young can have a correct understanding of the Marriage Law from the perspective of their vital interests. Thirdly, further adopt the methods of "calculating accounts" and "getting to the root" to deeply solve ideological problems, such as the successful experience of Hebei Province in this regard: first, calculate the account of how family disharmony affects production, dig out the roots of patriarchal rule and husband rule, and establish the concept of democratic harmony and united production; second, calculate the account of whether women can do it (the value of women's family labor and production), dig out the roots of male superiority and female inferiority, and establish the concept of equality between men and women; third, calculate the account of why couples are not harmonious, and why some people commit suicide or are killed due to unfree marriage, dig out the roots of feudal arranged, bought, and forced marriages, and establish the concept of freedom of marriage. Finally, it is necessary to combine publicity and education work with commending models and correctly handling marriage problems, so that the people can actually realize the great significance of implementing the Marriage Law from solving specific problems, and publicity can penetrate people's hearts. But the key to doing a good job in publicity lies in seriously training cadres who specifically implement the Marriage Law, especially grassroots cadres, and checking their implementation of the Marriage Law. Only through training and inspection can cadres clarify the significance of implementing the Marriage Law ideologically and master the policies for implementing the Marriage Law, so that they can correctly and comprehensively publicize the Marriage Law to the people.

Another important experience in the movement is that the implementation of the Marriage Law must be closely combined with production. Facts have proved that the implementation of the Marriage Law will not only not hinder production work but also be a driving force for promoting production. The leadership must clarify this issue and consciously guide the enthusiasm of the people in the campaign to implement the Marriage Law to production work in a timely manner. How to combine? Many experiences have proved that when discussing production issues, it should be linked to how to implement the Marriage Law to liberate productive forces. When discussing the implementation of the Marriage Law, it should be studied how it is conducive to the development of production. No matter how the work is carried out or how the time is arranged, it must be based on the principle of not hindering production. When publicizing the Marriage Law, using specific examples to analyze the different family relationships and different production situations under the old and new marriage systems is the easiest way to get through the masses' minds. In the activities of grassroots production organizations, attention should be paid at any time to discovering and solving the problems affecting production due to marriage, criticizing the feudal ideas of discriminating against women and belittling women's labor, and gradually formulating a system of equal pay for equal work for men and women to improve women's economic status. As long as the campaign to implement the Marriage Law is closely combined with production work, it can win the support of the broad masses of people and make the movement lively and vigorously developed.

III. Opinions on the Future Work of Implementing the Marriage Law

Abolishing the feudal marriage system and establishing a new marriage system is a long-term and arduous process of ideological education and social reform for the people. We must neither be hasty and rash nor let it go unchecked. Therefore, we should maintain a clear mind, seriously look at this work, correctly estimate the achievements of this movement, and not be complacent and paralyzed in the slightest. We must shift the implementation of the Marriage Law to regular work and continue to consolidate and develop the achievements of this movement. To this end, the following suggestions are made:

(1) People's governments at all levels, civil affairs and judicial departments, and people's organizations such as women's, youth, and trade unions should list the work of implementing the Marriage Law as one of their regular tasks, and conscientiously lead, regularly deploy, and inspect it. The leading principle of future work should be to consolidate and develop the first type of area, promote the second type of area, and drive the third type of area. To this end, the strength of the activists who emerged in the movement must be fully utilized to continue to publicize the Marriage Law through them, and they should be planned to be trained and promoted to participate in the work of marriage registration in district people's governments and mediation committees in townships (villages). At the same time, the education of cadres, especially grassroots cadres, should be grasped tightly. For cadres who still do not understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and do not know how to help the people solve marriage-related problems after this movement, appropriate time should be selected to conduct education by checking the implementation of the Marriage Law and summarizing the experience of this work to improve their understanding and work confidence. It is necessary to combine the central work of production and construction and elections, continue to publicize the Marriage Law in a focused and in-depth manner, correctly handle the people's marriage disputes, commend model examples and model figures of freedom of marriage and family harmony, and eliminate the people's concerns and doubts.

(2) Establish and strengthen the regular work of publicizing the Marriage Law. The political and legal, cultural and educational departments of people's governments at all levels should regularly study the publicity work related to the Marriage Law, formulate a work plan for regular publicity, and establish an inspection system. And according to the experience and rich materials of this movement, compile various publicity materials and widely publicize them. In the future period, political and legal schools at all levels and cadre training classes of trade unions, youth, women, and other departments, district, township (village) cadres and primary school teachers training classes, mass night schools, and winter schools should list the Marriage Law as one of the political courses; when senior high schools and above study policies, the content of marriage policies should also be appropriately increased.

(3) Strengthen the marriage registration system and the work of township (village) mediation committees. County and district people's governments must attach importance to marriage registration work, establish marriage registration agencies in district people's governments, and designate special personnel to be responsible. In addition to correctly carrying out the registration work in accordance with marriage policies, the personnel handling marriage registration should also publicize the Marriage Law to the people and improve their understanding of marriage policies and regulations. People's courts at all levels above the county level should correctly and timely hear marriage cases. In the future, divorce cases should be judged by the courts as much as possible, except for those who voluntarily divorce and register for divorce with the government. People's governments and people's courts at all levels must actively inspect and punish criminal acts of killing and injuring women in accordance with the law, and consciously select various educational marriage cases to carry out publicity and education to the people; for general marriage disputes among the people, they must lead the township (village) mediation committees to seriously carry out mediation, which must abide by the principles of voluntary parties and conformity with marriage policies, and effectively prevent subjective and commanding phenomena such as forced mediation and unprincipled reconciliation.

(4) In order to consolidate the results of this movement and smoothly transition to regular work, the Marriage Law Implementation Committees at all levels should transfer this work to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government and civil affairs departments at all levels for management; but in order to continue to carry out large-scale publicity activities on the Marriage Law before and after the Spring Festival next year, the Marriage Law Implementation Committees and their offices at all levels should be retained, but the number of personnel in the offices can be reduced as appropriate, and the main task is to prepare for the next publicity.

    中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会
    关于贯彻婚姻法运动的总结报告
    （一九五三年十一月十一日中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会刘景范副主任在政务院第一百九十三次政务会议上的  报告，并经同次会议批准）
    总理、副总理、各位委员、各位同志：
    自一九五○年中华人民共和国婚姻法公布以后，新的婚姻关系和家庭关系即日益发展，封建的婚姻关系和家庭关系即开始受到批评和打击。一九五一年冬，中央和地方政法各有关部门，曾对婚姻法执行情况在部分地区进行过一次检查，起了一定的推动作用。但婚姻法在全国各地贯彻的情况是很不平衡的，在大部分地区，不但是人民群众，而且有不少政府工作人员，由于对他们没有进行认真的宣传教育和检查，他们对婚姻法很不了解或有很多误解，甚至还有抗拒情绪。因此，婚姻不自由，妇女受公婆与丈夫的虐待、迫害，甚至因此而自杀或被杀的现象仍然严重的存在。鉴于这种情况，始决定今年三月在全国范围内（除少数民族地区和土改未完成地区外）开展一次贯彻婚姻法运动。这次贯彻婚姻法运动已于四、五月份在全国各地先后结束了。今天，我代表中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会向政务院政务会议提出关于贯彻婚姻法运动的总结报告。是否有当？请予审核。
    一、情况与收获
    各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会根据中共中央和中央人民政府政务院关于贯彻婚姻法的指示，即开始进行了运动的准备工作。于今年一、二月间，先后在全国各农村、工矿、街道进行了二千七百二十六个典型试验，训练了三百四十七万余基层干部和大批宣传员及人民群众中的积极分子。并颁发了贯彻婚姻法宣传提纲，印发了二千多万份宣传婚姻法的各种宣传品，利用报纸、刊物、画报、连环画和报告、座谈、广播、说唱、戏剧、幻灯、电影等方式，于今年三、四月份陆续在全国范围的百分之七十左右的地区内向广大人民群众展开了宣传。在典型试验中，各地曾发生过程度不同的急躁冒进的偏差，经发现即加以纠正，使运动纳入正规，稳步前进，获得应有的成绩。
    这次运动，一方面是自婚姻法颁布以来第一次在全国范围内有系统地普遍地宣传了婚姻法，有系统地揭发与批判了人们在婚姻问题上的封建思想和封建恶习，检查了县以上各级法院、民政部门主管婚姻事务的人员及区、乡（村）政府干部执行婚姻法的情况。另一方面是根据中央贯彻婚姻法的政策，正确地处理了许多婚姻问题。这就是：对因封建婚姻制度所造成的家庭不民主不和睦现象，采取了说服教育的办法，号召他们自觉的改善，获得广大人民群众的拥护。在这次运动中，各地都有成千成万的人们因不满他们的封建家庭关系，纷纷起来要求改善。他们采取开家庭民主会议等办法，婆婆、丈夫和媳妇互相检讨，改正错误，其中有许多还订立了互敬互爱的公约。对夫妻关系十分恶劣，无法继续共同生活的，经劝解无效，批准了他们的离婚要求。对那些杀害、伤害妇女的罪犯，进行了检查并由人民司法机关处以应得的刑罚。对要求解除童养关系的童养媳，批准了他们的要求。对合乎婚姻法规定而要求结婚的青年男女，发给了他们结婚登记证。这些正确的措施，不仅严重地打击了在婚姻问题上的封建思想，而且有力地支持了人民群众争取婚姻自由的正义斗争。因而社会风气有了很大转变，实行婚姻自由与男女权利平等，已逐渐扩大了社会舆论的同情，包办儿女婚事和虐待妇女的行为，已逐渐遭受到社会舆论的反对。各地反映，在贯彻婚姻法运动以后，民主和睦的新式家庭大批出现，要求自由结婚的青年男女到区、乡政府登记的人数有了显著的增加，虐待妇女特别是杀害、伤害妇女的现象普遍的减少，有些地区已停止了这种现象的发生。
    当广大人民群众在获得婚姻自由，夫妻、婆媳关系改善以后，他们参加社会活动尤其是参加生产的积极性就更加提高。许多从来不参加社会活动的妇女，现在也与男人一样参加了各种社会活动，并涌现出大批积极分子，参加了基层政府和妇代会、人代会以及生产互助组织的工作。贯彻婚姻法运动较为深入的农村和厂矿，广大男女群众的生产热情空前高涨，生产效率有显著提高。这些事实又教育了广大人民群众，使他们更深刻地体会到封建婚姻制度不仅是束缚妇女的锁链，而且是发展生产的障碍，他们说：“越封建，越争吵，越蹩扭，越没劲劳动”；“越民主，越和睦，越痛快，劳动劲头越大”。因而就更加拥护婚姻法，更加努力生产，出现了团结、和睦、愉快和热情劳动的新气象。
    这次运动，也教育了各级人民政府的干部，使他们进一步明确了贯彻婚姻法的重大意义，认识了贯彻婚姻法工作的长期性、复杂性、艰巨性和坚持教育方针的重要性，特别是教育和锻炼了广大的基层干部，批判了他们对婚姻法的错误认识，纠正了干部干涉婚姻自由和漠视人民群众疾苦的现象，加强了他们执行婚姻法的责任感和群众观点，并在运动中涌现出大批贯彻婚姻法的模范干部，给今后继续贯彻婚姻法打下了基础。
    但是上述成绩还不是普遍的。从全国范围来看，运动的广度和深度都是不平衡的。即在一个省、一个县、一个区的范围内也都是参差不齐，有好有差。大体上可分为三种类型：第一类型：按照中央指示作到了普遍深入。干部划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限，积极支持婚姻自由，并能按照婚姻法的基本精神来处理人民的婚姻问题；人民中百分之八十至九十的成年人受到教育；婚姻自由、男女权利平等、家庭民主和睦的新风气开始树立，成为今后贯彻婚姻法的阵地。这种地区约占百分之十五左右。第二类型：大部分干部划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限；人民中百分之六十至七十的成年人受到教育，对家庭和睦、团结生产很拥护，旧婚姻习惯已被冲淡，新婚姻制度开始实行，但其中有一部分人对婚姻自由、男女权利平等还有某些顾虑和怀疑；
  一部分夫妻、婆媳关系有了初步改善，但虐待杀害妇女的事件还不能完全停止。这种地区约占百分之六十左右。第三类型：干部和人民对婚姻法仅有粗浅认识，还有许多怀疑与误解；妇女自杀和被杀现象仍然严重存在。这种地区约占百分之二十五左右。由此可见，这次贯彻婚姻法运动，不仅进行贯彻婚姻法运动的地区不普遍，即在进行贯彻婚姻法运动的地区内还不是也不可能普遍地做到了深入。因此，这仅仅是为今后贯彻婚姻法的工作造成了良好的开端，要彻底地解决问题还有待于继续努力。
    二、几点主要经验
    从这次贯彻婚姻法运动中使我们深深体会到，我国的封建势力虽然在政治上和经济上已被打垮，但由于我国经济文化落后，广大人民群众在几千年封建统治的影响下，在许多社会习惯上仍保有封建思想和封建意识，而婚姻问题上的封建思想和封建意识则是其中较普遍而严重的一种。封建婚姻制度及其影响下的封建思想，不仅造成了家庭尤其妇女的很大痛苦，而且对新社会经济文化的发展也有很大障碍。因此，贯彻实行婚姻法，不只是广大青年男女尤其妇女群众的迫切要求，符合于全体人民群众的切身利益，且有利于国家的经济、文化建设事业。事实证明，凡是真正实行了婚姻法的地方，那里便出现无数民主和睦的新家庭，人们就愉快地积极地参加社会活动和生产建设，社会就出现一片新的气象。凡未实行婚姻法的地方，那里许多人的婚姻与家庭问题得不到解决，家庭不和睦，妇女受虐待的现象普遍存在，甚至发生死人现象。有些同志，不了解贯彻婚姻法的重大意义，对贯彻婚姻法抱冷淡和抵触情绪，这显然是错误的。列宁教导我们说，两性关系，家庭问题，绝对不是个人的私事或生活的小节，而是有重大社会意义的事情。所以贯彻婚姻法的工作应当成为当前各级人民政府和全国人民的一项重要的政治任务。
    从这次贯彻婚姻法运动的经验教训中，使我们更明确地认识了婚姻制度的改革完全是人民内部事情的这一性质，以及当解决这一人民内部的错综复杂的婚姻问题时，只有坚持教育的方针才是最正确的方针。毛主席教导我们说：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”我们决不能把对待人民头脑中的封建思想、封建习惯与对待人民敌人——封建阶级混同起来。后者是对敌斗争问题，要用强制消灭的办法；前者是人民内部的思想改造问题，要用民主教育的办法。在人民内部问题之中，我们也决不能把对待一般违犯婚姻法行为与对待在婚姻问题上极少数杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯罪行为混同起来。人民中一般违犯婚姻法行为是封建婚姻制度长期影响的恶果，这在中国目前的情况下，数量很大，牵涉很广。对待这一类问题，必须坚持教育方针，采用爱护、团结和帮助改正的态度，进行耐心的教育和适当的批评，使他们在提高觉悟的基础上，自动地改正缺点，改善关系，如果违背这个方针，必然要犯错误。对于极少数杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯罪行为，则必须严厉惩办，依法制裁，否则就要混淆是非，松弛法纪；但这种惩办必须与教育广大人民群众结合起来，使他们知道人民政府决不容许这种野蛮行为继续存在。因此，在贯彻婚姻法运动中明确划分内外界限与政策界限，坚持教育方针，就成为运动成败的关键。这一重要经验，是我们在运动的实践过程中逐渐明确起来的，在典型试验工作中，曾有不少同志对这些界限划分不清，对坚持教育方针认识不够，因而抱着急躁情绪，搬用对敌斗争的办法，来解决人民内部的问题，以致引起群众恐慌不安，造成了一些社会混乱，脱离了人民群众。经中共中央发布补充指示迅速纠正后，才使运动顺利地健康地向前发展。
    这次贯彻婚姻法运动中的经验证明：向人民群众宣传婚姻法，必须结合他们的切身利益，从他们现有水平出发，适应着他们思想发展的规律，循循善诱，逐步提高，才能达到预期的目的。人民群众的思想规律一般是：开始时对贯彻婚姻法存有顾虑和误解，进而希望了解婚姻法的内容，最后要求解决婚姻和家庭方面的具体问题。由于过去的宣传教育工作不够，人民群众对贯彻婚姻法运动和婚姻法本身有各种不正确的认识和情绪：有的是怕运动；有的是看运动；有的虽是盼运动，积极热情，但盲目乐观，简单急躁。这些不正确的认识和情绪，是贯彻婚姻法的极大障碍。因而宣传教育工作首先是要从广大人民群众容易接受的地方入手，讲明运动的目的和方针、政策，并着重解释婚姻法的基本精神，如湖北省介绍某县宣传婚姻法时先从家庭和睦、团结生产着手，说贯彻婚姻法是要达到家庭和睦、团结生产的目的，但要达到此目的就必须废除包办买卖婚姻制度，必须由男女双方自愿结合，必须男女平等，互敬互爱，必须尊婆爱媳。使他们认识贯彻婚姻法对男女老幼，对家庭，对社会都有好处，以减少对婚姻法的误解。其次，在群众情绪初步稳定之后，就要向群众全面讲解婚姻法，即讲婚姻自由，同时要讲对处理婚姻问题的严肃慎重态度，讲保障结婚自由也要讲保障离婚自由，讲保护妇女、子女的利益也要讲尊敬扶养父母翁婆，由此使男女老幼都能从切身利害关系上对婚姻法获得正确了解。再次，更进一步地采取“算账”、“刨根”的办法，深入解决思想问题，即如河北省在这方面的成功经验：一算家庭不和影响生产的账，刨掉家长统治、夫权统治的根子，树立民主和睦、团结生产的观点；二算妇女行不行的账（妇女的家庭劳动生产的价值），刨掉男尊女卑的根子，树立男女平等的观点；三算夫妇为什么不和睦，为什么有些人因婚姻不自由而自杀、被杀的账，刨掉封建包办、买卖和强迫婚姻的根子，树立婚姻自由的观点。最后，必须把宣传教育工作和表扬模范及正确处理婚姻问题等工作结合起来，使人民群众从解决具体问题中实际体会到贯彻婚姻法的重大意义，宣传才能深入人心。但做好宣传工作的关键，主要在于认真地训练具体执行婚姻法的干部特别是基层干部，并检查他们执行婚姻法的情况。只有通过训练和检查，使干部在思想上明确了贯彻婚姻法的意义，掌握了执行婚姻法的政策，才能够正确地全面地向人民群众宣传婚姻法。
    运动中的另一个重要经验是贯彻婚姻法必须紧密结合生产。事实证明，贯彻婚姻法不仅不会妨碍生产工作，而且是推进生产的动力。领导上必须把这个问题弄明确，有意识地把人民群众在贯彻婚姻法运动中的热情及时引导到生产工作中去。如何结合？许多经验证明：在讨论生产问题时，应联系如何贯彻婚姻法以解放生产力，在讨论贯彻婚姻法问题时，应研究如何有利于发展生产，无论工作的进行，或时间的安排，都必须以不妨害生产为原则。在宣传婚姻法时，运用具体事例，分析新旧婚姻制度下所产生的不同的家庭关系与不同的生产情况，最容易打通群众的思想。在基层生产组织的活动中，应随时注意发现与解决因婚姻影响生产的问题，批判歧视妇女、轻视妇女劳动的封建思想，并逐步订定男女同劳同酬的制度，提高妇女的经济地位。只要将贯彻婚姻法运动与生产工作密切的结合起来，就能获得广大人民群众的拥护，就能使运动生动有力的开展。
    三、对今后贯彻婚姻法工作的意见
    废除封建婚姻制度和树立新婚姻制度，是一个长期的艰巨的对人民群众的思想教育和社会改革的过程。既不能急躁冒进，更不能放任自流。因此，我们应当保持清醒的头脑，严肃地看待这个工作，正确估计这次运动的成绩，丝毫也不能自满麻痹。我们必须把贯彻婚姻法转入经常工作，使这次运动的成绩继续巩固与发展。为此，特提出以下各项建议：
    （一）各级人民政府民政、司法部门和妇女、青年、工会等人民团体，应将贯彻婚姻法工作列为经常任务之一，认真领导，定期布置和检查。今后工作的领导方针，应该是巩固与发展第一类地区，促进第二类地区，带动第三类地区。为此，必须充分发挥运动中涌现出来的积极分子的力量，通过他们继续进行贯彻婚姻法的宣传，并有计划地培养与提拔他们参加区人民政府婚姻登记和乡（村）调解委员会的工作。同时，应抓紧干部尤其是基层干部的教育工作。对于经过这次运动还不懂得婚姻法基本精神，还不会帮助人民群众解决有关婚姻问题的干部，要选择适当时间，采取检查婚姻法执行情况和总结这项工作经验的办法，进行教育，提高他们的认识和工作信心。必须结合生产建设和选举等中心工作，有重点地继续深入地宣传婚姻法，正确地处理人民的婚姻纠纷，表扬婚姻自由、家庭和睦的模范事例和模范人物，消除人民群众的顾虑与怀疑。
    （二）建立和加强宣传婚姻法的经常工作。各级人民政府的政法、文教部门，应定期研究有关婚姻法的宣传工作，制订经常宣传的工作计划和检查制度。并根据这次运动的经验和丰富材料，编写各种宣传品，广泛宣传。在今后一定时期内，各级政法学校与工会、青年、妇女等部门的干部训练班，区、乡（村）干部及小学教员训练班，民众夜校和冬学等应将婚姻法列为政治课程之一；高级中学以上学校学习政策时，也应适当增加婚姻政策的内容。
    （三）加强婚姻登记制度和乡（村）调解委员会的工作。县、区人民政府必须重视婚姻登记工作，建立区人民政府婚姻登记机构，指定专人负责。办理婚姻登记的人员除正确地按照婚姻政策进行登记工作外，并应向人民群众宣传婚姻法，提高他们对婚姻政策、法令的认识。县以上的各级人民法院应正确地、及时地审理婚姻案件。今后的离婚案件除男女双方自愿离婚者在政府登记离婚外，应尽可能由法院判处。各级人民政府和人民法院对于杀害、伤害妇女的犯罪行为，必须主动检查，依法制裁，并有意识地选择各种有教育意义的婚姻案件向人民群众进行宣传教育；凡人民群众中一般的婚姻纠纷，必须领导乡（村）调解委员会认真进行调解，调解必须遵守当事人自愿及合乎婚姻政策的原则，要切实防止强迫调解和无原则地说合等主观主义和命令主义现象。
    （四）为了巩固这次运动的成果，并很好地转入经常工作，各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会应即将此项工作移交中央内务部和各级民政部门掌管；但为了在明年春节前后继续进行大规模的宣传婚姻法运动起见，各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会及其办公室应予保留，但办公室的人数可酌量减少，主要任务是进行下次宣传的准备工作。（新华社）
