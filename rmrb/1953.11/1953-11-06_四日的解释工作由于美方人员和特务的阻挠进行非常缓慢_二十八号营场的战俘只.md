Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 4th: The Korean-Chinese side conducted explanations to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp 28 on the 4th. Camp 28 is a camp under extremely terrifying special agent rule. It was the Kuomintang special agents in this camp who beat to death a prisoner of war named Zhang Zilong, who requested to return to his country, disemboweled him, dug out his heart, and burned the body to destroy the evidence.

Since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission investigated the Zhang Zilong murder case, the special agents have intensified their terrorist threats against the prisoners of war. Every prisoner of war who came to the explanation tent on the 4th showed a look of terror. Zhang Zilong's experience was threatening them. They all muttered the words the special agents forced them to say, and, just as the special agents had forced them to rehearse in the camp, they made noise and trouble in the explanation tent. The special agent elements shouted and jumped wildly, some even throwing stones at the explanation representatives, and even trying to take off their American military boots to hit the explanation representatives. After a period of noise, some special agents said to the U.S. "Detaining Power Representative": "Representative of the United Nations Forces, didn't you say it would be 20 or 30 minutes, why don't you call them away?"

While the explanation work was underway on the 4th, Hansen, the advisor to Hamblen, the head of the U.S. "Anti-Repatriation" group, and the head of the Psychological Warfare Department of the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo, personally came to the explanation site to inspect the execution of his "plan." Everyone knows that Hansen personally arranged plans to sabotage the explanations in prisoner of war camps such as Jeju Island and Nonsan. Several U.S. military personnel were also stationed on the road outside the "application for repatriation" door at the second explanation site, threatening prisoners of war who wanted to return home.

In the explanation tents, the U.S. "observer representatives" were replaced by Kuomintang special agents again today. In Tent 31, a "Detaining Power Representative" violated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" and openly interrupted our explanation representative's explanation to the prisoners of war. In Tent 20, the Kuomintang special agent acting as "translator" constantly shook his head at those listening to the explanation. In Tent 12, Major Ryan, the U.S. "Detaining Power Representative," even kicked our observer representative and deliberately left the tent with the Kuomintang special agent "observer representative" to obstruct the explanation.

While the explanation work was underway, the Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary bodies constantly raised "opinions," causing the explanations to be interrupted repeatedly; Swedish members in some tents also did the same. The "reasons" they requested to interrupt the explanations were almost the same. They insisted that the time our representatives spent explaining to the prisoners of war was "too long," that it was a "violation of the Geneva Convention" and "humanitarian principles," that it was "mental torture," or that "I don't think this prisoner of war needs an explanation." In Tent 20, due to the unreasonable obstruction of the Swiss and Swedish members, the explanation was interrupted seven times in the two hours from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., one of which lasted 44 minutes, which was more than the total of 40 minutes of actual explanation time in the morning. In Tent 20, due to the proposal of the Swiss and Swedish members, although the Polish and Czechoslovakian members opposed it, the chairman of the subsidiary body took the prisoners of war who had not finished listening to the explanation away at 4:30 p.m., ending the explanation work. According to the regulations, 5:00 p.m. was the time to end the explanations. In Tent 14, after a prisoner of war made a fuss and then became quiet, the explanation representative patiently explained to him. However, the Swiss and Swedish members said that this prisoner of war who was listening quietly was tired and asked the chairman of the subsidiary body not to allow the explanation representative to continue the explanation. The Polish and Czechoslovakian members did not agree with this opinion. However, this prisoner of war who had not finished listening to the explanation was taken out of the explanation tent. According to preliminary information obtained by reporters, in only four tents, Nos. 22, 23, 27, and 29, seven prisoners of war were taken away without finishing the explanation under the same circumstances.

Under heavy obstruction and threats, the fear caused by the long-term special agent terror in the hearts of the prisoners of war cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. When one prisoner of war who applied for repatriation today first entered the tent, he also shouted as usual. After the explanation representative explained to him that he could apply for repatriation in the tent, he asked him: "Do you want to return to your country now?" The prisoner of war said: "The squad leader told us that we all have to return to Taiwan." However, after the explanation representative repeatedly told him not to be afraid, he said that he wanted to return to his hometown in Sichuan. The explanation representative also told him that no one could harm him when he requested repatriation, and that he could be repatriated on the same day. Only then did he muster the courage to come out of the "application for repatriation" door. Another prisoner of war did not dare to express anything after listening to the explanation for two hours in the morning. After being isolated and watched separately, he applied for repatriation after the explanation continued in the afternoon. The above two prisoners of war have already been repatriated back to Panmunjom tonight. The application for repatriation of another prisoner of war has not yet been approved by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The explanation work today proceeded extremely slowly. Due to the obstruction and sabotage of U.S. personnel and special agents, only 202 prisoners of war listened to an explanation under severe terror. More than 200 prisoners of war are still waiting to listen to the explanation. According to the provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," these two types of prisoners of war should be guarded separately. Otherwise, it will be impossible to guarantee that the remaining prisoners of war will not be replaced by special agents, thereby being deprived of their right to listen to the explanation.

According to the report of our non-military zone civil police in Dongchang-ri, at about 9:00 p.m. on the 4th, they heard Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in the camp broadcasting to the prisoners of war with loudspeakers, ordering the prisoners of war not to listen to what the explanation representatives said tomorrow, and saying: "Today, one person did not perform well, we will deal with him!" Our broadcasts to the prisoners of war have been met with many obstacles, but Chiang Kai-shek's special agents were able to use loudspeakers in the camp to sabotage the explanation work. This extremely abnormal phenomenon shows that not only has Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organization not been eliminated, but also their terrorist rule and sabotage activities have been intensified.

### 四日的解释工作由于美方人员和特务的阻挠进行非常缓慢  二十八号营场的战俘只

    四日的解释工作由于美方人员和特务的阻挠进行非常缓慢
    二十八号营场的战俘只有一半人听了解释
    【新华社开城四日电】四日朝中方面对第二十八号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。第二十八号营场是一个特务统治极其恐怖的营场，就是这个营场的国民党特务们，曾经把一个要求回国的战俘张子龙活活打死，剖腹挖心，并焚尸灭迹。
    自从中立国遣返委员会调查谋害张子龙事件后，特务们更加强了对战俘的恐怖威胁。四日到解释帐篷来的每一个战俘都面呈恐怖之色，张子龙的遭遇在威胁着他们。他们都念念有词地喊叫着特务们强迫他们说的话，并且按照特务们在营场里强迫排演时那样，到解释帐篷里又吵又闹。特务分子则狂喊狂跳，有的特务分子并向解释代表扔石头，甚至要想脱掉美军皮靴来打解释代表。有些特务吵闹一阵以后就对美方“拘留方代表”说：“联合国军代表，不是说二、三十分钟吗，怎么不叫走呀？”
    四日解释工作进行时，美方“反对”遣返组组长汉布伦的顾问、东京美军总部心理作战处负责人汉生亲自到解释场所来视察他的“计划”的执行情形。谁都知道，汉生亲自在济州岛、论山等战俘营布置过破坏解释的计划。在第二解释场所申请遣返的门外的道路上，也站着几个美军人员，使表示想要回家的战俘受到威胁。
    在解释帐篷中，美方的“观察代表”今天又都换成了国民党特务。在第三十一号帐篷，一个“拘留方代表”违反“解释和访问工作细则”，公然插言打断我方解释代表向战俘的解释。在第二十号帐篷，充当“翻译”的国民党特务也不断向听解释者摇头示意。在第十二号帐篷，美方“拘留方代表”莱恩少校甚至用脚踢我方观察代表，并和国民党特务的“观察代表”一起故意退出帐篷，阻挠解释。
    当解释工作正在进行时，中立国遣返委员会附属机构的瑞士委员也不断提出“意见”，使解释一再中断；有的帐篷中瑞典委员也这样做。他们要求中断解释的“理由”几乎是相同的。他们硬说我方代表对战俘进行解释的时间“太长”，是“违反日内瓦公约”和“人道原则”，是什么“精神上的折磨”，或者说“我看对这个战俘用不着解释了”。在第二十号帐篷，由于瑞士委员和瑞典委员的无理阻挠，在上午九时半到十一时半的两小时解释中，被打断了七次，其中有一次达四十四分钟，比上午实际进行解释的时间的总和四十分钟还多。在第二十号帐篷内，由于瑞士和瑞典委员的提议，虽然波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员反对，附属机构主席还是在四点半钟就把没有听完解释的战俘带走，终止了解释工作。而根据规定，五时才是终止解释的时间。在第十四号帐篷中，一个战俘吵闹以后变为安静，解释代表就耐心地向他解释。可是瑞士和瑞典委员却说这个安静听取解释的战俘疲倦了，要求附属机构主席不让解释代表继续解释。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员不同意这个意见。可是，这个尚未听完解释的战俘就被带出了解释帐篷。据记者初步获知，仅在第二十二、二十三、二十七、二十九号等四个帐篷就有七个战俘在同样情况下还没有听完解释就被带走。
    在重重阻挠和威胁之下，长期的特务恐怖在战俘心中造成的疑惧根本不可能在短时间内解除。今天申请遣返的一个战俘刚进入帐篷时也照样嚷叫，当解释代表向他说明在帐篷内就可以申请遣返后，问他：“你现在回国吗？”这个战俘说：“班长对我们说，都要回台湾。”但是，当解释代表一再要他不用害怕，他才说他想回四川家乡。解释代表又告诉他，要回国就走“申请遣返”的门，瑞士和瑞典委员忽然同时站起来阻止解释代表讲话，使这个战俘重新又犹豫了一下，又说开了“回台湾”。这时，解释代表又庄严地告诉他，他要求遣返时谁都不能伤害他，并且可以在当天遣返。这样，他才壮着胆从“申请遣返”的门出来了。另外一个战俘在上午听了两个小时解释还不敢表示什么，经单独隔离看管，下午继续解释以后才申请遣返。以上两名战俘今晚已经遣返回到板门店，另一名战俘要求遣返的申请尚未经中立国遣返委员会批准生效。
    今天的解释工作进行得极为缓慢，由于美方人员和特务的阻挠、破坏，只有二百零二名战俘在严重的恐怖笼罩下听了一次解释，尚有二百多名战俘尚待听取解释。根据“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定，这两类战俘应分别看管，否则，将无法保证其余的战俘不由特务来顶替，从而被剥夺了听取解释的权利。
    据东场里我方非军事区民政警察报告，四日夜九时许，他们听到营场里蒋匪特务竟用扩音器向战俘广播，命令战俘明天不要听解释代表讲的话，并说：“今天有一个人表现不好，我们要处理他！”我方向战俘进行广播一直遭到许多阻碍，而蒋匪特务竟能利用营场中的扩音器破坏解释工作。这种极端反常的现象表明蒋匪特务组织不仅没有被清除，而且他们的恐怖统治和破坏活动更加加紧了。
