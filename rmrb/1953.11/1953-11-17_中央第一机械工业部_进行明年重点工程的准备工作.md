    The Central First Ministry of Machine-Building is currently drafting the basic construction plan for 1954 and actively preparing for next year's key projects.
    Next year marks the second year of China's Five-Year Plan for economic construction, and the tasks of the machine-building industry will be more arduous and demanding than this year. In drafting the 1954 basic construction plan, the Central First Ministry of Machine-Building has firmly grasped the principle of focusing on key construction and advancing steadily. It has determined that, first and foremost, it will fully guarantee the construction of newly built and renovated factories designed with Soviet assistance. Whether in the allocation of investment, the determination of engineering projects, the calculation of the balance of design and construction forces, the ordering of equipment, or the training and allocation of cadre and labor reserves, the needs of these projects must be met first. Secondly, the Ministry will also focus on constructing a number of factories that must coordinate with and supplement the Soviet-designed projects. In addition, because these large-scale new or renovated enterprises cannot be officially put into production within a certain period, while at the same time it is necessary to meet the needs of national economic construction as much as possible, the Ministry has decided to proceed in two ways: first, to carry out some appropriate and necessary expansions where needed and possible, but the principle must be that the timeframe is short and the benefits are great; second, to reorganize existing enterprises and give full play to their potential capabilities.
    Next year, the Soviet Union will assist China in the construction of mechanical manufacturing enterprises. In addition to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, and the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, which began construction this year and will continue to be built on a larger scale next year, the Shenyang Electric Wire Factory and the Harbin Instrument Factory will also begin construction next year. Next year, the Soviet Union will also assist China in designing more mechanical manufacturing plants, including plants producing oil extraction equipment and coal mining equipment, medium-sized steel rolling and iron-smelting equipment, as well as automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, heavy-duty machine tool manufacturing plants, and so on. The construction of these factories will greatly improve China's technological level. At present, Soviet design experts have arrived successively. The Central First Ministry of Machine-Building and its subordinate professional bureaus have established working groups, with dedicated personnel responsible for coordinating with Soviet experts in three groups: site selection, design data, and product program. At the same time, the Ministry and its bureaus have transferred more than one hundred cadres to specialize in translation and other technical work. Currently, various preparations are underway. Soviet experts are going to various places to help select sites and propose product plans.

    中央第一机械工业部
    进行明年重点工程的准备工作
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部正着手编制一九五四年的基本建设计划，积极进行明年重点工程的准备工作。
    明年是我国经济建设五年计划的第二年，机械工业的建设任务将比今年更加艰巨和繁重。中央第一机械工业部在编制一九五四年基本建设计划中，紧紧掌握了重点建设、稳步前进的方针，确定：首先全力保证苏联帮助我国设计的新建厂和改建厂的建设。无论在分配投资、确定工程项目、计算平衡设计与施工力量、定购设备、干部与劳动后备力量的培养与分配等方面，都必须首先满足这些项目的需要。其次，该部还重点建设若干必须配合与补充苏联设计项目的工厂。此外，因为这些规模巨大的新建或改建企业在一定的期限内还不能正式投入生产，而同时又必须尽可能的满足国家经济建设的需要，该部决定从两方面着手进行：第一，在需要与可能的条件下，作一些适当与必要的扩建，但必须以期限短而收效大为原则；第二，整理现有企业，充分发挥其潜在能力。
    明年苏联帮助我国机械制造工业建设的企业，除了今年已开始施工的第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂和沈阳第一机床厂等明年继续更大规模的施工外，沈阳电线厂和哈尔滨仪表厂等两个工厂也将在明年开始施工。明年，苏联还将帮助我国更多的机械制造工厂进行设计，这些企业包括有生产采油设备及煤矿设备、中型轧钢及炼铁设备等厂，以及汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、重型工作母机制造厂等等。通过这些工厂的建设，将使我国的技术水平大大提高一步。现在，苏联设计专家已陆续到来，第一机械工业部和部属各专业局均已成立了工作组，由专人负责，分厂址选择、设计资料和产品方案等三个小组配合苏联专家进行工作，同时，部和各局又抽调了一百多名干部专门从事翻译和其他技术等工作。目前，各项准备工作正在紧张地进行中。苏联专家正分赴各地帮助选择厂址，拟产品方案。
