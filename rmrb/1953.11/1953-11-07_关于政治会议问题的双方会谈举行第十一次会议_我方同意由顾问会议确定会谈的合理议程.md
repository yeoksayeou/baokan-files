Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the two sides' talks on the issue of the Political Conference issued the following communique:

    On November 6th, the two sides held the eleventh meeting on the issue of the Political Conference. Mr. Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke first, raising our side's opinions on the US side's suggestion yesterday to hand over the issue of determining the agenda of the two sides' talks to the two sides' advisory conference for resolution. Mr. Ki Sok-bok pointed out that, due to the other side's stubborn and unreasonable attitude of erasing the issue of membership from the agenda, the two sides' talks, after ten days of discussion, still could not determine a reasonable agenda. Now, the other side finally admits that determining the agenda is an issue that must be resolved immediately by the two sides' talks. Since the other side has put forward this suggestion, the Korean-Chinese side, in the spirit of consistently advocating resolving issues through consultation, and in order to quickly determine a reasonable agenda to facilitate the progress of the two sides' talks, agrees to the other side's suggestion. At the same time, Mr. Ki Sok-bok declared that only if the other side abandons its unreasonable insistence on erasing the issue of membership can the advisory conference achieve results. If the advisory conference still cannot determine a reasonable agenda due to the other side's continued insistence on unreasonable demands, our side reserves the right to hand the agenda issue back to the two sides' representatives' meeting for resolution at any time. Our side also suggests that the advisory conference hold its first meeting at 11:00 a.m. on November 7th; during the advisory conference, the two sides' representatives' meeting will be adjourned until the advisory conference submits a report on the agenda issue to the representatives' meeting, or either side requests the termination of the advisory conference and the holding of a representatives' meeting. The US side agreed to our side's suggestion. The meeting then adjourned.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十一次会议
    我方同意由顾问会议确定会谈的合理议程
   【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月六日，双方关于政治会议问题的会谈举行第十一次会议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生首先发言，对美方昨日提出的将确定双方会谈议程的问题交由双方顾问会议去解决的建议提出我方意见。奇石福先生指出，由于对方固执其从议程上抹煞成员问题的无理态度，以致双方会谈经过十天的讨论，还不能确定一个合理的议程。现在，对方终于承认确定议程是双方会谈所必须立即解决的问题了。既然对方提出这一建议，朝中方面本着一贯主张经过协商解决问题的精神，为了迅速确定一个合理议程，以利双方会谈的进展，同意对方的此项建议。同时，奇石福先生声明，只有对方放弃抹煞成员问题的无理主张，才能使顾问会议获致结果。如顾问会议因对方继续坚持无理主张而仍然不能确定一个合理议程，则我方保留权利随时将议程问题交回双方代表会议解决。我方并建议顾问会议于十一月七日十一时举行第一次会议；在顾问会议期间，双方代表会议休会，直至顾问会议向代表会议提出关于议程问题的报告，或任何一方要求终止顾问会议而举行代表会议时为止。美方对我方建议表示同意。随即休会。
