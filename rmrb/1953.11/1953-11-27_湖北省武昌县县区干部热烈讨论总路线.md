    County and District Cadres in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, Enthusiastically Discuss the General Line

    Wuchang County, Hubei Province, convened an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres to study and enthusiastically discuss the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. The meeting began on November 6th and ended on the 16th. During the meeting, Liu Xiyao, First Deputy Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended and delivered an important report. Through listening to reports, presenting situations, and detailed accounting, the meeting broadened the horizons of the cadres present, cleared up various confused ideas, clarified the direction of work, and increased confidence in the work.

    Many cadres in Wuchang County and districts have lived in rural areas for a long time and have seen little or no large-scale industry. Therefore, they attach great importance to the development of agriculture but do not fully recognize the importance of the state concentrating its efforts on developing industry, especially heavy industry. Some cadres believe that agriculture should be developed first, more grain should be produced, and the steel produced by heavy industry cannot be eaten. Some believe that light industry requires less investment and generates more profits, so light industry should be developed first to accumulate funds, and then heavy industry should be developed.

    The meeting first focused on discussing the following issues: Without heavy industry, the machinery industry cannot develop, how can national defense be consolidated? Where do water pumps and tractors come from? Can agriculture be highly developed, and can the lives of farmers be further improved? Without heavy industry, can light industry develop? During the discussion of these issues, the cadres linked them to their actual life experiences and conducted in-depth analysis and research. District cadre Fu Sirun used the iron shovels used by farmers for production as an analogy. He said, "In the past, iron and coal were expensive, and buying a shovel required one stone of grain. Now that coal and iron production has increased, buying a shovel only requires five dou of grain. In the future, to manufacture tractors and implement agricultural socialization, heavy industry will be even more indispensable. Therefore, developing heavy industry first is beneficial to the people both now and in the future." They also discussed the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. They unanimously supported the state's方針 (fāngzhēn: policy) and steps to transition to socialism. Through discussions, they also gained a correct understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture.

    In their studies, they also exposed the harm of capitalist ideology and the spontaneous forces of peasants to the interests of farmers. For example, after the autumn harvest this year, a large number of private merchants lowered prices to buy grain from farmers and enticed cotton farmers to engage in commerce. In some villages, during drought-resistant production, agricultural production was affected because many farmers went into business. Some farmers lost all their capital in doing business. In Chunhe Township, District 7, some farmers did not participate in the production cooperatives, and not only did they harvest less grain, but the grain they harvested was bought at low prices by private merchants, suffering great losses. Some farmers sold their land to lend money at high interest rates; in Dalu Township alone, 32 farmers sold their land. This has already impoverished some individual farmers. Everyone believed that the farmers who participated in mutual aid groups and cooperatives were on the road to happiness. Because they were organized, they overcame various difficulties and produced more grain.

    They realized that the current work in rural areas must vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, guide farmers to organize, develop agricultural production, and at the same time enthusiastically sell grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction.

### 湖北省武昌县县区干部热烈讨论总路线

    湖北省武昌县县区干部热烈讨论总路线
    湖北省武昌县召开县区扩大干部会议，学习和热烈讨论了国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务。会议自十一月六日开始，到十六日结束。会议期间，中共湖北省委第一副书记刘西尧到会作了重要报告。会议经过听报告，摆情况，算细账，使到会干部的眼界打开了，打通了各种糊涂思想，明确了工作方向，并增加了工作信心。
    武昌县县区干部中，很多人都是长期生活在农村，很少或根本没有见过大工业，因此，他们对农业的发展很重视，而对国家为什么要集中力量发展工业，特别是重工业的重要性认识不足。有的干部认为：应该先发展农业，多打粮食，重工业生产的钢铁又不能吃。有的认为：轻工业投资少，赚钱多，可以先发展轻工业来积累资金，然后再发展重工业。
    会议首先就集中讨论了以下几个问题：没有重工业，机械工业就不能发展，国防怎能巩固？抽水机、拖拉机从那里来？农业不能高度发展，农民生活能不能得到进一步改善？没有重工业，轻工业能否得到发展？在讨论这些问题时，干部都联系实际生活经验，作了深入的分析和研究。区干部傅斯润拿农民生产用的铁锹作比喻，他说：“过去铁、煤都贵，买一把锹要一石谷，现在煤、铁生产多了，买一把锹只要五斗谷就够了。而将来要制拖拉机，实行农业社会主义化，没有重工业更不成。因此先发展重工业无论是目前和将来对人民都是有利的。”他们也讨论了农业和手工业的社会主义改造问题。他们一致拥护国家过渡到社会主义的方针和步骤。在讨论中，他们对工业和农业的关系也有了正确的认识。
    他们在学习中还揭发了资本主义思想和农民自发势力对农民利益的危害性。如今年秋收后大批私商压价把农民的粮食买去，并且引诱棉农经商。有的村子在抗旱生产时，由于有许多农民都去做生意，影响了农业生产。有的农民在做生意中把本钱都赔光了。七区春和乡有的农民因没有参加生产合作社，不但收粮少，收了粮又被私商低价买去，吃了大亏。有的农民把田卖了放高利贷，仅大路乡即有三十二户农民卖了田。这样已使一些个体农民开始贫困起来。大家认为参加了互助组和合作社的农民，是走了幸福的道路，他们由于组织起来了，克服了种种困难，多打了粮食。
    他们认识到目前农村中的工作，必需大力开展互助合作运动，引导农民组织起来，发展农业生产，同时要踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，以支援国家工业建设。　（新华社）
