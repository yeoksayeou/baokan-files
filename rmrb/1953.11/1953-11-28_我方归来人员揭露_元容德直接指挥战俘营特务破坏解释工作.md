Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: A secret directive from the Lee Syngman group intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces proves that the direct commander of the Lee bandit special agent organization in the Dongchang-ri POW camp was Lee bandit's Military Police Commander Won Yong-duk. Won Yong-duk personally orchestrated the incident in June of this year in which 27,000 North Korean People's Army prisoners of war were forcibly detained, extending the Korean War by more than a month. According to revelations from our returning personnel, before the captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side were sent to the demilitarized zone, Won Yong-duk personally went to the POW camp to arrange activities to sabotage the explanatory work.

Returning personnel Wen Chang-soo said: "On August 1st this year, I saw Won Yong-duk and several high-ranking American officers come to our camp and read Lee Syngman's threatening letter to the prisoners of war. Won Yong-duk also said that he was specially sent by Lee Syngman and told us to listen to him." Shortly after Won Yong-duk left, an American Major General who claimed to be in charge of transportation and an American Brigadier General who claimed to be in charge of the repatriation group came to the POW camp and made many arrangements to sabotage the explanatory work, and personally coerced the prisoners of war, telling them not to go home.

The intercepted secret instructions from the Lee bandit special agents said that the "chief" of the Dongchang-ri POW camp special agent command center, the "Unam-chon Anti-Communist Youth Corps," was located within Won Yong-duk's Military Police Command, with a "deputy chief" set up in each of "Geoje-ri," "Nonsan," and "Hospital." Returning personnel said that this meant that a "deputy chief" was set up in each of the three E, F, and G camp areas in Dongchang-ri. This is because most of the North Korean People's Army prisoners of war transferred from the original Geoje-ri and Busan POW camps to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp were in the E camp area; the prisoners of war from the American POW hospital were in the F camp area; and the prisoners of war from the Nonsan POW camp were in the G camp area. Won Yong-duk used this system to directly control the prisoners of war and intensify the heinous activities of commanding and sabotaging the explanatory work.

According to returning personnel, Han Eun-song, one of the recipients of the secret instructions, was a special agent who had been trained by the US-Lee bandit gang for a long time. Wen Chang-soo said that as early as April 1951, Han Eun-song was working under the command of the American intelligence agency "CIC." Wen Chang-soo often saw
  "CIC" jeeps taking Han Eun-song to the "CIC" organization in the camp to receive instructions for special agent activities. Han Eun-song also maintained frequent contact with the American military police headquarters and Lee bandit military police officers in the POW camp. Once, after Han Eun-song returned from the American military police headquarters, he said to his subordinates: "We are going to the neutral zone soon, and some people may not be reliable, so we must tattoo everyone to prevent them from going back." As previously reported, after entering the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp, Han Eun-song personally sneaked into Seoul to listen to "instructions" from Lee Syngman and Won Yong-duk, and then conveyed them to the special agents in each camp, ordering them to use terror and murder to deal with prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated. Wen Chang-soo saw an "instruction" issued by the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," which said: "The 'Government of the Republic of Korea' has instructed us to kill unreliable elements. We have now tentatively killed unreliable elements of Lee Ji-soo's battalion. The Indians have not noticed, and you can do the same."

Ji Gi-cheol, another recipient of the intercepted secret instructions, was the special agent "battalion commander" of the 40th camp area, and understood Chinese. On October 16th, Wen Chang-soo heard Zhuo Wu-lie, the special agent "battalion commander" of his camp, say: "Yesterday, Ji Gi-cheol and I secretly went near the explanatory site. At that time, a Kuomintang observer representative came over and talked to Ji Gi-cheol. Today, Ji Gi-cheol again requested to hold a meeting with representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to exchange experiences in opposing explanation."

Earlier this month, the Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stated that he could not accept the view that there were special agent activities in the camp because there was "no evidence" to show that special agents had infiltrated the camp. Now, the interception and public disclosure of Lee Syngman's secret instructions has provided irrefutable evidence of the collusion between the US, Lee, and Chiang to command special agent activities within the camp.

### 我方归来人员揭露  元容德直接指挥战俘营特务破坏解释工作

    我方归来人员揭露
    元容德直接指挥战俘营特务破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城二十七日电】印度看管部队截获的李承晚集团的秘密指令，证明东场里战俘营李匪特务组织的直接指挥者是李匪宪兵总司令官元容德。元容德曾亲手制造今年六月间强迫扣留两万七千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的事件，而使朝鲜战争延长了一个多月。据我方归来人员揭露，在朝中被俘人员被送到非军事区以前，元容德曾亲自到战俘营中布置破坏解释工作的活动。
    归来人员文长洙说： “今年八月一日，我看见元容德和几个美国高级军官到我们营场里来，向战俘宣读李承晚的恐吓信。元容德还说他是李承晚特别派来的，叫我们听他的话。”在元容德走后不久，一个自称负责交通方面的美国少将和一个自称是遣返组负责人的美国准将又到战俘营里来，做了许多预谋破坏解释工作的布置，并亲自胁迫过战俘，叫他们不许回家。
    被截获的李匪特务的秘密指令说，东场里战俘营特务指挥中心“雨南村反共青年团”的“团长”就在元容德的宪兵司令部内，而在“巨济里”、“论山”、“病院”中各设一“副团长”。归来人员说，这个意思就是在东场里EFG三个营区各设一个“副团长”。因为，从原巨济里及釜山战俘营移入中立国看管营的朝鲜人民军战俘多在E营区；从美方战俘医院来的战俘在F营区；从论山战俘营来的战俘在G营区。元容德就通过这样的系统来直接控制战俘，加强指挥破坏解释工作的罪恶活动。
    据归来人员说，秘密指令的受件人之一韩银松，是美李匪帮经过长期训练的特务分子。文长洙说，早在一九五一年四月间，韩银松就在美国特务机关“CIC”的指挥下工作。文长洙经常看到
  “CIC”的吉普车把韩银松送到营场中的“CIC”机构领受特务活动的指示。韩银松还和战俘营中的美军宪兵司令部和李匪宪兵军官保持经常的联系。有一次，韩银松从美军宪兵司令部回去后对他手下的人说：“我们快到中立区去了，有些人可能不保险，所以必须给每个人刺上字，使他们不敢回去。”前已报道，进入中立国看管营场以后，韩银松曾亲自潜往汉城，听取李承晚、元容德的“指示”，回来后就向各营场的特务分子传达，要他们以恐怖谋杀手段对付愿意遣返的战俘。文长洙曾看到“反共青年团”发下的一个“指令”，大意说：“‘大韩民国政府’指示我们把不可靠的分子杀掉，现在我们已试杀了李志洙大队的不可靠分子，印度人并没有发觉，你们也可以这样办。”
    被截获的秘密指令的另一受件人池基哲，是第四十号营场的特务“大队长”，懂得中国话。十月十六日，文长洙曾经听到他所在的营场的特务“大队长”卓武烈说：“昨天我和池基哲曾偷偷地到解释场所附近，那时一个国民党观察代表走过来和池基哲谈了话。今天，池基哲又要求和中国人民志愿军战俘代表开会，交换反对解释的经验。”
    在本月上旬，中立国遣返委员会瑞士委员曾表示他不能接受营场中有特务活动的看法，因为“没有证据”说明有特务潜入营场。现在，李承晚的秘密指令的被截获和公布，已为美、李、蒋合谋指挥营场内的特务活动提供了不容置辩的证据。
