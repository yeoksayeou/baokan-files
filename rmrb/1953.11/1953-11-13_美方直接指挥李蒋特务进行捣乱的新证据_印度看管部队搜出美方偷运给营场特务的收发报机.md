Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 11th: Our special correspondent reports: There is now new evidence proving that the U.S. military authorities directly commanded the Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps. In a bag of grain sent by the U.S. military command to the prisoner-of-war camp south of the demilitarized zone, the Indian custodial forces found a radio transceiver. This was obviously smuggled in by the U.S. military authorities to the special agents in the prisoner-of-war camp in order to intensify their command to sabotage the explanation work and persecute prisoners of war.

The captured North Korean and Chinese personnel who returned after breaking through the control of the special agents had already revealed in Panmunjom that the U.S. side used the opportunity of supplying food to the prisoners of war to smuggle weapons and other items to the Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. When the prisoners of war were handed over to the Indian custodial forces, the special agents had already brought in many radio receivers. It can be asserted that during this past period, the U.S. side had smuggled more radio communication equipment into the prisoner-of-war camps. Therefore, the U.S. command of the special agents is now very timely. On November 5th, the U.S. side and the representatives of Switzerland and Sweden clamored that the explanation time for each prisoner of war by the North Korean and Chinese side was too long and demanded that the explanation time be limited. The next day, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents raised the same demand and refused to allow prisoners of war to come out to listen to the explanation under this pretext. This clearly shows that there is close telecommunication contact between the U.S. military authorities and the special agents.

The facts discovered by the Indian custodial forces thoroughly expose the lies spread by the U.S. propaganda machine that slandered the North Korean and Chinese side for delaying the explanation work. This fact proves that the U.S. side should bear direct and full responsibility for the current situation in which the explanation work has been repeatedly suspended due to the obstruction of the Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. If the U.S. side does not stop plotting and instructing special agents to sabotage the explanation work, and if the special agents mixed among the prisoners of war are not thoroughly eliminated, then the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will never be able to fully perform its duties, and the explanation work will not be able to proceed normally.

The Indian custodial forces also intercepted a coded letter from the Lee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. This letter was wrapped in a stone and thrown from one prisoner-of-war camp to the so-called "hospital" camp. The returnees from the North Korean and Chinese side had already revealed that this so-called "hospital" camp was actually the U.S. headquarters for directing special agent activities on the spot.

    美方直接指挥李蒋特务进行捣乱的新证据
    印度看管部队搜出美方偷运给营场特务的收发报机
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者报道：现在又有新的证据，证明美国军事当局直接指挥着战俘营中的李承晚和蒋介石匪帮特务。在美军司令部送给非军事区南部战俘营的一袋粮食中，印度看管部队搜到了一部无线电收发报机。这显然是美国军事当局偷运给战俘营中的特务分子，以便加紧指挥他们破坏解释工作和迫害战俘的。
    突破特务控制遣返归来的朝中被俘人员早就在板门店揭露美方利用供给战俘粮食的机会偷运武器等物品给李、蒋特务。在战俘被移交给印度看管部队时，特务们就已经带进去了不少无线电收音机。可以断言，在过去这个时期中，美方已经将更多的无线电通讯器材偷运进了战俘营。因此，美方对特务的指挥现在十分及时。在十一月五日，美方和瑞士、瑞典的代表叫嚣说朝中方面对每个战俘的解释时间太长，要求限制解释时间，第二天，蒋匪特务就提出同样的要求，并且以此为藉口拒绝让战俘出来听取解释。这清楚地说明了美国军事当局和特务之间有着密切的电讯联络。
    印度看管部队所发现的事实，彻底揭穿了美国宣传机器所散布的诬蔑朝中方面拖延解释工作的谎言。这个事实证明：对于目前解释工作因李、蒋特务的阻挠而一再停顿的局面，美方应该负直接的完全的责任。如果美方不停止布置和指使特务破坏解释工作的阴谋，如果混在战俘中间的特务不被彻底清除，那末中立国遣返委员会决不能完满执行它的职务，解释工作也将不能正常进行。
    印度看管部队还截获了一封李、蒋特务的密码信。这封信是包在一块石头上，从一个战俘营场投到所谓“医院”营去。朝中方面归来人员早已揭露：这个所谓“医院”营实际上是美方就地指挥特务活动的大本营。
