Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd. US-backed Kuomintang special agents destroyed evidence of Zhang Zilong's murder days before the investigation began. Zhang Zilong's body was burned to ashes and then washed away in a ditch. This was revealed by eleven Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who returned this afternoon in a tent in Panmunjom to neutral nation personnel.

These eleven captured personnel were all those who applied for repatriation during the neutral nation repatriation committee's investigation into the Zhang Zilong murder case at Camp 28 today. A total of seventeen people applied for repatriation at that time, some of whom also volunteered to testify. Now, except for six people who remained with the neutral nation repatriation committee to continue testifying, eleven people returned at 4:30 this afternoon. This fact once again exposes the US side's deceptive propaganda about prisoners of war "unwilling to listen to explanations" and "refusing repatriation."

Lu Kai, one of the eleven returnees from Camp 28, was originally a cook in the camp. He described the situation of the special agents burning Zhang Zilong's body in the kitchen: "That day, the special agents dug up Zhang's body from under the tent of the Third Company headquarters, smashed it, poured kerosene on it, and burned it in the stove for a full four hours. The special agents were afraid of the smell of dead bodies, so they forced the prisoners of war to send more than a dozen pairs of leather shoes to burn with Zhang Zilong's body. Finally, they poured Zhang's ashes into the ditch and washed them away." Returnees said that in order to eliminate evidence, the special agents also dug up the old soil from the pit where Zhang Zilong was originally buried and replaced it with new soil.

According to another returnee, Cheng Liyou, the murderers of Zhang Zilong were special agent "Battalion Commander" Zhang Yuwang, "Garrison Captain" Wu Baoshan, and "Third Company Commander" Chen Fusheng, among seven people, who have been arrested and placed under guard during today's morning investigation.

Zhang Yongbin, a returnee who was in the same company as Zhang Zilong, reported in detail the process of Zhang Zilong's brutal murder. He said: "When the special agents discovered that Zhang Zilong wanted to return to the country, they first hung him on a tent pole and beat him severely overnight. The next day, they cut off pieces of flesh from his body, then cut off his ears and fingers, skinned his head, and cut off his buttocks. When he was tortured to the point of being bloody and only had a trace of breath left, the special agents burned him with kerosene, and finally cut open his stomach, dug out his heart and liver, cooked them, and forced the prisoners of war to eat them." The neutral nation personnel present were shocked by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents' inhumane and brutal acts.

When talking about his escape, Zhang Yongbin said: "We wanted to return to the country long ago, but the special agents controlled us too strictly, and there was no opportunity. The special agents in the camp are still beating people every day, and the prisoners of war have no freedom of movement at all. Today, after the Indian soldiers surrounded the camp, the special agents were all scared. I also saw our reporters on the scene, so of course I wanted to return to our motherland!"

Returnees said that during the first investigation by the neutral nation repatriation committee yesterday, two Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war also climbed the barbed wire fence on the spot to request repatriation. However, because no effective measures were taken against the special agents at that time, the two were dragged back to the camp by the special agents, had their mouths stuffed with towels, and were tied up with ropes and severely beaten. When Indian soldiers came to ask for the two that night, the special agents had no choice but to hand them over. These two captured personnel have now been isolated and placed under guard.

Today, another Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war returned from Camp B. He had heard that the Americans put small radios, pistols, and instructions in rice bags and sent them to Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents hidden in the prisoner of war camp. As far as he knew, that small radio was in the camp of the "Regimental Commander" special agent leader Wang Shunqing of the First Regiment.

Along with the above twelve Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, three Korean People's Army prisoners of war also returned today, one of whom escaped from Camp 48. Camp 48 was a camp where the Korean-Chinese side originally planned to carry out explanation work today.

    在调查张子龙被害案时要求遣返的我方被俘人员
    揭露美方特务在调查前毁尸灭迹的情形
    【新华社开城二日电】美方的国民党特务在调查开始前几天消灭了谋杀张子龙的罪证。张子龙的尸体被烧成灰烬，然后放在水沟内冲走。这是今天下午归来的十一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员在板门店帐篷中向中立国人员揭露的。
    这十一名被俘人员都是今天中立国遣返委员会在第二十八号营场对张子龙被杀案进行调查时申请遣返的。当时申请遣返的共有十七个人，其中有人还自动要求作证。现在，除六个人留在中立国遣返委员会继续作证外，十一个人在下午四时半归来了。这个事实再一次揭穿了美方宣传所谓战俘“不愿听解释”、“拒绝遣返”等的漫天大谎。
    第二十八号营场的十一名归来者之一卢凯，原来在该营场当伙夫。他叙述特务们在伙房焚烧张子龙尸体的情况说：“那天，特务把张的尸体从三中队队部的帐篷下挖出来，捣碎，浇上火油，放在灶里整整烧了四个钟头。特务怕有死人臭味，还强迫战俘们送来十几双皮鞋，和张子龙的尸体一起烧掉。最后把张的骨灰倒在水沟里冲走了。”归来人员说，特务为了消灭罪证，还把原来埋过张子龙的坑穴中的旧土挖掉，换上新土。
    据另一名归来人员程立有说，杀害张子龙的凶手是特务“大队长”张宇旺、“警备队长”武宝山、“三中队长”陈福生等七人，他们已在今天上午调查中被逮捕看管。
    曾经和张子龙同在一个中队的归来人员张永斌详细地报告了张子龙被惨杀的经过。他说：“特务们发现张子龙要回国时，先把他吊在帐篷杆子上毒打了一夜。第二天，就一块一块地割下他身上的肉，然后又割下他的耳朵、手指，剥掉头皮，割掉屁股。当他被折磨得血肉模糊、只剩一丝气息的时候，特务又用火油烧他，最后才剖开肚子，挖出心肝煮熟，强迫战俘们吃。”在场的中立国人员都为蒋匪特务这种惨绝人寰毫无人性的暴行而感到震惊。
    张永斌在谈到他逃出来的经过时说：“我们早就要回国，但特务控制得太严，一直没有机会。营场里的特务现在还是天天打人，战俘根本没有行动自由。今天印度兵把营场包围以后，特务们都害怕了。我又看见咱们的记者在场，我当然要回我们的祖国！”
    归来人员说，在昨天中立国遣返委员会进行第一次调查时，也曾有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员当场爬铁丝网要求遣返。但当时因为没有对特务采取有效措施，这两人又被特务拉回营场，用毛巾塞住嘴，并用绳捆绑起来加以毒打。当晚印度兵来要这二人时，特务才不得不交出来。现在这两名被俘人员已被隔离看管。
    今天还有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员是从B号营区归来的。他曾听说美国人把小型电台、手枪和指示信，装在米袋里送给隐藏在战俘营的蒋匪特务，据他知道那部小型电台现在一联队“联队长”特务头子王顺清所在的营场。
    今天和上述十二名中国人民志愿军被俘人员一同归来的还有三名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，其中一名是从第四十八号营场逃出来的。第四十八号营场是朝中方面原定在今天要进行解释工作的一个营场。
