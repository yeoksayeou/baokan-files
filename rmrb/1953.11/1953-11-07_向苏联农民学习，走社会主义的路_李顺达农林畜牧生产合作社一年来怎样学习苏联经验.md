Learning from Soviet Farmers, Taking the Socialist Road
—How Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Has Learned from Soviet Experiences in the Past Year

    After visiting the Soviet Union in 1952, agricultural labor model Li Shunda increased his knowledge and brought back many valuable experiences. He understood that the path of Soviet farmers was the path for Chinese farmers and resolved to learn from Soviet farmers to run his agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative well.
    When Li Shunda returned to Xigou Village, the cooperative was discussing the autumn afforestation plan. The members did not have much confidence in this matter, and their enthusiasm was not high. Some said, "Millennial pine, ten-thousand-year cypress, a person who lives to be a hundred years old won't benefit from it." Some said, "Our Black Gulch has no soil, only stones, nothing will work." Some people were even clamoring to move down the mountain. Although 200 mu were afforested last spring, few survived because everyone did not take care of them, and no one cared about the damage caused by cattle and sheep. Seeing this situation, Li Shunda talked to the members about the Soviet Union's experience in building mountains and the prospects for developing forestry. Li Shunda told everyone, "There are many places in the Soviet Union where the mountains are bigger and more numerous than ours, and they are now electrified. There are also electric lights, radios, and running water on the top of the mountains, and cars are running. People there rely on organizing to develop forestry and animal husbandry to live a happy life." Some members said, "Can our Xigou Village compare with the Soviet Union?" Li Shunda then introduced the situation of the Soviet "Red October" collective farm: Before the October Revolution, it was also a very poor small village with only nine peasant households. After the revolution, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, they organized, collectively labored and produced, supported the construction of socialist industry, obtained agricultural machinery, improved production technology, and the farmers' production greatly improved, so life slowly became better. Now, this place has become a large village of 158 households, and everyone, young and old, is living a happy and joyful life.
    Li Shunda told the members how Soviet farmers built mountains, how they supported national construction, and how they organized to get rid of poverty and become wealthy together. Everyone became more enthusiastic about developing forestry. Member Zhang Wangxing said, "In the past, we often said to learn from the Soviet elder brother, but we never knew what to learn; the good methods that Shunda brought back to us, we must do them one by one." Everyone also recalled some successful examples of local tree planting. The peach and apricot trees planted by Li Shunda three years ago yielded more than three dan in 1952; the walnut trees planted by Song Jinshan and Zhang Zhiyu in the past can now yield three or five dou per plant. Everyone used these facts to discuss in connection with the path taken by the people in the Soviet mountainous areas, and they all decided to plant trees, and some people dispelled the idea of moving down the mountain. They also proposed to "plant a nest and live a nest; plant a tree and live a tree," and as a result, they overfulfilled the autumn afforestation plan.
    This year, Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative adopted the Soviet Union's experience of dividing forest areas in a planned way, separating forest areas and pasture areas, assigning special personnel to be responsible, strengthening technical guidance for forestry, and resolving the contradiction between forestry and animal husbandry. In spring and summer, 500 mu of barren mountains were sown and more than 9,300 trees were planted, completing the annual afforestation plan in two seasons, with a survival rate of 70% to 80%. In particular, more than 20 mu of orchards were cultivated, with Northeast apples and Qingdao grapes. They used the grafting scissors sent to Li Shunda by Soviet friends to graft more than 200 fruit trees. Now, the grafted Northeast apples have grown very tall and will bear fruit in three years. These things further encouraged everyone's confidence in developing mountain production. Lu Wenquan, who used to want to move, has become an activist in planting trees.
    They also learned from the advanced Soviet experience in animal husbandry. Originally, the members did not pay enough attention to animal husbandry, thinking that livestock breed slowly, and it was time-consuming and wasteful to work. Moreover, due to lack of experience, the stall was too big at once. Last year, the cooperative lost four dan of rice by raising 18 pigs; livestock and sheep were all incorporated into the cooperative at once, and more than 20 million yuan were lost due to poor management. In this way, the members became even less interested in animal husbandry. This spring, when correcting the tendency of blind advance, the members had another illusion that the cooperative would no longer develop animal husbandry. In order to make everyone correctly understand this issue, and in order to better develop animal husbandry in the future, Li Shunda repeatedly introduced the Soviet farmers' experience in developing animal husbandry to the members. He told everyone: Collective farms in the Soviet Union raise livestock and poultry. As soon as you enter the farm, you can hear the chickens and ducks croaking, and see the cattle and sheep full of circles. This is a large income. Especially in mountainous areas, it is more important to develop animal husbandry. In the past, our livestock work had problems because our cooperative did not have enough experience and took too big a step at once. The cooperative corrected the tendency of blind advance in order to better develop agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry, not not to develop animal husbandry. As long as we proceed from reality and handle things according to conditions, learning from the Soviet Union is correct. Member Zhang Qiuquan said: "Shunda is right. Breaking the gong with one hammer is not a good skill. It is right to develop animal husbandry, but it must be done in a steady and down-to-earth manner." Everyone agreed: According to the existing conditions in the cooperative, the pigs should be distributed to each household for self-raising, and some of the sheep should be sold, and only more than 300 sheep should be raised for the time being. They also learned from the advanced experience of Soviet animal husbandry, set up a livestock team to manage livestock, divided the sheep into several groups for grazing, and set a quota reward method. In order to solve the problem of insufficient forage, they adopted the Soviet grass-field rotation system and planted 20 mu of low-yielding land with alfalfa. In the past four months, because the management methods have been improved, the sheep have grown fat and strong; the livestock have also gradually increased. The members have also newly bought three livestock and eight pigs. Six mares have been mated with excellent Soviet stallions; it is also planned to mate 100 ewes with Merino fine wool sheep. Everyone has accepted the lesson of the winter snow pressing on the mountain slopes last year, the sheep lacking grass to eat, and 80 sheep dying. And Li Shunda introduced the Soviet experience of accumulating grass in autumn to prepare for winter, and now they have stored forage for livestock to spend the winter.

    In terms of agricultural production, even more advanced experience has been learned. This year, 256 mu of corn and millet adopted the experience of appropriate close planting. Although they suffered from drought, the yield was still higher than that of sparse planting. When promoting the experience of close planting, many members' ideas were not clear. Li Shunda connected the facts of Soviet farmers increasing the yield per unit area with the fact that the high-yield corn of the cooperative last year was denser than the average corn, and cleared everyone's thinking.
    Li Shunda also introduced the Soviet collective farm's system of "labor has quotas, and there are rewards for exceeding quotas." After the cooperative adopted it, it improved the members' production enthusiasm and creativity, and changed the past bias of some members who paid attention to quantity but not quality in their work. In the spring and summer alone, labor efficiency increased by more than 19%. The saved labor was used for farmland capital construction and sideline production, which increased everyone's income. The members said: The experience that Shunda brought back from the Soviet Union is really a "magic key," and there is no lock that cannot be opened.
    After Li Shunda returned from the Soviet Union, he was very happy to see that the cooperative had already worked with the people of the whole village to formulate a three-year production and construction plan. In order to make this plan more realistic and more reasonable, and in order to adapt to the period of the national construction plan, Li Shunda led everyone to revise the three-year plan into a five-year plan this spring. According to the specific circumstances, with reference to the Soviet experience, the goals of developing forestry and animal husbandry were revised, and the project of developing small-scale water conservancy was added. The forest area and pasture area were specifically divided; some modifications were also made in other aspects to make the content of the plan more substantial. According to this plan, the income of all farmers in the cooperative can be increased by two to two and a half times by 1957 compared to 1952. The members discussed this plan, had a clearer understanding of their future, and participated more actively in various construction work. Before this summer, three ditches were dammed; 32 water-blocking dikes and one large stone dam were built, which can protect and repair more than 30 mu of river bend land (6 mu have been repaired this year and planted with wheat). With the help of the state, they also built three reservoirs, which are now full of clear water, enough for the whole village to drink, wash clothes, and drink livestock. This is a major benefit for the water-scarce Xigou Village.
    In the autumn harvest appraisal, Li Shunda guided the members to recall the results of learning from the advanced Soviet experience in the past year. The members already have a deep friendship with the Soviet people. The members saw the socialist vision from concrete facts. Everyone is full of confidence in taking the road of collectivization and wants to build Xigou Village better.

    向苏联农民学习，走社会主义的路
    ——李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社一年来怎样学习苏联经验
    陈杰　关振中
    农业劳动模范李顺达一九五二年到苏联参观了一次后，增长了许多知识，带了许多宝贵的经验回来。他明白苏联农民的道路就是我国农民的道路，决心向苏联农民学习，把自己的农林畜牧生产合作社办好。
    李顺达回到西沟村时，社里正在谈着秋季造林计划。对于这件事，社员们信心都不大，情绪都不高。有的说：“千年松，万年柏，活一百岁的人也沾不了它的光。”有的说：“咱这黑山沟，没土光石头，干啥也不成。”有些人还吵着要往山下搬。虽然去年春天造林二百亩，可是因为大家没有用心照料，成活的很少，牛羊损害也没人管。李顺达看到这种情形，就和社员们谈了苏联建设山地的经验和发展林业的前途。李顺达告诉大家：“苏联很多地方的山，比咱这山又大又多，现在也电气化了，山顶上也有电灯、无线电、自来水，也跑着汽车。那儿的人们就是依靠组织起来发展林业和畜牧业过着幸福生活的。”有的社员说：“咱们这西沟村还能和苏联比？”李顺达就又介绍了苏联“红十月”集体农庄的情形：在十月革命以前，那里也是一个很穷苦的小庄，只有九户农民。革命以后，在苏联共产党领导下，组织起来，集体劳动生产，支援社会主义工业建设，得到了农业机器，改进了生产技术，农民的生产大大提高了，生活才慢慢好起来。现在，这个地方已经是一个一百五十八户的大村庄了，男女老少个个人都过着幸福愉快的生活。
    李顺达把苏联农民怎样建设山地、怎样支援国家建设、怎样组织起来摆脱贫困大家一同富裕起来的做法都给社员们讲了，大家发展林业的劲头就大了。社员张旺兴说：“过去常说向苏联老大哥学习，总不知道学些啥；顺达给咱带回来的好办法，咱要照着一件一件去做。”大家并回忆了本地栽树成功的一些实例。三年前李顺达栽的桃树和杏树，一九五二年就收了三石多；宋金山、张芝玉过去栽的核桃树，每株已经能收到三、五斗。大家拿这些事实和苏联山区人民走过的路联系起来展开了讨论，都定下心来栽树了，一些人搬家下山的思想也打消了。并提出，要“播一窝，活一窝；栽一棵，活一棵”，结果超额完成了秋季造林计划。
    今年，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社又采用苏联有计划地划分林区的经验，把林区和牧区分开，由专人负责，加强了对林业的技术指导，并且解决了林业和牧业的矛盾。春夏两季荒山播种五百亩、植树九千三百多株，两季就完成了全年的造林计划，成活的有十分之七、八。特别是栽培了二十多亩果园，里面有东北大苹果和青岛葡萄。他们用苏联朋友送给李顺达的嫁接剪刀接了二百多株果树，现在接木的东北苹果已经长得很高，三年后就能结果子。这些事情更进一步鼓舞了大家发展山区生产的信心。过去想搬家的路文全，已经成了植树造林的积极分子。
    他们在畜牧业方面也学习了苏联先进经验。原先，社员们对于畜牧事业也是不够重视的，认为牲畜繁殖得慢，误工费事。而且因为经验不足，一下子摊子摆得太大，去年社里喂十八口猪就赔了四石米；牲口、羊群一下子都入社，也因管理不善赔了二千多万元。这样，社员们对畜牧业更不感兴趣了。今年春季纠正盲目冒进倾向的时候，社员们又产生了一种错觉，认为社里不再发展畜牧事业了。李顺达为了使大家正确地认识这个问题，为了以后更好地发展畜牧业，又向社员反复地介绍了苏联农民发展畜牧业的经验。他告诉大家：苏联的集体农庄，都养家畜家禽，一进农庄就听见鸡鸭乱叫，看见牛羊满圈，这是一笔大收入。特别是山区，发展畜牧业更是重要。过去我们牧畜工作有毛病，是因为咱们社的经验不够，一下子走的步太大了。社里纠正盲目冒进，是为了更好地发展农林畜牧事业，并不是不发展畜牧业了。只要我们从实际出发、看条件办事，学习苏联是错不了的。社员张秋全说：“顺达说得对。一锤敲破锣，不是好把式。发展畜牧是对的，不过要稳扎稳打地办。”大家议定：按照社内现有条件，把猪分给各家自养，把羊群卖出一部分，暂时只养三百多只。他们还学习了苏联畜牧业的先进经验，专设了畜牧队管理牲畜，把羊群分开几组牧放，定出了定额奖励办法。为了解决草料不足的问题，他们采用苏联的草田轮作制，把二十亩产量低的地种了苜蓿。四个月来，因为改善了经营管理方法，羊群长得又肥又大；牲畜也逐渐增多了。社员个人又新买了三头牲口，八口猪。六匹母马已用苏联优良种马交配了；还计划用美利奴细毛羊交配一百只母羊。大家接受去年冬季雪压山坡、羊群缺草吃、死羊八十只的教训，并且由李顺达介绍了苏联秋季积草准备过冬的经验，现在已经储备了牲畜过冬的草料。
              ×　×　×
    农业生产方面，学习的先进经验更多。今年有二百五十六亩玉米和谷子采用了适当密植的经验，虽受了旱灾，产量还是比稀植的高。在推广密植经验的时候，许多社员思想不通，李顺达用苏联农民提高单位面积产量的事实和去年本社丰产玉茭比一般玉茭密的事实联系起来，把大家的思想打通了。
    李顺达还介绍了苏联集体农庄里“劳动有定额、超额有奖励”的制度。社里采用后，提高了社员生产积极性和创造性，改变了过去有些社员做活重量不重质的偏向，光春夏两季，就提高劳动效率百分之十九强。省下来的工，用到农田基本建设和副业生产上，增加了大家的收入。社员们说：顺达从苏联带回来的经验真是“灵钥匙”，没有开不了的锁。
    李顺达从苏联回来以后，看到社里已经和全村人民在一起订了个三年生产建设计划，心里很高兴。为了使这计划更切合实际，更加合理，并且为了和国家建设计划的时期相适应，李顺达今年春天领导大家把三年计划修订成五年计划，根据具体情况，参照苏联经验，把发展林业、畜牧业的目标修改了，增加了发展小型水利的项目，把林区牧区具体地划分开来；别的方面也作了一些修改，使计划的内容更加充实了。按照这个计划，全社农民的收入，到一九五七年可以比一九五二年提高两倍到两倍半。社员们讨论了这个计划，对于自己的前途认识得更清楚了，都更加积极地参加各种建设工作。今年夏季以前就闸住了三道沟岔；筑了三十二条拦水堰、一条大石头坝，能保护兴修河湾地三十多亩（今年已经修成六亩，种上了麦子）。在国家的帮助下，他们还修了三个蓄水池，现在满池清水，足够全村人饮食、洗衣和饮牲畜用，这是缺水的西沟村的一大福利。
    在秋收评比中，李顺达引导社员们回想了一下一年来学习苏联先进经验的成果。社员们对苏联人民已经有了很深厚的友情。社员们从具体事实中看到了社会主义的远景，大家都满怀信心地走合作化的道路，要把西沟村建设得更好。
