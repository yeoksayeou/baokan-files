    State-Owned Trading Departments Improve Business Practices and Simplify Sales Procedures
    (I)
    Reader Wan Guoyi writes: The wholesale department of the Xinmin County Department Store in Liaoxi Province overfulfilled its quarterly sales plan twenty days ahead of schedule in the third quarter. The reasons for this, in addition to mobilizing all employees to discuss the plan, maintaining good relations with cooperatives and private stores, also include improving labor organization and simplifying sales procedures.
    In the past, the wholesale department was divided into four sales groups, each responsible for the sales and delivery of their respective groups. Because of the small number of people (some groups had only one person), and because each sale and delivery took three or four minutes, the groups were often unable to handle both sales and delivery when they were busy, resulting in situations where there was no one to sell goods when deliveries were being made, or no one to make deliveries when sales were being made. Especially when a new batch of goods arrived, customers were even more crowded. Some cooperatives and private merchants, after waiting for several days without being able to buy goods, simply went to Shenyang to buy them instead.
    In August, the wholesale department held a general meeting to study this problem, and it was unanimously agreed that the above situation could only be changed by changing the labor organization and simplifying sales procedures. The solution was to assign one person to be a full-time delivery clerk, responsible for the delivery work of all four groups; the remaining personnel in each group would be responsible for sales work; in addition, a commodity sample room was established; and some commodities were delivered directly from the warehouse. After implementation, it was indeed possible to ensure that customers could "come, buy, process, and leave immediately," which satisfied customers; the store clerks no longer had to run around like they did in the past, which improved labor efficiency; and the turnover increased month by month, with an increase of 7.6 percent in August compared to July, and an increase of 11 percent in September compared to August.
    (II)
    The Industry and Commerce Section of the Changwei Special District Office in Shandong Province writes: Since the beginning of the third quarter, the state-owned trading departments in Changwei County have studied and simplified sales procedures, and have universally checked and improved their business practices.
    In terms of sales procedures, for example, in department stores, customers used to have to go through six procedures to buy goods: first, contact the purchasing and supply section; second, take the letter of introduction from the purchasing and supply section to the warehouse to inspect the goods; third, go to the purchasing and supply section to issue a joint list; fourth, take the joint list to the bank to pay; fifth, return to the purchasing and supply section to exchange for a delivery order; and sixth, go to the warehouse to pick up the goods. In this way, the most smooth transaction would take two hours, and slightly less smooth transactions would take half a day to a day. Now they have moved the office space of the bill writers in the purchasing and supply section to the warehouse together, which not only saves customers a lot of running around, but also saves the store manpower and material resources for issuing joint lists. The purchasing station of the cotton yarn and cloth company has also modified the fourteen procedures in the commodity circulation links. The wholesale station of the department store has abolished the past system of only allowing three deliveries to the warehouse per day. All of this has made customers feel convenient, and the trade departments themselves have also accelerated the commodity circulation process.
    At the same time, units such as department stores and cotton yarn and cloth companies have held meetings of salespersons, deciding to improve business practices and attitudes towards customers. After this, state-owned stores have expanded the variety of commodities they handle according to market needs, increased business hours, and also paid attention to publicity work, all of which have expanded the reputation of state-owned commercial institutions.

### 国营贸易部门改进经营作风简化销货手续

专栏：读者来信摘要

    国营贸易部门改进经营作风简化销货手续
    （一）
    读者万国义来信：辽西省新民县百货公司批发部在第三季度提早二十天超额完成了全季销售计划。其原因除了在制订计划时发动全体职工讨论和合作社及私营商店搞好关系外，并改进了劳动组织，简化了销货手续。
    过去，批发部内分四个售货组，各自负责本组的售货、提货工作。因为人少（有的组只有一个人），而且一次售货、提货要花三、四十分钟，所以有的组忙时内外不能兼顾，常常造成提货时无人售货或售货时无人提货的现象。特别是赶上新到一批货，顾客更加拥挤不堪。有的合作社和私商，等了几天买不到，便索性到沈阳去买了。
    八月间，批发部召开全体会议研究了这个问题，一致认为，必须改变劳动组织和简化销货手续，才能改变上述情况。办法是：抽出一人做专职提货员，专管四个组的提货工作；各组其余人员专管售货工作；此外，又设立商品样品室；部分商品由仓库直拔。实施以后，确能做到使顾客“随来，随购，随办，随走”，顾客很满意；店员也不再像过去那样内外奔跑，提高了劳动效率；营业额因而月月增加，八月份比七月份增加百分之七点六，九月份比八月份增加了百分之十一。
    （二）
    山东昌潍专署工商科来信：第三季度开始以来，昌潍县各国营贸易部门研究和简化了销货手续，并普遍检查和改进了经营作风。
    在销货手续方面，如百货商店，过去顾客上门购货，须经过六道手续：一，先到采供科联系；二，拿采供科的介绍信到仓库看货；三，再到采供科开联单；四，拿联单到银行交款；五，回采供科换提货单；六，到仓库提货。这样，一笔交易最顺利也要两小时，稍不顺利就要半天到一天。现在他们把采供科写票员的办公地方搬到仓库一起，这不但使顾客少跑不少路，而且商店方面也节省了开联单的人力物力。花纱布公司采购站也修改了商品流转环节中的十四种手续。百货公司批发站取消了过去每天只准到仓库提货三次的制度。这都使顾客感到便利，贸易部门本身也加速了商品流转过程。
    同时，百货公司、花纱布公司等单位都召开了销货员会议，决定要改善经营作风和对待顾客的态度。在这以后，各国营商店根据市场需要，扩大了商品经营品种，增添了营业时间，还注意了宣传工作，这些都使国营商业机构的信誉扩大了。
