New Achievements in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

    Improving Rice Milling Methods to Increase Rice Yield
    The staff of the Zhejiang Provincial Local State-Owned Shengxian No. 4 Rice Processing Factory put forward the slogan "One more grain is one more grain, saving one grain is saving one grain." Using the "fast light milling" method, they regularly inspect the windmills to prevent broken rice from leaking into the bran. In this way, an average of about 70 jin of white rice can be milled from every 100 jin of rice, an increase of 2 jin compared to before. The factory mills an average of about 20,000 jin of rice per day in October. Calculated on the basis of an increase of 2 jin of rice per 100 jin, farmers can increase their income by 400 jin of rice per day. Based on 300 working days a year, this would increase the output by about 120,000 jin of rice. Therefore, nearby farmers are very willing to bring their rice for processing. In October, the factory overfulfilled its production plan and financial plan. (Shen Chuyi)

    Completing the Entire Month's Drilling Task in Eight Working Days
    The drilling workers of the Hunan Chaling Iron Plant Exploration Team worked diligently and enthusiastically, day and night, regardless of wind and rain. The workers of the No. 13 drilling machine, in early September, drilled 80.34 meters from a depth of 176 meters in eight working days. The core recovery rate reached 76%, exceeding the entire month's task. (Li Huijun)

    Completing Dehydration Pipe Installation Ahead of Schedule
    In order to reduce coal washing moisture, shorten coking time, increase coke production, and extend the life of the coke oven, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decided to install dehydration pipes in the dehydration tank of the coal washing workshop. This project was undertaken by the factory's Engineering Company Processing Plant and was expected to be completed in three months. Because the employees of the processing plant realized that completing the task ahead of schedule and putting it into production as soon as possible was a practical action in response to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, they actively used their brains, found tricks, and improved operating methods, etc. As a result, the task was completed 43 days ahead of schedule. The early completion of this project can increase coke production by 1,000 tons, worth more than 300 million yuan. (Xue Xinheng)

    Successful Trial Production of "High-Speed Steel"
    In the campaign to increase production and practice economy at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, engineer Ji Jiushao worked closely with workers to successfully trial produce "high-speed steel," solving the plant's shortage of cutting tools. After actual testing, the quality has reached the standard of合格率.

    High-speed steel is an advanced tool steel that is widely used in machine factories. Various lathe tools, washing knives, rolling knives, taps, and dies are all made of "high-speed steel." Now, they have made a batch of lathe tools and are preparing to manufacture various tools in large quantities to put into production to ensure the overfulfillment of the plan to increase production and practice economy.

    Suiyuan Licorice Factory Continuously Sets New Records
    After the state-owned Suiyuan Licorice Factory launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it continuously set new production records. The laboratory staff proposed adding a small amount of earth alkali to the grass soaking tank, which shortened the grass soaking time by more than six hours. Workers in Liu Laohu's team in the ointment making workshop found the trick to increase production from the original 100 kilograms of ointment per shift to 201 kilograms. Feng Fuwang's team studied the experience of Liu Laohu's team and believed that in addition to the need for large packaging of semi-finished products, it is also necessary to stir frequently during operation to allow the ointment to have more contact with the air. Using this method, they continuously created new records of 224 kilograms and 242 kilograms per shift on October 14 and 16. The highest day reached 271 kilograms, and the quality also met the standards. The example of the ointment making workshop continuously improving production efficiency inspired the workers in other workshops. The carpentry team put forward the slogan "The ointment making workshop produces as much ointment as we supply boxes." Now their production efficiency has more than doubled compared to before.

    After Visiting the Exhibition Hall, Workers Focus on Making Iron Nails
    The production process and product types of the Shenyang Wire Factory are relatively simple. In the past, some workers believed that the simple physical labor of making iron nails, pulling iron wire, and pressing wire rods was too tiring and had no prospects for development. They felt that they were not as good as machinists and fitters in machine factories, who could learn skills and be successful everywhere. Some workers even requested to change jobs or leave the factory. This time, in the in-depth campaign to increase production and practice economy, the factory organized five exhibition halls on increasing production and practicing economy based on the factory's production development over the past four years and the current problems. After visiting the exhibition hall, the workers saw that their products were in great demand everywhere. Take iron nails as an example, they are almost indispensable in national defense industry and heavy industry, in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, construction of tall buildings, etc. The workers happily said, "Our products are great and amazing!" He Guangru used to think: Our work is not as good as making shapers, lathes, and drills in machine factories, so he wanted to leave the factory. But after visiting the exhibition hall, he deeply realized that the products of the wire factory are an indispensable part of the motherland's economic construction. He said that he must learn from the factory's labor models and do a good job in production. (Zhang Zhaofu)

    Workers Handed Over "Small Warehouses"
    In the past, the Fuzhou Repair Factory's management system was not sound enough, and many workers in the workshop were unwilling to return the old materials and unused new materials replaced during repairs to the material warehouse. Many production teams had their own "small warehouses." The engine team had accumulated hundreds of spare parts for major and minor repairs, far exceeding actual needs. One apprentice accumulated more gauze than the warehouse inventory. Some teams still had surplus gasoline and oil available, but they still received monthly quotas of fuel oil. The materials accumulated in these "small warehouses" amounted to more than 20 million yuan. After the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the workers knew that doing so was hoarding and wasting state funds, and they all handed over their "small warehouses."

    The Construction Company of the Hydroelectric Power General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and created a lifting beam frame, which is used in conjunction with light rails and winches to solve the most difficult problem for general construction sites: the lifting, transportation, and installation of prefabricated components, which greatly enhances the power of the machines. This is a great increase in production and economy. The company used this equipment at the Liupukeng construction site in Beijing to assemble more than 20,000 prefabricated reinforced concrete components for a five-story building in two months. The picture shows the company using the created lifting beam frame to install prefabricated concrete floor slabs. (Gu Gongmin)

    增产节约的新成就
    改进碾米方法提高出米率
    浙江省地方国营嵊县第四稻谷加工厂的职工提出了“多产一粒是一粒、多救一颗是一颗”的口号，运用“快速轻碾”方法，经常检修风车，不使米碎漏入糠里，这样每百斤稻谷平均可碾出白米七十斤左右，比以前增加了两斤。该厂十月份平均每天碾稻谷约两万斤，以每百斤多产米两斤计算，每天就可使农民增加大米四百斤的收入，以一年工作三百天算，就可增加十二万斤左右的大米。所以附近农民都非常乐意把稻谷挑来加工，十月份该厂超额完成了生产计划和财务计划。（沈楚益）
    八个工作日完成全月钻探任务
    湖南茶陵铁厂勘探队的钻探工人不分昼夜、不避风雨、积极热情地工作着。第十三号钻机的工人，在九月上旬，以八个工作日，在井深一百七十六公尺起钻进八十点三四公尺，岩心采取率达到百分之七十六，超额完成了全月任务。（李惠钧）
    提前完成脱水管安装
    石景山钢铁厂为了降低洗煤水分，以缩短成焦时间，提高焦炭产量和延长焦炉的寿命，决定在洗煤车间脱水槽中安装脱水管。这个工程由该厂工程公司加工厂承担，预计三个月完成。因为加工厂的职工，认识到了提前完成任务，使它早日投入生产，就是响应增产节约号召的实际行动，所以纷纷开动脑筋，找窍门，改进操作方法等等，结果提前四十三天完成了任务。这一工程提前完成可增产焦炭一千吨，价值三亿余元。（薛新珩）
    试炼“高速钢”成功
    太原矿山机器厂在增产节约竞赛中，工程师姬九韶与工人密切合作，试炼“高速钢”成功，解决了全厂刀具不足的困难。经过实际化验，质量已达到合格率的标准。
    高速钢是一种高级工具钢，它在机器工厂里用途很广，各种车刀、洗刀、轧滚刀、丝锥、丝板等都是用“高速钢”制成的。现在，他们已经制成一批车刀，准备大量制造各种工具投入生产，以保证增产节约计划超额完成。
    绥远甘草厂连创新纪录
    国营绥远甘草厂开展增产节约竞赛后，连创生产新纪录。化验室人员提出在浸草桶中加少许土碱，缩短了六个小时以上的浸草时间；制膏车间刘老虎小组的工人，找着了窍门，从原来每班生产一百公斤膏子，提高到二百零一公斤；冯富旺小组研究了刘老虎小组的经验，认为除半成品的包密需要大以外，还须在操作中勤搅拌，使膏子多接触空气，他们用这一办法，在十月十四、十六两日，连续创造了每班生产二百二十四公斤和二百四十二公斤的新纪录，最高的一日，达到二百七十一公斤，质量还合乎标准。制膏车间不断提高生产效率的事例鼓舞了其他车间的工人。木工组就提出了“制膏车间出多少膏子，我们供应多少箱子”的口号，现在他们生产效率比以前提高了一倍多。
    看了展览馆，安心打铁钉
    沈阳线材厂的生产过程和产品种类都是比较单纯的，过去有些工人认为打铁钉、拔铁丝、压盘条这种单纯体力劳动太累，又没有发展前途，不如机器厂车工钳工，学好技术到处吃得开，甚至有一些工人要求调换工作或退厂。这次厂里在深入开展增产节约竞赛中，根据厂里四年来生产发展情况和当前存在的问题，办了五个增产节约展览馆。工人们经过参观展览馆以后，看到自己生产出来的东西，到处都非常需要，就拿铁钉来说吧，不管在国防工业和重工业，在农林、水利、交通运输、建筑高楼大厦等方面，几乎是无处不用，工人们高兴地说：“咱们的产品真伟大，了不起呀！”贺广儒过去认为：咱们这个活，不如机器厂做牛头刨、做车床钻床好，所以想跳厂，但看了展览馆以后，他深深体会到线材厂的产品是祖国经济建设中不可缺少的东西。他表示一定要向厂里的劳动模范学习，把生产搞好。（张兆福）
    工人交出了“小仓库”
    福州修车厂过去因管理制度不够健全，车间很多工人都不愿意把修理时换下来的旧料和没有用完的新料交还材料库，不少生产组都有了自己的“小仓库”。引擎组就积存有大修小修用的配件数百件，远远超过实际的需要，有一个学徒积存的纱布数量竟比库存还要多。有的小组明明还有剩余的汽油、机油可用，还要按月去领定额油料。这些“小仓库”中所积存的材料，约有二千多万元。增产节约运动开展以后，工人们知道这样做是积压和浪费了国家资金，都纷纷把“小仓库”交了出来。（附图片）
    燃料工业部水电总局建筑公司学习了苏联的先进经验，创造了一种起重梁架，将起重梁架和轻轨及卷扬机配合使用，解决了一般工地所最感困难的预制构件起重、运输和安装的问题，大大发挥了机器的力量。这是个很大的增产节约。该公司在北京六铺坑工地利用这项设备，两个月中，装配了高达五层建筑两万余块的预制钢筋混凝土构件工作。图为该公司正在使用所创造的起重梁架，安装预制混凝土楼板工作的情况。（顾公敏）
