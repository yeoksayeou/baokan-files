A Day Never to Be Forgotten
Yang Zengyi, Head of the Construction Teaching and Research Group, Department of Civil Engineering, Tsinghua University
Lecturer Lu Qian

December 3, 1952, is a day that all working comrades of the Construction Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University will never forget. On this day, our respected Soviet construction expert, Professor V.K. Sadovich, came to our school. From that day on, we began to move forward by leaps and bounds under his enthusiastic and selfless help and guidance.

At that time, it was after the ideological remolding study of teachers and the adjustment of departments, and the teachers were actively and consciously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. From the older professors to the young teaching assistants who had just started working, everyone was determined to train themselves into excellent people's teachers. However, the old and backward teaching methods and bourgeois teaching thoughts were difficult to completely overcome for a while. Although everyone concentrated their efforts on intensive Russian language learning and acquired the ability to read Russian professional books, they still felt layers of difficulties on the road of learning from the Soviet Union. Facing curriculum design, production internships, graduation thesis design, and some new courses that they had never heard of before, everyone was a little worried and didn't know where to start.

Let me give you an example. The country and the people require the Department of Civil Engineering to cultivate new-type civil engineers who can both design and construct. However, the old universities' civil engineering departments did not have construction courses at all. The students trained in the past only learned a set of calculation and design methods that could not solve practical problems; they were lame and could not work independently. This created the strange saying that "Chinese people can't build." Lame engineers are the inevitable product of the old education system. At that time, foreign capitalists took advantage of this to fully exploit China's cheap labor and even more cruelly exploit the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people.

Today, what the motherland needs are new-type engineers with a people-serving perspective, combining theory and practice, and capable of solving problems independently. Students must learn theoretical and practical knowledge about construction in school. After the adjustment of departments, a series of "construction courses" appeared in the teaching plans of various majors in the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University. However, none of the old teachers had learned these courses in the past, and no one knew what content construction courses included, let alone how to teach and learn them.

However, when Tsinghua University felt it was difficult to teach construction courses, Soviet expert Professor Sadovich, who had served as the head of the Department of Civil Engineering at the Leningrad Civil Engineering Institute, was entrusted by the Soviet people to come to our school. This not only solved the problem of teaching construction courses at Tsinghua University, but also solved the problem of teaching construction courses in some other universities in China. We remember that when he had just finished his two-week journey and arrived at the school, he immediately expressed his hope to start working the next day. This noble spirit of internationalism and responsible attitude towards the revolution left an indelible impression in the hearts of each of us.

We have worked with Soviet experts for eleven months. Although the time is short, the work of the entire department has developed rapidly due to his selfless help. Professor Sadovich initially helped us recognize that the working goal of various majors in industrial universities is to cultivate new-type engineers, so all teaching work must be carried out around this goal. How can the school cultivate civil engineers who can independently solve specific problems by combining theory with practice if it doesn't teach construction courses? At his suggestion, the Construction Teaching and Research Group was established first, and he personally opened and taught construction courses for us—"Construction Technology and Construction Machinery"—to train teachers in this field for China. In the first "Construction Technology and Construction Machinery" class, he pointed out that teaching construction courses was a groundbreaking event in the history of Chinese education, which would create favorable conditions for the promotion of "good, fast, and economical" construction methods. He also said: The Soviet people must teach everyone the experience of building socialism without reservation. He also compiled lecture notes for this course for us, and gave specific and detailed guidance on how to lecture, tutor, guide course design, organize extracurricular visits and production internships, etc.

When lecturing, Professor Sadovich often connected with the actual situation in our country, inspiring students to recognize the importance of their learning tasks and their love for their major. Once he said to the students: "I graduated from university during the period of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan construction, and you are also fortunate to catch up with the opportunity to participate in China's first five-year plan construction. Therefore, you must learn from the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union. Although most of China's construction currently relies on manpower, 'mechanization and factoryization' of construction is not a distant matter. You should know that your conditions today are much more favorable than the Soviet Union's conditions back then. The Soviet people eagerly hope that China will become a socialist industrial country as soon as possible." This noble spirit of internationalism, responsible to the revolution, of the Soviet expert infected everyone who had contact with the expert, giving them infinite power in their teaching work.

In order to cultivate this nascent teaching and research group and enable it to grow rapidly, Professor Sadovich personally helped us organize the work of the entire teaching and research group. As soon as the teaching and research group was established, he pointed out that work should not only have goals, but also have plans. Under his guidance, we formulated the work plan of the teaching and research group and the individual work and advanced study plans of each teacher. At the beginning of formulating the plan, because everyone's understanding of the importance of the plan was insufficient, some comrades were even afraid of being restricted by the plan. When he discovered this situation, he patiently explained: "Write down what you want to do item by item on paper, and indicate the start and completion dates of each task, this is the plan. For example, if you want to teach a construction course next year, then write down your preparation work instead of keeping it in your heart. This will ensure that you can complete the preparations step by step, and it will also be convenient for yourself and everyone to check, so that you can complete the tasks assigned by the leadership." Today, all comrades in the teaching and research group understand the significance of the plan and how to implement it. When the teaching and research group was first established, no one knew what content the construction course had, but because we formulated and completed the plan with the help of Soviet experts, everyone is now independently teaching construction courses. After this summer vacation, our teaching and research group has opened six different construction technology courses for different majors, with a total of more than 900 students and six main lecturers.

Soviet experts not only trained teachers in construction for Tsinghua University, but also trained teachers in this field for other universities. Ten teachers who were transferred from schools across the country, after a period of study with the help of experts, were also able to teach independently. After this summer vacation, construction courses appeared in the civil engineering departments of schools in Harbin, Qingdao, Tangshan, and Tianjin. This semester, there are 23 teachers from other schools and 22 graduate students studying with Soviet experts, and they will soon return to their schools to teach construction courses.

Professor Sadovich often educated us: Linking theory with practice is one of the basic principles of Soviet education. To teach a course well, it is not only necessary to teach the course well, but also to enable students to master and consolidate their theoretical knowledge through tutoring, experiments, course design, and production internships. To this end, he personally gave us lectures, told us how to do a good job in tutoring, and led us to do course design. In order to do a good job in production internships, he personally went to Anshan Iron and Steel Company to understand the local construction situation and organize the deployment of production internship work, so that the production internship of the Department of Civil Engineering this summer achieved the expected results. In this way, under the kind guidance of Soviet experts, all the teachers of the Construction Teaching and Research Group gained a preliminary understanding of the essence of Soviet teaching methods through their own practice. Course design and production internships are no longer out of reach for everyone. At present, the teachers are confidently carrying out trial production of graduation thesis design in order to gain experience.

Professor Sadovich often asks us to strive to improve our political and ideological level. He said, "It is not enough for civil engineers to only understand technology, they must also have organizational skills. Look, how many people does an engineer on a construction site have to lead!" Everyone remembers his speech at the farewell meeting for teachers from other schools before the summer vacation: "The Construction Teaching and Research Group has stood up, which is the result of everyone's hard work. But remember, complacency is the biggest enemy hindering progress. We must work harder to consolidate and develop the achievements we have already achieved."

    一个永远不会忘记的日子
    清华大学土木系施工教研组主任　杨曾蓺  讲师  卢谦
    一九五二年十二月三日，是清华大学土木系施工教研组全体工作同志永远不会忘记的日子。在这一天，我们敬爱的苏联建筑施工专家瓦·克·萨多维奇教授来到了我们学校。从这天起，我们便在他热情无私的帮助和指导下开始大踏步地前进。
    那时正是在教师思想改造学习和院系调整后，教师们积极自觉地学习着苏联先进经验。从年老的教授到刚担任工作的青年助教，人人都立志把自己锻炼成一个优秀的人民教师。但旧的落后的教育方法和资产阶级的教学思想一时难以完全克服，虽然大家集中力量进行了俄文速成学习，取得了阅读俄文专业书籍的能力，但在学习苏联的道路上还感到层层的困难。面对着课程设计、生产实习、毕业论文设计和一些从来没听说过的新课程，大家都有些耽心，无从着手。
    举个例子来说吧，国家和人民要求土木系能培养出既能设计又能施工的新型土木工程师。但旧大学的土木系根本没有施工的课程。过去培养出来的同学只学会了一套不能解决实际问题的计算设计方法；他们是跛脚的，不能独立地进行工作。这就造成了所谓“中国人不会建设”的奇怪说法。跛脚的工程师是旧教育制度的必然的产物。当时的外国资本家，借此充分利用中国贱价的劳动力，更加凶残地剥削榨取中国劳动人民的血汗。
    今天，祖国需要的是具有为人民服务观点的，理论与实际结合，能独立解决问题的新型工程师。同学在学校里必须学到有关施工的理论和实际知识。在院系调整后，清华大学土木系各个专业的教学计划里都出现了一系列的“施工课程”。但当时旧有的教师过去都没学过这些课程，谁也不知道施工课程包括那些内容，至于怎样去教和怎样去学更是想都不敢想的事情。
    但是，当清华大学感到讲授施工课有困难时，苏联专家、曾任苏联列宁格勒土木建筑工程学院土木系系主任萨多维奇教授便受了苏联人民的委托来到我们学校了。这不仅解决了清华大学施工课的讲授问题，同时也解决了国内一些高等学校中施工课讲授的问题。我们记得，当他刚刚结束了两星期的旅途生活到达学校时，就立刻表示希望在第二天就开始工作。这种崇高的国际主义精神和对革命负责的态度在我们每个人的心中都留下了永不磨灭的印象。
    我们和苏联专家共同工作有十一个月了。虽然日期很短，但全系的工作由于他无私的帮助得到了迅速的发展。萨多维奇教授一开始便帮助我们认清工业大学各个专业的工作目标是培养新型的工程师，因此一切的教学工作都要环绕着这个目标进行。学校里不讲施工课怎能培养出理论联系实际的能独立解决具体问题的土木工程师呢？在他的建议下首先成立了施工教研组，他并亲自给我们开设和讲授施工方面的课程——“建筑施工技术与建筑机械”，为中国培养这方面的师资。在第一次的“建筑施工技术与建筑机械”课上，他指出：讲施工课在中国教育史上是破天荒第一次，这将为“又好、又快、又省”施工方法的推广创造有利条件。他还说：苏联人民一定要把建设社会主义的经验毫无保留地教给大家。他并为我们编写了这门课程的讲义，而且对如何讲课、辅导、指导课程设计、组织课外参观和生产实习等，都作了具体细致的指导。
    萨多维奇教授在讲课时经常联系我国的实际情况，启发同学认识自己学习任务的重要和对所学专业的热爱。有一次他向同学说：“我大学毕业时正是苏联第一个五年计划建设的时期，而你们也正好幸福地赶上参加中国第一个五年计划建设的机会。因此你们一定要很好地学习苏联先进的建设经验。虽然目前中国的施工大多还依靠人力，但‘机械化和工厂化’的施工并不是遥远的事情。要知道你们今天的条件比起苏联当年的条件要有利得多，苏联人民热望中国尽快地成为一个社会主义的工业国。”苏联专家这种崇高的对革命负责的国际主义精神，感染了每一个和专家接触过的人，使他们在教学工作上获得无限的力量。
    为了培养这个新生的教研组，使它得以迅速成长，萨多维奇教授亲自帮助我们组织起整个教研组的工作。教研组刚一成立，他就指出工作不但要有目标，而且还要有计划。在他的指导下，我们订出教研组的工作计划和各个教师的个人工作和进修计划。开始订立计划时，由于大家对计划的重要性认识不足，有的同志甚至怕受计划的限制。他发现这种情况时，便耐心地解释说：“把你要作的事情逐项写在纸上，并注明各项工作的开始和完成日期，这就是计划。例如你明年要讲施工课，那么把你的准备工作写出来而不留在心里，这样就可保证有步骤地完成各项准备工作，同时也便于自己和大家检查，使自己能完成领导方面所交付的任务。”今天，教研组全体同志都了解到计划的意义和怎样执行计划。教研组刚成立时，没有一个人知道施工课有那些内容，但由于我们在苏联专家的帮助下订立了和完成了计划，现在每个人都已在独立讲施工课了。今年暑假后，我们的教研组已开出不同专业的六种施工技术课，学生总计有九百多人，主讲教师有六人。
    苏联专家不仅为清华大学培养施工方面的师资，而且为其他高等学校培养了这方面的教师。从全国各地学校调来学习的十位教师，在专家的帮助下经过一个时期的学习，也都能独立授课了。今年暑假后在哈尔滨、青岛、唐山、天津各地学校的土木系中都出现了施工课程。这学期跟苏联专家学习的有二十三位外校教师和二十二位研究生，不久他们也将回校讲授施工课程。
    萨多维奇教授经常教育我们：理论联系实际是苏联教育的基本原则之一。要教好一门课，不仅需要把课讲好，还要通过辅导、实验、课程设计、生产实习等方式使学生熟练、巩固他们所学到的理论知识。为此他亲自给我们上课，告诉我们怎样做好辅导工作，又领导我们做课程设计。为了做好生产实习，他亲自到鞍山钢铁公司了解当地的施工情况，组织布置生产实习工作，使今年暑假土木系的生产实习取得了预期的成绩。这样，在苏联专家亲切的指导下，施工教研组全体教师通过自己的实践，对苏联教学方法的实质有了初步的认识。课程设计和生产实习对于大家再也不是可望而不可即了。目前，教师们正信心百倍地进行毕业论文设计的试作，以期取得经验。
    萨多维奇教授经常要求我们努力提高政治思想水平，他说：“土木工程师不是只懂技术就够了，他还必须具备组织能力。你看，工地上一个工程师要领导多少群众工作呀！”我们每一个人都记得他在暑假前欢送外校教师的会上的讲话：“施工教研组已经站起来了，这是大家努力工作的结果。但要记住，自满情绪是阻碍前进的最大的敌人。我们要更加努力地工作，巩固和发展已经获得的成绩”。
