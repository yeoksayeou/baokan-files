(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th) Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: At today's subcommittee meeting between the two sides, the Korean-Chinese side exposed the US side's plot to delay the convening of the political conference until after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody period, so as to forcibly detain prisoners of war as cannon fodder. At today's subcommittee discussing the time issue, the US side rejected the Korean-Chinese side's reasonable suggestion to quickly convene the political conference, and opposed initially determining the convening of the political conference four weeks after the two sides' talks reached an agreement on the first agenda item. The US side suggested convening the political conference no later than forty-two days after all issues on the agenda of the two sides' talks have been fully agreed upon, and this "suggestion" is also dependent on the assumption that all agenda items are agreed upon within ten days. The US side's "new suggestion" today proves that Dean's statement on the 16th that the political conference would be held on December 15th was just a nice phrase used to deceive the world.

In fact, the agreement on the agenda between the two sides was delayed by the US side for twenty days. And in the four days since the Korean-Chinese side put forward constructive suggestions on the form and members of the political conference, the US side has not put forward any suggestions to solve the member issue. Obviously, the purpose of the US government representative's delaying the talks is to cooperate with the US side's plan to completely undermine the explanation work and oppose the extension of the explanation period, so that the political conference cannot discuss the handling of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war after the explanation period expires. US Secretary of State Dulles recently publicly announced that regardless of whether the political conference is convened or not, the US side will "release" prisoners of war on January 22nd.

Executing such a delaying plan, US government representative Dean deliberately distorted the constructive suggestions of the Korean-Chinese side on the form and members of the political conference today. In addition to the eleven inexplicable questions he raised on the 18th, he raised six more "questions" and "assumptions." Then, he asked the Korean-Chinese government representatives to "confirm that these assumptions are correct." He once again resorted to the clichés of American propaganda to slander the Soviet Union, and continued to openly oppose the participation of Asian neutral countries in the political conference. Qi Shifu representative seriously warned Dean: Your side seems to have no interest in formal talks, and is deliberately using slander to undermine this meeting. If your side has no intention of continuing this meeting, your side should make it clear and bear all the responsibility for undermining this meeting. Qi Shifu representative said: Precisely because the Soviet Union is a great peaceful country loved by the people of the whole world, a handful of warmongers are constantly slandering the Soviet Union, and anti-Soviet slanders have become the trademark of warmongers. Qi Shifu representative questioned Dean: You say the Soviet Union is a belligerent country. Then I ask you, is the United States currently at war with the Soviet Union? Dean could not answer.

Dean today also insulted Asian neutral countries, claiming: "I can take care of my own affairs better than my neighbors," and said that the Asian neutral countries nominated by our side are at least three thousand one hundred miles away from Korea. Qi Shifu representative pointed out: The US side's ridicule and insult of Asian neutral countries is completely intolerable. The US side's remarks that despise Asian neutral countries are consistent with the US side's aggressive behavior of traveling thousands of miles to establish military bases in Asian countries.

Another way Dean used to kill time today was to read aloud at the meeting the full text of the two "suggestions" he made three days ago to prevent neutral countries from participating in the political conference, although these two "suggestions" had already been firmly and decisively rejected by the Korean-Chinese side. He then listed some European and American cities without touching the edge of the subject, asking the Korean-Chinese side to choose one as the location for the political conference. He even proposed Madrid, the nest of the fascist Franco, as the meeting location.

The US side's lack of sincerity in the talks can also be proven by the fact that Dean could not name a single US newspaper that published the joint communiqué on the agreement between the two sides. The joint communiqué on the agreement on the agenda and discussion methods was discussed and passed on November 14th, but the US side did not publish it even in the official US Information Service for ulterior motives. Dean claimed yesterday that some US news reports had published the joint communiqué, and promised to provide an answer today, but he could not provide a single example today. The Korean-Chinese government representative protested against this violation of the agreement by the US side, and pointed out that this serious violation of the agreement by the US side makes the common agreement between the two sides untrustworthy.

Qi Shifu representative earnestly advised the US side to consider our side's suggestions and not to delay the member issue any further. Otherwise, the US side must bear all the responsibility for delaying the political conference.

### 美方使用各种手法企图拖延召开政治会议  以配合美方破坏解释工作扣留战俘的阴谋

    美方使用各种手法企图拖延召开政治会议以配合美方破坏解释工作扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝中方面在今天双方会谈的小组委员会上，揭露了美方企图把政治会议的召开拖延到中立国遣返委员会看管期满以后以便强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰的阴谋。美方今天在讨论时间问题的小组委员会上，拒绝了朝中方面迅速召开政治会议的合理建议，反对初步确定在双方会谈就第一项议程达成协议后的四周后召开政治会议。美方建议在双方会谈议程上各项问题全部达成协议后不迟于四十二天召开政治会议，而且这个“建议”还有赖于全部议程项目不迟于十天内达成协议的假定。美方今天的“新建议”，证明迪安十六日提出在十二月十五日召开政治会议，只不过是一句用来向世界进行欺骗宣传的漂亮话。
    事实上，双方关于议程的协议，就曾经被美方拖延了二十天之久。而在朝中方面提出关于政治会议的形式和成员问题的建设性建议以来的四天中，美方也一直没有提出任何解决成员问题的建议。显然，美国政府代表的拖延双方会谈的目的，就在于配合美方完全破坏解释工作和反对延长解释期限的计划，使政治会议在解释期满后仍不能讨论不直接遣返战俘的处理问题。美国国务卿杜勒斯最近已公开宣布不管政治会议召开与否，美方将在一月二十二日“释放”战俘。
    美国政府代表迪安执行着这样的拖延计划，今天故意歪曲朝中方面关于政治会议形式与成员问题的建设性建议，在他十八日提出的十一个莫名其妙的问题之外，又提出了六个“问题”和“假定”。然后，他又要求朝中政府代表来“证实这些假定是正确的”。他再次搬出美国宣传的滥调来诽谤苏联，并继续公开地反对亚洲中立国家参加政治会议。奇石福代表严重地警告迪安：你方似乎没有兴趣进行正式的会谈，因而蓄意用诬蔑来破坏这个会议。如果你方已无意再继续此次会谈，你方应该明白作出表示，并负担破坏此次会谈的一切责任。奇石福代表说：正因为苏联是全世界人民所敬爱的伟大的和平国家，所以一小撮战争贩子无时无刻不在诬蔑苏联，反苏谰言已成为战争贩子的商标。奇石福代表质问迪安：你说苏联是一个交战国家。那么我问你，美国现在与苏联处于交战状态吗？迪安不能回答。
    迪安今天又侮辱亚洲中立国家，他声称：“我比我的邻居能更好地照顾我自己的事务”，并说我方所提名的亚洲中立国家至少也在离朝鲜三千一百英里之外。奇石福代表指出：美方对亚洲中立国家的嘲弄和侮辱是完全不能容忍的。美方轻视亚洲中立国家的言论，和美方远涉万里重洋到亚洲国家建立军事基地的侵略行为是一致的。
    迪安今天用来消磨时间的另一个办法是，在会上宣读了他在三天前提出的阻止中立国家参加政治会议的两个“建议”的全文，虽然这两个“建议”早已被朝中方面坚决地、断然地予以拒绝。他接着不着边际地列举了一些欧洲和美洲的城市，要求朝中方面选定一个来作为政治会议的地点，他甚至提出法西斯佛朗哥的巢穴马德里来作为会议地点。
    美方对双方会谈缺乏诚意，还可以从迪安举不出一家刊登了双方协议发表的联合公报的美方报纸得到证明。双方关于议程和讨论方法的协议的联合公报，是在十一月十四日讨论和通过的，但是美方为了不可告人的目的，连官方的美国新闻处都没有予以发表。迪安昨天声称有些美方新闻报道曾经发表联合公报，并答应今天提出回答，但是他今天却举不出一个例子来。朝中政府代表对美方这一违反协议的行为提出抗议，并指出美方这种违反协议的严重行为，使双方的共同协议成为不可信托。
    奇石福代表郑重劝告美方考虑我方的建议，不要使成员问题再拖延下去。否则，美方就必须担负拖延政治会议的全部责任。
