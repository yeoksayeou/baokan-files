    Heilongjiang Bairin Right Banner Reaps Unprecedented Harvest
    Farmers Sell Grain to Buy Vehicles and Horses, Expanding Reproduction
    This autumn, Bairin Right Banner in Heilongjiang Province achieved an unprecedented harvest of crops. Farmers are universally selling grain and buying vehicles and horses in preparation for expanding reproduction.
    This year, Bairin Right Banner's 150,000 hectares of farmland yielded an average of 3,080 jin of grain per hectare, exceeding the normal yield by 52.9%, exceeding last year's yield by 19.4%, and exceeding this year's planned yield by 9.12%. After the autumn harvest, every farmer's house is full of grain. For example, in Xinghui Village, District 16, among the 81 farming households, 3 households harvested over 100 shi of grain, 5 households harvested over 80 shi, 17 households harvested over 40 shi, and the rest harvested over 20 shi. After achieving an unprecedented harvest, in order to buy vehicles and horses, improve sideline production this winter, and expand reproduction next year, the farmers are actively selling good grain to the state. New grain is now on the market. The Bairin Right Banner Grain Company can purchase an average of more than 60 large carts of new grain every day, and rural supply and marketing cooperatives have also begun to purchase new grain. According to statistics from the Grain Company, among the purchased grain, special-grade grain accounts for 5.3%, first-grade grain accounts for 88.4%, second-grade grain accounts for 5.7%, and third-grade grain accounts for 0.6%. Among them, 80% of the soybeans are special-grade. After selling their grain, the farmers go to department stores or supply and marketing cooperatives to select the goods they want. The 550 vehicles prepared by the Bairin Right Banner Cooperative Federation have already been bought up by the farmers. Farmers across the banner have bought 335 horses. The Banner Federation and the Native Produce Company bought 500 head of cattle, which have been bought up by farmers in seven districts. Farmers in the other eight districts frequently write letters requesting the Banner Federation to prepare vehicles, horses, cattle, and sheep for them. Many farmers in District 10 are requesting to sign joint contracts with the Zhenxi Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Farmers in Shitoujingzi Village in that district told the director of the supply and marketing cooperative: "I will give the grain to the cooperative, and the cooperative must buy me a good horse."
    Currently, the Bairin Right Banner Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is strengthening its leadership over the state-owned commercial and cooperative material supply work, and is reorganizing a large number of goods. All companies and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have increased their original supply plans. The Bairin Right Banner Federation has sent people out to purchase 300 horses, 3,000 calves, 500 sheep, and one trainload of vehicle materials to meet the purchase demands of farmers after selling their grain.

    黑龙江白城县农作物获得空前丰收
    农民卖粮食添车马扩大再生产
    黑龙江省白城县秋季作物获得空前丰收，农民普遍出卖粮食、添车买马准备扩大再生产。
    白城县十五万垧大田，今年每垧平均产粮三千零八十斤，超过常年产量百分之五十二点九，超过去年产量百分之十九点四，超过今年计划产量百分之九点一二。秋收以后，家家农民都是粮食满仓。如十六区兴会村八十一户农民，打百石粮以上的有三户，八十石粮以上的有五户，四十石粮以上的十七户，其余都在二十石以上。农民在获得空前丰收以后，为了添车买马，搞好今冬副业和扩大明年再生产，纷纷把好粮卖给国家。现在新粮已经上市，白城县粮食公司平均每日能收购新粮六十多大车，农村供销合作社也已开始收购新粮。根据粮食公司统计，收购的粮食中，特等粮占百分之五点三，一等粮占百分之八十八点四，二等粮占百分之五点七，三等粮占百分之零点六。其中大豆百分之八十是特等的。农民卖粮后就到百货公司或供销合作社挑选合意货物。白城子合作社联合社准备的五百五十辆车，已被农民买光。全县农民已买进三百三十五匹马。县联社与土产公司买进五百头牛，已被七个区的农民买光。另八个区的农民经常写信要求县联社给他们准备车、马、牛、羊。十区很多农民要求与镇西供销合作社订立结合合同，该区石头井子村农民找供销社主任说：“我把粮食给合作社，合作社一定要给我买一匹好马。”
    现在，中共白城县委正加强对国营商业与合作社物资供应工作的领导，重新组织大批货物。各公司、基层供销社都提高了原订供应计划，白城县联社已派人出外采购马三百匹、小牛三千头、羊五百只、车材一火车，以满足农民出卖粮食后的购买要求。（方作新）
