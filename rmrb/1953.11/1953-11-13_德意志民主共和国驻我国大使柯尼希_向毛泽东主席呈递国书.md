Ambassador Koenig’s Eulogy

Respected Chairman:

With great pleasure, I present to you the Letter of Credence from the President of the German Democratic Republic, appointing me as the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

In the four years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, the sincere friendship and close cooperation between our two countries have continuously developed and strengthened. The upgrading of our two countries' diplomatic missions to embassies and the mutual dispatch of ambassadors will help to further consolidate and develop political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. This not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of our two peoples, but also has great political significance for the struggle to safeguard world peace, to smash the conspiracies of imperialist warmongers, and to develop and consolidate the great world peace and democracy camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union. Not only the people of the German Democratic Republic, but also all peace-loving forces in Germany, are watching the People's Republic of China with admiration and joy, noting its tremendous achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction. The People's Republic of China is a solid and firm fortress of peace and democracy in the Far East. The struggle and victory of the Chinese people are a shining example for all peoples who are fighting against imperialist exploitation and oppression. The victory of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the brave Korean people fighting side by side against the imperialist aggressors particularly inspires all patriotic people in Germany to further strengthen their struggle for a peaceful resolution of the most important issue in Europe, namely, to restore Germany's unity on a democratic basis and to conclude a just peace treaty with Germany.

Respected Chairman, the German people know that they can obtain the sympathy and support of the great Chinese people in this just struggle, as well as in the political and economic consolidation of the German Democratic Republic. Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the great and selfless assistance that the People's Republic of China has consistently given to the German Democratic Republic. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic will also, in the same spirit, do their utmost to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation.

Chairman, please allow me to assure you that, in my position as Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic, I will dedicate all my strength to further consolidating and developing the friendly relations between our two countries. I am deeply convinced that I will receive your help and support, and that of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in carrying out this important task.

Please allow me to convey to you the heartfelt respect of the President of the German Democratic Republic and wish you good health and longevity.

Chairman Mao’s Reply

Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence from the President of the German Democratic Republic that you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

Over the past four years, the friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have greatly developed. With the upgrading of diplomatic missions between the two countries to embassies, not only will the close cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields be further enhanced, but it will also be of great significance for consolidating the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

The significant achievements of the German people in national construction and in the struggle for peace have made the German Democratic Republic a strong fortress of peace and democracy for all of Germany and an important factor in safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. I believe that with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, with the sympathy and support of the people's democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world, the German people's just struggle to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany will surely achieve greater victory. In this struggle, the German people will always receive the full support of the Chinese people.

Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to take up your post as the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China. In your work to consolidate the friendly cooperation between China and Germany, you will receive the full support of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

I wish you complete success in your work.

    柯尼希大使颂词敬爱的主席同志：
    我怀着十分愉快的心情，谨向您呈递德意志民主共和国总统任命我为德意志民主共和国驻中华人民共和国中央人民政府特命全权大使的国书。
    在德意志民主共和国与中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系以来的四年中，我们两国间的真诚友谊和亲密合作不断地得到了发展和巩固。我们两国外交使团改为大使馆并互派大使，将有助于德意志民主共和国与中华人民共和国之间政治、经济和文化合作的进一步巩固和发展。这不仅符合我们两国人民的利益与愿望，而且对维护世界和平的斗争，对粉碎帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋，对发展和巩固以强大苏联为首的伟大世界和平民主阵营也有着重大的政治意义。不仅德意志民主共和国的人民，而且全德爱好和平的力量都满怀着赞慕和欢欣的心情注视着中华人民共和国，注视着它在政治、经济和文化方面的巨大建设成就。中华人民共和国是远东和平与民主的稳固和坚定的堡垒。中国人民的斗争和胜利对于正在进行反对帝国主义剥削和压迫的各国人民是一个光辉的榜样。英雄的中国人民志愿军和勇敢的朝鲜人民并肩战胜帝国主义侵略者的胜利，特别鼓舞着德国所有的爱国人士更进一步地加强他们争取和平解决欧洲最重要问题的斗争，即在民主的基础上恢复德国的统一并缔结公正的对德和约。
    敬爱的主席同志，德国人民知道：他们在这个正义的斗争中，以及在德意志民主共和国政治与经济的巩固中，定能获得伟大中国人民的同情与支持。请允许我对于中华人民共和国经常给与德意志民主共和国的重大和无私援助向您表示衷心的感谢。德意志民主共和国政府和人民亦将以同样的精神竭尽全力加强相互的帮助和合作。
    主席同志，请允许我向您保证：我在德意志民主共和国大使的岗位上，将为进一步巩固与发展我们两国之间的友好关系而贡献出我的全部力量。我深信：我在执行这一重要的任务时，将获得您和中华人民共和国中央人民政府的帮助与支持。
    请允许我向您转达德意志民主共和国总统的衷心敬意，并祝您身体健康，万寿无疆。
    毛主席答词大使同志：
    我很高兴地接受您所呈递的德意志民主共和国总统的国书，并衷心感谢您的祝贺。
    四年来，中华人民共和国与德意志民主共和国之间的友好合作关系有了极大发展。在两国外交使团改为大使馆后，不但两国之间政治、经济、文化各方面的密切合作将更加增强，并且对于巩固以伟大苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营有着极大的意义。
    德国人民在国家建设工作及争取和平的斗争中的重大成就，已使德意志民主共和国成为全德和平及民主力量的坚强堡垒和维护欧洲及世界和平的重要因素。我相信：在伟大苏联的援助下，在各人民民主国家及世界爱好和平人民的同情与支持下，德国人民为建立统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的正义斗争，必将获得更大的胜利。在这一斗争中，德国人民将永远得到中国人民的全力的支持。
    大使同志，我热烈地欢迎您出任德意志民主共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使。在您为巩固德中两国友好合作的工作中，您将得到我和中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。
    我谨祝您在工作中获得完全的成功。
