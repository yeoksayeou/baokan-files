Xinhua News Agency, 18th. In the second month of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, more state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines across the country exceeded their national production plans or increase production and practice economy plans for October. According to incomplete statistics from eight cities including Harbin, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, Qingdao, and Nanjing, and the two provinces of Suiyuan and Hunan, more than 300 major factories and mines completed their October production plans or increase production and practice economy plans. September was originally the best month for industrial production in Tianjin this year, with 69 of the city's 84 major factories exceeding their September production plans. But in October, this situation developed further; 71 factories in the city not only completed their October production plans, but also completed their increase production and practice economy plans. Fushun City's increase production plans for 22 major products in October, including 19 such as raw coal, crude oil, gasoline, electricity, steel ingots, electrical porcelain, ammonium sulfate, and paraffin wax, were exceeded. The output of important products all increased compared to September, with the output of steel ingots increasing by 13.9 percent. The increase production plans of various factories in Harbin City in October were all relatively advanced, so the 35 factories that exceeded their October increase production plans also excellently completed the national production plans for the entire month. The number of factories in Qingdao City that comprehensively completed their plans increased by 11 in October compared to the third quarter. Among the 22 major state-owned factories and mines in Hunan Province, including electric power, non-ferrous metals, machinery, and manganese, 18 completed their product plans in October, an increase of four compared to September. Among the 42 major factories and mines in Chongqing, 33 completed their plans, also an increase compared to September.

In October, many factories and mines strengthened their technical management work while implementing work plans and continuing to promote advanced experiences. For example, the iron smelting workshop of Daye Steel Plant unified operating methods through meetings of the same type of workers, and also took measures such as using small coke pieces to increase furnace temperature, which increased daily output by 16.9 percent. Some state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao City conducted technical measurements among workers, and organized workers to observe each other's operating methods, so that workers with backward techniques could also carry out production in accordance with technical operating procedures; some factories implemented technical measures plans to solve problems such as non-standard cotton slivers from carding machines, high yarn breakage rates, and short cloth lengths. Therefore, all eight state-owned cotton textile factories in the city completed their increase production plans in October, and seven of them comprehensively achieved their planned targets for output value, output, quality, and cost. Harbin Rubber Factory implemented worker technical qualification certificates, and conducted daily and weekly inspections and records, which ensured the implementation of the newly formulated operating procedures, and greatly improved the quality and output of the factory's products. After taking specific technical measures, the workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory comprehensively exceeded their October production plan without increasing labor intensity. The workers said: "This time, we completed the task easily and happily."

The rationalization proposal movement of employees also developed more widely and universally in October. By the end of October, employees of more than 40 local state-owned factories in Tianjin City had put forward more than 2,100 rationalization proposals, of which more than 1,200 have been implemented. Employees of Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory in Hunan also put forward more than 600 rationalization proposals in October, of which 107 proposals, after being implemented, can save more than 1,700 man-hours, providing a strong guarantee for completing the plan. After Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory adopted the employee's suggestion to improve the tablet pressing operation method, the output of tablets increased by more than 3 million in October. After the Ningchang Factory of the joint state-private Yongli Chemical Industry Company adopted the suggestion of adjusting the cold air pressure in the power workshop, it can also save more than 15,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month.

Another sign of the further deepening of the increase production and practice economy campaign is that the office staff of many factories and mines also actively participated in the competition. They went deep into the workshops to help solve key problems, so that production potential was further developed. The office staff of the state-owned Qingdao No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory paid attention to the rational use of raw cotton in the October competition, and the value saved in three weeks was more than 100 million yuan. Relevant office staff of Zibo Hongshan Coal Mine went deep into the site to cooperate in the verification and investigation of work plans, so that tunneling, mining, and transportation work gradually became balanced.

    增产节约运动的第二个月
    全国有更多的厂矿超额完成计划
    【新华社十八日讯】在增产节约运动的第二个月，全国各地有更多的国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿超额完成了十月份的国家生产计划或增产节约计划。根据哈尔滨、太原、天津、武汉、重庆、昆明、青岛、南京等八个城市和绥远、湖南两省的不完全统计，就有三百多个主要厂矿完成了十月份的生产计划或增产节约计划。九月份本来是天津市今年工业生产情况最好的一个月，全市八十四个主要工厂中有六十九个超额完成了九月份生产计划。但到十月份，这种情况又有了发展；全市有七十一个工厂不但完成了十月份生产计划，而且也完成了增产节约计划。抚顺市十月份二十二种主要产品的增产计划，有原煤、原油、汽油、电、钢锭、电瓷、硫铵、石蜡等十九种超额完成。重要产品的产量都比九月份提高，其中钢锭的产量就提高了百分之十三点九。哈尔滨市各工厂十月份增产计划都订得比较先进，因此超额完成十月份增产计划的三十五个工厂，也都出色地完成了全月国家生产计划。青岛市全面完成计划的工厂，十月份比第三季度增加了十一个。湖南省电业、有色金属、机械、锰等二十二个主要国营厂矿中，十月份完成产品计划的有十八个，比九月份增加了四个。重庆市四十二个主要厂矿中，完成计划的有三十三个，比九月份也有增加。
      十月份，很多厂矿在贯彻作业计划和继续推广先进经验的同时，加强了技术管理工作。如大冶钢厂炼铁车间通过同工种会议，统一了操作法，又采取打小焦炭块等措施来提高炉膛温度，使日产量又提高了百分之十六点九。青岛市有的国营棉纺织厂在职工中进行了技术测定，并组织职工互相观摩操作方法，使技术落后的工人也能按技术操作规程进行生产；有的厂实现技术措施计划，解决了梳棉机出的棉条不合规格、细纱断头率高、布短码等问题。因此全市八个国营棉纺织厂十月份都完成了增产计划，其中有七个厂的产值、产量、质量、成本更全面地达到了计划指标。哈尔滨橡胶厂推行工人技术合格证，每日每周进行检查、记录，保证了新订操作规程的实行，使该厂的产品质量和产量都大大提高。国营上海第二棉纺织厂在采取具体技术措施后，职工们并未增加劳动强度就全面超额地完成了十月份生产计划。工人们说：“这次是轻松愉快地完成了任务。”
    职工们的合理化建议运动，在十月份也开展得更加广泛普遍。天津市四十多个地方国营工厂的职工，到十月底共提了两千一百多件合理化建议，其中有一千二百多件已经实现。湖南湘潭电机厂职工在十月份中也提了六百多件合理化建议，其中一百零七件建议实行后，可以节省一千七百多个工时，为完成计划提供了有力保证。南京制药厂采纳职工建议改进压片操作法后，十月份药片增产了三百多万片。公私合营永利化学工业公司宁厂采纳了调节动力车间冷风压力的建议后，每月也可节约用电一万五千多度。
    增产节约运动更深入一步的另一个标志，是很多厂矿的科室人员也积极参加了竞赛。他们深入车间帮助解决关键问题，使得生产潜力得到进一步发挥。国营青岛第一棉纺织厂的科室人员，在十月份的竞赛中注意了合理使用原棉，三周内节约的价值就有一亿多元。淄博洪山煤矿有关科室人员深入现场，配合进行作业计划的核对和调查工作，使得掘进、采煤、运输等工作逐渐走上平衡。
