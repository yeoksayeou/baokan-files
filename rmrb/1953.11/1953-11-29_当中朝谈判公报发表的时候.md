The Deepest Impression

From the day Marshal Kim Il-sung arrived in Beijing, the Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers recuperating in a certain hospital in Beijing seemed to be expecting something. They read the newspapers more diligently and listened to the radio more often. Finally, the Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué and the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement were announced in the newspaper on November 24. These heroes who had defended the Kaesong Neutral Zone and protected Shangganling were particularly excited when they saw and heard this news. How could they not be excited? They risked their lives and shed precious blood precisely for the Sino-Korean friendship mentioned in the communiqué and the agreement!

Volunteer Army soldier Jia Zhongming immediately recalled the specific scenes of Chinese and Korean troops fighting side by side on the battlefield. It was during the Fifth Battle that their squad was defending the Huangcaoling position and was completely surrounded by the enemy. Just as they were running out of ammunition and food and were unable to hold on, a Korean People's Guerrilla force suddenly broke through the enemy's encirclement and finally cooperated with them to repel the enemy's attack. Jia Zhongming said excitedly: "During these days of recuperation back home, I think of the bravery of the Korean People's Army every day, of the support of the Korean people for the Volunteer Army, and of the painful lives they suffered during the war. When I heard that we were going to send 80 billion yuan worth of things to help the Korean people build their country, I was particularly happy. The Chinese and Korean people are as close as flesh and blood, this is as it should be."

Speaking of the close ties between the Chinese and Korean people, Volunteer Army soldier Mao Debao told another moving story:

It was on the night of May 17, 1951, when Cui, a platoon leader of a certain Volunteer Army company, received the task of attacking the enemy stronghold at Dashuidong. When Platoon Leader Cui led the entire platoon across Jialishan and Height 725, the problem arose: according to the map, they had already arrived at Dashuidong, but there was nothing here. Where was Dashuidong? Just as they were in great anxiety, a light suddenly appeared from the mountain stream. Platoon Leader Cui was overjoyed and immediately led a squad straight to the light.

When the old man in the house heard that the Chinese People's Volunteers had arrived, he immediately pulled Platoon Leader Cui into the house with both hands and said very excitedly: "Chinese *shalami* (people), very good!" After Platoon Leader Cui asked the liaison officer to explain the purpose of their visit, the old man was overjoyed and told Platoon Leader Cui the distance from here to Dashuidong, the location of the enemy's command post and radio station, one by one. But the old man was still not at ease. He was afraid that they would strike out in vain, so he personally led them there. As a result, the entire platoon of soldiers led by Platoon Leader Cui annihilated an enemy regimental headquarters and an entire battalion at Dashuidong.

After telling this story, the wounded soldier concluded:

"If it were not for the enthusiastic support of the Korean people, the Volunteer Army could not have won the victory in the Korean War."

Cherish the Time to Practice in China

In a beautiful small building in the Tianjin No. 4 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, there live fifteen Korean comrades who came to the factory for internships, and several Chinese technicians and translators who help them study. On the night of November 24, after a day of intense labor, translator Wu Yongshan told them about the contents of the Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué and the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. Cheers in different languages immediately filled the entire room. The Korean comrades held the Chinese comrades' hands and shouted in not very familiar Chinese: "Comrade Mao Zedong has agreed that you can all go to Korea to help more people learn technology and build Korea as beautiful as China!" The Chinese comrades replied with a smile: If possible, we want to go to Korea with you to help you build your country, maybe we can walk into socialist society together!

These fifteen Korean comrades come from different places and positions, including factory workers, rural women, and outstanding guerrillas. They are all glorious labor party members who have made contributions and won high honors in the anti-aggression war in their motherland. They did encounter many difficulties in learning technology, but the expectations of the people of the motherland urged them, and the enthusiastic and patient help of the Chinese comrades encouraged them. They finally gradually mastered the production technology. Jin Fude was originally an ordinary female worker in the Ningbian Textile Factory in North Pyongan Province. In the most difficult environment, she always completed her production tasks, guaranteed the supply to the front line, and won the glorious title of National Textile Labor Model. When she first came to China to study, she could not master the technology of operating automatic looms. So she listened to lectures with everyone during the day and went to the workshop to practice. At night, she sorted out notes, studied technology and theory in the dormitory. In the most recent internship, she was already able to manage forty automatic looms. Jin Zhenshun is a 25-year-old Korean woman, an excellent female guerrilla, who was arrested and imprisoned twice and suffered serious injuries to her head and right leg. Overworked, her head became dizzy. But she still insisted on studying with everyone, often sorting out notes until two o'clock in the morning. She said: "I want to bring China's advanced technology back to my motherland, rebuild factories on Korean soil, install machines, and let our people have good clothes to wear!"

Their spirit of hard study has moved every worker in the No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory. They feel extremely honored to be able to help the Korean people learn technology. Technicians Wang Hongnian and Zhao Shuzhen were designated as full-time teachers. At the beginning, there were no translators, and the 1951 weaving work method technical theory was complicated. They made detailed charts, put their hands there, and looked there, all drawn on the charts, until the Korean comrades understood. Sometimes, they sacrificed their evening cultural study time to help the Korean comrades review. Xian Zhennv is a young Korean girl who has never studied textiles. Zhao Shuzhen and shuttle installer Wang Meixiu taught her how to practice hand-in-hand. Now, Xian Zhennv has become an expert who can manage forty automatic looms.

In more than a month, these Korean comrades will return to Korea to participate in the restoration and construction of their motherland. Li Zhida, winner of the Third Class National Flag Medal, said: "We must cherish these times of internship in China, study harder, and build our motherland well after returning home!"

"We have another opportunity"

At Peking University, the news of the Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué and the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement spread from the radio early in the morning. Jiang Jiliang, a student in the Dialectical Materialism Teaching and Research Section of the Department of Philosophy, was particularly excited today. As early as 1950, when the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement had just begun, he signed up to join the army, but the school did not approve it, and this has always been his unfulfilled wish. Recently, his younger brother sent a letter from Korea, which aroused this wish again. Therefore, when he heard the content of the Sino-Korean negotiation communiqué, he said excitedly: "This is another opportunity." He said that he would study harder and strive to go to Korea in the future to help the Korean people's construction, just like Soviet experts helped us.

The students in the fourth grade of the Department of Biology, at this time, particularly missed the Korean students who used to live with them day and night. The Korean students' spirit of humility and hard study, and the Korean students' enthusiasm for the Chinese students, always moved them. They will never forget the scene when they saw off the Korean student Sun Bingji when he returned home. The train was about to leave, and Sun Bingji looked at the Chinese students who were about to leave. What could he leave as a souvenir? Finally, with tears in his eyes, he left the badge with the image of Kim Il-sung to the Chinese student Li Yangwen. After that, Sun Bingji continued to write letters to them. In his most recent letter, Sun Bingji also said: He hoped that they would strive to go to Korea in the future to visit the beautiful Mount Kumgang. Now, they feel that the possibility of realizing their wishes is greater. They are determined to study hard and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland to support the construction of the Korean people at any time.

Wu Shigen, a Korean student in the Chinese Language Special Training Class for Foreign Students at Peking University, had a happy glow on his face after hearing the news. He said: "Now, the Chinese government not only sends people to help build our country, but also gives us food and cloth..., the construction of our country will soon be restored quickly, and my little sister who was injured by American bandit planes will soon be able to live a happy life." The Korean students said with confidence: In order to repay Chairman Mao's care, and in order to complete the learning task given by Marshal Kim Il-sung, we must study hard and introduce the rich culture of the Chinese people to the Korean people in the future.

    当中朝谈判公报发表的时候
    张芳
    最深刻的体会
    打从金日成元帅到北京的那天起，在北京某医院休养的志愿军伤病员们，都好像在期待着什么一样，报纸看得更勤了，广播也听得更多了，终于，十一月二十四日的报纸上公布了中朝谈判公报和中朝经济及文化合作协定签订的消息。这些曾经捍卫过开城中立区的英雄们，保卫过上甘岭的英雄们，看到和听到这个消息以后，格外激动起来。怎么能不激动呢？他们冒着生命的危险，流了宝贵的鲜血，不正是为了公报中和协定中所说的中朝友谊吗？
    志愿军伤员贾忠明立刻想起在战场上中朝军队并肩作战的具体情景。那是在五次战役中，他们一个班坚守黄草岭阵地，完全被敌人包围了，正在弹尽粮绝难以坚持的时候，突然有一支朝鲜人民游击队，突破了敌人的包围，最后配合他们打退了敌人的进攻。贾忠明兴奋地说：“在回国休养的这些日子里，我每天都想起朝鲜人民军的英勇，想起朝鲜人民对志愿军的支援，想起他们在战争中遭受的痛苦生活。一听到我们要送八万亿元的东西，去帮助朝鲜人民建设，我心里特别愉快。中朝人民血肉相连啊，这太应该了。”
    说到中朝人民血肉相连，志愿军伤员毛德宝又讲述了这样一个动人的故事：
    那是在一九五一年五月十七日的夜晚，志愿军某连崔排长接受了猛袭大水洞敌军据点的任务，当崔排长带领全排越过加里山和七二五高地后，问题发生了：按着地图的标志，此刻已经到了大水洞，但这里什么都没有呀，大水洞到底在哪里呢？正在万分焦急的当儿，忽然从山涧里透出一线灯光。崔排长喜出望外，立时带领一个班直奔灯光而去。
    屋子里的老人一听是中国人民志愿军到了，立刻双手把崔排长拉到屋里，十分激动地说：“中国沙拉米（中国人），顶好！”崔排长让连络员说明来意以后，那老人惊喜异常，就把这儿到大水洞的距离，敌军指挥所和电台的位置，一一告诉了崔排长。可是那老人还不放心，他唯恐扑了空，就亲自领他们去，崔排长所带领的全排战士因此就把大水洞一个团部、一个整营的全部敌军歼灭了。
    谈完这个故事，这位伤员像总结似地说：
  “志愿军在朝鲜作战，要是没有朝鲜人民的热烈支援，就不可能取得胜利。”
  珍惜在中国实
    习的时间
    在国营天津第四棉纺织厂一所漂亮的小楼房里，住着十五个到该厂实习的朝鲜同志，和几个帮助他们学习的中国技术工人和翻译人员。十一月二十四日夜晚，一天的紧张劳动结束了，翻译吴永善把中朝两国的谈判公报、中朝经济及文化合作协定的内容讲给他们听，不同语言的欢呼声，顿时充满了整个房间。朝鲜同志双手拉着中国同志，用不很熟悉的中国话喊叫着：“毛泽东同志允许了，你们都可以到朝鲜，帮助更多的人学习技术，把朝鲜建设得和中国一样美丽！”中国同志们笑着回答：假若可能，我们要和你们一块到朝鲜去帮助你们建设，说不定我们还能一块走入社会主义社会里！
    这十五个朝鲜同志，来自不同的地方和岗位，有工厂里的工人，有农村的妇女，也有出色的游击队员。他们都是光荣的劳动党员，在祖国反侵略的战争中立过功劳，获得过崇高的荣誉。他们在学习技术中，的确碰到很多困难，可是祖国人民的期望督促着，中国同志的热忱耐心的帮助鼓舞着，他们终于逐渐掌握了生产技术了。金福德原是平安北道宁边纺织厂的一个普通女工，在最困难的环境里，她始终完成了自己的生产任务，保证了前线的供应，获得了全国纺织劳动模范的光荣称号。刚来中国学习时，她还不能掌握自动布机操作的技术，于是她白天和大家一块听课，到车间去实习，夜晚就在宿舍里整理笔记、钻研技术和理论。最近一次的实习，她已经能掌握四十台自动布机了。金贞顺是一个二十五岁的朝鲜妇女，出色的女游击队员，曾两次被捕入狱，头部和右腿都受过重伤。操劳过度，头就发晕。可是她仍然和大家一块坚持学习，晚间常常整理笔记到下两点。她说：“我要把中国的先进技术带回祖国，在朝鲜土地上重修起工厂，安装上机器，让我们的人民都有好衣服穿！”
    他们刻苦学习的精神，感动着棉纺四厂的每一个工人。他们以能帮助朝鲜人民学习技术而感到无上光荣。技术工人王洪年、赵淑珍被指定为专任教员。刚开始，没有翻译人员，一九五一织布工作法技术理论又复杂，他们就制出精细的图表，手放在那里，眼看到那里，都画在图表上，直到朝鲜同志明白为止。有时，他们就牺牲自己晚间的文化学习时间，帮助朝鲜同志复习。咸贞女是一个年轻的朝鲜姑娘，没有学习过纺织，赵淑珍和装梭工王美秀就手把手地教她实习。现在，咸贞女已经成了一个能看四十台自动布机的操作能手了。
    再过一个多月，这些朝鲜同志就要回到朝鲜参加自己祖国的恢复和建设事业了。三级国旗勋章获得者李致大说：“我们要珍惜在中国实习的这些时间，更加劲地学习，回国后好好建设我们的祖国！”
    “我们又有机会了”
    在北京大学，中朝两国谈判公报和签订经济及文化合作协定的消息，一清早就从广播上传开了。哲学系辩证唯物教研室的同学蒋继良，今天特别兴奋。还在一九五○年抗美援朝运动刚刚开始，他就报名参军了，可是学校没有批准，而这一直是他未了的心愿。最近，他的弟弟从朝鲜来了信，又勾起了这段心愿。所以，他一听到中朝两国谈判公报的内容，就兴奋地说：“这可又有机会了。”他表示要更加努力学习，将来争取到朝鲜去，像苏联专家帮助我们一样，去帮助朝鲜人民的建设。
    生物系四年级的同学们，这时候，特别怀念起曾经朝夕相处的朝鲜同学们来。朝鲜同学那种虚心，刻苦的学习精神，朝鲜同学对中国同学的那种热情，时时在感动着他们。朝鲜同学孙炳吉回国时他们送别的情景，永远不会忘记。火车要开了，孙炳吉看看即将离别的中国同学，用什么留作纪念呢？最后，他含着泪把他戴的有金日成像的徽章留给了中国同学李扬文。之后，孙炳吉仍不断地给他们写信，孙炳吉在最近一次来信还说：希望他们将来争取到朝鲜去游览美丽的金刚山。现在，他们感到实现他们愿望的可能性更大了。他们决心好好学习，准备随时响应祖国号召去支援朝鲜人民的建设事业。
    北京大学外国留学生中国语言专修班的朝鲜籍同学吴世根听到这个消息后，脸上马上闪出幸福的光芒，他说：“现在，中国政府不但派人去帮助建设我们的祖国，而且还赠给我们食粮、布匹……，我们祖国的建设，不久就可以很快地恢复了，被美国强盗飞机炸伤了的我的小妹妹，不久也可以过幸福的生活了。”朝鲜籍的同学都充满信心地说：为了报答毛主席的爱护，为了完成金日成元帅交给的学习任务，一定要努力学习，将来要把中国人民丰富的文化，介绍给朝鲜人民。
