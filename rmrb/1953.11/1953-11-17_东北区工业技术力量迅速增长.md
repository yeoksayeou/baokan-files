    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The technical strength of factories and enterprises in the Northeast region is growing rapidly. According to statistics from Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian for the first half of 1953, the total number of technical cadres, including engineers, assistant engineers, technicians, and apprentice technicians, cultivated from workers in various factories is 2,062. In the Northeast machinery industry system, skilled workers in various trades such as lathe operators, forgers, milling machine operators, and planers, who were promoted from apprentices, account for 27.7% of the total number of skilled workers. Due to the rapid growth of new technical strength, the ratio of technical personnel to workers in various factories and enterprises has changed significantly. For example, the proportion of technical personnel in the production personnel of factories in the Northeast machinery and electrical industry system has increased from 5% to 8-10% in recent years. Many factories have been able to establish specialized technical institutions to carry out research work on trial production of new products and improvement of product quality.
    The technical talents who have grown up from the workers have rich practical experience and a spirit of hard work. They can seriously study advanced experience in their work and actively exert their creativity. Yang Shunshan, an old technician with more than 30 years of service in the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory, created a copper melting reverberatory furnace after being promoted to engineer, creating more than 1.2 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year. Shen Yuanzhong, the deputy engineer of the factory, who was promoted from a foundry worker, actively studied the operation methods of Soviet foundry workers and designed the foundry workshop into semi-automation, which greatly reduced the heavy physical labor of the foundry workers. Other promoted technicians and skilled workers have also broken through the original level of technicians and skilled workers of the same level. They are not only able to solve specific technical problems, but also able to design, arrange construction procedures, and draw drawings. Liu Yumin, who was promoted from an apprentice to a technician in 1952, has designed 168 sets of large and small fixtures. Because he can accept workers' opinions, repeatedly conduct on-site tests and modifications in his design, most of the products he designed meet the specifications after they are made. At present, the Northeast region is also vigorously running various technical schools, training courses, and spare-time schools to further improve workers' cultural and technical levels and cultivate reserve forces for large-scale economic construction.

    东北区工业技术力量迅速增长
   【新华社沈阳讯】东北区工厂企业的技术力量正在迅速增长。据沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大三市一九五三年上半年的统计，各工厂从工人中培养起来的工程师、助理工程师、技术员、见习技术员等技术干部，总共有二千零六十二人。东北机械工业系统的十七个工厂由学徒提升起来的车工、锻工、铣工、刨工等各工种技术工人，占原有技术工人总数的百分之二十七点七。由于新的技术力量的迅速成长，现在各工厂企业中技术人员和工人的比例已有显著变化。如东北机械和电器工业系统各厂的技术人员在生产人员中所占的比例，几年来已由百分之五增加到百分之八到百分之十。许多工厂已经有可能设立专门的技术机构来进行试制新产品和提高产品质量的研究工作。
    从工人中成长起来的技术人材，具有丰富的实际工作经验和刻苦钻研的精神。他们在工作中能认真学习先进经验，积极发挥创造性。沈阳暖气器材厂一个具有三十多年工龄的老技工杨顺山，在提升为工程师以后，创造了一种熔铜反射鼓风炉，每年给国家创造的财富在十二亿元以上。该厂从翻砂工人提升为副工程师的沈元忠，积极研究苏联翻砂工人的操作方法，把翻砂车间生产设计成为半自动化，大大减轻了翻砂工人笨重的体力劳动。其他被提升起来的技术员和技术工人，也都突破了原来同级技术员和技术工人的水平。他们不但能够解决具体的技术问题，并且能够进行设计、排列施工程序和画制图纸。一九五二年由徒工升为技工的刘玉敏，先后已设计好大、小型卡具一百六十八套。由于他在设计时能接受工人意见，反复地实地试验和修改，因此他设计的产品制成后大部合乎规格要求。目前，东北区还在大力举办各种技术学校、训练班和业余学校，进一步提高工人的文化水平和技术水平，为大规模的经济建设培养后备力量。
