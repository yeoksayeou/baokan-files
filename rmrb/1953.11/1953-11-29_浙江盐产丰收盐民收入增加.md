Zhejiang's salt industry has achieved a bumper harvest, and the income of salt farmers has greatly increased, leading to a preliminary improvement in their living standards. From January to October this year, according to incomplete statistics, the province's salt production has exceeded the annual plan by 3.45%. Among them, the Yuhuan field, despite suffering significant losses from typhoon damage, still increased its output by 72.3% compared to the same period last year. Due to the increase in salt production, the income of salt farmers is also increasing. According to statistics from Andong field alone, from January to August this year, the income of each salt farmer increased by 60% compared to the same period last year. Because of increased income, many salt farmers have been buying cloth to make new clothes, adding to their means of production, and starting to build new houses. In Huxin Village, Xintang Township, seven salt farmer families are building new houses, and more than ten others are planning to do so. In Zhongshan Village, nine salt farmer families have built thirty-seven new houses, and thirteen others have also started building new houses. One salt farmer happily said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in another five years, all the villagers will be able to live in brick houses."

    浙江盐产丰收盐民收入增加
    浙江盐业生产丰收，盐民收入大大增加，生活有了初步改善。全省今年一至十月份，据不完全的统计，产盐数已超过全年计划百分之三点四五，其中玉环场，虽遭遇台风侵袭，损失很大，但产量还比去年同期增加了百分之七十二点三。因为盐产量增加，盐民的收入也在增加着，仅据庵东场的统计，今年一至八月份，每个盐民的收入比去年同期增加了百分之六十。因为收入增加，很多盐民纷纷买布做新衣服，添置生产资料，并开始建筑新住宅。新塘乡胡心村有七家盐民正建造新房屋，还有十多家已在计划中；中山村有九家盐民新造房屋三十七间，还有十三家也在开始建筑新房子了。有一个盐民高兴地说：“在毛主席的领导下，再有五年，村上全部都能住上瓦房了。”　（翟作标）
