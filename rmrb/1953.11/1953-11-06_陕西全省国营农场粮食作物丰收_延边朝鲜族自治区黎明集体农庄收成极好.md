    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: State-run farms in Shaanxi Province have achieved a generally good harvest of grain crops, with a total output reaching 103% of the original increased production plan. The unit area yield is also higher than that of the local farmers who have achieved good harvests. The unit area yield of farms in Suide, Mianxian, Qingjian, Dali and other counties is 20% to 100% higher than that of local farmers. The wheat yield per mu in the Huxian Farm is more than 25% higher than that of the local agricultural producers' cooperatives, more than 56% higher than that of the local mutual aid teams, and more than 71% higher than that of the local individual farmers. The winter wheat trial-planted this year by the farms in the Suide area has a unit area yield that exceeds that of local farmers by two to three times.

    The reason why state-run farms in Shaanxi Province have achieved a good harvest this year is mainly due to the gradual and comprehensive improvement of farming techniques. At the same time, state-run farms in Shaanxi Province have also actively promoted and learned advanced farming techniques from farmers. This year, state-run farms across the province have generally propagated the main local high-quality varieties and systematically supplied them to farmers in need. Most state-run farms use nearby mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives as a base, regularly provide technical guidance, and organize farmers to observe during the agricultural season, teaching them scientific techniques. The Huaxian Farm promoted more than 450 new-style walking plows by organizing on-site experiments and demonstrations of new-style farm implements for nearby farmers. The Anse Farm guided farmers to thin millet and sorghum seedlings, increasing the yield of millet and sorghum in the surrounding seven or eight villages by 20% compared with previous years. The corn planted by the Pingli County Farm suffered from severe drought and lack of seedlings. Later, they learned the local farmers' methods of transplanting seedlings and drought-resistant planting, which basically achieved full seedlings on more than 100 mu of corn, thus achieving a bumper harvest. At the same time, nearby farmers also learned the farm's methods of densely planting rice and corn, which increased this year's yield by 25% compared to last year. The Yichuan County Farm absorbed local farmers to participate in the farm's technical research group, making the farm's techniques such as close planting and strip planting more in line with local actual conditions. This year, the farm's 67 mu of millet and sorghum yielded an average of 400 jin per mu, which was 30% higher than the yield of local farmers, greatly increasing farmers' interest in improving technology.

    The main problems of state-run farms in Shaanxi Province are: high production and management costs, and high grain production costs. At present, the leaders of state-run farms are studying how to strengthen business management, reduce production costs, and continue to increase unit area yield.

    Xinhua News Agency: The Liming Collective Farm in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, has achieved a great harvest this year—the first year after its establishment. This year, the highlands and plains of the farm have had good harvests. The average yield of 87 hectares and 7 mu of paddy and dry land of the farm increased by 20% compared with last year. Among them, except for sorghum and soybeans, which were affected by early frost and maintained last year's good harvest yield, the highest yield of rice was 18,200 jin per hectare, more than double last year's yield. The highest yield of millet per hectare reached 6,500 jin, and the general yield was around 5,500 jin, an increase of one time compared with last year. With the bumper harvest, the remuneration earned by each member of the farm for each workday will increase from 14,000 yuan of the agricultural producers' cooperative last year to more than 20,000 yuan, and the income of the members has increased.

    The Liming Collective Farm was established this spring. The farm has 48 households, 92 members, 87 hectares and 7 mu of cultivated land, a set of horse-drawn farm implements, 23 oxen, and 3 horses. Its predecessor was the agricultural producers' cooperative led by Jin Shilong, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model. They have organized mutual aid teams since 1947 and have a long history of mutual assistance and cooperation.

    The Liming Collective Farm has demonstrated the superiority of collectivization in terms of labor organization and improved farming techniques. The farm formed three field production teams based on the members' specialties, divided the cultivated areas, implemented a year-round contract work and output system, and established a quota system and an excess reward system, which greatly improved the members' enthusiasm for labor and increased labor efficiency. The members actively put forward opinions on improving farming techniques. This year, advanced farming experience was fully adopted in 32 hectares of paddy fields, and close planting was implemented. Guo Houqi's high-yield experience was also promoted in 70% of dry land. In line with the improvement of farming techniques, the amount of fertilizer applied to paddy and dry land has generally increased by one and a half times.

### 陕西全省国营农场粮食作物丰收  延边朝鲜族自治区黎明集体农庄收成极好

    陕西全省国营农场粮食作物丰收
    延边朝鲜族自治区黎明集体农庄收成极好
    【新华社西安讯】陕西省七十四个国营农场的粮食作物普遍丰收，总产量达到原增产计划的百分之一百零三，单位面积产量也都高于获得丰收的当地农民的产量，绥德、沔县、清涧、大荔等县农场的单位面积产量，高出当地农民的百分之二十到一百。鄠县农场的小麦每亩产量高出当地农业生产合作社百分之二十五以上，高出当地互助组百分之五十六以上，高出当地单干农民百分之七十一以上。绥德专区农场今年试种的冬小麦，单位面积产量超过当地农民产量两三倍。
    今年陕西省各国营农场所以获得丰收，主要是由于逐步作到了全面改进耕作技术。同时，陕西省各国营农场还积极向农民推广和学习了先进耕作技术。今年全省各国营农场一般都繁殖了当地主要的优良品种，并有计划地供给农民需要。各国营农场大多以附近互助组或农业生产合作社为基点，经常给予技术指导，并按照农事季节组织农民观摩，向农民传授科学技术。华县农场在组织附近农民进行新式农具的现场试验观摩中，推广了四百五十多张新式步犁。安塞农场指导农民进行糜子、谷子间苗，使周围七八个村子的糜子、谷子的产量比往年提高了百分之二十。平利县农场播种的玉米，由于天旱缺苗很多，后来学习了当地农民移苗和抗旱点种的办法，使一百多亩玉米基本上达到全苗，因而获得丰收；同时，附近农民也因为学习了农场密植水稻、玉米的方法，使今年产量比去年提高了百分之二十五。宜川县农场吸收当地农民参加场内的技术研究小组，使农场所推行的密植、条播等技术更加切合当地的实际情况；今年该场六十七亩糜子、谷子平均每亩收四百斤，高出当地农民产量百分之三十，大大提高了农民对改进技术的兴趣。
    陕西省各国营农场的主要问题是：生产管理费用较高，粮食生产成本较大。目前，各国营农场领导方面正在研究加强经营管理，降低生产成本，继续提高单位面积产量。
    据新华社讯：吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区延吉县黎明集体农庄，今年——建庄后的第一年获得了大丰收。今年农庄的高地和平原都是好年成，全农庄八十七垧（每垧十五市亩）七亩水旱田，平均比去年增产二成；其中除高粱，大豆因受早霜侵害仍保持去年丰收产量外，水稻最高产量每垧有一万八千二百斤，超过了去年产量的一倍以上；谷子每垧最高产量达六千五百斤，一般产量都在五千五百斤左右，较去年增产一倍。在丰收的情况下，农庄庄员每个劳动日所得的报酬将由去年农业生产合作社的一万四千元提高到二万元以上，庄员的收入都增加了。
    黎明集体农庄是今年春天成立的，全庄有四十八户，九十二名庄员，耕地八十七垧七亩，马拉农具一套，耕牛二十三条，马三匹。它的前身是全国著名的农业劳动模范金时龙所领导的农业生产合作社，他们自一九四七年就组织了互助组，已有较久的互助合作基础。
    黎明集体农庄在劳动组织和改进耕作技术方面，都显示了集体化的优越性。农庄根据庄员的特长组成了三个田间生产队，划分耕作区，实行了常年包工包产制，并建立了定额制和超额奖励制度等，大大提高了庄员们的劳动热情，劳动效率也因而提高了。庄员们积极提出改进耕作技术的意见，今年在三十二垧水田内全部采用了先进耕作经验，实行了密植；百分之七十的旱田还推行了郭后旗的丰产经验。在与改进耕作技术相适应的情况下，水旱田的施肥量普遍增加了一倍半。
