    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国技术援助落后国家第四届会议于十一月十二、十三两日在纽约举行。参加会议的有八十多个国家的代表。
    苏联及人民民主国家代表在会上发言支持联合国扩大技术援助落后国家的计划，并代表他们的政府宣布决定捐出款项，作为联合国一九五四年技术援助基金，以帮助落后国家发展经济。苏联及波兰政府曾对一九五三年援助计划捐出过款项。这一次，苏联政府又决定捐款四百万卢布给一九五四年援助计划，乌克兰政府决定捐款五十万卢布，白俄罗斯政府决定捐款二十万卢布，捷克斯洛伐克政府决定捐款五十万克朗。波兰政府也宣布要对一九五四年计划捐出款项。苏联及人民民主国家代表在宣布捐款时，都说明希望这些款项由联合国直接使用，并且只用于各捐款国所给予的技术援助之上。他们指出，这些技术援助应该用来帮助落后国家开发它们的资源，发展工农业，提高人民生活水平。
