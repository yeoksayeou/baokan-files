Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: Under the active support of the United States, West Germany is actively completing various preparations for formally restoring a Nazi "Wehrmacht". Britain is also actively participating in this undertaking of the United States.

Reuters correspondent in Bonn, Harry Gehlberg, revealed information obtained from officials of the Western Allied High Commission in Germany that the United States and Britain are planning to establish military advisors and "liaison groups" in West Germany to "cooperate" with the future West German army. The United States will establish an army attaché and an air force attaché, as well as a military advisory group, in Bonn, and Britain will also establish an army attaché with the same responsibilities in its embassy in Bonn, and perhaps also air force and naval attachés.

Gehlberg said that the United States and Britain have also agreed to help train and equip this new Nazi army in West Germany. The written plans and legislation for establishing this army have already been prepared by the "Blank Office" (Adenauer's actual military department). This "department" concentrates some of the "most resourceful people" of the former Nazi "Wehrmacht". Leading them are former Hitler generals Adolf Heusinger, director of the Operations Department of the Nazi "Wehrmacht" General Staff, and Hans Speidel, former Chief of Staff to Field Marshal Rommel, and others. Gehlberg said that these Nazi generals and their "young" subordinates "are completing the final details of the plan to build the army, and as soon as the politicians give the signal, this new West German army can put on its uniforms."

Gehlberg also said: Some heavy weapons will be shipped from the United States to help train the German army. The United States and Britain have publicly agreed to allow the West German army to use their firing ranges and training grounds in West Germany; West German pilots will practice at American and British bases in Germany; and newly recruited flight students will be sent to the United States and Britain for training.

    在美国和英国的扶持下
    西德加紧恢复纳粹“国防军”
    【新华社十八日讯】在美国的积极扶持下，西德正在积极完成正式恢复一支纳粹“国防军”的各项准备工作。英国也积极参加了美国这一事业。
    路透社驻波恩记者哈利·盖尔柏透露自西方国家驻德高级专员公署的官员处获得的消息说，美国与英国正计划在西德设立军事顾问和“联络组”，以与未来的西德军队进行“合作”。美国将在波恩设立陆军武官与空军武官及一个军事顾问团，英国也将在驻波恩大使馆中设立负有同样职责的陆军武官，或许还将设立空军与海军武官。
    盖尔柏说，美国与英国并同意帮助训练和装备西德这支新纳粹军队，建立这支军队的书面计划和立法已经由“布兰克部”（阿登纳实际上的军部）准备好了。这个“部”集中了前纳粹“国防军”的一些“最有谋略的人”。领导他们的是前希特勒将领、纳粹“国防军”参谋本部作战部主任阿道夫·许辛格与前隆美尔元帅的参谋长汉斯·斯派达尔等人。盖尔柏说，这些纳粹将领及他们的“少壮的”下级们“正在完成建立军队计划的最后细节，只要政客们一发出信号，就可让西德的这支新军队穿起制服来”。
    盖尔柏还说：一部分重武器将从美国运来；帮助训练德国的军队。美国与英国已公开同意了让西德军队使用他们在西德的靶场和练兵场；西德飞行员将在美国与英国在德境的基地上进行练习；新招飞行生将送到美国和英国去受训。
