China National Hardware and Machinery Company, Liaoxi Provincial Company, Storage and Transportation Department
Improving Transportation Methods to Accelerate Commodity Circulation

In response to the call for increased production and conservation, the Storage and Transportation Department of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company, Liaoxi Provincial Company, actively researched and improved cargo transportation methods. In the increased production and conservation competition, the comrades in the Storage and Transportation Department, based on the characteristics of their work, proposed to improve transportation methods, save freight costs, and accelerate commodity circulation. Through examining past work, they discovered that in the past, there were many less-than-carload (LCL) shipments and very few full-carload (FCL) shipments. LCL shipments to Fuxin and Siping alone reached more than 3,000 tons per month, almost entirely LCL. In response to this situation, the comrades in the Storage and Transportation Department calculated the freight rates for LCL and FCL shipments, and found a significant difference. LCL freight rates were 50% to 60% higher than FCL rates. Moreover, LCL shipments involved numerous procedures, wasting a lot of time and slowing down the speed of commodity circulation. Subsequently, they studied how to combine different types of goods into full carloads and began experimenting. The results proved that FCL shipments not only reduced freight costs but also shortened transportation time. For example, goods shipped to Siping took four to five days by LCL, but only two days by FCL. Now, the comrades in the Storage and Transportation Department are further studying how to combine full carloads and increase the load capacity in order to accelerate the speed of commodity circulation and overfulfill the sales plan.

　　中国五金机械公司辽西省公司储运科
    改进运输方法加速商品流转
    中国五金机械公司辽西省公司储运科响应增产节约号召，积极研究，改进了货物的运输方法。在增产节约竞赛中，储运科同志根据本身工作的特点，提出要改进运输方法，节约运费，加速商品流转。他们从检查过去的工作中，发现以前零担发货很多，整车发货很少。仅发往阜新、四平两地的零担货每月即达三千多吨，几乎全是零担发出。针对这种情况，储运科同志计算了零担发货和整车发货的运价，两者相差很大，零担发货的运费比整车发货高出百分之五十至六十。而且，零担发货因为手续繁多，浪费很多时间，延缓了商品流转的速度。接着，他们又研究按商品的种类搭配成整车，开始进行试验。结果证明，整车发货不但降低了运费，并且缩短了运输时间。如发四平的货物，以零担发出需时四五天，整车发出两天即可到达。现在，储运科同志正进一步研究如何搭配整车、提高载量的办法，以求得加快商品流转速度，超额完成推销计划。
