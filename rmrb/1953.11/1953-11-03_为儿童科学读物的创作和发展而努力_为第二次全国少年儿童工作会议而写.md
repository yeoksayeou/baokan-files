    Fresh life needs rich nourishment. Children need various kinds of knowledge, especially scientific knowledge.

    The editors of the China Youth Daily told me that they often receive letters from young readers asking them to answer questions about science. These letters have now piled up, and the "Brain Teaser Doctor Mailbox" cannot hold them all. Some have been forwarded to the China Youth Publishing House.

    Recently, many Young Pioneer members have visited me and written to me, reporting on their studies and expressing their wishes for learning. Many children are willing to learn science; they ask me about methods of learning science and ask me to recommend some good popular science reading materials.

    Both of these facts show that our children have a high enthusiasm for scientific knowledge and a very urgent need for science reading materials.

    Generally speaking, at present in our country, there are few good children's literary works and many bad ones; for children's science reading materials, there are even fewer good ones, and not many bad ones either.

    In the ocean of books, how many children's science reading materials can you find? I also looked for a long time. What I found, excluding translations, are only seven books such as "Forest Stories" published by the Shanghai Children's Publishing House; eight books such as "Underground Palace" published by the Commercial Press; and seven books such as "The Adventures of the Germ World" published by the China Youth Publishing House, totaling more than twenty books. It's really too few.

    Why is there so little?

    Is it that our scientists are not concerned enough about children's cause? Yes.

    The number of Chinese scientific workers is already small, and even fewer are interested in writing. They are accustomed to writing experimental reports and papers, which are very distant from children. Most of them are absorbed in their own research work, not thinking that children are the successors to their research work tomorrow, not thinking that old scientists are cultivated from young scientists, and young scientists are cultivated from children. Scientific research is a collective undertaking. Children are a very important part of the collective. If we value the collective undertaking, we should care about children.

    Under such circumstances, it is difficult to ask scientists to write children's science reading materials. Ilin also told us in "Talking about Science": "Whoever talks about asking scientists to write some literary popular science works is sure to encounter a rebuttal: 'Scientists don't have time to write, they are all busy people.'"

    Ilin also said:

    "But Fersman (a Soviet mineralogist, a famous geochemist) was also a busy man, and Vavilov (the former president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences) was also extremely busy, yet they still squeezed out time to talk about science with the people and children.

    "Of course, if the problem is not handled from a practical point of view, and the important tasks are not given to scientists and writers, and a grand prospect is not opened up in front of them, then the ranks of authors who write literary and scientific works will certainly grow very slowly."

    Is it that the scientific leadership organs do not pay enough attention to children's science?

    In the literary army, the Writers Association already has a children's literature creation group, leading writers to carry out children's literature creation activities. In the scientific army, we also hope that the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Association for Science and Technology, and the All-China Association for Science Popularization can gradually establish organizations such as children's science committees, children's science palaces, and children's science stations to gradually guide children into the door of science.

    I think the creation of children's science reading materials should be hosted by the All-China Association for Science Popularization. Children's science reading materials, like children's literary reading materials, are not only an excellent tool for assisting children's education, but also can educate adults. Works specifically aimed at workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot be completely applied to children, but if works are aimed at children, workers, peasants, and soldiers often like to read them as well.

    Are writers not working hard enough to write children's science reading materials? Yes.

    Ilin once pointed out in "Talking about Science":

      "Writers of the communist era are comprehensively developed, complete people. For them, knowledge and creativity are inseparable.

      "The literature of the future is literature fully armed with science."

    Although we have not yet reached a communist society, we are also moving in this direction.

    Millions of children are eager for writers to write new and good works like Ilin's "The Story of the Five-Year Plan" and "One Hundred Thousand Whys." Can we let them down?

    Our writers must not regard the writing of children's science reading materials as a not very important thing. This is related to the future of the motherland. Aren't today's children the builders and defenders of the motherland tomorrow? Aren't they the transformers of nature? Aren't they labor heroes in socialist industrialization? Tens of millions of children will go to factories, mines, farms, railways, aviation, water conservancy projects, geological exploration teams, and various laboratories.

    Now our country has entered a new historical period of large-scale planned construction. The first five-year plan is placed before us, socialist industrialization is our path, and construction requires science. On the road to socialist industrialization, we not only need a strong scientific team, but also more reserves. Children are the reserves for our country's construction. Don't think that the five-year plan is entirely the work of adults. Every child can be a builder of the "five-year plan."

    Ilin said it well: "Adults set up large power plants, and children can set up small ones; adults build large houses, and children can build birdhouses and bird feeders.

    "Don't think these are small things.

    "If the children complete their 'five-year plan', they will recover grain worth 400,000 pounds from pests.

      "If the children add two laying hens to each household, they can offer the country five trillion eggs, worth 20 million pounds.

      "Millions of foreign money are made up of copper plates; soft hands, if they are very numerous, can move mountains, plant trees into forests.

    "The power of children exists here." (Ilin: The Story of the Five-Year Plan)

    Are publishers not paying enough attention to the publication of children's science reading materials? Yes.

    Some publishers are working very hard to publish natural science textbooks, but they are not paying enough attention to the publication of children's science reading materials, so that the originally planned series of juvenile science books cannot be realized on schedule. This is because they do not have a sufficient understanding and evaluation of their tasks and lack confidence.

    Comrade Zhang Tianyi hopes that various publishing houses can train some literary editors to rewrite some literary works and scientific knowledge articles suitable for children's reading, because children will have difficulty accepting this type of work if it is not properly rewritten. This is a good idea, and it is the beginning of cooperation between literature and science.

    Children all hope that scientists, writers, and teachers will take some time out of their busy schedules to write more things for them that are not boring and monotonous, not reference books or textbook-style narratives, nor simply starting from fun, but popular science works that are of educational significance to their young lives and have guiding significance for their scientific production activities.

    We hope that scientists and writers can well combine scientific knowledge with children's thoughts and feelings in their descriptions, vividly linking the development prospects of science and technology with the happy life of mankind and the great ideals of communism, just like what Ilin wrote.

    Writing to this point, I looked at the five lovely red scarves hanging in my room, all of which were given to me by Young Pioneer members. They constantly visit me and write letters to comfort me. How can I not feel ashamed, how can I not think about how little I have done for them! My past efforts are not enough. Although I have been bound to a chair by illness for nearly twenty years, all actions require help, and speaking is inconvenient. Under such circumstances, how many good books can I write? I wish I could cure my illness sooner and make more contributions to the new generation of the motherland.

    I hope that the scientific community will pay more attention to this cause. I hope that scientists and writers can work together to write more and better popular science reading materials for children. Publishers should formulate publication plans for children's science reading materials and vigorously guarantee their completion. Primary school teachers, counselors, and children's workers should contact scientists and writers more often and regularly report the situation of children to them in order to encourage them to write for children.

    为儿童科学读物的创作和发展而努力
    ——为第二次全国少年儿童工作会议而写
    中华全国科学技术普及协会  全国委员会委员  高士其
    新鲜的生命，是需要丰富的滋养的。少年儿童需要各种知识的滋养，尤其是科学知识的滋养。
    中国少年报的编者告诉我，他们经常地收到少年读者的来信，请他们解答有关科学方面的问题，这些信件现在已经积成一大堆，“动脑筋博士信箱”容纳不下，有一部分已转到中国青年出版社去了。
    近来有好些少年先锋队队员来访问我，写信给我，报告他们学习的情况，并且提出自己对于学习的愿望。有许多小朋友都愿意学习科学；他们问我学习科学的方法，并且要求我给他们介绍几本好的通俗的科学读物。
    这两件事实都说明了我们的少年儿童对于科学知识的热情是很高的，对于科学读物的要求是非常迫切的。
    一般说来，现在在我们国内，儿童文艺读物好的少，不好的多；儿童科学读物呢，好的更少，不好的也不多。
    在书店的海洋中，你能找出几本儿童科学读物呢？我也找了好久，我所发现的，除了翻译本不算在内，仅有上海少年儿童出版社所出版的“森林的故事”等七本；商务印书馆所出版的“地下的宫殿”等八本以及中国青年出版社所出版的“细菌世界探险记”等七本，共计有二十多本。真是少得太可怜了。
    其所以这样少，原因在那里呢？
    是我们的科学家对儿童的事业不够关心吗？是的。
    中国科学工作者的人数，本来就很少，对于写作感兴趣的尤其少，他们习惯于写实验报告和论文，这些著作和儿童的距离是很远的。他们大多数都热中于自己的研究工作，没有想到儿童就是他们明天研究工作的接替者，没有想到老科学家是从青年科学家培养起来的，青年科学家又是从少年儿童里培养起来的。科学研究是集体事业。儿童是集体里面很重要的一部分，我们重视集体事业就应该关心儿童。
    在这种情形之下，请科学家写儿童科学读物是有困难的。伊林在“谈谈科学”里也曾告诉我们：“谁要是谈起叫科学家写点文艺性的普及知识的作品，那准会碰到一个反驳：‘科学家没有功夫写，他们都是忙人’。”
    伊林又说：
    “可是费尔斯曼（苏联的矿物学家，著名的地质化学家）也是忙人，瓦维洛夫（前任苏联科学院院长）也忙得要命，他们尚且挤出功夫来和人民大众和儿童谈谈科学。
    “当然，如果处理问题不从实际出发，不把重大的任务交给科学家和作家，不在他们面前打开宏大的远景，那么，写作文艺性的科学作品的作者的队伍，一定会成长得很慢。”
    是科学领导机关对于儿童科学不重视吗？
    在文艺大军里，作家协会已有儿童文学创作组的组织，领导作家们进行儿童文学的创作活动。在科学大军里，我们也希望中国科学院、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会能逐渐成立儿童科学委员会、儿童科学宫和儿童科学站等的组织，把儿童逐步引导到科学的大门里去。
    我看儿童科学读物创作应该由中华全国科学技术普及协会来主持。儿童科学读物也和儿童文艺读物一样，不仅是辅助儿童教育的绝好工具，而且可以教育成年人。专门以工农兵为对象的作品不能完全适用于儿童，但如以儿童为对象的作品，则工农兵往往也喜欢看。
    是作家们对于儿童科学读物的写作不够努力吗？是的。
    伊林在“谈谈科学”里曾经指出：
      “共产主义时代的作家是全面发展的、完整的人，对于他们来说，知识和创造性是分不开的。
      “将来的文学是用科学来全副武装的文学。”
    我们虽然还没有到达共产主义社会，但是我们也是朝着这个方向走的。
    我们面前有千百万少年儿童都在渴望着作家们给他们写出新的好的像伊林的“五年计划故事”、“十万个为什么”一类的作品，我们能让他们失望吗？
    我们的作家，不能把儿童科学读物的写作看作不十分重要的事情，这关系着祖国的未来。今天的少年儿童，不就是明天祖国的建设者和保卫者吗？不就是大自然的改造者吗？不就是社会主义工业化中的劳动英雄吗？几千万的少年儿童就要走到工厂、矿山、农场、铁路、航空、水利工程、地质勘查队以及各个试验室里去。
    现在我们国家已经进入大规模的有计划建设的新的历史时期，第一个五年计划摆在我们的面前，社会主义工业化是我们的道路，要建设就需要有科学。在社会主义工业化的途中，我们不但需要有强大的科学队伍，还需要有更多的后备军，少年儿童就是我们国家建设的后备军。不要以为五年计划完全是大人的工作，每一个孩子都可以作“五年计划”的建设者。
    伊林说得好：“大人创办大的发电厂，小孩子可以创办小的；大人建造大的房屋，小孩子可以建造掠鸟舍、鸟食台。
    “不要以为这些是小事。
    “如果小孩子们完成了他们的‘五年计划’，他们就从害虫那儿挽回价值四十万金镑的谷物。
      “如果小孩子给每家增加两只会生蛋的母鸡，他们就可以献给国家五兆鸡蛋，价值二千万金镑。
      “百万的洋钱，是由铜板积成的；柔软的手，如果是非常之多，可以移动山脉，栽种树木成森林。
    “小孩子的力量就存在这里面。”（伊林：五年计划故事）
    是出版家对于儿童科学读物的出版工作不够注意吗？是的。
    有些出版家对于自然科学教科书的出版是很努力的，但对于儿童科学读物的出版是不够注意的，以至于原来规定的少年科学丛书出版计划不能按期实现，这是因为对于自己的任务认识不足、估价不够而又缺少信心。
    张天翼同志希望各出版社能培养一些文学编辑，改写一些适合儿童阅读的文学作品和科学知识文章，因为这一类作品，如果不经过适当的改写，孩子们是很难接受的。这是很好的意见，这是文学和科学合作的一个开端。
    少年儿童们都希望科学家、作家和教师们在他们百忙中抽出一部分时间，为他们多写些不是枯燥无味千篇一律的东西，不是参考书或教科书式的叙述，也不是单纯的从趣味出发，而是对于他们年青的生活有教育意义和对于他们的科学生产活动具有指导性的通俗科学作品。
    我们希望：科学家、作家能很好地把科学知识结合儿童的思想感情来描写，生动地把科学技术的发展前途和人类幸福的生活、共产主义的伟大理想联系在一起，像伊林所写的那样。
    写到这里，我望着我房间里所挂的五条可爱的红领巾，这些红领巾都是少年先锋队队员们赠送给我的。他们不断地来访问我，并且写信来慰问我，我怎能不觉得惭愧，怎能不想想我为他们作的太少了！我过去的努力是不够的，虽然我是被病魔捆缚在椅子上将近二十年，一切动作都需要人帮助，说话也不方便，在这样情形之下，我能写出几本好书呢？我恨不得把病早些医好，为祖国新生的一代做出更多的贡献。
    我希望科学界多注意这种事业，我希望科学家们、作家们，能共同努力为儿童写出更多更好的科学通俗读物。出版家们订出儿童科学读物的出版计划，并且大力保证其完成。小学教师们、辅导员和少年儿童工作者们、和科学家、作家们多联系，经常地把少年儿童的情况报告给他们，以鼓舞他们来为儿童写作。
