It was a clear day.

The comrades of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, after participating in the restoration project of the famous "Dragon-Seeing Water Storage Pond" in Korea, rushed here to build a highway. Today, the comrades worked with unprecedented enthusiasm. Sometimes, when they looked up to wipe their sweat, they would invariably shield their eyes from the dazzling sunlight and gaze at the small road in the distance.

Last night, the division headquarters called and said that nine guests from afar would be visiting everyone today. The comrades of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company were so excited that some of them couldn't sleep well last night. Indeed, how could the soldiers forget the old folks of Gao Village, Liu Jingli, Yinshan County, with whom they had shared weal and woe! They could never forget the night they left Gao Village, when the old folks, supporting the old and leading the young, watched them with tearful eyes, unable to express their feelings of parting in a thousand words! The soldiers shook the hands of the old folks and said, "Let's meet again after the victory. We will never forget you." The people of Gao Village saw them off for a long way, and even after the troops had gone far, they were still shouting behind them: "Dear ones! Be sure to send a message after winning the battle."

Now, it is these old folks who have sent representatives from Gao Village, two hundred miles away, to visit them. The past, like smoke, swirls in the hearts of every soldier.

A year ago, since the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army settled in Gao Village, they had forged a deep friendship with the local folks. In the spring, the soldiers helped the people of Gao Village cut grass and apply manure; in the summer, they hoed the fields for them. No matter how busy they were, they would find time to bundle firewood and carry water for the old folks. The soldiers never accepted any gifts from the old folks. The people of Gao Village would always secretly put vegetables in the soldiers' kitchen pots or quietly take the soldiers' clothes off, wash them, and send them back.

Sometimes, by the roadside or under the trees, one could often see the soldiers and the old folks learning each other's languages. After a long time, they could squat together and chat with gestures. A language mixed with Chinese and Korean words spread in this village.

However, since the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company were ordered to go to the front line and leave Gao Village, the village seemed exceptionally deserted, and the old folks felt unaccustomed to it. Whether they went up the mountain or down to the fields, they always thought of the Volunteer Army. When people got together, they always loved to talk about the good deeds of the Volunteer Army. Which position are these young men on now? Do they have vegetables to eat? Who has made great contributions? …

Not long after the separation, the people of Gao Village began to receive letters from the soldiers of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company from the front line. Every time the people of Gao Village received a letter from the Volunteer Army, the men, women, and children of the whole village were as excited as if they had received a treasure. Illiterate old women went everywhere to find someone to read the letter to them. After listening, they still held the letter and were reluctant to put it down. In addition to reporting their victory, the soldiers also sincerely expressed their infinite nostalgia for the people of Gao Village in their letters. When the comrades were digging tunnels, when the battle was in progress, the soldiers said: Thinking of the people of Gao Village, they have energy to do anything. This sincere emotion also brought boundless encouragement to the people of Gao Village. In order to support the Volunteer Army with practical actions, although they lacked the help of the Volunteer Army this year, because of their good organization, this year's autumn seedlings grew more sturdily than in previous years, and the people of the whole village were full of confidence in welcoming the first harvest after the victory.

When the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement reached Gao Village, the people of Gao Village thought of the comrades of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company again. How wonderful it would be to see them again! It was a pleasant surprise! Soon, they did receive letters from these soldiers from a certain place two hundred miles away. The people of Gao Village were extremely excited. The people of the whole village decided to send representatives to visit their loved ones whom they missed all the time.

Sixty-three-year-old Jin Baogen, fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer member Sun Changde, and seven elderly women, carrying three exquisite flags embroidered with "Model of Love for the People," two chickens, a large bottle of wine, and many apples, happily left Gao Village as if they were visiting their own children.

However, good things are often thwarted. They encountered heavy rain on the way, the river flooded, and the bridge was washed away. They had to return to Gao Village with disappointment. Old man Jin Baogen also fell ill from the rain. Everyone in the village advised him to stay, but the old man shook his head repeatedly and said: "I must go, no one can stop me."

After the weather cleared, the nine people started their journey again. Although these elderly people gasped for breath with every step, none of them were willing to be left behind. Fourteen-year-old Sun Changde carried a large wine bottle on his back and occasionally took out a few grains of corn from his pocket and stuffed them into the chicken's beak. He thought: I can't let the chickens get thin on the road, I must give Uncle Volunteer Army two big, fat chickens.

The arduous journey of two hundred miles was finally overcome by them.

When the nine representatives of Gao Village were discovered by the soldiers of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company who were building the road, the comrades swarmed up. The soldiers shouted "Amani," "Aba Ji" non-stop, as if they had seen their parents whom they had been separated from for a long time. The old women had tears in their eyes, touched this soldier, patted that soldier, and kept calling out everyone's name, saying repeatedly: "Thanks to you!" Fourteen-year-old Sun Changde jumped into the arms of a Volunteer Army soldier and refused to come down. As soon as old man Jin Baogen saw the soldiers, he seemed to be satisfied. At this time, his body could no longer support him. He sat weakly on the ground and coughed non-stop, while excitedly staring at the soldiers and said: "Good children, I finally see you again. I don't want anything else, I just hope you practice your skills well. Now the American devils have not withdrawn from Korea, you must be very careful!"

The Volunteer Army soldiers and these Korean old folks who had come from afar to visit them were completely immersed in the joy of reunion after a long separation. At this time, the surroundings were quiet, and there were occasional pleasant bird calls and insect chirps. On the other side of the road, one could clearly see people in red and green walking. The branches and leaves of the apple trees fluttered in the breeze under the warm sunshine. Everything evoked the thoughts of the comrades of the Eighth Company and the Machine Gun Company and the nine Korean old folks. When they separated last time, where in Korea would there have been such a scene? At that time, there was smoke and fire everywhere, the howls of enemy planes and the whine of bombs. Now, the soldiers and the old folks looked at this peaceful scene and looked at each other, and could not help but smile knowingly. This smile showed their love for peace and the deep friendship forged with blood by the Chinese and Korean people in the battle.

    深厚的友谊
    萧琦
    这是一个晴朗的天气。
    志愿军某部八连和机枪连的同志们，在参加了朝鲜著名的“见龙贮水池”修复工程后，又赶到这里来修筑公路。今天，同志们怀着往常所没有的心情，工作得特别起劲儿。有时，当他们抬起头来擦汗的时候，总是不约而同地用手遮住耀眼的阳光，向远处的小路上张望。
    昨晚师部来电话说，今天将有九个远道客人来探望大家。八连与机枪连的同志们知道以后，有的兴奋得夜里都没睡好觉。是的，战士们怎么能够忘掉了患难相处的殷山郡柳井里高村的老乡们呢！他们什么时候也忘不了离开高村的那天晚上，老乡们扶老携幼，眼泪汪汪地望着他们，千言万语都说不尽这种离别之情啊！战士们握着老乡的手说：“胜利后再见吧，我们永远忘不了你们。”高村人民送了一程又一程，直到部队走远了，还在背后喊：“亲人呀！打了胜仗可千万捎个信来。”
    现在，正是这些老乡们，又从二百里外的高村，派代表来看他们了。往事像云烟一样，又缭绕在每个战士的心头。
    一年前，自从志愿军某部八连和机枪连住在高村后，他们就和这里的老乡结下了深厚的友情。战士们在春天帮助高村人民割草上粪，夏天给他们锄地，再忙也抽时间给老乡捆柴、担水。碰到青黄不接的时候，就节省下粮食，救济这些苦难人民。战士们从来不肯接受老乡们的一点馈赠，高村人民总是偷偷地把青菜放在战士们伙房的锅里，或悄悄地把战士脱下来的衣服取去，洗了后再送回来。
    有时候，在路边或树下，常常看到战士们和老乡们互相学习着对方的语言，日子久了，他们就可以蹲在一块比划着用手势谈家常了。一种夹杂着中朝字句的话语，就在这个村子里流传开来。
    但是，自从八连和机枪连奉命开赴前线、离开高村后，村子里显得异常冷清起来，老乡们感到不习惯了。他们上山也好，下地也好，总是惦念着志愿军。人们凑在一起，总爱谈起志愿军的好处来，这些小伙子现在在哪个阵地上呢？他们有没有青菜吃呀？谁又立了大功？……
    分别以后不久，高村人民开始接到八连和机枪连的战士们从前线寄来的信。高村人民每接到志愿军的一封信，全村男女老少都兴奋得像得到一件宝贝一样，不识字的老太太，到处找人给她念信听，听完了，还捏着信舍不得放下。战士们除了报告他们胜利的消息外，还在信上朴实地流露出对高村人民的无限怀念。当同志们在挖坑道的时候，当战斗正在行进的时候，战士们说：想起了高村人民，干什么都有劲儿。这种真挚的感情，同样地也给高村人民带来无限的鼓舞。高村人民为了用实际行动支援志愿军，他们今年虽然缺乏志愿军帮工，可是由于他们组织的好，今年秋苗比往年生得更茁实，全村人民已满有把握地在欢迎这个胜利后的第一次丰收了。
    当朝鲜停战协定签字的消息传到高村后，高村人民又想起八连和机枪连的同志们了。要是能够再见一面该是多么好呵！真是喜出望外啊！不久，他们果然接到这些战士们从二百里外的某地寄来的信。高村人民兴奋极了。全村人民决定派选代表，去探望他们时时刻刻怀念的亲人。
    六十三岁的金宝根、十四岁的少年团团员孙昌德和七个上了年纪的老太太，带着三面精致的绣着
  “爱民模范”的旗子、两只鸡、一大瓶酒和许多苹果，像看望自己亲生的儿女一样，欢欢喜喜地离开了高村。
    但是，好事多魔，中途又遇到了大雨，河水泛滥，桥梁也被冲断了，他们不得不带着失望的心情，再返回高村。金宝根老大爷也被雨淋病了，全村人都劝他留下来，老头子连连摇头说：“我一定还要去，谁也阻止不了我。”
    天晴后，九个人又开始了行程。这些老年人，虽然一步一喘，谁也不肯拉在后面。十四岁的孙昌德背着一个大酒瓶，不时地从衣袋里取出几粒包米，填到鸡嘴里，他想：在路上也不能让鸡饿瘦了，一定要送给志愿军叔叔两只大肥鸡。
    二百里艰苦的路程，终于被他们战胜了。
    当高村的九个代表被正在筑路的八连和机枪连的战士们发现了的时候，同志们一窝蜂地拥了上去。战士们像看到了久别的爹娘，“阿妈尼”、“阿爸吉”地喊个不停。老大娘们眼里含着泪花，摸摸这个战士，又拍拍那个战士，不断地喊着每个人的名字，连声地说：“多亏了你们呀！”十四岁的孙昌德一下就扑在一个志愿军战士的怀里，再也不肯下来。金宝根老大爷一看见战士们，好像已经心满意足了，这时他的身体再也支持不住了，他一面无力地坐在地下咳个不停，一面兴奋地盯着战士们说：“好孩子，终于又看到你们了，我别的不想，就盼望你们练好本领，现在美国鬼子还没从朝鲜撤出去，你们一定要多多提防啊！”
    志愿军战士和远道来看望他们的这些朝鲜老乡们完全沉浸在别后复聚的欢乐中。这时，周围一片宁静，不时传来愉快地鸟叫虫鸣，公路那边，可以清楚地看到正在行走着的穿红着绿的人们，苹果树的枝叶在和煦的阳光下迎风飘荡，一切的一切，都格外引起八连和机枪连的同志们以及九位朝鲜老乡们的思念。当他们上次分离的时候，在朝鲜哪里会有这等景象，那时到处是烟是火，是敌机的嚎叫和炸弹的啸音。现在，战士们和老乡们看着这种和平的景象，又互相看看，不禁发出会心的微笑。这微笑显示着他们对和平的热爱，显示着中朝人民在战斗中用鲜血凝结成的深厚友谊。
