Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 7th: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued a communique on the 7th, stating that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission rejected the shameless request made by the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang to allow them to distribute "gifts" to prisoners of war in the southern prisoner of war camp within the custodial zone. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission replied to Hamblen, the head of the so-called "Repatriation Group" of the United Nations Command, stating that the commission could not "consider the requested gifts to be without any political content." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stated that it found it difficult to agree with the statement made by Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs and secret service chief of the Kuomintang, who claimed that canned pork and other items had "nothing to do with politics or ideology."

Recently repatriated personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army revealed that Kuomintang secret agents within the custodial zone had promised each prisoner of war that if they killed a Chinese interpretation representative or a representative from Poland or Czechoslovakia in the explanation tent, they would be rewarded with four cans of meat.

After the signing of the armistice agreement, disregarding the protests lodged by the Korean and Chinese sides with the Military Armistice Commission, the U.S. military authorities, in violation of the armistice agreement, allowed a so-called "comfort mission" led by Kuomintang secret service chief Fang Zhi to go to Jeju Island to instruct secret agents in the prisoner of war camps to sabotage the explanation work and threaten prisoners of war, demanding that they refuse repatriation. Fang Zhi had distributed shirts printed with the Kuomintang party emblem to prisoners of war on Jeju Island and forced them to wear them when they were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

Hamblen's public request to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to allow Taiwan Kuomintang secret agents to send so-called "gifts" to prisoners of war is further evidence of the collusion between the United States and Kuomintang secret agents planted in the custodial camps to coerce prisoners of war to refuse repatriation. Evidence of the collaboration between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang can also be found in the explanation tents. Before the start of the explanation work, Kuomintang secret agents had undergone training in South Korea to sabotage the explanation work. They were then sent to the explanation tents to act as so-called "representatives of the detaining side" or interpreters to disrupt the explanation work and threaten prisoners of war.

    中立国遣返委员会答复汉布伦
    拒绝蒋匪向战俘散发“慰问品”的无耻要求
    【新华社开城七日电】中立国遣返委员会七日发表公报说，中立国遣返委员会拒绝了台湾国民党匪帮提出的允许他们向看管区南部战俘营的战俘散发“慰问品”的无耻要求。中立国遣返委员会回答联合国军司令部所谓“遣返组”组长汉布伦说，委员会不能“认为要求散发的礼物是全无政治内容的”。中立国遣返委员会说，该委员会碍难同意国民党社会部部长、特务头子谷正纲的说法。谷正纲认为罐头猪肉和其他物品“与政治或思想毫无关系”。
    最近遣返回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员揭露说，看管区内的国民党特务曾答应每个战俘：如果他们在解释帐篷里打死一名中国解释代表或一名波兰或捷克斯洛伐克的代表，就奖给四听肉罐头。
    在停战协定签字以后，不顾朝中方面向军事停战委员会提出的抗议，美国军事当局违反停战协定，允许国民党特务头子方治率领的所谓“慰问团”到济州岛上去指示战俘营中的特务分子破坏解释工作，并且威胁战俘，要他们拒绝遣返。方治曾在济州岛向战俘散发印着国民党党徽的衬衣，并强迫他们在被移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的时候穿上。
    汉布伦向中立国遣返委员会公开要求允许台湾国民党特务送所谓“礼物”给战俘，就是美国与安插在看管营中的国民党特务暗中勾结、胁迫战俘拒绝遣返的又一明证。美国和蒋介石匪帮合作的证据也可以在解释帐篷中找到。在解释工作开始之前，国民党特务就在南朝鲜受过破坏解释工作的训练。然后他们被派到解释帐篷中充当所谓“拘留一方的代表”或译员，来破坏解释工作和威胁战俘。
