    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Sends a Large Number of Employees to Universities and Colleges Across the Country for Study
    In order to adapt to the needs of the country's planned economic construction and cultivate a large number of medium and high-level technical personnel from the working class, Anshan Iron and Steel Company formulated a cadre training plan this spring. Starting in April this year, it systematically selected more than 400 outstanding young workers, staff members, and technicians from various factories and mines and sent them to universities and colleges across the country for study. The vast majority of them entered the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Middle Schools attached to Harbin Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, etc.; a portion went to study at Renmin University of China, Anshan Second Industrial Technical School, etc. More than 95 percent of the enrolled students are workers, and after several years of spare-time study, they all have a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate.

    鞍钢选送大批职工到各地大中学校学习
    鞍山钢铁公司为了适应国家有计划的经济建设的需要，培养大批工人出身的中高级技术人材，在今年春天订出了干部培养训练计划。今年四月开始，从各厂矿中有计划地挑选了四百多名优秀的青年工人、职员和技术人员，送到各地大中学校学习。其中绝大部分都进入哈尔滨工业大学、东北工学院、大连工学院等校附设的工农速成中学学习；一部分到中国人民大学、鞍山第二工业技术学校等校学习。入学的学员中，百分之九十五以上是工人，他们经过几年的业余学习，都具有高小程度的文化水平。
