What Does the Zhang Zilong Tragedy Illustrate?
By our reporter Hu Jin

The incident of Zhang Zilong being murdered by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents for insisting on repatriation is still under investigation by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) with testimony from our side's personnel. NNRC Chairman Thimayya stated on the 4th that "sufficient evidence has been obtained." However, the activities of American-directed secret agents to sabotage the explanation work have intensified, causing the explanation work to be interrupted for six consecutive days and plunging it into a serious and dangerous phase. This clearly proves that the key issues in the current explanation work, as revealed by the Zhang Zilong incident, deserve the attention of the NNRC.

Complete and Thorough Forcible Detention of Prisoners of War

Zhang Zilong's long-term persecution after being captured and his eventual brutal murder comprehensively reflect the inhumane treatment, violating human dignity and international regulations, suffered by our captured personnel. It also starkly exposes the American side's complete and thorough crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

Since his capture in May 1951, from the American prisoner-of-war camps in Busan and Jeju Island to the prisoner-of-war camp under the supervision of the NNRC, Zhang Zilong consistently insisted on repatriation, and therefore suffered endless torment and persecution.

In April 1952, after the American side's lies about so-called "voluntary repatriation" at the armistice negotiation table were exposed by successive struggles of our captured personnel, they began to play a trick called "fair screening" to implement new threats and persecution against our captured personnel who demanded repatriation. However, the struggle of our captured personnel became even more intense, and the Dodd incident was a powerful proof. After the "screening," the American side forcibly divided our captured personnel into two categories: those who firmly demanded repatriation and those who allegedly "refused repatriation," and segregated them for custody. The prisoner-of-war camps where the former were concentrated were called "Repatriation Prisoner-of-War Camps" by our captured personnel. Our captured personnel, who were allegedly "refusing repatriation" by the American side, continued to struggle to be sent to the "Repatriation Prisoner-of-War Camps."

Zhang Zilong was such a prisoner of war. During the "screening" in the American prisoner-of-war camp in Busan, he bravely demanded repatriation, and to show his determination, he refused to eat the food issued by the American side, preferring to endure hunger and eat grass roots. However, the American side sent him back to the hands of the Chiang bandit secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camp that was allegedly "refusing repatriation." In July 1952, Zhang Zilong was transferred to the Moksopo prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island. Not long after arriving there, Zhang Zilong climbed over the barbed wire three times, attempting to escape to the "Repatriation Prisoner-of-War Camp," but was caught by the American army and returned to the original camp. Since then, Zhang Zilong was frequently subjected to brutal torture. At the same time, the American side, through secret agents, intensified the persecution of all our captured personnel, especially those who allegedly "refused repatriation." The "Movement to Investigate Returning Elements" in March and April 1953 was a crime of large-scale and brutal persecution. Zhang Zilong was almost beaten to death with clubs in this "movement."

After the armistice, Zhang Zilong, who firmly demanded repatriation, was not directly repatriated but was listed as a "non-directly repatriated" prisoner of war and sent to Camp 28 in Dongjang-ri, continuing to be under the unaltered control of the Chiang bandit secret agents. Because Zhang Zilong still insisted on going home, the American-Chiang secret agents murdered him.

This blood debt clearly shows that whether during the period of direct detention by the American side or during the period of supervision by the NNRC, the persecution and even the brutal murder suffered by Zhang Zilong were due to the American side's consistent bloody hands of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The secret of the American side's sabotage of the explanation work lies here.

Which Side is Humanitarianism Really On?

The American side has many vicious means to instigate Chiang-Li secret agents to persecute prisoners of war and prevent them from returning home. In addition to forcing prisoners of war to listen to reactionary lessons, deceiving and enticing them, and using forced tattooing, writing blood letters, joining reactionary organizations, and other vile and degenerate methods to destroy the personality, dignity, and morality of prisoners of war, they also implement a terrorist and violent rule over prisoners of war, pushing them to the brink of death.

Zhang Zilong himself suffered all kinds of persecution suffered by our captured personnel, and was endlessly persecuted every moment. He was punished with imprisonment, hard labor, two days without food, without sleep, slapping, kicking, kneeling... These were considered daily minor incidents. He was beaten repeatedly, and being beaten with several large sticks was considered a light punishment. After he was "investigated" in the "Movement to Investigate Returning Elements," he was brutally beaten with more than two hundred sticks and fainted twice. An hour later, when he woke up, he was forced to hold a bucket filled with five gallons of water in both hands, with his feet half-bent and his heels raised, standing on a piece of wood.

After arriving at the Dongjang-ri camp, on September 18, because Zhang Zilong refused to shout reactionary slogans, he was punished for two consecutive days by placing a bowl of water on his head, staring directly at the sun, and holding a basin filled with water with both hands for more than two hours. Whenever his hands weakened, his eyes became dizzy, and the water spilled, he was beaten with a stick. From then on, the secret agents forced him every day to ask "Where are you going back to?" Every time Zhang Zilong was punched in the chest and fell to the ground because he did not answer.

The cruel and barbaric circumstances of Zhang Zilong's brutal murder on October 3 were even worse than the atrocities of the Nazis in the Buchenwald and Auschwitz hells on earth.

This happened when secret agent elements coerced prisoners of war to hold "demonstrations" against the Indian custodial forces for two consecutive days. On the first day, Zhang Zilong was beaten with blood and dirt all over his face because he refused to wave the flag and shout slogans, and the blood on his head flowed all night. Early in the morning of the second day, the murderers announced Zhang Zilong's death sentence, hanging the comatose Zhang Zilong horizontally on the tent beam, burning his belly with paper, pouring kerosene on his body, cutting off large pieces of flesh all over his body that had been forcibly tattooed, nailing one-and-a-half-inch-long nails into the top of his forehead, inserting six- or seven-inch-long knife tips into his temples, cutting off his ears, cutting off his genitals, breaking his belly, inserting a round shovel into his chest, and digging out his heart, liver, and lungs. The murderers cooked the dug-out heart, liver, and lungs and ate them. The murderer, the third company commander, had oil all over his hands and threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "Whoever wants to go back will not only eat your heart and liver, but also eat your meat!"

I ask all honest people, what is this if not a living hell? This bloody crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war has often occurred in the American prisoner-of-war camps in Jeju Island, Geoje Island, and Busan in the past. But now this is happening in a camp where prisoners of war are guaranteed to have complete freedom to return home. The American side is still shamelessly talking about "humanitarianism" to cover up its plan to sabotage the explanation work. The Swiss and Swedish members of the NNRC also clamor that the explanation time of our explanation representatives to the prisoners of war is "too long" and "inhumane." However, the Zhang Zilong incident proves which side is really humanitarian? The members of the NNRC, who guarantee that prisoners of war have the right to exercise their repatriation and handle the Zhang Zilong incident with one hand, should be able to fully answer this question.

"That's Him!"

Those who were designated as witnesses and broke through the control of secret agents to return home during the NNRC's investigation of the Zhang Zilong incident were filled with hatred for Zhang Zilong's persecution and brutal murder, and had endless things to say. Among them were volunteers among the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who had been detained in the same camp or team with Zhang Zilong, as well as eight Chinese fishermen, including 70-year-old Grandpa Yu Xiangfa and his son, who were abducted by the American-Li bandit navy when they invaded our territorial waters. They also suffered various persecutions and threats, and could hardly believe that they could come back.

The returning captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army said that Zhang Zilong had always been watched by secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camp. He insisted on going home from beginning to end and was endlessly persecuted. The American-Chiang secret agents used the persecution of Zhang Zilong to create terror, attempting to coerce the prisoners of war into not daring to demand to go home.

On the day when the secret agents forced the prisoners of war to sign a "joint guarantee" after the signing of the armistice agreement, no one dared to guarantee Zhang Zilong, because the prisoners of war were afraid that the secret agents were playing tricks again. If they guaranteed him, they would be bitten as colluding with Zhang Zilong and suffer. Sure enough, at this time, the secret agent elements shouted: "That's right, this distinguishes the good people from the bad people." But then they said: "It's good for everyone to know clearly. Everyone still has to guarantee him, let the whole squad guarantee him, everyone must keep an eye on him, and report immediately if you see anything, otherwise you will be punished together."

When the murderer secret agent brutally murdered Zhang Zilong, he pointed at the prisoners of war and threatened:
"Whoever wants to return to the mainland will be like Zhang Zilong." Grandpa Fisherman was also pulled to see it, and 56-year-old Zhang Shuliang fell to the ground in fright as soon as he entered the tent. At night, he dared not sleep soundly, often waking up in shock, afraid of talking in his sleep. He told reporters: "You didn't see it, it's scary enough. If the fire is put out, you will die." The fishermen's desire to go home, which was deeply buried in their hearts, almost disappeared. Only one fisherman was still strong and felt that he had no way to survive anyway, so he desperately climbed out of the barbed wire.

When six fishermen were taken out of the camp as witnesses on the day of the investigation, they were still a little scared because they did not know the truth. When they testified against the murderers across a barbed wire fence, they found that secret agent elements had mixed in among the witnesses, so they dared not say a word. Even when the staff of the NNRC asked them if they wanted to go home, they could not speak. At this time, three witnesses, one of whom was the old fisherman Zhang Shuliang, had testified and were being taken away after demanding to go home, shouted loudly to the six fishermen who were standing there in a daze: "You are going home, say it quickly, come with us." The six fishermen wanted to look up, but were frightened by the secret agent elements. The secret agent elements said to them: "Go back to No. 5 (Camp 28)." When they heard back to No. 5, their heads swelled as if they were about to explode. It was not until the secret agent elements were taken away that they became bolder. 70-year-old Yu Xiangfa first said to the staff of the NNRC: "I can speak boldly now, I'll say it, I want to go home." The others immediately said in unison that they wanted to go home, and could not help but cry bitterly. An old man, Lu Kewei, stepped forward and answered the inquiry of the staff of the NNRC (the general idea is as follows):

Question: Did you see Zhang Zilong being killed?
Answer: I saw it. I saw him being hung up, with big holes cut in both arms and his ears cut off. He was still a little bit alive at that time.
Question: How was he hung?
Answer: With his hands and feet up and his belly down.
Question: Where was he hung?
Answer: Hung in the tent of the Third Company.
Question: Do you know the Third Company Commander?
Answer: (Pointing angrily at the murderer, the Third Company Commander, across the barbed wire fence, and said fiercely) That's him!

Is there any more eloquent evidence than the testimony of this simple old fisherman to prove the criminal fact that the American-Chiang secret agents murdered Zhang Zilong and used bloody terrorist violence to coerce prisoners of war into not daring to demand to go home?

"That's him!" - The fishermen's angry testimony vividly shows how deep the hatred our captured personnel have for the crimes of the American-Chiang secret agents in forcibly detaining prisoners of war!

Not An Isolated Individual Incident

The truth of the American-Chiang secret agents' brutality in murdering Zhang Zilong is out in the open. Now, the fair work of the NNRC should mainly be to conduct a thorough investigation and, based on the investigation, eliminate the secret agent forces in Camp 28 and even the entire Dongjang-ri camp.

The noisy propagandists of the American side pretend to be calm about the exposure of this crime. But the fact that the American side instructed secret agents to once again interrupt the explanation work for a long time proves that it is still brazenly trying to bury the explanation work at all costs. It is particularly noteworthy that the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNRC, especially the Swiss member, even claimed at this time that the secret agent control of prisoners of war was "unfounded." This is very strange. Can the Swiss member still say that he does not understand the rampant situation of secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camp in the face of the fact that Zhang Zilong was killed?

In fact, as long as the NNRC conducts a thorough investigation, it will further prove that the Zhang Zilong incident is by no means an individual incident, let alone an isolated murder incident in an individual camp.

The returning personnel Chang Fei'e, a health worker from the former Camp 28, once brought a letter from the murderer's battalion commander Zhang Yuwang to Zhang Zunxian, the "principal" of the CIE "school" living in Camp 25, on September 26, asking for instructions on the murder of Zhang Zilong. On September 29, Zhang Zunxian sent back a letter of instructions to Zhang Yuwang, which was brought back by Chang Fei'e. Zhang Zilong was killed a few days later. The CIE "school" in each camp area and its CIE organization in each camp were institutions set up by the American Army Headquarters secret agent organization before the American side handed over the prisoner-of-war camp to the NNRC for custody. They were controlled by Taiwan Kuomintang secret agents who had been trained in Tokyo, and were specially used to conduct deceptive "education" and brutal persecution of our captured personnel. This institution still exists in the Dongjang-ri camp and is intensifying various sabotage activities. At the same time, people have long known that there are also some figures such as "Teacher Ma" and organizations of so-called general liaison stations in the Dongjang-ri camp who are directing. This is the evil secret agent force system. It is this secret agent force that is controlling the prisoners of war and sabotaging the work of the NNRC.

The investigation process of the Zhang Zilong incident also proved that the secret agent forces in the Dongjang-ri camp were doing evil in a planned way, controlling the prisoners of war, and sabotaging the investigation work.

In the days before the investigation, the secret agents of Camp 28 knew that the NNRC was coming to investigate, and immediately dug up the corpse and burned it, attempting to destroy the evidence. Is this accidental?

On the first day of the on-site investigation, because the NNRC and the Indian custodial forces did not take effective measures, the secret agents coerced the prisoners of war to create chaos and sabotage the investigation work. Is this rampant action that blatantly disregards the jurisdiction of the NNRC also an accidental thing?

On the evening of the day the second day's investigation ended, the so-called "regimental commander" of the D camp area immediately convened a meeting of the battalion commanders of each camp in Camp 28 to replenish and strengthen the secret agent control force of Camp 28. This cannot be said to be irrelevant.

These lawless secret agent forces are by no means "leaders of prisoners of war who are not related to foreign secret agents," but are connected to the American Army Headquarters, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, and act according to their orders and plans. Therefore, they dare to despise, obstruct, and sabotage the jurisdiction of the NNRC. This evil force is now attempting to sabotage the armistice in Korea.

However, the tricks played by this evil force cannot see the light of day. If the NNRC resolutely adheres to the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," it is entirely possible to eliminate this secret agent force in the camp. Doing so will inevitably gain the support of the people of the world. And only in this way can the NNRC escape the current crisis in order to carry out its work smoothly.

    张子龙惨案说明了什么
    本报记者　胡今
    张子龙因坚持要求遣返而被美蒋特务杀害的事件，这几天仍由中立国遣返委员会向我方作证人员进行调查中。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅在四日就表示“已获充分证据”。但是，美方指使特务破坏解释工作的活动也变本加厉，使解释工作又连续中断了六天，并陷于严重的危险阶段。这显然证明，张子龙事件所揭露的当前解释工作中的关键问题，值得引起中立国遣返委员会的重视。
    彻头彻尾的强迫扣留战俘
    张子龙被俘后长期遭受迫害，最后被惨杀的经过，集中地反映了我方被俘人员所受到的非人道的、违反人类尊严和国际法规的待遇，突出地暴露了美方彻头彻尾地强迫扣留战俘的罪恶。
    张子龙在一九五一年五月被俘后，从在釜山、济州岛的美方战俘营起，一直到中立国遣返委员会看管的战俘营，自始至终坚持要求遣返，因而受尽了磨折和迫害。
    一九五二年四月，美方在停战谈判桌上口口声声说的什么“自愿遣返”的谎言，被我方被俘人员接二连三的斗争所揭穿后，便开始玩一套所谓“公正的甄别”的把戏，来对要求遣返的我方被俘人员实行新的威胁和迫害。但我方被俘人员的斗争更为高涨，杜德事件便是一个有力的证明。“甄别”后，美方强行把我方被俘人员分为坚决要求遣返的与所谓“拒绝遣返”的两类加以隔离看管。前者被集中拘留的战俘营，我方被俘人员称之为“回国战俘营”；美方所谓“拒绝遣返”的我方被俘人员，仍纷纷继续进行斗争，要求送到“回国战俘营”去。
    张子龙就是这样的一个战俘。他在釜山美方战俘营“甄别”时就勇敢地要求遣返，并为表示决心，拒绝吃美方发的粮食，宁愿忍受饥饿吃草根，但美方把他送回所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘营中的蒋匪特务手里。一九五二年七月，张子龙被移送到济州岛木索浦战俘营。到了那里不久，张子龙曾三次翻出铁丝网，企图逃跑到“回国战俘营”去，都被美军抓回原营场。自此以后，张子龙就经常受到酷刑拷打。同时，美方通过特务对全体我方被俘人员特别是对所谓“拒绝遣返”的我方被俘人员的迫害也更加厉害。一九五三年三、四月间的“清查回国分子运动”，就是一次大规模的残酷迫害的罪行。张子龙在这次“运动”中几乎被乱棍打死。
    停战后，坚决要求遣返的张子龙，并没有被直接遣返，而是被列为“不直接遣返”战俘，送到东场里二十八号营场，继续处在原封不动的蒋匪特务的控制之下。由于张子龙仍旧坚持回家，美蒋特务就把他杀害了。
    这一笔血债清楚地说明了：不论是在美方直接拘留期间，或是在中立国遣返委员会看管期间，张子龙遭受到的迫害以至被惨杀，都是出于美方一贯强迫扣留战俘的一双血手的。美方破坏解释工作的秘密也就在这里。
      人道究竟在哪一边
    美方指使蒋李特务迫害战俘、阻挠战俘回家的恶毒手段很多，除了强迫战俘听反动课，欺骗和利诱，以及用强迫刺字、写血书、参加反动组织和其他下流堕落方式来摧毁战俘的人格、尊严和道德以外，就是对战俘实行恐怖的暴力统治，把战俘推到死亡的边缘。
    张子龙一身就经受了我方被俘人员所受到的种种迫害，而且是无休止地每时每刻被迫害。他曾被罚监禁、罚苦役、两天不给饭吃、不给睡觉、打耳光、脚踢、罚跪……这算是日常的小事。他一次又一次地被毒打，打几大棒算是轻罚。当他在“清查回国分子运动”中被“清查”出来后，曾被毒打了二百多棍，两次昏死过去；一个钟头后清醒了过来，又被罚两手举着一个盛满五加仑水的水桶，两脚半弯曲，脚跟抬起，站在一根木头上。
    到了东场里营场后的九月十八日，张子龙因拒绝喊反动口号，就连续两天被罚头顶一碗水，两眼直视太阳，双手平举盛满水的水盆两小时余，每当手软目眩水溢时就遭棍打。从此以后特务分子每天逼问他“你回那里去”，每次张子龙都因不回答而被拳击胸部昏倒地上。
    十月三日，张子龙被惨杀的残酷野蛮情形，比纳粹在布痕瓦尔德和奥斯威辛人间地狱的暴行还有过之。
    这是发生在特务分子胁迫战俘连续两天举行反对印度看管部队的“示威游行”的时候。第一天张子龙由于拒绝摇旗喊口号，就已被打得满脸又是血又是土，头上的血流了一整夜。第二天一清早，杀人犯们宣布张子龙的死刑，把昏迷的张子龙横吊在帐篷梁上，用纸烧肚皮，倒火油烧身，大块地割掉全身被强迫刺了字的肉，用一寸半长的钉钉入脑门顶，用六、七寸长的刀尖插入太阳穴，割耳朵，割生殖器，破肚皮，在胸口上插一把圆锹，挖心肝肺。杀人犯们把挖出的心肝肺煮熟来吃，凶手三中队长吃得两手是油，并威胁战俘说：“谁要回去，不但吃你的心肝，连你的肉还要吃了！”
    试问所有正直的人们，这不是活地狱是什么？这种强迫扣留战俘的血腥罪行，在过去的济州岛、巨济岛、釜山等地美方战俘营里，也曾常常发生；但现在这是发生在战俘被保证应有回家的完全自由的营场里。美方还在厚颜无耻地说什么“人道主义”，用来掩盖它破坏解释工作的计划。中立国遣返委员会的瑞士、瑞典委员也叫嚷什么我方解释代表向战俘的解释时间“过长”“不人道”。可是，张子龙事件证明人道究竟在那一边呢？一手保证战俘有行使其被遣返的权利，一手处理张子龙事件的中立国遣返委员会委员，是应该完全能够回答这个问题的。
    “就是他！”
    在中立国遣返委员会调查张子龙事件时被指作证和冲破特务控制遣返归来的人员，对张子龙的被迫害和惨杀，满怀仇恨，诉说不尽。其中有一直和张子龙一起被拘留在同一营场或小队的志愿军被俘人员，也有八个被美李匪帮海军侵犯我国领海时掳去的我国渔民，包括七十岁的老大爷于祥发和他的儿子，他们也遭受了各种迫害和恐吓，简直不敢相信能够回来。
    归来的志愿军被俘人员说，张子龙在战俘营中一直就是被特务注视的人，他自始至终坚持回家，无休止地遭到迫害，美蒋特务用对张子龙的迫害来制造恐怖，企图胁迫战俘不敢要求回家。
    停战协定签字后特务强迫战俘订“连环保”的一天，没有人敢和张子龙保，因为战俘们都害怕特务又在玩诡计，如果保了他，会被咬是和张子龙串通而吃苦头。果然，这时特务分子就叫起来：“对啦，这就分出好人和坏人来了。”但接着又说：“大家认识清楚就好了，大家还要保他，让全小队来保，每个人都要盯住他，看见了什么就马上报告，否则要一并处分。”
    凶手特务惨杀张子龙时，并指着战俘恐吓说：
  “谁要回大陆，就和张子龙一个样。”渔民老大爷也被拉去看，五十六岁的张书良一进帐篷就吓得倒在地上，到了晚上，睡也不敢熟睡，时常惊醒，怕说梦话。他对记者说：“你没有看见，可够怕了。扑了火就得死。”渔民们深深地埋在心底里的回家愿望几乎无影无踪了。只有一个渔民还身壮力强，觉得横竖没得活路，就拚死爬出了铁丝网。
    当六个渔民在调查的那一天被指作证带出营场后，因为不明真相，还有些害怕。他们在面对隔着一层铁丝网的凶手作证时，发现有特务分子混入作证人中间，他们就不敢哼一声。连中立国遣返委员会工作人员问他们是不是要求回家时，他们也说不出话。这时，有三个作证人，其中一个是老渔民张书良，作过证，要求回家，正被带走，便向呆在那里的六个渔民高声喊道：“你们是要回家的，快快说，跟我们一道走吧。”这六个渔民想抬头看一看，又被特务分子吓住了。特务分子对他们说：“回五号（二十八号营场）去。”他们一听到回五号，头就胀大得像要炸开来。直到特务分子被带走后，他们胆子才大起来。七十岁的于祥发首先对中立国遣返委员会工作人员说：“可以大胆说话了，我就说啦，我要回家。”其他的人也立刻同声说要回家，并且不禁痛哭起来。有一个老大爷吕克威站前一步答复中立国遣返委员会工作人员的询问（大意如此）：
    问：张子龙被杀死，你看见吗？
    答：看见。我看见他被吊起来，两臂割了大窟窿，耳朵也被割了，那时他还有点气。
    问：怎么吊的？
    答：手脚朝上，肚皮朝下。
    问：吊在那里？
    答：吊在三中队帐篷里。
    问：三中队长你认得不认得？
    答：（愤恨地指着对面的隔着铁丝网的凶手三中队长，狠狠地说）就是他！
    还有什么比这朴实的老渔民的指证更雄辩的证据来证明美蒋特务杀害张子龙并以血腥恐怖暴行来胁迫战俘不敢要求回家的罪恶事实吗？
      “就是他！”——渔民们的愤怒的作证，生动地说明了我方被俘人员对美蒋特务强迫扣留战俘的罪行，是怀着多么深重的仇恨啊！
      不是孤立的个别事件
    美蒋特务谋杀张子龙的暴行真相，大白于天下了。现在，中立国遣返委员会的公正的工作，主要是应该进行彻底的调查并根据调查把二十八号营场以至整个东场里营场的特务势力加以清除。
    美方喧嚣的宣传家们对这个罪行的暴露，故作镇静。但美方指使特务又一次长期阻断解释工作证明了，它仍悍然不顾一切地企图葬送解释工作。值得特别注意的是，中立国遣返委员会的瑞士、瑞典委员尤其是瑞士委员，竟然在这个时候声言特务控制战俘是“没有根据的”。这是很奇怪的，难道瑞士委员面对着张子龙被杀害的事实还能够说不了解战俘营中的特务嚣张的情形吗？
    事实上，中立国遣返委员会只要进行彻底调查，还会进一步证明张子龙事件决不是个别事件，更不是个别营场的孤立的凶杀事件。
    归来人员常飞锷、前二十八号营场的卫生员，曾在九月二十六日带凶手大队长张宇旺的一封信给住在二十五号营场的CIE“学校”“校长”张遵贤，请示谋杀张子龙的事。九月二十九日，张遵贤又由常飞锷带回给张宇旺一封指示信。过几天张子龙就被杀了。各营区的CIE“学校”及其在各营场的CIE组织，是美军总部特务组织在美方把战俘营移交给中立国遣返委员会负责看管以前就设立了的机构，由曾在东京受训的台湾国民党特务所控制，专门用来向我方被俘人员进行欺骗“教育”和酷刑迫害。这个机构现在仍然在东场里营场里继续存在并加紧进行各种破坏活动。同时，人们也早已知道，在东场里营场里还有“马老师”一些人物和所谓总联络站的组织在进行指挥。这就是万恶的特务势力系统，正是这种特务势力在控制战俘，破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作。
    张子龙事件的调查过程，也证明了东场里营场特务势力在有计划地为非作歹，控制战俘，破坏调查工作。
    在调查的前几天，二十八号营场特务就知道中立国遣返委员会要来调查，立即掘起尸首烧毁，企图消灭罪证。这难道是偶然的吗？
    现场调查的第一天，由于中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队没有采取有效措施，特务就胁迫战俘制造混乱，破坏了调查工作。这种公然无视中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的猖狂行动，又难道是偶然的事吗？
    第二天调查结束的当天晚上，D号营区的所谓“联队长”立即在二十八号营场召集各营场大队长开会，补充并加强二十八号营场的特务控制力量。这更不能说是无关重要的事了。
    这些无法无天的特务势力，决不是什么“与外来的特务不相干的战俘的领袖分子”，而是与美军总部、李承晚匪帮和蒋介石残匪气息相通，并奉它们的命令和计划行事，因而敢于蔑视、阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的一种罪恶势力。这种势力现在正在企图破坏朝鲜的停战。
    不过，这种罪恶势力所干的勾当，是见不得日光的。如果中立国遣返委员会坚决遵照“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”办事，就完全可能在营场中清除这种特务势力；这样做，也必然会得到世界人民的支持的，而且也只有这样，中立国遣返委员会才能脱出目前的危机，以便顺利进行工作。
                            （十一月十三日）
