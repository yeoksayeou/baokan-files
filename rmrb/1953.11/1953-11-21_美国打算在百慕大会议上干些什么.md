    Easing international tensions is currently the most important issue in the minds of people in all countries. The Soviet government proposed a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to discuss concrete measures to ease international tensions. This initiative has been welcomed by world opinion. It is generally known that discussing these measures would help resolve the German question. People of all countries believe that the Soviet initiative is a new step towards consolidating peace and international security.
    The reactionary elements in the United States, however, hold a different view. Instead of hoping for a relaxation of tensions, they are trying to maintain this tension, and even make it worse. The comments of the American bourgeois press on the upcoming Bermuda Conference of the United States, Britain, and France vividly demonstrate this point. As everyone knows, this conference is a unilateral one, and it runs counter to the policy of easing international tensions. The American newspapers are trying to pre-justify the new collusion of the Western countries at the Bermuda Conference. They are trying to avoid mentioning the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov at a press conference on November 13, and blatantly insist that this statement does not contain anything new, trying to diminish its significance in this way. Not a single American bourgeois newspaper published the full text of Molotov's statement, or even the most important paragraphs. Not a single newspaper mentioned the part of Molotov's statement that addressed the inconsistency in the attitudes of the three countries towards the German question and expressed the Soviet Union's desire to clarify this aspect.
    The American bourgeois newspapers demand that the Western countries, when formulating their plans, take into account the factor that the "Cold War" will continue. The "New York Herald Tribune" and other newspapers admit that at the upcoming Bermuda Conference, the United States intends to make its Western partners completely abandon any hope of holding any talks with the Soviet Union in the near future, and resolutely demand that they intensify the arms race. "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Russell said, "President Eisenhower's main purpose in going to Bermuda is to push forward his European policy with a jolt."
    Judging from the comments in the American newspapers, the United States believes that the main purpose of the Bermuda Conference is to put pressure on the Western European countries to force them to quickly ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties, and to promote the plan to rearm West Germany. The "Wall Street Journal" bluntly stated: At the Bermuda Conference, the United States will place special emphasis on the European Defense Community (i.e., the European Army). Some newspapers admit that at the conference, not only will the United States and Britain put pressure on France, but Bonn’s Chancellor Adenauer (whom they call the "invisible participant" of the conference) will also put pressure on France.
    At the same time, the American newspapers cannot hide the fact that the views of the United States, Britain, and France are very inconsistent on the question of what the purpose of the Bermuda Conference is. The "New York American Journal" talked about considerable differences between London and Washington. Britain, on the one hand, in principle agrees that it is necessary to further intensify war preparations in Europe, but on the other hand, it is afraid that the United States will increase the tension of the international situation, and therefore wants to exert a binding influence on the United States.
    The latest issue of "Time" magazine talked about the differences between the United States and Britain, saying that the relationship between the United States and Britain is worse than most Americans think. It listed some facts to illustrate the contradictions between the United States and Britain, such as in their attitudes towards the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, in their policies in Europe and the Middle East, etc.
    The "New York Herald Tribune" correspondent in Paris said: As for France, the Bermuda Conference is being held at the worst possible time for the French rulers. "The New York Times" and other newspapers pointed out: The strong resistance in France to the "European Army" plan has made the position of the French cabinet unstable. These newspapers believe that the French representatives attending the conference will find it difficult to assume any concrete obligations.
    "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Russell commented on the differences among the participants in the Bermuda Conference, saying: "There is no common factor that prompted them to hold the Bermuda Conference... They have not reached a basic agreement on the question of whether the conference is necessary."

### 美国打算在百慕大会议上干些什么

    美国打算在百慕大会议上干些什么
    缓和国际紧张局势是一切国家人民目前心目中最重要的问题。苏联政府建议在美国、英国、法国、苏联与中华人民共和国的外长会议上讨论缓和国际紧张局势的具体措施。这个倡议受到全世界舆论的欢迎。大家知道，讨论这些措施会有助于德国问题的解决。各国人民认为苏联的倡议是巩固和平与国际安全的新步骤。
    美国的反动分子的见解却不一样。他们非但不希望紧张局势缓和，反而设法保持这种紧张局势，甚至使它更加恶化。美国资产阶级报纸对于美、英、法三国即将举行的百慕大会议的评论，就生动地证明了这一点。大家知道，这个会议是一个片面的会议，是与缓和国际紧张局势的政策背道而驰的。美国报纸正在设法为西方国家在百慕大会议上的新勾结预先辩护。他们设法避而不谈苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫十一月十三日在记者招待会上的声明，并露骨地硬说这一声明并没有什么新的内容，想这样来减低它的重大意义。美国资产阶级报纸没有一家发表莫洛托夫声明的全文，甚至没有发表其中最重要的段落。没有一家报纸提到莫洛托夫的声明中关于三国在德国问题上态度不一致并表示苏联希望在这方面得到澄清的一段。
    美国资产阶级报纸要求西方国家在拟定它们的计划的时候，考虑到“冷战”要继续下去这一因素。“纽约先驱论坛报”和其它一些报纸承认，在即将举行的百慕大会议上，美国打算使它的西方伙伴完全放弃在最近将来与苏联举行任何会谈的希望，并坚决要求它们加紧军备竞赛。“纽约先驱论坛报”记者鲁塞尔说，“艾森豪威尔总统到百慕大去的主要目的是要猛然推进一下他的欧洲政策。”
    从美国报纸的评论看来，美国认为百慕大会议的主要目的就是：对西欧国家施以压力，以迫使它们迅速批准波恩与巴黎战争条约，并促进重新武装西德的计划。“华尔街日报”露骨地说：在百慕大会议上，美国将特别着重欧洲防务集团（即欧洲军）。有些报纸承认：在会上，不仅美国和英国将对法国施以压力，就是波恩总理阿登纳（它们称他为会议的“不露面的参加者”）也将对法国施以压力。
      同时美国报纸也无法隐瞒，在百慕大会议目的何在这样一个问题上，美国、英国和法国的看法很不一致。“纽约美国人日报”谈到伦敦与华盛顿之间相当大的分歧。英国一方面在原则上赞成必须进一步加紧欧洲的战争准备，但是另一方面它害怕美国增加国际局势的紧张程度，因此想给美国加以一种约束性的影响。
    最近一期的“时代”杂志谈到美英的分歧说：美国与英国的关系比大多数美国人所料想的坏得多。它列举了一些事实，说明美英之间的矛盾，例如在对苏联与中华人民共和国的态度上、在欧洲及中东的政策上等。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”驻巴黎记者说：至于法国，百慕大会议对法国统治者说来，开得最不是时候。“纽约时报”和其他报纸指出：“欧洲军”计划遭到法国强烈的反抗，这使得法国内阁的地位不稳。这些报纸认为，出席会议的法国代表将难以承担任何具体义务。
        “纽约先驱论坛报”记者鲁塞尔就百慕大会议参加者之间的分歧发表评论说：“没有任何共同的因素促使他们召开百慕大会议……在会议是否必要这样一个问题上，他们没有取得基本的协议。”
