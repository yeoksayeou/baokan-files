Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 25th: As the Indonesian government dispatches an economic delegation to visit the People's Republic of China, Indonesian public opinion is filled with hope for the development of normal trade relations between Indonesia and China. At the same time, it condemns the adverse effects of US interference in free trade on the Indonesian economy, especially the recent blatant US interference in Indonesian internal affairs.

    Irawan Bandung, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Plantation Workers' Union, told a reporter from "Indonesia News" on November 11 that he hoped that Sino-Indonesian trade would provide good security for the folk rubber industry in Jambi, Palembang, and other places, which are facing bankruptcy due to the US "embargo" policy.

    On the same day, Suyonigoro, Secretary-General of the Indonesian National Enterprise Joint Organization, told a reporter from "Indonesia News" that the measures taken by the Indonesian government to "save the folk rubber industry from bankruptcy have brought new hope to the country." He emphasized that the US "embargo" policy has caused "economic instability" and "imbalance in foreign trade" in Indonesia.

    Well-known figures in the Indonesian parliament have expressed strong opposition to the US attempt to intensify pressure on Indonesia. Asin, chief representative of the parliamentary delegation of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers' Union, told a reporter from "Independent News" on November 13 that the US opposition to Indonesia selling raw materials such as rubber, tin, and sugar to China illustrates US interference in Indonesian internal affairs. Currently, the US is further using economic pressure on Indonesia; the current issue is how to overcome this pressure from the US. Parliamentarian Rasuna Said spoke to a reporter from the Indonesian "People's Daily" regarding the US's threatening remarks towards Indonesia, saying: "Indonesian politicians are not afraid of US intimidation."

    At the same time, Indonesian newspapers have published editorials opposing the US "embargo" policy. An editorial in Surabaya's "Peace News" on November 9 stated: "In view of the US's implementation of unjust trade policies, Indonesia must seek other markets without delay." The newspaper also said: "Establishing trade relations between Indonesia and China is equivalent to finding a quarter of the world's market."

    "Independent News" published another editorial on this issue on November 11, saying: "We do not want to be manipulated by the United States in the matter of selling our raw materials, regardless of whether there is a (US) war bill." "Spring News" also published an editorial on November 13, saying: "For the benefit of our country, the government should continue to work hard to find a way to break through the US 'embargo'."

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 25th: After news spread that the United States was attempting to enlist the support of Britain and France to jointly interfere in Indonesian internal affairs and include the "Indonesian issue" on the agenda of the Bermuda Tripartite Conference, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo made a statement on the 23rd, expressing his opposition.

    According to the Indonesian Antara News Agency on the 24th, quoting the Indonesian "Torch Daily" as saying: "The Indonesian cabinet prime minister believes that the 'Indonesian issue' is a matter for the Indonesian people themselves." He expressed "regret" that these countries attempted to discuss the Indonesian issue at the conference without obtaining Indonesia's consent.

    Antara News Agency reported: "Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo told the 'Torch Daily' that the Indonesian government would consider any decision made at the conference regarding Indonesia without prior consultation with the Indonesian government to be non-binding." "The Prime Minister also stated that until now, the relevant parties have not formally or informally notified the Indonesian government. The Prime Minister finally said: Until now, it is still unknown why Indonesia should be included on the Bermuda Conference agenda."

    印尼舆论希望和我国发展正常贸易关系
    印尼总理不满美国干涉印尼内政的企图
    【新华社二十五日讯】雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚政府派遣经济代表团访问中华人民共和国之际，印尼舆论满怀希望地期待发展印（尼）中两国之间的正常贸易关系，同时并斥责美国干涉贸易的自由给印尼经济所造成的恶果，特别是美国最近对印尼内政的粗暴干涉。
    印尼种植园工人工会中央委员会第二书记伊拉宛·班都十一日对“印尼新闻报”记者说：他希望中印（尼）贸易将使占碑、巨港等地因遭受美国的“禁运”政策打击而面临破产的民间橡胶业，获得一个良好的保障。
    同一天，印尼民族企业联合机构秘书长苏约尼哥罗对“印尼新闻报”记者说：印尼政府所采取的“挽救民间橡胶业免于破产的措施，已给国内带来了新的希望”。他强调说：美国的“禁运”政策使印尼“经济不稳”和“对外贸易不平衡”。
    印尼国会著名人士对于美国力图借此加紧向印尼施加压力，表示强烈的反对。印尼回教教师联合会的国会议员团首席代表阿辛十三日对“独立报”记者说：美国反对印尼出卖橡胶、锡、糖等原料给中国，说明了美国干涉印尼的内政。目前美国对印尼进一步使用经济的压力；当前的问题就在于如何克服这种来自美国的压力。国会议员拉苏娜·萨依特就美国发表威胁印尼的言论对印尼“人民日报”记者发表谈话说：“印尼的政治家不怕美国的恐吓。”
    与此同时，印尼报刊纷纷发表社论反对美国的“禁运”政策。泗水“和平报”九日的社论说：
  “鉴于美国实行不公正的贸易政策，印尼必须毫不迟缓地找寻其他市场。”该报并说：“印尼与中国建立贸易关系就等于找到了世界四分之一的市场。”
  “独立报”十一日再度就这一问题发表社论说：“我们不愿在售卖我们的原料问题上受到美国的摆布，不管有没有（美国的）战争法案。”“泉源报”十三日也发表社论说：“为了我们国家的利益，政府应该继续努力从事找寻突破美国‘禁运’的途径。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】雅加达消息：在美国企图拉拢英法两国一同干涉印尼内政、把“印尼问题”列入百慕大三国会议议程这一消息传出后，印尼内阁总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约二十三日发表了谈话，表示反对。
    据印尼安塔拉通讯社二十四日引述印尼“火炬日报”的消息说：“印尼内阁总理认为‘印尼问题’是印尼人自己的事情。”他对于这些国家没有征得印尼的同意就企图在会议上讨论印尼的问题，表示“遗憾”。
    安塔拉通讯社报道说：“总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约对‘火炬日报’说，对于任何国家事先没有和印尼政府商量就在会议上作出有关印尼的决定，印尼政府将认为是没有束缚力的。”“总理并声明，到现在为止，有关方面一直没有正式或非正式地通知印尼政府。总理最后说：直到现在仍然不知道有什么理由要把印尼列入百慕大会议议程。”
