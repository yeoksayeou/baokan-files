Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 13th: V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, held a press conference on November 13th, attended by representatives of the Soviet press and foreign journalists stationed in Moscow.

    At the beginning of the press conference, Molotov issued the following statement:

    On November 3rd, the Soviet Government sent a note to the British, American, and French governments regarding the question of convening a Foreign Ministers’ meeting.

    In its note, the Soviet Government proposed convening a Foreign Ministers' meeting in order to: First, examine measures to ease international tensions at a meeting attended by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China; Second, discuss the German question and related issues of ensuring European security at a meeting attended by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

    This note from the Soviet Government has sparked widespread discussion among foreign officials and newspapers of various persuasions, as it raises issues whose resolution is of great significance to consolidating peace and international security.

    The Soviet government's proposals have been welcomed in social circles in many countries.

    These proposals have been viewed differently by officials and some newspapers in the United States, Great Britain, and France. U.S. President Eisenhower even described the note as "negative," insisting that the Soviet note did not express a willingness to hold a meeting. This statement is clearly contrary to the facts.

    Now, the question of convening a Foreign Ministers’ meeting has become the focus of world public opinion. The claim that the Soviet Union has not expressed a willingness to hold a meeting cannot deceive those who understand the situation. It is easy to see that the situation is completely the opposite. We might mention that, just recently, the Soviet Union has raised the issue of convening a Foreign Ministers’ meeting with the United States, Great Britain, and France governments three times, on August 4th, September 28th, and November 3rd.

    However, the problem is not only that the Soviet Government wants to convene a Foreign Ministers’ meeting, but the U.S., British, and French governments do not want to convene it. No one can deny that these four governments have all expressed their support for convening a Foreign Ministers’ meeting. However, they have not yet reached a consensus on the question of what the purpose of such a meeting should be.

    As for the Soviet Union's attitude on this issue, it has been explained in detail in the November 3rd note. Our attitude is that if the purpose of the Foreign Ministers’ meeting is to ease international tensions, such a meeting is necessary and useful. Judging from certain statements made by the U.S., British, and French governments, they are also in favor of easing international tensions. However, it is clear that merely talking about being in favor of easing international tensions is one thing, and taking real steps in this regard is another.

    We believe that holding such a meeting is to take a step in the direction of consolidating peace and international security. The purpose should be to study measures to ease international tensions and to discuss the German question (including the restoration of German unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty). Solving the German question is closely related to European security, and thus closely related to easing international tensions.

    But the U.S., British, and French governments have taken a different attitude. They refuse to study the issue of easing international tensions, and attempt to make the discussion of the German question subservient to the purpose of accelerating the remilitarization of Germany, rather than subservient to the purpose of restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.

    You can judge for yourselves: Can taking this path help to consolidate peace and international security? Our Soviet answer to this question is: It is impossible to consider this as a step forward in the direction of consolidating peace; doing so will not help to ease international tensions.

    In this situation, why propose holding a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting in Lugano? Obviously, it is not for the purpose of genuinely striving to solve pressing international problems and ease international tensions. After the note proposing the Lugano meeting was published, a U.S. State Department spokesman immediately stated that even if the Lugano meeting were held, it was highly doubtful whether everyone could ultimately reach an agreement. This expression is certainly not accidental.

    Professor Gerretson, a member of the Dutch Parliament, recently wrote an article arguing that the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France can be considered an attempt to achieve a negative outcome in all discussions regarding the convening of a Four-Power meeting. He said, "There is every reason to conclude that this failure is precisely their true goal."

    Of course, one can talk a lot about holding a Four-Power meeting because one cannot ignore the broad international public opinion that sympathizes with holding such a meeting, but in reality, make these talks worthless. The Soviet Union takes a completely different attitude toward this issue. For the Soviet Union, a meeting is not an object of speculation. We are concerned about holding a meeting to solve pressing international problems because we want to ease international tensions, and we want to consolidate peace and international security.

    It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union has in the past and now proposes that the United States, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China discuss the issue of easing international tensions together. No one can deny that the participation of the People's Republic of China is very important in solving pressing international problems. No one can seriously talk about solving pressing international problems without addressing the relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. In order to thoroughly resolve the Korean question (including the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the unification of Korea), it is also important for other countries to respect the legitimate interests of the great People's Republic of China, an Asian country. Reaching an agreement on holding a five-power conference with China's participation in itself would mean that a major step has been taken towards easing international tensions and consolidating peace.

    Mr. Eden recently said in the House of Commons that whether the tensions between East and West can be eased depends entirely on the Soviet government. This statement is certainly not convincing. Does the "West" not bear the main responsibility for their current divisions with Eastern countries? On the other hand, the fact is very clear that China's participation in a five-power conference would be a major step in reducing the divisions between the West and the East.

    All of this shows that if we truly hope to solve major international problems, the key lies in discussing the issue of easing international tensions.

    However, proposing to discuss easing international tensions does not mean immediately solving all the urgent problems between the East and the West all at once. It would be wrong to put it that way. No one can agree to such an oversimplified explanation; this is a distortion of the original intention of the proposal. However, it is also wrong to constrain the meeting in advance, because the meeting should itself decide what resolutions can help to ease international tensions now.

    In this regard, the Soviet Union's attitude is also very clear.

    In the hope of consolidating peace and international security, we support the proposal to consider measures to ease international tensions. Therefore, we believe that the most important thing is that the five-power conference should first consider the need to stop the arms race, to achieve genuine disarmament, and first of all, to disarm the major powers that bear the primary responsibility for defending peace and international security under the United Nations Charter. Disarmament is inseparable from the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The most important and urgent issue for the people of the world is nothing more than disarmament and stopping the arms race. Of course, we are also prepared to discuss other issues whose solution is also dependent on the easing of international tensions.

    In this regard, we cannot ignore the fact that the remarks of Western politicians and the articles in most foreign newspapers avoid mentioning the Soviet proposal that the meeting should discuss measures to ease international tensions. It is clear that this is the result of pressure from those groups who intend to maintain, or even attempt to deepen, international tensions and strive to obstruct the easing of international tensions. However, we believe that this stubborn resistance of the aggressive groups will not only fail to weaken the efforts of those who are striving to consolidate peace, but will also make them more determined to fight for the easing of international relations.

    The Soviet Union's November 3rd note also suggested that the Foreign Ministers of the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union discuss the German question. No one can deny that the solution of the German question is very important for ensuring European security and consolidating peace. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union believes that the discussion of the German question should include the question of German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with a democratic and peace-loving all-German government. This is in the interests of all peace-loving countries in Europe, and without a doubt, it is also in the interests of the German people themselves.

    The U.S., British, and French governments insist on a different position. They refuse to take any practical steps to restore German unity and discuss a peace treaty with Germany. It has been almost two years since the Soviet government put forward the draft principles of a peace treaty with Germany. However, to this day, the U.S., British, and French governments have not expressed their attitude towards the Soviet proposal, nor have they put forward their own draft peace treaty with Germany. Their intention to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which aims to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, as soon as possible through the signing of the Paris and Bonn treaties, proves that the direction of the policy they are pursuing is contrary to the restoration of German unity, let alone ensuring European security.

    If this aggressive policy continues, no one can regard West Germany as a peaceful country, because West Germany will become a tool of a certain imperialist bloc. In this case, the aggressors of the North Atlantic Group may reach some kind of understanding with the aggressors of West Germany for a certain period of time, but the result is always the same, a remilitarized Germany, having completely fallen into the hands of former Hitler party members and other revanchists, will speak in the language of its militarists and will become a dangerous place for launching new aggression – if we are truly concerned about European security, we cannot ignore this fact.

    It is very clear that the policy of reviving German militarism and the intention of making West Germany participate in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc directly threaten the security of the people of France, Poland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and other European countries, and make the people of these countries lose confidence in their tomorrow. Because in this case, European security is unreliable.

    In their note of October 18, the U.S., British, and French governments correctly linked the German question with the European security question. However, the current remilitarization of West Germany is not only incompatible with the security of West Germany's neighbors, but also with ensuring the security of other European countries. Similarly, the ever-expanding network of military bases in Europe and other areas close to the Soviet border and the maintenance of European security are irreconcilable.

    Western newspapers usually avoid talking about the delicate issue of the U.S. establishing military bases in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It seems that we still have not found a reporter who dares to seriously prove that the air and naval bases that the U.S. intends to use to encircle the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the People's Republic of China are for the needs of U.S. national defense. This cannot be proven, and no one will believe it.

    In that case, if we truly want to ensure the security of all European countries, if we strive to ease international tensions, then who can deny the legitimacy of the Soviet Union's demand to discuss this issue (the issue of the U.S. establishing military bases on foreign territory)?

    Of course, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles can say that U.S. military bases in Europe, Asia, and Africa can consolidate collective security. Obviously, "collective security" here does not mean the security of all European countries. Because, the U.S. establishing military bases in some European countries as a "strength" threat is obviously used to deal with other European countries that have not established military bases. This means that Mr. Dulles has no intention of attaching importance to what was said in the U.S. note regarding European security. What he has done is once again praise "strength," taking this as a favorite method of handling international relations. In any case, it is best to remember that this method has completely gone bankrupt in the face of the Soviet Union, and will not bring any good results to those who decide to plan according to this idea.

    Since the three countries' attitude on the German question showed a certain inconsistency, and this issue cannot but be linked to the issue of European security, the Soviet government had to request a clarification. The Soviet government's note on this point said:

    "The Soviet government hopes that the British government and the U.S. and French governments will explain that since they have expressed their willingness to discuss the German question at the Four-Power Conference and recognize the need to guarantee European security, does that mean that they do not intend to both suggest discussing the German question at the meeting and at the same time take measures to require countries that have not yet ratified the Paris and Bonn treaties to ratify these two treaties. Such an explanation is necessary, because if the above-mentioned treaties are ratified and implemented, Germany will no longer be able to be restored as a unified country, and discussing the German question at the Four-Power Conference will lose its meaning, because at that time the meeting will be bound by the obligations agreed upon in advance by the three countries and Adenauer's Bonn government, which is to pull West Germany into the North Atlantic Group and establish a West German revanchist army."

    The Soviet Union is waiting for a clarification on this point.

    Based on everything said above, the question naturally arises: Will the Foreign Ministers' meeting be held? The answer to this question depends first of all on the attitude of the United States, Great Britain, and France, that is, whether they agree to discuss the issue of easing international tensions and the German question and the related issue of guaranteeing European security.

    The urgency of convening a Foreign Ministers' meeting has not diminished at all. However, the meeting should never be limited in advance to discussing any one issue, while excluding the fundamental issue from its agenda – the issue of easing international tensions. Any achievement in the area of easing international tensions, whether related to the East or the West, can be seen as an achievement of peace-loving countries.

    At present, foreign newspapers and magazines are talking a lot about the Bermuda U.S., British, and French Tripartite Conference, although the specific goals and its one-sided nature of this conference cannot solve the problems related to easing international tensions. Such a meeting that pits some countries against others can only lead to the directly opposite result, and even make the international situation even more tense.

    However, there is one interesting point about this meeting. This meeting was held by a few countries in a small group, but it could not be limited to discussing any one issue. This fact once again proves that it is impossible to ignore the main issues of our time – the issue of easing international tensions, consolidating peace, and international security. The attention of millions of people is focused on this issue, and the Soviet Union advocates discussing this issue immediately.

    After issuing the statement, V.M. Molotov answered questions raised by Soviet and foreign journalists.

    Reuters reporter Sid Weiland and Associated Press reporter Lee Casiskem attempted to probe the Soviet Union's attitude toward a summit conference of the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France. They asked: Should a Foreign Ministers' meeting be held before a summit conference of the heads of the four governments?

    V.M. Molotov replied: The issue is not just talking about the meeting. The important thing is to determine the purpose of the meeting.

    From this point of view, the question of the above-mentioned two types of meetings must be studied, because this is not a question of composition, but a political question.

    "Izvestia" reporter V. Kudryavtsev asked: What is your assessment of the prospects for the Korean political conference?

    V.M. Molotov replied: Our impression is that the Korean and Chinese side are doing everything possible to strive for the timely convening of the Korean political conference. However, the convening of the political conference certainly does not depend on one side alone.

    United Press reporter Ken Brooney asked: If everyone believes that it is possible to discuss any international issue at the meeting, then what other issues besides the German issue and the Korean issue might be raised at the meeting?

    V.M. Molotov replied: What I said earlier has already explained that the meeting should not be restricted in advance to discussing only a certain issue. Everyone participating in the meeting can raise any international dispute at this meeting. If the meeting believes that the resolution of a certain issue is helpful to the easing of international tensions, then the meeting can do so without restriction. The Soviet government believes that it is particularly important to discuss issues such as stopping the arms race, resolutely disarming, and prohibiting atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    Other issues can also be raised if discussing these issues is helpful to easing international tensions.

    "Pravda" reporter Yu. Zhukov asked: Western countries often say that the Soviet government's proposal to study measures to ease international tensions can be considered as advocating the simultaneous study of all international disputes. Is this statement correct? Please talk about it in detail.

    V.M. Molotov replied: This statement is of course incorrect. From the Soviet government's proposal to study measures to ease international tensions at the Foreign Ministers' meeting, it absolutely cannot be concluded that all disputes should be studied at the same time.

    This proposal advocates: First, all major powers should participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting without exception; Second, the participants in the meeting must not be constrained in advance by the obligation to only discuss certain international disputes, but should be allowed to jointly agree to study any pressing issues, as long as everyone believes that the resolution of such pressing issues is helpful to the easing of international tensions. Opening the meeting in this way, because it does not restrict the participants in the meeting in advance from only raising certain international issues for discussion, is most helpful to the easing of international tensions.

    莫洛托夫举行记者招待会
    就召开外长会议问题发表声明
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫于十一月十三日举行记者招待会，到会的有苏联新闻界代表及外国驻莫斯科的记者。
    记者招待会开始后，莫洛托夫发表了如下的声明：
    苏联政府在十一月三日以关于召开外长会议问题的照会一件送交英国、美国和法国政府。
    苏联政府在照会中建议召开外长会议，以便：第一，在有美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外交部长参加的会议上审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施；第二，在有美国、英国、法国和苏联的外交部长参加的会议上讨论德国问题和与此有关的保障欧洲安全问题。
    苏联政府的这个照会引起了外国官方人士和各种倾向的报纸的广泛谈论，因为照会提出了一些问题，这些问题的解决对巩固和平与国际安全具有重大的意义。
    苏联政府的建议在许多国家的社会各界中受到欢迎。
    这些建议在美国、英国和法国政府人士和某些报纸中受到了另一种看待。美国总统艾森豪威尔甚至把这个照会说成是“否定的”，他硬说苏联的照会没有表示愿意举行会议。这种说法显然是违反事实的。
    现在，召开外长会议的问题成了世界舆论注意的中心。什么苏联并没有表示愿意举行会议的说法，是不能欺骗那些了解情况的人的。不难看出，情况是完全相反的。我们不妨提一提，就在最近，苏联在八月四日、九月二十八日和十一月三日曾三次向美国、英国和法国政府提出了关于召开外长会议的问题。
    但是，问题并不是只有苏联政府希望召开外长会议，而美国、英国和法国政府不希望召开。谁也不能否认，这四国政府都曾表示过赞成召开外长会议的。但是，在关于这样一个会议目的何在的问题上，它们至今没有取得一致的意见。
    至于苏联在这个问题上的态度，在十一月三日的照会中已经详细说明了。我们的态度是：如果外长会议的目的在于缓和国际紧张局势，这种会议是必要的和有用的。从美国、英国和法国政府所发表的某些声明看来，它们也是赞成缓和国际紧张局势的。但是，很显然，空谈赞成缓和国际紧张局势是一回事，在这方面采取真正的步骤又是另外一回事。
    我们认为，举行这样一个会议是为了要朝着巩固和平与国际安全的方向迈进一步。这应该是研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施以及讨论德国问题（包括恢复德国统一及缔结和约）的目的。解决德国问题是和欧洲的安全密切相关的，因而也是和缓和国际紧张局势密切相关的。
    但是美国、英国和法国政府采取了另一种态度。它们拒绝研究缓和国际紧张局势问题，企图使德国问题的讨论服从于加速德国重新军国主义化的目的，而不是服从于在和平与民主的基础上恢复德国统一的目的。
    你们自己可以判断：走这条路，能够有助于巩固和平与国际安全吗？我们苏联人对这问题的答复是：不可能认为这是朝着巩固和平的方向前进了一步，这样做是不会有助于缓和国际紧张局势的。
    在这种情形之下，为什么建议在流茄诺举行四国外长会议呢？显然，并不是为了当真努力谋求解决迫切的国际问题和缓和国际紧张局势。在关于建议召开流茄诺会议的照会公布以后，美国国务院一位发言人马上表示，即使流茄诺会议召开，会上大家最后是否能取得协议，还大成疑问。这种表示当然并不是偶然的。
    荷兰议会议员葛雷特逊教授最近写了一篇文章，认为美、英、法三国的态度可以认为是企图使关于召开四大国会议的一切商讨得到消极的结果。他说：“完全有理由可以断定，这种失败正是他们的真正目的。”
    当然，一个人完全可以因为不能忽视广泛的国际舆论同情举行四大国会议，而大谈特谈举行四大国会议，实际上却使这些谈话成为毫无价值。苏联完全用另外一种态度来看待这个问题。对苏联来说，会议并不是投机的对象。我们所以关切地希望举行一次解决迫切的国际问题的会议，是因为我们希望缓和国际紧张局势，希望巩固和平与国际安全。
    正是因为这样，苏联过去和现在都建议美、英、法、苏和中华人民共和国在一起讨论缓和国际紧张局势的问题。谁也不能否认，在解决迫切的国际问题时，有中华人民共和国参加是非常重要的。谁也不能在认真地谈到解决迫切的国际问题时，不涉及美国和中华人民共和国的关系。为了彻底地解决朝鲜问题（包括外国军队撤出朝鲜、统一朝鲜问题），其他国家尊重伟大的中华人民共和国这样一个亚洲国家的合法利益，也是很重要的。在同意举行有中国参加的五大国会议这一点上取得协议，这件事情本身就说明已经朝着缓和国际紧张局势及巩固和平的方向前进了一大步。
    艾登先生最近在下院说，东西方紧张关系能否缓和，完全决定于苏联政府。这种说法当然是不能说服人的。“西方”难道不应对它们目前与东方国家的分歧负主要责任吗？在另一方面，事实非常明显，中国参加五大国会议，就是减少西方和东方的分歧的一个重大步骤。
    这一切都说明，如果真正希望解决重大的国际问题，其关键就在于讨论缓和国际紧张局势的问题。
    然而，建议讨论缓和国际紧张局势，并不就是要把东方和西方的一切急待解决的问题立刻一起解决。如果把事情说成这样，那是错误的。没有人能够同意这样一个过分简单的解释，这是歪曲建议原意的。但是，事先使会议受到约束也是不对的，因为会议应该自己决定现在什么决议可以有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    在这方面，苏联的态度也是非常明确的。
    为了希望巩固和平与国际安全，我们支持考虑缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议。因此，我们认为最重要的是：五大国会议首先应该考虑到有必要停止扩军运动，做到真正裁减军备，首先是裁减按照联合国宪章负有保卫和平与国际安全的主要责任的大国的军备。裁减军备是和禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器联系而不可分的。全世界人民最重要、最迫切的问题莫过于裁减军备和停止扩军运动。当然，我们也准备讨论其他的、国际紧张局势的缓和也有赖于其解决的问题。
    在这方面，我们不能忽视一个事实。西方政治家们的言论和外国大部分报纸的文章，都对苏联提出的应在这个会议上讨论缓和国际紧张局势的建议避而不谈。很明显，这是那些有意维持、甚或企图加深国际紧张局势和力求阻挠国际紧张局势缓和的集团使用压力的结果。然而，我们相信，侵略集团的这种顽抗，不但不能削弱争取巩固和平的人们的努力，而且将使他们更坚决地为缓和国际关系而斗争。
    苏联十一月三日的照会也建议美、英、法、苏四国外长会议讨论德国问题。谁也不能否认，德国问题的解决对于保障欧洲安全和巩固和平是非常重要的。正因为如此，苏联才认为在讨论德国问题中应包括德国统一的问题以及和一个民主和爱好和平的全德政府缔结和约的问题。这是符合欧洲所有爱好和平的国家的利益的，毫无疑问，同样也是符合德国人民本身的利益的。
    美、英、法三国政府坚持不同的立场。它们拒绝采取任何实际的步骤来恢复德国的统一和讨论对德和约。自从苏联政府提出对德和约原则草案以来，快要有两年了。然而，直到今天，美、英、法三国政府还没有表示他们对苏联这项建议的态度，也没有提出它们的对德和约草案。它们通过签订巴黎和波恩条约来尽速把西德拖入目的在于反对苏联和各人民民主国家的北大西洋侵略集团，这种意图证明它们所奉行的政策的方针是和恢复德国的统一背道而驰的，更谈不到保障欧洲的安全了。
    如果这种侵略方针继续下去，没有人能把西德当作一个和平国家，因为西德将成为某一个帝国主义国家集团的工具了。在这种情况下，北大西洋集团的侵略分子或许能在一定的时期内和西德的侵略分子达成某种谅解，但结果总是一样，一个重新军国主义化的德国由于彻底落入了以前希特勒党徒和其他报复主义者的手中，就将用其军国主义者的语言来讲话，并将成为发动新侵略的危险场所——如果我们真正关心欧洲的安全，我们就不能忽视这个事实。
    非常清楚，重新复活德国军国主义的政策及使西德参加北大西洋侵略集团的意图，直接威胁着法国、波兰、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、荷兰和其他欧洲国家人民的安全，并且使这些国家的人民对他们的明天失去信心。因为在这种情况下，欧洲的安全是不可靠的。
    美、英、法三国政府在它们十月十八日的照会中正确地将德国问题和欧洲安全问题联系在一起。但是目前正在实行的西德的重新军国主义化，不仅是和西德邻国的安全而且也是和保障其他欧洲国家安全不相容的。同样，美国在欧洲和其他接近苏联边境的地区日益扩大军事基地网和欧洲安全的保持，也是不能调和的。
    西方报纸通常避免谈论美国在欧洲、亚洲和非洲建立军事基地的微妙问题。看来我们仍然没有发现有过那一个记者敢于认真地证明：美国打算用来包围苏联、各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的空军和海军基地是为了美国的国防需要。这一点是无法加以证明的，而且也不会有人相信的。
    既然如此，如果我们真正要保障一切欧洲国家的安全，如果我们力求国际紧张局势的缓和，那末，谁能否认苏联要求讨论这个问题（美国在外国领土上建立军事基地的问题）的正当性呢？
    当然，美国国务卿杜勒斯可以这样说，美国在欧洲、亚洲和非洲的军事基地可以巩固集体安全。显然，这里的“集体安全”决不是意味着一切欧洲国家的安全。因为，美国在某些欧洲国家建立军事基地，以作为一种“实力”威胁，显然是用来对付那些并没有建立军事基地的其他欧洲国家的。这意味着，杜勒斯先生无意重视美国照会中所谈的关于欧洲安全的话。他所做的就是再一次歌颂“实力”，把这当作处理国际关系的喜爱的方法。无论如何，最好记着，这种方法在苏联面前已经完全破产，而且对于那些根据这种想法而决定计划的人们不会带来什么好结果的。
    既然三国在德国问题上的态度显示了一定的不一致，而且这个问题又不能不和欧洲的安全问题联系起来，苏联政府便不得不要求得到一个澄清。苏联政府照会中关于这一点是这样说的：
      “苏联政府希望英国政府以及美、法两国政府说明，它们既经表示愿意在四大国会议上讨论德国问题，并承认保障欧洲安全的必要，那是否就是说它们不打算既建议在会议上讨论德国问题而同时又采取措施，要求尚未批准巴黎和波恩条约的国家批准这两个条约。这样一种说明是必要的，因为上述条约若获得批准并付诸实行，德国就再也不可能恢复为一个统一的国家，在四国会议上讨论德国问题也就失去了意义，因为那时会议将受到三国和阿登纳的波恩政府事前就约定了的义务的束缚，这种义务就是把西德拉进北大西洋集团，并成立一支西德复仇主义的军队。”
    苏联等待着对这一点的澄清。
    根据以上所说的一切，自然产生了这个问题：外长会议是否会举行呢？这个问题的答复首先要看美国、英国和法国的态度，也就是说要看它们是否同意讨论缓和国际紧张局势问题以及德国问题和与此有关的保障欧洲安全的问题。
    召开外长会议的迫切性决没有减少。可是，决不应事先使会议局限于讨论任何一个问题，而从其议程中排除了基本的问题——缓和国际紧张局势的问题。在缓和国际紧张局势这一方面的任何成就，无论是关系到东方或是西方，都可以看做是爱好和平的国家的成就。
    目前，外国报章杂志对于百慕大美、英、法三国会议谈得很多，虽然这个会议的特定目标和它的片面性质决不能解决和缓和国际紧张局势有关的问题。这样一种使某些国家和另一些国家对立的会议，只能引起直接相反的结果，甚至使国际局势更加紧张。
    可是，这个会议有一点是颇有意思的。这个会议是一个狭小的集团的几个国家所举行的，可是它也不能仅限于讨论任何一个问题。这件事实再一次证明了：目前要对我们时代的主要问题——缓和国际紧张局势、巩固和平和国际安全的问题置之不理，那是不可能的。千百万人民的注意力正是集中在这个问题上，苏联主张立即讨论这个问题。
    维·米·莫洛托夫在发表声明后，答复了苏联和外国记者所提出的问题。
    路透社记者悉·韦兰德和美联社记者里·卡西斯奇克姆企图试探苏联对苏、美、英、法四国首长会议的态度。他们问：在四国政府首长会议以前，是不是应该召开外长会议？
    维·米·莫洛托夫答：问题并不在于仅仅谈论会议。重要的是确定会议的目的。
    从这种观点看来，关于上述两种会议的问题是必须予以研究的，因为这不是一个组成问题，而是一个政治问题。
   “消息报”记者弗·库德里雅夫采夫问：您对朝鲜政治会议的前途怎样估计？
    维·米·莫洛托夫答：我们的印象是，朝中方面正在尽一切可能，争取及时召开朝鲜政治会议。然而，政治会议的召开当然不是仅仅取决于一方面的。
    合众社记者肯·布罗尼问：如果大家认为有可能在会议上讨论任何国际问题的话，那末除了德国问题和朝鲜问题外，还有什么别的问题可能在会议上提出呢？
    维·米·莫洛托夫答：我前面说的话已经说明，不应该事先限制会议只讨论某种问题。每个参加会议的人都可以在这个会议上提出任何国际争执问题。如果会议认为，某一问题的解决有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，那末会议就可以不受限制地这样做。苏联政府认为特别重要的是讨论停止扩充军备、坚决裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器等问题。
    也还可以提出其他一些问题，如果讨论这些问题是有助于缓和国际紧张局势的话。
    “真理报”记者尤·茹科夫问：西方国家往往说，苏联政府主张研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议，可以认为是主张同时研究一切国际争执问题。这种说法对不对？请详细谈谈。
    维·米·莫洛托夫答：这种说法当然是不对的。从苏联政府主张在外长会议上研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议中绝不能得出这样结论，认为一切争执问题应同时研究。
    这个建议主张的是：第一，一切大国应无例外地参加外长会议；第二，不得事先以只准讨论某种国际争执问题的义务来约束会议参加者，而要使他们可以共同协议来研究任何迫切的问题，只要大家认为这种迫切问题的解决有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。会议的这种开法，由于不事先限制会议参加者只准提出某种国际问题来讨论，所以对国际紧张局势的缓和最有帮助。
