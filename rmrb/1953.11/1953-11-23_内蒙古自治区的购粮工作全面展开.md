Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, November 22nd: The grain purchase work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been fully unfolded. This year, most areas of Inner Mongolia have experienced a bumper harvest, and farmers have a large surplus of grain to sell to the state. In early October, farmers were both threshing and transporting new grain to the market for sale, and the amount of grain entering the market increased day by day. Currently, according to statistics from cities such as Tongliao and Ulanhot, where grain is concentrated, the number of grain carts entering the market daily has increased from one or two hundred in the past to six or seven hundred. By November 8th, the amount of grain purchased and stored by the grain departments had increased sevenfold compared to early October.

In order to do a good job in this year's grain purchase work and strive to over fulfill the state's grain purchase plan, the Communist Party committees and government departments at all levels in Inner Mongolia attach great importance to the grain purchase work. In September, they convened various meetings one after another to arrange the grain purchase work, and then mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to publicize the state's grain purchase policies and the significance of grain purchase to the farmers, and to help district and village cadres carry out the grain purchase work. Leading cadres of the CPC Inner Mongolia Eastern District Committee and the Eastern Administrative Office also went to the countryside to personally go deep into the rural areas to lead and inspect the grain purchase work. The grain departments and cooperatives have also conducted policy education for grain purchase cadres, and have run training classes for quality inspection personnel to unify the standards for quality inspection. In order to achieve "superior quality, superior price," some grain purchasing stations also displayed samples of various grain grades, and determined the grades based on the samples during the purchase, which satisfied the farmers.

Inner Mongolia is a vast area. In order to make it convenient for farmers in remote areas to sell grain, the grain departments have added more than ten purchasing stations in these areas. The grassroots units of the cooperatives have also set up many temporary purchasing points, or organized mobile purchasing teams to take the goods needed by the farmers to these areas to purchase and supply at the same time.

State-owned trade and cooperatives have also made full preparations in terms of supply to cooperate with the grain purchase work. Before the grain purchase work began, they all checked and revised the supply plan for the fourth quarter. For example, the supply volume of state-owned department stores was expanded by 35% compared with the original plan; the supply volume of the Inner Mongolia Supply and Marketing Cooperative was expanded by 20% compared with the original plan, and the variety of goods was doubled compared with the original plan. After the farmers sell grain, they can buy a large number of high-quality and inexpensive means of livelihood and means of production, improve their lives, and lay a good foundation for next year's production.

    内蒙古自治区的购粮工作全面展开
    【新华社归绥二十二日电】内蒙古自治区的购粮工作已经全面展开。今年，内蒙古全区大部分地区都是丰收，农民有大批的余粮卖给国家。在十月初旬，农民们即一面打场，一面将新粮运到市场上出售，上市粮食一天比一天增加。目前，据粮食集中较多的通辽和乌兰浩特等城市统计，每天上市的粮车已由过去的一二百辆增加到六七百辆，到十一月八日止，粮食部门收购入库的粮食，已比十月初旬增加了七倍。
    为了做好今年的购粮工作，争取超额完成国家的购粮计划，中共内蒙古各级党委和政府部门，对购粮工作都十分重视。在九月间即先后召开了各种会议，布置购粮工作，随即又动员大批干部下乡，向农民宣传国家购粮的政策及购粮的意义，并帮助区村干部进行购粮工作。中共内蒙古东部区党委会和东部行政公署的领导干部也大部下乡，亲自深入农村领导和检查购粮工作。粮食部门和合作社又对购粮干部进行了政策教育，并开办了检验质量人员训练班，统一了检验质量的标准。为了做到“优等优价”，有的粮食收购站还将各种粮食等级的样品陈列出来，在收购时根据样品确定等级，使农民感到满意。
    内蒙古地区辽阔，为了使边远地方的农民出售粮食方便，粮食部门除在这些地区增设了十多处收购站外，合作社各基层单位又设立了许多临时性的收购点，或组织流动收购小组带着农民需要的货物到这些地区去，一面收购，一面供应。
    国营贸易和合作社为配合购粮工作，在供应方面也作了充分准备。在购粮工作开始前，都检查和修订了第四季度的供应计划。如国营百货公司的供应额比原计划扩大了百分之三十五；内蒙古供销合作社的供应额比原计划扩大了百分之二十，货物的品种也比原计划增加了一倍。农民出售粮食后，可以买到大批物美价廉的生活资料和生产资料，改善了生活，并给明年的生产打下了良好基础。
