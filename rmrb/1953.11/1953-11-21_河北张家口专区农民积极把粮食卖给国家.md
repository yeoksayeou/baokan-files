Farmers in Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, Actively Sell Grain to the State

[This newspaper report] Farmers in Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, are actively selling grain to the state to support the country's economic construction. At the same time, they are purchasing large quantities of means of production to prepare for next year's large-scale production. The grain sold by farmers in the entire special district to the state in September exceeded the state's procurement plan by more than two times, and in October exceeded the state's procurement plan by 16.98 percent. The amount of grain on the market is still increasing daily.

Why do farmers sell grain to the state? Chen Bai, a farmer from Dongbali Township in Huailai County, answered this question. He said: "In the past, when we suffered disasters, the People's Government transferred a large amount of grain from other places to supply us. This year we have a bumper harvest, so we should sell the surplus grain to the state. Only when the state controls enough grain can it do a good job in national construction, guarantee price stability, and make our lives as farmers better and better." He has already sold 950 jin of grain to the state. Ren Guolin, a farmer from Xinzhuangzi Village in the county, thought about how this year's harvest was so good because the state supplied farmers with waterwheels, insecticide powder... and supported farmers' production. He also thought about how the cloth, kerosene, and matches needed daily were all made in factories. Without supporting industrial construction, we would not be able to obtain more and better goods. Through such recollections, he understood that workers and peasants must support each other, so he sold all forty shi of wheat he had stored to the state.

In the process of selling grain, Party members and Youth League members in various places have played an exemplary role. The Xiaodongzhuang branch of the Communist Party of China in Xuanhua County conducted patriotic grain sales education for farmers before the autumn grain harvest by using methods such as recalling, comparing, and carefully calculating accounts. As a result, out of 99 households in the village, 90 households signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to pre-sell 242,800 jin of grain. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various places are even more actively selling surplus grain to the state. The Gao Jinshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiazhuang Township, Xuanhua County, has sold more than 38,000 jin of grain to the state and plans to sell another 110,000 jin.

Party committees and financial departments at all levels have strengthened their leadership in the work of procuring grain. The Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly convened a meeting of responsible Party cadres from relevant departments, emphasizing that to do a good job in procuring grain, it is necessary to strengthen political work and use various methods to publicize to farmers the reasons for selling grain to the state.

### 河北张家口专区农民积极把粮食卖给国家

    河北张家口专区农民积极把粮食卖给国家
   【本报讯】河北省张家口专区的农民，积极卖粮食给国家，支持国家的经济建设；同时购入大批生产资料，准备明年的大生产。全专区农民九月份卖给国家的粮食，超过国家收购计划两倍以上，十月份超过国家收购计划百分之十六点九八，现在粮食上市量仍在逐日上升。
    农民为什么要把粮食卖给国家呢？怀来县东八里乡农民陈柏回答了这个问题。他说：“过去咱们遭了灾，人民政府就从别的地方调来大批粮食供应咱们；今年咱们丰收了，就应把余粮卖给国家。只有国家掌握了足够的粮食，才能搞好国家建设，才能保证物价稳定，才能使咱们庄稼人的日子越过越好。”他已经卖给国家九百五十斤粮食。该县辛庄子村农民任国麟，从今年庄稼丰收，想到国家若不供给农民水车、杀虫药粉……支援农民生产，今年的庄稼就不会有这样好的收成。再想到日常需要的布匹、煤油、火柴都是工厂里制造的，不支持工业建设，就不能得到更多更好的用品。通过这样回忆，他明白了工人和农民必须相互支援，于是把自己存着的四十石小麦全部卖给国家。
    在卖粮当中，各地党员、团员发挥了模范作用。中共宣化县小东庄支部，在秋粮收打前就用回忆、对比和算细账等方式，向农民进行了爱国售粮的教育。结果，全村九十九户，就有九十户和供销合作社订立了预售二十四万二千八百斤粮食的合同。各地农业生产合作社和互助组，更积极把余粮卖给国家。宣化县宋家庄乡高锦山农业生产合作社，已卖给国家三万八千多斤粮食，还准备再卖十一万斤。
    各级党委和政府财经部门都加强了关于收购粮食工作的领导。中共张家口地委及时召开了有关部门负责党员干部会议，强调要把收购粮食工作作好，必须加强政治工作，用各种办法向农民宣传把粮食卖给国家的道理。
