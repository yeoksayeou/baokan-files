    Pay Attention to Safe Production
    In some factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction units, production accidents and personal injuries have not decreased but have increased during the production increase and economy campaign. In the last ten days of September, the Northeast Benxi Engineering Company had 32 accidents; in the first half of October, the Jiangsu Jiawang Coal Mine had three major accidents in a row; the Anshan Iron and Steel Company had the best month for safe production in August, with a decrease in minor injuries and the elimination of serious injuries and deaths, but three major accidents occurred in September.
    The reason why casualties and accidents have increased since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign is that the leading cadres of some enterprises have put production increase and economy in opposition to safe production. Some comrades have said, "Accidents are minor matters, failing to complete the production increase and economy plan is a major matter," and "Now that production increase and economy are the focus, there is no way to take care of safety." Therefore, they neglect safety production education for workers, neglect to improve safety equipment that needs to be improved and can be improved, and take some rush methods in the production increase and economy campaign, so accidents increase.
    Safe production is a policy that all our industrial and mining enterprises and construction engineering units must abide by. It should be seriously implemented in the production increase and economy campaign to ensure the realization of the production plan and the production increase and economy plan. Otherwise, not only will the goal of increasing production and practicing economy not be achieved, but greater losses will be caused. For example, at the No. 1 Well of the Southwest State-owned 401 Coal Mine, the deputy chief of the well unilaterally emphasized economy and demanded that workers recover all the coal under the support pillars of the working face, resulting in a roof collapse accident on a new coal mining working face, killing one worker and preventing production on this working face for six consecutive days. This example fully demonstrates that safe production and production increase and economy are inseparable.
    In order to achieve safe production in the production increase and economy campaign, in addition to educating workers on safe production, enterprise cadres must more importantly implement the policy of combining the production increase and economy campaign with the improvement of enterprise management, organize balanced production, and avoid and prevent rushing phenomena; at the same time, they must implement safety operating technical regulations to prevent various accidents.

### 注意安全生产

    注意安全生产
    部分厂矿企业和基本建设施工部门，在增产节约运动中，生产事故和人身事故不但没有减少，反而增加了。东北本溪工程公司在九月下旬的十天中，发生了事故三十二次；江苏贾汪煤矿在十月上半月一连发生了三件重大事故；鞍山钢铁公司八月份轻伤事故减少了，并消灭了重伤、死亡事故，是安全生产最好的月份，但是九月份却发生三次重大事故。
    增产节约运动开展后伤亡事故反而增多的原因，是因为有些企业的领导干部把增产节约和安全生产对立起来。如有的同志说：“出事故是小事，完不成增产节约计划是大事”，“现在既然以增产节约为中心，就没法顾到安全”。因此，他们就忽视对工人进行安全生产的教育，忽视改善那些必需改善并可能改善的安全设备，加上在增产节约运动中采取了某些突击的办法，因此，事故便增加起来。
    安全生产是我们所有工矿企业及建设工程单位必须遵守的方针，在增产节约运动中更应认真贯彻，才能保证生产计划和增产节约计划的实现。不这样，不仅达不到增产节约的目的，反而会造成更大的损失。如西南国营四零一煤矿一井，因副井长片面强调节约，要求工人把工作面支柱下的煤全部收回，造成一个新采煤工作面的冒顶事故，死一个工人，并使这个工作面一连六天不能生产。这个例子，充分说明了安全生产与增产节约是不可分割的。
    为了做到在增产节约运动中安全生产，企业干部除了对工人进行安全生产的教育外，更重要的是贯彻增产节约运动必须和改善企业管理工作相结合的方针，组织均衡生产，避免和防止突击现象；同时要贯彻安全操作技术规程，防止各种事故的发生。
