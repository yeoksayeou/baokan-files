    The "Promise" That No One Is Responsible For
    Xiāo Yǔ

    When Malaya's rubber industry "is suffering from the most serious depression since the early 1930s" (according to Agence France-Presse), the U.S. government and Malayan rubber industrialists are engaged in an apparently endless quarrel.

    According to a United Press International dispatch from Kuala Lumpur on October 16, a spokesman for the Malayan natural rubber industry said that the U.S. government had made a promise to them, agreeing to help the development of the Malayan natural rubber industry by buying as much natural rubber as the U.S. could use, and saying that they would never use U.S. synthetic rubber to exclude them. However, according to this spokesman, the fact proves that the U.S. government is not sincere at all, and its promise is completely deceptive. "Even though the price of Malayan natural rubber (per pound) is nine Malayan cents cheaper than synthetic rubber, and Malayan natural rubber is more popular than synthetic rubber, it still cannot be sold entirely in the United States." He said that the U.S. government is now lowering the selling price of synthetic rubber to squeeze out their natural rubber, and the U.S. government is also forcing U.S. consumers to buy synthetic rubber.

    After listening to the Malayan rubber industry spokesman's accusations, an official of the U.S. government immediately came out to deny it. He said that the promise was made by private representatives of the U.S. rubber consuming industry and had nothing to do with the U.S. government. If responsibility is to be pursued, it can only be pursued from the representatives of the seven or eight hundred companies in the U.S. that use rubber.

    This U.S. official's statement that American capitalists cannot represent the U.S. government is something that anyone with a little common sense would not believe. Who doesn't know that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is a director of U.S. International Nickel Company and U.S. Banknote Corporation, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson is the general manager of U.S. General Motors, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey is the chairman of Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company? Which of these American capitalists wearing ministerial uniforms does not represent both the U.S. government and the American capitalists? Obviously, the words of this U.S. official are just a shameless sophistry to evade responsibility.

    The "market morality" of the United States has not only been experienced by the rubber owners of Malaya, but also by the merchants of Latin America. Listen to their voices! The Chileans say: When copper prices rose, the United States cut the maximum price it stipulated for the purchase of foreign copper by twenty-seven cents per pound; when copper prices fell, the United States wanted Chile to sell it at market prices. Bolivians also say that their tin transactions with the United States are also conducted in this way: when market prices rise, the United States stipulates price limits; when prices tend to fall, the United States advocates free trade.

    Now, this spokesman for the Malayan natural rubber industry should understand that it is indeed a bit foolish to continue to be enthusiastic about the so-called "promise" of the United States.

    无人负责的“诺言”萧羽
    当马来亚的橡胶业“正遭受到一九三○年年初以来最严重的不景气的袭击”（法新社语）时，美国政府和马来亚橡胶业者发生了一场似乎是没有结局的争吵。
    据合众社吉隆坡十月十六日的电讯报道，马来亚的一个天然橡胶业发言人说，美国政府曾对他们作过一个诺言，答应以美国能用多少天然橡胶就购买多少的办法，来帮助马来亚天然橡胶业的发展，并说绝不用美国的人造橡胶来排斥他们。但是，据这个发言人说，事实证明美国政府是并没任何诚意的，它的诺言完全是欺骗。“尽管马来亚天然橡胶（每磅）售价要比人造橡胶便宜马来亚币九分，而且马来亚的天然橡胶比人造橡胶更受欢迎，但它在美国还是不能全部出售”。他说，美国政府现在正在压低人造橡胶的卖价，来排挤他们的天然橡胶，而且美国政府还逼着美国的消费者购买人造橡胶。
    听了马来亚橡胶业发言人的责难以后，美国政府的一个官员马上出来抵赖了。他说，这个诺言是由美国橡胶消费工业的私人代表作出的，与美国政府没有关系，如果要追究责任的话，只能向美国用橡胶的七百家到八百家公司的代表去追究。
    美国这位官员说美国的资本家并不能代表美国政府，这是稍有一点常识的人都不会相信的。谁不知道美国的国务卿杜勒斯就是美国国际镍公司和美国钞票公司的理事，美国的国防部长威尔逊就是美国通用汽车公司的总经理，美国的财政部长汉弗莱就是美国匹兹堡固本煤炭公司的董事长？这一些穿着部长制服的美国资本家们，他们哪一个不是又代表美国政府，又代表美国资本家的呢？很显然，这位美国官员的话只是一种推卸责任的无耻的狡辩而已。
    美国的“市场道德”不仅为马来亚的橡胶业主们领教了，而且也为拉丁美洲的商人们领教了。请听一听他们的声音吧！智利人说：当铜价上涨时，美国把规定收购外国铜的每磅最高价格削减了两角七分；当铜价下跌时，美国又要智利按市场价格卖给他。玻利维亚人也说，他们与美国的锡交易也是这样进行的：在市场价格上涨时，美国规定限价；而在价格有下跌的趋势时，美国又主张自由买卖了。
    现在，这个马来亚天然橡胶业的发言人总该明白了，如果再热衷于美国的所谓“诺言”，的确有点愚蠢了。
