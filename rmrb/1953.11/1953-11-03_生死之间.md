    Between Life and Death
    By Our Reporter Hu Jin

    “Returning to the motherland means fighting for one's life!” said Ni Xiaomao, a returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) prisoner of war, as he took a deep breath of relief upon returning to the embrace of the motherland.

    This perfectly captures the current situation of our CPVA POWs who have suffered prolonged torment.

    Even though our CPVA POWs have been transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), and even though they have been acknowledged as having "complete freedom to return home and live in peace," their struggle for freedom to return home, from behind the barbed wire of the camp to the explanation tents, remains a life-and-death battle.

    One warm early winter morning, I met Wang Xianzhang, a returned CPVA POW, on a hill in a hospital in Kaesong. He had been repatriated after risking his life to crawl out of the barbed wire fence during the five-day suspension of the explanation work caused by the sabotage of U.S. special agents.

    He was transferred from the murderous U.S. "hospital" on Jeju Island to the "hospital," which was actually the command post for U.S. special agents in the Tongjang-ni POW camp, specifically Camp No. 44. Before he escaped by climbing the barbed wire, he was hung up and beaten all night by the special agents in the so-called "hospital," and was sentenced to death, with a pit dug in preparation for burying him alive.

    As soon as Wang Xianzhang saw the reporter, he said warmly, "I am doing very well now." The welts from the beatings had mostly subsided, but his waist and chest still ached faintly when he walked, and the long, deep wound on his left hand, cut by the barbed wire, was still bandaged.

    He then indignantly recounted his ordeal under torture and the various bloody atrocities in the U.S. "hospital," talking for more than three hours without realizing it.

    On the morning of October 20th, in the U.S. "hospital," Wang Xiang, a CPVA POW who lived in the bed next to Wang Xianzhang, escaped by climbing the barbed wire. Because the two had a good relationship and often exchanged soup and food when they were sick, Wang Xianzhang was immediately stripped naked by the special agents, tied up, and forced to confess to "conspiring to escape" with Wang Xiang, and to reveal the so-called "organization." He refused to confess. As soon as it got dark, Wang Xianzhang was hung from the crossbeam of the tent with his hands tied behind his back. Special agents and "security guards" checked their watches, hitting him twice across the waist every five minutes, and pouring a bowl of cold water on his chest and back every ten minutes. They also poured chili water into his nostrils and used a fire extinguisher to spray cold water into his anus, forcing him to confess. Wang Xianzhang refused to confess and was continuously hung up and beaten. This went on twice every two hours, for a total of three times. Wang Xianzhang's mouth and nose bled, staining his clothes and pants with blood, which also flowed all over the ground. After the last beating, it was almost dawn, and the special agents used a shiny knife, about one foot long and three or four centimeters wide, brought in by their Taiwanese special agent "teacher" Ma, to threaten him by holding it to his neck. In the morning, the special agents gathered all the POWs and announced that Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang had "conspired to escape" and would be buried alive that night.

    The torture endured by Wang Xianzhang powerfully tells the world's fair-minded public opinion that because his fellow prisoner Wang Xiang risked his life to win the freedom to return home, Wang Xianzhang was subjected to extreme torture by U.S. special agents under the charge of "conspiring to escape," and was even to be buried alive. In this situation, what possibility is there for our CPVA POWs to exercise their right to be repatriated?

    Wang Xianzhang, pushed to the brink of death, used his will to survive to expose the bloody hands of the American murderers hidden under the tattered cloak of so-called "voluntary repatriation." He knew that it was almost impossible for him to escape the special agents' trap; but he wanted to live, and he decided to escape. He made this determination between life and death: "If I can escape, it's mine; if I can't, it's yours (the special agents')!"

    Therefore, Wang Xianzhang repeatedly requested to go out to urinate, even though he didn't know if he could escape this way. But just as he reached the toilet, two insane POWs in the adjacent camp were fighting, and a female "nurse" was also quarreling with someone else. The four "security guards" guarding him had their attention diverted and relaxed their surveillance. Wang Xianzhang could hardly believe it was true; the desire to live suddenly ignited an infinite strength. He immediately grabbed the barbed wire and fled. After he was discovered by the "security guards," one of them climbed over the first layer of barbed wire to chase him, hitting him on the foot with a club. But Wang Xianzhang finally escaped. When he climbed over the fourth layer of barbed wire and was helped up by Indian soldiers, he was completely unable to move. However, a loud voice rang in his heart at this moment: "I can finally return to the embrace of the motherland."

              ×    ×    ×

    Another morning, the reporter visited Yue Heidan, another returned CPVA POW. His repatriation exposed another fact of the U.S.'s shameful political and moral failure to the whole world.

    On October 17th, during the explanation work, Yue Heidan entered the explanation tent. Because he could not quickly eliminate the effects of the special agents' bloody persecution, and was also subjected to the terror threats inside and outside the tent at the time, he stayed for three hours without quickly applying for repatriation. The Goebbels-style U.S. propagandists then greatly distorted the facts, insisting that Yue Heidan wanted to "return to Taiwan"; Hamblen even protested, clamoring that this explanation to Yue Heidan was "extremely cruel and extremely punitive." However, Yue Heidan finally achieved victory in a fierce struggle against the threat of death. This victory dealt Hamblen a powerful blow.

    Yue Heidan vividly told the reporter about his thoughts during the three hours he stayed in the tent.

    When he heard that his Camp No. 33 was going to be explained to, he was full of hope, thinking that he could really return home safely this time. Ni Xiaomao, who had often talked with him in the Jeju Island POW camp about how to escape, came over and wrote the character "回" (return) in his palm. He touched Ni with his hand, expressing his knowing joy, and told him to be careful not to show it. However, Yue Heidan had very serious fears and doubts about whether he could return home safely.

    He had suffered the torment of U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the Jeju Island POW camp. His whole body and both hands were tattooed with many reactionary slogans and words. Before being handed over to the neutral countries, he was forced to swear oaths, write blood letters, and establish "joint responsibility guarantees." This caused Yue Heidan's self-esteem and dignity to suffer unbearable damage. At the same time, he saw a map of the neutral zone issued by the special agents, which showed the neutral zone surrounded on three sides by four reinforced divisions and one armored regiment of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee group's armed forces, as well as 1,500 military police, and the muzzles of two U.S. tank regiments pointed at the neutral zone, with only a small opening on the Korean-Chinese side. Yue Heidan thought, how can I return home this way?

    After Yue Heidan arrived at the neutral zone camp, ah! It was still the world of special agents, and even more terrifying. Many more "security guards" were added to the camp. There were more than ten "security guards" around each ring of barbed wire. The special agents forbade the POWs from listening to the radio. Yue Heidan knew nothing about the "scope of authority" and "detailed rules for explanation and visiting work" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Every day, he was forced to participate in practicing "returning to Taiwan" and other methods of disrupting explanations, given diagrams of the explanation tents, told not to go through the repatriation door, and threatened that even if they walked out of this door they would not survive. If one of the five neutral nations didn't approve, it would be ineffective, and they would return to the camp to be smashed to death. When listening to explanations, twenty-five people had to listen to commands together, monitoring each other front and back. If one person wavered, they would grab him and smash him to death. If one person couldn't be caught, everyone would catch him. If they caught him, they would execute him. At night, many POWs talked in their sleep about wanting to go home, and were dragged out and beaten severely, with screams that never stopped, it was simply a world of ghosts and monsters.

    After Yue Heidan entered the explanation tent, he was immediately submerged in the terrifying atmosphere inside and outside the tent, and his mind was buzzing. He was afraid that someone would grab him, so he dared not go through the repatriation door. He could only recite "return to Taiwan" several times, constantly look at the back door, and constantly wipe away sweat. He said that he could not feel at ease unless he looked around all the time. When the explanation representative repeatedly explained to him, he repeatedly nodded; but he was still afraid, and had to repeatedly shake his head again. The U.S. "observer representative" and "translator" then took the opportunity to disrupt the explanation, repeatedly interrupting it. The special agents outside the tent also shouted loudly, creating an extremely terrifying atmosphere, making it impossible for him to make a decision. He had to drag on, waiting for a safe opportunity. He dragged on until the end, when most of the other explanation tents had finished explaining, and the outside had quieted down. The arrogant arrogance of the U.S. "representatives" in the tent had been suppressed by our side. When he looked out from the repatriation door, he could see many of our representatives. At this time, Yue Heidan became bolder, believing that it was safe to go through the repatriation door. Therefore, he loudly said, "I want to return home!" Timaia then took him from the repatriation door to the Indian army headquarters.

    Let the U.S. propagandists babble about how Yue Heidan was originally firmly opposed to returning home; when Yue Heidan talked about the situation after he arrived at the Indian side, a smile immediately appeared on his face, which was equivalent to giving a contemptuous answer to these nonsense. As soon as Yue Heidan arrived at headquarters, he asked the Indians to reply to him whether they could send him back home immediately, and the Indians agreed. Later, he arrived at the isolation tent, saw daily necessities from the motherland such as toothpaste and toothbrushes, and also saw two North Korean People's Army POWs who had escaped by climbing the barbed wire, who even gave him a pack of cigarettes. Yue Heidan was completely relieved; he could return home safely.

    What does this explain? Isn't the "extremely cruel and extremely punitive" mentioned by Hamblen the most appropriate way to expose the cruelty of the U.S. special agents' persecution of our CPVA POWs? Yue Heidan's experience proves that the U.S. special agents' terror control is like hundreds of poisonous snakes entangling every one of our CPVA POWs, and even inside and outside the explanation tent, this control is still maintained, making it impossible for our CPVA POWs to quickly eliminate the threat of death, quickly regain courage, and still feel that it is almost impossible to move an inch to walk out of the repatriation door that is open just a few feet away in front of them.

    The fact that Wang Xianzhang, Yue Heidan, and other returnees have been freed from the threat of death fully explains why the explanation work cannot proceed smoothly and why it cannot guarantee that our CPVA POWs have complete freedom to return home and live in peace.

    When Wang Xianzhang was parting with the reporter, he excitedly told the reporter that the CPVA POWs who were still in the camp had unspeakable pain in their hearts, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to escape, and they dared not even hum a sound. He demanded that they must be rescued.

    This is the appeal of justice and righteousness. As long as this pain of our CPVA POWs exists for one day, human dignity will suffer humiliation for one day.

    生死之间
    本报记者 胡今
    志愿军被俘人员倪小毛一回到祖国的怀抱，就深长地松了一口气说：“回祖国就是拚命！”
    这完全道破了我方被俘人员遭受长期磨折后目前所处的境遇。
    尽管我方被俘人员已被移交给了中立国遣返委员会看管，尽管他们已被承认“有回家过和平生活的完全自由”；但是，在铁丝网围着的营场里，一直到解释帐篷，他们争取回家的自由，都是一场生与死的搏斗。
    初冬温暖的一天早晨，我在开城一个医院的山岗上，会见了归来的志愿军被俘人员王宪章。他是在美方特务破坏解释工作、使解释工作停顿了五天的时候，带着满身棒伤冒死爬出铁丝网而被遣返回来的。
    他是从济州岛的美方杀人“医院”，被移送住在东场里战俘营里的美方特务总指挥站的“医院”第四十四号营场的。在他爬铁丝网逃走之前，被所谓“医院”里的特务吊打了一晚，并被宣布了死刑，挖好了准备活埋他的土坑。
    王宪章一看到记者就亲切地说：“我现在很好了。”他受的棒伤已大部消退，只是走起路来腰和胸部还隐隐作痛，左手被铁丝网割破的深长的伤口还包着纱布。
    他接着愤激地叙述了他遭受酷刑的经过，和美方“医院”里的种种血腥暴行，不觉谈了三个多钟头。
    十月二十日清早，在美方“医院”里，住在王宪章邻病床的志愿军被俘人员王祥爬铁丝网逃走了。由于他们两人平时感情较好，病中常常互送汤食，王宪章当即被特务剥光衣服，捆绑起来，硬要他承认与王祥“串谋逃跑”，并招出所谓“组织”来。他不承认。天刚黑，王宪章就被反翦着双手吊在帐篷的横梁上。特务和“警备队员”对着手表，每五分钟拦腰打他两棒子，每十分钟在他前胸后背各泼一碗冷水，还拿辣椒水从鼻孔里灌他，用灭火器往他肛门里打冷水，迫他承认。王宪章不承认，就被继续吊打。这样，两小时吊打一次，一共被吊打了三次。王宪章口鼻冒血，鲜血染满了衣服和裤子，还流了满地。最后一次吊打后，天已快亮，特务用它们的台湾特务马“老师”带进来的一把长约一市尺、宽三、四公分的亮刀，按在王宪章的脖子上来威胁他。到了早晨时分，特务就召集全体战俘，宣布王宪章和王祥“串谋逃跑”，要到晚上活埋他。
    王宪章遭到的这种酷刑，有力地告诉世界的正直舆论：由于他的难友王祥冒着生命危险挣得了回家的自由，他就被美方特务以“串谋逃跑”的罪名受尽酷刑，甚至要被活埋；这样，我方被俘人员还有什么行使被遣返权利的可言呢？
    被推到死亡边缘的王宪章，用求生的勇气揭发了美国杀人犯在所谓“自愿遣返”的破烂外衣掩盖下的两只血手。他知道他要逃出特务的天罗地网几乎是不可能的；但他要活命，他决定逃跑。他在生与死之间下了这个决心：“跑得了是我的，跑不了算你（特务）的！”
    于是，王宪章再三要求让他出去小便，虽然他不知道这样出去能不能逃得了。但正当他到了厕所时，隔邻营场两个疯了的战俘在打架，又有一个女“护士”和别人打闹，四个押他的“警备队员”转移了注意力，放松了对他的监视。王宪章几乎不相信这是不是事实，生的欲望突然燃起了无限的力量，他马上一手攀上铁丝网就逃。他被“警备队员”发觉后，一个“警备队员”就翻过第一层铁丝网追他，还在他脚上打了一棒子，但王宪章终于逃出来了，当他翻过第四层铁丝网被印度士兵扶起时已全身动弹不得了。可是，这时他心里响起了洪亮的声音：“我到底可以回到祖国的怀抱了。”
              ×    ×    ×
    又一个早晨，记者访问了另一个归来的志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦。他的被遣返，向全世界揭露了美方在政治上和道义上的可耻失败的另一事实。
    十月十七日，解释工作进行时，岳黑旦进入解释帐篷后，由于未能很快消除特务血腥迫害的影响，又受到当时帐篷内外的恐怖威胁，他呆了三小时，没有很快申请遣返。戈培尔式的美方宣传家们便大肆歪曲事实，硬说岳黑旦是要“回台湾”的；汉布伦还提出抗议，叫嚣什么这次对岳黑旦的解释是“非常残酷的和非常的惩罚”。但是，岳黑旦在一场与死亡威胁的尖锐斗争中终于得到了胜利。这个胜利给了汉布伦一个有力的打击。
    岳黑旦生动地对记者谈了他呆了三小时的思想情况。
    当他听说他的三十三号营场要听解释时，他满怀希望，以为这回真能安全回国了。曾和他在济州岛战俘营时就常常谈起怎样才能逃跑的倪小毛，走过来在他手心里写了一个“回”字，他用手触了倪一下，表示会心的喜悦，并要他当心，不要显露出来。但是，岳黑旦对他是否能安全回国，怀着非常严重的恐惧和疑虑。
    他在济州岛战俘营里，就曾经遭受了美方和蒋介石特务的磨折。他全身两手都被刺了很多反动口号和文字，移交中立国前又被迫宣过誓、写过血书、立过“连环保”，这使得岳黑旦的自尊心和人格受到难忍的损害。同时，他又看到特务发给的一张中立区图，画着中立区三面受美国和李承晚集团武装力量四个加强师、一个装甲团、一千五百名宪兵的包围，还有两个美方坦克团的炮口对准中立区，只有一个小口才在朝中方面。岳黑旦心想，这怎么能够回国呢？
    岳黑旦到了中立区营场后，啊！还是特务的天下，并且更加恐怖了。营场里增加了很多“警备队员”，铁丝网一圈就有十多个“警备队员”。特务不准战俘听广播，岳黑旦完全不知道中立国遣返委员会的“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”。他每天被迫参加演习“回台湾”等捣乱解释的办法，给看解释帐篷图，叫他们不准走遣返的门，威吓他们即使走出这道门也活不成，五个中立国一个批不准就没有效，而且还要回到营场被砸死；听解释时二十五个人一起要听指挥，前后监视，有一人动摇就抓住他，把他砸死；一个人抓不住，大伙抓，抓住了就处死。黑夜里，很多战俘说梦话要回家，也被拖起毒打，惨叫声不绝，简直是鬼蜮世界。
    岳黑旦进入解释帐篷后，立刻又被帐篷内外的恐怖气氛所淹没，脑子里嗡嗡地叫。他怕有人抓他，不敢走遣返的门，只得口里念了几次“回台湾”，不停地向后门看，不停地擦汗，他说，当时他一会不看就放不下心。当解释代表一再对他解释时，他一再点头；但他还是害怕，不得不又一再摇头。美方“观察代表”和“翻译”这时乘机大肆捣乱，接连打断解释。帐篷外面的特务也高声吵闹，恐怖异常，使他一直下不了决心。他只好拖下去，等待安全的机会。一直拖到最后，其他解释帐篷大都解释完毕，外面安静下来，帐篷内美方“代表”的嚣张气焰已被我方压下去；他从遣返门口望出去又可以看到很多我方代表，这时岳黑旦才胆大起来，相信走遣返的门是安全的。于是，他就大声说“我要回国”；蒂迈雅就把他从遣返的门带到印度部队司令部去了。
    让美方的宣传家们去胡说什么岳黑旦原是坚决反对回家的吧，岳黑旦在说到他到了印度人那里后的情形时，脸上马上露出笑容，这等于对这些胡说给了一个轻蔑的回答。岳黑旦一到司令部，就要印度人答复他是不是马上可以送他回国，印度人答应了。后来他到了隔离帐篷，看到了来自祖国的牙膏、牙刷之类的日用品，还有两位爬铁丝网逃出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员也在那里，他们还送了他一包香烟。岳黑旦完全放心了，他可以安全回国了。
    这说明了什么呢？汉布伦说的“非常残酷的和非常的惩罚”，不正是最适当地用来揭发美方特务迫害我方被俘人员的残酷程度吗？岳黑旦的经历证明：美方特务的恐怖控制像千百条毒蛇一样缠绕着每一个我方被俘人员，而且就在解释帐篷的内外，也还保持着这种控制，使得我方被俘人员即使出来听解释，也不能迅速消除死亡威胁，迅速恢复勇气，依然感到要走出敞开在他们面前咫尺之近的遣返门简直寸步难移。
    王宪章、岳黑旦和其他归来人员从死亡的威胁下解脱出来的事实，充分说明了解释工作为什么不能顺利进行，为什么不能保证我方被俘人员有回家过和平生活的完全自由。
    王宪章和记者分别时，特别激动地告诉记者说，还留在营场的我方被俘人员，内心都有难言的痛苦，越来越难逃跑，哼也不敢哼一声。他要求一定要救他们。
    这是公理与正义的呼吁。我方被俘人员的这种痛苦一天存在，人类尊严就要一天蒙受羞辱。
