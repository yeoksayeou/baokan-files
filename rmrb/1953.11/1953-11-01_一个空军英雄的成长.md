　　The Growth of an Air Force Hero
　　Xu Guangxin, Xie Chunfeng
　　In this year's National Day delegation of heroes returning from the Korean War to attend the ceremony, there was Jiang Daoping, a 23-year-old Special Class Meritorious Volunteer Air Force member, a Second-Class Combat Hero – and recipient of the Second-Class Order of Freedom and Independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He has shot down or damaged seven F-86 Sabre fighter planes of the American invading air force.
　　On January 22nd, Jiang Daoping was only participating in his first combat flight. The unit was returning from a mission when the flight leader gave the order to disperse for landing. Just as he was preparing to land, the radio crackled, "Enemy aircraft over the airfield!" All the other comrades landed, leaving only Jiang Daoping's plane in the air. At that moment, four enemy planes hidden behind the mountains swooped in, some locking onto him and opening fire.
　　"You bastards, let me knock you down!" The situation allowed Jiang Daoping no hesitation. He yanked the control stick, executing a rapid ascent. An enemy plane "whooshed" past in front of him. Jiang Daoping firmly pressed the cannon button, and tracer bullets like fire serpents struck the enemy plane. A cloud of black smoke billowed from the ground as the despicable enemy plane crashed and exploded.
　　A few days later, he shot down another enemy plane over the bay. Two consecutive victories made Jiang Daoping overconfident in his combat skills, and an accident soon occurred.
　　On February 2nd, while on a combat mission, twelve F-86 Sabre enemy planes suddenly attacked from all directions. The flight squadron immediately took fierce counteraction. At this time, Jiang Daoping looked back to monitor the enemy, losing his position in the formation. The flight leader, Song Yichun, saw that Jiang Daoping had drifted to the left. He was very worried, quickly moving closer to Jiang Daoping while calling out, "I'm coming to form up with you!" Jiang Daoping rushed forward and rejoined the formation. But Song Yichun's plane fell behind again, and at that moment, the enemy planes opened fire on Song Yichun.
　　Song Yichun being attacked while trying to rejoin Jiang Daoping's formation made Jiang Daoping extremely distressed. Soon after, Song Yichun returned. After landing, Jiang Daoping held his hand tightly, unable to speak for a long time.
　　After this battle, Jiang Daoping became silent.
　　One day, just after a discussion meeting, Jiang Daoping disappeared. Brigade Political Commissar Zhou Yeshan searched for him everywhere, finally finding him sitting alone, leaning against a tent, head bowed towards the sun.
　　"Jiang Daoping, what are you thinking about?" Political Commissar Zhou asked, walking to his side. Jiang Daoping looked at the political commissar with hopeful eyes and replied, "I'm thinking about how to form up properly and fight the enemy fiercely together with my comrades!" The political commissar nodded. Jiang Daoping continued, "This time, I lost my position in the heat of battle, making my comrades worry about me while they were attacking the enemy. I'm not afraid of the enemy attacking me. But one person's loss of formation often affects the entire battle. My flight leader Song Yichun was in great danger this time! Although he ultimately shot down one and damaged another enemy plane before returning, I failed to fulfill my duty as a wingman..."
　　After listening to this frank statement, the political commissar deeply felt the source of our soldiers' invincible strength. Political Commissar Zhou sincerely comforted him, told him methods of learning, and finally grasped his hand, saying, "I believe you will form up well and fight the enemy, because you are a Communist Party member!"
　　Yes, Jiang Daoping is a strong Communist Party member. He is good at fighting tenaciously and also good at learning tenaciously. He often deeply contemplates the strengths and weaknesses in battle. If he doesn't understand something, he asks his comrades. On the ground, he proactively practices formation with his comrades. In the air, he always pays attention to the flight leader's every move. With the help of his comrades and the experience of several battles, he overcame the difficulties he encountered in formation. At the same time, his shooting skills also improved significantly.
　　From then on, Jiang Daoping always stayed in formation, fought even more bravely, and fully played the role of a wingman. He shot down three more enemy planes and damaged two more.
　　On March 7th of this year, on the way to the combat zone, squadron leader Li Shiying discovered two unidentified aircraft. He led the squadron towards them. At this time, two F-86 Sabre enemy planes swooped over. It looked like they were going to attack the flight leader's group. Because the enemy was flying with the sun behind them, they didn't see Jiang Daoping and his flight leader who were slightly behind. But they clearly saw the enemy. They didn't take action immediately, pretending not to see them. When the enemy got closer, under the cover of Song Yichun, Jiang Daoping got into position and fired a volley at the enemy's flight leader, wounding it. He turned around and attacked the enemy's wingman, who fled. Just then, two robbers who had sneaked up from the left rear suddenly swooped down on Jiang Daoping's flight leader. His flight leader turned the plane, and Jiang Daoping closely followed behind to cover him, successfully helping him shoot down one of the attacking enemy planes. They turned back and flew wingtip-to-wingtip to catch up with the flight leader's group.
　　One afternoon, on the way back, a pair of enemy planes followed behind the flight leader's group. Before the enemy could get close to the flight leader's group, Jiang Daoping spotted them. "The cunning fellows are coming again!" Jiang Daoping's eyes flashed with fire. He notified the flight leader's group to climb up, and then told his flight leader, "Let's hit them!" The pair of flight leader and wingman flew to the left like one person, then dived, angled to the left, and fired a barrage of fiery shells at the enemy. The enemy quickly ran to the right. Jiang Daoping immediately followed his flight leader to intercept. With a turn, Jiang Daoping happened to be chasing right in the middle of the two robbers' rear. The flustered enemy was forced to split left and right in an attempt to escape. The situation was like someone grabbing two tails, not wanting to let go of either. Jiang Daoping first aimed at the enemy's flight leader turning left, and with a burst of fire, this robber burst into smoke and crashed. Before the enemy had even fallen to the ground, he had turned around and showered the enemy's wingman with hail-like shells. This robber also crashed, trailing smoke. These two were the sixth and seventh enemy planes shot down and damaged by Jiang Daoping. (Attached picture)

　　一个空军英雄的成长
    许广信　谢春峰
    今年国庆节志愿军归国观礼代表团英雄的行列里，有个二十三岁的志愿军空军特等功臣、二级战斗英雄——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国二级自由独立勋章获得者蒋道平。他曾先后击落、击伤了美国侵朝空军的七架佩刀式飞机。
    一月二十二日，蒋道平当时才第一次参加战斗飞行，部队执行任务回来，长机下了解散着陆的命令。正准备着陆的当儿，无线电里通知：“机场上空有敌机！”其他同志都着陆了，空中只剩了蒋道平一架飞机，这时隐藏在山背后的四架敌机窜过来，有的咬上了他，向他开火了。
    “狗东西，让我敲掉你！”情况不容许蒋道平有任何犹豫，他猛拉操纵杆，来了个急上升，一架敌机“唰”地一声冲到他前面。蒋道平狠狠地按住炮钮，火蛇一样的曳光弹射在敌机身上，只见地上腾起了一股子黑烟，可恶的敌机摔在地上爆炸了。
    过了几天，他又在海湾上空击落了一架敌机，连续两次的胜利，使得蒋道平开始对自己的战斗技术过分自信起来，很快就发生了意外的事。
    二月二日这天，他们在执行战斗任务时，突然从四面冲来十二架佩刀式敌机。飞行中队立刻采取了猛烈的反击行动。这时候，蒋道平回头去监视敌人，拉下了距离。长机宋义春一看，蒋道平侧到左边去了。他心里十分着急，一面迅速向蒋道平靠近，一面叫：“我来向你编队！”蒋道平冲到前面编上了队。但宋义春的飞机又远了，这时，敌机便向宋义春开火。
    宋义春为找蒋道平编队而受到攻击，这件事使蒋道平非常苦闷。不一会，宋义春回来了，着陆后，蒋道平紧紧地握着他的手，半天说不出一句话。
    从这次战斗以后，蒋道平表现沉默了。
    一天，刚刚开完讨论会，就不见了蒋道平。大队政委周野山四处找他，才见他独自靠在帐篷旁边，向着太阳低头坐着。
    “蒋道平，你在想什么？”周政委走到他的身边问。蒋道平用希冀的眼光望着政委回答说：“我在想如何编好队，和战友们一道狠狠地打击敌人！”政委点了点头。蒋道平继续说下去：“我这次在剧烈的战斗里掉了队，叫同志们在进攻敌人的时候还替我担心。敌人打我，我不怕。但是一个人的掉队，往往要影响整个战斗。这次我的长机宋义春多危险呀！虽然最后他还击落击伤了敌机各一架回来，可是，我没有尽到僚机的职责……”
    政委听完这段坦率的述说，深深感到我们战士不可战胜的力量的源泉。周政委诚挚地安慰了他，告诉了他学习的方法，最后握住他的手说：“我相信你会编好队和敌人战斗的，因为你是共产党员！”
    是的，蒋道平是个坚强的共产党员，他善于顽强地战斗，也善于顽强地学习。在平时常常深思着战斗中的优缺点，弄不通了就问同志们，在地面，主动找同志们一起练习编队，在空中随时注意长机的一举一动，经过同志们多方的帮助和几次战斗的锻炼，他在编队中遇到的困难解决了。同时在射击技术方面也提高了许多。
    从此以后，蒋道平始终编在队列里，更加英勇地战斗着，并且充分发挥了僚机的作用。又击落了三架敌机和击伤了二架敌机。
    今年三月七日这一天，在赶赴战区的路上，中队长李世英发现了两架来历不明的飞机。他带着中队向它飞去。这时两架佩刀式敌机窜过来了。看样子要攻长机组，由于敌人是顶着阳光飞来的，没有看见和在稍后的蒋道平和他的长机。但他们却清楚地看到了敌人。他们并没有马上采取行动，佯装没有看见，等敌人靠近了，在宋义春的掩护下，蒋道平占好了位置，向敌人的长机进行了一排猛射，打伤了它，回过头来又向敌人的僚机攻击，敌人的僚机逃跑了。正在这时，忽然从左后方偷偷地赶来的两个强盗，向着蒋道平的长机俯冲下来，他的长机扭转机头，蒋道平就紧紧地跟在后面掩护，顺利地协同他击落了前来偷袭的一架敌机，拉回头比翼地赶上了长机组。
    另一天下午，我们的飞机在返航途中，有一对敌机从长机组的后面跟了上来。没等敌人接近长机组，就被蒋道平一眼扫见，“狡猾的家伙又来了！”蒋道平两眼冒火，他通知长机组提起来后，就告诉了他的长机：“我们揍它！”这对长僚机像一个人一样的向左飞了过去，紧接着一扣机身，侧到左边，对准了敌人打出炽烈的炮弹。敌人赶紧向右边跑。蒋道平立刻跟着自己的长机拦截上去，一转身，蒋道平正好撵到两个强盗的后方的正中。慌里慌张的敌人，被迫左右分开企图逃命。这情势，便像一个人揪住了两条尾巴，哪一条都不想放，蒋道平先瞄准了左转的敌人的长机，一阵射击，这个强盗就冒起了一阵浓烟栽下去了。敌人还没掉到地上，他已经掉过头来把冰雹一般的炮弹打在敌人的僚机身上，这个强盗也拖着浓烟栽下去了。这两架是蒋道平击落击伤的第六架和第七架敌机。（附图片）
    平常，蒋道平同志很喜欢和大家一块谈笑。这是他和地勤工作人员讲述战斗故事的情形。  （照耀  摄）
