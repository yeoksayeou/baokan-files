Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 19th: According to the reports submitted to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) by the neutral nations inspection teams after conducting on-site inspections of rear area ports in southern Korea, and the judgments made by the NNSC after reviewing these reports, it has been proven that since the armistice, the US side has repeatedly failed to accurately report to the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) and the NNSC regarding the entry and exit of military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into and out of Korea. Furthermore, they have imported a large amount of reinforcing materials of this kind from outside Korea, seriously violating the provisions of the armistice agreement. In response, Senior Colonel Li Sang-jo, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the MAC, lodged a strong protest with the US side at the MAC meeting on November 18th. The full text of the protest is as follows:

    On November 10, 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission submitted to the Military Armistice Commission a comprehensive report on the entry and exit of military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into and out of Korea during the period from July 27 to September 30, 1953, and offered comments on the report. The comprehensive report and comments of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission undoubtedly prove that during this period, your side failed to accurately report to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the entry and exit of military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into and out of Korea, and also imported reinforcing materials of this kind from outside Korea. This is a serious violation of the armistice agreement.

    On July 31, 1953, your side used the "Tahir Seafarer" ship to transport one hundred and six 4.2-inch mortars, packed in boxes, into the port of Busan, and unloaded them on the docks of Busan port between July 31 and August 5. Your side has not reported the import of these mortars to the Military Armistice Commission, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, or its neutral nations inspection team stationed in Busan. Moreover, since the armistice agreement came into effect, your side has never exported mortars, so the import of mortars cannot be allowed at all. The report of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has pointed out that the import of these weapons is a violation of the armistice agreement.

    The numbers of military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition entering and leaving Korea reported by your side to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are frequently inconsistent with the numbers reported by the neutral nations inspection teams based on their inspections. The incorrect figures reported by your side in September, as pointed out in the report of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, show that your side is obviously adopting the deceptive method of providing incorrect figures, violating the armistice agreement, and attempting to import reinforcements from outside Korea. In the case of combat aircraft alone, the figures reported by your side in September attempted to use deception to enable your side to bring in one hundred and two more combat aircraft.

    The replacement should be carried out on the basis of the same type, the same performance, and one-for-one replacement. This is a clear provision of the armistice agreement and must be strictly enforced. However, your side's reports on the types of combat aircraft entering and leaving Korea are often inconsistent with the inspection results of the neutral nations inspection teams. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission pointed out: "According to the existing reports of the United Nations Command and the neutral nations inspection teams, doubts have arisen as to whether the replacement of combat aircraft is carried out on the basis of the same type, the same performance, and one-for-one replacement." Regarding the series of facts about your side's violation of the armistice agreement raised in the report of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, I lodge a strong protest with your side and demand that your side immediately cease the entry of reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea, provide accurate reports on the entry and exit of such personnel and materials into and out of Korea, and, in accordance with the requirements of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, immediately provide the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with a detailed report on the types of all combat aircraft that your side entered and left Korea during the period from July 27 to September 30, 1953.

    美方从朝鲜境外输入增援性的军事人员和作战物资
    我方强硬抗议美方破坏朝鲜停战协定
    【新华社开城十九日电】根据各中立国视察小组在朝鲜南部各后方口岸进行现地视察后向中立国监察委员会所提出的报告，以及中立国监察委员会在审定这些报告后所作出的判语，证明美方自停战后屡不据实向军事停战委员会及中立国监察委员会提出有关军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药进出朝鲜的正确报告，并从朝鲜境外运入了大量增援性的此类物件，严重违反了停战协定的规定。对此，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将于十一月十八日在军事停战委员会上向美方提出了强硬抗议。抗议全文如下：
    中立国监察委员会已于一九五三年十一月十日送交军事停战委员会关于一九五三年七月二十七日至九月三十日期间有关军事人员及作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药进出朝鲜的综合报告，并就该报告提出了评论。中立国监察委员会的综合报告和评论，毫无疑问地证明了你方在此期间未向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会据实提出有关军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药进出朝鲜的精确报告，而且还自朝鲜境外输入增援性的此类物件。这是对于停战协定的严重的违反。
    一九五三年七月三十一日，你方以“塔希尔海员”号轮船，将一百零六门四点二英寸口径的迫击炮装箱运入釜山港口，于七月三十一日至八月五日之间，卸在釜山港口的码头上。关于运入这项迫击炮一事，你方根本没有报告过军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会及其驻釜山的中立国视察小组，而且自停战协定生效以来，你方也从未运出过迫击炮，因此就根本不能容许输入迫击炮。中立国监察委员会的报告里已指出了这项武器的运入乃是对于停战协定的违反。
    你方向军事停战委员会与中立国监察委员会所报告的军事人员以及作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药进出朝鲜的数字，和中立国视察小组根据视察所报告的数字经常不符。中立国监察委员会的报告中所指出的在九月份内你方所报告的不正确数字，说明你方显然是采取提供不正确数字的蒙混办法，违反停战协定，企图自朝鲜境外输入增援。仅就作战飞机一项而言，你方九月份内所报告的数字，就企图以欺骗蒙混的办法，使你方能够多进入一百零二架作战飞机。
    替换应在同样类型、同样性能、一件换一件的基础上进行，是停战协定的明确规定，必须严格执行。但你方关于进出朝鲜的作战飞机的类型的报告，却又经常与中立国视察小组的视察结果不符。中立国监察委员会指出：“根据联合国军与中立国视察小组的已有报告，对于作战飞机的替换是否按同类型、同性能、一件换一件的基础进行产生了怀疑。”对于中立国监察委员会的报告中所提出的一系列的你方破坏停战协定的事实，我向你提出强硬抗议，并要求你方立即终止自朝鲜境外进入增援性的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，对于此类人员与物件的进出朝鲜提出精确的报告，并依照中立国监察委员会的要求，立即向中立国监察委员会提供一九五三年七月二十七日至九月三十日期间所有你方进出朝鲜的作战飞机的类型的详细报告。
