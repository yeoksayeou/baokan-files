    越南人民军拔除西贡附近敌军据点九处
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社三十日讯：十月上半月，越南人民军继续在南越的西贡周围地区主动出击，共拔除据点九处，杀伤许多敌军。
    十月一、二两日，人民军在西贡附近的嘉定、西宁地区拔除了周盛县和新红县的敌军据点两处，并粉碎了敌军在杨明珠县北部的一次扫荡。十四日，人民军又向边鉴据点的敌军发起进攻，全歼敌军一个连，缴获迫击炮两门、机枪八挺、步枪三十多支和弹药三吨。
    在西贡以西的龙朱沙地区，人民军在十月一日拔除和摧毁了敌军据点四处，并袭击了赶来增援的敌军一个连，杀伤敌军四十六名。附近的敌军害怕被歼，纷纷抛弃据点向高岭县城逃跑。
    同时，人民军在美萩、巴地等地的频繁出击，也使敌军遭到很大损失。十月十日，人民军摧毁了美萩省的美隆据点，缴获步枪三十八支；接着在第二天又包围了隆田据点。隆田守敌慌忙逃跑，丢弃了大量武器、弹药。十月八日，人民军在巴地的平安里地区伏击敌军的一支内河运输队，击沉敌军登陆艇一艘，全歼运输队的敌军指挥官。
