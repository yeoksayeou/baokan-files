The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission convened an enlarged Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference at Huairen Hall in Beijing from November 1st to 5th.

This Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference was the largest of its kind since the liberation of the motherland. A total of 412 delegates attended the conference, representing a wide range of regions, including Southeast Asia, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.

At the opening ceremony of the conference, He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered the opening speech. She first explained the relationship between the general line and general task of our country during the transition period and overseas Chinese, as well as the issue of transitioning to socialism. Finally, she mentioned the situation of overseas Chinese and pointed out the main direction of their current efforts. She said: "Today, both the domestic situation and the international environment are exciting and beneficial to us. But precisely because of this, the aggressive groups and their pawns are very fearful and hostile to it. Therefore, the situation of overseas Chinese abroad is still very complex and difficult. Overseas Chinese must rely on their own unity and mutual assistance to protect their legitimate rights and interests, and carry forward the fine tradition of running cultural undertakings to enhance the friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the local people. Overseas Chinese already have a strong motherland, and the motherland and the people are always concerned about overseas Chinese."

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Li Zhuchen, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke.

During the conference, the delegates listened to the "Report on Overseas Chinese Affairs Work in the Past Four Years" delivered by Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. In his report, Liao Chengzhi first described the great achievements of our country's work in various fields in the past four years, and summarized the situation of overseas Chinese affairs work in various aspects over the past four years. Finally, he called on overseas Chinese to unite more widely for mutual assistance and mutual benefit, protect their legitimate rights and interests, and unite closely around the motherland.

The delegates also listened to the "Report on Reception and Resettlement of Returned Overseas Chinese and Refugee Overseas Chinese" and the "Report on Educational Work for Returned Overseas Chinese Students" delivered by Zhuang Xiquan and Fei Zhendong, Deputy Directors and Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, as well as the reports on overseas Chinese affairs work from Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan provinces and the East China region.

The delegates listened to the "Report on Consultation and Generation of Overseas Chinese Representatives to the National People's Congress" delivered by Director He Xiangning. In this report, He Xiangning first explained the great significance of the promulgation and implementation of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China" in our country's political life. She also put forward opinions on how to implement the provisions of the "Election Law" regarding the number of overseas Chinese representatives and the generation of overseas Chinese representatives, saying: "Overseas Chinese are widely distributed, the population in each region varies greatly, and the environment in which overseas Chinese live is also different. Therefore, in order to take care of these situations and achieve comprehensive consideration, regarding the principle of allocating the number of overseas Chinese representatives, we suggest: basically referring to the population situation, while also paying attention to taking care of regions, and in order to facilitate consideration, it is also necessary to combine several regions with small overseas Chinese populations into one quota." She said: The generation of overseas Chinese representatives to the National People's Congress should take into account the situation of overseas Chinese abroad, so "general election" and "nomination" are both difficult. She suggested adopting the method of "consultation" to generate overseas Chinese representatives. She also put forward a specific plan for the allocation of overseas Chinese representatives in each region of the National People's Congress, and submitted it to the conference for discussion.

After listening to the above reports, the delegates held heated discussions in groups on the issues raised in the reports. On the afternoon of the 5th, all the delegates unanimously approved the above reports, and according to the thirty overseas Chinese representatives to the National People's Congress stipulated by the "Election Law," decided to allocate them as follows: Malaya 5, Thailand 4, Indonesia 4, Vietnam (including Laos and Cambodia) 2, Burma 1, North Borneo (including Sarawak) 1, Philippines 1, Korea and Mongolia 1, Japan 1, India and Pakistan 1, Europe 1, the Americas 2, Africa 1, Oceania 1. The remaining 4 are reserved for contingencies. Regarding the method of consultation to generate overseas Chinese representatives, the delegates expressed their full support and approval, and authorized the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government to convene a meeting at an appropriate time next year for further consultation and decision, and then submit it to the Central Election Committee for final approval.

At the closing ceremony of the conference, overseas Chinese representatives from various regions spoke enthusiastically, congratulating the brilliant achievements of the conference.

The conference was declared closed amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience after the closing remarks by Li Tiemin, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央华侨事务委员会召开侨务扩大会议
    就全国人民代表大会华侨代表名额的分配作出决定
    中央人民政府华侨事务委员会于十一月一日至五日在北京怀仁堂召开侨务扩大会议。
    这次侨务扩大会议是祖国解放以来规模最大的一次侨务会议。出席会议的代表共四百一十二人，代表性非常广泛，包括东南亚、朝鲜、蒙古、日本、欧洲、美洲、非洲、大洋洲等地区。
    在会议的开幕式上，由中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝致开幕词。她首先说明了我国在过渡时期的总路线和总任务与国外华侨的关系，以及过渡到社会主义的问题。最后，她提到国外华侨的处境，并指出他们当前主要的努力方向。她说：今天无论是国内情况与国际环境，都是令人兴奋，都是对我们有利的。但正因为如此，侵略集团及其爪牙对此是十分畏惧和仇视的。因而华侨在国外的处境，还是十分复杂和困难的。国外华侨要保护自己的正当权益，必须依靠自身的团结互助，并发扬兴办文化事业的优良传统，增进华侨与当地人民的友好关系。华侨已经有了强大的祖国，祖国和人民是时刻都在关怀着华侨的。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通和中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会副主任委员李烛尘也讲了话。
    会议期间，代表们听取了中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员廖承志所作的“四年来侨务工作的报告”。廖承志在报告中首先叙述了我国在过去四年中各方面工作的巨大成就，并概括了过去四年侨务工作中各方面的情况。最后他号召国外侨胞更广泛地团结起来进行互助互济，保护自己的正当权益，紧密地团结在祖国周围。
    代表们也听取了中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员庄希泉和委员费振东所作的“接待与安置归侨、难侨工作报告”和“归国华侨学生教育工作的报告”，以及广东、福建、云南等省和华东区的侨务工作报告。
    代表们听取了何香凝主任委员所作的“关于协商产生全国人民代表大会华侨代表问题的报告”。在这一报告中，何香凝首先说明了“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”的公布施行在我们国家政治生活中的重大意义。并对如何执行“选举法”关于华侨代表名额和华侨代表产生问题的规定提出意见说：“华侨分布的地区广阔，各地区人口数目相差很大，而华侨所处的环境也各有不同。因此为了照顾这些情况和做到多方面的照顾，关于华侨代表名额的分配原则，我们建议：基本上是参照人口的情况，同时也必须注意照顾地区，而为了便于照顾，还需要将若干华侨人口少的地区，合为一个名额。”她说：全国人民代表大会华侨代表的产生，要照顾国外华侨的处境，因此“普选”和“推选”都是困难的。她建议采取“协商”的方法产生华侨代表。并对全国人民代表大会各地区华侨代表名额的分配，提出了具体方案，提付大会讨论。
    听完以上报告后，代表们就报告中所提出的问题，分组展开热烈的讨论，五日下午，全体一致通过了以上的报告，并根据“选举法”所规定的全国人民代表大会三十名华侨代表名额，决定分配为：马来亚五名，泰国四名，印尼四名，越南（包括寮国、高棉）二名，缅甸一名，北婆罗洲（包括沙朥越）一名，菲律宾一名，朝鲜、蒙古一名，日本一名，印度、巴基斯坦一名，欧洲一名，美洲二名，非洲一名，大洋洲一名。余四名保留，作为机动。关于以协商的方法产生华侨代表，代表们表示完全拥护和赞成，并授权中央人民政府华侨事务委员会在明年选择适当时机召开会议再作协商决定，然后呈报中央选举委员会最后批准定案。
    在会议的闭幕式上，各个地区的华侨代表热烈发言，庆贺这次会议所取得的光辉成就。
    会议由中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员李铁民致闭幕词后，在全场热烈掌声中宣告结束。（新华社）
