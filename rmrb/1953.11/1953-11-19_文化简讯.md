    76 Factories and Mines in Beijing Establish Sanatoriums for Tuberculosis Patients

    Seventy-six factories and mines in Beijing have established sanatoriums for tuberculosis patients, addressing the convalescence needs of 1,268 employees suffering from tuberculosis. Currently, 470 employees have recovered and returned to work after convalescence; an additional 158 are able to participate in partial work after convalescence.

    The sanatoriums established by various factories and mines are based on their own needs and possibilities. Leaders of each unit attach great importance to the establishment of sanatoriums, providing assistance in many ways. For example, after the trade union of the No. 1 Construction Engineering Company Directly under North China investigated the situation of workers suffering from tuberculosis, it promptly reported it to the Party committee and administration, resolving issues of housing, funding, and personnel, and establishing a sanatorium with 35 beds. In the early stages of construction, the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory, in the face of housing shortages, managed to free up three rooms for employees with more severe tuberculosis to recuperate. After the factory construction was completed, production returned to normal, and it exceeded the production plan for the second half of last year, the sanatorium was gradually enriched and expanded.

    Qinghai Provincial People's Government Health Department Convenes Symposium of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners

    The Qinghai Provincial People's Government Health Department convened a symposium of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in October to discuss how to unite TCM practitioners of all ethnic groups to carry out mass medical and health work during the period of national construction. More than 30 representatives of TCM practitioners from various ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Mongolian, in agricultural and pastoral areas of the province attended the meeting.

    Over the past four years, health departments at all levels in Qinghai Province have paid close attention to the work of uniting TCM practitioners of all ethnic groups and have helped them study and improve their medical skills. The Qinghai Provincial People's Government Health Department has held two training classes for TCM practitioners. Health departments in 14 counties (cities) have convened various symposiums 169 times, and health worker associations have been established in 8 counties (cities). TCM practitioners of all ethnic groups have made certain achievements in cooperating with the People's Government to carry out medical prevention work and the patriotic health movement. After full deliberation and discussion, the symposium unanimously agreed that in agricultural areas, health worker associations should be used, and in pastoral areas, symposiums should be organized regularly to further strengthen the unity of doctors of all ethnic groups. Health departments of people's governments at all levels should attach importance to uniting and helping TCM practitioners of all ethnic groups, fully utilize their enthusiasm, and serve the people of all ethnic groups.

    Second Archaeological Personnel Training Class Graduates

    The second archaeological personnel training class, jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Peking University to cooperate with the large-scale basic construction projects of the state to carry out the clearing and excavation of ancient tombs and ancient ruins underground, concluded on November 4 in Zhengzhou, where field practice was conducted, after three months of classroom learning and field practice.

    The entire class consisted of 89 students, cadres sent by cultural institutions from all over the country. During the month and a half of classroom learning, the students studied historical materialism, cultural relics laws, basic knowledge of cultural relics preservation and display, Chinese archaeology, and field archaeology methods, recognizing that the protection of cultural relics is an indispensable task in the national cultural undertaking, and mastering the basic knowledge and techniques of cultural relics and archaeological excavation. Vice Premier of the State Council Guo Moruo and Vice Minister of Culture of the Central Ministry of Culture Liu Zhiming personally gave special reports to the training class. During the month and a half of field practice, under correct leadership and using scientific methods, the students excavated 59 Warring States and Han tombs in the Luoyang area and 280 square meters of the Erligang Yin Dynasty cultural ruins in Zhengzhou. From concrete practice, the students initially grasped the entire procedure of field excavation. Now, the students from all over the country have returned to their original cultural relics work posts.

    北京有七十六个厂矿企业自办肺病休养所
    北京市已有七十六个厂矿企业自办肺病休养所，解决了一千二百六十八个患肺病职工的休养问题。现在已有四百七十个职工经过休养后恢复健康，重新参加工作；另外还有一百五十八人经休养后已能参加部分工作。
    各厂矿企业的休养所是根据本身的需要和可能开办的，各单位的领导上对举办休养所都很重视从多方面加以协助。如华北直属第一建筑工程公司工会调查了工人患肺病的情况后，及时向党委和行政反映，解决了房屋、经费和人员问题，设置了一个有三十五张病床的休养所。北京美术印刷厂在建厂初期房屋缺乏的情况下，设法腾出三间房屋让肺病比较严重的职工休养；到建厂结束，生产转入正常并超额完成了去年下半年生产计划后，又逐步充实和扩大了休养所。
