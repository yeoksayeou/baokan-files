    Cadre Dong Wuning of the Political Department of the North China Military Region Levies Funds for Funeral, Arousing Public Dissatisfaction
    Li Ruyi from the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China writes: Dong Wuning, a cadre of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, is from Nan Zhuzhuang Village, Second District, Ninghe County, Hebei Province. In September of this year, his mother passed away. When he took leave to return home, his mother had already been buried for more than ten days. Local farmers were busy harvesting the remaining crops of autumn, but Dong Wuning disregarded agricultural production and gathered more than two hundred villagers, both men and women, young and old, to hold a "memorial meeting" for his mother for a whole day. At the same time, he spent 2.3 million yuan on paper figures, paper horses, and other superstitious items, of which 1.2 million yuan was public funds from the village for buying reeds, and another 1.1 million yuan was what he had the village government levy from the masses (which has not yet been returned).
    Dong Wuning's erroneous actions have already aroused dissatisfaction among the local farmers and damaged the political prestige of the Party and the People's Liberation Army. It is suggested that the leaders of the Political Department of the North China Military Region seriously investigate and handle this matter.

    华北军区政治部干部董伍宁摊款治丧引起群众不满
    中国人民银行河北省分行李如意来信：华北军区政治部干部董伍宁，河北省宁河县二区南珠庄村人。今年九月，他母亲病故。他请假回家时，他母亲已安葬了十多天。当地农民群众正在抢打残秋，董伍宁竟不顾农民生产，召集全村男女老少二百多人为他母亲开了一天的“追悼大会”。同时，他还花了二百三十万元糊纸人、纸马等迷信品，其中一百二十万元是村中买苇子的公款，还有一百一十万元则是他让村政府向群众摊借的（至今未还）。
    董伍宁这种错误做法，已经引起了当地农民群众的不满，损害了党和人民解放军的政治威信。建议华北军区政治部领导方面认真检查处理这件事。
