    Confession of Lieutenant George F. Brooks, Pilot of the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, U.S. Air Force
    I am George Francis Brooks, Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, 27 years old, service number AO-1911075. My hometown is Summit Hill, Pennsylvania. I joined the Navy in February 1944, was discharged in June 1946, and joined the Air Force on July 8, 1949. I arrived in Korea on September 11, 1952, and was assigned to the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing as an F-51 aircraft pilot. At 10:00 AM on November 25, 1952, I was shot down near Haeju City and captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    On September 11, 1952, I arrived at K-10 base, the headquarters of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. On September 13, 1952, I arrived at K-46 base, the headquarters of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. I was assigned to the Group Training Section and ordered to report to the Training Section at 8:00 AM on September 15, 1952, to prepare for ground school training.
    At 8:00 AM on September 15, 1952, I reported to the Group Training Section. Along with me, nine newly arrived pilots reported to begin ground school training on the same day. They were Lieutenant Dibble, Lieutenant McLaine, and I don't remember the other seven. At ground school, we were introduced to Lieutenant Robert Taylor. At 8:10 AM that morning, Lieutenant Taylor began teaching us a class on germ warfare in the ground school classroom. The above-mentioned newly arrived pilots, assigned to the Group Training Section for combat training, attended this germ warfare course with me.
    Lieutenant Taylor began his lecture, saying: "Gentlemen, you have all heard about germ warfare and know that China is accusing us of conducting germ warfare. Well, I will now tell you that we are conducting germ warfare and how to conduct germ warfare." We had learned about China's accusations on the radio and in newspapers, but we thought it was just propaganda, so we were all shocked to hear Lieutenant Taylor's words.
    Lieutenant Taylor continued: Currently, the 18th Group is using typhoid, typhus, malaria, smallpox, yellow fever, and cholera germs.
    Lieutenant Taylor said that at that time, the 18th Group was using two methods of conducting germ warfare: spraying bacterial liquid and dropping bacterial liquid from the air. The bacterial liquid was stored in fuel tanks, and each aircraft could carry two fuel tanks, hung on bomb racks on the wings. These fuel tanks could be used for spraying or dropping from the air.
    The fuel tank used for spraying works by air pressure, which is supplied by an air pump driven by the engine. This pump inputs air pressure into the bacterial fuel tank through an air pressure transmission pipe installed on the wing. After the inside of the fuel tank is pressurized, it sprays the liquid from the spray pipe, which is operated with a button. After spraying, the fuel tank must be dropped to avoid bringing the germs back to base.
    The fuel tank used for dropping from the air does not have an air pressure transmission pipe or a spray pipe. Other than that, the two types of fuel tanks, used for dropping from the air and for spraying, are completely the same. When dropping the fuel tank, just press the bomb release button at the end of the control stick.
    Lieutenant Taylor told us that some aircraft had already been modified for spraying bacterial liquid fuel tanks. The 12th Squadron would use spray-type bacterial fuel tanks, but not the entire 18th Group would use them. He also told us that we would all receive a training mission in which we would spray and drop fuel tanks filled with water.
    Finally, Lieutenant Taylor told us not to talk about the contents of the germ warfare class, not to talk about anything about our missions, and not to mention germ warfare when writing letters to family or friends. This concluded the lecture.
    On the morning of September 26, 1952, when I reported to the Ground School of the Training Section, I found that I was scheduled for a germ warfare flight training. Lieutenant Taylor gave us a briefing, saying that we would first spray water and then drop the empty fuel tanks, and the exercise location was the Suwon practice range. We were to start spraying on the way to Suwon and then drop the fuel tanks. Lieutenant Taylor was the leader of this flight training. We flew to the practice range spraying all the way, dropped the empty fuel tanks, and flew back to K-46 base. A total of four F-51 aircraft participated in this flight training.
    At 8:30 AM on October 7, 1952, the Group Intelligence Officer gave our squadron a briefing on a germ warfare mission in the Group Briefing Room. He said: "Mission number 1805, germ warfare, four aircraft. The mission is spraying, each aircraft carrying two bacterial liquid fuel tanks. The target area is twenty miles west of Haeju. Take off at nine o'clock. Don't forget to drop the fuel tanks after spraying."
    We received a weather report: the target area was clear, with a slight breeze blowing from the northwest. We were also informed of the escape and evasion signals for that month, as well as the letter and signal diagrams for ground friendly forces to air communication. A total of four aircraft participated that time. Lieutenant Kempston was the squadron leader.
    After the briefing, we went to the squadron equipment room to get flight gear and aircraft numbers. Then, we went to the airfield to check the aircraft and start the engines to prepare for take-off. At nine o'clock, the aircraft were in the air. We formed a combat formation, aligned our direction, and flew towards the target area. We flew over Seoul and advanced along the coastline of the Haeju Peninsula towards the target area. As we approached the target area, we began to descend. When we reached the target area, we turned into the land airspace. As soon as we crossed the coastline, we started spraying, flying north along some valleys. When the spraying was completed, we dropped the fuel tanks, turned left, and flew towards the coast. When we reached the coast, we aligned our direction and flew towards K-46 base. After landing, we returned the flight gear and went to the Group Intelligence Section to report.
    Lieutenant Kempston, the squadron leader, reported to the officer in charge of the report. The report content was: Mission number 1805, germ warfare mission, a total of four aircraft, have successfully sprayed and dropped eight fuel tanks.
    My second germ warfare mission was on October 12, 1952. Our squadron of four aircraft entered the land airspace from Cho-do Island and flew east. When we reached the railway from Pyongyang to Sariwon, we turned and flew towards Sariwon, starting to spray at the same time. Spraying was completed about five miles from Sariwon. The leader of this spraying mission was Lieutenant Guteson.
    My third germ warfare mission was on October 19, 1952. The target area was five miles west of Haeju. Our squadron of four aircraft started spraying flying north from there. Captain Ensignius was the leader, and Lieutenant Kempston also participated in this mission.
    My fourth germ warfare mission was on October 26, 1952. That time the target area was in the area thirty miles south of Cho-do Island, on the southwest corner of the Haeju Peninsula. After our squadron of four aircraft entered the land airspace, we began to spray flying northeast. The leader this time was Captain Ensignius, and Captain Scheffel also participated in this mission.
    The briefing and reporting situations and procedures in my second, third, and fourth germ warfare missions were similar to my first germ warfare mission, so I will not repeat them. In the above three missions, I personally sprayed two bacterial liquid fuel tanks each time. Our squadron sprayed a total of eight bacterial liquid fuel tanks in each mission.
    My fifth germ warfare mission was on November 15, 1952. Twenty-four pilots received a general briefing given by the Group Intelligence Officer. This mission was led by Group Commander Colonel Brinson. After the general briefing, we were divided into three groups, each consisting of eight aircraft. Colonel Brinson, Colonel Perigo (Wing Commander), Lieutenant Colonel Frayne (Commander of the 12th Squadron), Lieutenant Guteson (my leader), and myself, went to the 12th Squadron Briefing Room, where Colonel Brinson gave our group a briefing. He told us that we would each carry two bacterial liquid fuel tanks prepared for air dropping. The Group Intelligence Officer had already given us a general target area in the general briefing. Colonel Brinson informed us of our specific target area. The target area was twenty miles east of Pyongyang, some streams parallel to a major east-west supply line.
    We took off at 10:15 and flew north towards the target area. As we approached the target area, we began to descend. Colonel Brinson dropped his fuel tanks first, climbed back to high altitude, and circled over the target area, watching the other aircraft drop their fuel tanks. I dropped two bacterial liquid fuel tanks. Brinson's group dropped a total of sixteen bacterial fuel tanks. When the last aircraft had dropped its fuel tanks, we climbed to nine thousand feet, aligned our direction, and flew back to K-46 base. Everyone gathered in the Intelligence Section briefing room, and Colonel Brinson reported on the flight mission.
    I participated in a total of five germ warfare missions in the 18th Group.
    I personally believe that germ warfare is inhumane and should not be used. Germ warfare should be prohibited, and any country that conducts germ warfare should be condemned. I am very regretful for my participation in germ warfare, but sorrow cannot undo what I have already done.

    美国空军第十八战斗轰炸机联队第十八战大队第十二战斗轰炸机中队驾驶员中尉乔治·弗·勃鲁克斯的供词
    我是乔治·弗朗西斯·勃鲁克斯，美国空军中尉，今年二十七岁，军号AO—1911075。我的家乡在宾夕法尼亚州苏默特希尔镇。我于一九四四年二月参加海军，一九四六年六月退伍，一九四九年七月八日参加空军。一九五二年九月十一日到达朝鲜，分配在第十八战斗轰炸机联队第十八战斗轰炸机大队第十二战斗轰炸机中队当F —51型飞机驾驶员。一九五二年十一月二十五日上午十时，我在海州城附近被击落，为中国人民志愿军俘获。
    一九五二年九月十一日，我到达第十八战斗轰炸机联队司令部所在地K —10基地。一九五二年九月十三日，我到达K —46基地第十八战斗轰炸机大队司令部。我被指派到大队训练科并奉命在一九五二年九月十五日上午八时向训练科报到，准备受地面学校训练。
    一九五二年九月十五日上午八时，我向大队训练科报到。与我同时去报到准备在同一天开始地面学校训练的，共有新到的九个驾驶员，他们是迪布尔少尉、麦克来恩少尉，其他的七个人我记不起来了。在地面学校，我们被介绍给罗伯特·泰勒中尉，那天上午八时十分，泰勒中尉在地面学校的教室里，开始给我们上关于细菌战的课。上述分配在大队训练科受战斗训练的新到的驾驶员，和我一起听了这次细菌战课程。
    泰勒中尉开始讲课，他说：“诸位，你们都已经听到了关于细菌战的事情，也知道了中国正在控诉我们进行细菌战。好，我现在就告诉你们，我们正在进行细菌战，以及如何进行细菌战。”我们曾在无线电及报纸上知道中国的控诉，但是认为只是宣传，因此听到泰勒中尉的话，大家都震惊了。
    泰勒中尉继续说：现在第十八大队所使用的细菌是伤寒、斑疹伤寒、疟疾、天花、黄热病及霍乱。
    泰勒中尉说，当时第十八大队采用两种进行细菌战的方法，即喷射细菌液体和空投细菌液体。细菌液体装在油箱里，每架飞机能带两个油箱，挂在两翼的炸弹架上。这种油箱可以用作喷射，也可以空投。
    作喷射用的油箱，靠空气压力而起作用，空气压力由一个靠引擎推动的空气唧筒供给。这唧筒经过装在机翼上的空气压力输送管将空气压力输入细菌油箱。油箱内部受到压力后，将液体从喷射管喷射出来，喷射时用电钮来操作。喷射完了后，必须把油箱丢掉，以免把细菌带回基地。
    作空投用的油箱没有空气压力输送管，也没有喷射管，除此以外，用作空投与喷射的两种油箱完全相同。投油箱时，只要按一下操纵杆末端的投弹电钮就行了。
    泰勒中尉告诉我们，某些飞机已经改装过了，这些飞机作为喷射细菌液体油箱之用。第十二中队将使用喷射式的细菌油箱，但并不是第十八大队全队都使用。他又告诉我们全体都将接受一次训练任务，这次训练任务我们将喷射和投掷装满水的油箱。
    最后泰勒中尉告诉我们，不要谈论细菌战课的内容，不要谈论关于我们的任务的任何事情，也不要在写信给家里或朋友时述及细菌战。这样就结束了讲课。
    一九五二年九月二十六日上午我向训练科地面学校报到时，发现我被排定作一次细菌战飞行训练。泰勒中尉给我们下简令，他说我们将先喷射水，然后将空油箱投下，演习地点是水原演习场。我们准备在到水原去的路上开始喷射，然后把油箱丢下。泰勒中尉是这次飞行训练的领队。我们一路喷射着飞向演习场，把空油箱投下后，飞回K —46基地。这次飞行训练，共有四架F —5 1型飞机参加。
    一九五二年十月七日上午八时三十分，大队情报官在大队简令室里向我们小队下了一个细菌战任务简令。他说：“任务号码一八○五，细菌战，四架飞机。任务是喷射，每架飞机各带两个细菌液体油箱。目标地区是海州以西二十英里。九时起飞，不要忘记在喷射完了以后，把油箱丢掉。”
    我们接到气象报告：目标地区晴朗，有点微风从西北方向吹来，我们也被告知那个月的逃跑与躲避信号，以及地面友军对空联络的字母与信号图。那一次共有四架飞机参加。肯普桑少尉是小队长。
    简令完了以后，我们到中队装备室，取得飞行装备及飞机号码。然后，到机场检查了飞机，发动引擎准备起飞。九点钟时，飞机已在空中。我们编成战斗队形，对好方向向目标地区飞行。我们飞过了汉城，沿着海州半岛的海岸线向目标地区前进。当我们接近目标地区时，就开始下降。到达目标地区时，就转入陆地上空。刚飞越海岸线，就开始喷射，一直沿着一些山谷向北飞行。当喷射完毕以后，我们丢下油箱，向左转弯飞向海岸。到达海岸时，就对好方向向K —46基地飞行。飞机降落后，我们交还了飞行装备，到大队情报科去汇报。
    小队长肯普桑少尉向主持汇报的军官作报告。报告内容是：任务号码一八○五，细菌战任务，共四架飞机，已经很成功地喷射并丢下了八个油箱。
    我的第二次细菌战任务是在一九五二年十月十二日。我们四架飞机的小队，从椒岛进入陆地上空，一直向东飞行，我们到达由平壤到沙里院的铁路时，转而飞向沙里院，同时开始喷射。大概离开沙里院五英里时，喷射完毕。这次喷射任务的领队是古特逊中尉。
      我的第三次细菌战任务，是在一九五二年十月十九日。目标地区是海州以西五英里。我们四架飞机的小队，从那里开始向北作喷射飞行。恩生尼亚斯上尉是领队，肯普桑少尉也参加了这次任务。
    我的第四次细菌战任务，是在一九五二年十月二十六日。那一次目标地区在离椒岛以南三十英里的地区，在海州半岛的西南角上。我们四架飞机的小队进入陆地上空后，就开始向东北方向飞行喷射。这次领队是恩生尼亚斯上尉，席菲尔上尉也参加了这次任务。
    我的第二、三、四次细菌战任务中的简令与汇报情况和步骤，与我第一次细菌战任务相似，因此我不重复叙述了。在以上的三次任务中，我个人每次喷射了两个细菌液体油箱，我们小队在每次任务中，共喷射了八个细菌液体油箱。
    我的第五次细菌战任务是在一九五二年十一月十五日。二十四个驾驶员接受了由大队情报官所授予的一个一般简令。这次任务由大队长布林逊上校率领。一般简令后，我们分成为各由八架飞机组成的三个组，布林逊上校、佩里哥上校（联队长）、弗雷恩德中校（第十二中队中队长）、古特逊中尉（我的领队）和我自己等，到了第十二中队简令室，在那里布林逊上校对我们这个组下简令。他告诉我们，我们每个人将带准备空投的两个细菌液体油箱。大队情报官在一般简令时已经授予我们一个总的目标地区，布林逊上校告知了我们的特定的目标地区。目标地区是平壤以东二十英里处，与一条东西行的主要供应线平行的一些溪流。
    我们在十点十五分起飞，向北飞向目标地区。当我们接近目标地区时，开始下降。布林逊上校最先投下油箱，升回高空，在目标地区盘旋，注视着其他飞机把油箱投下。我投了两个细菌液体油箱，布林逊的小组共投下十六个细菌油箱。当最后一架飞机投下油箱后，我们升到九千英尺，对好方向飞回K —4 6基地。大家都集合在情报科汇报室，布林逊上校汇报了飞行任务。
    我在第十八大队共参加了五次细菌战任务。
    我个人认为细菌战是非人道的，不应该使用。细菌战应该被禁止，任何一个国家进行了细菌战，是应该受到谴责的。我对我参加了细菌战一事，是非常悔恨的，但是悲哀不能把我已经所做的事收回来。乔治·弗朗西斯·勃鲁克斯（签名）美国空军中尉A O—1911075第十八战斗轰炸机联队第十八
