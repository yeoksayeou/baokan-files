Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 4th: The delegations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue issued the following communiqué:

    On November 4th, the ninth meeting of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue was held. Mr. Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, comprehensively commented on the U.S. representative's speech yesterday, refuting his self-contradictory remarks one by one. Mr. Ki Sok-bok pointed out that, due to the pressure of world public opinion, the other party dares not openly deny the existence of the issue of political conference membership; however, they are opposing the discussion and resolution of this issue in various ways. The other party stated on the one hand that all items on the agenda proposed by both parties must be discussed and resolved; but on the other hand, they used various excuses to indicate that they are only prepared to exchange opinions on the membership issue without intending to resolve it. Isn't this self-contradictory? Mr. Ki Sok-bok also sternly questioned the other party on the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference: Since Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement does not exclude neutral countries from participating in the political conference, and the participation of neutral countries is entirely beneficial and necessary for the success of the political conference, what reason does the other party have to oppose the participation of neutral countries? Why is the other party so afraid of neutral countries? Is it because the other party signed a "mutual defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee, preparing to keep U.S. troops in Korea for a long time, and condoning Syngman Rhee's clamor for a northward advance, and they are afraid of exposing these facts before neutral countries? Finally, Mr. Ki Sok-bok solemnly warned the other party: If the other party is truly sincere in holding the political conference as soon as possible, it should no longer delay in agreeing to determine a reasonable agenda and immediately discuss and resolve the issue of political conference membership. The U.S. representative was unable to answer our questions, and only repeated his clichés, expressing his refusal to discuss the membership issue. At the suggestion of the U.S. side, the meeting adjourned until tomorrow.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行
    我方代表驳斥美方代表自相矛盾的滥调
    【新华社开城四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月四日，双方关于政治会议问题的会谈举行第九次会议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生对美方代表昨日发言予以全面评论，将其自相矛盾的言论一一加以驳斥。奇石福先生指出，对方由于世界舆论的压力，不敢公然否认政治会议成员问题之存在；但又多方反对讨论和解决这一问题。对方一方面表示双方所提出的各项议程都必须加以讨论和解决；但另一方面却以各种藉口表示对成员问题只限于交换意见而不准备加以解决。这难道不是自相矛盾？奇石福先生又就政治会议应有中立国家参加的问题，严词质问对方：既然停战协定第六十款并不排斥中立国参加政治会议，而中立国家的参加对于政治会议的成功是完全有利和必要的，对方有什么理由反对中立国家的参加？对方究竟为什么如此害怕中立国家？是否因为对方与李承晚签订了“共同防御条约”，准备使美军长期留在朝鲜，并纵容李承晚叫嚣北进，而害怕把这些事实公之于中立国家之前？最后，奇石福先生正告对方：如果对方对于政治会议的早日召开确有诚意，就应不再迟延地同意确定一个合理的议程，并立即讨论和解决政治会议的成员问题。美方代表无法答复我方质问，仅以其陈腔滥调重复表示拒绝讨论成员问题。会议在美方建议下休会至明日。
