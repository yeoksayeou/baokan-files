    Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government and Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Qian Junrui, Secretary-General; Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; Ding Xilin, Deputy Minister; Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture; and responsible persons from central and capital organs and organizations, as well as figures from cultural and artistic circles, totaling more than 1,200 people, attended the opening ceremony of the Film Week.

    Soviet Ambassador to China, Kuznetsov, and embassy staff were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

    Diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China also attended the opening ceremony.

    Director Guo Moruo delivered the opening speech. He said: Ever since the first Soviet film was screened in our country more than 20 years ago, Soviet films have been loved by our audiences, and this love has been growing day by day. In the past four years, Soviet films dubbed into Chinese have been widely screened in cities and rural areas across our country, reaching hundreds of millions of viewers. This has greatly enriched the cultural life of our people and played an extremely important role in carrying out communist education among our people. He then briefly introduced the content of the films to be screened during the Film Week, pointing out that these films fully demonstrate the Soviet people's heroic fearlessness and their great spirit of contributing all their strength and wisdom to the motherland and the people. He said: This spirit is precisely what we need to build our own country and safeguard world peace. Therefore, we welcome the "Soviet Film Week" and wish it a great success.

    Subsequently, Ambassador Kuznetsov was invited to speak. He expressed his gratitude for the third Soviet film exhibition held in China. He said: The Soviet people and film workers hold the most sincere friendship towards the Chinese people and consider it their responsibility to develop cultural exchanges between the two countries as much as possible. We know that the Chinese people show a strong interest in everything that happens in the Soviet Union. Soviet films have cultivated and continue to cultivate the Soviet people's love for their motherland, and they will undoubtedly help Chinese audiences understand what is happening in the Soviet Union. We are very pleased to commend the Chinese film workers for their excellent skills in translating the dialogue of Soviet films into Chinese. Soviet film workers hope that Chinese audiences will offer friendly criticism of the Soviet films screened during this Film Week and offer their wishes for the future of Soviet films. The Soviet people have watched with particular interest excellent Chinese films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Daughters of China," "People's Warrior," "August 1st Sports Meet," and "National Day 1952." The Soviet people deeply hope that more Chinese films will be shown in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet color feature film "Light Shines on Keordi Village" was also screened at the opening ceremony.
