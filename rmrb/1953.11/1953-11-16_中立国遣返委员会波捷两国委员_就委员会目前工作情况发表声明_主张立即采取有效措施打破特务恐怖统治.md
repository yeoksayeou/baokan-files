Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th – The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued on the 13th statements made at the commission meetings on November 3rd and 11th regarding the current state of the commission's work – providing freedom and convenience for explanatory work. These statements are being released because American newspapers have been disseminating statements and opinions purportedly made by the Swiss and other neutral members of the Repatriation Commission, which seriously distort the truth.

The Polish and Czechoslovak members made it clear that the repeated interruptions of the explanatory work were entirely caused by the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps, while the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces were consistently obstructed and unable to take any effective action against these special agents.

The Czechoslovak member said: “In the prisoner-of-war camps, everything is dictated by the will of the so-called prisoner representatives – the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents. The most important evidence of this fact is that these special agents can decide whether or not the explanatory work will take place.”

The statement continued: But "the Swiss member said that disciplinary and judicial measures, and 'any other coercive action against prisoners of war, will not only be opposed by the Swiss delegation, but may also force its government to reconsider whether it can continue to carry out the work entrusted to it that it has accepted.' It is undoubtedly not accidental that American newspapers and news agencies immediately publicized and emphasized this part of the Swiss statement after receiving it. This proves that this part of the Swiss statement was used to prevent the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from carrying out activities and to hinder the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from successfully completing its mission."

The Czechoslovak member pointed out: Article 7 of the "Terms of Reference" entrusts the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to complete its mission even by compulsory means. Article 7 stipulates that no item in the Armistice Agreement should be interpreted as weakening the power of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its legitimate functions and responsibilities to control the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction. "Refusing to carry out the above-mentioned tasks is a serious violation of the international obligations undertaken by agreeing to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

The Polish member said: “The Swiss member is trying to create the impression that the problem lies in using force against prisoners of war who refuse to listen to explanations. In fact, the problem lies in protecting these prisoners of war from the terror of special agents and special agent organizations; the object of coercive measures is only these special agents... The prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps, including the special agents among them, must abide by discipline and obey the orders issued to them. Needless to say, if it is impossible to take sanctions to enforce these orders, then the entire system of prisoner-of-war camps stipulated in the Geneva Convention will become a dead letter.”

The Polish and Czechoslovak members exposed the lie that the Geneva Convention prohibits the use of force against special agents. The Czechoslovak member said: “The Czechoslovak delegation to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is willing to abide by the Geneva Convention. However, it is equally firmly opposed to abusing specific provisions of the Geneva Convention in violation of the interests of prisoners of war and for the purpose of infringing upon their rights. We do not agree, and will never agree, to such an interpretation of the Geneva Convention, if this interpretation encourages individual criminals among prisoners of war to engage in terror and violence." The prisoners of war in the southern custodial camps are intimidated by special agents, and through special agents, by the former detaining party. "The Swiss member of the Commission himself said: 'Dissenting prisoners of war, especially those who may want to request repatriation, have been subjected to acts of violence.'"

The Czechoslovak member further said: “Until now, we have seen the Swiss delegation oppose all proposals as long as these proposals aim to take effective measures to protect the rights, safety and personal integrity of prisoners of war, so that they are not subjected to coercion, threats and violent actions by special agents among the prisoners of war.”

The Polish member also said: “The so-called humanitarian considerations mentioned for maintaining elements who arbitrarily take criminal actions against fellow prisoners in dire circumstances are completely inconsistent with the correct meaning of the spirit of the Geneva Convention.”

The Polish and Czechoslovak members refuted the unreasonable attitude against so-called "long explanations." The Czechoslovak member said: "We cannot fail to see that this is clearly influenced by the slander and hypocritical propaganda of the US side. Experience has shown that it is very important that the explanation representatives have not engaged in coercion, threats, or violent actions in any explanation. However, on the contrary, these special agents have used unprecedented violence and terror against the prisoners of war, even savagely attacking the explanation representatives, and the prisoners of war have been deceived and intimidated by them."

The Polish member said: “What is disgusting to anyone with humanity is the attitude of condoning ordinary crimes, while fussing over the non-existent suffering of those who are listening to their basic rights about going home.”

The Polish member said: “The root cause of the crisis in the commission is that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was unable to break up the terrorist organizations operating in the camps according to the pre-planned plan when it began its work. In the course of the commission's work so far, the Polish delegation has put forward many specific suggestions that, if accepted by the commission, could have properly carried out these tasks. One of the main suggestions of our delegation is to break the reign of terror by special agents controlling the prisoner-of-war camps.”

The Polish member summarized the reasons for the repeated interruptions of the explanatory work up to November 3 as follows: "At the beginning of the explanatory work, it seemed that due to the activities of terrorist organizations in the prisoner-of-war camps, due to the fact that the Indian Custodial Forces, under orders on October 16, 1953, did not carry out the commission's decision to use force against special agents, and finally, due to the commission's negotiations with the special agents and agreement to only conduct explanations to prisoners of war in camp areas selected by the special agents and in a manner agreed to by the special agents, these special agents and terrorist organizations obtained powerful weapons to carry out their sabotage activities and forcibly detain prisoners of war in the camps. This situation made the special agents even more unscrupulous in their attitude towards the prisoners of war, enabled them to convey false information to the prisoners of war in the name of the commission, and enabled them to completely disrupt the explanatory work. As a result, the explanatory work has only been carried out for four days so far, and the first two days totaled only seven hours. It is also because of this situation that the explanatory work has been interrupted once again."

The Czechoslovak member said: This multifaceted and greatly violates the "Terms of Reference" situation has arisen because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it by the "Terms of Reference." First, prisoners of war encounter force, threats of force, and cruel violence, and cannot exercise their right to be repatriated. Second, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not guaranteed the right of the Korean and Chinese sides to freely and without interference conduct explanatory work during the ninety-day period. Third, prisoners of war have not been given the opportunity to apply for repatriation anywhere and at any time without interference. "All the facts stated above clearly prove that it is special agents and other terrorists who rule the prisoner-of-war camps in the south of the demilitarized zone, not the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The 'custody' of the Commission and its executive agent – the Indian Custodial Forces – is only a presumption and does not actually exist. It can even be said without a doubt that these special agents are carrying out the intentions of the former detaining party. This also violates the provisions of Article 4 of the 'Terms of Reference.' The purpose of Article 4 is to stop the control and custody of the former detaining party over the prisoners of war."

Both the Polish and Czechoslovak members demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission take effective measures to deal with the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents in order to remedy the current situation. The Czechoslovak member pointed out: The legal basis for taking such steps can be found not only in the provisions of Articles 3 and 7 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," but also in many articles of the Geneva Convention. Both the Polish and Czechoslovak members expressed their determination to continue to do everything possible to support every measure taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to fully and strictly implement the "Terms of Reference."

　　中立国遣返委员会波捷两国委员
    就委员会目前工作情况发表声明
    主张立即采取有效措施打破特务恐怖统治
    【新华社开城十四日电】中立国遣返委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员，十三日发表了他们在十一月三日及十一日的委员会会议上就委员会工作——为解释工作提供自由与方便——目前的情况所发表的声明。发布这些声明，是因为美国报纸一直在散播据说是瑞士及其他中立国遣返委员会委员发表的声明和意见，而严重地歪曲了真实情况。
    波兰及捷克斯洛伐克委员明白表示：解释工作一再中断，完全是在战俘营中的国民党和李承晚特务造成的，而中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队却始终受到阻挠，未能对这些特务采取任何有效行动。
    捷克斯洛伐克委员说：“在战俘营中各方面唯所谓战俘代表——国民党和李承晚集团特务——的意志作数。这一事实的最重要的证据就是：这些特务们可以决定解释工作是否进行。”
    声明继续说：但是，“瑞士委员说，惩戒和司法措施及‘任何其他对付战俘的强迫行动，不仅将遭到瑞士代表团的反对，而且可能迫使它的政府重新考虑他们是否可能继续担任他们已接受的委托给他们的工作’。美国报纸和通讯社在得到瑞士的声明后，立即把声明的这一部分大加宣传及强调，这无疑不是偶然的。这证明，就是瑞士声明的这一部分是用来阻止中立国遣返委员会再进行活动，并阻挠中立国遣返委员会胜利完成它的任务。”
    捷克斯洛伐克委员指出：“职权范围”第七款责成中立国遣返委员会甚至可用强制办法来完成它的任务。第七款规定，停战协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下的战俘的权力。“拒绝执行上述任务，就严重地违背了由于同意参加中立国遣返委员会而承担的国际义务。”
    波兰委员说：“瑞士委员企图造成一种印象，即问题在于向拒绝听取解释的战俘使用武力。事实上，问题在于使这些战俘不遭受特务和特务组织的恐怖，使用强制手段的对象只是这些特务……战俘营内的战俘，包括其中的特务，都必须遵守纪律和服从向他们发布的命令。不消说，如果不可能为执行这些命令而采取制裁措施，那么日内瓦公约规定的战俘营的全部制度，就会成为一纸空文。”
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员揭露了所谓日内瓦公约禁止对特务使用武力的谎言。捷克斯洛伐克委员说：“中立国遣返委员会的捷克斯洛伐克代表团愿意遵守日内瓦公约。但是，它同样坚决地反对违反战俘利益为了侵犯他们的权利而滥用日内瓦公约的具体规定。我们不同意，而且永远不会同意这样解释日内瓦公约，如果这种解释会鼓励战俘中的个别罪犯进行恐怖和暴力活动。”南部看管营的战俘受到特务的恫吓，而且通过特务，受到前拘留方的恫吓。“委员会的瑞士委员自己说：‘持异见的战俘，特别是那些可能想要求遣返的战俘，受到了暴力行动。’”
    捷克斯洛伐克委员又说：“到现在为止，我们一直看到瑞士代表团反对一切建议，只要这些建议的目的在采取有效措施以保护战俘的权利、安全和人格，使他们不受战俘中的特务的强迫、威胁和暴力的行动。”
    波兰委员也说：“为维护恣意对处于悲惨情况的同营战俘采取罪恶行动的分子而提到的所谓人道考虑，是完全不符合日内瓦公约精神的正确意义的。”
    波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员驳斥了反对所谓“长时间解释”的无理态度。捷克斯洛伐克委员说：“我们不能不看到，这显然是受了美方的诽谤和虚伪宣传的影响。经验证明，解释代表在任何一次解释中，都没有进行强迫、威胁或采取暴力行动，这是非常重要的。但是，相反地，这些特务分子却对战俘使用了前所未闻的暴力和恐怖手段，甚至野蛮地袭击解释代表，战俘都受到他们的欺骗和恐吓。”
    波兰委员说：“令任何有人性的人感到作呕的是：对于普通的罪行采取默许的态度，而对于那些在听取关于他们回家的基本权利的人们，却小题大做地表示关怀他们不存在的痛苦。”
    波兰委员说：“中立国遣返委员会开始工作之初就没有能够打散按照预定计划在营内活动的恐怖组织，这是委员会发生危机的根源。在委员会到目前为止的工作过程中，波兰代表团曾提出许多具体建议，如果委员会接受这些建议，本可以恰当地执行这些任务。我国代表团的一个主要建议，就是要打破特务控制战俘营的恐怖统治。”
    波兰委员总结到十一月三日为止解释工作屡次中断的原因如下：“在解释工作开始的时候，看来由于恐怖组织在战俘营活动，由于印度看管部队在一九五三年十月十六日的奉命没有执行委员会用武力对付特务的决定，最后，由于委员会和特务谈判，并且同意这样的事情：只在特务同意下，向特务选定的营场战俘，用特务同意的方式进行解释；这样，这些特务和恐怖组织就获得了有力的武器来进行他们的破坏活动，把战俘强扣在营里。这种情况使特务对战俘的态度更无所顾忌，使他们可以用委员会的名义向战俘们传达假消息，使他们可以完全破坏解释工作，其结果，解释工作至今为止只进行了四天，而且头两天总共只解释了七小时。也是因为这种情况，解释工作又一次地中断了。”
    捷克斯洛伐克委员说：这种多方面大大违反“职权范围”的情况之所以产生，是因为中立国遣返委员会没有履行“职权范围”赋予的任务。第一，战俘们遇到武力、武力威胁和残酷的暴力行为，不能运用他们的被遣返的权利。第二，中立国遣返委员会没有保证朝鲜和中国方面在九十天的时期中自由地不受干涉地进行解释工作的权利。第三，没有给战俘以机会在任何地方和任何时间不受干涉地申请遣返。“上面所说的一切事实，清楚地证明，统治非军事区南部战俘营的是特务与其他恐怖分子，而不是中立国遣返委员会。委员会和它的执行代理者——印度看管部队——的‘看管’只不过是一种假定，实际上并不存在。甚至可以毫无疑问地说，这些特务正在执行前拘留方的意图。这也是违反‘职权范围’第四款的规定的。第四款的目的是要停止前拘留方对战俘的控制与看管。”
    波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员都要求中立国遣返委员会采取有效措施来对付国民党和李承晚特务，以补救现在的局势。捷克斯洛伐克委员指出：采取这种步骤的法律根据，不仅见于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的第三款和第七款的条文中，而且见于日内瓦公约的许多条文中。波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员都表示他们决定要继续尽一切力量，支持中立国遣返委员会为了充分和严格执行“职权范围”而采取的每一个措施。
