Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: Explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side was still not resumed on the 19th. This is the third day after the fifth interruption.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission notified the Korean-Chinese side on the 18th, stating that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had failed to isolate and guard the explained and unexplained prisoners of war in accordance with Article 20 of the "Explanation and Visit Work Rules" because the U.S. side's special agents believed this was an indirect method of disrupting their control of prisoners of war and the special agent organizations opposing explanation.

This once again proves that the interruption of explanation work caused by the isolation and guarding issue was entirely deliberately created by the U.S. side and its commanded special agents. This is a new tactic employed by the U.S. side to undermine explanation work since the explanation of prisoners of war in Camp 28 began on the 4th of this month. On the one hand, they arrogantly demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission limit the Korean-Chinese side to completing the explanation of 500 prisoners of war per day. On the other hand, they used various disruptive, delaying, and destructive means to sabotage the Korean-Chinese side's plan to explain 500 people per day. At the same time, they opposed the isolation and guarding of explained and unexplained prisoners of war in order to maintain their special agent organizations controlling the prisoners of war. The U.S. side's destructive actions are clearly aimed at making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force to guarantee the normal progress of explanation work, thereby achieving its fundamental goal of undermining explanation work and forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

The special agent organizations controlling prisoners of war in the current neutral nation custodial camps were painstakingly established by the U.S. side over a long period of time and moved in intact from Jeju Island and other places. Our returning personnel have long revealed that before the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, the U.S. side made meticulous arrangements to continue preserving its special agent organizations. Five days before the signing of the armistice agreement, Colonel Hansen of the Psychological Warfare Office of the U.S. Far East Command (who now frequently appears in the explanation camps to direct the U.S. side's activities to undermine explanation work) said at a meeting of special agent elements above the level of "battalion commander" in the three camps on Jeju Island detaining Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war: After you go to the neutral nation custodial camps, you can maintain the original organization. The UN forces have already arranged this for you. After arriving at the Indian Custodial Force camps, the special agents immediately restored organizations such as the battalion headquarters, company headquarters, and guard teams, continuing to implement extremely strict terrorist rule over the prisoners of war and actively planning to undermine explanation work according to the U.S. side's plan. Before the start of explanation work, the U.S. side's special agent organizations made meticulous preparations: conducting multiple intimidations and deceptions of various kinds against the prisoners of war, forcing prisoners of war to practice disrupting explanation work, and forcing prisoners of war to use "three-person interlocks" to guarantee that they would not request repatriation. After the explanation work began, they made many unreasonable demands to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, such as: requiring explanations to be listened to in groups of twenty-five, requiring return to the original camps after the explanation, and requiring special agent leaders to convene meetings as "prisoner of war representatives" and threaten prisoners of war at the waiting explanation locations. At the same time, in the prisoner of war camps, the special agents adopted bloody means such as murder and torture to suppress prisoners of war who requested repatriation. All of this was to maintain and consolidate the special agent organizations' control over prisoners of war in order to prevent prisoners of war from applying for repatriation.

Facts since the start of explanation work have shown that the special agent organizations in the camps are tools for the U.S. side to undermine explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war, and are the root cause of the difficulties created for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, forcing the explanation work to be interrupted several times. The U.S. side is most afraid that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will take measures to disrupt the special agent organizations, punish and eliminate special agent elements. Therefore, the U.S. side uses "massive bloodshed" and "riots" to threaten and intimidate the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission even opposed the use of force against the special agents, and threatened to withdraw from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, paralyzing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and rendering it unable to implement its "terms of reference." The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that breaking up the special agent terrorist organizations, punishing and eliminating special agent elements, is the key to the smooth progress of explanation work and the successful fulfillment by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of its responsibilities stipulated in the armistice agreement.

### 十九日解释工作因隔离看管战俘问题没有解决又未进行  我方再次表示必须采取有效措施清除特务

    十九日解释工作因隔离看管战俘问题没有解决又未进行
    我方再次表示必须采取有效措施清除特务
   【新华社开城十九日电】十九日朝中方面的解释工作仍然没有恢复。这是第五次中断以后的第三天。
    十八日中立国遣返委员会给朝中方面的通知表示：中立国遣返委员会未能按照“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定把已经解释和未经解释的战俘隔离看管，是因为美方特务认为这是打乱他们的控制战俘和反对解释的特务组织的间接方法。
    这就再次证明：由隔离看管问题所引起的解释工作的中断，完全是美方及其指挥下的特务故意制造出来的。这是自本月四日对第二十八号营场的战俘进行解释以来美方破坏解释工作的一个新战术。他们一方面狂妄地要求中立国遣返委员会限制朝中方面一天必须解释完五百名战俘，另一方面又使用种种捣乱、拖延和破坏手段，来破坏朝中方面一天解释完五百人的计划；同时又反对把已经解释和未经解释的战俘隔离看管，以便保持其控制战俘的特务组织。美方的这种破坏行动显然是要使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不能保证解释工作正常进行，从而达到其根本破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    目前中立国看管营场中的控制战俘的特务组织，是美方长期以来处心积虑地建立起来和从济州岛等地原封不动地搬进来的。我方归来人员早已揭露：在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以前，美方曾为继续保存其特务组织进行了周密的布置。在停战协定签字以前五天，美军远东司令部心理作战处的汉生上校（他现在经常出现在解释营场里指挥美方破坏解释工作的活动）在济州岛拘留志愿军战俘的三个营场里的“大队长”以上的特务分子的会议上说：你们到中立国看管营场以后，可以保持原来的组织，这方面联合国军已经给你们安排好了。到了印度看管部队营地以后，特务们立即恢复了大队部、中队部、警备队等组织机构，继续对战俘施行极其严密的恐怖统治，并按照美方的计划积极策划破坏解释工作。解释工作开始以前，美方的特务组织就进行了周密的准备：对战俘进行多次的各种各样的恐吓和欺骗，强迫战俘演习破坏解释工作，强迫战俘以“三人连环保”来保证不要求遣返；解释开始以后他们更向中立国遣返委员会提出许多无理要求，例如：要求以二十五个人一组听取解释，要求解释完以后仍回原营场，要求让特务头子以“战俘代表”的身分召集会议，到等待解释地点威胁战俘等。同时在战俘营场中，特务们对要求遣返的战俘采取谋杀、拷打等血腥手段来加以镇压。所有这一切，都是为了保持和巩固特务组织对战俘的控制，以阻止战俘申请遣返。
    解释工作开始以来的事实表明，营场中的特务组织是美方破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘的工具，是给中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队造成困难，迫使解释工作几次中断的根源。美方最害怕中立国遣返委员会采取措施打乱特务组织，惩办并清除特务分子。因此，美方就以“大量流血”和“暴动”来威胁和恫吓中立国遣返委员会。中立国遣返委员会的瑞士委员竟也反对对特务使用武力，并且威胁要退出中立国遣返委员会，使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪，“职权范围”无法实施。朝中方面已经屡次指出：打破特务恐怖组织，惩办并清除特务分子，是解释工作得以顺利进行，中立国遣返委员会得以完满地履行其停战协定所规定的职责的关键所在。
