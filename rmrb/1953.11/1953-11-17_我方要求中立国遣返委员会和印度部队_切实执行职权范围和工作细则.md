Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th—The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 15th:

    Thanks to the repeated efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the work of the Korean-Chinese side in explaining to its affiliated prisoners of war, which had been interrupted since November 6, will restart on November 16.

    Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents, under the instructions of the US side, obstructed the Korean-Chinese side from continuing to explain to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Camp No. 22, and the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to take the necessary measures in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the "Mandate of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" to ensure the freedom and convenience of the Korean-Chinese side to carry out explanation work, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has been interrupted once again for the past ten days. According to the provisions of the "Mandate" and the "Working Procedures," the Korean-Chinese side has the full right to explain to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 designated by it; however, in order to prevent the explanation work from continuing to be in a state of stagnation, the Korean-Chinese side expressed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on November 14 its willingness to make another effort and agreed to temporarily not explain to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 22, but instead to start explaining to the prisoners of war in other camps. The Korean-Chinese side also notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on November 15 that it was scheduled to explain to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 53 on November 16.

    The Korean-Chinese side also pointed out to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that if the result of the resumption of the explanation work is still that the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents can arbitrarily disrupt the explanation in the explanation camps as in the past, then the resumption of the explanation work will also be nominal. The Korean-Chinese side has always believed that in order to ensure the implementation of the "Mandate" and the "Working Procedures," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops must take practical and effective measures to gradually eliminate secret agents, break the control of secret agents, and realize the veritable custody of prisoners of war by the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In order to ensure that the explanation work to be resumed can be carried out normally in strict accordance with the provisions of the "Mandate" and the "Working Procedures," the Korean-Chinese side firmly demands that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial troops earnestly guarantee:

    1. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 8 of the "Mandate" and Articles 5 and 18 of the "Working Procedures," strictly prohibit any act by secret agents to obstruct the explanation work, be responsible for maintaining order in the explanation camps, and ensure that there are no more illegal acts of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents coercing prisoners of war to shout loudly, insult, or even beat explanation representatives in the explanation tents. Any secret agent who disrupts the explanation work or beats explanation representatives must be isolated and punished, and the handling situation must be announced to all prisoners of war. The situation in which secret agents openly ride in the jeeps of the Indian custodial troops to direct and coerce prisoners of war in the explanation camps must never be allowed to happen again.

    2. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 4, 8, and 18 of the "Mandate" and Article 14 of the "Working Procedures," strictly prohibit US personnel from disrupting and interrupting the explanation work in the explanation tents, and even openly threatening prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation. In particular, it should never be allowed again for Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents who do not belong to the Korean belligerent party to appear in the explanation tents masquerading as representatives of the US side.

    3. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 8 and 24 of the "Mandate" and Article 23 of the "Working Procedures," immediately terminate the situation in which Swiss or Swedish members of certain affiliated institutions arbitrarily and repeatedly interrupt the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side for a long time, and ensure the freedom and convenience of the Korean-Chinese side to carry out the explanation work according to its proposed plan.

    Whether the explanation work can proceed smoothly depends on whether the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can earnestly guarantee the realization of the above requirements.

    我方要求中立国遣返委员会和印度部队
    切实执行职权范围和工作细则
   【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团十五日发表公报如下：
    由于朝中方面一再的努力，自十一月六日以来陷于中断的朝中方面向其所属战俘进行解释的工作，将于十一月十六日重行开始。
    由于蒋匪特务在美方指使下自十一月六日起阻挠朝中方面继续向第二十二号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释，而中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队又未能根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第七款的规定采取必要措施，以保证朝中方面进行解释工作的自由与便利，致使朝中方面的解释工作，十天来又一次陷于中断状态。根据“职权范围”与“工作细则”的规定，朝中方面有完全的权利向它所指定的第二十二号营场的战俘进行解释；但是，为了使解释工作不至继续处于停顿的状态，朝中方面已于十一月十四日向中立国遣返委员会表示愿意再作一次努力，同意暂不向第二十二号营场的战俘进行解释，而改向其他营场的战俘开始进行解释。朝中方面并即于十一月十五日通知中立国遣返委员会，定于十一月十六日向第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。
    朝中方面同时向中立国遣返委员会指出：如果解释工作恢复的结果，仍然只是使蒋、李特务可以在解释营场内像过去一样地任意破坏解释，则解释
  工作的恢复亦将有名无实。朝中方面一贯认为：要保证“职权范围”和“工作细则”的实施，中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队必须采取实际有效的措施，逐步清除特务，打破特务控制，实现中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队对战俘的名符其实的看管。为了使即将恢复的解释工作得以严格按照“职权范围”与“工作细则”的规定正常进行，朝中方面坚决要求中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队切实保证：
    一、按照“职权范围”第七款、第八款及“工作细则”第五款与第十八款的规定，严禁特务任何阻挠解释工作的行为，负责维持解释营场的秩序，解释帐篷内不得再有蒋、李特务挟制战俘大吵大叫、侮辱甚至殴打解释代表的非法行为。任何破坏解释工作、殴打解释代表的特务，均必须予以隔离与惩办，并将处理情况向全体战俘宣布。在解释营场内，特务公然乘坐印度看管部队之吉普车往来指挥并胁迫战俘的情况，绝不许再行发生。
    二、按照“职权范围”第四款、第八款、第十八款和“工作细则”第十四款的规定，严禁美方人员在解释帐篷中扰乱并中断解释工作，甚至公开威胁战俘不得申请遣返，特别是绝不应再容许不属于朝鲜交战一方的蒋匪特务冒充美方的代表出现在解释帐篷之内。
    三、按照“职权范围”第八款、第二十四款与 “工作细则”第二十三款的规定，立即终止若干附属机构的瑞士或瑞典委员擅自与任意多次并长时间地中断朝中方面解释工作的情况，保证朝中方面按其所提计划进行解释工作的自由与便利。
    解释工作能否顺利进行，端视中立国遣返委员会能否切实保证上述要求的实现。
