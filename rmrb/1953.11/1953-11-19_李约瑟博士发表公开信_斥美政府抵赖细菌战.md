Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th. The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" published on the 14th an open letter from Dr. Joseph Needham, Fellow of the Royal Society and member of the International Scientific Commission that investigated the US germ warfare crimes in Korea and Northeast China. The letter refutes the US government's attempts to deny its germ warfare crimes. The contents of the letter are as follows:

    Recently, some articles have appeared in major national newspapers discussing new aspects of the Korean germ warfare issue. Among many incorrect statements, there is the assertion that the strength of the evidence comes from the confessions of captured American airmen. Therefore, I would like to point out that my belief in the truthfulness of the accusations in no way depends on what the airmen admitted (nor on what they now deny in new and different circumstances). I believe my colleagues on the International Scientific Commission share the same view. As I repeatedly stated last year, we only considered it as conclusive evidence after a large number of Chinese scientists—many of whom I was already familiar with during World War II—provided us with objective evidence that convinced us.

    Some of your readers may share my feeling that the most disturbing feature of the current situation is that the US government is still preparing for germ warfare on a large scale. As demonstrated by the conference on the role of scientists in civil defense held in London last December (see "Nature" magazine, 1952, Vol. 170, No. 957), the possibility of such a war is still difficult to estimate. Another point in the current situation is that the United States still refuses to ratify the Geneva Protocol against such warfare. This is precisely the reason for the recent debate in the United Nations. And the result of this problem is that it is submitted to a committee that apparently never meets for handling, which is considered solved.

### 李约瑟博士发表公开信  斥美政府抵赖细菌战

    李约瑟博士发表公开信
    斥美政府抵赖细菌战
   【新华社柏林十八日电】英国“新政治家与民族”周刊十四日发表了英国皇家学会会员、曾在朝鲜与中国东北调查美国进行细菌战罪行的国际科学委员会委员李约瑟博士的公开信。该信驳斥美国政府企图抵赖进行细菌战的罪行。信的内容如下：
    最近在全国性的大报刊上出现了一些文章，讨论到朝鲜细菌战问题的新的方面。在许多不正确的言论中，有这样的言论，就是说证据的力量是来自被俘的美国飞行人员的供词。因此，我愿意指出，我之所以不得不相信指责的真实性，绝不决定于飞行人员所承认的（也不决定于他们现在在新的、不同的环境下所否认的）。我相信国际科学委员会中我的那些同事也有同样的看法。如我在去年所一再说过的一样，我们总是在大批中国科学家——其中有许多人，我在第二次世界大战时就已经很熟悉的了——提供了客观的证据，使我们相信以后，才认为那是一个确实的证据。
    诸位读者中也许有一些人会与我有同样的感觉，就是目前局势中最令人不安的特色是美国政府仍在大规模准备细菌战。如去年十二月在伦敦举行的讨论科学家在民防中的地位的会议（见“自然”杂志一九五二年一七零卷九五七期）所证明的一样，进行这种战争的可能性仍难估计。目前局势中还有一点是美国仍然拒绝批准反对这种战争的日内瓦议定书。这正是引起最近在联合国的辩论的原因。而这个问题的结果是被提交到显然从来不开会的委员会去处理，就算是解决了。
