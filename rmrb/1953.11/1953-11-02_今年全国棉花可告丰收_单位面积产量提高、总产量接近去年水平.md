This Year's National Cotton Crop Can Be Declared a Bumper Harvest
Unit Area Yield Increased, Total Output Approaching Last Year's Level
[By this newspaper] This year's national cotton harvest is bountiful, with total output approaching last year's level and exceeding the pre-war peak level—the total cotton output of 1936—by more than 46%.

Although cotton suffered continuous waterlogging, drought, and pests and diseases during its growth period this year, thanks to the unremitting struggle of cotton farmers in various regions under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the situation of reduced production was finally averted. According to preliminary estimates, the average unit area yield of cotton nationwide this year may slightly exceed that of last year; since the cotton field area this year is slightly smaller than last year, the total output is about 96% of last year's, but it still exceeds the pre-war peak level—the total cotton output of 1936—by more than 46%, exceeding 1949 by 179%, exceeding 1950 by 74.5%, and exceeding 1951 by 22.9%.

In the southern cotton-producing areas, flower picking has now been basically completed. The weather was clear this autumn, which was conducive to the maturity of cotton bolls. The harvest period in various places was generally five to fifteen days earlier than in previous years, and the phenomenon of stiff petals and rotten flowers was greatly reduced compared with last year. In Binchuan, Kaiyuan, and other places in Yunnan Province, due to the organization of the masses to improve cotton cultivation management techniques this year, production increased by 25%. In the Yanken cotton area of ​​Jiangsu Province, due to this year's focus on pest control, improved weeding techniques, and expansion of autumn cultivation area, coupled with normal rainfall, cotton production is expected to increase by more than 20%; in individual areas such as Sanyu District, it is initially estimated that the district's total cotton planting area is more than 150,000 mu, and the average yield of seed cotton per mu can reach about 150 jin, an increase of 45 jin compared with last year's average yield. Cotton production in Jiangsu Province as a whole is about 10% higher than last year. Cotton production in Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces can both increase by more than 5%. Hubei Province can increase production by about 20%. The cotton production in other provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Guangxi are all close to last year's level. Due to the reduction in cotton field area this year, the output of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces will be slightly lower than last year. Due to severe waterlogging and drought in the later period in Anhui Province, the cotton growth was not good, and it is expected to decrease by 17.7% compared with last year.

In the northern cotton-producing areas, the weather in September and October was sunny, the first frost was later, and there has been no severe frost, which brought favorable conditions for cotton growth. Hebei and Shandong provinces have reversed the situation of late-maturing cotton and reduced production, and the output is only slightly lower than last year. The unit area yield of cotton in Northeast China has increased slightly compared with last year, but due to the reduction of cotton field area, the total output has decreased by about 35.7% compared with last year. Cotton production in Henan Province is about 4% higher than last year. This year, in order to improve the unit area yield of cotton in Shaanxi Province, the province has strengthened the guidance to farmers in various places on scientific cotton planting techniques such as reasonable rotation, close planting, timely irrigation, and pruning. In particular, it has learned from the lessons of cotton production reduction caused by neglecting irrigation work in cotton areas in the past. With the help of Soviet experts, the province studied and formulated the "Technical Guidance Program for Cotton Planting in the Jinghui Canal Irrigation Area" and a work implementation plan, and promoted advanced irrigation methods such as winter irrigation and early spring irrigation. The area of autumn cultivation last year also increased by 5% to 10% compared with previous years. Now, the province's 4.4 million mu of cotton has been basically harvested, with an average yield of 39.2 jin of lint cotton per mu, an increase of 22.5% compared with last year, and the total output has increased by 18.9% compared with last year. The 380,000 mu of cotton fields in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area produced about 60 jin of lint cotton per mu, 1.4 times more than last year's output. The unit area yield of cotton in Shanxi Province has increased compared with last year; although the cotton planting area has decreased, the total cotton output can still approach last year's level.

### 今年全国棉花可告丰收  单位面积产量提高、总产量接近去年水平

    今年全国棉花可告丰收
    单位面积产量提高、总产量接近去年水平
   【本报讯】今年全国棉花丰收，总产量接近去年水平，可超过战前最高水平——一九三六年棉花总产量百分之四十六以上。
    今年棉花生长期间，虽然连续遭受水、旱、病虫灾害，但由于各地棉农在共产党和人民政府的领导下进行了不懈的斗争，终于挽救了减产局面。据初步估计：今年全国棉花的平均单位面积产量可略超过去年；因今年棉田面积较去年略为减少，所以总产量约为去年的百分之九十六，但仍超过战前最高水平——一九三六年棉花总产量百分之四十六强，超过一九四九年百分之一百七十九，超过一九五○年百分之七十四点五，超过一九五一年百分之二十二点九。
    南方各产棉区，目前已基本上完成了摘花工作。今年秋季天气晴朗，有利于棉花开絮成熟，各地一般较往年收花期提早五天到十五天，僵瓣烂花的现象较去年大大减少。云南省滨川、开远等地，因今年组织群众改进了棉花栽培管理技术，增产百分之二十五。江苏省盐垦棉区，因今年抓紧了治虫工作，提高了除草技术，扩大了秋耕地面积，加以雨量正常，估计棉花可增产二成以上；个别地区如三余区，初步估计，全区植棉十五万余亩，平均每亩籽棉产量可达一百五十斤左右，较去年的平均产量增加了四十五斤。江苏全省的棉花约较去年增产一成。浙江省和四川省的棉花都可增产百分之五以上。湖北省约可增产二成。其他各省如云南、贵州、西康、广西等省棉花的产量都接近了去年水平。江西、湖南两省因今年棉田面积减少，产量将略低于去年。安徽省因涝灾严重，后期亢旱，棉花生长不好，预计将较去年减产百分之十七点七。
    北方各产棉区，九、十月份天气晴朗，初霜较迟和还没有降严霜，给棉花生长带来了有利条件。河北、山东两省已经扭转了棉花晚熟减产的局面，产量仅略低于去年。东北棉花单位面积产量较去年稍有增加，但因棉田面积缩减，总产量较去年约减少百分之三十五点七。河南省棉花约较去年增产百分之四。今年陕西省为了提高棉花单位面积产量，对各地农民加强了合理倒槎、密植、适时灌溉、整枝等科学植棉技术的指导，特别接受了历年来因不注意棉区灌溉工作而造成棉花减产的教训，在苏联专家的帮助下，研究和制定了“泾惠渠灌溉区植棉技术指导方案”及工作实施计划，推行了冬灌和提早春灌等先进的灌溉方法。去年秋耕面积也较往年扩大了百分之五至十。现在全省四百四十万亩棉花已基本摘完，平均每亩产量为三十九点二斤皮棉，比去年增产百分之二十二点五，总产量比去年提高百分之十八点九。泾惠渠灌溉区三十八万亩棉田，每亩产皮棉六十斤左右，超过去年产量的一点四倍。山西省今年棉花单位面积产量较去年增加；虽然植棉面积减少，但棉花总产量仍可接近去年水平。
