    The Production Office of the Dezhou Prefecture Should Not Abuse the Issuance of Telephone Telegrams

    A reader, Yin Ziyuan, from Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, writes: The phenomenon of the Production Office of the Dezhou Prefecture having too many "official document forms" has just been reversed, and now the situation of having too many "telephone telegrams" has followed.

    According to incomplete statistics, the Production Office of the Dezhou Prefecture issued 35 telegrams to various counties in the 123 days from May 1st to August 31st. Generally speaking, these telegrams have three characteristics:

    First, frequent repetition. Sometimes telegrams are sent every day for several days in a row. The few telephones in the office are constantly busy. This was the case every day from August 1st to 10th. Sometimes, two telegrams were sent in one day (such as on May 15th and July 12th). Sometimes they repeat documents that have already been issued. For example, methods for preventing corn borers and armyworms have already been printed in pamphlets and distributed to various counties; however, on August 9th, another telegram of more than 450 words was sent.

    Second, lengthy and empty. Telegrams are generally four to five hundred words long, with some reaching eight hundred to a thousand words. Most telegrams are verbose and superficial, using the euphemism of "having a head and a tail," but in reality, the content is empty and fails to explain the issues clearly. For example, a telegram on May 4th introducing the experiences of Dalin Guo Township in Qihe County and Xingzhai Village in Yucheng County in mobilizing the masses to plant cotton only circled around terms such as "starting with mutual aid teams," "conducting education on resisting America and aiding Korea," and "publicizing policies," without explaining specific methods.

    Third, everything is "urgent." Of the 35 telegrams issued from May 1st to August 31st, 25 were marked as "urgent." Even the notice to allocate a sprayer to En County was sent as an urgent telegram. As a result, the lower levels are thrown into a state of "extreme urgency," which actually pushes aside truly urgent matters. Some comrades in the county asked, "What exactly is considered non-urgent?"

### 德州专署生产办公室不应该滥发电话代电

专栏：读者来信摘要

    德州专署生产办公室不应该滥发电话代电
    山东省德州专区读者尹子元来信：德州专署生产办公室“公文表格”多的现象刚刚反掉，“电话代电”多的情况又随之而来。
    德州专署生产办公室从五月一日到八月三十一日的一百二十三天中向各县发出的代电，据不完全统计，就有三十五件。一般说来，这些代电有三个特点：
    一，频繁重复。有时连着好几天每天发代电，办公室里几部电话根本不得闲，八月份从一日到十日，天天如此。有时一天发了两次代电（如五月十五日和七月十二日）。有时则重复已经发过的文件，如防治钻心虫和行军虫的办法，已经印了小册子发到各县；八月九日却又发了一个四百五十多字的代电。
    二，冗长空洞。代电一般是四、五百字，长的达八百字到一千字。大多数代电是穿靴戴帽，美其名曰“有头有尾”，实际上内容空洞，说明不了问题。例如五月四日一份介绍齐河县大林郭乡及禹城县邢寨村发动群众种棉经验的代电，光在“从互助组入手”、“进行抗美援朝教育”、“宣传政策”等名词上打圈子，却没有说明具体做法。
    三，事事“紧急”。从五月一日到八月三十一日所发的三十五件代电中，就有二十五件是“紧急”的。甚至给恩县拨去一部喷雾器的通知，也用紧急代电发出。这样一来，弄得下边“急不胜急”，实际上就把真正紧急的事儿却挤掉了。县里有的同志就问：“到底什么才算不紧急呢？”
