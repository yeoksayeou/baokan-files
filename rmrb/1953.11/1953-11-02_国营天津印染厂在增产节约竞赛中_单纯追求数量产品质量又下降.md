In the production increase and thrift campaign, the state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory, subordinate to the North China Textile Administration Bureau, has a tendency to simply pursue quantity, neglect quality, and only care about production without considering consumer needs. The Qiqiao brand printed cloth and printed gabardine produced by the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory had a very bad impact on the market in the past due to outdated patterns and low quality. The Tianjin Textile Purchasing and Supplying Station, responsible for unified purchase and sales, accumulated more than 100,000 bolts in the second quarter of this year. Starting in May of this year, the Tianjin Textile Purchasing and Supplying Station used many methods to help the factory improve the color and quality of its products. In addition, with the efforts of the factory's employees, the product quality has greatly improved, and sales have also opened up. However, with the development of the production increase and thrift campaign, the quality of the factory's products is declining. The quality of several printed gabardines that recently left the factory has dropped to the level before the improvement in May of this year. The printed colors are very dark, the colors are old, and do not match the colors of the specified production patterns; the pattern misalignment has occurred again.

Currently, the masses need to make cotton quilts, and there is an urgent need for a large number of large-patterned gabardines. However, large-patterned gabardines are more troublesome to operate than small-patterned gabardines. In order to pursue the over-fulfillment of the output plan, the factory, regardless of market needs, resolutely demanded that the usual practice of large-patterned gabardines accounting for one-third of the total output of printed gabardines be reduced to one-quarter, and more small-patterned gabardines with simple operation be produced. In terms of color matching, because the cost of green dye is high, it was originally stipulated that green should not exceed four bolts in each piece, and other colors can be designated for production according to needs. Now, the factory only focuses on producing more blue, which has a high yield rate, and also restricts red and purple colors; while red and purple colors are the most popular among the general public, especially farmers.

The quality of the Qise brand blue cloth and twill produced by the factory is also very low. A large amount of backlog has occurred in the Tianjin Textile Purchasing and Supplying Station and flower and cloth companies in other places. (Nie Tiejun)

    国营天津印染厂在增产节约竞赛中
    单纯追求数量产品质量又下降
    华北纺织管理局所属国营天津印染厂在增产节约竞赛中，存在着单纯追求数量、忽视质量，只顾生产、不顾消费者需要的偏向。该局天津印染厂生产的七巧牌花布及花哔叽，过去因为花样老，质量低，在市场上留下很不好的影响。负责统购统销的天津花纱布采购供应站在今年第二季度就积压了十万余匹。从今年五月份开始，天津花纱布采购供应站用了很多办法帮助该厂改进产品的花色质量，再加上该厂职工的努力，产品质量有了很大的提高，销路也打开了。但是，随着增产节约竞赛的展开，该厂的产品质量却在下降了。最近出厂的几种花哔叽，质量又下降到今年五月份未改进以前的水平。印出以后的颜色阴得很厉害，色泽发旧，和指定生产的图样的颜色不符；花样走版的情形又发生了。
    目前群众要做棉被，迫切需要大量的大花哔叽。但大花哔叽在操作过程上比小花哔叽要麻烦些。该厂为了追求产量计划的超额完成，却不顾市场需要，坚决要求将原来大花哔叽占花哔叽总产量三分之一的惯例降低为四分之一，多生产一些操作过程简单的小花哔叽。在配色上，因为绿色的染料成本高，原来规定绿色在每件当中不得超过四匹，其他颜色可以根据需要指定生产。现在该厂却只顾多生产出品率高的蓝色，对红的和紫的颜色也要加以限制了；而红紫的颜色又是一般群众、尤其是农民所最欢迎的。
    该厂生产的七色牌蓝布和斜纹质量也很低，在天津花纱布采购供应站和其他各地的花纱布公司，都发生了大量的积压现象。（聂铁钧）
