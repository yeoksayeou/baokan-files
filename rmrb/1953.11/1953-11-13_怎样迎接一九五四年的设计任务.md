    How to Greet the 1954 Design Tasks
    Li Zhi
    In order to overcome the shortcomings in the design work of 1953 and to meet the larger-scale basic construction design tasks of 1954, we believe that our design work should be improved by starting from the following aspects.
    I. Quickly and correctly compile the basic construction plan and strive to submit the planning task book to the design unit as soon as possible.
    The planning task book is the most basic basis for design work. For example, if a new factory is to be built, its location, product varieties and specifications, annual production volume, factory construction period, development prospects, coordination with other related factories, the source of production materials and semi-finished products, and the acquisition of various consumables (such as water, electricity, and fuel) must all be specified in the planning task book. Along with the planning task book, various attachments related to the construction area of the factory, product drawings, and technical data are also needed. Therefore, if the planning task book cannot be compiled in time, the entire design work will be delayed. Our lessons this year are worth remembering: at the beginning of the year, the planning task book was not finalized, so we had to stop work and wait for orders. Later, we had to carry out the design according to a plan that had not been finally approved. Our original plan was to design several renovated factories and new factories within a year. Some of the renovated factories had fully launched the design work according to the assumed planning task book, and the designers were all working hard. However, after implementing the Central Committee's correct policy on basic construction, opposing the idea of ​​impatience and rashness, and earnestly studying the balance of all aspects, the design projects were greatly reduced, and the content of the planning task book was also changed, which made almost all of the original designs fail. Our original plan was to design new factory buildings with an area of ​​about hundreds of thousands of square meters, but it was finally reduced to tens of thousands of square meters; after another change, it was increased to more than one hundred thousand square meters. After such several changes, the factory buildings that could have been designed as a whole could only be designed for the civil engineering part first in order to catch up with the construction. After the factory buildings were built, walls were dug and drilled to lay water pipes, heating, electrical facilities, and various pits and trenches. This not only caused waste, but also affected the quality of the new construction project, damaged the beauty of the building, and shortened its service life.
    The aforementioned lessons tell us that for the construction projects needed in 1954, if there is no planning task book or correct and reasonable basic construction plan as a basis, the design work will not be able to move forward, and the passive situation of "design lagging behind construction requirements" will still not be reversed next year.
    II. Vigorously collect original data
    After having the planning task book, the important link that determines the progress of the design work is whether the original data required for the design is sufficient and correct. An important reason why the design drawings of many of our projects this year could not be supplied to the construction site in time is the lack of sufficient and correct original data. For example, for a tool workshop in a factory, process design began at the end of 1952. By April of this year, the civil engineering design had been basically completed, but the foundation part had to be put on hold for a long time due to lack of data. After obtaining the data, all the drawings were designed by the end of June, but the surveying and mapping unit suddenly discovered that the conclusion on the geological problem was wrong, so all the drawings could not be issued. After the surveying and mapping unit re-drilled, obtained soil samples, conducted tests, and made correct conclusions, the drawings were appropriately modified and sent to the construction site. But at this time it was already mid-August, which made the design and construction fall into a passive position. Another example is a comprehensive large factory building in a certain factory, which had already been designed, but it was later found that the local soil conditions did not match the conditions on which the design was based. The design was based on the clay layer with greater pressure resistance listed in the geological report, but what was actually found was loose, large-pore soil layer. In this way, because the original data was obtained very late and the data itself was incorrect, the construction period was also delayed. The project, which could have been completed before this winter, has become a project that requires winter construction or spans years.
    Of course, it is not easy to obtain complete and correct original data. According to our experience, in order to carry out the overall design of a not-too-large rebuilt machine manufacturing factory, a comprehensive technical team of more than 20 people (including civil engineering, general layout, process, water supply and drainage, boilers, heat pipes, heating and ventilation, transportation equipment, power supply, gas supply, etc.) is required to work for more than a month to complete it, and a surveying team and a drilling team are also required. If there are many and complex old buildings, it will take more time. Some data (such as the water temperature in the local seasons) must be recorded for a long time before it can be obtained.
    Therefore, preparing the original data required for the design for the 1954 design tasks should become one of our important tasks at the end of this year. According to the basic construction plan and design projects for 1954, and according to various technical requirements of the design, a plan for drilling, surveying, and obtaining various other data should be put forward and handed over to relevant units for timely preparation. When necessary, a certain number of designers must be organized to go to the site to carry out this work in person.
    III. Summarize experience, improve design quality, and accelerate the design process
    This year we have accumulated a lot of experience in our work. This experience is specific and rich, but it is also scattered and perceptual. If we concentrate and sort out these experiences through summarizing our work, and make it a systematic experience that is mastered by all designers, it will be of great benefit to guiding the increasingly heavy design work in the future.
    According to our experience, in addition to ideological and management summaries, technical experience should also be well summarized. Special attention should be paid to summarizing advanced quota standards and summarizing the most applicable design methods that save national investment. It is necessary to compare several design schemes to discover their respective advantages. When necessary, we can also organize designers to exchange experience and discuss with each other, so that technical experience becomes richer, more complete and more reasonable, and is promoted to be accepted by all personnel. Experience proves that this is the best way to improve the technical level of designers. After our summary, most designers have summarized systematic design experience from their own designs, and finally obtained more than 100 summary reports or professional papers on various designs. Some people have also collected some advanced Soviet quota indicators, which enriched the content of the summary. Many designers said: "These summary reports and papers have become manuals that we can use at any time in future designs." At the same time, through such a summary, designers have also gained a deeper understanding of the advanced nature of Soviet design experience. However, when conducting technical summaries, special attention should be paid to which ones can be generally promoted and adopted, and which ones can only be adopted under certain conditions. If the scope of use of advanced experience is not clearly studied and promoted rashly, it will often be counterproductive and lead to serious errors.
    IV. Replenish the design organization, balance the design forces, and pay attention to training new design cadres
    Our current organization is unsound. Because there are no departments for construction organization design and engineering budget, the design drawings are sent to the construction site, and the construction unit is required to do the budget, count the materials, and organize the construction from scratch. Especially when the amount of work is large, such tasks are often difficult for the construction unit to complete in the short term, often resulting in insufficient material preparation during the construction process, failure to meet design requirements, and delays in construction. At the same time, we can only do civil engineering design, but not water supply and drainage, electrical, heating and ventilation design, so we have to distribute several designs of one project to several units, so that the various designs cannot cooperate with each other. In addition, the existing forces of various types of work within our enterprise are not balanced enough. There are too many process designers and too few civil engineering designers, resulting in uneven workload. Civil engineering designers often work overtime in bursts, while process designers are often idle. All of the above situations need to be changed.
    This year, the leadership assigned us a group of newly graduated university or senior industrial school students. This new design force should be quickly trained and trained so that they can quickly master the business and formally put it into production. There are many ways to train and train. We can organize the original designers to teach them design professional courses according to actual needs; assign them certain design tasks and work with the help of the original designers; organize short-term training classes and mentor apprentices separately, etc. In addition, it is also a very effective method to help them summarize their work, exchange experience, and study advanced design drawings.
    V. Organize and improve standard designs, simplify design steps
    In today's situation where our design strength is still weak, standard designs should be used as much as possible where standard designs can be used. This year, most of our standard dormitory projects, office building projects, and various other welfare buildings have saved a lot of time due to the use of standard designs, allowing a small number of designers to carry out more industrial building designs. This should continue to be done in the longer term. Not only non-industrial buildings can adopt standard designs, but Soviet experts tell us that many industrial buildings can also be standardized. In particular, the structural design in industrial buildings, the components and joints in various structures, various roof trusses, column grids, as well as some industrial auxiliary buildings, and even the civil engineering part of factory buildings, can adopt standard designs or repeatedly use existing designs. This can save a lot of design power. Therefore, we need to re-study and review the standard design drawings that have been used in the past, go deep into the site and the use departments to listen to opinions, and make appropriate modifications to make these designs more perfect.
    In terms of design methods, we can also study some methods to shorten the design process and simplify the design steps. Some of our professional design teams use the method of filling out clear tables to replace complex design calculations, which speeds up the design process. Some design teams have also analyzed and studied the drawings they have made in the past, cut out some commonly used joint details or other drawings, and used them in other designs, which also saved a lot of design time. Another very important item is to find ways to shorten the design time from summarizing and familiarizing with the connection relationships of various designs. According to our experience, due to the lack of overall design experience among designers, they cannot figure out the complex and intricate connections between designs, and cannot figure out the relationship between various designs and the provision of technical conditions to each other, which often leads to untimely, incomplete and incorrect mutual provision of technical conditions, resulting in design rework or suspension of work. In order to prepare for the larger and more complex design tasks, we have organized various professional design teams to study the content of the technical conditions provided to each other between various designs, and compiled them into chart form, and explored the order of providing technical conditions to each other, so that various design work can be truly coordinated and rhythmic.

    怎样迎接一九五四年的设计任务
    力之
    为了克服一九五三年设计工作中的缺点，迎接规模更大的一九五四年的基本建设设计任务，我们认为，应该由以下几方面着手来改进我们的设计工作。
    一、迅速地正确地编制基本建设计划，争取早日把计划任务书交给设计单位
    计划任务书是设计工作最基本的根据。譬如要新建一个工厂，它的地点、产品品种及规格、每年生产量、工厂的建设期限、发展前途、与其他有关工厂的配合、生产材料及半成品的来源、各种消耗品（如水、电、燃料）的取得等等，都要在计划任务书中予以规定。随着计划任务书，还需要各种有关该工厂建设地区情况的附件、产品的图纸及技术资料。因此，如果计划任务书不能及时编定，整个设计工作都要推迟。我们今年的教训是值得记取的：年初，计划任务书没有着落，只得停工待命，后来不得不按照未经最后批准的计划进行设计。我们原订计划是在一年内设计数个改建工厂和新建工厂，有些改建工厂已按假定的计划任务书将设计工作全面铺开，设计人员都紧张地行动起来了。但是，经过贯彻中央对基本建设的正确方针，反对急躁冒进思想，切实地研究了各方面的平衡之后，设计项目大为减少，而且计划任务书的内容也改变了，使得原来的设计几乎全部落空。我们原计划设计的新建厂房面积约数十万平方公尺，最后削减到数万平方公尺；以后又经一次变化，又提高到十余万平方公尺。经过这样几次变更以后，原来可以进行总体设计的厂房，为了要赶上施工，只能先进行土木建筑部分的设计，盖好了厂房以后，再挖墙打洞，敷设水道、暖气、电气设施及各种地坑和地沟。这样不但造成浪费，而且影响新建工程的质量，损害了建筑物的美观，缩短了它的使用年限。
    前述教训告诉我们，一九五四年度需要建设的工程项目，如果没有计划任务书或正确合理的基本建设计划作为依据，设计工作势将寸步难移，明年将仍不能扭转“设计落后于施工要求”的被动局面。
    二、大力搜集原始资料
    有了计划任务书之后，决定设计工作进程的重要一环，就是设计所需的原始资料是否充足和正确。今年我们很多项工程的设计图纸不能及时供给工地，很重要的一个原因就是缺乏充足的和正确的原始资料。例如有一个厂的一个工具车间，从一九五二年底即开始做工艺设计，至今年四月，土木建筑设计已基本上完成，仅地基部分因缺乏资料，不得不长期搁置停工。等到取得资料之后，在六月底将全部图纸设计好了，但勘测单位又突然发现所作关于地质问题的结论是错误的，因而全部图纸不能发出。等到勘测单位重新进行钻探，取得土样，做了试验，并作出正确结论之后，才将图纸作适当的修改，发到工地。但这时已经是八月中旬了，使得设计及施工都陷于被动。又如某厂一个综合性的大厂房，早经设计完毕，后发现当地土壤条件与设计所根据的条件不符，设计中根据的是地质报告书中列出的耐压力较大的粘土层，而实际发现的却是松散的大孔隙土层。这样，由于获得原始资料的时间很迟，资料本身不正确，使得施工期间也推迟了。原来可在今年冬季以前完成的工程，变成了需要冬季施工或跨年度的工程。
    当然，要取得齐备和正确的原始资料，不是很简易的。根据我们的经验，为进行一个规模不太大的改建的机器制造厂的总体设计，需要一个二十余人的综合的技术人员队伍（包括土木建筑、总图、工艺、上下水道、锅炉、热管道、暖气通风、运输设备、供电、气体供应等各方面），工作一个多月才能完成，并且还需一个测量工作队和钻探工作队。如果旧有建筑物众多和复杂，所费时间更多。有些资料（如当地各季度的水的温度）尚须作长期记录，才能取得。
    因此，为一九五四年度设计任务准备好设计所需的原始资料，应该成为我们在今年末的重要任务之一。应该根据一九五四年的基本建设计划及设计项目，根据设计的各种技术要求，提出钻探、测量及获得各种其他资料的计划，交有关单位及时准备。必要时，须组织一定的设计人员亲自去现场进行这一工作。
    三、总结经验，提高设计质量，加速设计进程
    今年我们在工作中积累了许多经验，这些经验是具体的、丰富的，但同时又是分散的、感性的。如果通过总结工作将这些经验集中和整理起来，使它变成系统的、为全部设计人员所掌握的经验，则将对指导今后日益加重的设计工作大有补益。
    根据我们的体会，除应从思想上、管理上进行总结外，技术方面的经验也应该很好地总结。特别要注意总结先进的定额标准，总结既节省国家投资又最为适用的设计方法。需要将好几种设计方案进行比较，发现各自的优点。必要时，并可组织设计人员交流经验，互相讨论，使技术上的经验更趋丰富和完善合理，并推广为全体人员所接受。经验证明：这是提高设计人员技术水平的最好的方法。我们经过总结之后，大多数设计人员均从自己做过的设计中总结出系统的设计经验来，最后得出各种设计的总结报告或专业论文百余篇。有些人还收集了一些苏联先进定额指标，丰富了总结的内容。很多设计人员说：“这些总结报告和论文，成了我们今后设计中随时使用的手册。”同时，通过这样的总结，还使设计人员更深刻地认识了苏联设计经验的先进性。不过，在进行技术上的总结时，要特别注意哪些是可以一般推广采用的，哪些是在一定条件下才可采用的。如果不将先进经验的使用范围研究清楚，便冒然推广，就往往会适得其反，导致严重的错误。
    四、充实设计机构，平衡设计力量，注意培养新的设计干部
    目前我们的机构是不健全的。因为缺少做施工组织设计和工程预算的科室，使得设计图纸发到了工地，要施工单位做预算，统计材料，从头组织施工。尤其是工程量较大时，这样的任务往往是施工单位难以在短期内完成的，常常使得施工过程中发生材料准备不够，施工不能满足设计要求，及拖延工期等情况。同时我们只能做土木建筑设计，而不能做上下水道、电气、暖气通风等设计，因之不得不将一项工程的数种设计分给几个单位做，使得各种设计不能互相配合。此外，我们企业内部现有各个工种的力量也不够平衡，工艺设计人员太多，土木建筑设计人员太少，结果忙闲不均，土木建筑设计人员经常加班突击，而工艺设计人员却往往闲着没事做。上述种种状况都需要加以改变。
    今年，领导上分配给我们一批新毕业的大学专科或高级工业学校的学生。对这一支新的设计力量，应该迅速加以培养训练，使他们很快地掌握业务正式投入生产。培养训练的方法很多，可以组织原有的设计人员，根据实际需要，给他们讲授设计专业的课程；分配给他们一定的设计任务，在原有设计人员帮助下进行工作；组织短期训练班和分别带徒弟等等。此外，经常帮助他们总结工作，交流经验，学习先进的设计图纸，也是很有效的方法。
    五、整理及改进标准设计，简化设计步骤
    在我们设计力量尚感薄弱的今天，在可能采用标准设计的地方，应尽量采用标准设计。今年我们的大部分标准宿舍工程、办公楼工程及其他各种福利建筑物，由于采用了标准设计，节省了很多时间，使得为数很少的设计人员能进行更多的工业建筑设计。在今后较长时期内，仍然要这样做。不但非工业的建筑物可以采用标准设计，苏联专家告诉我们，很多工业建筑物也可以标准化。特别是工业建筑中的结构设计，各种结构中的构件、接头，各种屋架、柱网，以及一些工业的辅助建筑物，甚至厂房的土木建筑部分，都可以采用标准设计，或者反复利用旧有的设计。这样能节省很多设计力量。因此，我们需要将过去使用过的标准设计图纸重新加以研究审核，深入现场及使用部门听取意见，作适当的修改，以使这些设计更趋完善。
    在设计方法上，也可以研究一些缩短设计过程、简化设计步骤的方法。我们有些专业设计组将繁杂的设计计算用填写简明表格的方法来代替，加速了设计的进行。还有些设计组对过去所作的图纸进行了分析研究，将一些可以普遍采用的接头大样图或其他的图纸剪截下来，用到别的设计上去，也节省了很多设计时间。还有很重要的一项，是从总结并熟悉各种设计的联系关系中，找出缩短设计时间的方法。根据我们的体会，由于设计人员缺乏总体设计的经验，摸不清设计之间的复杂错综的联系，摸不清各种设计之间互给技术条件的关系，常常使得相互给的技术条件不及时、不完整和不正确，以致造成设计返工或停工。为了准备迎接规模更大和更复杂的设计任务，我们已组织各专业设计组研究了各种设计之间相互给技术条件的内容，并且编成图表形式，摸索研究互给技术条件的顺序，使得各种设计工作能真正做到协调而有节奏地进行。
