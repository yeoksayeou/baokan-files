Factory 53 is How Comprehensively Learn the Soviet Technology
An Gang

Benefits Inexhaustible

    Factory 53 launched a wave of learning from the Soviet Union in the movement to increase production and practice economy. On the basis of learning Soviet technology, a new upsurge in production has emerged. They realize that comprehensively learning from advanced Soviet experience can not only improve quality and increase production, but also greatly save money. For example, in the past, a certain inspection process in the second workshop only inspected semi-finished products, and no inspection was done during finished product assembly, so the final quality was unknown. After learning from advanced Soviet experience, the semi-finished product inspection was changed to finished product inspection, thus ensuring that the product quality met the standards. In the past, processing workers only considered the processing quality of their own processes and rarely took overall care of the final quality of the finished product; after changing the processes, workers could take care of the whole picture. A comprehensive inspection system was established according to Soviet standards, reducing rejects. The machines saved can be put into production, and workers' wages alone can save 100 million yuan per year.

    Factory 53 improves machines while producing, according to Soviet methods. In half a month, two or three parts were modified on each machine, which reduced the edge material of a certain product by 10 percent. From October to December, the total cost of the factory can be reduced by 1.09 percent in three months. In September, Factory 53 reasonably adjusted manpower according to the advanced Soviet experience of labor division and specialization to improve workers' proficiency. In the past, each machine was managed, operated, inspected (first-level inspection), and adjusted by one worker. Therefore, the workers could not concentrate on operating the machine, and could not take care of everything. Now, according to the Soviet method, workers are organized to be responsible for operation, each specializing in its own field, cooperating with each other, and supervising each other; those in charge of tools guarantee to prepare conditions for the operators, and if the operators neglect quality and produce defective products, the inspectors immediately find out the cause and help in time.

    The benefits of Soviet technical experience are endless. The experience of Factory 53 proves that as long as one studies earnestly and creatively, one can not only learn but also systematically master advanced Soviet technology and guarantee the comprehensive completion of the production increase and economy plan.

To Create Conditions

    Factory 53 began to comprehensively master Soviet technology in September, which is inseparable from the fact that they have done a lot of work in the past. They are creating the conditions for comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union step by step, and at the same time, they are deepening their understanding of the advanced nature of Soviet technology step by step.

    From which aspects to create conditions? As early as 1951, in the quality inspection campaign, they organized technicians to go deep into the workshops, use the Kovalev working method, analyze and summarize the workers' operating actions, and solve the key problems of improving product quality. When using the Kovalev working method, the technicians began to combine with the workers, and realized the preciousness of the workers' practical operating experience. Without the participation of the workers, it was impossible to thoroughly solve any specific technical problem. Since then, everyone has realized that the Soviet Kovalev working method is the correct method to combine technical theory with practical experience, and they successfully revised the technical operating procedures of the whole factory by using this advanced Soviet working method. At that time, the chief engineer of Factory 53 said at the conference for revising the technical operating procedures: "In the old society, dozens of technicians were gathered to work on the formulation for several years, but they still failed to formulate it. Now, after learning from Soviet experience and relying on the masses, it only took about a month to formulate it. This is the crystallization of the experience and wisdom of the working class." This is an important change in the thinking of the technicians of Factory 53 in the past when learning from the Soviet Union. The technicians understood the advanced nature of Soviet technology from the technical organization method, but they did not have a comprehensive knowledge of the advanced nature of Soviet technology. In the implementation of planned management, they learned from the Soviet engineer Tsilminch's machine sub-department repair method, and used the method of division of labor and responsibility to assign the machines of each process to several fitters to strengthen the preventive maintenance of the machines and implement the responsibility system for equipment maintenance and repair. At that time, the implementation of this system changed the serious situation of some workshops with long machine repair time and low equipment utilization rate, shortened the production cycle, and initially achieved balance in production, which also improved the ideological understanding of the technicians, but in fact, it had not yet fully touched on the advanced technical problems of the Soviet Union. In the second half of 1952, Factory 53 began to learn from the Soviet Union more comprehensively. They seized two links to create conditions: The first was to improve the existing equipment to make it suitable for the application of advanced Soviet technology. For example, the Soviet Union used electric furnaces to automatically control the temperature, and they also modified them according to the Soviet model. The second was to promote the Soviet methods of chrome plating, electric spark grinding, and high-speed cutting. After contacting these advanced methods, the technicians greatly improved their understanding of advanced Soviet technology. While implementing the application of high-speed cutting in belt lathes, they criticized the conservative idea that "the efficiency of machines cannot be changed, and is stipulated at the time of design." They learned from a translated article on electric spark grinding from a magazine, and went to the higher-level research department to study. After the trial was successful, they criticized the conservative idea that "non-diamond grinding wheels cannot be used for grinding." This year, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the higher authorities called for the comprehensive implementation of advanced Soviet standards. The technicians were in high spirits, and their thinking was consistent, which created the most favorable conditions for comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union.

First Organize Technicians to Learn

    When learning from the Soviet Union comprehensively, who should learn? The factory director, technicians, and all workers should learn. But the first step is to organize the technicians to learn first. After the technicians understand, they can combine with the workers, use advanced Soviet methods, comprehensively sort out the workers' operating experience, and help the workers gradually improve their technical level. The method of mobilizing technicians in Factory 53: The first is to organize technicians to study Soviet materials, study the achievements of fraternal factories in applying advanced Soviet experience, and study Soviet technical translations in newspapers and magazines. In the study, it is necessary to make everyone understand the political and economic significance of advanced Soviet experience and prevent simply deducting theories, formulas, and nouns from books. It is necessary to make everyone understand that the biggest feature of Soviet experience is the combination of theory and practice. A technician said: "I deeply realize that there is nothing in advanced Soviet technology that does not take care of the actual operation of workers. It is truly a product that comes from practice and rises to theory." If this idea is not understood, the technicians will run into trouble when they do it. At the beginning, it is often to swallow it whole, trying to completely imitate the Soviet model, mechanically handling it, and not understanding how to use our existing conditions to integrate and understand it. If they run into trouble, they will doubt it and want to come back and use the old backward methods. Therefore, in organizing technicians to study Soviet materials, it is necessary to constantly correct the thinking of technicians and make them consciously abandon capitalist conservative and backward ideas. The second step is for technicians and experienced veteran workers to study together and conduct experiments steadily. This is a relatively intense process of ideological struggle. Many people feel that there is no problem when they learn, but problems arise when they experiment. The occurrence of these problems is often caused by the one-sidedness of the learning method. For example, the second workshop was very smooth when it started the experiment in the first process, but the technicians neglected the operation of the next process when learning from the Soviet experience. When it was changed to the next process, it would not work. At this time, someone doubted and said: "I have never seen such a practice." Later, after checking, it was found that the technicians had modified the size on the Soviet materials and used the "old method." Then everyone realized that Soviet experience is a complete new thing, and it is impossible to modify it with backward methods. Later, it was changed according to the Soviet method, and finally, it was successful. The third is to organize technicians and veteran workers to discuss based on the experimental results. Technicians who come from schools lack experience but have a certain theoretical foundation and can do some analysis work; technicians who come from workers lack theory but have rich experience. These two types of people can cooperate with each other to make up for their shortcomings and learn from each other's strengths. They jointly study practical and feasible measures and plans, and immediately apply the Soviet experience that is completely suitable for our specific situation; for those that can be used only by appropriately changing the conditions, specific measures are formulated to gradually realize them; and those that cannot be used at present are used as weapons to create some new methods. In this way, the technical requirements of the Soviet Union can be basically fully realized. The obvious sign of the change in the thinking of the technicians of Factory 53 is that only a few people were learning Russian outside the factory in the first half of 1952. Now everyone is learning, and the factory has specially opened Russian training classes for them. Among the eighteen technicians, five can freely read Russian materials. In the past, there was not a single Russian book in the technical materials, but now it is full of two bookcases, and Russian technical books have become the spiritual food for the technicians to learn from the Soviet Union.

Mobilize Workers to Master Advanced Technology

    If technicians learn advanced technology but do not combine with workers, in the words of a technician, it is "equal to waste." Workers are direct producers, and they have formed a material force when they master advanced technology. Factory 53 selected the second and sixth workshops as the pilot units for this study of advanced Soviet technology. The results of the experiment greatly promoted the movement to increase production and practice economy in the whole factory. According to the experiment in the eighth process of the second workshop, changing production according to the Soviet method can achieve: (1) Eliminating one process and adding other improvement measures, the whole workshop increased labor efficiency by 13.63 percent; (2) Implementing labor division and specialization increased output by 7 percent, saved tools by 26 percent, and increased machine utilization rate by 5.5 percent; (3) Reducing repairs by 12 percent, reducing repair time by 54 percent, and implementing the machine maintenance responsibility system can reduce machine repair time by 2.1 percent. The average production efficiency of the whole workshop can be increased to 46.85 percent by the end of the year.

    How to organize and promote workers to conduct experiments in the workshop process? First, the leadership consciously chooses the key production (as explained by the comrades of Factory 53: the standard of the key workshop or process is that it is the most important in production and also the place where there are more problems.) workshops and processes to conduct experiments. The method of the experiment is: opening a training class for work section leaders and group leaders, and the technicians teach the advanced Soviet technology to the work section leaders and trade union group leaders. The method of comparing the old and new technologies enables them to grasp some basic theories of Soviet technology. After the work section leaders and group leaders are trained, they select the key processes, and the work section leaders are responsible for teaching the Soviet technology to the workers, and the technicians assist them. The technical ability of the work section leaders and group leaders is improved, and they have established prestige among the workers, becoming the core of promoting the Soviet technical operating methods. It is easy to succeed in this way. Second, technicians and experienced veteran workers jointly form a special task force to conduct experiments on a technical reform, paying attention to selecting workers who are close to the Soviet operating standards as "living models." This time, when experimenting with the Soviet operating methods, most of the workers in the second workshop could not master it. Later, it was found that a master worker's technology was close to the Soviet standard, so they helped him improve it, organized him to perform, and taught his method to the workers in two weeks, and everyone's technology improved. This is the specific application of the Kovalev working method, which they used in 1951. At that time, a certain process produced a lot of rejects, and the technicians found Zhang Xihe, who did not produce rejects, and helped him summarize his experience. After everyone discussed it, they formulated the operating procedures that everyone should abide by, and eliminated the rejects. According to the requirements of implementing Soviet standards, the leadership put forward the main topics to the workers and staff, mobilized the workers to tap potential and find tricks, and called on the workers to combine their own experience to create advanced experience suitable for our existing conditions. At the same time, carry out mass technical learning, mobilize workers to discuss and watch operation performances while practicing themselves. They believe that only by gradually improving the technical proficiency of workers to the advanced level of the Soviet Union can it be considered that they have truly comprehensively learned from the Soviet Union. Third, the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League go deep into the masses during the experiment to understand the situation, and determine the focus and methods of mass political work during the experiment according to the workers' ideological situation, operating technical situation, and machine equipment situation. Solve the workers' ideological concerns such as fearing "changing production quotas and getting less piece-rate wages" and "specialization will not allow them to fully master the technology", and promptly point out that the direction of specialization is to train workers of various types of work into skilled technicians, and at the same time change the piece-rate wage reward method so that the personal interests of workers are closely combined with the overall interests. When new achievements appear in the experiment, the trade union promptly conducts publicity and mobilization to prepare the workers in other workshops ideologically and create conditions for comprehensively learning from Soviet technology. This time, when conducting the experiment in the eighth process of the second workshop, the workers in the fifth process asked: Why can't we "get a share" and asked to participate in the experiment. This kind of automatic request of the staff to learn advanced technology is the successful foundation for the whole factory to master Soviet technology.

    The staff of Factory 53 enthusiastically learn from Soviet experts, and Soviet experts have given them many valuable suggestions. They learn and experiment as soon as they are given suggestions. For example, Soviet experts once put forward a method to improve product quality, and they fully realized it in less than two weeks. This active learning attitude is a good example.

    Comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union has become the basic driving force for Factory 53 to realize its production increase and economy plan this year.

    五三厂是怎样全面学习苏联技术的
    安岗
    好处说不完
    五三厂在增产节约运动中掀起了学习苏联的热潮。在学习苏联技术的基础上已经出现了生产的新高涨。他们认识到全面地学习苏联先进经验，既能提高质量和增产，又能极大地节约。如二车间某检查工序过去只作半成品的检查，成品装配不再检查，这样最后的质量是否合乎标准并不知道，但经过学习苏联先进经验，将半成品检查改为成品检查，这样就保证了产品质量合乎标准。过去加工工人只考虑在本道工序的加工质量，很少全面照顾成品的最后质量；改变工序后，工人都能照顾整体按照苏联的标准建立了全面的检验制度，减少了废品。节省出来的机器可以投入生产，仅只工人的工资每年就可节约一亿元。
    五三厂按照苏联方法一面生产一面改进机器，半个月内在每台机器上改了两三个部件，便使某项产品边料减少百分之十，从十月到十二月三个月中共可降低全厂成本百分之一点零九。五三厂在九月份按照苏联劳动分工专业化的先进经验合理地调整了人力，提高工人熟练程度。过去是各台机器都由一个工人管理、操作、检验（第一级检验）、调整工具与机器。因此，工人在机器上不能专心一意进行操作，顾了这边顾不了那边。现在按照苏联办法，把工人组织起来分工负责操作，各有所专，互相合作，并相互监督；管工具的保证为操作的人准备好条件，管操作的人如果忽视质量出了次品，负责检验的人立即查出并找出原因及时帮助。
    苏联技术经验的好处说不完。五三厂的经验证明：只要认真地用创造性的态度来学，不但可以学会，而且可以系统地掌握苏联的先进技术，保证全面地完成增产节约计划。
    要创造条件
    五三厂九月份开始全面地掌握苏联技术，这同他们过去作了很多的工作是分不开的。他们一步一步地创造着全面学习苏联的条件，同时也一步一步地加深对苏联技术先进性的认识。
    从哪几方面创造条件呢？远在一九五一年，他们在质量大检查运动中，就曾组织技术人员深入车间，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，分析和总结工人的操作动作，解决了提高产品质量的关键问题。在运用郭瓦廖夫工作方法时，技术人员开始同工人有了结合，认识到工人实际操作经验的可贵，没有工人参加，任何一个具体技术问题都不可能全面与彻底搞好。从此，大家认识到苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法乃是使技术理论与实际经验结合起来的正确方法，他们运用苏联这个先进工作法顺利地修订了全厂技术操作规程。当时，五三厂总工程师在修订技术操作规程大会上曾表示：“在旧社会，集中了几十名技术人员，搞了几年的制订工作，结果还是没有搞出来，现在，学了苏联经验，依靠群众只用了一个月左右的时间就订出来了，这是工人阶级的经验和智慧的结晶。”这是五三厂技术人员在过去学习苏联思想上的一个重要转变。技术人员从技术组织方法上懂得了苏联技术的先进性，但对于苏联技术的先进性还没有全面的知识。在实行计划管理中，他们学习了苏联齐尔民赫工程师的机器分部包修法，用分工负责的方法把每个工序的机器包给几个钳工，加强对机器的预防保养工作，实行设备维护检修责任制。当时实行这个制度，转变了某些车间机修时间多，设备利用率低的严重情况，使生产周期缩短，初步达到了生产上的均衡，这对技术人员的思想认识也有所提高，但实际上还没有全面接触到苏联的先进的技术问题。一九五二年下半年五三厂开始了比较全面学习苏联的工作。他们抓住了两个环节来创造条件：第一是改进现有设备，使它适于应用苏联先进技术。譬如苏联用电炉自动控制温度，他们也按苏联的样子进行改装。第二是推行了苏联的镀铬、电火花研磨和高速切削法。技术人员接触这些先进方法后，大大提高了对苏联先进技术的认识，他们在实行把高速切削法应用在皮带车床的同时，批判了“机器效能不能变更，是设计时就规定死了的”的保守思想。他们从杂志上学到一篇关于电火花研磨的译文，又到上级研究部门去学习，试验成功后，就批判了那种硬说什么“非金刚砂轮不能研磨”的保守思想。今年增产节约，上级号召全面实现苏联先进标准时，技术人员情绪很高，思想是一致的，这就造成全面学习苏联最有利的条件。
    先组织技术人员来学
    全面学习苏联，谁来学？厂长、技术人员和全体工人都应该学。可是第一步还得先组织技术人员来学。技术人员学明白后同工人结合起来，可以运用苏联的先进方法，综合整理工人的操作经验，帮助工人逐步提高技术水平。五三厂发动技术人员的方法：第一是组织技术人员学习苏联资料，学习兄弟厂应用苏联先进经验而得到的各种成就，学习报纸杂志上的苏联技术译文。在学习中，要使大家领会苏联先进经验的政治的经济的意义，防止单纯从书本上扣理论、公式、名词。要使大家了解苏联经验最大的特点是理论和实际相结合。一位技术人员说：“我深深体会到苏联先进技术中无一不照顾工人的实际操作，它真是从实践中来而又上升到理论的产物。”不把这个思想搞通，技术人员做起来就要碰钉子。开始的时候常常是生吞活剥，想完全模仿苏联的样子，机械搬运，不懂得利用我们现有条件来融会贯通，碰了钉子就会发生怀疑，于是又想再回来搬用旧的落后的方法。因此在组织技术人员学习苏联资料中，要不断地端正技术人员的思想，使他们自觉地抛弃资本主义的保守落后思想。第二步是技术人员和有经验的老工人共同研究，稳步地进行试验。这是一个比较激烈的思想斗争过程，很多人学的时候觉得什么都没有问题了，但一试验却发生了问题。这些问题的产生常是由于学习方法上的片面性所造成，如二车间开始在第一工序试验时很顺利，可是技术人员在学习苏联经验时忽视了下一工序的操作，改到下一工序时，就行不通了，这时就有人怀疑说：“我从来就没有看到过这样的做法。”后来检查才发现原来技术人员在苏联资料上修改了尺寸，用的是“老办法。”于是大家才明白苏联经验是一套完整的新东西，用落后的方法来修改是行不通的。后来按照苏联的办法改过来，终于得到成功。第三是根据试验结果，组织技术人员，老工人进行讨论。从学校出身的技术人员缺乏经验，但有一定的理论基础，可以作一些分析工作；工人出身的技术人员缺乏理论，但经验丰富，这两种人互相合作可以补短取长。他们共同研究切实可行的措施计划，把苏联经验中完全适合我们具体情况的，立刻加以运用；适当改变条件才可以用的，就订出具体的措施逐步实现；目前尚不能用的，就用以作为武器来创造一些新的办法。这样基本上可以全面实现了苏联的技术要求。五三厂技术人员思想变化的明显的标志是：一九五二年上半年只有几个人在工厂外边学习俄文，现在大家都在学，工厂专门为他们开办了俄文训练班，在十八名技术员中已有五人能够自由阅读俄文资料。过去技术资料没有一本俄文书籍，现在是放得满满的两书柜子，俄文的技术书籍成了技术人员学习苏联的精神食粮。
    发动工人掌握先进技术
    技术人员学了先进技术，如果不同工人结合起来，用一位技术人员的话说，那就“等于废物”。工人是直接生产者，他们掌握了先进技术就形成了物质力量。五三厂选择了第二和第六车间作为这次学习苏联先进技术的试验单位。试验的结果，大大推动了全厂的增产节约运动。二车间根据在第八工序的试验证明：按照苏联方法改变生产，可以作到：（一）省掉一道工序加上其他的改进措施，全车间提高劳动效率百分之十三点六三；（二）实行劳动分工专业化提高产量百分之七，节省工具百分之二十六，提高机器运用率百分之五点五；（三）减少修品百分之十二，减少修品时间百分之五十四，实行机器保养负责制可以减少机修时间百分之二点
  一。全车间生产效率到年底平均可以提高到百分之四十六点八五。
    怎样在车间工序中组织和推动工人进行试验呢？第一、领导上有意识选择生产关键（照五三厂同志解释：关键车间或工序的标准是在生产最关紧要的同时也是问题比较多的地方。）的车间和工序进行试验，试验的方法是：开工长组长训练班，由技术人员把苏联先进技术教给工长和工会组长，用新旧技术的对比方法使他们掌握住苏联技术的
  一些基本理论。工长组长训练完后，再选择关键工序由工长负责把苏联技术传授给工人，技术人员从旁协助；工长组长技术能力提高了，在工人中建立了威信，成了推广苏联技术操作方法的核心。这样作起来，容易得到成功。第二、技术人员同有经验的老工人共同组成专责小组以某一件技术改革为对象进行试验，注意挑选接近苏联操作标准的工人作为“活的样板。”这次试验苏联的操作方法，开始时，二车间大多数工人掌握不了，后来发现有一个老师傅的技术接近苏联的标准，就帮助他提高，组织他进行表演，用两个星期的时间向工人传授了他的方法，大家的技术就提高了。这是郭瓦廖夫工作法的具体运用，在一九五一年他们就使用了这个方法。当时某一工序生产废品很多，技术人员找到了一个不出废品的张喜贺，帮助他总结了经验，经过大家讨论订成了共同遵守的操作规程，消灭了废品。领导上按照实行苏联标准要求，向职工们提出主要课题，发动工人挖潜力找窍门，号召工人结合自己的经验去创造适合于我们现有条件的先进经验。同时，开展群众性的技术学习，发动工人一边讨论，一边看操作表演，自己进行练习。他们认为：只有逐步把工人技术熟练程度提高到苏联的先进水平，才能算是真正全面地学习了苏联。第三、党、工会和青年团在试验期间分头深入到群众中去了解情况，根据工人思想情况，操作技术情况和机器设备情况确定试验期间群众政治工作的重点和方法。解决工人中怕“改变生产定额、少拿计件工资”“专业化就不能全面掌握技术”等思想顾虑，及时地指出专业化的方向正是为培养各工种工人成为熟练的技术工人，同时改变计件工资奖励办法，使工人个人利益同整体利益密切结合。在试验中出现新的成绩，工会就及时进行宣传鼓动，给其他车间的工人作思想上的准备，为全面开展学习苏联技术创造条件。这次在二车间第八工序进行试验时，第五工序的工人就问：为什么我们“摊不上”，要求参加试验。职工们这种自动要求学习先进技术的思想，是全厂掌握苏联技术的成功基础。
    五三厂职工热烈地向苏联专家学习，苏联专家给他们提了很多宝贵的建议，提了他们就学习，就试验，譬如苏联专家曾提出一个提高产品质量的办法，他们不到两个星期就完全实现了。这种积极主动的学习态度是一个很好的榜样。
    全面学习苏联，已经成了五三厂今年实现增产节约计划的基本动力。
