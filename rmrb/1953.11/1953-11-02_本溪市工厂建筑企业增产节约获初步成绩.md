Benxi City's factories and construction enterprises have achieved initial successes since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. They have reversed the situation of failing to complete tasks in production and capital construction. In terms of industrial production, twenty-three of the city's twenty-nine major products, including pig iron, steel ingots, forged steel, iron ore, coke, and high-alumina cement, exceeded their targets in September. The production balance rate of general enterprises has significantly improved. Among the twenty-two major products for which the balance rate could be calculated in September, eighteen showed improvement compared to August. For example, the production balance rate for pig iron was 93.5 percent in August, reaching 99.1 percent in September; for pellet ore, it increased from 91.5 percent in August to 99.1 percent in September. Regarding the completion of product quality indicators, fifteen of the seventeen major products in the Iron and Steel Company system showed improvement compared to August. The stone content in raw coal from the Mining Bureau began to improve in early October. Local state-owned industries, focusing on improving product quality and strengthening technical management, conducted reasonable adjustments to labor organization during the production increase and economy campaign. In September, they averaged 122.59 percent completion of planned production targets. In terms of capital construction, the open-pit mine project completed 105.19 percent of its monthly plan by the end of September. In vertical shaft construction, four of the seven major projects exceeded their September plans. The progress of municipal capital construction projects has significantly improved, and the quality also meets standards.

The main reasons for the achievements in Benxi City's production increase and economy campaign are: First, after the launch of the competition, the municipal leadership organs drew more than one hundred cadres, under the unified leadership of the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, to form seven working groups to conduct specific inspections and assistance in production, capital construction, and other departments, and promptly exchange experiences, so that the competition could develop healthily. Second, most units have combined the production increase and economy competition with improving business management, promptly incorporating the production increase and economy plans into the operation plans on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. They also universally mobilized workers to formulate group guarantee plans, and combined group guarantee plans with the establishment of a worker post responsibility system, focusing on promoting the advanced experience of the post responsibility system. They checked the implementation of group plans and operation plans through production meetings, and also took improving the production balance rate as the central content of the competition, preventing the tendency of rush production. Third, after the production increase and economy plans were formulated, the masses were promptly guided to promote advanced experiences, implement expert recommendations, find shortcuts, tap potentials, and carry out mechanization and automation movements and other technical reform work. According to incomplete statistics from production factories and mines, employees have proposed 1,371 major rationalization proposals and more than one hundred mechanization and automation schemes, most of which have been put into reconstruction plans, and some have been successfully created. Each unit has focused on promoting decisive advanced experiences based on its specific situation. Fourth, in order to further mobilize technical personnel to actively participate in technical reform work and ensure the completion of production increase and economy tasks, the city held a citywide representative conference of engineering and technical personnel in early October, organized different types of symposiums, summarized past work, inspected the implementation of expert recommendations, the implementation of the policy of combining labor and technology, and the promotion of advanced experiences. Typical reports were organized at the conference, and commendations and rewards were given to establish benchmarks. Three resolutions were made at the conference: to implement expert recommendations, to implement the policy of combining labor and technology, and to promote advanced experiences to comprehensively and overfulfill the annual task. At present, all units are organizing the transmission and implementation of these resolutions. Generally, technical personnel feel that the leadership values ​​and trusts them, and they all expressed that they will conscientiously implement the conference resolutions in their practical work and strive to complete the production increase and economy tasks ahead of schedule. Fifth, further education on the significance of increasing production and practicing economy was conducted among the workers and masses, and education on consolidating labor discipline was emphasized, strengthening labor discipline and increasing attendance rates. For example, taking the attendance rate of production workers in August as 100, the attendance rate of the Iron and Steel Company in September was 101, and the attendance rate of the Coal Mining Bureau was 101.5. The strengthening of labor discipline and the increase in attendance rates greatly helped the completion of production and capital construction tasks. Sixth, at the beginning of the production increase and economy campaign, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically studied the coordination of the work of administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and women's federation departments. Under the overall arrangement of the Municipal Committee, the administrative organs carried out work centering on improving enterprise business management. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League focused on holding representative meetings of technical personnel and management personnel and promoting advanced experiences and launching competitions. The Women's Federation conducted in-depth work among the families of employees. All departments and committees of the Municipal Committee also carried out work around the production increase and economy campaign.

Currently, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to the shortcomings and key links existing in the production increase and economy campaign, has decided to further strengthen specific leadership work and is preparing to take the following measures: First, to further mobilize cadres in production, capital construction, and other units, requiring them to combine production increase and economy more closely with improving enterprise business management. Second, to hold a conference soon to reward rationalization proposals, promote advanced experiences, implement expert recommendations, and further carry out the mechanization and automation movement in order to promote technical reform work and further improve and implement the technical responsibility system. Third, to improve the work of the departments by opposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible and establishing a responsibility system, to further implement operation plans and give full play to their guiding role. Fourth, to convene a security inspection mobilization conference at the end of October to further implement the policy of safe production in order to ensure the smooth development of the production increase and economy campaign.

    本溪市工厂建筑企业增产节约获初步成绩
    本溪市工厂、建筑企业自开展增产节约运动以来已获初步成绩，在生产、基本建设等方面都扭转了完不成任务的局面。在工业生产方面，全市二十九种主要产品在九月份有生铁、钢锭、锻钢材、铁矿、焦炭、高炉水泥等二十三种超额完成了任务。一般的企业生产均衡率都有了显著的提高。九月份仅在能计算出均衡率的二十二种主要产品中，已有十八种产品较八月份有所提高。如生铁八月份生产均衡率为百分之九十三点五，而九月份则达到百分之九十九点一；团矿八月份为九十一点五，而九月份则为九十九点一。在完成产品质量指标方面，钢铁公司系统十七种主要产品中，有十五种产品比八月份有了提高。矿务局原煤含石率，十月上旬已开始好转。地方国营工业在增产节约竞赛中，以改进产品质量、加强技术管理为中心，进行了合理的调整劳动组织工作。九月份在产量上平均完成了计划指标的百分之一百二十二点五九。在基本建设方面，九月末露天矿工程完成了月计划的百分之一百零五点一九，竖井建设方面，七项主要工程中有四项超额完成了九月份的计划。市政基本建设工程进度有显著提高，质量也合乎标准。
    该市增产节约运动获得上述成绩的主要原因是：一、竞赛发动起来之后，市级领导机关曾抽调一百多名干部，在中共本溪市委统一领导下，组成七个工作组，分别到生产、基本建设等部门进行具体检查和帮助，及时交流经验，使竞赛得到健康地发展。二、大部分单位将增产节约竞赛与改进经营管理工作结合得较好，及时将增产节约计划按月、按旬、按日地纳入到作业计划里去，同时普遍地发动工人制订了小组保证计划，并把小组保证计划与建立工人岗位责任制结合起来，重点推广了岗位责任制的先进经验，通过生产会议的形式检查小组计划与作业计划执行情况；又把提高生产均衡率作为竞赛的中心内容，防止了突击生产的偏向。三、增产节约计划制订之后，及时将群众引向推广先进经验、贯彻专家建议、找窍门、挖潜力、开展机械化自动化运动等技术改革工作方面去。目前仅据生产厂矿不完全统计，职工已提出较大的合理化建议一千三百七十一件，提出机械化自动化的方案已有百余件，其中大部已订出改造计划，有的已创造成功。各单位根据不同情况，着重推广了带决定性的先进经验。四、为了进一步发动技术人员积极参加技术改革工作，保证增产节约任务的完成，该市于十月上旬召开了全市工程技术人员代表会议，组织了不同类型的座谈会，总结了过去的工作，检查了贯彻专家建议、贯彻劳动与技术相结合的方针和推广先进经验的情况，在会上组织了典型报告，并进行表扬奖励，树立了旗帜。在会上作出了贯彻专家建议，贯彻劳动与技术结合的方针，推广先进经验以全面超额完成全年任务的三项决议。目前各单位正组织传达与贯彻执行。一般技术人员感到领导上重视他们，信任他们，都表示要在实际工作中认真贯彻会议决议，争取提前完成增产节约任务。五、进一步向职工群众进行了增产节约意义的教育，并着重进行了巩固劳动纪律的教育，加强了劳动纪律，提高了出勤率。如以八月份生产工人出勤率为一百，九月份钢铁公司出勤率为一百零一，煤矿局出勤率为一百零一点五。劳动纪律的加强与出勤率的提高，大大有助于生产与基本建设任务的完成。六、在增产节约运动开始时，中共本溪市委专门研究了行政、工会、青年团、妇联各部门工作的配合问题。在市委总的布置下，行政机关以改进企业经营管理为中心展开工作，市总工会、青年团市委着重进行技术人员与管理人员代表会议和推广先进经验、发动竞赛的工作，妇联则深入地进行了职工家属的工作。市委各部、委也都围绕着增产节约运动展开工作。
    目前中共本溪市委针对增产节约运动中所存在的缺点与关键环节，决定进一步加强具体领导工作，准备采取以下几项措施：一、向生产、基本建设等单位的干部作进一步的动员工作，要求把增产节约与改进企业经营管理更加密切结合起来。二、在最近召开一次奖励合理化建议、推广先进经验、贯彻专家建议与进一步开展机械化自动化运动的大会，以便推动技术改革工作，进一步健全与贯彻技术责任制。三、从反对无人负责现象、建立责任制度方面改进科室工作，进一步贯彻作业计划，充分发挥其应起的指导作用。四、在十月底召开保安检查动员大会，进一步贯彻安全生产的方针，以保证增产节约运动顺利开展。
