    The First Day of the National Ethnic Sports Games
    The first day of the National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition was the 8th, and more than 24,000 spectators watched the athletes' wonderful performances with excitement.
    The performance items on the 8th included Wushu, folk sports, equestrian skills (including light riding, slashing, and obstacle), and the competition items included boxing, wrestling, fencing, weightlifting, and archery. The Wushu item alone had 58 performances. Among them were the Eight Directions Sword performed by Zhang Zhibin, an eight-year-old athlete from the Northeast Region, and the Broadsword performed by Zhang Tengjiao, a seventy-seven-year-old athlete from the Southwest Region. There was Sidi Ke, a Uygur athlete from the Northwest Region, performing rope walking; Li Yishun and others, Korean athletes from the Northeast Region, performing the springboard; Gu Xiaozong, a Miao athlete from the Southwest Region, performing the Hulusi dance; and Mongolian athletes from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the People's Liberation Army performing equestrian skills, and Mongolian athletes from the North China Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region performing wrestling.
    Sidi Ke, a Uygur athlete from the Northwest Region, performing rope walking was one of the most popular programs among the audience. Dressed in a bright red national costume, he walked from one end of a rope that was 20 meters high and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the ground, to the top. He moved calmly forward and backward on the thin and trembling rope, and performed complex movements such as "shoulder stand" and "golden rooster independence" on the rope. He then blindfolded himself and walked back and forth on the rope, suddenly fell, and deftly straddled the rope. The audience continuously exclaimed in admiration and applauded warmly for his skillful and thrilling movements and superb skills. Rope walking is a sports activity that can cultivate people's courage and resourcefulness.
    In the Wushu performance, the Mianquan performed by Lan Suzhen, a female athlete from the Southwest Region, aroused great interest among the audience. The Mianquan she performed concentrated many beautiful high-level movements in Wushu such as balance, rotation, splits, somersaults, and single-leg standing, and she combined these movements with dance movements, which were more beautiful, giving people a pleasant, soft, and light feeling.
    The folk sports item – the springboard, performed by Li Yishun, Quan Jingzi, Zheng Chenxing, and Xu Chunlian, female Korean athletes from the Northeast Region, was also welcomed by the audience. The springboard is a sports activity loved by the Korean people and has a long history of more than 1,000 years. Korean women have been engaged in this sport since they were five or six years old. The springboard can exercise the body's balance and jumping ability. Li Yishun and other four athletes showed their superb skills in the performance, with athletes leaping at both ends of the springboard, jumping up to three meters high, and making various beautiful movements in the air. The results of the wrestling, fencing, weightlifting, and boxing competitions held on the 8th were: In the lightweight wrestling group competition, Lan Shuming from the Northeast Region, Song Baosheng from the East China Region, Wang Dianyuan from the Northeast Region, Zhang Hairong from the North China Region, Zhou Fenggen from the East China Region, Zhang Junsheng from the Railway, and Shen Shao San from the Central South Region won; Middleweight: Tan Shusen from the East China Region and Ma Qingzong from the Railway won; Light heavyweight: Bian Fuchen from the Northeast Region and Du Keqin from the Central South Region won.

    八日大会上进行表演的项目有武术、民间体育、骑术（包括轻乘、斩劈、障碍）和竞赛项目拳击、摔跤、击剑、举重、步射。武术一项即进行了五十八项次表演。其中有东北区八岁运动员张植滨表演的八方刀，也有西南区七十七岁运动员张腾蛟表演的大刀。有西北区维吾尔族运动员司的克表演的踩绳，有东北区朝鲜族运动员李乙顺等表演的跳板，有西南区苗族运动员古小宗表演的葫芦笙舞，还有内蒙古自治区和解放军代表队的蒙古族运动员表演的马术和华北区、内蒙古自治区蒙古族运动员表演的摔跤。
    西北区维吾尔族运动员司的克表演的踩绳是最受观众欢迎的节目之一。他穿着一身鲜红的富有民族色彩的服装，在一根顶端高达二十公尺，与地面倾斜约成四十五度角的绳子上，从地面的一端，走向顶端，他在细而颤动的绳子上从容的前进后退，并在绳子上做“肩倒立”、“金鸡独立”等复杂动作。他又用布蒙住了眼睛，在绳子上来回地走着，突然下落，两腿轻巧地骑在绳子上，观众们都为他的熟练而惊险的动作和高超的技巧不断发出赞叹的欢呼和热烈的鼓掌。踩绳是一种能锻炼人们勇敢而机智的体育活动。
