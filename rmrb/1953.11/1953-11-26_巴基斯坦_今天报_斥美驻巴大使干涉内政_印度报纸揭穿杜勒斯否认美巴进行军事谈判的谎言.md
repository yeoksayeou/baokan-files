Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, November 21st (Tass): According to "Today's News," the US Ambassador to Pakistan, Mr. Hildreth, currently visiting East Pakistan, expressed surprise in a conversation that Pakistanis "too frequently criticize" their own government. Commenting on the US Ambassador's remarks, the newspaper wrote: "We want to make it clear to Mr. Hildreth that the people of Pakistan can no longer tolerate his interference. The people of Pakistan struggled against British imperialism for over two hundred years. They are well aware of the ingrained habits of imperialism and will not allow American imperialism to take root in Pakistani soil."

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: According to the Indian News Service: the "Amrita Bazar Patrika" on the 22nd considered US Secretary of State Dulles' denial of negotiations between the US and Pakistan to establish military bases as "guarded to the point of being unsettling."

The newspaper said: "The secret preliminary talks between Karachi and Washington over the past year or so have now come to light, culminating in the recent talks between the US President and the Governor-General of Pakistan. These secret preliminary talks make it certain that the State Department also agreed to a military agreement with Pakistan.

"Due to the disastrous failure of the Middle East Defense Plan and the unstable political situation in Iran, the United States is even more in need of turning its attention to Pakistan and Turkey, regarding them as the most suitable replacements to fill the missing links in the chain of military bases extending from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Under these general circumstances, the remarks made by Dulles or President Eisenhower on this issue can only be regarded as words to divert people's attention."

The newspaper pointed out that this American policy "will absolutely not contribute to world peace and the economic development of backward countries in Asia"; and, "the planned military alliance with Pakistan will inevitably affect the relationship between Pakistan and India."

    巴基斯坦“今天报”斥美驻巴大使干涉内政
    印度报纸揭穿杜勒斯否认美巴进行军事谈判的谎言
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩二十一日电：据“今天报”消息，现正在东巴基斯坦访问的美国大使希尔德莱斯在他的一次谈话中对巴基斯坦人“太经常地批评”自己的政府感到奇怪。该报在谈到美国大使的这篇谈话时写道：“我们要向希尔德莱斯明白表示，巴基斯坦人民不能再容忍他的干涉了。巴基斯坦人民对英国帝国主义作了二百余年的斗争。他们很了解帝国主义的积习，因此不会让美国帝国主义在巴基斯坦的土地上生根。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】据印度新闻处报道：二十二日的“甘露市场报”认为美国国务卿杜勒斯否认美国和巴基斯坦进行建立军事基地的谈判的谈话是“有保留的，以致不能令人安心”。
    该报说：“喀喇蚩和华盛顿在过去一年或更长的时间中进行的秘密预备会谈现在已经大白于世，而以美国总统和巴基斯坦总督最近举行的会谈为顶点。这种秘密预备会谈使人确信国务院肯定也是同意和巴基斯坦签订军事协定的。
    “由于中东防御计划惨遭失败，同时伊朗政治局势很不稳定，因而美国更加需要把目标转向巴基斯坦和土耳其，把它们当作最合适的替换物，以弥补从太平洋延伸到大西洋的军事基地锁链中所缺少的环节。在这种总的情况下，杜勒斯或艾森豪威尔总统就这个问题发表的谈话只能被看作是转移人们注意力的词令而已。”
    该报指出：美国的这种政策“绝对不会有助于世界和平及亚洲落后国家的经济发展”；并且，“计划中的和巴基斯坦缔结的军事同盟也必然会影响巴基斯坦和印度的关系。”
