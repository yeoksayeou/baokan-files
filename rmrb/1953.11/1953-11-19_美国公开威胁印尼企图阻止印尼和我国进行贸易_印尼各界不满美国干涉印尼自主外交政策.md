Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th: As the Indonesian government sends an economic delegation to the People's Republic of China to promote normal trade relations between the two countries, US government officials publicly make remarks threatening the Indonesian government. Indonesian parliamentarians and others are dissatisfied and indignant at this blatant interference by the United States.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported: Indonesian Deputy Speaker of Parliament Arudji, commenting on the US blackmail of Indonesia with the cessation of "aid" to prevent it from selling rubber to China, said: "Indonesia's sale of rubber to the People's Republic of China is based on the situation and prospects of rubber merchants, and it is also the right and obligation of Indonesia's independent foreign policy; the relationship between Indonesia and New China is 100% Indonesia's own business." Arudji also said: "Foreign aid, no matter where it comes from, cannot be used as a mortgage for the country."

Xiao Yu Can, of the Indonesian Parliament's Economic Subcommittee, pointed out that Indonesia, facing economic difficulties, has reason to "take various steps to save itself." "The United States' use of this threat proves that US aid has always contained political constraints, and therefore, it is contrary to Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy." Lundu Nuwu, a member of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said that the rubber and tin tragedy brought to Indonesia by the United States is in fact the same as implementing a war decree against Indonesia.

Indonesian public opinion also expressed its intolerance of the rogue tactics of the United States. "Independent Daily" published an editorial on the 9th saying that Indonesia, in the current situation of difficult production and sales, cannot tolerate the sale of raw materials being bound by warlike "decrees".

    印尼各界不满美国干涉印尼自主外交政策
   【新华社十八日讯】雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚政府派遣经济代表团到中华人民共和国以促进两国之间的正常贸易关系的时候，美国政府官员公开发表威胁印尼政府的言论。印尼国会人士等对于美国的这种横蛮干涉，感到不满和愤慨。
    印尼“人民日报”报道：印尼国会副议长阿鲁齐对于美国以停止给印尼“援助”来要挟印尼不卖橡胶给中国一事发表谈话说：“印尼卖橡胶给中华人民共和国是根据橡胶商人的处境和出路出发，这也是印尼独立自主外交政策的权利和义务；印尼和新中国的关系百分之百是印尼自己的事。”阿鲁齐并说：“外国的援助不论来自何方，都不能以国家作为抵押品。”
    印尼国会经济小组委员会的萧玉灿指出：遭遇经济困难的印尼，有理由“采取各种步骤以自救”。“美国使用这种威胁，证明美国给予援助一向含有政治束缚的意味，因此，这是和印尼的积极自主外交政策相抵触的”。印尼国会外交小组委员伦度诺乌说：美国给印尼带来的橡胶和锡的悲剧，事实上已经和对印尼施行战争法令一样。
    印尼的舆论也对美国的无赖手段表示不堪容忍。“独立报”九日发表社论说：印尼在目前产销困难的情况下，不能容忍原料出售受到战争性的“法令”束缚。
