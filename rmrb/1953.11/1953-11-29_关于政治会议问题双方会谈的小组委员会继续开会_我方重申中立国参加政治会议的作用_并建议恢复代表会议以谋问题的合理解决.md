Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the talks on the political conference issue issued the following communique:

On November 28th, the two subcommittees of the talks on the political conference issue held their tenth meeting.

    In the subcommittee discussing the first agenda item, our representative, Mr. Qi Shifu, continued to demand that the other side express a clear attitude on the issue of whether neutral nations should participate in the political conference and refuted the so-called eleven understandings proposed by the other side yesterday. Mr. Qi Shifu pointed out that although the other side agreed that the political conference should take a form of equality between the two sides, they simultaneously described the Soviet Union as belonging to our side. This is completely untrue and interferes with our principle of independently determining participating countries. We resolutely cannot agree. This shows that although the other side agrees in form to a conference of equality between the two sides, in substance, it opposes handling matters according to the form of a conference of equality between the two sides.

    The other side agreed that all issues in the political conference should be voted on based on the principle of consensus between the two sides. However, on the one hand, it proposed that each country participating in the political conference should only be bound by agreements it agrees to. On the other hand, it advocated that each side should vote as a unit. These two propositions of the other side are clearly contradictory. We believe that according to the principle of voting based on mutual consent, in the voting procedure, each country participating on both sides should still vote and express its opinion individually. Only when all governments participating on both sides unanimously agree can a true consensus be achieved. The other side's proposition that each side vote as a unit is clearly an attempt by a single country on one side to monopolize the voting rights of the other countries on that side. We cannot agree to this approach.

    Regarding the central issue of neutral nations participating in the political conference, the other side is still attempting to prevaricate and avoid answering. The other side stated that if non-voting observers are invited to attend the political conference, they will not enjoy all the normal rights of members of the political conference. This proposition completely fails to resolve the central issue of neutral nations participating in the political conference. We believe that since both sides have agreed to the form of a conference of equality between the two sides and the principle of voting by mutual consent, and since both sides will determine the agenda of the political conference in these talks, it is entirely necessary for neutral nations participating in the political conference to freely express their opinions on each item on the agreed agenda. Only in this way will the participation of neutral nations in the political conference be meaningful. They can provide beneficial opinions, reflect fair world opinion, promote agreements between the two sides, and prevent the political conference from reaching a deadlock, which is conducive to the progress of the political conference. Since both sides have agreed to the principle of voting by mutual consent, if the two sides have already reached a consensus on a certain issue, then any dissenting opinion from a neutral nation is invalid. Therefore, the participation of neutral nations in the political conference does not play a decisive role in the voting. Therefore, we advocate that neutral nations should participate in all activities of the political conference as members of the political conference. This is entirely in line with the peaceful wishes of the broad masses of people in the world. Regarding this central issue, unless the other side is deliberately delaying, it should no longer prevaricate and refuse to express its attitude.

    The US representative put forward so-called twelve suggestions, but still refused to state its attitude on the central issue of neutral nations participating in the political conference. On the one hand, the other side continues to deny the neutral status of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it remains ambiguous, repeating its old tune of inviting some countries as non-voting observers to attend the political conference under layers of restrictions. In essence, this proposition is still equivalent to refusing the participation of neutral nations.

    In view of the fact that the other side is still adopting an unreasonable attitude of prevarication and procrastination on the central issue of neutral nations participating in the political conference; and in view of the fact that the other side has once again rejected our reasonable suggestions in the subcommittee discussing the time issue, our representative believes that it is no longer necessary to continue holding subcommittee meetings and suggests that the next meeting resume the meeting of the two delegations to seek a reasonable resolution to the issue, and stated that our side will propose a suggestion at the meeting of the two delegations, requesting the other side to agree.

    The other side agreed to our suggestion to convene a meeting of the two delegations next Monday.

    In his speech today, the US representative arrogantly threatened our side with the so-called military strength of the United States when requesting our side to consider his so-called twelve suggestions. Our representative, Mr. Huang Hua, immediately refuted this sharply, pointing out that the Korean-Chinese side has always advocated resolving all international disputes through peaceful consultation and opposes resorting to acts of war. But if anyone dares to threaten us with military strength, then he will definitely be severely attacked by us and will be badly bruised.

    关于政治会议问题双方会谈的小组委员会继续开会
    我方重申中立国参加政治会议的作用
    并建议恢复代表会议以谋问题的合理解决
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十八日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第十次会议。
    在讨论第一项议程的小组委员会中，我方代表奇石福先生继续要求对方对中立国是否参加政治会议的问题表示明确态度，并对对方昨日提出的所谓十一项谅解加以驳斥。奇石福先生指出，对方同意政治会议应该采取双方对等的形式，但同时却把苏联说成是属于我方，这完全不是事实，同时是干预我方自行规定参加国家的原则，我们断然不能同意。这说明对方在形式上虽然同意了双方对等会议，但实质上却又反对按照双方对等会议的形式办事。
    对方同意在政治会议中一切问题应该根据双方一致协议的原则进行表决，但一面提出参加政治会议的各个国家只受其同意的协议的约束，同时又主张每方要当作一个单位来投票。对方这两个主张显然是互相矛盾的。我们认为根据双方一致同意进行表决的原则，但在表决的程序上，双方参加的各个国家仍然应该各自投票表示意见，只有当双方参加的各国政府一致同意了，才能取得真正的双方一致的协议。对方主张各方作为一个单位来投票，显然是企图以一方的某一个国家，来垄断该方其他国家的表决权，我们不能同意这种办法。
    关于中立国参加政治会议的中心问题，对方仍然企图闪烁其词，避不答复。对方表示如果邀请不投票的观察员出席政治会议，它们将不能享有政治会议成员的一切正常权利，这种主张是完全不能解决关于中立国家应该参加政治会议的中心问题的。我们认为双方既然同意了双方对等会议的形式和双方一致同意的表决原则，而双方又将在此次会谈中确定政治会议的议程，那么，参加政治会议的中立国，对双方协议的议程上的各个项目自由发表意见，是完全必要的。只有这样，中立国参加政治会议才有意义，它们才可以提供有益意见，反映世界公正舆论，推动双方取得协议，并避免政治会议陷入僵局，以利政治会议的进行。既然双方同意了双方一致协议的表决原则，如果双方对于某一问题已经取得一致同意，则任何一个中立国纵有不同意见，也是无效的。因此，在表决问题上，中立国的参加政治会议是不起决定作用的。因此，我们主张中立国应该作为政治会议的成员，全面参加政治会议的活动，这是完全符合于广大世界人民的和平愿望的。对于这个中心问题，对方如非蓄意拖延，就不应再闪烁其词，拒绝表示态度。
    美方代表提出了所谓十二点建议，但对中立国参加政治会议的中心问题，仍拒不表明态度。对方一面继续否定苏联的中立国的地位，另一面则仍然含糊其词，重复其邀请一些国家作为不投票的观察员，在层层限制之下出席政治会议的老调。对方这种主张实质上仍然是等于拒绝中立国参加。
    我方代表鉴于对方对中立国参加政治会议的这个中心问题仍然采取闪烁其词，拖延时日的无理态度；同时鉴于对方在讨论时间问题的小组上，也再次拒绝我方合理建议，我方认为继续举行小组会议已无必要，建议下次会议恢复双方代表会议，以谋取问题的合理解决，并表示我方将在双方代表会上提出建议，要求对方同意。
    对方同意我方建议下星期一召开双方代表会议。
    美方代表在今日发言中，要求我方考虑其所谓十二点建议时，竟狂妄地以美国的所谓军事力量相威胁。我方代表黄华先生当即痛加驳斥，指出朝中方面一贯主张以和平协商的方法解决一切国际争端，而反对诉诸战争行为，但如有人胆敢以军事力量相威胁，那么他一定会遭到我们的痛击，而碰得头破血流。
