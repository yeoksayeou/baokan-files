　　Tianjin Municipal State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories Extensively Launch Literary and Artistic Activities to Promote Increased Production and Thrift
　　To cooperate with the movement of increased production and thrift, the amateur art organizations and clubs of various state-owned and local state-owned factories in Tianjin are extensively launching various literary and artistic propaganda activities. The dozens of creative writing groups, ballad singing groups, drama groups, art groups, and singing teams of the six state-owned Tianjin cotton textile factories have created and arranged many kuaiban (clapper talk), xiangsheng (comic dialogue), songs, short plays, dances, and yangpian (shadow plays) that promote increased production and thrift. They are performed during workers' pre-shift, post-shift, and rest times. These works not only promote the significance of increasing production and practicing thrift and introduce advanced figures, advanced groups, and inventions, but also include works that criticize conservative and backward thinking. Some workers in the old cloth field of the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, who could not complete their production plans well, complained that the yarn was not good and there were too many breaks, and did not examine their own shortcomings at work. The factory's creative writing group wrote the Shandong Kuaishu (Shandong Clapper Talk) "Qi Huiying", which praised Qi Huiying, a worker who actively learned technology and completed her plans on time, and criticized those conservative and backward thoughts. This work was performed in the workshop during rest time and received good results. The Tianjin Textile Workers' Union held a city-wide textile workers' art performance, which featured more than 40 programs such as the drama "For Increased Production and Thrift" and the dance "Fine Yarn Workers' Dance." The broadcasting stations of various factories in Tianjin have also actively launched propaganda activities, using dialogues, kuaiban (clapper talk), xiangsheng (comic dialogue) and other forms to promote the significance of increased production and thrift and introduce advanced figures and advanced deeds to inspire workers' enthusiasm for labor. In addition, the Tianjin First Workers' Cultural Palace has also held reports, lectures, and exhibitions to cooperate with increased production and thrift. More than 20 reports and lectures have now been held.

    天津市许多国营和地方国营工厂广泛展开宣传增产节约的文艺活动
    天津市国营和地方国营各工厂的业余文艺组织和俱乐部为配合增产节约，正广泛展开各种文艺宣传活动。国营天津六个棉纺织厂的几十个创作组、曲艺组、话剧组、美术组和歌咏队等已经创作和编排了许多配合增产节约的快板、相声、歌曲、短剧、舞蹈、洋片等，利用工人上班前、下班后和休息时间演出。在这些创作中，除了宣传增产节约的意义和介绍先进人物、先进小组和创造发明外，还有批判保守、落后思想的作品。国营天津第二棉纺织厂老布场的打轴间有的工人不能很好地完成生产计划就埋怨纱不好用，断头多，也不检查自己工作上的缺点。该厂创作组就编写了山东快书“齐慧英”，一方面表扬积极学习技术、按期完成计划的工人齐慧英，一方面批判那些保守落后的思想。这一作品在车间利用休息时间演出，收到很好的效果。天津市纺织工会举行了全市纺织工人文艺会演，演出了话剧“为了增产节约”、舞蹈“细纱工人舞”等四十多个节目。天津市各厂的广播站也都积极展开宣传活动，利用对话、快板、相声等形式宣传增产节约的意义和介绍先进人物、先进事迹，鼓舞工人的劳动热情。此外，天津第一工人文化宫也为配合增产节约举办了报告会、讲座、展览会。现在报告会和讲座已经举办了二十多次。
