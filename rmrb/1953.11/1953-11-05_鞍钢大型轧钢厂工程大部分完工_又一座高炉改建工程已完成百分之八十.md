Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd. Following the completion and handover to the production departments of the seamless steel tube plant, the completion date of the large rolling mill, which is larger in scale than the seamless steel tube plant, is also approaching. Most of the construction and installation work has been completed, and local test runs and acceptance work are being accelerated.

Currently, most of the machines in the heating furnace area of the large rolling mill have been initially accepted and handed over to the production units. Dozens of production personnel wearing symbols have taken up their positions. With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, they are stepping up their practice of operating techniques. Liu Jiaqi, the section chief who has just returned from the Soviet Union after interning in modern rolling production technology, issued the order to start practicing production. A worker standing on the control panel pressed a button, and a cold steel billet weighing more than two tons was pulled over from the primary rolling mill. As soon as it was pulled onto the roller table, the roller table quickly rotated, sending it into the heating furnace. Subsequently, the steel billet came out of the heating furnace and moved toward the rolling mill area. In the rolling mill area, the test operation of the roller table and lifting platform is nearing completion, and it will soon be handed over to the production unit. The test operation of the huge rolling mill can be started in the next week or two. If the rolling mill is running, it can be prepared for baking the furnace.

This mechanized and automated large rolling mill requires many complex and large-scale electrical equipment. Now the installation of these electrical equipment has been largely completed, and the electrical adjustment work is being carried out intensively. After helping to complete the electrical adjustment work of the seamless steel tube plant, Soviet expert Radoshev is using all his energy to guide the workers of the large rolling mill to adjust the most complex main drive distribution panel (ie, the main switch). The large motor connecting the two DC generators has started, and soon another giant motor can drive the rolling mill.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the large rolling mill project, political work is being vigorously carried out on the construction site during the completion period. According to the characteristics of the completion period, the CCP Steelmaking Engineering Company Committee transferred eleven party and mass work cadres, led by the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, to go deep into the various construction units to carry out publicity work. They repeatedly explained to cadres and workers the great significance of strengthening the overall concept for striving for early completion, so that the construction units and production units can more actively cooperate with each other to carry out work. The Basic Construction Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also sent cadres to go deep into the construction site to carry out political work.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th. Another blast furnace reconstruction project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been 80 percent completed. The bricklaying project of the blast furnace body has been completed ahead of schedule, and the main mechanical equipment and electrical equipment have also been installed ahead of schedule. The hoist weighing one hundred tons and thirty-five meters high has started trial operation, and the one hundred and eighty illuminating lamps and seventeen light transceivers of the furnace body have emitted brilliance. The auxiliary works of the blast furnace—most of the steel frame of the huge steam boiler, the heating furnace, and the hot blast stove—have been installed ahead of schedule. The No. 1 blower is about to be put into trial operation, and the No. 2 blower will also be completed soon. The No. 15 and 16 coking oven projects that supply coke to this blast furnace have begun to bake the furnace.

In order to strive for the early tapping of this blast furnace, the workers who rebuilt the blast furnace are working intensively on various unfinished projects. The furnace body of the blast furnace is filled with workers of various types of work. They are implementing three-dimensional parallel operations to enable various tasks to be carried out simultaneously. Dozens of red flags for increasing production and practicing economy inserted on the blast furnace are waving in the wind, inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for labor. At the beginning of October, a detailed balancing work was carried out for the entire project of this blast furnace, which solved the problem of imbalance in equipment and construction progress, and a completion plan was made according to the iron tapping date. This has played a great role in accelerating the progress of the project. For example, the main electrical engineering that could not be completed on time and affected the power transmission for the production of this blast furnace, after this balancing, quickly caught up with the progress of the plan. The foundation pouring project of the second pig iron casting machine was originally to take more than two months to complete, but after this balancing and the efforts of the workers, it was completed in only one month. This created conditions for the early construction of mechanical installation, electrical installation, and industrial pipeline projects.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂工程大部分完工
    又一座高炉改建工程已完成百分之八十
    【新华社鞍山三日电】继无缝钢管厂完工移交生产部门后，比无缝钢管厂规模更大的大型轧钢厂竣工的日子也日益临近了，大部分建筑安装工程已经完工，局部试车和验收工作正在加速进行。
    现在，大型轧钢厂加热炉区域绝大部分的机器已经初步验收移交给生产单位。数十个佩带着符号的生产人员已走上岗位。他们在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，正在加紧练习操作技术。刚从苏联实习近代化轧钢生产技术归来的工段长刘家畦，发出了开始练习生产的号令。站在操纵台上的工人一按电钮，两吨多重的冷钢坯就由初轧厂那边拉过来了。刚被拉到辊道上，辊道就迅速转动起来，把它送进加热炉。随后钢坯又从加热炉出来向轧钢机区域前进。在轧钢机区域，辊道和升降台的试运转工作快要结束了，不久就可移交给生产单位。巨大的轧钢机的试运转工作可在最近一两个星期内开始。如果轧钢机运转起来，就可准备烘炉了。
    这座机械化自动化的大型轧钢工厂，需要有许多复杂而庞大的电气设备。现在这些电气设备的安装工程大体上已经完工，电气调整工作正在紧张地进行。苏联专家拉多谢夫帮助完成了无缝钢管厂的电气调整工作后，正以全部精力指导大型轧钢厂的工人调整最复杂的主传动配电盘（即总开关）。连接着两座直流发电机的大马达已开始启动，不久，另一个巨型的马达就可以把轧钢机带动起来。
    为了保证大型轧钢厂工程的胜利竣工，工地上正在大力展开竣工时期的政治工作。根据竣工时期的特点，中共炼钢工程公司委员会抽调了十一个党和群众工作的干部，由党委副书记亲自领导，深入到各施工单位展开宣传工作。他们向干部和工人反复说明加强整体观念对争取提前竣工的重大意义，使各施工单位和生产单位能更主动地互相配合，进行工作。中共鞍山市委员会基本建设部、鞍山市总工会也派出干部，深入工地进行政治工作。
      【新华社鞍山四日电】鞍山钢铁公司又一个高炉的改建工程已完成百分之八十。高炉本体的砌砖工程已经提前竣工，主要的机械设备、电气设备也都提前安装完毕。一百吨重、三十五公尺高的卷扬机已开始试运转，炉体的一百八十盏照明灯和十七盏透光器已发射出了光辉。高炉的附属工程——巨大的蒸气锅炉的大部分钢架和加热炉、热风炉等都已提前安装完工。一号鼓风机即将试运转，二号鼓风机也快要完工。供给这个高炉焦炭的十五、十六号炼焦炉工程已开始烘炉。
    为了争取这个高炉提前出铁，改建高炉的职工们正在紧张地进行各种未完工程。高炉炉体上站满了各种工种的工人，他们正在实行立体平行作业，使各种工作都能同时进行。插在高炉上几十面增产节约竞赛的红旗迎风招展，鼓舞着工人们的劳动热情。十月初，这个高炉全部工程曾进行了一次细致的平衡工作，解决了设备和施工进度不平衡的问题，并根据出铁日期做出了竣工计划。这对加速工程进度起了很大作用。如过去不能按期竣工和影响这个高炉生产送电的主要电气工程，经过这次平衡，很快地就赶上计划的进度。第二铸铁机的基础浇灌工程本来要两个多月才能完成，经过这次平衡和职工们的努力，只用了一个月就完成了。从而给机械安装、电气安装、工业管道工程提前施工创造了条件。
