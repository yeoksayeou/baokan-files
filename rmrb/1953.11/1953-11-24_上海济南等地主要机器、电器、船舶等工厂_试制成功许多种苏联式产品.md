In order to meet the needs of the motherland's large-scale economic construction, major heavy industrial factories in Shanghai, Jinan, and other places have begun this year, under the unified design of the central government, to manufacture many excellent products according to Soviet standards in a planned way, and have saved a lot of valuable materials in the manufacturing process.

According to incomplete statistics, factories will trial-produce nearly a hundred kinds of Soviet-style products this year, including heavy-duty machine tools, transformers, motors, generators, boilers, ships, welding machines, switches, and various wires and cables. Among them, the main products that have been trial-produced include a 9-meter gantry planer, a 320-ampere 9.6-kilowatt DC welding machine, a 4-ton boiler, an oil-poor switch, a 1,000-ton deck cargo barge, and more than 30 kinds of sulfur-free rubber insulated wire, etc. Other more complex products such as surface grinders (one of the machine tools), complete electrical control equipment for 4-meter gantry planers, 14 to 200-kilowatt motors, 100 to 1,000-kilovolt-ampere transformers, 440-kilovolt-ampere generators, and telephone cables that can allow 1,200 pairs of telephones to talk simultaneously will also be trial-produced successively within the year. This marks a new increase in the production of means of production of paramount importance as the country enters a period of planned economic construction.

The performance and effectiveness of these trial-produced Soviet-style products exceed those manufactured by European and American capitalist countries. The Soviet-style 9-meter gantry planer, a heavy-duty machine tool capable of processing large parts, although composed of 6,193 parts and weighing 56 tons, has all the movements of its components controlled by electricity when it is started, making it very convenient to operate. It can adjust the cutting speed and feed rate at any time according to the different requirements of the workpiece. This is not comparable to British and American planers. The Soviet-style DC welding machine, mainly used to connect steel bar structures to replace rivets in buildings, is 5% more efficient than the British and American styles, and its utilization rate is 25% higher. A rubber wire with a voltage of 220 volts and a cross-section of 1 square millimeter manufactured according to the old standard can only pass 5 amperes of current, while a sulfur-free heat-resistant rubber insulated wire manufactured according to the Soviet standard can pass 15 amperes of current. That is to say, one Soviet-style wire can replace three old-style wires when in use. A Soviet-style 4-ton boiler can evaporate 4 tons of steam and generate 800 kilowatts of electricity, which is 60% more efficient than a British-style boiler of the same size. The Soviet-style 1,000-ton deck cargo barge has a solid structure, places cargo on the deck for easy loading and unloading, and can carry bulky objects and equipment up to 60 meters long.

The superiority of Soviet-style products is also reflected in the service life and safe operation. All important parts of the 9-meter gantry planer have electrical safety devices, which will not cause accidents under normal circumstances. For example, if the oil pump fails to pump oil, the entire machine will automatically stop immediately, and the planer bed surface will not be damaged due to dry grinding. Because the Soviet oil-poor switch uses less oil than the British and American multi-oil switches, the risk of oil burning is also reduced. The Soviet-style double-groove tram line is superior to the British and American styles. It can ensure the safety of tram operation and greatly extend the service life of the tram line.

While ensuring excellent quality, Soviet-style products can also save a lot of materials in the manufacturing process. According to statistics on the annual production of six main Soviet-style products already manufactured by the Shanghai Wire Factory, materials worth more than 30 billion yuan, such as copper, tin, and rubber, can be saved throughout the year. The Shanghai Motor Factory reformed 10-kilowatt and 14-kilowatt motors according to Soviet design standards. The materials that could only produce 100 units according to the old standard can produce 117 units of Soviet standard motors.

    上海济南等地主要机器、电器、船舶等工厂
    试制成功许多种苏联式产品
    上海及济南等地的机器、电器、船舶等重工业工厂，为了适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，今年起，在中央统一设计下，开始有计划的按照苏联规范制造许多优秀产品，并在制造过程中节省了大量宝贵的材料。
    根据不完全的统计，今年各厂将试制苏联式产品近百种，包括重型工作母机、变压器、电动机、发电机、锅炉、船舶、电焊机、开关及各种电线、电缆等。其中已试制完成的主要产品有九公尺龙门刨床、三百二十安培九点六瓩直流电焊机、四吨锅炉、少油式开关、一千吨甲板货驳以及无硫橡皮绝缘线等三十多种，其他如工作母机之一的平面磨床、四公尺龙门刨床用的整套电器控制设备、十四到二百瓩电动机、一百到一千仟伏安的变压器、四百四十仟伏安的发电机以及能使一千二百对电话同时通话的电话电缆等更多更复杂的产品也将在年内陆续试制完成。这标志着在国家进入有计划的经济建设时期有头等重要意义的生产资料的生产有了新的增长。
    这些试制完成的苏联式产品在性能和效用上都超过欧美资本主义国家所制造的产品。能加工制造大型机件的重型工作母机苏联式九公尺龙门刨床虽有六千一百九十三个零件组成，重达五十六吨，但在开动时，所有部件的动作都由电器操纵，运用十分方便。它能根据工作物的不同要求，随时调节切削速度和进刀量。这都非英美式刨床所能比。主要用来连接钢筋结构以代替建筑物中铆钉的苏联式直流电焊机在效率方面比英美式高百分之五，使用率高百分之二十五。按旧标准制造的一根二百二十伏特电压、截面一平方公厘的橡皮电线只能通过五个安培的电流，按苏联标准制成的无硫耐热橡皮绝缘线则可通过十五个安培的电流，就是说，一根苏式电线使用时可抵上三根旧式电线。苏式四吨锅炉能蒸发四吨蒸气，发出八百瓩电，比英国式同样大的锅炉的效能高百分之六十。苏式千吨甲板货驳结构坚固，置货在甲板上，便于装卸货物，并能载运体积庞大的物件和长达六十公尺的器材。
    苏联式产品的优越性还表现在使用年限和安全操作上。九公尺龙门刨床所有重要部件都有电器安全装置，在一般情况下不会发生意外，如油泵打不上油来，全部机器就立即自动停止，刨床床面不会因干磨而损坏。苏联少油式开关因用油量比英美多油式开关少，油燃烧的危险也随之减轻。苏联式双沟型电车线更比英美式为优，它能保证电车行驶的安全，并大大延长电车线的使用年限。
    苏联式产品在保证品质优良的条件下，在制造过程中还能节省大量材料。根据上海电线厂已经制成的六种主要苏联式产品一年生产量的统计，全年可节省铜、锡、橡皮等价值三百多亿元的材料。上海电机厂按照苏联设计标准改制十瓩和十四瓩电动机，按旧标准只能制造一百部的材料可以制造苏式标准电动机一百十七部。
