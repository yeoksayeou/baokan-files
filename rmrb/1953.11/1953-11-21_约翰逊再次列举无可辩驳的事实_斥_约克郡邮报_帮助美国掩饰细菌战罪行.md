Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 20th. The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, recently wrote to the British Conservative newspaper "Yorkshire Post" regarding the issue of American germ warfare, refuting the attacks in the newspaper's October 30th editorial on his statements about germ warfare. The "Yorkshire Post" published the main points of this long letter on November 18th. The main points of the letter are as follows:

Sir:

Before you attack me, if you had read even a small portion of the extensive evidence already available that illustrates the reality of germ warfare, you might have come closer to the understanding of justice that we British people have. However, I must now briefly explain on what facts I base my belief that germ warfare occurred. These facts are: (1) First-hand research at the scene of the incidents in Northeast China. In these places, I observed the terrain, and to determine whether the facts were reliable, I repeatedly questioned witnesses who discovered large groups of poisonous insects – who either exterminated these insects themselves or summoned specially trained sanitation teams. (2) The materials exhibited at the scientific exhibitions in Beijing and Shenyang, where countless pieces of evidence were compared. (3) My conversations with prominent bacteriologists, scientists, and doctors – many of whom have international reputations. Much of the evidence was collected by them. (4) The oral or written evidence provided by two captured American airmen, Quinn and Enoch. (5) Reports from Chinese Christian pastors about what they witnessed, plus the testimony of 410 church leaders of various denominations – including three Anglican bishops and a Roman Catholic bishop. (6) The testimony of Mr. Becquet, who not only spoke with the aforementioned airmen (he testified that they spoke freely and truthfully), but also personally suffered such a germ attack. (7) Northeast China took strong, emergency, and comprehensive measures to eliminate all pests and poisonous insects, implement the strictest sanitation system, and ensure that the widest possible number of people were vaccinated. This measure must have cost hundreds of millions of wealth, which China urgently needed for other development projects. (8) Finally, after returning home, I studied: (A) Mr. Yves Farge and Mr. Claude Roy's reports on germ warfare. (B) The report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, headed by Dr. Brandweiner (Austrian professor of international law and Roman Catholic canon law, and a Roman Catholic). (C) The report of the International Scientific Commission. This commission visited the aforementioned airmen and two other air force prisoners of war, Lieutenant F. B. O'Neal and Lieutenant Paul Kniss. These reports, especially the last one, list a large number of facts and scientific evidence. These reports have been ignored or concealed by the BBC and British newspapers – including your newspaper. Recently, the United States has issued some statements in which Quinn, O'Neal, and Kniss recanted their original confessions, saying that they confessed under what Quinn called "pressure," but how much impact does this have on the above facts? If they were indeed pressured, they could have requested protection from the International Scientific Commission, or said that they had been abused. However, Enoch, in response to Dr. Joseph Needham, said that when he was shot down, he thought he would be tortured or shot, but "after they took my gun, they shook my hand and gave me a cigarette. Indeed, all our contacts were very friendly." These four are the very men who now say that their confessions, and probably what they said to the committee, were false, but if they were willing to lie to disgrace their country that time, then why wouldn't they lie this time, especially when faced with censure and disgrace, and the threat of military tribunals, or even the Valley Forge mental hospital? Finally, you ask why the International Committee of the Red Cross was not allowed to investigate. Let me answer you. First, the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross is not international at all. It is made up of some Swiss businessmen. Second, this committee, which you call a committee of independent, perceptive experts, investigated one of the most brutal places in human history – the horrific Auschwitz extermination camp, where four million Jews were gassed and then cremated. The International Committee of the Red Cross visited there while the extermination camp was still in operation, but they found nothing wrong there. These are the kind of people who are so-called "independent, perceptive experts." It is not enough to blindly believe the "news" from the United States Information Service. History and all mankind will make their own judgments on these matters. I am not at all worried about what these judgments will be, because I believe that, as in the case of Nazi Germany, the truth itself has power and will eventually be recognized by people. I hope the price will not be so great.

Canon Hewlett Johnson of Canterbury.

### 约翰逊再次列举无可辩驳的事实  斥“约克郡邮报”帮助美国掩饰细菌战罪行

    约翰逊再次列举无可辩驳的事实
    斥“约克郡邮报”帮助美国掩饰细菌战罪行
    【新华社柏林二十日电】英国坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊博士最近就美国进行细菌战问题写信给英国保守党报纸“约克郡邮报”，驳斥该报在十月三十日发表的社论中对于他所发表的关于细菌战的声明所进行的攻击。“约克郡邮报”在十一月十八日发表了这封长信的要点。这封信的要点如下：
    先生：
    在你们攻击我以前，假如你们读一下已有的、说明细菌战实际情况的大批证据——即使是其中的很小的一部分的话，就可能会比较接近于我们英国人对公正这两个字的了解。不过，我现在不得不简单扼要地说明一下我根据哪一些事实相信有过细菌战这回事。这些事实是：（一）在中国东北发生事件的现场所作的亲自研究。在这些地方，我曾观察地形，为了确定事实是否可靠，我曾反复询问过发现大群毒虫的证人——他们或是自己动手扑灭了这些毒虫，或是召来了受过特别训练的卫生队。（二）在北京和沈阳的科学展览会上展出的材料，在这些展览会上，对照的证据多不胜数。（三）我与著名的细菌学家、科学家和医生的谈话——他们中有许多人是有国际声誉的。证据中有许多就是他们所搜集的。（四）两个被俘的美国空军人员奎恩和伊纳克口头或书面提出的证据。（五）中国基督教牧师们对亲眼看见的事情提出的报告，加上四百一十位各教派的教会领袖——其中有三位圣公会主教与罗马天主教主教——的证言。（六）贝却敌先生的证言，他不仅与上述空军人员谈过话（他证明说他们是自由地、真实地谈出来的），而且亲身遭受过这样一次细菌攻击。（七）中国东北曾采取强力的、紧急的、全面的措施来消灭所有的害虫和毒虫，实行最严格的卫生制度，并尽量确使最广泛的人民得到注射。这次措施必然耗费了亿万财富，而这笔财富是中国其他各项发展所急需的。（八）最后，我在回国以后研究了：（甲）伊夫·法奇先生与克劳德·罗阿先生关于细菌战的报告。（乙）以布兰德魏纳博士（奥地利的国际法、罗马教法律教授，信奉罗马天主教）为首的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告。（丙）国际科学委员会的报告。这个委员会访问了上述空军人员以及其它两个空军战俘弗·布·奥尼尔中尉与保罗·克尼斯中尉。这些报告，尤其是最后的报告中列举了大批的事实和科学证据。这些报告为英国广播公司和英国报纸——包括贵报在内——所无视或隐瞒。近来，美国发表了一些声明，奎恩、奥尼尔和克尼斯在声明中推翻原供，并说他们是在受到奎恩所谓的“压力”时招供的，可是这对于上述事实又能发生多大影响呢。如果事实上他们受到了压力，他们满可以向国际科学委员会要求保护，或者说出他们受到虐待。可是，伊纳克在回答李约瑟博士时说，当他被击落时，他以为他会受到拷打，或者被枪杀，但是“他们在缴了我的枪后，就和我握手并给我一支香烟。的确，我们的一切接触都是很友好的”。就是这四个人现在又说，他们的供词，大概还有对委员会所谈的话，都是假的，但是如果他们那一次不惜撒谎来玷辱他们的祖国，那么这一次，尤其是在面临着非难和耻辱，以及军事法庭、甚至福奇谷精神病院的威胁的时候，他们又为什么不会撒谎呢？最后，你们问到为什么不让红十字国际委员会进行调查。让我来回答你们。第一，所谓红十字国际委员会事实上并不是国际性的。它是由一些瑞士商人组成的。第二，就是这个你们称之为由独立、敏锐的专家们组成的委员会，调查过人类历史上残酷无比的地方——恐怖的奥斯威辛屠杀营，在那里四百万犹太人被用煤气闷死以后焚化。红十字国际委员会当屠杀营还在进行工作的时候访问过那里，可是他们却认为那里没有什么坏事。所谓“独立、敏锐的专家”，原来就是这样一些人。不加判断地相信美国新闻处的“消息”是不够的。对于这些事情，历史和全人类会作出它们自己的裁判。这些裁判会是什么，我一点也不担心，因为我相信，正如对纳粹德国的情形一样，真理本身具有力量，并且终将为人们所认识。我祈望代价不至于那样大。
                坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊。
