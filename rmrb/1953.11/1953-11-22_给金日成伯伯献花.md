Presenting Flowers to Uncle Kim Il-sung
Students of New Beijing No. 11 Elementary School Su Xiaoqian Zhou Qiulin Wang Ting

    When we heard that we were going to present flowers to Uncle Kim Il-sung, we were so happy that we jumped for joy, and we didn't know what to say. Although we are all very young, we have known Uncle Kim Il-sung for a long time. Our parents told us, our teachers told us, and we have seen his photos in picture books and pictorials. Xiaoqian has asked his father several times to take him to Korea to see Uncle Kim Il-sung, but his father always said, "Study hard and we'll talk about it when you grow up." Qiulin is the same, always thinking about seeing Uncle Kim Il-sung as soon as possible. Who knew that before we grew up, Uncle Kim Il-sung came to us, and we could present him with flowers. How exciting! The night before presenting the flowers, Qiulin couldn't fall asleep. She turned over and over, but the sky was not yet bright. She listened and listened, but the wake-up bell had not yet rung. That night seemed to last for several nights.
    The next day, before it was even time to leave, the teacher helped us dress up: Xiaoqian was wearing a green naval uniform, looking very energetic. Qiulin was wearing a blue dress, brown socks, and shiny little leather shoes. Her two braids were neatly combed, and her black hair was matched with flesh-colored hair ties, which were both bright and beautiful.
    At two o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at the train station. Although there was still an hour before Uncle Kim Il-sung's arrival, the welcoming crowd had already filled the platform. Everyone was smiling and talking, but the voices were not clear. We guessed that they were all talking about Uncle Kim Il-sung. At this time, the sun also came out from the clouds, shining the national flags of China and Korea bright red, and the red scarves around our necks looked even fresher. Qiulin kept pulling the aunt standing next to her and asking, "When is Uncle Kim Il-sung coming? Is it not yet three o'clock?" That aunt just said, "Don't worry, he'll be here soon!" But while she said "Don't worry, don't worry," her eyes were always staring to the east. After a while, Premier Zhou also came, and everyone was applauding and cheering. But we were too busy looking at Premier Zhou to look at the east. At that moment, we felt like we didn't have enough eyes. Suddenly, green smoke rose from the eastern sky. "This time, Uncle Kim Il-sung's special train must have arrived!" We all thought so. Really, it really was Uncle Kim Il-sung who came! But, after getting off the train, there were so many people. Looking around, we couldn't find Uncle Kim Il-sung who looked like the photo. Qiulin whispered to the aunt standing next to her, "Which one is it?" "The one walking in front!" Oh! So fat, a little unlike his photo! After Uncle Kim Il-sung spoke, we ran over to present flowers. He smiled and accepted the flowers, and shook hands with us. Our mood at that time was indescribable. We just felt glorious! We accompanied him out of the station, watching him get into the car, until we couldn't see the shadow of his car, before returning to the ranks.
    Back at school, the classmates all wanted us to tell them about the scene when we presented the flowers. This one asked, "Is Uncle Kim Il-sung well?" That one asked, "Is Uncle Kim Il-sung fat?"... We couldn't answer, so we used our hands to gesture and tell them. Some classmates also said, "We must learn well from the heroic fighting spirit of the Korean children educated by Uncle Kim Il-sung, and do well in our studies!" In fact, we have already done so. Our hearts have long been connected with the hearts of the Korean children. This spring, we received a letter from Volunteer Army Uncle Zhao Xilun. He told us that the American devils' planes often came to the rear to disturb them, and the Korean children still studied in air-raid shelters. They found ways to overcome the difficulties of paper and pens. After reading the letter, we all thought that compared to the Korean children, we were so happy. If we didn't study hard, how could we be worthy of Volunteer Army uncles and Korean People's Army uncles? The team members also sent their pens, diaries, knives..., and photos of Chairman Mao to the Korean children. This time, we saw Uncle Kim Il-sung, and we thought of the Korean children under his education. Everyone is preparing to send them some precious gifts during the New Year. Xiaoqian is determined to become an air force soldier in the future, and Qiulin plans to become a good doctor in the future, ready to serve the motherland well when she grows up, and also willing to go to Uncle Kim Il-sung's place to serve the Korean people!

    给金日成伯伯献花
    新北京十一小学学生  苏晓前  周秋林  王庭
    听说给金日成伯伯献花，心里乐得直蹦直跳的，也不知道该说些什么。我们的年纪虽然都很小，可是早就知道了金日成伯伯。爸、妈告诉过我们，老师也告诉过我们，在小人书和画报上也看到过他的照片。晓前好几次要求他爸爸带他到朝鲜去看看金日成伯伯，可是他爸老是说：“好好学习，长大了再说。”秋林也是一样，总惦念着早日能够看到金日成伯伯。谁知道没等我们长大，金日成伯伯就到我们这里来了，还能给他献花，该多兴奋哪！献花的头一天晚上，秋林怎么也睡不着觉。翻过来看看天还不明，翻过去听听还没打起床铃，那一夜就好像过了好几夜一样。
    第二天，还不到出发的时间，老师就帮着我们打扮了起来：晓前穿着一身绿色的海军制服，看起来顶精神。秋林穿着一件青色的裙子、咖啡色的袜子、亮光光的小皮鞋，两个小辫梳得整整齐齐，黑头发配着肉色头绳，又鲜艳，又好看。
    下午两点钟，我们到了火车站。虽然离金日成伯伯到来还有一个钟头，可是欢迎的人群就把月台挤得满满的。每一个人都是笑着，谈着，声音听不大清楚，我们猜透准都是在谈金日成伯伯。这时，太阳也从云彩里钻出来，把中朝两国的国旗照得鲜红鲜红的，我们脖子里的红领巾看起来也更新鲜了。秋林直拉着和她站在一起的阿姨问：“金日成伯伯什么时候来呀？还没有到三点钟？”那位阿姨光说：“别着急，一会就来！”可是她嘴说“别着急，别着急”的，两只眼睛总是瞅着东方。一会，周总理也来了，大家都在鼓掌欢呼。可是我们顾了看周总理，就顾不得看东方。那一会儿，直觉得两只眼睛不够使唤。突然，东边的天上冒起了青烟，“这回，准是金日成伯伯的专车到了！”我们都这样想着。真的，真的是金日成伯伯来了！可是，一下车那么多人，看来看去，也找不到和照片上一样的金日成伯伯。秋林小声问站在她一边的阿姨：“那一个是呀？”“走在前面的！”啊呀！那么胖，有点不大像他的照片！金日成伯伯讲话后，我们就跑去献花，他笑着接了花，又给我们握手，我们那时候的心情，真是没法说，就是觉得光荣！我们又陪他走出车站，看着他坐上汽车，一直到看不见他坐的汽车影子，才回到队伍里。
    回到学校里，同学们都要我们给他们讲献花时的情景。这个问：“金日成伯伯好不？”那个问：“金日成伯伯胖不胖？”……没有办法回答，我们就用手比划着给他们说。还有的同学说：“我们要好好学习金日成伯伯教养出来的朝鲜小朋友的英勇斗争精神，把自己的功课学好！”其实，我们早就这样做了，我们的心早就和朝鲜小朋友们的心连在一起了。今年春上，我们接到了志愿军叔叔赵希伦的来信，他告诉我们美国鬼子的飞机常到后防去打扰，朝鲜小朋友仍然钻到防空洞里学习，纸、笔的困难，他们都想出办法克服了。看了信，我们都在想，比起朝鲜的小朋友，我们真是太幸福了，再不努力学习，还能对得起志愿军叔叔和朝鲜人民军叔叔吗？队员们还把自己的钢笔、日记本、小刀……，还有毛主席的照片，寄给了朝鲜小朋友。这回，我们看到了金日成伯伯，又想起了他教养下的朝鲜小朋友，大家都准备到过新年的时节，再送给他们一些珍贵礼品。晓前下决心将来要当一个空军战士，秋林打算将来做一个好的医生，准备长大了好好为祖国服务，也愿到金日成伯伯那里，为朝鲜人民服务！（附图片）
