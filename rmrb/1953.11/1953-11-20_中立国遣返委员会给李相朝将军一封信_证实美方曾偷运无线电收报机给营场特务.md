Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th – The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in a letter to the Korean-Chinese side’s General Li Xiangchao on the 17th, provided conclusive specific evidence proving that the U.S. military has been smuggling radios to secret agents they planted in the Indian custody zone, enabling them to receive instructions for sabotage.

The letter, written by General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, states that the radio discovered by Indian troops on November 7th was packaged in Tokyo in September and transported into the Indian custody zone by the 1st Broadcasting and Leaflet Group of the 8239th U.S. Army Unit.

The letter states: "A portable radio receiver (silver) was found in a barrel of dry yeast sent to Compound C of the POW camp in the Indian Custodial Forces area. This barrel of dry yeast was part of the rations allocated to them by the United Nations Command warehouse. The details of this radio are as follows:
(1) Portable super radio (silver). (2) The outside of the carton containing the radio has a white label with the following: NSN. Radio receiver. One each. Order number 33-204. Silver Trading Company, Tokyo, Japan. Packaging date: September 1953. MFCO, 1st Broadcasting and Leaflet Group, 8239th Army Unit, APO 500."

The letter stated that this illegal act of smuggling radios into the camp has been "brought to the attention of the United Nations Command and a protest has been lodged with them."

According to recently repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, many radios were smuggled into the Indian custody zone by Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents during the transfer of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, or later smuggled to them by the U.S. military authorities. Li Zhongren, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war repatriated on the 14th, said: "There was a radio powered by dry cell batteries given to me by an American Major Ham in my camp." He added: "Every camp leader had one, and there were plenty of spare batteries." Li Zhongren said that the secret agents in his camp received instructions from Syngman Rhee on the radio on November 7th: no one should listen to explanations.

In another letter from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to General Li Xiangchao, it was once again proven that the U.S. military authorities had secret agents in various camps who were communicating with each other. The letter described the incident where an Indian sentry intercepted a letter from Syngman Rhee secret agents in Camp No. 49 to the hospital camp. According to returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the hospital camp was the "secret agent headquarters," staffed by many U.S. officers as well as Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, who were instructing secret agents in other camps to sabotage the explanatory work.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission said in the letter: "At approximately 6:25 p.m. on November 7th, a sentry on duty outside Compound G 49, near the nurses' quarters of the 64th Field Hospital, saw two nurses outside the fence talking to prisoners of war from Compound G 49. The sentry told the nurses to leave, and they left. A few minutes later, the sentry saw something thrown out of Compound G 49, and he picked it up. It turned out to be a letter wrapped in a stone and tied with string. Shortly after, the nurses came back looking for something. The sentry told the nurses to leave, and they left. After a while, an older nurse came and asked the sentry if he had seen anything."

"This matter has been notified to the United Nations Command, and they have been requested to take immediate measures to prevent the personnel of the U.S. 64th Field Hospital from engaging in other illegal activities, and to notify the Commission of the steps taken in this regard."

The evidence provided in this letter is consistent with the reports of returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, who said that the secret agents in the South Camp were using various methods to pass letters between camps. These letters were not only thrown from one camp to another wrapped in stones, but also used dogs to deliver them, or put the letters in volleyball pumps and then ask the Indian guards to pass the pumps to another camp. Garbage truck drivers also became messengers. Secret agents also used the excuse of being sick to bring letters to the hospital camp or the infirmary in the compound, and then hand the letters over to secret agents in other camps there.

    中立国遣返委员会给李相朝将军一封信
    证实美方曾偷运无线电收报机给营场特务
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国遣返委员会在十七日致朝中方面的李相朝将军的一封信中，提供了确凿的具体证据，足以证明美军一直在偷运无线电机给他们在印度看管区中布置的特务，使他们能够收听破坏解释工作的指示。
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军所写的这封信说明，印度军队在十一月七日发现的这架无线电机，是九月间在东京包装的，由美国陆军第八二三九部队第一广播和传单组运进印度看管区的。
    信中说：“一架轻便的无线电收报机，是在发给印度看管部队地区中的战俘营C围场的一桶干酵母中发现的，这桶干酵母是联合国军仓库分配给他们的口粮的一部分。这架无线电机的详细情况如下：
    （一）轻便的超级无线电机（银色）。（二）装这架无线电机的纸匣外面，有着白色标签，上书：NSN。无线电收报机。各一。定货号码33—204。日本东京银色贸易公司。包装日期：一九五三年九月。MFCO，陆军第八二三九部队第一广播和传单组，军邮五百号。”
    这封信说，这种把无线电机偷运入营场的非法行为，已“提请联合国军司令部注意，并且已向他们提出抗议”。
    据最近遣返的朝中被俘人员说，许多无线电机是在把战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管期间，由国民党和李承晚特务偷运进印度看管区的，或者是后来由美军当局偷运给他们的。在十四日遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李钟仁说：“我的营场中有一架美国少校汉姆赠送的用干电池发电的无线电机。”他又说：“每一个营场领袖都有一架，并有大量的储备电池。”李钟仁说，他的营场中的特务分子，在十一月七日从无线电中收听到李承晚的指示：不得有任何人听取解释。
    在中立国遣返委员会写给李相朝将军的另一封信里，又一次证明美军当局在各个营场里布有特务，这些特务一直在互通消息。这封信讲到一名印度哨兵截获第四十九号营场里的李承晚特务们送给医院营场的一封信的情形。据归来的朝中被俘人员说，医院营场就是“特务总部”，里面有许多美国军官以及李承晚和蒋介石的特务们担任职员，他们正在指示其他营场的特务们破坏解释工作。
    中立国遣返委员会在这封信中说：“大约在十一月七日下午六时二十五分的时候，一个正在靠近第六十四野战医院的护士宿舍的G四十九号营场外值勤的哨兵，看到圈外附近有两个护士正在和G四十九号营场的战俘谈话，哨兵叫护士走开，护士就离去了。几分钟以后，哨兵发现G四十九号营场里有东西丢出来，他就把那东西拾起来。原来这是包着一块石头并用线捆起来的一封信。不久以后，护士们走来找什么东西。哨兵叫护士们走开，护士于是离去。一会儿又有一个老年的护士走来，并问哨兵有没有看到什么东西。”
    “这件事情已通知联合国军司令部，并要求他们立即采取措施防止美军第六十四野战医院的人员再有其他不法的行动，并将在这一方面所采取的步骤通知委员会。”
    这封信里所提供的证据，和归来的朝中被俘人员的报告正符合，他们说，南营的特务们正用各种方法在营场之间传递信件。这些信件不仅用包在石头上的办法由一个营场投到另一个营场去，而且也利用狗来传递，或者把信件放到排球的打气筒里，然后再要求印度看守兵把打气筒传到另一个营场去。装垃圾的卡车司机也成了通讯员。特务们又用假装生病的办法将信件带到医院营场或者围场的诊疗室去，然后再在那里把信件交给其他营场的特务们。
