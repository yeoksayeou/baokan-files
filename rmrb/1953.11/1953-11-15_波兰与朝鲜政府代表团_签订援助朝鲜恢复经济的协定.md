Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 14th: According to the Polish Press Agency, a government delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Li Zhouyuan, Minister of Commerce of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recently visited the Polish People's Republic. Polish and Korean parties held talks in a warm and friendly atmosphere. As a result of the talks, both sides signed an agreement on Polish aid to North Korea for the recovery of the national economy on November 11.

The agreement stipulates that Poland will provide North Korea with machine tools, rolled metal, railway vehicles, and other items free of charge from 1953 to 1954. Furthermore, North Korea will receive free material and technical assistance from Poland in the construction and reconstruction of industrial enterprises and mines, as well as in designing urban reconstruction plans for Korean cities.

This decision has been warmly supported by millions of Polish working people, who believe that it will not only help the heroic Korean people to restore their national construction but also contribute to the consolidation of international peace and security.

    波兰与朝鲜政府代表团
    签订援助朝鲜恢复经济的协定
    【新华社十四日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国商业相李周渊为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团最近访问了波兰人民共和国。波兰和朝鲜双方在热烈友好的气氛中举行了会谈。会谈结果，双方在十一月十一日签订了关于波兰援助朝鲜恢复国民经济的协定。
    协定规定波兰在一九五三年到一九五四年将无偿地以工作母机、压延金属、铁路车辆和其他物品供给朝鲜。并且，朝鲜在兴建和重建工业企业和矿场，设计朝鲜城市的改建计划时，将无偿地得到波兰物质上和技术上的帮助。
    波兰给予朝鲜的这些帮助，是根据一九五三年七月二十八日波兰人民共和国部长会议主席团所通过的关于援助朝鲜恢复国民经济的决定而规定的。这个决定受到了波兰千百万劳动人民的热烈拥护，他们认为这不仅有助于英雄的朝鲜人民恢复国家建设的事业，而且有助于巩固国际和平和安全的事业。
