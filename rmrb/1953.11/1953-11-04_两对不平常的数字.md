Two Pairs of Unusual Numbers
By our reporter Lǔ Shēng
	From the beginning of July to the end of September, the Huangtou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, only purchased 1,000 jin of wheat from Linze Village. However, in the three days of mid-October, it purchased more than 6,500 jin. Three months and three days, 1,000 jin and more than 6,500 jin, what a huge disparity between these two pairs of numbers! Why did this situation arise?
	In early June this year, when the task of purchasing wheat was conveyed to Jincheng, the Party and government leading organs here did not seriously study the importance of the wheat purchase work. They only issued an instruction to the districts and townships and entrusted this important task to the supply and marketing cooperatives. The supply and marketing cooperatives, as in previous years, generally arranged the wheat purchase work to the districts, and the districts generally arranged it to the townships. In this way, most cadres from top to bottom held the view that "it's always been like this every year." Of course, in actual work, they also did things in the way "it's always been like this every year."
	Liu Yanghai, the director of the Huangtou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, did just that. At the end of September, he looked at the accounts and found that only 1,000 jin of wheat had been purchased in Linze Village.
	In early October, the rural areas of Jincheng were in the wheat planting season. Due to drought, the vast number of peasants were waiting for rain and were slow to plant wheat. In order to sow wheat in a timely manner, the Jincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that the county's central task in the first half of October would be to mobilize peasants to fight drought and sow wheat. At the same time, it selected one or two villages in each district to focus on experimenting with the work of purchasing wheat (including autumn grain).
	Linze Village in Beishidian Township was one of the key villages in the county for purchasing wheat. Comrade Cui Guangyi, the township branch secretary (he is the deputy secretary of the district committee and the secretary of the township branch), convened a meeting of the Party and Youth League branches according to the instructions of the county committee. It was decided that the first step was to mobilize peasants to fight drought and sow wheat. In the course of sowing, Party members and Youth League members would publicize to the peasants the significance of selling wheat to the state for supporting national industrial construction, consolidating national defense, and improving the lives of peasants.
	Linze Village has 185 households, divided into five administrative groups. After the meeting, Cui Guangyi assigned cadres to the five administrative groups to actively lead peasants in fighting drought and sowing. Linze Village has pools and wells, and peasant families also have a few waterwheels, but the local peasants felt they were useless and rarely used them to water the land. Cui Guangyi first mobilized the peasant Li Jike to install a waterwheel on a pool, and he watered three mu of land in one afternoon. The peasants who were worried about not being able to plant wheat were all happy to see this fact. The next day, they successively installed all nine waterwheels in the village on wells and pools to water the land. Where waterwheels could not reach, the peasants used manure buckets and water buckets to carry water for planting. In six days, 450 mu of wheat were sown. At this point, the peasants were relieved and said, "Even if it doesn't rain, we can still plant all the wheat fields."
	While mobilizing the masses to fight drought and sow, cadres, Party members, and Youth League members simultaneously publicized the significance of wheat purchases to the peasants. When the township head proposed to everyone at the mass meeting to increase production and practice economy, use coarse grains instead of fine grains, sell wheat to the state, support national industrial construction, and consolidate national defense, many peasants said, "If you had said this earlier, we would have brought out the wheat a long time ago." At the same time, the township head also specifically announced the specific policies and methods for purchasing wheat, which gradually changed even a small number of peasants who had the idea of "waiting for high prices." For example, Liu Xiao'er's family of five harvested five shi of wheat in total. In the past, when he heard that the government was going to purchase wheat, he thought: the price of wheat must rise, so he dared not bring out the wheat. After hearing about the "deposit and pre-sale" method, in addition to selling 200 jin of wheat to the state, he also planned to deposit some more with the supply and marketing cooperative. Military dependent Liu Fudi also took 100 jin of wheat to the supply and marketing cooperative for deposit.
	When the peasants realized that the state's purchase of wheat was consistent with their own interests, they automatically brought out the wheat. From October 7th to the 9th, the Huangtou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Linze Village checked the accounts and found that it had purchased a total of 6,502 jin of wheat and 5,300 jin of millet, mung beans, and other miscellaneous grains. At the same time, it also supplied the peasants with 87 kinds of commodities worth 7.43 million yuan.

    两对不平常的数字
    本报记者　鲁生
    山西晋城县黄头村供销社在临泽村收购小麦，从七月初至九月底，三个月只收购了一千斤，在十月中的三天里，就收购了六千五百多斤。三个月和三天，一千斤和六千五百多斤，这是多么悬殊的两对数字啊，为什么会产生这种情形呢？
    今年六月初，当收购小麦的工作传达到晋城时，这里党、政领导机关并没有认真研究收购小麦工作的重要性，只给各区、乡发出一道指示，就把这个重要的任务委托给供销社去做。供销社和往年一样，将收购小麦工作一般地布置到区，区又一般地布置到乡，这样从上到下绝大部分干部对收购小麦工作都存在着“年年都是如此”的看法，当然在实际工作中也是用“年年都是如此”的做法来做了。
    黄头村供销社主任刘洋海就是这样做的。到九月底一看账，在临泽村只收了一千斤小麦。
    十月初，晋城的农村正是种麦期，因天旱不雨，广大农民都在等雨，迟迟不种小麦。为了及时播种小麦，中共晋城县委会确定全县在十月上半月以发动农民抗旱播种小麦为中心工作，同时在每个区选择一至两个村，重点试验收购小麦（包括秋粮）的工作。
    北石店乡的临泽村是全县收购小麦的重点村之一。乡支部书记崔广义同志（他是区分委副书记兼乡支部书记）根据县委指示，召开了党、团支部会议。决定首先动员农民抗旱播种小麦，在播种工作中通过党员、团员向农民宣传把小麦卖给国家，对支援国家工业建设、巩固国防、改善农民生活的意义。
    临泽村有一百八十五户人家，共分五个行政组。会后崔广义把干部分在五个行政组里，积极带领农民抗旱播种。临泽村有水池、水井、农民家也有少数水车，但是，当地农民认为它不顶事，很少用来浇地。崔广义首先动员农民李季科在水池上安装起一部水车，一下午就浇好了三亩地。正在发愁种不下小麦的农民们，看到这个事实都高兴起来。第二天他们先后把全村的九部水车都安装在井上和水池上浇起地来；水车车水浇不到的地方，农民们又用粪桶、水桶等担水点种。六天播种了四百五十亩小麦。这一下，农民都放下心来，说：“就是不下雨，也能够把全部麦田播种上。”
    在动员群众抗旱播种工作中，干部、党员、团员同时对农民宣传了收购小麦的意义，当乡长在群众大会上向大家提出增产节约、以粗粮代细粮、把小麦售给国家、支援国家工业建设、巩固国防的要求时，许多农民们都说：“早这样说，我们早就把小麦拿出来了。”同时乡长又具体宣布了收购小麦的具体政策和办法，更使一小部分有“等高价”思想的农民也渐渐转变过来。如农民刘小我全家五口人共收五石小麦。过去他听到政府要收购小麦，他就想：麦子一定要涨价的，可不敢把小麦拿出来。听了“存社预售”的办法后，他除卖给国家二百斤小麦外，还准备再往供销社存放些。军属刘福弟也拿了一百斤小麦到供销社存放。
    当农民认识了国家收购小麦和他们自己的利益是一致的时候，都自动地把小麦拿出来了。黄头村供销社在临泽村从十月七日开始收购小麦到九日看了一下账，共收购小麦六千五百零二斤，收购小米、?豆等杂粮五千三百斤。同时还供应了农民八十七种商品，价值七百四十三万元。
