    Cangxian Special District Construction Company Does Not Value Promoting Advanced Working Methods.
    Reader Pang Desheng writes: The Cangxian Special District Construction Company of Hebei Province does not pay enough attention to promoting advanced working methods. Although the company has arranged to promote advanced working methods such as "Su Changyou's Double-Handed Extrusion Mortar Bricklaying Method" and "Yang Dezhong's Flow Line Plastering Method," it has not deeply addressed the conservative thinking of employees and has not provided workers with specific assistance in using new tools. Some workers are not proficient in using the mortar spreaders, and the speed and quality of bricklaying are not as good as those of workers using trowels. Therefore, they are discouraged and continue to use trowels to lay bricks. The company leadership has not tried to help solve this problem. Now, most of the advanced tools at the company's various construction sites are left aside, exposed to the elements. The four mortar spreaders at the Provincial Cangxian Middle School construction site are so rusty that even the wheels cannot turn. The mortar spreaders at the Bozheng Normal School construction site are also thrown around haphazardly.
    The company leadership also does not value the inventions and creations of workers. From last winter to the present, workers have researched and created forty-two new tools, of which twenty-seven have been successfully tested, but the leadership has not paid attention to them. Worker Song Enhua created five new tools, including a "Mud Spreader" and a "Brick Puller," and requested the engineering department to test them. The cadres of the engineering department said: "The promotion section has been cancelled, and we can't handle it."
    Because of the lack of practical and serious promotion of advanced working methods and the lack of attention to the inventions and creations of employees, the bricklaying efficiency of most construction sites in the company does not meet the quota. Taking the Cangxian Normal School construction site as an example, the Zhuang Zhizhong team, which has the highest bricklaying efficiency at the construction site, averages only over three hundred bricks per person per day, while the poorer Liu Yongtai team averages only one hundred and seventy bricks per person per day. Insufficient grouting and incomplete soaking of bricks are very common, and the progress of the project is extremely slow.

### 沧县专区建筑公司  不重视推广先进工作方法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    沧县专区建筑公司不重视推广先进工作方法
    读者庞德胜来信：河北省沧县专区建筑公司对推广先进工作法不够重视。该公司虽曾布置过推行
  “苏长有双手挤浆砌砖法”、“杨德重抹灰流水作业法”等先进工作方法，但没有深入地解决职工的保守思想，没有在使用新工具方面给工人具体的帮助。有些工人使用铺灰器不熟练，砌砖的速度和质量反而不如使用瓦刀的工人们，因此都泄了气，照旧用瓦刀砌砖。公司领导方面对这种现象也没有设法帮助解决。现在该公司各工地的先进工具大部被扔在一旁，任凭风吹雨淋。省立沧县中学工地的四个铺灰器已锈得连轳轮都不能转动了；泊镇师范工地的铺灰器也扔得乱七八糟。
    该公司领导方面对于工人们的发明创造也不重视。从去年冬天到现在，工人们研究创造的四十二件新工具，其中有二十七件已经试验成功，可是领导上一直不加重视。工人宋恩华创造了“铺泥器”和“拉砖器”等五种新工具，要求工程科试验。工程科干部说：“现在推广科已经取消了，俺们顾不过来。”
    因为没有切实认真地推广先进工作法和不重视职工的发明创造，该公司大多数工地砌砖效率都达不到定额。以沧县师范工地为例，该工地砌砖效率最高的庄治忠小队每人每天平均也只有三百多块，较差的刘永泰小队每人每天平均只砌一百七十块。灌浆不足、浸砖不透的现象很普遍，工程进度也极为缓慢。
