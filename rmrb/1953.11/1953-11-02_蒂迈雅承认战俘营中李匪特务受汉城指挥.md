Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st. Our Special Correspondent Wu Min reports: As more and more prisoners of war break through the control of the Lee and Chiang special agents to demand repatriation, and at the same time more and more prisoners of war are murdered by the special agents in the prisoner of war camps, General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, now admits that there are a large number of Lee and Chiang special agents in the prisoner of war camps.

General Timayya said in an interview with the American International News Service that the prisoner of war camps detaining captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side were "filled with an atmosphere of ferocity and gloom." He said, "Some people definitely want to return to the other side. We know this from some of those who escaped and asked to be admitted to the hospital; they asked to be admitted to the hospital only to escape the influence of the anti-communist leaders." He said he believed there were so-called "political organizations" in the camps, and that "all evidence indicates that they receive instructions from the Anti-Communist Youth Corps in Seoul."

International News Service reported earlier from Munsan that, "Extremely reliable sources revealed that North Korean prisoners of war, controlled by powerful anti-communist leaders, are directed by the Korean Youth Corps from Seoul. He said that all the evidence indicated that this group strongly controlled the non-repatriated prisoners of war. This well-informed source also said that the powerful leaders in the Chinese prisoner of war camps are part of the Taiwan Anti-Communist Alliance."

Following General Timayya, a spokesman for the Indian Custodial Forces also admitted on the 1st that there was a special agent organization called the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" in "every enclosure", with headquarters in Seoul and Taiwan.

Captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side who have already been repatriated have long pointed out that these special agent organizations were arranged under the direct supervision of the American military authorities as early as Jeju Island and Geoje Island. The special agents among them were also arranged at that time. These special agents also deliberately messed up the names of the prisoners of war, so that they could mix among the prisoners of war without fear. The Korean and Chinese side has provided the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with a list of special agents, and requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take effective action against these special agents. The facts admitted by General Timayya and the Indian Custodial Forces prove that the demands of the Korean and Chinese side are completely correct.

    蒂迈雅承认战俘营中李匪特务受汉城指挥
    【新华社开城一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：在有越来越多的战俘突破李、蒋特务控制要求遣返，同时又有越来越多的战俘在战俘营中被特务谋杀以后，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军现在承认在战俘营中有着大批李、蒋特务的存在。
    蒂迈雅将军在向美国国际新闻社发表的谈话中说，在拘留朝中被俘人员的战俘营中“充满了凶恶和阴郁的气氛”。他说，“有些人肯定地是想回到另一方去的。我们从逃出来要求进医院的一些人中知道这种情况，他们要求进医院只是为了逃避反共领袖的影响。”他说他相信在营场里有着所谓“政治组织”，“一切证据表示它们得到反共青年团从汉城发出的指示”。
    国际新闻社在较早的时候曾从汶山报道说，
  “极为可靠的人士透露，为有力的反共领袖所控制的北朝鲜战俘，是由大韩青年团从汉城指挥的。他说，一切证据都说明这个集团大力控制着非遣返的战俘。这个消息灵通人士又说，在中国战俘营场内的有力领袖是台湾反共同盟的一部分。”
    继蒂迈雅将军之后，印度看管部队发言人在一日也承认“每一座围场里”都有一个叫作“反共青年团”的特务组织，这个组织在汉城和台湾都设有总部。
    已经遣返归来的朝中被俘人员早已指出，这些特务组织是早在济州岛和巨济岛的时候就在美国军事当局的直接监督下安排好了的。其中的特务分子也是在那时候就安排好了的。这些特务分子并且特地弄乱了战俘的姓名，使他们得以有恃无恐地混在战俘中间。朝中方面曾经向中立国遣返委员会提供了一份特务名单，并要求中立国遣返委员会对这些特务分子采取有效行动。蒂迈雅将军和印度看管部队所承认的事实，证明朝中方面的要求是完全正确的。
