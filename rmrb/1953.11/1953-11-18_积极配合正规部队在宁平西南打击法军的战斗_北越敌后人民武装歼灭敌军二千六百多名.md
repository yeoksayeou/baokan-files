Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to Vietnam News Agency, in order to cooperate with the Vietnamese People's Army in striking invading French troops on the Ninh Binh southwest front, the Vietnamese People's Army local forces and guerrillas in the North Vietnamese enemy-held areas have intensified their attacks, annihilating more than 2,600 enemy soldiers in over 20 days.

According to a communique issued by the People's Army Headquarters, during the 23 days from October 15th to November 6th, when French troops invaded Ninh Binh southwest, the People's Army local forces and guerrillas annihilated a total of 884 enemy soldiers in the left bank of the Red River area; annihilated 975 enemy soldiers in the right bank of the Red River area; annihilated 374 enemy soldiers in the middle reaches of the Red River, and captured enemy Major Ducas; and also killed or wounded 75 enemy soldiers in the northeast region of North Vietnam. The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces captured 600 enemy weapons of various types, destroyed 3 enemy tanks, 21 trucks, and 1 gunboat.

At the same time, the People's Army local forces and guerrillas in Ninh Binh province also actively launched frequent attacks, annihilating nearly 300 enemy soldiers in the twelve days from October 15th to 26th.
Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army has strengthened its air defense operations, shooting down a total of 11 French aircraft and seriously damaging more than 10 French aircraft in the two and a half months from early September to mid-November. Among them: During the 23 days of the French army's invasion of the Ninh Binh southwest liberated area, the Vietnamese People's Army shot down a French "B-26" bomber and a reconnaissance plane, and seriously damaged 9 fighter planes.

In order to deal with the indiscriminate bombing and strafing by French aircraft, the Vietnamese People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units, regular army, local forces, and guerrillas have all actively launched an anti-aircraft shooting campaign. Some units used rifles and machine guns to shoot at enemy planes. The guerrillas in Hung Yen Province, North Vietnam, concentrated their rifle fire and destroyed a French fighter plane at Pu Jiao. In Thai Nguyen, Lao Cai, My Duc in Ha Dong Province, Tien Lang in Kien An Province, Truong Xuan in Nam Dinh Province, My Tho in South Vietnam and other places, the People's Army local forces or guerrillas have hit French planes more than ten times. Many French aircraft pilots were captured alive by the People's Army local forces.

Many Vietnamese People's Army units have been commended by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army for their meritorious service in shooting down enemy planes.
Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army recently cleared out the remaining bandits in the Northwest New District, and has largely eliminated the bandits in Thuan Chau and Meng Lin areas of Son La Province, thus severely hitting Navarre's plan to sabotage the liberated areas.

On October 23rd, the People's Army completely annihilated all the bandits led by French colonialists in the Meng Lin area, about 35 kilometers southeast of the capital of Son La Province. Then, on October 25th, they divided their forces and advanced to suppress the bandit nests in the Thuan Chau area, 30 kilometers northwest of the capital of Son La Province, and surrounded the county seat of Thuan Chau. Under the attack and persuasion of the People's Army, Bai Jinshui, the bandit leader entrenched in the county seat of Thuan Chau, and the French commander, surrendered to the People's Army on November 1st with all their more than 560 bandits. In this way, the bandits in Meng Lin and Thuan Chau areas have been largely eliminated.

Currently, scattered bandits hiding in the jungle are successively surrendering to the local people's government.

    为了对付法机滥施轰炸和扫射，越南人民军高射炮部队和正规军以及地方部队和游击队，都积极展开对空射击运动。有的部队就用步枪、机枪射击敌机。北越兴安省的游击队用步枪集中射击，在浦角击毁了法军战斗机一架。在太原、老街、河东省的美德、建安省的先浪、南定省的长春、南越的美荻等地的人民军地方部队或游击队，曾击中法机达十次之多。有许多法机驾驶员被人民军地方部队活捉。

    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军最近在西北新区清剿残匪，已将山萝省顺州和孟林地区的匪徒大部肃清，从而沉重地打击了纳瓦尔的破坏解放区的计划。
    十月二十三日，人民军在山萝省会东南三十五公里左右的孟林地区，一举将法国殖民者率领的匪徒全部歼灭。接着在十月二十五日，又分路向山萝省会西北三十公里的顺州地区的各匪巢进剿，包围了顺州县城。在人民军的打击和劝降下，盘据顺州县城的匪首白锦水和法国指挥官，于十一月一日带着全部匪徒五百六十余名向人民军投降。这样，孟林和顺州地区匪徒已大部被肃清。
    目前，藏匿在丛林里的散匪正陆续向当地的人民政权投降。
