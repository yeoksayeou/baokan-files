    A Small Steamer Idled for Ten Months
    Wu Liangjie and Xu Yingjun wrote: At the beginning of this year, the Anhui Provincial Aquatic Products Company transferred a small steamer named "Wanbei Aquatic Products No. 1" from Bengbu to the Guangjiwei Aquaculture General Farm. However, the inner weir was overgrown with weeds, and the steamer could not navigate at all. This small steamer has been docked in Zongyang Town for a full ten months, from the beginning of the year until now. This April, the person in charge of the Zongyang Town Aquatic Products Business Office went to the provincial company for a meeting and raised this issue, requesting instructions on how to handle it. The leaders of the provincial company said: Let's notify the Transportation Department to take over. But the Transportation Department did not agree to take over. In May, Gao, the section chief of the provincial company's business section, came to Zongyang Town to inspect the work, but he did not pay attention to the problem of the steamer being idle. In July, another report was written to the provincial company, requesting a prompt resolution to the issue of the small steamer. The provincial company gave an instruction saying: "Await the approval of the Provincial Finance Committee." But since then, there has been no further response. The workers on the ship are eagerly awaiting the "approval," but they do not know when the "approval" will come down.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一艘小轮船闲停了十个月
    吴良杰、许英俊来信：今年年初，安徽省水产公司由蚌埠拨给广济圩养殖总场一艘名为皖北水产一号的小轮船。但圩内杂草丛生，轮船根本不能航行。这艘小轮船竟从年初到现在，在棕阳镇停了整整十个月。今年四月间，棕阳镇水产营业所负责人到省公司开会，曾提出这个问题，请示处理办法。省公司领导同志说：让我们通知交通厅接收吧。但交通厅没有同意接收。五月间，省公司业务科高科长来棕阳镇检查工作，但他对这艘轮船闲停的问题并未理会。七月间，下面又写了一个报告给省公司，要求迅速处理这艘小轮船。省公司来了一个批示说：“听候省财委会批示”。但以后又一直没有下文了。船上的工人们眼巴巴地等候着“批示”，但不知道什么时候才能“批示”下来。
