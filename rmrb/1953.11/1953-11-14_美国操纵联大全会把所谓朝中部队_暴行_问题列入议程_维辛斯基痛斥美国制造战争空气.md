Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on November 11th to discuss the recommendation, forced through by the US-British bloc in the General Committee, to include the provocative suggestion by the US delegation, smearing the Chinese and Korean forces of committing "atrocities" against POWs of the "United Nations forces," on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. The General Committee also recommended that this issue be submitted directly to the General Assembly for discussion without any preliminary discussion by any committee.

In his speech, U.S. representative Lodge could not produce a single example to substantiate the U.S. delegation's absurd lies. He merely repeated his slanderous clamor against China and North Korea.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky strongly opposed including the U.S. accusation on the agenda. Vyshinsky said: This proposal is based on fabricated facts and outrageous lies, and is obviously intended to be provocative, to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, to incite war hysteria, and to prevent the easing of international tensions.

Vyshinsky said that it was no accident that this proposal was brought to the United Nations at this time. He asked the Assembly to note an article published by a "New York Times" reporter on November 8th. In this article, the reporter frankly admitted that one of the United States' most loyal friends commented on the matter that the U.S. Department of the Army recently released a report on so-called atrocities to undermine the political conference discussing the Korean issue. Vyshinsky emphasized: It is for this reason that this issue is brought to the Assembly at this time. Vyshinsky said: The attitude of the U.S. representatives in the Panmunjom negotiations proves that their purpose is obviously to create the greatest difficulties in order to sabotage the political conference, thereby hindering the easing of international tensions.

Vyshinsky said: The deceptive and provocative nature of the "atrocities" issue is so obvious that even a newspaper like the "New York Times" pointed out on November 6th that the United States was acting so hastily on this issue that it has not yet told the Assembly what evidence it has to prove its accusations, nor has it stated exactly what its accusations are.

Vyshinsky pointed out that it is the U.S. military and the so-called "United Nations forces" that are violating international law. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea twice requested the Security Council in 1950 to investigate the facts that the U.S. Air Force bombed towns, massacred civilians regardless of men, women, old or young, and U.S. prisoners of war in North Korea, thus flagrantly violating international law. Vyshinsky said: Today, limited by procedural rules, I cannot talk about these many facts. But these facts are closely related to the issue currently under discussion. Because undoubtedly, thousands upon thousands of people have died as a result of the U.S. Air Force's bombing of North Korea. Among them were also "United Nations forces" prisoners of war, mainly U.S. and South Korean prisoners of war. And these liars and provocateurs are now trying to shift the responsibility for the deaths of these prisoners of war to the Chinese and Korean forces.

In view of this, the Soviet delegation firmly opposes including this issue on the agenda of the Assembly and firmly advocates rejecting the U.S. delegation's proposal.

During Vyshinsky's speech, U.S. representative Lodge rudely attempted to interrupt him twice. Lodge shouted from his seat twice, demanding that the chairman not allow the Soviet representative to continue speaking. Lodge insisted that Vyshinsky's speech went beyond the procedural scope of the issue. Assembly President Mrs. Pandit complied with this nervous outburst of the U.S. representative, and she twice asked Vyshinsky not to discuss the substance of the issue in detail, but Vyshinsky was not prevented from finishing his speech.

Lodge then went to the podium, claiming that he wanted to make some explanations. But the chairman did not allow him to speak. The chairman told him that he could make explanations when the substance of the issue was discussed.

British representative Lloyd supported the request to include the U.S. provocative proposal on the agenda.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy emphasized that the purpose of the U.S. delegation's provocative proposal is to divert world public opinion from the atrocities and massacres committed by U.S. troops against the peaceful residents of Korea, to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, to prevent the convening of a political conference on the Korean issue, and to make the international situation even more tense.

The General Assembly passed the inclusion of the issue raised by the U.S. delegation on the agenda with a majority vote. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it; the delegations of India and Guatemala abstained.

Indian representative Menon, in explaining the reasons for the vote, stated that on this agenda item, the Indian delegation would not participate in the handling or voting of any proposals. He asked the representatives to note that this discussion will be conducted in the absence of other parties directly related to this issue.

Representatives from Indonesia, Syria, and Yugoslavia said that they did not object to including this issue on the agenda because they felt that all issues raised should be included on the agenda. At the same time, they emphasized that the U.S. delegation had chosen an inappropriate time to present its proposal. They believed that the discussion of this issue would not be beneficial because it could further exacerbate international tensions.

Next, the General Assembly passed the proposal of the Special Political Committee on the issue of the treatment of Indian residents in the Union of South Africa. Forty-two national delegations, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, Arab and Asian countries voted in favor. Seventeen national delegations abstained. Only the Union of South Africa voted against it.

The General Assembly then continued to discuss the proposal on the Tunisian issue put forward by the Political Committee, the main text of which was appended with Iceland's amendment. This proposal with the Icelandic amendment did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority vote and was therefore not passed. Thirty-one national delegations, including the Soviet Union, voted in favor. The delegations of eighteen countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, voted against it, and the delegations of ten countries abstained.

The colonial countries led by the United States thus obstructed the passage of the proposal on the Tunisian issue, thus exposing themselves as mortal enemies of the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries.

    美国操纵联大全会把所谓朝中部队“暴行”问题列入议程
    维辛斯基痛斥美国制造战争空气
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十一月十一日举行全体会议，讨论美英集团强使总务委员会通过的建议，把美国代表团提出的诬蔑朝中部队对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的挑衅性建议列入本届大会议程。总务委员会并建议，不经任何委员会的初步讨论，就立即把这个问题提交大会全体会议讨论。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中举不出一个例子来证实美国代表团的无稽谎言。他只是再一次对中朝两国发出诬蔑的叫嚣。
    苏联代表维辛斯基强烈反对把美国的诬告列入议程。维辛斯基说：这项建议是以伪造的事实和弥天大谎为根据的，并显然怀有挑衅性的目的，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，煽动战争歇斯底里，并阻止国际紧张局势的缓和。
    维辛斯基说，这个建议在现在这个时候提到联合国并不是偶然的。他要求大会注意“纽约时报”一个记者在十一月八日发表的一篇文章。这个记者在文章中坦白地承认道，美国最忠实的朋友之一对这件事情的评论是，美国陆军部最近公布关于所谓暴行的报告，是为了破坏讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议。维辛斯基强调说：正是为了这个缘故，这个问题在现在这个时候提到大会。维辛斯基说：美国代表在板门店谈判中的态度证明，他们的目的显然是要造成最大的困难，以破坏政治会议，从而阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
    维辛斯基说：“暴行”问题的骗人的与挑衅的性质十分明显，以致像“纽约时报”这样的报纸也曾在十一月六日指出，美国在这个问题上表现得如此慌忙，以致到现在还没有告诉大会它有什么足以证明它的控告的证据，也没有说出它的控告到底是什么。
    维辛斯基指出，破坏国际法的正是美军和所谓
   “联合国军”。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五○年曾两次要求安全理事会调查美国空军炸毁城镇、不分男女老幼地屠杀平民以及在北朝鲜的美国战俘，因而悍然破坏国际法的事实。维辛斯基说：今天，限于程序规则，我不能谈到这许多事实。但是这些事实与目前所讨论的问题是有密切关系的。因为无疑的，由于美国空军对北朝鲜的轰炸，已有成千累万的人死去。其中也有“联合国军”的战俘，主要是美国与南朝鲜战俘。而这些骗子和挑衅者现在正想把这些战俘致死的责任转嫁到朝中部队的身上。
    有鉴于此，苏联代表团坚决反对把这个问题列入大会议程，并坚决主张拒绝美国代表团的建议。
    在维辛斯基发言当中，美国代表洛奇曾两次粗鲁地企图打断他的话。洛奇两次在座位上叫喊起来，要求主席不要让苏联代表继续说下去。洛奇硬说维辛斯基的发言超出了这问题的程序范围。大会主席潘迪特夫人答应了美国代表这种神经质的发作，她两次要求维辛斯基不要详细谈论问题的实质，但是维辛斯基并没有因而不能结束他的发言。
    洛奇然后走上讲台，据他说他要作一些解释。但是主席没有让他发言。主席告诉他，他可以在讨论问题的实质的时候来作解释。
    英国代表劳埃德支持把美国挑衅性的建议列入议程的要求。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希强调指出：美国代表团的挑衅性建议的目的，是要转移世界舆论对于美国军队对朝鲜和平居民的暴行和屠杀的注意力，是要阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题、阻止关于朝鲜问题的政治会议的召开并使国际局势更趋于紧张。
    大会以多数票通过将美国代表团提出的问题列入议程。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团投反对票；印度和危地马拉代表团弃权。
    印度代表梅农在解释投票理由时表示，在这项议程上，印度代表团将不参加任何提案的处理或表决。他要求代表们注意：这种讨论将是在和这一问题直接有关的其它方面缺席的情况下进行的。
    印度尼西亚、叙利亚和南斯拉夫代表说，他们不反对将这个问题列入议程，因为他们觉得所有提出的问题都应该列入议程。同时他们又着重指出：美国代表团选择了一个不适当的时候提出它的建议。他们认为这个问题的讨论是没有好处的，因为这可能使国际紧张局势进一步恶化。
    接着，大会通过了特别政治委员会提出的关于南非联邦印度居民待遇问题的提案。四十二个国家代表团，包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，阿拉伯和亚洲国家投赞成票。十七个国家代表团弃权。只有南非联邦投反对票。
    大会然后继续讨论政治委员会提出的关于突尼斯问题的提案，其中主文部分附有冰岛的修正案。这个附有冰岛修正案的提案没有得到必要的三分之二多数票，因而没有得到通过。苏联等三十一个国家代表团投赞成票。美、英等十八个国家的代表团，投反对票，十个国家的代表团弃权。
    以美国为首的殖民国家就这样阻挠了关于突尼斯问题的提案的通过，因此暴露了他们是殖民地与附属国民族解放运动的死敌。
