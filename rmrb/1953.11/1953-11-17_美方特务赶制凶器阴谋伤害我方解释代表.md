Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 16th. Special agent elements within the Tongjang-ni camp are intensifying the manufacturing of weapons, intending to use them to harm the Korean-Chinese side's explanation representatives and murder prisoners of war who reveal their desire for repatriation. Li Zhongren, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war who returned from Camp No. 51 on the 14th, said: Two "craftsmen" skilled at making knives have infiltrated Camp No. 51 and are working day and night to produce knives.

Li Zhongren, the day before he escaped from the camp (November 11th), saw three "prisoners of war" from Camp No. 49 come to Camp No. 51, but when they left, two of them stayed behind, and two prisoners of war originally in Camp No. 51 went back to take their place. Li Zhongren knew that one of the two people who went out to replace them was named Xu Jijun. That evening, Li Zhongren heard the special agent Song Chenglie say: "The 'specialized personnel' for making knives have now been replaced, and we will soon have weapons!" Song Chenglie also said: "From tomorrow onwards, we will rush to make knives, drawing patterns and making samples during the day, and working through the night. In the future, no one except the 'battalion commander' is allowed to come to the iron workshop."

Li Zhongren said: In addition to rushing to manufacture weapons, the special agent "battalion commander" of Camp No. 51, Jin Guangxian, also forced the prisoners of war to think of more ways to sabotage the explanation work, such as hiding disinfectant powder in their underpants and bringing it into the explanation tent, then throwing it at the explanation representative's face to blind him.

Jin Fushan, a returnee who escaped from Camp No. 49, saw special agents from Camp No. 49 and special agents in the "hospital" exchange coded messages, which were intercepted by the Indian custodial forces. Jin Fushan said that the letter was shot into the "hospital" with an arrow, landing outside the barbed wire and being picked up by an Indian soldier. But after that incident, the special agents in Camp No. 49 still used the same method to contact the Rhee Syngman special agents in the "hospital." On November 9th, Jin Fushan saw a special agent tie another letter to an arrow and shoot it to a Rhee Syngman "nurse" in the "hospital." After receiving it, the Rhee Syngman "nurse" said loudly: "Don't worry, our connection will never be broken." Li Zhongren also said that on November 8th, he saw the special agent leader Wen Chonghao move from Camp No. 49 to Camp No. 51 and personally stand beside the barbed wire to speak with Bai Yingtai, the secretary-general of the "Anti-Communist Youth League" of the Rhee Syngman special agent organization in the "hospital." At that time, he heard Bai Yingtai say: "I have received a special order from President Rhee, instructing us to..." Wen Chonghao said: "Let's discuss it after studying it!"

Li Zhongren and Jin Fushan both revealed the special agents' conspiracy to restrict the explanation time. Before Li Zhongren escaped, he heard a special agent say: "If the explanation time is too long, some 'wavering' people will be willing to return, which is detrimental to us." The special agent also fabricated rumors, saying: "The chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has allowed us to listen to only five minutes of explanation." Li Zhongren said that he decided to climb over the barbed wire and escape because he was worried that he would only be allowed to listen to five minutes of explanation and would not find an opportunity to apply for repatriation. This fact proves that some people are attempting to illegally restrict the explanation time under the pretext of so-called "mental coercion," and their purpose is to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

### 美方特务赶制凶器阴谋伤害我方解释代表

    美方特务赶制凶器阴谋伤害我方解释代表
    【新华社开城十六日电】东场里营场内的特务分子正在加紧制造凶器，企图用来伤害朝中方面的解释代表和谋杀透露遣返意愿的战俘。十四日自五十一号营场归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李钟仁说：两个擅长做刀子的“匠人”已经混进第五十一号营场，正在昼夜赶制刀子。
    李钟仁在逃出营场的前一天（十一日），曾看见四十九号营场的三个“战俘”到五十一号营场来，但在走的时候却有两个人留了下来，而由两个原在五十一号营场的战俘回去顶数。李钟仁知道出去顶替的两个人中有一个名叫徐基俊。当天晚上，李钟仁听到特务宋成烈说：“现在做刀子的‘专门人才’已经换进来，我们不久就有武器了！”宋成烈又说：“从明天起我们就要赶制刀子，白天画图样，打样品，晚上通宵干。以后除了‘大队长’，谁也不准到铁工场来。”
    李钟仁说：除了赶制凶器以外，五十一号营场的特务“大队长”金光宪还强迫战俘们多想破坏解释工作的办法，例如把消毒粉藏在裤衩里带进解释帐篷，把它甩到解释代表脸上，弄瞎他的眼睛。
    自四十九号营场逃出来的归来人员金福善曾看到四十九号营场的特务和“医院”里的特务传递密码信被印度看管部队截获。金福善说，那封信是特务用箭射到“医院”中去落在铁丝网外面被印度兵拾走的。但那次以后，四十九号营场的特务仍用同样的方法和“医院”中的李承晚特务进行联络。十一月九日，金福善曾看见一个特务又把一封信缚在箭上射给“医院”中的李承晚“护士”，李承晚“护士”在接到以后曾大声说：“你们放心，我们的联系永远也断不了的。”李钟仁也说，他在十一月八日曾看见特务头子文重浩从四十九号营场到五十一号营场活动，并亲自站在铁丝网旁边和“医院”中的李承晚特务组织“反共青年团”的秘书长白应泰讲话。当时他听见白应泰说：“我奉到了李总统的特命，叫我们……”文重浩说：“研究以后再说吧！”
    李钟仁和金福善都揭露了特务要求限制解释时间的阴谋。李钟仁在逃跑以前，曾听到特务讲：“听解释的时间长了，有些‘不坚定’的人就愿意回去了，这对我们是不利的。”这个特务并造谣说：“中立国遣返委员会主席已经允许我们只听五分钟解释。”李钟仁说，他就是因为耽心只准听五分钟解释，找不到申请遣返的机会，才下决心翻铁丝网逃出来的。这个事实证明某些人企图以所谓“精神虐待”的藉口非法限制解释时间，其目的是在强迫扣留战俘。
