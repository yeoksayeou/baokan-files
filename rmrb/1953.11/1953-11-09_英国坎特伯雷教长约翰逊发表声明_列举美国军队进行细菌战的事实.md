Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th (Dispatch): London News: The Dean of Canterbury, Hewlett Johnson, issued a statement on the issue of U.S. germ warfare. This statement was published in the "Evening Standard". The full text of the statement is as follows:

    In my opinion, there is nothing unclear. I firmly believe that the U.S. military conducted germ warfare in North Korea and China. My belief is based on the following facts: (1) On-site personal research. I repeatedly questioned witnesses who discovered large groups of poisonous insects to ensure reliability, then questioned some bacteriologists and scientists (many of whom were Western-trained), and with their assistance, examined the preserved insects under a microscope. (2) Materials found at scientific exhibitions in Beijing and Shenyang. (3) My conversations with many famous bacteriologists, scientists, and doctors. (4) The unforgettable evidence, verbal or written, presented by two captured American airmen, Quinn and Enoch. (5) Reports from Chinese Christian pastors regarding what they saw with their own eyes, and an appeal from four hundred church leaders.
    (6) The testimony of Mr. Jack Belden, who not only spoke with the aforementioned U.S. Air Force personnel but also personally suffered one such germ attack. (7) Northeast China had taken many measures to eliminate all pests and poisonous insects. For practical reasons, the entire Northeast China was isolated, and the entire population was mobilized to eradicate germ warfare. This measure must have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, which was urgently needed elsewhere for China's development. (8) Finally, after returning home, I studied: (a) Yves Farge's and Claude Roy's reports on germ warfare. (b) The report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers delegation headed by Dr. Brandweiner—an Austrian professor of international law and a Roman Catholic. (c) The report of the International Scientific Commission. This commission visited the aforementioned airmen and two other Air Force prisoners of war, Lieutenant F. B. O'Neill and Lieutenant Paul Kniss. The commission confirmed that these airmen were not restricted or coerced during the conversation. These reports are a large body of reliable scientific evidence. However, the BBC and British newspapers, including yours, ignored these things. Has your editorial writer who attacked me seen these documents? As for the pilots who are now said to have been tortured, I did not find any of the above people in their names. Have they been sent to the Fouch Valley Mental Hospital with others, under the thoughtful care of McCarthy's psychiatrists, to undergo brainwashing treatment? Why not let these unfortunate people speak? At the same time, we are told that British prisoners of war will also recount an experience of torture when they return home. As a result, they almost unanimously said that the Chinese who captured them treated them very well and with respect. I have not been silent. As long as I can say what I believe to be true, nothing can silence me.
    Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury.

    英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊发表声明
    列举美国军队进行细菌战的事实
   【新华社柏林七日电】伦敦消息：坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊就美国进行细菌战问题发表声明。这一声明刊于“标准晚报”。声明全文如下：
    在我看来，没有什么不明确的地方。我是坚决相信美国军队在北朝鲜和中国进行了细菌战的。我之所以相信这件事是根据以下事实：（一）在现场的亲自研究。我曾为了可靠起见反复询问过发现大群毒虫的证人，其后又问过一些细菌学家和科学家（其中许多人是西方训练出来的），并在他们的协助下，用显微镜查看了保存下来的毒虫。（二）在北京和沈阳的科学展览会上发现的材料。（三）我与许多著名的细菌学家、科学家和医生的谈话。（四）两个被俘的美国飞行人员奎恩和伊纳克口头或书面提出的令人难忘的证据。（五）中国基督教牧师们对亲眼看见的事情提出的报告，以及四百位教会负责人的呼吁书。
  （六）贝却敌先生的证言，他不仅与上述美国空军人员谈过话，而且亲身遭受过这样一次细菌攻击。（七）中国东北曾采取许多措施来消灭所有的害虫和毒虫。为了实际原因，整个中国东北被隔离起来，同时还动员了全体人民来扑灭细菌战。这次措施必然耗费了亿万财富，而这笔财富是别的地方急于需要来用于中国的发展的。（八）最后，我在回国以后研究了：（甲）伊夫·法奇与克劳德·罗阿关于细菌战的报告。（乙）以布兰德魏纳博士——奥地利的国际法教授，信奉罗马天主教——为首的国际民主法律工作者协会的调查团的报告。（丙）国际科学委员会的报告。这个委员会访问了上述飞行人员以及其他两个空军战俘弗·白·奥尼尔中尉与保罗·克尼斯中尉。这个委员会证实说：这些飞行人员在谈话时没有受到限制与强迫。这些报告就是一大批确实的科学证据。但是英国广播公司与英国报纸，包括你们的报纸在内，却对这些东西置而不顾。你们的那位攻击我的社论作者看到过这些证件吗？至于现在说他们曾受到酷刑的飞行员，我在他们的名字中并没有发现上述的任何人。他们是否已经与其他人一道被送到福奇谷精神病院，在麦卡锡的精神病学家的体贴照料下，受洗脑筋治疗去了？为什么不让这些不幸的人说话呢？同时还有人告诉我们英国战俘回了国也会叙述一段受酷刑的经历。结果不然，他们差不多异口同声地说：俘掳他们的中国人待他们很好，很尊重他们。我没有沉默过。只要我还能说出我认为是真实的事情，就没有东西能使我默不作声。
    休勒特·约翰逊，坎特伯雷教长。
