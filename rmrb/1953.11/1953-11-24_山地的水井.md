    Wells in the Mountains
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Rong'an
    One warm autumn afternoon, I met Zhang Fugui, a nationally renowned model agricultural laborer, in a well-tilled field west of Fugui Village, Wendeng County, Shandong Province. Barefoot and with his trousers rolled up, he was drawing water from a bucket with a leaky clay pot to irrigate the field, preparing to sow winter wheat after watering it. He said with a smile, "The Soviet elder brother uses artificial rain to fight drought, and we use this hand-held machine to fight drought." He pointed to the leaky clay pot and added, "Watering with this kind of leaky clay pot is much better than watering with a ladle. The water dripping from the leaky clay pot is fine and even, doesn't harden the soil, and easily penetrates into every corner of the field. One watering is almost like a light rain."
    Fugui Village is a small mountain village at the very tip of the Shandong Peninsula, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the sea on one side. Like many other remote mountain villages in our country, it is full of mountain ridges and barren land. Before liberation, there were droughts every year and famines every year. The peasants suffered from the brutal exploitation of feudal landlords and were also at the mercy of drought. Of the village's sixty-seven households, twenty-one had worked as long-term laborers for landlords, and twenty-eight begged for food year-round. After liberation in 1940, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, people broke free from feudal exploitation, organized themselves to dig wells to combat drought, prevented disasters, and gradually enriched their lives.
    Ten years ago, this village only had three ancient wells: the South Well, the North Well, and the East Well. People not only couldn't use the well water to irrigate the land, but even getting drinking water was difficult. The water source in the mountain wells was insufficient, sometimes available and sometimes not. When there was a drought, people had to wait in line for most of the night to fill a shoulder pole's worth of water. When it didn't rain, people could only watch their seedlings wither and die. In mountainous areas with ten droughts in nine years, digging wells to combat drought became the key to increasing grain production.
    In 1943, the local People's Government called on peasants to develop water sources and dig wells to prevent drought. Zhang Fugui was the first to respond, mobilizing the villagers to dig wells. They encountered many difficulties when they started digging. The land in this village had thick layers of rock beneath it, and many peasants said, "We are in a mountainous area, and digging wells to irrigate the fields may not work." The elderly even believed that there had only ever been these three wells and that no one had ever heard of water being dug out of rocky ground. A few backward peasants were afraid that digging wells would disrupt the "feng shui". Landlord Ni Yudai said, "Hmph! If Zhang Fugui can dig wells to combat drought, I can build a shed to block the sun." Zhang Fugui first dug in his own field, saying, "If digging wells brings disaster, let it fall on me first." He united the six members of his mutual aid team and started digging the first well. But after digging to a depth of fourteen feet, they still hadn't found water, and Zhang Fugui began to get anxious. When they dug further down, they encountered rock and couldn't dig any further. The first well failed. This made people even more convinced that there was no hope of digging wells in this village, but Zhang Fugui didn't lose heart. He changed locations and dug again. After he and his mutual aid team members found ways and tricks, they finally drilled through more than eight feet of rock and successfully dug a well in the south of the village. But the peasants still doubted that they could find water in the north and west of the village, so Zhang Fugui went to the north and west of the village to dig wells, and they were all successful.
    After Zhang Fugui successfully dug wells, he immediately organized a well-digging team and dug three more wells in the village. Soon after, there was a drought, and people became anxious as they watched the crops wither in the fields. Zhang Fugui used well water to irrigate the fields, and the crops continued to grow luxuriantly. At harvest time, the land irrigated by Zhang Fugui yielded 351 catties of corn per mu. Some land near Zhang Fugui's had similar soil and cultivation conditions, but because it wasn't irrigated, it only yielded 160 catties of corn per mu. From then on, the local peasants no longer doubted that wells could be dug in mountainous areas and that barren land in the mountains could not produce abundant yields. A wave of well-digging swept through the village.
    In order to help the peasants in his village dig wells, Zhang Fugui organized five more well-digging teams. He also went to other places to learn well-digging techniques and often studied with the well-diggers, which quickly improved the efficiency of well-digging. Digging a sandy-bottomed well only required five workdays for digging and masonry, and even the most difficult rocky-bottomed well, more than three fathoms deep, took no more than forty workdays. By 1945, the well-digging team had dug twenty-three wells for the village. In 1950, the village dug fifty wells, and in 1951, they dug seventeen more.
    Now, wells can be found everywhere in the mountainous and sloping land of Fugui Village. Whenever there is a drought, people draw water to irrigate the fields. Many mountain gullies and grasslands have been transformed into paddy fields after several years of renovation. Grain production has been increasing year by year. By 1951, the average output of the village had exceeded the pre-war average output by 30%. Since 1947, under the advocacy of the Wendeng County Farm, the peasants of Fugui Village have been improving the soil every year by using sand to cover mud and mud to cover sand, and have promoted the use of improved varieties such as flat-spike wheat and white-tooth corn, deep plowing and careful cultivation, and rational fertilization, which has further increased yields. Compared with before the war, the pre-war wheat yield per mu was generally more than 80 catties, but now even the worst land can yield more than 100 catties. Last year, the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team even became a model of high wheat yield in East China, yielding more than 500 catties of wheat per mu. Before the war, corn could yield 180-190 catties per mu, but this autumn, despite various disasters, the average yield was still more than 210 catties per mu, with good yields reaching more than 330 catties. Sweet potatoes have increased by 100% compared to pre-war levels. Many peasants have started vegetable gardens near their homes. Cabbage and radishes, which were rarely seen in this village in the past, have now become common vegetables.
    With the increase in grain production, the living conditions of the peasants in Fugui Village have improved significantly. People are wearing city-made cloth clothes and rubber-soled shoes. Whenever there is a fair, the men wear neat new clothes, and the women and children wear colorful clothes. The village, which never had a school in the past, now has one, and all school-age children are enrolled. But people understand that although the present time is much better than the past, it is still far from their ideal. In order to produce more grain, people invest most of their savings in reproduction. In addition to well-digging, which is the biggest investment, the village has added 65 rubber-wheeled handcarts in recent years. In the past, the village had only seven livestock at its lowest point, but now it has twenty-five, including seven added this year alone. The use of chemical fertilizers is also relatively common in this village. Recently, the peasants of Fugui Village have responded to the government's call for increased production and conservation. The men are irrigating sweet potatoes, radishes, and cabbage in the fields. For sweet potatoes alone, the village has 200 mu, and after one watering, each plant can grow at least two liang, and with 2,000 plants per mu, the village can increase sweet potato production by 50,000 catties. The women are taking dried sweet potatoes that have been stored for two or three years to the sun to dry, preparing to keep the good ones for human consumption and the bad ones for feeding pigs, so as to save more grain for sale to the state.
    When the reporter left Fugui Village, it hadn't rained yet, but the winter wheat was already growing lush and green on the mountains and slopes. Many sweet potato, radish, and cabbage fields had also been thoroughly watered. People are confident in striving for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops and next year's wheat.

    山地的水井
    本报记者  张荣安
    一个秋阳温暖的下午，在山东省文登县富贵村村西一块已经耕得很平整的地里，我见到了全国著名农业劳动模范张富贵。他赤着脚、挽着裤管，用一个漏水瓦罐从水桶里汲水浇田。准备把这块地浇好后播种冬小麦。他笑着说：“苏联老大哥用人造雨和旱灾作斗争，我们用这个手提机器和旱灾作斗争。”他一边指着那个漏水瓦罐，一边又说：“用这种漏水瓦罐浇地比用瓢浇好得多，漏水瓦罐淋下来的水又细又匀，拍不硬地皮，又容易渗透到地里每个角落，浇一遍和下一场小雨差不多。”
    富贵村是山东半岛极尖端的一个小山村，三面环山，一面临海。和我国其它许多偏僻的山村一样，尽是一些山岭薄地。解放前，年年闹旱，岁岁饥荒。农民受着封建地主的残酷剥削，还要受天旱的摆布。全村六十七户人家，就有二十一户给地主当过长工，二十八户常年讨饭。一九四○年解放后，人们在共产党和人民政府的领导下，摆脱了封建剥削，自己组织起来打井抗旱，防止了灾荒，使人们的生活逐步富裕起来。
    十年前，这村只有南井、北井、东井三眼古井。人们不仅不能利用井水浇地，吃的水都很困难。山地井水水源不足，时有时无，碰到天旱，吃水的人要排着队等上大半夜才能汲满一担水。天不下雨，人们只好眼巴巴地看着小苗枯死。十年九旱的山地，打井抗旱就成了增产粮食的关键。
    一九四三年当地人民政府号召农民开发水源，打井防旱。张富贵首先响应，动员全村农民打井。开始打井，碰到很多困难。这村很多土地下面埋藏着很厚的石层，许多农民说：“咱这里是山岭地，打井浇田怕行不通。”老年人更认为：自古以来就这三眼井，没听说谁在石头地里打出过水来。个别落后农民怕打井破了风脉。地主倪玉岱说：“哼！张富贵能打井抗旱，我能搭天棚遮太阳。”张富贵首先在自己地里打，他说：“要是因为打井天降灾难，先降到我身上。”他团结起自己互助组内的六个组员，开始打第一眼井。可是挖了一丈四尺深还没有见水，张富贵也有些焦急起来。再往下挖时，碰到了石头，再也挖不动了，第一眼井就这样失败了。这一来人们更认为在这村打井没有希望，但张富贵并没有从此灰心。他又换了个地方来打，经过他和他的互助组组员想办法、找窍门，终于钻透八尺多厚的石层，在村南打成了一眼井。但农民还怀疑村北和村西打不出水来，张富贵就到村北和村西打井，结果都打成了。
    张富贵打井成功后，马上组织一个打井小组，一连在村里打了三眼井。不久就遇上天旱，眼看满田庄稼枯萎了，人们都着了急。张富贵利用井水浇田，庄稼长得依然茂盛。秋收时，张富贵用水浇过的地，每亩收玉米三百五十一斤。和张富贵靠近的一些地，土壤、耕作条件都差不多，但因为没有用水浇，每亩只收玉米一百六十斤。从此当地农民再不怀疑山地不能打井和山岭薄地不能丰产。打井热潮在全村掀起来了。
    张富贵为了帮助本村农民打井，又组织了五个打井组。他还到外地学来打井技术，又经常和打井的人共同研究，打井效率很快地提高了。打一眼沙底井连挖带砌只需五个工，最难打的石底井，打三丈多深，顶多也不超过四十个工。到一九四五年，打井组已给本村打井二十三眼。一九五○年全村打井五十眼，一九五一年又打了十七眼。
    现在富贵村的山地、坡地到处都有了水井。每逢天旱人们就汲水浇田。许多山沟草地经过几年的修整变成了水稻田。粮食产量逐年在增加着。到一九五一年全村平均产量已超过战前平均产量百分之三十。自一九四七年以来，在文登县农场倡导下，富贵村农民每年用沙压泥、泥压沙的办法改良土壤，并推广了扁穗小麦、白马牙玉米等优良品种，深耕细作、合理施肥，产量更提高了。和战前比较，战前一亩地小麦一般能打八十多斤，现在最坏的地也能打一百多斤，去年还出了全华东区小麦丰产模范张富贵互助组。一亩地小麦打五百多斤。玉米在战前一亩地能打一百八、九十斤，今年秋庄稼遭受了各种灾害，平均一亩还打二百一十多斤。好的打到三百三十多斤。地瓜比战前增产了百分之一百。许多农民在自己住宅附近经营起菜园，过去在这村很少见的白菜、萝卜现在已成了普通食用的蔬菜了。
    随着粮食产量的增加，富贵村农民的生活显著改善，人们都穿上了市布衣服和胶底鞋，每当逢集，男人们穿着整齐的新衣，女人、小孩穿着花花绿绿的衣裳。这村过去从来没有过的小学校现在也有了，学龄儿童已全部入学。但是人们懂得，现在的时光虽然比过去好多了，但距离人们的理想还差得很远。为着打更多的粮，人们把大部分积蓄投入再生产。除了打井是一项最大的投资外，几年来全村增加胶轮手推小车六十五辆。过去这村牲口最少的时候只有七头，现在有了二十五头，光今年就增加了七头。在这村使用化学肥料也比较普遍。最近，富贵村农民响应政府增产节约的号召，男人们在地里浇地瓜、萝卜、白菜。光地瓜一项，全村二百亩，浇一遍后每棵至少可增长二两，一亩两千棵，全村就可增产地瓜五万斤。女人们把放了二、三年的陈地瓜干拿到太阳地里晒，准备把好的留下来人吃，坏的喂猪，多节省些粮食卖给国家。
    当记者离开富贵村时，这村还没有落雨，可是满山遍坡的冬小麦已经长得绿油油的了。不少地瓜、萝卜、白菜地里也浇透了水。人们都有信心争取今年晚庄稼和明年小麦的丰收。
