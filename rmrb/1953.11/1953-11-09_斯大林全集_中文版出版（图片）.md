The Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" is translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin's Works under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The picture shows the translation staff of the Bureau engaged in translation work.

The Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" is printed by the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory. The picture shows the operator and assistant of the four-color offset printing machine in the factory inspecting the quality of the cover printing.

After receiving the task, Jin Yuquan, the leading worker and outstanding producer of the No. 1 letterpress printing machine workshop, and his workmates jointly studied and repeatedly proposed the advanced working method of "frequent plate brushing, frequent rubber washing, and frequent inspection," which ensured that the printing machine did not produce a single defective product in two months of printing. The workers brought collective strength into play, creating a linked and interchangeable plate mounting method, which shortened the plate mounting time by 30%, increased output, and ensured a high printing quality with clear characters and consistent ink color. The picture shows the production situation in the letterpress printing workshop.

The binding workshop showed a high degree of tension. This is the scene of workers operating the new automatic collating machine.

The female workers of the technical supervision section's inspection team are concentrating on reading the books and doing the final inspection. Their slogan is: "Don't let a single defective product leave the factory!" Female workers in the binding department are particularly carefully doing the last process - wrapping the outer covers.

The statistician of the technical supervision section timely compiles and registers the quantity and quality record sheets of individual printing workers.

In order to deliver the first volume of the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" to all parts of the country in a timely manner and meet the ardent expectations of millions of readers across the country, the North China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has specially dispatched a delivery team to the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory to do packing work. This is a batch of packed book boxes, loaded into vehicles to be transported to the post office, and then forwarded to various places.

The Beijing Branch of Xinhua Bookstore is distributing the first volume of the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" to pre-ordered groups.

The library of Beijing Normal University collected 787 copies of the first volume of the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" pre-ordered by the teachers and students of the whole school and distributed them to the teachers and students who had pre-ordered them.

On November 7, the first volume of the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" was widely distributed throughout the country. Book buyers were extremely enthusiastic at the Wangfujing Street outlet of the Beijing Branch of Xinhua Bookstore.

After gloriously accepting the task of producing paper for the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin", the workers of the state-owned Northeast Shixian Paper Mill enthusiastically proposed to complete the task ahead of schedule on the premise of ensuring product quality. This is the scene of workers in the papermaking workshop in production.  Northeast Korean People's Daily draft, photo by Jin Zhenhao
