Newspapers of the proletariat must have a clear class character, must serve the political line of the proletariat, and must serve to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the fundamental stance of proletarian newspapers.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party has promoted a thoroughly revisionist news line in the news industry. One of his main slogans is that news reporting must be "objective" and "impartial." He says: "News reporting is objective, true, impartial, and comprehensive, and this can establish prestige in the world. If we do not dare to emphasize objective and true reporting, and only emphasize stance, then our reporting will have subjectivism and one-sidedness... and will lose everything."

Is there such a thing as superclass "objective" and "impartial" news reporting in the world? There absolutely is not. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Before classes are eliminated, regardless of newspapers, periodicals, radio, and news agencies, they all have class character and serve a certain class. The news industry of the proletariat is the mouthpiece of the proletariat, a powerful weapon for the proletariat to carry out class struggle against the bourgeoisie, seize power, and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat. The news industry of the bourgeoisie is the mouthpiece of the bourgeoisie, a tool for the bourgeoisie to suppress proletarian revolution and maintain bourgeois rule. In a society of class antagonism, there has never been any superclass, impartial news for all classes. American imperialism calls its savage invasion of Asian, African, and Latin American peoples "assisting backward countries." The Soviet revisionist ruling clique praises their capitulation to American imperialism as "defending world peace." Reactionary forces in various countries all disguise their brutal exploitation and bloody suppression of the working people as "maintaining a democratic paradise." Look through all the newspapers of the exploiting classes at home and abroad; where is there any "objective" and "impartial" news reporting for the proletariat and revolutionary people?

Comrade Lin Biao says: "Objectivism is a thought system of the bourgeoisie. This objectivism, on the surface, denies class. But in reality, it uses this form to conceal its class face, class wishes, class policies, and class actions, to deceive the masses." It is precisely with "objectivity" and "impartiality" as a cover that China's Khrushchov conceals the wishes and will of the bourgeoisie he represents, attempting to turn our news industry into a tool for him to promote his counterrevolutionary revisionist line and restore capitalism.

Isn't this the case?

China's Khrushchov, under the banner of "objectivity" and "impartiality," in international propaganda, keeps silent about anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and instead fervently advocates that our newspapers should publish a large amount of reactionary news slandering and cursing our country from the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. He has repeatedly shouted: "Our newspapers 'dare not publish' things that imperialism curses us with, 'this is our weakness, not our strength.'" In 1956, the 20th Congress of the CPSU launched a major attack on Stalin, grossly distorting the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries joined forces to launch a wave of anti-communism internationally. China's Khrushchov seized this opportunity to immediately jump out and shout: "Now the objective situation has changed," news work "is better with openness," "now our international news reporting has only one side: cursing America, saying we are good. This one-sided reporting will create illusions and cultivate subjectivism."

Originally, China's Khrushchov's "objectivity" and "impartiality" is to attack and slander socialism, not allowing newspapers to "say we are good," to whitewash American imperialism, not allowing newspapers to publish "cursing America," but to publish news of "American government leaders cursing us." This is completely the genuine tone of an imperialist lackey.

China's Khrushchov, under the banner of "objectivity" and "impartiality," in domestic propaganda, keeps silent about the fundamental task of newspapers being to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the Party's program, line, principles, and policies, and instead vigorously incites newspapers to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and expose the so-called "dark side" of socialist society. As early as 1948, he blatantly proposed: "Do not be afraid to reflect dark things," to "reflect what the people dare not say, do not want to say, think to say but cannot say." This reactionary proposal of his became even more stubborn during the historical period of deepening socialist revolution. Especially during the three years of economic difficulties, he once again, in collaboration with various reactionary forces internationally, launched a frenzied attack against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and intensified the use of newspapers to carry out his conspiracy to restore capitalism. He said viciously: "All illusions must be exposed. After exposure, light will appear. Some say, exposure, fear it will become pitch black. If it is indeed so, let it be pitch black, this is seeking truth from facts!"

What a "seeking truth from facts"!

The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the three magic weapons for building socialism in our country. Under the brilliant guidance of the General Line, the people of the entire country were full of spirit and achieved the Great Leap Forward on all fronts; while the People's Communes, which emerged in response to the times, were a great revolutionary initiative of the 500 million peasants in our country. It is precisely because of these three magic weapons that our people have overcome the severe natural disasters and the difficulties caused by the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionists during the three years of natural disasters, and achieved great successes. This is a historical fact that no one can deny. China's Khrushchov described the great cause undertaken by the 700 million people of our country as "pitch black," with nothing good about it. Is this called "seeking truth from facts"? Chairman Mao said: "For revolutionary writers and artists, the object of exposure should only be the invaders, exploiters, oppressors, and the evil influences they have left among the people, and not the people. Unless it is a counterrevolutionary writer or artist, there can be no such descriptions as 'the people are naturally stupid' and 'revolutionary masses are tyrannical despots.'" All counterrevolutionary propaganda is an attack on the proletariat under the guise of so-called "objectivity," "impartiality," and so-called "truth." China's Khrushchov's so-called "objectivity" and "impartiality" is "exposure." He keeps shouting that he wants to "expose" and wants to "expose" it to be "pitch black," not for what "truth," what "objectivity," "impartiality," but to attack one point and not touch the rest, using our country's three years of economic difficulties to frenziedly attack Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, distort the communist ideological system and social system, undermine the people's confidence in the victory of communism, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Look at the things like "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three Family Village Notes" that flooded the newspapers at that time; aren't they all of this kind?

All exploiting classes, due to their reactionary class nature, their newspapers can never be objective and impartial; they can only live by spreading rumors and lies. Only the proletariat truly represents the highest interests of the vast majority of people. Proletarian newspapers, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can therefore deeply expound the objective law that the socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, expose the essence of all evil activities of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and make the most correct and profound scientific judgments on various social phenomena. Abandoning a firm proletarian stance, betraying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and shouting about "objectivity" and "impartiality" are all deceitful talk. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie's theory of "objectivity" and "impartiality" is essentially a reactionary slogan of flattering the enemy and surrendering to the enemy, and we must thoroughly criticize and expose it.

### 超阶级的“客观”“公正”论是资产阶级反动口号

    超阶级的“客观”“公正”论是资产阶级反动口号
    铁道兵政治部新闻科　铁道兵报社
    无产阶级的报纸必须具有鲜明的阶级性，必须为无产阶级的政治路线服务，必须为巩固无产阶级专政服务。这是无产阶级报纸的根本立场。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在新闻界推行了一条彻头彻尾的修正主义新闻路线。他的主要口号之一，就是新闻报道要“客观”、“公正”。他说：“新闻报道是客观的、真实的、公正的、全面的，这就能在世界上建立威信”，“我们如果不敢强调客观的、真实的报道，只强调立场，那末，我们的报道就有主观主义，有片面性……就会丧失一切”。
    世界上真有什么超阶级的“客观”、“公正”的新闻报道吗？根本没有。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。无产阶级的新闻事业，是无产阶级的喉舌，是无产阶级向资产阶级进行阶级斗争，夺取政权，实行无产阶级专政的有力武器。资产阶级的新闻事业，是资产阶级的喉舌，是资产阶级镇压无产阶级革命、维护资产阶级统治的工具。在阶级对立的社会里，从来就没有什么超阶级的、对各阶级一律“客观”、“公正”的新闻。美帝国主义把它对亚、非、拉人民的野蛮侵略说成是“援助落后国家”，苏修统治集团把他们投降美帝的活动吹嘘为“保卫世界和平”，各国反动派都把他们对劳动人民的残酷剥削和血腥镇压粉饰为“维护民主自由的天堂”。翻遍中外一切剥削阶级的报纸，那里有对无产阶级和革命人民是“客观”、“公正”的新闻报道？！
    林彪副主席说：客观主义，是“资产阶级的一种思想体系。这种客观主义的思想，在表面上是否认阶级的。但是，实际上用这种形式来掩盖它的阶级的面貌，阶级的愿望，阶级的政策，阶级的行为，便于欺骗群众。”中国赫鲁晓夫正是用“客观”、“公正”作为幌子，来掩盖他所代表的资产阶级的愿望和意志，妄图把我国新闻事业变成他推行反革命修正主义路线、复辟资本主义的舆论工具。
    事实不正是这样吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫打着“客观”、“公正”的招牌，在国际宣传上闭口不谈反帝反修，反而狂热鼓吹我们的报纸要大量刊登帝、修、反污蔑、咒骂我国的反动新闻。他不止一次地叫嚷：我们的报纸“不敢发表”帝国主义骂我们的东西，“这是我们的弱点，不是我们的优点”。一九五六年苏共“二十大”大反斯大林，大肆丑化无产阶级专政，帝、修、反联合起来在国际上掀起了一股反共的恶浪。中国赫鲁晓夫抓住这个时机立即跳出来叫喊：“现在客观情况变了”，新闻工作“以开放为好”，“现在我们的国际新闻报道只有一面：骂美国的，说我们好的。这种片面性的报道，会造成假象，培养主观主义。”
    原来，中国赫鲁晓夫的“客观”、“公正”，就是要攻击和诬蔑社会主义，不准报纸“说我们好”，就是要为美帝国主义涂脂抹粉，不准报纸刊登“骂美国的”，而要刊登“美国政府首脑骂了我们”的新闻。这完全是货真价实的帝国主义奴才的腔调。
    中国赫鲁晓夫打着“客观”、“公正”的招牌，在国内宣传方面，闭口不谈报纸的根本任务是宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的纲领、路线、方针、政策，反而大肆煽动报纸攻击无产阶级专政，揭露社会主义社会的所谓“阴暗面”。早在一九四八年，他就露骨地提出：“不要怕反映黑暗的东西”，要“把人民心里不敢说的，不肯说的，不想说的，想说又说不出来的话反映出来”。他的这一反动主张，到了社会主义革命深入发展的历史时期，更加顽固地表现出来。特别是在三年经济困难时期，他又一次配合国际上各种反动势力的反华大合唱，猖狂反对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，加紧利用报刊进行复辟资本主义的阴谋活动。他恶狠狠地说：“所有假象都要揭露，揭露后会出现光明。有人说，揭露，怕说成漆黑一团，如果确是如此，就让他漆黑一团，这是实事求是！”
    好一个“实事求是”！
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国建设社会主义的三大法宝。在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民意气风发，在各条战线上实现了大跃进；而应运而生的人民公社，则是我国五亿农民的伟大革命创举。正是有了这三大法宝，我国人民才战胜了三年严重的自然灾害和苏修背信弃义的破坏活动所造成的种种困难，取得了伟大的成就。这是任何人都否认不了的历史事实。中国赫鲁晓夫把我国七亿人民所进行的伟大事业，说得“漆黑一团”，一无是处，难道这叫“实事求是”吗！毛主席说：“对于革命的文艺家，暴露的对象，只能是侵略者、剥削者、压迫者及其在人民中所遗留的恶劣影响，而不能是人民大众。……除非是反革命文艺家，才有所谓人民是
  ‘天生愚蠢的’，革命群众是‘专制暴徒’之类的描写。”一切反革命的宣传，都是打着所谓“客观”“公正”、所谓“真实”的幌子向无产阶级进攻的。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“客观”、“公正”，就是“揭露”。他拚命叫嚷要“揭露”，并且要“揭露”得“漆黑一团”，决不是为了什么“真实”，什么“客观”、“公正”，而是攻其一点，不及其余，利用我国三年经济困难，疯狂地攻击毛主席的革命路线，丑化共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，瓦解人民对共产主义前途的胜利信心，为复辟资本主义作舆论准备。试看当时充斥报刊的《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》之类的东西，不统统都是这一类货色吗！
    一切剥削阶级由其反动的阶级本性决定，他们的报纸决不可能做到客观、公正，他们只能靠造谣撒谎过日子。无产阶级才真正代表着绝大多数人的最高利益，无产阶级报纸以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南，因而能够深刻地阐明社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度的客观规律，揭露帝、修、反一切罪恶活动的本质，对各种社会现象作出最正确最深刻的科学论断。抛弃坚定的无产阶级立场，背叛马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，而叫嚷什么“客观”、“公正”，统统都是欺人之谈。在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级的
    “客观”、“公正”论，实质上是一个媚敌降敌、为敌张目的反动口号，我们一定要把它彻底批倒批臭。
