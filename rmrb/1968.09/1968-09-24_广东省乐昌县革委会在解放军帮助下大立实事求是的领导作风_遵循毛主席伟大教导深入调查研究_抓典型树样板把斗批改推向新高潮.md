The Revolutionary Committee of Lechang County, Guangdong Province, with the help of the PLA, has established a pragmatic leadership style, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, conducting in-depth investigations, and promoting model examples to push the struggle, criticism, and transformation to new heights.

Editor's Note: The editorial of the "Red Flag" magazine, which represents the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, says: "Hopefully, the revolutionary committees will organize some people to conduct typical investigations." The Revolutionary Committee of Lechang County is doing just that in their work. They conduct in-depth investigations and seriously promote the experiences of model examples, which is very worthy of attention.

In the brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods," Chairman Mao pointed out when commending the work of the comrades in Xingguo County: "They are seriously working there, and they are carefully solving problems." The work of the Revolutionary Committee of Lechang County is also serious and meticulous. When implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement throughout the county, they do not limit themselves to general calls. Instead, they combine Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the specific conditions of their region and units, conduct in-depth investigations, discover model examples, summarize experiences, and guide the overall work. In this way, they ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented smoothly in their region, and their work is solid and in-depth, steadily improving.

In the current struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is particularly important for us to conduct model investigations to promote various tasks more quickly and effectively!

The Revolutionary Committee of Lechang County, Guangdong Province, with the help of the 189th Hospital, an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works under the Guangzhou Military Region, and the county's Military Affairs Department, has followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "Any leader who does not obtain specific experiences from the lower levels, individual units, and individual events cannot provide universal guidance to all units." At this critical juncture in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have broken away from the bureaucratic and subjective leadership styles of the bourgeoisie, established Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy for a pragmatic leadership style, conducted in-depth investigations, and used model examples to promote work. They have ensured that Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are implemented smoothly and quickly, effectively promoting the "three loyalties" activities, large-scale criticism, class purification, party rectification, and streamlining of organizations throughout the county. These activities have been carried out with great enthusiasm and solid results, pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation to new heights.

Promoting Model Examples to Further Develop the Good Situation

In January, when the county's Revolutionary Committee was first established, most grassroots units were still fragmented, each doing their own thing, and each having their own center, seriously obstructing the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. How to help the masses quickly achieve revolutionary unity and establish a revolutionary three-in-one combination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment? Initially, some members were busy with meetings, busy running around gathering information, and busy persuading people everywhere, resulting in a situation where there were many meetings, few points of focus, much general information gathering, few model investigations, much general talk, and few summaries and promotions of advanced experiences in the region. As a result, the calls remained on paper, the requirements remained on paper, and the implementation remained on paper. The progress of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination was slow.

After discovering this problem, the military representatives of the Revolutionary Committee immediately organized all committee members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on thought and work methods repeatedly, summarizing their own lessons from not having focused on points, not having direct access to first-hand materials, not having established model examples, not having the energy to speak, not being able to command, and not having the strength to lead. This made everyone deeply realize that whether or not to focus on points and use model examples is not just a matter of work methods; it is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao and whether the Revolutionary Committee can lead the people of the county to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

After raising awareness, the county's Revolutionary Committee, except for leaving two standing committee members on duty, sent all members to the grassroots level to conduct in-depth investigations and research. They summarized the experiences of Jiufeng, Langtian, and Pingshi communes in carrying out the "three loyalties" activities, conducting large-scale class education and situation education, focusing on class struggle, overcoming bourgeois factionalism, and achieving revolutionary unity. These experiences, when presented to the masses, had a strong call to action and persuasive power, immediately promoting a high tide of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the county. In less than half a month, the entire county achieved a red tide in both urban and rural areas.

After experiencing the sweet taste of focusing on model examples, most committee members became more self-aware in conducting in-depth investigations and focusing on model examples. However, some members also developed some active thoughts, fearing that focusing on points would not yield experiences, fearing that focusing on points would not produce model examples, and fearing that long-term focusing on points would be too hard on their bodies. The military representatives of the Revolutionary Committee immediately realized that these active thoughts reflected the struggle between the two lines, two leadership styles, and two worldviews. Without thoroughly eliminating the poison of the revisionist line on power construction by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy for a revolutionary leadership style of concentrating from the masses and persisting among the masses would not be established, and it would not be possible to lead the people of the county to continuously advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee held another Mao Zedong Thought study class, thoroughly criticizing the old county committee's clique of capitalist roaders who faithfully executed Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line on power construction, long-term implementing the "five nos": not connecting with the masses, not going deep into the grassroots, not conducting investigations and research, not summarizing experiences, and not focusing on living models; and implementing the "five relies": relying on reports, relying on documents, relying on phone calls, relying on old methods, and relying on coercion to get by. They discussed the new situation, new tasks, and new requirements at this critical moment in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, making everyone more deeply realize that whether or not to focus on model examples is a key issue in whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions vigorously and smoothly, do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, continuously develop the good situation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. Without focusing on model examples, one would not obtain direct knowledge, would not grasp first-hand materials, and the guidance of work would be aimless; organizing movements would be aimless. Without focusing on model examples, one would not be able to produce model examples that play a leading role, and one would not be able to make the mass movement both enthusiastic and solid.

From then on, everyone's self-awareness in focusing on model examples greatly increased. Over the past eight months, from the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee to each committee member, everyone carried their luggage and walked to more than ten brigades to focus on points. All 164 brigades in the county, as well as factories and forest farms, have had standing committee members from the Revolutionary Committee visit. They went to every place and firmly ensured that they were with the masses in six ways: eating, living, working, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, struggling against selfishness and revisionism, and discussing. Sanxi Commune is the most remote commune in the county, where class struggle is complex and transportation is inconvenient. After liberation, the old county committee's clique of capitalist roaders rarely went there. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Political Commissar of the County Military Affairs Department, Comrade Han Xichang, carried his luggage and went deep into that area, and together with the militia and commune members, set up a study class, making this commune quickly advance from a backward unit to a vanguard unit. Comrade Wang Guili, a member of the county's Revolutionary Committee and Political Commissar of the County Military Affairs Department, who is an active member of the Guangzhou Military Region in studying Chairman Mao's works, spends 80% of his time fighting in the countryside. Since this year, he has walked to more than 40 brigades. Since last year, he has run through every commune and most brigades in the county. Under the leadership of the county's Revolutionary Committee, almost all cadres above the brigade level in the county have focused on points, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and making the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the county better and better.

Through Establishing Model Examples to Gain the Right to Speak in Leading Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out that we must seriously do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. How can we lead the mass struggle, criticism, and transformation high tide in a planned and purposeful manner?

For a period of time, some communes' revolutionary large-scale criticism was generalized. Some commune members reflected that the large-scale criticism was like reheating old dishes, and the more they criticized, the less enthusiastic the masses became. The leadership of the Revolutionary Committee immediately convened a standing committee meeting in response to this situation. Everyone deeply realized that without focusing on model examples in the region and summarizing specific experiences in the region, it would be impossible to correctly and strongly lead the region. The members of the Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "If you want to know the taste of pears, you must change the pears and taste them yourself," carried their luggage and went deep into mountain areas, forest areas, and plain areas of three different communes to conduct specialized investigations and research on revolutionary large-scale criticism, grasping first-hand materials, and truly gaining the right to lead revolutionary large-scale criticism. They fundamentally changed the past practice of not combining with local characteristics, mechanically copying large-scale criticism experiences from other provinces and counties, overcame the phenomenon of large-scale criticism being a mere formality, and promoted the in-depth development of revolutionary large-scale criticism, achieving immediate results.

At the beginning of the class purification movement, some commune members thought: the class boundaries in the countryside are the clearest, and the enemies are the most distinct, so there is nothing to purify. The situation did not open up. Why? At this time, the Revolutionary Committee, on the one hand, conducted large-scale propaganda, education, and mobilization; on the other hand, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee personally went to the most remote and intense areas of class struggle to conduct serious investigations and on-site research, understand the active thoughts of the commune members, and summarize the experiences of class purification in the countryside. A brigade in Jiufeng Commune had a very complex social situation. In the early days of liberation, there were many remnants of the Kuomintang. The county's Revolutionary Committee member and deputy director of the County Military Affairs Department, Comrade Jiao Cunzhong, and the vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and deputy commander of the militia regiment, Comrade Cao Shaoliang, together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and militia, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and the latest instructions, and on the basis of improving class vigilance, quickly exposed a group of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. After the class enemies were exposed, they mobilized the masses to use these people as living materials, closely combining revolutionary large-scale criticism with class purification work, and combining it with the elimination of Liu Shaoqi's "class struggle extinction" theory, making the struggle against the enemy deepen step by step, and the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the militia and commune members quickly improve.

After gaining experience, the county's Revolutionary Committee immediately held an on-site meeting on class purification and the struggle against the enemy in this place, using living model examples to solve the active thoughts of cadres and masses, answering various new questions about the struggle against the enemy and class purification in the countryside, and effectively promoting the in-depth development of class purification work throughout the county.

After the class purification work was carried out in depth, some units, due to the instigation and provocation of class enemies, appeared chaotic and indiscriminate struggles. Some grassroots Revolutionary Committee members did not dare to boldly implement the party's policies, mistakenly thinking that propagating the party's policies was restricting the masses' hands and feet. At this time, the members of the county's Revolutionary Committee brought this problem to the Woodworking Factory to dissect the "sparrow," investigate the active thoughts of cadres and masses in implementing the party's policies, and summarize and promote the experience of the factory's Revolutionary Committee in arming the masses with the party's policies, deeply doing ideological work among the deceived masses, and politically attacking criminals, repeatedly foiling the various schemes of the class enemies, finally exposing a small group of class enemies. They clarified the various blurred understandings of cadres and masses, helping everyone to clearly distinguish between good people making mistakes and bad people committing crimes, being deceived by the enemy to do bad things and personally plotting to do bad things, making mistakes and being willing to repent versus insisting on not changing. This made the party's policies further penetrate the hearts of the people and fully demonstrate the power of the party's policies. Those who originally thought that "propagating the party's policies is restricting the masses' hands and feet" deeply felt that arming the masses with the party's policies is the best way to mobilize the masses and fundamentally mobilize the masses.

Using Model Examples to Continuously Organize New High Tides of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Lechang County has always followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "From the masses, to the masses," conducted in-depth investigations to discover and cultivate various model examples, used the experiences of model examples to promote the movement on the surface; in the process of promoting the experiences of model examples, they continuously brought the problems on the surface to the points to find solutions, and then promoted them, achieving results on the points and on the surface, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation high tide in the county one wave higher than the last.

In early April, after the class purification work was carried out, the movement in the county developed very unevenly. Some units had heavy rightist thoughts and did not mobilize the masses effectively; some units were satisfied with exposing some surface-level class enemies and were not good at deeply criticizing and digging out. At this time, the county's Revolutionary Committee timely organized two advanced units in the struggle against the enemy to form a roving reporting team to report to various places, making the struggle against the enemy and class purification work in the county develop step by step. This county has a small town that is the gateway to Hunan and Jiangxi. Before liberation, this small town was the northern Guangdong intelligence center of the Kuomintang. In the early days of liberation, a group of Kuomintang remnants from all over the country came here, changed their names, and hid. Many people from other provinces and cities interfered with the Cultural Revolution movement there. This town was the last unit in the county to establish a Revolutionary Committee, a "difficult" unit. In the early stages of the class purification movement, some members of the town's Revolutionary Committee were afraid, saying that this was a "wasp's nest." In response to this situation, Vice-Chairman of the county's Revolutionary Committee and Director of the Political Department of the 189th Hospital, Comrade Jiang Zhiqie, immediately led a reporting team composed of advanced units in the struggle against the enemy from the Guangdong Provincial Installation Company and Chengguan Town and other units to go deep into this town. On the one hand, they helped the town's Revolutionary Committee to set up a specialized study class on the struggle against the enemy, strongly criticize rightist thoughts, and establish the idea of struggling against the enemy; on the other hand, they propagated door-to-door and introduced the experiences and feelings of the struggle against the enemy to each unit, making the entire town, from top to bottom, unify their understanding, unify their steps, and unify their actions, quickly forming a high tide of struggle against the enemy. In less than half a month, they exposed a group of traitors, spies, and Kuomintang remnants who had hidden their counter-revolutionary history for decades without any archival clues, consolidated the Revolutionary Committee, and greatly developed the good situation. Then, they widely propagated the new experiences of this town, making the entire county launch a new high tide of struggle against the enemy.

In May, in the early stages of the mass party rectification movement, the situation did not open up for a long time. The county's Revolutionary Committee brought this problem to form three teams, going deep into the Maoping Brigade of Beixiang Commune, the county bank, and the plywood factory on the three fronts of rural areas, organs, and factories to conduct serious investigations, finding that the fundamental obstacle to the development of the movement was the "three don't cares" mentality. Leading cadres thought they were the objects of rectification and did not care about the movement; general party members thought party rectification was the business of the Revolutionary Committee and did not care about the movement; non-party masses thought party rectification was the business of party members and did not care about the movement. Then, they set up various types of study classes, taking the approach of studying Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist party-building line, and emphasizing the great significance of building the Communist Party of China into an "organization of advanced elements of the proletariat that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against class enemies, a vigorous vanguard organization," promoting the development of the party rectification movement. After finding successful experiences, they immediately held an on-site meeting to vigorously promote them, making the party rectification movement in the county quickly open up a new situation. After the movement was launched, the Revolutionary Committee found that many units had disconnected party rectification from revolutionary large-scale criticism and the struggle against the enemy and class purification. At this time, the members of the county's Revolutionary Committee went to these three units again to find solutions to the problems, held another on-site meeting to summarize and promote experiences, quickly corrected various deviations in the party rectification process throughout the county, and continuously pushed the party rectification work in the county to new heights.

Recently, in the work of comprehensively streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office personnel, the county's Revolutionary Committee is conducting serious investigations and research, preparing to establish some new model examples to guide the overall work.

    广东省乐昌县革委会在解放军帮助下大立实事求是的领导作风
    遵循毛主席伟大教导深入调查研究  抓典型树样板把斗批改推向新高潮
    编者按：代表我们伟大领袖毛主席声音的《红旗》杂志编者按语说：“希望各地革命委员会组织一些人做些典型的调查”。乐昌县革委会在自己的工作中正是这样做的。他们深入调查研究，认真抓好典型的经验，很值得重视。
    毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作中，在表彰兴国县同志们的模范工作时，曾经指出：“他们是认真地在那里进行工作，他们是仔细地在那里解决问题”。乐昌县革委会的工作，同样也是认真的、仔细的。他们在贯彻执行毛主席最新指示，推动全县斗、批、改运动时，不是限于一般号召，而是把伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和本地区本单位的具体情况结合起来，深入调查，发现典型，总结经验，指导全盘。这样，他们就保证了毛主席的最新指示在本地区畅通无阻地执行，他们那里的工作就做得扎实深入，蒸蒸日上。
    在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，特别需要我们做好典型调查，把各项工作更快、更好地推向前进！
    本报讯　广东省乐昌县革命委员会在广州军区学习毛主席著作先进单位一八九医院和县武装部的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导”的教导，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的决战关头，大破资产阶级官僚主义、主观主义的领导作风，大立毛主席一贯倡导的实事求是的领导作风，深入调查研究，运用典型推动工作。坚持做到在“点”上解剖“麻雀”；到“点”上扶植新生事物；到“点”上总结推广经验，保证毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，畅通无阻，迅速贯彻，有力地推动全县“三忠于”活动，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构等各项工作既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实地开展，使斗、批、改高潮一浪高过一浪。
    抓好典型，进一步发展大好形势
    今年一月，县革委会刚成立时，全县多数基层单位还是“山头”林立，各自为政，各为“中心”，严重地阻碍毛主席最新指示的全面落实。怎样帮助群众迅速实现革命大联合，建立革命三结合，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署呢？起初，有的成员忙于开会，忙于整天跑情况，忙于到处去游说，形成开会多，蹲点少；抓一般情况多，搞典型调查少；讲一般道理多，总结推广本地区先进单位的先进经验少的“三多三少”局面。结果，号召停留在会上，要求停留在纸上，落实停留在嘴上，革命大联合和革命三结合进展很慢。
    革委会军队代表发现这一问题后，立即组织全体委员带着问题反复学习毛主席有关思想方法和工作方法等教导，总结自己由于没有蹲点，没有直接掌握第一手材料，没有树立样板，说话没劲，指挥不灵，领导无力的教训。使大家深刻认识到：抓不抓点，运用不运用典型，这不是一般的工作方法问题，这是对毛主席忠不忠的大问题，是关系到革委会能否率领全县人民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利的大问题。
    认识提高以后，县革委会除留二名常委在家值班外，全部分头下到基层，深入调查研究，总结了九峰、廊田、坪石等公社开展“三忠于”活动，大搞阶级教育和形势教育，狠抓阶级斗争，克服资产阶级派性，实现革命大联合的经验。这些经验一与群众见面，号召力大，说服力强，立即推动了全县革命大联合和革命三结合形成高潮，不到半个月时间，全县就实现城乡一片红。
    狠抓典型，尝到了甜头，大多数委员深入调查研究，抓典型的自觉性更高了。但是，也有少数成员因此而产生了一些活思想，怕蹲点搞不出经验，面子难看；怕蹲点拿不出样板，不好交账；怕长期蹲点，生活艰苦搞垮身体。革委会的军队代表，立即意识到，这些活思想是两条路线、两种领导作风、两种世界观斗争的反映。不彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设问题上的流毒，毛主席一贯倡导的从群众中集中起来，到群众中坚持下去的革命化的领导作风就立不起来，就不可能率领全县人民把无产阶级文化大革命运动不断向前推进。于是，革委会再次举办毛泽东思想专题学习班，大摆大批旧县委内一小撮走资派忠实地执行中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设问题上的修正主义路线，在旧机关长期推行五不：不联系群众，不深入基层，不调查研究，不总结经验，不抓活典型；实行“五靠”：靠听汇报，靠发文件，靠打电话，靠吃老本，靠以势压人过日子的官僚作风的危害，大谈在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻的新形势、新情况、新任务、新要求。使大家更加深刻地认识到：抓不抓典型，是能不能雷厉风行，通行无阻地落实毛主席一系列最新指示，搞好斗、批、改，不断发展大好形势，夺取文化大革命全面胜利的关键问题。不抓典型，就得不到直接知识，掌握不到第一手材料，指导工作就无的放矢，组织运动就心中无数；不抓典型，就拿不出起带头作用的样板，就不能使群众运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
    从此，大家狠抓典型的自觉性大大提高。八个月来，从革委会主任到每个委员，都背上行李，徒步深入十个以上的大队去蹲点。全县一百六十四个大队以及工厂、林场都有革委会的常委到过。他们到每个地方，都坚决做到和群众六同：同吃，同住，同劳动，同学习毛主席最新指示，同斗私批修，同商量。三溪公社是全县最边远的公社，那里阶级斗争复杂，交通不便。解放后旧县委一小撮走资派很少到那里。革委会成立之后，革委会主任、县武装部政委韩希昌同志背上行李深入那里，和民兵、社员一起办学习班，使这个公社由后进单位很快跃进到先进行列。广州军区学习毛主席著作积极分子、革委会常委、县武装部部长王桂礼同志，百分之八十的时间战斗在农村。今年以来，他徒步走了四十多个大队。自去年介入地方文化大革命以来，他跑完了全县每个公社和绝大部分大队。在县革委会的带动下，全县大队以上干部，几乎人人有点，人人蹲点，有力地保证了毛主席一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，使全县文化大革命运动形势越来越好。
    通过树立典型取得指导斗、批、改的发言权
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出，要认真搞好斗、批、改。怎样才能做到有计划、有目的地领导好群众性的斗、批、改高潮呢？
    有一段时间，有些公社的革命大批判搞得一般化。有些社员反映大批判是炒冷饭，越批群众劲头越小。革委会的领导针对这种情况，立即召开常委会议。大家深刻认识到，不抓本地区的典型，不总结本地区的具体经验，就没法对本地区实行正确有力的领导。革委会成员遵照毛主席关于“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃”的教导，背上行囊，分别深入山区、林区和平原区三种不同地区的公社，对革命大批判进行专题调查研究，掌握了第一手材料，真正取得了指导革命大批判的领导权，从根本上改变了过去不结合本地特点，生搬硬套外省外县大批判经验的毛病，克服了大批判“走过场”的现象，推动了革命大批判的深入开展，取得了立竿见影的效果。
    在刚开展清理阶级队伍的时候，有的社员认为：农村敌我界限最清，敌我最分明，没什么可清。运动局面一下打不开。原因何在？这时革委会一面深入开展大宣传，大教育，大发动；另方面，革委会主任、副主任亲自深入到阶级斗争最尖锐、最边远的山区去认真调查，实地研究，摸清社员的活思想，总结出农村清理阶级队伍的经验。九峰公社一个大队，社会情况非常复杂。解放初期，遗留下来的国民党残渣余孽也较多。县革委会委员、县武装部副部长焦存忠和县革委会副主任、该队民兵营副营长曹绍良同志和广大贫下中农、民兵一起反复学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和最新指示，在提高阶级警惕性的基础上，很快揪出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子。阶级敌人揪出后，又发动群众，以这些人为活材料，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密结合起来，和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒结合起来，使对敌斗争步步深入，民兵、社员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高。
    取得经验后，县革委会立即在这里召开清理阶级队伍、开展对敌斗争现场会，运用活样板，解决干部、群众的活思想，回答农村开展对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍的各种新问题，有力地推动了全县清理阶级队伍工作的深入开展。
    清理阶级队伍深入开展以后，有的单位由于阶级敌人煽动挑拨，出现乱揪乱斗的现象。有些基层革委会成员不敢大胆执行党的政策，错误地认为宣传党的政策，是束缚群众手脚。这时，县革委会成员又带着这个问题，到木器厂解剖“麻雀”，调查干部、群众在执行党的政策过程中有什么活思想，并总结推广这个厂革委会坚持用党的政策武装群众，深入做受蒙蔽群众的思想工作，对犯罪分子进行政策攻心，一次又一次地粉碎阶级敌人的种种阴谋，终于把一小撮阶级敌人挖了出来的经验，澄清了干部、群众的种种模糊认识，帮助大家明确地划清了好人犯错误与坏人犯罪，受敌人蒙蔽干坏事与亲自主谋干坏事，犯了错误愿意改悔与坚持不改等界限。使党的政策进一步深入人心，充分发挥党的政策的威力。原来认为“宣传党的政策，是束缚群众手脚”的同志，深有体会地说：用党的政策武装群众，是最好的发动群众，是从根本上发动群众。
    运用典型不断组织斗、批、改的新高潮
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗过程中，乐昌县革命委员会始终遵照毛主席关于“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，深入调查发现和培养各种典型，用典型的经验推动面上的运动；在推广典型经验过程中，又不断地带着面上的问题到点上找解决的办法，然后再推广，做到点上开花，面上结果，使全县斗、批、改高潮一浪高过一浪。
    今年四月初，清理阶级队伍工作开展以后，全县运动发展很不平衡。有些单位革命委员会右倾思想较重，发动群众不力；有的单位满足于揪斗一些浮在面上的阶级敌人，不善于狠批深挖。这时，县革委会及时组织了两个对敌斗争先进单位巡回报告团到各地巡回报告，使全县对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍工作步步向纵深发展。这个县有一个小镇，是通往湖南、江西的门户。解放前，这个小镇是国民党的粤北情报中心，解放初，从全国逃来了一批国民党的残渣余孽，改名换姓，潜伏了下来。有不少外省外地的人插手那里的文化大革命运动。这个镇是全县最后成立革委会的“老大难”单位。开展清理阶级队伍初期，镇革委会有的成员“怕”字当头，说什么这不是“马蜂窝”。针对这种情况，县革委会副主任、一八九医院政治处主任姜志杰同志立即带领由广东省驻该县安装公司和城关镇等单位组成的对敌斗争先进单位报告团深入该镇。一方面帮助镇革委会办好对敌斗争专题学习班，大反右倾，树立对敌斗争的思想；另方面挨家逐户宣传，一个一个单位地深入介绍对敌斗争的经验体会，使全镇上上下下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，很快形成了一个对敌斗争的高潮。不到半个月时间，就挖出了一批隐瞒几十年反革命历史的毫无档案线索的叛徒、特务和国民党的残渣余孽，巩固了革命委员会，大大发展了大好形势。然后又广泛宣传该镇的新经验，使全县掀起了一个新的对敌斗争高潮。
    今年五月，全县群众性的整党建党运动开展初期，运动局面很长一段时间打不开，县革委会就带着这个问题组成三个组，分别深入北乡公社茅坪大队、县银行、胶合板厂等农村、机关、工厂三条战线认真调查，找到了阻碍运动开展的根本障碍就是“三不管”的思想，领导干部认为自己是挨整对象，对运动不管；一般党员认为整党是革委会的事，对运动不管；非党员群众认为整党是党员的事，对运动也不管。然后，大办各种类型的学习班，采取大学毛主席的有关教导，大批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线，大讲把中国共产党建设成为一个“应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的伟大意义，推动了整党运动的开展。找到了成功经验后，立即召开现场会，大力推广，使全县整党建党运动很快打开一个崭新局面。运动开展后，革委会又发现有不少单位整党建党与革命大批判脱节，与开展对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍脱节。这时县革委会成员又分头再到这三个单位找解决问题的办法，再次召开现场会总结推广经验，迅速纠正了全县整党过程中的各种偏向，把全县整党建党工作不断推向新的高潮。
    最近，在全面开展精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，下放科室人员的工作中，县革委会正在认真调查研究，准备树立一些新的样板以指导全盘。  乐武　齐颂阳　韶合
