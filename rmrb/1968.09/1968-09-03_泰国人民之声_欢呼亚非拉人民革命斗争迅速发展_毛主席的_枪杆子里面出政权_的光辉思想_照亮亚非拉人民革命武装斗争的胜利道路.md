The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad.

The Voice of the Thai People hails the rapid development of revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" illuminates the victorious path of armed revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. A new world without imperialism, without oppression and exploitation, will be born amidst the revolutionary gunfire of the peoples of the world.

New China News Agency: The Voice of the Thai People radio station recently published an article stating that under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rapidly developing, and reports of victories in people's revolutionary wars are frequently heard.

The article published by the Voice of the Thai People radio station says that under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the great storm of people's armed struggles is sweeping across the entire Asian continent. The revolutionary gunfire of the peoples of Thailand, South Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palestine resounds around the world, like thunderous claps of thunder, strongly shaking the reactionary rule of U.S.-led imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

The article says that under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the patriotic people of Thailand are bravely waging armed struggles and have achieved a great situation. In just three years, the Thai people's armed forces have rapidly grown, expanding the areas of armed struggle from the northeast to the south, north, and central regions. Currently, the banner of the Thai people's armed struggle is flying high in the vast areas of thirty provinces and is achieving even greater victories day by day.

The article goes on to say that 14 million people in South Vietnam are persistently fighting the anti-American rescue war, launching fierce attacks on more than 120,000 American bandit troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops, making them frantic and desperate. The heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people has set a brilliant example for all oppressed peoples and nations around the world who are fighting for liberation.

Three million people in Laos, using the invincible power of people's war, bravely attack U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Laos, annihilating a large number of enemy forces and liberating an area covering two-thirds of the country.

Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the Burmese people frequently attack the enemy, using Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics of people's war, and continuously expand revolutionary base areas.

Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people have summed up past experiences, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking the path of armed struggle, using the countryside to surround the cities, rapidly developing revolutionary forces, and have already established revolutionary base areas in the countryside.

The peoples of Malaya and the Philippines are persistently waging armed struggles.

The Palestinian guerrilla forces, full of patriotic revolutionary spirit, are becoming stronger and stronger, continuously achieving victories, and increasingly fiercely striking at U.S. imperialism and the Israeli aggressors.

The article points out that the armed struggles of the peoples of various Asian countries are a great storm that seriously shakes the rule of U.S.-led imperialism and reactionaries. It promotes the rapid development of the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia and the world, accelerating the complete liberation of oppressed peoples and nations.

The article says that the great victories of the armed struggles of the peoples of Asia are the great victories of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The revolutionary peoples of Asia deeply understand that in the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and reactionaries, if armed struggle is abandoned, the people cannot achieve victory.

Another article published by the Voice of the Thai People radio station says that Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses and is achieving great victories. The flames of revolutionary armed struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning fiercely, and the triumphant songs of people's revolutionary wars are frequently heard.

The article says that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people waged a revolutionary war that lasted 22 years, the most intense, arduous, and complex, accumulating extremely rich revolutionary experience in using the gun to overthrow imperialism and its running dogs and establish people's political power.

The article points out that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war has opened up a bright path for the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It provides valuable experience for the revolutionary peoples of various countries to fight against the heavily armed enemy—U.S.-led imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries: without the people's army and without armed struggle, the people will have nothing, and there will be no revolutionary victory. Imperialism and all reactionary ruling classes occupy the cities, but they cannot control the vast countryside. Therefore, revolutionary parties and revolutionary peoples must fully utilize the enemy's weak points, mobilize the rural masses, wage guerrilla warfare, establish solid revolutionary base areas, accumulate, temper, and develop their own strength, and use the countryside to surround the cities, ultimately seizing the cities.

The article says that currently, the conditions for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to wage armed struggles against imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are very good. First, there is Mao Zedong Thought, a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and there is a powerful People's Republic of China as a reliable force to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. In addition, the revolutionary consciousness of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world is increasingly heightened, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world are increasingly developing, heavily striking at U.S.-led imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and making them increasingly isolated.

The article emphasizes that although the armed struggles of the peoples of various countries will still go through a difficult and tortuous path, under the radiant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of various countries will wage tenacious and unyielding struggles, and the final victory will definitely belong to the people. A new world without imperialism, without oppression and exploitation, will be born amidst the revolutionary gunfire of the peoples of the world.

    革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。  毛泽东
    “泰国人民之声”欢呼亚非拉人民革命斗争迅速发展
    毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想
    照亮亚非拉人民革命武装斗争的胜利道路
    一个没有帝国主义，没有压迫、剥削的新世界必将在世界人民的革命枪声中诞生
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台最近发表文章指出，在伟大领袖毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想的指引下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争正在迅速发展，人民革命战争的捷报频传。
    “泰国人民之声”电台发表的文章说，在毛泽东思想光辉普照下，人民武装斗争的伟大风暴正在席卷着整个亚洲。泰国、越南南方、老挝、缅甸、马来亚、印度尼西亚、菲律宾和巴勒斯坦等地人民的革命枪声响彻寰宇，犹如震天动地的霹雳巨雷，强烈地震撼着以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的反动统治。
    文章说，在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党领导下，泰国爱国人民英勇地进行武装斗争，打出了一片大好形势。在短短的三年时间里，泰国人民武装迅速壮大，把武装斗争地区从东北部扩大到南部、北部和中部。目前，泰国人民武装斗争的旗帜已经在三十个府的广大地区高高飘扬，并且正在日益取得更加伟大的胜利。
    文章接着说，一千四百万越南南方人民坚持抗美救国战争，再接再厉地向一百二十多万美国强盗兵、伪军和帮凶军发动猛烈的进攻，打得它们焦头烂额，走投无路。越南南方人民的英勇斗争，给全世界为争取解放而斗争的被压迫人民和被压迫民族，树立了光辉的榜样。
    三百万老挝人民运用了威力无穷的人民战争，英勇地进攻美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗，大量歼灭了敌人有生力量，解放了占全国三分之二面积的土地。
    缅甸人民在缅甸共产党领导下，运用毛泽东主席关于人民战争的战略战术，频繁袭击敌人，不断扩大革命根据地。
    印度尼西亚共产党领导下的印度尼西亚人民，总结了过去的经验教训，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走武装斗争的道路，用农村包围城市，迅速地发展了革命力量，并且已在农村建立起革命根据地。
    马来亚和菲律宾等地的人民正在坚持武装斗争。
    充满爱国革命精神的巴勒斯坦游击队越战越强，不断取得胜利，日益猛烈地打击美帝国主义和以色列侵略者。
    文章指出，亚洲各国人民的武装斗争，是严重震荡着以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派的伟大风暴。它推动了亚洲人民和世界人民革命运动迅速向前发展，加速了被压迫人民和被压迫民族的彻底解放早日到来。
    文章说，亚洲人民武装斗争的伟大胜利，是毛泽东主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想的伟大胜利。亚洲革命人民深深懂得，同以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派作斗争，如果离开了武装斗争，人民就不能取得胜利。
    “泰国人民之声”电台发表的另一篇文章说，毛泽东主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想正越来越深入广大革命人民心中，并且正在取得伟大的胜利。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命武装斗争烽火正在熊熊燃烧，人民革命战争的凯歌频传。
    文章说，在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，中国人民进行了历时二十二年之久的最激烈、最艰苦、最复杂的革命战争，积累了用枪杆子推翻帝国主义及其走狗，建立人民政权的极其丰富的革命经验。
    文章指出，中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，为全世界人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民开辟了光明的道路。它向各国革命人民提供了同武装到牙齿的敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派进行斗争的宝贵经验：如果没有人民的军队和离开武装斗争，就没有人民的一切，就没有革命的胜利。帝国主义和一切反动统治阶级占领着城市，但是它们不能够控制广大的农村。因此，革命的政党和革命的人民，必须充分利用敌人的薄弱环节，动员农村群众，进行游击战争，建立巩固的革命根据地，以便积蓄、锻炼和发展自己的力量，并且用农村包围城市，最后夺取城市。
    文章说，当前，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民进行反对帝国主义和各国反动派的武装斗争的条件好得很。首先，是有毛泽东思想这一反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器，有强大的中华人民共和国作为支援各国人民革命斗争的可靠力量。此外，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的革命觉悟日益提高，全世界人民的革命斗争日益发展，沉重地打击着以美国为首的帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，并使它们越来越陷于孤立。
    文章强调指出，尽管各国人民的武装斗争还要经历一段艰苦、曲折的道路，但是，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，各国人民进行顽强不屈的斗争，最后的胜利一定属于人民。一个没有帝国主义，没有压迫、剥削的新世界，必将在全世界人民的革命枪声中诞生。
