	The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist) condemns the Soviet revisionists' brazen invasion of Czechoslovakia. The working class and people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries are resolutely fighting back. They will sweep away all modern revisionist groups.

	Rome, September 6th—The organ of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist), the newspaper *Nuova Unità*, published on August 24th a statement from the Party's Political Bureau condemning the Soviet revisionist clique's brazen invasion of Czechoslovakia.

	The statement points out that the root cause of this event lies in the fact that "the chief culprit, the Khrushchev leadership clique, seized power in the Soviet state, using the prestige of the past Bolshevik Party and the wealth of the Soviet state to support the degeneration of revisionism, establishing a revisionist-bourgeois regime in the countries of Eastern Europe that had already become people's democracies. The Soviet revisionist clique uses every means to make the bourgeois restoration line prevail. It defames socialist achievements and plots to make all communist fighters in the world lose their way, denying the universal significance of Marxism-Leninism, spreading the deceitful talk of the peaceful road and the parliamentary road. Khrushchev attacked the great revolutionary image of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU. (The Soviet revisionist clique) implements a policy of great-power chauvinism, exerting political, economic, and military pressure and blackmail on other countries, increasingly colluding with American imperialism to divide the world into spheres of influence to obstruct the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

	"The revisionist clique has seized the leadership in a series of countries—where the proletariat had fought for the class struggle to build socialism—establishing a revisionist-bourgeois regime in all fields. The economy has been transformed to a capitalist base, forming an exploiting class; lifestyle, habits, and culture gradually take on the color of the bourgeois regime; foreign policy is incorporated into the Soviet-American alliance."

	The statement exposes the Soviet revisionist clique's pretext of "defending the socialism of Czechoslovakia" as an attempt to cover up its naked aggression. The statement says: "Is it not the 22nd Congress of the CPSU that determined the all-people's state—that is, in a socialist state there are no longer classes and class struggle? This shows (the Soviet revisionist leadership clique) uses this theory to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat."

	The statement says: "Isn't the theory of the all-people's party precisely what was determined at the (CPSU) 22nd Congress? This is not to deny the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's party. This means abolishing the Bolshevik Party. Therefore, the cause of the Czechoslovakian revisionist degeneration should be sought in the Soviet revisionist degeneration."

	The statement points out that the actions of the modern revisionist clique centered on the Soviet Union can only lead to the re-emergence of typical contradictions of the bourgeois regime within the countries of revisionism and their relations. In the specific case of Czechoslovakia, the competing cliques all claim to defend socialism; in reality, this is competition within the scope of the common revisionist-bourgeois line.

	The statement then emphasizes: "Today, the defense of the cause of socialism and communism, the treasure trove of proletarian internationalism, and the banner of Marxism-Leninism is being held high by the People's Republic of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, dedicated to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the world revolutionary stronghold; it is being held high by Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, advancing the revolutionary development in the fields of ideology and culture and advancing socialist construction with great achievements, the beacon of European socialism; it is being held high by the Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations developing all over the world."

	The statement says that at present, a profound crisis is shaking the entire revisionist-imperialist camp, providing new possibilities for Marxist-Leninists all over the world to more effectively carry out the struggle against imperialism, against the bourgeoisie, and against modern revisionism. The working class and people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries ruled by revisionists should prepare and launch an increasingly resolute struggle against modern revisionism to sweep away all revisionist cliques and re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. "All Marxist-Leninist parties in the world should increasingly expand their ranks, march forward under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the great banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, under the great banner of the highest creative embodiment of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought."

	The statement says that the line of surrender to American imperialism pursued by the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique has made the workers realize more deeply the harm that revisionism brings to the revolutionary movement. The working class, peasants, and revolutionary youth will not be deceived. All members and organizations of our party have been mobilized to work and struggle, to increasingly unite with the masses, expose the plots of all Italian revisionists, defeat the plots of the reactionaries and imperialists, and win the broadest masses of the people to the glorious and invincible cause of Marxism-Leninism.

    意共（马列）政治局谴责苏修悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克 
    苏捷等国工人阶级和人民坚决斗争
    把所有现代修正主义集团一扫而光
    新华社六日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《新团结报》八月二十四日刊登了党的政治局的公报，谴责苏修叛徒集团悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克。
    公报指出，发生这一事件的根源在于：“赫鲁晓夫领导集团这个罪魁祸首篡夺了苏维埃国家的政权，利用布尔什维克党过去的威望和苏维埃国家的财富，支持修正主义的蜕化，在已经成为人民民主的东欧各国建立修正主义—资产阶级制度。苏联修正主义集团使用一切办法让资产阶级复辟路线占上风。它丑化社会主义成就和玩弄阴谋企图使全世界共产主义战士迷失方向，否定马克思列宁主义的普遍意义，散布和平道路和议会道路的骗人鬼话，赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上对斯大林的伟大革命者的形象进行攻击，（苏修集团）实行向别国施加政治、经济、军事压力和讹诈的大国沙文主义政策，越来越密切地勾结美帝国主义划分世界为势力范围以阻止各国人民革命斗争的发展。
      “修正主义集团在一系列国家里——那里的无产阶级曾致力于争取建设社会主义的阶级斗争——窃据了领导权，在一切领域中复辟了修正主义—资产阶级制度。经济已转变到资本主义基础上，形成了剥削者阶层；生活方式、习惯、文化都逐步带上资产阶级制度色彩；对外政策被纳入苏美联盟的范围。”
    公报揭露苏修叛徒集团借口什么“捍卫捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义，妄图掩盖它的赤裸裸侵略罪行”。公报说：“难道不正是苏共二十二大确定了全民国家——即在一个社会主义国家中不再有阶级和阶级斗争吗？这就表明（苏修领导集团）用这一理论来取消无产阶级专政。”
    公报说：“全民党的理论难道不正是在（苏共）二十二大确定的吗？这不就是要否定列宁和斯大林的党的正确性吗？这意味着取消布尔什维克党。所以应当从苏联的修正主义蜕化中去寻找捷克斯洛伐克修正主义蜕化的原因。”
    公报指出，以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团的所作所为，只能使修正主义国家内部和它们的关系的领域内重新产生资产阶级制度本身的典型矛盾。在捷克斯洛伐克的具体情况下，竞争集团自称都要保卫社会主义；实际上，这是修正主义—资产阶级共同路线范围内的竞争。
    公报接着强调说：“今天，保卫社会主义和共产主义事业、无产阶级国际主义宝库和马克思列宁主义的旗帜，是由以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导的、致力于无产阶级文化大革命的世界革命堡垒——人民中国高高举起；是由以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导的、正在推进思想和文化领域的革命发展和以巨大成就推进社会主义建设的欧洲社会主义明灯——阿尔巴尼亚高高举起；是由正在世界各地发展着的马克思列宁主义政党和组织高高举起。”
    公报说，目前，深刻的危机正在冲击着整个修正主义—帝国主义，这就为全世界马克思列宁主义者更有效地进行反对帝国主义、反对资产阶级、反对现代修正主义的斗争提供了新的可能性。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和其他修正主义者所统治的国家的工人阶级和人民，应当准备并展开反对现代修正主义的日益坚决的斗争，以便把所有修正主义集团一扫而光，重新建立无产阶级专政。“全世界马克思列宁主义党应当日益壮大自己的队伍，高举马克思列宁主义大旗，高举马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的大旗，高举当代马克思列宁主义最高创造性的体现——毛泽东思想的大旗前进。”
    公报说，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所推行的向美帝国主义者投降的路线，使劳动者对修正主义及其给革命运动带来的损害，有了日益深刻的认识。工人阶级、农民、革命青年是不会受骗的。我们党的全体党员和一切组织，已经动员起来，投入工作和斗争，以便日益密切联系群众，揭露意大利一切修正主义者的阴谋，击败反动派和帝国主义的一切阴谋活动，把最广泛的人民群众争取到光荣和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义事业方面来。
