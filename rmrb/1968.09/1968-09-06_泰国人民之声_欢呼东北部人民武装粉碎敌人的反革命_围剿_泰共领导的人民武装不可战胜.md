	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on September 4, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious victory of the Thai northeastern people's armed forces in their struggle to crush the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom military clique.

	The article said that from March to July this year, the U.S. imperialists and the Thai reactionaries mobilized fifteen battalions of reactionary military and police forces to launch a counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the northeastern people's armed forces in Thailand.

	The heroic northeastern people and their armed forces, with unshakable fighting spirit, employed the strategies and tactics of people's war as advocated by Chairman Mao Zedong, and smashed the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thai reactionaries. In the more than ten battles fought during this counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaign, the people's armed forces killed and wounded over 150 enemy troops, shot down two enemy aircraft, and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

	The article pointed out that people and armed forces across the country are jubilant over the victory of the northeastern people and their armed forces in their counter-"encirclement and suppression" struggle.

	The article said that this victory has set a brilliant example for the armed forces and people in various places, powerfully supporting the armed revolutionary struggle of the people throughout the country and accelerating the victorious development of the armed revolutionary struggle of the people throughout the country.

	The article emphasized that the victory of the northeastern people and their armed forces in their counter-"encirclement and suppression" struggle has demonstrated the invincible might of Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant thoughts on people's war.

	The article pointed out that this victory has shown the strength and invincibility of the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It has shown that this people's army possesses the spirit of fearlessness, daring to struggle, daring to win, and being undaunted by any hardships and sacrifices, and pressing forward with indomitable revolutionary spirit.

	The article said that the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom traitorous clique are unwilling to accept defeat and will continue to struggle desperately.

	Our revolutionary struggle will inevitably encounter some temporary difficulties. However, our future is bright. As long as the people of our country closely unite under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, persist in people's war, despise the enemy strategically, take the enemy seriously tactically, and heighten vigilance against the enemy, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.
