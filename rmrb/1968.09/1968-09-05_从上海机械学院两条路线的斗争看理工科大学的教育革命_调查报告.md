The editorial board of Red Flag Magazine notes: This is another investigative report from Shanghai. It is published here for reference. We hope that the revolutionary committees in all large, medium, and small industrial cities across the country will organize some people to conduct typical investigations on the situation of engineering and technical personnel in various factories under their jurisdiction, as well as the situation of the educational revolution in technical and vocational high schools and colleges. These reports should be submitted to the central authorities, and we will select key points for publication. Here, we raise a question: For the large number of graduates from high schools and colleges who have already been working or are currently working, attention should be paid to their re-education to integrate them with workers and peasants. Among them, there must be those who have integrated well and made inventions and innovations, and they should be reported to encourage them. For those who are truly incorrigible, that is, the die-hard capitalists and bourgeois technical authorities who are deeply hated by the people and need to be overthrown, they are only a small number. Even for these people, we must provide a way out. A policy that does not provide a way out is not a proletarian policy. The above policies should be applied to both old and new intellectuals in the liberal arts and sciences.

Selecting students from workers and peasants with practical experience is a good approach.
In the investigative report "From Shanghai Machine Tool Factory: The Path to Cultivating Engineering and Technical Personnel," the Shanghai Machine Manufacturing School was mentioned. It is the predecessor of the current Shanghai Mechanical College. It was established in 1952 and was directly under the Ministry of the First Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government. Later, it became a mechanical college through "standardization." From the changes in this school, there are many thought-provoking aspects.

When the school was established, to cultivate technical talents from the laboring people and meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, the first batch of 2,181 students were all selected from workers, peasants, and some grassroots cadres in rural areas. These worker-peasant students underwent the tempering of class struggles such as the "Three Antis," "Five Antis," and land reform, and had some production experience. These students selected from workers and peasants with practical experience had the following advantages:

First, the worker-peasant students had clear learning goals. They said: "Bourgeois intellectuals ridicule us, saying, 'Workers and peasants have low culture, don't know ABC, how can they learn design?' We must listen to Chairman Mao's words. The laboring people must become masters of science and culture." After entering the school, they proposed the battle slogans of "fighting for Chairman Mao's honor" and "not letting a single comrade fall behind." They voluntarily organized "mutual aid groups" and advocated "little teachers," with three people in a group, the capable ones teaching, and helping each other. For example, when teaching chemistry, many students had difficulty remembering the chemical symbols. Everyone composed a song about chemical elements, singing and reciting, and quickly memorized them.

Second, the worker-peasant students had high class consciousness and dared to despise bourgeois intellectuals and bourgeois academic "authorities." There was a "doctor" in the school who had studied in Germany and was worshipped as an idol by some teachers who believed in foreign doctrines. Once, this "doctor" brought a thick stack of books to teach electricity. He read from the book, severely detached from production reality. The worker-peasant students did not want to listen and asked this "doctor" two questions related to the production of electric motors, catching the "doctor" off guard. To maintain his face, he tried to use his incomprehensible "theory" to brush off the workers' questions. But the worker-peasant students did not buy it and continued to ask, resulting in the "doctor" stammering, "I haven't looked at technical magazines for over ten years!" Later, the worker-peasant students drove this "giant" off the podium.

Third, they challenged the old educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods. At that time, the educational system, teaching content, and methods were still old, and the educational power was basically controlled by a group of bourgeois intellectuals. However, because the number of worker-peasant students was large, accounting for more than 90% of the entire faculty and staff, the bourgeois intellectuals were surrounded by worker-peasant students. Therefore, the old educational system was continuously challenged. At that time, the school leadership established a class advisor system, attempting to control the worker-peasant students with this method. The worker-peasant students did not accept it, resulting in the class advisor system being virtually abolished. However, the most authoritative in the school were the student party and league branches and the student union organizations. Once, during the mid-term mathematics exam for the entire school, bourgeois intellectuals used the method of setting difficult and strange questions, causing nearly half of the more than 2,000 students to fail. The worker-peasant students were very angry and sent representatives from each class to the teaching office to reason and struggle, forcing the school to declare the exam invalid.

Fourth, they emphasized practical application. The worker-peasant students of this school went to a factory in Wuxi for production practice. As soon as they arrived at the factory, they put on oily work clothes and worked with the workers, discussing production technology issues. They quickly applied the theoretical knowledge they learned to production, helping the factory propose more than 120 technical innovation suggestions, of which more than 30 were immediately adopted by the factory. At the same time, a group of students from a certain university in Shanghai who participated in production practice in the same factory spent the whole day copying a large number of process operation procedures, creating nothing. The workers in the factory reflected: "Worker students learn and it is practical." After returning to their production units, they had many inventions and innovations. Comrade Wang Defa, who led the design of a large-scale flat grinding machine with international standards at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, was a graduate of this school; the worker technician who made the fourth major technological innovation to the hydraulic control box of the precision grinding machine at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory was also a graduate of this school; the person in charge of the trial production of China's first 200,000-times electron microscope was also a graduate of the worker-peasant class of this school.

However, selecting students from workers and peasants with practical experience and cultivating intellectuals of the working class hit the core of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Over the past decade, the struggle on the educational front between two classes, two lines, and two roads has been a life-and-death struggle.

In 1952, when the first batch of worker-peasant students entered the school, the Shanghai working class was jubilant. They said: "We workers not only want to stand up politically but also want to become masters of science and technology. We want to cultivate our own intellectuals of the working class." At that time, almost every worker who came to the school, the factory would hold a grand farewell ceremony, giving them big red flowers, as honorable as enlisting in the army.

However, a small group of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals in the school jumped out, shouting "terrible," "unthinkable," and spouting nonsense such as "worker-peasant students are stupid, their entrance levels are inconsistent, and it is difficult to cultivate them," "worker-peasant students like to give opinions and disrespect teachers," "cultivating worker-peasant students is not worth it," and so on. They used their educational power to vigorously promote the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev and impose bourgeois dictatorship on worker-peasant students.

These capitalist-roaders did everything they could to oppose and restrict workers and peasants from entering the school. This school only recruited worker-peasant students three times, in 1952, recruiting 2,181 people. A small group of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals regarded it as a "burden" and in a work summary in March 1955, they attacked and slandered the worker-peasant students in every way. Thus, they adopted the policy of "greatly shrinking," and that year, only 173 worker-peasant students were recruited. In 1960, under the pretext of "entering the school based on exam results, treating everyone equally," they actually closed the door to the children of workers and peasants and opened the door to the children of the bourgeoisie, recruiting only 17 worker-peasant students. From then on, it was as difficult for workers and peasants with practical experience to enter the school as climbing to the sky.

They deliberately made things difficult, suppressed, and persecuted worker-peasant students in teaching. For example, in the drawing course, which should be easy for mechanical workers to master, these bourgeois gentlemen insisted that worker-peasant students first learn descriptive geometry, using mysterious intersecting bodies and intersecting lines to make things difficult for worker-peasant students. In an exam in 1957, more than 40 out of 170 worker-peasant students were held back. A labor model from Hunan, a fifth-level technician, was given 59 points by the bourgeois gentlemen, who used a "one-point difference" to make him repeat the grade. The worker-peasant students said: "The passing line, the passing line, is a blockade line for workers and peasants, a line for the restoration of capitalism." In 1960, 14 out of the 17 students who entered the school were forced to drop out due to the persecution of the bourgeois examination system, and they left the school with deep hatred for the revisionist educational system. A outstanding worker from the Shanghai Printing Factory No. 3, who had been in the school for only a year and a half, was held back because he failed in physical education, foreign language, and physics, and was later forced to drop out. He had raised his opinions on the promotion and retention system to the school leadership, but the school's capitalist-roaders said viciously: "The promotion and retention system is the same for everyone, and worker-peasant students cannot be an exception." However, another young student from a bourgeois family, who failed in five subjects, was promoted by the school's capitalist-roaders using various means.

In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school launched a fierce attack on the revisionist educational line. The school saw the emergence of many revolutionary new things, such as workers going to the podium, workers, teachers, and students working together to teach, and the school running a factory. On November 12, Comrade Kang Sheng came to the school for an inspection. He emphasized that workers should go to the podium. The real force that can be relied on in the school is them; the real capable ones are them. Some university graduates only know how to talk but not how to do. Comrade Ke Qingshi also made important instructions on cultivating technical personnel from workers in that year and instructed that a batch of people be selected from workers to engage in cutting-edge scientific research. These instructions greatly boosted the morale of the worker-peasant students. However, in the midst of the high tide of the educational revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in Shanghai, Chen Pixin, came to this school and gave a black directive, supporting the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals in the school, and encouraging them to dare not execute the important directives of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They did not allow workers to go to the podium and still let bourgeois intellectuals monopolize the power. They fiercely resisted Comrade Ke Qingshi's instructions, opposed the selection of politically and professionally excellent worker-peasant students to engage in scientific research, and forcibly recalled 10 out of the 30 students who had been selected. The 21 worker students who graduated and stayed in the school in 1959 were all party members, but only one became a teacher, and the vast majority went to the attached factory to work as workers. Party member Li Fuxing, who was a fifth-level technician before entering the school, was assigned to the technical experiment room as an auxiliary after four years of study, not even qualified to be an experimentalist, let alone teaching work.

At the same time, they marginalized worker-peasant cadres. In 1956, 44 worker-peasant graduates who stayed in the school were mostly party members, but 29 of them were later marginalized. The capitalist-roaders pointed at the worker-peasant cadres who served as political instructors after graduation and said: "You who graduated from a technical school are not good enough, only university graduates can be political instructors."

In terms of the educational system, they also copied the revisionist system of the Soviet Union, attempting to push worker-peasant students into the revisionist quagmire. Starting in 1954, they invited many foreign experts and fully learned the revisionist system of the Soviet Union. They followed the black directive of the Chinese Khrushchev to "bring it all over and say it later," and copied the Soviet revisionist system in terms of professional settings, training objectives, teaching plans, teaching outlines, teaching materials, teaching methods, teaching organizations, and regulations. Everything from the "six links," "seven plans," "twenty-four forms," "promotion and retention system," and so on. The most typical was the physical education class. After learning from the Soviet Union, they jumped to ballroom dancing, forcibly pushing worker-peasant students onto the revisionist road.

At the same time, they followed the instructions of their black master, Lu Dingyi, and proposed to "learn from Jiaotong University, catch up with Harbin Institute of Technology," learning the so-called "school traditions" of capitalism and revisionism, emphasizing "high, precise, and advanced," "big, comprehensive, and advanced," and cultivating students into bourgeois engineers and designers who are "three separations." These guys, under the banner of "seeking big, seeking comprehensive, seeking new," made the organizational structure bloated, bureaucratic, and official. The number of students was still more than 2,000, but the number of departments increased from two departments and two offices in 1952 to seven departments, two offices, and 22 teaching and research offices in 1960; the number of faculty and staff increased from the original 300-plus to more than 800; the value of teaching equipment increased from 10 million yuan to more than 80 million yuan; the attached factory of the school, which served teaching and industrial production in the 1958 educational revolution, later engaged in capitalist operations, with profits as the guiding principle, becoming a money tree for the capitalist-roaders to squander and waste.

How to follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory
The fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in Shanghai Mechanical College since its establishment is a struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the proletariat's counter-restoration. The core issue of the struggle is the issue of power.

Recently, some engineering and technical personnel who graduated from this school in Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, as well as workers from the attached factory of this school and revolutionary teachers and students, after summing up the positive and negative experiences since the school's establishment, have put forward some views and ideas on the educational revolution in technical universities:

First, Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Universities should still be run, and I am mainly talking about technical universities. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice," points out the fundamental direction for the proletarian educational revolution in technical universities. They believe that technical universities should follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and the key is to solve the issue of which class holds the leadership. First, it is the issue of "power" in politics and organization. Chairman Mao sent the working class into universities to occupy the educational front, which is the key to ensuring that the leadership of the school is always in the hands of the working class and to ensure that workers and peasants with practical experience can continuously enter universities. Why did Shanghai Mechanical College, which once recruited students from workers and peasants with practical experience, later close its doors to workers and peasants? It is because the issue of "power" was not solved. This lesson must be learned. Secondly, it is the issue of "power" in ideology. Without using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the educational front, bourgeois ideology will inevitably spread. The long-term lesson of a small group of capitalist-roaders in the Shanghai Mechanical College Party imposing bourgeois dictatorship on worker-peasant students shows that it is necessary to deeply carry out a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist educational line, criticize the crimes of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school, criticize the anti-proletarian ideology of despising workers and peasants and despising practice, and criticize bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth. Mao Zedong Thought must be established in the school. Otherwise, the educational front will be lost again.

Second, the system of technical universities should be two to three years. The curriculum setting should break the boundaries between basic courses, technical foundation courses, and professional courses, and can use typical machines and typical parts in actual production as teaching materials, organically combining the three. Completely abolish the hollow theories and tedious philosophies that are detached from production practice. The teaching content should follow the principle of "less but better," grasp the essence, and master it thoroughly. Extensively carry out on-site teaching, combining education with productive labor. The reformed technical universities are not only schools but also factories and scientific research units. Students should enter the school with various difficulties encountered in production practice, and production departments and scientific research units should also, from the perspective of education, propose topics to the school in a planned and purposeful manner, so that students can focus on improving their problem-solving abilities in the process of production, learning, and research, achieving the goal of serving production and labor with education.

Third, technical universities should also undertake the task of running good part-time technical education, with the policy of factory-school cooperation and factory assistance. This is another important way to adhere to the mass line and cultivate a large number of engineering and technical personnel of the working class. Based on the needs of the proletarian industrial revolution, starting from production practice, the principle of "what is needed is taught, what is done is learned, what is lacking is supplemented" should be adopted to extensively run various forms of part-time technical schools and short-term training classes.

Fourth, build a proletarian teaching team. They believe that the current teaching team cannot undertake the task of educating worker-peasant students with practical experience and must be rectified, transformed, and rebuilt. In the future, the teaching team should adopt the form of combining workers with high proletarian political awareness and practical experience, worker-peasant students with practical experience, and revolutionary intellectuals. A large number of workers and technicians in society who have made inventions and innovations in practice should be planned to regularly enter the school to teach. This batch of workers undertaking educational tasks can be full-time or part-time, but most of them are part-time. The main role of full-time teachers should be reflected in organizing the organic combination of schools, factories, and scientific research departments, helping students to elevate practice to theory and return to practice. Students also have practical experience and can go to the podium and exchange with each other. Existing teachers should be sent to workers and peasants in batches to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

    从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命
    ——调查报告
    红旗杂志编者按：这是上海市的又一个调查报告，现发表，供参考。全国各大、中、小工业城市所属各工厂的工程技术干部情况如何，各理工科高等、中等学校教育革命的情况如何，希望各地革命委员会组织一些人做些典型的调查，报告中央，本刊将择要予以发表。这里提出一个问题，就是对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。其中必有结合得好的并有所发明创造的，应予以报导，以资鼓励。实在不行的，即所谓顽固不化的走资派及资产阶级技术权威，民愤很大需要打倒的，只是极少数。就是对于这些人，也要给出路，不给出路的政策，不是无产阶级的政策。上述各项政策，无论对于文科、理科新旧知识分子，都应是如此。
    从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生就是好
    在《从上海机床厂看培养工程技术人员的道路》那篇调查报告中，曾经提到上海机器制造学校。它是现在上海机械学院的前身。它创办于一九五二年，直属中央人民政府第一机械工业部。后来，搞“正规化”，变成机械学院。从这个学校的变化过程中，有许多发人深省的东西。
    学校创办的时候，为了从劳动人民中培养技术人才，适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，第一届招收的二千一百八十一个学生，全是从工人农民和一部分农村基层干部中选拔的。这批工农学生经受了“三反”、“五反”和土改等阶级斗争的锻炼，又有一定的生产实践经验。这批从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔的学生有如下几方面的优点：
    第一，工农学生的学习目的性明确。他们说：“资产阶级知识分子骂我们，‘工农文化低，不懂ABC，那能学设计’，我们要听毛主席的话，劳动人民要成为科学文化的主人。”他们进校后提出了“要为毛主席争气”，“不让一个阶级兄弟掉队”的战斗口号，自觉地组织“互助组”，提倡“小先生”，三人一组，能者为师，互相帮助，互相学习。比如教化学，许多学生记不住元素符号，大家编起了化学元素歌，又唱又背，很快就记牢了。
    第二，工农学生阶级觉悟高，敢于藐视资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级学术“权威”。学校里有一个留德的电学“博士”，曾被一些迷信洋教条的教师当作偶像来崇拜。一次这位“博士”带了厚厚一叠书来教电学，他照本宣科，严重脱离生产实际，工农学生不要听，就向这位“博士先生”提出了两个有关电动机的生产实际问题，将了“博士先生”一军。他为了维护自己的面子，就用那套别人听不懂的“理论”企图把工人提出的问题搪塞过去。但工农学生不买他的账，继续追问，结果这位“博士先生”只得吞吞吐吐地说：“我已经有十多年没有看技术杂志了！”后来，工农学生把这个“庞然大物”轰下了讲台。
    第三，冲击了旧的教育制度、教学内容和教学方法。当时教育制度、教学内容及方法还是旧的，教育大权基本上被一批资产阶级知识分子操纵着。但是，由于当时工农学生数量多，占全院师生员工百分之九十以上，资产阶级知识分子处于工农学生包围之中，所以旧的一套教育制度还是受到了不断冲击。当时，学校领导设立了班主任制度，企图用这一套把工农学生管起来。工农学生不吃那一套，结果班主任制度等于虚设。而在学校中最有威信的却是学生党团支部和学生会组织。一次全校数学期中考试，资产阶级知识分子采用出难题怪题的办法，使全校二千多学生有近半数不及格，工农学生很气愤，各班级都派代表到教导处去说理斗争，迫使校方宣布这次考试作废。
    第四，学以致用。这个学校的工农学生到无锡某工厂进行生产实习，一到工厂就穿起油腻的工作服和工人一起劳动，讨论生产技术问题，很快就把学到的理论知识运用到生产上去，帮助该厂提出了一百二十多项技术革新建议，其中立即被工厂采纳的就有三十多项。而同时在该厂参加生产实习的上海某大学的一批学生，却整天拿着本本到处抄录一大堆工艺操作规程，无所创造。该厂的工人反映：“工人学生学了就是顶用。”他们回到生产单位后还有许多创造发明。上海机床厂主持设计具有国际水平的大型平面磨床的王德法同志就是该校的毕业生；在上海机床厂对精密磨床的液压操纵箱进行了第四次重大技术革新的工人技师，也是这个学校的毕业生；负责试制我国第一台二十万倍电子显微镜工作的，也是该校工农班的毕业生。
    一场两条路线的尖锐斗争
    但是，从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，培养工人阶级的知识分子，击中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的要害。十多年来，围绕着如何对待工农学生的问题，在教育阵地上展开了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗。
    一九五二年，当第一批工农学生进校时，上海工人阶级一片欢腾。他们说：“我们工人阶级不但要在政治上翻身，而且要成为科学技术的主人，我们要培养工人阶级自己的知识分子。”当时，几乎每一个工人到学校来，工厂都要敲锣打鼓开欢送会，给他们戴了大红花，象参军一样光荣。
    可是，学校里一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子跳了出来，狂叫“糟得很”，“这样做不可思议”，大放厥词，说什么“工农学生脑子笨，入学程度又不一致，难以培养”、“工农学生好提意见，对师长不尊敬”、“培养工农学生得不偿失”，等等。他们利用手中的教育大权，猖狂地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，对工农学生实行资产阶级专政。
    这些走资派千方百计反对和限制工人、农民入学。这个学校一共只有三次招收工农学生，一九五二年招收了二千一百八十一人。一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子把它当成“包袱”，在一九五五年三月的一份工作总结中，百般攻击和诬蔑工农学生。于是采取了“大大收缩”的方针，这一年工农学生只招了一百七十三名。一九六○年，在“以考试成绩入学，一视同仁”的幌子下，实际上对工农子女关门、为资产阶级子女开门，仅招收了十七名工农学生。从此，有实践经验的工人农民要想入学比登天还难。
    他们在教学上故意刁难、打击、迫害工农学生。例如制图课，这对于机械工人来说应该是容易掌握的。可是这班资产阶级老爷们硬要工农学生先学习投影几何，用玄妙的相贯体、相贯线来刁难工农学生，在一九五七年的一次考试中，使一百七十多位工农学生有四十多位留了级。有一位来自湖南的劳动模范、五级技工的学生，资产阶级老爷们费尽了心机，给他批了五十九分，硬是以“一分之差”要他留级。工农学生说：“分数线，分数线，是对工农的封锁线，是资本主义的复辟线。”一九六○年入学的十七名学生，受资产阶级的考试制度的迫害，先后有十四名学生被迫退学，他们怀着对修正主义教育制度的深仇大恨，愤然离校。市印三厂一位优秀工人，入学才一年半，因为体育、外文、物理三门课不及格留了级，后来又被迫退了学。他曾向学校领导提出对升留级制度的意见，可是学校的走资派恶狠狠地说：“升留级制度对任何人一视同仁，工农学生不能例外。”但是，另一个资产阶级家庭出身的青年学生，有五门课不及格，学校走资派却用种种手法准其升级。
    一九五八年，在毛主席教育革命思想的光辉照耀下，这个学校的革命师生向修正主义教育路线发起了猛烈的冲击，学校里出现了许多革命的新事物，如工人上讲台，工人、教师、学生三结合搞教学，学校办工厂等。十一月十二日，康生同志来校视察。他强调指出，工人要上讲台。学校里真正可以依靠的力量，是他们；真正有本事的，是他们。有些大学毕业生，只会动口，不会动手。柯庆施同志在这一年对从工人中培养技术人才也作过重要指示，并指示从工人中抽一批人去搞尖端的科学研究。这些指示，都大长了工农学生的志气。但是，就在轰轰烈烈的教育革命高潮中，中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人陈丕显到这个学校大发黑指示，为校内的走资派和资产阶级知识分子张目，鼓励他们胆敢拒不执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的重要指示。他们不让工人上讲台，仍然让资产阶级知识分子专我们的政。他们疯狂地对抗柯庆施同志的指示，反对抽调政治业务兼优的工农学生去搞科学研究，从已调去的三十名学生中，强行调回了十名。一九五九年毕业留校的二十一名工人学生，都是党团员，而只有一名当教师，绝大多数到附属工厂当工人。党员学生李复兴入学前已是五级技工，学了四年却分配在工艺实验室当辅助人员，连当实验员都没资格，更谈不上教学工作了。
    同时，他们排挤工农干部。一九五六年留校的四十四个工农毕业生，大部分是党员，后来被排挤出去的竟有二十九个，走资派指着毕业后在校当政治指导员的工农干部说：“你们中专毕业的不行啊，大学生指导员要大学毕业的才行。”
    在教育制度方面，他们还照搬苏联修正主义那一套，妄图将工农学生推入修正主义泥坑。从一九五四年起，他们请来了不少外国专家，全面学苏联修正主义那一套。他们根据中国赫鲁晓夫“把它统统搬过来再说”的黑指示，从专业设置、培养目标、教学计划、教学大纲、教材、教学方法、教学组织、规章制度，统统照搬苏修那一套，什么“六个环节”，“七种计划”，“二十四种表格”，“升留级制度”等等。最典型的是体育课，学苏联后，大跳其交谊舞，硬把工农学生往修正主义道路上拉。
    同时，他们紧跟黑主子陆定一的旨意，提出“学交大，赶哈工大”，学习资本主义、修正主义的所谓“办学传统”，强调“高精尖”、“大洋全”，把学生培养成为“三脱离”的资产阶级工程师和设计师。这些家伙又以“求大、求全、求新”为名，把机构体制搞得庞大、臃肿、官僚化。学生同样是二千多，机构从一九五二年只有二处二室到一九六○年增加到七个部、处，二个室，二十二个教研室；教职员工从原来三百多人，猛增到八百多人；教学设备从价值一百万元骤增到八百多万元；学校的附属工厂，在一九五八年教育革命中，是为教学、为工农业生产服务，以后大搞资本主义经营，利润挂帅，成为走资派挥霍浪费的摇钱树。
    怎样走上海机床厂的道路
    上海机械学院建校以来的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争是一场资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的斗争。斗争的中心问题是政权问题。
    最近，部分当年从这个学校毕业的上海机床厂工程技术人员以及这个学校附属工厂的工人同志和广大革命师生，在总结了建校以来的正反面经验以后，对理工科大学的教育革命提出了一些看法和设想：
    一、毛主席最新指示“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”，为理工科大学实行无产阶级教育革命指出了根本方向。他们认为，理工科大学要走上海机床厂的道路，必须解决由那个阶级掌握领导权的问题。首先，是政治上组织上的“权”。毛主席派工人阶级进大学，占领教育阵地，这是保证学校领导大权永远掌握在工人阶级手里的关键，是保证有实践经验的工人农民不断进入大学的关键。上海机械学院曾经从有实践经验的工人农民中招收学生，后来为什么向工农关门？就是因为没有解决“权”的问题。这个教训必须吸取。其次，是思想上的“权”。不用毛泽东思想占领教育阵地，资产阶级思想势必会泛滥。上海机械学院党内一小撮走资派长期以来对工农学生实行资产阶级专政的教训说明，必须深入开展对修正主义教育路线的革命大批判，批判资产阶级知识分子统治学校的罪行，批判轻视工农、轻视实践的反无产阶级思想，批判资产阶级名利思想。要确立毛泽东思想在学校的统治地位。否则，教育阵地会得而复失。
    二、理工科大学的学制以二至三年为宜。课程设置要打破过去基础课、技术基础课与专业课的界限，可以采用实际生产中的典型机械、典型零件作教材，把三者有机地结合起来。彻底废除脱离生产实践的空洞理论和烦琐哲学。教学内容贯彻少而精的原则，抓住精华，学得精通。广泛开展现场教学，使教育与生产劳动相结合。改革后的理工科大学，既是一个学校，又是一个工厂，也是一个科研单位。学生应当带着生产实践中碰到的各种难题进入学校，生产部门和科研单位也要从教育的角度出发，有计划有目的地向学校提出课题，使学生在边生产、边学习、边研究中着重提高分析问题和解决问题的能力，做到教育为生产劳动服务。
    三、理工科大学还要担负起办好业余技术教育的任务，方针是厂校合作，厂办校助。这是坚持群众路线，大量培养工人阶级工程技术队伍的另一个重要途径。根据无产阶级工业革命的需要，从生产实际出发，采取“要什么办什么，做什么学什么，缺什么补什么”的教学原则，大量地办好各种形式的业余技术学校和短期训练班。
    四、建立一支无产阶级的教师队伍。他们认为，现有的教师队伍不能担当起教育有实践经验的工农学生的任务，必须加以整顿、改造、重建。今后的教师队伍应当采取有高度无产阶级政治觉悟的、有实践经验的工人，有实践经验的工农学生和革命知识分子三结合的形式。社会上一大批在实践中有发明创造的工人，技术人员，要有计划地定期地深入学校讲课。这一批担任教育任务的工人可以是专职的，也可以是兼职的，但绝大部分是兼职的。专职教师的主要作用应当体现在组织学校和工厂、科研部门的有机结合上，帮助学生把实践上升为理论，再回到实践中去。学生们也都有实践经验，可以走上讲台、互相交流。现有的教师应该分期分批地到工农中去，走与工农相结合的道路。
