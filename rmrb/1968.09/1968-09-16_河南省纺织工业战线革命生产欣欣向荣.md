The textile industry in Henan Province is flourishing with revolutionary production. The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the textile industry system of Henan Province, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are vigorously promoting revolution and vigorously promoting production. The entire textile industry front in the province presents a thriving and prosperous situation.

Since this year, the total output value of the textile industry in Henan Province has been rising month by month, and the output has been increasing month by month. The quality has also been continuously improving. Among them, the cotton yarn output in July increased by 21 percent compared to June, and the output in August increased by 6.3 percent compared to July; the cotton cloth output in July increased by 22 percent compared to June, and the output in August increased by 6.28 percent compared to July.

The significant increase in textile production in Henan is the result of the broad masses of revolutionary workers holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Since this year, various factories, workshops, and teams have continuously held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, frequently holding lectures on the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, exchanging advanced experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and bring about a new leap in production. Since this year, Zhengzhou National Cotton Mill No. 6 has held more than a hundred study classes of various types on Mao Zedong Thought, held more than thirty large-scale lectures on the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and more than a hundred small-scale lectures. Through these studies, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have further raised their political awareness, tempered their hearts of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and vigorously promoted the thought revolution of the people.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable rules and regulations, transfer office staff to the production front, and the struggle, criticism, and reform in factories generally go through these stages." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad masses of textile workers in the province have quickly launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform. The revolutionary workers in various factories, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have further launched a revolutionary great criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of management advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents. With the deepening of the revolutionary great criticism and the cleaning up of the class ranks, the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been further raised, a handful of hidden class enemies have been exposed, and the class ranks have been purified. Many factory revolutionary committees, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction that "revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organizations, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses," have seriously implemented the streamlining and reduction of personnel. Many factories have streamlined overlapping administrative organizations and transferred a large number of office staff to the production front line to carry out the revolution and promote production together with the workers.

    河南省纺织工业战线革命生产欣欣向荣
    河南省纺织工业系统广大革命工人，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全省纺织工业战线呈现一派欣欣向荣的大好形势。
    今年以来，河南省纺织工业的总产值月月上升，产量逐月增长，质量也不断提高。其中七月份棉纱产量比六月份增长百分之二十一，八月份又比七月份增长百分之六点三；棉布产量七月份比六月份增长百分之二十二，八月份又比七月份增长百分之六点二八。
    河南纺织工业生产大幅度上升，是广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的结果。今年以来，各工厂、车间和班组都持续不断地举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，经常召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，交流学习毛主席著作的先进经验，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，使生产出现了崭新的跃进局面。郑州国棉六厂今年以来已经举办了上百期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，召开了三十多次大型活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，一百多次小型讲用会。通过学习，广大革命职工进一步提高了政治觉悟，锤炼了无限忠于毛主席的红心，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”全省广大纺织工人在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，迅速掀起斗、批、改的高潮。各工厂广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，进一步对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线展开了革命大批判。随着革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的深入开展，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，揪出了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，纯洁了阶级队伍。很多工厂的革命委员会，遵照毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，认真实行精兵简政。许多工厂精简了重叠的行政机构，下放大批科室人员深入生产第一线，同工人一起抓革命，促生产。
