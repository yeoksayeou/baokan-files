The reactionary government of Sato recently sent a "special envoy" to the United States to engage in activities, openly joining forces with the U.S. imperialists to clamor for the extension of the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty and to hatch new anti-China plots.

New China News Agency, September 13th: Tokyo - The reactionary government of Sato in Japan, in order to further strengthen its counterrevolutionary collusion with U.S. imperialism, recently dispatched Fukushima Masatoshi, the vice-chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, as a "special envoy" of Prime Minister Sato Eisaku to the United States.

Fukushima had frequent contacts with the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S. government and held "talks" with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Fukushima handed over a "personal letter" from Sato to Johnson to Rusk.

According to reports, Rusk and Fukushima discussed the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty, the Okinawa issue, the China issue, and the Vietnam issue during their "talks." The report said that Rusk and Fukushima, in their "talks," shamelessly plotted, despite strong opposition from the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia, to continue the aggressive military alliance treaty—the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty—aimed at socialist China and other peoples of Asia after 1970. Rusk told Fukushima that even by 1970, the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty should not be "changed in any way," that is, it should be "automatically extended." Fukushima expressed that the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party also "tend to automatically extend" the treaty. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Tokyo Shimbun" reported that the U.S. and Japan reached "complete" agreement on the "automatic extension" of the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty.

On the Okinawa issue, the Sato government in Japan will continue to provide Okinawa to U.S. imperialism as a military base for invading Vietnam and other countries in Asia. According to reports, during the "talks," Rusk told Fukushima that the U.S. government's attitude towards the Okinawa issue "has not changed," and the U.S. "cannot make a promise to return (Okinawa) soon." This fully exposed the U.S. imperialists' wolfish ambition to permanently occupy Okinawa. According to a report by the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" on the 10th, after holding "talks" with Rusk, Fukushima told the press that "on the issue of continuing to use Okinawa as a (military) base, both sides reached an agreement."

Rusk and Fukushima also jointly plotted new conspiracies against China during this "talk." Fukushima's activities in the U.S. were conducted at a time when the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of the world was further escalating, and the struggle of the Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan "security" treaty and to remove all U.S. military bases in Japan was reaching a new high. The deal Fukushima made with his master in the U.S. further exposed the reactionary face of the Sato government, which is determined to follow the U.S. imperialists in opposing China and the peoples of Asia, and is willing to act as a henchman and running dog of the U.S. imperialists.

The Sato reactionary government will inevitably face stronger opposition from the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia as a result.

    美日反动派反革命勾结越来越紧
    佐藤反动政府最近派“特使”去美国活动，公然同美帝一起叫嚷要延长日美“安全”条约，并策划反华新阴谋
    新华社十三日讯　东京消息：日本佐藤反动政府为了进一步加强与美帝国主义的反革命勾结，最近派遣自由民主党副总裁川岛正次郎作为日本首相佐藤荣作的“特使”，到美国活动。
    川岛同美国政府以及民主、共和两党的头目们进行了频繁的接触，并且同美国国务卿腊斯克举行了“会谈”。川岛把佐藤荣作写给约翰逊的一封“亲笔信”，交给了腊斯克。
    据报道，腊斯克和川岛在“会谈”时着重地讨论了日美“安全”条约问题、冲绳问题、中国问题和越南问题。报道说，腊斯克和川岛在“会谈”中，竟然不顾日本人民和亚洲人民的强烈反对，丧心病狂地策划在一九七○年后，继续保持把矛头指向社会主义中国和其他亚洲国家人民的侵略性军事同盟条约——日美“安全”条约。腊斯克对川岛说，即使到了一九七○年，日美“安全”条约也不要做“任何变更”，即“以实现自动延长为宜”。川岛表示，日本政府和自由民主党也“倾向于自动延长”。日本资产阶级报纸《东京新闻》报道说，日美双方在“自动延长”日美“安全”条约这一点上，“完全”取得了“一致意见”。
    在冲绳问题上，日本佐藤政府将继续把冲绳提供给美帝国主义作为侵略越南及亚洲其他国家的军事基地。据报道，“会谈”中，腊斯克对川岛说，美国政府对于冲绳问题的态度“没有变化”，美国“不能做出尽早归还（冲绳）的诺言”。这就充分暴露了美帝国主义企图永远霸占冲绳的狼子野心。据日本资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》十日报道，川岛在同腊斯克举行“会谈”后，向报界发表谈话时说，“在认为有必要继续把冲绳作为（军事）基地这一点上，（日美）双方取得了一致意见”。
    腊斯克和川岛在这次“会谈”中还共同策划了反对中国的新阴谋。川岛这次到美国活动，是在全世界人民反美斗争进一步高涨，日本人民要求废除日美“安全”条约，要求撤除美国在日本的一切军事基地的斗争出现新高潮的时候进行的。川岛在美国同他的主子做成的交易，进一步暴露了佐藤反动政府死心踏地追随美帝反对中国，反对亚洲人民，甘心充当美帝帮凶和走狗的反革命面目。
    佐藤反动政府必将因此遭到日本人民和亚洲人民越来越强烈的反对。
