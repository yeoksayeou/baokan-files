Pakistan Holds Parades and Other Activities to Solemnly Commemorate the Third Anniversary of Victory Against Indian Armed Invasion

President Ayub Khan Says Indira Gandhi's "No-War Pact" Proposal is a Trick

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, September 6th: Pakistan held grand commemorations across the country on the 6th to mark the third anniversary of the victory against the Indian armed invasion.

Pakistan President Ayub Khan issued a national address on the 6th, stating: "The danger that surfaced three years ago still exists. The Indian rulers, disregarding the sufferings of their own people, are striving to build a powerful war machine. If we ignore this threat, we are taking a risk ourselves."

President Ayub Khan said: "We have no other choice but to be prepared, stay vigilant, and build an effective deterrent force. We are doing this." He said: "Our armed forces are now fully equipped and ready to confront any threat to our security."

Pakistan's Defense Minister Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan delivered a radio address on the 6th. He pointed out that during the 1965 war against the Indian armed invasion, the Pakistani armed forces fought against an enemy five times their number, inflicting a humiliating defeat on them. The people showed bravery and a spirit of self-sacrifice, enthusiastically supporting the armed forces, and this has written a glorious chapter in Pakistan's history. India is spreading lies about "Chinese aggression," obtaining weapons from the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. India, blinded by its ambitions, is engaged in aggressive activities, threatening Pakistan's security.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Abdul Hamid Khan delivered a speech. He said that the people of Kashmir are fighting against Indian tyranny and will continue until they achieve final victory.

On the 6th, parades and other commemorative activities were held in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi, Dhaka, and other major cities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, September 4th: Pakistan President Ayub Khan delivered a national radio address on the 1st in Rawalpindi, saying that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's proposal to sign a "no-war pact" with Pakistan is an attempt to deceive and mislead the world. President Ayub Khan said that Pakistan has always advocated for peace. He then pointed out: "Discussing a 'no-war pact' without resolving the Kashmir dispute is merely an attempt to deceive and mislead the world."

President Ayub Khan, when talking about Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's recent visit to China, said that the Chinese leaders, during their talks with Bhutto, "reaffirmed that the relationship between China and Pakistan is a sincere, brotherly one, and this relationship will continue. I am pleased that cooperation between Pakistan and China is increasing, and in many aspects, our relationship is continuously developing."

    巴基斯坦各地举行阅兵和其它活动   
    隆重纪念胜利抗击印度武装侵略三周年
    阿尤布总统指出英迪拉·甘地的“非战公约”建议是骗局
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第六日电　巴基斯坦全国各地六日隆重纪念胜利抗击印度武装侵略三周年。
    巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗六日发表告全国书说：“三年前露头的危险现在仍然存在。印度统治者不顾本国人民疾苦，正在竭力建造一个强大的战争机器。我们如果忽视这一威胁，就等于自己去冒风险。”
    阿尤布总统说：“我们没有别的选择，只有作好准备，保持警惕，并且建立一支有效的遏制力量。我们正在这样做。”他说：“我们的武装部队今天已经充分装备起来，准备对付任何危及我们的安全的威胁。”
    巴基斯坦国防部长阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗六日发表广播演说。他指出，在一九六五年反抗印度武装侵略的战争中，巴基斯坦武装部队抗击了人数比自己多五倍的敌人，使他们遭受可耻的失败。民众显示了勇敢和不怕牺牲的精神，热烈支援武装部队，这为巴基斯坦历史写下了可贵的篇章。印度正在大肆散布所谓“中国侵略”的谎言，从美国、苏联等国取得武器。印度执迷不悟地从事侵略活动，威胁着巴基斯坦的安全。
    查谟和克什米尔自由政府主席阿卜杜勒·哈米德汗发表演说。他说，克什米尔人民正为反对印度的暴虐统治而奋斗，直到获得最后胜利。
    六日，拉瓦尔品第、拉合尔、卡拉奇、达卡和其它大城市都举行阅兵和其它纪念活动。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第四日电　巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗一日在拉瓦尔品第对全国广播讲话中说，印度总理英迪拉·甘地提出的与巴基斯坦签订一个“非战公约”的建议，是企图迷惑和欺骗世界。阿尤布总统说，巴基斯坦一贯主张和平。他接着指出：“不解决克什米尔争端而谈论‘非战公约’，不过是企图迷惑和欺骗世界罢了。”
    阿尤布总统在谈到巴基斯坦外交部长侯赛因最近对中国的访问时说，中国领导人在同侯赛因的会谈中，“重申了中国和巴基斯坦之间的关系是真诚的兄弟般的关系，并将继续保持这种关系。我感到高兴的是，巴基斯坦和中国之间的合作正在增加，在许多方面，我们之间的关系正在不断地发展。”
