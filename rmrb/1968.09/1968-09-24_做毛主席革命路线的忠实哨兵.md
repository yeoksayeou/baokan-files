After the joyous news of the entire nation turning red spread, teams of messengers arrived at the gates of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Among them was a Mongolian herdsman from the grasslands, dressed in traditional attire. He carefully observed every blade of grass and tree in front of the gates, finding everything so fresh and new. The sentinel thought he was looking for someone and quickly approached him. It turned out that he had rushed from the guesthouse upon hearing the great news of the entire nation turning red. The joyous scene captivated him. He was deeply moved and said, "The entire nation turning red is a severe blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The best singers and most beautiful songs of the grasslands cannot fully express the love and admiration of us impoverished herdsmen for Chairman Mao!"

In the midst of celebrating the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, touching scenes inspired the sentry soldiers. A revolutionary cadre from Xinjiang, while on a train to Beijing, heard that revolutionary committees had been established in Tibet and Xinjiang. He wished he could fly to Beijing immediately to celebrate this great day with the people of the capital. The train arrived the next day, but he forgot his travel fatigue and rushed to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. He recounted his journey to the soldier on duty at the gates: "I have been away for a month and nine days and am not very familiar with the recent situation in Xinjiang. The establishment of revolutionary committees in Tibet and Xinjiang made me see the great situation of the Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang and across the nation." He then made a request: "Soldier, please let me stand here for a while." After the soldier on duty granted his request, he joyfully and excitedly said, "Standing here, I can see the Xinjiang Revolutionary Committee. Soldiers, although Xinjiang and Beijing are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are forever united. Our goal is to defend Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line."

The sentry soldiers turned the hopes of the people into a great driving force, remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the rights the people have won must not be allowed to be lost easily and must be defended by struggle." They are determined to stand guard and keep watch for the revolutionary committee, to be loyal sentinels of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to defend the revolutionary committee and consolidate the great victory of the Cultural Revolution with unyielding struggle.

    做毛主席革命路线的忠实哨兵
    全国山河一片红的喜讯传开以后，一支支报喜的队伍来到北京市革命委员会门前。一位穿着民族服装的内蒙古草原的牧民也来了，他细心地观察着门前的一草一木，一切都是那样的新鲜，哨兵以为他是来找人的，忙着迎了过去。原来他是听到全国山河一片红的特大喜讯后从招待所赶来的。这欢乐的场面把他吸引住了。他很感动地说：全国山河一片红是给帝、修、反一个极沉重的打击，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。草原上最好的歌手、最美好的赞歌也表达不尽我们贫苦牧民对毛主席的热爱和敬仰啊！
    在欢呼无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的凯歌声中，一幕幕动人的事激励着警卫战士。一位新疆的革命干部在来京的火车上，听到西藏、新疆成立了革命委员会，恨不得一下子飞到北京，和首都人民一起共庆这个伟大的节日。列车第二天到站了，他忘了旅行的疲劳，马上来到北京市革命委员会，向正在革命委员会门前值勤的战士叙述了他的来历：我已经出门一个月零九天了，对新疆近来的情况不大了解，西藏、新疆革命委员会的成立，使我看到了新疆、也看到了全国文化大革命的大好形势。然后他提出要求：解放军同志，请你让我在这儿站一会。当值勤战士满足了他的要求后，他欣喜若狂，万分激动地说：我站在这里就看到了新疆革命委员会。解放军同志，虽然新疆和北京相隔千山万水，但我们的心是永远连在一起的，我们的目标都是为着保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线。
    警卫战士们把全国人民的希望化为巨大的动力，牢记毛主席“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的伟大教导，决心为革命委员会站好岗，放好哨，永做毛主席革命路线的忠实哨兵，用坚持不懈的战斗，保卫革命委员会，巩固无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
