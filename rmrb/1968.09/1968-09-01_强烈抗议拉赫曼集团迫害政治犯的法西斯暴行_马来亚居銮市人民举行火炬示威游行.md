The people of Johor Bahru, Johor State, Malaya, held a torchlight protest march in the city center on the evening of the 29th, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Rahman puppet group's persecution of political prisoners, and resolutely supporting the brave hunger strike of political prisoners illegally detained in the Muar and Woodlands concentration camps.

The demonstrators, holding torches and banners, chanted slogans along the way and distributed leaflets to the crowd.

The Rahman puppet group sent out a large number of savage "riot control teams" to brutally suppress the demonstrators and arrested ten young men and women.

According to another report, about thirty relatives of the illegally detained political prisoners sat in front of the Muar concentration camp on the 29th and prepared to go on a hunger strike to protest the Rahman puppet group's persecution of their relatives. The relatives of the political prisoners told reporters that the health of the 42 political prisoners who were on a hunger strike in the Muar concentration camp had seriously deteriorated. The relatives angrily said that their hunger strike was completely due to the persecution by the Rahman puppet group.

The political prisoners illegally detained in the Muar and Woodlands concentration camps, in order to protest the fascist atrocities of the Rahman puppet group's persecution of the people of Malaya, had been on a hunger strike for the 14th and 8th days respectively as of the 29th. Their brave struggle has gained the sympathy and support of the people of Malaya.

    新华社三十一日讯新加坡消息：据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚柔佛州居銮市人民群众，二十九日晚在市中心举行火炬示威游行，强烈抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团迫害政治犯的法西斯暴行，坚决支持被非法拘禁在麻坡和华都牙也集中营的政治犯英勇的绝食斗争。
    示威群众手持火炬和标语沿途高呼口号，并向群众散发传单。
    拉赫曼傀儡集团派出大批凶残的“镇暴队”，对示威群众进行野蛮镇压，并逮捕了十名男女青年。
    另据报纸报道，被非法拘禁的政治犯的家属约三十人，二十九日在麻坡集中营门外静坐，并准备进行绝食斗争，以抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团迫害他们的亲人。政治犯的家属们对报纸记者说，麻坡集中营四十二位进行绝食斗争的政治犯的健康已严重地恶化。家属们激愤地说，他们的绝食行动完全是由于拉赫曼傀儡集团对他们的虐待而引起的。
    被非法拘禁在麻坡集中营和华都牙也集中营的政治犯，为了抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团迫害马来亚人民的法西斯暴行所进行的绝食斗争，到二十九日已分别进入第十四天和第八天。他们的英勇斗争，获得了马来亚人民群众的同情和支持。
