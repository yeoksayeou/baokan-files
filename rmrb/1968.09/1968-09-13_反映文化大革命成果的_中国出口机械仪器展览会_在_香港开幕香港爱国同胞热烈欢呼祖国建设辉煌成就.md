In the midst of the great situation where the mountains and rivers of the motherland are all red, Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots vow to carry on the struggle against the British and suppress violence to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 11th - On the joyous day when all the revolutionary committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province) in the country have been established, Hong Kong patriots from various circles have been visiting the "Chinese Export Machinery and Instruments Exhibition" held in Hong Kong with great joy. They enthusiastically celebrate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the industrial front, and the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

This exhibition displays more than 1,500 items, most of which were produced during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland. These include the precision flat grinder with a cross-working table recently developed by the Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, various mechanical instruments of world advanced level, as well as "Red Flag" sedans and "Beijing" off-road vehicles, etc. Hong Kong patriots saw from these exhibits the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the industrial front in the motherland and the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. They further understood the great significance of the strategic policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao. After the great news that all the revolutionary committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province) in the country have been established reached Hong Kong, the exhibition hall was filled with joyous cheers. The audience carefully observed each exhibit while enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The exhibition opened on August 28th. In half a month, the number of visitors has reached 100,000. They include workers, peasants, fishermen, students, businessmen, and patriots from various strata, as well as overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, Australia, America, Europe, and friends and businessmen from more than 20 countries.

The "Red Flag" high-level sedan with three rows of seats and the new off-road vehicle, which are being exhibited in Hong Kong for the first time, attracted tens of thousands of visitors. Everyone couldn't help but touch the cars designed and manufactured by the motherland with excitement. On these two cars, there were countless fingerprints from the visitors, expressing the deep love of Hong Kong patriots and overseas Chinese for the great leader Chairman Mao and the socialist motherland. As soon as the young students arrived, they recognized the grass-green off-road car as the one that the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao rode in 1966 when they received the Red Guards and revolutionary masses. They tightly surrounded this off-road car, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" over and over again. They stood in line to go up to the car. They reviewed the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao over the past two years, and were greatly inspired.

Hong Kong patriots regard this exhibition as a living textbook for learning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many workers said after the visit that this exhibition gave us a vivid and concrete lesson on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the future, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the workers of the motherland as an example, and play a leading role in the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle in Hong Kong. A worker wrote in the comment book, "All the achievements of the motherland are created under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In a word: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" Many workers, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, touched each exhibit and did not want to leave.

Many students from patriotic schools regard visiting this exhibition as their first lesson of the new school year. More than a hundred representatives of teachers and students from the Chinese Middle School, who are being cruelly persecuted by the Hong Kong British authorities, said excitedly after the visit, "We have seen with our own eyes the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the industrial front, which is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The splendid achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the motherland have greatly inspired the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon who are carrying out the struggle against the British and suppress violence. We will definitely fight alongside the patriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, persist in the struggle, and carry on the struggle against the British and suppress violence to the end."

Overseas Chinese from Asia, Europe, America, and Australia said excitedly after the visit, "Before liberation, old China had to rely on imports for everything; now many precision machinery and instruments can be manufactured, which is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership. Today, as a Chinese person, I feel extremely proud and honored." They refuted the slanders, curses, and attacks of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China with these vivid and concrete examples. They said, "The curses of the enemy cannot shake a single hair of the motherland!" An overseas Chinese said, "The facts before us prove that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent!"

    香港开幕香港爱国同胞热烈欢呼祖国建设辉煌成就
    在祖国山河一片红的大好形势下，港九爱国同胞誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底
    新华社香港十一日电在香港各界爱国同胞欢呼全国（除台湾省外）各省、市、自治区革命委员会全部成立，祖国山河一片红的大喜日子里，连日来，怀着无比喜悦的心情，前往参观正在香港举行的“中国出口机械仪器展览会”。他们热烈欢呼祖国无产阶级文化大革命在工业战线上所取得的丰硕成果，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    这个展览会展出的一千五百多件展品，大部分是在祖国无产阶级文化大革命期间生产出来的，其中包括杭州机床厂最近试制成功的十字工作台型精密平面磨床和各种具有世界先进水平的机械仪器，以及“红旗”牌轿车、“北京”牌越野车等等。香港爱国同胞从这些展品中，看到了祖国无产阶级文化大革命在工业战线上所取得的伟大成就，看到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，进一步体会到伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的战略方针的伟大意义。在全国（除台湾省外）各省、市、自治区革命委员会全部成立的特大喜讯传到香港后，展览会会场里一片欢腾，观众们一面认真地观看各个展品，一面热烈欢呼祖国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    展览会是在八月二十八日开幕的。半个月内，观众已达十万人次。他们中包括工人、农民、渔民、学生、工商界和各阶层爱国同胞，还有来自东南亚、澳大利亚、美洲、欧洲等地的华侨，以及二十多个国家的外国朋友和商人。
    首次在香港展出的“红旗”牌三排座位高级轿车和新型越野车吸引着万千观众，人人都禁不住以兴奋的心情伸手去抚摸一下祖国自己设计、制造的汽车。在这两辆汽车上印满了观众密密麻麻的指纹，表达了香港爱国同胞和海外华侨无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席和社会主义祖国的深厚的感情。青年学生一到场，就认出那辆草绿色的越野汽车，就是伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席在一九六六年接见红卫兵和革命群众时所乘坐的那一种汽车。他们紧紧地围着这辆越野汽车一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他们排着队等候到汽车上去站一站。他们回顾了两年多来伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，受到了极大的鼓舞。
    香港爱国同胞把这个展览会作为学习无产阶级文化大革命的活教材。许多工人在参观后说，这个展览会给我们生动地、具体地上了一堂无产阶级文化大革命的教育课。今后，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以祖国的工人阶级为榜样，在香港的反帝爱国斗争中发挥主力军的作用。一位工人在留言簿上写道，祖国的一切成就，都是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下创造出来的。千言万语一句话：毛主席万岁！万万岁！许多工人在参观时，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，抚摸着每一件展品，久久不愿离去。
    许多爱国学校的学生把参观这个展览会作为新学年的第一课。受港英当局残酷迫害的中华中学师生代表一百多人参观后激动地说，我们亲眼看到祖国无产阶级文化大革命中在工业战线上所取得的成就，内心无比激动，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得的辉煌成就，给正在进行反英抗暴斗争的港九爱国同胞极大鼓舞，我们一定和港九各界爱国同胞一道，坚持斗争，誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    来自亚洲、欧洲、美洲、澳大利亚的华侨参观后兴奋地说，解放前，旧中国什么都要靠进口；现在许多精密机械仪器都能够制造，这是毛主席的英明领导的结果。今天作为一个中国人感到无比光荣和自豪。他们在这许多生动、具体的事例面前，有力地驳斥了帝、修、反对中国无产阶级文化大革命的造谣、咒骂和攻击。他们说，敌人的诅咒绝不能动摇祖国的一根毫毛！一位华侨说，摆在我们面前的事实证明，无产阶级文化大革命就是好得很！
