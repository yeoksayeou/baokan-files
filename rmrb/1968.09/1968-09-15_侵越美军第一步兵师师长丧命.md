The commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, General Wey, was killed on September 13 when the helicopter he was riding in crashed. The Associated Press lamented that this brigadier general was the fourth U.S. general to be killed in the Vietnam War.

According to reports, the battle on September 13 took place near Luc Ninh in the province of Phu Long in South Vietnam. Due to the fierce attacks by the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam, nearly 120 U.S. invaders were killed or wounded that day. When Wey's helicopter crashed, seven other U.S. aggressors on board also perished. (Xinhua News Agency)

    侵越美军第一步兵师师长丧命
    美国侵略军第一步兵师师长韦尔，十三日在指挥美国侵略军时因他乘坐的直升飞机坠毁而丧命。美联社哀叹，这个少将军衔的美军头目，是美国强盗在侵越战争中“被打死的第四个将军”。
    据报道，十三日的战斗发生在越南南方平隆省禄宁附近。由于越南南方人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击，韦尔指挥的美国侵略军在十三日被打死打伤近一百二十人。韦尔乘坐的飞机坠毁时，还有另外七个同机的美国强盗丧命。　（据新华社讯）
