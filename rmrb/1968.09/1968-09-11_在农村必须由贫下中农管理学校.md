Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To realize the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, to have the participation of the working masses, to cooperate with the PLA soldiers, and to implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In rural areas, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

In Rural Areas, Schools Must Be Managed by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
—Report on the Educational Revolution in Three Communes of Laoshan County, Shandong Province

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students in Hetai, Wanggezhuang, and Zhonghan Communes of Laoshan County, under the leadership of the county and commune revolutionary committees and with the help of the PLA, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev, reformed the old educational system, and began to change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools. The most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—managed the schools, making the schools' appearance completely new. The path they have taken fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's great directive on realizing the proletarian educational revolution: "In rural areas, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." It fully demonstrates the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line!

Rural Schools Must Be Managed by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." After liberation, the situation of rural primary and secondary schools was somewhat better compared to the situation before liberation when they were completely monopolized by the exploiting classes and their offspring. However, due to the stubborn implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line by China's Khrushchev and his agents, the leadership of rural schools was basically still in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals, and the old educational system had not been fundamentally overthrown.

The old educational system in schools opened the door for landlords and rich peasants and excluded the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from attending school. According to an investigation, in Zhonghan Commune, Buxi Production Brigade, which accounts for 80% of the total households, not a single child of poor and lower-middle peasants attended junior high school; while the children of landlords and rich peasants, who account for only 4% of the total households, all attended school, including nine junior high school students, three senior high school students, and one college student. In Hetai Commune, Shanjiao Production Brigade, the family of poor peasant Liu Qingxian had three generations without a single literate person. After liberation, it was with great difficulty that the ten-year-old fourth child was sent to school, but after three years of study, he was expelled, with the excuse that he had "exceeded the age limit and should engage in labor." The poor and lower-middle peasants were very indignant about this.

The old educational system followed the capitalist road and cultivated successors of the bourgeoisie. Under the control and domination of the revisionist educational line and bourgeois intellectuals, schools detached themselves from proletarian politics, from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and from the three great revolutionary movements. Many students, under the corruption of the revisionist goods such as "after graduation, one can become an engineer, expert, or cadre," looked down on the countryside and the laboring people, yearned for the bourgeois way of life. Many poor and lower-middle peasants painfully said: The more one studies in such a school, the farther one is from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some who graduated from primary school looked down on their parents, those who graduated from middle school looked down on brigade cadres, and those who graduated from college could not stay in the countryside. In Hetai Commune, Sungezhuang Production Brigade, most of the students trained by the school had left the countryside, and now some production brigades cannot even find an accountant. Some students, although they returned to the countryside, the knowledge they learned was of no use. In Hetai Commune, Shanjiao Production Brigade, the fifth Production Brigade had a high school graduate who worked as an accountant for a year but failed to settle the accounts for three years. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Such a school makes one more stupid the more one studies."

In the past, rural schools, although located in the countryside, were detached from the leadership of the local communes and brigades, did not run schools according to the needs of the countryside, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had no right to interfere in school affairs. In Hetai Commune, Zhaoqiling Production Brigade, one year when they asked the school to help eradicate pests, the teacher said: "The county has not made a regulation, and stopping classes will affect the progress, how can we do it?"

"Education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools broke through the school gates and developed into a profound social revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants exposed and criticized the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev in pushing the entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the old educational system. Through the revolutionary criticism, they further realized that the reason why their children were not allowed to be educated by themselves but were educated by bourgeois intellectuals to become successors of the bourgeoisie was that the schools were not managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the leadership of education was not in the hands of the proletariat. The poor and lower-middle peasants must thoroughly liberate themselves by thoroughly smashing the revisionist educational line and shattering the old educational system, taking over the schools, and letting the proletariat occupy this position. They said: "In the past, not being able to go to school was caused by the landlords, but today not being able to go to school is caused by China's Khrushchev." Some also said: "If the revisionist educational line continues to poison the youth, it will not be long before China changes color."

The county and commune revolutionary committees enthusiastically supported the revolutionary actions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The three commune revolutionary committees, after repeated investigations and discussions, decided to have the communes manage the middle schools and the brigades manage the primary schools, establishing a three-in-one leadership team composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, commune or brigade cadres, and active elements among the teachers and students in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, to manage the schools.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are Best at Managing Schools

"We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students, through criticizing the revisionist educational line, established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and put forward many valuable opinions on the educational revolution. Practice has proven that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants not only care the most about managing schools but also understand proletarian education the best and are the most capable of managing schools. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "shortening the school system and revolutionizing education," reforming the old school system, with primary school for five years, junior high school for two years, and senior high school for two years, which has been fully implemented in the three pilot communes. Now, twenty-six primary schools with better foundations have also set up junior high school classes, so that the children of poor and lower-middle peasants can attend primary school without leaving the village and junior high school within three miles. Just as the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out forty-one years ago in the article "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "The peasant movement has rapidly raised the cultural level of the peasants. In a short period of time, tens of thousands of schools will emerge in the countryside, unlike the intellectuals and so-called 'educators,' who merely call for 'universal education,' calling and calling but still just empty words."

To manage the schools well, the poor and lower-middle peasants also formulated a series of measures. The poor and lower-middle peasants, leadership team members, and revolutionary teachers and students in Hongdong Production Brigade of Wanggezhuang Commune jointly formulated the method of managing the school as follows: (1) Hold a meeting of brigade cadres, representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, and representatives of revolutionary teachers and students at the beginning of each month to summarize the previous period's school work and formulate the plan for the next period; (2) At the end of the month, each production brigade organizes a symposium with teachers and students and poor and lower-middle peasants to check the school's implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the school's connection with the production brigade; (3) The production brigade and production team include school work in the agenda; the school cares about the work of the production brigade and strengthens the relationship between teachers and students and the poor and lower-middle peasants; (4) The brigade and school jointly grasp the political and ideological work of teachers, students, and parents; teachers and students attend the Mao Zedong Thought lecture meetings organized by the production brigade on time, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism; (5) Let the poor and lower-middle peasants step onto the podium to teach the students; organize students to participate in production labor in the production brigade in an organized and planned manner. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, brigade cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students excitedly said: "Teachers stepping out of the school gate and poor and lower-middle peasants stepping into the school gate is the first time in history, it is the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thought! 'Such a school, the more we run, the more energetic we become.'"

The poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools has strongly promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, pushing the proletarian educational revolution to flourish, and the appearance of the schools has undergone fundamental changes. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has dominated the teaching content, and the red successors who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao are growing rapidly. The relationship between teachers and students, between the school and the production brigade, has become closer, and the deeds of respecting teachers and loving students are numerous. The most notable change is:

1. The proletarian political direction has been adhered to, and the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought has been placed at the forefront of all school work.

When a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois intellectuals dominated the schools, they did everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the revolutionary teachers and students' study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. In 1964, the students in Zhaoqiling Production Brigade of Hetai Commune voluntarily organized two Mao Zedong Thought study groups, both of which were forcibly disbanded by China's Khrushchev's agent in Laoshan County. After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, they thoroughly criticized the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in opposing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, listing the study of Chairman Mao's works as the most important course in the school, and universally established the institutions of "daily reading," "daily listening," and "speaking and using," and carried out the "three loyalties" activities, using Mao Zedong Thought to dominate all the work of the school. At the same time, they organized teachers and students to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of poor and lower-middle peasant families and production brigades, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to change their worldview. Revolutionary teachers and students, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, formed many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, active in the fields, courtyards, streets, and families, adopting methods such as cultural and entertainment propaganda, block-by-block household visits, and delivering the latest directives to the doorsteps of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many revolutionary teachers and students are active elements in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the school, excellent propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought in the production brigade, and cadres in the family study class and the core of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

2. The fundamental problem of the educational revolution, what kind of people to cultivate and how to cultivate them, has been solved.

The three communes have more than twenty thousand primary and secondary school students, accounting for one-fifth of the total population, which is a considerable force. Under the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, many students do not understand class struggle and production struggle, look down on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and do not want to participate in labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants painfully said: "Children go to school, the more they study, the more confused they become, the deeper the 'learning,' the more 'revisionist' it becomes! What use is such a school?" After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, they followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," and focused on class education. They adopted methods such as frequently giving students lectures on bitter memories and sweet memories, lecturing on the current class struggle situation in the countryside, organizing students to participate in social revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies, and visiting the poor and the sick, to implement the close combination of school, family, and social education, striving to improve students' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and cultivate students' deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhaoqiling Production Brigade of Hetai Commune brought the begging basket and begging bowl from the old society to the classroom and accused the old society of blood and tears to the students, giving a profound education to the revolutionary teachers and students. They said: Remembering the bitterness of the old society makes us hate even more the "theory of the merits of exploitation" advocated by China's Khrushchev; thinking of the sweetness of the new society makes us more determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution. Now, students' awareness of class struggle and line struggle has greatly improved, and many production brigades' students have voluntarily organized to monitor the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

To strengthen the feelings for the laboring people and cultivate new-type laborers who are both workers and farmers, both intellectuals and soldiers, while focusing on class education, each school also arranges a certain amount of time for students to participate in collective production labor. Some schools even set up small factories and farms. Some have established fixed production labor bases and implemented diligent work and frugal study, self-reliance, solving the tuition, book fees, and office expenses. Now, the students in these three communes generally work more than one hundred days a year, fundamentally solving the phenomenon of schools being detached from labor and reality. Many poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "This is really our own school."

3. According to the proletarian worldview, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, the teaching staff is transformed, solving the problem of relying on whom to run the school.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The most important problem in a school is "the selection of the principal and teachers and the formulation of the educational policy." "The problem of educational reform is mainly the problem of teachers." According to Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants regard the establishment of a revolutionary teaching staff that combines with workers and peasants as an important task in carrying out the proletarian educational revolution at present.

Most of the teachers in these three communes were students trained in cities after liberation, and some were old intellectuals before liberation. Due to various reasons, and long-term detachment from labor, their thoughts and feelings are very different from those of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and even incompatible. After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, they first, through revolutionary criticism, thoroughly cleaned up the teaching staff, organized revolutionary teachers to step out of the school gates, walk into society, and throw themselves into the fiery three great revolutionary movements, combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly transform their worldview. Most of the teachers in these three communes can insist on participating in collective production labor for two days a week and guarantee labor for seventy days a year. Many teachers have already prepared hoes and spades, and whenever they have time, they participate in collective labor, strengthening the concept of labor, cultivating proletarian feelings, and tempering their absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao.

After the teachers combined with workers and peasants, their thoughts and feelings underwent great changes. Some who were not willing to be rural primary school teachers, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and decided to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside for life. Some even rushed to the deep mountains and islands to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. In Wanggezhuang Commune, there is a female teacher who graduated from Qingdao City and went to Xishan Production Brigade. After that, she slept on the same kang, ate from the same pot, worked, and studied with the sixty-year-old poor peasant old woman, a model worker in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Qingdao City, Jiang Zhonghua, and became one with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many old farmers affectionately called her "good daughter."

Some old intellectuals who came from the old society and had serious habits began to put down their airs and go to the poor and lower-middle peasants to learn. In Hetai Commune, there was an old teacher who had studied in private schools for a few years. Although he came from a poor peasant family, due to long-term detachment from labor, he was incompatible with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they even mocked him as "old master." After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, he participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the production brigade, composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, brigade cadres, and teachers, and after struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, he realized the harm of intellectuals detaching from the laboring people, his thoughts underwent great changes, and he actively participated in collective production labor, helping brigade cadres with their work. The poor and lower-middle peasants said he was: "The old master has become the second brigade leader."

Workers, peasants, and soldiers stepping onto the podium is another major measure to transform the teaching staff. Now, in the primary and secondary schools of these three communes, workers, peasants, and soldiers are universally hired as teachers. The chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association and the old poor peasants with deep hatred are invited to lecture on class struggle history; brigade cadres are invited to lecture on the situation; workers are invited to explain agricultural machinery and electrical knowledge; technical personnel and accountants are invited to explain agricultural knowledge and applied arithmetic; PLA soldiers and militia platoon leaders are invited to explain the four firsts, the three-eighths style, and conduct military training, etc. These comrades' lectures are closely combined with the actual situation of the three great revolutionary movements, profound and vivid, and easy to understand, enabling students to learn a lot that cannot be learned from books. Workers, peasants, and soldiers entering the school gates and stepping onto the podium have thoroughly changed the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools, enriched the teaching staff, changed the class composition of the teaching staff, and promoted the in-depth development of the educational revolution.

A Sharp and Complex Class Struggle

The poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools is not a simple change in organizational form but a profound ideological revolution and social revolution, a sharp and complex class struggle. When Laoshan County's Hetai, Wanggezhuang, and Zhonghan Communes began to carry out the rural educational revolution, they encountered the sabotage of class enemies and the obstruction of old habits.

When the news of the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools spread, the class enemies immediately released a series of evil winds, saying that "teachers will all be demoted," "the school will be completely changed," and so on, spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, destroying the relationship between the production brigade and the school, and destroying the relationship between the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers. Some people with serious rightist conservative thoughts said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants are illiterate, how can they manage the schools?" Some thoughts also arose among a part of the teachers, with some teachers thinking that they were demoted from being led by the county to being led by the commune; some teachers also thought that the power of the school had been seized by the revolutionary faction, and they did not understand the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools.

In response to this situation, many production brigades and schools jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the participation of brigade cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and teachers, deeply studying Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts and related teachings on intellectuals combining with workers and peasants, criticizing the old educational system's serious detachment from proletarian politics, from the Party's leadership, from the laboring people, and from the three great revolutionary movements, and reviewing the superiority of the village party branch's unified arrangement of school work in the early days of liberation. In the revolutionary criticism, many teachers realized that the various obstacles appearing in the current educational revolution, in the end, reflected the resistance of the exploiting class and old habits to the proletarian educational revolution, and also reflected the bourgeois thoughts of some teachers who thought they were great and looked down on the workers and peasants, which was the poison of China's Khrushchev not yet eliminated. Therefore, whether to walk the road of combining with workers and peasants, whether to acknowledge the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools, is the focal point of the struggle between the two lines, two thoughts, and two worldviews on the educational front, and is a big issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the study class, everyone also listed many facts to illustrate that although we have seized the power of a handful of capitalist roaders in terms of organization, the poison of the revisionist educational line has not been eliminated politically and ideologically, the old educational system has not been thoroughly reformed, and the ideological system of bourgeois education has not been thoroughly smashed. Therefore, the phenomenon of "backward flow" in education often occurs. To thoroughly reform education, complete the entire struggle, criticism, and transformation tasks in the school, and truly serve proletarian politics, it is not enough to rely on the revolutionary teachers and students in the school, but the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage.

On the basis of improving the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, revolutionary teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants united, propagated Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, propagated the Party's policies, exposed the class enemies' plots to split the revolutionary ranks and sabotage the proletarian educational revolution. When the class enemies in Shilaoren Primary School of Zhonghan Commune heard that the poor and lower-middle peasants were going to manage the schools, they spread the word: "Let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves." They incited teachers and students to fight "internal wars" and create divisions. After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed, they first mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," carried out revolutionary criticism, exposed the class enemies, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

"The May 7th Directive is the guideline for the educational revolution"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, reasoning is construction, destruction comes first, and construction is within it." While focusing on the educational criticism, each school also pays great attention to closely combining criticism with struggle, criticism, and transformation, studying one of Chairman Mao's related directives, criticizing one of China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies, and establishing one new system.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students deeply felt from practice that the reform of rural schools cannot be carried out in isolation but must, with Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the guideline, be closely combined with the development and consolidation of rural people's communes and closely combined with the practice of the three great revolutionary movements in rural areas, turning rural areas into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. Many production brigades, in accordance with this spirit, set up "May 7th-type" schools that include the production brigade, production team, and school as a three-in-one entity. Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities should still be run, I mainly talk about the need to run universities of science and engineering, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the road of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." Following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary committee of Wanggezhuang Commune, starting from the needs of the three great revolutionary movements in rural areas, established a new type of "Communist Labor University," recommending a group of young workers and peasants with junior high school education and a period of practical experience to study at the Communist Labor University. The school completely sets up courses and regulates the school system according to the needs of the local three great revolutionary movements. Workers and peasants are teachers, and workshops and fields are classrooms, studying while working. This school, as soon as it appeared, received strong support from the county revolutionary committee and the commune revolutionary committee and was warmly praised by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao's brilliant educational revolutionary thoughts and a series of his latest directives on the proletarian educational revolution are like a lighthouse shining with rays of light, pointing out the correct direction for doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in these three communes are determined to take Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the guideline and the latest directives as the compass, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, complete the great historical task of the entire struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school, and turn the commune, production brigade, and school into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

### 在农村必须由贫下中农管理学校

专栏：

    毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”
    在农村必须由贫下中农管理学校
    ——山东省崂山县三个公社教育革命情况调查报告
    崂山县河套、王哥庄、中韩三个公社的广大贫下中农、革命干部和革命师生，在县、公社革命委员会领导下，在解放军帮助下，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，改革旧的教育制度，开始改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校，使学校面貌焕然一新。他们所走过的道路，充分证明了毛主席关于实现无产阶级教育革命，“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”这一伟大指示的无比英明，无比正确！充分显示了毛主席无产阶级教育路线的巨大威力！
    农村的学校必须由贫下中农来管
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”解放后，农村中小学教育比起解放前完全为剥削阶级及其子女所垄断时的情况，好了一些。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人顽固地推行反革命修正主义教育路线，农村学校的领导权基本上还是把持在资产阶级知识分子手里，旧的教育制度并没有从根本上摧垮。
    学校推行的旧的教育制度，为地主、富农大开方便之门，排斥贫下中农子女入学。据调查，中韩公社卜西大队占总户数百分之八十的贫下中农子女，没有一个上到初中的；而只占总户数百分之四的地主富农子女却全部入学，其中并有初中生九个，高中生三个，大学生一个。河套公社山角大队贫农刘青先家三辈没有一个识字的。解放后好不容易把十岁的老四送到学校，念了三年书就被撵回来了，说什么“超过年龄，应该劳动”。贫下中农对此非常气愤。
    旧的教育制度，走的是资本主义道路，培养的是资产阶级接班人。学校在修正主义教育路线和资产阶级知识分子的控制、把持下，脱离了无产阶级政治，脱离了贫下中农，脱离了三大革命运动。有许多学生在
  “毕业以后可以当工程师、专家、干部”的修正主义黑货的腐蚀下，看不起农村，看不起劳动人民，向往资产阶级生活方式。许多贫下中农沉痛地说：这样的学校，越学离贫下中农越远。有的小学毕业看不起爹娘，中学毕业看不起队干部，大学毕业咱农村就搁不下了。河套公社孙戈庄大队从学校培养出的学生，大部分都脱离了农村，现在有的生产队连个会计也找不到。有的学生虽然回到农村，可是学到的知识没有用。河套公社山角大队第五生产队有个高中毕业生，回乡当了一年会计，三年没结清账。贫下中农说：“这样的学校越上越蠢。”
    过去的农村学校，虽然设在农村，却脱离当地社、队领导，不根据农村需要办学，贫下中农对学校的事无权过问。河套公社赵家岭大队有一年找学校帮助消灭虫害，学校老师说什么：“县里没有规定，停课影响进度怎么办？”
    “教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，学校的斗、批、改冲破了校门，发展成为深刻的社会大革命。广大贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的一整套反革命修正主义教育路线和旧教育制度犯下的滔天罪行，进行了大揭发、大批判。通过革命大批判更加认识到，自己的孩子为什么自己无权培养，被资产阶级知识分子培养成为资产阶级的接班人，就是因为学校不由贫下中农管，教育的领导权没有在无产阶级手里。贫下中农要彻底翻身解放，必须彻底摧毁修正主义的教育路线，砸烂旧的教育制度，把学校管起来，让无产阶级占领这个阵地。他们说：“过去捞不着上学是地主造成的，今天捞不着上学是中国赫鲁晓夫搞的。”也有的说：“如果继续让修正主义教育路线毒害青年，不用多久，中国就要变颜色了。”
    县和公社革委会热情地支持了贫下中农的革命行动。三个公社革委会经过反复调查，多次酝酿，决定中学由公社管理，小学下放到大队管理，建立了由贫下中农、公社或大队干部、学校师生中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子组成三结合的领导班子，管理学校。
      贫下中农最能管理好学校
      “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”广大贫下中农和革命师生大破修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，对教育革命提出了许多宝贵意见。实践证明，广大贫下中农不仅最关心管理学校，而且最懂得无产阶级教育，最能管好学校。他们遵照毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的教导，对旧学制进行了改革，小学五年，初中二年，高中二年，三个试点公社已全部试行了新学制。现在有二十六处基础较好的小学还附设了初中班，贫下中农子女上小学不出村，上中学不过三里。正如伟大领袖毛主席四十一年前在《湖南农民运动考察报告》一文中指出的一样：“农民运动发展的结果，农民的文化程度迅速地提高了。不久的时间内，全省当有几万所学校在乡村中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓‘教育家’者流，空唤‘普及教育’，唤来唤去还是一句废话。”
    贫下中农为了管好学校，还制定了一系列的措施。王哥庄公社港东大队的贫下中农、领导班子成员、革命师生共同制定了管理学校的办法是：（一）每月月初召开生产队干部、贫下中农代表、革命师生代表会，总结前段学校工作和制定下段工作计划；（二）月终各生产队组织有师生、贫下中农参加的座谈会，检查学校贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命教育路线的情况，检查学校与生产队的联系；（三）生产大队、生产队把学校工作列入议事日程；学校关心生产队的工作，密切师生与贫下中农的关系；（四）大队和学校共同抓好教师、学生、家长的政治思想工作，师生按时参加生产队召开的毛泽东思想讲用会，与贫下中农共同斗私批修；（五）让贫下中农登上讲台，给学生讲课；学生有组织有计划地到生产队参加生产劳动。许多贫下中农、队干部和革命师生激动地说：“教师走出校门，贫下中农走进校门，是开天辟地第一次，是毛主席教育革命思想的光辉胜利！”“这样的学校我们越办越有劲”。
    贫下中农管理学校，有力地促进了学校的斗、批、改，推动了无产阶级教育革命的蓬勃发展，学校面貌发生了根本变化。战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅了教学内容，无限忠于毛主席的红色接班人正在迅速成长，师生之间、学校和生产大队之间的关系密切了，尊师爱生的事迹层出不穷。特别显著的变化是：
      一、坚持了无产阶级政治方向，把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在学校一切工作的首位。
    党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子统治学校时，千方百计阻挠和破坏革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想。一九六四年，河套公社赵家岭大队的学生自动组织了两个毛主席著作学习小组，都被中国赫鲁晓夫在崂山县的代理人强行砍掉。贫下中农管理学校以后，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反对学生活学活用毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，把毛主席著作的学习列为学校头等重要的课程，普遍建立了“天天读”、“天天听”、“讲用会”等制度，开展“三忠于”活动，用毛泽东思想统帅学校的一切工作。同时，还组织师生参加贫下中农家庭学习班和生产队的学习班，和贫下中农共同活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观。革命师生在贫下中农的帮助下，组成许多毛泽东思想宣传队，活跃在田间、场院、街头、家庭，采取文娱宣传、分片包户、送最高指示上门等方法，及时把毛主席的最新指示传达给贫下中农。不少革命师生在学校是活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，在生产队是毛泽东思想的优秀宣传员，在家庭是家庭学习班的辅导员和斗私批修的骨干。
      二、解决了培养什么人和怎样培养的
  教育革命的根本问题。
    这三个公社共有两万多名中小学学生，占总人口的五分之一，是一支很大的力量。在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，有许多学生不懂阶级斗争和生产斗争，看不起贫下中农，不愿参加劳动，贫下中农痛心地说：“孩子上学，越上越糊涂，‘学问’越深，‘修’味越足！这样的学校有什么用？”贫下中农管理学校以后，遵照毛主席“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级教育。他们采取经常给学生作忆苦思甜报告，讲当前农村的阶级斗争形势，组织学生参加社会上的革命大批判和对敌斗争、访贫问苦等方法，实行学校、家庭、社会教育紧密结合，努力提高学生的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，培养学生无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。河套公社赵家岭大队的贫下中农，把旧社会的要饭篮子、讨饭碗带到课堂上，向学生控诉血泪斑斑的旧社会，使广大革命师生受到深刻教育。他们说：忆旧社会的苦，使我们更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“剥削有功”论；思新社会的甜，使我们更加坚定地跟着毛主席干革命。现在，学生的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，许多大队的学生都自觉地组织起来，监视地富反坏右分子。
    为了增强对劳动人民的感情，培养亦工亦农、亦文亦武的新型劳动者，在狠抓阶级教育的同时，各学校都给学生安排一定时间，参加集体生产劳动。有的学校自己还开办了小型工厂、农场。还有的建立了固定生产劳动基地，实行勤工俭学，自力更生，解决学费、书费和办公费。现在，这三个公社的学生一般每年都能劳动一百天以上，从根本上解决了学校脱离劳动、脱离实际的现象。许多贫下中农高兴地说：“这才是咱们自己的学校。”
      三、按照无产阶级的世界观即毛泽东
  思想改造教师队伍，解决了依靠什么人办
  学的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：一个学校“最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”按照毛主席的教育革命的光辉思想，广大贫下中农把树立一支革命化的与工农结合的教师队伍，作为当前进行无产阶级教育革命的重要任务。
    这三个公社的教师，大部分是解放以后从城市培养出来的学生，也有一部分是解放前的旧知识分子。这些教师由于各种原因，加上长期脱离劳动，思想感情和贫下中农有很大距离，甚至格格不入。贫下中农管理学校以后，首先通过革命大批判，彻底清理了教师队伍，组织革命教师跨出校门，走上社会，投入火热的三大革命运动，与贫下中农结合，彻底改造世界观。这三个公社的绝大部分教师每周都能坚持两天参加集体生产劳动，每年可以保证劳动七十天。不少的教师已备齐锄、镢两大件，有空就参加集体劳动，增强劳动观念，培养无产阶级感情，锤炼对毛主席的无限忠心。
    教师和工农结合以后，思想感情发生了很大变化。有些不安心当农村小学教师的同志，在贫下中农的帮助下，斗私批修，决心在农村为贫下中农服务一辈子，有的还争先恐后到深山沟里、到海岛上为贫下中农服务。王哥庄公社有个从青岛市毕业的女教师，到西山大队后，和六十多岁的贫农老大娘、青岛市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子姜中花睡一铺炕，吃一锅饭，一同劳动，一同学习，和贫下中农打成一片，很多老农都亲切地称她“好闺女”。
    一些从旧社会过来的、习惯势力比较严重的知识分子，开始放下架子，到贫下中农中去，向贫下中农学习。河套公社有个读过几年私塾的老教师，虽然出身下中农，由于长期脱离劳动，与贫下中农格格不入，都讽刺他叫“老先生”。贫下中农管理学校以后，他参加了生产队组织的贫下中农、队干部、教师三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，经过斗私批修，认识到知识分子脱离劳动人民的危害，思想有了很大转变，主动参加集体生产劳动，帮助队干部工作。贫下中农说他是：“老先生变成了二队长”。
    工农兵登上讲台，这是改造教师队伍的又一项重大措施。现在，这三个公社的中小学普遍聘请工农兵当老师，请贫协主任、苦大仇深的老贫农讲阶级斗争史；请队干部讲形势；请工人讲解农业机械和电工常识；请技术员、会计讲解农业知识和应用算术；请解放军同志和民兵连长讲解四个第一，三八作风，进行军事训练等。这些同志讲课紧密结合三大革命运动的实际，深刻生动，通俗易懂，使学生学到了很多在书本上学不到的东西。工农兵走进校门，登上讲台，彻底改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，充实了教师队伍，改变了教师队伍的阶级成分，推动了教育革命的深入发展。
      一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争
    贫下中农管理学校，不是简单的组织形式的变化，而是一场深刻的思想大革命和社会大革命，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。崂山县河套、王哥庄、中韩三个公社开始进行农村教育革命时，曾遇到阶级敌人的破坏和旧习惯势力的阻挠。
    贫下中农要管理学校的消息一传开，阶级敌人就放出了阵阵阴风，说什么“教师都要下放了”，“学校要大换班”等等，造谣生事，挑拨离间，破坏生产队和学校的关系，破坏贫下中农和革命教师的关系。一些右倾保守思想比较严重的人说：“贫下中农是大老粗，水平低，怎么能管理学校呢？”在一部分教师中也产生了一些活思想，有的教师认为过去受县领导，改为社队管理，矮了半截；还有的教师认为学校的大权已经掌握在革命派手里，对贫下中农管理学校不理解。
    针对这种情况，许多大队和学校都联合举办了有大队干部、贫下中农和教师参加的三结合毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习毛主席教育革命思想和有关知识分子要与工农相结合的教导，针对旧教育体制严重脱离无产阶级政治、脱离党的领导、脱离劳动人民、脱离三大革命运动的现象，开展革命大批判，并回顾了解放初期，小学由村领导，学校工作由村党支部统一布置，教师既教学又做群众工作的优越性。在革命大批判中，不少教师认识到，当前教育革命中出现的各种阻力，归根结底，反映了剥削阶级和旧的习惯势力对于无产阶级教育革命的反抗，也反映了教师中那种自以为了不起、轻视工农群众的资产阶级思想，这是中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒没有肃清。因此，走不走与工农结合的道路，承认不承认贫下中农管理学校，是教育战线两条路线、两种思想、两种世界观斗争的焦点，是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。在学习班上，大家还摆出了许多事实说明，我们虽然从组织上夺了一小撮走资派的大权，但是修正主义教育路线的流毒并没有从政治上、思想上肃清，旧的教育制度并没有彻底改革，资产阶级教育的思想体系还没有彻底摧垮，因此，教育“回潮”的现象时常发生。要彻底改革教育，完成学校的全部斗、批、改任务，使教育真正为无产阶级政治服务，光靠学校中的革命师生是不行的，必须由贫下中农来管理。
    在提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，革命教师和贫下中农团结在一起，宣传毛主席教育革命思想，宣传党的政策，揭露了阶级敌人分裂革命队伍，破坏无产阶级教育革命的种种阴谋诡计。中韩公社石老人小学的阶级敌人听说贫下中农要管理学校时，就散布说：“要让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。”挑动师生打“内战”，搞分裂。贫下中农管理以后，首先发动革命师生学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，开展革命大批判，揪出了阶级敌人，很快就实现了革命大联合。
    “五·七”指示是教育革命的纲领
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”各学校在狠抓教育大批判的同时，十分注意把大批判和斗批改紧密结合起来，学习一个毛主席的有关指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个修正主义谬论，立起一项新制度。
    广大贫下中农和革命师生从实践中深深体会到，农村学校的改革不能孤立进行，必须以毛主席“五·七”指示为纲，同发展和巩固农村人民公社紧密结合起来，同农村三大革命运动的实践紧密结合起来，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。许多大队本着这一精神，举办了包括生产大队、生产队和学校三位一体的“五·七”型学校。毛主席最近深刻指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”遵照毛主席指出的方向，王哥庄公社革委会从农村三大革命运动的需要出发，创办了一所新型的“共产主义劳动大学”，由贫下中农推荐一批有初中文化程度、经过一段劳动实践的青年工人、农民，进共产主义劳动大学学习。学校完全根据当地三大革命运动的需要设置课程，规定学制。由工农当教师，以车间、田地为课堂，边劳动，边学习，这所学校一出现，就得到县革委会和公社革委会的大力支持，受到广大贫下中农的热烈称赞。
    毛主席的光辉的教育革命思想和关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列最新指示，象光芒四射的灯塔，指明了搞好学校斗、批、改的正确方向。现在，这三个公社的广大贫下中农和革命师生决心以毛主席的“五·七”指示为纲，以最新指示为指针，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，完成学校中全部斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，把公社、大队、学校都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
