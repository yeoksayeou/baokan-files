The U.S. monopoly capitalists are hurrying to stage the presidential election farce every four years. This ugly performance reflects the U.S. ruling clique's internal and external difficulties and their desperate situation; it reflects the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside and incapable of action. At the same time, it also shows that the more U.S. imperialism is on the verge of collapse, the more it will intensify its reactionary policies of anti-communism, anti-people, and counter-revolution, and desperately struggle to the death.

This U.S. "election" is being held at a time when U.S. imperialism is in unprecedented difficulties both domestically and internationally. The people's armed revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging; the waves of workers and students in Europe, America, and other capitalist countries fighting against U.S. imperialism and their own reactionaries have given a powerful shock to the entire capitalist world; the financial crisis that the capitalist world has not seen in forty years has seriously shaken the dollar's "hegemony" in the capitalist world; the great new storm of anti-violence struggles by African Americans in more than a hundred cities has greatly shaken the reactionary rule of U.S. monopoly capital. These events are like one noose after another tightening around the neck of U.S. imperialism, making it impossible to escape.

The two puppets of the U.S. monopoly capitalists, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, recently held their respective conventions and other election activities to stage the presidential "election" farce. Despite the fact that both parties have used every trick in the book to try to deceive the people and vie for the presidential "throne," they have to admit that the U.S. policy on Vietnam has "failed" in the military, political, and diplomatic aspects and has "made serious mistakes"; domestically, facing the surging people's struggles, they lament that the U.S. is a "divided nation." Their election platforms cannot provide a lifeline for the U.S. domestic and foreign policies, which are facing dead ends and crises everywhere. It is under these circumstances that these two bourgeois parties are increasingly shedding their beautiful disguises to deceive the people and tearing off the masks that supposedly distinguish the two parties, and are vying to advocate the implementation of counter-revolutionary two-pronged policies at home and abroad.

The U.S. monopoly capitalists' election farce shows that in foreign policy, the increasingly disastrous failure of the U.S. war in Vietnam is the center of their disputes. The strategists, politicians, and party hacks of the two parties, while sometimes singing in unison and sometimes attacking each other, are all trying to find a way out of the predicament for the U.S. ruling clique. However, whether it is the Democratic Party's "decent and lasting solution" or the Republican Party's "fair and equal solution," it ultimately boils down to wanting to use the two counter-revolutionary tactics of war and "peace" to threaten and lure the heroic Vietnamese people into laying down their arms and surrendering. It is well known that the two-pronged strategy of war and "peace" is nothing new. U.S. imperialism, in close collusion with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, has been using the two-pronged strategy of war and "peace" against the Vietnamese people, attempting to gain on the "negotiation" table what cannot be obtained on the battlefield, while at the same time, under the cover of "peace talks," it is even more frantically pursuing the war of aggression in Vietnam. However, they have not only failed to save U.S. imperialism from failure but have made U.S. imperialism sink deeper and deeper into the Vietnam War quagmire, unable to extricate itself. Now, both the Democratic and Republican parties are clinging to this piece of junk as a lifeline, which precisely reflects the desperate and helpless situation of the U.S. imperialist behemoth.

On domestic issues, the surging struggle of African Americans for freedom and equal rights has made the U.S. monopoly capitalists tremble with fear. The Republican Party shouts loudly about maintaining the "law and order" that represents the interests of monopoly capital and "will not allow violent behavior"; the Democratic Party promises to make "great and sustained efforts to deal with lawless acts." On the other hand, both parties have issued a lot of blank checks, such as eliminating racial discrimination, rebuilding slums, increasing employment, etc., in an attempt to achieve the purpose of politically deceiving the people. However, whether it is brutal suppression or verbal deception, it cannot extinguish the flames of the African American struggle for liberation, but will only further raise the political awareness of African Americans and promote the development of the struggle.

This election farce also shows that the awakening American people are increasingly seeing through the hypocrisy of bourgeois "elections" and the reactionary nature of the so-called "two-party system." They realize that the "election" farce staged by the U.S. ruling clique is merely a political deception scheme created to maintain its reactionary rule and deceive the people. Whether it is Humphrey, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, or Nixon, the Republican Party's presidential candidate, they are merely agents of the monopoly capitalists. The American people not only express indifference and dissatisfaction with the two parties' elections but also take strong actions to protest their reactionary policies. Despite the heavy security in Miami during the Republican Party convention, black anti-violence struggles and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations still broke out there. When the Democratic Party held its meeting in Chicago, it surrounded the venue with barbed wire and mobilized more than 26,000 fascist police to suppress the people, but during the convention, large numbers of people still held day-and-night demonstrations against the Vietnam policy. The largest demonstration had tens of thousands of participants. They rushed into the hotel where the convention headquarters was located and fought fiercely with the police.

The number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, sent frequent signals to the U.S. ruling clique during the U.S. bourgeois politicians' election farce, creating conditions for further collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. They recently colluded with the leaders of the two parties to help the U.S. monopoly capitalists deceive the masses and gain political capital, while the Democratic and Republican parties also attach great importance to further collusion with the Soviet revisionists in their elections. The Republican leader Nixon expressed his intention to visit the Soviet Union on the eve of the Republican Party convention, and the Democratic leader Johnson was not to be outdone, also planning to visit the Soviet Union. Both sides are doing their best to curry favor with the Soviet revisionists, the biggest accomplice and running dog.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be executed by the people of the whole world. Other U.S. accomplices will be the same." U.S. imperialism is already on the verge of collapse, while the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world are surging and thriving. No matter which party or person the U.S. monopoly capitalists send to the White House, they cannot reverse the fate of U.S. imperialism ultimately heading towards destruction.

    美国垄断资产阶级加紧上演总统竞选丑剧
    美国统治集团内外交困走投无路
    觉醒中的美国人民正日益识破资产阶级“选举”的虚伪性和所谓“两党制”的反动本质
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国垄断资产阶级最近正在加紧上演四年一度的总统竞选丑剧。这场丑恶的表演，反映了美国统治集团内外交困、走投无路的窘境；反映了美帝国主义外强中干、力不从心的纸老虎本质，同时也说明了美帝国主义越濒临灭亡，它就越要加紧推行反共、反人民、反革命的反动政策，疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。
    这次美国“大选”是在美帝国主义在国内外都陷入空前的困境的情况下举行的。亚非拉地区人民革命武装斗争蓬勃高涨；欧洲、美洲以及其他一些资本主义国家的工人和学生反对美帝国主义和本国反动派的斗争浪潮，给了整个资本主义世界以猛烈的冲击；资本主义世界四十年来未有过的金融危机，严重地动摇了美元在资本主义世界的“霸权”；美国黑人在一百多个城市掀起的抗暴斗争的伟大新风暴，大大震动了美国垄断资本的反动统治。这些事件就象一根又一根套在美帝脖子上的绞索，越拉越紧，使它无法解脱。
    美国垄断资产阶级的两个御用工具民主党和共和党最近为串演总统“选举”丑剧而分别召开的代表大会和其他一些竞选活动就是美帝国主义这种处境的又一证明。尽管两党都耍尽了花招，妄图欺骗人民，争夺总统“宝座”，但是，它们不得不承认，美国对越南的政策，“在军事方面、政治方面、外交方面……都失败了”，“犯了严重的错误”；在国内，面对汹涌澎湃的人民斗争，它们哀叹，美国是一个“陷于分裂的国家”。它们的竞选纲领都无法为到处碰壁、危机四伏的美国内外政策开出一个救命的药方。正是在这种情况下，这两个资产阶级政党，正越来越抛弃为欺骗人民而披上的漂亮外衣，撕掉表示两党有“区别”的假面具，而争相鼓吹在国内外加紧推行反革命两手政策。
    美国垄断资产阶级的竞选丑剧表明，在对外政策方面，失败越来越惨重的美国侵越战争是它们争吵的中心。两党的谋臣策士、政客党棍围绕这个问题时而唱和时而攻讦，都想为美国统治集团寻找一条摆脱困境的出路。但是，不管是民主党的“体面的、持久的解决”也好，共和党的“公正、平等的解决”也好，归根结底都无非是想用战、“和”反革命两手来威胁诱骗英勇的越南人民放下武器、屈膝投降。尽人皆知，战、
  “和”反革命两手策略早已不是什么新鲜玩意儿。美帝国主义一直在苏修叛徒集团的密切配合下对越南人民使用战、“和”反革命两手策略，妄图从“谈判”桌上捞到战场上无法取得的东西，同时又在“和谈”的烟幕掩盖下更加疯狂地推行侵越战争。但是他们非但挽救不了美帝的失败，反而使美帝在侵越战争的泥潭中愈陷愈深、不能自拔。现在，民主党和共和党都死抱住这个破烂货不放，当作救命草，这恰恰反映了美帝国主义这个庞然大物黔驴技穷、一筹莫展的处境。
    在国内问题上，不断高涨的美国黑人争取自由和平等权利的斗争，使美国垄断资产阶级心惊胆战。共和党大叫大嚷要维护代表垄断资本利益的“法律”和“秩序”，“决不容许暴力行为”；民主党则保证要作“巨大的、持续的努力来对付无法无天的举动”。另一方面，两党都开了一大堆空头支票，什么消除种族歧视、改建贫民窟、增加就业等等，妄图达到从政治上欺骗人民的目的。但是，无论是穷凶极恶的镇压，还是花言巧语的欺骗，都扑灭不了美国黑人争取解放的斗争的烈火，相反，只会进一步提高黑人的政治觉悟，促进斗争的发展。
    这次竞选丑剧还表明，觉醒中的美国人民正日益识破资产阶级“选举”的虚伪性和美国所谓“两党制”的反动本质。他们认识到，美国统治集团一手导演的这种“选举”丑剧，只不过是为了维护其反动统治而制造的一种欺骗人民的政治骗局，无论当选民主党总统候选人的汉弗莱，还是当选共和党总统候选人的尼克松，都不过是垄断资产阶级的代理人。美国人民对两党的竞选不仅表示冷淡和不满，而且采取强有力的行动来抗议它们的反动政策。尽管在共和党代表大会期间迈阿密市警戒森严，那里还是爆发了黑人抗暴斗争和反对侵越战争的示威。民主党在芝加哥开会时更是在会场周围密布铁丝网，并动员了二万六千多名法西斯军警镇压人民，但是，在大会期间，仍然有大批大批的群众昼夜不停地举行反对侵越政策的示威。最大的一次示威，参加者达一万数千人之多。他们冲进大会总部所在的旅馆，同警察进行了激烈的搏斗。
    美帝的头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团在美国资产阶级政客们大演竞选丑剧期间，向美国统治集团频送秋波，为美苏进一步勾结创造条件。它们最近同两党的头目勾勾搭搭，帮助美国垄断资产阶级欺骗群众，捞取政治资本，而民主党和共和党在竞选中也十分重视同苏修的进一步勾结。共和党头子尼克松在共和党代表大会前夕表示要访问苏联，民主党头子约翰逊也不甘落后，也打算访问苏联，双方都尽力施展伎俩，拉拢苏修这个最大的帮凶和走狗。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”美帝国主义已经日薄西山，而世界人民的革命斗争正汹涌澎湃，蓬勃高涨。无论美国垄断资产阶级把哪一个党、哪一个人送进白宫，都扭转不了美帝国主义最后走向灭亡的命运。
