Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committees Promote the Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought

Promote Mao Zedong's Advocacy of Theoretical Practice and Unconditionally Implement Chairman Mao's Series of New Directives

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee clearly instructs all levels of revolutionary committees that studying Mao Zedong Thought must focus on the "use" aspect, and it is essential to uphold, spread, and pass on the revolutionary learning style.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 25th - Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committees have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting, spreading, and passing on the revolutionary learning style, and driving the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought across the province to continuously deepen. The broad revolutionary masses further carry forward the great leader Chairman Mao's advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, unconditionally implementing every directive of Chairman Mao, resolutely executing every battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and driving the revolution and production to continuous victories. Currently, the revolutionary people of the entire province are vigorously launching a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

One year ago, Chairman Mao, during his inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the North China, Central China, and East China regions, issued a great call to establish study classes. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, Jiangxi Province quickly and extensively established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee clearly instructed all levels of revolutionary committees that studying Mao Zedong Thought must focus on the "use" aspect and must uphold, spread, and pass on the revolutionary learning style as important measures for running the study classes well.

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee also held two large-scale conferences to exchange experiences on upholding the revolutionary learning style, spreading advanced experiences, and proposing that whether the learning style is upright should be used as a criterion to evaluate the success of each study class. Under the leadership of all levels of revolutionary committees, by now, the province has organized over 600,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 28 million participants. The broad revolutionary masses generally reflect that each time they attend a study class, it is a great learning, training, and test of the revolutionary learning style. Through studying in the classes, the consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses to execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has been greatly enhanced. They follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, and have achieved one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To uphold the revolutionary learning style, the members of various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi Province have taken the lead, insisting on the method of one level leading the next, leaders leading the cadres, and cadres leading the masses. From the beginning, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee led all county-level and above revolutionary committee leaders to gather in the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan to attend Mao Zedong Thought study classes, learning from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and the tradition of the Jinggangshan people following Chairman Mao closely, tempering their hearts to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Through the study, the leading members deeply felt that every victory of the Chinese revolution is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory of revolutionary predecessors closely following Chairman Mao and resolutely executing Chairman Mao's directives. To be a true good cadre loyal to Chairman Mao, the greatest responsibility is to carry on the glorious tradition of revolutionary predecessors, inherit this tradition, and forever carry it forward. Under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the entire province has seen a great atmosphere of swiftly implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives and meticulously upholding the revolutionary learning style.

Just when the revolutionaries were developing and consolidating the great alliance, only a few cities and counties such as Jingdezhen, Yushan, and Yudan had not yet united their two factions. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately took action, organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing revolutionary masses to criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directives, and exposing the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies. Within a few days, the "internal war" big-character posters in these places were swept away, and the two factions quickly achieved revolutionary unity.

After Chairman Mao issued the great directive that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the struggle against the enemy in the entire province rapidly developed in depth. At this time, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to face their doom, stirred up a rightist reversal wind from the dark corners, directing their spears at the newly born revolutionary committees, attempting to overthrow the proletarian revolutionary regime. As soon as this counter-revolutionary current appeared in the Nanchang area, the leading members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees immediately went to the front line of class struggle, personally helping the grassroots revolutionary committees to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the masses, using class struggle as the key link and Chairman Mao's latest directives as weapons, guiding the revolutionary masses to combine theory with practice, analyze the new characteristics and trends of class struggle, quickly expose the hidden class enemies, and smash the evil plots of class enemies attempting counter-revolutionary restoration.

In the first half of this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized a "three-in-one" agricultural support army of 200,000 people, including the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students, who, after training, went to the vast rural areas of the entire province. After arriving in the countryside, their first task was to help organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, closely combining with the reality of class struggle, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They worked with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to actively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, further exposing the cover of class struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, and launching a new high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production. The class struggle in the rural areas of Shangrao Prefecture has always been very sharp. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists stirred up evil winds and ghost fires, advocating disbanding teams and individual farming, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist collective economy. The agricultural support army, relying closely on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle with the poor and lower-middle peasants, combining theory with practice, and thoroughly exposing the enemy situation. They, with deep hatred towards the class enemies, launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, smashed the enemies' plots, and made the entire area's revolution and production present a great situation. Many poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is a revolutionary treasure that cannot be parted with for a moment; the revolutionary learning style is a beacon, and only by studying and applying it can one see the direction clearly.

The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has always attached great importance to organizing representatives of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants to go to various places to teach the revolutionary learning style. The working class and poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian thoughts, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought the best, and have the most upright learning style.

Representative teams composed of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought have gone to various study classes across the province to share their experiences, deeply educating the broad revolutionary masses. Recently, various places across the province have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, selecting outstanding workers to form hundreds of worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering schools and other superstructure fields, leading the educational revolution and struggle, criticism, and transformation. Wherever they go, they organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, serving both as Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and as teams teaching the revolutionary learning style. They have promoted these units to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest directives and have achieved remarkable results.

    江西省各级革委会大办学习班推动活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动深入发展
    发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的好学风  不折不扣地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示
    省革命委员会向各级革命委员会明确提出，学习毛泽东思想一定要在“用”字上狠下功夫，必须带好革命学风，交好革命学风，传好革命学风
    新华社南昌二十五日电　江西省各级革命委员会通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，带革命学风、交革命学风、传革命学风，推动全省活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动不断深入发展。广大革命人民群众进一步发扬伟大领袖毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，不折不扣地落实毛主席的每一个指示，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，推动革命和生产不断胜利发展。目前，全省革命人民正意气风发地掀起伟大的斗、批、改高潮，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    一年以前，毛主席在视察华北、中南、华东地区无产阶级文化大革命的情况时，发出了关于办学习班的伟大号召。遵照毛主席的这一教导，江西全省迅速普遍地办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。江西省革命委员会十分明确地向各级革命委员会提出，学习毛泽东思想一定要在“用”字上狠下功夫，必须把带革命学风，交革命学风，传革命学风，作为办好学习班的重要措施。
    省革委会还先后两次召开大立革命学风的经验交流大会，传播先进经验，并且提出把学风是否正派，作为检验每期学习班办得是否好的标准。在各级革命委员会的领导下，到目前，全省已经办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六十多万期，参加学习的达二千八百多万人次。全省广大革命群众普遍反映，每进一次学习班，都是一次革命学风的大学习，大锻炼，大考验。通过在学习班学习，大大提高了广大革命群众执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极落实毛主席的最新指示，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    为了带好革命学风，江西省各级革委会的成员，以身作则，坚持实行一级带一级、领导带骨干、骨干带群众的办法。省革委会一开始就带领全省县以上的革委会领导成员，集中到革命摇篮井冈山举办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，学习井冈山人民紧跟毛主席的光荣传统，锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。通过学习，使领导成员们更深切地体会到，中国革命的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都是革命前辈紧跟毛主席，坚决执行毛主席指示的胜利。要做一个真正忠于毛主席的好干部，最大的责任，就是接过革命前辈的光荣传统，继承这个传统，永远发扬这个传统。在省革委会的带领下，全省上下出现了雷厉风行地落实毛主席最新指示，一丝不苟地抓革命学风的大好风气。
    正当发展和巩固革命大联合的时候，全省只有景德镇、玉山、余干等几个市、县两派群众组织，仍然联合不起来。省革委会就一竿子插到底，大办毛泽东思想学习班，发动革命群众斗私批修，坚决落实毛主席的指示，揭露一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动。几天之内，这些地方的“内战”大字报一扫而光，两派群众迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    毛主席发出“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的伟大指示以后，全省对敌斗争迅猛向纵深发展。就在这时，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心自己的灭亡，从阴暗角落里刮起一股右倾翻案妖风，把矛头指向新生的革命委员会，妄图颠覆无产阶级革命政权。这股反革命逆流在南昌地区一出现，省、市革命委员会领导成员立即深入到阶级斗争第一线，亲自帮助各基层革委会领导群众办起毛泽东思想学习班，以阶级斗争为纲，以毛主席最新指示为武器，引导革命群众联系实际，分析阶级斗争的新特点、新动向，很快揪出了隐藏的阶级敌人，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图进行反革命复辟的罪恶阴谋。
    今年上半年，江西省革委会组织了有人民解放军、革命干部、革命师生二十万人参加的“三结合”支农大军，经过整训，到了全省广大农村。他们到农村以后，第一个任务就是帮助大办毛泽东思想学习班，紧密联系阶级斗争实际，活学活用毛泽东思想。他们同广大贫下中农一道，积极落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，进一步揭开了农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。上饶专区农村阶级斗争一直十分尖锐，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，煽阴风，点鬼火，闹拆队，闹单干，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏社会主义集体经济。支农大军紧紧依靠广大贫下中农，大办毛泽东思想学习班，同贫下中农一起反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，联系实际，大摆敌情，很快提高了广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，向阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋，使全区革命、生产出现了一派大好形势。许多贫下中农深有体会地说，毛泽东思想是革命的宝，一时一刻离不了；革命学风是明灯，学了就用方向才能看得清。
    江西省革命委员会一直非常重视组织工人阶级和贫下中农的代表，到各地传授革命学风。工人阶级和贫下中农对毛主席的无产阶级感情最深厚，活学活用毛泽东思想最好，学风最正。
    由工人、贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子组成的代表团，分赴全省各地的学习班去传授经验，使广大革命群众受到深刻教育。最近以来，全省各地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，选拔优秀工人组成数百支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻了学校和上层建筑其他领域，领导教育革命和斗、批、改。他们所到之处，大办毛泽东思想学习班，既是毛泽东思想宣传队，又是革命学风的传授队。他们推动这些单位进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，已经取得了显著效果。
