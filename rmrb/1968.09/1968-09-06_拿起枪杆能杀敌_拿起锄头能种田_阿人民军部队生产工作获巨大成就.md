Albanian People's Army Achieves Great Success in Production Work

Every platoon in the People's Army has established a production base; last year, the entire army's production of grain, meat, and vegetables was nearly self-sufficient.

NEW YHUA SOCIETY, TIRANA, Sept. 2 — According to reports from Albanian newspapers, under the guidance of the decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian People's Army has achieved great success in production work, with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm.

Recently, the Albanian People's Army held a conference of production activists. The conference pointed out that many production units under the People's Army have completed and overfulfilled the production tasks for the first two and a half years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970). Now, every platoon in the Albanian People's Army has established an agricultural production base.

In 1967, the entire army's production of grain, meat, and vegetables almost completely met its own needs.

In response to the Party of Labor's call to "go to the hills and mountains, beautify the hills and mountains, and make them as rich as the plains," the mountainous areas of Hystavica and Gjarpëri in Albania have, through the People's Army's reclamation and hard work, become agricultural production bases.

The conference believed that to complete and overfulfill the 1968 and Fourth Five-Year Plan industrial and agricultural production tasks, the People's Army must first, under the guidance of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, strengthen political and ideological work among all cadres and soldiers, and better carry out the work of educating people.

The conference also discussed issues such as the mass line in the leadership of the army's industrial and agricultural production, caring for the lives of the masses, and the revolutionization of scientific research work.

    拿起枪杆能杀敌　拿起锄头能种田
    阿人民军部队生产工作获巨大成就
    人民军每一连队都建立生产基地　去年全军生产的粮食肉类蔬菜接近自给自足
    新华社地拉那二日电　据阿尔巴尼亚报纸报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民军在劳动党第五次代表大会决议和霍查同志教导的指引下，鼓足革命干劲，在部队生产的工作上取得了巨大成就。
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民军召开了部队生产积极分子会议。会议指出，人民军所属的许多生产部门都完成和超额完成了第四个五年计划（一九六六年——一九七○年）头两年半的生产任务。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民军每一个连队都建立了农业生产基地。
    一九六七年，全军生产的粮食、肉类和蔬菜几乎百分之百地满足了自己的需要。
    由于执行劳动党关于“到丘陵和山区去，美化丘陵和山区，使它变得象平原那样富饶”的号召，阿尔巴尼亚的希斯塔维齐和吉亚尔佩里等山区在人民军的开荒和辛勤的劳动下，已变成了农业生产基地。
    会议认为，为了完成和超额完成一九六八年和第四个五年计划的工农业生产任务，首先要求人民军以劳动党和霍查同志的教导，加强对全体指战员和企业职工的政治思想工作和更好地进行教育人的工作。
    会议还讨论了部队工农业生产领导中的群众路线和关心群众生活以及科研工作的革命化等问题。
