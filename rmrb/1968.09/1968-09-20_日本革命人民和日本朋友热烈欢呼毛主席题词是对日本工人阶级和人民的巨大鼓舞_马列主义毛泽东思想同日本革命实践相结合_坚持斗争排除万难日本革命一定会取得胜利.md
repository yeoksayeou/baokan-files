Japanese revolutionary people and friends warmly welcome Chairman Mao's inscription as a great inspiration to the Japanese working class and people. The combination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with Japanese revolutionary practice will ensure victory through perseverance and overcoming all difficulties.

The New China News Agency reported on the 19th from Tokyo: Japanese revolutionary people are enthusiastically welcoming the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese worker friends six years ago.

Longjima Yon'ou, one of the leaders of the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Society" in Japan, pointed out that at present, the Japanese revolution is at a crucial moment. The publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription for Japanese worker friends is very timely. Chairman Mao's inscription is of great significance; it has brought great encouragement to the Japanese revolutionary people.

Longjima said, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's important inscription and seriously consider the issues of the Japanese revolution and the establishment of a genuine Marxist-Leninist party. Chairman Mao's inscription has pointed out the direction of victory for the Japanese revolution. He expressed his belief that a revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be born in the fiery struggle of the revolution.

Longjima believes that the important task facing the Japanese proletarian revolutionary faction is to seriously combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people and, based on the specific situation in Japan, solve a series of strategic and tactical problems of the Japanese revolution, making the Japanese revolution advance continuously.

Longjima condemned the treacherous acts of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique in betraying Marxism-Leninism and the revolution. He said, the Miyamoto clique serves U.S. imperialism and the Sato government, acting as spies for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and has exposed its true fascist face.

Pigai Izuruo, a member of the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Society," said that at a time when the Japanese revolutionary people are deeply concerned about the direction of the Japanese revolution, Chairman Mao's important inscription for Japanese workers was published: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubted." The publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription is very timely. This shows that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Japanese people and the people of the world.

Pigai said, Chairman Mao has repeatedly spoken out on the anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. Chairman Mao pointed out, "U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation"; and pointed out that the Japanese people unite in an anti-American, patriotic united front, "which is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic struggle."

Pigai said, as long as those who persist in struggle use the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—as their weapon, they will definitely unleash tremendous power. As long as we proceed in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, overcoming all difficulties, we will definitely achieve revolutionary victory.

Pigai said, we believe that in the fiery struggle of the revolution, a genuine revolutionary party in Japan armed with Marxism-Leninism will definitely be born. Under the leadership of this revolutionary party, we will go through a long and tortuous struggle, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and achieve the final victory of the revolution.

Pigai said, combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of revolutions in various countries is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause of the people of various countries. We must adhere to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and at the same time, we must start from actual life, closely connect with the masses, continuously summarize the experience of mass struggles, and propose and implement policies and strategies suitable for our own country.

Pigai emphasized that we must launch a revolutionary criticism of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique. We must draw a clear political, ideological, theoretical, and organizational line with the Miyamoto revisionist clique. We must first smash Miyamoto revisionism; otherwise, we cannot establish Mao Zedong Thought.

Pigai strongly condemned the Miyamoto revisionist clique for betraying the revolution and pushing the reactionary line of serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Pigai said, the Miyamoto revisionist clique has become the favorite of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, playing a role that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries cannot play.

Pigai emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. The struggle practices of the people in Japan and various places in the world have proven that as long as we proceed in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely achieve victory.

Pigai expressed his belief that the broad masses of the Japanese people, including those temporarily deceived by the Miyamoto revisionist clique, will one day rise up in revolution.

The New China News Agency reported on the 19th that according to the Oriental News Agency, Japanese friends enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese worker friends six years ago, praising this important inscription for clearly pointing out the road to victory for the Japanese revolution, which is a great encouragement to the Japanese working class and revolutionary people.

Japanese labor movement leader Ken'uta Kanda delivered a speech, enthusiastically welcoming the publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription. He said: The struggle of the Japanese people to smash the U.S.-Japan "security" system and strive for national independence is a continuous and vigorous revolutionary struggle. Only by combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution can the Japanese revolution achieve victory. We must clearly adhere to the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, and at the same time, we must start from the actual situation, closely connect with the people, summarize the experience of revolutionary mass struggles, and formulate and implement policies and strategies suitable for the situation in Japan. Ken'uta emphasized that at present, it is especially necessary to fight against the danger of revisionism because the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, although verbally opposes the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," actually extinguishes the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. He also strongly condemned the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique for obstructing the progress of the labor movement, bringing trade unionism and economism into the Japanese labor movement.

Ken'uta said, the broad masses of Japanese workers urgently hope for a revolution and sincerely hope for the birth of a genuine revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and closely connected with the masses. He finally said, "We must bravely throw ourselves into the fiery struggle of the revolution, making theory and practice combine."

A progressive friend from Hokkaido, Kohara Kazuichi, said: "Chairman Mao's inscription for Japanese worker friends is concise in language but contains the deepest and richest teachings. Those who are truly dedicated to the Japanese revolution must never forget this teaching at any time." He said, "We must adhere to the great universal principles of Marxism-Leninism and the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, we must throw ourselves into the actual life and actual struggles of the Japanese working class and the masses, striving to combine the two. For the Japanese revolutionary faction, this is an honorable and arduous task."

He pointed out: Now, the broad masses of the Japanese people are launching an anti-American, patriotic struggle, and the Japanese proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary people are opposing the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, and the situation is very good. Under such circumstances, those who are truly dedicated to the revolution must throw themselves into the fiery mass struggle, temper themselves, and wage an uncompromising struggle against all bourgeois and revisionist ideologies, and strive to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with practical struggles to strive for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

    新华社十九日讯　东京消息：日本革命人民热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席六年前给日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表。
    日本“毛泽东思想研究会”负责人之一长岛又男指出，在当前，日本革命处在重要的关键时刻，毛主席给日本工人朋友们的重要题词发表了，这是非常及时的。毛主席的题词具有极为重要的意义，它给日本革命人民带来了巨大鼓舞。
    长岛说，我们必须努力学习毛主席的重要题词，认真地考虑日本革命和建立真正的马克思列宁主义政党的问题。毛主席的题词给日本革命指出了胜利的航向。他表示相信，一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的革命党，一定会在革命斗争的烈火中诞生。
    长岛认为，日本无产阶级革命派面临的重要任务，就是认真地把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同日本人民的革命斗争的具体实践相结合，并从日本的具体情况出发，解决日本革命的一系列战略和战术问题，使日本革命不断前进。
    长岛谴责日共宫本修正主义集团背叛马克思列宁主义、背叛革命的罪行。他说，宫本集团为美帝国主义和佐藤政府效劳，充当美日反动派的奸细，并且暴露了它的社会法西斯主义的真面目。
    “毛泽东思想研究会”的成员井出润一郎说，正当日本革命人民都深切地关心日本革命的航向时，发表了毛主席给日本工人们的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”毛主席的重要题词的发表，是非常切合时宜的。这表明，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是日本人民和世界人民的伟大领袖。
    井出说，毛主席过去就日本人民的反美爱国斗争多次地发表谈话。毛主席指出，“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人”；并指出，日本人民结成反美爱国统一战线，“是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”
    井出说，只要坚持斗争的人们以当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想为武器，就一定会发挥出巨大的力量。只要我们按照毛主席指出的方向，排除万难前进，就一定能取得革命的胜利。
    井出说，我们相信，在革命斗争的烈火中，日本的用马克思列宁主义武装起来的真正的革命政党一定会诞生。在这个革命政党的领导下，我们将经过长期的曲折斗争，战胜一切艰难和险阻，取得革命的最后胜利。
    井出说，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与各国革命的具体实践相结合，这是各国人民的革命事业取得胜利的根本保证。我们必须坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，同时必须从实际生活出发，紧密联系群众，不断地总结群众斗争的经验，提出和实行适合于本国的政策和策略。
    井出强调说，我们必须对日共宫本修正主义集团展开革命的大批判。我们必须同宫本修正主义集团，在政治上、思想上、理论上、组织上彻底划清界限。我们必须首先大破宫本修正主义，否则就不能树立毛泽东思想。
    井出强烈谴责宫本修正主义集团背叛革命，推行为美日反动派效劳的反革命路线的罪恶行径。井出说，宫本修正主义集团已经成为美日反动派的宠儿，它起着美日反动派起不到的作用。
    井出强调说，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，日本和世界各地人民的斗争实践证明，只要我们沿着毛主席指出的方向前进，就一定会取得胜利。
    井出表示相信，广大日本人民，包括那些暂时受宫本修正主义集团蒙蔽的人，总有一天会起来革命的。
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本朋友热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席六年前给日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表，盛赞这一重要题词明确地指出了日本革命胜利的道路，对于日本工人阶级和革命人民是极大的鼓舞。
    日本工人运动领导人兼田富太郎发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席重要题词的发表。他说：日本人民粉碎日美“安全”体系和争取民族独立的斗争是持续不断的和生气蓬勃的革命斗争。只有把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本的革命才能取得胜利。我们必须明确地坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，同时必须从实际情况出发，密切联系人民群众，总结革命群众斗争的经验，制订和实行符合日本情况的政策和策略。兼田强调指出，目前特别要同修正主义的危险作斗争，因为日共宫本修正主义集团虽然在口头上反对日美“安全条约”，但是在实际上却扑灭日本人民的革命斗争。他还强烈谴责日共宫本修正主义集团阻挠劳工运动的前进，把工联主义和经济主义带到日本工人运动中去。
    兼田说，广大日本工人群众迫切地希望革命，真诚地希望一个用马克思列宁主义武装起来的、紧密联系群众的真正的革命政党的诞生。他最后说：“我们要英勇地投入革命斗争的烈火中去，使理论与实践相结合。”
    一位北海道的进步朋友大河原孝一说：“毛主席给日本工人朋友们的题词，词句简洁，包含着最深刻、最丰富的教益。真正致力于日本革命的人们任何时候都不能忘记这个教导。”他说：“我们必须坚持伟大的马克思列宁主义的普遍原则和当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，同时必须投身到日本的实际生活以及日本工人阶级和人民群众的实际斗争中去，努力把两者结合起来。对于日本革命派来说，这是一项光荣而艰巨的任务。”
    他指出：现在，日本广大人民，正在开展反美爱国斗争，日本的无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民正在造日共宫本修正主义集团的反，形势一片大好。在这种情况下，真正致力于革命的人们必须投身到火热的群众斗争中去，锻炼自己，同一切资产阶级和修正主义思想作不调和的斗争，并努力把马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想同斗争实践结合起来，去争取日本革命的胜利。
