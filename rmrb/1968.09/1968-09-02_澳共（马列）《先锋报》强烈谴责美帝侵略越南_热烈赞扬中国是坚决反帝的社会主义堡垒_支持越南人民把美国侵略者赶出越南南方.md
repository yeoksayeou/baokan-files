The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ "Vanguard" published an article on August 22, warmly praising the Chinese people's resolute stand against imperialism under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. It strongly condemned U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and supported the Vietnamese people in driving the U.S. aggressors out of South Vietnam.

The article pointed out that on the battlefield in South Vietnam, the initiative is firmly in the hands of the South Vietnamese people and their armed forces. The fact that the U.S. imperialists are escalating the Vietnam War proves their failure.

The article continued: Today, hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising up against imperialism, driving imperialism off their lands. We are living in an era where imperialism is heading towards final defeat and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Imperialism is bound to fail globally because hundreds of millions of people are rising up and acting according to the extremely wise thoughts put forward by the great leader Mao Zedong.

The article said: Chairman Mao's summary of the experience of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism is a weapon for the struggle of revolutionary people all over the world. Mao Zedong's theory is the guiding light for the world revolutionary movement because these theories have been tested by practice and proven correct.

The article said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China is today the most important force in the world. The Chinese people are resolute and unyielding in their struggle against imperialism. China is a socialist stronghold against imperialism, inspiring the world's people to fight against imperialism. The article pointed out that the fact that U.S. imperialists are constantly shouting "peace" proves beyond doubt that they are being defeated. The victory of the people's war in South Vietnam forces the United States to play deceitful tricks.

The article pointed out that although imperialists face inevitable defeat, they will not lay down their arms voluntarily and must be thoroughly defeated. The article emphasized that imperialists must be resolutely defeated. The people of South Vietnam have set a good example in this regard.

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》强烈谴责美帝侵略越南
    热烈赞扬中国是坚决反帝的社会主义堡垒
    支持越南人民把美国侵略者赶出越南南方
    据新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》八月二十二日发表文章，热烈赞扬在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中国人民坚决反对帝国主义的立场，强烈谴责美帝侵略越南，支持越南人民把美国侵略者统统从越南南方赶出去。
    文章指出，在南越战场上，主动权牢牢地掌握在南越人民和他们的武装力量手中。美帝搞侵越战争“升级”的事实本身就证明了美帝的失败。
    文章接着说：今天，亿万亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民起来反对帝国主义，把帝国主义从他们的土地上赶出去。我们生活在帝国主义走向最后失败，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。帝国主义就要在世界范围内失败，因为亿万人民正在按照伟大领袖毛泽东十分英明地提出的思想行动起来。
    文章说：毛主席对中国人民反帝斗争经验的总结是全世界革命人民斗争的武器。毛主席的理论是世界革命运动的指路明灯，因为这些理论经过实践的检验，证明是正确的。
    文章说：在毛主席领导下的中国是今天世界上最重要的力量。中国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中是坚决的，不屈不挠的。中国是反对帝国主义的社会主义堡垒，它鼓舞了世界人民进行反对帝国主义的斗争。文章指出，美帝国主义者现在不断叫喊“和平”这一事实，无可争辩地证明，它们正在被打败。越南南方人民战争的胜利迫使美国玩弄口是心非的把戏。
    文章指出，帝国主义者尽管面临不可避免的失败，它们仍然不会自动放下武器，必须把他们彻底打败。文章强调说，必须坚决地击败帝国主义者。越南南方人民在这方面作出了良好的榜样。
