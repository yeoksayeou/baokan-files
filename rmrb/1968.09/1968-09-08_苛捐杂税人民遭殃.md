The Mobutu group, in order to raise funds for suppressing the people and to satisfy their own extravagance, while begging for handouts from their American masters, have intensified their exploitation and extortion of the people. They have imposed various forms of heavy taxes and levies. In addition to forcing people to participate in insurance schemes, they also compel all citizens to purchase party membership cards and badges for the so-called "People's Revolutionary Movement" concocted by Mobutu to maintain his reactionary rule. Without these, people cannot move freely. Even newborn babies must have party membership cards before they can be registered. Now, the people of Zaire call this "People's Revolutionary Movement" the "Big Landlord Movement."

    苛捐杂税人民遭殃
    蒙博托集团为了筹集镇压人民的经费和供他们自己的挥霍，在向美国主子乞求施舍的同时，加紧对人民进行搜刮勒索。他们规定下了各种名目的苛捐杂税，如除了强迫人民参加保险外，还强迫所有的老百姓购买蒙博托为维持其反动统治而拼凑起来的“人民革命运动”的党证和纪念章，否则就寸步难行。连刚生下的小孩也要先买了党证后才允许进行户口登记。现在刚果（金）人民都把这个祸国殃民的“人民革命运动”叫做“大财主运动”。
