The second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference concluded successfully, ensuring that Chairman Mao's proletarian military line is firmly rooted at the grassroots level. The conference emphasized raising the awareness of line struggle and deepening the "Four Good" regiment movement.

The representatives further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's military line and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions regarding the "Four Good" regiment movement. They recognized that political and ideological excellence is the guiding principle, the overall situation, and the primary focus, while the other three aspects (military training, living conditions, and work style) are secondary. It is not possible to use military affairs to overshadow political and ideological work, nor can political and ideological excellence be placed on the same level as the other three aspects. Instead, it is necessary to emphasize proletarian politics as the center, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, to promote the ideological revolutionization of the people. Once political and ideological work is done well, the other three aspects will naturally improve, leading to overall progress.

New China News Agency, September 3rd: In the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the close unity of the people and the military around Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, the second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference, which focused on further implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and strengthening grassroots construction, was successfully concluded in Beijing.

During the conference, our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the leaders of the Central Committee and the Cultural Revolution Group, received all the representatives. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, and education that Chairman Mao has shown for the navy and the entire military.

The second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference firmly grasped the key issue of the struggle between the two military lines. Through listening to reports, discussions, studying the history of our military's construction, visiting exhibitions on the struggle between the two military lines, and introducing advanced examples of "Four Good" regiments, the conference highly praised the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's military line and thoroughly exposed the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary military line. The representatives, based on their personal experiences, deeply felt that the deeper the roots of Chairman Mao's military line are planted at the grassroots level, the stronger the combat effectiveness of the troops will be; by advancing bravely along Chairman Mao's military line, our military will forever be invincible.

The second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference adopted a combination of large, medium, and small meetings to widely exchange experiences in carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement. The conference further clarified the significant strategic importance of continuing to deepen the "Four Good" regiment movement in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The conference believed that the troops, through the severe tests of class struggle, line struggle, and the struggle between the two roads during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have developed the "Four Good" regiment movement to a new level. However, some comrades' understanding of strengthening grassroots construction and carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement has not kept up with the needs of the developing situation. The representatives repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's and Comrade Lin Biao's important instructions on strengthening grassroots construction, significantly raising their awareness. Chairman Mao, as early as the initial period of the Red Army's construction, taught us: "The Red Army has been able to fight bravely and not disintegrate, and 'the party branch is established at the company level' is an important reason." Comrade Lin Biao has always emphasized that "the company is the most important," "is the vanguard in battle," "is the tip of the sword," "is the blade," "must grasp the 'Four Good' and definitely achieve results in the 'Four Good,' and build the company well." Everyone deeply understood that to make Chairman Mao's military line deeply rooted in the troops, it is necessary to firmly grasp grassroots construction; and to grasp grassroots construction, it is necessary to grasp the "Four Good" regiment movement. The military cannot do without grassroots construction, and grassroots construction cannot do without the "Four Good." Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's military thoughts, proposed to carry out the "Four Good" regiment movement, which is a major strategic measure of great significance for the revolutionary construction and war preparedness of our military. By insisting on carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement, Chairman Mao's military line can be firmly rooted at the grassroots level, significantly promoting the ideological and organizational revolutionization of the companies, doing all the work of the troops better, continuously improving the combat effectiveness of the troops, and making our military an invincible great wall. The representatives said that the attitude towards the "Four Good" regiment movement is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line. It is necessary to raise the understanding of carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement to the level of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's military line.

The representatives of the second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference reviewed the seven-year history of carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement and severely criticized the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing in disrupting and interfering with the "Four Good" regiment movement. They deeply understood from a large number of facts that further raising the proletarian political awareness and line struggle awareness of the troops is an important sign of raising the "Four Good" regiment movement to a new level in the new situation, and it is also a powerful driving force for creating the "Four Good" regiment movement in the new situation. The "Four Good" regiment movement was born and developed in the struggle between the two lines. In carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement, there has been a struggle between us and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing in terms of revision and counter-revision, impact and counter-impact, interference and counter-interference. This struggle runs through the entire process of carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement. Only by exposing the various tricks and obstacles of the class enemies can we ensure that the "Four Good" regiment movement develops forward along the correct track of Chairman Mao's military line. The representatives also introduced advanced typical experiences of insisting on creating the "Four Good" in the struggle between the two lines. Everyone further clarified that the higher the line struggle awareness of a unit, the more vigorously the "Four Good" regiment movement will be carried out. The new level of the "Four Good" regiment movement is mainly new in the height of line struggle awareness. To continuously improve the level of the "Four Good" regiment movement, it is necessary to firmly grasp the key of raising line struggle awareness and persevere, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary military line, and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

The representatives of the second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference, based on the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all work, and "to seize the revolution, promote production, work, and war preparedness," seriously studied the issue of correctly handling the relationship between political and ideological excellence and the other three aspects in the new situation of continuing to emphasize proletarian politics. They reviewed the experiences of creating the "Four Good" over the past few years and deeply felt that whether to firmly walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and correctly handle the relationship between political and ideological excellence and the other three aspects is a major issue of whether to create a "Four Good" regiment and fully implement Chairman Mao's military line at the grassroots level. The representatives, through study, further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's military line and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions regarding the "Four Good" regiment movement, recognizing that political and ideological excellence is the guiding principle, the overall situation, and the primary focus, while the other three aspects are secondary. It is not possible to use military affairs to overshadow political and ideological work, nor can political and ideological excellence be placed on the same level as the other three aspects. Instead, it is necessary to emphasize proletarian politics as the center, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, to promote the ideological revolutionization of the people. Once political and ideological work is done well, the other three aspects will naturally improve, leading to overall progress. However, there must be both the overall situation and the specific aspects, both the primary and the secondary. Politics is the guiding principle, but the other three aspects cannot be neglected. By focusing on political and ideological work, the other three aspects can be guided, promoted, and brought along.

Everyone deeply felt: "Using political and ideological excellence to promote and bring along the other three aspects is the true creation of the 'Four Good'; using the three aspects to maintain military training excellence is to damage the 'Four Good'; using political and ideological excellence to replace the other three aspects is to abolish the 'Four Good.' 'Using the three aspects to maintain military training excellence, the more it is maintained, the farther it is from Chairman Mao's military line; using political and ideological excellence to promote and bring along the other three aspects, the more it is promoted and brought along, the more loyal it is to Chairman Mao's military line, the more it is promoted and brought along, the stronger the combat effectiveness of the troops will be."

The representatives of the second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference, based on Comrade Lin Biao's principle of "not changing within change, changing within not changing" and the experiences of creating the "Four Good" regiment movement over the past two years, studied the new content and requirements that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought to the "Four Good" regiment movement. Everyone believed that political and ideological excellence is to be excellent in taking Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is the highest standard of political and ideological excellence and the fundamental purpose of carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement. To achieve this highest standard and fundamental purpose, it is necessary to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promote the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which unifies theory and practice. Regarding Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions, they must be learned and applied in struggle; learned and applied immediately, said and done immediately, learning and application consistent, words and deeds consistent, understood and executed, temporarily not understood but also executed, and deepened understanding through execution. Resolutely oppose the bad learning style of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, which is inconsistent in words and deeds, inconsistent in learning and application, good in words but bad in deeds, hypocritical, and insincere. Deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of all traces of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. The three aspects of work style are good, which means to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, for every new instruction from Chairman Mao, and for every battle order from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, to achieve "transmission without delay, learning without omission, following without lagging, and execution without distortion." Thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center is no center" theory, resolutely resist and overcome the influence and infiltration of reactionary trends such as anarchism. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, unify understanding, steps, and actions, and continuously enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. Military training is good, which means to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary education, seriously implement the policy of "few but excellent," combine revolutionary criticism and struggle, actively and plannedly carry out training reforms, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary military line, use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, and train soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought. Living management is good, which mainly emphasizes that cadres learn to lead soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, requiring cadres to be both "officials" and ordinary soldiers, daring to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat in the troops, and skillfully guide petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, strictly demand, patiently persuade, care for the lives of the masses, and insist on the style of thrift, simplicity, and hard work, resisting the influence of the evil wind of economism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The movement develops, and there are new things ahead. New things are endless. To study the overall situation and its development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to." At the second national navy "Four Good" regiment representative conference, the experiences of the division and brigade-level party committees and organs in firmly grasping the creation of the "Four Good" regiment movement were also introduced. They felt that the company is the starting point and the foothold of the work of the organs. If the company is not solid, it indicates that the organ is not solid. How the "Four Good" regiment movement is carried out is directly related to the leadership of various levels of party committees and organs, especially the leadership of the division and brigade-level party committees and organs. Various levels of party committees and organs must continuously raise their awareness of the importance of carrying out the "Four Good" regiment movement and strengthening grassroots construction, and allocate capable cadres and organize special teams to grasp the work; leading cadres and organ cadres should take turns to go deep into the grassroots and the masses, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, to implement face-to-face leadership, timely discover new problems, continuously study new situations, actively discover new typical examples, and vigorously promote new experiences, so that the "Four Good" regiment movement continues to develop forward.

Comrade Xiao Jingguang, a responsible comrade of the navy, spoke at the conference. Comrade Li Zuopeng made a summary speech titled "Advancing Bravely Along Chairman Mao's Proletarian Military Line and Raising the Creation of the 'Four Good' Regiment Movement in the Navy to a New Level." In the summary speech, Comrade Li Zuopeng enthusiastically praised and publicized Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line, systematically summarized the experiences of the navy in carrying out the creation of the "Four Good" regiment movement over the past seven years, analyzed the new situation and characteristics of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new requirements it has brought to the grassroots construction of the troops, and put forward the task of further seriously learning and mastering Chairman Mao's military line to all the cadres and soldiers of the navy. He called on all the cadres and soldiers of the navy to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to emphasize proletarian politics, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to implement the great program formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao of "to build a strong navy to oppose the aggression of imperialism," to turn the navy into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and to complete all the glorious tasks given by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao. It is necessary to forever advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and raise the creation of the "Four Good" regiment movement in the navy to a new level.

More than a thousand representatives attending the conference, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, passed a letter of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao and a resolution to Comrade Lin Biao, the beloved vice commander-in-chief.

The conference established 14 exemplary "Four Good" regiments. These exemplary regiments are combat collectives that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, taking Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Among them are the certain transport boat squadron that closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and has achieved remarkable results in the "Four Good" regiment movement; the certain torpedo boat squadron that firmly grasps the active thoughts in the struggle between the two lines and continuously raises the line struggle awareness of the troops; the 574 escort boat that firmly implements the policy of "seizing the revolution, promoting production, work, and war preparedness" and has made significant contributions to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the "Sea and Air Eagles" squadron that raises line struggle awareness and has achieved many merits in the struggle against the enemy; the 125 submarine that has made meritorious deeds in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois military line and establish Chairman Mao's military line; and the 82 escort boat that consciously follows and firmly executes the commands and instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao.

    海军第二次四好连队代表大会胜利闭幕
    让毛主席无产阶级建军路线牢牢扎根基层
    提高路线斗争觉悟深入开展四好连队运动
    大会代表进一步加深对毛主席建军路线和林副主席有关四好连队运动指示的理解，认识到政治思想好同其他三好是统帅和被统帅、全局和局部、主和次的关系。不能用军事压倒政治思想工作，也不能把政治思想好同其他三好并列，而必须以突出无产阶级政治为中心，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。政治思想搞好了，其他三好就能带动起来，就一通百通。
    新华社三日讯　在全国亿万军民紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，在北京召开的以进一步贯彻毛主席无产阶级建军路线、大抓基层建设为中心内容的海军第二次四好连队代表大会，已于最近胜利闭幕。
    大会期间，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及中央、中央文革的领导同志接见了全体代表。这是伟大领袖毛主席对海军也是对全军指战员最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的教育。
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会，紧紧抓住两条建军路线斗争这条纲，通过听报告，座谈讨论，学习我军建军历史，参观两条建军路线斗争展览，和介绍四好连队先进事迹等多种多样活动，大赞大颂毛主席建军路线的无比正确，大揭大批资产阶级反动军事路线的滔天罪行。代表们根据自己切身的实践，深有体会地说，毛主席建军路线的根子在基层扎得越深，部队战斗力就越强；沿着毛主席建军路线奋勇前进，我军就永远无敌于天下。
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会，采取大中小会相结合的形式，广泛地交流了开展四好连队运动的经验，进一步明确了在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下继续深入开展四好连队运动的重大战略意义。会议认为，部队在无产阶级文化大革命中，经受了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的严峻考验，使四好连队运动有了新的发展。但是一部分同志对加强基层建设，开展四好连队运动的认识还跟不上形势发展的需要。代表们反复地学习了毛主席和林副主席关于抓基层建设的重要指示，认识大大提高。毛主席早在红军建设初期，就教导我们：“红军所以艰难奋战而不溃散，‘支部建在连上’是一个重要原因。”林副主席也一贯强调，“连队是最重要的”，“是冲锋陷阵的”，“是刀子上的尖，是刀锋”，“要抓住四好不放，一定要把四好搞出成绩来，把连队建设好”。大家深刻地认识到，要使毛主席的建军路线在部队深深扎根，必须狠抓基层建设；而要抓好基层建设，又必须抓四好连队运动。军队不抓基层不行，抓基层不抓四好不行。林副主席根据毛主席建军思想提出的开展四好连队运动，是我军革命化建设和战备工作的一项具有深远意义的重大战略措施。坚持开展四好连队运动，就可以把毛主席的建军路线牢牢扎根在基层，就可以大大促进连队思想革命化和组织革命化，把部队各项工作做得更好，不断提高部队的战斗力，使我军永远成为坚不可摧的伟大长城。代表们说，对待四好连队运动的态度，就是对待毛主席建军路线的态度，要把开展四好连队运动提到贯彻和捍卫毛主席建军路线这个高度来认识。
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会代表，回顾了七年来开展四好连队运动的斗争历史，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿破坏和干扰四好连队运动的滔天罪行。他们从大量的事实中深刻地认识到，进一步提高部队的无产阶级政治觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，是在新形势下把创造四好连队运动提高到新水平的重要标志，又是在新形势下创造四好连队运动的强大动力。四好连队运动是在两条路线斗争中产生和发展起来的。在开展四好连队运动中，我们同反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿之间存在着篡改和反篡改、冲击和反冲击、干扰和反干扰的斗争。这种斗争贯串在开展四好连队运动的全部过程。只有识破阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，打破他们的重重阻挠，才能保证四好连队运动沿着毛主席建军路线的正确轨道胜利地向前发展。代表们还介绍了在两条路线斗争中坚持创造四好的先进典型经验。大家进一步明确了，那一个单位路线斗争觉悟高，那一个单位的四好连队运动就开展得蓬蓬勃勃。四好连队运动的新水平，主要的就是新在路线斗争觉悟的高度上。要不断提高四好连队运动的水平，就一定要抓住提高路线斗争觉悟这个关键不放、一抓到底，大破资产阶级反动军事路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会代表，根据伟大领袖毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线和“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大教导，认真研究了在新形势下继续突出无产阶级政治，正确处理政治思想好同其他三好的关系问题。他们回顾了几年来创四好的经验，深深感到，能否坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，正确地认识和处理政治思想好同其他三好的关系，这是能否创造四好连队，使毛主席的建军路线在基层全面落实的大问题。代表们通过学习进一步加深了对毛主席建军路线和林副主席有关四好连队运动指示的理解，认识到政治思想好同其他三好是统帅和被统帅、全局和局部、主和次的关系。不能用军事压倒政治思想工作，也不能把政治思想好同其他三好并列，而必须以突出无产阶级政治为中心，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。政治思想搞好了，其他三好就能带动起来，就一通百通。但是，有全局也要有局部，有主也要有次。政治是挂帅的，但其他三好也不能丢。抓好了政治思想工作，不等于把其他三好都抓好了。在着重抓政治思想的前提下，对三八作风、军事训练和生活管理也要抓。要用政治思想好去统帅、促进和带动其他三好。
    大家深有体会地说：“以政治思想好促进和带动其他三好，是真正的创四好；以三好保军事训练好，是损坏四好；以政治思想好代替其他三好，是取消四好。”“以三好保军事训练好，越保离毛主席的建军路线越远，以政治思想好促进和带动其他三好，越促进越带动就对毛主席的建军路线越忠，越促进越带动就使部队战斗力越强。”
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会代表根据林副主席对抓根本性东西要“不变中有变，变中有不变”的原则和近两年来创造四好连队运动的经验，研究了无产阶级文化大革命的新形势给四好连队运动提出的新内容、新要求。大家认为，政治思想好，就是要好在以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线上。这是政治思想好的最高标准，也是开展四好连队运动的根本目的。要实现这个最高标准和根本目的，必须活学活用毛泽东思想，大兴毛主席倡导的理论和实践统一的革命学风。对毛主席著作和最新指示，要在斗争中学，在斗争中用；学了就用，说了就做，学用一致，言行一致，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行中加深理解。坚决反对那种言行不一，学用脱节，嘴上说得好、实际做得糟，对人不对己，甚至阳奉阴违，口是心非的资产阶级、修正主义的坏学风。要深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒和影响。三八作风好，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对毛主席的每一个最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一战斗号令，要做到“传达不过夜，学习不漏人，紧跟不掉队，执行不走样”。要彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，坚决抵制和克服无政府主义等反动思潮的影响和侵蚀。要在毛泽东思想基础上统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，不断增强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。军事训练好，就是要坚决执行毛主席关于教育要革命的指示，认真贯彻“少而精”的方针，结合革命大批判，积极而有计划地进行训练改革，彻底肃清资产阶级反动军事路线的影响，以毛泽东思想为指针，以毛主席著作为基本教材，用毛泽东思想练好兵。生活管理好，最主要的是强调干部学会用毛泽东思想带好兵，要求干部既当“官”，又当普通一兵，对部队既敢于发扬无产阶级革命精神，又善于把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，既严格要求，又耐心说服，既关心群众的生活，又坚持勤俭节约艰苦朴素的作风，抵制经济主义妖风的影响。
    毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”在海军第二次四好连队代表大会上，还介绍了师团两级党委和机关狠抓部队创造四好连队运动的经验。他们体会到，连队是机关工作的出发点和落脚点。连队不过硬，说明机关不过硬。四好连队运动开展得如何，同各级党委和机关的领导、特别是同师团两级党委和机关的领导有着直接的关系。各级党委和机关要不断提高对开展四好连队运动、加强基层建设重要性的认识，并分配得力干部、组织专门班子去抓；领导干部和机关干部要轮流深入基层，深入群众，以毛泽东思想为指针，实行面对面的领导，及时发现新问题，不断研究新情况，积极发现新典型，大力推广新经验，使四好连队运动始终向前发展。
    海军负责人萧劲光同志在大会上讲了话，李作鹏同志在大会上作了题为《沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进，把海军创造四好连队运动提高到新的水平》的总结讲话。李作鹏同志在总结讲话中，热情地歌颂和宣传了毛主席的军事思想和建军路线，系统地总结了七年来海军开展创造四好连队运动的经验，分析了无产阶级文化大革命的新形势、新特点及其对部队基层建设提出的新要求，向海军全体指战员提出了进一步认真学习和掌握毛主席建军路线的任务。他号召海军全体指战员要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为了实现伟大领袖毛主席制定的“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”的伟大纲领，为了把海军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，为了完成以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部交给我们的一切光荣任务，必须永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进，把海军创造四好连队运动提高到新的水平。
    出席大会的一千多名代表，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬信，通过了给敬爱的副统帅林副主席的决心书。
    大会树立了十四个四好连队的标兵。这些标兵都是在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体。其中有紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、在四好连队运动中获得显著成绩的某运输艇中队；有狠抓两条路线斗争中的活思想、不断提高部队路线斗争觉悟的某鱼雷艇部队三中队；有坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的方针、在保卫无产阶级文化大革命中作出重大贡献的五七四护卫艇；有提高路线斗争觉悟、在对敌斗争中屡立战功的“海空雄鹰团”二大队；有在大破资产阶级军事路线、大立毛主席建军路线的斗争中立有功绩的一二五潜艇；有自觉紧跟、坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的命令和指示的八二号护卫艇。
