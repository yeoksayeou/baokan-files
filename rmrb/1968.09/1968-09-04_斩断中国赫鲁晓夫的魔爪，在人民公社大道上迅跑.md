“Look at the golden waves of rice and millet, heroes everywhere under the evening smoke.” On the tenth anniversary of the people's commune, the poor and lower-middle-class peasants of Beixiaodong Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Guangzong County, Hebei Province, pointing to the fields of crops they had nurtured with their own hands and which were almost ready for harvest, spoke passionately about how good the people's commune is! They vehemently denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev who attempted to destroy the people's commune.

The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants Association, Li Jianjian, posed a question to the group: “Why is it that our brigade’s crops are growing so well this year?”

“That’s easy to explain!” said the sixty-something-year-old poor peasant, He Yunlan, eagerly taking the floor. “It’s all thanks to Chairman Mao’s leadership! It’s because the path of the people's commune is high! It’s because the Cultural Revolution has brought about these achievements, and the poor and lower-middle-class peasants are full of enthusiasm! Since spring, we have resolved to fight against the heavens and the earth, determined to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture. We have successively overcome natural disasters such as wind and drought. Now, we are rallying our spirits, seizing the opportunity, catching moths and collecting eggs, spraying powder and spreading medicine, and effectively controlling the pestilence in the fields. Our hard work has not been in vain, and our sweat has not been shed for nothing; how could we not have a bumper harvest?”

The deputy chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants Association, Zhao Degui, continued: “The crops are growing well this year because we have followed Chairman Mao’s teachings: ‘Learn from Dazhai in agriculture.’ We have long made up our minds to be like the people of Dazhai, relying not on the heavens, not on the earth, but on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We have relied on our own efforts, worked hard, and put in hard work in the struggle to change the heavens and the earth. In the western sandy fields, we dug ditches and built embankments, planted trees to prevent wind; in the eastern large fields, we repaired the land and built roads, improved the soil to prevent waterlogging. Now it is: three hundred mu of sandy land is shaded by green trees, two hundred mu of alkaline land grows good crops. Truly, with spirit and willpower, the land is transformed and renewed!”

The old poor peasant and cadre, Ge Hebin, spoke from experience: “There are many reasons why our rural areas have undergone fundamental changes, a thousand good things, ten thousand good things, but the best thing is that Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us: ‘It is still good to establish people's communes.’ With the people's commune, the poor and lower-middle-class peasants have been further organized, with many people and great strength, overcoming difficulties that could not be overcome in the past. Take pest control for example: in the past, when there were pests, we would catch them by hand, use oil drums to push them, and after all the trouble, the pests would still eat everything. Now it’s different; when pests are found, we all work together, using machines to spray and spreading medicine packets, and the pests are controlled in two days. Moreover, with the people's commune, small plots of land are connected into one piece, making it convenient for machine cultivation. Agriculture is the foundation, industry is the leading factor. With the people's commune, the development of agriculture is guaranteed, which in turn promotes the development of industry. In this way, the leading role of industry becomes more and more obvious, and the leadership and help from the worker comrades also become greater and greater, making the people's commune even more superior. Just take our brigade as an example; in recent years, the worker comrades have sent us fertilizer, pesticides, various agricultural machinery, and new farming tools every year, which have played a significant role in our agricultural production. With the people's commune, production has greatly increased, and accumulation has also greatly increased, putting forward more and more demands on industry. Without the people's commune, these things would be difficult to achieve! The people's commune is the broad path that Chairman Mao has shown us, and we will resolutely follow it and never waver!”

The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants Association, Li Jianjian, further elaborated to the group: “Yes, ‘It is still good to establish people's communes,’ is the bright path to common prosperity that Chairman Mao has shown us poor and lower-middle-class peasants, the road to communism! But why did the Chinese Khrushchev insist on pushing those black goods like ‘three independences and one contract,’ ‘material incentives’ a few years ago, causing chaos in our village?”

The poor peasant, Qiao Shuren, angrily said: “The Chinese Khrushchev is up to no good; his schemes are a soporific for us poor and lower-middle-class peasants, aiming to blind us so that he can destroy the people's commune and restore capitalism!”

When mentioning the few years when the Chinese Khrushchev caused trouble, the poor peasant and old party member, Qiao Jianxu, fumed: “The Chinese Khrushchev has really harmed us poor and lower-middle-class peasants; he completely represents the interests of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, wanting us to suffer twice. We won’t stand for it! We have truly suffered enough in the old society. In 1943, my family of seven, driven by life, fled and starved to death, leaving my father and mother dead, and the five of us siblings, each fleeing for our lives, selling ourselves, and to this day, we siblings are still unknown whether we are alive or dead, leaving me alone. Where was there a way out for the poor in the old society? Later, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party liberated us, and I was able to stand up, marry, have children, and become a family. But after a few good years, the Chinese Khrushchev again blew the black wind of ‘three independences and one contract,’ ‘four freedoms’ in the countryside, intending to destroy the people's commune. If it weren't for Chairman Mao timely pointing out the direction and stopping the black wind of ‘three independences and one contract,’ we poor and lower-middle-class peasants would have faced another disaster. The black wind of the Chinese Khrushchev is truly poisonous; we must resolutely criticize and expose him, and eliminate his influence!”

The poor peasant and cadre, Ge Hebin, excitedly said: “If we were to follow the path of the Chinese Khrushchev, it would indeed be the case of money clumping together, the poor becoming poorer, and the rich becoming richer. In 1960, under the influence of ‘three independences and one contract,’ our brigade contracted sweet potatoes and land to individuals, with a production quota of seven hundred jin per mu, and surplus production belonged to the individual. The rich peasant, Liu Jianfang, had strong labor and complete tools, harvesting fifteen hundred jin per mu; but the poor peasant, Ge Sanbao, had many children and little labor, working hard but to no avail, resulting in a loss of production, and by the time of harvest, there was not enough grain to eat, making the family's life very difficult. Looking at our brigade, in those years of contracting work and production, the collective land's crops had more weeds than seedlings, with only seven or eight ten-thousand jin harvested each year; in these few years, we have criticized the contracting of work and production, highlighted proletarian politics, and every year we harvest more than twenty ten-thousand jin, and this year's crops are even more promising, with a bumper harvest in sight. If the Chinese Khrushchev had eyes, would he dare to slander the collective economy of the people's commune again?!”

The deputy chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants Association, Zhao Degui, said: “The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly claims to be good for us poor and lower-middle-class peasants, but that's all nonsense! In the past few years when he blew the black wind of ‘three independences and one contract,’ the landlords and rich peasants stirred up trouble. In our brigade, the rich peasant, Liu Xiqiu, in those years, took the opportunity to steal the brigade's plows and harrows, hiding the pitchforks, wooden shovels, cow muzzles, and manure baskets, hoping for the collapse of the people's commune. They are not on the same path as us; we must not let them off the hook, or they will pop up and bite us!”

Finally, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants Association, Li Jianjian, said: “We sit here and talk about it, and it is clear: the Chinese Khrushchev is indeed the backer of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and must be overthrown and exposed, severing his claws, and never falling for his tricks again. We must definitely follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao: ‘The people's commune is good,’ and run swiftly on this broad path!”

    斩断中国赫鲁晓夫的魔爪，在人民公社大道上迅跑
    ——河北省广宗县北小东大队贫下中农社员畅谈“人民公社好”！
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”在人民公社十周年的大喜日子里，河北省广宗县城关公社北小东大队贫下中农社员，指着一片片自己亲手培育、快要丰收的庄稼，以无比激动的心情，畅谈“人民公社好”！痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫妄图搞垮人民公社的滔天罪行。
    贫协主任李艮俭向大家提出问题说：“今年咱队庄稼长得这么好，您说为啥？”
    “那还不好说！”六十多岁的贫农老大爷贺云兰抢先发了言：“还不是咱毛主席领导的好！还不是人民公社道路高！还不是文化大革命带来的成果，咱贫下中农干劲大！从春上，咱们就立志与天斗，与地斗，誓夺农业大丰收。咱们接连战胜了风灾、旱灾等一个一个自然灾害。眼下，又鼓足干劲，抓紧时机，捕蛾采卵，喷粉撒药，利利落落地治了谷地里的虫灾。咱们的功夫没白下，咱们的汗水没白流，它还能不丰收？”
    贫协副主任赵德贵接着说：“今年庄稼长相好，也是咱们遵照毛主席的教导：‘农业学大寨’的结果。咱们早就下定了决心，要象大寨人那样不靠天，不靠地，就靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。自力更生，艰苦奋斗，在改天换地的斗争中下了硬功夫。西沙地里挑沟、打埝，育林防风；东大地里修地垫道，改碱防涝。现在是：三百亩沙地绿树成荫真好瞧，二百亩碱地长出好庄苗。真是人有精神斗志高，地换新装改旧貌啊！”
    老贫农、干部葛合彬深有体会地说：“咱农村起了根本变化的原因很多，千条好，万条好，好就好在毛主席给咱指引的‘还是办人民公社好’这个方向上。有了人民公社，咱贫下中农才进一步组织起来，人多力量大，克服了过去克服不了的困难。就拿治虫说吧：过去有了虫，拿手捉，用洋桶推，闹来闹去，到头来还是叫虫子吃个光。现在可不是，发现有了虫，咱们大伙一齐上，机器喷，药包撒，两天就治下去了。再说，有了人民公社，把小片土地连成一片，便于机器耕作。农业为基础，工业为主导。咱们有了人民公社，农业发展有了保证，就又促进了工业的发展，这样，工业的主导作用也就越来越明显，工人老大哥对咱们的领导和帮助也就越来越大，人民公社也就更加优越了。就拿咱们大队来说，这些年来，工人老大哥年年给咱们送来化肥、农药、各种农业机器和新式农具，对咱们农业生产可起了不小的作用。咱们有了人民公社，生产大发展，积累也大增加，对工业也就提出了越来越多的要求。这些，要不是有了人民公社就难办到啦！人民公社是毛主席他老人家给咱指出的一条康庄大道，咱们坚决走下去，绝不动摇！”
    贫协主任李艮俭对大家引深一步说：“对！‘还是办人民公社好’，是毛主席给咱贫下中农指出的一条共同富裕的光明大道，是通向共产主义的道路！可是，中国赫鲁晓夫为什么在前些年硬要搞什么‘三自一包’、‘物质刺激’这些黑货，把咱村闹了个黄昏？”
    贫农社员乔书仁愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋没安好心，他搞的那一套，是给咱贫下中农下的蒙汗药，要把咱的眼睛蒙住，他好搞垮人民公社，复辟资本主义！”
    一提中国赫鲁晓夫闹的那几年，贫农、老党员乔艮须气呼呼地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫可把咱贫下中农害苦了，他完全代表地、富、反、坏、右分子的利益，想叫咱贫下中农吃二遍苦，咱可不答应！旧社会的苦，咱真吃的够够的了。一九四三年，我一家七口人，因生活所迫，逃荒在外，饿死了父亲又饿死了母亲，留下我兄妹五个，为了各逃活命，自卖自身，至今兄妹生死不明，剩下我孤单单一人。旧社会那有咱穷人的活路？后来，毛主席、共产党把我们解放了，我才翻了身，娶了媳妇，有了孩子，成了一家人。可是，好日子没过几年，中国赫鲁晓夫又在农村刮起了‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’的黑风，一心想把人民公社搞垮。要不是毛主席及时指引方向，煞住‘三自一包’的黑风，咱贫下中农眼看又是一场大祸。中国赫鲁晓夫的这股黑风真毒，咱要坚决把他批倒、批臭，肃清流毒！”
    贫农、干部葛合彬激动地说：“要照中国赫鲁晓夫的道路走下去，那真是钱聚疙瘩，穷的更穷，富的更富了。一九六○年在‘三自一包’的影响下，咱大队往下包山药，按人包地，每亩定产七百斤，超产归己。富农分子刘艮方劳力强壮，工具齐全，一亩地收一千五百斤；可是贫农社员葛三保孩子多，劳力少，累死累活地干还是不行，结果倒赔了产，到时粮食不够吃，一家人生活十分困难。再从咱大队来看，那几年经过包工、包产的集体地的庄稼，草比苗高，每年只收七、八万斤；这几年咱们批判了包工、包产，突出了无产阶级政治，年年收二十多万斤，今年的庄稼更是大有希望，丰收在握。如果中国赫鲁晓夫长着眼睛，看他还敢再污蔑人民公社集体经济没有优越性不敢？！”
    贫协副主任赵德贵说：“中国赫鲁晓夫厚着脸皮说是为咱贫下中农好，那全是放屁！前些年他大刮‘三自一包’黑风的时候，地主、富农就兴风作浪。俺队富农分子刘喜奎，那几年就趁机把队里的砘子、耧都偷走，把杈把、木锨、牛笼嘴、粪笊篱都藏起来，一心盼人民公社垮台。他们跟咱走的根本不是一条道，对这些人咱可不能当好鹌鹑抓，一不注意他就钻出头来咬人！”
    最后，贫协主任李艮俭说：“咱们坐在一起这么一念道，清楚看到：中国赫鲁晓夫确实是地、富、反、坏、右分子的总后台，必须把他打倒、批臭，斩断他的魔爪，永远不再上他的当。一定沿着毛主席给指引的方向：‘人民公社好’这条康庄大道迅跑！”
