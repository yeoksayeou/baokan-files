Syrian Head of State Nureddin al-Atassi said at the opening ceremony of the 10th Arab Lawyers Conference held in Damascus on September 4 that: "The resistance in Palestine has proven that people's resistance is the only effective way to reclaim occupied lands. The resistance in Palestine is the core of the Arab people's comprehensive war against Zionism." Atassi said: "The only way for the Arab people to liberate their occupied lands is to mobilize the broad masses of the people to wage a comprehensive war."

Atassi said: "Our people love peace, but will never surrender."

He said that every sincere Arab has the responsibility to support the Palestinian resistance movement and strengthen this struggle.

Atassi pointed out that the Zionists not only want to bring the occupied lands under their control but also want to force the Arabs to completely surrender. Under the pretext of "peace intentions," Israel demands "direct negotiations" with the Arabs and engages in activities through the UN Secretary-General's "envoy" Yarin. But the resistance of the Palestinian people has not only given the Arab defeatists and capitulationists a slap in the face but has also shattered the myth of Israeli superiority.

Atassi said: "The war we are facing is a war of survival." "We must mobilize all the potential of the Arabs for this decisive war." He said that in terms of military strength, Syria has further strengthened its armed forces.

    阿塔西指出人民的抵抗是收复被占领土地的唯一有效途径
    巴勒斯坦人民粉碎了以色列优势的神话
    新华社大马士革电　叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西四日在大马士革召开的第十届阿拉伯律师会议开幕式上发表讲话说：“巴勒斯坦的抵抗已证明，人民的抵抗是收复被占领的土地的唯一有效的途径。巴勒斯坦的抵抗是阿拉伯对犹太复国主义进行全面的人民战争的核心。”阿塔西说：“阿拉伯人民解放他们被占领的土地的唯一道路，是动员广大人民群众进行全面战争。”
    阿塔西说：“我们的人民是爱好和平的，但是决不会投降。”
    他说，每一个真诚的阿拉伯人有责任支持巴勒斯坦抵抗运动，并加强这场斗争。
    阿塔西指出，犹太复国主义者不仅想使被占领的土地置于他们的控制之下，而且想迫使阿拉伯人完全投降。以色列打着“和平意图”的幌子，要求同阿拉伯人“直接谈判”，并通过联合国秘书长的“使节”雅林进行活动。但巴勒斯坦人的抵抗不仅给阿拉伯的失败主义者和投降主义者一记耳光，而且粉碎了以色列优势的神话。
    阿塔西说：“我们面临的战争是决定存亡的战争。”“我们必须为这场决定命运的战争动员阿拉伯的一切潜力。”他说，在军事方面，叙利亚已进一步加强了它的武装力量。
