The proletarian newspaper is a tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot have a capitalist position. Not even the "fourth position," not even a bit of position.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party complains that our newspapers only talk about how bad the capitalists are and that they have no good points. We ask him, what good points do the capitalists have? The capitalists are fundamentally people who have made their fortunes by exploiting and oppressing us workers. Underneath the capitalists' big factories and tall buildings, who knows how many workers' bones are buried; in the capitalists' fine food and wine, who knows how much of our workers' blood and tears have been shed. Ruthless exploitation and merciless oppression—that is the "good points" the capitalists have given us workers! We hate these cannibalistic devils to the core. Anyone who sings their praises, we will definitely overthrow!

The Chinese Khrushchev wants our newspapers to give the capitalists a position and to sing the tune of "labor-capital cooperation." Isn't this clearly trying to make our newspapers into a "unified" paper? Isn't this clearly trying to turn our Party newspaper into a "people's newspaper"? The Chinese Khrushchev loves the capitalists so much, he praises them to the skies, and tramples us workers under his feet. His likes and dislikes are so clear! Chairman Mao said, "There is no love without reason, and there is no hatred without reason." The Chinese Khrushchev has always been a loyal son and grandson of the capitalists, a bourgeois representative who has infiltrated our Party.

This biggest bourgeois representative in the Party says that our newspapers striking the bourgeoisie is "inappropriate." In our view, this is the most appropriate, the most reasonable, and the most natural thing to do. Think about it, before liberation, did the bourgeois newspapers give us workers a position to speak? Besides publishing all sorts of filth about the bourgeois masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies, they never published anything about our working class. If they did, it was only to slander and defame us.

Now, we workers have become the masters of the state and the leading class. Our newspapers can only speak for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, for the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, and can only serve proletarian politics. We must strike the bourgeoisie. If our newspapers give the capitalists and the ghosts and snakes of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists a position and freedom, then there will be no position and freedom for us workers. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen controlled the old Beijing Daily, Beijing Evening News, and Frontline, and released a large number of poisonous weeds and arrows, such as Evening Chats at Yan Mountain and Notes from Three Families Village, to engage in evil activities against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, making the newspapers a mess. We workers and poor and lower-middle peasants could not speak in such newspapers. It was Chairman Mao who led us to carry out this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, to seize back the news front from the counter-revolutionary revisionists like the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Zhen.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The Chinese Khrushchev wants to seize the newspapers and other public opinion tools to create public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration, and when the time is ripe, seize the entire regime, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Can we proletarians and revolutionary people allow the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to succeed? Absolutely not! We must thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist news line and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "not close the door to run the newspaper, but to face the masses, with a clear direction and fresh and lively content," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all news fronts and make the newspapers a powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

### 无产阶级报纸岂能有资本家的地位

    无产阶级报纸岂能有资本家的地位
    首都钢铁公司炼铁厂无产阶级革命派
    中国赫鲁晓夫是个地地道道的资产阶级代理人，他同资本家一个鼻孔出气，穿一条裤子。他胡说什么：“现在我们的报纸，在宣传上对自由资产阶级连第四位也没有，重点不是团结，而是打击，这也是不妥当的。”还胡说什么：“我们必须和他们合作。”这完全是一派混账话！
    我们要正告中国赫鲁晓夫，无产阶级的报纸是无产阶级专政的工具，绝不能有资本家的地位。甭说“第四位”，一点儿地位也不给。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，埋怨我们的报纸只说“资本家如何坏，一点好处也没有”。我们要质问他，资本家有什么好处？资本家压根儿就是靠剥削、压迫我们工人起家的。在资本家的大工厂、高楼大厦底下，不知埋葬着多少工人的白骨；在资本家的佳肴美酒里，不知流着多少工人的血泪。残酷的剥削，无情的压榨，这就是资本家给我们工人的“好处”！我们恨透了资本家这群吃人的魔鬼，谁要为资本家歌功颂德，我们就一定要把他打倒！
    中国赫鲁晓夫要我们的报纸给资本家地位，在报纸上大唱“劳资合作”的调子，这不明摆着是叫我们的报纸搞“合二而一”么？这不明摆着是要把我们的党报办成“全民报纸”么？中国赫鲁晓夫是这样的爱护资本家，把资本家捧上了天，把我们工人往脚底下踩。他的爱憎是多么鲜明呀！毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”中国赫鲁晓夫从来就是资本家的孝子贤孙，是混进我们党里来的资产阶级代理人。
    这个党内最大的资产阶级代理人，说什么我们的报纸打击资产阶级是“不妥当的”。在我们工人看来，这最妥当，最合理，是天经地义的。想一想，解放前，在资产阶级的报纸上有我们工人说话的地位吗？除了尽登些资产阶级老爷、太太、少爷、小姐的臭东西，从来也不登咱工人阶级的事。要登，也都是骂我们的，污蔑我们的。
    现在，我们工人阶级成了国家的主人，是领导阶级。我们的报纸，只能为工农兵说话，为无产阶级革命派说话，只能为无产阶级政治服务。对资产阶级就是要打击。在我们的报纸上如果有了资本家以及地、富、反、坏、右等牛鬼蛇神的地位和自由，就不会有咱们工人的地位和自由。反革命修正主义分子彭真掌握了旧《北京日报》、《北京晚报》、《前线》等报刊，就放出了《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》等大批毒草毒箭，猖狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，把报纸搞得乌烟瘴气。我们工人、贫下中农在那样的报刊上就说不了话。是毛主席领导我们进行了这次无产阶级文化大革命，才把中国赫鲁晓夫、彭真等等反革命修正主义分子窃取的新闻阵地夺了回来。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”中国赫鲁晓夫妄想把报纸等舆论工具夺过去，为反革命复辟制造舆论，等时机一到，夺取整个政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。我们无产阶级和革命人民能够容忍中国赫鲁晓夫这样的阴谋得逞吗？绝对不能！我们一定要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义新闻路线，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“不应当关门办报，应面向群众，又要有大方向，又要新鲜活泼”的最新指示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去占领一切新闻阵地，使报纸成为我们无产阶级专政的有力工具。
