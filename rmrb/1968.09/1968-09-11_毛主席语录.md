    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    The Communist Party and people of China and Algeria should unite, all Marxist-Leninists in the world should unite, and all revolutionary people in the world should unite. We must overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow all reactionaries in every country. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation will definitely be established.
