Thai workers in various parts of the country have recently staged continuous strikes, opposing the brutal oppression of the American-Thanon group, and fighting for improved living conditions and the defense of their legitimate rights.

According to "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, under the rule of the American-Thanon group, Thai workers are brutally exploited by American and other foreign capitalists, leading to extremely impoverished living conditions. They have repeatedly risen up to struggle and defend their legitimate rights.

The radio station reported that over 140 textile workers at a foreign-owned textile factory in Nakhoi Si, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, went on strike on September 7 to protest against the factory's brutal oppression. The striking workers, undeterred by the fascist police's threats, persisted in their struggle.

According to Thai newspapers, construction workers at the Pason Dam in Chiang Mai Province went on strike at the end of August to demand wage increases and improved living conditions. Due to the workers' unity, the authorities were forced to accept the workers' legitimate demands.

Taxi drivers in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province also went on strike on August 13 to protest against the brutal oppression of the Thanom puppet group, dealing a significant blow to the Thanom puppet group.

According to a broadcast by "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station on September 12, since the beginning of this year, workers in various parts of Thailand have staged 16 strikes and other forms of struggle, with a total of 8,000 workers participating.
