		Tokyo, September 15 (New China News Agency) — The organ of the National Coordination Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist) "People's Star" published an editorial on September 15, enthusiastically applauding the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province). The editorial pointed out that this is another great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The editorial said that this great victory proclaims that in a country with one-quarter of the world's population, a new power organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat has been fully established. This is not only a great milestone in the history of the Chinese people but also a great milestone in human history.

		The editorial pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong thoroughly smashed the Chinese Khrushchev, who had infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and attempted to restore capitalism, and foiled the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to restore capitalism in socialist China. It dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, greatly strengthening the forces of the revolutionary people of the world.

		The editorial said that currently, the world is engaged in a great struggle between the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary camps, with socialist China and the revolutionary people of the world on one side and U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries on the other. The revolutionary and progressive camp is becoming increasingly powerful, while the counter-revolutionary and reactionary camp is becoming increasingly weak. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism attempt to divide and rule the world, but this will only hasten their own downfall.

    人类发展史上一个伟大的划时代事件
    日共（左派）全国协议会机关报《人民之星》热烈欢呼我国山河一片红
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党（左派）全国协议会机关报《人民之星》十五日发表社论，热烈欢呼中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立。社论指出，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。社论说，这一伟大胜利宣告，在占世界人口四分之一的中国，已经全面地建立了无产阶级专政的新的权力机构。这不仅对中国人民，而且对人类发展的历史，是一个伟大的划时代的事件。
    社论指出，伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底地打垮了钻进中国无产阶级专政机构内部妄图复辟资本主义的中国赫鲁晓夫，粉碎了梦想在社会主义的中国复辟资本主义的美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的阴谋，给帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击，大大地加强了全世界革命人民的力量。
    社论说，当前，世界上以社会主义中国和世界革命人民为一方，以美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派为另一方，革命与反革命，进步与反动之间，展开了大搏斗。革命与进步的阵营日益强大；而反革命与反动阵营日益衰弱。美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义妄图由美苏两大国瓜分和主宰世界，它们到处横行霸道，但是，这只能促进它们自己走向瓦解。
