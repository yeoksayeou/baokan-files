The production workshop is bustling with activity. The high-frequency machines are roaring, the forming rollers are spinning rapidly, and the workers are laboring intensely and joyfully. Suddenly, the power center of the entire factory's production, the high-frequency electric furnace, malfunctions.

When it comes to this high-frequency electric furnace, all the workers in the factory frown. Originally, this high-frequency electric furnace was designed by a foreign "expert." Because of its poor quality, it frequently malfunctions, so the workers gave it a nickname: "Roadblock Tiger."

In the past, whenever it malfunctioned, the workers wanted to give it a "major surgery" and thoroughly reform this production "roadblock." However, each time they were obstructed by the factory's capitalist roaders. He would always put on a despicable servant's face, holding up a foreign book and saying, "This electric furnace was designed by a foreign 'expert' based on scientific data. You can't just tinker with it. If you want to fix it, you have to rely on a technical expert who understands its performance to do it."

This time, the high-frequency electric furnace malfunctioned again. Should the workers themselves take the initiative to repair it? The electrician group and the production group's several veteran workers had a revolutionary criticism session on this matter. Veteran worker Sun Jiatian said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to overthrow servility and bury dogmatism. But in the past, our factory's capitalist roaders stipulated that production workers are not allowed to fix machines, and maintenance personnel do not manage production. This revisionist framework must be broken. This time we must take the initiative and thoroughly reform the high-frequency electric furnace."

"Right!" Production group leader Wang Fumao continued, "Daring to think and daring to do, thoroughly revolutionizing, is the true character of the working class. No matter how precise the high-frequency electric furnace is, it cannot defeat the working class armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

A battle to repair the high-frequency electric furnace began. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, a "three-in-one" strike team consisting mainly of veteran workers, with revolutionary cadres and technicians participating, was quickly formed. They worked day and night. All the revolutionary workers in the factory were very satisfied with breaking the old maintenance system and allowing the worker masses to participate in the maintenance of precision machinery. Everyone's hearts were united, and their efforts were concentrated. Many workers who did not participate in the strike team stayed after work to become the "reserve force," ready to go at any call. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, after 46 hours of intense battle, a high-frequency electric furnace modified by the workers themselves was officially put into production. The workers joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

    一场打破洋框框的战斗
    生产车间里好一派沸腾景象。高频机在轰鸣，压型辊在飞快地旋转，工人们正在紧张而愉快地劳动着。突然，全厂生产的动力中心高频电炉出了故障。
    提起这个高频电炉，全厂的工人都皱眉头。原来，这个高频电炉是一个外国“专家”设计的，由于质量很差，经常出故障，工人们就送给它一个绰号叫“拦路虎”。
    过去每当它出故障时，工人就想给它动“大手术”，彻底改造这个生产上的“拦路虎”。可是，每一次都遭到了厂里走资派的阻拦，他总是摆出一副可恶的奴才相，捧着洋书本说：“这个电炉是外国‘专家’根据科学数据设计出来的，你们可不能随便摸。要修，也得靠懂得它的性能的技术专家来修。”
    这次高频电炉又出了故障，要不要由工人群众自己动手修理？电工组和生产一组的几位老师傅就这件事情展开了一场革命大批判。老工人孙家训说：“毛主席教导我们要打倒奴隶主义，埋葬教条主义，可是过去咱厂里的走资派规定生产工人不准修机器，维修人员不管生产，这种修正主义的框框必须打破，这次我们一定要自己动手，彻底改革高频电炉。”“对！”生产一组组长王福茂接着说：“敢想敢干，彻底革命，就是咱工人阶级的本色。高频电炉再精密，也难不倒用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级！”
    一场维修高频电炉的战斗开始了。在厂革委会的领导下，很快组成了以老工人为主体，由革命干部和技术员参加的“三结合”的突击小组，日夜奋战。全厂的革命工人，对打破旧维修制度，让工人群众自己参加精密机器的维修工作很满意，大家心往一块想，劲往一处使。没有参加突击小组的许多工人，晚上下了班也不回家，主动留下来当“预备队”，随叫随到。在毛泽东思想的指引下，经过四十六个小时的紧张战斗，一台由工人自己改制的高频电炉正式投入生产了。工人们满怀喜悦的心情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
