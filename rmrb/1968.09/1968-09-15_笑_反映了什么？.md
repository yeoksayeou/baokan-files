Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, every person lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are imprinted with class characteristics."

What does "laughing" reflect?

A worker comrade stood on the podium giving a class education lesson to the students. He used his own personal experiences and the family history of three generations of hardship to denounce the evil old society and vehemently criticize the reactionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev in praising the exploiting class and advocating the "exploitation is beneficial" theory. However, some students laughed while listening to the lecture. The worker comrade saw this and immediately pointed out sternly: "You shouldn't do this. Who would be happy about the poor being exploited and oppressed?"

"Your laughter reflects the sentiments of which class?" The worker comrade's sharp words shook everyone in the audience, and the hall instantly fell silent. Indeed, who would be happy? Only the landlords, only the capitalists. Landlords and capitalists hope that we, the poor, will forever be exploited and oppressed by them, to be their slaves. We, the children of workers and poor peasants, all have a bitter and difficult family history. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, who knows where we would be now? Why do worker comrades shed bitter tears while listening to class education lectures, while we laugh? Why is our sentiment towards the proletariat so weak? Why is this the case?

The worker comrade stood up and answered this question. The worker comrade said: "We have been oppressed and exploited in the past. Those imperialist and capitalist masters called us stinking workers, laborers, and poor craftsmen. In the past, we couldn't even find a door to beg for food, and we suffered from hunger and cold. Today, you are so fortunate! You have school to attend and books to read. This fortune is given to you by Chairman Mao. We originally wanted to send our children to school to study and cultivate our own successors. However, the traitor and scoundrel, Chinese Khrushchev, crazily opposes Chairman Mao and wants to take the capitalist road. In schools, he promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, openly advocating for 'learning for grades,' emphasizing 'academics first,' and telling you to 'ignore worldly affairs and focus solely on studying.' For a long time, schools have only focused on grades and not on class struggle or class education. This is to make you forget the past sufferings and forget how landlords and capitalists exploited and oppressed us workers and poor peasants. This is to make us forget to continue the revolution. In this way, he can achieve the goal of restoring capitalism. His intentions are so evil! We worker comrades see someone laughing, and we hate Chinese Khrushchev even more."

At this time, worker comrade Liu could not hold back his intense hatred for Chinese Khrushchev and spoke earnestly: "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'In this world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason.' The laughter reflects that our younger generation has forgotten the bitterness of the old society and has discarded the sentiments of the proletariat. This is the crime of Chinese Khrushchev. Forgetting the past sufferings means not knowing the sweetness of today; forgetting the past sufferings means not knowing why we need to continue the revolution; forgetting the past sufferings is a betrayal of the revolution!" The worker comrade's words further exposed the ugly counter-revolutionary face of Chinese Khrushchev.

"Forgetting the past sufferings is a betrayal of the revolution!" This sentence will be engraved in the minds of the young comrades. Everyone expressed their determination to never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    “笑”反映了什么？
    一位工人师傅站在讲台上给同学们上阶级教育课，他用自己亲身的经历，三代苦难的家史，控诉了万恶的旧社会，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧剥削阶级，鼓吹“剥削有功”论的反动本质。可是有个别学生在听课时竟发笑。工人同志看到这种情景便十分严肃地指出：“你们不能这样，穷人受剥削压迫谁才高兴？”
  “你们笑，这是那个阶级的感情啊！”工人同志尖锐的语言震动了在座的所有同学，立时会场鸦雀无声。是啊！谁才高兴？只有地主，只有资本家。地主、资本家就希望我们穷人永远受他们的剥削，受他们的压迫，做他们的牛马。我们这些工人、贫下中农的子女都有一部辛酸苦难的家史。没有毛主席，没有共产党，我们这些人还不知到什么地方去了呢？为什么工人同志听阶级教育课流出辛酸的眼泪，而我们却发笑？为什么我们对无产阶级的感情这样淡薄？这都是为什么？
    工人同志站起来，回答了这个问题。工人同志说：“我们这些人过去被压迫、剥削，那些帝国主义、资产阶级老爷们骂我们是臭工人，是苦力，是穷手艺棒。过去我们要饭找不上门，挨饥受饿。今天你们多幸福啊！有学上，有书念。这个福是毛主席他老人家给的啊！我们本想把子女送到学校去学习。培养出自己的接班人。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒、大坏蛋，他疯狂地反对毛主席，要走资本主义道路，在学校推行反革命修正主义教育路线，公开号召你们为‘分’学习，提倡‘智育第一’，要你们‘两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书’。长期以来，学校里只抓分数，不抓阶级斗争，不搞阶级教育，就是要让你们忘记过去苦，忘记过去地主、资本家是怎样剥削、怎样压迫我们工人、贫下中农的，就是让我们忘记继续进行革命，这样，他就可以达到复辟资本主义的目的，用心何其毒啊！我们工人同志看到有人笑，无不更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫。”这时，工人刘师傅也按捺不住对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨的心情，语重心长地讲了起来：“毛主席他老人家教导我们，‘世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨’，笑的后面反映了我们的后一代把旧社会的苦忘记了，把无产阶级的感情丢掉了，这是中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶。忘记了过去的苦，就不知道今天的甜；忘记了过去的苦，就不知道为什么要继续进行革命；忘记了过去的苦，就是对革命的背叛！”工人同志的话进一步揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶的反革命面目。
      “忘记过去的苦，是对革命的背叛！”这句话将铭记在小将们的脑子里。大家表示一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗！
