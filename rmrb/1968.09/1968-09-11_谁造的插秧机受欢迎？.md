In June of this year, a fully functional transplanter was successfully developed in just three months by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants at the Taicang County Farm Implement Factory in Jiangsu Province.

After its completion, this transplanter was tested in five locations, including Taicang City Suburban Commune, Xinhu Commune, Shaxi Commune, and Nanxing Production Brigade in Wuxi County, and Penglang Commune in Kunshan County, covering a total of 200 mu (approximately 33 acres) of fields. It received unanimous praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. During the testing, people continuously came to observe the transplanter in action, some even traveling from dozens of miles away. Everyone was full of praise. Many communes and production brigades placed orders with the factory after visiting.

Additionally, there is another transplanter in the Taicang County Farm Implement Factory, which was made by two engineers from the factory. They monopolized the blueprints and went to a well-equipped metalworking factory to produce it. This transplanter had numerous issues and was not user-friendly, and now it sits unused.

The starkly different fates of these two transplanters greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses and struck a blow to the arrogance of the bourgeois technical authorities! It once again proved with irrefutable facts that the great leader Chairman Mao's words, "The lowly are the wisest, the noble are the most foolish," are an unbreakable truth.

The Taicang County Farm Implement Factory started as a small screw workshop with only seven people in 1962. The factory had no standard lathes, no technicians, and no engineers. Most of the workers were young apprentices. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, the provincial agricultural machinery research department sent so-called "experts," engineers, and technicians to the factory, claiming to be there to "work on the ground" and reform agricultural machinery. However, after less than three months, they saw that the factory had no "benefits" and couldn't produce anything significant, so they quietly left. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee and the county handicrafts association fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's series of brilliant directives on agricultural mechanization, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and opposing the factory's production orientation towards rural areas. They opposed the manufacture of farm implements welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, making the factory, which was supposed to be a farm implement factory, into a mere standard parts processing factory, unable to play its role in supporting agriculture.

During the Cultural Revolution, the workers and revolutionary cadres of this factory rebelled against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. They fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, overturned many of the frameworks set by the capitalist roaders, and defied all bourgeois technical authorities. Based on Chairman Mao's directives on agricultural mechanization, they established an agricultural machinery experimental group within the factory that included poor and lower-middle peasants from outside the factory. This group consisted of a peasant carpenter and a few young workers with low cultural levels, totaling six people. They were determined to create the most practical farm implements for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Last October, this group decided to develop a motorized transplanter based on the urgent needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the eyes of the bourgeois technical authorities, it was absurd for these "rough" workers to attempt to create a transplanter. An engineer from the provincial agricultural machinery research institute told the experimental group, "If you want to make a transplanter, you'll need at least five years of preparation." Two so-called engineers suppressed the workers' enthusiasm for developing a motorized transplanter while monopolizing the only set of blueprints and attempting to develop it in another, better-equipped metalworking factory, determined to compete with the workers.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they can solve any human difficulties." People repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, gaining the courage and strength to fight against the bourgeois technical authorities. They said, "We warmly welcome any intellectuals who are willing to integrate with workers and peasants; as for those bourgeois technical authorities who look down on or oppose workers and peasants, we will not put them in our eyes. If the bourgeois lords don't give us the blueprints, we'll create our own!" Thus, they drew their own designs and blueprints. With blueprints in hand, the experimental group followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went out to the countryside to widely solicit the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and at the same time propagated Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on agricultural mechanization. They also directly linked up with Taisheng Brigade in the City Suburban Commune. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Taisheng Brigade, in order to allow the transplanter to undergo performance testing before large-scale transplanting, prepared seedbeds and germinated seedlings in greenhouses during the Spring Festival. The enthusiastic support and help from the poor and lower-middle peasants gave the experimental group more confidence. They used local methods and scrap materials to overcome the difficulties of lacking tools and materials. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," they firmly held their production posts with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and hurriedly developed the transplanter. They were determined, fearless of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory, continuously drawing strength from Chairman Mao's teachings. After three months of continuous struggle, the transplanter was finally assembled.

In early May of this year, this transplanter was first tested in the countryside. Initially, the seedlings were planted somewhat disorderly, and there were many gaps. The experimental group worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants during the day and studied and discussed at night, finding problems, identifying causes, and humbly listening to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. With the enthusiastic encouragement and help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, after eight days of testing and returning to the factory for improvements, the transplanter, in its second test in mid-June, finally overcame the original defects. They continued to listen to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants in practice, improving the machine's structure and operating techniques while transplanting, making this transplanter better and better, and more and more welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The results of the testing showed that this transplanter can save labor, effort, and time. The work efficiency can be increased by about twelve times compared to manual transplanting. In Taisheng Brigade, a production team used the transplanter to transplant more than fifty mu of seedlings. Under the same conditions of water and fertilizer, twenty-five days later, the growth situation was significantly better than the manually transplanted rice fields of the same period. According to the estimates of the community members, the number of ears per mu would definitely be more than manual transplanting, resulting in increased production. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw the transplanter that the workers had successfully developed with them and were overjoyed. They compared manual transplanting with motorized transplanting and excitedly said, "In the past, we faced the yellow mud and had our backs to the sky, with sore backs and painful legs, but now we sit on chairs and our hearts are sweet, adding enthusiasm to grain production." They couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

    谁造的插秧机受欢迎？
    今年六月，在江苏太仓县农具厂里，一台完全由工人、贫下中农自己动手，只花了三个月时间试制成功的插秧机诞生了。
    这台插秧机出世以后，先后在太仓城郊公社、新湖公社、沙溪公社和吴江县南星大队、昆山县蓬阆公社等五个地方试插了二百亩田，得到了广大贫下中农的一致赞扬。在试插的时候，每天不断有人赶来看插秧机操作，有的甚至从几十里以外的地方赶来，大家赞不绝口。许多社队参观后都纷纷向农具厂订货。
    另外，太仓县农具厂里还有一部插秧机，是厂里两个工程师，垄断了图纸，到设备技术条件都比较好的五金厂去制造的。这部插秧机一出来就毛病百出，不好使用，现在摆在那里无人问津。
    两部插秧机截然不同的命运，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级技术权威的威风！它用雄辩的事实，再一次证明了伟大领袖毛主席所说的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    太仓县农具厂是在一九六二年从一个只有七个人的螺丝加工铺发展起来的。厂里既没有一台标准车床，更没有一个技术员和工程师，绝大部分工人都是青年艺徒。无产阶级文化大革命初期，省农机研究部门曾派来一些所谓农机“专家”、工程师、技术员，说是到农具厂“蹲点”，搞农机改革，可是不到三个月时间，他们看看农具厂没有“油水”，搞不出什么“名堂”，就悄悄地溜走了。旧县委、县手工业联社内一小撮走资派也疯狂抵制毛主席有关农业机械化的一系列英明指示，竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，反对农具厂的生产面向农村，反对制造为贫下中农所欢迎的农具，使这个厂名为农具厂，实际上只是一个标准件加工厂，根本不能发挥它在支援农业中应起的作用。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的工人和革命干部起来向党内一小撮走资派造反了。他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，推倒了走资派所设下的许多条条框框，藐视一切资产阶级技术权威，根据毛主席关于农业机械化的指示，在厂里成立了一个吸收厂外贫下中农参加的农业机械试验小组，这个小组由一个农民木匠和几个文化水平不高的青年工人一共六个人组成。他们决心要为贫下中农搞出最实用的农具来。
    去年十月，这个小组根据广大贫下中农的迫切要求，确定试造机动插秧机。工人“老大粗”要摸插秧机这个“老虎屁股”，在资产阶级技术权威眼里，简直是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。省农机所的一个所谓的工程师对试制组的同志说：“你们要造插秧机，起码得准备五年时间。”两个所谓的工程师，一面打击工人们试制机动插秧机的积极性，一面却垄断了唯一的一套图纸，在另一个条件较好的五金厂试造起来，硬是要和工人唱对台戏。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”人们反复学习了毛主席的教导，增添了与资产阶级技术权威作斗争的勇气和力量。他们说，凡是愿意和工农相结合的知识分子，我们热烈欢迎；至于那些看不起甚至反对工农的资产阶级技术权威，我们决不把他们放在眼下。资产阶级老爷不给我们图纸，我们就自己搞！于是，他们自己动手画样子，晒图纸。有了图纸，试制组的同志遵循毛主席的教导，走出厂门，到农村中广泛征求贫下中农的意见，同时向贫下中农宣传毛主席关于农业机械化的英明指示。他们还与城郊公社太胜三队直接挂钩。太胜三队的贫下中农和干部为了使插秧机能在大面积插秧前作性能试验，在春节期间踏冰做秧田进行温床育苗。贫下中农的热情支持和帮助，使试制组的同志更有了信心。他们利用土办法、废料，克服了没有工具、没有材料的困难，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，坚守生产岗位，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，加紧试造。他们“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，不断从毛主席的教导中汲取力量，经过连续三个月的奋战，插秧机终于装配起来了。
    今年五月初，这台插秧机第一次下乡试插，开始时秧插得比较乱，漏棵也比较多，试制组的同志白天和贫下中农一起试插，晚上就一起学习、座谈，找问题，查原因，虚心听取贫下中农的意见。在贫下中农的热情鼓励和帮助下，经过八天试插，又回厂改进。六月中旬，经过改进后第二次下乡试插的插秧机，终于克服了原来存在的缺点。他们又在实践中不断听取贫下中农的意见，边插边改进机器结构和操作技术，使这台插秧机越改越好，越受贫下中农的欢迎。
    经过试插的结果，这种插秧机可以省工、省力、省时。工效比手插可以提高十二倍左右。太胜大队一个生产队用插秧机所插的五十多亩秧，在水、肥等条件相同的情况下，二十五天以后，生长情况明显地超过了同期手插的稻田。据社员估计，每亩穗数肯定比手插的多，比手插的增产。贫下中农看到工人们和自己在一起试制成功的这台插秧机，打心里感到高兴，他们把用手工插秧和机动插秧机插秧作了对比，兴奋地说：“过去是脸朝黄泥背朝天，腰酸腿痛苦不浅，现在是坐上椅子心里甜，生产粮食干劲添。”他们情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
