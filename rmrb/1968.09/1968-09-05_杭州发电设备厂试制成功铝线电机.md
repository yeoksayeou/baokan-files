Hangzhou Power Equipment Factory Successfully Trials Aluminum Wire Motor

The revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel of Hangzhou Power Equipment Factory have recently successfully trialed an aluminum wire motor. They solved a problem that had not been addressed for a long time under the control of a small clique of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" within the factory in just eight months.

Using aluminum wire instead of copper wire to produce motors can fully utilize China's abundant aluminum resources, marking a major innovation in the motor industry. Hangzhou Power Equipment Factory began trials as early as 1960. However, due to the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, they blindly followed foreign dogmas, suppressed the creative spirit of the masses, and the trials were unsuccessful for a long time.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "The Chinese people have spirit, have ability, and will certainly catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." They were determined to successfully trial the aluminum wire motor, which the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie believed could not be done.

During the trial process, revolutionary workers fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Technical personnel actively went to the workshops to work and trial with the workers, leading to the rapid success of the aluminum wire motor trial.

    杭州发电设备厂试制成功铝线电机
    杭州发电设备厂的革命工人和革命技术人员最近试制成功了铝线电机。他们仅用八个月时间，就解决了过去在厂里党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”把持下长期没有解决的问题。
    以铝线代替铜线生产电机，可以充分利用我国铝的丰富资源，是电机工业生产的一项重大革新。杭州发电设备厂早在一九六○年就开始试制。但是，由于走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，迷信洋教条，扼杀群众的创造精神，长期没有试制成功。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命的工人和革命的技术人员牢记毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，决心把资产阶级反动技术“权威”认为搞不成的铝线电机试制成功。
    在试制过程中，革命职工狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，技术人员主动下车间和工人一起劳动，一起试制，使铝线电机迅速试制成功。
