Tokyo, September 23 (Xinhua) - The Central Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Japan International Trade Promotion Association overcame the numerous obstacles set by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and held a celebration on September 22 in Tokyo to mark the fourth anniversary of Chinese cargo ships sailing to Japan. Over 650 friends from various sectors in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture attended the gathering, along with crew members from the Chinese cargo ship "Dongfeng."

In the center of the venue, a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hung, with a large red banner below it reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought." Around the venue, there were banners displaying the important inscription given by the great teacher Chairman Mao to Japanese worker friends: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubted."

Tsujiwa Ikuo, a standing director of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, delivered the opening speech. He said, "We originally planned to hold a celebration for the fourth anniversary of Chinese cargo ships sailing to Japan on July 20 this year, but due to the unreasonable obstruction and sabotage by the Japanese reactionaries, we were unable to proceed. Since that day, we have been fighting resolutely against the Japanese reactionaries, continuously exposing their reactionary nature of hostility towards China. Through this struggle, we have finally achieved victory today."

He concluded by expressing that in the future, they will strive to further develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

Taniya Binshi, the chairman of the Central Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), spoke at the meeting. He said, "After two months of struggle, we are able to hold such a grand celebration with the crew of the 'Dongfeng' today. This fact proves that the friendly movement between the peoples of Japan and China cannot be obstructed or destroyed by any force."

Taniya warmly congratulated the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) under the guidance of the great thought of Chairman Mao. He said, "This is a brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This victory is a great encouragement and support for all peoples fighting against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries."

Taniya said, "To restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible, to further develop the Japan-China friendship movement, trade exchanges, and cultural exchanges, we will organize a broader united front that includes workers, peasants, youth, women, and cultural figures from Japan."

Taniya concluded with the slogans: "Long live the fighting unity of the peoples of Japan and China! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, ten thousand times, ten thousand times, ten thousand times!"

The representative of the "Dongfeng" ship was invited to speak at the meeting. He expressed heartfelt thanks to the Japanese friends for their warm reception and the great help they have provided over the past four years for the sailing of Chinese cargo ships to Japan.

A representative of Japanese port workers presented a red flag to the Chinese crew members amidst enthusiastic applause. The flag read, "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought! Long Live the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

Japanese youth friends performed revolutionary art programs praising the great teacher Chairman Mao with great passion. The Chinese crew members also performed revolutionary songs and national music praising the great leader Chairman Mao.

The celebration concluded with everyone singing "The East Is Red" together.

    事实证明日中两国人民友好运动是任何力量破坏不了的
    新华社二十三日讯  东京消息：日中友好协会（正统）中央总部和日本国际贸易促进协会排除美日反动派设置的重重阻碍，二十二日在东京举行联欢会，热烈庆祝中国货轮航行日本四周年。参加集会的有东京和神奈川县的日本各界朋友六百五十多人，中国货轮“东风”轮的船员应邀出席了联欢会。
    会场中央悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，下面悬挂着写有“毛泽东思想万岁”的一面大红旗。会场周围挂着伟大导师毛主席赠送给日本工人朋友的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    日本国际贸易促进协会常务理事皆川郁夫致开会词说，我们原来预定在今年七月二十日举行庆祝中国货轮航行日本四周年的联欢会，但由于受到日本反动派的无理阻挠和破坏，而无法举行。从那天起，我们一直同日本反动派进行坚决的斗争，不断揭露日本反动派敌视中国的反动本质。通过斗争，今天我们终于取得了胜利。
    他最后表示，今后要为进一步发展日中两国人民的战斗友谊而奋斗。
    日中友好协会（正统）中央总部常任理事长谷川敏三在会上讲话说，经过了两个月的斗争，今天我们同“东风”轮的船员一起举行了这样盛大的联欢会，这个事实证明，日中两国人民的友好运动是任何力量也阻挠和破坏不了的。
    长谷川热情祝贺在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，中国全国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立了革命委员会。他说，这是伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。这个胜利，对于一切同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义以及各国反动派进行斗争的人民是个极大的鼓舞和支持。
    长谷川说，为了早日恢复日中两国的邦交，进一步发展日中友好运动、贸易往来和文化交流，我们将更广泛地组织有日本的工人、农民、青年、妇女以及文化界参加的统一战线。
    长谷川最后高呼：“日中两国人民的战斗团结万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    “东风”轮的代表应邀在会上讲了话。他对日本朋友的热情接待和四年来日本朋友为中国货轮航行日本所给予的大力帮助，表示衷心感谢。
    日本港湾工人代表在热烈的掌声中，向中国船员赠送了一面红旗。旗上写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”
    日本青年朋友们在联欢会上满怀激情地演出了颂扬伟大导师毛主席的革命文艺节目。中国船员们也表演了歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的革命歌曲和民族乐曲。
    联欢会在全体齐唱《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
