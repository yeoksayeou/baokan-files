This doctor, who went from the city to the countryside, proves that the majority, or a large number, of students trained in old schools can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them even make inventions and innovations. However, this requires correct leadership and re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcome by workers, peasants, and soldiers. If you don't believe it, just look at the doctor from Jiang Town Commune, Chuansha County, Shanghai.
