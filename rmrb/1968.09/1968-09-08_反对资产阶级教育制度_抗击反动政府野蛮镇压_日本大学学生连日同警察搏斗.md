		Progressive students at Tokyo's Nihon University have been continuously fighting against the armed police sent by the reactionary Sato government to oppose the bourgeois decaying education system. They have seized the economics and law departments' teaching buildings for the fourth time.

		They have received enthusiastic support from workers and residents near the school, making the struggle increasingly larger.

		As early as June 15, progressive students at Nihon University had already started their struggle. They seized the administrative offices and department buildings, raised the red flag on the campus, and persisted in their struggle.

		The reactionary school authorities called in a large number of armed police, who, starting from September 4, repeatedly broke into the school, attacking and arresting students, which further intensified the students' struggle.

		Despite the brutal attacks by the armed police of the reactionary Sato government, the students of Nihon University formed several combat teams of a few hundred people each on September 6. They fought around the teaching buildings of the economics, law, and science departments.

		Students in the economics and law departments bravely drove away the thugs hired by the school authorities to suppress the students and seized the teaching buildings of these two departments for the fourth time.

		The reactionary Sato government, terrified of the students' struggle, ruthlessly sent more than 2,000 fully armed police, as well as many armored cars and water cannons, to brutally attack the students.

		The students were extremely indignant at the police's suppression and immediately gathered from all directions to the front of the economics department building. They held up red flags and marched through the streets in protest.

		Workers and residents along the route continuously joined the protest, increasing the number of protesters to nearly 10,000. They shouted slogans such as "Down with Koda (the chairman of Nihon University)" and "Police, get out!" while explaining the students' just struggle to the residents.

		An employee of a bookstore along the protest route waved a red flag with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," expressing support for the protesters.

		More than 2,000 reactionary police brutally suppressed the protesters, using tear gas and water cannons to attack the students. The students fiercely threw stones in retaliation. The reactionary police illegally arrested 35 students.

		Currently, the students' struggle is still ongoing.

    反对资产阶级教育制度　抗击反动政府野蛮镇压
    日本大学学生连日同警察搏斗
    学生斗争得到工人和市民热情支持，斗争规模越来越大
    新华社七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京日本大学进步学生，为反对资产阶级腐朽的教育制度，连日来继续同佐藤反动政府派遣的武装警察进行激烈搏斗，第四次占领了这个学校经济系和法学系的教学大楼。
    他们在斗争中得到了学校附近的工人和市民的热情支持，使斗争规模越来越大。
    早在六月十五日，日本大学的进步学生就进行了斗争，他们占领校部和各系大楼，在校园里升起了红旗，并坚持斗争。
    学校反动当局召来大批武装警察，从九月四日以来连续几次闯进学校，大肆袭击和搜捕学生，因而激起了学生斗争的进一步发展。
    不顾佐藤反动政府武装警察的野蛮袭击，日本大学的学生们，六日组成了一些几百个人一队的战斗队，分别在经济系、法学系和理工系的教学楼周围展开了斗争。
    经济系和法学系的学生，英勇地赶走了学校当局雇佣来镇压学生的打手，第四次占领了这两个系的教学大楼。
    对学生的斗争怕得要死的佐藤反动政府，悍然出动了两千多名全副武装的警察以及许多辆装甲车和喷水车，对学生进行野蛮袭击。
    学生们对武装警察的镇压极为愤慨，立刻从四面八方集合到经济系大楼前，他们举着红旗，到大街上举行示威游行。
    沿途的工人和市民不断地加入游行队伍，使示威群众增加到近万人。他们一面高呼“打倒古田（日本大学董事长）”、“警察滚回去”等口号，一面向市民们宣传学生的正义斗争。
    在游行线路上的一家书店的职员挥动起写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗，表示支持示威的群众。
    两千多名反动警察对示威群众进行野蛮镇压，他们用催泪弹和水龙袭击学生。学生们猛烈地投掷石块，对警察进行英勇反击。反动警察无理逮捕了三十五名学生。
    目前，学生的斗争还在继续进行着。
