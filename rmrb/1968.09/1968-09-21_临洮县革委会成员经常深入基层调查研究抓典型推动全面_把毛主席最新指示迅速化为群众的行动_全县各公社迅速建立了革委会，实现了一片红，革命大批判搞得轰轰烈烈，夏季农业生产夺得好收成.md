Members of the Linxia County Revolutionary Committee often go to the grassroots for investigation and research, grasp typical cases to promote the overall situation, and quickly turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the actions of the masses. Revolutionary committees have been rapidly established in all communes throughout the county, achieving a complete red victory. The revolutionary mass criticism movement is booming, and the summer agricultural production has achieved a good harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: The Linxia County Revolutionary Committee in Gansu Province closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. By grasping typical cases and promoting the overall situation, it has quickly turned Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the revolutionary actions of the entire county.

Every time Chairman Mao issues the latest instructions, the main leaders of the county revolutionary committee follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "spending some time to go among the masses, see what they are thinking and doing, and from this find advanced experiences to popularize." They go to the grassroots and among the masses to conduct investigations and research, understand the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots and among the masses, and find new creations and good typical cases. They then hold on-site meetings to vigorously promote these, setting an example for the entire county to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Since its establishment in December last year, eight out of the eleven standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee have frequently gone to the grassroots and among the masses for investigations and research. Over the past ten months, the entire county has discovered and set up advanced typical units or individuals in various aspects such as studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, revolutionary mass criticism, purging the class ranks, educating the revolution, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." The leaders of the county revolutionary committee found at the grassroots that in some units, due to the influence of bourgeois factionalism, they could not correctly handle cadres who had made mistakes, and the revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination could not be established for a long time. At the same time, they also found that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongtao Commune firmly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They comprehensively analyzed the entire history and all work of the cadres, correctly handled the cadres, patiently educated the cadres to correct their mistakes, and helped the cadres stand up for the revolution. They quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance and established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination. After discovering this typical case, the county revolutionary committee held large and small meetings to introduce their experiences in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting the entire county to strictly implement Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling cadres. As a result, in less than three months, revolutionary committees were established in all communes, and the entire county achieved a complete red victory.

In the midst of this great situation where the entire county has achieved a complete red victory, some units have shown signs of relaxation in their revolutionary mass criticism. Some people think that their unit's Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories and can "take a breather," thus showing a phenomenon of "criticizing when idle, neglecting when busy." Based on this active thinking and new problems that have arisen in the revolutionary mass criticism, the comrades of the county revolutionary committee believe that to carry out the revolutionary mass criticism deeply and persistently, two issues must be resolved: one is the issue of recognizing the great significance of revolutionary mass criticism; the other is the issue of methods for deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary mass criticism. To resolve these two issues, on the one hand, the county revolutionary committee continuously uses Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," combined with the actual situation of class struggle in this region, to educate the broad revolutionary masses, raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and raise their recognition of the great significance of revolutionary mass criticism; at the same time, strengthen leadership, go deep into the grassroots and among the masses, discover typical cases where revolutionary mass criticism is well done, and promote it throughout the county. Through extensive investigations, they discovered that the revolutionary mass criticism in Xintian Commune is deep and persistent. The revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in each production brigade and production team of this commune all actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and all rush to the battlefield of revolutionary mass criticism. In the revolutionary mass criticism, they always insist on "one study, two expose, three criticize, four reform" (i.e., studying Chairman Mao's works; using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose the evil plots of China's Khrushchev and his local agents to restore capitalism; criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents; and reforming according to Mao Zedong Thought), and insist on four combinations (i.e., combining with the class struggle situation; combining with various tasks; combining with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit; and combining criticism of revisionism with self-criticism). Therefore, the criticism is relatively deep and the effect is relatively good. They also, based on the characteristics of rural residents being scattered, the busy and idle seasons of farming, and the different cultural levels of the members, adopted various flexible and mobile forms of criticism such as field criticism meetings, evening criticism meetings, and family criticism meetings. The county revolutionary committee believes that the experiences created by the revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Xintian Commune solve the two issues that need to be resolved for deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary mass criticism throughout the county, and immediately organized representatives from communes, organs, and schools to visit and learn from this commune. The leaders of the county revolutionary committee also went to the site to help summarize the experiences of this commune, hold on-site meetings, and promote them. Representatives from some units that had relaxed their revolutionary mass criticism, after learning from Xintian Commune, deeply felt: "One does not know until one learns, and one is shocked after learning. The gap has been found, and the direction is clearer." Due to the establishment of Xintian Commune as a living example and the adoption of other measures, the revolutionary mass criticism in the communes, organs, and schools throughout the county is burning more fiercely. From children as young as ten to elderly people with white hair, everyone is criticizing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism with both pen and mouth. The counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "work points in command" and "three autonomies and one contract" spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents have been criticized like rats crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them. In the cities and countryside of Linxia, one often hears the folk rhymes spread by the people of the entire county: "Work points in command, the more it hangs, the worse it gets," "Three autonomies and one contract, the more it is contracted, the worse it gets," "The character 'revisionism' is a tree, the character 'self' is the root, if the tree is cut but the root is not dug out, it will soon sprout again." Due to the widespread and deep development of revolutionary mass criticism, the broad revolutionary people of the entire county are more spirited, the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held higher and higher, the socialist road is walked more and more broadly, and the collective economy is more and more consolidated.

The Linxia County Revolutionary Committee pays special attention to following the mass line when grasping typical cases, making the established typical cases have a broad mass base, and being able to quickly promote and blossom everywhere. For example, in Yaodian Commune, there is a production team called Wu Jia. It actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out the learning from Dazhai movement, greatly promoted the thought revolution of the people, and turned a poor mountain village into a new mountain village full of revolutionary vigor and surplus grain in every household. After discovering this typical case, eleven standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee went to Wu Jia for investigations one after another and had extensive discussions with the commune members. They also went to nearby communes and production teams to listen to the masses' reactions to Wu Jia's grasping the revolution and promoting production. They found that some communes had already taken the initiative to go to Wu Jia for visits and learning. After the county revolutionary committee established Wu Jia production team as a typical case, the entire county quickly launched a mass movement of learning from and catching up with Wu Jia. In June this year, the agricultural production of the entire county was threatened by a severe drought, but due to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants learning from Dazhai and catching up with Wu Jia, the labor enthusiasm was very high. The people of the entire county day and night engaged in the anti-drought struggle, worked hard for half a month, overcame the drought, and achieved a good harvest this summer.

The comrades of this county revolutionary committee deeply felt that by grasping typical cases to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the effect is quick and the result is great. Typical cases that embody Chairman Mao's latest instructions are typical cases of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and are typical cases of combining theory with practice. Establishing such typical cases greatly carries forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao. They also felt that after the revolutionary committee implemented streamlining and efficiency, there were fewer people but more tasks. Grasping typical cases to guide the overall situation is an extremely effective method to resolve the contradiction of fewer people but more tasks. They called this method "focusing on the point and blooming on the surface."

    临洮县革委会成员经常深入基层调查研究抓典型推动全面
    把毛主席最新指示迅速化为群众的行动
    全县各公社迅速建立了革委会，实现了一片红，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，夏季农业生产夺得好收成
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省临洮县革命委员会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，通过狠抓典型，推动全面，使毛主席的最新指示迅速化为全县人民的革命行动。
    每当毛主席发出最新指示以后，县革委会的主要负责人就遵照毛主席关于“拿出一些时间到群众中去走一走，看看群众在想些什么，做些什么，从其中找出先进经验，加以推广”的教导，到基层去，到群众中去，进行调查研究，了解基层和群众落实毛主席最新指示的情况，基层和群众落实毛主席最新指示有什么新创造，好典型，就召开现场会议，大力推广，给全县人民树立落实毛主席最新指示的活样板。县革委会从去年十二月成立以来，十一名常委中经常有八名常委深入基层，深入群众，作调查研究。近十个月来，全县在活学活用毛主席著作，办毛泽东思想学习班，革命大联合和革命三结合，革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，教育革命，抓革命促生产等方面，都发现和树立了先进典型单位或先进典型人物。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”县革委会的负责同志在基层发现，有些单位，由于资产阶级派性作怪，不能正确地对待犯错误的革命干部，三结合的革命委员会迟迟不能成立。同时也发现，红涛公社广大贫下中农坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，他们全面分析干部的整个历史和全部工作，正确地对待干部，耐心教育干部改正错误，帮助干部站出来革命，迅速实现了革命大联合，建立了三结合的革命委员会。县革委会发现这个典型以后，大会讲，小会谈，介绍他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席最新指示的经验，推动全县不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席关于正确对待干部的指示。结果，不到三个月的时间，各公社都建立了革命委员会，全县实现了一片红。
    在全县实现一片红的大好形势下，有些单位的革命大批判，出现了松劲的苗头。有些人认为，本单位的文化大革命取得了决定性胜利，可以“松口气”了，因而对革命大批判出现了“闲了抓，忙了放”的现象。根据这种活思想和革命大批判中出现的新问题，县革委会的同志认为，要把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，必须解决两个问题：一个是解决对革命大批判的重大意义的认识问题；一个是解决深入持久地开展革命大批判的方法问题。为了解决这两个问题，一方面，县革委会不断地用毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，结合本地区阶级斗争的实际情况，教育广大革命群众，提高群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，提高他们对革命大批判的重大意义的认识；同时加强领导，深入基层，深入群众，去发现革命大批判搞得好的典型，来推动全县。他们经过广泛调查，发现新添公社的革命大批判，批得深，又能经常坚持。这个公社各生产大队、生产队的革命干部以及广大贫下中农，人人活学活用毛泽东思想，个个杀向革命大批判的战场。他们在革命大批判中，始终坚持“一学、二揭、三批、四改”（即学习毛主席著作；以毛泽东思想为武器，揭露中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋；批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的反革命修正主义黑货；按照毛泽东思想进行改革），坚持四个结合（即同阶级斗争形势相结合；同各项工作任务相结合；同本单位斗、批、改相结合；批修与斗私结合），因而批得比较深，效果比较好。他们还根据农村居住分散、农时季节忙闲不一、社员文化程度不同等特点，采取了田头批判会、晚上批判会、家庭批判会等多种多样、灵活机动的批判形式。县革委会认为，新添公社革命干部和贫下中农创造的这些经验，解决了全县深入持久地开展革命大批判所需要解决的两个问题，便立即组织各公社、机关、学校的代表，到这个公社参观学习。县革委会的负责同志也到现场，帮助总结这个公社的经验，召开现场会议，加以推广。一些放松了革命大批判的单位的代表，到新添公社学习后深有体会地说：“不学不知道，一学吓一跳，差距找到了，方向更明了。”由于树立了新添公社这个活样板，以及采取了其他措施，全县社队、机关、学校革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。全县从十来岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，人人口诛笔伐，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“工分挂帅”、“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货已被批得象过街老鼠，人人喊打。在临洮城乡，经常可以听到全县人民流传的顺口溜：“工分挂帅，越挂越坏”，“三自一包，越包越糟”，“修字是棵树，私字是树根，砍树不挖根，早晚要生枝”。由于革命大批判广泛深入的开展，全县广大革命人民更加意气风发，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗越举越高，社会主义大道越走越宽，集体经济越来越巩固。
    临洮县革委会抓典型，特别注意走群众路线，使树立的典型有广泛的群众基础，树立起来能迅速推广，遍地开花。例如，尧甸公社有个武家生产队，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，活学活用毛主席著作，开展学大寨的活动，极大地促进了人的思想革命化，把一个穷山村变成了一个充满革命朝气的、家家有余粮的新山村。县革委会发现这个典型以后，十一个常委先后来到武家作调查，同社员广泛交谈。他们还到附近社队听取群众对武家生产队抓革命、促生产的反应。他们发现，有的社队已经主动去武家参观学习。县革委会树立武家生产队这个典型以后，全县迅速掀起了一个学武家、赶武家的群众运动。今年六月间，全县农业生产遇到严重干旱威胁，但是由于广大贫下中农学大寨、赶武家，劳动热情十分高涨，全县人民日夜投入抗旱斗争，大干半个月，战胜了干旱，取得了今年夏季好收成。
    这个县革委会的同志深深体会到，通过抓典型落实毛主席的最新指示，见效快，收效大。体现毛主席最新指示的典型，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的典型，是理论和实际相结合的典型。树立这样的典型，大大发扬了毛主席倡导的理论和实际相结合的革命学风。他们还体会到革命委员会精兵简政以后，人少任务重，通过抓典型指导全面，是解决人少任务重这个矛盾的极有效的方法。他们把这种方法叫做“点上下功夫，面上开红花”。
