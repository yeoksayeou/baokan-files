The Voice of the Thai People radio station stated on the 13th that the Thai version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" volumes one to four, published by the Beijing Foreign Languages Publishing House, has great and profound significance for the Thai revolution. It has greatly inspired the Thai revolutionary people and strengthened their confidence in defeating the American imperialist invaders and the Thanom-Praphas co-sellout clique.

The radio station said that the Thai people and the armed fighters have deeply felt from the actual conditions of the Thai revolution and their own personal experiences that as long as they study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and combine it with the Thai revolution, they can overcome all enemies, surmount any difficulties and obstacles.

The radio station also emphasized that under the call of the Communist Party of Thailand to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to resolutely carry the armed struggle to the end, the publication of the Thai version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" will surely promote the movement of the Thai people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and effectively. This will enable the Thai people to better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this weapon of unparalleled spiritual power, and thus accelerate the Thai revolution towards final victory.
