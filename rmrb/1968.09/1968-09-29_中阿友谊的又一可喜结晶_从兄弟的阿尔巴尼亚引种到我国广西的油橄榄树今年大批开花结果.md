From brotherly Albania, olive trees have been introduced to Guangxi, and this year they have bloomed and borne fruit in large quantities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 27th: Over 1,500 olive trees introduced from brotherly Albania to the Sanmenjiang State Forest Farm have bloomed and borne fruit in large quantities this year under the careful cultivation and care of the farm workers. It is estimated that about 1,000 pounds of fruit can be harvested. The workers are currently picking the olives. This is another delightful fruit of Sino-Albanian friendship.

These friendship trees were introduced to this forest farm in February 1964. They are a precious gift from Chairman Shehu of the Albanian Council of Ministers to Premier Zhou Enlai. Over the years since their introduction, relevant scientific research institutions and the revolutionary workers of the forest farm have paid great attention to and cared for the growth of these fruit trees. They believe that cultivating and protecting the olive trees introduced from brotherly Albania is not just a general production task, but a significant matter that enhances the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. Therefore, the workers of the olive tree care specialist team at Sanmenjiang Forest Farm consider it a great honor to care for these olive trees. The team holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. To better care for these friendship fruit trees, they voluntarily moved to live near the olive grove, getting up early and working late, tirelessly and diligently cultivating and caring for the trees. Everyone has their own "experimental tree" and conducts various scientific experiments. Because of this, the olive saplings from brotherly Albania have successfully overcome various natural disasters such as drought, flooding, pests, and diseases, passing the survival and growth stages, and have settled down in our southern border. This batch of friendship fruit trees has over 1,200 trees blooming this year, and over 1,000 trees bearing fruit, with one tree yielding over 12 kilograms of fruit. Recently, the forest farm workers, with joyful hearts, have begun picking the fruit. It is understood that the harvested fruit, after being processed, tested, and experimented on by relevant departments, is excellent in color, aroma, taste, and quality, whether made into canned fruit or olive oil.

After the successful introduction of olive trees in Sanmenjiang Forest Farm, some counties and nearby rural people's communes in Guangxi have begun to actively introduce them.

    中阿友谊的又一可喜结晶
    从兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚引种到我国广西的油橄榄树今年大批开花结果
    据新华社南宁二十七日电　从兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚引种到广西三门江国营林场的一千五百多株油橄榄树，在林场职工精心培育护理下，今年大批开花结果，预计可收果实一千斤左右。现在，林场工人正在采摘。这是中阿友谊的又一个可喜的结晶。
    这批友谊果树，是一九六四年二月引种到这个林场的。它是阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志赠送给周恩来总理的珍贵礼物。引种这几年来，有关科学研究单位和林场的广大革命职工都十分重视和关怀这批果树的成长。他们认为，培育和护理好从兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚引种进来的油橄榄树，不是一般的生产任务，而是增进中阿两国人民革命的战斗友谊的大事。因此，三门江林场的油橄榄树护理专业班的工人们把护理好这批油橄榄树当作是自己莫大的幸福。这个专业班的工人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作。他们为了更好地就近护理好这批友谊果树，自动搬到油橄榄树园边居住，起早摸黑，不辞劳苦地精心进行培育和护理。人人都有自己的“试验树”，从事各种科学试验。正因为这样，这批来自兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚的油橄榄树幼苗，终于一次又一次地战胜了旱、涝、虫、病等各种自然灾害严重的侵袭，冲过了成活和生长两个大关，在我国的南疆“安家落户”了。这批友谊果树有一千二百多株在今年开了花，一千多株结了果，其中有一株结果已达十二公斤多。最近，林场工人满怀喜悦的心情，开始采果了。据了解，采下的果实经有关方面加工、测定、试验，不论是制成罐头果品还是橄榄油，色、香、味、质均好。
    油橄榄树在三门江林场引种成功后，广西的部分县和林场附近的农村人民公社已开始积极引种。
