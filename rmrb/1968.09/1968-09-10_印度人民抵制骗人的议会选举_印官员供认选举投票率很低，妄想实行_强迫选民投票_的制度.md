Indian officials admit that voter turnout is very low, and they fantasize about implementing a "mandatory voter" system.

New Delhi, September 6th—Indian reactionary government officials in charge of election affairs admitted in New Delhi on the 4th that in the parliamentary elections manipulated by the Indian reactionaries, bribery and fraud are extremely rampant, and the broad masses of the Indian people are boycotting these fraudulent elections.

According to the Indian Press Trust of India, the Indian "Chief Election Commissioner" named Seng-Wei'ermo admitted that in past elections in India, the voter turnout was far below 50%. This bureaucrat said that such a low voter turnout is a "mockery of the election." He absurdly proposed to implement a "mandatory voter" system.

According to Western news agencies, Seng-Wei'ermo advocates fining those who do not vote 50 rupees. This is equivalent to two months' living expenses for an impoverished Indian farmer. This shows how unpopular the election fraud of the Indian reactionary government is, and to what shameful extent this reactionary government is trying to squeeze the blood and sweat of the people.

Seng-Wei'ermo also admitted that in Indian elections, "bribery and fraud have shown no signs of stopping or decreasing." He revealed that certain parties, in order to attract votes, prepared vehicles for voters to ride to the polling stations for free, but the number of voters remained very low.

Indian revisionists have always stubbornly insisted on the "parliamentary road," advocating parliamentary elections, and helping the Indian reactionaries deceive the people. The confession of the Indian reactionary government officials in charge of election affairs exposes some of the scandals of Indian parliamentary elections and also reveals the treacherous nature of Indian revisionists.

    印度人民抵制骗人的议会选举
    印官员供认选举投票率很低，妄想实行“强迫选民投票”的制度
    新华社六日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府掌管选举事务的官员四日在新德里发表谈话，不打自招地供认，在印度反动派玩弄的议会选举中行贿舞弊现象非常严重，广大印度人民抵制这种骗人的选举。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，这个名叫森—维尔玛的印度“选举专员主任”供认，在印度过去历届选举中，投票率远远低于百分之五十。这个官僚说，投票的人这样少是“对选举的嘲弄”。他异想天开地提出要实行“强迫选民投票”的制度。
    据西方通讯社报道，森—维尔玛主张谁要是不投票，就罚他交五十卢比的罚金。这相当于印度一个贫苦农民两个月的生活费。这表明，印度反动政府的选举骗局多么不得人心，而这个反动政府想方设法榨取人民血汗到了多么可耻的程度。
    森—维尔玛还承认，在印度的选举中“行贿舞弊一点也没有停止或减少的迹象”。他透露，某些政党为了拉选票，准备了车辆让选民免费乘坐去投票站，但是投票的人仍然很少。
    印度修正主义分子一贯顽固坚持“议会道路”，鼓吹议会选举，帮助印度反动派欺骗人民。印度反动政府掌管选举事务的官员这篇供状，透露了印度议会选举的一点丑闻，也暴露了印度修正主义分子的帮凶嘴脸。
