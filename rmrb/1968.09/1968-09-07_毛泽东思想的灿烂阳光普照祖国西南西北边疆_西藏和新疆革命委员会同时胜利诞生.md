The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the southwest and northwest borders of the motherland. The revolutionary committees of Tibet and Xinjiang have been simultaneously and triumphantly established.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, just as the entire nation's hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians are advancing victoriously under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which are located on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front lines in China's southwest and northwest, have been simultaneously and triumphantly established. With this, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of the country, except for Taiwan Province. The entire nation is red! This signifies that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the country. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great event in the political life of China's 700 million people!

On September 5, Lhasa in the Tibetan Plateau and Urumqi at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains were both filled with festive scenes. The broad masses of military personnel and civilians, filled with the joy of victory, held red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands and surrounded the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding grand celebration meetings. People of all ethnic groups raised their arms and shouted: Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!
