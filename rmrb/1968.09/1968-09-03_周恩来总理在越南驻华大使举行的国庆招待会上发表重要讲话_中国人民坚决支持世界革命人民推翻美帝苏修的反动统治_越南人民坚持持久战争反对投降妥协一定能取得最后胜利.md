The Chinese people resolutely support the revolutionary peoples of the world in overthrowing the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Vietnamese people will definitely achieve final victory by persisting in a protracted war and opposing surrender and compromise.

"Soviet-Czechoslovakia Joint Statement" is the result of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism's attempt to redivide the world and their struggle and collusion over the Czechoslovakian issue.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, as always, resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end.

	Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Reception Held by Ambassador Vu Mingluan to Celebrate the 23rd Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

	Dear Comrade Ambassador Vu Mingluan,
	Dear Comrade Nguyen Van Khoa,
	Comrades and Friends,

	Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend our warmest congratulations to the government and the heroic people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	At present, the 31 million people of Vietnam, under the leadership and call of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, are waging a tenacious and arduous struggle against U.S. imperialism. The 14 million people of South Vietnam have successfully resisted 550,000 U.S. aggressors, nearly 600,000 puppet troops of the Saigon regime, and the mercenaries of U.S. imperialism, annihilating a large number of enemy forces and liberating four-fifths of South Vietnamese territory. The people of North Vietnam are strongly supporting the struggle of their compatriots in the South, achieving the glorious feat of shooting down more than 3,000 U.S. aircraft in the resistance against U.S. imperialist bombing. The victories of the Vietnamese people in their anti-U.S. national salvation war have made an important contribution to the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of the world.

	Comrades and Friends,

	The modern revisionist traitor clique of the Soviet Union, after invading and occupying Czechoslovakia, has now kidnapped the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership to Moscow and issued a so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovakian Joint Statement." This is a dirty deal made at the point of the bayonet, a big swindle to deceive the Czechoslovakian people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world.

	This so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovakian Joint Statement" further exposes the pretexts of the Soviet revisionists for their invasion, which are all lies. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique had just been swearing that the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership was the enemy of "socialism," but now they suddenly regard them as "socialist" allies. Is this not a laughable farce? This can only show that they are birds of a feather, and their quarrels are merely those between big dogs and small dogs. The fact is that in both the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the achievements of socialism have long been nullified, and the leaders of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique are the ones who are heading the restoration of capitalism and colluding with imperialism. The first to collude with West German revanchism was the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The one that acknowledged the legitimacy of Zionism in the Middle East was the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The one that enticed Japanese militarism to develop Siberia was the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The one that let the U.S. imperialist aircraft and invading troops into Soviet airspace and allowed them to massacre the people of South Vietnam was also the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. These few examples are enough to show that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a thoroughgoing traitor to socialism, the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against the world. In fact, it is precisely because the Soviet revisionist traitor clique insists on pursuing the revisionism of Khrushchev that the original socialist camp has long been destroyed by them, where is there still any talk of "defending the achievements of socialism" and "defending the socialist family"? The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, together with four follower countries, invaded a country with only 14 million people in just ten days, occupying it and suppressing the people there. To call this barbaric fascist aggression "aid in the name of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism" is a blatant betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and will forever be condemned by history. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique says one thing and does another. They are, as Lenin said, "socialists in words, imperialists in deeds," that is, "social-imperialists."

	The Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership, at the time of the massive Soviet invasion, openly called on the Czechoslovakian people not to resist; now, under the bayonet of the Soviet revisionists, they have knelt down and signed a "capitulation agreement" with the Soviet revisionists, becoming the Soviet revisionists' Quisling. They are traitors to the Czechoslovakian nation.

	This so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovakian Joint Statement" is the result of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists' attempt to redivide the world and their struggle and collusion over the Czechoslovakian issue. The U.S. imperialists, on the one hand, acknowledge that Czechoslovakia belongs to the sphere of influence of the Soviet revisionists and tacitly approve of the Soviet revisionists' invasion, while on the other hand, they repeatedly demand that the Soviet revisionists not act too hastily, so as not to affect the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists on a global scale. In sacrificing the interests of the Czechoslovakian people, the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the Czechoslovakian revisionists are completely in agreement.

	The Czechoslovakian incident is by no means an isolated incident. Since the U.S. imperialists acknowledge that Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe belong to the sphere of influence of the Soviet revisionists, the condition, of course, is that the Soviet revisionists acknowledge that the Middle East and South Vietnam, as well as Southeast Asia, belong to the sphere of influence of the U.S. imperialists. The Soviet revisionists will definitely continue to betray the Arab people and will definitely continue to betray the Vietnamese people. This is certain and beyond doubt.

	On the Vietnamese issue, for a long time, the Soviet revisionists have been pursuing a policy of fake support and real betrayal. In fact, the conspiracy for peace talks on Vietnam is the result of a joint plot by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists. After the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia, the U.S. imperialists' demands on the Vietnamese issue will inevitably increase, while the Soviet revisionists will only more firmly serve the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to divide the Vietnamese nation and occupy South Vietnam. Those who have illusions about the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists should wake up now!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The peoples of all countries, more than 90% of the total population, are the broad masses of the people who will inevitably make revolution and will inevitably support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will inevitably awaken and will inevitably oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and will inevitably oppose revisionism."

	The Chinese people resolutely support the peoples of Czechoslovakia, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the Arab countries, and all revolutionary peoples of the world in their struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys. We firmly believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of all countries will one day thoroughly bury U.S. imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists.

	Comrades and Friends,

	The current situation of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war is excellent. However, U.S. imperialism, in close collusion with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, will inevitably make desperate struggles. They will peddle more treacherous and cunning peace talks conspiracies, and they will launch more ruthless military adventures. Although the Vietnamese people will inevitably encounter various difficulties and twists and turns on their forward march, we firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, will be able to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war as long as they persist in a protracted war and oppose surrender and compromise. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, as always, resolutely support you to the end!

	Down with U.S. imperialism!
	Down with Soviet revisionism!
	Victory to the Vietnamese people!
	Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!
	Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho!
	Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，坚决支援英雄的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底
    新华社二日讯　国务院总理周恩来，今晚在吴明鸾大使举行的庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的吴明鸾大使同志，亲爱的阮文广团长同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年，我代表中国政府和中国人民，向越南民主共和国政府和英雄的越南人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    目前，三千一百万越南人民，在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导和号召下，正在同美帝国主义进行着艰苦顽强的战争。一千四百万越南南方人民，胜利地抗击了五十五万美国侵略军、近六十万的南越伪军和美帝仆从军队，消灭了敌人大量的有生力量，解放了五分之四的南越领土。越南北方人民，大力支援南方同胞的斗争，在抗击美帝国主义的轰炸中，取得了打下三千多架美国飞机的辉煌战果。越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利，为世界人民的反美斗争作出了重要的贡献。
    同志们，朋友们，
    苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团在出兵占领了捷克斯洛伐克以后，又劫持捷修领导集团去莫斯科，抛出了一个所谓“苏捷会谈公报”。这是在刺刀下达成的一笔肮脏交易，是愚弄捷克斯洛伐克人民、苏联人民和世界人民的一个大骗局。
    这个所谓“苏捷会谈公报”，进一步揭露了苏修出兵的借口，完全是骗人的谎话。苏修叛徒集团刚刚还信誓旦旦地把捷修领导集团骂之为“社会主义”的敌人，现在又忽然把他们看作是“社会主义”的盟友，岂非滑天下之大稽！这只能说明，他们本来就是一丘之貉，他们的争吵是大狗与小狗之间的争吵。事实是，无论在苏联或捷克斯洛伐克，社会主义成果都早已被勾消，而带头复辟资本主义、勾结帝国主义的，正是苏修叛徒集团自己。第一个同西德复仇主义勾结的是它。承认犹太复国主义在中东有合法地位的是它。勾引日本军国主义开发西伯利亚的是它。放走侵入苏联领空的美帝国主义的飞机和侵越官兵、让他们去屠杀南越人民的也是它。仅仅这几个例子就足以说明，苏修领导集团是地地道道的社会主义头号叛徒，是美帝侵略世界的头号帮凶。事实上，正是由于苏修叛徒集团坚持推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义，原来的社会主义阵营早已被它破坏得一干二净，哪里还谈得上什么“保卫社会主义成果”、“保卫社会主义大家庭”？苏修叛徒集团纠集四个追随国，十天之间出兵数十万，侵占一个只有一千四百万人口的所谓“同盟国”，去镇压那里的人民。把这种野蛮的法西斯侵略说成是马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的援助，这完全是明目张胆的对马克思列宁主义的叛变，它将永远地受到历史的谴责。苏修叛徒集团口头上说的是一套，实际上干的是另外一套。他们这一伙叛徒正如列宁所说的，是“口头上的社会主义者，实际上的帝国主义者”，也就是“社会帝国主义者”。
    捷修领导集团在苏军大举入侵的时候，公开号召捷克斯洛伐克人民不抵抗；现在，又在苏修刺刀下屈膝投降，同苏修签订了“城下之盟”，充当苏修的吉斯林。他们是捷克斯洛伐克民族的叛徒。
    这个所谓“苏捷会谈公报”是美苏妄图重新瓜分世界、在捷克斯洛伐克问题上又争夺又勾结的结果。美帝一方面承认捷克斯洛伐克属于苏修势力范围，默契苏修的出兵，另一方面又一再要求苏修不要操之过急，以免影响美苏在全球范围内的勾结。在牺牲捷克斯洛伐克人民利益这一点上，美帝、苏修、捷修完全是一致的。
    捷克斯洛伐克事件决不是一个孤立的事件。既然美帝承认捷克斯洛伐克乃至东欧是苏修的势力范围，其条件当然是苏修承认中东和南越乃至东南亚是美帝的势力范围。苏修一定要继续出卖阿拉伯人民，一定要继续出卖越南人民，这是肯定的、毫无疑义的。
    在越南问题上，长期以来，苏修就执行了假支持、真出卖的政策。实际上，关于越南的和谈阴谋，就是美帝和苏修共同策划的结果。在苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克事件发生之后，美帝在越南问题上的要价必然会提高，而苏修则只有更加死心塌地地为美帝分割越南民族、霸占越南南方的阴谋效劳。一切对于苏修、美帝抱有幻想的人，现在是猛醒的时候了！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”
    中国人民坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民、东欧人民、苏联人民、阿拉伯人民以及全世界一切革命人民起来进行斗争，推翻美帝、苏修及其走狗的反动统治。我们坚决相信，在马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，各国人民总有一天会把以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修为中心的现代修正主义彻底埋葬。
    同志们，朋友们，
    目前，越南人民抗美救国战争的形势大好。但是，美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团的密切配合下，一定还要作疯狂的挣扎。他们会兜售更加阴险狡猾的和谈阴谋，他们会进行更加穷凶极恶的军事冒险。尽管越南人民在前进的道路上，还会遇到各种困难和曲折，我们坚信，越南人民在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，只要坚持持久战争，反对投降妥协，就一定能够粉碎美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，坚决支援你们打到底！
    美帝必败！
    苏修必败！
    越南人民必胜！
    中越两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    越南人民的伟大领袖胡主席万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
