The Beijing Workers' Propaganda Team at Tsinghua University organized the two factions of the school to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. Many problems began to be solved, and the Tsinghua campus is taking on a new look.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: The Beijing Workers' Propaganda Team at Tsinghua University organized the two factions of Tsinghua University to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, fully exerting the political leadership of the working class.

Now, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held in every class and unit of Tsinghua University. The widespread holding of these classes has strengthened the proletarian political leadership of the workers' propaganda team over the school, mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and many problems have begun to be solved. The Tsinghua campus is taking on a new look. In the study classes, people are engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism to overcome bourgeois factionalism; in the study classes, they criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev and the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie; in the study classes, they expose and report a handful of class enemies who incite the masses to fight against the masses and sabotage the Cultural Revolution; in the study classes, they express their firm resolve to consolidate revolutionary great unity, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. Revolutionary teachers and students say: Holding study classes is good! The study classes are a revolutionary furnace where the working class uses great Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate us, a red fortress where the working class leads us to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and a stronghold where the working class leads us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution and create a new type of proletarian educational system!

From the first day they entered the school, the Beijing Workers' Propaganda Team at Tsinghua University has insisted on propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without deviation. They have used broadcasts, big-character posters, symposiums, and individual chats, and have formed hundreds of small teams to go deep into the classes, workshops, and dormitories of the teaching and administrative staff, extensively and meticulously carrying out propaganda and education work. Wherever they go, they spread Mao Zedong Thought and bring the exemplary role and fine style of the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They have been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction to "fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have even more trust and love for the workers' propaganda team. They actively seek out the workers' propaganda team to reflect various problems and put forward various demands, hoping that the workers' propaganda team will manage all big and small matters in the school. In this situation, the workers' propaganda team, with the urgent need to solve the "old and difficult" problems in Tsinghua University, seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and further realized that the workers' propaganda team must fully exert the leadership of the working class, which is to implement proletarian political leadership over the school. The most important thing is to ensure that every instruction of the great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao, and every order of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, can be quickly implemented. To thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "realizing the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class," deeply understand the spirit and essence of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything," and do a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. It is necessary to persist in using great Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the broad revolutionary teachers and students, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and in all work, highlight proletarian politics, and never take over or fall into bureaucratism. Based on this understanding, after promoting the revolutionary great unity of the two factions of Tsinghua University, the workers' propaganda team immediately followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in the study classes," and jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in every class and unit of the entire school, the workers of the propaganda team, using methods such as collective study and discussion with the school's teachers, students, and staff, individual chats, and sharing experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, extensively and deeply propagated Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, sending Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. Workers from many units such as the Beijing New China Printing Factory, Beijing Knitting General Factory, Beijing Transformer Factory, and Beijing First Construction Engineering Company of the propaganda team, especially paid attention to using their own deep proletarian feelings of unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely implementing every instruction of Chairman Mao, to influence and educate the revolutionary teachers and students. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Transformer Factory in the Automatic Control System class, at the beginning, some teachers and students, due to the influence of mountain-headism, individualism, and sectarianism, had some ideological resistance to implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "each making self-criticism" and related instructions on consolidating revolutionary great unity. At this time, the old workers of the Transformer Factory, who were split into two factions by the bourgeois reactionary line before achieving revolutionary great unity, spoke from their personal experiences, sharing how they followed Chairman Mao's instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity, immediately found the other side to actively check their own bourgeois factionalism, and quickly eliminated the mountains and united against the enemy. The teachers and students were deeply moved, and some immediately checked their past mistakes of not studying and not implementing Chairman Mao's instructions well, and learned from the examples of the worker comrades, actively finding the other side's classmates for heart-to-heart talks, mutually checking their own bourgeois factionalism, and quickly consolidated the revolutionary great unity of this class.

Based on the actual situation of Tsinghua, the workers' propaganda team listed the criticism of the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie as an important item in each Mao Zedong Thought study class. In addition to holding various criticism meetings, they also set up many big-character poster columns, combining specific examples of Tsinghua University, to help teachers, students, and staff recognize the various manifestations and serious harm of the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie, repeatedly educating teachers, students, and staff to more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their thinking, unify their steps, and unify their actions. Some old workers said: "We can only have one heart—eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, we can only have one center—everything serves the proletarian headquarters of Chairman Mao. We must not let bourgeois mountain-headism, individualism, and sectarianism confuse our minds and fall into the trap of the reactionary 'multi-center theory'!" Seeing the workers' big-character posters filled with loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and hearing the workers' earnest words, many teachers and students also rushed to write big-character posters or speak at criticism meetings, exposing the harm of the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie. Many revolutionary teachers and students excitedly expressed that in the future, they would read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, with unchanging hearts even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble!

To raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among revolutionary teachers and students, the workers' propaganda team carried out the "three remembrances, three comparisons, and three examinations" activities in each Mao Zedong Thought study class. The "three remembrances, three comparisons, and three examinations" are: remembering the bitterness of the old society, comparing the sweetness of the new society, and examining one's class stance; remembering the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, comparing the brilliance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and examining one's performance in the struggle between the two lines; remembering the cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao, comparing one's loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and examining whether one always follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Jingan Mountain United Committee of Tsinghua University, which was attended by the former leaders of the two factions, the workers' propaganda team organized the members of the study class to listen to reports on remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness and to eat bitter meals. The old workers from the Beijing Switch Factory participating in the propaganda team, holding a bowl of sorghum and vegetable porridge, recalled their family history of blood and tears in the old society, talked about their happy life in the new society, angrily criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev, and sang praises to the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless kindness and great achievements. The revolutionary workers who prepared the bitter meal said to these leaders of the mass organizations: "You eat this meal, and you must never forget the sufferings of the laboring people in the old society, and you must always remember the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines! After eating this meal, you must forever follow Chairman Mao and be revolutionary to the end without changing your heart!" Eating the bitter meal and listening to the workers' earnest advice, many former leaders of the two factions shouted in unison: "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood revenge!" "Down with China's Khrushchev!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" One leader, due to the serious influence of bourgeois factionalism, had done things that did not distinguish between enemies and friends, protecting class enemies who had infiltrated his faction. He listened to the reports on remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness and ate the bitter meal, feeling more and more that he had let down the great leader Chairman Mao and the workers and poor peasants, and in the study class, he cried bitterly and checked his mistakes. Many people also fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism in the "three remembrances, three comparisons, and three examinations" activities, expressing their determination to always remember the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly overcome bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie, unite against the enemy, and under the leadership of the working class, carry the Cultural Revolution of Tsinghua University through to the end!

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the necessity of working-class leadership for the proletarian educational revolution and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything" were published, the workers' propaganda team had a clearer understanding and more conscious actions in fully exerting the political leadership of the working class. They targeted the active thoughts of the teachers, students, and staff, taking the further improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as an important way to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. In addition to studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and other documents with revolutionary teachers and students in the study classes, the revolutionary workers from the Beijing First General Machinery Factory of the propaganda team also organized more than 100 revolutionary teachers and students from the Metallurgy Department's Mao Zedong Thought study class to visit their factory and participate in the on-site criticism meeting of a handful of reactionary technical "authorities." The so-called "experts" and "authorities" who were criticized in the workshop were considered very "learned" by some intellectuals, but the workers exposed these politically reactionary guys with iron facts, showing that they were nothing but paper tigers in science and technology. The technical innovation projects that the reactionary technical "authorities" had been working on for many years in the laboratory were now completed one by one by the revolutionary workers. These facts had a great impact on the revolutionary teachers and students, making them further understand the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao that "intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing." After returning to school, the revolutionary teachers and students, with the education they received at the Beijing First General Machinery Factory, enthusiastically discussed the great significance of the working class leading the school in the study classes, and some study classes also combined to criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of their own department. The revolutionary teachers and students excitedly said: The working class must lead everything, the working class can lead everything! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, under the leadership of the working class, resolutely take the road of combining with the workers and peasants, and quickly catch up with the majestic steps of the billion revolutionary people marching forward to victory.

    充分发挥工人阶级在政治上的领导作用  坚持用伟大的毛泽东思想教育革命师生
    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，组织学校两派群众普遍联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，调动了广大革命师生员工的积极性，很多问题开始得到解决，清华园正在呈现出崭新的面貌
    新华社十日讯　首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，组织清华大学两派群众普遍联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助广大革命师生员工认真学习、坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，充分发挥了工人阶级在政治上的领导作用。
    现在，毛泽东思想学习班遍及清华大学的各个班级、各个单位。学习班的普遍举办，加强了工人宣传队对学校的无产阶级政治领导，调动了广大革命师生员工的革命积极性，很多问题开始得到解决，清华园里正在呈现出崭新的面貌。人们在学习班里斗私批修，克服资产阶级派性；在学习班里批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，批判资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”；在学习班里揭发、检举一小撮挑动群众斗群众、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人；在学习班里表达巩固革命大联合、认真搞好斗、批、改和誓把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的坚强决心。革命师生们说：办学习班就是好！学习班是工人阶级用伟大的毛泽东思想对我们进行再教育的革命熔炉，是工人阶级领导我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、落实毛主席一系列最新指示的红色堡垒，是工人阶级带领我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利、创建新型的无产阶级教育制度的坚强阵地！
    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，从进校的第一天起，就坚持宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示不转向。他们通过广播、大字报、座谈会和个别谈心等方式，并且组成上百支小分队，深入到班级、车间和教职员工的宿舍，广泛而深入细致地开展宣传教育工作。他们走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里，就把用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级的模范作用和优良作风带到哪里，受到了全校革命师生员工的热烈欢迎。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示以后，革命师生员工对工人宣传队更加信任，更加热爱。他们主动找工人宣传队反映各种问题，提出各种要求，希望工人宣传队把学校里大大小小的事都管起来。在这种情况下，工人宣传队带着清华大学迫切需要解决的“老大难”问题，认真学习了毛主席的有关指示，进一步认识到，工人宣传队要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，就是要对学校实行无产阶级的政治领导。最重要的问题，是要保证工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席的每一个指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个号令，都能够迅速得到贯彻执行。要切实落实毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”的最新指示，深刻领会姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》的精神实质，搞好学校的斗、批、改。必须坚持用伟大的毛泽东思想对广大革命师生进行再教育，充分调动广大革命师生员工的积极性，在各项工作中突出无产阶级政治，而决不能包办代替，陷于事务主义。根据这样的认识，工人宣传队在促进清华大学两派群众实现革命大联合以后，便立即遵照毛主席的“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，和革命师生员工们共同举办毛泽东思想学习班。
    在全校各班级、各单位的毛泽东思想学习班上，宣传队的工人们，采用同学校师生员工集体学习讨论、个别谈心、介绍贯彻执行毛主席指示的体会等方式，广泛、深入地宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，把毛泽东思想送到革命师生员工的心里。宣传队中的北京新华印刷厂、北京针织总厂、北京变压器厂、北京市第一建筑工程公司等许多单位的革命职工，特别注意运用他们自己无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，和紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、坚决落实毛主席每一个指示的亲身感受，去影响和教育革命师生员工。在北京变压器厂革命职工负责举办的自控系一个班的毛泽东思想学习班上，开始，部分师生由于山头主义、个人主义、宗派主义的影响，对于贯彻执行毛主席的“各自多做自我批评”和有关巩固革命大联合的指示，有一定的思想阻力。这时，变压器厂在实现革命大联合前被资产阶级反动路线分裂成两派的老工人，就现身说法，讲述他们怎样遵照毛主席关于实现革命大联合的指示，立即找对方主动检查自己的资产阶级派性，迅速铲平山头、团结对敌的经历。师生们听了很受感动，有些人立即对照检查了自己过去对毛主席的指示没有很好学习和学而不用的错误态度，并且学习工人同志的榜样，主动找对方的同学谈心，互相检查自己的资产阶级派性，结果很快巩固了这个班的革命大联合。
    工人宣传队根据清华园的实际情况，把批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”列为各个毛泽东思想学习班的一项重要内容。他们除了举行各种批判会以外，还办起了许多大字报专栏，结合清华大学的具体事例，帮助师生员工认识资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”的各种表现和它的严重危害，反复教育师生员工要更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。有的老工人说：“我们只能有一个心眼——永远忠于毛主席，我们只能有一个中心——一切服从毛主席的无产阶级司令部。万万不能让资产阶级山头主义、个人主义、宗派主义迷了心窍，上了反动的‘多中心论’的当啊！”看看工人们一张张充满着对伟大领袖毛主席一片忠心的大字报，听听工人们语重心长的讲话，不少师生员工也赶写大字报或者在批判会上发言，控诉反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”对自己的毒害。许多革命师生激动地表示，今后读书要读毛主席的书，听话要听毛主席的话，要永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂不变心！
    为了提高革命师生员工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，工人宣传队在各个毛泽东思想学习班上普遍开展了“三忆三比三查”活动。“三忆三比三查”是：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，查自己的阶级立场；忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大，查自己在两条路线斗争中的表现；忆党和毛主席对自己的培养，比对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心，查自己是否始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。在由原来两派群众组织头头参加的清华大学井冈山大联委毛泽东思想学习班上，工人宣传队就多次组织学习班的成员听忆苦思甜报告和吃忆苦饭，看忆苦戏。参加宣传队的北京开关厂的老工人在吃忆苦饭的时候，手捧糠菜窝头，回忆自己在旧社会血泪斑斑的家史，讲述自己在新社会的幸福生活，愤怒地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行，满怀深情地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的无限恩情和丰功伟绩。做忆苦饭的革命职工，向这些群众组织的头头们说：“你们吃下这顿饭，千万不要忘记劳动人民在旧社会受的苦难，要牢牢记住阶级斗争和两条路线斗争！吃了这顿饭，你们要永远紧跟毛主席，革命到底不变心！”吃着忆苦饭，听着工人同志的谆谆嘱咐，原来两派群众组织的不少头头连连高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”有个头头由于严重的资产阶级派性作怪，曾经做出了敌我不分、保护混入自己那一派组织的阶级敌人的事来。他听了忆苦思甜报告、吃了忆苦饭，越想越觉得自己对不起伟大领袖毛主席，对不起工人和贫下中农，在学习班上痛哭流涕地检查了自己的错误。许多人都在“三忆三比三查”活动中斗私批修，表示一定要念念不忘阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，彻底克服资产阶级派性，彻底肃清反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”的流毒，团结对敌，在工人阶级领导下，把清华大学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席关于实现无产阶级教育革命必须有工人阶级领导的最新指示和姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》发表以后，工人宣传队在充分发挥工人阶级的政治领导作用方面，认识更加明确，行动更加自觉。他们针对师生员工中的活思想，把进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班，当作紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、落实毛主席一系列最新指示的重要途径。宣传队中北京第一通用机械厂的革命职工，除了在学习班上同革命师生一起学习毛主席的最新指示和其他文件以外，还组织冶金系毛泽东思想学习班的一百多名革命师生到本厂参观，并且参加对一小撮反动技术“权威”的现场批判会。被揪到车间接受批判的几个所谓“专家”、“权威”，在某些知识分子的眼里都是很有“学问”的人物，但是工人们却用铁的事实揭露出这几个政治上反动的家伙，在科学技术上也不过是徒有虚名的纸老虎。过去反动技术“权威”在实验室里搞了多少年还是一事无成的技术革新项目，现在被革命职工一个又一个地完成了。这些事实，对革命师生们震动很大，使他们对毛主席指出的“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”这一伟大真理，有了进一步的理解。革命师生们返校以后，带着在北京第一通用机械厂受到的教育，在学习班上热烈讨论工人阶级领导学校的伟大意义，有的学习班还结合批判了本系的反动学术“权威”。革命师生们激动地说：工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够领导一切！我们一定要听毛主席的话，在工人阶级领导下，坚决走与工农群众相结合的道路，迅速赶上亿万革命人民胜利前进的雄伟步伐。
