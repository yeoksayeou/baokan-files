The Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently held a political border defense conference. During the conference, the soldiers and militia representatives of the coastal defense units repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on building political border defense. They summarized and exchanged experiences in building political border defense, and resolved to build the country's border defense even better.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: In the favorable situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently held a political border defense conference to further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and thoroughly carry out Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on building political border defense. The soldiers and militia representatives of the coastal defense units who attended the conference resolved, together with the broad masses of the people, to build the coastal defense front into an iron wall to defend the motherland and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Vice Chairman Lin creatively applied the great commander Mao Zedong's principles of political military construction. In strengthening border defense, he issued important instructions on building political border defense. Over the past few years, the soldiers of the coastal defense units of the Guangzhou Military Region, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have resolutely implemented Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on building political border defense, achieving brilliant results. Now, the coastal defense regions of South China have widely popularized Mao Zedong Thought, greatly raised awareness of the two-line struggle between the military and the people, achieved great unity between the military and the people, developed the socialist economy, and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. The border defense soldiers and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have fought shoulder to shoulder, foiling the sabotage plots of domestic and foreign class enemies time and time again, making the border a true iron wall, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution amidst the frenzied anti-China clamor of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is a real iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who genuinely support the revolution." The soldiers fighting on the long border lines, in the process of implementing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on building political border defense, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, deeply realizing that relying on the masses, the border can become an iron wall. They inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of our army of "propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses," going to the masses, carrying out activities of "platoons helping production teams, squads helping brigades, and 'one red' helping households." Officers and soldiers mobilized together, and the masses did the work for the masses. The soldiers, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the two-line struggle in the border regions, armed the people with Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a thorough criticism of the reactionary line, through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, clay sculptures exhibitions, and on-site denunciations, thoroughly exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in restoring capitalism, and highly praising the greatness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the masses, making them more consciously defend the motherland and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The soldiers regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental duty of the army in doing mass work, with the fastest speed and greatest enthusiasm, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The "Steel Eighth Company of the South China Seas" propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the islanders, achieving immediate propagation without delay and propagation without omission. Last year on National Day, they listened to Vice Chairman Lin's transmission of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and the officers and soldiers immediately propagated it to the masses at night, and together with the masses, held struggle meetings to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, quickly launching the mass movement of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism throughout the island. A certain unit's line maintenance company was scattered in several counties on duty, and together with the masses, held over 200 Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Some stations had only two soldiers, but together with the masses, held nine study classes. A certain garrison company's Sixth Company, despite its heavy duty, still received 19,000 Red Guards and revolutionary masses, sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate to 75,000 masses, and with three counties' 25 communes and over 40 middle schools, held 68 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helped four communes establish revolutionary committees, and promoted the great alliance of eight middle schools.

Due to the serious implementation of Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on building political border defense, although the troops are highly dispersed, the tasks are heavy, the environment is harsh, and the struggle is complex, the revolutionary construction of the border defense troops is getting better day by day. On the long border lines, the soldiers launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. They studied one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticized revisionism once, examined bourgeois ideology once, combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism, studying Chairman Mao's works every day, criticizing revisionism every day, turning the sharp and complex class struggle battlefield into a classroom for raising class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. For many years, the soldiers stationed on small islands far from the mainland or in misty high mountain sentry posts, took the two-line struggle education as the central link of all education in the troops, closely linking their battle positions with defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, regarding loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the highest criterion for measuring all words and deeds. There is a high mountain sentry post where one has to climb over five mountain peaks, turn 74 bends, and climb 5,600 steps from the foot of the mountain to this sentry post. Food and daily necessities all have to be carried up the mountain on shoulders. However, because they regarded the observation platform as a battlefield to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the observation telescope as the thousand-mile eye of the proletarian headquarters, no matter how harsh the environment, how bad the weather, or how complex the struggle, they always stood firm, withstood the test, saw clearly, and were strong, becoming Chairman Mao's red sentries. They proudly said: "Eyes looking at Beijing, walking on high mountains as if on flat roads, hearts thinking of Chairman Mao, stepping on thousands of difficulties underfoot!" Because the various levels of party committees of the border defense troops insisted on highlighting proletarian politics, placing the cultivation of "three loyalties" battle collectives and "three loyalties" revolutionary soldiers at the forefront of troop revolutionary construction, therefore, in the past two years, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, new advanced companies, sentry posts, and checkpoints have continuously emerged. There is a certain unit's line maintenance company that performed duties on a thousand-mile line, achieving "people dispersed but hearts united, environment complex but hearts pure"; there is a certain unit's Thirteenth Company that firmly guarded the southern border of the motherland, facing fierce winds and waves unshakably, and facing the "fragrant wind" of capitalism untainted; there is a certain unit's Sixth Company that enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, achieving "wherever they go, a red line, wherever they live, a red piece"; and there are certain sentry posts and island garrison teams that have been guarding high mountains and islands for many years, standing on the front line of class struggle, achieving "honoring hardship, consciously standing guard and keeping watch for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line"; and there is the Longbang Central Work Station that, with the revolutionization of the party committee itself, promoted the revolutionization of the entire station and the entire defense area's masses.

During the conference, the border defense troops and militia representatives who attended the conference repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on building political border defense, summarized and exchanged experiences in building political border defense, and resolved to even higher hold up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and build the country's border defense even better.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗把海边防建设成钢铁长城
    解放军广州部队召开政治边防会议。会议期间，海边防部队指战员和民兵代表们反复学习了毛主席的人民战争思想和林副主席建设政治边防的重要指示，总结交流了建设政治边防的经验，决心把祖国的边防建设得好上加好
    新华社广州电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，人民解放军广州部队最近召开政治边防会议，进一步落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，深入贯彻林副主席关于建设政治边防的重要指示。参加会议的海边防部队指战员和民兵代表，决心和广大人民群众一起把海防前线建设成为保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城。
    林副主席创造性地运用伟大统帅毛主席政治建军的原则，在加强边防问题上，发出了建设政治边防的重要指示。几年来，广州部队海边防部队广大指战员，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，坚决贯彻落实林副主席建设政治边防的重要指示，取得了辉煌成果。现在，祖国南海边防地区毛泽东思想大普及，军民两条路线斗争觉悟大提高，军民大团结，社会主义经济大发展，无产阶级专政大加强。用毛泽东思想武装起来的边防军民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，并肩战斗，一次又一次地粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，使边防成了真正的铜墙铁壁，保卫着无产阶级文化大革命在帝、修、反疯狂反华的鼓噪声中胜利进行。
    毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”战斗在漫长边防线上的广大指战员，在贯彻落实林副主席建设政治边防指示的过程中，反复学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，深刻认识到：依靠群众，边防就能成为铜墙铁壁。他们继承和发扬我军“宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众”的光荣传统，到群众中去，开展“连帮防区，班排帮生产队，‘一对红’帮到户”的活动，干部战士齐动员，群众工作群众做。广大指战员紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓边防地区两条路线的斗争，用毛泽东思想武装人民群众，发动群众深入开展革命大批判，通过忆苦思甜、泥塑展览、现场控诉，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大颂特颂毛主席革命路线的英明伟大，使广大群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加自觉地保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级专政。指战员们把宣传毛泽东思想看成是部队做群众工作最根本的职责，以最快的速度，最大的热情，宣传毛主席的最新指示。“南海前哨钢八连”向岛上群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，做到了紧跟不过夜，宣传不漏人。去年国庆节，他们收听到林副主席传达的毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，干部战士连夜向群众广泛宣传，并和群众一起学习，一起召开斗私批修讲用会，迅速在全岛开展了斗私批修的群众运动。某部线路维护连分散在几个县执勤，和群众一起办了二百多期毛泽东思想学习班，有的站只有两个战士，也和群众一起办了九期学习班。某守备部队六连担负着繁重的执勤任务，仍接待了红卫兵和革命群众一万九千多人次，派出毛泽东思想宣传队宣传群众七万五千多人次，与三个县的二十五个公社、四十多所中小学办了六十八期毛泽东思想学习班，帮助四个公社成立了革命委员会，促进八所中学实现了革命大联合。
    由于认真执行林副主席建设政治边防的重要指示，虽然部队高度分散，任务繁重，环境艰苦，斗争复杂，但是边防部队的革命化建设一天比一天好。在漫长的边防线上，广大指战员掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。他们学一条毛主席语录，批一次修正主义，查一次资产阶级思想，把斗私和批修紧紧结合起来，天天学习毛主席著作，天天批判修正主义，把尖锐复杂的阶级斗争现场，变成了提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的课堂。长年驻守在远离大陆的小岛或云雾弥漫的高山哨所里，指战员们把两条路线斗争教育作为部队一切教育的中心环节，把自己的战斗岗位与保卫毛主席，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线紧紧联系在一起，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线作为衡量一切言行的最高准则。有一个高山哨所从山脚到这个哨所要翻越五个山头，转七十四道弯，攀登五千六百多阶梯，吃的用的都要肩挑上山。但是由于他们把观察台看作是捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗岗位，把观察镜看作是无产阶级司令部的千里眼，不管环境如何艰苦，气候如何恶劣，斗争如何复杂，他们始终作到了“站得稳，顶得住，看得清，过得硬”，人人成为毛主席的红哨兵。他们豪迈地说：“眼睛望着北京城，高山当作平路行，心里想着毛主席，千重困难踩脚底！”由于边防部队的各级党委坚持突出无产阶级政治，把培养“三忠于”的战斗集体和“三忠于”的革命战士摆到了部队革命化建设的首位，因此，两年来，在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，新的先进连队、哨所、站卡不断涌现。有在千里线路上执勤，做到了“人员分散心不散，环境复杂心不杂”的某部线路维护连；有坚守祖国南部边境线、迎着狂风恶浪不动摇、面对资本主义“香风”永不沾的某部十三连；有热情向群众宣传毛泽东思想，做到了“走到那里红一线，住在那里红一片”的某部六连；以及长年守卫在高山、海岛上，站在阶级斗争最前线，做到了以艰苦为荣，自觉为保卫毛主席的革命路线站好岗、放好哨的某哨所和某岛守备队；还有以党委自身革命化带动全站和全防区群众革命化的龙邦中心工作站等。
    在会议期间，参加会议的边防部队和民兵代表，反复学习了毛主席的人民战争思想和林副主席建设政治边防的重要指示，总结交流了建设政治边防的经验，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把祖国的边防建设得好上加好。
