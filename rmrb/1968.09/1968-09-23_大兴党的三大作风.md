The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, has achieved a red sun rising over the entire land. The working class, as the main force, has taken the stage of all superstructures, and the People's Liberation Army serves as a solid rear guard. The revolutionary mass movement is accelerating its steps toward complete victory.

The issue of work style is extremely important for us to consolidate and develop our victories.

The three great styles of work personally fostered by Chairman Mao—combining theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and practicing self-criticism—have played a powerful revolutionary role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have ensured the smooth implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is also a great victory of the Party's three great styles of work.

Now, hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians are fighting under the leadership of the working class to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Criticizing and reforming bourgeois ideology and work styles is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and it is also an important and indispensable part of struggle, criticism, and transformation. As struggle, criticism, and transformation deepen, the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews and work styles will inevitably become more profound and sharper. A handful of class enemies will also use bourgeois work styles in their desperate struggles.

Intellectuals receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers must use the three great styles of work that embody the class nature of the working class as weapons to seriously eliminate the poisoning of bourgeois educational lines on their work styles. The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary youth must grow healthily according to Chairman Mao's requirements for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They must also inherit the Party's fine traditions, use the Party's three great styles of work to educate, temper, and arm themselves.

Therefore, promoting the Party's three great styles of work, using the style of combining theory with practice to overcome the style of inconsistency between words and deeds, using the style of maintaining close ties with the masses to overcome various tendencies of alienation from the masses, especially the tendency of sectarianism, and using the style of self-criticism to overcome the style of covering up mistakes, has become one of our important tasks. This not only has great practical significance for achieving complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also has far-reaching strategic significance for preventing capitalist restoration and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The close combination of theory and practice is one of the most distinctive features that distinguish us Communists from all other political parties."

Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest revolutionary theory of our time. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are the guiding beacons leading the people of the entire country from one victory to another. The most important thing in combining theory with practice is to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions step by step, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments closely, and never deviate from them.

Whether to follow closely or not reflects two fundamentally different styles of work. Inconsistency between words and deeds, hypocrisy, and duplicity are bourgeois styles of work. Learning and applying what one learns, putting into practice what one learns, and saying what one does are the styles of work we should advocate.

For Chairman Mao's instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters, we must first study them seriously. We must study for revolutionary practice. We must not only learn quickly but also strive to learn well and deeply understand. We must study continuously and repeatedly as the situation changes. If studying is not for guiding revolutionary practice but for other purposes, it is impossible to understand correctly and truly learn, and actions will deviate from the track indicated by Chairman Mao.

Bourgeois ideology always stubbornly manifests itself and opposes Chairman Mao's instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters. To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments closely, we must engage in ideological struggles and resolutely discard everything that contradicts them. It is useless to touch only the surface without touching one's soul. Only by turning verbal following into actual following can we truly combine theory with practice.

Implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, for all levels of leadership, must be swift and decisive, creating a great momentum. However, following this, we must focus on implementation. We must do a lot of ideological and organizational work in a down-to-earth manner according to specific situations. This is even more important and arduous work. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "To turn the Party's line into the masses' line, we need long-term, unyielding, arduous, and patient efforts that do not fear trouble. Without such efforts, nothing will succeed."

Great teacher Chairman Mao always teaches us that theory must be combined with practice. When we study Mao Zedong Thought, we must never forget this most important teaching of Chairman Mao. The old educational system has made many intellectuals prone to a common illness: theory and practice are disconnected, they talk more and do less, and they are Marxists towards others but liberalists towards themselves. If things go wrong, they may even slip into the path of hypocrisy, deceit, and playing both sides. We must seriously help intellectuals and Red Guards establish the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, grasp the policy of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, and guide them to work hard on putting theory into practice.

Vice Chairman Lin points out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue." Whether theory and practice are combined or separated is the fundamental issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Every warrior who is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line should advocate the style of closely combining theory with practice and resolutely fight against the empty talk and two-faced style of inconsistency between words and deeds.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Another distinctive feature that distinguishes us Communists from all other political parties is that we maintain the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people."

Maintaining close ties with the broadest masses of the people, mobilizing all positive factors, and turning as many negative factors as possible into positive ones is determined by the class nature of the working class. Because "the proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all of humanity. If it cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated." Sectarianism, factionalism, subjectivism, bureaucratism, and other tendencies of alienation from the masses are incompatible with the Party nature and mass line of the proletariat.

To achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, under the leadership of the working class, unite the broad masses, mainly the peasant masses, urban petty-bourgeois masses, and intellectuals who can be reformed, and concentrate on striking down a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Uniting more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres is the policy of the proletariat and is also an issue that must be paid attention to in the current stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin says: "The entire Party and the people of the whole country must unite around Chairman Mao as the center and unite around Mao Zedong Thought as the center." Maintaining close ties with the masses fundamentally means using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the masses, uniting the broadest masses of the people around the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, and fighting for the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. If this is not done, it will violate the fundamental interests of the masses and thus fundamentally alienate from the masses.

The masses harbor immense socialist enthusiasm. When the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation arrives, it is especially important to promote the style of investigation and research and the style of focusing on typical examples. All levels of leadership must insist on the working method advocated by Chairman Mao of going to the masses and coming from the masses. For the good thoughts, methods, and experiences of the masses, we must discover them in a timely manner, support them boldly, summarize them seriously, and promote them enthusiastically. Without focusing on typical examples and vigorously promoting positive factors, we cannot effectively educate the masses and guide them to advance along the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao.

When some Red Guards and revolutionary masses make mistakes, do not despise them. We must insist on principles, clearly propose criticisms, and adopt an attitude of educating and protecting the masses with full enthusiasm. At any time, we must affirm the achievements of the masses, cherish the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, believe that the majority of the masses want to make revolution with Chairman Mao, and believe that the majority or most intellectuals can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our responsibility is to do a lot of patient and detailed ideological and political work to raise their awareness, help them recognize their mistakes, and actively help them overcome and correct them, uniting them to move forward together.

Differences of opinion among the people are always present. This is a contradiction based on the unity of fundamental interests. A true proletarian revolutionary must act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups, not only uniting with those who agree with oneself but also being good at uniting with those who disagree with oneself, and being good at uniting with those who have opposed oneself and have been proven wrong by practice. Those who agree with one's views are treated as good people, and those who disagree with one's views are all excluded. This is the style of sectarianism and must be firmly opposed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the most distinctive features that distinguish us from other parties."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to overthrow a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all class enemies, and at the same time to reform people's worldviews. Self-criticism is the only correct method for revolutionary people to reform themselves. Only by constantly regarding oneself as the object of revolution and engaging in self-criticism can one follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step and forever be the driving force of the revolution.

A revolutionary doing some good deeds for the people is a duty. If there are any merits, they should be attributed to our great leader Chairman Mao, to the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao as the head, to the Central Military Commission and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and to the broad masses of the people. If one makes a mistake, one should engage in self-criticism and correct it resolutely. This is a manifestation of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and a manifestation of responsibility to the people. If corrected, wrongs turn into rights, and mistakes turn into correctness.

Vice Chairman Lin says: "Revolution also means revolting against oneself. If one does not revolt against oneself, the revolution will not succeed." Why did some comrades, who made contributions to the people in the early and middle stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, later fall behind or even make mistakes? One of the most important reasons is that they could not use the dialectical method of analysis to recognize themselves, lacked self-criticism, and relaxed self-revolution. What a profound lesson this is!

As struggle, criticism, and transformation deepen, the struggle between the proletarian "public" and the bourgeois "private" enters the 200-meter zone, engaging in close combat. This requires us to further raise our awareness of self-criticism. All comrades determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end must regard Chairman Mao's instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters as the highest guiding principles for their actions and examine themselves frequently. If it conforms to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, it should be vigorously promoted. If it deviates from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, it is the biggest error, the biggest selfishness, and the biggest disloyalty to Chairman Mao, and it must be subjected to serious, not perfunctory, self-criticism and be resolutely eliminated.

All exploiting classes cannot engage in self-criticism. Because they do not have truth, they do not have the masses, and once they engage in self-criticism, they will collapse. One of the evil consequences of the bourgeois educational system for intellectuals is self-righteousness, arrogance, and covering up mistakes. Some people, once they do something right, think they are always correct and lie on their record of merits without progressing further. These comrades should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "use the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening learning to reform themselves to meet the needs of the Party and the revolution."

Recently, great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle."

Self-criticism embodies the spirit of thorough revolution and is a unique characteristic of the working class. To push human society towards the ideal realm of communism, the working class always proposes the magnificent task of reforming the objective world and, at the same time, reforms its subjective world in the struggle. In the great revolutionary struggle, is there a proletarian revolutionary who does not engage in self-criticism? No, there never has been. Comrades, Red Guards, you should all humbly learn from the working class and forever be fighters with the spirit of self-criticism, bravely correcting mistakes and shortcomings.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle between different thoughts within the Party is constantly occurring. This is the reflection within the Party of the class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in society."

In the history of our Party, there has always been a struggle between two styles of work. In 1942, Chairman Mao personally led the great rectification movement of historic significance, overcoming various non-proletarian styles of work that existed within the Party at that time, uniting and educating the entire Party and the people of the whole country, and ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

In the socialist period, the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois styles of work is an important aspect of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Great leader Chairman Mao, as early as the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, called on the entire Party to maintain and carry forward the Party's fine traditions to overcome the bourgeoisie. Since the founding of the nation, Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, greatly enriching and developing the Party's fine traditions in theory and practice, and ensuring that our country advances along the path of socialism and communism.

The greatest capitalist-roader within the Party, China's Khrushchev, has long promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, resisting the Party's three great styles of work personally fostered by Chairman Mao, peddling the decadent styles of work from Confucius to Chiang Kai-shek of the feudal and bourgeois classes, attempting to corrupt our class, our Party, and our country, and achieve the evil goal of restoring capitalism.

Now, the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by China's Khrushchev has been thoroughly smashed. However, as Lenin pointed out: "When the old society is dying, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." The styles of work of inconsistency between words and deeds, sectarianism, and covering up mistakes are precisely the stench emanating from the political corpse of the bourgeoisie represented by China's Khrushchev. We must carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism to sweep all these bad things into the garbage heap of history.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, has always been a model of the Party's three great styles of work. To adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fully play the mighty role of the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must further strengthen the construction of our army's styles of work. Every old soldier in our army should consciously carry forward and spread the Party's three great styles of work. Every new soldier should strive to learn and inherit the Party's three great styles of work, making them shine from generation to generation. All officers and soldiers of the army should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be models of combining theory with practice, models of maintaining close ties with the masses, and models of self-criticism. Together with the people of the whole country, under the strong leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, we will strive forward to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    大兴党的三大作风
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉指引下，实现了全国山河一片红。工人阶级主力军登上了一切上层建筑的舞台，人民解放军做坚强的后盾。革命群众运动正在加快步伐向全面胜利推进。
    作风问题，对于我们巩固胜利和发展胜利，是一个极端重要的问题。
    毛主席亲自培育的党的三大作风，“理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风”，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，发挥了强大的革命威力，有力地保证了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的顺利贯彻。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，也是党的三大作风的伟大胜利。
    现在，亿万军民正在工人阶级领导下，为完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务而斗争。对资产阶级思想作风的批判和改造，是顺利进行斗、批、改的重要保证，也是斗、批、改的一项不可忽视的重要内容。随着斗、批、改的深入发展，无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观、两种思想作风的斗争，必然会更加深刻，更加尖锐。一小撮阶级敌人也还会利用资产阶级作风进行垂死挣扎。
    知识分子接受工农兵的再教育，必须用体现了工人阶级阶级本质的三大作风为武器，认真肃清资产阶级教育路线在思想作风方面对自己的毒害。广大红卫兵小将和革命青年，要按照毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的要求健康地成长，也必须继承党的优良传统，用党的三大作风教育自己，锻炼自己，武装自己。
    因此，大兴党的三大作风，用理论联系实际的作风去克服言行不一的作风，用密切联系群众的作风去克服脱离群众的种种倾向特别是山头主义的作风，用自我批评的作风去克服文过饰非的作风，就成为我们的一项重要任务。这不仅对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利有巨大的现实意义，而且对于防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政，有着深远的战略意义。
    毛主席教导我们：“理论和实践这样密切地相结合，是我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的显著标志之一。”
    毛泽东思想是我们这个时代最伟大的革命理论。毛主席一系列最新指示，是引导全国人民从胜利走向胜利的指路明灯。理论和实践相结合，最重要的，就是要条条落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，步步紧跟，寸步不离。
    紧跟还是不紧跟，反映了两种根本不同的作风。讲的和做的互相矛盾，言行不一，表里不一，这是资产阶级的作风。学用一致，学一点用一点，说到做到，不放空炮，这才是我们要提倡的工人阶级的作风。
    对毛主席的指示和无产阶级司令部的号令，首先要认真学习。要为革命实践而学。不仅要学得快，而且要力求学得好一些，领会深一些。要随着实际情况的变化，经常学，反复学，不要学一下子就过去了。如果学习不是为了指导革命实践，而是为了别的什么目的，那就不可能正确理解，真正学到，行动上就会脱离毛主席指引的轨道。
    资产阶级思想总是要顽强地表现自己，同毛主席的指示和无产阶级司令部的号令相对抗。要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要进行思想斗争，坚决丢掉一切与之相违背的东西。不敢触及自己的灵魂，光是嘴上说说，是没有什么用的。只有把口头上的紧跟变成实际行动上的紧跟，才是真正的理论联系实际。
    贯彻毛主席的指示，对各级领导来说，一定要闻风而动，雷厉风行，轰轰烈烈，造成声势。但是，紧接着，还要在落实上下功夫。要针对具体情况，扎扎实实地做大量的思想工作和组织工作。这是更加重要更加艰苦的工作。正如毛主席所教导我们的：“把党的方针变为群众的方针，还须要我们长期坚持的、百折不挠的、艰苦卓绝的、耐心而不怕麻烦的努力。没有这样一种努力是一切都不成功的。”
    伟大导师毛主席总是谆谆教导我们理论要结合实际。我们学习毛泽东思想，千万不要忘记毛主席这个最重要最重要的教导。旧教育制度使许多知识分子有一个通病，就是学用脱节，说的多，做的少，对别人马列主义，对自己自由主义。弄不好甚至会滑到阳奉阴违、口是心非、搞两面派的道路上去。我们要认真地帮助知识分子和红卫兵小将树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，掌握林副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作的方针，引导他们在用字上狠下功夫。
    林副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。”理论和实践是结合还是分离，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的根本态度问题。每一个忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战士，都应该发扬理论和实践密切结合的作风，自觉地同言行不一的空谈习气和两面派作风进行坚决的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”
    联系最广大的人民群众，调动一切积极因素，并且尽可能地把消极因素转化为积极因素，这是由工人阶级的阶级本质决定的。因为，“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”山头主义、宗派主义、主观主义、事务主义等等脱离群众的倾向，同无产阶级的党性和群众观点是水火不相容的。
    要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，必须在工人阶级领导下，团结广大群众，这主要是农民群众、城市小资产阶级群众以及有可能改造的知识分子，集中打击一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。
    团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部，这是无产阶级的政策，也是无产阶级文化大革命发展到现阶段必须提起注意的一个问题。
    林副主席说：“全党和全国人民，都要以毛主席为中心来团结，以毛泽东思想为中心来团结。”联系群众，根本的是要用毛泽东思想教育群众，把毛主席的最新指示贯彻到群众中去，把最广大的人民群众团结在毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，为实现毛主席的伟大战略部署而斗争。如果不这样做，那就违背了人民群众的根本利益，因而也就从根本上脱离了群众。
    群众中蕴藏着极大的社会主义积极性。在斗、批、改高潮到来的时候，特别要大兴调查研究之风，大兴抓好典型之风。各级领导要坚持毛主席一贯倡导的从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法。对于群众中的好思想、好办法、好经验，要及时发现，大胆支持，认真总结，热情推广。不抓典型，不大力发扬积极因素，就不能有效地教育群众，引导群众沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署前进。
    在一些红卫兵小将和革命群众发生缺点错误的时候，不要嫌弃他们。要坚持原则，旗帜鲜明地提出批评，又要采取教育群众和保护群众的满腔热情的态度来说话。任何时候都要肯定群众的成绩，爱护群众的革命积极性，相信群众的大多数是要跟毛主席闹革命的，相信知识分子的多数或大多数是能够同工农兵相结合的。我们的责任，是大力做好耐心细致的思想政治工作，去提高他们的觉悟，启发他们认识自己的缺点错误，积极地帮助他们克服和纠正，团结他们共同前进。
    人民内部的不同意见是经常存在的。这是在根本利益一致的基础上的矛盾。真正的无产阶级革命战士，应该一切从人民利益出发，而不是从个人和小集团的私利出发，不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。同意自己观点的，坏人也当成好人，不同意自己观点的，一律加以排斥，这是山头主义的作风，必须坚决反对。
    毛主席教导我们：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，要打倒党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人，同时要改造人们的世界观。自我批评的方法，是革命人民进行自我改造的唯一正确的方法。不断地把自己当作革命的对象，时时进行自我批评，才能步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永作革命的动力。
    一个革命者为人民做一些好事，是本份。如果有什么功勋，应该归于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，归于以毛主席为首的党中央，归于中央军委、中央文革，归于广大人民。要是做错了，就应当进行自我批评，坚决改正。这是忠于伟大领袖毛主席的表现，是对人民负责的表现。改了，坏事就变成好事，错误就变成正确的了。
    林副主席说：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”为什么有的同志在无产阶级文化大革命初期和中期为人民做出了贡献，而后来掉了队甚至犯了错误呢？其中很重要的一个原因，就是不能用一分为二的辩证分析方法认识自己，缺乏自我批评，放松自我革命。这是一个多么深刻的教训啊！
    随着斗、批、改的日益深入，无产阶级“公”字和资产阶级“私”字的斗争，进入了二百米地段，短兵相接。这就要求我们进一步提高自我批评的自觉性。一切决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的革命同志，都要把毛主席的指示和无产阶级司令部的号令作为指导自己行动的最高准则，经常对照检查。符合毛主席伟大战略部署的，就大力发扬。离开了毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是最大的错误，最大的私心，对毛主席最大的不忠，就要进行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评，坚决加以扫除。
    一切剥削阶级都不可能作自我批评。因为他们没有真理，没有群众，一搞自我批评，就要垮台。资产阶级教育制度带给知识分子的恶果之一，就是自以为是，目空一切，文过饰非。有的人沾染了这种坏作风，一时做对了，就自以为一贯正确，躺在功劳簿上不再前进。这些同志应该按照毛主席的教导，“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要。”
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”
    自我批评体现了彻底革命的精神，是工人阶级特有的本色。为了把人类社会推向共产主义的理想境界，工人阶级总是不断提出改造客观世界的雄伟任务，同时在斗争中不断改造自己的主观世界。在伟大的革命斗争中，难道有不作自我批评的无产阶级革命派吗？没有，从来没有。革命的同志们，红卫兵小将们，都应该虚心向工人阶级学习，永远做富于自我批评精神，勇于改正缺点错误的战斗的唯物主义者。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。”
    在我党的历史上，一直存在着两种作风的斗争。一九四二年，毛主席亲自领导的具有伟大历史意义的党的整风运动，战胜了当时存在于党内的种种非无产阶级作风，团结教育了全党和全国人民，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。
    在社会主义时期，无产阶级和资产阶级两种作风的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的重要方面。伟大领袖毛主席早在七届二中全会上就号召全党，要保持和发扬党的优良作风，去战胜资产阶级。建国以来，毛主席总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，在理论上和实践上大大丰富和发展了党的优良作风，保证了我们国家沿着社会主义、共产主义的方向前进。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，长期推行反革命修正主义路线，抵制毛主席亲自培育的党的三大作风，贩卖从孔夫子到蒋介石的一套封建阶级、资产阶级的腐朽作风，妄图腐蚀我们的阶级、我们的党和我们的国家，达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    现在，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线被彻底粉碎了。但是，正如列宁所指出的：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”言行不一、山头主义和文过饰非的坏作风，正是从中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级政治死尸中散发出来的臭气。我们一定要深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把这些坏东西统统扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    毛主席亲手缔造亲自领导、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，几十年来一直是党的三大作风的模范体现者。为了适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，充分发挥无产阶级专政支柱的强大威力，必须进一步加强我军的作风建设。我军每一个老战士，都应该自觉地发扬和传播党的三大作风。每一个新战士，都要努力地学习和继承党的三大作风，使它代代相传，永放光辉。全军指战员要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做理论联系实际的模范，做密切联系群众的模范，做自我批评的模范，同全国人民一道，在毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的坚强领导下，为实现毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进！
