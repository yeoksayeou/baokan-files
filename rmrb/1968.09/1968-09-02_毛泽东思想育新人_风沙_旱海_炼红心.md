Our county of Zhenlai, in the northeastern grasslands of our motherland, is a relatively dry place. Several production brigades have wells with excessive fluoride content. Drinking such water frequently can harm one's health. There are also some brigades where the groundwater level is very low, and the well water cannot meet the water needs of people and livestock.

Facing such difficulties, we are determined to become masters of nature and pioneers in the struggle against nature. We have established a team of female militia members to drill wells, aiming to change the face of our hometown, build a socialist new countryside, and contribute our strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

In the two years since this team was established, we have successfully drilled 51 deep wells and 35 anti-fluoride wells, with a total depth of over 7,000 meters. We have expanded the irrigated area by over 30,000 mu, ensuring that even without rain, good crops can be grown. Now, 21 villages and over 5,700 people in the entire commune have access to the sweet water we have drilled, and the fluoride hazard has been eliminated like an epidemic. These two years have been a period of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought to promote ideological revolutionization; they have also been a period of responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and implementing the great policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people."

We are young women of the Mao Zedong era, determined to forge a path where our predecessors have not tread.

In the winter of 1965, we heard that the higher authorities had approved the establishment of a male militia well-drilling team. This news made our eyes red with excitement. As militia members nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot show weakness in the face of natural disasters. We must achieve new victories in building Dazhai-style new countryside.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Unite and take part in productive work and political activity, improve the economic and political status of women." Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make him proud! We must forge a path where our predecessors have not tread, overcome challenges that others have not faced, and rebel against all the thoughts of the exploiting classes. During those days, our petitions were sent one after another to the brigade and the commune. After repeated requests, the higher authorities finally approved our petition. On February 10, 1966, Zhenlai County saw the historic establishment of the first well-drilling team composed of over 50 female militia members.

The news spread rapidly throughout the commune and the county.

At that time, some people looked at us with surprise and doubt. They said, "We've never heard of girls drilling wells. Just watch, today one will run away from the cold, tomorrow two will run away from exhaustion, and in three days, the team will disband!" The class enemies took the opportunity to emerge. They maliciously said, "Hmph! Relying on these young girls to drill wells and irrigate the fields, the land will be parched three feet deep and cracked into eight pieces!" They spread rumors and slanders everywhere, trying to sabotage the establishment of the well-drilling team.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively supported us and enthusiastically encouraged us. They affectionately said, "These girls are all excellent, just look at their revolutionary spirit, they can do it!"

The support and expectations of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants made us happy; the sarcasm and ridicule of some people made us uncomfortable; the slander and curses of the class enemies made us indignant.

At that time, our newly formed collective was just starting, and there were still some inconsistencies. To be honest, the few squad and platoon leaders were all sweating. Could this team last? Could we drill deep wells? This thought was not only in the leaders but also in the militia members. We immediately realized: if we go into battle with such thoughts, we will retreat at the first sign of difficulty and be defeated.

Facing these active thoughts, we began pre-battle training. We first armed the minds of the female militia members in our well-drilling team with the "Three Articles" (Serve the People, In Memory of Norman Bethune, and The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains), using the "two rulers" and "two mirrors" to examine and compare, using the "three shining examples" as models, and exposing and struggling against our selfishness. After thoroughly studying the "Three Articles" and mobilizing before the battle, our courage to overcome difficulties increased, and our will to undertake arduous tasks became more firm. Squad leader Yin Xiuhong raised her fist and said, "As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we will have wisdom, courage, and enthusiasm. What men can do, we can do; what men have not done, we will do." Everyone unanimously declared, "Yugong can move mountains, Dazhai can create fields, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to bring underground water to the surface."

After studying, we held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in our hands, shouldered red-bannered rifles, carried our bedrolls, sang "The East Is Red," and marched towards Qingshanpu to accept the task of drilling the first well.

Our commune's Hala Benchuo Brigade Qingshanpu Production Team is all sand dunes, even drier than other places. The sand layer is thick, making it the most difficult place to drill wells. It was here that we began our first well-drilling battle since the team's establishment.

Although these female militia members were all excellent workers in the production team, they had never done high-altitude work. Drilling deep wells requires climbing to a six-meter-high iron frame, and every four or five minutes, one must quickly and accurately remove and hang a 20-plus jin heavy wrench. Looking down from the iron frame, the black pit of the well mouth was indeed frightening. How could we overcome this obstacle? Who would be the first to try? Everyone was discussing when the activist Fu Guizhi, who studied Chairman Mao's works, quickly climbed up. When she came down from the well frame, everyone rushed to surround her, asking her how she did it. She said, "I relied on the 'Three Articles' to climb up. With Mao Zedong Thought, even if it were a mountain of knives, I would climb it twice; even if it were a sea of fire, I would wade through it back and forth." After she said this, everyone was eager to try. We recited the quotation, "With firm resolve, fearing not sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory," and climbed up. After several rounds of climbing up and down, the trembling heart had vanished. Overcoming this first obstacle made us realize that as long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we will be selfless and fearless, and no difficulty will be insurmountable.

At that time, we had just started collective life and participated in heavy physical labor. In addition, female comrades have physiological weaknesses, so many aspects of life were not convenient and felt awkward. Take the midnight shift, for example. We are used to going to bed early and waking up early, but in the well-drilling team, it is a three-shift operation. The day shift is fine, but the midnight shift is awkward. When we were sleeping soundly, hearing the shift-change whistle, our eyelids were heavy, and it was hard to wake up. Finally, we forced ourselves to wake up, and our bodies felt heavy. However, the revolutionary cause does not allow us to be the slightest bit slack or the slightest bit ambiguous. We ordered ourselves, "One, two, three, get up!" and jumped up suddenly. In winter, there was no stove in the house, and as soon as we got up, our bodies shivered from the cold, but we still insisted on fighting.

We drill wells, not using electricity or machinery, but relying on our bodies and hands. The most basic operation is pushing the rotating rod in circles. At the beginning, most comrades could not endure this task of circling the well mouth to push the rotating rod. However, because we read Chairman Mao's books, our hearts were red, our eyes were bright, and our direction was clear. We, dozens of female militia members, had one heart: to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" with our actual actions. We clearly knew that in the struggle against nature, there are two lines of struggle. One is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the other is the bourgeois reactionary line. The bourgeois reactionary line often relies on "foreign experts," machinery, and asking the state for money. We firmly oppose the bourgeois reactionary line and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the thorough revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance. Many comrades said: We drill wells to take water, but it is not just for taking water. More importantly, in the struggle against nature, we actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, cultivating ourselves into good militia members who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is by actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and continuously promoting ideological revolutionization that we have changed our living habits, overcome physiological weaknesses, and marched forward without stopping.

After eight days and nights of arduous struggle, we successfully drilled an 80-meter-deep first well, creating a new record for deep well drilling in our commune and achieving our first victory in the struggle against nature.

Standing by the well frame, looking at the fruits of our battle, and reviewing the course of our battle, our hearts bloomed with joy. We excitedly stood by the well frame, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait, singing "The East Is Red" over and over, and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" over and over. Through our practice, we have thoroughly smashed the idea of not believing in the masses and superstition in so-called "experts" and "authorities," and we have smashed the sabotage plots of the class enemies. The facts tell us: as long as we are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and rely closely on the masses, we can have great wisdom and courage, and we can subdue dragons and tigers. No matter how urgent, difficult, arduous, or dangerous the battle tasks are, we can attack without fail and be invincible in battle.

"People's joy is the day of misery for counter-revolutionaries." The class enemies who once boasted and hoped for our failure in well drilling have been silenced in the face of our victory. Those with conservative thoughts have also changed from doubt to belief. The broad masses of commune members came in groups to the well frame, surrounding us. An old woman named Wang, who had been ill for many years and rarely left her home, was supported by her grandson to the well mouth. She looked and looked, grabbed our hands, patted our shoulders, and said excitedly, "You are truly Chairman Mao's good girls! You are the good girls of the poor and lower-middle peasants! We never even dared to think of doing what you have done. You are truly iron girls!"

The old women and men praised us with the name "Iron Girls." Thus, the name "Iron Girls" well-drilling team spread. However, we know that we are still far from meeting the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We are determined not to disappoint the poor and lower-middle peasants and to cultivate ourselves into good militia members who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

Since then, our team has continued to grow and develop from the original over 50 female militia members to over 100, from one militia squad to the current "Iron Girls" militia company.

In the arduous struggle, we have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, forging red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao.

"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, we have tempered our will in ordinary labor and forged our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao in harsh environments. Especially after the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle, we have thoroughly criticized the "philosophy of survival" and the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "public and private fusion" of China's Khrushchev. The selfless communist ideology and fearless revolutionary heroism have been greatly promoted. Many team members have remained calm and fearless in life-threatening situations.

Drilling for gravel is not only the most tense and arduous battle but also the most dangerous moment. This spring, when our second squad was drilling in Xietelai, a reverse drill threw Comrade Yu Guilan more than a meter away, and she fainted immediately. However, as soon as she regained consciousness, she urged her comrades, "You all go to work, don't worry about me, don't let me affect production." Saying this, she propped herself up and wanted to participate in the battle. Her comrades persuaded her with great difficulty. The next day, when it was time for the shift change, she insisted on returning to the construction site and could not be persuaded to go back. She said, "Ma Xian obtained such heavy injuries and still insisted on fighting for more than three hours. Soldiers in the army do not complain when heavily injured and do not leave the battlefield when lightly injured. How can I lie down with just this little injury?"

All the comrades in our company have a common oath: "Rather die for the proletariat's 'public' than live for the bourgeoisie's 'private,' revolution fears no death, fearing death is no revolution." Squad leader Jiang Bao Hua once had her finger crushed by a wrench while operating on the workbench. She clenched her teeth and did not make a sound. The blood from her finger dripped onto her comrades below, who only then knew she was injured and urged her to go down immediately. She insisted on continuing until the drill was completed before going to apply medicine. Last July, team member Gu Guizhen had half of her right index finger cut off while pulling a pin at the well mouth. This was the most serious accident in our company in the past two years. At that time, she was in so much pain that her face turned pale. Her comrades rushed over, applying medicine and bandaging her while comforting her. She said, "Norman Bethune was a foreigner who sacrificed his life for the Chinese revolution. I am a militia member, losing half a finger for socialist construction is nothing! The accident can only injure my body, but it cannot shake my firm will to drill wells for the revolution."

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to counter the slanders of China's Khrushchev and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists against the workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, we turned the construction site into a battlefield and launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle. The more we criticized the fallacies of the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the redder our hearts became, the brighter our eyes became, and the more enthusiastic we became. Comrades said: A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists oppose us workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, which proves that we have achieved results. Great Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever tries to obstruct us from mastering Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely fight them to the end!

Our company's characteristic is its high mobility and outdoor operations, which are somewhat like a "mobile army." In addition to frequent difficulties with food and shelter, take the example of pushing the rotating rod while walking: we roughly calculated that in normal circumstances, for every well drilled, just the distance of lowering and raising the drill is over 300 li. In the past two years and five months, we have walked over 30,000 li in total, equivalent to traveling from our Zhenlai County to Beijing six times. This is our "Long March" around the well mouth! We feel that on this "Long March," the more wells we drill and the longer we walk, the closer we get to Chairman Mao, and our hearts are closer to Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "All our achievements and victories are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought." Vice Chairman Lin's words truly resonate with our hearts. Reviewing the more than two years of battle journey, every victory we have achieved is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership; every step forward is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛泽东思想育新人　风沙“旱海”炼红心
    吉林省镇赉县黑鱼泡公社“铁姑娘”打井队民兵连
    我们镇赉县黑鱼泡公社，在祖国东北部大草原上，是个比较干旱的地方。有几个大队，井水里含氟量过大，常吃这种水，就会损害人的健康。还有一些大队，地下水位很低，井水满足不了人、畜吃水的需要。
    面对这样的困难，我们立志要做大自然的主人，要做战天斗地的闯将。我们成立了一支由女基干民兵组成的打井队，为改变家乡面貌，建设社会主义新农村，为中国革命和世界革命贡献出自己的力量。
    这支队伍建立两年多来，一共打成了深机井五十一眼，防氟井三十五眼，总深度七千多米，扩大了灌溉面积三万多亩，使这些土地，就是经常不落雨，也可以长出好庄稼。现在，全公社已经有二十一个村屯，五千七百多人口，吃到了我们打出来的甜水，氟害象瘟神一样被赶走了。这两年，是我们活学活用毛泽东思想，促进思想革命化的两年；也是我们响应毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，贯彻执行“备战、备荒、为人民”伟大方针的两年。
    我们是毛泽东时代的女青年，就是要走前辈妇女没有走过的路
    一九六五年冬天，听说上级批准男基干民兵成立打井队，真把我们眼睛都急红了。我们是毛泽东思想哺育下的民兵，决不能在战胜自然灾害面前示弱。我们要为建设大寨式的新农村立新功。
    毛主席教导我们说：“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位。”毛主席他老人家为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气！我们就是要走前辈妇女没有走过的路，就是要闯前人没有闯过的关，就是要造一切剥削阶级思想的反。在那些天里，我们的请战书一份接着一份送到大队，送到公社。经过再三请求，上级终于批准了。一九六六年的二月十日，镇赉县出现了历史上第一支由五十多名女基干民兵组成的打井队。
    消息飞快地在全公社、全县传开了。
    当时，有人用惊奇、怀疑的眼光看着我们。他们说：“从来没听说过小姑娘能打井。瞧着吧，今天冻跑一个，明天累跑两个，三天不到黑，就得散伙！”
    阶级敌人乘机钻了出来。他们恶狠狠地说：“哼！指望这帮黄毛丫头打井浇地，地还不得旱它三尺，裂成八瓣！”他们到处散布流言蜚语，破坏打井队的建立。
    广大贫下中农，积极地支持我们，热情地鼓励我们。他们亲切地说：“这帮姑娘个顶个是好样的，就凭这股子革命劲头，能行！”
    广大贫下中农的支持和期望，使我们高兴；一些人的讽刺和挖苦，使我们难受；阶级敌人的诬蔑和咒骂，使我们愤恨。
    当时，我们这个新生的集体刚起炉灶，还有点文齐武不齐的。说实在的，我们几个班、排干部都捏着一把汗。我们这个队伍能长久吗，打深机井能行吗？这种思想不仅干部有，在基干民兵中也有。我们立刻警觉到：如果带着这种思想上阵，还不是见硬就卷，败下阵来。
    针对这些活思想，我们开始了战前整训。我们首先用“老三篇”武装我们打井队女民兵排的头脑，用“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”检查、对照，用“三个光辉形象”作榜样，亮私、斗私。经过大学“老三篇”，战前大动员，我们战胜困难的勇气更足了，担负艰险任务的意志更坚定了。排长殷秀荣挥动着拳头说：“只要我们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，我们就有智慧、有胆量、有干劲。男同志能干的，我们就能干；男同志没有干的，我们也要干。”大家一致表示：“愚公能搬山，大寨能造田，我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就一定能把地下水引出地面。”
    经过学习，我们手拿着《毛主席语录》，肩扛着红缨枪，背着行李卷，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，迈着大步，走向青山堡，接受打第一眼井的任务。
    我们公社哈拉本召大队青山堡生产队，一色是沙包地，比别的地方旱得更厉害。流沙层厚，历来是打井最困难的地方。我们就是在这个地方，开始了建队以来的第一次打井的战斗。
    我们这些女民兵，虽然在生产队参加劳动个个是把好手，可是登高上房这类事可没干过。打深机井，要上到六米多高的铁架子上，每隔四、五分钟，要以稳、准、快的动作，把二十多斤重的管钳子摘挂一次。在铁架子上往下一看，黑洞洞的井口，真有点吓人。这个关怎么闯呢？谁先闯呢？大伙正在议论的时候，学习毛主席著作积极分子傅桂芝，嗖嗖几步就蹿上去了。当她从井架上下来的时候，大伙一哄地就把她围了起来，争着问她怎么上去的。她说：“靠‘老三篇’上去的。有了毛泽东思想，别说铁架子，就是刀山，也闯它两遍；火海，也趟它个来回。”她这么一说，大家一个个磨拳擦掌地都要较量较量。我们一边念着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录，一边就往上爬。上上下下几个来回，那种颤颤突突的心理，早跑没影了。闯过这第一道关，更加使我们体会到，只要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，就无私、无畏，什么困难都不在话下。
    当时我们刚开始过集体生活，又参加很重的体力劳动，再加上女同志生理上的弱点，所以生活上好多地方不习惯，可别扭了。就拿半夜零点上班来说吧，我们习惯早睡、早起，而来到打井队是三班作业，白班还好说，半夜零点上班就别扭了。睡得正熟，听到接班笛子响，眼皮就是睁不开，好歹醒过来，身子沉甸甸的。但是，革命事业不容许我们有稍微的松懈，更不容许我们有半点的含糊。我们就命令自己：“一、二、三，起！”猛地一下子窜起来。冬季屋里没有炉子，一起身，浑身冷得打颤颤，大家仍然坚持战斗。
    我们打井，一不是用电力，二不是用机器，就是靠一个身子两只手。最基本的操作，就是推着转杆转圈圈。开始，围着井口推转杆这个活，多数同志吃不消。可是，由于我们读了毛主席的书，心红眼亮方向明。我们几十个女基干民兵一个心眼：要以自己的实际行动贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”，“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针。我们清楚知道，向大自然开战，也有两条路线的斗争。一条是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一条是资产阶级反动路线。资产阶级反动路线，动不动就要靠“洋专家”，靠大机器，靠伸手向国家要钱。我们坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠发扬艰苦奋斗，自力更生的彻底革命精神。许多同志说：我们打井是为了取水，但是又不仅仅为了取水，更重要的，是在战天斗地中，活学活用毛泽东思想，把我们培养成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好民兵。就是靠着活学活用毛泽东思想，不断促进思想革命化，使我们在斗争中改变了生活习惯，克服了生理上的弱点，勇往直前，没有停顿过一步。
    经过八天八夜的艰苦奋战，我们打成了八十多米深的第一眼机井，创造了我们公社打深机井的新纪录，取得了战天斗地的第一个胜利。
    我们面对战斗的成果，回顾着战斗的历程，心里乐开了花。我们激动地站在井架旁，仰望着毛主席像，一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”通过我们的实践，大破了不相信群众，迷信所谓“专家”、“权威”的思想，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。事实告诉我们：只要无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，紧紧依靠群众，就能有大智大勇，就能降龙伏虎。不管什么急、难、艰、险的战斗任务，都能攻无不克，战无不胜。
      “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”曾经嚣张一时盼望着我们打井失败的阶级敌人，在我们的胜利面前，灰溜溜地再也不敢吭声了。思想守旧的人，也由怀疑变成了信服。广大社员成群结队地来到井架旁，把我们团团围住。一个患病多年，家门不出的王大娘，让她孙子扶着来到井口旁边，她看了又看，一把攥住我们的手，拍着我们的肩膀，激动地说：“你们真是毛主席的好姑娘！贫下中农的好姑娘啊！我们早先连想都不敢想的事，你们就干出来了。你们简直是铁姑娘！”
    老大娘、老大爷用“铁姑娘”这个名字夸奖我们。于是，“铁姑娘”打井队这个名字就传开了。不过，我们自己知道，我们离贫下中农的要求还差得很远、很远。我们决心不辜负贫下中农的希望，把自己培养成为一辈子忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线的好民兵。
    从这以后，我们这支队伍不断发展壮大，从原来五十多名女基干民兵发展到一百多名，由一个民兵排，发展成现在的“铁姑娘”民兵连了。
      在艰苦的斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，炼红了忠于毛主席的心
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我们在平凡的劳动中磨炼了意志；在艰苦的环境中锤炼了无限忠于毛主席的红心。特别是经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和革命大批判的深入开展，我们狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”和“剥削有功”、“公私溶化”论等等谬论，一心为公的共产主义思想和大无畏的革命英雄主义得到大大发扬。许多队员在遇到生命攸关的紧要关头，作到了面不改色，心不跳。
    打鹅卵石不仅是最紧张、最艰巨的战斗，也是最容易出危险的时刻。今年春天，我们二排在谢特来屯打井时打了倒转，把于桂兰同志扔出一米多远，当时她就昏迷过去了。可是，当她刚刚苏醒过来的时候，她立即催促着同志们说：“你们快去干活吧，不要管我，别因为我影响了生产。”说着说着，她支起身子还要去参加战斗。同志们好说歹说才把她劝住。当第二天接班时，她到底又来到了工地，再也劝不回去了。她说：“麦贤得负那么重的伤，还坚持战斗三个多小时，解放军打敌人时重伤不叫苦，轻伤不下火线，我这点伤怎么能躺得住呢？”
    我们全连同志有个共同的誓言：“宁为无产阶级‘公’字死，不为资产阶级‘私’字生，革命不怕死，怕死不革命。”一排排长姜柏华同志，一次正在工作台上操作，管钳子把手指头夹破了，她咬着牙，一声没吭。手指的血一滴一滴地往下淌，落到同志们的身上，下边的同志才知道她负了伤，就催她赶快下来，她却一直坚持到起完了钻才去上药。去年七月，队员谷桂珍在井口拔插销时，右手食指掐掉了半截。这是我们连两年来发生的最严重的一次事故。当时，她疼的脸色都白了，同志们急忙跑过去，一边为她上药、包扎，一边安慰她。她却说：“白求恩是个外国人，为中国革命牺牲了他的生命。我是个基干民兵，为社会主义建设掉半个手指头有啥了不起的！事故只能损伤我的肉体，但是半点也动摇不了我为革命打井的坚强意志。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了反击中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的诬蔑，我们把工地作战场，掀起革命大批判的高潮。我们越批判反革命修正主义分子的谬论，心越红，眼越亮，干劲越足。同志们说：一小撮反革命修正主义分子反对我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，更加证明我们学出了成绩。伟大的毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。谁想阻挠我们掌握毛泽东思想，我们就坚决和他们斗争到底！
    我们连的特点是流动性大，野外作业，多少带点“野战军”的性质。除了吃的、住的经常发生许多困难外，就拿推转杆走路来说吧：我们大略计算了一下，在正常的情况下，每打一眼井，仅下钻和起钻的路程，就有三百多华里。这两年零五个月，我们共计走了三万多华里，等于从我们镇赉县到北京，走了六个来回。这是我们围着井口所进行的万里长征啊！我们觉得在这“长征”的路上，我们打的井越多，走的路越长，离毛主席就越近，我们的心和毛主席就贴得越紧。
    林副主席指出：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”林副主席的话，真是句句说到了我们的心坎上。回顾两年多的战斗历程，我们取得的每一次胜利，都是毛主席英明领导的结果；每前进一步，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
