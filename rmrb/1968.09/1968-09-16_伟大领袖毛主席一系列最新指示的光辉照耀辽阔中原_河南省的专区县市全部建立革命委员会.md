In the glorious light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all the prefectures, counties, and cities of Henan Province. The mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing across the province. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held throughout the region, and the tide of revolutionary criticism is surging forward. Industrial and agricultural production is improving, and the broad revolutionary masses are determined to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, ZHENGZHOU, September 15 — Under the glorious light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, all ten prefectures and 126 counties and cities in Henan Province have established revolutionary committees. Ninety-eight percent of the rural people's communes in the province have also established revolutionary committees. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Henan last September, greatly encouraging the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the province. The workers of the province, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two diametrically opposed factions," first achieved great unity among the revolutionary masses. They immediately led the broad revolutionary masses in a heroic struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Henan, Wen Minsheng and Zhao Wenfu, and won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in January, establishing the provincial revolutionary committee.

After the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it has firmly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, relying on the working class and its most reliable ally, the poor and lower-middle peasants, as well as the broad revolutionary Red Guards, to launch a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Henan Province. It has combined the great criticism with the cleansing of the class ranks, striking a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and greatly consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all levels of revolutionary committees in the province have led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce criticism of the reactionary bourgeois "theory of multiple centers." Under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary people of the province have unified their thinking, unified their steps, and unified their actions, achieving revolutionary great unity across the board in terms of systems, industries, and classes.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in Henan Province is excellent. The mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing, and various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held throughout the province. The tide of revolutionary criticism is surging forward, Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is deeply rooted in people's hearts. The working class and the broad revolutionary masses have shown great revolutionary enthusiasm in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, powerfully promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. The output of metallurgy, coal, textiles, machinery, and other industrial products has increased significantly, and new products are constantly emerging. Agricultural production, based on last year's bumper harvest, has seen the broad poor and lower-middle peasants overcome drought and achieve another bumper harvest of summer crops. Currently, autumn crops are growing well, and there is a prosperous harvest scene everywhere.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all other work." "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses." The revolutionary committees at all levels in Henan Province, following the teachings of great leader Chairman Mao, have organized one team after another of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter all colleges and universities, some middle schools, and some units that have not yet done a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the province. Under the leadership of the working class, a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation has swept across the province, and inspiring revolutionary scenes are everywhere. At present, the broad revolutionary masses of the province are determined to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and strive forward to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀辽阔中原
    河南省的专区县市全部建立革命委员会
    全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃发展，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍及各地，革命大批判的洪流滚滚向前，工农业生产越来越好，广大革命群众决心更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，打好斗、批、改这一仗
    新华社郑州十五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，河南全省十个专区和一百二十六个县、市全部建立了革命委员会。全省百分之九十八的农村人民公社也都建立了革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在去年九月亲临河南视察，极大地鼓舞了全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众。全省工人阶级遵照毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，首先实现了革命大联合，并且立即带领广大革命群众，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南的代理人文敏生、赵文甫等进行了英勇的斗争，在今年元月夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，建立了省革命委员会。
    河南省革命委员会成立以后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地依靠工人阶级和工人阶级最可靠的同盟军贫下中农以及广大革命的红卫兵小将，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南省的代理人展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，并且把大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密地结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，加强了无产阶级专政，极大地巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，全省各级革命委员会带领广大革命群众狠批了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，全省革命人民统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，全面地实现了按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合。
    目前，河南全省革命、生产形势一片大好。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃开展，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍及全省各地，革命大批判的洪流滚滚向前，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。工人阶级和广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，有力地推动着工农业生产的发展。冶金、煤炭、纺织、机械等工业产品的产量大幅度增长，新产品不断涌现。农业生产在去年获得丰收的基础上，广大贫下中农战胜干旱，又获得夏季作物的丰收。目前，秋季作物长势很好，到处一片丰收景象。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”。河南省各级革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，组织了一支又一支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进了全省所有的大专院校、一部分中小学和一些还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。在工人阶级的领导下，全省范围内掀起了一个斗、批、改的新高潮，处处出现令人鼓舞的革命景象。目前，全省广大革命群众决心更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，打好斗、批、改这一仗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进。
