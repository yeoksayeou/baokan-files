    Your Suggestion Helped Me

    Recently, a worker from the Chongqing Wireless Electronics Factory No. 2 gave a suggestion to the Revolutionary Committee Chairman Liu Jingquan. The worker criticized Liu for not consulting with the masses or discussing with the Revolutionary Committee members before deciding to send a comrade to attend the "Celebration of the Birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee" meeting. The worker also severely criticized him for this decision.

    Liu Jingquan heard this and thought: "The decision to send that comrade to attend the celebration was clearly made after collective research and approval by the Revolutionary Committee, and it was not a decision I made privately. Why was I criticized without any investigation?" He felt a bit wronged in his heart. However, he then thought about Chairman Mao's teachings: "Those who speak have no guilt, those who listen should be cautious," and "If there is a fault, correct it; if there is none, strive to improve." He also thought about Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." His heart became clear. He thought: "Although this worker's suggestion is incorrect, he made it with full enthusiasm and out of concern for the Revolutionary Committee. Moreover, it can serve as a lesson to prevent similar issues in the future. If I were to reject this suggestion, wouldn't that be like the past faction within the Party that suppressed differing opinions?" With this thought, he no longer felt wronged.

    Later, the worker learned that the decision to send the comrade to attend the "Celebration of the Birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee" was not made privately by Chairman Liu Jingquan. The worker then came to apologize to him. Liu Jingquan said to the worker: "Your suggestion helped me and served as a warning. I should pay attention to this aspect." The worker, moved, said: "The Revolutionary Committee Chairman can humbly accept even incorrect criticisms. What else do we have to fear speaking out about?" The veteran workers present also proudly said, "With such leaders who believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses, we are a thousand times and ten thousand times at ease."

    “你提的意见  对我有帮助”
    前些日子，重庆市无线电二厂一个工人给革命委员会主任刘景泉提了一条意见，说他不同群众商量，也不同革委会成员研究，就私自决定叫一个同志去参加“庆祝四川省革命委员会诞生”大会，并严厉地批评了他。
    刘景泉听了，心想：决定那个同志去参加观礼，明明是经过革命委员会集体研究通过的，根本不是我私自决定的，为什么没有调查就批评人？他心里感到有些冤枉。可是，他又想到毛主席的“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”的教导和毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”心里就豁然亮堂了。他想：这位工人提的这条意见虽然不对，但他是怀着满腔热情从爱护革委会出发的，更何况它可以作为以后防止发生类似问题的借鉴呢。若是把这条意见给顶回去，这岂不是象过去党内一小撮走资派压制不同意见一样了吗？这样一想，他再也不觉得冤枉了。
    后来，这个工人了解到参加“庆祝四川省革命委员会诞生”观礼的这个同志不是革委会主任刘景泉同志私自决定的，就来向他作检讨。刘景泉同志对他说：“你提的意见对我有帮助，给我敲了警钟，我在这方面是应该注意的。”这个工人听了，激动地说：“革命委员会主任连不正确的批评都能虚心听取，我们还有什么心里话不敢讲呢！”
    在场的老工人听了，也自豪地说，有这样相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众的领导为我们掌权，我们一千个放心，一万个放心。
