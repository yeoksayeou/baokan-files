Tokyo, Sept. 21 (New China News Agency) - Japanese revolutionary friends pointed out that the important inscription by Chairman Mao to Japanese workers points out the direction for the victory and advancement of the Japanese people's revolution, providing immense inspiration to the Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class.

A spokesman for the National Coordinating Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing) said in a statement to Chinese reporters on Sept. 19 that Comrade Mao Zedong's inscription to Japanese workers has indicated the direction for the victory and advancement of the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism, against the Japanese comprador bourgeoisie, against Soviet modern revisionism, and against the revisionist group led by Komoto. It provides immense inspiration to the Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class.

The spokesman said that since the Komoto revisionist group shamefully betrayed the revolution, Japanese Marxist-Leninists who are loyal to the revolution have resolutely drawn a clear line of demarcation from the Komoto revisionist group in ideology, politics, and organization, and have fought against it. They have also fought to establish Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology within their ranks. Currently, various organizations of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing) are enthusiastically carrying out the movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The spokesman said that without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary practice. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are universal truths applicable everywhere. We must not only continuously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought but also master and apply them.

The spokesman said that Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application. 'There are two attitudes towards learning. One is the dogmatic attitude, which, regardless of China's situation, indiscriminately adopts everything, both applicable and inapplicable. This attitude is not good. The other attitude is to think with one's brain while learning, to learn those things that suit China's situation, that is, to absorb beneficial experiences. This is the attitude we need.'"

The spokesman said that combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution is a task we must accomplish. Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary practice. Without revolutionary practice, theory has no meaning. We must adhere to the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and from the specific situation and actual life of Japan, formulate policies and strategies.

The spokesman said that if one does not adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, one will betray the revolution and degenerate into modern revisionism, just like the Khrushchev revisionist group in China and the Komoto revisionist group. This has many negative lessons in the history of the Japanese revolution, and the Komoto revisionist group is a typical example. Although the Komoto revisionist group also talks about Marxism-Leninism, it has long since surrendered to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and become the most shameful traitors against communism, revolution, and the people.

The spokesman said that the revolutionary situation in Japan is excellent. The ranks of the people of all revolutionary classes and strata, with the working class as the vanguard, fighting against U.S. imperialism, the comprador bourgeoisie and reactionaries, and against Soviet modern revisionism and the Komoto revisionist group, are growing. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are spreading among the broad masses of the Japanese people. The ugly faces of Soviet modern revisionism and the Komoto revisionist group in opposing communism, the people, and revolution are further exposed. At this moment, the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's important inscription to Japanese workers is of great significance. All revolutionary leftists must study and deeply understand this inscription, strive to combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, and promote the development of the Japanese revolution. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

Shadow Mountain Haruo, a standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing), said that the important inscription by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of the world, to Japanese workers greatly inspires and encourages the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese working class and people, and clearly points out the road to victory for them. Chairman Mao's inscription not only has great and far-reaching significance for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people but also for the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. The current era is an era with Mao Zedong Thought as its banner. The storm of struggle by the seven hundred million Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world is advancing. As part of this struggle, the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is also advancing. In this situation, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, who are in deep crisis, in close collaboration with the international revisionist led by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, including the Komoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, are desperately plotting to sabotage the people's revolutionary struggle. Under these circumstances, the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's important inscription is of particular importance.

Shadow Mountain Haruo said that the Komoto revisionist group, under the banner of so-called "independence and self-reliance," has completely betrayed the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, fallen into the mire of bourgeois nationalism, followed Soviet modern revisionism, thrown the ideas of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship to the winds, and eagerly pursued the so-called "peaceful revolution through parliament." They have degenerated into a bunch of counter-revolutionaries, anti-people, anti-China traitors, and become a special action force for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Now, the Komoto revisionist group has exposed its true face before the broad masses of the people and suffered a serious setback.

Shadow Mountain Haruo said that the Chinese people are on the verge of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while the Soviet social-imperialist invasion of Czechoslovakia marks the disintegration and total collapse of the international revisionist clique. These facts clearly indicate to the people of the world: the only road and the great direction that the revolutionary people of the world should take is the road indicated by Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. There is no other road.

Shadow Mountain Haruo said that Japanese Marxist-Leninists who are loyal to the revolution quickly saw through the treacherous behavior of modern revisionism and bravely stood up to establish left-wing party organizations guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought in various parts of Japan.

He said: Chairman Mao pointed out: "The theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are 'universal truths.' 'How are the theories of Marxism-Leninism and the actual practice of the Chinese revolution related? To put it in a popular way, it is 'having a target to shoot at.' Some comrades are just shooting blindly, firing indiscriminately, and such people are likely to mess up the revolution.' We must combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution and accomplish the great task of the Japanese revolution.

He said that in the new upsurge of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, we must study the invincible Mao Zedong Thought more deeply, seriously regard Comrade Mao Zedong's inscription as a guiding principle for the struggle, and be good at applying Mao Zedong Thought concretely to the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. This is of particular importance.

He said that we are determined to strive to build a powerful party armed with Mao Zedong Thought, to mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate in the revolution, and to bravely complete the glorious tasks of the Japanese revolution and the world revolution without fear of hardships and difficulties.

A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Youth League said: Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers inspires young Japanese people who truly want revolution.

He said that Marxism-Leninism is the most revolutionary and scientific thought of the proletariat of the world; all young Japanese people who are willing to serve the proletariat and the people must truly master this truth. Chairman Mao's teaching on "combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution" is the most important issue facing the Japanese people and youth.

He said that now, the just struggle of the Japanese revolutionary people is flourishing. In this struggle, young people must seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

He finally expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's teaching in this inscription and strive with all his might for the revolution of Japan.

    日本革命朋友热烈欢呼毛主席题词给日本人民无比巨大的鼓舞
    把马列主义、毛泽东思想同革命实践相结合  下定决心胜利完成日本革命的伟大光荣任务
    马列主义、毛泽东思想正在日本人民中普及，日本革命形势大好；宫本集团彻底背叛马列主义，已堕落成为可耻叛徒
    新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：日本革命朋友指出，伟大领袖毛主席给日本工人朋友们的重要题词，指出了日本人民革命胜利前进的方向，给日本人民，尤其是日本工人阶级以无比巨大的鼓舞。
    日本共产党（左派）全国协议会发言人十九日向中国记者发表谈话说，毛泽东同志书赠日本工人朋友们的题词，给了日本人民反对美帝国主义，反对日本卖国垄断资产阶级，反对苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团的革命斗争，指出了胜利前进的方向，给日本人民，尤其是日本工人阶级以无比巨大的鼓舞。
    发言人说，从宫本修正主义集团可耻地叛变革命以来，忠于革命的日本马克思列宁主义者，坚决同宫本修正主义集团从思想上、政治上、组织上划清界线，同它进行斗争，并且为在自己的队伍中，树立马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为指导思想而斗争。目前，日本共产党左派的各个组织正在以巨大的热情开展学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的运动。
    发言人说，没有革命的理论，就没有革命的实践。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。我们不仅要不断地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，而且还要能够精通它，应用它。
    发言人说，毛泽东同志教导我们说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”“学习有两种态度。一种是教条主义的态度，不管我国情况，适用的和不适用的，一起搬来。这种态度不好。另一种态度，学习的时候用脑筋想一下，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西，即吸取对我们有益的经验，我们需要的是这样一种态度。”
    发言人说，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，这是我们必须完成的任务。没有革命的理论，就没有革命的实践。没有革命的实践，理论就没有什么意义了。我们一定要坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，并且从日本的具体情况和实际生活出发，制定政策和策略。
    发言人说，如果不坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，那么就会象中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团以及宫本修正主义集团那样，背叛革命，堕落成为现代修正主义。这一点，在日本革命斗争的历史上，有过许多反面教训，而宫本修正主义集团就是最典型的一个例子。宫本修正主义集团虽然在口头上也讲马克思列宁主义，但是，早就屈服于美日反动派，充当了反共、反革命、反人民的最可耻的叛徒。
    发言人说，日本革命形势大好。以工人阶级为先锋的各革命阶级和阶层的人民反对美帝国主义，反对卖国垄断资产阶级和反动派，反对苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团的斗争的队伍正在日益发展。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想正在普及到日本广大人民之中，苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团的反共、反人民、反革命的丑恶嘴脸进一步赤裸裸地暴露出来。正在这个时候，毛泽东同志给日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表，具有极其重大的意义。一切革命左派，一定要好好学习和深刻领会这一题词，努力把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，与日本革命的具体实践相结合，使日本革命向前发展。这是日本革命取得胜利的最可靠的保证。
    日共山口县委员会（左派）常务委员影山春雄说，全世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志给日本工人朋友们的重要题词，极大地鼓舞和激励了日本工人阶级和日本人民的革命斗争，并且给日本工人阶级和日本人民明确地指出了取得胜利的道路。毛主席的题词，不仅对日本人民的革命斗争，而且对全世界人民的革命斗争，都具有极为重大和深远的意义。当前的时代，是以毛泽东思想为旗帜的新时代。七亿中国人民以及全世界革命人民的斗争风暴正在向前发展。作为这个斗争的一个组成部分的日本人民的反美爱国斗争，也正在向前发展。在这种形势下，陷入了深刻危机的美日反动派，同以苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的、包括日共宫本修正主义集团在内的国际修正主义密切配合，拚命地进行策划，企图破坏人民革命斗争。在这种情况下，毛泽东同志的重要题词的发表，具有特别重要的意义。
    影山春雄说，宫本修正主义集团打出所谓“独立自主”的招牌，彻头彻尾地背叛了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，掉进资产阶级民族主义的泥坑里，追随苏联现代修正主义，把无产阶级革命、无产阶级专政的思想抛到九霄云外，热心追求所谓“通过议会进行和平革命”的道路。它们已经堕落成为反革命、反人民、反华的一伙叛徒，成为美日反动派的别动队。现在，宫本修正主义集团在广大人民面前，暴露了它的真面目，并且遭到了严重的破产。
    影山春雄说，中国人民正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，而苏联社会帝国主义侵略捷克斯洛伐克标志着国际修正主义集团的分崩离析和总破产。这些事实，向全世界人民明确地指出：全世界革命人民应走的道路和它们的大方向，只能是毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命所指引的道路，除此之外，别无其它道路。
    影山春雄说，忠于革命的日本马克思列宁主义者，很快地识破了现代修正主义的背叛行为，并勇敢地站起来，在日本各地建立以伟大的毛泽东思想为指导思想的左派党组织。
    他说：毛主席指出：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，是‘放之四海而皆准’的理论。”“马克思列宁主义理论和中国革命实际，怎样互相联系呢？拿一句通俗的话来讲，就是‘有的放矢’。”“马克思列宁主义和中国革命的关系，就是箭和靶的关系。有些同志却在那里‘无的放矢’，乱放一通，这样的人就容易把革命弄坏。”我们必须把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践结合起来，胜利地完成日本革命的伟大任务。
    他说，在反帝反修斗争的新高潮中，我们必须更加深入地学习战无不胜的毛泽东思想，认真地把毛泽东同志的题词作为斗争的指针，善于把毛泽东思想具体地运用到日本人民的革命斗争中去，这具有特别重要的意义。
    他说，我们下定决心，一定要争取建立用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的党，把广大人民群众发动起来参加革命，不怕艰难困苦地勇敢地去完成日本革命和世界革命的光荣任务。
    日本共产主义青年同盟东京都委员会发言人说：毛主席书赠日本工人朋友们的题词，鼓舞着真正愿意革命的日本青年。
    他说，马克思列宁主义是全世界无产阶级最革命的、最科学的思想；一切愿为无产阶级和人民服务的日本青年，必须把这一真理真正学到手。毛主席关于“马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合”的教导，是我们日本人民和青年面临的最重要的问题。
    他说，现在，日本革命人民的正义斗争正在蓬勃地发展。在这场斗争中，青年们必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    他最后表示一定要遵照毛主席这个题词的教导，竭尽全力，为日本革命而斗争到底。
