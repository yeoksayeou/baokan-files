The Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory is earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and comprehensively arranging the re-education of intellectuals.

All technical personnel in the factory have been sent to production teams in batches to work as laborers. Those who have not yet been sent down are also participating in labor in various teams, working alongside workers on design and technological innovations. At the same time, a number of workers with practical experience have been selected to strengthen the technical team.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hohhot on the 19th, the great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Students trained in old-style schools, the majority or a large majority, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and innovations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." The Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory in Hohhot and the broad revolutionary workers, in the midst of deepening the struggle, criticism, and transformation, have timely grasped the issue of reforming the entire factory's technical team. They have sent all technical personnel, who graduated from colleges and universities, to production teams in batches to work as laborers. Those who have not yet been sent down are also participating in labor in various teams, working alongside workers on design and technological innovations, thus combining intellectuals with the masses of workers. At the same time, the factory has selected a number of workers with practical experience to strengthen the technical team. After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals were issued, the factory's Revolutionary Committee and all revolutionary workers were overjoyed and took immediate action. They have made comprehensive arrangements for the re-education of all intellectuals in the factory, including those in the party and government cadres.

The Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory is a factory with over a thousand employees that produces diesel engines. Before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders in the factory vigorously promoted the reactionary revisionist line of "experts managing the factory" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. They allowed a few reactionary technical "authorities" with serious political and historical problems to hold the reins of technical leadership in the entire factory, pushing out technical staff of worker origin. Most of the college and university graduates assigned to the factory over the years were directly placed in offices and the factory headquarters to engage in design and technical management work. These students, educated by bourgeois intellectuals, were poisoned by the reactionary revisionist line of "experts managing the factory" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev after they entered the factory, becoming detached from labor and workers. Some pursued bourgeois fame and wealth, shut themselves up to design, and ended up achieving nothing. The broad masses of workers were very dissatisfied with this situation.

After the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, workers posted big-character posters, strongly demanding that technical personnel leave the office buildings and go to the production teams to work and design with the workers. However, some technical personnel, deeply poisoned by the reactionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, said: "Design is the first process of production, so technical staff are not off-duty cadres and should not be included in the list of those to be streamlined and sent down." Just as this issue was being debated, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "following the path of cultivating technical personnel from among workers as exemplified by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory" were issued. Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the report on the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory greatly inspired and deeply educated the broad masses of workers and technical personnel. Those technical personnel who previously thought they did not need to go to the workers were also greatly shocked in their thinking. They posted big-character posters overnight to celebrate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The factory's Revolutionary Committee seized this opportunity to mobilize all revolutionary workers, cadres, and technical personnel in the factory to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon. They fiercely exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory who had crazily promoted the reactionary revisionist line of "experts managing the factory." Revolutionary workers exposed the capitalist roaders in the factory, who had successively promoted three engineers, two of whom were remnants of the Kuomintang and one was a bourgeois intellectual with serious political and historical problems. The capitalist roaders in the factory also used a small car to pick up a political swindler and a released labor reform criminal, appointing him as a technician and letting him control the power of technological transformation. This scoundrel, under the guise of mechanizing foundry work and other innovation projects, swindled technical materials everywhere, traveled and played, wasting tens of millions of state funds, and in the end, accomplished nothing but a pile of scrap iron. During the Cultural Revolution, a technical staff member of worker origin took the lead in designing, with a university graduate and a technical school graduate as assistants, and together with the masses of workers, relying on the active application of Mao Zedong Thought, completed the mechanization of foundry work in just nine months, which a reactionary technician had failed to achieve in four years. The living example of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two paths in the technical team deeply educated the broad revolutionary workers. The vast majority of technical personnel expressed their determination to firmly follow the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and eagerly requested to go to the teams to participate in labor, thoroughly transforming their worldviews in the process of uniting with the masses of workers.

Some technical personnel had many concerns before going to the teams. Some were afraid of being looked down upon by the workers, and some were afraid of making mistakes in operation. However, after arriving at the teams, they were warmly welcomed and helped by the workers. Some workers took the initiative to talk with the technical personnel, helping them improve their political awareness. When technical personnel were not familiar with actual operations, workers taught them step by step, deeply moving them. Some technical personnel have already tasted the sweetness of uniting with the workers and have begun to establish class feelings with them.

Now, although the number of full-time technical personnel in the factory has decreased, technological innovations are booming. After streamlining the organization and sending down office personnel in August, the factory created a high production record since its establishment.

Recently, the factory's Revolutionary Committee has held a Mao Zedong Thought study class attended by workers and all types of intellectuals in the factory. They have deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals and the various proletarian policies proposed in the editorial note of the September 5 issue of the Red Flag magazine, and have made further plans for the re-education of all types of intellectuals in the factory.

    内蒙古动力机械厂认真落实毛主席的最新指示
    全面安排知识分子的再教育问题
    全厂技术人员已分期分批下放到班组当工人，暂不下放的也深入到班组，一面参加劳动，一面和工人一起搞设计和技术革新。同时，选拔了一批有实践经验的工人充实了技术队伍
    据新华社呼和浩特十九日电　伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”呼和浩特市内蒙古动力机械厂革命委员会和广大革命工人，在深入进行斗、批、改中，及时抓住全厂技术队伍的改造问题，把全厂从高等及中等学校毕业的技术人员分期分批下放到生产班组当工人。暂不下放的技术人员，也深入到各个班组，一面参加劳动，一面和工人一起搞设计和技术革新，使知识分子和工人群众相结合。同时，这个厂还选拔一批有实践经验的工人充实了技术队伍。伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子再教育问题的最新指示发表后，厂革委会和全厂革命职工欢欣鼓舞，闻风而动，他们对全厂知识分子，包括党政干部中的知识分子的再教育问题，作出了全面安排。
    内蒙古动力机械厂是有一千多名职工的生产柴油机的工厂。文化大革命以前，厂内一小撮走资派竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线。他们让几个有严重政治历史问题的反动技术“权威”掌握全厂技术领导大权，排挤工人出身的技术员。对历年分配来的大、中学校毕业生，绝大多数直接放在科室和厂部搞设计和技术管理工作。这些由资产阶级知识分子教育出来的学生，到工厂以后，又受到中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”反革命修正主义路线的毒害，脱离劳动，脱离工人，有的追求资产阶级名利，闭门造车搞设计，结果一事无成。广大工人群众对这种现象非常不满。
    厂革委会成立后，工人群众纷纷贴出大字报，强烈要求技术人员走出办公楼，到生产班组中，和工人一起劳动，一起搞设计。但一些受中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义办企业路线毒害较深的技术人员却说：设计是生产的第一道工序，因此技术员不是脱产干部，不应包括在精简下放之列。正在辩论这个问题的时候，毛主席的“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的最新指示发表了。毛主席的最新指示和上海机床厂的调查报告，给了广大工人群众和技术人员以极大的鼓舞和深刻的教育，那些原来认为不需要到工人中去的技术人员，思想上也引起了很大震动。他们连夜贴出欢呼毛主席最新指示的大字报。厂革委会抓住这个时机，发动全厂革命的工人、干部、技术人员以毛主席最新指示为强大思想武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人疯狂推行“专家治厂”反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。革命职工揭露本厂走资派，先后提拔了三个工程师，两个是国民党的残渣余孽，一个是有严重政治历史问题的资产阶级知识分子。厂内走资派还把一个政治骗子、劳改释放犯用小汽车接来，封为技师，让他掌管技术改造大权。这个家伙以搞铸工机械化和其他革新项目为名，到处骗取技术资料，游山玩水，浪费国家资金数十万元，最后什么也没搞成，落得一堆废铁。在文化大革命中，由一个工人出身的技术员主持设计，一个大学生和一个中专毕业生当助手，同工人群众一起，靠活学活用毛泽东思想搞技术改造，仅仅九个月，就把那个反动技师搞了四年没有搞成的铸工机械化搞成了。技术队伍中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的活生生的事实，使广大革命职工受到深刻的教育。绝大多数技术人员都表示要坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵相结合的道路，纷纷要求下班组参加劳动，在同工人群众结合的过程中，彻底改造自己的世界观。
    有些技术人员下班组以前有不少顾虑，有的怕工人瞧不起，有的怕操作不好出乱子。但是，到了班组以后，却受到工人群众的热情欢迎和帮助。有些工人主动找技术人员谈心，帮助他们提高政治觉悟。技术人员实际操作不熟悉，工人就把着手教，使他们深受感动。有些技术员已经尝到了和工人结合的甜头，开始和工人建立起阶级感情。
    现在，这个厂的专职技术人员虽然减少了，技术革新却搞得热火朝天，精简机构和下放科室人员后的八月份，全厂生产创造了建厂以来的高产纪录。
    最近，厂革委会又举办了有工人群众和全厂各类知识分子参加的毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习毛主席关于知识分子再教育问题的最新指示，学习九月五日发表的《红旗》杂志编者按中提出的各项无产阶级政策，对全厂各类知识分子的再教育问题作出了进一步规划。
