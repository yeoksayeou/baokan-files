The day after the Revolutionary Committee of Shenyang Province's Shenyuan County was established, all the committee members collectively visited the 10th Company of a certain air force unit. This was not a routine visit; they came specifically to inspect the "Military-Civilian Class Education Exhibition Room" set up by the 10th Company.

The exhibition room, though consisting of only two modest small rooms, had a significant impact. People from within a radius of a hundred or two hundred miles came to visit. Some brought their own food and walked for two days, while others hitched rides on carts, traveling long distances, all eager to return home with a sense of revolutionary fervor.

In addition to the exhibition, the comrades from the 10th Company also organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes tailored to the current thoughts of the masses. They helped the masses arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses. People praised the 10th Company as the "broadcast station" for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the "promotion station" for revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and the "fueling station" for class struggle.

The 10th Company is stationed in the Bajiabu Production Brigade. The original brigade leader, Wang Liange, is an old hired laborer in his fifties. From the land reform to the present, he has been a cadre for over a dozen years. For more than a decade, he has always carried a hoe in spring and summer, inspecting rice fields; in autumn, he carried a sickle, participating in the harvest; in winter, he carried a basket, picking up manure along the way, diligently working for the collective. A handful of unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists harbored grudges against him and, during the Cultural Revolution, used his work shortcomings to launch a brutal struggle against him. However, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants firmly supported him. When discussing the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, everyone nominated him to participate in the three-in-one combination. He himself had some reservations and was not very willing to take on the role.

One night, the company commander, Cai Jun'an, and the platoon leader, Zhao Shiyou, came to his home. The three class brothers sat on the edge of the kang (a traditional Chinese heated bed) and began to talk. Commander Cai asked Wang Liange, "How did people in the old society address you?" This question stirred up Wang Liange's memories. How could he forget that in the old society, his family had been hired laborers for three generations, and he had either carried tools or begged for food since childhood? In winter, with no shoes to wear, he warmed his feet in a pile of cow dung, and people called him "Wang Beggar." Thinking of these things, he couldn't help but shed tears. Commander Cai continued, "Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of political power. The masses want to elect us to hold the reins, and we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions!" Commander Cai talked with him for three nights. The bitterness of class struggle opened Wang Liange's eyes. Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes." Commander Cai hurriedly gave Wang Liange a copy of the latest instruction. The latest instruction made Wang Liange recall the fierce struggles with class enemies during the land reform, greatly enhancing his revolutionary spirit and fighting will.

From then on, people often saw Wang Liange with his hoe, sickle, and basket. But the difference was that Wang Liange now wielded the hoe and sickle to grasp class struggle. In spring, he discovered that some teams had a tendency to cultivate small plots of land. He thought that there must be a reason behind this trend, so he led the poor and lower-middle peasants to the 10th Company's class education exhibition room, personally leading the way in recalling past sufferings, and together with the community members, fiercely criticized the crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the "Three Freedoms and One Contract." "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The poor and lower-middle peasants exposed a rich farmer element who incited the cultivation of small plots of land. The masses' awareness was raised, and socialist enthusiasm was mobilized, handing over the small plots of land to the production teams. Despite facing wind, hail, and drought disasters, everyone actively replanted and supported the seedlings, and in the struggle, welcomed another bountiful harvest.

On the day the Shenyuan County Revolutionary Committee was established, the 10th Company traveled a long distance to participate in the celebration meeting. The broad masses repeatedly requested that all the soldiers of the company be seated on the stage. The cadres and soldiers humbly said, "We are the people's children, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our sacred duty."

### 毛泽东思想的“传播站”

    毛泽东思想的“传播站”
    辽宁省岫岩县革命委员会成立的第二天，革委会的全体委员集体来到空军某部十连。这不是一次一般的访问，他们是专门来参观十连举办的“军民阶级教育展览室”的。
    展览室虽然只有两间简陋的小房子，影响却很大。驻地周围一二百里的群众都来参观。他们有的带着干粮走两天，有的套上马车长途跋涉，一个个风尘仆仆地赶来，充满战斗的激情回去。
    除了举办展览，十连同志还结合群众的活思想，办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，帮助群众用毛泽东思想来武装自己，受到广大群众的欢迎。人们称赞十连是毛主席最新指示的“传播站”，革命大联合三结合的“促进站”，阶级斗争的“加油站”。
    十连驻地巴家卜生产大队原大队长王连格是个五十多岁的老雇农，从土改到现在，他当了十几年干部。十几年来，他总是春夏扛把锹，挨队检查水稻田；秋天夹把镰，逐队参加收割；冬天背个筐，走一路拾一路粪，勤勤恳恳为集体。一小撮没有改造好的地富反坏右分子对他怀恨在心，在文化大革命中利用他工作上的一些缺点，对他进行残酷斗争。但是广大贫下中农坚决支持他，在酝酿成立革委会时，大家提名他参加三结合，他自己心里有些顾虑，不大愿意干。
    一天夜里，十连连长蔡俊安和班长赵士友来到他家。三个阶级兄弟坐在炕沿上谈开了。蔡连长问王连格：“旧社会人家怎么称呼你？”一句话，勾起了王连格的心头事。他怎能忘记，在旧社会他家是三代雇工，自己从小不是扛活就是要饭，冬天没鞋穿，把脚插在牛粪堆里取暖，人家都叫他“王要饭”。想到这些，他止不住眼泪直淌。蔡连长又说：“毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。群众要推举我们出来掌印把子，咱们得照毛主席的指示办事啊！”蔡连长一连同他谈了三夜。阶级的苦水擦亮了王连格的眼睛。毛主席发出了“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”的最新指示，蔡连长又连忙送给王连格。最新指示使王连格回想起土改时和阶级敌人的激烈搏斗，大大增强了革命的精神和战斗的勇气。
    从此，人们又经常看到王连格的一把锹、一把镰和一个粪筐。但不同的是，王连格拿的是锹镰，抓的是阶级斗争。春天，他发现有的队有一股开小片荒地的歪风。他想歪风必有来由，于是他把贫下中农领到十连的阶级教育展览室，自己带头忆苦，和社员一起猛批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”的罪行。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”贫下中农纷纷揭发煽动搞小片荒地的一个富农分子。群众的觉悟提高了，社会主义积极性调动起来，小片荒地交给了生产队。在遭到风、雹、旱灾的情况下，大家积极补苗、扶苗，在斗争中又迎来一个丰收年。
    岫岩县成立革委会那天，十连远道赶来参加庆祝大会。广大群众一再要请全连的战士都坐上主席台。干部、战士非常谦虚地说：“我们是人民子弟兵，宣传毛泽东思想是我们的神圣职责。”
