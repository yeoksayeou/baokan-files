Revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Railway Bureau fully play the role of the vanguard of the working class
Revolutionary production of the Fuxin Railway Bureau continues to achieve new victories

The workers' battle cry is: "No matter how much coal the mines produce, we will transport that much coal, and we will not affect the needs of industrial and agricultural production for coal due to railway transportation."

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 1st: The revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Railway Bureau in Liaoning Province have fully played the role of the vanguard of the working class in implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and have continuously achieved new victories.

Since this year, the twelve major transportation and production indicators of this bureau have been rising month by month. Especially since May, under the great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's reception of the representatives of the national railway and transportation conference, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers in the entire bureau has been renewed again and again, and all production indicators have increased significantly. The average daily loading volume in the second quarter increased by 28% compared to the first quarter; the unloading efficiency increased by 37%; the turnover time of freight cars was reduced from 1.62 days to 1.3 days, effectively supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production and construction in various places.

The Fuxin Railway Bureau is mainly responsible for transporting coal. On the nearly 700 kilometers of railway lines under its jurisdiction, there are three large mining areas: Fuxin, Beipiao, and Pingzhuang, with about 20 coal mines. The amount of coal loaded accounts for 88% of the total loading volume of the entire bureau. Every day, large quantities of coal are continuously transported from here to various cities and regions, supporting industrial and agricultural production and construction.

The revolutionary workers of this bureau, in order to excellently complete the glorious and arduous task of "grasp revolution, promote production," have always adhered to Chairman Mao's great teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and that political work is the lifeline of all economic work. They have always insisted on using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production. Every segment, work area, and station in the entire bureau are places for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and battlefields for revolutionary criticism. The broader masses of workers, the more they deeply criticize counter-revolutionary revisionism, the more they love, believe in, worship, and are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, their revolutionary enthusiasm is also greater. They say: "Every car of coal we load is a token of our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao." The workers have put forward a magnificent battle cry: "No matter how much coal the mines produce, we will transport that much coal, and we will not affect the needs of industrial and agricultural production for coal due to railway transportation."

In the great criticism of the revolution, the revolutionary workers severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, and broke the shackles of foreign dogmas and old frameworks, effectively promoting the development of transportation and production. The workers actively took effective measures, organized direct trains, and tried to achieve full load and overloading, pulling more and faster. Since early June, Fuxin Station alone has organized 166 direct trains, greatly reducing the stopping time at intermediate stations and delivering the coal to users in advance.

In the past, locomotive drivers who achieved full load and overloading were interfered with by the capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary "experts" in technology. They only saw the mechanical factors and used various "scientific coefficients" and "traction calculations" to restrict them. Now, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers have combined their sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm with a strict scientific spirit, fully exploiting the potential of the locomotives. The locomotive drivers say: "Every time before we start, we insist on studying Chairman Mao's quotations, with red hearts, brave minds, and strong strength, driving the trains without obstacles." The driver of locomotive No. 5073, He Shiqin, used to be able to pull only 3,200 tons. Now, on lines with relatively steep slopes, He Shiqin's locomotive has already pulled 99 freight cars, with a maximum load of 5,230 tons. The number of overloaded trains in the entire bureau is increasing, and the records of full load and overloading are being continuously broken.

To quickly transport coal to various places and support national production and construction, the workers of this bureau have thought of various ways to transport the produced coal out in time. On one day in July, they promised to provide 250 cars for the Fuxin Coal Mine. However, as the loading time approached, four cars were still missing. In this situation, the old worker Tian Yuming thought: "If we don't solve the problem of these four cars, 200 tons of coal won't be transported out, and the factory's production will be affected, which means we haven't completed the task of 'grasp revolution, promote production' given to us by Chairman Mao." After he shared his thoughts with his fellow workers, everyone felt that Tian Yuming had spoken for them. Therefore, everyone launched a battle to repair the vehicles and dedicate their loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the dark night, everyone fought for 150 minutes under the lamp light, finally repairing the four damaged cars. They not only transported the coal out in time but also ensured that the locomotive departed on time.

### 广大革命职工充分发挥工人阶级的主力军作用  阜新铁路分局革命生产不断取得新胜利

    广大革命职工充分发挥工人阶级的主力军作用
    阜新铁路分局革命生产不断取得新胜利
    职工们的战斗口号是：“煤矿生产多少煤炭，我们就运出多少煤炭，决不因铁路运输而影响工农业生产对煤炭的需要。”
    新华社沈阳一日电　辽宁省阜新铁路分局广大革命职工，充分发挥工人阶级主力军的作用，在贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，不断取得新的胜利。
    今年以来，这个分局十二项主要运输生产指标，逐月上升。特别是五月以来，在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见全国铁路、交通会议代表的特大喜讯鼓舞下，全分局的工人阶级革命干劲一鼓再鼓，各项生产指标都有大幅度上升。二季度平均日装车量比一季度提高百分之二十八；卸车效率提高百分之三十七；货车周转时间由一点六二天缩短到一点三一天，有力地支援了无产阶级文化大革命和各地的生产建设。
    阜新铁路分局主要担负运输煤炭的任务。在它管辖的将近七百公里的铁道线上，分布有阜新、北票、平庄三个大矿区，共二十来个煤矿。煤炭装车量占全分局总装车量的百分之八十八。每天都有大批的煤炭从这里源源不断地运到若干城市和地区，支援工农业生产建设。
    这个分局的广大革命职工，为了出色地完成抓革命、促生产的光荣而艰巨的任务，他们遵照毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂和政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线的伟大教导，始终坚持以革命来统帅生产，以革命来促进生产。全分局各段、工区、车站，到处是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，到处是革命大批判的战场。广大工人群众越是深批反革命修正主义，越是对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。因此，革命干劲也就越大。他们说：“我们多装运一车煤炭，就是对伟大领袖毛主席多献一分忠心。”职工们提出了豪迈的战斗口号：“煤矿生产多少煤炭，我们就运出多少煤炭，决不因铁路运输而影响工农业生产对煤炭的需要。”
    广大革命职工在革命的大批判中，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大破洋教条、旧框框，有力地推动运输生产的发展。职工们积极采取有效措施，编组直达列车，尽量做到满载超轴，多拉快跑。仅阜新站从六月初到八月二十日，就编组了一百六十六列直达列车，从而大大减少中间站停车，提前把煤炭送到用户。
    过去机车司机搞满载超轴，分局党内走资派和反动的技术“权威”横加干涉。他们看不见人的因素，仅仅用什么“科学系数”、“牵引计算”等等洋教条来进行限制。现在广大革命职工在毛泽东思想的指引下，把冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学精神结合起来，充分发挥了机车的效能。机车司机们说：“我们每次在开车前坚持学习毛主席语录，心红胆大力气壮，开起车来所向披靡无阻挡。”五○七三号机车的司机何世勤开的机车，过去规定只能拉三千二百吨，他总觉得机车的潜力没有充分发挥出来。现在，在坡度较大的线路上，何世勤开的机车已经挂到了九十九节货车，最多拉五千二百三十吨。全分局超轴列车越来越多，满载超轴的纪录不断被刷新。
    为了尽快地把煤炭运送到各地，支援国家生产建设，这个分局的工人阶级想尽各种办法，把生产出来的煤炭及时运出来。七月份的一天，他们答应给阜新煤矿二百五十个车。但是快到装车时间了，还缺四个车没着落。在这种情况下，老工人田玉明想：
  “四个车不解决，二百来吨煤炭就运不出去，工厂的生产就要受到影响，这就没有很好地完成毛主席交给我们的抓革命、促生产的任务。”他把自己的想法和同班的战友说了以后，大家都感到田玉明说出了自己的心里话。于是，大家便展开了一场向毛主席献忠心的抢修车辆的战斗。在漆黑的夜里，大家借助灯光奋战了一百五十分钟，终于把四个坏车修复，不仅把煤炭及时运出，而且保证了机车正点发车。
