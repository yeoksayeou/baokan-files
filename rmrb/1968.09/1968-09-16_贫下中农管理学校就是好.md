The great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" is the greatest trust, the greatest concern, the greatest support, and the greatest encouragement for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We firmly support it and will definitely carry it out.

Our Kangtun Production Brigade Party Branch, following Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on the proletarian educational revolution, established a poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee in 1962 to directly participate in the leadership of the brigade's primary school. We regularly study and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and address major issues in school management, continuously improving the school's management. Representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants also regularly inspect and guide the school. Some old poor peasants who suffered greatly before liberation regularly go to the school to conduct bitter-sweet education, teach agricultural technology, and help students master agricultural production knowledge, which has been warmly praised by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

However, a handful of class enemies are terrified and hateful of the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools. They secretly spread rumors, saying things like, "Schools have always been run by educated people. How can farmers understand? Can they run a school?" The capitalist roaders above also create countless obstacles, attempting to dismantle the poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee. Our brigade's Party Branch led the poor and lower-middle peasants to resist this countercurrent. Under the Party Branch's leadership, the members of the poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletarian educational revolution. They realized that whoever controls the school trains successors for that class and serves that class. Now, under Chairman Mao's leadership, it is the era of the working class and peasants. In the countryside, having the poor and lower-middle peasants in charge of the school is the only way to train successors who are needed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and truly serve socialist causes. We must reverse the history of the bourgeoisie and landlord class ruling the schools. After a fierce struggle, we finally smashed the class enemies' sabotage plots, making the poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee stronger and more consolidated.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." We poor and lower-middle peasants are the most capable of grasping Chairman Mao's educational policies and lines. In 1965, according to the enrollment plan, we could not solve the problem of all school-age children attending school. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "In the old society, our children could not go to school. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have been liberated. No matter what, we must let our children study to become socially conscious, cultured laborers." The poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee, based on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' demands, decided to open a people's class, adhering to the principle of frugal education, solving the problem of desks and chairs by ourselves, and selecting politically reliable and respected people among the poor and lower-middle peasants to be teachers, finally ensuring that all school-age children could attend school. In addition, the school also opened a night school for educated youth, training accountants and agricultural technicians for the production teams. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is good. Open the doors to the poor and lower-middle peasants and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee led revolutionary teachers and students to launch a revolutionary criticism and clean-up of the class ranks, firmly striking down a handful of class enemies, ensuring that the school's management power is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Through several years of practice, we have come to realize that Chairman Mao's latest directives are extremely brilliant and correct. In China's countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage schools and definitely can manage schools well. We must seriously study and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, summarize the experiences and lessons from managing schools in the past, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools, and push the proletarian educational revolution to the end, making the school a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 贫下中农管理学校就是好

    贫下中农管理学校就是好
    辽宁省革命委员会委员、台安县新开河公社康屯大队民兵指导员齐桂华
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的教导，是对我们贫下中农的最大信任，最大关怀，最大支持，最大鼓舞，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    我们康屯大队党支部，遵照毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的光辉指示，一九六二年就组织了贫下中农办学管理委员会，直接参与大队小学的领导工作，定期研究学校贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线和办学中的一些重大问题，不断改善学校的管理工作。贫下中农代表也定期到学校检查指导。解放前苦大仇深的一些老贫农，定期到学校对革命师生进行忆苦思甜教育，上农业技术课，帮助学生掌握农业生产知识，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈赞扬。
    可是，一小撮阶级敌人对贫下中农管理学校怕得要死，恨得要命，他们在暗地煽阴风，点鬼火，胡说什么“学校历来是有文化的人办的，庄稼汉懂得什么，他们能办学吗？”上边的走资派也百般刁难，妄图砍掉贫下中农办学管理委员会。我们大队的党支部领导贫下中农顶住了这股逆流。在党支部的领导下，贫下中农办学管理委员会的委员们，反复学习毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的教导，认识到，那个阶级掌握学校，就为那个阶级培养接班人，就为那个阶级服务。现在是毛主席领导的工农大众的天下，工人阶级是国家的领导阶级。在农村，由贫下中农掌握学校大权，才能培养出为贫下中农所需要的、真正能为社会主义服务的无产阶级革命事业接班人。我们就是要把资产阶级、地主阶级统治学校的历史颠倒过来。经过一场激烈的斗争，终于粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，使贫下中农办学管理委员会越来越坚强，越来越巩固。
    毛主席指出：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。我们贫下中农最能掌握毛主席的办学方针和办学路线。一九六五年，按照招生计划，不能解决全部适龄儿童入学的问题，贫下中农说：“旧社会我们的孩子不能上学。毛主席领导我们翻了身，说什么也得让孩子念书，当有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”贫下中农办学管理委员会根据广大贫下中农的要求，决定开办一个民办班，本着勤俭办学的方针，自己动手，解决了桌椅板凳，并且挑选政治可靠、在贫下中农中有威信的人当老师，终于使适龄儿童都入了学。此外，学校还开办了知识青年夜校，为生产队培养会计和农业技术员。广大贫下中农说：“贫下中农管理学校就是好，向贫下中农开门，为贫下中农服务。”
    毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们大队贫下中农办学管理委员会领导革命师生，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，使学校的管理大权牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。
    通过几年来的实践，我们体会到，毛主席的最新指示，无比英明，无比正确。在我国农村，贫下中农必须管理学校，也一定能够管理好学校。我们一定要认真学习、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，总结过去管理学校的经验教训，认真搞好学校的斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
