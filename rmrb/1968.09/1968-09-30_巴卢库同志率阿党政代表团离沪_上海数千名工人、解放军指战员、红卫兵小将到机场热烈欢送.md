An Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Bekir Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense of the People's Republic of Albania, departed from Shanghai this morning. Accompanying them were Comrade Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Comrade Wang Xinting, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, among others. Thousands of workers, PLA soldiers, and Red Guards from Shanghai gathered at the airport to give them a warm send-off, expressing their fervent revolutionary friendship with the closest comrades from the "Land of the Eagles."

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Wang Shaoyong, Ma Tianhui, Wang Chenglong, and Feng Guozhu, along with responsible officials from the PLA's land, sea, and air forces in Shanghai, such as Liu Wenxue, Duan Dezhang, and Wang Weiguo, as well as representatives from the Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, were also present at the airport to bid farewell to the Albanian delegation.

Early in the morning, the crowd at the airport held high portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people. They waved the national flags of both countries. When Comrade Baluku and his delegation arrived at the airport, the crowd erupted in enthusiastic cheers and the sound of drums and gongs. The airport, adorned with red flags, was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere of solidarity and unity between the two peoples. The crowd waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," repeatedly shouting slogans such as, "Warmly send off the Albanian party and government delegation!" "Long live the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!"

The Albanian comrades waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and circled the field before Comrade Baluku and his delegation shook hands with the Chinese comrades who came to see them off and waved to the crowd.

Also present at the airport to bid farewell were responsible members from various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, as well as representatives of the Five Good Soldiers from the PLA units stationed in Shanghai and representatives from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Today, Albanian students studying in Shanghai also came to the airport to see off the delegation.
