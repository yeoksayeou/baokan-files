Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!
— The Czechoslovak People Love Chairman Mao

“We miss Chairman Mao, we want to follow Chairman Mao in revolution!” This is the wish expressed by a Czechoslovak friend in a letter to Chinese comrades.

The Czechoslovak people want revolution. Chinese comrades who have been to Czechoslovakia, recalling their experiences there, are deeply moved. What impressed them most was that the revolutionary Czechoslovak people have boundless love for the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In Czechoslovakia, wherever Chinese comrades went, many revolutionary masses would gather around them, asking for Chairman Mao’s badges, and shouting, “Great Mao Zedong!” “Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!”

We Love Mao Zedong

One day, a Czechoslovak office worker saw a Chinese comrade wearing a shining gold Mao Zedong badge. He immediately ran up to the Chinese comrade and proudly said, “I also have two Mao Zedong badges and a book of Chairman Mao’s works, which I got from Chinese comrades three years ago. For more than three years, I have been studying Chairman Mao’s great work repeatedly. I will keep the Mao Zedong badge forever.” After saying this, he firmly shook hands with the Chinese comrade and said in Chinese, “Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!”

In Czechoslovakia, there is a young couple who have long wished to obtain a Mao Zedong badge. However, under the white terror of the Czechoslovak revisionist clique, their wish has not been fulfilled for a long time. One day, they met several Chinese comrades on the street and bravely walked up to them, saying, “We love Mao Zedong! We have known for a long time that you have Mao Zedong badges. We have long wanted to get one, but we have never had the opportunity. Can you fulfill our wish today?” When the Chinese comrades gave them the shining gold Mao Zedong badges, the couple was extremely excited and shouted, “Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!”

Heartfelt Wish for Chairman Mao’s Longevity

A Czechoslovak worker who loves Chairman Mao and socialist New China very much said to Chinese comrades, “Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us not to forget class struggle, which is extremely important. Class and class struggle objectively exist, but the modern revisionists led by Khrushchev deny it, resulting in the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, New China has a very strong atmosphere of socialist revolution.” This worker is very concerned about the health of our great leader, Chairman Mao. When Chinese comrades told him that Chairman Mao is in very good health, he immediately said happily, “This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life!”

Chinese comrades who have been to Czechoslovakia often received letters from Czechoslovak friends during their stay. In these letters, Czechoslovak friends expressed their love and admiration for our great leader, Chairman Mao; they expressed their strong desire to obtain Chairman Mao’s works and Mao Zedong badges. A young Czechoslovak friend wrote in a letter, “I respect our leader Mao Zedong very much and hope to get a German edition of ‘Quotations from Chairman Mao.’ Please fulfill my request. Long Live Mao Zedong!” Another Czechoslovak friend wrote in a letter, “I urgently hope to get Chairman Mao’s works so that I can study and master the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong.”

We Must Follow the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and dogmatism. The broad Czechoslovak revolutionary people, in their struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership and against the Czechoslovak revisionist clique’s restoration of capitalism, gradually realized that to achieve thorough victory, they must learn and master Mao Zedong Thought and follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

A Czechoslovak teacher, after reading “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” deeply felt and said to Chinese comrades, “Every word of Comrade Mao Zedong is truth. I firmly believe that the revolutionary people of the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will surely achieve victory.” A Czechoslovak youth said, “I believe in Mao Zedong, I love Mao Zedong, and I admire his great thoughts because the development of the current world political situation has repeatedly proven that the foresight and scientific judgments of Comrade Mao Zedong are great truths. The Czechoslovak people will eventually follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao.”

We Will Continue the Revolution, Forever Revolution

In a certain city in Czechoslovakia, two retired old workers had a lot to say to Chinese comrades. One evening, they happened to meet Chinese comrades and said excitedly, “We came to find you for no other reason but that you are from New China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.” They also said, “The modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership are desperately opposing New China, but we want to be friends with China and shake hands with Chinese comrades. We want to love Comrade Mao Zedong.” At this point, one of the old workers who had participated in the anti-fascist war pointed to his missing teeth and said, “Look, my lower teeth were knocked out by Hitler’s bandits in a German concentration camp. We will never forget the past. But the modern revisionists are desperately pulling us back to capitalism, and we workers will never agree! We want to continue the revolution, to revolution forever, and we want to follow the socialist path defended and upheld by Comrade Mao Zedong.”

    毛泽东同志万岁！
    ——捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱毛主席
    “我们想念毛主席，我们要紧跟毛主席干革命！”这是一位捷克斯洛伐克朋友，在给中国同志的一封信中表达的心愿。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民是要革命的。曾经到过捷克斯洛伐克的中国同志，今天回忆起他们在捷克斯洛伐克的所见所闻，都感到非常激动。给他们印象最深的是，革命的捷克斯洛伐克人民无限热爱无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在捷克斯洛伐克，中国同志无论走到哪里，那里的许多革命群众就围拢过来，向他们要毛主席像章，对着他们高呼：“伟大的毛泽东！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”
      我们热爱毛泽东
    一天，一位捷克斯洛伐克的机关工作人员，看见中国同志胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，他立刻跑到中国同志面前自豪地说：“我也有两枚毛泽东同志的像章，还有一本毛主席著作，是三年前从中国同志那里得到的。三年多来，我一直反复学习毛主席的这部伟大著作，毛主席像章我要永远保存下去。”他说了这番话以后，紧握中国同志的手，用中国话说：“毛泽东同志万岁！”
    在捷克斯洛伐克，有一对年轻的夫妇，很早就渴望得到毛主席像章，可是在捷修叛徒集团的白色恐怖下，他们的愿望很久没有实现。一天，他们在马路上遇到几个中国同志，便大胆地走了过去，对中国同志说：“我们热爱毛泽东！我们早就知道你们有毛泽东像章，我们很想得到它，可是一直没有机会得到，今天你们能满足我们的要求吗？”当中国同志把金光闪闪的毛主席像章送给他们的时候，这一对夫妇非常兴奋地欢呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！”
      衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆
    一位非常热爱毛主席，非常热爱社会主义新中国的捷克斯洛伐克工人，对中国同志说：“毛泽东同志教导我们不要忘记阶级斗争，这是极其重要的教导。阶级和阶级斗争是客观存在的，可是赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者否认它，结果导致了资本主义在苏联的复辟。与此相反，毛泽东同志领导下的新中国，社会主义革命的气氛却是很浓很浓的。”这位工人十分关心我们伟大领袖毛主席的身体健康，当中国同志告诉他毛主席的身体非常非常健康的时候，他立即高兴地说：“这是中国人民的最大幸福，也是世界革命人民的最大幸福。我衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！”
    曾经到过捷克斯洛伐克的中国同志，在捷克斯洛伐克期间，经常收到许多捷克斯洛伐克朋友的来信。捷克斯洛伐克朋友在来信中，向中国同志表达了他们对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和敬仰；表达了他们渴望得到毛主席著作和毛主席像章的强烈愿望。一位年轻的捷克斯洛伐克朋友在信中说：“我很尊敬我们的领袖毛泽东，希望得到一本德文版的《毛主席语录》，请满足我的要求。毛泽东万岁！”另一位捷克斯洛伐克朋友在来信中说：“我迫切希望得到毛主席著作，以便学习和掌握毛泽东同志的思想。”
      必须走毛主席指引的道路
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。广大的捷克斯洛伐克革命人民，在反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，在反对捷修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的斗争中，逐渐地认识到：要取得彻底的胜利，必须学习和掌握毛泽东思想，必须走毛主席指引的道路。
    一位捷克斯洛伐克教员在读了《毛主席语录》以后，很有感触地对中国同志说：“毛泽东同志的话句句是真理。我坚信，世界革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，革命就一定能取得胜利。”一位捷克斯洛伐克青年说：“我相信毛泽东，我热爱毛泽东，我崇拜他的伟大思想，因为当前世界政治形势的发展，一再证明了毛泽东同志的英明预见和科学论断是伟大的真理。我们捷克斯洛伐克人民终将走毛主席所指引的道路。”
    我们要继续革命，永远革命
    在捷克斯洛伐克某城市，有两位退休老工人，他们有许多话要想对中国同志讲。一天晚上，他俩正好遇上中国同志，他们万分激动地对中国同志说：“我们来找你们没有别的原因，只是因为你们是来自毛泽东同志所领导的新中国。”他们还说：“以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，拚命地反对新中国，而我们就是要同中国友好，同中国同志握手，我们就是要热爱毛泽东同志。”说到这里，其中一个曾经参加过反法西斯战争的老工人指着自己残缺的牙齿说：“你们看，我下面的牙齿是在德国集中营里被希特勒匪徒打掉的，我们永远不会忘记过去。可是现代修正主义者，却拚命地把我们往资本主义拉，我们工人坚决不答应！我们要继续革命，要永远革命，我们要沿着毛泽东同志所捍卫和坚持的社会主义道路走下去。”
