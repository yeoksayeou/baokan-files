The Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team deeply loves the People's Liberation Army and has transferred the precious gift of mangoes presented by Chairman Mao to the military and people on the frontline in Fujian.

Fuzhou: On the 16th, 150,000 military personnel and civilians gathered to enthusiastically welcome the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's transfer of the precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao. They resolved to heighten revolutionary vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and vow to turn the southeastern coastal defense into an iron wall.

New China News Agency, Frontline in Fujian, September 19th: The Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team transferred the precious gift of mangoes presented by the great leader Chairman Mao to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian, who have made great contributions in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, safeguarding the country's maritime defense, and carrying out the "Three Supports and Two Military" tasks. On the morning of the 16th, the military and civilians on the frontline, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, held a grand meeting in Fuzhou to welcome the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's transfer of the precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao.

This time, the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team transferred the precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao, including mangoes from all the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Automobile Repair Company, which were transferred to the soldiers and officers of the three services on the frontline in Fujian. There were also mango replicas from the revolutionary masses of the first light industry system in Beijing, which were transferred to the revolutionary people of Fujian Province.

On the 16th, Fuzhou was filled with a festive atmosphere. Ten thousand military personnel and civilians from the three services on the frontline, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," holding high red flags, and beating drums, gathered at Wuyi Road Square. They chanted slogans such as, "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; the river is deep, the sea is deep, but class love is deeper. Chairman Mao is forever in our hearts!" "Learn from the working class! Salute the working class!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

The commander of the frontline forces in Fujian and the chairman of the Fujian Revolutionary Committee, Han Xianchu, and the deputy commander of the frontline forces in Fujian and the deputy chairman of the Fujian Revolutionary Committee, Pi Dingjun, accepted the most precious gift on behalf of the frontline forces and the Fujian Revolutionary Committee. At this moment, the entire scene was filled with joy, and a red wave surged through the crowd. The broad masses of military and civilians waved the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted for a long time, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

Amidst enthusiastic applause, Comrade Pi Dingjun spoke. He said: The Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team transferred the most precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao, the mangoes, to us, the soldiers and officers of the three services on the frontline in Fujian and the working class of Fujian Province. This is a manifestation of the great leader Chairman Mao and the working class of the capital's deep concern and ardent expectations for the military and civilians on the frontline. It is a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power and an invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest happiness and greatest glory for the 17 million military and civilians fighting on the frontline in Fujian. Comrade Pi Dingjun said, we will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." We will heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen preparedness, strengthen military-civilian unity, and do a good job in military-civilian joint defense. We will turn the southeastern coastal defense into an iron wall. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it! As long as the supreme commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will surely plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the sacred territory of Taiwan.

Comrade Pi Dingjun, on behalf of the three services on the frontline in Fujian and the working class of Fujian Province, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the Beijing Automobile Repair Company, and the revolutionary masses of the first light industry system in Beijing, and extended the highest combat salute to them.

The meeting passed a letter of thanks to the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the Beijing Automobile Repair Company, and the revolutionary masses of the first light industry system in Beijing. After the meeting, a grand parade was held.
