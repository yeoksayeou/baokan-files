To the Editor:

	Just as the mighty propaganda teams of workers carrying forth Mao Zedong Thought are marching into the schools, and a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is approaching, the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine published an extremely important editorial note and the investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical College: On the Educational Revolution in Technical and Scientific Universities." This further elucidates the brilliant thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao on the educational revolution, deeply educating and inspiring us!

	When we read about how workers and peasants, with the determination to "make the laboring people the masters of science and culture" and to "make Chairman Mao proud," entered the universities; when we read about how they wielded the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought to stage a proletarian rebellion in the "heavens," breaking through the numerous nets of the bourgeois educational system and making those "giant monsters" lose their arrogance; when we read about how they created one invention after another for socialism, we truly felt elated and delighted!

	Today, in the midst of the great struggle, criticism, and transformation, we see everywhere the broad masses of laboring people spirited, full of fighting spirit, and brimming with confidence. The working class not only wants to be the masters of science and culture but also, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, wants to unite with, educate, and transform the broad masses of intellectuals. The editorial note of the *Red Flag* magazine points out: "For the large number of graduates from colleges and middle schools who have been working and are currently working, we must pay attention to their re-education, so that they can unite with the workers and peasants." This is a major task to thoroughly purge the poisonous influence of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to prevent revisionism. This is a serious struggle to transform people. The working class will use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide all intellectuals who can be united and transformed onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, helping them to free themselves from the influence of bourgeois ideology and replace the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview. This is part of the great cause of communism. "When the world reaches the time when all humanity consciously transforms itself and the world, that will be the era of communism." The working class will definitely strive to complete this great historical mission. All revolutionary intellectuals and those who are willing to be revolutionary must see the laws of historical development, accept the re-education of the working class, resolutely take the path of uniting with the workers and peasants, and keep pace with the billions of revolutionary people advancing forward!

    知识分子要接受工人阶级的再教育
    编辑同志：
    正当浩浩荡荡的工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校，一个斗、批、改的新高潮正在到来的时候，《红旗》杂志第三期发表了极为重要的编者按和《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》的调查报告，进一步阐明了伟大领袖毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，使我们深受教育，深受鼓舞！
    当我们读到工农学生带着“劳动人民要成为科学文化的主人”，“要为毛主席争气”的决心走进大学；读到他们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，来了一场无产阶级的大闹“天宫”，冲破了资产阶级教育制度的重重罗网，使那些“庞然大物”威风扫地；读到他们为社会主义搞出了一项项发明创造的时候，真是扬眉吐气，大快人心！
    今天，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，到处可以看到广大劳动人民精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。工人阶级不但要做科学文化的主人，而且要按照毛主席的伟大教导，团结、教育、改造广大的知识分子。《红旗》杂志编者按指出：“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。”这是彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线流毒，反修防修的重大课题，这是改造人的一场严重斗争。工人阶级要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把一切可以团结改造的知识分子，引导到无产阶级革命轨道上来，帮助他们从资产阶级思想的影响下解放出来，用无产阶级的世界观代替资产阶级的世界观。这是共产主义伟大事业的一部分。“世界到了全人类都自觉地改造自己和改造世界的时候，那就是世界的共产主义时代。”工人阶级一定为完成这个伟大的历史使命而奋斗。一切革命的和愿意革命的知识分子，一定要看清历史发展的规律，接受工人阶级的再教育，坚决走同工农相结合的道路，跟上亿万革命人民前进的步伐！解放军一战士
