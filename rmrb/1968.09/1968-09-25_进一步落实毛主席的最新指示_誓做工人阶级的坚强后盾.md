One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the cultural revolution of the proletariat in North China, Central China, and East China. Reviewing the battle course of the cultural revolution and recalling Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions during the inspection, we feel especially close, and we cannot help but repeatedly shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the greatest!"

Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions during the inspection are great historical documents of Marxism-Leninism, guiding the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country to advance bravely. They are the beacon guiding the proletarian cultural revolution to achieve comprehensive victory, and the most powerful ideological weapon. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the people of the whole country, after repeated and fierce struggles, have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev and their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, achieving a red land throughout the country. The proletarian cultural revolution is entering the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the country. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao calls on us to fight against selfishness and revisionism, to support the army and love the people, to promote revolution and production, work, and preparedness, and to do all aspects of work better, to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. We, the entire support-left team of the 834th Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great battle call, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the support-left process, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, humbly learn from the working class, fight against selfishness and revisionism, resolutely take the path of "supporting the government and loving the people," use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, and help build a revolutionary government. Together with all the revolutionary masses of the factory, we vigorously promote revolution, vigorously promote production, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the Party organization, streamline institutions, transfer office personnel, and launch one revolutionary and production high tide after another, achieving one great victory after another. The practice of struggle most vividly and powerfully proves that by closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the revolution will be invincible.

Recently, Chairman Mao taught us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." In the process of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad masses of workers at the Beijing Knitting Factory, we deeply feel that the working class listens to Chairman Mao the most and implements Chairman Mao's instructions the most resolutely. Whenever Chairman Mao issues an instruction or the proletarian headquarters issues a battle call, they respond immediately and implement it resolutely. After Chairman Mao issued the call to achieve great unity in revolution during the inspection, they responded immediately, took the lead in leveling the heights, and the entire factory quickly achieved great unity in revolution by class. When Chairman Mao called for "promoting revolution and production," they vigorously promoted revolution and production, making the revolution and production in the entire factory flourish. When Chairman Mao recently called for workers, peasants, and soldiers to re-educate intellectuals, they acted swiftly, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes for re-educating intellectuals that very day, inviting old workers to be teachers, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of intellectuals. When Chairman Mao called for earnestly carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation, they immediately launched an unprecedented high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Fighting together with the broad masses of workers, we continuously draw rich political nutrition from the masses of workers, accelerating our ideological revolutionization.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally created and led, and Vice Chairman Lin directly commanded, the People's Liberation Army of China is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the strong backbone of the working class, and the iron wall defending the socialist motherland. In the great march to achieve comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, we must fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely be the strong backbone of the working class, launch a new high tide of the great struggle, criticism, and transformation mass movement, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    一年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席视察了华北、中南和华东地区的无产阶级文化大革命。回顾文化大革命的战斗历程，重温毛主席在视察时所作的一系列极为重要的指示，我们感到格外亲切，情不自禁地一遍遍高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    毛主席在视察时所作的一系列极为重要的指示，是马克思列宁主义的伟大历史文献，是指引全党、全军、全国人民奋勇前进的灯塔，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最强大的思想武器。全国军民在毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统一号令下，经过反复激烈的斗争，把隐藏在党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其推行的反革命修正主义路线彻底粉碎了，实现了全国山河一片红，无产阶级文化大革命正在全国范围内进入斗、批、改的阶段。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    毛主席号召我们：要斗私、批修，要拥军爱民，要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂毛泽东思想宣传队的全体支左人员，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的这一伟大战斗号令，在支左过程中活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，虚心向工人阶级学习，斗私批修，坚决走“拥政爱民”的道路，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，帮助群众建设革命政权。我们和全厂无产阶级革命派一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，深入持久地开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，整顿党的组织，精简机构，下放科室人员，掀起一个又一个革命和生产的新高潮，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。斗争实践最生动、有力地证明，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，革命就无往而不胜。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们在同北京针织总厂广大工人群众一起，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，并肩战斗的过程中，深切地体会到，工人阶级最听毛主席的话，对毛主席的指示执行最坚决。毛主席每一个指示，无产阶级司令部每一个战斗号令一下达，他们就闻风而动，坚决执行。毛主席在视察时发出关于要实现革命大联合的号召后，他们闻风而动，立即带头削平山头，全厂按班组迅速实现了革命大联合。毛主席号召“抓革命，促生产”，他们狠抓革命，猛促生产，全厂革命和生产蓬蓬勃勃。毛主席最近发出由工农兵对知识分子进行再教育的号召，他们又雷厉风行，当天办起对知识分子进行再教育的毛泽东思想学习班，请老工人当教员，促进知识分子的思想革命化。毛主席号召认真搞好斗、批、改，他们立即掀起了规模空前的斗、批、改新高潮。我们和广大工人群众共同战斗，不断从工人群众中吸取丰富的政治营养，加速了我们的思想革命化。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是工人阶级的强大后盾，是保卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，我们一定要全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决做工人阶级的强大后盾，掀起伟大的斗、批、改群众运动新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
