Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, the revolutionary committees of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City are established.

	200,000 soldiers and civilians gathered in Urumqi to express their heartfelt wishes for the eternal health of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups! The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region marks the further consolidation of proletarian dictatorship in the northwestern border of the motherland, the further strengthening of great unity among all ethnic groups in the country, and a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists, Mongolian revisionists, American imperialists, and Indian reactionaries. They are determined to, under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their thoughts, steps, and actions, grasp class struggle, smash all sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies, and defend the great socialist motherland.

	Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 6th—Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, and under the warm care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, amidst the triumphant songs of the nationwide military and civilian people in their comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comes the thrilling news from the northwestern border of the motherland, the frontline against the Soviet revisionists, American imperialists, and Indian reactionaries: the Revolutionary Committees of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City have been born in the great storms of class struggle.

	This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This great victory proclaims the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary plot of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the northwest and Xinjiang to restore capitalism in Xinjiang, marking the further consolidation of proletarian dictatorship in the northwestern border of the motherland and the further strengthening of great unity among all ethnic groups in the country. This great victory is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists, Mongolian revisionists, American imperialists, and Indian reactionaries!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have shown great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang. At every critical moment of the struggle, Chairman Mao has given extremely wise instructions, greatly encouraging and empowering the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

	The great teacher Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Xinjiang is located in the strategic position of the northwestern border of the motherland. Outside the border, there are provocations from the Soviet revisionists, Mongolian revisionists, American imperialists, and Indian reactionaries. Inside the border, there are sabotage activities by national separatist elements, traitors collaborating with foreign powers, remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. For a long time, China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, along with their agents in the northwest and Xinjiang such as Habibullah, Liu Lantao, Wu Guang, Lü Jianren, Zhang Zhonghan, Yiminuo, and Pao Keran, have colluded with domestic and foreign enemies to attempt to restore capitalism in Xinjiang. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and his latest instructions, have raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," launching sustained and fierce attacks on this handful of class enemies representing the interests of the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. After repeated and fierce struggles, they have repulsed the multiple counterattacks of China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, exposed their plots to incite the masses to fight among themselves and divert the direction of the struggle, dragged out this handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, smashed their counter-revolutionary dreams of restoring capitalism in Xinjiang, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	"Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." Under the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have undertaken the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." The broad officers and soldiers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, making great contributions to defending the border of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang.

	On September 5th, the city of Urumqi at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains was filled with joyous festive scenes. 200,000 revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surrounding the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, singing songs of praise for the great leader Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, singing and dancing, surged from all directions to the People's Square to enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City.

	The celebration meeting began with the majestic music of "The East is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the official establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Revolutionary Committee of Urumqi City, the entire venue was filled with the sound of drums and firecrackers, and the cheers were deafening. People repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!"

	On this joyous day, from the green oases of Hami to the Pamir Plateau, from the Ili Valley to the foot of the Karakorum Mountains, on this vast land of the border of the motherland, the eight million revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, using different ethnic languages, sincerely wished for the eternal health of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups! Eternal health! Eternal health!

	Comrade Long Shujin, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said, the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	Comrade Long Shujin said, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, there are countless tasks ahead. The most fundamental one is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, to further expand and deepen the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to unify thoughts, steps, and actions under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Comrade Long Shujin said, we must thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center is no center" theory of the bourgeoisie, overcome factionalism and mountainism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and three-in-one combination across systems, industries, and classes, and thoroughly smash the evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters.

	Comrade Long Shujin emphasized that we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," further carry out the revolutionary criticism, carefully clean up the class ranks, and accurately and firmly strike at a handful of class enemies.

	We must strengthen the awareness of the enemy, further carry out the "support the army and love the people" and "support the government and love the people" movements, strengthen the unity between the military and the people, the military and the government, and the unity among ethnic groups, be vigilant and smash all sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies, consolidate the border defense, and defend the great socialist motherland.

	Comrade Long Shujin said, we must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels, implement "streamlining and efficiency," and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses, to build the revolutionary committees at all levels into revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous command headquarters of the proletariat, further consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

	Comrade Long Shujin said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work must be fully brought into play." Xinjiang has more than 500,000 industrial workers. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, resolutely implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build Xinjiang into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	Comrade Guo Peng, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, spoke at the meeting on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, expressing their most resolute support and support for the newly born Revolutionary Committees of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City. He said, the People's Liberation Army of China is a great army personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, a strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "the rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," and be determined to be the strong rear of the revolutionary committees, resolutely strike at all sabotage activities of the class enemies. We must firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "summarizing achievements, correcting mistakes, and preparing for the next battle," further do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries," strengthen the unity between the military and the people, the military and the government, and the unity among ethnic groups, jointly fight against the enemy, consolidate the border defense, and make the northwestern border of the motherland an indestructible iron wall. If the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries dare to invade, we will "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them."

	Comrade Saifudin, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, also spoke at the meeting. He said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." We should always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, protect the unity of the motherland like protecting our eyes. Whoever dares to attempt to split the unity of our great motherland, we will resolutely overthrow them.

	Comrade Saifudin said, the plot of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to subvert our Xinjiang is part of their treacherous activities of collaborating with American imperialism and its running dogs to oppose communism, oppose China, and oppose the revolution of the people of all countries. The social-imperialist Soviet revisionist traitor clique can do any evil. We, the people of all ethnic groups, must be more closely united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, be highly vigilant, be prepared, and resolutely smash all the evil plots of the Soviet revisionists.

	Comrade Huang Yu, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Urumqi City, also spoke at the celebration meeting.

	Representatives of revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups spoke at the meeting. They expressed that the eight million revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, bravely defend the newly born proletarian revolutionary power, and be determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

	Comrades Wang Enmao, Pei Zhouyu, Li Quanchun, Yang Libie, Hu Liangcai, Ziya, and Wu Juleun, Vice Chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, members of the Revolutionary Committees of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City, and responsible comrades of the Xinjiang Military Region, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335th Unit participated in the celebration meeting.

	The meeting, amidst thunderous cheers and applause, passed a telegram of respect to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

	After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.

    在各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下
    新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市革委会成立
    二十万军民在乌鲁木齐集会，衷心祝愿各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！新疆维吾尔自治区革委会成立，标志着祖国西北边疆的无产阶级专政进一步巩固，国内各民族的大团结进一步加强，是对苏修、蒙修、美帝和印度反动派的沉重打击。他们决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，狠抓阶级斗争，粉碎国内外敌人的一切破坏活动，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国
    新华社乌鲁木齐六日电　在各族人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，从祖国西北边疆，反对苏修、美帝、印度反动派的前线，传来了振奋人心的喜讯：新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中同时胜利诞生了。
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这一伟大胜利，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北和新疆的代理人，妄图在新疆复辟资本主义的反革命罪恶阴谋彻底破产，标志着祖国西北边疆的无产阶级专政得到了进一步的巩固，国内各民族的大团结得到了进一步的加强。这一伟大胜利，是对苏修、蒙修、美帝和印度反动派的沉重打击！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，对新疆无产阶级文化大革命极为关怀。在斗争的每一个关键时刻，毛主席都作了非常英明的指示，给了新疆各族无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众以巨大的鼓舞，无穷的力量。
    伟大导师毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”新疆地处祖国西北边防，战略地位十分重要。在境外，有苏修、蒙修、美帝和印度反动派的挑衅，在境内，有民族分裂主义分子、里通外国分子和国民党反动派残渣余孽以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动，阶级斗争极其尖锐复杂。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在西北和新疆的代理人习仲勋、刘澜涛和武光、吕剑人、张仲瀚、伊敏诺夫、包尔汉等，同国内外敌人相勾结，妄图在新疆复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，新疆各族无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和一系列最新指示的指引下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向这一小撮代表美帝、苏修、国民党反动派和地、富、反、坏、右利益的阶级敌人，发动了持续的猛烈进攻。经过反复、激烈的大搏斗，打退了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的多次反扑，揭露了他们挑动群众斗群众、转移斗争大方向的阴谋，把这一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派揪了出来，粉碎了他们妄图在新疆复辟资本主义的反革命迷梦，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利！
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在伟大统帅毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召下，人民解放军驻新疆部队广大指战员和新疆军区生产建设兵团，担负起了“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。广大指战员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，为保卫祖国边疆和新疆的无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。
    九月五日，天山脚下的乌鲁木齐市，一派欢乐的节日景象。各族革命群众和人民解放军指战员二十万人，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，簇拥着毛主席的巨幅画像，高唱对伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌，敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞，从四面八方涌向人民广场，热烈庆祝新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会和乌鲁木齐市革命委员会正式成立时，全场锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，欢声雷动，人们一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在这大喜的日子里，从哈密绿洲到帕米尔高原，从伊犁河谷到喀喇昆仑山下，在祖国边疆这个辽阔土地上，各民族的八百万革命人民，用不同的民族语言，衷心敬祝各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会主任龙书金同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会的成立，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    龙书金同志说，革命委员会成立以后，工作千头万绪，最根本的一条，是活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，更广泛、更深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。龙书金同志说，我们要彻底批判资产阶级的反动的“多中心即无中心论”，克服宗派主义、山头主义，巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命三结合，彻底粉碎阶级敌人妄图破坏、分裂无产阶级司令部的罪恶阴谋。
    龙书金同志强调指出，我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，进一步开展革命大批判，认真清理阶级队伍，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。　　　　　　　　　
    要加强敌情观念，进一步开展“拥军爱民”、“拥政爱民”运动，加强军民团结、军政团结、民族团结，警惕和粉碎国内外敌人的一切破坏活动，巩固边防，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国。
    龙书金同志说，我们要坚决遵照毛主席的教导，加强各级革命委员会的建设，实行“精兵简政”，“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，把各级革命委员会建设成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    龙书金同志说，毛主席教导我们：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”新疆有五十多万产业工人，我们一定要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，认真搞好斗、批、改，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把新疆建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会副主任、新疆军区副司令员郭鹏同志，代表人民解放军驻新疆部队全体指战员在大会上讲话，对新生的新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会和乌鲁木齐市革命委员会表示最坚决的拥护和支持。他说，中国人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大军队，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。我们必须牢记毛主席的“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，誓作革命委员会的坚强后盾，坚决打击阶级敌人的一切破坏活动。我们一定要坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，遵照毛主席“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的伟大教导，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，加强军民团结、军政团结和民族团结，共同对敌，巩固边防，使祖国的西北边疆成为坚不可摧的钢铁长城。帝、修、反胆敢来犯，就“坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭之”。
    新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会副主任赛福鼎同志在大会上讲了话。他说，毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”我们应当时刻牢记毛主席的这一教导，象保护眼睛一样保护祖国的统一。谁胆敢企图分裂我们伟大祖国的统一，我们就坚决打倒谁。
    赛福鼎同志说，苏修叛徒集团妄图颠覆我国新疆的阴谋是它在国际上伙同美帝国主义及其走狗反共、反华、反对各国人民革命的背叛活动的一个组成部分。社会帝国主义的苏联修正主义叛徒集团是什么坏事都能做得出来的，我们各族人民一定要更紧密地团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，百倍警惕，做好准备，坚决粉碎苏修的一切罪恶阴谋。
