The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat began not long ago, and our troops' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered the Wuzhishan area of Hainan Island to carry out "three supports and two militaries" work. Over the past two years, we have personally witnessed that, through the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the Li people of Wuzhishan have come to love Chairman Mao even more, and they love reading Chairman Mao's books even more. Their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. The red hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Li ethnicity are like the mountain tea flowers of Wuzhishan, blooming redder and redder.

In a village called Shebian at the southern foot of Wuzhishan, there lives a 63-year-old old peasant named Huang Deshun. Everyone calls him the "old man with a red heart." After the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat began, a Mao Zedong Thought study class was established here, and the old man was the first to sign up. In the study class, the old man was the most active student. Every morning, before the rooster crows, he gets up and goes to the study class, lights a bright bamboo torch, takes out a white towel specially bought from six li away, and carefully wipes the frame of Chairman Mao's portrait clean. He tidies up the study class neatly. After doing all this, he bows deeply to Chairman Mao's portrait, then, under the light of the bamboo torch, puts on his old glasses, opens the book that he has read countless times, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and reads it word by word carefully. Only when the rooster crows the first time does he climb up the mountain to the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda platform, and bangs the deer skin drum loudly, shouting to the village, "The sun is rising! Gather at the study class! Show loyalty to Chairman Mao!"

In the study class, he is one of the most diligent students of Chairman Mao's works. He often says to people, "Chairman Mao is our Li family's great benefactor. Chairman Mao's books are our poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary treasure. Going up the mountain to hunt wolves without a gun is not possible, doing revolution without reading Chairman Mao's books is not possible!" Every morning and evening, and before and after meals, he puts on his old glasses and studies a few sections of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In his notebook, he draws circles and lines. When he encounters words he doesn't recognize, he asks the soldiers of the Liberation Army and the young people in the village, and he won't stop until he understands. Whenever the latest instructions from Chairman Mao are issued, he copies them down with his small notebook, word by word, studying them in the fields, by the stove before and after meals, and in the study class at night with a lamp. Now, the old man can recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and more than ten quotations from Chairman Mao fluently. He has also taught his wife to memorize seven quotations from Chairman Mao. The people in the village praise him, saying, "The cypress trees on the mountain are greener and greener, and the old man's heart is redder and redder. He has become the most active old student in our study class!"

Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes has helped the old man understand many revolutionary truths. He often says happily, "I've lived for decades, and now I can go to school. It's all thanks to Chairman Mao!" Therefore, he is particularly concerned about the study class in the village.

Once, the water pump of the production team broke down, and the lights in the study class went out. The old man immediately took out the only more than a pound of lard in his family and handed it to the study class to use for lighting. When people advised him to take it back, he got angry and said, "Lard can be eaten, but not studying Chairman Mao's works is not possible!"

Soon, the lard was used up, and the water pump was not repaired. The mountain gully was inconvenient for transportation, and it was difficult to buy lard for the time being. This worried the old man. Suddenly, he remembered that more than fifty years ago, his father was driven out of the village by the head of the mountain, and they fled to a cave in the mountains. His father picked wild fruits, made oil, and lit fires to fend off wild beasts. So, the old man put on a backpack, tucked a machete in his waist, climbed cliffs, and ascended peaks, traveling more than thirty li to the cave where he had lived more than fifty years ago. He worked the whole day, picking a full backpack of plump wild fruits. After returning to the village in the dark, he didn't even eat dinner. He immediately made oil with the rice pot and sent it to the study class.

The next evening, the lights in the study class shone brightly again. The old man looked at the brightly lit wild fruit oil lamp with satisfaction and couldn't help but sing the mountain song that the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Li ethnicity love to sing:

Wuzhishan, five clouds,
Each cloud red, floating to Beijing,
The Li people face Chairman Mao,
Generation after generation, hearts unchanging.
Eh, eh, generation after generation, hearts unchanging!

    黎族人民心愈红
    解放军某部黎族战士　黎见东
    无产阶级文化大革命开始不久，我们部队毛泽东思想宣传队就开进海南岛五指山参加“三支”“两军”工作。两年来，我们亲眼看到，经过无产阶级文化大革命，五指山上的黎族人民更加热爱毛主席，更加爱读毛主席的书，人的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。黎族贫下中农忠于毛主席的红心，象五指山上的山茶花，越开越红。
    在五指山南麓的一个叫什边村的寨子里，住着一位六十三岁的老贫农黄德春，人人都称他是“人老心红”的老阿公。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，这里办起了毛泽东思想学习班，老阿公第一个报了名。在学习班里，老阿公是一个最积极的学员。每天早晨，当公鸡还没有打鸣的时候，他就起床来到学习班，点起明亮的山竹火，掏出一条特意从六里地以外买回来的白毛巾，细心地把毛主席像框擦得干干净净，把学习班收拾得利利索索。办完这一切，就向毛主席像深深鞠一躬，然后，借着山竹火光，戴起老花眼镜，翻开那本不知翻过多少遍的《为人民服务》，一字一句认真读起来。直到公鸡叫出第一声，他才爬到山上的毛泽东思想宣传台，咚咚咚地敲响鹿皮鼓，对着寨子高喊：“太阳出山罗！到学习班集合罗！向毛主席表忠罗！”
    在学习班里，他是学习毛主席著作最用功的学员之一。他常对人说：
  “毛主席是咱黎家的大恩人，毛主席的书是咱贫下中农的革命宝书。上山打狼没枪不行，干革命不读毛主席的书不行！”每天早晚和饭前饭后，他都要戴上老花眼镜，学几段《为人民服务》，在那本笔记本上，画满了圈圈和道道。遇到不认识的字，他就请教解放军战士和寨上的年青人，不弄个水落石出决不罢休。每当毛主席最新指示发下来，他就用那小本本子，一笔一划地抄下来，田头做工田头学，早晚做饭灶前学，晚上挑灯学习班里学。现在，老阿公已经能熟练地背诵《为人民服务》和十多条毛主席语录了，他还教老伴背会了七条毛主席语录。寨里的人都称赞他说：“山上的扁柏越长越绿，老阿公人越老心越红，成了咱学习班最积极的老学生啦！”
    大办毛泽东思想学习班，使老阿公懂得了不少革命道理。他经常乐呵呵地说：“我老头活了几十年，如今也能进学堂，真是托毛主席他老人家的福啊！”因此，他对寨里的学习班特别关心。
    有一次，生产队的水轮泵坏了，学习班的电灯不亮了，老阿公就毫不犹豫地拿出家里仅有的一斤多猪油，交给学习班点灯用。人家劝他拿回去，他生气地说：“猪油不吃可以，不学习毛主席著作怎么行！”
    不久，猪油点完了，水轮泵还没修好，山沟里交通不便，一时难以买到猪油。这可急坏了老阿公。忽然，他想起五十多年前，父亲被山甲头人赶出寨子，带着他逃到一个山洞里，父亲就采摘野果子，熬油点火，抵御野兽。于是，老阿公便背上背篓，腰插砍刀，攀悬崖，登高峰，跋涉三十多里，来到这个五十多年前住过的山洞旁。他整整干了一天，满满地采了一背篓肥大的野果子。摸黑回寨后，他饭也顾不上吃，马上用饭锅熬制成油，送到学习班去。
    第二天晚上，学习班的灯光又亮起来了。老阿公满意地看着通亮通亮的野果子油灯，不由得又唱起了黎族贫下中农最爱唱的山歌：
    五指山哟五朵云，朵朵红云飘北京，黎家向着毛主席，世世代代不变心。哎格罗，哎格罗，世世代代不变心！
