As our people, filled with revolutionary fervor and the joy of victory, celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the whole country is ablaze with red, and our socialist motherland presents a scene of unprecedented prosperity and flourishing. Looking at the world, the east wind is blowing strongly across five continents and four seas, and the revolutionary tide is surging, presenting a very good situation.

Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: the general trend of the international situation is that "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The development of the international situation over the past ten years and the current reality of the world have all proven how correct and profound Chairman Mao's famous scientific judgment is.

The world has entered an era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner
Socialist China has become a stronghold of the world revolution

Our era is one with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Today, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more and more widely around the world. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the billions of revolutionary masses, are pushing the world revolution forward with an unparalleled great force. This is the most important sign of the good situation in the current international situation.

The great proletarian cultural revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao personally, has, after a tremendous struggle, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev hiding within the Party, and has achieved decisive victories nationwide. This is a great joy for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Through this great revolution, the dream of imperialism and revisionism to restore capitalism in China has completely shattered. The dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has been further consolidated. Socialist China, this stronghold of the world revolution, has become even stronger. This will have a profound impact on the entire international communist movement.

The Albanian people bravely stand on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism
The forces of Marxism-Leninism in the world are growing stronger

Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have achieved great successes in the revolutionary movement and socialist construction. This year, Comrade Hoxha proposed educational revolution and worker supervision, further promoting the revolutionary movement. The Albanian people bravely stand on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, making new contributions to the international communist movement. Recently, the People's Republic of Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist clique.

The flames of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism have tempered the truly Marxist-Leninist left-wing forces around the world. Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various countries are growing stronger. Even in countries under the brutal rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and its followers, new Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary organizations have emerged, raising the torch against modern revisionism. In the sharp class struggle internationally, a small handful of Marxist-Leninist traitors inevitably have to split from the revolutionary ranks, but the entire international communist movement and the world people's revolutionary struggle are advancing irresistibly towards victory.

The flames of armed struggle by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are blazing
Revolutionary mass movements are flourishing in Europe and North America

In the main regions of the contemporary world revolutionary storm, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, national liberation movements, especially people's armed struggles, have developed significantly. The heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation has achieved great victories, contributing to the anti-American struggle of the world's people. In the vast regions of Southeast Asia, revolutionary armed struggles are blooming everywhere. The Palestinian people and the peoples of other Arab countries, the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, and the peoples of many African countries are persisting in armed struggles. Some Latin American countries have also ignited the flames of people's armed struggles. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Chairman Mao's brilliant revolutionary truths are increasingly penetrating people's hearts, becoming a powerful ideological weapon for oppressed nations and peoples in their struggle for liberation.

The storm of people's revolutionary struggles has not only swept across Asia, Africa, and Latin America but has also spread to the heartland of imperialism, Europe, and North America. This is an important development in the current international situation. This spring, a black people's anti-violence struggle swept through more than a hundred cities in the United States. Subsequently, in France and other Western European countries, broad masses of workers and students launched large-scale revolutionary mass movements. In these struggles, revolutionary masses fought bravely, supported each other, and directed the spearhead of the struggle directly at the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the rotten capitalist system, fully demonstrating the unprecedented awakening of the European and North American peoples.

Great leader Chairman Mao issued another statement this April supporting the black people's anti-violence struggle in the United States. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of the American black people is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited black people but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie." "The struggle of the American black people will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's statement of great historical significance points out the road to liberation for the American black people and all oppressed peoples, greatly encouraging the revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

The political and economic crises of American imperialism are becoming increasingly severe
The Soviet revisionist clique is in a state of internal and external difficulties

The forces of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and people's revolutionary struggles are like the rising sun, showing an invincible vitality. While imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries are like the setting sun, facing numerous difficulties and having a hard time.

The imperialism led by the United States is facing increasingly severe political and economic crises. Under the fierce impact of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, the rule of the international monopolistic bourgeoisie is becoming more and more unstable. Class contradictions within imperialist countries are extremely sharp. Especially for the United States, this number one imperialist, its policies of aggression and war have suffered heavy defeats, making it even more desperate and unable to escape its predicament of internal and external difficulties. Early this year, a financial crisis triggered by the dollar crisis, the most severe and profound in forty years, swept across the entire capitalist world. The economic situation of all major capitalist countries is worse than the other. Facing this situation, each imperialist country, in order to save itself, wants to shift the crisis to others, launching fierce tariff wars and trade wars. Contradictions between imperialist countries are becoming increasingly acute. Various phenomena further confirm the wise judgment of great leader Chairman Mao: "The era we are in is the era of the complete collapse of the imperialist system, and the imperialists have fallen into an irretrievable crisis."

The situation of modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists is also not good. The Soviet revisionist clique has completely restored capitalism domestically, making a mess of things, and the people are in an uproar. It has intensified its global counter-revolutionary collusion with American imperialism abroad, pursuing a policy of social imperialism, not only provoking strong condemnation and opposition from the peoples of various countries but also accelerating the disintegration of the modern revisionist clique. The February Budapest Black Conference was a big exposure. While the Soviet revisionist clique recently brazenly sent hundreds of thousands of troops to invade Czechoslovakia, rampaging and killing civilians, using bayonets to create puppets, it has even more nakedly exposed its ferocious face and weak substance, declaring the total bankruptcy of modern revisionism.

The two major reactionary forces of the United States and the Soviet revisionists are already on their last legs, and the reactionary forces in various countries that depend on them are even more in a state of panic and despair.

In summary, whether it is imperialism, modern revisionism, or reactionary forces in various countries, they are all sitting on a volcano, and their days are numbered.

The new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has arrived
The world's people are intensifying their struggles and will bury the two superpowers

However, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries are not willing to admit defeat and will make desperate counterattacks. The United States and the Soviet revisionists are colluding with each other, attempting to redivide the world. They are intensifying the formation of an anti-China military encirclement, constantly stirring up anti-China waves internationally. They continue to jointly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. It is particularly noteworthy that the Soviet revisionist clique is intensifying its betrayal of the Vietnamese revolution, closely cooperating with the American imperialists' "peace talks" deception, plotting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. All of this does not show the strength of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism but rather their desperate struggles.

The desperate counterattacks of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have played a role in mobilizing the world's people. Today, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has arrived. The peoples of the world are uniting more closely to launch sustained and fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, these two number one enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." The anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the peoples of the world are a great encouragement and support for the Chinese people. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the flames of the great proletarian cultural revolution, resolutely support the struggles of oppressed nations and countries for liberation and independence, resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and resolutely stand with the revolutionary peoples of the world to fight to the end to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionary forces of various countries, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system.

### 世界革命形势一片大好

专栏：国际时事讲话

    世界革命形势一片大好
    当我国人民满怀革命的豪情和胜利的喜悦，迎接中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，全国山河一片红，我们的社会主义祖国呈现出空前繁荣昌盛的景象。放眼世界，五洲四海东风劲吹，革命洪流翻腾激荡，也是一派大好形势。
    十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：国际形势的总的特点是，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。十年来国际形势的发展和当前世界的现实，都证明了毛主席这个著名的科学论断是多么正确，多么深刻。
    世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代
    社会主义的中国成为世界革命的坚强堡垒
    我们的时代是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代。今天，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，正在全世界越来越广泛地传播。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同亿万革命群众相结合，正以无可比拟的巨大力量推动着世界革命的深入发展。这是当前国际形势大好的最重要标志。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，经过惊天动地的伟大斗争，彻底摧毁了隐藏在党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，已经取得全国范围的决定性胜利。这是中国人民和世界革命人民的大喜事。经过这个大革命，帝国主义、修正主义想要在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦完全破灭了。我国的无产阶级专政更加巩固了。社会主义中国这个世界革命的坚强堡垒更加强大了。这对于整个国际共产主义运动必将产生深远的影响。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇地站在反帝反修前线
    世界马克思列宁主义的力量日益发展壮大
    在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命化运动和社会主义建设中，取得了伟大的成就。今年，霍查同志提出了教育革命和工人阶级监督，推动了革命化运动的进一步发展。阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇地站在反帝反修的前线，对国际共产主义运动作出了新的贡献。最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国采取的宣布退出华沙条约的革命行动，是对苏修叛徒集团的一个沉重打击。
    反帝反修的斗争烈火锻炼了全世界真正的马克思列宁主义的左派力量。各国的马克思列宁主义政党和组织正在成长壮大。即使在苏修叛徒集团及其追随者残暴统治下的国家里，也出现了新的马克思列宁主义政党和革命组织，举起了反对现代修正主义的火炬。在尖锐的国际阶级斗争中，一小撮马克思列宁主义的叛徒不可避免地要从革命队伍中分化出去，然而整个国际共产主义运动和世界人民革命斗争却在势不可挡地胜利前进。
    亚非拉人民武装斗争的烈火熊熊
    欧洲北美革命群众运动蓬勃兴起
    在当代世界革命风暴主要地区的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，民族解放运动，特别是人民武装斗争，有了很大的发展。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争取得伟大胜利，为世界人民的反美斗争作出了贡献。在东南亚的广大地区，革命的武装斗争遍地开花。巴勒斯坦人民和其他阿拉伯国家的人民，刚果（金）人民和非洲许多国家的人民，正在坚持武装斗争。拉丁美洲一些国家也点起了人民武装斗争的火焰。“枪杆子里面出政权”。“星星之火，可以燎原”。毛主席的这些光辉的革命真理正在日益深入人心，成为被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的强大思想武器。
    人民革命斗争的风暴不仅席卷亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，而且扩展到了帝国主义心脏地带的欧洲和北美。这是当前国际形势的一个重要发展。今年春天，美国爆发了席卷一百几十个城市的黑人抗暴斗争。接着，在法国和其他西欧国家，广大工人和学生展开了大规模的革命群众运动。在这些斗争中，革命群众英勇战斗，互相支持，把斗争的矛头直接指向垄断资产阶级的统治和腐朽的资本主义制度，充分显示了欧洲和北美人民的空前觉醒。
    伟大领袖毛主席在今年四月又一次发表支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。毛主席指出：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”毛主席的这一具有伟大历史意义的声明，为美国黑人和一切被压迫人民指出了争取解放的道路，大大鼓舞了全世界人民的革命斗争。
    美帝国主义政治经济危机日益深重
    苏修叛徒集团内外交困日子不好过
    马克思列宁主义力量、社会主义力量、人民革命力量，有如旭日东升，显示出无比强大生命力。而帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，却如日薄西山，困难重重，日子极不好过。
    以美国为首的帝国主义，政治、经济危机日益深重。在各国人民革命斗争的猛烈冲击下，国际垄断资产阶级的统治越来越不稳。帝国主义国家内部的阶级矛盾空前尖锐。特别是美国这个头号帝国主义，侵略政策和战争政策遭到惨重失败，更是走投无路，无法摆脱内外交困的狼狈处境。今年年初，一场以美元危机为起因的四十年来最严重、最深刻的金融危机，席卷整个资本主义世界。所有主要资本主义国家的经济情况，一个比一个糟糕。面对着这种情况，各个帝国主义国家为了救自己的命，要把危机转嫁给别人，展开了激烈的关税战和贸易战。帝国主义国家之间的矛盾越来越加剧。种种现象进一步证实了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
    以苏修为首的现代修正主义的景况也同样不妙。苏修叛徒集团在国内全面复辟资本主义，搞得乌七八糟，民怨沸腾。它在国外同美帝国主义加紧全球性的反革命勾结，推行社会帝国主义政策，不仅激起了各国人民的强烈谴责和反对，而且加剧了现代修正主义集团的分崩离析。二月的布达佩斯黑会就是一次大暴露。而苏修叛徒集团最近悍然出动几十万军队侵占捷克斯洛伐克，横冲直闯，枪杀群众，用刺刀制造傀儡，更是赤裸裸地暴露出了它的凶恶面貌和虚弱实质，宣告了现代修正主义的总破产。
    美帝和苏修这两大反动势力已经日暮途穷，依附于它们的各国反动派，更是处在惶惶不可终日的境地。
    总之，帝国主义也好，现代修正主义也好，各国反动派也好，都是坐在火山口上，它们的寿命是屈指可数了。
    反对美帝苏修的历史新时期已经到来
    世界人民加紧斗争必将埋葬两大恶霸
    但是，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，是绝不甘心失败的，它们还要作疯狂的反扑。美帝苏修正在相互勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界。它们加紧拼凑反华军事包围圈，在国际上不断掀起反华的逆浪。它们继续合伙镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争。特别值得注意的是，苏修叛徒集团正在加紧出卖越南革命，紧密配合美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局，阴谋扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火。所有这些，并不表现美帝苏修的强大，而是表现了它们的垂死挣扎。
    美帝苏修的疯狂反扑，起了动员世界人民的作用。今天，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经到来。全世界人民正在更加紧密地团结起来，向美帝苏修这两个头号敌人发动持久的、猛烈的进攻。
    毛主席教导我们说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”全世界人民反帝反修的斗争，是对中国人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命烈火锻炼的七亿中国人民，坚决支持被压迫民族和被压迫国家争取解放和独立的斗争，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争，坚决同全世界革命人民一道，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗到底。
