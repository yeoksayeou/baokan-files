The revolutionary production situation in Shaanxi's textile industry is excellent. The broad masses of revolutionary workers on the textile front in Shaanxi Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary and production situation is better than ever. The production volume of major products in the province's textile industry has increased significantly month by month and quarter by quarter. The production of cotton yarn in the second quarter increased by 18 percent compared to the first quarter, and the production of cotton cloth increased by more than twofold. Since the third quarter, the monthly production level of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has been higher than that of the second quarter.

Shaanxi Province is one of the major bases of China's textile industry. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the textile workers in various factories followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhering to Chairman Mao's instruction to "unite the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to wage a heroic struggle against Khrushchev in China and his agents in their units, seizing power from the capitalist roaders within the Party and establishing revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees in various factories, following Chairman Mao's great teachings that "politics is the commander, the soul," and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," have emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on promoting production through revolution, and guiding production through revolution. They have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "production first," "business in command," and "material incentives" promoted by Khrushchev in China and his agents on the textile front. Revolutionary workers combine the struggle against revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and further establish the idea of spinning and weaving for the revolution.

The broad masses of workers on Shaanxi's textile front, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are now earnestly carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    陕西省纺织工业战线革命生产形势大好
    陕西省纺织工业战线上的广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，革命和生产形势空前大好。全省纺织工业的各项主要产品的产量逐月逐季大幅度上升，第二季度棉纱产量比第一季度增长百分之十八，棉布产量增长二倍多。第三季度以来，棉纱、棉布的月生产水平比第二季度又有提高。
    陕西省是我国纺织工业的主要基地之一。在无产阶级文化大革命中，各厂的纺织工人紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，遵循毛主席的“无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权”的伟大指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本单位的代理人进行了英勇的斗争，夺了党内走资派的权，建立了三结合的革命委员会。各厂革委会遵照毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，突出无产阶级政治，坚持以革命带动生产，以革命统帅生产。他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在纺织工业战线上推行的“生产第一”、“业务挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。革命职工把批修和斗私结合起来，肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒，进一步树立起为革命纺纱织布的思想。
    陕西纺织工业战线上的广大工人群众在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下，正在认真地进行斗、批、改。（据新华社讯）
