The vast plateau of Tibet is filled with jubilation. The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet enthusiastically hail the simultaneous birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan. The first generation of the Tibetan working class and millions of emancipated serfs have been holding various celebratory meetings and parades in recent days, unanimously praising the revolutionary committees and expressing their most sincere wishes for the long life of the great leader Mao Zedong!

The newly born Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held a serious study and discussion session on the evening of the 6th, listening repeatedly to the editorial published in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, which enthusiastically hailed the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan. That night, the entire city of Lhasa was filled with festive scenes. Today, Lhasa held a grand celebration with 50,000 people and a parade. The chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and the commander of the Tibet Military Region, Comrade Zeng Yongya, spoke at the meeting, calling on the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, to unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, to further strengthen the unity between the army and the people, to swiftly launch a campaign of struggle, criticism, and transformation, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to build this southwestern frontier of the motherland, which opposes the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the Indian reactionaries, into an iron wall.

The first generation of the Tibetan working class, with the most enthusiastic political spirit, enthusiastically hails the redness of the motherland. The workers of Lhasa today held high red flags and carried the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, participating in the meeting with high spirits. They excitedly said, "The achievement of a red country is the result of the working class and the people of the whole country following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and engaging in a heroic struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev and their agents. Today, the great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great battle command to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our factories and units, to lead the entire Tibet in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

When celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the redness of the country, the millions of emancipated serfs in Tibet, with tears in their eyes, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" over and over again. A 40-year-old emancipated serf, Jide, said, "The slave-owning class exploited and oppressed us for decades. Chairman Mao saved us. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet attempted to restore the feudal serf system and capitalism in Tibet, which is a heinous crime. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, and turn Tibet into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." When celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the redness of the country, the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet said, "We must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, cherish and defend the newly born revolutionary committees as we cherish our eyes, consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen the unity between the army and the people and among ethnic groups, smash all attempts by the class enemies to shake and sabotage the revolutionary committees, and build the revolutionary committees into leadership bodies that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the southwestern border of the motherland enthusiastically hail the simultaneous birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan. The heroic soldiers firmly declare that they must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, forever fight side by side with the millions of emancipated serfs and the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, and contribute everything to the great historical task of completing the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and building the southwestern border of the motherland into a great iron wall.

In recent days, the red flags have been flying on the roof of the world, and the vast plateau has been filled with victory songs. The troops stationed in Tibet have been in high spirits. From the headquarters to the platoons, from the "three supports, two militaries" front lines to the snow-capped outposts, many units have held grand celebratory meetings and parades with the residents of the border cities. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians face Beijing and their hearts turn to the red sun, shouting repeatedly with joy: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

On this joyous day, the soldiers fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the people of all ethnic groups in various places, held celebratory meetings and discussions, discussing the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the excellent situation of the country being red. The soldiers excitedly said, "All our achievements are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mount Everest is high, but not as high as Chairman Mao's genius; the Yarlung Zangbo River is deep, but not as deep as Chairman Mao's wisdom. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionaries and the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unite in thought, step, and action, respect, trust, support, help, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and build the Tibetan plateau into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought."

The good news reached the "Highland Red Border Guard" and the "Model of Love for the People" Pu Buzai's former unit stationed on the ice-covered Himalayas. The soldiers immediately held celebratory meetings and discussions. Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power," deeply realizing that the establishment of the revolutionary committees is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles, and determined to make new contributions to the people in the great struggle to consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees. To defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the national border, the soldiers who had won honors in the battle against the armed provocations of the Indian reactionaries, as well as the broad masses of soldiers who guard the border day and night with heightened vigilance, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "We must not relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory." They are determined to heighten their revolutionary vigilance, further strengthen the unity between the army and the people, strengthen military preparedness, and be ready to "exert all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy" at any time, to defend and build the socialist motherland, and to make greater contributions to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

		September 5, more than 50,000 soldiers and civilians in Lhasa, Tibet, surrounded by the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing praises to the great leader Chairman Mao, held a grand meeting and parade to celebrate the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Revolutionary Committee of Lhasa City.
