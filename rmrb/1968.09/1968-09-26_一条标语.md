In the East China Institute of Chemical Technology, there is a water tower about twenty-five meters high, which is the tallest building on campus. On the morning of September 2, several members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers and about a dozen Red Guards were busily working around the water tower. They were thoroughly eradicating a slogan with strong bourgeois factionalism at the top of the water tower that read, "×× will definitely win, ×× will definitely lose."

Among the busy crowd, there was a sturdy young Red Guard who, under the direction of a worker comrade from the propaganda team, exerted all his strength to hoist a bucket of several dozen pounds of lime to the top of the tower with a rope as thick as a bowl. Then, he eagerly began to whitewash. Who was he? He was the maker of the bourgeois factionalist slogan.

The story goes like this. Last year, instigated by a handful of class enemies, the East China Institute of Chemical Technology had experienced a bout of armed conflict. Because bourgeois factionalism had shielded the enemy, this young Red Guard did not direct his hatred towards the enemy but instead vented his anger on his fellow classmates. He thought, "I must paint some 'permanent' slogans that are hard to erase on campus to provoke the other side and vent my anger." Thus, he and two other Red Guards climbed the water tower, disregarding the danger to their lives, and suspended themselves in mid-air with ropes tied around their bodies, painting the eight large characters "×× will definitely win, ×× will definitely lose."

In March of this year, when the Revolutionary Committee of the institute was established, someone asked him to remove the large characters from the water tower, but he refused, saying, "I don't want to erase them. If anyone wants to erase them, let them do it themselves!"

After the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers entered the school, they vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions and helped everyone establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This young Red Guard also participated in the study. The worker comrades noticed that his thoughts were stirred, and they patiently told him, "Workers and peasants work hard to support you, but you are fighting 'internal wars' and creating bourgeois factionalism in school. How can you face the laboring people and our great leader Chairman Mao?" The worker comrades' education made him realize that the large characters he had painted were wrong and that he had done something foolish that hurt his friends and pleased his enemies, obstructing the great alliance of revolution and deviating from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The worker comrades hoped that he would remove the large characters from the water tower and, with practical actions, overcome bourgeois factionalism. However, he did not have the courage to do so at that moment. He said, "I dare not go up." The worker comrades pointed out, "In the past, you did things with bourgeois factionalism and had such courage. Now, why don't you have the courage to do things according to proletarian party spirit?" These words raised his consciousness further. He thought: Knowing it was wrong but not daring to erase it meant his determination to correct the mistake was not strong. Not correcting a mistake, how could one be a genuine proletarian revolutionary? The next morning, with the help of worker comrades and other students, he climbed the high tower and erased the eight large characters he had written a year ago, one by one. He expressed that he would not only erase slogans with strong bourgeois factionalism but also erase the influence of bourgeois factionalism in his thoughts.

In the past, there were many big-character posters and slogans attacking each other in the campus of the East China Institute of Chemical Technology, on the walls and water towers. Now, all the students in the school are actively and voluntarily erasing these big-character posters and slogans that fought "internal wars" and replacing them with determination letters and big-character posters to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The entire school is filled with a hot and lively revolutionary scene.

    一条标语
    在华东化工学院，有一座约二十五米高的水塔，这是全院最高的建筑物。九月二日上午，工人毛泽东思想宣传队的几个队员和十几个红卫兵小将在水塔上下、周围，十分紧张地忙碌着。原来，他们正在彻底铲除水塔顶端的一条“××必胜，××必败”的资产阶级派性十足的标语。
    在紧张工作的人群中，有一个身材结实的小将，在工人宣传队老师傅的指挥下，使尽浑身的力气，用一根碗口粗的麻绳，将一桶几十斤重的石灰吊上了塔顶。然后，他又争着粉刷起来。他是谁呢？他就是这条资产阶级派性标语的制作者。
    事情经过是这样的。去年，在一小撮阶级敌人的挑动下，华东化工学院曾经发生过一次武斗。因为资产阶级派性掩护了敌人，这位小将没有将仇恨集中在敌人身上，而是将气一古脑儿出在对方阶级弟兄身上。他想，一定要在校内刷一些难以除去的“永久性”标语，刺刺对方，出出气。这样，他便同另外两个小将爬上了水塔，顾不得生命危险，用绳子缚住身体，悬吊在半空中，一笔一笔地刷出了那“××必胜，××必败”的八个大字。
    今年三月，院革委会成立时，有人要他将水塔上的大字涂去，他拒绝说：“我不高兴涂，谁要涂自己去！”
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，大力宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，帮助大家办毛泽东思想学习班，这个小将也参加了学习。工人同志看到他思想有触动，又耐心地对他说：“工人农民辛勤劳动养活了你们，而你们却在学校里打‘内战’，闹资产阶级派性，这怎么对得起劳动人民，对得起我们伟大领袖毛主席呢！”工人同志的教育，使他认识到过去刷的大标语错了，干了使亲者痛、仇者快的蠢事，阻碍了革命的大联合，背离了毛主席的伟大战略部署。工人同志希望他把水塔上的大字涂去，以实际行动克服资产阶级派性。可是，他一时拿不出一年前刷这些大字时的胆量。他说：“我不敢上去。”工人同志又指出：“过去你带着资产阶级派性干事，有那样大的胆量，现在按照无产阶级党性办事，怎么没有这样的胆量了？”这些话，使他的思想又提高了一步。他想：明知不对，而又没有勇气去刷掉，就是改正错误的决心还不大。有错不改，这算得了什么无产阶级革命派呢？第二天一早，他在工人同志的帮助下，和其他同学一起，爬上了高塔，把一年前写的八个大字一个个地刷掉。他表示，不但要刷掉资产阶级派性十足的标语，而且要刷掉思想上的资产阶级派性的影响。
    过去在化工学院校园内，墙壁上，水塔上，有很多互相攻击的大字报、大标语。如今，全校同学积极、主动地把这些打“内战”的大字报、大标语都洗刷掉了，换上了落实毛主席最新指示的决心书和大批判文章，全校到处是热气腾腾的革命景象。
