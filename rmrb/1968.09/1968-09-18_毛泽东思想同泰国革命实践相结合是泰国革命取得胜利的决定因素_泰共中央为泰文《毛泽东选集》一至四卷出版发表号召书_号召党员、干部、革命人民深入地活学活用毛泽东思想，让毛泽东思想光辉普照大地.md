The combination of Mao Zedong Thought with Thai revolutionary practice is the decisive factor for victory in the Thai revolution. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand issued a call for the publication of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volumes 1 to 4, urging party members, cadres, and revolutionary people to deeply study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, allowing the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate the land.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand issued a call on September 10th for the publication of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volumes 1 to 4. The call urges members of the Communist Party of Thailand, cadres, armed fighters, and all revolutionary people to more broadly and deeply study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, combining Mao Zedong Thought with Thai revolutionary practice, and allowing the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate the land of Thailand.

	The full text of the call is as follows:

	Mao Zedong Thought is the decisive factor for victory in the Thai revolution.

	At the moment when the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, are hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieving continuous victories in the armed struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and the overthrow of the Thanom-Praphat clique, China has published and distributed the complete four volumes of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The publication and distribution of the complete four volumes of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is of great significance in the life of our party, making the long-awaited people of our country very happy, as they will be able to study more conveniently, deeply, and broadly. The publication of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the lofty internationalist aid from the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to our Thai people's revolution, especially at the moment when our people are engaged in fierce armed struggle.

	Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new level. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the revolutionary people of the whole world, will become an inexhaustible material force, capable of destroying the old world and creating a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without a system of exploitation.

	Today, whether or not one acknowledges Chairman Mao as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, whether or not one acknowledges that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of development of Marxism-Leninism in our time and the guiding light for the world's revolutionary people, is the dividing line between genuine and false Marxist-Leninists.

	Therefore, in the party's proclamation on the 24th anniversary of its founding in December 1966, our party called on all party members and armed fighters to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, to transform their worldview and improve their work methods. In last year's proclamation on the 25th anniversary of its founding, our party again called on party members and armed fighters to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to resolutely carry the armed struggle to the end.

	After our party called on all party members, cadres, and armed fighters to launch a movement to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, party members, cadres, and armed fighters, and indeed all revolutionary people, responded enthusiastically to this call, making the atmosphere of studying and applying the brilliant works of Chairman Mao more lively and widespread. In particular, there was a widespread study of the "Three Articles": "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," insisting on transforming one's worldview, emphasizing "eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit," and cultivating a communist worldview. This has made our comrades class-conscious and imbued with a spirit of revolutionary struggle, fearless of difficulties and death. In addition, there was a persistent effort to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all revolutionary practices, making our revolutionary work effectively advance.

	Our party members, armed fighters, and revolutionary people have limitless respect for Chairman Mao and limitless faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Now our armed revolutionary struggle has spread to 30 provinces. The reason why the armed struggles in the Northeast, South, Central, and North have been able to achieve continuous victories, repeatedly smashing the "sweeps" and suppression of the U.S.-Thanom clique, is because our party has raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, among party members and armed fighters as well as among the revolutionary masses throughout the country, has broadly studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought. Practice has proven that to effectively study Mao Zedong Thought, one must first deeply understand that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, must have a proletarian standpoint and deep class feelings, and must grasp the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, study and apply together, learn first what is urgently needed, see results immediately, and work hard on the 'apply' part."

	Now, the complete four volumes of the Thai-language edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been published. Therefore, we once again call on all party members, all cadres, and armed fighters, as well as all revolutionary people, to more broadly and deeply launch a movement to study and apply the works of Mao Zedong, thoroughly transform one's worldview, work from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely solve various problems. Focus on studying Chairman Mao's works on military affairs, allowing the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate the land of Thailand.

	Combining Mao Zedong Thought with Thai revolutionary practice is the decisive factor for victory in the Thai revolution. As long as we follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and advance along the revolutionary path he has indicated—relying on the peasants, establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing national power—our Thai people will be able to defeat the aggressors of American imperialism and their running dogs, liberate the nation and the people, and achieve true national independence and people's democracy. Let us advance bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to seize even greater new victories.

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

	Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand

	September 10, 1968

    毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合是泰国革命取得胜利的决定因素
    泰共中央为泰文《毛泽东选集》一至四卷出版发表号召书
    号召党员、干部、革命人民深入地活学活用毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想光辉普照大地
    新华社十七日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，泰国共产党中央委员会九月十日为泰文《毛泽东选集》第一卷至第四卷出版发表号召书，号召泰共党员、干部、人民武装战士以及所有革命人民更加广泛深入地活学活用毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合，让伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉普照泰国大地。
    号召书全文如下：
    毛泽东思想是泰国革命胜利的决定因素
    正当泰国共产党领导下的人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在抗击美帝国主义侵略者和推翻其走狗他侬—巴博集团的武装斗争中不断取得胜利的时刻，中国出版并发行了泰文《毛泽东选集》全部四卷。泰文《毛泽东选集》全部四卷的出版发行，在我党生活中具有重大意义，使等候已久的我国人民都非常高兴，因为将能更方便、深入和广泛地学习。出版泰文《毛泽东选集》是中国共产党和中国人民对我们泰国人民革命的崇高的国际主义援助，特别是正当我国人民在进行激烈的武装斗争时刻。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想为全世界革命人民所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的物质力量，就能够消灭旧世界，创建起一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。
    当今，承认不承认毛泽东主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，承认不承认毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义发展到最高水平、是世界人民革命的指路明灯，这是真假马克思列宁主义者的分界线。
    因此，我党在一九六六年十二月建党二十四周年的文告中，号召全体党员和人民武装所有战士认真地学习毛泽东思想，改造自己的世界观和改进工作方法。在去年十二月建党二十五周年的文告中，我党又再次号召党员和人民武装战士更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地把武装斗争进行到底。
    在我党号召全体党员、干部和人民武装战士掀起认真学习毛泽东思想运动后，党员、干部和人民武装战士，甚至所有革命的人民都切实地响应这个号召，使活学活用毛泽东主席的光辉著作的气氛更活跃和普遍，特别是普遍地学习“老三篇”《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，坚持改造自己的世界观，强调“破私立公”树立共产主义的世界观，使我们的同志有阶级觉悟，有翻天覆地的战斗精神，不怕困难和不怕死。此外，还坚持用毛泽东思想指导各项革命实践，使我们的革命工作有效地向前迈进。
    我党党员、人民武装战士和革命的人民无限敬仰毛泽东主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。现在我们的革命武装斗争已经蔓延到三十个府了。东北部、南部、中部和北部的武装斗争之所以能够接连取得胜利，一次又一次地粉碎美国—他侬集团的“扫荡”镇压，就是因为我党高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，并在党员和人民武装战士中以及在全国的革命人民群众中，广泛地活学活用毛泽东思想。实践证明，要有效地学习毛泽东思想，首先，必须深刻地认识毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，必须有无产阶级立场和深厚的阶级感情，必须掌握林彪副主席的指示：“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”
    现在，泰文《毛泽东选集》全部四卷已经出版了。因此，我们再次号召全体党员、全体干部和人民武装战士以及所有革命人民更广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东著作的运动，彻底改造自己的世界观，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法去工作和切实地解决各种问题，专心学习毛泽东主席关于军事的著作，让伟大的毛泽东思想光辉普照泰国大地。
    把毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合，是泰国革命胜利的决定因素。只要我们遵循毛泽东主席的指示，沿着他老人家所指引的革命道路——依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权的道路前进，我们泰国人民就能够战胜美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗，解放国家和人民，取得真正的民族独立和人民民主。让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下奋勇前进，去夺取更加伟大的新胜利。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    泰国共产党中央委员会
    一九六八年九月十日
