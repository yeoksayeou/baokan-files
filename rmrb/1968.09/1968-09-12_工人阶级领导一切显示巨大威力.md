The workers at the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have fully demonstrated the leadership role of the working class. They have made both revolution and production thrive. Since last year, the station has exceeded the national electricity generation plan every month, setting a new record for electricity generation since its establishment. The mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has also flourished and achieved significant results. This year, the station has achieved new successes in safe electricity generation and supply.

The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station is the first large-scale hydropower station in China designed and installed by Chinese engineers. The working class demonstrated great creativity and wisdom in its construction, earning immortal merits. However, after the station was completed, Khrushchev and his agents vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management and scientific research lines, placing a group of counter-revolutionaries, bourgeois elements, and reactionary technical "authorities" in key positions. They also vigorously promoted "expert management," "technology first," "bonus incentives," and other revisionist goods. They also formulated a set of revisionist enterprise management systems, suppressing the workers' enthusiasm and creativity. For a long time, many technological innovation topics and rationalization suggestions proposed by workers were deemed not to fit the "foreign, large, new, and comprehensive" framework by those reactionary "authorities" and were thus suppressed.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers at the hydropower station seized the enterprise management power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary technical "authorities." They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They took the workshop, construction site, and dam as their battlegrounds, carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. They fiercely criticized and exposed the revisionist goods such as "expert management," "technology first," "bonus incentives," and the "crawling philosophy" promoted by Khrushchev and his agents. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers was greatly inspired. They carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply developing technological innovation and technological revolution. Everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, carried out innovations, and did everything possible to contribute to generating and supplying more electricity. Currently, thirty-six major technological innovation and technological revolution projects have achieved remarkable results. Before the Cultural Revolution, some workers had proposed a major technological revolution suggestion, but it was suppressed by the reactionary technical "authorities" under the pretext of "safety regulations." Last year, after the revolutionary workers took control of the technological power, they immediately conducted bold experiments, successfully implementing this major technological revolution project. This not only significantly improved the voltage level of the transmission lines but also saved the country the basic construction costs of over 200 million yuan needed for generating an additional 50,000 kilowatts.

Now, from the factory, workshop, to the team, from the operation, management, and maintenance of mechanized and automated equipment to basic construction, workers and revolutionary technical personnel work together to manage technology collectively. Every major innovation is carried out by mobilizing the collective wisdom of the workers. The workers, who were once slandered by those reactionary technical "authorities" as "rough and uneducated," with their profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide and command production. They manage the modernized and automated large hydropower station very well, continuously creating new production records. Last year, they completed the annual national electricity generation plan four months ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan. In the first eight months of this year, they not only completed the national electricity generation plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan every month but also achieved new successes in safe electricity generation and supply that have never been seen since the station's establishment. Technological innovation has also reached new heights. Revolutionary workers deeply feel: With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the working class will definitely be able to lead everything!

    工人阶级领导一切显示巨大威力
    新安江水力发电站充分发挥工人阶级领导作用，革命生产热气腾腾，去年以来，月月超额完成国家发电量计划，技术革新攀上了新的高峰
    新华社杭州十一日电　新安江水力发电站的革命工人，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，把革命和生产搞得热气腾腾。去年以来，这个发电站月月超额完成国家发电量计划，而且创造了建站以来发电量的最高纪录。技术革新和技术革命的群众运动也蓬勃开展，并取得了重大成果。今年以来，安全发电供电又取得了新的成就。
    新安江水电站是我国第一座自己设计、自己安装的大型水力发电站，工人阶级在建设中发挥了巨大的创造力和智慧，立下了不朽的功勋。但是电站建成以后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人极力推行反革命修正主义的企业管理路线和科研路线，把一批反革命分子、资产阶级分子和反动技术“权威”，安插在重要岗位上，并且大肆宣扬“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货。他们还制订了一套修正主义的企业管理制度，压制工人的积极性和创造性。长期以来，工人提出的大量革新课题和合理化建议，都被那些反动“权威”认为不符合“洋、大、新、全”的框框，一个个被扼杀了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，水电站的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，从党内一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”手里夺回了企业管理大权，并且遵循毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，以班组为单位，把车间、工地、大坝作战场，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“奖金挂帅”、“爬行哲学”等修正主义黑货。通过革命的大批判，广大革命职工革命精神大振，他们发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，深入开展技术革新和技术革命，人人献计献策，提建议，搞革新，千方百计为多发电多供电贡献自己的力量。目前已有三十六项较重大的技术革新和技术革命项目取得了显著成果。在文化大革命以前，有些工人就提出过一项重大的技术革命的建议，但是当时被反动技术“权威”以“安全法规”等为借口扼杀了。去年，革命工人掌握了技术大权后，立即进行大胆试验，终于使这项重大技术革命项目得到成功，不仅大大提高了输电线路的电压水平，而且为国家节省了增发五万多瓩所需的基本建设费用两百多万元。
    现在，从厂、车间到班组，从机械化、自动化设备到基本建设的操纵、管理、维修，都实行工人和革命的技术人员相结合，集体进行技术管理。每项重大革新，都发挥工人的集体智慧，群策群力进行。过去被那些反动技术“权威”污蔑为“大老粗”的工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅生产、指挥生产，把现代化自动化的大型水电站管理得很好，生产不断创造出新纪录。去年提前四个月超额完成了全年国家发电量计划，今年头八个月不仅月月提前和超额完成国家发电计划，而且安全发电供电又出现了建站以来没有过的新成绩。技术革新也攀登了新的高峰。革命工人深有体会地说：我们工人阶级有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就一定能领导一切！
