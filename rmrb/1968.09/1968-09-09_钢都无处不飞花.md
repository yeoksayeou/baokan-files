A single night of spring breeze sweeps across ten thousand miles, and the steel city blooms everywhere. On the night of September 6, radio waves pierced the long sky, crossing countless rivers and mountains, bringing the joyous news of the simultaneous birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the realization of a red tide across the entire nation, to our country's steel production base—Anshan. Instantly, drums and gongs resounded, and people danced in celebration. The million-strong people of the steel city, with hearts aflame, shouted in unison: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! From all fronts, joyous teams gathered in front of the Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, exulting in the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sincerely wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

Among the continuous streams of joyous teams, the most eye-catching was the propaganda team composed of outstanding steel workers, advocating Mao Zedong Thought. The working class of the steel city listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. They resolutely carry out the battle command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the working masses." They formed the first batch of propaganda teams advocating Mao Zedong Thought, with over two thousand participants, marching into primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, and together with revolutionary teachers and students, launching a fierce battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Upon hearing the great news of the nation turning red, they held up the precious book, gazed towards Beijing, and with surging emotions, said: Chairman Mao has immense trust in the working class, and we will definitely make Chairman Mao proud. With Chairman Mao leading us and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, even if the old bourgeois educational system is extremely stubborn, we will definitely smash it to pieces! The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must be planted throughout the entire educational front!

From the high furnaces where molten iron flows to the open-hearth furnaces where sparks fly, from the iron mines where cannons roar to the rolling mills where machines hum, workers heard the great news of the nation turning red, and their revolutionary spirit soared, and their production enthusiasm surged. Iron smelting workers said: The height of the furnace cannot surpass our revolutionary will, and the redness of iron cannot compare to our hearts being redder for Chairman Mao. We will definitely carry out every instruction from Chairman Mao; we will definitely follow every great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. Revolutionary veteran worker Zhang Yulin of the No. 9 furnace excitedly said: Celebrating the nation turning red, we are overjoyed, but the enemy hates it in their hearts. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and turn Anshan into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The workers of Anshan implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production." Inspired by the continuous victories of the Cultural Revolution, they have created one new record after another in steel smelting. The great news of the nation turning red further became a tremendous motivating force for them to create new achievements. All revolutionary workers of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the First Steel Plant, upon hearing the news, stoked the furnace fire even higher, and at the fastest speed, smelted a batch of high-quality steel, creating a new production record. They firmly declared: With Chairman Mao leading the way, we grasp the revolution, and the revolution is resounding; we engage in production, and production is booming. We will definitely shoulder the double burdens of revolution and production and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    钢都无处不飞花
    一夜春风吹万里，钢都无处不飞花。
    九月六日夜里，电波划破长空，飞过万水千山，把西藏自治区革命委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会同时诞生，全国山河实现一片红的巨大喜讯，传到了我国钢铁生产基地——鞍山。刹时，锣鼓喧天，人群欢舞。钢都百万军民颗颗红心向着红太阳，齐声欢呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！从各条战线上出动的报喜的队伍，云集在鞍山市革命委员会门前，纵情欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，衷心祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    在接连不断的报喜队伍里，最引人注目的是由优秀钢铁工人组成的毛泽东思想宣传队。钢都的工人阶级最听毛主席的话。他们坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的战斗号令，组成了有两千多人参加的第一批工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进大、中、小学校，同革命师生一道，打响了斗、批、改的激烈战斗。当他们听到全国实现一片红的特大喜讯后，手捧宝书，眼望北京，心潮滚滚，无限激动地说：毛主席无比信任工人阶级，我们坚决为毛主席争气。我们有毛主席领导，有毛泽东思想作武器，旧的资产阶级教育制度再顽固，我们也一定能够把它砸个稀巴烂！毛泽东思想的伟大红旗一定要插遍整个教育阵地！
    从铁水奔流的高炉上到钢花飞舞的平炉前，从炮声隆隆的铁矿山到机器轰鸣的轧钢机旁，工人们听到全国山河一片红的特大喜讯，革命斗志倍增，生产干劲更足。炼铁工人们说：炉高赛不过我们革命意志高，铁红比不上我们忠于毛主席的心更红。毛主席的每一个指示，我们坚决照办；毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们步步紧跟。九号高炉革命老工人张玉林激动地说：欢庆全国山河一片红，我们喜在眉梢，敌人恨在心头。我们要牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，认真搞好斗、批、改，把鞍钢办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    鞍钢工人贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在文化大革命取得一个又一个胜利的喜讯鼓舞下，一次又一次地创造了炼钢新纪录。全国山河一片红的大喜讯传来，更成了他们创造新成就的巨大鼓舞力量。第一炼钢厂二号平炉全体革命职工听到喜讯后，把炉火烧得更旺，以最快的速度炼出了一炉优质钢，创造了生产新纪录。他们坚定地表示：有毛主席领路，我们抓革命，革命轰轰烈烈，搞生产，生产热气腾腾。我们坚决挑起革命和生产两副重担，为无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新贡献！（新华社）
