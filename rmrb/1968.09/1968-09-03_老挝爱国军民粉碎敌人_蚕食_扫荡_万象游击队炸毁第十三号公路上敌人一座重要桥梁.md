Lao patriotic military and civilians recently foiled the enemy's multiple "gnawing" and "sweeping" attacks, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

On August 15, the Mang Hong Sa guerrilla forces in Sayaboury Province bravely counterattacked the enemy, killing 54 enemy soldiers and forcing the remaining enemy to flee in disarray. The guerrillas also seized a batch of weapons and military supplies.

On August 17, local forces and guerrillas in Savannakhet Province bravely counterattacked the enemy's "gnawing" offensive, annihilating 30 enemy soldiers in a location 4 kilometers north of Mang Phalan. They also seized a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

On August 18, patriotic neutral forces and guerrillas in Khammouane Province foiled the right-wing Lao military's "gnawing" offensive in the liberated area of Naxia, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

Local forces and people in Khammouane Province killed 16 enemy soldiers, including a company commander, and seized a batch of weapons and supplies in two days, July 4 and August 9.

Guerrillas and people in Xieng Khouang Province struck against bandits and special agents conducting looting and sabotage activities in the Mang Sang area on August 4 and 15, killing and injuring a number of enemies, and seizing a batch of weapons and supplies.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang on August 2, the Lao Patriotic Front reported that on August 2, the Vientiane guerrillas blew up the Nam Jin Bridge on the 13th Highway. The guerrillas killed one enemy guard and captured one enemy soldier. The remaining enemy guards, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled in panic. The guerrillas also destroyed two enemy vehicles.

The Nam Jin Bridge is located approximately 30 kilometers from Vang Vieng and is an important bridge on the 13th strategic highway.

Local forces in Udomsay Province, on August 16, counterattacked the bandits, who were nurtured by the Americans, in the area 8 kilometers east of Tongxoy, killing 10 bandits and seizing 15 various weapons.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang, the Patriotic Front radio station broadcasted an editorial on August 21, calling on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to unite closely and thoroughly foil the new military adventures of American imperialism and its lackeys.

The editorial pointed out that the enemy's frantic military adventures do not indicate their strength; on the contrary, this only shows their weakness. The more they struggle desperately, the more they will suffer heavier defeats until they are completely annihilated.

The editorial said that at present, the Lao patriotic military and civilians are fighting stronger and winning more victories; the enemy is fighting weaker and suffering more defeats. The people of Savannakhet Province, who have a tradition of brave struggle, are determined to foil the enemy's new military adventures.

The editorial finally called on the patriotic military of the Lao liberated areas and the people of Savannakhet Province to unite closely, extensively launch a people's war, annihilate more enemy forces, shoot down more enemy planes, and use their blood and lives to defend the liberated areas, thoroughly foiling the enemy's new military adventures.
