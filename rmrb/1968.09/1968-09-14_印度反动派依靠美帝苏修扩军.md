The Pakistan Times recently exposed that the Indian reactionary government is relying on the help of U.S. imperialists and other Western countries, as well as Soviet revisionists, to vigorously expand its navy and air force.

According to a report by this newspaper on September 6, citing news from New Delhi, India will expand its air force by an additional five squadrons. It is said that this decision was made at the annual air force command meeting, which was presided over by Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh after three days of discussion and concluded on September 4 in New Delhi.

During the meeting, the director of the armaments department of the Western Command of the Indian Army requested an increase in the supply of Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles to be installed at many newly constructed air bases in Punjab. Another important decision made at the meeting was to accept the previous U.S. proposal to supply India with complex communication equipment (including radar and electronic computing equipment) worth $100 million.

The Pakistan Times reported on September 4 that Admiral S. M. Nanda, the Indian Navy Chief of Staff, who is currently traveling in Europe, is carrying a long list of purchases to quickly expand the Indian Navy.

The main purpose of his 21-day European trip is to obtain at least two large warships, reportedly to acquire a new missile cruiser to replace the aging "Mysore" cruiser; and to obtain an aircraft carrier to supplement the "Vikrant" aircraft carrier.

    印度反动派依靠美帝苏修扩军
    《巴基斯坦时报》最近揭露，印度反动政府正在依靠美帝等西方国家和苏修的帮助，竭力扩充海军和空军。
    据这家报纸六日引用来自新德里的消息说，印度将把它的空军再扩充五个中队。据说这个决定是在空军指挥官年度会议上作出的，会议在空军上将阿尔詹·辛格主持下经过三天讨论后，于九月四日在新德里结束。
    印度西部军区军械部长在会议上要求增拨苏修的地对空导弹，以便安装于最近在旁遮普各地建成的许多空军基地上。会议作出的另一个重要决定是，接受以前美国提出的供给印度价值一亿美元的复杂的通讯设备（包括雷达和电子计算设备）的建议。
    《巴基斯坦时报》四日报道，正在欧洲旅行的印度海军参谋长查特吉海军上将随身携带一份很长的采购单，为的是迅速扩建印度海军。
    他的二十一天的欧洲之行的主要目的是至少取得两艘大型军舰，据说是要得到一艘新型导弹巡洋舰，以代替正在变得陈旧的“迈索尔号”巡洋舰；还要取得一艘直升飞机母舰，以补助航空母舰“维克拉姆号”。
