	Created Dust Removal Equipment Together with Workers
	Tianjin Asbestos Products Factory Technician Sūn Cǎiwén

	When I heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the radio, memories of the past kept flooding back to me. In 1960, after graduating from Hebei Textile Institute, I was assigned to the Asbestos Factory. Over the past eight years, I have deeply felt that only by accepting the transformation of the working class and uniting with the masses of workers and peasants can one contribute to socialism.

	Take the improvement of the dust removal equipment in the raw cotton workshop, for example! To solve this problem, a university graduate had come here twice to use this issue for his graduation design, but both times he failed to solve it. Our factory's bourgeois technical "authority" had also spent over 3,000 yuan, locked himself in a small room for half a year, and developed a set of foreign equipment, which was also completely unusable. In the latter half of 1964, the factory leadership handed over this "old difficult problem" to me. To be honest, I was a bit intimidated. However, whenever I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes," and whenever I thought of my class brothers still being threatened by asbestos dust, and that every year many old workers would get the occupational disease "asbestosis," a strong proletarian sentiment made me accept the task without hesitation.

	After accepting the task, I did not immediately bring my initial design plan to the workshop. Instead, I first went to the workshop and rolled with the old workers for about a month, familiarizing myself with the workshop's working environment, listening to the old workers' years of practical experience. The masters gave me great inspiration. Although they could not speak the terms of design, every simple sentence sometimes gave me very important inspiration in design improvement.

	After the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, under the leadership and strong support of the factory revolutionary committee, I brought the design plan improved through practice to the workshop to study with the workers together, forming an improvement team including sheet metal workers, brick and wood workers, masters of this workshop, and me. After the plan was determined, we started working, studying Chairman Mao's works while working and improving. By the first half of this year, we had successively completed the "wind selection vibrating screen," "carding machine," and other dust removal equipment, completely changing the working environment of the raw cotton workshop. The original workshop, with each cubic meter containing about 200 milligrams of asbestos dust, has been reduced to about 10 milligrams. Workers are no longer threatened by asbestos dust. At the same time, due to the improvement of the equipment, a great deal of manpower has been saved. What used to require ten people can now be done by four. Chairman Mao's latest teachings have given me boundless strength. I am determined to follow the path guided by Chairman Mao and forever accept the re-education of the working class.

    同工人一起创造了除尘设备
    天津石棉制品厂技术员　孙采文
    当我从广播里听到毛主席的最新指示时，往事一次又一次地在我脑海里浮现。一九六○年，我从河北纺织工业学院毕业后，被分配到石棉厂。八年来的经历，使我深深感到只有接受工人阶级的改造，同工农群众相结合，才能为社会主义贡献力量。
    就拿原棉车间粉尘设备的改进来说吧！为解决这个问题，一个大学毕业生曾经两次来到这里，以这个问题为“题”搞毕业设计，但两次都没能解决。我厂资产阶级技术“权威”也曾花费了三千多元，在一间小屋里整整憋了半年时间搞了一套洋设备，也根本不适用。一九六四年下半年，厂领导把这个“老大难”问题交给了我。说实在的，我真有些胆怯。但是一想起毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄”，一想到自己的阶级弟兄还在受着石棉粉尘的威胁，每年都要有很多老工人得职业病——“石棉肺”的时候，强烈的无产阶级感情就使我义不容辞地接受下来。
    接受任务后，我没有把自己的初步设计方案马上拿到车间来，而是先到车间和老工人一起滚了个把月，熟悉了车间的工作环境，倾听了老工人们多年实践的体会，老师傅们给了我很大的启发。他们虽然不会说设计的名词，但是，每一句简单的语言，有时在设计改进上会给我很重要的启发。
    厂革命委员会成立后，在厂革委会的领导与大力支持下，我把经过实践改进后的设计方案，拿到车间同工人共同研究，组成了一个包括白铁工、瓦木工、本车间的师傅和我在内的改进小组。方案确定后，就动手干起来，边学习毛主席著作，边干边改进，到今年上半年，就先后完成了：“风选震动筛”、“弹花车”等除尘设备，彻底改变了原棉车间的工作环境。原来车间每立方米含二百毫克左右的石棉粉尘下降到了十毫克左右，职工们再也不受那石棉粉尘的威胁了。同时，由于设备改进，大大节省了人力，过去十个人的工作，现在四个人就够了。毛主席的最新教导，给了我无穷力量。我决心沿着毛主席指引的道路，永远接受工人阶级的再教育。
