    Dare to Change the Heavens and Earth
    (Drum and Gong Song)
    Leader: The red flags dance in the south of Tianshan,
    Chorus: The drums resound on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
    Leader: Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians cheer together,
    Chorus: Celebrating the redness of the entire nation.
    Leader: Let us shout with all our hearts:
    Chorus: Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!
    Leader: From the storm of the "January Revolution,"
    Chorus: To the glorious establishment of the Revolutionary Committees in Tibet and Xinjiang,
    Leader: The nation's soldiers and civilians closely follow Chairman Mao,
    Chorus: To achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
    Chorus: Mao Zedong Thought shines over the entire nation,
    Every mountain and river is red.
    The plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism is foiled,
    The dream of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to achieve "peaceful evolution" in China is shattered.
    Leader: Let us cheer loudly,
    Chorus: Cheering the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
    Leader: Let us sing joyfully,
    Chorus: Singing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao!
    Leader: The red flags dance in the east wind,
    Chorus: The victory songs echo through the long sky,
    Leader: Millions of workers and peasants leap forward,
    Chorus: Advancing victoriously without stopping.
    Leader: (Spoken) Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us:
    Chorus: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, transfer office staff, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and reform will generally go through these stages."
    Chorus: The latest instructions shine with golden light,
    It is the steering wheel of the revolution.
    Leader: We, the working class, listen to Chairman Mao's words,
    Chorus: We follow every word and sentence!
    Chorus: Seven hundred million people smile with joy,
    Striding forward with heads held high,
    Seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform,
    Dare to change the heavens and earth!
