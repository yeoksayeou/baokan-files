The Sato reactionary government has indulged Japanese right-wing fascist groups in provoking our cargo ship, sparking strong indignation among our sailors and Japanese friends from all walks of life. The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and other organizations have issued statements condemning the Sato government's policy of hostility towards China.

New China News Agency, September 18th: Tokyo reports that several thugs from the Japanese right-wing fascist group "Great Japan Patriotic Party" have, under the protection and indulgence of the Sato reactionary government, provoked the Chinese cargo ship "Xinan" docked at the waterfront in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, on the afternoon of the 15th. This has sparked strong indignation among Chinese sailors and Japanese friends from all walks of life.

These thugs, under the protection of Japanese police cars, drove a car equipped with two loudspeakers to the side of the "Xinan" ship, shouting wildly and slandering the great People's Republic of China. They also broadcasted extremely reactionary militaristic songs.

When the right-wing thugs were provoking, the responsible person on board the Chinese cargo ship "Xinan" immediately strongly demanded that the Japanese "Immigration Bureau" officials on the ship take immediate measures to stop the provocation by these right-wing thugs. They also sternly pointed out that the Japanese government authorities must take full responsibility for all consequences arising from the provocation by Japanese fascist thugs.

However, Japanese officials used various excuses to shield the right-wing fascist thugs, allowing them to continue their anti-China provocations. This once again exposed the reactionary nature of the Sato government in Japan, which is hostile to China and seeks to undermine the friendly cause between the peoples of China and Japan.

To counter the thugs' despicable actions, the crew of our "Xinan" ship hung a large banner on the ship's side, condemning the Japanese government authorities for indulging right-wing thugs in provoking us.

Japanese friends from all walks of life who uphold the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship are deeply concerned about this incident. Many friends, upon hearing the news, rushed from Osaka to the scene that day to express their concern for our sailors and to negotiate with the Japanese authorities alongside our personnel, demanding that the Japanese authorities guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan External Trade Organization issued separate protest statements on the 17th, condemning the Sato reactionary government's policy of hostility towards China, demanding that the Sato government apologize to the Chinese side, punish the relevant personnel, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

    日中友协（正统）总部等发表声明谴责佐藤政府敌视中国的政策
    新华社十八日讯　东京消息：日本右翼法西斯团体“大日本爱国党”的数名暴徒，在佐藤反动政府的包庇和纵容下，十五日下午向停泊在日本冈山县水岛码头的中国货轮
  “新安”号进行挑衅活动，激起了中国船员和日本各界朋友的强烈愤慨。
    这些暴徒在日本警察当局的警车保护下，疯狂地把一辆带着两个广播喇叭的汽车开到“新安”轮旁，大肆叫嚣，诬蔑和中伤伟大的中华人民共和国。他们还播送反动透顶的军国主义歌曲。
    在右翼暴徒进行挑衅时，我国货轮“新安”号的负责人立即向在船上的日本“出入国管理局”的官员强烈地表示：要求日本政府当局立即采取措施，排除这一小撮右翼暴徒的挑衅活动，并且严正指出：日本政府当局必须对由日本法西斯暴徒的挑衅活动而引起的一切后果，承担全部责任。
    但是，日本官员以种种借口百般包庇右翼法西斯暴徒，以至纵容暴徒进行反华挑衅活动。这就再一次暴露了日本佐藤政府敌视中国、破坏中日两国人民友好事业的反动面目。
    为了反击暴徒的卑劣行径，我国“新安”轮船员，在船舷上挂出了谴责日本政府当局纵容右翼暴徒对我进行挑衅的大幅标语。
    坚持日中友好事业的日本各界朋友对这次事件极为关切。许多朋友闻讯后，当天从大阪赶至现场，对我船员表示关怀，并同我方人员一起向日本当局进行交涉，严正要求日本当局保证不再发生类似事件。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部和日本国际贸易促进协会十七日分别发表抗议声明，谴责佐藤反动政府敌视中国的政策，要求佐藤政府向中国方面赔礼道歉，处分有关人员并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
