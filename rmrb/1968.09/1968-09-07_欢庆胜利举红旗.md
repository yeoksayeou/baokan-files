The red flag is flying high across the motherland,
The cheers echo through the heavens,
Celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees in Tibet and Xinjiang,
Long live Chairman Mao!
The working class is the leading class,
With loyalty in our hearts and red flags in our hands,
We follow Chairman Mao every step of the way,
Achieving a brilliant victory that shocks the world!

Celebrating victory,
The drums beat urgently,
The working class must lead in all things,
We must make Chairman Mao proud!

"The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for the long term,"
We immediately occupy the educational front,
Thoroughly uproot the poisonous roots of revisionism,
And carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

"Seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation,"
We take the lead, blazing new trails,
Fiercely criticize and expose the class enemy,
Revolution and production create miracles.

Celebrating victory, the drums beat urgently,
We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao,
And will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

  欢庆胜利举红旗
  天津铁路车辆段工人业余毛泽东思想宣传队
  祖国处处展红旗，
  欢呼声惊天动地，
  庆祝西藏、新疆革命委员会成立，
  高呼万岁毛主席！
  工人阶级是领导阶级，
  怀忠心，举红旗，
  紧跟毛主席，寸步不离，
  夺得了震惊世界的光辉胜利！
  欢呼胜利，
  战鼓声声急，
  工人阶级必须领导一切，
  我们一定要为毛主席争气！
  “工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去”，
  我们就立即占领教育阵地，
  彻底铲除修正主义毒
  根，
  把无产阶级教育革命进行
  到底！ “认真搞好斗、批、改”，
  我们一马当先，开创新天地，
  狠批深挖阶级敌人，
  革命、生产创奇迹。
  欢呼胜利，战鼓声声急，
  我们永远忠于毛主席，
  夺取无产阶级文化大革命
  的全面胜利！
