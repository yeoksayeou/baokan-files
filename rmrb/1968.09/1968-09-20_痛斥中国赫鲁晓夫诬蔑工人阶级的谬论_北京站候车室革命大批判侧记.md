The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly boosted the morale of the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, completely shattering the counter-revolutionary falsehoods of the Chinese Khrushchev who slanders the working class. In recent days, the service staff of Beijing Station, along with the soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison on duty at the station, and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who came to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, have organized the broad masses of travelers from all over the country in the waiting room to carry out revolutionary criticism. Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, they have severely criticized the representatives of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes—the Chinese Khrushchev.

Mao Zedong Quotations
The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution.

Chinese Khrushchev's lies: The working class, at certain times, may also be unreliable, ... don't assume that relying on the working class is problem-free. We workers are the mainstay of the socialist revolution and construction.

The criticism meeting for passengers waiting to board the 59th train to Changchun began. A soldier on duty, with the revolutionary enthusiasm characteristic of a soldier, gave a brief and powerful opening speech: "Comrades of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, the great leader Chairman Mao trusts the working class the most, while the Chinese Khrushchev hates the working class the most. Let us raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and open fire on the Chinese Khrushchev! Fire!"

As soon as the words were spoken, a worker from Hanzhong, Shaanxi, was the first to speak. He angrily said: "Who dares to say that the working class is unreliable? I started working as an apprentice at the age of twelve or thirteen, always washing clothes, cooking, and toiling for the capitalists. After liberation, it was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who saved me. We workers understand the bitterness of exploitation the most, hate the exploiting class the most, understand the sweetness of socialism the most, and are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. This is the fundamental condition of our reliability. The Chinese Khrushchev dares to slander us, and we will never agree to it!"

An old worker from a coal mine in Datong, Shanxi, said excitedly: "We have a 'mass grave' in Shanxi, where our class brothers were killed by the Kuomintang and capitalists in the past. The old society drove workers into the 'mass grave' as ghosts of injustice. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we fought and gained liberation. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and carry the revolutionary burden to the end."

Upon hearing the words from their class brothers, countless workers who had traveled far and wide were filled with class hatred and blood-stained grievances. One by one, they denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense. There were workers from the North China Power Company, workers from the Ding County Gear Factory, and workers from the First Automobile Works in Changchun. Hatred was like a spark, igniting the anger of hundreds of passengers. Slogans rose and fell, echoing through the room. Everyone said indignantly: "The Chinese Khrushchev's claim that the working class is unreliable is completely a malicious lie. The working class has the highest revolutionary consciousness, listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, and can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments the most. Chairman Mao supports us, and we will definitely make Chairman Mao proud. We workers are the mainstay of the socialist revolution and construction!"

Mao Zedong Quotations
The most intelligent and most capable are those who have the most practical experience.

Chinese Khrushchev's lies: Capitalists know more than we do, they know more than workers. ... The management ability of capitalists exceeds that of our Communist Party members, exceeds that of our comrades. There are many clever and capable people who understand technology.

The lowly are the most intelligent, the noble are the most stupid.

The 13th train is headed to Shanghai. Shanghai, once a "paradise for adventurers," is now an important industrial base of the socialist motherland. The revolutionary masses traveling to and from Shanghai are very familiar with the cruelty and stupidity of the capitalists, as well as the bravery and intelligence of the workers.

A worker from the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory said angrily: "Chairman Mao trusts us workers the most. He always says, 'The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals who labor.' This fellow, the Chinese Khrushchev, actually says that capitalists have more 'knowledge' and 'understand technology.' He is a great traitor and sworn enemy of the working class. Look, from south to north, from north to south, how many factories are there in our country? But which factory's machines and products were created by capitalists? None, none, not a single one! All the machines and products are created by us workers. Chinese Khrushchev, open your dog eyes and see, who is really capable, the capitalists or the workers?"

A railway worker raised his fist excitedly and said: "Who has the most knowledge? Who understands technology the most? You don't need to look at anything else, just look at the train we are about to board. Who built the locomotive? Workers! Who built the railway? Workers! Who drives the train? Still us workers!"

At the mention of the Chinese Khrushchev's malicious slander against the working class, workers from all over the country would not agree.

Look, workers from the Jinzhou Railway Bureau Parts Factory, while waiting for the train to the Northeast, said: "I only studied for two years and started working at the age of fifteen. I have been in the factory for more than twenty years. In the past, our factory was under the control of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and the management and technical rights were not allowed to be held by workers. We workers wanted to make a cutting-edge product, but the professors and experts would just shake their heads and say it was impossible. Since the Cultural Revolution, we workers have been in charge of production, technology, and the power of the factory. As a result, a product that engineers couldn't make in three years, we workers, who don't understand 'projection' and don't draw blueprints, managed to make it in just one month. This fully proves that workers are more capable than anyone else, right?"

Look, young construction workers from Shijiazhuang, while waiting for the train to the south, said: "Comrades, this magnificent and grand Beijing Station that we are staying in was built by workers in just ten months. The iron-clad facts are here, the working class is the most intelligent, most capable, most able to endure hardship and labor, and most able to build socialism."

Everyone criticized in unison: "The Chinese Khrushchev praises capitalists as 'clever and capable.' What are capitalists clever at? They are clever at exploitation. What can capitalists do? They can only exploit. The Chinese Khrushchev praises capitalists to the sky and presses the working class down to the ground, completely with ulterior motives. He wants to collude with capitalists, ghosts, and monsters to usurp the socialist state and restore capitalism. We must fight against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, and must thoroughly criticize and expose the representatives of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the Chinese Khrushchev, and never allow these fallen dogs to crawl back to shore and bite people again."

Mao Zedong Quotations
Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution.

Chinese Khrushchev's lies: Workers do not understand politics, have low consciousness, and are not obedient. Workers do not guard labor discipline, do not work hard, want to eat well, want to dress well, and want more money.

With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious.

The 63rd train is headed to Baotou, and the 33rd train is headed to Chengdu. Passengers boarding these two trains to the northwest and southwest of the motherland usually gather in the large waiting room on the second floor of Beijing Station in the afternoon. The golden sunlight of the capital shines through the spacious and bright large glass windows, making the fiery revolutionary criticism in the waiting room even more intense.

"Chinese Khrushchev dares to slander workers as lazy and gluttonous, which is simply outrageous!" Several workers traveling from the Northeast to Sichuan stood up and slammed the table, indignant: "The Chinese Khrushchev's mind, which only thinks of promotion and wealth, how can he understand the revolutionary spirit of the working class? The working class knows best how to sacrifice for the construction of socialism. Now we are traveling thousands of miles to the southwest, isn't it for the sake of a public cause rather than a private one?"

The passengers were filled with righteous indignation, one after another, eager to speak:

"The Chinese Khrushchev slanders workers as lazy and gluttonous, which is simply putting the capitalist hat on the workers' heads. Only the exploiting class is lazy and gluttonous, living on human blood!"

"The Chinese Khrushchev says workers welcome exploitation and that capitalists support workers, which is simply turning white into black. Since there have been class distinctions, where have workers and peasants not supported landlords, rich farmers, and capitalists?"

Workers from the Baotou Industrial Foundry Engineering Company and the Second Railway Engineering Bureau, who were about to return to the highlands of the northwest, participated in the criticism with full hatred. They said: "The Chinese Khrushchev says workers do not understand politics and have low consciousness, and even says that capitalists are 'reliable politically in ninety percent.' This is simply enough to burst our lungs with anger. We workers, from production practice and class struggle practice, have the highest proletarian consciousness and understand proletarian politics the best. Capitalists only know how to exploit, make money, and oppress workers. What 'politically reliable' are they? They are reliable in counter-revolutionary politics! They are reliable in restoring capitalism!"

Passengers from all directions raised their fists and roared:

"The Chinese Khrushchev says the working class is not obedient. Yes, the working class is not obedient to the capitalists' words, and is not obedient to the Chinese Khrushchev's words. The working class is obedient to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao tells us to go where, we go where; Chairman Mao tells us to do what, we do what."

"In 1921, the workers of Anshan started a revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao; during the Cultural Revolution, the workers of Shanghai launched the 'January Revolution' storm; now it is the workers from all over the country who follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployments the most closely. This is the iron-clad fact that the working class understands proletarian politics the best and can lead the revolution. Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true: 'The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious.'"

In unison, they shouted: "Whoever opposes the leadership of the working class, we will overthrow them!"

The revolutionary criticism in the waiting room was in full swing:

Poor and lower-middle peasants spoke. Peasants from the Sanli Town Commune of Jin County, Liaoning Province, and peasants from Guangxi on the front line of supporting Vietnam against America spoke in unison: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.' We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow the workers' elder brothers and forever make revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army spoke. Soldiers from a certain unit waiting to transfer to Heilongjiang, while propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev through fast-talking, performances, and other art forms, said proudly: "The working class must lead everything. We soldiers of the People's Liberation Army vow to be the strong backing of the working class. Whoever opposes the leadership of the working class, we will overthrow them!"

Red Guards spoke. Several university students all spoke sincerely and excitedly: "The working class has the most thorough revolutionary spirit. We must honestly accept the re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resolutely combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers on the road of revolutionization and laborization."

The service staff of Beijing Station also joined the battle with the passengers. The service staff all criticized with their personal experiences: "The Chinese Khrushchev and his representatives in the railway system have always hated and slandered the working class, deceiving us to serve 'well-dressed' and 'elegant' bourgeois passengers for many years. We must rebel against them and resolutely serve the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers."

The soldiers of the Beijing Garrison on duty at the station and the soldiers of the 4513th Unit who came to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions were all actively doing mobilization work among the passengers and said passionately: "We will always be of one mind with the working class and resolutely defend the leading position of the working class. The Chinese Khrushchev dares to touch the working class, and our guns will not agree."

"Learn from the working class!" "Salute the working class!" "Overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev!" "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be fully victorious!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The thunderous slogans echoed through the grand hall of the Beijing Station waiting room. This is the power of the revolutionary criticism by the workers, peasants, and soldiers from all over the country. This power will also be carried by the whistling steam and rolling wheels from the capital to the vast land of the motherland.

    痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人阶级的谬论
    ——北京站候车室革命大批判侧记
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”毛主席的最新指示，大长了工人阶级和广大工农兵群众的志气，大灭了资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的威风，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人阶级的反革命谬论。连日来，北京车站的服务员，和北京卫戍区在站上值勤的指战员、以及来站宣传毛泽东思想的解放军战士们一起，把来自五湖四海的广大旅客组织起来，在候车室里开展革命大批判，用毛主席最新指示为武器，狠狠批判了资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的代理人——中国赫鲁晓夫。
    毛主席语录
    工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：工人阶级在一定的时候，也可能是不能依靠的，……不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的。咱工人就是要做社会主义革命和建设的顶梁柱
    等候乘五十九次列车到长春方向去的旅客批判会开始了。一个值勤战士带着战士特有的革命豪情，讲了简短有力的开场话：“无产阶级革命派的战友们，伟大领袖毛主席最信任工人阶级，中国赫鲁晓夫最仇视工人阶级，让我们高举毛泽东思想的千钧棒，向中国赫鲁晓夫开炮！开炮！”
    话音刚落，一个从陕西汉中来的工人首先发言，他愤怒地说：“谁胆敢胡说我们工人阶级不可靠？我十二、三岁就当徒工，一直给资本家洗衣、做饭、当牛作马。解放了，是毛主席、共产党救了我。我们工人阶级最懂剥削的苦，最恨剥削阶级，最懂社会主义的甜，最忠于毛主席。这就是可靠的根本条件。中国赫鲁晓夫胆敢诬蔑我们，我们一万个不答应！”
    一个从山西大同来的煤矿老工人激动地说：“我们山西有个‘万人坑’，就是当年国民党、资本家杀害我们阶级兄弟的地方。旧社会把工人逼迫成‘万人坑’里的冤鬼，伟大领袖毛主席领导我们进行斗争得到了解放。我们一定听毛主席的话，把革命的担子挑到底。”
    一听阶级兄弟的心里话，多少走南闯北的工人同志都引起了阶级恨，血泪仇，一个个痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的混账黑话。这里有华北电力公司的工人，有定县齿轮工厂的工人，有长春第一汽车制造厂的工人。仇恨好比火种，它把几百旅客的怒火都点着了。口号声此伏彼起，响成一片。大家气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫胡说工人阶级不能依靠，完全是别有用心的鬼话。工人阶级最有革命觉悟，最听毛主席的话，最能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定给毛主席争气，咱工人就是要做社会主义革命和建设的顶梁柱！”
    毛主席语录
    最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：资本家知识比我们多，比工人知道得多。
    资本家……的管理能力超过我们的共产党员，超过我们的同志。精明干练的人，懂得技术的人不少。
    卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢                                    
    十三次列车是开往上海的。上海，昔日是“冒险家的乐园”，今天是社会主义祖国的重要工业基地。来往于上海的广大革命群众对于资本家的残忍、愚蠢，对于工人的勇敢、聪明是十分熟悉的。
    上海重型机械厂的工人气愤地说：“毛主席最相信我们工人阶级，他老人家总是说“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。”中国赫鲁晓夫这个家伙居然胡说资本家比工人‘知识多’，‘懂技术’，真是工人阶级的大叛徒、死对头。大家看，从南到北，从北到南，我们国家的工厂何止千万？但是有哪一个工厂的机器、产品是资本家创造出来的？没有，没有，就是没有！所有的机器、产品都是咱们工人创造的。中国赫鲁晓夫，睁开你的狗眼看看吧，到底是资本家能干，还是工人能干？”
    铁路工人抡起拳头激动地说：“到底谁最有知识？谁最懂技术？不用看别的，单看眼下大伙就要乘坐的火车就明白了。火车头谁造的？工人！铁路谁修的？工人！火车谁开的？还是咱们工人！”
    一提起中国赫鲁晓夫对工人阶级的恶毒诬蔑，五湖四海的工人都不答应。
    看，锦州铁路局配件厂的工人在等候去东北的列车时说：“我只读了两年书，十五岁就当工人，在工厂干了二十多年了。过去我们厂在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的控制下，管理权、技术权都不让工人掌握。咱工人要搞个尖端产品，教授专家就是摇头说不行。文化大革命以来，咱工人就是管生产、管技术、掌握工厂的大权。结果，工程师三年搞不出来的产品，咱工人一不懂‘投影’，二不画图纸，硬是一个月就搞出来了。这不十足说明工人比谁都能干吗？”
    看，石家庄的青年建筑工人，在等候开往祖国南方的列车时说：“同志们，咱们现在呆在这里的这个雄伟壮丽的北京车站，就是工人在短短十个月内建成的。铁的事实摆在这里，工人阶级就是最聪明、最能干，最能吃大苦、耐大劳，最能建设社会主义。”
    大家纷纷批判说：“中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧资本家‘精明干练’，资本家精在哪里？就精在剥削；资本家能干什么？就能干剥削。中国赫鲁晓夫把资本家捧上天，把工人阶级压下地，完全有不可告人的目的。他就是要伙同资本家、牛鬼蛇神篡夺社会主义江山，搞资本主义复辟。我们一定要同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级斗争到底，一定要把资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的代理人中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，决不许他们这伙落水狗爬上岸来重新咬人。”
    毛主席语录
    只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：工人不懂得政治，觉悟不高，工人不听话。
    听说很多工厂，……不守劳动纪律，不好好工作，又要吃好的，又要穿好的，钱要得多。
    有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了
    六十三次列车开往包头，三十三次列车开往成都。分乘这两趟车驰向祖国西北和西南的旅客，总是在下午时分一齐聚集在北京站二楼西侧的大候车室里。首都的金色的阳光从宽敞明亮的大玻璃窗里照进来，照得候车室里火热的革命大批判更加火热。
      “中国赫鲁晓夫竟敢诬蔑工人好吃懒做，真是岂有此理！”几个由东北去四川的工人拍案而起，，怒不可遏：“中国赫鲁晓夫他那个只想升官发财的资本家心眼，哪能识得工人阶级的革命胸怀？工人阶级最懂得为建设社会主义而牺牲自己。眼下我们万里迢迢去西南，不就是舍了一个私字，为了一个公字吗？”
    旅客们义愤填膺，一个接一个地抢着发言：
      “中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人好吃懒做，简直是把资本家的帽子强安到工人头上来了。只有剥削阶级才好吃懒做，喝着人血过日子！”
    “中国赫鲁晓夫胡说工人欢迎剥削，资本家养活工人，真是把白的说成黑的了。自从有阶级区分，哪里不是工人农民养活地主老财资本家？”
    即将返回西北高原的包头工业铸炉工程公司的工人，铁路工程二局的工人，都怀着满腔仇恨参加了大批判。他们说：“中国赫鲁晓夫胡说工人不懂政治，觉悟不高，反而说什么资本家‘百分之九十几政治上可靠’，真是把人的肺都气炸了。我们工人从生产实践中，从阶级斗争的实践中，最有无产阶级觉悟，最懂无产阶级政治。资本家就懂得剥削、赚钱、压迫工人。他们是什么‘政治上可靠’？他们就是在反革命的政治上可靠！他们就在复辟资本主义上可靠！”
    四面八方的旅客挥动着铁拳头怒吼了：
    “中国赫鲁晓夫说工人阶级不听话。对，工人阶级就是不听资本家的话，就是不听中国赫鲁晓夫的话。工人阶级就是听毛主席的话，毛主席叫咱往哪咱往哪，毛主席叫咱干啥咱干啥。”
    “一九二一年，安源的工人就在毛主席领导下发动革命；文化大革命中，上海的工人掀起了‘一月革命’风暴；现在又是全国各地的工人最紧跟毛主席的战略部署。这就是工人阶级最懂无产阶级政治，最能领导革命的铁的事实。毛主席的话千真万确：‘整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。’”
    齐声唤：谁反对工人阶级领导，就打倒谁！
    候车室的革命大批判如火如荼：
    贫下中农发言了。来自辽宁省金县三十里铺公社的贫农社员，来自援越抗美前线的广西的贫农社员，异口同声地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们的国家是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。’我们贫下中农一定跟工人老大哥一起，在毛主席领导下永远闹革命。”
    解放军战士发言了。等待转车去黑龙江的某部战士，一面用快板、演奏等文艺形式宣传毛主席最新指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫，一面豪迈地说：“工人阶级必须领导一切。我们解放军战士誓做工人阶级的坚强后盾，谁反对工人阶级领导，就打倒谁！”
    红卫兵小将发言了。好几个大学生，都诚恳而激动地说：“工人阶级最有革命的彻底性。我们一定老老实实接受工农兵给我们的再教育，坚决与工农兵结合，在革命化、劳动化的道路上快步前进。”
    北京站的服务员也和旅客们一起投入了战斗。服务员们都用亲身体会批判说：“中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统的代理人，仇视工人阶级，诬蔑工人阶级，多少年来一直诱骗我们为‘穿戴整齐’，‘举止文雅’的资产阶级旅客服务。我们就是要造他们的反，坚决为工人阶级服务，坚决为广大工农兵群众服务。”
    在站值勤的北京卫戍区的战士和来站宣传毛主席最新指示的四五一三部队的战士，都一面积极在旅客中做鼓动工作，一面激昂地说：“我们永远同工人阶级一个心眼，坚决捍卫工人阶级的领导地位。中国赫鲁晓夫胆敢碰一碰工人阶级，我们的枪杆子决不答应。”
    “向工人阶级学习！”“向工人阶级致敬！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”轰雷般的口号声响彻北京站候车室的大厅。这是五湖四海工农兵群众革命大批判的威力。这威力，也将随着阵阵汽笛，滚滚车轮，从首都传往祖国辽阔的大地。　本报记者
