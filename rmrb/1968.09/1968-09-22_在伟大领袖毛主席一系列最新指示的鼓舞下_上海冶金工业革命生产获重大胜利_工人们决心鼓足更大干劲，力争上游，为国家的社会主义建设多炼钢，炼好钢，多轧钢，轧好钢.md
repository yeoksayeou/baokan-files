Inspired by the series of latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, Shanghai's metallurgical industry has achieved a major victory in its production revolution. The workers are determined to redouble their efforts, strive to be at the forefront, and contribute more and better steel, and more and better rolled steel to the country's socialist construction.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 21st, a new production upsurge has begun to form and rapidly develop on the metallurgical front in Shanghai under the inspiration of the series of latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao.

	The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The steel workers of Shanghai, who grew up during the Great Leap Forward, with their profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the revolution firmly, and promote production vigorously, achieving great victories on both the revolutionary and production fronts.

	Since this year, the production of steel and steel products in Shanghai has been higher in the second quarter than in the first, and in July and August, revolutionary workers, with a high fighting spirit, overcame the high temperatures and achieved high production; since September, production has continued to rise steadily. Various factories have successively successfully trial-produced a batch of important new varieties. The quality of many products has leaped into the ranks of the world's advanced level. Many factories, including Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 8, and Shanghai Special-shaped Steel Pipe Plant, have presented a scene of vibrant activity.

	The publication of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is the most powerful political driving force for the emergence of a new production upsurge in Shanghai's steel industry. In recent periods, many steel plants, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Implementing the proletarian educational revolution must have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses," have selected a large number of outstanding workers to join the workers' propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in colleges and universities. Although many factories have reduced their production personnel, the workers who remain in the factory have displayed a sky-high revolutionary spirit, and production has continued to increase. After dispatching a large number of personnel, the steel output of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 in August was 30% higher than in the same period in 1966, and several workshops created new historical records.

	The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on Shanghai's steel front, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching of "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective," firmly grasp the class struggle, the struggle between the two lines, and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, driving and promoting the development of steel industry production. They always regard carrying out the great criticism of the revolution as a powerful driving force for promoting production. Many revolutionary workers in steel plants use the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have been exposed as negative examples, combining the actual situation of their own factories and workshops, holding large and small meetings, and conducting fierce criticism in workshops and teams, greatly arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary workers. Workers say: Production leaps forward, neither relying on equipment nor on raw materials, we rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The three-roll mill on the first workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 is famous throughout the plant as the "tiger's mouth," where not only the labor intensity is high, but it is also a bottleneck for production development. Previously, the plant's capitalist-roaders posted "recruitment notices" several times, offering rewards to whoever solved this technical difficulty. Some bourgeois reactionary "authorities" competed for fame and wealth, and the whole plant had seven groups working on it at the same time, but they kept secrets from each other and did not communicate. Workers pointed out sharply: "Recruitment notices, recruitment notices, are the capitalist-roaders' wealth notice, are our workers' grievance notice." The reactionary "authorities" fiddled around for more than ten years but did not come up with anything. During the Cultural Revolution, workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "arousing a great fearless spirit of creation," proposed to conquer the "tiger's mouth" in nineteen days. They worked day and night, fearing no fatigue, fighting continuously, making full use of old materials and old equipment, spending only a small amount of processing fees, and in fourteen days, they successfully developed the automatic steel feeding that the reactionary "authorities" had failed to achieve in more than ten years, wasting a large amount of funds.

	In the development of steel production, Shanghai steel workers have broken through many unreasonable rules and regulations, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The workers and revolutionary technical personnel of the casting workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 cooperated with each other, broke many unreasonable rules and regulations, daringly innovated the electric furnace smelting process, reducing the smelting time per furnace from about four hours to about two hours, opening up a new path for producing steel more, better, faster, and cheaper.

	Shanghai steel workers are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. They are determined to advance further, redouble their efforts, strive to be at the forefront, and produce more and better steel, and more and better rolled steel for the country's socialist construction, welcoming the new upsurge in national industrial production under the great situation of the country turning red.

### 在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下  上海冶金工业革命生产获重大胜利  工人们决心鼓足更大干劲，力争上游，为国家的社会主义建设多炼钢，炼好钢，多轧钢，轧好钢

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下
    上海冶金工业革命生产获重大胜利
    工人们决心鼓足更大干劲，力争上游，为国家的社会主义建设多炼钢，炼好钢，多轧钢，轧好钢
    据新华社上海二十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，一个新的生产高潮已开始在上海冶金工业战线形成并迅猛地向前发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”在大跃进年代中成长起来的上海钢铁工业工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在革命和生产两条战线上都取得了重大胜利。
    今年以来，上海钢和钢材的产量，二季度比一季度高，七、八月份，革命职工们以高昂的战斗姿态，战胜了高温，夺得了高产；九月份以来，产量继续稳步上升。各厂都陆续试制成功一批重要的新品种。许多产品的质量跃入世界先进水平的行列。上钢一厂、上钢二厂、上钢三厂、上钢八厂和上海异型钢管厂等许多工厂，都出现了一派热气腾腾的景象。
    毛主席一系列最新指示的发表，是上海钢铁工业出现新的生产高潮的最强大的政治动力。最近一段时期，许多钢铁厂遵循毛主席“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的教导，选派大批优秀工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队，到大专院校领导斗、批、改。许多厂尽管生产人员减少了，留厂的工人发扬冲天的革命干劲，产量持续上升。上钢二厂在抽调大批人员后，八月份钢材产量比一九六六年同期增长百分之三十，有几个车间的产量都创造了历史新纪录。
    上海钢铁战线的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，牢记毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，坚持以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，带动和促进钢铁工业生产的发展。他们始终把开展革命大批判作为推动生产的强大动力。许多钢厂革命职工把已经揪出来的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派等阶级敌人作为反面教员，结合本厂、本车间的实际，开大会小会，在车间班组，狠狠进行批判，极大地激发起革命职工昂扬的革命斗志。工人们说：生产跃上去，一不靠设备，二不靠原料，我们靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。上钢二厂第一车间轧钢机上的三道车，是全厂有名的“老虎口”，这里不仅劳动强度高，也是发展生产的拦路虎。以前，厂内的走资派几次贴出“招‘贤’榜”，谁解决了这项技术难关，就发给奖金多少。一些资产阶级反动“权威”争名夺利，全厂同时有七个摊摊在搞，但是却互相保密，互不通气。工人们一针见血地指出：“招‘贤’榜，招‘贤’榜，是反动‘权威’的发财榜，是我们工人的受气榜。”反动“权威”折腾了十多年，也没有搞出个名堂来。文化大革命中，工人们遵照毛主席“振奋大无畏的创造精神”的教导，提出十九天攻下“老虎口”。他们不分昼夜，不怕疲劳，连续战斗，充分利用旧材料、旧设备，只花了少量的加工费，用了十四天工夫，就把反动“权威”搞了十多年、浪费了大量资金没有搞成的自动进钢搞成功了。
    上海钢铁工人在发展钢铁生产中，还冲破了许多不合理的规章制度，使群众的积极性、创造性得到了更充分的发挥。上钢三厂铸钢车间的工人和革命的技术人员相互配合，大破不合理的规章制度，大胆革新电炉冶炼工艺，使每炉钢的冶炼时间从四个小时左右缩短到两个小时左右，为多快好省地炼钢，开创了新的途径。
    上海钢铁工人并不满足于已有的成绩，他们决心在全国山河一片红的大好形势下，乘胜前进，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为国家的社会主义建设多炼钢，炼好钢，多轧钢，轧好钢，迎接全国工业生产的新高潮。
