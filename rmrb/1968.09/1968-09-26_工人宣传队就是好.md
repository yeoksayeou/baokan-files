The red flag dances in the wind, and new songs fill the mining academy. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Jiaozuo Mining Academy, under the leadership of the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the entire school presents a vibrant revolutionary scene. The footprints of the worker propaganda team members cover every classroom and dormitory; the deeds of the worker propaganda team members are enthusiastically praised by the revolutionary teachers and students.

	“You Are My Good Example”

	The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team member and miner from the Wangfeng Mine, Liu Guiying, is nearly fifty years old. The revolutionary teachers and students respectfully call her "Aunt Liu." When Liu Guiying heard the news that she was to join the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, she was so moved that she shed tears of joy and couldn't sleep all night. Someone asked her, "You are old, and you are illiterate. Can you manage the university?" She kept Chairman Mao's latest instructions close to her heart and firmly replied, "I can! With Chairman Mao backing me, I can manage anything! Under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, Chairman Mao gave me the courage to stand up to the black winds and fight against the evil waves, crushing the counterattacks of the class enemy. Now, Chairman Mao has tasked the working class to lead the educational revolution, and with a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, I will certainly do a good job of managing the university!"

	After entering the mining academy, Liu Guiying studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the most enthusiasm and was the most affectionate towards the revolutionary teachers and students. Everyone was willing to confide in her. One day, a female student from the Geology Department asked her, "Aunt Liu, I heard that the worker propaganda team is here to seize power from the mining academy revolutionary committee, is that true?" Liu Guiying replied earnestly, "You should think about that! We workers fully support the revolutionary committee. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, we must have the leadership of the working class, we must have the participation of the worker masses, and together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, we must form a revolutionary tripartite alliance with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end.' If you say we are here to seize power, that's right. We are here to seize the power of the bourgeoisie's control over the educational front, ensuring that the proletariat forever occupies the educational front!"

	The female student, moved by Liu Guiying's words, said, "Aunt Liu, in age you are my elder, in the Cultural Revolution you are my comrade-in-arms, in the educational revolution you are my superior, and in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought you are my good example. I will definitely, under the leadership of the working class, take the working class as my example, and carry the educational revolution to the end."

	“The Soldier Without Uniform”

	Every morning, after a clear bell rings, rows of orderly worker propaganda team members and revolutionary teachers and students come out for exercises, their slogans loud and solemn.

	If you ask why the revolutionary teachers and students of the mining academy have changed so quickly, everyone will tell you the story of a "soldier without uniform."

	The story goes like this. The old worker from the Wangfeng Mine, Yue Zhandian, is over fifty years old. Before liberation, he was injured in a gas explosion underground, and his legs are not very convenient for walking. After entering the mining academy, he found that many students were influenced by anarchist tendencies and had poor organizational discipline. He decided to lead the revolutionary teachers and students by his own actions to voluntarily observe revolutionary discipline. Therefore, despite his leg injury, he insisted on exercising every day. One day, his injured foot bled, and it was discovered by his comrades. The leading comrade asked him, "Why didn't you say anything?" Comrade Yue replied loudly, "Chairman Mao told us to learn from the People's Liberation Army, and we must have a high sense of organizational discipline."

	This incident spread like the wind throughout the academy, and everyone called Comrade Yue the "soldier without uniform." Comrade Yue told the students, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible.' Observing revolutionary discipline is the guarantee of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions." The students listened to Comrade Yue's words and remembered his exemplary actions. A student from the Mechanical and Electrical Department said shamefully, "I was influenced by anarchist tendencies for a long time and stayed outside without returning to school, truly disappointing Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely learn from the worker propaganda team, strengthen discipline, and achieve new merits for the people in the struggle, criticism, and reform."

    工人宣传队就是好
    红旗迎风舞，新歌满矿院。焦作矿业学院的革命师生，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，全校出现朝气蓬勃的革命景象。工人宣传队队员的足迹，遍及每个教室和宿舍；工人宣传队队员的事迹，被革命师生们热情地传颂着。
    “你是我的好榜样”
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、王封矿矿灯房工人刘桂英，已经年近五十了，革命师生都尊敬地叫她“刘大娘”。刘桂英听到让她参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的喜讯时，激动得热泪盈眶，一夜没合上眼。有人问她：“你年纪大了，又是文盲，大学能不能管起来？”她把毛主席的最新指示紧贴在心口，坚定地回答：“能！有毛主席给俺撑腰，俺啥都能管起来！在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，毛主席给俺一身胆，顶黑风，战恶浪，粉碎了阶级敌人的反扑。现在，毛主席让俺工人阶级领导教育革命，俺凭着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，一定要好好地把大学管起来！”
    进到矿院以后，刘桂英学习毛主席最新指示的劲头最足，对革命师生最亲，大家都愿意找她谈心。一天，地质系有个女学生问她：“刘大娘，听说工人宣传队是来夺矿院革委会的权来了，是吗？”刘桂英语重心长地回答说：“听这话可得想一想呵！我们工人阶级最支持革委会。毛主席教导我们：‘实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。’要讲我们是来夺权的，也对，我们是来夺资产阶级统治教育阵地的权的，使无产阶级永远占领教育阵地！”听了刘桂英的话，那个女学生激动地说：“刘大娘，在年纪上你是我的老一辈，在文化大革命中你是我的老战友，在教育革命中你是我的老上级，在活学活用毛泽东思想方面你是我的好榜样。我一定在工人阶级的领导下，以工人阶级为榜样，把教育革命进行到底。”
    不穿军装的“老战士”
    每天清晨，一阵清晰的铃声响过，一列列整齐的工人宣传队队员和革命师生的队伍就出操了，口号宏亮，严肃紧张。
    要问矿院革命师生的作风为啥转变得这么快，大家一定会给你讲一个“不穿军装的老战士”的故事。
    事情是这样的。王封矿老工人岳占田，今年五十多岁了，解放前因井下瓦斯爆炸，身体负伤，腿走路有些不方便。进矿院以后，他发现许多学生受无政府主义思潮的影响，组织纪律性比较差，便决心以自己的实际行动，带动革命师生，自觉地遵守革命纪律。于是，他不顾腿上的毛病，坚持每天出操。一天，他受过伤的脚出了血，被同志们发现了，带队的同志问他：“你怎么不说一声？”岳师傅响亮地回答：“毛主席让俺向解放军学习，俺就要有高度的组织纪律性。”
    这件事象风一样地在全院传开了，大家都叫岳师傅是“不穿军装的老战士”。岳师傅对学生们说：“毛主席教导我们：‘加强纪律性，革命无不胜。’遵守革命纪律是落实毛主席最新指示的保证。”学生们把岳师傅的话听在耳里，把他的模范行动记在心里。机电系的一个学生惭愧地说：“我过去在无政府主义思潮的影响下，长期在外不返校，真对不起毛主席。今后我一定要向工人宣传队学习，加强纪律性，在斗、批、改中为人民立新功。”
