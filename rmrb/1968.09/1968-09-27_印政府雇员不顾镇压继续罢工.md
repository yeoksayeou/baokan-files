Indian government employees and workers, despite the brutal suppression by the Indian reactionary government, continue their strike struggle.

The strike has dealt a new blow to the Indian reactionary government. In New Delhi, many government office buildings had to cease operations, and rail and maritime transport continued to be severely affected; in Calcutta, the work of thirty-five post and telegraph offices also came to a complete halt.

The Indian reactionary government has carried out savage and brutal fascist suppression against the striking masses. According to the greatly reduced official statistics from India, the number of people illegally arrested nationwide has reached ten thousand, and more than six thousand five hundred employees and workers have been illegally dismissed. However, the broad masses of government employees and workers have not been intimidated by the Indian reactionary government's use of force and threats of dismissal. They continue to fight in various places.

    印政府雇员不顾镇压继续罢工
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度政府雇员和工人不顾印度反动政府的残酷镇压，继续举行罢工斗争。
    罢工斗争给了印度反动政府以新的打击。在新德里，许多政府办公大楼不得不停止办公，铁路和航运继续受到严重影响；在加尔各答，三十五所邮电局的工作也完全处于停顿状态。
    印度反动政府对罢工群众进行野蛮残暴的法西斯镇压。据印度官方大大缩小了的统计数字，全国各地被非法逮捕的人达到一万名，被非法解雇的雇员和工人六千五百多人。然而，广大政府雇员和工人并没有被印度反动政府的武力镇压和解雇威胁所吓倒，他们继续在各地开展斗争。
