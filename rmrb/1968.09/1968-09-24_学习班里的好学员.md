At the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, there is a Li ethnic minority village nestled among mountains and surrounded by palm trees. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has brought about tremendous changes to this village. In every household, a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hangs neatly under the sunflower trellis. Everyone wears a shining Mao badge on their chest. Mao quotations boards are set up at the village entrance and by the fields, making the lush green palm trees appear red. The song "The East Is Red" and the shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" resonate through the palm trees, filling the village with a vibrant atmosphere.

In this village lives Su Atou, a Li ethnic minority poor peasant, who is over forty years old. The evil old society and the reactionary Kuomintang drove the Li people into the deep mountains, forcing them to live in misery. Su Atou's family also endured countless hardships and suffered from exploitation. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who saved them from their misery, established their home, and allowed them to live happily. Su Atou never forgets the past hardships and has an infinite love for the new society and the great leader Chairman Mao.

In May of this year, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain naval communications station stationed here came to the village to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. The news spread like wildfire throughout the village. From the white-haired Li elders to the little children, people from all directions rushed to participate in the study class. Su Atou was both happy and anxious. She was happy that the people's children, who were busy with their combat readiness work, came to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and bring Chairman Mao's latest instructions. She was anxious because her home was about ten li away from the study class, her husband was working at the reservoir construction site, and her youngest son still needed to be breastfed. With heavy household chores, it was difficult for her to leave. Kind-hearted neighbors advised her: "Wait until your husband comes back and participate in the next session of the study class." Su Atou believed that Chairman Mao is the savior of the Li people, and following Chairman Mao means victory. If she delayed her studies, how could she keep up with Chairman Mao? She decided to overcome all difficulties and participate in the first session of the study class to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions as soon as possible. Therefore, she got up before dawn every day, cooked the meals, took care of the household chores, and instructed the older children to take care of the house. She then carried her breastfeeding son and hurried to the study class. Every day, she was the first to arrive and studied very seriously.

This year, the village encountered a drought, and the seedlings could not be transplanted. The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements took the opportunity to cause trouble, spreading rumors and poisonous arrows, attempting to sabotage the collective economy. Some community members were influenced by the bad elements and lacked confidence in drought relief. As soon as the study class began, community member Fu Jifu proposed to go up the mountain to hunt. Su Atou heard this and felt something was wrong. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army, she and everyone else studied Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle." She took the lead in angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the "Three Frees and One Contract." She said, "The Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the 'Three Frees and One Contract' is to make us Li people suffer again from the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords, and shamans, and live the miserable life of hiding in caves, wearing leaves, and eating wild fruits. The 'Three Frees and One Contract' is like meat on a rat's trap; we Li poor and lower-middle peasants can never eat it. Only the collective path indicated by Chairman Mao is our bright path. Now, instead of engaging in collective production, we want to go up the mountain to hunt. This is falling for the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's 'Three Frees and One Contract,' a dead-end road." Her words were reasonable and greatly aroused the hatred of the Li poor and lower-middle peasants towards the Chinese Khrushchev, deepening their infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The study class launched a wave of exposing, denouncing, and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly enhancing everyone's class struggle and line struggle awareness. Fu Jifu also realized that his desire to go up the mountain to hunt was falling for the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's 'Three Frees and One Contract' and being deceived by the rich peasants, betraying Chairman Mao. He voluntarily exposed the rich peasants' crimes of spreading rumors and striking hard at the arrogance of the class enemies. The poor and lower-middle peasants' minds became clearer, their eyes brighter, their enthusiasm for production and disaster relief greater, and their resolve to follow the collective path firmer.

The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the Li village, and the entire village launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance," dug wells to fight the drought, and engaged in production and disaster relief. With the spirit of the Dazhai people, they overcame the drought and achieved a good harvest. This brigade was rated as a model for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the commune. The glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought shone brightly over the Li village.

    学习班里的好学员
    在海南岛的最南端，有一个群山环抱、椰林笼罩的黎家山寨。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命给这个山寨带来了天翻地覆的变化。家家的葵棚里都端端正正的挂上了伟大领袖毛主席的画像，人人胸前都佩戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，村头、地边修起了毛主席语录牌，把苍翠碧绿的椰林映得红彤彤的。《东方红》的歌声、“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆”的欢呼声在椰林上空激荡，山寨处处是一片热气腾腾的景象。
    在这个山寨里，住着黎族贫农社员苏阿尾大妈，她今年四十多岁了。万恶的旧社会、国民党反动派把黎族人民赶进深山老林，过着悲惨的生活。苏阿尾大妈的一家也历尽千辛万苦、尝尽了剥削之苦。是伟大领袖毛主席把他们从苦海中救了出来，建立了家园，过着幸福的生活。苏大妈念念不忘过去的苦，无限热爱新社会，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。
    今年五月，驻在这里的海军某观通站的毛泽东思想宣传队来到山寨办毛泽东思想学习班。这喜讯象插上翅膀，迅速传遍了全寨。从白发苍苍的黎族老大爷，到几岁的娃娃，从四面八方赶来参加学习班。苏阿尾大妈又是喜，又是急，喜的是毛主席教育的人民子弟兵在繁忙的战备工作中，还来宣传毛泽东思想，送来毛主席的最新指示；急的是自己家离学习班有十来里，丈夫又在水库工地上劳动，小儿子还要喂奶，家务重，难离开。好心的邻居都劝她：等丈夫回来，参加下一期的学习。苏大妈认为，毛主席是黎族人民的大救星，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。晚一点学习，怎么能紧跟毛主席呢？她决心排除一切困难，参加第一期学习班，早点学到毛主席的最新指示。于是，她每天天不亮就起床，煮好饭，料理好家务，吩咐大孩子看家，自己背着吃奶的孩子往学习班里赶。每天都是她到的最早，学习得非常认真。
    今年，这里遇到了旱象，秧苗插不下去。村里没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子乘机捣乱，造谣言、放毒箭，妄想破坏集体经济。个别社员受了坏人的影响，对抗旱救灾缺乏信心。学习班一开始，社员符吉富大爹就提出要上山打猎，苏阿尾大妈一听就觉得不对劲，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，她和大家一起学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，首先带头愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”的滔天罪行。她说：“中国赫鲁晓夫推行‘三自一包’就是要使我们黎家重新受国民党反动派、亩头（地主）、道公的欺压，重过那种蹲山洞、穿树叶、吃野果的悲惨生活，‘三自一包’是老鼠架子上的肉，我们黎族贫下中农万万吃不得。只有毛主席为我们指引的集体化道路才是我们的光明道。现在放着集体生产不搞，要上山打猎，这就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的‘三自一包’的毒，是一条死胡同。”她的话句句在理，大大激发了黎族贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。学习班掀起了一个对中国赫鲁晓夫大揭发、大控诉、大批判的热潮，大大提高了大家的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。符大爹也认识到自己要上山打猎是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的毒，受了富农分子的骗，对不起毛主席。他主动地揭发了富农分子造谣生事的罪行，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的嚣张气焰。贫下中农的心更明了，眼睛更亮了，生产救灾的劲头更足了，走集体化道路的意志更坚定了。
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照亮了黎寨，全寨掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，他们遵照毛主席“自力更生”的教导，打井抗旱，生产救灾，以大寨人的干劲，战胜了干旱，夺得了好收成，这个大队被评为公社活学活用毛主席著作的标兵。伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照得黎家山寨一片红。
