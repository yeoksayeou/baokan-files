Workers in a Uruguayan cold storage plant occupy the factory; Brazilian students bravely resist police suppression

	Workers and students in Uruguay, Brazil, and Bolivia have been continuously engaged in struggles in recent days, protesting against the reactionary measures and oppression of the people by their respective governments. In Uruguay, the workers' struggle has received support from progressive students.

	Recently, 2,000 workers at a state-owned cold storage plant in Uruguay occupied the factory to protest the government's unjust closure of the enterprise, which resulted in the unemployment of 2,600 cold storage workers. On the 29th, the reactionary government dispatched a large number of police to surround the factory, attempting to forcibly evict the workers. However, the workers put up a tenacious resistance, preventing the police from entering the factory. At this point, several hundred students rushed to support the workers' struggle. They built barricades with the workers around the factory to block the police from entering. During the struggle with the police, a female student was injured.

	On the 28th, students in the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo, held several demonstrations in the city to protest the government's so-called "special security measures" aimed at suppressing the people.

	The struggle by Brazilian students against the unjust arrest of students by the pro-American dictatorial regime in Brazil continues. On the 29th, a group of armed police stormed into the University of Brasília in the capital, arresting students, which sparked great indignation among the students. The students resisted the police who had entered the university by throwing stones and set a police car on fire. Recently, students in the capital of Paraná State, Curitiba, distributed leaflets on the streets to protest the government's persecution of students.

	In recent days, students in important cities such as Oruro, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz in Bolivia have held continuous demonstrations against the government. The demonstrators protested against the Bolivian government's violation of university autonomy and suppression of students. In Santa Cruz, the demonstrators also attacked the U.S. Consulate with stones.
