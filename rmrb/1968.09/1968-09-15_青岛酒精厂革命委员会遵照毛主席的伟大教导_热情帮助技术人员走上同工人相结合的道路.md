The Qingdao Alcohol Factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, has warmly assisted the factory's technical personnel in combining with workers. All technical personnel in the factory have humbly learned from workers, earnestly transformed their worldviews, and significantly improved their ideological awareness.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 14th, the Qingdao Alcohol Factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings that intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants, has enthusiastically helped the factory's technical personnel study and apply Chairman Mao's works, guiding them to firmly walk the path of combining with workers.

The factory has a total of 19 technical personnel, most of whom are recent graduates from higher and secondary schools. These technical personnel, due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, have some who have serious thoughts of fame and gain, are detached from reality, and look down on labor. Some even look down on the worker masses.

The factory once had an incident where, to meet the needs of seaweed gum production, the factory decided to trial-manufacture a high-speed centrifuge that rotates 15,600 times per minute. This task was given to three technical personnel and old workers to research together. However, during the research and trial-manufacturing process, disagreements arose: the old workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "The Chinese people have both the determination and the ability to catch up with and surpass the advanced level of the world in the not-too-distant future," advocated self-reliance and making the machine themselves. The few technical personnel, however, believed that the factory's equipment was outdated and the technical strength was weak, making it impossible to manufacture such a high-speed centrifuge. The old workers firmly said: Although the conditions are poor, there are indeed difficulties, but revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of any difficulties. Thus, five or six old workers held a "Zhuge Liang meeting," researching and working together. Through the workers' efforts, they quickly successfully trial-manufactured this machine. These technical personnel, witnessing the boundless wisdom of the working class, received a great education and began to actively learn from the workers, humbly learning from them, and earnestly transforming their worldviews.

The Revolutionary Committee, from this incident, more deeply understood that Chairman Mao's teaching that "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing" is an unshakable great truth. They decided to send graduates from higher and secondary schools to the workshops to work as workers, so that they could transform their standpoints, thoughts, and feelings under the education of the working class. Some technical personnel had difficulties participating in labor, and the committee members had heart-to-heart talks with them, studying with them Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectuals combining with workers and peasants, raising their political awareness, and encouraging them to decide to walk the path of combining with workers.

The factory Revolutionary Committee also paid attention to deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, mobilizing technical personnel to fiercely criticize the revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev, such as "expert management," "crawling philosophy," "technology first," and the "white expert road," and to eliminate the poison of the revisionist educational line among the technical personnel.

Because the factory Revolutionary Committee fully played the leading role of the working class and insisted on re-educating graduates from higher and secondary schools, all technical personnel in the factory have significantly improved their ideological awareness and expressed their determination to forever walk the path of combining with workers.

    青岛酒精厂革命委员会遵照毛主席的伟大教导
    热情帮助技术人员走上同工人相结合的道路
    全厂技术人员虚心向工人学习，认真改造世界观，思想觉悟有很大提高
    据新华社济南十四日电　青岛酒精厂革命委员会，遵照毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的教导，满腔热情地帮助本厂的技术人员学好用好毛主席著作，促使他们坚定不移地走同工人相结合的道路。
    这个厂共有技术人员十九名，其中多数是近几年分配到厂里来的高等和中等学校的毕业生。这些技术人员，由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，有些人名利思想比较严重，脱离实际，轻视劳动。有的人甚至看不起工人群众。
    厂里曾发生过这样一件事：为适应海藻胶生产的需要，工厂决定试制一台每分钟一万五千六百转的超速离心机。这个任务交给三个技术员和老工人一起研究。但是在研究试制过程中发生了分歧：老工人遵循毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，主张自力更生，自己动手试制。几个技术人员则认为，本厂设备落后，技术力量薄弱，制造这种超速离心机，根本不可能。老工人们坚定地说：条件差固然有困难，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人，什么困难也不怕。就这样，五六个老工人，开了个“诸葛亮会”，边研究边动手干起来。经过工人们的努力，终于很快把这种机器试制成功。这几个技术人员，亲眼看到工人阶级的无穷智慧，受到很大教育，从此，他们主动拜工人为师，虚心向工人学习，认真注意改造世界观。
    厂革委会从这件事情中更深刻地认识到毛主席教导的“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理，决定把高等和中等学校毕业的技术人员送到车间当工人，使他们在工人阶级的教育下变立场，变思想，变感情。有的技术人员对参加劳动有畏难情绪，革委会的同志便找他们谈心，和他们一起学习毛主席有关知识分子要和工农相结合的教导，提高他们的政治觉悟，促使他们下决心走和工人相结合的道路。
    厂革命委员会还注意在深入持久地开展革命大批判中，发动技术人员狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“专家治厂”、“爬行哲学”、“技术第一”、“白专道路”等反革命修正主义黑货，肃清修正主义教育路线在技术人员身上的流毒。
    这个厂的革委会由于充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，对学校毕业的技术人员坚持进行再教育，全厂从高等、中等学校毕业的技术人员，思想觉悟都有很大提高，表示要永远走同工人相结合的道路。
