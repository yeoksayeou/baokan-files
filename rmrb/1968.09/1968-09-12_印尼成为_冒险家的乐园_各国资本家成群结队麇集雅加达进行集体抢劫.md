Representatives of monopolistic capitalist groups from imperialist countries led by the United States are currently flocking to Jakarta in waves, engaging in frenzied activities to plunder Indonesia's rich resources.

According to a report from the American bourgeois news agency, a "delegation" composed of representatives from monopolistic capitalist groups in the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan began their activities in Jakarta on September 2. They are the first batch of representatives sent to Jakarta by these imperialist countries' monopolistic capitalist groups this September. According to Western news agencies, these blood-sucking vampires "are carefully examining the current investment climate in Indonesia." In addition to holding talks with officials from the Suharto-Nasution sellout government, they will also travel to various parts of Indonesia, including Bandung in West Java and Medan in North Sumatra, to "inspect the entire country."

According to reports, a group of capitalists representing 45 major companies from the United States and some European imperialist countries will arrive in Jakarta in the middle of September, led by American capitalists. This will be the second batch of representatives sent to Jakarta by these imperialist countries' monopolistic capitalist groups this September. According to the Associated Press, these individuals will hold meetings in Jakarta to "seek cooperation in trade and investment in Indonesia," and will also discuss with the Suharto-Nasution sellout government the "broad issues" of so-called "political stability" in Indonesia, that is, the further anti-communist and anti-people policies in Indonesia.

According to reports, monopolistic capitalist groups from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries will also send representatives to Indonesia to hold meetings in the middle of September to discuss the issue of plundering Indonesia's copra. This will be the third batch of representatives sent to Indonesia by these countries' monopolistic capitalist groups this September to engage in plundering activities. During their stay in Indonesia, in addition to holding meetings, they will also conduct so-called "inspections" of copra production in Central Java.

The situation does not end here. According to the United Press International, a group of representatives from American monopolistic capital and a group of representatives from Japanese capitalists will also arrive in Jakarta in September to engage in similar activities.

The above only describes the situation in September this year. In fact, since the Suharto-Nasution sellout government came to power three years ago, representatives of monopolistic capitalist groups from imperialist countries led by the United States have been continuously arriving in Indonesia. The wealth of the Indonesian nation that has been plundered by them is incalculable. The imperialist plunderers swarming into Indonesia and crazily looting the wealth of the Indonesian nation is the true face of the so-called "unprecedented prosperity" of the Indonesian economy that these imperialists have been repeatedly advocating. The banditry of these imperialists is arousing the great anger of the broad patriotic people of Indonesia. The just struggle of the Indonesian people against American imperialism and its lackeys, with rural armed struggle as the main form, is unfolding. With the victory of the just struggle of the Indonesian people, these imperialist plunderers who have fallen into the people's encirclement will eventually find out: the great Indonesian nation is inviolable!

    印尼成为“冒险家的乐园”
    各国资本家成群结队麇集雅加达进行集体抢劫
    新华社八日讯　雅加达消息：以美国为首的一些帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团的代表目前正一批接着一批地蜂涌到雅加达，为抢劫印度尼西亚的富饶资源而进行紧张的活动。
    据美国资产阶级通讯社透露，由美国、英国、法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、日本等国家的一些垄断资本集团的代表组成的一个“代表团”，九月二日在雅加达展开了活动。他们是这些帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团在今年九月派到雅加达去的第一批代表。据西方通讯社透露，这批大摆吃人宴的吸血鬼“正在仔细地审查目前在印度尼西亚投资的气候”。他们除了同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权的官员进行谈话外，还将分赴印尼各地，包括西爪哇的万隆和北苏门答腊的棉兰，“对整个印度尼西亚进行考察”。
    据报道，代表美国和欧洲一些帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团的四十五个大公司的一批资本家，在美国资本家的率领下，将在九月上中旬到雅加达活动。这将是这些帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团在今年九月派到雅加达的第二批代表。按美联社的说法，这些家伙在雅加达期间，将要召开会议，“对在印尼的贸易和投资方面寻求合作”，并且要同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权就印尼的所谓“政治稳定”方面的“广泛问题”，亦即在印尼进一步反共反人民的问题，进行讨论。
    据报道，美国、英国、荷兰等国一些垄断资本集团还将派出一些代表到印尼，在九月上中旬举行会议，就掠夺印尼的椰干问题进行专门讨论。这将是这些国家的垄断资本集团在今年九月派到印尼进行掠夺活动的第三批代表。他们在印尼期间除了开会以外，还将对中爪哇的椰干生产进行所谓“考察”。
    事情到这里还没有完。据合众国际社说，一批美国垄断资本的代表和一批日本资本家的代表，还将在九月这个月中分别到雅加达，进行同样性质的勾当。
    这里只是讲了今年九月的情况。事实上，在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权上台三年以来，在印尼，以美国为首的一些帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团的代表人物一直是鱼贯而至，络绎不绝的。被他们抢走的印尼民族的财富，不可胜计。帝国主义掠夺者麇集印尼，疯狂抢劫印尼民族的财富，这就是这些帝国主义者近来一再鼓吹的所谓印尼经济的“空前繁荣”的真相。帝国主义者的这种强盗行径，正在激起印尼广大爱国人民的极大愤怒。以农村武装斗争为主要形式的印尼人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争正在展开。随着印尼人民正义斗争的胜利发展，这些陷入人民的重围之中的帝国主义掠夺者终将发现：伟大的印度尼西亚民族不可侮！
