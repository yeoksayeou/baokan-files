The current excellent revolutionary situation is driving the production surge. The entire coal industry front is reporting victories, with new production records and technological innovations emerging continuously. Many major coal mines have overfulfilled their August production tasks; some coal mines that previously completed their tasks poorly have recently seen significant increases in output.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao personally approved the convening of the national coal industry front conference to seize the revolution and promote production, as well as the resolutions made by this conference, which are driving the rapid development of revolution and production on the coal industry front. Revolutionary workers, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the conference resolutions. A mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation is taking shape on the coal industry front. In August, the average daily output of coal mines under the Coal Industry Ministry increased by 39% compared to April before the conference, and the advance tunneling footage also saw significant increases; coal mine construction, geological exploration, and mechanical manufacturing units also presented new faces in revolution and production.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully tap the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in the struggle." Revolutionary workers on the coal industry front have repeatedly studied this latest instruction from Chairman Mao, deeply feeling the weight of their responsibility. They say: "The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instruction has greatly boosted the morale of the working class and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. In the old society, we coal miners were slandered as 'mine rats.' Today, we have become the masters of the state and the leading class. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely fully play the leading role of the working class." Many mining areas, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instruction, have launched a new wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have extensively carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the spirit of "seizing the day" to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Coal mines in Beijing, Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxing, Fushun, Nantian, Shuangyashan, Jixi, Liaoyuan, Shulan, Zaozhuang, Xinwen, Pingxiang, Jiaozuo, Hengshan, Weibei, and other places have all dispatched a group of outstanding workers, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committees in various places, to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They have marched into schools and some units that have not yet carried out struggle, criticism, and transformation well, shouldering the responsibility of leading the proletarian education revolution and struggle, criticism, and transformation in other domains of the superstructure. Some units that had not yet achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, such as the Huainan coal mine in Anhui, the Guanyintang and Yiluo coal mines in Henan, the Fushun coal mine in Liaoning, and the Jiaohe coal mine in Jilin, have even more closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have severely criticized the bourgeois reactionary theory of "multiple centers means no center," quickly achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and continuously improving production levels.

Deep and sustained revolutionary criticism is a powerful weapon for driving the vigorous development of revolution and production. One of the key reasons for the achievements on the national coal industry front is the launch of revolutionary criticism. Many mining areas in Beijing, Datong, Liaoyuan, Shuangyashan, Jiaozuo, Weibei, Aganzhen, Zhalainuoer, Handan, Xinmi, and other places have, while implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the resolutions of the coal industry conference, closely combined revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks. They have further criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the coal system, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "material incentives," and "money as the commander." They have criticized the bourgeois reactionary theory of "multiple centers," greatly raising class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, promoting the deepening of class struggle, and creating favorable conditions for party rectification. For example, the Shuangyashan coal mine held over 300 criticism meetings in August, severely striking down a handful of class enemies, leading to a dual leap in revolution and production. After exposing a handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, and spies in Kailuan and Jingxing coal mines, they used pre-shift and post-shift meetings and other spare time to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. They also used revolutionary criticism to further promote the work of cleansing class ranks, continuously raising the political awareness of revolutionary workers and greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of people.

Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to connect with the masses," many coal mines, while implementing the resolutions of the coal industry conference, combined with actual conditions, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist line in power construction. They also learned from the experience of the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee and took the path of streamlining administration and personnel. The Benxi Mining Bureau, while implementing streamlining administration and personnel, guided everyone to expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and local walking capitalists for promoting the revisionist line of managing enterprises and restoring capitalism, turning streamlining administration and personnel into a political and ideological battle to eliminate capitalism and establish communism. They fully mobilized the masses, breaking the old ideas, old concepts, and old habits in people's minds, quickly and successfully completing the entire work of streamlining organizations, reducing 76% of departmental cadres. After streamlining organizations, more than one-third of the departmental personnel in the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau happily went to the production front lines, living and working with the workers; some unreasonable regulations and systems have also been reformed.

The sixteen points personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The current excellent revolutionary situation on the national coal industry front is driving the production surge. Currently, the entire coal industry front is reporting victories, with new production records and technological innovations emerging continuously. In August, many major coal mines across the country overfulfilled their production tasks; some coal mines that previously completed their tasks poorly have recently seen significant increases in output. The revolutionary workers of the Shanxi Yangquan Mining Bureau, with the help of the PLA, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. After achieving revolutionary unity, they focused on class struggle, exposing a handful of hidden class enemies, creating an excellent revolutionary situation, and steadily increasing production. In July, coal production increased by 1.6 times compared to June, and in August, it increased by 24.5% compared to July. They not only overfulfilled the state production plan but also exceeded the normal production levels of previous years.

    广大革命职工把伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀变成巨大物质力量
    全国煤炭工业战线掀起群众性斗批改高潮
    当前的一派大好革命形势，正在推动着生产高潮的到来。整个煤炭工业战线捷报频传，生产新纪录和技术革新项目不断出现。许多主要煤矿超额完成了八月份生产任务；一些原来任务完成较差的煤矿，最近产量也有较大幅度增长
    新华社十四日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自批准召开全国煤炭工业战线抓革命促生产会议以及这个会议所作出的决议，正在推动着煤炭工业战线革命和生产的迅猛发展。广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，贯彻会议的决议。一个群众性的斗、批、改高潮，正在煤炭工业战线上形成。八月份，煤炭工业部所属煤矿的平均日产量，比会前的四月份提高了百分之三十九，开拓掘进进尺也有显著增加；煤矿基本建设、地质勘探和机械制造等单位的革命和生产也出现了新的面貌。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”煤炭工业战线广大革命职工，反复学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，深深感到自己责任的重大。他们说：“毛主席最新指示的发表，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。在旧社会，我们煤矿工人被污蔑为‘窑花子’，今天我们变成了国家的主人，成了领导阶级。我们决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，一定要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。”许多矿区在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，广泛开展了无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，以“只争朝夕”的精神落实毛主席的最新指示。北京、开滦、峰峰、井陉、阜新、南票、双鸭山、鸡西、辽源、舒兰、枣庄、新汶、萍乡、焦作、鹤壁、渭北等地的煤矿，都已抽出一批优秀工人，在各地革命委员会的统一领导下，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡开进了学校和一些还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，挑起了领导无产阶级教育革命和上层建筑其他领域斗、批、改工作的重担。一些原来没有实现革命大联合和革命三结合的单位，如安徽的淮北煤矿，河南的观音堂煤矿、宜洛煤矿，辽宁的抚顺煤矿以及吉林的蛟河煤矿的革命职工，更是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠批资产阶级反动的“多中心即无中心论”，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命三结合，生产水平不断提高。
    深入持久地开展革命的大批判，是推动革命、生产蓬勃发展的有力武器。全国煤炭工业战线能够取得上述成绩，重要原因之一，就是开展了革命的大批判。北京、大同、辽源、双鸭山、焦作、渭北、阿干镇、扎赉诺尔、邯郸、新密等许多矿区，在落实毛主席的最新指示和贯彻煤炭工业会议决议中，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，进一步批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭系统代理人推行的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“金钱挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，批判了资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了阶级斗争的深入发展，并且为整党创造了有利的条件。例如，双鸭山煤矿在八月份召开了三百多次各种类型的批判会，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，使革命和生产出现了双跃进的局面。开滦、井陉煤矿在揪出一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务等阶级敌人后，利用班前会、班后会和其他业余时间，人人口诛笔伐，深入开展革命大批判，并且用革命大批判来进一步推动清理阶级队伍的工作，使广大革命职工的政治觉悟在斗争中不断提高，大大地促进了人的思想革命化。
    遵循伟大领袖毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，许多煤矿在贯彻执行煤炭工业会议决议时，结合实际，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线，并且学习了灵宝县革命委员会的经验，走精兵简政的道路。本溪矿务局在实行精兵简政中，引导大家大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫和本单位走资派推行修正主义办企业路线复辟资本主义的罪行，使精兵简政变成了一场灭资兴无、破私立公的政治仗和思想仗，充分发动了群众，大破了人们头脑中的旧思想、旧观念和旧的习惯势力，结果又快又好地完成了精简机构的全部工作，精简了百分之七十六的科室干部。枣庄矿务局在精简机构以后，有三分之一以上的科室人员愉快地走上了生产第一线，和工人同吃同住同劳动；部分不合理的规章制度也已经得到改革。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”全国煤炭工业战线当前出现的一派大好的革命形势，正在推动着生产高潮的到来。目前，整个煤炭工业战线捷报频传，生产新纪录和技术革新项目不断出现。八月份，全国许多主要煤矿都超额完成了生产任务；一些原来生产任务完成得较差的煤矿，最近产量也比过去有较大幅度的增长。山西阳泉矿务局广大革命职工，在解放军的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在实现革命大联合以后，狠抓阶级斗争，挖出了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，革命形势一片大好，生产稳步上升。七月份煤炭产量比六月份提高一点六倍，八月份又比七月份提高百分之二十四点五，不仅超额完成了国家生产计划，而且超过了历年来正常的生产水平。
