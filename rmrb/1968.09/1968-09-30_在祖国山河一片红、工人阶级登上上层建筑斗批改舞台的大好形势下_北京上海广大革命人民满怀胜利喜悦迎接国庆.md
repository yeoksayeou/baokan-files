They are determined to present the excellent results of double victories in revolution and production to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao.

On the eve of the festival, the capital is shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. From the majestic Tiananmen Square to every street and alley, from industrial and mining enterprises to rural people's communes, as well as offices, shops, and schools, everywhere you can see the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and the placards with quotations from Chairman Mao. Slogans such as "The working class must lead everything!" "Learn from the working class!" "Salute to the working class!" "Learn from the PLA!" "Salute to the PLA!" are prominently displayed throughout the city.

The Tiananmen Square on the eve of the festival is even more magnificent. The workers of the capital have decorated the Tiananmen City Tower and the square anew. A giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao is prominently displayed in the center of the Tiananmen City Tower, and giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are erected on both sides of the square. On the edges of the observation stands on both sides of the Tiananmen City Tower, there are new and bright slogans: "Turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!" "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!" In recent days, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses have been rehearsing songs and dances in Tiananmen Square every day, preparing to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao on the festival day.

The Beijing Railway Station and the capital's airport are adorned with red flags. Revolutionary masses hold red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and portraits of Chairman Mao, welcoming batches of workers' representatives and representatives from various sectors coming from all over the country to attend the National Day celebration, as well as friends from abroad. The workers' representatives from various places are guests of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. They come to Beijing to celebrate the National Day with the people of the capital.

In the days leading up to the festival, the capital's industry, agriculture, and other fronts present a great situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the working class is the leading class," the working class of the capital has sent a large number of outstanding representatives, together with the soldiers of the PLA, to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, marching into schools and other domains of the superstructure, leading the struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieving remarkable results. The workers who remain in industrial and mining enterprises are vigorously seizing the revolution and promoting production, also achieving great results. The printing workers are working day and night to print Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics and portraits. The revolutionary staff of the Xinhua Bookstore have made preparations for the festival to issue Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics and portraits.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Beijing who have achieved a bumper harvest in autumn are now fighting on the autumn battlefields. They are determined to win this battle of autumn and welcome the National Day.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 29th: The working class and revolutionary masses of Shanghai, who are advancing in step with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are filled with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, welcoming the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with outstanding achievements in the struggle, criticism, and reform and excellent production results.

The continuous victories of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the great revolutionary situation where the whole country is red have greatly inspired the million industrial workers and revolutionary masses of Shanghai. In recent days, the entire city of Shanghai is filled with the joyous atmosphere of the festival. From the main streets to the alleys, everywhere you can see the giant color portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, the placards with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and poems, paintings, and articles praising the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Along the Huangpu River and Nanjing Road, red flags are flying, and strings of colorful lights are hung. Slogans such as "Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform thoroughly," "Summon up great efforts and strive for the forefront, and launch a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production," and "The working class must lead everything" fully express the revolutionary will and firm determination of the working class and revolutionary people of Shanghai to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Since September, the revolutionary people of Shanghai, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions, have fully played the leading role of the working class, and a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and reform has surged on all fronts. The vast army of industrial workers has formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and entered various departments of the superstructure and all units that have not carried out the struggle, criticism, and reform well. The broad masses of workers who remain at their production posts are full of vigor and enthusiasm, seriously summarizing experiences, conducting in-depth investigations, and making overall plans, further launching a high tide of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform. The Dongfanghong Shipyard has written seventy-nine investigation reports with clear viewpoints and full of proletarian feelings by nearly a hundred investigation teams, and combined investigation and research with revolutionary criticism, raising the struggle, criticism, and reform movement of the factory to a new level on the basis of criticizing the revisionist line of managing enterprises. The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have carried out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work through the mass Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on re-educating intellectuals. Advanced units such as the No. 17 Cotton Mill and the No. 1 Valve Factory have taken actual actions to carry out party rectification work, welcoming the brilliant 19th National Day.

The great wave of struggle, criticism, and reform has promoted the rapid development of production. In recent days, the industrial and commercial front of Shanghai has continuously reported good news of seizing the revolution and promoting production. The factories that have sent outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have seen their production continue to rise. Some have even created the highest production level in the history of the factory. The production of the whole city in September will greatly exceed the highest level in the same period in history.

    节日前夕的首都，处处闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。从雄伟的天安门广场到大街小巷，从工矿企业到农村人民公社，以及机关、商店、学校，到处可以看到伟大领袖毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌。“工人阶级必须领导一切！”“向工人阶级学习！”“向工人阶级致敬！”“向解放军学习！”“向解放军致敬！”等醒目的标语贴满全城。
    节日前的天安门显得更加壮丽。首都工人已把天安门城楼和广场装饰一新。天安门城楼中央高挂伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，广场两侧竖立起马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨幅画像。天安门城楼两边的观礼台上边，写着崭新的大标语：“把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校！”“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这几天，每天都有成千上万的革命群众，在天安门广场精心排练歌舞，准备节日接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
    北京火车站和首都机场红旗招展，革命群众手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛主席画像，在这儿迎接了一批批参加国庆观礼的来自祖国各地的工人阶级代表和各方面的代表，以及来自国外的朋友。各地工人阶级代表，是伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的客人。他们来到北京，同首都人民一起欢度国庆。
    首都工业、农业和其他各条战线，节日前呈现着抓革命、促生产的大好形势。在毛主席“工人阶级是领导阶级”的最新指示鼓舞下，首都工人阶级抽出大批优秀代表，和解放军战士一起，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡开进了学校和上层建筑其他领域，领导斗、批、改，取得了显著成绩。留在工矿企业的工人狠抓革命，猛促生产，也取得很大成绩。广大印刷工人正夜以继日地赶印毛主席的革命宝书和毛主席画像。新华书店革命职工已为节日发行毛主席的革命宝书和毛主席画像做好了准备。
    在毛泽东思想指引下夺得了秋季大丰收的北京郊区广大贫下中农，正战斗在三秋战场上，他们决心打好三秋这一仗，迎接国庆。
    据新华社上海二十九日电　紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署阔步前进的上海工人阶级和广大革命群众，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，以深入开展斗、批、改的出色成果和优异的生产成就，迎接中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，全国山河一片红的大好革命形势，给上海百万产业工人和广大革命群众以极大的鼓舞。这几天，整个上海充满了节日的欢乐气氛。从通衢大道到里弄小巷，到处悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅彩色画像，到处是毛主席最新指示的语录牌，到处是歌颂毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线伟大胜利的诗、画和文章。黄浦江畔、南京路上，红旗招展，彩灯成串。“紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改”、“鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮”、“工人阶级必须领导一切”等巨幅标语，充分表达了上海工人阶级和革命人民进一步落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的革命意志和坚强决心。
    九月以来，上海市革命人民在伟大领袖毛主席一系列光辉指示指引下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，各条战线上掀起了一个波澜壮阔的伟大的斗、批、改高潮。浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻上层建筑领域各部门和一切没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。留在生产岗位上的广大工人，意气风发，斗志昂扬，认真总结经验，深入调查研究，全面规划，进一步掀起了大学习、大落实毛主席最新指示，全面开展斗、批、改的热潮。东方红造船厂近百个调查组写出了七十九份观点鲜明、充满无产阶级感情的调查报告，并且把调查研究和革命大批判结合起来，在批判修正主义办企业路线的基础上，把工厂的斗、批、改运动提高到一个新的水平。上海机床厂工人通过大办群众性的毛泽东思想学习班，做深入细致的思想政治工作，进一步落实了毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的指示。国棉十七厂、阀门一厂等先进单位，以认真开展整党工作的实际行动，迎接光辉灿烂的国庆十九周年。
    伟大的斗、批、改高潮，推动了生产的迅速发展。连日来，上海工交战线不断传来抓革命、促生产的捷报。全市抽出优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队的工厂，生产仍然节节上升。有些还创造了本厂生产的历史最高水平。全市九月份的生产，将大大超过历史上同期的最高水平。
