The armed forces of the people of Northeast Thailand, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have, with the close cooperation and support of the people, once again achieved victory in smashing the counter-revolutionary military "encirclement and suppression" launched by the U.S.-Thai reactionaries by fully exerting the mighty power of people's war.

The radio station said that the people and armed forces of Northeast Thailand, with unshakable fighting spirit, have bravely resisted the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thanom clique by employing the strategies and tactics of people's war advocated by Chairman Mao Zedong. In recent battles, the armed forces have killed and wounded more than 150 enemy troops, shot down two enemy aircraft, and inflicted a humiliating defeat on the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression."

The radio station said that the rapid development and growth of the armed struggle in Northeast Thailand have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique. To stem the development of the people's armed struggle in Northeast Thailand, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries mobilized 15 battalions of troops, including the army and police, equipped with airplanes, tanks, and artillery, to launch a mad "encirclement and suppression" against the people and armed forces in the provinces of Sakhon Nakhon, Kalasin, and Nakhon Phanom from March to July this year, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the people's armed struggle. However, the enemy's savage and barbaric suppression failed to extinguish the blazing flames of revolution.

The radio station said that the victory of the armed forces in resisting the "encirclement and suppression" has once again exposed the paper tiger nature of the U.S.-Thanom clique and demonstrated that the people and armed forces of Northeast Thailand are fully capable of overcoming all difficulties and defeating the seemingly powerful enemy.

    发挥人民战争强大威力　沉重打击美泰反动派
    泰国东北部人民武装粉碎敌人反革命“围剿”
    新华社四日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台三日广播，泰国共产党领导下的英勇的泰国东北部人民武装，在人民群众的密切配合和支持下，发挥了人民战争的强大威力，再一次取得粉碎美泰反动派的反革命军事“围剿”的胜利。
    电台说，泰国东北部人民和人民武装以坚定不移的战斗精神，运用毛泽东主席人民战争的战略战术，英勇地抗击美国—他侬集团的反革命“围剿”。在最近十几次战斗中，人民武装共打死打伤敌人一百五十多名，击毁敌机二架，使敌人的反革命“围剿”遭到了可耻的失败。
    这家电台说，东北部人民武装斗争的迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击着美国—他侬反动集团。美泰反动派为了阻挡东北部人民革命武装斗争的发展，在今年三月到七月，曾出动包括军队、警察等，共达十五个营的兵力，配备飞机、坦克、大炮等武器，对东北部沙功那空、加拉信、那空拍侬等府的人民和人民武装进行疯狂“围剿”，妄图扑灭人民武装斗争烈火。但是，敌人的疯狂野蛮镇压，都无法扑灭熊熊燃烧的革命烈火。
    电台说，人民武装反“围剿”的胜利，再一次暴露了美国—他侬集团的纸老虎本质，并表明东北部人民和人民武装完全能够排除一切困难，战胜貌似强大的敌人。
