De Gaulle Holds Press Conference in Paris
Criticizes US-Soviet Collusion to Divide Europe and Impose Hegemony
Reiterates France's Refusal to Be Controlled by the US and Aims to Compete with US and Soviet in Europe
Deeply Fears Domestic Revolutionary Storms, Attempts to Suppress People's Struggles with Deception and Threats

Paris, September 12 (Xinhua) — French President Charles de Gaulle held a press conference on September 9, criticizing the US and Soviet Union for dividing Europe into spheres of influence and imposing hegemony. He stated that France would continue its policy of competing with the US and Soviet Union in Europe. In discussing domestic issues, de Gaulle revealed the French ruling class's anxiety about the possibility of a renewed revolutionary uprising by the French people.

De Gaulle has long pursued French imperialist interests, seeking to dominate Europe and establish a so-called "Europe of the Europeans." Therefore, in the press conference, he on the one hand expressed opposition to the US and Soviet Union colluding to "divide Europe into two," opposing the division of Europe into two blocs dominated by the US and Soviet Union. On the other hand, he advocated for France to continue its policy of "coordination, détente, and cooperation" in Europe, urging the Soviet Union and Eastern European revisionist cliques to follow the "predetermined direction" of "evolution."

De Gaulle accused the US and Soviet Union of dividing Europe into spheres of influence, tacitly acknowledging each other's "supreme" hegemony within their respective spheres. He said, "I cannot accept that the future of Europe should be decided without Europe." He also stated, "I cannot accept the supreme right to dominate others (allies or enemies). Two great powers already in contention for their armies have jointly demarcated a boundary line, each claiming such a right on their own side."

In the press conference, De Gaulle once again opposed the waning US hegemony in Western Europe. He emphasized, "France does not want to be controlled by the United States, does not want to be swallowed by the United States." Therefore, France "gradually withdrew from the military organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, where Europeans are controlled by Americans in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He said that for this reason, France, since participating in the Western European "Common Market," "has never agreed" to establish a "supranational system of six countries that can only follow policies from across the Atlantic."

De Gaulle bluntly stated that one of the reasons the French government has opposed Britain's entry into the "Common Market" is to "avoid being swallowed by the Atlantic."

The French ruling class, which suffered heavy blows from the French workers' and students' movements in May and June, has been deeply fearful for over two months that workers and students might launch another wave of mass revolutionary struggles in the autumn. De Gaulle spent a significant portion of the press conference discussing domestic issues. He once again used political deception and threats to intimidate, attempting to alleviate French people's discontent, soften workers' and students' resolve, and stabilize the rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie.

De Gaulle in the conference vigorously peddled his so-called "reform" plan, talking about "reforming" universities, enterprises, and the Senate, allowing students and workers to "participate" in related affairs, attempting to deceive workers and students into abandoning their just struggles. At the same time, he made blatant threats against French workers and students. He said that the precondition for "reform" is that "order must be maintained everywhere," and the French government will suppress and crush "any threat or violence." He also threatened, "It is unacceptable to use university premises and study time for political propaganda." Western news agencies believe that de Gaulle's remarks reflect his "anxious mood" about the possibility of a renewed large-scale student struggle.

### 戴高乐在巴黎举行记者招待会  抨击美苏勾结瓜分欧洲实行霸主统治

    戴高乐在巴黎举行记者招待会
    抨击美苏勾结瓜分欧洲实行霸主统治
    再次表示法国不愿受美国控制要同美苏争霸欧洲
    十分害怕国内人民革命风暴再起，妄图用欺骗威胁手段扼杀人民斗争
    新华社十二日讯巴黎消息：法国总统戴高乐九日举行记者招待会，抨击美苏在欧洲划分势力范围，实行霸主统治的行径，表示要继续执行同美帝、苏修争霸欧洲的政策。戴高乐在谈到国内问题时，透露了法国统治集团害怕法国人民革命风暴再起的惶惶不安的心情。
    戴高乐多年来从法国帝国主义的利益出发，一直追求法国称霸欧洲，建立所谓“欧洲人的欧洲”。因此，他在记者招待会上一方面表示反对美帝、苏修互相勾结“把欧洲分割为二”，反对把欧洲分成由美、苏主宰的“两个集团”；另一方面，又标榜法国要继续推行所谓“协调、缓和和合作”的欧洲政策，要苏修和东欧修正主义集团循着“既定的方向”进行“演变”。
    戴高乐指责美帝、苏修在欧洲划分势力范围，彼此默认对方在它的势力范围内享有“至高无上”的霸权。他说，我不能承认“欧洲的未来应该撇开欧洲来作决定”。他还说，“我不能接受有支配别人（盟友或敌人）的至高无上的权利，两个已经在角逐的大国为它们的军队所共同划定的分界线的自己一方业已宣称有这种权利”。
    戴高乐在记者招待会上再一次反对美国在西欧的摇摇欲坠的霸权。他强调说：法国不愿受美国控制，不愿被美国吞并。因此，法国“逐步地脱离了北大西洋公约组织的军事组织，在北大西洋公约组织里面欧洲人是受美国人控制的”。他说，也正是为了这个，法国在参加西欧“共同市场”以来，“从来不同意”成立“只能奉行来自大洋另一边的政策”的“六国的超国家体系”。
    戴高乐还直截了当地说，法国政府迄今为止一直反对英国参加“共同市场”的“理由之一”，就是为了“避免受大西洋吞并”。
    今年五、六月受到法国工人学生运动沉重打击的法国统治集团，两个多月来一直十分害怕法国工人和学生会在秋天再次掀起群众性的革命斗争。戴高乐在记者招待会上用了大部分时间谈国内问题。他又一次用政治欺骗和威胁恐吓的两面手法，妄图缓和法国人民的不满，软化工人和学生的斗志，以稳住法国垄断资产阶级的统治。
    戴高乐在会上极力兜售他的所谓“改革”方案，大谈什么“改革”大学、企业和参议院，让学生和工人“参加”有关的事务，妄图借此诱骗工人和学生放弃正义的斗争；同时，他对法国工人和学生进行露骨的威胁。他说，进行“改革”的前提条件是“各地都应保持秩序”，法国政府将镇压和粉碎“任何威胁或暴力”。他还扬言，“大学校址和学习时间被用来进行政治要求的宣传，是不能容许的”。西方通讯社认为，戴高乐的这些话表明他害怕再次爆发大规模学生斗争的“忧虑的心情”。
