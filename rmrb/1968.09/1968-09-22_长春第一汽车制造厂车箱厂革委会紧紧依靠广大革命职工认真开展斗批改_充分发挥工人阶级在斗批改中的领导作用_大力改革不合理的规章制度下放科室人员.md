The Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, has followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "To fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work," and has relied closely on revolutionary workers to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have vigorously reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, streamlined departments, and reformed old systems and old styles. The struggle, criticism, and transformation mass movement has been carried out vigorously, and the production situation is better than ever.

Relying on the masses of workers to deeply expose the superstructure that does not conform to the socialist economic base and continuously improve the understanding of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation

Since the establishment of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, Khrushchev and his agents in the factory have stubbornly pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist line for managing the enterprise. From the establishment of departments to the division of labor, from production to operation and management, from the main factory to the branch factories, almost everything was copied from the revisionist and capitalist system.

In April this year, the Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory began to reform old departments, old systems, and old styles. However, due to the lack of understanding of the great significance of the struggle, criticism, and transformation by some comrades, the reform work once made little progress.

Workers, seeing this situation, pointed out bluntly: "The Revolutionary Committee is a new regime, new personnel, but it is walking the old path. It is not the new reforming the old, but the old influencing the new. If this continues, there is a danger of 'revisionism'."

The workers' sharp criticism drew the attention of the Revolutionary Committee. They reviewed the path they had taken and deeply felt that the old regulations and systems were constantly eroding the newly born Revolutionary Committee. If you do not reform it, it will reform you. If this continues, you will go back to the old path. It must be thoroughly reformed.

To further improve everyone's understanding, the Revolutionary Committee, together with the workers, exposed and criticized the old regulations and systems that do not conform to the socialist economic base and the harmful consequences of Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power. Workers said: "The old departments have many bureaus and many levels, and when things are done, there is a lot of red tape. When there is a problem, it is hard to find. It is completely a bureaucratic organization that serves the restoration of capitalism. At that time, workers had to go through three doors and six gates to see the factory director and the secretary." The old departments were departments to control workers, and the old systems were systems to control workers. Old worker Liu Yongfu once found that his lathe had lost a pin during production. Out of the revolutionary responsibility of the working class to be the master, he did not find the maintenance duty officer but installed the pin himself after cleaning it. Unexpectedly, instead of being encouraged, he was criticized for violating the technical operation procedures. At the criticism meeting, he angrily said: "We workers are the masters of the factory, the masters of the machines. But in the past, workers did not even have the right to touch the machines. It was as if living people were treated as dead, and workers were treated as slaves." The poison of money worship and material incentives was even greater. Just in the Car Body Factory, there were as many as twenty-three kinds of rewards, including safety rewards, quality rewards, quarterly rewards, mid-year rewards, year-end rewards, and discretionary rewards. In addition, there was a kind of "group leader allowance" (workers called it worry money), which was three yuan per month for group leaders managing fewer than ten people and four yuan per month for group leaders managing more than twenty people. At the criticism meeting, workers angrily said: "This reward and that reward, there is not a bit of Mao Zedong Thought; this fee and that fee are all travel expenses to capitalism. Those few capitalist-roaders are using these things to drag us onto the capitalist road."

Through exposure and criticism, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee further realized: the old regulations and systems that do not conform to the socialist economic base were used by a small handful of class enemies to serve the restoration of capitalism in the past. Now, if we do not thoroughly destroy the old superstructure, it will become the ideological and organizational basis for the class enemies to restore capitalism. Only by mobilizing the broad masses of revolutionary workers to eliminate the old foundation and establish a superstructure that serves the socialist economic base, can we consolidate the new revolutionary regime and make the factory's power truly in the hands of the working class.

Relying on the masses of workers to continuously overcome the interference and sabotage of the enemy in the struggle, criticism, and transformation

Chairman Mao said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the Party, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory deeply felt in its revolutionary practice: reforming the old regulations and systems that do not conform to the socialist economic base is not just a matter of reducing a few people, eliminating a few departments, and abolishing a few old regulations and systems, but a sharp and complex class struggle, a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Only by relying on the masses of workers and continuously overcoming the interference and sabotage of the class enemies can we carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

When streamlining departments, the Revolutionary Committee selected a group of new forces to be absorbed into the new departments, and a small handful of class enemies incited bourgeois factionalism behind the scenes to sabotage. They said: "This faction has more people, that faction has fewer people," "The Revolutionary Committee is biased, the decision is wrong." The Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and realized that struggle is inevitable. Therefore, they mobilized the masses to expose a saboteur who was trying to disrupt the streamlining of departments and smashed the enemy's arrogant attack.

One struggle ended, and another began. When the Revolutionary Committee gathered the departmental personnel to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class to deeply expose the harm of the old departments, the enemy was sabotaging again, saying, "Once the study class is held, the cadres will become like a rabbit's tail—it won't grow long." They incited cadres not to participate in the study and spread the fallacy of "if you go down, let everyone go down," putting pressure on the Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee, together with the broad masses of revolutionary workers, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship state, they long for the old society. Once they get the chance, they will stir up trouble..." and realized: reform is struggle, a small handful of class enemies will not willingly perish, only by carrying out the struggle against the enemy to the end can we carry out the reform to the end. The Revolutionary Committee, together with the workers, launched a counterattack against the class enemies, and soon exposed a small handful of class enemies.

In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory, relying on the masses of workers and revolutionary cadres, repelled the class enemies' repeated frenzied counterattacks and thoroughly smashed the enemies' evil plot to sabotage the struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the struggle, they realized: the old regulations and systems are a battlefield for a small handful of class enemies who are facing imminent destruction to make their last struggle, and an important fortress for the enemies to make their final resistance against the proletariat and the new revolutionary regime. The enemies intend to defend this battlefield and use this battlefield to attack the new revolutionary regime. Therefore, in the reform, we must not only not reform, but also not use the method of "peaceful reform." We must rely on the masses to carry out the reform in the class struggle. Only in this way can we destroy the enemies' battlefield, capture the enemies' fortress, and continuously win new victories.

Mobilize the masses of workers to consciously carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and thoroughly complete the historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation

In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory realized that to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well, in addition to continuously fighting against the sabotage and interference of the class enemies, it is also necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses to fight against the private thoughts in their own minds. Only by reforming the thoughts in one's mind can one reform the superstructure that does not conform to the socialist economic base.

This revolution began with the Revolutionary Committee changing the old style.

When the Revolutionary Committee was changing the old style, the first problem they encountered was whether or not to have an office and what kind of office to have. Some comrades thought that the factory had many people, and in the past, even with more than ten offices, they could not do the work well, so now they still needed a decent office.

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link up with the masses." The Revolutionary Committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and realized: this is not just a problem of the office, but a problem of whether or not to carry out the revolution and whether or not to reform the old style of "acting like an official." Then, they organized everyone to criticize the thought of "acting like an official." Old worker Wang Xiqin said: "The 'public' in the office is the masses. If you leave the masses to do the office work, it is an empty office. In the past, the office was not for the 'public,' but for the 'private,' not for serving the people, but for 'acting like an official.' As a result, the more you do, the more private it becomes, the more you do, the more 'revisionist' it becomes." With the improvement of understanding, the Revolutionary Committee decided to keep only one room, which would serve as both the working room of the Revolutionary Committee and the study room.

In the reform of the old departments, it is important to rely on the workers to do a good job in the ideological and political work of the departmental personnel who are to be transferred. At the beginning, the departmental personnel had great resistance in the issue of staying or being transferred. Some said: "It's not easy to do up there, and it's not easy to look down there." The original technical department had two cadres, and the Revolutionary Committee decided to keep one and transfer one. At the beginning, both of them had difficulties in their minds. The one who was transferred felt that he had lost face; the one who stayed felt that one person had to bear the work of several people and was afraid that he could not shoulder the responsibility. The Revolutionary Committee organized them to study while doing ideological and political work for them. Workers found these two cadres to talk heart to heart, and some old workers also told them about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, arousing their class consciousness. The enthusiastic help from the workers greatly educated and inspired these two technical cadres. They brought their problems to further study Chairman Mao's teaching, "To fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism," and quickly removed their worries. The cadre who stayed had a lot of work to do, and the workers helped him study and solve problems together. When they encountered problems, they helped him come up with ideas and find solutions. He worked better than before. Workers praised him, "He has a lot of enthusiasm, he is really great!" The cadre who was transferred worked and studied with the workers, fought against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, and solved problems in production together. Workers reflected: "Although the cadres have not been down for long, they have changed a lot." He himself also felt: "Being with the workers is not losing 'face,' but losing bourgeois ideology and gaining proletarian ideology." Through the practice of streamlining departments, many cadres deeply felt: "It's hard to do, it's hard to look, it's the 'selfishness' that is causing trouble. After getting rid of the 'selfishness,' the one who stays is at ease, and the one who goes down is happy."

The mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation has destroyed the old superstructure and consolidated and developed the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the Revolutionary Committee of the Car Body Factory, relying on revolutionary workers, used revolutionary criticism to destroy the old regulations and systems that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and then relied on revolutionary workers to use Mao Zedong Thought to build a new regime and establish new regulations and systems, and set up a new style of closely linking with the masses, further consolidating and developing the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They abolished the original five departments and three offices, improved and strengthened the working organs of the Revolutionary Committee, reducing the number of cadres from seventy-seven to eighteen; abolished and reformed many unreasonable regulations and systems, replaced material rewards with political appraisals, replaced economic attendance with political attendance, replaced "expert management" with mass management, and formed a technical management group consisting of workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres, and established a design room for the masses, fundamentally breaking away from the old departments and old regulations and systems.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee worked among the masses, first focusing on class struggle. The criticism in the machining section had always been relatively weak, and the capitalist-roaders took the opportunity to carry out a reversal. After the director of the Revolutionary Committee, Wang Ronggao, went to this section, he studied with the workers Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and used revolutionary criticism to launch a fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies, smashing the class enemies' wind of reversal and making the revolutionary criticism go deeper and deeper.

After the members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the grassroots, some problems that had long been unsolved were quickly solved. The wood used to produce car bodies was previously constrained by old regulations and systems, causing transportation, management, and use to be disconnected. Because the wood could not be transported to the warehouse in time, it was piled up on the loading and unloading line for a long time, affecting railway transportation, and production could not be supplied in time. A large number of wood was scrapped due to rain and sun exposure. Since the establishment of the factory, workers had repeatedly proposed suggestions, but they were not solved and were known as the "old difficult problem." The members of the production group of the Revolutionary Committee went to the workshop and worked with the workers, studied together, broke away from the constraints of the old regulations and systems, and implemented the unified dispatching of transportation, management, and use, quickly solving the problem.

The ideological revolution strongly promoted the technological revolution. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee, the departmental cadres who were transferred, and the technical personnel worked with the workers to fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, worked together, greatly accelerated the ideological revolution, and strongly promoted the technological revolution. The mechanized equipment for stacking wood, which was previously sealed by the capitalist-roaders as a technical "authority," was not completed after more than five years of work, and the installed parts could not be used at all. After the cadres, technical personnel, and workers worked together, they successfully reformed a single-rail crane in just thirty-two hours, changing manual handling to mechanical operation and increasing the handling efficiency by ten times. The "three-in-one" technological innovation team not only reformed the old technological equipment but also successfully developed the first transformer in China suitable for various types of welding machines. This transformer's weight and volume are only 30% of the same capacity old transformer, reaching the world's most advanced technological level. These living facts have a deep educational significance for everyone.

At present, the revolution in the Car Body Factory is booming, production is booming, the mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation is developing in depth, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and in-depth, and the spiritual face of the broad masses of workers has undergone profound changes. The revolution has promoted production, and the production of car bodies has been rising day by day, creating the highest record of daily output since the establishment of the factory.

    充分发挥工人阶级在斗批改中的领导作用  大力改革不合理的规章制度下放科室人员
    革委会率领广大革命职工，击退了一小撮阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，彻底粉碎了他们妄图破坏斗批改的罪恶阴谋，大力改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，革命生产形势空前大好
    本报讯　长春第一汽车制造厂车箱厂革委会，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照我们的伟大领袖毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，紧紧依靠革命职工，搞好斗、批、改，大力改革了不适应社会主义经济基础的规章制度，精简了机构，改革了旧制度，改变了旧作风，斗、批、改的群众运动轰轰烈烈，生产形势空前大好。
    依靠工人群众深刻揭露不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，不断提高对搞好斗、批、改的认识
    长春第一汽车制造厂从建厂以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人，顽固地推行了一条反革命修正主义的办企业路线，从机构设置到人员分工，从生产到经营、管理，从总厂到分厂，上上下下，几乎全是照搬修正主义、资本主义的一套。
    今年四月，车箱厂革委会就着手改革旧机构、旧制度、旧作风。但是，开始由于部分同志对斗、批、改的伟大意义认识不足，所以改革工作一度进展不大。
    工人看到这种情况，一针见血地指出：“革委会是新政权，新人员，走的却是老路子。不是新的在改造旧的，而是旧的在影响新的，这样下去，就有‘修’掉的危险。”
    工人的尖锐批评，引起了革委会的重视。他们回顾前一段所走过的路，深切地感到旧的规章制度，对新生的革委会随时都在进行侵蚀，你不改造它，它就改造你，长此下去，就会走回头路。必须彻底改革。
    为了进一步提高大家的认识，革委会又和工人群众一起，对不适应社会主义经济基础的规章制度，对中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设问题上推行的反革命修正主义路线所造成的恶果，进行了大揭露、大批判。工人说：“旧机构科多、长多，办起事来扯皮多，有了问题找不着。完全是一个官僚机构，是为复辟资本主义服务的机构。那时工人见厂长、书记，要过三道门六道关。”旧机构是治工人的机构，旧制度也是治工人的制度。老工人刘永富在一次生产中，发现自己的机床掉了一个插销，他出于工人阶级当家做主的革命责任感，没有找到维修值班员，自己就把插销擦干净安了上去。哪知不但没有得到鼓励，反而被认为是违反了技术操作规程，受到了批评。在批判会上，他愤怒地说：“我们工人是工厂的主人，是机器的主人。可是，过去工人连动一下机器的权利都没有，真是把活人当成了死人，把工人当成了奴隶。”在这里金钱挂帅、物质刺激的流毒更大，仅车箱厂就有什么安全奖、质量奖、季度奖、年中奖、年末奖、酌情奖等二十三种之多。另外还有一种“班组长津贴费”（工人叫操心费），管十人以下的组长，每月“操心费”三元，管二十人以上的组长每月“操心费”四元。在批判会上工人们气愤地说：“这个奖、那个奖，就是没有一点毛泽东思想；这个费、那个费，都是通向资本主义的旅差费。那一小撮走资派就是用这些东西把我们往资本主义道路上拉。”
    通过大揭露、大批判，革委会的同志进一步认识到：不适应社会主义经济基础的规章制度，过去就是这样为一小撮阶级敌人复辟资本主义服务的。现在，如果不彻底摧毁旧的上层建筑，又会成为阶级敌人复辟资本主义的思想基础和组织基础。只有发动广大革命职工清除旧的基础，建立起为社会主义经济基础服务的上层建筑，才能巩固新的革命政权，使工厂的大权真正掌握在工人阶级手里。
    依靠工人群众不断战胜敌人的干扰和破坏，在斗、批、改中开展对敌斗争
    毛主席说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”车箱厂革委会在自己的革命实践中深深地体会到：改革不适应社会主义经济基础的规章制度，绝不是单纯地减少几个人，去掉几个科室，破除几项旧规章制度的问题，而是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。只有依靠工人群众，不断战胜阶级敌人的干扰和破坏，才能搞好斗、批、改。
    精简机构一开始，革委会选定一批新生力量，准备吸收到新的机构中来，一小撮阶级敌人就在背后煽动资产阶级派性，进行破坏。他们说：“这一派人多了，那一派人少了”，“革委会有偏心，决定有错误”。革委会学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，认识到斗争是不可避免的。于是，便发动群众把一个破坏精简机构的坏分子揪了出来，粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。
    一场斗争结束了，新的斗争又开始了。当革委会把科室人员集中起来，办毛泽东思想学习班，深揭旧机构的害处时，敌人又在那里破坏了，说什么：“学习班一办，干部就成了兔子的尾巴——长不了喽。”煽动干部不去参加学习，还散布“要下去都下去”的谬论，给革委会施加压力。革委会和广大革命职工一起认真学习了毛主席关于“这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，……”的教导，认识到：改革就是斗争，一小撮阶级敌人决不会甘心灭亡，只有把对敌斗争进行到底，才能把改革进行到底。革委会就和工人一起，向阶级敌人发起了主动进攻，于是，很快就把一小撮阶级敌人揪出来了。
    车箱厂革委会在斗、批、改中，紧紧依靠工人群众和革命干部，击退了一小撮阶级敌人一次又一次疯狂反扑，彻底粉碎了敌人妄图破坏斗、批、改的罪恶阴谋。在斗争中，他们体会到：旧的规章制度，是面临彻底灭亡的一小撮阶级敌人进行垂死挣扎的一个阵地，也是敌人用来同无产阶级、新生的革命政权作最后顽抗的一个重要堡垒。敌人企图固守这个阵地，用这个阵地进攻新生的革命政权。因此，在改革中，既不能改良，也不能用“和平改造”的方法，只能依靠群众，在阶级斗争中改。只有这样，才能摧毁敌人的阵地，攻克敌人的堡垒，不断夺取新的胜利。
    发动工人群众自觉地斗私批修，彻底完成斗、批、改的历史任务
    在斗、批、改中，车箱厂革委会体会到，要认真搞好斗、批、改，除了不断与阶级敌人的破坏和干扰作斗争，还必须发动和依靠群众同自己头脑中的私心杂念作斗争。只有革好思想上的命，才能革好不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑的命。
    这个革命是从革委会改变旧作风开始的。
    革委会在改变旧作风时，首先遇到的一个问题，是要不要和要个什么样的办公室的问题。有的同志认为，厂子大人员多，过去十几个办公室都没有能把工作做好，现在总还得有个象样的办公室才行。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革委会认真学习了毛主席的指示，认识到：这不单单是个办公室的问题，而是要不要革命、要不要革掉“当官作老爷”的旧作风的问题。接着，就组织大家对“当官作老爷”思想进行批判。老工人王喜勤说：“办公的‘公’就是群众，离开了群众去办公，就是办‘空’。过去的办公室不是办‘公’，而是办‘私’，不是为人民服务，而是‘当官作老爷’，结果越办越私，越办越‘修’。”认识提高了，革委会决定，只留一间房子，既是革委会的工作室，又是学习室。
    在改造旧机构中，发动群众斗私批修，重要的是要依靠工人作好下放科室人员的思想政治工作，不断用毛泽东思想对他们进行再教育。开始，科室人员在留与下的问题上，思想上有很大阻力。有人说：“在上不好干、下去不好看。”原技术科有两个干部，革委会决定留下一个、下去一个。开始，他们思想都不通，下去的感到丢了面子；留下的感到一个人要负担几个人的工作，怕挑不起担子，负不起责任。革委会一边组织他们学习，一边发动工人作他们的思想政治工作。工人们就找这两个干部谈心，一些老工人还给他们忆旧社会的苦，谈新社会的甜，启发他们的阶级觉悟。工人群众的热情帮助，使这两个技术干部受到很大教育和鼓舞。他们带着问题，进一步学习了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，很快解除了顾虑。留下的那个干部工作忙不开，工人就和他一起研究解决，碰到问题帮他出主意，想办法，他工作比过去完成的更好。工人们称赞他“干劲大，真是好样的！”下去的那个干部，跟工人一起劳动，一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起解决生产中的问题。工人们反映：“干部下来的时间虽然不长，但是大大变了样。”他自己也感到：“跟工人在一起，不是丢了什么‘面子’，而是丢掉了资产阶级思想，得到的是无产阶级思想。”通过精简机构的实践，许多干部深有感受地说：“难办、难看，是‘私’字作怪，丢掉了‘私’字，留下的安心，下去的愉快。”
    斗、批、改的群众运动摧毁了旧的上层建筑，巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果
    车箱厂革委会在斗、批、改中，依靠革命工人，用革命大批判摧毁了不适应社会主义经济基础的规章制度，又依靠革命工人用毛泽东思想建设了新的政权机构，建立了新的规章制度，树起了密切联系群众的新作风，进一步巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。他们取消了原来的五个科、三个室，健全和充实了革委会的办事机构，干部由原来的七十七人减少到十八人；废除和革新了许多不合理的规章制度，用政治讲评代替金钱物质奖励，用政治考勤代替了经济考勤，用群众管理代替了“专家治厂”，组成了由工人、革命技术人员、革命干部参加的三结合技术管理小组，设立了群众设计室，从根本上跳出了旧机构、旧规章制度的圈子。
    革委会人员在群众中办公，首先抓阶级斗争。加工工段的大批判过去一直搞得比较差，走资派就乘机大搞翻案。革委会主任王荣高到这个工段以后，和工人一起学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人的翻案妖风，使革命大批判越来越深入。
    革委会人员深入基层以后，使一些长期得不到解决的问题，迅速得到了解决。生产车箱用的木料，过去由于受旧规章制度约束，造成了运、管、用脱节。因木材不能及时转运入库，长期积压在装卸线上，影响了铁路运输，生产得不到及时供应，成批木料因雨淋日晒变形报废。建厂以来，工人曾多次提出意见，一直没有解决，被称为“老大难”问题。革委会生产组人员下到车间和工人一起劳动，一起研究，打破了旧规章制度的约束，实行了运、管、用的统一调度，很快解决了问题。
    思想革命有力地推动了技术革命。革委会的同志、下放的科室干部、技术人员，和工人一起斗私批修、一起劳动，大大加速了思想革命化，有力地推动了技术革命。木材堆垛机械化设备，过去被走资派封为技术“权威”的，搞了五年多都没搞成，安装的部分项目也根本不能使用，干部、技术人员和工人一结合，仅用了三十二个小时，就把其中一项单轨吊车改革成功，由人工搬运变成机械作业，提高搬运效率十倍。“三结合”的技术革新队伍，不但改革了旧的技术设备，还试制成功了我国第一台适用于各种电焊机的变压器。这种变压器的重量和体积，只相当于同样容量旧变压器的百分之三十，达到了世界最先进的技术水平。这些活生生的事实，对大家教育很深。
    目前，车箱厂的革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，斗、批、改的群众运动正在向纵深发展，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动更加广泛深入，广大职工的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。革命带动了生产，车箱生产日日上升，创造了建厂以来班产的最高纪录。
