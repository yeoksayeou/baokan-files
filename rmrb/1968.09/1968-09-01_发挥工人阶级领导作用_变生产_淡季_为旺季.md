The Fufeng Mining Bureau, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, has fully utilized the leadership of the working class, taken class struggle as the key link, and used the revolutionary criticism as the driving force. They have smashed the fallacy of the so-called "off-season" for coal production in the third quarter fabricated by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, and have insisted on combining revolution with production. They have turned the so-called "off-season" into a peak season, achieving stable and high coal production.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party of the Fufeng Mining Bureau vehemently opposed the prominence of proletarian politics and denied the revolutionary enthusiasm and subjective initiative of the working masses in transforming the world. This small clique of capitalist roaders, driven by their hostile nature towards socialist production and construction and their bourgeois desire for ease, used excuses such as "the third quarter has more rain and hot weather" to designate the third quarter as the "off-season" for the mine's production. They used their usurped power to lower targets, maintain a passive balance between mining and tunneling, making production sluggish and slack, and reducing coal output. At that time, the workers were very dissatisfied with this, saying: "Off-season, off-season, it's the leaders' idea. The leaders save effort and energy, harm the country, and fatten themselves. No one cares about production, and the workers are anxious."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has profoundly changed people's spiritual outlook. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Fufeng Mining Bureau, the working class took control of the leadership of the coal mine, making the revolutionary enthusiasm surge and production records continuously broken. Since entering the third quarter, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers have decided to break the old rules and raise the original coal output in the third quarter. The workers pointed out: The months of July, August, and September have more difficult objective conditions. In the past, the capitalist roaders used this to label this period as the production "off-season," lowering targets and obstructing the development of production. This is one of their evil activities to sabotage socialist production and construction. Now that we are in power, we must not follow old practices. We must grasp class struggle, overcome objective difficulties, and promote coal production. The Revolutionary Committee, based on the demands of the working masses, formulated the production plan for the third quarter, with production targets higher than those of the first and second quarters.

Relying on the broad masses of workers, the Revolutionary Committee, in conjunction with the criticism of the revisionist fallacies of "expert management" and "technology first" advocated by Liu Shaoqi (referred to as "Chinese Khrushchev"), exposed, criticized, and struggled against the fallacy of the "off-season" for production fabricated by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. The more they criticized, the brighter their minds became, the more confident they were in doing a good job in production, and the greater their enthusiasm. Many workers' teams took oaths in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their determination; workshops, mines, dormitories, and offices were all covered with workers' guarantee letters for combining revolution with production. A new high tide of combining revolution with production quickly swept across the entire bureau.

Facing the revolutionary actions of the broad revolutionary cadres and workers to turn the production "off-season" into a peak season, a small clique of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the party of the Fufeng Mining Bureau hated it to death and feared it to death. They either spread strange theories to mislead people or conspired to create accidents to sabotage production. In response to this situation, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses of workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." "We must not be naive and simplify the complex class struggle." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, extensively discussed the new characteristics of class struggle and the new trends of class enemies. Many old workers resolutely stated: We must not let the enemies' conspiracies succeed. We will smash the last struggle of a small clique of class enemies with remarkable achievements in combining revolution with production! They fought a head-on struggle with the class enemies, striking a heavy blow against the class enemies. The broad masses of workers, with everything revolving around revolution, from the overall situation, insisted on combining revolution with production, fully demonstrating the noble quality of the working class of being selfless and public-spirited, and showing the working class's role as the main force in the Cultural Revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of history's progress." The broad revolutionary cadres and workers have grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, further raising their proletarian political awareness and greatly promoting communist cooperative spirit. Many workers worked full shifts, speeding up tunneling and coal mining, thus achieving stable and high production. The original coal production of the entire mining bureau, on the basis of completing the national plan for the first half of the year seven days ahead of schedule, completed the production task four days ahead of schedule in July. Since August, the average daily output has exceeded the planned target by 12%, an increase of 9% over the actual daily output of the first half of the year, and an increase of 32% over the daily output of the same period before the Cultural Revolution. The so-called "off-season" for coal production by the capitalist roaders has been turned into a peak season by the workers.

    发挥工人阶级领导作用　变生产“淡季”为旺季
    峰峰矿务局以革命大批判为动力，粉碎党内一小撮走资派制造的所谓第三季度是煤炭生产“淡季”的谬论，坚持抓革命促生产，实现了煤炭稳产高产
    据新华社石家庄二十九日电峰峰矿务局革命委员会在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，以阶级斗争为纲，以革命大批判为动力，粉碎了本矿党内一小撮走资派制造的第三季度是煤炭生产“淡季”的谬论，坚持抓革命、促生产，把所谓“淡季”变成了旺季，煤炭生产实现了稳产高产。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，峰峰矿务局党内一小撮走资派，竭力反对突出无产阶级政治，否定工人群众的革命积极性和改造世界的主观能动作用。这一小撮走资派从他们敌视社会主义生产建设和贪图安逸的资产阶级本性出发，借口什么“三季度雨水多，天气热”等等，把三季度规定为本矿生产的“淡季”。他们利用窃踞的职权，降低指标，搞采、掘消极平衡，使生产冷冷落落，松松垮垮，煤炭产量下降。那时，工人们就对此非常不满，工人们说：“淡季淡季，矿上‘领导’的主意，‘领导’省心又省力，害了国家，养胖了自己，生产没人问，工人干着急。”
    无产阶级文化大革命深刻地改变着人的精神面貌。峰峰矿务局革命委员会成立以后，工人阶级自己掌握了煤矿的领导权，使革命热潮蒸蒸日上，生产纪录不断刷新。进入三季度以来，广大革命职工决心打破陈规陋习，把三季度的原煤产量突上去。工人们指出：七、八、九三个月，客观条件是困难一些，过去走资派利用这一点，把这个时期说成是生产“淡季”，压低指标，阻挠生产的发展，这是他们破坏社会主义生产建设的一项罪恶活动。现在我们自己掌了权，决不能因循守旧，要狠抓阶级斗争，克服客观困难，把煤炭生产促上去。革委会根据工人群众的要求，制定了第三季度的生产计划，产量指标比第一季度和第二季度都有提高。
    革委会依靠广大工人，结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义谬论，对峰峰矿务局党内一小撮走资派制造的生产“淡季”论进行了大揭露，大批判，大斗争。大家越批心里越亮，搞好生产的信心越足，干劲越大。不少班组的工人在毛主席像前集体宣誓，表示了决心；车间、矿井、宿舍、科室，都贴满了工人们抓革命、促生产的保证书。一场抓革命、促生产的新高潮，很快在全局轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    对于广大革命职工变生产“淡季”为旺季的革命行动，峰峰矿务局党内一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，恨得要死，怕得要命。他们或者散布奇谈怪论，妄图蛊惑人心；或者阴谋制造事故，破坏生产。针对这种情况，革委会成员和广大工人反复学习了毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，大摆阶级斗争的新特点，大议阶级敌人的新动向。许多老工人坚决地表示：决不能让阶级敌人的阴谋得逞，我们要以抓革命、促生产的显著成果，粉碎一小撮阶级敌人的垂死挣扎！他们同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人。广大工人群众一切以革命为怀，从全局出发，坚持抓革命、促生产，充分表现出工人阶级一心为公的高贵品质，显示了工人阶级在文化大革命中的主力军作用。
    林副主席指示说：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，无产阶级政治觉悟进一步提高，共产主义协作精神大大发扬，许多工人出满勤，加快掘进和采煤进度，结果实现了稳产高产。全矿务局的原煤生产在提前七天完成上半年国家计划的基础上，七月份又提前四天完成了生产任务。八月份以来，平均日产量超额百分之十二完成计划指标，比上半年实际日产量提高了百分之九，比文化大革命以前同时期的日产量增长百分之三十二。走资派所谓的煤炭生产“淡季”，工人们把它变成了生产旺季。
