	Japanese University Students Stage Massive Protest Against Sato Government's Fascist Suppression

	New Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: According to the Oriental News Agency, approximately 8,000 students from Nihon University in Tokyo held a massive rally and demonstration this afternoon, protesting against the fascist suppression of students by the reactionary Sato government.

	Today's rally was the largest since the university began its struggle.

	Student representatives who spoke at the rally unanimously protested against the Sato reactionary government's fascist suppression of students and further expressed their determination to fight to the end for the reform of the educational system, for students to manage the school themselves, and to smash the reactionary and rotten educational system.

	After the rally, the students, wearing helmets and armed with sticks and bamboo spears, marched onto the streets with high spirits, holding a demonstration. Students from other universities, workers, and citizens who supported the just struggle of Nihon University students also joined the demonstration, bringing the total number of demonstrators to about 20,000.

	The Sato reactionary government dispatched 2,000 armed police to brutally suppress the students. The police beat the demonstrating students with batons, forcing the students to pick up stones from the ground to fight back. After driving back the police, the students continued their demonstration and once again occupied the buildings of the Economics Department and the Law Department, and controlled the streets around the school.

	The students continued their struggle until late at night.

	New Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: According to the Oriental News Agency, Japanese national railway workers today held strikes lasting from three hours to twelve hours in Nagoya, Miihara, and Nishimiazaki, among 33 locations, protesting against the national railway authorities' so-called "modernization" plan that involves laying off a large number of railway workers.

	According to the national railway authorities' so-called "modernization" plan, 50,000 railway workers are to be laid off, and railway workers will face even more brutal exploitation.

	Due to the strike by national railway workers, railway transportation across Japan was in chaos today, with over 500 cargo and passenger trains forced to stop.

	In Nagoya, about 500 railway workers sat on the train platform, preventing the railway authorities from allowing scab workers to operate the trains. Despite the railway authorities dispatching a large number of police and railway security personnel to suppress the striking workers, the workers continued their struggle, shouting slogans such as "Oppose 'modernization'!" and "Police, go back!"

    新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道，东京日本大学约八千名学生，今天下午再次举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，反对佐藤反动政府对学生实行法西斯镇压。
    今天举行的集会，是这所大学开展斗争以来规模最大的一次。
    在会上发言的学生代表，一致抗议佐藤反动政府对学生实行法西斯镇压，进一步表示了他们决心为实现学制改革，由学生自己管理学校，粉碎反动腐朽的学制而斗争到底的决心。
    会后，学生们头戴钢盔，手持棍棒和竹矛，斗志昂扬地走上街头，举行示威游行。一些支持日本大学学生的正义斗争的其他大学的学生、工人和市民也参加了示威游行，使示威游行的人数达到大约两万人。
    佐藤反动政府出动了两千名武装警察，对学生进行野蛮镇压。警察用警棍毒打示威的学生，迫使学生们也拣起地上的石块，向警察反击。示威学生在击退了警察以后，又继续举行示威游行，并且再次占领了经济学部和法律学部大楼，并且控制了学校周围的街道。
    学生们一直坚持斗争到深夜。
    新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本国营铁路工人今天在名古屋、米原和西舞鹤等三十三个地方举行三小时到十二小时的罢工，反对国营铁路当局在推行所谓“现代化”计划中，大批解雇铁路工人。
    根据国营铁路当局推行的所谓“现代化”计划，有五万名铁路工人要被解雇，铁路工人将受到更残酷的剥削。
    由于国营铁路工人罢工，日本全国国营铁路运输今天呈现出一片混乱，共有五百多辆货车和客车被迫停驶。
    在名古屋，约有五百名铁路工人坐在火车站台上，阻止铁路当局让工贼开车。尽管铁路当局出动了大批警察和铁路治安官员镇压罢工工人，但是工人们仍旧坚持斗争，他们高呼“反对‘现代化’！”“警察滚回去！”等口号。
