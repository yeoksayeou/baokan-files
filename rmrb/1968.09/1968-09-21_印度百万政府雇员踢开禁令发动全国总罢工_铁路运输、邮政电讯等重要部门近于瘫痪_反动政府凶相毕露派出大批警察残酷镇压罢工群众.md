	Indian government employees in millions defied the ban imposed by the Indian reactionary government and launched a nationwide general strike on the morning of the 19th.

	According to reports, by 10 a.m. on the 19th, in major cities such as New Delhi and Bombay, as well as in states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Assam, and Kerala, several million government employees and workers had joined the strike, bringing India's railway transportation, postal and telecommunications, and other important government departments to the brink of paralysis.

	The Indian reactionary government carried out brutal and savage fascist suppression against the striking masses. According to reports, in the Indian capital of New Delhi, fully armed reactionary police blocked off the city's main streets and set up sentry posts outside government department buildings. When the striking masses held demonstrations outside some government departments, the police beat the demonstrators with batons and threw tear gas into the crowd.

	In Assam, railway traffic had completely stopped, and postal and telecommunications links had been severed. According to reports, when several thousand striking workers and their wives and children gathered along the railway tracks, the reactionary police even did not spare women and children, savagely throwing tear gas and beating them.

	The Indian reactionary government hates and fears this unprecedented nationwide strike to the core. Its fascist suppression began on the 18th. According to reports, after Indian reactionary government leader Indira Gandhi held an emergency cabinet meeting on the 18th, armed police surrounded the building where the strike committee was located and arrested some strike leaders. In major cities like New Delhi and Bombay, mass arrests began in the evening of the 18th, with large numbers of workers being illegally detained.

	Currently, the strike wave of Indian government employees and workers is continuing to develop. The fascist suppression by the Indian reactionary government can only expose its weakness and can only arouse even stronger resistance from the Indian people against the Indian reactionary government, which is in a dire situation both domestically and internationally.

    印度百万政府雇员踢开禁令发动全国总罢工
    铁路运输、邮政电讯等重要部门近于瘫痪
    反动政府凶相毕露派出大批警察残酷镇压罢工群众
    新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：印度全国各地政府雇员不顾印度反动政府的法西斯禁令，在十九日清晨开始全国性总罢工。
    据报道，到十九日上午十时，在新德里、孟买等印度一些主要城市以及北方、西孟加拉、旁遮普、拉贾斯坦、阿萨姆和喀拉拉等邦的其他地方，已经有好几百万政府雇员和工人参加了罢工斗争，使印度的铁路运输、邮政电讯等重要政府部门几乎处于瘫痪。
    印度反动政府对罢工群众进行了残酷野蛮的法西斯镇压。据报道，在印度首都新德里，反动警察全副武装，封锁了全市的主要街道，在政府各部门的办公楼外布满岗哨。当罢工群众在一些政府部门外面举行示威游行时，警察用警棍殴打示威者，并向人群投掷催泪弹。
    在阿萨姆邦，铁路交通已经完全停顿，邮政电讯联系也已中断。据报道，当好几千名罢工群众以及他们的妻子儿女聚集在铁路两旁时，反动警察竟连妇女和儿童也不放过，残暴地投掷催泪弹和殴打他们。
    印度反动政府对于这次空前规模的全国性罢工恨得要死，怕得要命，它的法西斯镇压暴行在十八日已经开始了。据报道，印度反动政府头子英迪拉·甘地在十八日召开紧急内阁会议后，大批武装警察就包围了罢工委员会所在的大楼，逮捕了一些罢工领导人。在新德里、孟买等一些大城市，从十八日晚上就开始了大规模的逮捕活动，大批工人被非法逮捕。
    目前，印度政府雇员和工人的罢工怒潮正在继续发展中。印度反动政府的法西斯镇压，只能暴露它的虚弱，只能激起印度人民对内外交困的印度反动政府的更加强烈的反抗。
