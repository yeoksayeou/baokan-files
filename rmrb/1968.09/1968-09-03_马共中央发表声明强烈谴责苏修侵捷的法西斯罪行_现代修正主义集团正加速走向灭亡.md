The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party issued a statement on August 24 strongly condemning the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Malayan Communist Party strongly condemns the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys in armed occupation of Czechoslovakia.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys, the Gomulka clique, the Ulbricht clique, the Kadar clique, and the Zhivkov clique, have carried out a military occupation of Czechoslovakia, following in the footsteps of the Hitler gang's invasion of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s. This is a full exposure of the fascist-imperialist nature of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and a full exposure of its paper tiger essence.

The modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is disintegrating, with internal contradictions becoming increasingly acute. In order to maintain its shaky hegemonic position, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in a desperate move, has launched an armed invasion. This marks the complete bankruptcy of Soviet modern revisionism and the accelerating demise of the modern revisionist clique.

The events in Czechoslovakia once again prove that the Czechoslovak revisionist ruling clique—the Novotny clique and the Dubcek clique—are nothing but labor traitors and national traitors. It is they who have long been practicing bourgeois dictatorship, and it is the Dubcek clique that, in the face of armed invasion, adopted a policy of surrender, leaving the Czechoslovak people completely unprepared for the sudden attack, thus allowing the invaders to easily and quickly occupy the entire country.

The events in Czechoslovakia once again show that the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are tightening their collusion in an attempt to redivide the world. They have contradictions in their struggle for spheres of influence, but they are united in their counter-revolutionary goals. They are birds of a feather. Therefore, to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. Only by firmly opposing the Soviet revisionists can the struggle against U.S. imperialism be carried through to the end.

The Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan people firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak people against the occupying army and the domestic revisionist traitor clique. The Malayan Communist Party is convinced that, under the invincible guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and with the powerful impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Czechoslovak people will certainly overthrow the reactionary rule of domestic and foreign revisionism, re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and advance along the socialist road.

    马共中央发表声明强烈谴责苏修侵捷的法西斯罪行
    现代修正主义集团正加速走向灭亡
    美苏加紧勾结妄图重新瓜分世界  世界人民只有坚决反对苏修，才能把反美斗争进行到底
    新华社二日讯　马来亚共产党中央委员会八月二十四日发表声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行。声明全文如下：
    马来亚共产党强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团及其仆从武装占领捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行。
    苏修叛徒集团及其仆从哥穆尔卡集团、乌布利希集团、卡达尔集团、日夫科夫集团对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领，走上了三十年代希特勒匪帮侵略捷克斯洛伐克的老路。这是苏修叛徒集团法西斯——帝国主义面目的大暴露，是它的纸老虎本质的大暴露。
    以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义集团正分崩离析，内部矛盾日益加剧。苏修叛徒集团为了维持其摇摇欲坠的霸权地位，狗急跳墙，悍然发动了武装侵略。这标志着苏联现代修正主义的彻底破产，标志着现代修正主义集团的加速走向灭亡。
    捷克斯洛伐克的事件再一次证明，捷修统治集团——诺沃提尼集团和杜布切克集团，都是不折不扣的工贼和民族叛徒。正是它们长期实行资产阶级专政，正是杜布切克集团在武装侵略面前采取投降政策，使捷克斯洛伐克人民对突然袭击毫无准备，从而使侵略者轻而易举地迅速占领整个捷克斯洛伐克。
    捷克斯洛伐克的事件再一次表明，美帝和苏修正在加紧勾结妄图重新瓜分世界。它们在争夺势力范围方面有矛盾，但在反革命方面却是一致的。它们是一丘之貉。因此，反帝必须反修。只有坚决反对苏修，才能把反对美帝的斗争进行到底。
    马来亚共产党人和马来亚人民坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反对占领军以及本国修正主义叛徒集团的革命斗争。马来亚共产党坚信，在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的有力推动下，捷克斯洛伐克人民必将推翻国内外修正主义的反动统治，重建无产阶级专政，沿着社会主义的道路前进。
