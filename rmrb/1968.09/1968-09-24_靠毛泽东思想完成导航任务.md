	Completing combat missions successfully—what is it based on? Is it based on politics or technology? This is a fundamental difference between two classes and two military lines.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Our army relies on emphasizing proletarian politics and on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought to complete combat missions and achieve victory. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai blathers on about how technology is the "real skill," the "hard work," the "most powerful thing." In short, military technology is the greatest combat power. Pfft! This is utterly reactionary and absurd! Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's garbage is picked from the trash heap of "technology decides everything" from the Chinese Khrushchev, which is the purely military viewpoint that Chairman Mao criticized more than thirty years ago.

	In the past, our navigation station also had comrades who thought that navigation was a complex task. As long as there was technology, the mission could be successfully completed. Under this guiding ideology, we were busy with our work all day. To break through technical difficulties, we practiced diligently from morning to night, memorizing everything by rote. Some soldiers even lay in bed at night, drawing route maps on their stomachs. Although the parts, numbers, and functions were memorized perfectly, and the spider-web-like route maps could be drawn quickly, some comrades even reached the level of "first-class technical expert." However, due to the weakening of political and ideological work, accidents kept happening. As some comrades said: "The route maps are familiar, but people's minds are rusty. Technology has improved, but Mao Zedong Thought has decreased in people's minds. If politics does not lead, the direction will definitely be wrong, and problems will arise."

	The harsh facts taught us that emphasizing politics is the core of Chairman Mao's military thought, the fundamental guarantee for our army to always be invincible and to always maintain the red color of the people's army. From then on, we put emphasizing politics and vigorously promoting the ideological revolution of people in the first place, making the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything the fundamental principle of navigation work. As a result, our station has become a station of five-good soldiers, continuously evaluated as a four-good station for seven years, and praised as the "Red Navigation Station."

	Once, a new soldier who had been in the army for less than two months was on duty alone. Suddenly, the weather changed drastically, and clouds covered the airport. The pilot urgently needed the navigation station to guide the plane through the clouds for landing. However, at this critical moment, the navigation equipment malfunctioned. Unfortunately, the station commander was at a meeting, and all the old soldiers were out on a mission. Time was tight, and the plane was making emergency calls in the air. What to do? The new soldier looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait on the opposite wall. Instantly, he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our responsibility is to the people." He seemed to see Chairman Mao commanding him in battle, and his body was filled with boundless strength. He calmly analyzed the cause and quickly and accurately eliminated the malfunction, ensuring the plane's safe landing.

	Living facts tell us: Mao Zedong Thought is the most precise navigation station. With Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, we are clear-minded and never lost. Emphasizing proletarian politics and mastering Mao Zedong Thought can overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and successfully complete all combat missions given to us by Chairman Mao. On the contrary, if we follow Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line and focus solely on mastering technology, we will lose everything and fail in everything. The ambitious Peng Dehuai shouts about "technology first" precisely to try to remove our soul—Mao Zedong Thought—and turn our army into a bourgeois army to complete his task of restoring capitalism. We must raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash all of Peng Dehuai's plots, and forever walk the path of emphasizing politics, forever relying on Mao Zedong Thought to successfully complete navigation tasks.

### 靠毛泽东思想完成导航任务

    靠毛泽东思想完成导航任务
    空军某部台长  姚民
    圆满地完成战斗任务靠什么？是靠政治还是靠技术？这是两个阶级、两条建军路线的一个根本分歧。
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”我军就是靠突出无产阶级政治，就是靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，去完成战斗任务，夺取胜利的。可是，反革命修正主义分子彭德怀却胡说什么技术是“真本事”、“硬功夫”，是“最厉害的东西”。一句话，军事技术是最大的战斗力。呸！这真是反动透顶，荒谬绝伦！彭德怀和罗瑞卿的这套黑货，是从中国赫鲁晓夫技术“决定一切”的垃圾堆里拾来的破烂，是毛主席早在三十多年前就批判过的单纯军事观点。
    过去，我们导航台一度也有同志认为，导航是一项复杂的工作，只要有了技术，就能圆满地完成任务。在这种思想指导下，整天忙于业务。为了突破技术难关，从早到晚苦练本领，死记硬背。甚至有的战士晚上躺在被窝里，还在肚皮上默划线路图。尽管机件、号码、作用背得滚瓜烂熟，密如蛛网一样的线路图也能很快默画出来，有的同志还达到了“一级技术能手”的水平。可是，由于政治思想工作大大削弱，责任事故也就连续地发生。正如有的同志说：“线路图画熟了，人的思想生锈了，技术提高了，人的头脑里毛泽东思想减少了。政治不领先，方向一定偏，问题就冒尖。”
    严酷的事实教育了我们，突出政治是毛主席建军思想的核心，是使我军永远立于不败之地，永远保持人民军队鲜红颜色的根本保证。从此，我们把突出政治，狠抓人的思想革命化放到第一位，把用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，推动一切，改造一切当作导航工作的根本。结果，我们台个个成为五好战士，连续七年被评为四好台，被誉为“红色导航台”。
    一次，一位入伍不到两个月的新战士单独值班。突然，天气急骤变化，乌云遮盖了机场。飞行员急需导航台引导，穿云着陆。可是，就在这个节骨眼上，导航机发生了故障。偏偏不凑巧，台长开会去了，老战士又全部外出执行任务。时间紧迫，飞机在空中连续紧急呼叫。怎么办？新战士抬头看见了对面墙上的毛主席像，顿时想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”他仿佛看到毛主席就在指挥他战斗，浑身增加了无穷力量。他沉着地分析原因，迅速准确地排除了故障，保证了飞机安全着陆。
    活生生的事实告诉我们：毛泽东思想是最最精确的导航台。有了毛泽东思想作指导，我们心明眼亮，永不迷航。突出无产阶级政治，掌握了毛泽东思想，就能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，胜利完成毛主席交给我们的一切战斗任务。相反，照彭德怀那一套资产阶级军事路线去搞，单纯地搞什么熟练的技术，我们就要丢掉一切，就要丧失一切。大野心家彭德怀之所以声嘶力竭地鼓吹“技术第一”，就是妄图抽掉我们的灵魂——毛泽东思想，把我军变成资产阶级的军队，完成他复辟资本主义的“任务”。我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底粉碎彭德怀的一切阴谋，永远走突出政治的路，永远靠毛泽东思想圆满地完成导航任务。
