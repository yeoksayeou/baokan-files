Japanese coal mine owners, in their relentless pursuit of profits, have shown utter disregard for the lives of their workers, forcing them to toil under deplorable conditions. This has led to a continuous series of accidents, resulting in a high number of worker fatalities. According to figures released by the Japanese government, 153 miners have already lost their lives in mining accidents in the first half of this year alone. Recently, a coal mine owned by the "Hokkaido Coal Mining and Shipping Company" caught fire, claiming the lives of 31 miners. Following the incident, the families of the deceased workers and the broader mining community expressed their outrage, shouting, "The capitalists have murdered our brothers for profit!" and have taken up the fight against the capitalists.

    日本煤矿事故不断工人惨遭伤亡
    日本煤矿资本家为了榨取大量利润，不顾工人死活，强迫矿工在恶劣的条件下工作，造成不断的工伤事故，使矿工大量死亡。据日本政府公布的数字，今年上半年，由于煤矿失事，已有一百五十三名矿工死亡。最近，日本“北海道炭矿汽船”所属煤矿，在去年四月发生严重事故之后，又有一个煤矿着火，使三十一名煤矿工人烧死。事后工人家属和广大煤矿工人愤怒高呼：
  “资本家为了赚钱谋害了我们的兄弟”，并向资本家进行斗争。
