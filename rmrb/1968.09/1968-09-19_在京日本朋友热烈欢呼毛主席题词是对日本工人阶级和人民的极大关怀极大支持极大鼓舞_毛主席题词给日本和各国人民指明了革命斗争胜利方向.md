Japanese friends in Beijing enthusiastically hail Chairman Mao's inscription as a great concern, support, and encouragement for the Japanese working class and people. Chairman Mao's inscription points the way to victory in the revolutionary struggle for the Japanese and all peoples.

New China News Agency, September 18 — "As long as we earnestly achieve the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt." Six years ago, Chairman Mao gave this important inscription to Japanese worker friends. Some Japanese friends currently in Beijing spoke to a New China News Agency reporter, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao's inscription as pointing the way to victory in the revolutionary struggle for the Japanese people and all peoples.

Japanese friends who saw the inscription published in the newspapers felt very close to it. They said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the Chinese people and also the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world." "Chairman Mao's inscription is a great concern, support, and encouragement for the Japanese working class and the broad revolutionary people of Japan." They pointed out that the inscription has extremely profound significance for the Japanese revolution and the world revolution. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people and all peoples will advance and achieve final victory.

Kamata Norio said that Chairman Mao's important inscription once again points the way for the Japanese revolutionary left and the Japanese revolutionary people. He emphasized the importance of establishing a Marxist-Leninist party in Japan. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'If you want revolution, you must have a revolutionary party.' To better conduct the revolution, we must learn the style of the Chinese Communist Party in combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and practicing self-criticism. We must use the 'arrow' of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the 'target' of Japanese revolutionary practice." He pointed out that the current vigorous development of the workers' movement and the patriotic student movement in Japan is the result of the Japanese revolutionary people fighting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Kamata Norio said, "Chairman Mao said, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' 'The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is always correct.' We must adhere to these Marxist-Leninist principles. Whether or not we adhere to these principles is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists."

Takano Hiroshi said that Chairman Mao's inscription is a guiding document for the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle, and it is very important guidance for the current Japanese revolution and for the future socialist revolution in Japan. We must strive to study Chairman Mao's inscription and Chairman Mao's series of teachings. As long as we conduct revolutionary practice according to Chairman Mao's teachings, the Japanese revolution will definitely make rapid progress.

Takano Hiroshi said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution.' Chairman Mao repeatedly points out that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of all peoples in the world. The Japanese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have fought resolutely against American imperialism, this most vicious enemy. On the contrary, the Miyamoto revisionist clique not only avoids the anti-American struggle but also suppresses the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle.

He said, "In his essay 'Problems of War and Strategy,' Chairman Mao teaches us, 'The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun.' Yet, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and the Miyamoto revisionist clique advocate 'peaceful revolution.' This shows that they are most afraid of Chairman Mao's teachings because violent revolution is the truth of Marxism-Leninism. We must widely propagate Chairman Mao's people's war thought among the Japanese people and arm the minds of the Japanese people with the thought of people's war."

Yoshida Koichi, in his speech, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao for his brilliant and comprehensive development of Marxism-Leninism and hailed the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, which has spread Mao Zedong Thought widely among revolutionary people around the world. He said, one of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' Historically, all revisionists have strongly opposed violent revolution, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique is no exception. He stressed that the Japanese revolutionary people must thoroughly criticize the Miyamoto revisionist clique, and only in this way can the Japanese revolution be advanced.

Yoshida Koichi said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'If we have the correct theory but only talk about it and do not put it into practice, then no matter how good the theory is, it is meaningless.' We must defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and we must combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution."

Kawagoe Toshitaka said, after reading Chairman Mao's inscription, I deeply felt the importance of the words 'as long as we earnestly achieve.' Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In the world, the most feared are the words 'seriousness.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'seriousness.' To achieve victory in the Japanese revolution, we must earnestly combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution. He condemned the Miyamoto revisionist clique for using the excuse of Japan's special circumstances to negate the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism. He said, 'Without destruction, there can be no construction. We must thoroughly criticize the Miyamoto revisionist clique.

Kawagoe Toshitaka said, Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that the true Marxist-Leninists in Japan will definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combine Mao Zedong Thought with Japanese revolutionary practice, and definitely be able to engage in revolutionary struggle, combine with the revolutionary masses, and seize victory in the Japanese revolution.

Okabe Keiji said, the world has entered the new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggle around the world is thriving. In Japan, the trend of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedented, and more and more people have already realized: only by seizing power through armed struggle, only by overthrowing the bourgeois regime by force, can the proletariat be liberated.

He said, Chairman Mao's inscription has greatly encouraged the Japanese people and the Japanese working class, who are in the midst of struggle, and is a great proletarian internationalist aid to the Japanese working class. Chairman Mao's inscription is my great goal for future activities. I will definitely keep it in mind and earnestly implement it in revolutionary practice.

Kamata Kiyoshi said, Chairman Mao's inscription will definitely promote a new situation in the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. The inscription has dealt a fatal blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist clique, and has greatly encouraged and supported the people.

She said, the Miyamoto revisionist clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and sabotaged the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. We must definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and definitely combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution. As long as we earnestly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, we will definitely achieve revolutionary victory.

Tetada Tatsu said, when I heard Chairman Mao's inscription on the radio, I was very moved and grateful to Chairman Mao for his support. She said, the Miyamoto revisionist clique is afraid of the revolutionary spirit of the Japanese people and the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. They take the so-called 'parliamentary road' and try to deceive the Japanese people with it, but the Japanese people have exposed their tricks. She said, Chairman Mao's inscription not only has great significance for the Japanese people but also for the revolutionary people of all countries in the world. I will definitely use every opportunity to propagate Chairman Mao's important inscription to the Japanese people.

    在京日本朋友热烈欢呼毛主席题词是对日本工人阶级和人民的极大关怀极大支持极大鼓舞
    毛主席题词给日本和各国人民指明了革命斗争胜利方向
    日本朋友发表谈话指出：世界已进入毛泽东思想的新时代，在日本，活学活用毛泽东思想的盛况空前，越来越多的人认识到，只有武装夺取政权，无产阶级才能得到解放。毛主席的题词是日本人民进行革命斗争的纲领性文件。题词给了美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团致命的打击。日本革命人民一定要对宫本修正主义集团进行彻底批判。日本真正的马克思列宁主义者一定会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想与日本革命实践相结合，与革命群众相结合，夺取日本革命的胜利。
    新华社十八日讯　“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”毛主席六年前给日本工人朋友这一重要题词发表以后，正在北京的一些日本朋友向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席的题词给日本人民和各国人民指明了革命斗争胜利的方向。
    日本朋友们看到报上发表的毛主席的题词，感到十分亲切。他们说，“毛主席是中国人民的伟大导师，也是世界革命人民的伟大导师”，“毛主席的题词是对日本工人阶级和日本广大革命人民的极大关怀，极大支持和极大鼓舞”。他们指出，题词对于日本革命和世界革命，有着极其深远的意义，只要按照毛主席的教导去做，日本人民和各国人民的革命斗争就会推向前进，取得最后胜利。
    镰田修昌说，毛主席的重要题词，又一次给日本革命左派和日本革命人民指明了斗争的方向。他强调在日本建立一个马克思列宁主义党的重要性。他说，毛主席教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。”为了更好地进行革命，我们必须学习中国共产党的理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风，必须用毛泽东思想的“矢”，去射日本革命实际的“的”。他指出，当前日本工人运动和爱国学生运动的蓬勃发展，就是日本革命人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗进行斗争的结果。
    镰田修昌说，毛主席说的“枪杆子里面出政权”、
  “革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。我们必须坚持这些马克思列宁主义的原则。坚持不坚持这些原则，是区分马克思列宁主义者还是修正主义者的分水岭。
    高野广海说，毛主席的题词是日本人民进行革命斗争的纲领性文件，它对当前日本革命和对将来日本社会主义革命都是很重要的教导。我们要努力学习毛主席的题词和毛主席的一系列教导，只要我们按照毛主席的教导去进行革命实践，日本的革命一定会取得迅速的进展。
    高野广海说，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛主席一再指出美帝国主义是全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。日本人民按照毛主席的教导，同美帝国主义这个最凶恶的敌人进行了坚决的斗争。与此相反，宫本修正主义集团不仅逃避反美斗争，而且压制日本人民的反美爱国斗争。
    他说，毛主席在《战争和战略问题》一文中教导我们，“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主”。可是，苏联修正主义领导集团和宫本修正主义集团却鼓吹什么“和平革命”。这说明它们最害怕毛主席的教导，因为暴力革命是马克思列宁主义的真理。我们就是要在日本人民中间广泛宣传毛主席的人民战争思想，要用人民战争思想来武装日本人民的头脑。
    吉田浩一在谈话中热烈称颂毛主席天才地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，欢呼伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命使毛泽东思想在全世界革命人民中得到了广泛的传播。他说，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理之一，就是“枪杆子里面出政权”。历来的修正主义者都是极力反对暴力革命的，宫本修正主义集团也不例外。他强调指出，日本革命人民一定要对宫本修正主义集团进行彻底批判，只有这样才能推进日本革命。
    吉田浩一说，毛主席教导我们：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”我们必须保卫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，必须使马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合。
    川越敏孝说，读了毛主席的题词，我深深感到毛主席说的“只要认真做到”这几个字的重要性。毛主席教导我们：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”要取得日本革命的胜利，就必须认真地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践结合起来。他谴责宫本修正主义集团以日本情况特殊为借口来否定马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。他说，不破不立，对于宫本修正主义集团必须进行彻底的大批判。
    川越敏孝说，毛主席天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想阶段。他指出，日本的真正的马克思列宁主义者一定会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想与日本革命实践相结合，一定能够投入到革命斗争中去，与革命群众相结合，去夺取日本革命的胜利。
    冈部庆治说，世界已进入毛泽东思想的新时代。在毛泽东思想阳光的照耀下，世界革命斗争蓬勃发展。在日本，活学活用毛泽东思想的盛况空前未有，越来越多的人已经认识到：只有用武装斗争夺取政权，只有用暴力推翻资产阶级政权，无产阶级才能得到解放。
    他说，毛主席的题词，给了斗争中的日本人民和作为领导阶级的日本工人阶级极大的鼓舞，是给予日本工人阶级的巨大的无产阶级国际主义的援助。毛主席的题词是我今后活动的伟大目标，我一定要始终把它印在脑子里，认真贯彻到革命实践中去。
    镰田极说，毛主席的题词，必将促使日本人民的革命斗争出现新的局面。题词给了美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团致命的打击，给了人民巨大的鼓舞和巨大的支持。
    她说，宫本修正主义集团背叛马克思列宁主义，破坏日本人民的革命斗争。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践结合起来。只要我们遵照毛主席的教导认真去做，我们就一定能取得革命的胜利。
    德田多津说，当我从广播中听到毛主席的题词的时候，心里非常激动，感谢毛主席对我们的支持。她说，宫本修正主义集团害怕日本人民的革命精神，害怕日本人民的革命斗争，他们走所谓“议会道路”，并妄想以此欺骗日本人民，但是日本人民揭露了它们的阴谋。她说，毛主席的题词，不但对于日本人民而且对于世界各国革命人民，都具有极大的意义。我一定要利用一切机会向日本人民宣传毛主席的这一重要题词。
