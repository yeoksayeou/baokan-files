On September 6th, as soon as night fell, the villagers of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, had returned home after a day's labor. Just then, the joyous news that the entire country was red reached them. Immediately, shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed through the night sky of Dazhai.

Deep into the night, the meeting room of Dazhai Brigade was brightly lit. Men and women villagers filled the room, discussing the great victory of the Cultural Revolution. Everyone's face beamed with happiness, and their hearts were filled with radiant sunshine. Chen Yonggui, the secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Committee, spoke first. He said excitedly, "The entire country is red, and the Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory! This is the greatest encouragement for us, the working class and poor peasants, and a heavy blow to Liu Shaoqi and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Revolutionary people are jubilant, while class enemies are trembling with fear."

As soon as Chen Yonggui finished speaking, the villagers began to discuss. Everyone recalled the battles of the past two years and unanimously said: The Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is truly wise and great. Without this Cultural Revolution, proletarian dictatorship could not be consolidated, the new socialist Dazhai could not be preserved, and the working class and poor peasants would suffer again.

Chen Yonggui posed a question to everyone: "Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has called on the nation to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. What should we people of Dazhai do?" Song Liying, the deputy secretary of the brigade party committee and president of the women's federation, replied with revolutionary fervor: "We poor peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. We will do as Chairman Mao says. Currently, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and fight this battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is a crucial battle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution and a long-term plan to prevent capitalist restoration and consolidate and develop proletarian dictatorship."

The leader of the Iron Girls Brigade, Guo Fenglian, could not contain her excitement and added, "Although the Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, 'this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li.' We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to intensify class struggle, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and accurately and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in Dazhai and throughout the country, forever!"

Passionate speeches followed one after another. Although it was already midnight, the villagers were still full of energy. With boundless affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, they sang "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" to conclude this meaningful meeting and welcomed a new day of battle.

    大寨的欢乐之夜
    九月六日，夜幕刚刚降下，山西省昔阳县大寨大队的社员们劳动一天，已经回家了。正在这时，全国山河一片红的特大喜讯传到了这里。顿时，
  “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，震荡着大寨的夜空。
    夜深了，大寨大队的会议室里，灯光格外明亮，男女社员挤满一屋，畅谈着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，人人脸上露出幸福的笑容，个个心中升起灿烂的太阳。大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志在会上首先发言。他激动地说：“全国山河一片红，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利！这对我们工人阶级和贫下中农是最大的鼓舞，对中国赫鲁晓夫和帝、修、反是沉重的打击。革命人民欢欣鼓舞，阶级敌人胆战心惊。”陈永贵同志刚刚讲完，社员们就议论开了。大伙回顾两年多来的战斗历程，异口同声地说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，真是无比英明，无比伟大。没有这场文化大革命，无产阶级专政就不能巩固，社会主义的新大寨就不能保住，工人阶级和贫下中农就会再吃二遍苦，重受二茬罪。
    陈永贵同志向大家提出一个问题：“伟大领袖毛主席最近向全国发出认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大号召，我们大寨人应该怎么办？”大队党支部副书记、妇代会主任宋立英同志满怀着革命豪情回答说：“俺们贫下中农最忠于毛主席，毛主席咋说俺咋做。当前就是要按照毛主席的教导，打好斗、批、改这一仗。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要一仗，是防止资本主义复辟、巩固和发展无产阶级专政的百年大计。”铁姑娘队负责人郭凤莲按捺不住激动的心情，她接着说：“无产阶级文化大革命虽然取得了决定性胜利，但‘这只是万里长征走完了第一步’。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在大寨、在全国高高飘扬，永远飘扬！”
    热烈的发言，一个接着一个。时间已到午夜，可是社员们依然精神饱满。大伙怀着忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无限深情，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，结束了这次有意义的集会，迎来了新的战斗的一天。
