Edition: 1

In the run-up to the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a piece of exhilarating news has come from the publishing and printing front: the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been officially published. This is yet another achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This new edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is convenient for carrying around and studying at any time, and is specially published by the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front for those who work outdoors and have high mobility.

The newly published pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" uses high-quality thin embossed paper and small, clear fonts. Combined with advanced binding technology, its volume is reduced by more than two-thirds and more than half compared to the previously published separate and bound volumes of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Its cover is made of a durable foam plastic artificial leather, which has the advantages of being waterproof and tear-resistant. This pocket edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" can be carried in one's pocket like the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and can be taken along by workers and soldiers in industries such as meteorology, navigation, forestry, oil, and geological exploration who are constantly on the move in the mountains, forests, borders, and seas. They can carry it with them at all times and study it whenever and wherever they want. The successful printing of the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is another contribution made by the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front to the dissemination of the great thought of Mao Zedong.

During the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front have, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, printed large quantities of Chairman Mao's works for the domestic and international revolutionary people who are eager to learn Mao Zedong Thought, and have established great merits. Over the past two years, with the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become increasingly widespread and in-depth. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers who have long been working outdoors have put forward the demand to print "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in a pocket edition that is convenient for carrying around and studying at any time. It is based on the wishes of the broad revolutionary masses that the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front have started the design and printing work of the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

To change "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from the previously published 32-opening edition to a 64-opening bound edition, while ensuring clear and durable printing, many difficulties need to be overcome in typesetting, printing, binding, paper, and ink. However, the fervent calls from the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers who have long been fighting on the front lines have inspired the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front. The sacred mission of spreading Mao Zedong Thought has encouraged them to overcome difficulties and strive for victory. The revolutionary workers responsible for typesetting, plate-making, and trial printing, with their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction to "do a good job in publishing work." They have pooled their wisdom, fought continuously, and pursued excellence with the greatest enthusiasm and speed, successfully printing the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front in most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have, under the unified leadership of the local revolutionary committees, actively participated in the printing work of the pocket edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," striving to make new contributions to the dissemination of the great thought of Mao Zedong.

The glorious political task of printing the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has also inspired the revolutionary workers in the paper, plastic, ink, commerce, and other industries in our country, as well as the members of rural people's communes and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks. In many places, a moving scene of mutual support among various industries to contribute to the printing of revolutionary classics has emerged. They excitedly said, "The more effort we put into producing revolutionary classics, the more loyalty we show to Chairman Mao!" The official publication of the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought composed jointly by the broad revolutionary masses in various industries and the revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front in our country!

At present, the revolutionary workers in the distribution system are making every effort to prepare for the distribution of the first batch of the pocket edition of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," which has already been published, in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and the capitals of all provinces and autonomous regions during the National Day holiday. They will prioritize delivering it to revolutionary workers and soldiers who work outdoors.

    要把《毛泽东选集》从过去出版的三十二开本改印成六十四开的精装合订本，又要字迹清晰，经久耐用，这在制版、印刷、装订、纸张、油墨等方面都需要克服许多困难。但是，长年战斗在野外的解放军战士和革命职工殷切的呼声激励着出版、印刷战线上的广大革命职工，传播毛泽东思想的崇高使命鼓舞着他们去克服困难，争取胜利。担任排字、制版和试印等工作的革命职工，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，坚决贯彻毛主席的“认真作好出版工作”的光辉指示，群策群力，连续作战，精益求精，以最大的干劲，最快的速度，把《毛泽东选集》一至四卷六十四开精装合订本印制成功。全国绝大多数省、市、自治区出版、印刷战线上的广大革命职工，都在当地革命委员会的统一领导下，积极投入了《毛泽东选集》袖珍本的印制工作，努力为传播伟大的毛泽东思想立新功。
    印制《毛泽东选集》一至四卷六十四开精装合订本的光荣政治任务，也鼓舞着我国造纸、塑料、油墨、商业等行业的革命职工，以及农村人民公社社员和担任“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员，许多地区都出现了各行各业互相支援，共同为印制革命宝书出力的动人景象。他们激动地说：“在生产革命宝书上多出一分力量，就是向毛主席多献一分忠心！”《毛泽东选集》一至四卷六十四开精装合订本的正式出版，就是各行各业广大革命群众和我国出版、印刷战线的革命职工，共同谱成的一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌！
