Experts from Thailand, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries in Beijing warmly hail Chairman Mao's inscription as having great significance for the world revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao's inscription points out the inevitable path to victory for the people's revolutions in various countries. It strongly condemns the crimes of modern revisionism, centered around the Soviet revisionists, for betraying Marxism-Leninism, advocating the "parliamentary road," and opposing armed struggle.

New China News Agency, September 19th: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with Japan's revolutionary practice, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubtedly assured." Today, Thai expert Nida told a reporter from the New China News Agency that this inscription by Chairman Mao, given six years ago to Japanese workers, has important significance for the revolutionary cause of all peoples of the world, especially for the revolutionary cause of the Thai people. The Thai people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, will certainly be able to overthrow the Thanom-Praphat clique and achieve the final victory of the Thai revolution.

Nida said, "People's social existence determines their thoughts. The correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth applicable everywhere. The combination of this universal truth with the revolutionary practices of various countries is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause of the peoples of various countries.

She said, Chairman Mao combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, developing Marxism-Leninism. In contemporary times, to apply the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the specific revolutionary practices of various countries means to apply the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—to the specific revolutionary practices of the peoples of various countries. Combining Mao Zedong Thought with the specific revolutionary practices of various countries is the most important task for the peoples of various countries at present.

She said, our era is the era of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand, in its September 10th call for the publication of the Thai-language "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volumes 1 to 4, said: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the revolutionary peoples of the world, it will become an inexhaustible material force, capable of destroying the old world and creating a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and systems of exploitation."

Nida said, in the six years since Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers, the world has undergone earth-shaking changes. The vigorous development of the world revolution has proven the great significance of Chairman Mao's inscription. In Asia, the revolutionary peoples of Thailand, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other countries, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," persist in armed struggle, using Chairman Mao's strategic thoughts of relying on the peasants, establishing rural base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside, making the revolution continuously advance towards victory. In Japan, the revolutionary struggle led by genuine Marxist-Leninists continues to achieve victories, making the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries, and the Ryoemon revisionist clique continuously fail.

Nida, in her conversation, condemned the revisionists of various countries for betraying Marxism-Leninism, using the excuse of their country's "special" situation to oppose the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, advocating the so-called "parliamentary road," and opposing armed revolutionary struggle. She said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." However, modern revisionists oppose this revolutionary principle, showing that they are actually not revolutionary but counter-revolutionary.

She said, the revolutionary people of Thailand are following Chairman Mao's teachings, combining Marxism-Leninism with their national revolutionary practice. The September 10th call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand points out: "Combining Mao Zedong Thought with Thai revolutionary practice is the decisive factor for the victory of the Thai revolution." The Communist Party of Thailand calls on all party members, cadres, and armed fighters to, according to the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "study with problems, study actively, combine study and use, study first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' aspect," and strive to study Chairman Mao's works.

She said, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved great victories in their armed struggle against the U.S. imperialist invaders and in overthrowing the U.S. imperialists' lackeys, the Thanom-Praphat clique. These victories are achieved by the Thai people using Chairman Mao's brilliant military thoughts on people's war. Our victories are inseparable from Mao Zedong Thought and the support of the 700 million Chinese people for the revolutionary people of Thailand. The most important support is bringing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the Thai people. I am firmly convinced that the Thai people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, will certainly be able to overthrow the Thanom-Praphat clique and seize the final victory of the Thai revolution.

New China News Agency, September 19th: Indonesian expert Mudiro today told a reporter from our agency that Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with Japan's revolutionary practice, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubtedly assured," has extremely great significance for the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people and all peoples of the world. The revolutionary people of Indonesia are determined to firmly walk the path of armed revolution indicated by Chairman Mao until the final victory.

He said, Chairman Mao's inscription is a powerful call to action. The growing and strengthening Japanese proletarian revolutionary faction and broad revolutionary people will certainly, with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as their weapons, more bravely and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, the Japanese monopolistic bourgeoisie, and modern revisionism, and thoroughly smash the conspiracies of the Ryoemon revisionist clique.

Mudiro said, Chairman Mao's inscription is a great encouragement to Indonesian Marxist-Leninists. We must more urgently study the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific revolutionary practice of Indonesia.

He said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Chairman Mao's teachings are the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. The Indonesian people, through their own struggle, truly realize that they must not for a moment depart from Mao Zedong Thought to achieve revolutionary victory; otherwise, it will bring disaster to the revolution. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, in its September 1966 self-criticism, said: "The Indonesian revolution inevitably must adopt the form of armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution, its essence being the armed peasant land revolution led by the proletariat." The revolutionary people of Indonesia have discarded the so-called "peaceful road" and "parliamentary struggle," following Chairman Mao's teachings, have taken up arms, and are actively engaged in armed revolutionary struggle.

Mudiro said, now Indonesia already has an armed force of the people. These armed fighters of the people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are steadfast, brave, fearless of sacrifice for the revolution, and have a high level of revolutionary consciousness. No matter what hardships and difficulties they encounter, they will certainly be able to defeat the "encirclement and suppression" and oppression of the reactionary army of Suharto, equipped with modern weapons by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The Soviet modern revisionists use the "peaceful road" to deceive the Indonesian people, trying to make the Indonesian people lay down their weapons, which is absolutely impossible.

Mudiro said, the revolutionary road of people's war indicated by Chairman Mao is the only glorious and correct road, which will lead the revolution of the Indonesian people to final victory. Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers greatly boosted the confidence of the Indonesian people's revolution. The Indonesian people are unwavering, firmly walking the path of armed revolution indicated by Chairman Mao until the final victory.

New China News Agency, September 19th: Burmese expert U Win Gaw today told a reporter from our agency that Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription to Japanese workers: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with Japan's revolutionary practice, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubtedly assured," is also the inevitable path to victory for the Burmese people's revolution, is a priceless treasure for the Burmese people, and is a priceless treasure for the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are currently engaged in revolutionary struggle.

U Win Gaw said, Chairman Mao combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, solving a series of problems in the Chinese democratic revolution and continuing the revolution under socialist conditions, leading the Chinese revolution from victory to victory. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice has set a brilliant example for us.

U Win Gaw said, Mao Zedong Thought is the most brilliant and great Marxism-Leninism of contemporary times, is the eternal red sun. Today, when talking about Marxism-Leninism, we must emphasize Mao Zedong Thought. Today, accepting or not accepting Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and non-revolution, is the touchstone between Marxism and opportunism.

He said, as long as the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is correctly combined with the revolutionary practice of Burma, the revolution of the Burmese people will advance in great strides. The Burmese people, who have persisted in armed struggle for more than twenty years, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the day of achieving comprehensive revolutionary victory is not far off. The enemies of the Burmese people, although several reactionary cliques have taken the stage in the past twenty-plus years, have all ended in failure. Now, the days of the reactionary government of Ne Win, the agent of imperialism and feudalism, are very difficult, with their heads in chaos and no way out, already on the brink of death.

U Win Gaw said, the revolutionary practice of Burma has proven the following points: it is necessary to seize political power through armed struggle; it is necessary to wage people's war; it is necessary to establish base areas in the countryside, surround the cities from the countryside, and finally occupy the cities to achieve comprehensive victory. This is the only correct road to victory for the Burmese revolution. As long as one follows Chairman Mao's teachings, the victory of the Burmese revolution is undoubtedly assured.

In his conversation, he strongly condemned the modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying Marxism-Leninism and sabotaging the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people; he condemned the Burmese revisionists, like foreign revisionists, for surrendering to the reactionaries. U Win Gaw said, the Communist Party of Burma and the armed forces of the Burmese people, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the revolutionary practice of Burma, steadfastly and unyieldingly engage in armed struggle, and are advancing bravely.

    在京泰国印尼缅甸等国专家热烈欢呼毛主席题词对世界革命事业有极为重大意义
    毛主席题词指出各国人民革命胜利的必由之路
    强烈谴责以苏修为中心的现代修正主义背叛马列主义、推行“议会道路”、反对武装斗争的罪行
    新华社十九日讯　“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”在北京的泰国专家妮达今天对新华社记者说，毛主席六年前给日本工人朋友的这一题词，对全世界人民的革命事业，特别是对泰国人民的革命事业，同样具有重要意义。泰国人民按照毛主席的教导去斗争，一定能够推翻他侬—巴博集团，取得泰国革命的最后胜利。
    妮达说，毛主席教导我们：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的真理，这个普遍真理与各国革命实践相结合，是各国人民革命事业胜利的根本保证。
    她说，毛主席把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，发展了马克思列宁主义。在当代，我们说把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理运用到各国革命的具体实践，就是要运用当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想于各国人民革命的具体实践中去。把毛泽东思想同各国革命的具体实践结合起来，这是当前各国人民最重要的任务。
    她说，我们的时代是毛泽东思想的时代。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。泰国共产党中央九月十日为泰文《毛泽东选集》一至四卷出版发表的号召书中说：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想为全世界革命人民所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的物质力量，就能够消灭旧世界，创建起一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。”
    妮达说，毛主席给日本工人朋友题词六年以来，世界发生了翻天覆地的变化。世界革命的蓬勃发展，证明了毛主席题词的重大意义。在亚洲，泰国、缅甸、马来亚、印尼、菲律宾等国的革命人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，坚持武装斗争，运用毛主席关于依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市的战略思想，使革命不断走向胜利。在日本，真正的马克思列宁主义者领导的革命斗争不断取得胜利，使美帝、日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团的阴谋诡计不断遭到失败。
    妮达在谈话中谴责各国修正主义者背叛马克思列宁主义，以本国情况“特殊”为借口，反对马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，推行所谓“议会道路”，反对武装革命斗争。她说，毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”可是现代修正主义者反对这一革命原则，说明他们实际上是不革命，是反革命的。
    她说，泰国革命人民正按照毛主席的教导，把马克思列宁主义与本国革命实践结合起来。泰国共产党中央九月十日的号召书中指出：“把毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合，是泰国革命胜利的决定因素。”泰国共产党号召全体党员、干部、人民武装战士根据林彪副主席的指示：“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，努力学习毛主席著作。
    她说，泰国人民在泰国共产党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在抗击美帝国主义侵略者，在推翻美帝的走狗他侬—巴博集团的武装斗争中获得了伟大胜利。这些胜利是泰国人民运用毛主席的人民战争的光辉军事思想取得的。我们的胜利离不开毛泽东思想，离不开七亿中国人民对泰国革命人民的援助，其中最主要的援助是给泰国人民送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我坚信，泰国人民根据毛主席的教导，一定能够推翻他侬—巴博集团，夺取泰国革命的最后胜利。
    新华社十九日讯　在北京的印度尼西亚专家穆迪罗今天向本社记者说，毛主席给日本工人朋友的题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的”，对印尼人民和全世界人民的革命事业有着极为重大的意义。印尼革命人民决心坚定地走毛主席指引的武装革命的道路，直到最后胜利。
    他说，毛主席的题词，是一个强有力的号召书。正在不断成长壮大的日本无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民，一定会以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，更勇敢、更坚决地反对美帝国主义，反对日本垄断资产阶级，反对现代修正主义，大造宫本修正主义集团的反。
    穆迪罗说，毛主席的题词，对印尼马克思列宁主义者是一个巨大的鼓舞。我们一定要更抓紧学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，并且按照毛主席的教导，认真地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与印尼革命的具体实践相结合。
    他说，毛主席教导我们说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“枪杆子里面出政权”。毛主席的教导是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。印尼人民通过自己的斗争经历真正认识到，他们要取得革命的胜利，就一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想，否则就会给革命带来灾难。印尼共产党中央政治局在一九六六年九月的自我批评中说：“印度尼西亚革命不可避免地必须采取武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命这一主要的斗争形式，其实质是无产阶级领导下的武装的农民土地革命。”革命的印尼人民抛弃所谓“和平道路”、“议会斗争”，按照毛主席的教导，已经拿起武器，积极开展革命的武装斗争。
    穆迪罗说，现在印尼已经有了一支人民的武装队伍。这支人民武装的战士是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，是坚定、勇敢、为革命不怕牺牲的、具有高度革命觉悟的战士。不管会遇到怎样的艰苦和困难，他们一定能打败用美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的现代化武器装备起来的苏哈托反动军队的“围剿”和镇压。苏联现代修正主义者用“和平道路”来欺骗印尼人民，想使印尼人民放下武器，这是永远办不到的。
    穆迪罗说，毛主席指引的人民战争的革命道路，是唯一光荣正确的道路，这条道路将把印尼人民的革命引向最后胜利。毛主席给日本工人朋友的题词，大大鼓舞了印尼人民革命的信心，印尼人民丝毫不动摇，坚定地走毛主席指引的武装革命的道路，直到最后胜利。
    新华社十九日讯　在北京的缅甸专家吴迎高今天向本社记者说，毛主席给日本工人朋友的光辉题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的”，也是缅甸人民革命取得胜利的必由之路，是缅甸人民的无价之宝，是正在进行革命斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命人民的无价之宝。
    吴迎高说，毛主席把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，解决了中国民主革命以及在社会主义条件下继续进行革命的一系列问题，领导中国革命从胜利走向胜利。毛主席的伟大革命实践，为我们树立了光辉的典范。
    吴迎高说，毛泽东思想是当代最光辉最伟大的马克思列宁主义，是永远不落的红太阳。在今天，说到马克思列宁主义，我们就必须突出毛泽东思想。在今天，接受不接受毛泽东思想，是革命还是不革命的分水岭，是马克思主义还是机会主义的试金石。
    他说，只要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理同缅甸的革命实践正确地结合起来，缅甸人民的革命就会大踏步地前进。坚持了二十多年武装斗争的缅甸人民，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，取得革命全面胜利的日子已经为期不远了。缅甸人民的敌人在过去二十多年中，虽然几个反动集团相继登台，但都以失败而告终。现在，帝国主义、封建主义的代理人——奈温反动政府的日子很不好过，焦头烂额，走投无路，已到了死亡的边缘。
    吴迎高说，缅甸的革命实践证明了以下几点：必须武装夺取政权；必须进行人民战争；必须在农村建立根据地，以农村包围城市，最后占领城市，夺取全面胜利。这是缅甸革命取得胜利的唯一正确的道路。只要遵照毛主席的教导去做，缅甸革命取得胜利是毫无疑义的。
    他在谈话中强烈谴责以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义背叛马克思列宁主义，破坏缅甸人民的革命斗争；谴责缅甸的修正主义者和国外的修正主义者一样，向反动派屈服。吴迎高说，缅甸共产党和缅甸人民武装力量，牢记毛主席的教导，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同缅甸革命实践相结合，坚定不移地进行武装斗争，正在奋勇前进。
