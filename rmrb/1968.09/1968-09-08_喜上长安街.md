The entire nation is red, and Beijing is even redder. On both sides of East and West Chang'an Avenue, the lights are shining brightly. Good news has arrived, summoning countless joyous processions, and bringing forth millions of vibrant red flags! On this early autumn night, the vast ten-mile-long Chang'an Avenue has unfolded a magnificent and grand scene.

In our hearts, the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, two years ago today, you personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; two years later today, the entire nation is red! What a magnificent sight!

Joy fills our hearts, joy fills Chang'an Avenue!

At the front of each joyous procession, the large red double joy characters shine brightly. Electric cars pulling big drums have arrived, six mallets striking together, playing a thunderous symphony of joy.

Under the bright streetlights, the propaganda team of Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from Factory 109 is performing wonderful acts, enthusiastically celebrating the entire nation turning red! They do not rest, they do not sleep, rehearsing new dances and composing new lyrics all night, expressing their joyful hearts. Listen!

Drums beat, songs rise,
The entire nation achieves redness.
Mountains smile, seas smile,
Hailing the great leader
Mao Zedong!

The working class loves Chairman Mao the most, loves Mao Zedong Thought the most. As soon as a few drops of rain fell from the sky, they raised plastic sheets to cover Chairman Mao's portrait!

On the northern red wall of Chang'an Avenue, countless slogans and banners have been added overnight! These are the comrades from the chemical defense troops, setting up ladders over five meters high, writing large slogans on the red wall: "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They write on red paper with bold characters. First on the ground, but the wind blew at night, scattering the paper. They then stick the paper to the wall and write on it.

Writing characters two meters square is not easy on a ladder! The comrade writing holds a brush in one hand and a basin of red dye in the other, dipping and outlining stroke by stroke. Soon, his arm aches, his waist hurts. Someone said, "Come down and rest a bit!" He said, "No, to welcome the entire nation turning red, I must write out our intentions at the fastest speed!"

Chairman Mao's Red Guards, the pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, today, seeing the entire nation turn red, how can they not be overjoyed! The propaganda team of Red Guards from Beijing No. 28 Middle School, at one in the morning, is still singing in front of Tiananmen. The new lyrics they hurriedly composed to celebrate the entire nation turning red are already memorized perfectly. Yet, they are still not at ease.

Under the electric lights, Li Yanhong takes out a pen, spreads out her palm, and writes the words she has memorized on her palm, densely packed, with clear strokes. Someone asks her, "Why are you doing this?" She smiles and says, "Propagating Mao Zedong Thought, not a single word can be forgotten! Better safe than sorry. If I forget, I can look at my hand and remember it again." What lovely Red Guards of Chairman Mao, revolutionary little generals!

A team of Little Red Guards from Dongcheng New Open Road Primary School, returning from reporting joy at the West Gate of Zhongnanhai, sings, dances, and propagates Mao Zedong Thought all the way. At the side of Jinshui Bridge, they are surrounded by the joyous crowd, singing and dancing without end. People ask for their names, and they all shake their heads and smile, clearly saying, "We are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards!"

Firecrackers streak across the sky like meteors, and the ground is covered with red and green paper scraps. Joy fills Chang'an Avenue, songs fill Beijing City. Comrades from New China Newsreel aim their cameras at the wonderful and moving scenes, turning on a 10,000-watt mercury lamp. Comrades from the radio station aim their recording machines at the most beautiful sounds and turn on the switch.

Our great leader Chairman Mao! Under your personal leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation across the entire nation. This is a tremendous joy, how can people not be ecstatic!

### 喜上长安街

    喜上长安街
    全国一片红，北京红更浓。
    东西长安街两旁，灯火辉煌。喜讯飞来，召唤出多少支报喜纵队，卷来了千万面鲜艳红旗！初秋的夜里，宽广的十里长安街，铺开了一幅宏伟壮丽的画卷。
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席啊！两年前的今天，您亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火；两年后的今天，全国山河一片红！这是多么壮丽的一幕！
    喜上心头，喜上长安街！
    支支报喜队伍前面，大红双喜字发出光芒。电瓶车拉着大鼓过来了，六只槌一齐敲下去，奏出震天动地的报喜的交响乐。
    明亮的街灯下，一○九厂工人毛泽东思想宣传队，正在演出精采节目，热烈庆祝全国山河一片红！他们不休息，不睡觉，连夜排新舞蹈，编新唱词，表达自己的喜悦的心意。听吧！
    锣鼓响，歌声起，
    全国实现一片红。
    山也笑，海也笑，
    欢呼伟大领袖
      毛泽东！
    工人阶级最热爱毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想。天空刚洒下几点小雨，他们就举起塑料布，把毛主席的画像遮上！
    在长安街北面的红墙上，连夜又添了多少标语和口号！那是防化学兵的同志，架起五米多高的长梯，在红墙上写大标语：“无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！”他们在红纸上写着醒目的大字。先是在地上写，可是深夜起风了，纸给刮得飘起来。他们就把纸贴到墙上，然后再写。
    两米见方的字，站在梯子上可不好写啊！写字的同志一手拿刷子，一手拿红粉水盆，一笔一笔蘸，一笔一笔描。不一会，他的臂酸了，腰痛了。有人说：“下来歇一歇吧！”他说：“不，迎接全国一片红，我要用最快的速度，写出我们的心意！”
    毛主席的红卫兵，无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，今天，他们看到全国一片红，心中怎能不喜悦万分！北京二十八中的红卫兵宣传队，到午夜一点钟，还在天安门前歌唱。她们赶编的庆祝全国一片红的新词，已经记得滚瓜烂熟。可是，她们还不放心。
    电灯光下，李延铃掏出钢笔，伸开手掌，把记在心头的词，又写在手心上，密密麻麻，笔划分明。有人问她：“你为什么这样？”她笑笑道：“宣传毛泽东思想，一字也不能忘！不怕一万，就怕万一。万一我记不得的时候，好伸出手来看看，再记心上。”多么可爱的毛主席的红卫兵，革命的小将！
    东城新开路小学的一队红小兵，从中南海西门报喜归来，一路歌，一路舞，一路宣传毛泽东思想。在金水桥旁，给报喜的人群围住了，她们向天安门扬手，唱出毛主席万寿无疆！
    她们向东城走，路上又被人拦住，歌不完，舞不断。人们问她们的名字，一个个摇头微笑，清脆地说：“我们是毛主席的红小兵！”
    花炮在天空流星般穿过，地上铺满了红绿纸片。喜上长安街，歌满北京城。新影的同志们，把镜头对准精采动人的画面，打开一万瓦的水银灯。电台的同志们，把录音机对准最美好的声音按开了电门。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席啊！在您的亲自领导下，无产阶级文化大革命已经在全国范围内进入了斗、批、改的阶段。这是天大的喜事，人们怎么能不万分欢腾！
