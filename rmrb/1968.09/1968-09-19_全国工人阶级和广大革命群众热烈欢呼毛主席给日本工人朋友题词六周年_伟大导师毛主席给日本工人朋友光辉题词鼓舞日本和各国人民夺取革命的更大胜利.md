They unanimously point out that Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription has shown the world's people the inevitable path to revolutionary victory. The Japanese people and revolutionary people of all countries, as long as they combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of their own revolutions, bravely fight, fear no hardships, and advance courageously, will definitely achieve the final victory of the revolution.

The workers and revolutionary masses of our country joyfully listened to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's important inscription last night and immediately held study sessions and discussions. Many workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in colleges and universities promptly propagated to revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards. Many factories and enterprises rushed to print and distribute Chairman Mao's important inscription to the masses. Some regions also held mass celebration rallies.

In study sessions, discussions, and celebration rallies, the broad masses of workers and revolutionary people across the country, in connection with the current excellent global revolutionary situation, enthusiastically praised the profound significance of Chairman Mao's inscription for the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people and the people of the world. They pointed out that today, the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people and the people of all countries are surging, the truly Marxist-Leninist leftist forces are growing stronger, and the struggles of the working class and revolutionary people of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries are continuously achieving new victories. The publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription will further inspire the working class and revolutionary people of Japan and all countries to achieve greater victories.

Students from various parts of the country who came to the capital to participate in the national defense industry Mao Zedong Thought study class held a study and discussion session last night. They said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader and greatest genius of the proletariat of our time. Chairman Mao and the people of the world revolution are heart to heart, wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription will definitely inspire the proletariat and revolutionary people of all countries to better combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of their own revolutions and bravely fight for the final victory of the revolution."

Chen Jinfeng, a worker from Chengdu Wood Processing Factory and a member of the Chengdu Revolutionary Committee, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's important inscription has pointed out the fundamental path to revolutionary victory for the Japanese people and the people of all countries. The great victories achieved by the Chinese people in revolutionary struggles are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese working class firmly believes that our today is Japan's tomorrow. The Japanese working class will combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution, and will definitely create a true revolutionary party in the revolutionary struggle, thoroughly smash the traitorous clique of Gombun revisionism, overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Sato reactionary government, and achieve the final victory of the revolution."

The crew members of the "Liaoyuan" cargo ship, which recently returned to Shanghai from Japan, held a meeting and discussion. The "Liaoyuan" was the first Chinese cargo ship to sail to Japan in 1964. The crew members personally witnessed the Japanese people's limitless love for the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and saw the revolutionary scene of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, deeply entering the hearts of the Japanese people. They said, "The Japanese people, in their struggle against American imperialism, the Sato reactionary government, and the traitorous clique of Gombun revisionism, hold Chairman Mao's portrait in their hands, sing 'The East Is Red,' and read the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' Under the invincible inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the struggles of the Japanese people have achieved one victory after another. They believe that the Japanese working class, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription, will definitely be able to better apply Marxism-Leninism to the revolutionary practice of Japan, fully play the leading role of the working class, unite the revolutionary people of all classes, and achieve the final victory of the Japanese revolution. The brilliant conclusions in Chairman Mao's inscription will definitely become a brilliant reality in Japan and throughout the world."

In studying and discussing Chairman Mao's important inscription, the broad masses of workers and revolutionary people across the country reviewed the course of their revolutionary struggles under the great leader Chairman Mao, deeply feeling that without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary movement. Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought has become the action of billions of revolutionary masses, and the revolution is invincible. Old workers from the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in Tsinghua University and Guangdong Institute of Technology excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription has shown the revolutionary people of all countries the direction of victory. The practice from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution stage in our country has proven that only Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective, and only Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most effective. In the course of the Chinese revolution, although we have encountered countless difficulties and obstacles, waves and storms, with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, we can break through all difficulties and make the revolution advance rapidly."

Workers from the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Factory discussed Chairman Mao's inscription by the side of the machines in the workshop. They said excitedly, "The North Star shines brightly, Chairman Mao is the great savior of the people. The victorious course that the Chinese people have traveled under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao makes us firmly believe that the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of all countries, as long as they combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of their own revolutions and persist in the struggle, will definitely achieve the victory of the revolution."

Workers from the Hangzhou Dongfanghong Silk Weaving Factory, who are day and night embroidering portraits of Chairman Mao, said at the discussion meeting, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon against imperialism and revisionism. Chairman Mao pointed out the truth of revolutionary victory for the revolutionary people of all countries in the inscription. The Chinese working class, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is determined to hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, together with the working class of the whole world, and carry out the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle to the end!"

"People who have already achieved revolutionary victory should aid the struggles of those still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The workers and revolutionary masses of our country, while celebrating the publication of the brilliant inscription by the great leader Chairman Mao, re-read Chairman Mao's teaching and felt it particularly close to their hearts. They said, "The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has the firmest footing and the strongest backbone. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching, unite with the working class and revolutionary people of the whole world, and bravely struggle for the liberation of all mankind. The sailors of the 'Hongqi 158' and '145' ships of Guangzhou Huangpu Port, who are responsible for foreign aid missions, said, 'We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching, take Comrade White as an example, carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and resolutely complete the transportation tasks of aiding Vietnam and fighting America. The provocations and bombings of American bandits will not shake the iron will of Chinese sailors to aid Vietnam and fight America, nor will they shake the determination of Chinese sailors to support the world revolution.' Liu Lianren, a leader of the Grass Bay Brigade of Gaomi County, Shandong Province, who was persecuted by Japanese militarism and lived in caves in Japan for thirteen years but was aided by the Japanese people to return to the motherland, said, 'I personally suffered the brutal persecution of Japanese imperialism, and it was the Japanese people who aided me, enabling me to return to the great motherland. Now, the Japanese people are waging a resolute struggle against American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Sato reactionary government, and the traitorous clique of Gombun revisionism. We Chinese peasants will definitely carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, do a good job in revolution and production, and support the struggles of the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of the world."

Broad masses of industrial workers across the country have expressed that they will, while being in the workshop, have a global perspective, look at the world, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, step by step, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with the great achievements of combining revolution with production, support the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people and the people of the world. Workers from the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams leading the educational revolution in various colleges and universities in Changchun City said, "The Chinese working class and the Japanese working class are heart to heart. We have always regarded the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people as our own cause. The Chinese Khrushchev and the Japanese Gombun revisionist traitorous clique are birds of a feather. They are all shameful traitors who oppose and betray the revolution. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, build a great socialist motherland, and better support the world revolution."

Some textile factories in Xi'an and the Shijiazhuang Cotton Mill No. 2, after sending a large number of outstanding workers to participate in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the workers who remained in the factories seriously carried out the struggle, criticism, and reform, bravely shouldered the double burden of grasping revolution and promoting production, and wove more and better cotton cloth. The workers expressed that the working class will hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, turn the factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, produce more and better products to support the world revolution. Tibetan workers of serf origin and emancipated poor serfs said, "We, the broad masses of Tibetan and Han workers and millions of emancipated serfs, will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, unite closely with the revolutionary people of the world, regard the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries as our own struggles, and contribute our strength to better support the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people and the people of the world."

    各地广大工人和革命群众在学习座谈毛主席的重要题词时，回顾了跟随伟大领袖毛主席闹革命的战斗历程，深切体会到：没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想化为亿万革命群众的行动，革命就无往而不胜。进驻北京清华大学和广东工学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的老工人兴奋地说，毛主席的光辉题词，为各国革命人民指明了胜利航向。从我国民主革命到社会主义革命阶段的实践证明，只有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想最灵，只有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最灵。在中国革命的道路上，虽然遇到无数艰难险阻，惊涛骇浪，但是有了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就能冲破重重困难，使革命迅速前进。江西拖拉机制造厂的工人们在车间机器旁边座谈毛主席的题词。他们无限兴奋地说，北斗星，亮晶晶，毛主席是人民的大救星。中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下所走过的胜利航程，使我们坚信，日本人民和世界各国革命人民，只要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，同本国革命的具体实践结合起来，坚持斗争，就一定会取得革命的胜利。正在日夜织造毛主席绣像的杭州东方红丝织厂革命职工，在座谈会上说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想是反帝反修最强大的思想武器。毛主席在题词中为各国革命人民指出了夺取革命胜利的真理。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国工人阶级，决心同全世界工人阶级一起，更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把反帝反修斗争进行到底！
