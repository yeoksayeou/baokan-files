With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, the Yangquan Coal Mine fully plays the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, firmly takes the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, and the revolutionary production situation in the entire mine area is excellent. All units in the mine area have achieved revolutionary great unity, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is widely and deeply developing, and the revolutionary great criticism is surging higher and higher. Coal production has continuously increased significantly.

	New China News Agency, Taiyuan, September 23rd - The broad masses of coal miners in Shanxi's Yangquan Coal Mine, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, earnestly carry out the resolutions of the national coal industry line's conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production, take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, and the entire mine area's revolutionary situation is unprecedentedly excellent, with production rapidly developing.

	Currently, all units under the entire mining bureau have achieved revolutionary great unity by system, by unit, and by team. Some units have established revolutionary committees with three-in-one combinations. More than 2,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, and the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is widely and deeply developing. The mass revolutionary criticism is surging higher and higher. Coal production has continuously increased significantly, with July's coal production being 1.6 times higher than June's, August's being 24.5% higher than July's, exceeding the state plan and surpassing the monthly production levels of previous years. All mines and pits in August created new high-yield records since the mine's establishment. In September, all employees of the entire mine, based on stable production, strive for high production to welcome National Day, and coal production continues to rise.

	At the national coal industry line's conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production held in May, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received the attending representatives twice. Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters also gave instructions on Yangquan's Cultural Revolution, greatly encouraging the revolutionary masses and the broad masses of Yangquan Coal Mine. The broad masses of coal miners excitedly said: Chairman Mao truly cares for us and protects us. The words of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin truly resonate with our hearts. We understand clearly and see clearly. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advancing bravely!

	Under the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, the revolutionary masses have jointly established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, earnestly studying and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely executing the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, uniting as one, jointly fighting against the enemy, exposing the bad elements who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and criticizing their crimes of inciting the masses to fight against the masses and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers, under the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary "multi-center theory," criticizing "self-centeredness," "revolution for oneself," and other bourgeois factionalism and individualism, and jointly recalling bitterness and sweetness. Through these activities, the two revolutionary factions in all units of the mine quickly united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and the three-in-one combination work has been promoted.

	The "Sixteen Points" personally presided over and formulated by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful impetus for the development of productive forces in our country." With the deepening of the revolutionary great criticism and the rapid achievement of revolutionary great unity, the boundless creative power hidden in the masses immediately bursts out. Revolutionary workers say: The class enemies have been trying every means to sabotage coal production and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seize the revolution and promote production to make Chairman Mao proud! Many miners, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, go to work early and return late, completing their team's production tasks in advance, and actively supporting others. Many workers' families, including children in their teens, also eagerly contribute to producing more coal, forming groups to send tea to the pits. The heroic miners, breaking through numerous difficulties, created one high-yield record after another, making coal production steadily rise. The railway workers also cooperated well, proposing, "The mine produces as much coal as we transport!" Continuously breaking the highest coal transportation records.

	Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a great instruction: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." The broad masses of workers in Yangquan Coal Mine, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are determined to advance at a faster pace, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, closely following the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, advancing victoriously, and creating new achievements for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    阳泉煤矿坚定地走突出政治的道路革命生产形势大好
    全矿区各单位实现了革命大联合，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动广泛深入发展，革命大批判一浪高过一浪，煤炭生产大幅度地持续上升
    新华社太原二十三日电　山西阳泉煤矿的广大矿工，在中国人民解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真贯彻全国煤炭工业战线抓革命促生产会议的决议，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，整个矿区革命形势空前大好，生产迅速发展。
    现在，全矿务局所属各单位都已按系统、按单位、按班组实现了革命大联合，有一部分单位建立了三结合的革命委员会。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办了两千多期，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正广泛深入发展。群众性的革命大批判一浪高过一浪。煤炭生产大幅度地持续上升，七月份煤炭产量比六月份提高一点六倍，八月份又比七月份提高百分之二十四点五，超额完成了国家计划，超过了历年来的月产水平，所有的矿和坑口八月份都创造了建矿以来的最新的高产纪录。九月份，全矿职工在稳产的基础上夺取高产，迎接国庆，煤炭生产又继续上升。
    在今年五月召开全国煤炭工业战线抓革命促生产会议的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席两次接见出席会议的代表，毛主席的无产阶级司令部还对阳泉的文化大革命作了指示，给阳泉煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大群众以极大的鼓舞。广大煤矿工人激动地说：毛主席真是太关怀我们了，太爱护我们了。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的话句句说到了我们心坎里。我们听了心里明，眼睛亮。我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进！
    广大革命职工在人民解放军支左部队帮助下，联合办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，团结一致，共同对敌，揪出了混入革命队伍的坏人，批判了他们挑动群众斗群众，破坏文化大革命的罪行。革命职工在毛泽东思想学习班里，在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，批判资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”，批判“以我为核心”、
  “唯我独革”等资产阶级山头主义、个人主义思想，并且共同忆苦思甜。经过这些活动，全矿各单位两派革命职工很快就在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来了，并且推动三结合的工作向前发展。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”随着革命大批判的深入开展和革命大联合的迅速实现，蕴藏在群众中的无限的创造力立即迸发出来。广大革命职工说：阶级敌人一直想方设法破坏煤炭生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们一定要抓好革命，促好生产，为毛主席争气！许多矿工不怕苦不怕累，早上班晚下班，提前完成了自己班组的生产任务，又主动去支援别人。许多职工家属，包括十来岁的孩子，也争着为多出煤贡献力量，成群结队地把茶水送到坑口。英雄的矿工们，冲破重重困难，创造了一个又一个高产纪录，使煤炭生产稳步上升。铁路工人也配合得很好，他们提出“矿区产多少煤，我们拉多少煤！”接连不断地突破煤炭运输最高纪录。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席发出伟大指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”阳泉煤矿的广大工人学习了毛主席的最新指示，决心以更快的步伐，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，乘胜前进，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功！
