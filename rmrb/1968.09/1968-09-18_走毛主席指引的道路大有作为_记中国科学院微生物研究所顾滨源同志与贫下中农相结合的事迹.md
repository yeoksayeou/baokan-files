At the first conference of active learners and practitioners of Mao Zedong Thought in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a young scientific and technological warrior, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, reported on his experience of following Chairman Mao's teachings, uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and undergoing ideological transformation. His speech deeply touched the hearts of all attendees. This young scientific and technological warrior is Guo Binyuan from the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Taking the First Step

In early 1965, our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Twenty-three Articles." The Four Clean-ups movement was vigorously carried out under Chairman Mao's guidance. At this time, Guo Binyuan reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to unite with the workers and peasants and actually do so." He eagerly volunteered to participate in the Four Clean-ups, determined to unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and undergo tempering and transformation in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

One day in August, the Four Clean-ups work team arrived at Shitai Village, Dagu Commune, Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province. Guo Binyuan stayed with an old poor peasant named Tian Fude. Tian Fude was originally from Shandong but was forced to flee to Yuncheng, Shanxi, by landlords. He worked as a long-term laborer for landlords in Yuncheng for forty years, enduring endless humiliation and exploitation. It was Chairman Mao who liberated Tian Fude, and Tian Fude had boundless love for Chairman Mao and socialism!

Grandpa Tian cared for and looked after Guo Binyuan like his own child. Once, Guo Binyuan fell ill, and Grandpa Tian was extremely worried, quickly finding a doctor to treat him. Guo Binyuan had a high fever and could not eat, so Grandpa Tian tirelessly traveled to a distant town to buy steamed buns for him to eat and gave him his precious honey to treat his asthma. Grandpa Tian always said, "You are sent by Chairman Mao, and we poor and lower-middle peasants are one family." The deep class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply moved Guo Binyuan.

Through eating, living, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, Guo Binyuan truly understood Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." He couldn't help but recall that nine years ago, influenced by bourgeois ideology, after graduating from a junior agricultural school, he longed for big cities and fame, using the opportunity to attend university to leave the countryside. After graduating from university in 1961, he lived in high-rise buildings built by workers and ate rice and flour grown by peasants, but he had not contributed anything to the country or the people. He felt ashamed and felt he had let down Chairman Mao and the workers and peasants who had raised him.

Chairman Mao said, "All intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should happily go there. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." Guo Binyuan reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings and made a firm decision to forever follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, forever unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly transform his worldview, and in this vast world of the countryside, contribute everything to the socialist revolution and construction.

Addressing the Urgent Needs of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Guo Binyuan repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle.... If this fundamental question is not resolved, many other questions will also be difficult to resolve." He determined his direction and took one step at a time.

Soon after arriving at the second brigade of Shitai Village, the community members were worried about the "dry soil" in the eggplant fields. The eggplants in the brigade turned from green to yellow and were about to wither. Someone said, "Just pull them out, they're not worth much." Old Grandpa Tian heard this and pulled Guo Binyuan's arm, saying, "Old Guo, other vegetables haven't grown yet, and in ten days it will be the Mid-Autumn Festival. If we pull them out, what will the community members eat?" Guo Binyuan went to the eggplant field and examined a few leaves, finding tiny red spiders on the back. It turned out that the secret of the "dry soil" was here. The nearby cotton fields also had these pests. Guo Binyuan thought, cotton fields are easy to treat, but what pesticide to use for eggplant fields? The books didn't mention it. If the wrong pesticide is used, who will be responsible? Forget it, don't take the risk. But then he thought of Grandpa Tian's words, "What will the community members eat?" The poor and lower-middle peasants always think of the collective, while he thought of losing face and avoiding responsibility, wasn't this too far from the poor and lower-middle peasants? After a struggle, he finally decided: address the urgent needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

He immediately discussed with the poor and lower-middle peasants and decided to find a way to eliminate the red spiders and protect the cotton and eggplants. They carefully analyzed and chose a pesticide that was both effective and had low toxicity. That night, they organized young people to carry lanterns and work overnight, quickly spraying the pesticide. A few days later, the eggplants turned from yellow to green, and they harvested more than three thousand pounds of eggplants, solving the vegetable problem for the brigade and also allocating more than a thousand pounds to urban residents. The community members said, "Don't believe in ghosts, don't believe in gods, listen to Chairman Mao's words, believe in scientific principles." The brigade quickly established a scientific experiment team, starting from production practice, and carried out scientific experiment activities such as cotton pest control, poison killing mole crickets, wheat seed treatment, and good seed cultivation.

The second production brigade where Guo Binyuan was located had the worst draft animals in the entire commune. The brigade's 1,050 mu of cultivated land had only about twenty draft animals, of which eleven were relatively weak. During the busy spring plowing season, the draft animal problem became a key issue. The feeder and Communist Party member Zhao Zhiqiang had long wanted to change this backward situation but had not found a suitable method.

"Whatever the poor and lower-middle peasants need, I will do it." Guo Binyuan came to the second brigade's stable. Zhao Zhiqiang was very happy to see Old Guo and said, "You had a way to control pests earlier, can you think of a way to fatten the cows a bit?" Guo Binyuan did not immediately answer. He studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "No matter who wants to understand something, except to come into contact with that thing, that is, to live (practice) in that environment, there is no way to solve it." He first came to the stable to participate in labor, carefully observing the health and living conditions of the animals, and consulting with the feeders, finally discovering that the main reason for the animals' weakness and soft bones was poor feed quality. The main feed, wheat straw, had thick and hard stems that were difficult to digest. He thought of someone who had done an experiment with alkaline-treated straw to feed animals. Could they use alkaline-treated wheat straw to feed the animals? He told this idea to the brigade's cadres and feeders. At first, everyone had some reservations. They heard that alkaline-treated straw required lime, fearing that the cows would not become pregnant, miscarry, or the calves would not grow. At this time, Guo Binyuan and everyone studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the three great revolutionary movements, and at the same time explained the benefits of alkaline-treated straw. Zhao Zhiqiang listened and immediately led a few young people to bring lime and bricks from their homes, build a stove and water tank, and start the experiment. They first chose four representative young, pregnant, weak, and thin cows to feed. After feeding for more than twenty days, there was no significant change in their condition, and some people wavered. However, Communist Party member Zhao Zhiqiang wanted to feed the animals well and continued the experiment without wavering, deeply educating Guo Binyuan and strengthening his confidence. They improved the feeding methods while studying Chairman Mao's instructions: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's words boosted everyone's courage, and the alkaline-treated straw experiment was finally persevered.

The saying goes, "Cows and horses in the year of the horse, donkeys at the right time." Cows gaining weight is slow. Three months later, the experimental cows showed significant changes, all fat and healthy with shiny fur. A cow that used to have diarrhea and could not get up was now strong and had even mated and become pregnant. Seeing the real results, the community members eagerly requested that all draft animals be fed alkaline-treated straw, not just cows, but also donkeys, mules, and horses, and quickly promoted it to the entire brigade and commune. Later, the county held an on-site meeting in Shitai Village, promoting the alkaline-treated straw feeding method throughout the county.

More than a year of practice proved that alkaline-treated straw feeding had a significant effect. In Yuncheng County in 1966, the increase in draft animals was 11%, the highest in history. This is a great achievement of the socialist education movement in rural areas and a great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The Masses Are the True Heroes

Lack of fertilizer is a major obstacle to the development of grain and cotton production.

Raising pigs is an important way to solve the fertilizer problem, and solving the feed problem is the key to developing the pig industry.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Raising pigs is a major issue related to fertilizer, meat, and earning foreign exchange through exports." He also pointed out: "Pig feed is easy to solve. Certain grasses, certain tree leaves, sweet potato vines, and sweet potatoes are all feed. It is not necessary to use refined feed, especially not to use a lot of refined feed."

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, Guo Binyuan took the lead in helping the masses solve this urgent problem—opening up sources of pig feed. He went deep into the masses, observing, listening, and consulting. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Pigs eat a hundred kinds of grass, all depending on people to find it." He saw that many community members used ground wheat bran, corn cobs, sweet potato vines, cotton leaves, corn stalks, and sorghum husks to feed pigs, which gave him great inspiration. He realized that as long as he followed Chairman Mao's instructions and relied closely on the masses, learned from the masses, he would definitely succeed.

He wondered if alkaline-treated wheat straw could be used to feed pigs? Although its nutritional value was relatively low, it was abundant. If the experiment was successful, it could open a path for the large-scale development of collective pig raising. Thus, he began the experiment at the brigade's pig farm. Considering the pig's digestive ability and appetite, they used the method of grinding and alkalizing wheat straw, vines, and weeds, and then fermenting them for feeding, while mixing in a small amount of refined feed. After the experiment, this method could save some refined feed and changed the old view that "pigs are grain-eating mouths" for thousands of years.

To make up for the lack of protein in coarse feed, they decided to add a dozen microbial strains for the experiment. They brought the strains from Beijing. To inoculate and propagate these strains, they used an ink bottle as a sterilizer and alcohol lamp, used white wine instead of alcohol, and tied a used needle to a chopstick as an inoculation rod, and finally succeeded.

Receiving Re-education from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "A person who goes from such a primary school to such a university, graduates, and is considered to have knowledge. But he only has book knowledge and has not participated in any practical activities, has not applied the knowledge he learned to any department of life. Can such a person be considered a complete intellectual? I think it is difficult because his knowledge is not yet complete." For a period, Guo Binyuan went to Dazhai to learn, following the Iron Girls' Brigade to the fields to catch insects. Unexpectedly, this entomology student who scored 99 out of 100 did not know where to put the insects he caught. The Iron Girls jokingly said, "Throw them on the ground, step on them to kill them? Still want to put them in your mouth?" He deeply felt, "Although book knowledge can get 99 out of 100, this 'three-separation' 99 is worthless in production practice! Only the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, who have practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, are my true teachers!"

Recently, the editorial note of the *Red Flag* magazine pointed out: "For a large number of graduates from colleges and universities who have been working and are currently working, attention should be paid to their re-education, so that they can unite with workers and peasants." The voice of our great leader Chairman Mao greatly encouraged Guo Binyuan, and he decided to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a sense of urgency, firmly and better unite with workers and peasants, honestly accept the leadership of the working class, accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fundamentally change his worldview, become an ordinary laborer, be a cow for the people for life, pull the revolutionary cart for life, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

    走毛主席指引的道路大有作为
    ——记中国科学院微生物研究所顾滨源同志与贫下中农相结合的事迹
    在中国科学院首届活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会上，一位青年科技战士，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，汇报了自己遵循毛主席的教导，与贫下中农相结合，进行思想改造的收获和为贫下中农服务所作出的成绩。他的发言深深打动了到会人的心弦。这位青年科技战士，就是中国科学院微生物研究所的顾滨源同志。
    迈出了第一步
    一九六五年初，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《二十三条》发表了。农村四清运动在毛主席的指引下蓬蓬勃勃地开展着。这时，顾滨源同志重温了毛主席的伟大教导：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”他积极报名要求参加四清工作，决心在与贫下中农的结合中，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中经受锻炼和改造。
    八月的一天，四清工作队来到了山西省运城县大渠公社寺北大队。顾滨源同志住在一位叫田福德的老贫农家里。田福德原是山东人，被地主逼得走投无路，逃荒到了山西运城。他到了运城又给地主扛了整整四十年的长工，受尽了欺凌和剥削。是恩人毛主席解放了田福德，田福德无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱社会主义！
    田大爷象对待自己的孩子那样关怀和照顾着顾滨源同志。有一次，顾滨源同志病了，田大爷急得不得了，连忙找医生给他看病。他发高烧，吃不下饭，田大爷不辞辛劳地跑到很远的小镇子去买烧饼给他吃，还把自己珍藏的治气喘病用的蜂蜜拿给他吃。田大爷总是说：“你们是毛主席派来的，和我们贫下中农是一家人。”贫下中农的深厚的阶级感情，深深地感动了顾滨源同志。
    在和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动的过程中，顾滨源同志才真正学懂了毛主席的这一伟大教导：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”他不由得想起了自己九年前，由于受了资产阶级思想的影响，在中级农校毕业后，一心向往着大城市，向往着成名成家，借着考大学的机会离开了农村。一九六一年大学毕业后，住的是工人盖的高楼大厦，吃的是农民种的大米白面，却没有对国家对人民做出什么贡献。他感到惭愧，觉得对不起毛主席，对不起培养自己的工人农民。
    毛主席说：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”顾滨源同志重温了毛主席的这段教导，暗暗下了决心，要永远走毛主席指引的道路，永远和贫下中农结合在一块，彻底改造自己的世界观，在农村这个广阔的天地里，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献自己的一切。
    急贫下中农之所急
    顾滨源同志反复学习了毛主席的教导：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。……这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决。”他认定了自己前进的方向，就一步一步地走下去了。
    他来寺北二队不久，社员群众正为茄子地闹“土旱”着急。队里种的茄子由绿变黄，眼看就要枯死了。有人说：“干脆拔了它，反正值不了几个钱。”田福德老大爷听了以后拉着顾滨源的胳膊说：“老顾呀！别的菜还没长起来，再过十天就是中秋了，要是拔了它，社员吃啥呢？”顾滨源来到茄子地检查了几片叶子，发现背面有密密麻麻的针尖大的红蜘蛛。原来，“土旱”的秘密在这里。附近的棉花地里也同样有这种害虫。顾滨源心想，棉花地好治，茄子地喷什么药，书本上没看到过，要是用错了药，出了问题谁负责任？算了吧，不冒这个险。但是他转而想起田大爷的话：“社员吃啥呢？”老贫农心里时时刻刻想的是集体，而自己却是想着怕丢面子，怕负责任，这不是和贫下中农相差太远了吗？他经过一番思想斗争，最后下了决心：急贫下中农之所急。
    他当即和贫下中农商量，决定设法消灭红蜘蛛，保护棉花、茄子。他们经过认真分析，选择了一种既能杀虫、毒性又小的农药，当晚组织青少年提灯夜战，很快喷完了药。几天以后茄子由黄返绿，结果又收了三千多斤茄子，不仅解决了本队社员的吃菜问题，而且还拨出去了一千多斤供给市镇居民。社员们说：“不信鬼，不信神，听毛主席的话，信科学道理。”队里很快成立了科学实验小组，从生产实际出发，开展了棉花治虫、毒杀蝼蛄、小麦种子处理、良种栽培等科学实验活动。
    顾滨源同志所在的第二生产队是全公社畜力最差的队，全队一千零五十亩耕地，仅有二十来头役畜，其中有十一头比较瘦弱，每到春耕大忙季节，畜力问题就成了关键问题。饲养员、共产党员赵志刚，早就想改变这种落后面貌，但一直没有找到合适的办法。
    “贫下中农需要什么，我就干什么。”顾滨源同志来到了二队马厩。赵志刚一见老顾来了，非常高兴地说：“你们前一段治虫有办法，能不能想法把牛喂肥一点？”顾滨源没有马上回答。他学习了毛主席的教导：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”他首先来马厩参加劳动，一面仔细观察牲口的健康及生活情况，一面向饲养员请教，终于发现了牲口瘦弱、软骨病多的主要原因是饲草质量不好，作为主要饲料的麦秸，茎秆粗硬不易消化。他想到有人曾经做过碱化稻草喂牲口的试验，我们能不能采用碱化麦秸来喂牲口呢？他把这个想法告诉了二队的干部和饲养员。开始大家有些顾虑。听说碱化草要用石灰，怕母畜吃了不孕，孕畜流产，小牛不长……。这时顾滨源同志就和大家一起学习毛主席关于三大革命运动的指示，同时讲明碱化麦草的好处，赵志刚听了以后立即带领几个小青年，从自己家里搬来石灰、砖头，修起锅台和水池，开始试验。他们先选择了四头有代表性的幼、孕、弱、瘦牛试喂。喂了二十多天，膘情未见显著变化，有的人动摇了。但是共产党员赵志刚却一心想把牲口喂好，毫不动摇地搞试验，使顾滨源受到深刻教育，更加坚定了信心。于是，他们一面研究改进饲养方法，一面学习毛主席的指示：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话，鼓起了大家的勇气，碱化草试验终于坚持下来了。
    农谚说：“牛年马月驴当时”，牛上膘就是慢。三个月后，试验的几头牛起了很大的变化，个个膘肥体壮毛发亮。原来有头母牛整天拉稀，躺下起不来，如今它却变得虎彪彪的，还配了种怀了孕。社员们见到确实有效果，就纷纷要求耕牛全部喂碱化草，不仅喂牛，也喂驴、骡、马，并很快推广到了全大队和全公社。后来，县里又在寺北开了现场会，在全县推广了碱化草饲养的方法。
    一年多的实践证明，碱化草喂牲口效果十分显著。在运城全县，一九六六年牲口纯增百分之十一，是历史上从来没有的最高年。这是农村社会主义教育运动的伟大成果，是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利。
    群众是真正的英雄
    缺肥，这是发展粮棉生产的一个大障碍。
    养猪是解决肥料问题的重要途径，而解决饲料问题，又是发展养猪事业的关键。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“养猪是关系肥料、肉食和出口换取外汇的大问题”。又指出：“猪的饲料是容易解决的，某些青草，某些树叶，番薯藤叶和番薯都是饲料，不一定要精料，尤其不一定要用很多的精料。”
    遵照毛主席的指示，顾滨源着手帮助群众解决这个非常迫切的问题——开辟猪饲料的来源。他深入到群众中多看、多听、多请教。贫下中农说：“猪吃百样草，全凭人去找。”他看到许多社员家里用磨碎的麦糠、玉米芯、红薯蔓、棉花叶、玉米秆、高粱壳等喂猪的办法，得到很大的启发。他体会到只要按毛主席的指示去做，又能紧紧地依靠群众，向群众学习，就一定能够成功。
    他琢磨着既然碱化了的麦草能够喂牛，能不能用它来喂猪呢？虽然它的营养价值比较差，但是来源丰富，如果试验成功，就能为大力发展集体养猪打开一条路。于是就在大队猪场开始了试验。考虑到猪的消化能力，并能引起它的食欲，他们采用把麦秸、豌豆蔓、杂草等粉碎后碱化、发酵的办法进行喂养，同时掺入少量的精饲料。经过试验，这个办法可以节省一部分精饲料，同时改变了几千年来一直认为“猪是吃粮食的张口货”的旧看法。
    为了克服粗饲料中蛋白质含量的不足，他们决定再加进十几个微生物菌种进行试验。他们从北京取来了菌种。为了接种繁殖这些菌种，就用墨水瓶做了消毒用的酒精灯，用白酒代替酒精，在筷子上绑一根废针头，代替接种棒，结果获得了成功。
    接受工农兵的再教育
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一个人从那样的小学一直读到那样的大学，毕业了，算有知识了。但是他有的只是书本上的知识，还没有参加任何实际活动，还没有把自己学得的知识应用到生活的任何部门里去。象这样的人是否可以算得一个完全的知识分子呢？我以为很难，因为他的知识还不完全。”有一段时间，顾滨源到大寨去学习，他跟着铁姑娘队来到地里抓虫子，没想到自己这个昆虫学考了九十九分的大学生，抓了虫子竟不知道往哪儿放。铁姑娘开玩笑似地说：“扔在地上，踩死不就行了吗？还能往嘴里送？”他深有体会地说：“尽管书本知识可以得九十九分，但是这种‘三脱离’的九十九分在生产实践中就显得不值一文！只有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的具有阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动实践经验的广大工、农、兵才是我的真正老师！”
    最近，《红旗》杂志编者按指出：“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。”伟大领袖毛主席的声音，给了顾滨源同志极大的鼓舞，他决心以只争朝夕的精神，落实毛主席的最新指示，坚定不移地、更好地与工农结合起来，老老实实地接受工人阶级的领导，接受工农兵对自己的再教育，使世界观来一个根本的转变，成为一个普通劳动者，当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车，永远跟毛主席干革命。
