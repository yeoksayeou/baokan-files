The old worker Tang Yuheng has boundless love for Chairman Mao, deep hatred for class enemies like the Chinese Khrushchev, enthusiastic support for the revolutionary committee, and resolute opposition to unreasonable systems. He is respected by all the workers in the factory. He truly deserves to be called:

The master of the country

The shift bell has rung for over half an hour, but veteran worker Tang Yuheng is still wandering around the factory. He bends down to gather the fur scraps and pieces of leather that have fallen to the ground; he pushes the doors and windows of the workshop to check if they are closed tightly; he looks at the fire-fighting water barrels and fills them with water...

When it comes to Old Tang, the workers in the factory all admire him. During the days when the capitalist roaders incited a work stoppage, Old Tang remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production." Despite being ill, he walked more than ten miles to work every day, arriving early and leaving late, and with his actions of overproducing every month, he refuted the enemy. After the revolutionary committee was established, he was overjoyed and poured his boundless love for Chairman Mao into the new revolutionary committee. When the revolutionary committee was first established, class enemies tried every means to sabotage it. Old Tang faced the storm of struggle, standing on the front line of class struggle, defending the new revolutionary regime. He and the old workers in his team encouraged the members of the revolutionary committee, saying: "With Chairman Mao backing us and the workers supporting you, you should bravely command the battle!" When some members of the revolutionary committee relaxed their ideological revolution and went to the workshops less often, he said: "Chairman Mao teaches us to connect with the masses, this is the most fundamental thing, you should go down and listen to the workers' opinions."

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction that the working class is the leading class was issued, Old Tang couldn't sit still. He found the members of the revolutionary committee and said: "The proletarian headquarters has issued orders, the revolutionary committee's steps in the struggle, criticism, and reform are too small."

Old Tang's criticism was well-founded. The matter goes back to 1965. That year, the new factory director, now a capitalist roader, implemented the "outside processing" system, which was actually a variant of the "small contract" system. Workers labored in the factory during the day and took work home at night, earning an extra wage, thereby increasing production. One day, under his wife's urging, Old Tang also took a few pieces of leather home. The old couple sewed all night. But the next day, Old Tang's waist ached and his head throbbed, and he couldn't muster the spirit to work. On his way home, he carried his weary body and pondered this matter, the more he thought about it, the more he felt he couldn't do it!

After dinner, Old Tang called his wife to his side and said excitedly: "For the sake of earning more wages, harming the state, this is not what our working class should do!"

When it came to the "state," memories flooded his mind. He clearly remembered that it was this pair of hands that couldn't even feed a family in the old society. Relatives died, and there wasn't even money to buy a funeral mat; borrowing from the capitalist boss, the heartless boss didn't lend a single copper coin. Thinking of the bitter past, he was filled with anger and tears, saying: "At that time, the state was ruled by wolves, how could there be a way out for the poor!" Hearing Old Tang's words, his wife's eyes also filled with tears, saying excitedly: "We can't be tempted by this stinking money!"

The old couple thought of Zhang Zide, thought of Norman Bethune, and facing Chairman Mao's portrait, they said with deep affection: "Chairman Mao! It is you who fought for us poor people to build a socialist country and live a good life. How can we, for our own sake, harm the interests of the state and undermine the foundations of socialism?"

The next day, Old Tang brought his wife and his opinions to the factory and rushed to the director's office. With great enthusiasm, he talked to the "director" about his understanding of "outside processing," hoping that the "director" would adopt his suggestions. But the reply he got was: "As long as it can overproduce, any method is fine!" Hearing this, Old Tang was so angry that he felt his lungs would burst. He knew the "director's" temper, and it was useless to say more, so he angrily strode out of the "director's" office...

That night, Old Tang couldn't sleep. Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work" gave him boundless fighting strength. From then on, he no longer took work home, coming to work early and leaving late every day, working hard to overproduce. His actions gained the support of the workers in his team. This enraged the "director," who used the shackles of the inspection system to restrain him, but how could he restrain the red heart of a worker loyal to Chairman Mao? He still overproduced every day and saved every month.

The great tide of the Cultural Revolution washed away all the filth, and the revolutionary criticism further raised his awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. He hated the Chinese Khrushchev and all the big and small class enemies! Countless nights, he looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait with boundless admiration and respect, raising his arm to swear: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I will be loyal to you for life, and I will steadfastly follow the course you point out!"

After the factory revolutionary committee was established, Old Tang proposed to abolish this "outside processing" system. Due to the busy work of cleaning up the class ranks at that time, this matter was put aside.

Old Tang and other worker comrades criticized the revolutionary committee, and the revolutionary committee immediately accepted this opinion, fully mobilizing the masses to launch a revolutionary criticism, abolishing this system that harmed the state.

    老工人唐玉恒对毛主席无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫等阶级敌人无比仇恨，对革委会热情支持，对不合理制度坚决反对，受到全厂职工的尊敬。他真不愧是：
    国家的主人
    下班铃已打过半个多小时了，可是老师傅唐玉恒还在厂里转来转去。他一忽儿弯腰归拢归拢割出来的皮毛帽扇，拾拾掉在地上的碎皮子；一忽儿推推车间的门窗，检查是否关严实了；一忽儿瞅瞅防火水缸，提起水桶往里装水……
    提起老唐师傅，厂里的职工都很敬佩他。在走资派煽动停工停产的日子里，老唐师傅牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，每天带病走十几里路上班，早来晚走，以月月超产的实际行动，回击敌人。革委会成立后，他乐得合不拢嘴，把对毛主席的无限热爱，倾注在新生的革委会身上。革委会成立之初，阶级敌人千方百计要破坏革委会。老唐师傅迎着斗争的风雨，站在阶级斗争的第一线，捍卫着新生的革命政权。他和班组里的老工人，鼓励革委会成员说：“有毛主席撑腰，有我们工人支持，你们要勇敢地指挥战斗！”当革委会有的成员放松了思想革命化，下车间少了，他就说：“毛主席教导我们要联系群众，这是最根本的一条，你们应该下去听听工人的意见。”
    毛主席关于工人阶级是领导阶级的最新指示发表后，老唐师傅坐不住了。他找到革委会同志说：“无产阶级司令部已发出了号令，革委会在斗、批、改方面步子迈得太小了。”
    老唐师傅的批评，是有根据的。事情要从一九六五年说起。那年新来的厂长、现在的走资派，推行了“厂外加工”制，实际是“小包工”制度的变种。工人白天在厂里劳动一天，晚上还把活拿回家里做，再拿一份工资，以此来提高产量。老唐师傅在老伴的催促下，有一天也往家拿了几件皮子，老两口缝了大半夜。可是第二天老唐师傅腰也酸、脑也胀，怎么也提不起精神来，活干得少了。回家的路上，他带着疲乏的身子，心里琢磨着这件事，越琢磨越觉得干不得！
    吃罢晚饭，老唐师傅把老伴叫到身边，激动地说：“为了自己多拿工资，坑害国家，这不是咱们工人阶级干的呀！”
    提起“国家”，往事涌上心头。他清楚地记得，也是这双手，在旧社会却养不活一家人。亲人死去，连买席子的钱都没有；向资本家借，狠心的老板连一个铜子也不借给。想起辛酸的往事，他满腔怒火，满脸泪水，愤懑地说：“那时的国家，豺狼掌权，那能有咱穷人的出路！”听了老唐师傅的话，老伴也泪水盈眶，激动地说：“咱们不能希罕这几个臭钱！”老两口想起张思德，想起白求恩，面对毛主席的像，无限深情地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您老人家为咱穷人打出了社会主义江山，过上了好日子，咱们怎能为了自己，损害国家的利益，挖社会主义墙脚呢？”
    第二天，老唐师傅带着老伴和自己的意见，一进厂就奔向厂长办公室，满腔热情地向“厂长”谈出自己对“厂外加工”的认识，满以为“厂长”能够采纳他的意见，那里想到得到的回答是：“只要能超产，啥办法都行嘛！”听了这话，老唐师傅肺都要气炸了，他知道“厂长”的脾气，再说也无济于事，于是愤然大步走出“厂长”办公室……
    这天晚上老唐师傅怎么也睡不着，毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导给了他无穷的战斗力量。从此，他再也不往家拿活了，每天早来晚归，拚命地超产。他的行动，得到了班里工人们的支持。这可激怒了“厂长”，就用检查制度的枷锁来卡他，但是，怎能卡得住工人阶级忠于毛主席的一颗红心呢？他仍然天天超产，月月节约。
    文化大革命的洪流，荡涤着一切污泥浊水，革命的大批判进一步提高了他的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。他恨透了中国赫鲁晓夫，恨透了这些大大小小的阶级敌人！不知有多少个夜晚，他怀着无限敬仰、无限崇敬的心情，仰望着毛主席像振臂宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！我一辈子忠于您，一辈子坚定不移地沿着您指引的航向前进！
    厂革委会成立后，老唐师傅就提出要改掉这个“厂外加工”制度，由于当时忙于清理阶级队伍，就把这件事搁下来了。
    老唐师傅和其他工人同志，对革委会提出了批评意见以后，革委会立即接受了这个意见，充分发动群众，开展了一场革命大批判，取消了这个坑害国家的“厂外加工”制度。
