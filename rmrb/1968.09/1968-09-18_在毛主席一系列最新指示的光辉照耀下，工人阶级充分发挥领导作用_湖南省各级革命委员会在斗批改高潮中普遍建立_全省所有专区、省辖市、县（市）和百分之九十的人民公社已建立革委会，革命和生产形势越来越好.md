Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class is fully playing a leading role. In Hunan Province, revolutionary committees have been universally established during the campaign of struggle, criticism, and transformation. All special districts, municipalities directly under the province, counties (cities), and 90% of the people's communes in the province have established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary and production situations are getting better and better.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 17th - Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all ten special districts, two municipalities directly under the province, and 93 counties (cities) of Hunan Province. Ninety percent of rural people's communes have also established revolutionary committees. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Currently, a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is forming throughout the province. The revolutionary and production situations are unprecedentedly good and getting better and better.

"The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class and the broad revolutionary masses of Hunan Province have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, waged a heroic struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agent in Hunan, Wang Yanchun, and achieved one victory after another. In April this year, the provincial revolutionary committee was established. Reviewing the more than two-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class and the broad revolutionary masses of the entire province have deeply felt that following Chairman Mao means victory. After the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in Hunan Province, they have placed the task of leading the broad revolutionary people of the entire province to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held more and more frequently and better and better. According to statistics, the number of people participating in study classes has reached more than 18 million. The rapid implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has promoted the victorious development of the revolution and production in the entire province.

The revolutionary criticism throughout Hunan Province is being carried out vigorously. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad revolutionary people have launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan, and have closely combined the criticism with the cleanup of class ranks, striking a small handful of class enemies accurately and resolutely, and consolidating the newly established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary people of the entire province are closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unifying their understanding, steps, and actions, and bravely fighting for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." The working class of Hunan Province, which is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, is following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. Currently, large numbers of working-class Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have been formed throughout the province and have marched into schools and other units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out. In the countryside, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and actively participating in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The great victories in the revolutionary struggle have powerfully promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. Although Hunan Province has suffered severe droughts and floods this year, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels, the broad masses of workers and peasants have united as one, vigorously carried out disaster relief work, and made the output of early and middle-season rice in most regions increase. Late-season rice and other grain crops are also in prospect for a bumper harvest. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants are enthusiastically delivering grain to the state, and the amount of grain purchased and stored by the province has increased by more than 60% compared to the same period last year. The industrial and transportation fronts are also in a good situation. The production of many industrial and mining enterprises in the province has risen significantly, and everywhere is a bustling scene. The broad revolutionary people of the entire province are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，工人阶级充分发挥领导作用
    湖南省各级革命委员会在斗批改高潮中普遍建立
    全省所有专区、省辖市、县（市）和百分之九十的人民公社已建立革委会，革命和生产形势越来越好
    新华社长沙十七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，湖南省十个专区、两个省辖市、九十三个县（市），已经全部成立革命委员会。百分之九十的农村人民公社也建立了革命委员会。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。目前，在全省范围内，一个斗、批、改高潮正在形成，革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”湖南省的工人阶级和广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人王延春之流，进行了英勇的斗争，取得了一个又一个巨大胜利，今年四月建立了省革命委员会。回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，全省工人阶级和广大革命群众深刻体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利。湖南省各级革命委员会建立以后，把带领全省广大革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示放在一切工作的首位。全省各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。据统计，参加学习班的人数，已达到一千八百多万人次。毛主席一系列最新指示的迅速落实，推动了全省革命和生产的胜利发展。
    湖南全省的革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。广大革命人民在毛主席革命路线的指引下，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人展开了深入、持久的革命大批判，并且把大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，巩固了新生的革命委员会。全省革命人民紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而英勇战斗。
    毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的湖南省工人阶级，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。目前，全省已经组成了大批的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进学校和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。在农村，广大贫下中农认真落实毛主席最新指示，积极投入了斗、批、改高潮。
    革命斗争的巨大胜利，有力地促进了工农业生产的发展。今年湖南省虽然遭到了严重水旱灾害，由于广大工农群众在各级革命委员会领导下，团结一致，大力开展了抗灾、救灾工作，使绝大多数地区的早、中稻产量都有所增长。晚稻和其他粮食作物也丰收在望。广大贫下中农踊跃向国家交售粮食，全省征购入库的粮食比去年同期增长百分之六十以上。工业交通战线也是形势大好，全省不少工矿企业单位的生产都大幅度上升，到处是一派蓬蓬勃勃的大好景象。全省广大革命人民决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
