The U.S. imperialists' ambition to occupy South Vietnam and split the Vietnamese nation will not change. To achieve this goal, while further expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, they are also hatching plots for negotiations. The Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique is collaborating with them, attempting to make the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war come to a halt. The Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique has long been the number one accomplice of U.S. aggression against Vietnam. However, even if the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists join forces, they cannot save the U.S. aggressors from their inevitable defeat in Vietnam. Their arrogant attempts to collude and redivide the world are facing increasingly strong resistance from the people of all countries. The more the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists collude, the more the people of the world see that they are birds of a feather.

The heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have achieved great victories in the anti-U.S. national salvation war. This is the result of the Vietnamese people's fearlessness of sacrifice, arduous struggle, perseverance in people's war, and unyielding struggle against the U.S. imperialists who are bent on aggression. The victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war have made a contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism.

The situation of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war is excellent. Although there will still be various difficulties and twists and turns on the road ahead, we are deeply convinced that the 31 million Vietnamese people, who have been tempered by war, will certainly achieve the final victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war as long as they carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution and persist in protracted war.

The 700 million Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-U.S. national salvation war through to the end!

Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

    毛主席林副主席周总理热烈电贺越南民主共和国独立二十三周年
    美帝国主义霸占越南南方、分割越南民族的野心是不会改变的。为了达到这个目的，它在进一步扩大侵越战争的同时，大搞和谈阴谋。苏联现代修正主义领导集团从中配合，力图使越南人民的抗美救国战争半途而废。苏联现代修正主义领导集团早已成为美帝侵略越南的头号帮凶。但是，美帝、苏修加在一起，也挽救不了美国侵略者在越南必然失败的命运。它们互相勾结、重新瓜分世界的狂妄企图，正在遭到各国人民越来越强烈的反抗。美帝、苏修越是勾结在一起，世界人民就越看清楚他们是一丘之貉。
    久经战争考验的三千一百万越南人民，只要发扬彻底革命精神，坚持持久战争，必将取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。七亿中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    新华社一日讯　中国人民的伟大领袖、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友、中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志以及国务院总理周恩来同志，今天打电报给越南劳动党中央委员会主席、越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志等越南党政领导人，热烈祝贺越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年。电报全文如下：河内越南劳动党中央委员会主席、越南民主共和国主席
  胡志明同志，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征同志，越南民主共和国政府总理范文同同志：
    在越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年的时候，我们代表中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，向越南人民、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府致以最热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的越南人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下，在抗美救国战争中取得了伟大的胜利。这是越南人民不怕牺牲，艰苦奋斗，坚持人民战争，同侵略成性的美帝国主义进行针锋相对斗争的结果。越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利，为世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争作出了贡献。
    美帝国主义霸占越南南方、分割越南民族的野心是不会改变的。为了达到这个目的，它在进一步扩大侵越战争的同时，大搞和谈阴谋。苏联现代修正主义领导集团从中配合，力图使越南人民的抗美救国战争半途而废。苏联现代修正主义领导集团早已成为美帝侵略越南的头号帮凶。
    但是，美帝、苏修加在一起，也挽救不了美国侵略者在越南必然失败的命运。它们互相勾结、重新瓜分世界的狂妄企图，正在遭到各国人民越来越强烈的反抗。美帝、苏修越是勾结在一起，世界人民就越看清楚他们是一丘之貉。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的形势大好。在前进的道路上，尽管还会遇到各种各样的困难和曲折，但是，我们深信，久经战争考验的三千一百万越南人民，只要发扬彻底革命精神，坚持持久战争，必将取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    七亿中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    中越两国人民之间的战斗友谊万岁！
