The transportation workers of North Vietnam, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call for a decisive battle and victory over American aggressors, have braved hardships and sacrifices, risking enemy bombing and shelling to transport supplies to the front lines and to areas where production and people's lives are most in need. They have made tremendous contributions to the anti-American national salvation struggle.

The transportation lines of North Vietnam have become iron lines that enemy planes cannot bomb and destroy. Although American imperialism has dispatched bandit planes to bomb North Vietnam day and night, dropping large quantities of bombs on roads, bridges, and ferries, and placing mines in rivers to attack trucks, trains, and ships, the American bombs cannot intimidate the heroic transportation workers. They have put forward slogans such as "Rather shed blood and sacrifice, never let the transportation be interrupted" and "Every bullet transported to the front line means one more enemy killed."

The reporter has seen, both during the day and at night, the tenacious struggle of road repair workers, youth shock brigades, and agricultural cooperative members. As soon as the enemy planes finish bombing, they immediately fill in the bomb craters and repair the roads. The reporter has also seen convoys of trucks loaded with supplies rushing to the front lines amidst the roar of enemy planes. If one section of the road is bombed, a new section is quickly built; if a bridge or ferry is destroyed, a new bridge or ferry appears. Statistics show that from February 7, 1965, when American bandit planes began large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, to the end of June 1967, in addition to newly built mountain roads, rural roads alone totaled 107,000 kilometers.

The drivers, helmsmen, and ferry workers in the transportation sector, unafraid of hardships and sacrifices, have done everything possible to increase the number of trips, tons transported, and ensure safe transportation to complete their tasks.

The 8th Automobile Team in Quang Binh Province has taken many measures to improve transportation efficiency. As a result, despite the intensified bombing by American bandit planes in the first half of this year, many drivers in the team have achieved a monthly transportation rate of 30 days, and the entire team has overfulfilled the first half-year's transportation task. Automobile transportation units in Nam Dinh, Hanoi, and other places frequently go to the most heavily bombed areas and have completed their tasks well. A team leader, Do Van Ngu, has safely driven 50,000 kilometers. Once, he was blown into a river by a bomb blast and injured in multiple places, but he crawled out of the river to rescue the truck. Driver Bui Ngoc Sung has been fighting in the most heavily bombed areas for half a year and has consistently overfulfilled his tasks. His team has been attacked by enemy planes 40 times, and once Bui Ngoc Sung was injured but still bravely drove the truck forward.

The youth shock brigades and agricultural cooperative members who maintain the roads have also played a significant role in ensuring the smooth flow of transportation. When roads are bombed, agricultural cooperative members immediately mobilize to assist youth shock brigades and road repair workers in quickly repairing the roads. Many elderly people and children plant trees or bananas on both sides of the roads to camouflage them. Many agricultural cooperatives prepare stones and soil blocks on both sides of the roads for road repair. In the provinces of Vinh Phuc, Quang Binh, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh, where enemy planes bomb the most intensely, almost every family has materials ready for road and bridge repair.

Under the great support of the people, the broad masses of workers on the transportation lines have withstood the severe test of war. They have expressed their determination to thoroughly defeat American imperialism, liberate the South, and reunify the country.

A youth shock brigade member told the reporter, "We youth shock brigade members resolutely respond to Chairman Ho's battle call, unafraid of hardships and sacrifices, and ensure the smooth flow of transportation lines." Another brigade member said, "The American aggressors talk about 'peace' to deceive world public opinion and weaken our fighting will. We will fight to the end until there is not a single American devil left in the South."

### 越南交通线已成为钢铁运输线

    不怕美帝狂轰滥炸  保证交通线畅通无阻  
    越南交通线已成为钢铁运输线
    新华社河内二日电　本社记者报道：越南北方交通运输部门的职工，响应胡志明主席的决战决胜美国侵略强盗的战斗号召，不畏艰苦牺牲，冒着敌机轰炸和炮击的危险，把物资运送到前线，运送到生产和人民生活最需要的地方去，在抗美救国斗争中作出了巨大贡献。
    越南北方的交通运输线已成了敌机炸不断的钢铁运输线。虽然美帝国主义派遣强盗飞机不分白天黑夜地狂轰滥炸越南北方，向公路、桥梁、渡口投下大量的炸弹，向河流投放水雷，对汽车、火车、船只等进行疯狂的袭击，但是，美国的炸弹吓不倒英雄的交通运输战线上的广大职工。他们提出了“宁可流血牺牲，决不让交通中断”，“多运到前线一发炮弹，就是多消灭一个敌人”等豪迈口号。
    记者不仅在白天而且在夜间行车时，都曾多次看到修路工人、青年突击队员和农业社员们的顽强战斗情景。当狂轰滥炸的敌机刚刚离开，他们就立刻填平弹坑，补平路面；也曾看到，一队队满载物资的汽车，就在敌机盘旋吼叫声中奔赴前线。一段公路被炸坏了，新的一段立刻会修筑起来；一座桥、一个渡口被炸坏了，新的桥、新的渡口又会出现。据统计，从一九六五年二月七日美国强盗飞机大规模轰炸越南北方起，到一九六七年六月底止，除新建的翻山越岭的公路以外，仅农村新建的公路就长达十万七千公里。
    交通运输部门的司机、舵工、渡船工人等，不怕艰苦牺牲，为完成运输任务，千方百计地设法增加运输次数、吨数和保证安全运输。
    广平省第八汽车队，为了提高运输效率，采取了许多措施，从而保证今年上半年在美国强盗飞机轰炸比过去更加激烈的情况下，许多小队司机的每月运输日达到了三十天，整个车队超额完成了今年上半年的运输任务。南河、河内等地的汽车运输单位，经常前往轰炸最激烈的地区，都良好地完成了任务。某汽车队小队长团文月已安全行车五万公里。有一次他被炸弹气浪掀到河里去，身上多处受伤，但他顽强地从河里爬上来抢救汽车。司机裴玉嵩半年来战斗在轰炸最激烈的地区，一贯超额完成任务。他所在的车队曾遭到敌机四十次袭击，有一次裴玉嵩被炸伤，但仍勇敢地驾驶汽车前进。
    维护公路的青年突击队员、农业社员，在保证交通线畅通无阻方面也起到了重大的作用。当公路被炸后，农业社员立即出动，协助青年突击队员、修路工人，及时把公路修好。许多老人和少年儿童，在公路两旁植树或种香蕉，来伪装公路。许多农业社在公路两旁准备好石头、泥块，以备修路之用。在永灵、广平、河静、义安等省敌机轰炸最激烈的地区，几乎所有社员家里都备有修路、修桥的材料。
    在人民大力支援下的交通运输线上的广大职工，经受住了战火的严峻考验，他们表示坚决彻底战胜美帝国主义，解放南方，统一祖国。
    某青年突击队员对记者说：“我们青年突击队员坚决响应胡主席的战斗号召，不怕艰苦牺牲，保证交通线畅通无阻。”另一个突击队员说：“美国侵略者口谈‘和平’，目的是欺骗世界舆论，软化我们的战斗意志。我们坚决打到底，直到南方没有一个美国鬼子为止。”
