The survey report by the *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine titled "The Education Revolution in the Countryside Must Rely on the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants" and the editorial note in *Red Flag* magazine have expressed the sentiments of us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Upon hearing the broadcast, we immediately convened a meeting and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" Everyone said: This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and greatest encouragement for all the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students of the Water Source Commune.

Looking back, the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the revisionist educational line has caused us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, great suffering. In recent years, our brigade has had many junior high school and primary school graduates, but after graduating and returning to the production team, some of them do not want to participate in agricultural production. Some young people, whose ancestors were all poor and lower-middle peasants, look down on the poor and lower-middle peasants after graduating from junior high school. Rural-born and raised youth, after graduating from junior high school, do not know how to farm. The poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing the changes in their children, painfully said: "The more you study, the worse you get. One year in the countryside, two years in the city, three years you don't recognize your parents." Even more infuriating is that in the past, schools valued grades over people, and people over class, setting up hurdle after hurdle for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter and advance in school, excluding a large number of poor and lower-middle peasant children from the school gates. In our brigade, out of 610 poor and lower-middle peasant youths, 480 have not graduated from primary school. The eighth production team has one university graduate and two high school graduates, all of whom are the children of landlords and rich peasants, with none from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The fifth team leader, Shi Dianpeng, whose family has not had anyone attend school for four generations, planned to let his children study more after liberation, but the "grades first" barrier of the revisionist educational line blocked his children's path. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: In the past, it was the landlords who did not let us study; now it is the Chinese Khrushchev who does not let us study.

Recently, Chairman Mao taught us: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao has spoken the words in our hearts. This is the greatest concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao is supporting us, and we must strive for Chairman Mao. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our Water Source Brigade Revolutionary Committee has strengthened its leadership over the schools. In May of this year, I and the poor and lower-middle peasant representative Xin Deshan, together with revolutionary teachers and students in the school, formed the Education Revolution Committee. The Education Revolution Committee, entrusted by the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasps the educational power. Our primary task is to fully implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line without any deviation, to lead the school with Mao Zedong Thought, to reform the teachers' worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, to arm the students with Mao Zedong Thought, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the education revolution. After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the schools, they made studying and applying Chairman Mao's works the main course, strengthened class education, frequently invited poor and lower-middle peasants who had suffered deeply in the old society to recall bitterness and think of sweetness for teachers and students, invited the brigade's public security chief to lecture on class struggle, invited militia instructors and demobilized soldiers to teach military courses, and invited old farmers to teach agricultural technology courses. This truly ensures that every poor and lower-middle peasant cares about education and the cultivation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The students frequently participate in the brigade's class struggle, thus rapidly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for class enemies. The school is run in a lively and vibrant manner and is highly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They say: The school we have longed for day and night has been established after we grasped the educational power. In the future, we will definitely manage the school well and cultivate more successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    贫下中农真正掌握了教育大权
    辽宁营口县水源公社水源大队革命委员会副主任、教育革命委员会副主任  刘荣久
  《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志调查员《农村的教育革命必须依靠贫下中农》的调查报告和《红旗》杂志的编者按，说出了我们广大贫下中农的心里话。贫下中农一听到广播，立刻召开了大会，热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”大家说：这是毛主席对我们水源公社全体贫下中农和学校革命师生的最大关怀和最大鞭策。
    回想过去，中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线，可把我们贫下中农害苦了。我们大队几年来有不少中学和高小毕业生，可是他们有的毕业回生产队后，却不愿参加农业生产。有的青年祖祖辈辈是贫下中农，中学毕业后瞧不起贫下中农。农村生、农村长的青年一代，初中毕业后不会种地。贫下中农看到自己子女的这个变化，痛心地说：“你们是越念越糟，一年土，二年洋，三年不认爹和娘”。更叫人气愤的是：过去学校认分不认人，认人不认阶级，给贫下中农子女入学和升学设下了一道道的关卡，把大批贫下中农子女排斥在学校大门以外，我们大队六百一十名贫下中农青年中，高小没有毕业的就有四百八十名。第八生产队有一个大学生，两个高中生，都是地主、富农的子女，贫下中农一个没有。第五队队长史殿朋，祖孙四代没念书，解放后本打算让子女多念几年书，但修正主义教育路线“分数第一”的关口把他的孩子卡住了。广大贫下中农说：过去是地主不让我们念书，现在是中国赫鲁晓夫不让我们念书。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们贫下中农的最大关怀。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们水源大队革命委员会加强了对学校的领导。今年五月，让我和贫下中农代表辛德善，同学校中的革命教师和革命学生组成教育革命委员会。教育革命委员会受贫下中农的委托，掌握教育大权。我们最主要的任务，就是不折不扣地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，用毛泽东思想领导好学校，用毛泽东思想改造教师的世界观，用毛泽东思想武装学生，在学校中全面落实毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示。贫下中农管理学校以后，把活学活用毛主席著作做为教学的主课，并加强了阶级教育课，经常请旧社会里苦大仇深的贫下中农给师生忆苦思甜，请大队治保主任讲阶级斗争，请民兵指导员、复员军人讲军事课，请老农讲农业技术课，真正做到贫下中农人人关心教育，关心培养无产阶级革命事业接班人。学生呢，则经常参加大队的阶级斗争，这样，学生们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提高得很快，他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对阶级敌人无比仇恨。学校办得生动活泼，很受贫下中农的欢迎，他们说：我们日夜盼、天天想的学校，在我们掌握了教育大权以后建立起来了。今后，我们一定把学校管好，培养更多的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。（新华社）
