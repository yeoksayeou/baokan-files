Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of our country (except Taiwan Province). The entire country is red. The billion military and civilian people enthusiastically cheer the great victory of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically cheer the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, and complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The working class must lead everything. Under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class has taken the stage for the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. The representatives of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University, who were personally received by Chairman Mao, are determined to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, strive to improve their political consciousness, participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school, and forever lead the school.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further inspired the people of all nationalities in our country with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is the old man Kurban Tulumu of the Uyghur nationality in Xinjiang, who was received by Chairman Mao, studying Chairman Mao's works with everyone.

Long live the revolutionary committees! The revolutionary committee of Lingbao County, Henan Province, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, has streamlined the bureaucracy, maintained close ties with the masses, and established a new revolutionary style. This is Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Liu Shangxiu going deep into the remote Chengzhuang Commune, holding a Mao Zedong Thought study class with poor and lower-middle-class peasant community members, and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

After sending many outstanding workers to participate in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the workers at the Anti-Imperialist Mine in Liaoyuan, Jilin, have been focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production, completing their production tasks ahead of schedule. This is the revolutionary workers of the Anti-Imperialist Mine No. 1 reporting their good news to the revolutionary committee via telephone underground, expressing their loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals, revolutionary technical personnel from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have been leaving their offices and going to the production frontlines, learning from workers, receiving re-education from the working class, and promoting their own ideological transformation. The picture shows revolutionary technical personnel and workers assembling machinery together.

In response to Chairman Mao's great call, a large number of Red Guards enthusiastically rushed to the countryside and factories. This is Li Yonghong, a sent-down youth (left), studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with community members during a rest in the field.

The revolutionary upsurge is promoting a production upsurge. Through the efforts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle-class peasants, this year's agricultural production in our country is another bumper harvest. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The picture shows the poor and lower-middle-class peasants of Jiaoquan Commune, Chengguan Brigade, Linqu County, Shandong Province, enthusiastically handing over their bumper harvest grain to the state with boundless love for Chairman Mao.
