With the resolute support of the broad masses of the people, the more than 120 political prisoners who were illegally detained in the Malaya Muar and Taiping concentration camps ended their brave hunger strike of over 20 days. The "Malaysia" Rahman puppet clique was forced to accept most of their demands. These political prisoners ended their hunger strike on the 11th.

According to reports from Singapore newspapers, the political prisoners in the Muar and Taiping concentration camps began their hunger strike on August 16th and 22nd, respectively, to protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Rahman puppet clique, the running dogs of US and British imperialism, against the people of Malaya.

During this period, political parties, trade unions, families of political prisoners, and the masses of the people in Malaya took various actions, issued statements, and held demonstrations and marches. They resolutely supported the just struggle of the political prisoners and strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by the Rahman puppet clique in its mad persecution of the revolutionary people of Malaya.
