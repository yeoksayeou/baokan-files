Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also constantly raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle." After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we were so moved that we shed tears of joy. Chairman Mao is close to our hearts. Chairman Mao's trust in the working class is the greatest encouragement and the greatest spur to us.

Every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been achieved under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. In the course of class struggle, criticism, and reform in our factory, our knitting workshop carried out a revolution in labor management, breaking away from the past practice of "individual contracts" under the slogan of "bonus as the guiding principle." We achieved a great alliance of proletarian politics in driving the machines. In this struggle, we constantly raised our political consciousness.

In industry, the Chinese Khrushchev promoted the revisionist line of "material incentives" and "bonus as the guiding principle," attempting to corrupt and disintegrate the ranks of the working class. The capitalist roaders in our factory, following the orders of their masters, pushed hard for material incentives, using bonuses to lure us. In our workshop, they long implemented the method of driving machines by allocating them to individuals, setting production quotas for quantity, quality, and consumption, and distributing bonuses according to the fulfillment of these quotas. We called this practice "contracting production to households" in industry. They used a few filthy lucre to stir up discord among the workers, creating various contradictions, each fending for themselves in the face of difficulties, not cooperating in production, not sharing experiences, and no one to drive the machines when they stopped. On the surface, they talked about "politics first," but in reality, they believed that everything would be fine as long as production was good. This was to push the workers onto the capitalist road, attempting to turn proletarian-conscious workers into selfish individuals; to turn the fraternal relations of the working class into the filthy money relations of the bourgeoisie, and to serve as "living tools" for their restoration of capitalism. How poisonous!

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The working class is the leading class, the master of the state. We work hard to produce for the construction of socialism, to support the world revolution, not for a few filthy lucre. We workers hate the Chinese Khrushchev's line. In the past, many comrades did not want to participate in the evaluation of bonuses, and some even refused to attend the evaluation meetings. In 1958, inspired by the Great Leap Forward, our workshop broke away from the unreasonable system and conducted a trial of collective driving. Everyone was very enthusiastic. However, the power was in the hands of the capitalist roaders within the factory. They clung to the revisionist line, using the excuse that responsibilities were unclear and bonuses could not be evaluated, and forcibly suppressed this new thing that had just emerged. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we rebelled against the capitalist roaders within the party, seized the power of the factory, and the workers truly became the masters. Only then was there a reliable guarantee for running and managing the factory according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Our workshop has long had the "difficult problem" of having fewer people and heavier tasks, and many machines standing idle. Last year, for a period, due to the sabotage of class enemies and the influence of anarchist thoughts, this contradiction became more pronounced. What should we do? This was a question everyone thought about every day. We used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fiercely criticized the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and smashed the revisionist management system. The comrades of the Class C machine group responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and first proposed the initiative to drive machines collectively as a group. This initiative, with the strong support of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the stationed soldiers, began to be gradually promoted throughout the workshop starting from last October.

After achieving collective driving, personnel were uniformly allocated, mutual cooperation and assistance were promoted, and the past situation of each person fending for themselves was broken. All the idle machines were started up. After collective driving, we reported to Chairman Mao before and after each shift, organized "Daily Reading" spontaneously, and studied Chairman Mao's works actively, promoting the revolutionization of thoughts and ensuring that proletarian politics guided business. In the past, the capitalist roaders used control, suppression, and restriction to deal with workers, but we did not buy it; now we take the People's Liberation Army as an example, vigorously promoting the "Three-Eight Style," consciously enhancing revolutionary organizational discipline, and establishing the thought of driving for the revolution and being responsible to the people. In the past, some drivers were afraid of producing defective products and not getting bonuses, and there were conflicts between drivers and inspectors; now, if a long defect point appears in the weaving, they voluntarily record it on a card. The relationship between people has changed greatly, forming a fighting collective. Collective driving also promoted the revolutionization of management work. In the past, workshop management personnel went in circles in personnel allocation and task arrangement, but now they are freed from trivial matters and can better do political and ideological work, having more time to participate in production labor. Collective driving promoted the development of production, saved labor, reduced machine downtime, improved machine operating rates, increased production, and ensured quality.

At the end of July this year, our factory responded to Chairman Mao's call and sent many workers to form Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to universities. At that time, class enemies spread rumors saying, "The Knitting Factory has stopped production!" Attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, they really made us furious. In fact, we demonstrated our sky-high revolutionary spirit, with one person doing the work of several, not stopping a single machine, fully demonstrating the superiority of collective driving. The whole factory not only did not stop production but also overfulfilled the task, giving the class enemies a resounding slap in the face.

The process of achieving and consolidating collective driving is a process of struggle against class enemies. In the course of class struggle, criticism, and reform, through the cleanup of class ranks, we exposed class enemies who sabotaged collective driving, raising everyone's class consciousness. At the same time, it is a process of struggling against the "self" in our minds. Some comrades were not used to collective driving, fearing chaos and fatigue, and wanting to restore the old ways. Aiming at the existing active thoughts, we carried out "criticize self, criticize revisionism" and actively studied and applied the "Old Three Articles." Everyone realized that collective driving manifested the spirit of collectivism and was a red flower shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and forever drive for the proletarian revolution.

Following Chairman Mao is victory, being loyal to Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness. We workers are most loyal to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions speak the words of our working class. Chairman Mao supports the working class, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. The whole factory is launching a high tide of studying and fully implementing the latest instructions. We are determined to shoulder the heavy burdens of revolution and production, further carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    听毛主席的话，为无产阶级革命开车
    北京针织总厂工人　赵树增　李景霞
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”学了毛主席的指示，我们激动得掉下了热泪。毛主席和我们心连心，毛主席这样信任工人阶级，是对我们最大的鼓舞、最大的鞭策。
    无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下取得的。在我厂斗、批、改的过程中，我们针织车间，对劳动管理进行了革命，打破以往奖金挂帅的“单干”现象，实现了无产阶级政治挂帅的大联合开车。在这场斗争中，也不断提高了自己的政治觉悟。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在工业中推行“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等一套散发着铜臭的修正主义路线，妄图腐蚀、瓦解工人阶级的队伍。我厂的走资派，秉承其主子的黑指示，大搞物质刺激，用奖金引诱我们。在我们车间，长期推行按人分机台开车的办法，规定产品的数量、质量和消耗指标，完成指标的分等给奖金。我们把这种货色，叫做工业上的“包产到户”。他们用几个臭钱，挑动工人不和，给工人制造种种矛盾，遇到困难各顾各，生产上互相不协作，有了经验不公开，停了车子没人开，表面上也说什么要“政治好”，实际上，生产好就一切都好。搞这一套，就是要把工人往资本主义邪路上推，妄图把有无产阶级觉悟的工人，演变成自私自利的小人；把工人阶级的阶级友爱关系，变成资产阶级肮脏的金钱关系，为他们复辟资本主义充当“活工具”。这是多么毒辣啊！
    毛主席指出：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”工人阶级是领导阶级，是国家的主人翁。我们努力生产，为的是建设社会主义，为的是支援世界革命，绝不是为了几个臭钱。我们工人恨透了中国赫鲁晓夫那一套。过去许多同志不愿意评奖，有的干脆不参加评奖会。一九五八年，在大跃进的鼓舞下，我们车间打破了不合理的制度，搞了联合开车的试验，大家很积极。但是，印把子掌握在厂内走资派手里，他们死抱住修正主义路线不放，以责任分不清、奖金没法评为借口，硬把这个刚出现的新生事物压下去了。无产阶级文化大革命中，我们造了党内走资派的反，夺回了工厂的大权，工人真正当家做主了，按照毛泽东思想办工厂、管工厂才有了可靠的保证。
    我们车间，经常存在人少任务重、车多没人开的“老大难”问题。去年有个时期，由于阶级敌人的捣乱和受无政府主义思潮的影响，这个矛盾更加突出。怎么办？这是大家头脑里天天想的问题。我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，冲垮了修正主义的管理制度。丙班台车组的同志，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，首先提出了以小组为单位联合开车的倡议。这个倡议，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的大力支持下，从去年十月开始，逐步在全车间推广了。
    实现了联合开车后，人员统一调配、互相协作、互相帮助，打破了过去各顾各的局面，把所有停着的车子都开动起来了。联合开车后，我们班前、班后向毛主席请示汇报，自动组织“天天读”，活学活用毛主席著作，促进了思想革命化，做到了以无产阶级政治统帅业务。过去走资派用管、压、卡对付工人，我们就是不买他的账；现在我们以解放军为榜样，大兴“三八”作风，自觉地增强了革命的组织性纪律性，树立了为革命开车、对人民负责的思想。过去怕出次品没奖金，有的开车工人与检验工人闹矛盾；现在织布出了长疵点，自己主动记卡片。人与人的关系大变样，形成了一个战斗的集体。联合开车也促进了管理工作的革命化。过去车间管理人员在人员调配、任务安排等事务中兜圈子，现在从烦琐的事务中解放出来，可以更好地做政治思想工作，有更多的时间参加生产劳动。联合开车推动了生产的发展，节省了劳动力，减少了停车时间，提高了机器运转率，增加了产量，保证了质量。
    今年七月底，我厂响应毛主席的号召，派了许多工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队到大学去。当时阶级敌人造谣说：“针织总厂停产了！”妄图破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，真把我们肺都气炸了。事实上，我们发挥了冲天的革命干劲，一个人顶几个人干，没有停一台车，充分体现了联合开车的优越性。全厂不但没停产，而且超额完成了任务，给阶级敌人一记响亮的耳光。
    实现和巩固联合开车的过程，是与阶级敌人斗争的过程。在斗、批、改中，通过清理阶级队伍，挖出了破坏联合开车的阶级敌人，提高了大家的阶级觉悟。同时，也是与我们头脑中“私”字斗争的过程。有的同志对联合开车不习惯，怕乱、怕累，想恢复以前的老样子。针对存在的活思想，我们进行“斗私，批修”，活学活用“老三篇”。大家认识到，联合开车，发挥了集体主义精神，是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的一朵红花。我们要听毛主席的话，永远为无产阶级革命开车。
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利，忠于毛主席就是最大的幸福。我们工人阶级对毛主席最忠，毛主席的一系列最新指示，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。毛主席为工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气。全厂正在掀起一个学习最新指示、全面落实最新指示的高潮，我们决心挑好革命和生产两副重担，进一步搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
