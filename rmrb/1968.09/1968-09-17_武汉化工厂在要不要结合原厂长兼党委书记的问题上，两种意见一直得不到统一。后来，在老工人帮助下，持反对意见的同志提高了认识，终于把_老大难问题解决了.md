The Wuhan Chemical Factory has been unable to reach a consensus on whether to retain the former factory director and party secretary. Later, with the help of veteran workers, those who opposed the idea improved their understanding, and finally resolved this long-standing difficult issue.

The Wuhan Chemical Factory achieved revolutionary unity nearly three months ago, but the revolutionary committee has yet to be established. A "three minus one" difficult problem has hindered progress: whether to retain the former factory director and party secretary, Li Mingyue, has become the central topic of discussion among all the workers. One faction, primarily composed of workers, and another faction, primarily composed of office staff, have differing opinions. One side wants to retain him, while the other side expresses unwillingness to forgive. The factory's revolutionary mass organization, the Service Team, has tried many methods, but with little effect.

Time marches on, and the situation is developing. The factory urgently needs strong leadership for its struggle, criticism, and reform, but reaching a consensus on retaining Li Mingyue is proving difficult. What should be done? Some workers in the Service Team suggested sending office staff to the workshops to discuss with the workers. Others were concerned that office staff, being eloquent, might persuade the workers instead, making the situation more complicated. The military support personnel, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching: "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience," firmly believed that veteran workers with the most practical experience could solve problems that intellectuals could not. Therefore, they resolutely supported sending office staff to the workshops to discuss and resolve the issue of cadres together with the workers.

The discussion in Workshop Three was heated. Veteran workers Pan Fengying and Yang Quanlin said: "Old Li used to often be with us workers, climbing into chimneys and sweeping coal ash, day and night, always in the workshop. We workers see clearly, and we trust such cadres." An office staff member said: "He can't do it. In the early stages of the movement, he implemented a reactionary line and liked to retaliate. Once we needed to settle accounts, he didn't approve it. If we retain him, he might make things difficult for us later, and we can't stand it." The veteran workers immediately refuted this view, saying: "We are clear about the situation. That wasn't retaliation; it was strict management and being responsible for revolutionary work. We look at cadres by their integrity, their entire history, and their entire work, not just one moment or one event. Although he implemented a reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, he corrected himself, and we shouldn't hold a grudge." With the help of the veteran workers, the office staff improved their understanding and unified their thoughts. Li Mingyue was later elected as the head of the Revolutionary Committee.

    武汉化工厂在要不要结合原厂长兼党委书记的问题上，两种意见一直得不到统一。后来，在老工人帮助下，持反对意见的同志提高了认识，终于把——
    老大难问题解决了
    武汉化工厂实现革命大联合快三个月了，革命委员会还迟迟没有诞生。一个“三缺一”的老大难问题拖住了前进的步伐：是否结合原厂长兼党委书记李明月，成了全厂职工讨论的中心。以工人为主体的一派和以科室干部为主体的一派，发生了分歧，一方面要结合，一方面表示不能谅解。这个厂的革命群众组织勤务组曾经想过许多办法，效果不大。
    时间在前进，形势在发展，厂里的斗、批、改迫切需要有力的领导，可是对结合李明月的问题，一时很难把意见统一起来。怎么办？勤务组有的工人同志建议把科室人员分到车间去，让他们和工人一起讨论。有人又认为科室人员能说会道，担心工人说服不了科室干部，科室干部倒说服了工人，反而把事情搞得更复杂。解放军支左人员牢记毛主席的教导：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”他们坚信最有实践经验的老工人能够解决知识分子解决不了的问题。因此，坚决支持科室人员到车间和工人一起讨论解决干部问题。
    三车间的讨论在热烈地进行。老工人潘凤英、杨泉林等说：“老李过去就经常和我们工人在一起钻烟囱、扫煤渣，不管白天夜晚，总是呆在车间里，我们工人看得清楚，这样的干部我们信得过。”一位科室人员却说：“他不行。在运动初期执行过反动路线，而且喜欢打击报复。有一次我们要报销，他就不批。要是结合了他，以后给我们穿小鞋，那我们吃不消。”老工人们马上批驳了这个看法，说：“这情况我们清楚，那不是打击报复，是管得严，对革命工作认真负责。我们看干部要看大节，看他的全部历史和全部工作，不能看一时一事。文化大革命中虽然执行了反动路线，但是改了就好了，我们不能抓住不放。”在老工人的帮助下，科室人员提高了认识，统一了思想。李明月后来被推选为革委会里的第一把手。
