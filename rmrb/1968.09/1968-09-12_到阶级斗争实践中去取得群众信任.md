Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The core is recognized by the masses in struggle and practice, not self-appointed." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary committee of Xiaoshan County in Zhejiang Province held a meeting to assign duties to its members. The military representative proposed to take on the responsibility of handling daily household chores, allowing the former first secretary of the county committee and the main leader of the revolutionary committee, Zhang Kemin, to go to the Linpu District, where class struggle is most complicated, to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. This proposal was agreed upon by everyone. Zhang Kemin also actively requested to go to undergo tempering and testing.

The Linpu District had previously been severely affected by the capitalist reactionary line. After Zhang Kemin went there, he often combined his own mistakes with the essence of the two-line struggle in Xiaoshan County, and spoke about the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left. However, at this time, some people said to him:

"We have protected you correctly, even the 'class leader' has been liberated, so we should also be 'liberated'!"

Zhang Kemin heard these words and immediately realized that this was a rightist backlash trend. He immediately pointed out: "Before my problems are exposed and criticized, and I return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, protecting me is wrong, it is pushing me towards the capitalist reactionary line. Only by exposing and criticizing me can you truly help me and care for me." Zhang Kemin also specifically went to the leader of a faction to do work, persuading him to dissolve the faction he had formed. The broad revolutionary masses were satisfied, saying, "Old Zhang's stance has truly returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Once, a few people from a commune reported to Old Zhang that the revolutionary mass organization in their commune did not implement policies well, did not take care of the families of those who were deceived, and even deducted their work points. Zhang Kemin thought that if policies were not implemented, it would not only damage the prestige of the revolutionary mass organization but, more importantly, it would not unite the broad masses of people and severely strike at a handful of class enemies. Therefore, he raised this issue to the leaders of the revolutionary mass organization. Some comrades did not understand and said he was "supporting the old conservatives" and proposed to attack him. The military representative, upon hearing this, firmly supported Old Zhang's views and enthusiastically encouraged him to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Later, Zhang Kemin, through painstaking ideological and political work, finally persuaded everyone to act according to the Party's policies, which strengthened and developed the revolutionary great alliance in this commune and promoted the rapid establishment of the revolutionary committee.

After several months of struggle and practice, Zhang Kemin established a deep proletarian relationship with the broad revolutionary masses and gained their trust.

    到阶级斗争实践中去取得群众信任
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“核心是在斗争中实践中群众公认的，不是自封的。”浙江省萧山县革委会根据毛主席的这一教导，在一次革委会委员分工会议上，军队代表提出承担家里日常工作，让原县委第一书记、革委会主任张克明同志，深入到阶级斗争最复杂的临浦区去举办毛泽东思想学习班。这个建议得到了大家的同意。张克明也积极要求去接受锻炼和考验。
    临浦区，过去推行资产阶级反动路线比较严重。张克明同志下去后，经常结合自己犯错误的教训，给大家讲萧山县两条路线斗争的实质，讲在两条路线斗争中解放军支左部队的丰功伟绩。可是，在这个时候有些人却对他说：
  “我们保你保对了，‘班长’都解放了，我们这些人也该‘解放’啦！”张克明同志听了这些话，立即意识到这是一股右倾翻案的思潮。他当即明确指出：“在我的问题没有得到揭发、批判，还没有回到毛主席革命路线上来之前，保我就是错误的，就是把我往资产阶级反动路线上推。只有揭发、批判我，才是真正的帮助我，爱护我。”张克明同志还专门到一个拉山头的头头那里去做工作，说服他把拉起的一支队伍解散了。广大革命群众满意地说：“老张的脚跟，真的站到毛主席革命路线上来了。”
    一次，一个公社的几个群众，向老张反映说他们公社的革命群众组织掌握政策不够好，对受蒙蔽群众的家庭困难不给照顾，还扣了他们的工分。张克明同志想，政策不落实，不仅会损害革命群众组织的威信，更主要的是不能团结广大群众，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，于是便向革命群众组织负责人提出了这个问题。个别同志不理解，说他“支持老保”，并提出要炮轰他。军队代表知道后，坚决支持老张的看法，并且热情地鼓励他按毛主席指示办事。后来，张克明同志通过做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，终于说服大家按照党的政策办事，有力地巩固和发展了这个公社的革命大联合，促进了革委会的迅速建立。
    经过几个月的斗争实践，张克明同志与广大革命群众建立了深厚的无产阶级感情，取得了群众的信任。
