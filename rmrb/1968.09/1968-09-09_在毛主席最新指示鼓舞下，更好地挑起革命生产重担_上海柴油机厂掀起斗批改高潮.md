Under the inspiration of the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, the workers of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, after dispatching a large number of excellent workers to join the Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have better shouldered the burden of carrying out the revolution and promoting production. Currently, the entire factory is vigorously carrying out revolutionary criticism, purging class ranks, streamlining administration, and transferring office staff to workshops, among other tasks, and production has been steadily increasing. In August, the production tasks for diesel engines and diesel engine components were completed three days ahead of schedule, and the total work volume completed by the factory was the largest in its history.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." The workers of this factory have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and have come to understand the following:

First, the working class must not only shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production in the factory but also lead the struggle-criticism-transformation in schools and all superstructures. The working class must lead everything; this is the great historical mission entrusted by Chairman Mao and a heavy responsibility that the working class must forever bear. Therefore, we must be fully prepared in terms of ideology and be ready to send out and dispatch more production workers to other posts.

Second, the factory is an important stronghold for consolidating the socialist system and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation in the factory to the end, build up this stronghold, and turn the factory into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Third, dispatching a large number of production workers to participate in the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the superstructure is an excellent training opportunity for the broad masses of workers. Through such training, they will certainly make greater contributions to the factory's future revolutionary and production work.

Fourth, after dispatching a large number of workers, the factory must further deepen the struggle between the two lines in the production domain, vigorously promote technological revolution, and continuously improve technical levels and labor productivity.

After studying and raising their awareness, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory quickly launched a high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation. Based on the revolutionary criticism, the entire factory further carried out the work of streamlining administration and transferring office staff to workshops, reducing the original eight offices to three groups and one office, and further reducing the office staff by two-thirds, transferring them to various workshops.

At the same time, the entire factory extensively carried out the "three-in-one combination" activity of workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres, successfully researching many technological innovation projects, and more effectively improving labor productivity.

    在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下，更好地挑起革命生产重担
    上海柴油机厂掀起斗批改高潮
    革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，精兵简政、下放科室人员等各项工作搞得轰轰烈烈，生产一直稳步上升
    据新华社上海四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示鼓舞下，上海柴油机厂抽调大批优秀工人参加上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队以后，留厂革命职工更好地挑起了抓革命、促生产的重担。现在，全厂革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、精兵简政、下放科室人员等各项工作搞得轰轰烈烈，生产一直稳步上升。八月份，柴油机和柴油机配件的生产任务已提前三天完成，全厂完成的总工作量，比历史上任何一个月都大。
    毛主席最近教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这个厂的工人群众反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，他们在学习中认识到：
    一，工人阶级不仅要挑起工厂的革命和生产两副重担，而且要领导学校和一切上层建筑的斗、批、改。工人阶级必须领导一切，这是毛主席交给的伟大的历史使命，是工人阶级要永远担当的重任。因此，一定要作好充分的思想准备，准备输送和抽调出更多的生产工人，到其他工作岗位上去。
    二，工厂是巩固社会主义制度和加强无产阶级专政的重要阵地。一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，把工厂的斗、批、改进行到底，把工厂这个阵地建设好，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    三，抽调出大批生产工人参加上层建筑领域内的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，这对广大工人群众是极好的锻炼，经过这样的锻炼，他们必然会对工厂今后的革命和生产等各项工作作出更大的贡献。
    四，抽调大批工人以后，工厂一定要更加深入地开展生产领域内的两条路线斗争，大闹技术革命，不断提高技术水平和劳动生产率。
    通过学习提高了认识以后，全厂革命职工很快掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。在革命大批判的基础上，全厂进一步开展了精兵简政和下放科室人员的工作，把原来的八个科室精简为三组一室，并且又精简了三分之二的科室人员，下放到了各个车间。
    与此同时，全厂还广泛地开展了工人、革命技术人员和革命干部三结合的活动，研究成功了许多技术革新项目，更有效地提高了劳动生产率。
