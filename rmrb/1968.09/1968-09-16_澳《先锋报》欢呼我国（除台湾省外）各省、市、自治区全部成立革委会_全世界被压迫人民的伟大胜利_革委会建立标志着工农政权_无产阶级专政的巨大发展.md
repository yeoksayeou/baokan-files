	Newspaper "Pioneer" of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) published an article on September 12, celebrating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province). The article enthusiastically praised, "This is a great victory for all oppressed peoples of the world."

	The article titled "The Great Victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat" stated that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) "has pushed the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat to a higher stage."

	The article sternly refuted the slanderous lies of "the two allied countries, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism." It said, "Throughout this revolutionary process, imperialism and revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique have exposed their wolfish ambitions." "They have repeatedly asserted that the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat has failed." "They fabricated various rumors, claiming that domestic order in China is in chaos."

	The article further pointed out that the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in China has achieved great victories. "The 'chaos' has disrupted the capitalist roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev. These scoundrels have been exposed and overthrown." "On the other hand, Chinese workers, peasants, and students have been greatly tempered in the struggle. They have greatly strengthened the proletarian dictatorship in China."

	The article emphasized, "The establishment of revolutionary committees composed of representatives of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) marks a great development of the worker-peasant power—the proletarian dictatorship."

	The article said, the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in China, "forms a sharp contrast with the treacherous betrayal of the proletarian dictatorship by the Soviet revisionist clique and the Czechoslovak revisionist clique. They have shamefully degenerated, while the Chinese people are more than ever holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." This great victory also "forms a sharp contrast with the crisis faced by U.S. imperialism and all its allies, who are indeed in chaos under the hands of the people of the world."

	The article concluded, "All revolutionaries in Australia, together with the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole of China, celebrate this new milestone of the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat."

    澳《先锋报》欢呼我国（除台湾省外）各省、市、自治区全部成立革委会
    全世界被压迫人民的伟大胜利
    革委会建立标志着工农政权——无产阶级专政的巨大发展
    新华社墨尔本十四日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》十二日发表文章，欢呼中国全国（除台湾省以外）各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会。文章热情赞扬说：“这是全世界被压迫人民的伟大胜利。”
    这篇题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利》的文章说，全中国（除台湾省以外）各省、市、自治区革命委员会全部成立，“把中国的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个更高的阶段”。
    文章严正驳斥了“美帝和苏修这两个盟国”诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的无耻谰言。文章说：“在这场革命的整个进程中，帝国主义和以苏修集团为首的修正主义清楚地暴露了它们的狼子野心。”“它们无数次地断言无产阶级文化大革命失败了。”“它们编造了种种谣言，说什么中国国内秩序混乱。”
    文章接着指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大胜利，“‘混乱’是乱了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的走资本主义道路的当权派。这些坏蛋被揪出来打倒了。”“另一方面，中国的工人、农民、学生在斗争中受到了很大锻炼。他们大大加强了中国的无产阶级专政。”
    文章强调说：“全中国（除台湾省以外）建立了由人民解放军的代表、革命群众的代表和革命干部的代表所组成的革命委员会，这标志着工农政权——无产阶级专政的巨大发展。”
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，“同苏修集团和捷修集团卑鄙地背叛无产阶级专政形成了鲜明的对照。它们已可耻地堕落下去。而中国人民却空前地高举着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。”这一伟大胜利也“同美帝国主义及其一切盟国所遭受的危机形成了鲜明的对照，它们在世界人民手下确实陷入了混乱”。
    文章最后说：“澳大利亚全体革命者同中国共产党人和全中国人民一道，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的这一新的标志。”
