The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." This brilliant thought of our great leader Chairman Mao fully embodies the great aspirations of the 700 million Chinese people and illuminates our path forward.

In the triumphant song of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese working class, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, has thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line advocated by China's Khrushchev, and has established the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, creating one miracle after another that bourgeois philistines could never have imagined. We have completely shattered the counter-revolutionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev, such as the philosophy of servility to foreigners, the policy of crawling, and the expert line. We dare to aim high, stand on the principle of "surpassing," and focus on "innovation." We break free from foreign frameworks and smash foreign dogmas, using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the scientific and technological front, and push metallurgical science and technology to the world's advanced level. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

In the development of science and technology, there is a fierce struggle between the lines of "imitation" and "innovation."

To implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must firmly adhere to the principle of developing science and technology based on our own strengths and walk our own path of industrial development.

China's Khrushchev fiercely opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and, in the development of science and technology, vigorously advocates imitating foreigners and relying on foreigners to promote internal development. He attempts to make us crawl back to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society according to his counter-revolutionary philosophy of servility to foreigners, and become slaves of imperialism again. But this will never happen.

We must have what foreigners have, and we must also have what foreigners do not have. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres of our company have liberated their minds, broken away from superstitions, and are determined to push metallurgical technology to the world's advanced level, and trample imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries under our feet. However, as soon as we launched a technological revolution to scale the heights of world science, the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" who have always been praised by China's Khrushchev jumped out, parroting China's Khrushchev's servile tone of "scientific research should be promoted from the outside," saying, "You lack data and experience, and have no theoretical basis. How can you, with just this little bit, scale the world scientific heights that even foreign experts can only look up to?!" They flip through foreign books, check data, use calculators, compare horizontally and vertically, and try to obstruct our march into the new realm of metallurgical technology, wanting us to obediently follow the arrangements of "foreigners."

"Some weep, lamenting the steps they cannot take!" When we, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the obstacles of bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and overcame one difficulty after another, making this metallurgical technology reach a new height, some units that followed China's Khrushchev's philosophy of servility to foreigners and crawled along, again took the stage, saying, "The idea is good, but the basis is not enough, and it does not provide enough grounds for design, and it is not feasible." Their evil intentions are simply to make us turn back to the path of "imitation" advocated by China's Khrushchev, following the path of imitation of imperialism and revisionism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the revolutionary workers of our company, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seized back the leadership of science and technology that had been usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary "authorities," carried out thorough criticism and repudiation, thoroughly smashed China's Khrushchev's philosophy of servility to foreigners, and finally planted the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the peak of world metallurgical technology.

This fierce struggle between the lines of "innovation" and "imitation" once again powerfully proves that only by thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line and establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we, in the field of science and technology, "make discoveries, inventions, innovations, and progress," and take big strides to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level.

    砸烂洋奴哲学　攀登科学高峰
    甘肃冶金公司工人　永向阳
    “中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一光辉思想集中体现了七亿中国人民的雄心壮志，照亮了我们前进的方向。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，大破中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义科技路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，创造了一个又一个资产阶级庸人所意想不到的人间奇迹，用事实彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的洋奴哲学、爬行主义和专家路线等反革命谬论。我们“敢”字当头，立足于“超”，着眼于“创”，打破洋框框，砸烂洋教条，用毛泽东思想占领科技阵地，把冶金科学技术推进到世界先进水平。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
    在发展科学技术的道路上，是“仿”，还是“创”，存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。
    贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就要坚定不移地把发展科学技术的方针，“放在自己力量的基点上”。走中国自己工业发展的道路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在发展科学技术上竭力鼓吹崇洋仿外，以外促内，妄图使我们按照他的这一套反革命洋奴哲学爬行，爬回到半殖民地半封建社会去，重新变成帝国主义的奴隶。但这是永远也办不到的。
    外国有的我们要有，外国没有的我们也要有。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们公司的广大革命工人和无产阶级革命派，解放思想，破除迷信，决心把冶金技术推进到世界先进水平的高峰，把帝、修、反踩在自己的脚下。但是，当我们的一项攀登世界科学高峰的技术革命战斗一打响，中国赫鲁晓夫一贯吹捧的资产阶级反动“权威”就跳了出来，学着中国赫鲁晓夫“科学研究要以外促内”的洋奴腔调，说什么“你们既缺乏资料经验，又无理论根据，就凭这个摊摊能攀登连外国专家也望尘莫及的世界科学高峰？！”他们翻洋书，查数据，拉计算尺，横比竖算，妄图阻挠我们向冶金技术新领域进军，要我们俯首帖耳地听从“洋人”的摆布。
    “有人泣，为营步步嗟何及！”当我们用伟大的毛泽东思想，冲破了资产阶级反动“权威”的阻拦，战胜了一个又一个的困难，使这项冶金技术登上新的高峰的时候，一些外单位的按照中国赫鲁晓夫洋奴哲学爬行的“高贵者”，又粉墨登场，胡说什么：“想法很好，依据不多，为设计提供根据不够，不可取。”其罪恶用心，无非是要我们回头走中国赫鲁晓夫“仿”字当头，效法帝、修的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我们公司的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动“权威”篡夺的科学技术领导权，深入地开展革命大批判，彻底砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫的洋奴哲学，终于把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插上了世界冶金技术的高峰。
    这场“创”和“仿”的两条路线的激烈斗争，又一次有力地证明了只有彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义科技路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们在科学技术上，才能“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”，才能大踏步地赶超世界先进水平。
