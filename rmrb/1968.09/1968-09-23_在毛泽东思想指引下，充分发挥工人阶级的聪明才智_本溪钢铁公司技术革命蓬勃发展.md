The revolutionary workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. In the great struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, they have achieved one great victory after another. As the struggle, criticism, and transformation deepens throughout the company, a new high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution has emerged. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

Currently, from the factory to the workshop, from the work section to the team, technological innovation and technological revolution projects are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. According to statistics, from January to August this year, 280 technological innovation and technological revolution projects have been implemented. Especially in the few short months since the birth of the revolutionary committee, 66 relatively major technological innovation and technological revolution projects have been implemented. Among these, nine have reached or surpassed the world's advanced level. After successfully developing the first domestically produced electric furnace hydraulic automatic control device with international advanced standards in December last year, the revolutionary workers of the Mechanical and Electrical Factory have continued to advance, developing the "Dongfanghong" electric furnace "Risk Peak" device—electric furnace steelmaking automatic control device, which surpasses international advanced standards. This has created more favorable conditions for the rapid, efficient, and economical development of the electric furnace steelmaking industry in China, meeting the country's demand for high-grade alloy steel. This leap in China's electric furnace automatic control technology has greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese working class, struck a blow to the arrogance of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of Benxi Iron and Steel. They have taken the Mechanical and Electrical Factory as an example, setting ambitious goals and determined to tread paths that no one has walked before, scaling technological peaks that no one has reached. Following the Mechanical and Electrical Factory, the new technology of successfully applying a frequency-sensitive resistor to a large main electric motor has been achieved at Benxi Iron and Steel Factory. Currently, various countries around the world use a metal resistor to control large electric motor drive equipment. This drive equipment has a complex structure, is inconvenient to maintain, has low sensitivity, and is not conducive to the safe operation of electric motors. This problem has been a major technical issue that various countries have been exploring and researching for many years. Now, the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has solved it. As soon as this major technological innovation appeared, new good news came: a large electric hydraulic track-type tamping machine, which plays a significant role in promoting the mechanization of China's railway maintenance work, has also been successfully developed in the transportation department of Benxi Iron and Steel. Railway maintenance workers joyfully said, "Now we can put down our shovels and hoes, greatly improve our work efficiency, and be freed from heavy manual labor!"

    在毛泽东思想指引下，充分发挥工人阶级的聪明才智
    本溪钢铁公司技术革命蓬勃发展
    据新华社沈阳二十一日电　本溪钢铁公司广大革命职工，在中国人民解放军支左部队的大力支持和帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中获得了一个又一个的巨大胜利。全公司随着斗、批、改的深入发展，出现了一个蓬蓬勃勃的技术革新、技术革命的新高潮。革命、生产形势一片大好。
    目前，这个公司从厂矿到车间，从工段到班组，技术革新、技术革命项目，如同雨后春笋般接连出现。据统计，仅今年一至八月份实现的技术革新、技术革命项目就达二百八十多项，特别是革命委员会诞生后的短短几个月，就实现了比较重大的技术革新、技术革命项目六十六项。其中，有九项达到和超过了世界先进水平。机电厂的革命职工在去年十二月试制成功我国第一台具有国际先进水平的电炉液压自动控制装置之后，今年昂首阔步，乘胜前进，又搞成了超过国际先进水平的“东方红号”电炉“险峰”装置——电炉炼钢自动控制装置，为我国多快好省地发展电炉炼钢工业，满足国家对高级合金钢的需要，创造了更加有利的条件。我国电炉自动控制技术的这一飞跃，大长了中国工人阶级的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风，极大地鼓舞了本钢广大革命职工。他们以机电厂为榜样，树雄心，立壮志，决心走前人没有走过的路，攀登前人没有攀登过的技术高峰。继机电厂之后，在大型主电机上第一次成功地应用频敏变阻器的新技术，又在本钢钢厂搞成了。目前，世界各国在大型电动机传动设备上，大都是采用一种金属电阻来控制。这种传动装置设备构造复杂，维护不方便，灵敏度低，对电动机的安全运转也不利。这个问题，多少年来一直是各国探讨研究的重大技术课题。现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级把它解决了。这项重大技术革新刚刚出现，又传来新的捷报：对促进我国铁路养路工作机械化有重大作用的大型电动液压轨道式捣固机，又在本钢运输部试制成功。铁路养路工人高兴地说，这下我们养路工可以放下锹镐，大大提高工效，从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来了！
