Zhangying is a residential area for the employees of Baotou Steel Company and the Second Metallurgical Construction Company, housing over 3,000 families with a population of more than 13,000. It is a beautiful place, with the majestic Wula Mountains behind it and the grand and magnificent grassland steel city in front.

However, in the past, the agents of China's Khrushchev here, driven by the ambition to restore capitalism, spread revisionist poison, advocating "eat well, dress well, play well," causing many people to detach themselves from proletarian politics and focus on household affairs.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a spring thunder, struck down the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and other class enemies in the area, scattering them like fallen flowers. The sun of Mao Zedong Thought shone upon Zhangying. Revolutionary employees and their families, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carried out class education, and conducted in-depth revolutionary criticism. The face of Zhangying underwent a drastic change.

The New Realm of Mao Zedong Thought

Today's Zhangying is full of a thriving revolutionary atmosphere. Revolutionary employees and their families, with profound proletarian feelings, hang a portrait of Chairman Mao in the brightest spot in their homes, and cover the walls with Chairman Mao's quotations and various paper cuttings of "Loyalty to Chairman Mao." Every morning, they face the rising sun to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Chairman Mao's teachings to guide their thoughts and actions throughout the day. In the evening, they use Chairman Mao's teachings to review their work, study, and life, praising the good and correcting the wrong.

The changes in Zhangying are the result of organizing extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Organizing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," reached Zhangying. People responded enthusiastically. Study classes in every building, family study classes, Red Guards study classes, and "three-in-one" study classes for workers, families, and students bloomed like a thousand flowers in every corner of Zhangying. In the evenings, during the activity time of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, you could see men, women, old, and young gathered together. Some were discussing the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praising Chairman Mao's great wisdom; some were loudly reading Chairman Mao's latest instructions; some were pouring out the bitterness of the old society; some were sharing their experiences of breaking private interests and establishing public interests. What a lively political scene!

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes have added the most important and richest content to the political life of Zhangying, causing a profound change in the spiritual face of the people of Zhangying. A story of "four-year enemies becoming in-laws" is circulating here. Employee family members Ming Shuqin and Liu Yuhuang are neighbors. Four years ago, a quarrel over children led to a dispute, and since then, the two have been "holding a grudge, turning their heads when they meet," forming a "dead knot." However, their love for Chairman Mao's proletarian cause is equally deep, and they both want to execute Chairman Mao's instructions without falling behind. In the building's Mao Zedong Thought study class, Chairman Mao's latest instructions made their hearts think in the same direction: We are two bitter gourds on the same vine! Chairman Mao teaches, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." We are both daughters of poor peasants, how can we be irreconcilable? Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, the heavens and earth are not as great as Chairman Mao's grace. We will do as Chairman Mao says, otherwise, how can we repay Chairman Mao! The next morning, Ming Shuqin, holding the revolutionary treasure book, came to Liu Yuhuang's house. The red sun illuminated their hearts, and the hands of class sisters were tightly held together again. They stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: For a lifetime, we will read Chairman Mao's books, for a lifetime, we will listen to Chairman Mao's words, for a lifetime, we will unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin! To express their deep love for Chairman Mao, they also cut a paper cutting of "Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao" together, displayed in the exhibition hall of Zhangying.

The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of the people of Zhangying. Today, Zhangying is a new realm of Mao Zedong Thought.

Everywhere is a Battlefield of Revolutionary Criticism

Zhangying is everywhere a battlefield of revolutionary criticism.

When the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issued the battle order to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary employees and their families of Zhangying responded enthusiastically. From first-grade students to people over seventy years old, everyone rose up to join the battle, with everyone criticizing with their mouths and pens, creating various forms of criticism. There are street criticism columns, building criticism columns, family criticism columns; there are street criticism meetings, building criticism meetings, family criticism meetings. In addition, they use broadcasting, arts, and other forms to carry out revolutionary criticism. Fathers and sons go to the battlefield together, men and women go to the battlefield together, husbands and wives go to the battlefield together. The momentum of the revolutionary criticism mass movement is overwhelming.

In the 9th building, 5th unit, lives an old woman named Jiang Shukui. In the old society, she suffered endless torment, and it was Chairman Mao who saved her from the fire, allowing her family to live the happy life of today. When she heard on her sickbed that China's Khrushchev advocated "exploitation is meritorious," trying to make the working people live in the old society again, cold and hungry, worse than cattle and horses, the old woman gritted her teeth in anger. She said, "Chairman Mao is the dearest, socialism is the best. China's Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao, opposes socialism, I will risk this old life to fight to the end with him!" After speaking, she struggled to get out of bed. She had never held a pen before, but with her deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, she put all her strength into her right hand, tightly gripping the pen, drawing from evening until the next early morning at four o'clock, creating a cartoon criticizing China's Khrushchev.

In Zhangying, people regard revolutionary criticism as the top priority. Once the notice for a criticism meeting is issued, men, women, old, and young immediately set out. Seventy-three-year-old Song Grandma heard that a historical counter-revolutionary would be criticized and immediately, with the help of her son, hurried to the venue with her cane. She pointed at the nose of the counter-revolutionary and conducted a face-to-face struggle with him until he was criticized into a sorry state, admitting his guilt with his head down.

The Red Guards Propaganda Team

Every day, whether it is windy and sandy or rainy, you can see a team of spirited Red Guards, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao, singing revolutionary songs, marching in unison, setting out from Zhangying to nearby factories, mines, and villages to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and perform revolutionary art programs for workers and poor and lower-middle peasants.

We visited a Red Guards propaganda team. They proudly said, "Chairman Mao is our red commander, we are Chairman Mao's red guards. Our red hearts forever face the red sun. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought, even if we are tired, we are not afraid!" Once, they went to the Baotou Steel Initial Rolling Mill, fifteen li away, to propagate. On the way, suddenly a heavy rain poured down, soaking their clothes, making their bodies cold. At this time, the Red Guards tightly held Chairman Mao's portrait to their chests, loudly reading "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," continuing to march on the muddy road. When they arrived at a worker's shed, the worker uncles asked them to perform. Although they were cold and tired, when they thought of propagating Mao Zedong Thought as their sacred duty and greatest glory, they happily satisfied the worker uncles' request. After performing, they continued to march towards the Initial Rolling Mill in the rain.

How many Red Guards propaganda teams are there in Zhangying? The comrade in charge of the family area work told us that there are more than sixty such organized propaganda teams. As for the children who temporarily and spontaneously organize in groups of three or five, there is no count! Once Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the children's enthusiasm is high. They do not eat or sleep, but also arrange new programs, eagerly going out to propagate. Once the club has any collective activity, they all compete to perform revolutionary songs and dances on stage.

The Red Guards are growing up healthily under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 张营新貌——记包头钢铁公司、第二冶金建设公司一个家属区的变化

    张营新貌
    ——记包头钢铁公司、第二冶金建设公司一个家属区的变化
    张营是包头钢铁公司和第二冶金建设公司的一个职工家属区，住着三千多户，有一万三千多人口，这里背靠巍巍的乌拉山，面向雄伟壮观的草原钢城，是一个美好的地方。
    但是，过去，中国赫鲁晓夫在这里的代理人，出于复辟资本主义的野心，大肆散布修正主义毒素，宣扬“吃好、穿好、玩好”，使不少人脱离无产阶级政治，关心的多是家务事。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声春雷，把当地党内一小撮走资派等阶级敌人打得落花流水，毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了张营。革命的职工家属，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大抓阶级教育，深入开展革命大批判，张营的面貌发生了天翻地覆的变化。
    毛泽东思想的新天地
    今天的张营，到处是一派欣欣向荣的革命新气象。革命职工和家属，怀着无限深厚的无产阶级感情，在屋里最明亮的地方挂着毛主席像，墙壁上贴着毛主席的语录和“忠于毛主席”的各式各样的剪纸。每天早上，他们迎着初升的朝阳，学习毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席的教导统帅一天的思想和行动；晚上，又用毛主席的教导检查一天的工作、学习和生活，发扬好的，改正错的。
    张营的变化，是大办毛泽东思想学习班的成果。
    毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示传到张营，人们闻风而动，栋房学习班，家庭学习班，红小兵学习班，还有工人、家属、学生“三结合”学习班，象万花竞春般地开放在张营的每一个角落。晚上，是毛泽东思想学习班的活动时间。这时，随便走到那里，都可以看见男女老幼聚在一起，有的在畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，歌颂毛主席的英明伟大；有的在高声朗读毛主席的最新指示；有的在倾吐旧社会的苦水；有的在讲述破私立公的体会，好一派生动活泼的政治局面！
    毛泽东思想学习班，给张营的政治生活增添了最重要、最丰富的内容，使张营人民群众的精神面貌发生了极为深刻的变化。这里流传着一个四年“冤家”变“亲家”的故事。职工家属明淑芹和刘玉香是邻居，四年前因为孩子争吵引起纠纷，从此两人“心里憋股气，见面就扭头”，结成了“死疙瘩”。然而，她俩热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情却是一样深厚，执行毛主席的指示，谁也不愿落后。在栋房毛泽东思想学习班里，毛主席的最新指示，使她俩的心不约而同地往一处想：我们是一条藤上的两个苦瓜呵！毛主席教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。”我俩都是贫农的女儿，怎能势不两立？爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大。毛主席咋说咱就咋办，要不怎能对得起毛主席！第二天一早，明淑芹手捧革命宝书，来到刘玉香家。红太阳照亮了她俩的心，阶级姐妹的手又紧紧地拉在一起了。她俩站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围！为了表达对毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，她俩还在一起剪了一张“无限忠于毛主席”的剪纸，陈列在张营的展览室里。
    毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，照亮了张营人民群众的心，今天，张营的天地是毛泽东思想的新天地。
    处处是革命大批判的战场
    张营，到处是革命大批判的战场。
    当以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出要深入持久地开展革命大批判的战斗号令后，张营的革命职工和家属们闻风而动，从一年级的小学生到年过七十的老人，都奋起投入战斗，人人口诛笔伐，创造了多种多样的批判形式。这里有街道批判栏、栋房批判栏、家庭批判栏；有街头批判会、栋房批判会、家庭批判会。此外，还运用广播、文艺等形式进行革命的大批判。父子共上战场，男女同上战场，夫妇同上战场，革命大批判的群众运动气势磅礴。
    九栋五号住着一位名叫姜淑奎的老大娘，她在旧社会受尽折磨，是毛主席把她从火海里救了出来，全家才过上了今天的幸福生活。当她在病床上听说中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹
  “剥削有功”，妄想让劳动人民再过旧社会寒不得衣、饥不得食、牛马不如的生活时，老大娘气得直咬牙。她说：“毛主席最亲，社会主义最好。中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席，反对社会主义，我豁出这条老命也要和他拚到底！”说完，挣扎着下了床。她从来没拿过笔，但她怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，把全部的力量都用在右手上，握紧笔杆，从晚上一直画到次日凌晨四时，画出一幅批判中国赫鲁晓夫的漫画。
    在张营，人们把革命的大批判看作是头等大事，开批判会的通知一下达，男女老幼都立即出动。七十三岁的宋老大娘听说要批斗一个历史反革命分子，马上拄着拐杖，由儿子扶着赶到会场。她指着这个反革命分子的鼻子，同他进行了面对面的斗争，直到把他批得狼狈不堪，低头认罪。
    红小兵宣传队
    每天，不管是风沙弥漫，还是阴雨绵绵，你都可以看见一队队英姿勃勃的红小兵，高举着毛主席画像，高唱着革命歌曲，迈着整齐的步伐，从张营出发，到附近的厂矿农村，宣传毛主席的最新指示，为工人和贫下中农演出革命的文艺节目。
    我们访问了一支红小兵宣传队。他们自豪地说：“毛主席是我们的红司令，我们是毛主席的红小兵。我们颗颗红心永向红太阳。为了宣传毛泽东思想，就是再累，我们也不怕！”一次，他们到十五里地远的包钢初轧厂去宣传。路上，突然大雨瓢泼，衣服湿透了，全身冰凉。这时，红小兵们把毛主席像紧紧地贴在胸口，齐声朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，继续行进在泥泞的道路上。当他们行进到一个工棚时，工人叔叔要求他们演出，这时他们虽然是冷、累交加，但当他们想到宣传毛泽东思想是自己神圣的职责、最大的光荣时，欣然满足了工人叔叔的要求。演完，他们又冒雨继续向初轧厂进发。
    张营究竟有多少支红小兵宣传队呢？负责家属区工作的同志告诉我们，象这样有组织的宣传队就有六十多，至于孩子们三个一组，五人一群，临时自动地组织起来的可就没数了！毛主席的最新指示一传下来，孩子们的热情可高啦，饭不吃，觉不睡，也要编排新节目，争先恐后去宣传。一旦俱乐部有什么集体活动，他们都竞相上台表演革命的歌舞。
    红小兵们正在毛泽东思想的阳光抚育下茁壮成长。
