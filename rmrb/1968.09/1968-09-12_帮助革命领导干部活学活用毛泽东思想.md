The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To correctly handle cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This must be resolved." A large amount of facts fully prove that Chairman Mao's extremely important instruction has played a very great role in promoting the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels. Now, in the situation where the whole country is red and revolutionary committees have been universally established, how to correctly handle revolutionary cadres, enthusiastically help and support them, and let them fully play a leading role in the revolutionary committees and play a greater role in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, is still a very important issue. From the following articles, it can be seen that military representatives in the revolutionary committees play a very good role in this regard. The practices of these military representatives are worth learning from.

Helping Revolutionary Cadres to Study and Apply Chairman Mao Zedong's Thoughts Actively

The original deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Xinanjiang Hydropower Plant, Comrade Feng Shuren, after taking up the position of the head of the revolutionary committee, faced some difficulties in his work and his prestige among the masses was not very high after a period of work.

Why was Comrade Feng Shuren's prestige among the masses not high? In connection with his thoughts and work situation before and after entering the "three-in-one" leadership cadre, military representative Wu Yuzhu analyzed the situation with him and found the problem. It turned out that Comrade Feng was busy with mundane affairs in his actual work, forgot to grasp the fundamentals, and did not hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Naturally, his prestige among the masses was not high. In response to this situation, Comrade Wu Yuzhu studied with him the teachings of Chairman Mao on the cadre issue. Chairman Mao teaches: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The revolutionary masses measure a leading cadre mainly by how high he holds the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Wu Yuzhu also reviewed with Comrade Feng the high evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought by Comrade Lin Biao. Vice Chairman Lin said: "Chairman Mao's words have the highest level, the highest prestige, and the greatest power," which made Comrade Feng Shuren realize that the higher a revolutionary's level of Mao Zedong Thought, the higher his prestige among the masses.

After this, Comrade Wu Yuzhu often studied Chairman Mao's works with Comrade Feng. As soon as a new directive from Chairman Mao was issued, they analyzed the situation together, discussed their thoughts, and learned one step ahead. Last winter and this spring, the rainfall was less, and in May and June, the water level in the reservoir dropped to the lowest level since the plant was built, causing some difficulties for hydropower generation. At this critical moment, should we focus on production or use revolution to promote production? Comrade Feng followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," went deep into the site, held a symposium with workers and grassroots cadres directly in charge of production, listened to the workers' opinions, and studied the new directives with them, turning Chairman Mao's directives into a great driving force, promoting production. Under the leadership of the plant's revolutionary committee, through the efforts of all revolutionary masses in the plant, the difficulties caused by the drop in the reservoir water level were overcome, and the electricity generation tasks were completed and exceeded every month.

With the help of the military representative, Comrade Feng Shuren often consciously acted according to Chairman Mao's directives, and the broad revolutionary masses trusted him more and more.

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”大量的事实充分证明，毛主席这一极其重要的指示，对推动各级革命委员会的建立起了非常巨大的作用。现在，在全国一片红、各级革命委员会普遍建立的情况下，如何正确地对待革命的领导干部，热情地帮助和支持他们，让他们在革委会中充分发挥骨干作用，在斗、批、改的高潮中发挥更大的作用，仍然是一个十分重要的问题。从下面发表的这几篇文章中可以看出，革委会中的军队代表在这方面起着很好的作用。这些军队代表的作法是值得学习的。

    帮助革命领导干部活学活用毛泽东思想
    新安江水力发电厂原党委副书记冯树仁同志自从担任了革委会主任以后，经过一段时间的工作，在群众中的威信不太高，工作有些困难。
    为什么冯树仁同志在群众中的威信不够高呢？联系他进入“三结合”领导班子前后的思想和工作情况，军队代表吴玉柱就和他一起找问题，分析原因。原来老冯在实际工作中只忙于事务，忘了抓根本，毛泽东思想红旗举得不高。这样，在群众中的威信自然就不高了。针对这个情况，吴玉柱同志和他一起学习了毛主席关于干部问题的论述。毛主席教导说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”革命群众衡量领导干部的标准，主要是看你毛泽东思想红旗举得高不高。吴玉柱同志还和老冯一起，重温了林彪同志对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的崇高评价。林副主席说：“毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大”，从而使冯树仁同志认识到，一个革命者，毛泽东思想水平有多高，他在群众中的威信就有多高。
    从这以后，吴玉柱同志还经常和老冯一起学习毛主席著作。毛主席的每一条最新指示一传达，他们就在一起分析形势，摆活思想，先学一步。去冬今春，雨水较少，五、六月份水库储水量下降到建厂以来的最低水位，给水力发电带来了一定的困难。在这个关键的时候，是就生产抓生产，还是以革命来带动生产？老冯遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，深入到现场，同工人和直接指挥生产的基层干部开座谈会，听取工人的意见，并和他们一起学习最新指示，把毛主席指示变为巨大的推动力量，促进了生产。在厂革委会的领导下，经过全厂革命群众的努力，克服了水库储水量下降的困难，月月完成和超额完成了发电任务。
    在军队代表的帮助下，冯树仁同志经常自觉地按照毛主席的指示办事，广大革命群众对他也越来越信任了。
