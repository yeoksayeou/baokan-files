Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou send a telegram to Comrades Ho Chi Minh and Shehu expressing heartfelt thanks for their warm congratulations on the establishment of revolutionary committees across China.

We firmly support the revolutionary action of the People's Republic of Albania and the brotherly Albanian people in withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. We firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the control of the Soviet revisionists over the Warsaw Pact. We firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Western Europe and all countries in the world against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive treaty organizations controlled by U.S. imperialism. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of all peoples in the world who are subjected to aggression, control, enslavement, and threats by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and strengthened in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will always stand firmly with the brotherly Albanian people in any circumstances. If U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their running dogs dare to lay a finger on Albania, they will face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

New China News Agency, September 18th: The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai, sent a telegram on September 17th to the great leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, expressing heartfelt thanks and the highest respect for their warmest congratulations on the establishment of revolutionary committees in all twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, excluding Taiwan Province. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, and Comrade Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania:

At the time when revolutionary committees have been established in all twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, excluding Taiwan Province, we received your enthusiastic telegram of congratulations. This is a great encouragement and support for the Chinese people who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We express our heartfelt thanks and the highest respect to you.

Under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great Marxist-Leninist, the heroic Albanian people are carrying out a revolutionary movement of profound socialist significance, achieving one great victory after another. This year, Comrade Enver Hoxha's proposals for educational revolution and worker supervision have enriched the content of this movement and promoted its development. We warmly congratulate the brotherly Albanian people on achieving more and more brilliant victories on the revolutionary path. This victory makes the great socialist beacon of Albania in Europe shine even more brilliantly.

A few days ago, the People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its decision and decree to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. This is another heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and a great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The Warsaw Pact has long been a tool for the Khrushchev revisionist clique to promote great-power chauvinism and national egoism, to control and plunder the peoples of Eastern European countries, and to engage in deals with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by U.S. imperialism to promote U.S.-Soviet cooperation in dominating the world. Recently, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in collusion with the revisionist partners of Poland, East Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, openly used the name of the Warsaw Pact to launch a armed invasion of Czechoslovakia, committing heinous crimes against the Czechoslovakian people. This has thoroughly exposed the aggressive and reactionary nature of this pact to the people of the world. The Czechoslovakian revisionist clique has adopted a policy of surrender and betrayal to the invaders, shamefully betraying the Czechoslovakian people. Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor headed by its outstanding leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have long been waging a resolute struggle against the various evil activities of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique using the Warsaw Pact. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people highly admire the Marxist-Leninist and proletarian internationalist principles demonstrated by the Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people in this struggle.

We firmly support the revolutionary action of the People's Republic of Albania and the brotherly Albanian people in withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. We firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the control of the Soviet revisionists over the Warsaw Pact. We firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Western Europe and all countries in the world against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive treaty organizations controlled by U.S. imperialism. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of all peoples in the world who are subjected to aggression, control, enslavement, and threats by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

The great proletarian revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged in the storm of revolution, is one that can withstand severe tests. The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and strengthened in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will always stand firmly with the brotherly Albanian people in any circumstances. If U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their running dogs dare to lay a finger on Albania, they will face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

Dear comrades, the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists have done so many evil and shameful deeds, and the revolutionary people of the world will not let them off. The peoples of all countries are rising up. A new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. Let us raise the red banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher and advance together in the great struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism headed by the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries that follow the United States and the Soviet Union!

Long live the great, unbreakable revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Biao

Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai

    毛主席林副主席周总理致电霍查谢胡同志衷心感谢对我全国成立革委会的热烈祝贺
    坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民退出华沙条约的革命行动，坚决支持东欧各国人民反对苏修控制的华沙条约的正义斗争，坚决支持西欧和世界各国人民反对美帝控制的北大西洋公约以及其他侵略性条约组织的正义斗争，坚决支持全世界一切受美帝、苏修侵略、控制、奴役和威胁的各国人民的革命斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    新华社十八日讯　中国人民的伟大领袖、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友、中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志以及中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，十七日打电报给阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，对他们最热烈地祝贺我国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会，表示衷心的感谢和最大的敬意，并且坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民退出华沙条约的革命行动。电报全文如下：地拉那阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记
    恩维尔·霍查同志，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席
    穆罕默德·谢胡同志：
    在我国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的时候，我们收到了你们热情洋溢的贺电，这是对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民的巨大鼓舞和巨大支持。我们对你们表示衷心的感谢和最大的敬意。
    英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，正在开展一场具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。今年，恩维尔·霍查同志提出的教育革命和工人阶级监督，丰富了这个运动的内容，推动了这个运动的发展。我们最热烈地祝贺兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在革命化的道路上，取得越来越辉煌的胜利。这一胜利使阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义的明灯，发射出更加灿烂的光芒。
    前几天，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严地宣布退出华沙条约的决定和法令。这是对苏修叛徒集团的又一沉重打击，是对东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团斗争的巨大鼓舞。华沙条约早已成为赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团推行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义、控制和掠夺东欧各国人民的工具，早已成为苏修叛徒集团用来同美帝国主义控制的北大西洋公约组织作交易、推行美苏合作主宰世界的工具。最近，苏修叛徒集团纠集波兰、东德、匈牙利和保加利亚修正主义伙伴，公然利用华沙条约的名义，武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克，对捷克斯洛伐克人民犯下了滔天的罪行。这就在全世界人民面前彻底暴露了这个条约的侵略性和反动性。捷克斯洛伐克修正主义集团，对侵略者采取了卖国投降的政策，可耻地背叛了捷克斯洛伐克人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民在其杰出的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，对苏修叛徒集团利用华沙条约从事的种种罪恶活动，久已进行了坚决的斗争。中国共产党和中国人民十分钦佩阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民在这一斗争中所表现的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的高度原则性。
    我们坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民退出华沙条约的革命行动，坚决支持东欧各国人民反对苏修控制的华沙条约的正义斗争，坚决支持西欧和世界各国人民反对美帝控制的北大西洋公约以及其他侵略性条约组织的正义斗争，坚决支持全世界一切受美帝、苏修侵略、控制、奴役和威胁的各国人民的革命斗争。
    中阿两国人民在革命的暴风雨中建立起来的伟大的无产阶级的战斗友谊，是经受得住严峻考验的。在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    亲爱的同志们，苏修、美帝狼狈为奸，做了这么多的坏事、丑事，全世界革命人民是不会饶过他们的。世界各国人民正在起来。一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始。让我们更高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，在反对以美帝为首的帝国主义、以苏修为首的现代修正主义和紧随美帝、苏修的各国反动派的伟大斗争中，携手前进吧！
    伟大的、牢不可破的中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    中国共产党中央委员会主席　毛泽东
    中国共产党中央委员会副主席　林　彪
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
