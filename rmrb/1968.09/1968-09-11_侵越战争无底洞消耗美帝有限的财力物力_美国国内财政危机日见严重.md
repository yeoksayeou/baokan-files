The ever-increasing burden of the Vietnam War has severely depleted the U.S. imperialists' limited financial and material resources, leading to a deepening financial crisis in the United States. Inflation has reached unprecedented levels, leaving the U.S. ruling class in a state of confusion and desperation.

	War Expenditures Soar, Deficit Grows

Since the summer of 1965, when the U.S. imperialists escalated the Vietnam War, the number of invading troops in South Vietnam has increased from 45,000 to nearly 550,000. During the same period, the direct budget for the Vietnam War has surged from over $1 billion to more than $30 billion (according to U.S. publications, the actual expenditure on the Vietnam War had already reached $40 billion per year by last year). Such massive war expenditures have plunged the U.S. into a deepening financial crisis, with the federal budget deficit rising steadily. In the fiscal year 1967-1968, which has just ended, the U.S. federal government's budget deficit reached $25.4 billion, the highest on record since the war.

	Excessive Currency Issuance, Prices Skyrocket

To cover the deficits, the U.S. ruling class has been frantically issuing public debt and printing money, leading to unprecedented inflation. According to official figures, in the year ending April of this year, the U.S. federal government issued $20 billion in new public debt; in May alone, an additional $5.4 billion in new public debt was issued, bringing the total national debt to a new high of $352.9 billion. The rate of inflation is also alarming. In 1967, the money supply in the U.S. (currency in circulation plus total bank deposits) increased by 6.5% compared to the previous year, reaching $181.3 billion. In the first half of this year, the money supply increased by an additional $5.9 billion, more than 1.6 times the total increase for 1966 ($3.6 billion). This rate of increase is unprecedented since the war.

The direct consequence of accelerated inflation is a rapid rise in prices. A U.S. bank report published in May acknowledged with concern that since the end of last year, the increase in living costs in the U.S. has effectively reached an annual rate of about 4.4%. This rate is nearly four times the average annual increase (1.2%) from 1960 to early 1965, before the escalation of the Vietnam War. The rate of price increases in June and July further accelerated, breaking the record for the highest increase in eleven years. Prices for food, clothing, and medical expenses, which are most closely related to the lives of the working people, have seen particularly sharp increases. According to a recent report by "U.S. News & World Report," over the past two years, the prices of food and clothing in the U.S. have increased by more than 10% in some cases; bus fares have increased by 9%; and hospital fees have even increased by 36%.

	Sales Slump, Crisis Deepens

The rapid rise in prices has further weakened the already limited purchasing power of the broad masses of workers, exacerbating the sales difficulties in many industrial sectors and making the conditions for an overproduction crisis more ripe. At the same time, it has directly weakened the competitiveness of U.S. goods in domestic and foreign markets, resulting in a situation where the growth rate of U.S. exports this year has lagged far behind the growth rate of imports. In March, May, and June, U.S. foreign trade even experienced consecutive trade deficits, causing serious concern among U.S. monopolies. The U.S. ruling class has long relied on trade surpluses from dumping goods overseas to cover part of the international balance of payments deficit, thereby supporting the shaky position of the dollar. Now, after being hit by the largest financial crisis in the capitalist world in 40 years this year, the position of the dollar is even more precarious. The state of foreign trade has become even more crucial to the fate of the dollar. However, despite the Johnson administration's efforts to encourage exports since the beginning of the year, the U.S. trade surplus for the first seven months of the year has still sharply decreased to just $46.3 million, while the trade surplus for the same period last year was $2.6 billion.

	Helpless, Days Are Hard

Faced with numerous financial and economic difficulties, the U.S. ruling class is at a loss, trapped in a dead-end situation: on the one hand, it cannot allow the financial crisis and inflation to further escalate, otherwise it will accelerate the collapse of the dollar and the Western world's monetary system centered on the dollar, thereby not only completely destroying the U.S.'s hegemony in the Western world but also possibly leading to a repeat of the economic crisis that engulfed the entire capitalist world from 1929 to 1933; on the other hand, if "austerity" measures are taken to ease the financial crisis and inflation, it will inevitably make the U.S. economy, which is already stagnating despite hundreds of billions of dollars in military orders, even worse, thereby accelerating the arrival of the overproduction crisis. Various signs indicate that the real danger of the convergence of financial and overproduction crises is increasingly seriously threatening U.S. imperialism.

    侵越战争无底洞消耗美帝有限的财力物力
    美国国内财政危机日见严重
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：日益沉重的侵越战争负担严重地消耗了美帝国主义有限的财力、物力，使美国国内财政危机日益加深，通货膨胀空前严重。美国统治集团陷入了焦头烂额、一筹莫展的狼狈境地。
              战费庞大赤字增加
    自从一九六五年夏天美帝国主义悍然把侵越战争大大“升级”以来，它投入南越战场的侵略军兵力已经由四万五千人增加到目前的将近五十五万人；同期内直接用于侵越战争的预算开支也相应地由一亿多美元猛增到三百多亿美元（据美国报刊估计，美国侵越战争的实际开支早在去年内就已达到每年四百亿美元的规模）。这样庞大的战费开支，使美国财政陷入了日益严重的危机，财政赤字节节上升。在刚刚结束的一九六七——一九六八财政年度内，美国联邦政府财政赤字高达二百五十四亿美元，创造了战后历年来的最高纪录。
              滥发钞票物价飞涨
    为了弥补亏空，美国统治集团拚命滥发公债、滥发钞票，引起了国内空前严重的通货膨胀。根据官方发表的数字，在截至今年四月为止的一年内，美国联邦政府增发的新公债总值达二百亿美元；接着在五月份一个月内又增发新公债五十四亿美元，使国债总和达到了三千五百二十九亿美元的新高峰。通货膨胀的速度也很惊人，一九六七年内美国国内的通货供应量（即货币流通量加上银行活期存款总额）比前一年扩大了百分之六点五，总额达到一千八百一十三亿美元；今年上半年的通货供应量又增加了五十九亿美元，相当于一九六六年全年增加数字（三十六亿美元）的一点六倍多。这种猛增的速度是战后所未见的。
    通货加速膨胀的直接后果是物价上涨越来越猛烈。美国一家银行在五月份发表的报告中不安地承认，自从去年年底以来，美国生活费用的上涨幅度事实上已经达到每年上涨百分之四点四左右。这个上涨幅度几乎相当于侵越战争大“升级”之前的一九六○年到一九六五年初期间平均每年上涨幅度（百分之一点二）的四倍。今年六、七两个月的物价上涨幅度又有进一步的增长，打破了十一年来的最高纪录。同劳动人民关系最密切的食物、衣着及医药费用等项涨价特别猛烈。据《美国新闻与世界报道》不久前透露，最近两年来，美国的食物和衣服价格有的上涨百分之十以上；公共汽车票价上涨了百分之九；医院住院费甚至上涨了百分之三十六。
             销路困难危机重重
    物价飞涨的结果进一步削弱了广大劳动群众原来就有限的购买力，加剧了许多工业部门的销路困难，使爆发生产过剩危机的条件更趋成熟。在这同时，它还直接削弱了美国商品在国内外市场上的竞争能力，使得今年以来美国出口的增长速度远远赶不上进口的增长。在三月、五月和六月，美国的对外贸易甚至连续出现逆差，引起了美国垄断资本的严重不安。美国统治集团一向依靠在国外倾销商品获得的对外贸易顺差来弥补一部分国际收支赤字，以支撑摇摇欲坠的美元地位。如今，在遭到了今年资本主义世界四十年来最大的金融危机的打击之后，美元地位更加岌岌可危，外贸情况的好坏对于美元地位的安危具有了更加重要的关系。但是，尽管约翰逊政府自年初以来就千方百计地鼓励出口，今年头七个月内美国对外贸易顺差却仍然锐减到只剩四亿六千三百多万美元，而去年同期的外贸顺差是二十六亿美元。
            束手无策日子难过
    面对着财政经济上的重重困难，美国统治集团束手无策，陷入了进退维谷的死胡同：一方面，它不能听任财政危机和通货膨胀进一步加剧，否则就会加速美元和以美元为中心的西方世界货币体系的崩溃，从而将不仅使美国在西方世界的霸权地位彻底完蛋，而且很可能会导致一九二九——一九三三年波及整个资本主义世界的经济大危机的重演；但是，另一方面，如果为了缓和财政危机和通货膨胀而采取“紧缩”措施，却又不可避免地会使目前尽管有数百亿美元军火订货的“刺激”而仍然日趋停滞的美国经济更加糟糕，从而将加速生产过剩危机的到来。种种迹象表明，财政金融危机和生产过剩危机交集迸发的现实危险正日益严重地威胁着美国帝国主义。
