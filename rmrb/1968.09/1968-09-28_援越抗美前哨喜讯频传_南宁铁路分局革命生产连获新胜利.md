The Nanning Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee, established nearly two months ago, has, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and a series of latest instructions. It insists on using revolution to lead production, and revolution and production have continuously achieved new victories, presenting a vibrant and inspiring situation everywhere.

The entire line of the Nanning Railway Bureau is a major artery for transportation in southern China, located in a key strategic position on the frontline of national defense, and is responsible for the glorious task of supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. During the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff of the Nanning Railway Bureau and the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops stationed at the bureau, always remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," have, through fierce struggles with a handful of class enemies, successfully established the bureau's Revolutionary Committee in early August this year. The newly born Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the leftist support troops, has vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, fiercely fought against the enemy, and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire bureau better and better. Currently, 128 grassroots units in the entire bureau have established Revolutionary Committees, Revolutionary Leadership Groups, or Production Promotion Leadership Groups. A great wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is surging across the entire bureau.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, various production and transportation task indicators have risen sharply month by month. Compared to July, the average daily loading volume in August increased by 27.5%, the daily unloading volume increased by 49%, and the number of trains operated increased by 13%. The various task indicators for September have also shown significant increases compared to August.

At the same time, through revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary staff have reformed some unreasonable regulations and improved the efficiency of locomotives, creating many new records of overloading and overlength.
