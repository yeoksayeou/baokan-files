	The Heroine's Hometown Transformed
	— A Visit to the Hometown of Albanian Heroine Shkuta Parllavata

	In the northeastern part of the Shkodër District in northern Albania, two tributaries of the Drin River, the Shkumbin and Kir Rivers, flow through the majestic and picturesque Alps, forming two parallel valleys. In these two beautiful valleys, twenty-two villages of varying sizes are scattered, home to over eleven thousand brave and hardworking people. This is the hometown of Shkuta Parllavata, the heroine who sacrificed her life in the construction of the Logoreci-Fieri railway not long ago—Dukagjin.

	The reporter, with a heart full of respect, visited the heroine's hometown.

	The Spring of Socialism

	The people of Dukagjin have historically suffered from the barbaric invasions of foreign aggressors and the cruel oppression and exploitation of local feudal lords and reactionary churches. They have lived in poverty for generations, with farmers only able to eat for three or four months each year. Before liberation, there were no schools or hospitals, and ninety-nine percent of the residents were illiterate.

	In November 1944, the people of Dukagjin, like the rest of Albania, were liberated under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania. Since then, their lives have improved day by day. Especially after the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the appearance of this village has undergone even greater changes. In the winter of 1966, the entire village, under the guidance of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings on "The only path for socialist construction in the countryside is agricultural collectivization," quickly established sixteen agricultural cooperatives, proudly achieving full agricultural collectivization in the village.

	On February 6, 1967, Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered an important speech on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the Government." Under the call of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people launched a magnificent mass movement to combat religious superstition, backward customs, bureaucracy, and to liberate women. The people of Dukagjin, together with the rest of the nation, actively participated in this movement. They used big-character posters, struggle meetings, and other forms to fight against the heinous counter-revolutionaries who hid behind religious cloaks; they criticized unreasonable marriage systems and some feudal and backward customs.

	Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of women in Dukagjin broke free from the shackles of feudal and patriarchal forces, actively participated in social activities and collective production, and became a powerful force in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas. Now, in all eighteen agricultural cooperatives in the village, 360 women and young women have taken on various levels of leadership; hundreds of young women have successively participated in voluntary labor for the Durrës-Malësi e Madhe highway and the Logoreci-Fieri railway project. In these great schools of communism, they have received excellent training.

	Revolution Nurtures New People

	Shkuta Parllavata was the daughter of a poor peasant family in the village of Peçaj in Dukagjin. She excelled in her studies and actively participated in social activities during her primary school years. After graduating from primary school, she worked in the agricultural cooperative. She was diligent in her work and very protective of collective property. Once, on a snowy winter day, the young Shkuta, to save the community's sheep, braved the wind and snow and cold to go down the mountain to collect fodder.

	In the autumn of 1967, the agricultural cooperative called for a group of young women to participate in the voluntary labor for the construction of the railway. Shkuta was the first to sign up. She always took on the heaviest tasks in her work and was awarded the title of "Shock Worker" four times in less than half a month. In an accident where the soil collapsed, Shkuta unfortunately sustained severe injuries and sacrificed her life.

	After Shkuta's sacrifice, her father, Parllava, was both saddened by the loss of his daughter and proud that his daughter had listened to the Party and given her life for the cause of socialist construction in the motherland. Soon, Parllava brought his niece, Katerina, to the railway construction site, picked up the pickaxe his daughter had used, and decided to complete the unfinished work of his daughter. Shkuta and her father Parllava's heroic actions in loyalty to the Party and the cause of socialism were highly praised by the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Comrade Enver Hoxha wrote a letter of commendation to them and personally received Parllava. When we visited Parllava's home this time, as soon as we entered the door, we saw a large photograph of Comrade Enver Hoxha receiving Parllava on the wall. We also saw a photograph of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha warmly shaking hands, symbolizing the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, sent by the Chinese Red Guards, and a letter of condolence written to him.

	The Heroine's Hometown Transformed

	After Shkuta's sacrifice, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania made a special resolution, posthumously recognizing the fifteen-year-old Shkuta as a formal member of the Party of Labour of Albania. This news spread to Dukagjin, and immediately, the youth and residents of the entire village launched a movement to learn from the hero's example, further promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

	From the winter of 1966 to the spring of 1967, the broad masses of cooperative members braved the biting cold wind, shoveled through more than two meters of accumulated snow, melted the ice on the ground with fire, and reclaimed 234 hectares of wasteland, equivalent to the total amount of wasteland reclaimed in this village since liberation. In the first year of agricultural collectivization, Dukagjin witnessed a historical miracle—grain self-sufficiency. The average yield of corn per unit area increased from about twenty quintals per hectare to thirty quintals.

	When we climbed to a high vantage point and surveyed the terraced fields on both sides of the Shkumbin Valley, we could see fields of corn and flocks of fat sheep grazing on the lush green slopes. The cooperative members were working diligently in the fields. They were full of confidence in a bumper harvest, ensuring that the average yield of corn per unit area this year would increase from last year's thirty quintals to thirty-five quintals, and striving to achieve forty quintals per hectare on a quarter of the corn planting area.

	With the development of socialist collective production, the lives of the cooperative members have improved day by day. In recent years, many cooperative members have built new houses. At the beginning of this year, the family of the female hero Shkuta also moved into a new house built by local youth through voluntary labor. Now, every agricultural cooperative in the village has a primary school and a health station, and the village center has established an eight-year school, a hospital including a maternity ward, and a bakery. When we arrived at the newly built beautiful and spacious cultural palace, we saw in the reading room the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao on display. Here, the various documents of the Party of Labour of Albania and many works of Comrade Enver Hoxha are also on display. These books and documents have become the daily spiritual sustenance of the broad masses of cooperative members.

	The Party of Labour of Albania and the government pay great attention to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the mountainous rural areas, and various places have sent cadres, technical personnel, medical staff, and supplied seeds, fertilizers, building materials, etc. to Dukagjin. Now, in Dukagjin, there are more than a dozen cadres, doctors, and teachers who have been sent down from the cities. They are fighting together with the mountain farmers to develop the socialist construction in the mountainous areas. More than a dozen workers from Shkodër are working day and night to build a small diesel-powered power station for Dukagjin.

    英雄故乡换新貌
    ——访阿尔巴尼亚女英雄什库塔·帕尔·瓦塔的家乡
    在阿尔巴尼亚北方斯库台区东北部，北方最大的河流德林河的两条支流——夏列斯河和基尔河流经巍峨秀丽的阿尔卑斯群山，形成了两条平行的峡谷。在这两个美丽的峡谷中间，疏疏落落地分布着大小二十二个村庄，居住着一万一千多勇敢勤劳的人民。这就是不久前在建设洛格齐恩—费里铁路中光荣牺牲的女英雄什库塔·帕尔·瓦塔的家乡——杜卡杰尼乡。记者怀着崇敬的心情，访问了英雄的家乡。
      社会主义的春天
    杜卡杰尼乡的人民历史上深受外国侵略者的野蛮侵略和本国封建主与反动教会的残酷压迫和剥削，他们世世代代过着贫穷生活，每年，农民们只能吃上三、四个月的粮食。解放前，这里没有学校，没有医院，百分之九十九的居民是文盲。
    一九四四年十一月，杜卡杰尼乡人民同阿尔巴尼亚全国人民一样，在劳动党的领导下，得到了解放。从此，人民的生活一天比一天好起来。特别在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会以后，这个乡的面貌发生了更大的变化。一九六六年冬，全乡在阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的“农村社会主义建设的唯一道路是农业集体化”的教导下，迅速成立了十六个农业合作社，光荣地实现了全乡农业合作化。
    一九六七年二月六日，霍查同志发表了“党和政权的进一步革命化”的重要讲话。阿尔巴尼亚全国人民在霍查同志的号召下，又掀起了一个反对宗教迷信、落后习俗和官僚主义，以及解放妇女的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。杜卡杰尼乡的人民，同全国人民一道，积极投入了这个运动。他们用大字报、斗争大会等各种形式，斗争了罪大恶极、披着宗教外衣的反革命分子；批判了不合理的婚姻制度和一些封建落后习俗。
    杜卡杰尼乡广大妇女在党的领导下，冲破了封建和宗法势力的束缚，积极参加社会活动和集体生产，成了农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一支巨大力量。现在，在全乡十八个农业合作社中，已经有三百六十名妇女和女青年担任了各级领导工作；有数百名女青年先后参加了大马勒西亚公路和洛格齐恩—费里铁路工程的义务劳动。在这些共产主义大学校里，得到了很好的锻炼。
        革命育新人
    什库塔·帕尔·瓦塔是杜卡杰尼乡佩恰伊村一个贫苦农民家的女儿。她在小学学习时，成绩优异，积极参加社会活动。小学毕业后，就在农业合作社劳动。她劳动积极，并且十分爱护集体财产。一次，在一个暴风雪的冬日里，小小的什库塔为了社里的羊群，冒着风雪和严寒，下山去收饲料。
    一九六七年秋天，农业合作社号召一批女青年去参加建设铁路的义务劳动。什库塔第一个报了名。她在劳动中总是抢重活干，在不到半个月的劳动中，四次荣获“突击手”称号。在一次土方倒塌的事故中，什库塔不幸受重伤，光荣牺牲了。
    什库塔牺牲后，她的父亲帕尔一方面为失去女儿而悲痛，同时又以自己的女儿听党的话，为祖国社会主义建设事业献出了生命而自豪。不久，帕尔带着自己的侄女卡捷琳娜来到铁路建设工地，拿起他女儿用过的镐，决心完成女儿生前未竟的事业。什库塔和她父亲帕尔忠于党和社会主义事业的英勇行动，受到了阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志的热情赞扬。霍查同志写信表扬了他们，并且亲自接见了帕尔同志。我们这次到帕尔同志的家里访问时，一进门就看到了墙上挂着霍查同志接见帕尔同志的大幅照片。我们还看到了中国红卫兵寄给帕尔同志的象征着中阿人民革命战斗友谊的毛主席和霍查同志亲切握手的照片和写给他的慰问信。
        英雄故乡换新貌
    什库塔牺牲后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央作出了特别决议，追认十五岁的什库塔为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正式党员。这一消息传到杜卡杰尼乡后，全乡青年和居民立即掀起了学习英雄榜样的运动，进一步促进了人的思想革命化。
    一九六六年冬到一九六七年春，广大社员迎着刺骨的寒风，翻开两米多深的积雪，用火融化了地面的冰层，开垦了荒地二百三十四公顷，这相当于这个乡解放以来开垦荒地的总和。在农业合作化的头一年，杜卡杰尼乡出现了历史上的奇迹——粮食自给了。玉米平均单位面积产量从每公顷二十几公担提高到三十公担。
    当我们攀登高处，了望夏列斯河谷两旁的层层梯田时，可以看到一片片的玉米地和放牧在绿草如茵的山坡上的肥壮羊群。社员们正在田间辛勤劳动。他们充满着丰收的信心，保证今年玉米平均单位面积产量要从去年的三十公担提高到三十五公担，并且争取在四分之一的玉米播种面积上每公顷收获四十公担。
    随着社会主义集体生产的发展，社员们的生活也一天天提高。近年来，许多社员盖了新屋。今年年初，女英雄什库塔的家也搬进了当地青年用义务劳动为他们修建的新屋。现在，全乡每个农业社都有一所小学和卫生站，乡中心还设立了一所八年制学校、一所包括妇产院的医院和一个面包房。当我们来到新建的美丽宽敞的文化宫的时候，看见阅览室里陈列着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作，这里还陈列着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的各种文件和霍查同志的许多著作。这些书籍和文件已成为广大社员日常必需的精神食粮。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府十分关怀山区农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，各地大力向杜卡杰尼乡输送干部、技术人员、医务人员和供应良种、化肥、建筑材料等。现在，在杜卡杰尼乡，有十几名从城市下放来的干部、医生和教师，他们为发展山区的社会主义建设事业，同山区农民共同奋斗。从斯库台市来的十几名工人正在日夜加工，为杜卡杰尼乡新建一所小型柴油机发电站而战斗。　（新华社记者）
