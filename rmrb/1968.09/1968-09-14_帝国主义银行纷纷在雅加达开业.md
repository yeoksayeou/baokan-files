Imperialist banks, led by the United States, have recently been establishing branches in Jakarta one after another.

According to reports, twelve banks from imperialist countries have recently obtained permission from the Suharto-Nasution sellout regime to set up branches in Jakarta. The first to gain this privilege were several American monopoly capital banks, which had already opened for business in the previous months and begun their nefarious activities of controlling Indonesia's finances and plundering its natural resources.

In the central district of Jakarta, there is a street called Tamrin Street. The various banks of American imperialism, such as the Bank of America, Citibank, and the Bank of America Express Company, have set up branches on this street, busily engaging in their blood-sucking and extortion activities.

The infiltration of imperialist bank capital into Indonesia is currently ongoing. On August 28, a Japanese bank just announced its opening in Jakarta. A week later, on September 4, a British bank also officially opened its doors for business in Jakarta. Banks from the Netherlands and West Germany are also set to open soon, and several banks from the Netherlands, West Germany, and Belgium will jointly establish a branch in Jakarta.

The influx of bank capital from imperialist countries led by the United States is a living testament to the imperialists' plundering of the Indonesian people and a living testament to the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime's betrayal of national interests.

    帝国主义银行纷纷在雅加达开业
    以美国为首的一些帝国主义国家的银行最近一个时期纷纷在雅加达建立分行，并且一个接着一个地开张营业。
    据报道，有十二个帝国主义国家的银行最近从苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权手中取得了在雅加达开设分行的权利。最先取得这种特权的是几家美国垄断资本的银行，它们在前几个月已经扬幡开张，开始了它们控制印尼财政金融，掠夺印尼自然资源的罪恶勾当。
    在雅加达中心区有一条大街，叫塔姆林大街。美帝国主义的各家银行，如美洲银行、花旗银行、美国捷运公司银行等在雅加达开设的分行，林立在这条大街上，紧张地进行着它们的吸血吮膏的活动。
    帝国主义银行资本侵入印尼的活动，目前还在发展中。八月二十八日，一家日本银行刚在雅加达宣布开张。一个星期之后，即九月四日，一家英国银行又在雅加达正式开门营业。即将在雅加达开张营业的还有荷兰的两家银行和西德的两家银行，荷兰、西德、比利时的几家银行还将在雅加达开设一个联合分行。
    以美国为首的帝国主义国家的银行资本纷纷侵入印尼，是这些帝国主义者掠夺印尼民族的活生生罪证，是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权出卖民族利益的活生生罪证。
