On the occasion of the nationwide military and civilian victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the color documentary film "Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" has been presented to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Let us enthusiastically cheer for the new victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, and cheer for another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

More than twenty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us that revolutionary literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers means wholeheartedly "singing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people," and it means striving to create images of workers, peasants, and soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Whether to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers or the bourgeoisie; whether to sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people or of the masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies—this is the fundamental issue in the struggle to the death between the two classes and two lines on the literary and artistic front.

"Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" is a thousand times good, ten thousand times good. It is good because it has, for the first time in history, made the piano, which has served the reactionary aristocracy and bourgeoisie for hundreds of years, shine brightly on the stage serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. It has made the piano, which was once used to sing praises for the exploiters' masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies, today pour out all its passion to deeply, perfectly, and movingly create the towering images of the working-class heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei. Listen, the keys no longer play the evil sounds of greedy and brutal exploiters, but like a machine gun turned around, it fires fiercely at those harmful creatures and bloodsuckers. Listen, the piano no longer conveys the decadent and declining "fin de siècle" mood of the dying capitalist system, but the strongest notes of the great era of Mao Zedong Thought! "The tiger crouches, the dragon coils, today surpassing yesterday, the earth turns over, the heavens shake, and the spirit is grand." This is an innovation in the history of art, a heaven-shaking and earth-moving transformation, and a great revolution in the realm of ideology where one class overthrows another.

"Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" is a magnificent ode to the revolutionary heroes of the Chinese working class. With full enthusiasm, mighty momentum, magnificent melody, and high-pitched tones, it depicts the heroic character of the revolutionary heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei, reveals their sublime spiritual world, achieves the unity of "revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form," and deeply moves and educates the broad audience.

"Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" boldly creates and innovates, breaking through the limitations of Peking opera plate music, and creates a musical theme that praises the working-class heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei who hold high the revolutionary red lantern. This musical theme develops and changes according to the different times, environments, and emotions of each segment, making the images of the heroes particularly prominent and towering. For example, in the segment "One must be such a person," the prelude uses a lyrical approach to create a segment with singing characteristics, vividly depicting the moving scene of Grandma telling Tiemei about the red lantern and the family history of revolutionary struggle, preparing the audience emotionally for Tiemei's singing, and bringing the audience into a sublime realm before the performance. In the segment "Ambition soars to the sky," the prelude uses clanging sounds and heavy rhythms to express Li Yuhe's fearlessness and dignity in the face of danger in the enemy's heavily guarded prison. At the end of this segment of magnificent and heroic singing, the piano, with its powerful momentum, broad rhythm, and splendid colors, further reveals Li Yuhe's heroic spirit of fighting to the death with the enemy and overcoming all enemies. Li Yuhe's towering heroic image standing under the enemy's bayonets vividly shows the noble qualities of the working class being "the most far-sighted, selfless, and most thorough in revolution," deeply infecting and educating us.

"Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" fully utilizes the piano's wide range, magnificent momentum, and rich expressiveness to perfectly depict the heroes' heroic character and spiritual appearance. In "Everyone has a bright red heart," the bright tone and rhythmic beats vividly depict Tiemei's innocent, lively, and pure character, as well as her strong longing for revolutionary truth. At the end of the prelude of "One must be such a person," the left hand uses the technique of continuously playing a single note to lead the audience into a scene of profound significance. When Tiemei sings the low and turning melody of "Why did they," the accompaniment part's depiction of Tiemei's inner activities after listening to the family history is extremely detailed: first, both hands play a soft melody to describe Tiemei's deep thought, then it turns into a passionate and rapid progression, powerfully leading to the next singing segment, "To save China, to save the poor, to defeat the enemy soldiers," accurately and layer by layer expressing Tiemei's excited feelings after seriously thinking and understanding the revolutionary truth. When singing "Tiemei, you should carry this eight hundred pounds," the piano fully renders Tiemei's surging revolutionary passion with a sudden and high-pitched melody. In the segment "Ambition soars to the sky," when Li Yuhe sings "To the execution ground, head held high, looking far ahead," the accompaniment uses a gentle melody to show Li Yuhe's boundless longing for the victory of the revolution, followed by a gradually accelerating and strengthening powerful momentum, expressing Li Yuhe's firm belief in the victory of the revolution. When singing "But wait for the wind and rain to pass, for the flowers to bloom, for the new China to be like the morning sun, shining on the world," the accompaniment, with abundant revolutionary optimism, bright and high-pitched tunes, reveals an infinitely magnificent and beautiful revolutionary prospect, expressing Li Yuhe's sublime revolutionary ideals and his loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause, daring to die for it.

The successful filming of the color documentary "Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'" quickly promotes this new variety of proletarian revolutionary art to hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is a great joy. The brilliant flower of proletarian revolutionary art, "Piano Accompanied 'The Red Lantern'," will bloom across the country with the screening of the film; the heroic image of the Chinese working class, Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei, will meet with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses through the screen, which will undoubtedly have a broader and deeper impact. We, the revolutionary cultural workers of the army, are determined to learn from Comrade Jiang Qing, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, to strive to create artistic works that are worthy of our era!

    工人阶级的英雄颂歌
    ——赞彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》
    广州部队文体战士
    在全国军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，欢度伟大祖国十九周年国庆的大喜日子里，彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》同广大工农兵观众见面了。让我们热烈欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的新胜利，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果！
    早在二十多年前，伟大领袖毛主席就教导我们，革命的文学艺术必须为工农兵服务。为工农兵服务，就必须满腔热忱地“歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”，就必须全力以赴塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄形象。为工农兵服务，还是为资产阶级服务；歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民，还是歌颂老爷、太太、公子、小姐们，这是文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线生死搏斗的根本问题。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》一千个好，一万个好，好就好在它使数百年来一直为反动的贵族资产阶级服务的钢琴，开天辟地第一回英姿焕发地登上了为工农兵服务的舞台；使得过去一向被用来为剥削阶级的老爷太太少爷小姐唱赞美诗的钢琴，今天以全副的热情，深刻、完美而动人地塑造了工人阶级的英雄战士李玉和、李铁梅的高大形象。听，琴键上弹奏出来的不再是那些贪婪残暴的剥削者的罪恶之声，而象一架掉转了枪口的机关枪，朝着那些害人虫、吸血鬼猛烈开火。听，琴音里传出的不再是垂死的资本主义制度的颓废、没落的“世纪末”情调，而是毛泽东思想伟大时代的最强音！“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”这是艺术史上的创举，这是天翻地覆的变革，这是一场意识形态领域中的一个阶级推翻一个阶级的伟大的革命。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》是一曲中国工人阶级革命英雄形象的壮丽颂歌。它以饱满的热情，磅礴的气势，壮美的旋律，高昂的音调，刻划了革命英雄李玉和、李铁梅的英雄性格，展现了他们崇高的精神世界，达到了“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”，深深地激动着、教育着广大观众。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》以大胆创造、大胆革新的精神，突破了京剧板腔体音乐的局限性，创作了一个歌颂高擎革命红灯的工人阶级英雄人物李玉和、李铁梅的音乐主题。这一音乐主题随着各个段落不同的时间、环境和情绪，而作了相应的发展变化，使得英雄人物的形象十分突出，十分高大。例如在“做人要做这样的人”一段中，前奏以抒情的手法，构成了一个具有歌唱性特点的段落，形象地描绘了奶奶对铁梅说红灯、讲革命斗争家史的动人情景，为下面铁梅的唱腔作了情感上的准备，在演唱之前就把听众带入了一个崇高的境界。在“雄心壮志冲云天”一段中，前奏以铿锵的音响，沉重的节奏，表现了李玉和身在敌人戒备森严的监牢而临危不惧、大义凛然的崇高的革命气节。在这一段雄伟豪迈的唱腔的结尾，钢琴以强大的声势，宽广的节奏，辉煌的色彩，进一步展现了李玉和誓与敌人血战到底、压倒一切敌人的英雄气概。李玉和在敌人的刺刀下巍然屹立的高大英雄形象，突出地表现了“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性”的高贵品质，使我们受到了极其强烈的感染和深刻的教育。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》充分地发挥了钢琴音域宽广、气势宏伟、表现力丰富的特点，完美地刻划了英雄人物的英雄性格与精神面貌。在“都有一颗红亮的心”中，明亮的音色，跳动的节奏，生动地描绘了铁梅的天真、活泼而纯朴的性格，以及她对革命真理的强烈向往。在“做人要做这样的人”前奏的结尾，左手用连续弹奏一音的手法，把听众引进了一幅境界深远的画面之中。当铁梅唱到“他们到底为什么”这一个低回婉转的拖腔时，伴奏部分对铁梅听了家史后的内心活动的刻划是极其细致的：先是双手齐奏柔和的旋律，描写铁梅的沉思，继而转入热情奔放的快速进行，有力地引出了下面的“为的是救中国、救穷人，打败鬼子兵”一段唱腔，准确而有层次地表达了铁梅经过认真思考悟出了革命道理后的激动心情。当唱到“铁梅你，应该挑上这八百斤”时，钢琴以急骤高昂的旋律，把铁梅当时澎湃如潮涌的革命豪情充分渲染出来了。在“雄心壮志冲云天”一段中，当李玉和唱到“赴刑场，气昂昂，抬头远看”时，伴奏用一段悠扬的旋律展示了李玉和对革命胜利前景的无限向往，接着又以逐渐加快逐渐加强的巨大声势，表现了李玉和对革命胜利的坚强信念。当唱到“但等那，风雨过，百花吐艳，新中国，似朝阳，光照人间”时，伴奏以充沛的革命乐观主义的情感，明朗高昂的曲调，展现了无限壮丽、无限美好的革命前景，抒发了李玉和崇高的革命理想和为无产阶级革命事业赴汤蹈火，视死如归的赤胆忠心。
    彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》的拍摄成功，把无产阶级革命文艺的这一新品种迅速地推广到亿万工农兵中去，这是一件大喜事。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这朵鲜艳的无产阶级革命文艺鲜花，将随着影片的放映，在祖国各地盛开；中国工人阶级的英雄形象李玉和、李铁梅通过银幕同亿万革命群众见面，必将产生更广泛、更深远的影响。我们部队的革命文艺工作者决心向江青同志学习，在毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉指引下，努力创造出无愧于我们时代的文艺作品来！
