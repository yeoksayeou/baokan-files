The Yangtze River surges with waves of joy, and the Kunlun Mountains echo with songs of praise: we sing of Mao Zedong Thought, which has blown like a spring breeze across the five continents and four seas, and we praise Mao Zedong Thought, whose sunlight shines over a red China! From the revolutionary storm that swept the banks of the Huangpu River yesterday, to the birth of the revolutionary committees in Tibet and Xinjiang today, it is the great helmsman Chairman Mao who leads us forward to victory! Revolutionary fighters are the guardians of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary fighters are the vanguard of the Mao Zedong era. Uproot the cancer of "self," build the Great Wall of "public," smash the nest of "revisionism," and scale the peak of "loyalty." Follow the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the revolutionary banner, use the gun and the pen to defend the revolutionary committees, and let the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shine over a red world!

    毛泽东思想普天照
    驻新北大工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    王代陈　刘赞兵扬子江喜浪翻滚，昆仑山赞歌飞涌：歌唱毛泽东思想春风吹遍了五洲四海，赞颂毛泽东思想阳光普照祖国一片红！从昨天黄浦江畔掀起一月革命的风暴，看今日西藏、新疆革命委员会诞生，是伟大的舵手毛主席啊，领导我们胜利前进！革命战士是毛泽东思想的
  卫士，革命战士是毛泽东时代的
  尖兵。拔掉“私”字的毒瘤，筑起“公”字的长城，砸烂“修”字的温床，攀上“忠”字的顶峰。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，革命大旗手中擎，用钢枪和铁笔捍卫革命委员会，让毛泽东思想的阳光普照世界一片红！
