The capital's more than 500 industrial enterprises, while sending batches of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to march into schools, have seen the broad masses of workers remaining in the factories, with a strong sense of responsibility as the "leading class" and high political enthusiasm, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have proactively taken on the dual burdens of revolution and production, using revolution to lead production, overcoming difficulties such as reduced personnel and high temperatures, and exceeding the production targets for August. Some factories and mines have achieved the highest production levels since their establishment. Preliminary statistics show that the city's total output value for August increased by about 10% compared to July.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao warmly received the representatives of the capital's working class and the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which greatly inspired the broad masses of workers in the capital. Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," the working class of the capital, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, formed dozens of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, which marched into various schools in batches to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation there. The broad masses of workers remaining in the factories have written letters of resolve, expressing their determination not to disappoint the great concern and expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao, to grasp revolution and promote production, and to support their class brothers who go to schools to propagate Mao Zedong Thought with practical actions, becoming their strong rear guard. Currently, many factories and enterprises that have sent Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, such as the Beijing Knitting General Factory, Beijing New China Printing Factory, Beijing Chemical Factory No. 3, Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory, and Beijing Railway Bureau, are seeing waves of revolution surging higher and higher, with frequent reports of production victories. Many factories and enterprises have seen scenes where one worker can do the work of several, with different trades cooperating and supporting each other, fully demonstrating the boundless loyalty of the capital's working class to Chairman Mao. They are indeed the vanguard of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the model of fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and the exemplar of grasping revolution and promoting production. The Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, despite a 10% reduction in personnel and a significant increase in production tasks, insisted on using revolution to lead production, emphasizing proletarian politics, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. They exceeded the targets for printing Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," among other major tasks. In late August, the factory accepted the tasks of printing the second issue of "Red Flag" magazine and the ninth issue of "People's Pictorial," which were not only large in quantity but also required high speed and quality. The printers who undertook these two tasks gathered by the machines late that night to hold a big criticism meeting and a bitter-sweet reminiscence meeting. The workers studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, angrily exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory who had suppressed the workers for many years, using the revisionist "bonus as the commander" to corrupt the workers. This further strengthened their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and further ignited their revolutionary spirit. That very night, they launched into the printing work. During the printing process, whenever they encountered difficulties, they would line up in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and loudly read the quotation: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Each workshop also organized Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to encourage each other, promote production, and ultimately completed these two production tasks with high speed and quality. The Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, while actively selecting outstanding workers to go to schools to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, is also vigorously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory and promoting technological revolution. The entire factory, based on creating the highest production level in its history in July, saw its production in August increase further compared to July, and successfully produced three important new products. The Fengtai Locomotive Depot launched a revolutionary labor competition of "driving trains for the revolution" and "repairing trains for the revolution." Throughout the depot, the crew members and repair workers, in the hot month of August, continuously created new achievements in pulling more and faster and repairing vehicles. They also helped brother locomotive depots from other places to quickly and well repair two locomotives.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out big criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, transfer office personnel to the front lines, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and transformation generally go through these stages." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class of the capital is determined, under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to fight a brilliant battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary committees of various factories have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary big criticism, actively launching fierce attacks on class enemies, and combining the cleanup of class ranks with party rectification and streamlining and downsizing. They have vigorously launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories, both vigorously and practically. The workers say, "Chairman Mao is backing us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory and turn the factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school." The workers of the Beijing Low-Voltage Electrical Appliances Factory, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed the work of their factory, further launching the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary big criticism. So far, the factory's team-level criticism has been conducted more than 700 times, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents, and exposing deeply hidden class enemies. At the same time, in conjunction with the cleanup of class ranks, they carried out the work of streamlining and downsizing, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist management system that restricts the development of productive forces, reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, making the entire factory present a revolutionary and vigorous, and productive and thriving new situation. The Beijing Knitting General Factory sent a relatively large number of workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. A small handful of class enemies took the opportunity to spread rumors and lies, saying, "The Knitting General Factory has stopped production," attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The workers remaining in the factory, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, heightened their revolutionary vigilance, grasped class struggle without wavering, achieved victory after victory in the revolution, and improved production step by step. They completed the production tasks five and a half days ahead of schedule in August, smashing the plots of the class enemies. The revolutionary committees at various levels of the Beijing Railway Bureau fully mobilized the wisdom of the masses and respected the pioneering spirit of the masses. In the past month, they have broken through many old frameworks and foreign dogmas that restrict the development of productive forces, reformed many unreasonable regulations and systems, established some new systems adapted to the development of productive forces, and fostered a revolutionary new style, powerfully promoting transportation production. In August, this bureau loaded 1,500 more cars and unloaded 1,800 more cars compared to July.

The capital's working class, which achieved a double harvest of revolution and production in August, is currently continuing to select outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and, in a planned and step-by-step manner, enter all units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They will lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation there, making the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in these battlefields.

    首都工人阶级主动挑起革命生产两副重担
    坚决支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校
    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署掀起斗批改新高潮，决心把工矿企业的文化大革命进行到底；互相协作互相支援，克服各种困难，超额完成了八月份生产任务
    新华社一日讯　首都五百多个工矿企业在抽出一批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队浩浩荡荡开进学校的同时，留在工厂的广大工人群众，怀着“工人阶级是领导阶级”的高度责任感和饱满的政治热情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，主动地挑起革命和生产两副重担，以革命统帅生产，战胜了人员减少和高温季节等各种困难，超额完成了八月份生产任务。有些厂矿创造了建厂以来的最高生产水平。据初步统计，全市八月份总产值比七月份增长了百分之十左右。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲切接见首都工人阶级代表和毛主席最新指示的发表，极大地鼓舞了首都广大工人群众。遵照毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大教导，首都工人阶级同解放军战士，组成数十支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，一批批地开进各学校，领导那里的斗批改。留在厂里的广大工人群众纷纷写决心书，表示决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的伟大关怀和殷切期望，要狠抓革命，猛促生产，以实际行动支持去各学校宣传毛泽东思想的阶级兄弟，做他们的坚强后盾。目前，北京针织总厂、北京新华印刷厂、北京化工三厂、北京第一机床厂、北京第二机床厂、北京光华木材厂、北京铁路分局等派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队的许多厂矿企业里，革命一浪高过一浪，生产捷报频传。许多工矿企业出现了一个工人顶几个工人，工种之间互相协作、互相支援的生动场面，充分显示了无限忠于毛主席的首都工人阶级，不愧是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的先锋，是全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的表率，是狠抓革命、猛促生产的模范。北京新华印刷厂革命委员会在厂里人员减少百分之十、生产任务大大增加的情况下，坚持用革命统帅生产，突出无产阶级政治，充分发挥群众的积极性，超额完成了印制毛主席的革命宝书和革命油画《毛主席去安源》等项重大任务。八月下旬，这个厂接受了印制《红旗》杂志第二期和《人民画报》第九期两项任务，不但数量大，而且要求印制速度快、质量高。承担这两项任务的印刷工人，在接到任务的当天深夜，聚集在机器旁举行大批判会和忆苦思甜会。工人们学习毛主席的最新指示，愤怒地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工厂的代理人多年来压制工人，用修正主义的“奖金挂帅”来腐蚀工人的滔天罪行，更加增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，进一步激发了革命干劲，当夜就投入印制工作。在印制过程中，他们遇到困难，就列队在毛主席像前高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”各个车间还组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，相互鼓干劲，促生产，终于高速度、高质量地完成了这两项生产任务。北京第一机床厂一面积极选派优秀工人到学校领导斗、批、改，一面大搞本厂斗、批、改，大搞技术革命。全厂在七月份创造建厂以来最高生产水平的基础上，八月份的生产比七月份又有所增长，并制成了三种重要新产品。丰台机务段开展了“为革命开火车”、“为革命检修火车”的革命劳动竞赛，全段乘务人员和机修工人在炎热的八月份，不断创造多拉快跑和检修车辆的新成绩，并且帮助外地的兄弟机务段又快又好地检修了两台机车。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”首都工人阶级在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统一号令下，打一场斗、批、改的漂亮仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。各厂革命委员会举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，并且把清理阶级队伍和整党、精兵简政结合起来，既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实地掀起了工厂斗、批、改新高潮。工人们说，毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气，搞好工厂里的斗、批、改，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。北京低压电器厂职工学习了毛主席最新指示，对照检查本厂的工作，进一步掀起无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，深入持久地开展革命的大批判。到目前为止，这个厂的班组大批判已进行了七百多次，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线批得臭不可闻，挖出了埋藏得很深的阶级敌人。同时，结合清理阶级队伍，开展了精兵简政工作，彻底批判束缚生产力发展的修正主义管理体制，改革不合理的规章制度，使全厂呈现出革命热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上的新局面。北京针织总厂抽出了比较多的工人参加了工人毛泽东思想宣传队。一小撮阶级敌人乘机煽阴风，点鬼火，造谣说“针织总厂停产了”，妄图破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。留在厂里的工人们，怀着对毛主席的一片忠心，百倍提高革命警惕性，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，革命节节胜利，生产步步提高，八月份又提前五天半完成了生产任务，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。北京铁路分局所属的各级革委会，充分发挥群众的智慧，尊重群众的首创精神，最近一个月来破除了许多束缚生产力发展的旧框框、洋教条，改革了许多不合理的规章制度，制定了一些适应生产力发展的新制度，树立了革命化的新作风，有力地推动了运输生产。八月份这个局比七月份多装了一千五百车，多卸了一千八百车。
    取得八月份革命、生产双丰收的首都工人阶级，目前正在继续选派优秀的工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，有计划、有步骤地进驻一切没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，领导那里的斗、批、改，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在这些阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
