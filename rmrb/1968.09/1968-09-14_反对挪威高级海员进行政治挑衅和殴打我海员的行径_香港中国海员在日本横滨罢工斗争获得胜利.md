The fourteen Chinese patriotic sailors from Hong Kong on the Norwegian cargo ship "Japana," which was docked in the port of Yokohama, Japan, have won their struggle against the political provocations and assaults by Norwegian senior sailors.

Since September 7, these fourteen Chinese sailors have been on strike to protest the barbaric actions of the Norwegian second officer on the "Japana," who threw the Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," into the sea and assaulted the Chinese sailors. The patriotic overseas Chinese in Yokohama and Tokyo, as well as members of the Kanagawa Prefecture Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), have resolutely supported the struggle of the Chinese patriotic sailors and have joined them in the fight.

Under the resolute struggle of the Chinese patriotic sailors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the captain of the "Japana" and the Norwegian consul in Yokohama were forced to accept most of the demands put forward by the Chinese sailors.

On September 12, the captain of the "Japana" handed over a letter of apology signed by the Norwegian consul to the Chinese sailors. In the letter, he expressed regret for the Norwegian second officer's insult to the Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and was forced to order the two Norwegian assailants off the ship. He also agreed to have the Norwegian shipping company pay the Chinese sailors their wages and other expenses during the strike period.

The Chinese sailors, together with the patriotic overseas Chinese in Yokohama and members of the Kanagawa Prefecture Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), held a meeting in Yokohama on the evening of September 12 to celebrate the victory of this struggle. A representative of the Chinese sailors said at the meeting: "This victory was achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. It proves that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Upon returning to Hong Kong, we will continue to fight against imperialism and colonialism, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

    反对挪威高级海员进行政治挑衅和殴打我海员的行径
    香港中国海员在日本横滨罢工斗争获得胜利
    中国海员回到香港后将继续同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争
    新华社十三日讯　据东方通讯社报道：停泊在日本横滨港的来自香港的挪威货船“贾帕纳号”上的十四名中国爱国海员，反对挪威高级海员向他们进行政治挑衅和殴打的斗争，取得了胜利。
    这十四名中国海员从九月七日以来一直在坚持罢工斗争，抗议“贾帕纳号”船上的挪威二副把红色宝书《毛主席语录》扔到海里和殴打中国海员的野蛮行动。横滨和东京的爱国华侨以及神奈川县日中友好协会（正统）的会员坚决支持中国爱国海员的这场斗争，并且和中国海员一起进行斗争。
    在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国爱国海员的坚决斗争下，“贾帕纳号”船长和挪威驻横滨领事被迫接受了中国海员提出的大部分要求。
      “贾帕纳号”船长十二日把一封有挪威领事签字的道歉信交给了中国海员，他在道歉信里，对挪威二副侮辱红色宝书《毛主席语录》的行为表示歉意，并且不得不勒令两名行凶的挪威人离船，同时答应由挪威航运公司付给中国海员在罢工期间的工资和其他费用。
    中国海员同横滨爱国华侨和神奈川县日中友好协会（正统）会员一起，十二日晚在横滨举行集会，庆祝这次斗争的胜利。中国海员代表在会上讲话说：“这次斗争的胜利是在毛泽东思想指引下取得的。这证明，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。回到香港后，我们将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争。”
