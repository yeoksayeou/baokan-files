The working class must lead everything, the working class can lead everything. The workers of Huiyang Machinery Factory grasp technical leadership and create outstanding achievements.

Recently, after the revolutionary workers of the Huiyang Machinery Factory in Guangdong studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the leading role of the working class and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything," the entire factory held a summary meeting to review the outstanding achievements made in the past few years after the workers overcame numerous obstacles and seized the leadership of the technical research department to boldly carry out the technological revolution. The experience of the Huiyang Machinery Factory proves that the working class can lead both the political revolution and the technological revolution.

The Huiyang Machinery Factory is a manufacturer of agricultural machinery. With the rapid development of socialist construction in rural areas, the factory's production could not meet the needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. To meet the needs of rural socialist construction, the factory, under the urgent demand of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the workers, began to design and manufacture a machine tool. Due to the fact that some "technicians" regarded themselves as "scholars," long separated from the masses, believed in foreign textbooks, and worked in isolation, they spent a year and a half to produce a "gear hobbing machine tool," which broke down as soon as it was put into production, wasting a large amount of national resources and funds. In 1964, the workers in the factory proposed that the leadership of the technical research department of the machinery factory should be in the hands of the workers.

Since the workers took over the technical research department, they have achieved great success. For example, a second-class worker, Xiao Zuoqi, was an orphan who begged for ten years in the old society. Chairman Mao rescued him from the fire pit. After liberation, he studied at night school for three years. When he saw that some "technicians" were arrogant and incompetent, wasting a large amount of national resources, he was so angry that he gnashed his teeth. After the workers took over the technical research department, Xiao Zuoqi voluntarily proposed to design and manufacture a "single-arm vertical" machine tool that could produce agricultural products urgently needed. His proposal was supported by all the workers in the factory. However, when he started to draw the design drawings, he was ridiculed by some "technicians" in the factory, who said, "Who are you? You can't even recognize a few big characters, and you want to make big machines, and you want to manage the technical research department!" Xiao Zuoqi was very angry and said, "In the old society, I was a sufferer. Now I am the master of the country. For the benefit of the revolution, we workers must manage it!" Xiao Zuoqi, with his boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and a heart dedicated to serving the people, boldly led the design of this machine tool. He studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "What is work? Work is struggle" time and time again, working with his fellow workers, fearless of the ridicule and attacks of some "technicians," working day and night, discussing problems with everyone, holding symposiums, and consulting with old workers. He drew the drawings every night until two in the morning. One day, his wife saw him thin and said, "Wait until you draw the machine, you won't have a life." Xiao Zuoqi then studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "To struggle is to sacrifice" with his wife and recalled the bitterness and sweetness together. He said, "As long as I can serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, I will be content to die after the machine is made." With his red heart for the Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, after four months of arduous struggle, Xiao Zuoqi finally drew the complete drawings of the machine. With the support of all the workers in the factory, the "single-arm vertical" machine tool was successfully trial-produced in just seven and a half months and put into production. Its efficiency was six times higher than the original machine tool, and the quality was also very good. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xiao Zuoqi also led the design and manufacture of a "track grinding machine," solving the long-standing problem of manual scraping of machine tool beds, and was warmly praised by the revolutionary masses.

Since the workers took over the leadership of the technical research department, the Huiyang Machinery Factory has achieved great success. The technical research department, which was once full of intellectuals, has solved the long-standing problems that could not be solved for a long time. The experience of the Huiyang Machinery Factory fully proves that the working class must lead everything, and the working class can lead everything.

	Benxi Steel Company's mechanical and electrical factory revolutionary workers, during the trial production of electric furnace hydraulic automatic device and smelting advanced steel varieties, broke through the "experts" and "authorities" of the Chinese Khrushchev to manage the factory and the thought of "technology first," and formed a three-in-one combination of revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel to carry out scientific experiments. This is the three-in-one combination of the casting workshop studying technological innovation with the stationed soldiers.

    工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够领导一切
    惠阳机械厂工人掌握技术领导大权创造优异成绩
    解放后只读了三年夜校的二级工萧作齐，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚和全心全意为人民服务的一颗红心，主持设计成功“单臂式立式”机床和“道轨磨床”，大大提高了工作效率，受到广大革命群众的热烈赞扬
    本报讯　最近，广东惠阳县机械厂革命职工学习了毛主席关于发挥工人阶级领导作用的一系列最新指示和姚文元同志《工人阶级必须领导一切》的重要文章后，全厂开了总结大会，总结几年来本厂工人冲破重重阻挠，夺了技术研究室的领导权后，大胆进行技术革命所取得的优异成绩。惠阳县机械厂的经验证明，工人阶级既能领导政治大革命，又能领导技术大革命。
    惠阳机械厂是个制造农业机械的工厂。随着农村社会主义建设的飞跃发展，工厂生产的产品远远不能满足广大贫下中农的需要。为了满足农村社会主义建设的需要，这个厂在广大贫下中农和厂里工人群众的迫切要求下，由厂里技术研究室的“技师”们开始设计制造一台机床。由于某些“技师”以“大学者”自居，长期脱离群众，迷信外国教科书，闭门造车，结果用了一年半时间造出一台“滚齿机床”，一投产就坏了，浪费了国家大量物资和资金。一九六四年，厂里工人们提出，机械厂技术研究室的领导权应该由工人来掌握。
    工人接管技术研究室以来，取得了很大成绩。例如，二级工萧作齐，在旧社会是一个讨饭十年的孤儿，是毛主席把他从火坑里救了出来。解放后他读了三年夜校。当他看见某些“技师”又神气，又不学无术，浪费国家大量资财时，气得直咬牙。工人接管技术研究室以后，萧作齐主动提出要设计制造一台能生产农业急需产品的“单臂式立式”机床。他这一建议得到全厂工人的拥护和支持。可是刚开始画设计图纸，就受到厂里某些“技师”的讽刺，说：“你是什么人？连大字都不认识几个，还想造大机器，想把技术研究室管起来！”萧作齐听了后，非常气愤地说：“我在旧社会是受苦人，现在是国家的主人，对革命有益的事，我们工人就是要管！”萧作齐怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚和全心全意为人民服务的一颗红心，大胆主持设计这台机床。他一次一次地学习毛主席“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”的教导，和工人同志们在一起，不怕某些“技师”的讥笑、打击，夜以继日地工作，弄不通的问题就找大伙商量，开座谈会，请教老工人。他每天晚上画图纸画到深夜两点。有一天，他爱人看见他瘦了，便说：“等你把机器画出来，你也没有命了。”萧作齐便和爱人一道学习毛主席“要奋斗就会有牺牲”的教导，一起忆苦思甜。他说：“只要我能为贫下中农服务，机器制造出来了，我死了也甘心。”萧作齐凭着对共产党、对伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，经过四个月的艰苦奋战，终于把整个机器的图纸画出来了。在全厂工人的支持下，仅用七个半月的时间，“单臂式立式”机床就试制成功，并投入了生产。效率比原机床提高六倍，质量也很好。在无产阶级文化大革命中，萧作齐又主持设计制造出一台“道轨磨床”，解决了长期以来用人工刮研床面的“老大难”问题，受到广大革命群众的热烈赞扬。
    惠阳机械厂由工人接管技术研究室的领导权以来，取得了很大成绩。过去知识分子成堆的技术研究室，长期不能解决的“老大难”问题也解决了。惠阳机械厂的经验，充分证明了工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够领导一切。　本报通讯员
