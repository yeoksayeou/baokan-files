	Sudanese masses held a demonstration and march in the capital, Khartoum, on September 8 to support the just struggle of the Palestinian people against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel.

	The demonstrators shouted slogans in the streets such as, “No freedom without guns,” “Long live the people’s war of the Palestinian people,” “The United Nations is a lackey of the United States,” “Down with political solutions,” and “Drive out American interests in Arab countries.”

	The marchers finally arrived at the residence of the delegation of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement’s commando unit, which is visiting here, met with the delegation, and expressed their support.

	One of the commandos of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement resolutely declared to the marchers, “We will never lay down our arms. We will fight to the end. We do not consider the United Nations Security Council and its resolutions, because we know that armed struggle is the correct path.”

	He said in discussing the brave battles of the Palestinian people against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, “In war, the decisive factor is people, not weapons.”

	Another Palestinian commando said, “We will fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and Israel, because they have occupied our homeland and made our people homeless.” He said, as Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out, U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries are paper tigers. We will thoroughly smash U.S. imperialism and the Israeli aggressors.

	The Iraqi News Agency and newspapers continued to publish commentaries and articles strongly condemning the recent military provocations by U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, against Arab countries, and calling on the Arab people to unite and defeat the aggressors.

	The commentary published by the Iraqi News Agency on September 10 pointed out that the recent attacks by the Israeli aggressors on the Suez Canal area “are part of the conspiracy of world imperialism, represented by the United States, and its tool of aggression in Tel Aviv.”

	The commentary pointed out that the repeated aggressions by world imperialism and Zionism against the Arab people have further strengthened the determination of the Arab people, who are eager for freedom and liberation, to fight against the aggressive forces headed by the United States.

	The Iraqi newspaper *Revolution* on September 11 said in an article that the recent aggressive actions by Israel against the Arab people have proven that so-called peaceful solutions to the Middle East problem are impossible.

	The article said, “The only force that can stop Israel is the Arab people who are ready to fight at any time.”

	The article said, the heroic actions of the Arab guerrilla fighters have proven that nothing frightens the rulers of Israel more than armed revolutionary violence.

	The article called for the expansion of armed resistance on the Arab lands occupied by Israel.

    苏丹群众示威声援巴勒斯坦人民的斗争
    巴勒斯坦突击队员说：我们决不放下武器，将同美帝以色列斗争到底
    新华社喀土穆十日电　苏丹首都喀土穆八日举行群众示威游行，声援巴勒斯坦人民为反对美帝国主义和以色列的侵略而进行的正义斗争。
    示威者在大街上高呼“没有枪杆子就没有自由”，“巴勒斯坦人民战争万岁”，“联合国是美国的走狗”，“打倒政治解决”，“清除美国在阿拉伯国家的利益”等口号。
    示威游行的人们最后来到正在这里访问的巴勒斯坦民族解放运动突击队代表团的住所，会见了这个代表团，并且向他们表示声援。
    一位巴勒斯坦民族解放运动突击队员对游行队伍坚决表示：“我们决不放下武器，我们将战斗到底。我们不考虑联合国安理会及其决议，因为我们知道武装斗争是正确的道路。”
    他在谈到巴勒斯坦人民同美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列进行的英勇战斗时说：“在战争中，决定性因素是人不是武器。”
    另一位巴勒斯坦突击队员说：“我们将同美帝国主义和以色列斗争到底，因为它们占领了我们的家园，使我们的人民无家可归。”他说，正如毛泽东主席所指出的，美帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎。我们将大力粉碎美帝国主义和以色列侵略者。
    新华社巴格达十一日电　伊拉克通讯社和报纸继续发表评论和文章，强烈谴责美帝国主义和它的侵略工具以色列最近对阿拉伯国家发动的新的军事挑衅，并号召阿拉伯人民团结一致，击败侵略者。
    伊拉克通讯社十日发表的评论指出，以色列侵略军最近对苏伊士运河地区的袭击“是以美国为代表的世界帝国主义和它在特拉维夫的侵略工具的阴谋的一部分”。
    评论指出，世界帝国主义和犹太复国主义对阿拉伯人民一再进行侵略，进一步增强了迫切要求自由解放的阿拉伯人民对以美国为首的侵略势力进行斗争的决心。
    伊拉克《革命报》十一日在一篇文章中指出，以色列最近对阿拉伯人民不断采取的侵略行动，已经证明所谓和平解决中东问题是不可能的。
    文章说：“制止以色列的唯一力量是我们阿拉伯人随时准备战斗。”
    文章说，英雄的阿拉伯游击队战士的行动证实：没有什么比武装的革命暴力更使以色列的统治者感到害怕。
    文章号召在被以色列霸占的阿拉伯土地上扩大武装抵抗。
