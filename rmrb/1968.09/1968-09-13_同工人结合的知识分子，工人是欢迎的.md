In the midst of the nationwide celebration of the red sun rising over China, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a new directive: "Students from old schools, the majority or a large majority, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they need to be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers under the correct leadership to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's new directive is our guiding light. We must study it earnestly and carry it out resolutely.

In January 1967, our factory was tasked with designing and manufacturing a major new product. The higher-ups required it to be completed in a short period. The factory revolutionary committee believed that, although this product was being designed and manufactured for the first time in our factory, as long as we firmly rely on the working class and fully utilize the technical personnel, the task of manufacturing the new product would definitely be completed. Therefore, it was decided that an old worker and a technical personnel who had a good relationship with workers would lead this work. They first organized the workers and technicians participating in the design and manufacturing to study Chairman Mao's teaching, "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," establishing the ambition to overcome technical difficulties. At the same time, they criticized the revisionist scientific research line of crawling, slavery, and abolitionism promoted by China's Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in our factory. With the strong support of the old workers, the technical personnel dared to innovate and proposed a direct assembly method for this product. This method could significantly shorten the time and save labor compared to the general method used abroad of pre-assembly followed by final assembly. However, adopting the direct assembly method, there was no guarantee that two important components would meet the precision requirements. At this time, a reactionary technical "authority" maliciously said, "Without pre-assembly, if you assemble it directly, it will definitely leak oil, water, and gas. When the test comes, I will wear a raincoat and hold an umbrella to watch." A group of young technicians who had just graduated from universities and secondary schools were very indignant upon hearing this. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching, "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experiment, humanity is always developing, and nature is always developing, never stopping at one level." They decided to give it a try. They took the direct assembly plan to the worker foremen, listening to the foremen's opinions. The foremen said to the young technicians, "You have such great aspirations, and we workers support you. Regarding the precision of the two important components, we guarantee to meet the design requirements." After the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA's support team learned of this situation, they immediately expressed their support. Thus, the old workers and technical personnel jointly decided to first process and manufacture the two important components.

The process of processing and manufacturing the two important components was also a process of old workers re-educating the technical personnel. The old workers continuously armed the technicians with Mao Zedong Thought. In their spare time, the foremen and technicians studied Chairman Mao's works together and carried out heart-to-heart talks. Some technicians had old ideas and did not fully understand the significance of labor. The foremen helped them criticize China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "disdaining labor" and "reading books to become officials," continuously changing the technicians' bourgeois ideas. In production, when a technician made a mistake with a part, causing rework and waste, the foreman did not blame him but enthusiastically helped him correct it. Some technicians, under the help of the old workers, were willing to accept the old workers' re-education. Those who originally looked down on manual labor now all went deep into the workshops to eat, live, and work with the workers, taking the old workers as their teachers. They operated the machines with the foremen, helped the foremen with tools, moved parts, and when there were problems in production and technology, they discussed and solved them on the spot. Through the joint efforts of the old workers and technical personnel, the precision of the two important components completely met the requirements.

Next, the workers and technicians jointly carried out the machine's final assembly. At the trial manufacturing site, workers and technicians together posted big-character posters, writing bold words: "Standing on the test bench, thinking of Chairman Mao, manufacturing the test machine, making the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries gasp." To express their loyalty to Chairman Mao, the foremen proposed to fight for three days and nights to complete the final assembly of this test machine. The comrades of the factory revolutionary committee and the technical personnel and foremen worked day and night, caring for and helping each other, finally completing the final assembly according to the plan. This test machine was successfully manufactured. This is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It fully proves that intellectuals can only play their role by uniting with workers. The foremen said with satisfaction, "Intellectuals who unite with workers, we workers welcome them."

    同工人结合的知识分子，工人是欢迎的
    国防工业毛泽东思想学习班六班学员　金永生
    在全国亿万军民热烈欢庆全国山河一片红的大喜日子里，伟大领袖毛主席又向我们发出了最新指示：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的最新指示，是我们的指路明灯，我们要认真学习，坚决执行。
    一九六七年一月，我厂承担了一项重大新产品的设计和试制任务。上级要求在短期内试制成功。厂革委会认为，虽然这项产品在我厂是第一次设计和制造，但是，只要紧紧依靠工人阶级，充分发挥技术人员的作用，新产品试制任务一定能够完成。于是，决定由一位老工人和一位同工人结合较好的技术人员领导这项工作。他们首先组织参加设计和试制的工人、技术员一起学习毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，树立了攻克技术难关的雄心壮志。同时，他们还批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和本厂走资派推行的爬行主义、奴隶主义、取消主义的修正主义科研路线。技术人员在老工人的大力支持下，敢于革新，提出该项产品直接总装的装配方法。这样，比国外一般采用的先预装，然后再总装的装配方法，可以大大缩短时间，节省劳动力。但是，采取直接总装的装配方法，有两个重要部件在加工精密度上能否达到要求，很没有把握。这时一个反动技术“权威”阴险地说：“不经过预装，一下子总装出来，一定会漏油，漏水，漏气。等到试验的时候，我穿着雨衣、撑着雨伞来看。”一批刚从大学、中等学校毕业出来的年青技术员，听了十分气愤。他们遵照毛主席“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上”的伟大教导，决心闯一闯。他们把直接总装的方案拿到工人老师傅中去，听取老师傅的意见。老师傅对年青技术员说：“你们有这样的雄心壮志，我们工人支持你们。关于两个重要部件的加工精密度，我们保证达到设计要求。”厂革委会和解放军驻厂支左人员知道这个情况后，也立即表示支持。于是，老工人和技术人员共同商量决定，先加工制造两个重要部件。
    加工制造两个重要部件的过程，也是老工人给技术人员以再教育的过程。老工人不断地用毛泽东思想去武装技术员，在业余时间，老师傅和技术员一起学习毛主席著作，开展谈心活动。有些技术员存在着旧思想，对劳动的意义认识不足，老师傅就和他们一起开展革命的大批判，帮助技术员认识中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“轻视劳动”、“读书做官”谬论对青年的毒害，不断地改变技术员的资产阶级思想。在生产中，当一个技术员将一个零件搞错，造成返工浪费时，老师傅并没有责备他，而是热情地帮助改正过来。有些技术员在老工人帮助下，愿意接受老工人的再教育。原来轻视体力劳动的技术员，现在都深入车间和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，拜老工人为师。他们和老师傅一起操作，帮助老师傅拿工具，搬零件，在生产技术上发生问题时，当场研究，当场解决。经过老工人和技术人员共同努力，两个重要部件的加工精密度完全达到要求。
    紧接着，工人和技术人员一起进行机器的总装工作。在试制现场，工人和技术员共同贴出了大字标语，写上了豪言壮语：“身在试车台，心向毛主席，造出试验机，气死帝修反”。为了向毛主席他老人家献忠心，老师傅们提出奋战三昼夜，完成这台试验机的总装任务。厂革委会的同志和技术人员、老师傅一起，日夜奋战，互相关心，互相帮助，终于按照计划完成总装任务，这台试验机终于试制成功了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。这充分证明了知识分子只有同工人相结合才能发挥自己的作用。老师傅们满意地说：“同工人结合的知识分子，我们工人就是欢迎。”
