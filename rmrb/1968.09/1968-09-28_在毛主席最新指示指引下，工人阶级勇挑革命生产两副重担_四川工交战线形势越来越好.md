Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class in Sichuan Province bravely shoulders the dual burdens of revolution and production. While dispatching a large number of workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to lead schools and other superstructure units in the struggle, criticism, and reform, they have also achieved remarkable results in production. The production and cargo volume of many key products on the industrial and transportation fronts have been increasing month by month.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on the 27th, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class in Sichuan Province bravely shoulders the dual burdens of revolution and production. They have dispatched a large number of workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to lead schools and other superstructure units in the struggle, criticism, and reform, while also achieving remarkable results in production. Since the third quarter, the production and cargo volume of many key products on the industrial and transportation fronts have been increasing month by month.

The working class in Sichuan Province closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, exposing the crimes of a handful of class enemies who split the ranks of the working class, incite people to fight against each other, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. They have severely criticized the revisionist goods such as "material incentives" and "technology first" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial front. Broad masses of revolutionary workers, especially through the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions such as "the working class is the leading class," have greatly raised their political consciousness, promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and revolutionary committees have been established in various factories and mines.

The great leader Chairman Mao's two receptions of coal mine workers' representatives have greatly inspired the broad masses of coal mine workers. With boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have taken the lead, achieving remarkable results in the significant increase of coal production. The rapid increase in coal production has created favorable conditions for the increased production of other industrial products. Textile industry workers, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp the production of cloth tightly," have also achieved new successes in production. Since September, the production levels of cotton yarn and cotton cloth have significantly improved.

The transportation front across the province is bustling with activity. Cargo volume has significantly increased. The railway department, on the basis of the continuous increase in cargo volume in July and August, has further increased the average cargo volume in mid-September by 21% compared to the original plan. Transport workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have also organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda car teams, ship teams, and red mail car propaganda teams. While transporting production and construction materials and urban and rural people's living necessities, they actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought. A red mail car team composed of workers from Chengdu and PLA combatants has traveled along the roads where the Red Army once passed, covering 13 counties, delivering more than ten million copies of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and other documents, as well as more than seven million copies of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" to the revolutionary people in remote mountainous areas.

    在毛主席最新指示指引下，工人阶级勇挑革命生产两副重担
    四川工交战线形势越来越好
    抽调大批工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队领导学校和其他上层建筑单位斗批改的同时，生产又取得显著成绩，主要产品产量和货运量逐月增长
    据新华社成都二十七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，四川省工人阶级勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，他们在抽调大批工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队，领导学校和其他上层建筑单位的斗、批、改的同时，又在生产上取得了显著成绩。三季度以来，工业交通战线上不少主要产品的产量和货运量都一月比一月增长。
    四川省工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，揭露了一小撮阶级敌人分裂工人阶级队伍，挑动群众斗群众，破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的罪行；狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在工业战线上推行的“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等修正主义黑货。广大革命工人特别通过对毛主席的“工人阶级是领导阶级”等最新指示的学习，大大提高了政治觉悟，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，各厂矿的革命委员会纷纷成立。
    伟大领袖毛主席两次接见煤矿工人代表的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了广大煤矿工人，他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚的心情，一马当先，取得了煤炭产量大幅度上升的优异成绩。煤炭产量的迅速上升，为其他工业产品的增产创造了良好的条件。纺织工业的职工，遵照毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的教导，在生产上也取得了新的成就，九月份以来，棉纱、棉布的生产水平都有很大提高。
    全省交通运输战线上，到处呈现着一片热气腾腾的繁忙景象。货运量大幅度上升。铁路部门在七、八月份货运量不断上升的基础上，九月中旬的平均货运量又比原计划提高了百分之二十一。用毛泽东思想武装起来的运输工人，还组织了毛泽东思想宣传车队、船队、红色邮车宣传队，在运送生产建设物资和城乡人民生活用品的同时，积极宣传毛泽东思想。由成都工人和人民解放军指战员组成的一支红色邮车队，沿着当年红军走过的道路前进，走了十三个县，将十多万份毛主席的最新指示等文件以及七万多张革命油画《毛主席去安源》送到了边远山区的革命人民手中。
