	East Tokyo — Shortly after returning to Japan from a visit to China, Long Tenryu, a standing member of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, spoke at a welcoming ceremony held at Haneda Airport and at a press conference held in Tokyo on August 24. He expressed his profound feelings of boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, and enthusiastically hailed the great victories achieved by China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Long Tenryu joyfully recalled the thrilling scene of being received by Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the whole world, during the National Day celebrations of the People's Republic of China last year in Beijing. He said, "Chairman Mao is in extremely good health. Chairman Mao is loved and trusted without limit by the 700 million Chinese people." Long Tenryu sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

	Long Tenryu enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that he deeply understood that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution carried out under socialist conditions, a highly acute and complex class struggle. This great revolution smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Long Tenryu emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has extremely profound significance.

	Long Tenryu enthusiastically praised the Chinese people for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's great thoughts. He said that whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the revolutionary masses in China are all inspired and express their heartfelt support, and strive to study and resolutely carry out these instructions. He said that he would in the future better study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, and strive to propagate Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts.

	Long Tenryu enthusiastically hailed the birth of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," a beautiful flower of revolutionary arts in China, under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of "learning from foreign things to serve China." Long Tenryu pointed out that the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," along with the other eight model operas, was born in the midst of the fierce class struggle during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are truly new arts that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Long Tenryu excitedly said that the piano, which has long been hailed by the bourgeoisie as the "king of music," is today in China becoming an instrument serving the laboring people.

	In discussing the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, Long Tenryu pointed out that in order for Japan to achieve independence and prosperity, it is necessary to enhance the friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and China. This is indispensable for the present and future of the Japanese people.

	This famous Japanese cultural figure, who has persistently sought the truth and bravely opposed the reactionary actions of the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party, expressed in his speech his resolute opposition to the reactionary actions of the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party.

    文化大革命进一步巩固了无产阶级专政
    盛赞中国样板戏和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》是真正为工农兵服务的新文艺
    新华社讯　东京消息：访问中国后不久前回到日本的日中文化交流协会常任理事河原崎长十郎在羽田机场的欢迎会上以及八月二十四日在东京举行的记者招待会上发表谈话，表达了他对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的深厚感情，并且热情欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。
    河原崎幸福地回忆了他在去年中华人民共和国国庆节期间，在北京光荣地受到全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席接见时的激动人心的情景。他说，毛主席身体非常非常健康。毛主席受到七亿中国人民的无限热爱和无限信仰。河原崎衷心祝福毛主席万寿无疆！
    河原崎热情赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌胜利。他说，他深刻地认识到中国无产阶级文化大革命是在社会主义条件下进行的一场大革命，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。这一场大革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫企图在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。河原崎强调指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命具有极为深远的意义。
    河原崎热情赞扬中国人民活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想。他说，每当毛主席的最新指示发表时，中国革命群众无不欢欣鼓舞，表示衷心拥护，并努力学习和坚决贯彻执行。他说，他今后要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，并且努力宣传毛泽东思想。
    河原崎热烈欢呼在毛主席“洋为中用”的伟大思想指引下开放出来的中国革命文艺的又一朵美丽的鲜花——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生。河原崎强调指出，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，与其他八个样板戏一样，是在中国无产阶级文化大革命中，在激烈的阶级斗争风暴中诞生的，它们是真正地为工农兵服务的新文艺。河原崎兴奋地说，一向被资产阶级捧为“音乐之王”的钢琴，今天在中国正变成为劳动人民服务的乐器了。
    河原崎在谈到日中两国人民的友谊时指出，为了日本的独立与繁荣，必须增进日中两国人民的友好关系。这对日本人民的今天和未来，都是不可缺少的。
    这一位坚持真理、勇敢地造了日共宫本修正主义集团的反的日本著名文化界人士，在谈话中表示坚决反对日共宫本修正主义集团的倒行逆施。
