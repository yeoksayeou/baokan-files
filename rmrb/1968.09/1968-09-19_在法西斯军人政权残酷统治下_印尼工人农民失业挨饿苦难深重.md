Under the brutal rule of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, the living conditions of the broad masses of laboring people in Indonesia are being increasingly severely impacted, with unemployment and famine making their lives miserable.

The number of unemployed nationwide reaches 8.7 million

According to Western news agencies, by the end of August this year, the number of unemployed in Indonesia has reached 8.7 million.

Currently, due to the influx of foreign goods into the Indonesian market, this has further increased the number of unemployed. It is reported that currently, 80% of textile factories in Indonesia have closed down, and 500,000 textile workers are unemployed. The Antara News Agency admits, "The current trend is that the number of unemployed will continue to increase."

This news agency also revealed that the Indonesian fascist military regime will further target workers, stating, "In both government and private economic activities, there is a trend of large-scale layoffs of workers."

The spread of edema in rural areas

Under the brutal exploitation of the Indonesian fascist military regime, more than 80% of Indonesia's population, who are peasants, are living an even more miserable life. Rural famines are becoming increasingly severe, and edema caused by hunger is spreading everywhere. Java, Sumatra, and other grain-producing areas have become food-deficient areas. The impoverished peasants are filling their stomachs with tree leaves, banana stems, wild fruits, and even rotten wood. According to a reactionary newspaper in Jakarta, in one county in South Sumatra, a large number of peasants have contracted edema, "The patients' bodies are only skin and bones, with swollen stomachs. Their various organs can no longer move, and they can only be identified as alive by their eyes." In West Sumatra, many peasants are forced to sell their children, and some bring their families to leave their hometowns and escape the famine. In Java, large numbers of peasants who have been stripped of their land are flocking to Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, and Surabaya to seek a way out. Due to the influx of people who have lost their livelihoods, Western news agencies refer to Jakarta as the "capital of the world's vagabonds."

    在法西斯军人政权残酷统治下
    印尼工人农民失业挨饿苦难深重
    在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权残酷统治下的印度尼西亚，广大劳动人民的生活受到越来越严重的打击，失业和饥荒使他们困苦不堪。
    全国失业人数达八百七十万
    据西方通讯社透露，到今年八月底为止，印尼全国失业人数达八百七十万。
    目前，由于外国商品充斥印尼市场，这就进一步使失业人数增加。据报道，目前印尼有百分之八十的纺织厂倒闭，五十万纺织工人失业。安塔拉通讯社承认，“现在的趋势是，失业人数将不断增加”。
    这家通讯社还透露，印尼法西斯军人政权还要进一步向工人开刀，它说，“在政府或私营的经济活动方面，都有大批解雇工人的倾向”。
    农村水肿病蔓延
    在印尼法西斯军人政权的残酷压榨下，占印尼全国人口百分之八十以上的印度尼西亚农民，过着更加悲惨的生活。农村饥荒越来越严重，因饥饿而得的水肿病到处蔓延。爪哇、苏门答腊等产粮区，成了缺粮区，广大贫苦农民以树叶、香蕉茎、野果甚至腐烂的木头充饥。据雅加达反动报纸透露，南苏门答腊一个县有大批农民患了水肿病，“患者的躯体只剩皮包骨，肚子膨胀。他们身体各器官再也无法动弹，只能从眼睛判明，他们还活着。”在西苏门答腊，许多农民被迫卖儿卖女，有的携男带女离乡背井，出外逃荒。爪哇岛大批被夺去了土地的农民，纷纷流入雅加达、万隆、三宝垄和泗水等城市寻找生路。由于失去生计的人口大量涌入，西方通讯社称雅加达为“世界上‘游民的首都’”。
