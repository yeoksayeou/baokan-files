One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions, personally visiting Hunan, and gave us a series of most brilliant instructions, pointing the way for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have enabled us to distinguish the direction in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and to advance courageously.

Now, under the leadership of the working class, the people of the entire country are fighting to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. At this crucial moment, our great leader Chairman Mao has again issued the great instruction that intellectuals must receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Students from old-style schools, the majority or a large majority, can unite with workers and peasants, and some have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the leadership of the correct line and receive re-education from workers and peasants to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings have pointed the way forward for our unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers. We, the Red Guards, wholeheartedly support and will certainly carry out Chairman Mao's great call. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, follow the path of unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and sincerely accept the leadership of the working class and humbly receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the only correct path for us, the Red Guards, and all revolutionary intellectuals.

Reflecting on the path I have taken during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction that intellectuals must receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the early and middle stages of the movement, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and fought bravely against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, achieving great victories. However, due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line in the past, we were long detached from the workers and peasants and from reality, and suffered from the problem of a gap between theory and practice. Later, for a period, we did not follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely. Afterward, with the help and education of worker comrades and PLA comrades, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually does unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Only then did I wake up and begin to realize that only by putting down the airs of an intellectual, getting rid of the problem of a gap between theory and practice, consciously accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly transforming our worldview, and unconditionally uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, is the only correct path for young intellectuals. From then on, I actively contacted worker comrades, humbly sought their guidance, and accepted their education. Under the leadership of the working class, my class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness has been continuously enhanced. Therefore, at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I firmly stood with the working class, thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary plot of the class enemy to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee, and made the revolutionary committee increasingly solid.

In July of this year, I and several other comrades went to the countryside to investigate the situation of the Cultural Revolution. This investigation process was also a process of receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers for me. I saw with my own eyes the noble qualities of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. They have limitless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the Cultural Revolution, they consciously studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, critically denounced the counter-revolutionary revisionist trash of the Chinese Khrushchev such as "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," deeply carried out the struggle against the enemy, insisted on the socialist road, defended the socialist collective economy, and fought resolutely against bad people and bad deeds, following the Dazhai road, achieving one good harvest after another in agricultural production, and creating many moving deeds, which gave me a living education. I deeply felt that if intellectuals do not unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and detach from the leadership of the working class, they will achieve nothing in the revolutionary journey and may even go astray. In the future, I will definitely strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely obey the leadership of the working class, humbly learn from the working class, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from the PLA, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, follow the path of unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly transform my thoughts, and be like workers, peasants, and soldiers, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and be a reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    响应毛主席号召坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路
    湖南省革命委员会常委、中南矿冶学院学生　陈勇
    一年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席视察了华北、中南、华东三大区，亲临湖南，对我们作了一系列最英明的指示，为我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利指明了方向。毛主席的一系列最新指示，使我们能够在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，明辨方向，奋勇前进。
    现在，全国人民正在工人阶级领导下，为完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务而斗争。我们的伟大领袖毛主席在这样一个关键时刻，又向我们发出了知识分子要接受工农兵再教育的伟大指示。毛主席教导我们说：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的亲切教导，为我们与工农兵相结合指明了前进的道路。我们红卫兵小将一千个拥护，一万个照办。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，走同工农兵相结合的道路，老老实实地接受工人阶级的领导，虚心接受工农兵的再教育。这是我们红卫兵小将和一切要革命的知识分子的唯一正确的道路。
    回顾自己在无产阶级文化大革命中所走过的道路，我深深体会到毛主席关于由工农兵给知识分子以再教育的指示的英明和正确。在运动的初期和中期，我们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向党内一小撮走资派进行了英勇的搏斗，取得了伟大的胜利。但是，由于过去受了修正主义教育路线的毒害，长期脱离工农群众，长期脱离实际，存在着理论与实际脱节的毛病，后来有一个时期，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得不紧。以后，在工人同志和解放军同志的帮助和教育下，我反复学习了毛主席关于“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的教导，才猛醒过来，开始认识到只有放下知识分子的架子，去掉理论与实际脱节的毛病，自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造世界观，长期地无条件地同工农兵相结合，才是青年知识分子唯一正确的道路。从此以后，我就主动地同工人同志联系，虚心向他们求教，接受他们的教育。在工人阶级的领导下，我的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，因此，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我坚定地和工人阶级站在一起，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会的反革命阴谋，使革命委员会越来越巩固。
    今年七月份，我和其他几个同志到农村去调查文化大革命的情况，这次调查的过程，对我来说，也是接受工农兵再教育的过程。我亲眼看到了广大贫下中农的高贵品质。他们对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限热爱，无限忠诚。在文化大革命中，他们自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货痛加批判，深入开展对敌斗争，坚持走社会主义道路，维护社会主义集体经济，与坏人坏事作坚决斗争，走大寨的道路，夺取了农业生产一个又一个好收成，创造了许多动人的事迹，使我受到了一次活生生的教育。我深深体会到，知识分子如果不和工农兵结合，脱离工人阶级的领导，在革命的征途中就将一事无成，甚至要走向反面。今后，我一定努力活学活用毛泽东思想，遵照毛主席的教导，坚决服从工人阶级的领导，虚心向工人阶级学习，向贫下中农学习，向解放军学习，接受工农兵的再教育，走与工农兵相结合的道路，彻底改造自己的思想，象工农兵那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
