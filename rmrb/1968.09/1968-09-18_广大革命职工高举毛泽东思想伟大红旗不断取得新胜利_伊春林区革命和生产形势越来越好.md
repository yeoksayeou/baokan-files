Broad revolutionary workers in Yichun Forest Area continue to achieve new victories under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary and production situation in the area is getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 17th: The largest timber production base in our country, the Yichun Forest Area in Heilongjiang Province, under the strong assistance of the PLA support-left troops, has been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the great struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production, they have continuously achieved new victories.

Since this year, the timber production in this forest area has been increasing month by month, maintaining stable and high production. The average daily production in the second quarter increased by 10.06% compared to the first quarter, and the average daily production in July and August of the third quarter increased by 7.8% compared to the second quarter. Large quantities of timber are being transported from here to various parts of the country, providing strong support for the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the state.

The Yichun Forest Area is extremely rich in timber resources and is known as the "hometown of red pine." For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the forest area have been peddling the reactionary revisionist goods of "class struggle extinction theory," "money as the commander," and "material incentives." They attempted to carry out capitalist restoration in the forest area. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution drove the handful of capitalist roaders in the party down from their positions. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness," and under the leadership of various levels of revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary forestry workers have been vigorously seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production, making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire forest area better and better.

In the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, the broad revolutionary workers in the Yichun Forest Area use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. The revolutionary workers fighting in the vast forest have sharply criticized and exposed the reactionary fallacies and heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the forest area, who advocated "money as the commander," "material incentives," and spread the reactionary economic wind. This has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The broad forestry workers have displayed the high sense of responsibility and fearless heroism of the working class, overcoming one difficulty after another in completing production tasks. This year, after the winter production peak season turned into the summer production off-season, the ice and snow melted, and the rain continued, making the transportation lines muddy and affecting production. The broad revolutionary workers have displayed the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting, seizing every opportunity to fill in the transportation lines and repair machinery, creating good conditions for production. Thus, they have overfulfilled the production tasks, turning the off-season into a peak season. The revolutionary workers of the Da Feng Forestry Bureau, after overfulfilling the production tasks of the first half of the year, the state gave them an additional production task of ten thousand cubic meters. The broad revolutionary workers bravely took on the heavy burden, with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and tried their best in the areas where it is difficult to log and transport, making full use of every cubic meter of timber resources for the state.

After severely criticizing the revisionist goods of "experts managing factories," the broad revolutionary workers in the forest area, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," have displayed the spirit of self-reliance and daring to think and act, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. Some miracles that were not even dared to be thought of in the past have now been created. The revolutionary workers of the Youhao Comprehensive Wood Processing Plant have implemented thirteen major technological innovations this year, some of which have caught up with or surpassed the international advanced level.

In the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, the revolutionary committees and workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams at various levels in the forest area have gone deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, enthusiastically propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and together with the broad revolutionary workers, vigorously seizing class struggle and carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, strongly promoting the great development of production.

    广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗不断取得新胜利
    伊春林区革命和生产形势越来越好
    据新华社哈尔滨十七日电  我国最大的木材生产基地——黑龙江省伊春林区的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中，不断取得新的胜利。
    今年以来，这个林区木材生产逐月上升，始终稳产高产。第二季度平均日产量比第一季度增长了百分之十点零六，第三季度七、八两月平均日产量又比第二季度增长百分之七点八。大批的木材正源源从这里运往全国各地，有力地支援了国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    伊春林区木材资源极其丰富，有“红松故乡”之称。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在林区的代理人，大肆兜售“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图在林区进行资本主义复辟。无产阶级文化大革命把党内一小撮走资派赶下了台。广大革命林业工人，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”伟大方针的指引下，在各级革委会领导下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使整个林区革命、生产形势越来越好。
    伊春林区广大革命职工在抓革命、促生产的斗争中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判。战斗在浩瀚林海的广大革命职工，对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在林区代理人鼓吹的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反动谬论和大刮反革命经济主义妖风的滔天罪行狠揭猛批，极大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大林业工人，发扬工人阶级的主人翁的高度责任感和大无畏的英雄气概，在完成生产任务中，克服了一个又一个困难。今年，冬季生产旺季转为夏季生产淡季后，冰雪融化，阴雨连绵，运输线路泥泞，生产受到很大影响。广大革命职工发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，抓紧一切时间填补运输线路，抢修机械，为生产创造了良好的条件，从而超额完成生产任务，变生产淡季为旺季。大丰林业局革命工人，在超额完成上半年生产任务以后，国家又给他们增加一万立方米生产任务。广大革命职工勇敢地挑起重担，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，尽量在山陡难采伐、运输不便利的地区采伐，让国家每一立方米的木材资源都得到充分利用。
    林区广大革命职工在狠批“专家治厂”等修正主义黑货以后，遵照毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的伟大教导，发扬自力更生和敢想敢干的革命精神，大搞技术革新和技术革命。一些过去连想都不敢想的奇迹现在创造出来了。友好木材综合加工厂的革命职工，今年以来实现了十三项重大技术革新，有些赶上或超过了国际先进水平。
    在抓革命、促生产中，林区各级革命委员会和工人毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到阶级斗争、生产斗争第一线，热情宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，和广大革命职工一起狠抓阶级斗争、开展革命大批判，有力地促进了生产大发展。
