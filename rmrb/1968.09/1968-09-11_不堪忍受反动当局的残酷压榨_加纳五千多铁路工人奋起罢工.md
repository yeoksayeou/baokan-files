Unable to endure the brutal exploitation of the reactionary regime, over 5,000 railway workers in Ghana have risen up in strike.

	The workers' struggle has lasted for a week, frightening the Ghanaian military junta.
	The struggle against racial discrimination by South African students continues to expand.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 10: A message from Accra: Unable to endure the brutal exploitation of the Ghanaian military junta, Ghanaian railway workers launched a large-scale strike starting on the 2nd. Over 5,700 railway workers participating in the strike have been demanding wage increases and improved working conditions, and the strike has lasted for a week.

	The strike by Ghanaian railway workers has frightened the Ghanaian military junta. On the 7th, Ghana's police chief, John Haley, declared that the strike was "illegal" and that it hid a "vast conspiracy" to overthrow the government. Following Haley's speech, the Ghanaian authorities began to suppress the striking workers. By the 9th, over 60 railway workers had been arrested, and the authorities threatened and forced workers to return to work by dismissing them.

	Since the Ghanaian military junta came to power in February 1966, they have aligned with American and British imperialism abroad and brutally exploited the laboring people at home, causing production to stagnate, unemployment to surge, foreign debt to increase, prices to skyrocket, and the people to suffer greatly. The broad masses of Ghanaian laboring people are increasingly dissatisfied with the current situation. Over the past two years, Ghanaian workers, despite the suppression by the military and police, have frequently launched strikes and other struggles.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 10: A message from Ellis: The wave of demonstrations by South African students against the apartheid policies of the South African government has recently spread from the University of Cape Town and the University of the Witwatersrand to the University of Fort Hare in the Cape Province. About 200 African students at the University of Fort Hare have been persistently sitting in and demonstrating to protest against the apartheid policies of the South African government. On the 6th, the South African apartheid authorities ruthlessly expelled these demonstrating students and sent police to suppress them. When the police with dogs rushed into the University of Fort Hare, the students sitting in and demonstrating there sang the song "We Shall Overcome" and bravely fought against the police.

	The strike and sit-in demonstration by African students at the University of Fort Hare has lasted for nine days.

    不堪忍受反动当局的残酷压榨
    加纳五千多铁路工人奋起罢工
    工人的斗争已坚持一周，吓坏了加纳军事政变当局
    南非大学生反对种族歧视斗争不断扩大
    新华社十日讯　阿克拉消息：不堪忍受加纳军事政变当局残酷压榨的加纳铁路工人，从二日起爆发了大规模的罢工斗争。参加罢工的五千七百多名铁路工人坚持要求增加工资和改善工作条件，罢工已持续了一周之久。
    加纳铁路工人的罢工吓坏了加纳军事政变当局。加纳警察头子约翰·哈利七日说罢工是
  “非法的”，它的背后隐藏着一个企图推翻政府的“庞大的阴谋”。在哈利的讲话后，加纳当局开始大肆镇压罢工工人。到九日止，已有六十多名铁路工人被逮捕，当局并以解雇来威胁和强迫工人复工。
    加纳军事政变当局自一九六六年二月上台以来，对外投靠美英帝国主义，对内残酷压榨劳动人民，以致造成生产停滞，失业剧增，外债增加，物价飞涨，民不聊生。处于水深火热之中的广大加纳劳动人民越来越不满现状。两年多来，加纳工人不顾军警的镇压，经常爆发罢工等斗争。
    新华社十日讯　艾利斯消息：南非大学生反对南非当局种族歧视政策的示威斗争浪潮，最近已从开普敦大学和韦特瓦特斯兰德大学扩大到开普省艾利斯的黑尔堡大学。黑尔堡大学大约二百名非洲学生坚持静坐示威，抗议南非当局种族歧视政策。六日，南非种族主义当局悍然宣布开除这些示威学生，并且出动警察前往镇压。当带着警犬的警察冲进黑尔堡大学时，那里静坐示威的学生高唱《我们将得胜》的歌曲，同警察展开英勇斗争。
    黑尔堡大学非洲学生的罢课和静坐示威斗争已经坚持了九天。
