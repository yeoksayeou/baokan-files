Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also constantly raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

From the standpoint of the landlord and bourgeoisie, the Chinese Khrushchev says: "Don't think that relying on the working class is problem-free." He says we must "especially rely on the factory directors, engineers, and technicians."

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan colluded to fiercely resist and sabotage the "Anshan Constitution." They frantically promoted their revisionist black program for running enterprises, attempting to turn Anshan Steel into their "independent kingdom" for restoring capitalism.

The capitalist roaders in our mine, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, established an "Engineering Office" in our mine, which they called the "Command Center." They called those so-called "experts" and technical "authorities" "commanders," with one of them as the chief engineer, self-proclaimed as the "commander-in-chief." They monopolized the production and technical powers of our mine.

Those few people in the "Command Center" were completely detached from the worker masses. Once, they had a sudden inspiration and wanted to "mobilize the masses" to install an automatic control "safety card" on a hoisting machine. Thus, they announced this technological innovation plan, calling on everyone to compete for the "topic," and stipulated that whoever could realize this innovation would be awarded a bonus of 5,000 yuan. The capitalist roaders in our mine even said: "With great rewards, there will be brave men." But when we workers saw this, we were so angry that our eyes were on fire. This is not about "technological innovation"! This is not about "mobilizing the masses"! This is clearly inciting us workers to compete for fame and profit, trying to drag us down the capitalist road to death! Therefore, we all resolutely resisted. As a result, this "topic" was taken by someone in the "Command Center." This person spent day and night poring over books, consulting foreign doctrines, and expended tremendous effort for over half a year, but still couldn't make any progress.

We workers do not believe in their tricks. We believe in the infallible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. 'Without correct political views, it is as if there is no soul.' It is Mao Zedong Thought that has enlightened our hearts. We do not rely on heaven, nor on earth, but on the great Mao Zedong Thought, and on emphasizing proletarian politics. Through everyone's discussion, we found many measures to prevent accidents on the hoisting machine, ensuring its safe operation, and it has never had an accident.

This "Command Center" also set up an "experimental mining area," assigning more than 60 workers to conduct experiments for them. They drew up "blueprints" according to the books and had us workers carry out the experiments as if we were "living tools." Once they achieved some results, they would write them in their accounts to gain political capital.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers and the broad revolutionary masses have thoroughly exposed and criticized the handful of capitalist roaders led by the Chinese Khrushchev, overthrown them, and seized their power, establishing the revolutionary committee. We criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of not believing in workers, not relying on workers, and relying only on a few "experts" and technical "authorities" to run enterprises in a cold and lonely manner. We held high the great banner of the "Anshan Constitution," believing in and relying on workers and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel, launching mass movements, and fully playing the leading role of the working class in the three great revolutionary movements. We solved many major production and technical problems. The tailings dam construction problem and the excessive bearing damage problem, which had not been solved for a long time by the "Command Center," were solved because we workers class studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, launched mass movements, and everyone contributed ideas and efforts. As a result, the dam construction project exceeded the international advanced level, and bearing damage was reduced from more than 30 pairs per month to one pair. This demonstrates the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the great power of relying on the working class and launching mass movements. This is also a resounding slap in the face of the Chinese Khrushchev!

    “专家治厂”就是资产阶级治厂
    鞍钢弓长岭铁矿工人　崔凤善
    毛主席教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫从地主资产阶级立场出发，胡说什么：“不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的。”要“特别依靠厂长，工程师和技师”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人，串通一气，疯狂地抵制和破坏“鞍钢宪法”，拚命地推行他们炮制的修正主义办企业的黑纲领，妄图把鞍钢作为他们复辟资本主义的“独立王国”。
    我们矿里的走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人的旨意，在我们矿成立了一个“工程师室”，自封为“帅府”，把那些所谓“专家”、技术“权威”叫做“帅”，他则任总工程师，自封为“总帅”。他们独揽了我们矿的生产和技术大权。
    “帅府”里的那几个人，完全脱离了工人群众。有一次，他们心血来潮，忽然想到要“发动群众”，在一台卷扬机上搞一个自动控制的“安全卡”。于是，就把这项技术革新计划公布出来，号召大家来抢“课题”，并规定谁能实现这项革新，就发给奖金五千元。我们矿里的走资派，竟胡说什么：“重赏之下，必有勇夫。”可是我们工人一看就气得两眼冒火，这哪里是搞“技术革新”？这是哪家的“发动群众”？这不明明是在煽动我们工人去抢名利，要把我们拉到资本主义的死路上去吗！所以我们都坚决抵制。结果，这项“课题”被“帅府”中的人抢去了。这个人白天黑夜地翻书本，请教洋教条，花了半年多时间，费了九牛二虎之力，也没搞出个名堂来。
    我们工人不相信他们那一套，我们就相信战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”是毛泽东思想把我们的心照亮了。我们不靠天，不靠地，就靠伟大的毛泽东思想，就靠突出无产阶级政治。经过大家讨论，找出了许多防止卷扬机出事故的措施，保证了这台卷扬机的安全运转，一直没出过一次事故。
    这个“帅府”还搞一个“试验采区”，抽调六十多名工人，专门为他们搞试验。他们照书本搞出“蓝图”，叫我们工人照样进行试验，把我们工人当“活工具”，一旦搞出一点成绩就写在他们的账上，好让他们捞取政治资本。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人阶级和广大革命群众，大造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资派的反，把他们打翻在地，夺了他们的权，建立了革命委员会。我们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫不相信工人，不依靠工人，只靠少数“专家”、技术“权威”冷冷清清办企业的修正主义路线。我们高举“鞍钢宪法”的伟大旗帜，相信和依靠工人和革命的工程技术人员，大搞群众运动，在三大革命运动中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，解决了许多生产和技术上的重大问题。原来靠“帅府”长时期没有解决的尾矿坝筑坝问题和轴承损坏太大的问题，由于我们工人阶级活学活用毛主席著作，大搞群众运动，人人献计献策，个个动脑动手，结果使筑坝工程超过了国际最先进的水平，轴承损坏从过去的每月三十多对，减少到一对。这显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，显示了依靠工人阶级，大搞群众运动的巨大威力。这也是给中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光！
