The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tongshan Town, under the leadership of the People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, has been implementing the policy of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. After the reduction, the number of personnel decreased by 37%, and the revolutionary masses were very pleased with this measure. Under the suggestion of the propaganda team stationed in the town, the members of the Revolutionary Committee, except for one person on duty, all carried bags, rolled up their trousers, and went barefoot to the production front lines. They listened to the opinions and demands of the masses regarding the work of the Revolutionary Committee. A few days later, the Revolutionary Committee received a phone call from the Banmao Brigade, stating that a committee member had come to understand some situations but then went to another brigade, and the existing problems had not been resolved. The propaganda team believed this was not a small matter but a reflection of the old work style of not being deeply rooted among the masses. However, the members of the Revolutionary Committee did not pay much attention to this issue. Originally, some committee members thought that after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the organization had become smaller and the personnel fewer, and this work was almost done, achieving its purpose. Now, the focus should be on work, neglecting the inevitable conflicts between the new organization and old thoughts, old styles, and old habits, and thus not being alert to the signs of conflict.

Therefore, the propaganda team and the responsible persons of the Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting to study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. Everyone believed that streamlining and reducing bureaucracy seemed to have achieved its purpose in terms of reducing personnel, but the struggle against old thoughts and old styles was just beginning. The old organization had changed, but people's old thoughts and old styles had not been thoroughly changed. Everyone also recalled the painful lessons of the past: after the "Four Clean-ups," a round of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy was also carried out. However, because old thoughts and old styles were not thoroughly broken, and ideological revolutionary transformation was not achieved, cadres still remained aloof, and within two months, the personnel who had been streamlined returned to the offices, and even more personnel were added. This made everyone deeply realize that only by continuously breaking old thoughts, old styles, old habits, and old rules, and carrying out thorough revolution, can one prevent the restoration of old thoughts and old organizations.

To thoroughly break old thoughts, old habits, and old rules, the Revolutionary Committee held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, bringing back the personnel who had gone to the front lines to participate in the study. In the study class, everyone put forward the opinions of the masses regarding the streamlined Revolutionary Committee and then, with questions in mind, studied Mao Zedong's works to distinguish between Chairman Mao's line of political power construction and the revisionist line of political power construction by Liu Shaoqi. Many comrades voluntarily examined their own old thoughts and old styles of being detached from politics and the masses, and angrily listed the harms of the old organization as a target for constant criticism.

The Revolutionary Committee also moved the class to break old thoughts and old styles to the places where class struggle was most intense. The Banmao Brigade had intense class struggle, and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and traitors and spies saw that after the streamlining, the personnel of the Revolutionary Committee had gone deep into the grassroots level in large numbers, and began to spread rumors, saying, "In the past, there were so many personnel in the office, and you still couldn't do anything. Now, with a few people, what problems can you solve?" and even boasting, "In a few months, you will return to the old ways." The Revolutionary Committee moved the study class on Mao Zedong Thought to this brigade and fought side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, exposing the class enemies.

Everyone saw from the sabotage of the class enemies the struggle between the two lines of political power construction and said: The organization has been reduced, but the intense struggle between the two classes, two thoughts, and two lines of who will win and who will lose is still ongoing, and we cannot have the idea of "good enough." We must thoroughly transform old thoughts and change old styles and cannot give the class enemies any opportunity.

After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, some cadres went to the brigades to stay and work, but they still worked in separate fields and could not break the old business frameworks. The masses gave the Revolutionary Committee feedback, saying, "You can't be like spiders spinning webs, each doing their own thing!" In response to this situation, the comrades from the propaganda team introduced in detail the experience of the Logistics Department of a certain regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, breaking the old frameworks, and going out of the office to serve the regiment and the soldiers wholeheartedly. Then, the comrades from the propaganda team and the Revolutionary Committee went to the masses to fight against old concepts, old systems, old rules, and old frameworks. Once, the masses of the Shibao Brigade reflected that the accountant of the brigade had a bad style and the accounts were not clear. The Revolutionary Committee asked the accountant, Wen Chao, to go down and investigate. After he went down, he organized a few people to check the accounts and found that the discrepancies were not large. He announced the results of the investigation and returned. The comrades from the propaganda team learned about this situation and went with him to the brigade to investigate again. This time, they went deep into the masses, listened to the reflections of the masses, and with Wen Chao, studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "Never forget class struggle." Then, they mobilized the masses to investigate and study from the accounts to the outside, from economics to politics, inside and outside, and the results not only exposed that the accountant had embezzled more than 200 yuan but also exposed that he was a bad element who participated in a counter-revolutionary organization. This incident gave Wen Chao a great education. He said: "I have been an accountant for eleven years, and this is the first time I have jumped out of the business circle and calculated a political account. Now I realize that an accountant cannot just manage economic accounts; more importantly, he should manage political accounts and grasp class struggle. If every day you just focus on money and accounts, without asking about politics and class struggle, you are a fool, you are sleeping on the guillotine of the class enemy. To break old thoughts and old styles, first, you must break the style of not emphasizing politics. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Political work is the lifeline of all economic work,' I am an accountant of the proletarian political power organization, in all aspects, the first thing is to grasp class struggle." The Revolutionary Committee seized this typical case and organized a sharing session, immediately launching a great revolution to break old thoughts and old styles.

Now, although the work of the Revolutionary Committee has been generally divided, the divisions do not separate families, and mutual boundaries are broken. Party, government, finance, literature, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and various industries all grasp politics and class struggle. Each comrade is a political worker and a commander and fighter in class struggle. Those in charge of production go to the grassroots level first to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promote revolution and production, and promote work, fully demonstrating that the Revolutionary Committee is a combat command center leading the masses in class struggle. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee, after going deep into the masses, urgently address the urgent needs of the masses, understand the demands of the masses, and solve the difficulties of the masses. The Fuli Brigade has repeatedly requested over the years to build a dam and install a water pump. However, due to the bureaucratic style of the old organization and the complicated procedures, it has not been approved. After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, Ji Xinyong, went to this brigade to stay and work, understood the demands of the masses, and immediately reported to the Revolutionary Committee, organizing the masses to start construction. The entire brigade, men, women, old, and young, worked together, and in three days, built a dam, installed a water pump, and also installed a rice-hulling machine, irrigating dozens of acres of dry land and solving the rice-hulling problem for the entire brigade, allowing the Li and Miao ethnic minorities to get rid of the long-term heavy physical labor of manual rice pounding. The masses praised, "It is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership. The Revolutionary Committee speaks and acts, all in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants."

### 通什镇革委会在解放军帮助下狠抓思想革命化建设  不断破除旧思想旧作风旧习惯  大力巩固精兵简政的胜利成果

    通什镇革委会在解放军帮助下狠抓思想革命化建设
    不断破除旧思想旧作风旧习惯
    大力巩固精兵简政的胜利成果
    本报讯　海南军区某部驻通什镇的毛泽东思想宣传队，在公社革委会实行精兵简政以后，帮助公社革委会不断加强思想革命化建设，解决了新机构同旧思想、旧作风的矛盾，巩固了精兵简政的胜利成果。
    通什镇公社革委会成立后，几次大抓精兵简政，人员减少了百分之三十七，广大革命群众都为这个革命措施叫好。在驻镇毛泽东思想宣传队的提议下，革委会成员除留一人值班外，其余的都背着背包，挽起裤腿，赤脚下到生产第一线，倾听群众对革委会工作的意见和要求。几天后，革委会接到番茅大队一个电话，大队的同志说：“革委会一个委员来了解了一些情况后就到别的大队去了，存在的问题依然没有得到解决。”宣传队认为这不是一件小事情，是旧的不深入群众的工作作风的反映。但是，革委会的同志对这件事却不大注意。原来，一些委员认为精兵简政后，机构由大变小了，人员由多变少了，这项工作做得差不多了，目的已经达到了。现在应当把精力用在抓工作上去，忽视了精兵简政后的新机构同旧思想、旧作风、旧习惯必然要发生的矛盾，因而对矛盾的讯号没有引起警惕。
    于是，宣传队和革委会负责人一起召开常委会，学习了毛主席的有关指示。大家认为精兵简政从人员减少看似乎目的达到了，但是一场同旧思想、旧作风的斗争还刚刚开始。旧机构变了，但人们的旧思想、旧作风远远没有彻底改变。大家还联想到过去的沉痛教训：四清结束后，当时也进行了一次精兵简政。但是因为没有大破旧思想、旧作风，没有实现思想革命化，干部依然高高在上，不到两个月被精简的人员又回到了机关，而且还增加了人员。这使大家深深认识到，只有不断地破除旧思想、旧作风、旧习惯、旧规矩，进行彻底革命，才能免于旧思想和旧机构的复辟。
    为了彻底破除旧思想、旧习惯、旧规矩，革命委员会举办了毛泽东思想学习班，把下到第一线工作的人员抽回来参加学习。在学习班里，让大家把群众对精简后革委会的意见摆出来，然后带着问题，学习毛主席著作，分清什么是毛主席的政权建设路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义政权建设路线。不少同志自觉地检查了自己脱离政治、脱离群众，做官当老爷的旧思想、旧作风，愤怒地把旧机构的害处列成罪状公布于众，作为经常批判的靶子。
    革委会还把破旧思想、旧作风的学习班搬到阶级斗争最尖锐的地方去办。番茅大队阶级斗争十分激烈，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏和叛徒、特务，看到精简后革委会人员大批深入基层时，便煽阴风，点鬼火，说什么“过去你们机关人员那么多，都还干不出名堂来，现在几个人能解决什么问题”，“人这么少，机构这么小，越来越不能办事了”。甚至叫嚣“过不了几个月你们还会变回去”。革委会就把毛泽东思想学习班搬到这个大队，和贫下中农并肩战斗，揪出了阶级敌人。
    大家从阶级敌人的破坏看到了两条政权建设路线的斗争，都说：机构缩小了，但是，两个阶级、两种思想、两条路线谁胜谁负的斗争，依然激烈地进行着，可不能有“差不多”的想法。我们一定要彻底改造旧思想、改变旧作风，不能使阶级敌人有机可乘。
    精兵简政后，有的干部下队蹲点，还是各干一行，不能打破旧的业务框框。群众给革委会提意见说：“你们可不能象蜘蛛结网各打各啊！”针对这种情况，宣传队的同志详细地介绍了广州军区某团后勤处活学活用毛泽东思想，大破条条框框，走出机关全心全意为连队服务为战士服务的经验。然后，宣传队的同志又和革委会的同志一起，到群众中斗旧观念、旧制度、旧条条、旧框框。有一次，什保大队的群众反映，大队会计作风很坏，账目不清。革委会要会计文超下去调查。他下去后，组织几个人把账目一清查，觉得出入不大，把清查的结果一公布就回来了。宣传队的同志了解到这种情况，就和他一起再到这个大队调查。这次，他们深入到群众中，听取群众的反映，和文超一起学习毛主席指示：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”然后发动群众从账内到账外，从经济到政治，内内外外作了调查研究，结果不仅清查出这个会计贪污了二百多元，而且还清查出这是一个参加反革命组织的坏人。这件事给文超教育很大。他说：“我当了十一年会计，第一次跳出业务圈子，算了一笔政治账。现在我认识到，一个会计不能单管经济账，更重要的是管政治账，抓阶级斗争。如果每天只是把眼珠盯在钱上账上，不问政治，不问阶级斗争，就是糊涂人，就是枕着阶级敌人的铡刀睡大觉。要破旧思想、旧作风，首先要破除不突出政治的思想作风。毛主席教导我们：‘政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线’，我是无产阶级政权机构的会计，千条万条，狠抓阶级斗争是第一条。”革委会抓住了这个典型，组织了一次讲用会，立即掀起一场大破旧思想、旧作风的大革命。
    现在，革委会工作虽然经过一般分工，但是，分工不分家，互相打破业务界限，党政财文，农林牧副渔各行各业，都抓政治，抓阶级斗争。每个同志都是政治工作人员，都是阶级斗争的指挥员、战斗员。管生产的人员下基层去，首先办好毛泽东思想学习班，抓革命促生产，促工作，充分显示了革命委员会是领导群众进行阶级斗争的战斗指挥部。革命委员会的同志深入群众后，急群众所急，了解群众的要求，解决群众的困难。福利大队几年来多次要求修一条水坝，安装一部水轮泵。可是，由于旧机构的官僚作风，手续繁多，一直没有得到批准。精兵简政后，革委会副主任吉迅勇下到这个大队蹲点，了解到群众这项要求，及时报告革委会，立即组织群众动工。全队男女老少一起动手，三天就修好了一条水坝，安装了水轮泵，还安装了碾米机，既灌溉了几十亩旱田，又解决了全队的碾米问题，使这个大队的黎、苗族同胞摆脱了长期以来手工舂米的笨重体力劳动。群众赞扬说：“都是毛主席领导得好，革命委员会说话、办事，都贴在我们贫下中农心坎上。”（王来斌、琼卫东）
