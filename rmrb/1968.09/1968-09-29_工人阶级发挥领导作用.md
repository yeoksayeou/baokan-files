The revolutionary tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation surges forward.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao, the working class of our country has proudly taken the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure, fully playing a leading role. In the struggle, the working class listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, acts the most according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and is the most able to unite the majority of cadres and the masses. They possess a fearless revolutionary spirit and a noble communist style.

The following are a few stories that recently happened in the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory in Shenyang.

Workers Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Are the Smartest

Late at night, in one of the carriages of the 306th ordinary passenger train departing from Shenyang Station, most of the passengers had already fallen asleep, but seventeen workers were still wide awake, chatting and discussing enthusiastically in small groups.

It turned out that these seventeen workers were the "workers' learning team" sent by the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory in Shenyang to a certain factory in Shandong for training. In recent days, revolutionary cadres and workers had raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the revisionist line of "expert management" and "management by a few people" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and decided to take the road of cultivating enterprise management personnel from the masses of workers. The entire factory's workers, in order to better grasp the revolution and promote production, proposed to reform the production process. The revolutionary committee of the factory adopted the suggestions of the masses and decided to select workers with practical experience from the entire factory to learn advanced production technology from other factories.

On the train, the veteran worker Zhang, who was in charge of the team, studied with everyone the latest instructions from Chairman Mao on "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation" and "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." Zhang said, "Chairman Mao calls on us, the working class, to lead everything, but the Chinese Khrushchev says workers can't manage factories, letting capitalists manage factories, setting up a set of rules and regulations, not allowing workers to interfere with production technology. This time, we will break through this revisionist framework with actual actions and fight a good battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation."

The workers studied Chairman Mao's teachings while criticizing the revisionist factory management line of the Chinese Khrushchev, becoming more and more excited as they talked.

Chairman Mao said, "The smartest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." In the production workshop, the workers seriously learned from the experiences of other factories. The veteran worker Liu Yingchang was attracted by the acid mixing operation in the acid washing section. Previously, the quality of phosphoric acid mixing in the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory had never been up to standard, and the phosphoric acid had to be changed every two or three days, costing the state tens of thousands of yuan, wasting a large amount of national funds, and affecting production. Liu had proposed several times to go to other factories to learn and solve this "old difficult problem." However, there was a capitalist acting as a technical expert in the factory who knew nothing about technology and production but acted like an "authority," saying, "A big rough worker, what can he learn!" He himself had gone to this factory several times for "training," but all he brought back was a bunch of foreign "data," without solving any problems. This time, Liu saw the operation method and immediately discovered the production process rules of various different acids entering the tank, quickly coming up with a plan to reform the phosphoric acid tank in his own factory. After four days of intense study, these seventeen workers formulated a reform plan for the entire factory's production process and returned to the factory on the sixth day. Many workers proudly said, "In the past, reactionary technical 'authorities' went to other factories for training for several months, traveling half of China but couldn't learn anything, but our workers' learning team only took seven days and solved a bunch of problems. Let's see who has the ability!"

Working Among the Masses

Just as the workday began, Gao Yingcheng, the deputy director of the revolutionary committee of the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory in Shenyang, strode towards the daycare center.

Why did he go to the daycare center?

It turned out that a few days ago, the revolutionary committee had decided on a new office system: to move the office to the masses, working wherever they go. Gao Yingcheng is an old worker in the factory. He thought: the new office system decided by the revolutionary committee fully conforms to the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses," and we must implement it word for word. Today, he came to the daycare center to work for the first time.

As soon as Gao Yingcheng entered the daycare center gate, the caregivers welcomed him with smiles, saying, "Teacher Gao, what brings you here?" "I came here to work." Saying this, Gao Yingcheng started chatting with the caregivers. He first opened the Little Red Book and read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people, and everything we do is for the people." Then he said, "We members of the revolutionary committee are servants of the people. If you have any requests, just tell us."

Gao Yingcheng said this, and the caregivers were very happy, starting to talk one after another: "Here, the leaders rarely came in the past. Look, the small door is broken and no one repairs it, the window glass is broken and no one installs it." Gao Yingcheng listened and thought: what they raised is not only the problem of the daycare center, but also an angry accusation and criticism of the old system and old style, giving himself a vivid lesson on the two-line struggle. He immediately replied, "You raised good points! These few things, I will take care of them right away."

Then, Gao Yingcheng walked into the inner room where the children sleep and carefully inspected it. Then he said to the caregivers, "The environment of the daycare center needs to be well arranged. All four walls should have Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations from Chairman Mao, so that the children can see Chairman Mao every day and plant the roots of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao in their hearts from a young age." The caregivers heard this and unanimously said, "We will definitely do it right away!"

Gao Yingcheng left not long after, and he personally led the carpenters back to the daycare center. After helping the carpenters repair the doors and windows, he returned to the workshop to work.

The next day, Gao Yingcheng brought a roll of Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations from Chairman Mao to the daycare center for the third time. Soon, a few workers also came. They together repainted the walls with whitewash, cleaned the inside and outside of the house, and pasted Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations from Chairman Mao on all four walls.

The daycare center was transformed and looked brand new. The caregivers couldn't contain their joy and excitedly said, "Teacher Gao really does things thoroughly! He solved the problems of the daycare center in one go, and in the past, it would have taken a lot of effort to do so!"

### 工人阶级发挥领导作用

    工人阶级发挥领导作用
    斗、批、改的革命洪流滚滚向前。
    在毛主席的伟大号召下，我国工人阶级豪迈地登上了上层建筑斗批改的舞台，充分地发挥着领导作用。工人阶级在斗争的实践中，最听毛主席的话，最能按照毛主席的指示办事，最能团结干部和群众的大多数，具有大无畏的革命精神，具有高尚的共产主义风格。
    下面是最近发生在沈阳市无缝钢管厂里的几个故事。
    毛泽东思想武装的工人最聪明
    深夜，从沈阳车站开出的三○六次普通旅客列车的一节车厢里，大部分旅客都已经休息了，唯有十七个工人没有一点倦意，还三三两两兴致勃勃地畅谈着，议论着……。
    原来，这十七个工人，是沈阳市无缝钢管厂派到山东某厂去见习的“工人取经队”。前些日子，广大革命职工高举革命批判大旗，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”、靠少数人办企业的修正主义路线，决心走从工人群众中培养企业管理人员的道路。全厂工人群众，为了更好地抓革命促生产，提出要改革生产工艺过程。厂革委会采纳了群众的建议，决定在全厂工人群众中选派有实践经验的工人到外厂学习生产工艺的先进经验。
    在列车上，负责带队的老工人庄师傅，和大家一起学习了毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”，“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示。庄师傅说：“毛主席叫咱们工人阶级领导一切，可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说工人管不好工厂，让资本家管理工厂，定了一套规章制度，不让工人过问生产工艺，这次咱们要以实际行动，破掉这个修正主义的框框，打好斗、批、改这一仗。”
    工人们一边学习毛主席的教导，一边批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办厂路线，越谈心情越激动。
    毛主席说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”工人们在生产车间里，认真学习兄弟厂的经验。酸洗工段的老工人刘英昌被人家的配酸操作吸引住了。过去，无缝钢管厂磷酸的配酸质量一直没有过关，三天两天要换一次价值几千元的磷酸，既浪费了国家大量资金，又影响了生产。刘师傅曾几次提出要去外厂学习，解决这个“老大难”问题。可是，厂里有个资本家当技术员，对技术一窍不通，对生产一门不懂，却俨然摆出一副“权威”的臭架子，说：“一个大老粗，能学个什么！”而他自己却曾多次跑到这个厂里去“见习”，结果，只抄回来一大堆洋“数据”，根本没有解决问题。这回刘师傅一看人家的操作方法，就发现各种不同的酸入槽反应的工艺规律，很快想出了改革本厂磷酸槽的方案。经过四天的紧张学习，这十七个工人就制定出了全厂整个生产工艺的改革方案，并且在第六天就返回了厂里。很多工人自豪地说：“过去反动技术‘权威’到外面见习几个月，逛半个中国也学不出名堂，我们工人取经队只用了七天时间，却解决了一大堆问题，看看到底谁有能耐！”
    在群众中办公
    刚刚上班，沈阳市无缝钢管厂革委会副主任高应城便迈着大步，朝托儿所走去。
    他为什么要到托儿所去？
    原来前几天，革委会定了一项新的办公制度：把办公室搬到群众中去，走到那里，就在那里办公。高应城是厂里的老工人，他想：革委会定的这项新的办公制度，完全符合伟大领袖毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，咱一定要一字不差地贯彻执行。今天，他第一次到托儿所来办公。
    高应城一进托儿所大门，保育员们就笑着迎上去说：“高师傅，来托儿所有啥事？”“我到这里来办公。”说着，高应城就和保育员们唠了起来。他首先打开红宝书，读了一段毛主席语录：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。然后接着说：“我们革委会成员都是人民的勤务员，你们有啥要求，就尽管提吧。”
    高应城这么一说，保育员们非常高兴，就你一言，我一语地说开了：“我们这里，过去领导很少来。你看，小门坏了没人给修，窗户玻璃打了也没人给安。”高应城一面听，一面想：她们提的不仅是托儿所的问题，而且是对旧机构旧作风的愤怒控诉和批判，给自己上了一堂生动的两条路线教育课。他当时就回答说：“你们提得好！这几件事，我回头就办。”
    接着，高应城就走进孩子们睡觉的里屋，仔细看了一遍。然后对保育员们说：“托儿所的环境要很好地布置一下。四面墙上都要贴毛主席像和毛主席语录，让孩子们天天看见毛主席，从小在心里扎下对毛主席无限忠诚的根子。”保育员们听了齐声说：“我们一定马上办！”
    高应城走了不一会，就亲自领着木工又来到了托儿所。他帮助木工们把门窗修理好后，才回到车间去办公。
    第二天，高应城又捧着一卷毛主席像和毛主席语录，第三次来到托儿所。随后，几位工人也来了，他们一起给墙上重新刷了白灰，屋里屋外打扫得干干净净，四面墙上贴满了毛主席像和毛主席语录。
    托儿所变得焕然一新。保育员们抑制不住内心的高兴，激动地说：“高师傅办事真彻底啊！一下就把托儿所的问题解决了，要是在过去还不知要费多少口舌呢！”      沈炮政
