The drums of armed struggle echo across the equator. African patriotic armed forces launch fierce attacks on Portuguese colonial troops.

BEIJING, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) — The patriotic armed forces of the "Portuguese" colonies in Africa, who have long been engaged in armed struggle, continue to launch attacks on the 120,000 Portuguese colonial troops supported by the North Atlantic aggression bloc led by the United States. Recently, they have achieved new victories in annihilating the enemy's combat forces and consolidating guerrilla bases.

	Victories Achieved by Guinea-Bissau Patriotic Forces
	Fierce Attacks on Enemy Strongholds, Annihilating Enemy Forces

	In West Africa's Guinea-Bissau, the patriotic armed forces, who have been engaged in armed struggle for over seven years, have liberated vast areas in the south and north and are now advancing towards the east and west, where the enemy is entrenched. In recent months, they have launched attacks on several important enemy strongholds in the east, achieving continuous victories. According to reports, in mid-June, the patriotic armed forces launched a fierce attack on the Portuguese colonial troops' stronghold in Bele, the capital of the Bué region in the east. Under the relentless attacks of the patriotic armed forces, the Portuguese colonial troops suffered heavy losses and were forced to withdraw from this important stronghold. At the same time as the attack on the Bele stronghold, the Guinea-Bissau patriotic armed forces launched a powerful assault on another enemy stronghold, the Mansoa military camp, on June 19. The patriotic armed forces successfully destroyed part of the colonial military command headquarters and almost all the barracks that constituted the defense system of this stronghold, killing more than 30 enemy soldiers.

	In recent months, the Guinea-Bissau patriotic armed forces have also intensified their attacks on Portuguese colonial naval vessels and ships in the rivers of the north and south, sinking or damaging 15 enemy ships, further isolating some of the main enemy camps that rely on river transport for supplies.

	Mozambique Patriotic Forces Consolidate Guerrilla Bases
	While Strengthening Annihilation of the Enemy, Intensifying Production

	The patriotic armed forces fighting in southeastern Africa's Mozambique, after four years of heroic struggle, have already controlled vast areas in the north and northeast and are now advancing towards the west. In recent periods, the patriotic armed forces have intensified their activities to annihilate Portuguese colonial troops. According to reports, in June and July, the Mozambique patriotic armed forces launched ten attacks on the enemy in the northern provinces of Delgado and Niassa, annihilating more than 100 enemy soldiers. Previously, from March 15 to May 14, the Mozambique patriotic armed forces annihilated more than 140 Portuguese colonial troops in the western province of Tete and the northern province of Niassa.

	While fighting and annihilating the enemy, the Mozambique patriotic armed forces have organized the masses to produce grain in some areas of the Delgado and Niassa provinces and have established some agricultural production organizations. According to reports, the production of sorghum, rice, and corn in these areas has recently increased significantly. In these areas, the patriotic armed forces have also established their own commercial systems. The medical, cultural, and educational conditions of the residents in these areas are also improving.

	Angolan Patriotic Forces Strengthen Their Ranks
	Mobilize the Masses and Intensify Political Education

	The patriotic armed forces active in southwestern Africa's Angola are continuing armed struggle in some areas of the north, east, and central regions of Angola, repeatedly attacking the enemy and annihilating the enemy's combat forces, achieving one victory after another. From March to June, the patriotic armed forces killed and wounded more than 600 Portuguese colonial troops. On April 23, the patriotic armed forces completely annihilated an enemy force stationed in Dala, in the northeastern province of Lunda, destroying the Dala administrative stronghold and burning six enemy military vehicles.

	From August 10 to 15, Angolan guerrilla fighters killed more than 30 Portuguese colonial troops in a few days.

	To strengthen the armed forces and more effectively strike the enemy, the Angolan patriotic armed forces pay attention to mobilizing the masses and intensifying political education for the guerrilla fighters. They emphasize the importance of political education, believing that the correct political direction and actions in a people's war are decisive factors in achieving the initiative in both political and military terms.

	The Angolan patriotic armed forces also pay attention to the work of the people in the enemy-occupied areas, mobilizing the people in the enemy-occupied areas to fight against the "forced labor law" and to refuse to pay various oppressive taxes to the enemy.

	The Days of the Portuguese Colonial Regime Are Getting Worse

	Colonial Troops Lack Manpower and Morale Is Very Low

	Under the protection of the North Atlantic aggression bloc led by the United States, the days of the Portuguese colonialist regime are getting worse. It is already stuck with 120,000 colonial troops in Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Angola. Due to a lack of manpower, the Portuguese colonial authorities have forcibly extended the military service period and even require women to serve in the military. Under the continuous attacks of the patriotic armed forces and the organized people, the morale of the Portuguese colonial troops is very low, and desertion incidents frequently occur. Some even flee during battles. On June 30, in the Delgado province, when the Mozambique guerrillas attacked the Portuguese "strategic village" of Namwambo, the colonial troops almost did not resist and fled, and the guerrillas liberated the residents there.

    武装斗争的战鼓响彻赤道上空
    非洲爱国武装向葡殖民军发动猛烈进攻
    新华社四日讯　长期坚持武装斗争的非洲“葡属”殖民地爱国武装力量，不断向得到以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团支持的十二万葡萄牙殖民军发动进攻，最近在歼灭敌人有生力量和巩固游击基地方面又取得了新的胜利。
    几内亚（比绍）爱国武装取得新胜利
    猛袭敌军据点歼灭敌人有生力量
    在西非的几内亚（比绍），坚持了七年多武装斗争的爱国武装力量，在解放了南部和北部的广大地区后，正在向敌人盘踞的东部和西部地区推进。最近几个月中，他们向东部敌军的一些重要据点发起攻击，不断取得胜利。据报道，爱国武装力量六月中旬向葡萄牙殖民军在东部布伊地区的首府贝利据点发动猛烈进攻。在爱国武装力量不断打击下，葡萄牙殖民军在遭到重大损失后，被迫撤离这个重要据点。在袭击贝利敌军据点的同时，几内亚（比绍）爱国武装力量六月十九日向敌军的另一个据点曼苏瓦军营发起强大袭击，爱国武装力量一举摧毁了这个军营的殖民军司令部的一部分和构成这个据点的防御体系的几乎所有的营房，打死敌军三十多人。
    在最近几个月中，几内亚（比绍）爱国武装力量还在北部和南部的河道上，加强对葡萄牙殖民军舰艇和船只的袭击，击沉、击伤殖民军船只十五艘，进一步孤立了殖民军的一些主要靠河道运送补给的重要兵营。
      莫三鼻给爱国武装巩固游击基地
      一面加强歼敌一面加紧生产
    战斗在非洲东南部的莫三鼻给爱国武装力量，经过四年的英勇斗争，已经控制了北部和东北部的广大地区，并正向西部发展。最近一个时期，爱国武装力量加强了歼灭葡萄牙殖民军的活动。据报道，莫三鼻给爱国武装力量六七月间在北部的德尔加多角省和尼亚萨省对敌人发动了十次袭击，歼灭敌人一百多名。在这以前，莫三鼻给爱国武装力量从三月十五日到五月十四日期间，在西部的太特省和北部的尼亚萨省歼灭了葡萄牙殖民军一百四十多名。
    莫三鼻给爱国武装力量在打击和歼灭敌人的同时，在德尔加多角省和尼亚萨省的一些地区，发动群众生产粮食，并建立一些农业生产组织。据报道，这些地区的高粱、稻子、玉米等产量最近有很大增加。在这些地区，爱国武装力量还建立了自己的商业体系。这些地区的居民的医疗、文化教育状况，也正在改善。
      安哥拉爱国武装壮大自己队伍
      大力发动群众　加强政治教育工作
    活跃在非洲西南部的安哥拉爱国武装力量，正在安哥拉的北部、东部和中部的一些地区，坚持武装斗争，不断袭击敌人，消灭敌人的有生力量，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在三月到六月期间，爱国武装力量打死打伤六百多名葡萄牙殖民军。四月二十三日，爱国武装力量全歼驻扎在东北部隆达省达拉的一支敌军，摧毁了达拉的行政据点，烧毁敌军军车六辆。
    在八月十日到十五日的几天中，安哥拉游击队战士又打死三十多名葡萄牙殖民军。
    为了壮大武装力量队伍，更有力地打击敌人，安哥拉爱国武装力量注意发动群众和加强对游击战士的政治教育工作。他们强调政治教育的重要性，认为人民战争的正确的政治方向和正确的行动是在政治上和军事上取得主动的决定因素。
    安哥拉爱国武装力量还注意做敌占区人民的工作，发动敌占区人民开展反对“强迫劳工法”和拒绝向敌人交纳苛捐杂税的斗争。
    葡萄牙殖民政权日子越来越不好过
    殖民军兵力不足士气十分低落
    在以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团卵翼下的葡萄牙殖民主义政权，日子越来越不好过。它陷在几内亚（比绍）、莫三鼻给和安哥拉的殖民军就已达十二万。由于兵力不足，葡萄牙殖民当局强行规定，延长服兵役期限，妇女也要服兵役。在爱国武装力量和组织起来的人民的不断打击下，葡萄牙殖民军的士气十分低落，开小差的事件时常发生，有的则临阵脱逃。六月三十日，在德尔加多角省，莫三鼻给游击队袭击纳姆万多的葡萄牙“战略村”时，殖民军几乎毫不抵抗就逃跑了，游击队解放了那里的居民。
