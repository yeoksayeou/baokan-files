The reactionary Japanese government, in order to adapt to the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, is accelerating the revival of militarism and intensifying military buildup. It has significantly increased the military budget for the next fiscal year.

According to a report by a Japanese bourgeois newspaper on August 30, the Japanese "Defense Agency," based on the "Third Expansion Plan," announced on August 29 the military budget (draft) for the 1969 fiscal year, totaling 497.7 billion yen. This is an increase of approximately 18 percent, or 75.6 billion yen, compared to the 1968 fiscal year.

According to the _Asahi Shimbun_, the draft budget for the next fiscal year does not yet include the costs of new fighter jets and other equipment that the "Self-Defense Forces" plan to adopt. If these costs are added, it is estimated that the actual military spending for the next fiscal year will likely approach the total military spending of the "First Expansion Plan" (from 1957 to 1961), which was 647.6 billion yen.

According to the _Asahi Shimbun_, based on this budget draft, the Japanese "Defense Agency" will deploy a new ground-to-air Nike-type missile unit in the central region of Hokkaido next fiscal year. It also plans to build escort ships, submarines, and various types of aircraft and tanks. In addition, it will increase the number of troops by 7,800.

    日本反动政府大幅度增加军费
    日本反动政府为了适应美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的需要，加速复活军国主义，加紧扩军备战，大幅度地增加明年度的军费预算。
    据日本资产阶级报纸八月三十日透露，日本“防卫厅”根据“第三次扩军计划”，二十 九日公布了一九六九年度的军费预算（草案）总额为四千九百七十七亿日元，比一九六八年度约增加百分之十八，即增加七百五十六亿日元。
    据《朝日新闻》透露，明年度预算草案中，还没有包括日本“自卫队”准备采用的新型战斗机等费用，如果把这些费用加上去，估计明年度的实际军费，看来，大约接近“第一次扩军计划”（从一九五七年到一九六一年）的军费总额六千四百七十六亿日元。
    据《朝日新闻》报道，根据这次的预算草案，日本“防卫厅”明年度将在北海道中部地区配备新的地对空奈克式的导弹部队，并且计划建造“护卫舰”、潜水艇等军舰和各种飞机、坦克等武器。此外，还增加兵员七千八百人。
