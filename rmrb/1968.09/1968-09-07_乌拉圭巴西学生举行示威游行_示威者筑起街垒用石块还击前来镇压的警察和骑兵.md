Uruguayan and Brazilian students have continued their struggle, protesting against the reactionary authorities' suppression.

In Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, hundreds of students held a protest march in the city center on the 3rd, protesting against the reactionary policies of the authorities. The protesting students set up barricades in the city center and bravely retaliated with stones against the police and cavalry that came to suppress them.

In Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, university students took to the streets on August 30th to strongly protest against the military dictatorship's dispatch of police to invade schools and arrest students. The Brazilian military dictatorship again sent police to suppress the protesting students, and the students bravely retaliated with stones against the police's attack.
