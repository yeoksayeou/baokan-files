The revolutionary situation is excellent and inspiring. A small group of counterrevolutionaries dreaming of a restoration have completely collapsed. The textile industry in Jiangsu presents a new look.

In the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers in the textile industry of Jiangsu Province, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and his great call to "must grasp cloth production tightly." The revolutionary and production situation is unprecedentedly excellent. The production of major products in the textile industry of the entire province has increased significantly month by month and quarter by quarter. The production of cotton yarn in the second quarter increased by 1.56 times compared to the first quarter, and there was further growth in July and August compared to the second quarter. A number of textile enterprises in Nantong, Wuxi, and other places have reached the highest production levels in history.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, all textile enterprises in the province have achieved revolutionary great unity, and the vast majority have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, various enterprises have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The spiritual and enterprise faces have undergone fundamental changes.

Jiangsu has many old textile enterprises, deeply influenced by feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, with sharp class struggles. Therefore, in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and his great call to "must grasp cloth production tightly," the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has been ongoing. The revolutionary committees at various levels and in various enterprises have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," leading the broad revolutionary masses to fiercely criticize the "class struggle extinction" theory of China's Khrushchev, criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center" theory, and launch a vigorous and relentless attack on the class enemies. They have smashed the class enemies' plots to restore capitalism and sabotage "grasp revolution, promote production." With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, the revolutionary workers of the Wuxi Hemp and Cotton Textile Mill have thoroughly smashed the "independent kingdom" controlled by a small group of capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies, making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire mill unprecedentedly excellent. It has become an advanced unit in the city's textile system, with production exceeding historical highs.

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." In implementing the great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary committees of various enterprises have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on revolution promoting production, and politics leading business. Many enterprises have consistently focused on revolutionary big criticism, thoroughly sweeping away the revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the textile industry. Many workshop and team sites have become battlefields for revolutionary big criticism.

Through revolutionary big criticism, the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses have been further heightened. Starting from criticizing China's Khrushchev, Wuxi Fourth Cotton Textile Mill has smashed the expert line and foreign frameworks, established the mass line, mobilized the masses, proposed projects themselves, set progress themselves, and implemented tasks themselves, completing the repair of 51 projects in four days.

Many textile enterprises' revolutionary workers have also extensively and deeply carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, becoming the greatest driving force for promoting and advancing the revolution and production in the textile industry. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, the broad masses of workers have firmly grasped the "use" character, implementing and carrying out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions with lightning speed. In the cotton spinning workshop of Wuxi Hemp and Cotton Textile Mill, 20 looms were changed to weave a type of canvas, with an initial qualified rate of only 20%. Through carrying out the "three loyalties" activity, the workers learned Chairman Mao's great call to "must grasp cloth production tightly," and the canvas qualified rate quickly rose to 85%. Many spinning mills insist on opening 19 to 20 shifts during the high-temperature season, which is unprecedented in history.

    形势大好振奋人心　一小撮妄想复辟的阶级敌人彻底垮台
    江苏纺织工业战线呈现崭新面貌
    革命的大联合、三结合日益巩固和发展，各项主要产品的产量逐月逐季大幅度上升，南通、无锡等地一批纺织企业的生产已达到历史上的最高水平
    新华社南京一日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，江苏省纺织工业战线上的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，革命和生产形势空前大好。全省纺织工业的各项主要产品的产量都逐月逐季大幅度上升，棉纱产量二季度比一季度增长一点五六倍，七、八月份比二季度又有增长。南通、无锡等地一批纺织企业的生产，已达到历史上的最高水平。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全省纺织企业全部实现了革命的大联合，绝大部分都实现了革命的三结合。在革委会领导下，各企业大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，落实了毛主席的一系列最新指示，人们的精神面貌和企业面貌发生了根本变化。
    江苏纺织工业老厂多，受封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的影响较深，阶级斗争比较尖锐，因此，在贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召的过程中，始终贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。各地、各企业的革委会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，率领广大革命职工，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，批判反动的资产阶级“多中心论”，发动群众向阶级敌人发起主动的猛烈的进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人复辟资本主义和破坏“抓革命，促生产”的阴谋。无锡麻棉纺织厂的革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，彻底摧毁了一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务所把持的“独立王国”以后，全厂革命、生产形势空前大好，成为全市纺织系统的一个先进单位，生产超过了历史的最高水平。
    “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”在贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，各企业的革委会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚持革命带动生产，政治统帅业务。许多企业自始至终狠抓革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人在纺织工业战线上推行的一些修正主义黑货。许多企业的车间、班组到处都成为革命大批判的战场。
    通过革命大批判，进一步提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。无锡第四棉纺织厂从批判中国赫鲁晓夫入手，大破专家路线和洋框框，大立群众路线，发动群众，自己提项目，自己定进度，自己落实任务，四天内完成了五十一个项目的检修任务。
    许多纺织企业的革命职工还广泛深入地开展了忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，成为推动和促进纺织工业战线上革命和生产的最大动力。广大职工怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，狠抓一个“用”字，雷厉风行地贯彻落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。无锡麻棉纺织厂棉线车间有二十台布机改织一种帆布，开始合格率只有百分之二十，通过开展“三忠于”活动，职工们学习了毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，帆布合格率迅速上升到百分之八十五。许多纱厂在高温季节坚持开出十九班到二十班，这是过去历史上所没有过的。
