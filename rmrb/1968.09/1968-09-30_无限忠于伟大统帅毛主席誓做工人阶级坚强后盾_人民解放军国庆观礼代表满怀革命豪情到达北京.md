The Chinese People's Liberation Army representatives attending the celebrations for the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China arrived in Beijing with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. They carried with them the unwavering proletarian feelings of the entire army towards the great leader Chairman Mao, and the determination to learn humbly from the working class and to be a strong backbone for the working class. They were filled with fighting spirit and the joy of victory.

The representatives from various units considered it their greatest honor and happiness to be sent to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations and to be inspected by Chairman Mao.

Before their departure, the units held rallies to pledge allegiance to Chairman Mao. Sailors and airmen from the Navy and Air Force worked day and night to embroider portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao to be brought to Beijing by the representatives. Soldiers on the desert and sentinels by the Heilongjiang River wrote letters expressing their determination to be presented to the beloved great leader Chairman Mao. On the plateau of Tibet and the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, soldiers guarding the border at night held the hands of the representatives, seeing them off again and again, with repeated instructions to convey their sentiments to Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life and good health!

Most of the representatives who arrived in Beijing came from the front lines of coastal defense, border defense, and the "Three Supports, Two Militaries." Some of them had made new achievements during the Cultural Revolution, while others were heroes and models who had defended the country's borders and won honors. They had longed to see Chairman Mao on their battlefields. Now, their wish was about to come true, and they were extremely excited. Representatives from advanced units such as the "Support the Left and Love the People Model Platoon," the late "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line - Menhe," the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," the "Steel Eighth Company on the South China Sea Front," the "Red Border Defense Team of Qiaogela," the "Aerial Eagles Regiment," the "People-Loving Model Company," and the "Tenth Engineering Company of the Wind and Snow Plateau Loyal to Chairman Mao" spent sleepless nights eagerly studying Chairman Mao's teachings, or wrote diaries and poems in tears to praise the great leader Chairman Mao.

A squad leader from a certain unit, Guo Jiacheng, who was awarded a first-class merit citation, thought of Chairman Mao during an emergency battle mission, overcame all difficulties, and achieved a brilliant victory. He said passionately, "I will cherish this happiest moment of seeing Chairman Mao and let it inspire me to advance victoriously forever." A company commander from a certain unit, Wang Bingnan, who had performed new feats for the people during the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," was seriously injured while fighting a major fire to save the lives and property of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the hospital, his first request upon regaining consciousness was to see a portrait of Chairman Mao. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought guided him to create miracles, and it also helped him overcome his injuries. Now, he wrote with his disabled hand: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You gave me a second life. I will fight for your revolutionary line while alive and dedicate my life to your revolutionary line when dead."

Activists and model figures such as Nian Siwang, Liu Xubao, Zhang Zhenxi, Zhang Weiliang, Chen Wenyi, Zhang Chunyu, Gao Huicheng, Wang Wenyu, Hu Bingjin, Zhou Shuping, Wang Kehong, Zhu Binghua, and Cai Ziquan arrived in the capital. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to learn from the working class and to be a strong backbone for the working class during the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In the afternoon of the 28th, all the representatives gathered at Tiananmen Square. In front of the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, they solemnly swore: We will definitely take the respected Vice Commander Lin Biao as a shining example, forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and achieve new victories in the struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.
