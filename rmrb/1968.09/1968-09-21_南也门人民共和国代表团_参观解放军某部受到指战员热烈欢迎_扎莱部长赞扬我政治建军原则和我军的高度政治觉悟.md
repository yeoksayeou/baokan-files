South Yemen Foreign Minister Safi Ahmad Zale and the delegation of the People's Republic of South Yemen, led by him, visited and inspected a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing today, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi. They were warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers.

Minister Zale and the delegation listened to the unit's leaders report on the achievements made in implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's military thought and military line. They heard a report from an active learner of Chairman Mao's works on their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They observed a live-fire demonstration of infantry weapons, visited fields cultivated by the unit, a rice processing plant, an armaments repair shop, and a tofu processing room. They also watched a performance by the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought, which consisted of soldiers.

Minister Zale said during the visit, "We have personally seen how great People's China cultivates great soldiers. Your principles of military building are to build the military politically. Today, we have indeed seen Mao Zedong Thought in your soldiers."

He said, "Your army has a high level of political awareness and proficient military skills, and also engages in agricultural and sideline production. Your army truly lightens the burden on the government. As far as I know, this is something that no army in any other country in the world does."

The South Yemen friends also visited the Beijing Knitting Factory yesterday and were warmly welcomed by the workers.
