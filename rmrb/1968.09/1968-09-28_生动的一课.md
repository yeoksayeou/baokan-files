	Let the voices soar in songs of praise,
	Let the iron arms strike the gongs.
	The working class must lead everything,
	Everyone is joyful, celebrating together.

	Zhang, the master craftsman, over sixty years old,
	His wrinkles dance with joy.
	He raises the flag and strides forward,
	His toothless mouth smiles broadly!

	"Come, young students!
	A rough old man will give you a lesson..."

	Zhang, the master craftsman, opens his shirt, baring his chest,
	The scars from the whip are a foot long...

	What is oppression, what is exploitation,
	What is hardship, what is hunger...

	Zhang, the master craftsman, speaks fluently and logically,
	What a vivid political lesson!

	Who says "exploitation is beneficial"?
	This is an attempt to put shackles on us again.

	"Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!"
	We must peel off his disguise.

	Expose, accuse, criticize,
	Everyone's heart burns with the fire of hatred.

	Completely bury the bourgeois educational line,
	The wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is like the Yellow River...

    生动的一课
    时学东
    放开歌喉唱赞歌，
    扬起铁臂敲金锣。
    工人阶级必须领导一切，
    大伙儿喜气洋洋来庆贺。
    六十多岁的张师傅，
    喜得皱纹起漩窝。
    扛起大旗迈健步，
    落牙的嘴呀笑呵呵！
    “来！年青的同学们！
    大老粗给你们上一课……”
    张师傅打开衣襟敞前胸，
    鞭抽的伤痕一尺多……
    什么是压迫、剥削，
    什么是苦难、饥饿……
    张师傅讲得文通理通有脉络，
    多么生动的一堂政治课！
    谁说“剥削有功”？！
    这是妄图再给我们套枷锁。
    “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    我们要把他的画皮剥。
    大揭发、大控诉、大批判，
    人人心中烧燃仇恨的烈火。
    把资产阶级教育路线彻底埋葬，
    斗批改的浪潮势如黄河……
