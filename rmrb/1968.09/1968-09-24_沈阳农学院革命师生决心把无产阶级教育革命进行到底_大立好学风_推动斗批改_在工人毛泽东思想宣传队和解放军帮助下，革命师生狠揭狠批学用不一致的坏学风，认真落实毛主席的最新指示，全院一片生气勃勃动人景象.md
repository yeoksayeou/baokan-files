The revolutionary teachers and students of Shenyang Agricultural College, under the guidance of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the People's Liberation Army, are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. They are working to establish a good academic atmosphere and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation. With the help of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary teachers and students are vigorously exposing and criticizing the bad academic atmosphere of inconsistency between learning and practice. They are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the entire college is full of vibrant and inspiring scenes.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the PLA comrades stationed at Shenyang Agricultural College, in the new situation where the entire country is red and the struggle, criticism, and transformation phase has begun, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the issue of academic atmosphere is a very important issue, the first important issue." They have targeted the bad academic atmosphere of inconsistency between learning and practice among some teachers and students in the college, who have been influenced by anarchist trends and the reactionary "multi-center theory." They have fully mobilized the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to list the harms of the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere, to dig out the roots of the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere, and to fully recognize the reactionary nature of the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere. This has effectively promoted the revolutionization of thought, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the unit.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the PLA comrades stationed at Shenyang Agricultural College, in the course of leading the college's struggle, criticism, and transformation and realizing the proletarian educational revolution, discovered that some teachers and students, due to being deeply influenced by anarchist trends and the reactionary "multi-center theory," have serious issues of inconsistency between learning and practice in their study of Chairman Mao's works and a series of latest instructions. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the PLA comrades believe that this bad academic atmosphere interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and is the biggest obstacle to deepening the struggle, criticism, and transformation and carrying out the educational revolution. Therefore, they immediately helped the revolutionary committee organize broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes and carry out a rectification of the academic atmosphere.

In the study classes, everyone first studied Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary academic atmosphere: "The issue of academic atmosphere is an issue of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is an issue of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is an issue of the work attitude of all comrades in the Party. Since this is the case, the issue of academic atmosphere is a very important issue, the first important issue." "Our comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism not for show, nor because it has some mystery, but because it is the science that leads the proletarian revolutionary cause to victory." Then, the workers' propaganda team and the PLA comrades inspired the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to review the more than two years of struggle practice during the Cultural Revolution, further deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions.

Through reviewing more than two years of revolutionary history, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff deeply felt that every time the revolution reached a critical moment, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who timely pointed out the direction for us, guiding us from victory to victory. Regarding Chairman Mao's works and a series of latest instructions, whether to learn and apply them or to separate learning from practice, this is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and it is also the key to whether the entire college can achieve victory in the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff had a further understanding of the great significance of carrying forward the revolutionary academic atmosphere, the workers' propaganda team and the PLA comrades, in the study classes, fully mobilized the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a powerful revolutionary criticism movement against the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff closely linked the bitter lessons of the past, where they were harmed by the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere, affecting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and listed ten major crimes of the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere. They unanimously pointed out that the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere is a reactionary bourgeois worldview, a corrosive agent for the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and a major enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many revolutionary teachers and students said: "If the academic atmosphere is not correct, following Chairman Mao is fake, and loyalty to Chairman Mao is empty."

After raising their awareness, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, using Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as a mirror, examined their own thoughts and work, touched their souls, fought their selfishness, and eliminated the poison of the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere in their minds. They held the red book, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and pledged to Chairman Mao: "We will definitely carry forward the revolutionary good academic atmosphere advocated by you, and become thorough revolutionaries." The mass movement to establish Chairman Mao's advocated revolutionary good academic atmosphere quickly unfolded, and the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff excitedly said: "Now, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we feel especially intimate and warm."

Chairman Mao said: "Regarding the theory of Marxism-Leninism, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." The workers' propaganda team and the PLA comrades, in the process of helping the broad revolutionary teachers and students to smash the bourgeois bad academic atmosphere and establish Chairman Mao's advocated revolutionary good academic atmosphere, especially paid attention to carrying forward the excellent style of the working class, who learn and immediately apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and resolutely carry them out. Every time Chairman Mao issued a new instruction, the workers' propaganda team and the PLA comrades resolutely ensured that propaganda did not delay, transmission did not miss anyone, following did not fall behind, and execution did not deviate.

The exemplary actions of the workers' propaganda team and the PLA comrades greatly educated and inspired the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They took the workers' propaganda team and the PLA as examples, learning and applying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff cared about national affairs and actively participated in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," and in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism, combining it with the cleansing of class ranks, exposing a batch of deeply hidden spies, traitors, and remnants of the Kuomintang. They also combined the criticism of the revisionist educational line with the criticism of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and began to eliminate their poison. After the proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, issued the battle order to face the countryside, factories, grassroots, and borders, the 1966 graduates immediately held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fought selfishness and criticized revisionism, and rushed to the borders of the motherland. The 1967 graduates followed Chairman Mao's words and resolutely took the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, all happily rushing to military reclamation farms. Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals, and the entire college's revolutionary teachers and students responded immediately. Revolutionary teachers and students, under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the revolutionary committee, carried their backpacks and walked over 400 miles to the countryside, voluntarily accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

At present, Shenyang Agricultural College is full of vibrant and inspiring scenes. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the working class, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    沈阳农学院革命师生决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    大立好学风　推动斗批改
    在工人毛泽东思想宣传队和解放军帮助下，革命师生狠揭狠批学用不一致的坏学风，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，全院一片生气勃勃动人景象
    本报讯　驻沈阳农学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队和解放军同志，在全国山河一片红，进入斗批改阶段的新形势下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题”的教导，针对本院有些师生在学习毛泽东思想，执行毛主席最新指示时出现的学用分家、言行不一致的资产阶级坏学风，充分发动广大革命师生员工，以毛泽东思想为武器，大列资产阶级坏学风的危害，大挖资产阶级坏学风的根源，充分认清了资产阶级坏学风的反动本质，有力地促进了思想革命化，认真落实了毛主席的最新指示，推动了本单位的斗、批、改。
    进驻沈阳农学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队和解放军同志，在领导这个学院的斗、批、改，实现无产阶级教育革命的斗争实践中，发现有些师生由于受无政府主义思潮和反动的“多中心论”的影响较深，在学习毛主席著作和一系列最新指示中，存在着严重的学用脱节、言行不一的资产阶级坏学风。工人毛泽东思想宣传队和解放军同志认为：这种坏学风，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，是当前深入开展斗、批、改，搞好教育革命的最大阻力。于是，他们立即帮助院革委会组织广大革命师生员工举办毛泽东思想学习班，进行了一次学风整顿。
    在学习班里，大家首先学习了毛主席有关革命学风的教导：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”“我们的同志必须明白，我们学马克思列宁主义不是为着好看，也不是因为它有什么神秘，只是因为它是领导无产阶级革命事业走向胜利的科学。”接着，工人宣传队和解放军同志启发革命师生员工回顾文化大革命两年多来的斗争实践，进一步加深对毛主席指示的理解。
    通过回顾两年多的革命历程，广大革命师生员工深切地感到，每当革命的紧要关头，总是伟大领袖毛主席及时地给我们指明了前进方向，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。对毛主席著作和一系列最新指示，是学了就用，坚决执行，还是学用分家，这是对毛主席忠不忠的重大问题，也是能不能取得全院斗、批、改胜利的关键。
    在广大革命师生员工对发扬革命学风的伟大意义有了进一步认识以后，工人宣传队和解放军同志，在学习班里充分发动群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，对资产阶级坏学风展开了一场声势浩大的革命大批判运动。广大革命师生员工紧密联系以前由于受资产阶级坏学风的毒害，影响了毛主席最新指示贯彻落实的沉痛教训，给资产阶级坏学风列了十大罪状。他们一致指出：资产阶级坏学风是一种反动的资产阶级世界观，是革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上团结的腐蚀剂，是贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大敌。许多革命师生都说：“学风不正，紧跟毛主席就是假的，忠于毛主席就是空的。”
    认识提高后，广大革命师生员工以毛主席一系列最新指示为镜子，对照检查自己的思想和工作，触灵魂，斗私心，肃清资产阶级坏学风在头脑里的流毒。他们手捧红色宝书，站在毛主席像前，向毛主席表忠心：“坚决发扬您老人家倡导的革命好学风，做完全彻底的革命派。”群众性的大立毛主席倡导的革命好学风运动迅速开展起来，广大革命师生员工无比兴奋地说：“现在学习毛主席的最新指示，我们感到格外亲切，格外温暖。”
    毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”工人宣传队和解放军同志在帮助广大革命师生大破资产阶级坏学风，大立毛主席倡导的革命好学风的过程中，特别注意发扬工人阶级对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，坚决照办的优良作风，用执行毛主席革命路线的模范行动教育师生。每当毛主席发出一个最新指示，工人宣传队和解放军同志都坚决做到：宣传不过夜，传达不漏人，紧跟不掉队，执行不走样。
    工人宣传队和解放军同志这种模范行动，极大地教育和鼓舞了广大革命师生，他们以工人宣传队和解放军为榜样，学了就用，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。广大革命师生员工关心国家大事，积极投身到斗、批、改的高潮之中。他们遵照毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，在斗、批、改高潮中狠抓革命大批判，把大批判和清理阶级队伍相结合，揪出了一批隐藏得很深的特务、叛徒、国民党的残渣余孽。他们还把批判修正主义教育路线同批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”结合起来，并开始肃清其流毒。当以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部向知识青年发出面向农村，面向工矿，面向基层，面向边疆的战斗号令以后，一九六六年毕业生立即举办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，奔赴祖国边疆。一九六七年毕业生听毛主席的话，坚决走上了同工农兵相结合的道路，全部愉快地奔赴军垦农场。最近，伟大领袖毛主席发出了关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示，全院广大革命师生闻风而动。革命师生在工人毛泽东思想宣传队和院革委会的领导下，背起背包，徒步四百多里奔赴农村，自觉地接受贫下中农的再教育。
    目前，沈阳农学院一片生气勃勃的动人景象。广大革命师生员工表示，一定要在工人阶级的领导下，搞好学校的斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
