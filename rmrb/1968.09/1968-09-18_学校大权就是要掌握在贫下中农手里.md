In recent days, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaosong Production Brigade, Gaohuo Commune, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, have been enthusiastically celebrating Chairman Mao's latest directive. Everyone says that Chairman Mao's latest directive on the proletarian educational revolution fundamentally changes the revisionist educational system and shatters the illusions of China's Khrushchev, who attempted to restore capitalism. The era of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools is gone forever.

Xiaosong Production Brigade has a primary school, which for many years has implemented the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. The school educates students without regard for proletarian politics, focusing only on academic performance. As long as a student is deemed to have good grades and high test scores, they are considered a good student with a promising future. Over the years, this school has sent very few students from poor and lower-middle peasant families to middle school. Of the 17 middle school graduates who have returned to the village, only five are from poor and lower-middle peasant families. Of the two students currently in middle school, neither is from a poor and lower-middle peasant family. The poor and lower-middle peasants are very dissatisfied with this situation.

How does this school treat students from poor and lower-middle peasant families? Xiaosong Production Brigade is an advanced unit in Changzhi County, with rapid development in collective agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. During peak agricultural seasons, poor and lower-middle peasants send their children to the fields to help, cultivating their children's work ethic and increasing collective wealth. However, this correct practice does not receive support from some teachers at the school. They consider this truancy and use it as an excuse to reprimand students and make various difficulties for them in their studies. Old peasant Li Youcheng's son, Li Renlin, participated more in collective production and neglected his studies, failing to get into middle school. Li Youcheng thought his son was still young and wanted him to study for another year in primary school. A teacher refused, citing a lack of seats. After Li Youcheng's repeated requests, the teacher reluctantly agreed but did not arrange a seat, making Li Renlin stand at the door to listen to the lessons. Later, Li Renlin brought a stool from home, but the teachers found it unacceptable, throwing it around until it was broken in a few days.

Such a school and such an educational system have long been targets of reform by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's latest directive, "In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," truly speaks to our hearts. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully say, "Chairman Mao thinks of everything for us poor and lower-middle peasants. With Chairman Mao leading us, we are truly blessed."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaosong Production Brigade are currently taking steps to manage the school. Everyone is full of confidence, saying, "With Chairman Mao supporting us, we will definitely manage the school well."

### 学校大权就是要掌握在贫下中农手里

    学校大权就是要掌握在贫下中农手里
    近几天，山西长治县高河公社小宋大队的贫下中农，都在热烈欢呼毛主席的最新指示。大家说，毛主席他老人家关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，从根本上改变了修正主义教育制度，打破了中国赫鲁晓夫企图复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的时代，一去不复返了。
    小宋大队有一所小学，多年来也是贯彻了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线。学校培养学生，不问无产阶级政治，只看学习成绩。只要所谓学习好，考试分数多，就是好学生，就有培养前途。几年来，这所学校向初中输送的学生，出身贫下中农家庭的很少。现在回村的十七个初中毕业生，贫下中农子女只有五个。在初中学习的两个学生，都不是贫下中农的子女。贫下中农对这一点是非常不满意的。
    这所学校是怎样对待贫下中农学生的呢？小宋大队是长治县的一个先进单位，农林牧副集体经济发展很快。每当田间生产紧张季节，贫下中农就让子女下田帮忙，既培养了孩子们的劳动观念，又为集体增加了财富。但是这种正确作法，却得不到学校某些教师的支持。他们把这说成是旷课，并以此为理由，责备学生，在学习上加以种种刁难。老贫农李有成的儿子李仁林，参加集体生产比较多，放松了学习，没考上中学。李有成觉得儿子年龄还小，想让孩子再在小学补习一年。有个教师，就是不同意，借口没有座位，拒绝了。后来，经过李有成的多次要求，才勉强答应了，但是又不给安排座位，让李仁林站在门口听课。后来，李仁林自己从家里带了个凳子，他们看着也不顺眼，今天给扔在这里，明天给扔在那里，没几天就把凳子摔坏了。
    这样的学校，这样的教育制度，贫下中农早就有改革的要求。毛主席的最新指示“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”真是说在了我们贫下中农的心坎上。贫下中农高兴地说：“毛主席什么事情都给咱贫下中农想到了，有毛主席领导，我们真是天大幸福。”
    小宋大队的贫下中农，目前已着手管理学校。大家满怀信心地说：“有毛主席他老人家给咱撑腰，我们一定要把学校管理好。”
