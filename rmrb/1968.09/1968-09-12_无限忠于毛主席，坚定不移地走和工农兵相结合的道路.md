Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary young intellectuals firmly walk the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They continuously struggle against the bourgeois ideology in their minds, changing their standpoints, views, and emotions, transforming Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, and forging a heart that is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Wang Songshan, a technician from a certain research institute under the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, is one such revolutionary young intellectual. He uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide his actions, takes "Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto, strictly demands of himself, and firmly walks the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. He seriously transforms his worldview and grasps the revolutionization of his thoughts. In the company, he takes soldiers as his examples and actively studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought; on the construction site, he takes workers as his teachers, learning their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, their selfless and public-spirited proletarian virtues; in the stormy waves of class struggle, he holds a heart of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, stands firm, and bravely defends Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; when he was severely injured in the line of duty and his life was in danger, he always thought of Chairman Mao, with his heart turned towards Chairman Mao.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, consciously walking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers

Wang Songshan's heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao was forged in the process of following Chairman Mao's instructions and consciously walking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, learning from them.

In September 1964, Wang Songshan graduated from university and enlisted in the army amid the nationwide tide of learning from the People's Liberation Army. Soon after, he was sent to a company for training.

Before going to the company, Wang Songshan, with the question of how to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers in mind, seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant works. Chairman Mao taught, "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing. The final division between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to combine with workers and peasants." Wang Songshan realized that this was Chairman Mao's greatest expectation for young intellectuals. He made up his mind: to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly walk the bright path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Upon arriving at the company, the first thing Wang Songshan encountered was the leadership giving him revolutionary books and introducing the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; the first class meeting he participated in was studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune"; the first words the platoon leader spoke were, "We all come from different places, but we have gathered here for a common revolutionary goal." The deep class affection, the tight-knit and combative life, especially the cadres and soldiers' profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, the thick political atmosphere of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, all deeply infected Wang Songshan. He expressed to the soldiers, "I must be like you, firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, definitely master Mao Zedong Thought, take studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the first need in life, make my thoughts, words, and actions completely consistent, act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform my worldview."

In the company, Wang Songshan felt that his thoughts were somewhat at odds with the soldiers'. What was the reason? He realized that although he had grown up with his mother, who had been a textile worker for over thirty years, he had been influenced by the bourgeois educational line in school, and his worldview had not been thoroughly transformed. As the great teacher Chairman Mao said, "To make friends with workers and peasants is not an easy thing." "You want the masses to understand you, you want to blend in with the masses, you must make up your mind, go through long-term and even painful tempering." He realized that young intellectuals must make up their minds, firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and truly blend in with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

To better temper himself, Wang Songshan voluntarily took on the task of raising pigs. Once, while cleaning the pigpen, the soldier in charge of raising pigs rolled up his pants and went into the pen barefoot to clean. Wang Songshan also went into the pen barefoot, but as soon as his foot touched the pig dung and urine, he immediately pulled back, especially when the pig dung and urine splashed onto his body and face, he felt uncomfortable. At this moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's instructions, "Compare the untransformed intellectuals with workers and peasants, and you will find that intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are still workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. This is called a change in feelings, from one class to another." Wang Songshan realized that he had the airs of an intellectual and had a gap with workers and peasants. This gap was a gap in feelings and standpoints. To blend in with workers and peasants, he must, through labor, establish feelings with them and narrow this gap. Thus, he, like the soldier, stepped on the pig dung and picked up the broom to start working.

One night, a sudden strong wind woke Wang Songshan. He immediately ran to the pigpen to check on the pregnant sow. As he approached the pen, he saw a quilt hanging on the pen. It turned out that the soldier had taken his own quilt to block the wind for the sow. This soldier was an active learner and applier of Chairman Mao's works. His spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people deeply educated Wang Songshan. From then on, he learned from this soldier in everything, striving to transform himself. Once, two piglets fell ill. Wang Songshan, learning from this soldier's spirit, ran for four or five miles to buy a thermometer with his own money, frequently measured the pigs' temperature, observed the changes in their condition, and took care of them day and night. Doing so, he gradually felt that his feelings were getting closer to the soldiers', and on the fundamental issue of serving the people, he began to have common language with the soldiers.

One night, Wang Songshan and a soldier were on duty when they suddenly heard a cry for help. Someone had fallen into the pond. The soldier shouted, "Save the person!" and ran towards the pond. Wang Songshan also rushed over. At this moment, Wang Songshan had a thought: he didn't know how deep the pond was, his swimming skills were not good, and it was dangerous to save someone at night. What if...? As soon as the "self" showed its head, his actions became sluggish. But he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Our army is completely for the people. It is thoroughly for the people's interests." He raised his courage, added strength, sped up, and jumped into the pond ahead of the soldier, saving the drowning woman together with the soldier.

Wang Songshan struggled against the "self," did a beneficial thing for the people, but he felt that compared to the soldier, there was still a big gap. He said: We young intellectuals read a lot and talk well, often theory is not linked to practice, and the key is tested at critical moments. When saving the drowning woman, the soldier had "public" in mind and bravely moved forward; I, however, was hesitant and wavered. Chairman Mao said, "Intellectuals, before they blend in with the masses' revolutionary struggle, before they make up their minds to serve the masses' interests and blend in with the masses, often have subjective and individualistic tendencies. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." The "self" that flashed through my mind when saving the person is exactly what Chairman Mao criticized as the wavering nature of intellectuals.

Wang Songshan thus strictly demanded of himself, putting his loyalty to Chairman Mao into his actions, tempering himself bit by bit, learning from the soldiers earnestly and realistically, transforming his thoughts, and striving to climb the peak of "public." Every morning, he carried water for the soldiers to wash their faces, and in the evening, he carried manure, accumulated fertilizer, and planted vegetables. After a day's labor, he insisted on studying "Three Constantly Read Articles," reflecting on his own thoughts, reporting to Chairman Mao the situation of his thought transformation, and in half a year of training in the company, Wang Songshan was rated as a five-good soldier and was selected as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the company.

From more than half a year of company life, Wang Songshan deeply felt that by comparing himself with the soldiers, the many weaknesses of intellectuals whose worldviews had not been transformed were all exposed, enabling him to correctly estimate himself and clearly realize: Intellectuals must grasp Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job of thought revolutionization, and only firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly go to workers, peasants, and soldiers, blend in with them, learn from them, go through long-term and arduous tempering, and truly move their standpoints and feelings to the proletarian side.

Wang Songshan returned to his scientific research post with a firm resolve to continue combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. He worked with workers, still treating himself as a student of the workers, treating the entire process of work as a process of learning from workers, blending in with them, and continuously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his worldview.

Wang Songshan was thus firm in following Chairman Mao's instructions to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, taking "Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto, taking Lei Feng and other heroes as his examples, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, struggling against the "self" at every turn, consciously transforming his worldview. In recent years, he always thought of others and the collective, doing many beneficial things for the people, and was praised as a "Lei Feng-style good youth."

Loyal to Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide one's thoughts and actions

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wang Songshan closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Khrushchev, and bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He took studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as his sacred duty and glorious combat mission.

Last April, Wang Songshan actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war," full of fighting spirit, went to a certain construction site to work. Wang Songshan took on the task of blasting. Wherever the work was heavy, he appeared; wherever there was danger, he fought. One day, he and an old worker were blasting, and five charges were set off, but only four went off, one did not. The old worker said, "Songshan, I'll go and have a look." He finished speaking and was about to leave. At this moment, Wang Songshan thought: removing a misfire is a dangerous job. Before this, there had been misfires, and it was always the worker comrades who bravely stepped forward to remove them. The worker comrades' spirit of selflessness, putting others first, and taking on heavy tasks educated and inspired Wang Songshan. He firmly said, "I'll go and have a look!" He said and rushed up, successfully completing the task of removing the misfire.

On the last day of Wang Songshan's work, a certain project still had two blasting tasks left unfinished. They decided to complete all the blasting tasks to quickly clear the road drainage ditch to prevent the rain from washing away the road, and to prevent the next batch of comrades coming to work from encountering danger due to unfamiliarity with blasting. Before blasting, Wang Songshan was handling a kind of explosive. He saw someone coming and thought: if an explosion occurs, the comrades' lives will be in danger. He followed Chairman Mao's instruction, "Care for others more than for oneself," immediately told the comrades around him, "You all stay away from me!" Just as these comrades had just moved away a dozen steps, a loud explosion occurred. The shockwave, debris, and soil rushed towards Wang Songshan. He was seriously injured and fell to the ground. The comrade closest to him quickly ran over and hugged him, anxiously calling, "Wang Songshan! Wang Songshan!" He trembled slightly and uttered a weak voice, "Have the other comrades been injured?"

"No!"

"That's good!"

A truck loaded with Wang Songshan rushed towards the hospital. The bumps of the car aggravated the pain, and Wang Songshan silently recited Chairman Mao's great instruction, "Be determined, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," to encourage himself and overcome the pain.

After the surgery, Wang Songshan lay quietly on the bed, his lips slightly moving. The comrade taking care of him put his ear close to Wang Songshan's mouth and heard him ask softly, "Do you have 'Three Constantly Read Articles' with you? Read 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' to me." The comrade taking care of him read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with tears. Wang Songshan said, "When I took on the blasting task, I also had the thought of fearing danger, but I thought of the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, 'We die for the people, and it is a worthy death.' I asked myself: Songshan! Songshan! You study 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' every day, and at this critical moment, are you afraid of death? Thus, I took on the blasting task without hesitation."

The twitching of the amputated limb and the pain of the wound became more and more intense, making Wang Songshan unable to sleep for days and nights. The nurse, in order to let him rest a bit, gave him a painkiller. But at this moment, what Wang Songshan needed was not a painkiller, but Mao Zedong Thought. He longed for Chairman Mao so much! But his right eye had been blown out, and his left eye was so swollen that he could not open it, and he could not see Chairman Mao's portrait. He asked the nurse to place a statue of Chairman Mao on his chest and used his right hand, wrapped in bandages, to stroke it. Stroking, stroking, he trembled with his swollen lips and said, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I seem to have seen you, old man!" Wang Songshan felt as if he had come to Chairman Mao's side, feeling incredibly warm, and his whole body was filled with great strength to fight against the pain. In the condition of severe disability, he was even more conscious of using the brilliant thoughts of "Three Constantly Read Articles" to strictly demand of himself. He had only one wish: to be loyal to Chairman Mao and to achieve a spirit that is not disabled even if the body is disabled.

The Party decided to send him to Beijing for treatment to save his left eye. Previously, the Party had sent Wang Songshan to Beijing to complete his university education by Chairman Mao's side; the Party had sent him to the socialist construction posts of the motherland, letting him grow through the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It had been three years since he left Beijing, and today, he was going back to Beijing, back to Chairman Mao's side. His heart was so excited! When the train arrived at Fengtai, Wang Songshan was full of joy, and from the bottom of his heart, he burst out with a sentence, "I'm almost at Chairman Mao's side!"

For more than thirty days of injury, Wang Songshan missed the great commander Chairman Mao the most. Under the Party's care and the careful treatment of the medical staff, Wang Songshan's left eye finally saw the light again. He looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and a red sun rose in his heart, his hot heart beat violently, and tears of happiness flowed down. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who made me see the light again, it is you who gave me a second life! You are my closest relative. Seeing your glorious image is the greatest happiness in my life!" With boundless proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, he used his not yet healed right hand to hold the pen, enduring the pain, and neatly wrote down "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!" twelve big characters.

A few months later, Wang Songshan was able to get out of bed and walk. He eagerly came to Tiananmen Square, happily looking up at the Tiananmen Gate Tower, gazing for a long time at the giant portrait of the great teacher of the proletariat Chairman Mao, gazing for a long time at the place where the great leader Chairman Mao stood to review the cultural revolutionary army, and the warm current of happiness spread throughout his body. A thousand words and ten thousand feelings surged in his heart: Dear Chairman Mao, I will forever be loyal to you! I wish you eternal life!

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," Wang Songshan always and everywhere paid attention to the development of the situation of the Cultural Revolution. During his hospitalization for injuries, he ignored the pain of his wounds, with the help of the comrades taking care of him, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions every day, often discussed issues related to the Cultural Revolution with the comrades taking care of him, and at every moment put himself in the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central China, and East China were issued, Wang Songshan, who was recuperating at home, studied them eagerly. His left eye had poor vision, and after looking at the documents for a long time, his eyes and head hurt. His mother advised him, "Songshan, rest well! After your injuries are healed, you can better work for the Party." Wang Songshan replied, "Without studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, in the complex class struggle, even with healthy eyes, you cannot see the path forward clearly; with Chairman Mao's latest instructions in your mind, a red sun rises, even if you navigate in the vast sea of fog, you will not lose your way."

In recent years, Wang Songshan has taken being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the fundamental direction of his worldview transformation; taken the brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a powerful ideological weapon to establish a proletarian worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people; taken combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the necessary path to achieve thought revolutionization. He strove forward on the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao for revolutionary young intellectuals, climbing the peak of "public."

    无限忠于毛主席，坚定不移地走和工农兵相结合的道路
    ——记国防科委活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某研究所技术员王松山
    在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，革命的知识青年，坚定不移地走和工农兵相结合的道路，不断地斗掉自己头脑里的资产阶级思想，改变着自己的立场、观点和感情，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，锤炼出一颗无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心。
    国防科委某研究所技术员王松山，就是这样的革命知识青年中的一个。他用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动，以“老三篇”为座右铭，严格要求自己，坚定不移地走和工农兵相结合的道路，认真改造世界观，狠抓思想革命化。在连队，他以战士为榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想；在工地，他拜工人为师，学习他们无限忠于毛主席，大公无私、舍己为人的无产阶级崇高品质；在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，他对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，立场坚定，英勇捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；在因公负伤生命垂危时，他时刻想着毛主席，红心向着毛主席。
          遵照毛主席的教导，自觉地走和
      工农兵相结合的道路
    王松山无限忠于毛主席的红心，是在他遵循毛主席的教导，自觉地走和工农兵相结合的道路，向工农兵学习的过程中锤炼出来的。
    一九六四年九月，王松山大学毕业，在全国人民大学解放军的高潮中入伍了，不久，下放到连队当兵锻炼。
    下连前，王松山带着怎样和工农兵相结合的问题，认真学习了毛主席的有关著作。毛主席教导说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”王松山认识到，这是毛主席对知识青年最大的期望。他下定决心：按毛主席的指示办事，坚决走和工农兵相结合的光明大道。
    王松山一到连队，接触到的第一件事，就是领导上发给他革命宝书，向他介绍连队活学活用毛主席著作的情况；参加的第一次班务会，就是学习《为人民服务》；班长发言的第一句话，就是“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”深厚的阶级友爱，团结紧张的战斗生活，特别是干部战士怀着对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想的浓厚的政治空气，使王松山受到强烈的感染。他向战士们表示：我一定要象你们那样，坚决响应林副主席的号召，一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把活学活用毛主席著作，当成生活的第一需要，把心里想的、嘴里讲的、实际做的完全一致起来，按毛泽东思想办事，彻底改造世界观。
    在连队里，王松山觉得自己的思想同战士们总有些格格不入。是什么原因？他意识到自己虽然从小跟随当了三十多年纺织工人的母亲长大，但是在学校里受到资产阶级教育路线的影响，世界观没有彻底改造。正如伟大导师毛主席所说：“和工人农民交朋友，这并不是一件容易的事情。”“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”他体会到，知识青年要做到无限忠于毛主席，就要下定决心，坚决遵循毛主席的教导，真正地和工农兵打成一片。
    王松山为了更好地磨练自己，主动担任了养猪工作。有一次打扫猪圈，负责养猪的那位战士卷起裤腿，光着脚就下到猪圈里打扫起来。王松山也光脚跟着下到猪圈，可是，脚刚落地就踩上猪屎猪尿，马上缩了回来，特别是猪屎猪尿溅到身上和脸上，心里觉得好不是滋味。这时，他想起毛主席的教导：“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。这就叫做感情起了变化，由一个阶级变到另一个阶级。”王松山意识到自己有知识分子的架子，与工农兵有差距。这个差距就是感情、立场的差距。要跟工农兵打成一片，就必须通过劳动，跟工农兵建立感情，缩短这个差距。于是，他也象战士一样，踩着猪屎拿起扫帚就干了起来。
    有一天夜里突然刮起大风，王松山惊醒过来，马上跑到猪圈去看临产的母猪。走近猪圈，看见猪圈挂着一床被子，原来是那位战士怕母猪受凉，把自己的被子拿来挡风了。这位战士是活学活用毛主席著作积极分子，他“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神，使王松山深受教育。从此，他事事处处向这位战士学习，努力改造自己。有一次，有两只小猪生病。王松山学习这位战士的精神，跑了四、五里路，用自己的钱买回体温表，经常测量猪的体温，观察病情变化，废寝忘食地照料。这样做了，他逐渐觉得自己的感情和战士们接近了，在为人民服务这个根本问题上，开始和战士们有了共同的语言。
      有一天夜间，王松山和一位战士正在执行任务，突然传来呼救声，有人掉进池塘了。这个战士说了声：
  “救人！”就向池塘跑去。王松山也跟着急跑。这时，王松山闪过一个念头：不知池塘深浅，自己水性不太好，夜间救人，万一……。“私”字一露头，行动就迟缓。但是，他马上想起毛主席关于“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”教导，就提高了勇气，增添了力量，加快了速度，争先跳进池塘，和战士一起把落水的妇女救上岸来。
      王松山斗倒“私”字，做了一件有益于人民的事，
  但他感到同战士相比还有很大差距。他说：我们知识青年，读书读得多，讲得呱呱叫，往往理论不联系实际，关键时刻就考验出来了。在抢救溺水妇女时，战士“公”字当头，勇敢向前；我却患得患失，犹豫动摇。毛主席说：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”我在救人时一闪而过的“私”字，正是毛主席所批评的知识分子的动摇性。
    王松山就是这样严格要求自己，把对毛主席的忠心，落实到自己的行动中，一点一滴地磨练，扎扎实实地向战士学习，改造思想，努力向“公”字的高峰攀登。他每天早晨为战士们挑洗脸水，晚饭后挑粪、积肥、种菜，星期天主动帮厨。劳动一天，晚上坚持学习“老三篇”，对照自己，向毛主席汇报一天中思想改造的情况，在半年的下连当兵锻炼中，王松山被评为五好战士，并被选为连队学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    王松山从半年多的连队生活中，深深感到，把自己放到战士中间去一比较，世界观没有改造好的知识分子的许多弱点，就都暴露出来了，从而使他能够正确地估计自己，明确地认识到：知识分子要掌握毛泽东思想，搞好思想革命化，只有坚决按照毛主席的教导，全心全意地到工农兵中去，和工农兵结合，向工农兵学习，经过长期的、艰苦的磨练，把自己的立场和思想感情真正移到无产阶级这方面来。
    王松山带着继续和工农兵相结合的坚强决心回到了科研工作岗位。他和工人在一起工作，仍然象在连队当兵一样，把自己当作工人的小学生，把工作的全部过程，当作向工人学习，同工人结合，不断用毛泽东思想改造世界观的过程。
    王松山就是这样，坚定地遵照毛主席的教导和工农兵相结合，以“老三篇”为座右铭，以雷锋等英雄人物为榜样，无限忠于毛主席，狠斗“私”字一闪念，自觉地改造世界观。几年来，他处处想到别人，想到集体，做了许多有益于人民的事情，被誉为“雷锋式的好青年”。
          忠于毛主席，用毛泽东思想统帅
      自己的思想和行动
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，王松山紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，和同志们一起向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派发动猛烈进攻，勇敢捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的革命路线，当作自己崇高的职责，光荣的战斗任务。
    去年四月，王松山积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，满怀战斗豪情，到某工程工地参加劳动。王松山承担了爆破任务。哪里活重，他就在哪里出现；哪里有危险，他就在哪里战斗。有一天，他和一位老工人爆破时，装了五眼炮，只响了四眼，有一炮没响。这位老工人说：
  “松山，我上去看看。”说完就要走。这时王松山想到：排除哑炮是件危险的工作，在这以前也发生过哑炮，都是工人同志挺身而出排除的。工人同志舍己为公、舍己为人、抢挑重担子的崇高精神教育、鼓舞着王松山，他坚定地说：“我上去看看！”说罢就抢先跑了上去，胜利地完成了排除哑炮的任务。
    在王松山参加劳动的最后一天，某项工程还剩下两次爆破任务没有完成。他们为了尽快地把公路排水沟修通，不使雨季到来冲垮公路，又为了不使下批来劳动的同志，由于不熟悉爆破而发生危险，决定全部完成这段爆破任务。爆破前，王松山正在处理一种炸药，看见有同志走过来，他心想：万一发生爆炸，同志们生命有危险。他遵照毛主席“关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导，马上对周围的同志说：“你们离我远点！”不料，就在这几位同志刚走开十几步时，一声巨响，炸药爆炸了。气浪、碎石和泥土扑向王松山。他负了重伤，倒在地上。离他最近的一位同志急忙跑过来将他抱住，焦急地喊：“王松山！王松山！”只见他微微地颤动了一下，嘴里发出微弱的声音：
      “别的同志受伤没有？”
    “没有！”
      “那就好！”
      一辆卡车载着王松山向医院飞奔。车子的颠簸，加剧了伤痛，王松山默念着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导来激励自己，战胜伤痛。
    手术后，王松山静静地躺在病床上，嘴唇微微在动。护理的同志把耳朵贴近王松山的嘴边，只听见他轻微地问道：“你带‘老三篇’没有？给我念一念《为人民服务》。”护理的同志含着热泪念了一遍《为人民服务》。王松山说：“当我担任爆破任务时，也曾闪过怕出危险的思想，可是，我想到伟大领袖毛主席‘我们为人民而死，就是死得其所’的教导，就责问自己：松山呀！松山！天天学习《为人民服务》，在这关键时刻就怕死吗？于是，我就毫不迟疑地承担了爆破任务。”
    断肢的抽搐和伤口的疼痛越来越剧烈，使王松山几天几夜不能入睡。护士为了让他好好休息一会，给他打止痛针。但这时王松山需要的不是止痛针，而是毛泽东思想。他是多么想念毛主席啊！可是，他的右眼已被炸瞎，左眼肿得睁不开，看不见毛主席像。他请护士把一尊毛主席塑像放在他的胸前，用缠满纱布的右手抚摸着。摸着，摸着，他抖动着肿胀的嘴唇说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我好象看到了您老人家！”王松山就象来到了毛主席身边，感到无比的温暖，浑身增添了与伤痛作斗争的巨大力量。他在严重伤残的情况下，更加自觉地用“老三篇”的光辉思想，严格要求自己。他只有一个心愿：忠于毛主席，要做到身残为人民服务的志不残。
    党为了把他的左眼保存下来，决定立即送他去北京治疗。以前，党曾把王松山送到北京，在毛主席身边上完大学；党又把他输送到祖国社会主义建设岗位，让他在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼成长。离开北京三年了，今天，又要回到北京，来到毛主席身边，他的心情是多么激动啊！当火车到达丰台时，王松山满怀喜悦，从内心迸发出一句话：“快到毛主席身边了！”
    负伤三十多天来，王松山最想念的是伟大统帅毛主席。在党的关怀下，经过医务人员的精心治疗，王松山的左眼终于重见光明了。他仰望着墙上的毛主席像，心中升起了红太阳，火热的心激烈地跳动，幸福的泪珠不停地往下流。他激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您使我重见了光明，是您给了我第二次生命！您是我最亲最亲的亲人。看到您老人家的光辉形象，就是我一生最大最大的幸福！”他怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，用还没有痊愈的右手，夹住笔杆，忍着疼痛，端端正正写下了“毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！”十二个大字。
    几个月以后，王松山可以起床行走了，他急切地来到天安门广场，幸福地仰望着天安门城楼，久久地凝视着无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的巨幅画像，久久地凝视着伟大领袖毛主席检阅文化革命大军时站过的地方，幸福的暖流传遍他全身，千言万语涌心头：敬爱的毛主席啊，我要永远忠于您！祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
    遵循毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，王松山时时处处关心文化大革命的形势发展。他负伤住院期间，不顾伤口疼痛，在护理他的同志的帮助下，每天坚持学习毛主席一系列最新指示，经常跟护理他的同志一起讨论有关文化大革命的问题，每时每刻都把自己置身于伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中。
    当毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示下达后，正在家养伤的王松山如饥似渴地学习。他的左眼视力很差，看文件时间长了，眼痛头痛。妈妈劝他说：“松山，好好休息吧！把伤养好了，才能更好地为党工作。”王松山回答说：“不学好毛主席的最新指示，在复杂的阶级斗争中，即使有健康的眼睛，也不能看清楚前进的道路；头脑里有了毛主席的最新指示，心中就升起了红太阳，即使在茫茫的雾海中航行，也不会迷失方向。”
    几年来，王松山把无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为自己世界观改造的根本方向；把光辉的“老三篇”，作为树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的无产阶级世界观的强大思想武器；把和工农兵相结合，作为实现思想革命化的必由之路。他沿着毛主席给革命知识青年指引的光明大道努力前进，攀登“公”字的高峰。
