Such intellectuals, workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome them—recording the doctor Huang Yuxiang of Jiang Town Commune Health Center in Chuansha County, Shanghai

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely stepping into the midst of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, accepting re-education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, washing away the evil influence of the revisionist education system, and forging a red heart to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants—this is Huang Yuxiang, a revolutionary intellectual of the Mao Zedong era, from the Jiang Town Commune Health Center in Chuansha County, Shanghai.

Walking the Path of Unity with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

"Doctor Huang Yuxiang is with us poor and lower-middle peasants, no airs, no fear of hardship, no fear of fatigue, and he is one of us. We poor and lower-middle peasants like such intellectuals, and we welcome more and more such intellectual youth to come to the countryside!" These words were spoken by an old poor peasant, Chen Sima, from the Dagou Production Brigade in Jiang Town Commune. She expressed the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiang Town Commune.

In 1963, Huang Yuxiang, then only twenty years old, graduated from a five-year medical school and returned to Jiang Town Commune. He returned to his hometown, which he had left for five years, and was with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants who had once nurtured him with white rice and coarse grains, and he served them. This should have been a source of pride. However, the influence of the revisionist education system had once made him reluctant to work in the countryside. In the early period, he was in the countryside but his heart was in the city. He secretly planned: stay in the countryside health center for a few years, find an opportunity to fly high, go to a big city hospital, and become a doctor wearing a neat white coat.

So, he sat at the examination table, always distracted. The poor and lower-middle peasants sitting next to him always felt he had a cold and unapproachable face, and they felt he was not one of them.

At night, when someone in a poor and lower-middle peasant's home had an urgent illness and needed a night visit, Huang Yuxiang walked on the uneven paths between the fields, grumbling to the poor and lower-middle peasants who came to call him: "Why didn't you come during the day? Why did you have to wait until night?"

The poor and lower-middle peasants replied: "We also asked him to come during the day, but he just didn't want to come, saying that the production tasks in the fields were tight, and that we should delay it if possible. Who knew that the fever would rise at night."

At that time, Huang Yuxiang could not understand the noble qualities of these poor and lower-middle peasants. He did not feel that serving such poor and lower-middle peasants was his most glorious duty.

In 1964, a great and magnificent movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice swept across the country, both in cities and in the countryside. The vivid deeds of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the commune studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought began to educate Huang Yuxiang. He began to study Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." He saw the great spirit of Zhang Zedong's "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people; he saw the communist ideology of Norman Bethune, who came to China from afar, with his "extreme responsibility to his work" and "extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." In the face of the shining examples personally set by Chairman Mao, he felt ashamed to think of his personal "little calculations." He thought: Chairman Mao nurtured me, the poor and lower-middle peasants raised me, but I was hesitant in serving them. Can this be right? He began to further study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually combine with the workers and peasants."

Chairman Mao's great teachings gave him boundless encouragement and strength.

That year, a massive anti-disease campaign began. Huang Yuxiang became a "team doctor," bravely stepping out of the health center and into the midst of the poor and lower-middle peasants, walking the broad path of combining intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao.

Becoming a Doctor Welcomed by the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

In his interactions with the poor and lower-middle peasants, their clear class stance, deep class feelings, and sky-high revolutionary spirit deeply moved Huang Yuxiang. The poor and lower-middle peasants loved the new society and Chairman Mao. They often held remembrance meetings to recall bitterness and sweetness, using their personal experiences to denounce the evil old society. All of this gave Huang Yuxiang a vivid and profound class education. Once, while treating an old poor peasant woman, this old woman talked about how, in the old society, peasants who fell ill could not afford to see a doctor. Whenever an infectious disease broke out, a large number of people would die, sometimes several people in one family. This old woman also mentioned: in the old society, because her family was poor and could not afford a doctor, one of her children fell seriously ill and died. With tears in her eyes, she said to Huang Yuxiang: "Child, socialism is so good. You doctors often come to the countryside to serve us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is all because Chairman Mao leads us well! If my little one had fallen ill today, he would not have died." The old woman's words were a great encouragement to Huang Yuxiang. Indeed, the poor and lower-middle peasants needed doctors who truly served them so much.

Huang Yuxiang went deep into the countryside. The beds of the poor and lower-middle peasants' homes and the vast fields replaced his white examination table in the health center.

During his days of traveling to provide medical care, he often saw some poor and lower-middle peasants working while sick. This spirit of the working people deeply made him feel that a countryside doctor must step out of the hospital gates, receive re-education among the poor and lower-middle peasants, and serve on the production frontline for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The rain and sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought nurtured the growth of this intellectual who came from an old school, making him begin to walk the path of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

One evening in the summer of 1965, Huang Yuxiang, carrying his medicine box, went to the Xinhua Production Brigade to provide medical care. He heard from the brigade's health worker that a child in the third team of a poor and lower-middle peasant had fallen seriously ill. He immediately rushed there and diagnosed it as epidemic encephalitis B, a very serious condition. He performed some necessary emergency treatments while mobilizing the immediate transfer of the child to the hospital. It was already past seven in the evening, and there was only one bus from Jiang Town to Chuansha. If they walked, it would take more than an hour from the brigade to Jiang Town, and they would definitely miss the bus. What to do? Should they call for an ambulance? That would cost an extra five or six yuan. At this moment, Huang Yuxiang thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and he felt a surge of strength. He resolutely told the adult to hold the sick child on his bicycle. Huang Yuxiang's cycling skills were not very good, and he had never carried anyone on such a difficult road before. However, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and he felt a surge of strength to overcome all obstacles. Along the bumpy road, he finally safely delivered the patient to Jiang Town and caught the last bus.

One evening in early spring of 1966, Huang Yuxiang was on duty in the commune health center's ward. Suddenly, hurried footsteps echoed, and poor and lower-middle peasants from the Chenhu Brigade brought in a critically ill patient—a poor peasant woman in her fifties. At that time, the patient was already unconscious, and the condition was very critical. The patient's family looked at the medical staff with hopeful eyes. Huang Yuxiang organized the rescue while administering a series of emergency medications, and at the same time, he thought about this question in his mind: Should we stay here and rescue? The patient is old and weak, and the condition is serious, which may cause an accident; should we transfer to another hospital? The elderly cannot endure the violent shaking on the car, which may also cause an accident. What to do? At this moment, a great voice was calling him: "Save the dying, practice revolutionary humanitarianism!" He immediately realized: transferring to another hospital may reduce risks, but it is very unfavorable to the patient, which is an irresponsible attitude towards the patient. Difficult work is like a burden in front of us, see if we dare to bear it—Huang Yuxiang resolutely decided to bear this burden. The patient's family also encouraged him on the side: "Doctor Huang, you should be bold and careful, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to defeat this disease, don't be intimidated by it! As long as you do your best, even if you can't cure it, we will not blame you. We absolutely do not agree with the transfer method." The poor and lower-middle peasants' words strengthened his confidence in rescuing on the spot. He immediately strengthened the rescue measures and also called the Chuansha People's Hospital to ask them to send a doctor to assist in the rescue. A doctor with an untransformed worldview coldly replied: "We are busy, you send the patient here." Huang Yuxiang was so angry that his lungs almost burst. However, he still patiently propagated Mao Zedong Thought over the phone, saying: "We are socialist doctors and should follow Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. Norman Bethune came to China from afar, we should learn from him!" Finally, the hospital sent a doctor to assist in the rescue. The patient was unconscious for three days and three nights. Huang Yuxiang forgot to sleep and eat, guarding by the critically ill patient's side, carefully taking care of him, but told the patient's family to rest. A week later, the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital. When leaving, this old poor peasant woman, who had deep bitterness in the old society, tightly held Huang Yuxiang's hand, with tears in her eyes, and said excitedly: "Comrade, thank you for saving my life." Huang Yuxiang replied: "This is what Chairman Mao taught us to do." This old woman looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, becoming even more excited, and said: "We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, always follow Chairman Mao, to the end, without turning back!" She then said: "Comrade, we poor and lower-middle peasants welcome you 'scholars' the most!"

Huang Yuxiang felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants had many respectable and lovable qualities in his interactions with them. He saw that the poor and lower-middle peasants, even in the extremely busy summer and autumn seasons, still studied Chairman Mao's works every day, and he was deeply moved. He himself began to insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. Chairman Mao's teachings gave him a strong political impetus; the poor and lower-middle peasants' extremely responsible and serious spirit towards revolution and production made him better complete his medical and health work. Therefore, every time he went out to treat patients, every time he traveled, and every time he interacted with the poor and lower-middle peasants, he felt it was a great gain. This joyful feeling made him forget the fatigue of working all night and traveling long distances. Over the years, he almost never rested on all holidays and days off. During the summer, when there were many patients, he often slept in the hospital or the brigade's health station. This way, he could go out to treat patients or receive patients coming to the hospital for treatment in a timely manner.

Practicing and Teaching "Barefoot Doctors" in Practice

In 1965, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." The commune set up a "barefoot doctor" training class. Huang Yuxiang heard this good news and was very happy. In his interactions with the poor and lower-middle peasants, he deeply felt that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants needed such a new type of medical and health team so much! However, at that time, the power of medical and health work was in the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders, who promoted "systematization" and "regularization" of revisionist goods. He saw all this, and his heart was both anxious and angry. How could he let the poor and lower-middle peasants' children walk the same old road he had walked a few years ago? How could he let the poison of the revisionist educational line harm them? The poor and lower-middle peasant comrades also raised many opinions. Huang Yuxiang angrily proposed: "Do not let the poor and lower-middle peasants' children be pushed onto the old road, change the training method!" However, a handful of capitalist roaders, relying on the power they had usurped, continued to harm the poor and lower-middle peasants' children.

The great proletarian cultural revolution made the proletarian revolutionaries seize the power of rural medical and health work. Huang Yuxiang took charge of the training work for the second and third batches of "barefoot doctors." He was overjoyed and full of enthusiasm. Based on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings on educational policies, he set up an anti-Japanese military and political university-style "barefoot doctor" training class in two dilapidated thatched houses. From then on, the training class took on a new look. In the morning, there was no more anxious recitation of books, and there was no more dull scene in the classroom where only the teacher lectured and the students took notes. Instead, it was the loud singing of Chairman Mao's quotations, accompanied by the marching steps breaking the sky. The classroom often held meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Learning professional knowledge was done in the way of "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, soldiers teach soldiers." Huang Yuxiang threw himself into this work with all his heart. His home was near the training class, but he brought his quilt to the thatched house and slept with everyone on a pile of rice straw. He felt that being with the poor and lower-middle peasants' children made him sleep well and get along well. He was full of confidence, believing that this would be the only correct way to cultivate rural medical workers. After the training ended, the "barefoot doctors" returned to their production teams, and Huang Yuxiang invested more time in practical teaching work.

A poor peasant member of the Dagou Brigade, Jiang Guilan, was a long-term heart patient who often required the health center doctor to visit. Sometimes she also went to Shanghai hospitals for treatment. Huang Yuxiang decided to go with the brigade's "barefoot doctor" Wang Guizhen to treat this case, letting Wang Guizhen master the technology of treating heart disease in practice, while also reducing Jiang Guilan's economic burden, so that she could receive treatment at home.

The first practical teaching began. Wang Guizhen took the stethoscope to listen, her heart was a bit anxious, and her hands were a bit trembling. Huang Yuxiang encouraged her on the side: "Don't be nervous, listen carefully."

The room was very quiet. Wang Guizhen carefully recorded everything she heard and then carefully wrote a prescription. At this time, Huang Yuxiang took the stethoscope and carefully listened and examined, correcting the deficiencies in her diagnosis and modifying her prescription. Through this practice, Wang Guizhen gained knowledge that she could not get in the classroom. Later, they treated another poor peasant member of the brigade with heart disease. Wang Guizhen made more progress.

One day, a poor peasant member of the brigade came to Wang Guizhen for treatment, saying that she had palpitations and shortness of breath. This time, Wang Guizhen seemed to have more experience. She calmly examined the patient and then checked the patient's feet, finding that the patient's feet were swollen. After asking about other aspects, she finally said with confidence: "You have rheumatic heart disease!"

Her diagnosis was proven correct after examination by the health center doctor.

This is a typical example of learning from practice using the method of "learning war from war." Between Huang Yuxiang and the "barefoot doctors," there are still many similar stories.

The poor and lower-middle peasants saw Huang Yuxiang using this method to teach the "barefoot doctors" in their teams and were all very happy, saying: "This way is correct, studying books is not good!"

Receiving Re-education from the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

However, Huang Yuxiang always felt that the process of teaching was also a process of learning the excellent qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and transforming his worldview. The "barefoot doctors'" unlimited love for Chairman Mao and their deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply educated him. Once, a "barefoot doctor" brought a child to the health center, saying it was epidemic meningitis. Huang Yuxiang habitually put on isolation clothing and a mask and then examined it. However, when he accidentally found that this "barefoot doctor" was neither wearing a mask nor isolation clothing and was tightly holding the child, he felt ashamed. The "barefoot doctors" were like a mirror, making Huang Yuxiang see the weaknesses of intellectuals in himself again. Another time, he went with a "barefoot doctor" to spray medicine to kill mosquitoes. When he walked to the side of a pigsty, a foul smell came towards him, and he pulled back his foot that had stepped out. However, this "barefoot doctor" seemed not to have smelled it and jumped into the pigsty with one leap and started spraying. At this moment, he immediately realized that it was his bourgeois ideology at work and took off his shoes and jumped into the pigsty with her to spray. He felt that only in this way could he truly unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Recently, Huang Yuxiang also studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Students from old schools, most or the majority of them can combine with workers and peasants, some of them even have inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct line leadership, and workers and peasants must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals, workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome them." Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly encouraged him. He said, the party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Looking back on his years of fighting and growing in the countryside, it was completely a process of being nurtured by the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, and it was also completely a process of being re-educated by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Huang Yuxiang also deeply examined himself, saying that over the years, although my ideological transformation has made some progress, it is still far from Chairman Mao's requirements for us. The study and application of Chairman Mao's works are not tight enough, and the vacillation of intellectuals still exists seriously. When encountering difficulties and hardships in work, I often show a hesitant attitude. In the future, I must better unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, throw myself into the three great revolutionary struggles in the countryside, and raise my awareness of line struggle. Only in this way can I better serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的
    ——记上海川沙县江镇公社卫生院医生黄钰祥
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，勇敢地投身到广大的工农兵中间去，接受工农兵的再教育，涤荡罪恶的修正主义教育制度给自己的影响，炼就一颗红心，“完全”、“彻底”地为广大贫下中农服务——上海川沙县江镇公社卫生院的医生黄钰祥，就是这样一位毛泽东时代的革命知识分子。
    踏上了同贫下中农结合的道路
    “黄钰祥医生和我伲贫下中农在一起，一点也没架子，不怕苦，不怕累，和我伲贫下中农是一
  家人，我伲就是中意这样的知识分子，我伲也欢迎更多更多的这样的知识青年到农村中来！”这些
  话，是江镇公社大沟大队的一位老贫农陈四妹讲的。她说出了江镇公社广大贫下中农的心里话。
      一九六三年，才二十岁的黄钰祥读完五年医科学校，回到了江镇公社。他回到阔别五年的家
  乡，和曾经用白面、大米养育了他的广大贫下中农在一起，并且为他们服务，这本来是很值得自豪的。但是，修正主义教育制度的影响，曾经使他一度不安心农村工作。在最初的一个时期中，他身在农村，心在城市，心里暗暗地打算：在农村卫生院待上几年，找个机会远走高飞，到城市大医院里，做个穿着笔挺白大衣的“大夫”。
    于是，他坐在诊疗台旁，总是心不在焉。贫下中农坐在他旁边，总觉得他有副难以亲近的冷面孔，觉得他不是贫下中农的人。
      深夜，贫下中农家里有人生急病，需要夜间出诊，黄钰祥走在一脚高一脚低的田间小路上，对来叫他的贫下中农嘀咕起来：“你们为什么白天不看，硬要拖到夜里？”
      贫下中农回答说：“我伲也叫他白天来的，他就是不愿意来，说是田里生产任务紧，能拖就拖一拖吧。啥人晓得到夜里热度就高起来了。”
      对于贫下中农的这种高贵品质当时的黄钰祥是不能理解的。他并没有感觉到，能为这样的贫下中农看病，是自己最光荣的职责。
    一九六四年，一个伟大的轰轰烈烈的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动的高潮，在全国城市和农村蓬勃地掀起了。公社贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想的生动事迹，开始教育着黄钰祥。他开始学习毛主席《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》这两篇光辉的著作。他看到了张思德同志“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的伟大精神；他看到了白求恩同志“不远万里，来到中国”，“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的共产主义思想。在毛主席亲自树立的光辉榜样的面前，想到自己头脑里个人的“小算盘”，感到羞愧难言。心里想：毛主席培养了我，贫下中农养育了我，我却在为他们的服务中三心两意，这样行吗？他开始进一步学习毛主席的教导：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”
    毛主席的伟大教导，给了他无限的鼓舞和力量。
    这一年，规模巨大的防病工作开始了。黄钰祥当了“包队医生”，勇敢地迈出卫生院大门，深入到贫下中农中去，踏上了毛主席所指引的知识分子与工农兵相结合的广阔道路。
    做贫下中农欢迎的医生
    在同贫下中农的接触中，他们那种鲜明的阶级立场，深厚的阶级感情和冲天的革命干劲，深深地感动着黄钰祥。贫下中农热爱新社会，热爱毛主席。他们经常进行忆苦思甜，用切身的经历来控诉万恶的旧社会。这些，都对黄钰祥上了一堂堂生动深刻的阶级教育课。在一次为一个贫农老妈妈看病的时候，这位老妈妈曾谈起，旧社会中农民生了病，根本请不起医生，每当传染病流行时，总要死去一大批人，有时一家连着死去几个人。这位老妈妈还讲到：在旧社会由于家里穷，请不起医生，她的一个小孩得了重病，丢了生命。她含着眼泪对黄钰祥说：“孩子，社会主义真好，你们医生经常下乡来为我伲贫下中农服务，这都是毛主席领导得好啊！要是我的小囡生病生在今天，就不会死了。”贫下中农语重心长的话，对黄钰祥是个很大的鞭策。是啊！贫下中农多么需要真正为他们服务的医生啊。
    黄钰祥深入到农村来了，贫下中农家的卧床，广阔的田头，代替了他在卫生院的洁白的诊疗台。  
    在他下乡巡回医疗的日子里，经常看到一些贫下中农带病劳动。这种劳动人民的优秀品质，使他深深地感到，一个农村医生，一定要走出医院大门，在贫下中农中接受再教育，在生产第一线为贫下中农服务。
    毛泽东思想的雨露阳光，哺育着这个从旧学校中出来的知识分子的成长，使他开始走上了全心全意为贫下中农服务的道路。
    一九六五年夏季的一个傍晚，黄钰祥挎着药箱到新和大队巡回医疗。听到大队卫生员说，三队一个贫下中农的小孩生了急病，他马上赶到那儿，一诊断确定是流行性乙型脑炎，病势很严重。他一面作了些必要的急救处理，一面动员马上把小孩送医院。这时已是晚上七时多了，江镇到川沙的公共汽车还只有一班，如果步行的话，从大队到江镇要走一个多小时，肯定赶不上了。怎么办呢？叫病家请救护车吗？那要多花五、六元钱。这时，黄钰祥想起了毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，浑身增添了无限的力量，毅然叫大人抱着病孩坐在自己的自行车上。黄钰祥骑自行车的水平并不怎么高，他还从未在这样难走的路上带过人。但是，他想起了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，浑身好象增添了一股战胜一切的力量，沿着崎岖不平的道路，终于安全地把病人送到江镇，赶上了最后一班汽车。
    一九六六年初春的一天傍晚，黄钰祥正在公社卫生院病房中值班。突然一阵急促的脚步声，陈胡大队贫下中农送来一个重危病人——五十多岁的贫农老妈妈。当时，病人已经昏迷不醒，病情非常危急。病人的家属用期待的眼光望着医务人员。黄钰祥一面组织抢救，施用了一系列急救药物，一面在脑子里思考着这样一个问题：留在原地抢救吧，病人年纪老大，体质又很差，而现在病情严重，很可能出事故；转院吧，老年人经不起车上剧烈的震动，更可能出事故。怎么办？这时，一个伟大的声音在向他召唤着：“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”！他马上意识到：转院固然可以少担风险，但是，对病人极为不利，这是对病人的不负责任的表现。艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担——黄钰祥毅然决定挑起这副担子，病人的家属也在旁边鼓励着：“黄医生，你应该胆大心细，要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去战胜这个疾病，不要被它吓倒！只要你尽到自己的一切努力，即使治不好，我们也决不怪你。转院的办法我们绝对不同意。”贫下中农的话，坚定了他就地抢救的信心。他马上加强了急救的措施，并且打电话向川沙人民医院联系，要他们派医生来协助抢救。一个世界观没有改造好的医生接到电话，冷冷地回答：“我们没有空，你们把病人送上来。”黄钰祥肺都气炸了。但是他还是耐心地在电话中向他宣传毛泽东思想，说：“我们是社会主义的医生，要遵照毛主席的教导，为贫下中农服务。白求恩同志不远万里来到中国，我们要向他学习！”最后，医院里终于派了一个医生来协助抢救。病人昏迷了三天三夜。黄钰祥废寝忘食，守候在这个重病人身旁，细心地加以照料，却叫病人家属休息。一个星期以后，病人痊愈出院了。临走时，这位在旧社会里苦大仇深的贫农老妈妈，紧紧地拉着黄钰祥的手，含着满眶热泪，异常激动地说：“同志，谢谢你们救了我的命。”黄钰祥回答：“这是毛主席教我们这样做的。”这位老妈妈抬头仰望墙上的毛主席像，显得更加激动，说：“我伲要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟毛主席走，走到底，不回头！”最后又说：“同志，我伲最欢迎你们这样的‘读书人’！”
    黄钰祥在和贫下中农的接触中，感到贫下中农有许多许多可敬可亲的地方。他看到贫下中农在极为紧张的夏秋农忙季节里，也照常天天活学活用毛主席著作，深受感动，他自己就开始坚持天天学习毛主席著作。毛主席的教导给予他强大的政治动力；贫下中农对革命、生产极端负责认真的精神，使他更好地去完成自己所担负的医疗卫生工作。所以，他每一次出诊，每一次巡回，和贫下中农的每一次接触，都感到是一次很大的收获，这种喜悦的感情，使他忘记通宵工作和长途巡回的疲劳。几年来，所有的节日例假，他几乎很少休息。夏令时期，看病的人多，他就常常睡在医院里或者大队的卫生所里。这样可以及时出诊或及时接待来院治病的人。
    在实践中带教“赤脚医生”
    一九六五年，伟大领袖毛主席发出了
  “把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大号召，公社里办起了“赤脚医生”培训班。黄钰祥听到这个喜讯非常高兴。他在同贫下中农接触的过程中深刻地感到，广大的贫下中农是多么需要有这样一支新型的医疗卫生队伍啊！但是，当时卫生大权掌握在一小撮走资派手里，他们大搞“系统化”、
  “正规化”那一套修正主义货色。他看到这一切，心里又急又恨，怎么能让贫下中农子弟走自己几年前走过的那条道路呢？怎么能让修正主义教育路线的毒素去坑害他们呢？贫下中农同志们也纷纷提出意见。黄钰祥愤怒地提出：“不准把贫下中农子弟推到老路上去，要改变培训方法！”但是一小撮走资派凭借他们手上篡夺的权，继续坑害贫下中农子弟。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使无产阶级革命派夺得了农村医疗卫生大权。黄钰祥担任了第二、三期“赤脚医生”培训工作。他欣喜万分，干劲冲天。他根据毛主席历来有关教育方针的教导，在两间破旧的草房里办起了抗大式的“赤脚医生”培训班。从此，培训班出现了新面貌，早上，听不见忧心忡忡的背书声了，也看不到课堂里只是老师讲、学生记的那种死气沉沉的情景。代替它的是响亮的毛主席语录歌，伴随着出操的步伐声划破长空。课堂上经常举行活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。学习业务知识，是采用“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的方式。黄钰祥以满腔热情投身到这一工作中去了。他家就住在学习班附近，可是他把棉被抱到草房里，和大家一起睡在稻草堆上。他觉得和贫下中农子弟在一起，就睡得香，谈得拢。他充满信心地认为，这将是培养农村医疗工作者的唯一正确的道路。培训结束后，“赤脚医生”回到生产队里去了，黄钰祥以更多的时间投入到实践带教的工作中去。
    大沟大队的贫农社员蒋桂兰，是一个长期患心脏病的人，经常要求卫生院医生出诊，有时她还要到上海医院里去看病。黄钰祥决定和大队“赤脚医生”王桂珍一起去医治这个病例，让王桂珍在实践中掌握治疗心脏病的技术，同时又可减少蒋桂兰的经济负担，使她在家里得到治疗。
    第一次实践带教开始了。王桂珍拿起听诊器听的时候，心有些慌，手有点颤抖，黄钰祥在旁边鼓励她说：“不用紧张，仔细听。”
    屋子里很静，王桂珍用心地把她听到的一切都记下来，然后，她小心翼翼地试开了一张方子。这时，黄钰祥才接过听诊器，细心地听视一番，改正她提出的诊断中的缺点，修改她开的方子。通过这次实践，使王桂珍得到了课堂上得不到的知识。后来，他们又给大队另一位患心脏病的贫农社员看病。王桂珍得到了更多的进步。
    有一天，大队的一个贫农社员来找王桂珍看病，说她心跳、气急。这一次王桂珍似乎有了更多的经验了。她从容地为这个病人听诊，然后又检查病人的脚，发现病人脚肿，又问了其它方面情况后，最后，她满有把握地说：“你生的是风湿性心脏病！”
    她的诊断经过卫生院医生的检查，证明是正确的。
    这是一个采用“从战争学习战争”学习方法的典型例子。在黄钰祥和“赤脚医生”之间，还能举出更多的类似的故事。
    贫下中农们看到黄钰祥用这种方法带教他们队里的“赤脚医生”，都非常高兴地说：
  “这条路子走得对头，死读书就是不好！”
    接受贫下中农再教育
    然而，黄钰祥却总感到，带教的过程，也是他自己学习贫下中农优秀品质，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己世界观的过程。“赤脚医生”对毛主席的无限热爱，对贫下中农的深厚的阶级感情，使他深受教育。有一次，一位“赤脚医生”抱着一个小孩到卫生院来，说是流行性脑膜炎。黄钰祥连忙习惯地穿起隔离服，戴起口罩，再行检查。可是，当他无意中发觉这位“赤脚医生”既不戴口罩，又没穿隔离服，把小孩子紧抱在身边时，他感到脸红了。“赤脚医生”象一面镜子，使黄钰祥又一次看到了自己身上所存在的知识分子的弱点。又有一次，他同一个“赤脚医生”一起去喷药灭蚊。当他走到一个猪棚旁边时，一阵臭味迎面冲来，他把跨出去的脚缩了回来，而这位“赤脚医生”却象没有闻到似的，一个箭步跳到猪棚中，喷了起来。这时，他立即意识到这是自己的资产阶级思想在作怪，便也脱下鞋子，跳到猪棚中和她一起去喷。他觉得，只有这样，才算真正和贫下中农靠拢了。
    最近，黄钰祥又学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的最新指示，给了他极大的鼓舞。他说，天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。回忆自己几年来在农村战斗成长的历程，完全是毛泽东思想的阳光雨露哺育的过程，也完全是广大贫下中农给我再教育的过程。黄钰祥还深刻地检查自己说，几年来，我的思想改造虽然有所进步，但离毛主席对我们的要求还很远很远，活学活用毛主席著作抓得不紧，知识分子的动摇性还相当严重地存在，遇到艰难困苦工作时，常常流露畏缩不前的情绪。今后，一定要更好地与贫下中农打成一片，投身到农村三大革命斗争中去，提高路线斗争觉悟。只有这样，才能更好地为广大贫下中农服务。
