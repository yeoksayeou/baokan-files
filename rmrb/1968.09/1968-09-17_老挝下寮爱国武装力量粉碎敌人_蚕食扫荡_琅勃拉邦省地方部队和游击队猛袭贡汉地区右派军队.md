Patriotic Armed Forces in Southern Laos Smash Enemy's "Gradual Encroachment and Sweeping Operations"
Local Forces and Guerrillas in Louangphrabang Province Launch a Ferocious Attack on Rightist Troops in Kong Han Area

KANGO, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the patriotic armed forces and people in southern Laos in August launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy's "gradual encroachment and sweeping operations," achieving brilliant results.

The broadcast said that in August, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys dispatched multiple battalions of troops to launch a large-scale "gradual encroachment" attack on the liberated areas in southern Laos, brutally killing the local people and committing heinous crimes.

The broadcast said that the patriotic armed forces and people in southern Laos bravely fought back against the invading enemy, annihilating more than 200 enemy soldiers, including 74 killed, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies, causing the enemy's "gradual encroachment and sweeping operations" to suffer a heavy defeat.

According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, on August 30, local forces and guerrillas in Louangphrabang Province launched a fierce attack on a unit of the 15th Battalion of the rightist Laotian army in the Kong Han area along the Nam Ou River. After a few minutes of fighting, the patriotic armed forces killed and wounded nine enemy soldiers, and the remaining enemy troops fled in disarray. The patriotic armed forces also seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment.

On the same night, local forces in the province bravely attacked enemy troops stationed in the Fang An area of Long Ai District, north of Louangphrabang City, killing four enemy soldiers and wounding seven. In the pursuit and annihilation of the fleeing enemy, they captured and forced the surrender of 63 enemy soldiers.

The patriotic armed forces seized 71 weapons and a large amount of military supplies, liberating seven villages in the Fang An area.

Previously, on August 26, the patriotic armed forces annihilated 74 enemy soldiers in the Long Chuk area.
