Japanese revolutionary people warmly hail Chairman Mao's inscription as a historic event of great significance to the Japanese revolutionary movement. They are determined to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the course of struggle. They condemn the Japanese Communist Party's "independent and autonomous" flag, which opposes Marxism-Leninism, denies the principle of violent revolution, and sabotages the Japanese revolution.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 24, Tokyo: Revolutionary people from Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan recently spoke to Chinese reporters, highly praising Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese workers six years ago. They said that it not only pointed out the road to victory for the Japanese revolutionary people but also indicated the direction of victory for the revolutionary people of the world, greatly encouraging the fighting spirit of the working class worldwide.

	A worker from an electric company, Okano, who is currently struggling against the brutal oppression of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, said, "Chairman Mao always has a far-reaching vision and points out the way forward for the revolutionary people of the world." He said, "Japanese revolutionary workers have deeply realized in the course of struggle that only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought can the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people achieve victory. Therefore, Japanese revolutionary people must strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which are universally applicable."

	Telephone operator Tokutomi said, "Japanese postal workers are tenaciously fighting against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese revolution is a component of the world revolution. To achieve victory in the Japanese revolution, we must combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution."

	A trade union worker from Shimoniwa City, Matsumoto, said, "We, the working class, are the leading class of the Japanese revolution. We must widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the workers and insist on applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice."

	A staff member from the progressive newspaper, Tachikawa, emphasized that combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution is an important task for the Japanese revolutionary people.

	Tachikawa strongly condemned the revisionist group led by Miyamoto for spreading the illusion of the "parliamentary road" among the people, suppressing and destroying the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 23, Tokyo: A responsible person from the left-wing of the Japan Democratic Youth League in Yamaguchi Prefecture recently spoke to Chinese reporters, warmly hailing the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao six years ago to Japanese worker friends.

	The chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League (left-wing), Abe Junji, said, "We must arm the revolutionary people with the thought of violent revolution of Marxism-Leninism. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, denied the principle of violent revolution, abolished the dictatorship of the proletariat, and betrayed proletarian internationalism." He said, "The Miyamoto revisionist group has become a mouthpiece for U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government."

	The standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League (left-wing), Fujii Yoshinori, said, "Chairman Mao's inscription is a great call to the working class of Japan and the world, and it is a battle cry for the working class worldwide to achieve victory in the world revolution."

	Fujii condemned the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto for raising the banner of "independent and autonomous," opposing Marxism-Leninism, denying the principle of violent revolution, advocating the bourgeois "parliamentary road," sabotaging the Japanese revolution, and colluding with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Soviet modern revisionism.

	The standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League (left-wing), Ogawa Hiroshi, said, "Japanese Marxist-Leninists must master Mao Zedong Thought, and this will certainly open a new chapter for the Japanese revolution."

	Ogawa highly praised the great leader Chairman Mao's significant contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism. He said, "Chairman Mao not only pointed out the road to victory for the Chinese revolution but also for the revolutions of the world. Ogawa stressed that Japanese revolutionary youth and people must follow Chairman Mao's teaching that 'the central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by force, to solve problems through war,' combine it with the actual situation in Japan, and promote the development of the Japanese revolution.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 23, according to a report by the East Asia News Agency: Japanese workers and students warmly hail the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese worker friends as a historic event of great significance to the Japanese revolutionary movement.

	Progressive friend Nakajima Takashi from Saga Prefecture said: The publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription is a historic event of great significance to the Japanese revolutionary movement. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call and advance with high spirits towards the victory of the Japanese revolution.

	Nakajima Takashi pointed out that U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries have set up many military bases and troops across Japan to suppress the Japanese people. He said, "If we are to adhere to the principle of violent revolution of Marxism-Leninism, solve the strategic and tactical problems of the Japanese revolution based on the specific situation in Japan, we must pay great attention to the broad peasant masses as the most reliable allies of the proletariat, especially the poor peasants who make up the majority of the peasants in rural areas."

	The worker from Kitakyushu City, who stands at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, Ooyama Hideo, said: "Chairman Mao has shown the greatest concern for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people and provided us with the sharpest ideological weapon for class struggle."

	University student Nomura Hiroshi, who insists on the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, said: According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we must continuously strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, actively participate in practical struggles, and combine theory with practice. We must seriously learn to combine Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution in the course of struggle and contribute to the progress of the Japanese revolution. Nomura Hiroshi said: In the high tide of the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle in Japan, we young people and students must strive to raise our political awareness and, following Chairman Mao's teachings, achieve unity with the working and peasant masses.

    日本民主青年同盟（左派）山口县委员会委员长阿部淳二说，我们必须用马克思列宁主义的暴力革命的思想，来武装革命人民。日共宫本修正主义集团背叛马克思列宁主义，否定暴力革命的原则，取消无产阶级专政，背叛无产阶级国际主义。他说，宫本修正主义集团已经成为美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府的应声虫。
    日本民主青年同盟（左派）山口县委常委藤井善典说，毛主席的题词是向日本和世界各国工人阶级发出的伟大号召，是鼓舞全世界工人阶级夺取世界革命胜利的进军号角。

    中岛隆指出，美帝国主义和日本反动派在日本全国各地布置了许多军事基地和军队，用以镇压日本人民。他说：“如果我们要坚持马克思列宁主义暴力革命的原则，从日本的具体情况出发，解决日本革命的战略战术问题，我们必须十分重视作为无产阶级最可靠的同盟军的广大农民群众，特别是在农村中占农民绝大多数的贫农。”
    站在反美斗争前列的北九州市的工人大山秀夫说：“毛主席对日本人民的革命斗争表示了最大的关怀，他给予我们进行阶级斗争以最锐利的思想武器。”
    坚持反美爱国斗争的大学生野村博说：根据毛主席的教导，我们要不断努力学习马克思列宁主义，积极参加实际斗争，要理论联系实际。我们要认真地在斗争中学会把毛泽东思想同日本革命的具体实践结合起来，为日本革命的进展作出贡献。野村博说：在日本反美爱国斗争的高潮中，我们青年和学生必须努力提高政治觉悟，并且要遵照毛主席的教导，实现同工农群众的结合。
