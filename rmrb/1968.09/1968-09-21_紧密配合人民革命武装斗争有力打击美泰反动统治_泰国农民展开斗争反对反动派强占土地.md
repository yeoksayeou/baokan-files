The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on September 18th, discussing the brave struggles of Thai farmers against the U.S.-Thanom clique's seizure of their land.

The article points out that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, by engaging in armed struggle and overthrowing the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique, can Thai farmers truly escape their miserable lives.

The article states that land is the lifeline of farmers. However, under the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique, farmers' land is seized by the U.S.-Thanom clique and landlord tyrants.

In the past four years, the land seized and occupied for the construction of U.S. military bases amounts to over a million rai (each rai is equivalent to 2.4 acres), causing countless farmers to become homeless and destitute.

The article says that reality has educated the farmers, making them realize that the root of their suffering is the oppression, exploitation, and plunder by the U.S.-Thanom clique and landlord tyrants. Therefore, the broad masses of farmers have united to launch struggles to defend their land. From 1967 to the present, tens of thousands of farmers across the country have engaged in various forms of struggle, resisting the U.S.-Thanom clique and landlord tyrants' seizure of land, and opposing the occupation of farmers' land for the construction of U.S. military bases.

The article states that the farmers' struggle to defend their land is closely coordinated with the armed revolutionary struggles of the people in various places, causing the enemy to be extremely panicked.

The article says that the Communist Party of Thailand has shown the Thai people the only correct revolutionary path: "Only by daring to use revolutionary violence to decisively defeat counter-revolutionary violence can we thoroughly eliminate the people's suffering and save the nation." (Thai Communist Party's 24th Anniversary Declaration) Thai farmers can only take up arms to resist the oppression and suppression of the U.S.-Thanom gang of robbers, thoroughly eliminate the enemy, and effectively defend their lives and property.

    紧密配合人民革命武装斗争有力打击美泰反动统治
    泰国农民展开斗争反对反动派强占土地
    新华社二十日讯“泰国人民之声”电台十八日广播一篇文章，评述泰国各地农民反对美国—他侬集团强占农民土地的英勇斗争。
    文章指出，泰国农民只有在泰国共产党领导下，进行武装斗争，推翻美国—他侬集团的反动统治，才能够彻底摆脱苦难的生活。
    文章指出，土地就是农民的生命线，但是，在美国—他侬集团的反动统治下，农民的土地被美国—他侬集团和地主恶霸所强占。
    四年来，被并吞和强占去为美帝修建军事基地的土地面积共达一百多万莱（每莱合二·四亩），无数农民因此而流离失所，家破人亡。
    文章说，现实生活教育了农民，使他们认识到自己苦难的根源，是美国—他侬集团和地主恶霸的压迫、剥削和掠夺。因此，广大农民团结一致，开展保卫土地的斗争。从一九六七年到现在，全国各地已有数以十万计的农民进行了各种形式的斗争，反抗美国—他侬集团和地主恶霸强夺土地，反对霸占农民土地去为美帝修筑军事基地。
    文章说，农民保卫土地的斗争紧密地配合了各地人民的革命武装斗争，使敌人非常恐慌。
    文章说，泰国共产党给泰国人民指明了唯一正确的革命道路：“只有敢于用革命的暴力坚决地去战胜反革命的暴力，才能彻底解除人民的痛苦和拯救国家。”（泰共建党二十四周年文告）泰国农民只有拿起武器反抗美国—他侬强盗集团的压迫镇压，彻底消灭敌人，才能够有效的保卫自己的生命财产。
