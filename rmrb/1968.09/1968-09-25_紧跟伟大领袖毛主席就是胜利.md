Following the Great Leader Chairman Mao is Victory

Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters

	Last year, the great leader Chairman Mao inspected the North China, Central China, and East China regions and issued a series of extremely important and profound instructions to the working class. Chairman Mao said in his latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." It is under the guidance of this wise instruction from Chairman Mao that the Shanghai working class has launched a high tide of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination; subsequently, based on revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and revolutionary criticism, we have carried out the work of cleaning up class ranks and launched a high tide of struggle against the enemy.

	The struggle practice of the past year has shown that all our victories are the great victories of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the great victories of the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin!

	Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's great instructions have pointed out the direction for us to welcome the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation that has arrived, and are our most sharp weapon of thought and most reliable guarantee for achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Currently, the great struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation that we face is essentially a matter of power. The working class must transform culture and all superstructures according to the worldview of the working class; the bourgeoisie also wants to transform culture and all superstructures according to its own worldview. This is another fierce and arduous struggle. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call for the working class to "lead everything" and seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, not only shouldering the great historical mission of carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories and enterprises, but also going to primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, to various fields of the superstructure, and to all units where struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been carried out well, leading and promoting struggle, criticism, and transformation there.

	To carry out the great call to seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must firmly grasp the fundamentals and not deviate. First, we must firmly grasp the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and realize Chairman Mao's latest instruction that the working class "should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." We must use our greatest efforts to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and realize Chairman Mao's wise instruction that the working class "must lead everything." We must firmly grasp class struggle and not deviate, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, seriously clean up class ranks, smash all the tricks and sabotage activities of the class enemy, and ensure that every instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are quickly and fully implemented, truly shouldering the great historical mission of the working class "leading everything."

	To complete the entire task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's great teachings that the proletariat "not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity," and unite all revolutionary forces to jointly fight the enemy. We must persistently consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, not only uniting our own class ranks but also being good at uniting and relying on our most reliable ally—the poor and lower-middle peasants, uniting the urban petty-bourgeoisie, and cherishing the young red guards. We must seriously carry out the various proletarian policies regarding intellectuals stipulated by Chairman Mao, do thorough and detailed ideological and political work, use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate them, unite those who can be reformed among them, organize a vast revolutionary army, and severely strike at a handful of class enemies.

	Struggle, criticism, and transformation is a very arduous and meticulous task. To complete this task and fulfill the great historical mission given to us by Chairman Mao, we must fully mobilize the masses, promote the spirit of investigation and research, make comprehensive plans, summarize experiences, set up models, promote the advanced, grasp the backward, and formulate feasible and targeted measures to ensure that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are truly fully implemented.

	The struggle practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has made us deeply realize that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is an unshakable truth!

	We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, be more modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, advance victoriously, and make new contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    下面是各地工农兵写的热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席视察三大区一周年的文章。
    紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利
    上海工人革命造反总司令部
    伟大领袖毛主席在一年前视察华北、中南和华东地区时，向我们工人阶级发出了一系列极其重要、极其深刻的指示。毛主席在最新指示中说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们上海工人阶级正是在毛主席这一英明指示的指引下，掀起了革命大联合和革命三结合的高潮；接着，又在革命大联合、革命三结合、革命大批判的基础上，开展了清理阶级队伍的工作，掀起了对敌斗争的高潮。
    一年来的斗争实践表明，我们的一切胜利，都是毛主席一系列最新指示的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导的伟大胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的伟大指示，为我们迎接已经到来的伟大的斗、批、改高潮指明了方向，是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最锐利的思想武器和最可靠的保证。
    目前，我们面临的这场斗、批、改的伟大斗争，其本质依然是政权问题。工人阶级要按照工人阶级自己的世界观来改造文化和一切上层建筑；资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造文化和一切上层建筑。这是又一场激烈的艰巨的斗争。我们一定要坚决执行毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”和认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大号召，不但要肩负起搞好工厂企业斗、批、改的伟大历史使命，而且要到大、中、小学去，到上层建筑各个领域中去，到一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位去，领导那里的斗、批、改，促进和搞好那里的斗、批、改。
    要执行认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大号召，必须狠抓根本不转向，首先要狠抓全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，实现毛主席“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的最新指示。我们一定要用最大的力量去宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，实现毛主席的“工人阶级必须领导一切”的英明指示。我们一定要狠抓阶级斗争不转向，深入开展革命大批判，认真清理阶级队伍，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计和破坏活动，保证毛主席的每一个指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都能迅速全面地贯彻执行，真正肩负起“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大历史使命。
    要完成斗、批、改的全部任务，必须不折不扣地执行毛主席关于“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”的伟大教导，团结一切革命力量，共同对敌。我们一定要坚持不懈地巩固和发展革命的大联合，不但要团结好自己的阶级队伍，而且要善于团结和依靠自己最可靠的同盟军——贫下中农，团结城市小资产阶级群众，爱护革命红卫兵小将。我们一定要认真执行毛主席规定的对待知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，做好深入细致的思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想给他们以再教育，团结他们中间有可能改造的人们，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    斗、批、改是一项非常艰巨、非常细致的工作。要做好这项工作，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史任务，就要充分发动群众，大兴调查研究之风，做好全面规划，总结经验，树立典型，发扬先进，狠抓后进，制定切实可行的、有的放矢的措施，保证毛主席的一系列最新指示真正得到全面落实。
    无产阶级文化大革命两年多来的斗争实践，使我们深刻地体会到，毛主席的一系列最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。这是千真万确、颠扑不破的真理！
    我们一定要发扬工人阶级的彻底革命精神，决不辜负毛主席的期望，更加谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利作出新的贡献。
