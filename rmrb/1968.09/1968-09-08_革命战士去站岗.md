The joyous drums beat with hearts bursting with joy, and the songs of victory echo across the nation. The news of "the whole country turning red" has reached the barracks, and revolutionary soldiers, filled with enthusiasm, go on guard duty. With vigorous steps, rifles gleaming on their backs, they bask in the refreshing autumn breeze, and revolutionary passion surges in their hearts. Climbing the green hill, it seems as if they can see the red flags fluttering at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains; crossing the silver river, it feels as if they can hear the joyous songs of the Yarlung Zangbo River....

Looking up at the Big Dipper in the sky, isn't that the bright lights of Zhongnanhai shining all night?! "Password?"—"Cultural Revolution!" "Counter-password?"—"Complete Victory!" Close comrades-in-arms share a great spirit. "Xiao Zhang, hurry back to join the celebration! Shout 'Long live Chairman Mao forever!' for me." "Defending the red revolutionary new regime, we must not be slack or complacent, Xiao Wang! When the revolutionary people are happy, the class enemies grind their teeth in rage." The comrade's reminder, the people's hope, the heavy burden is on our shoulders. With the precious book in hand and the rifle gripped tightly, vigilant eyes watch the front.

    革命战士去站岗
    海军某部　王桂瑶欢乐的锣鼓敲得心花怒放，神州处处凯歌嘹亮，“全国一片红”的喜讯飞进军营，革命战士乘兴去站岗。迈开雄健的步伐，身背乌亮的钢枪，沐浴着清爽的秋风，革命的激情在胸中荡漾。登上绿色的土坡，好象看到天山脚下红旗扬；跨过银色的小河，仿佛听到雅鲁藏布江欢唱。……仰望天上的北斗呵，那不正是中南海彻夜通亮的灯光？！“口令？”——“文革！”“回令？”——“全胜！”亲密的战友豪情壮。“小张，快回去参加庆祝会吧，替我多喊几遍‘祝毛主席万寿无疆！’”“保卫红色的革命新政权，可千万不能松懈麻痹呀，小王！当革命人民高兴的时候，阶级敌人牙齿咬得格格作响。”战友的嘱咐，人民的希望，千斤重担挑在肩上。怀揣宝书握紧枪呀，警惕的眼睛注视着前方。
