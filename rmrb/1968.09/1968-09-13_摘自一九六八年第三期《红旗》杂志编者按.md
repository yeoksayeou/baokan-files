A question is raised here: for the large number of graduates from higher and secondary schools who have already been working and are currently working, attention should be paid to their re-education, so that they can integrate with workers and peasants. Among them, there must be those who have integrated well and made inventions and innovations, and their stories should be reported to encourage others.

    这里提出一个问题，就是对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。其中必有结合得好的并有所发明创造的，应予以报导，以资鼓励。
