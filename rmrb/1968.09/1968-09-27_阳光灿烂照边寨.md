On the banks of the Lancang River in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, live the hardworking and brave Dai and Hani peoples. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every village and hamlet here has become a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, and a battlefield for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought has swept across the entire country, and the red sun has risen over the banks of the Lancang River, never to set.

The Hani Mountains Are Boiling

Not far from the border, there is a Hani village called Dahai. Surrounded by mountains on all sides and in a remote location, this place was tightly sealed off by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan before the Cultural Revolution, and due to poor transportation, the Hani people had long been unable to see Chairman Mao's portrait or hear his voice.

The mighty east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has blown across the country, and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team has come to Dahai, helping the Hani people set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, profoundly changing the spiritual face of the people. The Hani Mountains are boiling!

Look! Under the banana grove, Hani men and women dressed in festive attire are gathering from all corners of the village to the study class to request Chairman Mao's portrait and listen to his teachings. The clanging of gongs and drums grows louder and louder; songs praising Chairman Mao echo one after another in the night sky. The lights are on in the public rooms, and a Hani girl named Dangling is enthusiastically distributing revolutionary books and Chairman Mao's portraits to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Dangling is an active promoter of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the county. With the help of the PLA comrades, she diligently reads Chairman Mao's books and actively propagates Mao Zedong Thought. The masses call her the "Red Propaganda Officer." A few days ago, Dangling heard that the county had received a batch of color portraits of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan." She thought, if we could bring the red sun to the village, letting the Hani people see Chairman Mao's glorious image every day, that would be wonderful! So, she braved the hardships, walked for five days, crossed twelve mountains, and waded through five rivers to buy a large number of color portraits of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," Chairman Mao's works, and Chairman Mao badges in the county. When Dangling returned to the village, although the sun had already set, she, despite her fatigue from the long journey, quickly convened a meeting to distribute the red treasures and Chairman Mao's portraits.

The villagers heard that Dangling had brought the long-awaited red sun for everyone, and they were all overjoyed, rushing to attend the meeting. Seventy-four-year-old poor peasant member Sangnu, upon receiving a color portrait of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!"

Now, the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Dahai is thriving, with everyone reading Chairman Mao's books and presenting a moving scene of criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

The Changes in the Dai Family

The Dai people have a custom where, after marriage, the man moves to the woman's family, known as "marrying in." In Manmengyang Village, poor peasant member Mi Wen's daughter, Yuhanyan, found a partner named Daoguanglin. He comes from a poor background, has good thoughts, and the poor and lower-middle peasants all envy Mi Wen for finding such a good son-in-law.

Who would have thought that soon after Daoguanglin came to the new home, Mi Wen had complaints about her son-in-law. What was the reason? It turned out that after Daoguanglin came to the new home, he often organized the youth to study Chairman Mao's works and was always thinking about the collective. Under his influence, Yuhanyan also ran around for collective matters. Most of the household chores fell on the fifty-something Mi Wen, who had some complaints about her daughter and son-in-law not helping with the household chores.

One day, when her daughter and son-in-law returned from work, Mi Wen had not lit the fire or cooked the sticky rice. She said angrily, "You two are always running to the commune, why don't you just go eat there?" Yuhanyan heard this and criticized her mother for having too much selfishness. This made Mi Wen even angrier.

Last October, under the guidance of the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, a Mao Zedong Thought study class was also set up in Mi Wen's home. The first lesson was to recall bitterness and sweetness, and severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev. Daoguanglin was the first to speak, recounting his own bitter family history. Mi Wen wept uncontrollably as she denounced the old society's tyranny that killed her husband, leaving her to wander with her children, begging for food, and severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "three-self and one-package." Then, the whole family studied the "Three Articles" together. Mi Wen said excitedly, "Chairman Mao wants us to 'completely, thoroughly, and selflessly serve the people,' but I was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev, had too much selfishness, and truly let down our savior Chairman Mao." Hearing her mother's self-criticism, her daughter and son-in-law were very happy, thinking about how they had not helped the elderly enough, and they all made sincere self-criticisms.

The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the entire Mi Wen family. Now, Mi Wen has become a famous "old activist" in the village who is dedicated to public service.

    阳光灿烂照边寨
    云南西双版纳傣族自治州的澜沧江畔，居住着勤劳勇敢的傣族、哈尼族人民。无产阶级文化大革命以来，这里的村村寨寨，到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处摆开了批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。毛泽东思想的春风吹遍了祖国大地，澜沧江畔升起了不落的红太阳。
    哈尼山沸腾了
    在离国境线不远的地方，有个名叫大海寨的哈尼人村寨。这里四面环山，地势偏僻。文化大革命以前，在中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人的严密封锁下，加上交通不便，哈尼族人民长期看不到毛主席像，听不到毛主席的声音。
    无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，吹遍了祖国大地，人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队来到了大海寨，帮助哈尼族人民办起了毛泽东思想学习班，使人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。哈尼山沸腾起来了！
    看！在那芭蕉林下，穿着节日盛装的哈尼族男女社员，从寨子的各个角落赶到学习班来请毛主席像，聆听毛主席的教导。锵锵锣鼓声，一阵高过一阵；颂扬毛主席的革命歌声，一支接一支地在夜空中回荡……。公房里灯火通明，一位哈尼族姑娘当棱，正在热情地向贫下中农赠送革命宝书和毛主席像。
    当棱是县里活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，在解放军同志的帮助下，她刻苦地读毛主席的书，积极宣传毛泽东思想，群众都称她是“红色宣传员”。前几天，当棱听说县上来了一批《毛主席去安源》的彩色画像，她想，要是把红太阳请到寨子里，让哈尼人天天看到毛主席他老人家的光辉形象，那该多好呀！于是，她不辞辛苦，步行五天，翻过十二座高山，涉过五道河，到县城里买了大量的《毛主席去安源》彩色画像和毛主席著作、毛主席像章。当棱赶回寨子时，虽然太阳已经落山了，但她不顾长途跋涉的疲劳，连忙召集了分发红色宝书和毛主席像的大会。
    社员们听说当棱为大家请来了日夜盼望的红太阳，个个喜笑颜开，纷纷赶来参加大会。七十四岁的贫农社员桑诺，得到一张《毛主席去安源》彩色画像时，高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    现在，大海寨的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，人人读毛主席的书，呈现出一片斗私批修的动人景象。
    傣家人的变化
    傣族有个风俗，结婚后男的要搬到女方家去住，叫做“招赘”。曼勐养寨贫农社员咪温的女儿玉罕燕，找了个对象叫刀光林。他出身贫苦，思想好，贫下中农都羡慕地说咪温找了个好女婿。
    谁知，刀光林上门不久，咪温对女婿就有了意见。是啥原因呢？原来，刀光林来到新家以后，经常组织青年学习毛主席著作，一个心眼为集体操心。在他的影响下，玉罕燕也尽为集体的事东转西跑。家里的活大部分都落在五十多岁的咪温的身上，她对女儿和女婿不帮助她做家里的活就有些意见了。
    一天，女儿女婿收工回来，咪温没生火，也没煮糯米饭。她气呼呼地说：“你们光往社里跑，干脆到社里去吃饭吧。”玉罕燕一听这话，便批评阿妈私心太重。可把咪温气坏了。
    去年十月，在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，咪温家里也办起了毛泽东思想学习班。学习班的第一课是忆苦思甜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义黑货。女婿刀光林第一个发言，他讲述了自己苦难的家史。咪温泣不成声地控诉起旧社会土司逼死丈夫，弄得自己拖儿带女到处要饭的悲惨生活，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”“三自一包”等反动谬论。接着，全家人在一块学习了“老三篇”，咪温激动地说：“毛主席他老人家要我们‘毫不利己专门利人’‘完全’‘彻底’‘为人民服务’，我却中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，私心太重，真对不起救命恩人毛主席。”听了阿妈的自我批评，女儿、女婿心里非常高兴，想到自己对老人家帮助不够，也都作了认真的自我批评。
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，照亮了咪温全家。现在，咪温已经是寨子里有名的一心为公的“老积极分子”了。　昆新
