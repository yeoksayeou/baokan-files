Japanese progressive friends continue to celebrate the publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese workers, determined to combine theory with practice, and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to Japanese revolutionary practice to solve actual problems of the revolution.

The Japanese Haishinsha Theater troupe's artists held a discussion on September 20, pointing out that the important inscription written by the great leader Chairman Mao six years ago to Japanese workers is a universal truth applicable everywhere, and it points the way for revolutionary people all over the world.

Fujii Yoshiaki said at the discussion: Chairman Mao's important inscription points out the path for all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world.

Fujii said, Japanese revolutionary artists, following Chairman Mao's teachings that "revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people," will propagate the idea of violent revolution, i.e., armed seizure of political power, to the Japanese people.

Watanabe Minami said: We are currently rehearsing a play about Japanese workers studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out workers' movements. In this work, we will highlight the great ideas proposed by Chairman Mao in the inscription.

Takeuchi Yone said, we who engage in revolutionary art have the responsibility to quickly propagate Chairman Mao's important inscription to the Japanese people through artistic forms. Especially for us artists who were received by Chairman Mao during our visit to China last year, we have an even greater responsibility to propagate this important inscription by Chairman Mao.

Representative Matsui Shiro of the Hyogo Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party said in celebrating the publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese workers: Combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution is the most fundamental principle that all Japanese revolutionaries must adhere to, and it is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

Matsui said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." The leading class and main force of the Japanese revolution are the working class. The Japanese working class must, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen and develop its revolutionary ranks in the struggle to accomplish the great historical mission of the Japanese revolution.

Representative Yamada Toshio of the Osaka Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party said: We believe that now, more than ever, we should seriously study the brilliant inscription of Comrade Mao Zedong. Yamada pointed out: Today, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people is heading towards a new high tide. He said, when we study Chairman Mao's works, we especially emphasize the combination of theory and practice to solve actual problems with Mao Zedong Thought.

The director of the "Mao Zedong Thought Institute" Otsuka Yuzuo said, the publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese workers six years ago has greatly encouraged us.

He pointed out: The revisionist traitor group of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Miyamoto, under the pretext of so-called "different domestic and international conditions," deliberately distorts the most fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, opposes the armed seizure of political power, advocates "peaceful revolution," and advocates the so-called "independent and autonomous" line, which is the most shameful traitorous behavior.

Japanese revolutionary youth held a political study meeting in Tokyo on September 24, seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription to Japanese workers, and celebrating the fact that all of China (except Taiwan Province) has turned red.

    日本革命人士强调毛主席题词为革命人民指明了方向
    马列主义同革命实践相结合无往不胜
    齿轮座朋友决心用文艺形式宣传毛主席题词推进日本人民斗争
    本报综合报道：据新华社消息，日本进步朋友继续欢呼毛主席书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表，决心要使理论与实践相结合，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想运用到日本革命实践中去，解决革命的实际问题。
    日本齿轮座剧团的文艺工作者二十日举行的座谈会指出，伟大领袖毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，它为全世界革命人民指出了方向。
    藤井义昭在座谈会上说：毛主席的重要题词，给全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民指出了应走的道路。
    藤井说，日本革命的文艺工作者遵循毛主席关于“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器”的教导，向日本人民宣传暴力革命即武装夺取政权的思想。
    绵津蕗说：我们现在正在排练日本工人阶级活学活用毛泽东思想、开展工人运动的戏剧，我们将在这个工作中，突出毛主席在题词中提出的伟大思想。
    武井米实说，我们从事革命文艺工作的人，有责任尽快地通过艺术形式，广泛地向日本人民宣传毛主席的重要题词。特别是我们去年访问中国受到毛主席接见的文艺工作者，更有责任把毛主席的这个重要题词宣传好。
    日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）代表松井志郎在欢呼毛主席书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表时说，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践紧紧地结合起来，这是日本一切革命者所必须坚持的最根本的原则，也是日本革命获得胜利的根本保证。
    松井说，毛主席教导我们说：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”日本革命的领导阶级和主力军是工人阶级。日本工人阶级必须在毛泽东思想指引下，在斗争中，加强和发展自己的革命队伍，以便完成日本革命的伟大历史使命。
    日本共产党大阪府委员会（左派）代表保田敏男说：我们认为，现在比任何时候都应该认真地努力学习毛泽东同志的这一光辉题词。保田指出：今天，世界革命已经进入了一个伟大的新时代。日本人民的革命斗争正在走向新的高潮。他说，我们在学习毛主席著作时，特别重视理论与实践相结合，以便用毛泽东思想解决实际问题。
    日本“毛泽东思想学院”院长大塚有章说，毛主席在六年前书赠日本工人朋友的重要题词的发表，使我们感到莫大的鼓舞。
    他指出：日共宫本修正主义叛徒集团借口所谓日本的“国内外条件不同”，竭力歪曲马克思列宁主义的最根本的原则，反对用暴力夺取政权，鼓吹“和平革命”，标榜所谓“独立自主”路线，这是最可耻的叛徒行为。
