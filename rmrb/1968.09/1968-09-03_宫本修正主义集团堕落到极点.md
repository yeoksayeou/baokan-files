The revisionist group of Maki has fallen to the extreme. They colluded with the reactionary authorities of Kyushu University in Fukuoka to attempt to remove the wreckage of an American plane, aiding the U.S. imperialists in covering up their crimes.

Patriotic students rose up in opposition, and the reactionary plot was thwarted.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: The revisionist group of Maki in the Japanese Communist Party actively conspired with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to plot the removal of the wreckage of a U.S. military plane that crashed at Kyushu University. This plot was thwarted in the face of the resolute struggle of Japanese patriotic students.

On June 2 of this year, a U.S. military fighter-bomber crashed into a building at the Faculty of Engineering of Kyushu University in Fukuoka City, burning down an under-construction large building. This serious crime by the U.S. imperialists aroused the extreme indignation of the patriotic students and the broad masses of the Japanese people, sparking strong protests and demonstrations.

The U.S. imperialists and the reactionary Sato government in Japan are terrified of the growing anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. They sent out large numbers of armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators while trying every means to remove the wreckage of the U.S. military plane that crashed at Kyushu University, attempting to eliminate evidence of U.S. crimes and quell the people's struggle. However, this plot by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries was met with resolute opposition from the awakening patriotic students and the broad masses of the Japanese people and could not succeed.

Just as the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries were at a loss, the revisionist group of Maki, in order to serve the U.S. imperialists and the Sato reactionary government, immediately ran around, colluding with the reactionary school authorities. Under the pretext of "early reconstruction" of the building, they deceived some people who did not understand the truth. On June 20, they held a so-called "rally" at Kyushu University to attempt to remove the wreckage of the U.S. military plane, aiming to complete the task that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries could not accomplish.

The patriotic students of Kyushu University, who insisted on the anti-U.S. struggle, immediately launched a resolute counterattack against this plot by the Maki group. On the afternoon of June 20, they held a powerful demonstration and struggle on campus, bravely rushing into the venue controlled by the Maki group, exposing and condemning the shameful crimes of the Maki group serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The brave patriotic students reinforced the barriers at the site where the American bandit plane crashed and stood guard until late at night. The students' just struggle foiled the plan of the Maki group and the reactionary school authorities to remove the wreckage of the U.S. military plane.

    宫本修正主义集团堕落到极点
    竟同福冈九州大学反动当局串通一气企图搬走美机残骸，替美帝掩盖罪迹
    爱国青年学生奋起反对  反动阴谋遭到挫败
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日共宫本修正主义集团帮助美日反动派积极策划搬走坠落在九州大学的美军飞机残骸的阴谋，在日本爱国学生的坚决斗争面前遭到了可耻的失败。
    今年六月二日，一架美军战斗轰炸机坠落在福冈市九州大学工学部的建筑物上，焚毁了兴建中的一座大楼。美帝的这一严重罪行，激起了九州大学爱国学生和广大日本人民的无比愤怒，引起了强大的抗议示威。
    美帝国主义和日本佐藤反动政府对于日益高涨的日本人民的反美爱国斗争怕得要死，他们一面出动大批武装警察野蛮镇压示威群众，一面千方百计地要把坠落在九州大学的美军飞机残骸搬走，企图消除美帝罪证，平息群众斗争。但是，美日反动派的这一阴谋遭到了日益觉醒的九州大学的爱国学生和广大日本人民的坚决反对，一直未能得逞。
    就在美日反动派一筹莫展的时候，日共宫本修正主义集团为了向美帝和佐藤反动政府效犬马之劳，立即东窜西跳，勾结反动的学校当局，借口“早日修建”这座大楼，蒙蔽一些不明真相的人，六月二十日在九州大学内举行了一个所谓“奋起大会”，妄图动手搬走美军飞机残骸，以完成美日反动派所完成不了的“任务”。
    坚持反美斗争的九州大学的爱国学生，对宫本集团的这一阴谋立即进行了坚决的反击。六月二十日下午，他们在校内展开了强有力的示威游行和斗争，勇敢地冲进由宫本集团控制的会场，揭露和谴责宫本集团为美日反动派效劳的可耻罪行。英勇的爱国学生在美国强盗飞机坠落的现场加固了障垒，一直坚守到深夜。学生的正义斗争使宫本集团和反动的学校当局企图搬走美军飞机残骸的计划化为泡影。
