In the midst of the nation's jubilant celebration of China's red landscape, joyous news has come from the frontline of the southeastern coast: the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee has been born amidst fierce class struggle.

On September 22, Xinhua News Agency reported from Xiamen: Amidst the thunderous roar of anti-American and anti-Chiang battles, and the intense struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee has been born in glory.

Xiamen, located at the forefront of Fujian Province's coastal defense, was once a crucial naval base for the Kuomintang reactionaries and the last strategic defense line for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the mainland. After liberation, the heroic military and civilian population of the Xiamen frontline, with one hand holding a gun and the other a hoe, built a long causeway in the sea during the fierce artillery battles against the American-Chiang bandits on Jinmen Island, transforming Xiamen Island into a peninsula. Since then, trains from the heart of the motherland—Beijing—have arrived in Xiamen, and factories have been built on the island, providing strong support for the construction of socialist China and the struggle against the enemy. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of top capitalist roaders within the party, along with their agents in Fujian Province and Xiamen, represented the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They colluded with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism in Xiamen. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Xiamen, with its glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the revolutionary masses, followed the victorious course charted by the great leader Chairman Mao, broke through numerous obstacles, and engaged in fierce struggles and repeated confrontations with a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders. They finally achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xiamen.

Currently, the situation in heroic Xiamen is better than ever. A wave of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination is sweeping through factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and people's communes. Over 95% of the industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial systems, as well as districts, communes, and production teams, have achieved revolutionary unity. The industrial and agricultural fronts present a thriving scene.

The soldiers and officers of the Xiamen frontline units, who guard the coastal defense day and night and fight on the frontline of the "three supports, two militaries," have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and made tremendous contributions to defending the coastal defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The unity between the military and the people has been further strengthened and developed.

On September 19, 200,000 military and civilian personnel of Xiamen held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee. From the "Red Flag of the Sea" at the forefront of the anti-enemy struggle—Qingyu, to the "Dazhai-style brigade" across the water from the enemy—Hengcuo, red flags waved and victory songs echoed everywhere. The revolutionary people enthusiastically shouted in unison: "Unite, proletarian revolutionaries, and fight the enemy together! We will definitely liberate Taiwan! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Zhang Zhiyong, the chairman of the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration. He said that the establishment of the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee does not mean the end of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We must not relax our vigilance and must welcome greater victories with new battles, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and let the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in Xiamen.

Zhang Zhiyong said that Xiamen is on the frontline of national defense, and class struggle is particularly sharp and complex. We must hold high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people" and "supporting the government and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, and consolidate military-civilian relations. We must not let the class enemies' plot to sow discord between the military and the people, and between the people and the revolutionary committee, succeed. All military and civilian personnel must cherish, support, and defend the newly born revolutionary committee.

Dian Shixing, a responsible comrade of the PLA units stationed in Xiamen, congratulated the birth of the Xiamen Revolutionary Committee on behalf of all soldiers and officers. He expressed that he would always remember the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao, be highly vigilant, strengthen preparedness, be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time, and be ready to give a crushing blow to any class enemy who dares to invade, forever defending the newly born revolutionary committee.

Lu Sheng, a responsible comrade of the Fujian frontline units and the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, participated in the meeting and spoke.

Representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, students, and revolutionary cadres of Xiamen also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting finally passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. After the meeting, a celebratory parade was held.

    在全国欢庆祖国山河一片红的凯歌声中东南海防前哨传来振奋人心的喜讯
    厦门市革命委员会在激烈的阶级搏斗中胜利诞生
    二十万军民集会热烈庆祝，千遍万遍地高呼：“无产阶级革命派联合起来，共同对敌！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    新华社厦门二十二日电　在全国军民欢庆祖国山河一片红的凯歌声中，祖国东南海防最前哨——厦门，传来了振奋人心的消息：厦门市革命委员会，在反美、反蒋的隆隆炮声中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，光荣诞生了。
    地处福建省海防最前线的厦门，解放前是国民党反动派的重要海军基地，也是美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮在大陆上进行顽抗的最后一道战略防线。解放后，英雄的厦门前线军民，一手拿枪，一手拿锄，在严惩金门岛上美蒋匪军的炮战中，移山填海，在海上筑起了长堤，使厦门岛变成了半岛。从此来自祖国心脏——北京的列车开进了厦门岛，岛上建起了一座座工厂，有力地支援了社会主义祖国的建设和对敌斗争。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在福建省、厦门市的代理人，代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，与美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮内外呼应，竭力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图在厦门复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，具有反帝斗争光荣传统的厦门市工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的胜利航向，冲破重重阻力，同一小撮叛徒、特务和死不悔改的走资派进行了激烈的斗争和反复较量，终于夺取了厦门市无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    当前，英雄的厦门市形势空前大好。各工厂、企业、机关、学校和人民公社的革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮一浪高过一浪。工交、财贸系统和区、社、场已有百分之九十五以上实现了革命大联合。工农业战线呈现一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    日夜守卫在海防最前线，奋战在“三支”“两军”第一线的厦门前线部队广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为保卫海防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命，作出了巨大的贡献，军民之间的团结更加巩固和发展。
    九月十九日，厦门市二十万军民举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝厦门市革命委员会成立。从对敌斗争最前哨的“海岛红旗”——青屿，到与敌人只一水之隔的“大寨式大队”——珩厝，到处红旗漫卷，凯歌阵阵。广大革命人民千遍万遍地热烈高呼：“无产阶级革命派联合起来，共同对敌！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    厦门市革命委员会主任张志勇同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，厦门市革命委员会的成立，绝不意味着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的结束。我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性，要用新的战斗来迎接更大的胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在厦门上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
    张志勇同志说，厦门地处国防最前线，阶级斗争特别尖锐复杂，我们一定更高地举起“拥军爱民”、“拥政爱民”的伟大旗帜，加强军民团结，密切军民关系，决不让阶级敌人挑拨军民关系、挑拨人民群众同革命委员会的关系的阴谋得逞。全体军民都要爱护、支持、保卫新生的革命委员会。
    中国人民解放军驻厦门前线部队负责人田世兴同志，代表全体指战员在大会上热烈祝贺厦门市革命委员会的诞生。他表示，一定牢记伟大统帅毛主席的教导，百倍警惕，加强战备，随时准备解放台湾，随时准备给胆敢来犯的阶级敌人以歼灭性的打击，永远保卫新生的革命委员会。
    福建前线部队负责人卢胜同志，代表福建前线部队、福建省革命委员会参加了大会，并讲了话。
    厦门市的工人、贫下中农、学生和革命领导干部的代表，也先后在大会上讲话。
    大会最后通过了给最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。会后，举行了庆祝游行。
