Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions have greatly inspired the working class to press forward courageously. Shanghai's million industrial workers bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

	Newspaper reporter from Shanghai, September 3rd: Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fully playing the leading role of the working class have inspired Shanghai's million industrial workers to press forward courageously. Recently, many factories in Shanghai, while sending a large number of excellent workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to take up positions in colleges and universities, have seen the workers remaining in the factories engage in even more profound and sustained revolutionary criticism, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, and use revolution to promote production. The entire industrial front of the city has presented a more magnificent and vigorous scene of advance.

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian cultural revolution, it is necessary for the working class to take the lead, for the working class to participate, and for the workers to cooperate with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to form a revolutionary three-in-one combination with the students, teachers, and workers in schools who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools and to lead the schools permanently. In the countryside, it is necessary for the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—to manage the schools." Under the inspiration of this great instruction from Chairman Mao, many factories in Shanghai have selected a large number of excellent workers to join the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to take up positions in schools. After the workers who joined the workers' propaganda teams left the factories, the workers who continued to fight on the production front expressed their determination to grasp revolution and promote production, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factories well, and to support the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in taking up positions in schools to carry out the cultural revolution with actual actions. They told their comrades who went to new battlefronts: "You have left, and no matter how great the difficulties, we will bear them! No matter how heavy the tasks, we will undertake them! We must make the grasp of revolution and promotion of production even better!"

	Due to the great revolutionary spirit displayed by the broad revolutionary masses, the industrial production situation in the city in August became better and better. The output of the metallurgy, machinery, chemical, textile, and light industries all increased significantly compared to July. Some important factories in the city, such as the No. 3 Steel Plant, Wujing Thermal Power Plant, Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, Shanghai Tool Plant, Shanghai Valve Plant No. 1, Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard, Hudong Shipyard, Shanghai Lamp Plant No. 1, Shanghai Cotton Textile Mill No. 17, and Shanghai Bicycle Plant, all saw significant increases in production in August.

	The workers fighting on the production front regard the further implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the most important task at present. They say that to complete the great historical mission given to the working class by Chairman Mao, the most fundamental thing is to rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After Shanghai Machine Tool Plant sent a large number of excellent workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, the revolution and production in the factory became even more vigorous. The entire plant held "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style" Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, review and summarize the achievements of the previous stage, further identify gaps, and intensify class struggle to launch more fierce attacks on the class enemies. The revolutionary criticism in the entire plant, with workshops as the base, was carried out vigorously. Every day, the workshops set up battlefields to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. So far, the plant has conducted more than a thousand class-based criticisms. The high revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers in the entire plant has brought about even greater leaps in production. Although the number of workers decreased, the production of grinding machines exceeded the original plan by 18%.

	Chairman Mao recently taught: "Establish revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, and transfer office personnel. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages." Under the inspiration of this brilliant instruction from Chairman Mao, the working class of Shanghai has launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories. The revolutionary workers of Wujing Thermal Power Plant, based on the achievements of streamlining organizations and transferring office personnel, continued to criticize the revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, break the old regulations and systems that shackle the workers' hands and feet and suppress the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm, and further liberate the productive forces. Although the number of production workers in the entire plant has decreased significantly compared to the past, the daily power generation has maintained the highest historical level.

	The Shanghai workers fighting on the production front, in order to better shoulder the burden of grasping revolution and promoting production, have also launched a mass technical innovation and technological revolution movement. The No. 3 Steel Plant in Shanghai has reformed many processes, simplified many procedures, and created many new innovation projects. The output of steel and steel products in August increased by 30% to 80%, and 12 new products were successfully trial-produced. The No. 2 furnace in the casting steel workshop used to take three hours to smelt a furnace of steel, but after launching technical innovation recently, it has been shortened to more than one hour. The No. 1 Valve Plant in Shanghai has completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule this year, and some members of the revolutionary committee were originally concerned that after a batch of workers were sent to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, it would affect the completion of the annual production plan. The workers in the factory dispelled the unnecessary concerns of some members of the revolutionary committee with actual actions. They launched a mass technical innovation and technological revolution, and in August, not only did they overfulfill the original plan, but they also achieved three unprecedented feats: the highest output value, the highest output, and the best quality.

    伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示极大地鼓舞着工人阶级奋勇前进
    上海百万产业工人勇挑革命生产两副重担
    许多工厂在派出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队进驻高等学校的情况下，留厂工人更加深入持久地开展革命大批判，认真搞好本单位斗、批、改，八月份全市工业生产上升幅度尤为显著
    新华社上海三日电　伟大领袖毛主席关于充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的最新指示，鼓舞着上海百万产业工人奋勇前进。最近以来，上海许多工厂在派出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队进驻高等学校的情况下，留厂工人更加深入持久地开展革命大批判，认真搞好本单位斗、批、改，以革命推动生产，全市工业战线呈现出一派更加波澜壮阔、朝气勃勃的跃进景象。
    毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”在毛主席这一伟大指示鼓舞下，上海许多工厂挑选了大批优秀工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校。参加工人宣传队的工人离开工厂后，继续战斗在生产岗位上的工人纷纷表示，一定要抓革命促生产，把工厂的斗、批、改搞好，以实际行动支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校搞好教育革命。他们对开到新的战斗岗位的战友们说：你们走了，困难再大我们顶！任务再重我们担！一定要把抓革命促生产搞得好上加好！
    由于广大革命职工发扬了无比高昂的革命精神，八月份全市工业生产形势越来越好。冶金、机电、化工、纺织、轻工业行业的产量，都比七月份增长很多。全市一些重要工厂，如上钢三厂、吴泾热电厂、上海机床厂、上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂、上海柴油机厂、上海工具厂、上海阀门一厂、上海东方红造船厂、沪东造船厂、上海灯泡一厂、上海第十七棉纺织厂、上海自行车厂等工厂，八月份生产上升幅度尤为显著。
    战斗在生产岗位上的工人，把进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，作为当前头等重要的任务。他们说，要完成毛主席交给工人阶级的伟大历史使命，最根本的就是要依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。上海机床厂派出一大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队以后，厂里的革命和生产更加热气腾腾。全厂普遍举办了落实毛主席最新指示的“抗大式”毛泽东思想学习班，对照毛主席的教导，回顾总结了前一阶段的胜利成果，进一步找出差距，狠抓阶级斗争，更加猛烈地向阶级敌人打进攻战。全厂以班组为基点的革命大批判，搞得轰轰烈烈。车间里，每天都摆开了批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的战场。到目前为止，这个厂的班组大批判已经进行了上千次。全厂工人高涨的革命热情，带来了生产上的更大飞跃。八月份工人减少了，生产的磨床却超过原订计划百分之十八。
    毛主席最近教导说：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”上海工人阶级在毛主席这一光辉指示鼓舞下，掀起了工厂的斗、批、改高潮。吴泾热电厂革命职工在精简机构、下放科室人员取得一定成绩的基础上，继续大批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义黑货，大破束缚工人手脚、压制工人革命积极性的旧规章制度，进一步解放了生产力。全厂生产工人虽比过去减少很多，但每天的发电量却保持了历史最高水平。
    战斗在生产岗位上的上海工人，为了更好地挑起抓革命促生产的重担，还开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。上海第三钢铁厂改革了许多工艺，简化了许多工序，创造了许多新的革新项目，八月份钢和钢材的产量增长百分之三十到八十，并且试制成功了十二种新产品。铸钢车间的二号炉过去炼一炉钢最快需要三小时，最近开展技术革新以后，缩短到一个多小时。上海阀门一厂今年以来生产月月超额完成计划，厂革委会个别成员原来担心抽出一批工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队以后，会影响全年生产计划的提前完成。厂里工人以实际行动打破了厂革委会某些成员不必要的顾虑。他们大搞技术革新和技术革命，八月份不仅超额完成了原订的计划，而且达到了三个空前：产值空前大，产量空前高，质量空前好。
