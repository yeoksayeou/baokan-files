Military and civilians in central Vietnam's central region annihilated over 13,500 enemies in ten days of fighting from August 22 to 31. Among the casualties were over 3,000 American invaders and South Korean mercenaries. The region's forces completely annihilated or severely damaged one enemy main force regiment, 11 battalions, and nearly 30 companies.

During this period, the central region's military and civilians also shot down or destroyed over 100 enemy aircraft, destroyed over 500 vehicles (including 130 tanks and armored cars), and 30 cannons. They also destroyed many warehouses and weapons, cut off several important transportation lines, including the 1st, 14th, and 19th highways, and leveled dozens of enemy outposts and sentry points. They also destroyed over 110 "strategic hamlets" and "resettlement areas," liberating many villages and communes.

	The people's liberation armed forces in the Hue region launched a fierce attack on an American military outpost 12 kilometers south of Hue City on August 29. They completely annihilated an American artillery battalion, an infantry company, and a command post, killing and wounding 451 American invaders. They also destroyed 12 cannons, one helicopter, and several warehouses, seizing a large amount of weapons.

	The report said that the American outpost south of Hue City was established to prevent the people's liberation armed forces from launching new attacks on Hue City and to use it as a base for "sweeping" operations in the mountains of Thua Thien Province. The outpost was built on a hill with strong fortifications, guarded by an artillery battalion and an infantry company.

	With deep hatred for the American aggressors, the people's liberation armed forces in the Hue region displayed a resolute offensive spirit. As soon as the battle began, they broke through the enemy's defenses, stormed the enemy's stronghold, and used grenades, hand grenades, and submachine guns to eliminate the enemy hiding in bunkers and fortifications. The entire enemy outpost was immediately engulfed in flames. In just 35 minutes, the people's liberation armed forces captured the outpost, achieving a brilliant victory.

	The command of the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam decided to award the First-Class Liberation Medal to the units that distinguished themselves in this battle.

	According to reports from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the military and civilians in Dinh Tuong, Kien Tuong, and Soai Rap provinces also annihilated many enemy forces in the second half of August.

	In Dinh Tuong Province, from August 20 to 27, the military and civilians continuously attacked many enemy targets, annihilating and dissolving nearly 900 enemies. They sank six warships and motorboats, destroyed and burned one ammunition depot, one fuel depot, and 20 barracks.

	In Kien Tuong Province, from August 21 to 30, the military and civilians annihilated and dissolved over 500 enemies, severely damaging one company and one "pacification team."

	In Soai Rap Province, from August 20 to 27, the military and civilians continuously attacked many enemy outposts and sentry points, killing over 350 enemies, destroying 10 aircraft and five vehicles, and capturing one sentry point.
