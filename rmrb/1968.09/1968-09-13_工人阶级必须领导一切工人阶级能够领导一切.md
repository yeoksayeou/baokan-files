Our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle.

The working class must lead everything the working class can lead everything

—The Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Shenyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Plant discusses their experiences in learning from the working class

The working class is the most selfless

The practice of "three supports and two militaries" over the past year has made us deeply feel that the recent instruction of our great leader Chairman Mao that "we must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work" is extremely wise and correct. "Because only the working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution."

Workshop One of the Shenyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Plant is responsible for processing semi-finished products and is the "throat" of the entire plant's production. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the plant's capitalist-roaders spread a large amount of counter-revolutionary revisionist poison in this workshop. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the plant's capitalist-roaders again used this workshop as one of their main battlefields to sabotage the revolution and disrupt production. There is a highly respected production foreman, veteran worker, and Communist Party member, Guo Yongping, in this workshop, who is the cousin of a capitalist-roader in the plant. This capitalist-roader threatened Guo Yongping several times to withdraw from the revolutionary mass organization, but all were firmly rejected by Guo Yongping.

The capitalist-roader, in order to further sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, incited and deceived some people to leave their production posts and create a shutdown incident. The furnace was about to shut down. Guo Yongping remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Never forget class struggle." He realized that the capitalist-roader's creation of a shutdown incident was to strangle us from the production side to achieve the goal of sabotaging the revolution. Therefore, he actively discussed with veteran workers how to smash the enemy's plot. Everyone said: "We workers must make Chairman Mao proud. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, even if there are fewer people and greater difficulties, the furnace must not stop; we will not eat or sleep, working 24 hours a day, we must fight against the capitalist-roaders!" In the intense battle, the workers ate and slept in the workshop, day and night fighting by the high-temperature furnace of over 1,000 degrees. Just as the struggle was intense, Guo Yongping received an urgent telegram informing him of his father's death, asking him to return home to handle the funeral. He thought, the battle against the capitalist-roader has just begun, one less person means one less fighting force, no matter how big the personal matter is, it is not as important as defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, so he put personal matters aside and continued to fight. It was with this spirit of iron will and sky-high enthusiasm that the workers ensured that production not only did not stop but also increased daily output from the original 23-24 tons to over 30 tons, completing the production task with overfulfillment and thoroughly smashing the enemy's evil plot to create a shutdown and sabotage the revolution.

The comrades' fighting deeds deeply educated us: the working class is the most selfless, has the firmest stand, the clearest hatred and love, loves Chairman Mao the most, and hates the Chinese Khrushchov and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party the most. We are determined to take the working class as our model, humbly learn from the working class, closely rely on the working class, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end together with the working class.

The working class understands the importance of power the most

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. In the course of supporting the left, through fighting side by side with the working class, we deeply feel that the working class, because they were most heavily oppressed and exploited by the exploiting classes in the old society and most deeply persecuted by the Chinese Khrushchov after liberation, understand Chairman Mao's great teaching most profoundly and understand the importance of seizing and consolidating power the most.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Workshop Two of the Shenyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Plant had two veteran workers and Communist Party members, Hong Changren and Shen Songhe, who actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call and strongly opposed the handful of capitalist-roaders in the plant, becoming thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones. This handful of capitalist-roaders, in order to restore capitalism, during the fake seizure of power in the entire plant, politically persecuted these two veteran workers, forcibly removed them from their work posts, stripped them of their "official" positions, and labeled them as "counter-revolutionaries." The capitalist-roader's vicious methods did not make them yield. In the old society, these two veteran workers' families had been working for the landlords for generations, and they had suffered from the landlords' exploitation and oppression since childhood. They deeply understood that in the old society, they suffered because the power was in the hands of the landlords and capitalists; today, they can be masters of the country because the working class has seized power. They thought: this power must not be lost, with Chairman Mao supporting us and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we must be able to seize it back! Thus, they fought a head-on battle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the plant. The two veteran workers said: "You stripping us of our workshop foreman and team leader positions is not just a matter of taking power from us two individuals, you are taking power from the entire working class! This power is given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao, and we must not let you bastards take it away!" These two veteran workers, in order to seize back the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, actively participated in the struggle against the old provincial and municipal committees and the handful of capitalist-roaders in the plant, resisted the wrong trends, fought against the evil currents, often went without sleep and food, and always fought on the front line. At the same time, they used their experiences to propagandize to the broad masses of workers the importance of defending the leadership of the working class. They discussed with the broad masses of workers the pain of being powerless, the happiness of having power, the importance of seizing power, and the responsibility of defending power, making everyone realize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to seize back the power usurped by the capitalist-roaders and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only when the working class is united can we seize back the power. Through their active work, the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations in the workshop quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. With the firm support of the broad masses of workers, these two veteran workers finally returned to their original work posts in victory. Currently, under the leadership of these two veteran workers, the situation of revolution and production in this workshop is excellent. The monthly output of products has exceeded the historical highest level.

The fighting deeds of these two veteran workers made us deeply feel that the working class must lead everything, and the working class can lead everything. As long as power is in the hands of the working class, our socialist country will never change color. We must humbly learn from the working class, firmly grasp the guns in our hands, be the strong pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees together with the working class.

The working class has the most technical authority

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." In our work of supporting the left in the Shenyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Plant, we deeply feel that the working class is not only the sole leading class of the revolution but also the true master of science and technology.

The plant produces over a thousand "extrusion dies" each month. In the past, producing these dies was complicated, costly, wasteful, and they would break down after a few minutes of use, seriously affecting production and becoming a long-standing problem in the plant's production. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers had repeatedly proposed to revolutionize the "extrusion die," but these proposals were suppressed by the plant's capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities."

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers have raised high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," strongly opposed the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," and pulled them down from their horses. Workers again proposed to solve this problem and advocated the use of advanced precision casting technology. Someone in the plant then sent two technicians to this university and that research institute, everywhere seeking advice from "experts." Some technical "authorities" shook their heads, putting on a servile attitude, saying: "There is no record in foreign literature, and we have been researching for many years without success, can you succeed? Just follow the old methods." The two technicians returned to the plant and told the workers, and everyone was so angry they wanted to explode. The workers said, these "authorities" only know how to hold onto the legs of foreigners and follow behind foreigners. Kick out these bourgeois experts, we workers will do it ourselves! We are revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and will not be intimidated by foreigners and reactionary technical "authorities." We must have what foreigners have, and we must have what foreigners do not have! We must struggle for Chairman Mao's glory and for the working class's honor. Everyone said do and did it. Many workers from the plant rushed to contribute strategies and ideas. During the trial production, it was found that the "extrusion dies" cast had cracks as soon as they were used. The two technicians flipped through many technical documents but found no solution, so they consulted the workers. Master craftsman Su Baotian, relying on his many years of practical experience, came up with a solution and quickly solved the problem. In this way, the precision casting of "extrusion dies" that the internal and external technical "authorities" had not dared to imagine for many years was finally completed by the workers in just a few months. After adopting this new method, the process was greatly reduced, the quality was greatly improved, the cost was greatly reduced, and a large amount of high-grade alloy steel was saved for the country, and a new path was opened up for the production of other dies and tools.

From this technological revolution, we see: the working class is the smartest, most talented, and has the most technical authority. The working class must lead everything, and it can lead everything. All scientific and technological fronts must be led by the working class. We must closely rely on the working class, break through all bourgeois old systems and foreign frameworks, and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the factory.

    我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。
    工人阶级必须领导一切工人阶级能够领导一切
    ——解放军某部驻沈阳有色金属加工厂毛泽东思想宣传队畅谈向工人阶级学习的体会
          工人阶级最大公无私
    一年多来“三支”“两军”工作的实践，使我们深刻地体会到，伟大领袖毛主席最近关于“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，非常英明，非常正确。“因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”
    沈阳有色金属加工厂一车间是加工半成品的车间，是全厂生产的“咽喉”。无产阶级文化大革命以前，厂内走资派在这个车间散布了大量的反革命修正主义毒素。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，厂内走资派又把这个车间当作他们破坏革命、破坏生产的一个主要阵地。这个车间有个威信很高的生产班长、老工人、共产党员郭永平，是厂内一个走资派的堂弟。这个走资派为了分裂工人阶级队伍，几次威胁郭永平退出革命群众组织，但是，都被郭永平义正词严地顶了回去。
    走资派为了进一步破坏无产阶级文化大革命，煽动蒙蔽一部分人离开生产岗位，制造停产事件，反射炉眼看就要停产了。郭永平想起了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，认识到：走资派制造停产事故，就是从生产上卡我们的脖子，达到破坏革命的目的。于是，他就积极和老工人们研究如何粉碎阶级敌人制造的阴谋。大家说：“我们工人阶级一定要为毛主席争气。为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，人再少，困难再大，炉子也不能停；不吃饭，不睡觉，二十四小时连轴转，我们也要同走资派干！”在紧张的战斗中，工人们吃在车间，睡在车间，日日夜夜战斗在一千多度的高温炉旁。正在斗争激烈的时候，郭永平接到父亲逝世的加急电报，要他回家处理后事。他想，同走资派的这场战斗刚刚开始，少一个人就是少一分战斗力，个人的事再大，也没有保卫毛主席革命路线的事大，便把私事放在一边，继续坚持战斗。工人们就是用这种硬骨头精神和冲天干劲，使生产不但没有中断，而且日产量由原来的二十三、四吨提高到三十多吨，超额完成了生产任务，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人制造停产、破坏革命的罪恶阴谋。
    工人同志的这些斗争事迹深深教育了我们：工人阶级最大公无私，立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，对毛主席最热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派最仇恨。我们决心以工人阶级为榜样，虚心向工人阶级学习，紧紧依靠工人阶级，同工人阶级一起把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
      工人阶级最懂得政权的重要
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切。我们在支左过程中，通过同工人阶级并肩战斗，深深体会到：工人阶级由于在旧社会受剥削阶级的压榨剥削最重，解放后受中国赫鲁晓夫的迫害最深，因此，他们对毛主席这一伟大教导理解得最深刻，最懂得夺取政权和巩固政权的重要。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，沈阳有色金属加工厂二车间，有两个老工人、共产党员洪长仁和沈松合，由于积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，大造厂内一小撮走资派的反，被走资派看作眼中钉、肉中刺。这一小撮走资派为了复辟资本主义，在搞全厂假夺权时，对这两个老工人施加了种种政治迫害，强行调离了他们的工作岗位，罢了他们的“官”，把他们打成“反革命”。走资派的毒辣手段，并没有使他们屈服。在旧社会，这两个老工人家里，祖祖辈辈都给地主扛活，他们从小就受地主的剥削和压迫。他们深深懂得，在旧社会所以受苦，就是因为印把子攥在地主、资本家手里；今天能够当家做主人，就是因为我们工人阶级掌握了政权。他们想：这个权绝对不能丢，有毛主席给我们撑腰，有毛泽东思想作武器，这个权我们一定能夺回来！于是，他们同厂内一小撮走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争。两位老工人说：“你们罢我们工段长和小组长的
  ‘官’，这不是夺我们两个人的权的问题，你们夺的是整个工人阶级的权！这个权是党和毛主席交给我们的，决不能让你们这帮坏家伙夺了去！”这两个老工人为了把被党内一小撮走资派篡夺去的权夺回来，还积极参加了对旧省、市委和厂内一小撮走资派的斗争，顶歪风，战恶浪，经常不睡觉、不吃饭，始终战斗在第一线。同时，还用自己的经历向广大工人宣传保卫工人阶级领导权的重要性。他们同广大工人一起，回忆无权的痛苦，谈有权的幸福，夺权的重要，保权的责任，使大家认识到，无产阶级文化大革命就是把走资派篡夺了的权夺回来，巩固无产阶级专政。只有工人阶级团结一致，才能把权夺回来。经他们积极做工作，使车间两派革命群众组织很快实现了革命大联合。这两个老工人在广大工人的坚决支持下，终于胜利地回到了原来的工作岗位。目前，这个工段，在这两个老工人的带领下，革命和生产形势一片大好。产品的月产量超过了历史最高水平。
    这两个老工人的斗争事迹，使我们深深体会到：工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够领导一切。政权只要掌握在工人阶级手里，我们的社会主义国家就永远不会变颜色。我们一定要虚心向工人阶级学习，紧握手中枪，做无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，同工人阶级一起捍卫新生的革命委员会。
          工人阶级最有技术权威
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”我们在沈阳有色金属加工厂支左工作中，深深地体会到，工人阶级不但是革命的唯一领导阶级，而且也是科学技术的真正主人。
    这个厂每月要用上千个“挤压模具”。过去制造这种模具，工序复杂，成本高，浪费大，而且使用几分钟就报废了，严重地影响了生产，成了全厂生产上的一个“老大难”问题。无产阶级文化大革命前，工人们几次提出要革“挤压模具”的命，都被厂内走资派和反动技术“权威”扼杀了。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，广大革命工人高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，大造了走资派和反动技术“权威”的反，把他们拉下了马。工人们再次提出解决这个问题，并倡议采用先进的精密铸造技术。厂内有人便派了两名技术员，跑这个大学，到那个研究院，到处向“专家”请教。有些技术“权威”摇头晃脑，摆出一副洋奴相说：“外国文献上没有记载，我们研究了多年也没搞成功，你们还能搞出来？还是按老办法干吧！”两个技术员回到厂里对工人们一讲，大家肺都要气炸了。工人们说，这帮“权威”，就知道抱着洋人的大腿不放，跟在外国人屁股后边爬。踢开这帮资产阶级专家，咱们工人自己干！我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人，决不能被洋人和反动技术
  “权威”吓倒。外国人有的我们要有，外国人没有的我们也要有！一定要为毛主席争光，为工人阶级争气。大家说干就干，全厂许多工人闻风而上，主动献策献计。在试制过程中，发现铸造出来的“挤压模具”一用就裂缝，两个技术员翻了不少技术资料，找不到解决办法，他们就向工人们请教。老师傅苏宝田，凭着他多年的实践经验，想出了一个办法，很快解决了这个难题。就这样，厂内外技术“权威”多年不敢设想的精密铸造“挤压模具”，终于被工人们只用几个月时间就搞成了。采用这种新方法后，工序大大减少，质量大大提高，成本大大降低，为国家节约了大量高级合金钢，并为其他模具、工具生产，闯出了一条新路。
    从这项技术革命中，使我们看到：工人阶级最聪明，最有才能，最有技术权威。工人阶级必须领导一切，而且能够领导一切，一切科学技术阵地也必须由工人阶级来领导。我们一定要紧紧依靠工人阶级，打破一切资产阶级的旧制度和洋框框，彻底地搞好工厂的斗批改。
