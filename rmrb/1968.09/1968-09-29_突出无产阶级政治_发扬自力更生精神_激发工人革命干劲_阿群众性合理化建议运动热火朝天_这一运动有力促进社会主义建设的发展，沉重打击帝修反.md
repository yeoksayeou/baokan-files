The broad masses of workers in Albania are actively implementing the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to self-reliance, and vigorously carrying out technical innovations and rationalization suggestion movements. This movement has powerfully promoted the socialist construction in Albania and once again dealt a heavy blow to the savage blockade by imperialism and revisionism.

Since last October, when the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, delivered his report "On Cooperation and the Scientific-Technological Revolution," the broad masses of workers in Albania, following the teachings of Comrade Hoxha, have launched a vigorous, mass-based technical innovation and rationalization suggestion movement, achieving remarkable results. By the first half of this year, 190 new production lines, workshops, and factories have been established nationwide in Albania, producing 760 new types of equipment, machinery, and products. In the first eight months of this year, workers in the Fier District proposed 2,700 inventions and rationalization suggestions, of which 1,250 have been implemented; during the same period, workers in the Korça District proposed more than 1,800 inventions and rationalization suggestions, of which 1,300 have been realized.

In his report "On Cooperation and the Scientific-Technological Revolution," Comrade Hoxha pointed out: "Just as any true revolution, the scientific and technological revolution will be carried out by the broad masses of the people and the broad masses of workers." Workers in many industrial and mining enterprises in Tirana, Fier, and other places, following this directive, have established new technical design offices, absorbing many workers and technicians, and set up core groups in each workshop to specifically discuss and implement various suggestions. This has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers, enabling many technical and technological problems in the factories to be solved more effectively and quickly.

The innovators and rationalization suggestion makers at the Tirana Automobile Repair Factory, after numerous experiments, successfully developed many automobile parts and components that were previously imported, improving the quality of some products. At the same time, they established a ten-person team, with a spirit of self-reliance, built six cranes, significantly improving labor efficiency and reducing the labor intensity of the workers. Workers in the machine repair workshop of the Tirana Stalin Textile Combine produced 38 types of parts that were previously imported in the first eight months of this year. Thus, about 96% of the parts that this factory frequently needs can now be self-sufficient. The workers are determined to continue their efforts and produce 56 new types of parts by the end of this year. Workers at the Fier Geological Company self-reliantly manufactured an automatic drilling machine in three months. Workers in the Durrës District also manufactured a 320-ton hydraulic press, an electric hoist with a lifting capacity of five tons, and ten other new types of electrical materials. An innovator at the Rubik Copper Smelting Plant, together with the mechanical workers in the plant, manufactured a washing machine that extracts a significant amount of copper ore from low-grade brown soil.

Through the practical struggle of technical innovation and rationalization suggestions, many workers have further strengthened their confidence in self-reliance, developed the noble quality of placing collective interests above personal interests, and greatly enhanced their socialist political awareness. At the same time, due to the full play of collective wisdom and strength in the innovation movement, the ties and cooperation between technical personnel and workers have become even closer.

    突出无产阶级政治　发扬自力更生精神　激发工人革命干劲
    阿群众性合理化建议运动热火朝天
    这一运动有力促进社会主义建设的发展，沉重打击帝修反
    新华社地拉那二十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大职工积极贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议，突出无产阶级政治，坚持自力更生，蓬蓬勃勃地开展技术革新和合理化建议运动。这一运动有力地促进了阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设，再一次打击了帝国主义和修正主义的野蛮封锁。
    自从去年十月，阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大的领袖霍查同志作了《关于协作和科技革命》的报告以来，阿尔巴尼亚广大职工遵照霍查同志的教导，掀起了一个热火朝天的、群众性的技术革新和合理化建议运动，并取得了显著成绩。到今年上半年，在阿尔巴尼亚全国新建了一百九十个作业线、车间和工厂，生产出了七百六十多种新设备、新机器和新产品。今年头八个月，费里区职工提出了二千七百项发明创造和合理化建议，其中一千二百五十项已付诸实施；同一期间，科尔察区职工提出了一千八百多项发明创造和合理化建议，其中一千三百多项已经实现。
    霍查同志在《关于协作和科技革命》的报告中指出：“象任何真正的革命一样，科学技术革命也将由广大人民群众和广大工人群众来进行。”地拉那、费里等许多工矿企业的职工根据这一指示，成立了新的技术设计室，吸收了许多工人和技术员参加，并在每个车间设立核心小组，具体负责讨论和实施各种建议。这样，就大大激发了工人们的积极性，使工厂中许多技术问题和工艺问题能更好更快地得到解决。
    地拉那汽车修配厂的革新者和合理化建议者经过多次试验，试制成功许多过去需要进口的汽车零件、配件和其它机器，改进了一部分产品的质量。与此同时，他们还建立了一个十人小组，以自力更生的精神建造了六部吊车，大大提高了劳动效率，减轻了工人们的劳动强度。地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂机修车间职工今年头八个月生产了三十八种过去需要进口的配件，这样，这个厂经常需要的配件约有百分之九十六已能自给。工人们决心再接再厉，今年内再生产五十六种新配件。费里地质公司职工在三个月的时间内，自力更生地制成了一种自动钻探机。都拉斯区职工也制成了三百二十吨水压机、起重能力达五吨的电动起重机和其它十种新的电器材料。卢比克炼铜厂的一位革新能手同厂内机械工人一起制造了一部洗矿机，从含铜量较低的褐土中提取了不少铜矿砂。
    许多职工通过技术革新和合理化建议的生产斗争实践，进一步增强了自力更生的信心，发扬了把集体利益置于个人利益之上的高尚品质，大大提高了社会主义的政治觉悟。同时，由于在革新运动中充分发挥集体的智慧和力量，技术人员和工人之间的联系和合作也更加密切了。
