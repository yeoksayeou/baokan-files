The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of liberation serfs — A record of the advanced deeds of the Shama border post in West Tibet in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, organizing the masses, and arming the masses

The Shama border post, stationed on the northern slopes of the Himalayas, is a red banner in the West Tibetan border defense forces' active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, and construction of political borders.

The Shama border soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. For over a decade, they have consistently propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, organized the masses, armed the masses, and united with the Tibetan people of Shama Village to jointly construct political borders.

Over a decade ago, the border soldiers, upon receiving orders from their superiors and the mandate of the entire nation, climbed over snow-capped mountains and waded through icy rivers to reach Shama Village. They saw that in this valley with a mild climate and fertile land, the serfs under the oppression and exploitation of the three great lords were in rags, hungry, and plagued by epidemics all year round, living in immense misery.

"The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting; apart from fighting to destroy the enemy's military power, it must also undertake the heavy tasks of propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses establish a revolutionary government, and even establishing Communist Party organizations." The soldiers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, with deep proletarian feelings for their Tibetan class brothers, determined to help their Tibetan class brothers shatter the heavy shackles that had been on their backs for thousands of years. They delivered portraits of Chairman Mao to the serfs, propagating that Chairman Mao is the great savior of the laboring people, the great leader of all ethnic groups, and that the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of all ethnic groups. They mobilized and helped the masses carry out democratic reforms. The border soldiers also helped the liberated serfs develop production and carried out medical and health work. A deep bond like fish and water was established between the soldiers and the people, guarding the national borders together.

The border soldiers deeply understood that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of border soldiers, the lifeline of all ethnic groups, and a powerful weapon for constructing political borders. They regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the masses as their sacred duty. Whenever the people of Shama Village passed by the border post to work in the fields, they would sit down to rest. The soldiers saw this as an opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and built three spacious rooms by the mountain path. They hung portraits of Chairman Mao on the white walls, posted Mao's quotations in Tibetan and Chinese, and slogans like "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They set up tables and chairs they made themselves, placing the golden Mao Zedong Thought books on them. Whenever the Tibetan people rested here, the soldiers would hand them cups of hot tea while propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the border soldiers promptly delivered Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the hearts of the masses. When Mao's instruction about "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes" reached the border, the border soldiers immediately helped Shama Village establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Initially, only youths and children participated, but later, elders and women also joined. In the study classes, the border soldiers and the masses together used their bloody family histories to denounce the "exploitation is beneficial" fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. The liberated serfs said: In the old society, we had no sky above and no land below, we couldn't look people straight in the eye, we couldn't walk with our heads held high, and we didn't even have the right to pick up a stone. The three great lords cruelly oppressed and exploited the serfs, but the Chinese Khrushchev blatantly said "exploitation is beneficial." This is completely sitting on the same cushion with the three great lords, eating from the same bowl. Their hearts are as black as the bottom of a pot; they are wolves in human skin.

The Tibetan deputy political instructor of the border post, Junwang, is an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought. The men, women, old, and young of Shama Village all know him because he often propagates Mao Zedong Thought throughout the village. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Junwang led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," delivering Chairman Mao's voice to the local masses. One night, the border soldiers heard from the radio the great news of Chairman Mao receiving the Central Office's Mao Zedong Thought study class members from Tibet. They braved the rain and rushed to Shama Village that night to tell the people. They also gave the masses many of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and Mao badges, making Mao quotation boards for the masses. In this remote mountain village, every family hung a portrait of Chairman Mao, every household had a Mao quotation board, and everyone wore a Mao badge on their chest. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" and the songs of Mao's quotations echoed through the valley. The Tibetan liberated serfs excitedly said, "Even if you give us a mountain of gold, it will eventually be used up; but if you give us Mao Zedong Thought, our descendants will be happy for generations."

The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of the Tibetan liberated serfs. The liberated serfs of Shama infinitely love the great leader Chairman Mao and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. They carry red flags and hold portraits of Chairman Mao when they go out to work. Once, the house of the liberated serf Quanjun caught fire, with smoke and flames billowing. Quanjun rushed back and, without caring for the grain or property, first took down the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the house. Later, when he rebuilt the house, Quanjun hung the portrait of Chairman Mao in the center of the new house. He excitedly said to the portrait of Chairman Mao, "Everything our family has is given by you, old man. With your wise leadership, we liberated serfs will definitely reach communism!" The people of Shama Village cannot do without Chairman Mao's books for a moment. Once, the liberated serf woman Jianze lost her Tibetan copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" by the river. She was so anxious that she searched everywhere and even wanted to go back to the river. Others said it was too far and dangerous, suggesting she go in the morning. Jianze was determined to find the precious book, saying, "Losing Chairman Mao's precious book is like losing everything! I must find Chairman Mao's precious book. I am not afraid of anything! I will traverse the snowy mountains and forests to find the precious book!" She lit a torch and walked tens of miles in the mountains that night, finally finding her most precious "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

The soldiers and people of Shama are united as one. Who can defeat us? The Shama border soldiers use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, establishing a solid political border. In 1962, during the self-defense counterattack by the border defense forces, the people of Shama Village stood guard, actively supported the frontline, helped the soldiers carry stretchers, transport ammunition, and deliver supplies, fighting alongside the soldiers to defeat the Indian aggressors. Now, the people of Shama, with heightened vigilance, guard the national borders with the border soldiers, ready to give the invading enemy a fatal blow at any moment. The young and strong of Shama Village practice drills with the border soldiers every day. Every household grinds tsampa, packs grain bags, prepares boots, and prepares stretchers, ready to respond to the call at any moment, coming and fighting to win. To ensure the border soldiers can fight at any time, the people of Shama Village never forget war preparedness day and night. During a flood season, the river washed away the bridge, and the men, women, old, and young of Shama Village mobilized to repair the bridge that night. There is a military telephone line passing through the forest in front of Shama Village. The people voluntarily maintain it, and if they find any problems with the line, they voluntarily fix it, ensuring the line's smooth operation over the years.

"The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the people." Although the Shama Valley is vast, it is not as great as the power of the Shama soldiers and people. Every blade of grass and tree on the border is familiar to them. No matter how cunning the class enemies are, they cannot escape the eyes of the Shama people. Once, a bad element attempting to sneak across the border disguised himself cleverly, but as soon as his foot touched the land of the Shama Valley, he was discovered by the liberated serfs armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers and people worked closely together to catch this guy.

The Shama border soldiers emphasize proletarian politics and, together with the local people, have built an iron gate on the Himalayas. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have made new contributions to the people of the motherland.

    毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照亮了翻身农奴的心
    ——记西藏沙马边防点用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的先进事迹
    坚守在喜马拉雅山北麓的沙马边防点，是西藏边防部队活学活用毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，建设政治边防的一面红旗。
    沙马边防战士无限忠于毛主席，他们十多年如一日，坚持用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，和沙马村的藏族人民团结一致，共同建设政治边防。
    十几年前，边防战士们奉上级命令，受全国人民的委托，爬过座座雪山，趟过条条冰河，来到沙马村的时候，他们看到在这座气候温和、土地肥沃的山谷里，农奴们在三大领主的剥削、压迫下，衣不遮体，食不饱腹，再加上瘟疫四季流行，真是痛苦不堪。
    “中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”战士们一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的伟大教导，怀着对藏族阶级兄弟无比深厚的无产阶级感情，决心帮助藏族阶级兄弟砸烂几千年来压在身上的沉重枷锁。他们把毛主席像送到农奴的手里，向群众宣传毛主席是劳动人民的大救星，是各族人民的伟大领袖，宣传光辉的毛泽东思想是各族人民的命根子，发动和帮助群众进行民主改革。边防战士们还帮助翻身农奴发展生产，开展医疗卫生工作。军民之间建立了鱼水般的情谊，一道守卫着祖国边疆。
    边防战士深深懂得，毛泽东思想是我们边防战士的命根子，是各族人民的命根子，是建设政治边防的强大武器。他们把向群众宣传毛泽东思想，当做自己神圣的职责。沙马村的群众每次下田劳动经过边防点时，都要坐下来休息一会。战士们觉得这是宣传毛泽东思想的好机会，便动手在山路旁修了三间宽敞的房屋，在洁白的墙上挂起了毛主席像，贴上藏、汉文的毛主席语录和“毛主席万岁！万万岁”的标语，摆起了自己制作的桌凳，上面放着金光闪闪的毛主席宝书。每当藏族人民在这里休息时，战士们就一边把一杯杯热茶递到群众手里，一边向他们宣传毛泽东思想。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，边防战士把毛主席的最新指示及时送到群众的心坎里。毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示传到边疆，边防战士立即帮助沙马村办起了毛泽东思想学习班。开始只有青年和儿童参加，后来老人、妇女都进了学习班。在学习班里，边防战士和群众一起，用血泪斑斑的家史，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”等谬论。翻身农奴说：在旧社会我们上无一片天，下无一块地，看人不准直眼看，走路不准抬着头，连拣块石头的权利都没有。三大领主对农奴进行残酷的压迫和剥削，而中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“剥削有功”。这完全是和三大领主坐在一个卡垫上，在一个碗里抓糌粑。他们的心象锅底一样黑，都是披着人皮的狼。
    边防点的藏族副指导员军旺，是活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。沙马村的男女老少都熟悉他，因为他经常给全村宣传毛泽东思想。在无产阶级文化大革命中，军旺带着毛泽东思想宣传组，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，把毛主席的声音传给当地群众。一天夜里，边防战士从收音机里听到了毛主席接见中央办的毛泽东思想学习班西藏班学员的特大喜讯，他们就冒着雨，连夜赶到沙马村，告诉群众。他们还送给群众很多毛主席的革命宝书和毛主席像章，为群众制作毛主席语录板。在这个偏僻山村里，家家挂着毛主席像，户户有毛主席语录牌，人人胸前佩戴着毛主席像章。“祝毛主席万寿无疆”的欢呼声，毛主席语录歌声，时时在山谷里回响。藏族翻身农奴激动地说：“送给我们一座金山，总有用完的一天；送给我们毛泽东思想，子孙万代幸福无边。”
    毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照亮了藏族翻身农奴的心。沙马的翻身农奴无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱光辉的毛泽东思想。他们出村劳动，都打上红旗，捧着毛主席像。有一次，翻身农奴绕君珠的房子失火了，烟火冲天。绕君珠赶回来冲进屋里，顾不得粮食，顾不得财产，首先把挂在屋里的毛主席像捧出来。后来新盖了房子，绕君珠又把毛主席像悬挂在新屋的中央。他对着毛主席像激动地说：“我们全家的一切都是您老人家给的，有您老人家的英明领导，我们翻身农奴一定走到共产主义！”沙马村群众一时一刻也离不开毛主席的宝书。有一次，翻身女农奴兼则在界河边上劳动回来，晚上回到家里才发现藏文的《毛主席语录》丢了。她急得四处寻找，还要到界河边去找。别人说离界河太远了，又危险，天明再去吧。兼则下定决心要找回宝书，她说：“丢掉毛主席的宝书就是丢掉一切！要找回毛主席宝书，我什么也不怕！踏遍雪山、走遍山林一定要找回宝书！”她打起火把，连夜走了十几里山路，终于找回了她最珍贵的《毛主席语录》。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？沙马边防战士用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，建立起巩固的政治边防。一九六二年边防部队进行自卫反击战时，沙马村人民站岗放哨，积极支援前线，帮助子弟兵抬担架，运子弹，送粮草，和子弟兵一道，打败了印度侵略者。现在，沙马人民又百倍警惕地和边防战士一道，守卫着祖国边防，时刻准备给予来犯的敌人以致命的打击。沙马村的青壮年，每天起床后都和边防战士一样出操练武。家家户户都磨好糌粑，装好粮袋，备下胶鞋，准备好担架，只待一声令下，就召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜。为了保证边防战士能随时投入战斗，沙马村的群众日夜不忘战备。一个洪水季节，河水把桥冲断了，沙马村男女老少齐动员，连夜把桥修好。有一条军用电话线，穿过沙马村前的森林，群众就主动维护，发现线路出了毛病就主动去修，几年来，保证了线路的畅通。
    “战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”沙马山谷虽大，没有沙马军民的神通大。边防上的一草一木，他们都了如指掌，阶级敌人无论多么狡猾，也逃不过沙马人民的眼睛。有一次，一个企图偷越国境的坏分子，挖空心思，乔装打扮，但当他的脚刚踏上沙马山谷的土地，就被用毛泽东思想武装起来的翻身农奴发现了。军民密切合作，抓住了这个家伙。
    沙马边防战士突出无产阶级政治，和当地群众一起在喜马拉雅山筑起了钢铁门户，在无产阶级文化大革命中为祖国人民立下了新功。
