Workers of Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 6 Shoulder the Dual Burdens of Revolution and Production
Support the Worker Propaganda Teams in Seizing the Educational Battlefield with Practical Actions

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 11 — The broad revolutionary workers of Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 6, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, with the high sense of responsibility that the working class is the leading class, bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. They supported the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in seizing the educational battlefield with practical actions. After sending a batch of excellent workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter schools, the revolution in this mill has become even more vigorous, and production has become even more lively. In August, they overfulfilled the production tasks, with cotton yarn exceeding the quota by more than 800 pieces and cotton cloth by more than 80,000 meters. Various production indicators have shown significant increases compared to July. By early September, production levels had further improved compared to August.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 6 in October last year, they have followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and made remarkable achievements in the work of revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, and rectification. After receiving the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the workers' representatives from the capital and Chairman Mao's latest instructions that the working class is the leading class, the entire mill was filled with joy. Revolutionary workers immediately selected excellent workers with rich experience in class struggle and who had bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Under the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, they entered universities and units that had not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. At the same time, the workers who remained in the factory all expressed: they would not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's concern, trust, and sincere expectations for the working class. They were determined to grasp the revolution and promote production, immediately launching a new high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production and struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory, and supporting the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams with practical actions.

To quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committee of this mill and various workshops and teams held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and organized various forms of lectures on the practical application of Mao Zedong Thought. They further deepened the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. They followed Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further deepened the revolutionary criticism, and combined it with the work of cleaning up class ranks, rectification, and streamlining organizations. They launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation that was both vigorous and solid.

At the same time, the broad revolutionary workers, with high political enthusiasm and production initiative, launched a new production high tide throughout the factory. Since late August, reports of new records created by various workshops and teams have been frequent. The B shift of the fine spinning workshop proposed the bold slogan of "reducing people to increase production, one person doing the work of several." In the face of fewer people and heavier tasks, they not only completed their own tasks well but also sent people to support other teams. Many workshops also launched competitions for revolution spinning, revolution weaving, and revolution repairing machines. The workers in the fine spinning workshop who repair machines, after sending people to participate in the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, redoubled their efforts. They often used their rest time to repair machines, creating a new record for machine repairs since the factory's establishment, and creating conditions for increasing the production and improving the quality of fine yarn. The revolutionary workers of this mill also widely carried out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, determined to achieve greater results, and report good news to the class brothers participating in the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, so that they can concentrate on participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    郑州国棉六厂广大革命工人挑起革命生产两副重担
    用实际行动支持工人宣传队占领教育阵地
    新华社郑州十一日电　郑州国棉六厂广大革命工人，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“工人阶级是领导阶级”的高度责任感，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，用实际行动支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队占领学校阵地。这个厂在抽出一批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校的情况下，本厂的革命搞得更加轰轰烈烈，生产更加热气腾腾，八月份超额完成了生产任务，其中棉纱超额八百多件，棉布超额八万多米，各项生产指标都比七月份有大幅度增长。九月初比八月份的生产水平又有显著提高。
    郑州国棉六厂的革命职工去年十月成立革命委员会以来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党等项工作中，都作出了显著成绩。伟大领袖毛主席接见首都工人代表的喜讯和毛主席关于工人阶级是领导阶级的最新指示传来以后，全厂一片欢腾，广大革命工人立即挑选出有丰富阶级斗争经验和在无产阶级文化大革命中英勇捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的优秀工人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，在省、市革命委员会的统一领导下，进驻大学和没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。在这同时，留在工厂的工人纷纷表示：决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的关怀、信任和殷切期望，决心狠抓革命，猛促生产，立即在全厂掀起抓革命促生产和斗、批、改的新高潮，以实际行动作工人毛泽东思想宣传队的坚强后盾。
    为了迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，这个厂的革委会和各车间、班组分别举行了毛泽东思想学习班，召开了各种形式的活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，进一步深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。他们遵照毛主席的一系列最新指示，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，并把大批判同清理阶级队伍和整党、精简机构等项工作结合起来，既轰轰烈烈、又扎扎实实地掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    在这同时，广大革命工人以饱满的政治热情和生产积极性，在全厂掀起了生产新高潮。八月下旬以来，各车间和小组创造新纪录的捷报频传。细纱车间丙班五组提出了“减人要增产，一人顶几人”的豪迈口号，他们在人少任务重的情况下，不但很好地完成了本组的任务，而且还抽出人支援其他组。很多车间还开展了为革命纺纱、为革命织布、为革命修理机器的竞赛。细纱车间维修机器的工人们，在抽人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队以后，干劲倍增，经常利用休息时间检修机器，创造了建厂以来检修机器的新纪录，为增加细纱的产量和提高质量创造了条件。这个厂的革命工人，还广泛开展技术革新和技术革命活动，决心作出更大的成绩，向参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的阶级兄弟报喜，让他们安心参加学校的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
