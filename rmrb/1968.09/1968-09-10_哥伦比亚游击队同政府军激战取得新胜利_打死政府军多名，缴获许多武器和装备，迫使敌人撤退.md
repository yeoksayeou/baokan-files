The guerrillas active in the Alto Sinú region in northwestern Colombia recently engaged in a fierce battle with the reactionary government forces and achieved a new victory.

A bulletin issued by the guerrillas, composed of revolutionary peasants and workers from Colombia, stated that the guerrillas had achieved significant victories in their struggle against the local tyrants and government forces.

The bulletin said that the government forces mobilized thousands of soldiers from the north and south to launch an attack on the guerrillas. The guerrillas resisted this attack in about twenty places and defeated the government forces in many areas.

The guerrillas also launched coordinated attacks in several places, including Icuanango and Gallinaza, killing many government soldiers, seizing a large number of weapons and equipment, and forcing the government forces to retreat. Dozens of bandits serving the reactionary government were eliminated or captured. The guerrillas further developed during the struggle.

According to another report, on August 25, this guerrilla force ambushed a government patrol in a rural area in northern Colombia, killing five government soldiers. At the end of July, this guerrilla force ambushed another government patrol in the Davivienda mountains of Antioquia Province, killing and wounding many government soldiers, including a captain.

    新华社九日讯　波哥大消息：活跃在哥伦比亚西北部阿尔托西努地区的游击队，最近同反动的政府军队进行了英勇的战斗，取得了新的胜利。

    公报说，政府军调动数千名士兵从南北两面对游击队发动进攻，游击队在大约二十个地方抗击了这次进攻，并在很多地方击败了政府军。
    游击队还在伊困安戈、加利兰亚等几个地方发动协同作战，打死政府军多人，缴获许多武器和装备，迫使政府军撤退。数十名为反动政府效劳的土匪被消灭或被抓了起来。游击队在斗争中又得到了发展。
