The Malayan Socialist Front recently issued a statement firmly supporting the brave hunger strike of political prisoners in Muar and Taiping concentration camps. The statement strongly condemns the fascist atrocities committed by the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime in persecuting political prisoners.

The statement says: "The hunger strike by the political detainees is right and well done. Their struggle against persecution exposes the fascist nature of the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime and encourages and inspires the anti-imperialist struggle of the Malayan people."

The statement points out that for a long time, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime has not stopped persecuting the Malayan people, especially anti-imperialist patriots. Recently, they have even more cruelly persecuted workers, farmers, fishermen, street vendors, taxi drivers, and people from all walks of life, even attempting to kill more than a dozen anti-imperialist patriotic youths. Countless outstanding sons and daughters of Malaya have been arrested, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or killed by American and British imperialism and their Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime. The facts show that American and British imperialism and their puppet regimes are the sworn enemies of the Malayan people and must be resolutely overthrown!

The statement further points out: "The hunger strike by political detainees in Muar and Taiping concentration camps has foiled the plots of the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime. Imperialism and all reactionaries always scheme to sabotage, obstruct, and extinguish the revolutionary masses' anti-imperialist struggle. Their savage persecution and torture of political detainees are part of their plot to make them surrender. However, the people's struggle continues, and although the political detainees are imprisoned, they have not abandoned their anti-imperialist struggle and political ideals. All of this fully proves the failure of the reactionaries' plots. Objective reality is not subject to the will of imperialism and reactionaries."

The statement emphasizes: "The hunger strike by political detainees is just. The Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime must immediately accept their reasonable demands and guarantee their safety. Political detainees are innocent. The Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime must immediately stop the persecution and unconditionally release them!"

The statement concludes by calling on the Malayan people to "unite, organize, and mobilize to fight for national liberation, persist in the struggle, and strive for victory!"

    马来亚社会主义阵线谴责拉赫曼李光耀傀儡政权迫害政治犯
    美英帝国主义及其走狗是马来亚人民的死敌
    新华社讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚社会主义阵线最近发表声明，坚决支持麻坡和华都牙也集中营的政治犯英勇的绝食斗争。声明严厉谴责拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权野蛮迫害政治犯的法西斯暴行。
    声明说：“政治拘留者的绝食斗争，做得对，干得好。他们的反迫害斗争暴露了拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权的法西斯本质，声援和鼓舞了马来亚人民的反帝斗争。”
    声明说，长期以来，拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权一直没有停止过迫害马来亚人民，特别是反帝爱国志士。近来，他们更变本加厉地残酷迫害工人、农民、渔民、小贩、载客汽车司机和各阶层人民，甚至企图杀害十几名反帝爱国青年。无数马来亚优秀的儿女，惨遭美英帝国主义及其拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权逮捕、监禁、殴打、虐待或者杀害。事实说明，美英帝国主义及其走狗政权，是马来亚人民的死敌，必须坚决打倒！
    声明接着指出：“麻坡和华都牙也集中营政治拘留者的绝食斗争，粉碎了拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权的阴谋诡计。帝国主义和一切反动派总是处心积虑，妄图破坏、阻止和扑灭革命群众的反帝斗争，他们野蛮迫害和虐待政治拘留者就是阴谋使他们屈服。但是，人民群众的斗争仍旧继续下去，而政治拘留者虽然被监禁，也没有放弃他们的反帝斗争和政治理想。所有这一切充分地证明了反动派的阴谋的破产。客观现实是不以帝国主义和反动派的意志为转移的。”
    声明强调说：“政治拘留者的绝食斗争是正义的。拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权必须立即接受他们的合理要求，保证他们的生命安全。政治拘留者无罪。拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权必须立即停止迫害和无条件地释放他们！”
    声明最后号召马来亚人民“团结起来，组织起来，动员起来，为争取民族解放，坚持斗争，直至胜利！”
