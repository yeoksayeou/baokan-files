Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the warm care of the proletarian headquarters, the revolutionary committee of the Capital Steel Company has been born in glory.

The New China News Agency reports on the 13th: Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the warm care of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and in the great day when the whole country is red, the revolutionary committee of the Capital Steel Company has been born in glory.

This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is also a new contribution made by the broad masses of steel workers of the Capital Steel Company in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and a great achievement made by the People's Liberation Army on the "three-in-one" and "two-military" fronts.

The Capital Steel Company is an enterprise with a history of half a century, having experienced the reactionary rule of the Beiyang warlords, Japanese imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, through their agents, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the Capital Steel Company. They recruited and accommodated traitors, formed cliques, and turned the Capital Steel Company into an independent kingdom where needles could not be inserted and water could not be poured in. The Chinese Khrushchev personally took charge, carefully cultivating this plot of land for the restoration of capitalism. Since liberation, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines here has been extremely sharp, complex, and intense.

The joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao personally receiving the representatives of the working class of the capital and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle" have blown into the Capital Steel Company like a strong east wind, moistening the hearts of the steel workers. With their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the workers, with a high sense of political responsibility and selfless heroism of the working class, took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon and launched a general offensive against the "old, big, and difficult" problems. After more than twenty days of struggle, the whole company achieved a red tide, and the revolutionary committee of the Capital Steel Company was born in glory, marking the arrival of a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The PLA support-left personnel stationed in the Capital Steel Company, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," with deep proletarian feelings, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, day and night, spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every workshop and every team, so that every class brother could hear Chairman Mao's great voice in time. They also used holidays to climb mountains and valleys to visit families, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers, recall bitterness and sweetness, have heart-to-heart talks, and do in-depth, detailed, and arduous political and ideological work. For places where a few bad elements temporarily held the upper hand, bad people were rampant, and good people were suppressed, the support-left personnel concentrated their forces, formed a powerful propaganda army, and marched in with great fanfare, vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, creating a strong political offensive, quickly suppressing evil with good, making people with different views see through the plot of a handful of class enemies to split the ranks of the working class, and uniting the broad masses of revolutionary workers to fight against the enemy together.

In the process of achieving great unity and the three-in-one combination, the broad masses of revolutionary workers of the Capital Steel Company experienced extremely sharp and intense class struggles. A handful of class enemies incited and utilized bourgeois factionalism, setting up numerous obstacles and creating various fallacies, attempting to obstruct and sabotage the great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The broad masses of revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought smashed their plots and tricks, set up revolutionary criticism and struggle battlefields everywhere, and thoroughly criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center means no center" theory. The workers said: We workers can only hold high one banner, which is to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; there can only be one faction within the working class, which is the revolutionary faction of the proletariat; there can only be one center in the hearts of the workers, which is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Only under the battle orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters can we unify our thoughts, steps, and actions, and fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work.

Iron water flows, steel flowers splash, red flags flutter under the Xishan Mountain, and the Capital Steel Company is dressed in festive attire. On September 10th, at the celebration meeting for the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Capital Steel Company, drums and gongs resounded, and songs echoed. More than ten thousand steel workers, holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sincerely wished the great teacher of the working class, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Responsible comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality and the Beijing Garrison attended the celebration meeting and spoke.

The Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, representatives attending the metallurgical industry conference, and revolutionary workers from various sister factories and mines in Beijing all came to congratulate.

Those who participated in the establishment and celebration meeting of the Capital Steel Company Revolutionary Committee also included representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, the Beijing Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards of higher education institutions, and the Red Guards of middle schools.

At the celebration meeting, all revolutionary workers solemnly swore: We will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will ensure that every latest instruction of Chairman Mao and every battle order of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin can be promptly and smoothly implemented. The chairman of the Capital Steel Company Revolutionary Committee, military representative Guo Yingchun, spoke at the celebration meeting, expressing that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the whole company to a new high tide. We will carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and their agents in the Capital Steel Company. We will do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office personnel. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work, we will fully give play to the leading role of the working class and turn the Capital Steel Company into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下　在无产阶级司令部亲切关怀下
    首都钢铁公司革命委员会光荣诞生
    广大革命职工在解放军帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速解决了“老大难”问题，全公司实现了一片红
    新华社十三日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在全国山河一片红的大喜日子里，首都钢铁公司革命委员会光荣诞生了。
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这也是首钢广大钢铁工人紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署做出的新贡献，是中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”战线上取得的又一伟大成就。
    首都钢铁公司，是个具有半个世纪历史的企业，经历了北洋军阀、日本帝国主义、国民党反动派的反动统治。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团通过他们的代理人，在首钢竭力推行了反革命修正主义路线。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，把首钢搞成一个针插不进，水泼不进的独立王国。中国赫鲁晓夫还亲自出马，苦心经营这块复辟资本主义的“试验田”。解放以来，这里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争极其尖锐、复杂、激烈。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自接见首都工人阶级代表的喜讯和毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”最新指示的发表，象一股强劲的东风，吹进了首钢，滋润了钢铁工人的心。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，以工人阶级高度的政治责任感和大公无私的英雄气概，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，向“老大难”发起了总攻。经过二十多天的奋战，全公司实现了一片红，首都钢铁公司革命委员会光荣诞生，一个斗、批、改的高潮到来了。
    驻首钢的人民解放军支左人员，遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，用最大的热情，最快的速度，不分昼夜地把毛主席的最新指示，传播到每个车间，每个班组，让每个阶级兄弟都能及时听到毛主席的伟大声音。他们还利用假日，翻山越岭进行家庭访问，同工人一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，促膝谈心，进行深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作。对于少数歪风邪气一时占了上风，坏人猖狂，好人受气的地方，解放军支左人员集中力量，组成强大的宣传大军，浩浩荡荡地开进去，大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，造成强大的政治攻势，使正气迅速压倒邪气，使有不同观点的群众识破一小撮阶级敌人妄图分裂工人阶级队伍的阴谋，使广大革命职工联合起来，共同对敌。
    在实现革命大联合和革命三结合的过程中，首钢广大革命职工经历了极其尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争。一小撮阶级敌人煽动和利用资产阶级派性，设置重重障碍，制造种种谬论，妄图阻挠、破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，粉碎了他们的阴谋诡计，到处摆下了革命大批判的战场，把反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，批得臭不可闻。工人们说：我们工人阶级只能高举一面旗帜，这就是要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；工人阶级内部只能是一派，这就是无产阶级革命派；工人阶级心中只有一个中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。我们只有在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，才能充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。
    铁水奔流，钢花飞溅，石景山下红旗招展，首钢披上了节日的盛装。九月十日，在庆祝首都钢铁公司革命委员会成立的大会上，锣鼓喧天，歌声嘹亮，一万多名钢铁工人手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，衷心祝愿工人阶级的伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    北京市革命委员会和北京卫戍区负责同志出席了庆祝大会，并讲了话。
    北京工人毛泽东思想宣传队、出席冶金工业会议的代表以及北京市各兄弟厂矿革命职工代表都前来祝贺。
    参加首钢革委会成立和庆祝大会的，还有北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中学红代会的代表。
    在庆祝大会上，全体革命职工庄严宣誓：永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。保证把毛主席的每一个最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都能迅速地畅通地贯彻执行。首都钢铁公司革命委员会主任、军队代表郭应春在庆祝大会上讲话表示，革命委员会成立以后，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把全公司活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新高潮。要深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团以及他们在首钢的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。搞好清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等项工作。在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，把首钢办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
