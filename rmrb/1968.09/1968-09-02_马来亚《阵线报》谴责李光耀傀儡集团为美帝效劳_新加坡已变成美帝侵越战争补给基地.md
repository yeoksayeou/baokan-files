Newspaper "Jiefangbao" published in Singapore recently published an article denouncing the Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime for turning Singapore into a supply base for American imperialist aggression.

The article states that the recent foreign trade figures released by the Singapore authorities show that in May of this year, South Vietnam was the leading destination for Singapore's exports, amounting to over 30 million Singapore dollars, an increase of 17 million dollars from the same month last year, and an increase of 96 million dollars from the same month in 1966. The majority of Singapore's exports to South Vietnam are military supplies for the American aggressor forces, such as steel plates, steel, metal containers, building materials, petroleum products, and photographic equipment. The American imperialists have even ordered patrol boats from a shipyard in Singapore.

The article points out that the Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime has been using the so-called "neutrality" banner to deceive people everywhere, and in the issue of the American war in Vietnam, it has been vigorously advocating "maintaining neutrality." However, the fact that the Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime has turned Singapore into a supply base for the American war in Vietnam, and its brutal suppression of the Malayan revolutionary people's support for the Vietnamese people's resistance against American aggression, has exposed its ugly face of opposing the Vietnamese people and collaborating with American imperialism.

    马来亚《阵线报》谴责李光耀傀儡集团为美帝效劳
    新加坡已变成美帝侵越战争补给基地
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近发表文章，谴责李光耀傀儡集团把新加坡变成美帝国主义侵略战争的补给基地。
    文章说，新加坡当局最近发表的对外贸易数字表明，在新加坡今年五月份的输出中，以南越居首位，价值三千多万元（新加坡币），比去年同月份增加了一百七十多万元，比一九六六年同月份增加了九百六十多万元。新加坡对南越所输出的大都是供给美国侵略军的军事物资，如钢板、钢、金属容器、建筑材料、石油产品和照相器材等。美帝甚至向设在新加坡的一家造船厂订造巡逻艇。
    文章指出，李光耀傀儡集团一直打着所谓“中立”的招牌，到处招摇撞骗，在美帝侵越战争问题上，又极力标榜“保持中立”。可是，李光耀傀儡集团把新加坡变成美帝侵越战争的补给基地的事实和它对马来亚革命人民的援越抗美运动进行的残酷镇压，赤裸裸地暴露了它反对越南人民和投靠美帝国主义的丑恶面目。
