Last September, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the regions south of the Yangtze River, personally visiting Hunan, and issued a series of new instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This was the greatest encouragement, the greatest care, the greatest education, and the greatest spur for us. The struggle over the past year has fully proven that every teaching of Chairman Mao is our beacon, guiding us to victory. In the course of the battle, we deeply felt that following Chairman Mao is victory. Fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of new instructions will definitely enable us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

As we celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, we joyfully shout and sing, sincerely wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

In his new instructions, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit. It must be resolved." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we quickly put the issue of correctly handling cadres and helping cadres to come forward on the extremely important agenda. However, at that time, because thorough and detailed ideological work was not carried out, some cadres and masses had many concerns. Some cadres, because they had executed the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes to varying degrees in the early stages of the movement, were criticized by the masses and could not understand it for a while; some were afraid of making mistakes again and dared not come forward to work. Some revolutionary masses were concerned that cadres coming forward would retaliate. A few people influenced by ultra-leftist thinking still held doubts about cadres. Therefore, the work of liberating cadres progressed very slowly. At this time, a handful of class enemies were secretly pleased and stirred up trouble.

Facing this situation, the workers of the entire factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, immediately launched a high tide of studying, publicizing, and implementing Chairman Mao's new instructions throughout the factory. Based on the active thoughts of some cadres and masses, we held four sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes around the issue of liberating cadres. We insisted on using "criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism" as the guideline, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and his series of new instructions. We repeatedly educated cadres to correctly handle relations with the masses and with themselves, not to rely on past merits, but to create new achievements. At the same time, we repeatedly educated the masses to correctly handle relations with cadres, emphasizing that they must listen to Chairman Mao's words: "The vast majority of cadres are good, only a very few are not good." "Cadres' problems should be addressed through education, expanding the scope of education." Chairman Mao's instructions untied the knots in the minds of cadres and masses. We also organized cadres to visit the place where the red sun rises—Shaoshan—to learn from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, giving them a very profound education. Many cadres, in their self-criticism meetings, exposed their selfish thoughts, compared themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings, and felt very ashamed. They said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us, and we really let him down." They expressed their determination to come forward to work and follow Chairman Mao in revolution forever. They seriously reviewed their mistakes, actively exposed the problems of capitalist roaders, and went among the masses to listen to criticism.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's new instructions, the broad revolutionary masses, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, carefully discussed and studied each cadre based on their entire history and work, as well as their performance in the Cultural Revolution. Many revolutionary masses, after raising their awareness, warmly welcomed and firmly supported the various revolutionary actions of cadres coming forward actively. The work of liberating cadres in the entire factory developed rapidly. There were 177 middle-level and above cadres in the factory. Before Chairman Mao's inspection of Hunan, only 13% were liberated. After Chairman Mao's inspection, in a short period of time, 72% were liberated.

The liberation of a large number of cadres greatly promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the entire factory. By the end of September last year, the entire factory achieved a revolutionary great alliance and established a workers' congress; by the end of November, based on the establishment of revolutionary committees in all primary units, a factory revolutionary committee was established. Revolutionary leading cadres were combined in all levels of revolutionary committees.

A large number of revolutionary cadres participating in the three-in-one combination power organs played a significant role in promoting the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire factory, advancing production, and various other works. The former factory director and first secretary of the party committee, Sun Jingming (now the chairman of the factory revolutionary committee), and other revolutionary leading cadres, after participating in the revolutionary committee, stood firmly with the proletarian revolutionary masses, using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, smashed the attacks from the right and the ultra-left by a handful of class enemies, and consolidated the revolutionary committee. The forging workshop had a deputy director who, in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, executed the bourgeois reactionary line and made serious mistakes. He thought that the masses no longer trusted him. Later, after the masses discussed it, they learned that he was a cadre with over 30 years of work experience, of worker origin, with a good nature, and had a correct understanding of his mistakes. Everyone unanimously elected him as the director of the workshop revolutionary committee. He was very moved. After his election, he worked very actively, dared to take on heavy responsibilities, insisted on principles, and patiently did ideological and political work, deeply appreciated by the masses. The locomotive workshop had more heavy and dirty work. The revolutionary committee cadres took the lead in participating in labor in this workshop, leaving a good impression among the masses. With the continuous consolidation and development of the revolutionary committees, the entire factory saw a high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers continuously improved, the political atmosphere was unprecedentedly strong, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of people. The movement of "grasp revolution, promote production" also saw a new high tide.

At present, all revolutionary workers in our factory are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a vigorous wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance with victory, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of new instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席关于干部问题的指示威力无穷
    湖南株洲田心机车工厂革命委员会
    去年九月，我们伟大领袖毛主席视察大江南北，亲临湖南，对无产阶级文化大革命作出了一系列的最新指示。这对我们是最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，最大的教育，最大的鞭策。一年来的斗争实践充分证明：毛主席的每一教导，都是我们前进的灯塔，指引着胜利的航程。在战斗的历程中，我们深刻地体会到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，就一定能够夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    当我们欢庆伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区一周年的时候，我们纵情高呼，放声歌唱，衷心祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席在最新指示中，明确指出：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”遵照毛主席的教导，我们迅速把正确对待干部、帮助干部站出来的问题，提到了非常重要的议事日程上来。但是，当时由于深入细致的思想工作没有跟上去，部分干部和群众的思想顾虑较多。有的干部因为在运动初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了不同程度的错误，受到了群众批判，一时想不通；有的怕再犯错误，不敢站出来工作。一些革命群众，担心干部站出来后，打击报复。极少数受到极“左”思潮影响的人，还对干部抱着怀疑的态度。因此，解放干部的工作，进展十分缓慢。这时，一小撮阶级敌人，却暗中高兴，兴风作浪。
    针对这一情况，全厂工人群众，在人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，立即在全厂范围内掀起了学习、宣传、落实毛主席最新指示的高潮。根据一部分干部和群众的活思想，围绕解放干部问题，我们先后举办了四期毛泽东思想学习班，坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，组织大家学习毛主席著作和一系列最新指示，反复教育干部要正确对待群众，正确对待自己，不要吃老本，要立新功。同时，反复教育群众正确对待干部，一定要听毛主席的话：“绝大多数的干部都是好的，不好的只是极少数。”“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面。”毛主席的指示，解开了干部和群众的思想疙瘩。我们还组织干部到红太阳升起的地方——韶山去参观，学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，使他们受到了极其深刻的教育。许多干部在斗私批修会上，亮出自己的私心，对照毛主席的谆谆教导，感到十分痛心。他们说：“毛主席这样关心我们，我们实在对不起毛主席。”表示要站出来工作，紧跟毛主席永远闹革命。他们认真检讨了自己的错误，积极揭发走资派的问题，并到群众中听取批评意见。
    广大革命群众在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，按照毛主席的教导，根据干部的全部历史和工作以及在文化大革命中的表现，一个一个地认真进行了讨论研究。许多革命群众在提高认识以后，对干部积极主动地站出来的各种革命行动，表示了热烈的欢迎和坚决的支持。全厂解放干部的工作，迅速发展。全厂中层以上干部一百七十七人，毛主席视察湖南以前，仅解放百分之十三，毛主席视察以后，在不长的时间内，就解放了百分之七十二。
    大批干部的解放，大大促进了全厂革命的大联合和革命的三结合。去年九月底，全厂实现了革命的大联合，成立了工代会；十一月底，在基层单位全部成立了革命委员会的基础上，成立了厂革命委员会。在各级革命委员会中，都结合了革命领导干部。
    大批革命干部参加了三结合的权力机构，对于推动全厂无产阶级文化大革命，促进生产以及各项工作，发挥了显著的作用。原厂长兼党委第一副书记孙敬明（现任厂革委会主任）等革命领导干部参加革命委员会后，紧紧和无产阶级革命派站在一起，以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人来自右的和极“左”方面的进攻，巩固了革命委员会。锻冶车间有一个副主任，文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了严重的错误。他认为再没有群众信任自己了，后来群众一讨论，了解到他是一个有三十多年工龄、老工人出身的干部，本质好，对错误有认识，大家一致选他当了车间革委会主任，他非常感动。他当选后，工作特别积极，敢于挑重担，坚持原则，耐心做思想政治工作，深受群众的赞扬。机车车间的重活、脏活较多，革委会的干部便带头到这个车间参加劳动，在群众中留下了良好的影响。随着革命委员会的不断巩固和发展，全厂出现了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动高潮，广大工人群众阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟不断提高，政治空气空前浓厚，大大促进了人的思想革命化。抓革命、促生产也出现了新的高潮。
    目前，我厂全体革命职工，正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在全厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的斗、批、改高潮。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
