Albania's broad livestock industry workers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, emphasizing politics, adhering to the socialist path, and achieving remarkable results in the development of livestock production.

After the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, a vigorous wave of agricultural collectivization swept across the mountainous regions of the country. In less than three months, the remaining non-collectivized mountainous rural areas swiftly established agricultural production cooperatives, successfully achieving nationwide agricultural collectivization. Subsequently, the members of the agricultural production cooperatives, in the process of further revolutionizing people's thoughts, proposed various initiatives, such as voluntarily reducing personal livestock, handing over their draft cattle, dairy cows, calves, and pack animals to the cooperatives, and so on. At the same time, some regions proposed initiatives to further exchange experiences through mutual visits by livestock industry cadres. These initiatives received widespread support from cooperative members across the country, significantly promoting the development of livestock production.

In recent years, cattle breeding in Albania has seen significant development. Currently, the total number of cattle nationwide has increased by 43 percent compared to 1938. Since the Albanian Party of Labour Central Committee issued the decision to vigorously develop dairy cows nationwide last November, cattle breeding has further developed. For instance, 42 agricultural production cooperatives in Kukes District have established cattle barns, and all agricultural cooperatives in Elbasan District have started raising dairy cows.

Meanwhile, the broad livestock industry workers have also conducted extensive work in improving sheep breeds. Currently, nearly all 90,000 sheep raised in state farms have been improved, with each sheep producing an average of 2.5 kilograms of wool per year. In the past, Albania often had to import some high-quality sheep breeds from abroad. Now, this situation has changed. This year, Albania's domestically produced high-quality sheep breeds can meet the needs of various regions.

Currently, the broad livestock industry workers are actively responding to the call of the Party and the government, mobilizing extensively, rationally arranging manpower and resources, seizing the favorable opportunity to build cattle sheds, construct livestock barns, repair sheep pens, and prepare winter feed, creating more favorable conditions for the further development of livestock production next year.

    阿尔巴尼亚畜牧业生产取得显著成就
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚广大畜牧业劳动者，积极响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，突出政治，坚持走社会主义道路，在发展畜牧业生产方面，取得了显著的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会以后，在全国山区掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的农业集体化高潮，不到三个月，尚未集体化的山区农村迅速地建立起农业生产合作社，胜利地实现了全国农业集体化。随后，广大农业生产合作社社员，在促进人的思想进一步革命化过程中，提出各种倡议，如主动减少自留牲畜，把自己的耕牛、奶牛、牛犊和驮载牲口上交给合作社等。同时，一些区提出了通过畜牧业干部的互访进一步交流经验的倡议。这些倡议得到全国各地农业社社员的普遍响应，大大促进了畜牧业的发展。
    近年来，牛的饲养在阿尔巴尼亚有了较大的发展。目前全国牛的总头数比一九三八年增加了百分之四十三。自从去年十一月阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央公布在全国大力发展母牛的决定以后，牛的饲养得到了进一步发展，仅库克斯区就有四十二个农业生产合作社建立了牛厩，爱尔塞卡区的所有农业合作社都开始饲养母牛。
    与此同时，广大畜牧业劳动者在改良羊的品种方面也进行了大量的工作。目前各国营农场饲养的九万头羊几乎全部经过改良，每头羊平均年产羊毛二点五公斤。过去阿尔巴尼亚经常要向外国进口一些优良羊种，现在这种情况已经改变。今年阿尔巴尼亚自产的优良羊种，已能满足各地的需要。
    目前，广大畜牧业劳动者正在积极响应劳动党和政府的号召，广泛动员起来，合理安排人力物力，抓紧良好时机盖牛棚，建畜厩，修羊圈，准备过冬饲料，为明年畜牧业的进一步发展创造更有利的条件。
