Red flags flutter in the night breeze, and firecrackers echo through the night sky. Beijing Chemical Plant No. 3 is in a state of joyous excitement. People are rushing around, spreading the news and celebrating the great joyous tidings of a nationwide sea of red. A team of messengers heads to Zhongnanhai to report the good news to Chairman Mao, shouting in unison for the country's mountains and rivers to be entirely red.

The comrades of the sulfur group saw off the messengers but their excited hearts could not calm down. They all thought: On this joyous day, what should we do? A worker said, "This is a major political event for the people of the entire nation. Let's put up a blackboard newspaper to express our feelings, so that more people can know this joyous news tomorrow and spread the thoughts of Mao Zedong." His words struck a chord with everyone. They immediately got to work, cutting out a colored portrait of Chairman Mao, and finding colored pencils, they rushed to the propaganda board.

There were no lights around the propaganda board, so how could they write or draw? Yes, that was a problem. Should they wait until tomorrow? No. They were determined to immediately spread this great joyous news and celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. A young female worker said, "We can use flashlights to see and definitely put up a new blackboard newspaper tonight!" Her suggestion was met with unanimous approval.

The workers of this small group have an infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They follow Chairman Mao's words and closely follow his great strategic deployments. When Chairman Mao called for "revolutionizing and promoting production," they completed in six days what used to take a month. When Chairman Mao called for "seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," they fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, refuting their "pressure turns into motive force" theory that was used to oppress the workers. While criticizing the "expert-led factory," they boldly improved the technology, shortened the production cycle, and greatly increased production efficiency. The worker comrades said, "We studied Chairman Mao's works and felt our strength was especially great."

In the dead of night, with infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao, they used the dim light of flashlights to carefully paste the portrait of Chairman Mao on the blackboard. Around Chairman Mao's portrait, they drew the radiant light of the red sun. To express their eternal loyalty to the red sun, they carefully drew sunflowers facing the sun. Under the sunflowers facing the sun, they wrote about the working class's joyous celebration of the country's mountains and rivers being entirely red, their wishes for Chairman Mao's longevity, and their determination to liberate Taiwan...

    深夜编喜报
    红旗在夜风中飘扬，鞭炮在夜空中震响。北京化工三厂一片欢腾，人们奔走相告，传颂全国一片红的特大喜讯。一支报喜队伍去中南海，向毛主席他老人家报喜，欢呼祖国山河一片红。
    硫脂小组几个同志送走了报喜队，激动的心情仍然平静不下来。他们都在想：在这大喜的日子里，我们该干点什么呢？一个工人说：“这是全国人民政治上的一件大事，我们去编黑板报，表达我们的心情，明天也好让更多的人知道这个喜讯，宣传毛泽东思想。”他的话说到了大家的心坎上。几个人立即动手，剪了一张毛主席彩色画像，又找来彩笔，直奔宣传栏而去。
    宣传栏周围没有电灯，看不见，怎么写，怎么画呢？是呀，这可是个问题。等到明天再说吗？不。他们决心立即动手传播这一特大喜讯，欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。一个年轻的女工说：“我们用手电照着干，一定要在今晚出一期新的黑板报！”她的这个建议，得到大家的赞同。
    这个小组的工人无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他们听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。毛主席号召“抓革命，促生产”，他们就以六天时间完成过去一个月才能完成的生产任务。毛主席号召“认真搞好斗、批、改”，他们就狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂的代理人，把他们为统治工人所散布的“压力变动力”论驳得体无完肤。他们在批判“专家治厂”的同时，大胆地改进工艺，缩短生产周期，大大提高了生产效率。工人同志们说：“我们学了毛主席著作，力量就感到特别大。”
    在深夜里，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，借着微弱的手电的光亮，在黑板上恭恭正正地贴上了毛主席画像。在毛主席像的周围，他们一笔笔画出了红太阳的光辉。为了表示永远心向红太阳，他们又细心地描出了向阳的葵花。在葵花向太阳的下面，他们写上了工人阶级“热烈欢呼祖国山河一片红”的心情，写上了工人阶级“祝毛主席万寿无疆”的愿望，写上了工人阶级“一定要解放台湾”的决心……。
    这时，夜已深了。六块黑板报全部出齐了，他们才带着战斗后的喜悦心情回家去。
