Japanese student movement thrives; Tokyo University students bravely repel police suppression. After fierce struggle, they reoccupy the economics and law buildings of Nihon University.

	BEIJING, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, on Sept. 7, students of Nihon University in Tokyo's Kanda district held a third consecutive day of militant demonstrations, strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government's despicable dispatch of a large number of armed police to brutally suppress the students on Sept. 4. The tide of this struggle is now expanding even further.

	In the afternoon of Sept. 7, 5,000 students of Nihon University held a rally in the main campus of the engineering department to protest the Sato reactionary government's suppression of students. A student, speaking at the rally, pointed out that the Sato reactionary government is desperately suppressing the students of Nihon University in an attempt to extinguish the current wave of student struggles sweeping across Japan. The government's plot must be smashed, and the struggle must be carried through to the end. After the rally, the students continued their militant demonstrations, with a grand procession marching through the broad streets of the Kanda district.

	Approximately 1,000 students from Meiji University and Chuo University participated in the rally and demonstration that day, expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Nihon University students. Many red flags fluttered at the head of the procession, some of which bore the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" Workers and citizens also joined the demonstration, supporting the students' brave struggle. The procession swelled to 15,000 people, with the demonstrators' spirits soaring as they chanted slogans such as "Smash the Sato government's suppression of students!"

	As the demonstrators approached the bustling intersection of Omoide Yokocho in the heart of Kanda, about 2,000 armed police of the Sato reactionary government launched a frenzied attack on the demonstrators. The students immediately fought back bravely, hurling stones at the police force. After an hour of fierce struggle, they repelled the police's savage suppression.

	In this struggle, 129 students were illegally arrested, and many were injured. However, the students were not intimidated by the police's fascist atrocities and continued to throw stones at the retreating police with high spirits. Subsequently, the students advanced towards the campus of Nihon University and reoccupied the economics and law buildings. Students from Nihon University and other universities, together with workers and citizens who supported them, held meetings on the streets, with the struggle continuing until after 7 p.m.

    日本学生运动蓬勃开展
    东京大学生英勇打退警察镇压
    经过激烈搏斗重新占领日本大学经济和法律学部大楼
    新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京神田的日本大学的学生七日连续第三天举行战斗示威，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府四日悍然派出大批武装警察对这所大学的学生进行野蛮的镇压。目前，这一斗争浪潮正在更加广泛地展开。
    七日下午，日本大学的五千名学生在理工学部的大学校园内举行抗议佐藤反动政府镇压学生的大会。一名学生在会上讲话时指出，佐藤反动政府拚命镇压日本大学的学生，企图扑灭目前席卷日本各地的学生斗争，必须粉碎反动政府的阴谋，将斗争进行到底。大会结束后，学生们继续举行战斗示威，游行队伍浩浩荡荡走向神田区的一些广阔的街道。
    明治大学和中央大学的约一千名学生参加了这一天的大会和示威游行，表示他们坚决支持日本大学学生的正义斗争，游行队伍前头许多面红旗迎风飘扬，其中有些红旗上写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”工人和市民们也参加了示威游行，支持学生们的英勇斗争。游行队伍壮大到有一万五千人，示威者斗志昂扬，高呼：“粉碎佐藤政府对学生的镇压”等口号。
    当示威群众列队走近神田最繁华的交通中心神保町的十字路口时，大约有两千名佐藤反动政府的武装警察疯狂地袭击示威者。学生们立即英勇还击，向警察部队猛投石块，经过一小时的激烈搏斗，打退了警察的残暴镇压。
    在这场搏斗中，有一百二十九名学生被无理逮捕，许多学生被打伤。但是学生们并没有被警察的法西斯暴行所吓倒，继续斗志昂扬地向溃退的警察投掷石块。随后，学生们继续向日本大学的校园推进，重新占领了经济和法律学部大楼。日本大学和其他大学的学生，还同支持他们的工人和市民一道在街上举行集会，斗争一直持续到下午七点以后。
