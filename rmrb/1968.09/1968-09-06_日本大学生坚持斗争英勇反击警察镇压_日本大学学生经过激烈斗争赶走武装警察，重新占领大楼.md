Japanese students bravely resist police suppression and regain control of buildings

	New students fight back against armed police, reclaiming buildings after intense struggle

	Xinhua News Agency, September 5th - According to the Oriental News Agency: On the morning of the 4th, the reactionary Sato government sent a large number of armed police to Tokyo's Kanda district at the University of Japan to brutally suppress students who were fighting against the corrupt and reactionary educational system. The students bravely and resolutely fought back against the armed police's savage attack. Previously, the University of Japan's Chairman, Koda Juichiro, acted as a lackey for the reactionary Sato government, filing a so-called "lawsuit" with the bourgeois court, demanding that the court order the students to hand over six buildings they had occupied since June 11th.

	Using the court's decision as a pretext, the reactionary Sato government dispatched approximately 1,500 armed police in the early morning of the 4th to suddenly attack the six buildings, including the main university building, that the students had occupied.

	The students who were defending the buildings threw bottles and stones at the armed police, who were using armored vehicles, water cannons, and batons, and bravely fought back. After an hour of struggle, a large number of police broke into the buildings and arrested 132 students who were continuing the fight.

	When many students at the University of Japan heard the news of the armed police attacking the school, they quickly rushed to surround the buildings that had been occupied by the reactionary police and posted many protest letters on the building walls, protesting against the savage suppression by the university's reactionary authorities and the police. Another group of students held a protest demonstration around the university campus.

	That afternoon, about 2,000 students gathered in the campus of the College of Engineering to hold a protest meeting. Many students wore helmets and carried sticks to participate in the meeting. The meeting unanimously emphasized that revolutionary violence must be used to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. After the meeting, the students, full of fighting spirit, held a demonstration march around the university. They bravely rushed into the school buildings and hoisted red flags on the balconies. Outside the buildings, many students and citizens applauded and cheered their brave fighting spirit.

	After an intense struggle, the students finally drove away the armed police summoned by the school's reactionary authorities and reoccupied the buildings. They built barricades and strengthened their defenses, ready to launch new struggles at any moment.

    日本大学学生经过激烈斗争赶走武装警察，重新占领大楼
    新华社五日讯　据东方通讯社报道：佐藤反动政府在四日清晨悍然派出大批武装警察到东京神田的日本大学，对正在坚持进行反对腐朽反动教育制度斗争的学生横加镇压。学生们对武装警察的野蛮袭击进行了坚决的英勇的反击。在这以前，日本大学董事长古田重二良充当佐藤反动政府的走卒，向资产阶级法庭提出所谓“起诉”，要法院作出判决，强迫学生把从六月十一日起被他们占领的六座大楼交回校方。
    佐藤反动政府以法院判决为借口，在四日清晨出动大约一千五百名武装警察，突然袭击了学生们占领的包括大学校部在内的六座大楼。
    坚守在大楼里的学生们向使用装甲车、水龙和警棒的武装警察投掷酒瓶和石块，进行了英勇的反击。经过一小时的搏斗后，大批警察闯进大楼，逮捕了坚持斗争的一百三十二名学生。
    当日本大学的许多学生听到武装警察袭击学校的消息后，赶紧跑来包围了已由反动警察占领的大楼，并在大楼墙上贴了许多抗议书，抗议大学反动当局和警察的野蛮镇压。另一批学生在大学校园周围举行抗议示威。
    当天下午，约有两千名学生聚集在理工学部的校园里举行抗议集会，许多学生头戴钢盔，手执棍棒来参加集会。大会一致强调指出，必须以革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力。会后，学生们斗志昂扬，在大学周围示威游行。他们勇敢地冲进学校大楼，并在大楼的阳台上升起了红旗，在大楼外面的许多学生和市民鼓掌欢呼他们勇敢的战斗精神。
    经过激烈的斗争后，学生们终于赶走了学校反动当局召来的武装警察，重新占领了大楼。他们筑起路障，加强防御，时刻准备投入新的斗争。
