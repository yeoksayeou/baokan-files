Deep into the night, the sea breeze rustles. Inside the house, Grandma Chen, wearing her old glasses, sits under the oil lamp, mending soldier Qiu Xiquan's military uniform with careful stitches. Grandma looks at the faded uniform, thinking that Qiu will be returning to his unit tomorrow, and her heart feels heavy.

At the beginning of the year, Qiu joined the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and came to Grandma Chen's home to implement the "three together" policy. Grandma is over sixty years old, her son works outside, and she lives alone. She treats Qiu like family. Qiu lives here comfortably and warmly, just like at home. After the Cultural Revolution, the remote little mountain village became lively. Big-character posters and roof-top broadcasts are continuous every day. Study sessions on Chairman Mao's works and criticism meetings of the Chinese Khrushchev are frequently held. Grandma attends every meeting. However, since she doesn't know how to read, studying is very difficult. On the very night Qiu arrived, Grandma asked him to teach her the "Three Articles."

Unfortunately, Qiu is not a local and doesn't understand the local dialect, so Grandma can't understand him. That night, Qiu couldn't sleep, thinking: Chairman Mao entrusted me with the task of "supporting agriculture," the most fundamental task is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to spread Chairman Mao's voice to the poor and lower-middle peasants. If the language doesn't communicate, how can I propagate? Qiu recalled Chairman Mao's teachings on overcoming difficulties, and his courage surged: even if the languages are different, the red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao are the same. As long as there is an infinitely loyal red heart to Chairman Mao, what is the difficulty of not understanding the language!

From then on, Qiu made up his mind to learn the local dialect. He humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, took students as his teachers, and learned word by word. After a period of effort, Qiu could finally speak broken local dialect. He first helped Grandma learn the phrase "selflessness and dedication to the collective." It took three days, and finally, he helped Grandma memorize it.

One day, Qiu noticed that the pig manure Grandma picked up was not sent to the collective but all to her private plot. This matter, Qiu saw it with his own eyes and thought about it in his heart. He realized: just teaching Grandma to learn, without teaching her to apply, is like plowing the land without sowing the seeds. That night, Qiu and Grandma studied together Chairman Mao's phrase "only socialism can save China," and they criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms." Qiu said to Grandma: "Whether to send a basket of fertilizer to the collective field or to carry it to the private plot, this small matter contains the struggle between two roads. If you only care about yourself and not the collective, you will go against Chairman Mao's teachings and fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks." After studying and criticizing, Grandma's consciousness was raised, and she realized: it is the Chinese Khrushchev who is desperately promoting the "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" black goods, trying to pull us back to the old road, to suffer twice the hardship and twice the bitterness. This is absolutely not allowed.

From then on, Grandma got up early every day and worked late, picking up pig manure for the collective. In just three months, she accumulated over three thousand pounds of fertilizer for the collective, receiving praise from the masses.

Half a year passed, and Qiu and Grandma formed a deep class friendship.

"Grandma, you're still not asleep!" Grandma Chen woke from her thoughts, looked up, and saw that it was Qiu returning from a meeting. It was already midnight. Under the small oil lamp, Qiu and Grandma Chen opened the "Three Articles" again...

    让毛泽东思想的种子在群众中生根
    夜深人静，海风阵阵。房子里，陈老大娘戴着老花眼镜，坐在油灯下，一针一线地补着战士邱锡泉的军装。大娘端详着这褪色的军装，想到小邱明天就要回部队，心里很不是滋味。
    年初，小邱参加毛泽东思想宣传组，到陈大娘家实行“三同”。大娘六十多岁了，儿子在外工作，家里就剩她一个人。大娘待小邱如同家人。小邱住在这里，和在自己家里一样舒适温暖。文化大革命后，偏僻的小山村活跃起来了，大字报、屋顶广播每天不断，学习毛主席著作讲用会、对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判会经常举行。每次开会大娘都到场。就是不认得字，学习很困难。小邱来的当晚，大娘就让他教学“老三篇”。
    事真不巧，偏偏小邱不是本地人，不懂本地话，大娘听不懂。晚上，小邱怎么也睡不着，心里想：毛主席交给我“支农”的重任，最根本的是宣传毛泽东思想，把毛主席的声音传给贫下中农。话不通，怎么宣传？小邱想起毛主席关于克服困难的教导，顿时勇气倍增，心里豁然开朗：语言不同，忠于毛主席的红心是一样的。只要有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，语言不通的困难又算得了什么！
    从此，小邱下定决心学地方话。他虚心向贫下中农学，拜小学生为师，逐字逐句地学。经过一个时期努力，小邱终于能说夹生的地方话了。他首先帮大娘学“毫不利己专门利人”这段语录，用了三天时间，终于帮助大娘背会了。
    一天，小邱发现大娘拾来的猪粪不是送到队里，而是全部送到自留地里。这事，小邱看在眼里，想在心里。他认识到：光教大娘学，没有教她用，这就等于耕地不下种。晚上，小邱跟大娘一起学习了毛主席的“只有社会主义能够救中国”这段语录，两人展开了对中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”“四大自由”等谬论的批判。小邱对大娘说：“一担肥是往集体地里送还是往自留地挑，这事虽小，里面却含有两条道路的斗争。只顾自己，不顾集体，就会违背毛主席的教导，上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。”经过学习、批判，大娘的思想觉悟提高了，认识到：是中国赫鲁晓夫，拚命推行“三自一包”“四大自由”的黑货，想把我们拉回老路，再吃二遍苦，再受二茬罪。这可万万办不到。
    从那以后，大娘每天起早贪黑，为集体拾猪粪，仅仅三个月的时间，就为集体积肥三千多斤，受到群众赞扬。
    半年过去了，小邱和大娘结下了深厚的阶级感情。
    “大娘，你还没睡！”陈大娘从沉思中醒来，抬头一看，原来是小邱开会回来了。这时已是深夜十二点钟了。小油灯下，小邱和陈大娘又打开了“老三篇”……。
