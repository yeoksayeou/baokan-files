The tool used by the British monopolistic bourgeoisie to control the workers' movement—the British Trade Union Congress—recently held its annual conference in Blackpool. This conference showed that, under the impact of the surging workers' struggle in Britain, the Labour Party government's attempt to use this congress to push through its scheme of shifting the country's fiscal and economic difficulties onto the workers has failed. The British ruling class is sinking deeper and deeper into the political and economic crisis, finding no way out.

The British Trade Union Congress's annual conference was held at a time when the British monopolistic bourgeoisie, in an attempt to extricate itself from the crisis, is stepping up its exploitation of the British working class and the broad masses of laboring people, engaging in even more frantic struggles.

The Labour Party government had tried hard to use this conference to push through its fiscal and economic policies that further cut into the interests of the laboring people. It wanted the 1,000 delegates attending the conference to act as salesmen for its reactionary policies, using both soft and hard tactics to force British workers to accept that, despite soaring prices, wages could not be increased accordingly; that wage increases must be conditional on increased labor intensity, and so on. However, the surging waves of struggle by the British working class against the government's reactionary fiscal and economic policies not only forced many delegates from grassroots trade unions to denounce the Labour Party government's policies, but also led to the rejection or condemnation of certain "proposals" concocted by the Labour Party government to serve its reactionary fiscal and economic policies. Even the proposal to express "confidence" in the Labour Party government, which had been routinely passed at every annual conference during the Labour Party's rule, was opposed by a quarter of the delegates this time.

Faced with this situation, the newspapers of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie lamented that this conference was the "darkest" in the history of this organization.

### 工人反抗一浪高一浪　工党危机一步深一步  英国官办职工大会黯然收场

    工人反抗一浪高一浪　工党危机一步深一步
    英国官办职工大会黯然收场
    据新华社伦敦电　英国垄断资产阶级控制工人运动的工具——英国职工大会，最近在布拉克浦尔召开一次年会。这次会议表明，在英国工人斗争浪潮的冲击下，英国工党政府企图利用这个大会来推行向工人阶级转嫁财政经济困难的阴谋遭到了失败。英国统治集团正在政治、经济危机的泥沼中越陷越深，无法自拔。
    英国职工大会的这届年会，是在英国垄断资产阶级为了摆脱危机而加紧压榨英国工人阶级和广大劳动人民，进行更加疯狂的挣扎的时候召开的。
    英国工党政府曾竭力利用这次大会来推行它加紧向劳动人民利益开刀的财政经济政策，要到会的一千名代表为它的反动政策充当推销员，以便软硬兼施，迫使英国工人同意：尽管物价飞涨，工资却不能相应增加；提高工资必须以增强劳动强度为先决条件，等等。然而，英国工人阶级为强烈反对政府反动的财政经济政策而掀起的一浪高过一浪的斗争浪潮，不仅迫使许多到会的基层工会的代表纷纷谴责工党政府的政策，而且还使得工党政府一手炮制出来的某些为其反动财政经济政策服务的“提案”，遭到了否决或者谴责，甚至在工党当政年代中历届年会中都要例行通过的对工党政府表示“信任”的提案，这次也遭到了四分之一代表的反对。
    面对这种情况，英国垄断资产阶级的报纸哀叹，这次年会是这个组织历史上“最阴暗”的一次年会。
