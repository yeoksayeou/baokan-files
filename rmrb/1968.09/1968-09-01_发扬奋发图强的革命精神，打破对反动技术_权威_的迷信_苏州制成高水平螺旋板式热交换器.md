Recently, Suzhou Chemical Machinery Factory successfully developed a spiral plate heat exchanger that surpasses international advanced levels.

The spiral plate heat exchanger is a new type of high-efficiency heat exchanger suitable for various industries such as chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical, food, dye, and sugar. It is already widely used abroad. Due to the "creeping" policy promoted by Khrushchev and his agents in the mechanical department, China did not have this product in the past and had to rely on imports from foreign countries every year. Therefore, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tightly controlled us, trying every means to obstruct us. In 1965, a comrade saw this product at an exhibition in Beijing and wanted some technical materials to study and manufacture it ourselves. However, that capitalist country did not even provide a manual. Upon returning to the factory, he angrily told everyone about this incident. The workers were indignant and said, "If foreigners can make it, why can't we? The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle. Whatever foreigners have, we must have, and whatever foreigners don't have, we must also have!" The working class's contempt for imperialism and revisionism, and their determination to be self-reliant and strive for strength, deeply educated the technical personnel. They decided to fill this gap together with the workers. However, when revolutionary workers and technical personnel proposed to the factory leadership to develop the spiral plate heat exchanger, they were opposed by a small group of capitalist roaders and some reactionary technical "authorities" in the province. During the great "January Storm" last year, the revolutionary masses of Suzhou Chemical Machinery Factory seized power from the capitalist roaders. Soon, they proposed to the relevant central departments to develop the spiral plate heat exchanger, which immediately received strong support.

During the development process, workers and technical personnel followed Chairman Mao's directive of "learning from foreign technology for our own use," breaking foreign frameworks and dogmas. They analyzed and compared imported products, absorbing the essence and discarding the dross, forging their own unique path, thereby improving product quality and reducing costs.

After half a year of arduous struggle, with the support and assistance of relevant departments, Suzhou Chemical Machinery Factory successfully developed the spiral plate heat exchanger in May this year, with a quality that far surpasses international advanced levels.

    发扬奋发图强的革命精神，打破对反动技术“权威”的迷信
    苏州制成高水平螺旋板式热交换器
    最近，苏州市化工机械厂试制成功了超过国际先进水平的螺旋板式热交换器。
    螺旋板式热交换器是一种新型高效的热交换器，适用于化工、石油、医药、食品、染料、制糖等多种工业部门，目前在外国已广泛应用。由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在机械部门的代理人推行“爬行主义”，过去我国还没有这种产品，每年靠外国进口。因此，帝、修、反死死卡住我们，千方百计刁难我们。一九六五年，一个同志在北京的一个展览会上看到这种产品，想要一些技术资料，以便自己研究制造。可是那个资本主义国家连说明书都不给。回厂后他气愤地把这件事告诉了大伙，工人同志们愤慨地说：“外国人能造的，我们为什么不能造？！用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。外国有的，我们要有，外国没有的，我们也要有！”工人阶级藐视帝国主义、修正主义，决心自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，深深地教育了技术人员。他们决心和工人一起填补这一项空白点。但当革命工人和技术人员，向厂领导提出试制螺旋板式热交换器的建议时，却遭到了一小撮走资派和省里一些反动技术“权威”的反对。在去年伟大的“一月风暴”中，化工机械厂无产阶级革命派夺了走资派的权，不久，便向中央有关部门提出了试制螺旋板式热交换器的建议，立即得到了大力支持。
    在试制过程中，工人和技术人员遵照毛主席“洋为中用”的方针，打破洋框框、洋教条，对进口的产品进行对比分析，吸收精华，排除糟粕，走自己独创的道路，使产品质量提高，成本降低。
    经过短短半年的艰苦奋斗，在有关部门的支持和协助下，化工机械厂终于在今年五月试制成功了螺旋板式热交换器，质量大大超过了国际先进水平。　齐久文
