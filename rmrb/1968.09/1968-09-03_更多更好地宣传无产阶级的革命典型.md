	Promote More and Better Revolutionary Exemplars of the Proletariat

	It is a joy to see the waves of rice and millet, and heroes everywhere as the sun sets.
	Our era is a new era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, an era of heroes. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the midst of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, a batch after batch of advanced collectives and individuals have emerged. All these revolutionary exemplars of the proletariat vividly reflect the great revolutionary spirit of the 700 million Chinese people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "By means of newspapers, the experience of one department can be spread to others, thus promoting the transformation of work in other departments." Practice has proven that promoting revolutionary exemplars and spreading the experiences of revolutionary exemplars is a very important way for newspapers to conduct Mao Zedong Thought education among the people and to promote the progress of various works.

	However, the Chinese Khrushchev vehemently opposes us doing this.

	In the spring of 1963, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call: "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." The great communist spirit of Lei Feng greatly educated and inspired hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. With the flourishing development of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party, the army, and the nation, many Lei Feng-like advanced exemplars have emerged on all fronts. This excellent revolutionary situation terrified the Chinese Khrushchev. In 1964, he frantically shouted: "Newspapers have recently published many exemplars. Is it too many? If it is too many, there is a certain danger, and it may lead to falsification." He arrogantly ordered: "Newspapers should not promote so many exemplars!"

	In the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the continuous emergence of a large number of revolutionary exemplars is a characteristic of the great Mao Zedong era. For proletarian newspapers, promoting these revolutionary exemplars is a natural and inevitable task, and there is never a question of "too many," let alone any "danger." Only the stubborn Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, who stand on the reactionary bourgeois position, can shamelessly slander revolutionary exemplars as "false," complain that there are "too many" exemplars in the newspapers, and feel that there is a "certain danger."

	However, if one thinks that the Chinese Khrushchev opposes any exemplar promotion, that would be wrong. It was also in 1964 that he personally hyped up the so-called "Peach Garden Experience" of his wife Wang XX and spread it widely within and outside the Party! As early as the founding of New China, he had not ordered his agents in the news industry to sing the praises of the big capitalist exemplar Song Qicheng in newspapers and on the radio? From this, it can be seen that the Chinese Khrushchev only opposes the promotion of revolutionary exemplars, while he is very active in promoting counter-revolutionary exemplars!

	In our era, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that nurtures various revolutionary exemplars, and these revolutionary exemplars all shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev's opposition to the promotion of revolutionary exemplars is precisely an opposition to the promotion of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and an opposition to our newspapers using the promotion of revolutionary exemplars to vividly and concretely conduct Mao Zedong Thought education among the people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has destroyed the evil rule of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the news industry, and the time for the working class to occupy the entire news front has arrived. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promote more and better revolutionary exemplars of the proletariat, to advance the thought revolution of the people, and inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to forge ahead bravely along the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

    更多更好地宣传无产阶级的革命典型
    六八二三部队新闻干事　孙扬钦
    喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。
    我们的时代是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，是英雄辈出的时代。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，不断涌现出一批一批先进集体和先进人物。所有这些无产阶级的革命典型，集中地反映了七亿中国人民的伟大革命风貌。
    毛主席教导我们：“经过报纸把一个部门的经验传播出去，就可推动其他部门工作的改造。”实践证明，宣传革命典型，传播革命典型的经验，这是报纸对人民群众进行毛泽东思想教育、推动各项工作前进的一个十分重要的途径。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却极力反对我们这样做。
    一九六三年春，伟大领袖毛主席发出号召：“向雷锋同志学习”。雷锋的伟大共产主义精神，极大地教育和鼓舞了亿万革命人民。随着全党全军全国活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动的蓬勃发展，各条战线涌现出许许多多雷锋式的先进典型。这种大好的革命形势，吓破了中国赫鲁晓夫的胆。一九六四年，他气急败坏地嚷道：报纸“最近发了很多典型，是不是太多了。太多了，就有一定的危险性，就可能出现虚假。”他蛮横地下令：“报纸不要搞那么多典型”！
    在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，大量的革命典型的不断出现，这是伟大的毛泽东时代的特点。宣传这些革命的典型，对于无产阶级报纸说来，是天经地义的事情，永远不存在什么“太多”的问题，更不存在什么“危险性”。只有顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上的中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，才无耻地诬蔑革命典型“虚假”，才嫌报纸上典型宣传“太多”，才会感到“有一定的危险性”。
    但是，如果以为中国赫鲁晓夫反对任何典型宣传，那就错了。也是在一九六四年，他不是亲自出面大肆吹捧他老婆王××搞的什么“桃园经验”，并在党内外广为传播么？早在新中国成立之初，他不是还曾要他在新闻界的代理人在报纸上和广播里歌颂过那个大资本家的典型宋棐卿么？由此可见，中国赫鲁晓夫只是反对宣传革命的典型，而对于反革命典型的宣传，他是多么积极呵！
    在我们的时代，正是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育着各种革命的典型，而这些革命的典型又都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。中国赫鲁晓夫反对宣传革命的典型，正是反对宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，反对我们的报纸通过宣传革命典型对人民群众生动而具体地进行毛泽东思想的教育。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在新闻界的罪恶统治，工人阶级占领全部新闻阵地的时刻到来了。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更多更好地宣传无产阶级的革命典型，以促进人的思想革命化，鼓舞亿万革命人民沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进。
