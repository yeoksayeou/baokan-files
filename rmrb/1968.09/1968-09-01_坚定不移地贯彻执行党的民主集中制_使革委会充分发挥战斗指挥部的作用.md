The revolutionary committee of Qujiang County in Guangdong Province, with the help of local PLA comrades, has resolutely implemented the Party's democratic centralism, enabling the revolutionary committee to fully play the role of a combat command center in class struggle.

In the early days of the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, some revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses who participated in the "three-in-one combination" had some wrong ideas, and the democratic centralism was not well implemented. For example, some cadres who had just come forward to participate in the "three-in-one combination" were afraid of saying the wrong things or doing the wrong things, and did not dare to express their opinions boldly when the revolutionary committee discussed work and studied problems. Some revolutionary mass representatives thought that they were workers and peasants, knew little about the situation in the whole county, and had a shallow understanding of the Party's policies, so they had nothing to say. They believed that they should firmly execute the resolutions made by the revolutionary committee. Therefore, when the revolutionary committee studied work, discussed problems, and made resolutions, the commissioners expressed their opinions less, and often the main members spoke and everyone agreed. After the leading comrades of the county revolutionary committee discovered this problem, they believed that this kind of consensus without dissent was not based on the masses. If it was not corrected in time, the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee could not fully play its role, and it might make various mistakes. Whether the county revolutionary committee could model the implementation of the Party's democratic centralism would have a significant impact on the work of revolutionary committees at all levels.

With the help of the PLA comrades, the county revolutionary committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on democratic centralism. Chairman Mao taught: "In all practical work of our Party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." The county revolutionary committee mobilized everyone to thoroughly criticize the bureaucratic style of a small handful of capitalist roaders in the old county committee who were aloof from the masses, subjective, and arbitrary. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "no destruction, no construction" to criticize the bad style of the old county committee where the capitalist roaders had the final say, and to establish a good style of fully democratic discussion and research on work, and to implement the "hall of public opinion"; to criticize the wrong practice of a few people monopolizing and deciding major issues subjectively during the old county committee period, and to establish a system in the revolutionary committee where all major issues are fully democratically discussed and then concentrated to make unified decisions. The revolutionary committee also severely criticized the reactionary "tame tool" theory of Liu Shaoqi, requiring everyone to fully exert their initiative and creativity. Through the revolutionary criticism, the commissioners of the revolutionary committee unanimously recognized that: whether or not to implement democratic centralism was not a general work method issue, but a major issue of whether to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Whether the revolutionary committee firmly and unswervingly implements the principle of democratic centralism is the key to whether the new-born revolutionary power can forever advance on the track of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and whether it can maximize the concentration of the wisdom of the masses and play a strong role as a command center in class struggle. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings on democratic centralism, take power for the revolution, and use power for the revolution.

After the county revolutionary committee improved its understanding of implementing democratic centralism, every time it studied work, discussed problems, and formulated plans, it followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "not fighting unprepared battles" and issued a "notice to the people" in advance, informing all commissioners of the purpose, intention, and requirements of the meeting. The purpose of doing so was, first, to let each commissioner make full preparations in advance so that everyone could speak freely and fully discuss when the meeting was held; second, to let each commissioner, with the intention of the revolutionary committee, go deep into the masses, widely solicit opinions, and timely reflect the opinions and demands of the masses. In this way, the phenomenon of the main leading members having the final say and the commissioners having no objections was overcome, and the wisdom and initiative of the commissioners were fully exerted, so that the revolutionary committee could make resolutions and deploy work to achieve unity of thought and action.

The revolutionary committee firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience" and not only paid attention to fully exerting the role of revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee but also, when discussing major issues at meetings, invited mass representatives from relevant aspects as much as possible. When studying industrial issues, invite representatives from the workers' congress and relevant industrial departments' mass organizations to participate; when studying agricultural issues, invite representatives from the peasants' congress and key units' members to participate; when discussing school work, invite revolutionary youngsters to participate. Every time a meeting was held, the mass representatives were first allowed to express their opinions and conduct full discussions and consultations. The revolutionary committee affirmed and seriously adopted the correct opinions of the mass representatives, no matter how small they were.

After various works were carefully studied, once a resolution was made, from the chairman to the commissioners, they all went deep into the masses, studied with the masses, and implemented the resolutions together. In the process of implementation, the opinions and problems raised by the masses were brought back to the revolutionary committee for research and solution in a timely manner. In April this year, when carrying out struggles against the enemy, the revolutionary committee only relied on a few backbone members to flip through documents and find materials, making the struggle against the enemy cold and lonely. After the masses raised sharp criticisms, the revolutionary committee immediately improved, and held special study classes on class struggle at the county and commune levels. On the basis of improving everyone's understanding, the masses were fully mobilized and relied upon to carry out struggles against the enemy. As a result, in a short period of time, a batch of spies, traitors, and other counter-revolutionaries who had been hiding for a long time were exposed, achieving a major victory in the struggle against the enemy, and strongly consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The comrades of the revolutionary committee firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Use the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening study to reform oneself to meet the needs of the Party and the revolution." They not only often carried out criticism and self-criticism among the commissioners of the revolutionary committee but also consciously put themselves under the criticism and supervision of the broad masses of the people. They believed that only by seriously carrying out criticism and self-criticism could they unify their understanding, steps, and actions on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. The county revolutionary committee often held heart-to-heart meetings and invited mass representatives to participate in criticizing and helping the members of the revolutionary committee. Once, a representative from the county joint committee severely criticized the tendency of some members of the revolutionary committee's production command department to emphasize production over politics. The chairman of the revolutionary committee and the political commissar of the armed forces, Yu Wanchun, immediately took the lead in making a serious self-examination and promptly praised the comrade's revolutionary spirit of caring about the construction of the revolutionary committee.

In the implementation of democratic centralism, due to the leading comrades' transmission of thought and setting an example, the chairman and commissioners, old and new cadres, and military and local commissioners all dared to open their minds and speak freely, creating a political situation of "having both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual comfort, lively and vivid." This has strongly promoted the development of the county's revolution and production.

    坚定不移地贯彻执行党的民主集中制
    使革委会充分发挥战斗指挥部的作用
    广东曲江县革委会按照毛主席的民主集中制办事，充分发挥每一个成员的智慧和积极性
    本报讯　广东省曲江县革命委员会在当地解放军同志的帮助下，坚决贯彻执行党的民主集中制，使革委会在阶级斗争中，充分发挥了战斗指挥部的作用。
    县革命委员会成立初期，由于有些参加“三结合”的革命干部和革命群众代表存在一些错误认识，民主集中制贯彻得不好。例如，有的刚站出来参加“三结合”的干部，怕说错话，做错事，在革委会讨论工作研究问题时，不敢大胆发表自己的意见。有些革命群众代表认为自己是工人、农民，对全县情况了解不多，对党的方针政策理解不深，自己没有什么可说的，革委会作出决议，自己坚决执行就行了。因此，革委会在研究工作、讨论问题、作决议时，委员发表意见比较少，往往主要成员说了大家通过。县革命委员会领导同志发觉这个问题以后，认为这种表面无异议的集中，是没有群众基础的，如果不及时纠正，那就不能充分发挥“三结合”革命委员会的作用，那就可能要犯这样那样的错误。县革委会能不能模范地执行党的民主集中制，对于各级革命委员会的工作也有重大的影响。
    县革命委员会在解放军同志的帮助下，反复学习了毛主席关于民主集中制的一系列指示。毛主席教导说：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”县革命委员会就发动大家大揭大批旧县委会中一小撮走资派高高在上、脱离群众、主观臆断、独断专横的资产阶级作风。大家遵照毛主席“不破不立”的教导，批判旧县委内走资派说了算的坏作风，树立研究工作、讨论问题充分发扬民主，实行“群言堂”的好作风；批判旧县委时期重大问题由几个人包办代替主观决定的错误作法，树立革委会中一切重大问题的讨论充分发扬民主，然后集中起来统一作出决定的制度。革委会还狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的“驯服工具”论，要求大家充分发挥积极性和创造性。通过革命大批判，革委会委员们一致认识到：执行不执行民主集中制，不是一般的工作方法问题，而是站在毛主席革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的大问题。革命委员会是否坚定不移地执行民主集中制的原则，是关系到新生的革命政权能不能永远沿着毛主席无产阶级革命路线的轨道前进，能不能最大限度地集中群众的智慧，在阶级斗争中发挥坚强指挥部的作用的关键。大家一致表示，一定要坚决按照毛主席关于民主集中制的教导办事，为革命掌好权，用好权。
    曲江县革委会在提高了对贯彻执行民主集中制的认识以后，每次研究工作、讨论问题、制定计划时，都遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“不打无准备之仗”的教导，事先出“安民告示”，把会议的目的、意图、要求先通知所有委员。这样做的目的，一是让每个委员都事前做好充分准备，开起会来，大家畅所欲言，充分讨论；二是使每个委员带着革委会的意图深入群众，广泛征求意见，及时把群众的意见和要求反映上来。这样，就克服了主要领导成员说了算，委员们无异议的不良现象，充分发挥委员们的智慧和积极性，使革委会作决议，部署工作，能够做到统一思想，统一行动。
    县革委会牢记毛主席“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导，不但注意充分发挥革委会中革命群众代表的作用，而且在开会讨论重大问题时，还尽量邀请有关方面派群众代表参加。研究工业问题，邀请工代会和有关工业部门的群众组织代表参加；研究农业问题，就邀请农代会和重点单位的社员代表参加；讨论学校的工作，就邀请革命小将参加。每次开会时，都先让群众代表各抒己见，进行充分的讨论协商，革委会对群众代表的正确意见，那怕一点半点，也给予肯定，认真采纳。
    各项工作经过认真研究，一经作出决议，从主任到委员都深入到群众中去，和广大群众一起学习，一道贯彻执行。在执行中，把群众提出的意见和问题，又及时带回革命委员会研究解决。今年四月开展对敌斗争时，革委会只依靠几个骨干翻档案，找资料，对敌斗争搞得冷冷清清。群众提出尖锐的批评后，革委会立即改进，在县、公社两级分别举办了狠抓阶级斗争专题学习班。在提高大家认识的基础上，充分发动和依靠群众开展对敌斗争。结果，在很短的时间内，就揪出了一批隐藏得很久很深的特务、叛徒和其他反革命分子，取得了对敌斗争的重大胜利，有力地巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    县革委会的同志牢记毛主席的教导：“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要。”他们不仅在革委会委员之间经常开展批评和自我批评，而且自觉地把自己置于广大人民群众的批评监督之下。他们认为，只有认真开展批评和自我批评，才能在毛泽东思想基础上统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。县革委会经常开交心通气会，并且邀请群众代表参加，对革委会成员进行批评帮助。有一次，县机关大联委的一位代表严厉批评了革委会生产指挥部一些成员重生产轻政治的偏向。革委会主任、武装部政委于万春同志，立即带头认真作了检查，并及时表扬了这个同志关心革委会建设的革命精神。
    曲江县革命委员会在执行民主集中制中，由于主要领导成员传思想，带作风，处处做出表率，使主任和委员之间，新老干部之间，军队委员和地方委员之间，都敢于敞开思想，畅所欲言，造成一个“又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”。这就有力地推动了全县革命和生产的发展。
