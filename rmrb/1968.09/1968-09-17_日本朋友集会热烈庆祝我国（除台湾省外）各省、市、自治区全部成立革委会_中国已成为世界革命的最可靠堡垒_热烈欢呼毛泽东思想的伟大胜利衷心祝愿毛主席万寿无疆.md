Japanese friends held a grand meeting in Osaka on the evening of September 13 to enthusiastically celebrate and cheer the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province). They also sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life.

The meeting was organized by the Osaka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Authentic) and the Kansai Branch of the Japan Foreign Trade Promotion Association. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of people worldwide, was hung in the center of the meeting hall. On either side were large posters with Chairman Mao's quotations: "The great proletarian cultural revolution in our country is developing in an excellent way, not in a partial way. The situation now is better than it has ever been." and "All Marxists-Leninists, all revolutionaries of the world, unite! All the people who stand for peace and justice, unite! Let us fight to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow all reactionaries!"

Over 250 revolutionary people of Osaka and friends from the trade circle attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone stood up and sang "The East is Red" in unison, then studied Chairman Mao's quotation together: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. This is history; this is a summary of thousands of years of civilization. To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; to interpret it in the opposite way is historical idealism."

Ryu Miyake, the chairman of the Osaka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Authentic), delivered the main report at the meeting. Ryu Miyake enthusiastically praised the victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) has greatly strengthened the proletarian dictatorship in China, marking a historic milestone. Ryu Miyake said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has now entered a new stage, with large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering schools to carry out educational reforms, which will make even greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Ryu Miyake emphasized that China has become the most reliable bastion of world revolution.

Ryu Miyake said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy is getting more rotten every day, and we are getting better every day." The imperialist camp led by American imperialism is in chaos both internally and externally, while the modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet revisionists is in disarray and on the verge of collapse. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified and enraged by the great victories achieved by the Chinese revolutionary people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and they are doing their utmost to slander and defame, attempting to resist the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, but all in vain.

Ryu Miyake pointed out that the contradictions between imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries and the revolutionary people striving for national independence and liberation will become increasingly sharp. He said that the United States and the Soviet revisionists are colluding to form an anti-China encirclement. Now is the time for us to counter-encircle American imperialism and its lackeys. This great struggle is not only the struggle of the Japanese people for independence and peace but also the struggle of the people of the world for independence and liberation.

Ryu Miyake highly praised Mao Zedong Thought as the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the strongest weapon for the revolutionary people of the world. He said that we must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and strive for even greater victories.

Yasuo Hoshida, a representative of the Osaka Prefecture Committee (Leftist) of the Japanese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that our great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, has pointed out to all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world the great direction of the proletariat seizing power through people's war and, after seizing power, advancing towards communism through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Hoshida said that Marxism-Leninism has developed to the highest stage of Mao Zedong Thought in contemporary times. He said that the working class and people of Japan must, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow the Japanese and American reactionaries and their lackeys, and shoulder the historical mission of liberating Japan.

Hoshida said that we must arm the working class with Mao Zedong Thought and broadly unite the people to fight against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to remove U.S. military bases, and to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

Ichirou Kimura, the executive director of the Kansai Branch of the Japan Foreign Trade Promotion Association, enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao. He said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has opened a new era in human history.

Kimura said that the slanders and defamations of imperialism and revisionism against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China have all failed. They are becoming more isolated and are on the verge of complete collapse.

A staff member from the Tokyo Liaison Office of the China-Japan Trade Memorandum Office was invited to attend the celebration meeting and spoke.

All the speakers at the meeting, with revolutionary passion, shouted: "Long live the fighting unity of the peoples of China and Japan! Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The revolutionary people of Osaka, amidst warm applause, presented a red flag to the Chinese people. It read: "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" The attendees also signed their names on the red flag.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the Osaka Mao Zedong Thought Institute performed revolutionary art programs praising the great teacher Chairman Mao, which were warmly received by the attendees.

Finally, the meeting ended triumphantly with everyone singing "The Internationale" together.

    日本朋友集会热烈庆祝我国（除台湾省外）各省、市、自治区全部成立革委会
    中国已成为世界革命的最可靠堡垒
    热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆
    据新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部和日本国际贸易促进协会关西总部十三日晚在大阪隆重集会，热烈庆祝和欢呼中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立革命委员会，并且衷心敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    大会会场正中央悬挂着全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像。两旁贴着大幅的毛主席语录：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。”
    大阪的革命人民和友好贸易界人士二百五十多人参加了集会。集会开始时，全体起立，齐声高唱《东方红》，然后共同学习了毛主席语录：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”
    日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部理事长雨宫礼三在会上作了总报告。雨宫在报告中热情赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的胜利。他说，中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立革命委员会，大大地加强了中国无产阶级专政，这是具有划时代的意义的。雨宫说，中国无产阶级文化大革命现在已经发展到一个崭新的阶段，大批工人毛泽东思想宣传队正在开进学校搞教育革命。这将对无产阶级文化大革命做出更大的贡献。
    雨宫强调说，中国已经成为世界革命的最可靠的堡垒。
    雨宫说，毛主席教导我们：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营，内外交困，焦头烂额，以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团勾心斗角、分崩离析。帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派对中国革命人民所取得的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利怕得要死，恨得要命，因而极尽诬蔑、中伤之能事，妄想抵制中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，但这是徒劳的。
    雨宫指出，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派同争取民族独立与解放的革命人民之间的矛盾，将发展得越来越尖锐。他说，美帝同苏修相互勾结，组成了反华包围圈。现在是我们要对美帝国主义及其走狗实行反包围的时候了。这个伟大的斗争，不仅是争取独立与和平的日本人民的斗争，而且是要求独立与解放的世界人民的斗争。
    雨宫高度赞扬毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的最强大的斗争武器。他说，我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，为争取更加辉煌的胜利而奋斗。
    日共大阪府委员会（左派）代表保田敏男在会上讲话。他说，我们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志向全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民指出了无产阶级通过人民战争夺取政权，以及在夺取政权以后，经过无产阶级文化大革命走向共产主义的伟大方向。
    保田说，马克思列宁主义已经发展到毛泽东思想这一当代最高的阶段。他说，我们日本的工人阶级和人民一定要在毛泽东思想指引下，打倒美日反动派及其帮凶，并且承担起解放日本的历史使命。
    保田说，我们必须用毛泽东思想武装工人阶级，并且广泛地团结人民，为粉碎日美“安全条约”，撤除美国军事基地，反对复活日本军国主义而斗争。
    日本国际贸易促进协会关西总部专务理事木村一三，热烈赞扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，中国无产阶级文化大革命开创了人类历史的新纪元。
    木村说，帝国主义和修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命的谩骂和中伤，都一个个地破产了。它们越来越孤立，正面临着全面的崩溃。
    中日备忘录贸易办事处驻东京联络处的工作人员应邀出席了庆祝集会，并讲了话。
    在会上讲话的人都怀着革命激情高呼：“中日两国人民的战斗团结万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    大阪革命人民在热烈的掌声中，向中国人民赠送了一面红旗。上面写着：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！”与会者还在红旗上签了字。
    大阪的毛泽东思想学院的毛泽东思想宣传队，满怀着革命激情，在会上演出了歌颂伟大导师毛主席的革命文艺节目，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    最后，大会在全体高唱《国际歌》声中胜利结束。
