Recently, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has repeatedly dispatched military aircraft to invade our airspace, exacerbating border tensions and brazenly conducting military provocations against our country. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's evil deeds are part of its organized and planned actions to implement its policy of colluding with the United States to oppose China.

For a period of time, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has actively cooperated with American imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy, colluding with the American imperialists and reactionaries of various Asian countries to hasten the formation of a counter-revolutionary anti-China encirclement.

It has been vigorously promoting so-called "détente" in Europe, helping American imperialism implement its plan to shift its military focus eastward and strengthen its military deployments in Asia.

It has joined forces with American imperialism to create so-called "nuclear umbrellas" around China, setting up nuclear bases and increasing nuclear threats against our country.

It has been intensifying its collusion with the reactionaries of India, Indonesia, and other countries, coordinating with the American imperialists to increase economic and military "aid" to them, inciting and utilizing them to engage in anti-China activities.

It has been closely aligned with the Japanese reactionaries, collaborating with the Sato government to act as a henchman for American imperialism in opposing China and suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Southeast Asia.

And so on, the list goes on.

The Soviet revisionists, American imperialists, and reactionaries of various countries have joined forces to create an anti-China encirclement. This is determined by their reactionary class nature and is a manifestation of their desperate struggles.

They are extremely hostile to the great socialist China because the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are resolutely opposing American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and are resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Great Mao Zedong Thought has become the most sharp weapon guiding the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. A powerful socialist China has become the most reliable revolutionary base for the peoples of the world. Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired the revolutionary peoples of the world. This makes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries hate and fear it to death. In this era where the world has entered a new age with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, and at a time when the Chinese people have achieved a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, armed with the brilliant truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" pointed out by Chairman Mao, are resolutely taking the Chinese path and rising up in rebellion. The peoples of Europe and North America are also increasingly awakening, launching powerful revolutionary mass movements, and powerfully impacting the rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are in trouble both internally and externally, and their days are hard to pass. Thus, they are desperately trying to resist the influence of China's Cultural Revolution, block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought around the world, and even dream of one day being able to uproot the revolutionary red flag that is flying high on the Asian continent. These guys truly have evil hearts and big guts!

The Chinese people have never been afraid of being encircled by anyone. We have seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we have friends all over the world. Can they encircle us? What a joke!

However, we must also have a full estimate of the craziness of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. Our People's Liberation Army and the people of the entire country must be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash their provocations and give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We still hope that those who play with fire will not be too reckless. We solemnly warn them: Be a little more cautious. This fire is not something to be played with. Be careful of your own heads."

Listen, heroes who oppose China: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If you dare to test the defense forces of the People's Republic of China and touch even a single hair of ours, we will not be lenient. Whether you act alone or in collusion, the People's Liberation Army and the people of the entire country are ready to "welcome" you at any time.

The American imperialists and Soviet revisionists are forming an anti-China encirclement, first of all, to strategically encircle our country and prepare for military provocations against our country. At the same time, they want to use the cover of anti-China smoke to suppress the burgeoning national liberation movements in the Asian region, and to control and invade the countries around China politically, economically, and militarily. Their intentions are extremely sinister. However, their actions can only awaken the peoples of various countries and make the revolutionary storms in Asia rise even more fiercely.

In fact, due to their implementation of counter-revolutionary policies, the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their running dogs have already placed themselves in the encirclement of the peoples of various countries. The revolutionary peoples of various countries are launching continuous and fierce attacks against them. Their desperate struggles will only accelerate their own doom.

    警告搞反华包围圈的英雄好汉们
    中国人民解放军驻石家庄某部  王新涛
    最近，苏修叛徒集团不断派遣军用飞机入侵我国领空，加剧边境紧张局势，肆无忌惮地对我国进行军事挑衅活动。苏修叛徒集团的这种罪恶行径，是它推行联美反华政策的有组织有计划的行动。
    一个时期以来，苏修叛徒集团积极配合美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，同美帝和亚洲各国反动派进行勾结，加紧拼凑反革命的反华包围圈。
    它竭力在欧洲搞所谓“缓和”，帮助美帝国主义实行兵力重点东移的计划，加强在亚洲的军事部署。
    它同美帝国主义一道在中国周围大搞所谓“核保护伞”，布设核基地，加强对我国的核威胁。
    它加紧勾结印度、印尼等反动派，同美帝相配合，不断增加对它们的经济和军事“援助”，鼓动和利用它们进行反华活动。
    它同日本反动派打得火热，伙同佐藤政府充当美帝反对中国、镇压东南亚各国人民革命的帮凶。
    如此等等，不一而足。
    苏修、美帝、各国反动派勾结在一起，大搞反华包围圈，这是它们反动的阶级本质所决定的，也是它们垂死挣扎的表现。
    它们之所以极端仇恨伟大的社会主义中国，是因为用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。伟大的毛泽东思想，成为指引世界人民革命斗争最锐利的武器。强大的社会主义中国，成为世界人民最可靠的革命根据地。我国的无产阶级文化大革命，大大鼓舞世界革命人民。这使帝修反恨得要死，怕得要命。在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代的今天，在中国人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的今天，亚、非、拉革命人民，以毛主席指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉真理为武器，坚决走中国的道路，纷纷起来造反。欧洲、北美的广大人民也日益觉醒，掀起了强大的革命群众运动，有力地冲击着国际垄断资产阶级的统治。帝修反内外交困，日子难熬。于是，它们就竭力想要抵制中国文化大革命的影响，阻挡毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，甚至梦想有朝一日能够拔除高高飘扬在亚洲大陆上的这面革命红旗。这些家伙真是好毒的心肠，好大的胆子！
    中国人民从来就不怕任何人的包围。我们有七亿用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，我们还有遍天下的朋友，能包围得了吗？笑话！
    但是，我们对于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的疯狂性，也必须有充分的估计。我们人民解放军和全国人民一定要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎它们的挑衅，给予敢于来犯的敌人以迎头痛击。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们还是希望那班玩火的人，不要过于冲昏头脑。我们正式警告他们说：放谨慎一点吧，这种火是不好玩的，仔细你们自己的脑袋。”
    反华的英雄好汉们听着：中国人民不是好惹的，如果你们胆敢试探一下中华人民共和国的国防力量，触犯我们一根毫毛，我们是绝对不会客气的。不管你们是单干也好，合伙干也好，我们中国人民解放军和全国人民都随时准备“接待”。
    美帝和苏修拼凑反华包围圈，首先当然是为了要对我国实行战略包围，准备对我国发动军事挑衅。但是同时则是要在反华烟幕的掩盖下，镇压亚洲地区蓬勃发展的民族解放运动，从政治上、经济上、军事上控制和侵略中国周围的国家。用心是极其阴险的。可是，它们的这种做法，只能促进各国人民的觉醒，使亚洲的革命风暴更猛烈地兴起。
    事实上，美帝、苏修及其走狗们由于推行反革命的政策，已把自己置于世界各国人民的包围之中。各国革命人民正在对它们发动连续的猛烈的进攻。它们的垂死挣扎必将加速自己的灭亡。
