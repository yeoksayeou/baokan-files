**Editor's Note of the Liberation Army Daily:** "To lead a great revolution, one needs a great party and many excellent cadres." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured countless cadres who are loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to Chairman Mao. Comrade Yu Chun is a prominent example among them.

Yu Chun is an old comrade who joined the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War. After victory, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, remained humble, and did not become arrogant. He always maintained a vigorous revolutionary spirit. Even when facing life-threatening cancer, he, with a "seize the day" revolutionary spirit, studied and propagated Mao Zedong Thought more diligently and selflessly served the Party and the people. He is an excellent model for all comrades in the army, especially the older cadres.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has always been deeply concerned about the growth of new cadres and the progress of old cadres. In this new period of socialist revolution, Chairman Mao proposed the five conditions for cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and also raised the issue of old cadres maintaining their proletarian revolutionary integrity. This is Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking and his deep concern and expectation for all cadres.

Revolutionary old cadres are the backbone of the proletarian dictatorship, shouldering the responsibility of leading new cadres. Old cadres maintaining their revolutionary integrity is a major issue concerning whether the Party and the state remain red, and whether the army will change or not.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us to maintain revolutionary integrity, saying, "The most important thing is to follow the five conditions set by Chairman Mao. In simple terms, it is to believe in Chairman Mao, believe in the masses, and correctly handle oneself."

Comrade Yu Chun is doing exactly that. He has always followed Chairman Mao in revolution, the older he gets, the closer he follows, never stopping, never losing his way. He has always been close to the people, serving them diligently. He never forgets his shortcomings and always forgets his achievements, actively applying Chairman Mao's works, reforming his worldview, learning until old age, and reforming until old age. Thus, he remains vigorous and forever young in revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is not difficult for a person to do some good deeds, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, never do bad deeds, always benefit the broad masses, always benefit the youth, always benefit the revolution, and struggle hard for decades like one day. This is the most difficult!" We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "Do not rely on past merits, but create new ones." We must take Comrade Yu Chun as an example, continue the revolution, become redder with age, and forever be a staunch fighter for the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The brilliant light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions shines over the five lakes and four seas. New revolutionary committees are springing up across the six hundred million people of China. In this great situation where the country is red, and in the midst of the battle drums calling for a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, we are filled with immense excitement as we introduce to you a comrade praised as a living Jiao Yulu, forever young in revolution, and a good cadre of Chairman Mao—Political Commissar Yu Chun of the Garrison Office of a certain artillery unit on the front lines of Fujian.

"Treading over green mountains, one does not grow old."

Yu Chun, the son of a poor peasant, embarked on the revolutionary journey during the most arduous days of the Anti-Japanese War. For twenty-six years, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Yu Chun bravely fought, worked diligently, was awarded multiple times, and was selected as a model multiple times. During the socialist revolution, Yu Chun remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Winning the country is only the first step of the long march... We must always maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and always maintain a hardworking and struggling spirit." He did not boast of his achievements, remained humble, and always maintained a vigorous revolutionary spirit. He long-term insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses, organize the masses, and maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the masses, always advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary path. He vowed to dedicate every second of his life to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the people. The masses praised him:

"As age increases, the closer one follows Chairman Mao,
The worse the body, the more revolutionary the spirit,
The higher the position, the closer the heart to the people,
The more contributions, the more new merits for the people."

"Life is for the people, fight as long as one lives."

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the people, dedicate oneself to the end." When facing life-threatening cancer, Yu Chun, with profound proletarian feelings and astonishing willpower, studied Chairman Mao's works diligently; with high revolutionary optimism and fervor, he selflessly served the people. He said: "Life is for the people, fight as long as one lives!"

In the spring of 1961, Deputy Political Commissar Yu Chun of a certain artillery regiment suddenly fell ill. His weight dropped from over 130 jin to just over 80 jin. After repeated examinations, the diagnosis was: colon adenocarcinoma.

Yu Chun faced a stern test of life and death.

At this time, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were jointly attacking Mao Zedong Thought; China's Khrushchev was vigorously restoring capitalism, madly sabotaging Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the poison of the bourgeois military line of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai had not been completely eradicated, and the class struggle at home and abroad was extremely sharp and complex. At this time, the entire army, in a fighting posture, enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought," launching a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Yu Chun, with the utmost loyalty to Chairman Mao, bravely fought on!

"To struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, think of the suffering of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and that is a worthy death." Chairman Mao's words were worth their weight in gold, each sentence weighing a thousand pounds, giving Yu Chun immense strength. He said: "As long as the heart beats, one must study Chairman Mao's works; as long as there is a breath, one must breathe with the people; as long as the body can move, one must advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!"

Facing the threat to his life, Yu Chun struggled to sit up, leaning against the bedrail, insisting on reading Chairman Mao's works. When dizzy, he closed his eyes and recited silently; when the stomach ache was severe, he read aloud. He read Chairman Mao's books with such concentration, so engrossed, forgetting fatigue, forgetting pain. The nurse advised him to rest, but he said: "Chairman Mao's books, once I pick them up, I can't put them down." He was like this, with the deepest proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, reading Chairman Mao's works on the sickbed, word by word, completing the reading of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" volumes 1 to 4. The radiant "Three Articles" he read the most, thought the deepest, and used the best. One day, he read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again, circling the words "completely" and "thoroughly" four times in red. Then he wrote: "At the moment of life and death, how can one completely and thoroughly serve all the people of China and the world?" He thought, thought again and again....

In the midst of cancer pain, Yu Chun, with the utmost loyalty to Chairman Mao, seized every minute to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Yu Chun had been transferred to several hospitals. Wherever he stayed, the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works became thick; wherever he was, the political and ideological work of the party branch became lively. Once, a branch meeting was held in the ward, and Yu Chun, as a branch member, was not notified because he was running a high fever. Knowing this, he insisted on attending. At the meeting, he detailed his opinions on studying Chairman Mao's works and grasping the active thoughts of the workers and soldiers on rest. Until he had no strength left to speak, he was carried back to the ward.

In the midst of cancer pain, Yu Chun still followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "completely selfless and dedicated to others," enduring the pain to take care of other patients. The recuperating soldiers said: "Comrade Yu Chun is the sickest, the most in need of care from others, but he cares the most about others." Even when the cancer pain struck, he endured the pain himself, not wanting to bother others. One night, Yu Chun's cancer pain struck again. Remembering the image of Norman Bethune, who, on his deathbed, still cared for others rather than himself, he endured the pain without a sound. The nurse wanted to call the doctor, but he quickly said: "The doctor still has to work tomorrow, let him sleep a little longer."

Facing the threat to his life, Yu Chun did not relax his self-reform or the struggle against the "self" in his mind. He often used the "Three Articles" to examine himself, finding any trace of selfishness and firmly struggling against it. He said: "One must not take selfishness to the grave. Even in death, one must leave a loyal heart to Chairman Mao."

Soon, the hospital performed a wide excision surgery on Yu Chun's cancer. Two meters of his intestines were removed. The surgery was successful.

At that time, there was a saying about cancer that the lifespan of a patient after surgery was at most three to five years, and there was always the risk of cancer metastasis. Yu Chun, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, first thought of the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary cause. He said: "How to deal with the 'three to five years' issue is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. 'Three to five years,' in the minds of Communist Party members, is absolutely not a signal to wait for death, but a signal to fight, a signal to work harder for the Party!"

Yu Chun, with a "seize the day" revolutionary spirit, strengthened his exercises to create conditions for early discharge and continue serving the people.

A few days after the surgery, he surprisingly got out of bed to practice walking. He covered his stomach with one hand, supported himself against the wall with the other, panting, sweating, and finally took the precious first step. This step showed Yu Chun's revolutionary heroism of "defeating all enemies and never being defeated by enemies!" This step showed Yu Chun's thorough revolutionary spirit of dedicating his limited life to the unlimited service of the people! This step showed Yu Chun's boundless love for Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line step by step!

During his struggle with cancer, Yu Chun always placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works above life and heavier than life. It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave him superhuman courage and boundless strength, enabling him to defeat cancer and defeat death. Two months later, Yu Chun, full of passion, stood tall and marched towards a new battlefield.

"The responsibility of a leader is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought."

Yu Chun, carrying the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works, arrived at the Garrison Office to serve as the Political Commissar. He seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander, the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." He believed that arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought was the most fundamental way to connect with the masses and the greatest politics. He said: "The responsibility of a leader is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought."

As soon as Yu Chun arrived at the Garrison Office, he dove into the masses, conducting investigations and visits. Some family members had posters of fat children riding carp, and some family members talked about adding furnishings, eating, and dressing up. Yu Chun, with a high level of line struggle awareness, saw these phenomena and immediately realized that this was not just a trivial matter of life but a sharp struggle between two lines on the construction direction of the Garrison Office.

Yu Chun followed Chairman Mao's teachings and built the Garrison Office from a political perspective. He told the cadres: "Family work and military work are the same; both must grasp political and ideological work as the fundamental issue. If we only handle household chores and not revolution, we will lose our political direction. We must not have no battlefield in our hearts!" His words greatly inspired everyone. The cadres raised their awareness, clarified the direction, and vigorously carried out political and ideological work. They started from class education, addressed the active thoughts of the family members, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and organized family members to open up wasteland and produce collectively. The family members thought about revolution, exerted themselves for revolution, and said: Household chores are revolutionary household chores and should be filled with Mao Zedong Thought; raising children is to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

"Correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." Just as the Garrison Office was advancing along Chairman Mao's military line, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing's wind of large-scale military exercises also blew to the Garrison Office. Some people, influenced by the bourgeois military line, said that the Garrison Office was not a platoon, studying politics, engaging in labor, making people so tense, was unnecessary. In this fierce struggle between the two lines, Yu Chun, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly said:

"The direction of building the Garrison Office under the high banner of Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely correct." He, despite his illness, took a fighting posture, drop by drop, instilling Mao Zedong Thought into the minds of family members and children. Once, he was to give a lecture on studying Chairman Mao's works to the family members. He prepared thoroughly in advance. On the day of the lecture, he suddenly had severe abdominal pain and chills all over. The cadres advised him to rest and to give the lecture instead, but Yu Chun said: "You haven't prepared, so I'll give the lecture! I can't affect everyone's study." In the classroom, Yu Chun loudly read Chairman Mao's works and seriously explained Chairman Mao's great teachings. It was not until the lecture was over that the family members noticed his pale face, turning from green to white, and realized that he had given the lecture despite his illness. They were deeply moved: "Our good political commissar, you have spent so much heart and soul to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to revolutionize our thoughts!"

Yu Chun dedicated himself, pouring his heart and soul into his work, studying and working more than twelve hours a day, sometimes even sixteen or seventeen hours. Comrades advised him to rest, but he said: "For the sake of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, dying from overwork is also a happy thing!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In today's world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." For a long time, the bourgeois command headed by China's Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, let the poisonous plays of emperors, generals, talents, and beauties emerge one after another, launching a mad attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. In this battle, Yu Chun showed his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. He said: "We workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy the stage and turn the stage into a red stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought." In 1964, he personally organized the family performance troupe, personally participated in modifying and singing materials, personally directed rehearsals, and personally performed on stage, enthusiastically singing about the new people and new things shining with Mao Zedong Thought. Once, Yu Chun participated in the chorus, singing "The soldiers of Chairman Mao listen to the Party's words the best," but someone thought it was not good to sing and wanted to change it. Yu Chun disagreed. He said: "This song can fully express the deep proletarian feelings of revolutionary soldiers for Chairman Mao and must be sung well." Family member Shi Xuelan was older and less educated, and had difficulties participating in the performance. Yu Chun patiently explained the significance of the performance to her, saying: "We revolutionary family members and poor and lower-middle peasants must take back the stage occupied by emperors, generals, talents, and beauties!" Shi Xuelan, with this question, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's discussions on literature serving politics, raised her line struggle awareness. To memorize the lines, she recited while cooking, laboring, walking, and even in bed until she memorized them perfectly. One day, she went to a production team to perform, but due to motion sickness, she vomited continuously. But as soon as she thought of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, she was instantly filled with strength and rushed to the stage as soon as she got off the car. Over the years, the family performance troupe has performed many times in military units, rural areas, and towns, enthusiastically singing about Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the Garrison Office became a strong fighting collective. They responded to every battle order from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, moving with the wind and following step by step. Chairman Mao called for caring about state affairs, so they subscribed to newspapers, listened to broadcasts, and actively understood the class struggle situation in society; Chairman Mao called for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," so they actively studied and applied the "Three Articles" in every household, and everyone had a revolution in their souls; Chairman Mao called for launching a revolutionary criticism, so they published special issues, broadcasted, held meetings, and verbally and writtenly criticized China's Khrushchev; Chairman Mao called for holding study classes, so they immediately took action, and all family members were students of the study class. Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they immediately studied and actively propagated them; as soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions were set to music, they immediately taught and sang them, spreading them quickly. The Garrison Office truly became a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Caring for the people's lives is caring for the revolutionary cause."

While arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, Yu Chun also remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "To make the masses devote all their strength to the front line, we must sincerely serve the interests of the masses, solve the problems of the masses' production and life, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, the problem of giving birth to children, solve all the problems of the masses. Have we done this? The broad masses will definitely support us, regard the revolution as their life, and regard the revolution as their highest honor flag." He said: "Caring for the people's lives is caring for the revolutionary cause; the more meticulous and thorough you care for the people's lives, the more the people will consciously and enthusiastically care for the revolutionary cause. Cadres tie their hearts to the people, and the people will tie their hearts to the revolutionary cause. In this way, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses can be fully mobilized, and they can more seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, loving Chairman Mao more."

Soon after taking office, the superior decided to build barracks for the Garrison Office. At that time, Yu Chun's postoperative complications were still severe. To choose a barracks location that was conducive to family members and children not leaving labor, not leaving the masses, and not occupying cultivated land, he forgot to eat and sleep, personally leading the staff to climb all the hills around the county; to build the barracks quickly, economically, and well, so that the family members could feel the warmth of the Party and inspire revolutionary enthusiasm, he, despite his illness, carefully understood the laws of wind and rain in the area, observed the situation of soil erosion; found a hundred-year-old ruin, studied the ability of the mud wall to withstand wind and rain. Once, due to overwork, he fainted on a hillside. Comrades sent him to the medical team, and the doctors, both heartbroken and reproachful, said: "Commissar Yu only knows how to care for the people and never knows how to care for himself. This time you really should rest!" But two hours later, Yu Chun was gone. He quietly left the medical team and went to work on building the barracks again....

The barracks were built. Every room, every piece of equipment, even the small stove in the kitchen, was filled with Yu Chun's heart's blood. To make the stove take up less space and be convenient to use, Yu Chun used his rest time, dragging his weak body, dismantled and repaired his family's stove, repaired and dismantled, repeatedly experimenting, finally building a triangular stove in the corner of the wall. Next to the stove door, he specially left a small square hole for matches. Whenever the triangular stove was mentioned, the family members would gratefully say: "Our barracks are built with Yu Chun's heart's blood mixed with mud."

Yu Chun cared for the people's lives, meticulously and thoroughly. He required himself: whatever he could think of, he must think of, and whatever he could do, he must do. Once, family member Wang Yizhen was going to the front to visit her husband. The night before, Yu Chun was already worried for her: Wang Yizhen had three children and had to bring some things, and the public bus started early, and if not careful, she might miss the bus. He was troubled by this matter, and couldn't sleep peacefully. Before dawn, he got up, pushing his bicycle to help Wang Yizhen carry things and pull children. When he arrived at Wang Yizhen's door, it was only four o'clock. He thought, Wang Yizhen would be on the bus for a day, shaking, let her sleep a little longer! So he sat on the steps, quietly waiting. He waited until five o'clock before knocking on the door. Wang Yizhen saw it was five o'clock and was a bit panicked. Yu Chun comforted her: "Don't worry, I've calculated the time, it's on time!" Saying this, he helped her pack things, and accompanied her all the way to the bus. Wang Yizhen sat on the bus, her heart could not calm down: Yu Chun thought of more things for me than I did for myself!

Yu Chun's mind only had the people, with no place for "I." One spring, his wife fell ill and was hospitalized. The hospital called long-distance, saying the condition was serious, asking him to come quickly. After arriving at the hospital, he first visited other family members of the Garrison Office who were hospitalized, caring about their study of Chairman Mao's works, their condition, and whether they had any difficulties in life, until he had visited and asked about all the hospitalized family members, and then went to visit his wife. Now, whenever the family members mentioned this, their hearts would surge. They said with tears: "Our good political commissar, he is using his actions to teach us the 'Three Articles'!"

Yu Chun followed Chairman Mao's teachings, doing his best to care for the people, the higher his position, the closer his heart to the people, the more intimate his feelings with the people, the more diligent his service to the people, and the people felt the warmth of the Party from Yu Chun, consciously tying their hearts to the revolutionary cause, "regarding the revolution as their highest honor flag."

One year, the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits plotted to invade the mainland, and the frontline troops strengthened their combat readiness. The broad family members voluntarily wrote letters encouraging their husbands on the frontline to bravely fight the enemy and achieve merits for the people. The fourth platoon of family members also collectively wrote a letter to the Party Committee, firmly expressing: Once the battle starts, immediately rush to the frontline and fight shoulder to shoulder with the broad cadres and soldiers.

While the family members were actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promoting their own revolutionization, they also regarded cultivating successors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao as the greatest service to the people. Family member Zheng Jinrong often gave her children class education. Once, she made a piece of clothing for her child, but the child thought it was not good-looking and did not want to wear it, making her very sad. That night, she told her child a story in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. She said that before liberation, a seven-year-old girl could not eat enough or dress warmly, following her mother to beg for food everywhere. In the winter, she wore a broken sack, slept in a broken temple at night, and covered herself with corn stalks. The cold wind blew, freezing the little girl to tears. In the summer, the little girl had a poisonous sore on her neck, with no money to buy medicine, almost losing her life... The story was not finished, but the children were already eagerly asking: Is that little girl still alive? Zheng Jinrong could no longer hold back her tears, pointing to the scar on her neck, said: "That little girl is mom! It was Chairman Mao who saved mom. You must remember mom's bitter days, be a good child of Chairman Mao, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!" The children, with tears in their eyes, excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

Preventing officialdom like preventing epidemics, forever preserving the nature of the laboring people.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches: "We Communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment be separated from the masses. As long as we do not separate from the masses, we will definitely be victorious."

Yu Chun has a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's great teachings. He said: "A leading cadre must not be special, participate in labor, struggle hard, and prevent officialdom like preventing epidemics. Only by not leaving labor and not leaving the masses can one forever preserve the nature of the laboring people and forever be young in revolution." After the founding of the nation, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing crazily promoted the bourgeois military line. They vigorously pushed the rank system and also made many special rules in eating, drinking, and dressing, attempting to turn our military cadres into officials detached from labor and the masses. In this situation, Yu Chun remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, always placing himself in the position of an ordinary party member, an ordinary soldier, and an ordinary laborer, struggling hard for decades like one day, and being heart to heart and breath to breath with the masses. Everyone said: He had no official airs, he was an ordinary laborer.

To effectively prevent officialdom, Yu Chun always regarded himself as a member of the laboring people. He believed that special treatment in life would foster privileged thoughts; with privileged thoughts, one would increasingly pursue special treatment in life, and over time, it would lead to political degeneration and change. He said: "Doing revolution, one must not seek comfort, must not fear hardship. Hardship can conquer the world, hardship can defend the country." For many years, Yu Chun still lived a hard life like in the war years. His mosquito net had twenty-six patches, his quilt cover had thirty-four patches, but he treasured them like treasures, continued to use them, and regarded these things as "reminders" to never forget his roots. Comrades, seeing his weak constitution, often kindly advised him: "Commissar, you are sick, you should pay more attention to nutrition!" Every time, he would tell everyone: "Life should be compared to the old society, compared to poor and lower-middle peasants, compared to the billions of people in the world who are still not liberated, coarse food and plain rice are the best nutrition." Even when the cancer was most severe and he needed nutrition the most, his life was not special, and the hospital arranged "designated meals" for him, which he politely declined. He said: "A leading cadre, if his position is high, his body also becomes 'noble,' special in life, only caring for the body, not for revolution, will detach from the masses and become a revisionist."

To effectively prevent officialdom, Yu Chun made a strict rule for himself: long-term participation in labor. He participated in labor, not just for show, but rolled up his sleeves, lay down his body, and worked hard. Over the years, Yu Chun's participation in labor was countless, spring plowing and autumn harvest had him, drought relief and flood control had him, disaster relief had him, bridge building and road paving had him, even when returning to his hometown to visit relatives, he participated in collective production labor with the villagers. When building the barracks of the Garrison Office, although Yu Chun's health was poor, he was always among the military and civilian workers, carrying stones, scooping sand, carrying wood, transporting bricks and tiles, working like everyone else. One morning, the comrades of the Garrison Office went to the river to scoop stones, and Yu Chun took the lead, standing in the cold deep water to work. On one side was his wife and three children, on the other side was his elderly mother who came to visit temporarily. The clear river water reflected the laboring figures of this three-generation family, who wouldn't be moved by this! One day, the Garrison Office helped the production team with summer harvest, and the comrades sincerely wanted him to rest at home. He agreed with his mouth, but after a while, he, under the scorching sun, carrying a bucket of hot water, rushed to the scene. The family members "complained" about him, the cadres "reproached" him, but he said seriously: "You can replace me in labor, but you can't replace me in reforming my thoughts!"

In recent years, although Yu Chun's position was high, his age was old, and his health was poor, his love for labor and his affection for the laboring people had not changed. Near the Garrison Office, there was a public toilet by the roadside, and he often used his morning time to clean it, year after year. He cleaned not just the toilet! He wanted to clean away the evil influence of China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing's advocacy of becoming an official and a lord! He wanted to clean away the stench of the official's airs left over for thousands of years!

Heart close to Chairman Mao, actions follow Chairman Mao closely.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Yu Chun, with his heart and actions, closely followed every battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Although he did not directly undertake the "three supports" and "two militaries" work, his thoughts were always on the front line of struggle, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, enthusiastically participating in this great revolutionary movement.

When the great proletarian cultural revolution mass movement just began to rise, Yu Chun, in a remote mountainous area, watched the development of the movement with immense joy. In the morning, he turned on the radio, listening to Chairman Mao's latest instructions from Beijing; at night, he concentrated on studying "Investigation Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan," understanding the spirit of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Next to Chairman Mao's words, "Standing at their front leading them? Or standing at their back criticizing them? Or standing against them opposing them?" he wrote: "These three attitudes are the best mirrors to examine our attitude towards the mass movement, a look and it's clear." Following that, next to the title of "'Very bad' and 'very good,'" he wrote a solemn oath: "Forever follow Chairman Mao, be a promoter of the mass movement."

Chairman Mao cared for and supported the Red Guards movement, and Yu Chun, with actual actions, followed Chairman Mao, loving the Red Guards, supporting the Red Guards. Walking Red Guards passing through the Garrison Office's station, Yu Chun led the family members and children to carry their backpacks, wash their clothes, and learn the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards. When the children of the Garrison Office went on the Long March, Yu Chun repeatedly instructed: "You must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the revolutionary mass movement to experience wind and rain, see the world, walk the old Red Army's road, and temper yourselves into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

As the cultural revolution movement deepened, the masses in the area where the Garrison Office was located were fully mobilized, and the situation was excellent. However, some mass organizations, due to the influence of bourgeois factionalism, were opposed to each other. Yu Chun actively and positively contacted the two factions of revolutionary masses, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them, promoting revolutionary great unity. One afternoon, he had a discussion with students of different views from a middle school. At the beginning, the students argued with each other, saying you are this ism, I am that ism. When it was difficult to resolve, Yu Chun patiently enlightened them: "Thousands of sins, ten thousand sins, all the sins are on China's Khrushchev. You love Chairman Mao, you should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Fighting 'internal wars' will only make friends hurt and enemies rejoice!" His attitude was sincere, making everyone nod in agreement, unanimously expressing: firmly stop the "internal war," unite, and fight the enemy together. The two factions of revolutionary masses held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and Yu Chun enthusiastically went to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting their revolutionary great unity.

On the eve of the establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Yu Chun, using various opportunities, more enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He repeatedly emphasized learning from the working class, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly opposing the reactionary "multi-center is no center" theory, welcoming the glorious birth of the provincial revolutionary committee. His actual actions of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply moved the revolutionary masses, and they praised Yu Chun: "Heart close to Chairman Mao, actions follow Chairman Mao closely."

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

In March 1968, during the period of the artillery's active members' conference studying Chairman Mao's works, Yu Chun had the honor of seeing our most red sun, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, twice!

Yu Chun will never forget, in that most happiest moment, his blood boiled, his red heart surged, with tears of happiness, looking up at Chairman Mao's affectionate and kind face, shouting thousands and thousands of times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!

"Don't rely on past merits, but create new ones." Yu Chun solemnly swore to Chairman Mao: Forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn until old age, do until old age, reform until old age, revolution until old age, closely follow Chairman Mao, forever advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

      《解放军报》编者按：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想，哺育了千千万万忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席的好干部。俞纯同志就是其中突出的一个。
    俞纯，是抗日战争时期参加革命的老同志。胜利以后，他遵循毛主席的教导，不居功，不骄傲，一直保持蓬勃的革命朝气。在身患癌症面临生命威胁的时候，他以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，更加刻苦地学习和宣传毛泽东思想，更加忘我地为党、为人民工作。他是全军同志、特别是老干部学习的好榜样。
    伟大领袖毛主席历来十分关心新干部的成长，也十分关心老干部的进步。在社会主义革命深入发展的新时期，毛主席提出培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，又提出了老干部保持无产阶级革命晚节的问题。这是毛主席的伟大战略思想，是对广大干部的深切关怀和期望。
    革命的老干部，是无产阶级政权的领导骨干，肩负着带领新干部的重任。老干部保持革命晚节，是关系到党和国家保持鲜红颜色的大问题，也是关系到我军变不变质的大问题。
    林副主席指示我们，要保持革命晚节，“最主要的，就是要实行毛主席所规定的接班人那五条。简单地概括就是要相信毛主席，要相信群众，和正确对待自己。”
    俞纯同志正是这样做的。他始终紧跟毛主席闹革命，年龄越大跟得越紧，永不停顿，永不迷航。他始终和群众心连心，勤勤恳恳为群众服务。他时刻不忘缺点，永远不记成绩，活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，学到老，改造到老。这样，他就老当益壮，永葆革命青春。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”我们要牢记毛主席的教导，“不要吃老本，要立新功”。要以俞纯同志为榜样，不断革命，越老越红，永远做无产阶级革命事业的坚强战士。
    毛主席一系列最新指示的灿烂光辉，普照五湖四海，新生的革命委员会，遍布六亿神州。在全国山河一片红的大好形势下，在迎接斗、批、改新高潮的战鼓声中，我们怀着无比激动的心情，向大家介绍一个被誉为活着的焦裕禄、永葆革命青春的毛主席的好干部——福建前线炮兵某部留守处政治委员俞纯同志的光辉事迹。
    “踏遍青山人未老”。
    贫农的儿子俞纯，在抗日战争最艰苦的岁月，踏上了革命的征途。二十六年来，在毛泽东思想哺育下，俞纯勇敢作战，勤奋工作，多次立功受奖，多次当选模范。社会主义革命时期，俞纯牢记毛主席的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，不居功，不骄傲，始终保持蓬勃的革命朝气，长期坚持用毛泽东思想教育群众，组织群众，和群众保持最广泛、最经常、最密切的联系，一直沿着毛主席的革命路线阔步前进。他立志把生命的每一秒钟都献给伟大领袖毛主席，献给人民。群众称赞他：
    “年纪越大跟毛主席越紧，
    身体越差革命干劲越足，
    职位越高心和群众越亲近，
    贡献越多越为人民立新功。”
    “生命是人民的，活一天就要战斗一天”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”俞纯在身患癌症，面临生命威胁的时候，以最深厚的无产阶级感情和惊人的毅力，刻苦学习毛主席著作；以高度的革命乐观主义精神和昂扬的斗志，忘我地为人民服务。他说：“生命是人民的，活一天就要战斗一天！”
    一九六一年春天，炮兵某团副政治委员俞纯突然病倒了，体重由一百三十多斤，急剧下降到八十多斤。经过反复诊断，结论是：结肠腺癌。
    俞纯面临着一场生与死的严峻考验。
    这时候，帝、修、反联合反华，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想；中国赫鲁晓夫大搞资本主义复辟，疯狂破坏毛主席革命路线；反革命修正主义分子彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线的流毒，还没有肃清，国内外阶级斗争异常尖锐复杂。这时候，全军以战斗的姿态，热烈响应林彪副主席发出的“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的伟大号召，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。俞纯以对毛主席的最大忠诚，勇敢地战斗着！
    “要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的话，字字值千金，句句重千斤，给了俞纯巨大的力量。他说：“只要心脏还跳动，就要学习毛主席著作；只要还有一口气，就要和人民共呼吸；只要身子还能动弹，就要朝着毛主席指引的方向前进！”
    在生命威胁面前，俞纯艰难地坐起来，倚在床栏上，坚持苦读毛主席著作。头晕了，就闭上眼睛默默背诵；肚子痛得厉害了，就高声朗读。他读起毛主席的书，是那样专心，那样入神，忘了劳累，忘了病痛。护士劝他休息，他说：“毛主席的书，我一拿起来就放不下。”他就是这样，怀着对毛主席最深厚的无产阶级感情，在病床上一字一句地通读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷。光芒四射的“老三篇”，他读得最多，想得最深，用得最好。一天，他又一次读完《为人民服务》，在“完全”“彻底”四个字旁边，重重地划上四个红圈。然后又写下了：“在生死关头，怎样才能做到‘完全’‘彻底’为全中国和全世界人民服务？”他思考着，反复地思考着。……
    在癌痛的折磨之中，俞纯怀着对毛主席的最大忠诚，争分夺秒地宣传毛泽东思想。俞纯曾经转过几个医院，他住在哪个病区，哪个病区学习毛主席著作的空气就浓厚；他在哪个支部，哪个支部政治思想工作就活跃。有一次，病区开支委会，俞纯是支委，当时正在发高烧，没有通知他。他知道后，硬撑着去参加，会上，他详细地提出了学习毛主席著作、抓好工休人员活思想的意见。直到连说话的力气也没有了，才被人架回病房。
    在癌痛的折磨之中，俞纯仍然按照毛主席的教导，“毫不利己专门利人”，忍着病痛，照顾其他病员。休养员们感动地说：“俞纯同志病最重，最需要别人照顾，但是他最关心别人。”就是在癌痛发作的时候，他也宁肯自己忍受痛苦，不愿去麻烦别人。一天深夜，俞纯癌痛又发作了，他想起白求恩同志生命垂危时，依然不顾自己而要军医去抢救别人的光辉形象，痛得满身大汗都没有吭一声。护士要去找医生，他连忙说：“医生明天还要工作，让他多睡会儿吧。”
    在生命威胁面前，俞纯也没有放松世界观的改造，没有放松对自己头脑里“私”字的斗争。他经常用“老三篇”来对照自己，发现一点私心，就坚决斗争。他说：“决不能把私心带到棺材里去。就是死，也要给毛主席留下一颗忠心。”
    不久，医院为俞纯做癌肿广泛切除手术。割去了两尺多肠子。手术成功了。
    对于癌症，当时有种说法，患者手术后的寿命，最长只有三年到五年，而且随时都有癌肿转移的危险。用毛泽东思想武装起来的俞纯，首先想到的是伟大领袖毛主席，想到的是革命事业。他说：“如何对待‘三年五年’的问题，是忠不忠于毛主席的问题。‘三年五年’，在共产党员的心目中，绝不是等死的信号，只能是战斗的信号，加紧为党工作的信号！”
    俞纯以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，加强锻炼，为早日出院继续为人民服务创造条件。
    手术后没几天，他出人意料地下床练习走路了。他一手捂着肚子，一手扶着墙壁，喘着粗气，淌着汗珠，终于迈出了可贵的第一步。这一步，表现了俞纯“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的革命英雄主义气概！这一步，表明了俞纯把有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务中去的彻底革命精神！这一步，表明了俞纯无限热爱毛主席，步步紧跟毛主席革命路线的耿耿忠心！
    俞纯在与癌症作斗争的过程中，始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于生命、重于生命的地位。是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给了他超人的勇敢和无穷的力量，使他战胜了癌症，战胜了死亡。两个月后，俞纯豪情满怀，英姿勃勃，奔向新的战斗岗位。
    “领导的责任，就是用毛泽东思想武装群众”
    俞纯身带雄文四卷，来到留守处任政治委员。他认真学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导。他认为，用毛泽东思想武装群众，是最根本的联系群众，是最大的政治。他说：“领导的责任，就是用毛泽东思想武装群众。”
    俞纯一到留守处，就一头扎到群众中去，调查访问。有的家属房间贴着胖娃娃骑鲤鱼的年画，有的家属谈论添置摆设，吃喝打扮。有着高度路线斗争觉悟的俞纯，发现这些现象，立刻意识到，这决不是什么生活小事，是把留守处变成“安乐窝”，还是办成毛泽东思想大学校，这是两条路线在留守处建设方向上的尖锐斗争。
    俞纯遵循毛主席的教导，从政治上建设留守处。他对干部们说：“家属工作和部队工作一样，都要抓住政治思想工作这个根本。如果只抓家务，不抓革命，就会迷失政治方向。我们可不能心中无战场啊！”他的话给了大家很大启发。干部们提高了认识，明确了方向，大抓政治思想工作。他们从阶级教育入手，针对家属的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，还组织家属开荒生产，集体劳动。家属们心往革命化上想，劲往革命化上使，她们说：家务，是革命的家务，应该充满毛泽东思想；带孩子，就是要培养无产阶级革命事业接班人。
      “正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”正当留守处沿着毛主席建军路线奋勇前进的时候，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起的大比武的风，也吹到了留守处。有的人受了资产阶级军事路线影响，说什么，留守处又不是连队，学政治，搞劳动，把人搞得那么紧张，没有必要。在这两条路线的激烈斗争中，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的俞纯，斩钉截铁地说：
  “高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗建设留守处的方向是绝对正确的。”他带着病痛，以战斗的姿态，一点一滴地往家属孩子头脑里灌输毛泽东思想。有一次，他要给家属作学习毛主席著作的辅导报告，事先作了充分准备。就在作报告的那天，他忽然腹痛不止，浑身发冷。干部们劝他休息，要代他讲课，俞纯说：“你们没有准备，还是我讲吧！不能因为我影响大家的学习。”在课堂里，俞纯大声朗读毛主席著作，认真讲解毛主席的伟大教导。直到讲完了，家属们才注意到他青一阵白一阵的脸色，才想到他是带着病来讲课的。她们感动极了：“我们的好政委啊，你为了宣传毛泽东思想，为了我们的思想革命化，花费了多大的心血！”俞纯鞠躬尽瘁，呕心沥血，每天工作学习都在十二小时以上，有时甚至十六七个小时。同志们劝他注意休息，他说：“为了宣传毛泽东思想，累死也是高兴的！”
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”长期以来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，为了复辟资本主义，让帝王将相、才子佳人的毒草戏纷纷出笼，向毛主席的革命文艺路线展开了疯狂进攻。在这场战斗中，俞纯表现了对毛主席革命文艺路线的无限忠诚。他说：“我们工农兵一定要占领舞台，把舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的红色阵地。”一九六四年，他亲自组织家属演出队，亲自参加修改演唱材料，亲自指导排练，亲自登台演出，热情歌颂闪耀着毛泽东思想的新人新事。有一次，俞纯参加合唱队，演唱《毛主席的战士最听党的话》，有人嫌不好唱，要换一个，俞纯不同意。他说：“这支歌，能充分表达革命战士对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，一定要唱好。”家属史学兰年龄大，文化低，参加演出有困难。俞纯耐心地和她讲解演出的意义，说：“我们革命家属、贫下中农就是要把帝王将相、才子佳人占领的舞台夺回来！”史学兰带着这个问题反复学习毛主席关于文艺为政治服务的论述，提高了路线斗争觉悟。为了熟记台词，她做饭时背，劳动时背，走路时背，睡在床上也背，直到把台词背得滚瓜烂熟。一天，她到生产队演出，因为晕车，呕吐不止。但一想到宣传毛泽东思想，顿时浑身充满力量，一下车就奔向舞台。几年来，家属演出队多次到部队、农村、城镇，热情歌颂毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席最新指示，受到广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。
    在毛主席革命路线的指引下，留守处成了一个坚强的战斗集体。她们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，闻风而动，步步紧跟。毛主席号召关心国家大事，她们就订报纸，听广播，主动了解社会上阶级斗争情况；毛主席号召
  “要斗私，批修”，她们家家活学活用“老三篇”，人人都在灵魂深处爆发革命；毛主席号召开展革命大批判，她们就出专刊，办广播，开大会，口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫；毛主席号召办学习班，她们立即行动，所有家属都是学习班的学员。每当毛主席的最新指示一发表，她们就立即学习，积极宣传；毛主席的最新指示一谱成歌曲，她们就立即教唱，很快流传开来。留守处真正成了红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    “关心群众生活，就是关心革命事业”
    俞纯在用毛泽东思想武装群众的同时，还牢记毛主席的教导：“要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，……就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。我们是这样做了么，广大群众就必定拥护我们，把革命当作他们的生命，把革命当作他们无上光荣的旗帜。”他说：“关心群众生活，就是关心革命事业；你关心群众生活越细致，越周到，群众关心革命事业就越自觉，越热情。干部把心拴在群众身上，群众就会把心拴在革命事业上。这样，群众的革命积极性就能充分调动，就能更认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事，更加热爱毛主席。”
    俞纯到职不久，上级决定给留守处修建营房。当时俞纯手术后遗症还很严重。为了选择有利于家属孩子不脱离劳动、不脱离群众、不占用耕地的营房地址，他废寝忘食，亲自带领工作人员，爬遍县城四周山头；为了多快好省地盖好营房，使家属们感受到党的温暖，激发革命热情，他不顾病痛，仔细了解本地区风力雨量的规律，察看水土流失情况；寻找百年的废墟，研究土墙承受风雨的能力。有一次，由于过度疲劳，他晕倒在山坡上。同志们把他送到卫生队，医生们又心痛又埋怨地说：“俞政委就知道关心群众，从来不知道关心自己，这回可该好好休息休息啦！”可是两小时以后，俞纯不见了，他悄悄地离开了卫生队，又为修建营房奔波去了。……
    营房建成了。这里的每一个房间，每一项设备，就连厨房里小小的炉灶，也凝结着俞纯的大量心血。为使炉灶少占地方，方便适用，俞纯利用休息时间，拖着瘦弱的身体，把自家炉灶拆了修，修了拆，反复试验，终于在墙角砌成一种三角形的炉灶。在灶门旁边，还特意留了一个放火柴的小方洞。一提起三角灶，家属们就感激地说：“我们的营房是俞政委用心血合着泥修成的。”
    俞纯关心群众生活，细致又细致，周到又周到。他要求自己：能想到的一定想到，能办到的坚决办到。有一次，家属汪义珍要去前方看望爱人。头天晚上俞纯就为她操心了：汪义珍有三个孩子，还要带些东西，公共汽车又开得早，弄不好会误车的。他挂着这桩心事，怎么也睡不安稳，天还没亮就起床了，推着自行车去帮助汪义珍运东西、拉孩子。走到汪义珍门口，一看表才四点钟。他想，汪义珍要在汽车上颠簸一天，让她多睡会吧！便坐在台阶上静静地等起来。一直等到五点钟，他才去敲门。汪义珍一看五点了，有点着慌。俞纯安慰她说：“不要紧，我算好了时间，来得及！”说着就帮助收拾东西，一直把她们送上汽车。汪义珍坐在车上，心里怎么也不能平静：俞政委替我想的比我自己想的还细啊！
    俞纯脑子里只有群众，没有“我”字的位置。有一年春天，他爱人生病住院。医院打来长途电话，说病情严重，叫他快去看看。到医院后，他首先探望的是留守处其他住院家属，关心地问她们学习毛主席著作的情况，病情怎样，生活上有没有困难，直到把所有住院家属看完问遍，最后才去看望自己的爱人。现在，家属们一提起这件事，就心潮翻滚。她们含着热泪说：“我们的好政委，是在用行动给我们讲用‘老三篇’啊！”
    俞纯遵照毛主席的教导，做到职位越高，心靠群众越近，感情跟群众越亲，为群众服务越勤，群众从俞纯身上感受到党的温暖，自觉地把心拴在革命事业上，“把革命当作他们无上光荣的旗帜”。
    有一年，美蒋匪帮阴谋窜犯大陆，前线部队加强战备。广大家属自动写信鼓励守卫在前线的丈夫，英勇杀敌，为人民立功。家属四中队还集体向党委写了决心书，坚定地表示：一旦战斗打响，立即奔赴前线，和广大指战员并肩作战。
    家属们在活学活用毛主席著作、狠抓自身革命化的同时，还把培养无限忠于毛主席的革命后代，看作是最大的为人民服务。家属郑金荣经常对孩子进行阶级教育。有一次，她给孩子做了件衣服，孩子嫌不好看，不愿意穿，她心里很难过。晚上，她在毛主席像前给孩子讲故事。说的是，解放前一个七岁的小姑娘，吃不饱穿不暖，跟着妈妈到处要饭。十冬腊月披着破麻袋片，晚上睡在破庙里，身上盖的是高粱秸，冷风吹来，冻得小姑娘哇哇大哭。夏天，小姑娘脖子上长了个毒疮，没钱买药，差点送了命……故事没讲完，孩子们就急着问：那个小姑娘现在还活着吗？郑金荣再也抑制不住夺眶的泪水，指着脖子上的疮疤说：“那个小姑娘，就是妈妈！是毛主席他老人家救了妈妈，你们要记住妈妈过去的苦日子，做毛主席的好孩子，永远忠于毛主席！”孩子们含着泪花激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    象防瘟疫一样防止官气，永保劳动人民本色
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    俞纯对毛主席这一伟大教导，有着深刻的理解。他说：“一个领导干部，必须毫不特殊，参加劳动，艰苦奋斗，象防瘟疫一样防止官气。只有身不离劳动，心不离群众，才能永保劳动人民本色，永葆革命青春。”建国以后，反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线。他们大搞军衔制，还在吃喝穿戴方面搞了许多特殊化的规章制度，企图把我军干部变成脱离劳动、脱离群众的官老爷。在这种情况下，俞纯牢记毛主席的教导，始终把自己摆在普通党员、普通一兵、普通劳动者的位置上，艰苦奋斗数十年如一日，和群众心心相印，息息相通。大家都说：他没有一点官架子，是个普通劳动者。
    为了有效地防止官气，俞纯永远把自己看作是劳动人民中的一分子。他认为，生活上的特殊，会助长特权思想；有了特权思想，就会越来越深地追求生活上的特殊，天长日久，就会导致政治上的蜕化变质。他说：“干革命，就不能图舒服，就不能怕吃苦。吃苦可以打天下，吃苦可以保江山。”多少年来，俞纯仍然象战争年代那样，过着艰苦的生活。他的一顶蚊帐补了二十六个补钉，一条被单补了三十四个补钉，但他爱如珍宝，继续使用，把这些东西看成是永不忘本的“备忘录”。同志们见他的体质虚弱，时常关切地劝他：“政委呵，你有病，可要多注意营养呀！”每当这种时候，他总是对大家说：“生活要同旧社会比，同贫下中农比，同世界上还没有解放的亿万人民比，粗茶淡饭是最好的营养。”即使在癌病最严重、最需要营养的时候，生活上也毫不特殊，医院给他安排“指定饮食”，他婉言谢绝了。他说：“一个领导干部，如果职位高了，身体也‘高贵’起来，在生活上搞特殊，只讲养身，不讲革命，就会脱离群众，就会变成修正主义。”
    为了有效地防止官气，俞纯给自己作了个死规定：长期坚持参加劳动。他参加劳动，决不是做做样子，而是卷起袖子，铺开身子，实实在在地干。多少年来，俞纯参加劳动的次数数不清，春耕秋收有他，抗旱排涝有他，抢险救灾有他，修桥铺路有他，即使回乡探亲，也和社员一起参加集体生产劳动。在留守处修建营房的时候，俞纯虽然身体不好，但他天天挤在军工民工当中，搬石头，捞沙子，扛木料，运砖瓦，同大家一样干。一天早上，留守处的同志们到河里捞石头，俞纯带头站在冰冷的深水里劳动。他的一边是爱人和三个孩子，一边是临时来看望他的老母亲。清澈的河水，映着这一家三代人的劳动身影，谁见了不受感动！一天，留守处帮助生产队夏收，同志们恳切地要他在家休息。他嘴里答应不去，可是不大一会，他顶着火辣辣的太阳，挑着一担开水赶到了。家属们“埋怨”他，干部们“责备”他，他却语重心长地说：“你们能代替我劳动，可不能代替我改造思想啊！”
    近年来，尽管俞纯的职位高了，年纪大了，身体差了，但他热爱劳动的习惯一点没变，对劳动人民的亲切感情一点没变。在留守处附近的路旁，有一个公共厕所，他经常利用早晨时间去打扫，数年来如一日。他打扫的何止是厕所！他是要把中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀、罗瑞卿所鼓吹的当官做老爷的恶劣影响，打扫得一干二净！他是要把几千年遗留下来的官老爷的臭架子，打扫得一干二净！
    心靠毛主席最近，行动跟毛主席最紧
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”俞纯对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，思想上热烈拥护，行动上步步紧跟，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边。他虽然没有直接担负“三支”“两军”工作，但思想却始终在斗争第一线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，满腔热情地投入了这场伟大的革命运动。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动刚刚兴起的时候，身在偏僻山区的俞纯，就以无比喜悦的心情，注视着运动的发展。早上，他打开收音机，聆听着从北京传来的毛主席的最新指示；深夜，他全神贯注地学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，领会毛主席无产阶级革命路线的精神。他在毛主席写的“站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”这句话旁边，写道：“这三种态度是检验我们对待群众运动的最好的镜子，一照就清楚。”接着，他在“‘糟得很’和‘好得很’”这一段的题目旁边，写下了庄严的誓言：“永远紧跟毛主席，当群众运动的促进派。”
    毛主席关怀和支持红卫兵运动，俞纯以实际行动紧跟毛主席，热爱红卫兵，支持红卫兵。步行串连的红卫兵途经留守处驻地时，俞纯带领家属孩子给红卫兵扛背包，洗衣服，学习红卫兵的革命精神。留守处的孩子长征时，俞纯千叮万咛：“你们要按毛主席的教导，到革命群众运动中去经风雨，见世面，走老红军的道路，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业接班人。”
    随着文化大革命运动的深入，留守处所在地区的群众充分发动起来了，形势一片大好。但是，有些群众组织由于受资产阶级派性的影响，互相对立。俞纯积极主动地接触两派革命群众，向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示，促进革命大联合。一天下午，他找一个中学不同观点的学生座谈。一开始，学生们就互相争吵，你说我是这个主义，我说你是那个主义。在难分难解的时候，俞纯耐心地开导他们：“千条罪，万条罪，条条罪状都在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。你们热爱毛主席，就应该按照毛主席的指示办事。打‘内战’，只能叫亲者痛，仇者快啊！”他态度诚恳，说得大家不住地点头，一致表示：坚决停止“内战”，团结起来，共同对敌。两派革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班，俞纯又热情地去宣传毛主席的最新指示，促进他们革命大联合。
    在福建省革命委员会成立前夕，俞纯利用各种机会更加热情地宣传毛主席的最新指示。他反复强调向工人阶级学习，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决反对反动的“多中心即无中心论”，迎接省革命委员会的光荣诞生。他无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的实际行动，深深地感动了革命群众，他们称赞俞纯：“心靠毛主席最近，行动跟毛主席最紧。”
    “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    一九六八年三月，毛主席的好干部俞纯，在参加炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会期间，两次见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席！
    俞纯永远也不会忘记，在那最最幸福的时刻，他热血沸腾，红心激荡，含着幸福的泪花，仰望着毛主席亲切慈祥的面容，千遍万遍地纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    “不要吃老本，要立新功”。俞纯庄严地向毛主席宣誓：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，学到老，做到老，改造到老，革命到老，紧紧跟着毛主席，永远沿着毛主席的革命路线，奋勇前进！
