The heroic people and armed forces of Laos, following their glorious victory of annihilating over 16,000 enemy troops during the dry season, have continued to employ the strategy and tactics of people's war during the first two months of the rainy season. They have relentlessly struck the enemy on all fronts, achieving numerous new victories and further consolidating and expanding the liberated areas.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that the strength of the people's army lies in the fact that "it divides itself into main force units and local force units. The former can execute strategic tasks at any time, while the latter's task is to cooperate with the militia and self-defense forces to defend the local areas and attack the enemy in the vicinity." During the first two months of the rainy season, the local forces and guerrilla units in various parts of Laos have demonstrated tremendous power, annihilating large numbers of the enemy. Apart from cooperating with the main forces in combat, they have also conducted independent operations, launching surprise attacks on the enemy. On July 29, the local forces and guerrilla units in Xieng Ngeun Province bravely launched a sudden attack on the headquarters of the 26th Battalion of the rightist Lao army, annihilating 39 enemy troops. On July 25, the local forces and people of Phongsaly Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy in the Nong Heng area, annihilating 109 enemy troops and liberating the Nong Heng area. Local forces and guerrilla units in various places have also cleverly laid minefields and set traps, creating a vast network to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy invading the liberated areas. On July 12, the guerrilla units in the Banang area of Phongsaly Province set a trap and captured 30 bandits raised by the Americans, seizing a batch of weapons.

During this rainy season, local forces and guerrilla units in various places have shown contempt for the modern aircraft of American imperialism, using light weapons to shoot down and damage many American aggressor planes. The local forces and people of Xieng Ngeun Province shot down three American planes with rifles in July alone. The local forces and guerrilla units of Sayaboury Province shot down five American planes with light weapons from May to July. These vivid facts once again prove Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive."

While the armed forces of Laos are widely attacking the enemy, they are also vigorously carrying out anti-bandit operations in the rear, further consolidating and expanding the liberated areas.

The so-called "special forces" directly raised by American imperialism are a band of armed counter-revolutionary bandits. They often parachute into the liberated areas by American helicopters to carry out sabotage activities such as harassment and looting, committing heinous crimes against the people in the liberated areas. Following the destruction of the enemy's bandit nests in Baty, Oudom, and Oudomxay during the dry season and the annihilation of a large number of bandits, the armed forces of Laos have achieved new victories in the first two months of the rainy season. According to statistics, more than 500 bandits were annihilated in Phongsaly, Xieng Ngeun, and Oudomxay Provinces in June and July alone. While vigorously carrying out anti-bandit operations, the armed forces of Laos have strengthened political propaganda work against the bandits, splitting and disintegrating the enemy, causing batch after batch of bandits to surrender. In Phongsaly Province alone, more than 110 bandits raised by the Americans surrendered to the people in June.

Under the heavy blows of the people and armed forces of Laos, American imperialism and its Lao lackeys are in a state of chaos. In a desperate struggle, they are on one hand intensifying savage repression of the people in the enemy-occupied areas, and on the other hand desperately recruiting cannon fodder, even forcibly conscripting civil servants into the army. However, the outrageous actions of American imperialism and its lackeys have aroused strong resistance from the people in the enemy-occupied areas, and the morale of the rightist army is also declining day by day. More and more rightist army soldiers are realizing that joining the armed forces of Laos is their only way out. In Savannakhet Province alone, 207 rightist army soldiers surrendered to the people in July and joined the people in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

At present, the heroic people and armed forces of Laos are advancing in victory. They are determined to smash all new military adventures of the enemy and achieve greater victories in the rainy season.

    运用人民战争战略战术　在各个战场上狠揍敌人
    老挝爱国军民雨季头两月战斗取得新胜利
    解放区进一步巩固和扩大，美帝及其走狗陷于一片混乱
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：英雄的老挝爱国军民继旱季取得歼敌一万六千多名的辉煌胜利之后，在雨季的头两个月内，运用人民战争的战略战术，继续在各个战场上接连打击敌人，取得了许多新胜利，进一步巩固和扩大了解放区。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出，人民军队之所以有力量，“还由于它将自己划分为主力兵团和地方兵团两部分，前者可以随时执行超地方的作战任务，后者的任务则固定在协同民兵、自卫军保卫地方和进攻当地敌人方面。”在雨季的头两个月里，老挝各地的地方部队和游击队显示了巨大的威力，歼灭了大批敌人。他们除了配合主力部队作战外，还独立作战，主动给敌人以出其不意的打击。桑怒省地方部队和游击队，七月二十九日勇敢地向老挝右派军队第二十六营营部发动突然袭击，一举歼敌三十九名。丰沙里省地方部队和人民七月二十五日猛烈袭击南杭地区的敌人，歼灭敌人一百零九名，并解放了南杭地区。各地地方部队和游击队还巧摆地雷阵，设置陷阱，到处布下天罗地网，给予窜犯解放区的敌人以大量杀伤。丰沙里省巴南地区的游击队七月十二日设置陷阱，一举俘虏美国豢养的土匪三十名，缴获武器一批。
    在这个雨季里，各地的地方部队和游击队，藐视美帝国主义的现代化飞机，使用轻武器击落击伤许多美国强盗飞机。桑怒省地方部队和人民仅七月份就用步枪击落美机三架。沙耶武里省地方部队和游击队从五月份到七月份用轻武器共击落美机五架。这些生动的事实，再一次证明毛主席的英明论断：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”
    老挝爱国武装力量在广泛出击同时，还在后方大力开展剿匪工作，进一步巩固和扩大了解放区。
    由美帝国主义直接豢养的所谓“特种部队”，是一支武装的反革命匪帮。它们常常是由美国的直升飞机空投到解放区，进行骚扰、抢劫等破坏活动，对解放区人民犯下了滔天罪行。老挝爱国武装力量继旱季捣毁敌人在巴提、乌代、乌怒等地的土匪巢穴，歼灭大批匪徒之后，在雨季的头两个月内又取得了新胜利。据统计，仅丰沙里、桑怒、乌多姆塞省六月和七月份就歼匪五百多名。在大力剿匪的同时，老挝爱国武装力量加强了对土匪的政治宣传工作，分化瓦解敌人，使一批又一批的土匪弃暗投明。仅丰沙里省六月份就有一百一十多名美国豢养的匪徒向人民投诚。
    在老挝爱国军民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义及其老挝走狗陷于一片混乱，为了进行垂死挣扎，它们一方面加紧野蛮镇压敌占区的人民，另方面极力搜罗炮灰，甚至强征公务员入伍。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗的倒行逆施，激起敌占区人民的强烈反抗，右派军队的士气也日益低落。越来越多的右派军队士兵认识到，投奔老挝爱国武装力量是他们的唯一出路。在沙湾拿吉省，仅七月份就有二百零七名右派军队士兵向人民投诚，并同人民一道参加抗美救国斗争。
    目前，英雄的老挝爱国军民正乘胜前进，他们决心粉碎敌人的一切新的军事冒险，在雨季里夺取更大的胜利。
