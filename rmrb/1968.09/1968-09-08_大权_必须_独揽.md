The entire nation is red, and the sun rises over the whole of China.
The great storm of the "January Revolution" marked the beginning of the struggle by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After twenty months of fierce struggle, the broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat have finally, on a national scale, seized back from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party the part of the Party, government, financial, and cultural power they had usurped. Look at China today: it is all the proletariat's domain!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against oppression. All of them are for the purpose of seizing power and keeping it."

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is concentrated on the question of power: the proletariat wants to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. The eighteen-year history of socialist New China has vividly proved this objective law of class struggle that is not subject to human will.

Power is the tool of class rule, the most important part of the superstructure, and the greatest of all powers. With power, one has everything. Without power, one loses everything. The great practice of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat tells us: after seizing power, the proletariat must "monopolize the great power" and firmly hold the reins in its own hands. This great power must never be forgotten for a moment; this great power must never be relaxed for an instant.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most dangerous figures attempting to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat are those representatives of the bourgeoisie who have usurped the Party, government, financial, and cultural power. "Once power is in hand, orders are issued." Isn't it the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who, using the part of the great power they have usurped, are pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and engaging in activities to restore capitalism?

In order to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism, the part of the great power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party must be seized back completely. The establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of the mainland, except Taiwan Province, proclaims that the great power of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party has been completely and thoroughly seized back by the proletariat.

Now, the "great power" is "monopolized" by the proletariat!

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat throughout the country must defend this great power, consolidate this great power, and "monopolize" this great power well. Chairman Mao has recently issued a great call to the nation to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. At present, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must fully utilize this great power to fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Winning this battle will further consolidate the red power of the proletariat.

To win this battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must also "monopolize the great power" and give full play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. Only in this way can this battle be won, fought well, and fought beautifully!

    “大权”必须“独揽”
    ——赞全国山河一片红
    辛午
    全国山河一片红，神州处处尽朝晖。
    伟大的“一月革命”风暴，揭开了“无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权”的序幕。经过二十个月的激烈斗争，广大的无产阶级革命派终于在全国范围内，从党内一小撮走资派的手中，夺回了为他们所篡夺的一部分党政财文大权。且看今日之域中：统统都是无产阶级的天下！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题：无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。社会主义新中国成立以来的十八年历史，生动地证明了这个不以人们意志为转移的阶级斗争客观规律。
    政权是阶级统治的工具，是上层建筑中最主要的东西，是一切权力中最大的权。有了政权，就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践告诉我们：无产阶级在取得政权以后，必须“大权独揽”，牢牢地把印把子掌握在自己的手中。这个大权，一时一刻也不能忘记；这个大权，一分一毫也不能放松。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的危害最大的资产阶级代表人物，就是那些窃取了党政财文大权的走资本主义道路的当权派。“一朝权在手，便把令来行。”党内一小撮走资派，不正是利用被他们篡夺的那部分大权，来推行资产阶级反动路线，进行复辟资本主义活动的吗！
    为了巩固无产阶级专政，为了防止资本主义复辟，对于被党内一小撮走资派所篡夺的那部分大权，必须统统夺回来。全国一片红，除台湾省以外各省、市、自治区革命委员会的全部成立，宣告党内一小撮走资派的大权已经全部、彻底地被无产阶级夺了回来。
    如今，“大权”由无产阶级“独揽”了！
    全国的无产阶级革命派，必须捍卫这个大权，巩固这个大权，把这个大权“独揽”好。毛主席最近向全国发出了认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大号召。当前，我们就要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，充分运用这个大权，打好斗、批、改这一仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。把这一仗打好，又将进一步巩固无产阶级的红色政权。
    要打好斗、批、改这一仗，也必须“大权独揽”，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。只有这样，这一仗才能打得赢，打得好，打得漂亮！
