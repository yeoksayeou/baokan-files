	We Welcome Such Intellectuals

	Editor,

	Chairman Mao's latest directive has shown the way for the proletarian educational revolution, and at the same time, it has pointed out the path for the transformation of intellectuals. It truly expresses the thoughts in our hearts as revolutionary soldiers.

	This year, our platoon has added eight new comrades. Most of them are from the countryside and are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. There are also two who have just graduated from middle and higher schools. They put down their books, picked up their guns, and came to the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, with different ideas of finding a way out, getting a gold-plated status, and becoming cadres.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, the party branch of the company promptly conducted education to rectify their motivation for enlisting. During the education, high school graduate Lin Honghai said: "From the day I enlisted, I wanted to be a technical soldier. When I was assigned to an infantry company, I felt a bit unhappy, thinking it was a waste of talent. Isn't this falling into the trap of the revisionist education line?" Based on this active thought, the party branch inspired everyone to consciously rise up and criticize the revisionist education line. During the great criticism, comrade Lin Honghai used his personal experience to denounce the harm of the bourgeois education line. He said with deep feeling: "The bourgeois education line pushed me into the swamp of revisionism, and it was Chairman Mao's proletarian education line that saved me out." Through the revolutionary criticism, comrade Lin Honghai decided to humbly learn from comrades of worker and peasant origin and to be a good student. Later, he actively paired up with me. Whenever we had heart-to-heart talks, he would strictly examine his own shortcomings and seriously reform his non-proletarian thoughts. Once, when cleaning the latrine, he voluntarily took the manure bucket. At noon and in the evening, he rarely rested on time. He was either writing programs for the company or drawing slides and revolutionary criticism cartoons. In a short few months, he and other comrades drew many cartoons and slides for the company and prepared many cultural programs. Recently, he was elected as a team committee member and also participated in the team's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. Now he has been transferred to work at the team club. Comrades all say that we welcome such intellectuals the most.

    我们欢迎这样的知识分子
    编辑同志：
    毛主席的最新指示，给无产阶级教育革命指明了方向，同时也给知识分子的革命化指明了出路。真是说出了我们革命战士的心里话。
    今年，我们班补充了八个新战友。他们大部分是从农村来的贫下中农子弟。也有两个是刚从中等高等学校毕业的学生，他们放下书本，拿起枪杆，抱着找出路、镀金、当干部的不同想法，来到了解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”根据毛主席的教导，连队党支部及时地对他们进行了端正入伍动机的教育。在教育中，高中毕业的新战士林红海说：“从入伍那天我就想当个技术兵，一分配我到步兵连队，就感到有点不高兴，认为是大材小用。这不正是中了修正主义教育的毒吗？”根据这一活思想，党支部启发大家自觉地起来批判修正主义教育路线。在大批判中，林红海同志用自己的切身体会，控诉了资产阶级教育路线的毒害。他深有体会地说：“资产阶级教育路线把我推向修正主义的泥坑，是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线又把我救了出来。”通过革命大批判，林红海同志决心虚心向工农出身的同志学习，甘当小学生。后来他主动找我结成一对红，每当和我谈心时，他总是对自己的缺点进行严格检查，认真地改造自己的非无产阶级思想。有一次掏大粪，他主动抢着去提粪桶。中午、晚上他很少按时休息，不是为连队编写节目，就是绘制幻灯片和革命大批判漫画。在短短的几个月中，他和其他同志一起为连队绘制了许多幅漫画和幻灯片，编排了很多文艺节目。前不久，他被选为团支委，还参加了团里的毛泽东思想宣传队，现在被调到团俱乐部工作。同志们都说这样的知识分子我们最欢迎。
