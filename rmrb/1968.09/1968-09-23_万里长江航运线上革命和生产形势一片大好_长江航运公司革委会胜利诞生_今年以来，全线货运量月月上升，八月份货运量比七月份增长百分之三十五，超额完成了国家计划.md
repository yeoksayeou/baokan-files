Under the radiant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situation on the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River navigation line is excellent. The revolutionary committee of the Yangtze River Navigation Company, the largest river navigation enterprise in our country, was born in victory on September 17.

The ship sails on the sea with the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of sailors and workers of the Yangtze River Navigation Company, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, under the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and fought bravely against China's Khrushchev and his agents, achieving one victory after another. In this excellent situation, a small handful of class enemies who refuse to perish incited and utilized bourgeois factionalism, attempting to sabotage revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The broad masses of sailors and workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with red hearts loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, used Mao's latest instructions as weapons to resolutely criticize the bourgeois reactionary theory of "multiple centers is no center," further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and powerfully promoting the birth of the revolutionary committee of the Yangtze River Navigation Company.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in struggle." The broad masses of sailors and workers on the entire Yangtze River navigation line have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply feeling the greatness of their responsibility. They said, we will not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and must fully give play to the leading role of the working class and seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The great leader Chairman Mao instructed us: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The revolutionary committees of the Yangtze River Navigation Company and its subordinate companies, port authorities, and other units are implementing streamlining administration in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. The revolutionary committees at all levels of the entire company have universally established a new style of close connection with the masses and wholeheartedly serving the people, and the members of the revolutionary committees have gone deep into the grassroots, vigorously promoting revolution and vigorously promoting production, receiving praise from the broad masses.

The excellent revolutionary situation in the Yangtze River navigation system has powerfully promoted the transportation and production of the entire line. Since this year, the cargo volume of the entire line has increased month by month. The cargo volume in August increased by 35 percent compared to July, exceeding the state plan.

    万里长江航运线上革命和生产形势一片大好
    长江航运公司革委会胜利诞生
    今年以来，全线货运量月月上升，八月份货运量比七月份增长百分之三十五，超额完成了国家计划
    据新华社武汉二十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的灿烂光辉照耀下，万里长江航运线上革命和生产形势一片大好。我国最大的江河航运企业——长江航运公司革命委员会已在九月十七日胜利诞生。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，具有光荣革命传统的长江航运公司的广大海员工人，在人民解放军支左部队的大力支持下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人进行了英勇的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在一片大好形势下，一小撮不甘心灭亡的阶级敌人煽动和利用资产阶级派性，妄图破坏革命大联合和革命三结合。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大海员工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，坚决批判了资产阶级反动的“多中心即无中心论”，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，有力地促进了长江航运公司革命委员会的诞生。
      伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”长江航运全线的广大海员工人反复认真地学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，深深感到自己责任的重大。他们说，我们决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，一定要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，认真搞好斗、批、改。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”长江航运公司及其所属分公司、港务局等单位的革委会，遵照毛主席的教导，正在认真实行精兵简政。全公司各级革委会普遍树立崭新的密切联系群众的、全心全意为人民服务的革命化作风，革委会成员深入基层，狠抓革命，猛促生产，受到了广大群众的称赞。
    长江航运系统革命的大好形势有力地促进了全线的运输生产。今年以来，全线货运量月月上升，八月份全线货运量比七月份增长百分之三十五，超额完成了国家计划。
