	“Look at the mountains turning red, and the forests all dyed.” The great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has brought about a brilliant holiday for seven hundred million people—the nineteenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

	The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is also a revolution to educate and transform people’s thinking with Mao Zedong Thought. To promote Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental purpose of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and it is also the great achievement that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat must necessarily attain.

	On the day when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is heading towards complete victory, the most prominent sign of the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought is that the main force of the working class has ascended to the stage of the superstructure and is leading the great mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is the first time in history, this is a great innovation without precedent, and this is a new development of Marxism-Leninism.

	Once the working class enters the battlefield of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure, it uses Chairman Mao’s series of latest instructions to unify the thoughts, steps, and actions of the broad masses. The working class follows Chairman Mao’s series of latest instructions the closest, learns the fastest, understands the deepest, uses the best, and is the most adept at using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and guide all their actions. The working class learns and applies Chairman Mao’s instructions in unity, learns a little and applies a little, speaks and acts, does not fire blanks, and works hard on the “apply” part. This revolutionary learning style of the working class indisputably proves that they are a powerful main force in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They are not only the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought but also the team that spreads the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. Wherever they go, study classes to educate and transform people’s souls with Mao Zedong Thought will bloom and bear fruit, Mao Zedong Thought will further enter people’s hearts, Mao Zedong Thought will firmly occupy the position there, and the masses there will be able to quickly liberate themselves from the big and small “independent kingdoms” of the bourgeoisie and push the struggle, criticism, and transformation there to new heights.

	Wherever the working class goes, all reactionary trends against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought retreat step by step, and all bad learning styles that directly violate Marxism are swept away. The revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao flourishes, and what appears before people is a vast expanse of red Mao Zedong Thought. The great liberation of the masses’ thinking and the great improvement of their political awareness are the results of the working class pushing the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought to a deeper level and spreading the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao to a broader world and teaching it to more and more revolutionary masses. The clichés spread by the bourgeoisie gentlemen that workers are “rough and uneducated” and “don’t understand theory” have been shattered by the great revolutionary practice of the working class, and their reactionary arrogance has been suppressed by the revolutionary masses who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought.

	Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the working class!

    工人阶级万岁
    红铁兵
    “看万山红遍，层林尽染”。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，迎来了七亿人民的光辉节日——中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在社会主义条件下无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，也是用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人的思想大革命。大立毛泽东思想，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，也是无产阶级文化大革命必然要取得的伟大成果。
    在无产阶级文化大革命走向全面胜利的今天，毛泽东思想大普及的最显著的一个标志，就是工人阶级主力军登上了上层建筑的舞台，领导斗、批、改的伟大群众运动。这是开天辟地的第一回，这是史无前例的伟大创举，这是马克思列宁主义的新发展。
    工人阶级一进入上层建筑斗、批、改的阵地，就用伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示去统一广大群众的思想、步伐和行动。工人阶级对毛主席的一系列最新指示跟得最紧，学得最快，领会得最深，用得最好，最善于用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，指导自己的一切行动。工人阶级对毛主席的指示学用一致，学一点，用一点，说到做到，不放空炮，在“用”字上狠下功夫。这种工人阶级的革命学风，无可辩驳地说明他们是活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动中一支强大的主力军，他们不仅是毛泽东思想宣传队，而且是毛主席倡导的革命学风的传授队。他们开到那里，那里用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人们灵魂的学习班就开花结果，毛泽东思想就进一步深入人心，毛泽东思想就在那里牢固地占领阵地，那里的群众就能够从资产阶级的大大小小“独立王国”里迅速解放出来，把那里的斗、批、改推向新高潮。
    工人阶级所到之处，一切反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动思潮节节败退，一切直接违反马克思主义的坏学风一扫而光，毛主席倡导的革命好学风蓬勃兴起，展现在人们面前的是一片红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新天地。群众的思想大解放，政治觉悟的大提高，都是因为工人阶级把毛泽东思想大普及推向纵深发展，把毛主席倡导的革命学风传播到更广阔的天地，传授给更多更多的革命群众的结果。那些资产阶级先生们散布的工人是“大老粗”“没有文化”“不懂理论”的滥调，被工人阶级的伟大革命实践粉碎了，他们的反动气焰被掌握了毛泽东思想的革命群众压下去了。
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！工人阶级万岁！
