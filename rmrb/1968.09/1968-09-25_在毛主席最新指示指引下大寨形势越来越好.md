In celebrating the one-year anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, reviewed the battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically hailed the red tide sweeping the nation and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as one year ago: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before." The situation in Dazhai is the same. Over the past year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the Dazhai Brigade has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, focused on revolution, promoted production, and achieved one victory after another, with the situation improving day by day. We have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a deep and sustained exposure and criticism of the entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines that Khrushchev in China has promoted in the countryside. The revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of community members, further consolidating the socialist position in the countryside. The revolutionary criticism has promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The self-awareness of the broad masses of community members in studying Mao Zedong Thought has never been as high as it is now, and the effect of studying has never been as significant as it is now. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as popular in our brigade as it is now.

The revolutionary high tide has driven the production high tide. The broad masses of community members in our brigade have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," using revolution to lead production, firmly guarding their posts, and fighting for every inch of land. In 1967, our Dazhai Brigade achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production; although this year we encountered a severe hailstorm disaster, the people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are as firm as steel. The broad masses of community members have displayed the revolutionary spirit of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and the fighting style of being brave and tenacious in continuous battles. They actively tended and replanted the crops, and quickly overcame the natural disaster. Now, the terraced fields under Tiger Head Mountain in our brigade are golden and radiant.

Every victory achieved by the Dazhai Brigade is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the red flag of Dazhai even redder and held even higher. The stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have given us more education, testing, and tempering than the past twenty years, making us understand more deeply that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the working people, not a single second can be without it. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no people of Dazhai, no new socialist Dazhai, and no everything of the working people! We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights. We must carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, learning a little and using a little, continuously promoting the thought revolution of the broad masses of community members, continuously focusing on revolution and promoting production, creating new and greater achievements, and presenting them as a gift to the 19th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China and to the great leader Chairman Mao!

    在毛主席最新指示指引下大寨形势越来越好
    山西昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部
    在欢庆伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东三大区一周年的时候，我们大寨大队党支部同贫下中农一道，回顾了无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，最热烈地欢呼全国山河一片红，最热烈地欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席早在一年前就英明地指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”我们大寨的形势也是如此。一年来，我们大寨大队在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺得了一个又一个胜利，形势越来越好。我们高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线，展开了深入持久的大揭发，大批判。革命大批判极大地提高了广大社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步巩固了农村社会主义阵地。革命大批判促进了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，广大社员学习毛泽东思想的自觉性从来没有象现在这样高，学习的效果从来没有象现在这样显著，毛泽东思想在我们大队从来没有象现在这样普及。
    革命的高潮，推动了生产的高潮。我们大队广大社员坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命统帅生产，坚守岗位，寸土必争。一九六七年，我们大寨大队农业生产夺得了特大丰收；今年虽然遇到了一场严重的冰雹灾害，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，志比钢坚。广大社员发扬“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，发扬英勇顽强、连续作战的战斗作风，积极扶苗补苗，及时抢种，很快战胜了自然灾害。现在，我们大队虎头山下的梯田里，一片金光灿灿。
    我们大寨大队所取得的每一个胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！无产阶级文化大革命，使大寨红旗显得更红，举得更高了。无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，给我们的教育、考验和锻炼，胜过了过去二十年，使我们更加深刻地懂得，毛泽东思想是劳动人民的命根子，一分一秒不能离。没有毛泽东思想，就没有大寨人，就没有社会主义新大寨，就没有劳动人民的一切！我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新高潮。我们一定要发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，学一点用一点，继续不断地促进广大社员群众的思想革命化，继续不断地狠抓革命、猛促生产，创造新的更大的成绩，向伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年国庆献礼，向伟大领袖毛主席报喜！
