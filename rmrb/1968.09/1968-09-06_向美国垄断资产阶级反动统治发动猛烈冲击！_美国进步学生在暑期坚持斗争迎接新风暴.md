	Launch a fierce assault on the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie!
	American progressive students persist in the struggle during the summer to welcome the new storm

	Many students go to factories to work and fight alongside workers, continuously raising their consciousness

	Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: Washington, D.C. - American progressive students have persisted in their struggle during this summer vacation, intensifying their preparations and organizational work to strive for a new wave of struggle in the upcoming academic year.

	In May of this year, American progressive students launched a wave of struggle that swept across the United States, opposing the Vietnam War, racial discrimination, political persecution, and demanding reforms in the education system. Together with the black people's armed resistance and the surging tide of workers' strikes, it powerfully struck at the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie.

	To welcome the new wave of struggle, American progressive students have done a great deal of preparatory and organizational work during this summer vacation. The students of Columbia University in New York City went on a large-scale strike in the spring, forcing the university to start the summer vacation early. Throughout the summer vacation, the strike committee of Columbia University students has continued the struggle. Since June, they have started a summer school, introducing the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, the history of the American black liberation struggle, and the history of the Chinese revolution to a wide range of students, conducting political education. They have also united a wide range of students to persistently struggle against the reactionary school administration. Fearing that students will launch a larger-scale struggle once the fall semester begins, the American reactionary authorities instructed the Columbia University president Kirk, who was strongly opposed by students, to retire early and announced that Cordier, the former administrative assistant of the United Nations Secretary-General, would serve as the acting president, attempting to alleviate student anger. However, Columbia University students saw through this deception, exposing Cordier as the executioner whose hands are stained with the blood of the Congolese (Zaire) national hero Lumumba, and brewing a new struggle.

	During the summer vacation, many American progressive students went to factories to work, further immersing themselves in the workers' masses. Through working and fighting alongside the workers, students have learned about the workers' exploitation and oppression, received education, and pointed out that after laboring, they "better understood the power of the American working class," recognized the role of the working class in production, and realized that "only the working class can overthrow the bosses." The working class is the main driving force of the revolution. In Chicago, these students also actively participated in the spontaneous strikes by black bus drivers and others.

	During the summer vacation, American progressive students have further strengthened their organizational work. For example, middle school students in New York City, after a summer of effort, formed a city-wide unified organization - the High School Alliance. They proposed eleven demands, including "immediately remove all police and plainclothes police from schools; immediately stop recruiting military personnel in high schools," and planned to hold a large-scale strike in all city high schools after the fall semester begins. Some students also joined the self-defense committees in the black neighborhood of Harlem.

	Facing the impending new wave of the American progressive student movement, the American reactionary ruling clique exclaimed that it "will encounter more storms." The head of the American intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hoover, worried that there would be "two, three more Columbias (Universities)," shouting hoarsely that local authorities and police "should not be complacent." However, all the conspiracies and tricks of the American reactionaries can only accelerate the awakening of American students, leading to an even greater wave of struggle.

### 向美国垄断资产阶级反动统治发动猛烈冲击！  美国进步学生在暑期坚持斗争迎接新风暴

    向美国垄断资产阶级反动统治发动猛烈冲击！
    美国进步学生在暑期坚持斗争迎接新风暴
    许多学生到工厂同工人共同劳动共同战斗，觉悟不断提高
    新华社三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国进步学生在今年暑假中坚持斗争，加紧进行准备和组织工作，为在新的学年中掀起新的斗争高潮而努力。
    今年五月，美国进步学生掀起一个席卷美国的反对侵越战争、反对种族歧视、反对政治迫害和要求改革教育制度的斗争高潮，同黑人武力抗暴斗争和日益高涨的工人罢工浪潮一起，有力地冲击了美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
    为了迎接新的斗争高潮，美国进步学生在今年的暑假中做了大量准备和组织工作。纽约市哥伦比亚大学学生今年春天的大罢课，曾迫使这个学校提前放了暑假。在整个暑假中，哥伦比亚大学学生的罢课委员会一直坚持进行斗争。他们从六月起就办起了暑期学校，向广大学生群众介绍马列主义的基本原理，美国黑人解放斗争史，中国革命史等，向学生进行政治教育。他们还团结广大学生群众，同反动的校方进行坚持不懈的斗争。由于害怕学生在秋季一开学发动更大规模的斗争，美国反动当局授意遭到学生强烈反对的哥伦比亚大学校长柯克提前退休，并宣布前联合国秘书长的行政助理科迪埃担任代理校长，妄图借此缓和学生的愤怒情绪。但是，哥伦比亚大学学生看穿了这场骗局，揭露出科迪埃是双手沾染了刚果（金）民族英雄卢蒙巴的鲜血的刽子手，并酝酿发动一场新的斗争。
    在暑假中，有许多美国进步学生到工厂去劳动，进一步深入到工人群众中去。在和工人群众共同劳动、共同战斗中，学生们了解了工人群众受剥削、受压迫的现状，受到了教育，他们指出，劳动后“更认识了美国工人阶级的力量”，认识到工人阶级在生产中的作用，认识到“只有工人阶级才能推翻老板们”，工人阶级是革命的主要动力。在芝加哥，这些学生还积极参加了黑人公共汽车司机等举行的自发性罢工。
    在暑假中，美国进步学生还进一步加强了组织工作，如纽约市的中学生经过了一个暑假的努力，组成了全市统一性组织——中学联盟，他们提出了“立即从学校中撤走一切警察和便衣警察；立即停止在中学招收军事人员”等十一项要求，并且酝酿在秋季开学后在全市中学举行大罢课。一些学生还参加了黑人区哈莱姆区的自卫委员会。
    面临即将到来的美国进步学生运动的新高潮，美国反动统治集团惊呼，它“将碰到更多的风暴”。美国特务组织联邦调查局的头子胡佛担心美国会出现“两个、三个哥伦比亚（大学）”，声嘶力竭地叫嚷地方当局和警察“不要掉以轻心”。但是，美国反动派的一切阴谋诡计，只能促使美国学生加速觉醒，从而掀起更大的斗争高潮。
