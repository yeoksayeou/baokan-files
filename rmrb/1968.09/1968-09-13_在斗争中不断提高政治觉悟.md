During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, my comrades elected me to the workshop management group to oversee production. I thought, since my fellow workers chose me to participate in managing the factory, it was to represent the working class and manage the factory well. No matter how heavy the burden on my shoulders, I must carry it well and fully demonstrate the leading role of the working class. Therefore, in my work, I put all my effort into it, and things went smoothly. However, recently, due to many people being pulled away to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, there were fewer people in the workshop than before, but the tasks assigned were much greater than before. Not only were the quality requirements high, but the time requirements were also tight. I felt a heavy burden in my mind, always fearing that I wouldn't be able to complete the tasks and bring disgrace to the working class.

The Revolutionary Committee's leaders timely discovered my ideological problems and studied Chairman Mao's teachings with me: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "The masses have boundless creative power." They also studied Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "The people are the creators of history. The people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, become the most intelligent and the bravest, and can display boundless strength." Chairman Mao's words are truly powerful, immediately brightening my mind. Yes, I should go to the masses, discuss with them, and tap into the collective wisdom and strength of the working class.

After discussions in our workshop management group, we decided to hand over all political and production tasks to the masses, conducting a "thought mobilization" and encouraging the masses to engage in extensive discussions. As soon as the tasks reached the work teams, the workers immediately began discussions. Some comrades said, "In the past, Khrushchev and his agents in our factory always looked down on us workers, treating us as 'living tools,' imposing 'control, restriction, and pressure' on us, and pushing 'material incentives' like this and that. But in the end, the tasks were still not completed. Today, Chairman Mao trusts us workers so much, letting us workers manage the factory. We must not let Chairman Mao down and must stand tall and work hard! Yu Gong can move mountains, and our working class has even greater strength. As long as we put politics in command and actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, there is no task we cannot complete." The "thought mobilization" formed a living classroom for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and a lively revolutionary criticism meeting. Some work teams even brought in the walking capitalists and bourgeois technical "authorities," fiercely criticizing the black goods they peddled, such as "expert management" and "material incentives," greatly arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses. Finally, at the workshop meeting, everyone unanimously declared: In the face of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there is no task that cannot be completed, no difficulty that cannot be overcome. We will not eat or sleep until we complete the task, to bring glory to the working class and to make Chairman Mao proud.

With this, the spirit of the masses was indescribable! Everyone, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep proletarian feelings, and with immense hatred for Khrushchev, went to the machines as if going to the battlefield, launching a mass production competition. For example, the task of the arm drill, previously the air compressor's left cover drilling (holes), had a class output of five to six, and at most did not exceed eight. Now, everyone puts proletarian politics in command, goes to the machine with a sense of enemy presence, drilling one more part is like firing a cannon at Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, competing with each other, and the class output reached twenty.

These vivid examples deeply educated me. "The masses are the real heroes," the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought will display boundless strength. Only by arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and continuously enhancing the political awareness of the working masses can we fully demonstrate the great strength of the working class in changing heaven and earth and show the leading role of the working class.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously enhance its political awareness in the struggle." I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, continuously enhance my political awareness, and fully demonstrate the leading role of our working class.

	Shanghai Tractor Factory's revolutionary workers recently successfully experimented with a new static electricity spraying technology. This new technology can spray paint over 140 types of parts on hand-held cultivators, with a paint utilization rate of about 90%. This is a worker operating the switch for trial spraying.

    在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟 
    北京第一通用机械厂工人　李兰柱
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，同志们把我选进了工段管理小组，负责抓生产。我想，大家选我参加管理工厂大事，就是要我代表工人阶级把工厂管理好，不管肩上的担子多么重，都必须把它挑好，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。所以，在工作中我就使劲地干，干得很顺畅。可是，近来，由于抽走了许多人参加毛泽东思想宣传队，工段上的人比过去少了，而下达的任务却比过去大大增加了，不仅质量要求高，而且时间要求紧，思想上就背起了个大包袱，总怕完不成任务，给工人阶级丢丑。
    革委会的负责人及时发现了我的思想问题，就和我一起学习毛主席的教导：“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”。还学习了林副主席的指示：“人民群众是历史的创造者。人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量”。毛主席的话真是威力无穷，立刻使我的心里亮堂起来。对，到群众中去，和群众一起商量，发挥工人群众的集体智慧和力量。
    我们工段管理小组研究后，决定把政治和生产任务统统交给群众，来个“思想大练兵”，发动群众进行广泛讨论。任务一下达到班组，工人们立即展开了讨论。有的同志说，过去中国赫鲁晓夫和他在我厂的代理人，从来就看不起我们工人，把工人看成“活工具”，对我们工人实行“管、卡、压”，拚命搞“物质刺激”，这个奖那个奖的，可是，最后任务还是完不成。今天，毛主席这么信得过我们工人，由咱们工人来管工厂，咱们可不能辜负毛主席他老人家的信任，一定要挺起腰杆子干哪！愚公能移山，咱们工人阶级比愚公的劲可大多了，只要我们突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，就没有完成不了的任务。“思想练兵”会形成了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，形成了一场生动的革命大批判会。有的班组还把走资派和资产阶级的反动技术“权威”带来，狠批他们所贩卖的“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”等黑货，大大激发了工人群众的革命积极性。最后在车间大会上，大家一致表示：在用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人面前，没有完不成的任务，没有攻不下的难关，我们不吃饭，不睡觉，也要完成任务，为工人阶级争光，给毛主席争气。
    这样一来，群众的那股子劲头，就别提啦！人人带着无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，上机床如同上战场，展开了一场群众性的生产大竞赛。例如摇臂钻任务，过去空气压缩机上的左盖打眼（钻孔），班产量是五到六个，最多也不超过八个，现在大家突出无产阶级政治，带着敌情上机床，多钻一个零件就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的一发炮弹，你追我赶地竞赛着，班产量达到二十个。
    这些生动的事例，深深地教育了我。“群众是真正的英雄”，群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就会发挥出无穷无尽的力量。只有用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，不断提高工人群众的政治觉悟，才能充分发挥出工人阶级改天换地的伟大力量，显示出工人阶级的领导作用。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我一定遵照毛主席的教导，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，充分发挥我们工人阶级的领导作用。
