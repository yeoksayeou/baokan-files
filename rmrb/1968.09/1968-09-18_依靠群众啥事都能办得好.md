Relying on the Masses, Everything Can Be Done Well

Zhai Shende, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of Heishan Coal Mine, Zibo City, Shandong Province

After the revolutionary committee was established, I was responsible for production. In April, the production service department informed me that the stockpiled pit props were only enough for one month, and the purchased timber would take another two months to arrive. This meant that the entire mine would have to shut down for a month, waiting for the timber to arrive before resuming work. Upon hearing this news, the class enemies were secretly pleased, and I was very anxious. I hurriedly gathered a few cadres to discuss and find solutions, but after several meetings and brainstorming sessions, none of the proposed methods were feasible. As the pit props dwindled day by day, I was at my wits' end and requested that the revolutionary committee hold a meeting to solve this problem.

The chairman of the revolutionary committee, worker representative Chen Ruyin, carefully understood the situation and said to me, "Old Zhai, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war.' When we do things, if we do not believe in the masses and do not rely on the masses, we can accomplish nothing!" Old Chen's words made me see the light. Indeed, why not ask the worker masses to solve the problem when encountering difficulties? Following this, Old Chen and I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line together, criticized the revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev about the "backwardness of the masses," and realized that not believing in the masses and not relying on the masses was due to the lingering poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism. Old Chen immediately helped me convene a meeting with workers, grassroots cadres, and technical personnel, sharing the stockpile situation with everyone and asking for their ideas and suggestions.

Upon hearing that the pit props were insufficient, the workers were stirred and expressed their determination, saying, "We will not let the enemy laugh at us. We must implement Chairman Mao's instructions on 'further economizing to make revolution' and, with the spirit of self-reliance, solve the difficulties and show our loyalty to Chairman Mao with practical actions. We must not stop production." Everyone eagerly proposed suggestions, ideas, and measures, putting forward many practical and feasible measures such as "expanding substitutes," "strengthening recovery," and "improving reuse rates." Old Chen also helped us mobilize the worker masses at the district and team levels to implement these measures. In the process of implementation, the worker comrades, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, used their spare time to collect discarded steel bars to replace pit props, reducing the consumption rate of pit props by fifty percent and ensuring normal production.

Through this incident, I deeply felt that having worker representatives is good, and with the strong leadership of the working class, the revolutionary committee can forever stay connected with the masses.

    依靠群众啥事都能办得好
    山东省淄博市黑山煤矿革委会委员　翟慎德
    矿革委会成立后，我分工抓生产。四月份，生产服务部门告诉我，库存的坑木只够用一个月，采购的木料还得两个月才能运到。这样，全矿就得停工一个月，等木材运到才能开工。听到这个消息，阶级敌人暗地里高兴，我心里非常着急，急忙和管生产的几个同志到仓库里翻过来，算过去，坑木确实只够用一个月。怎么办？我按照过去的习惯，找了几个干部开会研究，想办法，可是开了几次会，想了几个办法，都没有行得通。眼看坑木一天天减少，我急得团团转，要求革委会开会解决这个问题。
    矿革委会主任、工人代表陈汝银同志，详细了解了情况之后，对我说：“老翟，毛主席教导我们：‘革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。’咱办事，不相信群众，不依靠群众，啥也办不成啊！”老陈一席话，说得我心里亮堂堂。是啊，遇到困难为什么不去请工人群众解决呢？接着，老陈和我一块学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“群众落后”等修正主义谬论，使我认识到：遇事不相信群众，不依靠群众，这是中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义流毒没有肃清。老陈立即帮我召开有工人、基层干部和技术人员三结合的座谈会，把库存的底子交给大家，请大家想办法，出主意。
    工人同志们一听说坑木不够用，群情振奋，纷纷表决心说：“我们决不让敌人看笑话，我们一定要落实毛主席关于‘要进一步节约闹革命’的指示，本着自力更生的精神，解决困难，以实际行动向毛主席敬献忠心，说什么也不能停产。”大家争先恐后地提建议，想办法，出主意。提出“扩大代用”、“加强回收”、“提高复用率”等许多切实可行的措施。老陈又帮助我们到区队、班组去发动工人群众，落实这些措施。在落实过程中，工人同志们以工人阶级高度的革命责任感，利用业余休息时间，到处收集废旧钢筋代替坑木，使坑木消耗率降低百分之五十，保证了正常生产。
    通过这件事，使我深深体会到：工人代表就是好，有工人阶级的坚强领导，革命委员会就能永远不脱离群众。
