The red sun shines on the Tian Shan Mountains, and golden light is cast over the grasslands. A vibrant red flag waves in the wind at the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist outpost. Newly born revolutionary committees, it is Chairman Mao's blood that nourishes you; newly born revolutionary committees, it is Mao Zedong Thought that makes you stand tall and firm. You are the power organ of the three-in-one combination, bearing the dual burdens of revolution and production, leading the revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao forward bravely. You are the organ of dictatorship to suppress the class enemy, not allowing them to disrupt and sabotage. All the monsters, demons, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, let them all perish! Carry forward the Party's fine style, closely linked with the masses, with military and civilian unity as one, the power of the revolutionary three-in-one combination is boundless. Cherish you as one's own eyes, defend you, willing to sacrifice one's life. Whoever dares to touch you, we will break their spine! The red sun shines on the Tian Shan Mountains, and golden light is cast over the grasslands. A vibrant red flag will forever fly high at the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist front.

    誓死捍卫红色政权
    新疆军区某部　吕春堂红日照天山，金光洒草原，一面鲜艳的红旗，在反帝反修前哨迎风招展。新生的革命委员会啊，是毛主席的心血把你灌溉；新生的革命委员会啊，是毛泽东思想使你立地顶天。你是三结合的权力机构，肩挑革命、生产两副重担，领导着革命群众，紧跟毛主席奋勇向前。你是镇压阶级敌人的专政机关，决不容许他们破坏、捣乱，什么牛鬼蛇神、帝修反，叫他们统统完蛋！发扬党的优良作风，和群众息息相关，军民团结如一人，革命的三结合威力无边。爱护你，象爱护自己的眼珠，捍卫你，愿把生命来献，谁胆敢动你一根毫毛，就把它的脊骨砸断！红日照天山，金光洒草原，一面鲜艳的红旗，永远飘扬在反帝反修前沿。
