More than two years since the Mobutu puppet regime came to power in Zaire, it has actively aligned itself with American imperialism, further betraying the national interests of Zaire. Internally, it has tightened its fascist dictatorship. Under the brutal plunder, exploitation, and oppression of American imperialism and its lackey, the Mobutu regime, the people of Zaire are living in misery, struggling on the brink of poverty and hunger. As a result, public discontent is boiling over, and resistance is rising.

Workers Suffer Exploitation

Due to the continuous dumping of "surplus" goods by the United States into Zaire, the economy of Zaire has been severely damaged, factories are closing down one after another, farmers are going bankrupt in large numbers, and the number of unemployed is increasing dramatically. According to reports, in the capital Kinshasa, under the rule of the Mobutu puppet regime, half of the city's population is unemployed. Many of those lucky enough to find jobs have pitifully low wages, often going months without pay, living from hand to mouth. Facing the strong dissatisfaction of the workers, the Mobutu regime hypocritically promised to increase workers' wages by forty percent, but at the same time, it devalued the Zaire currency by sixty-six percent. Therefore, workers' actual income has actually decreased.

Farmers Suffer Torment

Under the rule of the Mobutu puppet regime in the rural areas of Zaire, farmers lead equally miserable lives. Due to the dumping of large quantities of "surplus" agricultural products by the United States, farmers are going bankrupt, and many are forced to leave their villages and flock to the cities, joining the ranks of the urban unemployed, becoming an important source of cheap labor for foreign monopolies. Before Mobutu came to power, Zaire could still export rice, potatoes, and cotton, but now these items have to be imported in large quantities from the United States. Currently, in the vast rural areas of Zaire, farmers lack salt, essential daily necessities, and especially medicines. Many farmers are tormented to death by poverty and illness. The above facts expose the lies in Mobutu's claim that "1968 is the year of agriculture in Zaire, and efforts will be made to change the agricultural situation in Zaire."

    蒙博托傀儡集团统治下的刚果（金）
    刚果（金）蒙博托傀儡集团上台两年多来，对外积极投靠美帝国主义，进一步出卖刚果（金）民族利益，对内加紧实行法西斯独裁统治。在美帝及其走狗蒙博托集团的残酷掠夺、剥削和压榨下，刚果（金）广大人民生活在水深火热之中，在贫困和饥饿线上挣扎。因此，民怨沸腾，反抗四起。
    工人受剥削
    由于美国不断向刚果（金）大量倾销“剩余”物资，使刚果（金）经济遭到严重破坏，工厂纷纷倒闭，农民大批破产，失业人数剧增。据报道，在蒙博托傀儡集团的统治中心金沙萨，失业人数占了这个城市人口的一半。许多侥幸谋得职业的人，工资也低得十分可怜，有的经常几个月领不到工资，朝不保夕。面对工人的强烈不满，蒙博托集团曾假惺惺地答应增加工人工资百分之四十，但同时又把刚果（金）货币贬值百分之六十六，因此，工人的实际收入反而减少了。
    农民遭折磨
    在蒙博托傀儡集团统治下的刚果（金）农村，农民过着同样悲惨的生活。由于美国倾销大批“剩余”农产品的结果，农民纷纷破产，许多农民被迫离开农村涌进城市，参加城市的失业大军，成为外国垄断资本家的廉价劳动力的重要来源。在蒙博托上台前，刚果（金）还可以出口大米、土豆和棉花，而现在这些东西都要从美国大量进口。现在在刚果（金）广大农村，农民没有盐吃，缺乏必需的日用品，更缺乏药品。许多农民在贫病交迫中被折磨死去。上述活生生的事实，彻底戳穿了蒙博托所宣称的“一九六八年是刚果（金）农业年，要致力于改变刚果（金）农业状况”的骗人鬼话。
