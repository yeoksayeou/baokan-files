	The spit of traitors cannot extinguish the blazing flames of armed revolution.

	Storms are rising across five continents, and massive waves are surging across four seas. The flames of armed revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning fiercely. Millions upon millions of oppressed people are raising the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," taking up arms to fight bravely against imperialism and its running dogs for the independence and liberation of their nations.

	Facing this excellent global revolutionary situation, the revolutionary peoples of all countries are filled with joy and enthusiasm. However, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, like imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, is facing a dire situation. They are constantly howling in despair and launching vicious attacks on the armed struggles of the peoples of various countries. Not long ago, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionists, the *Izvestia*, once again loudly proclaimed that "the diversity of struggle methods and means is a characteristic of modern national liberation revolutions," claiming that one should not "overemphasize" armed uprisings. They even audaciously attacked the oppressed peoples taking up arms against imperialism and their own reactionary regimes, labeling it as "organizing rebellions," and cursed the Chinese people for "defending any uprising movement—including those against advanced regimes."

	These traitors are grinding their teeth at the armed revolutions of the peoples of various countries.

	What is this "diversity of struggle methods and means"? What is this "not overemphasizing armed uprisings"? In essence, it is to make the revolutionary peoples of various countries abandon armed struggle.

	The great Lenin said: "If the oppressed class does not strive to learn to handle weapons and acquire weapons, it only deserves to be treated as a slave." The peoples of various countries, through their own revolutionary struggles, are increasingly recognizing the great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique still attempts to peddle their so-called "peaceful transition" revisionist goods to the revolutionary peoples of various countries, which is completely blind.

	The Soviet revisionist traitors slander the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries as "rebellions." This is the genuine tune of imperialism and reactionaries. All reactionary forces always call the people's resistance "rebellions." Weren't the mutineers of the *Potemkin* called "rebels" by the tsar and executed or exiled? Wasn't the great Bolshevik Party also called a "troublemaker" by the tsar? The Soviet revisionist traitors are parroting here, which only shows that they are of the same ilk as imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

	What is particularly absurd is that these traitors even call the armed revolutions of some countries' peoples "against advanced regimes." What a big accusation! What are the so-called "advanced regimes" in your mouths? Aren't they the traitorous regimes led by that anti-China black hand Indira Gandhi, who you praise as the flag-bearer of the "non-aligned policy"? Aren't they the fascist regimes led by that butcher Suharto, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people, whom you hail as "national leaders" and "revolutionary leaders"? Aren't they the puppet regimes led by that lackey of the U.S. imperialists, Mobutu, whom you crown as anti-imperialist and anti-colonial "heroes"?

	So, your providing large amounts of rubles and weapons to these reactionaries to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Indian people, the Indonesian people, and the Congolese people is a kind of "advanced" and just action. This is utterly absurd!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary."

	The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's vicious curses against the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries prove nothing but that they are thorough counter-revolutionaries.

	Let the Soviet revisionist traitor clique of jumping jacks howl! The great storm of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will one day bury them along with U.S. imperialism and its running dogs!

    叛徒的唾沫扑不灭武装革命的烈火
    中国人民解放军海军某部副艇长  韩玉仁
    班长、学习毛主席著作积极分子  宋国安
    五洲起风暴，四海卷巨澜。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的武装革命烈火正在熊熊燃烧。千千万万被压迫人民，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，为了争取民族的独立和解放，纷纷拿起武器，同帝国主义和它们的走狗，进行着英勇的斗争。
    面对这一片大好的世界革命形势，各国革命人民无不欢欣鼓舞。而苏修叛徒集团却同帝国主义和各国反动派一样，如象大难临头，不断对各国人民的革命武装斗争，发出绝望的嚎叫和恶毒的攻击。不久以前，苏修的喉舌《消息报》又大肆叫嚷“斗争方式和方法非常多样性是现代民族解放革命的特点”，说什么不能“偏重于”“武装起义”。它甚至放肆地攻击被压迫人民拿起武器造帝国主义和本国反动派的反的革命行动，是“组织叛乱”，咒骂中国人民“为任何的起义运动——其中也包括针对先进政权的——进行辩护”。这伙叛徒对于各国人民的武装革命简直是咬牙切齿。
    什么“斗争方式和方法的非常多样性”，什么不能“偏重于”“武装起义”，说穿了，无非是要各国革命人民放弃武装斗争。
    伟大的列宁说过：“被压迫阶级如果不努力学会掌握武器，获得武器，那它只配被人当作奴隶使唤。”各国人民从自己的革命斗争实践中，越来越认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理。苏修叛徒集团还企图向各国革命人民推销他们的所谓“和平过渡”的修正主义黑货，完全是瞎了眼睛。
    苏修叛徒把各国人民的革命斗争诬蔑为“叛乱”。这是地地道道的帝国主义和反动派的腔调。一切反动势力总是把人民的反抗叫做“叛乱”。“波将金”号的起义者，不是就被沙皇作为“叛乱分子”而处死和流放的吗？伟大的布尔什维克党，不是也曾被沙皇称作“乱党”吗？苏修叛徒在这里鹦鹉学舌，只能表明他们同帝国主义和各国反动派完全是一路货。
    特别荒唐的是，这些叛徒竟然把一些国家的人民的武装革命说成是“针对先进政权”。好大的罪名！你们嘴里所谓的“先进政权”都是些什么东西？不就是被你们称颂为“不结盟政策”旗手的那个反华黑干将英迪拉·甘地“领导”的卖国政权吗？不就是被你们吹捧为“民族领袖”和“革命领导人”的那个双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的刽子手苏哈托“领导”的法西斯政权吗？不就是被你们封为反帝反殖“英雄”的那个美帝走狗蒙博托“领导”的傀儡政权吗？
    这样说来，你们用大量的卢布和军火“援助”这些反动派镇压印度人民、印尼人民、刚果（金）人民的革命斗争，倒是一种“先进”的正义行动了。真是混账透顶！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”
    苏修叛徒集团对各国人民革命斗争的恶毒咒骂，除了证明他们是彻头彻尾的反革命派之外，还能有什么别的结论？
    让苏修叛徒集团这伙跳梁小丑去嚎叫吧！亚、非、拉地区民族解放运动的伟大风暴，终有一天要把他们连同美帝国主义及其走狗全部埋葬掉！
