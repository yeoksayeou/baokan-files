Japanese progressive friends continue to warmly hail the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese worker friends six years ago.

The secretary-general of the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Itabe Shozo, pointed out that the Japanese people are currently, under the great guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, striving hard for the victory of the Japanese revolution. At this time, the publication of Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese worker friends has great significance and has greatly encouraged the Japanese people.

Itabe said: We must solve a series of important problems facing the Japanese revolution. We must sum up the revolutionary practice of the Japanese people, draw lessons from it, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Komoto revisionist group, and establish a proletarian revolutionary line in politics, ideology, and organization.

Itabe said, in the anti-American patriotic struggle, the Japanese people have greatly raised their consciousness, and their fighting spirit is more ardent.

Tetsuo Sawamura, a revolutionary worker from a machinery factory in eastern Tokyo, said: "The personal inscription of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, shows his concern for Japanese workers. This inscription will undoubtedly have a very profound impact on the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese and other peoples. This inscription has greatly encouraged the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people of Japan. We Japanese workers are determined to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and fight to the end."

Tetsuo Sawamura said: "After studying Chairman Mao's inscription, I deeply feel that we must more seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and concretely apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the practice of revolutionary struggle."

Kosuke Kojima, a university student who has been studying Mao Zedong Thought while participating in the anti-American patriotic struggle, said: "The great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao, has deeply moved me with his concern for the Japanese working class and revolutionary people. I am determined to devote all my efforts to the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people."

He said, now, Japanese patriotic students are fighting side by side with revolutionary workers, opposing American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, striving to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and striving for the liberation of the Japanese nation and people. The Japanese working class and revolutionary people will never forget Chairman Mao's inscription. As long as we advance bravely along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will surely push the Japanese revolution to victory.

Japanese revolutionary people are striving to combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, and are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Komoto revisionist group.
