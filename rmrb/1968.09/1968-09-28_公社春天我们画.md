We listen to Chairman Mao's words,
The mountains listen to our words,
The southern slopes are planted with peaches, apricots, and pears,
The northern slopes are sown with paulownia and tea.
The mountains stand tall with cypresses,
The gardens are beautiful with green bamboo.

The barren hills are dressed in green,
The mountains are adorned with flowers and fruits in the sunset glow.

We listen to Chairman Mao's words,
The waters listen to our words,
A leap-forward pond is dug in front of the village,
A red-flag dam is built behind the village.
The ditches crisscross like a spider's web,
Irrigation is automated,
A water reservoir and power station are built,
Electric lights illuminate the homes of the commune members.

We listen to Chairman Mao's words,
The land listens to our words,
Silver hoes dig out high-yield fields,
Iron plows turn over low-yield depressions.
Scientific farming is implemented as a model,
The "Eight-Character Constitution" is strictly followed.
The red flowers of Dazhai bloom everywhere,
Striving to surpass the "Guidelines" with big strides.

We listen to Chairman Mao's words,
Our hearts are red, our eyes are bright, and our spirits are high,
A thousand-pound burden feels light,
We fear neither mountains of knives nor seas of fire.
We are pioneers in the cultural revolution,
We trample underfoot the ghosts and snakes.
The earth is our paper, the hoe is our pen,
We paint the spring of the commune!

    公社春天我们画
    安徽来安县长山公社  马成忠
    我们听毛主席的话，
    山听我们的话，
    南岭种上桃杏梨，
    北坡播下桐和茶，
    山间苍松挺风立，
    园内翠竹美如画。
    秃岭披上绿衣裳，
    满山花果挂彩霞。
    我们听毛主席的话，
    水听我们的话，
    村前挖口跃进塘，
    庄后打道红旗坝，
    沟渠纵横如蛛网，
    自流灌溉水利化，
    修座水库安电站，
    电灯照亮社员家。
    我们听毛主席的话，
    地听我们的话，
    银锄挖出高产田，
    铁犁翻走低产洼。
    科学种田办样板，
    “八字宪法”狠狠抓。
    大寨红花遍地开，
    争超“纲要”大步跨。
    我们听毛主席的话，
    心红眼亮干劲大，
    千斤担子不觉重，
    刀山火海全不怕，
    文化革命当闯将，
    牛鬼蛇神踩脚下。
    大地当纸锄当笔，
    公社的春天我们画！
