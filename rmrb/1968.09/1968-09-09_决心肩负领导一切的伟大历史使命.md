Inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers, revolutionary family members, and the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at the Beijing Mining Bureau were overjoyed to hear the great news that the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, both on the frontlines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism in southwest and northwest China, had been simultaneously established, marking a significant step towards a nationwide red victory. Everyone was ecstatic, spreading the news to each other. Filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary fervor, they took to the streets at night, braving the rain to march in celebration of the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Tibet and Xinjiang! They enthusiastically shouted slogans like "Long live Chairman Mao!" that echoed through the valleys and reverberated in the skies.

After the march, the revolutionary workers held an all-night discussion. Everyone excitedly said: This is a great joy in the political life of the 700 million people of our country. In the face of this excellent situation, we must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of never forgetting class struggle and, with unyielding struggle, consolidate this victory and develop this victory!

Revolutionary miners expressed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have entrusted the working class with a great historical mission. We will not let down the expectations of the old man. We will definitely, in the educational revolution and in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the superstructure in all fields, and in carrying out every item of work in Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, shoulder the great historical mission of leading everything.

The news of the nationwide red victory reached the Mu Cheng Jian Mine of the Beijing Mining Bureau. The joyous shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" resonated through the night sky. The revolutionary miners, who had been eagerly awaiting this great day, braved the rain to hold meetings and marches, post slogans, print joyous reports, and hold all-night discussions. The mine's broadcast room was packed with people, and each production section and team rushed to express their resolve to Chairman Mao, vowing to contribute with actual actions to the National Day celebrations.

The revolutionary workers and family members of the Men Tou Gou Coal Mine were gathered in the auditorium watching a performance when the radio broadcast the joyous news of the nationwide red victory. The venue immediately erupted in celebration, and the miners organized a parade to spread this heartening news to the working faces underground. The workers of the sixth team, who had just started their night shift, said: We workers are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively participate in the high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation, and better shoulder the great historical mission of the working class leading everything.

The night-shift workers at the Chang Gou Yu Mine heard that there would be an important broadcast at 8:30 PM. They all put on their work clothes and sat in the mine cars, listening intently to the broadcast, sharing the joy of the nation's celebration. With revolutionary fervor and the joy of victory, they marched to the working faces underground, ready to engage in the coal-mining battle.

The responsible comrades from each mine and factory participating in the bureau's political work conference held all-night discussions and meetings to discuss how to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and welcome the high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation. Many comrades expressed: We must resolutely carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, seriously fight the battle of struggle-criticism-transformation, and make the revolutionary committees play an even greater revolutionary role.
