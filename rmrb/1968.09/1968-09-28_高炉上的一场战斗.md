    The water tank of the No. 4 blast furnace in the ironmaking workshop of Hangzhou Iron and Steel Plant malfunctioned, and a serious accident was imminent. The entire blast furnace equipment was about to be damaged, and personal safety was also threatened. However, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers successfully carried out the task of eliminating the fault—

    A Battle on the Blast Furnace

    Not long ago, the water tank of the No. 4 blast furnace in the ironmaking workshop of Hangzhou Iron and Steel Plant malfunctioned, causing the red-hot coke inside the furnace to violently spew out from the slag outlet, with coal gas flames extending more than two meters. If the fault was not promptly eliminated, the entire blast furnace equipment would be severely damaged, and personal safety would be threatened.

    To eliminate the fault, the blast furnace had to be shut down, but according to the production characteristics of the blast furnace, shutting it down would result in significant losses. What should be done? The only solution was to quickly open the vent valve to release the wind, and the fire would come out. However, the coke inside the blast furnace was shooting out like machine gun bullets from the slag outlet, and the coal gas flames were getting bigger and bigger. The high temperature of over a hundred degrees made it impossible for anyone to approach the vent valve.

    Could one stand by and watch the national property suffer losses? No, absolutely not! The workers on the scene firmly declared: "To protect national property and ensure the safe operation of the blast furnace, the wind must not be stopped, and the fault must be eliminated." The workers rushed forward bravely, but the scorching air waves pushed them back several times. Workers tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought were not to be daunted. Young worker Zheng Zhonghao rushed forward without hesitation. The flying coke dust blinded his eyes, and the coke fireballs pelted him from all directions. The high-temperature air waves made it hard for him to breathe, and the flames burned his clothes. None of this mattered to him. He was determined to open the vent valve, no matter the cost. "For the safe operation of the blast furnace and the safety of my class brothers, even if I am burned to death by the furnace, I am willing."

    The steel rope on the vent valve jumped out of the pulley, and Zheng could not pull it at all. He was extremely anxious. At this moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by enemies." He felt an endless surge of strength. He pulled and kicked, persevering in the battle. With the support of his comrades, he finally forcibly opened the vent valve.

    The battle ended in victory, and the No. 4 blast furnace continued to pour out molten iron. Smiles of victory appeared on everyone's faces. The workshop presented a scene of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

    杭州钢铁厂炼铁车间四号高炉的水箱发生故障，眼看严重事故就要发生，整个高炉设备将受到破坏，人的生命安全也受到威胁。但工人们在毛泽东思想的指挥下，胜利地进行着排除故障的——
    高炉上的一场战斗
    不久前，杭州钢铁厂炼铁车间四号高炉的水箱发生故障，使炉内通红的焦炭从出渣口猛烈喷出，煤气火苗伸出二米多长，如果不及时排除，整个高炉设备就会受到严重破坏，人的生命安全也受到威胁。
    要排除故障，高炉就得停风，但是，根据高炉的生产特点，一停风就将带来很大的损失。怎么办？唯一的办法就是迅速扳开放风阀，把风放掉，火就会出来。可是，高炉里焦炭象机枪子弹一样，从出渣口劈哩拍啦的喷射出来，而且正对着放风阀，煤气的火焰愈来愈大，上百度的高温，使人无法接近放风阀。
    能眼看着国家财产遭受损失而不顾吗？不能，绝对不能！在场的工人同志坚决表示：“为了保护国家财产，保证高炉安全生产，风，决不能停，故障一定要排除。”工人们奋不顾身地冲了上去，灼热的气浪几次把人们推回来。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼、用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人是难不倒的。青年工人郑仲浩毫不迟疑地冲了上去。飞扬着的炭灰迷住了他的眼睛，焦炭的火球劈头盖脑地向他打来，高温的气浪压得他喘不过气来，火舌把他的衣服烧焦了，这一切，他都毫不介意，下定决心，不怕牺牲，一定要把放风阀放下来。“为了高炉安全生产和阶级兄弟的生命安全，即使把我烧死在炉旁，我也心甘。”放风阀上的钢绳跳出了滑轮，小郑怎么也拉不动，心里焦急万分。这时候，他想到毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，浑身增添了无穷的力量。他手拉脚踏，坚持战斗，在同志们的支援下，终于强行扳开了放风阀。
    战斗胜利结束，四号高炉又不断地倾吐着铁水。人们的脸上浮起了胜利的微笑。车间里呈现一片抓革命促生产的景象。　齐忠东
