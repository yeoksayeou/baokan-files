Inspired and driven by the great momentum of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Weihai Flat Glass Factory in Shandong Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have demonstrated the boundless wisdom and strength of the working class, achieving the outstanding result of completing the annual production plan four months ahead of schedule. The quality of the products has significantly improved, and production costs have been greatly reduced.

The revolutionary workers of the Weihai Flat Glass Factory have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instruction: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." They have actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, carried out a revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "material incentives" and "profit-first" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and firmly established Mao Zedong Thought.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," the revolutionary workers of this factory have, through revolutionary criticism, focused on class struggle. They have timely exposed the evil plots of class enemies, uncovered a handful of class enemies who sabotaged the revolution and production, boosted the morale of revolutionary workers, and crushed the arrogance of class enemies. Production has been steadily increasing. In May, despite using inferior coal, they still overfulfilled the state plan by 12.2%. The revolutionary workers of this factory have also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction on "streamlining administration," simplified the organizational structure and reformed the irrational management system of the workshops through revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary workers of this factory have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "let political and ideological work take command" and to "follow the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's way of training technical personnel from among the workers," formulated a plan for technical personnel to work closely with workers through revolutionary criticism. Technical personnel have been working in the workshops for long periods, learning from the workers, and workers have also participated in design work. They have broken through the reactionary technical "authority" of the bourgeoisie, old dogmas, and frameworks, taken the initiative, and boldly innovated. They have improved production equipment and processes, increasing production efficiency by 30%.

    威海平板玻璃厂的广大革命职工牢记毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，开展革命的大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，大立了毛泽东思想。
    这个厂的广大革命职工遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，通过革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争，及时揭露了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，揪出了一小撮破坏革命和生产的阶级敌人，大长了革命职工的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，生产日日上升。五月份在烧次煤的情况下，还超额完成国家计划百分之十二点二。这个厂广大革命职工还根据毛主席的“精兵简政”的教导，通过革命大批判精简了机构，改革了车间不合理的管理体制。
    这个厂的广大革命职工根据毛主席“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的教导，通过革命大批判，制订了技术人员与工人相结合的计划。技术人员长期下车间顶班劳动，向工人学习，工人也参加搞设计。他们冲破了资产阶级反动的技术“权威”的洋教条、旧框框，自己动手，大胆革新，改进了工艺设备，使生产效率提高了百分之三十。
