	Heartiest Congratulations on the New Great Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China
	(Statement by the Central Committee Delegation of the Communist Party of Burma)

	Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: The Central Committee Delegation of the Communist Party of Burma issued a statement on September 12th, extending heartiest congratulations on the new great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Heartiest Congratulations on the New Great Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China
	(Statement by the Central Committee Delegation of the Communist Party of Burma)

	With boundless excitement, we have learned of the extremely good news that the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were established on September 5th.

	The establishment of the Revolutionary Committees in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region indicates that, except for Taiwan Province, Revolutionary Committees have been successfully established throughout China.

	This good news not only greatly encourages the broad masses of the Chinese people but also greatly encourages Marxist-Leninists, revolutionary people, and all those who sincerely strive for progress throughout the world.

	After fierce, complex, and arduous class struggles, this new great victory achieved throughout China not only further consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat in China but also greatly strengthens the great rear base of the world proletariat and revolutionary people.

	This victory provides the most fundamental guarantee for the further achievements of new victories in the ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	This is a new great victory over the revisionists led by the Chinese Khrushchev, over the reactionaries within China, over the modern revisionists led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, and over the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

	These reactionary elements have shamelessly spread rumors, claiming that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has caused China to disintegrate and head towards collapse. But today's new great victory has once again exposed the reactionary faces of these rumor-mongers to the people of the world.

	This new great victory is a great victory of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the great thought of Mao Zedong, and it is also a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. It is a great victory for the seven hundred million Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, young students, and Communist Party members who are infinitely loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong and who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively every day.

	At the same time as achieving this great victory, victories have also been achieved in various fields such as the economy, science, and culture.

	These victories are increasingly influencing the entire world.

	The more these victories are achieved, the more the great thought of Mao Zedong (which is the sole guide to achieving the aforementioned victories) will have a great influence on the world proletariat and revolutionary people.

	Under this influence, revolutions are developing extensively in various countries.

	The modern revisionist group led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, the imperialist group led by U.S. imperialism, and the reactionaries of various countries are extremely afraid of this. They hate and fear the great thought of Mao Zedong to the extreme. They maliciously slander the great thought of Mao Zedong and shamelessly attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is personally led by the world people's leader Chairman Mao.

	As a result, the modern revisionist group, the imperialist group, and the reactionaries of various countries have suffered one defeat after another. In the future, they will certainly suffer a complete defeat and ultimately meet their doom.

	The new great victory achieved by China today was not unexpected. From the very beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, we have completely believed that it would definitely achieve victory.

	Therefore, we firmly believe that in the future, just as the new great victory has been achieved today, in the struggle to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, in organizational work, economic work, and in various fields such as science and culture, new victories will definitely be achieved.

	Let the revisionists, imperialists, and reactionaries of various countries tremble before these victories!

	Let these victories add new strength to the world proletariat and revolutionary people!

	Workers of the world, unite!

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

	Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong!

	Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao!

	Central Committee Delegation of the Communist Party of Burma

    最热烈地祝贺伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利
    （缅甸共产党中央代表团的声明）
    新华社十八日讯　缅甸共产党中央代表团十二日发表声明，最热烈地祝贺伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利。声明全文如下：
    最热烈地祝贺伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利
    （缅甸共产党中央代表团的声明）
    我们怀着无限兴奋的心情，得悉西藏自治区革命委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会九月五日成立的极其美好的消息。
    西藏自治区革命委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会的成立表明，全中国除台湾省以外都已胜利地成立了革命委员会。
    这一好消息不仅极大地鼓舞了中国广大人民，而且也极大地鼓舞了全世界的马克思列宁主义者、全世界革命人民和全世界真诚地要求进步的人们。
    经过激烈、复杂和艰巨的阶级斗争以后，在全中国范围内取得的这一新的伟大胜利，不仅更加巩固了中国的无产阶级专政，而且极大地加强了世界无产阶级和世界革命人民的后方大基地。
    这一胜利为正在继续开展的中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进一步取得新的胜利提供了最根本的保证。
    这是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的走资派，对中国国内的反动分子，对勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的现代修正主义者，对美帝为首的帝国主义者和各国反动派所取得的新的伟大胜利。
    这些反动家伙可耻地造谣，说什么伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命使中国四分五裂，走向崩溃。但今天这个新的伟大胜利，使这些制造谣言的坏家伙们的反动嘴脸再一次暴露在世界人民的面前。
    这个新的伟大胜利，是当代马克思列宁主义——伟大的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，也是毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，也是无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想、每天非常积极地学习和运用毛泽东思想的七亿中国工农兵、青年学生和中国共产党员的伟大胜利。
    在取得这个伟大胜利的同时，在经济、科学、文化等各个方面，也取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    这些胜利日益巨大地影响着全世界。
    愈是取得这些胜利，伟大的毛泽东思想（这是取得上述胜利的唯一的指针）就愈是对世界无产阶级和世界革命人民产生极大的影响。
    在这种影响之下，各国革命正在广泛的发展。
    对此，以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的现代修正主义集团、以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团和各国反动派十分害怕。他们对伟大的毛泽东思想恨得要死，怕得要命。恶毒地诽谤伟大的毛泽东思想，无耻地攻击世界人民的领袖毛主席亲自领导的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    其结果是，现代修正主义集团、帝国主义集团和各国反动派遭到了一个又一个的失败。今后它们肯定会一败涂地，最后走向灭亡。
    今天中国所取得的新的伟大胜利不是预想不到的，伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命一开始，我们就完全相信它一定取得胜利。
    因此，我们坚信，今后将如目前所取得的新的伟大胜利一样，在为争取进一步巩固无产阶级专政而作的斗争方面，在组织工作、经济工作和科学文化等各方面，定会取得新的胜利。
    让各国修正主义者、帝国主义者和各国反动派在这些胜利面前发抖吧！
    让这些胜利为世界无产阶级和世界革命人民增添新的力量！
    全世界无产者，联合起来！
    伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    缅甸共产党中央代表团
    一九六八年九月十二日
