The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Beijing University of Technology has held a short-term Mao Zedong Thought study class for propaganda team members, combining study with struggle, and applying what they learn immediately, with good results.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Beijing University of Technology, in order to better grasp and implement the Party's policies towards intellectuals, and to better use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals, has followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the course of struggle." Recently, it jointly organized a short-term Mao Zedong Thought study class for propaganda team members.

After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered Beijing University of Technology, it resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, led everything with Mao Zedong Thought, grasped the fundamentals, thoroughly mobilized the masses, and opened up a new situation for the educational revolution at Beijing University of Technology, making the university present a vibrant revolutionary scene.

Facing this good situation, the propaganda team members deeply realized that to better implement the Party's proletarian policies towards intellectuals, they must first study and master the Party's policies towards intellectuals; to use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals, they must first consciously arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and strengthen their own ideological transformation. Only in this way can they overcome difficulties and impatience in working with intellectuals, and only in this way can intellectuals better accept the re-education of the working class. A member of the workers' propaganda team said: "Now we are to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school and give intellectuals re-education. To adapt to this changed situation, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and continuously improve our political consciousness. Otherwise, we will certainly not be able to lead or educate well."

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought study class was held in response to the urgent demands of the broad masses of team members and the needs of the current struggle. This study class focused on solving three problems: first, seriously studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the Party's policies towards intellectuals; second, fully playing the leading role of the working class; third, learning from the great achievements of the Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution and correctly handling individual Red Guards who have made serious mistakes. During the study, emphasis was placed on linking with one's own thoughts and work reality, sharing experiences, lessons, and how to proceed. To avoid affecting work while giving all team members the opportunity to participate in the study, the study class divided all team members into two groups: half a day of study, half a day of work, with the two groups alternating, and inviting comrades from the previous class who studied well to give typical reports to the next class. In this way, they studied while fighting, mutually inspiring each other, applied what they learned immediately, and achieved immediate results. The propaganda team members' political consciousness and policy level generally improved. At the same time, they overcame difficulties and impatience. They said: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the highest level. As long as we do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do as Chairman Mao says, we will definitely be able to complete the glorious mission history has entrusted to us and carry out the educational revolution well!" Propaganda team member Liu Shumin used to get annoyed when she heard Red Guards talk about their achievements and was not enthusiastic towards them. Therefore, some Red Guards also distanced themselves from her, and she felt very frustrated. This time, after studying Chairman Mao's recent series of important instructions in the study class, her mind was enlightened. She said: "In the past, I didn't want to listen to them talk about their achievements, which was wrong. They have achievements, and this is a fact. Although some people made mistakes in the later stages of the movement, this is the result of the poisoning of the revisionist educational line. We should enthusiastically help them and guide them to achieve new merits in revolutionary struggles, and not let personal feelings replace the Party's policies." Soldier Liu Cheng recalled in the study class the achievements of the Red Guards in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution and the situation he saw after entering the school. He deeply felt: "In my class, the vast majority of Red Guards have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao. Whenever Chairman Mao issues a new instruction, they don't eat or sleep, study and propagate all night. They write big-character posters criticizing the bourgeoisie until late at night, without any complaints. These are the places we should learn from."

Through the study class, the members of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team greatly improved their political consciousness and policy level. They are determined to better use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals and, together with revolutionary young people and revolutionary intellectuals, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the educational revolution to the end!

    认真学习党的政策不断提高政治觉悟
    用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育
    驻北京工业大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队，举办短期的宣传队员毛泽东思想学习班，边学习、边战斗，学了就用，效果很好
    本报讯　驻北京工业大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，为了更好地掌握和执行党对知识分子的政策，更好地用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，最近联合举办了宣传队员短期毛泽东思想学习班。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻北工大以后，坚决落实毛主席一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想领导一切，狠抓了根本，深入地发动了群众，为北工大的教育革命打开了崭新的局面，使北工大呈现一派生气勃勃的革命景象。
    面对一派大好形势，宣传队队员深切地认识到：要想更好地执行党对知识分子的无产阶级政策，自己必须首先很好地学习和掌握党的知识分子政策；要想用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，首先必须自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，加强自身的思想革命化。这样才能克服在做知识分子工作中的畏难和急躁情绪，也才能使知识分子更好地接受工人阶级的再教育。工人宣传队的一位队员说：“现在要我们领导学校的斗、批、改，给知识分子以再教育。要适应这种变化了的情况，我们必须努力学习毛主席一系列最新指示，不断提高自己的政治觉悟。否则，是万万领导不好、教育不好的。”
    工人毛泽东思想学习班，就是根据广大队员的迫切要求和当前斗争的需要而举办的。这次学习班，着重解决三个问题：一，认真学习、深刻领会毛主席一系列最新指示和党的知识分子政策；二，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用；三，学习红卫兵小将在文化大革命中所建立的丰功伟绩，正确对待个别犯有严重错误的红卫兵小将。学习中，强调联系自己的思想实际和工作实际，谈经验，谈教训，谈以后怎么做。为了不影响工作，而又能使所有队员都有机会参加学习，学习班把全体队员分成两班：半天学习，半天工作，两班轮流交换，并请上一班学习好的同志，到下一班去作典型报告。这样边学习，边战斗，相互启发，学了就用，收到了立竿见影的效果，宣传队队员的思想政治觉悟和政策水平普遍有了提高。同时，克服了畏难和急躁情绪。他们说：“忠于毛主席，这就是最高水平。只要我们处处按毛主席指示办事，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，我们就一定能完成历史赋予我们的光荣使命，把教育革命搞好！”宣传队员刘淑敏，过去一听红卫兵小将谈自己的成绩就烦了，对他们不够热情。因此，一些红卫兵小将也同她疏远了，她心里很苦闷。这次，她在学习班里学习了毛主席最近发出的一系列重要指示后，心里豁亮了。她说：“我过去不愿听他们谈功绩，是不对的，人家有功绩这是事实。虽然某些人在运动后期犯了一些错误，这也是修正主义教育路线对他们毒害的结果，我们应当满腔热情地帮助他们，引导他们在革命斗争中立新功，不能用个人感情代替党的政策。”解放军战士刘成在学习班里，还同大家一起回忆了两年来文化大革命中红卫兵小将所建立的功勋和进校后所看到的情况。他深有感触地说：“我在的那个班，绝大多数红卫兵小将，对毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情，毛主席每发表一个最新指示，他们饭不吃，觉不睡，连夜学习、宣传。他们写大字报批判资产阶级，经常到深夜，毫无怨言，这些都是我们应该学习的地方。”
    通过举办学习班，工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志大大提高了政治觉悟和政策水平，他们决心更好地用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，同革命小将和革命知识分子一起，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，把教育革命进行到底！
