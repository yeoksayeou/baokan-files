	According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tirana, in recent years, the irrigation industry in Albanian villages has developed rapidly. The irrigated area has reached about half of the total sowing area, significantly promoting the development of agricultural production.

	According to the report, currently, Albania has several large-scale irrigation projects, including the Murrizani Reservoir with an irrigation capacity of over 25,000 hectares, the Vjosë-Lushnjë-Fier Canal with an irrigation capacity of 15,000 hectares, the Egmetalai Reservoir, the Peta Reservoir, the Tapiza Reservoir, and the Çerez Irrigation Canal. These large-scale irrigation projects were mainly built by the state and cooperative farmers after liberation.

	Currently, the irrigation projects in the low-lying areas of Albania are nearly completed. The state is investing a large amount of funds and labor into the construction of reservoirs in hilly and mountainous areas. In addition to the new irrigation projects that will be utilized this year, the irrigated area will be expanded by another 13,000 hectares.

	During the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970) of Albania, the irrigation projects under construction and those to be built will irrigate an additional 78,000 hectares of land.

    阿尔巴尼亚农村灌溉事业迅速发展
    灌溉面积已达到整个播种面积一半左右
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，近年来，阿尔巴尼亚农村的灌溉事业迅速发展，灌溉面积达到了整个播种面积的一半左右，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    据报道，目前，阿尔巴尼亚各种大型的灌溉工程有：灌溉能力达二万五千公顷以上的穆里齐水库，灌溉能力达一万五千公顷的维窝萨—勒万—菲埃渠道，埃格梅塔拉伊水库，彼塔水库，塔皮扎水库，切列兹灌溉渠道等。这些大型灌溉工程主要是在解放后由国家投资和由合作化的农民兴建起来的。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚低洼地区的灌溉工程已接近完成。国家正把大量的投资和劳动力投入到丘陵和高山地区水库的修建中。加上今年将利用的新的灌溉工程，灌溉面积还将扩大一万三千公顷。
    在阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年（一九六六——一九七○年）计划期间，正在施工的和将要兴建的灌溉工程，还将使七万八千公顷土地得到灌溉。
