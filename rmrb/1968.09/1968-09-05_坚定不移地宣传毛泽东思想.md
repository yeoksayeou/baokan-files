The great tide of the Cultural Revolution, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, is surging forward along the victorious course charted by the Chairman. The publication of the important article "Carry the Revolutionary Struggle on the News Front to the End" in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily marks the beginning of a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation on the news front.

Like all other fronts, the news front has been a scene of intense class struggle for many years.

Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and dogmatism. Therefore, all reactionary classes attempting to stage a comeback in socialist China must inevitably direct their attacks against our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev and his running dogs in the news circles, such as Wu Lianxi and his gang, harbor extreme hatred for Mao Zedong Thought and fear its widespread propagation in China and the world. The Chinese Khrushchev once howled with extreme hatred and fear, "The newspapers promote Mao Zedong Thought too much, too much, and that has its dangers." The master calls, and the servants respond. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the news circles immediately went mad, shouting, "Workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works cannot have immediate effects." This is extremely reactionary and vicious!

The workers, peasants, and soldiers have the deepest proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. They find Chairman Mao's words extremely warm and heartfelt, study them with great seriousness, and apply them with great vigor. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions that we understand, and we must also resolutely carry out those that we do not yet understand, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. Therefore, the workers, peasants, and soldiers learn Mao Zedong Thought most effectively.

Last September, Chairman Mao issued an important directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The workers, peasants, and soldiers acted swiftly and decisively, achieving great unity in revolution, and then achieving the three-in-one combination. Is this not an immediate effect?

The heroic peasants of Dazhai, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, displayed the great revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like the legendary Yu Gong, transforming their thoughts and their land. They set a brilliant example for China's agricultural front. Is this not an immediate effect?

The good soldier of Chairman Mao, Cai Yongxiang, enlisted only eight months ago. Through diligent study and application of Chairman Mao's works, he established a proletarian worldview. When the revolution needed him, he hesitated not for a moment and sacrificed his precious life. Is this not an immediate effect?

"The ship of revolution sails with the helmsman at the rudder, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Our proletarian newspapers must firmly and extensively promote Mao Zedong Thought. Our proletarian news warriors must fight and dedicate themselves to promoting and defending Mao Zedong Thought.

    坚定不移地宣传毛泽东思想
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的历史洪流，正沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的胜利航向滚滚向前。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》重要文章《把新闻战线的大革命进行到底》的发表，标志着新闻战线斗、批、改高潮的到来。
    新闻战线同各条战线一样，多少年以来，一直存在着惊心动魄的阶级斗争。
    毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义、修正主义和教条主义的强大思想武器。因此，一切反动阶级要想在社会主义的中国搞复辟活动，势必要把矛头对准我们的伟大领袖毛主席、对准战无不胜的毛泽东思想。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新闻界的走资派吴冷西及其一伙，极端仇视毛泽东思想，害怕毛泽东思想在全中国、全世界广泛传播。中国赫鲁晓夫就曾以无比仇恨、无限恐惧的心情狂吠什么报纸宣传毛泽东思想“太多了”，“太多了，就有一定的危险性”。主子一呼，奴才百应。中国赫鲁晓夫在新闻界的代理人，立即丧心病狂地叫嚷：“工农兵学习毛主席著作是不能立竿见影的”。真是反动透顶，恶毒之极！
    工农兵群众对毛主席有最深厚的无产阶级感情，对毛主席的话听起来无比亲切，学起来格外认真，用起来特别带劲。对毛主席的指示，我们理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。因此，广大工农兵群众学习毛泽东思想最能立竿见影。
    去年九月，毛主席发出了重要指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”广大工农兵群众闻风而动，雷厉风行，迅速实现了革命的大联合，进而实现了革命的三结合。难道这不是立竿见影吗？
    英雄的大寨的贫下中农，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，发扬愚公移山的大无畏革命精神，人换思想地换装，为我国农业战线树立了光辉榜样。难道这不是立竿见影吗？
    毛主席的好战士蔡永祥入伍仅仅八个月，由于努力活学活用毛主席著作，确立了无产阶级世界观，在革命需要他的时候，他毫不犹豫地献出了自己宝贵的生命。难道这不是立竿见影吗？
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们无产阶级的报纸就是要坚定不移地、深入广泛地宣传毛泽东思想。我们无产阶级的新闻战士就是要为宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想而战斗，为宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想而献身。
