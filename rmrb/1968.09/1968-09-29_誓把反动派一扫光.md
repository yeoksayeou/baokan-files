	"Carry the revolution through to the end!" Under the great commander Chairman Mao's order, the People's Liberation Army, carrying forward the spirit of continuous combat, won several major victories in the Northeast, liberated Mudanjiang, and then swiftly captured Niuzhuang Mountain and attacked Weihushan. They eliminated bandits, secured the rear, and thwarted the attacks by the U.S. and the KMT. Xiao Jianbo and Yang Zirong firmly and loudly declared: "We swear to sweep away all reactionaries!"

	Currently, in our work of cleaning up the remnants of the KMT reactionaries and purging the class ranks, we must also carry forward the spirit of "swearing to sweep away all reactionaries" and thoroughly eliminate all open and hidden class enemies.

	Xiao Jianbo and Yang Zirong, in order to sweep away the reactionaries, went deep into the homes of poor peasants, solved the difficulties of the masses, fully mobilized and relied on the masses, conducted thorough investigations and research, analyzed and understood the enemy situation, and fought a people's war. In our efforts to sweep away the reactionary garbage, we should also fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, widely expose, discuss, and lay out the enemy situation, conduct thorough investigations and research, and accurately and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies, making the class enemies drown in the vast ocean of the people's war. Let us take Xiao Jianbo and Yang Zirong as our examples, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution of the proletariat, and "swear to sweep away all reactionaries!"

    誓把反动派一扫光
    工人　冯军
    “将革命进行到底”！在伟大统帅毛主席的号令下，人民解放军发扬连续作战的精神，在东北打了几个大胜仗，解放了牡丹江之后，又一气拿下奶头山，进击威虎山，消灭土匪，巩固后方，粉碎美蒋进攻。少剑波、杨子荣坚定响亮地说：“誓把反动派一扫光”！
    当前，我们在扫除国民党反动派残渣余孽的清理阶级队伍工作中，同样要发扬“誓把反动派一扫光”的彻底革命精神，把各种公开的和暗藏的阶级敌人统统挖出来。
    少剑波、杨子荣为了把反动派一扫光，深入贫农家里，解决群众困难，充分发动和依靠群众，深入调查研究，分析和摸清敌情，打一场人民战争。我们在扫除反动派垃圾时，也应该充分发动群众，依靠群众，大揭大议大摆敌情，搞好调查研究，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，使阶级敌人陷于人民战争的汪洋大海之中。让我们以少剑波、杨子荣为榜样，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命的精神，“誓把反动派一扫光”！
