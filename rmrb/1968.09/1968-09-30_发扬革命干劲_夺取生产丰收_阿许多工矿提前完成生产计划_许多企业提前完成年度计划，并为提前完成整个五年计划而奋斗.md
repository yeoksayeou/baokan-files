Many factories and mines have completed their production plans ahead of schedule. Many enterprises have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule and are striving to complete the entire five-year plan ahead of schedule.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 28th, the characteristic of the third year of Albania's fourth five-year plan is that all production units are striving to overfulfill the plan targets. Many enterprises have completed this year's first nine months' plan ahead of schedule, and some enterprises have already completed the annual plan.

The workers of the Batër-Martanesh chromite mine in the Mat district have, by September 24, overfulfilled the first nine months' plan by 2,200 tons of chromite ore. The workers of this mine have also guaranteed to produce an additional 4,000 tons of chromite ore to overfulfill the annual plan.

The production units in the Krujë district have achieved results in increasing production. By the 21st of this month, the workers of the Laç Superphosphate Fertilizer Factory had overfulfilled the first nine months' plan, producing more than 7,000 tons of superphosphate and 8,800 tons of sulfuric acid.

In the Shkodër district, the workers of the leather shoe factory also completed the first nine months' plan one week ahead of schedule. There are even more advanced units among the production units. For example, the workers of the Tirana Meat Processing Plant have recently completed the annual plan. The workers are now striving to complete the entire five-year plan 13 months ahead of schedule.

According to our report, the Albanian working class is carrying forward the revolutionary initiative and creative spirit, achieving one victory after another on the production front. In the petroleum industry, statistics show that the original oil production plan for the first eight months of this year was completed at 104% of the target, with an increase of more than 100,000 tons of oil produced compared to the same period last year.

The workers in the light industry sector have also achieved outstanding production results. The cotton fabric production plan for the first eight months was completed at 106% of the target, and the wool fabric production plan was completed at 103%. The production tasks for electricity, cement, and asphalt for the first eight months of this year have also been overfulfilled.
