Workers at the Zhanggezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine, faced with a sudden rise in carbon monoxide and signs of spontaneous combustion, did not follow the old procedures of sealing the workface and halting production. Instead, they relied on Mao Zedong Thought to blaze a new trail.

On August 27, workers at the Zhanggezhuang Mine, both above and below ground, were fighting with revolutionary fervor to achieve excellent results for National Day. At this crucial moment, the 8137 coal mining workface suddenly detected a rise in carbon monoxide, a precursor to spontaneous combustion.

The workers discovered this situation and were extremely anxious. According to the old safety regulations, the workface had to be sealed immediately. This would not only result in a daily loss of 500 to 600 tons of coal production but also leave machinery and electrical equipment worth over 200,000 yuan sealed inside.

Should they follow the old safety regulations and withdraw from the workface, or should they take active measures to solve the carbon monoxide problem? After two years of tempering during the Cultural Revolution, the coal miners, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, decided to break through the old frameworks and foreign dogmas. After thorough investigation and scientific analysis, they concluded that the old safety regulations were unreasonable, passive, and a reflection of pure defensive military thinking in coal production. They discarded their superstitions about foreign dogmas and resolved to launch an offensive, eliminating carbon monoxide before spontaneous combustion could occur. They were determined to preserve the workface and produce more coal for the country.

At this juncture, some people who worshipped foreign things and only knew how to follow in others' footsteps blew a chill wind, saying, "We've never heard of such a thing in so many years. If we proceed, we might cause trouble!"

The revolutionary committee discovered this situation and first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully utilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." Mao's teachings greatly boosted the workers' confidence in overcoming difficulties. They said, "We do not rely on heaven, earth, or reactionary technical 'authorities.' We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to forge a new path!"

Eight days of intense battle passed. Measures such as increasing the fan power, modifying the air walls, and balancing ventilation were all implemented, but the situation did not improve. People's hearts grew more anxious. The revolutionary committee and the military propaganda team, at this critical moment, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an unstoppable spirit. It must overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them."

Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, many workers, technicians, and cadres from various units continued to seek solutions, displaying a spirit of continuous combat.

The veteran workers in the ventilation area, along with the technician Li Yong'an, who had just been promoted from the workers, proposed changing the wind direction based on their long-term practical experience in coal mining.

This method was something that bourgeois "authorities" would not even dare to consider. The revolutionary committee and the military propaganda team strongly supported the workers' initiative, encouraging them to tread a path that no one had walked before, and decided to change the wind direction. The ventilation area, the 4th mining area, the rescue team, and other relevant departments all adopted a series of preventive measures with a "seize the day" revolutionary spirit. Mao Zedong Thought guided this battle. The 4th mining area tunneling team was tasked with digging an 84-meter new air duct. In the past, completing this task would have taken 15 days, but this time, they finished it in just three days. Through the arduous efforts of revolutionary workers, the wind direction was changed, and a large amount of harmful gas was forced into the old, already mined areas and unimportant places. They then adopted local sealing measures and finally eliminated the carbon monoxide gas.

On September 10, the 8137 coal mining workface resumed normal production. The rumbling of machinery sang the praises of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought at Kailuan Coal Mine.

    开滦煤矿赵各庄矿一采煤工作面的工人群众，在一氧化碳突然上升，出现自然发火预兆的紧急关头，不是按照旧框框，封闭工作面，停止生产，而是靠——
    毛泽东思想指引创新路
    八月二十七日，开滦煤矿赵各庄矿井上井下的广大工人群众，正以冲天的革命干劲，奋战在抓革命促生产的第一线，准备以最优异的成绩向国庆节献礼。在这个紧要的时刻，八一三七采煤工作面，突然发现一氧化碳气体上升。这是井下采煤工作面自然发火的预兆。
    工人们发现了这一情况，个个心情十分焦急。按照旧的一套保安技术规定，必须马上封闭工作面。这样，不仅每天要少生产五、六百吨煤炭，而且还要把价值二十余万元的机电设备封在里边。
    是按照旧的一套保安规程，撤出工作面呢，还是采取积极措施，解决一氧化碳问题？经过两年多来文化大革命锻炼的煤矿工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，决心冲破那些洋教条和旧框框。他们通过认真的调查研究和进行了科学的分析以后，认为过去的保安规程是不合理的，是消极防御的办法，是单纯防御的军事思想在煤矿生产上的反映。他们破除对洋教条的迷信，下决心打进攻战，把一氧化碳消灭在自然发火之前。一定要千方百计保全工作面，为国家多生产煤炭。
    就在这个时候，一些崇洋迷外、只会踏着别人脚印走路的人，吹来了一阵冷风。他们说：
  “这么多年，没听说有这个名堂，搞不好，还会出乱子！”矿革委会发现这种情况，首先组织大家学习毛主席的“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示，以及有关认识客观世界和改造客观世界的论述。毛主席的教导，大大增强了工人们战胜困难的信心。他们说：“我们不靠天，不靠地，不靠反动技术‘权威’。我们要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，坚决闯出一条新路来！”
    八天的紧张战斗过去了。加大风车、改风墙、均衡通风等措施都用上了，但情况仍不见好转。人们的心越来越焦急。矿革委会和驻军毛泽东思想宣传队，在大家焦急的时刻，又组织大家学习毛主席关于
  “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导。在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，许多单位的工人、技术员和干部，都发扬连续战斗的精神，继续寻找解决问题的途径。
    通风区的老工人们，和刚从工人中提拔的技术员李永安一起，根据长期在煤矿上工作的实践经验，提出了改变风向的建议。
    这个办法，是资产阶级“权威”连想都不敢想的。矿革委会和驻军毛泽东思想宣传队大力支持工人们的创举，鼓励他们走前人没有走过的路，并决定改变风向。通风区、采四区、救护队等有关部门，都以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，采取了一系列的预防措施。毛泽东思想指挥着这场战斗。采四区掘进队担任打通一条八十四米新风道的任务。要是在过去，完成这个任务，得用十五天时间，但他们这次仅仅用了三天。经过广大革命职工的艰苦奋战，风向改好了，大量的有害气体被压入已采空的老塘和无关紧要的地方。他们又采取局部封闭的办法，终于把一氧化碳气体消灭了。
    九月十日，八一三七采煤工作面，又恢复了正常生产。隆隆的机器声，歌唱着伟大的毛泽东思想在开滦煤矿的新胜利。　开滦煤矿报道组
