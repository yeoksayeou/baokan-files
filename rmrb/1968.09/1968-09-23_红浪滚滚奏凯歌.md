	The cultural revolution's storm and thunder,
	Banners fluttering, drums urging the battle,
	Red waves roll, playing the victory song,
	In the land of hibiscus, all is dawn light.

	Looking from Jiangnan to the northern frontier,
	The mountains and rivers are red, intoxicating!
	Looking at today and remembering the past,
	Mao Zedong Thought shows its might!

	How many times have the waves been terrifying,
	How many storms have raged,
	How many gusts of foul wind have blown,
	Dare to confront, the red sun shines, horses urge on!

	The great commander waves his hand,
	A million heroes blow their horns:
	Disperse the clouds, welcome the rising sun,
	Ten thousand mountains and rivers shine brightly.

	Laughing at the red rain, spring flowers green,
	Hearing the victory songs ring clear,
	The ten thousand li of mountains and rivers are new,
	A generation of heroes smile.

	The green mountains are towering and majestic,
	The green waters flow gently and charming,
	Chairman Mao wields the brush, painting a grand blueprint,
	The rivers and mountains are magnificent and beautiful!

	Seeing the beautiful scenery, tears well up,
	The passion is like the Yangtze River,
	The world of October is now red like fire,
	Raising arms, shouting, "Long live the great leader!"

    红浪滚滚奏凯歌
    福州红旗茶场工人　夏雄
    文化革命卷风雷，
    旌旗猎猎战鼓催，
    红浪滚滚奏凯歌，
    芙蓉国里尽朝晖。
    放眼江南望塞北，
    山水红透啊令人醉！
    喜看今朝忆往昔，
    毛泽东思想显神威！
    多少次惊涛骇浪，
    多少阵恶雨狂飞，
    多少股腥风扑面，
    敢交锋，红日放光战马催！
    伟大统帅巨手一挥，
    百万雄兵军号劲吹：
    驱散云雾迎旭日，
    千山万水放光辉。
    笑看红雨潇潇春花翠，
    喜听祝捷歌儿声声脆，
    万里山河满眼新啊，
    一代群英笑微微。
    青山重重啊多雄伟，
    绿水悠悠啊更妩媚，
    毛主席挥舞彩笔画宏图，
    江山壮丽无限美！
    望佳景啊涌热泪，
    激情恰似长江水，
    十月的天地而今红似火，
    举臂高呼“伟大领袖万万岁！”
