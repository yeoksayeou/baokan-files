Vice Chairman Lin has instructed us: "Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship, a socialist state with 700 million people. We need a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this ideology, we can maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit and a firm and correct political direction." The country needs a unified ideology to be a revolutionary state; the family also needs a unified ideology to be a revolutionary family.

My father is a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the production team, production brigade, and commune, and is a rebel. He dares to rebel against others; but he does not dare to rebel against the old patriarchal authority in himself. In the family, he always makes the final decision, and rarely listens to others' opinions, but everyone has to listen to his. In my struggle against my father's old ideology and habits, I also had selfish thoughts, fearing that if we argued, father and daughter would not get along, and others would gossip. My father, on the other hand, still uses these old ideas as his foundation, often saying things like, "A family of a thousand mouths, one person in charge, as it has always been."

This year in March, I attended the conference of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside, held by the provincial military region. Zhang Xiang from Baoli Commune in Changtu County introduced the inspiring story of a new bride in their brigade who rebelled against her father-in-law's old ideas. This inspired me greatly. I thought, not daring to rebel against my father's old ideas is protecting the "four olds." But how should I rebel? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our task is to cross the river, but without a bridge or a boat, we cannot cross. If we do not solve the problem of the bridge or boat, crossing the river is just empty talk." I decided to use Zhang Xiang's story as the "boat" to complete the task of "crossing the river."

I returned to the brigade and conveyed the spirit of the conference to all the commune members, and also told the inspiring story of the new bride rebelling against her father-in-law's old ideas. My father also attended this meeting. After the meeting, I asked my father, "What did you learn from this?" My father said, "The new bride rebelling against her father-in-law is good." I heard that my father had gotten on the "boat," so I took the opportunity to say to him, "Tonight, will you organize the whole family to study and learn?" My father, hearing that he had to organize the family to study, seemed a bit nervous and tried to avoid it by saying, "You organize it, I still have a bit..." and stopped mid-sentence. I immediately took over and said, "You still can't let go of your pride, afraid of losing your 'authority,' right? You are the leader, you have to lead by example!" My father had no reason to refuse, so he agreed.

In the evening, after the production team meeting had just dispersed, I hurried home, wanting to hear how my father was struggling against himself. Walking to the window, I heard my father say: "The new bride in Hongyan Brigade of Changtu County is truly revolutionary, daring to rebel against her father-in-law, that is true democracy! But in our family, I heard that there are still people who fear me, fear me for what, just speak up, from now on I will put down my father's pride, break the old rule of 'a family of a thousand mouths, one person in charge.' Now it is a new society! Everyone should manage the family, I will hand over my power." I couldn't hold back my laughter and rushed into the room saying, "Father said well, the new society needs a new family ethos, we need to establish a Mao Zedong Thought family ethos. Father is the family study group leader, not handing over power, but holding the power of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, doing things and thinking, regardless of gender, age, whoever's words conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will follow." My brother said, "We should not only care for the elderly in life, but also in politics. Everyone in the family should care for each other politically, love and help each other, and establish new revolutionary family relationships." My father happily said, "Good, I will definitely hold the power of Mao Zedong Thought. Now I will mobilize the masses, whoever has opinions should speak up, if wrong, correct it, and I will not retaliate." Usually, my mother and father often quarrel over some household matters, but they always lose to my father, and my mother, holding back some anger, eagerly said, "Good, I will give you some advice: do you remember? Last year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, you wanted to drink alcohol, and I bought you half a jin of alcohol. You thought it was too little, threw your chopsticks, and smashed the alcohol pot, making the whole family not eat well. In fact, half a jin of alcohol is enough for you to drink for several meals, you just thought that others would know you only bought half a jin of alcohol for the festival, it was too stingy, and you lost face, purely bourgeois ideology. To be honest, this half a jin of alcohol is still thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership! In the old society, during the festival, not to mention drinking alcohol, sometimes there was not even rice soup to drink. I think you have forgotten your roots!" My mother's words touched my father's sore spot, and he blushed, but soon calmed down and read aloud from Chairman Mao's quotations: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, anyone can point them out to us." After reading, my father humbly said, "Who else has opinions, speak up." My sister-in-law, who never says a "no" to my father, also mustered her courage and timidly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to look at problems dialectically. But sometimes father looks at a person as if they are set in stone. People are not perfect, as long as they are our own people, we should help them warmly, and should not look at them as hopeless and unchangeable." Although my sister-in-law did not name anyone, everyone knew she was referring to a few class brothers in the village who were relatively backward in their thinking. Then, my third sister stood up and said passionately, "I have an opinion for father. Last year, just after the spring, the new passenger car factory moved away, leaving some bricks. Father saw others going to pick them up, and also called us to pick them up. We said at the time that these are state properties, not even half a brick should be moved. But father did not listen at all and said, 'What state property, it is thrown away and not needed, others can pick it up, why can't we?' Father, think about it, what kind of ideology and behavior is this!"

This family study meeting was truly successful. Everyone spoke freely, and father listened humbly. Almost all the opinions father accepted. From then on, our family changed, establishing a revolutionary new family ethos.

In April this year, during the busy season of drought relief and planting, father saw that the windows at home were small and not well-ventilated, and wanted to enlarge them and install glass, estimating it would take four or five workdays. In the past, he would have had the "patriarchal authority" and everyone would have to listen to him. But this time it was different. My brother said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to 'grasp revolution, promote production.' We are busy with our own affairs, which is not conducive to collective production." Father immediately accepted the opinion and canceled the plan to repair the windows, leading the whole family to actively participate in the brigade's drought relief and planting activities.

    社会主义的新家风
    辽宁省凌源县凌源公社八间房大队民兵营政治指导员  张淑芬
    林副主席指示我们：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”国家需要有一个统一的思想，才象一个革命化的国家；家庭也需要有一个统一的思想，才象一个革命化的家庭。
    我爸爸是生产队、生产大队和公社的贫协代表，是个造反派。他敢于造别人的反；可他不肯造自己身上的旧家长权威的反。家里的事，总是他一个人说了算，别人的意见他常常不听，可他的意见别人非听不行。在和爸爸这种旧思想作风的斗争中，我也有私心，怕闹翻了，父女不和，外人会说三道四。爸爸呢，还拿这些当老本，常说什么“家有千口，主事一人，古来如此。”
    今年三月，我出席了省军区召开的农村活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会。昌图县宝力公社红缨大队的张祥同志在大会上介绍了他们大队一个新媳妇造老公公旧思想的反的动人事迹，对我启发很大。我想，不敢造爸爸旧思想的反，就是保护“四旧”。我又想怎个造法呢？毛主席教导我们说：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。”我决定用张祥这个材料当“船”，来完成“过河”的任务。
    我回到大队就向全体社员传达了大会的精神，同时讲了张祥同志介绍的新媳妇造老公公旧思想反的动人的事。爸爸也参加了这次大会。会后，我问爸爸说：“你听了以后，受点啥教育？”爸爸说：“新媳妇造老公公的反，造得好。”我一听爸爸上了“船”，就趁热打铁地对他说：“你今天晚上组织全家学习学习，好不好？”爸爸一听要组织全家学习，好象有点紧张似的，推托道：“还是你组织吧，我还有点……”说半截就停下了。我立刻接过来说：“还有点放不下架子，怕丢了‘权威’，是不是？你是组长，要引火烧身嘛！”爸爸觉得没有理由推辞，就答应了。
    晚上，生产队的会刚散，我就急忙往家跑，想听听爸爸是怎样斗私的。走到窗户下，就听爸爸说：“昌图红缨大队那个新媳妇才算是革命的呢，敢造老公公的反，那真是大民主哩！可是咱家，我听说，还有人怕我，怕我干啥，有意见就提嘛，从今以后我要放下老子的架子，打破家有千口，主事一人的老规。如今是新社会嘛！大家都要管家，我要交权了。”我有点憋不住，一边笑，一边闯进屋里说：“爸爸说得好，新社会要有新家风，我们要建立毛泽东思想的家风。爸爸是家庭学习小组长，不是要交权，而是要掌好毛泽东思想的权。今后做事情，想问题，不论男女，不分老少，谁说的符合毛泽东思想就服从谁。”哥哥说：“我们对老人，不但要从生活上关心，更要从政治上关心。全家人都要从政治上互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，建立革命家庭的新关系。”爸爸高兴地说：“好，我一定掌好毛泽东思想的权。我现在放手发动群众，谁有意见大胆提，错了就改，决不打击报复。”平时妈妈和爸爸常常为一些家务事闹口角，但总是闹不过爸爸，憋了些气，便争着说：“那好，我给你提：你记得不？去年八月节，你要喝酒，我给你打了半斤酒，你嫌少，摔筷子，掼酒壶，闹得全家没吃好饭。其实半斤酒够你喝几顿的，你就是觉得，别人要知道你过节才打半斤酒，太小气，面子上不好看，纯粹是资产阶级思想。老实说，这半斤酒还是亏了毛主席他老人家领导的呢！在旧社会，过节甭说喝酒，有时连米汤也没得灌，我看你是忘本了！”妈妈的这些话触到了爸爸的痛处，他不好意思地红了脸，但马上又镇静起来，向大家念起了毛主席语录：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”念完，爸爸虚心地说：“谁还有，大胆提。”嫂子在爸爸面前是从来不说半个“不”字的，这时也鼓起勇气怯生生地说：“毛主席教导我们，看问题要一分为二。可是爸爸有时就把一个人看死了，人那有十全十美的，只要是自己人，就应该热情的帮助，不应该把人家看成死落后，不会转变了。”嫂嫂虽然没有指名，可是大家都知道她指的是村里那几个思想比较落后的阶级兄弟。接着，三妹子喊了声“报告”，站了起来慷慨地说：“我给爸爸提个意见，去年刚开春，新生客车厂搬走了，扔下点砖头，爸爸见别人家去拣，也叫我们去拣。我们当时就说，那是国家的财产，半个砖头也不该动。可爸爸根本不听，还说：‘什么国家财产，扔在那儿不要的了，别人能拣，我们为什么不能拣。’爸爸，你想想这是一种什么思想和行为！”
    这次家庭学习会开得真好，大家尽情地提，爸爸虚心地听，几乎所有的意见爸爸都接受了。从此，我们这个家就变了样，树立了革命的新家风。
    今年四月，正在抗旱种地大忙时节，爸爸看家里窗户口小，通风不畅，想改大些，再安上玻璃，估计要四、五个劳动日。要是过去，他有“家长权威”，就得听他的。可是，这次却不同了，哥哥说：毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，咱们却忙自家的事，这不利于集体生产。爸爸马上接受意见，取消了修理窗户的计划，带领全家积极参加队里的抗旱播种活动。
