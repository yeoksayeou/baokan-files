Paris students, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, are not deceived by the French ruling clique and are not afraid of the brutal suppression by the police. In recent days, they have launched a new wave of mass struggles. More than a thousand Paris students demonstrated on the 10th to protest against the government's suppression of the student movement and the persecution of active participants in the May-June revolutionary movement. The Paris students' struggle against the decaying bourgeois education system by boycotting exams is also advancing.

On the morning of the 10th, students at the Paris Law School defied the authorities' ban and decided to hold a mass meeting in the school that evening to discuss issues related to French television and radio propaganda and to support more than a hundred television and radio reporters who were unjustly dismissed by the government for opposing government control of the television and radio stations and engaging in distorted propaganda during May and June this year. Upon hearing the news, the French government dispatched a large number of police to seal off the area in the afternoon of the 10th, forcibly closed the school, and detained 150 students inside. This action by the French government sparked the indignation of Paris students. That evening, more than a thousand students, despite police obstruction and threats, gathered near the Law School to support the students' struggle and express their anger and protest to the French government. Under the pressure of the masses, the police authorities eventually had to agree to unconditionally release the 150 students detained in the school. Upon their release, they immediately joined the ranks of the demonstrators. The indignant students delivered speeches at the meeting, expressing their determination to continue the struggle against the decaying capitalist social and educational systems. Meanwhile, the struggle initiated by Paris medical students to demand reforms to the decaying educational system and to boycott unreasonable examination systems is also advancing despite all difficulties.

More than five thousand Paris students held a demonstration and march in the university district on the 5th and then held a protest meeting at the Paris Medical School. On the 6th, several thousand Paris medical students voted to boycott the final exams that were postponed due to the revolutionary storm of May and June. They advocated for an immediate reform of the decaying educational system and put forward demands such as guaranteeing students' freedom to engage in political activities on campus, reforming teaching content, methods, and examination systems.

The French ruling clique is very afraid that the Paris students' boycott of exams will spread like wildfire, so they are trying their best to suppress this struggle. On the evening of the 8th, the French government dispatched a large number of police to forcibly close the headquarters of the Paris Medical Students' Action Committee, which initiated this boycott of exams. Subsequently, on the 9th and 10th, a large number of plainclothes police were sent into the examination venues to disrupt the boycott. The French government and school authorities also issued statements, threatening the boycotting students with retention and expulsion.

However, the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance. Paris students were not intimidated. They bravely faced the fully armed police, shouting, "We will continue the struggle!" In recent days, students opposing the current French educational system have formed propaganda teams of one to two hundred people, calling on students to boycott exams in and around the examination venues. They shouted anti-fascist slogans in the face of the large number of plainclothes police gathered at the examination venues. The Medical Students' Committee also issued a statement on the 10th, exposing that the French government had dispatched a large number of "plainclothes police to occupy the medical school and its surroundings," and emphasized that students resolutely oppose the dispatch of police into schools. In recent days, several students have been injured by plainclothes police under the orders of the French authorities, sparking public outrage among the students. Students have been shouting slogans in the examination venues to express their protest. The examinations at the Medical School have been unable to continue and were stopped in the afternoon of the 10th.

Students in various provinces of France have also risen up in response to the Paris students' struggle. In Grenoble, students at the Economics Institute decided to boycott exams on the 10th. Medical students in Toulouse had already decided to boycott exams on the 7th. The French students' struggle against the decaying capitalist educational system is in full swing and continues to advance.

    抗议政府镇压学生运动　反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度
    法国学生斗争浪潮滚滚向前
    巴黎学生组成一、二百人的宣传队在各考场内外号召学生抵制考试
    新华社十一日讯　巴黎消息：有着光荣革命传统的巴黎学生，不受法国统治集团的欺骗，不怕警察残暴的镇压，连日来掀起了新的群众斗争的浪潮。巴黎学生一千多人，十日奋起示威，抗议政府镇压学生运动和迫害五、六月革命运动的积极参加者。巴黎学生反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的罢考斗争也正在向前发展。
    十日清晨，巴黎法学院的学生不顾当局的禁令，决定当天晚上在学院内举行群众大会，讨论法国的电视广播宣传问题，声援由于今年五、六月间反对政府控制电视广播台进行歪曲宣传而被政府无理解雇的一百多名电视广播记者。法国政府闻讯后，在十日下午派出大批警察封锁了这个地区，强行封闭了这个学院，并且把一百五十名学生关在学院里。法国政府这一行动激起巴黎学生的义愤。当天晚上，一千多名学生不顾警察的阻拦和威胁，集中到法学院附近，支持法学院学生的斗争。向法国政府表示愤怒的抗议。在群众的压力下，警察当局最后不得不同意无条件释放被关在学院里的一百五十名学生。他们出来后马上参加了示威群众的行列。义愤填膺的学生们在会上纷纷发表演说，表示决心把反对腐朽的资本主义社会制度和教育制度的斗争坚持下去。与此同时，巴黎医科学生带头掀起的要求改革腐朽的教育制度，抵制不合理的考试制度的罢考斗争，也正在排除万难，向前发展。
    巴黎学生五千多人，五日在大学区举行示威游行后，在巴黎医学院举行抗议大会。六日，数千名巴黎医科学生投票决定抵制由于五、六月革命风暴而推迟下来的期终考试。他们主张马上改革腐朽的教育制度，并提出保证学生在校内进行政治活动的自由，改革教学的内容、方法和考试制度等要求。
    法国统治集团很害怕巴黎学生的罢考斗争会蔓延成为燎原的大火，因此极力想扼杀这场斗争。八日晚，法国政府派出大批警察强行封闭了首先发动这次罢考斗争的巴黎医科学生行动委员会的总部。接着在九日和十日派出大批便衣警察进入各考场，破坏罢考斗争。法国政府和学校当局还纷纷发表谈话，以留级和开除威胁罢考的学生。
    可是，压迫越大，反抗越强。巴黎学生并没有被吓倒。他们横眉勇对全副武装的警察，斗志昂扬地高呼：“我们要继续斗争下去”。连日来，反对法国现行教育制度的学生组成了一、二百人的宣传队，在各考场内外号召学生抵制考试。他们面对麇集在考场的大批便衣警察高呼反对法西斯分子的口号。医科学生委员会十日也发表公报，揭露法国政府派遣了大批“便衣警察占领了医学院和该院周围的地方”，并强调指出，学生们坚决反对把警察派进学校。连日来，法国当局指使便衣警察打伤了好几个学生，激起了学生们的公愤，学生们纷纷在考场内高呼口号，表示抗议。医学院的考试无法进行下去，已在十日下午停止。
    法国各省的学生也纷纷起来，响应巴黎学生的斗争。在格勒诺布勒，经济学院的学生十日决定抵制考试。图卢兹的医科学生在七日已决定罢考。法国学生反对腐朽的资本主义教育制度的斗争方兴未艾，正在向前发展。
