Revolutionary farmers and herdsmen across the country have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm in revolution and production, leading to a thriving livestock industry nationwide.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and his latest series of instructions, the broad masses of revolutionary farmers and herdsmen in our country have channeled the unparalleled enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, resulting in a flourishing and prosperous livestock industry. Both the quantity and quality of various livestock have seen significant improvements and increases.

Last year, the number of horses, mules, cattle, donkeys, and other large livestock, as well as sheep and pigs, reached or exceeded historical highs. The increase in improved Merino sheep was particularly notable. In the past, provinces like Shandong, Henan, and Hebei, where the development of large livestock was slow and draft animals were scarce, have accelerated the development of large livestock through collective efforts in recent years, effectively solving the problem of insufficient draft animals. This year, our country's livestock industry is again experiencing a bumper harvest. Major pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, despite some regions suffering severe wind and snow disasters last winter and this spring, have seen an increase in the survival rate of young livestock and the conservation rate of adult livestock compared to last year's bumper harvest. The overall livestock production situation is better than last year. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, seven leagues and two cities, except for one league with an average year, all other leagues and cities are experiencing a bumper harvest. The number of livestock raised in these regions has increased by 3% to 7% compared to last year, with some communes and brigades increasing by over 10%. The physical condition of livestock has also improved, and the number of improved breeds has significantly increased compared to last year. The livestock industry in various agricultural regions is also flourishing. It is understood that provinces and municipalities such as Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have seen a significant increase in the number of horses, mules, cattle, donkeys, and other large livestock compared to last year.

The broad masses of revolutionary farmers, herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres across the country, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao, have actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and his latest series of instructions. They have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places. They have deeply exposed and criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents' heinous crimes of peddling "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and other revisionist goods, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. This has greatly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and their revolutionary enthusiasm continues to soar.

Revolutionary farmers and herdsmen across the country have fought bravely to develop the livestock industry. Last winter and this spring, some regions in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai experienced severe wind and snow disasters, with some regions lasting for three to four months, seriously affecting the normal grazing of livestock. However, the broad masses of revolutionary herdsmen in these regions, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the help of the revolutionary committees and the propaganda teams sent by the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support units, have highly carried forward Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory." They have fought against natural disasters with various methods to carefully raise and manage livestock, saving grain to feed sick and weak young livestock. Some even braved the cold to drive their flocks to areas with less snow for grazing. They have finally overcome the severe wind and snow disasters, protected the livestock, and laid a solid foundation for the development of the livestock industry this year.

    广大革命农民、牧民在抓革命促生产中焕发出冲天干劲
    全国畜牧业生产呈现一派繁荣兴旺景象
    据新华社十八日讯  我国广大革命农民、牧民群众在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针和一系列最新指示的指引下，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产中去，促使畜牧业生产呈现一派繁荣兴旺的大好形势，各种牲畜在数量和质量上都有较大的发展和提高。
    去年，全国马、骡、牛、驴等大牲畜和羊、猪的饲养量，已经达到或超过历史的最高水平，其中改良绵羊增长的幅度更大。过去，大牲畜发展较慢、耕畜比较缺乏的山东、河南、河北等省，这几年坚决依靠集体力量积极加快大牲畜的发展速度，已经有效地解决了耕畜不足的问题。今年，我国畜牧业生产又是一个丰收年景。主要牧区的内蒙古、新疆、青海等省、自治区，虽然部分地区在去冬今春遭受到严重的风、雪灾害，但仔畜的成活率和成畜的保育率，都比丰收的去年又有不同程度的提高；整个畜牧业的生产形势也比去年好。内蒙古自治区的七盟二市中，除一个盟是平年年景外，其余各盟、市都是丰收年景。这些地区今年饲养牲畜的头数，分别比去年增长百分之三到百分之七以上，有的社队增长百分之十以上。各地牲畜的体质也有增强，良种牲畜普遍比去年显著增长。各农业区的畜牧业生产也出现了蓬勃发展的大好形势。据了解，山东、河北、黑龙江、浙江、上海等省、市，马、骡、牛、驴等大牲畜的饲养量，都比去年有较大的增长。
    我国广大革命农民、牧民群众和革命干部，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针和一系列最新指示的指引下，积极地投入无产阶级文化大革命运动。他们遵照毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，展开了持久深入的革命大批判。他们以无比仇恨深刻地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人竭力贩卖“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，革命干劲越来越高。
    各地革命农民、牧民群众为了发展畜牧业生产，进行了英勇的斗争。去冬今春，内蒙古、新疆、青海等省、自治区的部分地区出现严重的风、雪灾害，有的地区持续三、四个月之久，严重地影响牲畜的正常放牧。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗锻炼的这些地区的广大革命牧民群众，在革命委员会和人民解放军支农部队派出的毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，高度发扬毛主席教导的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，奋起和自然灾害作斗争。他们想出各种办法精心饲养和管理牲畜，把粮食节约下来喂养病弱幼畜，有的还冒着严寒把羊群赶到降雪少的地方放牧，终于战胜了严重的风、雪灾害，保护了牲畜，为今年畜牧业的发展打下了良好基础。
