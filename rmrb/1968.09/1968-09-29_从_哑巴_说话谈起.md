From the "Mute" Speaking

In the play *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy* and *Asking for Suffering in the Deep Mountains*, there is a scene where Yang Zhirong talks to Chang Bao. Chang Bao hesitates to speak. At this moment, her father, Chang Shouye, quickly interrupts, pointing at little Chang Bao and saying, "She is mute."

Is Chang Bao really mute? No, she is not mute at all; she is a clever child. If Chang Bao is not mute, why can't she speak? Why does her father always say she is mute in front of others? Listen to Chang Bao's indignant accusation: "Eight years ago, on a snowy night, a great misfortune befell us! Seatiger killed my grandmother and abducted my parents. Uncle Jiaji in Jiaji Gorge adopted me, but my father escaped while my mother jumped into the gorge and died. Mother! To avoid the deep mountains, my father feared I would fall into the hands of the devil, so from then on, I pretended to be mute and dressed as a boy." This is an angry accusation against the dark old society! The evil Kuomintang bandits, burning, killing, and raping, caused families to be destroyed and people to be ruined; the cannibalistic old society made those who could speak dare not speak, and girls dressed as boys. All oppressed people under heaven have such a blood-stained account.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The Chinese people, who have suffered generation after generation, do not want to be slaves or "mute." They always "wait for the stars and the moon, just waiting for the sun to rise in the deep mountains, just waiting to speak in front of people, just waiting to return to being a girl. Just waiting—to settle the eight-year blood debt, wishing they could have wings, hold a rifle, fly to the hilltop, and kill all the wolves!"

They finally waited for this day. Chairman Mao's people's army came to the valley, stationed in Jiaji Gorge, and the brilliant light of the red sun illuminated the deep mountains and old forests. In such a beautiful time, Chang Bao, who had been "mute" for eight years, could no longer hold back her heart full of hatred and finally spoke in front of people. The "mute" is no longer mute.

Chang Bao went from being able to speak to pretending to be mute, and then from "mute" to speaking. This vividly tells us: the working people suffered in the old society, but after liberation, they stood up as masters. Let us think about the past in the name of revolution, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly hold the gun, and hold the pen tightly, so that the socialist red land will never change color.

    从“哑巴”说话谈起
    老工人　丁广明
    《智取威虎山》《深山问苦》一场里有这么一个场面：杨子荣对常宝说话，常宝欲语犹止。这时，他爹常猎户赶紧抢过话头，指着小常宝说：“他是哑巴”。
    常宝真是哑巴吗？不是，她一点不哑，而是一个聪明的孩子。常宝明明不是哑巴为什么不能说话呢？为什么她爹在人前总是说她哑巴呢？请听常宝悲愤的控诉吧：“八年前风雪夜大祸从天降！座山雕杀我祖母掳走爹娘。夹皮沟大山叔将我收养，爹逃回我娘却跳涧身亡。娘啊！避深山爹怕我陷入魔掌，从此我充哑人女扮男装。”这是对黑暗的旧社会的愤怒控诉！万恶的蒋匪帮，烧杀奸淫，使人家破人亡；吃人的旧社会，使能说话的不敢把话讲，女孩儿扮男装。普天下被压迫的人民都有一本这样的血泪账。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。压迫愈深，反抗愈强。世世代代受尽苦难的中国人民，是不愿意做奴隶、当“哑巴”的。他们时刻“盼星星盼月亮，只盼着深山出太阳，只盼着能在人前把话讲，只盼着早日还我女儿装。只盼——讨清八年血泪账，恨不能生翅膀、持猎枪、飞上山岗、杀尽豺狼！”
    他们终于盼来了这一天。毛主席的人民军队来到山坳里，进驻夹皮沟，红太阳的灿烂光辉照亮了深山老林。在这样美好的日子里，当了八年“哑巴”的小常宝再也憋不住满腔仇恨，终于在人前把话讲，“哑巴”从此不哑了。
    常宝从会说话到装哑巴，又从“哑巴”到说话，这非常生动地告诉我们：劳动人民在旧社会受苦受难，解放后就翻身作主人。让我们以革命的名义想想过去，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，握紧枪杆子，掌好笔杆子，让社会主义红色江山永不变色。
