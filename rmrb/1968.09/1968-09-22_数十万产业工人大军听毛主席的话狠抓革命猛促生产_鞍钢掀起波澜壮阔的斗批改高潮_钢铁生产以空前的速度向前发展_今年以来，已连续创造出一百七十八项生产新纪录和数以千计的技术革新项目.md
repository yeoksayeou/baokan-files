Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fully bringing into play the leading role of the working class, tens of millions of industrial workers in Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Steel) have been filled with high revolutionary enthusiasm, fiercely grasping the revolution and promoting production. They have launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and reform, driving the development of steel production to unprecedented heights. They have achieved one victory after another.

Since the beginning of this year, the revolutionary workers of all factories and mines in Anshan Steel, inspired by the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, have been full of revolutionary vigor. They have continuously created 178 new production records, many of which are historical records since the start of operations. On the basis of significantly improving the production and quality of major products such as steel ingots, pig iron, steel, and metallurgical coke, they have created thousands of technological innovation projects and rolled out many new varieties of steel needed for national construction. Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle," have greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel. They have fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and their enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production has been further boosted. In just half a month from August 15 to the end of the month, they created 148 new production records since the start of operations, equivalent to seven times the number of new records created in the first half of the year. Since September, the broad masses of steel workers have carried forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, pressing forward to victory, and have pushed steel production to a new level.

The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel, reviewing the two-year battle course of the Cultural Revolution, deeply felt that the working class can only fully bring into play its leading role by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The working class must lead everything, which means leading everything with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the working class must become a model in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Since the beginning of this year, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Anshan Steel has reached a new high. From the factory area to the workers' residential area, from the front of the steel furnace to the iron mine, everywhere is a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. So far, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various factories and mines have reached more than 5,000 sessions, with more than 400,000 participants. The broad revolutionary workers have unified their thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that every instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao and every order from the proletarian headquarters can be promptly implemented. Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, transfer office staff to the front line, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and reform generally go through these stages." The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel immediately took action and launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. They held high the great red banner of the "Anshan Constitution," and carried out great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their revisionist black goods such as "material incentives," "expert management," and "technology first." At the same time, they combined the great criticism with the cleanup of class ranks, and firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly struck at a handful of class enemies. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, various factories and mines mobilized revolutionary workers to conduct in-depth investigations and research, resolutely streamlined organizations, and reformed unreasonable regulations and systems. Many factories and mines changed from the original three-level management to two-level management. The revolutionary committee members went to the production front line to work in shifts, gradually establishing a revolutionary leadership team that is streamlined, has fewer personnel, and faces the masses. The original 19 functional departments and 2,500 people in the Anshan Steel headquarters were streamlined to only 4 offices and 300 people. After the streamlining of organizations, many office staff were transferred to the production front line, and the efficiency of office work also improved. Various factories and mines mobilized revolutionary workers to break many regulations and systems that hindered production, greatly liberating the productive forces.

Accompanying the wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is the wave of industrial production. The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel, at this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, deeply understand their heavy and glorious mission. They, on the one hand, selected outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and step by step, planned to enter schools and units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform; on the other hand, they put forward the battle slogan of "reducing personnel but increasing production" in the face of reduced personnel, ensuring continuous production growth. The revolutionary workers of various iron-making factories in Anshan Steel took the lead in this battle. The production of pig iron increased month by month in July and August, with quality improving month by month. The production level in September also increased. The tens of thousands of workers in three steel-making factories competed with each other, carrying out cooperative activities between workshops, furnaces, and shifts, and steel production was booming. The revolutionary workers of the large rolling mill completed the trial production and production of new-type heavy rails 40 days ahead of schedule. The new creations and records that emerged one after another in the smelting and rolling systems drove the production wave forward in the mining, mechanical, power, and transportation systems.

In the new wave of revolution and production, good news about technological revolution and innovation in various factories and mines of Anshan Steel kept coming in. The revolutionary workers of the No. 17 open-hearth furnace in the Second Steel Plant used a set of methods such as furnace repair to create a world record of 104 uses for the bottom of a large open-hearth furnace. The revolutionary workers of the seamless steel tube plant boldly innovated production equipment and technology, and successfully trial-produced 60 new products this year with international advanced levels, many of which are urgently needed for national construction. The revolutionary workers of the casting tube plant broke the old rule of "experts make the law, workers follow the law" and achieved dozens of technological innovations, among which the innovation of continuous tube casting automatic control has reached an international advanced level. These facts prove that Chairman Mao's pointing out that "the lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish" is an unshakable great truth.

Recently, Anshan Steel held an experience exchange and award conference on "grasp the revolution and promote production," commending 166 advanced units and 751 outstanding individuals who made outstanding contributions in grasping the revolution and promoting production. The broad revolutionary workers unanimously expressed that in this good situation, they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," and seize the opportunity to seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and reform, making greater contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    数十万产业工人大军听毛主席的话狠抓革命猛促生产
    鞍钢掀起波澜壮阔的斗批改高潮
    钢铁生产以空前的速度向前发展
    今年以来，已连续创造出一百七十八项生产新纪录和数以千计的技术革新项目
    据新华社鞍山二十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席关于充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的一系列最新指示的指引下，鞍钢数十万产业工人大军以高昂的革命热情，狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起波澜壮阔的斗、批、改新高潮，推动钢铁生产以空前未有的速度向前发展，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。
    今年以来，鞍钢各厂矿革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势的鼓舞下，革命干劲倍增，连续创造出一百七十八项生产新纪录，其中不少项目是开工以来的历史最新纪录。在钢锭、生铁、钢材和冶金焦等主要产品的产量和质量大幅度提高的基础上，创造出数以千计的技术革新项目，轧制出许多国家建设急需的钢材新品种。毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了鞍钢的广大革命职工。他们全面落实毛主席的这一最新指示，抓革命促生产的干劲更足。仅八月十五日到月末短短的半个月的时间，就创造出开工以来的生产新纪录一百四十八项，相当于上半年创造新纪录的七倍。进入九月以来，广大钢铁工人发扬无产阶级的大无畏的革命精神，乘胜前进，又把钢铁生产推向一个新的水平。
    鞍钢广大革命职工回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，深切体会到：工人阶级只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能充分发挥自己的领导作用。工人阶级要领导一切，就是要用毛泽东思想领导一切。因此，工人阶级必须成为活学活用毛泽东思想的模范。今年以来，鞍钢活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动形成新的高潮。从厂区到职工住宅区，从炼钢炉前到铁矿山，到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。到目前，各厂矿举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班已达五千多期，参加人数达四十多万人次。广大革命职工用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，保证伟大领袖毛主席的每一个指示和无产阶级司令部的每一个号令，都能迅速地贯彻执行。伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”鞍钢广大革命职工闻风而动，立刻掀起了声势浩大的斗、批、改的热潮。他们高举“鞍钢宪法”的伟大红旗，对党内一小撮走资派及其推行的“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等修正主义黑货，进行了大揭发，大批判，大斗争，同时把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。在革命委员会的领导下，各厂矿发动革命职工深入调查研究，坚决精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度。不少厂矿由原来的三级管理改为两级管理，革委会工作人员到生产第一线跟班劳动，逐步建立起一个机构精、人员少、面向群众的革命化的领导班子。鞍钢机关原有十九个职能处，二千五百多人，精简后只剩下四个办公室、三百多人。机构精简后，许多科室人员充实到生产第一线，机关工作的效率也提高了。各厂矿发动革命职工，破除了许多阻碍生产的规章制度，大大地解放了生产力。
    伴随着斗、批、改高潮而来的是工业生产高潮。鞍钢广大革命职工在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，深知自己肩负着重大而光荣的任务。他们一面选拔优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队，有步骤、有计划地开进学校和没有搞好斗、批、改的单位去；一面在人员减少的情况下，提出“减人要增产”的战斗口号，保证生产持续上升。鞍钢各炼铁厂革命职工在这次战斗中走在最前列，七、八月生铁产量节节上升，质量一月比一月好，九月生产水平又有上升。三个炼钢厂数十座平炉的炼钢工人，你追我赶，展开工段与工段、炉与炉、班与班的协作活动，炼钢生产更是蒸蒸日上。大型轧钢厂革命职工提前四十天完成了新型重轨的试制和生产任务。冶炼和轧钢系统相继出现的新创造、新纪录，带动了矿山、机械、动力和运输等系统生产高潮的滚滚向前。
    在革命和生产新高潮中，鞍钢各厂矿技术革命和技术革新的喜讯不断传来。第二炼钢厂十七号平炉革命职工用更新补炉等一套办法，创造出大型平炉烧结炉底使用寿命一百零四次的世界最新纪录。无缝钢管厂革命职工大胆革新生产设备和生产工艺，今年试制成功的具有国际先进水平的新产品就有六十一种，其中不少是国家建设急需的产品。铸管厂革命职工大破“专家立法、工人守法”的陈规，实现了几十项技术革新，其中革新成功的连续铸管自动化控制具有国际先进水平。这些事实证明毛主席指出的
  “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    最近，鞍钢召开了“抓革命，促生产”经验交流和授奖大会，表彰了在抓革命，促生产中做出卓越贡献的一百六十六个先进单位和七百五十一名优秀个人。广大革命职工一致表示：在大好形势下，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”，不失时机地认真搞好斗、批、改，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，做出更大的贡献。
