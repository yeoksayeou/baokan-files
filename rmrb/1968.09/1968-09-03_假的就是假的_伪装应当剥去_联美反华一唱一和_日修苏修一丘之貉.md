Fake is fake: the masquerade must be stripped away
The United States and Japan in tandem against China, Japanese and Soviet revisionists are birds of a feather

The Miyamoto clique tries to use the cover of “independence and autonomy” to hide its counter-revolutionary nature, but this will no longer work.

New China News Agency reports: The Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party is increasingly following the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, engaging in the evil deed of colluding with the United States against China.

To tighten their alliance, the Miyamoto clique and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique held two meetings in half a year. In February of this year, the Miyamoto clique and the Soviet delegation led by Suslov performed a farce of "handshakes and greetings" in Tokyo, announcing that "both sides have reached an agreement on the normalization of relations between the two parties." In early August, the Miyamoto clique delegation led by Koshida Risato met with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in Moscow, expressing a desire to "further normalize relations" and resolve to "expand cooperation between the two parties." This shows that the Miyamoto clique and the Soviet revisionist clique will further conspire together on the path of betraying the revolution.

Since the Miyamoto clique and the Soviet revisionist clique declared the "normalization of relations," they have been in cahoots in colluding with the United States against China. Last summer, when Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo met with Kosygin, this Soviet revisionist leader not only avoided discussing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" aimed at China but instead talked to Miki about how the Soviet revisionist clique wants to cooperate with the Japanese reactionary government of Sato, a running dog of U.S. imperialism, in so-called "organizing a response to aggression." This means that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique wants to use the U.S.-Japan military alliance to jointly oppose China. The Miyamoto clique immediately understood Kosygin's barefaced treacherous actions and has since stopped even pretending to oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

In the recent Japanese House of Councillors election, the Miyamoto clique shamelessly proposed the treacherous slogan of "peace, clarity, and abundance" to lull the Japanese people into complacency. Following the tune set by the Soviet revisionist leader on so-called joint "organization of a response to aggression" by the Soviet Union and Japan, they vigorously promoted the "protection" of the United States and the Soviet Union for Japan, claiming that as long as a "policy of collective security" is implemented, Japan can move forward on the path of "neutralization." The actions of the Miyamoto clique not only acknowledge the U.S. military occupation of Japan but also greatly beautify the system of U.S.-Japan "security guarantees" that enslaves the Japanese people. At the same time, the Miyamoto clique also advocates that "if a majority is obtained in the Diet, a democratic government can be formed with the task of opposing the 'Security Treaty,'" and this government can "notify" the U.S. government to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Here, the Miyamoto clique plots to lead the Japanese people's anti-U.S. movement down the parliamentary path, allowing U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over the Japanese people.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's policy towards Japan is to cooperate with U.S. imperialism, support Japanese militarism, and oppose socialist China. The Soviet revisionists spare no effort to beautify the Sato reactionary government, which is busy reviving militarism, calling it an "Asian stabilizing force" and "peace-loving." The Kremlin sets the tone, and the "Yoyogi" (note: the location of the Japanese revisionist clique in Tokyo) drums beat in unison. Recently, the Miyamoto clique's mouthpiece, the *Akahata* newspaper, has done everything possible to help the Sato reactionary government spread propaganda for the rapid revival of militarism. The *Akahata* newspaper, using almost the same tone as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, propagandizes that the so-called "right of self-defense" is a "legitimate right of self-defense inherent in the nation," a right to "prevent foreign invasion." It also bluntly states: "The meaning of defending one's own country from invasion and oppression by any country" also applies to socialist countries. The "socialist countries" referred to by the Miyamoto clique are obviously the great People's Republic of China. This is another blatant exposure of their collusion with Japanese reactionaries to oppose China.

The Miyamoto clique's willingness to act as an apologist for Japanese militarism has pleased the Japanese reactionaries. The U.S. imperialist puppet, Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, happily said in a speech: "I think the Japanese Communist Party (Miyamoto revisionist clique) has clarified more reasonable arguments on self-defense and peaceful diplomacy. I oppose communism, but I agree with the Japanese Communist Party's views on self-defense and peaceful diplomacy."

On the path of colluding with the United States against China, the Miyamoto clique is truly following the Soviet revisionist clique step by step. The Miyamoto clique's attempt to use the cover of "independence and autonomy" to hide its counter-revolutionary nature will no longer work. Fake is fake: the masquerade must be stripped away. Between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no such thing as "independence and autonomy." One must either firmly stand on the side of Marxism-Leninism or on the side of modern revisionism. The Miyamoto clique's actions in colluding with the United States against China and betraying the Japanese people's revolution show that it and the Soviet revisionist clique are birds of a feather.

### 假的就是假的　伪装应当剥去  联美反华一唱一和　日修苏修一丘之貉

    假的就是假的　伪装应当剥去
    联美反华一唱一和　日修苏修一丘之貉
    宫本集团想用“自主独立”遮羞布掩盖它反革命本质再也办不到了
    新华社讯　日共宫本修正主义集团正在步步紧跟苏联修正主义叛徒集团，干着联美反华的罪恶勾当。
    为了加紧勾结，宫本集团同苏修叛徒集团在半年之内举行了两次会谈。今年二月，宫本集团同以苏斯洛夫为首的苏修代表团在东京表演了一场“握手言欢”的丑剧，声明“双方就使两党关系正常化问题达成了协议”。八月上旬，以袴田里见为首的宫本集团代表团同苏修叛徒集团在莫斯科再次会晤，表示要“进一步使关系正常化”，并决心“扩大两党的合作”。这表明，宫本集团和苏修集团将在叛卖革命的道路上进一步同流合污。
    自从宫本集团同苏修集团声言“关系正常化”以来，它们在联美反华问题上一唱一和，狼狈为奸。去年夏天，当日本外相三木武夫同柯西金会谈时，这个苏修头目不仅避而不谈矛头指向中国的日美“安全条约”，反而对三木大谈苏修要同美帝走狗日本佐藤反动政府在所谓“组织对侵略回击”方面“进行合作”。这就是说，苏修叛徒集团要利用日美军事同盟来共同反华。宫本集团对柯西金的赤裸裸的叛卖行径，立即心领神会，它从此索性连反对日美“安全条约”的骗人口号也不唱了。
    在不久前举行的日本参议院选举活动中，宫本集团竟无耻地提出了“和平、明朗、丰富”的叛卖性口号，来麻痹日本人民的斗志。他们根据苏修头目提出的所谓苏日共同“组织对侵略回击”的调子，大肆宣传美、苏对日本的“保护”，胡说什么只要推行“集体的安全保障政策”，日本就可以沿着“中立化的道路前进”。宫本集团的这些言行，不仅承认了美帝对日本的军事占领，而且大大地美化了奴役日本人民的日美“安全保障体制”。同时，宫本集团还鼓吹什么“如果得到国会的多数，成立以反对‘安全条约’为一项任务的民主政府”，这个政府就可以“通知”美国政府废除日美“安全条约”。在这里，宫本集团阴谋把日本人民的反美运动引入议会道路的歧途，从而使美帝国主义可以安然地骑在日本人民的头上。
    苏修叛徒集团的对日政策是配合美帝国主义，扶植日本军国主义，反对社会主义中国。苏修极力为加紧复活军国主义的佐藤反动政府涂脂抹粉，说它是“亚洲的稳定力量”，是“爱好和平的”。克里姆林宫定下基调，“代代木”（按：日修集团在东京的所在地）锣鼓齐鸣。最近，宫本集团的喉舌《赤旗报》千方百计地帮助佐藤反动政府散布加速复活军国主义的舆论。《赤旗报》用同执政的自由民主党几乎同样的腔调宣传所谓“自卫权”是“固有的合法的自卫权利”，是为了“免遭外国侵略的权利”。它还露骨地说：“关于保卫自己的国家不受任何国家的侵略和压迫”的含意，“也适用于社会主义国家”。宫本集团所指的“社会主义国家”，显然是指伟大的中华人民共和国。这是他们同日本反动派穿一条连裆裤来反对中国的又一次大暴露。
    宫本集团甘心充当日本军国主义辩护士的行径，得到了日本反动派的欢心。美帝走狗日本首相佐藤荣作在一次讲话中高兴地说：“我认为日本共产党（宫本修正主义集团）在自卫及和平外交政策方面阐明了更加有根据的论点。我反对共产主义，但是我同意日本共产党关于自卫、和平外交政策的观点”。
    在联美反华的道路上，宫本集团对苏修集团真可谓亦步亦趋。宫本集团想用“自主独立”这块遮羞布来掩盖它的反革命本质，再也办不到了。假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间，没有什么“自主独立”。不是坚定地站在马克思列宁主义这一边，就是站在现代修正主义那一边。宫本集团在联美反华和叛卖日本人民革命这些方面的所作所为，说明它和苏修集团是一丘之貉。
