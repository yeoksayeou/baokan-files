	“Victory Report”

	The red flag flies high on the peaks of Tian Shan, the waves of the Yarlung Zangbo River surge, the mountains and rivers of the motherland are all red, and the waters of the Huangpu River are joyous. The drums beat rapidly, the songs ring out, the “Victory Report” has dyed Shanghai red. Swing the big hammer, beat the war drums, sparks of steel fly joyously across the sky. Wave after wave of cheers, wave after wave of laughter, the revolutionary situation is excellent. Chairman Mao points the way for us, the working class blazes the trail. Uproot the roots, bury the demons, hundreds of millions of workers leap for joy. Chairman Mao supports us, spirits are high and fighting spirit is fierce. The red flag flies high on the peaks of Tian Shan, the waves of the Yarlung Zangbo River surge, the sun shines brightly and the mountains and rivers are red, socialism is great!

    “喜报”
    上海沪东造船厂工人居有松天山顶上红旗飘，雅鲁藏布江浪滔滔，祖国山河一片红，黄浦江水乐陶陶。鼓点急，歌声高，“喜报”把上海染红了，挥大槌，擂战鼓，钢花喜得漫天飘。一阵阵欢呼一阵阵笑，革命形势无限好，毛主席替咱们指方向，工人阶级开大道。掏修根，埋群妖，亿万工人齐欢跃，毛主席为咱们撑腰杆，意气风发斗志豪。天山顶上红旗飘，雅鲁藏布江浪滔滔，阳光灿烂山河红，社会主义就是好！
