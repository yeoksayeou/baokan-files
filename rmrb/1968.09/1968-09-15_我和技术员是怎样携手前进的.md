Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Students from old schools, the majority or a large majority of them, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is extremely correct! As long as intellectuals listen to Chairman Mao's words, we, the working class, welcome them.

In our factory, we have a technician named Jiang Feng. I really like him. In 1964, he graduated from Nanjing Institute of Technology. After joining the factory, in addition to working in the technical department, he often goes to our workshop to labor. He has no airs of an intellectual, is not afraid of dirt or hard work, and respects us old workers. We immediately saw that he is a good "seedling." However, because he received bourgeois education in school and had long been detached from production labor, his purpose for participating in labor was not very clear, and his enthusiasm waxed and waned. Once, we modified an oil press into a 100-ton die-casting machine, urgently needing to cut a 300-millimeter diameter round steel into two segments. The round steel was too thick, requiring a large sawing machine to cut. However, our factory did not have such a machine. He anxiously said to me, "Master Zhou, how can we cut something so thick? Let's send it to another place for processing!" I said to him, "Sending it to another place for processing cannot guarantee the time, and it will also trouble others. Let's use a hand saw!" He was stunned and said, "Use a hand saw? Something this thick, it would take a month to cut through." I said, "Young man, Chairman Mao teaches us to 'be self-reliant,' and when encountering difficulties, we should not go around them but face them head-on and make a revolution! We should 'resolve to fight, not fearing sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory'!" I said this, and he smiled. I thought this was a good opportunity to temper him, so I said, "Come, let's cut it together, cheer each other up, and it won't take three days to finish." I found two large saw blades, and since there was no saw frame, I made a "crude" one. The two of us then started sawing. At that time, the weather was very hot, and after sawing for less than an hour, we were both covered in sweat. In less than half a day, we had sawed nearly 100 millimeters. He saw the results of his labor and was very happy. I was afraid he couldn't take it, so I found three people to replace him. In this way, it only took two and a half days to finish sawing. He said in admiration, "Master Zhou, you are amazing. An old man like you is worth four of us young guys." I smiled and said, "It's not that I am amazing, but it is the result of following Chairman Mao's directives." He nodded. Later, he became even more close to us workers, often voluntarily operating the machine and working shifts, and studying Chairman Mao's works with us, discussing production issues together.

Whenever he made a little progress, I encouraged and supported him. When I saw something he did wrong, I criticized him. One day, he came back from the technical department and told me that he planned to test the performance of various types of lead, in case of future production needs. However, their technical group leader disagreed and said he was meddling in other people's business. At that time, I heard his idea was correct, so I enthusiastically encouraged him, saying, "Don't be discouraged, we workers support you in conducting the experiment." Then, I helped him with the formula and the experiment. After two days of effort, we tested the performance of six types of lead. He excitedly said, "Things I couldn't learn from books, I learned from the worker comrades this time." Seeing this, I was overjoyed and more actively helped him, also conducting class education for him to raise his class consciousness.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I followed the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production" and boldly proposed the idea of automating the die-casting process. I shared this idea with Jiang Feng. He smiled and expressed no confidence. To be honest, I am just an uneducated worker, and I had no guarantee of success in automating die-casting. However, I had a belief: as long as we follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his directives, no matter what difficulties we encounter, we, the working class, can overcome them! I went home and lay in bed, repeatedly pondering the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Correct ideas come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice—production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." My mind became clear. The next day, I pulled him along to study Chairman Mao's great teachings and shared with him my preliminary design plan based on my decades of work experience. After hearing this, he began to take an interest in my idea, rolled up his sleeves, and expressed his willingness to work with me. During the experiment, I fully utilized his theoretical strengths, asking him to design the shape of the control cam. But no matter how he calculated, he couldn't get it right, so I encouraged him, saying, "It's okay, if it's not precise, just approximate it." He happily designed a shape. However, the cam made according to this shape did not meet the requirements. He became a bit discouraged again. I affirmed his achievements, encouraged him to continue, and together we found the problem, eventually succeeding in the experiment. Later, in selecting materials and improving the structure, he contributed a lot of effort. In just four months, China's first automatic die-casting machine was born. What the bourgeois technical "authorities" thought was impossible was achieved by workers and technicians armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This fact further inspired Jiang Feng, making him determined to better unite with the workers.

Now, Jiang Feng has moved his office desk to my workbench and "settled down" in our workshop. We are determined, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to work together and make greater contributions to our country.

### 我和技术员是怎样携手前进的

    我和技术员是怎样携手前进的 
    国防工业毛泽东思想学习班四班学员、老工人　周阿庆
    伟大的领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席这一光辉指示，非常英明！只要知识分子听毛主席的话，我们工人阶级是欢迎他们的。
    我们厂技术员蒋锋，我就挺喜欢他。一九六四年，他从南京工学院毕业。进厂后，他除了在科室工作以外，还经常到我们车间劳动。他没有知识分子架子，不嫌脏、不怕累，对我们老工人也挺尊重。我们一眼就看出，这是一棵好“苗子”。但是，由于他在学校里受的是资产阶级教育，长期脱离生产劳动，参加劳动的目的性不很明确，情绪忽冷忽热。有一次，我们把油压机改装成一百吨压铸机，急需要把一根直径三百毫米的圆钢锯成两段。圆钢太粗，要大型锯床才能锯开。可是，我厂没有这样的锯床。他着急地对我说：“阿庆师傅，这么粗怎么切断啊？送到外地去加工吧！”我对他说：“送到外地加工，时间不能保证，又要给人家增添麻烦。咱们用手锯吧！”他一听，呆住了，说：“用手锯？这样粗，一个月也锯不完。”我就说：“小伙子，毛主席教导我们要‘自力更生’，遇到困难不能绕道过去，要顶着困难干革命啊！我们要‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’才对呀。”我这么一说，他笑了。我想，这是锻炼他的好机会，就对他说：“走，咱俩一起锯，鼓鼓劲儿，不要三天就能锯完。”我找了两根大锯条，没有锯弓，我做了一个“土”的，两人就吭哧吭哧地锯起来。这时天气很热，锯了不到一个小时，就一身汗水。不到半天，我们就锯开了将近一百毫米。他看到自己劳动的成果，非常高兴。我怕他身体吃不消，就找了三个人给他替工。这样，只用了两天半的时间就锯完了。他信服地说：“阿庆师傅，还是你行。你一个老头子顶我们四个小伙子。”我笑笑说：“不是我行，这是按毛主席指示办事的结果。”他点点头。后来他就更加跟我们工人贴近了，经常主动上机床顶班干活，还和我们一起学习毛主席著作，一起研究生产问题。
    只要他有一点点进步，我就鼓励他，支持他。看到他那里做得不对，我就批评他。有一天，他从科室回来，对我说，他打算把各种型号铅的性能试验一下，以备将来生产急需。可是，他们的技术组长不同意，还说他多管闲事。当时，我一听他的想法对头，就热情地鼓励他说：“不要灰心，我们工人支持你做试验。”接着，我就帮助他一边搞配方，一边试验。经过两天的功夫，就试验出了六种铅的性能。他兴奋地说：“我在书本上学不到的东西，这次跟工人师傅学到了。”我看在眼里，喜在心里，就更主动地帮助他，还对他进行阶级教育，提高他的阶级觉悟。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，大胆地提出了使压铸自动化的设想。我把这个想法对蒋锋同志说了，他笑了笑表示没有信心。说老实话，我是个大老粗，搞压铸自动化，也没有十分把握。但是，我有一个信念：只要听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，不论有什么困难，我们工人阶级都能干得出来！我回家躺在床上，反复思索伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”心里豁然开朗。第二天，我就拉着他一起学习毛主席这一伟大教导，并把自己根据几十年工作经验想出来的初步设计方案告诉他。他听了以后，开始对我的设想有了兴趣，挽起袖子，表示要和我一起干。在试验的过程中，我充分发挥他的理论特长，叫他设计控制凸轮的形状。但他算来算去也算不出来，我就鼓励他说：“不要紧，算不精确，就算个大概吧。”他高高兴兴地设计出一个图形。但是，按这个图形做出来的凸轮，达不到要求。他又有点灰心了。我肯定了他的成绩，鼓励他继续干下去，并和他一起研究，找出了毛病，结果试验成功了。后来，在部件材料选用、结构改进上，他都出了不少力气。在短短的四个月里，我国第一台自动压铸机诞生了。资产阶级技术“权威”认为办不到的事，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人、技术人员手里办到了。这个事实，进一步鼓舞了蒋锋，使他决心更好地和工人相结合。
    现在，蒋锋把办公桌搬到了我的工作台旁边，在我们车间“安家落户”了。我们决心在毛泽东思想的光辉指引下，携手前进，为祖国作出更大的贡献。
