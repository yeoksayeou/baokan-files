Vice Premier Chen Yi Speaks at the Reception for the Korean Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires
Condemns the U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists' Collusion to Attempt to Redivide the World

The Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia cannot be compared to the Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary in 1956 to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The Soviet revisionists have encouraged Japanese militarism to expand outward and tacitly acknowledged South Korea as the sphere of influence of U.S. imperialism.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo attended the reception.

BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) — The chargé d'affaires of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, Kim Jae-suk, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and relevant officials from the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Wang Xinting, Luo Guibo, Ma Wenbo, Zhou Xihan, Tan Jieshu, Xie Huai-de, Jia Shi, Zhang Zhongru, Xiang Qian, and Ding Xilin, were invited to attend the reception.

Kim Jae-suk, the chargé d'affaires, and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception.

Kim Jae-suk reviewed the struggle of the Korean people for national independence and the achievements made in building their own country.

When talking about the U.S. imperialists occupying South Korea, Kim Jae-suk said that due to the colonial and slave policies of U.S. imperialism, South Korea has now completely become a colony and military base of U.S. imperialism. The national economy has been ruined, and the people are often threatened with their right to live under the most barbaric fascist terrorist rule. The U.S. imperialists created the evil "Korean-Japanese Treaty," bringing in the Japanese imperialists, who are the sworn enemies of the Korean people, to collude with the puppet group of Park Chung-hee, attempting to let Japanese militarism act as the vanguard of the invasion of Korea and Asia. He stated that the Korean people will definitely liberate South Korea and achieve national reunification.

He condemned the U.S. imperialists for occupying the sacred territory of Taiwan in the People's Republic of China. He said that the Chinese people will definitely smash the U.S. imperialists' plots of aggression and liberate their sacred territory.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke, representing the Chinese people and government in extending warm congratulations to the fraternal Korean people and government. He reaffirmed that the Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Korean people in their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism and for the reunification of Korea.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized the exposure of the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia and the reactionary nature of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's social imperialism, as well as the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to attempt to redivide the world. He said that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique tries to justify their fascist behavior of invading Czechoslovakia as similar to the Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary in 1956 to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, claiming it was for the need to "defend the socialist family." This is completely incomparable. In 1956, Khrushchev's revisionism had just begun to surface and had not yet taken the path of colluding with imperialism, while in Hungary, there was indeed a counter-revolutionary armed rebellion directly instigated by imperialism. The current situation is that due to the continued implementation of Khrushchev's revisionism by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the socialist achievements in both the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia have long been nullified. In essence, the "socialist family" mentioned by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique today is merely a euphemism for the sphere of influence of the Soviet revisionists.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the U.S. tacitly agreed to the Soviet revisionists' occupation of Czechoslovakia, which is a signal of the intensified counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union worldwide. It is particularly worth noting that in the struggle of the Asian people against U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has played the role of the U.S.'s number one accomplice. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique not only tries to lure Japanese militarism to "develop" Siberia but also openly advocates that Japanese militarism is "peace-loving" and an "Asian stabilizing force," singing the same tune as the U.S. On the issue of Korean reunification, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long tried to use the United Nations to bring it into the track of U.S.-Soviet "cooperation," while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and the various provocations of encouraging Japanese militarism to return to Korea. In fact, the Soviet revisionists have long tacitly acknowledged South Korea as the sphere of influence of the U.S. imperialists.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Soviet revisionists have proven with their various misdeeds that they are of the same ilk as the U.S. imperialists. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said, "U.S. imperialism and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and the day of their burial will not be far off." We firmly believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the people of all countries will one day bury U.S. imperialism, led by the United States, and modern revisionism, centered on the Soviet revisionists, thoroughly.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is excellent, and revolutionary scenes of prosperity are everywhere. Revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province), achieving a red tide across the country. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a great event in the process of achieving an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great joy in the political life of the 700 million people of our country! It declares the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places, thoroughly smashes all the counter-revolutionary rumors of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, and makes their delusional hopes of achieving "peaceful evolution" in China vanish into thin air.

He said that the revolutionary people of all countries can completely believe that in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, the Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever be their strong and most reliable revolutionary comrades.

Ambassadors from various countries to China also attended tonight's reception.

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Jae-suk, the chargé d'affaires, held a film reception on September 6 and a press conference on September 7.

    陈毅副总理在朝鲜驻华临时代办举行的国庆招待会上讲话
    谴责美帝苏修互相勾结妄图重新瓜分世界
    苏修侵捷同一九五六年苏联出兵镇压匈牙利反革命暴乱完全不能类比；苏修纵容日本军国主义向外扩张，默认南朝鲜是美帝势力范围。
    董必武副主席、郭沫若副委员长等出席了招待会
    新华社九日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑，今晚在北京举行招待会，庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立二十周年。
    中华人民共和国副主席董必武，国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，我国政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会等有关方面负责人王新亭、罗贵波、马文波、周希汉、谭家述、谢怀德、贾石、张中如、向前、丁西林，应邀出席了招待会。
    金在淑临时代办和陈毅副总理先后在招待会上讲了话。
    金在淑在讲话中回顾了朝鲜人民争取祖国独立的斗争以及在建设自己的国家中所取得的成绩。
    在谈到美帝国主义强占南朝鲜的时候，金在淑说，由于美帝国主义的殖民奴役政策，目前南朝鲜完全变成了美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地；民族经济惨遭破产，人民在最野蛮的法西斯恐怖统治下连自己生存的权利也经常遭到威胁。美帝国主义者制造罪恶的“韩日条约”，把朝鲜人民不共戴天的敌人日本帝国主义者拉进南朝鲜，使之同朴正熙傀儡集团加紧勾结，企图让日本军国主义充当侵略朝鲜和亚洲的突击队。他表示，朝鲜人民一定要解放南朝鲜，实现祖国的统一。
    他谴责美帝国主义强占中华人民共和国的神圣领土台湾。他说，中国人民必将粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋活动，解放自己的神圣领土。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话，他代表中国人民和中国政府，向兄弟的朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府表示热烈的祝贺。他重申，中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持兄弟的朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义、争取统一朝鲜的正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理着重揭露了苏联出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行和苏修叛徒集团的社会帝国主义的反动本质，以及美帝苏修互相勾结、妄图重新瓜分世界的阴谋。他说，苏修叛徒集团力图把他们侵略捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯行为说成同一九五六年苏联出兵镇压匈牙利反革命暴乱一样，是为了什么“保卫社会主义大家庭”的需要。这是完全不能类比的。一九五六年，苏联的赫鲁晓夫修正主义才开始露头，还没有走上勾结帝国主义的道路，而在匈牙利则确实发生了一次由帝国主义直接插手的反革命武装暴乱。现在的情况是，由于苏修叛徒集团继续推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义的结果，无论在苏联或捷克斯洛伐克，社会主义成果早被勾消。说穿了，今天苏修叛徒集团口中所说的“社会主义大家庭”，只不过是苏修势力范围的一个同义语。
    陈毅副总理说，美帝默契苏修占领捷克斯洛伐克，是美苏在全世界加紧反革命勾结的一个信号。这里要特别指出，在亚洲人民反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义的斗争中，苏修叛徒集团也起了美帝的头号帮凶的作用。苏修叛徒集团不仅力图勾引日本军国主义“开发”西伯利亚，而且公然宣扬日本军国主义是“爱好和平的”，是“亚洲的稳定力量”，同美帝唱的完全是一个调子。在朝鲜统一问题上，苏修叛徒集团多年以来力图通过联合国，使之纳入美苏“合作”的轨道，而对美帝霸占南朝鲜和纵容日本军国主义重返朝鲜的种种挑衅活动，竟熟视无睹，置若罔闻。事实上，苏修早已默认南朝鲜是美帝的势力范围。
    陈毅副总理说，苏修用自己所干的种种坏事，证明了他们同美帝是一丘之貉。中国人民伟大领袖毛主席说，“美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”我们坚决相信，在马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，各国人民总有一天会把以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修为中心的现代修正主义彻底埋葬。
    陈毅副总理说，当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的革命景象。全国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）已经全部成立了革命委员会，实现了全国山河一片红。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利进程中的伟大事件，是我国七亿人民政治生活中的一件大喜事！它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人反革命阴谋的彻底破产，彻底粉碎了美帝、苏修的一切反革命谣言，使他们在中国实现“和平演变”的一切痴心妄想化为泡影。
    他说，世界各国革命人民完全可以相信，在他们反对帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的斗争中，经过无产阶级文化大革命运动锻炼的中国人民将永远是他们坚强的和最可靠的革命战友。
    各国驻中国使节，也出席了今晚的招待会。
    为庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立二十周年，金在淑临时代办于六日举行了电影招待会，七日举行了记者招待会。
