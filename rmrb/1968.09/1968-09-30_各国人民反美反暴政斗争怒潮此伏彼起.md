Students in the Philippines have been holding anti-American demonstrations in Manila over the past few days, angrily denouncing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. On the 24th, two thousand students in Manila demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy. The demonstrators angrily threw stones and sticks at the U.S. Embassy and shouted slogans, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Philippines "Mutual Defense Treaty" and the dismantling of U.S. naval and air bases in the Philippines. The demonstrators also demanded that the Philippines withdraw its mercenary troops from South Vietnam and withdraw from the aggressive "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" bloc.

The demonstrators carried a black coffin, symbolizing the burial of American and British imperialism.

Students in Lebanon oppose the screening of an American film

University students and youth in the Lebanese capital Beirut held a demonstration and march on the 24th to oppose the screening of an American film that glorifies American imperialism's aggression in South Vietnam.

When the film titled "The Green Berets" was screened at a cinema in Beirut that evening, many audience members, especially students and youth, threw tomatoes and ink-filled eggs at the screen, forcing the screening to stop. They then left the cinema, smashed the cinema's facade, and held a demonstration and march. During the march, they shouted, "Down with American imperialism!" "Long live the struggle of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the struggle of the Palestinian people!"

Progressive masses in New Zealand boycott American films about the Vietnam War

Progressive masses in Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, on the 27th angrily boycotted the screening of an American film about the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

When a film about the U.S. aggression in Vietnam was screened in these two cities, some demonstrators against the U.S. war in Vietnam threw rotten eggs in the cinema and jeered and booed, expressing their boycott of the imperialist film. In Wellington, the reactionary film was forced to stop screening.

Italian construction workers hold nationwide strike

Eight hundred thousand construction workers in Italy went on a nationwide strike on the 26th, demanding wage increases, guaranteed full employment, and improved labor protection facilities. Striking workers held demonstrations and rallies in many cities across the country. Their just demands were supported by many students, with many students actively participating in the workers' demonstrations.

Chilean workers strike and occupy mine against American imperialism and local capitalists

Workers in Chile have been continuously striking, protesting against the exploitation and plunder by American imperialism and local capitalists.

Seven thousand workers at the Anglo-Lautaro Nitrate Company's South Coyahuque nitrate mine in the northern Chilean province of Antofagasta have been on strike since August 29, demanding wage increases. On the 27th, 250 workers who were on strike resolutely occupied the entrances and exits of the mine, determined to drive out the scabs who serve American imperialism. The reactionary police immediately went to suppress the workers occupying the mine, attempting to disperse them. However, the workers fearlessly persisted in occupying the mine. Their struggle was supported by the residents of the area.

German youth demonstrate against the neo-Nazi party

Thousands of young people in the German city of Osnabrück held a strong demonstration on the 27th, protesting against the activities of the neo-Nazi party, the National Democratic Party, in the city. When the leader of the Nazi party, Adolf von Thadden, arrived in the city and spoke at a party meeting, the demonstrators shouted "Nazis get out!" and threw stink bombs, tomatoes, and eggs at him, expressing their angry protest. However, the German authorities, who have always tolerated and protected fascist forces, dispatched a large number of police to escort the Nazi leader and suppress the demonstrators.
