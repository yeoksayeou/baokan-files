Hundreds of black youth in Saint Paul, Minnesota, bravely fought with police on the nights of August 30 and 31, protesting against the oppression and persecution of blacks by the police.

The spark for the struggle was on the night of the 30th when two off-duty white policemen arbitrarily confiscated a gun from a black youth, provoking the anger of hundreds of black youth. They furiously threw stones, glass bottles, and chairs at the police; some armed blacks also fired shots at the police. The battle lasted for five hours, and the police used tear gas to disperse the black crowd. The next night, black youth again took to the streets to bravely fight with the police.

In Newport News, Virginia, over 150 black residents, protesting the shooting of an innocent black man by a white police officer, fought with the police in the early hours of September 1, despite the rain. They severely beat a white police officer and threw Molotov cocktails at several stores owned by white exploiters, causing fires.

In Springfield, Ohio, over 400 black youth took to the streets in the early hours of August 31 to protest the oppression of blacks by white police during a traffic accident. The protesting crowd, divided into small groups, smashed the windows of stores owned by white exploiters, overturned and burned a truck and a car, causing traffic to come to a halt. The struggle lasted for several hours.

    美国黑人抗暴斗争连绵不断
    新华社二日讯美国明尼苏达州圣保罗市数百名黑人青少年在八月三十日和三十一日接连两晚同警察展开英勇搏斗，反抗警察对黑人的欺压和迫害。
    斗争的导火线是三十日晚上，两名下了岗的白人警察横蛮无理地缴了一名黑人青年的枪，激起了数百名黑人青少年的公愤。他们愤怒地向警察投掷石块、玻璃瓶和椅子等；一些带枪的黑人还向警察开枪射击。搏斗持续了五个小时，警察施放催泪瓦斯强行驱散了黑人群众。第二天晚上，黑人青少年又再次涌上街头同警察英勇搏斗。
    弗吉尼亚州纽波特纽斯市一百五十多名黑人群众为抗议白人警察枪杀一名无辜黑人的暴行，九月一日凌晨冒雨同警察进行了四个多小时的搏斗。他们狠狠揍了一名白人警官，并且向好几家白人剥削者的商店投掷了燃烧瓶，引起了大火。
    俄亥俄州斯普林菲尔德市四百余名黑人青年八月三十一日凌晨涌上街头，愤怒抗议白人警察在处理一次交通事故中欺压黑人。分成小股活动的抗议群众砸碎了白人剥削者商店的橱窗，推倒并烧毁了一辆卡车和一辆小汽车，使市内交通一度中断。斗争延续了好几个小时。
