"Though China and Albania are separated by mountains and seas, our hearts are united."

Led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, the Albanian Party and Government delegation arrived in Beijing today, receiving an extremely warm, enthusiastic, and cordial welcome from tens of thousands of workers and revolutionary masses of the capital. Beijing was in a frenzy. The slogans, cheers, and drumbeats echoing through the skies of Beijing composed a new chapter of Sino-Albanian friendship.

"Welcome, messengers of the heroic Albanian people!" The welcoming crowds, with Tiananmen Square as the center, extended to the wide avenues on both sides, stretching as far as the eye could see. The streets that traverse the capital's urban area for dozens of miles today became a "friendship corridor" adorned with fluttering red flags. At both ends of this "corridor," towering portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, stood tall. Above Tiananmen Square, large red balloons floated high, bearing giant banners: "Long live the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the Party of Labor of Albania!" "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!" Loudspeakers along the streets continuously played Chinese songs such as "The East is Red," "The Working Class is the Leading Class," and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," as well as Albanian songs like "Red Friendship Song" and "Praise to the Party and Enver Hoxha."

In Tiananmen Square and the nearby wide streets, rows of workers from the capital, stretching for several miles, stood in formation. There were also Red Guards from the capital's colleges and universities. They arrived early in the morning, opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read aloud: "Socialist countries are completely new types of countries, countries where the exploiting classes have been overthrown and the people take power. In the relations between these countries, the principles of internationalism and patriotism are united. Common interests and common ideals bind us closely together."

When Comrade Balluku and others, accompanied by Comrade Zhou Enlai and others, entered Tiananmen Square in open-top cars, the square was filled with an extremely enthusiastic and moving scene. Thousands of red balloons soared into the sky. A dance troupe of over 2,000 Red Guards, led by the music of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," danced gracefully in front of the Golden Water Bridge, warmly welcoming the Albanian comrades. Comrade Balluku and other Albanian comrades frequently waved to the welcoming crowds.

The workers of the capital, who have ascended the stage of the struggle against the superstructure, with a deep proletarian sentiment, repeatedly sang the song "In the world, there are friends, though far apart, they are as close as neighbors," expressing their deep affection for the Albanian people. The workers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Tsinghua University were particularly excited. They rushed to Tiananmen Square from the western suburbs early in the morning to welcome the messengers of the heroic Albanian people. Old workers said excitedly, our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is now advancing towards a comprehensive victory under the excellent situation of the whole country turning red. Comrade Enver Hoxha's important report on educational revolution and worker supervision in the first half of this year has greatly pushed forward the vigorous revolutionary movement of Albania. Both our countries are striving to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and advance along the socialist road. Recently, Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the aggressive and anti-socialist Warsaw Pact. This brave and decisive revolutionary action has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. It is truly excellent! We greatly admire and firmly support it.

The workers of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory held high the portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha, enthusiastically cheering for the great creators of the battle-friendly relationship between the two countries. The workers who personally printed millions of portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha enthusiastically praised Comrade Enver Hoxha as a great Marxist-Leninist. They said, the battle-friendly relationship between the peoples of China and Albania, created by Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, is unbreakable by any force. We firmly stand with the Albanian people, fight together, and firmly support the revolutionary action of the People's Republic of Albania withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou recently cabled to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu: "If the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." The Chinese working class will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao supports us, and we support Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has spoken our hearts.

In the center of Tiananmen Square, over a thousand railway workers warmly cheered for the Albanian comrades. The railway workers excitedly said, we, the workers of the capital standing by Chairman Mao, will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly defend the great battle-friendly relationship between the peoples of the two countries. The heroic Albanian people are our closest comrades. Their thorough revolutionary spirit is always worth learning from. An old fitter said excitedly, with Marxism-Leninism, we fear neither heaven nor earth. Albania's withdrawal from the aggressive Warsaw Pact, determined to fight to the end with the Soviet revisionists, is excellent! We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the old workers of the "February 7th" movement, seize the revolution, promote production, do well in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and support the struggle of the Albanian people with practical actions.

The workers of the Beijing First General Machinery Factory, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, brought the good news of the timely and successful completion of this year's production task for air compressors for the Albanian people, to welcome the messengers of the Albanian people. They said, the peoples of our two countries have always been mutually supportive, mutually inspiring, and fighting together, advancing side by side. Recently, on the joyous day of celebrating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of our country except Taiwan, Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu cabled to congratulate our country's rivers and mountains turning red, which is a powerful support for our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We contribute a little to the Albanian brothers, which is entirely our internationalist duty. The Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is to wholeheartedly serve the people of the world.

The workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory arrived at Tiananmen Square early in the morning. The women workers gathered together, reading from the newspaper the news from Tirana: The Central Committee of the Albanian Women's Union decided, following the teachings of the Party and Comrade Hoxha, to strengthen the revolutionary transformation of women's thoughts; the meeting unanimously agreed to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, ensuring that upon the Party's order and Comrade Hoxha's call, all women will immediately take up arms to defend the socialist motherland. A woman worker said, the path taken by Albanian women is the revolutionary path. We must unite with the people and women of Albania, and with the people and women of all countries in the world, and advance together.

The members of the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, who have deep friendships with the Albanian people, recently studied the cable from Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, and the reply from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou. They all felt extremely elated and inspired by the revolutionary battle-friendly relationship between the peoples of the two countries reaching a new peak. To prepare for welcoming the Albanian comrades, they busily worked until late last night and rushed to the city early this morning.

A female member who had visited Albania held high a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," leading the crowd in shouting slogans to pay tribute to the messengers of the heroic people. She said, during my more than twenty days in Albania, I heard many stories of the Albanian people's heroic deeds in eliminating the enemies who invaded their land. The recent mass rally of 100,000 people in Tirana fully demonstrated the fearless heroism of the Albanian people. Any enemy who dares to invade heroic Albania will only meet with self-destruction.

At the far eastern end of the welcoming crowd, which stretched for dozens of miles, in front of the giant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Red Guards enthusiastically praised the fearless revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people and the revolutionary actions of the First Youth Combat Brigade organized by the students of the University of Tirana. They said, we Chinese Red Guards must learn from the revolutionary spirit of the brave Albanian youth, under the leadership of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers, continue to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, do well in the proletarian educational revolution, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from the army, navy, and air force, who came to welcome the Albanian comrades, enthusiastically praised the battle-friendly relationship between the two parties, the two countries' peoples, and the two countries' armies. They said, the friendship between the two parties, the two countries' peoples, and the two countries' armies, established through long-term joint struggles, is unbreakable. The heroic Albanian people's brave withdrawal from the aggressive Warsaw Pact, manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, is excellent, and we firmly support it! The Party of Labor of Albania is truly a great party, the Albanian people are truly heroic, and the Albanian army is truly great. If the enemy dares to touch socialist Albania, they will surely be beaten to a pulp. They said, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever be heart-to-heart with the Albanian brothers. We will forever stand with the Albanian comrades, fight together, and win together.

    我们的心是连在一起的
    ——记首都革命群众热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团
    “中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”
    以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团今天到达北京，受到数十万首都工人和革命群众极其隆重、热烈而亲切的夹道欢迎。北京沸腾了。回荡在北京上空的口号声、欢呼声和锣鼓声，组成了一篇动人的中阿友谊的新乐章。
    “欢迎您们，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者！”欢迎的群众队伍，以天安门广场为中心，向它两翼的宽敞大道伸展开去，一眼望不到尽头。这横贯首都市区数十华里的街道，今天成了红旗飘舞的“友谊长廊”。在这“长廊”的两头，高耸着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的巨幅画像。天安门广场上空高悬的红色大气球，系着巨幅标语：“英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！”“中国—阿尔巴尼亚友谊万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”街道上的扩音器里，不断播送《全国山河一片红》、《工人阶级是领导阶级》、《大海航行靠舵手》等中国歌曲和《红色友谊之歌》、《歌颂党和恩维尔·霍查》等阿尔巴尼亚歌曲。
    在天安门广场和广场附近宽阔的大街上，排列着数华里长的首都工人队伍，还有来自首都大专院校的红卫兵小将。他们清晨来到这里时，打开《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：“社会主义国家是完全新型的国家，是推翻了剥削阶级而由劳动人民掌握权力的国家。在这些国家间的相互关系中，实现着国际主义和爱国主义相统一的原则。共同的利益和共同的理想把我们紧紧地联结在一起。”
    当巴卢库等同志由周恩来等同志陪同，分别乘敞篷车进入天安门广场的时候，广场上出现了极其热烈、动人的欢迎场面。数千个红色气球腾空升起。由两千多名红卫兵小将组成的舞蹈队，随着《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声，在金水桥前翩翩起舞，热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友。巴卢库等阿尔巴尼亚同志频频挥手向欢迎群众致意。
    豪迈地登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的工人们，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，一遍又一遍地高唱《海内存知己，天涯若比邻》的毛主席语录歌曲，表达自己对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊。驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队的工人们，心情特别激动，一清早就从西郊赶到天安门前迎接英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者。老工人们激动地说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在全国一片红的大好形势下，走向全面胜利。恩维尔·霍查同志今年上半年所作的教育革命和工人阶级监督的重要报告，把阿尔巴尼亚轰轰烈烈的革命化运动大大地推向前进。我们两国都在努力强化无产阶级专政，沿着社会主义道路前进。最近阿尔巴尼亚庄严宣布退出侵略性的反社会主义的华沙条约，这一英勇果断的革命行动，大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风，真是好得很！我们非常敬佩，坚决支持。
    北京新华印刷厂的工人们，高举毛主席的画像和霍查同志的画像，纵情欢呼中阿两国人民的战斗友谊的伟大缔造者。亲手印制了千万张恩维尔·霍查同志画像的工人们热情地赞颂恩维尔·霍查同志是伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他们说，由毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志缔造的中阿两国人民的战斗友谊，是什么力量也打不破的。我们坚决同阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起；坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约的革命行动。我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及周总理最近给霍查同志、谢胡同志的复电指出：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”中国工人阶级永远忠于毛主席，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席说出了我们的心里话。
    在天安门广场中心，一千多铁路工人向阿尔巴尼亚战友热烈欢呼。铁路工人们兴奋地说，我们在毛主席身边的首都工人，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫中阿两国人民伟大的战斗友谊。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是我国人民最亲密的战友。他们的彻底革命精神，永远值得我们学习。一位老钳工激动地说，有了马克思列宁主义，就天不怕，地不怕。阿尔巴尼亚宣布退出侵略性的华沙条约，决心和苏修干到底，他们干得好！我们一定要发扬“二七”老工人的革命传统，抓革命，促生产，搞好斗、批、改，用实际行动支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争。
    北京第一通用机械厂的工人们满怀革命豪情，带着他们刚刚提前圆满完成今年为阿尔巴尼亚人民生产空气压缩机任务的喜讯，来欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者。他们说，我们中阿两国人民，从来都是互相支持，互相鼓舞，共同战斗，并肩前进的。最近，在我们热烈庆祝全国除台湾省以外各省、市、自治区成立革命委员会的大喜日子里，霍查同志和谢胡同志来电祝贺我国山河一片红，这是对我国无产阶级文化大革命的有力支持。我们为阿尔巴尼亚兄弟出一点力，完全是自己应尽的无产阶级国际主义义务。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，就是要全心全意地为全世界人民服务。
    北京针织总厂的工人们很早就来到天安门广场。
    女工们聚在一起，朗读报纸上登的来自地拉那的消息：阿尔巴尼亚妇联中央全会决定遵照劳动党和霍查同志的教导，加强妇女思想革命化；全会一致赞同退出华沙条约，保证只要党一声令下，霍查同志发出号召，全体妇女立即拿起武器，保卫社会主义祖国。一位女工说，阿尔巴尼亚妇女所走的道路是革命的道路，我们要同阿尔巴尼亚人民和妇女，同世界各国人民和妇女团结在一起，共同前进。
    同阿尔巴尼亚人民有着深厚友谊的中阿友好人民公社的社员们，最近学习了霍查同志和谢胡同志给毛主席、林副主席和周总理的贺电，学习了毛主席、林副主席和周总理的复电，他们都为中阿两国人民革命的战斗友谊发展到一个新的高峰感到无比欢欣鼓舞。他们为了作好欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友的准备工作，昨晚兴奋地忙碌到深夜，今天一清早就赶到城里。
    曾经访问过阿尔巴尼亚的一位女社员，在欢迎队伍中举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，带头高呼口号，向英雄人民的使者致敬。她说，我在阿尔巴尼亚的二十多天中，听到许多阿尔巴尼亚人民消灭侵入他们国土的敌人的英雄事迹。最近在地拉那举行的十万人参加的阿中友好群众大会，充分显示了阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏强暴的英雄气概。任何敌人胆敢侵犯英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，只能是自取灭亡。
    在长达几十华里的欢迎队伍的最东端，在我们伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的巨幅画像前面，红卫兵小将们热情地赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民大无畏的革命精神，热情赞扬地拉那高等学校学生组织第一青年战斗旅的革命行动。他们说，我们中国的红卫兵，一定要学习英勇的阿尔巴尼亚青年的革命精神，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，继续全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，搞好无产阶级教育革命，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    前来欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友的中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军指战员，热烈称颂中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队的战斗友谊。他们说，中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队，在长期的共同斗争中建立起来的友谊是牢不可破的。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚果敢地退出苏修一手操纵的侵略性的华沙条约，这一革命行动好得很，我们坚决支持！阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不愧是伟大的党，阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧是英雄的人民，阿尔巴尼亚军队不愧是伟大的军队。如果敌人胆敢碰一下社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，它们必将碰得头破血流。他们说，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼得更加坚强的中国人民和中国人民解放军，永远和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟心连心。我们将永远同阿尔巴尼亚的战友们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
