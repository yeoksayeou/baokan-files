Beijing Agricultural Labor University's revolutionary teachers and students, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a sharp weapon, combined with their personal experiences, angrily denounced the harm caused by the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Revolutionary students said: "Most of us are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. When we entered school, we wore coarse clothes and were covered in dirt. After a few years of study, we became delicate. After graduation, we did not want to return to the countryside to work." They are determined, under the leadership of the working class, to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

The report said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution reached Beijing Agricultural Labor University. All revolutionary teachers, students, and staff were overjoyed. Under the guidance of the workers and military propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought in the capital, they organized learning and discussion sessions. Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions pointed out the direction and path for the educational revolution in schools, serving as a sharp weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system. "Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie." "It pronounced the death sentence on the revisionist educational line." Under the guidance of the workers and military propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary teachers and students closely combined the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with revolutionary criticism and denunciation. They extensively discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and severely criticized the harm of the revisionist educational line. Many departments and classes used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, combined with their personal experiences, to angrily denounce the harm caused by the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line to themselves. They said, Chairman Mao's educational line is to cultivate "socialist-conscious and cultured laborers," while the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Liu Ren, forcefully instilled the bourgeois ideas of "fame, wealth, and status" into the youth. Under the direct control of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, Beijing Agricultural Labor University became a big dye vat of the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary students painfully said: "Most of us are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. When we entered school, we wore coarse clothes and were covered in dirt. After a few years of study, we became delicate. After graduation, we did not want to return to the countryside to work." A young teacher from the Fruit Forest Department (a student who stayed after graduation) talked about his change in thinking: "In the first year, I couldn't stand it; in the second year, I followed along; in the third and fourth years, I started to change." Under the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, some students looked down on poor and lower-middle peasants, even disowned their relatives. A student from a poor peasant family, when his father came to visit the school, was ashamed of his "rustic" appearance, afraid of being looked down upon, and did not dare to acknowledge him, saying he was a visitor from the neighborhood, and did not even offer him a meal, just sent him back.

Teachers and students also angrily denounced the heinous crimes of teaching that was detached from reality, production, and proletarian politics under the rule of the revisionist educational line. They said: "Bourgeois intellectuals know nothing about agriculture. Some who teach agriculture cannot distinguish between sorghum and corn, those who teach fruit forests cannot distinguish between hawthorn and sand pear, and those who teach forestry do not know how to plant trees; one planted, one died." The theories they taught were bourgeois pseudo-scholarship. Students said: "What we learned in school doesn't match up with what we need in the countryside. Poor and lower-middle peasants criticized us, saying our vegetables don't have hearts, our radishes don't have roots, we just study books all day, and the more we study, the more foolish we become."

Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and severely criticizing the revisionist educational line, revolutionary teachers and students have an even deeper love for Chairman Mao and even greater hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. They expressed that they have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and a more conscious understanding of the workers' propaganda teams. Revolutionary teachers and students deeply realized that the reason why school education in the past was "detached from three aspects" was because the power in the school was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals, aiming to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie. Now, Chairman Mao has sent us workers' propaganda teams and will permanently lead the school, which fundamentally seizes the power of culture back into the hands of the proletariat, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's educational line. They are determined, under the leadership of the working class, to learn from workers and peasants, to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    北京农业劳动大学大学毛主席最新指示
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线
    广大革命师生以毛主席最新指示为锐利武器，结合自己的亲身体会，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害。革命学生说：“我们绝大部分是贫下中农子女，进校时，穿着粗布衣，带着一身泥，上了几年学，变得娇滴滴，毕业后不愿回农村参加劳动。”他们决心在工人阶级领导下，认真搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    本报讯　毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示传到北京农业劳动大学，广大革命师生员工无不欢欣鼓舞，在首都工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，普遍地组织了学习、讨论。大家一致认为，毛主席的最新指示指出了学校教育革命的方向和道路，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的锐利武器。“毛主席的最新指示大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风”。“宣判了修正主义教育路线的死刑”。在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队同志们的引导下，革命师生把学习毛主席最新指示和革命的大批判紧密地结合起来，大谈毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，狠批修正主义教育路线的毒害。许多系、班以毛主席最新指示为武器，结合自己的亲身体会，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害。他们说，毛主席的教育路线是要把我们培养成“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，而中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭真、陆定一、刘仁之流却极力向青年灌输“名利地位”、“升官发财”的资产阶级思想。在旧北京市委直接控制下，农业劳动大学变成了一个资产阶级的大染缸。广大革命学生痛心地说：“我们绝大部分是贫下中农子女，进校时，穿着粗布衣，带着一身泥，上了几年学，变得娇滴滴，毕业后不愿回农村参加劳动”。果林系一位青年教师（毕业留校的学生）谈到自己的思想变化时说：“第一年看不惯，第二年跟着干，第三、四年开始变”。在资产阶级思想的侵蚀下，使得有的同学瞧不起贫下中农，甚至六亲不认。一个贫农出身的学生，他的父亲来校探望时，嫌“土里土气”，怕人家看不起，不敢认，说是来的街坊，不给吃饭，就叫回去了。
    师生们还愤怒地控诉了在修正主义教育路线的统治下，教学脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离无产阶级政治的滔天罪行。他们说：“资产阶级知识分子对农业一窍不通。有的教农学的分不清高粱、玉米，教果林的分不清海棠、沙果，教林业的不会栽树，栽一棵，死一棵。”他们讲的理论，是资产阶级的假学问，同学们说：“在学校学的一套，回农村根本对不上茬，贫下中农批评我们，种的菜不长心，种萝卜不长根，天天扣书本，越扣越蠢。”
    通过学习毛主席最新指示和狠批修正主义教育路线，广大革命师生对毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨。他们表示“对毛主席最新指示体会更深刻了”，“对派工人宣传队理解的更自觉了。”广大革命师生深刻认识到，过去学校教育之所以“三脱离”，就是因为学校的大权掌握在资产阶级知识分子手里，目的是培养资产阶级的接班人。现在，毛主席给我们派来了工人宣传队，并且永远领导学校，这就从根本上把文权夺回到无产阶级手里，保证了毛主席教育路线的贯彻执行。他们决心在工人阶级的领导下，拜工农为师，学好用好毛主席的最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
