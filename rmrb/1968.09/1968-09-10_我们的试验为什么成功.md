We have studied the important editorial note in the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine and the investigative report on "The Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical College and the Educational Revolution in Technical and Scientific Universities." By linking this with our practical experience in developing the "Insecticide No. 3 for Silkworm Flies," we have deeply realized that the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants is not only the fundamental direction of the educational revolution but also the only correct path for scientific and technological personnel. The process of developing "Insecticide No. 3 for Silkworm Flies" is a process of integrating with workers and peasants, and the success of "Insecticide No. 3 for Silkworm Flies" is a fruitful result of this integration.

We are college graduates who were assigned to work as technicians at the scientific research institute. Although we all come from working-class families, due to the influence of the revisionist educational and scientific research lines, we gradually distanced ourselves from the working class, our feelings grew cold, and we developed bourgeois ideas of fame and profit. We spent our days locked in the laboratory, pursuing high, precise, and advanced theoretical research that was detached from reality.

In May 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the brilliant "May 7th Directive," which was like a beacon, illuminating the path of scientific research and pointing out the direction for our progress. We followed Chairman Mao's directive, walked out of the laboratory, and conducted investigations in the countryside. Once, we went to the Doupeng Brigade for a survey. This brigade suffered from the "maggot plague" caused by parasitic flies, resulting in a significant reduction in silkworm production. Old Yu, who raises silkworms, pointed to the maggot cocoons on the ground and said sadly, "The national property is being trampled by these maggots. Can you researchers of silkworms think of a way to help us?" Hearing Old Yu's words and recalling our past pursuit of fame and profit in research that was detached from production and reality, we became even more disgusted with the revisionist educational and scientific research lines. We resolved to take the path of integrating with workers and peasants, making scientific research serve proletarian politics and socialist construction.

Upon returning, we planned to establish a small pharmaceutical factory to develop "Insecticide No. 3 for Silkworm Flies," but unexpectedly, we encountered opposition and suppression from some people. They said things like, "Research institutions running factories are neither fish nor fowl," and "You are not doing your proper job." At that time, we were somewhat shaken in our thoughts, feeling unsupported and afraid of failure. However, the PLA propaganda team stationed at the institute and the workers of the institute firmly told us: "Your idea is in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao's 'May 7th Directive,' and your direction is correct. We firmly support you." The PLA and workers' determination to carry out Chairman Mao's directive deeply educated us and strengthened our confidence in establishing the pharmaceutical factory.

However, since our country had no resources for producing this type of pesticide, we encountered a series of technical difficulties during the experiment. One particularly challenging experiment failed several times. We went to Beijing to consult an alleged "authority" in pesticide research, but the response we received was: "Our country's level is low, and the technology for producing this pesticide is not yet mature. We should rely on imports!" Hearing this from the running dog, we were furious. What should we do? At this time, the propaganda team and worker comrades had two heart-to-heart talks with us, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "What is work? Work is struggle," "Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and cultivate a fearless spirit of creation. Do not be intimidated by famous people or authorities," and "In times of difficulty, our comrades should see achievements, see the light, and boost our courage" with us. We severely criticized the revisionist scientific research line of "expert rule" and "crawling philosophy" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and together with us, conducted experiments. This raised our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, further strengthened our determination to fight against difficulties. Afterwards, whenever we encountered problems, we learned from the workers and studied solutions together with them.

Because we insisted on integrating with workers and peasants, humbly learned from the workers, and with the help and support of worker comrades, we overcame one difficulty after another through more than forty experiments. Finally, we successfully developed "Insecticide No. 3 for Silkworm Flies" for the first time in our country.

From our practice, we have felt that the working-class masses are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, have the richest practical experience, and are the most talented. They are the creators of history. Intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants to learn good thoughts and true skills for serving the people; otherwise, they will achieve nothing. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, put down our airs, and learn from workers and peasants sincerely. We will walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants for life.

    我们的试验为什么成功
    辽宁省蚕业科学研究所技术员　张绍春　常伦武
    学习了《红旗》杂志第三期的重要编者按语和《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》的调查报告，联系试制“灭蚕蝇三号”农药的实践，使我们深刻地认识到：知识分子与工农相结合，不仅是教育革命的根本方向，也是科学技术人员唯一正确的道路。我们试制“灭蚕蝇三号”农药的过程，就是与工农相结合的过程，“灭蚕蝇三号”农药的试制成功，就是与工农相结合的丰硕成果。
    我们是大学毕业的知识分子，分配到科学研究所当技术员。虽然我们都出身在劳动人民家庭，但由于受修正主义教育路线和科学研究路线的毒害，渐渐地与劳动人民疏远了，感情淡薄了，滋长了资产阶级名利思想，成天关门大搞脱离实际的“高、精、尖”理论性研究。
    一九六六年五月，伟大领袖毛主席发表了光辉的“五·七”指示，它象一盏明灯，照亮了科学研究的道路，为我们科技人员指明了前进的方向。我们遵照毛主席的指示，走出实验室，深入农村，进行调查研究。一次，我们到陡岗大队去作调查，这个大队因遭寄生蝇“蛆害”，蚕种严重减产。养蚕的于老大爷指着满地的蛆茧，伤心地说，国家财产就这样被蝇蛆糟踏了。你们研究蚕的，能不能为俺们想想办法呀？听了于老大爷的话，回想过去追名逐利地搞那套脱离生产、脱离实际的研究，更加激起了我们对修正主义教育路线和科学研究路线的憎恨。我们决心走与工农相结合的道路，使科学研究为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务。
    回来后，我们打算办一个小药厂，试制“灭蚕蝇三号”农药，没想到竟遭到了一些人的反对和压制。他们说什么“科研单位办工厂是四不象”，“不务正业”。当时我们思想上有些动摇，感到没有人支持，怕搞不成功。解放军驻所毛泽东思想宣传队和所里的工人同志却坚定地对我们说：你们的想法符合毛主席“五·七”指示的精神，方向是对头的，我们坚决支持你们。解放军和工人同志坚决执行毛主席指示的决心，使我们深受教育，坚定了办药厂的信心。
    但是，由于我们国家没有制造这种农药的资料，我们在试验过程中，遇到了一系列技术难题。有一项较难的试验，几次都失败了。我们到北京请教一个所谓农药研究的“权威”，可是得到的回答却是：“咱们国家水平低，生产这种农药的技术还不成熟，还是靠进口吧！”听了这个洋奴才的话，我们肚子气得鼓鼓的。怎么办？这时，宣传队和工人同志两次找我们谈心，和我们一起学习毛主席“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”，“要敢想、敢说、敢干，振奋大无畏的创造精神，不要被名人、权威吓倒”，“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”等教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治所”、“爬行哲学”的修正主义科学研究路线，并和我们一起搞试验，使我们提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步坚定了同困难作斗争的决心。以后，我们遇到难题就向工人学习，和他们一起研究解决困难的办法。
    由于我们坚持与工农相结合，虚心向工人学习，在工人同志的帮助和支持下，经过四十多次试验，战胜了一个又一个困难，终于在我国首次试制成功了“灭蚕蝇三号”农药。
    我们从实践中体会到，工农群众对毛主席最忠，实践经验最丰富，最有才能。他们是历史的创造者。知识分子必须与工农相结合，才能学到为人民服务的好思想、真本事，否则将一事无成。我们决心听毛主席的话，放下架子，拜工农为师，老老实实向工农群众学习，走一辈子与工农相结合的道路。
