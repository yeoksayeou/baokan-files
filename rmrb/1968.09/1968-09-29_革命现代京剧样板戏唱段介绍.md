	Introduction to Revolutionary Model Beijing Opera Arias

	Brave and Bold, Fearless and Daring

	*Red Lantern*

	Before setting off, I drink a cup of wine with Mother,
	My body is brave and bold, fearless and daring.
	At Mount Jiu, they set a feast to befriend me,
	I will drink thousands of cups to entertain them.
	The weather is bad, and the wind and snow come suddenly,
	Mother, remember the cold and warmth at all times.
	Little Iron Girl goes out to sell goods and observe the weather,
	She must remember the accounts of coming and going.
	When tired, be careful of the door to guard against wild dogs,
	When bored, wait for the magpie to sing on the branch.
	You run around for the household affairs,
	And share the worries with Grandma.

	In the revolutionary model Beijing opera *Red Lantern*, the protagonist Li Yuhe, a railway worker and an underground member of the Communist Party, is unfortunately arrested due to a traitor. "Brave and Bold, Fearless and Daring" is a segment he sings after drinking the farewell wine prepared by his mother. This segment fully expresses the fearlessness and bravery of this vanguard fighter of the proletariat.

	The first two lines, "Before setting off, I drink a cup of wine with Mother, My body is brave and bold, fearless and daring," are high-pitched and impassioned, expressing Li Yuhe's contempt for the enemy and his fearless spirit to dare to brave any danger for the revolution. At that time, Li Yuhe was not thinking about his personal safety but about how to overcome all difficulties and deliver the secret code to the North Mountain. This important task of the Party could only be completed by Li's grandmother and Li Iron Girl. Because the enemy was present, Li Yuhe could not give detailed instructions to his grandmother and Iron Girl, so he could only use some double meanings to express his thoughts. "Mother, remember the cold and warmth at all times," and "Little Iron Girl goes out to sell goods and observe the weather" are sung deeply and implicitly, containing reminders and encouragement for Li's grandmother, as well as education and instructions for Iron Girl. The words are heavy with meaning, showing Li Yuhe's deep class feelings and his high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause.

	This segment uses the "West Pipe Fast Two-Six" rhythm. However, compared to the old "Two-Six," there are significant changes in melody, rhythm, and singing style, highlighting the calm, determined, optimistic, and heroic spirit of the proletarian hero in the face of difficulties. It is uplifting and inspiring to listen to.

	Communist Party Members Always Follow the Party's Call

	*Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*

	Communist Party members always follow the Party's call,
	And choose to bear the heaviest burdens.
	Determined to break the chains of a thousand years,
	To open the spring of happiness for the people for all generations.
	Knowing the journey is fraught with danger,
	The more dangerous it is, the more we press forward.
	No matter how the winds and clouds change,
	The wisdom of the revolution can conquer the heavens.
	With the resolve of moving mountains like Yu Gong,
	We can break through countless difficulties.
	A heart of red like a flame,
	Transformed into a sharp sword to cut down the evil.

	In the revolutionary model Beijing opera *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, in the scene "Plotting Strategy," Yang Zhenrong volunteers to disguise himself as a bandit, infiltrate Tiger Mountain, and coordinate with the pursuit team to annihilate the bandit leader, Seatiger. When requesting permission from Xiao Jianbo, Yang Zhenrong mentions four favorable conditions for going up the mountain, the most important of which is the revolutionary soldier's loyalty to the Party and the people. At this moment, a singing segment is arranged to vividly express Yang Zhenrong's boundless loyalty to the Party and the people, and his daring and victorious spirit.

	The first four lines of this segment are in "West Pipe Original Rhythm," but the first four characters "Communist Party members" are sung in "Scattered Rhythm," with a steady and firm tone, a soaring and upright melody, and enhanced by new accompaniment techniques, immediately presenting the towering image of the vanguard fighter of the proletariat. Following that, "always follow the Party's call," with a strong emphasis on the word "Party," and the words "call" are sung firmly and vividly. The next line, "To open the spring of happiness for the people for all generations," with the six words "For the people to open the," uses a new melody and color, sung very affectionately, expressing Yang Zhenrong's deep love for the people and his longing for the liberation of all humanity.

	The lines "Knowing the journey is fraught with danger, The more dangerous it is, the more we press forward" express Yang Zhenrong's determination to advance despite difficulties, and the melody shifts from "Original Rhythm" to "Fast Two-Six," accelerating the rhythm, giving a sense of irresistible momentum. To emphasize the key line "The wisdom of the revolution can conquer the heavens," the rhythm is changed to "Tight Beat Slow Singing," the accompaniment is strengthened layer by layer, and on the word "heavens," a high and powerful long melody is used. After singing "heavens," the accompaniment is further enhanced with the addition of the suona, pushing the performance to another level, expressing Yang Zhenrong's spirited, vigorous, and fearless heroism.

	The following four lines, with a strong emphasis on the word "flame" in "A heart of red like a flame," incorporate the singing style of the small male role, powerful and vigorous, highlighting the surging revolutionary spirit. The line "Transformed into a sharp sword to cut down the evil" is sung with great force and clarity, like cutting iron as if it were mud.

	When Will We Raise Our Arms and Slash the Wolves?

	*Sha Jianhu*

	The morning glow reflects on Lake Yangcheng,
	The reeds bloom, the rice fragrant, the willows line the shore.
	All thanks to the labor of the people with their two hands,
	They have painted the land of fish and rice in Jiangnan.
	Not an inch of our motherland's good mountains and rivers will be given up,
	How can we allow the Japanese devils to run rampant?
	Wounded in battle, leaving the battlefield,
	Recovering in Sha Jianhu.
	For half a month, I have been thinking of my comrades and leaders,
	I wonder where they have moved to?
	The soldiers and civilians are preparing for the counter-sweep,
	When will we raise our arms and slash the wolves?
	The wounded are eagerly awaiting their recovery,
	So that they can return to the front lines early!

	This is the first singing segment of Guo Jian'guang, the political instructor of the New Fourth Army, in the entire play. This segment expresses Guo Jian'guang's love for the country and the people, his loyalty to the revolution and the Party, and his ardent desire to return to the front lines and "raise his arms and slash the wolves."

	This segment uses a set of rhythms including "West Pipe Original Rhythm," "Flowing Water," and "Fast Rhythm," with the melody shifting from smooth and bright to powerful and uplifting, vividly showcasing Guo Jian'guang's surging thoughts as he sees the beautiful scenery of his motherland: he thinks of the Japanese invasion, his comrades and leaders, and when he and the wounded can return to the battlefield to fight the enemy. The musical transitions logically follow the character's emotional logic, making the listening experience smooth and natural.

	Before the singing, there is a prelude played mainly on the flute, with a bright and lively melody describing the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan, the waves, and the willows, followed by a transition with the erhu to start the singing, breaking away from the traditional use of drums and gongs, and setting the stage for the character's emotional expression.

	The first line, "The morning glow reflects on Lake Yangcheng," breaks away from the old singing style of "West Pipe Original Rhythm," using a new melody on the word "on," making it sound high and upright, and very open and bright. The second line, "The willows line the shore," extends a soft downward melody on the word "willows," making one think of the willow branches swaying in the wind, followed by a high octave jump on the word "line," fresh and lively, expressing youthful vitality. The next line, "They have painted the land of fish and rice in Jiangnan," extends the word "painted" to express Guo Jian'guang's deep affection for the laboring people. The line "When will we raise our arms and slash the wolves?" does not use a melody on the word "slash," making it sound firm and decisive. In the final line, "So that they can return to the front lines early," the words "early" are emphasized with two drum beats, using a "calling out" technique to raise the voice, powerfully expressing Guo Jian'guang's eager desire to return to the front lines and "slash the wolves."

    革命现代京剧样板戏唱段介绍
    浑身是胆雄赳赳
    《红灯记》
    临行喝妈一碗酒，
    浑身是胆雄赳赳。
    鸠山设宴和我交朋友，
    千杯万盏会应酬。
    时令不好风雪来得骤，
    妈要把“冷暖”时刻记心头。
    小铁梅出门卖货看气候，
    来往账目要记熟。
    困倦时留神门户防野狗，
    烦闷时等候喜鹊唱枝头。
    家中的事儿你奔走，
    要与奶奶分忧愁。
    革命现代京剧《红灯记》中的主人公——铁路工人、中共地下党员李玉和，由于叛徒的出卖，不幸被捕。《浑身是胆雄赳赳》，是李玉和在被捕前饮过母亲的壮别酒时所唱的一段。这段唱，充分表现了这个无产阶级先锋战士临危不惧、浑身是胆的英雄气概。
    头两句“临行喝妈一碗酒，浑身是胆雄赳赳”，高亢、激越，唱出了李玉和对敌人的蔑视和为革命刀山火海也敢闯的大无畏精神。当时李玉和想到的不是个人的安危，而是怎样克服一切困难，把密电码送上北山去。党的这个重要任务只能由李奶奶和李铁梅来完成了。由于敌人在场，李玉和不能对奶奶和铁梅一一嘱咐，只能用一些双关语来表达。“妈要把‘冷暖’时刻记心头”，“小铁梅出门卖货看气候”等句唱得深沉、含蓄，既有对李奶奶的提醒、鼓励，又有对铁梅的教育、嘱咐，语重心长，显示了李玉和深厚的阶级感情和对革命事业的高度责任感。
    这段唱用的是“西皮快二六”的板式。但和老的“二六”相比，在音调、节奏、唱法上都有很大的变化，突出了无产阶级英雄人物在困难面前沉着、坚定、乐观、豪迈的精神面貌，昂扬有力，听了使人深受鼓舞。　　　　　　　　　　　　（广文）
    共产党员时刻听从党召唤
    《智取威虎山》
    共产党员时刻听从党召唤，
    专拣重担挑在肩。
    一心要砸碎千年铁锁链，
    为人民开出那万代幸福泉。
    明知征途有艰险，
    越是艰险越向前。
    任凭风云多变幻，
    革命的智慧能胜天。
    立下愚公移山志，
    能破万重困难关。
    一颗红心似火焰，
    化作利剑斩凶顽。
    在革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》的《定计》一场中，杨子荣主动要求假扮土匪，打进威虎山，和追剿队里应外合，消灭座山雕匪帮。在向少剑波请战的时候，杨子荣提出了自己上山的四个有利条件，其中最重要的一个条件就是革命军人对党对人民的赤胆忠心。这时候，安排了一段唱，形象地抒发了杨子荣对党对人民的无限忠诚和敢于斗争、敢于胜利的豪情壮志。
    这段唱的前四句是“西皮原板”，但是头四个字“共产党员”是唱的“散板”，语气沉着、坚定，唱腔高昂、挺拔，再加上新的伴奏手法的烘托，一下子就把无产阶级先锋战士的高大形象亮出来了。接下来，“时刻听从党召唤”，在“党”字上甩腔，“召唤”两个字干脆有力，英姿焕发。下面“为人民开出那万代幸福泉”一句中“为人民开出那”六个字，是新的音调、新的色彩，唱得非常亲切，表现了杨子荣热爱人民的深情和对全人类获得解放的向往。
      “明知征途有艰险，越是艰险越向前”两句，内容是表达杨子荣迎着困难前进的决心，唱腔也就从“原板”转为“快二六”，节奏加快，给人一种势不可挡的感觉。下面，为了突出“革命的智慧能胜天”这关键的一句唱词，以达到高潮，先改变节奏，换成“紧打慢唱”，伴奏层层加强，在“能胜天”的“天”字上用了一个高昂有力的长拖腔。唱完“天”字以后，又在过门里加上唢呐，通过伴奏又给推上了一个层次，表现了杨子荣意气风发，斗志昂扬，一往无前的英雄气概。
    接下来的四句，在“一颗红心似火焰”的“焰”字上甩腔，吸收了小生的唱法，刚劲有力，突出了革命烈火高万丈的气势。“化作利剑斩凶顽”一句，唱得势大声宏，干脆利落，有如斩钉截铁。（钟光）
    何日里奋臂挥刀斩豺狼
    《沙家浜》
    朝霞映在阳澄湖上，
    芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行。
    全凭着劳动人民一双手，
    画出了锦绣江南鱼米乡。
    祖国的好山河寸土不让，
    岂容日寇逞凶狂。
    战斗负伤离战场，
    养伤来在沙家浜。
    半月来思念战友与首长，
    也不知转移在何方？
    军民们准备反扫荡，
    何日里奋臂挥刀斩豺狼。
    伤员们日夜盼望身健壮，
    为的是早早回前方！
    这是新四军指导员郭建光在全剧中的第一个唱段。这段唱，表现了郭建光热爱祖国、热爱人民，忠于革命、忠于党的优秀品质，抒发了郭建光身在沙家浜、心在战场、渴望早日回到前方“奋臂挥刀斩豺狼”的战斗豪情。
    这段唱，选用了“西皮原板”、“流水”、“快板”等成套板式，唱腔从舒展明快到激昂有力，生动地展示了郭建光看到祖国的大好河山，思潮汹涌起伏：他想到了日寇的侵略，想到了自己的战友与首长，想到了自己和伤员们何日能够重回战场挥刀杀敌。音乐曲调的转折是符合人物思想感情的逻辑的，听起来顺理成章，流畅自然。
    唱腔之前，有一段以笛为主奏的前奏，旋律悠扬明快，对锦绣江南的明媚风光，水波、柳浪作了描绘，然后引入胡琴过门开唱，打破用锣鼓开唱的框框，并为人物的情绪抒发作了铺叙。
    唱腔的第一句“朝霞映在阳澄湖上”的收尾，突破了“西皮原板”老的唱法，在“上”字上运用了新的唱腔，显得高昂挺拔，听来十分开阔明朗。第二句“岸柳成行”的“柳”字延续了一个柔和的下行小腔，令人想起随风摇荡的柳丝，紧接着加进一个高八度的跳跃的“垫头”，清新活泼，表现出青春的活力。下面“画出了锦绣江南鱼米乡”，在“画”字上作了延长，表现出郭建光对于劳动人民的赞美的深情。“何日里奋臂挥刀斩豺狼”的“刀”字不使腔，斩钉截铁。到末句“为的是早早回前方”，在“早早”两字下面打两楗鼓，用“叫散”拔高腔收住，有力地表达了郭建光渴望早日重返前线“斩豺狼”的心情。　　　　　（京宣）
