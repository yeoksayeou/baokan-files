Over 10,000 telephone workers in the U.S. have been on strike for over four months. On September 8, striking telephone workers in Chicago used axes to cut the important telephone cables leading to the U.S. Navy training center in the Great Lakes region, severing nearly a thousand phone lines, dealing a new blow to the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

The large-scale strike by more than 10,000 telephone workers in Illinois began on May 8 and has lasted for over four months. Since the start of the strike, telephone workers have cut telephone cables approximately 300 times. This time, the striking workers cut the important cables leading to the U.S. Navy training center, demonstrating the fighting spirit of the American working class.

    一万多名伊利诺斯州的电话工人的大罢工，从五月八日开始以来，已坚持了四个多月。从罢工开始以来，电话工人截断电话电缆约三百多次。这次，罢工工人又砍断了通往美国海军训练中心的重要电缆，显示了美国工人阶级的战斗精神。
