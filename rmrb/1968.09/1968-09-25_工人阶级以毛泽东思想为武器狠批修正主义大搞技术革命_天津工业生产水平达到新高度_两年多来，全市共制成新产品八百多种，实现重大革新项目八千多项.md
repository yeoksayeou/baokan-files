The working class in Tianjin, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has played a leading role in the Cultural Revolution and all other work, leading engineering and technical personnel to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises and scientific and technological line promoted by China's Khrushchev. They have launched technological innovations and technological revolutions, bringing the city's industrial production to a new level. According to incomplete statistics, over the past two years, the city's machinery manufacturing, metallurgy, textiles, electrical, instrumentation, instruments, and chemical industries have successfully developed more than 800 new products; major innovation projects in technology, tools, and equipment have reached more than 8,000 items.

During the great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on the industrial front in Tianjin, raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, drove the bourgeois technical authorities off the stage, and took control of the leadership of factories and enterprises. After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of managing enterprises and scientific and technological line. Through the revolutionary criticism, the proletariat's spirit was greatly boosted, and the bourgeois authority was thoroughly exposed. The political consciousness of the workers was greatly enhanced, and their wisdom was fully displayed, leading to a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution.

In the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, the working class fully played a leading and vanguard role, creating many new products and new technologies, tools, and equipment with international advanced levels. For example, more than 20 workers in the Tianjin Third Plastic Factory successfully developed a rotary injection machine, which is a product with international advanced levels. Initially, some technical personnel suggested not to develop it and to spend 320,000 yuan to import one from abroad. The worker masses studied Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and resolved to make it themselves. Under the conditions of having no data, no drawings, and lacking equipment, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and their loyalty to Chairman Mao, they used their rich practical experience and wisdom to design and manufacture the equipment themselves. After multiple trials, they finally successfully developed the rotary injection machine. This machine can simultaneously produce four different sizes of plastic shoes, with an annual output of 800,000 pairs, increasing production efficiency by three times compared to the original hot extrusion and cold pressing process, and reducing labor intensity. The use of the rotary injection machine in production has greatly increased the factory's total output value.

In the process of technological innovation and technological revolution, the working class in Tianjin fully mobilized all positive factors, vigorously promoting communist cooperation. For example, more than 120 factories and enterprises in the city, revolutionary workers, revolutionary engineering and technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres, embodying the spirit of communist cooperation, jointly developed a batch of high-level equipment for printing Chairman Mao's works in just over half a year. These equipment include large-scale high-speed book and magazine rotary presses, hot press paper type machines, plate-making machines, automatic folding machines, bookbinding machines, and saddle-stitch bookbinding machines. Previously, Tianjin had not manufactured specialized equipment for printing Chairman Mao's works. With these equipment, Tianjin's printing technology has reached a new level.

The working class in Tianjin, following Chairman Mao's great teachings on re-educating intellectuals, armed the engineering and technical personnel with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as the "expert road," "technology first," and "expert management" spread by China's Khrushchev. They helped them walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, making contributions to technological innovation and technological revolution.

    工人阶级以毛泽东思想为武器狠批修正主义大搞技术革命
    天津工业生产水平达到新高度
    两年多来，全市共制成新产品八百多种，实现重大革新项目八千多项
    据新华社天津二十四日电　天津市工人阶级紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用，带动工程技术人员，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线和科技路线，大搞技术革新和技术革命，使全市工业生产水平提到一个新高度。据不完全统计，两年多来全市机械制造、冶金、纺织、电器、仪器、仪表、化工等工业部门共试制成功新产品八百多种；在工艺、工具、设备等方面已经实现的重大革新项目达八千多项。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，天津市工业战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，把资产阶级技术权威赶下了台，掌握了工厂企业的领导大权。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线和科技路线。通过革命大批判，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。工人群众的政治觉悟大大提高，聪明智慧得到发挥，一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动随着出现。
    在群众性的技术革新和技术革命中，工人阶级充分发挥了领导作用和主力军的作用，创造了许多具有国际先进水平的新产品和新工艺、新工具、新设备。如天津第三塑料厂二十多名工人试制成功的转盘注射机，就是具有国际先进水平的产品。开始，有的技术人员主张不试制，花三十二万元从国外进口一台。工人群众学习了毛主席关于自力更生的教导，大家立志自己制造。他们在一无资料，二无图纸，三缺设备的条件下，凭着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，凭着对毛主席的一颗忠心，用自己丰富的实践经验和智慧，自己动手设计，自己制造设备。经过多次试验，终于在最近试制成功。这种转盘注射机可以同时生产四种不同规格的塑料鞋，年产八十万双，比原来用的热挤冷压工艺的生产效率提高三倍，并可减轻劳动强度。转盘注射机用于生产，使全厂的生产总值大大提高。
    在技术革新、技术革命中，天津市工人阶级充分注意调动各方面的积极因素，大力开展共产主义大协作。如全市一百二十多个工厂企业的革命工人、革命的工程技术人员和革命干部，发扬共产主义协作精神，联合作战，在半年多的时间内，制造成功了一批高水平的印制毛主席著作的成套设备。这些设备包括大型高速书刊轮转机，热压纸型机，修版机，自动折页机，裹书皮机，骑马式配页订书机等。过去天津市没有制造过印制毛主席著作的专用设备。由于有了这些设备，天津市印刷技术就提高到了一个新水平。
    天津市工人阶级遵照毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的伟大教导，用毛泽东思想武装工程技术人员，同他们一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“白专道路”、“技术第一”、“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货，帮助他们走与工农兵相结合的道路，使他们在技术革新和技术革命中作出贡献。
