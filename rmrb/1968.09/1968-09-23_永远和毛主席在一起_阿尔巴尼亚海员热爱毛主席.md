	Forever with Chairman Mao
	—Albanian Sailors Love Chairman Mao

	“The Happiest Moment Never to Be Forgotten”

	On my first day of duty on an Albanian ocean-going vessel, around ten o'clock in the morning, I saw an Albanian sailor in his fifties, holding a red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," standing respectfully in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao on the ship's wall. He sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helm" in Chinese with great enthusiasm. His powerful voice echoed across the vast South China Sea. As the clock struck ten, the old sailor jumped for joy, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" After the cheers, the old sailor calmed down and gazed at the portrait of Chairman Mao for a long time, expressing his deepest wishes from the bottom of his heart: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, Albanian sailors wish you eternal life!"

	This was the first day, and the same scene repeated on the second and third days, and every day thereafter. The old sailor's boundless love for the great teacher Chairman Mao deeply moved me. I wondered, why does he always pay his respects to Chairman Mao at ten o'clock every morning? After some inquiry, I learned that he was commemorating the happiest moment of his life.

	It was in 1967, on the 18th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, that this old sailor was invited to attend the National Day celebrations. On the reviewing stand, the old sailor's heart was filled with excitement. He sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helm" while watching his watch, eagerly awaiting the moment to see the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. At ten o'clock Beijing time, the great leader Mao Zedong arrived, ascending the Tiananmen Gate with steady steps. The old sailor's long-cherished wish finally came true. He was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down his face, and his blood boiling. He waved his red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted with all his might, "Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

	Almost a year has passed since the old sailor saw Chairman Mao, and to commemorate this joyous moment, he pays his respects to Chairman Mao's portrait every day at ten o'clock Beijing time, no matter where he sails. He said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people and the Albanian people. Seeing Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness of my life. The moment I saw Chairman Mao is the happiest moment of my life, a moment that can never be forgotten."

	Bringing Back Mao Zedong Quotations Songs to the Motherland

	One morning, on the deck of an Albanian giant ship, the sailors were singing "The East Is Red" in Chinese, facing the rising sun in the east. Their powerful voices attracted us, soldiers who had just arrived at the port to perform our duties. We all walked towards the ship.

	The Albanian sailors, seeing us, were very happy and came up to greet us, shaking hands warmly and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! The People's Liberation Army of China is good!" After shaking hands, we saw a young sailor hurriedly run back to his cabin and come out with a tape recorder, earnestly requesting us to sing a few Mao Zedong Quotations songs so he could record them.

	Why was this sailor so fond of Mao Zedong Quotations songs? As we were pondering this question, he eagerly told us the reason for recording. It turned out that during his previous voyage passing by Shanghai, he learned to sing a Mao Zedong Quotations song in Chinese: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Upon returning home, he quickly taught the whole family to sing it. At that time, the whole family was in high spirits, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The elderly father, full of joy, waved the red revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's words are the truth of the world revolution. We must resolutely overcome all difficulties, defeat the American imperialists, and defeat the Soviet revisionists to achieve the victory of the world revolution." To learn more Mao Zedong Quotations songs, the whole family entrusted this young sailor to learn more when he returns from China, so that the whole family can better follow Chairman Mao's words to revolutionize. The young sailor firmly remembered the family's instructions. This time, fearing that the time was short and he couldn't learn many songs, he specially bought this tape recorder to bring back more Mao Zedong Quotations songs to the motherland, to fulfill the family's boundless love and faith in the world revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

	The deep proletarian feelings of the Albanian sailors and people for Chairman Mao deeply moved us. Therefore, we cheerfully agreed to their request and sang "The Core Force Leading Our Cause Is the Communist Party of China" and "Friends Within the Sea, Neighbors Across the Sky" and more than ten other Mao Zedong Quotations songs.

	Expressing Deep Emotions in Front of Chairman Mao's Portrait

	One morning, we went to the Albanian ocean-going vessel to perform our duties. The Albanian sailors, seeing us, welcomed us as if we were long-lost relatives, enthusiastically coming up to greet us. As soon as they saw us, they raised their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" An old sailor in his fifties, seeing me holding a portrait of Chairman Mao embroidered with various colored threads, eagerly took it from me and carefully stroked the portrait: Chairman Mao stood on Tiananmen Gate, radiant and spirited, waving his mighty hand, symbolizing the great teacher guiding the ship of world revolution forward. He could not contain his excitement, holding the portrait of Chairman Mao high and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The entire crew of the ship immediately became lively, and we and the Albanian sailors expressed a common wish from the bottom of our hearts: "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" Seeing the words "Following Chairman Mao, the world will be red" embroidered below the portrait of Chairman Mao, the old sailor excitedly said to everyone, "Good! Good! Chairman Mao is the great teacher of all revolutionary people in the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for all revolutionary people in the world. 'Following Chairman Mao, the world will be red' is the common wish of the Chinese people, and it is also the common wish of the Albanian people and all revolutionary people in the world." He declared: Under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, together with all revolutionary people in the world, we will defeat the American imperialists, defeat the Soviet revisionists, and defeat the reactionaries of all countries!

	The old Albanian sailor's deep love for the world revolutionary leader Chairman Mao deeply moved us. From his sincere expression, one could see how eager he was to obtain such a portrait of Chairman Mao! I understood his thoughts and gave him the portrait of Chairman Mao embroidered with one needle and one thread. At that moment, the old sailor, with an extremely excited heart, held the portrait of Chairman Mao tightly to his chest, then raised it high above his head, and once again shouted without stopping, "Long live Chairman Mao!" At this moment, everyone on the ship also shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then, the old sailor walked to the bow of the ship and hung the portrait of Chairman Mao high, saying passionately, "Look! Chairman Mao is always with us, always commanding our battles. We will always follow Chairman Mao to achieve a world that is red!"

    永远和毛主席在一起
    ——阿尔巴尼亚海员热爱毛主席
    “最幸福的时刻永远不能忘”
    我登上阿尔巴尼亚远洋轮执勤的第一天，快到上午十点钟，看见一位五十多岁的阿尔巴尼亚老海员，手捧着一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，恭恭敬敬地站在轮壁上的毛主席像前，热情洋溢地用中国语放声高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，嘹亮的歌声冲出舱门，在滔滔的南海上回旋荡漾。时钟刚刚敲了十下，这位老海员欣喜若狂地跳跃起来，不断地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”欢呼一阵后，老海员又平静下来，久久凝视着毛主席像，从心底里发出了最美好的祝愿：“毛主席呀毛主席，阿尔巴尼亚海员祝您万寿无疆！”第一天是如此，第二天、第三天也是如此，以后天天如此。这位老海员对伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱，使我深受感动。我想，为什么他总是每天上午十点钟就对毛主席敬仰一番呢？经过了解，原来他是在纪念一生中最幸福的时刻。
    那是在一九六七年我们伟大祖国诞生十八周年的节日，这位老海员应邀出席了国庆观礼。在观礼台上，这位老海员的心情万分激动，一面高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，一面看着手表，焦急地期待着早点见到世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席。北京时间十点整，伟大领袖毛主席来了，毛主席迈着健壮的步伐登上天安门城楼。这位老海员多年来的美好愿望终于实现了，他热泪盈眶，热血沸腾，情不自禁地挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，尽情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    老海员自从见到毛主席到现在已经是将近一年了，为了纪念这个大喜的时刻，他不论航行到哪里，每天到了北京时间十点整，就要在毛主席像前敬仰，表示他对毛主席无限热爱。他说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，是世界革命人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民心中的红太阳。见到毛主席是我一生中最大的幸福，见到毛主席的时刻，是我一生中最幸福的时刻，最幸福的时刻永远不能忘。”

    把毛主席语录歌带回祖国
    一天清早，阿尔巴尼亚巨轮上，海员们正迎着东方冉冉升起的红日，用中国语纵情高歌《东方红》，嘹亮的歌声吸引了我们这些刚到港口担任执勤任务的战士，大家不约而同地朝这艘轮船走去。
    阿尔巴尼亚海员一见我们，都十分高兴地迎了上来，同我们热情地握手，并高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民解放军好！”握过手后，只见一位年轻的海员急急忙忙地跑回宿舍，手提一部录音机出来，恳切地要求我们唱几首毛主席语录歌，让他录音。
    为什么这位海员如此喜爱毛主席语录歌呢？正当我们考虑这个问题时，他就兴致勃勃地把录音的原因告诉了我们。原来这位海员上次航行经过上海时，学会用中国语唱了一首毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”回国后很快地教给全家人唱会了，当时全家一片欢腾，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”年老的父亲还兴高采烈地挥动着红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》激动地说：“毛主席的话是世界革命的真理。我们就是要下定决心，不怕牺牲，打倒美帝，打倒苏修，争取世界革命的胜利。”为了学会更多的毛主席语录歌，全家人都嘱咐这位海员下次再从中国回来时，一定要多学几首，让全家人更好地遵照毛主席的话干革命。年轻的海员牢牢记住亲人的嘱托。这次来中国怕时间短，不能学会很多首，于是他就特地买了这部录音机，把更多的毛主席语录歌带回祖国，以满足亲人对世界革命导师毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰的心愿。
    阿尔巴尼亚海员和人民无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，使我们深受感动。于是，我们就爽朗地答应了他们的要求，一连唱了《领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党》和《海内存知己，天涯若比邻》等十几首毛主席语录歌。

    毛主席像前表深情
    一天清晨，我们到阿尔巴尼亚远洋轮执勤。阿尔巴尼亚海员见我们来了，象见了久别重逢的亲人，热情地迎上来，一见面，就高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热烈高呼：
  “毛主席万岁！”一位五十多岁的老海员见我双手捧着一幅毛主席绣像，便兴奋地接过去，小心翼翼地抚摸着上面用各种颜色丝线绣成的毛主席像：毛主席站在天安门上，满面红光，神采奕奕，挥动着巨手，象征着伟大导师正指引世界革命航船破浪前进。他抑制不住内心的激动，双手把这幅毛主席绣像高高举起，连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”船上全体海员顿时沸腾起来，我们和阿尔巴尼亚海员从心底里发出一个共同心愿：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这位老海员看到毛主席像下还绣着“跟着毛主席，世界一片红”十个大字时，激动地对大家说：“好！好！毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大导师，毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民的灯塔。‘跟着毛主席，世界一片红’，这是中国人民的共同心愿，也是我们阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界革命人民的共同心愿。”他表示：要在毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，和全世界革命人民团结一起，打倒美帝，打倒苏修，打倒各国反动派！
    阿尔巴尼亚老海员无限热爱世界革命导师毛主席的深厚感情，使我们深受感动，从他那真挚的表情，可以看出他是多么渴望得到一幅这样的毛主席绣像啊！我看透了他的心思，就把一针一线绣起来的毛主席绣像送给了他。当时，老海员以无比激动的心情，用双手把这幅毛主席绣像紧紧贴在胸前，又将她高举过头，再一次不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”此刻，全船的人也都跟着高呼：“毛主席万岁！”然后，老海员又走到船头，将毛主席像高高挂起，并激昂地说：“看！毛主席永远和我们在一起，永远指挥我们战斗。我们要永远跟着毛主席，实现世界一片红！”
