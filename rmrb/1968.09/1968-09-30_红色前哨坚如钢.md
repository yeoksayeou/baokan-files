In the southern part of our motherland, adjacent to Hong Kong and Kowloon, there is a coastal town. A small street in the town is divided into two worlds, and class struggle is extremely sharp and complex.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, domestic and foreign class enemies took advantage of the special conditions here, colluded with each other, and internally and externally coordinated to adopt various vicious and malicious means to frantically carry out sabotage and disruption activities.

Guarding this place is the "Red Outpost Company" of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," always maintain high class vigilance, and together with local militiamen and revolutionary masses, repeatedly foiled the sabotage plots of class enemies.

This year in April, to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the comrades of the "Red Outpost Company" helped the revolutionary committee of the town set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class. As soon as the Mao Zedong Thought study class was established, it was like a huge magnetic field, attracting the broad masses. As soon as evening came, the revolutionary masses of the town, regardless of gender or age, rushed to the study class one after another, studying until deep into the night.

A few days later, something happened: a group of people from the "New Territories" of Kowloon came to play soccer with our side's youth for several days in a row, causing some young people and spectators to not be able to attend the study class on time, seriously affecting the study.

This incident caused Political Instructor Zhou Yongxiang to ponder: why did they come to play soccer precisely when we were studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and vigorously exposing the class struggle? He also learned that most of the people who came to play soccer were idle and vagrant loafers, making him even more suspicious. After thorough investigation, Zhou Yongxiang found out: imperialist elements and spy elements had specially provided clothes, subsidies, and sodas to those who came to play soccer, the longer the competition, the more they gave. The matter was clear: imperialist elements and their running dogs were attempting to use "soccer matches" as a cover to sabotage our Mao Zedong Thought study class, obstruct our attack on class enemies, and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Zhou Yongxiang reported the situation he had investigated to the masses and organized everyone in the study class to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and his latest instructions. They fiercely criticized the "class struggle is extinguished" theory spread by China's Khrushchev. The broad masses saw through the enemy's tricks and received a profound class struggle education. Those youths who participated in the "soccer match" all returned to the study class.

The class enemies' shameful plot to sabotage the Mao Zedong Thought study class and obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions was foiled. The masses became even more enthusiastic about participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. The soldiers and officers of the "Red Outpost Company" helped the revolutionary committee turn the study class into a stronghold for a fierce attack on class enemies, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon. They guided the masses to thoroughly examine their own class struggle consciousness, thoroughly review the class struggle situation in the town since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly find the new characteristics and trends of class struggle in the good situation, thoroughly expose the class struggle cover in the town, and thoroughly dig out various kinds of class enemies. As a result, a batch of deeply buried spies, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries were unearthed, the garbage left by imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang was cleared away, the obstacles to completing the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation were removed, and the proletarian dictatorship was greatly strengthened, making this red fortress standing on the frontier even more solid.

    红色前哨坚如钢
    在祖国南部毗邻港九的边防前哨，有一个海滨小镇。镇上一条小街分成两个世界，阶级斗争非常尖锐复杂。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，国内外阶级敌人利用这里的特殊条件，相互勾结，里呼外应，采取各种阴险毒辣的手段，疯狂地进行破坏捣乱活动。
    守卫在这里的是广州部队某部“红色前哨连”。广大指战员时刻牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，时刻保持高度阶级警惕，同当地民兵和广大革命群众一起，一次又一次地粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    今年四月，为了进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，“红色前哨连”的同志们帮助镇革命委员会办起了毛泽东思想学习班。毛泽东思想学习班一办起来，就象一个巨大的磁场，吸引着广大群众。一到傍晚，镇上的革命群众，不论男女老少，都争先恐后地涌向学习班，一直学到深夜。
    几天之后，发生了这样一件事：九龙“新界”过来一伙人，接连几天同我方青年比赛足球，使得一些青年和看球的群众不能按时上学习班，严重地影响了学习。
    这件事，引起了政治指导员周永祥的深思：为什么偏偏在我们学习毛主席最新指示，大揭阶级斗争盖子的时候，他们要来赛球？他又了解到，来打球的人大都是不务正业、游手好闲的浪荡子，越发觉得这里面大有文章。经过周密的调查，周永祥了解到：帝国主义分子和特务分子专门给过来赛球的人发衣服、发补贴、发汽水，比赛的时间越长，发的越多。事情很明白，这是帝国主义分子及其走狗企图以“赛球”为名，破坏我们的毛泽东思想学习班，阻挠我们向阶级敌人展开进攻，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    周永祥将调查了解到的情况向群众作了介绍，又在学习班里组织大家反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导和最新指示，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。广大群众识破了敌人的阴谋诡计，受到一场深刻的阶级斗争教育。那些参加“足球赛”的青年都又回到学习班来了。
    阶级敌人妄图破坏毛泽东思想学习班，破坏毛主席最新指示的贯彻落实的可耻阴谋被粉碎了。群众更加积极踊跃地参加毛泽东思想学习班。“红色前哨连”指战员帮助革命委员会把学习班变成向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的阵地，以毛主席最新指示为武器，引导群众大查自己的阶级斗争观念，大摆无产阶级文化大革命以来小镇上的阶级斗争情况，大找大好形势下阶级斗争的新特点、新动向，大揭镇上阶级斗争的盖子，大挖各色各样的阶级敌人。结果，挖出了一批埋得很深的特务、叛徒和反革命分子，清除了帝国主义和国民党反动派留下的垃圾，扫清了完成斗、批、改伟大任务的障碍，极大地加强了无产阶级专政，使这座屹立在边防前哨的红色堡垒更加坚固。　红哨兵
