The Beijing Military Region Engineering Corps Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team tells the story of a certain engineering company stationed in Xinjiang for eighteen years. They have encountered countless joyous events, but never have they been as excited as they are today.

Someone asks, "What's the big deal?"

"Hey, don't rush. Let me tell you from the beginning."

That evening at around eight o'clock, after the entire company finished work, the platoon leader led the team back, shouting, "One, two, three..." Before the word "four" could be uttered, suddenly they heard the broadcaster on the construction site shouting, "Hey, comrades, there will be good news broadcasted soon. Please listen before you go down the mountain."

The platoon leader heard the good news and said to Xiao Liu, "Xiao Liu!"

"Present!"

"You are the company's news reader, experienced in analyzing news. Take this opportunity to guess, what news is it today?"

Xiao Liu quickly said, "Hey, everyone, don't make noise, listen to me. The broadcaster mentioned 'good news,' 'good news' is not ordinary."

"Nonsense, if it were ordinary, you wouldn't need to guess!"

"Hey, platoon leader, don't be impatient, I haven't finished my analysis yet..."

As Xiao Liu's words fell, the thrilling news was announced:

Just as the billion military and civilian people of the entire country are advancing victoriously under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, both in the southwestern and northwestern frontiers of our country, have simultaneously been born in victory. This news is like thunder shaking the earth. The cheers on the construction site are like waves of the sea: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The slogans resonate to the heavens. The entire company's soldiers are excited, and they immediately held a big celebration. Some beat the pickaxes, some beat the shovels, some danced the yue opera, and some wrote new poems. Xiao Liu made a good suggestion: "Report, platoon leader!"

"What's the matter?"

"We should hold a meeting right here for a discussion."

"Good! I agree with your suggestion."

The comrades heard this and quickly gathered, forming a circle. The first squad leader stood up, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and spoke, "The good news broadcasted, I heard it and felt so comfortable. Tibet and Xinjiang have simultaneously established revolutionary committees. This is not ordinary. This is the great power of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, illuminating the earth red and bright. Look—from factories to mines, from schools to fields, the fire of great criticism burns fiercely, the red flag of great unity waves in the wind; Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread, seven hundred million people in China are changing the world. I celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! I sing the praises of the proletariat seizing power!"

The first squad leader was speaking enthusiastically when Xiao Liu followed up, "Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between two classes and two roads. Two years ago, Chairman Mao waved his mighty hand on Tiananmen Square, arousing thousands and millions of workers and peasants. With his mighty pen, he defeated the enemy, and the heavenly soldiers' anger surged to the heavens! He defeated China's Khrushchev, and the bourgeois reactionary line was defeated; the roots of revisionism were uprooted, and the ghosts and snakes were finished! The country is red, and the song of victory is endless."

Xiao Liu spoke with great vigor, like a heavy machine gun. "Wow, the firepower is strong!" The first squad leader listened and immediately continued, acting out while speaking, "Tibet and Xinjiang bring good news, adding flowers to brocade. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, shaking the entire world. The great victory spreads across the world, scaring all the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries! Whether it's the American imperialist wolf or the Soviet revisionist traitor group, if they hear this news, they will surely be shocked, frightened, unable to drink water or eat, sweating all over, scratching their heads and wandering around, walking a bit, standing a bit, their legs weak as if they were electrocuted..."

A burst of applause erupted, and the political instructor stood up from the crowd, "Comrades, well said, I also want to speak. We are stationed in Xinjiang, the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. Now that the country is red, what should we do?"

"Swish!" The entire company simultaneously opened their quotation books and loudly recited the second paragraph on page fifteen.

Chairman Mao said, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles."

The political instructor said, "Chairman Mao has long taught us that the class enemies will still engage in sabotage and disruption. They hate our great leader Chairman Mao the most, they hate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most, they always want to destroy the newly born revolutionary committees and dream of restoring power."

The political instructor spoke with increasing fervor, and the platoon leader patted his chest and spoke, "Pfft! This is like an ant trying to block a chariot, it's impossible. This is like an ant trying to shake a tree, it's difficult. We have Chairman Mao steering the ship, we have Mao Zedong Thought as our guide; we have the working class leading, we have seven hundred million revolutionary masses. The military and civilians are united as one, firmly grasping the gun in our hands. Our hearts are with Chairman Mao, we vow to defend the red political power. If the enemy dares to cause trouble, we will smash it to pieces!"

The political instructor praised, "Good, good, good, I praise the platoon leader's opinion. The revolutionary committee is a revolutionary flower planted by Chairman Mao, blooming everywhere. We fertilize it every day, we water it every day; we eliminate pests every day, we stand guard every day..."

At this moment, the entire company, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, unanimously vowed: Always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Do as Chairman Mao says, follow Chairman Mao's instructions; love as Chairman Mao loves, march forward as Chairman Mao waves his hand! Hand in hand with the workers and peasants, shoulder to shoulder with the workers and peasants, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, let Mao Zedong Thought shine red across the sky!

    伟大胜利传天下  
    （山东快书）
    北京部队工程兵毛泽东思想宣传队说的是某部工兵连，驻守新疆十八年。遇到的喜事无其数，高兴的劲儿从来没有象今天。（白）那位问啦：“啥事儿这么高兴？”“哎！别急，俺从头到尾给你们谈。”这一天晚上八点多，全连同志下了班。连长带队往回走，嘴里喊着“一二三……”一个“四”字还未出口，忽听得工地上广播员同志在呼喊：“喂！同志们，一会儿播
  送好消息，请大家听了以后再下山。”连长一听好消息，冲着小刘开了言：“小刘！”“到！”“你是连里的读报员，研究新闻有经验，趁这个机会你猜猜，今个的消息是那端？”小刘急忙把话说：“哎！大家别吵听俺言，广播员讲到‘好消息’，‘好消息’就是不一般。”（白）“废话，一般还用你
  猜！”“哎！连长你先别着急，俺的分析还没完呢……。”小刘的话音刚落地，振奋人心的喜讯传：
  （白）正当全国亿万军民
  在毛主席最新指示鼓舞
  下乘胜前进的时候，地
  处我国西南、西北反帝
  反修前哨的西藏自治区
  革命委员会和新疆维吾
  尔自治区革命委员会同
  时胜利诞生了。这消息好似春雷惊天地，工地上欢呼声就象海浪翻：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”口号声声冲云天。全连战士心激动，当场来了个大联欢，有的敲起十字镐，有的敲起大铁锨，有的扭起秧歌舞，有的写起新诗篇。小刘提了个好建议：“报告连长！”“啥事儿？”“俺们就地开会来座谈。”“好！同意你的意见。”同志们一听动作快，“唰……”的一下围了个圈。首先站起一班长，手捧《毛主席语录》发了言：“广播里传出的好消息，俺听着心里真舒坦，西藏、新疆同时成立了革命委员会，这个意义不平凡，这都是毛主席的最新指示威力大，照得大地红烂漫。你们看——从工厂，到矿山，从学校，到田间，大批判烈火烧得旺，大联合红旗迎风展；毛泽东思想大普及，七亿神州换新天。我欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！我歌唱无产阶级掌大权！”一班长说的正起劲，小刘接着发了言：“咱中国的文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路的大决战。两年前，毛主席在天安门上挥巨手，唤起工农千百万。挥战笔，破顽敌，天兵怒气冲霄汉！杀得那中国赫鲁晓夫垮了台，杀得那资产阶级反动路线破了产；修正主义祸根被拔掉，牛鬼蛇神完了蛋！全国山河一片红，胜利的赞歌唱不完。”小刘说得真带劲，“突突突”就象一架重机
  关。（白）嚯，火力够猛的！一班长听罢忙接上，边表演来边发言：“西藏、新疆传喜讯，这是锦上把花添。文化大革命取得伟大胜
  利，把整个世界都震撼，伟大胜利传天下，吓坏了一切帝、修、反！无论是美帝野心狼，还是苏修叛徒集团。他们要是听了这个消息，他们保险是：惊掉了魂、吓破了胆，喝不下水、吃不下饭，浑身上下冒冷汗，挠着头皮满地转，走一走，站一站，两腿发软象触电……”哗啦啦一阵掌声起，人群中站起了指导员：“同志们，说得好，俺也趁此发个言。咱们驻守在新疆，是反帝反修的最前线。如今全国一片红，我们应该怎么办？”“唰！”全连同时打开语录
  本，高声朗读十五页第二段。（白）毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”指导员说：“毛主席早就教
  导咱，阶级敌人还会从事破坏和捣乱。他们最仇恨伟大领袖
  毛主席，他们最仇恨毛主席的革命
  路线，他们时刻想搞垮新生的革
  命委员会，梦想复辟掌大权。”指导员越说火越大，连长拍着胸膛发了言：“呸！这是螳臂挡车不自
      量，这是蚍蜉撼树难上难。我们有毛主席把舵掌，我们有毛泽东思想作指
  南；我们有工人阶级来领导，我们有革命群众七万万。军民团结如一人，手中枪杆牢牢攥。红心向着毛主席，誓死保卫红政权。敌人胆敢搞破坏，彻底砸它个稀巴烂！”指导员连夸：“好好好，连长的意见俺称赞。革命委员会是毛主席亲手栽的革命花，遍地盛开朵朵鲜。咱天天为她加土壤，咱天天把她来浇灌；咱天天为她除害虫，咱天天为她把岗站……”此时刻，全连向着毛主席像，异口同声发誓言：永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席革命路线。毛主席咋说我咋做，毛主席指示我照办；毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席挥手我向前！和工农群众手挽手，和工农群众肩并肩，认真搞好斗、批、改，让毛泽东思想红满天！
