The workers of the Han Dan Metallurgical and Mining Company's Wuji Selection Plant have broken the spell of bourgeois reactionary technical authorities and, with Mao Zedong Thought as their banner, achieved major technological innovations. The entire process of mineral selection has been reduced from eight procedures to four, saving a large amount of funds and labor, and increasing the quantity and quality of the products.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 13th, "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the workers of the Wuji Selection Plant in Han Dan, Hebei Province, have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and, through intense class struggle and a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, have innovated old machinery and equipment. They have reduced the entire process of mineral selection from eight procedures to four, not only saving the state a large amount of funds and labor, but also greatly increasing the quantity and quality of the products.

Most of the machinery and equipment in this plant are imported from abroad, with complex procedures, troublesome operations, and difficult maintenance, often stopping production due to damaged parts. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the workers decided to carry out technological innovations and achieve new victories in revolution and production. At this time, a handful of class enemies and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" secretly spread rumors, saying that "common people" cannot reform foreign machinery. The workers were very angry and responded, "Without you bourgeois reactionary technical 'authorities,' the earth still turns! We have Mao Zedong Thought to command the battle, and we can create any miracle in the world."

To thoroughly smash the evil plots of class enemies to sabotage technological innovations, with the enthusiastic help of the military support team stationed in the plant, the Revolutionary Committee led the workers of the entire plant to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on class struggle. Through study, everyone had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great teaching that "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," further raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The workers brought the plant's capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" to the forefront, angrily exposing their crimes of practicing technical monopolies and stifling workers' creativity, and thoroughly criticizing their line of counter-revolutionary revisionism. On the basis of continuously improving political awareness, the workers, after arduous struggle, quickly succeeded in reforming the filtering machine, cyclone, ball mill, and other equipment. However, they were not satisfied with this and boldly proposed a plan to reduce the entire production process from eight procedures to four. Some who kowtowed to foreigners, bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," did not understand the boundless creativity of the working class. They maliciously attacked the workers' innovation plan as "nonsense" and "without scientific basis." The workers decided to carry forward the spirit of daring to revolutionize and being good at revolutionizing, insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, and fighting the political battle in the technological revolution. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, they formed a "three-in-one" combat team consisting of old workers, technicians, and leading cadres, relying firmly on the broad masses of workers and fully playing the role of the main force of the working class. After repeated research, they finally solved many difficult problems and, in just over two months, successfully implemented the innovation plan.

This innovation greatly reduced the number of machines and equipment, not only reducing the total investment in building the plant by one-third, but also saving the state a large amount of water, electricity, and labor. It changed production from being unable to complete tasks to overproducing every month, and the quality of production has also significantly improved. In the past, the plant could only produce concentrated ore of 59%, now it is 64%; in the past, it could only recover 75%, now it is 87%, truly solving the "old difficult" problem in production.

    邯郸冶金采矿公司午汲选矿厂广大工人破除对资产阶级反动技术权威的迷信
    用毛泽东思想挂帅实现重大技术革新
    选矿生产的全部流程由八道工序改为四道工序，节约了大量资金和劳动力，提高了产品的产量和质量
    据新华社石家庄十三日电　“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。在伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想鼓舞下，河北省邯郸冶金采矿公司午汲选矿厂广大工人群众破除迷信，解放思想，通过狠抓阶级斗争和深入持久地开展革命大批判，革新旧机器设备，把选矿生产的全部流程由八道工序改为四道工序，不仅为国家节约了大量资金和劳动力，而且大大提高了产品的产量和质量。
    这个厂的机器设备大部分是从外国进口的，工序复杂，操作烦琐，检修困难，经常因为机件损坏而停产。在革委会的领导下，工人群众决心大搞技术革新，夺取革命和生产的新胜利。这时，一小撮阶级敌人和资产阶级反动技术“权威”暗中煽阴风，点鬼火，胡说什么“大老粗”改革不了外国机器。工人们听了非常气愤，针锋相对地回答说：“离了你们这些资产阶级反动技术‘权威’，地球照样转！我们有毛泽东思想指挥战斗，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。”
    为了彻底粉碎阶级敌人破坏技术革新的罪恶阴谋，在驻厂解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，革委会带领全厂广大工人群众举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争。通过学习，大家对毛主席的“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，有了更深刻的领会，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。工人群众把本厂走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”拉来，愤怒地控诉了他们实行技术垄断、扼杀工人创造性的罪行，彻底批判了他们推行的反革命修正主义路线。广大工人群众在政治觉悟不断提高的基础上，经过艰苦奋战，很快成功地改革了过滤机、旋流器、球磨机等设备。但是，他们并不以此为满足，又大胆地提出把全部生产流程由八道工序改为四道工序的革新方案。一些拜倒在洋人脚下的资产阶级反动技术“权威”根本不理解工人阶级的无穷创造力，他们恶毒地攻击工人群众的革新方案是“胡思乱想”，“没有科学根据”。广大工人群众决心发扬敢于革命、善于革命的精神，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，打好技术革命中的政治仗。他们在革委会的领导下，组成有老工人、技术人员、领导干部参加的“三结合”战斗小组，坚决依靠广大工人群众，充分发挥工人阶级的主力军作用。经过反复研究，终于解决了许多疑难问题，只用了两个多月的时间就圆满地实现了革新方案。
    这一革新的成功，大大减少了机器设备，不仅使建厂投资总额减少了三分之一，而且为国家节约了大量的水、电和劳动力，使生产由不能完成任务变成月月超产，生产质量也有显著提高。过去，这个厂选出的精矿只能达到百分之五十九，现在为百分之六十四；过去只能回收百分之七十五，现在为百分之八十七，真正解决了生产上的“老大难”问题。
