The People's Voice, the official newspaper of the New Zealand Communist Party, published an article on September 10th, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' collusion with U.S. imperialism to invade Czechoslovakia. The article exposes the Soviet revisionist troops' fabrication of various pretexts to remain in Czechoslovakia.

The article points out: "The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia is carried out within the framework of Soviet-American cooperation to divide the world. For a long time, there has been an understanding between Moscow and Washington: Moscow can do as it pleases in Eastern Europe, while U.S. imperialism can do as it pleases elsewhere." "After the Soviet revisionists sent troops into Czechoslovakia, they immediately notified the U.S. President."

The article continues: "Under this understanding, the U.S. and the Soviet Union recently concluded various agreements to 'strengthen' the 'friendly relations' between the two countries. These include the so-called 'Non-Proliferation Treaty' and the mutual right to land on each other's airfields. To invade socialist China, the Soviet Union has been arming India in collusion with the United States." The article states: "While pretending to be hostile towards West Germany, the Soviet revisionists have made various efforts to increase trade and diplomatic contacts with Bonn. At the same time as the Soviet army occupied Czechoslovakia, the Soviet ambassador to West Germany hurriedly assured (West German) Chancellor Kiesinger that the occupation of Czechoslovakia would not harm Soviet-West German relations. The U.S. ambassador also told Kiesinger to avoid taking any actions that could harm U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

The article states: "The Soviet revisionists' support for the Dubček group's 'program' proves that the Soviet revisionists' claim to 'defend (Czechoslovakia's) socialism' is completely false. The joint statement issued after the meeting of the two ruling groups in Moscow announced this support. The 'program' itself is merely a continuation of the Soviet revisionists' revisionist line of fully restoring capitalism in the countries of Eastern Europe that were originally socialist."

The article states: "Under the pretext of ensuring the 'normalization' of the situation in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist troops continue to militarily occupy that country. The facts show that their so-called 'normalization' of the situation has nothing to do with the restoration of socialism; it only means that the Czechoslovak people must accept Soviet rule."

The article concludes: "The interests of the Czechoslovak working class and the masses have been completely sold out by the Soviet revisionists and their Czechoslovak accomplices. This is part of the international betrayal activities of revisionism, which colludes with imperialism everywhere to oppose the people." "The Czechoslovak people will surely recognize this betrayal. They will certainly take the road of revolutionary struggle to restore socialism and oppose the invading army and its puppets. The Soviet people will do the same."

    痛斥苏修制造借口赖在捷克斯洛伐克
    捷人民定会走上恢复社会主义、反对侵略军及其傀儡的革命斗争道路
    新华社惠灵顿十四日电　新西兰共产党机关报《人民之声》报十日发表文章，强烈谴责苏修勾结美帝侵略捷克斯洛伐克，揭露苏修侵略军制造种种借口赖在捷克斯洛伐克。
    文章指出：“苏联入侵（捷克斯洛伐克）是在苏美合作瓜分世界的范畴内进行的。长期以来，莫斯科和华盛顿之间就有了默契：莫斯科可以在东欧为所欲为，而美帝国主义则可以在别的地方为所欲为。”“苏修派兵侵入捷克斯洛伐克后，立即通知了美国总统。”
    文章接着说：“在这种默契下，美苏最近缔结了各种协定，‘加强’两国间的‘友好关系’。其中包括所谓‘防止核扩散条约’和互相享有在对方机场降落的权利。为了侵略社会主义的中国，苏联同美国一直在武装印度。”文章说：“苏修在假装敌视西德的同时，早就作了种种努力增加同波恩的贸易和外交接触。在苏军侵占捷克斯洛伐克的同时，苏联驻西德大使急急忙忙向（西德）总理基辛格保证，（苏修）侵占（捷克斯洛伐克）决不会损害苏联和西德的关系。美国大使也告诉基辛格避免采取任何足以损害美苏合作的行动。”
    文章说：“苏修支持杜布切克集团的‘政策纲领’，这就证明，苏修说什么‘保卫（捷克斯洛伐克）社会主义’完全是假的。两个统治集团在莫斯科会谈后发表的公报宣布了这种支持。‘纲领’本身只不过是苏修在东欧原来曾经是社会主义的国家中，推行全面复辟资本主义的修正主义路线的继续。”
    文章说：“借口保证捷克斯洛伐克局势‘正常化’，苏修军队继续对那个国家实行军事占领。事实表明，他们所谓的局势‘正常化’同恢复社会主义毫无关系，只不过意味着要捷克斯洛伐克人民接受苏联的统治。”
    文章最后说：“捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和群众的利益已被苏修及其捷克斯洛伐克同伙卖得精光。这是修正主义在国际上叛卖活动的一部分，修正主义到处同帝国主义勾结，反对人民。”“捷克斯洛伐克人民必将认识到这种叛卖行径。他们一定会走上为恢复社会主义、反对侵略军及其傀儡的革命斗争的道路。苏联人民也一定会这样做。”
