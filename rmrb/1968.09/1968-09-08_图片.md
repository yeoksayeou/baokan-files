In front of Tiananmen Square, red flags flutter and drums beat loudly. Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the capital took to the streets in a parade, enthusiastically cheering the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. They celebrate the redness of the entire country, celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and hail the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.
