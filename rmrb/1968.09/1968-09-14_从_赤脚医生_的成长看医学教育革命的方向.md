Barefoot Doctors are the affectionate name given by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shanghai's suburbs to semi-farmer, semi-medical health workers.

In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants of Shanghai's suburbs hoisted the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and marched forward bravely. The publication of Chairman Mao's two poems, "Expelling the Pestilence," greatly inspired their revolutionary enthusiasm for preventing and eradicating diseases. The medical community in Shanghai responded to Chairman Mao's great call, organizing a million-strong army to go to the countryside, working with various people's communes' health centers to train and teach a large number of non-full-time health workers in a short period. According to statistics in June 1960, the entire city's ten counties had 2,500 production brigades with 3,900 health workers. They vigorously carried out medical treatment, prevention, and propaganda work, making remarkable achievements in changing the medical and health conditions in rural areas.

In August 1961, the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in Shanghai's health sector brazenly promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, issuing a malicious report slandering the brigade health workers and ordering them to abandon their medicine bags. The new type of rural health team born in the Great Leap Forward era was dismantled, leaving only 300 out of the original 3,900.

In 1963 and 1964, during the great socialist education movement in rural areas, Shanghai's suburbs gradually rebuilt and restored the health network. The number of brigade health workers increased from 300 to 2,300. On June 26, 1965, Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas." With the support of mobile medical teams, the suburbs of various counties comprehensively rectified and trained semi-farmer, semi-medical "barefoot doctors," increasing the total number to 4,500, with an average of 1.8 per brigade. They also trained 29,000 production team health workers under the guidance of "barefoot doctors." Thus, the health network in the suburbs fully developed.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of "barefoot doctors" emerged. After being tempered by the storms of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, this team further grew, consolidated, and improved.

In the struggle, Chansha County's Jiang Town Commune also nurtured a group of "barefoot doctors." Jiang Town Commune is located by the East China Sea, with a total population of 28,000. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they trained 19 health workers, established health stations in various brigades, and selected six health activists to study at the county health school for ten months before returning to work in the commune. However, around 1961, they were also cut down. In 1963, following the central government's directive to eradicate certain infectious diseases in Shanghai's suburbs, Jiang Town Commune rebuilt the health network, with various production brigades and teams selecting part-time health workers. In 1965, they began training "barefoot doctors." After being tempered by the Cultural Revolution, this team further grew.

The poor and lower-middle peasants need such a new type of medical and health team.

"Barefoot doctors" spend about half of their time working, and the brigades provide them with little subsidy, making them affordable for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Their income is at the level of general laborers in rural areas. For example, last year, in the rich brigade of Dongbin, a "barefoot doctor's" annual income was 300 yuan, including 100 yuan from labor, 125 yuan from fees for visits, injections (5 fen per visit), and midwifery (3 yuan per visit) handed over to the brigade, and 75 yuan in actual subsidy from the brigade. In the poor brigade of Minli, a "barefoot doctor's" annual income was over 200 yuan, including 54 yuan from labor, 92 yuan from fees for visits and injections handed over to the brigade, and 61 yuan in actual subsidy from the brigade. Both brigades have over 1,300 people, with each poor and lower-middle peasant subsidizing the "barefoot doctor" about 4 or 5 fen per year.

"Barefoot doctors" are the vanguards in changing rural medical and health conditions, and the poor and lower-middle peasants need them. In Xinlong Brigade, a child of a poor peasant fell ill. First, a rogue came to "treat" the disease, swindling over ten yuan with a single injection of anilinamide worth a few jiao, but the child's high fever did not subside. The "barefoot doctor" took the initiative to visit, carefully treated the illness, and the family spent only a few yuan, and the child recovered. There are many such examples, which made the poor and lower-middle peasants realize: medical and health power must be in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the health sector, hospitals were all set up in cities far from rural areas, making it inconvenient to seek medical treatment. It was truly the case that "when the ambulance rings, a pig is raised in vain." In 1963, a child of a poor peasant in Chenhu Brigade contracted Japanese encephalitis. Due to the lack of a nearby hospital, the condition worsened, and after being sent to Shanghai for treatment and staying in the hospital for a month, the child became disabled, and over 300 yuan was spent. During the Cultural Revolution, another child of a poor peasant in this brigade contracted Japanese encephalitis. The "barefoot doctor" discovered it in time, administered medicine promptly, controlled the condition, and personally sent the child to the county hospital for treatment. The child recovered in a week, spending only 20 yuan. "Barefoot doctors" also played a significant role in implementing the "prevention-first" policy. A "barefoot doctor" in a brigade, under the leadership of the brigade, worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage manure and water, significantly reducing mosquitoes and flies, effectively preventing epidemics. Taking meningitis and Japanese encephalitis as examples, there were 200 cases in 1966, but almost none occurred this year. Their work in managing manure and water was praised by those who came to the commune to observe public health conditions. At the same time, with the "barefoot doctors," the poor and lower-middle peasants have more say in medical and health matters. A poor peasant patient was sent to the county people's hospital for treatment by a "barefoot doctor." There, a medical worker whose worldview had not been reformed kept a thermometer in his mouth for one hour and three minutes without taking it out. This poor peasant, with the support of the "barefoot doctor," criticized this discriminatory and bad medical attitude on the spot.

Currently, Jiang Town Commune has 28 "barefoot doctors," distributed across 21 brigades. Their average age is 23, and most are children of poor and lower-middle peasants with only primary or junior high school education. Some have only studied for two and a half years.

This commune uses two methods to train "barefoot doctors":

One method is collective training by the commune health center. There is a fierce struggle between the two lines here. Before the Cultural Revolution, a completely "detached" training was conducted. At that time, the practices of the old medical school were brought into the training class, with eight classes a day, from books to books, emphasizing "standardization" and "systematicness." After closing the doors for training, although it had some effect, bourgeois ideas of fame and profit also infiltrated them. Some bought expensive foreign books, carrying them around in the countryside, and some "barefoot doctors" no longer wanted to be barefoot, hoping to go to the city to wear white coats and become "doctors." During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants personally managed the training, combining with the commune health center and assisted by the mobile medical team, they held training classes in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. During the two-month training period, "barefoot doctors" also participated in the leadership of the training class. They used the "Three Articles" as the basic teaching materials, and the poor and lower-middle peasants personally conducted class education for them; and closely combined with practical problems raised from practice to conduct professional teaching. At the end of the training class, everyone expressed their determination to be "barefoot doctors" who serve the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly.

Another method is to cultivate them in practice. This is an important method for training "barefoot doctors." Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's business. Often it is not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing first and then learning. Doing is learning." After returning to the production brigade, the poor and lower-middle peasants provided "barefoot doctors" with a broad field for medical practice. They said: "We want to make the chicken fly into the sky." In some brigades, all minor and major illnesses are treated by "barefoot doctors." They have about 1,500 treatment opportunities per year. While a professional doctor in this commune, who studied for five years in a medical school, has only encountered a few hundred patients. At the same time, with the guidance of "three-in-one doctors" (doctors who eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants) and "area doctors" (doctors responsible for the medical work of two or three brigades) from the commune health center, or medical personnel from the mobile medical team, "barefoot doctors" improve rapidly. For example, one "barefoot doctor" through the guidance of medical personnel, can now independently diagnose and treat heart disease patients, effectively controlling the development of the condition.

Training "barefoot doctors" also involves the issue of which class holds the leadership. If the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants do not seize this leadership, "barefoot doctors" cannot be trained and grown. First, good training objects must be selected. In Dagou Brigade, there was a nurse who was sent down from the city a few years ago. Some community members considered asking her to be a "barefoot doctor." However, she initially calculated work points and remuneration, and the poor and lower-middle peasants did not choose her but chose another daughter of a poor peasant. This daughter of a poor peasant had only completed primary school, was the brigade's accountant and storekeeper, and was praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants for being clear about public and private matters. Next, it is important to grasp ideological education. In one brigade, the education of the "barefoot doctor" was relaxed, resulting in her being corrupted by bourgeois ideas, marrying a rich peasant's son, and collapsing. While in a neighboring brigade, the family often held bitter memory meetings and sharing sessions for the "barefoot doctor," and the production brigade invited her to participate in the brigade's Mao Zedong Thought study class and central group study, making her grow into a Communist Party member. Before the Cultural Revolution, due to the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, a small handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois doctors discriminated against and obstructed the growth of "barefoot doctors" in every way. They were not allowed to use medicines they had already mastered, and prescriptions they had already been able to write were not allowed. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses seized the leadership of the commune health center, breaking through the aforementioned various rules and regulations, and creating favorable conditions for the growth of "barefoot doctors."

The business training of 28 "barefoot doctors" in Jiang Town Commune is specifically responsible for a doctor who graduated from a certain medical college in the city. Over the years, he has established feelings with the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, understanding that to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," he must not only practice himself but also take training "barefoot doctors" as an important task. He personally compiled a large number of simple rural medical and health teaching materials, introduced some excellent rural popular medical books, organized "barefoot doctors" to carry out extensive "soldier-teaching-soldier" activities, focusing on cultivating their self-study abilities, making them quickly enter the field in practice. The facts show that it is not difficult to enter the field. For example, a "barefoot doctor" who did not undergo collective training, through self-study and "soldier-teaching-soldier" activities, rapidly improved his professional abilities, once independently cured a patient with pleurisy. Later, he participated in a short training session, and his progress was even faster than that of other "barefoot doctors." This doctor who came from the city to the countryside proved that most or the majority of students trained in old schools can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have inventions and creations. However, they must be under the correct line leadership, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcome by workers, peasants, and soldiers. If you don't believe it, look at the doctor from Shanghai Chansha County Jiang Town Commune.

Under the education and training of the poor and lower-middle peasants, "barefoot doctors" follow the path of coming from the poor and lower-middle peasants and going to the poor and lower-middle peasants, coming from rural practice and going to rural practice.

After more than two years of practice, the medical skills of "barefoot doctors" have significantly improved. They can generally use nearly 100 kinds of medicines, treat nearly 100 kinds of common and frequent diseases in rural areas, perform acupuncture on more than 100 acupuncture points, and can also treat measles, pneumonia, pleurisy, and other common serious diseases in rural areas. Some "barefoot doctors'" actual work abilities have surpassed some doctors in the commune health center who graduated from school but lack practical experience. For example: A doctor who claimed to have studied for nearly 20 years misdiagnosed appendicitis as ordinary gastroenteritis, resulting in the patient's condition worsening into peritonitis; later, a "barefoot doctor" was invited, who quickly made the correct diagnosis, avoiding life-threatening danger.

This can also be seen from the comparison of two doctors of similar age but different experiences in the commune health center:

One is a graduate of a certain medical college who mainly studied surgery and internal medicine, studied dead books for five years, and his nearsightedness increased from 300 degrees to 625 degrees. He has been working for four years but has poor abilities and cannot even diagnose meningitis and pleurisy. Once, he delivered a stillborn premature baby, and during the clinical procedure, he desperately recited the book knowledge he had memorized in school, becoming flustered and helpless. These people should be educated to gradually gain transformation.

The other doctor is from a poor peasant background, with only a junior high school education, and was a health activist for pest control and disease prevention during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. He was sent to the county health school to study for ten months and later worked in the commune health center. After a few years of work, he underwent seven months of surgical training. Currently, under the condition of relatively poor medical equipment, he can perform hernia repair and sterilization surgeries. After being tempered by the Cultural Revolution, he has become a responsible person in the commune health center's revolutionary committee.

This stark contrast exposes the serious problems of the old medical education system (the entire education system) being detached from politics and practice, and shows the great vitality of the development of this new type of medical and health team, "barefoot doctors."

The reason why "barefoot doctors" make rapid progress in technology is fundamentally because they love Chairman Mao, love the new socialist countryside, and love the poor and lower-middle peasants. A "barefoot doctor" whose most relatives are in Shanghai has not left the brigade for nearly two years. In the brigade, there is a 70-year-old paralyzed poor peasant grandmother who often urinates and defecates on herself. The "barefoot doctor" goes to her bed every day to help her inject and change clothes. The old grandmother said emotionally: "Chairman Mao is so good! Otherwise, I would have died, and no one would know. This child is better than my own child!"

From the growth of "barefoot doctors," we can see some issues in the medical education revolution in medical colleges.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiang Town Commune have realized that to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," it is necessary to carry out the education revolution in medical colleges. They studied Chairman Mao's series of latest directives on education revolution and believed:

(1) Medical education must serve proletarian politics. The poor and lower-middle peasants talked about two young people in the commune who simultaneously served as "barefoot doctors": one was later sent to study at the semi-farmer, semi-medical college in Jiading (only high school graduates can enroll). This college was a key focus of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Yang Xiguang. After three years, this "barefoot doctor" became a white-collar scholar, rarely talking to the poor and lower-middle peasants at home. She did not want to return to work in her original commune, let alone return to her original brigade to be a "barefoot doctor." The other had only studied for two and a half years, and after three years of struggle and tempering, her political awareness was raised. She loved the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural medical work even more, saying: "When the medicine in my bag runs out, I am more anxious than when the rice at home runs out." In terms of medical technology, the latter also surpassed the former. The poor and lower-middle peasants sighed: "If education is not revolutionary, even if it is our child sent there, it will also produce revisionism!" They believed that medical education must be led by proletarian politics, must take the "Three Articles" and "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as compulsory courses; must implement the principle of combining theory with practice, and students should study in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

(2) The main objects of enrollment in medical colleges should be "barefoot doctors" and health workers. Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "We should select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." The poor and lower-middle peasants believe that "barefoot doctors" should roll around in the countryside for two or three years before entering medical colleges to study, and this method is good. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "In the future, when medical colleges enroll students, we will send 'barefoot doctors' to study for a few years and then return to serve us." Jiang Town Commune selected 144 part-time health workers from various production teams, mainly trained by "barefoot doctors." After training, there will be more "barefoot doctors," and some can be selected to study in medical colleges for one or two years or two or three years.

(3) Insist on raising the level on the basis of popularization. The poor and lower-middle peasants believe that currently, the most important thing in medicine is popularization, but it is also necessary to raise the level, and it must be raised in the direction needed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Those so-called "improvements" for a small number of urban lords and ladies must be thoroughly criticized. The poor and lower-middle peasants also believe: "Among the 'barefoot doctors,' except for a few who enter schools to study, the vast majority should insist on taking root in rural areas and can adopt the method of periodic exchange between health center doctors and 'barefoot doctors' to raise their level. This way, it is beneficial to the reform of the original medical and health team and to raise the level of 'barefoot doctors' in practice."

    从“赤脚医生”的成长看医学教育革命的方向
    ——上海市的调查报告
              前言
    “赤脚医生”是上海郊区贫下中农对半农半医卫生员的亲热的称呼。
    一九五八年，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，上海郊区广大贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进。毛主席《送瘟神》两首诗的发表，极大地激励了他们防病灭病的革命热情。上海医务界响应毛主席的伟大号召，组织万人大军下乡，配合各人民公社卫生院，短期培训和带教了大批不脱产的卫生员。据一九六○年六月统计，全市十个县二千五百多个生产大队，共有卫生员三千九百多名。他们大力进行医疗、预防、宣传工作，为改变农村医疗卫生状况，做出了显著的成绩。
    一九六一年八月，中国赫鲁晓夫在上海卫生战线的代理人，肆无忌惮地推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，抛出了一份恶毒污蔑大队卫生员的黑报告，强令卫生员丢下药包。大跃进时代诞生的这支新型的农村卫生队伍被整垮了，三千九百多人只留下了三百多人。
    一九六三、六四年，在伟大的农村社会主义教育运动中，上海郊区又逐步重建和恢复保健网。大队卫生员从三百多人增加到二千三百多人。一九六五年六月二十六日，毛主席发出了“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示，郊区各县在巡回医疗队的配合下，全面整顿和培训半农半医的“赤脚医生”，总人数发展到四千五百多人，平均每一个大队有一点八人；并由“赤脚医生”带训了二万九千多名生产队卫生员。至此，郊县保健网全面发展起来了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，又涌现了一大批“赤脚医生”。经过阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的大风大浪的锤炼，这支队伍得到进一步壮大、巩固和提高。
    在斗争中，川沙县江镇公社也成长了一批“赤脚医生”。江镇公社位于东海之滨，全公社二万八千多人。在一九五八年的大跃进年代，他们培训了十九名卫生员，各大队建立了卫生站，并且选拔了六个卫生积极分子，送到县卫生学校学习十个月后，又回公社工作。但是，一九六一年前后，他们同样被一刀砍掉了。一九六三年，在中央一定要消灭上海郊区某种传染病的指示下达后，江镇公社重建卫生网，各生产大队和生产队都选拔了业余卫生员。一九六五年开始培训“赤脚医生”。经过文化大革命的锻炼，这支队伍进一步成长起来。
      贫下中农需要这样一支新型的
          医疗卫生队伍
    “赤脚医生”平时有一半左右时间参加劳动，生产大队对他们的补贴不多，贫下中农养得起。他们的收入保持农村一般同等劳动力的水平。以去年为例：在富队东滨大队，“赤脚医生”的年收入为三百元，其中劳动收入为一百元，上交大队的出诊费、注射费（每次五分）及助产费（每次三元）为一百二十五元，大队实际补贴为七十五元。在穷队民利大队，“赤脚医生”的年收入为二百余元，其中劳动收入为五十四元，上交大队的出诊费、注射费为九十二元，大队实际补贴为六十一元。两个大队都有一千三百多人，平均每个贫下中农一年补贴“赤脚医生”四、五分钱。
      “赤脚医生”是改变农村医疗卫生状况的尖兵，贫下中农需要他们。新龙大队一个贫农的孩子得病，先由一个流窜来的坏人来“看”病，几角钱的一针安乃近就骗走了十多元，而孩子的高烧仍旧没有退。“赤脚医生”主动上门，细心治疗，病家只花了三元多钱，病就好了。这样的例子很多，这就使贫下中农懂得：医疗卫生大权一定要由贫下中农自己掌握。由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在卫生战线的代理人推行反革命修正主义的医疗卫生路线，医院都设立在远离农村的城镇，就医不便，真是“救护车一响，家里一只猪白养”。一九六三年，陈湖大队一个贫农的孩子得乙型脑炎，由于附近没有医院，病情恶化，送到上海医疗，住院一个月，小孩残废了，还花了三百多元钱。文化大革命期间，这个大队又有一个贫农的孩子得乙型脑炎，“赤脚医生”及时发现，迅速施药，控制病变，并且亲自送进县医院治疗，一个星期就好了，只花了二十元钱。“赤脚医生”在贯彻“预防为主”的方针中，也起了巨大的作用。有一个大队的“赤脚医生”，在大队的领导下，与贫下中农一起大搞粪水管理和饮水消毒，使蚊蝇大量减少，有效地预防了流行疾病。仅以流脑、乙脑为例，一九六六年为二百病例，今年几乎没有发生。他们的粪、水管理工作，受到前来公社参观群众卫生状况的人们的赞扬。同时，有了“赤脚医生”，贫下中农在医疗卫生方面更有发言权了。一个贫农病人由“赤脚医生”送到县人民医院就诊，那里的一个世界观没有改造好的医务人员，把一支体温表放在他嘴里一小时零三分还不来取。这位贫农在“赤脚医生”的支持下，当场严厉批判了这种歧视工农的恶劣的医疗作风。
                培养“赤脚医生”的途径
    目前，江镇公社的“赤脚医生”共有二十八人，分布在全公社二十一个大队，他们的平均年龄是二十三岁，绝大部分都是贫下中农子女，只有小学或初中文化程度，有的只念过二年半书。
    这个公社采用两种办法来培养“赤脚医生”：
    一种是公社卫生院集训。这里面有两条路线的激烈斗争。文化大革命前夕，进行了一次完全“三脱离”的训练。当时，把旧医科学校的一套做法搬到了训练班，每天八节课，从书本到书本，大搞“正规化”、“系统化”。关门搞了一番训练，虽然也有一定的作用，但是资产阶级名利思想也侵袭了他们。有人买起了九块钱一本的洋书，在农村中挟进挟出，有的“赤脚医生”不想赤脚了，盼望进城穿起白大衣当“大夫”了。在文化大革命中，贫下中农亲自管理，与公社卫生院结合，由巡回医疗队辅助，举办了抗大式训练班。在为时两个月的训练期间，“赤脚医生”也参加了训练班的领导班子。他们以“老三篇”为基本教材，贫下中农亲自去对他们进行阶级教育；并且紧密结合从实践中提出的问题进行业务教学。训练班结束时，人人表示要做一个全心全意为贫下中农服务的“赤脚医生”。
    另一种是在实践中加以培养。这是培养“赤脚医生”的重要方法。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”“赤脚医生”回到生产大队以后，贫下中农为他们提供了医疗实践的广阔天地。他们说：“我们就是要叫鸡毛飞上天。”在有些大队，小病大病都送给“赤脚医生”治疗。他们每年都有一千五百人次左右的诊治机会。而在这个公社的一个专业医生，在医科学校读了五年，一共只接触了几百个病人。同时，由公社卫生院的“三同医生”（与贫下中农同吃同住同劳动的医生）和“包片医生”（包干二、三个大队医疗工作的医生），或巡回医疗队医务人员的带教，使“赤脚医生”提高得很快。例如有一位“赤脚医生”通过医务人员的带教，已经能够单独对心脏病人进行诊断和施药，有效地控制了病情的发展。
    培养“赤脚医生”，同样存在由那个阶级掌握领导权的问题。工人阶级、贫下中农不去掌握这个领导权，“赤脚医生”是培养不出来、成长不起来的。首先，要选拔好培养对象。在大沟大队，有一个前几年从城市下放的护士，一部分社员考虑请他当“赤脚医生”。但是，他一开始就计较工分、报酬，贫下中农没有选他，而是选了另一个贫农的女儿。这个贫农的女儿，只有高小水平，是队里的会计和保管员，平时公私分明，得到贫下中农的称赞。其次，掌握思想教育也很重要。有一个大队放松了对“赤脚医生”的教育，结果她被资产阶级思想腐蚀，嫁给了一个富农的儿子，垮掉了。而近邻一个大队的“赤脚医生”，家里经常为她进行忆苦会、讲用会，生产大队吸收她参加大队毛泽东思想学习班和中心组学习，使她成长为一个共产党员。文化大革命前，由于反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的统治，一小撮走资派和资产阶级医生百般歧视“赤脚医生”，阻挠他们成长。明明他们早已会用的药物不准用，明明他们早已能开的处方不准开。文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派夺回了公社卫生院的领导权，打破了上述种种条条框框，为“赤脚医生”的成长创造了有利条件。
    江镇公社二十八名“赤脚医生”的业务培训，只有公社卫生院一个城市来的某医专毕业的医生具体负责。几年来，他和广大贫下中农建立了感情，体会到要贯彻执行毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示，不仅要自己身体力行，而且还要把训练“赤脚医生”作为自己的重要任务。他自己编写了大量的简易农村医疗卫生教材，介绍了一些优秀的农村通俗医务书籍，组织“赤脚医生”进行广泛的“兵教兵”活动，着重培养他们自学的能力，使他们在实践中迅速入门。事实说明，入门不难。例如有个没有经过集训的“赤脚医生”，通过自学和“兵教兵”活动，业务能力提高很快，曾单独治好过胸膜炎病人。后来，他参加了一次短训，进步的速度甚至比其他“赤脚医生”还快。这个从城里下到农村的医生证明，从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。不信，请看上海川沙县江镇公社的那个医生。
    在贫下中农教育培养下，“赤脚医生”走的是从贫下中农中来、到贫下中农中去，从农村实践中来、到农村实践中去的道路。
    经过二年多的实践，“赤脚医生”的医疗技术有了显著的提高，他们普遍能使用近一百种药物，诊治近一百种农村的常见病、多发病，针灸行针一百多个穴位，还能够医治麻疹、肺炎、胸膜炎等农村常见重病。有些“赤脚医生”的实际工作能力，胜过了这个公社卫生院里某些从学校出来又没有实践经验的医生。例如：一个自称读了近二十年书的医生，把阑尾炎诊断成普通肠胃炎，结果耽误了病人，恶化成腹膜炎；后来，请来了“赤脚医生”，由他迅速确诊，才避免了生命危险。
    这一点，还能从公社卫生院两位年龄差不多而经历不同的医生的对比中看出：
    一个是主要学习外科和内科的某医专毕业生，死读书五年，一副近视眼镜从三百度升到了六百二十五度。参加工作四年了，但能力很差，连脑膜炎、胸膜炎也诊断不出。一次为一个死胎早产病人接生，临床时，死背在学校里记熟了的书本知识，急得手足无措。对这些人应当进行教育，使他们逐步获得改造。
    另一个医生，贫农出身，只有初二水平，是一九五八年大跃进时的除害防病卫生积极分子，由公社送到县卫生学校学习十个月，后到公社卫生院，工作几年后，又经七个月的外科进修。目前，在医疗设备较差的情况下，能够进行疝修补、绝育等手术。经过文化大革命的锻炼，他已成为公社卫生院革委会的负责人。
    这个鲜明的对比，暴露了旧医学教育制度（整个教育制度）严重脱离政治、脱离实践的弊病，显示出“赤脚医生”这支新型医疗卫生队伍发展的巨大生命力。
    “赤脚医生”在技术上所以进步快，最根本的是由于他们热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义新农村，热爱贫下中农。有一个大部分亲属都在上海市区的“赤脚医生”，近两年没有离开过大队。大队里有一位患瘫痪症的七十多岁的贫农老大娘，大小便常常拉在身上。“赤脚医生”每天都爬到她的床上，帮她打针，换洗衣服。老大娘感动地说：“毛主席他老人家真好！要不然，我老死掉了人家也不知道。这个囡比亲生囡还好！”
    从“赤脚医生”的成长来看
      医学院校的教育革命
    从“赤脚医生”的成长道路，可以看到医学院校的教育革命的一些问题。江镇公社的贫下中农体会到：要贯彻执行毛主席关于“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示，必须搞好医学院校的教育革命。他们学习了毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示，认为：
      （一）医学教育必须为无产阶级政治服务。贫下中农谈起公社里两个同时担任“赤脚医生”的青年：一个后来被保送到嘉定半农半医医专学习（高中毕业才能入学）。这所学校是反革命修正主义分子杨西光抓的重点，向学生灌输了大量修正主义毒素。三年下来，这位“赤脚医生”成了白面书生，平时回家跟贫下中农都不大说话了。她不愿回本公社工作，更不愿回本大队当“赤脚医生”了。另一个只念过两年半书，经过三年的斗争锻炼，提高了政治觉悟。她更加热爱贫下中农，热爱农村医务工作，说：“我药箱里药用少了，比家里米缺了还着急。”在医疗技术上，后者也超过了前者。贫下中农感慨地说：“教育不革命，就算是我伲送去的囡，也要出修正主义！”他们认为，医学教育一定要无产阶级政治挂帅，要把“老三篇”和《实践论》、《矛盾论》作为必修课；要贯彻理论联系实践的原则，学生应该在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中进行学习。
      （二）医学院校的招生对象主要应是“赤脚医生”和卫生员。毛主席最近指出，“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”贫下中农认为，“赤脚医生”在农村里滚上二、三年，再进医学院校学习，这个办法好。贫下中农高兴地说：“以后医学院校招生，我伲要把‘赤脚医生’送去，学几年后再回来为我伲服务。”江镇公社在各生产队选拔了一百四十四名不脱产的卫生员，主要由“赤脚医生”带训。带出来以后，“赤脚医生”多了，就可以抽出一部分人去医学院校学习一、二年或二、三年。
      （三）坚持在普及的基础上提高。贫下中农认为，当前，医学最主要的是普及，也要提高，但必须沿着工农兵所需要的方向去提高。那些为极少数城市老爷太太服务的所谓“提高”，必须彻底批判。贫下中农还认为：“赤脚医生”中除了一部分进入学校学习外，绝大部分都应当坚持扎根农村，可以采用卫生院医生和“赤脚医生”上下定期对调的办法，加以提高。这样做，既有利于原来的医疗卫生队伍的改造，又有利于在实践中提高“赤脚医生”。
