Good news frequently arrives at our village from the Beijing Municipal Tongxian County Agricultural Representative Assembly Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. The commune's loudspeaker broadcasts good tidings: the Revolutionary Committees of Tibet and Xinjiang have been established, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are jubilant. Grandma listens intently, Grandpa walks out with his cane, and under the big locust tree, people gather like a tide. They hold meetings to celebrate and express their resolve. Every word and sentence soars to the clouds: We must closely follow the great strategic deployments, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform, and take the lead in thorough revolution. Grasp the revolution and promote production, with workers and peasants advancing side by side. Closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and let the red mountains and rivers flourish forever.

    红色江山万年春
    北京市通县农代会毛泽东思想宣传队喜讯频频到咱村，公社的喇叭传佳音，西藏、新疆革命委员会成立了，贫下中农齐欢腾。老奶奶听得入了神，老爷爷拄杖出了门，大槐树下人如潮，开会庆祝表决心。声声句句高入云：伟大战略部署要紧跟，认真搞好斗、批、改，彻底革命打头阵。抓革命，促生产，工农并肩向前进，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，红色江山万年春。
