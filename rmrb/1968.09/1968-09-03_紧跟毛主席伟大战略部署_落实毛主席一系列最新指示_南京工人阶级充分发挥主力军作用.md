The working class of Nanjing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully playing the role of the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the fierce class struggle, they advance bravely; in promoting the revolutionary great alliance in Jiangsu and Nanjing, they take the lead; they resolutely support and bravely defend the revolutionary committees; they send a batch of cadres to help with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in organs and schools; industrial production exceeds one month after another. All this has strengthened and developed the great situation in Nanjing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 2nd: The working class of Nanjing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and fully plays the role of the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the fierce class struggle, they advance bravely with practical actions to resolutely support and bravely defend the newly born revolutionary committees, strengthening and developing the great situation in Nanjing.

Currently, revolutionary committees have been established in most grassroots units in Nanjing. The tide of revolutionary criticism has swept every corner; the work of cleaning up the class ranks is both vigorous and solid; industrial production exceeds one month after another, and the market is bustling. The revolutionary and production situation in the whole city is excellent and getting better.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the working class of Nanjing bravely charges forward. They take the lead in promoting the revolutionary great alliance in Jiangsu and Nanjing, playing the leading role of the working class. After the establishment of revolutionary committees in the province, city, and many grassroots units, they regard the consolidation and development of the newly born revolutionary committees as their most important political task. They hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen the unity within the working class, thoroughly expose and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to weaken and split the revolutionary committees, and make new contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Nanjing.

Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and all battle orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the fundamental task of the revolutionary committees. The working class of Nanjing, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, immediately takes action whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters are issued. They remove any interference, fully implement, and seriously carry out, supporting the leadership of the revolutionary committees with practical actions.

In April this year, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The working class of Nanjing immediately took action, launching a fierce attack on a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders who represent the interests of the reactionary Kuomintang. They overcame all difficulties, fought continuously, and did a lot of detailed work, exposing the class enemies who sabotaged the Cultural Revolution. In the past four months, 42 large-scale struggle meetings against the Jiangsu agents of Khrushchev's revisionism, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, were held by the revolutionary mass organizations of the workers in the city, with 577,000 participants. These meetings greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of the class enemies, powerfully promoting the rapid development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the grassroots factories, the broad masses of workers, using Chairman Mao's latest instruction as a powerful ideological weapon, exposed a handful of class enemies who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks through great discussions, great exposures, and great revelations of enemy situations. They uncovered the long-covered lid of class struggle, consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and promoted the in-depth development of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity." The working class of Nanjing, following Chairman Mao's teaching, leads and helps the broad revolutionary masses with their model actions to implement and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. Some organs and schools encountered obstacles in their struggle against the enemy and could not proceed deeply. The working class of the whole city actively supported these units from various aspects, helping them to uncover the lid of class struggle. Recently, under the leadership of the municipal revolutionary committee, the working class has sent a batch of cadres to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, helping these units to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The development and consolidation of the newly born revolutionary committees are a serious class struggle. A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders always sabotage the newly born revolutionary committees from the right or ultra-left. The working class of Nanjing, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle," stands up and resolutely exposes and smashes the evil plots of the class enemies, defending the newly born revolutionary committees.

When a handful of class enemies create incidents, stir up trouble, incite bourgeois factionalism, and disrupt the unity within the revolutionary committees, the working class of Nanjing firmly stands on the proletarian party line, firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, and gives a stern rebuttal and resolute exposure to the enemy's actions of attacking and splitting the revolutionary committees. Through the active struggle of the working class, the evil intentions of a handful of class enemies to split the revolutionary committees are exposed in broad daylight.

When a handful of class enemies use sabotage of production to crush the revolutionary committees, the working class of Nanjing immediately smashes the enemy's plots with the actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Through the efforts of the working class, revolutionary committees have been established in most large factories in the city, and some factories' production has exceeded historical highs. The city's total industrial output in the second quarter increased by 54.5% compared to the first quarter, 7.4% in July compared to June, and August saw further improvements. Market supplies are also getting better.

    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署　落实毛主席一系列最新指示
    南京工人阶级充分发挥主力军作用
    在激烈的阶级斗争大风大浪中勇往直前；在促进江苏、南京地区革命大联合工作中积极带头；坚决支持、勇敢捍卫了革命委员会；派出一批骨干到机关、学校帮助搞好斗批改；工业生产一月超过一月。这一切，有力地巩固和发展了南京市的大好形势。
    据新华社南京二日电　用毛泽东思想武装起来的南京市工人阶级，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，充分发挥在无产阶级文化大革命中的主力军作用，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，以实际行动坚决支持和勇敢捍卫新生的革命委员会，有力地巩固和发展了南京市的大好形势。
    目前，南京市绝大部分基层单位都成立了革命委员会。革命大批判的浪潮遍及每个角落；清理阶级队伍的工作既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实；工业生产一月超过一月，市场一片繁荣。全市革命、生产形势大好，越来越好。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”南京市的工人阶级在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，勇猛冲杀，一往直前。他们在促进江苏、南京地区革命大联合工作中，积极带头，发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。在省、市和许多基层单位成立革命委员会以后，他们又把巩固和发展新生的革命委员会当作自己的一项最重大的政治任务。他们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步加强了工人阶级内部的团结，彻底揭露和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图削弱和分裂革命委员会的阴谋，为南京市的文化大革命作出了新的贡献。
    落实毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，是革命委员会的根本任务。南京市的工人阶级怀着对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，每当毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令一发表，他们就闻风而动，排除任何干扰，全面落实，认真贯彻，以实际行动支持革命委员会的领导。
    今年四月，毛主席发出了最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”南京市的工人阶级立即行动起来，向代表国民党反动派利益的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派发起了猛烈的进攻。他们排除万难，连续苦战，做了大量细致的工作，把破坏文化大革命的阶级敌人揪了出来。四个多月来，由市工人革命群众组织主办的批斗中国赫鲁晓夫在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流的大会达四十二次，参加人数有五十七万七千多人。这些大会，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，有力地促进了无产阶级文化大革命的迅猛发展。在基层工厂，广大工人群众也以毛主席这一最新指示为强大思想武器，通过大议、大摆、大揭敌情，揪出了混进革命队伍的一小撮阶级敌人，揭开了长期被捂着的阶级斗争盖子，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，推动了斗、批、改的深入开展。
    毛主席教导说：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”。南京市的工人阶级，遵照毛主席的这一教导，以自己的模范行动，带动和帮助广大革命群众，贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。有些机关、学校的对敌斗争遇到了阻力，深入不下去，全市工人阶级就主动从多方面给这些单位大力支援，帮助他们揭开阶级斗争盖子。最近，在市革委会的领导下，工人阶级又派出了一批骨干，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助这些单位进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，搞好斗、批、改。
    新生的革命委员会的发展、巩固，是一场严重的阶级斗争。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，总是从右的或极“左”的方面破坏新生的革命委员会。南京市工人阶级遵照毛主席“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，挺身而出，坚决揭露和彻底粉碎阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，保卫了新生的革命委员会。
    当一小撮阶级敌人制造事端，兴风作浪，煽动资产阶级派性，挑拨群众与革命委员会的关系，破坏革委会内部团结的时候，南京市的工人阶级坚决站在无产阶级党性的立场上，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，对阶级敌人攻击、分裂革委会的言行给予严正的批驳和坚决的揭露。通过工人阶级积极的斗争，把一小撮阶级敌人妄图分裂革命委员会的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    当一小撮阶级敌人使用破坏生产来压垮革命委员会的时候，南京市的工人阶级立即用狠抓革命，猛促生产的实际行动来粉碎敌人的阴谋。经过工人阶级的努力，全市多数大型工厂成立了革命委员会，有些工厂的生产超过了历史最高水平。全市第二季度的工业总产值比第一季度增加百分之五十四点五，七月份比六月份增加百分之七点四，八月份又有新的提高。市场供应也越来越好。
