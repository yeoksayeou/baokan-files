On September 8, the revolutionary workers of the Yiqi Workshop at the Lanxiang Factory gathered around the newly developed cutting machine with boundless excitement. They enthusiastically cheered for the success of the silent weld root cutting machine, developed by young worker Wang Yizhong, which was put into production on the joyous day when the entire nation was red. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for the working class in mastering and leading technological power.

Young worker Wang Yizhong stood beside the silent weld root cutting machine, watching the spinning wheels, his heart filled with emotion. He deeply felt that every step forward was guided by Chairman Mao, and every achievement was a crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1958, when Wang Yizhong entered the factory, he stood proudly by the automated lathe on his first day. A poor boy who was once looked down upon in the old society had now become the master of the state. He vowed to contribute all his strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction! When he saw the old workers chipping weld roots, using heavy wind chisels to chip the edges between two steel plates, beads of sweat pouring down, flying iron filings hitting the workers' faces, many comrades injured their faces, many comrades injured their eyes, especially the chipping sound, wailing in the workshop, many people got "occupational diseases." Wang Yizhong thought: If machines could replace manual operations, it would be so much better!

From then on, he began to explore and experiment. He shared his ideas with the so-called technical "authorities" in the factory, but the response he got was: "Such equipment does not exist in the country, and there is no basis for it in scientific and technological literature. You should proceed with caution." Some even obstructed him technically and restricted him in terms of materials, forcing him to pack up. Thus, his innovation proposal was shelved. Wang Yizhong, however, did not give up. He studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We can learn things we did not know before. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Chairman Mao's words gave him the courage to overcome the bourgeois technical "authorities." He thought: We, the working class, are an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the most selfless and bravest class in the world. All the wealth in the world is created by the laboring people. Why should we be intimidated by the bourgeois lords? With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to break the bourgeois shackles and dogmas, and follow the self-reliant path indicated by Chairman Mao. His contempt for the bourgeois technical "authorities" and his limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao gave Wang Yizhong boundless strength. He began to study more seriously. In the process of research, difficulties followed one after another, but he overcame them all with the strength from Chairman Mao's works. He encouraged himself: Achieve results and bring down the arrogance of the bourgeois lords. Even after he was injured in his right eye due to the experiment and was hospitalized, he continued to study Chairman Mao's works and carried on with his research.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution surged forward, and the revolutionary committee was established in the factory. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee and with the help of the three-in-one technical guidance group in the workshop, Wang Yizhong quickly broke through the difficulties. After twenty-one experiments, he finally successfully developed the silent weld root cutting machine, increasing work efficiency by six times and saving the country more than a thousand yuan each month.

The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of technological revolution. The working class has become the master of the scientific and technological stage. Wang Yizhong is determined to follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao, to scale new heights in science and technology, and to make more and greater contributions to the Party and the people.

    科学技术舞台上的主人
    九月八日，兰石厂装乙工段的革命职工，怀着无限激动的心情，围在刚试制成功的切削机旁，热烈欢呼在全国山河一片红的大喜日子里，由青年工人王义忠试制成功的无声焊根切削机投入生产。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是工人阶级掌握技术领导大权的一个胜利。
    青年工人王义忠，站在无声焊根切削机旁，看着飞转的车轮，心情非常激动，他深深体会到：每前进一步都是毛主席的指引，每一点成就都是毛泽东思想的结晶。
    一九五八年，王义忠进厂时，他第一天站在自动化的车床旁，多么自豪！一个在旧社会被人看不起的穷孩子，今天成了国家的主人，他立志要为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献出自己全部的力量！当他看见老工人挖焊根时，拿着笨重的风铲，铲着两块钢板间的棱线，豆大的汗珠不停地往下淌，飞溅的铁屑，打在工人的脸上，有多少阶级兄弟被打伤了脸，有多少阶级兄弟被刺伤了眼，尤其是铲铁声，在车房里呜呜地响，不少人得了“职业病”。王义忠心想：如果能用机器代替手工操作该有多好！
    从此以后，他着手摸索和试验。他把自己的想法告诉厂里的所谓技术“权威”，得到的回答是：“这种设备在全国没有，在科学技术的资料上也找不到根据，你要慎重行事。”有的甚至在技术上进行刁难，在材料上进行限制，迫使他收拾摊子。就这样，他的革新建议被打入冷宫。王义忠并不因此罢休。他学习了毛主席的教导：“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。毛主席的话给了他战胜资产阶级技术“权威”的勇气。他想：我们工人阶级是用毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，是世界上最无私、最勇敢的阶级，世界上的一切财富都是我们劳动人民创造的，为什么要被资产阶级老爷给吓住呢？有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就什么都不怕。我们要用毛泽东思想破除资产阶级的洋框框、洋教条，走毛主席指引的自力更生的道路。对资产阶级技术“权威”的蔑视，对毛主席的无限忠心，使王义忠具有无穷的力量，他又开始更加认真地研究。在研究中，困难一个接着一个，他都从毛主席著作中得到力量解决了。他鼓励自己：做出成绩来，把资产阶级老爷们的威风打下去。当他因为搞试验被刺伤右眼进了医院以后，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作，继续进行研究工作。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，工厂里的革命委员会成立了，在厂革委会的领导下，在工段三结合技术指导小组的帮助下，王义忠迅速地突破了难关，经过二十一次试验，终于试制成功了无声焊根切削机，使工效提高了六倍，每月为国家节约一千多元。
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照亮了技术革命的道路，工人阶级成了科学技术舞台的主人，王义忠决心沿着毛主席指引的革命航向，攀登新的更高的科学技术高峰，为党为人民做出更多更新的贡献。
