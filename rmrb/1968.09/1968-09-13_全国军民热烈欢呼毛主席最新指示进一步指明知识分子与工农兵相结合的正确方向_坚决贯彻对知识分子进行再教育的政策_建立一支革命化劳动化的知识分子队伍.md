The entire nation's military and civilians warmly celebrate Chairman Mao's latest directive, which further clarifies the correct path for intellectuals to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They resolutely implement the policy of re-educating intellectuals and strive to build a revolutionary and labor-oriented intellectual contingent.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th: "Students from old-style schools, the majority or a large majority of them, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have even made inventions and innovations. However, they must be under the correct leadership and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old thinking. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." After this latest directive from Chairman Mao was broadcast last night, it greatly encouraged the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary intellectuals nationwide. Last night and today, thousands and millions of people beat drums and gongs, marched in the streets, and warmly celebrated the great leader Chairman Mao's new tasks and directions for us as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens into the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation. People repeatedly shouted, "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

People across the country, linking the important editorial note published in the September 5th issue of the *Red Flag* magazine with Chairman Mao's latest directive and the editorial article in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine titled "On the Issue of Re-educating Intellectuals," unanimously pointed out that having the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers re-educate intellectuals and guiding them to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers is of great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must implement Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies, help revolutionary intellectuals and those who can be reformed to seriously reform their worldviews, and make great strides forward on the path of revolutionization and laborization to quickly build a proletarian intellectual contingent.

In cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and the revolutionary committee locations of various provinces and autonomous regions, including Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Nanning, Nanjing, Jinan, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Hefei, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Urumqi, Yinchuan, and Xining, the broad revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army soldiers have been immersed in a joyous atmosphere since last night. The sound of firecrackers, drums, and gongs, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the night. Many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region revolutionary committees, as well as grassroots revolutionary committees in factories, schools, and government agencies, held emergency meetings last night to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directive. Many cities' printing workers worked through the night to print the latest directive and distribute it to the revolutionary masses. Some cities' revolutionary cultural workers composed songs about Chairman Mao's latest directive and performed them in the streets. Various means were used to quickly transmit Chairman Mao's latest directive to remote rural areas, islands, and mountainous regions.

Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants across the country, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive and the important editorial note in the September 5th issue of the *Red Flag* magazine, as well as the editorial article in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine titled "On the Issue of Re-educating Intellectuals," were particularly moved. They said, Chairman Mao's latest directive not only further clarifies the correct path for intellectuals to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers but also gives us a glorious mission. Chairman Mao entrusts the task of re-educating intellectuals to workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the greatest encouragement and support for us. We must genuinely implement Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies regarding intellectuals and fulfill the great historical mission entrusted by the great leader Chairman Mao to "pay attention to re-educating the large number of graduates from colleges and universities who have been working for some time and are currently working."

Old workers from Hangzhou Automobile Engine Factory and Shenyang Smelting Plant said that during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many technical personnel in their factories began to change their old ways of thinking and working, which were detached from reality and labor. They worked alongside workers, conducted experiments together, and achieved new results in technological innovation. This shows that the majority or a large majority of intellectuals are willing to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary workers from Jiaozuo Mining Machinery Factory in Henan said that students educated in old-style schools, as long as they adhere to the path guided by Chairman Mao and are willing to unite with us workers and peasants, are welcomed by us. A small handful of class enemies attempt to sow discord between intellectuals and workers, peasants, and soldiers and obstruct intellectuals from uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must resolutely smash the class enemies' plot.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, who are marching into schools to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and the important editorial note in the *Red Flag* magazine, as well as the editorial article in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine. They immediately summarized their work. They said, the working class entering the cultural and educational front, the main objects of work are intellectuals. Only by adhering to the leadership of the working class and correctly grasping the party's policies toward intellectuals can we achieve victory in the struggle. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams who entered Beijing's Tsinghua University, Shanghai's Fudan University, Tianjin Institute of Technology, Harbin Normal University, Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Medical College, Wuhan Institute of Iron and Steel, Zhengzhou Institute of Technology, Xi'an Northwest Agricultural College, Shandong Institute of Technology, Jiangxi Medical College, Hefei University of Technology, Qinghai Nationalities Institute, Lanzhou University, and other colleges and universities all pointed out that the most important task for the working class to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools is to bring Chairman Mao's latest directive and the various policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin into the schools. Revolutionary youths and Red Guards, who have made great achievements in the initial and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, have made some mistakes. We have the responsibility to help them correct their mistakes. We must protect the Red Guards well, help them, and educate them. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered these schools, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes" and quickly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, rapidly raising the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools. The workers' propaganda team members, linking these facts, excitedly said, the facts have proven that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously implement the party's policies toward intellectuals, and fully develop positive factors, we will definitely promote the broad intellectuals who are willing to accept reform under the leadership of the working class and unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers to make rapid progress on the path of revolutionization and laborization.

Poor and lower-middle peasants across the country, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, warmly welcomed revolutionary intellectuals to the countryside. Guo Zhengyuan, the commander of the Sixth Platoon of the Red Flag Militia Camp in Guozhuang, Wuxi County, Hebei Province, said: Chairman Mao's words touched our hearts. Our brigade has had more than fifty returned educated youths since 1958. After being re-educated by the poor and lower-middle peasants, most of them put down their airs and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp class struggle, carry out technological revolution, achieve results, and were welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. He Shunming, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Maqiao People's Commune, Shanghai County, and Yu Fuzhen, the women's director of Shiyue People's Commune, Nanjing, both said that poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcome revolutionary intellectuals to the countryside. They gave examples, saying that intellectuals who come to the countryside, as long as they follow Chairman Mao's teachings and unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, will definitely make rapid progress on the path of revolutionization and laborization and make contributions in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

Chairman Mao teaches: "All the knowledge youths and student youths in the country must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and become one with them." Following this great teaching, revolutionary intellectuals who have taken the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers deeply felt from their own practice that it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that helped them overcome bourgeois individualism, and it is the broad masses of workers and peasants who helped them strengthen their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and taught them various labor skills. After Beijing intellectual youth Cai Lijian and others settled in a remote village in Yuxian County, Shanxi Province, they were warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and received more than five hundred encouraging letters from various places. Cai Lijian excitedly said: Half a year of practice has made us deeply feel that the broad masses of workers and peasants warmly welcome intellectuals uniting with them and warmly give us re-education. We will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's teachings and the expectations of the broad masses of workers and peasants. We will definitely accept the re-education of workers and peasants, reform our worldviews, and become good successors of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. Li Kehong, a technical staff member of Shijiazhuang Coal Mining Machinery Factory and a university graduate, said with deep feelings: In the past, I did not unite with workers but only stayed in the house to look up documents, do designs, and rack my brains, resulting in nothing. The commentary on the investigation report of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory conveyed Chairman Mao's latest directive, which promoted my unity with workers, and in a short time, I and the workers jointly developed a new product. This practice made me clearly see that the path guided by Chairman Mao to unite with workers and peasants is a bright path, and I will definitely follow it. Dan Kunrong, deputy director of the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee and a high school student who settled in the countryside in 1961, said, after several years of labor, I have achieved some results in reforming my thoughts, which is all thanks to the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, I will strictly demand of myself, and even if I am busy with work, I will participate in labor and carry out the revolution to the end with the poor and lower-middle peasants!

Revolutionary teachers and students from various colleges and universities across the country, as well as many intellectuals who have been working for some time and are currently working, compared themselves with Chairman Mao's latest directive and reviewed their past suffering from the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi. They deeply felt the lack of thoroughness and wavering in their revolution. Only under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, accepting the leadership of the working class, and asking workers and peasants to re-educate them can they be thoroughly reformed. Revolutionary teachers and students from Tsinghua University, in the evening discussion held last night, angrily denounced the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They said, Chairman Mao has shown us the way out, and we will definitely follow the path guided by Chairman Mao to "unite with the masses and serve the masses" and go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to strive for self-reform and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary teachers and students from Sun Yat-sen Medical College in Guangdong said, Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a spring thunder, making us clear-sighted. We are determined to receive re-education from workers and peasants for life and serve workers and peasants for life. In the countryside, we will be a doctor welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Revolutionary teachers and students from Renhuai County No. 1 Middle School in Guizhou, where Chairman Mao led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the Long March, immediately studied and discussed after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive on the radio, and they enthusiastically expressed their loyalty to Chairman Mao, made pledges, wrote applications, and urgently requested to receive re-education from workers and peasants.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, in various meetings celebrating the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on re-educating intellectuals, pointed out that using Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals is a sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for intellectuals. In the new upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation across the country, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies toward intellectuals is of great importance for ensuring victory in the struggle. The broad masses of soldiers and officers expressed their determination to be the firm backbone of the working class. They will enthusiastically help intellectuals reform their worldviews with Mao Zedong Thought, making them firmly take the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The new and old intellectuals in the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, various military branches, and the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, in studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest directive, exchanged their personal experiences. They all felt that the broad masses of workers and peasants warmly welcome intellectuals who are willing to unite with workers and peasants. They expressed their determination to continue to advance in the direction guided by the great leader Chairman Mao. Jiang Hongmo, secretary of the Hubei Provincial Military Region, graduated from university and joined the army. He learned the noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly from the soldiers, making himself an active element in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. He said, workers and peasants study and apply Mao Zedong Thought best, and workers and peasants' education of intellectuals is the most practical and specific. Intellectuals can only truly change their stand, thoughts, and feelings and thoroughly reform their worldviews by uniting with workers and peasants and accepting their re-education. In recent years, a large number of young intellectuals assigned to work in the People's Liberation Army, in the discussion meeting, angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line's poisoning of them and enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao's enlightened teachings and the cultivation of the People's Liberation Army. Wu Jiangliang, a representative attending the National Defense Industry Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, is a graduate of Tsinghua University. He said, when entering Tsinghua Garden, he saw the big banner "Welcome to the cradle of engineers." But after being "shaken" for six years, he still knew nothing. It was the bright path of uniting with workers and peasants guided by Chairman Mao that made him a person beneficial to the people, and it was the great school of the People's Liberation Army that made his heart red. He deeply felt that only by accepting the re-education of workers and peasants can one truly become a new person of the Mao Zedong era.

    全国军民热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示进一步指明知识分子与工农兵相结合的正确方向
    坚决贯彻对知识分子进行再教育的政策  建立一支革命化劳动化的知识分子队伍
    据新华社十二日讯　“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的这一最新指示昨晚广播以后，极大地鼓舞了全国广大工农兵和革命的知识分子。昨夜和今天，千千万万的人敲锣打鼓，上街游行，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展到斗、批、改阶段，为我们提出了新任务，指明了前进的方向。人们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    各地广大工农兵联系九月五日报上发表的《红旗》杂志重要编者按提出的对知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，认真学习毛主席的最新指示以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志评论员文章：《关于知识分子再教育问题》，一致指出，由广大工农兵对知识分子进行再教育，使知识分子走与工农兵相结合的道路，这对夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利有着极其重大的意义。我们一定要贯彻执行毛主席规定的各项无产阶级政策，帮助广大革命的和有可能改造的知识分子认真改造世界观，在革命化、劳动化的道路上大踏步前进，迅速地建立起一支无产阶级知识分子队伍。
    北京、上海、天津和各省、自治区革命委员会所在地沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、太原、石家庄、呼和浩特、郑州、武汉、长沙、广州、南宁、南京、济南、南昌、杭州、合肥、福州、成都、昆明、贵阳、拉萨、兰州、西安、乌鲁木齐、银川、西宁等城市的广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员，从昨晚起一直浸沉在欢乐的气氛中。鞭炮声、锣鼓声，“毛主席万岁，万万岁”的欢呼声，震天动地，彻夜不息。许多省、市、自治区革命委员会或工厂、学校、机关的基层革命委员会，连夜召开紧急会议，学习座谈毛主席的最新指示。不少城市的印刷工人，连夜赶印最新指示向革命群众散发，有些城市的革命文艺工作者连夜把毛主席的最新指示谱成歌曲，上街宣传。各地还利用各种途径，以最快的速度把毛主席的最新指示传达到边远的农村、海岛和山区。
    各地广大工人、贫下中农学习了毛主席的最新指示和九月五日报上发表的《红旗》杂志极其重要的编者按，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志评论员文章《关于知识分子再教育问题》，心情特别激动。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，不仅为知识分子进一步指明了与工农兵相结合的唯一正确的方向，而且也给我们提出了光荣任务。毛主席把对知识分子再教育的任务交给工农兵，这是对我们的最大鼓舞，最大支持。我们一定要切实贯彻毛主席制定的关于知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给的“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育”的伟大历史使命。杭州汽车发动机厂和沈阳冶炼厂的许多老工人说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们厂有许多技术人员开始改变过去那种脱离实际、脱离劳动的旧思想旧作风，和工人一起劳动，一起试验，在技术革新方面作出了新成绩。这说明多数或大多数知识分子是愿意同工农兵相结合的。河南焦作矿山机械厂的革命工人说，从旧学校中培养出来的学生，只要坚持走毛主席指引的道路，愿意和我们工农兵相结合，我们是欢迎的。一小撮阶级敌人妄图挑拨知识分子和工农兵的关系，妄图阻止知识分子走与工农兵相结合的道路。我们必须坚决粉碎阶级敌人的这一阴谋。
    在毛主席最新指示指引下浩浩荡荡开进学校领导斗、批、改的各地工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员，学习了毛主席的最新指示和《红旗》杂志重要编者按以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志评论员文章，立即对照总结自己的工作。他们说，工人阶级进入文化教育阵地，工作对象主要是知识分子。只有坚持工人阶级领导，正确掌握党对知识分子的政策，才能取得斗争的胜利。进驻北京清华大学、上海复旦大学、天津工学院、哈尔滨师范学院、广州中山医学院、武汉钢铁学院、郑州工学院、西安西北农学院、山东工学院、江西医学院、合肥工业大学、青海民族学院、兰州大学等大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员都指出，工人阶级领导学校斗、批、改，最重要的任务，就是要把毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项政策带进学校。广大革命的青年和红卫兵小将在文化大革命运动的初期和中期，都建立了丰功伟绩，少数小将犯了这样那样的错误，我们有责任帮助他们改正。我们一定要好好地保护红卫兵小将，要帮助他们，教育他们。这些学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校以后，遵照毛主席的“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班，迅速提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动了学校里的斗、批、改。工人宣传队队员联系这些事实激动地说，事实证明，只要我们遵照毛主席的教导，认真贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，充分发扬积极因素，就一定会促使广大愿意在工人阶级领导下接受改造、愿意同工农兵结合的知识分子，在革命化、劳动化的道路上迅速前进。
    各地贫下中农学习了毛主席的最新指示，表示热烈欢迎革命的知识分子到农村去。河北省无极县郭庄红旗民兵营第六连连长郭振娟说：毛主席的话说到我们心坎里。我们大队从一九五八年以后，回乡知识青年五十多人，经过贫下中农再教育，大多数放下了架子，能和贫下中农一起，狠抓阶级斗争，大搞技术革命，取得了成绩，受到了贫下中农欢迎。上海县马桥人民公社革委会委员何顺明、南京十月人民公社十月大队妇女主任余福珍都说，贫下中农非常欢迎革命的知识分子到农村来。他们举例说，知识分子到了农村，只要按照毛主席的教导去做，和贫下中农相结合，就一定能够在革命化、劳动化的道路上迅速前进；就一定会在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中作出贡献。
    毛主席教导说：“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体”，遵照这一伟大教导，走上与工农兵相结合的道路的广大革命知识分子，从自己的实践中深深体会到，是伟大的毛泽东思想使他们战胜了资产阶级个人主义，是广大工农兵帮助他们增强了无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情，教会了他们各种劳动的本领。北京知识青年蔡立坚等人到山西榆次县的偏僻山庄安家落户以后，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎，接到了各地工农兵寄来的五百多封鼓励的信。蔡立坚兴奋地说：半年来的实践，使我们深深感到，广大工农兵是热情欢迎知识分子同他们相结合的，是热情给我们以再教育的。我们决不辜负毛主席的教导，决不辜负广大工农兵的期望，一定要认真接受工农兵的再教育，改造世界观，做工人阶级、贫下中农的好后代。石家庄煤矿机械厂技术员、大学毕业生李克洪深有体会地说：我过去不和工人结合，只是坐在屋子里查文献，搞设计，苦思冥想，结果一事无成。上海机床厂调查报告的按语，传达了毛主席的最新指示，推动了我同工人相结合，在短短的时间里，我和工人一起试制成了一种新产品。这一段实践，使我清楚地看到，毛主席指引的和工农兵结合的道路，是一条光明大道，我要坚决地走下去。四川省革委会副主任、一九六一年到农村落户的高中学生但坤蓉说，经过几年的劳动，我在改造思想方面取得了一些成绩，这都归功于毛主席的革命路线的指引和贫下中农的帮助。学习了毛主席的最新指示，我更要严格要求自己，工作再忙，也要参加劳动，同贫下中农一起把革命进行到底！
    各地高等及中等学校的广大革命师生，以及许多早已从事工作及现正从事工作的知识分子，对照毛主席的最新指示，回顾自己过去受中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，痛切地感到自己身上存在的革命不彻底性和动摇性，只有在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，接受工人阶级的领导，请工农兵给自己以再教育，才能得到彻底改造。清华大学革命师生在昨天晚上召开的座谈会上，愤怒控诉了反革命修正主义教育路线对他们的毒害。他们说，毛主席给我们指明了出路，我们一定走毛主席指引的“知识分子要和群众结合，要为群众服务”的道路，到工农兵中间去，努力改造自己，全心全意为工农兵服务。广东中山医学院的革命师生说，毛主席的最新指示，象一声春雷，使我们心明眼亮，我们决心一辈子受工农兵的再教育，一辈子为工农兵服务，在农村要做一个受贫下中农欢迎的医生。毛主席当年率领中国工农红军长征经过的贵州仁怀县一中的革命师生，从广播中听到毛主席的最新指示后，立即学习讨论，纷纷向毛主席献忠心，表决心，写申请，迫切要求接受工农兵的再教育。
    人民解放军陆、海、空军广大指战员在热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子再教育的最新指示发表的各种集会上，纷纷指出，用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺知识分子的尖锐斗争。在全国范围内掀起斗、批、改的新高潮中，认真贯彻执行毛主席规定的对知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，对于保证斗争胜利，具有十分重要的意义。广大指战员表示，一定要做工人阶级的坚强后盾。用毛泽东思想热情帮助知识分子改造世界观，使他们坚定地走同工农兵相结合的道路。解放军各总部、各军种兵种领导机关和国防科委的新老知识分子在学习、座谈毛主席最新指示时，交流了亲身的体会，他们共同感到：广大工农兵非常欢迎愿意同工农兵相结合的知识分子。他们表示，我们一定要按伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向继续前进。湖北省军区秘书姜宏模，大学毕业后当兵，从战士身上学习完全、彻底为人民服务的高贵品质，使自己锻炼成了活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。他说，工农兵活学活用毛泽东思想最好，工农兵对知识分子的教育最实际、最具体。知识分子只有同工农兵相结合，接受工农兵的再教育，才能真正变立场、变思想、变感情，彻底改造世界观。最近几年分配在人民解放军工作的大批青年知识分子，在座谈会上，愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线对他们的毒害，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的英明教导和解放军对他们的培养。出席国防工业毛泽东思想学习班的代表吴刚良，是清华大学的毕业生。他说，进清华园时看到的是“欢迎你们到了工程师的摇篮”的大标语。可是“摇”了六年，却一窍不通。是毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的光辉道路才使我成为有益于人民的人，是解放军这所大学校炼红了我的心。我深深体会到，只有接受工农兵的再教育，才能真正成为毛泽东时代的新人。
