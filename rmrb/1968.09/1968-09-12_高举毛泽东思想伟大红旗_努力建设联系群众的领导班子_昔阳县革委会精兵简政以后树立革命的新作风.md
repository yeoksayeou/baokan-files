The former county revolutionary committee, after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, has established a new revolutionary style.

The revolutionary committees have implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. In the face of fewer personnel and heavier tasks, how can they better complete their tasks? The experience of the former county revolutionary committee in Shanxi Province is to firmly grasp the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the cadres. By revolutionizing the style of work, they ensure the consolidation and development of the revolutionization of the organization, gradually building a revolutionary leadership team that connects with the masses.

After the former county revolutionary committee was established in April last year, it held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and earnestly implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "This time, streamlining and reducing bureaucracy must be strict, thorough, and universal, not perfunctory, half-hearted, or partial. In this round of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucracy must be achieved." They continuously summarized experiences, continuously identified gaps, and carried out three rounds of streamlining. The first round was when the county revolutionary committee was just established. They broke away from the old, overlapping administrative structures and established a new set of organizations. The second round was in April this year. They implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break away from overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and build a revolutionary leadership team that connects with the masses." They further reduced the organizations and personnel. The third round was after the experience of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy in the former county revolutionary committee was published. They compared themselves with the former county and identified gaps, breaking away from old frameworks and conservative thoughts, and resolutely reduced the organizations and personnel. Now, compared to the former county committee and county people's committee, the number of personnel in the former county revolutionary committee has been reduced by three-quarters. The streamlined personnel, after studying in Mao Zedong Thought classes, happily took up new posts. Now, 121 cadres have been assigned to work in all 20 communes in the county, strengthening the leadership at the grassroots level. At the same time, 60 cadres responded to Chairman Mao's call in the "May 7th Directive" to go to the mountains and countryside, relying on their own hands to manage three fields (forestry, livestock, and agriculture).

The key lies in thoroughly transforming the style of work

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, a prominent issue facing the new organizations is whether to take the new path or the old path? Whether to stay in the office or go out to connect with the masses? After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, a few people in the former county revolutionary committee had the thought of "few people, many tasks, hard to do" and believed they could only stay in the office. Some said: "A good wall can't block the wind from all four directions, and a good general can't block the soldiers from all four directions. In the future, it would be good enough to guard the stall." Most comrades believed that after streamlining the organizations, there were fewer people and more tasks, making the work somewhat difficult. However, we cannot be intimidated by difficulties but must continuously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize, resolutely taking the revolutionary path and the path of connecting with the masses.

In response to these two thoughts, the former county revolutionary committee guided everyone to summarize the lessons from the past streamlining of organizations. Everyone realized that before the Cultural Revolution, there had been multiple rounds of reducing personnel and merging organizations, but soon, new stalls were set up, and more people were added, making the organizations larger and the personnel more numerous. Why? The reasons were multifaceted, but one important reason was that after reducing personnel and merging organizations, there was no continuous revolution, no firm grasp of the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the people, and the style of work was not thoroughly transformed, thus returning to the old path. As the masses criticized: "New stalls, old ways, still walking the old paths." After summarizing the past lessons, the former county revolutionary committee, on the one hand, organized the organ cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings on improving leadership style, and on the other hand, organized everyone to further criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, making the cadres clearly understand the importance of thoroughly transforming the style of work and firmly grasping the revolutionization of the organs. Everyone believed: The revolutionary committee is an organ of proletarian power, and its style must adapt to the needs of the revolution. If the old style that adapts to the needs of revisionism is not thoroughly changed, it cannot well serve the revolution, and it may even produce new revisionist sprouts. The personnel of the revolutionary committee, if they cannot eliminate the old style and establish a new style, they cannot be close to the masses and cannot be good servants of the people. After studying and discussing, the awareness of the cadres to firmly grasp the revolutionization of the organs was greatly enhanced. The former county revolutionary committee thus made a decision in December last year to earnestly transform the style of work, and the standing committee discussed and revised it during the celebration of the first anniversary of the revolutionary committee. The revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the personnel are being carried out more deeply.

Firmly taking the revolutionary path

After streamlining the organizations, how did the former county revolutionary committee firmly grasp the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the personnel?

Fully mobilize revolutionary enthusiasm, with one person doing the work of several. Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructs us: "We are building socialism, we want to be fast, good, and economical, we want high speed. Tension means to be fast, good, and economical, to fully mobilize enthusiasm, to be decisive and swift. ... Without enthusiasm, it won't work. We need enthusiasm, to be decisive and swift, to race against time." The former county revolutionary committee, in grasping the revolutionization of the organs, prominently grasped the enthusiasm of the people, and first grasped the thoughts. They held Mao Zedong Thought classes in the organs, organizing the cadres to use the brilliant "Three Articles" as weapons, and using the three heroic figures of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Fool as examples, to carry out self-criticism and criticize revisionism, transforming their worldview. To solve the thought of "few people, many tasks, hard to do," they organized the members and personnel of the revolutionary committee to visit and learn from the heroic Dazhai Brigade multiple times, comparing with the Dazhai villagers and Dazhai cadres. Everyone realized: "Steel is hard, iron is hard, but the Dazhai people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are harder than steel and iron. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have boundless enthusiasm and inexhaustible strength, and can overcome any difficulty." Why can the Dazhai villagers work for the revolution, with one person doing the work of several, but we, the organ personnel, working for the revolution, cannot do the work of several people with one person? Through self-examination, identifying gaps, mobilizing enthusiasm, the revolutionary spirit of the personnel of the revolutionary committee was greatly inspired, and they voluntarily took on heavy responsibilities, with one person doing the work that several people used to do, completing in one day the tasks that used to take several days.

Prominently grasp proletarian politics, using enthusiasm to firmly grasp the fundamentals. After the revolutionary enthusiasm of the personnel of the revolutionary committee was mobilized, they faced the problem of what to do and how to do it. Some, influenced by old habits, had great enthusiasm but could not break away from the old frameworks, resulting in busy but aimless work, eventually falling into the pit of bureaucratism. County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Chen Yonggui strongly opposed this style of busy but aimless work. He said: "No matter how busy, if proletarian politics are not prominent, it is aimless busyness." Based on the path Dazhai has taken for more than a decade, after participating in the work of the county revolutionary committee, he proposed: "We, with one person doing the work of several, should do it in holding high one red banner, firmly grasping one line, and building one team, achieving 'three non-separations.'" Under the leadership of Comrade Chen Yonggui, the former county revolutionary committee always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the line of class struggle, and strove to build a revolutionary leadership team that connects with the masses. The members of the revolutionary committee achieved "three non-separations": not separating from labor, not separating from the masses, and not separating from hardship. Thus, with the revolutionary enthusiasm of one person doing the work of several, and the method of work that grasps the fundamentals among countless tasks, the former county revolutionary committee gradually cultivated a style of work that is decisive and swift and prominent in proletarian politics. They handle matters without hesitation, doing what they say, and not delaying what should not be delayed overnight. Since the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they implement them in the morning if issued in the morning, at noon if issued at noon, and immediately if issued in the evening. They always timely, comprehensively, and accurately implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, turning them into the conscious actions of the masses.

Leaders participate in specific work, leading by example and working hard. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not here to be officials, but to revolutionize." The former county revolutionary committee, to break away from the old style of the old organizations where "there are many leaders, many who talk, and few who work," not only reduced the number of leaders during the streamlining of organizations but also required the leaders to participate in specific work and lead by example. The seven non-full-time vice chairmen and standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee, except for Vice Chairman Li Hanzu who is responsible for overall work, the other six all take on specific work in various groups, serving as both leaders and ordinary personnel of the revolutionary committee. The leaders and ordinary personnel work together, discuss work together, and solve problems together, with work going straight to the bottom. General issues are researched and handled by the personnel of each group, changing the past situation where big and small issues were all reported for approval, and the leaders decided. Issues that can be solved by a group are not handed up, and matters that can be handled by this group are not pushed to another group. When the masses come to the revolutionary committee to handle matters, except for some major issues that need to be collectively researched and solved by the revolutionary committee, most matters can be handled as they arrive.

Insist on going down to the grassroots, discovering and solving problems on the front line. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic tasks of the leading organs of the Communist Party are to understand the situation and grasp policies in these two major areas." "To solve the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, to do a good job of the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves, to insist on the mass line, to consult with the masses on everything, and to be students of the masses." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the leading cadres of the former county revolutionary committee often take the lead in going down to the front line, setting up teams, squatting in points, dividing areas, and regularly meeting. Local issues are solved on the spot, and general issues are collected and solved on a larger scale. In this way, many issues are solved on the spot. The grassroots cadres and the broad masses of community members are satisfied and say: "In the past, leaders were hard to find, now they are face to face. Issues and work can be discussed and handled at the field, dining hall, roadside, and doorstep."

Leaders lead teams to rotate working in production teams as community members, strengthening the flesh-and-blood connection with the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must not separate from the masses, must not stand above the masses, acting as officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, deeply integrating with the masses, and becoming one with the masses." The former county revolutionary committee, in response to the past situation where some county cadres went down to the countryside, talked more and did less, educated others more and transformed themselves less, did not truly understand the hardships of the community members, and did not truly become one with the masses, made a decision in April this year: Leaders lead teams to rotate working in production teams as community members, for half a month or a month each time. Now, three batches of cadres have already worked in production teams as community members. During their time as community members, they sweated and rolled in the mud like the community members, and their class feelings with the laboring people were greatly deepened. After returning to the revolutionary committee, they always think of the masses in their hearts and rely on the masses in their work, truly representing the interests of the masses, and firmly leading the masses forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Insist on half a day of labor and half a day of work. The members and personnel of the former county revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching: "It is necessary to insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. ... This is a major fundamental issue in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism," except when they go down to the countryside and participate in labor wherever they go, they also insist on laboring in the morning and working in the office in the afternoon and evening when they stay in the organs. They learn from Dazhai's spirit of self-reliance, taking the initiative to establish a labor base and creating wealth for socialism. In a few months, the faces of the cadres of the revolutionary committee have tanned, calluses have formed on their hands, and their hearts serving the people have become redder. They deeply feel: "Only by firmly holding the hoe can one well hold the seal of power for the people."

After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the former county revolutionary committee firmly grasped the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the personnel, establishing a new revolutionary style. They led the 180,000 people of the county to closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, achieving outstanding results. The broad masses praise: "The comrades in the revolutionary committee are indeed our good managers. Handing over the power to them, we are one hundred times at ease!"

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　努力建设联系群众的领导班子
    昔阳县革委会精兵简政以后树立革命的新作风
    他们做到了不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，不脱离艰苦生活；办事雷厉风行，说干就干，不该过夜的从不过夜。在抓革命，促生产中做出了突出的成绩，广大群众赞扬他们是“好当家”
    本报讯　革命委员会实行精兵简政以后，在人员少、任务重的情况下，怎样才能更好地完成任务？山西省昔阳县革命委员会的经验是：狠抓机关革命化和工作人员的思想革命化。用思想作风的革命化，保证组织革命化的巩固和发展，逐步“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。
    昔阳县革委会在去年四月建立以后，就高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真实行精兵简政。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“这一次精兵简政，必须是严格的、彻底的、普遍的，而不是敷衍的、不痛不痒的、局部的。在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”这一教导，不断总结经验，不断找差距，先后进行了三次精简。第一次是在县革委会刚成立的时候，他们打破旧的重叠的行政机构，建立了一套新的机构。第二次是在今年四月份，他们落实毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，又进一步缩小了机构，减少了人员。第三次是在灵宝县革委会精兵简政的经验发表以后，他们比灵宝，看自己，大找差距，大破旧框框和保守思想，又坚决地压缩了机构，减少了人员。现在，昔阳县革委会的机构同原县委、县人委比较，工作人员已减少了四分之三。精简下来的人员，经过在毛泽东思想学习班学习，纷纷愉快地走上新的工作岗位。现在，已有一百二十一名干部被分配到全县二十个公社工作，充实了基层的领导。同时，有六十名干部响应毛主席“五·七”指示的伟大号召，上山下乡，靠双手去办三场（林场、牧场、农场）。
    关键在于彻底转变思想作风
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”精兵简政以后，摆在新机构面前的一个突出的问题，是走新路，还是走老路？是坐办公室守摊，还是走出大门联系群众？昔阳县革委会精兵简政以后，少数人存在着“人少事多难干”的思想，认为只能守摊。有的说：“好墙难堵四面风，好将难挡四面兵，今后守好摊摊就不错。”多数同志认为，机构精简以后，人少事多，工作是有一定困难。但是，我们不能被困难吓倒，而是要不断革命，彻底革命，坚决走革命化的路子，走联系群众的路子。
    针对这两种思想，昔阳县革委会引导大家总结了过去精简机构的教训。大家认识到，在文化大革命以前，也曾多次减人并机构，可是过不了多久，这里又设摊，那里又添人，机构越来越大，人员越来越多。这是为什么呢？原因是多方面的，但其中一个重要的原因，就是在减人并机构以后，没有不断革命，没有狠抓机关革命化和人的思想革命化，作风没有彻底转变，因此又走了回头路。正象群众所批评的：“新摊摊，老一套，还要走那旧道道。”在总结了过去的教训以后，昔阳县革委会一方面组织机关干部学习毛主席有关改进领导作风的教导，一方面组织大家进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，使广大干部认清大搞机关革命化，彻底转变思想作风的重要性。大家认为：革委会是无产阶级的权力机构，作风必须适应革命的需要，过去那套适应修正主义需要的旧作风如果不彻底改变，就不能很好地为革命服务，甚至会产生新的修正主义苗子。革委会的工作人员，如果不能清除旧作风，建立新作风，就不能和群众心贴心，就不能当好人民的勤务员。经过学习讨论，大大提高了干部大搞机关革命化的自觉性。昔阳县革委会于是在去年十二月做出了认真转变工作作风的决定，在今年庆祝革委会成立一周年的时候，常委会又做了讨论修改。革委会的机关革命化和工作人员的思想革命化，越来越深入地开展起来。
    坚决走革命化的道路
    昔阳县革委会在精简机构以后，是怎样狠抓机关革命化和工作人员思想革命化的呢？
    鼓足革命干劲，一个人顶几个人干。林彪副主席指示我们说：“我们搞社会主义建设，要多快好省，要高速度。紧张，就是要多快好省，就是要鼓足干劲，就是要力争上游。……没有干劲是不行的，要有干劲，要雷厉风行，要争时间。”昔阳县革委会抓机关革命化，突出地抓人的干劲，抓干劲首先抓思想。他们在机关大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织干部们以光辉的“老三篇”为武器，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个英雄形象为榜样，开展斗私批修，改造世界观。为了解决“人少事多难干”的思想，曾多次组织革委会的成员和工作人员到英雄的大寨大队参观学习，和大寨社员比，和大寨干部比。大家认识到：“钢硬，铁硬，用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，比钢铁还硬。毛泽东思想武装起来的人，干劲估不透，力量用不尽，什么困难也能战胜。”为什么大寨社员为革命种田，一人能顶几个人干，而我们机关工作人员为革命工作，却不能一人顶几个人干？通过查思想，找差距，鼓干劲，革委会的工作人员革命精神大振，纷纷主动挑重担，一个人干过去几个人干的工作，一天完成过去几天完成的任务。
    突出无产阶级政治，把干劲用在狠抓根本上。革委会工作人员的革命干劲鼓起来以后，又面临着干什么、怎样干的问题。有的人受旧习惯势力的影响，干劲虽然大，但跳不出老框框，结果辛辛苦苦不分上下班地忙，最后还是跌到事务主义的泥坑里。县革委会主任陈永贵同志很反对这种瞎忙的工作作风。他说：“千忙万忙，不突出无产阶级政治，是瞎忙。”他根据大寨十多年走过的路子，参加县革委会工作以后，就提出：“我们一个人顶几个人干，干就要干在高举一面红旗，狠抓一个纲，建设一个班子上，要做到‘三不脱离’。”在陈永贵同志的带领下，昔阳县革委会始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争这个纲，努力建设革命化的联系群众的领导班子，革委会的成员做到不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，不脱离艰苦生活。这样，有了一个人顶几个人干的革命干劲，又有了工作千头万绪抓根本的工作方法，昔阳县革委会逐步培养出一种突出无产阶级政治的雷厉风行的作风。他们办事不含糊，说干就干，不该过夜的从不过夜。从县革委会成立以来，每当毛主席一项最新指示发表，他们都是早晨发表，早晨贯彻；中午发表，中午贯彻；晚上发表，连夜贯彻。他们总是把毛主席的指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，及时地、全面地、准确地落实到广大群众中去，变为群众的自觉行动。
    头头参加具体工作，以身作则带头实干。毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。昔阳县革委会为了打破旧机构那种“头头多，动嘴的人多，动手的人少”的旧作风，不仅在精简机构时减少了头头，而且要求头头们参加具体工作，带头实干。县革委会脱产的七名副主任和常委，除副主任李韩锁负责全面工作外，其余六人都兼各组的具体工作，既是革委会的领导成员，又是革委会的普通工作人员。领导成员和一般工作人员坐在一起办公，一块研究工作，一块处理问题，工作一竿子插到底。一般问题分别由各组办事人员研究处理，改变了过去大事小事一律请示，头头说了算数的状况。组里能解决的问题就不再把矛盾上交，这个组能办的事，就不推到另一个组。群众到革委会办事情，除了一些重大问题需要革委会集体研究解决外，大量的事都能随到随办。
    坚持下乡蹲点跑面的制度，到第一线发现问题和解决问题。毛主席教导我们：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事”。“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”遵照毛主席的教导，昔阳县革委会的领导干部经常带头深入第一线，定队蹲点，分片包面，定期接头，局部性的问题就地解决，普遍性的问题集中起来在面上解决。这样，大量的问题随时随地就在下面解决了。基层干部和广大社员群众满意地说：“过去领导找不见，如今面对面。请示问题和商谈工作，在地头、饭场、路边、家门口就办了。”
    领导带队轮流到生产队当社员，加强同群众的血肉联系。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”昔阳县革委会针对过去县里有些干部下乡，说的多干的少，教育别人多改造自己少，没有真正体会到社员的冷热，没有真正同群众打成一片的问题，在今年四月做出决定：领导带队轮流到生产队当社员，一次半个月或一个月。现在，先后已有三批干部到生产队当过社员。他们在当社员时，和社员流一样多的汗，滚一样多的泥巴，同劳动人民的阶级感情大大加深。回到革委会以后，心里时时想着群众，工作事事依靠群众，能够真正代表群众的利益，坚定地带领群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进。
    坚持半天劳动，半天工作。昔阳县革委会的成员和工作人员，遵照毛主席的“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。……这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义”这一伟大教导，除下乡时走到那里就在那里参加劳动外，留在机关也坚持上午劳动，下午和晚上办公。他们学习大寨自力更生的精神，自己动手建立劳动基地，为社会主义创造财富。几个月来，革委会的干部脸晒黑了，手上磨起了茧子，为人民服务的心炼得更红了。他们深有体会地说：“手里握紧锄把子，才能为人民掌好印把子。”
    昔阳县革委会在精兵简政以后，狠抓机关革命化和工作人员的思想革命化，树立了崭新的革命作风。他们带领全县十八万人民紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，做出了突出的成绩。广大群众赞扬说：“革委会里的同志，真是咱们的好当家。大权交给他们掌，咱们一百个放心！”
                                    （段存章）
