The Working Class Has Limitless Wisdom

— A Collection of Technical Innovations and Revolutions

Under the inspiring situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers in many places have kicked out the bourgeois technical "authorities," fully playing the leading role of the working class in technical innovations and revolutions, and successfully trial-produced many new products. Practice has once again proven that Chairman Mao's statement that "the lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish" is an unbreakable great truth.

A New Type of Diesel Engine Suitable for Rural Needs

Workers at the Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory in Jiangsu kicked out the interference and sabotage of bourgeois technical "authorities" and independently designed and manufactured a new type of diesel engine. This diesel engine is lightweight, compact, powerful, and has minimal vibration, making it suitable for rural needs.

This factory has a history of several decades. In the past, due to the factory's capitalist-roaders implementing the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, some bourgeois technical "authorities" monopolized the factory's technical power, and for a long time, they could not produce a diesel engine suitable for China's rural needs. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," and decided to design and manufacture a new type of diesel engine suitable for rural needs on their own. They broke through various obstacles set by the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," organized a design team consisting mainly of workers and technicians of worker origin, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "in strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," and fought continuously for seven days and nights to produce a design plan.

To produce the prototype as soon as possible, all the workers in the factory displayed the spirit of bravery, fearlessness, endurance, and continuous fighting, overcame a series of technical difficulties, and in just forty-five days, successfully manufactured the prototype of the new Type 195 diesel engine. After testing, it was proven that this new type of diesel engine not only completely eliminated the defect of excessive vibration but also reduced the weight by five kilograms compared to the prototype designed by the bourgeois technical "authorities." Currently, the workers of Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory are further conducting comprehensive performance tests on the new Type 195 diesel engine and will then officially start production.

Plastic Model Paper

With the strong support and cooperation of relevant units in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, workers at Suzhou Red Light Paper Mill successfully trial-produced plastic model paper after several months of repeated experiments, creating more advanced technical conditions for the mass printing of Chairman Mao's works.

With plastic model paper, plastic printing plates can be made. The successful trial production of plastic model paper will revolutionize the printing industry's lead plate printing technology, which has been used for hundreds of years. Using plastic printing plates is cost-effective, convenient to operate, greatly reduces printing processes, improves working conditions, and reduces labor intensity.

In the past, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, there was a long-term reliance on foreign imports for plastic model paper. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers at Suzhou Red Light Paper Mill, under the conditions of having no data, no technology, no equipment, and no raw materials, followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "making up our minds, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," overcame various difficulties, and finally, with the strong cooperation of relevant units, successfully trial-produced the first batch of domestically produced plastic model paper. After four months of trial printing, it was proven that domestically produced plastic model paper and plastic printing plates can completely replace lead plates.

Electronic Counting Capsule Filling Machine

Revolutionary workers at Hangzhou Medical Instrument Factory and Hangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Factory independently designed and successfully manufactured an electronic counting capsule filling machine.

The successful trial production of this machine provides favorable conditions for improving the packaging technology in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past, the capsule filling process in the pharmaceutical industry was manually operated, with high labor intensity, inaccurate counting, and poor hygiene, which easily affected the quality of the drugs. After the successful trial production of the electronic counting capsule filling machine, preliminary statistics show that it can increase production efficiency by more than ten times, ensure the quality of drugs, and reduce drug costs.

The process of trial-producing this machine was permeated with intense struggles between the two classes and two lines. Revolutionary workers in these two factories fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents during the Cultural Revolution, and with the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, finally, under the conditions of having no data, no equipment, and no experience, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, successfully trial-produced this machine and put it into production.

Semiconductor Photoelectric Weft-Finding Device

Workers and revolutionary technicians at Hangzhou Textile Machinery Factory broke through the barriers set by the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," and in just one and a half months, successfully manufactured a semiconductor pulse-type photoelectric weft-finding device, making new contributions to the electrification and automation of China's silk industry.

Automatically finding the weft and automatically throwing the shuttle is an important link in the automation of silk looms. In 1965, young electrician Han Bingrong from this factory, along with other workers, following the great leader Mao Zedong's teaching of self-reliance and hard struggle, actively advocated for independently experimenting and creating a new weft-finding device. However, their revolutionary proposal was brutally suppressed by the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in this factory.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory took power, and workers and revolutionary technicians once again proposed the study of new weft-finding technology devices and established an experimental group in May this year, starting the battle. After repeated experiments and with the support of relevant units, they finally successfully trial-produced the semiconductor pulse-type photoelectric weft-finding device in mid-July. After nearly twenty days of continuous on-site testing, it was proven that the performance was good and met the design requirements.

Gantry Chain Bucket Sand Loading Machine

Workers at the Bengbu Railway Bureau Loading and Unloading Machinery Factory, with the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, successfully trial-produced a gantry chain bucket sand loading machine, raising the level of sand loading machinery operations in China to a new height.

This machine, after being used, proved to have a simple structure and good performance, capable of loading ten tons of sand per minute, twenty times more efficient than manual labor, and only taking five minutes and thirty seconds to load a car with fifty tons.

Originally, this machine was designed by a bourgeois technical "authority" from the Bengbu Railway Bureau Loading and Unloading Machinery Factory. He worked in isolation for over a year but produced something that was completely unusable. The workers angrily kicked out the bourgeois technical "authority" and decided to build the sand loading machine themselves. They organized a design team, without blueprints, relying on their rich practical experience, thinking and acting on the spot; when materials were insufficient, they used processed scrap materials as substitutes. During the trial production process, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "self-reliance," fiercely criticized the "creeping philosophy" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and in less than four months, successfully trial-produced this gantry chain bucket sand loading machine.

This sand loading machine can also be used to load coal, salt, grain, and crushed stone into cars, with significantly improved efficiency compared to manual labor.

    工人阶级有无限的聪明才智
    ——技术革新和技术革命集锦
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势鼓舞下，许多地方的工人群众，踢开资产阶级技术“权威”，在技术革新和技术革命中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，试制成功了许多新产品。实践再一次证明，毛主席指出的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    适合农村需要的新型柴油机
    江苏常州柴油机厂的工人，踢开了资产阶级技术“权威”的干扰和破坏，自行设计制造了一台新型柴油机。这种柴油机重量轻，体积小，马力大，震动小，适合农村需要。
    这个厂是个有几十年历史的老厂，过去由于厂里走资派推行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，让一些资产阶级技术“权威”独霸了全厂技术大权，长期生产不出一台适合我国农村需要的柴油机。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命工人遵循毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，决心自己设计制造适合农村需要的新型柴油机。他们冲破了资产阶级反动技术“权威”的种种刁难，组织了一支以工人和工人出身的技术人员为主体的设计小组，反复学习毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，连续奋战七昼夜，搞出了设计方案。
    为了早日制成样机，全厂工人发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，克服了技术上一连串的困难，用短短四十五天时间，就胜利地制造出了新一九五型柴油机的样机。经过试车证明，这种新型柴油机不仅完全消除了震动大等缺点，而且重量比资产阶级技术“权威”设计的样机减轻了五公斤。目前，常州柴油机厂的广大工人正在进一步对新一九五型柴油机的性能作全面审核试验，然后再正式投入生产。
    塑料模型纸
    苏州红光造纸厂的工人，在北京、上海等有关单位大力支持和协作下，经过几个月的反复试验，试制成功了塑料模型纸，为加速大量印制毛主席著作，创造了更先进的技术条件。
    有了塑料模型纸就可以制出塑料印版。塑料模型纸的试制成功，将使印刷工业数百年来一直沿用的铅版印刷工艺为之一新。应用塑料印版，成本低、操作方便，大大减少印刷工序，同时，又可以改善劳动条件，减轻劳动强度。
    过去由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义科技路线，迷信专家，依靠洋货，长期来，塑料模型纸只能靠国外进口。在无产阶级文化大革命中，苏州红光造纸厂的工人在一无资料、二无技术、三无设备、四无原料的情况下，遵循毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，克服种种困难，终于在有关单位大力协作下，试制成功了第一批国产塑料模型纸。经过四个月的试印，证明国产塑料模型纸和塑料印版，完全可以代替铅版。
    电子计数胶丸装瓶机
    杭州医疗器械厂和杭州中药厂的革命职工，自己设计、自行制造成功了一种电子计数胶丸装瓶机。
    这台机器的试制成功，为改进制药工业包装工艺提供了有利条件。过去制药工业上的胶丸装瓶工艺是用手工操作的，劳动强度大，计数不易准确，而且不卫生，易影响药品质量。电子计数胶丸装瓶机试制成功后，据初步统计，可提高生产效率十倍多，而且计数准确，保证了药品质量，降低了药品成本。
    试制这台机器的过程，自始至终贯串着两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。这两个厂的革命职工在文化大革命中大造了党内一小撮走资派的反，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义科技路线，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，终于在没有资料，没有设备，没有经验的困难条件下，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使这台机器试制成功，并投入了生产。
    半导体光电探纬装置
    杭州纺织机械厂的工人和革命技术人员，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线和资产阶级反动技术“权威”设置的条条框框，只用一个半月时间，就制造成功了半导体脉冲式光电探纬装置，为我国丝绸工业的电气化、自动化作出了新的贡献。
    织绸机实行自动探纬、自动发梭，是织绸机实行自动化生产的重要一环。一九六五年，这个厂的青年电工韩丙荣同其他工人一起，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于自力更生，艰苦奋斗的教导，积极主张自己动手试验创造一种新的探纬装置。可是他们的革命建议却被这个厂的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”粗暴地扼杀了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌了权，工人和革命技术人员又一次提出研究探纬新技术装置的建议，并在今年五月间成立试验小组，开始了战斗。经过反复试验，并在有关单位的支持下，终于在七月中旬试制成功了半导体脉冲式光电探纬装置。经过近二十天连续运转的实地试验，证明性能良好，符合设计要求。
    门式链斗装砂机
    蚌埠铁路分局装卸机械厂的工人，发扬自力更生，奋发图强的革命精神，试制成功了一台门式链斗装砂机，使我国装砂机械作业提高到一个新的水平。
    这台机器经过使用，证明它的结构简单，性能良好，每分钟可装砂十吨，比人工作业提高二十倍，装五十吨的车厢只要五分三秒。
    原先，这台机器由蚌埠铁路分局装卸机械厂的一个资产阶级技术“权威”设计。他闭门造车，搞了一年多，搞出个东西来，却根本不能使用。工人们气愤地踢开了资产阶级技术“权威”，决心自己动手来造一台装砂机。他们自己组织了一个设计小组，没有图纸，就凭自己丰富的实践经验，边想边干，实地操作；材料不足，就用废料加工代替。在试制过程中，他们反复学习毛主席关于“自力更生”的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“爬行哲学”，经过不到四个月的时间，就试制成了这台门式链斗装砂机。
    这台装砂机也可以用来往车厢里装煤、装盐、装粮食和碎石，效率都比人工作业显著提高。
