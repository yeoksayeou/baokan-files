	Solemnly swearing allegiance to Chairman Mao,
	The naval unit's Huang Jianming quickly wiped away the tears from his face and eagerly picked up the joyful drumsticks. He danced and sang with all his heart. Revolutionary committees have been established in Tibet and Xinjiang. Ah! The entire nation is red, and the soldiers shout loudly: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live! The great commander's order resounds across the land, and the Cultural Revolution's flames burn fiercely. The East Wind blows strongly inside and outside the Great Wall. The working class is the leading class, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers are the vanguard in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The workers, peasants, and soldiers rule the world, standing tall and fearless. The military and people of the entire nation follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, smashing the den of revisionism to smithereens. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, revolutionary committees have been established throughout the country. Chairman Mao has personally nurtured this, and now the flowers bloom in full glory. Quickly wipe away the tears from your face and eagerly pick up the joyful drumsticks. At this incredibly joyous moment, we solemnly swear to Chairman Mao: We will forever be your loyal soldiers, resolutely defending the revolutionary committees. Anyone who dares to overthrow the red regime will be smashed to pieces!
