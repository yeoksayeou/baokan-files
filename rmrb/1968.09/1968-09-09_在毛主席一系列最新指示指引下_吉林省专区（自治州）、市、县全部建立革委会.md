In the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all fifteen prefectures (autonomous prefectures), cities, and thirty-eight counties in Jilin Province have established revolutionary committees. Currently, the entire province is witnessing a widespread and in-depth mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. There is a strong focus on revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, timely and thorough implementation of struggle, criticism, and transformation, rapid industrial production growth, and a promising agricultural harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 8th: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, all fifteen prefectures (autonomous prefectures), cities, and thirty-eight counties in Jilin Province have established revolutionary committees. Ninety-eight percent of the rural people's communes in the province and the majority of factories, enterprises, shops, schools, and other grassroots units have also achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

"The ship of revolution sails with the helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Jilin Province, holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," have waged a tenacious struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jilin Province. In March of this year, they achieved a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and established the provincial revolutionary committee. The revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have continued to advance, establishing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, overcome bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity in many grassroots units according to systems, industries, and classes. This has powerfully promoted the birth of revolutionary committees at all levels.

The great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jilin Province actively lead the broad revolutionary masses to deeply and persistently expose, criticize, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Jilin Province. They have combined revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, striking down a handful of hidden spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, greatly strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in Jilin Province is excellent. The mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought has never been as widespread and in-depth as it is today. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." Since this year, industrial production in Jilin Province has rapidly increased. The production of major industrial products such as coal and automobiles has significantly increased, and the railway transportation tasks have been well completed. With the deepening of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units, new things continue to emerge on the industrial front. Many factories and enterprises have seen a thriving technological revolution. On the agricultural front, due to the efforts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, based on the fact that agriculture has had good harvests for many years, this year they have overcome droughts and pestilences, and the crops in most areas are growing well, with a bumper harvest in sight.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play." "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combinations, carry out big criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office personnel, and in factories, go through the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation."

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Jilin Province have seriously studied Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully bring into play the leading role of the working class, focus on revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, and timely and thoroughly carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下
    吉林省专区（自治州）、市、县全部建立革委会
    当前，全省掀起广泛深入的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，狠抓革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作，不失时机地认真地搞好斗批改，工业生产迅速上升，农业生产丰收在望
    新华社长春八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，吉林全省十五个专区（自治州）、市和三十八个县，全都建立了革命委员会。全省百分之九十八的农村人民公社和大多数厂矿、企业、商店、学校等基层单位，也都实现了革命的三结合。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    吉林省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在吉林省的代理人进行了英勇顽强的斗争，在今年三月夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，建立了省革命委员会。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署乘胜前进，继续大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，克服资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使全省许多基层单位都很快地实现了按照系统、按照行业、按照班级的革命大联合，从而有力地促进了各级革命委员会的胜利诞生。
    伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在毛主席最新指示的指引下，吉林省各级革命委员会积极带领广大革命群众，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北地区和吉林省的代理人，展开了深入持久的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，并把革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮暗藏的特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，大大加强了无产阶级专政。
    当前，吉林省革命和生产形势大好。全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，从来没有象今天这样广泛深入，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从来没有象今天这样深入人心。“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。今年以来，吉林省工业生产迅速上升。煤炭、汽车等主要工业产品的产量大幅度增长，铁路交通运输任务也完成得很好。随着各单位斗、批、改的深入开展，工业战线上不断涌现出一些新事物，不少厂矿企业已出现了蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命热潮。农业战线，由于广大贫下中农的努力，在农业多年获得丰收的基础上，今年又战胜了旱灾、虫灾，大部分地区庄稼长势良好，丰收在望。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”
    吉林省各级革命委员会认真学习了毛主席极为重要的最新指示，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，狠抓革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作，不失时机地认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
