The tractor and farm tool repair factory in Zanzibar, built with Chinese aid, was completed and held its opening ceremony on August 31. The first vice president of Tanzania, Karume, presided over the ceremony and expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for their assistance.

A correspondent of Xinhua News Agency reported from Zanzibar on August 31 that the factory, located two miles south of Zanzibar City in Mbweni, was adorned with festive decorations. The national flags of Tanzania and China were flying above the main gate.

In his speech at the opening ceremony, Vice President Karume thanked the Chinese government and people for their aid. He said, "This is not just my personal gratitude, but the gratitude of all the people of Tanzania."

Rashid Abdulla, the Minister of Agriculture and Land Reform of Zanzibar, said in his speech, "Agriculture is the core of our national economy." He mentioned that since the January 1964 revolution in Zanzibar, with the cooperation of the People's Republic of China, Zanzibar has acquired more tractors. He also noted that Chinese engineers and technicians are currently training a group of Zanzibari youth, who are making rapid progress.

Jiang Da, the Chinese economic representative in Tanzania, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of Zanzibar.

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Karume and his wife, accompanied by the head of the Chinese technical team, inspected the workshops equipped with Chinese machinery. They listened with great interest to the explanations given by the Zanzibari youth and observed their operations.

Attending the opening ceremony were also ministers of Zanzibar, members of the Revolutionary Council, and officials of the Zanzibar Ministry of Agriculture. Liu Qingyou, the Chinese vice-consul in Zanzibar, and Chinese agricultural technicians working at the Ubenge State Farm in Zanzibar also attended the ceremony.
