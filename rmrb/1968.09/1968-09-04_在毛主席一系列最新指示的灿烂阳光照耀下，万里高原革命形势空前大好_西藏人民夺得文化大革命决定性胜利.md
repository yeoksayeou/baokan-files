Under the brilliant sunlight of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary situation on the vast plateau is extremely good. The people of Tibet have achieved a decisive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. They have fiercely exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, settled accounts with the heinous crimes of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's treasonous clique, and significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Most counties in the autonomous region have achieved revolutionary unity, and some counties have established revolutionary committees. The military and the people share the same breath, the same fate, and fight side by side. Agricultural and pastoral production is thriving.

New China News Agency, Lhasa, September 3rd: Under the brilliant sunlight of the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, and under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the Tibet Autonomous Region have, after more than two years of heroic struggle, achieved a decisive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought shines over the vast plateau, and the revolutionary situation in Tibet is extremely good and getting better.

Currently, most counties in the autonomous region have achieved revolutionary unity, and some counties have established revolutionary committees. Most grassroots units have either established revolutionary committees or achieved revolutionary unity.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." The first generation of the new working class in Tibet and their reliable allies—the million emancipated serfs—have established immortal merits in Tibet's Cultural Revolution. They have united with the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups and the revolutionary Red Guards, raised high the revolutionary banner of Chairman Mao's "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Tibet, thoroughly exposing their heinous crimes of colluding with the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's treasonous clique and the remnants of the Kuomintang, attempting to restore the feudal serf system and capitalism in Tibet. The revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups have displayed the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, broken through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and smashed the counterattacks of the class enemies time and time again. Finally, they have exposed a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, achieving a decisive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

In the fierce and complex class struggle, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially the study and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution, in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They have launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They have followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and with the help of the PLA stationed in Tibet, they have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, the region has held more than 10,000 study classes, with more than one-third of the revolutionary people participating in the study. The PLA has sent a large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, tirelessly crossing mountains and rivers, bringing the great Mao Zedong Thought to remote villages and pastures. On the vast grasslands, a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team crossed an ice river and climbed over two snow-capped mountains to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the only household living there. This Tibetan herding family, seeing the portrait of Chairman Mao carried by the soldiers, was deeply moved, with tears rolling down their cheeks, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" The broad masses of Tibetan herdsmen were deeply moved by the soldiers' enthusiastic propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: The soldiers gave us a gold mountain, which will eventually be used up, but they gave us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which will bring endless happiness to our descendants. Now, from the foothills of the Himalayas to the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, from the Lhasa Valley to the vast northern Tibetan grasslands, everywhere is bathed in the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad emancipated serfs said excitedly: The Himalayas are high, but not as high as Chairman Mao's kindness; the Yarlung Zangbo River is long, but not as long as Chairman Mao's kindness. The red hearts of a million emancipated serfs are loyal to Chairman Mao, unshakable even if the sky falls and the earth cracks!

With boundless proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a deep revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet. While fiercely exposing and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, they have also settled accounts with the heinous crimes of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's treasonous clique in opposing socialism, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and attempting to restore the feudal serf system. Through the revolutionary criticism, the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the million emancipated serfs has been significantly raised. They said: The Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of bad guys, together with the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, these reactionary serf owners, are sitting on the same carpet and eating from the same bowl, grabbing tsampa. They are wolves in sheep's clothing, and we must expose all the wolves hiding among the sheep!

Under the guidance of the great policy of Chairman Mao, "Grasp the revolution, promote production," the revolutionary situation has promoted the great development of production. Currently, in the granary of Tibet, along the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, the wheat waves are rolling, golden yellow, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Some areas with early maturity have already started harvesting. On the vast northern Tibetan grasslands, cows and sheep are gathered, fat and strong. The whole region presents a thriving scene. The broad emancipated farmers and herdsmen are full of vigor and are striving to achieve the tenth consecutive bumper harvest year after the democratic reform.

"The military and the people are united as one, who can defeat us?" The heroic PLA stationed in Tibet has responded resolutely to the great order of the great commander Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and has insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses. They have shared the same breath, the same fate, and fought side by side with the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, making great contributions to Tibet's Cultural Revolution. The broad officers and soldiers who are vigilant a hundred times on the border line, with their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, together with the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, have smashed the various sabotage plots of the class enemies at home and abroad time and time again, repelled the armed provocations of the Indian reactionaries, and bravely defended the Cultural Revolution and the national border, building an indestructible steel wall in the southwestern border.

Respected Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts. The million emancipated serfs in Tibet love you dearly! They shout and sing a thousand times, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的灿烂阳光照耀下，万里高原革命形势空前大好
    西藏人民夺得文化大革命决定性胜利
    各族革命人民掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，清算了达赖、班禅叛国集团的滔天罪行，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。全自治区大部分县实现革命大联合，部分县成立了革命委员会。军民同呼吸，共命运，并肩战斗。农牧业生产欣欣向荣。
    新华社拉萨三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的灿烂阳光照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，西藏自治区各族革命人民经过两年多来的英勇斗争，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉普照万里高原，西藏的革命形势空前大好，越来越好。
    目前，全自治区大部分县实现了革命的大联合，部分县成立了革命委员会。大部分基层单位，都相继成立了革命委员会或实现了革命的大联合。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”西藏的第一代新兴的工人阶级和他们的可靠同盟者——百万翻身农奴，在西藏的无产阶级文化大革命中创立了不朽的功勋。他们团结各族革命人民和革命的红卫兵小将，高举毛主席的“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在西藏的代理人发动猛烈进攻，彻底揭露了他们招降纳叛，结党营私，勾结达赖、班禅叛国集团和国民党残渣余孽，妄图在西藏复辟封建农奴制度和资本主义的滔天罪行。各族广大革命群众发扬无产阶级的大无畏革命精神，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重阻力，粉碎了阶级敌人的一次又一次反扑，终于揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，西藏各族革命人民把活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。他们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在人民解放军西藏驻军的帮助下，大办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，全区已办学习班一万多期，三分之一以上的革命人民参加了学习。人民解放军派出的大批的毛泽东思想宣传队，不辞辛苦，跋山涉水，把伟大的毛泽东思想送到偏僻的村庄和牧场。在辽阔的草原上，有一个毛泽东思想宣传小组，踏过冰河，翻过两座大雪山，向住在那里的仅有的一户牧民宣传毛泽东思想。这户藏族牧民看到解放军扛着的毛主席画像，非常感动，两眼滚动着热泪，不断地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”广大藏族牧民对解放军这样热情地宣传毛泽东思想，深受感动。他们说：解放军给我们送来一座金山，总有用完的一天，给我们送来战无不胜的毛泽东思想，子孙万代幸福无边。现在，从雪峰林立的喜马拉雅山麓到白浪滔滔的雅鲁藏布江畔，从拉萨河谷到千里藏北草原，到处都沐浴着毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。广大翻身农奴激动地说：喜马拉雅山再高，没有毛主席的恩情高；雅鲁藏布江再长，没有毛主席的恩情长。百万翻身农奴忠于毛主席的红心，天塌地裂不动摇！
    西藏各族革命人民怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，开展了深入的革命大批判。他们在狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的同时，还清算了达赖、班禅叛国集团反对社会主义、反对毛泽东思想，妄图复辟封建农奴制度的滔天罪行。通过革命的大批判，百万翻身农奴的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮坏蛋，同达赖、班禅这些反动的农奴主坐在一条卡垫上，在一个碗里抓糌粑，是披着羊皮的豺狼，我们一定要把混在羊群里的狼统统地揪出来！
    在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，革命的大好形势推动了生产的大发展。目前，在西藏的粮仓雅鲁藏布江沿岸，麦浪翻滚，一片金黄，丰收在望。部分成熟早的地区已开镰收割。在千里藏北草原，牛羊成群，膘肥体壮。全区到处呈现一派欣欣向荣的动人景象。广大翻身农牧民，正意气风发地夺取民主改革后第十个连续的特大丰收年。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”英雄的驻藏人民解放军广大指战员，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，坚持用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，同各族革命人民同呼吸，共命运，并肩战斗，为西藏的无产阶级文化大革命做出了巨大贡献。百倍警惕地守卫在边防线上的广大指战员，怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，和各族革命人民一道，一次又一次地粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的种种破坏阴谋，打退了印度反动派的武装挑衅，英勇地保卫了无产阶级文化大革命和祖国边防，在西南边疆筑起了一道坚不可摧的钢铁长城。
