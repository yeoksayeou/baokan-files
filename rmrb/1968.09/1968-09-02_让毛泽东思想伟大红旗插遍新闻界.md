Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over the news industry. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region vehemently denounce the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev regarding news work. They will forever uphold the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought over news work.

Yang Daogen (an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought, a combat hero, and deputy political commissar of a certain regiment in the Nanjing Military Region):

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Chairman Mao also teaches us that to run a newspaper well, "this is a matter of great principle in the Party's work that cannot be underestimated." The top capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposes our great leader Chairman Mao, strenuously opposing the Party's leadership over the news industry. In his black "directives" on the work of news agencies, he says, "Are our news agencies 'state-run' or 'privately-run'? Now everything has become state-run, even agricultural cooperatives have become state-run." "The issue is not to emphasize the official identity too much, and even less to bind oneself too tightly." This is sheer revisionist nonsense.

State-run means implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev raises the black flag of "not state-run," aiming to seize the news front from the Party, to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, to abolish the Party and the great Mao Zedong Thought's absolute leadership over the news industry, and to turn the proletarian news industry into a tool for his capitalist restoration. He wants to let ghosts and monsters run wild and let bourgeois ideology spread freely, waiting for the opportunity to achieve his counter-revolutionary goal of changing the regime. In the end, the struggle between the Chinese Khrushchev and the Party for leadership over the news industry is a struggle between restoration and anti-restoration.

The Party's leadership is the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our proletarian news work. Whether to uphold the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought or to oppose it is the question of which path the news work will take, whether it will serve the dictatorship of the proletariat or serve capitalist restoration, and it is the fundamental dividing line between proletarian news work and revisionist news work.

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The enemy opposes the Party's leadership over news work, which precisely shows the great power of the Party's leadership and shows how much the enemy fears Mao Zedong Thought. We are right to uphold the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought! We must forever uphold the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought over the news industry. Whoever opposes the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought must be resolutely overthrown!

We must praise the people and strike down the enemy.

Ma Chenglong (a model soldier):

The top capitalist-roader within the Party has long been extending his poisonous hands into the news industry, spreading a lot of poison. He madly shouts, "Now the reporting of international news has only one side: criticizing the United States and praising ourselves." He also says, "This one-sided reporting will create illusions." This is a great slander against our proletarian news industry and a vicious attack on Chairman Mao's proletarian news line.

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed; all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised." Whether to expose or praise the bourgeoisie, and whether to praise or vilify the proletariat, this is a fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian news line and the reactionary bourgeois news line.

The news industry is an important tool of class struggle. Any class, in order to consolidate its rule, will use every means to utilize the news industry as a tool to praise its own class and expose the enemy class, making the news industry serve its political goals. The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen, personally supported by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out capitalist restoration, did not use the old Beijing Daily, Beijing Evening News, and Frontline, which they had seized, to launch a mad attack on us, the proletariat, in an attempt to implement bourgeois dictatorship?

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our proletarian newspapers love what the people love and hate what the people hate. Our newspapers must praise the people, expose the enemy, and become the sharpest weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking down the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's line of mass-run newspapers.

Lu Guangyuan (news officer):

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our newspapers should also be run by everyone, by all the people, by the entire Party, and not just by a few people behind closed doors." Comrade Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "We should not run newspapers behind closed doors but should face the masses, have a clear direction, and be fresh and lively." Running newspapers by the entire Party and by the masses is Comrade Chairman Mao's consistent thought on running newspapers and the fundamental line for running good proletarian newspapers. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party blathers on about "in the entire society, you (referring to reporters) have a special job, things that others cannot do or do poorly, some specialized people, who do not do other things or do fewer other things, specialize in this one thing." His evil purpose is to lead news workers to a path of spiritual aristocracy, detached from social practice and from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, becoming the "un-crowned kings" of the bourgeoisie. This is sheer revisionist nonsense about running newspapers by "experts."

The top capitalist-roader within the Party is an old counter-revolutionary. He knows very well that if he does not seize the newspapers to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, it is impossible to achieve capitalist restoration. Advocating the line of running newspapers by "experts" is precisely to achieve his evil goal of usurping the proletarian news front.

If our newspapers are detached from the masses, they are detached from politics, detached from Mao Zedong Thought, and will fall into the path of bourgeois news work. Only by relying on the masses can we run good newspapers. Those bourgeois "experts" have the ability to run revisionist newspapers but no ability to run good proletarian newspapers. Ask yourself, can those articles written by workers, peasants, and soldiers and published in the newspapers be written by those "experts" with bourgeois ideas in their heads? In your pen, only poisonous weeds like "Cultivation" can be written, and no revolutionary articles can be written.

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the line of running newspapers by "experts" to rob us, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, of our right to speak in the newspapers. Because he knows that the broad masses of workers and peasants have the deepest class feelings for Comrade Chairman Mao and the deepest love for Mao Zedong Thought, and the large-scale publication of articles by workers and peasants in the newspapers will frustrate his conspiracy to create public opinion for capitalist restoration. We proletarian news workers must resolutely implement Comrade Chairman Mao's line of mass-run newspapers and never let the Chinese Khrushchev's conspiracy succeed.

Smash the revisionist theory of "universal interest."

Huang Jiafu (a former volunteer army first-class demolition hero and deputy battalion commander):

Comrade Chairman Mao's proletarian news line has the most distinct class character and the strongest fighting spirit. The top capitalist-roader within the Party vigorously advocates that news reporting should have "universal interest," which is sheer bourgeois revisionist garbage.

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Interest also has class character. The interest of the top capitalist-roader within the Party is fundamentally opposed to ours. His so-called "universal interest" is, in essence, the interest of the bourgeoisie, the interest of the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and the interest of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Our struggle with the top capitalist-roader within the Party is a struggle between enemies; our struggle with them is a life-and-death struggle. Can we talk about common "interest" with the enemy? No! A thousand times no! A million times no! If we are to talk about interest, we have only the interest of the proletariat, the interest of highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, and the interest of thoroughly overthrowing the top capitalist-roader within the Party. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily published a series of important articles criticizing the top capitalist-roader within the Party. As soon as these articles were published, our unit immediately organized study sessions and discussions. The soldiers read them over and over again, unable to put them down. Ask yourselves, Chinese Khrushchev and your lackeys, can you be interested in such articles?

We are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and our army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must hold the gun tightly and also hold the pen tightly. In news reporting, we cannot give the class enemy even a bit of "interest," not even half a bit! We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, uphold the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought in news reporting, thoroughly criticize the revisionist garbage of "universal interest" peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on the news front!

Forever be news warriors of Chairman Mao.

Zhou Zhenxin (news officer):

The top capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to turn the proletarian newspapers into a tool for his capitalist restoration, uses bourgeois fame and profit as bait to corrupt and disintegrate the proletarian news team. He shamelessly advocates that reporters become famous and successful, saying, "Reporters also have their day to shine," "Let reporters have fame and profit," "Reporters should become famous," and so on.

Look! How filthy the soul of this Chinese Khrushchev is! He openly peddles the reactionary philosophy of life and the revisionist garbage of "material incentives" and "money as the commander" advocated in the black "Cultivation." We proletarian news warriors do not want any of his rotten goods!

Comrade Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests." This is the motto of us proletarian news warriors. Our proletarian news team should be a revolutionary team that is "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Our fundamental task is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the best way to serve the people.

I was transferred from the company to the headquarters to do reporting work last year. I have been in the army for a short time, lack experience in unit work, and my ideological level is not high. I have repeatedly studied Comrade Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and his instructions on running newspapers, drawing endless strength from them. We revolutionary fighters write to the Party newspaper, not for fame or profit, but to propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought. Our revolutionary enthusiasm comes from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and from our limitless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao. We do not consider personal fame and profit at all but will strive for the proletarian revolutionary cause all our lives.

    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍新闻界
    南京部队某部指战员痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫关于新闻工作的谬论
    永远坚持毛泽东思想对新闻工作的绝对领导
    杨道根（南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、战斗英雄、某团副政委）：
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”毛主席又教导我们，办好报纸，“这是党的工作中的一项不可小看的、有重大原则意义的问题。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，公然同我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，极力反对党对新闻事业的领导。他在对通讯社工作的黑“指示”中说，我们的通讯社“是官办还是民办？……现在什么东西都变为官办，连农业合作社也成为官办的。”“问题是不要老是强调官方身份，更不要把自己束缚得死死的”。这是彻头彻尾的修正主义滥调。
    官办，就是实行无产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫打出“不要官办”这面黑旗，是要向党争夺新闻阵地，是要取消无产阶级专政，是要取消党和伟大的毛泽东思想对新闻事业的绝对领导，妄图把无产阶级的新闻事业，变成他复辟资本主义的工具，让牛鬼蛇神肆意出笼，让资产阶级思想自由泛滥，待机实现他的反革命变天的目的。归根结底，中国赫鲁晓夫同党争夺新闻界领导权的斗争，就是复辟与反复辟的斗争。
    党的领导，就是毛泽东思想的领导。毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级新闻工作的灵魂。坚持毛泽东思想的领导，还是反对毛泽东思想的领导，这是新闻工作走哪一条道路的问题，是为无产阶级专政服务还是为资本主义复辟服务的问题，是无产阶级新闻事业同修正主义新闻事业的根本分界线。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人反对党对新闻工作的领导，正是说明党的领导的强大威力，说明敌人对毛泽东思想怕得要死。我们坚持毛泽东思想的领导，做对了，好极了！我们要永远坚持毛泽东思想对新闻事业的绝对领导，谁反对毛泽东思想的领导，就坚决打倒谁！
    我们要歌颂人民，打击敌人
    马承龙（五好战士）：
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，长期以来，把带着毒菌的黑手伸进新闻界，放了大量的毒。他疯狂叫嚣“现在的国际新闻报道只有一面：骂美国的，说我们好的。”还说什么“这种片面性的报道，会造成假象”。这是对我们无产阶级新闻事业的极大污蔑，是对毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线的恶毒攻击。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”。对资产阶级是暴露还是歌颂，对无产阶级是歌颂还是丑化，这是毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线同反动的资产阶级新闻路线的一个根本分歧。
    新闻事业是阶级斗争的重要工具。任何一个阶级，为了巩固他们的政权，都要千方百计地利用新闻事业这个工具歌颂本阶级，暴露敌对阶级，使新闻事业为本阶级的政治服务。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派亲自扶植的彭真反革命修正主义集团，为了推翻无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟，不是曾经利用被他们窃踞的旧《北京日报》、《北京晚报》、《前线》，向我们无产阶级疯狂进攻，妄图实行资产阶级专政吗？
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们无产阶级的报纸，爱人民大众之所爱，恨人民大众之所恨。我们的报纸就是要歌颂人民，暴露敌人，成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的最锐利的武器。
    坚决贯彻毛主席的群众办报路线
    罗光远（新闻干事）：
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”毛主席最近又一次指出：“不应当关门办报，应面向群众，又要有大方向，又要新鲜活泼。”全党办报，群众办报，是毛主席一贯的办报思想，是办好无产阶级报纸的根本路线。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却胡说什么“在整个社会中间，有你们（指记者）的特殊职务，别人做不好、不能做的，有些专门的人，不做别的事情，或者少做别的事情，专门做这件事情”。他的罪恶目的，是把新闻工作人员引向脱离社会实践、脱离工农兵群众的精神贵族的道路，成为资产阶级的“无冕之王”。这是彻头彻尾的“专家”办报的修正主义路线。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是一个反革命的老手。他很懂得，如果不把报纸抓在手里大造反革命舆论，要实现资本主义复辟是不可能的。鼓吹“专家”办报的路线，就是为了达到他篡夺无产阶级新闻阵地的罪恶目的。
    我们的报纸如果脱离了群众，就是脱离了政治，脱离了毛泽东思想，就会走入资产阶级新闻路线的歧途。只有依靠群众，才能办好报纸。那些资产阶级“专家”，他们只有办修正主义报纸的本领，决无办好无产阶级报纸的“才能”。试问，报纸上登载的工农兵写的许多好文章，那些满脑袋资产阶级思想的“专家”能写得出来吗？在你中国赫鲁晓夫的笔下，只能写出《修养》这样的大毒草，决不能写出一篇革命文章来。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“专家”办报路线，为的是要剥夺我们工农兵在报纸上的发言权。因为他知道，广大工农兵对毛主席的阶级感情最深厚，对毛泽东思想最热爱，工农兵的文章在报纸上大量发表，他们为复辟资本主义制造舆论的阴谋就会破产。我们无产阶级新闻工作者，一定要坚决贯彻毛主席的群众办报路线，决不让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞。
    砸烂修正主义的“普遍兴趣”论
    黄家富（前志愿军一级爆破英雄、副营长）：
    毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线，有最鲜明的阶级性，最强烈的战斗性。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大肆鼓吹什么新闻报道要有“普遍兴趣”，这完全是资产阶级的修正主义的黑货。
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”兴趣也是有阶级性的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的兴趣同我们的兴趣就是根本对立的。他的所谓“普遍兴趣”，说穿了，就是资产阶级的兴趣，资产阶级反动“权威”的兴趣，就是反革命修正主义的兴趣。
    我们同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是敌我矛盾；我们同他们的斗争，是生死斗争。我们能和敌人讲共同“兴趣”吗？不能！一千个不能！一万个不能！如果要讲兴趣，我们只有无产阶级的兴趣，突出毛泽东思想的兴趣，彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的兴趣。在无产阶级文化大革命中，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表了一系列批判党内最大的一小撮走资派的重要文章，这些文章一发表，我们部队立即组织学习，座谈讨论。战士们百读不厌，爱不释手。试问中国赫鲁晓夫和他的娄罗们，你们能够对这样的文章感到兴趣吗？
    我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，我们的军队是无产阶级专政的柱石。我们既要握紧枪杆子，又要握紧笔杆子。在新闻报道中我们不能给阶级敌人一点“兴趣”，半点也不给！我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在新闻报道中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“普遍兴趣”的修正主义黑货，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在新闻阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    永远作毛主席的新闻战士
    周振新（新闻干事）：
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，为了把无产阶级的报纸变成他复辟资本主义的工具，以资产阶级名利思想为钓饵，腐蚀、瓦解无产阶级的新闻队伍。他厚颜无耻地鼓吹记者成名成家，胡说什么“记者也有出头的一日”，“让记者有名有利”，“应该让记者出名”等等。
    看！这个中国赫鲁晓夫的灵魂肮脏到何等地步！他公开贩卖在黑《修养》中鼓吹的那种“人不为己，天诛地灭”的反动人生哲学和“物质刺激”、“金钱挂帅”的修正主义黑货。我们无产阶级的新闻战士，根本不要他那一套臭货色！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”这是我们无产阶级新闻战士的座右铭。我们无产阶级的新闻队伍应该是一支“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的革命队伍。我们的根本任务就是宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想就是最好地为人民服务。
    我是去年从连队调到机关搞报道工作的。我参军时间短，缺乏部队工作经验，思想水平也不高。我反复学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和关于办报工作的指示，从中汲取了无穷无尽的力量。我们革命战士向党报写稿，一不为名，二不为利，就是为了宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。我们的革命积极性来源于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，来源于我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。我们丝毫不为个人名利打算，而要一辈子坚定不移地为无产阶级革命事业奋斗。
