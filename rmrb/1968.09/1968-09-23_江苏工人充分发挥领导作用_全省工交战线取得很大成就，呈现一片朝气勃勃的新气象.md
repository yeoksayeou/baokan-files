Jiangsu workers have fully exerted their leading role, and the province's industrial and transportation sectors have achieved great successes, presenting a vibrant new scene.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 22: The broad masses of workers in Jiangsu Province's industrial and transportation sectors have high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and vigorously promoted revolution and production, achieving great successes. The revolutionary and production situation in the province's industrial and transportation sectors is excellent, presenting a vibrant new scene.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Jiangsu Province has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments in revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, as well as in the cleanup of class ranks and streamlining of organizations. They have fully exerted their leading role. The revolutionary workers of Nanjing City have smashed the various sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies, taking the lead in achieving revolutionary unity. After the workers of two factions in Wuxi City achieved revolutionary unity, they advanced victoriously and achieved unified leadership by industry and system, setting an example for the entire province. The development of revolutionary three-in-one combinations in industrial and transportation enterprises has also been rapid, and most enterprises have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. The revolutionization of thought has promoted the great development of industrial production. This year, the province's total industrial output has risen steadily, with each month surpassing the previous one and each quarter surpassing the previous one. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the province's total industrial output in July and August also saw a significant increase. The production of thirty major products, including steel, steel products, diesel engines, tractors, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, fertilizers, pesticides, and machine-made paper, has all increased significantly. The textile workers of the entire province have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "tightly grasp the production of cloth," and their production achievements are even more outstanding. A number of textile factories in Nantong, Wuxi, and other places have already surpassed their historical highest production levels.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fully exerting the leading role of the working class, the workers of the entire province have been greatly inspired. Under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, various factories have quickly selected outstanding worker representatives to form a grand Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which has marched to colleges, universities, and units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, and has been warmly welcomed and supported by the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and masses.

In recent periods, industrial and transportation enterprises in various places have more broadly held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

In the great revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the revisionist line of "expert management," "crawling policy," "slavery policy," and other lines promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, breaking through the shackles of "foreign dogma" and "foreign frameworks," greatly inspiring revolutionary spirit, and causing a new high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution throughout the province.

    江苏工人充分发挥领导作用
    全省工交战线取得很大成就，呈现一片朝气勃勃的新气象
    据新华社南京二十二日电　江苏省工交战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了很大成就。全省工业交通战线的革命生产形势大好，呈现一派朝气勃勃的新气象。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，江苏省工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合方面，在清理阶级队伍、精兵简政等工作中，充分发挥了领导作用。南京市的革命职工粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的种种破坏活动，一马当先实现了革命大联合。无锡市两派工人实现革命大联合后，乘胜前进，按行业按系统实现了归口大联合，为全省树立了榜样。工业交通企业的革命三结合发展也很迅速，大部分企业已经成立了革命委员会或革命领导小组。思想革命化促进了工业生产的大发展。今年以来，全省工业总产值直线上升，一月胜过一月，一季超过一季。在毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，七、八月份全省工业总产值又有较大幅度的增长。钢、钢材、柴油机、拖拉机、棉纱、棉布、化肥、农药、机制纸等三十种主要产品的产量都有大幅度增加。全省纺织工人响应毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，生产成绩更为突出。南通、无锡等地一批纺织工厂产量已超过历史最高水平。
    毛主席关于充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的最新指示发表后，极大地鼓舞了全省工人群众。在各级革委会的统一领导下，各地工厂迅速选出优秀工人代表，组成浩浩荡荡的毛泽东思想宣传队，开赴大中学校和没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，受到了广大革命师生和革命群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
    各地工交企业最近一个时期，更加广泛地举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新的高潮。
    广大革命职工在革命大批判中，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”、“奴隶主义”等一套修正主义路线，冲破了“洋教条”“洋框框”的束缚，大大激发了革命精神，全省出现蓬蓬勃勃的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动新高潮。
