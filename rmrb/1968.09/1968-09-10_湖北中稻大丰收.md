In the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Hubei Province have enthusiastically responded to the great call of Chairman Mao, the great leader, to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have emphasized proletarian politics, overcome drought and flood disasters, and following the bumper harvests of summer grain and early rice, have achieved another bumper harvest of middle rice across the province.

At present, Hubei's vast rural areas are bustling with activity. The middle rice harvesting work in various places has been completed, and now efforts are concentrated on threshing and shelling. In the main middle rice producing areas of Jingzhou and in parts of Xiangyang, Dongfeng, and Yichang, the middle rice yield has generally increased compared to last year's bumper harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing the bumper harvest, are overjoyed. They excitedly say, "This year's bumper harvest of middle rice is a victory of Chairman Mao's great policy of 'grasp revolution and promote production,' and a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Hubei, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have bravely fought against drought and flood disasters in the process of achieving this year's bumper harvest of middle rice. Just as the middle rice was sprouting and tillering, drought occurred everywhere. The main middle rice producing areas of Jingzhou, Dongfeng, and Xiangyang experienced drought for two consecutive months. After July, heavy rains fell in large areas of northern, central, and eastern Hubei. The concentration, duration, and scope of the rainfall all exceeded historical records. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," overcame numerous difficulties and triumphed over the drought and flood disasters.

In the struggle to achieve the bumper harvest of middle rice, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hubei, with deep proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, the great leader, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With unprecedented political enthusiasm, they have carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, which has powerfully promoted the development of production.

    湖北中稻大丰收
    新华社武汉九日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，湖北省广大贫下中农和社员群众热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，突出无产阶级政治，战胜旱涝自然灾害，继夏粮、早稻丰收之后，又取得了全省中稻大丰收。
    目前湖北广大农村到处是一片繁忙景象，各地中稻收割工作已经结束，现在正集中力量抓紧打场脱粒，中稻主要产区的荆州地区和襄阳、东风、宜昌等专区种植中稻的部分地区，中稻普遍比丰收的去年增产。广大贫下中农看到丰收的大好景象，兴高采烈，他们激动地说，今年中稻大丰收是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的湖北广大贫下中农和社员群众在夺取今年中稻丰收过程中，同旱涝灾害进行了英勇搏斗。正当中稻返青发蔸时期，各地普遍发生旱象，荆州、东风、襄阳等中稻主要产区干旱持续了两个月之久。七月份以后，湖北北部、中部和东部大片地区又连降暴雨，雨量之集中、时间之长、范围之广，都超过了历史上的最高纪录。但是，广大贫下中农和社员群众遵照伟大领袖毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，克服重重困难，战胜了旱涝灾害。
    在夺取中稻丰收的斗争中，湖北省广大贫下中农满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以空前未有的政治热情，深入、持久地开展了革命大批判，有力地推动了生产的发展。
