Japanese workers, peasants, and students march together in protest

The Japanese reactionary government's counter-revolutionary face is once again exposed

	New Xinhua News Agency, September 16th - According to the Oriental News Agency, approximately seven hundred progressive young workers and students from various parts of Hokkaido gathered in a meeting on the 15th in the suburbs of Sapporo City, Nagashima Town, to strongly oppose the Japanese "Defense Agency's" plan to establish a missile base in this town.

	The Japanese "Defense Agency," according to the provisions of the third phase of the military expansion plan, intends to build a missile base near Nagashima Town to station a battalion of "Nike-Hercules" missile troops, thereby strengthening nuclear armaments.

	Local farmers organized the "Anti-Missile Base Alliance" to oppose the Japanese "Defense Agency's" evil deeds. They also joined forces with progressive workers and students in Hokkaido to fight against this. Representatives of young workers, students, and farmers at the meeting unanimously strongly condemned the establishment of a missile base in Nagashima Town, protesting against the Japanese reactionary government's evil schemes to strengthen nuclear armaments and prepare for aggressive war, and expressed their determination to block the implementation of this reactionary plan. The resolution passed at the meeting emphasized that this struggle, along with the struggle to withdraw American military bases and refuse American military transportation, is an important part of the struggle against the arming of Japan with nuclear weapons and the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan system of aggression against Asia, and expressed their determination to carry this struggle through to the end.

	After the meeting, the participants, holding red flags and banners, marched through the streets of the town in a demonstration. Along the way, they shouted slogans such as "Stop the establishment of the missile base," "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty system," and so on.

	After the demonstration, some students marched towards the missile base construction site several kilometers away from Nagashima Town and pulled out twelve stakes used by the "Defense Agency" for ground surveying.

	When the masses were marching and demonstrating, the reactionary police authorities dispatched more than five hundred armed police and plainclothes officers to suppress them, arresting three students on the spot.

	The Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique verbally shouts "oppose the missile base," but secretly instructs its followers to slander the struggles of the youth, students, and farmers, and even destroyed the propaganda posters and banners of this meeting, once again exposing their counter-revolutionary faces, which further aroused the strong condemnation of the youth, students, and farmers.

Some students, workers, and farmers from other universities also participated in the demonstration march.

    不许佐藤反动政府在长沼镇建立导弹基地
    日本工人、农民、学生并肩示威
    宫本修正主义集团指使暴徒破坏群众斗争，再次暴露反革命嘴脸
    新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本北海道各地的进步青年工人和学生约七百人，十五日在札幌市郊区的长沼镇举行集会，强烈反对日本“防卫厅”打算在这个城镇建立导弹基地。
    日本“防卫厅”根据第三期扩军计划的规定，打算在长沼镇附近修建导弹基地，以便在那里驻扎一营“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹部队，加强核武装。
    当地农民组织了“反对导弹基地同盟”，反对日本“防卫厅”的这一罪恶行径，他们还同北海道进步工人和学生一起进行斗争。青年工人、学生和农民代表在会上一致强烈谴责在长沼镇建立导弹基地，抗议日本反动政府加强核武装和准备侵略战争的罪恶勾当，并表示坚决要阻止这个反动计划的实现。集会通过的决议强调，这场斗争同要求撤除美国军事基地和拒绝美国军事运输的斗争，是反对用核武器武装日本、反对加强日美侵略亚洲体系的重要斗争的组成部分，并表示决心要把这场斗争进行到底。
    会后，与会者高举红旗和标语牌，在城镇的街道上举行了示威。他们沿途高呼“制止建立导弹基地”、“粉碎日美安全条约体系”等口号。
    示威后，部分学生向离长沼镇若干公里的导弹基地工地进发，拔掉了“防卫厅”用来进行地面测量的十二个桩子。
    当群众游行示威时，反动警察当局出动了武装警察和便衣队共五百多人进行镇压，当场逮捕了三名学生。
    日共宫本修正主义集团在口头上也叫喊“反对导弹基地”，但是暗地里却指使它的党徒诬蔑青年、学生和农民的斗争，并且毁坏了这个大会的宣传招贴和标语牌，又一次暴露了他们的反革命面目，从而更加激起了青年、学生和农民对他们的强烈谴责。
