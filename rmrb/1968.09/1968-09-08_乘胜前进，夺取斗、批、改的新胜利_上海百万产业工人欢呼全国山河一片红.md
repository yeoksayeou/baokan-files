	Buoyed by victory, Shanghai's million industrial workers rejoice as the red sun rises over the entire nation!

	In exultation, they celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committees in Tibet and Xinjiang!

	In exultation, they celebrate the red sun rising over the entire nation!

	In exultation, they celebrate the nationwide advance of the Cultural Revolution into the stages of struggle, criticism, and reform!

	Shanghai, the birthplace of the great January Revolution, is in a state of jubilation! Over the course of twenty months of great struggle, Shanghai's million industrial workers have made tremendous contributions. With boundless joy and fervent revolutionary spirit, they celebrate the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution across the nation. Filled with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

	At 8:30 PM on the 6th, the grand clock tower by the Huangpu River resounded with the majestic melody of "The East is Red," heralding the thrilling news from the Tian Shan Mountains and the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River. It announced the great news that Revolutionary Committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the nation, except for Taiwan. Instantly, the banks of the Huangpu River were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and red flags fluttered across Shanghai's streets. Tens of millions of revolutionary people were immersed in boundless happiness. From the evening of the 6th to the 7th, in front of the steel furnaces, beside the machine tools, on the docks, and in moving trains, countless people were earnestly studying the important editorial "Long Live the Complete Victory of the Cultural Revolution!" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. Countless people were passionately discussing the new battle orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. People held the revolutionary treasure, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and stood before Chairman Mao's portrait, solemnly vowing: We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and stride forward to accomplish the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform!

	Shanghai's million industrial workers, who have made tremendous contributions during the Cultural Revolution, are particularly excited. They joyfully gather together, discussing the great victories achieved over the past two years and looking forward to the bright revolutionary future, their spirits surging and their enthusiasm soaring. Tang Wenlan, a female Communist Party member who started as a child worker, is now a leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the 17th Cotton Mill. In 1966, when the capitalist roaders were rampant, she and six comrades posted the first big-character poster in the entire mill, fiercely attacking the capitalist roaders. After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, the 17th Cotton Mill underwent earth-shaking changes, rising from being one of the most backward mills in the city's textile system to becoming a model of progress. This year, production has been increasing month by month. Today, Tang Wenlan and some of her old comrades discussed the victorious battle history, their hearts filled with boundless excitement. She said: To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the hardest road must be taken, and the heaviest burden must be borne. As long as we follow the great leader Chairman Mao, we will be invincible.

	On the docks along the Huangpu River, which stretch for dozens of miles, the heroic Shanghai dock workers have established immortal merits in the great January Revolution storm. Twenty months ago, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party stirred up the counter-revolutionary economic wind, attempting to sabotage production and the Cultural Revolution. In those turbulent days, the broad masses of dock workers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely fought against the class enemies. They stood firm at their production posts and, with the support of the proletarian revolutionaries across the city, rushed to transport a large amount of backlogged materials. Over the past twenty months, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely grasped class struggle, and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism. The docks presented a vibrant and new revolutionary scene. Today, after studying the important editorial "Long Live the Complete Victory of the Cultural Revolution!", the dock workers proudly declared: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin has issued new battle orders, and we will resolutely respond, determined to accomplish the great task of struggle, criticism, and reform and achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution!

	The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, who are currently running "Anti-Japanese War-style" Mao Zedong Thought study classes, passionately discussed the factory's plans for struggle, criticism, and reform amidst the joyous celebrations. The factory Revolutionary Committee held a meeting to discuss the newly drafted plan for struggle, criticism, and reform. Zhang Meihua, a famous mirror grinding expert and worker by origin, who is a leader of the factory Revolutionary Committee, said: Chairman Mao has shown us the way forward, and we will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We will definitely do a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform, welcome the new high tide of the industrial revolution, and turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In response to the great call from the great leader Chairman Mao to "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," Shanghai's working class has sent a large number of excellent workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and enter universities to lead the educational revolution. On the evening of the 6th, the joyous news of the red sun rising over the entire nation reached the propaganda teams and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff stationed in various universities. Some formed joyous teams and reported the good news to the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee overnight. Many soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Fudan University, together with the Red Guards, solemnly vowed before Chairman Mao's portrait to carry the educational revolution of the proletariat to the end! Guo Sanzhen, a young female worker from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, who participated in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, said: The working class must lead everything, which means leading everything with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, our working class can smash the old educational system and establish a brand-new proletarian educational system!

	On the night of the 7th, Shanghai was brightly lit, and fireworks bloomed along the Huangpu River. The parade continued without interruption. From the evening of the 6th to the night of the 7th, people joyously celebrated the red sun rising over the entire nation and loudly sang the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of Shanghai are more spirited and full of fighting spirit. They are determined to unite with the proletarian revolutionaries across the nation around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, advancing from victory to new victories.

    在绵延数十里的黄浦江两岸的码头上，英雄的上海码头工人，在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中立下了不朽的功勋。在二十个月以前，党内一小撮走资派刮起反革命经济主义妖风，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在那恶浪翻滚的日子里，广大码头工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，同阶级敌人进行了英勇的斗争，他们坚守生产岗位，在全市无产阶级革命派支持下，抢运了大量的积压物资。二十个月来，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，码头上呈现出一派蓬蓬勃勃的崭新革命景象。今天，码头工人们学习了重要社论《无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！》以后，无比自豪地表示：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出了新的战斗号令，我们坚决响应，一定胜利完成斗、批、改的伟大任务，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功！
    正在大办“抗大式”毛泽东思想学习班的上海机床厂的工人们，在一片欢庆声中热烈地讨论了厂内斗、批、改的部署。厂革委会开会讨论了新拟订的斗、批、改规划。厂革委会负责人、工人出身的著名的镜面磨削能手张梅华说：毛主席给我们指出了前进的道路，我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定认真搞好斗、批、改，迎接工业革命新高潮，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    上海工人阶级响应伟大领袖毛主席发出的“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大号召，派出大量优秀工人，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻大专院校，领导学校的教育革命。六日晚上，全国山河一片红的喜讯传来，进驻各大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队和革命师生员工，举行了庆祝集会。有的组成报喜队，连夜到上海市革命委员会报喜，进驻复旦大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的许多战士，同红卫兵小将一起，在毛主席像前庄严宣誓，一定要把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、上海柴油机厂青年女工郭三珍说：工人阶级要领导一切，就是用毛泽东思想领导一切。有毛泽东思想领路，我们工人阶级就能够摧毁旧的教育制度，建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度！
    七日夜晚，上海全市灯火辉煌，黄浦江畔礼花缤纷，游行队伍接连不断。人们从六日晚到七日夜，纵情欢呼全国山河一片红，高声歌唱毛主席无产阶级革命路线取得的伟大胜利。在毛泽东思想哺育下的上海革命人民，更加意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们决心和全国各地无产阶级革命派紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从胜利走向新的胜利。　新华社记者
