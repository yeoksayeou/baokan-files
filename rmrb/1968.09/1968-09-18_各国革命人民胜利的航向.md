On September 18, 1962, Chairman Mao Zedong inscribed a calligraphy for Japanese worker friends: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt." Today marks the sixth anniversary of this brilliant inscription. The People's Daily has published the calligraphy of Chairman Mao's inscription on the front page. Chairman Mao's inscription has extremely important and far-reaching significance not only for the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people but also for the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries in the world.

Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement. Marxism-Leninism is the crystallization of the most correct and revolutionary scientific thought of the world proletariat, a universal truth applicable everywhere. Once the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses of various countries grasp Marxism-Leninism, they can generate boundless wisdom and strength to promote the victorious development of the revolutionary cause. The combination of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the revolution in various countries is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause of the people of various countries.

In leading the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "We must completely and appropriately unite the universal truths of Marxism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution." "To closely link the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, this is the consistent ideological principle of our Party." The Communist Party of China has done just that. The universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, once combined with the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of the people, become the weapon of the Chinese people that is invincible in a hundred battles.

Comrade Mao Zedong vividly compared the linking of theory and practice to "shooting an arrow at a target." Comrade Mao Zedong used the "arrow" of Marxism-Leninism to hit the "target" of the Chinese revolution, solving a series of theoretical, line, policy, strategy, and tactical problems in the periods of the Chinese democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thus, he led the Chinese revolution from one victory to another.

The principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the revolution in one's own country applies not only to the Chinese revolution but also to the revolutions in Japan and all other countries. This means that the proletarian parties of various countries must, on the one hand, adhere to the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, and on the other hand, must proceed from actual life, closely link with the masses, constantly summarize the experience of the masses' struggle, and independently formulate and implement policies and strategies that suit their own country's conditions. The Khrushchev revisionist clique, under the pretext of "creatively developing Marxism-Leninism," abandoned the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, which is sheer opportunism, i.e., modern revisionism!

The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist traitor clique, headed by Nomiya, under the pretext of "different domestic and international conditions in Japan," advocates "independence and self-reliance," which are all lies. They also hang the banner of Marxism-Leninism, but what they vigorously attack and oppose is precisely the most fundamental aspects of Marxism-Leninism. They distort and emasculate Marxism-Leninism, oppose violent revolution, oppose armed seizure of power, advocate so-called "peaceful revolution," and promote the so-called "parliamentary road." In reality, they do not want revolution, betray revolution, and oppose revolution. They are a bunch of shameless traitors to Marxism-Leninism and traitors to the Japanese revolutionary cause.

Today, the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people is flourishing, the revolutionary consciousness of the Japanese people is constantly rising, and the genuine Marxist-Leninist leftist forces are growing stronger and stronger. The revolutionary vanguard of the Japanese proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses are vigorously criticizing the revisionist clique headed by Nomiya, using genuine Marxism-Leninism as a powerful weapon to oppose American imperialism, oppose the Japanese monopoly bourgeoisie, and oppose modern revisionism. The revolutionary situation in Japan is getting better and better. The revolutionary vanguard of the Japanese proletariat realizes that the glorious and serious task before them is to further seriously apply genuine Marxism-Leninism to the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, proceed from the specific conditions of Japan, solve a series of strategic and tactical problems of the Japanese revolution, and continuously advance the Japanese revolution. The process of the Japanese revolution achieving victory is necessarily a process in which Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution are increasingly closely combined.

We are firmly convinced that a genuine revolutionary party in Japan, armed with Marxism-Leninism, will definitely be born in the fiery struggle of the revolution. It will lead the Japanese proletariat and the broad masses of the people through a long and tortuous struggle, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and win the final victory of the revolution.

### 各国革命人民胜利的航向

    各国革命人民胜利的航向
    一九六二年九月十八日，毛泽东主席给日本工人朋友赠了亲笔题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”今天是这一光辉题词的六周年纪念，本报在头版位置上发表了毛主席题词的手迹。毛主席的这个题词，不仅对于日本人民的革命事业，而且对于世界各国人民的革命事业，具有极其重大而深远的意义。
    没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动。马克思列宁主义是世界无产阶级最正确最革命的科学思想的结晶，是放诸四海而皆准的普遍真理。各国的无产阶级和广大革命人民，一旦掌握了马克思列宁主义，就能够产生无穷无尽的智慧和力量，去推动革命事业的胜利发展。马克思列宁主义与各国革命的具体实践相结合，这是各国人民革命事业取得胜利的最根本的保证。
    毛主席在领导中国革命的过程中反复地教导我们：“必须将马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践完全地恰当地统一起来”。“把马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命的实践密切地联系起来，这是我们党的一贯的思想原则。”中国共产党正是这样做的。马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，一经同中国无产阶级和广大人民群众的革命斗争的实践相结合，就成为中国人民百战百胜的武器。
    毛泽东同志把理论和实践相联系这件事，生动地比作为“有的放矢”。毛泽东同志就是用马克思列宁主义之“矢”，射中国革命之“的”，解决了中国民主革命、社会主义革命时期以及在无产阶级专政底下继续进行革命的一整套理论、路线、方针、政策和策略问题，从而把中国革命从胜利引向胜利。
    马克思列宁主义同本国革命的具体实践相结合，这一条原则适用于中国革命，也适用于日本和一切国家的革命。这就是说，各国的无产阶级政党，一方面必须坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，同时，必须从实际生活出发，密切联系群众，不断总结群众斗争的经验，独立地制定和实行符合本国情况的政策和策略。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，借口什么“创造性地发展马克思列宁主义”，而抛弃了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，那是十足的机会主义，即现代修正主义！
    日共宫本修正主义叛徒集团借口日本“国内外条件”不同，标榜什么“独立自主”，其实都是鬼话。他们在口头上也挂着马克思列宁主义，但是他们所起劲地攻击和反对的，正是马克思列宁主义的最根本的东西。他们竭力歪曲和阉割马克思列宁主义，反对暴力革命，反对武装夺取政权，鼓吹所谓“和平革命”，推行所谓“议会道路”。实际上就是不要革命，背叛革命，反对革命。他们是一伙地地道道的马克思列宁主义的可耻叛徒，是日本革命事业的可耻叛徒。
    今天，日本人民的革命斗争正在蓬勃兴起，日本人民的革命觉悟不断提高，真正的马克思列宁主义的左派队伍正在日益成长壮大。日本无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民，大造宫本修正主义集团的反，把真正的马克思列宁主义作为他们反对美帝国主义、反对日本垄断资产阶级、反对现代修正主义的强大武器。日本革命的形势越来越好。日本无产阶级革命派认识到，摆在自己面前的一个光荣而严肃的任务，就是要进一步认真地把真正的马克思列宁主义具体运用到日本人民革命斗争的实践中去，从日本的具体情况出发，解决日本革命的一系列战略和策略问题，把日本革命不断地推向前进。日本革命取得胜利的过程，必然是马克思列宁主义和日本革命的具体实践日益紧密地相结合的过程。
    我们坚信，一个用马克思列宁主义武装起来的日本真正的革命党，一定会在革命斗争的烈火中诞生。它将领导日本无产阶级和广大人民，经过长期曲折的斗争，战胜一切艰难险阻，赢得革命的最后胜利。
