	Struggles against American imperialism and monopoly capitalism are flaring up around the world.

	In Denver, Colorado, and Waterloo, Iowa, black people have bravely taken up arms to resist police brutality.

	In Denver, Colorado, over 200 black youth took to the streets on the nights of the 12th and 13th, armed with stones and bottles, to resist the brutal suppression by fascist police. They even overturned two police cars. Despite the reactionary authorities deploying a large number of police and a helicopter to release large amounts of tear gas on the black community, some armed blacks still fired back, injuring three fascist police.

	In Waterloo, Iowa, on the night of the 13th, black masses also launched a resistance struggle against fascist police. In the struggle, black snipers shot and injured six fascist police, and some blacks also set fire to several houses belonging to white racists.

	At the same time, on the night of the 13th, in Toledo, Ohio, over 500 black youth also launched a resistance struggle. On the nights of the 11th and 12th, in the suburbs of New York City and Chicago, there were also incidents of black snipers shooting at fascist police cars.

	Students in Colombia Demand the Expulsion of the U.S. "Peace Corps"

	Recently, students in Cali, Colombia, held a demonstration and occupied the sociology department of the local Valle University, demanding the expulsion of U.S. "Peace Corps" members in Colombia.

	Students wrote slogans on the walls condemning the "Peace Corps." They vowed to persist in their struggle until they drive out the U.S. "Peace Corps" members who are staying in the university under the pretext of "studying." They also demanded that the university stop the courses offered for "Peace Corps" members and expel the American "professors" teaching these courses. The students condemned these professors as "tools of the U.S. government to maintain social, political, and economic control in this part of the continent."

	Uruguayan Workers and Students Occupy State Slaughterhouse and Cold Storage Plant

	About 1,000 workers and students in the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo, occupied the state slaughterhouse and cold storage plant on the night of the 12th to protest the plant's unjust closure and the dismissal of 2,600 workers.

	That night, some middle school students held a demonstration in the capital's streets to support the workers' struggle. The Uruguayan authorities deployed police to suppress the students, who bravely retaliated with bricks against the police's tear gas attacks. Some students also occupied a middle school building. On the same night, workers also occupied an electrical appliance factory.

	Over 10,000 Italian Sailors Strike Against Brutal Exploitation

	Over 12,000 Italian sailors have been on strike for several days, resisting the brutal exploitation by the monopoly bourgeoisie and demanding improved living and working conditions.

	Sailors from the four major shipping companies under the Italian state-owned shipping investment company will go on strike for four days in Italian or other countries' ports. Italy's three main ocean liners—the "Raffaello," "Michelangelo," and "Colombo"—as well as many other passenger and cargo ships, have been forced to suspend operations starting from the 11th.
