With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, the poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of the school's leadership, grasped the school's political direction, and smashed the revisionist educational system. The campus is filled with a strong proletarian political atmosphere, and columns for revolutionary criticism are everywhere. The teachers and students' learning and life are both intense and lively.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 16th: The Yao Middle School in Duan Autonomous County, Guangxi, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, relying on poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the school, and has taken a gratifying step in realizing the proletarian educational revolution.

This Yao Middle School is located in the mountains of western Guangxi. After two years of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one immediately feels the strong proletarian political atmosphere upon entering the school gate. Revolutionary criticism columns are everywhere on campus. In the morning, teachers and students sing "The East Is Red" to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, and they practice military subjects in a lively manner according to the organizational structure of the army's platoons, companies, and battalions. During the "Daily Reading" sessions, everyone recites the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and studies Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the morning, students concentrate on learning cultural and scientific knowledge relevant to facing rural areas. In the afternoon, criticism and struggle meetings, and meetings for the practical application of Mao Zedong Thought, are held in a lively manner. In the evening, teachers and students participate in collective production labor in the fields and farmlands. At night, teachers and students discuss, review, and have heart-to-heart talks. Every day's learning and life are both intense and lively.

The great changes in the Yao Middle School are the results of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the school and carry out the proletarian educational revolution with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel. This middle school was established in 1957. All the teachers and students come from five ethnic groups, with Yao and Zhuang students accounting for 97%. Most of the students are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, due to the revisionist educational line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the school, the school was basically monopolized by bourgeois intellectuals. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely dissatisfied and strongly demanded the smashing of the old revisionist educational system.

Last spring, the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel entered the school and helped the teachers and students to resume classes and make revolution. The soldiers firmly implemented Chairman Mao's educational policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," guiding revolutionary teachers and students to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to run the school. They first relied on poor and lower-middle peasants to mobilize revolutionary teachers and students to start with carrying out revolutionary criticism to clarify the direction and line of educational reform. The leftist support personnel brought all the teachers and students to the production teams and invited poor and lower-middle peasants to the school. Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian educational revolution as a weapon, they held criticism meetings and denunciation meetings to settle accounts with the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in pushing the revisionist educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants recounted their bitter family histories of the past, saying excitedly: "In the old society, our ancestors were exploited and oppressed, had no culture, Chairman Mao led us to overturn the situation, sent you to school, hoping that after learning culture, you could wholeheartedly serve the people and forever defend the mountains and rivers of the working people. However, under the poison of the revisionist educational line of Chinese Khrushchev, some people, after studying for a few years, had their eyes raised to their eyebrows, looked down on workers and peasants, and forgot their roots. We poor and lower-middle peasants do not need such students." The teachers and students also stood up one after another to expose, denounce, and criticize the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the school, pushing the revisionist goods of grades first, promotion first, material incentives, pursuing fame and fortune, looking down on workers and peasants, detaching from reality, and detaching from labor, leading students to the capitalist road. The revolutionary criticism made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students have a deeper understanding: the school monopolized by bourgeois intellectuals is a hotbed for the restoration of capitalism. The leadership of the school must be in the hands of the proletariat, and rural schools must be managed by poor and lower-middle peasants to ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

How do the poor and lower-middle peasants manage the school? The experience of the Yao Middle School in Duan County is as follows:

1. Grasp the leadership. The poor and lower-middle peasants mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to carry out revolutionary criticism, focusing on the work of cleaning up the class ranks, exposing a handful of capitalist roaders in the school, and exposing a long-term infiltrator who had usurped the school's leadership. The composition of the cadre and teacher teams was purified. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the poor and lower-middle peasants patiently and enthusiastically helped the committee members to grasp the thought revolutionization, ensuring that the school's leadership is in the hands of those loyal to Chairman Mao. Recently, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants have directly participated in the school's leadership.

2. Grasp the political direction. The leftist support personnel and the school leadership often brought the teachers and students to the production teams to eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and to carry out revolutionary criticism together, making everyone remember the class bitterness and not forget the blood debt. Revolutionary teachers and students and poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's works together, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism together, and fiercely criticized the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in pushing "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" in the countryside. They often invited poor and lower-middle peasants to the school to give reports and hold lectures. They went to the front line of class struggle to learn class struggle, making the broad masses of teachers and students greatly improve their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and the political direction became clearer. The teachers and students said: the countryside is the best classroom, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are the best teachers. With the poor and lower-middle peasants supervising us, we can always follow Chairman Mao and will never lose our political direction. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, there was a period when some committee members and teachers were busy with affairs and teaching, neglecting the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The poor and lower-middle peasants who were active in studying Chairman Mao's works came to the school to give reports to revolutionary teachers and students, introducing their own and their production team's experiences in emphasizing proletarian politics, carrying out the revolution, and promoting production. Under the education and help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the revolutionary committee put the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, ensuring that amidst a thousand tasks, the fundamental task was not neglected.

3. Manage the teaching content. According to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, reform the teaching content and teaching plan, and conduct teaching according to the principles of combining theory with practice and being concise and precise. In the past, under the rule of the revisionist educational line, some students returned to the countryside and could not carry heavy loads or lift heavy objects. Some who learned about water pump structures could not operate water pumps, those who learned mathematics could not be accountants, could not measure land area, those who learned chemistry did not understand fertilization, and those who learned botany could not grow vegetables. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "We hope that after studying for a few years, you can come back to build a socialist new countryside, but who would have thought that after drinking ink for a few years, you became more stupid." This middle school, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, resolutely abolished the teaching system where theory was separated from practice, and according to the principles of facing the countryside, combining theory with practice, and being concise and precise, carried out a thorough reform of teaching. Chinese language was changed to study Chairman Mao's works and poems, combining theory with practice and implementing it in action. When learning about water pump structures, students were taken to the water pump station for on-site lectures; when learning geometry and trigonometry, they went to the wild to measure in real-time; when learning arithmetic and algebra, they invited the production team's accountants to evaluate the work points method. In teaching methods, the "injection method" and "stuffing method" were abolished, and the "inductive method" was adopted, with more discussion meetings and lectures held, and teacher-student mutual teaching and learning was carried out, abolishing the "one-man show" and insisting on the "many-voices forum." Students reflected that this way of teaching was deep, lively, memorable, and useful. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflected that this way of cultivating students was truly useful when they returned to the countryside.

4. Insist on productive labor. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions that education must be combined with productive labor, according to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the school established a system for teachers and students to participate in productive labor, and resolutely took the road of integrating with workers and peasants. In addition to organizing teachers and students to go to the countryside to labor according to the needs of the production teams they were connected with, the school also reclaimed land to plant vegetables and corn around the school, and raised pigs by themselves, so that all the teachers and students could participate in some productive labor every day. The teachers and students labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learning basic farming skills such as plowing, sowing, holding the plow, fertilizing, and planting vegetables, and some students became production experts. Insisting on participating in productive labor, the teachers and students tanned their skin, tempered their thoughts, and forged their loyalty to Chairman Mao, and their hearts were closer to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised, saying that the students cultivated by the Yao Middle School have high awareness, are cultured, love labor, and have such successors, we are at ease.

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线依靠贫下中农管理学校
    广西都安瑶族中学教育革命取得经验
    在解放军支左人员的帮助下，贫下中农掌握了学校的领导权，掌握了学校的政治方向，摧毁了修正主义的教育制度。校园里充满了浓厚的无产阶级政治空气，革命大批判专栏到处都是。师生们的学习和生活紧张而又生动活泼
    新华社南宁十六日电广西都安瑶族自治县瑶族中学，在人民解放军驻校支左人员的帮助下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，依靠贫下中农管理学校，在实现无产阶级教育革命方面迈出了可喜的一步。
    这所瑶族中学座落在桂西的丛山峻岭中。经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，人们走进校门，就立即感受到浓厚的无产阶级政治空气。校内到处是革命大批判专栏。清晨，师生们高唱《东方红》向毛主席致敬，按解放军班排连建制，生龙活虎地操练军事科目。天天读时，大家背诵“老三篇”，学习毛主席最新指示。上午，学生们聚精会神地学习有关面向农村的文化科学知识。下午，批判斗争会、活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，开得热火朝天。傍晚，师生们在菜地、田野参加集体生产劳动。入夜，师生们讨论、温课、互相谈心。每天的学习生活，紧张而又生动活泼。
    瑶族中学这种巨大的变化，是在解放军支左人员的帮助下，依靠贫下中农管理学校，进行无产阶级教育革命所取得的成果。这所中学是一九五七年建立起来的，全校师生来自五个民族，瑶族、壮族学生占百分之九十七。学生多数是贫下中农子女。过去由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在学校的代理人，推行修正主义教育路线，学校基本上被资产阶级知识分子所垄断。广大贫下中农对此极端不满，强烈要求摧毁修正主义的旧教育制度。
    去年春天，解放军支左人员进驻学校，帮助学校师生复课闹革命。指战员们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，引导革命师生依靠贫下中农办学校。他们首先依靠贫下中农，发动革命师生从开展革命大批判入手，明确教育改革的方向和路线。支左人员把全校师生带到生产队，把贫下中农请到学校来，以毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示为武器，开批判会、控诉会，清算中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的罪行。贫下中农讲述了过去苦难的家史，激动地说：在旧社会，我们祖祖辈辈受剥削、压迫，没有文化，毛主席领导我们翻了身，把你们送进学校，希望你们学了文化能全心全意为人民服务，永远保住劳动人民的江山。可是，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害下，有些人读了几年书，眼睛长到眉毛上去了，看不起工农，忘了本。我们贫下中农不需要那样的学生。师生们也纷纷起来揭发、控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在学校推行分数挂帅、升学第一、物质刺激、追求名利、轻视工农、脱离实际、脱离劳动等修正主义黑货，把学生引到资产阶级邪路的罪行。革命的大批判使广大贫下中农和革命师生更加深刻地认识到：资产阶级知识分子垄断的学校是复辟资本主义的温床。学校领导权必须掌握在无产阶级手里，农村的学校必须由贫下中农管理，才能保证毛主席无产阶级教育路线的贯彻执行。
    贫下中农怎样管理学校呢？都安县瑶族中学的经验是：
    一、掌握领导权。贫下中农发动革命师生，通过革命大批判，狠抓清理阶级队伍的工作，揪出了学校里的一小撮走资派，揪出了一个长期潜伏并窃踞了学校领导权的反革命分子，从组织上纯洁了干部和教师队伍。学校革委会成立以后，贫下中农又耐心、热情地帮助革委会成员狠抓思想革命化，保证学校的领导权掌握在忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命派手里。最近，遵照毛主席的最新指示，由贫下中农代表直接参加了学校的领导。
    二、掌握政治方向。支左人员和学校领导班子，经常把师生带到生产队，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，同办毛泽东思想学习班，同忆苦思甜，同开展革命大批判，使大家牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇。革命师生和贫下中农一同学习毛主席著作，一同斗私批修，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行“三自一包”“四大自由”的罪行。经常请贫下中农到学校来作报告，开讲用会。到阶级斗争第一线学习阶级斗争，使广大师生大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，政治方向更加明确。师生们说：农村是最好的课堂，贫下中农是最好的老师。有贫下中农监督我们，我们就能永远紧跟毛主席，永远不会迷失政治方向。革委会成立以后有一段时间，有些委员和教师忙于事务和抓教学，放松了活学活用毛主席著作。贫下中农学习毛主席著作积极分子就到学校来给革命师生作报告，介绍自己和本生产队突出无产阶级政治，抓革命、促生产的经验。在贫下中农的教育、帮助下，革委会把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在首位，做到千头万绪，千忙万忙，狠抓根本不转向。
    三、管教学内容。要按照贫下中农意见改革教学内容，改革教学计划，按照理论联系实际和少而精的原则进行教学。过去在修正主义教育路线统治下，学生回到农村，有些人肩不能挑，手不能提，有的学了水泵构造不会开抽水机，学了数学不会当会计，不会量土地面积，学了化学不懂施肥，学了植物学不会种菜。贫下中农气愤地说：“我们指望你们学了几年能回来建设社会主义新农村，谁知你们喝了几年墨水却越喝越蠢。”这个中学根据贫下中农的意见，坚决废除理论脱离实际的教学制度，按照面向农村、理论和实际相结合、少而精的原则，大刀阔斧地改革教学。语文改学毛主席著作和毛主席诗词，联系实际活学活用，落实到行动。学水泵构造，就把学生带到抽水站现场讲用；学几何、三角就到野外实地测量；学算术、代数就请生产队会计来讲评工记分法。在教学方法上废除了“注入式”“填鸭式”，采用了“启发式”，多开讨论会、讲用会，同时开展师生互教互学，废除“一言堂”，坚持“群言堂”。学生反映，这样教学，学得深，学得活，记得牢，用得上。贫下中农反映，这样培养学生，回到农村真正管用。
    四、坚持生产劳动。他们遵循毛主席教育必须同生产劳动相结合的指示，按照贫下中农的意见，学校建立了师生参加生产劳动的制度，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。学校除了根据挂钩的生产队需要，有计划地经常组织师生下乡参加劳动外，还在学校周围开荒种菜、种玉米，自己养猪，使全校师生每天都能参加一些生产劳动。师生们与贫下中农一道劳动，学会了整地、播种、掌犁、施肥、种菜等基本农活，部分学生成了生产能手。坚持参加生产劳动，师生们晒黑了皮肤，炼红了思想，锤炼了对毛主席的忠心，和贫下中农的心贴得更紧了。贫下中农赞扬说，瑶族中学培养的学生觉悟高，有文化，爱劳动，有这样的接班人，我们放心了。
