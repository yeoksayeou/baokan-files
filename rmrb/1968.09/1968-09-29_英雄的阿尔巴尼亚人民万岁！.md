Just as our people are celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with great joy, and celebrating the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, a delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku from the Party and government of Albania has come to our country at our invitation. This is a double joy and a great encouragement and support for the Chinese people who are striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The members of the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune are overjoyed to hear this news and extend their warmest welcome!

Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have been waging a heroic struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. The Albanian people are fearless, daring to defy heaven and earth, and have repeatedly foiled the plots of the Soviet revisionist clique to control and subvert Albania. They have given the Soviet revisionist clique, which leads modern revisionism, a merciless exposure and blow. No threats or intimidation can make the heroic Albanian people yield. They stand firmly at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, growing stronger with each battle. Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique, under the pretext of the Warsaw Pact, gathered a group of lackeys to invade Czechoslovakia, leaving them in a dilemma and in a state of utter chaos. At this very moment, the People's Republic of Albania declared in a voice of steel to the world: withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact! This daring revolutionary action by the Albanian people has given the Soviet revisionist clique a heavy blow, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampening the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. The great socialist beacon in Europe shines even brighter and more radiantly.

The revolutionary enthusiasm of the Albanian people is surging. With one hand holding a pickaxe and the other a gun, they are building and defending their socialist homeland. In Albania, a profound socialist revolutionary movement is underway. Currently, the Albanian people, following the instructions of the great leader Enver Hoxha on educational revolution and worker supervision, are advancing the revolutionary movement. The Albanian people are fighting against nature and the elements, overcoming harsh winters and earthquakes, reclaiming grain from barren mountains, and achieving a bumper harvest of wheat. They have also successfully completed their industrial production tasks. The Chinese people are overjoyed by every victory achieved by their Albanian brothers in revolution and production and are determined to learn from them.

The fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and forged in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. This great proletarian revolutionary friendship can withstand any test.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

The great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, has pointed out: "China and Albania are forever united. They stand together to bravely fight against imperialism and revisionism, defend Marxism-Leninism, and strive for the victory of Marxism-Leninism. In the future, they will also fight side by side, achieve new victories together, and make contributions to the great cause of communism that unites us and all proletarians and revolutionary people."

Currently, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. The struggle of the revolutionary people of the world is surging. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are in trouble both internally and externally, like autumn locusts that have only a few days left to jump. Of course, all reactionaries will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage; they will inevitably make desperate struggles. However, this is futile. The truly powerful force is the people of all countries, not the reactionaries. The heroic Albanian people are invincible. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, stand firmly with the Albanian people. All the demons and monsters that dare to collide with the red socialist fortress in Europe will surely be smashed to pieces and reduced to dust!

    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    中阿友好人民公社革命委员会
    正当我国人民举国欢腾迎接国庆十九周年，庆祝全国山河一片红的大喜日子里，以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团不远万里应邀来到我国访问。这真是喜上加喜，这是对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民极大的鼓舞和支持。我们中阿友好人民公社的社员听到这一喜讯，打心眼里感到高兴，并表示最热烈的欢迎！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，高举马克思列宁主义红旗，同帝修反进行了英勇的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕。他们一次又一次地粉碎了苏修叛徒集团妄图控制、颠覆的阴谋，并且给以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义以无情的揭露和打击。任何威胁恐吓都不能使英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民屈服。他们坚定地站在反帝反修斗争的前哨，越战越强。最近，苏修叛徒集团打着华沙条约的幌子，纠集一伙娄罗侵占捷克斯洛伐克，搞得进退维谷，狼狈不堪。就在这个时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国用钢铁般的声音向全世界宣告：退出华沙条约！阿尔巴尼亚人民这一大无畏的革命行动，给了苏修叛徒集团狠狠一棒，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风。欧洲的这一盏伟大的社会主义明灯更加光辉灿烂，光芒万丈。
    革命干劲冲天的阿尔巴尼亚人民一手拿镐，一手拿枪，建设和保卫着社会主义祖国。阿尔巴尼亚国内，正在开展一场具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动。目前，阿尔巴尼亚人民正遵照伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志提出的教育革命和工人阶级监督的指示，把革命化运动推向前进。阿尔巴尼亚人民与天斗，与地斗，战胜了风雪严寒和地震，向荒山要粮，夺取了小麦的大面积丰收，并且胜利完成工业生产任务。中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚兄弟在革命和生产上取得的每一个胜利感到万分的高兴，并决心向阿尔巴尼亚兄弟学习。
    中阿两国人民之间的战斗友谊是在马克思列宁主义基础上建立起来的，是在同帝修反斗争中建立起来的。这种伟大的无产阶级革命友谊是经得起任何考验的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志指出：“中国和阿尔巴尼亚是永远连结在一起的。他们一起起来英勇反对帝国主义和修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义和争取马克思列宁主义的胜利，今后他们也将并肩战斗，一起取得新的胜利，一起对把我们和把所有的无产者和革命人民团结在一起的伟大的共产主义事业作出贡献。”
    目前，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始了。全世界革命人民的斗争风起云涌。美帝、苏修内外交困，就象秋后的蚂蚱一样没有几天蹦头了。当然，一切反动派都不会自行退出历史舞台，他们必然要作垂死的挣扎。但是，这完全是徒劳的。真正有力量的是各国人民，而不是反动派。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是不可战胜的。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民坚定地站在阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。一切敢于拿脑袋往欧洲红色的社会主义坚强堡垒上撞的牛鬼蛇神，必将碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨！
