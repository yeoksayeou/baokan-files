The revolutionary committee of the Wuwei Division of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau's Water and Electricity Section has fully mobilized the masses, focused on revolutionary criticism at the grassroots level, overcome the tendency to focus on exposing but not criticizing, and greatly promoted the development of the revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 31st: The revolutionary committee of the Wuwei Division of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau's Water and Electricity Section has focused on revolutionary criticism at the grassroots units and work teams, closely combining revolutionary criticism with the purification of class ranks. This has not only educated the broad masses but also smashed hidden reactionaries.

This section manages a long stretch of railway lines, with many work locations and dispersed personnel. The two power plants, five power supply areas, and ten water supply stations under this section are distributed along more than 500 kilometers of railway lines. Some grassroots units are located in deep mountains, gorges, or sparsely populated desert areas, and the production tasks are very heavy. Therefore, during a previous period, some grassroots units in this section showed signs of relaxing revolutionary criticism while carrying out the purification of class ranks. Some people thought that since the grassroots units have heavy production tasks, it is enough to expose traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. As for conducting good revolutionary criticism, that is the section's job. Thus, the tendency of "focusing on exposing but not criticizing" emerged.

After discovering these problems, seven members of the section's revolutionary committee, except for one who stayed in the office to handle daily work, all went to various points along the railway to help grassroots units hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on conducting good revolutionary criticism and purifying class ranks. They held a total of 23 such classes. Revolutionary workers participating in the study classes carried forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, combining theory with practice, seriously studying Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle and his latest instructions, linking them with the actual class struggle and personal thoughts of their units, summarizing work, checking their fighting spirit, and analyzing the situation. Through the study, revolutionary workers significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They said, "Only exposing but not criticizing is like cutting the grass but not uprooting it. This only clears the enemy organizationally but does not politically defeat the enemy; it only weeds out the poisonous weeds but does not use them to fertilize the field, using negative examples to educate the masses. Only by closely combining revolutionary criticism with the purification of class ranks and using Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and expose class enemies can we completely defeat the enemies that have been exposed and raise the class consciousness of the masses to expose all hidden class enemies." Everyone expressed their determination to firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, conduct deep and thorough revolutionary criticism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We not only need to propose tasks but also need to solve the problem of methods to complete the tasks." The revolutionary committee of the Wuwei Division's Water and Electricity Section also mobilized all revolutionary workers to think of ways and means to conduct revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently according to the specific situations of various units and closely combine it with the purification of class ranks. The revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of the masses and the specific situations of various units, adopted flexible, diverse, and small-scale methods to conduct revolutionary criticism. Previously, the section organized more large-scale criticism meetings, while grassroots units conducted fewer criticism activities, and some work teams lacked active materials. The revolutionary committee handed over the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries exposed at the section level to the grassroots units along the railway for mobile criticism, enabling the revolutionary workers of various units to combine their criticism of Liu Shaoqi with the criticism of Liu Shaoqi's agents and the bad elements they protected. Some grassroots units had a high turnover of workers, often working in groups of three or five along the railway lines. For such units, workers were organized into several criticism groups, and production and revolution were arranged together, with the criticism groups as combat units, holding two criticism meetings per week on-site. This changed the previous situation where criticism was conducted when there were many people and stopped when there were few.

Due to the extensive holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the masses were raised, and methods suitable for the specific situations of various units were adopted. The revolutionary criticism in this section was conducted deeply and persistently. Along the more than 500-kilometer railway line, wherever there were people working, there was the fiery revolutionary criticism; wherever there were people living, there was the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. The families and children of all workers in the section also joined the revolutionary criticism battle, making the class enemies sink into the vast sea of mass struggle.

The victories achieved in revolutionary criticism and the purification of class ranks greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The revolution and production in this section both presented a prosperous scene, and all production tasks were completed excellently every month.

    把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来
    兰州铁路局武威分局水电段革委会，充分发动群众，狠抓基层单位革命大批判，克服“重揪不重批”的倾向，大大促进了革命和生产的发展
    据新华社兰州三十一日电　兰州铁路局武威分局水电段革命委员会狠抓基层单位和班组的革命大批判，把革命大批判与清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，既教育了广大群众，又粉碎了暗藏的反动派。
    这个段所管线路长，工作地点多，人员居住分散。全段所属的两个发电厂、五个电力工区和十个给水所，分布在五百多公里的铁路沿线，其中有些基层单位在深山峡谷地带或人烟稀少的戈壁滩上，生产任务又十分繁重。因此，前一个时期，这个段在开展清理阶级队伍的工作中，有的基层单位出现了放松革命大批判的现象。有的人认为，基层单位生产任务重，只要把叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子挖出来就行了，至于搞好革命大批判，那是段上的事，因此产生了“重揪不重批”的倾向。
    段革委会发现这些问题后，七名领导成员除留一人在机关坚持日常工作外，其余六人都分别到铁路沿线，帮助基层单位大办以搞好革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。他们先后举办了二十三期毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的革命职工发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，认真学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和毛主席的一系列最新指示，联系本单位阶级斗争和个人思想的实际，总结工作，检查斗志，分析形势。通过学习，革命职工大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们说，只揪不批，等于斩草不除根，那只是在组织上清除了敌人，没有在政治上打倒敌人；只是除了毒草，没有用毒草肥田，利用反面教员教育群众。只有把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，用毛泽东思想把阶级敌人批深批臭，才能把已经挖出的敌人彻底打倒，才能提高群众的阶级觉悟，挖出一切暗藏的阶级敌人。大家表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命大批判搞深搞透，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。”武威分局水电段革委会还发动广大革命职工，人人出主意想办法，如何根据各单位的具体情况，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，并且和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来。革委会根据群众的意见和各单位的具体情况，采取了小型、多样、灵活的开展革命大批判的方法。原来段上组织大型批判会多，基层单位开展大批判活动少，有些班组没有活材料，革委会就把段级单位揪出的叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派等反革命分子，交给铁路沿线的基层单位，进行巡回批判，使各单位的革命职工把对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判同批判中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人和批斗他们包庇的坏人结合起来。有的基层单位，工人流动性大，经常三人一组、五人一班去铁路沿线分散劳动。对这样的单位，就把工人组织成几个大批判组，把革命和生产作统一安排，以大批判组为战斗单位，坚持每周在现场举行两次批判会。这样就改变了前一段人多就搞大批判，人少就停顿的状况。
    由于大办毛泽东思想学习班，提高了群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，又采取了适合于各单位具体情况的方法，这个段的革命大批判搞得又深入又持久。沿铁路线五百多公里，那里有人劳动，那里就有革命大批判的烈火；那里有人居住，那里就有革命大批判的战场。全段的职工家属、儿童也都投入了革命大批判的战斗，使阶级敌人陷入了群众斗争的汪洋大海。
    革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作所取得的胜利，大大激发了群众的革命干劲。这个段的革命、生产都呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象，各项生产任务月月都完成得很出色。
