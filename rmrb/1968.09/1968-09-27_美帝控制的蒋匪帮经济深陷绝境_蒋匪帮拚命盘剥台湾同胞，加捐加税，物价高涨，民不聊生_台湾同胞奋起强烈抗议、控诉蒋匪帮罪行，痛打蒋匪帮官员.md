The economy of the Chiang bandits, directly controlled by the U.S. imperialists, is in deep crisis. In order to make up for their huge fiscal deficit and save their doomed fate, the Chiang bandits have been frantically imposing additional levies and taxes, issuing public bonds, and ruthlessly exploiting the Taiwanese people, causing prices to soar to unprecedented levels and plunging the people into a state of misery.

According to Taiwanese newspapers, in the fiscal year 1968 (July 1967 to June 1968), the Chiang bandits extorted 10.41 billion Taiwanese dollars from the Taiwanese people through various taxes. It is reported that, under the instructions of their American masters, the Chiang bandits have been continually revising the "taxation regulations" and increasing tax rates, expanding the scope of taxation. In July of this year, the U.S. imperialists sent a veteran tax expert from the U.S., Margery, to Taiwan to manipulate the Chiang bandits in revising the "taxation regulations" once again. Under the direct planning of the U.S. invaders, various tax rates in Taiwan have all increased significantly. The land tax has increased by more than tenfold, and the property tax for the first quarter of this year has surged by ninefold compared to the same period last year. The U.S.-Chiang bandits have also raised the tuition fees for various schools by more than threefold. College students have to pay over a thousand Taiwanese dollars per semester, with the highest reaching seven thousand dollars, while the average monthly salary of a mid-level public servant in Taiwan is only a few hundred dollars. At the same time, the U.S.-Chiang bandits have added many new tax items, exploiting the Taiwanese people in every possible way, even imposing inheritance tax on newborns who die on the same day they are born. The Chiang bandits have recently passed a "Temporary Regulation on Strengthening Tax Collection," expanding the authority of the tax department and intensifying their plunder of the Taiwanese people.

In addition to using taxation to exploit the Taiwanese people, the Chiang bandits have also been issuing paper currency and forcibly issuing public bonds. It is reported that the Chiang bandits issued three billion Taiwanese dollars in paper currency in August alone, and the amount of public bonds issued has been increasing year by year. Last fiscal year, they issued 30 billion Taiwanese dollars in public bonds. In the fiscal year 1969, they issued 30 billion Taiwanese dollars in national bonds, 26.5 billion Taiwanese dollars in grain real estate bonds, and 1.5 billion Taiwanese dollars in land bonds, totaling 58 billion Taiwanese dollars, nearly doubling the amount from the previous year and accounting for more than 30% of the Chiang bandits' annual budget. Just these three types of bonds, the Chiang bandits will extort approximately 450 Taiwanese dollars from each Taiwanese person this year. Taiwanese newspapers have had to admit that the number and amount of public bonds issued by the Chiang bandits this year are unprecedented.

Due to the heavy taxation and exploitation by the U.S.-Chiang bandits, prices of various goods in Taiwan have been soaring. According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, in the past two months, the price increases in Taiwan have reached an astonishing level, unprecedented since the U.S.-Chiang bandits occupied Taiwan. It is reported that general prices have increased by 30% to 40%, and the prices of necessities have surged even more dramatically. The Chiang bandits' Central Daily News recently admitted that the price of pork in Taiwan has been increasing by an average of 50 cents to one Taiwanese dollar per day; two months ago, a pound of bok choy cost 2.50 Taiwanese dollars, but now it costs 8 to 10 Taiwanese dollars or more, a three to fourfold increase. With the sharp rise in land prices, housing prices have also increased by 30%, and construction materials by 50%. Bus fares have also increased by half. Additionally, in order to provide a "guarantee" to the U.S.-controlled "World Bank" for repaying loans and interest, the Chiang bandits, disregarding the opposition of the Taiwanese people, raised the freight rates for railway cargo by 35%. Taiwanese newspapers report that prices are still continuing to rise.

Under these conditions of soaring prices, the broad masses of Taiwanese people are struggling on the brink of starvation, and their lives are becoming more and more miserable. In Taiwanese newspapers, it is not uncommon to see news of Taiwanese people selling their children or blood to make a living. It is reported that every day, there are many people queuing up in front of hospitals in Taiwan to sell their blood. Retired soldier Yuan Dengxiang, driven by life's hardships, asked someone to place an advertisement to sell his three biological children.

Where there is oppression and exploitation, there is resistance. Recently, incidents of Taiwanese people protesting against the Chiang bandits, denouncing their crimes, and beating Chiang bandits' officials have been occurring frequently. It is reported that students from all universities and colleges in Taiwan have jointly submitted a strong protest to the Chiang bandits, demanding the abolition of various taxes on universities and colleges. More than 50 tricycle workers in Kaohsiung City stormed into the "mayor's" office, surrounding Mayor Yang Jinhu and exposing his crimes, engaging in a resolute struggle with him. The Chiang bandits hurriedly dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress the protest, and Yang Jinhu was only able to escape the danger.

    美帝控制的蒋匪帮经济深陷绝境
    蒋匪帮拚命盘剥台湾同胞，加捐加税，物价高涨，民不聊生
    台湾同胞奋起强烈抗议、控诉蒋匪帮罪行，痛打蒋匪帮官员
    据新华社二十六日讯　在美国严重经济危机的影响下，美帝国主义直接控制的蒋匪帮经济正深陷绝境。蒋匪帮为了弥补庞大的财政赤字，挽救它行将灭亡的命运，最近拚命地加捐加税，摊派“公债”，敲骨吸髓地盘剥台湾同胞，使台湾物价空前高涨，人民处于水深火热之中。
    据台湾报纸透露，仅一九六八年度（一九六七年七月——一九六八年六月），蒋匪帮通过苛捐杂税从台湾同胞身上榨取了一百零四亿一千多万元（台币，下同）。据报道，蒋匪帮在它的美国主子的指使下，不断地修正“税收条例”，提高税率，扩大课征范围。今年七月间，美帝国主义派遣搜刮美国人民的老手美国税收“专家”马葛雷到台湾，操纵蒋匪帮再次修正“税收条例”。在美国侵略者的直接策划下，台湾各种税率无不大幅度地增加。地价税提高十多倍，房屋税今年度第一季度比去年度猛增九倍。美蒋匪帮最近还把各类学校的学费提高三倍多，大专院校学生每学期交学费一千多元，最高达七千元之多，而台湾一般中层公教人员，每月薪水只有几百元。同时，美蒋匪帮还增加了许多新的税目，无孔不入地进行搜刮，就连刚出生的婴儿当天死亡也要征收遗产税。蒋匪帮最近又通过了一个“加强税捐征收暂时条例”，扩大税务部门的“权限”，加紧对台湾同胞的强取豪夺。
    蒋匪帮除了利用税收搜刮台湾同胞外，还滥发纸币，强行摊派“公债”。据报道，蒋匪帮仅八月份就发行纸币三亿元，“公债”也一年比一年增加。去年度发行“公债”三十亿元。一九六九年度发行“国债”三十亿元，“粮食实物债券”二十六亿五千万元，“土地债券”一亿五千万元，共达五十八亿元，比去年度增加将近一倍，占蒋匪帮全年“预算”的百分之三十以上。仅这三种“公债”，蒋匪帮今年就要从每个台湾同胞身上榨取约四百五十元。台湾报纸也不得不承认，蒋匪帮在本年度发行“公债”的种类之多，金额之大，是空前未有的。
    由于美蒋匪帮横征暴敛，台湾各种物价纷纷飞涨。据台湾报纸报道，近两个月来，台湾物价涨幅达到惊人的地步，为美蒋匪帮窃据台湾以来所仅见。报道说，一般物价普遍上涨百分之三十到四十，生活必需品则上涨更为剧烈。蒋匪帮《中央日报》最近供认，台湾猪肉几乎每天平均上涨五角到一元；小白菜两个月前每斤二元五角，现在每斤八元至十元以上，猛涨三到四倍，许多人每天的全部收入还不够买一斤小白菜。随着地价的猛涨，房价也跟着上涨百分之三十，建筑材料上涨百分之五十。公共汽车票价也一口气上涨了一半。另外蒋匪帮为向美国控制的“世界银行”提供偿还贷款本息的“保证”，不顾台湾同胞的反对，把铁路货运费提高了百分之三十五。台湾报纸报道，目前物价仍在继续上涨。
    在这种物价飞涨的情况下，广大台湾同胞挣扎在饥饿线上，生活愈来愈悲惨。在台湾报上，经常可以看到台湾同胞靠卖儿卖女或卖血为生的社会新闻。据报道，台湾医院门前每天都有许多人排队卖血。退役蒋军阮登祥为生活所迫，托人登报转让他三个亲生儿女。
    那里有压迫、有剥削，那里就有反抗。最近，台湾同胞向蒋匪帮提出抗议、控诉蒋匪帮罪行和殴打蒋匪帮官员的事件不断发生。据报道，全台湾省的大专院校学生联名向蒋匪帮提出强烈抗议，要求取消对大专院校的各种捐税。高雄市五十多个三轮车工人浩浩荡荡冲进“市长”室，将“市长”杨金虎团团围住，揭露他的罪行，同他进行坚决斗争。蒋匪帮慌忙派出大批武装警察前往镇压，杨金虎才脱离险境。
