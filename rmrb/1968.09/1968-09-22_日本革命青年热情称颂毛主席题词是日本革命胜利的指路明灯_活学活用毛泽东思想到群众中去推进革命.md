Japanese revolutionary youths are greatly inspired by the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese workers six years ago. They have expressed their views, emphasizing the need to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution, and to advance the revolution of the Japanese people.

In Tokyo, revolutionary youth Yamamoto Yoichi said passionately: "Chairman Mao's inscription is the beacon for the victory of the Japanese revolution, and the guiding principle for solving various problems on the path of the Japanese revolutionary struggle. The publication of Chairman Mao's inscription and the editorial of the People's Daily at this time of surging revolutionary struggle among the Japanese people is the greatest support and encouragement for the Japanese people."

Yamamoto stressed that without participating in the fiery mass struggle, one cannot uphold the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, let alone fully combine these universal truths with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution. He said: "Go to the masses, learn well from the masses, fully mobilize the masses to develop the revolutionary struggle, this is the guarantee to defeat the enemy and achieve victory."

Yamamoto said: "We must more seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, persist in placing ourselves in the midst of the mass struggle, and vigorously promote self-reliance, solving various difficulties that arise in the development of the mass struggle. To live up to the support and encouragement of the seven hundred million Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely solve a series of strategic and tactical problems and continue to advance the revolutionary struggle."

Japanese revolutionary youth Yamada Seishi, who has been fighting alongside the farmers of Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka against the construction of an airport by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, said that Chairman Mao's inscription points out the path to victory for the Japanese revolution, causing the revisionist group led by Kyuzo Nonomura of the Japanese Communist Party to panic. This clearly shows the great revolutionary power of Chairman Mao's inscription. He said: "The struggle in Sanrizuka has taught us that only by adhering to the principle of violent revolution of Marxism-Leninism can our struggle develop and achieve final victory."

Yamada said: "We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, more seriously apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific practices of the revolutionary struggle, to solve the many problems before us, and continuously advance the Japanese revolution."

Representative Kitaura Kazuo of the Mao Zedong Thought Youth and Student Joint Conference said that young people and students enthusiastically welcome the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese workers, and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and strive to complete the tasks of the Japanese revolution.

He said, the revolutionary people of Japan deeply understand the importance of the call by the great leader Chairman Mao to "combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution." We must be determined, fear no sacrifice, and throw ourselves into the fiery revolution of Japan, using the "arrow" of Marxism-Leninism to hit the "target" of the Japanese revolution.

    日本革命青年热情称颂毛主席题词是日本革命胜利的指路明灯
    活学活用毛泽东思想到群众中去推进革命
    据新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：伟大领袖毛主席六年前给日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表，使日本革命青年极为振奋。他们纷纷发表谈话，强调在群众斗争中把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同日本革命的具体实践相结合，把日本人民的革命推向前进。
    东京革命青年山本阳一满怀激情地说：“毛主席的题词是日本革命胜利的指路明灯，是解决日本革命斗争前进道路上所面临的各种问题的指针。毛主席的题词和《人民日报》的社论在现在日本人民的革命斗争蓬勃高涨的时候发表，是对日本人民最大的支持和鼓舞。”
    山本强调说，不投入火热的群众斗争中，就不能坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，更不能把这一普遍真理同日本革命的具体实践完全结合。他说：“到群众中去，好好向群众学习，充分发动群众从而发展革命斗争，这就是打倒敌人，赢得胜利的保证。”
    山本说：“我们必须更加认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持把我们自己置于群众斗争之中，大力发扬自力更生的作风，自己解决在群众斗争的发展过程中产生的各种难题。为了不辜负毛主席领导下的七亿中国人民的支持和鼓励，我们定将解决一系列战略和策略的问题，继续把革命斗争向前推进。”
    坚持同千叶县三里塚农民一道进行反对美日反动派修建机场斗争的日本革命青年山田精市说，毛主席的题词指出了日本革命走向胜利的道路，使日共宫本修正主义集团惊慌失措。这清楚表明毛主席的题词具有极为伟大的革命力量。他说：“三里塚的斗争教育了我们，只有坚持遵循马克思列宁主义的暴力革命原则，我们的斗争才会发展并赢得最后胜利。”
    山田说：“我们要遵循毛主席的教导，更认真地把马克思列宁主义运用于革命斗争的具体实践，来解决摆在我们面前的许多问题，把日本的革命不断推向前进。”
    毛泽东思想青年、学生共同会议代表北原一夫说，我们青年和学生热烈欢呼世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席给日本工人朋友们的重要题词的发表，并且决心遵照毛主席的教导，努力完成日本革命的任务。
    他说，日本革命人民深深地体会到伟大领袖毛主席号召的“马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合”的重要意义。我们一定下定决心，不怕牺牲，投身到日本革命的烈火中去，用马克思列宁主义的“矢”去射日本革命之“的”。
