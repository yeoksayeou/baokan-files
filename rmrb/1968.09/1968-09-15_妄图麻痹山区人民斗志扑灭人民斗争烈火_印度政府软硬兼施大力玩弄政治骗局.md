    While intensifying military suppression against the people of the eastern mountainous regions, the Indian government announced the establishment of a mere nominal "autonomous state" to deceive the people.

    New Delhi, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) — Recently, the Indian reactionary government, while further intensifying military suppression against the people of the eastern mountainous regions of India, has been intensifying political deception in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the national liberation struggle in that region.

    According to reports, the Indian government announced on Sept. 11 a decision to establish a new "autonomous state" in the mountainous areas within Assam. This is a political trick played by the Indian reactionary government under the pretext of "satisfying" the demands of the mountainous people for national liberation. In reality, it is aimed at numbing the fighting spirit of the people of the eastern mountainous regions. This so-called "autonomous state" is merely a hollow name. It has no real power and is still under the strict control of the Assam reactionary authorities. It has the same capital, the same governor, and the same high court as Assam.

    For a long time, the people of the eastern mountainous regions of India have been waging a tenacious struggle against the oppression of the Indian reactionary government and for national liberation. The military suppression carried out by the Indian reactionary government against the people there has all ended in failure. It is precisely in this situation that the head of the Indian reactionary government, Indira Gandhi, personally proposed the establishment of such an "autonomous state." This counter-revolutionary scheme, as soon as it was hatched, immediately received the support and praise of the Indian revisionists, who hailed it as a means of "satisfying" the wishes of the mountainous people. The Indian revisionists' behavior of cheering for the reactionaries once again exposed their traitorous true colors. At the same time as this decision was announced, the Indian reactionary government is intensifying military deployments in the eastern mountainous regions and preparing to further suppress the people there with armed force. According to the British Daily Telegraph, the Indian reactionary army is about to launch a "search and annihilation" military operation to suppress the people there, and has ordered the reactionary army in the border areas to "shoot on sight." Indian bourgeois newspapers also revealed that the Indian reactionary government has ordered the army to surround the Manipur region adjacent to Assam and prohibit people outside the region from entering its encirclement.

    The struggle of the people of eastern India against the tyranny and national oppression of the Indian government is just. No matter whether the Indian reactionary government uses political deception or military suppression, it will never be able to crush the people's determination to seek liberation. The struggle of the people of eastern India will certainly achieve final victory.

    妄图麻痹山区人民斗志扑灭人民斗争烈火
    印度政府软硬兼施大力玩弄政治骗局
    在对东部山区人民加紧镇压同时，宣布成立徒具虚名的“自治邦”进行欺骗
    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：最近，印度反动政府在进一步对印度东部山区人民进行军事镇压的同时，加紧玩弄政治欺骗，企图扑灭这个地区的民族解放斗争的烈火。
    据报道，印度政府十一日宣布一项决定，将在阿萨姆邦内的山区新成立一个“自治邦”。这是印度反动政府打着“满足”山区人民要求民族解放的愿望的幌子，实际上是为了麻痹东部山区人民的斗志而玩弄的一个政治骗局。这个所谓的“自治邦”徒具虚名，它没有任何实际权力，仍旧在阿萨姆反动当局的严密的控制之下，它和阿萨姆邦同一个首府，同一个邦长，同一个高等法院。
    长期以来，印度东部山区人民一直在为反抗印度反动政府的压迫，争取民族解放，进行着坚韧不拔的斗争，印度反动政府对那里的人民进行的军事镇压都遭到了失败。正是在这样的情况下，印度反动政府头目英迪拉·甘地亲自提出了成立这样的一个“自治邦”的方案。这个反革命的方案一出笼就立即得到印度修正主义分子的支持和赞扬，被他们吹捧为这是能够“满足”山区人民的“愿望”的。印度修正主义分子这种为反动派摇旗呐喊的行径又一次暴露了它的叛徒真面目。在宣布这个决定的同时，印度反动政府正在东部山区加紧军事部署，准备对东部山区人民进一步进行武装镇压。据英国《每日电讯》透露，印度反动军队即将发动一个“搜查和歼灭性”的军事行动来镇压那里的人民，并且已命令在边境地区的反动军队“见到人就射击”。印度资产阶级报纸也透露，印度反动政府已经下令军队包围同阿萨姆邦相邻的曼尼普尔地区，禁止这个地区以外的人进入它的包围圈。
    印度东部人民反对印度政府暴政和民族压迫的斗争是正义的，不管印度反动政府采取政治欺骗还是军事镇压，都绝对压不倒人民要求解放的决心，印度东部人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
