The broad masses of pastoralists in Xinjiang's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They have overcome natural disasters and achieved seven consecutive years of increased livestock production. This is a scene of Kazakh pastoralists from the Third Brigade of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Tekes County shearing sheep.
