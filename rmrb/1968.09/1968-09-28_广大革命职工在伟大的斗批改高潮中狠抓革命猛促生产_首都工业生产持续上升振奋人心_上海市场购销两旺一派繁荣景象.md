Inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the 700,000 industrial workers in the capital, who are fighting alongside Chairman Mao, are filled with enthusiasm and high morale. The tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production is surging higher and higher, and inspiring reports of victories are frequently coming in.

Since March, industrial production in the capital has steadily and continuously increased. The total industrial output in the second quarter was 37.4% higher than in the first quarter. In the hot and rainy months of July and August, production levels not only did not decline but also increased month by month, even as a large number of excellent workers were sent to various fields of the superstructure to participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, leaving fewer workers in the factories. July's production was 12% higher than June's, and August's was 13% higher than July's. In eight local industrial systems, including machinery, instruments and meters, textiles, and light industry, historical high monthly production levels were achieved. In the first half of September, industrial production in the city continued to rise, with significant increases in the production of important products such as steel, steel products, pig iron, raw coal, electric motors, fertilizers, pesticides, and cotton yarn compared to the same period last month.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's teachings have greatly inspired the working class in the capital. While sending excellent workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools and various fields of the superstructure, they are also actively carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Currently, revolutionary committees have been established in all central and municipal industrial and mining enterprises in the city. The revolutionary criticism and struggle is being carried out extensively, deeply, and persistently, with production teams as the base, purging the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and breaking down various unreasonable rules and regulations that bind the initiative and creativity of the workers. The work of cleaning up the class ranks is developing in depth, and the broad revolutionary masses are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uncovering hidden class enemies, and achieving great results. The work of rectifying the party and streamlining the organization is gradually being carried out, and the new revolutionary committees in industrial and mining enterprises are striding forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao: "Organize a revolutionary leading cadre team that is connected with the masses." The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, a model of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are once again at the forefront of the city's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In the process of struggle, criticism, and transformation, in the advanced factories where the masses have been fully mobilized, technical innovation and technological revolution activities are booming. The Beijing Transformer Factory successfully developed advanced silicon rectifier components and rectifier devices in just three months. The workers and technical personnel of the Beijing Third Rolling Mill and the design and research units in Beijing, Xi'an, and Luoyang worked closely together to successfully convert a four-roll rolling mill into an eight-roll rolling mill. The original strip steel could only be rolled to a thickness of 0.1 millimeters, but now it can be rolled to 0.025 millimeters, reducing the number of rolling passes by half, greatly shortening the production cycle and reducing coal and electricity consumption, and increasing production efficiency by 60%.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the eve of National Day, Shanghai's market saw a boom in both sales and purchases, with ample stockpiles, good supply conditions, and stable prices. This is the result of the broad revolutionary masses on all fronts seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and seizing the revolution and promoting production in the great struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Currently, Shanghai's market is bustling with a vibrant and prosperous scene. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, vegetables, and other foodstuffs are abundant and well-supplied. Seasonal fruits like pears and apples are in large quantities, significantly more than last year. Cotton fabric stores have a variety of deep-colored khaki, wool, and other fabrics for the autumn and winter seasons, with ample stock and a variety of colors and styles. According to statistics from relevant departments, due to the consecutive bumper harvests of summer and early autumn crops this year, the supply of agricultural and sideline products has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. The daily industrial products purchased by Shanghai's commercial departments have been on the rise since March this year, with a significant increase in the purchase of cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, and chemical fiber textiles in July and August compared to the same period last year. There has also been a different degree of increase in sewing machines, watches, and bicycles. The prosperity of Shanghai's market reflects the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and fully proves that "the proletarian cultural revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country."

The proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses on the financial and commercial front in Shanghai, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are firmly grasping class struggle and not letting up, continuously improving their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the struggle, launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and promoting the development of market work. The proletarian revolutionary factions on the financial and commercial front, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions throughout the city, have severely cracked down on speculation and profiteering activities, safeguarding the socialist economy and ensuring the normal supply of the market.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of who serves whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." The broad revolutionary masses on the financial and commercial front in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people," have reasonably arranged business hours to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some so-called "high-level restaurants" and "specialty stores" that were detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers have changed their business direction in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, shifting their focus to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wholesale departments have also increased the allocation of goods to factories and rural areas, allowing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to conveniently purchase the goods they need.

    广大革命职工在伟大的斗批改高潮中狠抓革命猛促生产
    首都工业生产持续上升振奋人心
    上海市场购销两旺一派繁荣景象
    据新华社二十五日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，战斗在毛主席身边的首都七十万产业工人激情满怀，斗志昂扬。抓革命、促生产的热潮一浪高过一浪，振奋人心的捷报频频传来。
    从三月份以来，首都工业生产稳步持续上升。第二季度工业生产总值比第一季度提高百分之三十七点四。在高温多雨的七、八月份，生产水平不但没有下降，而且在陆续抽调大批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队到上层建筑各个领域参加斗、批、改，留厂人员减少的情况下，生产逐月提高，七月比六月、八月比七月分别提高百分之十二和百分之十三。八个地方工业系统中，机械、仪器仪表、纺织和轻工业等，都创造了历史最高月产水平。九月上中旬，全市工业生产继续上升，钢、钢材、生铁、原煤、电动机、化肥、农药、棉纱等重要产品的产量比上月同期都有较大增长。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的教导给首都工人阶级以极大鼓舞。他们在派出优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，参加学校和上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改的同时，积极搞好本单位的斗、批、改，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。目前，全市中央和市属工矿企业都成立了革命委员会。革命的大批判，正以生产班组为基点，广泛、深入、持久地展开，涤荡着中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，破除束缚工人积极性、创造性的各种不合理的规章制度。清理阶级队伍的工作正在向纵深发展，广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，挖掘隐藏的阶级敌人，取得了很大成绩。整党和精简机构的工作正逐步开展，工矿企业里新生的革命委员会，正朝着毛主席指示的“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的方向阔步前进。紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的典范——北京针织总厂的革命职工，在全市斗、批、改高潮中又走在前面。
    在斗、批、改的过程中，在群众充分发动起来的一批先进工厂里，技术革新和技术革命活动搞得蓬蓬勃勃。北京变压器厂在短短三个月内就试制成功了具有先进水平的硅整流元件和整流装置。北京第三轧钢厂和北京、西安、洛阳的设计、研究单位的工人、技术人员紧密协作，成功地把一台四辊轧机改造成八辊轧机，原来轧制的带钢最薄只能达到零点一毫米，现在可以薄到零点零二五毫米，轧制道数减少一半，大大缩短了生产周期和降低了煤、电消耗，生产效率可以提高百分之六十。
    据新华社上海二十五日电　国庆节前夕，上海市场商品购销两旺，库存物资充裕，供应情况良好，物价稳定。这是各条战线的广大革命职工，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，狠抓革命、猛促生产的结果。
    当前，上海市场上到处是一派欣欣向荣的大好景象。肉类、家禽、鱼类、蛋品、蔬菜等副食品到货旺盛，供应充裕。生梨、苹果等时令水果大量上市，数量比去年大大增加。棉布店里，各种深色卡其、线呢等秋冬季节需要的棉布，备货充足，花色品种多样。据有关部门统计，由于今年农业夏熟和早秋作物连续获得丰收，农副产品的货源比去年同期显著增长。上海商业部门收购的日用工业品，自今年三月份以来直线上升，七、八月份收购的棉布、呢绒、化纤纺织品比去年同期大大增长。缝纫机、手表、自行车等商品也有不同程度的增长。上海市场的繁荣兴旺，反映了工农业生产的迅速发展，充分证明了“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    上海财贸战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，在斗争中不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮，推动了市场工作的开展。财贸战线的无产阶级革命派还同全市无产阶级革命派一起，狠狠地打击了投机倒把活动，保卫了社会主义经济，保障了市场的正常供应。
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”上海财贸战线广大革命职工遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，合理安排营业时间，更好地为工农兵服务。原来脱离工农兵群众的一些所谓“高级饭店”、“特色商店”，在斗、批、改中纷纷改变经营方向，把立足点移到为工农兵服务这方面来。批发部门还增加了对工厂和农村的货源分配，使广大工农兵群众能够就近买到需要的商品。
