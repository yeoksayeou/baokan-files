In the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the coal industry front in Heilongjiang Province has reported successes. The three mining bureaus of Shuangyashan, Jixi, and Qitaihe have all completed and exceeded the September national plan ahead of schedule.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary workers have broken through unreasonable regulations and institutions that hinder production, carried out extensive technological innovations, and continuously created new production records.

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the coal production of Kailuan Mine has been continuously increasing this year. On the basis of completing the national coal production plan for the first half of the year six days ahead of schedule, the third quarter has also completed the plan month by month, with production increasing month by month. Significant achievements have also been made in technological innovation and technological revolution.

After sending a batch of workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the remaining revolutionary workers in the Benxi Mining Bureau have bravely taken on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, making the coal production situation more prosperous. On the basis of completing the national coal production plan for the first half of the year five days ahead of schedule, the third quarter has also completed the original coal and tunneling plans thirteen and ten days ahead of schedule, respectively.

The revolutionary committee of the Hebei Fengfeng Mining Bureau has seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully playing the leading role of the working class. Since entering the third quarter, the entire bureau has completed the production tasks ahead of schedule every month, with the average daily output increased by 8.5% compared to the first half of the year. The original coal production was completed nine days ahead of schedule, and the tunneling was completed twenty-two days ahead of schedule, exceeding the national plan for the third quarter.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau in Jilin Province have been vigorously promoting production. On the basis of completing the national plan two days ahead of schedule in the first half of the year, the third quarter has completed the national original coal production plan six days ahead of schedule under the conditions of increased indicators and reduced personnel.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of the Ping'an Coal Mine in Fuxin, Liaoning, have actively participated in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, making the mine a scene of thriving revolution and production. On the basis of completing the national production plan for the first half of the year thirteen days ahead of schedule, the tunneling and coal mining have also completed the national plan for the third quarter nine and thirteen days ahead of schedule, respectively.

Under the help of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the mine, the revolutionary workers of the Tianzhong Coal Mine in the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau in Shandong have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." By September 20, the entire mine had completed 95% of the annual national coal production plan. From January to August, 87,000 tons of coal were produced for the state.

Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary workers of the Shejiaji No. 3 Mine in Huainan, Anhui, have vigorously carried out the revolutionary criticism and pushed production to develop continuously. Since May, the entire mine has completed the national plan ahead of schedule every month, maintaining stable and high production for five consecutive months. The daily coal production in August increased by 387 tons compared to May, and the daily production in the first half of September increased significantly compared to August.
