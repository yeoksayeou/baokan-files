	We Must Give Political Work a "Special" Status
		Air Force Certain Unit Flight Squadron Commander Chen Xizhi

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai, madly shouts: "We must prevent the tendency to overly emphasize the special status and special power of political work." This is a blatant opposition to our emphasis on politics, opposition to placing political work at the forefront of all work, and opposition to using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and soul of all work.

	Why does Peng Dehuai, like a bat fearing sunlight, fear our military's political work? Uncovering the truth, his evil purpose is to abolish our military's political work, abolish the Party's absolute leadership over our military, remove our military's soul, and make us deviate from proletarian politics.

	The history of our military's growth and development over the past few decades is a history of building the military with Mao Zedong Thought. From the early days of our military's establishment, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Military affairs are merely a tool for accomplishing political tasks," and "The Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." He specifically stipulated the three major tasks of combat teams, work teams, and production teams, and established a series of political military-building principles, policies, and systems, such as the system of party representatives, party branches at the company level, party committees, and political work systems. Political military-building is the core of Chairman Mao's military-building thought and the lifeblood of our military.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the command, is the soul. The relationship between politics and technology is that politics is always first, politics is always the command, politics is always the head, always leading military affairs, leading economics, leading work, leading technology. Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, we resolutely place politics at the forefront and vigorously emphasize proletarian politics. For new pilots arriving at the flight squadron, their first meal is a bitter meal; their first meeting is a bitter meeting; their first daily reading is to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune"; their first technical class is to learn how worker comrades, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, manufactured domestically produced aircraft; their first flight content is that Chairman Mao has given us wings.

	To cultivate red pilots who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we have turned the airfield into a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Before pilots get on the plane, they carry three things: Mao Zedong's instructions, heroic images, and "black targets." During flight, they treat every action as a cannon shot aimed at the Chinese Khrushchev, and every takeoff and landing as standing guard for Chairman Mao. The flight commander first transmits Mao Zedong's instructions through the radio to the sky, guiding the pilots to fly forward along the red route indicated by Chairman Mao. This is how we place political work in a "special" position, allowing political work to exert its power, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command the sky and the earth, to command every inch of our flight path, and to command everything.

	By emphasizing proletarian politics, we have liberated our minds, broken through the old frameworks of past training, and implemented large-scale interspersed training, effectively increasing the daily utilization rate of flights. In recent years, the difficulty of training subjects has increased compared to the past, but the training speed has greatly accelerated, and the flight quality is higher than at any other time. What used to take more than a year to complete can now be finished in just six months. These living proofs show: Emphasizing proletarian politics makes the sky red, the earth red, and people even redder; thought and technology both flourish. Emphasizing proletarian politics allows us to follow Chairman Mao forever and revolutionize; in storms and waves, we have direction; in the vast sky, we do not lose our way.

	Political work is about managing thoughts, managing souls, and managing revolutionization; it is the overall manager of all industries. Placing political work in what position is a struggle between two military-building lines and two military-building thoughts. Emphasizing military affairs or emphasizing politics is a crucial issue related to the survival of the state, the Party, and the regime, and related to whether the people gain everything or lose everything. We must resolutely defend and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian political military-building line, and resolutely fight to defend Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's political military-building line.

    就是要给政治工作以“特殊”
    地位空军某部飞行大队长　陈锡志
    反革命修正主义分子彭德怀，疯狂地叫嚷：“要防止不适当的强调政治工作的特殊地位和特殊权力的倾向”。这是明目张胆地反对我们突出政治，反对我们把政治工作放在一切工作的首位，反对我们把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的统帅和灵魂。
    彭德怀为什么象蝙蝠害怕阳光一样，害怕我军的政治工作呢？揭开盖子看到底，他的罪恶目的，就是要取消我军的政治工作，取消党对我军的绝对领导，抽掉我军的灵魂，使我们脱离无产阶级政治。
    我军几十年的成长壮大的历史，就是用毛泽东思想建军的历史，政治工作的发展史。远在我军初建时期，毛主席明确指出：“军事只是完成政治任务的工具”，“红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”还具体地规定了战斗队，工作队，生产队三大任务，制定了党代表制度、支部建在连上、党委制、政治工作制度等一系列的政治建军的路线、方针、原则。政治建军是毛主席建军思想的核心，是我军的命根子。
    毛主席教导我们说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治与技术的关系，政治总是第一，政治总是统帅，政治总是头，总是率领军事、率领经济、率领业务、率领技术的。遵照毛主席的伟大教导，我们坚决把政治放在首位，狠抓突出无产阶级政治。新飞行员到飞行大队的第一顿饭，就是忆苦饭；第一次会，就是忆苦会；第一次天天读，是学习《为人民服务》；第一堂技术课，是讲工人老大哥靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想制造出国产飞机；第一项飞行的内容，是毛主席给我们插上了翅膀。
    为了培养无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的红色飞行员，我们把机场变成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，斗私批修的战场。飞行员上飞机前作到三带：带毛主席指示、带英雄形象、带“黑靶”。飞行中把做好每一个动作，都当作是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一发炮弹，每完成一个起落，都看成是为毛主席站好一班岗。飞行指挥员首先把毛主席指示通过无线电传到天空，使飞行员沿着毛主席指引的红色航线飞向前方。我们就是这样，把政治工作放在“特殊”地位，让政治工作发挥威力，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅天空和大地，统帅我们的每一寸航程，统帅我们的一切。
    突出了无产阶级政治，解放了思想，打破了以往训练中的旧框框，实行大幅度穿插，有效地提高了飞行日利用率。近几年来，训练课目的难度比过去高，但训练速度都比过去大大加快了，飞行质量比以往任何时候都高。过去一年多才能完成的飞行训练任务，现只要六个月就完成了。这些活生生的事实证明：突出了无产阶级政治，天红、地红、人更红，思想技术都丰收；突出了无产阶级政治，就能紧跟毛主席，永远干革命，大风大浪里有方向，万里长空不迷航。
    政治工作就是管思想、管灵魂、管革命化的，是各行各业的总管。把政治工作放在什么位置，这是两条建军路线、两种建军思想的斗争。突出军事还是突出政治，是关系到国家的存亡，党的存亡，政权的存亡，关系到人民得到一切还是丧失一切的头等重大问题。我们要誓死捍卫、坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级政治建军路线，坚决为保卫毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的政治建军路线而战斗。
