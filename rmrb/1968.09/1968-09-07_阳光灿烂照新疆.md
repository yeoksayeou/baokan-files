The Tarm River surges with golden waves, and the Pamir Plateau echoes with new songs. The winds of Kunlun blow in gusts, and reports of victory fly over a thousand mountains and rivers. The sun shines brightly over the grasslands, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has established a Revolutionary Committee! Red flags flutter at the foot of Tian Shan, and the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang look to Chairman Mao. Red clouds float over Turpan, quickly bringing the good news to our great benefactor. The winter notla (a traditional Uygur string instrument) is played high and clear, singing joyfully: "The Revolutionary Committee is good." The radiance of the sun warms every heart, and Chairman Mao cares most for the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups. Trees grow in clusters, root to root, and the hearts of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are united. Thunder roars and lightning flashes, as the military and the people launch a great revolutionary criticism. Torches are lit and thunderous voices rise, exposing the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xinjiang. Iron arms are linked together, and the great alliance of the revolutionary masses is invincible. Rainbow-colored clouds float across the sky, and the revolutionary situation across the country is excellent. Stars align towards the Big Dipper, and the revolutionary people are determined to follow Chairman Mao. We welcome the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and vow to defend the iron-clad fortress for ten thousand years.

    阳光灿烂照新疆
    解放军总后勤部“五·七”写作组塔里木河啊涌金波，帕米尔高原传新歌。昆仑的风啊一阵阵吹，万水千山捷报飞。阳光灿烂照草原，新疆维吾尔自治区建立了革命委员会！天山脚下飘红旗，新疆各族革命人民心向毛主席。吐鲁番上空飘红云，快把喜报献给咱们的大恩人。弹起冬不拉歌儿高，纵情高唱：革命委员会好。太阳的光辉照红一颗颗心，毛主席最关怀各族革命人民。一丛丛树啊根连根，无产阶级革命派心连心。一声声霹雳一道道闪，军民开展革命大批判。一把把火炬一声声雷，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫在新疆的代理人。一双双铁臂连一起，革命派大联合威力无比。一道道彩霞漫天飘，全国革命形势无限好。一颗颗星星朝北斗，革命人民决心跟着毛主席走。迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，誓保铁打江山万年红。
