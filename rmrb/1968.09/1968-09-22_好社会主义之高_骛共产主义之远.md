The Red Flag Shipyard was once an old and dilapidated repair shop that had long been under the yoke of imperialism. After liberation, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it was reborn and its productivity rapidly developed. Especially after the great leader Chairman Mao personally formulated the Party's general line of building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and excellent work, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, decided to strive heroically to develop the shipbuilding industry, build a large number of ships, and construct a "railroad" on the sea. With sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm and fearless heroism, they used the shortest shipbuilding period in the world to build China's first ocean-going ten-thousand-ton giant ship, writing a glorious page in China's shipbuilding history. Subsequently, the first three-thousand-horsepower engine was also born. Under the impetus of the socialist revolutionary spirit, production flourished, and a prosperous and thriving scene emerged.

The rapid development of the shipbuilding industry frightened China's Khrushchev and his agents in the shipbuilding industry. Out of their reactionary class instincts, they maliciously attacked our large-scale shipbuilding industry as "aiming too high and too far," "detached from reality," and "quite blind." They even openly proposed that the shipbuilding industry should "make way." The Khrushchev clique in our factory vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Despite the resolute opposition of the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, they forcibly ordered us, a large shipyard suitable for building ten-thousand-ton ships, to produce small ships of less than a hundred tons. To meet the needs of producing small ships, they dismantled the large automatic welding platform in the hull workshop, stopped the electric slag welding equipment, and reduced the size of the large machine tools. The large shipbuilding platform was filled with small ships. This is like using an anti-aircraft gun to shoot a mosquito or using a butcher's knife to kill a chicken. It is an attempt to drag us backward and strangle the rapid development of our shipbuilding industry. This is another crime of China's Khrushchev in his mad opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it must be thoroughly settled.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seized back the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers of the Red Flag Shipyard, and put them in our own hands. Now we have started producing ten-thousand-ton giant ships again. We, the working class, must aim high for socialism and strive far for communism! We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced level," to redouble our revolutionary efforts, to make up for the time delayed by the interference of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and to strive forward courageously to build a large number of ships and construct a "railroad" on the sea!

### 好社会主义之高　骛共产主义之远

    好社会主义之高　骛共产主义之远
    国防工业毛泽东思想学习班老工人　苏廷文
    红旗造船厂过去是一个长期受帝国主义奴役的破旧古老的修船工厂。解放后，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下获得了新生，生产力得到了迅速发展。特别是在伟大领袖毛主席亲自制定了党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线以后，全厂革命职工在大跃进的高潮中，决心为大搞造船工业，大量造船，建设海上“铁路”而英勇奋斗。他们以冲天的革命热情，大无畏的英雄气概，用世界上最短的船台周期，造出了我国第一艘远洋万吨巨轮，为我国造船史写下了光辉的一页。接着，三千马力大机也首次问世。在社会主义革命精神的带动下，生产蒸蒸日上，出现了一片欣欣向荣的大好局面。
    造船工业的大发展，吓坏了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在造船工业的代理人，出于他们的反动阶级本能，恶毒攻击我们大搞造船工业是什么“好高骛远”、“脱离实际”、“带有相当的盲目性”。甚至公然提出要造船工业“让路”。中国赫鲁晓夫之流在我厂竭力推行反革命修正主义路线，他们不顾全厂革命职工的坚决反对，强行下令叫我们这样一个适合造万吨级以上船舶的大厂，生产一些不上百吨的小船。他们为了适应生产小船的需要，把造体车间的大型自动焊接平台拆毁了，电渣焊接设备停工了，大型机床改小了。大船台上摆满了小船。这简直是用高射炮打蚊子，用牛刀杀鸡，是要把我们拉向倒退，扼杀我们造船工业的迅猛发展。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一个罪证，必须彻底清算。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂无产阶级革命派造了党内一小撮走资派的反，把红旗造船厂的党政财文大权夺回自己的手中。现在我们又开始生产万吨巨轮了，我们工人阶级就是要好社会主义之高，骛共产主义之远！我们决心遵循毛主席的“赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，鼓足革命干劲，把由于反革命修正主义路线的干扰而拖延下来的时间抢回来，为大量造船，建立海上“铁路”而奋勇前进！
