Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Inspection of Wuhan Steel

Over the past ten years, the broad masses of industrial workers at Wuhan Steel, following the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao, have achieved one victory after another in the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 17th — In the midst of the excellent situation where the whole country is red, the 50,000 revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel Company, filled with the joy of victory, held a grand meeting to enthusiastically celebrate the 10th anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Wuhan Steel.

Wuhan Steel is one of the important steel industrial bases in our country, bearing the important task of supporting the socialist construction and national defense construction of the motherland. Our great leader Chairman Mao has given it the utmost care and guidance from its construction to its production.

September 13, 1958, is the most glorious, happiest, and most unforgettable day in the history of Wuhan Steel. On this day, our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Wuhan Steel and gave extremely important instructions. Chairman Mao said: "For large-scale enterprises like Wuhan Steel, we can gradually develop them into comprehensive integrated enterprises. Apart from producing various steel products, we should also engage in mechanical engineering, chemical industry, and construction industry, etc."

Over the past ten years, the broad masses of industrial workers at Wuhan Steel, following the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao, have broken through numerous difficulties and made great strides forward on the path of socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving one victory after another. Since 1958, while producing steel products, Wuhan Steel's mechanical engineering, chemical industry, and construction industry have all developed significantly. The revolutionary workers of the Mechanical General Plant, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have launched a great campaign of technological innovation and technological revolution, relying on their own strength, and striving for self-improvement. Originally, they could only produce spare parts, but now they can produce complete sets of mechanical equipment. In the chemical industry, the coke production of the coking plant, the fertilizer output, and the coking chemical products have all increased compared to before. In the construction industry, specialized engineering companies and construction departments have been established to undertake the maintenance tasks of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, and to support other brother units. The revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "establishing a militia regiment," have set up militia organizations. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making contributions to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The part-time education of Wuhan Steel workers has also developed significantly. To actively promote agriculture, the company has also established a specialized agricultural office.

Chairman Mao recently taught: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel have shown the most courage and firmness, fully playing the leading role of the working class and the main force of the cultural revolution. They have high-held Chairman Mao's revolutionary banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and have thoroughly criticized the capitalist reactionary line and the "expert management," "technology first," "material incentives," and other revisionist lines of operation pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Through repeated struggles, they have thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei and Wuhan, such as Wang Renshou, to restore capitalism, and have achieved victory in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the great storm of the "January Revolution."

"When the people are happy, the reactionaries are in trouble." In the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies who are unwilling to perish have disguised themselves, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat, and spread the reactionary trend of "me first," creating divisions among revolutionary mass organizations, inciting armed struggles, and alienating military-civilian relations. This has caused the revolutionary organizations of Wuhan Steel, which had achieved revolutionary great unity, to split into two opposing factions, engaging in prolonged internal warfare, seriously affecting the revolution and production of Wuhan Steel. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with the close concern of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the great help of the People's Liberation Army's left-supporting troops, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel have stood up, set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, severely criticized and exposed the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," thoroughly exposed the harm of the "multi-center theory," and dug out the root causes of the "multi-center theory." In this struggle, the broad revolutionary workers have received profound education and tempering, greatly raising their class struggle and line struggle consciousness. They have more closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unified their thinking, unified their steps, and unified their actions, forming a vast revolutionary army to launch a fierce attack on the handful of class enemies, exposing the black hands that have infiltrated Wuhan Steel, and thoroughly smashing the sabotage plots of the handful of class enemies, further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity.

At present, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are prevalent throughout the steel city. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the people, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent. A great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, a great wave of supporting the army and loving the people, and a great wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production are emerging in Wuhan Steel. The broad steel workers, enduring the high temperatures, are fighting day and night on the blast furnaces, regarding producing more and better iron as a concrete action of their unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They are determined to fight in September and present excellent production results to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

At the celebration meeting, the broad steel workers reviewed the great achievements of Wuhan Steel over the past ten years and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They are determined to more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, turning Wuhan Steel into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Attending the celebration meeting were the commander of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the chairman of the Hubei Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Siyu, the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region, Zhang Yuhua and Li Huamin, the deputy chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee, Zhang Tixue, the commander of the Hubei Military Region, Zhao Fuxing, the deputy chairmen of the provincial revolutionary committee, Zhu Hongxia and Yang Daoyuan, and the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Garrison and the municipal revolutionary committee, Fang Ming, Zhang Chunqing, and Zhang Xu, etc. Zhang Yuhua and Zhang Tixue, on behalf of the people of the entire province and all the cadres and soldiers, extended warm congratulations to everyone. They said: In the excellent situation where the whole country is red, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Wuhan Steel is a double joy and of great significance. The important task facing us now is to seize the opportunity to do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. To do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must insist on the working class leading everything, "fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work." Resolutely oppose the "multi-center is no center" theory, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify thinking, unify steps, and unify actions, quickly implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and every order of the proletarian headquarters. At the same time, the working class should further arm themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought, raise their political consciousness, so that the working class can better play a leading role in the great struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and in implementing every item of work in Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

    新华社武汉十七日电　在全国山河一片红的大好形势下，武汉钢铁公司五万革命工人满怀胜利的喜悦隆重集会，热烈庆祝伟大领袖毛主席视察武钢十周年。
    武钢，是我国重要的钢铁工业基地之一，担负着支援祖国社会主义建设和国防建设的重要任务。我们伟大领袖毛主席从武钢兴建到投入生产，都给予了极其亲切的关怀和教导。
    一九五八年九月十三日，是武钢历史上最光荣、最幸福、最难忘的一天。这一天，我们伟大领袖毛主席，亲临武钢视察并作了极其重要的指示。毛主席说：“象武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业，除生产多种钢铁产品外，还要办点机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业等。”
    十年来，武钢的广大产业工人，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向，冲破一道道难关，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的大道上阔步前进，取得了一个又一个胜利。一九五八年以来，在生产钢铁产品的同时，武钢的机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业都有了很大发展。机械总厂的革命工人遵照毛主席的教导，大闹技术革新与技术革命，自力更生，奋发图强，原来只能制造备品备件，现在已能制造成套的机械设备。在化学工业方面，焦化厂的焦炭生产，化肥产量和炼焦化工产品都比以前有所增加。在建筑工业方面，专门建立了工程公司和修建部，担负着高炉和平炉的检修任务，并抽出力量支援其他兄弟单位。武钢革命职工遵照毛主席“大办民兵师”的伟大教导，办起了民兵组织，他们活学活用毛主席著作，为巩固无产阶级专政，做出了贡献。武钢职工业余教育也有了较大发展。为积极兴办农业，公司还专门成立了农业办公室。
    毛主席最近教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，武钢的广大革命工人表现得最英勇，最坚定，充分发挥了领导阶级和文化大革命主力军的作用。他们高举毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大造了党内一小撮走资派的反，深入揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的资产阶级反动路线，以及“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“物质刺激”等一整套修正主义办企业路线。经过反复的斗争，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北、武汉的代理人王任重之流妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，取得了向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，一小撮不甘心灭亡的阶级敌人乔装打扮，钻进无产阶级革命派内部，大肆鼓吹“以我为中心”的反动思潮，在革命群众组织之间制造分裂，挑动武斗，离间军民关系，使武钢已实现革命大联合的革命组织，分裂成对立的两大派，长期内战不休，使武钢革命和生产一度受到严重影响。在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在人民解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，武钢革命工人纷纷起来，摆开革命大批判的战场，狠批猛批反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，大摆“多中心论”的危害，大挖“多中心论”的根源，广大革命工人在这场斗争中，受到了深刻的教育和锻炼，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，揪出了伸进武钢的黑手，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    目前，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍及整个钢城，战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前深入人心，革命和生产形势一片大好。一个声势浩大的斗、批、改高潮、拥军爱民高潮以及抓革命、促生产的高潮，正在武钢开始出现。广大钢铁工人冒着高温，日夜奋战在高炉上，把多炼铁，炼好铁，当作无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的具体行动，他们决心奋战九月，以优异的生产成绩，向国庆十九周年献礼。
    在庆祝大会上，广大钢铁工人回顾武钢十年来的巨大成就，一遍又一遍地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们决心更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把武钢办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    出席庆祝大会的，有中国人民解放军武汉部队司令员、湖北省革委会主任曾思玉，武汉部队负责人张玉华、李化民，省革委会副主任张体学，湖北省军区司令员赵复兴，省革委会副主任朱洪霞、杨道远，以及武汉警备区、市革委会负责人方铭、张纯青、张绪等。张玉华和张体学代表全省人民和全体指战员向大家热烈庆贺。他们说：在全国山河一片红的大好形势下，庆祝伟大领袖毛主席视察武钢十周年，是喜上加喜，意义非常重大。现在摆在我们面前的重大任务，就是不失时机地搞好斗、批、改。搞好斗、批、改，必须坚持工人阶级领导一切，“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”坚决反对“多中心即无中心论”，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，迅速贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示和无产阶级司令部的每一个号令，同时工人群众要进一步用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑，提高自己的政治觉悟，使工人阶级在斗、批、改的伟大斗争中，在贯彻毛主席伟大战略部署的每项工作中更好地发挥领导作用。
