	Capital Revolutionary Masses Hold Rally to Celebrate the 23rd Anniversary of the Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

	The rally strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' frenzied aggression against Vietnam, their heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people, and the Soviet revisionists' military occupation of Czechoslovakia. It expressed determination to smash the U.S. imperialists' and Soviet revisionists' conspiracy to divide the world. Vice Premier Chen Yi and representatives of the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team attended the rally. Deputy Director Wu De and Ambassador Wu Mingluan spoke.

	BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) — Revolutionary masses from various sectors in the capital held a rally today to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The rally strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' frenzied aggression against Vietnam, their heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people, and the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's military occupation of Czechoslovakia. It expressed determination to smash the U.S. imperialists' and Soviet revisionists' conspiracy to divide the world. The revolutionary masses repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end!" "Firmly support the heroic struggle of the Czechoslovakian people against the Soviet occupation!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!"

	Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wang Xinting, Deputy Foreign Minister Luo Guibo, Deputy Director of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Wu De, and representatives of the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team attended the rally.

	Ambassador Wu Mingluan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China Nguyen Van Quang, and other Vietnamese friends in Beijing were invited to attend the celebration.

	The stage was adorned with portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The national flags of the two countries were displayed on either side of the portraits. Before the rally began, the revolutionary masses read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

	The rally was presided over by Ding Xilin, a member of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association.

	Wu De, Vice Director of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, spoke first. He extended the warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people fighting on the front lines of the anti-U.S. struggle. He said that for 23 years, the heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Workers' Party, have been fighting a long and heroic war of resistance against aggression to achieve the liberation of the entire nation and the unification of the motherland.

	He said that the ferocious U.S. imperialists are mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War, with no way out and in an extremely difficult situation. The victories achieved by the Vietnamese people are the fruits of their insistence on armed struggle and the triumph of people's war.

	He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, in order to salvage their defeat in Vietnam, are adopting more treacherous political deception and military blackmail. Under the guise of "partial bombing halt" and "peace talks," the U.S. imperialists are even more frenzied and barbaric in their prosecution of the Vietnam War.

	Wu De said that the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, pointed out: "For independence and freedom, our 31 million compatriots are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, and fight to the end." We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, will persist in a protracted war and will surely achieve final victory, driving the U.S. aggressors out of their own country and realizing the unification of Vietnam.

	Wu De went on to say that in the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has consistently played the role of the number one accomplice. It is proven that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is a very dangerous enemy of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation cause.

	He said that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, which has already surrendered to U.S. imperialism and betrayed the socialist cause, is just like the U.S. imperialists in invading Vietnam under the pretext of "defending freedom." It also invaded Czechoslovakia under the banner of "defending socialist achievements," openly and brazenly waging armed aggression and arbitrarily carving up a small country. This fully exposes the fact that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has degenerated into social imperialism and social fascism. He pointed out that the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership clique adopted a surrenderist policy of "non-resistance."

	He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's brazen military occupation of Czechoslovakia is the result of the sharpening contradictions between the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their struggle for hegemony and division of spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. It is the result of the U.S. and Soviet collusion in their attempt to redivide the world.

	He said that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique kidnapped the members of the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership clique to Moscow and forced them to sign a humiliating "capitulation agreement," confirming the Soviet revisionists' military occupation of Czechoslovakia. This is the product of U.S. pressure on the Soviet revisionists and the tightening of U.S.-Soviet global counter-revolutionary collusion. It is a shameful deal forced by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique with bayonets, a very crude deception attempted by the Soviet and Czechoslovakian revisionist renegade cliques to fool the Czechoslovakian people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world. This is actually a repeat of the Munich Agreement. The Czechoslovakian revisionist renegade clique's great betrayal this time fully shows that the revisionist renegade clique is not only a traitor to the proletariat but also a traitor to the nation when facing imperialist aggression.

	He said that we firmly believe that as long as the revolutionary Czechoslovakian people persist in their struggle, they will surely defeat the Soviet revisionists' aggression, defeat U.S. interference, overthrow the rule of the revisionist clique in their own country, and bring their country back to the path of proletarian dictatorship and socialism.

	Wu De said that the situation of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better and better. Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our socialist motherland has become even stronger. We will make greater contributions to the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world for liberation.

	In concluding his speech, Wu De said that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." The Chinese people will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war as our internationalist duty, and firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end, thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors, and achieving final victory.

	Ambassador Wu Mingluan, in his speech, condemned the U.S. imperialists for waging the most brutal war of aggression in human history in Vietnam, attempting to crush the Vietnamese people's will to fight for independence and freedom, and attempting to turn South Vietnam into a new type of colony and their stronghold of aggression in Southeast Asia.

	He detailed the continuous and fierce blows dealt by the military and people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front headed by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, to the U.S. aggressors, and the glorious victories achieved. He said that from the Tet Offensive in early 1968 to the summer, the military and people of South Vietnam had killed, wounded, and captured about 380,000 U.S. and puppet troops, including more than 130,000 U.S. troops.

	He condemned the U.S. imperialists for waging a war of destruction in the North, attempting to force the Vietnamese nation to surrender with bombs. He emphasized that the bombs of U.S. imperialism cannot shake the resolve of our northern compatriots to support their southern kin. He said that so far, the North has shot down more than 3,100 U.S. planes, and more than a thousand U.S. air pirates have either been killed or captured alive.

	Wu Mingluan denounced the U.S. imperialists for intensifying the war in both the North and the South while at the same time playing the "peace talks" trick. He said that the words and deeds of the U.S. imperialists exposed their two-faced nature, proving that the U.S. has not abandoned its ambition to invade Vietnam.

	Ambassador Wu Mingluan stressed that our consistent position is: the U.S. government must stop its aggression against the Vietnamese people, must withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppets from South Vietnam; must unconditionally and permanently stop all bombing and other acts of war against the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	He said that now, we Vietnamese people are resolutely implementing Chairman Ho's call: "Our entire people, North and South, are united, resolutely fighting, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

	In speaking of the friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, Wu Mingluan said, Chairman Mao said: "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." Chairman Mao's words, full of lofty internationalism and fraternal feelings, have been turned into actual actions by the Chinese people. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese Workers' Party, we express our deep gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the 700 million brotherly Chinese people for their great, precious, and effective assistance.

	He said that over the past two years, the Chinese people have been vigorously and extensively carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, almost all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China have established revolutionary committees based on revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now in the stage of striving for comprehensive victory. The Chinese people are implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, further playing the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work.

	In concluding his speech, Wu Mingluan said that the Vietnamese people regard the achievements of the brotherly Chinese people as the greatest encouragement to their own revolutionary struggle. The Vietnamese people fully support all the efforts made by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The rally was jointly organized by the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, the Beijing Workers' Congress, the Beijing Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards' Congress of Higher Education Institutions, and the Red Guards' Congress of Middle Schools. Responsible members of the organizing units and representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing also attended the rally.

	At the end of the rally, the entire audience stood up and sang the "Internationale."

    首都各界革命群众举行集会
    庆祝越南民主共和国独立二十三周年
    大会强烈谴责美帝疯狂进行侵越战争，谴责苏修侵占
    捷克斯洛伐克，表示要坚决粉碎美帝苏修瓜分世界的阴谋
    陈毅副总理等和首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队代表出席　吴德副主任和吴明鸾大使讲话
    新华社三十一日讯首都各界革命群众今天下午举行集会，庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年。
    大会强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂进行侵越战争，对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行，谴责苏修叛徒集团军事侵占捷克斯洛伐克，表示要坚决粉碎美帝、苏修勾结瓜分世界的阴谋。革命群众一再振臂高呼：“坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！”“坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反抗苏军占领的英勇斗争！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”
    国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，中国人民解放军副总参谋长王新亭，外交部副部长罗贵波，北京市革命委员会副主任吴德，首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，出席了大会。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，和在北京的其他越南朋友应邀出席了庆祝大会。
    大会主席台上高挂着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的画像，画像的两侧挂着中越两国的国旗。大会开始前，革命群众齐声朗读毛主席语录和胡志明主席语录。
    大会由中越友协理事丁西林主持。
    北京市革命委员会副主任吴德首先讲话。他向战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，二十三年来，英雄的越南人民，在伟大领袖胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，为了实现全民族的解放和祖国的统一，进行了长期的、英勇的反侵略战争。
    他说，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义深陷在侵越战争的泥潭中，走投无路，处境空前困难。越南人民所取得的胜利，是坚持武装斗争的成果，是人民战争的胜利。
    他指出，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的败局，采取更加阴险的政治欺骗和军事讹诈的反革命两手。美帝国主义在它的“部分停炸”和“和平谈判”的掩盖下，更加疯狂、更加野蛮地推行侵越战争。
    吴德说，越南人民伟大领袖胡志明主席指出：“为了独立和自由，我国三千一百万同胞决心克服一切困难，不惜牺牲，决战决胜。”我们坚信，越南人民响应胡志明主席的号召，坚持持久战争，就一定能够夺取最后胜利，从自己国土上赶走美国侵略者，实现越南的统一。
    吴德接着说，在美帝国主义侵略越南的战争中，苏修领导集团一贯扮演着头号帮凶的角色。事实证明，苏修领导集团是越南人民抗美救国事业的一个极其危险的敌人。
    他说，早已投降了美帝国主义、葬送了社会主义成果的苏修叛徒集团，同美帝国主义在“保卫自由”的借口下侵略越南一样，也在“保卫社会主义成果”的旗号下，公然对捷克斯洛伐克进行赤裸裸的武装侵略，任意宰割一个小国。这充分暴露了苏修叛徒集团已经堕落成为社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义。他指出捷修领导集团对此采取了投降主义的“不抵抗”政策。
    他指出，苏修叛徒集团这次悍然武装占领捷克斯洛伐克，是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义在东欧争夺和划分势力范围的矛盾尖锐化的结果，是美、苏勾结妄图重新瓜分世界引起的结果。
    他说，苏修把捷修领导集团的成员劫持到莫斯科，迫使他们签订了屈辱的“城下之盟”，肯定了苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的军事占领。这是美帝向苏修施加压力、美苏加紧全球反革命勾结的产物，是苏修叛徒集团用刺刀逼迫捷修叛徒集团进行的一笔可耻交易，是苏修和捷修叛徒集团企图愚弄捷克斯洛伐克人民、苏联人民和全世界人民的一个十分拙劣的骗局。这实际上是慕尼黑协定的再版。捷修叛徒集团这一次的大叛卖行径，充分说明，修正主义叛徒集团不但是无产阶级的叛徒，而且在遭受帝国主义侵略时必然是民族的叛徒。
    他说，我们坚信，革命的捷克斯洛伐克人民只要坚持斗争，就一定能打败苏修的侵略，打败美帝的干涉，推翻本国修正主义集团的统治，使自己的祖国重新回到无产阶级专政和社会主义的道路上来。
    吴德说，我国无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，而且越来越好。经过这场无产阶级文化大革命，我们的社会主义祖国变得更加强大了。我们将对世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争做出更大的贡献。
    吴德在结束他的讲话时说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”中国人民坚决遵循毛主席的这一教导，把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争当作自己应尽的国际主义义务，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利。
    吴明鸾大使在讲话中谴责美帝国主义在越南进行了一场人类历史上最残暴的侵略战争，企图压垮越南人民争取独立和自由的意志，企图把越南南方变成新型殖民地和它在东南亚的侵略据点。
    他详细谈到越南南方军民在以阮友寿主席为首的解放阵线的领导下，连续不断地给予美国强盗的雷霆般的打击，和取得的辉煌胜利。他说，从一九六八年新春大捷到夏末，南方军民打死、打伤和俘虏了大约三十八万美伪军和仆从军，其中包括十三万多美军。
    他谴责美帝国主义对北方发动了破坏性战争，妄图用炸弹来迫使越南民族投降。他强调说，美帝国主义的炸弹绝不能动摇我们北方同胞支援骨肉南方同胞的决心。他说，到目前为止，越南北方已经击落了三千一百多架美国飞机，已有上千名美国飞贼，或被击毙，或被生俘。
    吴明鸾斥责美帝国主义一方面在南北两个地区强化战争，另一方面，又大搞“和谈”骗局。他说，美帝国主义的言词和行动暴露了它口蜜腹剑的本性，证明美国并没有放弃侵略越南的野心。
    吴明鸾大使强调指出，我们一贯的立场是：美国政府必须停止它对越南人民的侵略战争，必须把美军及其仆从军撤出越南南方；必须永远无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸及其他战争行动。
    他说，现在，我们越南人民正在坚决实现胡主席的号召：“我们全国人民南北一心，坚决抗战，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。”
  吴明鸾大使在谈到越中两国人民的友谊时说，毛主席说：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”毛主席这一番充满崇高国际主义精神和兄弟情谊的话，已经在中国人民群众中变成了实际行动。我们代表越南人民，越南政府和越南劳动党对毛主席、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和七亿兄弟的中国人民给予的巨大、宝贵和有效的援助表示深切的感谢。
    他说，两年来，中国人民高举毛泽东思想旗帜，轰轰烈烈和广泛、深入地进行无产阶级文化大革命。目前，中国几乎所有的省、市和自治区已在革命大联合和革命三结合的基础上成立了革命委员会。无产阶级文化大革命正处在争取全面胜利阶段。中国人民正在贯彻毛主席的指示，进一步发挥工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。
    吴明鸾在结束讲话时说，越南人民把兄弟的中国人民的成就看作是对自己革命斗争的最大的鼓舞，越南人民全力支持中国人民在社会主义革命、社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中所作出的一切努力。
    大会由中国越南友好协会、北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会联合举办。主办单位的负责成员，以及中国人民解放军驻京部队五好战士代表，也出席了大会。
    大会结束时，全场起立，齐唱《国际歌》。
