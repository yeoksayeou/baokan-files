The members of the Qinghai Plastic Factory Revolutionary Committee have transformed their work style, appearing among the masses as ordinary laborers. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with everyone, doing thorough and detailed ideological and political work, and have effectively promoted the development of the revolution and production.

The great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "The most fundamental point in reforming state organs is to link up with the masses," is the fundamental guiding principle for building revolutionary committees. How can revolutionary committees at various levels grasp this "most fundamental point," temper themselves in the crucible of the masses' struggle, cultivate the style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and strengthen the building of the revolutionary regime? The members of the Qinghai Plastic Factory Revolutionary Committee have gained some beneficial experience in this regard.

The members of the Qinghai Plastic Factory Revolutionary Committee have gone deep among the masses and maintained close ties with them by honestly participating in production labor and respectfully learning from the masses. They regard participating in labor as an important way to link up with the masses and learn from them. Among the seven members of the factory revolutionary committee, three worker representatives elected by the workers have consistently stayed at their production posts. The other members also take turns participating in two days of shift labor each week, appearing among the masses as ordinary laborers, with no special treatment. They say: "Learning from the masses is the first step to maintaining close ties with them. If one does not appear as an ordinary laborer, without the determination to be a student of the masses, even if one spends the whole day among the masses, one cannot effectively link up with them." They have learned a lesson in this regard.

After the factory revolutionary committee was established, a few representatives of revolutionary cadres went to the workshops. At that time, they were full of enthusiasm, talking here and pointing out there; today they would have a heart-to-heart talk with this person, and tomorrow they would help educate that person. This approach was sharply criticized by the old workers: "As soon as you became a committee member, you started showing off your authority!" Some committee members could not understand this criticism at first, feeling that they had gone deep among the masses, gone to the front line, and worked hard all day, so why were they still criticized? After learning about this situation, the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory immediately organized all the committee members to study Chairman Mao's instruction, "We should go among the people and learn from them." Through study and discussion, everyone agreed: In the previous stage, the attitude towards linking up with the masses was not correct. To maintain close ties with the masses and be close to their hearts, one must get rid of the official airs of a "commander" and "educator," regard oneself as a student of the masses, participate in production labor, and humbly learn from the masses. From then on, the committee members began to consciously throw themselves into the crucible of production labor, consciously place themselves under the supervision of the revolutionary masses, consciously examine their words and deeds among the masses, and consciously humbly learn from the masses.

The factory revolutionary committee formulated a system for committee members to participate in labor, with each member fixed in one workshop for long-term participation, "unmoved by thunder." After becoming a member of the revolutionary committee, the old worker Wei Peirong strictly required himself, humbly learned from the masses, and never left labor. When the revolutionary committee held meetings, he often carried his tools, and as soon as the meeting ended, he went to work. The Jin Dian Xiao Zu in which Old Wei is located is responsible for the maintenance of machinery and equipment throughout the factory. He does not mind getting dirty, tired, or bothered, always responds immediately when called, and proactively maintains the machinery to ensure normal production. The workers unanimously praised: "Old Wei, except for the two words 'committee member,' is no different from us. Whatever oil stains we have on our hands, Old Wei has the same. The position has changed, but the essence of an ordinary laborer has not changed, truly a good example!" Old Wei also deeply felt: "The more calluses on your hands, the fewer 'selfish' thoughts in your mind; the more calluses on your hands, the more affection you have for the masses; the more calluses on your hands, the stronger the Great Wall against revisionism in your mind, and the more firmly you hold power." Revolutionary cadres Wu Yongbao and Chai Jiangyang, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, had fought side by side with the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction and had deep class feelings with the revolutionary masses. After becoming the chairman and vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee, they insisted on two days of shift labor each week. Whatever task the small group assigned, they did it. Through labor, they learned the good thoughts and good style of the masses and also gained stronger support from the masses, overcoming the shortcomings of being afraid and not having a strong backbone, and becoming even closer to the masses.

The important experience of the members of the Qinghai Plastic Factory Revolutionary Committee in linking up with the masses is: They must continuously arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, and do thorough and detailed ideological and political work.

In this regard, they went through the following process: Before March this year, the rubber wood production group's production tasks were not completed well. The person in charge of the revolutionary committee came to this group to help solve the problem. Initially, they were eager to find solutions from production management and were once entangled in administrative matters, busy all day, but production could not be improved. Later, they emphasized proletarian politics, organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focused on ideological work. The masses' ideological appearance quickly underwent profound changes, daily output increased steadily, and they excellently completed the production tasks, creating the highest daily output record for this group and leaping to become an advanced group. The masses said: "This time, the key point has been grasped, the root has been grasped." The revolutionary committee carefully studied the experience of the rubber wood group, conducted a comprehensive review of the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizing proletarian politics throughout the factory. Everyone agreed that after the committee members went deep among the masses, although there were thousands of tasks, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought was the most fundamental one.

From then on, this factory revolutionary committee has consistently and unwaveringly followed the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and firmly grasped the fundamentals without deviation. They went deep among the masses, led the masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and did the following together with the masses: study and recite the "Three Constantly Read Articles"; insist on reading every day; fight against selfishness and repudiate revisionism; hold reporting meetings.

    坚持参加劳动是密切联系群众的最好途径
    青海塑料厂革委会委员们转变工作作风，以一个普通劳动者的身份出现在群众中，和大家一起活学活用毛主席著作，做深入细致的思想政治工作，有力地推动了革命和生产的发展
    本报讯　“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一英明教导，是建设革命委员会的根本指导方针。各级革委会怎样才能抓好这“最根本的一条”，在群众斗争的熔炉中锤炼自己，培养紧密联系群众的作风，加强革命政权的建设？青海塑料厂革命委员会的委员们，在这方面取得了一些有益的经验。
    青海塑料厂革委会委员深入群众，联系群众，是从老老实实参加生产劳动，恭恭敬敬向群众学习做起的。他们把参加劳动作为联系群众、向群众学习的重要途径。厂革委会七个委员中，工人中选出的三名革命群众代表，一直坚持生产岗位。其余委员也每周轮流参加两天顶班生产劳动，以普通劳动者的身份出现在群众之中，毫不特殊化。他们说：“向群众学习，是密切联系群众的第一步。如果不以普通劳动者身份出现，没有甘当群众小学生的决心，虽然成天混在群众之中，也不能很好地联系群众。”在这方面，他们是有教训的。
    厂革命委员会诞生以后，委员中几个革命领导干部的代表就分头到车间去。当时，他们怀着满腔热情，在这里说一说，到那里指点指点；今天找这个谈心，明天又帮助教育那个。他们这种做法受到老工人的尖锐批评：“刚当上委员，派头就耍开了！”个别委员对这种批评一时想不通，觉得自己深入了群众，走到了第一线，成天辛辛苦苦地工作，怎么还挨“批”？厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，了解到这种情况以后，立即组织全体委员学习毛主席“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习”的教导。通过学习、讨论，大家一致认为：前一阶段，联系群众的态度还不端正。要密切联系群众，跟群众心贴心，必须打掉“指挥者”、“教育者”的官架子，把自己看做群众的小学生，参加生产劳动，虚心向群众学习。从此，革委会委员们便开始自觉地投身到生产劳动的熔炉中，自觉地把自己置于革命群众的监督之下，自觉地在群众中检查自己的言行，自觉地虚心向群众学习。
    厂革委会制定了委员参加劳动的制度，每个委员都固定在一个车间里劳动，长期坚持，“雷打不动”。老工人魏沛荣当上革委会委员以后，更加严格地要求自己，虚心向群众学习，从未脱离过劳动。革委会开会的时候，他也常常身带工具，会议结束，就去劳动。老魏所在的金电小组，担负着全厂的机具维修任务。他不嫌脏，不嫌累，不嫌麻烦，总是随叫随到，并且做到主动维修机具，保证正常生产。工人们同声赞扬：“老魏除了‘委员’两字和我们不一样，别的都跟我们一样。我们手上有多少油污，老魏也有多少油污。职务变了，普通劳动者的本色不变，真是好样的！”老魏也深有体会地说：“手上多打一个茧子，脑子里少一个‘私’字；手上多打几个茧子，就和群众多几分感情；手上茧子越多，脑子里防修反修的长城就筑得越厚，权就掌得越牢靠。”革命领导干部吴永葆、柴江扬，在无产阶级文化大革命中，曾经同八·一八无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，同革命群众有着深厚的阶级感情。他们分别当上革委会主任、副主任以后，每周坚持两天顶班劳动，小组分派干什么活，他们就干什么活。通过劳动，他们学到了群众的好思想、好作风，也得到了群众更加有力的支持，克服了“怕”字当头、腰杆不硬等缺点，同群众心贴得更紧了。
    青海塑料厂革委会成员，联系群众的重要经验是：必须不断地用毛泽东思想武装群众，发动群众，做深入细致的思想政治工作。
    这方面，他们经历了这样一段过程：今年三月份以前，胶木生产小组生产任务一直完成得不好。革委会负责人到这个小组来帮助解决问题。开初，他们急于从生产管理上想办法，曾经一度纠缠在事务圈子里，成天忙忙碌碌，生产还是抓不上去。后来，他们突出无产阶级政治，大力组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓思想工作，群众思想面貌迅速发生了深刻的变化，日产量节节上升，出色地完成了生产任务，创造了这个小组日产量最高纪录，一跃而为先进小组。群众说：“这下才抓到点子上，抓住了根本。”革委会认真研究了胶木小组的经验，全面检查了全厂活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的情况。大家一致认为，革委会委员深入群众以后，尽管工作有千条万条，用毛泽东思想武装群众是最根本的一条。
    从此，这个厂革委会一直坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，狠抓根本不转向。他们深入到群众之中，带动群众活学活用毛泽东思想，做到了同群众一起大学大背“老三篇”；坚持天天读；同群众一起斗私批修；同群众一起召开讲用会。
