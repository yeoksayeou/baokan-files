Everyone says that poor peasant community member Deng Fangfu Grandpa has changed a lot recently. Not long ago, he was poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line and even didn't want to be the deputy team leader of the production brigade; but recently, he has become an active element who studies and applies Chairman Mao's works actively, promotes revolution and production, and cares about the collective. He also happily sent his eldest son to the army, insisting that the PLA must accept him, saying that he wants to cultivate him into a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

What happened?

One evening, a fire broke out at Grandpa Deng's house. After learning about it, soldiers from a certain air force unit rushed over eight or nine li, and together with local community members, quickly extinguished the fire. On their way back, the soldiers started discussing. Some said: Today, we fought a fire for the people, which tempered our red hearts to serve the people. Others said: Today's firefighting battle has deepened the bond between the military and the people. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone felt very happy. However, the Five Good Soldier Ma Shaoji raised a question: Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Have we done our job by just putting out the fire?

For a long time after the lights were turned off, no one could sleep. The words "completely" and "thoroughly" spurred everyone on, and they all thought about what they should do after putting out the fire.

In the company office, the political instructor and the company commander were also discussing how to help Grandpa Deng. Suddenly, the new soldier Xiao Longlian, holding "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and other red books, as well as the clothes and surplus allowances he brought when he enlisted, pushed open the door of the company office. Little Xiao said: I really can't sleep. I thought, now I am sleeping here, but where will Grandpa Deng live after his house caught fire? What difficulties will he face in his life? Now he needs Mao Zedong Thought the most! We should send Mao Zedong Thought to Grandpa Deng's heart, this is the greatest "love for the people." Political Instructor Liu Deming was very moved after hearing Xiao's words: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers, with deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, are studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions with great enthusiasm. Their steps towards thought revolutionization are so fast! Before the political instructor could say anything, the door was pushed open again, and suddenly a lot of soldiers rushed in, some holding red books, others holding self-reliance and hard struggle slogans. Their thoughts were the same as Xiao's: use Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance to help Grandpa Deng rebuild his home.

The next day, the company's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team arrived at Grandpa Deng's house. They studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "hard struggle" and "self-reliance," and then started building walls and houses with the community members. The soldiers worked while talking with Grandpa Deng, spreading Mao Zedong Thought, recalling bitterness and sweetness together, and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev together.

Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Grandpa Deng's heart. With the help of the PLA soldiers, he understood the importance of power: if the working people lose power, they will lose everything. To ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers do not change color, the power must be firmly grasped by the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. In the new house built by the PLA soldiers and the community members, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging neatly on the wall, he said excitedly: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I will definitely listen to your words, whatever you say, I will do!"

"South Nanjing Road's Good Eighth Company" soldiers often go to the production brigades in their stationed areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the grassroots cadres and community members. This is the Good Eighth Company soldiers introducing their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants in the fields.

    爱民新曲
    大家都说贫农社员邓方富老大爷最近大变了。前些日子，他因为受了资产阶级反动路线的毒害，连生产队副队长都不想干了；可是，最近却变成一个活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命、促生产，关心集体的积极分子。他还高高兴兴地把他的大儿子送到部队，硬要叫解放军收下，说要把他培养成毛主席的好战士。
    这是怎么一回事呢？
    一天傍晚，邓大爷家失火了，空军某部战士们得信后，一口气跑了八、九里地，和当地社员一起，很快把火扑灭了。在回来的路上，战士们议论开了，有的说：今天为群众救这场火，又锤炼了我们为人民服务的红心。有的说：今天的灭火战斗使军民友情结得更深了。遵照毛主席的教导办了事，大家都觉得很高兴。五好战士马绍基却提出了一个问题：毛主席教导我们要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，我们把火扑灭了就算完事了吗？
    熄灯哨吹过很久，同志们躺在床上谁也没睡着，“完全”、“彻底”四个大字鞭策着大家，都在想着灭火之后应该做什么？
    连部里，指导员和连长也在研究如何帮助邓大爷。突然，新战士萧龙联拿着《愚公移山》等红色宝书和自己入伍时带来的衣服和节余的津贴，把连部的门推开了。小萧说：我实在睡不着。我想，现在我睡在这里，可邓大爷家失火后，他住在哪里？生活上的困难会引起他什么想法？现在他是多么需要毛泽东思想啊！我们应该把毛泽东思想送到邓大爷的心坎上，这才是最大的“爱民”。指导员刘德宏听完小萧的话非常激动：在无产阶级文化大革命中，战士们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作和一系列最新指示，他们思想革命化的步子迈得多么快啊！指导员还来不及说什么，门又推开了，一下子又挤进来好多战士，有的拿着红色宝书，有的拿着自力更生，艰苦奋斗的语录……。他们的想法和小萧完全一样：用毛主席关于自力更生的教导帮助邓大爷重建家园。
    第二天，连队的毛泽东思想宣传队来到了邓大爷家里。他们共同学习了伟大领袖毛主席“艰苦奋斗”、“自力更生”等教导，接着就和社员一起，动手打墙，盖房子。战士们一边劳动，一边和邓大爷谈心，宣传毛泽东思想，和他一起忆苦思甜，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。
    毛泽东思想照亮了邓大爷的心。在解放军战士的帮助下，他懂得了政权的重要：劳动人民失掉了政权就会失掉一切，要保证社会主义江山不变颜色，就得把印把子牢牢地掌握在工人阶级和贫下中农手里。在解放军战士和社员群众帮助他盖起的新房子里，他面对着墙上端端正正地挂着的毛主席像，激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我一定好好听您老人家的话，您咋说，我就咋办！”
