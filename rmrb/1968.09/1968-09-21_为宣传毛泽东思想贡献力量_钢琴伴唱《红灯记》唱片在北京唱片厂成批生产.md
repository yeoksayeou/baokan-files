Piano-accompanied recordings of "The Red Lantern" are being mass-produced at the Beijing Record Factory.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, September 20th - Piano-accompanied recordings of "The Red Lantern" are currently being mass-produced at the newly established Beijing Record Factory.

	The Beijing Record Factory was established during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, transforming from the original Beijing Playing Card Factory. The revolutionary workers of this factory, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, decided to change their production direction. After conducting investigations and surveys, they discovered that since the Cultural Revolution, the demand for revolutionary records among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers had increased tens of times, while the production capacity of record factories was far from meeting the demand. Therefore, they decided to shift production to records that promote Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, some people lacked confidence, believing that three-quarters of the factory's workers were formerly housewives with low technical skills, making it difficult to produce records. The workers studied the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take their destiny into their own hands and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not avoid problems but will solve them with a positive attitude. Any difficulty in the world can be overcome." The workers decided to forge ahead despite the difficulties.

	During the transformation and trial production process, the Shanghai China Record Factory provided them with enthusiastic support. The workers of the China Record Factory, under the condition of having no blueprints, demonstrated the spirit of self-reliance and created a high-quality thin-film pressing machine for them. They also sent four experienced old workers to help them develop a suitable transformation plan. The Beijing Record Factory also actively sent workers to Shanghai to learn, solving the problem of insufficient technical strength. As a result, they completed the pressing of the first revolutionary record three months ahead of schedule.

	Currently, the workers of this factory are producing while transforming, striving to complete the overall transformation task as soon as possible. They have expressed their determination to produce revolutionary records and contribute to the promotion of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

### 为宣传毛泽东思想贡献力量  钢琴伴唱《红灯记》唱片在北京唱片厂成批生产

    为宣传毛泽东思想贡献力量
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》唱片在北京唱片厂成批生产
    新华社二十日讯  钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的塑料薄膜密纹唱片，正在新诞生的北京唱片厂成批生产。
    北京唱片厂，是在无产阶级文化大革命中，由原北京扑克牌厂改建成的。这个厂的革命工人通过革命大批判，决定改变生产方向。他们经过调查访问，了解到文化大革命以来，广大工农兵群众对革命唱片的需要量数十倍地增加，而唱片工厂生产的数量则远远不能满足需要。于是，他们决定改为生产宣传毛泽东思想的唱片。当时，有些人信心不足，认为本厂职工中有三分之二是过去的家庭妇女，技术水平低，生产唱片有困难。工人们学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”工人们决心迎着困难前进。
    在改建和试制过程中，上海中国唱片厂给了他们热情的援助。中国唱片厂的工人在没有图纸的条件下，发扬“自力更生”的精神，为他们制成一台质量优良的薄膜压片机，还派出四个经验丰富的老工人，帮助他们因地制宜地搞成了改建规划。北京唱片厂也主动派出工人到上海学习，解决了技术力量不足的困难。结果，比原计划提前三个多月压制成了第一张革命唱片。
    目前，这个厂的工人正在边生产，边改建，力争早日完成全面改建任务。他们表示一定要努力生产革命唱片，为宣传伟大的毛泽东思想贡献力量。
