This is a touching story that recently took place at Fudan University: Three old workers from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with deep proletarian feelings, educated a Red Guard who had fallen behind in his thinking, helping him quickly catch up with the majestic strides of the working class.

It was the night of September 10th, around 9:30 PM, when comrades Yu Bu-gen, Wu De-gen, and Shen Ming-xing came to the dormitory of this Red Guard. Seeing him, Yu comrade immediately asked, "Are you the leader?" "No, I'm not..." The sudden question made the Red Guard a bit embarrassed. But Yu comrade spoke frankly, "Being a leader is for the revolution, right? Why be so modest?" "Well, yes, I am the leader." Thus, a deep conversation began.

"You have objections to the revolutionary actions taken by our worker propaganda team recently, right?"

"The overall direction of your actions is correct, but the specific methods are wrong."

"Where are they wrong?"

"You don't trust us students."

"What do you mean, 'don't trust students'? If we don't trust students, how can we talk about the overall direction being correct?"

"This..."

"In this action, we, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, clearly targeted the class enemy. Look, we exposed three active counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, this action also struck at old ideas, stirring up a hornet's nest. Some people hid weapons for armed struggle, took public property home, and even read old novels. We workers see this and feel pain in our hearts, so we struck back. How can you say we don't trust students!"

"You are the leader. Have you seen that in the past two days, some classmates have had opposing sentiments towards our worker propaganda team? This is the 'good' influence you've set!"

"I don't understand your specific methods."

Hearing this, Yu comrade seriously asked, "Don't understand? Don't understand? From what position are you speaking? You are a son of poor peasants, why do you resist the revolutionary actions of our worker propaganda team so much?!"

This Red Guard was stunned by Yu comrade's question.

At this moment, Wu comrade couldn't help but interject, "Yu comrade started as an apprentice at 15, suffering decades of oppression and exploitation from the capitalists, and never even entered elementary school. Today, it is Chairman Mao who sent him to the university. To do a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, he worries every day. Seeing you make mistakes, he is so anxious that he can't sleep at night. You should listen to the old workers' advice."

Shen comrade, who hadn't spoken yet, then said meaningfully, "We three are all over fifty. From a young age, we suffered oppression from landlords and capitalists, enduring so much hardship! Today, our bodies are not in good shape. But with Chairman Mao's order, we came to the university. As soon as we arrived, seeing how the capitalist-roaders and reactionary authorities have turned our socialist university into this state, we truly can't sit still or sleep peacefully! How can you still be so comfortable? If you continue like this, you'll become revisionists! Parents have the responsibility to educate their children, and we, the working class, have the responsibility to cultivate our next generation. This strike against old ideas is for your good, how can you say we don't trust you?"

The old workers' earnest education left a deep impression on this Red Guard. His face turned red, and he lowered his head, unable to speak for a long time.

At this moment, Yu comrade calmly and patiently said, "You can have objections to our worker propaganda team, you are the leader, you can directly raise them to our leadership! We just can't stand you spreading complaints among your classmates. If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked. This time, what kind of example did you set? You set a wrong example. Seeing you do this, we are very anxious, today we came to help you." "Comrades, I, I understand your intentions. I was wrong..."

At this moment, this Red Guard was extremely moved and said, "I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words."

"You go back and think about it, think it through and then do the work with your classmates. You have made contributions in the Cultural Revolution, but you can't rely on past merits... We are all rough and direct, speaking bluntly and rudely, if we go too far, please forgive us, if we are wrong, please criticize us."

"No, no, no, I should learn from the comrades, be your good student."

The conversation ended like this. It was already midnight. This Red Guard lay in bed, the old workers' words still echoing in his ears. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep, thinking a lot:

"I come from a poor peasant family, grew up under the red flag, entered the university, but was intoxicated by the bourgeois and revisionist ideas. This time, the worker propaganda team struck at old ideas and habits, and I, slightly offended, developed resistance, standing behind the workers, pointing fingers, complaining east and west, isn't this a sign that my thoughts and feelings have changed, becoming distant from the workers and peasants?"

"In the past, as soon as I entered the school, some teachers led me astray; while the workers entered the school, they struck at old ideas without mercy, criticizing errors so sharply and seriously. Who truly cares for me? It is the workers!"

The next day, this Red Guard used his personal experiences to talk with his classmates, doing ideological work.

The third day, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals were issued. At the school-wide meeting celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he, combining his personal experiences, criticized and repudiated revisionism, taking the lead in sharing his thoughts on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He said, "Accepting the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers is a arduous struggle. The worker propaganda team is the best teacher for our re-education. Their strict political requirements for us are the greatest care for us Red Guards. We are at a turning point in our forward march, we must deeply revolutionize ourselves, and catch up with the majestic strides of the working class."

This Red Guard's sincere acceptance of the old workers' education and his quick correction of his mistakes won everyone's praise. A member of the worker propaganda team's Eighth Company, Third Platoon, Third Squad, Yan Zhong-ying, presented two shining Mao badges to this Red Guard. The Red Guards on the scene spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Comrade Yan Zhong-ying said, "Your speech yesterday showed the excellent qualities of daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to pioneer of the Red Guards. We, the working class, love such Red Guards. I hope you continue to criticize and repudiate revisionism, take the lead, lead everyone to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry the educational revolution to the end!" This Red Guard accepted the Mao badges, tears of excitement welling up in his eyes. He said, "These two Mao badges are not just for me, they are for all of us Red Guards. We will not disappoint the expectations of the working class, and be good descendants of the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

One climax followed another. Just as everyone's emotions were extremely stirred, old worker Yu Bu-gen rushed in from another meeting. As soon as he entered, he tightly grasped the Red Guard's hand, took out a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his pocket. This "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was awarded to him at the factory's meeting of active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao's works. He held this precious book and said earnestly, "I give this 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' to you, let us together study Chairman Mao's works well, learn a bit, use a bit, learn deeply and thoroughly, and forever follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution!" The old worker's words were filled with deep class feelings. This Red Guard quickly took off the Mao badge from his chest and pinned it on the old worker's chest, saying excitedly, "To show the Red Guards' determination to learn from the working class, I give you the Mao badge given to me by Old Fang from the military training team. The working class is our best parents, we Red Guards are determined to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life." At this moment, everyone spontaneously sang the song, "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents' love is not as deep as Chairman Mao's love." This song resonated like a warm current, warming everyone's heart. "The river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as class friendship," the working class loves the Red Guards the most, the working class and the Red Guards are heart to heart!

    “工人宣传队是对我们再教育的最好老师”
    ——记进驻复旦大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队老工人同红卫兵战士的一场深刻的谈心活动
    这是最近发生在复旦大学的一个动人的故事：工人毛泽东思想宣传队的三个老工人，以深厚的无产阶级感情教育一个思想上掉了队的红卫兵战士，迅速跟上工人阶级雄伟的前进步伐。
    那是九月十日的夜晚，九点半钟左右，郁布根、吴德根、沈明兴三位老师傅来到了这个红卫兵战士的宿舍。郁师傅看到了他，劈头就问：“你是头头吧？”“不，不是……”突如其来的问题使这个红卫兵战士有点尴尬。郁师傅却心直口快地说：“当头头是为了干革命嘛，何必客气！”“嗯，是的，我是头头。”于是，一场深刻的谈心活动就开始了。
    “听说，你对我们工人宣传队最近采取的革命行动有意见，是吗？”
    “你们的行动大方向是正确的，具体做法有错误。”
    “错在哪里？”
    “你们不相信我们学生。”
    “啥？不相信学生，你这是什么意思？如果我们不相信学生，那还说得上什么大方向正确？”
    “这……”
    “这次我们同广大革命师生一起采取革命行动，矛头明确地指向阶级敌人。你看，不是揪出了三个现行反革命分子吗？同时，这次行动又冲击了旧思想，捅了一下马蜂窝。有些人把武斗武器藏起来，把公物拿回家去，还读旧小说，我们工人看在眼里，痛在心里，因而冲击了一下，难道不是应该的吗？怎么能说是不相信学生！”
    “你是头头，你看到没有，这两天班级里有的同学同我们工人宣传队有对立情绪，这是你起的‘好’影响！”
    “我对你们的具体做法是想不通的。”
    听到这里，郁师傅不禁严肃地问道：“想不通，想不通，你这是站在什么位子上说话？你是贫下中农子弟，为什么对我们工人宣传队的革命行动这么抵触？！”
    这个红卫兵战士被郁师傅这一问，楞住了。
    这时候，吴师傅忍不住插进来说：“郁师傅十五岁当学徒，吃了资本家几十年压迫剥削的苦，连小学的门也没有进过。今天，是毛主席派他到大学来。为了搞好学校的斗、批、改，他每天都在操心，看到你们犯错误，他急得晚上睡不着觉。你要好好听老工人的意见。”
    还没有说过话的沈师傅这时也意味深长地说：“我们三个人都五十多岁了，从小受地主、资本家压迫，吃了多少苦！今天我们身体也都不怎么好。但是毛主席一声号令，我们就到大学来了。一到这里，看到走资派和资产阶级反动权威把我们的社会主义大学搞成这个样子，我们真是坐不安，睡不稳啊！你们怎么还过得蛮舒服？这样下去，你们要变修啦！父母有责任教育自己的孩子，我们工人阶级更有责任培养自己的下一代。这次冲击一下旧思想，是为了你们好，怎么能说是不相信你们呢？”
    老师傅语重心长的教育，一字一句都深印在这个红卫兵战士的心头。他脸涨得通红，低下了头，半天说不出话来。
    这时，郁师傅又心平气和地耐心地说道：“你对我们工人宣传队有意见完全可以提，你是头头，可以直接向我们领导上提嘛！我们就是看不惯你到同学中乱发牢骚。上梁不正下梁就要歪。你这个头头，这次带了什么头啊？带了错误的头。我们看到你这样做，很焦急，今天是来帮助你的。”“师傅，我，我懂得你们的心意。我错了……”这时，这位红卫兵小将无比激动地说。
    “你知道错，改了就好了。毛主席教导我们说：‘错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。’‘犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。’”
    红卫兵小将抬起头望着墙上挂的毛主席像，喃喃地说：“我一定听毛主席的话，我一定听毛主席的话。”
      “你回去再想一想，想通了就去做同学的工作。你在文化大革命中是立了功的，但是不能吃老本……。我们都是大老粗，讲话直来直去，粗里粗气，讲过头了请你原谅，讲错了请你批评。”
    “不，不，不，我应该向老师傅学习，做你们的好学生。”
    一场谈心就这样结束了。已经是深夜十二点钟了。这位红卫兵战士躺在床上，老工人的话音还一直在耳畔萦绕。他翻来覆去睡不着觉，想得好多好多：
    “自己出身下中农，长在红旗下，进了大学，却被资封修一套熏醉了。这次工人宣传队冲击旧思想旧习惯，自己稍稍受到一点触犯，就产生抵触情绪，站在工人后头指手划脚，怨东怨西，这不正说明自己思想感情变了，变得与工农兵离远了吗？”
    “过去一进学校，有的教师把我引向歧路；而工人一进学校，对旧思想毫不容情地冲击，对错误批评得那么尖锐、严肃。是谁真正爱护自己？是工人！”
    第二天，这个红卫兵战士就用自己的切身体会，去和同学们谈心，做思想工作。
    第三天，毛主席关于知识分子再教育的最新指示发表了。在全校革命师生热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的大会上，他又结合自己的亲身感受，斗私批修，带头谈了学习毛主席最新指示的体会。他说：“接受工农兵的再教育，是一个艰苦的斗争过程。工人宣传队是对我们再教育的最好老师，他们在政治上对我们从严要求，正是对我们红卫兵的最大爱护。我们正处在前进道路的转折点上，一定要深刻地革自己的命，跟上工人阶级雄伟的前进步伐。”
    这位红卫兵战士虚心接受老工人的教育，迅速改正自己的错误的行动，得到了大家的赞扬。工人宣传队八连一排三班队员严忠英把两枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章捧在手里送给这位红卫兵，在场的红卫兵小将情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”严忠英同志说：“你昨天的发言表明了红卫兵小将敢说、敢做、敢闯的优秀品质。我们工人阶级就是热爱这样的红卫兵小将。希望你继续斗私批修，起带头作用，带领大家落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把教育革命进行到底！”这位红卫兵接过毛主席像章，激动得热泪盈眶，他表示：这两枚毛主席像章不仅是送给我的，是送给我们全体红卫兵的，我们决不辜负工人阶级期望，做工农兵的好后代。
    高潮一个接一个。正当大家心情万分激动的时候，老工人郁布根从别处开完会急急地跑来了，他一进来就紧紧握着这位红卫兵的手，从口袋里掏出一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，这本《毛主席语录》是厂里开活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会时奖给他的。他拿着这本宝书，语重心长地说：“我把这本《毛主席语录》送给你，让我们一起好好学习毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，学深学透，永远紧跟毛主席闹革命！”老工人的话一字字、一句句充满了深厚的阶级感情。这位红卫兵急忙摘下自己胸前的毛主席像章，别在老工人胸前，并激动地说：“为了表示红卫兵小将向工人阶级学习的决心，我把军训团老方同志送给我的毛主席像章转送给你。工人阶级是我们最好的父母，我们红卫兵决心要向工农兵学习一辈子，为工农兵服务一辈子。”这时，大家不约而同地唱起“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的歌子，这歌声象一股暖流温暖着每一个人的心房。“河深海深不如阶级友爱深”，工人阶级最爱护红卫兵，工人阶级和红卫兵心连心！　（原载上海《解放日报》，本报略有删改）
