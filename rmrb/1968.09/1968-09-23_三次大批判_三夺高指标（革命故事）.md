Before the story begins, let us all study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together: "Our country has seven hundred million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work..."

The story takes place in the Beijing Western Suburbs at the Mu Cheng Jian Coal Mine:

One morning, the sun rose in the east, golden rays shining everywhere. The Jingxi mine was ablaze with red. The whistle had not yet sounded for the start of the workday, but the office of the Revolutionary Committee of the Mu Cheng Jian Coal Mine was filled with the urgent ringing of the telephone. The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Old Li, picked up the receiver and had not even asked, "Who is this?" when he heard, "The workers of the Thousand Army Terrace Rock Excavation Team Six are discussing the excavation plan for July today. We are preparing to achieve 240 meters..." Old Li thought he had heard wrong and quickly interjected, "What? Achieving 240 meters in July?" "Yes, please have the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at the mine attend our meeting." Old Li did not say anything else and gently placed the receiver down. This comrade of worker origin understood the workers' sentiments and knew the situation at the mine. He had never heard such a number since the mine was established. It was in 1964 when a handful of capitalist roaders within the mine faithfully executed the revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen. On one hand, they implemented strict "control, restrict, deduct, and punish" measures, openly practicing dictatorship over the working class. On the other hand, these scoundrels, to achieve their nefarious goals, used money and material goods as bait, personally directing the battle: adjusting machinery, selecting workers, and organizing a so-called "first-class" excavation team of over two hundred people. However, they used all their tricks, working to the point of exhaustion for a month, but the result? They only managed to achieve 203 meters. Now...

He was still thinking about this when the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team member, Comrade Yan Haitao, rushed in. Before Old Li could speak, Yan Haitao hurriedly said, "Old Li, I'm going to Thousand Army Terrace right now. Do you have any instructions?" Old Li decisively said, "Tell everyone that the Revolutionary Committee supports them!" "Good!" Yan Haitao replied and set off. When he climbed up the steep slopes to reach Thousand Army Terrace, the meeting of the Rock Excavation Team had already begun. One hundred and one rock excavation workers, all dressed and ready, sat around the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, listening attentively to the speech by the veteran worker and shift leader, Dong Shaoshan: "Comrades! Vice Chairman Lin has said, 'The best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.' We are workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With this, one person is worth ten of theirs. Not to mention 240 meters, even 250 meters is no problem!"

Following this, there was a thunderous round of applause. "Learn from the workers! Salute the workers!" After leading a few slogans, Yan Haitao conveyed the opinions of the Revolutionary Committee and suggested that everyone discuss specific measures.

The working class has the reddest hearts and leads the revolutionary production. After a thorough discussion, they formulated a "three criticisms of the capitalist roaders, three times seizing high targets" battle plan.

First Criticism: A Victorious Start

On June 30, the flags of the Rock Excavation Team Six were flying high, and the drums were beating loudly. The rally was in progress. The revolutionary workers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the handful of capitalist roaders led by the Chinese Khrushchev, dragged the mine's capitalist roaders to the meeting venue. First, they criticized the counter-revolutionary fallacies of "technology first" and "material first" spread by the capitalist roaders. Then, they announced the plan to excavate 240 meters in July. The capitalist roaders listened, snorting cold air through their noses, mumbling, "Impossible! Impossible!" The workers, seeing the capitalist roaders' discontent, were all enraged and sternly exposed them on the spot: "In the past, you used a few foreign books to intimidate the workers, shouting 'no technology, no progress' every day. We don't believe in your tricks. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought, we rely on the revolutionary spirit of 'Moving Mountains with Persistence.' We will definitely achieve what we say and create miracles." "Yes, the working class must forge ahead on paths never taken before and create miracles never achieved before!" The workers' heartfelt vows were powerful and resonant, shaking the mountains.

Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we march forward. That night, just as the workers were rolling up their sleeves, ready to join the battle, the great news of Chairman Mao's reception of coal miners reached the mine. The miners' hearts pounded, and tears of excitement flowed down their faces. Everyone was filled with enthusiasm and high spirits, holding up the Little Red Book and singing battle songs, entering the battle under the sound of the whistle. Look! Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the mine shaft, and the revolutionary miners laugh with joy. The workers gave their all, leading the charge; the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team followed closely. The workface was filled with the clanging of drills, the roar of pneumatic hammers, and sparks flying everywhere; the small rails were filled with the clattering of mine cars coming and going, rushing back and forth. What a battle scene! The first record was broken, and the first shift achieved three cycles, excavating 10.9 meters, creating a high target never before seen in the mine's history. In just fourteen days, they completed the state's plan of 120 meters per month, expressing the working class's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Second Criticism: Another Victory

On July 15, the workers of the Rock Excavation Team Six studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "grabbing revolution and promoting production" repeatedly. They dragged the capitalist roaders to the mouth of the Thousand Army Terrace pit and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionists' "bonus first" fallacy face-to-face. Veteran worker Bi Ximing was the first to speak. He pointed at the capitalist roaders and angrily questioned, "You once told us, 'political leadership, no bonus leadership is faster.' You, to produce more coal and create high yields, actually brought new 'Panda' brand radios, 'Flying Pigeon' brand bicycles, large bed sheets, and large silver shields to the coal face to bribe workers. You also spread 'creating high yields, hosting banquets for you' and other fallacies to lure workers. It's truly evil to the extreme!" Bi Ximing's speech was like a dagger, like a cannonball, hitting the enemy's vital spot. The capitalist roaders, in front of the workers, were so frightened that their faces turned pale, their bodies trembled, and they kept saying, "I deserve to die! I deserve to die!" Old Bi, looking at the enemy's pathetic appearance, said proudly, "The working class is not something that can be deceived by a few stinking dollars. We mine coal to revolutionize, to build socialism, to make Chairman Mao proud..."

Bi Ximing's words expressed the wishes of all revolutionary miners. The workers of Team Six criticized the "bonus first" fallacy, established the idea of mining coal for the revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and marched forward, victorious. On July 27, the workers of Team Six, with unprecedented heroism, successfully completed the magnificent plan of 240 meters. The news spread, and the entire mine was in an uproar. The sound of drums, firecrackers, applause, and slogans merged into one. Here they come! The mine's Revolutionary Committee is coming to congratulate the team! Congratulating the workers of Thousand Army Terrace Team Six for creating astonishing miracles under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Third Criticism: Victorious Battle Song

After the workers of the Rock Excavation Team Six completed the planned target, they were not satisfied. According to the plan, they dragged the capitalist roaders to the site for the third time. The workers, pointing at the capitalist roaders, asked, "How is it? Your fallacies have been proven wrong on the spot. We, the red miners armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved the new record of 240 meters!" The capitalist roaders were surprised and muttered, "Truly admirable! Truly admirable!" Saying this, they lowered their heads like deflated balloons. Although the workers saw that the capitalist roaders were completely defeated, they did not end the battle. They deeply understood that the working class is the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. Therefore, everyone was filled with enthusiasm, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to create new achievements for the people. At this moment, veteran worker Bi Ximing stood up, saluted Chairman Mao's portrait, and then said to everyone, "The evil old society, the capitalists called the workers 'coal blackies.' It was the great leader Chairman Mao who gave us coal miners the glorious title of the working class; since liberation, under the rule of counter-revolutionary revisionism, the mine's capitalist roaders also treated workers as tools for 'making money, eating, and working,' completely disregarding the workers. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the working class truly became the masters of the mine." "Yes, today we are the masters, we hold the power, we must be good masters, we must hold the power well, fully unleash our working class's thorough revolutionary spirit, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, revolutionize to the end, and produce new achievements!" The words of the team leader of Team Six earned a round of enthusiastic applause. Immediately, the miners were spirited, full of energy, holding high Chairman Mao's portrait and the "grab revolution, promote production" slogan board, marching forward heroically and proudly, ready to charge into battle again.

The miners, riding the momentum, with one breath, welcomed another astonishing target—251 meters.

This is truly:

The working class has high morale,
Daring to think, daring to do, daring to create,
The red heart composes a loyal chapter,
The victorious battle song soars to the clouds!

    三次大批判  三夺高指标
    （革命故事）
    希风　佩琈
    故事开讲之前，让我们大家共同学习毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。……”
    故事发生在北京西郊木城涧煤矿里：
    一天早晨，红日东升，金光四射，京西矿山，一片通红。上班的汽笛还没有拉响，木城涧煤矿革命委员会的办公室里“叮铃……叮铃……”传来了急促的电话铃声。革命委员会主任老李，抓起耳机还没有问个“哪里？”就听到：“我们千军台岩石掘进六队的工人同志们，今天要讨论七月份的掘进计划，准备拿下二四○米……”老李以为听错了，赶紧插问：“怎么？七月份拿下二四○米？”“对，请矿革委会和驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们参加我们的会。”老李没有再说什么，轻轻地放下耳机。这个工人出身的同志，理解工人的心情，了解矿上的情况，他听到这个建矿以来从未听到过的数字，思潮翻滚，浮想联翩。那是在一九六四年，矿上党内一小撮走资派，忠实地执行了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭真所推行的修正主义路线，一方面大搞“管、卡、扣、罚”，对工人阶级公开实行专政，另一方面，这些家伙，为了达到不可告人的目的，用金钱和物质作诱饵，亲自坐阵督战：调机械，挑工人，组织了一个二百余人的所谓“甲等”掘进队。可是，他们十八般武艺全用尽，拚死拚活干了一个月，结果呢？才搞了个二○三米。如今……他正在想着，解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队队员阎海涛同志大步闯了进来。还没等老李开口，阎海涛急忙说：“老李，我这就到千军台去，你还有啥交代的？”老李果断地说：“你转告大家，革命委员会支持他们！”“好！”阎海涛答了一声就动身了。当他攀上层层高坡，来到千军台的时候，岩石掘进队的大会已经开始了。只见一○一名岩石掘进工人，个个整装待发，围坐在伟大领袖毛主席画像的四周，静听着老工人、作业班长董绍山的发言：“同志们！林副主席讲过：‘最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人’。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级。有这一条，一个就顶他十个，不用说二四○米，二五○  米也不在话下！”接着就是一阵雷鸣般的掌声。“向工人同志学习！向工人同志致敬！”阎海涛带领喊了几个口号之后，就传达了矿革委会的意见，同时建议大家研究一下具体措施。
    工人阶级心最红，革命生产打先锋。经过一场充分的讨论，订下了一个“三批走资派，三夺高指标”的战斗计划。
    一搞大批判旗开得胜
    六月三十号，掘进六队的驻地红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。誓师大会在进行。革命工人同志们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的刻骨仇恨，把矿内走资派揪到了会场。首先，大批了走资派所散布的“技术第一”、“物质第一”的反革命谬论，接着，就公布了七月份掘进二四○米的计划。走资派听着，鼻子里直出冷气，支支吾吾地说了两声：“不可能！不可能！”工人们看到走资派不服气，个个怒不可遏，义正词严地当场揭露他：“过去你靠几本洋书吓唬工人，天天叫喊‘没技术就没进尺’，我们就不信你那一套，我们靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是‘愚公移山’的革命精神，定能说一不二，创造出奇迹。”“对，我们工人阶级就是要走前人没有走过的道路，创前人没有创过的奇迹！”工人们发自肺腑的誓言，铿锵有力，震荡着群山。
    毛主席挥手我前进。这天晚上，正当工人们摩拳擦掌，准备投入战斗的时候，伟大领袖毛主席接见煤矿工人的特大喜讯传到了矿山。矿工们的心啊，咚咚跳，激动的泪水啊，顺脸流。大家满怀豪情，斗志昂扬，高擎宝书，高唱战歌，在“哞——哞——”的汽笛声中投入了战斗。看吧！毛泽东思想照坑道，革命矿工心欢笑。工人们全力以赴，一马当先；解放军毛泽东思想宣传队跟班作业。作业面上叮叮当当，汽锤怒吼，火花四溅；小道轨上哗哗啦啦斗车来往，飞驰不停，好一派战斗气氛。首开纪录，一班就拿下了三个循环，掘进一○点九米，创造了建矿以来从未有过的高指标。短短的十四天时间，就把月进一二○米的国家计划完成了，表达了工人阶级对毛主席的无限忠心。
    二搞大批判再战再捷
    七月十五号，岩石掘进六队的工人们一遍又一遍地学习了伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导后，把走资派揪到了千军台坑口，针锋相对地批判了反革命修正主义分子散布的“奖金挂帅”。老工人毕希明第一个发言。他指着走资派，愤怒地质问：“你过去对我们说过‘政治挂帅，没有奖金挂帅来得快’，你们为了多采煤，创高产，竟然把新‘熊猫牌’收音机，‘飞鸽’牌自行车、大床单、大银盾拿到采煤口来收买工人，你还散布‘创造了高产，给你们摆酒宴’等来引诱工人，真是恶毒到了极点！”毕希明的发言，象匕首，象炮弹，刺中了敌人的要害，走资派在工人面前，吓得面色如土，浑身打颤，连连说：“我该死！我该死！”老毕望着敌人狼狈不堪的丑态豪迈地说：“工人阶级不是几个臭钱就可以骗得了的。我们开矿山采煤炭，是为革命，为社会主义，为毛主席争气……。”
    毕希明的一席话，道出了全体革命矿工的心愿。六队的工人们批臭了“奖金挂帅”，树立了为革命采煤的思想，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，昂首阔步，乘胜前进，又投入了第二次战斗。七月二十七号，六队工人以空前未有的英雄气概，胜利地完成了二四○米的雄伟计划。消息传来，全矿沸腾。锣鼓声，鞭炮声，鼓掌声，口号声，汇成了一片。来啦！矿革命委员会向全队祝贺来啦！祝贺千军台六队工人在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下创造了惊人的奇迹。
    三搞大批判凯歌震天
    掘进六队的工人完成了计划指标之后，并不满足。他们按计划第三次把走资派揪到现场。工人们指着走资派劈头问道：“怎么样？你的谬论当场破产了，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色矿工，已经拿下了二四○米的新纪录！”走资派吃了一惊，喃喃地说：“真佩服！真佩服！”说着象泄气的皮球低下了头。工人们虽然看到走资派彻底完蛋了，但并不以此结束战斗，他们深深懂得工人阶级是文化大革命和一切工作中的主力军，因此，个个豪情满怀，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓为人民创立新功。此刻，老工人毕希明站起身来，向毛主席像敬了个礼，尔后向大家说：“万恶的旧社会，资本家把工人叫‘煤黑子’，是伟大领袖毛主席给了我们煤矿工人以工人阶级的光荣称号；解放以来，在反革命修正主义统治下，矿上的走资派同样把工人当成‘赚钱、吃饭、干活’的工具，根本不把工人看在眼里。是伟大领袖毛主席发动了无产阶级文化大革命，工人阶级才真正做了矿山的主人。”“对，今天我们当了家，掌了权，就要当好家，掌好权，充分发挥我们工人阶级的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，革命革到底，生产再创新！”六队队长的话，博得一阵热烈的掌声。顿时，矿工们精神抖擞，干劲冲天，高举着毛主席的画像和“抓革命，促生产”的语录牌，雄赳赳，气昂昂，又杀上了战场。
    矿工们乘着大好形势，一鼓作气，又迎来了一个更惊人的指标——二五一米。
    这真是：
    工人阶级志气高，
    敢想敢干敢创造，
    红心谱出忠字篇，
    凯歌一曲冲云霄！
