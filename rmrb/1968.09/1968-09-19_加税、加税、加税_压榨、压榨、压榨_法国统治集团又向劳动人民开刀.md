The French government has recently issued a new budget that targets the working people, imposing a large number of tax increases and shifting financial difficulties onto the people.

In the first half of this year, the struggles of French workers and students dealt a heavy blow to French capitalist economics. To quell the people's struggle, the French government had hypocritically agreed to increase workers' wages. However, the issuance of the new budget has now taken back with the government's right hand what it gave with the left.

This new budget stipulates a tax increase of 23 billion francs, with the working people bearing the brunt. The tax increases cover a wide range of items, from beer and mineral water to gasoline and diesel; from birth certificates to licenses and train tickets—it's all about taxes, taxes, taxes.

Additionally, new taxes are imposed, including a significant death tax for the deceased.

Even the United Press International has noted that the French government, in order to make up for the "losses caused by the spring internal disturbances," has further increased the burden on the people through new tax collections. The cost of living for the French people has reached a new high.

### 加税、加税、加税　压榨、压榨、压榨  法国统治集团又向劳动人民开刀

    加税、加税、加税　压榨、压榨、压榨
    法国统治集团又向劳动人民开刀
    本报讯　最近，法国政府颁布一项向劳动人民开刀的新预算，规定大量增税，竭力把财政困难转嫁给人民。
    今年上半年，法国工人和学生斗争风暴沉重地打击了法国资本主义经济。法国政府为了平息人民斗争烈火，曾经假惺惺地答应给工人增加工资。但是现在新预算的颁布，使法国政府左手给工人的东西，右手又把它夺了回来。
    这项新预算规定增税二十三亿法郎，劳动人民受害最甚。增税项目五花八门，包罗万象，从喝的啤酒、矿泉水到汽油、柴油；从出生证明书到执照、火车票，都是加税、加税、加税。
    另外还规定征收新的税，其中包括死了人要付出相当高的死亡税。
    这一切连美国合众国际社也说，法国政府为了弥补“春季内部骚乱造成的损失而实行的新税收更进一步增加了老百姓的负担”，法国人民“生活费用已升到了又一高度”。
