The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the capital entered Tsinghua Garden and was warmly welcomed by revolutionary teachers and students. The propaganda team members from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory saw two familiar classmates and began a lively conversation.

As it turned out, they were old acquaintances. It was the winter of 1966 when a group of students from Tsinghua University went to the Beijing People's Machinery Factory to combine with the workers, stir up trouble, and help the factory carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The workers welcomed them into the factory with drums and gongs.

Now, the workers from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, along with the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, have come to Tsinghua University to implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and help the students carry out the educational revolution. Old friends meeting again are especially happy.

The two students talked to them about the situation of the two factions' struggle in Tsinghua University and said: "This is a struggle between two classes and two lines; the proletarian class line is the clearest, and we should express opposition to whom and support whom." The worker comrades said: "We are not here to intervene in the struggle between the two factions. We are here to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever acts in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly support; whoever acts against Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly oppose." From the students' conversation, the worker comrades felt that their bourgeois factionalism had not been completely overcome and that they must guide them onto the track of proletarian revolution.

Addressing their current thoughts, the worker comrades introduced to them how the factory strictly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The worker comrades said: Last September, our factory, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "within the proletarian class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletarian class to split into two irreconcilable factions," achieved revolutionary great unity. Soon, the factory established a revolutionary committee and launched the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Currently, the revolutionary situation in the entire factory is excellent, with production rising steadily. They told the two students that practice has proven: as long as we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we can move from victory to victory.

The worker comrades then asked them: "Have you fought against the capitalist roaders?"

The students replied: "Not deeply or thoroughly."

The worker comrades asked again: "Have you criticized the revisionist educational line?"

The students replied: "No."

The worker comrades asked again: "Have you carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation?"

The students replied: "No."

The worker comrades said: "Now, we must use a thorough revolutionary spirit to promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school. This is the actual action of following the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment."

The two students, after hearing the worker comrades' words, felt greatly enlightened. They repeatedly said: "Worker comrades truly listen to Chairman Mao's words and practice Mao Zedong Thought. We intellectuals have not yet shaken off the shackles of petty-bourgeois thought. We must definitely accept the leadership of the proletarian class, reform our worldview, and together with the worker comrades, carry out the educational revolution to the end."

    有意义的重逢
    首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队进了清华园，受到革命师生的热烈欢迎。从北京人民机器厂来的宣传队员们，见到了两位面熟的同学，就热烈地交谈起来。
    原来，他们是老相识了。那是一九六六年的冬天，清华大学的一部分同学来到北京人民机器厂和工人相结合，煽风点火，帮助工厂搞无产阶级文化大革命。工人们敲锣打鼓把他们迎进了厂里。
    现在，北京人民机器厂的工人，又随同首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队一道，来到了清华大学，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，帮助同学们进行教育革命。熟人见面，分外高兴。
    两位同学向他们谈了清华大学两派斗争的情况，并且说：这是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争；工人阶级立场最鲜明，应该表示反对谁，支持谁。工人同志说：“我们来不是介入两派斗争的，我们是来宣传毛泽东思想的，谁做的符合毛泽东思想，我们就坚决支持；谁做的不符合毛泽东思想，我们就坚决反对。”从两位同学的谈话中，工人同志感到他们的资产阶级派性还没有完全克服，必须把他们引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。
    针对他们的活思想，工人同志向他们介绍了工厂里如何紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的情况。工人同志说：去年九月，我们厂就遵照毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，实现了革命的大联合。很快，工厂又成立了革命委员会，展开了斗、批、改。当前，全厂的革命形势一派大好，生产节节上升。他们告诉两位同学说，实践证明：只要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就能从胜利走向胜利。
    工人同志接着又问他们：“你们对走资派斗了没有？”
    同学回答：“斗得不深不透。”
    工人同志又问：“对修正主义教育路线批了没有？”
    同学又答：“没有。”
    工人同志再问：“你们搞斗、批、改了没有？”
    同学答道：“没有。”
    工人同志说：“现在，我们一定要用彻底革命的精神，促进学校的斗、批、改，这才是紧跟伟大领袖毛主席战略部署的实际行动。”
    这两位同学听了工人同志的话，感到很受教育。他们连连地说：“工人同志确实最听毛主席的话，对毛泽东思想学了就用。我们这些知识分子，还没有摆脱小资产阶级思想的束缚。我们一定好好接受工人阶级的领导，改造世界观，和工人同志一起把教育革命进行到底。”
