The Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party issued a statement on August 25, strongly condemning the fascist crime of the Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The modern revisionist traitor clique in the Soviet Union and their followers, the modern revisionist traitor cliques in Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary, on the night of August 20, dispatched their armed forces to launch a sudden attack and military invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia. This is a barefaced fascist act of aggression. This action openly exposes the social-imperialist nature of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and openly exposes the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's consistent policy of great-power chauvinism and great-nation chauvinism.

The Czech revisionist Dubcek traitor clique, in the face of the Soviet social-imperialist aggression, shamelessly knelt and surrendered, actually asking the Czechoslovak people not to resist the invading army in any way. This shows that the Czech revisionist Dubcek traitor clique has not only betrayed the proletariat but has also become a traitor to the nation in the face of imperialist aggression. This act of betrayal is the result of the Czech revisionist traitor clique's consistent policy of anti-people, anti-revolution, and modern revisionism.

It is not surprising that the Soviet social-imperialists used fascist methods to occupy Czechoslovakia. This is mainly due to the long-term implementation of the revisionist line by the Soviet modern revisionists and the Czechoslovak revisionists.

The Burmese Communist Party and the Burmese people severely condemn the fascist actions of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its followers in invading and occupying Czechoslovakia, severely condemn the Czech revisionist traitor clique's repeated betrayal of the national interests of the Czechoslovak people, and resolutely support the Czechoslovak people, the Soviet people, the world proletariat, and revolutionary people who are fighting for freedom.

After the Soviet revisionist traitor clique seized power in the Soviet Union, it restored capitalism at home, ruthlessly oppressed and exploited the Soviet people, and pursued a policy of social imperialism abroad, exerting various pressures on some countries to turn them into its vassal states.

The Soviet modern revisionists, in order to redivide the world, have also made compromises and deals with the American imperialists.

American imperialism and Soviet social imperialism have common interests in opposing revolution and opposing the people; they are both enemies of the world's people and enemies of revolution. In the matter of dividing the world, they both compete with each other and make compromises with each other. The Czechoslovak event is a clear example of the two imperialist countries competing with each other and making compromises with each other, and is also a clear example proving that the two imperialist countries are the worst and biggest robbers in the world today.

The Czechoslovak people are revolutionary people with an anti-imperialist tradition. To achieve national liberation and realize socialism, they must, under the leadership of a strong, genuine proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with a spirit of selflessness and fearlessness of sacrifice, overcome various difficulties and hardships, and steadfastly wage a just armed revolutionary war against American imperialism, Soviet social imperialism, and their agents—the Dubcek modern revisionist traitor clique—to achieve victory. The Burmese Communist Party and the Burmese people firmly believe that the Czechoslovak people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will surely fulfill this historical mission and achieve final victory.

Down with Soviet modern revisionism and social imperialism!

Down with the Czech revisionist Dubcek traitor clique!

Down with American imperialism!

Victory to the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak people!

Long live Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!

    缅共中央强烈谴责苏修武装侵捷的法西斯罪行
    美帝苏修是两个最坏的大强盗
    坚决支持苏联、捷克斯洛伐克人民和各国人民反对帝修反的革命斗争
    新华社九日讯　缅甸共产党中央委员会八月二十五日发表声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行。声明全文如下：
    苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团及其追随者波兰、东德、保加利亚和匈牙利现代修正主义叛徒集团，于八月二十日夜晚，派遣他们的武装部队，以突然袭击的方式，对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事侵略和占领。这是赤裸裸的法西斯侵略行为。这一行为公开暴露了苏修叛徒集团的社会帝国主义本质，公开暴露了苏修叛徒集团一贯奉行的大国主义和大民族主义政策。
    捷修杜布切克叛徒集团在苏联社会帝国主义的侵略面前，无耻地屈膝投降，竟然要求捷克斯洛伐克人民不要对侵略军进行任何抵抗。这就说明，捷修杜布切克叛徒集团不仅背叛了无产阶级，而且在帝国主义的侵略面前成了民族败类。这个叛卖行为是捷修叛徒集团一贯推行反人民、反革命政策和现代修正主义的结果。
    苏联社会帝国主义用这种法西斯手段占领捷克斯洛伐克，是不奇怪的。这主要是由于苏联现代修正主义者和捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者长期执行修正主义路线的结果。
    缅甸共产党和缅甸人民严厉谴责苏修叛徒集团及其追随者出兵侵占捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯行为，严厉谴责捷修叛徒集团再次叛卖捷克斯洛伐克人民的民族利益的行为，坚决支持正在为争取自由而斗争的捷克斯洛伐克人民、苏联人民、世界无产阶级和革命人民的革命斗争。
    苏修叛徒集团在苏联篡夺了党政大权以后，在国内复辟了资本主义，残酷压迫和剥削苏联人民，在国外实行社会帝国主义政策，对一些国家施加种种压力，把它们变为自己的附庸国。
    苏联现代修正主义者为了重新瓜分世界，还同美帝国主义者进行了妥协和交易。
    美帝国主义和苏联社会帝国主义在反对革命、反对人民方面有着共同的利益，它们都是世界人民的敌人，都是革命的敌人；在瓜分世界问题上，它们之间又互相争夺，又互相妥协。捷克斯洛伐克事件，就是这两个帝国主义国家互相争夺又互相妥协的一个明显的例子，也是证明这两个帝国主义国家是当前世界上最坏最大的强盗的一个明显的例子。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民是具有反帝传统的革命人民。为了本民族的解放和实现社会主义，只有在以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的、坚强的、真正的无产阶级政党的领导下，以大公无私、不怕牺牲的精神，克服种种艰难困苦，坚定不移地进行反对美帝国主义、苏联社会帝国主义及其代理人——杜布切克现代修正主义叛徒集团的正义的武装革命战争，才能取得胜利。缅甸共产党和缅甸人民坚信，具有光荣革命传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民，一定能够完成这一历史使命，夺取最后胜利。
    苏联现代修正主义和社会帝国主义必败！
    捷修杜布切克叛徒集团必败！
    美帝国主义必败！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的革命斗争必胜！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
