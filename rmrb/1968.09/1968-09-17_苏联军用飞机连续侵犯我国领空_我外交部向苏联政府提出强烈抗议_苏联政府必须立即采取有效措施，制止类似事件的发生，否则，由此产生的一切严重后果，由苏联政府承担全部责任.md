Soviet Military Aircraft Repeatedly Violate China's Airspace
China's Foreign Ministry Lodges Strong Protest with Soviet Government
Soviet Government Must Immediately Take Effective Measures to Halt Such Incidents, Otherwise, All Serious Consequences Will Be the Full Responsibility of the Soviet Government

New China News Agency, September 16th—Today, the responsible official of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Bureau of our Foreign Ministry summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Razdukhov, to lodge a protest note regarding the serious incident of Soviet military aircraft violating China's airspace. The full text of the note is as follows:

Soviet Embassy in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China hereby informs you of the following regarding the serious incident of Soviet military aircraft violating China's airspace:

From August 9th to 29th, 1968, Soviet military aircraft made 29 incursions into the airspace above the Tonghua region of China's Heilongjiang Province, conducting reconnaissance, harassment, and provocative activities. Specifically, on the 9th, there were 10 incursions, on the 10th, 5 incursions, on the 12th, 5 incursions, on the 15th, 1 incursion, on the 20th, 1 incursion, on the 24th, 3 incursions, and on the 29th, 4 incursions. These Soviet military aircraft flew at very low altitudes within Chinese territory, with the lowest altitude being 30 meters, the deepest penetration being 3 kilometers, and the longest flight path being 5 kilometers.

It should be noted that in recent years, the Soviet side has consistently dispatched military aircraft to violate China's airspace. In just the past year, there have been 119 batches and 131 incursions. However, in just 21 days, such frequent, brazen, and outrageous military provocations concentrated in one region of China are rare. It is particularly noteworthy that these incursions by military aircraft occurred before and after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 20th, which is certainly not a coincidence.

The recent frequent incursions by various Soviet military aircraft into the airspace of China's Tonghua region have escalated border tensions, constituting a blatant violation and sabotage of the territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, and a new military provocation against the People's Republic of China. This incident is entirely organized and planned by the Soviet government to support its aggression against Czechoslovakia and to implement its global strategy of colluding with the United States against China, aiming to dominate the world.

The Chinese government strongly protests against this! The Chinese government solemnly warns the Soviet government that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will not be bullied, and China's territorial sovereignty will not be infringed upon. What you are doing now will not work on the Chinese people. The Soviet government must immediately take effective measures to halt such incidents; otherwise, all serious consequences will be the full responsibility of the Soviet government.

    苏联军用飞机连续侵犯我国领空
    我外交部向苏联政府提出强烈抗议
    苏联政府必须立即采取有效措施，制止类似事件的发生，否则，由此产生的一切严重后果，由苏联政府承担全部责任
    新华社十六日讯　今天，我国外交部苏联东欧司负责人召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，就苏联军用飞机侵犯中国领空的严重事件，向苏联驻华大使馆提出抗议照会。照会全文如下：苏联驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部，现就苏联军用飞机侵犯中国领空的严重事件，照会如下：
    一九六八年八月九日至二十九日，苏联各种军用飞机二十九架次，连续侵入中国黑龙江省同化地区上空，进行侦察、骚扰和挑衅活动。其中，九日是十架次，十日是五架次，十二日是五架次，十五日是一架次，二十日是一架次，二十四日是三架次，二十九日是四架次。这些苏联军用飞机，在中国境内都是低空飞行，飞行高度最低为三十米，侵入深度最深达三公里，飞行长度最长达五公里。
    应当指出，近年来苏联方面派遣军用飞机侵犯中国领空是一贯的，仅在最近一年内，就有一百一十九批，一百三十一架次。但是，在短短的二十一天之内，集中对中国一个地区领空进行如此频繁、如此放肆、如此猖狂的军事挑衅，则是罕见的。尤其应当指出，这些军用飞机的入侵事件，是在苏联八月二十日出兵侵略捷克斯洛伐克前后发生的，这绝不是偶然的。
    苏联各种军用飞机最近不断侵入中国同化地区领空，加剧边境紧张局势，是对中华人民共和国领土主权肆无忌惮的侵犯和破坏，是对中华人民共和国进行新的军事挑衅。这一事件完全是苏联政府为配合侵略捷克斯洛伐克的暴行，为推行联美反华、勾结美国、企图主宰世界的全球战略，有组织有计划地进行的。
    对此，中国政府向苏联政府提出强烈的抗议！中国政府严正警告苏联政府，用马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不容欺侮的，中国的领土主权绝对不容侵犯。你们现在做的那一套，对中国人民是根本行不通的。苏联政府必须立即采取有效措施，制止类似事件的发生，否则，由此产生的一切严重后果，由苏联政府承担全部责任。
    中华人民共和国外交部
    一九六八年九月十六日于北京
