Recently, we visited the vast grasslands of Abaga Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and deeply felt that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has brought about tremendous and profound changes to the thousand-mile grasslands. Over the past two years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen, holding high the banner of criticizing and repudiating the revisionist line, have thoroughly smashed the so-called "special theory" of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, and smashed their whole set of reactionary revisionist lines aimed at protecting the exploiting classes and restoring capitalism. The tide of mass revolutionary criticism surged forward, and a handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and unrepentant former princes, nobles, rich herdsmen, and other counter-revolutionaries were washed out. The situation in the pastoral areas is excellent. The sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the thousand-mile grasslands and into the hearts of the herdsmen. A mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is flourishing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen are filled with the joy of victory.

Not Understanding Exploitation Means Not Understanding Revolution

The vast revolutionary criticism in Abaga Banner was launched on the basis of a large-scale mass movement of airing grievances. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Due to the correct conduct of the movement to air grievances (to air the sufferings inflicted by the old society and the reactionaries on the laboring masses) and the Three Checks (checking class status, work, and fighting spirit), the awareness of the entire army's officers and soldiers to fight for the liberation of the exploited laboring masses, for the land reform of the entire country, and for the annihilation of the enemy of the people, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, was greatly heightened; at the same time, the entire army's officers and soldiers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were greatly strengthened in their firm unity." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, Abaga Banner extensively launched the "Two Airings" (airing the sufferings of exploitation by the exploiting classes and the sufferings of the reactionary revisionist line and bourgeois dictatorship implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia) movement. This movement is the catalyst for class struggle in the pastoral areas and the powerful driving force for sustained revolutionary criticism, greatly promoting the in-depth development of the Cultural Revolution in the pastoral areas.

Before liberation, under the brutal exploitation and oppression of Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, princes, nobles, rich herdsmen, and reactionary religious upper-class elements, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen lived in a world of darkness. Which yurt does not have a history of blood and tears? Which slave does not have class hatred? "The night is long, the grass is green, the wolves are in cahoots! They cover the earth and the sky, they boil bones for meals. They are like cattle and horses, their hatred is like the sea, how can they see the blue sky!" This was a depiction of the miserable lives of the poor herdsmen in those days.

During the Cultural Revolution, these poor herdsmen who had suffered for generations, through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," grasped Chairman Mao's thoughts on class, class struggle, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. To further distinguish between friends and enemies, they organized a mass movement to air grievances. Through the typical cases of deeply aggrieved poor old herdsmen, they stirred up the sufferings of the exploiting classes. Old Madame Zhaogede'er of Baogedaola Commune was taken away by the prince at the age of fifteen to be a slave. Later, when the prince's concubine fell ill, she was taken away to be a "scapegoat" and was to be burned alive. She miraculously escaped, wandered through four banners for fourteen years, and experienced various unbearable oppressions. Old Madame's blood-curdling accusations struck hard at the class enemies and were deeply imprinted in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen.

When the broad masses of herdsmen aired their sufferings under the oppression of the exploiting classes, they sharply raised three questions: Who protected the exploiting classes after liberation? What reactionary policies and lines did they adopt to protect the class enemies? What were their sinister and evil purposes? The large number of facts exposed in the revolutionary criticism made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen deeply realize that the Chinese Khrushchev and the "contemporary princes" of Inner Mongolia were the spokesmen and protectors of the class enemies within the Party. Their stubbornly pushed "three nos" (not distinguishing, not struggling, not classifying classes) and "two benefits" (benefiting both herdsmen and herdsmen workers) and other reactionary revisionist lines were aimed at protecting the interests of the exploiting classes, maintaining the exploiting system, and ultimately achieving the goal of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. Under the guidance of the reactionary revisionist line, in 1966, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of Abaga Banner, under the pretext of lamb deaths, carried out white terror in the Baiyinchagan Commune's Baiyinwula Production Brigade, persecuting the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen for three days and three nights, removing the brigade leader position of poor herdsman Sangjiazhab, and punishing him to pick manure for the herdsmen (truly reactionary to the extreme)! With the support of the capitalist-roaders, the herdsmen and rich herdsmen usurped various powers, some became the leaders of the livestock management groups, some became members of the brigade management committee, and some became "models" and "representatives." These fellows implemented the "new Suluke" (a form of exploitation), received fixed incomes, bonuses, and unlimitedly developed private livestock, undermined the collective economy, and exploited the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen. For a time, they turned the Baiyinwula Production Brigade into a chaotic mess, and the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen said they were as greedy as wolves, "swallowing cows with fur and sheep with dung." When recalling the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines since liberation, an old active member of the pastoral reform pointed out in indignation: "Every time we rise up in revolution, it is the reactionary lines and policies of the Chinese Khrushchev and the 'contemporary princes' of Inner Mongolia that have suppressed us. The Chinese Khrushchev and the 'contemporary princes' of Inner Mongolia are the root cause of the restoration of capitalism. The reactionary bourgeois line they push is the lifeline of the exploiting classes and the death line of the poor herdsmen!"

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "If you do not understand what class is, if you do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." Through airing grievances, the broad masses of poor herdsmen in Abaga Banner quickly aroused deep hatred towards all exploiting classes and raised their consciousness to the level of the struggle between the two lines, thereby making the revolutionary criticism in the entire banner as fiery as fire.

The Main Force in the Cultural Revolution in the Pastoral Areas

In this struggle, the active members of the pastoral reform played a vanguard role. They used their personal experiences of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines to deeply expose the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia in restoring capitalism. Old Man Zhangbula Simuteng, the former chairman of the Abaga Banner Herdsmen's Association, did just that.

In 1947, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the Party led the poor herdsmen of Abaga Banner to launch a democratic revolutionary movement of class delineation, struggling against the herdsmen, dividing livestock, and achieving liberation. Old poor herdsman Zhangbula Simuteng aired his grievances at the meeting, took the lead in struggling against the herdsmen, and the movement developed rapidly. The poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen held their heads high, and the class enemies lost their prestige. But at this time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia threw out the "three nos" and "two benefits" policies, protecting the exploiting classes and supporting the class enemies in counterattacking. Zhangbula Simuteng and other active members of the pastoral reform were one by one knocked down.

During the period of cooperation and commune, the active members of the pastoral reform repeatedly rose up to struggle, but were suppressed by their "three-character policy" (the so-called "policy should be stable, methods should be broad, and time can be long"). The great socialist education movement once again ignited the revolutionary flames, and the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Inner Mongolia even advocated "thousands of rules, the first rule is to develop livestock," using production to suppress revolution. After the issuance of the "Twenty-three Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen of Abaga Banner were overjoyed and directly went to Beijing to welcome the "Twenty-three Articles" with decorated carriages. Zhangbula Simuteng told everyone: "The 'Twenty-three Articles' spoke the words of the poor herdsmen's hearts." From the socialist education movement to the Cultural Revolution, the old man, regardless of day or night, rode fast horses from one livestock group to another and from one yurt to another, airing the sufferings of the bourgeois reactionary line, quickly raising the masses' consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. In August 1966, when the Red Guards in Beijing smashed the "four olds" of the exploiting classes on the streets of Beijing, the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen of the Baiyinchagan Commune, led by the active members of the pastoral reform, directed their struggle at the capitalist-roaders who had always protected the ghosts and snakes and persecuted the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen in this banner. Since then, they have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle and have always fiercely criticized the various crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia.

The Baiyinxili Production Brigade of Baiyinchagan Commune has only forty households of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen. As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, when the crimes of the "contemporary princes" of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were just exposed and some people were still half-believing and half-doubting, these forty poor herdsmen bravely stood up and held the first revolutionary criticism meeting on the Abaga grasslands, mercilessly exposing and criticizing the eight crimes of the "contemporary princes" in madly opposing the great leader Chairman Mao and promoting nationalism. Up to now, this brigade has held more than 120 various types of criticism meetings.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the banner in January, while systematically carrying out criticism in various communes and brigades, they exposed all the herdsmen, rich herdsmen, and other counter-revolutionaries who had been protected by the Chinese Khrushchev and the "contemporary princes" of Inner Mongolia and had been doing evil, and fiercely criticized their long-term crimes of opposing socialism.

Thus, the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen, in the two years of the Cultural Revolution, have always held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing bravely, and directing the spearhead of the struggle firmly at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, criticizing them to the point of being stinkingly rotten.

The revolutionary criticism has greatly boosted the morale of the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen and greatly demoralized the class enemies. In the past, the yurts of the herdsmen were set in the clean upwind direction, while the yurts of the poor herdsmen were set in the dirty downwind direction. Now, everything is reversed, and the yurts of the poor herdsmen are all set in the upwind direction. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen said with deep affection: "It is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao that has liberated us for the second time!" "Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

The "Special Theory" Has Completely Collapsed

The revolutionary criticism in Abaga Banner has been carried out vigorously and persistently in various communes, districts, and yurts, showing the unprecedented scale and majestic momentum of the revolutionary mass movement. Their struggle has always been directed at the reactionary "special theory" pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the "contemporary princes" of Inner Mongolia, criticizing it to the point of being stinkingly rotten.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "National struggles, after all, are a class struggle issue." However, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Inner Mongolia region openly shouted about "the essence of class struggle is the national issue" and long advocated the so-called pastoral characteristics, national characteristics, and livestock characteristics, that is, the absurd and reactionary "special theory," madly resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They used the excuse that the herdsmen were engaged in capitalist economics, different from the landlords, and therefore threw out a set of reactionary policies of "not distinguishing, not struggling, not classifying classes" and "benefiting both herdsmen and herdsmen workers" for the herdsmen early on, advocating the "three-character policy" (the so-called "policy should be stable, methods should be broad, and time can be long"), attempting to resist the socialist transformation of livestock. In the revolutionary criticism, the herdsmen and cadres of the entire banner mercilessly exposed the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in protecting the exploiting classes and other counter-revolutionaries. At the criticism meeting, the herdsmen angrily said: "After liberation, the capitalist-roaders within the Party kept saying that the pastoral areas were special in this way and that way, just not letting us follow the example of the whole country to thoroughly eliminate the feudal system of the herdsmen, we were very dissatisfied at that time. At that time, it was clear that the herdsmen had been oppressing us for a long time, but they did not let us struggle. It was clear that there were classes in the pastoral areas, but they did not let us classify. It was clear that the herdsmen had exploited us, but they did not let us divide. Now we know that all this was done by the Chinese Khrushchev and the 'contemporary princes' of Inner Mongolia."

The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Inner Mongolia also used the excuse of pastoral characteristics and, in 1962, under the pretext of protecting the grasslands, ordered the pastoral areas to "close" the vast grain, vegetable, and feed bases jointly cultivated by the Mongol and Han laboring people. Some even maliciously spread the idea that "too many vegetables would press down the fragrance of mutton, and too many Han people would press down the prestige of the Mongols." They even drove away a large number of farmers who had migrated from other places. The poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen of Abaga Banner were very indignant about this and, at the criticism meetings in various communes and brigades, the herdsmen not only fiercely criticized the "contemporary princes" of Inner Mongolia for disregarding the vital interests of the herdsmen but also deeply exposed their political intrigues of promoting national separatism, thereby greatly strengthening the unity of the people of all nationalities in the pastoral areas. The herdsmen said: "We poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen and poor and lower-middle-level peasants were all sufferers in the old society, and national kinship is not as close as class kinship!" After the criticism, now the Mongol and Han laboring people on the Abaga grasslands are working together again to cultivate grain and feed bases, afforest, and jointly build a socialist new grassland. The young intellectuals who have settled here from Beijing and other places are all regarded as their own children by the herdsmen.

In the Cultural Revolution, the herdsmen of Abaga Banner, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly and meticulously criticized the reactionary revisionist line pushed by the "contemporary princes" of Inner Mongolia, thoroughly tearing off the "national" facade of the class enemies, and criticizing their "special theory" to the point of being in a state of complete collapse.

Now, the series of latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, and all the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, are, as in other parts of the country, being carried out with the most resolute and swift actions on the Abaga grasslands.

The People of the Grasslands Are Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen of Abaga Banner, through long-term and sharp class struggles, have come to deeply understand that Chairman Mao is the only savior of the people of all nationalities in the country, that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen, and that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen. They have come to understand that only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can the revolutionary people achieve thorough victory and thorough liberation. Thus, a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is flourishing on the Abaga grasslands.

Look, every time the sun rises, millions of herdsmen sing "The East Is Red" facing the direction of the sunrise, sincerely wishing our great leader Chairman Mao a long life, a long, long life! They hold the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and study Chairman Mao's instructions. In the evening, they seriously check and implement the situation of Chairman Mao's instructions. One day, after poor herdsman Dundub drank his morning milk tea, he rode his horse to herd the cattle. Halfway, he suddenly realized that he had not brought his "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He immediately turned his horse around and rushed back to the yurt to bring his beloved book. He said with a guilty heart while running: "Mao Zedong Thought is our soul. We can go a day without drinking milk tea and eating meat, but we will lose our way if we are away from Chairman Mao's teachings for a moment." Another old woman, Ajie, in her dying moments, instructed others to open the box and take out a red cloth package. She personally opened layer after layer of red cloth, and finally revealed a shining gold Mao badge. The old woman affectionately instructed the people beside her: "Please hand over my most beloved Mao badge to the Poor and Lower-Middle-Level Herdsmen's Association, so that the poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen can be loyal to Chairman Mao for generations!" The old woman's instructions represent the hopes of the older generation and speak for the hearts of millions of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Inner Mongolia region fiercely resisted the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. According to the statistics of the Narinbolige Commune, before the Cultural Revolution, the entire commune had only more than ten copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and the cadres and herdsmen could only study by printing the "Three Articles." Now, every place and every yurt in the entire banner have complete sets of Chairman Mao's works, and everyone has a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming like flowers after rain on the grasslands. Since this year, the entire banner has held more than 2,300 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 86,000 participants, equivalent to four times the population of the entire banner.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle-level herdsmen are eager to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Sangjewang, an active member in studying Chairman Mao's works and a former slave from the Narinbolige Commune, continued to study Chairman Mao's works every day even after losing his sight. Every day after getting up, the first thing he did was to "wish Chairman Mao a long life, a long, long life!" Then he started reading every day. Unable to see, he asked others to read for him, read a section, and memorize a section. Over the past two years, the old man has memorized the "Five Articles," "The Working Method of the Party Committee," and more than a hundred quotations. In addition, the old man also listened to Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and all the orders issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in a timely manner through the radio. During the Cultural Revolution, the old man always regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought as his most sacred duty. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor, and without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no liberation of slaves!" After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great unity were issued in September last year, the old man was extremely excited, disregarding his blindness and weakness, and used a cane to go to the Baiyinsile Production Brigade where the two factions were opposed, entering every yurt to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using his own experiences of being exploited to propagate the idea that the poor of the world are one family, promoting the great unity of the two factions. After Chairman Mao's instructions on holding study classes were issued, the old man promptly organized the herdsmen of three livestock groups to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes and took the lead in struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The masses were deeply moved, and an old man in his seventies said to his children: "You should learn from Sangjewang, with one heart following Chairman Mao to revolution!"

    革命洪流荡涤着千里草原
    ——访内蒙古自治区阿巴嘎旗
    最近，我们访问了内蒙古自治区的阿巴嘎旗大草原，深切感到毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场文化大革命，给千里草原带来了巨大而深刻的变化。两年多来，广大贫下中牧和革命群众高举毛泽东思想的批判旗帜，彻底砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人的所谓牧区“特殊论”，粉碎了他们拚命推行的一整套保护剥削阶级、复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义路线。群众革命大批判的洪流汹涌澎湃，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的王公贵族、牧主、富牧以及其他反革命分子，纷纷被冲刷出来。牧区形势一片大好。毛泽东思想的阳光照遍了千里草原，照进了牧民的心坎，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正蓬蓬勃勃开展起来。广大贫下中牧充满了胜利的喜悦。
    不懂得剥削　就不懂得革命
    阿巴嘎旗波澜壮阔的革命大批判，是在大规模的群众性的诉苦运动基础上开展起来的。毛主席早就指出：“由于诉苦（诉旧社会和反动派所给予劳动人民之苦）和三查（查阶级、查工作、查斗志）运动的正确进行，大大提高了全军指战员为解放被剥削的劳动大众，为全国的土地改革，为消灭人民公敌蒋介石匪帮而战的觉悟性；同时就大大加强了全体指战员在共产党领导之下的坚强的团结。”遵循毛主席的教导，阿巴嘎旗广泛开展了“两诉”（即诉剥削阶级压迫剥削之苦，诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古地区代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线和实行资产阶级专政压迫之苦）运动。这个运动是牧区开展阶级斗争的催化剂，是持久进行革命大批判的强大动力，大大促进了牧区文化大革命的深入发展。
    阿巴嘎旗解放前，在日本帝国主义、国民党反动派、王公贵族、牧主、反动宗教上层分子的残酷剥削和压迫下，广大贫下中牧过着暗无天日的生活，那一个蒙古包没有血泪史？那一个奴隶没有阶级仇？“夜长长，草青青，狼狈为奸！铺着地，盖着天，熬骨当餐。做牛马，仇似海，怎见青天！？”这是当年贫苦牧民苦难生活的写照。
    在文化大革命中，这些世世代代受苦受难的贫苦牧民通过学习毛主席《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作，掌握了毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的思想，为了进一步分清敌、我、友，重新组织起革命的阶级队伍，他们广泛地开展了群众性的诉苦运动，通过苦大仇深的贫苦老牧民做典型，以苦引苦，大揭剥削阶级的罪恶。宝格达乌拉公社昭格德尔老大娘，十五岁被王爷抓去当奴隶，以后王爷小老婆生病，又被抓去当“替死鬼”，要活活烧死。她侥幸逃了出来，辗转四个旗，流浪了十四年，经历了各种难以忍受的压迫。大娘一声声的血泪控诉，狠狠打在阶级敌人身上，印在贫下中牧的心里。
    广大牧民群众在诉剥削阶级压迫之苦时，尖锐地提出了三个问题：解放以后是谁保护了剥削阶级？他们采取了哪些反革命方针和政策来保护阶级敌人？他们妄图达到什么不可告人的罪恶目的？在革命大批判中揭露出来的大量事实，使广大贫下中牧深刻认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古的“当代王爷”就是阶级敌人在党内的代言人、保护人。他们顽固推行的“三不”（不分、不斗、不划阶级）、“两利”（牧主、牧工两利）等一整套反革命修正主义路线，就是为了保护剥削阶级利益、维护剥削制度，最终达到取消无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的目的。在反革命修正主义路线指导下，一九六六年阿巴嘎旗党内一小撮走资派借口羊羔死亡，在白音查干公社白音乌拉大队实行白色恐怖，整了贫下中牧三天三夜，撤销了贫牧桑杰札布的队长职务，罚他给牧主拾粪（真是反动透顶）！在走资派支持下，牧主、富牧等篡夺了各种大权，有的当了浩特长（畜群管理组长），有的当了大队管委会委员，有的成了“模范”、“代表”。这些家伙放“新苏鲁克”（一种剥削制度）、拿定息、得奖金，无限制地发展自留畜，摧残集体经济，剥削贫下中牧。一时间，把白音乌拉大队搞得乌烟瘴气，贫下中牧说他们象恶狼一样贪婪得“把牛连毛吞掉，把羊连粪噬光”。回忆解放以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史时，一位牧改时候的老积极分子气愤地指出：“我们每次起来革命，都是中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古‘当代王爷’的反革命路线、政策把我们压住了。中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古的‘当代王爷’，就是复辟资本主义的总根子。他们推行的资产阶级反动路线是剥削阶级的生命线，是贫苦牧民的死亡线！”
    林副主席指出：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”阿巴嘎旗广大贫苦牧民通过诉苦，迅速激起了对一切剥削阶级的刻骨仇恨，并把自己的觉悟很快提高到两条路线斗争的纲上来，从而使全旗的革命大批判搞得如火如荼。
    牧区文化大革命中的主力军
    在这场斗争中，牧区改革积极分子起了先锋作用。他们用亲身经历的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，深刻揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。原旗牧民会主任占布拉三木腾老人就是这样做的。
    一九四七年，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，党领导阿巴嘎旗的贫苦牧民掀起了划阶级、斗牧主、分牲畜、闹翻身的民主革命运动。老贫牧占布拉三木腾在诉苦会上倒了苦水，带头斗牧主，运动迅猛发展，贫下中牧扬眉吐气，阶级敌人威风扫地。但就在这时，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人抛出了“三不”“两利”政策，保护剥削阶级，支持阶级敌人反攻倒算。占布拉三木腾和其他牧改积极分子被一一打下去了。
    合作化、公社化时期，牧改积极分子一再起来斗争，又被他们的“稳、宽、长”（即所谓“政策要稳，办法要宽，时间可以长”）三字方针压住。伟大的社会主义教育运动再一次点燃了革命烈火，中国赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古的代理人竟宣扬什么“千条万条，发展牲畜第一条”，以生产压革命。毛主席亲自主持制订的《二十三条》发布后，阿巴嘎旗的贫下中牧欢喜若狂，扎好彩车直接到北京迎来《二十三条》，占布拉三木腾逢人便说：“《二十三条》说出了穷苦牧民的心里话。”从社会主义教育运动到文化大革命，老人不管白天黑夜，骑着快马从一个浩特（即畜群组）奔到另一个浩特，从一个蒙古包走到另一个蒙古包，大诉资产阶级反动路线之苦，迅速提高群众两条路线斗争觉悟。一九六六年八月，北京红卫兵在北京街头大破剥削阶级“四旧”时，老人所在的白音查干公社的贫下中牧，在牧改积极分子的率领下，就把斗争矛头对准了这个旗里一贯包庇牛鬼蛇神，打击贫下中牧的走资派，以后一直牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人的各种罪行。
    白音查干公社的白音希力大队，只有四十户贫下中牧。文化大革命一开始，内蒙古自治区“当代王爷”的罪恶刚揭发出来，有些人还在半信半疑时，这四十户贫苦牧民就勇敢地站出来，在阿巴嘎草原上第一次召开了革命的批判大会，无情地揭发和批判了“当代王爷”疯狂反对伟大领袖毛主席、大搞民族分裂主义的八条罪行。到现在为止，这个队已召开各种类型的批判大会一百二十多次。
    今年一月旗革委会成立后，各社队在系统开展批判的同时，把过去在中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古“当代王爷”包庇下为非作歹的牧主、富牧和其他反革命分子统统揭露出来，狠狠批判了他们多年来反对社会主义的罪行。
    贫下中牧就这样在文化大革命两年来，始终高举革命的批判大旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，勇往直前，把斗争矛头紧紧对准中国赫鲁晓夫和他在内蒙古的代理人，把他们批得臭不可闻。
    革命大批判大长了贫下中牧的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。过去牧主的蒙古包都设在干净的上风头，贫苦牧民的蒙古包设在肮脏的下风头，现在完全颠倒过来了，贫苦牧民的蒙古包统统设在上风头上。广大贫下中牧无限深情地说：“是毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命第二次解放了我们！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    “特殊”论完全破产了
    阿巴嘎旗的革命大批判，在各社队、各片、各蒙古包内轰轰烈烈地开展起来，坚持下去，显示了革命群众运动的空前规模和赫赫声势。他们的斗争锋芒一直指向中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古“当代王爷”推行的那一套反动透顶的“特殊”论，把它批得臭不可闻。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”而中国赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古地区的代理人，却公开叫嚷什么“阶级斗争的实质是民族问题”，并长期宣扬什么牧区特点、民族特点、牧业特点，即荒谬反动的“特殊”论，疯狂抵制毛主席的革命路线。他们借口牧主搞的是什么资本主义经济，不同于地主，因此很早就抛出了一套对牧主“不分、不斗、不划阶级”和“牧主牧工两利”的反动政策，鼓吹什么“稳、宽、长”三字方针，妄图抵制牧业社会主义改造。在革命的大批判中，全旗牧民和干部无情揭露了走资派包庇剥削阶级和其他反革命分子的罪行。在批判大会上，牧民愤怒地说：“解放后，党内走资派口口声声说牧区这也特殊，那也特殊，就是不让我们照全国的样子，彻底消灭牧主封建制度，我们当时很不满意，那时候，明明牧主长期压迫我们，就是不叫斗，明明牧区有阶级，就是不让划，明明牧主剥削了我们，就是不叫分，现在才知道这都是中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古‘当代王爷’搞的鬼。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古的代理人还借口什么牧业特点，在一九六二年以保护草场为名，下令牧区把由蒙汉族劳动人民共同开垦的大片粮食、蔬菜、饲料基地，统统加以“封闭”。还有人恶毒散布说：“菜多了压了羊肉的香味，汉人多了压了蒙人的威风。”他们竟然把外地迁来的大量农民赶走。阿巴嘎旗贫下中牧对此十分气愤，在各社队的批判会上，牧民们不仅狠批内蒙古的“当代王爷”置牧民切身利益于不顾，并且深入揭发他们大搞民族分裂的政治阴谋，因而大大加强了牧区各族人民的团结。牧民们都说：“我们贫下中牧和贫下中农旧社会都是受苦人，民族亲不如阶级亲！”经过大批判，现在阿巴嘎草原上蒙汉族劳动人民又一起重新开垦粮食、饲料基地，大搞植树造林，共同建设社会主义新草原。北京等地来这里落户的知识青年，牧民们都把他们当成自己的亲生子女看待。
    在文化大革命中，阿巴嘎旗的牧民们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入细致地对内蒙古“当代王爷”推行的反革命修正主义路线逐一加以批判，彻底撕破了阶级敌人打出的那个“民族”幌子，把他们的“特殊”论打了个落花流水。
    现在，伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令，在阿巴嘎草原如同在全国其他地方一样，得到了最坚决最迅速的贯彻执行。
    草原人民永远忠于毛主席
    阿巴嘎旗的广大贫下中牧在长期尖锐的阶级斗争中，愈加深刻地认识到毛主席是全国各族人民唯一的救星，毛泽东思想是贫下中牧的命根子，毛主席的革命路线是贫下中牧的生命线。他们更加懂得了只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，革命人民才能得到彻底胜利，彻底解放。于是，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动在阿巴嘎草原广泛开展起来。
    看吧，每当红日初升的时候，千万个牧民向着太阳升起的地方放声歌唱《东方红》，衷心祝愿我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！他们手捧红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，学习毛主席的指示，晚上又认真检查落实毛主席指示的情况。有一天贫牧敦德布早晨喝完奶茶，骑了马赶着牛去放牧，半路上忽然发觉《毛主席语录》没有带来，立刻掉转马头，飞奔回蒙古包带上了心爱的宝书。他一边跑一边怀着内疚的心情说：“毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，一天不喝奶茶，不吃肉可以，一时一刻离开毛主席的教导就要迷失方向。”还有一位阿吉（老妈妈）在她生命垂危的时候，示意别人打开箱子，拿出一个红布包。她亲手打开层层红布，最后露出一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章，老人深情地嘱咐着身旁的人：“请把我最心爱的毛主席像章交给贫协，让贫下中牧世世代代忠于毛主席！”这位阿吉的嘱咐代表着老一代的希望，说出了千千万万个贫下中牧的心里话。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古地区的代理人，拚命抵制毛泽东思想的传播，据那仁宝力格公社统计，文化大革命前，全公社只有《毛泽东选集》十多部，干部牧民只能靠刻印“老三篇”学习。现在，全旗每一个地方，每一家蒙古包都有成套的毛主席著作，人人都有一册《毛主席语录》。毛泽东思想学习班，象雨后红花开遍草原。今年以来，全旗举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班二千三百多期，参加学习的人数达八万六千多人次，等于全旗人数的四倍。
    广大贫下中牧如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。学习毛主席著作积极分子、那仁宝力格公社奴隶出身的桑杰旺老人，双目失明以后，仍然坚持天天学习毛主席著作。他每天起床后第一件事，就是“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”然后开始天天读。眼睛看不见，就请别人念，念一段，背一段。两年来，老人背会了“老五篇”、《党委会的工作方法》和上百条语录。另外，老人还通过收音机及时收听毛主席一系列最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的一切号令。文化大革命中，老人一直把宣传毛泽东思想当成自己最神圣的责任。他说：“毛泽东思想是穷人的命根子，离开毛泽东思想就没有奴隶的翻身、奴隶的解放！”去年九月毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示传出后，老人激动万分，不顾眼瞎，体弱，拄着拐棍到两派对立的白音锡勒大队，深入到每一个蒙古包宣传毛主席的最新指示，用自己受剥削的遭遇，宣传天下穷人是一家的道理，促进了两派大联合。毛主席办学习班的指示传出后，老人又及时组织三个浩特的牧民办起了毛泽东思想学习班，带头斗私批修。群众非常感动，一位七十多岁的老人对自己的孩子说：“你们要向桑杰旺学习，一个心眼跟着毛主席干革命！”
    跟着毛主席，牧民得翻身！
    跟着毛主席，草原一片红！
