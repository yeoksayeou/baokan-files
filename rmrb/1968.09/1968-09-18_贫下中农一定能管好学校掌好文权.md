The practice of class struggle has taught us that the education sector must be managed by the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants themselves in order to truly serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Our Luojiayu production brigade has a primary school. In the past, under the influence of the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, it became a place detached from workers and peasants, detached from politics, a "little city in the mountains."

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although this mountain village school was also impacted, due to the lingering influence of the revisionist educational line, some students were incited by class enemies and influenced by anarchist thoughts, refusing to follow correct leadership, often causing trouble, and even damaging public property. After learning about this, we poor and lower-middle peasants, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, went to the school and worked with revolutionary teachers and students to first organize a revolutionary big-character poster campaign. We used the facts of how poor and lower-middle peasants were exploited and oppressed in the old society to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. This greatly raised the political consciousness of the teachers and students, exposed the school's capitalist roaders, purified the teaching staff, quickly stabilized the school's order, and promoted the deepening of the struggle-criticism-transformation.

We also often organize students to participate in collective productive labor, closely combining education with productive labor. The school's material construction is also handled by us poor and lower-middle peasants according to the principle of "frugality for revolution," self-reliance, and helping to solve problems. If teaching aids are broken, we proactively send people to help repair them. If something is missing, we find a way to add it. In the past year, our brigade has expanded the school by building more than ten classrooms without asking the state for a single cent.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions further point out the direction for the victory of the educational revolution. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's trust in us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will certainly, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the school, manage the school well, hold cultural power, and carry the educational revolution to the end.

### 贫下中农一定能管好学校掌好文权

    贫下中农一定能管好学校掌好文权
    阶级斗争的实践告诉我们，教育事业必须由工人阶级、贫下中农自己掌管起来，才能真正为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。
    我们罗家峪大队有一所小学，过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的影响下，成了一个脱离工农、脱离政治的世外桃源。贫下中农气愤地说它是“山沟里的小城市”。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这所山村小学校虽然也受到了冲击，但是，由于修正主义教育路线的流毒还未彻底肃清，一部分学生受了阶级敌人的挑动和无政府主义思潮的影响，不听从正确的领导，经常捣乱，甚至破坏公共财物。我们贫下中农知道后，就遵照毛主席的教导，到学校和革命师生一起，首先组织大家开展革命大批判，用贫下中农在旧社会受剥削受压迫的事实，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了师生的无产阶级政治觉悟，揪出了学校的走资派，纯洁了教师队伍，很快稳定了学校的秩序，推动了斗、批、改的深入开展。过去毁坏公物的同学，现在看见公家的东西坏了就主动地维护修理，学校的面貌焕然一新。
    我们还经常组织学生参加集体生产劳动，使教育和生产劳动紧紧地结合在一起。学校的物质建设也是由我们贫下中农根据“节约闹革命”的原则，自力更生，帮助解决。教具坏了，我们主动派人帮助修理，缺少什么，我们设法添置。近一年来我们大队就为学校扩建了十来间教室，未向国家要一文钱。
    毛主席的最新指示，更进一步地为我们指出了教育革命的胜利方向。我们决不辜负毛主席他老人家对俺们贫下中农的信任，一定要在毛主席教育革命的最新指示指引下，搞好学校的斗、批、改，管好学校，掌好文权，把教育革命进行到底。
