The entire country, excluding Taiwan Province, has established revolutionary committees, achieving a red landscape across the nation. The joyous news spread to the frontlines of the sea defense and border guards, immersing them in festive joy. The soldiers and officers fighting on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist frontlines cheerfully shouted and sang with all their hearts. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" Their shouts drowned out the waves of the sea and the rustling of the pine trees in the deep mountains. On this brilliant day, the heroic soldiers solemnly vowed: Chairman Mao, we will definitely hold our guns tightly and, together with the people of all ethnic groups, build the country's borders into an iron great wall.

Fujian Frontline Sailors: Strengthen War Readiness, Strengthen Sea Defense, and Be Ready to Liberate Taiwan at Any Time

A red sun shines over the vast sky, and the mountains and rivers across the country are red. The joyous news of the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, except Taiwan Province, reached the sailors of a certain escort boat in Fujian. The sailors were so excited that their blood boiled and tears of joy flowed. They held the red revolutionary book, caressed the glorious boat, and reviewed the course of the Cultural Revolution, expressing their determination: They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, strengthen war readiness, strengthen sea defense, and be ready to annihilate any invading enemy and liberate Taiwan at any time.

Comrade Wang Deshen, the political instructor who had just returned from the Beijing Navy's Four Good Units Representatives Conference, was particularly moved. The scene of the great leader Chairman Mao warmly receiving the navy soldiers floated before his eyes again. He said excitedly at the advanced individuals' meeting on the boat: "The red landscape across the country is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It signifies that the storm of struggle, criticism, and transformation has arrived nationwide. This is truly victory upon victory, joyous news upon joyous news!"

This is a heroic escort boat. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the sailors, with their loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely and tenaciously patrolled the turbulent Taiwan Strait day and night. Year after year, through harsh winters and scorching summers, they fought bravely against the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, foiling their evil plots to carry out sabotage activities at sea time and time again, achieving glorious victories. Today, these heroic sailors who have repeatedly won victories in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are even more vigilant. They repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the cunning plots of revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs."

During a naval battle, the soldier Mei Guohua, who was the first to jump onto the enemy ship and bring the captives onto his own boat, firmly declared after studying Chairman Mao's great teachings: He will forever follow Chairman Mao, go wherever Chairman Mao points, and achieve new victories for defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and liberating Taiwan, our sacred national territory.

Heroic Pilots: Fight to Defend the Country's Airspace for Life

The joyous news reached a certain independent flight squadron of the air force that was on duty near the warplanes. The outstanding pilot Tian De'an found the best red paper and wrote in large characters: "Joyously Celebrate the Red Landscape Across the Country." The pilots gathered around Chairman Mao's portrait and sang loudly, "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!"

The celebration began by the warplanes. Hu Jingchun, the squadron leader who was once a poor farmer from the Inner Mongolian grasslands, gazed at Chairman Mao's portrait, and memories flooded his mind. In the old society, Hu Jingchun's family had been working for the landlord for generations. At the age of eight, he herded cattle and sheep for the landlord and endured the landlord's whip. In 1942, the wicked Japanese imperialists conducted inhuman bacteriological warfare experiments in his hometown, killing six out of seven members of his family, leaving only him. In 1946, Hu Jingchun, with his class hatred and national resentment, joined the People's Liberation Army and grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. This year, he attended the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the Air Force and saw the great leader Chairman Mao, whom he had been longing for day and night. In the joyous shouts of the red landscape across the country, he repeatedly read Chairman Mao's great teachings: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. He said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the past, you led the people of the whole country to overthrow the three big mountains, establish the revolutionary government, and liberate the working people from the hell of the old society; now, you personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, foiling the evil plots of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism, achieving a red landscape across the country, making the socialist mountains and rivers more solid than a rock. I will definitely fight to defend the Cultural Revolution and the socialist mountains and rivers."

This is a heroic flight squadron. During the Cultural Revolution, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, firmly adhering to the proletarian political line. Last year, they were rated as a Four Good Squadron, and everyone was rated as an outstanding pilot. Today, they talked more and more enthusiastically and excitedly. They solemnly vowed before Chairman Mao's portrait, holding up the revolutionary book: They will definitely build the squadron into a combat collective that is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting to defend Chairman Mao and the revolutionary government for life.

The Sentinels on Wuzhishan: Strengthen Military-Civilian Unity, Be Highly Alert, and Guard the Sea Defense Together

The joyous news reached a sea defense outpost on Wuzhishan in Hainan Island. Immediately, the loud deer skin drums were beaten, and the bonfires were lit. The soldiers, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, shouted and sang joyfully. In the excitement, some soldiers composed poems on the spot, celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; some made solemn vows, expressing their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. The fourth squad leader Fu Shigang wrote: "Wuzhishan is full of tea flowers, but the Cultural Revolution reports are even more numerous; the wood cotton flowers under Wuzhishan are red, but the hearts of revolutionary soldiers are the reddest; Wuzhishan peaks are high, but Chairman Mao's merits are the highest; the five rivers are deep, but Chairman Mao's grace is the deepest." The Li ethnic five-good soldier, the third squad leader Wang Chun, was once a bitter and resentful child. His parents were exploited by the "head of the field" (landlord) and suffered endless torment. He said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is because of you that we, the people of all ethnic groups, have been liberated, and the country has a red landscape. We can sing all the most beautiful mountain songs of the Li family and blow the most melodious bamboo flutes of the Miao family, but we cannot express our boundless love and loyalty to you, the old man. I will carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution and achieve new victories for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

At this joyous moment, the reconnaissance company immediately sent a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to the nearby Li village. Instantly, the remote mountain villages were in an uproar. A seventy-year-old Li ethnic poor farmer, Huang Lizhi, tightly held the propaganda team member's hand and said: Tell Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget Chairman Mao's grace, nor will we forget class struggle. We must seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, manage the schools well, and follow him to the end of the revolution. The deputy platoon leader of the militia, Huang Dehai, had once fought side by side with the garrison troops, annihilating a group of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies that had infiltrated Hainan Island. He said excitedly: The class enemies are not willing to die. At the time of celebrating victory, we must strengthen our defenses, consolidate the sea defense, and build Hainan Island into an iron great wall.

"Military-civilian unity is like one person; who can defeat us in the world?" In the joyous Li village, the military and civilians repeatedly read Chairman Mao's great teachings. In the increasingly loud sound of the deer skin drums, the military and civilians sang the bright mountain songs in unison: "The hearts of the Li poor peasants are the reddest, forever following Mao Zedong; military and civilians guard the sea defense side by side, vowing to make the world red, eh, vowing to make the world red!"

The Soldiers on the Ruili River: Unite Hearts and Minds, Strengthen Military-Civilian Joint Defense

The joyous news reached the "Political Border Defense Model Company" on the Ruili River in the border areas of Yunnan. The border defense soldiers sang and danced, immersed in boundless joy.

The company, which was awarded the honorable title by the Ministry of National Defense, has, over the past decade, followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is a true copper wall and iron wall? It is the masses, it is the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution." They have established a deep revolutionary friendship with the people of dozens of villages in the defense area. They have armed the brotherly ethnic groups with Mao Zedong Thought, established a solid military-civilian joint defense, foiled various plots of class enemies, and built the border into a strong red frontline fortress. On the joyous day of celebrating the red landscape across the country, the soldiers and officers, in order to quickly spread this great joyous news to the people of all ethnic groups, immediately formed six propaganda teams and went to various villages at night to carry out propaganda activities. Wherever the propaganda teams went, there were shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The old grandmother of the Dai ethnic group, Ya Ruizhuang, in Leiyun Village, was too old to attend the meeting, so the soldiers went to her home to propagate. The old grandmother was overjoyed and excitedly said: "The red sun rises in Beijing, and the mountains and rivers across the country are illuminated! We, the Dai people, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao." The border defense soldiers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, were more vigilant while celebrating the victory, patrolling the border line with the broad masses of militiamen. They said: They will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hold high the banner of "Support the Army and Love the People," strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen war readiness, and build the country's borders into an iron great wall.

The Sentinels on the Himalayas: Standing on the Snow Mountain Peak, Heart Toward Beijing, Loyal to Chairman Mao, Defend the Border to the Death

The joyous news reached a border defense unit on the Himalayas. The soldiers sang, danced, and shouted, passionately praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shining over the country's vast rivers and mountains.

This heroic border defense unit has been fighting year-round on the ice peaks and snow mountains, fearing neither hardship nor death, and loyally standing guard on the snow mountains. Last year, they, with their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, foiled the armed provocations of the Indian reactionaries, using their blood and lives to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the country's borders. The platoon leader Yin Zhengxing, who achieved new victories in the Cultural Revolution, led a propaganda team and set out. He held Chairman Mao's portrait, unable to contain his joy, singing "The East Is Red" and "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsman" as he walked.

Yin Zhengxing, when he was a squad leader last year, once, while on solo duty at the border, with his loyal heart to defend Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the death, did not retreat a step in the face of the enemy's provocations, bravely defending the country's borders and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, he, facing the cold mountain wind, crossed mountains and valleys, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the great situation of the red landscape across the country to the nearby Tibetan people.

Wherever the propaganda team went, there was joyous excitement. Yin Zhengxing saw an old Tibetan woman with a smiling face coming towards him and immediately went up to report the joyous news to her, pinning a Chairman Mao badge on the old woman's chest. The old woman excitedly shouted: "Chairman Mao, long live!" The border defense soldiers and the Tibetan people talked intimately about following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said: They will definitely turn the vast plateau into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, building an impregnable copper wall and iron wall on the southwestern border.

The Soldiers on the Pamir Plateau: Let the Enemy Tremble Before Our Victory!

The joyous news reached a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Pamir Plateau. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, composed of soldiers and officers, immediately mounted their fast horses and rushed in all directions to spread the joyous news.

In the Ice Mountain Commune, the soldiers and officers held meetings with representatives of the poor Tajik herdsmen to convey the joyous news. The representatives were overjoyed, raising their arms and shouting: "The great savior of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, long live!" "The red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, long live!" A seventy-year-old poor herdsman, Shaparbao Yi, was so happy that he didn't know what to say. He held Chairman Mao's portrait in both hands, pressing it to his face, and shed tears of happiness.

The soldiers and officers on the Pamir Plateau have established a deep combat friendship with the local people of all ethnic groups during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have been guarding the country and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution side by side day and night. On this joyous day, the military and civilians talked intimately about the victory, expressing their determination to defend the border.

The Ice Mountain Commune was to hold a celebration meeting. The border defense soldiers and the old man Shaparbao Yi rode horses side by side towards the commune. That day, the weather was exceptionally clear, and the Mushtagh Ice Peak looked particularly magnificent. They talked as they walked, and when they reached near a pasture, Shaparbao Yi's face turned gloomy. He said to the border defense soldiers: In the past, these pastures and cattle were all the herdsmen's, and we? We had nothing! But the herdsmen's bloody whip often lashed us. Look! This leg of mine was crippled by the herdsmen's beating. When they reached the side of the Mao Zedong Thought Tower, the old man said firmly: We will definitely read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words, and we will not allow China's Khrushchev and his agents to restore capitalism in Xinjiang! We will not allow those herdsmen to oppress us again! We will definitely maintain national unity, strengthen national unity, and achieve greater victories.

Under the brilliant sunlight, the military and civilians talked about how to strengthen military-civilian unity, carry out military-civilian joint defense, raise cattle and sheep for the revolution, carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, support and defend the newly born revolutionary committees with practical actions, defend the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and build the Pamir Plateau into an indestructible iron great wall. They said: Military-civilian unity is like one person; who can defeat us in the world? Let the enemy tremble before our victory!

    毛主席啊，我们一定把祖国边疆建成钢铁长城
    ——记人民解放军海防边防战士热烈欢呼全国山河一片红
    全国除台湾省以外的省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会，实现了全国山河一片红。喜讯传来，海防前线、边防哨所沉浸在节日的欢乐中。战斗在反帝反修前哨的解放军指战员，纵情欢呼，尽情歌唱。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，压过了大海的波涛，盖过了深山密林的松涛声。在这光辉灿烂的日子里，英雄的战士庄严宣誓：毛主席啊，我们一定握紧手中枪，和各族人民一起，把祖国边疆建成钢铁长城。
    福建前线水兵：加强战备，加强海防，随时准备解放台湾
    一轮红日照长空，万里山川一片红。
    全国除台湾省外的各省、市、自治区革委会全部成立的喜讯，传到福建前线海军某护卫艇，水兵们激动得热血沸腾喜泪流，他们手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，抚摸着光荣的战艇，回顾着文化大革命的战斗历程，表达着他们的决心：永远忠于毛主席，加强战备，加强海防，随时准备歼灭敢于来犯之敌，随时准备解放台湾。
    刚从北京参加海军四好连队代表大会归来的指导员王德银，心情格外激动。伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见海军战士的情景，又一次浮现在眼前。他在艇上先进人物座谈会上激动地说：“祖国山河一片红，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。它标志着全国范围内的斗、批、改高潮已经到来。这真是胜利接着胜利，喜讯接着喜讯！”
    这是一艘英雄的护卫艇。在无产阶级文化大革命中，水兵们满怀着对伟大统帅毛主席的赤胆忠心，以无比的英勇和顽强，日日夜夜巡航在波涛汹涌的台湾海峡。长年累月，严冬酷暑，他们同美蒋匪帮展开了英勇的斗争，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人妄图在海上进行袭扰破坏活动的罪恶阴谋，赢得了辉煌的战果。今天，这些为保卫无产阶级文化大革命屡建战功的英雄水兵，更加百倍警惕。他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的伟大教导：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。
    在一次海战中，第一个跳上敌船，把俘虏一个个押上自己战艇的战士梅国华，学习毛主席的伟大教导以后，坚决表示，永远紧跟毛主席，毛主席指向那里，就打到那里，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为解放祖国神圣领土台湾立新功。
    英雄的飞行员：为保卫祖国领空战斗终生
    喜讯传到了正在战鹰旁担任战斗值班任务的空军某飞行独立中队，五好飞行员田德安找来最好的大红纸，挥笔疾书“热烈欢呼全国山河一片红”的大字标语。飞行员们簇拥着毛主席像，放声高歌《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》。
    战鹰旁的庆祝会开始了。当年内蒙古草原上的贫苦农民，如今的中队长胡景春，凝望着毛主席像，往事涌心头。在旧社会，胡景春家里祖祖辈辈给地主扛活。他八岁就给地主放牛放羊，挨地主的皮鞭。一九四二年，万恶的日本帝国主义在他家乡进行灭绝人性的细菌战试验，一家七口被杀害得只剩下他一个人。一九四六年，胡景春带着阶级仇、民族恨，参加了人民解放军，在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮成长。今年他出席了空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，见到了日夜思念的伟大领袖毛主席。在全国山河一片红的欢呼声中，他一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席的伟大教导：革命的根本问题是政权问题。他说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！过去，您领导全国人民推翻了三座大山，建立了革命政权，把劳动人民从旧社会的火坑里解放出来；如今，您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，又粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，实现了万里山河一片红，使社会主义的江山更加坚如磐石。我一定为保卫文化大革命、保卫社会主义江山而战斗。”
    这是个英雄的飞行中队。在文化大革命中，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线，坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治。去年，他们被评为四好中队，人人都评上五好飞行员。今天，大家越说越热烈，越说越激动。他们高擎革命宝书，在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：一定把连队建设成无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体，为保卫毛主席、保卫革命政权而战斗终生。
    五指山上的哨兵：加强军民团结，百倍警惕，携手并肩守海防
    喜讯传到了海南岛五指山区的一个海防哨所，这里立即擂起了响亮的鹿皮鼓，点起了熊熊的篝火，战士们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，尽情欢呼，尽情歌唱。在欢腾中，战士们有的即兴赋诗，欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利；有的当场宣誓，表达无限忠于毛主席的决心。四班长符史刚写道：“五指山上茶花多，那有文化大革命喜报多；五指山下木棉花红，那有革命战士心最红；五指山峰高又高，那有毛主席的功劳高；五条河水深又深，没有毛主席的恩情深。”黎族五好战士、三班长王春，过去是个苦大仇恨深的苦孩子，父母被“亩头”（地主）剥削，受尽折磨。他说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！有了您，才有我们各民族的解放，才有全国山河一片红。我们唱尽黎家最美好的山歌，吹遍苗家最动听的竹笛，也表达不完对您老人家的无限热爱，无限忠诚，我要发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利再立新功。”
    在尽情欢呼的时刻，警侦连连夜派出毛泽东思想宣传队赶到附近黎村。顿时，一个个偏僻的山村沸腾起来了。七十多岁的黎族老贫农黄理志紧握着宣传队员的手说：告诉毛主席他老人家，咱贫下中农永远忘不了毛主席的恩情，也永远忘不了阶级斗争，我们要认真搞好斗、批、改，管好学校，紧跟他老人家革命到底。民兵副排长黄德海曾经和驻岛部队并肩战斗，全歼了窜入海南岛的一股美蒋特务。他激动地说：阶级敌人是不甘心死亡的，在欢庆胜利的时候，我们一定要加强防卫，巩固海防，把海南岛筑成钢铁长城。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”在一片欢腾的黎村里，军民一遍又一遍地朗读着毛主席的这一伟大教导。在越擂越响的鹿皮鼓声中，军民一次又一次同声唱着嘹亮的山歌：“黎家贫下中农心最红，永远跟着毛泽东；军民并肩守海防，誓叫世界红彤彤，哎咯罗，誓叫世界一片红！”
    瑞丽江边的战士：同心协力，加强军民联防
    喜讯传到云南边疆瑞丽江边的“政治边防模范连”，边防战士载歌载舞，沉浸在无比欢乐之中。
    荣获国防部授予光荣称号的“政治边防模范连”，十几年来，遵照毛主席“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众”的教导，和防区几十个村寨的人民群众建立了深厚的革命友谊。他们用毛泽东思想武装兄弟民族，建立了巩固的军民联防，粉碎了各种阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，把边疆建设成一座坚强的红色前哨堡垒。在欢呼全国一片红的大喜日子里，指战员们为了尽快把这一特大喜讯传给各族人民，他们立即组成了六个宣传组，连夜到各个村寨，展开宣传活动。宣传组走到那里，那里就是一片“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。雷允寨傣族老大妈牙瑞庄，年老不能到会，战士们就到她的家去宣传。老大妈听到全国山河一片红的喜讯，喜气洋洋，激动地说：“北京升起红太阳，全国山河都照亮！我们傣族人民永远忠于毛主席。”无限忠于毛主席的边防战士，在欢庆胜利的时候，和广大民兵一起更加警惕地巡逻在边防线上。他们说：我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举毛主席“拥军爱民”的旗帜，加强军民团结，加强战备，把祖国的边疆建成钢铁长城。
    喜马拉雅山上的哨兵：站在雪山顶，心向北京城，忠于毛主席，誓死保边疆
    喜讯传到喜马拉雅山上的一支边防部队，战士们唱呀，跳呀，欢呼呀，热情歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照祖国万里河山。
    这支英雄的边防部队，终年战斗在冰峰雪岭之中，不怕苦，不怕死，忠心耿耿地在雪山上站岗放哨。去年，他们凭着对毛主席的无限忠心，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，粉碎了印度反动派的武装挑衅，用鲜血和生命保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，保卫了祖国边疆。在文化大革命中立了新功的排长尹正兴，带着一支宣传队出发了。他手捧着毛主席的画像，抑制不住内心的喜悦，边走边唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》。
    尹正兴在去年当班长的时候，一次在边界单独执勤时，怀着誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命的赤胆忠心，在敌人的挑衅面前，决不后退一步，英勇地捍卫了祖国边疆，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。今天，他顶着凛冽的山风，翻山越岭，热情地向驻地附近藏族群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传全国山河一片红的大好形势。
    宣传队到了那里，那里就一片欢腾。尹正兴见一位藏族阿妈满面笑容地走来，立即迎了上去向她报告喜讯，并把毛主席像章别在老人的胸前。老大妈激动地连声高呼：“毛主席赤洛丹巴学（万岁）！”边防战士和藏族人民亲密无间地畅谈紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示的决心。他们表示，一定把万里高原办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，在西南边疆筑起一道牢不可破的铜墙铁壁。
    帕米尔高原的指战员：让敌人在我们的胜利面前发抖吧！
    喜讯传到帕米尔高原的解放军某部，由指战员组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，立即骑上飞快的战马，奔向四面八方报喜。
   在冰山公社，指战员们分头召集塔吉克族贫苦牧民代表会的代表，传达喜讯。代表们闻讯后，欣喜若狂，振臂高呼：“各族人民的大救星毛主席万岁！”“各族人民心中的红太阳毛主席万岁！”七十多岁的贫苦牧民沙帕尔包依高兴得不知说什么好，双手捧起毛主席像，贴在脸上，洒下了幸福的热泪。
    帕米尔高原上的指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，与当地各族人民结下了深厚的战斗友谊。他们日日夜夜并肩保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。在这欢腾的日子里，军民亲密无间地在一起畅谈胜利，表达保卫边防的决心。
    冰山公社要举行庆祝大会，边防战士和沙帕尔包依老人骑着马，并肩朝公社奔去。这天，天气格外晴朗，慕士塔格冰峰显得格外壮丽。他们边走边谈，到了一个牧场附近，沙帕尔包依脸孔变得阴沉，他对边防战士说：过去这些牧场和牛羊全都是牧主的，我们呢？啥也没有！而牧主那带血的马鞭却不时抽打在我们身上。看！我这条腿就是叫牧主吊打残废的。到了毛主席语录塔旁，老人又坚定地说：我们一定读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，决不能让中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在新疆复辟资本主义！我们也决不允许那些牧主再压迫我们！我们一定维护祖国统一，加强民族团结，夺取更大的胜利。
    在灿烂的阳光下，军民一起畅谈着如何加强军民团结，搞好军民联防，为革命放好牛羊，搞好斗批改，用实际行动支持和保卫新生的革命委员会，保卫各族人民心中的红太阳毛主席，把帕米尔高原建成坚不可摧的钢铁长城。他们说：军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌，让敌人在我们的胜利面前发抖吧！
