It is already eleven o'clock at night, but the meeting at Dongfeng Primary School in Dongfeng Farm, Panjin, Liaoning, to "expose the cover of class struggle and dig out the class enemies" is still ongoing. Old poor peasant Liu Grandpa is studying Chairman Mao's teachings with everyone, word by word: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. With state power in our grasp everything is possible, without it nothing can be done," and "One must never be so naive as to imagine that the complex class struggle can be handled in a simple way."

Last year, when Liu Grandpa's younger son was in the fourth grade at Dongfeng Primary School, he would throw his schoolbag down as soon as he got home and start playing with an abacus. Over time, Liu Grandpa noticed this and took it to heart. One evening, he asked his son, "Why do you always play with the abacus as soon as you get home and don't do any chores?" The child happily replied, "Our teacher said that if you learn the abacus well, you can become an accountant, and you can also become a technician or an engineer!" It was then that Liu Grandpa realized that the poison of "fame and fortune" and "prestige and position" from China's Khrushchev had already infected his child's young mind. Thinking further, it was not just his own child; there were many more like this. So, he came to the school with a heart full of anger. However, the capitalist roaders in the school said nonchalantly, "Children go to school to learn real skills! You 'mud-legged' people just manage the soil; you don't need to manage the school." At that time, Liu Grandpa was so angry that he could hardly contain his rage.

Recently, the farm held a revolutionary teacher-student study class at Dongfeng Primary School. Liu Grandpa could no longer suppress his anger and packed his bag to stay at the school. Just at that moment, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued! Chairman Mao pointed out in the most timely, profound, and clear manner: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Liu Grandpa was so happy that he almost jumped up. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are truly the best and the most timely. In the past, the school was controlled by the class enemies, and we poor and lower-middle peasants had no right to manage it. Now the world belongs to us, the working people, the country belongs to us, the working people, and the school belongs to us. If we don't manage it, who will? Chairman Mao has given us the poor and lower-middle peasants the right to manage the school. We 'mud-legged' people must not only manage the soil but also manage the school."

For a long time, the cover of class struggle in this school had not been exposed. Since Liu Grandpa and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, the cover of class struggle was quickly exposed. As the struggle, criticism, and transformation deepened, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students were greatly raised.

    我们不但要管土坷垃，而且要管学校
    已经是深夜十一点钟了，辽宁盘锦东风农场东风小学召开的“狠揭阶级斗争盖子，深挖阶级敌人”的大会还在继续着。老贫农刘大爷正和大家一字一句地学习着伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切”，“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”
    去年刘大爷的小儿子在东风小学四年级念书时，每天放学回家书包一扔就拿起小算盘，扒拉起来。时间长了，刘大爷看在眼里，记在心上。一天晚上，他问小儿子：“你怎么一回家就扒拉算盘，什么活也不干呢？”孩子高兴地回答道：“我们老师说了，学好算盘将来能当会计，还可以当什么技术员、工程师呢！”刘大爷这才知道，在孩子幼小的心灵里已经中上了中国赫鲁晓夫“成名成家”、“名誉地位”的流毒。再仔细一想又何止是自己一个孩子！于是，他带着满腔怒火来找学校，谁知学校里的走资派满不在乎地说：“孩子上学就要学点真本领嘛！你们‘泥腿子’管好‘土坷垃’就行了，学校用不着你们管。”当时气得刘大爷怒火万丈。
    前些日子，农场在东风小学办中小学革命师生学习班，刘大爷再也压制不住内心的怒火了，他捆起背包，到了学校就住下了。正在这时，毛主席的最新指示发表了！毛主席最及时、最深刻、最明确地指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”刘大爷高兴得简直要跳了起来，他激动地说：毛主席的最新指示真是太好了，太及时了。过去学校被阶级敌人把持着，没有我们贫下中农管理的权力，现在的天下是我们劳动人民的天下，国家是我们劳动人民的国家，学校是我们的学校，我们不管谁管？毛主席把管理学校的权力交给了我们贫下中农，我们“泥腿子”不但要管土坷垃，而且要管学校。
    长期以来，这个学校的阶级斗争盖子一直揭不开，自从刘大爷和广大贫下中农参加学校斗、批、改以来，阶级斗争盖子很快揭开了，随着斗、批、改的深入发展，大大地提高了广大革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
