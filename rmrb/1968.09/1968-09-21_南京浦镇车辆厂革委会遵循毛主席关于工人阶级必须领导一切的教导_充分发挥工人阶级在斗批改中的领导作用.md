The Nanjing Pukou Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee follows the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class must lead everything." It fully plays the leading role of the working class in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. It selects a group of outstanding worker representatives to join the revolutionary committee, deeply and persistently carries out revolutionary criticism, and cleans up the poison of China's Khrushchev who despises the working class and advocates "expert management." It ensures the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work.

The Nanjing Pukou Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great instruction that "our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," with the help of the PLA's supporting-leftist troops stationed in the factory, fully plays the leading role of the working class in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This has made the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation continuously deepen and achieve great success.

This factory is an influential large factory in Nanjing. Since the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcome the interference of bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends from society, and closely united around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have excellently completed the glorious task of "grasp revolution, promote production." Over the past two years, the factory's production has not been interrupted and has completed and exceeded production tasks month after month. Since May 1967, it has repeatedly created historical high records, and in August this year, it exceeded the highest monthly production before the Cultural Revolution by more than 10%. The technological revolution has flourished, with more than 300 technological innovations implemented.

The fundamental reason for these achievements is that the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work has been fully played.

The revolutionary committee must have a group of outstanding worker representatives to ensure the leading role of the working class organizationally.

This factory is an old factory with a history of more than 60 years, deeply influenced by feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist poison. After liberation, it was one of the main factories in China for passenger car repairs. China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system implemented a policy of surrender and betrayal, placing a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in key positions in the factory. They usurped the power of the party, government, finance, and culture, fully implemented a set of revisionist enterprise management lines of control, suppression, and oppression, and vigorously suppressed the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the working class. They attempted to cancel the leading role of the working class in the enterprise and restore capitalism.

When the revolutionary committee was established, someone said, "The revolutionary committee represents the leadership of the working class, so it doesn't matter much whether workers join or not." The broad revolutionary masses pointed out sharply: The leadership of the working class must be realized through its party and various levels of revolutionary committees. Various levels of revolutionary committees must become revolutionary, representative, authoritative, and closely connected with the masses. They must absorb a certain number of worker masses to participate. The view and practice of not allowing worker representatives to join the revolutionary committee are wrong. Their purpose is to obstruct the working class from participating in the leadership. After unifying their understanding, they selected a large number of outstanding worker representatives to join the leading cadres of various levels of revolutionary committees. Of the 21 members of the factory revolutionary committee, excluding two military representatives, 18 are workers or cadres of worker origin, accounting for more than 90%. All the leading members of the grassroots revolutionary committees are workers or cadres of worker origin. This ensures the leading role of the working class organizationally.

Once the worker representatives joined the revolutionary committee, they played a significant role. They first followed Chairman Mao's great instruction on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," linking it with the actual class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-road struggle in the factory. They exposed and criticized the various harms of the old system, summarizing them as "five excesses" (many organizations, many personnel, many meetings, many documents and reports, many rules and regulations), "five evils" (work delay, red tape, stubbornness, passing the buck, and kicking the ball), and "five poisons" (controlling, suppressing, deducting, fining, and oppressing workers). They realized that streamlining administration and reducing personnel is a major issue related to anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, a major issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, and a major issue of the new revolutionary committee executing which line and following which road. They carried out thorough revolutionary spirit and took decisive revolutionary measures, reducing the number of full-time personnel in the factory from over 800 to over 200, streamlining by 70%. The number of personnel in the factory revolutionary committee was also reduced to 15. Every day, except for four committee members who handle daily work and are on duty, all the others go deep into the workshops to work, study, and criticize and transform themselves together with the masses. This made the new revolutionary committee a revolutionary, closely connected with the masses, and vigorous fighting command center.

Deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and establish the leading role of the working class ideologically.

After the worker representatives joined the revolutionary committee, some people spread various fallacies doubting the leadership of the working class, saying, "Workers have low levels and cannot lead the factory." The revolutionary committee believed that this argument was a manifestation of not believing in the leadership of the working class and that the poison of China's Khrushchev despising the workers and treating the masses as "idiots" had not been cleaned up. Therefore, they mobilized the broad masses of workers to criticize the reactionary fallacy of "capitalists have good points and workers have bad points," and to expose the excellent qualities of the working class and the facts that they can lead everything. Everyone unanimously agreed that the working class has the farthest vision, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The working class is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and understands and applies Chairman Mao's instructions the best. The working class has rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The working class has the highest awareness and knows what exploitation is, what oppression is, what socialism is, what capitalism is, what the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao is, and what the bourgeois reactionary line is. Therefore, the working class has the firmest stance and the clearest banner. What is leadership level? Following the thought of Mao Zedong and unconditionally implementing the orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters is the highest leadership level. With such good leadership, we can follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and make our iron-clad mountains and rivers unchanged.

Countless facts prove that the "old and difficult" problems that those intellectuals cannot solve are easily solved by workers. Once, due to some objective reasons, production was temporarily affected, leaving only seven days to complete half of the monthly production task. Some bourgeois "experts" deliberately sighed and said, "To complete half a month's task in seven days, even if you work day and night without sleep, it's still one day short, and even if you risk your life, you can't complete it!" The workers' attitude towards this problem was completely different. They felt that not completing the production task given by the state was disloyal to Chairman Mao. They said resolutely, "Even if we work day and night without sleep and risk our lives, we must push production up!" Some workers walked tens of miles to go to work, some brought their bedding into the workshop, and many retired old workers also rushed to the factory to participate in production. After seven days of hard struggle, they finally completed the monthly production task on time and with quality. The tool workshop was a "difficult" unit in the factory, and production was always lagging behind. After the worker representatives of the revolutionary committee arrived, they found that the fundamental reason for the production not going up was that the class enemy incited anarchist trends. Then they mobilized the masses, exposed the bad elements, and production surged, completing the production task two days ahead of schedule that month.

The leadership abilities shown by workers in the Cultural Revolution and all work have refuted those bourgeois intellectuals who think "workers have low levels and cannot lead the factory," making them look ridiculous and speechless. At the same time, the broad revolutionary masses have deeply realized that the working class not only must lead everything but also can lead everything; without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious. This further established the leading role of the working class ideologically.

Clean up the poison of "expert management" and let the working class grasp technical power.

After establishing the leading role of the working class organizationally and ideologically, bourgeois intellectuals played their last card, stubbornly resisting and attempting to negate the leadership of the working class. They said, "The working class is proficient in revolution, can still manage production, but leading technology, well, there's still a question mark."

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out wisely, "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Can the working class grasp technical power? Look at the facts:

This factory once faced the problem of passenger car paint drying slowly, affecting the delivery of passenger cars and prolonging the production cycle, becoming a key issue in production. Bourgeois technical "authorities" hid in their rooms, flipped through books, and searched for materials, but were helpless in solving this key production problem. At this time, Master Chen Dekun, relying on his decades of practical experience, successfully developed a paint drying agent, solving this technical difficulty. However, that bourgeois technical "authority" colluded with the capitalist-roader to interfere, saying that this drying agent damaged the composition of the paint and could not be used. Master Chen took a piece of wood, applied paint and drying agent, and placed it outside to be blown by the wind, rained on, and exposed to the sun and moon. The result was that the paint was still good. He took this experimental board to find that bourgeois technical "authority" again, saying, "You have your foreign doctrines, and I have my local methods. If you can refute me, I won't use it." Faced with ironclad facts, that bourgeois technical "authority" had to admit defeat and had to allow this experiment to be widely applied in production. Since the Cultural Revolution, the more than 300 technological innovations implemented in this factory were all completed by the three-in-one technological innovation teams with workers as the main body.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "Establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable rules and regulations, transfer office personnel, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages." Currently, the revolutionary committee of this factory is organizing the broad masses of workers to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, advance victoriously, and better complete the task of struggle, criticism, and transformation given by Chairman Mao. They will fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, and turn the Pukou Vehicle Factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    南京浦镇车辆厂革委会遵循毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的教导
    充分发挥工人阶级在斗批改中的领导作用
    选拔一批优秀的工人代表参加革委会，深入持久地开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫轻视工人阶级和“专家治厂”的流毒，保证工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用
    本报讯　南京浦镇车辆工厂革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大教导，在解放军驻厂支左部队的帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级在斗、批、改中的领导作用，使全厂的斗、批、改不断向纵深发展，并取得了很大成绩。
    这个厂在南京是一个有影响的大厂。自文化大革命以来，广大革命职工坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除来自社会上资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮的干扰，紧密团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，出色地完成了“抓革命，促生产”的光荣任务。两年多来，该厂生产不仅没有中断过，而且月月完成和超额完成生产任务。从一九六七年五月份起，多次创造了历史最高纪录，今年八月份还超过了文化大革命前的最高月产量的百分之十以上。技术革命蓬勃发展，共实现了三百多项技术革新。
    这个厂所以能取得这些成绩，根本的原因是：充分地发挥了工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。
    革委会要有一批优秀的工人代表，从组织上保证工人阶级的领导作用
    这个厂是一个具有六十多年历史的老厂，封、资、修的流毒很深。解放后，它是我国客车修理的主要工厂之一。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统的代理人，推行了一条招降纳叛的组织路线，把一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”安插在工厂的各个重要岗位，篡夺了工厂的党、政、财、文大权，全面推行了一整套管、卡、压的修正主义企业管理路线，竭力压制工人阶级的社会主义积极性和创造性，取消工人阶级在企业中的领导作用，妄图复辟资本主义。
    革命委员会成立时，有人说：“革委会就是代表工人阶级领导的，工人进不进革委会没多大关系。”广大革命群众一针见血地指出：工人阶级的领导是要通过他的政党和各级革委会来实现的，各级革委会要使自己成为一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的、能密切联系群众的权力机构，就必须吸收一定数量的工人群众参加。那种不让工人代表参加革委会的看法和做法是错误的。其目的，就是企图阻挠工人阶级参加领导。认识统一后，他们选拔了大批优秀的工人代表，参加各级革命委员会的领导班子。厂革命委员会除两名军队代表外的二十一个委员中，工人或工人出身的干部就有十八人，占百分之九十以上；各基层革命委员会的领导成员，全部是工人或工人出身的干部。这样就从组织上保证了工人阶级的领导作用。
    工人代表一进入革委会，就充分地发挥了巨大作用。他们首先遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，联系工厂两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，大揭大批旧机构的种种危害。他们把旧机构的罪状归纳为“五多”（机构多、人员多、会议多、文件报表多、规章制度多）、“五害”（工作拖拉、扯皮、顶牛、将军、踢球）、“五毒”（对工人实行管、卡、扣、罚、压）。他们认识到精兵简政是关系到反修防修的大事，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的大事，是新生的革委会执行什么路线走什么道路的大事。他们发扬彻底革命的精神，采取果断的革命措施，一下子把全厂脱产人员从八百多人压缩到二百多人，精简百分之七十。厂革命委员会的办事人员也压缩到十五人。每天厂革委会除四个委员主持日常工作和值班外其余全部深入车间，和群众同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修。从而使新生的革命委员会成为革命化的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    深入持久地开展革命的大批判，从思想上确立工人阶级的领导作用
    工人代表参加了革命委员会以后，有的人散布种种怀疑工人阶级领导的谬论，说什么“工人水平低，领导不了工厂”。革委会认为这种论调是不相信工人阶级领导的表现，是中国赫鲁晓夫轻视工人，把群众当成“阿斗”的流毒还没有肃清。于是，发动广大职工大批“资本家有好就说好，工人不好就说不好”的反动谬论，大摆工人阶级的优秀品质和能够领导一切的事实。大家一致认为，工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的指示学得最好，用得最活。工人阶级有阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的丰富的实践经验。工人阶级觉悟最高，最懂得什么是剥削，什么是压迫；什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义；什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线。因此，工人阶级立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明。什么是领导水平，按照毛泽东思想办事、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令，就是最高的领导水平。有了这样的好领导，就能够沿着毛主席指出的方向，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，使我们铁打的江山永不变色。工人阶级比起那些所谓有
  “水平”、有“能力”的资产阶级知识分子不知要高明多少倍。
    无数事实证明，那些知识分子解决不了的“老大难”问题，工人一到，就迎刃而解。有一个月由于一些客观原因，使生产暂时受到了影响，剩下最后七天，要完成全月生产任务的一半。有些资产阶级“专家”，故意唉声叹气地说：“七天要完成半月任务，就是白天黑夜不睡觉也还差一天，拚上老命也完不成啦！”而工人对待这个问题的态度截然不同，他们感到没完成国家交给的生产任务，就是对毛主席的不忠。他们斩钉截铁地说：“就是白天黑夜不睡觉，拚上老命也得要把生产突上去！”有的工人步行几十里赶来上班，有的带着铺盖进了车间，连许多退休老工人也纷纷赶到厂里，参加生产。经过七天的艰苦奋战，终于保质保量地按时胜利完成了全月生产任务。工具车间是全厂的一个“老大难”单位，生产一直落后。革委会的工人代表一到，就找到了生产上不去的根本原因是阶级敌人煽动无政府主义思潮，接着发动群众，揪出了坏人，生产一跃而上，当月提前两天完成了生产任务。
    工人在文化大革命中和一切工作中所显示出来的领导才干，把那些认为“工人水平低，领导不了工厂”的资产阶级知识分子，驳得狼狈不堪，哑口无言。同时广大革命群众也深刻地认识到，工人阶级不但必须领导一切，而且能够领导一切；没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。从而进一步从思想上确立了工人阶级的领导作用。
    肃清“专家治厂”的流毒，让工人阶级掌握技术大权
    在从组织上、思想上确立了工人阶级的领导作用后，资产阶级知识分子又拿出最后一张“王牌”，负隅顽抗，妄图否定工人阶级领导。他们说：“工人阶级搞革命是内行，抓生产还可以，领导技术嘛，还得画个问号。”
    伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。工人阶级能不能掌握技术大权，请看事实：
    这个工厂一度出现客车油漆干燥很慢，影响客车出厂，延长生产周期，成为生产的关键问题。资产阶级技术“权威”，躲在房子里，翻书本，查资料，对解决这个生产关键问题束手无策。这时陈德金老师傅凭他几十年实践的经验，试制成功了一种油漆干燥剂，解决了这个技术难题。但是，那个资产阶级技术“权威”伙同走资派加以干涉，说：这种干燥剂破坏油漆的成分，不能使用。陈师傅就用一块木板涂上油漆和干燥剂后，放在外边风吹雨打，日晒夜露，结果油漆仍然很好。他拿了这块试验板再去找那个资产阶级技术“权威”，说：你有你的洋教条，我有我的土办法，你能驳倒我，我就不用。在铁的事实面前，那个资产阶级技术“权威”不得不低头认输，只好让这项试验在生产上广泛应用。文化大革命以来，这个厂实现的三百多项技术革新，都是以工人为主体的三结合技术革新小组完成的。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”目前，这个厂革命委员会正组织广大职工在认真学习、深刻领会毛主席最新指示的基础上，乘胜前进，更好地完成毛主席交给的斗、批、改任务，充分地发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，把浦镇车辆工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。　（浦厂报道组）
