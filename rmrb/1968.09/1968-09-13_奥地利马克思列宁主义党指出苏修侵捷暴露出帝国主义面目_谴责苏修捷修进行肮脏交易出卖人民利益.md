The Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party points out that the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia exposes the imperialist nature of the Soviet revisionists and condemns the dirty deals between Soviet and Czechoslovak revisionists that betray the interests of the people.

	The Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party, must resolutely fight to restore national independence and rebuild the workers' government.

	BEIJING, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party recently issued a statement titled "For an Independent Socialist Czechoslovakia," strongly condemning the armed invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet revisionist clique and the dirty deals between the Czechoslovak revisionist clique and the Soviet revisionist clique that betray the interests of the Czechoslovak people.

	The statement said: "The Central Committee of the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party resolutely condemns the armed military intervention by the Moscow revisionists and their followers in Czechoslovakia, and believes that this is not only an act of aggression against a small country's independence but also an imperialist crime against socialist and communist thought worldwide."

	The statement said: The agreement reached between the Dubcek-Svoboda group and the Moscow revisionists and their followers in Moscow from August 23 to 27, 1968, is generally a shameless betrayal of the interests of the people of all countries, especially the interests of the Czechoslovak people. This agreement is a new addition to the series of revisionist crimes, and therefore it cannot be recognized by the truly patriotic forces of Czechoslovakia, nor can it be recognized by the progressive forces of other countries.

	The statement said: "The main points of the agreement signed in Moscow are as follows:

	"First, the Russian and other occupying armies will continue to occupy Czechoslovakia indefinitely and will decide for themselves whether to withdraw, when to withdraw, and under what conditions to withdraw their troops. Unlike the past, this occupation is now with the agreement of the Czechoslovak Party and state leaders, who openly play the role of traitors. After these leaders agree to the timing and manner of a possible withdrawal, which is entirely determined by the occupiers, today's Czechoslovakia can only be seen as a protectorate of a member state of the Warsaw Pact under the control of the Moscow leaders.

	"Second, under the condition that the occupation forces remain to ensure that Czechoslovakia remains a part of the Moscow empire, the Soviet and other countries' revisionist leaders agree to continue the policy of capitalist restoration and counter-revolutionary activities in Czechoslovakia under the deceptive slogan of 'liberalization.' They even explicitly state that they recognize and support the counter-revolutionary policies adopted at the January and May plenums of the Czechoslovak revisionist Communist Party.

	"Just as the Dubcek-Svoboda revisionists have openly exposed themselves as traitors, the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionists are now openly playing the role of protectors of Czechoslovakia's further degeneration into capitalism.

	"Therefore, the agreement signed in Moscow not only clearly shatters the illusion that Dubcek, Svoboda, and their accomplices are patriots but also shatters another illusion that the military intervention in Czechoslovakia has something to do with 'opposing the counter-revolution' and 'defending the achievements of socialism.'

	"The reason why the armies, tanks of the Soviet Union and other revisionists entering Czechoslovakia do not constitute a measure to 'protect socialism' is that in fact, neither in the Soviet Union nor in Czechoslovakia today exists an institution worthy of the name 'socialism'! After Stalin's death, the Soviet revisionist leaders betrayed socialism in the fifteen years, abolished the workers' government, and established a revisionist bureaucratic regime that is completely alien to the people, which is nothing more than a cursed variant of the capitalist system."

	The statement said: "After the two traitorous cliques reached a political deal in Moscow, the urgent task facing the Czechoslovak people is a broad national resistance to the foreign ruling organization. It is now clearer than ever that such a national mass resistance cannot be realized under the leadership of counter-revolutionaries like Dubcek, Svoboda, Smrkovsky, and others, who have just handed over Czechoslovakia to the occupying country and given the presence of foreign troops a legal appearance.

	"Only through the resolute struggle of the broad masses of the people organized and led by a Marxist-Leninist Party that is consistently based on the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, can Czechoslovakia restore the national independence taken away by the Moscow revisionists and rebuild the workers' government that was betrayed by Novotny, Svoboda, and Dubcek in this country.

	"The Austrian Marxist-Leninists will do their utmost to stand on the side of the Czechoslovak Marxist-Leninists and all the patriotic people of Czechoslovakia who are completing this great task."

    奥地利马克思列宁主义党指出苏修侵捷暴露出帝国主义面目
    谴责苏修捷修进行肮脏交易出卖人民利益
    捷人民在马列主义党领导下坚决斗争才能恢复民族独立重建工人政权
    新华社十二日讯　奥地利马克思列宁主义党中央委员会最近发表题为《争取独立的社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克》的声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的罪行，谴责捷修叛徒集团同苏修叛徒集团进行肮脏交易，出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民利益。
    声明说：“奥地利马克思列宁主义党中央委员会坚决谴责莫斯科修正主义者及其追随者对捷克斯洛伐克的武装军事干涉，并认为这不仅是反对一个小国的独立，而且是反对全世界社会主义和共产主义思想的一个帝国主义大国的罪行。”
    声明说：一九六八年八月二十三日至二十七日，杜布切克—斯沃博达集团同莫斯科修正主义者及其追随者在莫斯科达成的协定，总的来说是对各国人民利益的无耻出卖，特别是对捷克斯洛伐克人民利益的无耻出卖。这一协定是对修正主义的一连串罪行的新的补充，因此它既不能被捷克斯洛伐克真正爱国的力量所承认，也不能被其它国家的进步力量所承认。
    声明说：“在莫斯科签订的这一协定其主要之点有二：
    “一、俄国和别国占领军将无限期地继续占领捷克斯洛伐克，并自己决定，今后是否撤退、何时撤退和在什么情况下撤退他们的部队。与过去不同的是，这一占领现在是取得捷克斯洛伐克党和国家领导人的同意的，这些人公开扮演着叛国者的角色。在这些领导人同意可能撤军的时间和方式完全由占领者自定以后，今天的捷克斯洛伐克只能被看作是在莫斯科领导人控制下的华沙条约国的一部分国家的保护国而已。
    “二、在由于占领军留驻从而保证捷克斯洛伐克仍然是莫斯科王朝的一个组成部分的条件下，苏联和其它国家修正主义领导人赞同在捷克斯洛伐克继续执行资本主义复辟的政策和在‘自由化’这一欺骗性口号下进行的反革命活动，他们甚至明确声称，他们对捷克斯洛伐克修正主义共产党一月和五月全会上制定的反革命政策表示承认和支持。
    “正象杜布切克—斯沃博达修正主义者公开暴露为叛国者一样，勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义者现在公开扮演着使捷克斯洛伐克进一步向资本主义蜕化的保护者。
    “因此，在莫斯科签订的协定既清楚地粉碎了杜布切克、斯沃博达及其同伙是爱国者的幻想，也粉碎了另一种相反的幻想，即在捷克斯洛伐克的军事干涉同‘反对反革命’和‘保卫社会主义成果’有某种关系。
    “苏联和其他修正主义者的军队、装甲车进驻捷克斯洛伐克之所以不成其为
  ‘保护社会主义’的措施，就是因为今天事实上不管是在苏联还是在捷克斯洛伐克都不存在与‘社会主义’称号相称的制度！苏联修正主义领导人在斯大林逝世后的十五年中背叛了社会主义，取消了工人政权，建立了一个与人民格格不入的修正主义的官僚政权，它不过是一个受人诅咒的资本主义制度的变种而已。”
    声明说：“两个叛徒集团在莫斯科达成政治交易之后，捷克斯洛伐克人民所面临的紧急任务是对外来的统治组织广泛的民族的反抗。现在比以往任何时候都更加清楚，这样一个民族的群众性反抗绝不能在杜布切克、斯沃博达、斯姆尔科夫斯基等那样的反革命分子领导下实现，他们刚刚将捷克斯洛伐克拱手交给占领国并给予外国军队的驻留以合法的假象。
    “只有通过建立在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东学说基础上的始终不渝的马克思列宁主义党所组织和领导的广大人民群众的坚决斗争，才能使捷克斯洛伐克恢复莫斯科修正主义者所夺去的民族独立，重建被诺沃提尼、斯沃博达和杜布切克所背叛的这个国家的工人政权。
    “奥地利马克思列宁主义者将竭尽全力站在正在完成这一伟大任务的捷克斯洛伐克马克思列宁主义者和捷克斯洛伐克全体爱国人民一边。”
