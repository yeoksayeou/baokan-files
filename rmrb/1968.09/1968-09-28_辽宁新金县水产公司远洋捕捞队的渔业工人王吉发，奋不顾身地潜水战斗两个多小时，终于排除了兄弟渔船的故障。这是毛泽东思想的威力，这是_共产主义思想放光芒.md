The fishermen of the Liaoning Newjin County Fishery Company's distant sea fishing team, Wang Jifa, bravely dove into the water and fought for more than two hours, finally eliminating the malfunction of a brother fishing boat. This is the power of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the radiance of communist ideology.

The fishermen along the Yellow Sea coast of the Liaodong Peninsula are enthusiastically reciting the heroic deeds of Wang Jifa, who bravely dove into the sea to eliminate the malfunction of a brother fishing boat.

This year, during the fishing season, the fishing boats of the Newjin County Fishery Company's distant sea fishing team sailed to the sea near Wangjia Island to catch yellow croaker.

Wang Jifa was working intensely on the boat when he suddenly saw that the distant No. 51 boat had a malfunction, unable to move forward or backward. Based on his years of experience, he determined that the boat's screw was entangled. According to the usual procedure, this situation could only be resolved by towing the boat back to the port, cutting off the net entangled on the screw, and then sinking it back into the sea. Wang Jifa thought: Now is the peak season, and the fish are so abundant. We absolutely cannot stand by and watch a brother boat have an accident without helping, which would affect the entire production plan. However, if he abandoned his current work to help the brother boat, he would miss this great opportunity to complete the production task. What should he do? Two thoughts were fiercely battling in his mind. He thought: One person's success is a small success, but everyone's success is a great success! This yellow croaker is a material for aiding Vietnam and resisting America. If we catch more fish, it will be a powerful support for them! It will be a contribution to the world revolution! Thus, he voluntarily contacted No. 51 boat and gradually approached them.

The Yellow Sea surface has waves three feet high without wind, and even higher waves with wind. Wang Jifa forgot about the man-eating sharks in the water, forgot about the razor-sharp barnacles on the ship's bottom that would leave a bloody gash if touched, and he shouted Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," while holding a large knife and bravely jumping into the water.

A underwater battle began. The nylon net wrapped around the ship's screw was as thick as a person's arm, and the nylon line was soft and slippery in the water, slipping off the knife with each cut. Each time he dived, he could only cut two or three times. He struggled down, then struggled up, and then dived again. The rolling waves battered him, and the icy sea water made his teeth chatter, but Wang Jifa had only one thought in his mind: "In this season of great fishing harvest, time is life. Chairman Mao urges us to seize the revolution and promote production. If we delay even one second, it would be disloyal to Chairman Mao!" To increase his underwater working efficiency, he simply took the method of drinking water into his stomach to extend his diving time. One gulp, two gulps... the bitter and salty sea water filled his stomach; time passed, one minute, two minutes... he dived more than twenty times, continuously fighting for more than two hours, finally cutting off the net wrapped around the ship's screw.

At this moment, Wang Jifa was already exhausted, and his stomach was full of sea water. He felt his vision go black and sank into the water. Just at this moment, the great teachings of Chairman Mao, "No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight," flashed in his mind, and a powerful force pushed him. Wang Jifa summoned the fierce spirit of his days as a soldier fighting the enemy, leaping out of the water, and the workers on the boat immediately pulled him onto the small boat.

Wang Jifa lay unconscious on the small boat. Sea water poured out of his mouth and nose, and his body, cut in many places, bled non-stop, but he did not utter a single word of pain. His fearless spirit moved the workers present to tears. Everyone spontaneously gathered around Wang Jifa, unanimously praising him, "He is truly a good worker of Chairman Mao!"

    辽宁新金县水产公司远洋捕捞队的渔业工人王吉发，奋不顾身地潜水战斗两个多小时，终于排除了兄弟渔船的故障。这是毛泽东思想的威力，这是——
    共产主义思想放光芒
    辽东半岛黄海岸边的渔业工人们，热情地传诵着王吉发奋不顾身深入海底，为兄弟渔船排除故障的英雄事迹。
    今年渔汛季节，新金县水产公司远洋捕捞队的渔船开到了王家岛海面捕捞黄花鱼。
    王吉发正在船上紧张地作业时，一抬头看到远处的五十一号船发生了故障，前进不能，后退不得。凭自己多年的经验，他断定那只船是缠摆了。按照常规，这种情况只能用船把它拖回港口去，把缠在摆上的网衣割去再沉下海。王吉发心想：现在正是旺季，鱼情这么好，绝不能眼瞅着兄弟船出了事故不管，影响整个生产计划。可是如果丢下手中的作业去帮助那只兄弟渔船，自己又会失去眼前这个完成生产任务的大好机会。怎么办呢？两种思想激烈斗争着。他想：一人红，红一点，大家红，红一片。这黄花鱼是援越抗美用的物资，咱多打一条鱼就是对他们的有力支援！就是为世界革命贡献一份力量！于是他主动和五十一号船取得联系，把船逐渐向他们靠拢。
    黄海海面上无风三尺浪，有风浪更高。王吉发忘掉了水中有吃人的大鲨鱼，忘掉了船底下长满了象刮脸刀一样快，碰上去就是一道血口子的蜊子头，他一边高声背诵着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，一边手持大刀，奋不顾身地跳下水去。
    一场水下战斗开始了。尼龙网衣把船摆缠得足有一搂多粗，尼龙网线在水中又软又滑，刀割上去又滑下来。他每潜一次水，只能割两三刀。他挣扎着下去，又挣扎着上来，然后再下去。翻卷的浪头撕打着他，冰冷的海水把他冻得牙齿格格作响，然而王吉发脑中只有一个念头：“在这渔业大丰收的季节里，时间就是生命，毛主席号召我们抓革命，促生产，如果多拖延一秒钟，就是对毛主席不忠！”为了提高水下作业效率，他索性采取往肚里喝水的办法，来延长潜水时间。一口，两口……又苦又咸的海水灌进了他的肚子里；时间一分、两分不停地过去，他潜水二十多次，连续战斗两个多小时，终于把船摆上缠的网衣割掉了。
    这时，王吉发同志已经精疲力尽，肚子里又灌满了海水，他只觉得眼前一黑，便一头沉下水去。就在这一刹那间，伟大领袖毛主席的“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的伟大教导，在他脑子里闪现，一股强大的力量推动着他。王吉发拿出了当年参军杀敌的猛劲，一头跃出水面，船上工人立即把他拽上舢板。
    王吉发昏迷地躺在舢板上。海水从嘴里和鼻孔里一个劲往外淌，身上被划破的地方不停地流血，但他没说一个“痛”字。他这种大无畏的精神感动得在场的工人们无不热泪盈眶。大家不约而同地来到王吉发身边，异口同声地称赞他“真是毛主席的好工人！”　鑫向东
