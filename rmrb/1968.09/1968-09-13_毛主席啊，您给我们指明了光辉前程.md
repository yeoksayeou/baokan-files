The red sun rises before us, its brilliant rays illuminating the earth. A red army, composed of red books and red banners, marches through the campus of Beijing Industrial University. People enthusiastically shout: Celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive! Resolutely take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers! Dear Chairman Mao, your latest directive speaks the hearts of revolutionary students and teachers, expressing their demands and aspirations. It is you who best understand their feelings, and it is you who care most for their growth. Revolutionary students and teachers are determined not to disappoint your expectations. They are determined to remember your latest directive, to always accept the education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to always walk the path of integrating with them.

The long-awaited wish has come true

On the night of September 11, mechanical engineering teacher Yu Keqiang participated in a parade celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Upon returning home, he was overwhelmed with thoughts and could not sleep.

In 1956, after graduating from university, Yu Keqiang stepped onto the educational front with full confidence. He was determined to devote all his strength to cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. However, due to his acceptance of bourgeois education, he emphasized professional skills over politics in his teaching, which had negative effects. He was criticized. In 1961, he was transferred to Beijing Industrial University. He thought that changing places would change his mindset. But it was not so. After a year, people sounded the alarm for him again: You are still on the path of being "red but not expert"! Why is this? Yu Keqiang's thoughts were still tangled. The torrent of the Cultural Revolution washed away much of his old thinking. But the problem was not completely solved, and he was still confused and wandering, still wanting to change places again.

Today, Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a bright lamp, illuminating his path forward. His thoughts suddenly became clear. He said: "My past thoughts were wrong. I thought that changing places would improve my mental state. But if the mind does not change, changing places will not help. How to change the mind? The only correct path is to follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When lost, I think of you for direction; when facing difficulties, I think of you for strength. Under the inspiration of your thoughts, Yu Keqiang actively proposed his requirements and wishes to the workers' propaganda team: Resolutely break with the old educational system, go to the workers and peasants, and serve them for life!

"Now, I have a direction!"

It is deep into the night, and the lights in the student dormitories are still on. The cheers celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive pierce the quiet night sky. The campus is immersed in the joyful and excited atmosphere of the festival.

"Dear Chairman Mao! You have shown us the bright future. You have spoken the words in our hearts. We will sincerely accept reform under the leadership of the working class and walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers." Class 6431 student Zong Changjie reflects on his past.

He was born into a family of poor peasants who had never been to school. He was one of the two university students in the village. After being admitted to university, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village were overjoyed, hoping he would become a good successor to the poor peasants. However, under the rule of the revisionist educational line, he had many personal plans, such as becoming an "expert" or an "engineer." His class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants gradually faded away.

The thunderous Cultural Revolution awakened this son of a poor peasant. He threw himself into this great revolution. However, later, he was influenced by bourgeois factionalism and deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a time. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the school, he began to feel that intellectuals were "worthless." He thought that going to university was a "directional and line error." He wanted to take off the "intellectual" hat and go to work!

Chairman Mao's latest directive illuminated Zong Changjie's path forward. He could no longer contain his excitement and said at a meeting: "Now, I see my bright future. With Chairman Mao's revolutionary line leading, as long as I make up my mind and go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to temper and forge myself, to accept their re-education, and to thoroughly reform myself, they will welcome me. Now, I have a direction!"

Maintain the character of the working class forever

Chairman Mao's latest directive spreads with the radio waves, and the hearts of Class 6416 workers are extremely joyful. They love Chairman Mao's latest directive so much! Some take out notebooks to record it, some write it on their hands, and others silently memorize it, deeply engraving it in their hearts.

Among the workers' classmates, Wang Peihua is particularly joyful. Chairman Mao's latest directive has given him immense strength. He was originally a worker at the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory. In 1964, he became a university student. When he left the factory, the master workers repeatedly advised him: "Study hard and maintain the character of the working class."

However, in the school dominated by bourgeois intellectuals, the workers' classmates were suppressed and could not hold their heads high. Those bourgeois masters said: "We only guarantee your professional skills, not your politics." They increased the workload and did not allow them to study Chairman Mao's works. Thus, Wang Peihua had to focus on his professional skills. As a result, he gradually detached himself from politics, from reality, and from workers and peasants, and his health deteriorated. Those bourgeois masters also scolded the workers' class as the "stupid class."

Looking back on the path he has taken, Wang Peihua deeply feels that under the rule of the revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, the educational power was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals, and we workers had no say. Today, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, we workers have taken control of the educational power. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's directives, we will definitely maintain the character of the working class and become true working-class intellectuals.

Chairman Mao's latest directive, like a strong spring breeze, blows through every corner of the Beijing Industrial University campus. Revolutionary students and teachers gather under the red flag of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, launching a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation!

### 毛主席啊，您给我们指明了光辉前程

    毛主席啊，您给我们指明了光辉前程
    红日在我们面前升起，灿烂的光芒照红了大地。红彤彤的宝书、红艳艳的旗帜组成的红色队伍，在北京工业大学的校园里行进。人们尽情高呼：热烈庆祝毛主席最新指示发表，坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路！敬爱的毛主席啊，您的最新指示，字字说出了革命师生的心里话，句句表达了革命师生的要求和愿望。是您，最了解他们的心情，是您，最关怀他们的成长。革命师生决心不辜负您的期望，决心把您的最新指示记在心里，永远接受工农兵的教育，永远走同工农兵相结合的道路。
      多年的愿望实现了
    九月十一日，深夜，机械系教师于克强，参加了游行庆祝活动，回到家里，思潮滚滚，难于入睡。
    一九五六年，于克强在大学毕业后，满怀信心地走上了教育岗位。他决心为培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，献出自己所有的力量。但是，由于他接受了资产阶级的教育，在教学上重业务、轻政治，造成了不好的影响，他受到了批判。一九六一年，他被调到了北工大。他以为这下换个地方，思想也就可以变了。可是不然，过了一年，人们又给他敲了警钟：你走的仍然是只专不红的道路！这是为什么呢？于克强的思想一直解不开。无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，把他的旧思想冲刷了不少。可是，问题并没有完全解决，他仍然苦闷、彷徨，还想再换个地方。
    今天，毛主席的最新指示，就象一盏明灯，照亮了他前进的道路，他思想豁然开朗。他说：“我过去的想法错了。我想换个地方，精神状态就会好。可是，思想不换，地方换到哪里也是一样。怎样换思想？唯一正确的道路，就是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的领导下，由工农兵给我们再教育！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！迷路时想您有方向，困难时想您有力量。于克强在您的思想的鼓舞下，主动地向工人宣传队提出了自己的要求和愿望：坚决和旧教育制度决裂，到工农中去，一辈子为工农兵服务！
      “现在，我有奔头了！”
    夜深了，学生宿舍里的灯火通明。庆祝毛主席最新指示发表的欢呼声，划破了宁静的夜空。校园沉浸在欢乐、激动的节日气氛中。
      “敬爱的毛主席啊！您给我们指明了光辉的前程，您说出了我们革命青年的心里话，我们一定老老实实地在工人阶级的领导下，接受改造，走同工农兵相结合的道路。”六四三一班宗长杰同学，前思后想，往事浮现在他的眼前。
    他出生在祖祖辈辈没有上过学的贫农家庭，是村上仅有的两个大学生中的一个。他考上大学后，村上的贫下中农怀着喜悦的心情，希望他做贫下中农的好后代。可是，在修正主义教育路线的统治下，什么“专家”啦！“工程师”啦！他的个人打算多了。贫下中农的阶级感情，在他的心中逐渐淡薄下去。
    无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚春雷，唤醒了这个贫农的儿子。他投入了这场轰轰烈烈的大革命。可是，后来，他受到资产阶级派性的影响，一度背离了毛主席革命路线的轨道。工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校后，他开始觉得知识分子“一钱不值”，当初上大学，就犯了“方向、路线性错误”。他想把知识分子“帽子”摘掉，去劳动算了！
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，照亮了宗长杰前进的方向。他再也按捺不住自己激动的心情，在座谈会上说：“我现在看到了自己的广阔前途。有毛主席革命路线的领导，只要我自己下决心、下狠心到工农兵中去磨炼，去锤炼，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造自己，工农兵是会欢迎我的。现在，我有奔头了！”
      永葆工人阶级的本色
    毛主席的最新指示随着电波飞扬，六四一六工人班同学，心头无比欢畅。他们多么热爱毛主席的最新指示啊！有的掏出本子记下，有的记在手心里，还有的默默背诵，深深地记在心坎里。
    工人班同学中间，王培华更是喜气洋洋，毛主席的最新指示给了他无比力量。他原是北京第一机床厂的工人。一九六四年他当了大学生。离开厂的时候，老师傅语重心长，再三叮咛：“要好好学习，保持工人阶级的本色。”
    可是，在资产阶级知识分子统治下的学校里，工人班的同学被压抑得抬不起头来，那些资产阶级的老爷们说：
  “只保你们业务，不保你们政治。”加重功课，不让他们学习毛主席著作。于是，王培华不得不埋头业务。结果，他慢慢脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离工农，身体也搞垮了。那些资产阶级老爷们，还骂工人班是“笨蛋班”。
    回顾走过的道路，王培华深深感到，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的统治下，教育大权落在资产阶级知识分子手里，我们工人根本不能过问。今天，在毛主席正确路线领导之下，我们工人掌握了教育大权，只要我们按毛主席的指示办事，我们一定能永葆工人阶级的本色，成为真正的工人阶级知识分子。
    毛主席的最新指示，就象一股强劲的春风，吹遍了北工大校园的每一个角落。革命师生一齐到毛主席革命路线的红旗下集合，掀起斗、批、改新高潮！　本报记者
