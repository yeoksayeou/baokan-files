Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary members of production teams across the country have fought vigorously for a year, achieving brilliant new victories. They have made new contributions to the socialist cause of the motherland and created new meritorious deeds. News from various places in the south and north indicates that, under the great situation of the continuous victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this year's agricultural production in our country is once again a bumper harvest.

The "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." This year, in the north, many places experienced continuous drought in the spring and summer, and some places did not receive sufficient rain until late July and early August, making the drought the most severe in many years; in the south, many places experienced spring drought and summer floods, and some places even encountered rare historical floods. All these natural disasters have, to varying degrees, caused difficulties for agricultural production. However, under the encouragement and inspiration of the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories and is striding forward to achieve comprehensive victory, the hundreds of millions of peasants are spirited, full of fighting spirit, and full of vigor. They have fully carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "making up one's mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." While launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, they have tenaciously fought against various natural disasters, finally overcoming one difficulty after another and welcoming the bumper harvest of agricultural production.

A notable feature of this year's agricultural production in our country is that almost all types of crops and different regions have presented a prosperous scene of bumper harvests. The summer and early autumn crops in various places have already been harvested, with many places achieving different degrees of increased production compared to last year's bumper harvest. The autumn crops, which have a significant impact on the annual yield, are currently being harvested on a large scale. The vast rural areas are filled with the magnificent scene of "watching the waves of rice and millet, and heroes descending in the evening smoke." The bumper harvest is assured. The few late autumn crops that have not yet matured are growing vigorously. As long as no special disasters occur in the coming period, a good harvest can also be expected. Relevant leading departments estimate that this year, crops and agricultural products such as grain, cotton, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, tea, fruits, and silk cocoons will achieve another bumper harvest on the basis of consecutive bumper harvests. The production of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is also in a thriving and prosperous situation. From a regional perspective, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, including major agricultural areas in the south and north such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi, are generally bumper harvest years. Beijing, which suffered a severe drought unprecedented in seventy years, and Shanghai, the birthplace of the "January Revolution," are expected to achieve a bumper harvest of grain crops and economic crops such as cotton, which is rare in history. Some regions where agricultural production has been slow for many years have also seen a new situation of significant increased production this year.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. This year's bumper harvest in our country's agriculture is a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Since last winter, to achieve this year's bumper harvest, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, vigorously grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. They have launched a widespread and in-depth "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" mass movement, creating conditions for a bumper harvest from all aspects. The broad masses of peasants, taking Dazhai as an example, closely followed the battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and eagerly studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, various rural areas have carried out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement, exposing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places who attempted to restore capitalism in the countryside, and striking down the sabotage activities of a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The vigorous revolutionary criticism has further raised the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, and their determination to follow the socialist road has become even firmer. They have expressed: "To thoroughly eliminate the evil of capitalism and accelerate the construction of a beautiful socialism, we dare to climb the knife mountain and leap into the fire sea." It is with this fearless revolutionary spirit cultivated by Mao Zedong Thought that, over the past year, the masses of peasants in various places have overcome various difficulties, actively and proactively carried out agricultural infrastructure construction, reformed agricultural production technology according to local conditions, and strengthened field management in a timely manner. When natural disasters such as droughts and floods struck, they boldly put forward the battle slogan of "fighting disasters until the heavens yield, and resolutely seizing a bumper harvest in agriculture," and bravely fought against natural disasters, finally achieving the bumper harvest of agricultural production.

This year's good harvest in our country's agriculture is achieved on the basis of consecutive bumper harvests over the years. The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further strengthened the socialist position in our rural areas. With the continuous strengthening of the collective economy of people's communes, agricultural infrastructure construction and agricultural mechanization in various places have further developed, and the ability to resist natural disasters has greatly increased. These are also very important factors for achieving the bumper harvest of agricultural production this year under the condition of relatively severe natural disasters.

The bumper harvest of our country's agriculture this year is inseparable from the strong leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels and the strong support of the People's Liberation Army. Over the past year, the leading cadres of revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, gone deep into the countryside, eating, living, working, studying, and fighting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, making the revolution vigorous, promoting production with the revolution, and making the vast rural areas present a lively scene. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, reviewing the past year's battle course, deeply felt: "The revolutionary committee is good!" "The People's Liberation Army is good!"

Chairman Mao teaches: "Every year, we must grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and using (harvesting, storing, and using) very tightly." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, are currently following Chairman Mao's instructions, actively carrying out autumn harvesting while strengthening storage and distribution work, striving to achieve meticulous harvesting, careful storage, frugal use, and thrift, better supporting national construction. They are also following Chairman Mao's instructions of "human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." They are deeply summarizing the experience of vigorously grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production over the past year, arranging work for this winter and next spring, and preparing for an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, and create new merits for the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利
    全国农业生产又是大好丰收年景
    新华社二十七日讯　我国亿万贫下中农和广大革命社员在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，斗志昂扬地“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，经过一年来的艰苦奋战，又取得了光辉灿烂的新成就，为祖国的社会主义事业作出了新贡献，建立了新功勋。来自南北各地的消息表明，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，今年我国的农业生产又是一个丰收的大好年景。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”今年，在北方，不少地区春、夏两季持续干旱，有的地区直到七月底、八月初仍未降透雨，旱情之严重为多年来所少见；在南方，不少地区春旱、夏涝，有的地方并出现历史上少有的特大洪水。所有这些自然灾害，都在不同程度上给农业生产造成困难。但是，在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利，正向夺取全面胜利的伟大目标大踏步迈进的大好形势的激励和鼓舞下，亿万农民群众精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。他们高度发扬“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，一面主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，一面顽强地同各种自然灾害展开英勇的搏斗，终于排除了一个又一个的困难，迎来了农业生产的丰收。
    今年我国农业生产的显著特色是：几乎各类农作物和各类不同地区，都呈现出一派欣欣向荣的丰收景象。各地的夏熟作物和早秋作物，已先后喜获丰收，不少地区比大丰收的去年又有不同程度的增产。对全年产量有重大影响的大秋作物，现正大规模地进行收割，广大农村到处是“喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟”的壮丽图景，丰收大局已定。尚未成熟的少量晚秋作物，普遍生长壮旺，只要今后一个时期不发生特殊灾害，也可望获得好收成。有关领导部门估计，今年全国粮食、棉花、烤烟、麻类、茶叶、水果、蚕茧等农作物和农产品，都将在连年丰收的基础上又一次获得丰收。林、牧、副、渔各业生产，也是一派蒸蒸日上的大好形势。从地区看，全国各省、市、自治区，包括南方和北方的主要农业区四川、广东、湖南、湖北、江苏、江西、安徽、河南、黑龙江、陕西等省在内，今年一般都是丰收年景。遭到七十多年所仅见的特大干旱的首都北京和“一月革命”策源地的上海，今年粮食作物和棉花等经济作物，可望获得历史上罕见的大丰收。一些多年来农业生产发展缓慢的地区，今年也出现了大幅度增产的新局面。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。今年我国农业生产又获丰收，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。从去冬起，为夺取今年农业丰收，各地亿万贫下中农和农村革命干部，就遵照毛主席的伟大教导，意气风发地狠抓革命，猛促生产，空前广泛深入地开展了“农业学大寨”的群众运动，从各个方面为农业丰收创造条件。广大农民群众以大寨为榜样，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，如饥似渴地活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉地用毛泽东思想武装头脑。在毛泽东思想的指引下，各地农村开展了持久、深入的革命大批判运动，清算了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，打击了一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动。轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，进一步提高了广大农民群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，走社会主义道路的决心更加坚定。他们纷纷表示：“为了彻底消灭万恶的资本主义，加速建设美好的社会主义，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。”正是靠着这种用毛泽东思想培育起来的大无畏的革命精神，一年来，各地农民群众排除了各种困难，主动积极地进行农田基本建设，因地制宜地改革农业生产技术，及时地加强田间管理。当旱、涝等自然灾害袭来时，他们豪迈地提出“抗灾抗到天低头，誓夺农业大丰收”的战斗口号，英勇地向自然灾害作斗争，终于夺得了农业生产的丰收。
    今年我国农业的好收成，是在多年来连续丰收的基础上取得的。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，使我国农村社会主义阵地进一步得到加强。随着人民公社集体经济的日益强大，各地农田基本建设和农业机械化事业进一步发展，抗御自然灾害的能力大大增强。这些，也是今年在自然灾害比较严重的条件下，仍能夺得农业生产丰收的十分重要的因素。
    我国今年农业生产的丰收，是和各级革命委员会的坚强领导和人民解放军的大力支援分不开的。一年来，各级革命委员会的领导干部和人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的广大指战员，遵照毛主席的教导，深入农村，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗争，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，以革命促生产，使广大农村呈现出一派热气腾腾的局面。广大贫下中农在回顾一年来的战斗历程时，深有感受地说：“革命委员会就是好！”“人民解放军就是好！”
    毛主席教导说：“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧。”无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的广大贫下中农，正遵照毛主席的指示，在积极进行秋收的同时，大力加强保管和分配等工作，尽力做到精收、细管、省吃、俭用，更好地支援国家建设。他们还遵照毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的指示，深入总结一年来狠抓革命、猛促生产的经验，安排今冬、明春的工作，为夺取明年农业生产的更大丰收作准备。他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设再立新功。
