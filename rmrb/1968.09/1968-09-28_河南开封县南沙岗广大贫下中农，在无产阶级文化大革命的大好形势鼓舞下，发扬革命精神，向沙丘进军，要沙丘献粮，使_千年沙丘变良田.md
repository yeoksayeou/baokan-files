The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nansha Gang, Kaifeng County, Henan, inspired by the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carry forward the revolutionary spirit, march forward to the sand dunes, demand that the sand dunes yield grain, and turn the thousand-year-old sand dunes into fertile fields.

	“Nansha Gang” is a twenty-li long stretch of sand dunes in Kaifeng County, Henan. In winter, the wild winds blow sand everywhere, turning the sky yellow; in summer, the sand dunes are scorching hot like a fire, with no grass or crops growing. People call it the “burning earth” and “barren land.” A few years ago, the poor and lower-middle peasants here attempted to change the sand dunes, but due to the black goods of “three freedoms and one contract” pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, the collective economy was destroyed. As the years passed, the sand dunes were never conquered. Thus, Nansha Gang became an unconquerable place in people's minds.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, inspired by the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminate the poison of “three freedoms and one contract.” They “grasp revolution and promote production,” march forward to the sand dunes, and demand that the sand dunes yield grain.

In the winter of the north, with snow and wind, the cold is biting. The entire village, men and women, old and young, braved the wind and snow, held high red flags, sang the song “Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory,” dug wells and canals, built water conservancy projects, planted trees and created forests, blocked the sandstorms, and turned “Nansha Gang” upside down. An old man, sixty years old, who once said, “Locking down ‘Nansha Gang,’ unless the sun rises in the west,” through studying Chairman Mao’s works, dispelled superstitions, and established in his mind the glorious images of Zhang Zide and the “Old Fool Moving Mountains.” His revolutionary enthusiasm soared. He said, “A few years ago, ‘Nansha Gang’ could not be turned over, not blaming the heavens, not blaming the earth, only blaming the ‘three freedoms and one contract’ of the Chinese Khrushchev for confusing our minds.” He vowed to use practical actions to counterattack the Chinese Khrushchev. In the days when the snow blocked the doors, Old Man Zhu and the young men personally participated in digging wells and canals. He participated in digging more than twenty wells, opening fifteen canals, and creating thirty kilometers of protective forests. Through hard work, the barren land turned into a green, fertile land that is guaranteed against droughts and floods. For the first time in history, peanuts, sorghum, and sweet potatoes were planted on this land. This year, despite three consecutive months without rain, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, fighting against nature, fighting against the land, and fighting against class enemies. They still achieved a bumper harvest, changing the backward situation where this place could not be self-sufficient in grain. Now, the commune members are following the great leader Chairman Mao’s teaching of “preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people.” Besides ensuring sufficient food for each household and reserves, they also handed over more than seven thousand jin of surplus grain to the state. The poor and lower-middle peasants all call this “political grain” and “revolutionary victory grain,” shouting “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!”

    河南开封县南沙岗广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势鼓舞下，发扬革命精神，向沙丘进军，要沙丘献粮，使——
    千年沙丘变良田
    “南沙岗”是河南开封县一片二十里长的大沙丘。冬天，狂风卷沙满天黄；夏天，沙丘滚烫如火烧，根本不长草，不长庄稼。人们称它是“火烧地”、“不毛之地”。几年前，这里的贫下中农曾进行过改变沙丘的尝试，但由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”的黑货，破坏了集体经济，时间一年年过去，一直没有征服过这片沙丘。这样，南沙岗在人们心目中成了不可征服的地方。
    广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势鼓舞下，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，高举革命批判大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫展开了猛烈的进攻，肃清“三自一包”的流毒，“抓革命，促生产”，向沙丘进军，要沙丘献粮。
    北方的冬天，风雪交加，寒气逼人。全村男女老少顶风冒雪，高举红旗，高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，打井开渠，兴修水利，植树造林，封锁风沙，硬是把“南沙岗”翻了过来。曾经说过“锁住‘南沙岗’，除非西边出太阳”的六十岁老人朱大爷，通过学习毛主席著作，破除迷信思想，头脑里树立了张思德、“老愚公”的光辉形象，革命干劲冲天。他说：“前几年‘南沙岗’翻不过身，不怨天，不怪地，只怪中国赫鲁晓夫的‘三自一包’把我们心窍迷。”他表示一定要以实际行动来回击中国赫鲁晓夫。在大雪封门的日子里，朱大爷和年青小伙子亲自参加打井挖渠。他参加打井二十多眼，开渠十五条，造防护林三十公里。经过艰苦努力，“不毛之地”变成了旱涝保收的绿色沃洲，开天辟地第一回在这块土地上种了花生、高粱和红薯。今年，在连续三个月滴雨未下的情况下，广大贫下中农狠抓革命，猛促生产，与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，仍然获得了大丰收，改变了这个地方粮食不能自给的落后面貌。现在，社员们正按照伟大领袖毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，除家家户户留足口粮和储备粮外，还给国家交售了七千多斤余粮。贫下中农都称这是“政治粮”、“革命胜利粮”，高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”　　　　　　　　　　　　张江
