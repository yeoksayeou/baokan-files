I am filled with immense excitement as I study the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao: "Students from old-style schools, the majority or a large majority, can combine with workers and peasants. Some of them have made inventions and innovations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line and receive re-education from workers and peasants to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers and peasants." Reflecting on the past year of trials and tribulations in developing a new set of mining sintering equipment with a capacity of over a thousand tons, and the re-education I received from workers and peasants during this process, I feel that Chairman Mao's latest directive is incredibly wise and correct!

Since graduating from school and entering the workforce, several years have passed. In the past, due to the deep influence of my old education and my lack of understanding of the revisionist scientific and technological line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, I did not learn from the workers or regard them as my teachers. Therefore, I always overestimated myself and underestimated the workers, creating a significant gap in my thinking between myself and the workers.

In May 1967, our factory was tasked by the state to produce a set of sintering equipment for a certain factory. When we accepted the task, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were intensifying their economic blockade against our country. Our country had previously ordered a set of sintering equipment from a certain capitalist country, but they thought we couldn't produce it and demanded a high price, delaying the delivery time. We were extremely indignant. To save face for our country and bring honor to Chairman Mao, we decided to produce the sintering equipment ourselves. At that time, the main components for producing this machinery required high-temperature-resistant materials. There were no theoretical references for this in books. Although there were some brief introductions in magazines, they were not specific. After accepting the task, some bourgeois technical "authorities" sneered and said, "We have never done this before, there are no references, can we really complete the task just by getting excited?" Faced with this situation, I also thought we should first clarify the theory before proceeding with the experiments. Under the influence of this incorrect thinking, we went to several research institutions in other places to find theoretical references, but we gained nothing. Because we had not united with the workers in our thinking, our experiments failed multiple times. At this time, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory discovered my active thoughts and had me participate in the factory's Mao Zedong Thought study class. They guided me to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "judging a youth's revolutionary character by whether he is willing to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants and whether he actually does so," and to reveal my private thoughts and engage in self-criticism according to Chairman Mao's requirements of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Through study, I realized that only workers are the "most intelligent, most talented, and most experienced fighters." To truly serve the people and truly combine with workers and peasants, one must respectfully regard workers as teachers and humbly learn from them. Later, I participated in the factory's workers' criticism and denunciation meeting against the revisionist line of managing enterprises promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, relying on "experts" to run the factory. The workers used living facts to severely criticize the factory's capitalist roaders who followed the Chinese Khrushchev above and relied on reactionary technical "authorities" below, never relying on the working class, turning many experiments into piles of waste. Through the criticism meeting, I clarified the direction and decided to take the path of combining with workers and peasants, reforming my worldview, and contributing my efforts to creating a set of mining sintering equipment.

After my awareness was raised, I worked with the worker masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning war from war." Without blueprints, I went to the worker masses to draw them; without references, I went to the workers to consult them. The worker comrades told me, "Little Han, we workers write references every day, writing what previous generations have not written. As long as you are with the workers, you will know where to start writing the references." The workers' education of me was immense. I saw with my own eyes how they fought day and night by the experimental furnace to bring honor to Chairman Mao and the working class. With the help of the working class, I and everyone else pooled our wisdom and collectively created a new type of heat-resistant material, opening up a new path for our country to produce heat-resistant materials for large castings.

However, the experiment encountered new difficulties. The problem of the heat-resistant casting surface sticking to sand could not be solved, and multiple experiments failed. To solve this sticking problem, a type of imported chromium ore powder was needed, but it was not available at the time. Faced with difficulties and setbacks, the thought of looking down on practice and workers and peasants resurfaced in my mind. The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the Revolutionary Committee discovered my active thoughts and organized a frontline Mao Zedong Thought study class for us, guiding the technical personnel to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Some people go to factories and rural areas, and the results are that some have gains while others have none. This is a matter of standpoint or attitude, that is, a matter of worldview." I felt that my worldview needed further reform and that I must seriously learn from the workers. From then on, the worker comrades saw that I was more humble, and they would discuss problems with me and promptly provide me with new findings. Under the leadership of the working class, I combined the experiences from other places with the specific conditions of our factory, combining the experiences gained by workers through practice with theory, deciding to use a type of coating to replace the imported chromium ore powder. After a few trials, significant effects were achieved. At this time, some workers proposed lowering the casting temperature. After experiments, in less than a month, we broke through the difficulty of the casting sticking to sand.

During the experiment, we also encountered the problem of casting cracks. What should we do? Chairman Mao taught us, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I combined with the workers, consulted with the worker comrades, and together we analyzed and researched, proposing the method of using an easy-to-cut riser. Thus, we overcame one difficulty after another and finally successfully created the new product in June this year, which has been officially put into production. This is an innovation in our country's metallurgical technology.

Over the past year, I have worked with the worker comrades on experiments and learned a lot from them. They listen to Chairman Mao the most, are the most loyal to him, and follow his great strategic deployments the closest. During the period of severe anarchist trends, they stood by the 1,000-degree high-temperature furnace to conduct experiments; when the capitalist roaders incited the masses to fight each other and disrupt the experiments, they firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resisted the evil winds and waves, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Their noble qualities of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are forever worth learning from, and they are forever my teachers. I will forever accept the leadership of the working class, forever accept the re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, combine with the workers for life, and be a technical worker welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    永远当工人阶级的小学生诚恳接受工农兵的再教育
    唐山冶金矿山机械厂技术员　韩玉忠
    我怀着万分兴奋的心情，学习了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”回忆一年来在试制一套上千吨新的矿山烧结设备中所走过的道路，和试制过程中工农兵对我不断进行再教育，使自己逐步走上了与工农相结合的道路，感到毛主席的最新指示无比英明，无比正确！
    我从学校毕业到工作岗位，已经好几年了。过去由于自己受旧教育的影响较深，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义科技路线又认识不清，没有向工人学习，拜工人为师。所以总是把自己估计得过高，把工人估计得过低。因此，在思想上和工人之间有很大的距离。
    一九六七年五月，我们厂接受了国家交给我们为某工厂生产一套烧结设备的任务。接受任务时，帝、修、反正在加紧对我国进行经济封锁。我们国家曾向某资本主义国家订购了一套烧结设备，但它以为我们国家不会制造，要高价，还拖延交货时间。我们内心非常气愤，为了给祖国争气、为毛主席争光，我们决心制造烧结设备。当时生产这套机械的主要部件，需要耐高热材料。这方面的理论资料，在书上没有读到过。虽然在一些杂志上有过点滴的介绍，但很不具体。我们接受任务后，一些资产阶级技术“权威”冷嘲热讽地说：“我们从来没有这样干过，又没资料，光凭脑子一热就能完成任务吗？”面对这种情况，我当时也是想先从理论上搞清楚，才能进行试验。在这种错误思想的支配下，我们曾先后到外地几个科研单位去找理论资料，可是一点收获也没有。由于没有从思想上和工人结合在一起，所以多次试验都失败了。这时驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志发现了我的活思想，便让我参加厂里举办的毛泽东思想学习班，引导我再学习毛主席关于“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的伟大教导，启发我按照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的要求，亮私斗私。经过学习，使我认识到：只有工人才是“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”要做到真正为人民服务，真正同工农相结合，必须恭恭敬敬地拜工人为师，老老实实向工人学习。后来，我又参加了厂里工人对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线、依靠“专家”治厂的批判控诉大会。工人同志用活生生的事实，狠狠地批判了厂内走资派上跟中国赫鲁晓夫，下靠反动技术“权威”，就是不依靠工人阶级，使许多试验变成一堆废品的滔天罪行。通过批判大会，我辨明了方向，决心要走与工农相结合的道路，改造自己的世界观，为创造一套矿山烧结设备贡献自己的力量。
    认识提高以后，我和工人群众一起，遵照毛主席“从战争学习战争”的教导，边干边学。没有图纸，我就到工人群众中去画；没有资料，我就到工人中去请教。工人同志告诉我：“小韩，咱们工人每天都在写资料，写前人没写出的资料，你只要和工人在一块，就知道资料从何写起。”工人同志对我的教育太大了，我亲眼看到他们为了给毛主席争光，给工人阶级争气，不知有多少个昼夜战斗在试验炉旁。在工人阶级帮助下，我和大家群策群力，集思广益，很快制造成功一种新型的耐热材料，为我国生产耐热材料制造大型铸件创造了新途径。
    但试验又遇到新的困难，耐热铸件表面粘砂不能解决，多次试验都失败了。解决这种粘砂需要的一种进口的铬矿粉，一时又没有。在困难和挫折面前，我头脑里轻视实践、轻视工农的思想又冒出来了。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会，发现了我的活思想，又帮我们办起火线毛泽东思想学习班，组织技术人员反复学习毛主席的教导：“有一些人到工厂农村去，结果是有的有收获，有的就没有收获。这中间有一个立场问题或者态度问题，也就是世界观的问题”，感到自己的世界观需要继续改造，必须认真地向工人学习。从此，工人同志看到我比较虚心，有问题就跟我商量，有新发现也及时向我提供。在工人阶级的领导下，我把外地的经验同本厂的具体情况结合起来，将工人经过实践所取得的经验同理论结合起来，决定采用一种涂料，来代替进口的铬矿粉。这样试验几炉后，获得了显著效果。这时，有的工人又提出降低烧铸温度的建议，经过试验，不到一个月的时间，就突破了铸件粘砂这个难题。
    在试验中还遇到铸件裂纹问题。怎么办？毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我遵照毛主席的教导，和工人相结合，向工人同志请教，和工人一起分析研究，提出了改用易割冒口的方法。就这样克服了一个又一个困难，终于在今年六月创造成功了新产品，并正式投入生产。这是我国冶金技术上的一项创新。
    一年多来，我同工人同志们一起搞试验，从工人同志身上学到了不少东西。他们最听毛主席的话，对毛主席最忠，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧。在无政府主义思潮较严重时，他们站在一千度的高温炉前进行试验；在走资派挑动群众斗群众，破坏试验时，他们坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，顶邪风，战恶浪，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们这种无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高贵品质，永远值得我学习，他们永远是我的老师。我要永远接受工人阶级的领导，永远接受工农兵对我的再教育，和工人结合一辈子，做一个受工农兵欢迎的技术员。
