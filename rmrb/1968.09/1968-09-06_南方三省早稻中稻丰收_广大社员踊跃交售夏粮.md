The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province, with deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have, after securing a bumper harvest of early rice this year, once again redoubled their efforts and overfulfilled the early rice delivery quota by 20 percent.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui, who have greatly heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, regard the early delivery of grain and the delivery of good grain as practical actions of unbounded loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. After the early rice was harvested, they launched a widespread campaign of "everyone pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao" and eagerly delivered early rice. Many production teams harvested and threshed at night and dried and transported during the day, working day and night in a rush to complete the delivery task in a few days. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants proposed during the delivery of early rice that delivering grain with high moisture content and many impurities to the state is disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, they all voluntarily selected the best upper-grade rice to deliver to the state.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi Province, with unbounded loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have, after securing a bumper harvest of both early and mid-season rice this year, enthusiastically delivered summer grain to the state. So far, the province's new grain intake has increased by more than 1.5 times compared to the same period last year, and nearly one-third of the counties have successfully overfulfilled the delivery task for both early and mid-season rice. The speed of grain delivery and the quality of the grain in various places are unprecedented.

In completing the grain procurement task, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places have followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," grasped class struggle, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticized the capitalist black goods of China's Khrushchev and his agents in grain work, such as "keeping more and selling less, distributing more and storing less," and at the same time, exposed and fought against the crimes of a handful of class enemies who incited and sabotaged grain procurement work. This has further heightened the socialist consciousness of the broad masses. Now, in grain distribution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants always put the interests and needs of the state first, insisting on the state first, the collective second. In the Jinggangshan area, many communes, after first ensuring the completion of the state procurement task, proposed the requirement of "good grain to the state, poor grain not out of the team." As long as a little wild oat is found in the grain delivered to the state, they immediately use a winnowing machine to clean it again, determined to deliver the best grain to the state.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural Hunan, after securing a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice, have eagerly delivered patriotic grain, supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and aiding in national socialist construction with practical actions. Currently, the province's grain procurement intake has increased by more than onefold compared to the same period last year. Counties along the Dongting Lake, such as Yuanjiang and Xintian, have overfulfilled the procurement task for early and mid-season rice. Many communes, production brigades, and production teams across the province have completed or overfulfilled the annual grain procurement task.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in rural Hunan, especially the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, has greatly aroused the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao. After overcoming the rarely seen floods in history and overcoming various difficulties to secure a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice, they immediately launched a campaign of "eagerly delivering patriotic grain and pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao." Each commune quickly selected and dried the best rice to sell to the state.

    广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，在夺得今年早稻丰收之后，又一鼓作气，超额百分之二十完成了早稻交售任务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中极大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的安徽广大贫下中农群众，把早交粮和交好粮，看作是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的实际行动。他们在早稻登场之后，就普遍掀起了“人人向毛主席献忠心”，踊跃交售早稻的热潮。许多社队晚上收割抢打，白天抢晒抢送，日夜突击，几天就完成了交售任务。广大贫下中农在交售早稻的时候提出：向国家交水分大杂质多的粮食，就是对毛主席的不忠。因此，他们都自觉地挑选了最好的上风稻交售给国家。江西省
    江西省
    广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，在夺得今年早、中稻全面丰收以后，以极大的热情，向国家踊跃交售夏粮。到目前为止，全省新粮入库比去年同期增加了一点五倍多，近三分之一的县已经胜利地超额完成了早中稻全部交售任务。各地送粮进度之快，粮食质量之好，都是空前未有的。
    在完成征购粮任务中，各地贫下中农和革命干部遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在粮食工作方面推行的一套“多留少售，多分少储”的资本主义黑货，同时对一小撮阶级敌人煽动破坏粮食征购工作的罪行进行了无情的揭发和斗争，进一步提高了广大群众的社会主义觉悟。现在，在粮食分配上，广大贫下中农处处把国家的利益、国家的需要放在第一位，坚持先国家，后集体。井冈山地区许多公社在首先保证完成国家征购任务的同时，广大贫下中农还提出了“好粮送国家，差粮不出队”的要求，只要发现交售给国家的粮食里有一点稗谷，都立即主动地用风车再车净一次，一定要做到以最好的粮食交给国家。
    湖南省
    湖南农村广大贫下中农和革命干部取得早中稻丰收以后，踊跃交售爱国粮，以实际行动支持无产阶级文化大革命，支援国家社会主义建设。目前，全省征购入库的粮食比去年同期增加了一倍多，洞庭湖滨的沅江、新田等县，已超额完成了早中稻征购任务。全省各地许多公社、大队和生产队都完成或超额完成了全年的粮食征购任务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想在湖南农村的大普及，特别是毛主席一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，极大地激发了广大贫下中农对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情。他们战胜了历史上罕见的水灾、克服种种困难取得了早中稻全面丰收后，立即掀起了“踊跃交售爱国粮，向毛主席敬献忠心”的热潮。各公社都迅速选晒最好的稻谷卖给国家。
