Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on educational revolution was issued, and the revolutionary teachers and students of Yugezhuang Middle School in Beijing immediately carried it out. With the help of the stationed PLA, they followed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." They immediately collaborated with the people's commune and production brigade to establish a poor and lower-middle peasants' management group in the school. Each class (grade) and squad (teaching class) is linked with a production brigade and production team, forming poor and lower-middle peasants' education groups, voluntarily accepting the management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, ensuring that the school's management power is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Yugezhuang Middle School have boldly explored the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants in school management. After establishing the revolutionary committee in May last year, with the strong support of the stationed PLA, they followed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "intellectuals must go among the workers and peasants and learn from them if they are to be of any use." Based on in-depth investigations in factories and rural areas, they proactively invited representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Lugouqiao Commune, Comrade Zhao Zhenzhao, to join the school's revolutionary committee. They frequently discussed with him major issues such as the school's ideological and political work, revolutionary criticism, class lineup purification, teaching reform, and graduate allocation. Each class (grade) is linked with a production brigade to study students' active thoughts and curriculum reform with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They frequently visit the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, hold discussions, solicit opinions on school management, and accept the management and supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also directly invited poor and lower-middle peasants to teach courses on Mao Zedong Thought, class struggle, and agricultural foundations, learning from the rich experiences of the poor and lower-middle peasants in participating in the three great revolutionary movements. They adopted the method of "going out and inviting in," bringing about a new situation in the school's educational revolution.

When the revolutionary teachers and students humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants and accepted their management, a small clique of class enemies emerged, spreading malicious rumors and attempting to maintain the rule of bourgeois intellectuals in the school. The revolutionary committee and representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants promptly exposed the enemy's plot, organizing the revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and related teachings on class struggle. This raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, leading to a large-scale exposure, criticism, and struggle against the class enemies' sabotage activities. After raising their awareness, the revolutionary teachers and students more consciously accepted the management and supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthening their ties and adopting a more sincere attitude.

The direct management of the school by the poor and lower-middle peasants quickly changed the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school and reversed the past tendency of education being detached from class struggle, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and productive labor. In the past, students were indifferent to national affairs; now they are concerned about national issues and actively participate in rural class struggles, receiving class education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, intellectuals monopolized the lectern, and theory was detached from practice, making what students learned useless; now, following the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the three courses of botany, zoology, and agricultural foundations, which were taught every year, have been combined into one course on agricultural foundations. Courses on electromechanics, fertilizers, and accounting, which meet the needs of agriculture, have been added. The curriculum is arranged according to seasonal changes and the production needs of the production teams, moving the classroom to the fields, inviting poor and lower-middle peasants to teach, and directly learning the skills of the three great revolutionary struggles. Theory is linked with practice, and what is learned is immediately applied. In the past, the school focused on professional skills but neglected politics, teaching students to read and aim for official positions; now, it emphasizes proletarian politics, firmly grasps students' active thoughts, and ensures that students act according to Mao Zedong Thought. This year, during the graduate allocation, the school held a farewell meeting, the production teams held a welcome meeting, and families held promotion meetings. One hundred percent of the commune members' children happily returned to the frontline of production. Upon arriving in the countryside, they immediately engaged in fierce class struggles, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw the tremendous changes in Yugezhuang Middle School and were genuinely pleased, saying, "Now the students educated here listen to Chairman Mao, know how to work, and the school has truly become our own school."

    贫下中农管理小组牢牢掌握学校管理大权
    岳各庄中学教育革命出现崭新局面
    迅速扭转了过去教育脱离阶级斗争、脱离工农兵群众、脱离生产劳动的倾向
    本报讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示发表后，北京市岳各庄中学广大革命师生，立即贯彻执行。他们在驻校解放军帮助下，遵照毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的伟大教导，立即同人民公社、生产大队研究，在学校建立了贫下中农管理小组，各连（年级）、排（教学班）分别与生产大队、生产队挂钩，组成贫下中农教育小组，自觉地接受贫下中农的管理，使学校的管理大权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里。
    岳各庄中学革命师生对贫下中农参加学校管理，曾经作了大胆的探索。他们去年五月成立革命委员会后，在驻校解放军的大力帮助下，遵照毛主席“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”的伟大教导，在深入工厂、农村调查的基础上，主动邀请贫下中农代表、芦沟桥公社革委会常委赵振铎同志参加了学校革命委员会，经常同他一起研究学校的思想政治工作、革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、教学改革和毕业生分配等重大问题。各连（年级）与生产大队挂钩，和贫下中农研究师生的活思想、课程改革，并经常访问贫下中农家庭，开座谈会，征求对办校的意见，接受贫下中农的管理和监督。他们还直接请贫下中农当老师，讲毛泽东思想课，讲阶级斗争课，讲农业基础课，学习贫下中农参加三大革命运动的丰富经验。他们采取这种“走出去、请进来”的办法，使学校教育革命出现了崭新的局面。
    在广大革命师生虚心向贫下中农学习，接受贫下中农管理时，一小撮阶级敌人跳了出来，煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图维持资产阶级知识分子在学校的统治。学校革委会和贫下中农代表及时识破了敌人的阴谋，组织广大革命师生反复学习毛主席的“五·七”指示和有关阶级斗争的教导，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，对阶级敌人的破坏活动，进行了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。广大革命师生提高觉悟以后，更加自觉地接受贫下中农的管理和监督，同贫下中农的联系更加密切，态度更加诚恳。
    贫下中农直接管理学校，使岳各庄中学迅速改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，扭转了过去教育脱离阶级斗争，脱离工农兵群众，脱离生产劳动的倾向。过去学生“两耳不闻窗外事”；现在他们关心国家大事，积极参加农村的阶级斗争，接受贫下中农的阶级教育。过去知识分子垄断讲台，理论脱离实际，学生学了用不上；现在按照贫下中农的意见，把过去年年要学的植物、动物和农业基础知识三门课，改为一门农基课，增设了适应农业需要的电机课、化肥课、会计课，并且按季节变化和生产队生产需要进行安排，把课堂搬到田间地头，请贫下中农当老师，直接学习三大革命斗争的本领，理论联系实际，学了就用。过去学校“抓业务不抓政治，教书不教人”，把学生引向读书、做“官”的邪路；现在突出无产阶级政治，狠抓学生的活思想，使学生处处按毛泽东思想办事。今年毕业生分配时，学校开欢送会，生产队开欢迎会，家庭开促进会，社员子女百分之百地愉快回到生产第一线。他们一到农村，就投入火热的阶级斗争，大办毛泽东思想学习班，虚心向贫下中农学习。贫下中农看到岳各庄中学发生的巨大变化，打心眼里高兴，他们说，“现在教出来的学生听毛主席的话，会生产劳动，学校真办成了咱们贫下中农自己的学校。”
