Long Live Chairman Mao!

Soaring into the world,
Over Kunlun,
Witnessing the spring of humanity.
The baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the surging east wind of Mao Zedong Thought have brought about unprecedented prosperity to the lands beneath Kunlun and north of Tian Shan.

From the Altai Grasslands to the foothills of the Karakoram, from the Pamir Plateau to the Ili River Valley, everywhere shines the golden light of the red sun, everywhere resounds the resounding songs praising Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere are tales of touching examples of love for Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's Heart Beats with the Hearts of the Revolutionary People of All Nationalities

New Xinjiang is far from the capital of our motherland, separated by thousands of rivers and mountains, but the revolutionary people of all nationalities in Xinjiang have hearts that beat as one with the great leader Chairman Mao.

On the grasslands of western Tian Shan, there is a twenty-year-old Kazakh herdsman named Aman. Once, he carried his rations, felt blanket, and bedding up to the Tike Mountain. Along the way, he passed by the Kangsou River. That day, the river was swollen, the water waist-deep and the current swift. Before entering the water, Aman thought: I must not let the copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" I am carrying get wet! He carefully wrapped the red treasure book with a towel and tucked it under his arm. Then, he led the livestock across the river. Suddenly, the swift current knocked over the pack animal, and Aman stumbled, almost falling. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," rations, and luggage all fell into the water. "Mao Zedong's book must not be lost!" The only thought that flashed through Aman's mind was to rush into the swift current and grab the red treasure book, holding it high above his head. The rations and luggage had been swept away, but Aman's wish was fulfilled; he had saved Mao Zedong's book!

Later, Aman said, "Mao Zedong's book is a priceless treasure! It is the spiritual sustenance that poor herdsmen and revolutionary people cannot do without at any moment! The mad opposition to Mao Zedong Thought by the Chinese Khrushchev—even if it costs my life, I will defend the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

In Xinjiang, there is a story circulating about a Uygur female Red Guard named Mariyam, who traveled over mountains and rivers to Mao Zedong's hometown of Shaoshan to participate in the construction of the Shaoshan Railway.

Last February, during a nationwide tour, Mariyam, a member of the Communist Youth League, heard that the hometown of the great leader Mao Zedong was to build a railway. She decided to contribute her efforts to the construction of this happy road. With boundless enthusiasm, she traveled day and night to the Shaoshan Railway construction site headquarters. The site manager, upon hearing her express her boundless love for the great leader Mao Zedong, was very pleased and accepted her.

Mariyam worked in the place where the red sun rises, feeling full of energy. She was not afraid of hardship or fatigue and always wanted to do more. Mariyam, who was twenty years old, grew up in a poor peasant family under Kunlun Mountain and had loved labor since childhood. However, they did not have the custom of carrying poles there. Now, she carried poles to transport soil, and within two days, her shoulders blistered and swelled, and the pole hurt her heart. At this moment, the glorious image of the moving of mountains by the wise old man appeared before her. Chairman Mao's great teaching of "firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" gave her immense strength. Mariyam seriously learned to carry poles from her Han brothers and sisters, enduring the pain and working every day. She had only one wish: to complete the railway as soon as possible, so that more people could come to the revolutionary holy land—Shaoshan—to be imbued with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Thus, Mariyam worked in Shaoshan for over forty days. After returning to Xinjiang, whenever she talked about her labor in Shaoshan, her emotions were always very stirred. She said, "Although we are not of the same nationality as our Han brothers, our deep class feelings for Chairman Mao are the same. We all love Chairman Mao, we are all loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, we are all loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Let us forever shout in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Let us forever sincerely wish our most red, most red red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!"

Victory Belongs to the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force and an atomic bomb of tremendous power."

The example of the members of the first pastoral cooperative established in Xinjiang—the present Dayong Commune First Brigade of Xinyuan County—relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overcome a severe snow disaster is very representative.

From December 17 to 24, 1966, a rare heavy snowfall occurred over eight days and nights on the Ili-Haratubai Kazakh grasslands, with snow accumulation over a meter deep on the ground. The seven thousand sheep, seven hundred horses, and one hundred twenty-seven herdsmen of the Dayong Commune First Brigade of Xinyuan County were trapped in Alashan. The community members at home were extremely anxious. Before the snow stopped, the brigade's livestock guidance officer, Malafu, and the old poor herdsman, Aidielbieke, led sixteen young men to brave the snowstorm and rescue people and livestock. Along the way, the snow was deep in the gullies, and the roads were all buried. In some places, snowslides blocked the path, and they failed to enter twice.

At this critical moment, Malafu and Aidielbieke organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has a spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, it will crush all enemies, and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's great teachings illuminated everyone's hearts, encouraging everyone to continue fighting, resolutely entering the mountain to rescue people and livestock. The eighteen people were all spirited, placing "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on their chests, tying iron hooks to their shoes, and advancing into Alashan again. This time, they formed a single file and advanced through the snow. When they reached a hill, the snowslide had buried the road, and the cliff beside the road was a hundred feet high. They had to cross a snow slope blocking their path. The slope was forty to fifty degrees, steep and slippery, and one false step could send them plunging into the abyss. At this moment, Malafu and Aidielbieke organized everyone to collectively recite Chairman Mao's quotations at the cliff's edge: "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength to overcome difficulties. Everyone silently recited this quotation, crawling forward, and managed to cross this fifty-meter-long icy snow slope. The eighteen people overcame various hardships and finally reached the Alashan winter pasture. Upon arriving at the scattered residences of the pasture, they immediately went to each tent, reading Chairman Mao's quotations to everyone, encouraging them to resist the disaster and protect the livestock. More than a hundred herdsmen in the winter pasture had already organized eight study groups of Chairman Mao's works, studying while resisting the disaster. At this time, everyone was even more confident, actively shoveling snow to release the sheep, cutting tree branches to feed the sheep, and driving the sheep to graze on the slopes where the snowslide had occurred. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, they created miracles, and in the face of the rare snow disaster, they still achieved increased livestock production in the second year. When summing up the victory of this anti-disaster struggle, everyone said: "Victory belongs to Chairman Mao! Victory belongs to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Vigilantly Guarding the Sacred Borders of the Motherland Day and Night

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, led by the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses it leads, against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's great teachings have made the revolutionary people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, who have been tempered by the great storms of the Cultural Revolution, more firmly establish the idea of "never forgetting class struggle." The revolutionary masses in the border communes are even more vigilant, believing: "The enemy of the sheep is the wolf. We must guard against the destructive activities of all class enemies, domestic and foreign, like guarding against wolves!" They unite with the powerful People's Liberation Army and, on the vast northwestern border of the motherland, along the thousands of kilometers of national borders, have built a true iron wall.

Late last year, on a certain night, a reactionary herdsman escaped from a border commune. The news spread, and the male and female community members were all filled with indignation, eagerly joining the battle to capture the fugitive! Everyone formed cavalry units and combat teams, cooperating with border guards, laying a net of heaven and earth over several dozen miles of land. In an instant, all mountain passes and key transportation routes were blocked. People chased after the enemy in the direction they had fled. The Kirgiz youth militia, Bositang, rolled down the snow-capped mountains several times, tearing his clothes and injuring his legs, but thinking of Chairman Mao's teaching of "to struggle is to sacrifice," he paid no heed to personal safety and continued to pursue the enemy. In the process of pursuit, many people stood guard on the mountains in temperatures below twenty degrees, and many people searched on horseback for hundreds of miles. At night, in the cold, everyone recited: "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's great teachings encouraged them to overcome the cold and bravely fight, finally capturing this counter-revolutionary.

The herdsmen, with hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and with the wisdom and bravery given to them by Mao Zedong Thought, defeated the cunning enemy, assisting the PLA in vigilantly guarding the sacred borders of the motherland day and night. The Tajik herdsman proudly said: The socialist motherland under the dictatorship of the proletariat stands tall like the Mushtagh Ice Peak, and anyone who dares to offend it will surely meet with destruction!

Kurban Tulum, an eighty-eight-year-old Uygur elder who is respected throughout Xinjiang and the country for following Chairman Mao, is still full of fighting spirit in the Cultural Revolution, following Chairman Mao's battle cry to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and class enemies in the countryside.

When the storm of the Cultural Revolution first swept through the foothills of Kunlun, Kurban Tulum went everywhere, encouraging his class brothers to care about state affairs and follow Chairman Mao in revolution. Whenever the class enemies in the village moved, they were severely struck down by the old man and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Kurban, the old man, loves the red sun in the hearts of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, infinitely. Every time he recalls the scene of riding a donkey to Beijing in the past, later becoming a model worker, and seeing his beloved Chairman Mao twice in Beijing, he looks at the photo of Chairman Mao and him together, repeatedly expressing his determination to follow Chairman Mao in revolution forever. Towards the Chinese Khrushchev, the old man harbors boundless hatred. When the village held a meeting to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, Kurban, the old man, spoke for four hours, fiercely exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the evil Chinese Khrushchev. He said: "We must chop down this rotten tree of the Chinese Khrushchev, and we must split the branches and roots, digging it out completely."

Finally, Kurban, the old man, with boundless enthusiasm, shouted with everyone: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao, may you live ten thousand years!" Kurban, the old man's shout, is the common voice of all revolutionary people of all nationalities in Xinjiang!

    亚夏，毛主席！
    横空出世，
    莽昆仑，
    阅尽人间春色。
    无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，毛泽东思想的浩荡东风，使昆仑山下、天山南北，呈现出前所未有的大好春光。
    从阿勒泰草原到喀喇昆仑山麓，从帕米尔高原到伊犁河谷，到处都闪耀着红太阳的万道金光，到处都响彻着赞颂毛泽东思想的嘹亮歌声，到处都传颂着热爱毛主席的感人事例。
  毛主席同各族革命人民心连心
    新疆和祖国的首都远隔万水千山，但是新疆各族革命人民都和伟大领袖毛主席心连着心。
    天山西部草原上，有个二十岁的哈萨克族牧工阿万。有一次，他带着口粮、毛毡、被褥上提克赛山，途中经过康苏河。这天，河水猛涨，水深齐腰，水流湍急。下水以前，阿万想：可绝不能把身上带的《毛泽东著作选读》本溅湿啊！他用毛巾把毛主席的红色宝书细心包好，夹在腋下，然后牵着牲口过河。突然，急流冲倒了驮牛，阿万也一个踉跄几乎跌倒。《毛泽东著作选读》、口粮、行李一齐掉到水里去了。“毛主席的书不能丢！”阿万脑子里闪过这唯一的念头。他立刻向急流猛扑过去，一把抓起那本红色宝书，把它高高举在头上。口粮、行李已被冲得无影无踪，但是阿万的心愿实现了，他保住了毛主席的书！
    事后，阿万说：“毛主席的书是无价之宝！是我们贫苦牧民和革命人民时刻不可缺少的精神食粮！中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，我就是牺牲了生命也要保卫伟大的毛泽东思想！”
    在新疆，流传着一位名叫玛丽娅姆的维吾尔族女红卫兵，跋山涉水到毛主席的故乡韶山，参加修建韶山铁路的动人故事。
    共青团员玛丽娅姆，去年二月在内地大串连途中，听说伟大领袖毛主席的故乡要兴修一条铁路，她就下定决心，要为这条幸福路的修建贡献自己的一份力量。于是，她满怀激情，日夜兼程来到了韶山铁路工地指挥部。工地负责人听她述说了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，非常高兴地收下了她。
    玛丽娅姆劳动在红太阳升起的地方，觉得浑身是劲。她不怕苦，不怕累，总想多出一份力。二十岁的玛丽娅姆，生长在昆仑山下一个贫农家里，从小就热爱劳动。可是，他们那里没有挑担子的习惯，现在她肩挑运土，不到两天，肩膀就起泡了，红肿了，扁担一上肩就痛得钻心。这时，愚公移山的光辉形象出现在她的眼前。毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，给了她巨大的力量。玛丽娅姆认真向汉族哥哥、姐姐们学习挑担，忍着疼痛天天坚持劳动。她只有一个心愿：早一天把铁路修好，早一天让更多的人来到革命圣地——韶山，接受伟大的毛泽东思想的熏陶。
    就这样，玛丽娅姆在韶山劳动了四十多天。她回到新疆以后，谈起在韶山参加劳动的情景时，心情总是非常激动。她说：“我们和汉族兄弟虽然不是同一个民族，但我们对毛主席的深厚阶级感情是一样的，我们都热爱毛主席，我们都忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，我们都忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。让我们永远同声高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！让我们永远衷心祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
  胜利归于战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    林彪副主席指出：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”
    新疆最早成立的第一个牧业合作社——现在的新源县东风公社第一大队的社员，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，战胜特大雪灾的事例，是很有代表性的。
    一九六六年十二月十七日到二十四日，在伊犁哈拉图拜哈萨克草原上，一连下了八天八夜几十年来罕见的大雪，平地积雪一米多深。新源县东风公社第一大队的七千只羊、七百匹马和一百二十七个牧工被困在阿拉山里。在家的社员一个个急得不得了。没等大雪停下来，大队牧业指导员马拉甫和老贫苦牧民艾德尔别克，就率领着十六个年轻小伙子，冒着风雪进山救人救羊。沿途沟洼积雪很深，道路全被埋没，一些地方雪崩阻路，他们两次都没能进去。
    在这关键的时刻，马拉甫和艾德尔别克组织大家学习毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的伟大教导，照亮了每个人的心，鼓舞着每一个人继续战斗下去，坚决进山救人救羊。十八个人个个精神焕发，在贴胸处揣上《毛主席语录》，鞋上绑着铁钩子，再一次向阿拉山进发。这一次，他们排成单行在积雪中前进。当他们走到一个山坡时，雪崩埋没了道路，路边是百丈悬崖，必须越过横切在面前的一面雪坡。雪坡四五十度，又陡又滑，一不小心就有可能坠入深谷。这时，马拉甫和艾德尔别克又组织大家在悬崖边集体背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的教导，给他们增添了克服困难的无穷的力量，他们人人默念着这条语录，匍匐着前进，硬是爬过了这个长达五十多米的冰雪斜坡。十八个人克服了种种艰难困苦，终于来到了阿拉山冬牧场。一到居住分散的牧场，他们立即奔赴各个帐篷，给大家读毛主席语录，鼓舞大家抗灾保畜。在冬牧场放牧的一百多个牧工，早已组织起八个毛主席著作学习小组，一面学习，一面抗灾。这时，大家更加信心百倍，积极铲雪放羊，砍树枝喂羊，把羊赶到雪崩过的山坡放牧……。他们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，创造了奇迹，在罕见的雪灾面前仍然夺得了第二年的牲畜增产。人们在总结这次抗灾胜利时都说：“胜利归于毛主席！胜利归于战无不胜的毛泽东思想！”
    日夜警惕地捍卫着祖国的神圣边疆
    毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一伟大教导，使得经历了文化大革命的大风大浪锻炼的新疆各族革命人民，更加牢固地树立起了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的思想。边境各公社的广大革命群众，更是警惕地认为：“羊的敌人是狼。我们要象防狼一样，严防国内外一切阶级敌人的破坏活动！”他们和强大的人民解放军团结在一起，在祖国西北边疆，在几千公里漫长的国境线上，筑起了一道真正的铜墙铁壁。
    去年年底的一个夜晚，边境某公社的一个反动牧主逃跑了。消息传开，全公社的男女社员一个个怒火满腔，争先恐后地投入战斗，誓把逃敌抓回来！大家组成骑兵队、战斗组，配合边防战士，在几十里的土地上布下天罗地网。霎时间，所有的山口、交通要道全部封锁了起来。人们朝着敌人逃跑的方向猛追。柯尔克孜族青年民兵波斯坦依几次从雪山上滚下来，衣服被扯碎了，腿跌伤了，但他想到毛主席“要奋斗就会有牺牲”的教导，便不顾个人安危，又继续追赶敌人。在追捕过程中，许多人坚持在零下二十多度的大山上站岗放哨，许多人骑马搜索几百里。夜来天寒，大家就朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的伟大教导，鼓舞着他们战胜严寒，勇敢战斗，终于逮住了这个反革命分子。
    牧民们就是这样凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，凭着毛泽东思想给予他们的机智勇敢，战胜了狡猾的敌人，协助解放军日夜警惕地捍卫着祖国的神圣边疆。塔吉克族牧民豪迈地说：无产阶级专政的社会主义祖国，好象慕士塔格冰峰一样巍然屹立，谁胆敢触犯它，必将自取灭亡！
    以紧跟毛主席而受到全疆和全国各族人民尊敬的维吾尔族老人库尔班·吐鲁木，今年已八十八岁高龄。在文化大革命中，他仍然斗志昂扬，紧跟毛主席的战斗号令，向中国赫鲁晓夫以及农村的阶级敌人猛烈进攻。
    当文化大革命的风暴刚刚席卷昆仑山下的时候，库尔班·吐鲁木就四处奔走，勉励自己的阶级兄弟要关心国家大事，紧跟毛主席干革命。村里的阶级敌人一活动，就受到了老人和广大贫下中农的狠狠打击。
    库尔班老人无限热爱各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。他每逢回想起当年打算骑着毛驴上北京，后来当了劳动模范，两次在北京见到亲人毛主席的情景，他就端详着毛主席和他合影的照片，一再表示要永远跟着毛主席干革命的决心。对于中国赫鲁晓夫，老人无比仇恨。村里召开批判中国赫鲁晓夫大会的时候，库尔班老人发言四个小时，狠狠地揭露和批判了万恶的中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。他说：“一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫这棵烂树砍倒，还要劈干削枝，连根刨掉。”
    最后，库尔班老人满怀激情地和大伙儿一起欢呼：“亚夏（万岁），毛主席！”“毛主席啊，吾宗吾木尔提来米孜（万寿无疆）！”
    库尔班老人的欢呼，就是全新疆各族革命人民的共同的心声！
