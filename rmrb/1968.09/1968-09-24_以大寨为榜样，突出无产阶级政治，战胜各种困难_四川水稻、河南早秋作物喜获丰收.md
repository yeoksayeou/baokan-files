Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Sichuan Province have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, overcome various difficulties, and achieved a bumper harvest of rice.

At present, the middle-season rice in the eastern, southern, and northern parts of Sichuan has basically completed harvesting, and the yields are generally better than in previous years. The main rice-producing areas in the western Sichuan plain are now in the midst of a tense harvesting period.

This year, the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" movement has been launched in Sichuan's rural areas on an unprecedented scale. The broad masses of commune members have taken Dazhai as their example, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and focused on revolution while vigorously promoting production.

Local revolutionary committees, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "tightly grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storage, and consumption every year," have strengthened the organizational leadership of harvesting, storing, and distributing middle-season rice. At present, the people's communes in various places are actively turning in state grain and selling surplus grain. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao through their practical actions of turning in good grain and turning it in early.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 23rd: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Henan Province have responded resolutely to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." Following the bumper harvest of wheat this year, the more than 30 million mu of early autumn crops have also achieved a bumper harvest. The late autumn crops in various places are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

At present, the autumn agricultural production situation in Henan Province is excellent. From the western mountains to the eastern plains, from the banks of the Huai River to the shores of the Yellow River, a joyful harvest scene is presented everywhere. Sorghum, corn, millet, flue-cured tobacco, and rice, among other early autumn crops, have generally been harvested. From the harvesting situation in various places, it can be seen that the yields have increased. The Nanyang, Xinyang, Zhumadian, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, and other prefectures, as well as the suburbs of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Pingdingshan, have better harvests than the bumper harvest of last year. Among them, the Nanyang Prefecture has increased production by more than 20 percent compared to last year. Many high-yield fields have emerged in various places, and many communes and production teams have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. In Lankao County, where Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, fought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution and achieved a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought.

    以大寨为榜样，突出无产阶级政治，战胜各种困难
    四川水稻、河南早秋作物喜获丰收
    据新华社成都二十三日电　四川省广大贫下中农认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大力突出无产阶级政治，战胜各种困难，夺得了水稻丰收。
    目前，川东、川南、川北地区中稻已基本收割结束，收成大都比往年好。中稻主要产区的川西平原，正在紧张收割。
    今年，四川农村开展“农业学大寨”运动，规模、声势之大超过以往任何一年。广大社员以大寨为榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想，深入开展革命大批判，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    各地革命委员会遵照毛主席的“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧”的指示，加强了中稻的收割、入仓和分配工作的组织领导。目前，各地人民公社正积极交公粮，卖余粮，广大贫下中农用交好粮、早交粮的实际行动，来表达对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    据新华社郑州二十三日电　河南省广大贫下中农坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，继夺得今年小麦丰收之后，三千多万亩早秋作物又获丰收。各地晚秋作物的长势也很好，丰收在望。
    目前，河南省秋季农业生产形势大好。从豫西山区到豫东平原，从淮河之滨到黄河两岸，到处呈现一片喜人的丰收景象。高粱、玉米、谷子、烤烟、水稻等早秋作物一般都已收割完毕，从各地收打的情况来看，产量都有所增加。南阳、信阳、驻马店、开封、新乡等专区和郑州、洛阳、开封、平顶山等市的郊区，秋季作物的收成比大丰收的去年还好。其中南阳专区比去年增产百分之二十以上。各地都涌现出很多高产田，不少社、队获得了从来没有过的大丰收。毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志生前战斗过的兰考县，广大贫下中农和革命干部发扬彻底革命精神，在大旱之年夺得了丰收。
