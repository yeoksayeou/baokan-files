    In Praise of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Managing Schools
    Song Wenbo

    The red flags flutter in the east wind for ten thousand miles,
    Revolutionary students and teachers raise their voices in joy,
    Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand in Beijing—
    Poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools,
    With hearts red, courage bold, and spirits high,
    Leading the next generation forward,
    Straight towards the broad path of communism.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools,
    Bringing the revolutionary family treasure,
    Educating the next generation not to forget class bitterness,
    Revolution to the end, unshakable.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools,
    The waves of struggle, criticism, and reform surge high,
    The power of Mao Zedong Thought is great,
    Uprooting revisionism.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools,
    The revolutionary academic style is firmly established,
    Focus on the "use" above all,
    Learning and using together is the best.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants hold the power,
    The school is transformed everywhere,
    The revolutionary red flag is held high,
    Flying forever for thousands of years.

    赞贫下中农管理学校
    宋文波
    万里东风红旗飘，
    革命师生欢声高，
    毛主席北京挥巨手——
    贫下中农管理学校。
    贫下中农管学校，
    心红胆壮志气豪，
    带领后代向前进，
    直奔共产主义康庄道。
    贫下中农管学校，
    带来革命传家宝，
    教育后代不忘阶级苦，
    革命到底不动摇。
    贫下中农管学校，
    斗、批、改掀起新高潮，
    毛泽东思想威力大，
    修正主义连根刨。
    贫下中农管学校，
    革命学风树得牢，
    “用”字上面下功夫，
    学用一致就是好。
    贫下中农掌大权，
    学校处处换新貌，
    革命红旗高高举，
    千秋万代永飘扬。
