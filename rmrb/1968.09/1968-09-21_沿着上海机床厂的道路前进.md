The great leader Chairman Mao has profoundly pointed out: "Universities must still be run. I am mainly talking about universities for science and engineering. However, the system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice."

In Shanghai, Comrade Ke Qing-shi, a good student of Chairman Mao, followed the teachings of Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," and in 1958 proposed to the revolutionary people of the entire city the task of "flourishing science and culture and striving to create a large contingent of proletarian intellectuals within ten years." In just the three short years from 1959 to 1961, Shanghai cultivated and promoted more than 12,000 engineering and technical personnel from among outstanding workers.

The growth of tens of thousands of technical personnel from the working class vividly illustrates the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on "cultivating technical personnel from among workers"!

The growth process of Zhu Fu-lin, a worker-engineer from Shanghai Tool Factory, shows:

The working class is the most intelligent and talented.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." "The lowly are the most intelligent! The noble are the most stupid."

Zhu Fu-lin, a member of the Communist Party and a worker-engineer from Shanghai Tool Factory, is one of the first batch of worker-engineers cultivated in Shanghai. Now, he is a member of the revolutionary committee of the factory workshop. This worker from a poor peasant family suffered exploitation and oppression from imperialists, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and capitalists in the old society. He had no education, but he had deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary cause. Through long-term labor practice, he accumulated rich experience. He combined his practical experience with scientific theory, broke superstitions, and conquered high-tech fortresses in tool making, leaving those bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" and bourgeois philistines dumbfounded.

With the rapid development of socialist construction, the demand for micro-tools used in the manufacture of high-level precision instruments and telecommunications equipment is increasing. These tools are as small as matchsticks, with the smallest being as thin as a hair, and the precision requirements are very high. In early 1960, Shanghai Tool Factory received a task to trial-manufacture micro drills. This cutting-edge product is finer than a sewing needle, with two complex helical grooves on it, and it had to be trial-manufactured within five days. Zhu Fu-lin, with an excited heart, formed an experimental team with workers, young technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres to bravely shoulder this heavy responsibility. They understood that quickly producing such micro drills would fill a gap in China's tool production, supporting the socialist revolution and construction, and countering the blockade by imperialism and revisionism against China, which had great significance.

There were no technical data or specialized processing equipment. What to do? Zhu Fu-lin and his comrades-in-arms firmly believed in one thing: with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, any difficulty can be overcome. Some technical "authorities" in the factory proposed that trial-manufacturing micro tools required four conditions: a full set of automated machine tools, a full set of constant temperature equipment, and an operating workshop that was dust-free and shockproof. The factory did not have these conditions, so it could not be done. Zhu Fu-lin and other workers braved the cold wind, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and with the concern and support of the entire factory's workers, they rolled up their sleeves and decided to complete this arduous task in five days.

In these five days, Zhu Fu-lin's experimental team worked day and night. In the workshop without constant temperature and shockproof, dustproof equipment, next to three simple machine tools they modified themselves, they studied and experimented over and over again. One plan failed, they tried another. Although the difficulties were great, they were not discouraged. Zhu Fu-lin used his brain and put all his practical experience to use. The most troublesome part of the trial-manufacturing process was "grinding the outer circle," which required grinding high-speed steel rods thinner than a sewing needle. However, during grinding, they would either bend or break, or even fly off the machine. Later, he thought of children playing with tops, which would not fall over because of their speed. If the machine's speed was increased, wouldn't the problem be solved? He tried it, and it worked. Zhu Fu-lin and his comrades-in-arms thus tried again and again, conducting a total of 228 experiments, finally producing micro drills that met all quality standards within five days.

The successful trial-manufacturing and batch production of micro tools greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and dampened the spirits of the bourgeoisie. Now, the production of micro tools is increasing month by month, with output several times higher than before the Cultural Revolution, and the variety and specifications have developed to more than 100.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Through practice, truth is discovered, and through practice, truth is verified and developed." The fact that Zhu Fu-lin and the workers together produced micro tools eloquently shows that the working class, with the most practical experience, once they grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought and scientific and cultural knowledge, their intelligence and talent will burst forth endlessly, and they will be able to discover truth and create miracles for socialism.

The growth process of Ding Xing-qing, an engineer from Shanghai Switch Factory, shows:

The working class is selfless and daring in revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among workers, a large number of cadres should be educated. They should have knowledge and ability, not pursue empty fame, and be able to do practical work." Ding Xing-qing, a worker-engineer from Shanghai Switch Factory and a member of the Communist Party, is such a practical worker of the proletariat.

In 1960, Ding Xing-qing was sent to Shanghai Municipal Evening Industrial University to study. He was filled with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and he studied diligently and earnestly. He believed that going to school was not just for his own learning; he had to study for the Party, for the country, and for the working class.

Ding Xing-qing, who came from a poor peasant family, went to Shanghai at the age of 14 to become an apprentice worker, and had only studied for three and a half years. In the early days of liberation, he was still semi-illiterate. When he entered Shanghai Municipal Evening Industrial University, his foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry was poor, and he could not even draw sketches. However, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, he studied diligently and not only mastered these basic knowledge in just four years but also applied them well. He used what he learned to make 16 large and small inventions and technological innovations, and when he graduated, he and some other students designed a hydraulic copying lathe, completing a full set of technical data through complex calculations.

Whether in school or in the factory, Ding Xing-qing's mind was always on how to improve production and build socialism quickly and efficiently. As long as it was needed for production, he dared to take on big research projects and small technological innovations. He went wherever he was needed. This was in stark contrast to the reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory who chased after fame and status, were full of airs, dared not take on big projects, and did not want to take on small ones.

Some machine tools and parts in the factory were prone to wear and tear, such as axles and bearings, which often needed to be replaced, wasting national resources and time. Ding Xing-qing returned from school and worked as a cadre in the power workshop. In his work, he and an old worker named Zhang noticed this ordinary matter. They immediately thought of the new technology of "plastic spraying" in the factory's central laboratory, which sprayed a type of plastic onto metal to make it wear-resistant. If this method was used to repair worn-out mechanical parts, the parts could be repaired and new ones would not need to be replaced frequently. However, when they tried it, the spray gun's high temperature caused the mechanical parts to deform, and the experiment failed. But they did not give up. They thought of Chairman Mao's brilliant teaching: "Any new thing's growth is bound to be tortuous. In socialist construction, if one wants to avoid difficulties and twists and turns, not pay a great price, and always have smooth sailing and easily achieve success, this is just a fantasy." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts greatly encouraged them. It was precisely because they had no mental shackles, no burdens, and no personal gains or losses that they finally found a good way to spray plastic onto parts to repair them without deformation. For example, a type of drainpipe, with acid in the water, would be corroded in three months. After using plastic spraying, the life of the pipe was greatly extended, and it had not been replaced for one or two years.

Ding Xing-qing said: I have some technical skills, all thanks to Chairman Mao's cultivation. I will dedicate the technology I have learned to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the proletarian revolutionary cause. He not only worked selflessly and devotedly in the factory but also helped solve problems whenever other factories encountered difficulties in production. Whether it was improving drills to increase the smoothness of drilling or large automatic control devices for lathes, he would share the technical keys with others; he would even give up rest to deliver treasures to other factories and solve many problems for them.

Selflessness, not seeking fame or gain, is the worldview of the proletariat and the excellent political quality unique to the proletariat. Only with great selflessness can one have great courage, and only with selflessness can one be fearless. Ding Xing-qing, this worker who had been operating a lathe for more than 20 years, made his contribution to the socialist revolution and construction after a few years of schooling, which is a vivid example.

The growth process of Wang Pei-zhou, an engineer from Shanghai Second Steel Plant, shows:

Cultivating technical personnel from among workers is full of class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat and will make their last struggles." The reactionary technical "authorities" who usurped the leadership of production technology in factories before the Cultural Revolution will not deviate from this law. The growth process of many technical personnel from the working class in Shanghai has been a process of fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads from beginning to end.

Wang Pei-zhou, this engineer from the working class and a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee of Shanghai Second Steel Plant, has a particularly deep understanding of this class struggle and the struggle between two lines.

Before the Cultural Revolution, the key technical departments of Shanghai Second Steel Plant were controlled by reactionary technical "authorities." These people, under the protection of the capitalist roaders, ridiculed and attacked worker-technical personnel, and in their work, they set difficult problems, did not provide tools, and used various means to harass and suppress worker-technical personnel. They sneered at Wang Pei-zhou as a "country bumpkin," "having no ink in his stomach," defamed Wang Pei-zhou as a "fake labor model" and "gold-plated copper medal," and even fabricated "ten major crimes" to try to strike down this worker-engineer with one blow. These reactionaries' plots to attack Wang Pei-zhou were actually aimed at Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fiercely resisting the cultivation of technical personnel from among workers and opposing the working class seizing the leadership of production technology. Facing the ferocious class enemies, Wang Pei-zhou was fearless and insisted on fighting back. He thought of Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionaries are paper tigers," which added boundless revolutionary courage and strength.

Wang Pei-zhou and his experimental team, in solving the problem of the quality of automatic welding repair of rolling mill rolls, engaged in a sharp struggle with the reactionary technical "authorities."

Automatic welding repair of rolling mill rolls is a new technology in the steel rolling industry. Wang Pei-zhou and the veteran teachers of the experimental team bravely undertook the research task of this new technology. However, they encountered the cold mockery of the reactionary "experts": "Automatic welding repair of rolling mill rolls is the 'tiger's ass,' it's not easy to touch; let him try, see if he gets eaten by the tiger turning around and biting him." Wang Pei-zhou, knowing that there were tigers in the mountains, went to the tiger mountain, determined to boost the morale of the working class. He kept his composure and worked diligently, first seeking advice from old workers with electrical welding experience. He personally pulled a cart, sending a broken welding machine to the repair shop to fix it, and conducted repeated experiments on this welding machine. Combining the electrical engineering knowledge he learned at the evening industrial university, he finally successfully solved the quality problem of automatic welding repair of rolling mill rolls. This new technology, once promoted, immediately boosted production. This ironclad fact gave a resounding slap in the face to the so-called "noble" expert who had eaten a lot of ink.

Once, a reactionary "expert" deliberately assigned the trial-manufacturing task of a new agricultural tool made of a new type of steel to Wang Pei-zhou. This task was relatively complex and arduous, and for Wang Pei-zhou, who was still learning technical theory, there were even more difficulties. This person also hypocritically said: "You are doing this complex thing, it's a good exercise." Wang Pei-zhou knew this was intentional harassment, a reflection of class struggle. He thought that trial-manufacturing this new product was a practical action in response to the Party's call to support agriculture, and the task must be completed to suppress the arrogance of the reactionary "expert."

Wang Pei-zhou worked day and night, forgetting to rest. He drew one sketch after another; he revised the design plan again and again. He drew a total of 20 sketches and finally succeeded in the design. Who would have thought that when it came to the trial, this reactionary "expert" played another trick. He colluded with some people, insisting that the product designed by Wang Pei-zhou was too heavy on the machine and not allowing the trial. However, the workers supported Wang Pei-zhou, everyone offered ideas, and everyone contributed strategies, adjusting the temperature and speed, and successfully completed the trial in one go. This reactionary "expert" could not come up with anything himself, but he deliberately harassed Wang Pei-zhou. When Wang Pei-zhou succeeded, he ran to the workshop, took a photo of this new product, shamelessly went to the superiors to claim credit and rewards, and stole the labor achievements of Wang Pei-zhou and the worker masses.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wang Pei-zhou, together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai Second Steel Plant, held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," seized back the power usurped by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," kicked away the stumbling blocks that hindered the working class from playing their creative role, and gave Wang Pei-zhou and the worker masses another spiritual and technical liberation. Today, in Shanghai Second Steel Plant, those who were suppressed and attacked by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" have firmly grasped the production technology power of the factory. A contingent of worker-engineers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is growing healthily. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory are full of spirit and fighting spirit, advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously improving their political awareness in the struggle, and welcoming the new wave of industrial revolution that is about to come.

### 沿着上海机床厂的道路前进

专栏：

    沿着上海机床厂的道路前进
    伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”
    在上海，毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志遵循毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》这两部光辉文献的教导，在一九五八年向全市革命人民提出了“繁荣科学文化，争取在十年内造成一支宏大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍”的任务。上海仅在一九五九年到一九六一年的短短三年里，就从优秀的工人中培养和提拔了一万二千多名工程技术人员。
    成千上万工人出身的技术人员成长的过程，生动地说明了伟大领袖毛主席关于“从工人中培养技术人员的道路”这一最新指示的无比英明，无比正确！
    上海工具厂工人工程师朱富林的成长过程表明：
    工人阶级最聪明最有才能
    毛主席教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。
    共产党员、上海工具厂的朱富林，是上海第一批培养的工人工程师中的一个。现在，他是工具厂车间革命委员会的成员。这个贫农家庭出身的工人，在旧社会当过学徒，做过短工，饱受帝国主义、国民党反动派和资本家的剥削和迫害。他没有文化，但是对毛主席、对无产阶级革命事业，有着深厚的无产阶级感情，在长期的劳动实践中积累了丰富的经验。他把实践经验和科学理论结合起来，打破迷信，在刀具制造上攻克了高精尖的技术堡垒，使那些跟在洋人屁股后面爬行的资产阶级反动技术“权威”和资产阶级庸人目瞪口呆。
    随着社会主义建设的飞速发展，制造高级精密仪表、电讯器材需用的微型刀具的需要量日益增长。这类刀具不过火柴梗那样大小，最小的只有头发丝那样粗细，精度要求很高。一九六○年初，上海工具厂接到一项试制微型钻头的任务，这种尖端产品，比绣花针还细，上面还要加工两条复杂的螺旋槽，而且要求在五天内试制完成。朱富林怀着兴奋的心情，和工人、青年技术人员、革命干部一起组成试验小组，勇敢地挑起了这副重担。他们懂得，迅速做出这种微型钻头，填补我国刀具生产上的一项空白，对支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设，对反击帝国主义、修正主义对我国的封锁，都有着重大的意义。
    没有技术资料，没有专门的加工设备，怎么办？朱富林和他的战友们坚信一条：有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，天大的困难也可以克服。厂里有些技术“权威”提出，试制微型刀具必须具备四个条件：全套自动化机床，全套恒温设备，防尘、防震的操作工场。而厂里没有这些条件，因此不能做。朱富林和其他工人顶住冷风，遵循毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，在全厂工人的关心和支持下，动起手来，决心五天完成这个艰巨的任务。
    在这五天里，朱富林试验小组都在日夜工作。他们在没有恒温和防震、防尘设备的车间里，在三台自己改装的简陋机床旁边，一次一次地研究、试验，一种方案试验不成功，再试验一种。尽管困难很大，他们却毫不气馁。朱富林开动脑筋，把他的实践经验都用上了。试制过程中，最棘手的是“磨外圆”，要把高速钢条磨得比绣花针还细，可是磨的时候不是弯曲，就是折断，甚至于从机床上飞掉。后来他想到孩子们玩陀螺，因为速度快，陀螺就不会倒，如果加快机床转速，这问题不就可以解决了吗？开车一试，果然成功。朱富林和战友们就这样一试再试，前后进行了二百二十八次试验，终于在五天内做出了质量规格完全合乎标准的微型钻头。
    微型刀具试制成功并且能够成批生产，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。现在，微型刀具的生产月月上升，产量比文化大革命以前成倍增长，品种规格已发展到一百多种。
    毛主席教导说：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。”朱富林和工人们一起制成微型刀具的事实，雄辩地说明，最有实践经验的工人阶级，一旦掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，掌握了科学文化知识，他们的聪明才智就无穷无尽地迸发出来，就能发现真理，为社会主义创造奇迹。
    上海开关厂车工出身的工程师丁杏清的成长过程表明：
    工人阶级最大公无私敢于革命
    毛主席教导我们：“工人中间应该教育出大批的干部，他们应该有知识，有能力，不务空名，会干实事。”上海开关厂车工出身的工人工程师、共产党员丁杏清，就是这样一个无产阶级的实干家。
    一九六○年，丁杏清被送到上海市业余工业大学学习。他满怀对毛主席、对共产党无比深厚的无产阶级感情，踏踏实实、刻苦钻研。他认为，进学校，不是单纯为自己学习，要为党、为国家、为工人阶级争气而学习。
    贫农家庭出身的丁杏清，十四岁就从农村到上海当学徒工，只读过三年半书，解放初期还是个半文盲。他进上海市业余工业大学时，数、理、化的基础知识很差，草图也不会画，但是，他怀着一颗对毛主席的忠心，刻苦钻研，不但在短短的四年里掌握了这些基础知识，而且活学活用得很好。他用学到的知识，一连搞了十六项大大小小的创造发明和技术革新，毕业的时候，他和另外一些同学设计油压仿型车床，通过繁复的计算，搞出了整套的技术资料。
    无论是在学校、在工厂，丁杏清的脑子里经常考虑的不是个人的名誉、地位，而是怎样搞好生产，多快好省地建设社会主义。只要为了生产需要，他大的研究项目敢干，小的技术革新也搞，那里需要就到那里去。这同厂里那些反动技术“权威”一味追求名利、地位，架子十足，大的不敢搞，小的不愿搞的情况，成了鲜明的对照。
    工厂里有些机器设备的零件容易磨损，例如轴、轴承，经常要更换，既要国家多花钱，又费时间。丁杏清从学校回来，在动力车间当干部。他在劳动中，和一个姓张的老工人注意到了这个普通事情。他们马上联想到厂里中心试验室搞的新工艺“塑料喷涂”，把一种塑料喷涂在金属上，可以耐磨，如果把这种办法用来修补磨损的机械零配件，就可以使零件修复，不要经常更换新的。但是拿来一试，用喷枪喷涂塑料，温度太高，机械零件就会变形，没有试验成功。但他们没有气馁，他们想到毛主席的光辉教导：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”毛主席的光辉思想极大地鼓舞了他们。正是因为他们思想上没有框框，没有包袱，没有个人的成败得失，他们终于摸索到了在零件上既能涂塑料修补又不会变形的好办法。例如有一种下水管，水中带有酸性，管子三个月就被腐蚀。用了塑料喷涂，管子的寿命大为延长，一、二年也没有换过。
    丁杏清说：我能有一些技术，都是毛主席培养的结果，我要把学到的技术献给伟大领袖毛主席，献给无产阶级革命事业。他不仅在厂里踏踏实实忘我地工作，别的工厂生产上碰到疑难问题，他也是尽量想办法帮助解决。小的如改进钻头，提高钻孔光洁度，大的如车床自动控制装置，他都把技术关键告诉别人；甚至放弃休息，给其他工厂送宝上门，为其他工厂解决许多难题。
    大公无私，不为名、不为利，是无产阶级的世界观，是无产阶级所特有的优秀的政治品质。大公才有大勇，无私才能无畏。丁杏清，这个捏了二十多年摇手柄的车工，进了几年学校，在社会主义革命、社会主义建设事业中作出了自己的贡献，就是一个鲜明的例证。
    上海第二钢铁厂工人出身的工程师王佩洲的成长过程表明：
    从工人中培养技术人员充满着阶级斗争
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”无产阶级文化大革命前窃踞工厂生产技术领导大权的资产阶级反动技术“权威”，同样不会违背这条规律。上海许多工人出身的技术人员的成长过程，自始至终是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的过程。
    王佩洲，这个工人出身的工程师，上海第二钢铁厂革命委员会的常委，对这场阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，感受特别深刻。
    文化大革命以前，上钢二厂的技术要害部门控制在资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里。这些家伙在走资派的庇护下，讽刺、打击工人技术人员，在工作中用出难题、不给工具等手段，刁难、压制工人技术人员。他们讥笑王佩洲是“土包子”，“肚子里没有墨水”，诬蔑王佩洲是“假劳模”、“镀金铜牌”，甚至捏造“十大罪状”，妄图把这个工人工程师一棍子打死。这些反动家伙攻击王佩洲的阴谋，实际上是把矛头指向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，猖狂抵制从工人中培养技术人员，反对工人阶级掌握生产技术领导权。面对凶恶的阶级敌人，王佩洲毫不畏惧，坚持斗争。他想到毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的教导，增添了无限的革命勇气和力量。
    王佩洲和他的试验小组在解决自动焊补轧辊质量这个任务中，同反动技术“权威”展开了一场尖锐的斗争。
    自动焊补轧辊是轧钢工业的一项新技术，王佩洲和试验小组的老师傅们勇敢地承担了这项新技术的研究任务。但是却碰到了反动“专家”的冷嘲热讽：“自动焊补轧辊是‘老虎屁股’，不好摸的；让他去试试，看他被老虎回头一口吃掉。“王佩洲”明知山有虎，偏向虎山行”，决心要长工人阶级的志气。他沉住气，踏踏实实地干下去，首先向有电焊经验的老工人请教。自己拖着大车，把一台破旧的焊接机送到修理厂去修好，就在这台焊接机上反复实验，结合在业余工业大学学到的电工学知识，终于成功地解决了自动焊补轧辊的质量问题。这项新技术一推广，立即推动了生产。这个铁铮铮的事实，给了那个所谓“高贵的”墨水吃得多的“专家”一记响亮的耳光。
    还有一次，一个反动“专家”故意把用新钢种制造一种农具的试制任务交给王佩洲。这项任务比较复杂、艰巨，对正在学习技术理论的王佩洲来说困难更多。这个家伙还假惺惺地说：“你搞这个复杂的东西，锻炼锻炼。”王佩洲知道这是有意刁难他，是阶级斗争的反映。他想，试制这个新产品，是响应党的号召支援农业的实际行动，一定要完成任务，把反动“专家”的气焰打下去。
    王佩洲夜以继日，废寝忘食地干。图纸画了一张又画一张；设计方案改了一次再改一次。他一连画了二十张图纸，终于设计成功了。谁知道，在投入试验的时候，这个反动“专家”又耍出了诡计。他串通一些人，硬说王佩洲设计的产品放在机器上负荷太重，不准试验。但是，工人们支持王佩洲，个个出主意，人人献计谋，调整了温度和速度，一举试验成功。这个反动“专家”自己搞不出名堂，又百般刁难王佩洲，等到王佩洲搞成功了，他却跑到车间里，拍了这个新产品的照片，恬不知耻地去向上级讨功请赏，盗窃了王佩洲和工人群众的劳动成果。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，王佩洲和上钢二厂无产阶级革命派、革命群众一道，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，把走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”窃踞的大权夺了回来，踢开了阻碍工人阶级发挥创造才能的绊脚石，使王佩洲和工人群众在精神上、技术上得到了又一次解放。今天，在上钢二厂，被走资派、反动技术“权威”压制、打击的卑贱者，已经把工厂的生产技术大权，牢牢掌握在自己手里。一支无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的工人出身的技术队伍，正在健康地成长。全厂革命工人意气风发、斗志昂扬，正沿着毛主席的革命路线前进，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，迎接即将到来的新的工业革命的高潮。
