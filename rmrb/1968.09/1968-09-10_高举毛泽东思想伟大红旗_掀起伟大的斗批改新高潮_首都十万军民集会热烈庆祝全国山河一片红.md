In the midst of the excellent situation where the entire country (excluding Taiwan Province) is red, ten million military personnel and civilians in the capital, filled with the joy of victory, solemnly held a "Grand Meeting to Celebrate the Establishment of Revolutionary Committees in All Provinces, Municipalities, and Autonomous Regions Across the Country (excluding Taiwan Province)" on September 7. They enthusiastically hailed the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! They enthusiastically hailed the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! They resolved to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform with victory in hand.

Leaders from the Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other departments, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faqian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng, attended the meeting.

In recent days, our great capital has been filled with a festive atmosphere of great revolution. At the celebration meeting held in the Beijing Workers' Stadium on September 7, ten million military personnel and civilians were in high spirits, enthusiastically cheering for the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminating the entire country turning red. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing made important speeches at the meeting (the full texts will be published separately).

In his speech, Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, congratulated the people of the capital and the people of all ethnic groups across the country.

Zhou Enlai said, "Now, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

In his speech, Zhou Enlai emphasized the issue of the military and people of the entire country achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "In the face of an excellent situation both internationally and domestically, we must, under the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, and under the unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, unify our thoughts, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and welcome the new high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform that we are currently launching. Zhou Enlai also talked about the task of the military and people of the entire country to definitely liberate Taiwan.

Zhou Enlai said, "Our current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest, most thorough, and most comprehensive political and military mobilization. If the enemy abroad dares to invade us, we will, according to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them."

Jiang Qing talked about the great achievements made by revolutionary youth and Red Guards in the early and middle stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She said, "The working class must protect the Red Guards, help them, and educate them."

Jiang Qing emphasized in her speech that under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, the main force of the working class has taken the stage of struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure. The People's Liberation Army is the backup. Red Guards and all teachers and staff who are willing to revolutionize should be welcomed and follow the leadership.

Jiang Qing suggested in her speech that everyone should study well the editorial note published in the September 5 issue of the People's Daily by the Red Flag magazine, which represents the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao.

Jiang Qing said, "We must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, be humble, be patient, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance to victory!"

The speeches by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing sparked wave after wave of thunderous applause throughout the venue.

The meeting was presided over by Xie Fuzhi, the chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Wu De, the vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, gave a speech.

Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards, and Middle School Red Guards, representatives from the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, and representatives from the Beijing-based units of the People's Liberation Army spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the wise call of our great leader Chairman Mao to seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and reform, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely implement every new directive of Chairman Mao, and to resolutely carry out every battle order of the proletarian headquarters. They will further develop the excellent revolutionary situation and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause, passed a letter of respect to our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao.

The meeting was filled with a high revolutionary fighting spirit. Ten million military personnel and civilians repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Unlimited loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Thoroughly criticize the reactionary 'multi-center theory' of the bourgeoisie!" "The working class must lead everything!" "Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and reform!" "Grasp the revolution and promote production! Launch a new high tide of revolution and production! Welcome the National Day with practical actions!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries in the world!" "Definitely liberate Taiwan!" "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long, long live!"
