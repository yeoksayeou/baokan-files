    A strong political ideology is the main standard for assessing the combat effectiveness of a unit, and for evaluating the quality of flight training. This has always been the main content of the struggle between two military ideologies and two military lines within the aviation units.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. If there is no progressive political spirit permeating the army, and no progressive political work to carry out this permeation, it will not be possible to achieve true unity between officers and soldiers, nor to arouse the maximum war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers. All techniques and tactics will not be able to play their due roles on this basis."

    The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai dared to raise the black flag of bourgeois "military first" and "technology first," madly opposing Chairman Mao's military ideology and line. He even publicly shouted: "In the future, when assessing the combat effectiveness of our army units... it should be based on the quality of military training performance as the basic standard." According to this saying, as long as the technology is strong, there will definitely be great combat effectiveness. Nonsense! It's sheer nonsense.

    Countless facts prove: Without arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how advanced the technology is, it is useless and cannot win battles. Only revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat effectiveness. Our unit once trained a pilot, Liu Yuming, who is the son of a poor peasant. He studies Chairman Mao's works well and has a high level of proletarian consciousness. However, his cultural level is not high, and he encountered many difficulties in mastering flight technology. At that time, someone said: "Such a pilot, operating the aircraft so rigidly, with several unsatisfactory assessment results, if he goes to war, he will still be a 'live target.'"

    Soon, during a flight, just as the aircraft had taken off, the engine suddenly stopped. If the operation was slightly incorrect, the aircraft and the person would be destroyed, but Liu Yuming thought of Chairman Mao's great teachings of "bravery, firmness, and calmness," and decisively operated the aircraft to make an emergency landing outside the field. When the aircraft descended to about thirty meters, he suddenly discovered that there were more than ten community members working in the emergency landing area. What to do? Should he turn to avoid the crowd, protect the people, and sacrifice himself, or should he land directly, sacrifice the people, and preserve himself? At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's great teachings of "dying for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" echoed in his ears. Liu Yuming, disregarding his personal safety, resolutely pressed a large slope, landing the aircraft on a narrow embankment, and protected the more than ten community members on the scene.

    What power inspired him to bravely and decisively handle this special situation without fear of sacrifice? It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is bravery, fearlessness of death! Liu Yuming's heroic deeds gave a powerful refutation to the reactionary fallacy of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's so-called "training performance excellence" as the "basic standard" for assessing the high and low combat effectiveness of a unit.

    At any time, under any circumstances, compared to technology, the human factor is always the primary factor in combat effectiveness. Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat effectiveness. What are the Americans' Davis and Edward, what are the "Lightning" and "Phantom"? They are all nothing. Peng Dehuai's attempt to weaken and eliminate our army's political ideology work, to remove the soul of our army, and to turn our revolutionary soldiers into mechanical beings who only know how to fly planes and fire cannons but have no soul, in order to realize his dream of restoring capitalism, is sheer fantasy.

    政治思想过硬是考核战斗力的主要标准
    空军某部飞行大队长　管怀忠  五好战士　蔡文明
    用什么样的标准考核部队的战斗力，考核部队的飞行训练质量，一直是飞行部队中两种建军思想、两条建军路线斗争的主要内容。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力”。
    反革命修正主义分子彭德怀，竟敢扯起资产阶级“军事第一”、“技术第一”的黑旗，疯狂地反对毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。他甚至公开叫嚷：“今后考核我军一个部队战斗力的时候……而是要以那个部队的军事训练战绩的优劣为基本标准。”按照这种说法，只要技术过得硬，就一定有很大的战斗力了。呸！简直是胡说八道。
    无数的事实证明：不用毛泽东思想武装头脑，技术再尖，也没有什么用，是打不了胜仗的。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，才是最大的战斗力。我们部队曾经训练了这样一个飞行员，他是贫农的儿子刘玉明。他毛主席著作学得好，无产阶级觉悟高。但是他文化水平不高，掌握飞行技术遇到了不少困难。当时有人说：“这样的飞行员，飞机操纵得这么死板，几次考核成绩都不理想，打起仗来还不是一个‘活靶子’。”
    不久，他在一次飞行中，当飞机刚刚离地面时，发动机突然停车了。如果操纵稍微不当，就会机毁人亡，但是刘玉明同志想到了毛主席“勇敢、坚定、沉着”的伟大教导，果断地操纵飞机进行场外迫降。当飞机下降到三十多米时，突然发现迫降地带有十几名社员正在劳动。怎么办？是转舵避开人群，保护人民牺牲自己，还是照直迫降，牺牲人民保存自己？在这千钧一发之际，毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的伟大教导响在他的耳边。刘玉明同志不顾个人安危，毅然决然地压了一个大坡度，将飞机降落在一个狭小的田埂上，保护了在场的十几名公社社员。
    是什么力量鼓舞着他不怕牺牲、英勇果断地处理了这次特殊情况呢？是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！是勇敢，不怕死！刘玉明同志的英勇事迹给了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀和罗瑞卿的所谓“训练成绩优劣”是考核部队战斗力高低的“基本标准”的反动谬论一个有力回击。
    无论在什么时候，在什么情况下，技术与人相比，人的因素永远是战斗力诸因素中的首要因素。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才是最大的战斗力。什么美国的戴维斯、爱德华，什么“雷公式”、“鬼怪式”，统统不在话下。彭德怀妄想用“训练成绩”的优劣来削弱、取消我军的政治思想工作，抽去我军的灵魂，把我们革命战士变成机械的，只懂得开飞机、放大炮而没有灵魂的人，实现他复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，这完全是痴心妄想。
