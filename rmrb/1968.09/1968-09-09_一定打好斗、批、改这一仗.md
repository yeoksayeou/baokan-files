The revolutionary committees of Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions have been born in glory, and the entire country has turned red. This signifies that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. To do well in struggle, criticism, and transformation is an important battle in our struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and also an important task facing our revolutionary committees at all levels.

I am the head of the commune revolutionary committee. In this battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to link up with the masses," learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, be a small student of the masses, do a good job in investigation and research, grasp typical examples, and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. I will definitely ensure the completion of the glorious task given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao, and will not stop until complete victory is achieved.

Since our commune established the revolutionary committee in March, I have been living and eating with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and have been working, studying, and carrying out great criticism together with them. During this time, I discovered many problems that I had not noticed before and solved many problems that I could not solve before. For example, the irrigation problem of 1,800 mu of land in three brigades, Shicuihe, Houliantuan, and Qianliantuan, which had not been solved before, was finally resolved this time. Through discussions with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I listened to their opinions and adopted the method of digging wells to draw water. In Shilou Brigade, there was an enemy who had infiltrated the Party for more than 20 years. This enemy had not been exposed before, but this time, after 29 days of investigation and research among the masses, and mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, the enemy was finally exposed, and many weapons were seized.

I have come to realize that Chairman Mao's great teachings of "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." and "The masses are the real heroes" are absolutely true. To do well in struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm and creativity. Only then can problems be solved, tasks be completed, and difficulties be overcome.

    新疆、西藏两个自治区的革命委员会光荣诞生，全国山河实现一片红，这标志着我国的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个斗、批、改的新阶段。搞好斗、批、改，是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中的重要一仗。这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，也是当前摆在我们各级革命委员会面前的重要任务。
    我是公社革命委员会的负责人，在这场斗、批、改的战斗中，我一定遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，拜贫下中农为师，做群众的小学生，做好调查研究，抓好典型，虚心听取群众意见。一定要保证圆满地完成党和毛主席交给我的光荣任务，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    今年三月我们公社建立革命委员会以后，我吃住在贫下中农家里，和群众坚持五同（吃、住、劳动、学习、大批判）。在五同过程中，我发现了很多过去没有发现的问题，解决了许多过去解决不了的问题。例如石泗河、后两连、前两连三个大队一千八百亩地的灌溉问题，过去没有解决，这次，我通过同贫下中农座谈，听取他们的意见，采取打土井引水的方法，终于把这个问题解决了。在时楼大队有一个混进党内二十多年的敌人，过去没有揪出来，这次我深入群众，进行了二十九天的调查研究，并深入发动群众，开展革命大批判，终于把这个阶级敌人揭发出来了，还缴了很多武器。
    我体会到，毛主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“群众是真正的英雄”的伟大教导，是千真万确的真理。搞好斗、批、改，也必须相信群众、依靠群众、充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，问题才能解决，任务才能完成，困难才能克服。
