Lao patriotic military and civilians advance victoriously, expanding battle results. In the first three months of the rainy season, they bravely counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations, annihilating more than a thousand enemy soldiers.

KANGO, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the local forces and guerrilla units of Laos have achieved a brilliant victory of annihilating more than a thousand enemy soldiers in the first three months of the rainy season.

The broadcast said that after entering the rainy season, the Lao patriotic military and civilians have continued to take the initiative in striking the enemy, expanding the tremendous achievements of the dry season, and launching a competition to kill the enemy. They bravely counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations, achieving brilliant victories. According to incomplete statistics, in the first three months of the rainy season, the local forces and guerrilla units of Laos annihilated more than a thousand enemy soldiers and shot down several enemy aircraft. The local forces and people of Luang Prabang Province annihilated nearly 200 enemy soldiers in the first three months of the rainy season. The local forces and guerrilla units of Xam Neua Province annihilated more than 200 enemy soldiers in July and August. The local forces and guerrilla units of Phongsali Province annihilated nearly 300 enemy soldiers in the first three months of the rainy season. The local forces and guerrilla units of other provinces also annihilated a large number of enemy soldiers.

The broadcast said that these victories have caused the military plots of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs to "eat into" the liberated areas to suffer a shameful failure. It shows that the local forces and guerrilla units of Laos are increasingly developing and growing stronger. Not only can the main forces annihilate and consume the enemy's combat effectiveness, but the local forces and guerrilla units can also fight independently, annihilating and consuming the enemy's combat effectiveness. The broadcast finally called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to advance bravely, achieve greater victories, and excellently implement the rainy season combat plan of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee and the Lao People's Liberation Army General Headquarters, in order to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of Lao independence and welcome the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

    老挝爱国军民乘胜前进扩大战果
    雨季头三个月英勇反击敌人“扫荡”共歼灭敌人一千多名
    新华社康开七日电据巴特寮电台广播，老挝地方部队和民兵游击队在雨季头三个月中，取得了歼敌一千多名的辉煌胜利。
    广播说，进入雨季后，老挝爱国军民发扬连续打击敌人的主动优势，扩大旱季所取得的巨大战果，展开杀敌竞赛，英勇反击敌人的“扫荡”，取得辉煌胜利。据不完全统计，在雨季头三个月里，老挝地方部队和民兵游击队共歼敌一千多名，击落敌机多架。琅勃拉邦省地方部队和人民在雨季头三个月里歼敌近二百名。桑怒省地方部队和民兵游击队七月份和八月份歼敌二百多名。丰沙里省地方部队和游击队在雨季头三个月里歼敌近三百名。其它各省的地方部队和游击队也歼灭了大批敌人。
    广播说，这些胜利使得美帝国主义及其走狗“蚕食”进攻解放区的军事阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。它表明老挝地方部队和游击队日益发展壮大。不但主力部队可以歼灭和消耗敌人有生力量，地方部队和民兵游击队也同样可以独立作战，歼灭和消耗敌人有生力量。广播最后号召老挝爱国军民奋勇前进，夺取更大的胜利，出色地实现老挝爱国战线党中央和老挝人民解放军最高指挥部的雨季战斗计划，以便向老挝独立二十三周年献礼和迎接人民解放军建军二十周年。
