Revolutionary criticism is the powerful driving force behind struggle, criticism, and reform. Only through thorough criticism can there be thorough reform. The entire process of struggle, criticism, and reform cannot do without thorough criticism.

To carry out revolutionary criticism well is a strategic measure to eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. We must carry out thorough criticism deeply and persistently.

However, some comrades do not fully understand the importance of thorough criticism. They say, "We have carried out thorough criticism for more than a year, and it is almost finished." This is the thought of "revolution to the end," and it is also a manifestation that the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the extinction of class struggle has not been eliminated. Is it really "almost finished"?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm in our country, as to who will win, will take a fairly long time to resolve." As long as this class struggle continues, revolutionary criticism must continue. We must not stop and start again, or work for three days and rest for two. If we relax our thorough criticism, the class enemies will become active, and the old ideas and habits of the exploiting class will resurface. We must insist on criticizing every day, every month, and every year, to thoroughly criticize and expose the bourgeoisie and to completely uproot the poison of revisionism!

Revolutionary criticism is a process of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests. The deeper the criticism, the more it touches upon the thoughts of each individual. Everyone must put themselves in the criticism, especially some leading cadres, who should set an example and take the lead in criticizing private interests and revisionism, and deeply touch their souls. Only in this way can we inspire the masses, mobilize the masses, and have everyone join the battle of revolutionary criticism, fighting a "people's war."

Some people say, "It doesn't matter whether we criticize or not, as long as we reform." This thought of "secretly" reforming is actually a deserter of thorough criticism. Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution." "Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Reforming without criticizing is like weeding without uprooting, leaving endless trouble. Such reform is not thorough and not good. Without criticism, the two lines and two roads are not clear. Only by criticizing deeply and thoroughly can we distinguish what is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, what is the revisionist line, what is socialism, and what is capitalism. Thorough criticism is the driving force for thorough reform, and thorough reform is the result of thorough criticism. Our practical experience is to learn a segment of Chairman Mao's instructions, criticize a reactionary fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, expose a crime of a local capitalist-roader, and determine a reform measure. In this way, the struggle has a target, the criticism has a target, the reform has a direction, and by criticizing and reforming at the same time, we can achieve immediate results.

"Navigating the ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." To carry out revolutionary criticism seriously, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, not to rely on eloquence or high cultural level. We have a heart that is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. When we step onto the battlefield of thorough criticism, every word and sentence is like wielding our big hoes, hoeing and weeding on the black hearts of the Chinese Khrushchev, and hoeing and weeding on the poisonous roots of revisionism, ensuring that our country remains unchanged for thousands of years.

### 大批才能大改

    大批才能大改
    革命大批判是斗、批、改的强大动力。只有大批，才能大改。整个斗、批、改，都离不开大批判。
    搞好革命大批判，是肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义流毒的战略措施，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的百年大计。我们一定要把大批判深入、持久地开展下去。
    可是，有些同志，对大批判的重要意义认识不足。说什么“大批判搞了一年多，批得差不多了。”这是“革命到头”的思想，也是中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒没有肃清的表现。难道真的“差不多”了吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”只要这场阶级斗争还在进行，革命大批判就一定要继续下去，决不能批批停停，三天打鱼，两天晒网。放松了大批判，阶级敌人就会拚命活动，剥削阶级的旧思想、旧习惯就要回潮。我们要坚持天天批、月月批、年年批，把资产阶级批倒批臭，把修正主义的毒根彻底铲掉！
    革命大批判是破私立公的过程，大批判越深入，越是要触及每个人的思想。每个人都要在大批判中把自己摆进去，特别是一些领导干部，更应该以身作则，带头斗私批修，狠触灵魂。只有这样，才能启发群众，带动群众，人人上阵，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”。
    还有些人说，“批不批关系不大，改了就行。”这种“偷偷”改的思想，实际上是大批判的“逃兵”。毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”“破字当头，立也就在其中了。”光改不批，等于铲草留根，后患无穷。那种改，是改不彻底，改不好的。不批，两条路线分不明，两条道路看不清。只有批深批透，才能分清什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是修正主义的路线，什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义。大批是大改的动力，大改是大批的结果，大批才能大改。我们的实践经验，就是学一段毛主席的指示，批一个中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，诉一桩当地走资派的罪恶，定一条整改的措施。这样，斗有目标，批有靶子，改有方向，边批边改，就能收到立竿见影的效果。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”认真搞好革命大批判，最根本的就是要活学活用毛泽东思想，而不是靠什么能说会道、文化水平高。我们有了一颗无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，走上大批判的战场，字字句句就象挥动我们的大锄一样，锄锄挖在中国赫鲁晓夫的黑心上，锄锄铲到修正主义的毒根上，保证我们的国家千秋万代永不变色。
