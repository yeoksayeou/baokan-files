The Indian reactionary government brazenly announced a ban on approximately four million government employees across India who were planning to strike on the 19th. This fascist decree has met with strong resistance from government employees nationwide.

According to reports from Indian newspapers, various labor organizations have issued statements strongly condemning the Indian reactionary government's repressive measures. They declared, "Such brutal actions can only strengthen the resolve of government employees." The reports indicate that central government employees across the country will defy the Indian reactionary government's fascist repression and are determined to carry out a nationwide general strike.

The Indian reactionary government is terrified of the impending strike by central government employees, which is set to be unprecedented in scale. The head of the Indian reactionary government, Indira Gandhi, personally intervened in so-called "negotiations" with the strike leaders, while simultaneously ordering government departments to take a hardline stance against the impending striking employees.

    印度反动政府悍然宣布禁止政府雇员罢工
    印职工组织强烈谴责反动政府的镇压措施
    据新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府十三日悍然宣布禁止大约四百万印度全国各地中央政府雇员准备在十九日举行罢工的法西斯法令后，遭到印度各地政府雇员的强烈反抗。
    据印度报纸报道，许多职工组织纷纷发表声明，强烈谴责印度反动政府的镇压措施，他们表示，“这种残酷的措施，只能加强政府雇员的决心”。报道说，来自印度全国各地的消息表明，中央政府雇员将不顾印度反动政府的法西斯镇压，决心举行全国性总罢工。
    印度反动政府对这次中央政府雇员将要举行的空前规模的罢工斗争怕得要死。印度反动政府头子英迪拉·甘地一面亲自出马，与罢工领导人进行所谓“谈判”，一面却指令政府各部门采取强硬手段对付即将罢工的政府雇员。
