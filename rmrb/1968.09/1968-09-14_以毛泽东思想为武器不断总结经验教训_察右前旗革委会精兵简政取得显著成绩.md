The Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, gone through twists and turns and repeated efforts in the process of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, continuously summarizing experience and drawing lessons, and achieved remarkable results.

On December 13 of last year, after the Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner was established, initial reforms were made regarding the establishment of departments and the staffing of personnel. At that time, the Revolutionary Committee had two departments and eight groups (offices), with 57 staff members. This basically changed the bureaucratic old face of the former Flag Committee and Flag People's Committee, which had complex structures, excessive personnel, and severe detachment from the masses, and began to show a new revolutionary style distinct from the old organs.

The newly established revolutionary organs have a sharp and complex struggle with the old ideas, old concepts, old styles, and old frameworks of the exploiting classes. The struggle is extremely sharp and complex. Chairman Mao once pointed out when talking about streamlining and reducing bureaucracy: "The status quo and habits often bind people's minds tightly, even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape from this." When the Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner was first established, although the organization was streamlined and the staffing was reduced, many comrades did not fully understand the great political significance of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. Many departments could not break free from the old organizational framework, spending all day entangled in trivial matters, unable to deeply engage with the grassroots, and mobilize the masses to solve problems. When encountering difficulties, they could not push the work forward and demanded an increase in organizations and personnel. At that time, the leading comrades of the Flag Revolutionary Committee, influenced by the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the construction of political power, also could not withstand it. As a result, the organizational structure of the Flag Revolutionary Committee became bloated and cumbersome again, and the number of staff members increased from the initial 57 to 102 by the end of March this year, but the work was not done as well as before. This situation was increasingly incompatible with the thriving revolutionary new situation. Comrades at the grassroots level had many opinions, and the broad revolutionary masses also criticized, saying: "How did you do it? It's so troublesome to handle a matter."

The reflections from the grassroots and the criticisms from the masses aroused great concern from the Revolutionary Committee. They reviewed the changes over the past few months and gradually realized that the reform of the office work, adopting the previous simple organizational streamlining, was obviously not feasible. Just at this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest directive: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative organizations, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is linked to the masses." After hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner immediately conveyed it to all grassroots units and 200,000 revolutionary masses throughout the banner, and convened a full committee meeting to study and discuss throughout the night.

To implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, thought must lead the way. Thought leading the way is Mao Zedong Thought leading the way. Chairman Mao's latest directive, once learned and applied well, truly implemented, streamlining and reducing bureaucracy can be done well. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner, in learning and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive, linked it with the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders in the former Flag Committee and Flag People's Committee in the construction of political power, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, deeply exposed the evil plots of a handful of capitalist roaders and their agents in the past to restore capitalism with a cumbersome organization. The more they studied, the clearer their thoughts became, the more they talked, the brighter their hearts became, the more they criticized, the more they hated China's Khrushchev and his agents, and the more they compared, the more they saw the harm of the cumbersome old organization and the benefits of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. Through learning, discussion, criticism, comparison, mutual inspiration, and mutual improvement, the committee members unanimously recognized: Implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is not just a matter of streamlining some organizations and personnel; it is a serious class struggle. Building a streamlined and reduced bureaucracy revolutionary leadership organization that is linked to the masses is a fundamental measure to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism, an absolute necessity to consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary committees, and a matter of what flag to raise, what path to take, what line to implement, what kind of leadership team to organize, and what kind of political power to establish.

Matter becomes spirit, and spirit becomes matter. After Chairman Mao's latest directive was implemented in thought, it immediately became the conscious revolutionary action of the broad cadres and masses. "Chairman Mao instructs me to follow, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I move forward." The Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly made the decision to implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. They mobilized the masses, based on the actual situation and the needs of the grassroots, streamlined the original office organizations into two departments, with five groups and one office, and reduced the number of staff to 38.

Recently, the Revolutionary Committee of Chahar Right Front Banner seriously and humbly learned from the advanced units such as Lingbao County on the good thoughts, good experiences, and good methods of implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and decided to more bravely jump out of the old organizational framework, and further do a good job in streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

Shenyang Military Region's active learner and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, the head of the Revolutionary Committee of Fushun Cement Factory, Comrade Yu Zengliang, humbly learns from the working class, always appears in the posture of an ordinary laborer, and together with revolutionary workers, studies Chairman Mao's works, works together, struggles against selfishness and criticizes revisionism, promoting the revolutionization of thought. This is him working with the loading and unloading workers.

### 以毛泽东思想为武器不断总结经验教训  察右前旗革委会精兵简政取得显著成绩

    以毛泽东思想为武器不断总结经验教训
    察右前旗革委会精兵简政取得显著成绩
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区察哈尔右翼前旗革命委员会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在精兵简政过程中，经过曲折和反复，不断总结经验，吸取教训，做出了显著的成绩。
    去年十二月十三日，察右前旗革命委员会成立以后，对机构的设置和办事人员的编制，曾经进行了初步的改革。当时，革委会下设两部八组（室），办事人员五十七人，基本上改变了旧旗委、旗人委机构庞杂、人浮于事、严重脱离群众的官僚主义旧面貌，开始表现出三结合的革命机构与旧机关截然不同的革命新作风。
    新生的革命机构，同剥削阶级的旧思想、旧观念、旧作风、旧框框，存在着尖锐的矛盾。斗争是十分尖锐、十分复杂的。毛主席在谈到精兵简政时曾经指出：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”察右前旗革命委员会刚成立时，虽然精简了机构，缩小了编制，但是，不少同志对精兵简政的重大政治意义认识不足。好些部门跳不出原来旧机构的圈子，整天缠在事务堆里，不能扎扎实实地深入基层，放手发动群众去解决问题。一遇到困难，工作推不动，他们就要求增加机构和人员。当时，旗革委会的领导同志，由于受中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面反革命修正主义路线流毒的影响，也没有顶得住。结果，旗革委会的办事机构又重新庞杂臃肿起来，办事人员，从开始编制时的五十七人，到今年三月底，逐渐增加到了一百零二人，但工作却做得不如开始好了。这种状况，与蓬勃发展的革命新形势，越来越不适应。在基层工作的同志意见很大，广大革命群众也批评说：你们怎么搞的，办件事情那么麻烦。
    基层的反映，群众的批评，引起了革委会极大的重视。他们回顾几个月来的变化，逐渐认识到，机关工作的改革，采取以前那种单纯的组织精简，显然是行不通的。正在这时，毛主席发出最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”察右前旗革委会的委员们听到毛主席的这一最新指示后，立即向全旗各基层单位和二十万革命群众进行了传达，并召开全体委员会议，通夜进行学习、讨论。
    实行精兵简政，必须思想先行。思想先行，就是毛泽东思想领先。毛主席的最新指示学好了，用好了，真正落实了，精兵简政才能搞好。察右前旗革委会的成员，在学习落实毛主席的最新指示时，联系旧旗委、旗人委一小撮走资派在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义罪行，深入开展革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，深揭党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人过去搞的那一套庞杂的机构，妄图为资本主义复辟服务的罪恶阴谋。大家越学思想越明确，越谈心里越亮堂，越批对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人越仇恨，越比对庞杂的旧机构的危害和精兵简政的好处看得越清楚。委员们通过学习，讨论，批判，对比，互相启发，互相提高，一致认识到：实行精兵简政，决不仅仅是精简一些机构和人员的问题，是严肃的阶级斗争。建设一个精兵简政的革命化的联系群众的领导机构，是强化无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的根本措施，是巩固和发展新生的革命委员会的绝对需要，是关系到我们新生的革命委员会举什么旗，走什么路，执行什么路线，组织什么样的领导班子，建立什么性质政权的问题。
    物质变精神，精神变物质。毛主席的最新指示，在思想上落实以后，立即变成了广大干部和群众自觉的革命行动。“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”察右前旗革命委员会无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，很快作出了实行精兵简政的决定。他们放手发动群众，根据实际情况和基层需要，把原来的办事机构精简为两部，下设五组一室，办事人员精简到三十八人。
    不久前，察右前旗革命委员会认真地虚心地学习了灵宝县等先进单位实行精兵简政的好思想、好经验、好办法，决心更勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，进一步做好精兵简政工作。
  沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、抚顺水泥厂革委会主任于增良同志虚心向工人阶级学习，处处以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和革命工人一起，共同学习毛主席著作，共同劳动，共同斗私批修，促进了思想革命化。这是他和装卸工人在一起劳动。
