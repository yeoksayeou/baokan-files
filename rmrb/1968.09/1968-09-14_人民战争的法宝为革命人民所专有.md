Revolutionary war is a war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war.

The treasure of people's war belongs to the revolutionary people.

Li Dianbing, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinle County, Hebei Province, and a hero of the War of Resistance Against Japan

The revolutionary armed forces of the Indonesian people are waging guerrilla warfare in various parts of Indonesia, making the Indonesian reactionaries cry out in pain. War educates the people. The Indonesian revolutionary armed forces have summarized their experiences in battle and continuously created new strategies and tactics. War also teaches the enemy. After suffering defeats, the Indonesian reactionaries have racked their brains to find ways to counter the guerrillas. It is said that Suharto and his ilk want to "study" guerrilla warfare and have their reactionary troops undergo "special training" in "anti-guerrilla warfare," hoping to find a lifeline. This is truly a waste of effort!

A few years ago, it was said that the late U.S. President Kennedy had a copy of the works of our great leader Chairman Mao on his desk, trying to fathom the secrets of people's war. He devised a set of "anti-guerrilla warfare" strategies and tactics and chose South Vietnam as his "experimental field." The result was far from satisfactory. Now, the Indonesian reactionaries want to follow their American masters and learn from them. How ridiculous and tragic!

All reactionaries always think they are very clever, but in fact, they do nothing but foolish things. Remember when the Japanese devils in the North China Liberation Zone carried out "sweeps," implementing tactics like "iron wall encirclement, surprise attacks, horizontal and vertical sweeps, and reverse electric shocks," and implementing the "three-all" policy of burning, killing, and looting, and the "concentrated villages" policy of driving peasants into "human circles." All these so-called "anti-guerrilla tactics" of the Japanese devils did not save their lives.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our strategies and tactics are based on the foundation of people's war. Any anti-people army cannot use our strategies and tactics." This is an absolute truth.

People's war is carried out by the broad masses of the people. Only by mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses can we use the strategies and tactics of people's war to defeat the enemy. Once the masses are mobilized, they will set a trap for the enemy, making them unable to move a step, seeing enemies everywhere. At the same time, our own people's army will be like fish in water, flexible and free, striking when we want to strike, retreating when we want to retreat, making the enemy unable to cope.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was the commander of a guerrilla unit. Although our unit was small, the Japanese devils were terrified of us. No wonder, we were all from the same villages, familiar with the people and the land. The villagers often stood guard for us, sent messages, and gave us advice. We often launched surprise attacks on the enemy, striking and then retreating; when we encountered small enemy forces, we would swallow them whole. The Japanese devils came looking for us but couldn't find a trace. Once, I disguised myself as a pilgrim and killed a Japanese officer. The man was dead, but the Japanese didn't know how he had died.

Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, we waged guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the areas of Quyang and Fuping. To eliminate the Japanese bandits, we created a new fighting method called the "sparrow warfare." We also combined sparrow warfare, explosive warfare, village warfare, and tunnel warfare, appearing and disappearing like ghosts, making the Japanese devils stare in amazement.

The treasure of guerrilla warfare can only be used by revolutionary people; reactionaries will never be able to learn it, let alone use it. Because they are anti-people, they are invaders, exploiters, and oppressors. Wherever the reactionary army goes, it will never gain the support of the masses and will always be surrounded by the people, always passive, always taking blows. The nature of the reactionaries determines that they cannot formulate correct strategies and tactics. Their initial advantages are only superficial and temporary phenomena; they will inevitably turn into disadvantages until they are ultimately eliminated. The Indonesian people's revolutionary guerrilla warfare will definitely defeat the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime's counter-revolutionary "anti-guerrilla warfare."

Now, the revolutionary situation in Indonesia is excellent. The revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan and East Java have continuously taken the initiative to launch attacks and fought bravely, growing stronger in the struggle. Recently, I read in the newspapers that the revolutionary armed forces in some areas of East Java have begun to use tunnel warfare to strike the enemy. This is a new development in the Indonesian people's guerrilla warfare. The struggle is long-term and the road is tortuous. However, I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people will persist in armed struggle and will definitely achieve the final victory.

### 人民战争的法宝为革命人民所专有

    革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。
    人民战争的法宝为革命人民所专有
    河北省新乐县革委会主任、抗日战争战斗英雄　李殿冰
    印度尼西亚人民革命武装力量在印尼各处开展游击战争，打得印尼反动派叫苦连天。战争教育了人民。印尼人民革命武装在战斗中总结经验，不断创造新的战略战术。战争也教训了敌人。印尼反动派吃了败仗之后，挖空心思寻找对付的办法。据说，苏哈托之流要“研究”游击战，并且让他们手下的反动军队进行“反游击战”的“特别训练”，打算捞根救命草。这真是瞎子点灯白费蜡！
    几年前，听说已经死了的那个美国总统肯尼迪书桌上放着我们伟大领袖毛主席的著作，想捉摸人民战争的奥妙。他搞了一套“反游击战”的战略战术，还选了越南南方作“试验场”。结果一点也不灵光。印尼反动派现在也要学它美国主子的样，岂不是可笑而又可悲！
    一切反动派总是以为自己很高明，其实干的尽是蠢事。想当年，日本鬼子在华北解放区对我们进行“扫荡”，大搞什么“铁壁合围，扑捉奇袭，纵横扫荡，反转电击”，还实行烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”和把农民赶进“人圈”的“集家并村”等等。日本鬼子所有这些所谓“反游击战术”，并没有能够救他们的命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的战略战术是建立在人民战争这个基础上的，任何反人民的军队都不能利用我们的战略战术。”这是千真万确的真理。
    人民战争是靠广大人民来进行的。只有动员群众、依靠群众，才能运用人民战争的战略战术，战胜敌人。只要人民群众发动起来，就给敌人布下了天罗地网，使他们寸步难行，草木皆兵。同时我们人民自己的军队，也就可以象鱼儿在水里一样，灵活自如，说打就打，说走就走，叫敌人无法对付。
    抗日战争时期，我是一支游击队的队长。我们这支队伍，人数虽然不多，日本鬼子却怕得要命。也难怪，我们都是从各个村子里来的，本乡本土，人熟地熟，乡亲们经常给我们放哨站岗，通风报信，提建议，出主意。我们常常出其不意地袭击敌人，干一家伙就跑；碰上小股敌人，就一口把它吃掉。日本鬼子来找我们，连个影子也找不着。有一趟，我化装赶庙，打死了一个鬼子军官。人死了，鬼子还不知道是怎么丢命的。
    我们根据毛主席的教导，在曲阳、阜平一带开展敌后抗日游击战争。为了消灭日本强盗，大伙创造了一套新打法——“麻雀战”。我们还把麻雀战、爆炸战、村落战、地道战连成一体，神出鬼没，打得鬼子干瞪眼。
    游击战争这个法宝只有革命人民能运用，反动派是永远也学不到手，永远也使用不了的。因为他们反人民，他们是侵略者，剥削者，压迫者。反动军队无论开到那里，总是得不到群众的支持，处在人民群众的包围之中，处处被动，处处挨打。反动派的本质决定了它不能制订正确的战略战术。他们开头的优势，不过是表面的暂时现象，它总要转化成劣势，直到最后被消灭。印尼人民革命的游击战，一定要打败苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权反革命的“反游击战”。
    现在，印尼人民革命形势一片大好。西加里曼丹和东爪哇等地区的人民革命武装连续主动出击，英勇作战，在斗争中不断壮大自己的力量。近来看报，知道东爪哇一些地区的人民革命武装开始采用地道战来打击敌人。这是印尼人民游击战争的新发展。斗争是长期的，道路是曲折的。但是，我坚决相信，印尼人民在印尼共产党的正确领导下，坚持武装斗争，一定可以取得最后的胜利。
