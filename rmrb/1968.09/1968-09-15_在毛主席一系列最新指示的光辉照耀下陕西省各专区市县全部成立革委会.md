Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all eight prefectures, three cities, and ninety-three counties of Shaanxi Province. Revolutionary committees have also been established in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and in the vast majority of rural people's communes. Currently, a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging across the entire province.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses of Shaanxi have raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an cultivated by Chairman Mao, and waged a heroic struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northwest China and Shaanxi. They have won victory after victory and established the provincial revolutionary committee on May 1st. However, "all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will make desperate struggles against the revolutionary forces." A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have, in the face of the increasingly favorable situation of the Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi, secretly plotted and schemed, incited the masses to fight the masses, created counter-revolutionary incidents, and sabotaged revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. At this critical moment of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the Proletarian Headquarters, with Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin at the core, issued extremely wise instructions to the revolutionary people of Shaanxi. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionaries in Shaanxi have resolutely carried out the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and resolutely criticized the reactionary bourgeois theory of "multiple centers means no center," as well as manifestations of bourgeois worldviews such as sectarianism, factionalism, and small-groupism. Through fierce class struggles, the revolutionary spirit of the people has been greatly enhanced, and the desperate struggles of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northwest China and Shaanxi, along with a handful of class enemies, have been thoroughly smashed. The revolutionary situation has been further consolidated and developed, and revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination have emerged in succession at all levels.

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work." The working class of Shaanxi, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has played a leading role in developing the favorable situation of the Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi. In recent months, revolutionary workers in all factories, mines, and construction sites across the province have set up tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, and deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly cleaned up class ranks, and streamlined organizations. In the process of these tasks, the working class has set a good example for the entire province. For example, the experience of achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination created by the workers of Weibei Coal Mine, and the experience of combining revolutionary criticism with the cleaning up of class ranks created by the workers of Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory, among others, have greatly promoted the development of the favorable situation of the Cultural Revolution in all sectors of the province. At the same time, the broad revolutionary workers of the entire province, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, poor and lower-middle peasants, and cadre officials, have formed more than 300,000 people in over 10,000 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, conveying and explaining Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters with Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin at the core to the broad revolutionary masses across the province. This has greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses, firmly, accurately, and fiercely struck at a handful of hidden class enemies, and greatly strengthened proletarian dictatorship.

After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "to achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership by the working class, and workers must participate, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to form a three-in-one combination with the students, teachers, and workers in schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools," the first batch of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the province, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, have entered schools and units that have not done a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation, leading and helping with the Cultural Revolution and all work there. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the Xi'an region entered twenty-eight units that had not achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, they raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, conducted thorough and detailed ideological and political work, and effectively promoted revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in these units.

"Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The broad officers and soldiers of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Region and the stationed troops of the People's Liberation Army have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to, organize, and arm the masses. The broad officers and soldiers have insisted on the four-firsts, carried forward the three-eighths spirit, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses, fiercely striking at the sabotage activities of class enemies and establishing new merits for the people.

The revolutionary upsurge has brought about a production upsurge in industry and agriculture across the province. Currently, industrial production has surged significantly, and the coal production level has created a record unparalleled in history. Railway transportation is smooth and uninterrupted, and transportation tasks are being completed better and better. Many factories, mines, and enterprises have seen a vigorous technological revolution. After the summer harvest of agricultural crops, the province has overcome drought, and the autumn crops in most areas are growing well.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下
    陕西省各专区市县全部成立革委会
    国营工矿企业和绝大部分农村人民公社也成立了革委会。目前，一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮正在全省范围内兴起
    新华社西安十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，陕西省革命形势空前大好，越来越好。全省八个专区、三个市和九十三个县，全部成立了革命委员会。全省国营工矿企业和绝大部分农村人民公社也成立了革命委员会。目前，在全省范围内，一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮正在兴起。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，陕西的工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，发扬毛主席培育的延安革命精神，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北、陕西的代理人进行了英勇的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利，于今年五月一日建立了省革命委员会。但是，“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在陕西文化大革命形势越来越好的情况下，暗地里施展阴谋诡计，挑动群众斗群众，制造反革命事件，破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，破坏斗、批、改。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线进行激烈斗争的时刻，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部给陕西革命人民发出了极其英明的指示。陕西的广大工人、贫下中农和革命群众，在省革委会的带领下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，并且坚决批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，批判了宗派主义、山头主义、小团体主义等资产阶级世界观的各种表现。通过激烈的阶级斗争，大长了革命人民的志气，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北、陕西的代理人等一小撮阶级敌人进行垂死挣扎的阴谋，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大好形势，各级三结合的革命委员会联翩出现。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”陕西工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在发展陕西省文化大革命的大好形势中，发挥了领导作用。最近几个月来，全省各工厂、矿山、工地的革命工人，共开办了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，积极建立三结合的革命委员会，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大力进行清理阶级队伍、精简机构等项工作。在进行这些工作的过程中，工人阶级为全省树立了好榜样。例如，渭北煤矿工人创造的实现革命大联合和革命三结合的经验，秦川机床厂工人创造的把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来的经验，等等，对全省各行各业发展文化大革命的大好形势，起了很大的推动作用。同时，全省的广大革命工人还和解放军战士、贫下中农、机关干部一起，组成有三十万人参加的一万多个毛泽东思想宣传队，向全省广大革命群众传达和宣讲毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，极大地提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，大大加强了无产阶级专政。
    毛主席发出“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校”的最新指示以后，在省革委会领导下，全省第一批工人毛泽东思想宣传队，已经开进学校和没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，领导和帮助那里的文化大革命和一切工作。西安地区工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻二十八个原来没有实现革命大联合和革命三结合的单位以后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入细致地进行思想政治工作，有效地促进了这些单位的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军陕西省军区和驻军广大指战员，坚决执行毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众。广大指战员坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，同广大革命群众并肩战斗，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动，为人民建立了新的功勋。
    革命的高潮带来了全省工农业生产的高潮。目前，全省工业生产大幅度上升，煤炭生产水平创造了历史上从来没有过的纪录。铁路交通运输畅通无阻，运输任务完成得越来越好。不少厂矿企业出现了蓬勃发展的技术革命热潮。全省农业生产继夏收作物获得大丰收之后，又战胜了干旱，大部分地区秋季作物长势良好。
