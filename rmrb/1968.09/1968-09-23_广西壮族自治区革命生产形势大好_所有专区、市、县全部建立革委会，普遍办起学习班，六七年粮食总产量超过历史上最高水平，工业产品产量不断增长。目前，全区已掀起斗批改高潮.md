The working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, closely following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war." They are vigorously pushing forward the revolution and vigorously promoting production, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent and getting better.

At present, all eight special districts, four municipalities directly under the province, and 82 counties (cities) in the entire autonomous region have established revolutionary committees. The Liuzhou Railway Bureau and its subordinate divisions have all established revolutionary committees. Most factories, mines, people's communes, shops, offices, and schools in the region have also established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. The city and countryside have further carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering the entire region. According to incomplete statistics, the region has held over 460,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 17.54 million participants.

In agricultural production, the total grain output of the entire autonomous region in 1967 exceeded the highest level in history. In the first half of this year, despite the sabotage by a handful of class enemies and natural disasters in some areas, the various levels of revolutionary committees have firmly grasped class struggle and the ideological transformation of people, achieving a bumper harvest. On the industrial front, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have taken up the dual burdens of revolution and production with a fighting posture, overcoming the difficulties caused by the temporary disruption of transportation and supply of raw materials by class enemies, and increasing the production of coal, sugar, diesel engines, phosphate fertilizer, threshers, printing paper, printing equipment, refined aluminum products, walk-behind tractors, diesel generator sets, and canned food to varying degrees. The region's sugar production this year has increased by 20% compared to the last sugar season, making it the year with the highest sugar production in Guangxi's history.

At present, the entire region is vigorously promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, launching a great new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform.

    广西壮族自治区革命生产形势大好
    所有专区、市、县全部建立革委会，普遍办起学习班，六七年粮食总产量超过历史上最高水平，工业产品产量不断增长。目前，全区已掀起斗批改高潮
    据新华社南宁二十二日电　广西壮族自治区的工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    现在，全自治区的八个专区、四个省辖市和八十二个县（市）全部都建立了革命委员会。柳州铁路管理局和所属各个分局，全部成立了革命委员会。全区的工厂、矿山、人民公社、商店、机关和学校，也绝大部分成立了革命委员会或革命领导小组。城乡进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍布全区。据不完全统计，全区各地先后开办的毛泽东思想学习班，达四十六万多期，参加学习的人数有一千七百五十四万多人次。
    在农业生产上，一九六七年全自治区粮食总产量超过了历史上的最高水平。今年上半年，农业生产尽管受到一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和局部地区发生了自然灾害，由于各级革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争和人的思想革命化，仍然夺得了丰收。在工业战线上，广大革命职工以战斗的姿态，挑起了革命与生产两副重担，克服了阶级敌人一度破坏交通运输造成的某些原材料供应不足的困难，使全区煤炭、机制糖、柴油机、磷肥、打谷机、机印纸、印刷设备、精制铝品、手扶拖拉机、柴油发电机组及罐头食品等产品的产量，都有不同程度的增长。全区机制糖本年度比上年度榨季产量增长百分之二十，是广西历史上产糖量最多的一年。
    目前，全区正在大力宣传、落实毛主席最近发出的一系列最新指示，掀起了伟大的斗、批、改新高潮。
