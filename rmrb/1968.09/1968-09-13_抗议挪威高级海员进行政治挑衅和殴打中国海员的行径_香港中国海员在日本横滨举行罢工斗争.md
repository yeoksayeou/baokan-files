Hong Kong Chinese sailors in Yokohama, Japan, stage a strike struggle

Yokohama and Tokyo patriotic overseas Chinese, and sailors on the Chinese cargo ship "Liaoyuan" docked in Yokohama fully support the just struggle of Chinese sailors.

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: According to a report from the East Asian News Agency, Chinese patriotic sailors from Hong Kong on the Norwegian cargo ship "Japana" recently went on strike in Yokohama, Japan, to protest against the political provocations and assaults by Norwegian senior crew members on Chinese sailors.

The Norwegian senior crew members on the "Japana" cargo ship have always subjected Chinese sailors to various forms of persecution and cruel exploitation.

The Chinese sailors have an unlimited love for their motherland and for the great leader Chairman Mao. They have organized study classes and have been continuously studying Mao Zedong Thought.

On August 4th, when the "Japana" cargo ship was docked in Yokohama, Chinese sailor Li Zhencha was studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" there. A Norwegian second mate snatched the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from Li Zhencha and ruthlessly threw this red treasure book into the sea. Li Zhencha, with his unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, immediately joined other Chinese sailors in strongly protesting to the Norwegian second mate. However, this second mate not only did not admit his crime but, on September 4th, together with another Norwegian sailor, suddenly attacked Li Zhencha and another Chinese sailor, brutally beating them.

Li Zhencha and other patriotic Chinese sailors on September 6th lodged a strong protest with the captain of the "Japana" cargo ship and the Norwegian consul in Yokohama, demanding that the two Norwegian assailants be ordered to leave the ship immediately, apologize to the injured and other Chinese sailors on the ship, and compensate for the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other items.

The captain and the Norwegian consul, although verbally agreeing to these demands, did not actually fulfill their promises. Instead, they continued to persecute the Chinese sailors. Therefore, on September 7th, 14 patriotic Chinese sailors went ashore and went on strike.

The patriotic overseas Chinese in Yokohama and Tokyo fully support the just struggle of the Chinese sailors. On September 9th, Chinese patriotic sailors held talks with the captain and the Norwegian consul. They severely condemned the reactionary Norwegian senior crew members for their contempt and persecution of Chinese sailors and their open political provocations.

The sailors on the Chinese cargo ship "Liaoyuan" docked in Yokohama unanimously expressed their full support for the patriotic just struggle of the Hong Kong Chinese sailors.

On the evening of September 9th, 130 patriotic overseas Chinese in Yokohama and individuals engaged in Japan-China friendship activities held a meeting to resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese sailors on the "Japana" cargo ship.

Under the resolute struggle of the Chinese sailors, the captain of the "Japana" cargo ship was forced to make the two Norwegian senior crew members who assaulted the Chinese sailors disembark and handed over a letter of apology to the Chinese sailors. This letter of apology did not satisfy the just demands of the Chinese sailors, and they refused to accept it.

A Chinese sailor said on September 9th: We have an unlimited love for our great motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao. We will not allow anyone to slander Chairman Mao or the Chinese people. During the struggle, we heard the great news that revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Taiwan. We are very happy and have been greatly inspired. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. We are determined to use great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to continue our struggle.

    抗议挪威高级海员进行政治挑衅和殴打中国海员的行径
    香港中国海员在日本横滨举行罢工斗争
    横滨和东京的爱国华侨、停泊在横滨的中国货船“燎原号”海员完全支持中国海员的正义斗争
    新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道，来自香港的挪威货船“贾帕纳号”上的中国爱国海员最近在日本横滨举行罢工，抗议船上的挪威高级海员向他们进行政治挑衅和殴打中国海员的行径。
      “贾帕纳号”货船上的挪威高级海员一向对中国海员进行各种迫害和残酷剥削。
    中国海员无限热爱祖国、热爱伟大领袖毛主席，他们组织了学习班，一直在学习毛泽东思想。
    八月四日，当“贾帕纳号”货船在横滨停泊时，中国海员李振洽正在那里学习《毛主席语录》，一个挪威的二副从李振洽那里抢走了《毛主席语录》，并悍然把这本红色宝书扔进了海中。李振洽对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，立即同其他中国海员一道向挪威的二副提出了强烈的抗议。然而这个二副不但不承认自己的罪行，反而在九月四日同另一个挪威海员一道对李振洽和另一个中国海员进行了突然袭击，野蛮殴打。
    李振洽和其他中国爱国海员在九月六日向“贾帕纳号”货船船长和挪威驻横滨领事提出了严厉的抗议，并要求他们命令行凶的两名挪威人立即离船，向受伤者和船上其他中国海员表示道歉并赔偿红色宝书《毛主席语录》等。
    船长和挪威领事虽然口头上答应这些要求，但是实际上并不履行他们的诺言，相反的，对中国海员继续进行迫害。因此，十四名中国爱国海员于九月七日上岸，举行罢工。
    横滨和东京的爱国华侨完全支持中国海员的正义斗争。九月九日，中国爱国海员同船长和挪威领事举行了会谈。他们严厉谴责反动的挪威高级海员蔑视和迫害中国海员以及公开进行政治挑衅的行动。
    停泊在横滨的中国货船“燎原号”的海员一致表示全力支持香港中国海员的爱国正义斗争。
    横滨爱国华侨和从事日中友好运动的人士一百三十多人，九日晚在横滨举行集会，坚决支持“贾帕纳号”货船的中国海员的正义斗争。
    在中国海员的坚决斗争下，“贾帕纳号”货船船长被迫让殴打中国海员的两个挪威高级海员下船，并把一封道歉信交给中国海员。这封道歉信不能满足中国海员的严正要求，他们拒绝接受。
    一位中国海员九日发表谈话说：我们无限热爱伟大的祖国和伟大的领袖毛主席。我们绝不容许任何人诬蔑毛主席，诬蔑中国人民。在斗争中间，我们听到了全国除台湾以外的省、市、自治区全部成立了革命委员会的巨大喜讯，我们感到非常高兴，受到了无限鼓舞。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。我们决心以伟大的毛泽东思想作为武器继续进行斗争。
