	Hotly responding to Chairman Mao's great call for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants, over 26,000 graduates from Beijing and Fujian are heading to the production front.

	The broad masses of graduates resolutely go to the countryside, to the border areas, to the factories and mines, and to the grassroots, learning from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They wholeheartedly serve the people and cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 10th, over 20,000 graduates from Beijing's colleges and universities in 1967 are currently heading to the production front of industry and agriculture, going to the countryside, to the border areas, to the factories and mines, and to the grassroots, following Chairman Mao's great teachings on the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants.

	Before leaving school, the broad masses of graduates from various colleges and universities in Beijing carried out extensive and in-depth criticism and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents, especially the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread in the issue of graduate allocation. They fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "public-private fusion," "reading books to become officials," and "suffering small losses to gain big advantages," raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, and become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Many colleges and universities, such as Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Workers-Peasants-Soldiers Institute of Physical Education, and Beijing Mining Institute, held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought for graduates. In these classes, the broad masses of graduates studied the "Three Articles," carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, invited old workers and poor peasants to give reports on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and some even dug wild vegetables and ate bitter meals to carry out various forms of class education. The broad masses of graduates deeply realized that going to the countryside, to the border areas, to the factories and mines, and to the grassroots to become ordinary workers and peasants and integrate with workers and peasants is a strategic measure to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Whether or not to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants is a major issue that tests a young person's loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary youth have seen the direction of advancement, each pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao and expressing their determination. Many graduates filled out their application forms without hesitation, writing: "Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance!" "Firmly obey the organization's allocation!" "Go to where the motherland needs you most!" "Go to the most arduous places!" Many schools saw moving deeds of graduates competing to go to the border areas and the most arduous places.

	Some schools that had not yet established revolutionary committees had their graduate allocation work directly managed by the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed at schools like Tsinghua University accepted the task of allocating graduates under the conditions of short time and heavy tasks. The worker comrades said, "We workers are allocating university graduates for the first time. This is a glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao. We must complete it well and allocate the graduates according to the needs of the proletarian revolutionary cause." They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, organized the broad masses of graduates to study Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, used their personal experiences to conduct class education for the graduates, guided them to criticize and struggle against private thoughts and revisionism, and criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, establishing the thought of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrating with them. Through the arduous and meticulous ideological work of the worker and PLA comrades, the problems in the graduate allocation work were solved in just a few days. Many graduates happily said, "The working class approved our graduation and personally allocated our work. This is the first time in history. We will definitely continue to accept tests in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment and cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Fuzhou dated the 10th, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and inspired by the great news of the country turning red, over 6,000 graduates from the 1966 and 1967 classes of colleges and universities in Fujian Province are resolutely responding to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants. They are heading to mountain areas and remote regions of farms and factories, determined to, under the leadership of the working class and the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, go to the remote regions of the motherland to plant red flowers and bear red fruits.

	The great news of the country turning red has greatly inspired the graduates of colleges and universities in Fujian Province. Many graduates allocated to the remote regions of the motherland have decided to, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," quickly rush to their work positions, learn from the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants there, and together with them seize the revolution and promote production, participating in the socialist construction of the great motherland.

	Before leaving school, the 1966 and 1967 classes of graduates from colleges and universities in Fujian Province universally held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. They fiercely struggled against the "private" character in their minds and firmly established the "public" character of the proletariat. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the revisionist goods of "public-private fusion," "going to the countryside for gilding," and "reading books to become officials." The revolutionary criticism and struggle further raised the class consciousness of the broad masses of graduates, deepening their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their intense hatred for China's Khrushchev. They resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "the final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually integrate with the workers and peasants." They go to the countryside, to the border areas, to the factories and mines, and to the grassroots, learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

    热烈响应毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的伟大号召
    首都福建两万六千多名大学毕业生奔向生产第一线
    广大毕业生坚决到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中向工人和贫下中农学习，全心全意地为人民服务，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人
    据新华社十日讯　首都大专院校一九六七届毕业生两万多人，遵循毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的伟大教导，目前正陆续奔向工农业生产第一线，到农村去、到边疆去、到工矿去、到基层去。
    首都各大专院校广大毕业生们在离校之前，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，特别是在毕业生分配问题上散布的反革命修正主义谬论，广泛深入地开展了革命的大批判。他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“公私溶化”论、“读书做官”论以及“吃小亏占大便宜”等反动谬论，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，表示坚决听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的与工农相结合的道路，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    北京农业大学、北京师范大学、北京工农兵体育学院、北京矿业学院等许多大专院校都举办了毕业生毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，广大毕业生大学大用“老三篇”，开展革命的大批判，请老工人、老贫农作忆苦思甜报告，有的还自己挖野菜，吃忆苦饭，开展各种形式的阶级教育。广大毕业生深刻认识到，到农村、到边疆、到工矿、到基层，去当普通工人、农民，与工农相结合，这是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的战略措施。走不走与工农相结合的道路，是考验一个青年对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线忠不忠的大问题。革命青年看清了前进的方向，个个向毛主席献忠心，表决心。许多毕业生在填志愿书时毫不犹豫地写上：“毛主席挥手我前进！”“坚决服从组织分配！”“到祖国最需要的地方去！”“到最艰苦的地方去！”不少学校出现了争着到边疆去、到最艰苦的地方去的动人事迹。
    一些还没有成立革命委员会的学校，工人毛泽东思想宣传队直接主持了毕业生的分配工作。驻清华大学等学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在时间短、任务重的情况下接受了分配毕业生的任务。工人同志说，我们工人第一次亲自分配大学毕业生，这是毛主席给我们的光荣任务，我们一定完成好，一定按照无产阶级革命事业的需要分配好毕业生。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，组织广大毕业生学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，用自己的亲身经历对毕业生进行阶级教育，引导他们斗私批修，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，树立为工农兵服务，与工农兵结合的思想。通过工人和解放军同志的艰苦细致的思想工作，毕业生分配工作中的问题在短短的几天里都得到了解决。许多毕业生高兴地说，工人阶级批准我们毕业、并且亲自分配我们的工作，这是有史以来第一次。我们一定在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中继续接受考验，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    据新华社福州十日电　在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在全国山河一片红的特大喜讯鼓舞下，福建省六千多名一九六六和一九六七年两届大专院校毕业生，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的伟大号召，纷纷奔赴山区和边远地区的农场、厂矿，决心在工人阶级的领导下，在贫下中农的教育下，到祖国边远地区去开红花，结红果。
    全国山河一片红这个振奋人心的喜讯，使福建省大专院校的毕业生受到了极大鼓舞。许多分配到祖国边远地区的毕业生，都决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速赶到自己工作岗位上去，向那里的工人、贫下中农学习，同他们一起抓革命，促生产，参加伟大祖国的社会主义建设。
    福建省大专院校一九六六和一九六七年两届毕业生在离校前夕，普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和毛主席一系列最新指示，狠斗头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线以及“大公有私”、“下乡镀金”、“读书做官”等修正主义黑货。革命的大批判，进一步提高了广大毕业生的阶级觉悟，加深了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。他们坚决遵循毛主席“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”的教导，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，向工人和贫下中农学习，走与工农相结合的道路。
