South Yemen newspapers have published editorials on the South Yemen People's Republic delegation's friendly visit to China, welcoming the development of friendly relations between South Yemen and China, and enthusiastically praising the significant impact of the Chinese revolution on the world revolution.

A New China News Agency dispatch from Aden on the 18th reported that South Yemen newspapers have published editorials on the South Yemen People's Republic delegation's friendly visit to China. They welcome the development of friendly relations between South Yemen and China and enthusiastically praise the significant impact of the Chinese revolution on the world revolution.

The editorial in the 17th issue of the weekly "Revolutionary" published by the South Yemen National Front said that the South Yemen delegation's visit to China and the great Chinese people is taking place at a time when the world revolutionary movement is continuously expanding and people oppressed by the enemy are uniting. This visit is taking place at a time when the world revolution is engaged in a tense struggle against imperialism led by the United States.

The editorial said that since the Chinese revolution overthrew the rule of feudalism and imperialism in China, the great struggle of the enslaved peoples has greatly weakened the colonial system. In this struggle, the role of the Chinese revolution is of historical significance. The Chinese revolution has achieved great results and victories, pushing the world revolutionary tide forward and turning colonialism into a paper tiger.

The editorial said that after a long struggle and construction for socialism, the great Chinese people have today become revolutionary allies in the struggle of oppressed peoples against imperialism and a living example for peoples who yearn for the most beautiful socialist society.

The editorial in the 16th issue of the "October Fourteenth Daily" said that the South Yemen delegation's visit will further affirm the battle ties between the South Yemen people and the great Chinese people against their common enemy.

The editorial pointed out that the South Yemen delegation's visit to China opens a new era in the historical relations between the South Yemen revolution led by the National Front and the Chinese revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong.

The editorial said that the great China, rich in revolutionary experience, has enriched progressive thought and influenced the thought of the world revolution.

The editorial also emphasized that the South Yemen revolution is a component of the world revolutionary movement. The South Yemen revolution, like revolutions in other parts of the world, is a struggle against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries.
