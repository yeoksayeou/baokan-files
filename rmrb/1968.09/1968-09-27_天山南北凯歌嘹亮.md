The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established. On that day, the 80-year-old Uygur old peasant from Hetian County's Red Flag Commune, Kurban Tulum, came from the Kunlun Mountains to Urumqi to participate in the celebration. The old man held up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," shouting "Yashia (Long live) Chairman Mao!" and danced and sang with the joyful crowd. Many comrades advised him, "You are old, take a break from dancing!" Kurban Tulum said, "Uygurs love to dance when they are happy. On this great day when the whole country is red, how can I not dance and sing to my heart's content!"

Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao had received this old peasant who had been a slave for over forty years. Chairman Mao's warm care made Kurban deeply moved. He decided to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. During the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Kurban has always followed Chairman Mao closely. Although he is in Hetian, his heart is in Beijing. Every morning after getting up, the first thing he does is to lead his entire family and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire village to study Chairman Mao's works. At every critical moment of class struggle, he always handles problems according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Last spring, a handful of class enemies in the Red Flag Commune stirred up a black wind, attempting to disrupt spring plowing and production. Kurban, with his deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, day and night ran around, linking up with class brothers who had deep hatred and bitterness, together studying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply exposing the class enemies' plot to restore capitalism. To ensure that everyone does not forget the bitterness of the old society and further heighten class struggle awareness, he also led everyone to visit the house he lived in and the things he used before liberation, and organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct "Remembering Bitterness and Tasting Sweetness" activities. Many poor and lower-middle peasant members shed tears of excitement, saying: The Uygur people have been liberated, and Chairman Mao's kindness will never be forgotten!

"Reading Chairman Mao's books, becoming younger and younger"

Wuqia County's Zhongdong Commune is located in the westernmost part of Xinjiang. Although far from Beijing, the hearts of the Korkiz people living here are closely connected with Chairman Mao. During the Cultural Revolution, the Korkiz people followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," and through study classes, pastures, fields, and homes, they held criticism meetings to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Xinjiang. At one criticism meeting, the 50-year-old old woman Batouma was very excited. She said, "Chinese Khrushchev said that capitalists and landlords' exploitation is beneficial, which is nonsense. In the old society, my family lived a life of hunger and cold, and my husband died of hard work as a long-term laborer for the 'Ba Yi.' Chinese Khrushchev wants us to go back to the old road, suffer again, which is a foolish dream."

The revolutionary criticism has raised the peasants' and herdsmen's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, further promoting the revolutionization of thought, and the lively scenes of everyone caring for the collective have continued to appear.

Although the old herdsman Tuergan is illiterate, he has a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. With the help of his son, he reads Chairman Mao's books every day and implements Chairman Mao's great teachings in his actions.

This spring, due to heavy snowfall, there was a cold snap, affecting the sheep. He thought: Sheep are the property of the state, and we must strengthen their care and not let them suffer any loss.

One day, the whole family studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Tuergan said to his wife and sons: The old man Qu was so old, but he still had the determination to lead his sons to remove the two big mountains in front of his door. Can we not take the spirit of the old man Qu and build a sheep pen for the sheep? As soon as he finished speaking, everyone unanimously agreed. The next day, the whole family of four went to work, going to a distant place to carry stones. After a few days of hard work, they finally built two sheep pens, ensuring the safety of more than 800 sheep. This year, the survival rate of the sheep he herded reached 98%, making it one of the highest survival rates in the entire commune. Someone caring said, "You are already over 60 years old, you should take care of your health!" He happily said, "After studying Chairman Mao's precious books, I feel younger and younger."

专栏：庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年

    天山南北凯歌嘹亮
    毛主席的恩情永不忘
    新疆维吾尔自治区革委会成立那天，于田县红旗公社的维吾尔族老贫农，八十多岁的库尔班·吐鲁木，为了庆祝这个大喜日子，他特意从昆仑山下赶来乌鲁木齐参加庆祝大会。这位老人手举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼“亚夏（万岁）！毛主席！”同欢乐的人群一起纵情歌舞！好多同志劝他：“你上了岁数了，少跳一会吧！”库尔班·吐鲁木说：“维吾尔人在高兴的时候是爱跳舞的，在这全国山河一片红的大喜日子里，叫我怎么能不尽情地跳舞歌唱！”
    十年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经接见过这位当过四十多年奴隶的老贫农。毛主席的亲切关怀，使库尔班激动万分，他决心永远忠于毛主席。在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，库尔班始终紧紧跟着毛主席。他人在于田，心向北京，每天起床后的第一件事，就是带领全家老少和全村贫下中农，学习毛主席著作。在每次阶级斗争的紧要关头，他总是按照毛主席的教导去处理问题。去年春天，红旗公社的一小撮阶级敌人大刮黑风，妄图破坏春耕生产。库尔班怀着对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情，日夜四处奔走，串连苦大仇深的阶级兄弟一起学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻地揭露了阶级敌人复辟资本主义的阴谋。为了使大家不忘记旧社会的苦，进一步提高阶级斗争觉悟，他还领着大家参观解放前他住的房子和用的东西，同时组织贫下中农开展忆苦思甜活动。许多贫下中农社员流着激动的眼泪说：维尔吾族人民得解放，毛主席的恩情永不忘！
    “读了毛主席的书，越来越年轻”
    乌恰县忠东公社位于新疆的最西边，这里居住着柯尔克孜族的贫下中农和贫苦牧民。他们虽然远离北京，可是心和毛主席紧紧相连。在文化大革命中，柯尔克孜族社员遵照毛主席关于“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，通过办学习班，牧场、田间、家庭都开批判会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新疆代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线。在一次批判大会上，五十岁的巴头马老大娘十分激动地说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么资本家、地主剥削有功，这简直是胡说。在旧社会，我家过着饭不饱肚衣不蔽体的生活，我老头子就是给“巴衣”当长工被折磨死的。中国赫鲁晓夫要我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，这是痴心妄想。
    革命大批判，提高了农牧民阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步促进了思想革命化，人人关心集体的生动事迹不断出现。
    老牧民吐尔干虽然是个文盲，但是他有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。在儿子的帮助下，他天天读毛主席的书，把毛主席的伟大教导落实在自己的行动上。
    今年春天，由于下雪过多，出现了春寒，羊群受到了影响。他心想：羊是国家的财产，一定要加强护理，决不能使它有任何损失。
    一天，全家学习《愚公移山》，吐尔干对老伴和儿子们说：愚公年纪那么老了，还有决心带领他的儿子们挖掉家门前的两座大山。咱们能不能拿出愚公老人的劲头，给羊群修个圈棚呢？他的话刚说完，大家一致拍手赞成。第二天，全家四口人一齐出工，到很远的地方去搬运石头，经过几天的艰苦奋战，终于垒起了两个圈棚，保证了八百多只羊的安全。今年，他牧放的羊群产羔成活率达到了百分之九十八，是全公社成活率最高的羊群之一。有人关切地说：你已经是六十多岁的人了，可要注意身体啊！他高兴地说：学了毛主席的宝书，越来越年轻。　新宝　罗综
