The Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, has already entered our school. We, the revolutionary workers of Fudan University and all revolutionary teachers and students, firmly support this.

Looking back at the situation in our school before the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines was truly shocking. At that time, although I, as a worker, was invited to participate in the school affairs committee, this was purely for show, to put up a front. The leadership of the school was completely in the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and reactionary academic "authorities." They used various excuses to exclude us workers from meetings and prevented us from overseeing school affairs. Moreover, during the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, they exploited our deep feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party, pushing us to the forefront to incite students to fight students and workers to fight students. They truly did evil deeds.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although the reactionary forces in the school have suffered heavy blows, a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders have been continuously trying to reverse the verdict, attempting to regain their lost paradise. Some of the reactionary academic "authorities" who were removed from power are also unwilling to accept defeat. During the period of resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, some of those who think they have "knowledge" and consider themselves "noble" have started to stir again, saying things like "this time it's up to us again," attempting to return to the stage and continue to poison our younger generation. A place like Fudan University, which has been ruled by bourgeois intellectuals for decades, a so-called "higher learning institution" flooded with feudal, capitalist, and revisionist black goods, cannot complete the proletarian educational revolution without the leadership of the working class. The history of the past decade and the practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years have given the answer. "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership by the working class, participation by the working masses, and cooperation with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Together with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must implement the revolutionary combination of the three." Only by firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's great instructions can we complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school.

The working class must lead the school, lead all departments of the superstructure, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao, and it is the great mission bestowed upon us by history. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must firmly grasp the power of the school and the power of the educational revolution in our hands. Only with the leadership of the working class can the educational revolution be carried out to the end. We workers in the school must cooperate closely with the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that has entered the school and fight shoulder to shoulder to complete the glorious and great historical mission given to us by the great leader Chairman Mao.

    把教育大权紧紧掌握在工人阶级手里
    上海复旦大学  蔡祖泉
    上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示指引下，已经进入我校，我们复旦大学的革命工人和全校革命师生坚决拥护。
    回顾文化大革命前我校情况，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争真是触目惊心。那时，我作为一个工人虽然被吸收参加了校务委员会，但这完全是为了摆摆样子，装装门面。学校领导权完全掌握在党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和反动学术“权威”手里，他们制造各种借口排挤我们工人参加会议，不让我们过问学校大事。不仅如此，文化大革命初期，他们还利用我们工人对毛主席和党的深厚感情，把我们推到第一线，挑动群众斗群众，挑动工人斗学生。他们真是干尽了坏事。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，学校里的资产阶级反动势力虽然遭受到沉重的打击，但一小撮死不悔改的走资派一直在搞翻案活动，妄图卷土重来，恢复他们失去的天堂。一些被赶下台的反动学术“权威”也不甘心失败。在复课闹革命中，一些自以为有“学问”的“高贵者”，又探头探脑地活跃起来，说什么“这回又要靠我们这些人啦”，妄图重新登台表演，继续毒害我们的年青一代。象复旦大学这样一所几十年来由资产阶级知识分子统治的顽固堡垒，封、资、修黑货泛滥成灾的所谓“高等学府”，没有工人阶级的领导，单靠学生、知识分子是不能将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的。解放十几年的历史已作了回答；两年来的文化大革命实践也作了回答。“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。”只有坚决执行毛主席的伟大指示，才能完成学校中斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
    工人阶级要领导学校，领导上层建筑的一切部门，加强无产阶级专政，这是毛主席给我们工人阶级的光荣任务，是历史赋予我们工人阶级的伟大使命。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气。我们一定要把学校的大权、教育革命的大权牢牢掌握在我们工人阶级手里。只有工人阶级的领导，才能把教育革命进行到底。我们在校内的工人一定和进校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队通力合作，并肩战斗，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的光荣、伟大的历史使命。
