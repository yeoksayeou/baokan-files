Chairman Mao's Latest Directive:

    Students trained in old-style schools, the majority or a large number of them, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and innovations. However, they must be under the guidance of the correct line and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    毛主席最新指示
    从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。
