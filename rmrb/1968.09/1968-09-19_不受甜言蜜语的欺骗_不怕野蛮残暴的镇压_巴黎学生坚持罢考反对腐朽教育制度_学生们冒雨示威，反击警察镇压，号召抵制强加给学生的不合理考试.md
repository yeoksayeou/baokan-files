Paris students, undeterred by the brutal suppression of the French reactionary ruling clique, bravely continue their struggle against the decayed bourgeois social and educational systems in France. On September 16, medical students of the University of Paris braved the rain to hold a demonstration and fought back against the police who came to suppress them.

The Paris students' boycott of exams, which began on September 5 with a demonstration by more than 5,000 students, has persisted for nearly two weeks. The French reactionary ruling clique is very afraid that this boycott will become the spark for a powerful people's movement in France this autumn and winter. Therefore, they are using every means to try to strangle this struggle.

French President De Gaulle personally intervened on September 9, speaking at a press conference to use both soft and hard tactics to deceive and intimidate the students. At the same time, the French government is trying to sell its so-called "reforms" in education and has sent out large numbers of police and spies to seal off student organizations, beat up progressive students, and vigorously disrupt the students' boycott of exams.

However, the French students, who have been tempered by the revolutionary storm of May and June this year, are not afraid of these tactics. After De Gaulle threatened to suppress "any threat or violence" within less than 24 hours, more than 1,000 Paris students took to the streets again to protest against France's decayed capitalist social and educational systems. Over the past ten days, large numbers of Paris students, despite the threats of being held back or expelled by the reactionary school authorities and the brutal suppression by the police, have continued their struggle in various ways both inside and outside the exam halls. Large numbers of students, standing defiantly against the police surrounding the schools, openly distributed leaflets and pamphlets against the government, calling on students to resist the unfair exams imposed on them. Many students shouted slogans against the unfair exam system as they entered the exam halls, crossed their arms, and sat in silent protest. Some students threw their exam papers out of the exam halls. Students also shouted slogans condemning the government's suppression of the student movement, throwing various objects from the windows at the police gathered outside the exam halls, making it impossible for the exams to continue. On the evening of September 13, medical, science, and literature students in Paris held a protest rally in the university area.

More than 400 students from Nanterre University, which first sparked the student struggle in May and June this year, held a protest meeting on September 11 and occupied a building afterwards to support the medical students' boycott of exams. Many student organizations in Paris issued statements condemning the reactionary ruling clique's crime of sending police to suppress the student movement.

Under the pressure of mass struggles and public opinion, the French Minister of National Education, Fouchet, had to "guarantee" on September 13 that police and spies would no longer be sent into the university area to supervise exams. However, Fouchet stubbornly stated that the exams would continue and openly threatened to expel students who boycotted the exams.

On September 16, hundreds of medical students in Paris braved heavy rain to distribute pamphlets against the government's reactionary policies in front of the medical school and called on their fellow students to continue the struggle against the exams. They discovered that the government had sent a large number of spies disguised as "parents" to continue surrounding the exam halls. The French government's despicable behavior aroused the indignation of students and teachers, who angrily held a demonstration to protest. The French authorities ordered the police to attack the students several times in an attempt to disperse the student crowd, but they failed. The students sang the "Internationale" and bravely fought back against the large number of police suppressing them. On September 17, the French government continued to send large numbers of police to surround the medical school in Paris, but the Paris students, undaunted by the violence, continued to bravely and tenaciously fight on.

    不受甜言蜜语的欺骗　不怕野蛮残暴的镇压
    巴黎学生坚持罢考反对腐朽教育制度
    学生们冒雨示威，反击警察镇压，号召抵制强加给学生的不合理考试
    据新华社十七日讯　巴黎消息：巴黎学生不畏法国反动统治集团的残暴镇压，英勇坚持反对法国腐朽的资产阶级社会制度和教育制度的斗争。巴黎大学医学院学生十六日再次冒雨举行示威游行，并且同前来镇压的警察英勇搏斗。
    从九月五日五千多名学生举行示威游行开始的巴黎学生的罢考斗争，至今已坚持了将近两个星期。法国反动统治集团很害怕这次罢考斗争会成为今年秋冬法国再次爆发强大的人民运动的导火线，因此千方百计力图扼杀这场斗争。
    法国总统戴高乐九日亲自出马，在记者招待会上发表谈话，对学生软硬兼施，进行欺骗和恐吓。与此同时，法国政府极力兜售它的所谓“改革”教育的方案，并派出大批警察和密探，查封学生组织，殴打进步学生，极力破坏学生们的罢考斗争。
    可是，受过今年五、六月革命风暴锻炼的法国学生不怕这一套。在戴高乐扬言要镇压“任何威胁或暴力”以后不到二十四小时，巴黎学生一千多人就再次上街游行，反对法国腐朽的资本主义社会制度和教育制度。十多天来，大批巴黎学生不顾学校反动当局留级、开除的威胁，不怕警察的残暴镇压，在考场内外以各种方式坚持斗争。大批学生在考场门外，横眉勇对包围学校的大批警察，公开散发反对政府的传单和小册子，号召学生们抵制强加给他们的考试。许多学生高呼反对不合理考试制度的口号进入考场，交叉双臂，静坐罢考。有些学生把考试题扔到考场外。学生们还高呼谴责政府镇压学生运动的口号，从窗口把各种物品掷向麇集在考场外的警察，使考试无法进行下去。十三日晚上，巴黎的医科、理科和文科学生在大学区举行抗议大会。
    今年五、六月首先点起学生斗争怒火的巴黎郊区农泰尔学院的四百多名学生，十一日也举行抗议集会，并在会后占领了一所大楼，声援巴黎医学院学生的罢考斗争。巴黎许多学生组织纷纷发表声明，谴责反动统治集团出动警察镇压学生运动的罪行。
    在群众斗争和社会舆论的压力下，法国国民教育部部长富尔十三日不得不“保证”不再派警察和密探进入大学区监督考试。但同时，富尔顽固地表示，考试要继续进行下去，并且公开以开除学籍威胁罢考的学生。
    十六日，巴黎医学院学生数百名，冒着倾盆大雨在医学院门前散发反对政府反动政策的小册子，并号召同学们坚持抵制考试的斗争。他们发现政府派遣了大批密探伪装成学生“家长”，仍旧包围着考场。法国政府这种卑鄙的行为激起了学生和教员们的公愤，他们愤怒地举行示威游行，表示抗议。法国当局指使警察几次向学生进行袭击，企图驱散学生的队伍，但都未得逞。学生们高唱《国际歌》，同镇压学生的大批警察英勇搏斗。十七日，法国政府继续出动大批警察，包围巴黎医学院，但不畏强暴的巴黎学生，仍在英勇顽强地坚持斗争。
