Approximately six thousand Japanese patriotic workers and students held a rally in the open-air concert hall in Tokyo's Hibiya on the evening of the 10th, despite the rain, to severely condemn the Sato reactionary government for serving the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam and plotting to arbitrarily dismiss 50,000 railway workers.

	Slogans such as "Abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!", "Dismantle U.S. Military Bases!", and "Smash the plan to dismiss 50,000 national railway workers under the pretext of modernization!" were posted on the stage.

	Workers and student representatives in their speeches unanimously expressed their determination to smash the "Japan-U.S. security system" and stop the revival of militarism. They also expressed their determination to smash the schemes of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists who peddle the "parliamentary road" and serve the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	The rally passed a resolution supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and supporting the national railway workers' struggle to stop the transportation of U.S. military supplies and to oppose the arbitrary dismissal of 50,000 railway workers. After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration march. They marched towards the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo with high spirits. Although the Sato reactionary government mobilized 5,000 armed police and set up barricades around the U.S. Embassy and the Prime Minister's Office to try to stop the demonstrators, the demonstrators bravely persisted in their demonstration march despite the police's savage suppression.

	The armed police of the Sato reactionary government arbitrarily arrested five patriotic students during this demonstration march.

	Japanese patriotic workers and students held a rally and demonstration march near the U.S. military base in Tachikawa City, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "security treaty," and strongly protesting against the Sato government's transportation of materials and fuel for the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam.

    严厉谴责佐藤反动政府为美帝侵越战争效劳
    日本东京六千爱国工人学生冒雨集会
    工人学生代表一致表示要坚决粉碎日共修正主义分子兜售的“议会道路”
    新华社十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：大约六千名日本爱国工人和学生十日晚在东京日比谷露天音乐堂冒雨举行集会，严厉谴责佐藤反动政府为美帝侵越战争效劳和阴谋无理解雇五万名铁路工人的罪行。
    会场主席台上贴的标语有：“废除日美安全条约！”“拆除美国军事基地！”“粉碎借口实行现代化而解雇五万国营铁路工人的计划！”等。工人和学生代表在讲话中一致表示要坚决把粉碎“日美安全体制”和阻止复活军国主义的斗争进行到底。他们还表示要坚决粉碎日共修正主义分子兜售“议会道路”，为美日反动派效劳的种种阴谋。
  集会通过决议，支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，支持国营铁路工人为阻止运输美国军用物资和反对无理解雇五万名铁路工人而进行的斗争。会后，参加大会的群众举行了示威游行，他们斗志昂扬地向美国驻东京大使馆进发。虽然佐藤反动政府出动了五千名武装警察，布置在美国大使馆和首相府周围，企图阻止示威群众前进，但是，示威群众不顾警察的野蛮镇压，英勇地坚持了示威游行。
    佐藤反动政府的武装警察在这次群众示威游行中无理逮捕了五名爱国学生。
