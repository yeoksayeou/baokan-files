The lights of Yangjialing shine brilliantly, and the pagoda on Baota Mountain stands majestically. The joyous news of a red tide sweeping across the entire nation has reached the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, filling it with excitement. Revolutionary masses have formed a vast procession, holding red revolutionary books and high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, marching through streets and alleys, gathering for meetings and parades. They gaze towards the capital Beijing, singing "The East is Red," and joyously shout long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!

The glorious revolutionary tradition of the Yan'an working class, on this day of great joy, with deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly study the important editorials from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily: "Long Live the Comprehensive Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They are determined to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an cultivated by Chairman Mao and to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The workers of the Yan'an Power Plant, who are currently in the midst of a struggle, criticism, and transformation high tide, have been producing better and better in the past few days. The workers excitedly say: Baota Mountain is high, and the Yanhe River is long; the people of Yan'an forever march towards the red sun. Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow you and dedicate our lives to the revolution, playing a leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work, and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Zhaoyuan Brigade, where the great leader Chairman Mao once resided, have been holding discussions and talks in the fields and on the hillsides in the past few days, enthusiastically discussing the great victory of the Cultural Revolution. They say: The heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but nothing is greater than Chairman Mao's grace. Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer. It was Chairman Mao who led the Red Army, traversing countless mountains and rivers, marching 25,000 li to reach northern Shaanxi, where the red sun that never sets rose over the Shaanxi highlands. It was Chairman Mao who personally commanded the nation's military and people, defeating Japanese imperialism and burying the Chiang Kai-shek regime, establishing the great People's Republic of China. It was Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in various regions, thoroughly foiling their counter-revolutionary plot to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

We, the people of Yan'an, are determined to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and turn Yan'an into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of our motherland!

    延安儿女永远向着红太阳
    杨家岭的灯火辉煌灿烂，宝塔山的宝塔雄伟壮丽，全国山河一片红的喜讯传到革命圣地延安，延安一片欢腾。广大革命群众组成浩浩荡荡的队伍，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，高举伟大领袖毛主席画像，穿街过巷，集会游行。他们仰望着首都北京，高唱《东方红》，纵情欢呼无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    具有光荣革命传统的延安工人阶级，在大喜的日子里，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，反复学习《人民日报》《解放军报》的重要社论：《无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！》他们决心发扬毛主席培育的延安革命精神，胜利完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。正在掀起斗、批、改高潮的延安电厂的革命职工，这两天来的生产搞得越来越好。工人们激动地说：宝塔山高啊延河水长，延安儿女永远向着红太阳。敬爱的毛主席！我们一定要紧跟您干一辈子革命，在文化大革命中和一切工作中发挥领导作用，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席曾经居住过的延安枣园大队的贫下中农，这两天来纷纷在田间、地头举行座谈讨论，畅谈文化大革命的伟大胜利。他们说：天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，是毛主席率领工农红军，踏遍千山万水，长征两万五千里，胜利到达陕北，陕北高原从此升起了永远不落的红太阳。是毛主席亲自指挥全国军民，打败了日本帝国主义，埋葬了蒋家王朝，创立了伟大的中华人民共和国。是毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地区的代理人的滔天罪行，使他们的变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的反革命阴谋彻底破产，进一步巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。
    我们延安儿女决心紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，把延安办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在祖国的上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！（新华社）
