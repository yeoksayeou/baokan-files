The East Wind brings good news from afar,
The nation's landscape is transformed anew.
The sky is red, the earth is red, and the people are even redder,
The golden rays of Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly.

Under this great situation,
I came to a major university in Beijing.
On the very day I entered the school gate,
I saw the school was bustling with activity.

Red flags fluttered in the wind,
Red "Quotations" shone brightly,
Smiling faces turned towards the sun,
Slogans echoed to the heavens:
"Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment!"
"Launch a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform!"
"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

Cheers rose and fell like ocean waves.
Comrades, if you ask what's going on?
The rally has begun!
All because the worker propaganda team has entered the school,
Good leaders have come to the school.

Working together with the People's Liberation Army,
United in struggle with one heart,
Spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions,
Good news keeps coming from the school:
The tide of great unity is unstoppable,
The flames of great criticism soar to the sky;
Red study classes bloom everywhere,
Criticizing the self and overthrowing revisionism yields results.

Today, the revolutionary committee has just been established,
The rally for struggle, criticism, and reform follows immediately.
Clapping shakes the mountains and rivers,
Drums beat, shaking the heavens and earth.
From the crowd, an old worker stands up,
He is the leader of the worker propaganda team, Gong Zhigao.

With a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his hands,
He speaks with great emotion:
"Comrades! Today, the revolutionary committee has been established,
The first shot of victory has been fired.
This is a new starting point,
The tasks ahead are even more important.
Chairman Mao said: 'The masses are the real heroes',
It is the wisdom of the people that is high,
How to do a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform in the next step,
Please, comrades, express your opinions."

As soon as Gong's words fell,
Look! Many comrades want to speak.
In the midst of the cheers, a soldier stands up,
He is the military training platoon leader, Jiang Hongbao.

He opens his mouth and speaks loudly:
"Yes! It is indeed Gong comrade who speaks well.
Establishing the revolutionary committee is just the first step of the long march,
We must press on and not stop.
The current task is to do a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform,
We must work together to shoulder the heavy burden.
Only by doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform,
Can we consolidate and develop new victories;
Only by doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform,
Can we uproot the old educational system;
Only by doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform,
Can we firmly establish the red political power.

(White) Chairman Mao said: 'To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership by the working class...'
The working class has the reddest heart,
The working class has the highest wisdom;
The working class leads everything,
Struggle, criticism, and reform will definitely be done well..."

Jiang Hongbao was about to continue,
A young comrade seized the opportunity to speak:
"Platoon Leader Jiang speaks perfectly,
The working class is indeed good!
The working class takes the stage,
Guiding everything with Mao Zedong Thought.
Reading the red book together with us,
Digging out the roots of selfishness together with us;
Struggling, criticizing, and reforming together with us,
Exterminating demons and monsters together with us.
We are determined, under the leadership of the working class,
To walk the bright path of unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Looking back, the educational front was monopolized by the bourgeoisie,
The school was in chaos.
In the classroom, they chanted the scriptures of revisionism,
In life, they spread the ways of the bourgeoisie.
They excluded us, the children of workers and peasants, from the school gates,
Using all kinds of unscrupulous tricks.
They wanted to restore the old system through these means,
Dreaming of destroying the beautiful landscape."

The young comrade spoke with increasing fervor,
Suddenly, a voice shouted, "Well said!"
Comrades looked forward in unison,
Ah, it was Zhang Hongtao, the assistant teacher of the Chinese department.

Zhang Hongtao heard the exposure of the bourgeois, revisionist, and capitalist roaders,
His heart burned with anger:
"The Chinese Khrushchev is truly despicable,
Always opposing Chairman Mao.
Chairman Mao said, education must serve proletarian politics,
But he howled with reactionary fallacies.
What 'those who labor with their minds rule, those who labor with their strength are ruled',
What 'all professions are inferior, only reading is noble';
Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
The Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown,
This is a great revolution that touches people's souls,
My ideological awareness has also improved."

As he spoke, he turned and shook hands with Old Gong,
Expressing his gratitude:
"Old Gong, since your propaganda team entered the school,
You have helped me greatly.
I understand that education serves whom,
I feel that the working class is a good leader.
'The worker propaganda team should stay in the school for a long time',
This is truly a thousand times good and ten thousand times good.
I am determined to accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers,
To transform myself thoroughly and change my thoughts!"

As Zhang Hongtao's words fell,
Applause roared like a storm.
Gong Zhigao stood up again,
His voice boomed like a bell:
"Chairman Mao has the greatest trust in us, the working class,
We are determined to shoulder the heavy burden.
Learning in struggle and using in struggle,
Raising political awareness in struggle.
With Chairman Mao personally at the helm,
With the comrades of the People's Liberation Army supporting us,
With revolutionary teachers and students fighting together,
With the latest instructions as a treasure,
Under the command of the proletarian headquarters,
Unifying understanding and steps,
Deepening the revolutionary criticism,
Firing at the class enemies.
Seriously doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform,
Turning the university into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!"

Old Gong's speech was praised by everyone in the hall.
Speakers followed one after another,
Each expressing their loyalty to Chairman Mao.
I was so moved that my heart swelled with emotion,
And I specially composed a program to introduce it.

    工人阶级是好领导（竹板书）
    北京部队工程兵毛泽东思想宣传队　辛红　晚顺
    东风万里送喜报，
    全国山河换新貌。
    天红地红人更红，
    毛泽东思想金光照。
    在这一片大好的形势下，
    我来到北京一所大学校。
    这天刚进学校门儿，
    就看到学校里边好热闹。
    一面面红旗迎风舞，
    一本本“语录”红光耀，
    一张张笑脸向太阳，
    一阵阵口号冲云霄：
    “紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署！”
    “掀起斗、批、改新高潮！”
    “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    欢呼声此起彼伏如海涛。
    同志们若问这是咋回事儿？
    誓师大会开始了！
    只因为工人宣传队进校后，
    学校里来了好领导。
    配合人民解放军，
    团结战斗心一条。
    把毛主席最新指示来传播，
    学校里不断传捷报：
    大联合洪流不可挡，
    大批判烈火冲天烧；
    学习班红花遍地开，
    斗私批修见实效。
    今天刚刚成立了革委会，
    斗、批、改誓师大会紧接着。
    哗哗哗掌声震得山河动，
    咚咚咚战鼓擂得天地摇。
    人群中站起一位老工人，
    他就是工人宣传队的负责同志巩志高。
    他手捧《毛主席语录》本，
    激动万分把话表：
    “同志们！今天成立了革命委员会，
    打响了胜利的第一炮。
    这是前进的新起点，
    今后的任务更重要。
    毛主席说：‘群众是真正的英雄’，
    还是大家的智谋高，
    下一步怎么搞好斗、批、改，
    请同志们把意见来发表。”
    老巩的话音刚落地，
    瞧！要求发言的真不少。
    喊声中站起一位解放军，
    他就是军训排长江红保。
    他放开嗓门大声讲：
    “对！还是老巩同志说得好。
    成立革委会这只是万里长征第一步，
    咱们要乘胜前进不停脚。
    眼下的任务就是搞好斗、批、改，
    咱们要齐心协力把重担挑。
    只有搞好斗、批、改，
    才能巩固和发展新胜利；
    只有搞好斗、批、改，
    才能把旧的教育制度连根刨；
    只有搞好斗、批、改，
    才能把红色政权巩固牢。
    （白）毛主席说：‘实现无产阶级教育革
    命，必须有工人阶级领导，……’
    工人阶级心最红，
    工人阶级智慧高；
    工人阶级领导一切，
    斗、批、改一定能搞好。……”
    江红保还要往下说，
    一位小将抢过话头开了炮：
    “江排长说得全在理儿，
    工人阶级就是好！
    工人阶级上讲台，
    处处以毛泽东思想作指导。
    和我们一起同读红宝书，
    和我们一起把私根刨；
    和我们一起搞斗、批、改，
    和我们一起除魔妖。
    我们决心在工人阶级的领导下，
    走与工农兵结合的光明道。
    想过去，教育阵地被资产阶级所垄断，
    学校里搞得一团糟。
    课堂上念的是‘修’字经，
    生活上散布的是资产阶级那一套。
    他们把咱工农子弟排斥在校门外，
    施尽了不可告人的鬼花招。
    他们想通过这些搞复辟，
    梦想把大好山河来毁掉。”
    小将越说火越大，
    突然传来一声：“讲得好！”
    同志们不约而同地朝前看，
    啊，原来是中文系的助教张红涛。
    张红涛听到揭露封、资、修，
    心中怒火往外冒：
    “中国赫鲁晓夫真可恨，
    一直和毛主席唱反调。
    毛主席说，教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，
    可是他却把反动谬论来嚎叫。
    什么‘劳心者治人，劳力者治于人’，
    什么‘万般皆下品，唯有读书高’；
    经过这场文化大革命，
    中国赫鲁晓夫被打倒，
    这是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命啊，
    我的思想觉悟也提高啦。”
    说话间他转身握住老巩的手，
    感激万分把话表：
    “老巩啊，自从你们宣传队进校后，
    对我的帮助真不小。
    我懂得了教育为谁来服务，
    我体会到工人阶级是好领导。
    ‘工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去’，
    真是一千个好来一万个好。
    我决心接受工农兵的再教育，
    脱胎换骨彻底把思想来改造！”
    张红涛话音刚落地，
    掌声哗哗似狂飙。
    巩志高二次站起身，
    说话的嗓门象铜钟敲：
    “毛主席对我们工人阶级最信任，
    我们决心把千斤重担肩上挑。
    在斗争中学来在斗争中用，
    在斗争中把政治觉悟来提高。
    有毛主席亲自来掌舵，
    有解放军同志来撑腰，
    有革命师生员工齐战斗，
    有最新指示无价宝，
    在无产阶级司令部的号令下，
    统一认识，统一步调，
    深入开展革命大批判，
    向阶级敌人猛开炮。
    认真搞好斗、批、改，
    把大学办成毛泽东思想的大学校！”
    老巩讲的这番话，全场人人都夸好。
    发言的一个接一个，
    个个向毛主席把忠心表。
    感动得我激情满怀心潮涌，
    特意的编了个节目来介绍。
