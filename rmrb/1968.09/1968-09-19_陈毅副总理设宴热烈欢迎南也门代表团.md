Vice Premier Chen Yi holds banquet to warmly welcome South Yemen delegation

Vice Premier Chen Yi condemns U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism for attempting to redivide the world and carve out spheres of influence, and for promoting neo-colonialism. He firmly supports the just struggle of the Arab peoples against U.S. and Israeli aggression.

Foreign Minister Zale condemns the aggression and plunder of the U.S. and British imperialists against the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He expresses support for the anti-imperialist struggles of all peoples and wishes success to the revolution led by Chairman Mao.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, September 18 -- Vice Premier Chen Yi held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome Foreign Minister Saf al-Ahmad Zale of the People's Republic of South Yemen and the delegation he heads.

At the banquet, filled with a friendly atmosphere, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister Zale both spoke.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The people of South Yemen have a glorious revolutionary tradition. The declaration of independence in November 1967 was the result of the South Yemen people's long struggle and a major victory after four years of armed struggle. We believe that the South Yemen people, tempered by armed struggle, will, as long as they remain vigilant, strengthen unity, and persist in struggle, certainly advance continuously in the cause of safeguarding and consolidating national independence."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Although China and South Yemen are separated by vast oceans, our common struggle against imperialism has closely linked us together. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, teaches us: 'The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive.' South Yemen friends can be assured that in your struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, the Chinese people will always be your reliable friends."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The current international situation is characterized by 'the enemy rotting away day by day, and us getting better day by day.' U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are very afraid of the revolutionary storm of the world's peoples. They collude with each other and also vie with each other, attempting to redivide the world and carve out spheres of influence to dominate the world situation and promote neo-colonialism. In the Caribbean crisis, Soviet revisionism first adventured and then capitulated, actually acknowledging that Cuba is within the sphere of influence of U.S. imperialism. Regarding the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation, Soviet revisionism is pseudo-supportive and actually treacherous, helping U.S. imperialism to attempt to achieve the goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam. During the Middle East war last year, Soviet revisionism was also pseudo-supportive and actually controlling towards the Arab peoples, actually helping U.S. and Israeli aggression. In Africa, Soviet revisionism even openly, together with U.S. and British imperialism, supports the Nigerian federal military government, carrying out large-scale massacres of the Biafra people, attempting to use this to squeeze into Nigeria and share equally with imperialism. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has always pretended to be friends of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but in reality, they are the most treacherous accomplices of U.S. imperialism. The recent incident of Soviet revisionism brazenly sending troops to occupy Czechoslovakia further shows that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism can tolerate each other within their respective spheres of influence, doing as they please, lawlessly and shamelessly. One U.S. imperialism, one Soviet revisionism, both are the most ferocious enemies of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world."

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out, "The Soviet revisionist invasion of Czechoslovakia has strengthened the position of U.S. imperialism and its aggression tool, Israel, in the Middle East, fomenting the aggressive arrogance and expansionist ambitions of Zionism. At present, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, is strongly supporting Israel in exerting military pressure on Arab countries; on the other hand, it is desperately trying to use the United Nations to seek a 'political solution,' forcing Arab countries to kneel in surrender. Under the current new international conditions, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique will certainly further betray the interests of the Arab peoples."

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated, "Israel is a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression, and China does not recognize Israel. Zionism is an extremely reactionary current of thought, and we firmly oppose it. We firmly support the just struggle of the Arab peoples against U.S. and Israeli aggression. We firmly oppose the treacherous plots of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique to betray the interests of the Arab peoples. We believe that the Palestinian and Arab peoples who dare to persist in revolutionary struggle are invincible by any force. No matter how many twists and turns there are on the road ahead, the revolutionary Arab peoples will one day drive U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism out of the vast Arab lands."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech, "At present, our people are advancing victoriously under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "Now, in our country, 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province) have all established revolutionary committees, achieving a sea of red across the motherland. The 700 million Chinese people have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor as they are now. Everywhere in our country is a thriving revolutionary scene."

Minister Saf al-Ahmad Zale said in his speech, "The long-term armed liberation struggle experienced by the heroic Chinese people is an example for the peoples of all countries who are struggling for freedom to rid themselves of imperialism. Today, the Chinese people are carrying out the Cultural Revolution to further develop the fundamental revolutionary cause, relying on the broadest fighting masses of the people to realize and deepen socialism."

Minister Zale talked about the South Yemen people's struggle against British imperialism for liberation. He said, "Due to long-term armed struggle and the leadership of the National Front, our people have smashed and defeated colonialism, forced colonialism to withdraw, and established the republic on November 30, 1967. This is a victory over the imperialist forces and reactionary lackey forces of the whole world. But they will not be reconciled and are plotting various conspiracies to extinguish our people's victory. He said, "The subversion of the People's Republic of South Yemen is linked to the continuous subversion of imperialism and the Saudi reactionaries against our North Yemen, to the U.S. policy of escalating aggression against the heroic Vietnamese people and Democratic Vietnam, and to the policy of aggression launched on June 5, 1967, and the attempt to continue occupying Palestinian and Arab lands by imperialism and Zionism. This shows that imperialism and colonialism are determined to persist in their aggressive policies to maintain their power and interests and continue to plunder the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

Minister Zale said, "All revolutionaries and progressives in the world should unite to deal with imperialism and colonialism. Because the enemy is deploying in every place in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we, as revolutionaries and progressives of the whole world, should tighten our fists in the face of imperialism and colonialism. Otherwise, we will leave a gap in our ranks for imperialism to preserve its power and engage in conspiracies."

In talking about this visit to China, he said, "The encirclement of imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries cannot separate us from our sincere revolutionary friends."

Minister Zale said, "Our republic's people, National Front, and government watch you with great admiration and wish the revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong success. We strongly condemn the attempt of world imperialism and colonialism to prevent the People's Republic of China from taking its rightful seat in the United Nations. He expressed that South Yemen supports the struggle of the people of Oman, Dhofar, and the Arabian Gulf against British imperialism, supports the resistance of the Palestinian people. He said, "We also consistently and wholeheartedly support the republican system of the brotherly Arab Republic of Yemen, oppose the subversive plots of imperialism and the Saudi reactionaries, and strive for the comprehensive unification of Yemen side by side."

He strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. He said, "We stand firmly on the side of the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people, and we demand that the progressive and liberation forces of the whole world strengthen their support for the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism. Similarly, we strongly condemn the aggression against Democratic Vietnam. We will do our best to support the liberation movements of Asia and Africa. We condemn the policy of racial discrimination against the African people."

Those attending the banquet today included representatives of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the capital's workers, responsible members of Beijing's revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the garrison troops in Beijing, and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, and other sectors, including Wang Xinting, Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Xie Huai'de, Xiang Qian, Ding Xilin, and others.

Ambassadors from Arab and African countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    陈毅副总理设宴热烈欢迎南也门代表团
    陈毅副总理谴责美帝苏修妄图重新瓜分世界和划分势力范围，推行新殖民主义；坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美、以侵略的正义斗争。
    扎莱外交部长谴责美英帝国主义对亚非拉人民的侵略和掠夺；表示支持各国人民反帝斗争；祝毛主席领导的革命取得胜利。
    新华社十八日讯　国务院副总理陈毅今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎南也门人民共和国外交部长塞弗·艾哈迈德·扎莱和由他率领的南也门人民共和国代表团。
    在充满友好气氛的宴会上，陈毅副总理和塞弗·艾哈迈德·扎莱部长先后讲话。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，南也门人民具有光荣的革命传统。一九六七年十一月南也门宣告独立，这是南也门人民长期斗争的结果，是南也门人民坚持四年武装斗争的重大胜利。他说，我们相信，经过武装斗争锻炼的南也门人民，只要保持警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够在维护和巩固民族独立的事业中，不断前进。
    陈毅副总理说，中国和南也门虽然远隔重洋，但是，反对帝国主义的共同斗争，把我们紧密地连接在一起。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导我们：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”南也门的朋友们可以相信，在你们反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中，中国人民将永远是你们可靠的朋友。
    陈毅副总理说，当前国际形势的特点是，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。美帝、苏修十分害怕世界人民的革命风暴。他们相互勾结，而又相互争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界和划分势力范围，来主宰世界局势，推行新殖民主义。在加勒比海危机中，苏修对美帝先冒险，后投降，实际上承认了古巴是美帝的势力范围。对越南人民的抗美救国战争，苏修是假支持、真出卖，实际上是帮助美帝妄图实现永远霸占越南南方的目的。去年中东战争时，苏修对阿拉伯人民也是假支持、真控制，实际上帮助了美、以的侵略。在非洲，苏修甚至公开同美帝、英帝一道，支持尼日利亚联邦军政府，大规模屠杀比夫拉人民，妄图以此挤进尼日利亚，同帝国主义平分秋色。苏修叛徒集团一贯假装是亚非拉人民的朋友，实际上是美帝国主义最阴险的帮凶。最近苏修悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克的事件，进一步表明，美帝、苏修可以互相容忍在各自势力范围以内，为所欲为，无法无天。一个美帝，一个苏修，都是全世界革命人民最凶恶的敌人。
    陈毅副总理指出，苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，加强了美帝及其侵略工具以色列在中东的地位，助长了犹太复国主义的侵略气焰和扩张野心。目前，美帝国主义一方面大力支持以色列对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力；另一方面，又竭力企图通过联合国，搞“政治解决”，迫使阿拉伯国家屈膝投降。在目前新的国际条件下，苏修叛徒集团必然要进一步出卖阿拉伯人民的利益。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中重申，以色列是美帝国主义的侵略工具，中国绝不承认以色列。犹太复国主义是一种极其反动的思潮，我们坚决反对。我们坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝和以色列侵略的正义斗争。我们坚决反对苏修叛徒集团出卖阿拉伯人民利益的罪恶阴谋。他说，我们相信，真正敢于坚持革命斗争的巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民，是任何力量也压不垮的。不管在前进的道路上还有多少迂回曲折，革命的阿拉伯人民总有一天要把美帝国主义和苏联修正主义从广大的阿拉伯土地上统统赶出去。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，目前我国人民正在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他说，现在，我国二十九个省、市、自治区（除台湾省外），已经全部成立了革命委员会，实现了祖国山河一片红。七亿中国人民从来没有象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。在我国到处是一片欣欣向荣的革命景象。
    塞弗·艾哈迈德·扎莱部长在讲话中说，英勇的中国人民所经历的长期的武装解放战争，是为摆脱帝国主义、争取自由而斗争的各国人民的榜样。今天，中国人民为了进一步发展根本的革命事业，正在进行文化大革命，以便依靠最广泛的战斗的人民群众，实现和深化社会主义。
    扎莱部长谈到了南也门人民反对英帝国主义的解放斗争。他说，由于长期的武装斗争和民族阵线的领导，我国人民粉碎和打败了殖民主义，迫使殖民主义撤离，并在一九六七年十一月三十日成立了共和国，这是对全世界帝国主义力量和反动走狗势力进行斗争的胜利。但是，它们不会甘心，企图策划各种阴谋，扑灭我国人民的胜利。他说，对南也门人民共和国的颠覆，是同帝国主义和沙特反动派对我们北也门的不断颠覆相联系的，是同美国对英勇的越南人民和民主越南的侵略政策的升级相联系的，是同发动一九六七年六月五日侵略、并企图继续侵占巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯土地的帝国主义和犹太复国主义的侵略政策相联系的。他说，这表明帝国主义和殖民主义是要顽固地坚持它们的侵略政策的，以便维持它们的势力和利益，继续掠夺亚、非、拉美人民。
    扎莱部长说，世界上一切革命者和进步人士一致起来对付帝国主义和殖民主义。因为敌人正在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切地方进行部署，我们作为全世界进步的革命者就更应该在帝国主义和殖民主义面前握紧我们的拳头。否则，我们就会在自己的队伍里给帝国主义留下一个缺口，被帝国主义用来保存其势力、搞阴谋活动。
    他在谈到这次对中国的访问时说，帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派的包围并不能把我们同真诚的革命的朋友们隔离开来。
    扎莱部长说，我们共和国人民，民族阵线和政府以极其钦佩的心情注视着你们，并祝由毛泽东主席所领导的革命取得胜利。我们强烈谴责世界帝国主义和殖民主义不让中华人民共和国取得她在联合国正当席位的企图。他表示，南也门支持阿曼、佐法尔和阿拉伯湾人民反对英帝国主义的斗争，支持巴勒斯坦人民抵抗运动。他说，我们也始终一贯全力支持兄弟的阿拉伯也门共和国的共和制度，反对帝国主义和沙特反动派的颠覆阴谋，为实现也门全面统一并肩前进。
    他强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略。他说，我们坚决站在英勇的越南人民的正义斗争一边，我们要求全世界的进步和解放力量加强对越南人民的声援，以便彻底战胜美帝国主义。同样，我们强烈谴责对民主越南的侵略。我们将尽自己的力量支持亚非解放运动。我们谴责对非洲人民实行的种族歧视政策。
    出席今天宴会的，有首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，北京市各革命群众组织的负责成员和驻京部队五好战士的代表，以及我国政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会和其他方面的负责人王新亭、乔冠华、李强、谢怀德、向前、丁西林等。
    阿拉伯和非洲国家驻我国使节应邀出席了宴会。
