Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai, sent a telegram to the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, expressing heartfelt thanks for their warmest congratulations on the establishment of revolutionary committees throughout our country (excluding Taiwan Province). They resolutely support the revolutionary action of Albania withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. This fully expresses the profound proletarian internationalist friendship of 700 million Chinese people towards the fraternal Albanian people and demonstrates the unbreakable fighting unity between the peoples of China and Albania.

The heroic Albanian people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great Marxist-Leninist, and the Albanian Party of Labour, have raised high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and waged an unyielding struggle against modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists. The People's Republic of Albania solemnly declared its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, dealing another heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and greatly encouraging the struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. This heroic revolutionary action fully demonstrates the Albanian people's heroic spirit of daring to fight to the end against all enemies in the world, and their high principle of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army express their heartfelt admiration and resolute support!

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has long since degenerated into social imperialism and social fascism. It colludes with U.S. imperialism to brutally invade, control, enslave, and threaten the peoples of various countries, attempting to redivide the world. The Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionists has long been used to promote great-power chauvinism and national egoism, to plunder and enslave the peoples of Eastern Europe, and to engage in dirty deals with U.S. imperialism. It has completely become an evil tool of aggression, no different from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization concocted by U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionists, along with the revisionist partners from Poland, Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, brazenly under the banner of the Warsaw Pact, launched a armed invasion of Czechoslovakia and reached a filthy deal with the Czechoslovak revisionist leadership under the bayonet. This is a blatant exposure of the aggressive and reactionary nature of this pact. The facts clearly prove that the Soviet revisionists, under the guise of "defending the socialist family," are engaged in the evil deeds of imperialism and colonialism. The Soviet revisionists, like U.S. imperialism, are evil bullies who do all sorts of evil things and are the most vicious enemies of the people of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All aggressors and their running dogs in the world will be buried, and the time is not far away."

The Warsaw Pact manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, like the various military aggression blocs concocted by U.S. imperialism, is already crumbling and disintegrating and will be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary people who dare to struggle and dare to win.

The Albanian people are heroes who stand tall and firm. As the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "... those who can frighten the brave Albanian people, there were none in the past, and there are still none now." The Albanian people, fearless of violence, resolutely withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Currently, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, the revolutionary mass movements in Europe, North America, and Oceania are surging, and the just struggles of the peoples of Eastern Europe against Soviet revisionist control are flourishing. The revolutionary struggles of all peoples in the world who are subjected to invasion, control, enslavement, and threats by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are surging higher and higher. U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all harmful creatures are speeding towards their doom, and their days are numbered.

"Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the Albanian comrades. No matter what happens in the world, we will resolutely stand together with our Albanian comrades, fight together, and win together. If U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their running dogs dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only meet with thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

    坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命行动
    我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理，打电报给阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志和部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，衷心感谢他们对我全国（除台湾省外）成立革命委员会的最热烈祝贺，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚退出华沙条约的革命行动。这充分表达了七亿中国人民对兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民深厚的无产阶级国际主义友谊，显示了中阿两国人民牢不可破的战斗团结。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，对以苏修为首的现代修正主义进行了针锋相对的毫不妥协的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严宣布退出华沙条约，给了苏修叛徒集团又一沉重打击，大大鼓舞了东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团的斗争。这一英勇的革命行动，充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民敢于同世界上一切暴敌战斗到底的英雄气概，表现了他们的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的高度原则性。中国人民和中国人民解放军，表示衷心的敬佩和坚决的支持！
    苏修叛徒集团早已堕落成为社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义。它同美帝狼狈为奸，野蛮地侵略、控制、奴役和威胁各国人民，妄图重新瓜分世界。苏修叛徒集团控制的华沙条约，早已被它们用来推行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义，用来掠夺和奴役东欧各国人民，用来同美帝进行肮脏交易，它完全变成了罪恶的侵略工具，同美帝搞的北大西洋公约组织已经没有什么两样了。苏修纠集波、德、匈、保四修伙伴，公然打着华沙条约旗号，武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克，并与捷修领导集团达成刺刀下的肮脏交易，就是这个条约的侵略性和反动性的赤裸裸大暴露。事实清楚地证明，苏修控制华沙条约，打的是“保卫社会主义大家庭”的幌子，干的是帝国主义、殖民主义的罪恶勾当。苏修和美帝一样，都是无恶不作的大恶霸，都是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。”
    苏修操纵的华沙条约，同美帝拼凑的形形色色的军事侵略集团一样，已经分崩离析，支离破碎，必将被敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命人民所彻底埋葬。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的英雄人民。正如阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志所说的：“……能够吓倒阿尔巴尼亚人的勇士，过去没有，现在也还没有生出来。”阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏强暴，毅然退出华沙条约，为各国革命人民的反帝反修斗争树立了光辉的榜样。
    目前，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动风起云涌，欧洲、北美、大洋洲的革命群众运动波澜壮阔，东欧各国人民反对苏修控制的正义斗争蓬勃开展，全世界一切受美帝、苏修侵略、控制、奴役和威胁的人民的革命斗争，一浪高过一浪。美帝、苏修和一切害人虫正在加速走向灭亡，它们的寿命不长了。
    “中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼得更加坚强的中国人民和中国人民解放军，永远和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟心连心。不管世界上发生什么事情，我们都坚决同阿尔巴尼亚的战友们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。如果美帝、苏修及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，只能遭到彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
