Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work."

Chinese Khrushchev, from his counter-revolutionary standpoint, has consistently and frenziedly opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He regards workers as cattle and horses, treating workers like the Japanese invaders and feudal overlords. He relentlessly denigrates, slanders, and attacks the working class, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing factories," aiming to achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party and the state, and restoring capitalism.

In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff of our factory, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, filled with boundless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, fully played the leading role of the working class. After 55 days of arduous struggle, they rapidly put into production a 65-unit modern large-scale coking plant that had been halted and dormant for seven years by the likes of Chinese Khrushchev, creating a rare miracle in the history of coking worldwide. This gave Chinese Khrushchev and those bourgeois technical "authorities" who slander workers with "this won't work" and "that won't work" a resounding slap in the face.

Believing in a few "experts" or trusting the masses

Believing in a few "experts" or firmly relying on the broad masses of workers is a major struggle we waged against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by Chinese Khrushchev in the battle to put the 65-unit coking plant into production.

The 65-unit coking plant was designed and constructed by our country under the guidance of the General Line for Socialist Construction. It was completed in 1960. Just as the workers were full of confidence and striving to put it into production as soon as possible, the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in order to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the General Line, shot out the poisonous arrow of "industry must retreat sufficiently," viciously halting this coking plant. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing factories" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev. They decided to use the wisdom and strength of the working class to make the 65-unit modern large-scale coking plant, which had been dormant for seven years, serve socialist construction in the shortest possible time.

The key to putting the 65-unit coking plant into production is "drying the furnace." The speed and quality of drying the furnace directly affect whether it can be put into production on time and the lifespan of the furnace, making it a highly technical task. According to domestic and foreign records, drying such a large coking plant usually takes 60 days. Several bourgeois technical "authorities" proposed more than ten plans, with the most advanced one taking 45 days. The workers, however, proposed a plan to complete the drying task in 41 days. The two opinions were fiercely debated. An engineer said: "Based on my past experience, drying such a coking plant takes at least 45 days. When our factory built the furnace for the first time, it was the Japanese invaders who dried it, and they planned to take 67 days but actually took 120 days; for the second time, nine foreign experts came, and it also took 68 days. I've never heard of drying such a coking plant in 41 days." The workers said: "The past drying of furnaces can't compare with today's. The Japanese invaders built the furnace to plunder our country's property, so why would the workers work hard for them? When the foreign 'experts' built the furnace, they followed the revisionist line, and everything was decided by the 'experts.' We workers had strength but couldn't use it. Now we control the enterprise, have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; the furnace is also built by ourselves, we know its temperament, and we can definitely dry it in 41 days." When the two opinions were at an impasse, should we believe in bourgeois "experts" or support the workers? The stationed troops, following Chairman Mao's instructions to believe in and rely on the masses, conducted investigations and research, and boldly supported the workers' opinion. As a result, it only took 40 days to successfully complete the drying task, breaking the superstition of bourgeois "experts" with facts, and creating conditions for on-time production.

Tying the hands of workers or mobilizing the revolutionary masses

During the process of putting the 65-unit coking plant into production, the broad revolutionary staff continuously broke through the various rules and regulations used by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to tie the hands of workers, achieving one victory after another.

While drying the furnace, the battle to weld the recovery pipeline was launched. According to the old rules, to prevent gas explosions, production had to be stopped for welding. This way, the other two coking furnaces that were in production also had to be stopped, allowing the gas to be released into the sky. This not only wasted a large amount of national wealth but also seriously affected the health of residents. After the gas was released, it directly affected the production of sister factories, causing even greater losses to the country. Revolutionary workers, with a strong sense of ownership, dared to think and act, proposing a plan to weld without stopping production. Could it be done? Several so-called "experts" immediately jumped out, citing rules and regulations, both obstructing and threatening the workers, saying: "You can't do this, it doesn't conform to the procedures, and if an accident occurs, the entire coking plant will go up in flames!" Should we tie the hands of the masses with old frameworks, or should we mobilize the revolutionary masses? The stationed troops and old workers repeatedly discussed and believed that the workers' ideas had scientific reasoning. After experiments, they were proven correct, so they firmly supported the workers' opinion, discarding the dead rules that tied the hands of workers. The workers, with a strong sense of responsibility, did a good job of preparing for the welding, and after intense labor, successfully welded the recovery pipeline.

After drying the furnace, the two-ton furnace doors had to be installed one by one on the furnace body. Due to the long stoppage of production and incomplete equipment, the hooks on the furnace doors could not be hooked onto the furnace body. The engineering technician researched for a day but found no solution. There was no ready-made answer in any book, and finally, they could only propose a head-painting and foot-painting method: use gas welding to cut off a piece of the furnace door rib, barely able to hook it up, but the furnace body and furnace door did not fit tightly. After production, flames would surely rush out, quickly burning the edges of the furnace door. Everyone was scratching their heads over this matter. This was known by the old worker Chen Junqiu, who, based on his 30-plus years of experience, proposed loosening the furnace door's pull rod screws a bit to hook it up. However, some "experts" mocked him, saying he was joking, and most technicians also lacked confidence and dared not boldly support him. The stationed troops and old workers, however, firmly supported him, and as a result, the furnace doors were quickly and smoothly hung up one by one.

Facts most vividly prove Chairman Mao's pointing out that "the most intelligent and talented are the warriors with the most practical experience." Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the real heroes. Mobilizing the masses brings wisdom and strength, making them invincible. Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, slanders the working class as "unreliable," while elevating bourgeois technical "authorities" to the skies, making the working masses listen to them in everything. If the so-called "experts" on whom Chinese Khrushchev relies to "manage factories" were to handle the 65-unit coking plant, could they solve many of the technical problems encountered during production? Definitely not! The 65-unit coking plant could not possibly be put into production in such a short time.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Who manages the factory is a big issue of who controls the factory's seal. Chinese Khrushchev, to realize his dream of restoring capitalism, vigorously promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing factories," attempting to let bourgeois "experts" seize all the production and technical powers of the factory, binding the working masses under their control. Our struggle against Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices is a struggle for the leadership of the enterprise. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of the "Anshan Constitution," advance victoriously, rely on the working class, give full play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work, and welcome the new high tide of the socialist industrial revolution.

### 工人阶级必须掌握企业大权

专栏：

    我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。  毛泽东
    工人阶级必须掌握企业大权
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”谬论本溪钢铁公司第二焦化厂革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫从他的反革命立场出发，一贯猖狂反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想。他把工人看作牛马，象日本侵略者、封建把头那样对待工人。他竭力贬低、诬蔑、打击工人阶级，拚命推行反革命修正主义的“专家治厂”路线，以达到他篡党篡国，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂广大的革命职工，在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，艰苦奋战五十五天，使一座被中国赫鲁晓夫之流砍下马、沉睡了七年的六十五孔现代化大型炼焦炉，高速度地投入了生产，创造了世界炼焦史上罕见的奇迹。这给了中国赫鲁晓夫以及那些诬蔑工人“这也不行”、“那也不行”的资产阶级技术“权威”们一记响亮的耳光。
    迷信少数“专家”还是信任工人群众
    迷信少数“专家”，还是坚定不移地依靠广大工人群众，是我们在六十五孔焦炉投产战斗中，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线进行的一场大斗争。
    六十五孔焦炉是在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国自己设计，自己施工，于一九六○年建成炉体的。正当工人们满怀信心，力争早日投产的时候，党内最大的一小撮走资派，为了反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对总路线，放出了“工业上要退够”的毒箭，恶狠狠地把这座炼焦炉砍下了马。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，决心以工人阶级的智慧和力量，使沉睡了七年的六十五孔现代化大型炼焦炉在最短的时间内为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    六十五孔焦炉投产的关键是“烘炉”，烘炉的快慢和好坏，直接影响到能否按期投产和炉子的寿命，是一项技术性很强的工作。根据国内外资料的记载，烘好这样一座大型炼焦炉，一般需要六十天。一些资产阶级技术“权威”先后提出了十几个方案，其中最先进的也要四十五天。工人群众却提出了四十一天完成烘炉任务的方案。两种意见争论得很激烈。一个工程师说：“根据我以往的经验，烘好这样的焦炉最少也得四十五天。咱们厂第一次建炉是日本侵略者烘的，他们计划烘六十七天，实际烘了一百二十天；第二次建炉先后来了九个外国专家，也烘了六十八天，四十一天烘成这样的焦炉我还没听说过。”工人们说：“过去的烘炉根本不能和今天比。日本侵略者建炉是掠夺我国财产，工人谁给他好好干？外国‘专家’建炉时，搞的也是修正主义的一套，什么都是‘专家’说了算，我们工人有劲也使不上。现在我们掌握企业大权，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想；炉子又是自己建的，知道它的脾气，四十一天一定能烘好。”在两种意见争执不下的时候，是迷信资产阶级“专家”呢，还是支持工人群众？驻厂解放军遵照毛主席相信群众、依靠群众的教导，经过调查研究，大胆支持了工人的意见。结果只用了四十天，就胜利完成了烘炉任务，用事实打破了对资产阶级“专家”的迷信，为按期投产创造了条件。
      束缚工人手脚还是发动群众革命
    六十五孔焦炉在投产过程中，广大革命职工不断地冲破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人用以束缚工人手脚的条条框框，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    烘炉的同时，打响了焊接回收管道的战斗。按过去的老规矩，为了防止煤气爆炸，必须停产焊接。这样，正在生产的另两座焦炉也必须停产，让煤气往天空放散。这不仅浪费国家大量财富，而且严重地影响居民的健康。煤气放散后还直接影响到兄弟厂的生产，给国家造成更大的损失。革命工人以高度的主人翁精神，敢想敢干，提出不停产焊接的方案。能行吗？一些所谓“专家”马上跳了出来，搬出条条，又是阻拦，又是恐吓，对工人说：“你们这样干，不符合规程，发生事故整个焦化厂就要上天！”是用老框框束缚群众，还是放手发动群众革命？驻厂解放军和老工人反复进行讨论，认为工人的想法有科学道理，经过试验，得到了证明，就坚决地支持了工人的意见，抛开了束缚工人手脚的死条条。工人们以高度责任感做好了焊接的准备工作，经过紧张的劳动，成功地焊接好了回收管道。
    烘炉完成后，要把两吨重的炉门一个个安到炉体上。由于停产时间过长，再加上设备又不成套，炉门上的挂钩和炉体挂不上。工程技术员研究了一天也没有办法，任何书上都找不到现成的答案，最后只得提出一个头痛医头脚痛医脚的办法：用气焊把炉门筋割下一块，勉强能挂上，但炉体和炉门结合不严，投产后势必火舌呼呼地往外窜，很快就会把炉门边烧坏。大家都为这事挠头。这事被老工人陈俊奎知道了，他根据三十多年的经验，提出把炉门拉条螺丝松一松就可以挂上。可是有些“专家”却讽刺地说他开玩笑，大多数技术员也没有把握，不敢大胆支持。驻厂解放军和老工人却坚决支持，结果很快使炉门一个个顺利地挂上了。
    事实最生动地证明了毛主席指出的“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”这个伟大真理。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众是真正的英雄，发动了群众就有了智慧，就有了力量，就无往而不胜。中国赫鲁晓夫站在反动的资产阶级立场上，诬蔑工人阶级“靠不住”，而把资产阶级技术“权威”捧上天，要工人群众处处、事事都听他们的。如果让中国赫鲁晓夫赖以“治厂”的所谓“专家”来搞六十五孔焦炉，投产中的许多技术问题能解决吗？肯定不能！六十五孔焦炉决不可能在这样短的时间里投入生产。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”谁来治厂，这是工厂的大印由谁来掌的大问题。中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现他复辟资本主义的迷梦，拚命地推行反革命修正主义的“专家治厂”路线，妄图让资产阶级“专家”把工厂的生产技术大权统统抓过去，把工人群众束缚在他们的控制之下。我们同中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的斗争，是争夺企业领导权的斗争。我们一定要高举“鞍钢宪法”的伟大红旗，乘胜前进，依靠工人阶级，发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，迎接社会主义工业革命的新高潮。
