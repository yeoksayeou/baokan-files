Workers and peasants in several Latin American countries have continued their struggles against tyranny and for the right to live in recent days.

Several hundred dock workers in the Mexican port of Acapulco continued their strike on September 7, demanding wage increases. The strike, which began on September 5, has brought 80 percent of the port's shipping to a standstill.

In Santiago, Chile, more than 500 workers at the "Casa de Moneda de Chile" factory, which produces Chilean currency and corrugated paper, began an indefinite strike on September 4, demanding higher wages.

In southern Chile, near the port of Monte, more than 200 peasants at the "Chepa" forestry estate occupied the estate owner's house by force on September 1, demanding land to cultivate. Despite threats from the authorities, they have continued their struggle, occupying the estate owner's house until September 5. They also cut off all roads leading to the estate to prevent the police from coming to suppress them.

In the northern Argentine province of Salta, more than 650 agricultural workers at an estate owned by the Avra Grande Company recently went on strike to protest the estate owner's layoffs. The striking workers bravely fought back against the police's violent suppression and even attacked the homes of the company's bosses.

Since April this year, the Brazilian people have been continuously fighting against American imperialism and the dictatorship, fiercely striking at the evil rule of the American-Brazilian reactionaries. The picture shows the brave Brazilian people linking arms and taking to the streets for a massive anti-American, anti-dictatorship demonstration. (Newspaper photo)
