The great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. Mao Zedong

The radiant glory of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the southwest border of the motherland. The Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City are born in glory.

More than 50,000 military and civilian personnel gathered in Lhasa to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This great victory has dealt a heavy blow to American and British imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, greatly consolidating the southwest border defense of the motherland. People of all ethnic groups are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, consolidate the border defense, and build the southwest border of the motherland into a great iron wall.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 6th: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and with the warm concern of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the southwest border of the motherland, the frontline of the struggle against American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Indian reactionaries, has echoed with a resounding victory song: The Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City have been born in glory amidst the stormy class struggle. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a matter of class struggle." In the 17 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has been extremely sharp and complex. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Tibet and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have waged a long, fierce, and heroic struggle against the domestic and foreign class enemies, repeatedly defeating them, driving out imperialist forces from Tibet, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the feudal serf-owning class, thoroughly smashing the evil plots of the reactionary feudal serf-owners represented by the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, who colluded with American and British imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Kuomintang bandits, and Indian reactionaries to split the unity of the motherland, oppose socialism, and attempt to restore the feudal serf system, thoroughly exposing and settling the accounts of the heinous crimes of Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, and the anti-party clique of Xi Zhongxun's black henchman Fan Ming against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and achieving one major victory after another.

Great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have shown great concern for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Tibet. At every critical moment of the struggle, Chairman Mao has given the most timely and wise instructions to the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Tibet. The first generation of the working class in Tibet, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, and the revolutionary Red Guards, with their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have, under the great call of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters," held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and launched a sustained and fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, Zhou Renshan, Wang Qimei, and a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders. After more than two years of fierce struggle, they have thoroughly smashed their evil plots to collude with the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's treasonous clique and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries to restore the serf system and capitalism in Tibet, and have achieved decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This great victory has dealt a heavy blow to American and British imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Indian reactionaries, greatly consolidating the southwest border defense of the motherland.

"The unity of the military and the people is like one person; see who can defeat us?" The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have actively responded to the great order of the great commander Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and have enthusiastically used Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, doing a great deal of work in the "three supports and two militaries" and achieving great successes. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have fought shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups, smashing the sabotage plots of domestic and foreign class enemies, repelling the armed provocations of the Indian reactionaries, bravely defending the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and defending the southwest border of the motherland.

The snow-capped mountains shine with gold, the grasslands are dressed in new clothes, and the vast plateau is adorned with red flags. On September 5th, the entire city of Lhasa was filled with joy. More than 50,000 military and civilian personnel, overflowing with the joy of victory, surrounded the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing praises to the great leader Chairman Mao, and gathering from all directions to the Lhasa Sports Stadium to hold a grand rally, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City.

The celebration began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the atmosphere was electric. People, with their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

During the joyous days of celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees, from Mêdog and Zayu to the vast grasslands of northern Tibet, from the rugged mountains of the Yadong frontier to the rolling golden waves of the Jinsha River, a million liberated serfs danced and sang: The Himalayas are high, but they have a peak; the Yarlung Zangbo River is long, but it has a source. The kindness of Chairman Mao is endless. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We sincerely wish you—our heart's reddest red sun—eternal life! Eternal life!

Comrade Zeng Yongya, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the celebration. He said: The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the result of the warm concern and wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Comrade Zeng Yongya said that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, lead the broad revolutionary masses to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, and expose and settle the accounts of their anti-revolutionary revisionist line. We must thoroughly clean up the class ranks, accurately and firmly strike at a handful of class enemies, and root out the hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries. We must strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of contradictions, resolutely protect the masses, and fiercely strike at the class enemies.

Comrade Zeng Yongya said that we must, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our understanding, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary "theory of multiple centers is no center," and resolutely defend and implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Comrade Zeng Yongya said that the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." All levels of Revolutionary Committees must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously implement streamlining and downsizing, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, protect the masses, and closely connect with the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses. We must strive to build the Revolutionary Committee into a battle command center that firmly acts according to Mao Zedong Thought, highlights proletarian politics, and has proletarian authority.

Comrade Zeng Yongya said that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the most fundamental and important task is to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply throughout the region, vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further carry out activities of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, break with selfishness and establish the public, transform one's worldview, promote the proletarianization of people's thinking, and build Tibet into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Comrade Zeng Yongya finally said that Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." In all our work, we must fully play the leading role of the working class in Tibet, and everything must be led by the working class. We must resolutely rely on the working class, further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must further deeply carry out the "support the military and love the people" and "support the government and love the people" movements, strengthen the unity between the military and the people and among the people of all ethnic groups, better implement the great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," strive to develop agricultural and industrial production and national defense construction, and do all work better and better, achieving an overall victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Comrade Ren Rong, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and responsible comrade of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the celebration on behalf of the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the troops stationed in Tibet, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City. He said that all soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet will resolutely support and defend the newly born Revolutionary Committees, resolutely maintain the proletarian revolutionary authority of the Revolutionary Committees, and resolutely suppress the evil plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage and overthrow the Revolutionary Committees. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet will definitely, following the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao, "support the government and love the people," resolutely protect the broad masses, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies. We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, consolidate the border defense, and build the southwest border of the motherland into a great iron wall. If the Indian reactionaries dare to invade our sacred territory, we will definitely "annihilate them completely and thoroughly."

Comrades Ba San, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Liang Chao, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Lhasa City, also spoke at the meeting.

Comrades Chen Mingyi, Liao Biyun, Yang Dongsheng, Miao Peiyi, Abo Aqingjinmei, Tao Changsong, Liu Shao Min, Tudeng Nima, Zhu Jingshang, Ma Ruihua, and Ciren Lhamo, Deputy Chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and responsible comrades of the Tibet Military Region and the troops stationed in Tibet attended the celebration.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand parade was held.

In the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was born in glory on September 5th. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang sang and danced, enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”西藏和平解放十七年来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一直十分尖锐、复杂。西藏各族革命人民和驻藏人民解放军，同国内外阶级敌人进行了长期、激烈、英勇的斗争，经过反复较量，驱逐了帝国主义势力出西藏，推翻了反动的农奴主阶级统治，彻底粉碎了以达赖、班禅为代表的反动农奴主勾结美、英帝国主义、苏联修正主义、蒋介石匪帮和印度反动派，分裂祖国统一，反对社会主义，妄图复辟封建农奴制度的罪恶阴谋，彻底揭发和清算了彭德怀、高岗、习仲勋反党集团黑干将范明的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，取得了一个又一个的重大胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，对西藏的无产阶级文化大革命非常关怀。在斗争的每一个关键时刻，毛主席都给西藏各族革命人民作了最及时、最英明的指示。西藏第一代工人阶级、各族革命人民和革命的红卫兵小将，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的伟大号召下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏的代理人周仁山、王其梅等一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，发动了持续的猛烈的进攻。经过两年多的激烈搏斗，彻底粉碎了他们勾结达赖、班禅叛国集团和国民党反动派残渣余孽妄图在西藏复辟农奴制度和资本主义的罪恶阴谋，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。这一伟大胜利，沉重地打击了美、英帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度反动派，极大地巩固了祖国的西南边防。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”人民解放军驻藏部队广大指战员，积极响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，在“三支”“两军”工作中做了大量的工作，取得了巨大成就。广大指战员同各族革命群众并肩战斗，粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，打退了印度反动派的武装挑衅，勇敢地保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，保卫了祖国西南边防。
    雪山闪金光，草原换新装，万里高原，红旗招展。九月五日，拉萨市全城一片喜气洋洋。五万多军民满怀胜利的喜悦，簇拥着毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱对伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌，从四面八方汇集到拉萨市体育场，举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝西藏自治区革命委员会和拉萨市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告西藏自治区革命委员会和拉萨市革命委员会胜利诞生时，全场欢声雷动，群情沸腾。人们怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，不断振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在庆祝革命委员会成立的欢乐节日里，由墨脱、察隅到遍地是牛羊的藏北高原，从丛山峻岭的亚东前哨到麦浪滚滚的金沙江畔，百万翻身农奴欢舞歌唱：喜马拉雅山再高也有顶，雅鲁藏布江再长也有源，毛主席的恩情啊！永远唱不完。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们衷心祝愿您——我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    西藏自治区革命委员会主任曾雍雅同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说：西藏自治区革命委员会的成立是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部亲切关怀和英明领导的结果。
    曾雍雅同志说，革命委员会成立以后，一定要遵照毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，带领广大革命群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在西藏的代理人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，肃清他们推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。要认真地清理阶级队伍，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，把隐藏的特务、叛徒、死不改悔的走资派和一切反革命分子挖出来。要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，坚决保护人民群众，狠狠打击阶级敌人。
    曾雍雅同志说，我们必须在以伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底批判资产阶级反动的“多中心即无中心论”。对毛主席的指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，必须认真学习，勇敢捍卫，坚决执行。
    曾雍雅同志说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”各级革命委员会一定要遵照毛主席的教导，认真实行精兵简政，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，保护群众，密切联系群众，使革命委员会深深扎根于群众之中。要努力把革命委员会建设成为坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，突出无产阶级政治，有无产阶级权威的战斗指挥部。

    曾雍雅同志最后说，毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们在各项工作中，要充分发挥西藏工人阶级的领导作用，必须由工人阶级领导一切，坚决依靠工人阶级，进一步全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改。要进一步深入开展“拥军爱民”、“拥政爱民”运动，加强军民之间的团结和各族人民之间的团结，要更好地贯彻“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，努力发展工农业生产和国防建设事业，把各项工作做得好上加好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
