To cover up the aggressive nature of Soviet revisionist social imperialism, TASS put up a fig leaf on August 30. It listed a long bill of goods, boasting as if it were reciting a rosary, about the "aid" provided by the Soviet revisionists to Czechoslovakia. TASS assumed the air of a benefactor, talking at length about "providing" supplies to Czechoslovakia and "meeting" the needs of Czechoslovakia, from coal from the Donbas to flour from Ukraine, everything was available. What a great, selfless, and comprehensive "aid"! With such talk, the heinous crimes of using airplanes, cannons, and tanks to occupy Czechoslovakia and suppress the Czechoslovakian people seem to be wiped out with a single stroke of the pen.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The counterrevolutionary business of the imperialist governments is done every day, but in words, in official documents, it is always full of righteousness and morality, or at least partly righteousness and morality, and never tells the truth." The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is exactly like this.

The figures listed by TASS cannot cover up the ferocious face of the bandit. The wolf in the Russian fairy tale, wearing a beautiful headscarf, disguises itself as "grandma" to eat children. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, under the banner of "aid," disguises itself as a "philanthropist," with the sole purpose of carrying out ruthless plunder.

"According to official materials, in 1967, Soviet-Czechoslovakian trade reached 1.7547 billion rubles. Czechoslovakia purchased 870.7 million rubles worth of goods, and the Soviet Union purchased 884 million rubles worth of goods." Look, how "equal and mutually beneficial," how "balanced" it is! But the figures of TASS can only deceive naive children. The trade within the CMEA is unequal; it is a means by which Soviet revisionist social imperialism exploits and squeezes other member countries. A machine from Czechoslovakia and other "allies" in the CMEA can only exchange for 140 tons of iron sand in the Soviet Union, but in other markets, it can exchange for 520 tons. This means that for every 140 tons of iron sand exported, the Soviet revisionists plunder goods worth 380 tons of iron sand from Czechoslovakia. Just by calculating the 50 million tons of iron sand exported by the Soviet revisionists to Czechoslovakia from 1966 to 1970, Czechoslovakia has been plundered without compensation for goods worth 9,500 million tons of iron sand. Can such ruthless plunder be covered up by the two "800 million" rubles of TASS?

TASS shamelessly boasts: "The Soviet Union has almost fully met Czechoslovakia's need for oil." This is also nonsense! The Czechoslovakian revisionists are economically dependent on the Soviet revisionists, with 80% of their iron sand and almost 100% of their oil indeed relying on Soviet supplies. However, TASS deliberately avoids mentioning how expensive the oil in the "friendship" pipeline is. For example, a railway vehicle from Czechoslovakia and other CMEA member countries can only exchange for 1,300 tons of oil in the Soviet Union, but in other markets, it can exchange for 3,400 tons. TASS also avoids mentioning that the uranium from the Czechoslovakian Jáchymov uranium mine is entirely "satisfying" the needs of the Soviet revisionists and cannot be sold to "countries other than the Soviet Union"!

TASS says, "In the past ten years, the average annual grain imports from the Soviet Union have accounted for one-third of the state unified procurement of grain in the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic." This is equivalent to pointing at the Dubček clique and saying: You eat my grain and still want "freedom," still want to leave my rule! The wheat of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists is not good to eat. It is poison bait, used to implement their policy of neo-colonialism. The Czechoslovakian revisionists, because they eat more than 100 million tons of Soviet revisionist wheat every year, with every three loaves of bread having one from the Soviet revisionists, can only be slaves under the rule of social imperialism. Economic independence is not possible, and political independence is out of the question!

TASS, as the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionists, did not forget that the Soviet revisionists also built a broad-gauge railway in Czechoslovakia. It proudly boasts: "To reduce the freight of these goods, a broad-gauge railway has been built from the Soviet-Czechoslovakian border to Košice." What a shameless face! Is it that the Soviet revisionists have extended their broad-gauge railway all the way to the heart of Czechoslovakia just to "reduce the freight of these goods"? Is the cost of freight worth such a large-scale construction? The Soviet revisionist army occupied Czechoslovakia for eight hours, and the broad-gauge railway was unobstructed, which was of great help. In short, the true purpose of building the broad-gauge railway is to facilitate economic plunder and to facilitate the transport of troops. Isn't this clear as day?

The self-deceiving and deceiving lies of TASS can be put away!

The Soviet revisionist social imperialists regard Czechoslovakia as their sphere of influence. It is no surprise that the Soviet revisionists and the Czechoslovakian revisionists reached an agreement under the bayonet. The heavy shackles of the CMEA, such as "international division of labor" and "economic integration," have long been placed on the necks of the Czechoslovakian revisionists. They can only pull the cart obediently; otherwise, the big stick of the Soviet revisionists is merciless and will come crashing down. However, TASS forgot that Czechoslovakia belongs to the Czechoslovakian people! Although the Dubček renegade clique has betrayed the country, the Czechoslovakian people will not tolerate their homeland being controlled and plundered by the Soviet revisionists for a long time. The brave Czechoslovakian people are becoming more and more awakened, and they will surely rise up in rebellion, overthrow the rule of the Czechoslovakian revisionists, and break free from the slavery of the Soviet revisionists!

    破烂的遮羞布
    外贸部反修兵
    为了掩盖苏修社会帝国主义的侵略实质，塔斯社八月三十日张起了一块遮羞布。它开列一大堆账单，如数家珍地宣扬苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的“援助”。塔斯社摆出了一副“恩主”的架子，大谈“提供了”对捷克斯洛伐克的供应，“满足了”捷克斯洛伐克的要求，从顿巴斯的煤到乌克兰的面粉，百货俱全。多么伟大的、无私的、全面的“援助”啊！这么一说，用飞机、大炮、坦克武装占领捷克斯洛伐克和镇压捷克斯洛伐克人民的滔天罪行，似乎都可以一笔勾销了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”苏修叛徒集团也正是这样。
    塔斯社列举的这一堆数字，掩盖不了强盗的凶恶面目。俄罗斯童话中的狼，披上美丽的头巾，化装成“奶奶”，是为了吃孩子。苏修叛徒集团打着“援助”这个漂亮的幌子，把自己化装成“慈善家”，目的正是为了进行残酷的掠夺。
    “据官方材料，一九六七年苏捷贸易达十七亿五千四百七十万卢布。捷克斯洛伐克购买了八亿七千零七十万卢布的商品，苏联购买了八亿八千四百万卢布的商品。”看，多么“平等互利”，多么“平衡”啊！但塔斯社的数字只能蒙蔽不懂事的孩子。“经互会”内部的贸易是不平等的，是苏修社会帝国主义剥削和榨取别的成员国的一种手段。“经互会”包括捷克斯洛伐克在内的各“盟国”的一台机器，在苏联只能换到一百四十吨铁砂，而在别的市场上可以换到五百二十吨。这就是说，苏修每出口一百四十吨铁砂，就要剥削捷克斯洛伐克价值相当于三百八十吨铁砂的商品。仅以一九六六——一九七○年苏修向捷克斯洛伐克出口五千万吨铁砂计算，捷克斯洛伐克就等于无代价地被苏修掠夺了价值相当于九千五百万吨铁砂的商品。这种残酷的掠夺，难道用塔斯社的两个“八亿”多卢布的数字就能掩盖得了吗？
    塔斯社无耻地吹嘘：“苏联提供的东西几乎充分地满足了捷克斯洛伐克对石油的需要”。这也是鬼话！捷修在经济上依附苏修，百分之八十的铁砂和几乎百分之百的石油，的的确确要靠苏联供应。但是，塔斯社故意避而不谈，“友谊”输油管的石油价钱是多么昂贵。举例说，包括捷克斯洛伐克在内的“经互会”成员国的一台铁路车辆，在苏联只能换到一千三百吨石油，而在别的市场可以换到三千四百吨。塔斯社更避而不谈，捷克斯洛伐克的塔霍夫铀矿的铀，全部“满足了”苏修的需要，不能卖给“除了苏联以外的国家”！
    塔斯社说，“最近十年，捷克斯洛伐克每年从苏联进口的粮食平均占捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国国家统一征购粮的三分之一。”这等于是指着杜布切克集团的鼻子说：你们吃了老子的粮食还要“自由”，还要离开老子的统治！美帝苏修的小麦，都不是好吃的。那是毒饵，是它们用来推行新殖民主义政策的。捷修正因为每年吃了苏修一百多万吨的麦子，每三个面包就有一个是苏修的，也就只能做社会帝国主义阶下之奴。经济上不能独立，政治上的独立当然就谈不到了！
    塔斯社不愧为苏修的喉舌，竟然没有忘记苏修在捷克斯洛伐克境内还修了一条宽轨铁路。它得意地吹嘘说：“为降低这些货物的运费已经修建了一条从苏捷边界到科希策的宽轨铁路”。真是死不要脸！难道苏修把自己的宽轨一直修到捷克斯洛伐克的腹地，仅仅是“为降低这些货物的运费”？难道运费的代价也值得如此大兴土木吗？苏修军队八小时占领捷克斯洛伐克，宽轨铁路畅通无阻就帮了大忙。说穿了，修宽轨铁路的真正目的，一是便于经济掠夺，二是便于运兵。这不是昭然若揭的吗？
    塔斯社自欺欺人的鬼话，可以收起来了！
    苏修社会帝国主义把捷克斯洛伐克当作自己的势力范围。苏修和捷修在刺刀下达成协议，这是不足为怪的。“经互会”的一套一套沉重的枷锁，什么“国际分工”、“经济一体化”，等等，早已套在捷修脖子上了。只有乖乖的拉车，否则苏修大棒子是无情的，就要凌空而下。但是，塔斯社忘了，捷克斯洛伐克是捷克斯洛伐克人民的！尽管杜布切克叛徒集团卖国投降，而捷克斯洛伐克人民是不会容忍他们的祖国长期遭受苏修的控制和掠夺的。英勇的捷克斯洛伐克人民正在日益觉醒，他们一定会起来造反，推翻捷修的统治，摆脱苏修的奴役！
