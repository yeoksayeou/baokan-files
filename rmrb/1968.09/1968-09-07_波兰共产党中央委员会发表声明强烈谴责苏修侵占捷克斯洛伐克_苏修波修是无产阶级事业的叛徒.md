	The Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party on August 24 issued a statement in Warsaw strongly condemning the brutal aggression by Soviet revisionists and their lackeys against Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people.

	The statement said that after the signing of the Bratislava Declaration, which claimed to respect the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs, Czechoslovakia was occupied within days. The hypocrisy, treachery, shamelessness, and brutality of these conspirators have reached their peak. The armed attack on Czechoslovakia has the savage characteristics of a fascist invasion.

	The Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, on behalf of the Polish working class and all laboring people, condemns the shameful, treacherous, and bandit-like attack by the military forces of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, including Poland, on the brotherly Czechoslovak people. The statement said that the Soviet revisionists and their satellite countries, including Poland, have used the pretext of defending socialism to invade Czechoslovakia, but this deceives no one. In reality, this is merely a continuation of the policy of betraying revolutionary interests and the principles of proletarian internationalism, using tanks and cannons to push forward. This is a manifestation of bourgeois state relations. Thus, it was decided to achieve through savage armed attacks what could not be achieved through the letters and meetings of the Warsaw Pact. For months, "brotherly" consultations were held around the table, but at night, they acted like bandits. This is the true face of modern revisionists after they have removed their masks; this is the true face of traitors to the proletarian cause and the running dogs of the bourgeoisie.

	The statement said that the Soviet revisionists and their satellite countries, including Poland, have invaded Czechoslovakia, exposing the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States. Johnson merely feigned regret. Thus, we see the harmonious cooperation between these two superpowers in the new division of the world. Every imperialist bandit has the right to maintain order in its sphere of influence according to its own needs. Czechoslovakia is within the Soviet revisionists' sphere of influence, while South Vietnam is within the American sphere of influence.

	The statement pointed out that the Polish working class and the Polish Communist Party firmly believe that the heroic Czechoslovak working class will establish its revolutionary political organization and lead the laboring masses to victory. The Czechoslovak working class must take its problems into its own hands. Trust in the Dubček counter-revolutionary and capitulationist clique means submitting to the open enemies of revolution and socialism.

	After severely condemning the Gomułka revisionist clique, the statement said that this clique sent Polish troops to Czechoslovakia, following in the footsteps of the pre-war Polish reactionary bourgeoisie.

	The statement pointed out that these political adventurers and enemies of the people must be severely punished and driven out, because they will only bring sacrifices and suffering to the people, and they will bring disgrace to the reputation of Poland, which has fought for freedom on all fronts. The Polish army and the armies of other revisionist countries, under the command of Soviet revisionist leaders, are occupying Czechoslovakia. In other words, these armies are playing the role of invaders and occupiers, benefiting the domestic and foreign reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries. No Polish worker, no honest Pole, no Polish soldier will agree to this. Soldiers of the Polish People's Army, you have been deceived by the Gomułka clique. Return to your country, because the class enemies of the proletarian dictatorship are within your country.

	The statement emphasized that modern revisionism, centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, is leading the so-called socialist countries into disaster for the people and society, handing over power to the big bourgeoisie. People's Poland, in order to live and develop as a true socialist country, must break away from the Moscow communist traitors and must first liberate itself from the Gomułka traitor clique and support the activities of People's Poland with its boundless strength.

	The statement finally pointed out that the Polish Communist Party is today the only Marxist-Leninist party in Poland, representing the heroic traditions of the Polish proletariat and being the true vanguard of the Polish working class. The Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party calls on all true revolutionaries, calls on all soldiers and officers of the Polish People's Army to unite and struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat. A great danger is threatening Poland, socialism, and the people's power. Today, an attack has been launched on Czechoslovakia, and tomorrow, another attack may threaten Poland. We cannot rely on the bayonets of the Soviet Union, but must rely on our revolutionary forces and our material resources to build socialism in Poland.

    波兰共产党中央委员会发表声明强烈谴责苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克
    苏修波修是无产阶级事业的叛徒
    号召一切真正革命派、波兰人民军的一切战士和军官团结起来为无产阶级专政而奋斗
    新华社六日讯　波兰共产党中央委员会八月二十四日在华沙发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者及其仆从对捷克斯洛伐克和捷克斯洛伐克人民进行的残暴侵略。
    声明说，在修正主义阴谋家炮制的布拉迪斯拉发声明——它宣称要尊重平等和不干涉别国内政原则——签字后才几天，整个捷克斯洛伐克就被占领了。这些阴谋家的虚伪和背信，无耻和残暴达到了极点。对捷克斯洛伐克发动的武装进攻具有法西斯式的野蛮侵略的特点。
    波兰共产党中央委员会代表波兰工人阶级和全体劳动人民，谴责苏联及其仆从国，包括波兰在内的军队对兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民发动的可耻的、背信弃义的、强盗般的进攻。声明说，苏修及其包括波兰在内的仆从国对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，虽然是利用所谓保卫社会主义的词句来进行的，却欺骗不了任何人，因为事实上这只不过是用坦克和大炮来推行那种背叛革命利益和无产阶级国际主义原则的虚伪政策的继续。这是资产阶级的国家关系的表现。这样，就决定通过野蛮的武装进攻来实现用华沙条约信件和会议所不能实现的东西。几个月来在圆桌旁进行了“兄弟般”的协商，而夜间却象强盗一样地干。这就是现代修正主义者撕下假面具以后的真面目；这就是背叛无产阶级事业的叛徒和资产阶级走狗的真面目。
    声明说，苏修及包括波兰在内的仆从国对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略同时也暴露了苏美之间的勾结。约翰逊仅仅装腔作势地表示了遗憾。这样，我们便看到了美苏这两个大国在重新瓜分世界中情投意合的合作。每个帝国主义强盗都按照自己的需要在其势力范围内维护建立秩序的权利。捷克斯洛伐克在苏修的势力范围之内，而南越则在美国的势力范围之内。
    声明指出，波兰工人阶级和波兰共产党坚信英雄的捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级将建立它的革命的政治组织并领导劳动群众取得胜利。捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级必须把它的问题掌握在自己的手里。对杜布切克反革命和投降主义集团的信任意味着俯首听命于革命和社会主义的公开敌人。
    声明在严厉谴责了哥穆尔卡修正主义集团之后说，这个集团派遣波兰军队到捷克斯洛伐克，这是步战前波兰反动资产阶级的后尘。
    声明指出，必须严惩这些政治冒险家和人民的敌人，并把他们赶下台，因为他们只会使人民遭受牺牲和苦难，他们使波兰的一切优秀儿女在各个争取自由的战线上为之战斗的波兰的声誉蒙受耻辱。波兰的军队和其他修正主义国家的军队，在苏联修正主义将领的统率下，正在占领着捷克斯洛伐克，一句话，这些军队扮演着侵略者和占领者的角色而有利于国内外的反动派和反革命。任何一个波兰工人，任何一个正直的波兰人，任何一个波兰士兵，都不会同意这种事情。波兰人民军的士兵们，你们被哥穆尔卡集团欺骗了，返回你们的国家吧，因为无产阶级专政的阶级敌人是在你们国内。
    声明强调指出，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义正在把所谓的社会主义国家引导到人民和社会的灾祸中去，把政权拱手献给大资产阶级。人民的波兰为了能够象一个真正的社会主义国家那样生活和发展，必须脱离莫斯科的共产主义叛徒们，必须首先从哥穆尔卡叛徒集团中解放出来，并用自己无穷无尽的力量支持人民波兰的活动。
    声明最后指出，波兰共产党今天是波兰唯一的马克思列宁主义的党，它代表着波兰无产阶级的英雄的传统，并且是波兰工人阶级的真正的先锋。波兰共产党中央委员会号召一切真正的革命派，号召波兰人民军的一切战士和军官，团结起来为无产阶级专政而奋斗。巨大的危险正在威胁着波兰和社会主义以及人民政权。今天发动了对捷克斯洛伐克的进攻，明天，另一次进攻将威胁着波兰。不能依靠苏联的刺刀，而应当依靠我们的革命力量和我们的物质资源，在波兰建设社会主义。
