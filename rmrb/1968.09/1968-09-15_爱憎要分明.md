Chairman Mao teaches us: “Never forget class struggle.”

Distinguish Between Love and Hate

A group from Class 5, Grade 3 was assigned to the prefabrication workshop of the Capital Steel Plant's cement team for labor. They learned from the workers. The cement team had quite a few electrical devices—vibrating tables, vibrating rods, electric motors, electric carts, and so on. These things were unfamiliar to the students, so they were eager to learn and adopted a humble attitude.

At this time, a man who looked like an old worker seemed to notice the students' intentions and quickly approached them, answering all their questions. He explained the principles, structure, and operating methods of the vibrating tables in detail. The students listened and felt that he was quite knowledgeable, so they wanted to take him as their teacher. However, many old workers in the team kept their distance from the students. During a break, an old worker surnamed Hui called the students together and said seriously, “Don’t forget the class struggle in our team! We must take root among the working class! Landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders are not on our side; they are not walking the same path as us!” These words made the students think deeply. Later, they found out that this “enthusiastic” person was not an old worker but a counter-revolutionary undergoing labor reform in the prefabrication workshop.

The stark reality of class struggle shocked every student. Some students said painfully, “We took the wrong path and sat on the wrong side. The old workers’ momentary dissatisfaction with us shows that they distinguish between love and hate!” Others said, “Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us ‘Never forget class struggle,’ but we forgot it as soon as we entered the factory.”

The students discussed among themselves: Why did they become so close to a counter-revolutionary as soon as they entered the factory? Why did they take him as a learning model and take root with him? Water has a source, and trees have roots. After everyone seriously examined themselves, they found that the source and the root were the common backer of all counter-revolutionaries—Chinese Khrushchev.

Chinese Khrushchev and his agents promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in schools, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, opposing the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and advocating “intellectual education first,” “grades as the criterion,” and “building schools on expertise.” This black line is thick and deep, and its poison is widespread. Some students said, “I was poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev. As soon as I entered the factory, I thought about learning technology and focused on it, forgetting everything else.” “Whoever can teach me technology is a good teacher.” This is the harm caused by Chinese Khrushchev’s counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on the students.

Through this living example, the students opened their eyes and remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching that politics is the commander and the soul. The worker teachers were very happy to see the progress of the young comrades. They repeatedly instructed the young comrades to learn from the working class, stressing that the most fundamental thing is to never forget class struggle.

    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”
    爱憎要分明
    三年级五班一个小组被分到首都钢铁厂预制车间水泥队劳动，拜工人为师。水泥队电器设备可不少，什么振动台啦，振动棒啦，电动机啦，电瓶车啦等等，这些玩艺儿过去同学们从未见过，因此都想嘴勤点儿，态度虚心些，好好学一番。
    这时，车间有个“老工人”模样的人，好象看出了同学们的心思，赶快凑近来，有问必答，什么振动台的原理、构造、操作方法，讲得头头是道。同学们一听，感到他挺有技术，就想拜他为师。可是这个队的很多老工人却对同学们远离了。一次休息的时候，一位姓回的老工人把同学们叫到一起，语重心长地说：“不要忘了咱们队的阶级斗争啊！扎根要扎到工人阶级身上啊！地富反坏右、叛徒、特务、走资派跟咱们可不是一个心眼，走的可不是一条路啊！”这些话引起了同学们的深思，事后一了解，原来这个“热情”人并不是老工人，而是在预制车间劳动改造的反革命分子。
    触目惊心的阶级斗争的现实，震惊了每一个同学。有的同学沉痛地说：“咱们走错路了，屁股也坐歪了，老工人一时对我们有意见，说明他们爱憎分明啊！”有的同学说：“毛主席反复教导我们‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，可是我们一到工厂就忘记了。”
    同学们于是议论开了，为什么一下厂就和一个反革命分子打得火热呢？为什么把他当作学习对象，把根扎到他身上呢？水有源，树有根，经过大家认真检查，这个源、这个根就是一切反革命分子的总后台——中国赫鲁晓夫。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在学校推行反革命修正主义教育路线，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对活学活用毛泽东思想，大搞什么“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”、“业务建校”。这条黑线又粗又深，流毒很广。有的同学说：“我就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫这个毒了，一下厂想的是学技术，一心钻到技术里，什么都忘了。”“谁能教我技术，谁就是好师傅。”这就是中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线对同学们的毒害。
    通过这个活生生的事实，使同学们擦亮了眼睛，都把毛主席的政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导铭记心间。工人师傅看到小将们的进步，高兴极了。一再嘱咐小将，向工人阶级学习，最根本的一条，就是要学习不忘阶级斗争。
