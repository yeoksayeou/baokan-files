The nation's first small, simple hydrogen gas generator was successfully trial-produced in Suzhou, making an important contribution to the further development of China's semiconductor industry.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on the 10th, the revolutionary workers of the Suzhou Transistor Factory in Jiangsu Province, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have taken the path of self-reliance. With the help and support of relevant departments, they recently successfully trial-produced the nation's first small, simple hydrogen gas generator, making an important contribution to the further development of China's semiconductor industry.

The characteristics of this device are: small size, convenient transportation, high efficiency, low investment, and a cost of less than one-twentieth of the original hydrogen production equipment; at the same time, the structure is simple, and it can be manufactured by any general factory. In early August, the central authorities and more than 20 provinces and cities across the nation held a field meeting in Suzhou to appraise this device, unanimously agreeing that this device has many advantages. Its successful manufacture is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The hydrogen gas generator is a key piece of equipment for the development of the semiconductor industry. In the past, due to the advocacy of "crawlingism" and "slavery" by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the machinery industry, the initiative and creativity of the working class were constrained. Therefore, currently, only large cities and a few medium-sized cities in China have large and cumbersome hydrogen production equipment, while medium and small cities lack simple hydrogen production equipment, affecting the development speed of the semiconductor industry.

During the vigorous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Suzhou Transistor Factory criticized the revisionist line of enterprise management and the "crawling philosophy" of the Chinese Khrushchev, determined to overcome the difficulty of manufacturing hydrogen gas equipment. With the cooperation of Zhejiang University, Jiangsu Province Radio Research Institute, Suzhou Metal Rolling Mill, and other units, they carried forward the great, fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, overcoming many difficulties in the trial production. Many workers had their skin burned by chemicals and their clothes burned, but they paid no heed, insisting on conducting experiments. Through continuous summarization and improvement, they finally successfully manufactured the nation's first small, simple hydrogen gas generator not long ago. This not only created conditions for the widespread development of the semiconductor industry in China's medium and small cities but also met the needs of other industrial developments.

    全国第一台小型简易氢气发生设备在苏州试制成功
    为我国进一步发展半导体工业作出了重要贡献
    据新华社南京十日电　江苏省苏州晶体管厂革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走“自力更生”的道路，在各有关部门的帮助和支持下，最近试制成功了全国第一台小型简易氢气发生设备，为我国进一步发展半导体工业作出了重要贡献。
    这台设备的特点是：体积小，运输方便，效率高，投资少，造价不到原制氢设备的二十分之一；同时结构简易，一般工厂都能制造。八月上旬，中央主管部门和全国二十多个省、市的有关单位在苏州召开现场会，对这台设备进行了鉴定，一致认为这台设备优点很多，它的制造成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    氢气发生设备是发展半导体工业所需的关键设备之一。过去，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在机械工业部门的代理人鼓吹“爬行主义”、“奴隶主义”，束缚了工人阶级的积极性、创造性，因此，目前我国只有大城市和少数中等城市有大而笨重的制氢设备，中小城市则因缺乏简易的制氢设备而影响半导体工业的发展速度。
    苏州晶体管厂的革命职工在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线和“爬行哲学”，立志攻下制造氢气设备这道难关。他们在浙江大学、江苏省无线电研究所、苏州金属轧制厂等单位的协作下，发扬敢想，敢说，敢干的大无畏革命精神，克服了试制中的许多困难。许多工人不止一次地被化学药物烧焦了皮肤，烧坏了衣服，但他们全然不顾，坚持进行试验。经过不断总结，不断改进，终于在不久前将全国第一台小型简易氢气发生设备制造成功，不仅为我国中小城市普遍发展半导体工业创造了条件，而且适应了其它工业发展的需要。
