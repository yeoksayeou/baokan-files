One-third of the Standing Committee of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee has gone deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations and research, summarizing typical experiences to guide the city-wide struggle, criticism, and transformation. While participating in labor and humbly learning from workers and poor peasants, they have also conducted investigations and research, winning the hearts of the masses.

The Standing Committee of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses," recently sent one-third of its members along with some office workers to factories, rural production teams, and stores for in-depth investigations. While participating in labor and humbly learning from workers and poor peasants, they have conducted thorough investigations and research, discovered, summarized, and promoted typical experiences, guiding the city-wide struggle, criticism, and transformation movement. Through more than twenty days of practice, they have realized that the leaders of the revolutionary committee personally going deep into the grassroots to focus on typical cases is of great significance in promoting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, promoting the revolutionization of the leading cadre, maintaining close ties with the masses, and avoiding bureaucratism.

This measure by the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee was taken after the entire Standing Committee conducted a rectification and inspection of their work. During this rectification, they summarized their work and found that as the city's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved victory after victory, some members had become complacent. In their leadership work, they were satisfied with general calls and were unwilling to go deep into the grassroots to conduct solid investigations and research, thus affecting the progress of various tasks. Everyone agreed that complacency would inevitably lead to detachment from reality and from the masses. To quickly change this situation, they followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on "combining the general with the individual" and "combining leadership with the masses," deciding to adopt a rotation system for the Standing Committee members. One-third of the members would regularly go deep into the grassroots for in-depth investigations and research, discovering, summarizing, and promoting advanced experiences; one-third would go around to understand the situation and help grassroots units solve some problems on the spot; and one-third would stay in the office to handle daily work. According to this decision, the committee chairman and two deputy chairmen, along with three Standing Committee members, led more than twenty office workers to three factories, a suburban people's commune production team, and the Qingdao Food Service Company for in-depth investigations on August 20.

These members of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee who went for in-depth investigations, upon arriving at the grassroots, all adhered to the spirit of being both commanders and fighters, and first of all, being good fighters. They lived, ate, worked, and studied with workers and poor peasants, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, humbly learning from workers and poor peasants, and using every opportunity to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought. Committee Chairman Yang Baohua and military representative, Standing Committee member Yang Yongkai, went to the Four Square Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. They first checked with the factory's revolutionary workers their shortcomings in not going deep into the grassroots and not maintaining close ties with the masses in the recent period, then put on work clothes and worked with the workers. When Yang Baohua labored in the diesel engine workshop, he humbly followed the group leader's arrangements, doing whatever work was assigned, asking workers for help when he didn't know how to do something, insisting on eight hours of shift work, and asking for leave from the group leader when he had to temporarily leave the workshop for something. His living conditions were also the same as the workers'. Deputy Committee Chairman Yang Yunliang led several office workers to the Rubber Factory No. 2. When the factory arranged for them to stay in a guesthouse, they insisted on staying in the workers' collective dormitory. The actions of the committee members were praised by the workers, and many old workers said, "This is a good representative of our working class."

During their in-depth investigations, the Standing Committee members of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "from the masses, to the masses," using methods such as individual chats, discussion meetings, investigation meetings, and home visits to conduct thorough investigations and research, and together with the masses, summarized the advanced experiences of grassroots units in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Yang Baohua and Yang Yongkai, during their investigations and research and labor in the Four Square Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, through dissecting the typical case of the mechanical workshop's third group, which prominently highlighted proletarian politics and brought about profound changes, realized that the team is the forefront of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory, and is the first line of carrying out the revolution and promoting production. Building the team well with Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. They immediately grasped this important issue, working with workers and the factory revolutionary committee to research and summarize the experience of how to build the team with Mao Zedong Thought in the factory during the struggle, criticism, and transformation, setting an example for all industrial and mining enterprises in the city to strengthen team building during the struggle, criticism, and transformation. At the same time, they also summarized the experience of re-educating intellectuals in this factory through investigations and research. The Standing Committee members who went to grassroots units for in-depth investigations, through investigations and research, coordinated with the Standing Committee members who went around, have already summarized some typical experiences in the construction of grassroots revolutionary committees, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the party, and streamlining administration. The typical experiences summarized have already been promoted in the entire city, and some are being prepared for promotion.

    青岛市革委会三分之一的常委深入基层调查研究
    总结典型经验指导全市斗批改
    他们一面参加劳动，虚心向工人和贫下中农学习，一面作调查研究，受到群众的欢迎
    新华社济南二十日电　青岛市革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，最近抽出三分之一的常委带领一部分机关工作人员，分别深入工厂、农村生产队和商店蹲点，一面参加劳动，虚心向工人、贫下中农学习，一面认真进行调查研究，发现、总结和推广典型经验，指导全市正在掀起的斗、批、改高潮。二十多天的实践使他们体会到，革命委员会负责人亲自深入基层抓典型，对推动落实毛主席最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，促进领导班子革命化，密切联系群众，避免官僚主义，都具有重大意义。
    青岛市革命委员会这一措施是在全体常委进行整风检查工作以后采取的。在这次整风中，他们通过总结工作，发现随着全市无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，部分委员产生了骄傲情绪，在领导工作中满足于一般号召，不愿意深入基层做扎扎实实的调查研究工作，因此影响到各项工作不能大踏步前进。大家一致认为，居功自傲就必然要脱离实际、脱离群众。为了迅速改变这种状况，他们遵照毛主席关于“一般和个别相结合”，“领导和群众相结合”的伟大教导，决定采取常委轮换的办法，经常有三分之一的常委深入基层蹲点，进行调查研究，发现、总结和推广先进经验；三分之一的常委跑面，了解情况，就地帮助基层单位解决一些问题；三分之一的常委留守机关，处理日常工作。根据这个决定，革委会主任和两个副主任、三个常委就带领二十多名机关工作人员，于八月二十日分别到三个工厂、一个郊区人民公社的生产队和市饮食服务公司蹲点。
    这批下去蹲点的市革委会负责人，下到基层后，都本着既是指挥员又是战斗员，而首先要当好战斗员的精神，以普通劳动者的身份，和工人、贫下中农同住、同吃、同劳动、同学习，一起斗私批修，虚心向工人、贫下中农学习，并且利用一切时机，大力宣传毛泽东思想。市革委会主任杨保华和军队代表、市革委会常委杨永凯到了四方机车车辆厂，首先向厂里革命职工检查了自己最近一个时期深入基层少、密切联系群众不够的缺点，然后穿上工作服和工人一起干活。杨保华到柴油机车间劳动时，虚心听从组长的分配，叫干什么活就干什么活，不会干的活就虚心向工人请教，坚持八小时跟班劳动，临时有事离开车间，主动向组长请假，生活上也是同工人一样。市革委会副主任杨云良带领几个机关工作人员到橡胶二厂后，厂里安排他们住招待所，他们都坚持住进了工人集体宿舍。革委会成员们的这些行动，受到工人们的称赞，许多老工人说，这才是咱们工人阶级的好代表。
    市革委会常委在蹲点中，遵循毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的伟大教导，采取个别谈心，开座谈会、调查会以及家庭访问等方法，认真进行调查研究，和群众一起总结基层单位搞好斗、批、改的先进经验。杨保华和杨永凯同志在四方机车车辆厂调查研究和劳动过程中，通过解剖客械车间研伐三组突出无产阶级政治，引起深刻变化的典型事例，认识到班组是搞好工厂斗、批、改的前哨，是抓革命、促生产的第一线，用毛泽东思想把班组建设好是个十分重要的问题。他们立即抓住这个重要问题，同工人、厂革委会共同研究，总结出了工厂在斗、批、改中如何用毛泽东思想建设班组的经验，为全市工矿企业在斗、批、改中加强班组建设树立了样板。同时，他们还在这个厂通过调查研究，总结了对知识分子进行再教育的经验。到基层单位蹲点的常委，通过调查研究，同跑面的常委相配合，已经总结出一些关于基层革委会的建设、深入持久地开展革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党和精兵简政等方面的典型经验。总结出的典型经验，有的已在全市推广，有的正准备推广。
