The transformation of worldview is the fundamental transformation — a record of Comrade Long Huafu, a technician at a certain agricultural machinery factory in Tianjin

Long Huafu is a graduate of a technical secondary school who joined a certain agricultural machinery factory in Tianjin in 1961 as a technician. Due to the harm of the bourgeois education system, he spent the past few years sitting in the office, buried in books, copying technical materials. Although he exerted a lot of effort, he achieved nothing in several years. However, when he embarked on the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, the situation changed fundamentally. In just a few months, he and the workers together achieved more than ten technological innovations, seven of which solved some key problems for the entire factory. Long Huafu's experience and transformation prove the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao!

This is a struggle between two lines and two paths

In the process of technological innovation, the successful trial of using electrolysis cutting methods to process important components made the entire workshop and the entire factory buzz with excitement. The workers enthusiastically cheered: This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! Old worker Zhao walked up and firmly shook Long Huafu's hand, saying excitedly, "Seeing your transformation, we are truly happy!" Four hands covered with oil and dirt tightly clasped together... This innovation not only increased efficiency by several times compared to before, but more importantly, people saw from this the broad path of integrating intellectuals with workers and peasants.

Seven years ago, Long Huafu entered the factory from school. Due to the harm of the revisionist educational line, his mind was full of bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth. He wanted to be an "engineer" and an "expert," copying technical materials during work hours and running to the document room after work, always buried in books. The reactionary technical authority "encouraged" him: "Keep working hard, young man, write two books and you'll be famous!" Sometimes he also took a pile of materials to the workshop, but his task was to check if the workers were following the "process," using books to restrict the workers' hands and feet. When workers encountered problems and went to him, he would flip through the materials and look up the data, but he couldn't solve the practical problems. The workers anxiously said, "You can't live without your books?!" In this way, he worked on technology for six years but didn't achieve anything, becoming more and more confused.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept away the decaying forces within the factory. The workers exposed the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," deeply touching Long Huafu's soul. The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team timely absorbed him into the Mao Zedong Thought study class and went to his dormitory to study Chairman Mao's great teachings with him: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually integrates with the broad masses of workers and peasants." They helped him analyze why the reactionary technical "authorities" were so eager to make him walk the bourgeois expert path, and why the workers made such sharp criticisms of his mistakes. This made him deeply realize that this was a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to seize the successors. After his awareness was raised, he decided to go deep into the masses of workers, get his hands dirty, and undergo a thorough transformation. In this way, he resolutely walked into the workshop.

In the workshop, Long Huafu started learning from simple machine operations, humbly listening to the opinions of old workers. Wherever the work was hard, he went there. The selfless spirit of the working class, dedicating everything to the revolution, also deeply infected him. He overcame his previous idea of wanting to do big, difficult, and profound things, and established the idea of starting from production needs and serving the workers everywhere. Once, he worked with a master craftsman. Because the machine was heavy, many components were piled up, affecting the next process. This master craftsman told him his idea of reforming the machine. He followed the master craftsman's advice, working day and night, and drew a rough sketch. But he couldn't calculate some of the data, so he went to find a technician. This technician said, "I don't understand what you drew!" But the master craftsman encouraged him, "Don't ask him, we'll do it ourselves!" They processed piece by piece, not knowing the dimensions, and finally made a brand new "polishing machine," increasing efficiency by several times. This incident deeply educated Long Huafu, making him realize that workers have the most practical experience, and they are much more skilled than those technical "authorities"! After this, he became more determined on the path of integrating with the masses of workers.

The key is to thoroughly transform one's worldview

Comrade Long Huafu's every bit of progress was seen by the workers and remembered in their hearts, and they enthusiastically encouraged him to continue firmly. Long Huafu's enthusiasm for integrating with the workers increased. He and old worker Liu worked together on the trial of electrolysis cutting processing components. Due to the "positioning" problem, several trials failed. At this time, someone gossiped, "Why are you doing this? If it goes wrong, you'll lose face!" Hearing these reflections, Long Huafu wavered, fearing that he would lose face if he failed. Master Liu saw through his thoughts and studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him, recalling bitterness and sweetness together. Long Huafu thought of how before liberation, he was a poor child picking coal. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao cultivated him into a person and made him a technician. He should have listened to Chairman Mao's words, served the people, and contributed to socialist construction; but when encountering difficulties, why couldn't he be as firm as the old workers? After fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism in the study class, he realized that to truly integrate with the masses of workers, he must thoroughly transform his bourgeois worldview. He saw with his own eyes how Master Liu, in order to fix a component, worked two shifts without leaving the machine. The workers' thorough revolutionary spirit deeply educated him, making him finally overcome numerous difficulties and successfully trial the new processing technology. Efficiency increased by more than ten times, and the quality was also higher than before. A large pile of backlogged components was quickly processed, and the production progress of the entire factory was rapidly improved.

Comrade Long Huafu tasted the sweetness of integrating with the workers and peasants on this path, and integrated more closely with the broad masses of workers in his thoughts. In a few months, he achieved more than ten technological innovations. The workers also happily said, "We trust technicians like this!"

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Students from old schools, the majority or a large majority can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some people have made inventions and creations, but they need to be under the correct line leadership, and workers, peasants, and soldiers give them re-education to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's warm instructions have pointed out the direction for the broad masses of intellectuals. The intellectuals and technical personnel in this factory decided to take Long Huafu as an example, sincerely accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transform themselves into a new generation of people who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    世界观的改造是根本的改造
    ——记天津某农具厂技术员龙华富同志
    龙华富同志是中专毕业生，一九六一年进天津某农具厂任技术员。由于资产阶级教育制度的毒害，前几年一直坐在办公室里，钻在书堆里，抄录技术资料，虽然费了老大的劲，几年来却一事无成。但当他走上了与工农群众相结合的道路，情况就发生了根本的变化。短短几个月就和工人们一起搞出了十几项技术革新，其中七项解决了全厂一些关键性的问题。龙华富的经历和变化，证明了伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的无比英明，无比正确！
        这是两条道路、两条路线的斗争
    在技术革新中，用电解切削方法加工重要机件试验成功，使得整个车间整个工厂都沸腾起来了。工人们热烈地欢呼：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！老工人赵师傅走上前去，紧紧握着龙华富的手，激动地说：“看到你的变化，我们真高兴哪！”四只粘满油泥的手紧紧地握在一起了……。这一革新的成功，不仅使功效比原来提高十几倍，更为重要的是，人们从这里看到了知识分子与工农相结合的宽广道路。
    七年前，龙华富从学校走进工厂，由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，满脑子资产阶级名利思想，一心想当“工程师”、“专家”，上班抄录技术资料，下班就往资料室跑，成天钻书本。反动技术权威“鼓励”他：“小伙子好好干，写两本书就出名了！”他有时也抱着一堆资料下车间，但任务是检查工人执行“工艺”的情况，用书本来束缚工人的手脚。工人们遇到问题去找他，他就翻资料、查数据，也解决不了实际问题。工人们着急地说：“你离开书本就不能活了？！”就这样，他搞了六年技术工作，什么也没搞出来，越搞越糊涂。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，冲击着厂内的腐朽势力。工人们揪出了走资派和反动的技木“权威”，也深深地触及了龙华富的灵魂。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队及时地吸收他参加了毛泽东思想学习班，并深入宿舍和他一起学习毛主席的伟大教导：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”帮助他分析反动的技术“权威”为什么那样热衷于让他走资产阶级白专道路；而工人们又为什么对他的错误提出了那样尖锐的批评？使他深切认识到，这是资产阶级和无产阶级争夺接班人的斗争。认识提高后，他决心深入到工人群众中去，滚一身油泥，磨两手茧，来一个脱胎换骨的改造。就这样他坚决地走进了车间。
    在车间里，龙华富从简单的机器操作学起，虚心地倾听老工人的意见，那里工作累，他就到那里去。工人阶级大公无私，一心为革命的精神，也深深地感染了他。他克服了从前一心想搞大、难、深的念头，树立了从生产需要出发，处处为工人服务的思想。一次，他和一位老师傅一起干活，由于机床笨重，积压了好多机件，影响了下道工序。这位老师傅就把自己改革机床的想法告诉他。他就按照老师傅的意见，日夜奋战，刻苦钻研，画出了一张草图。但有些数据他算不出来，就拿去找技师，这位技师说：“你画的是什么，我不理解！”这位老师傅却鼓励他说：“不用问他，我们自己干！”他们一件件地加工，不知道尺寸就加工一件套一件，终于制成了一台崭新的“抛光机”，工效提高了十几倍。这件事深刻教育了龙华富，使他认识到，工人们最有实践经验，他们比那些技术“权威”不知要高明多少！以后，他在与工人群众相结合的道路上，步伐更坚定了。
        关键在于彻底改造世界观
    龙华富同志的点滴进步，工人们看在眼里，记在心上，并热情地鼓励他坚定地走下去。龙华富和工人群众结合的热情更高了。他和老工人刘师傅合作搞电解切削加工机件的试验，由于“定位”问题不能解决，几次试验都失败了。这时有人风言风语地说：“你搞这个干嘛？闹不好出了问题丢人！”听到这些反映，龙华富有些动摇了，怕失败了没脸见人。刘师傅看透了他的心思，就和他一起学习毛主席的教导，并和他一起忆苦思甜。龙华富想到解放前自己是个捡煤核的苦孩子，解放后，党和毛主席把他培养成人，当了技术员，自己本应当听毛主席的话，为人民服务，为社会主义建设出力；可是一遇到困难，怎么就不能象老工人那样坚定呢？经过在学习班里斗私批修，他认识到，要和工人群众真正结合起来，就必须彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观。他亲眼看到刘师傅为了修好一个机件，连干两个班也不愿离开机床，工人们这种彻底革命精神深深地教育了他，使他终于克服了重重困难，把这种崭新的工艺加工试验成功了。工效提高了十多倍，质量也比原来高，一大堆积压的机件很快加工完了，整个工厂的生产进度迅速提高了。
    龙华富同志在与工农群众相结合的道路上尝到了甜头，从思想上和广大工人群众结合得更紧密了。几个月的时间，就搞出了十几项技术革新。工人们也高兴地说：“象这样的技术人员，我们信得过！”
    毛主席最近教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的亲切教导，给广大知识分子指明了前进的方向。这个厂的知识分子和技术人员，决心以龙华富为榜样，老老实实接受工农兵对自己的再教育，把自己改造成为无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一代新人。                       　谭一新
