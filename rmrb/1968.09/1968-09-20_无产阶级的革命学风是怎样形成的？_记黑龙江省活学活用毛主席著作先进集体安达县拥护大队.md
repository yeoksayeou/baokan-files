Our great leader Chairman Mao personally advocated the revolutionary study style of Marxism-Leninism, which is the integration of theory and practice. How can such a revolutionary study style be formed? With this question in mind, we visited the advanced unit in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province.

Since August 1966, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, this brigade has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, leading to a complete transformation from a notorious "old laggard" in the entire county to a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works known throughout the province. Now, the masses are enthusiastically studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the revolutionary criticism and class cleanup work are both vigorous and meticulous. Agricultural production has entered a new phase of great leaps forward. Last year, this brigade achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, selling surplus grain to the state more than double the quota. Although this year encountered a drought, the summer harvest was still good, and the autumn crops are growing well, with the expected total production for the year to catch up with last year. The poor and lower-middle peasants here shared their experiences in establishing and carrying forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao.

Starting with Class Education

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." To establish a proletarian revolutionary study style, one must first correct the attitude towards revolutionary truth.

How to grasp the fundamental attitude towards Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought? The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade have the following experience: start with class education.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade have suffered greatly under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. After liberation, they followed Chairman Mao onto the broad path of socialism with joy in their hearts. However, due to Khrushchev in China's attempts to restore capitalism, he spread "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, leading this brigade astray for a period. At that time, the entire brigade did not have a single book by Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's great voice and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters were blocked layer by layer. This was a profound lesson. When the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade recalled this historical lesson, they were always moved to tears and expressed endless gratitude to Chairman Mao. Therefore, every time they recalled their class bitterness and criticized revisionism, they enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great achievements. In this way, they constantly aroused the deep class feelings of the broad masses to love Chairman Mao limitlessly and strengthened their revolutionary faith in being limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao.

The deep class feelings of limitless love for Chairman Mao and the revolutionary faith of limitless admiration and loyalty to Chairman Mao are a great driving force. It motivates the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works with insatiable thirst and to master Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Not studying Chairman Mao's books is unacceptable!" The active member of the Support Brigade in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, Communist Party member, and blind old poor peasant Zhao Zhenkun, was the first to stand up and rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and was persecuted by class enemies. When the entire brigade held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, he worked day and night to ensure the success of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Zhao Zhenkun said: "Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of us poor and lower-middle peasants. I want to live for making the Support Brigade a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and die for making the Support Brigade a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

During our visit, the poor and lower-middle peasants told us many moving stories similar to Zhao Zhenkun's, of limitless admiration for Chairman Mao and limitless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants understand Chairman Mao's works the fastest, comprehend them the deepest, apply them the most actively, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions the most thoroughly. The key lies in their utmost loyalty to Chairman Mao and their heartfelt love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants told us: The issue of study style is an issue of fundamental attitude and fundamental stance towards Chairman Mao. Whether the study style of Chairman Mao's works is correct or not can only be found in the feelings and attitudes towards Chairman Mao to find the fundamental reason. They said: "Chairman Mao's works are revolutionary treasures, and without class feelings, they cannot be studied well." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade, under the impetus of deep class feelings of limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao like Zhao Zhenkun, carried forward the good study style advocated by Chairman Mao.

The Purpose of Study is to Apply

The most fundamental aspect of the proletarian revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao is the integration of theory and practice. Vice Chairman Lin instructed us to "study with problems in mind, apply actively, integrate learning and application, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' aspect." Some young people in this brigade, after receiving class education, further aroused their class feelings of limitless love for Chairman Mao and thus studied Chairman Mao's works diligently. In a short period, they not only could recite the "Three Articles" and over a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao, but they could also explain the historical background and great significance of some of Chairman Mao's important works in detail. However, due to the influence of the bad study style of the bourgeoisie, they could not use revolutionary theory to guide their revolutionary practice. The poor and lower-middle peasants told them: "Whether you love Chairman Mao or not, whether you are loyal or not, it depends on your actions. We study Chairman Mao's works not to arm our mouths but to arm our minds." They pointed out that to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must integrate learning and application, and apply what one has learned. Thus, the poor and lower-middle peasants guided them to study and apply actively, focusing on the "use" aspect. Later, many young people became active members in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Focusing on the "use" aspect means constantly fighting against selfishness. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade said: The "self" of the bourgeoisie in people's minds is a pest that interferes with the proletarian revolutionary study style and the soil that breeds the bad study style of the bourgeoisie. We cannot play tricks or leave tails with the "self" of the bourgeoisie; otherwise, the proletarian revolutionary study style cannot be sustained, and the bad study style will grow. Female community member Tang Shuxin, in a family self-criticism meeting, did not dare to fight against selfishness thoroughly. Her eleven-year-old daughter helped her say: "One year, after the wheat was harvested, you drove our chickens and chicks into the courtyard to eat collective grain. This is selfishness. With selfishness, you cannot be completely loyal to Chairman Mao and cannot act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Tang Shuxin did not forget this incident and was afraid to expose it for fear of losing face. After her daughter's help, she realized that due to her incomplete self-criticism, the bad study style of the bourgeoisie had grown, and she had not focused enough on the "use" aspect. Therefore, she consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to conduct self-criticism.

Studying Mao Zedong Thought and focusing on the "use" aspect means using Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform one's thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide one's actions, and resolutely following Chairman Mao to make revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "Use" means to follow Chairman Mao resolutely. Therefore, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade, upon hearing the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, acted immediately and implemented them resolutely, ensuring that Chairman Mao's instructions were propagated without delay, implemented without wavering, and executed without discounting. They executed what they understood and also executed what they did not understand, deepening their understanding in the process of execution.

Practicing Serious Self-Criticism

Chairman Mao taught us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad work styles and maintain good work styles." From the situation of the Support Brigade, studying Chairman Mao's works is not something that can be deeply understood and comprehended in one or two sessions, but requires continuous study, and the process of practice, summary, further practice, and further summary. In this process, we must master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, constantly using Chairman Mao's teachings of the "two combined" viewpoint, affirming the good aspects of our active study and application, and negating the bad study style of learning without applying or being free and easy with oneself regarding Marxism-Leninism. Only in this way can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade said: "Only by using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism can we distinguish, in the process of execution, where we have executed resolutely and correctly; where we have deviated in execution. What is correct, we persist in; what is deviated, we correct. Only in this way can we continuously improve our study level and firmly establish a revolutionary good study style."

Chairman Mao taught us: "We should not affirm everything about ourselves, but only affirm the correct things; at the same time, we should not negate everything about ourselves, but only negate the wrong things." He also said: "Do not always think you are right, as if the truth is all in your hands. Do not always think that only you are capable, and others are incapable, as if without you, the earth would not rotate." The brigade leader of the Fourth Production Team, Zhang Xuecai, initially did not understand this truth, and his arrogance grew day by day. This was a clear mistake, and the masses had pointed it out to him many times, but because he lacked serious self-criticism, he could not accept any opinions and instead thought the masses were deliberately opposing him. Consequently, Chairman Mao's instructions could not be executed, and his mistakes could not be corrected. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's profound and sincere teachings, Zhang Xuecai felt that Chairman Mao's words were all directed at him, hitting the mark. He realized that this was not only a manifestation of a bad study style but also a concrete expression of disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, actively sought opinions from the masses who had the most opinions about him, held eight family self-criticism meetings, invited community members to participate, and sincerely conducted self-criticism. In this way, his arrogance decreased, he eliminated the bad study style, maintained the revolutionary good study style, and gradually cultivated the style of being close to the masses.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade deeply felt from their personal experiences: In the great waves of class struggle, many comrades achieved rapid progress and made many achievements. However, whether they can "preserve their youth" and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of thoroughness depends on whether they can conduct serious criticism and self-criticism and dare to "consider oneself wrong" instead of being self-righteous. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade said: "Without the spirit of serious self-criticism, studying Chairman Mao's works will be discounted, and one will be content with the status quo."

Mass Study and Application

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The so-called study style is not only the study style of schools but also the study style of the entire party." When the Support Brigade focused on study style, they always kept their eyes on the masses. From the production team to each family, whether they were cadres, community members, or men, women, and the elderly, they often studied together, inspired each other, helped each other, and taught each other. They also paid great attention to cultivating models. However, as they said: "Our purpose in cultivating models is not for people to visit but to inspire the masses." Therefore, when new models emerged among the masses, they promptly mobilized everyone to summarize and promote them, continuously expanding and strengthening the ranks of active members. In this way, advanced individuals were no longer just a few people, cold and lonely, unable to form a team or revolutionary momentum, but formed a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, surging forward wave after wave. In such an environment, the revolutionary good study style could be carried forward, and the bad study style of learning without applying would be resisted everywhere.

Community member Jia Zhan Shan studied the "Three Articles," and many of the sentences could still be recited, but he was not firm in applying them. Last autumn, he loaded a cart with beet tops in the field, intending to take them home to feed the pigs. When he was loading the cart, he was seen by his second son, who criticized him. The old man sulked and did not speak. Upon entering the village, he encountered his first son, who also stopped him and criticized him for not acting correctly. He had no choice but to take the cart of beet tops back to the team. However, he thought a cart of beet tops was nothing. His thoughts were still not clear. At lunchtime, the whole family criticized him again, and even the little grandson criticized him for taking advantage of the collective, asking him to fight against selfishness. The whole family criticized and helped him for not focusing on the "use" aspect, finally making Jia Zhan Shan realize his mistake.

How to grasp the mass study and application? The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade believe that the key lies in promoting family revolutionization. Since the Support Brigade opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes, it was found that the learning enthusiasm of some cadres and community members was sometimes high and sometimes low, and a large amount of ideological resistance came from the family. "The brigade blows an east wind, and the family blows a west wind." If the family's study style is not correct, it will inevitably affect the brigade's study style not being correct. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the families of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Support Brigade have undergone profound revolutionary changes, transforming the old family relationships of "a thousand mouths in the family, one person in charge." Whoever loves Chairman Mao the most and follows him the closest is respected in the family; whoever studies Chairman Mao's books the best and applies them the best becomes the master of the family. Now, the entire brigade "blows an east wind in the brigade and also blows an east wind in the family," and the revolutionary good study style is thus formed in the Support Brigade.

    无产阶级的革命学风是怎样形成的？
    ——记黑龙江省活学活用毛主席著作先进集体安达县拥护大队
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，就是理论和实际相联系。这样的革命学风怎样才能形成呢？我们带着这个问题，访问了黑龙江省活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体安达县拥护大队。
    这个大队从一九六六年八月在解放军帮助下，举办毛泽东思想学习班以来，发生了天翻地覆的变化，由一个闻名全县的“老落后”，变成了闻名全省的活学活用毛主席著作的典型。现在，群众活学活用毛主席著作蔚然成风，革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，搞得既轰轰烈烈，又深入细致。农业生产出现了大跃进的新局面。去年这个大队获得了空前的大丰收，卖给国家的余粮超过交售任务一倍多；今年虽然遇到了旱灾，但是夏季仍然获得了好收成，秋季作物长势良好，预计全年总产量将赶上去年。这里的贫下中农，向我们介绍了他们树立和发扬毛主席亲自倡导的无产阶级的革命学风的体会。
    从阶级教育入手
    林副主席指示：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”要树立无产阶级的革命学风，首先要端正对革命真理的态度。
    抓对于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根本态度，从何入手？拥护大队贫下中农的体会是，从抓阶级教育入手。
    这个大队的贫下中农，过去饱受了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残酷压迫。解放以后，他们满心喜悦，跟着毛主席走上了社会主义的康庄大道。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫为了在中国复辟资本主义，千方百计向广大贫下中农贩卖“三自一包”、“四大自由”等资本主义黑货，使这个大队走了一段弯路。那时，全大队连一本毛主席的书也没有，毛主席的伟大声音，无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，受到了层层封锁。这是一段深刻的教训。拥护大队的贫下中农在回忆这一段历史教训的时候，总是热泪盈眶，千遍万遍地感激毛主席。因此，他们每忆一次阶级苦，每批判一次修正主义，就热情颂扬毛主席的丰功伟绩。这样，就不断地激发了广大群众无限热爱毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，增强了他们无限忠于毛主席的革命信念。
    对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，对毛主席无限崇拜、无限忠诚的革命信念，是一种巨大的动力。它促使广大贫下中农如饥似渴地去学习毛主席著作，去掌握毛泽东思想。广大贫下中农说：“不读毛主席的书不得了！”拥护大队活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、共产党员、双目失明的老贫农卓振坤，在无产阶级文化大革命中，第一个带头起来造党内一小撮走资派的反，曾受到阶级敌人的迫害。在全大队举办毛泽东思想学习班的时候，他又夜以继日地为办好毛泽东思想学习班而奔忙。卓振坤说：“毛主席的书是咱贫下中农的命根子，毛泽东思想是咱贫下中农的灵魂，我要生为把拥护大队办成毛泽东思想大学校而生，死为把拥护大队办成毛泽东思想大学校而死。”
    在我们访问过程中，贫下中农给我们讲了许多象卓振坤这样无限崇拜毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的动人事例。广大贫下中农为什么对毛主席著作领会得最快，理解得最深，用得最活，对毛主席的指示贯彻得最彻底，关键就在于他们对毛主席最忠诚，打心底里热爱伟大领袖毛主席。贫下中农告诉我们：学风问题，是对毛主席的根本态度、根本立场问题。学习毛主席著作的学风正不正，只有从对毛主席的感情上、态度上去找，才能找到根本原因。他们说：“毛主席著作是革命的宝，没有阶级感情学不好。”拥护大队的广大贫下中农，就是在象卓振坤这样对毛主席无限忠诚的深厚的阶级感情的推动下，发扬了毛主席所倡导的革命的好学风。
    学的目的全在于用
    毛主席亲自倡导的无产阶级的革命学风，最根本的就是理论联系实际。林副主席指示我们“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”这个大队有一部分知识青年，在受了阶级教育以后，进一步激起了对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，因而刻苦学习毛主席著作。在很短的时间内，他们不但能背诵“老三篇”，背诵一百多条毛主席语录，而且对于毛主席的一些重要著作的历史背景、伟大意义，也能讲得头头是道。但是，由于他们受资产阶级坏学风的影响，不能用革命的理论指导自己的革命实践。贫下中农就对他们说：“对毛主席爱不爱，忠不忠，要看行动。我们学习毛主席著作，不是为了武装嘴巴，而是为了武装头脑。”并指出，要忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就要学用一致，学了就用。于是贫下中农就引导他们活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。后来，不少青年成了活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。
    在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是要不断地斗私。拥护大队的贫下中农说：人们头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，是干扰无产阶级的革命学风的害虫，是滋生资产阶级坏学风的土壤。我们对于资产阶级“私”字，不能耍花枪、留尾巴；不然的话，无产阶级的革命学风不能持久，坏学风就会滋长。女社员汤淑琴，在一次家庭斗私会上，不敢彻底地斗私。她的十一岁的女儿就帮助她说：“有一年麦子进场了，你把咱家的母鸡小鸡撵进场院里，吃集体的粮食，这就是私心。有了私心，就不能完全忠于毛主席，就不能照毛主席的指示办事。”汤淑琴并没有忘了这件事，她怕亮出去，丢了名声。经过女儿帮助，她才认识到由于自己斗私不彻底，滋长了资产阶级坏学风，在“用”字上下的功夫还不够，于是，自觉地用毛泽东思想进行了自我批评。
    学习毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫，也就是要用毛泽东思想不断改造自己的思想，用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，坚决跟着毛主席干革命。广大贫下中农深有感触地说：“用，就是要坚决紧跟毛主席。”因此，拥护大队的贫下中农对毛主席的最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一项战斗号令，都是闻风而动，雷厉风行地贯彻执行，做到了宣传毛主席的指示不过夜，落实毛主席的指示坚定不移，执行毛主席的指示不打折扣。理解的执行，不理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。
    实行认真的自我批评
    毛主席教导我们：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”从拥护大队的情况看，学习毛主席著作不是一两次就能深刻领会、深刻理解的，而是需要不断地学习，经过实践、总结、再实践、再总结的过程。在这个过程中，我们要掌握批评和自我批评这个武器，不断地运用毛主席教导我们的“一分为二”的观点，肯定自己活学活用好的方面，否定自己学了不用，或对人马列主义，对己则自由主义的坏学风，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手。拥护大队的贫下中农说：“只有运用批评和自我批评的武器，才能辨别在执行过程中，哪里坚决照办了，做对了；哪里执行时走了样。做对了的，就坚持；走了样的，就改正。这样才能不断提高学习水平，巩固地树立革命的好学风。”
    毛主席教导我们：“不应该肯定我们的一切，只应该肯定正确的东西；同时，也不应该否定我们的一切，只应该否定错误的东西。”又说：“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。”第四生产队队长张学才同志一开始由于不明白这个道理，滋长了骄傲情绪，官气一天天大起来。本来这是明摆着的错误，群众也不止一次地向他批评指出，可就是因为他缺乏认真的自我批评，什么意见也听不进去，相反的认为群众是存心跟自己过不去。因而，毛主席的指示执行不了，自己的错误也就得不到改正。张学才反复学习了毛主席这些深刻而又恳切的教导以后，觉得毛主席的话句句都是给自己说的，击中了要害。他认识到了这不只是沾染了一种坏学风，而且是对毛主席不忠的具体表现。因此，他遵照毛主席的教导，主动到对自己意见最多的群众家里征求意见，连续八次召开了家庭斗私批修会，邀请社员参加，诚恳地作了自我批评。这样，他的官气小了，去掉了不良的学风，保持了革命的好学风，联系群众的作风也就逐渐养成了。
    拥护大队的贫下中农从切身的经历中，深刻体会到：在阶级斗争的大风浪中，许多同志得到很快的提高，取得不少成绩。但是，能不能“永葆青春”，发扬革命的彻底精神，关键在于能不能进行认真的批评和自我批评，勇于“自以为非”，而不是自以为是。拥护大队的贫下中农说：“没有认真的自我批评精神，学习毛主席著作就会打折扣，就会故步自封。”
    群众性的学与用
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“所谓学风，不但是学校的学风，而且是全党的学风。”拥护大队在抓学风时，总是把着眼点放在群众身上。从生产队到每个家庭，无论是干部、社员，还是男女老少，经常在一起学习，互相启发，互相帮助，互教互学。他们也十分注意培养典型。但是，正如他们讲的：“我们培养典型的目的，不是为了供人参观，而是为了带动群众。”因此，群众中出现了新的典型，他们就及时发动大家加以总结、推广，使积极分子队伍不断发展壮大。这样，先进人物就不总是少数几个人，冷冷清清，形成不了队伍，形成不了革命声势，而是形成了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的运动，一浪高似一浪地向前发展。在这样的环境中，活学活用的革命好学风就能得到发扬，学了不用的坏学风就会处处受到抵制。
    社员贾占山学了“老三篇”，其中不少警句还能背诵，可就是用起来不过硬。去年秋天，他在地里装了一车甜菜缨子，打算拉回家去喂猪。他正装车的时候，被二儿子看见了，二儿子就批评他。老头子赌气不吭。一进屯又碰见了大儿子，大儿子又拦住他的路，批评他不应该这样作，他只好把一车甜菜缨子拉到队里。但是，他觉得一车菜缨子算不了什么。思想仍旧不通。中午吃饭时，全家又对他进行了批评，连小孙子也批评他占集体便宜是不对的，要他斗私。全家人对他不在“用”字上下功夫，进行了批评和帮助，终于使贾占山认识了错误。
    怎样才能抓好群众性的学与用呢？拥护大队贫下中农认为，关键在于搞好家庭革命化。拥护大队开办毛泽东思想学习班以来，发现有些干部和社员的学习情绪时高时低，其中大量的思想阻力是来自家庭。“队里刮东风，家里刮西风”，家庭的学风不正，必然影响队里的学风不正。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，拥护大队贫下中农的家庭都发生了深刻的革命变革，改变了过去“家有千口，主事一人”的旧家庭关系。谁对毛主席爱得最深，跟得最紧，谁在家庭中就受到尊重；谁对毛主席的书学得最好，用得最好，谁就成为家庭中的主人。现在，全队“队里刮东风，家里也刮东风”，革命的好学风就是这样在拥护大队形成的。　本报记者
