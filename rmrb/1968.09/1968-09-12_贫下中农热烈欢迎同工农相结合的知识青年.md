	Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Warmly Welcome Knowledge Youth Who Combine with Workers and Peasants

	Editor:

	The editorial note and investigative report titled "From the Struggle Between Two Lines in Shanghai Mechanical Institute to the Educational Revolution in Technical and Engineering Universities" in the *Red Flag* magazine convey the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, and it speaks to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

	For many years, batch after batch of knowledge youth have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, with the ambition and resolve to revolutionize their worldview and work in the countryside for life. They have come to us poor and lower-middle peasants with great joy, wholeheartedly following the path of combining with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed. This is a matter of great importance for preventing and opposing revisionism. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the revolutionary actions of the knowledge youth and warmly welcome those who combine with workers and peasants.

	In 1964, our brigade also received a batch of knowledge youth. In the three great revolutionary movements, the majority of them listened to Chairman Mao's words and combined with the poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants also like them very much. We study Chairman Mao's works together with them, raise our political consciousness together; we labor together, teaching them the knowledge of production struggle; we recall bitterness and think of sweetness together, raising their class struggle consciousness; we criticize together the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "study to be an official" and "go to the countryside to be an official" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev, raising their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines.

	In actual struggle, these youths have grown rapidly. Some have become active elements in applying Chairman Mao's thoughts in practice, some have taken a clear stand in class struggle and fought fiercely, and some have already become skilled workers in production. Knowledge youth can only become "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" by following the path of combining with workers and peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants see them grow and happily say: "The path indicated by Chairman Mao is correct. We poor and lower-middle peasants' batons will not be passed to the wrong hands!"

	Chairman Mao has entrusted a batch of knowledge youth to us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the greatest trust and encouragement to us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is our greatest honor. To lead this new force on the agricultural front with Mao Zedong Thought and cultivate them into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause is our sacred duty. We poor and lower-middle peasants will surely accomplish the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants hope that all knowledge youth who are willing to revolutionize will follow the path of combining with workers and peasants, and express their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao with actual actions.

    贫下中农热烈欢迎同工农相结合的知识青年
    编辑同志：
    《红旗》杂志极其重要的编者按和调查报告《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，说到了咱贫下中农的心坎上。
    多年来，一批又一批的知识青年，响应毛主席的伟大号召，怀着在农村干一辈子革命，彻底改造世界观的雄心壮志，高兴地来到咱贫下中农中间，一心一意地走毛主席他老人家指引的和工农相结合的道路，咱贫下中农高兴极了。因为这是反修、防修的千年大计、万年大计。我们贫下中农坚决支持知识青年的革命行动，热烈欢迎和工农相结合的知识青年。
    一九六四年，我们大队也来了一批知识青年，在三大革命运动中，他们中的绝大多数人，都能听毛主席的话，和贫下中农相结合。我们贫下中农也非常喜欢他们，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，共同提高政治觉悟；和他们一起劳动，教给他们生产斗争知识；和他们一起忆苦思甜，提高他们的阶级斗争觉悟；和他们一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“三自一包”“四大自由”和用来腐蚀青年的“读书做官”“下乡做官”等反革命修正主义谬论，提高他们的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    在实际斗争中，这些青年成长得很快，有的成了活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，有的在阶级斗争中，立场鲜明，猛打猛冲，有的在生产上已经开始成为能手。知识青年只有走与工农相结合的道路，才能成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。我们贫下中农看到他们成长，非常高兴地说：“毛主席指的路就是正确，我们贫下中农手中的印把子，不愁没人接了！”
    毛主席他老人家把一大批知识青年交给我们贫下中农，这是对我们贫下中农最大的信任，最大的鼓舞，也是我们广大贫下中农无上的光荣。用毛泽东思想带好这支农业战线上的新兵，培养他们成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是咱贫下中农神圣的职责。我们贫下中农坚决完成毛主席他老人家交给的光荣任务。
    我们贫下中农希望一切愿意革命的知识分子，走和工农相结合的道路，以实际行动表达对毛主席他老人家的无限忠诚。
