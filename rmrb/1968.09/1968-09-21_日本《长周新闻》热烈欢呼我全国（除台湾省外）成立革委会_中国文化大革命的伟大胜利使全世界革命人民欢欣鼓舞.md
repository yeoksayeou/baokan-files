Japanese "Long Week News" Warmly Celebrates the Establishment of Revolutionary Committees Across China (Excluding Taiwan Province)
The Great Victory of China's Cultural Revolution Inspires Joy Among Revolutionary People Worldwide

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, a message from Tokyo: On the 15th, the Japanese "Long Week News" published an editorial warmly celebrating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province).

The editorial stated that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) is not only a first in Chinese history but also a pioneering achievement in human history.

The editorial said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has thoroughly defeated the Chinese Khrushchev who infiltrated the organs of the Chinese proletarian dictatorship, attempting to transform proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and socialism into capitalism. It further consolidated the proletarian dictatorship. This thoroughly shattered the delusions of imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique, as well as the reactionaries of various countries, making all revolutionary people around the world feel elated and inspired.

The editorial said that the U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism attempt to divide and dominate the world between the two superpowers, but this will only accelerate their disintegration and collapse.

The editorial pointed out that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, China has become an indestructible stronghold and the most reliable backbone for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, including the Japanese people.

The editorial said that the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will undoubtedly inspire the Japanese people to bravely fight against the rule of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and against Soviet revisionism and the Rybun group.
