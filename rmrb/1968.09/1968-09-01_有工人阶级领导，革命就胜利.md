In socialist industrial enterprises, should we rely on the working class or a handful of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities"? Should the working class lead everything, or should the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" lead everything? This is a crucial issue in determining whether proletarian dictatorship or bourgeois dictatorship is implemented in industrial enterprises.

Our country is a proletarian dictatorship, and the working class must lead everything. Factories and enterprises are where the working class is most concentrated, and all power should firmly be in the hands of the working class. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan have consistently stood on a bourgeois reactionary position, fiercely resisting the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "wholeheartedly rely on the working class," opposing workers' participation in enterprise management, opposing the launch of mass movements, suppressing the socialist enthusiasm of the worker masses, and vigorously advocating for "expert-led factories," relying on a few "authorities" to control the power of the enterprises, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the working class.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution," "the entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad working class of Anshan has liberated their minds, dispelled superstitions, dared to revolutionize, dared to win, and unleashed boundless wisdom and strength, promoting the continuous leapfrog development of steel production. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan extremely detest the revolutionary mass movements of the working class, claiming that workers managing factories "cause production disorder," and "enterprise management is already in chaos." They repeatedly emphasize the need to establish some "normal order."

What is the "normal order" that the Chinese Khrushchev yearns for, fantasizes about, and pursues? Unveiled, it is the "expert-led factory" junk picked up from revisionism, that is, from the bourgeoisie. They implement the "chief engineer system" and "chief accountant system" in socialist industrial enterprises. Under the slogan of "expert-led factories," they bring in various types of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" and various spies and traitors under their command, monopolizing the production, technical, and financial powers of the enterprises, and implementing "control, restrict, deduct, and suppress" over the broad masses of workers. They want "experts to think, workers to act, experts to make laws, workers to follow laws," and do not allow workers to step over the line.

When the broad masses of workers rise up under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against them, break through their old frameworks, and launch a technical revolution, they always shake their heads and say this is not allowed, that is not allowed. When workers engage in modern smelting technology, they say, "clumsy hands can't do it." When workers, based on practical experience, operate on those backward "foreign equipment" and "foreign techniques," they say, "you can't touch the Buddha's eyes." When workers use local methods and old materials to launch a technical revolution, they say, "chicken feathers can't fly to the sky." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan are so extremely hostile to the revolutionary mass movements, stubbornly pushing the "expert-led factory" system, with the purpose of letting the "experts" and "authorities" control the business and technical powers, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the broad working class.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. "Never before has a mass movement been launched so broadly and deeply." The broad working class, with the "Anshan Constitution" as a sharp ideological weapon, has raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashed the revisionist line of managing enterprises with "expert-led factories" pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, and overturned the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie and the regulations that hinder the development of productive forces. Using revolution to lead production, launching mass movements, the masses have unleashed tremendous socialist revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity. Since this year, the production levels of various factories and mines in Anshan have continuously risen, and the output of major products such as pig iron, steel ingots, steel, and metallurgical coke has increased significantly, creating more than a dozen records of the highest production since the start of operations. New technologies and techniques continue to emerge in various factories and mines. The revolutionary workers of the First Steel Plant have carried forward the great, unyielding revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, discarded the foreign frameworks, kicked away the shackles of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," and created the latest record of high-speed, high-quality steel smelting. The revolutionary workers of the Cherry Orchard Iron Mine, in a large-scale underground blasting, thoroughly smashed the old rules of a few people conducting scientific experiments behind closed doors, insisted on launching mass movements, and increased the ore recovery rate from the original 50% to over 80%. The revolutionary workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant have launched a technical revolution and successfully produced the cutting-edge product of alloy steel tube hot rolling. "Never before have the people been so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor." The working class managing factories is excellent, excellent! The working class must lead everything!

    有工人阶级领导，革命就胜利
    安革伟
    在社会主义工业企业中，是依靠工人阶级，还是依靠少数资产阶级“专家”、“权威”？是工人阶级领导一切，还是资产阶级“专家”、“权威”领导一切？这是在工业企业中实行无产阶级专政还是实行资产阶级专政的重要问题。
    我国是无产阶级专政的国家，工人阶级必须领导一切。工厂企业，是工人阶级最集中的地方，一切大权都应当牢牢掌握在工人阶级手中。然而，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人一贯站在资产阶级反动立场上，疯狂地抵制伟大领袖毛主席关于“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”的指示，反对工人参加企业管理，反对大搞群众运动，扼杀工人群众的社会主义积极性，拚命鼓吹“专家治厂”，依靠少数“权威”掌握企业大权，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们说：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量”，“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”鞍山广大工人阶级在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，解放思想，破除迷信，敢于革命，敢于胜利，发挥了无穷的智慧和力量，促进了钢铁生产的持续飞跃发展。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人极端仇视工人阶级的革命群众运动，胡说什么工人阶级管理工厂“造成生产秩序混乱”，“企业管理乱的已经一塌糊涂”。他们一再强调要建立什么“正常秩序”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所迷恋、幻想、追求的“正常秩序”是什么货色呢？拆穿了就是从修正主义也就是资产阶级那里拣来的“专家治厂”的破烂。他们在社会主义工业企业里大搞“总工程师制”、“总会计师制”。在“专家治厂”的口号下，把各种各样的资产阶级反动技术“权威”，形形色色的特务、叛徒纳入自己的麾下，独揽企业生产、技术、财务大权，对广大工人实行“管、卡、扣、压”。他们要“专家动脑，工人动手，专家立法，工人守法”，不许工人越过雷池一步。
    当广大工人在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下起来和他们进行斗争，冲破他们的旧“框框”，大闹技术革命的时候，他们又总是摇头摆尾地说这也不行，那也不行。工人搞现代冶炼技术，他们说：“笨手笨脚搞不成”。工人根据实践经验给那些落后的“洋设备”、“洋工艺”动手术，他们说：“佛爷眼珠碰不得”。工人用土办法、旧材料闹技术革命，他们说：“鸡毛飞不上天”。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人如此极端仇视革命群众运动，顽固推行“专家治厂”，目的就是要“专家”、“权威”把持业务、技术大权，对广大工人阶级实行资产阶级专政。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的丧钟。“从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”广大工人阶级以“鞍钢宪法”为锐利的思想武器，高举革命批判旗帜，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人推行的“专家治厂”的修正主义办企业路线，大造资产阶级反动技术“权威”和阻碍生产力发展的规章制度的反，用革命统帅生产，大搞群众运动，群众中就迸发出巨大的社会主义革命的积极性和创造性。今年以来，鞍钢各厂矿生产水平节节上升，生铁、钢锭、钢材和冶金焦等主要产品的产量都有较大幅度的提高，并创造了开工以来最高纪录十余项。各厂矿不断出现新工艺、新技术。第一炼钢厂革命职工，发扬无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，甩掉洋框框，踢开资产阶级反动技术“权威”的束缚，创造了快速度炼优质钢的最新纪录。樱桃园铁矿革命职工，在一次大规模井下爆破中，彻底砸烂了过去少数人关门搞科学试验的陈规旧章，坚持大搞群众运动，矿石回收率由原来百分之五十提高到百分之八十以上。无缝钢管厂革命职工，大搞技术革命，试制生产了合金钢管热轧成功的尖端产品。“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”工人阶级管理工厂好得很，好极了！工人阶级就是要领导一切！
