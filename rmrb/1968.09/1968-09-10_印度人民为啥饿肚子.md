India has been facing severe food shortages year after year, and this year's shortage is even more critical. Millions of Indian farmers are eating tree bark and grass roots, with many starving to death and the survivors tightening their belts. This is clearly the result of India's dark and corrupt social system, but the Indian government blames it on "drought," attributing the people's hunger to natural conditions.

In reality, India's natural conditions are quite good. In the northeast, there is the Ganges River. The vast alluvial plains of the Ganges are very fertile. The lower Ganges region of West Bengal and the western region, which Western academic "authorities" call "prosperous Bengal," are particularly fertile. Assam receives an average of 12,000 millimeters of rain per year, making it one of the world's wettest regions. It is strange that these two fertile regions, West Bengal and Assam, are experiencing the most severe food shortages. The Indian Minister of State for Food and Agriculture, Hind, admitted that India's climate conditions this year are good. This inadvertently slaps the lying Indian reactionary government in the face.

As for natural conditions, Lankao is much worse off than India. Lankao County is located in the eastern plains of Henan, in the heart of the old Yellow River course, with old levees and old riverbeds crisscrossing the entire region. After floods, the land is either sandy or salty, with very little fertile soil. Historically, these natural conditions have brought three disasters to the people of Lankao: wind, salt, and waterlogging. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Lankao have been planting trees to prevent sandstorms, digging rivers to drain water, and treating salt-alkali soil, rapidly changing the natural landscape of Lankao. Now, the population of Lankao has increased from 290,000 before liberation to 380,000, the arable land area has expanded from 900,000 mu to 1,160,000 mu, and agricultural production has increased significantly. The total grain output has increased from 90 million jin before liberation to 170 million jin, transforming Lankao from a severely grain-deficient county to a self-sufficient one.

In Lankao, the sky is the same sky, the land is the same land, and the people are the same people. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the spiritual outlook of the people of Lankao has undergone a fundamental change. The land is cultivated by people, and things are done by people. The people of Lankao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have shown boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, fighting against nature and the land, creating a new world in Lankao. Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the political situation was dark, and bandits were as numerous as flies. They seized cattle and people, conscripted soldiers, and seized grain, forcing the people to flee their homes and leaving the fields barren. In normal years, 200,000 to 400,000 mu of crops would fail, and two-thirds of the population, about 200,000 people, would go hungry. The bureaucrats of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government were busy every day with promotions and making money, scheming and backstabbing, skinning the land and drinking the people's blood. How could they think of controlling sand, salt, and waterlogging? The ruling party in India today, the Congress Party, is exactly the same as the old Kuomintang of China.

The brutal exploitation and oppression of the broad Indian people by imperialism and the Indian reactionaries have caused deep national disasters. A few people, relying on their power, have seized most of the country's arable land and caused large areas of land to be abandoned. They issue 30 billion rupees in high-interest loans every year and, through other debts, ruthlessly exploit the Indian people. They sell themselves to American imperialism, inviting the wolf into the house, allowing the Americans to plunder Indian resources at will. The fundamental cause of India's food shortages is not some "drought," but the evil rule of imperialism and the Indian reactionaries. These bloodsuckers of the Indian people not only cause severe food shortages in India but also delight in maintaining them. American imperialism hopes to maintain India's food shortages to keep India dependent on American grain, so that it can control and enslave India.

To fundamentally solve the problem of food, the Indian people must rise up under the leadership of a genuine Communist Party, overthrow the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that weigh on their heads, and succeed. The Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek, liberated all of China, and made the working people the masters of the state. However, the enemy is not willing to admit defeat. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, attempt to restore capitalism in China, making us take a step backward and suffer twice. Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the enemy's plot to restore power, and we have preserved our proletarian iron fortress. Now, the Chinese people, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, are carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end to ensure that our country remains unchanged. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, use our own hands to build our socialist motherland into an even stronger and more prosperous country, improve the lives of the working people, and better support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

The Indian people are a hardworking and wise people, and they all have two hands. It is just that under the rule of American imperialism and the Indian reactionaries, these hands are temporarily bound. Once the Indian people rise up to overthrow the cannibalistic social system and strive for complete liberation, they will not only be able to solve their food problems but will definitely be able to build India into a prosperous and strong new country for the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various reactionaries' persecution of the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The revolutionary flames of the Nasalbari peasant struggle, which ignited last January, are spreading across the Indian land. Their struggle points the way forward for the Indian people. The people of Lankao deeply sympathize with the Indian people and firmly support their struggle. We believe that the broad laboring masses of India will one day break the shackles on their bodies, end the evil rule of the American-Indian reactionaries, and welcome a bright future.

    印度人民为啥饿肚子
    兰考县革命委员会主任　张钦礼
    印度连年闹粮荒，今年的粮荒更严重。千百万印度农民啃树皮，吃草根，饿死的饿死，活着的勒紧裤带。这明明是印度黑暗腐败的社会制度造成的，印度政府却说是因为“旱灾”，把人民挨饿的原因归结到自然条件上。
    其实，印度的自然条件是很好的。印度东北有条恒河。恒河平原的广大冲积地带，十分肥沃。恒河下游的西孟加拉，西方的学术“权威”称它为“富饶的孟加拉”。阿萨姆邦每年降水量一万二千毫米，是世界上雨水最丰富的地区之一。说来奇怪，偏偏这两个富饶的西孟加拉和阿萨姆邦，粮荒却闹得特别严重。印度的粮食和农业部国务部长欣德承认，今年印度的气候条件是好的。这就无意中给撒谎的印度反动当局打了一个嘴巴。
    要说自然条件，我们兰考可比印度差多了。兰考县位于河南东部平原、黄河故道中心，废堤故道交织全境。洪水过后，不是沙荒，便是盐碱河坡，淤土很少。历史上形成的自然条件给兰考人民带来了三个灾害：风沙、盐碱和内涝。解放以后，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，兰考人民造林防沙，挖河排涝，治理盐碱，迅速改变着兰考的自然面貌。现在，兰考人口从解放前的二十九万增至三十八万，耕地面积从九十多万亩扩展到一百一十六万亩，农产品大幅度增加，粮食总产量则由解放时的九千万斤增至一亿七千万斤，全县从严重缺粮变为自给有余。
    在兰考，天是同样的天，地是同样的地，人还是兰考的人。解放后，由于有了共产党和毛主席的英明领导，兰考人民的精神面貌发生了根本的变化。地在人种，事在人为。用毛泽东思想武装起来的兰考人民发挥冲天的革命干劲，与天斗，与地斗，使兰考出现了一个崭新的天地。解放前，在国民党反动派的统治下，政治黑暗，土匪多如牛毛，拉牛架户，抓兵抢粮，逼得人民离乡背井，田园荒芜。一般年景，每年有二十万至四十万亩庄稼颗粒无收，全县三分之二的人口，约二十万人民饿肚子。蒋介石反动政府的官僚们天天忙着升官发财，勾心斗角，刮地皮，喝民血，哪里会想到治理沙、碱、涝呢？现在的印度执政党——国大党跟旧中国的国民党完全是一路货。
    帝国主义和印度反动派对广大印度人民的残酷剥削和压迫，造成了印度深重的民族灾难。他们少数人依仗权势，霸占了全国大部分的耕地，并使土地大量丢荒。他们每年发放三百亿卢比的高利贷，并通过其他债务盘剥，极力压榨印度人民。他们卖身投靠美帝国主义，引狼入室，让美帝恣意掠夺印度资源。印度粮荒的根本原因，决不是什么“旱灾”，而是帝国主义和印度反动派的罪恶统治。这些印度人民的吸血鬼不仅造成了印度严重的粮荒，并且还乐于保持粮荒。美帝国主义希望保持印度的粮荒，是为了保持印度对美国粮食的依赖，以便它控制和奴役印度。
    印度人民要根本解决吃饭问题，只有在真正的共产党的领导下，起来革命，推翻压在他们头上的三座大山，即帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，才能成功。中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席领导全中国人民推翻了国民党蒋介石的反动统治，解放了全中国，劳动人民成了国家的主人。但是，敌人是不甘心失败的。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派妄图在中国复辟资本主义，叫我们走回头路，吃二遍苦。我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了阶级敌人的复辟阴谋，使我们保住了无产阶级的铁打江山。现在，中国人民正在我们伟大的领袖毛主席的率领下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以便永远保持我们的国家不变颜色。我们要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用我们自己的双手，把我们的社会主义祖国建设得更加富强，使劳动人民的生活变得更加美好，使我们能够更好地支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    印度人民是勤劳智慧的人民，他们也都有一双手。只是在美帝和印度反动派的统治下，这双手暂时还被束缚着。印度人民一旦起来推翻吃人的社会制度，争取彻底解放，就不仅能够解决他们的吃饭问题，而且一定能够把印度建设成为一个繁荣富强的人民的新国家。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。去年一月点起的纳萨尔巴里农民斗争的革命烈火，正在印度大地上蔓延开来。他们的斗争给印度人民指出了前进的方向。我们兰考人民深切同情印度人民，坚定地支持他们的斗争。我们相信，印度广大劳动人民总有一天会打碎他们身上的枷锁，结束美印反动派的罪恶统治，迎接光明的未来。
