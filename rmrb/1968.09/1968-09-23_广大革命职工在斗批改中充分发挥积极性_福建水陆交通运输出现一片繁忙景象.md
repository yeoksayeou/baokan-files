The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fully bringing into play the leading role of the working class have inspired the revolutionary workers on the transportation front in Fujian Province. They are vigorously carrying out the revolution and vigorously promoting production, and the water and land transportation in the whole province is bustling with activity.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary workers in the transportation departments of Fujian Province have followed Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." While criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "profit in command" pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents, they have thoroughly criticized and abolished unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the workers' hands and feet and suppress the revolutionary initiative of the workers, thereby further liberating the productive forces. The stevedores at Mazui Port in Fuzhou, in the course of the revolutionary criticism, put emphasis on reform, abolished the old regulations that required goods unloaded from ships to be weighed, stored, and then allocated, and established a new system of direct allocation from the ships. This not only accelerated the turnover of ships but also ensured the transportation of materials urgently needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihood. Due to the vigorous struggle, criticism, and transformation, maritime transportation in the whole province has also been improving. In the first half of this year, the volume of cargo handled at various ports exceeded the original plan and increased several times over the same period last year.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." In May, the Fuzhou area experienced a rare mountain flood in recent years, posing a serious threat to the railway. Revolutionary railway workers immediately joined the anti-flood battle. Together with the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who guarded the railway day and night, and the revolutionary workers and peasants of the public road engineering teams and rural people's communes, they ensured the smooth flow of railway transportation. In August, the volume of railway freight reached the highest level of the year, increasing by 18.2% over July and by 76% over the same period last year. The revolutionary workers at the Zhangzhou Motor Transport Station, which is at the junction of highways, railways, and waterways, as well as the revolutionary workers at the motor transport stations in Longyan in western Fujian and Fu'an in eastern Fujian, after achieving revolutionary great unity, quickly established a new order of revolutionary production, effectively promoting transportation production.

At present, the revolutionary workers on the railway, highway, maritime, and inland waterways such as Minjiang and Jiulongjiang in Fujian Province are further bringing into play the huge role of the comprehensive water and land transportation network of the province, with the Yantai-Xiamen and Nanping-Fuzhou railways as the backbone. They are ensuring the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and promoting the vigorous development of the cause of socialist construction.

    广大革命职工在斗批改中充分发挥积极性
    福建水陆交通运输出现一片繁忙景象
    新华社福州二十日电  伟大领袖毛主席关于充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的最新指示，鼓舞着福建省交通运输战线的广大革命职工，他们狠抓革命，猛促生产，全省水、陆交通运输出现了一片繁忙景象。
    无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段以来，福建省交通运输部门的革命职工，遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，在批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“利润挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货的同时，大破束缚工人手脚、压制工人革命积极性的不合理的规章制度，进一步解放了生产力。福州马尾港的装卸工人，在革命大批判中，破字当头，改革了过去从货轮卸下的物资要先过磅、进仓，再调拨的旧规章制度，建立了直接从货轮调拨的新制度，既加速了船只的周转，又保证了工农业生产和人民生活急需物资的运输。由于狠抓斗、批、改，全省的海上运输也搞得越来越好。今年上半年，各港口进、出口的货运量都超过了原计划，比去年同期更是成倍增长。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”今年五月间，福州地区遇到了近年来少有的山洪，铁路受到严重威胁。革命的铁路职工马上投入抗洪战斗。他们在日夜巡守铁路线的人民解放军指战员和公路工程队革命工人、农村人民公社社员的协同下，确保了铁路运输畅通无阻。八月份的铁路货运量达到了今年以来的最高水平，比七月份增长百分之十八点二，比去年同期增长百分之七十六。地处公路、铁路、水运衔接中心点的漳州汽车运输总站以及闽西的龙岩、闽东的福安等地区汽车运输总站的广大革命职工，在实现了革命大联合后，迅速建立了革命生产新秩序，有力的促进了运输生产。
    目前，福建省铁路、公路、海运和闽江、九龙江等内河交通运输线上的广大革命职工，正在进一步发挥以鹰（潭）厦（门）、南（平）福（州）铁路为骨干组成的全省水陆交通运输网的巨大作用，保证城乡物资交流，促进社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展。
