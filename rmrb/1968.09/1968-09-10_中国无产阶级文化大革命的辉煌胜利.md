	Albanian People's Voice Newspaper Publishes Editorial Warmly Congratulating the Establishment of Revolutionary Committees in All Provinces, Municipalities, and Autonomous Regions in China (except Taiwan Province)

	The victory of the Cultural Revolution is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought, and it is also a victory for the revolutionary people of the world. It greatly encourages the revolutionary people of various countries and deals a fatal blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 9 - The Albanian newspaper People's Voice published an editorial on September 8 titled "The Brilliant Victory of the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution," warmly congratulating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China (except Taiwan Province). The full text of the editorial is as follows:

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved another brilliant victory: on September 5, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as well as the cities of Lhasa and Urumqi, established revolutionary committees. With this, all of China has established organs of proletarian dictatorship—the revolutionary committees. Now, from the northernmost Heilongjiang Province to the southernmost Hainan Island (except Taiwan Province), the victorious red flag of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is flying high.

	This is a brilliant victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's correct Marxist-Leninist line, a brilliant victory of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary strategy and tactics. It has smashed the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and other enemies of the Chinese people who were trying to restore capitalism in China. This is a victory for socialism and proletarian dictatorship in China. This victory and the devastating blow to the revisionist conspirators, traitors, and domestic counter-revolutionaries have shattered the aggressive anti-China plans of the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and other reactionaries. This victory has brought joy to hundreds of millions of Chinese people and inspired them to continue advancing and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched in the People's Republic of China, more than two years have passed. Throughout the entire process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, initiated, decided, and directed by Comrade Mao Zedong and led by the vanguard of the proletariat—the Chinese Communist Party, tens of millions of revolutionary masses, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and intellectuals have wholeheartedly supported Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought.

	The combination of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres of party and government organs—this is the foundation for the establishment of revolutionary committees, and it has been unprecedentedly consolidated. The new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China marks that the entire movement has entered the stage of struggle-criticism-transformation nationwide. In this period, a fatal blow is being dealt to the decaying old world. The remnants and influences of the bourgeoisie and revisionist ideology are being eliminated. Tens of millions of revolutionary masses loyal to Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line are destroying the last strongholds of the Chinese Khrushchev clique, the Chiang Kai-shek agents, and various reactionaries in different parts of China. The establishment of revolutionary committees throughout China is a powerful and fatal blow to imperialism, revisionism, and international reactionaries, completely shattering all their evil schemes. The dreams, plans, and conspiracies of the imperialists led by the United States and the revisionists led by the Soviet Union to restore capitalism in China have all been shattered. Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "No force in the world can stop the 700 million Chinese people from advancing along the road of socialism and communism. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will cleanse China of the Khrushchevs and turn the beautiful dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has set a great example for overthrowing the revisionist cliques in power in various parts of the world. The People's Republic of China will forever be an impregnable fortress of socialism and a powerful base for revolution. The Chinese Communist Party will forever be the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism."

	In recent weeks, Comrade Mao Zedong has issued new instructions on the role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, emphasizing the decisive role of the working class in socialist construction. These instructions have inspired great optimism and revolutionary enthusiasm in various parts of China, further promoting the proletarian revolution on the production front, determining the leading role of the working class in education and culture, and further consolidating the position of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian dictatorship in the People's Republic of China. Comrade Mao Zedong, in summing up the experience of the revolutionary struggle of the great Chinese people, pointed out: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution has proven that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." In his latest instructions, he said: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in the struggle." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the proletarian revolution in education and all other work, thus powerfully promoting the proletarian cultural revolution in China and accelerating the final victory in the struggle against a small handful of revisionist traitors who once held leading positions in the party and the state and attempted to restore capitalism in China.

	In the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the creative power of the brilliant Chinese people has erupted with unprecedented vigor. The working class, which has rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements—class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation—supports and unreservedly follows Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, implements the party's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production," and the great principles of self-reliance and emphasizing proletarian policies. In various sectors of the national economy, as well as in science and technology, education, and culture, new brilliant victories have been achieved.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great People's Republic of China has achieved comprehensive victories in revolution and production, resisting all enemies at home and abroad. The People's Republic of China has become a very powerful socialist country, with modern industry, advanced agriculture, proletarian education and culture, scientific and technological achievements reaching the world's peak, and a strong defensive force with all necessary weapons for defense, including atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs, dealing heavy blows to all aggressors and their alliances that dare to provoke the People's Republic of China.

	The brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong's correct Marxist-Leninist line have enhanced the international prestige of the People's Republic of China. Today, the great People's Republic of China has become a true socialist giant, an impregnable fortress of socialism and revolution, standing firmly in the face of imperialist and revisionist enemies. For all revolutionaries, Marxist-Leninists, and people around the world who are fighting for national and social liberation, China has become their reliable pillar, infinite hope, and great inspiration, while for imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, China causes them to tremble with fear.

	The Albanian people and Albanian communists are overjoyed and extend their heartfelt congratulations for the new, great, and brilliant victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These victories are victories of the proletarian revolutionary line and Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought. At the same time, these victories are also our victories, the victories of Marxism-Leninism, and the victories of the revolutionary people of the world. These victories inspire all progressive people and revolutionary forces around the world to fight against the enemies of freedom, revolution, and socialism of the people of various countries, to fight against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists.

    阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈祝贺我国（除台湾省外）省、市、自治区革命委员会全部成立
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利
    文化大革命的胜利是毛主席的马列主义思想的光辉胜利，也是世界革命人民的胜利。它极大地鼓舞了各国革命人民，给帝修反以致命的打击
    新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八日发表题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利》的社论，热烈祝贺中国全国（除台湾省外）各省、市、自治区革命委员会全部成立。社论全文如下：
    由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命又取得了一个辉煌的胜利：九月五日，西藏自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区，以及拉萨市和乌鲁木齐市成立了革命委员会。至此，全中国都成立了无产阶级专政的革命权力机构——革命委员会。现在，从中国最北部的黑龙江省，到南部的海南岛（除台湾省外），都高高飘扬着伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利红旗。
    这是毛泽东的正确的马克思列宁主义路线的光辉胜利，这是毛泽东同志和中国共产党的革命策略和战略的辉煌胜利，它粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫以及中国人民的敌人竭力在中国复辟资本主义的反革命路线。这是社会主义和无产阶级专政在中国的胜利，这一胜利以及对修正主义阴谋家、叛徒和国内反革命分子的毁灭性的打击，粉碎了美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和其他反动派的侵略的反华计划。这一胜利使中国亿万人民感到欢欣并鼓舞他们继续前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命在中国的全面胜利。
    在中华人民共和国发动无产阶级文化大革命以来，已经两年多了。在由毛泽东同志亲自发动、决定和指导并在无产阶级的先锋队——中国共产党领导下的中国无产阶级文化大革命的整个进程中，亿万革命群众、工农兵、学生和人民知识分子，毫无保留地拥护毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想。
    革命群众组织代表、人民解放军部队代表、党政机关的革命领导干部的三结合——这是革命委员会建立的基础，空前巩固。中国无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，标志着整个运动在全国范围内已经进入斗批改的阶段。在这个时期，给予腐朽的旧世界以致命的打击。资产阶级的残余和影响以及修正主义思想正在被铲除。忠于毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线的亿万革命群众，正在捣毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、蒋介石和帝国主义的代理人以及形形色色的反动分子在中国各地的最后巢穴。全中国各地成立革命委员会，是对帝国主义、修正主义和国际反动派的强有力的致命打击，彻底粉碎了他们的一切罪恶企图，使以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏联为首的修正主义者在中国复辟资本主义的一切梦想、计划和阴谋都遭到破灭。恩维尔·霍查同志说：“世界上没有任何力量能阻挡七亿中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。人民中国将永远是社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒，将永远是革命的强大基地，中国共产党将永远是马克思列宁主义的旗手。”
    毛泽东同志最近几星期中发出的关于工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中的作用的最新指示，强调了工人阶级在社会主义建设中的决定性作用，这些指示在中国各地激发了巨大的乐观主义和革命热情，进一步推动了生产战线上的无产阶级革命，确定了工人阶级在教育和文化方面的领导作用，进一步巩固了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级专政在人民中国的阵地。毛泽东同志在总结伟大中国人民的革命斗争的经验时指出：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”他在最新指示中说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛泽东同志指出了工人阶级在文化大革命中，以及在教育和其他一切工作方面的无产阶级革命中的领导作用，从而有力地推动了中国的无产阶级文化革命，加速了对一小撮曾经担任党内和国家领导职务并企图在中国复辟资本主义的一批修正主义叛徒的斗争的最后胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势中，天才的中国人民的创造力量，以史无前例的蓬勃气势迸发出来了。在三大革命运动——阶级斗争，生产斗争和科学实验——中具有丰富实践经验的工人阶级，拥护和无保留地支持毛泽东同志的革命路线，落实党关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示以及自力更生和突出无产阶级政策的伟大原则，在国民经济各部门以及在科学和技术、在教育和文化方面，取得了新的辉煌胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的人民中国抗击国内外的一切敌人，在革命和生产上取得了全面胜利。人民中国已经成为十分强大的社会主义国家，她具有现代工业、先进农业、无产阶级教育和文化，具有达到世界水平顶峰的科学技术和拥有防御所必需的一切武器的强大的防御力量，包括原子武器、导弹和氢弹，给胆敢触犯人民中国的一切侵略者及侵略者的联盟以沉重的打击。
    无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利和毛泽东同志的正确的马克思列宁主义路线，提高了中华人民共和国的国际威望。今天，伟大的人民中国已经是一个真正的社会主义巨人，是一个坚不可摧的社会主义和革命的堡垒，屹立在帝国主义和修正主义敌人面前。对于世界上正在为争取民族和社会解放而斗争的一切革命者、马克思列宁主义者和人民来说，中国已成为他们的可靠的支柱、无限的希望和巨大的鼓舞，而对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，中国则使他们恐惧万分。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚共产党人，为兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的这些新的、伟大的和辉煌的胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞，表示衷心的祝贺，并认为这些胜利是无产阶级革命路线和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。同时，这些胜利也是我们的胜利，也是马克思列宁主义的胜利，也是世界各国革命人民的胜利。这些胜利鼓舞了世界上一切进步人民和一切革命力量为抗击各国人民自由、革命和社会主义的敌人，为抗击以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义而进行的斗争。
