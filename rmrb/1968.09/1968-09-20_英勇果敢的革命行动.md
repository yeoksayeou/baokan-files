	The recent decision by the People's Republic of Albania to solemnly withdraw from the Warsaw Pact is a bold and courageous revolutionary action. Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the great Albanian Labor Party and the great Albanian people have struck a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist clique, greatly encouraging the struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists, and making a significant contribution to the international communist movement. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration and resolute support for this revolutionary action taken by the Albanian people.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The Albanian Labor Party and people have consistently held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposed the policy of aggression and war of U.S. imperialism, and engaged in a head-on struggle with modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership." The Albanian people, who have always been at the forefront of the anti-revisionist struggle, have now decisively announced their withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, demonstrating a high degree of Marxist-Leninist principle. They are indeed a strong shock troop in the international communist movement.

	The Warsaw Pact has long been an instrument of aggression for the Soviet revisionist clique to promote social imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique uses this pact to control the defense forces of other signatory countries, arbitrarily stationing armed forces and conducting military exercises in these countries, and exercising control, enslavement, and plunder over them. The Warsaw Pact manipulated by the Soviet revisionist clique is no different from the North Atlantic Treaty manipulated by U.S. imperialism.

	The Soviet revisionist clique also uses the Warsaw Pact as a means to collude with U.S. imperialism in a counter-revolutionary global conspiracy. In recent years, the Soviet revisionist clique has been eager to link the Warsaw Pact organization with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pushing for so-called "European détente," helping the U.S. maintain its hegemony in Western Europe, and moving troops eastward to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa. The purpose of these treacherous activities by the Soviet revisionist clique is to conspire with U.S. imperialism to attempt to redivide the world.

	The recent events in Czechoslovakia have starkly exposed the aggressive nature of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet revisionist clique, under the banner of the Warsaw Pact, has blatantly invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia by force, while the Czechoslovak revisionist leadership has adopted a policy of capitulation and treason, openly signing a "capitulation agreement." This bloody fact shows that as member states of the Warsaw Pact, their national sovereignty and territorial integrity are not guaranteed in the slightest. If the Soviet revisionists can today rally some member states to invade one member state, why wouldn't they be able to rally some member states to invade another member state tomorrow? Therefore, joining the Warsaw Pact actually puts oneself in the miserable position of being at the mercy of the Soviet revisionists.

	For a long time, the Albanian people have waged an uncompromising struggle against the evil activities of the Soviet revisionist clique using the Warsaw Pact, repeatedly foiling the Soviet revisionist clique's despicable plots to control, interfere with, and overthrow Albania. This time, Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact has dealt an even heavier blow to the Soviet revisionist clique.

	The Albanian people are a heroic people who stand tall and proud. They are closely united around the Albanian Labor Party, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, defending their socialist homeland. This strong red fortress standing on the European continent is impregnable to any counter-revolutionary forces. The great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, has declared in ironclad language: "Whether in the past or today, Albanians are not to be intimidated. The Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party are defending Albania's borders and territory. Whoever dares to touch Albania will have no return."

	The Albanian people are not alone. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand firmly with the Albanian people. All true Marxist-Leninists around the world stand firmly with the Albanian people. The revolutionary peoples of all countries stand firmly with the Albanian people.

	In summary, no matter what happens in the world, we will always stand together with the Albanian people, fight together, and win together. If U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

	Today, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has arrived. The just struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact will continue to rise. The just struggle of the peoples of Western Europe against the U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization will continue to rise. The just struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism will continue to rise. The peoples of the world are uniting more closely to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against these two arch-enemies. The end of these two arch-enemies is not far away!

    英勇果敢的革命行动
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严地宣布退出华沙条约。伟大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和伟大的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下采取的这一英勇果敢的革命行动，给了苏修叛徒集团当头一棒，大大地鼓舞了东欧各国人民反对以苏修为首的现代修正主义的斗争，对国际共产主义运动作出了重大贡献。中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民所采取的这一革命行动，表示由衷的敬佩和坚决的支持。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席曾经指出：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行了针锋相对的斗争。”始终站在反修斗争前列的阿尔巴尼亚人民，这次毅然宣布退出华沙条约，表现了高度的马克思列宁主义的原则性。他们不愧是国际共产主义运动中的一支坚强的突击队。
    华沙条约早已成为苏修叛徒集团推行社会帝国主义的侵略工具。苏修叛徒集团利用这个条约，把其他缔约国的国防力量掌握在自己手里，在这些国家中任意驻扎武装部队，进行军事演习，对它们实行控制、奴役和掠夺。苏修叛徒集团操纵的华沙条约，同美帝国主义操纵的北大西洋公约不过是一路货。
    苏修叛徒集团还把华沙条约作为他们同美帝国主义进行反革命全球勾结的一种手段。近年来，苏修叛徒集团竭力要把华沙条约组织同北大西洋集团挂钩，大搞所谓“欧洲缓和”，帮助美帝维护它在西欧的霸权，并把兵力东移，镇压越南人民和亚非各国人民的革命斗争。苏修叛徒集团这些叛卖活动的目的，就是要同美帝国主义合谋妄图重新瓜分世界。
    这次捷克斯洛伐克事件，赤裸裸地暴露了华沙条约的侵略实质。苏修叛徒集团打着华沙条约的旗号，对捷克斯洛伐克公然进行武装侵略和军事占领，而捷修领导集团采取卖国投降的政策，公然签订了“城下之盟”。这个血淋淋的事实表明，作为华沙条约的成员国，它们的国家主权和领土完整是丝毫没有保障的。苏修今天既然可以纠集一些成员国侵略这一个成员国，明天岂不是同样可以纠集一些成员国侵略那一个成员国吗？因此，参加华沙条约，实际上就是使自己置于任由苏修摆布和宰割的可悲的地位。
    长期以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民对苏修叛徒集团利用华沙条约所干的罪恶活动进行毫不妥协的斗争，一次又一次地粉碎了苏修叛徒集团妄图控制、干涉和颠覆阿尔巴尼亚的卑鄙阴谋。这次，阿尔巴尼亚宣布退出华沙条约，给了苏修叛徒集团更加沉重的打击。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，是顶天立地的英雄人民。他们紧紧地团结在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的周围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，保卫着社会主义的祖国。这个屹立在欧洲大陆的坚强的红色堡垒，是任何反革命力量都攻不破的。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志曾经用钢铁般的语言宣布：“不论是过去还是今天，阿尔巴尼亚人是吓不倒的。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，保卫着阿尔巴尼亚的边境和阿尔巴尼亚的领土，谁胆敢碰一下阿尔巴尼亚，就有来无回。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民决不是孤立的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民坚定地同阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起。全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者坚定地同阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起。各国革命人民坚定地同阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起。
    总之，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    今天，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经到来。东欧各国人民反对苏修控制的华沙条约的正义斗争必将日益高涨。西欧各国人民反对美帝控制的北大西洋公约的正义斗争必将日益高涨。世界各国人民反对美帝、苏修的正义斗争必将日益高涨。全世界人民正在更加紧密地团结起来，对美帝、苏修发动持久的猛烈的进攻。世界人民的这两个头号敌人的末日已经不远了！
