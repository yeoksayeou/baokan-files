Japanese workers and students hold anti-U.S. rallies and marches

Over five hundred workers and students gathered in the evening of September 21st at Yonchō Park in the Kanda district of Tokyo to hold an anti-U.S. rally. Many representatives spoke at the rally, strongly condemning the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. After the rally, participants, holding high many red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," marched along the streets in protest.

The demonstrators continuously chanted slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,'" "Down with the Sato government," and "Down with the revisionist Japanese Communist Party." Over two thousand citizens joined the march. The reactionary Sato government dispatched hundreds of fully armed police who brutally attacked the workers and students, injuring dozens of demonstrators and arbitrarily arresting several. The demonstrators fiercely fought back against the police.

On the same afternoon, two thousand five hundred workers and students in Osaka Prefecture held a rally in Toyonaka City, Osaka, to oppose the use of Osaka International Airport by the U.S. military. After the rally, the participants marched resolutely towards Osaka International Airport to protest.

Two thousand five hundred young workers and patriotic students in Tokyo's neighboring city of Tachikawa held a rally on September 22nd to oppose U.S. military bases. Some students bravely rushed into the U.S. military base, waving red flags and protesting against the U.S.

The rally participants marched resolutely towards the Tachikawa U.S. military base after the rally. The reactionary Sato government dispatched three thousand five hundred armed police, riding in armored cars and equipped with water cannons, to suppress the demonstrators near the military base. Despite the brutal suppression, the demonstrators persisted in holding a fierce protest march in front of the base gate. The just struggle of the demonstrators was praised and supported by thousands of citizens.

Uruguayan workers and students continue their struggle against repression

The struggle of Uruguayan workers and students against the reactionary economic policies of the government authorities and against repression is intensifying. Following the nationwide general strike on September 19th, workers and students in the capital, Montevideo, held new demonstrations on the evening of September 20th, bravely fighting against the reactionary military and police who were suppressing the masses. This was the third consecutive night of mass resistance.

More than a week earlier, one thousand five hundred workers and students who had occupied the state-owned slaughterhouse and cold storage facility to protest unjust closures and layoffs fought against the military and police who were suppressing them on September 20th. In the entire Cerro district where the cold storage facility is located, fierce clashes occurred.

At the same time, near the Republic University in the city center, large numbers of students fought fiercely against the reactionary military and police sent by the government authorities. Demonstrating students built barricades and fiercely retaliated against the military and police with stones. The main street in the city center, "18 de Julio" Avenue, became a massive battlefield.

Mexican students persist in their struggle against repression

Students in Mexico City continued to hold fierce demonstrations on the evening of September 23rd to protest against the brutal repression of the student movement by the reactionary military and police. This was the fifth consecutive day of demonstrations since large numbers of troops entered the National Autonomous University of Mexico on September 18th. On the evening of September 23rd, about three thousand students held a demonstration in front of the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas in the northwest of Mexico City. They were savagely attacked by reactionary police. The students used burning cars as barricades and fought bravely against the police with sticks, stones, and Molotov cocktails for over six hours.

That night, reactionary police surrounded the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas, where the student struggle was intense, and ruthlessly opened fire into the campus. Students used burning cars as barricades to resist the savage attacks of the reactionary police. To stop the police from advancing, they poured gasoline on the roads and set them on fire. They also threw Molotov cocktails at the police cars that came to suppress them, making the police retreat in disarray.
