The Central Committee of the Albanian Women's Union recently held a plenary meeting, reviewed the work in light of the current situation, discussed how to further improve political and ideological education for women in accordance with the Party's resolutions and Comrade Enver Hoxha's instructions, and formulated future tasks.

The meeting pointed out that under the guidance of the Party's correct line, Albanian women have tempered themselves with proletarian ideology, actively participated in various revolutionary movements, further enhanced their political awareness, and are successfully implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress. Currently, women make up 35% of the total workforce and 42% of the rural labor force.

The meeting unanimously endorsed the People's Assembly's resolution to condemn and withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, and on behalf of all Albanian women, reiterated the pledge: as soon as the Party gives the order, as soon as Comrade Enver Hoxha issues the call, all women will immediately take action, take up arms, and defend the motherland, socialism, and the revolution.

The meeting emphasized the need to further strengthen political and ideological work and strengthen the Party's leadership over women's organizations.

Comrade Nexhmije Hoxha, a member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, spoke on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the meeting.

She stressed the main features of the current situation and the tasks of women as active fighters in building socialism and defending the motherland.

	Albanian female youth are pioneers on the agricultural production front. Kreshave Koko was a graduate of the Delvina Agricultural School in 1966. She resolutely responded to the Party's call and returned to her village to participate in production.
