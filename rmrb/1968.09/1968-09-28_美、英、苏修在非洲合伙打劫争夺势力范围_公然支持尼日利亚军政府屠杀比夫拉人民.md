The imperialists of the United States and Britain and the Soviet revisionist leadership have, over the past year, consistently supported the Nigerian Federal Military Government in its large-scale massacre of the Biafran people who declared their secession from the Nigerian Federation. They have committed heinous crimes in Africa.

Biafra was originally the Eastern Region of the Nigerian Federation (the Federation was divided into four regions). It had a population of 13 million, three-quarters of whom were Igbo. After Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the Federal Government was controlled by the pro-British feudal forces of the Hausa and Fulani tribes in the Northern Region. In recent years, the Federal Government has incited and exploited tribal and religious conflicts (the Igbo are Christians, while the Hausa are Muslims), leading to large-scale tribal clashes. As a result, 30,000 Igbo were killed, and 2 million Igbo living in other regions were forced to return to the Eastern Region. The people of the Eastern Region were compelled to declare their secession from the Nigerian Federation on May 30, 1967.

In July of the same year, with the support of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Nigerian Federal Military Government launched a military attack on Biafra. After more than a year of war, the Federal Army, relying on its superior forces and weapons supplied by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, has occupied Biafra's capital, all its ports, and two-thirds of its territory. The Biafran people have suffered large-scale massacres. However, the Biafran people have not surrendered and continue to fight tenaciously.

After Biafra declared its secession from the Nigerian Federation, British imperialism, in order to safeguard its colonial interests, particularly its oil supply (Biafran oil supplies one-tenth of Britain's oil needs), fully supported the Nigerian Federal Military Government in its use of force to destroy Biafra. Britain has continuously provided large amounts of military aid to the Nigerian Federal Military Government and sent British officers to participate directly in the war.

The United States has always considered Nigeria, the most populous and resource-rich country in Africa, as one of its key targets for penetration. U.S. private investments in Nigeria have grown rapidly in recent years, reaching nearly $100 million, second only to Britain's over $200 million, and most of these investments are in the Eastern Region. After the war broke out between the Nigerian Federal Military Government and Biafra, the United States actively supported Britain's armed intervention while adopting a two-faced policy to maintain its political and economic interests in Nigeria and reap the benefits. On one hand, the United States attempted to woo Biafra; on the other hand, it repeatedly declared to the Federal Military Government that it only recognizes the Federal Military Government as the sole legal government of Nigeria. Since June of this year, as the United States saw the war situation favoring the Federal Military Government, it further supported it, pressuring Biafra to surrender to the Federal Military Government. The Associated Press revealed on July 25 that the United States had repeatedly contacted Biafran representatives in various places, "advising" Biafra to be "realistic," "abandon secession," and "form a united Nigeria." The mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, The New York Times, openly demanded on August 27 that Biafra "seriously discuss" the Federal Military Government's so-called "reconciliation conditions," which are essentially demands for Biafra's surrender.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, which promotes neo-colonialism in Africa, in order to infiltrate Nigeria and share the spoils with U.S. and British imperialism, openly supported the Federal Military Government in its war to massacre the Biafran people. Shortly after the war broke out last year, as the Federal Military Government suffered defeats on the battlefield, the Soviet revisionists immediately provided 15 MiG jet fighters and a large number of military technical personnel through a so-called "cultural agreement" to help the Federal Army fight against Biafra and repeatedly replenished the lost Soviet-made MiG aircraft in battle. Since March of this year, the Soviet revisionists have sold or provided through other means seven Ilyushin-28 jet bombers and a large number of 500-pound bombs to the Federal Military Government. The foreign mercenaries piloting these Soviet-made aircraft are all trained by the Soviet revisionists. According to a Federal Army lieutenant captured by Biafra in August, Soviet officers participated in commanding the Federal Army's operations. The Nigerian Ambassador to the Soviet Union praised the Soviet revisionists as the "strongest ally" of the Federal Military Government in May, acknowledging that without the Soviet revisionists' "aid," "we would be in a much more difficult situation today."

The collaboration between U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionists in redividing spheres of influence in Africa has caused the tragedy in Nigeria and Biafra, further educating the Biafran people and the broader African people. As long as the Biafran people persist in their struggle and anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist stance, they will surely achieve victory.

    美、英、苏修在非洲合伙打劫争夺势力范围
    公然支持尼日利亚军政府屠杀比夫拉人民
    据新华社讯　美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，一年多来一直支持尼日利亚联邦军政府，对宣布脱离了尼日利亚联邦的比夫拉人民进行大规模屠杀，在非洲犯下了滔天的罪行。
    比夫拉原来是组成尼日利亚联邦的东区（联邦共分四区），人口一千三百万，三分之二是伊博族。尼日利亚在一九六○年独立以后，联邦政府大权一直操在北区豪萨族和富拉尼族的亲英封建势力手里。近年来，联邦政府加紧煽动和利用部族和宗教（伊博族信仰基督教，豪萨族信仰伊斯兰教）矛盾，挑起大规模的部族冲突，结果有三万伊博族人被杀害，两百万散居在其它各区的伊博族人被迫逃回东区。东区人民被迫在一九六七年五月三十日宣布脱离尼日利亚联邦。
    同年七月，尼日利亚联邦军政府在美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团支持下，对比夫拉发动军事进攻。经过一年多的战争，联邦军队依仗优势兵力和美英苏的武器装备，已经占领了比夫拉的首府、全部港口和三分之二的地区，比夫拉人民遭到大规模的屠杀。但是，比夫拉人民并没有屈服，仍在顽强地坚持斗争。
    在比夫拉宣布脱离尼日利亚联邦后，英帝国主义为了确保其殖民利益，特别是石油供应（比夫拉石油供应英国用油十分之一），全力支持尼日利亚联邦军政府用武力摧毁比夫拉。英帝不断地向尼日利亚联邦军政府提供大量军援，并派英籍军官直接参战。
    美帝国主义一直把人口最多、资源丰富的非洲大国尼日利亚视为它对非洲渗透的重点国家之一。美国在尼日利亚的私人投资近几年来增长特别快，已经达到将近一亿美元，仅次于英国的二亿多英镑，而且大部分投资在东区。在尼日利亚联邦军政府和比夫拉之间的战争爆发后，美帝积极支持英帝的武装干涉，同时采取两面政策，以便使自己处于主动地位，保持其在尼日利亚的政治和经济利益，坐收渔翁之利。美帝一方面对比夫拉企图进行拉拢；另一方面又对联邦军政府再三声明，只承认联邦军政府为尼日利亚唯一合法政府。今年六月以后，美帝眼看战局对联邦军政府有利，就进一步支持它，逼比夫拉向联邦军政府投降。美国通讯社七月二十五日就透露，美国一再与各地的比夫拉代表接触，“劝告”比夫拉要“现实”，“放弃分裂”，“组成一个统一的尼日利亚”。美国垄断资本喉舌《纽约时报》在八月二十七日公开叫嚷，要比夫拉“认真讨论”联邦军政府提出的实际上是要比夫拉投降的所谓“和解条件”。
    在非洲推行新殖民主义政策的苏修领导集团，为了挤进尼日利亚，同美英帝国主义分赃，竟公开支持联邦军政府进行屠杀比夫拉人民的战争。去年战争爆发后不久，联邦军政府在战场上节节败退，苏修即在八月通过所谓“文化协定”向联邦军政府紧急提供了十五架米格喷气战斗机和大批军事技术人员，帮助联邦军队对比夫拉作战，并一再补充在战斗中损失的苏制米格机。今年三月以来，苏修又卖给或通过其他途径给联邦军政府七架伊柳辛——28型喷气轰炸机和大量五百磅炸弹。驾驶这些苏制飞机的外国雇佣军，都是经苏修训练的飞行员。另据今年八月间被比夫拉俘虏的一名联邦军队中尉供认，有苏修军官参与指挥联邦军队的作战。尼日利亚驻苏联大使今年五月间就大肆赞扬苏修是联邦军政府“最强大的盟友”。他承认说，当初如果没有苏修的“援助”，“我们今天将会处于困难得多的地步”。
    美英帝国主义同苏修相互勾结，重新在非洲划分势力范围，而在尼日利亚和比夫拉造成的悲剧，进一步教育了比夫拉人民和广大的非洲人民。比夫拉人民只要坚持斗争，坚持反帝反修，他们就一定会赢得胜利。
