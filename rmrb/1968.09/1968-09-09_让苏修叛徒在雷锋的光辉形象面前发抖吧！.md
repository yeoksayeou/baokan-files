Recently, the Soviet revisionist magazine "Foreign Literature" published a malicious article attacking Comrade Lei Feng, a good soldier of Chairman Mao and our old platoon leader. It attacked Lei Feng for "completely obeying Mao Zedong," and viciously cursed him, claiming that Lei Feng "erased humanity" and was a "person who brings death to others." It also cried out in fear that the Cultural Revolution in China shows how "dangerous" figures like Lei Feng are! The curses and attacks of the Soviet revisionist traitors have aroused our utmost indignation. They attempt to defame the radiant image of Lei Feng, and we will not allow it!

"Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The Soviet revisionist traitors' gnashing of teeth and curses do not diminish Lei Feng's brilliant radiance; instead, they further prove the nobility and greatness of Lei Feng's heroic deeds.

The Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly attacks our old platoon leader Lei Feng, which is an attack on the great thought of Mao Zedong. Because Lei Feng is a great communist warrior nurtured by the thought of Mao Zedong, and everything Lei Feng did shines with the light of Mao Zedong's thought. It is precisely in the face of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong that Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang of traitors have issued their desperate, dying howls!

"Completely obey Mao Zedong." Yes. Lei Feng was a good soldier who completely obeyed Chairman Mao and firmly carried out Chairman Mao's instructions. He was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whatever Chairman Mao said, he did. In his heart, there was only Chairman Mao and only Mao Zedong thought. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the great teacher of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong thought most concentratedly embodies the revolutionary wisdom of the proletariat and the working people, represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people, is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and revisionism, and is a treasure for defeating enemies and transforming the world. Following Chairman Mao closely is happiness, and following Chairman Mao closely is victory. It is the great thought of Mao Zedong that armed Lei Feng, making him an immortal communist warrior.

The Soviet revisionist clique harbors deep hatred for Mao Zedong thought, which is determined by their class nature. They have already cut down the red flag of Marxism-Leninism that flew over the Kremlin to restore capitalism. They have distorted, mutilated, and desecrated Marxism-Leninism in every way. They have betrayed the great revolutionary cause led by Lenin and Stalin, betrayed the path of the October Socialist Revolution, and turned the first socialist state built by Lenin into a living specimen of capitalist restoration. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk are shameless traitors to Leninism. It is no surprise that they oppose the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, and oppose Mao Zedong thought.

The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is a fierce struggle between "public" and "private." The core of the proletarian worldview is the character "public," while the core of the bourgeois and all exploiting classes' worldview is the character "private." The struggle between "public" and "private" is like fire and water, irreconcilable.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us to be "selfless and dedicated to the public," to "wholeheartedly serve the people." This is the most scientific summary of the communist spirit. Comrade Lei Feng fully practiced Chairman Mao's teaching. As he said before his death, he would "dedicate his limited life to the limitless service of the people," and "dedicate all his strength and his entire life to the cause of liberating humanity and building communism." Lei Feng's life was one of complete selflessness and wholehearted service to the people. With such a spirit, one becomes the bravest, able to be warm to comrades like spring and ruthless to enemies like severe winter, able to dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and able to sacrifice his life for the glorious cause of communism. The Soviet revisionist clique's crazy slander and attack are precisely against Lei Feng's great communist spirit.

In the face of Comrade Lei Feng's towering image, the Soviet revisionist traitors appear so small! These traitors are extremely despicable bourgeois egoists, and their slogan is: "If one does not seek personal gain, one will be punished by heaven and earth." From head to toe, they exude the stench of the bourgeois "private" character. The "humanity" they talk about is the ugly nature of bourgeois selfishness and greed.

To restore capitalism in the Soviet Union and maintain bourgeois dictatorship, the Soviet revisionist clique has cut down the communist spirit taught by Lenin and used bourgeois egoism to corrupt the Soviet people, especially the younger generation. They have allowed the decayed American way of life to spread in the Soviet Union, tempting Soviet youth to pursue money, cars, comfortable small families, and eating, drinking, and entertainment. These shameless traitors try to erase the images of Soviet heroes like Pavel Korchagin, Zoya, and Matrosov, who emerged under the education of Lenin and Stalin, and even publicly declare that "heroes like Pavel Korchagin are outdated." Today, the so-called literary works of the Soviet revisionists elevate traitors, petty bourgeois, hooligans, and thugs as "heroes" and sing their praises. This fully exposes the filthy, reactionary souls of the Soviet revisionist clique.

Starting from bourgeois egoism, the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly attacks the view of life and death of Lei Feng-style communist warriors. The Soviet revisionist traitors loudly advocate the philosophy of "living for living" and "if the head is lost, what use is principle?" For them, to preserve their dog's life, they can sell out anything. Haven't they already knelt down before the Americans, shamelessly betraying the interests of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world, and betraying the cause of the proletariat and communism? These traitors with broken spines are extremely vicious and ruthless to the revolutionary people of the world. Look! The Soviet revisionists recently invaded Czechoslovakia with weapons, isn't that a brutal suppression of the Czechoslovakian people?

The Soviet revisionist clique says that the Cultural Revolution in China shows how "dangerous" Lei Feng-style figures are! Respectable gentlemen, you said it well. Lei Feng-style figures nurtured by Mao Zedong thought are indeed "dangerous" to the Soviet revisionist clique! The proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is creating tens of millions of Lei Fengs, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of the entire people. This great influence will inevitably transcend China's borders and spread throughout the world. Tens of millions of Lei Feng-style communist warriors will bring happiness to the Chinese people and the people of the world, but indeed "bring death" to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries! The communist spirit of Lei Feng makes all the ghosts and demons in the world feel terrified, feeling the end is near.

We proletarians and revolutionary people must enthusiastically praise Zhang Side, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Meng He, and other communist warriors nurtured by Mao Zedong thought. We must inherit and carry forward their glorious traditions and take them as examples, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought and marching forward bravely! Let the Soviet revisionist clique tremble before the great thought of Mao Zedong and before the towering image of our old platoon leader, the great communist warrior Lei Feng!

### 让苏修叛徒在雷锋的光辉形象面前发抖吧！

    让苏修叛徒在雷锋的光辉形象面前发抖吧！
    雷锋生前所在班全体战士
    不久前，苏修《外国文学》杂志抛出了一篇黑文章，对毛主席的好战士、我们的老班长雷锋同志进行恶毒攻击。它攻击雷锋同志“完全听从毛泽东”，疯狂咒骂雷锋抹煞“人性”，是什么“给人带来死亡的人”，并且惊恐地叫嚷，中国的文化大革命表明，象雷锋式的人物是“多么危险”！苏修叛徒的咒骂和攻击，激起了我们无比的愤慨。他们妄图诋毁雷锋的光辉形象，我们决不答应！
    “被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”苏修叛徒咬牙切齿地咒骂，丝毫无损于雷锋的灿烂光辉，更加证明了雷锋英雄事迹的高尚和伟大。
    苏修叛徒集团无耻地攻击我们的老班长雷锋，也就是攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。因为雷锋是用毛泽东思想哺育成长的伟大的共产主义战士，雷锋的一切言行都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光芒。正是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想面前，勃列日涅夫、柯西金这伙叛徒发出了绝望垂死的嚎叫！
    “完全听从毛泽东”。对了。雷锋就是一个完全听毛主席的话，坚决照毛主席指示办事的好战士。他无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席怎么说，他就怎么做，他心中只有毛主席，只有毛泽东思想。我们的伟大领袖毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大的导师，是我们心中最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想最集中地体现了无产阶级和劳动人民的革命智慧，代表了无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益，是反对帝国主义和修正主义的强大的思想武器，是克敌制胜，改天换地的法宝。紧跟毛主席就是幸福，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。正是伟大的毛泽东思想武装了雷锋，使他成为一个不朽的共产主义战士。
    苏修叛徒集团对毛泽东思想怀有刻骨仇恨，这是他们的阶级本性所决定的。他们为了复辟资本主义，早已砍掉了飘扬在克里姆林宫上空的马克思列宁主义的红旗。他们百般歪曲、阉割、糟踏马克思列宁主义。他们背叛了列宁斯大林领导苏联人民所创建的伟大的革命事业，背叛了十月社会主义革命的道路，把列宁所缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家变成了资本主义复辟的活标本。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流是列宁主义的无耻叛徒，他们反对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，是丝毫也不奇怪的。
    无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，就是一场“公”与“私”的激烈斗争。无产阶级世界观的核心是个“公”字，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的世界观的核心是个“私”字。“公”和“私”的斗争是水火不相容的，不可调和的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：要“毫不利己专门利人”，“全心全意地为人民服务”。这是共产主义精神的最科学的概括。雷锋同志完全实践了毛主席的这个教导。正象他生前所说的，他把自己“有限的生命，投入无限的‘为人民服务’中去”，“把自己的全部力量和整个生命献给人类解放的事业，建设共产主义的事业”。雷锋同志的一生，就是大公无私，全心全意为人民服务的一生。一个人有了这样的精神，他就变得最勇敢，就能够“对同志象春天一样的温暖，对敌人象严冬一样的残酷无情”，就能刀山敢上，火海敢闯，就能够不惜以自己的生命去殉共产主义的壮丽事业。苏修叛徒集团疯狂地诬蔑和攻击的，正是雷锋同志的这种伟大的共产主义精神。
    在雷锋同志高大的形象面前，苏修叛徒显得多么的渺小！这伙叛徒都是极端卑鄙的资产阶级利己主义者，他们的旗号是：“人不为己，天诛地灭”，他们从头到脚都散发着资产阶级“私”字的臭气。他们所说的“人性”，就是资产阶级的自私自利、唯利是图的丑恶本性。
    为了在苏联国内复辟资本主义，维持资产阶级专政，苏修叛徒集团大砍列宁所教导的共产主义精神，而用资产阶级利己主义来腐蚀苏联人民，特别是苏联的年青一代。他们让腐朽的美国生活方式在苏联泛滥，引诱苏联青年去追求金钱、小轿车、舒适的小家庭以及吃喝玩乐。这伙无耻的叛徒力图在苏联人民心中抹煞保尔·柯察金、卓娅、马特洛索夫等在列宁斯大林教育下涌现的苏联英雄的形象，甚至公开宣布，“象保尔·柯察金这样的英雄早已过时了。”今天，苏修的所谓文学作品，把一些叛徒、市侩、流氓、阿飞，统统抬了出来，当作“英雄”，大加歌颂。这完全暴露了苏修叛徒集团的肮脏透顶、反动透顶的丑恶灵魂。
    从资产阶级利己主义出发，苏修叛徒集团无耻地攻击雷锋式共产主义战士的生死观。苏修叛徒们大肆宣扬“一切为了活着”、“脑袋丢了，原则还有什么用”的叛徒活命哲学。对他们说来，为了保持自己的狗命，他们是什么都可以出卖的。他们不是已经跪倒在美帝的脚下，无耻地出卖苏联人民和世界革命人民的利益，出卖无产阶级和共产主义的事业吗？这伙断了脊梁骨的癞皮狗，对于世界革命人民却无比的凶恶和残忍。你看！苏修最近武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克，不就是残暴地镇压捷克斯洛伐克的人民吗？
    苏修叛徒集团说，中国的文化大革命表明，雷锋式的人物是“多么危险”！可敬的先生们，你们说得好极了。用毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的雷锋式的人物，对于苏修叛徒集团来说，确实很“危险”！中国的无产阶级文化大革命，正在造就千千万万个雷锋，大大促进全国人民的思想革命化。这种巨大的影响，必然超出中国的国界，传播到全世界。千万个雷锋式的共产主义战士，给中国人民和世界人民带来幸福，而确实给帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派“带来死亡”！雷锋的共产主义精神，使世界上的一切牛鬼蛇神感到恐慌，感到末日的来临。
    我们无产阶级和革命人民，就是要热情地歌颂张思德、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、门合等等在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的共产主义战士。我们要继承和发扬他们的光荣传统，并以他们为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！让苏修叛徒集团在伟大的毛泽东思想面前，在我们的老班长、伟大的共产主义战士雷锋的高大形象面前发抖吧！
