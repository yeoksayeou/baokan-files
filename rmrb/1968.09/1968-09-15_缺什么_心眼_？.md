Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended lowly interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people."

What kind of "heart" is lacking?

After Old Worker Zhao Deyi gave a lecture on Mao Zedong Thought, the students were deeply moved and began discussing. They all said that workers studying Chairman Mao's works are better than us. They learn and apply, saying what they mean and doing what they say, while we are "Marxism-Leninism on the bayonet, aimed at others but not at ourselves." In the discussion, a student suddenly said, "This teacher lacks a heart."

Not saying anything was fine, but once said, it sparked a debate among the students. "Saying the teacher lacks a heart, isn't this the same as when some people in the past slandered Lei Feng as a fool?" So, they started commenting one after another.

The students listed many facts about Teacher Zhao's selfless dedication to others, illustrating the excellent qualities of the working class. Over the past few years, Teacher Zhao has stayed in the factory every Saturday evening to guard it voluntarily. During the day, he sacrifices his rest time to travel throughout the Shijingshan area, giving haircuts to workers and their families. Can this be called lacking a heart? Teacher Zhao used the two yuan and fifty jiao his wife gave him to buy a knife, spending only forty jiao on a discounted knife, and used the remaining two yuan to buy a shaving knife to give free haircuts to everyone. This spirit of selflessness, is this lacking a heart? After Chairman Mao issued the great call to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Teacher Zhao immediately responded, organizing family study groups, and later resident study groups. He also had his own children clean the streets and public toilets. Can this be called lacking a heart?

At this point, a student surnamed Liang, sitting in the corner of the table, stood up to speak. He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are stamped with the mark of the class.' Based on this great teaching, we should also conduct a class analysis of 'heart,' to see which class's 'heart' is lacking and which class's 'heart' is abundant. Looking at Teacher Zhao's actual actions, he lacks the bourgeoisie's selfish 'heart' and has more of the proletariat's public-spirited 'heart.' To be a true communist, one must have only one heart, which is an unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We come to the factory to learn this loyalty from the working class. We need the working class's public-spirited 'heart.' I have some opinions about today's meeting. That is, everyone should not direct their criticism at this student. This is not good. We should direct it at China's Khrushchev. For a long time, China's Khrushchev has promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, spreading the philosophy of 'suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage' and the theory of 'merging public and private interests' among the youth, openly opposing the brilliant communist thought of 'selflessness and dedication to the people,' 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people. Therefore, saying which class's 'heart' is lacking is a struggle between two lines. We must criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, eliminate his poison, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves and the world."

After hearing Liang's speech, everyone was very excited. That student also stood up, raised his fist, and shouted: "Learn from the working class! Pay tribute to the working class! Down with China's Khrushchev! Thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois worldview!"

### 缺什么“心眼”？

    毛主席教导我们：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    缺什么“心眼”？
    老工人赵德义师傅讲完毛泽东思想辅导课之后，同学们都深受感动，纷纷议论，都说工人阶级学毛主席著作就是比我们好，人家学了就用，说得到做得到，而我们是“马克思列宁主义上刺刀，对人不对己”。在议论中，一个同学却冒出一句话：“这师傅缺心眼”。
    不说不要紧，这一说却引来了周围同学的议论。“说师傅缺心眼，这不是和过去有人污蔑雷锋是傻子一样的论调吗？”于是，就你一言我一语地评论开了。
    同学们列举了赵师傅毫不利己专门利人的大量事实，说明了工人阶级的优秀品质。几年来，赵师傅每逢星期六晚上，都留在车间义务守卫工厂，平日他又牺牲休息时间，走遍了石景山地区，为职工和家属理发，这能叫缺心眼吗？赵师傅把爱人给他买菜刀的两元五角钱，只花了四角钱买了一把处理菜刀，而用二块钱买了剃头刀，为大家义务理发，这种毫不利己专门利人的精神，难道是缺心眼吗？毛主席发出大办毛泽东思想学习班的伟大号召以后，赵师傅立即响应，组织家庭学习班，后来又办居民学习班，并让自家的孩子打扫街道，打扫公共厕所，这能叫缺心眼吗？
    这时，坐在桌子一角的一个姓梁的同学站起来发言。他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。’根据这一伟大教导，我们对‘心眼’也要来个阶级分析，看一看缺的是那个阶级的
  ‘心眼’，多的是那个阶级的‘心眼’。拿赵师傅的实际行动来看，他缺的是资产阶级私字的‘心眼’，多的是无产阶级公字的‘心眼’。要作一个真正的共产主义者，就只能有一个心眼，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的无限忠心。我们到工厂来，就是要向工人阶级学习这个忠字。要的就是工人阶级公字的心眼。对今天的会，我还有点意见，这就是大家不要把矛头指向这位同学，这不好，应该指向中国赫鲁晓夫。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，在青年中贩卖‘吃小亏，占大便宜’的市侩哲学，‘公私溶化’论等谬论，公然对抗‘毫不利己专门利人’，‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务的光辉的共产主义思想。所以说缺那个阶级的心眼，是为公还是为私，这是两条路线的斗争。我们要把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，肃清他的流毒，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，改造世界。”
    听了梁同学这一番话，大家都很激动，那位同学也霍地站起来，伸出拳头高呼：“向工人阶级学习！向工人阶级致敬！打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！彻底批判反动的资产阶级世界观！”
