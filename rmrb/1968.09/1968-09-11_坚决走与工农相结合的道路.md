Recently, I have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution. Reflecting on the path I have taken since graduating from high school and returning to the countryside to participate in production, every step has proven that Chairman Mao's great thought on intellectuals combining with workers and peasants is extraordinarily wise and correct. This has further strengthened my resolve to spend my life in the countryside.

	Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions
	In 1964, before graduating from high school, a classmate said to me, "Huijuan, let's take the college entrance exam together. With education, you can do anything you want in the future." Others said, "You come from a good family, with good conditions at home, and you'll definitely get into college." To be sure, my conditions were good. My family is poor peasants, all six adults in the family are Party members, and my father, Geng Changsuo, is a nationally renowned labor model. Should I go to college or return to the village to participate in agricultural production? I was indecisive and decided to discuss it with my father to hear his opinion.

	One Sunday, I happily told my father, "I am the first high school graduate in our family, and I am about to graduate..." Before I could finish, my father sternly said, "Graduating is good, but I won't acknowledge your graduation certificate. Your thinking has not graduated yet." My father's criticism shocked me. I thought, I didn't cause trouble in school, was evaluated as an active member in studying Chairman Mao's works, why didn't my father give me advice but instead criticized me? I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure it out.

	As the graduation date approached, my inner struggle intensified. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement." Chairman Mao said, "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually combine with the workers and peasants." Comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with my own thoughts, I became clearer. I decided to take the path of combining with workers and peasants. I discussed it with my father again. My father happily said, "This time I am at ease. As long as you follow Chairman Mao's words, I approve. In the old society, our family suffered generation after generation. In 1943, during a severe drought, there was no harvest, and I was so hungry that I couldn't get off the kang. My mother led the whole family to beg for food, and two dan of sorghum was enough to sell my elder sister. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading the poor to revolt, we wouldn't have today, let alone high school, we might not even have our lives. If we don't follow Chairman Mao's words, we are ungrateful!" My father's words aroused my hatred for the old society, strengthened my love for Chairman Mao, and further strengthened my resolve to take the path of combining with workers and peasants. Back at school, I was the first to write an application to return to the village to participate in labor. However, those who maintained the old educational system used various means to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary educational line, saying that my action of returning to the village to participate in labor was "not what the Party advocates," and repeatedly told me to "carefully consider my personal future." I didn't listen to them and firmly told them, "Chairman Mao's instructions are the Party's needs and what the Party should advocate. The Party's needs are my future." In this way, after struggling, I finally won and, after taking the graduation exam, happily returned to the village to become an ordinary farmer.

	Overcome Obstacles and Face Difficulties
	After returning to the countryside to participate in production, does that mean I have combined with the poor and lower-middle peasants? No. To truly combine with the broad masses in thought and emotion, one must undergo long-term testing and tempering in class struggle and production struggle.

	Just out of school, I was full of enthusiasm and determined to do a good job in my new position. The day after I returned home, I went to the fields with the villagers to harvest wheat. In terms of labor, although I had also worked, I was far from being able to work in a team. The same amount of work, others had already finished, but I hadn't even finished half, and my hands were blistered. When others rested, they chatted and laughed; I was too tired to say anything. Back home, my waist and legs ached, and I lay on the kang unwilling to move. At this time, someone said coldly, "Giving up college for this, you deserve it." Others said, "Your father is a labor model, let him talk to the higher-ups to find a job."

	Facing these rumors, I felt a bit depressed. My father saw through my thoughts and said to me, "Work cannot be feared. Only through hard work can one change one's thoughts and temper one's will. To avoid labor is to not follow Chairman Mao's words, it is not revolutionary!" Listening to my father's words, I reread Chairman Mao's great teachings, "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." I felt Chairman Mao's words were even more affectionate, strengthening my resolve and courage to overcome difficulties, and together with everyone, insisted on completing the wheat harvest.

	Chairman Mao said, "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." After returning from school to the village, through labor tempering, although the distance between my thoughts and class feelings with the masses has narrowed, to a large extent, I am still a petty-bourgeois intellectual. I must constantly reform myself with Mao Zedong Thought to fundamentally transform my world outlook. One day, I returned from the fields and on the way met two young women, Geng Fen and Qiao Xiufang, who were pushing the manure and urine collected from each household to the edge of the village and dumping it into a pit. I put down my shovel, intending to help, but as soon as I got to the edge of the pit, I retreated, feeling that the buckets inside and outside were sticky with manure and urine, and I couldn't bear it. They saw through my thoughts, one hand scooping the bottom, the other hand lifting the bucket, and dumped the manure and urine into the pit. Manure and urine splashed on their faces, but they didn't mind, wiped their hands, and pushed the cart away laughing and chatting. Their actions moved me deeply. I thought, why are we the same people, they can do it, but I can't? After returning home, I opened Chairman Mao's works. He said, "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Studying Chairman Mao's teachings, my face felt hot, realizing that my standpoint was still that of a petty-bourgeois; the manure bucket is not dirty, it is my thoughts that are dirty. To fundamentally transform my world outlook, I must resolutely decide to roll in the mud and sweat with the masses in labor. From then on, I worked even harder to strengthen my ideological reform.

	In the Storms of Class Struggle
	In the journey of combining with workers and peasants, one must undergo the test and tempering of class struggle. When I was in high school, I had a weak sense of class struggle, thinking that with seven hundred million people in our country, a few enemies could not cause much trouble, and we could handle them with our militia. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, facing the class enemies, I realized that "enemies will not be eliminated on their own," and "all reactionary things, if you do not fight them, they will not fall." As the movement deepened, class struggle and the struggle between the two lines became more intense. Some class enemies openly came out, disrupting the militia's study of Chairman Mao's works. Facing these situations, as the deputy commander of the militia battalion, I, on the one hand, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle with everyone, and on the other hand, led the militia in a resolute struggle against the class enemies, finally repelling the enemy's attack. The class enemies were not reconciled to this defeat. They hatched new plots, proposing to "knock down the militia battalion and seize the militia's guns," saying that the "militia battalion is a royalist command, and without overthrowing the militia battalion, the power of the Party branch cannot be seized." They directed their spears at me, saying that I returned to the village after graduating from high school to seek official positions and wealth, to maintain the Geng family's hegemony in Wugong Brigade. They vowed not to rest until they had dealt with Geng Huijuan.

	In the face of the class enemies' attacks, should I retreat in fear and not dare to struggle, or should I display a fearless revolutionary spirit and engage in a head-on struggle with the enemy? At first, selfishness prevailed, thinking that after graduating and returning to the village, I had been working hard for the collective, not seeking fame or profit, and always taking the lead in everything. Now the enemies were manipulating a group of people to fight against me, it was really not worth it, and it was better to stay at home and not move, maybe their attacks on me would ease. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," I realized that my thoughts were completely wrong. So, I actively joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against the class enemies, writing big-character posters to expose their reactionary facts, which immediately suppressed their reactionary momentum. Through this struggle, I once again understood that class struggle is long-term, sharp, and complex, and I must firmly hold the gun in my hand, strike the enemy, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	In the movement, to further raise my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, I actively participated in the revolutionary criticism. In addition to writing dozens of critical articles, I also organized with the militia six critical columns, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary fallacies of "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," "material incentive," and "the theory of the extinction of class struggle" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. I also exposed, denounced, and criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of the revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, who resisted the study of Chairman Mao's works and promoted large-scale competitions.

	Make the Propagation of Mao Zedong Thought a Lifetime Task
	On November 13, 1967, during the Beijing Military Region Conference of Active Members in Studying Mao Zedong Thought, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. This is the most unforgettable day of my life and also the happiest day of my life. For someone like me, a common girl from a poor peasant family, to see the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, how happy it is! I am determined to further study, use, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, so that the whole village and the whole county become a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought.

	I do not miss any opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Once, I and a group of young people returned from the fields and saw some animal dung at the crossroads. I threw the dung I picked up into the fields of the third team, but a young woman threw hers into the fields of her own team. I asked her why, and she said, "The third team produced more grain and didn't let our team eat it, so why throw it in the third team's fields?" This matter seemed small, but it involved the question of whether farming is for the public or for private gain. So, in the field study class, I organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," and then discussed this matter, which gave everyone a profound education. That young woman said excitedly, "Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly, but I only saw our team's sky and did not see the entire collective and the entire revolution. This is against Chairman Mao's teachings." From then on, these young people worked wholeheartedly for the collective and showed the spirit of farming for the revolution in many aspects.

	× × ×

	In the past four years, because I followed Chairman Mao's words and took the path of combining with workers and peasants, I have gained the trust of the masses. Soon after returning to my hometown, I was evaluated as an active member in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and was elected as a member of the county revolutionary committee. However, I deeply feel that I am still far from Chairman Mao's requirements. In the future, I will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and more seriously temper and reform myself in actual struggles, determined to transform myself into a laborer with proletarian consciousness and culture.

    坚决走与工农相结合的道路
    河北省饶阳县五公大队知识青年　耿惠娟
    最近，我反复学习了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，回顾自己高中毕业后回乡参加生产劳动所走过的道路，每一步都证明了毛主席关于知识分子要与工农相结合的伟大思想，无比英明、无比正确，更加坚定了我在农村干一辈子的决心。
      毛主席怎么说我就怎么做
    一九六四年高中毕业前，有个同学对我说：“惠娟，咱们一块考大学吧。有了文化，以后干什么都能吃得开。”也有人对我说：“你出身好，家庭条件不错，升大学一考一个准。”要说条件我是不错，家是贫农，全家六个成年人都是党员，父亲耿长锁又是全国著名的劳动模范。究竟是升学呢，还是回村参加农业生产？我一时拿不定主意，打算跟父亲商量商量，听听他的意见。
    一个星期天，我高兴地对父亲说：“我是咱们家第一个高中生，眼下就要毕业啦……。”没等我说完，父亲就严肃地说：“毕业好啊，不过你拿到毕业证书，我也不承认，你的思想还没有毕业。”父亲的批评，使我大吃一惊。我想，自己在学校里不调皮，不捣乱，又被评为学习毛主席著作积极分子，为什么父亲不但不给拿主意，反倒这样批评自己呢？想了半天，我怎么也猜不透。
    毕业的时间越来越近，我的思想斗争也越来越激烈。这时，我学习了毛主席的光辉著作《青年运动的方向》。毛主席说：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”对照毛主席的教导，检查自己的思想，心里越来越开朗了，我下定决心走与工农相结合的道路。我再次跟父亲商量。父亲高兴地说：“这回我就放心了，只要听毛主席的话，我就赞成。旧社会咱家辈辈受穷，一九四三年大旱没收成，饿得我连炕都起不来，你母亲领着全家外逃要饭，二斗高粱就把你大姐卖了。要不是毛主席领导穷人闹革命，咱们哪有今天，你甭说上高中，怕连命也早没有了。咱们要是不听毛主席的话，就是忘本呀！”
    父亲的一席话，激起了我对旧社会的愤恨，增强了我对毛主席的热爱，更加坚定了我走与工农相结合的道路的决心。回到学校，我第一个写了毕业后回村参加劳动的申请书。可是，那些维护旧教育制度的家伙们，却用尽种种手段，破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命教育路线，说什么我回村参加劳动的作法“不是党所提倡的”，并多次叫我“慎重考虑个人的前途”。我没听他们那一套，坚定地对他们说：“毛主席的指示，就是党的需要，就是党要提倡的。党的需要，就是我的前途。”就这样，经过斗争，我终于取得了胜利，在参加毕业考试以后，愉快地回到了村里，当一名普通的农民。
      踢开拦路虎，迎着困难上
    回到农村参加生产劳动以后，是不是就算和贫下中农群众相结合了呢？不是。要真正和广大群众从思想上、感情上结合起来，还得在阶级斗争、生产斗争中经受长期的考验和锻炼。
    刚出学校门，我热情很高，决心在新的岗位上好好干一番。回家的第二天，我就和社员一块下地收割小麦。论劳动，虽然我也干过，不过要真正跟班劳动可就差远了。一样多的活，别人已经割到头，可我却连一半还没割完，两手还起了泡。别人歇晌时，又说又笑；我呢，累得什么都不愿说。回到家，腰痛腿酸，躺在炕上不愿动。这时，有人冷言冷语地说：“放着大学不考，自作自受。”还有人说：“你爹是劳动模范，叫他和上级说说，找个工作做吧。”
    面对这些风言风语，我心里也有点闷闷不乐。父亲看透了我的心思，就对我说：“干活不能怕累，只有累，才能改造自己的思想，锻炼自己的意志。想逃避劳动，就是不听毛主席的话，不革命呀！”听了父亲的话，我又重温了毛主席“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的伟大教导，更觉得毛主席的话亲切，增强了战胜困难的决心和勇气，和大家一起，坚持把小麦收完。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我从学校回村后经过劳动锻炼，虽然在思想和阶级感情上和群众的距离缩小了，但是在很大程度上，还是一个小资产阶级的知识分子。必须用毛泽东思想不断地改造自己，才能使自己的世界观彻底转变。有一天，我从地里回家，半路上碰见耿芬、乔秀芳两个女青年，她们正把从各户收集的人粪尿推到村边，倒在池子里，我把铁锨一放，打算帮忙，可是刚到粪池旁边，就退了回来，感到桶里桶外都是粘糊糊的粪和尿，没法下手。她俩看透了我的心思，上去一手扒底，一手提桶，就把粪尿倒进了池子。粪尿溅了她俩一脸，可是她俩并不介意，用手一擦，就又说又笑地把车推走了。她们的这一行动，使我很受感动。心想：为什么都是一样的人，人家能干得出来，自己就做不到呢？回家后我打开毛主席著作，他老人家说：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”学习了毛主席的这一教导，我脸上热呼呼的，认识到：自己的立足点，还是小资产阶级的立场；粪桶并不脏，是自己的思想脏，要想彻底改造自己的世界观，就得下决心在劳动中和群众一起滚一身泥，出一身汗。从此我更加努力加强思想改造。
      在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼
    在同工农群众相结合的征途中，要经受住阶级斗争的考验和锻炼。我在高中读书时，阶级斗争观念不强，认为我国有七亿人口，有几个敌人也掀不起多大风浪，光我们民兵就能把他们收拾了。在无产阶级文化大革命中，面对面地和阶级敌人展开斗争，我才认识到，“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”随着运动的深入发展，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争越来越激烈。一些阶级敌人公开跳出来，破坏民兵学习毛主席著作。面对这些情况，我这个民兵营副营长，一方面和大家一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，一方面领导民兵同阶级敌人进行坚决斗争，终于击退了敌人的进攻。阶级敌人对这次失败，并不甘心。他们又施展新的阴谋，提出要
  “踢倒民兵营，夺取民兵的枪。”说什么“民兵营是保皇司令部，不打倒民兵营，就夺不了党支部的权。”他们把矛头直接对准了我，说我高中毕业回家，是为了升官发财，是为了在五公大队保耿家的天地。他们扬言，不搞掉耿惠娟，决不罢休。
    在阶级敌人的进攻面前，是畏缩不前，不敢斗争，还是发扬大无畏的革命精神，同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争呢？最初私字一下占了上风，认为自己毕业回村后，整天为集体操心，不图名，不图利，事事干在前头，现在敌人操纵一伙人和自己斗，真是划不来，干脆蹲在家里不动，他们对自己的攻击可能缓和一些。可是，一想到毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，就感到自己的想法完全错了。于是，我积极地和广大贫下中农一道同阶级敌人展开了斗争，写大字报揭露他们的反动事实，这样，一下子就把他们的反动气焰压了下去。通过这次斗争，使我再一次懂得，阶级斗争是长期的、尖锐的、复杂的，我一定要紧握手中枪，打击敌人，保卫文化大革命，保卫毛主席的革命路线。
    在运动中，为了进一步提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，我积极地参加了革命大批判。除写了几十篇批判文章外，还和民兵一起办了六块批判专栏，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”、
  “物质刺激”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命谬论，并对反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿抵制学习毛主席著作，搞大比武等滔天罪行，进行了大揭发，大控诉，大批判。
        把宣传毛泽东思想作为毕生的任务
    一九六七年十一月十三日，我在参加北京军区学习毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会期间，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副统帅接见了我们，这是我一生中最难忘的一天，也是我一生中最幸福的一天。象我这样一个贫农家庭出身的普普通通的女孩子，能见到全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席，这是多么幸福啊！我下定决心，要进一步把毛泽东思想学好、用好、宣传好，让全村、全县都变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新天地。
    我不放过宣传毛泽东思想的一切机会。有一回，我和一伙青年从地里回来，看见路口有一些牲口粪。我把自己拾的粪扔到了三队的地里，可是有个青年却把她拾的粪扔到自己所在的一队。我问她这是为什么，她说：“三队多打了粮食，又不叫咱一队吃，干什么扔在三队？”这件事看起来很小，但里面有个种田是为公还是为私的问题。于是，在地头学习班里，我组织大家学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》这两篇光辉著作，然后联系这件事情展开了讨论，使大家受到了一次深刻的教育，那个青年激动地说：“毛主席教导我们全心全意地为人民服务，可是我光看到咱一队这个天地，没有看到整个集体和整个革命。这是违背毛主席的教导的。”从此，这些青年一心为集体，在很多方面都表现了为革命种田的精神。
                        ×　×　×
    四年来，由于我听毛主席的话，走与工农相结合的道路，得到了群众的信任。我回乡不久，就被评为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，并被选为县革委会委员。但是，我深深感到，自己距离毛主席的要求还相差得很远。今后，我要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，更加认真地在实际斗争中锻炼和改造自己，决心把自己改造成一个有无产阶级觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。
