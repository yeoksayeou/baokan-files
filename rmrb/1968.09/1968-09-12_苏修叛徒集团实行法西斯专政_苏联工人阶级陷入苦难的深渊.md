    The editor's note: The key to distinguishing whether a country is under the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is to see what position the working class holds in that country—whether it is in a ruling position or a ruled position. In a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the working class must necessarily lead everything. Under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, regardless of the banner it raises, it must inevitably carry out brutal oppression and enslavement of the working class. This is determined by the nature of the bourgeoisie's plunder and exploitation.

    Today, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the Soviet working class has returned to the dark and miserable situation that existed before the October Revolution. They are politically persecuted and economically exploited, living in pain. In today's Soviet Union, capitalism has been fully restored, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has long been transformed into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, the fascist dictatorship. The following report is a vivid example of this.

    Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The Soviet working class has suffered twice because the power they won through heroic struggle was usurped by a group of traitors and revisionists. With power, the proletariat and the laboring people have everything; without power, they lose everything. The bitter lesson of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union tells us: the working class must never forget class struggle after seizing power and must firmly grasp and consolidate its own power, not relaxing for a moment. The working class must occupy all positions, and the working class must lead everything.

    New China News Agency, September 11: Our reporter's commentary: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has betrayed the proletarian revolution, implemented the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, transforming the great socialist state created by Lenin into a capitalist state, and transforming the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The Soviet working class, who were once the masters of the Soviet state, have had all their rights stripped away. Today, the working class and laboring people of the Soviet Union are subjected to brutal oppression, exploitation, and enslavement by the privileged bourgeoisie, falling into the depths of misery.

    Workers are oppressed everywhere

    The great Lenin once pointed out: "The proletariat should become the ruling class leading all laboring people, the ruling class in politics." Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet working class overthrew the rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie in the October Revolution, seized power, and for a long time held leading positions in various aspects of the Soviet state. For many years, they achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the anti-fascist war, writing glorious chapters in human history. Unfortunately, the Soviet working class, who had already seized power and become the ruling class, have now lost power. Losing power means losing everything. They now have no political rights, no life security, and no freedom of action. As an old worker said, "The dictatorship of the proletariat, the power of the working class, no longer exists in the Soviet Union." Another worker angrily said, "Now, workers are oppressed everywhere in the Soviet Union."

    After usurping the party and state power, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has strengthened the military, police, prisons, courts, and other state machinery under their control, implementing fascist dictatorship and spreading white terror over the Soviet working class and other laboring people. Anyone who dares to adhere to Marxism-Leninism, dare to struggle, and dare to resist will be surveilled, followed, interrogated, arrested, and imprisoned, or framed with trumped-up charges and sent to concentration camps, or suddenly "disappear" without a trace. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique adopts a savage policy of suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the working class. Last June, workers in the automobile industry in Chimkent, Central Asia, demonstrated against the Soviet police's unjustified shooting of a truck driver and attacked the headquarters of the public security bureau and nearby police stations. The Soviet authorities immediately revealed their ferocious nature by mobilizing tanks and armored vehicles to carry out a bloody suppression of the demonstrating workers, killing dozens on the spot and injuring and arresting many others. In Kharkov, the Soviet leaders also used force to suppress workers' strikes. In Georgia, a lumber worker was exiled to the border just for expressing dissatisfaction with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's anti-Stalin campaign. The persecution and suppression of the Soviet working class by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is even more brutal than the oppression of workers by imperialist rulers.

    Today, the Soviet Communist Party controlled by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long since degenerated from a Marxist-Leninist party into a revisionist party; from a proletarian party into a bourgeois party. The Soviet revisionist traitors have occupied various leadership positions in the party, pulling a large number of bourgeois elements into the party, and using every means to strike and exclude party members of worker origin and all genuine communists who adhere to Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has turned the party they control into a tool for the bourgeois privileged class to maintain their reactionary rule and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the working class.

    Brutal exploitation and enslavement

    Currently, the "new economic system" being vigorously promoted by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in various sectors of the Soviet national economy is a comprehensive retreat to capitalism. They replace the socialist planned economy and the principle of distribution according to labor with the capitalist profit law and free competition, turning enterprises originally under public ownership into enterprises owned by the bourgeois privileged class. This set of measures gives more and greater privileges to a small number of bourgeois privileged elements, making the working class completely degenerate into hired slaves.

    Those bourgeois elements disguised as "factory directors," "managers," and "experts" of various kinds, using their control and dominance over the means of production, act arrogantly and tyrannically, openly engaging in the business of oppressing and exploiting workers. These people treat the enterprises they control as tools for making money, engaging in free competition and speculation. These people brutally exploit workers, arbitrarily appropriating the fruits of workers' labor.

    These bourgeois privileged elements openly declare that they "can do whatever they want." The head of the sawmill and timber processing enterprise in Beslan, North Ossetia Autonomous Republic, relying on his power, arbitrarily imposes various penalties on workers or reduces their wages for one or two months. Anything can be a reason for him to punish workers. The head of an enterprise in Kirov Oblast, Russian Federation, established 223 items of penalties against workers in just one year, punished 125 people, and issued orders to 350 people to take material responsibility.

    The Soviet working class strongly resists and is indignant about the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's retrograde actions. This makes the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique tremble with fear. Therefore, in December 1966, they issued a so-called "resolution on strengthening labor discipline," claiming to fully utilize "administrative measures stipulated by law" to strengthen the role of the "Soviet Prosecutor's Office and the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union," using this to further oppress workers. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique takes revenge on workers who are dissatisfied with the status quo, lightly fining, punishing, demoting, and deducting wages, and severely expelling and even imprisoning them.

    The implementation of the "new system" has made the polarization of Soviet society even more acute. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique originally implemented a high-wage policy for enterprise managers, and the "new system" also stipulates that they can "self-determine" wages and bonuses, with bonuses being paid in proportion, the higher the wage, the more the bonus. A few percent of the Soviet population, the privileged class, are getting richer and richer, while more than 90% of the working class and other laboring people are getting poorer and poorer.

    The Soviet revisionist traitor clique deliberately creates a large unemployed population as an industrial reserve army to further intensify the exploitation of workers. Like capitalist enterprises, Soviet industrial and mining enterprises often dismiss workers in large numbers under the pretext of "reducing surplus personnel" and "streamlining the organization." A mechanical engineering management office with 350 people dismissed 318 people during the tenure of one of its directors. A road construction machinery station with 190 workers dismissed 79 people in one year. After the implementation of the "new system," five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad dismissed 239 people in just five months.

    When dismissing workers, women are particularly discriminated against. Many factories first dismiss women workers with many children, pregnant women who cannot work temporarily, and mothers nursing children under one year old. While dismissing a large number of workers, many factories also intensify the exploitation of apprentices and child laborers, forcing them to work like adults, even more than adults.

    Many dismissed workers are long-term unemployed and wander everywhere. Some lucky ones who are retained are also anxious and uncertain. Enterprise managers constantly intensify the exploitation of workers on the job, forcing them to take on the work of dismissed workers, with one person sometimes doing the work of two or three people. Some enterprises also invent various reasons to arbitrarily deduct workers' wages. In a coal mine in Rostov Oblast, workers should receive 13 rubles per day for their labor, but the mine head only gives them 3 rubles, with the rest being embezzled.

    The working class and peasant children find it difficult to enter school

    The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has occupied all cultural and ideological positions, controlling the leadership, making bourgeois ideology dominate the entire ideological and cultural field of today's Soviet Union. Bourgeois scholars and revisionist writers brazenly propagate reactionary revisionist ideas, decadent bourgeois lifestyles, and ugly "Western culture," corrupting and poisoning the Soviet people.

    Today, revisionist literature and art are important tools for the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to spiritually dominate the Soviet working class and other laboring people, completely serving the revisionist political line. In a large number of literary works published by the Soviet revisionists, they completely betray the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, fiercely attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, and maliciously slandering and defaming the working class. They vigorously depict war horrors, advocate the philosophy of survival, and promote material incentives, the omnipotence of the ruble, individualism, and other bourgeois ideas.

    The Soviet revisionists also, under the pretext of "Soviet-American cultural cooperation," frantically peddle the most reactionary, decadent, and ugly imperialist culture. They translate and publish a large number of extremely reactionary and decadent "literary" books from the United States in the Soviet Union. The editor of the Soviet "Literary Gazette" admitted in a conversation: "The best-selling books on the foreign book market in the Soviet Union are American novels." The Soviet music, dance, and theater stages are filled with low-level and vulgar jazz music, hoodlum dances, twist dances, and vulgar American plays. The Soviet screen has also become a tool for promoting "Western culture." The Soviet leaders admitted that there are often "hundreds of copies of American films" touring various places in the Soviet Union. After getting drunk and full, the Soviet revisionists also imitate the American way of life, frantically promoting nightclubs, strange clothes, and weird hairstyles. Today, the cultural field in the Soviet Union is shrouded in a thick fog.

    The Soviet revisionists hysterically curse the Soviet working class and laboring people as "ignorant people," abusing the laboring masses' just voices of opposition to the Soviet revisionists' restoration of capitalism in the cultural and artistic fields as the "voices of ignorant people." They, with the tone of bourgeois masters, shout about how the Soviet laboring people are "shallow in knowledge," "completely lack artistic sense," and are "outsiders," and threaten to put the laboring people in an "embarrassing situation."

    To adapt to their need for a comprehensive restoration of capitalism, the Soviet leadership implements a set of bourgeois school management policies and revisionist educational lines. They vigorously promote the bourgeois "expert management" school policy, making bourgeois scholars and reactionary "academic authorities" control the power of higher schools, monopolize everything, and sell various reactionary ideas as they please.

    In today's Soviet education, there is a clear class difference. On the one hand, the children of the bourgeois privileged class enjoy various superior conditions, doing whatever they want, and rising to prominence; on the other hand, the children of workers and peasants and laboring youth are subjected to exclusion and attacks.

    According to Soviet publications, it is now very difficult for the children of the Soviet laboring people and laboring youth to enter higher schools, and a few who enter higher schools may be "eliminated" at any time. An article in the "Soviet Russia" newspaper said that the "number of people eliminated in the past five years at Ural University has almost doubled," and "most of them are people with work experience." "The number of students eliminated in the Mechanics and Mathematics Department accounts for one-fourth of the enrolled students," and many people were eliminated due to "material reasons," "family conditions," and so on.

    Soviet publications also openly applaud the evil deeds of higher schools excluding working-class and peasant youth and children of workers and peasants, shouting in the tone of bourgeois masters that allowing "doormen, clerks, salespeople, etc." to enter the university is "absurd." They also slander laboring youth as "people who lack ability and are unwilling to dedicate themselves to science."

    Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Soviet Communist Party is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the people, the broad masses of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and revolutionary, and the rule of revisionism will not last long." The Soviet revisionist traitors' brutal oppression and exploitation of the working class will definitely not escape historical punishment. The Soviet working class and laboring people with a glorious revolutionary tradition are constantly strengthening their revolutionary struggles and will surely ultimately overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    苏修叛徒集团实行法西斯专政  苏联工人阶级陷入苦难的深渊
    编者按：鉴别一个国家是无产阶级专政，还是资产阶级专政，其重要标志就是看工人阶级在这个国家中占据什么地位，是占据统治地位，还是处于被统治的地位。在无产阶级专政的国家里，必然是工人阶级领导一切。资产阶级专政，不管它打着什么旗号，必然要对工人阶级进行残酷的压迫和奴役，这是资产阶级的掠夺和剥削的本性所决定的。
    今天，在苏修叛徒集团的统治下，苏联工人阶级又回复到十月革命前那种黑暗、悲惨的处境之中。他们在政治上横遭迫害，在经济上备受压榨，过着痛苦的生活。在今日的苏联，资本主义已经全面复辟，无产阶级专政早已变为资产阶级专政、法西斯专政。下面的报道，就是这方面一个活生生的材料。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”苏联工人阶级所以吃二遍苦，处于今天这种受压迫、被奴役的地位，就是因为他们英勇战斗所赢得的政权，被一批叛徒、修正主义分子篡夺去了。有了政权，无产阶级、劳动人民，就有了一切；没有政权，就丧失一切。苏联复辟资本主义的惨痛教训告诉我们：工人阶级在夺得政权之后，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，必须牢牢地掌握和巩固自己的政权，一时一刻也放松不得。工人阶级必须占领一切阵地，工人阶级必须领导一切。
    新华社十一日讯　本社记者述评：苏修叛徒集团背叛无产阶级革命，在苏联实行资本主义的全面复辟，把伟大列宁亲手缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家变成资本主义国家，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，剥夺了曾经是苏维埃国家主人的工人阶级的一切权利。今天，苏联的工人阶级和劳动人民，受着资产阶级特权阶层的残酷压迫、剥削和奴役，陷入苦难的深渊之中。
    工人处处受压迫
    伟大的列宁曾经指出：“无产阶级应当成为领导全体劳动人民的统治阶级，成为政治上的统治阶级。”苏联的工人阶级在列宁和斯大林的领导下，在十月革命中推翻地主资产阶级的统治，夺取政权后，在苏维埃国家的各个方面，长期居于领导地位。多年来，他们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反法西斯战争中，取得了伟大的胜利，在人类历史上写下光辉的篇页。但是，不幸的是，已经夺取政权，并成为统治阶级的苏联工人阶级今天又失掉了政权。失去了政权，也就失去了一切。他们现在政治上没有权利，生活上没有保障，行动上没有自由。正如一位老工人说的，“无产阶级专政，工人阶级的政权，在苏联已经不存在了”。另一位工人愤慨地说，在苏联，“现在，工人处处受压迫”。
    苏修叛徒集团在篡夺党政大权后，极力强化他们所控制的军队、警察、监狱、法庭等国家机器，对苏联工人阶级和其他劳动人民实行法西斯专政，大搞白色恐怖。谁要是敢于坚持马克思列宁主义，敢于斗争，敢于反抗，谁就会被监视、钉梢、传讯以至逮捕和监禁，或者以莫须有的罪名被关进集中营，或者无缘无故地突然“失踪”。苏修叛徒集团对工人阶级的革命斗争采取野蛮的镇压政策。去年六月，苏联中亚细亚奇姆肯特市的汽车工人因抗议苏修警察当局无故枪杀一名汽车司机而举行了示威，并袭击了市民警总部和附近的派出所。苏修当局马上凶相毕露地调动坦克和装甲车，对示威工人进行血腥镇压，当场打死数十人，打伤和逮捕很多人。在哈尔科夫，苏修头目也曾用武力镇压过工人们的罢工斗争。在格鲁吉亚，一位木材工人，只是因为表露出对苏修叛徒集团大反斯大林的不满情绪，就被流放边疆。苏修叛徒集团对苏联工人阶级的迫害和镇压，同帝国主义国家统治者残暴镇压工人相比，是有过之而无不及的。
    今天由苏修叛徒集团所控制的苏联共产党，早已经从马克思列宁主义的党蜕化成为修正主义政党；从无产阶级政党蜕化成为资产阶级政党。苏修叛徒们窃踞了党的各级领导岗位，把大批资产阶级分子纷纷拉入党内，对工人出身的党员和一切坚持马克思列宁主义的真正的共产党人，千方百计地进行打击和排斥。苏修叛徒集团使他们所操纵的党，完全成为资产阶级特权阶层维持其反动统治和镇压工人阶级革命斗争的工具。
    残酷的剥削和奴役
    目前，苏修叛徒集团正在苏联国民经济各部门加紧推行的“经济新体制”，是全面地向资本主义的大倒退。他们用资本主义的利润法则和自由竞争代替社会主义的计划经济和按劳分配原则，把原来属于全民所有制的企业变成资产阶级特权阶层所有制的企业。他们搞的这一套，给予一小撮资产阶级特权阶层分子更多和更大的特权，使工人阶级完全沦为雇佣奴隶。
    那些披着“厂长”、“经理”和“专家”等形形色色外衣的资产阶级分子，利用他们把持和支配生产资料的特权，飞扬跋扈，横行霸道，明目张胆地干着压迫和剥削工人的勾当。这些人把自己所掌握的企业当成发财致富的工具，大搞自由竞争和投机倒把活动。这些人残酷地压榨工人，任意侵吞工人的劳动成果。
    这些资产阶级特权阶层分子公然叫嚷，他们“想怎样干，就怎样干”。北奥塞夏自治共和国农业部所属的贝斯兰市锯木制材企业的领导人加扎洛夫，依仗权势，随便宣布给工人以各种处分，或降低工人一两个月的工资。什么事情都可以成为他对工人进行惩罚的理由。俄罗斯联邦基尔罗伏州一个企业的负责人，仅在一年内就私立二百二十三项对工人的惩罚条例，还处罚了一百二十五人，对三百五十人下达了追究物质责任的命令。
    苏联工人阶级对苏修叛徒集团的倒行逆施表示了强烈的抵制和愤慨。这使勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团胆战心惊。于是，他们在一九六六年十二月搞了一个所谓“加强劳动纪律的决议”，扬言要充分利用“法律规定的行政措施”，加强“苏联检察机关和苏联最高法院”的“作用”，以此来进一步压迫工人。苏修叛徒集团对一些不满现状的工人进行打击报复，轻则罚款、处罚、降职、克扣工资，重则开除，以至坐牢。
    推行“新体制”的结果，使苏联社会的两极分化更加尖锐。苏修叛徒集团本来就对企业负责人实行高工资政策，“新体制”又规定他们可以“自定”工资和奖金，而奖金又是按比例发的，工资越高，奖金越多。占苏联人口百分之几的特权阶层分子越来越富，占人口百分之九十以上的工人阶级和其他劳动人民越来越穷。
    苏修叛徒集团故意造成一个庞大的失业队伍作为产业后备军，以便进一步加重对工人的剥削。象资本主义国家的企业一样，苏联工矿企业为了牟取暴利，常常借口“裁减多余人员”和“紧缩编制”，大量解雇工人。有一个机械工程管理处共有三百五十个人，但在这个处的一个主任的任职期间，就先后解雇了三百一十八人。还有一个修路机械站共有一百九十个职工，一年当中就开除了七十九人。在实行“新体制”以后，莫斯科和列宁格勒五家汽车公司在五个月内就解雇了二百三十九人。
    在解雇工人时，妇女特别受到歧视。许多工厂首先解雇多子女的女工、暂时不能工作的孕妇和喂养周岁以下孩子的母亲。在大量裁减工人的同时，许多工厂还加重剥削徒工和童工，强迫他们同成年工人一样劳动，甚至超过成年工人。
    许多被解雇的工人长期找不到工作，到处流浪。
  一些侥幸被留下来的人，也是提心吊胆，朝不保夕。企业负责人对在职的工人不断加重剥削，强迫他们代替被解雇工人的工作，一个人甚至要干两个人到三个人的活。有些企业还巧立名目，任意克扣工人的工资。在罗斯托夫州一个煤矿中，工人每天劳动应得工资十三个卢布，但这个矿的头头只发给他们三个卢布，其余的都被吞没掉了。
    工农子弟入学难
    苏修叛徒集团霸占了一切文化思想阵地，操纵着领导大权，使资产阶级意识形态统治了今日苏联的整个思想文化领域。资产阶级学阀和修正主义文人，肆无忌惮地宣扬反动的修正主义思想、腐朽的资产阶级生活方式和丑恶的“西方文化”，腐蚀和毒害苏联人民。
    今天，修正主义的文学艺术，是苏修叛徒集团对苏联工人阶级和其他劳动人民实行精神统治的重要工具，是完全为修正主义政治路线服务的。苏修叛徒在大量出版的文艺作品中，彻底背叛了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，疯狂攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，恶毒诽谤和丑化工人阶级。他们极力渲染战争恐怖，鼓吹活命哲学，宣扬物质刺激、卢布万能、个人第一等等资产阶级思想。
    苏修叛徒还在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，拚命贩卖最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的帝国主义文化。他们在苏联大量翻译出版美国反动透顶、糜烂不堪的“文学”书籍。苏修《文学报》主编在一次谈话中供认：“苏联外国书籍市场上的畅销书是美国小说”。在苏修的音乐、舞蹈和戏剧舞台上，充满着低级下流的靡靡之音——爵士音乐，阿飞舞、摇摆舞、扭摆舞等黄色舞蹈和反动的庸俗的美国戏。苏修的银幕也成为宣扬“西方文化”的工具。苏修头目承认，经常有“几百部美国电影拷贝”在苏联各地巡回演出。苏修叛徒在酒醉饭饱之余，还模仿美国的生活方式，大搞胡作非为的夜总会，推销奇装异服和怪发型等等。今天苏联的文化领域里笼罩着一片乌烟瘴气。
    苏修叛徒歇斯底里地破口大骂苏联工人阶级和劳动人民“无知之徒”，谩骂劳动群众反对苏修在文化艺术领域内复辟资本主义的正义吼声是“无知之徒的声音”。他们以资产阶级老爷的口吻叫嚷什么苏联劳动人民是“知识浅薄”、“完全缺乏艺术感”和“外行”，并且气势汹汹地威胁说要把劳动人民置于“难堪的境地”。
    苏修领导集团为适应其全面复辟资本主义的需要，在教育方面推行一整套资产阶级的办校方针和修正主义的教育路线。他们竭力推行资产阶级“专家治校”的办校方针，使资产阶级学阀、反动的“学术权威”操纵高等学校大权，垄断一切，任所欲为地贩卖各种反动思想。
    在苏联今天的教育中，明显地存在着阶级差别，一方面是资产阶级特权阶层的子弟享受着种种优越条件，为所欲为，飞黄腾达；另方面是工农劳动人民的子弟和劳动青年，遭受排挤和打击。
    据苏修报刊透露，现在苏联劳动人民的子弟和劳动青年很难进入高等学校，少数进入高等学校也随时可能被“淘汰”。《苏维埃俄罗斯报》的一篇文章说，乌拉尔大学“最近五年淘汰的人数几乎增加了两倍”，其中“有工龄的人占多数”。“力学数学系被淘汰的学生占入学人数的四分之一”，许多人是由于“物质原因”、“家庭条件”等等被淘汰的。
    苏修报刊还公然为高等院校排斥工农青年和工农子女的罪恶行径叫好，以资产阶级老爷的腔调叫嚷说，让“守门人、文书、售货员等等”进入大学是“奇谈怪论”。它们还诽谤劳动青年是“既没有能力，又不愿献身于科学的人”。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏修叛徒残酷地压迫和剥削工人阶级，绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。具有光荣革命传统的苏联工人阶级和劳动人民正在不断加强革命斗争，他们一定会最后推翻苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政。
