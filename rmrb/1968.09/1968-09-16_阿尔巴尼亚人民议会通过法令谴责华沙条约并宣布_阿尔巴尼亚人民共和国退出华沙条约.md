The decree states: The actions of the Soviet government and some other member governments of the Warsaw Pact have violated the basic clauses of the treaty and completely deviated from the purpose of concluding the treaty. All their activities are based on the imperialist aim of Soviet-American collusion to dominate the world and harm the fundamental interests of the peoples of various countries. The decree says that the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria shows that the Warsaw Pact has been most brutally trampled upon and has turned from a means of defending against imperialist aggression into a means of attacking its own member countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 15 - The sixth session of the sixth session of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania was held solemnly in Tirana on September 12 and 13. The session passed a decree condemning the Warsaw Pact and announcing Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.

The great leader of the Albanian people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Enver Hoxha, and the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Mehmet Shehu, and other leaders of the Albanian Party and state attended the meeting.

This meeting was held at the request of the Albanian government and in accordance with the resolution of the fifth plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour held on September 5. Comrade Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, made a report at the meeting on condemning the Warsaw Pact and Albania's withdrawal from this pact.

The meeting discussed Comrade Shehu's report and fully agreed with it. The meeting passed a decree on September 13. The decree pointed out that the Warsaw Pact was originally concluded to jointly ensure the security of these countries from imperialist aggression, especially from the aggression of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led by American imperialism; it was to strengthen the comprehensive cooperation of socialist countries on the basis of the lofty principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. However, the actions of the Soviet government and some other member governments of the Warsaw Pact have violated the basic clauses of the treaty and completely deviated from the purpose of concluding the treaty. All their activities are based on the imperialist aim of Soviet-American collusion to dominate the world and harm the fundamental interests of the peoples of various countries. The decree says that the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria shows that the Warsaw Pact has been most brutally trampled upon and has turned from a means of defending against imperialist aggression into a means of attacking its own member countries.

The decree announces that the People's Republic of Albania no longer assumes any obligations under this treaty.

In addition to the representatives of the People's Assembly, representatives of the working people and mass organizations of factories, enterprises, and cultural and educational institutions in Albania also attended this meeting.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Albania were also invited to attend this meeting.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会通过法令谴责华沙条约并宣布
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约
    法令指出：苏联政府以及华沙条约其他一些成员国政府的行动，违反了条约的基本条款，完全背离了缔结条约的宗旨。它们的全部活动完全是从苏美勾结主宰世界，损害各国人民根本利益的帝国主义目的出发。法令说，苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、保加利亚对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略表明，华沙条约已遭到了最粗暴的践踏，已从一个防御帝国主义侵略的手段变成一个进攻它自己成员国的手段。
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会第六届第六次会议于九月十二日和十三日在地拉那隆重举行。会议通过一项法令，谴责华沙条约，并宣布阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查以及阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡和阿尔巴尼亚党和国家其他领导人出席了会议。
    这次会议是应阿尔巴尼亚政府的请求、并根据九月五日召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第五次全体会议的决议而举行的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡在会上作了关于谴责华沙条约和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出这个条约的报告。
    会议讨论了谢胡同志的报告并表示完全赞同这个报告。会议在十三日通过了一项法令。法令指出，华沙条约的缔结本来是为了以共同力量保障这些国家的安全，不受帝国主义的侵略，特别是以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋集团的侵略；是为了加强社会主义国家在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义崇高原则基础上的全面合作。但是，苏联政府以及华沙条约其他一些成员国政府的行动，违反了条约的基本条款，完全背离了缔结条约的宗旨。它们的全部活动完全是从苏美勾结主宰世界，损害各国人民根本利益的帝国主义目的出发。法令说，苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、保加利亚对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略表明，华沙条约已遭到了最粗暴的践踏，已从一个防御帝国主义侵略的手段变成一个进攻它自己成员国的手段。
    法令宣布，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国不再承担这个条约所规定的一切义务。
    出席这次会议的除人民议会代表外，还有阿尔巴尼亚的工厂企业、文化教育机构的劳动人民和群众组织的代表。
