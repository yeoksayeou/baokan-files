To the Editor:

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Most or a large majority of students trained in old-style schools can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and innovations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcome by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's great teaching is extremely correct and wise, pointing out a bright path for us who have been trained in old-style schools. From the practice of the past few years, I deeply feel that students trained in old-style schools must undergo re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers and must thoroughly reform their old ideas. Only in this way can they be welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

I graduated from Shenyang Mechanical School in 1965. Due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, I had a strong desire for personal fame and fortune. After graduation, I wanted to go to a big city and work in a large factory to become an engineer. However, after graduation, I was assigned to Yangyuan Agricultural Tools Factory as a technician, which made me very unhappy. Soon after arriving at the factory, the factory began the trial production of a grinding machine and asked me to design it. At that time, I thought that after studying mechanical principles for a few years, this task would be easy to complete. Initially, I stayed in a small room and read many books. With great difficulty, I drew the blueprints. I thought it would be fine. However, when I showed it to the old workers, they all said it wouldn't work. They gave me many suggestions and offered design opinions. Some old workers even helped me with the design. However, due to the deep influence of revisionism, I was still not convinced at that time and did not humble myself to listen to the workers' valuable suggestions. Thus, I did a second design by myself. The result was still unsatisfactory. Seeing this situation, many old workers studied Chairman Mao's works with me. Chairman Mao taught: "Intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants; otherwise, they will accomplish nothing." Through the study, I deeply realized that whether or not to combine with workers is the final dividing line between revolution and non-revolution; it is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. I decided to learn from the workers, work with them, and complete this task together. I took the blueprints to the workshop and discussed and improved them with the workers. With the help of the workers, after more than ten revisions, I finally designed a relatively ideal blueprint.

The factory was small and the equipment was poor, and there was no experience, so many difficulties arose during the trial production. Faced with difficulties, I was a bit discouraged and wanted to give up, revealing the weakness of intellectuals. However, the workers were full of enthusiasm. They said: With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we can create any miracle. Some workers were so busy that they forgot to eat, and some workers worked for days without rest, repeatedly conducting experiments, and summarizing lessons from each failure. The workers' thorough revolutionary spirit deeply educated me, making me more determined to combine with the workers. I ate, lived, and studied with the workers, and together we summarized experiences and lessons. After dozens of experiments, we finally successfully produced a 66-type universal crusher. The facts educated me: "The masses are the real heroes"; combining with workers means victory, and not combining with workers means failure. From then on, I moved my bed to the workers' dormitory and lived with them, often learning from the workers. I learned their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; I learned their hardworking and simple style, and I decided to completely change my non-proletarian thoughts. I did whatever the workers did, and if I didn't understand, I asked them. After a period of labor practice, the worker comrades said: We welcome such technicians. I think this is the greatest encouragement from the worker comrades.

In the future, I will listen to Chairman Mao more and walk the path of combining with workers and peasants for life.

    必须接受工农兵的再教育
    编辑同志：
    毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席这一伟大教导，无比英明正确，为我们从旧学校培养出来的学生，指出了一条光明的大道。从几年来的实践中，我深深地体会到，从旧学校培养出来的学生，必须接受工农兵的再教育，必须彻底改造旧思想，只有这样，才能受到工农兵的欢迎。
    我是一九六五年从沈阳机械学校毕业的，由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害，个人成名成家思想比较严重。毕业后，一心想到大城市，进大工厂，将来当一个工程师。结果，毕业后把我分到阳原农具厂当技术员，心里就很不舒服。来厂不久，厂里开始磨面机的试制工作，叫我设计。当时我认为学了几年机械原理，这个任务一定容易完成。开始，我钻在小房子里翻了好多书，好容易把图纸画了出来，我满以为准行。谁知，拿给老工人一看，都说不行。他们纷纷给我出主意，提出设计的意见。有的老工人还和我一起搞设计。可是由于我受修正主义的毒害太深，当时还不服气，没有放下知识分子的臭架子，对工人提出的宝贵意见听不进去。于是，我一个人又进行了第二次设计。结果搞出来还是不象样子。看到这种情况，好多老工人就和我一起学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”通过学习使我深刻地认识到：愿意不愿意同工人相结合是革命和不革命的最后分界线；是对毛主席，对毛泽东思想忠不忠的大问题。我决心拜工人为师，向工人学习，和工人一起完成这项工作。我把画好的图纸拿到车间和工人们一起研究，边讨论，边改进。在工人们的帮助下，经过十多次的修改，终于设计出一种比较理想的图纸。
    厂子小设备差，又加上没经验，试制工作中出现了很多困难。在困难面前，我有些灰心，想打退堂鼓，暴露了知识分子的弱点。但是工人们个个干劲十足。他们说：有毛泽东思想作指南，什么人间奇迹也可以创造出来。有的工人忙得忘了吃饭，有的工人坚持工作好几天都不休息，反复进行试验，失败一次总结一次教训。工人们的彻底革命精神深深地教育了我，使我更加坚定了同工人相结合的决心。我和工人们同吃、同住、同研究，共同总结经验教训，经过几十次的试验，终于试制成功了一台66型的万能粉碎机。事实教育了我：“群众是真正的英雄”，同工人结合就是胜利，不同工人结合就一事无成。从此以后，我把被子搬到工人宿舍里，和工人住在一起，经常向工人学习。学习他们忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的高贵品质；学习他们艰苦朴素的优良作风，下决心脱胎换骨改造自己的非无产阶级思想。工人们怎样干，我就怎样干，不懂就向他们请教。经过一个时期的劳动锻炼，工人同志们说：我们欢迎这样的技术员。我认为这是工人同志对我最大的鼓励。
    今后我要更加听毛主席的话，一辈子走与工农相结合的道路。
