The sun shines on the snowy mountains, turning the peaks red, and the blue sky stretches for miles with red clouds flying. The Monba people are spreading the joyous news: the Revolutionary Committee of Tibet has been established! Old Ro Sang's heart is stirred, and tears of happiness stream down his face. How many times has he held up a cup of qingke liquor, gazing towards Beijing? The first generation of workers on the plateau, Xia Qiang Ba, is busy hanging up portraits of Chairman Mao. They hang them in tents, at village entrances, and along the roads, and the golden sun shines on a million homes on the plateau. Old Ama holds a bowl of butter tea, standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and speaks from her heart: "Chairman Mao, the golden flowers of Tibet bloom thanks to your sunlight. The happiness of the Monba people today is all because of you." Little Da Ji skillfully embroidered a sun, stitching the heartfelt words of the emancipated serfs: "Every red heart is loyal to Chairman Mao, and snow lotuses bloom on the plateau." The villages of the Monba people are red all around, and the tents shine brightly inside and out. The joyous celebration covers the mountains and rivers of the nation in red, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has bloomed in victory. The emancipated serfs do not offer tsampa or khadas, but have a thousand and ten thousand heartfelt words, following the distant-flying wild geese to Beijing, to offer to Chairman Mao.

    翻身农奴心向毛主席
    雪莲太阳照红雪山顶，碧空万里飞红霞，门巴族家家传喜讯：西藏革委会成立啦！年迈的罗桑心激动，幸福的泪水满腮挂，多少次捧着青稞酒，向着北京把眼望花。高原第一代工人小强巴，忙把毛主席彩像挂，挂满帐篷、村口和路旁啊，金太阳照红雪山千万家。老阿妈手捧一碗酥油茶，站在毛主席像前把言发：毛主席啊，藏金花开全凭阳光照，门巴族今日幸福全靠您老人家。小达吉巧手绣太阳，绣上翻身农奴的贴心话：颗颗红心忠于毛主席，高原盛开朵朵雪莲花。门巴族村前村后红彤彤，帐篷里里外外放光华，喜庆全国山河一片红啊，文化大革命开出胜利花。翻身农奴不献糌粑和哈达，有千句万句知心话，随着远飞的大雁到北京，献给毛主席他老人家。
