	The Worker Propaganda Team Solved the "Old Difficult" Problems

	The Chaoyang District Hospital in Changchun was a unit that had not done a good job in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Some "old difficult" problems had long remained unsolved. After the worker propaganda team entered the hospital, they vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, closely united with the broad revolutionary masses, and made the hospital's appearance completely new.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: A unit in Changchun that had not done a good job in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation—Chaoyang District Hospital—after the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team moved in, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were quickly implemented, and some long-standing "old difficult" problems were solved. The entire hospital's appearance has been completely renewed.

	Chaoyang District Hospital is a district-level hospital in Changchun. It was formed by merging several small clinics. Under the protection of Khrushchev and his agents, a small handful of bad elements in this hospital had not been touched during any political movements. Because of the bad elements in charge, some bad practices and habits in the hospital had long remained uncorrected. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of class enemies fanned the flames of struggle, stirring up internal strife between the two revolutionary factions, and the lid of class struggle had not been lifted. Revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who came here for treatment were very dissatisfied with this situation, especially with the hospital often using the "public rest" excuse to turn away patients. They said: "Public rest, public rest, this hospital really openly rests."

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." The Changchun Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recently organized a worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, including representatives from the People's Liberation Army, to enter this hospital. They are determined to fully bring into play the leading role of the working class, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of this unit, and change the backward appearance of this unit.

	How can the working class lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation work well? The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered the hospital, under the leadership of the Changchun Revolutionary Committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts. Chairman Mao taught us: "Dialectical materialism holds that external causes are the conditions of change, while internal causes are the basis of change. External causes operate through internal causes." Chairman Mao also said: "We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, not only seeing the positive side of things but also seeing the negative side. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results." After in-depth study and discussion, they unanimously agreed: Although this unit has many problems, there are still positive factors. As long as we firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely unite with and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, we will definitely be able to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation work of this unit well. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went to various departments, had extensive contact with the broad revolutionary staff, had heart-to-heart talks, and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes together, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and carrying out bitter-sweet remembrance activities. In this way, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary staff was quickly aroused, and their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness were raised. The revolutionary staff of this hospital said that the class struggle within our hospital is like a duck swimming, from afar the water surface looks calm, but up close you can see some ripples, and if you go deeper into the water, you will see "black claws" stirring. But this situation had not been noticed in the past. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the revolutionary staff of this hospital together launched a high tide of deep exposure and deep excavation of class enemies, lifted the lid of class struggle in the hospital, and in more than ten days, they exposed three deeply hidden class enemies. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and closely uniting with the broad revolutionary masses, solved one by one the so-called "old difficult" problems of this hospital.

	Now, the revolutionary situation in this hospital is excellent. The hospital's appearance has been completely renewed. The work style and thought style of the broad revolutionary staff have changed greatly. The hospital enthusiastically serves the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever patients come, they are treated immediately, doing their best to help the revolutionary masses in urgent need. They also sent out mobile medical teams to go deep into the countryside, welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

    工人宣传队解决了“老大难”问题
    长春朝阳区医院是一个没搞好斗批改的单位，一些“老大难”问题长期得不到解决。工人宣传队开进医院以后，大力宣传毛泽东思想，紧紧团结广大革命群众，使这个医院面貌焕然一新
    据新华社长春电　长春市一个还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位——朝阳区医院，在进驻工人毛泽东思想宣传队以后，毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速得到落实，一些很长时期得不到解决的“老大难”问题得到了解决，全院面貌焕然一新。
    朝阳区医院是长春市的区属医院，是由过去几个联营小医院组织起来的。在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的庇护下混在这个医院中的一小撮坏人，在历次政治运动中都没有被触动过。由于坏人当道，医院中的一些坏作风、坏习气长期得不到改造。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人煽阴风，点鬼火，挑动医院内的两派革命群众内战不休，阶级斗争盖子一直没有揭开。来到这里看病的革命工人和贫下中农对这种情况非常不满，特别对这个医院常常用“公休”的挡箭牌把病人拒之门外很有意见。他们说：“公休，公休，这个医院真是公开地修掉了。”
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”长春市革委会根据毛主席的最新指示，不久前组织了一支有解放军代表参加的工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻这个医院，决心充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，搞好这个单位的斗批改，改变这个单位的落后面貌。
    工人阶级怎样才能领导好斗、批、改工作？进驻医院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在市革委会的领导下，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，反复学习了毛主席的哲学思想。毛主席教导我们：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”毛主席又说：“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果”。他们经过深入学习和讨论，一致认为：这个单位虽然存在着许多问题，但仍然存在着积极因素，只要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧紧地团结和依靠广大革命群众，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，就一定能领导好这个单位的斗、批、改工作。工人毛泽东思想宣传队分头下到各科室，同广大革命职工广泛接触，一起谈心，一起开办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，开展忆苦思甜活动。这样，就很快激发了广大革命职工的革命热情，提高了他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。这个医院的革命职工说，我们医院内的阶级斗争，很象鸭子浮水，远看水面很平静，近看能够发现点波纹，再深入到水里去看，就会看到“黑爪子”在水里乱划。可是这种情况，过去就没有引起注意。工人毛泽东思想宣传队和这个医院的革命职工一道掀起了深揭深挖阶级敌人的高潮，揭开了医院阶级斗争的盖子，在十多天的时间里，就挖出了三个隐藏很深的阶级敌人。工人毛泽东思想宣传队靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠紧紧团结广大革命群众，使这个医院的所谓“老大难”问题一个个得到了解决。
    现在，这个医院的革命形势大好。医院的面貌焕然一新。广大革命职工的工作作风和思想作风有了很大改变。医院热情为工人和贫下中农服务，病人什么时候来，他们就什么时候就诊，做到急革命群众之所急，帮革命群众之所需。他们还派出巡回医疗队深入农村，受到广大贫下中农欢迎。
