Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the Fushun Cement Plant Revolutionary Committee firmly implements democratic centralism and plays a collective leadership role. With the help of military representatives, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the plant's revolutionary committee consciously execute democratic centralism and the party's mass line. Everyone has more ideas and discussions, creating a lively and vibrant political atmosphere.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 9th: The military representatives of the Fushun Cement Plant Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "whether inside or outside the party, there must be a full democratic life, that is, democratic centralism must be seriously implemented," firmly and unwaveringly take the lead in executing the principles of democratic centralism in the context of local cadres' deep respect and trust for military representatives. This has further strengthened the connection with the masses, promoted the revolutionary transformation of the leadership cadre, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary committee.

After the establishment of the Cement Plant Revolutionary Committee, significant achievements have been made in leading the entire plant's workers to seize the revolution and promote production. Yu Zengliang, the committee's director and military representative, always remembers Chairman Mao's teaching of "vigilance against arrogance" and constantly checks for shortcomings in the committee's work, actively seeking everyone's opinions on improving the committee's work. Once, some grassroots cadres said: "In the revolutionary committee, the military representative has the best style, the highest prestige, and handles issues decisively. As long as the military representative speaks, the lower levels will definitely act quickly and execute well..."

This praise led Yu Zengliang to deep reflection. He compared it with Chairman Mao's teaching on "the party committee system is an important party institution that ensures collective leadership and prevents individual despotism." From the praise, he thought about how, since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, he had done more and helped other committee members less. He deeply felt that whether or not to fully play the role of collective leadership was not just a matter of work methods and style, but a major issue of whether to firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and unwaveringly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, Yu Zengliang made a serious self-criticism at the committee meeting and suggested that the committee must strengthen democratic centralism. Subsequently, he organized the committee members to review, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, the lessons from the past when some cadres deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line due to their arbitrary and autocratic behavior. They severely criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in suppressing democracy, promoting a "one-man show," and implementing bourgeois dictatorship, raising everyone's awareness of the importance of adhering to and implementing democratic centralism.

On the basis of raising awareness, the committee, after thorough discussion, took a series of measures to strengthen democratic centralism. The main practices are as follows: First, establish a system of collective leadership and individual responsibility for division of labor. Major issues are discussed and decided collectively, then executed according to the division of labor, firmly overcoming the tendency of a few people making decisions. Second, in addition to professional divisions, the standing committee members also go to the workshops for in-depth work, managing both "vertical" (one aspect of work) and "horizontal" (overall work of a grassroots unit) responsibilities. This allows committee members to both handle their assigned work and understand the overall situation, facilitating mutual communication and a common language in studying and solving problems. Third, before making major decisions, the committee actively seeks the opinions of non-full-time committee members and holds full committee meetings to fully promote democracy and collectively study issues. Before full committee meetings and standing committee meetings, notices are issued in advance to inform everyone of the issues to be discussed and solved, allowing for early preparation and broad consultation with the masses. Fourth, hold democratic life meetings and heart-to-heart talks. When committee members have problems, they put them on the table, conduct criticism and self-criticism, eliminate differences, and strengthen unity. Additionally, the committee has drastically streamlined the organization, changed the bureaucratic style, implemented work at the grassroots level, labor in the workshops, and provided face-to-face leadership to the grassroots, studying, laboring, and fighting alongside the masses. This has resulted in clear situations, firm resolve, appropriate methods, and received praise from the masses.

After strengthening the collective leadership of the revolutionary committee, the democratic atmosphere has thickened, and during meetings, there are more ideas and discussions. For example, after the struggle against the enemy deepened, some committee members advocated rounding up a few people who were used by class enemies to do bad things and criticizing them together. This issue was discussed for a long time at the committee meeting without reaching a unified understanding. Yu Zengliang, the committee director and military representative, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching on "in all practical work of our party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." Then, he led everyone to the masses to broadly listen to their opinions. Some old workers said well: without strictly distinguishing between enemy and people's internal contradictions, it is impossible to win over the majority and accurately and decisively strike a small number of real class enemies. Committee members went deep into workshops and teams, studying the enemy struggle strategy with the masses, then brought the masses' opinions back, and after serious discussion, reached a unified understanding. They accurately and decisively struck a small number of class enemies, strongly consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee. After doing this, the committee members received great education.

To seriously implement democratic centralism and fully play the role of collective leadership, the military representatives of the plant's revolutionary committee also guided everyone to respect the opinions of the minority. Not long ago, committee members had a dispute over an issue. The military representative thought the minority's opinion was correct but did not rush to express it. Instead, after the meeting, he talked to the majority of the committee members, presenting facts and reasoning patiently to do ideological work, leading everyone to reach a unified opinion. Through this incident, everyone further realized: the revolutionary committee can only avoid subjectivism and form a correct and genuine centralism by listening to different opinions.

Under the help and model influence of the military representatives, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary mass representatives of this plant's revolutionary committee can consciously execute democratic centralism and the party's mass line, and use this as an important standard to measure whether they are firmly executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. All levels of revolutionary committees in the plant, on the basis of fully promoting democracy and following the mass line in everything, have strengthened centralized and unified leadership, doing their best to promote correct opinions in line with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly opposing and resisting any speech and action that goes against Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the military representatives, the Fushun Cement Plant Revolutionary Committee firmly implements democratic centralism, fully plays the role of collective leadership, and has better played the role of the revolutionary committee as a fighting fortress, forming "a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, with a unified will and individual hearts content, lively and vibrant."

    遵照毛主席的教导坚定不移地实行民主集中制
    抚顺水泥厂革委会发挥集体领导作用
    在军队代表的帮助下，厂革委会的革命干部和革命群众代表，自觉地坚持执行民主集中制和党的群众路线。大家主意多了，议论多了，出现了生动活泼的政治局面
    据新华社沈阳九日电抚顺水泥厂革命委员会的军队代表，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“不论党内党外，都要有充分的民主生活，就是说，都要认真实行民主集中制”的伟大教导，在地方干部非常尊重和信赖军队代表的情况下，坚定不移地带头执行民主集中制原则，充分发挥集体领导作用，进一步密切了同群众的联系，促进了领导班子思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命委员会。
    水泥厂革命委员会成立以后，在领导全厂职工抓革命、促生产中，取得了很大成绩。厂革命委员会主任、军队代表于增良，牢记毛主席“力戒骄傲”的教导，时刻注意检查革委会工作中的不足，主动征求大家对改进革委会工作的意见。一次，有的基层干部说：“在革委会里，数军队代表作风好，威信高，处理问题雷厉风行，只要军队代表发话，下边保准行动快，执行的好……”。这一番赞扬，引起了于增良的深思。他对照毛主席关于“党委制是保证集体领导、防止个人包办的党的重要制度”的教导，从赞扬中联想到革委会成立以来自己干的多，帮助其他委员发挥作用少，深深感到，能不能充分发挥集体领导作用，这绝不是一般工作方法和作风问题，而是关系到能不能坚决照毛主席的教导办事，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的大问题。因此，于增良便在革委会上做了认真的自我检查，并建议革委会一定要把民主集中制健全起来。接着，他又组织革委会成员对照毛主席的教导，回忆厂内一些干部过去由于包办代替、独断专行而背离毛主席革命路线的教训，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫压制民主，大搞“一言堂”，实行资产阶级专政的滔天罪行，提高了大家对坚持执行民主集中制重要性的认识。
    在提高认识的基础上，革委会经过充分研究，采取了一系列加强民主集中制的措施。主要做法是：一，健全集体领导和个人分工负责的制度。凡是重大问题，都经过集体讨论决定，然后按照分工分头执行，坚决克服少数人说了算的不良倾向。二，革委会常委除有专业分工外，还分头到车间蹲点，做到既管“条条”（一个方面的工作），又管“块块”（一个基层单位的全面工作），使革委会成员既掌握分担工作，又了解全面情况，研究问题和处理问题能够“互通情报”，有共同语言。三，革委会决定重大问题，都事先主动征求不脱产委员意见，并且召开全体委员会议充分发扬民主，集体研究。全体委员会议和常委会议开会前，都提前发“安民告示”，让大家知道要讨论什么问题，解决什么问题，早作准备，广泛征求群众意见。四，开民主生活会和谈心会。革委会成员之间有了问题，就把问题摆到桌面上，开展批评与自我批评，消除分歧，增强团结。此外，革委会还大刀阔斧地精简了机构，改变了机关化的作风，实行工作在基层，劳动在车间，对基层进行面对面的领导，跟群众同学习、同劳动、同战斗，做到了情况明、决心大、方法对，受到群众好评。
    革委会集体领导加强以后，民主空气浓了，开会的时候，主意多，议论多。例如对敌斗争深入开展以后，革委会有个别成员主张把几个被阶级敌人利用，干了一些坏事的群众一块揪出来批斗。这个问题提出来以后，在革委会上讨论了很长时间，得不出统一的认识。革委会主任、军队代表于增良就组织大家学习毛主席关于“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，然后带领大家到群众中去，广泛听取群众的意见。有些老工人说得好：不严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，就不能争取团结多数，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮真正的阶级敌人。革委会成员分头深入到车间班组，和群众一块研究对敌斗争策略，然后把群众的意见带上来，经过认真讨论，取得了一致认识，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，有力地巩固了新生的革命委员会。这样做了以后，使革委会成员受到很大教育。
    为了认真实行民主集中制，充分发挥集体领导作用，厂革委会的军队代表，还注意引导大家尊重少数人的意见。不久前，革委会成员对一个问题发生了争执。军队代表认为少数常委的意见是对的，但没有急忙表态，而是会后找多数常委谈心，向他们摆事实，讲道理，耐心做思想工作，使大家取得了一致意见。通过这件事，使大家进一步认识到：革委会只有听取不同意见，才能避免主观主义，形成正确的真正的集中。
    在军队代表的帮助和模范作用的影响下，这个厂革委会的革命干部和革命群众代表，都能自觉地坚持执行民主集中制和党的群众路线，并且以此作为衡量自己是否坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线的重要标准。全厂各级革命委员会都在充分发扬民主，事事走群众路线的基础上，加强了集中统一领导，做到了凡是符合毛泽东思想的正确意见，就集中发扬；凡是违背毛泽东思想的言论和行动就坚决反对和加以抵制。抚顺水泥厂革命委员会在军队代表带动下，坚定不移地实行民主集中制，充分发挥集体领导作用，使革命委员会的战斗堡垒作用得到了更好的发挥，形成了“又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”。
