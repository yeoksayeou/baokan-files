In the cities of Congo (Kinshasa), especially in Kinshasa, the rent is so high that it far exceeds the burden that ordinary citizens can bear. In Kinshasa, over the past year, rents have increased by three to four times. The general rent is three to ten zaïres per month (one zaïre is equivalent to two dollars), while the monthly salary of an ordinary worker is less than five zaïres. Workers have no choice but to cram several families into a single damp and dirty room. Even more impoverished workers, unable to afford the rent, are evicted by the landlord and forced to wander the streets. Every night, along the roadsides of Kinshasa, one can see groups of laboring people huddled around bonfires, spending the night outdoors.

    劳动人民流落街头
    在刚果（金）城市里，特别是在金沙萨，房租高得远远超过一般市民的负担。在金沙萨，一年来，房租增加了三至四倍，一般房租每月在三到十个宰里（一个宰里合两块美元），而普通工人的每月工资还不足五个宰里。工人们只好几家人挤在一间潮湿肮脏的房子里；有更多的贫苦工人由于付不起房租而被房主赶出家门，流落在街头。每到夜晚，在金沙萨的马路旁，到处都可看到一群群劳苦人民围着一堆堆篝火，露天过夜。
