In the triumphant songs of achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, the national textile industry presents a new face. The production of major products has been increasing month by month in the first eight months of this year. Since September, the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has seen even greater growth, and the quality of the products is improving. Currently, a wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is surging forward.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated September 23, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, in the triumphant songs of achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, the revolution and production of China's textile industry are presenting a new face. The flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely on the textile industry front, and a wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is surging forward. The revolution powerfully promotes production. The textile industry production levels of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Heilongjiang, which account for nearly half of the national textile equipment, have all created historical highs this year.

According to statistics, in the first eight months of this year, the production of various major products in China's textile industry has increased month by month, with significant growth each month. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter saw a 40% increase in cotton yarn production and a 43% increase in cotton cloth production. In July and August, these two major products again saw an 11% increase compared to the second quarter. Since entering September, textile workers across the country have increased production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to welcome the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The quality of the products is improving.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary cadres of the textile industry have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, actively implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the great call to "grasp the cloth tightly," and insisted on leading production with revolution. The broad revolutionary cadres have always held high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the region and unit, and carried out a revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism has greatly heightened the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary cadres, promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and driven the work of cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, and reforming unreasonable regulations. The Shanghai textile workers, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have, after achieving victory in the January Revolution seizure of power, insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, eliminated the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, achieving one victory after another in revolution and production. The revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Knitting Factory, on the basis of achieving double victories in revolution and production last year, have continued to strive for further progress, and have excellently completed the production tasks assigned by the state month after month in the first eight months of this year. The revolutionary cadres of the Shijiazhuang Dyeing Factory, through a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "experts managing the factory," have reformed unreasonable regulations, implemented a three-in-one combination of workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres in technical management, greatly unleashed the production enthusiasm and creativity of revolutionary cadres, and carried out mass technical innovation and technological revolution activities that are both spectacular and solid. The factory's production level has exceeded the design capacity by one fold, realizing "one factory becomes two," and has completed this year's production tasks three and a half months ahead of schedule.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in the struggle." The broad revolutionary cadres of the textile industry have studied Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions again and again. Old workers from textile industry enterprises in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places have conducted recollections and comparisons during the study of Chairman Mao's instructions. They have expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the fastest and most decisive actions. In the past more than a month, textile industry enterprises across the country, under the unified leadership of the local revolutionary committees, have successively selected tens of thousands of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which have marched into schools and units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform to lead the proletarian education revolution and the struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure and other fields. The revolutionary cadres who remain in the factory have bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. Many textile industry enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and other provinces and cities have, despite the selection of about 10% of the workers, not only not affected the revolution and production in their factories but have also done a better job in all aspects of work. They have achieved major victories in large-scale criticism, cleaning up class ranks, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and completing production tasks.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary cadres of the textile industry have launched a wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. After the establishment of revolutionary committees, textile industry enterprises across the country have universally carried out the work of cleaning up class ranks, streamlining organizations, and dispatching a large number of technical personnel and management cadres to the production front line to lead the revolution and promote production together with the workers, accepting re-education from the working class. Currently, the broad revolutionary cadres of the textile industry are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and fight a good fight in struggle, criticism, and reform to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中
    全国纺织工业战线革命生产呈现新面貌
    今年头八个月主要产品产量月月上升，九月份以来，棉纱和棉布的生产又有更大的增长，产品质量越来越好。目前，一个斗批改的高潮正在蓬勃兴起
    据新华社二十三日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国纺织工业战线的革命和生产正呈现出崭新的面貌。革命大批判的烈火在纺织工业战线越烧越旺，一个斗、批、改的高潮蓬勃兴起。革命有力地推动了生产。占全国纺织设备将近一半的北京、上海、天津、河北、山东、江西、黑龙江七省、市，纺织工业的生产水平，今年以来都创造了历史的最高纪录。
    据统计，今年头八个月，我国纺织工业各种主要产品的产量，一月比一月高，月月大幅度上升。第二季度同第一季度相比，棉纱产量增长百分之四十，棉布产量增长百分之四十三。七、八两月，这两种主要产品又都比第二季度增长百分之十一。进入九月以来，各地纺织工人为了迎接中华人民共和国成立十九周年，棉纱和棉布的生产又有更大的增长。产品质量越来越好。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，纺织工业战线的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极落实毛主席的一系列最新指示和“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，坚持以革命统帅生产。广大革命职工始终高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，深入持久地对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，开展了革命的大批判。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，推动了清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构和改革不合理的规章制度等项工作。具有光荣革命传统的上海纺织工人，在取得“一月革命”夺权斗争胜利以后，始终坚持开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，使革命和生产取得了一个又一个的胜利。北京针织总厂革命职工在去年取得革命和生产双胜利的基础上，再接再厉，乘胜前进，今年头八个月月月都出色地完成了国家交给的生产任务。石家庄印染厂的革命职工通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货，改革了不合理的规章制度，在技术管理上实行工人、革命的技术人员和革命干部的三结合，大大发挥了革命职工的生产积极性和创造性，群众性的技术革新和技术革命活动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，使工厂的生产水平超过设计能力一倍，实现了“一厂变两厂”，已经提前三个半月完成了今年的生产任务。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”纺织工业战线上的广大革命职工，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的这一光辉指示。上海、江苏、青岛、天津、武汉等地纺织工业企业的老工人，在学习毛主席这一指示时，进行了回忆对比。他们表示，一定要用最迅速最坚决的行动，落实毛主席的最新指示。最近一个多月以来，各地纺织工业企业在当地革命委员会的统一领导下，先后抽调了数万优秀工人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡地开进了学校和一些没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，去领导无产阶级教育革命和上层建筑及其他领域的斗、批、改。留在厂里的革命职工，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。北京、上海、山东、天津、江苏、河北、河南等省、市的许多纺织工业企业，在抽调了百分之十左右工人的情况下，不但没有使本厂的革命和生产受到影响，而且把各项工作做得更好，在大批判、清理阶级队伍、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度中，在完成生产任务中，都取得了重大胜利。
    纺织工业战线广大革命职工在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。各地纺织工业企业在建立革命委员会以后，普遍开展了清理阶级队伍工作，精简机构，下放大批技术人员和管理干部到生产第一线，同工人一起抓革命、促生产，接受工人阶级的再教育。目前，纺织工业战线上的广大革命职工，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真打好斗、批、改这一仗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
