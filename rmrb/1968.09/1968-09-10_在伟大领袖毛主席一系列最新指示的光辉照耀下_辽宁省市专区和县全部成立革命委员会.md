In the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all cities, special districts, and counties in Liaoning Province. All levels of revolutionary committees in the province are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing into the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the struggle to seize power and promote production, they are fully playing the leading role of the working class and striding forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 9th: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary committees have been established in all ten cities, four special districts, one reclamation area, and forty-one counties in Liaoning Province, a major industrial base in China. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The working class and the broad revolutionary masses of Liaoning Province, with the support of the great People's Liberation Army of China, have followed Chairman Mao's call to "unite the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." They have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning, achieving a great victory in May this year and establishing the provincial revolutionary committee. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, the working class continues to advance along the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao, firmly grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle by focusing on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The revolutionary situation in the province is getting better and better, and revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are being consolidated and developed. Following the establishment of revolutionary committees in cities like Anshan, the steel capital, and Fuxin, the city of coal and electricity, and in special districts and counties, revolutionary committees have been established from Jinzhou outside the Shanhaiguan Pass to Dandong by the Yalu River, from the coal and iron city of Benxi to the port city of Lüda. By August 28th, the revolutionary committee of Fushun, the coal capital, was also born in victory. Thus, all cities, special districts, and counties in the province have established revolutionary committees.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work must be fully brought into play." The newly established revolutionary committees at all levels in Liaoning Province, in the struggle to seize power and promote production, firmly rely on the working class and the reliable allies of the working class, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and lead millions of people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are everywhere in the cities and countryside of the province. Revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in the study classes are fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, effectively promoting the revolutionization of thought. Under the leadership of the working class, the broad revolutionary masses throughout the province are deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism, continuing to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and striking at a handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely. The revolution has powerfully promoted the development of production. The output of major industrial products such as steel, coal, and machinery in the province is increasing steadily, and the transportation volume of railways and ports is also increasing. New products, new technologies, and new records are emerging one after another. The agricultural production situation is also good.

Under the leadership of the working class, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary masses throughout the province are fiercely criticizing the reactionary bourgeois theory of "multiple centers is no center," closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unifying their understanding, steps, and actions. Many places have further achieved and consolidated revolutionary unity according to systems, industries, and classes. The province has presented a grand scene of unprecedented unity under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters.

Chairman Mao recently issued a great call to the whole country to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Liaoning Province has entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers are marching into colleges and universities and all units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers have played a powerful role, and many long-standing contradictions in "difficult" units have been solved as soon as the teams arrived. The revolutionary committees at all levels in Liaoning Province are determined to more closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully play the leading role of the working class, fight a good battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and stride forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!
