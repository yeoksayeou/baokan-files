Chairman Mao is Our Savior

“Chairman Mao: It is you who saved our lives. We express our heartfelt gratitude to you and your people. We wish you eternal life!”

This was the message of gratitude sent by the Pakistani and Jordanian sailors from the Greek ship Captain G. after it encountered a severe typhoon and ran aground off the southwest coast of Daxing Mountain in Huidong County, Guangdong Province, and sank. The sailors were rescued and sent this message to the great teacher, Chairman Mao.

On the evening of August 21, 1968, the Greek ship Captain G., carrying 10,350 tons of fertilizer, was passing through the waters southwest of Daxing Mountain in Huidong County, Guangdong Province, when it was suddenly hit by a severe typhoon. The ship's engines failed, and the 10,000-ton vessel was lifted by the typhoon and struck the reef, splitting into two parts. One part fell onto the rocks by the shore, and the other part sank into the sea. At this time, the typhoon was still raging, and giant waves were crashing into the ship's cabins one after another. The damaged Captain G. was slowly sinking, and the sailors' lives were in grave danger.

Upon hearing the news, the militiamen, civilians, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China from Huidong County's Gangkou Commune, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, took Norman Bethune as their shining example, displayed internationalism, fought against the raging winds, braved the treacherous waves, and risked their lives to rescue the sailors from the sea that night. Due to hunger and the battering of the wind and waves, the sailors were exhausted, some seriously injured, and some fainted. The local people immediately organized a rescue effort. When the sailors came to, they found themselves lying in comfortable guest rooms. The people standing before them all had shining badges of Chairman Mao on their chests, and the walls were adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. The sailors' hearts swelled with emotion, tears of joy streamed down their faces, and they all raised their thumbs at Chairman Mao's portrait, nodding repeatedly and saying, “Mao Zedong is great! China is good!” They then eagerly asked our staff for badges of Chairman Mao. When the staff fulfilled their request and gave each of them a shining badge of Chairman Mao, they were overjoyed. They held the badges, gazing at them lovingly, then pressed them to their hearts, and finally pinned them neatly on their chests. They summed up their feelings in one sentence: “Mao Zedong is great! Long live Chairman Mao!”

After medical treatment and careful nursing, the sailors quickly recovered. When they were about to leave Gangkou Commune, they were deeply moved. They all dressed neatly, put on the badges of Chairman Mao that we had given them, and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to take commemorative photos.

    毛主席是我们的救命恩人
    “毛主席：是您救了我们的生命，我们对您和您的人民表示衷心的感谢，敬祝您万寿无疆！”
    这是希腊卡普特恩·吉号商船在我广东省惠东县大星山西南海面，遇强台风触礁沉船后，被救的巴基斯坦和约旦籍海员给伟大导师毛主席的致敬电。
    一九六八年八月二十一日晚，希腊卡普特恩·吉号商船，载着一万零三百五十吨化肥，路过广东省惠东县大星山西南海面时，遇到强台风的突然袭击，机器全部失灵，这艘万吨巨轮被强台风腾空掀起碰礁而分成两半，一截掉落在岸边的礁石上，一截掉在海中。这时，台风还在刮个不停，巨大的浪头一个接一个地打进卡普特恩·吉号船的船舱里。毁坏了的卡普特恩·吉号商船在慢慢地下沉，海员的生命处在万分危急之中……。
    我惠东县港口公社的民兵、群众和中国人民解放军闻讯后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以白求恩同志为光辉榜样，发扬国际主义精神，战狂风，顶恶浪，冒着生命危险，连夜把海员从大海中抢救起来。由于饥饿和风吹浪打，海员们已精疲力尽，有的受了重伤，有的昏倒在地。当地群众立即组织抢救。当海员们苏醒过来时，发现自己躺在舒适的招待房里，站在自己面前的人个个胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，房间的墙壁上挂着毛主席像和毛主席语录。顿时，海员们热血涌心头，喜泪往下流，个个竖起大拇指对着毛主席像连连点头说：“毛泽东伟大！”“中国好！”随后，他们为了表达对伟大领袖毛主席的真挚的阶级感情，个个殷切地向我们的工作人员要毛主席像章。当工作人员满足了他们的要求，给了他们每个人一枚光芒四射的毛主席像章时，他们欣喜若狂。他们捧着毛主席像章，一时爱不释手地凝视着，一时紧紧地贴在心窝，然后端端正正地佩戴在自己的胸前，把千言万语，万语千言，归结成一句话：“毛泽东伟大！毛主席万岁！”
    经过医疗和细心照料，海员们很快恢复了健康。当海员们要离开港口公社的时候，他们怀着万分激动的心情，个个整整齐齐地穿好了衣服，把我们送给他们的毛主席像章全部戴上，对着镜子照了又照，然后站在毛主席像前拍照留念。
