Dong Lequn is the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Dongxing Health Materials Factory in Tianjin.

There is a worker in the drying workshop named Yi Jinmei. She is diligent and responsible in her work, straightforward in her personality, and never beats around the bush when speaking. She is known in the factory as a "straight shooter." Whenever she sees Dong Lequn doing something inappropriate, regardless of how many people are present, she will "boom boom boom" and fire off a few shots. Not long after, Dong saw that Yi Jinmei kept "booming" at him, so he thought she was a "troublemaker" and usually avoided her, rarely going to the drying workshop for labor.

Unconsciously, the two had a knot in their minds.

Recently, Dong Lequn, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on how to handle the relationship between cadres and the masses. He realized: If the members of the Revolutionary Committee cannot correctly handle the masses' criticisms and cannot unite the masses around them, they cannot lead the masses to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. He decided to correct his attitude towards the masses.

One afternoon, when he went to the drying workshop to labor, he mustered the courage to ask Yi Jinmei, "Old Yi, can we chat and talk after work?" To his surprise, Yi Jinmei angrily said, "I'm a 'troublemaker,' we have nothing to talk about!" This made him blush.

One day after work, he went to Yi Jinmei's home to apologize. As soon as he entered the door, he saw Yi Jinmei lying on the bed resting. Since the two had not spoken for a long time, Yi Jinmei still had a grudge in her heart. When she saw Dong, she not only did not get up but also covered her head with the quilt and did not say a word. Dong saw this scene and got angry, turning around and walking out. He thought: You, Old Yi, are really a bit "unappreciative," let's just not talk to each other.

Back at the factory, with the enlightenment of the stationed soldiers, he studied Chairman Mao's teachings again: "Without boundless enthusiasm, without the determination to look down, without the desire to learn, without the spirit of putting down one's airs and becoming a small student, one will definitely not be able to do it and definitely will not be able to do it well." He reflected on his own actions in finding Yi Jinmei, and asked himself: Why did Yi Jinmei cover her head and not speak? Why couldn't I take the initiative to apologize to her, but turned around and left? Why did I blame her for being "unappreciative" on the way back? That night, he made up his mind to go to Yi Jinmei's home again to apologize. Just as he was about to enter the house, he suddenly heard Yi Jinmei talking to her husband and children, and stopped in his tracks. He thought: "If I go to Old Yi to make a self-criticism, and she pushes me back in front of her family, that would be embarrassing!" At this moment, Chairman Mao's teachings about "putting down one's airs and becoming a small student" echoed in his ears. He immediately realized: Fear of this and that is all because of the "self."

So, Dong mustered his courage again and walked into the house. As soon as he saw Yi Jinmei, he said, "Old Yi, I've come to make a self-criticism!" Then, in front of her family, he sincerely made a self-criticism. Yi Jinmei saw that Dong had visited her three times and sincerely made a self-criticism, and was very moved. She also immediately examined her past shortcomings of not paying attention to the manner and attitude of giving suggestions. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the knot in the two people's minds finally unraveled.

    三访奕金梅
    董乐群是天津市向东卫生材料厂革委会副主任。
    烘干车间有个工人叫奕金梅，工作积极负责，性情直爽，说话从不拐弯抹角，是厂里有名的“炮筒子”。她一看到董乐群做了什么不合适的事，不管当着多少人的面，“轰轰轰”就是几炮。日子不长，小董看到奕金梅老是“轰”自己，就认为她是个“刺儿头”，平时就有意避着她，跟班劳动也很少到烘干车间去。无形中，两人思想上结下了疙瘩。
    前些日子，董乐群在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传组的帮助下，反复学习了毛主席关于搞好干部和群众的关系的最新指示，他认识到：革委会成员如果不能正确对待群众的批评，不能把广大群众团结在自己的周围，就不能率领群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。他下决心端正自己对群众的态度。
    一天下午，他到烘干车间跟班劳动的时候，就鼓起勇气问奕金梅：“老奕，下班后咱们聊聊天，谈谈心，好吗？”那知奕金梅气呼呼地说：“我是‘刺儿头’，咱俩没啥可谈的！”一下子把他闹了个大红脸。
    有一天下班后，他又找到奕金梅的家里，准备向她道歉。他刚进门，见奕金梅正躺在床上休息。因两人长时间不说话，奕金梅心里还窝着一股气。她看到小董来了，不但没起来，还用被子把头一蒙，一句话也不说。董乐群一看这场面，心里一气，扭头走了出来。心想：你老奕也真有点“不识抬举”，干脆咱谁也别理谁了。
    回到厂里，在驻厂解放军同志的启发下，他又学习了毛主席的教导：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”他对照自己这次找奕金梅的前前后后，不禁问自己：为什么奕金梅蒙住头不说话？我为什么不能主动找她道歉，而是扭头走了出来？为什么回来的路上还怪她“不识抬举”？晚上，他下定决心，再一次到奕金梅家来道歉。他刚想进屋，忽然听见奕金梅正和她的爱人、孩子说话，又停住了脚步。心想：“我找老奕作检讨，要是她当着爱人、孩子的面再把我顶回来，那多难看呀！”这时，毛主席关于“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”的教导又在他耳边响起。他立刻想到：怕这怕那，都是“私”字作怪。
    于是，小董又鼓足劲头儿，走进了屋里。一见面，他就冲着奕金梅说：“老奕，我向你作检讨来了！”接着，就当着她们一家老少的面，诚恳地作了自我批评。奕金梅看到小董三番五次找自己，并诚恳地作了自我批评，很受感动。她也立刻检查了自己过去提意见不注意方式方法、态度生硬的缺点。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，两人的思想疙瘩终于解开了。
