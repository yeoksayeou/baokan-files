A workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College, is transforming the college in the image of the working class. They are helping revolutionary teachers and students overcome the bourgeois bad academic style of theory divorced from practice and inconsistency between words and deeds. They are promoting a proletarian revolutionary good academic style of theory linked with practice and learning integrated with application. This has effectively advanced the revolutionary great alliance and the struggle-criticism-reform, making the college's political face completely renewed.

	New China News Agency, Guangzhou, September 12 — A workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, mainly composed of workers and with the participation of soldiers from the Guangzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army, has been stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College since early August. They have been using the great Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the broad revolutionary teachers and students, transforming the college in the image of the working class. This has effectively advanced the revolutionary great alliance and the struggle-criticism-reform in the college, making the college's political face completely renewed.

	The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, in exercising firm proletarian political leadership over the college, has placed great importance on helping revolutionary teachers and students overcome the bourgeois bad academic style of theory divorced from practice and inconsistency between words and deeds, and on promoting a proletarian revolutionary good academic style of theory linked with practice and learning integrated with application. After entering the college, they found that some intellectuals did not seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, but instead eagerly discussed "small talk," falling far behind the magnificent strides of the billion revolutionary masses. To address this situation, the workers and soldiers of the propaganda team first brought a thick proletarian political atmosphere into the college. They posted portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao all over the college, wrote Chairman Mao's latest instructions into large banners to cover up the slogans serving bourgeois factionalism, and helped teachers and students organize revolutionary song-singing activities, quickly changing the political atmosphere of the college. Next, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team organized all revolutionary teachers and students to carry out a revolutionary criticism campaign, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the latest battle orders from the proletarian headquarters as weapons. Together with the teachers and students, they fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and fiercely criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center means no center" theory. In carrying out these activities, the comrades of the propaganda team followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," and universally talked with teachers and students. They used numerous vivid facts of the working class's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to enlighten the teachers and students to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to be consistent in words and deeds, to unify their understanding, steps, and actions under the orders of the proletarian headquarters. A student whose ancestors for three generations were poor peasants was a leader of a mass organization with serious bourgeois factionalism. When the workers' propaganda team required revolutionary teachers and students to level the hills and achieve revolutionary great alliance to jointly fight against the enemy, he showed indifference. Aiming at his active thoughts, the comrades of the workers' propaganda team patiently talked with him, explaining that loyalty to Chairman Mao should not stop at words but should be seen in actions. Through the enthusiastic help of the comrades of the workers' propaganda team, the student raised his proletarian consciousness, voluntarily examined his erroneous thoughts, and took the lead in leveling the hills. Through the patient help and education of the workers' propaganda team, the broad revolutionary teachers and students deeply realized that the attitude towards the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters is a fundamental issue of a revolutionary's standpoint, a worldview issue, and also an issue of whether one has the determination to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. They expressed their determination to follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao like the working class, to seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and to resolutely carry them out. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire college raised their proletarian consciousness, corrected their academic style, quickly exposed a handful of class enemies who incited the masses to fight each other, sabotaged the revolutionary great alliance, and sabotaged the struggle-criticism-reform, leveled the hills, and further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance in terms of ideology and organization.

	The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team also found in Sun Yat-sen Medical College that some people, due to their worldview not being well transformed, took a utilitarian attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions, even distorting the highest instructions. The worker comrades and soldiers firmly grasped this fundamental issue, educating the intellectuals to understand Chairman Mao's instructions from the standpoint and viewpoint of the proletariat and to implement Chairman Mao's instructions. As soon as the propaganda team entered the college, they proposed to concentrate time to hold study classes and seriously carry out the struggle-criticism-reform. However, some students said, "Chairman Mao wants us to 'resume classes and make revolution,' we cannot spend the whole day holding study classes, we need to spend half a day attending classes." After investigation, it turned out that these people demanded "resuming classes" from the bourgeois "self" standpoint, thinking that if they did not learn some skills, they would not be able to be doctors. Therefore, they wanted to invite the reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" and "professors" back to the lectern. The comrades of the workers' propaganda team deeply criticized these students' utilitarian erroneous attitude and style towards Chairman Mao's great instruction of "resuming classes and making revolution." The comrades of the workers' propaganda team pointed out that our resumption of classes is not a return to the old, but to first resume the course of Mao Zedong Thought and the course of class struggle. The workers' propaganda team insisted on concentrating time to hold large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, guiding the broad revolutionary teachers and students to seriously carry out the struggle-criticism-reform. Now, the entire college has held 180 study classes, with more than 90% of the revolutionary teachers and students participating in the study. In the study classes, worker comrades stood on the university lectern, teaching the broad teachers and students the course of class struggle, using their own bitter family history before liberation and their personal experiences as well as the real materials of class struggle in their units as teaching materials, giving everyone a profound and vivid education on class and class struggle. The sufferings of the working class in the old society aroused the painful memories of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, and the entire college immediately launched a mass "two remembrances and three examinations" activity: that is, remembering the bitterness of the old society and the bitterness of the bourgeois intellectuals ruling Sun Yat-sen Medical College; examining one's standpoint, fighting spirit, and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Through class education, the broad teachers and students greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, united as one, jointly fought against the enemy, promoted the deep development of the struggle against the enemy, and exposed a handful of hidden class enemies.

	Some students in this college, poisoned by the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, looked down on labor and despised workers and peasants. Under the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, some people became "one year of dirt, two years of foreign influence, three years of not wearing patched clothes, four years of urgently finding a partner, five years of graduation but not willing to go to the countryside." During the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary Red Guards rose up to rebel against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the college, seizing their power. However, due to a handful of class enemies inciting the two factions to fight each other for a long time, the college's struggle-criticism-reform basically did not proceed, and the bourgeois ideology of looking down on labor and despising workers and peasants did not receive a powerful criticism. Even cleaning the ground and sweeping the sanitation were things that teachers and students did not do, still specially done by workers. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team decided to use their actions to re-educate the teachers and students. They took the initiative in everything during school life, sweeping the rooms when they were dirty, cleaning the toilets themselves, and going to the kitchen, garage, and wards to work in shifts, taking the lead in doing whatever work they saw. The teachers and students saw the actual actions of the workers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, receiving great education. Some said, "We are studying medicine, but we do not pay attention to hygiene ourselves and let workers and soldiers clean for us, which is truly shameful." Some students posted big-character posters to examine their "clothes come to hand, food comes to mouth" young master and miss style, expressing their determination to learn from the working class, actively participate in physical labor, and thoroughly change the bourgeois ideology of despising labor and looking down on the working-class masses. Some graduating students, who were initially not satisfied with being assigned to the countryside, compared with the sublime qualities of the working class, said with great shame, "If we are still unwilling to go to the countryside, we truly do not deserve the cultivation of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants."

	Now, a mass struggle-criticism-reform high tide has been set off in Sun Yat-sen Medical College. The entire college presents a prosperous scene. Revolutionary teachers and students praise, "The contradictions that we have been entangled in for a long time and could not solve, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team came and quickly solved them." They said, "Practice has proven that the educational revolution of the proletariat cannot rely solely on us intellectuals, but must have the strong leadership of the working class. We must definitely accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform our bourgeois worldview, and carry the educational revolution of the proletariat through to the end."

    用毛泽东思想对革命师生进行再教育
    进驻中山医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，按工人阶级的面貌改造学院，帮助革命师生克服理论脱离实际、言行不一的资产阶级坏学风，大立理论联系实际、学用一致的无产阶级革命好学风，有力地促进了革命大联合和斗批改，使学院的政治面貌焕然一新
    新华社广州十二日电　一支以工人为主体、有人民解放军广州部队指战员参加的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，从八月初进驻中山医学院以后，用伟大的毛泽东思想向广大革命师生进行再教育，按照工人阶级的面貌来改造学院，有力地促进了学院的革命大联合和斗、批、改，使学院的政治面貌焕然一新。
    进驻学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队在对学院实行坚强的无产阶级政治领导中，把帮助革命师生克服理论脱离实际、言行不一的资产阶级坏学风，大立理论联系实际、学用一致的无产阶级革命好学风，放在重要地位。他们进驻学院后发现，有些知识分子，对毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，不认真学习和贯彻，而对那些“小道消息”却津津乐道，以致远远落后于亿万革命群众胜利前进的雄伟步伐。针对这种情况，宣传队的工人同志和指战员们首先把浓厚的无产阶级政治空气带进学院。他们在学院里到处贴起伟大领袖毛主席的画像和毛主席语录，把毛主席的最新指示写成巨幅标语，盖掉那些为资产阶级派性服务的口号，并帮助师生员工开展大唱革命歌曲等活动，迅速改变了学院的政治空气。接着，工人毛泽东思想宣传队又组织全院革命师生员工开展革命的大批判，以毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的最新战斗号令为武器，同革命师生员工一起，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义谬论，狠批反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”。在开展这些活动中，宣传队的同志遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，普遍找师生谈心，他们以工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大量生动事实，启发师生们紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，言行一致，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。一个祖辈三代都是贫农的学生，是一个群众组织的头头，资产阶级派性严重，工人宣传队要求革命师生铲平山头，实现革命的大联合，共同对敌，他表示冷淡。针对他的活思想，工人宣传队的同志就耐心地和他交谈，说明忠于毛主席，不能停留在口头上，而是要看行动。经过工人宣传队同志的热情帮助，这个学生提高了无产阶级觉悟，主动检查了自己的错误思想，带头铲平了山头。通过工人宣传队的耐心帮助和教育，广大革命师生深刻认识到：对伟大领袖毛主席的指示抱什么态度，对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令抱什么态度，这是一个革命者的根本立场问题，是一个世界观问题，也是有没有决心将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的问题。他们表示，决心象工人阶级那样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对毛主席的指示要认真落实，坚决照办。全院革命师生员工提高了无产阶级觉悟，端正了学风，很快揪出了挑动群众斗群众，破坏革命大联合，破坏斗、批、改的一小撮阶级敌人，削平山头，从思想上、组织上进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在中山医学院还发现，有些人由于世界观没有很好的改造，对毛主席的指示采取实用主义的态度，甚至歪曲最高指示。工人同志和指战员们紧紧抓住这个带根本性的大问题，教育知识分子以无产阶级的立场、观点来理解毛主席的指示，落实毛主席的指示。宣传队一进学院，提出要集中时间办学习班，认真搞好斗、批、改。而有些学生却说：“毛主席要我们‘复课闹革命’，不能全天拿来办学习班，要拿出半天时间上课。”经过调查了解，原来这些人所以要求“复课”，是从资产阶级“私”字出发，他们认为，再不学点技术，医生就当不成了。因此，他们要把反动的资产阶级学术“权威”“教授”重新请上讲台。工人宣传队的同志就深刻地批判了这些学生对毛主席“复课闹革命”的伟大指示采取的实用主义的错误态度和作风。工人宣传队的同志指出，我们复课决不是复旧，而是要首先复毛泽东思想课，复阶级斗争课。工人宣传队坚持集中时间，大办毛泽东思想学习班，引导广大革命师生认真搞好斗、批、改。现在全院已举办一百八十个学习班，百分之九十以上的革命师生参加了学习。在学习班里，工人同志登上了大学的讲台，向广大师生员工讲阶级斗争课，用自己解放前的苦难家史和亲身经历以及本单位阶级斗争的现实材料作教材，对大家进行深刻而生动的阶级和阶级斗争的教育。工人阶级在旧社会的苦难遭遇，激起了广大革命师生的痛苦回忆，全院立即掀起了一个群众性的“两忆三查”活动：即忆旧社会的苦、忆资产阶级知识分子统治中山医学院的苦；查立场、查斗志、查两条路线斗争觉悟。广大师生员工通过阶级教育，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，大家团结一致，共同对敌，推动了对敌斗争的深入发展，挖出了一小撮隐藏的阶级敌人。
    这个学院的一些学生，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害下，轻视劳动，瞧不起工农。在资产阶级思想侵袭下，有些人变得“一年土，二年洋，三年不穿补衣裳，四年急着找对象，五年毕业不肯下乡。”无产阶级文化大革命中，革命师生、革命的红卫兵小将，奋起造了学院党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权。但是，由于一小撮阶级敌人挑动两派群众长期打“内战”，学院的斗、批、改基本上没有进行，轻视劳动、轻视工农的资产阶级思想，没有受到有力的批判，就连扫地、打扫卫生这样的事，师生们都不动手，仍然专门由工人去做。工人毛泽东思想宣传队决定用自己的行动，对师生们进行再教育。他们在学校生活中，一切自己动手，房子脏了主动扫，厕所自己掏，还到伙房、车场、病房跟班劳动，见活就带头干。师生们看到工人和解放军指战员的这些实际行动，受到很大教育，有的说：“我们是学医的，自己不讲卫生，还要工人、解放军替我们打扫，真是可耻。”有的学生贴出大字报检查自己“衣来伸手，饭来张口”的少爷、小姐作风，表示要向工人阶级学习，积极参加体力劳动，彻底改变鄙视劳动、轻视工农群众的资产阶级思想。有的毕业班学生，开始对分配到农村不够满意，对比工人阶级的崇高品质，十分惭愧地说：“如果再不愿去农村，真对不起工人、贫下中农对我们的培养。”
    现在，一个群众性的斗、批、改高潮已经在中山医学院里掀起。整个学院出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。革命师生员工赞扬说：我们长期纠缠不休、不能解决的矛盾，工人毛泽东思想宣传队一来就很快解决了。他们说：实践证明，无产阶级教育革命单靠我们这些知识分子是不行的，必须要有工人阶级的坚强领导。我们一定好好接受工农兵群众用毛泽东思想对我们进行的再教育，彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
