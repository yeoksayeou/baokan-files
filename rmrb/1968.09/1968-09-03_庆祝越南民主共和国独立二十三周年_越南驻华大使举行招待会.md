For the celebration of the 23rd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Wu Mingluan, held a reception today in Beijing.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Kang Sheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Huang Yongsheng, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Deputy Minister of Defense Su Yu, representatives of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the capital workers, were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Wu Mingluan and Premier Zhou Enlai both spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Ambassador Wu Mingluan talked about the significance of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the struggle of the Vietnamese people over the past 23 years to defend and consolidate the independence, freedom, and unity of their country.

The ambassador strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for waging the most brutal and destructive war in human history against Vietnam, pointing out that the military and people of both the North and South have achieved brilliant victories in the war of resistance against the Americans to save the country. He said that at present, the unity of the people of North and South Vietnam is closer than ever before, and their resolve to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country is stronger than ever. The people and military of the North are providing the most thorough and timely support to the revolution in the South, fulfilling their glorious duty to the rear for the front.

The ambassador said that the Vietnamese people are resolutely overcoming all difficulties and uniting to respond to Chairman Hu's call: "To defend the independence of the country, to fulfill our duty to the peoples of all nations fighting against U.S. imperialism, our entire nation and army will unite, endure hardships and sacrifices, and fight to the end for a complete victory."

Ambassador Wu Mingluan said that in the course of their revolutionary struggle, the Vietnamese people have always received precious support and assistance from the fraternal Chinese people. Chairman Mao said: "The fraternal people of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." On behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the people, I express our heartfelt and profound gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, led by the respected Chairman Mao.

The ambassador said that over the past two years, the Chinese people have been vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The achievements of the fraternal Chinese people are a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people fully support the efforts of the Chinese people in advancing the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Premier Zhou Enlai, in his speech, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended the warmest congratulations to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the heroic Vietnamese people.

He said that at present, the situation in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the Americans to save the country is excellent. However, the U.S. imperialists, in close collaboration with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, will definitely make desperate struggles. Although the Vietnamese people will encounter various difficulties and twists and turns on their forward march, we are convinced that under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, as long as they persist in a protracted war and oppose capitulation and compromise, they will certainly smash all the plots and tricks of the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory in the war of resistance against the Americans. The Chinese government and people will, as always, resolutely support you to the end.

In discussing the Soviet modern revisionist traitor clique's occupation of Czechoslovakia and the subsequent abduction of the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership to Moscow to issue a so-called "Sino-Czechoslovakian Joint Communiqué," Premier Zhou Enlai said, "The Sino-Czechoslovakian Joint Communiqué" is a dirty deal made at the point of a bayonet.

The Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership signed a "capitulation agreement" with the Soviet revisionists, acting as the Soviet revisionists' Quisling. They are traitors to the Czechoslovakian nation.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that this so-called "Sino-Czechoslovakian Joint Communiqué" is the result of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists' attempt to re-divide the world, both competing and colluding over the Czechoslovakian issue. In sacrificing the interests of the Czechoslovakian people, the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the Czechoslovakian revisionists are completely in agreement.

He said that the Czechoslovakian incident is by no means an isolated incident. The Soviet revisionists will definitely continue to betray the Arab people and will definitely continue to betray the Vietnamese people. This is certain and beyond doubt. Those who have harbored illusions about the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists should wake up now.

He said that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The peoples of all countries, more than ninety percent of the total population, are always revolutionary and will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will always oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and will always oppose revisionism."

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people resolutely support the people of Czechoslovakia, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the Arab countries, and all revolutionary peoples of the world in their struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their running dogs. We firmly believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of all countries will one day bury U.S.-led imperialism and Soviet revisionism-centered modern revisionism.

Those attending the reception today also included relevant officials from the Chinese government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant parties, including Wang Xinting, Zhang Xianyi, Zhao Qimin, Cao Lihuai, Zhang Yixiang, Luo Guibo, Ma Wenbo, Zeng Shan, Li Qiang, Liu Dayu, Ding Guoyi, Ding Xilin, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, as well as representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the garrison troops in Beijing.

The representative of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Van Quang, and representatives of various countries' diplomatic missions in China were also invited to attend the reception.

To celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, Du Wenmin, the Consul General in Kunming, Yang Wenzhong, and the Consul in Nanning, Ly Quang Dat, held receptions on September 1 and 2, respectively.

    吴明鸾大使和周总理先后在招待会上讲话
    新华社二日讯　为庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年，越南驻中国大使吴明鸾，今天在北京举行招待会。
    国务院总理周恩来，人大常委会副委员长康生，中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，国务院副总理陈毅、李先念，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，国防部副部长粟裕，首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    吴明鸾大使和周恩来总理先后在招待会上讲话。
    吴明鸾大使在讲话中谈到了越南民主共和国宣布独立的意义，以及二十三年来越南人民为捍卫和巩固祖国的独立、自由和统一而进行的斗争。
    大使强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南进行了一场人类历史上最残暴的毁灭性战争，指出越南南北方军民在抗美救国战争中已取得了辉煌的胜利。他说，目前，越南南北两方人民的团结比以往任何时候都更紧密，解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的意志比以往任何时候都更强烈。我国北方军民大力给南方革命以最充分最及时的支援，胜利履行大后方对大前线的光荣义务。
    大使说，越南人民坚决克服一切困难，同仇敌忾，来响应胡主席的号召：“为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    吴明鸾大使说，越南人民在革命斗争过程中，一向得到兄弟的中国人民的宝贵的支持和援助。毛主席说：“兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”我代表越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和人民，向以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，表示衷心的和深深的感谢。
    大使说，两年来，中国人民高举毛泽东思想红旗，广泛进行热火朝天的无产阶级文化大革命。兄弟的中国人民所取得的成就，对越南人民的革命斗争是一个巨大的鼓舞。越南人民全力支持中国人民在为推动社会主义革命、社会主义建设事业和无产阶级文化大革命所作的一切努力。
    周恩来总理在讲话中，代表中国政府和中国人民，向越南民主共和国政府和英雄的越南人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    他说，目前，越南人民抗美救国战争的形势大好。但是，美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团的密切配合下，一定还要作疯狂的挣扎。尽管越南人民在前进的道路上，还会遇到各种困难和曲折，我们坚信，越南人民在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，只要坚持持久战争，反对投降妥协，就一定能够粉碎美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，坚决支援你们打到底。
    周恩来总理在谈到苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团在出兵占领了捷克斯洛伐克以后，又劫持捷修领导集团去莫斯科，抛出了一个所谓“苏捷会谈公报”时说，“苏捷会谈公报”是在刺刀下达成的一笔肮脏交易。
    捷修领导集团同苏修签订了“城下之盟”，充当苏修的吉斯林。他们是捷克斯洛伐克民族的叛徒。
    周恩来总理说，这个所谓“苏捷会谈公报”是美苏妄图重新瓜分世界、在捷克斯洛伐克问题上又争夺又勾结的结果。在牺牲捷克斯洛伐克人民利益这一点上，美帝、苏修、捷修完全是一致的。
    他说，捷克斯洛伐克事件决不是一个孤立的事件。苏修一定要继续出卖阿拉伯人民，一定要继续出卖越南人民，这是肯定的、毫无疑义的。一切对于苏修、美帝抱有幻想的人，现在是猛醒的时候了。
    他说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”
    周恩来总理说，中国人民坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民、东欧人民、苏联人民、阿拉伯人民以及全世界一切革命人民起来进行斗争，推翻美帝、苏修及其走狗的反动统治。我们坚决相信，在马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，各国人民总有一天会把以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修为中心的现代修正主义彻底埋葬。
    出席今天招待会的，还有我国政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会等有关方面的负责人王新亭、张贤约、赵启民、曹里怀、张翼翔、罗贵波、马文波、曾山、李强、刘大煜、丁国钰、丁西林，北京市各革命群众组织负责成员，驻京部队五好战士代表。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，各国驻中国使节也应邀出席了招待会。
    为庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十三周年，越南民主共和国驻广州总领事杜文敏、驻昆明总领事杨文忠、驻南宁总领事馆领事黎光奠，在一日和二日分别举行了招待会。
