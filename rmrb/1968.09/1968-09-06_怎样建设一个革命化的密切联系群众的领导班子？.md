The members of the Party Committee of a certain artillery regiment in the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, an advanced collective in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "to be the teacher of the people, first be the student of the people." In the great storms of class struggle, they learn from the masses, strive to change their worldviews, and continuously raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. This has effectively promoted the ideological revolutionization of the leadership team.

A Few Years Ago

A few years ago, under the great call of Comrade Lin Biao to raise the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, the Party Committee of a certain artillery regiment in the Beijing Military Region launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. In the process of study, they often encountered a problem: how to correctly handle the relationship between leaders and the masses, and between changing the objective world and changing the subjective world? Initially, some comrades thought that by immersing themselves in the masses' struggles, they would have a good environment, like sailing with the current, advancing without retreating, and not needing to make efforts to advance. However, facts gave them a profound lesson.

Once, Party Committee member Wang Yuzhou went to the Third Company to guide work and found that the company had many weak links. The reason? Some soldiers reflected that the main issue was with the cadres. Therefore, he strictly criticized the cadres but did not engage in self-criticism. As a result, this visit to the company did not only fail to guide effectively but also caused a lot of complaints, making the company's cadres carry a burden of thoughts.

He reflected on this issue and revisited Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. Chairman Mao said: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent signs that distinguish us from other parties. We have said that houses should be cleaned regularly, otherwise they will accumulate dust; faces should be washed regularly, otherwise they will be covered in dust." Comrade Lin Biao said: "Revolution also requires self-revolution. Without self-revolution, this revolution will not be successful." Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions made him realize that the reason for the failure of this visit to the company was his lack of self-revolutionary spirit, not putting himself "into the picture," and not daring to make serious self-criticisms.

He followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went to the company again. This time, he first conducted in-depth investigations and solicited the masses' opinions, then made sincere self-criticisms at the branch meeting, and fought against the "self" in his mind. He also studied Chairman Mao's works with the cadres, discussed the sweetness of emphasizing proletarian politics, and jointly studied measures to improve work. His spirit of leading by example in fighting against the "self" and seriously engaging in self-revolution moved the cadres to tears. Under his help, the company finally found the root of the problem, and work began to improve.

Why did two visits to the company yield two different results? This comrade's practice educated everyone. Everyone realized that after leaders go to the masses and reach the front line, if they only change others without first changing themselves, they cannot lead the masses. Only by acknowledging from the depths of their souls that "the masses are the true heroes" and always placing themselves in the position to be changed, humbly learning from the revolutionary masses' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's thoughts, feelings, and stance, and continuously revolutionizing the "self" in their minds, can they truly lead the masses forward.

The regimental Party Committee, based on everyone's personal experiences, timely held study sessions and sharing meetings, summarized experiences and lessons, and clearly summarized the "three firsts" that must be adhered to when going to the masses. These are: when changing the subjective world and the objective world, first change the subjective world; when changing thoughts and guiding work, first change thoughts; when educating oneself and educating the masses, first educate oneself. After raising their awareness, they all carried revolutionary books and backpacks, immersed themselves in the front line, and studied, fought, labored, and lived with the broad masses of soldiers. Knocking off the "official" air and willingly being a student of the masses

After going to the masses, should one appear in the guise of an ordinary soldier or a leader? How do leading cadres go to the masses and knock off the "official" air to promote ideological revolutionization?

Once, during a discussion on this issue, a regimental Party Committee member thought that leading cadres are the ones who set the direction and grasp principles. Even when they go to the companies, they should focus on "big matters," and "small matters" can be done or not done.

Soon, this Party Committee member went to a company. Because he could not put down his airs and did not truly blend in with the masses, there was always some distance in his thoughts and feelings with the masses. Although he lived with the soldiers for a period, in the soldiers' minds, he only had the position of a "leader," not the feelings of a comrade. When he talked to the soldiers, his heart did not connect with theirs, and when he sought the soldiers' criticisms and suggestions, he only heard "praise."

Why didn't the soldiers want to give him criticisms? Was it because he had no shortcomings?

This Party Committee member, with this question, studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "People's work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how high one's position is, among the people, one should appear in the guise of an ordinary laborer. One must not be allowed to put on airs." "The more you put on airs in front of the people, the more you act like a 'hero,' the more you have to sell this, the less the people will buy it." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, his heart became clear: originally, the soldiers did not want to give him criticisms because he did not put down his airs, put himself in the wrong position, and lacked a correct attitude!

From then on, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, put down his airs, fought against the "official" air, and appeared everywhere in the guise of an ordinary soldier. When studying Chairman Mao's works, he shared with the soldiers, took the lead in exposing and fighting against the "self"; usually, he chatted with the soldiers about their family histories and daily lives, becoming very close; when laboring, he led by example, fearing no hardships or fatigue; when resting, he swept the floor and washed dishes with the soldiers. If a soldier's clothes were torn, he secretly mended them; in the middle of the night, if the weather changed, he got up to cover everyone with blankets...

Because his attitude changed, the masses' attitude towards him also changed. He and the cadres and soldiers had a common language, and their feelings gradually built up. Everyone not only saw him as a teacher but also as a close comrade. Everyone affectionately called him "Old Eighth Route Army" and "Old Soldier." More people actively sought him out for talks, sometimes he even had to "make an appointment"; more people gave him criticisms and suggestions, and they could speak frankly without holding back. From then on, he not only accurately grasped the masses' thoughts and did ideological work to the point, but more importantly, the masses and he were heart to heart. He received the masses' help and supervision, and his steps towards ideological revolutionization became faster and faster.

This Party Committee member's experience gave the Party Committee members a profound enlightenment. This is that after leading cadres go to the masses, if they stand above the masses and act as teachers, they will inevitably become detached from the masses. Even if they have good intentions for self-revolution, they will not achieve the goal. Only by placing themselves in the position of an ordinary soldier, willingly being a student of the masses, and thoroughly knocking off the "official" air, can they be heart to heart with the masses and promote their own ideological revolutionization.

Proactively Going to the Masses to "Wash Face" and "Take a Bath"

After leading cadres go to the masses in the guise of an ordinary soldier, is ideological revolutionization guaranteed? The practice of this regimental Party Committee shows that leading cadres consciously putting down their airs and willingly being students of the masses is only the first step in achieving ideological revolutionization. For the "self" in the mind, one must adopt an offensive attitude to continuously achieve new results in ideological revolutionization.

The story of Party Committee member and regimental commander Wang Jinhan's "three visits to the command company" is a vivid example.

The command company was a relatively weak company. In 1964, it was rated as a "Four Good" unit once, but it never came close to being rated as "Four Good" again. The cadres and soldiers had complaints about the regimental leadership, thinking that they did not care about or help the company enough. Wang Jinhan's first visit to the company also wanted to hear everyone's opinions and solve the company's problems, but he was afraid that the masses' criticisms would be "too harsh," so he did not dare to make self-criticisms. As a result, the masses did not speak their minds, and the problems were not solved.

What was the reason?

He compared with Chairman Mao's teachings, used high standards to examine himself, and found that his attitude was not high, lacking a thorough self-revolutionary spirit. He did not dare to revolutionize himself, so how could he lead others to revolutionize?! Therefore, he decided to go to the masses to "take off his pants" and "cut off his tail," and fight against the "self" in his mind.

The second time, he brought the staff to the company. He followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "making more self-criticisms," first stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait at the company's general meeting, and painfully examined himself for not caring about the company's construction and committing the error of detaching from the masses. At the same time, he bravely exposed his active thoughts, fought against the wrong thoughts of "being afraid to expose the self for being ugly" and "being afraid to fight the self for being painful," and sincerely welcomed everyone's criticisms. The regimental commander's high-attitude self-revolutionary spirit deeply moved the entire company's soldiers. Wang Jinhan's second visit to the company not only washed away the "official" air in his soul, knocked off the "self," but also pushed the entire company to launch a mass movement of fighting against the "self" and criticizing revisionism. The entire company's spiritual face was renewed.

Wang Jinhan tasted the sweetness of high-attitude fighting against the "self" and criticizing revisionism, and his enthusiasm for the third visit to the company was even higher. He "squatted" in the company and fought against the "self" with the soldiers. He not only took the lead in exposing and fighting against the "self" but also dared to correct himself, placing himself under the masses' supervision. Later, he was honored to attend the Beijing Military Region's conference of active members in studying Chairman Mao's works. He wrote down these experiences: "Leading cadres must follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life, forever preserving revolutionary youth. One must see oneself in two aspects. For one's shortcomings and errors, one must not passively defend but have the courage and confidence to proactively go to the masses to 'wash face' and 'take a bath,' truly touching the soul, and achieving ideological revolutionization."

How to fight against the "self"? The regimental Party Committee's experience is:

First, one must develop a highly conscious revolutionary spirit. They believe that because leading cadres are in different positions and the masses respect the leadership, it is generally not easy to hear opinions from below. In this situation, one must proactively go to the masses to expose and fight against the "self," create pressure for oneself. The more opinions the masses have about oneself, the more one must go to the masses to listen to opinions, to be clear-eyed and quick-witted, and correct errors in time. One must not hide illnesses and avoid medicine, passively waiting.

Second, one must develop a thorough revolutionary spirit, relentlessly pursuing and attacking. Truly touching the soul, exposing the "self" must be thorough, fighting against the "self" must be principled, and correcting must be seen in actions.

Third, one must develop a revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, being consistent in words and deeds, fighting and correcting while changing, and persevering.

In recent years, they have made relatively outstanding achievements in the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs" work and army building, but they are not satisfied with this. They proactively go to the masses who have opinions about them to listen to criticisms. Even if the masses' criticisms are too harsh and the language is too strong, they can take it as "bitter medicine" to urge themselves forward.

Breaking the "Self" and Establishing the "Public" Must Fully Mobilize the Masses

In practice, the regimental Party Committee deeply felt that to achieve ideological revolutionization, one must fully mobilize the masses and open fire on the "self" in one's mind. Only in this way can one launch a "surrounding and annihilating" battle against the various bourgeois thoughts hidden in one's mind, continuously climb the peak of ideological revolutionization.

Regimental political commissar Zhao Jiang usually consciously exposes and fights against the "self," and has relatively strict requirements for himself. In the past, he thought that in the process of promoting his own ideological revolutionization, having this consciousness and initiative was enough. But in a Party congress, unexpectedly, many comrades gave him more than thirty criticisms at once, making his face hot and deeply touching his soul. This fact made him deeply realize that leading cadres' ideological revolutionization cannot be satisfied with just generally strict requirements for oneself but must mobilize the masses to help oneself launch a "surrounding and annihilating" battle against the "self." Only in this way can one deeply expose, fiercely fight against, deeply dig out, and quickly correct the "self" in one's mind, accelerating the process of ideological revolutionization.

How did they mobilize the masses to launch an attack on the "self"? They used every annual Party congress, rectifying the work of the organs and the comprehensive evaluation of the "Four Goods" as an opportunity to fully mobilize the masses, face to face and back to back, launching fierce attacks on the Party Committee and the leaders' shortcomings and errors. There were written and oral criticisms, using various methods to let everyone speak their minds, deeply exposing and criticizing the Party Committee members' shortcomings and errors in their thoughts. Then they collected the masses' opinions, brought the problems to Chairman Mao's works to find answers, used the form of the Party Committee's heart-to-heart meeting to further dig out the roots, seriously discuss the harm, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and formulate rectification measures. They deeply felt that every year, a few fierce democratic movements made them sweat a few times, take a few hot baths, washing away the dirt accumulated in their minds, indeed feeling clear-headed and comfortable all over. In this way, problems would not pile up, and there would be no knots between superiors and subordinates.

They also realized in the practice of the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs" that every time in the fierce class struggle, when domestic and international situations undergo major changes, when implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, it is also the time when everyone's thoughts change the most, and the struggle between the public and the self is the fiercest. At these critical moments, only by fully mobilizing the masses and opening fire on the "self," fiercely breaking the "self" and establishing the public, can one ensure that everyone has a clear mind, see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand the storms of class struggle. Since participating in the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs," they have seized four critical moments to launch four major attacks on the "self." When accepting the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs" tasks, they mobilized the masses to fiercely fight against the "fear"; when deeply entering the grassroots, they mobilized the masses to fiercely fight against the "official" air; when achieving some results, they mobilized the masses to fiercely fight against the "arrogance"; when the regions where they undertook the task of supporting the left generally established revolutionary committees, they mobilized the masses to fiercely fight against the "relaxation." They felt that at critical moments, the more fiercely one fights against the "self," the more closely one can follow the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

They also paid great attention to the active thoughts of the Party Committee members. Once they found that a Party Committee member had the "self," they consciously mobilized the masses to help him correct it, making the "self" once exposed, immediately overcome. Once, some standing committee members discussed the shortcomings of a sister unit in supporting the left work in casual conversations. The Party Committee found that this member's discussion reflected an attitude problem towards the sister unit, a manifestation of arrogant sentiments. Therefore, they seized this active thought, mobilized the supporting left personnel and the staff, and fiercely fought against the "arrogance." This fire made the Party Committee members' minds clear. They always kept Chairman Mao's teachings of "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind" and "do not eat old capital, create new achievements" as their motto, doing: achieving a little success, finding a problem; receiving a little praise, finding a gap, continuously seeing oneself in two aspects. In a chorus of praise, they always maintained a humble and cautious style.

Breaking the "Self" and Establishing the Public Must Grasp the Big Nodes

In the struggle, the regimental Party Committee deeply felt that to go to the masses and promote ideological revolutionization, one must grasp the big nodes, that is, "break the self at the crucial point, establish the public at the root," fundamentally raising the awareness of executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In 1960, Comrade Lin Biao issued the great call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought." The Party Committee began to persistently study Chairman Mao's works, and the leadership work and the army's spiritual face underwent great changes. But at that time, the main focus was on guiding work, not placing the transformation of the worldview in the first position. In 1963, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "learn from Comrade Lei Feng." They entered a new stage of studying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing hard work in the "use" aspect, and seriously transforming the worldview. However, at that time, they had not yet grasped breaking the big self and establishing the big public as the fundamental aspect of ideological revolutionization, so the awareness of the struggle between the two lines was still not high. Some Party Committee members, who had experienced hardships since childhood, joined the army, fought battles, shed blood, and after liberation, often carried out reminiscence and comparison activities, thinking that they had grown up following Chairman Mao, were loyal to Chairman Mao, and would not have problems in their later lives.

However, facts educated them.

In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Rongcheng used counter-revolutionary two-faced methods to crazily promote the bourgeois military line, stirring up the "big competition" evil wind. Some Party Committee members lacked sufficient vigilance and initially resisted it weakly.

A series of problems were placed in front of everyone:

Why did we want to defend Chairman Mao, but when the counter-revolutionary revisionist conspired against Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, we could not quickly expose it?

Why did we want to follow Chairman Mao, but at critical moments, we almost changed direction?

The reality of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines made them deeply realize that big nodes govern a lifetime, and small nodes govern a moment. A leading cadre, in the process of ideological revolutionization, if only grasps small nodes and neglects big nodes, lacks a high awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, in the complex class struggle, cannot distinguish right from wrong, distinguish enemies from friends, will be deceived by class enemies who wave red flags to oppose red flags, and may even lead the army astray.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made them raise their understanding of this issue to a higher level. The Party Committee clearly proposed: unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the only big nodes of revolutionary soldiers. The ideological revolutionization of the Party Committee, in all its changes, must be changed in the "three loyalties." Without this, ideological revolutionization would have no soul, and the construction of the Party Committee would lose its direction.

In recent years, they have always taken unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao as the fundamental aspect of the revolutionary construction of the Party Committee, vigorously cultivating profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, making the Party Committee members' awareness of class struggle stronger and stronger, the awareness of the struggle between the two lines higher and higher, and the fighting spirit to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line more and more vigorous. Since undertaking the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs" work, the members of this regimental Party Committee have led the supporting left personnel to actively participate in the front line of struggle, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and have fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses day and night, bravely executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, jointly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, making their red hearts for loyalty to Chairman Mao burn brighter and brighter. Regimental Party Committee secretary Xiao Jianping, with a firm determination to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, at the most difficult moment of the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle in the stationed area, dispatched the supporting left troops to clearly support the proletarian revolutionary masses, and was praised by the Party Committee members as a "good commander." Regimental political commissar Zhao Jiang, since taking charge of the "Three Supports, Two Military Affairs" work, has deeply entered the front line. Where the struggle situation is the most complex, there are his footsteps. In more than a year, he has traveled through five supporting left areas, contacted tens of thousands of revolutionary masses, held dozens of symposiums, listened to the masses' opinions, and fought with the revolutionary masses and supporting left personnel. He was praised as a "good example of learning."

Recently, this regimental Party Committee was honored to attend the conference of active members in studying Chairman Mao's works of the Beijing Military Region's artillery. The Party Committee members were once again fortunate to see the great leader Chairman Mao. They decided to remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "do not eat old capital, create new achievements," be more humble and cautious, avoid arrogance and impatience, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, unify thoughts, steps, and actions, firmly and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further promote ideological revolutionization, and continue to advance along the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

    怎样建设一个革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子？
    ——北京部队炮兵某师党委成员搞好思想革命化的经验
    人民解放军北京部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体炮兵某师党委成员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“要做人民的先生，先做人民的学生”的伟大教导，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，向群众学习，努力改造世界观，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地促进了领导班子的思想革命化。要教育群众，先教育自己
    几年前，在林彪副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段的伟大号召下，北京部队炮兵某师党委掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的高潮。在学习的过程中，他们经常遇到这样一个问题：怎样正确处理领导和群众、改造客观世界和改造主观世界的关系？起初，有的同志认为，深入到群众斗争之中，有了良好的环境，就象顺水行舟，只进不退，不需要自己努力，也会前进。可是，事实给了他们深刻的教育。
    有一次，党委常委王玉舟同志到三连去指导工作，发现这个连队有不少薄弱环节。原因在哪里？有些战士反映，主要在干部身上。于是，他便严格地批评了干部，自己却没作自我批评。结果，这次深入连队，不但没有起到指导作用，反而引起了一堆意见，使连队干部背上了思想包袱。
    他带着这个问题重温了毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示。毛主席说：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。我们曾经说过，房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。”林副主席说：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，使他认识到，这次下连指导工作所以会失败，原因就在于自己缺乏自我革命精神，没把自己“摆进去”，勇于作认真的自我批评。
    他按照毛主席的教导，第二次深入连队。这回，他首先进行深入的调查研究，征求群众的意见，然后，在支委会上作了诚恳的自我批评，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字。他又和干部们一起学习毛主席著作，一起畅谈突出无产阶级政治的甜头，共同研究改进工作的措施。他带头斗私，认真进行自我革命的精神，使干部们感动得流下热泪。在他的帮助下，连队终于找到了问题的所在，从此，工作有了新的起色。
    为什么两次下连两种结果？这位常委的实践教育了大家。大家认识到，领导干部深入群众，到了第一线以后，如果只去改造别人，不先改造自己，就不能领导群众，只有从灵魂深处承认“群众是真正的英雄”，时刻把自己摆在被改造的位置，虚心学习革命群众无限忠于毛主席的思想、感情和立场，不断地革自己头脑中“私”字的命，才能真正带领群众前进。
    师党委根据各人的切身体会，及时召开学习会、讲用会，总结了经验教训，明确归纳了深入群众必须坚持“三个首先”。这就是：改造主观世界和改造客观世界，首先要改造主观世界；改造思想和指导工作，首先要改造思想；教育自己和教育群众，首先要教育自己。认识提高后，他们纷纷带上革命宝书，背起背包，投身到第一线，和广大战士学习、战斗、劳动、生活在一起。打掉“官”气，甘当群众小学生
    到群众中去以后，是以普通一兵的姿态出现，还是以首长的姿态出现？领导干部深入群众，如何打掉“官”气，搞好思想革命化？
    一次，在讨论这个问题时，一位师党委委员认为，领导干部是定方向的，抓原则的，即使深入连队，也应抓“大事”，“小事”可做可不做。
    不久，这位党委委员来到连队，由于他放不下架子，没有真正和群众打成一片，因此，和群众的思想感情总有一些距离。虽然他和战士一起生活了一段时间，但他在战士的心目中，只有“首长”的位置，没有战友的感情。他找战士谈心，心贴不到一起，他去征求战士的批评意见时，听到的只是“表扬”。
    为什么战士不愿给自己提意见？是自己没有缺点吗？
    这位党委委员，带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子。”“在群众面前把你的资格摆得越老，越象个‘英雄’，越要出卖这一套，群众就越不买你的帐。”对照毛主席的教导，他心头豁亮了：原来战士不愿向自己提意见，是因为自己没有放下架子，摆错了位置，缺少一个正确的态度啊！
    从此，他按照毛主席的教导，放下架子，狠斗“官”气，处处以普通一兵的姿态出现。学习毛主席著作时，他和战士一起讲用，带头亮私、斗私；平时，他和战士一起忆家史，谈家常，亲密无间；劳动时，他以身作则，不怕艰苦劳累；休息时，他又和战士一道扫地、洗碗筷。有的战士衣服破了，他悄悄给他补上；半夜里气候变了，他起床给大家盖被子……。
    由于他态度变了，群众对他的态度也发生了变化。他和干部战士有了共同的语言，感情逐渐建立起来。大家不但把他当作老师，而且把他当作知心战友。大家亲切地称他“老八路”、“老战士”。主动找他谈话的人多了，有时还得“挂号”；向他提批评建议的人也越来越多，并能做到直言不讳，不留情面。从此，他不但能及时准确地掌握群众的思想情况，把思想工作做到点子上，更重要的是群众和他心连心了。他得到了群众的帮助和监督，他的思想革命化的步伐越迈越快。
    这位党委委员的经历，给党委全体成员以极深刻的启示。这就是领导干部深入群众之后，如果高踞于群众之上，以先生自居，就必然会脱离群众，即使他有自我改造的良好愿望，也达不到目的。只有置身于普通一兵的位置，甘当群众的小学生，彻底打掉“官”气，才能和群众心贴心，才能促进自己思想革命化。
    主动到群众中去“洗脸”“洗澡”
    领导干部以普通一兵的姿态深入群众，思想革命化是否就完全有保证了？这个师党委的实践说明，领导干部自觉地放下架子，甘当群众的小学生，这只是实现思想革命化的第一步。对头脑中的“私”字，还必须采取主动进攻的态度，才能不断取得思想革命化的新成果。
    党委委员、团长王锦汉同志“三下指挥连”的故事，就是一个生动的例证。
    指挥连是个较差的连队，一九六四年评上一次四好以后，再也没沾四好的边。干部战士对团领导都有意见，认为他们对连队关心帮助不够。王锦汉第一次下连，又想听听大家的意见，解决连队的问题，又怕群众批评“过火”，因此，不敢主动作自我批评，结果群众没有把心里话讲出来，问题没有得到解决。
    原因在那里呢？
    他对照毛主席的教导，用高标准检查自己，发现自己的姿态不高，缺乏彻底的自我革命精神。自己都不敢革命，怎么能领导别人革命？！于是，他决心到群众中“脱裤子”“割尾巴”，狠斗头脑中的“私”字。
    第二次，他带着机关干部下到连里。他遵照毛主席关于“多作自我批评”的教导，首先在全连大会上，站在毛主席像前，沉痛地检查自己对连队建设不关心，犯了脱离群众的错误。同时大胆地暴露自己的活思想，狠批了“亮私怕丑”“斗私怕痛”的错误思想，恳切地欢迎大家批评。团长高姿态自我革命的精神，使全连指战员深受感动。王锦汉同志这次下连，不仅冲刷了灵魂深处的“官”气，打掉了“私”字，而且推动全连掀起了一个群众性的斗私批修的高潮，全连精神面貌焕然一新。
    王锦汉尝到了高姿态斗私批修的甜头，第三次下连队的积极性更高了。他“蹲”在连里，和战士一起斗私批修。他不但主动亮私斗私，而且勇于改正，把自己置于群众的监督之下。后来，他光荣地出席了北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。他写下这样一段体会：“领导干部要紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命，永葆革命青春，就必须一分为二地看待自己。对自己的缺点错误，不能消极防御，要有勇气、有信心，主动到群众中去‘洗脸’、‘洗澡’，才能真正触及灵魂，实现思想革命化。”
    怎样对“私”字打进攻战？这个师党委的体会是：
    一、要发扬高度自觉的革命精神。他们认为，领导干部由于所处地位不同，加之群众又很尊重领导，一般不容易听到下边的意见。在这种情况下，就更应当主动地到群众中亮私斗私，引火烧身，给自己制造压力。群众对自己的意见越多，越要到群众中去听取意见，才能耳聪目明，及时改正错误。决不能讳疾忌医，消极等待。
    二、要发扬彻底革命、穷追猛打的精神。真正做到狠触灵魂，亮私要彻底，斗私要上纲，改正要见行动。
    三、要发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，做到言行一致，边斗边改，持之以恒。
    几年来，他们在“三支”“两军”工作和部队建设中，做出了比较显著的成绩，但他们不以此为满足。他们主动到对自己有意见的群众中听取批评。即使群众有些批评过火，言词过激，也能把它当作“苦口良药”，鞭策自己前进。
    破私立公必须充分发动群众
    这个师党委在实践中深刻体会到：要实现思想革命化，必须充分发动群众，向自己头脑中的“私”字开火。只有这样，才能对埋在自己头脑中形形色色的资产阶级思想打“围歼战”，不断攀登思想革命化的高峰。
    师政委赵江同志，平时能够自觉地亮私斗私，对自己要求比较严格。过去，他以为，在促进自己思想革命化的过程中，有了这种自觉性、主动性，就满可以了。但在一次党代会上，不料有不少同志向他一下子提了三十多条意见，使得他脸上火辣辣的，狠狠地触动了他的灵魂。这个事实，使他深刻认识到，领导干部的思想革命化，不能满足于只是一般地自己对自己的严格要求，还必须发动群众帮助自己打破私立公的“围歼战”。这样才能对自己头脑中的“私”字揭得透，斗得狠，挖得深，改得快，才能加速思想革命化的进程。
    他们是怎样发动群众向“私”字发动进攻的呢？
    一、他们利用每年一度的党代会，整顿机关工作和四好总评的时机，充分发动群众，面对面、背靠背地向着党委和领导成员的缺点错误猛烈开火。既有书面的，也有口头的，运用各种方式，让大家把话说完，深刻揭露和批评党委成员思想上的缺点错误。然后把群众的意见集中起来，带着问题到毛主席著作中找答案，采取党委交心会的形式进一步深挖根源，大论危害，开展批评与自我批评，订出整改措施。他们深深体会到：每年来几次火力很猛的民主运动，使自己出几身大汗，洗几次热水澡，把自己思想上积下来的污垢冲刷干净，确实感到头脑清醒，浑身舒畅，这样还可以使问题不致成堆，上下不结疙瘩。
    二、他们在“三支”“两军”的实践中认识到：每当在阶级斗争激烈的时刻，在国内外形势发生重大变化的时刻，在贯彻伟大领袖毛主席伟大战略部署的时刻，也是每个人思想变化最大，公和私的斗争最激烈的时刻。在这些关键时刻，只有充分发动群众，向“私”字开火，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，才能保证每个成员有清醒的头脑，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，看得清，站得稳，顶得住。参加“三支”“两军”以来，他们就抓住了四个关键时刻，向“私”字发动了四次总攻击。在接受“三支”“两军”任务时，他们发动群众，狠斗了“怕”字；在深入基层时，发动群众，狠斗了“官”气；在工作取得了一定成绩时，发动群众，狠斗了“骄”气；在担负支左任务的地区普遍建立了革命委员会时，发动群众，狠斗了“松”字。他们体会到，在关键的时刻对“私”字斗得越狠，对伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署就会跟得越紧。
    三、这个党委很注意抓党委成员的活思想。一旦发现了党委成员有“私”字，就自觉发动群众，帮助他纠正，使“私”字一露头，就得到克服。一次，有的常委在闲谈中议论兄弟部队在支左工作中的缺点，党委发现后，认为这个委员的议论，反映了对兄弟部队的态度问题，是骄傲情绪的流露。因此，就抓住这个活思想，发动支左人员，机关干部，狠烧“骄”气。这把火，使党委成员的头脑清醒起来。他们时刻将毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”和“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，作为自己的座右铭，做到：有了一点成绩，就找一次问题；受到一次表扬，就找一次差距，不断地对自己一分为二。在一片赞扬声中，始终保持了谦虚、谨慎的作风。
    破私立公必须抓大节
    这个师党委在斗争中深深体会到，到群众中搞好思想革命化，必须抓大节，就是要“破私破在要害处，立公立在根本上”，从根本上提高执行和捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的觉悟。
    一九六○年，林副主席发出“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的伟大号召，党委便开始坚持学习毛主席著作，领导工作和部队的精神面貌发生了很大变化。但当时主要是为了指导工作，没有把改造世界观放在首位。一九六三年，伟大领袖毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召。他们学习毛主席著作进入新阶段，强调了在“用”字上狠下功夫，认真改造世界观。但是，当时还没有把破大私，立大公，当作思想革命化的根本来抓，因而两条路线斗争觉悟仍然不高。有的党委委员从小逃荒要饭，参军后打过仗，流过血，解放后又经常开展忆比活动，满以为自己是紧跟毛主席长大的，是忠于毛主席的，后半辈子出不了问题了。
    但是，事实教育了他们。
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿采用反革命两面手法，疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线，刮起“大比武”妖风，有些党委委员缺乏足够的警惕，一度抵制不力。
    一连串的问题摆在每个人面前：
    为什么我们一心想保卫毛主席，而当反革命修正主义分子阴谋反对毛主席无产阶级建军路线时，自己却不能迅速地识破？
    为什么我们一心想跟毛主席走，而在关键时刻却险些转了向？
    阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的现实，使他们深刻地认识到，大节管一世，小节管一时。一个领导干部，在思想革命化过程中，如果只抓小节，忽视大节，就没有高度的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，在复杂的阶级斗争中，就不能辨明是非，分清敌我，就会被打着红旗反红旗的阶级敌人所蒙蔽，甚至把部队引上邪路。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动使他们对这个问题的认识，上升到更高的水平。党委明确地提出：无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是革命战士唯一的大节。党委思想革命化，千化万化就要化在“三忠于”上，离开了这个，思想革命化就没有灵魂，党委建设就失去了方向。
    几年来，他们始终把无限忠于毛主席，作为党委革命化建设的根本，大力培养对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，使党委委员阶级斗争观念越来越强，路线斗争觉悟越来越高，捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的斗志越来越旺盛。担负“三支”“两军”工作以来，这个师党委成员带领支左人员，积极投入斗争第一线，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，和无产阶级革命派日日夜夜并肩战斗，英勇地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，使忠于毛主席的红心越炼越红。党委书记肖剑平，怀着誓死捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚强决心，在驻地无产阶级革命派斗争最困难的时刻，派出支左部队旗帜鲜明地支持了无产阶级革命派，被党委委员们称为“好班长”。师政委赵江，主管“三支”“两军”工作以来，深入第一线，哪里斗争形势最复杂，哪里就有他的足迹。一年多来，他走遍了五个支左地区，接触了数以万计的革命群众，召开过几十次座谈会，听取群众意见，和革命群众、支左人员共同战斗，被誉为“学习的好榜样”。
    最近，这个师党委光荣地出席了人民解放军北京部队炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，党委成员又一次幸福地见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他们决心牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，更加谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，进一步搞好思想革命化，沿着毛主席指引的航线继续前进。《解放军报》通讯员　新华社通讯员新华社记者　本报通讯员
