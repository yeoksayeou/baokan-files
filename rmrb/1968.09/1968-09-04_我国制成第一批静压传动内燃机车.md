China Successfully Produces First Batch of Hydrostatic Transmission Diesel Locomotives

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 3rd, amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory, Dalian Mining and Vehicle Factory, and Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory, along with relevant research and design units, have, in just one year and ten months, successfully researched, designed, and tested the first batch of hydrostatic transmission diesel locomotives in China. This achievement has brought China's industrial and mining diesel locomotive production technology to the forefront of the world.

	The first batch of hydrostatic (hydraulic) transmission diesel locomotives produced in China has three types: 80 horsepower, 120 horsepower, and 160 horsepower. After a period of trial operation, they were recently tested in Changsha, Hunan. The results showed that the main performance indicators of these three types of hydrostatic transmission diesel locomotives basically met the design technical requirements.

	The main advantages of hydrostatic transmission diesel locomotives are good traction performance, compact structure, simple operation, wide application range, and they are particularly suitable for shunting and underground transportation in industrial and mining enterprises. The production of these locomotives has added new traction power to China's narrow-gauge and standard-gauge railways for short-distance transportation.

	The successful production of 80 horsepower, 120 horsepower, and 160 horsepower hydrostatic transmission diesel locomotives is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我国制成第一批静压传动内燃机车
    据新华社三日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，常州内燃机车厂，大连工矿车辆厂，石家庄动力机械厂等单位的广大革命职工，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在有关科研设计单位的大力协助和支持下，仅用一年零十个月左右的时间，自行研究设计并试制成功了我国第一批静压传动内燃机车，使我国工矿内燃机车的生产技术，跨入了世界先进水平的行列。
    我国第一批试制成功的静压（即液压）传动内燃机车，共有八十马力，一百二十马力，一百六十马力三种。经过一段时间的试运行考验，最近在湖南长沙进行了集中鉴定。鉴定结果表明，这三种静压传动内燃机车的主要性能指标基本上都达到了设计技术要求。
    静压传动内燃机车的主要优点是：机车的牵引性能好，结构紧凑，操作简单，应用范围广，特别适用于工矿企业中的铁路调车与坑道内的运输作业。这种机车的制成，为我国窄轨铁路和准轨铁路的短途运输，增添了新的牵引动力。
    八十马力、一百二十马力、一百六十马力静压传动内燃机车的试制成功，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
