The Chinese government has received a letter from Senanayake, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers. In the letter, Senanayake, on behalf of the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers, warmly congratulates the establishment of revolutionary committees in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province).

Senanayake stated in the letter: "This is a historic milestone on the road to victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the greatest revolutionary leader of our times, Chairman Mao Zedong."

The letter states: We believe that Taiwan Province will definitely be liberated.

Senanayake's letter states: "The Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers warmly acclaims the great victory achieved by the revolutionary people of China under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

"China has now consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevented a capitalist restoration, and thus assured the oppressed peoples of the world that China will never change its political color and will become a reliable base for world revolution. We are delighted by this great achievement.

"The Bureau warmly acclaims this great achievement, which is not only a victory for the 700 million people of China but also a victory for all progressive and revolutionary peoples of the world who are still waging a struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries to win and maintain national independence, people's democracy, and socialism."
