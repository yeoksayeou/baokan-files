Albanian newspapers continuously publish editorials to warmly celebrate the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Comrades Ho Chi Minh and Shehu

A brilliant display of the combat friendship and revolutionary unity between the peoples of China and Albania

The editorials point out that the enemies of Albania should not forget the warning from the great Chinese people, that the aid from People's China to the Albanian people knows no borders

New China News Agency, Tirana, September 21st - Albanian newspapers on the 21st continued to publish editorials, warmly celebrating the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Comrades Ho Chi Minh and Shehu. The newspapers pointed out that this telegram is a brilliant display of the combat friendship and revolutionary unity between our two peoples, and is a great historical document of global significance.

The editorial in "Voice of the People" emphasized: We Albanian people are proud to have such a loyal friend as the great People's China. Under the personal leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, the People's China, tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become a great fortress of revolution and communism in the contemporary world. It has become a powerful base for world revolution, a bastion of Marxism-Leninism, and a steadfast and unshakable defender of the cause of freedom, socialism, and true security for all peoples of the world. We Albanian people are proud of the glorious victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the establishment of revolutionary committees in twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of People's China, excluding Taiwan Province.

The editorial pointed out that the existence of such a great People's China, with its immense human, economic, and military strength and bright prospects in all fronts of socialist construction, is a great blessing for the Albanian people and for all of humanity. The great People's China has become a powerful socialist country. The atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles in the hands of the seven hundred million Chinese people, who have been educated and nurtured by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, are not only for defending the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China but also for defending the freedom of the peoples of all countries, for defending the cause of revolution, and for the true peace of the world.

Our Party has united the Albanian people forever with such a giant, with such a great and powerful friend. Whether in good times or in difficult times, we feel that this friend is loyal and steadfast. The Albanian people cherish in their hearts the unforgettable words of the great leader of the brotherly Chinese people, Mao Zedong: "Believe me, comrades, no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and our two peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." Socialist Albania has always felt and now feels the sincere and powerful internationalist support of the brotherly Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong. Our people will never forget that when the imperialists, modern revisionists, and these enemies imposed a harsh blockade on Albania, attempting to strangle socialist Albania and force her to surrender, and most treacherously tried to sabotage our country's socialist construction, our Chinese brothers extended their strong and warm hands to us. Our brave and fearless people, under the wise and far-sighted leadership of the heroic Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, united in combat with the Chinese people and all revolutionary forces of the world, shattered the "iron curtain" of imperialism and modern revisionism, and advanced victoriously and forever forward.

People's China, in any situation, has shown through actions her loyalty to friends who share the same ideals and goals. She openly declares that imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries must consider that China and Albania are united, and that the Chinese people are sworn to be the strong backbone of the Albanian people. The great telegram from the seven hundred million Chinese people to our people inspires and encourages all revolutionaries and peoples of the world who are fighting against imperialism and modern revisionism. Our enemies should not forget the powerful internationalist support of the great Chinese people, nor forget the warning from the great Chinese people: anyone who dares to touch socialist Albania will meet their doom. Anyone who dares to lay a hand on the People's Republic of Albania must know that the aid from People's China to our people knows no borders. The fires lit by the enemy will burn down their own homes and eliminate the enemies of modern revisionism and imperialism from the face of the earth.

The editorial concludes by saying: The revolutionary unity and combat friendship between People's China and socialist Albania have multiplied our strength by millions. In any situation, we will always stand together and resolutely fight on the front lines against imperialism and revisionism. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, our two peoples and our two countries will forever raise high the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and advance bravely in the struggle for the cause of socialism and communism. The Albanian people will protect the combat friendship and revolutionary unity with the Chinese brothers like the apple of their eye, tempering and elevating this friendship and unity to a higher level.

The editorial in "Unity" published on the 20th and 21st continuously celebrated the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Comrades Ho Chi Minh and Shehu.

The editorial in "Unity" on the 20th said that the Albanian people, educated and nurtured by the Labor Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, feel honored and proud to have such a great and sincere friend as the People's Republic of China and its seven hundred million people. Our people pay special attention to the revolutionary process of People's China. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, People's China has become an invincible socialist fortress and a steadfast defender of the freedom and independence of the peoples of the world. She resolutely fights against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Union.

The editorial pointed out that the brotherly Chinese people have always stood by our people, which once again clearly proves that our friends and comrades-in-arms are everywhere. In the great work of socialist construction, in the glorious cause of revolution, and in the defense of the motherland, our country has never been and will never be isolated.

The editorial said that the Chinese Communist Party, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the glorious leader of the Chinese people and the closest friend of the Albanian people, has taken a clear revolutionary stance, which once again clearly shows that our country and party have consistently been guided by the absolutely correct Marxism-Leninism in the revolutionary process. This once again shows that the ironclad combat unity between our two parties and two countries has become a banner inspiring all revolutionaries and peoples of the world, who see that the friendly relations between China with its seven hundred million people and Albania with its two million people are a true example of friendship born and grown on the high principles of proletarian internationalism and Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial in "Unity" on the 21st pointed out that the Albanian people regard the multi-faceted victories of the brotherly Chinese people as their own victories. The telegram from Chairman Mao and his comrades has greatly deepened the love of our people for the brotherly Chinese people, greatly increased the indescribable joy of our people over the great victories achieved by our two peoples, and greatly strengthened the optimism of our people in further developing the struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism and forever raising high the banner of victory of Marxism-Leninism.

In recent days, Albanian newspapers "Labor," "Voice of Youth," and "Teacher's Voice" have also published editorials, warmly celebrating the telegram from the Chinese leaders to the Albanian leaders.

    新华社地拉那二十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚各报二十一日继续发表社论，热烈欢呼毛主席、林副主席、周总理给霍查同志和谢胡同志的电报。各报指出，这个电报是我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊和革命团结的力量和生命力的光辉表现，是具有世界意义的伟大历史文献。
    《人民之声报》的社论着重指出：我们阿尔巴尼亚人民为有伟大的人民中国这样忠实的朋友而感到自豪。伟大的人民中国是当代革命和共产主义的最伟大和最强大的堡垒。在杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命中得到了锤炼的人民中国，已成为社会主义的巨大堡垒，世界革命的强大基地，马克思列宁主义的旗手。她已成为敢于为抗击帝国主义和修正主义的侵略和压迫，为全世界的自由、社会主义和真正的安全的事业而斗争的各国人民的坚定和不动摇的捍卫者。我们阿尔巴尼亚人民为无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，为人民中国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区都建立了革命委员会而感到自豪。
    社论指出，现在世界上存在着这样一个伟大的人民中国，她的人力、经济和军事力量如此强大，在社会主义建设各个战线上的前途如此光明，这对于阿尔巴尼亚人民、对于整个人类来说，是极大的幸福。伟大的人民中国已成为一个强大的社会主义国家。掌握在受了伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的教导和思想的哺育的七亿中国人民手里的原子武器、氢弹和导弹，不仅是为捍卫中华人民共和国的主权服务的，而且也是为捍卫各国人民自由的利益，为捍卫革命的利益，为全世界的真正和平服务的。
    我们党把阿尔巴尼亚人民永远同这样的一个巨人，同如此伟大和强大的一个朋友联结在一起。无论是在美好的日子里，还是在困难的日子里，我们感到，这个朋友都是忠心耿耿的。阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟的中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的这样一段使人难忘的话铭记在自己的心上：“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚过去和现在都亲切地感受到兄弟的中国人民及其以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党对阿尔巴尼亚的真挚的强有力的国际主义支持。我国人民永远不会忘记：当帝国主义、修正主义这些敌人对阿尔巴尼亚实行严酷的封锁，企图扼杀社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和迫使她屈服，最阴险地竭力破坏我国的社会主义建设的时候，我们的朋友中国兄弟就亲切地向我们伸出他们的强有力的热情的手。英勇无畏的我国人民，凭着自己的炽热的爱国主义和崇高的英雄主义，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的英雄的劳动党的英明和有远见的领导下，同中国人民，同全世界的一切革命力量结成战斗的团结，粉碎了帝国主义、修正主义这些敌人的“铁的封锁线”，胜利地奋勇前进，并且永远向前迈进。
    人民中国在任何情况下，都在行动上表明她对抱有同一理想和同一目的的朋友的忠心。她公开宣告，帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派都必须考虑到中国和阿尔巴尼亚是联结在一起的，中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。伟大的七亿中国人民给我国人民的这个电报，使每一个阿尔巴尼亚人感到振奋，它激励和鼓舞着世界上为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义而斗争的一切革命者和各国人民。我们祖国的敌人不要忘记伟大的中国人民的这一强有力的国际主义支持，不要忘记伟大的中国人民发出的警告：谁要是碰一碰社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，谁就会自取灭亡。谁要是胆敢对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国动手，他就必须知道，人民中国对我国人民的援助是没有国界的。敌人点燃起来的战火会烧毁他们自己的老家，并把修正主义和帝国主义这些敌人从地球上消灭掉。
    社论最后说：人民中国和社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚之间的革命团结和战斗友谊，使我们的力量增强了千百万倍。在任何情况下，我们将永远站在一起，在反帝和反修的第一线坚决进行斗争。在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下的我们两国人民和我们两国，将永远高举战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜，将在为社会主义和共产主义事业而进行的斗争中奋勇前进。阿尔巴尼亚人民将象保护自己的眼珠一样保护同中国兄弟人民的战斗友谊和革命团结，他们将使这种友谊和团结得到锤炼，并把这种友谊和团结提高到更高的水平。
    《团结报》在二十日和二十一日连续发表社论，热烈欢呼毛主席、林副主席和周总理给霍查同志和谢胡同志的电报。
    《团结报》二十日的社论说，受劳动党和霍查同志教导、哺育的阿尔巴尼亚人民，为有中华人民共和国和七亿中国人民这样伟大的真诚的朋友而感到光荣和自豪。我国人民特别关注着人民中国的革命进程。在毛泽东同志的领导下，人民中国已成为不可攻克的社会主义堡垒，世界各国人民的自由和独立事业的忠实捍卫者。她坚决地抗击以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联为首的现代修正主义。
    社论指出，兄弟的中国人民不论在任何时候都站在我国人民一边，这就再一次清楚地证明，我国的朋友和战友遍天下，在社会主义建设的伟大工作中，在革命的光荣事业中，在保卫祖国的事业中，我们国家过去和今后都不是孤立的。
    社论说，中国人民的光荣的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友毛泽东同志英明领导下的中国共产党采取明确的革命立场，这就再一次清楚地说明：我们的国家和党是一贯地由马克思列宁主义这一绝对正确的指针指导革命进程的。这就又一次表明了存在于我们两党和两国之间的坚如磐石的战斗团结已成为鼓舞全世界的革命者和各国人民的旗帜，他们看到：拥有七亿人口的中国和拥有两百万人口的阿尔巴尼亚的友好关系，是在无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义的崇高原则基础上诞生和成长起来的真正友谊的典范。
    《团结报》二十一日的社论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟的中国人民的多方面的胜利看作是自己的胜利。毛泽东主席和他的战友们的电报大大加深了我国人民对兄弟的中国人民的热爱，大大增添了我国人民对我们两国人民所取得的巨大胜利的难以形容的喜悦，大大增强了我国人民对进一步开展反对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争、永远高举马克思列宁主义的胜利旗帜的乐观信心。
    连日来，阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》、《青年之声报》和《教师报》也分别发表社论，热烈欢呼中国领导人给阿尔巴尼亚领导人的电报。
