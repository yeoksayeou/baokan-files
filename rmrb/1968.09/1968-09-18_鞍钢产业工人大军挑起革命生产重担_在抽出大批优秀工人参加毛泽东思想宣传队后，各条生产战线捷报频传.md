The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fully bringing into play the leading role of the working class have greatly inspired the industrial workers of Anshan Steel who are striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have selected outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, which, under leadership and in an orderly manner, go to schools and units that have not done a good job in struggle-criticism-transformation. They bravely undertake the glorious mission of promoting struggle-criticism-transformation in these units. At the same time, with full political enthusiasm and a strong sense of political responsibility, they have taken up the dual burdens of class struggle and production in their enterprises.

Since August, Anshan Steel has seen frequent good news from all production lines, creating 161 new production records in just one month, which is seven times the number of new production records created in the first half of the year. The production levels of steel ingots, pig iron, and steel products have been rising steadily, the quality of various products has improved rapidly, and technological innovation projects have emerged one after another. Many plants and mines, such as the Iron Smelting Plant and the three major Steel Smelting Plants, which achieved excellent production results in the first half of the year, as well as the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Large Rolling Mill, Casting Pipe Plant, Medium Rolling Mill, Steel Rope Plant, and Gongzhuangling Iron Mine, have recently created new records since their inception. They have successfully developed more than ten kinds of urgently needed new products for the country.

The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel keep Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds and put them into action. The three steel smelting plants on the front line of steel production have, since mid-to-late August, sent a large number of outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. Revolution and production have become even more vibrant. Many veteran steelworkers say, "Chairman Mao is supporting us workers, and we must make Chairman Mao proud with excellent results in revolution and in producing more and better steel." Under the slogan of "reducing personnel but increasing production," many workers have voluntarily organized assault teams. Where there are difficulties, they rush to solve them. Where there are key issues, they go to address them, launching large-scale cooperation activities among workshops, furnaces, and shifts, thus ensuring the smooth completion of steel smelting production tasks.

    鞍钢产业工人大军挑起革命生产重担
    在抽出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队后，各条生产战线捷报频传
    据新华社沈阳电　伟大领袖毛主席关于充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的一系列最新指示，极大地鼓舞了正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的鞍钢产业工人大军。他们一面挑选优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，有领导、有步骤地到学校和那些没有搞好斗、批、改的单位去，勇敢地担负起毛主席交给的促进这些单位的斗、批、改的光荣使命；一面以饱满的政治热情和高度的政治责任感，挑起本企业抓革命、促生产的两副重担。
    八月以来，鞍钢各条生产战线捷报频传，一个月就创造了一百六十一项生产最新纪录，相当于上半年创造的生产新纪录的七倍。钢锭、生铁和钢材的生产水平节节上升，各种产品质量迅速提高，技术革新项目不断涌现。今年上半年夺得优异生产成绩的炼铁厂和三大炼钢厂以及无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、铸管厂、中型轧钢厂、钢绳厂、弓长岭铁矿等许多厂矿，最近又分别创造出开工以来的最新纪录，成功地试制出十多种国家急需的重要新产品。
    鞍钢的革命工人，把毛主席的最新指示时刻印在脑子里，落实在行动上。战斗在钢铁生产第一线上的三个炼钢厂，八月中、下旬抽出一大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队以后，革命和生产更加热气腾腾。许多炼钢老工人说，毛主席给我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定以搞好革命和多出钢、出好钢的出色成绩给毛主席争气。在“减人要增产”口号的鼓舞下，许多工人自动组织起突击队，那里有困难就奔向那里，那里是关键就到那里去解决，展开了工段与工段、炉与炉、班与班的大协作活动，从而保证了炼钢生产任务的顺利完成。
