In the powerful impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the cotton production in our country this year is in a great situation. In the vast cotton-growing areas in the south and north, the cotton plants are growing vigorously, with strong stems and abundant bolls. Millions of commune members are busily harvesting the new cotton, and the vast cotton-growing areas present a heartening scene of bumper harvest. This is another piece of good news in the full victory march of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and another victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of our country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have, on the basis of summing up the experience of last year's bumper cotton harvest, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war" and his important instruction that "cotton must be grasped," using revolution to command and promote production. This is the fundamental guarantee for the great situation of cotton production this year despite unfavorable natural conditions.

Since this year, the broad masses and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-growing areas of our country, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good way, and many problems can be solved in study classes," have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to consciously criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness, and have effectively promoted the thought revolution of the people. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels and with the help of the People's Liberation Army agricultural support troops, have launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism movement, launching a fierce attack on a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, spies, traitors, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Through the great criticism of the revisionist line of counter-revolutionary revisionism pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, the socialist consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres has been greatly heightened, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has been increasing. The thought of working for revolution has been further deeply rooted in people's minds. Thus, a solid ideological foundation has been laid for the victory of cotton production.

During the spring sowing period, many cotton-growing areas in the south and north suffered from droughts, low temperatures, and other natural disasters, which caused great difficulties in sowing cotton. The broad masses have used the boundless enthusiasm aroused in the revolutionary criticism movement to develop cotton production. They have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, bravely fighting against natural disasters, and finally overcoming the difficulties to ensure the timely sowing of cotton. In the cotton-growing areas of Shanxi Linyi, Shandong Gaotang, and some parts of Hebei, where the drought was severe, the commune members, taking the old fool as an example, "made up their minds, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," persisted in finding water sources, digging new wells, and building new canals, and used various methods to save water and irrigate rationally, ensuring the normal growth of cotton, making the stems strong and the bolls dense, and the prospect of a bumper harvest is bright. The broad cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and Hubei have respectively overcome the natural disasters of rain, low temperature, and drought this year, and the cotton plants are generally growing well, with some areas growing better than any other year.

At present, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cotton-growing areas, inspired by the great situation of revolution and production, are enthusiastically competing to go to work early and return late, diligently harvesting and carefully picking the bumper cotton. In many areas, the peasant masses are harvesting the new cotton while enthusiastically drumming and gonging to deliver the new cotton to the state, supporting the socialist construction of the country.

    无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利大进军中的又一喜讯
    我国棉花生产一派大好形势
    棉区广大农民正在勤收细拣丰收棉，不少地区一边采收新棉，一边向国家交售新棉
    新华社二十一日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的有力推动下，今年我国棉花生产形势一派大好。南北广大棉区，棉花长势喜人，株壮桃多，亿万人民公社社员正紧张地采收新棉，广大棉区呈现出振奋人心的丰收景象。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利大进军中的又一喜讯，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一胜利。
    我国产棉区的广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在总结去年棉花丰收经验的基础上，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大战略方针和“必须把棉花抓紧”的重要指示，以革命统帅和带动生产，是今年在自然条件不利的情况下，使棉花生产呈现出一派大好形势的根本保证。
    今年以来，我国棉区广大群众和革命干部，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地斗私批修，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，在各地各级革命委员会的领导和人民解放军支农部队的帮助下，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的革命大批判运动，向一小撮死不悔改的走资派、特务、叛徒和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，发动了猛烈的进攻。通过对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线的大批判，使广大革命群众和革命干部社会主义觉悟大大提高，革命干劲越来越足，为革命种田的思想进一步深入人心。这样，就为棉花生产的胜利进行奠定了牢固的思想基础。
    春播时期，南北不少棉区出现干旱、低温等自然灾害，给播种棉花造成很大困难。广大群众把在革命大批判中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到发展棉花生产上去。他们发扬艰苦奋斗，自力更生的革命精神，英勇地向自然灾害作斗争，终于战胜了困难，保证了棉花的适时播种。干旱较重的山西临猗、山东高唐和河北的一些棉区，社员们以老愚公为榜样，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，坚持不懈地找水源、打新井、修新渠，并用各种办法节约用水，合理灌溉，保证了棉花的正常生长，做到株壮桃密，丰收大有希望。江苏、安徽、上海和湖北的广大棉区，今年分别战胜了阴雨、低温、干旱等自然灾害，棉花长势普遍良好，有的地区棉花长得比以往任何一年都好。
    当前，棉区广大贫下中农在革命、生产一派大好形势的鼓舞下，正意气风发地争相早上工、晚收工，勤收细拣丰收棉。不少地区的农民群众一边采收新棉，一边敲锣打鼓地向国家交售新棉，支援国家的社会主义建设。
