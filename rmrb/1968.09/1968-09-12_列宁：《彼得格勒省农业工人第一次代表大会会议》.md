Title: Lenin: Report to the First Congress of Agricultural Workers of the Petrograd Province

The landlords and capitalists have been swept away, but within a very short time, new capitalists have emerged from among the kulaks, well-to-do peasants, and speculators. Often, these new capitalists oppress the workers even more harshly than the old landlords and capitalists. Our task is not only to sweep away the old capitalists but also to prevent the emergence of new capitalists, so that the power is completely, entirely, and absolutely in the hands of the laboring people, those who live by their labor.

    地主和资本家被扫除了，但在很短时间内，从富农、富裕农民和投机者当中又产生了新的资本家，他们往往比旧的地主和资本家更厉害地压迫工人。而我们必须解决的任务就是：不仅要扫除旧的资本家，而且要使新的资本家不能产生，使政权完全地、整个地、绝对地掌握在劳动的人，靠劳动为生的人的手里。
