On September 3, the graduating class of Beipingzi Junior Middle School in Donggou County, Liaoning, was about to leave school and head to the countryside to integrate with workers and peasants. Teachers and students gathered together, some sitting close to discuss heart-to-heart, others signing in the memorial book, writing parting words...

At this time, representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, Pan Hongde and Song Chuangui, sent by the commune, arrived at the school. Upon arriving at the school, they did not go to the office but immediately went to the classrooms, listening to the students' speeches, carefully flipping through the students' "parting words." Some wrote in the book: "May you spread your wings and soar far." Others even wrote, "We part today..." and so on.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." However, some students exchanged these bourgeois sentiments. Old Pan thought: this is a class struggle. What hopes are expressed, what parting words are left, this is a matter of guiding the youth to take which path. Going to the countryside is to work hard and truly integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, or to "get some experience" and then "spread wings and soar far"? This is a struggle between two lines on the issue of sending educated youth to the countryside. Chairman Mao sent us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the school, and we will not allow anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought to exist.

Therefore, they pointed out sharply to the students: writing parting words seems to be a small matter, but these small matters have a big direction. Under Old Pan's suggestion, the school decided to postpone the graduation ceremony by one day to add a necessary revolutionary criticism class before graduation. The next day, the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the integration of educated youth with workers and peasants, severely criticized the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "going to the countryside to get some experience" and "becoming an official" by China's Khrushchev, greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle among the revolutionary teachers and students. Many students deeply felt: "We have been tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although our class consciousness has greatly improved, but compared to the poor and lower-middle peasants, we are still far behind. We must forever learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and integrate with them for life."

In this school, for many years, what people have neglected as small matters have been acutely discovered and promptly solved after the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the school. Everyone deeply felt: how much the rural schools need the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage!

    从小事情里抓大方向
    九月三日，辽宁东沟县北井子初级中学毕业班的学生就要离开学校，走上与工农相结合的道路。师生们有的围坐在一起促膝谈心，有的在纪念本上签字，书写临别赠言……。
    这时，公社选派的贫下中农优秀代表潘洪德、宋传贵同志来到了学校。他们到学校后，没有进办公室，立刻扎到教学班里，倾听着学生们的发言，细心地翻阅着学生们的“临别赠言”。有的在本子上写着：“祝你高展巨翅，鹏程万里”。有的甚至写着“即日要分别，……”等等。
    毛主席教导我们：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”可是一些学生却互相赠送这些资产阶级的东西。老潘想：这就是一场阶级斗争。提什么希望，留什么赠言，这是关系到引导青年走什么道路的问题。到农村是脚踏实地进行改造，真正和贫下中农结合在一块，还是去“镀镀金”将来好“展巨翅，得鹏程”？这就是在知识青年上山下乡问题上的两条路线斗争。毛主席派我们贫下中农来管理学校，我们决不允许任何不符合毛泽东思想的东西存在。
    于是，他们就向学生们尖锐地指出：写赠言看来是件小事，可是这些小问题里有大方向。在老潘的建议下，学校决定把毕业典礼推迟一天召开，补上毕业前一堂不可缺少的革命大批判课。第二天，全校革命师生又学习了毛主席关于知识青年要与工农群众相结合的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫下乡“镀金”、“当官”等反动的修正主义谬论，大大提高了广大革命师生的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。许多学生深有感触地说：“我们经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，虽然阶级觉悟有了很大提高，但是比起贫下中农还相差很远很远。我们要永远向贫下中农学习，一辈子和贫下中农结合在一起。”
    在这个学校，多少年来被人们忽视的所谓小事，在贫下中农管理学校后就被敏锐地发现，并及时地得到了解决。大家深有所感地说：农村的学校是多么需要贫下中农来管理呵！
