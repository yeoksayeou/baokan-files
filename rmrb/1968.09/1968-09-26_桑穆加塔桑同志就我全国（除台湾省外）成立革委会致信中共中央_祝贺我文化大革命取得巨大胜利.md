    Comrade Samaraweera of the CPC Central Committee on the Establishment of Revolutionary Committees Nationwide (Excluding Taiwan Province) and Celebrates the Great Victory of the Cultural Revolution

    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, September 24 - On September 18, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Ceylon, Samaraweera, on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPC, sent a letter of congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, celebrating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province). The full text of the letter is as follows:

    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,

    Dear Comrades,

    On the occasion of the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province), the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon extends to you its warmest and most heartfelt congratulations.

    We are immensely pleased with the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, where revolutionary committees—the organs of revolutionary power of the dictatorship of the proletariat—have been successfully established throughout the country.

    This is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is a victory of the correct Marxist-Leninist thought of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, over the revisionist thought of the Chinese Khrushchev.

    At the same time, this is a victory for the entire international revolutionary movement. It is a great source of encouragement and inspiration for all oppressed peoples who are struggling to free themselves from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism.

    This victory is also a great blow to world imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, especially when they are facing major contradictions at home and are tottering under the blows of the people.

    The thorough defeat of the Chinese Khrushchev and his pernicious ideas, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout your great country, the maintenance and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, and the consolidation of China as a base of the world revolution—all these are invaluable contributions to the final victory of world socialism.

    We once again express our respect to you and to your great party led by the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong. We wish you greater victories in the struggle to carry the revolution through to the end.

    Fraternal greetings,

    Samaraweera
    General Secretary, Communist Party of Ceylon

    桑穆加塔桑同志就我全国（除台湾省外）成立革委会致信中共中央
    祝贺我文化大革命取得巨大胜利
    新华社科伦坡二十四日电　锡兰共产党总书记桑穆加塔桑九月十八日代表锡共中央给中国共产党中央委员会一封贺信，祝贺我国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立革命委员会。贺信全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在中国所有的省份和自治区（除台湾省外）成立革命委员会之际，锡兰共产党中央委员会向你们致以热烈和衷心的祝贺。
    我们对伟大的中华人民共和国在全国各地胜利成立革命委员会——无产阶级专政的革命权力机关——这一无产阶级文化大革命的巨大胜利，感到无比的高兴。
    这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的正确的马克思列宁主义思想对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义思想的胜利。
    同时，这是整个国际革命运动的胜利，是正在为摆脱帝国主义、封建主义、资本主义桎梏而斗争的一切被压迫人民得到巨大激励和鼓舞的源泉。
    这一胜利也是对世界帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的巨大打击，特别是当它们在国内面临重大矛盾和在人民打击下摇摇欲坠的时候。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的恶毒思想的彻底失败，毛泽东思想在你们伟大的祖国各地的胜利，中国的无产阶级专政的维护和加强，中国这个世界革命的基地的巩固，这些是对世界社会主义的最后胜利作出的无可估量的贡献。
    我们再一次向你们和以当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的你们伟大的党致敬，祝你们在把革命进行到底的斗争中取得更大的胜利。致以
    兄弟般的敬礼
    锡兰共产党总书记　桑穆加塔桑
