The Revolutionary Committee of the Yakeshi Mechanical Repair Factory in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has, on the basis of extensively and deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism, been continuously fighting against old habits and forces, firmly believing in and relying on the broad revolutionary staff, fully exerting the leadership role of the working class, and has greatly advanced the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the unit.

As the revolutionary criticism deepens step by step, the broad revolutionary staff of the Yakeshi Mechanical Repair Factory have increasingly strong demands for reforming all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. In this new situation, the question of whether to boldly lead the masses forward or fall behind the masses is a serious issue facing the factory's Revolutionary Committee.

In March of this year, the factory's Revolutionary Committee carried out a reform of the old management structure, merging departments and streamlining management personnel to strengthen the production front line. However, when the reform plan was presented to the workers, the workers criticized the Revolutionary Committee for taking too small steps. The criticism from the workers caused a strong reaction within the Revolutionary Committee. Most comrades felt that the criticism was to the point, but a few comrades complained that the masses had "impetuousness."

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Leadership must be at the forefront of the movement, not lagging behind it." The members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, conducted a rectification. They fully exerted the leadership role of the working class, took the workers as their teachers, listened to the opinions of the working masses, and conducted a comprehensive survey of the thoughts of the entire factory's staff. They discovered that "the majority of the masses have awakened, have made up their minds, and are willing to carry out reforms," and moreover, they demand to advance in big strides. This made the members of the Revolutionary Committee realize: the working class is the most thorough in revolutionary spirit. In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, it is not the masses who are "impatient," but the leadership who is slow. As a revolutionary leadership cadre, one must take big strides to lead the broad masses of workers forward. On the basis of raising awareness, the Revolutionary Committee took a resolute attitude, streamlined the organization and personnel again, improved the leadership style. Old worker Li Cai happily said: "If we do it this way, our factory will catch up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment."

The Revolutionary Committee also felt that whether to believe in the broad masses without doubt or to be half-believing and half-doubting is a key issue in whether the struggle, criticism, and transformation can be carried out well. The third workshop's tooth box group had three workers suggesting that the "small contract" system, which was praised by the Chinese Khrushchev during his "inspection" of the Inner Mongolia forest area, be changed to a "flow production" system. The committee chairman and revolutionary leading cadre Ni Guochen agreed wholeheartedly when he heard this, but he did not take any action. The deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and military representative Ren Xingang asked him what was going on, and he said: "The initiative is good, but since the factory was established, the 'small contract' system has been in place for a full ten years. If we suddenly change it, will it cause chaos? Let's wait and see what the higher-ups say." Ren Xingang knew that the "Sixteen Points" had long since clearly stated the combat tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and now, the struggle, criticism, and transformation should be put on the important agenda. For the demands raised by the workers, both acknowledging them as good and fearing chaos is a half-believing and half-doubting attitude towards the masses. He sincerely said: the initiative proposed by the workers is in line with the direction of the movement. Ni Guochen raised his awareness and examined his private thoughts on this issue. Subsequently, they discussed and specially assigned people to go to the tooth box group, and together with the workers, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide this reform. Because the direction is correct and the path is right, the broad masses of workers enthusiastically supported it, and this reform was quickly completed. Practice has proven that not only did it not cause "chaos," but it greatly improved work efficiency. Under the condition of continuously improving product quality, the quantity of products increased by two and a half times compared to before, and the long-standing problem of "tight in the latter half of the month, loose in the former half, and urgent in the middle" was solved.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm," "we must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit." The struggle, criticism, and transformation in this factory present a lively and prosperous scene. At this time, on the issue of how to respect the masses' pioneering spirit, different opinions emerged within the Revolutionary Committee. Some committee members believed that respect means that the leadership should not interfere, otherwise it will affect the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm. Most committee members did not agree with this view. They believed that true respect is active guidance, and everything should be done according to Mao Zedong Thought, which is the most enthusiastic support and greatest care for the masses' pioneering spirit. In order to fully exert the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the committee members went to various workshops, participated in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and led the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Before the Cultural Revolution, a small handful of capitalist roaders in this factory regarded the workers in the boiler room as "mob," specially assigned a group of people to supervise them, and even named it the "safety production" system. This "safety production" system was completely a restraint on the workers, but accidents still occurred frequently. This time, the workers dragged the capitalist roaders in the factory to the scene for struggle and criticism. On the basis of deep struggle and criticism, they abolished the unreasonable management system originally formulated by the capitalist roaders. Through the revolutionary criticism, the sense of responsibility and revolutionary discipline of the working class were further strengthened, and the boiler room, which used to have frequent accidents, became an advanced unit without accidents.

    牙克石机械大修厂革委会遵循毛主席教导充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    倾听工人群众意见认真搞好本单位斗批改
    随着革命大批判步步深入，全厂职工对改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑的要求，一天比一天强烈。厂革委会决心拜工人为师，采取坚决态度，精简机构和人员，改进领导作风，和群众一起，在斗、批、改中大踏步前进。
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区牙克石林业管理局机械大修厂革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在广泛深入开展革命大批判的基础上，不断地同旧的习惯势力作斗争，坚定地相信和依靠广大革命职工，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，把本单位的斗、批、改大大向前推进了一步。
    随着革命大批判的步步深入，牙克石机械大修厂的广大革命职工，对改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑的要求，一天比一天强烈。在这种新形势下，是大胆领导群众前进，还是落在群众后面，这是摆在厂革委会面前的一个严重问题。
    今年三月，这个厂革委会曾对旧的管理机构进行了一次改革，合并科室，精简管理人员，充实生产第一线。可是，改革方案一和工人见面，工人就批评革委会的步子迈得太小。来自工人的批评在革委会内引起了强烈的反响，大部分同志认为，这批评一针见血地戳到了领导的痛处，也有个别同志埋怨群众犯了“急性病”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“领导一定要走在运动的前面，不要落在它的后面。”厂革委会成员对照毛主席的教导，在斗、批、改中进行了一次整风。他们充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，拜工人为师，倾听工人群众的意见，对全厂广大职工的思想进行了全面摸底，发现“群众的多数有了觉悟，有了决心，自愿实行改革”，而且要求大踏步前进。这使革委会成员认识到：工人阶级最富于彻底的革命精神。在斗、批、改中，不是群众“急”了，而是领导慢了。作为一个革命的领导班子，必须迈开大步，才能带领广大工人群众前进。在提高认识的基础上，革委会采取坚决的态度，又一次精简了机构，精简了人员，改进了领导作风。老工人李才高兴地说：“都照这样办，咱们厂就跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署了。”
    厂革委会还体会到，对广大群众是坚信不疑还是半信半疑，这是能否搞好斗、批、改的一个关键问题。一车间牙箱组有三位工人建议把中国赫鲁晓夫到内蒙古林区“视察”时吹捧过的“小包工”制度，改为“流水作业”制度。革委会主任、革命领导干部倪国臣听到后，满口答应，可就是没有行动。革委会副主任、军队代表任新岗，问他咋回事，他说：“这倡议好是好，可是，从建厂以来，就搞‘小包工’制度，这条道走了整整十年了，乍一改会不会乱了套？还是看看上头的动静再说吧。”任新岗知道《十六条》中早就明确交代了一斗、二批、三改的战斗任务，现在，应该把斗批改提到重要日程上来了。对于工人提出的要求，既承认好，又怕搞乱，这是对待群众半信半疑的思想。他诚恳地说：工人提出的建议，符合运动的大方向。倪国臣提高了认识，检查了自己在这个问题上的私心杂念。随后，他们合计了一下，专门抽出人来下到牙箱组，和工人一起活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导这次改革。由于方向对，路子正，广大职工热烈支持，这项改革很快就完成了。实践证明，不但没有“乱套”，而且大大提高了工效，在不断提高产品质量的情况下，产品数量比原来增加了两倍半，还解决了积了十年之久的“下半月紧，上半月松，中间急得头发蒙”的老大难问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”，“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。”这个厂的斗、批、改，呈现出一片热气腾腾的大好景象。这时，在如何尊重群众首创精神问题上，革委会内部又出现了不同意见。个别委员认为，尊重，就是领导上不要插手去管，否则会影响群众的革命积极性。大部分委员不同意这种看法，他们认为：真正的尊重，是积极引导，完全按照毛泽东思想办事，才是对群众首创精神最热情的支持和最大的爱护。为了充分发挥群众参加斗、批、改的积极性，革委会的委员们分头下到各车间，参加斗、批、改，领导斗、批、改。
    文化大革命以前，这个厂的一小撮走资派把锅炉房的工人看成“群氓”，专门配备了一伙人来监工，还美其名曰“安全生产”制度。这种“安全生产”制度完全是卡工人的，结果，事故仍然不断出现。这次，工人们把厂内走资派拉到现场来进行了批斗。在批深批透的基础上，他们把原来走资派制定的不合理的管理制度破除了。通过革命大批判，工人阶级的责任感和革命纪律性进一步加强，原来老出事故的锅炉房，成了无事故的先进单位。
