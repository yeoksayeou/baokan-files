Mao Zedong Thought is the compass, the People's Commune is the reliance.

The leader of the Chenjiazhuang Brigade, Chenjiazhuang People's Commune, Qufu County, Shandong, Chen Yimei

In 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao made an extremely important comment on the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. Chairman Mao pointed out in his comment: "This is a well-run cooperative, from which many beneficial experiences can be drawn." Chairman Mao's comment was the greatest concern, support, encouragement, and spur for us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Chenjiazhuang. From then on, we became even more determined to follow the socialist path and devote our lives to revolution under Chairman Mao's leadership.

On August 9, 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Establish People's Communes." Chairman Mao spoke the words in our hearts, expressing the wishes of five hundred million peasants, and pointing out the path to communism for us. On September 8, the Chenjiazhuang People's Commune was born. Over the past ten years, the path of the People's Commune has become broader and broader for us, and the direction of socialism has become brighter and brighter. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the people of Chenjiazhuang have changed their minds and changed their clothes, bringing about tremendous changes.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "self-reliance" and "hard struggle," relying on the advantages of the People's Commune being big and public, declaring war on nature, and thoroughly transforming the eight hundred mu of wasteland that had been impossible to change for many years. We planted more than sixty thousand willow and poplar trees on the barren sand flats, two thousand apple trees, two thousand jujube trees, and many pear, apricot, and grape trees. Now the wasteland has become a place shaded by green trees and has become a fruit-producing area. This year alone, we can harvest about one hundred thousand jin of apples. In this short period, we also carried out large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, dug seven large wells, added seven electric and diesel engines, turning all the land in the brigade into irrigated land that is not affected by drought or waterlogging, fully realizing water conservancy, irrigation electrification, and mechanization. This year, our brigade encountered a severe drought that had not been seen in decades, but the machines on the wells roared day and night, and water flowed everywhere. All kinds of crops were watered again and again. Because we changed the natural landscape, agricultural production developed year by year. In 1952, the grain yield per mu was 269 jin. In 1955, when our great leader Chairman Mao made his comment, the yield was 450 jin per mu. Last year, it reached 910 jin per mu. This year, we had another bumper harvest in agriculture. The 586 mu of wheat in the summer season had an average yield of 426 jin per mu. After the special bumper harvest of wheat, the 93 households in Chenjiazhuang Brigade, to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao, handed over 140,000 jin of grain in one go, which was more than twice the annual procurement quota. Now the autumn crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Our village has also been connected to high-voltage power lines, and the brigade has loudspeakers. There are tractors for plowing, mills for grinding, and threshers for threshing. More than 90% of the commune members have moved into new tiled houses. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically sing: "The People's Commune has great power, turning wastelands into oases, agricultural water conservancy, Chairman Mao instructs us to do it resolutely, and the happy life will last forever."

In the ten years that Chenjiazhuang Brigade has advanced on the road of the People's Commune, it has been ten years of life-and-death struggle with the enemy, ten years of growing and strengthening in the fierce struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. Chairman Mao taught us: "The enemy will definitely look for opportunities to show themselves. They are not reconciled to the loss of the country and communism." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong and Qufu maliciously slandered the People's Commune, spreading the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" to restore capitalism, saying that the People's Commune was "established too early" and "messed up." While creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, they once supported bad people to seize the leadership of Chenjiazhuang Brigade. They protected landlords and rich peasants on all fronts and suppressed and expelled poor and lower-middle peasants. Our brigade's collective economy was once seriously damaged. Just at this critical moment, in 1962, the Party Central Committee held the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there are still classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Chenjiazhuang. Under the care and support of the higher-level Party, we went through repeated struggles and finally took back the leadership of the brigade. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the advantages of the People's Commune, we mustered greater enthusiasm, dug open the wells that the enemy had filled, built them, and bought machines; we restored the brick kilns that the enemy had destroyed and bought brick-making machines. The enemy cut down the trees, and we planted rows and rows of fruit trees on the wasteland and also improved the land. Soon, the collective economy of the People's Commune recovered and developed again, and the enemy was shamefully defeated!

However, the struggle between the two lines did not stop. In 1964, the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Shandong came to spread the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small group" which was "left" in form but right in essence. It was not until Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Twenty-three Articles" that, under our poor and lower-middle peasants' resolute struggle, their counter-revolutionary plot was foiled.

Looking back on the past ten years, in the stormy waves of class struggle, it was Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that pointed out the direction for us. In those days of dark clouds and strong winds, it was our beloved Chairman Mao who pointed out the direction for us poor and lower-middle peasants, supported us, and gave us courage, enabling us to smash the restoration plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents time and time again.

In the past ten years, Chenjiazhuang Brigade has undergone countless changes, and the greatest change has been in people's spiritual outlook. The great proletarian cultural revolution has raised the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Chenjiazhuang Brigade to a new level. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants never part with Chairman Mao's sacred book, never part with Chairman Mao's quotations, and never part with Mao Zedong Thought in their work. Everywhere in the fields and farmlands are classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, everywhere are battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have never been as full of spirit and fighting spirit as they are today.

Looking back on the victorious road we have traveled, we cannot help but shout over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Even if we use the blue sky as paper and sea water as ink, we cannot write enough about Chairman Mao's kindness to us, nor can we write enough about the boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Chenjiazhuang Brigade to Chairman Mao. In the fierce and sharp class struggle, we have come to understand a truth: Following Chairman Mao is light, is happiness, is victory! Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline, the People's Commune is our iron reliance, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chenjiazhuang have made up our minds to devote our lives to revolution with Chairman Mao, and the broad road of the People's Commune is set!

    毛泽东思想是指针，人民公社是靠山
    山东曲阜县陈家庄公社陈家庄大队领导班子负责人　陈以梅
    一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席对陈家庄农业生产合作社作了极为重要的批示。毛主席在批示中指出：“这是一个办得很好的合作社，可以从这里吸取许多有益的经验。”毛主席的批示，是对我们陈家庄贫下中农和革命干部的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。从此，我们更加坚定了走社会主义道路、跟着毛主席干一辈子革命的决心。
    一九五八年八月九日，伟大领袖毛主席发出了“还是办人民公社好”的伟大号召。毛主席说出了我们贫下中农心里话，表达了五亿农民的心愿，给我们指出了通向共产主义的道路。九月八日，陈家庄人民公社就宣告诞生了。十年来，人民公社的路子，俺越走越宽广，社会主义的方向越奔越光明。在毛主席革命路线的指引下，陈家庄人换思想地换装，发生了翻天覆地的巨大变化。
    人民公社化以后，我们遵照毛主席“自力更生”、“艰苦奋斗”的教导，依靠人民公社一大二公的优越性，向大自然宣战，彻底改造了多少年来没法改造的八百亩荒滩。我们在寸草不长的沙滩上栽了六万多棵柳树、杨树，栽了两千多棵苹果树、两千多棵枣树，还栽了许多梨树、杏树、葡萄。现在荒滩已经变为绿树成荫的地方，已经成了水果之乡。光苹果今年就能收十万斤左右。在这短短的时间里，我们还大搞农田水利建设，打了七眼大机井，添置了七部电动机、柴油机，使全大队的土地变成旱涝保丰收的水浇地，全部实现了水利化，并且实现了灌溉电气化、机械化。今年我们大队遇到几十年未有的特大干旱，但是，机井上的机器日夜轰隆隆地响，到处流水哗哗地淌，各种庄稼都浇了一遍又一遍。因为改变了自然面貌，农业生产年年发展。一九五二年粮食亩产量是二百六十九斤，一九五五年伟大领袖毛主席对俺们批示的时候，亩产量是四百五十斤，去年已达到九百一十斤。今年又是个农业大丰收，夏季五百八十六亩小麦，平均亩产达到四百二十六斤。小麦获得特大丰收后，我们仅有九十三户的陈家庄大队，贫下中农为了向毛主席敬献忠心，一次就交售了十四万斤粮食，等于全年征购任务的两倍以上。眼下秋季作物长势喜人，丰收在望。我们村里还扯上了高压线，大队里有广播大喇叭。耕地有拖拉机，磨面有磨面机，打场有脱粒机。社员百分之九十以上都住上了新瓦房。广大贫下中农热情唱道：“人民公社力量大，荒滩变绿洲，农田水利化，毛主席指示我们坚决办，幸福的生活万万年。”
    我们陈家庄大队在人民公社化道路上前进的十年，是和阶级敌人生死搏斗的十年，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈的斗争中成长壮大起来的十年。毛主席教导我们说：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东、曲阜的代理人，大肆诬蔑人民公社，大刮“三自一包”、“四大自由”复辟资本主义的妖风，说什么人民公社“办早了”，“搞糟了”。他们在大造反革命舆论的同时，还一度扶植坏人篡夺了陈家庄大队的领导权。他们多方面保护地主、富农，打击排挤贫下中农。我们大队集体经济一度遭到严重破坏。就在这一关键时刻，一九六二年党中央召开了八届十中全会，伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”毛主席的教导给我们陈家庄贫下中农和革命干部指明了前进的方向，在上级党的关怀和支持下，我们经过反复斗争，终于又把大队的领导权夺了回来。我们贫下中农在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，依靠人民公社的优越性，鼓足了更大的干劲，把被敌人填死的机井扒开，修建起来，买了机器；把敌人破坏的砖瓦窑恢复起来，买了轧瓦机。敌人把树砍掉，我们又在荒滩栽上成排成排的果树，并且修整了土地。很快，人民公社集体经济又恢复发展起来了，阶级敌人可耻地失败了！
    但是，两条路线的斗争并未停止。一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫在山东的代理人又来搞“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的形“左”而实右的资产阶级反动路线。直到毛主席亲自主持制定的“二十三条”下达后，在我们贫下中农的坚决斗争下，他们的反革命阴谋才破了产。
    回想十年来，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线给我们指明了方向。在那乌云翻滚，黑风阵阵的日子里，是敬爱的毛主席他老人家给我们贫下中农指明了方向，撑了腰，壮了胆，使我们一次又一次地粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的复辟阴谋。
    十年来我们陈家庄大队千变化，万变化，人的精神面貌是最大的变化。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使陈家庄大队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动又提高到一个新的水平。广大的贫下中农人人手不离毛主席的宝书，口不离毛主席的语录，办事不离毛泽东思想。田间地头到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处是斗私批修的战场，毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，广大贫下中农从来没有象今天这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。
    回想我们走过来的胜利道路，我们情不自禁地一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”用蓝天做纸，海水当墨，也写不尽毛主席对我们的恩情，写不尽陈家庄大队贫下中农对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。在激烈尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们认识到一个真理：紧跟毛主席就是光明，就是幸福，就是胜利！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的命根子，人民公社是我们的铁靠山，我们陈家庄广大贫下中农跟毛主席干一辈子革命的决心是下定了，人民公社的康庄大道是走定了！
