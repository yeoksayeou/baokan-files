Albania's vegetable production has achieved a good harvest. Many agricultural cooperatives have already exceeded their production targets.

According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, Albania's vast agricultural cooperatives and agricultural enterprises have achieved a good harvest in vegetable production. The amount of vegetables supplied to the market in the first half of this year increased by 57% compared to the same period last year.

This year, the area planted with vegetables in Albania increased by 20% compared to last year, and the yield increased even more. Many agricultural cooperatives and agricultural enterprises have already exceeded the per-hectare yield targets for the final year of the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970).

Due to the increase in vegetable production, this year Albania's vegetable supply to the people has exceeded any previous year. The spring vegetables also hit the market earlier than in previous years. Currently, the vegetable gardens of various agricultural cooperatives have begun sowing winter vegetables. To meet the growing market demand for fresh vegetables, the area sown with winter vegetables will be expanded.

    阿蔬菜生产获得好收成
    许多合作社已超额完成生产指标
    新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚广大农业生产合作社和农业企业的蔬菜生产获得了好收成。今年上半年市场上供应的蔬菜数量比去年同期增加了百分之五十七。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚种植蔬菜的面积比去年扩大了百分之二十，而产量增加得更多。许多农业生产合作社和农业企业已经超额完成了第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）最后一年每公顷产量的指标。
    由于蔬菜产量的增加，今年阿尔巴尼亚人民的蔬菜供应量超过以往任何一年。春菜上市也比往年都要早。目前，各农业社的菜园已经在开始播种冬菜。为了满足市场对新鲜蔬菜的日益增长的需要，冬菜的播种面积将要扩大。
