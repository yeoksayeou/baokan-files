	Revolutionary teachers and students from various schools in Shuiyuan People's Commune, Campu County, Liaoning Province, have, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, established an education revolutionary committee with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students. This ensures that the leadership of the schools is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a scene of them studying the issues of struggle, criticism, and reform in schools under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.
