Albania stands as a great beacon in Europe. The Soviet revisionist group has betrayed the October Revolution, colluded with the U.S. imperialists, and turned the Soviet Union into a counter-revolutionary center.

New China News Agency, Tirana, September 25th - The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 24th, strongly condemning and exposing the Soviet revisionists' shameless slander against the People's Republic of Albania.

The editorial, titled "What Are They Trying to Deceive Themselves and Others With?", points out that the Soviet revisionist news agency TASS has recently spread "shocking" news in two of its dispatches from Rome and Athens, claiming that "the leaders of Tirana are secretly attempting to approach the West" and are seeking "aid and protection" from the West; "they are making preliminary attempts to rebuild relations with Greece and resolve disputes between the two countries."

The editorial states that we are not surprised by these despicable slanders. Such slander is not the first time, and it may not be the last. The revisionist TASS, Moscow Radio, and various Soviet revisionist publications are frantically spreading fabricated lies against socialist Albania, in competition with the Western imperialist press.

The editorial points out that the whole world knows that socialist Albania is not a commodity for sale. She stands firm on the Adriatic coast like a rock, and she stands as a great beacon of socialism and revolution in Europe. Because of Albania's brave stance, her enemies, imperialism and revisionism, are terrified. It is not Albania that bows down to imperialism, but the Soviet revisionists. They are the ones who seek aid from imperialism, open their country's doors to imperialist monopolies, and sell the wealth and sweat of the Soviet people to the capitalist trusts of the United States, Britain, Italy, France, and Japan. It is the Soviet revisionists who, like venomous snakes, are coiled around the necks of the Soviet people, and after burying the victories of the October Revolution, have turned Lenin and Stalin's glorious homeland into an imperialist country, into a major counter-revolutionary center in the world, plotting against the peoples of various countries and carrying out fascist-style aggression. It is the Soviet revisionists, not the Albanian people, who maintain secret ties with the West and Greece. As for Greece, the former Soviet ambassador to Albania, Levshkin, is in Athens on a mission, and it is natural that he will strengthen close collaboration with the fascist rulers of Athens and plot against Albania.

The editorial asks, why are the Soviet revisionists doing all these despicable deeds? Why do TASS, Moscow Radio, and Soviet revisionist newspapers not mention to the Soviet people the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the government of the People's Republic of Albania on August 22nd regarding the Soviet revisionist invasion of Czechoslovakia, not mention Comrade Shehu's speech in the People's Assembly, not mention Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, and not mention the warm telegrams from Comrade Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders to Comrades Hoxha and Shehu? Do they think they can cover up these great, historically significant revolutionary actions with fabrications from some Roman newspapers or their criminal and slanderous accomplices, such as some despicable officials in Athens? They can dream during the day, but they cannot cover the sky with one hand.

The editorial points out that we know that after the strong condemnation by the Albanian people of the aggressive and enslaving Warsaw Pact, the Soviet revisionist chauvinists will not remain idle. We have known in the past and know now that spreading slander against socialist Albania is part of their conspiracy and fascist hostile actions against socialist Albania. However, experience has taught our enemies that Albania is a hard bone. She will not be frightened, she will not yield, she is invincible. We have never and will never seek aid from imperialists and their lackeys or revisionists. We do not provoke anyone, but if anyone touches us, let them deeply understand that they are seeking their own doom. Because we have all the means and strength to defend ourselves and achieve victory.

We are also not isolated. The great power of 700 million Chinese people stands with us. The revolutionaries of the whole world are with us. The progressive people of the world, including the Soviet people, stand with us.

Let the enemies of Albania go ahead and slander and fabricate! Let them dream during the day! The more they do so, the more miserable they will be.

    阿《人民之声报》发表社论痛斥苏修叛徒的无耻诽谤
    阿尔巴尼亚象巨大明灯屹立在欧洲
    苏修集团背叛十月革命，同美帝勾结，把苏联变成一个反革命中心
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十四日发表社论，严正谴责和揭露苏修叛徒对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的无耻诽谤。
    这篇题为《他们以什么自欺欺人？》的社论指出，苏修的通讯社塔斯社，最近几天在它的来自罗马和雅典的两条消息中散布“耸人听闻”的消息，说什么“地拉那的领导人通过秘密的外交渠道，正在设法同西方接近”并要求西方“援助和保护”；“正在为同希腊重建关系，为解决两国之间的争执进行初步的试探。”
    社论说，对于这些卑鄙的诽谤，我们绝不感到惊奇。这种诽谤，并不是第一次，而且也许不是最后一次。修正主义的塔斯社、莫斯科电台以及苏修的种种报刊，正在同西方帝国主义的报业同行竞相疯狂地散布反对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的想入非非的捏造。
    社论指出，全世界都知道，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚不是出售的商品。她象磐石一样屹立在亚得里亚海岸，她象一盏社会主义和革命的巨大明灯屹立在欧洲。由于阿尔巴尼亚的英勇的立场，她的敌人帝国主义和修正主义吓得要死。向帝国主义卑躬屈膝的不是阿尔巴尼亚，而是苏联修正主义者，正是他们请求帝国主义的援助，向帝国主义垄断资本敞开本国的大门，正是他们把苏维埃国土的财富和苏联工人的血汗出卖给美国、英国、意大利、法国和日本的资本主义托辣斯。正是苏联修正主义者象毒蛇一样盘在苏联人民的脖子上，在葬送了十月革命的胜利成果以后，把列宁和斯大林的光荣的祖国变成了一个帝国主义国家，变成了世界上一个主要的反革命中心，对各国人民耍弄阴谋和进行法西斯式的侵略。同西方和希腊保持着秘密联系的正是苏联修正主义者，而不是阿尔巴尼亚人民。至于希腊，苏联前驻阿尔巴尼亚大使列维希金，正带着一定使命呆在雅典，十分自然，他会同雅典的法西斯统治者加强反阿尔巴尼亚的密切合作和策划反阿尔巴尼亚的阴谋。
    社论说，为什么苏联修正主义者干这一切卑鄙的勾当呢？为什么塔斯社、莫斯科广播电台和苏修报纸向苏联人民只字不提阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府八月二十二日就苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克发表的声明，只字不提谢胡同志在人民议会的讲话和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宣布退出华沙条约，只字不提毛泽东同志和其他中国领导人给霍查和谢胡同志的热情的电报呢？是不是他们认为他们用罗马的一些报纸或其犯罪和造谣诬蔑的同伙们——如雅典的一些卑鄙的校官——的捏造就能够掩盖这些伟大的、具有历史意义的革命行动呢？他们自己可以白日作梦，但却不能一手遮天。
    社论指出，我们知道，在阿尔巴尼亚人民强烈谴责侵略和奴役性的华沙条约以后，苏联沙文主义的修正主义者是不会无所举动的。我们过去和现在都知道，散布反阿尔巴尼亚的诽谤言论是他们反对社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的阴谋和法西斯敌对行动的一个组成部分。然而，经验教训使我们的敌人懂得，阿尔巴尼亚是硬骨头。她不会被人吓倒，她不会屈服，她是不可战胜的。我们从来没有而且也决不会向帝国主义者及其走狗或修正主义者要求援助。我们不招惹任何人，但是谁要是碰一下我们，那么就让他深深地懂得他们是在找死。因为我们有着一切可能、一切力量和手段来进行自卫，取得胜利。
    我们也不是孤立无援的。七亿中国人民的巨大力量站在我们这一边。全世界的革命者是在我们这一边。包括苏联人民在内的全世界的进步人民和我们站在一起。
    让阿尔巴尼亚的敌人去造谣诬蔑吧！让他们去白日作梦吧！他们越是这样就越倒霉。
