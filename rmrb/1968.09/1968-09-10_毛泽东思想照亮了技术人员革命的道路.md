The vinylon industry is still a very young industry in our country. Our factory is also a young factory that has only been in operation for a little over three years. Can a technological revolution be carried out in such a factory? The capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in our factory, following the tune of the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of being a lackey of foreigners, worshipped foreigners as idols and refused to carry out a technological revolution. However, the broad masses of workers and revolutionary technical personnel in our factory did not listen to this. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," and resolved to "grab the tiger by the tail." With the roar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they rose up to overthrow Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory, seized the power of the entire factory, and then, riding on the momentum of victory, carried out a technological revolution. In a short period of time, they frequently reported victories and achieved remarkable results in many aspects.

In our factory's technological revolution, the working class fully played a leading role and the role of the main force. Revolutionary technical personnel, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, also made great contributions. Among them, Chen Zhenglin, a young technical personnel in the vinylon workshop, is a relatively outstanding example.

Taking the First Step to Combine with Workers and Peasants

In 1964, after graduating from university, Chen Zhenglin was assigned to work in our factory. He had studied for more than ten years in school, and the revisionist educational line had a significant impact on him. Was labor for "gold plating" or for learning from workers and reforming one's worldview? In practice, he constantly studied and applied Chairman Mao's teachings on how intellectuals should combine with the workers and peasants, gradually corrected his attitude, and properly handled this issue.

Once, he and the workers in his group found that there was a lot of waste in the packaging materials that did not suit China's reality, and the packaging process could be simplified. Therefore, they decided to innovate. At this time, he heard that the other two groups were also studying this innovation, and his "selfishness" emerged, wanting to take the lead in doing it. The workers in his group discovered this problem in his thinking and severely criticized him, saying, "We are innovating for the revolution, for the pride of the Chinese people, and definitely not for personal fame and gain!" As a result, the comrades from the three groups worked together and completed this innovation excellently in a short time. This incident had a great educational impact on him, making him further understand Chairman Mao's teaching: "Only the working class has the foresight, selflessness, and thoroughness of revolution."

From then on, his awareness of learning from the working class further increased. In labor, he went to the dirtiest and hardest places. When work was busy, he would bring his food to the workshop and eat while working. He also often studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers, constantly exposing his ideological problems and asking the worker comrades for help. The workers praised him, saying, "Although Xiao Chen is thin and weak, he works like a little tiger!"

"The most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." In working with the workers, Chen Zhenglin gradually gained a deep understanding of this truth. In a soft water recovery innovation project, two water pumps needed to be installed. "This is easy!" He did not consult experienced workers and started working. As a result, he failed. From then on, he paid more attention to linking theory with practice, humbly learning from the workers' rich practical experience with the spirit of being a small student. The workers saw this and were pleased, praising him, saying, "Xiao Chen no longer has the airs of a university graduate; he is just like us."

Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Way Forward

In operating with the workers, Chen Zhenglin repeatedly discovered that the set of vinylon equipment imported from abroad had many unreasonable process indicators and designs, often bearing the imprint of the capitalist system and not meeting the needs of our socialist system. Based on Chairman Mao's great teachings on continuously "making discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," he and the workers had several times boldly proposed some important innovation suggestions. However, at that time, the power of the entire factory was in the hands of the capitalist roaders and bourgeois "authorities," and Chen Zhenglin and the workers' suggestions not only did not receive support but were severely criticized. These people said, "We cannot experiment with things that foreigners have not yet tried." As a result, these suggestions were shelved. However, Chen Zhenglin did not lose heart. He and some comrades started to do some small-scale experiments on their own, gradually accumulating experience.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolled forward, and the revolutionary masses in our factory rose up to overthrow a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary "authorities," seizing their power. The working class firmly grasped the reins of power and established a revolutionary committee. We actively carried out a thorough criticism, severely criticizing the revisionist fallacies such as "expert management" and "lackey philosophy" advocated by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory, and also severely criticizing bourgeois ideas of fame and gain. We quickly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Chen Zhenglin actively participated in the thorough criticism, receiving profound education and great encouragement. He and the workers together proposed the technological revolution suggestion on hot rolling that had been suppressed by the capitalist roaders for more than two years, determined to break the foreign dogmas, forge our own path, and scale new heights in vinylon production science and technology, to make Chairman Mao proud and to bring glory to the Chinese people. With the help of the PLA stationed in the factory, the revolutionary committee strongly supported Chen Zhenglin and the workers' suggestions and quickly organized a technological revolution team composed of revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres to immediately join the battle.

The technological revolution in hot rolling that Chen Zhenglin participated in has great significance for the development of vinylon production. If successful, it can not only achieve a significant increase in production but also greatly reduce production costs, improve product quality, reduce labor intensity for workers, and simplify equipment. In this technological revolution, Chen Zhenglin learned the selfless and excellent qualities of the working class who dedicate themselves to the revolution. He actively and enthusiastically introduced the great significance of this technological revolution to the workers, introduced the situation and experiences of the preliminary experiments in the laboratory, proposed ideas for further experiments, and mobilized everyone to actively come up with ideas and solutions, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the worker comrades. During the experiments, the worker comrades in the group took the lead in taking on heavy tasks, treating the experimental site as a battlefield against imperialism and revisionism. They carried forward the revolutionary tradition of the People's Liberation Army of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting, often working the early shift and then the middle shift, persisting in fighting on the front lines. Chen Zhenglin also took the workers as his example and merged with them. The workers said, "We sweat as much as Xiao Chen does. He is doing technological revolution with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, not for fame or gain, but wholeheartedly for socialism. Such a technical personnel, we trust."

During the experiment, they encountered some unexpected difficulties and problems. Once, the results of the experiment were the opposite of the initial estimates. What to do? Chen Zhenglin and the worker comrades studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Practice" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" Together, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their way forward. They did not lose heart or be discouraged but timely analyzed and studied the results of practice, drawing lessons from experience. After repeated battles, they finally achieved victory in this technologically significant revolution.

Now, Chen Zhenglin and the worker comrades are fighting together to further perfect the results of this technological revolution while enthusiastically participating in another new technological revolution with full political enthusiasm, contributing their strength to achieve new victories.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The reason why Chen Zhenglin could make some contributions in the technological revolution is precisely the result of being nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought. Chen Zhenglin deeply felt, "Following Chairman Mao's instructions, insisting on combining with the worker masses, and resolutely taking the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory to reform one's worldview, one can make contributions to the people and create miracles with the worker comrades. Otherwise, one can only go down a dead-end street and end up achieving nothing."

    毛泽东思想照亮了技术人员革命的道路
    本报通讯员
    维尼纶工业在我国还是一种很年青的工业。我们这个厂也是一个仅仅投产三年多的年青的工厂。在这样的工厂里，能够大搞技术革命吗？我厂的走资派及资产阶级反动技术“权威”，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的洋奴哲学的调子，捧出洋人作偶像，硬是不准搞技术革命。然而，我厂广大工人群众和革命的技术人员就不听这一套，他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，立志要摸老虎屁股。无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，他们起来大造中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂代理人的反，夺回了全厂大权，并且乘胜前进，大搞技术革命，在短短的时间里就捷报频传，在许多方面都取得了显著成就。
    在我厂技术革命中，工人阶级充分发挥了领导作用和主力军的作用，革命的技术人员也在毛泽东思想指引下，作出了很大的贡献。其中，维尼纶车间青年技术人员陈正纶同志就是比较突出的一个。
    迈出了和工农结合的第一步
    一九六四年陈正纶同志大学毕业，分配到我厂劳动。他在学校读了十多年的书，修正主义的教育路线在他身上也有着不小的影响。劳动，是为了“镀金”，还是为了向工人学习，改造自己的世界观。他在实践中，不断活学活用毛主席关于知识分子要和工农群众结合的教导，逐渐端正了态度，正确处理了这个问题。
    一次，他和同组的工人在打包劳动中，都感到包装材料有不少不切合我国实际的浪费，并且，打包过程还可以简化，因此，他们决定进行革新。这时，他听到其他两个小组的同志们也在研究这项革新，他的“私”字就冒了出来，想抢先来搞。同组的工人们发现他这个思想问题，就严肃地批评了他，语重心长地对他讲：“咱们搞革新是为了革命，为了给中国人民争气，可决不能为了个人名利啊！”结果，三个小组的同志齐心协力，在很短的时间内就出色地完成了这项革新。这件事对他的教育很大，使他进一步懂得了毛主席所教导的：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”
    从此，他向工人阶级学习的自觉性进一步提高了。在劳动中，那里最脏最累，他就到那里去干，工作忙时就把饭带到车间，边吃边干。他还经常同工人们一起学习毛主席著作，不断亮出自己的思想问题，请工人同志们帮助。工人们赞扬说：“别看小陈身体又瘦又弱，干起活来可象个小老虎！”
    “最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”在同工人一起劳动中，陈正纶对这个真理也逐步有了深切体会。在一项软水回收的革新项目中，需要安装两台水泵。“这还不容易！”他没有请教有经验的工人就干起来。结果，干糟了。从此，他更加注意理论联系实际，以甘当小学生的精神，虚心学习工人们丰富的实践经验。工人们看在眼里，喜在心里，夸奖他说：“小陈没有大学生的架子了，跟咱们一样。”
    毛泽东思想照亮了前进的方向
    陈正纶在和工人们一起操作中，不断发现从外国进口的这套维尼纶设备，有不少工艺指标和工艺设计是不合理的，并且往往带有资本主义制度的烙印，不符合我们社会主义制度的需要。根据毛主席关于要不断“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的伟大教导，他和工人们曾几次大胆提出过某些重要的革新建议。但是，由于当时全厂的大权操纵在走资派和资产阶级“权威”的手里，陈正纶和工人们的建议不但得不到支持，反而受到严厉的批评，这些家伙说什么“外国人还没有试验的我们不能试验”。结果这些建议竟被打入冷宫。然而，陈正纶并没有灰心，他和一些同志一道，自己动手，开始搞一些小型试验，逐步摸索和积累经验。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，我厂无产阶级革命派奋起造了一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的反，夺了他们的权，工人阶级牢牢掌握了印把子，建立了革命委员会。我们积极开展了革命的大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人鼓吹的“专家治厂”、“洋奴哲学”等反革命修正主义谬论，并且狠批了资产阶级名利思想，迅速落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。陈正纶积极投入了革命大批判，既受到很深刻的教育，也受到很大的鼓舞。他和工人们一起又提出了被走资派压制了两年多的关于热卷缩的技术革命建议，决心大破洋教条，走自己的路，攀登维尼纶生产中新的科学技术高峰，为毛主席争气，为中国人民争光。在驻厂解放军的帮助下，厂革委会大力支持了陈正纶和工人们的建议，并迅速组织了由革命工人、革命技术人员和革命干部参加的技术革命小组，立即投入了战斗。
    陈正纶参加的这项热卷缩的技术革命，对于维尼纶生产的发展，有着重大的意义。搞成功了，不仅可以实现大幅度的增产，并且可以大大降低生产成本，提高产品质量，减轻工人劳动强度，同时又可简化设备。陈正纶在这项技术革命中，学习了工人阶级一心为革命的大公无私的优秀品质，主动地热情地向工人们介绍了这项技术革命的重大意义，介绍了在实验室初步试验的情况和体会，提出进一步搞试验的设想，并发动大家积极出主意想办法，大大调动了工人同志的积极性。在试验中，组里的工人同志们，抢着挑重担子，把试验场地当作反帝、反修的战场，他们发扬人民解放军的不怕疲劳，连续作战的革命传统，往往上了早班，又上中班，坚持战斗在第一线。陈正纶也以工人为榜样，和工人融合在一起。工人们说：“我们流多少汗，小陈也流多少汗。他搞技术革命，对毛主席心怀一个‘忠’字，不为名，不为利，一心为了社会主义。这样的技术员，我们信得过。”
    试验进行中遇到了一些未曾料到的困难和问题。有一次，试验中出现的结果同事先估计的恰恰相反。怎么办？陈正纶和工人同志们一起学习了毛主席的《实践论》和《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等光辉著作。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，照亮了他们前进的方向。他们毫不灰心丧气，及时地对实践的结果进行分析研究，汲取经验教训。经过反复的战斗，终于夺取了这项具有重大意义的技术革命的胜利。
    现在，陈正纶和工人同志们一起，一面为进一步完善这项技术革命的成果而战斗，一面又以饱满的政治热情，投入了另一项新的技术革命中，为夺取新的胜利贡献力量。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”陈正纶同志所以能够在技术革命中作出一定的贡献，正是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。陈正纶同志深有体会地说：“照毛主席的指示办事，坚持同工人群众相结合，坚决走上海机床厂的道路，改造世界观，就能够为人民做出贡献，就可以和工人同志一道创造奇迹。反之，就只能走进死胡同，到头来一事无成。”
