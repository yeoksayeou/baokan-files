A notable issue of the revolutionary big criticism column was posted on the wall of the dining hall at Zhangjiakou Second Middle School. This issue attracted the attention of the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, who unanimously praised it as a powerful and excellent column. It struck at the heart of the revisionist educational line and hit the sore spot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

Originally, this issue was the first time the school's logistics group workers, with the help of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the school, launched an attack on the revisionist educational line with revolutionary pens. In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the school faithfully executed the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, completely disregarding the school's workers, and suppressing the workers' revolutionary spirit in every way. They did not allow the workers to participate in the school's educational work. During the current vigorous struggle, criticism, and reform movement, the workers had long wanted to engage in revolutionary big criticism, but some were concerned about their low cultural level, fearing they could not speak or write well, and thus had not taken action. The propaganda team members learned of this situation and immediately helped them organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying together Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "implementing the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the working masses." This helped them understand the profound significance of the educational revolution and realize that not actively participating in the educational revolution meant not caring about state affairs and being disloyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said: In the past, we watched as the old school trained students who could not serve the workers and peasants, and some became "spiritual aristocrats" who could neither carry nor lift. We were very angry. But at that time, who in the school had the right to speak for the workers! Today, Chairman Mao trusts us and regards us as a force in the educational revolution. We must make Chairman Mao proud! We must overcome our inferiority complex, step onto the stage of the educational revolution, and achieve new merits for the people in the educational revolution.

Chairman Mao's workers are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. With the enthusiastic help of the workers' propaganda team, they said, "Let's do it!" and immediately launched various forms of revolutionary big criticism activities, becoming a vital force in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

Boiler worker Sun Yueqing is an illiterate who could barely recognize a few characters and had always been quiet, never daring to speak up or take the lead. Now he understands the principle that not caring about state affairs will make one a confused person, so he took action. He heard that the logistics group was also going to publish a revolutionary big criticism column and immediately asked someone to write a criticism article for him, expressing all the words he had wanted to say but couldn't over the years. He deeply exposed the heinous crimes of the revisionist educational line.

    一期引人注目的大批判专栏
    一天，在张家口第二中学饭厅的墙上，贴出了一期革命大批判专栏。这期专栏引起了全校革命师生的注意，大家看了，同声称赞是一期有战斗性的好专栏。它打中了修正主义教育路线的要害，刺到了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的疼处。
    原来，这期专栏是学校后勤组的工人们在驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，第一次用革命的笔向修正主义教育路线展开的冲锋。过去，学校的一小撮走资派忠实地执行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，根本不把学校的工人放在眼里，对于工人们的革命精神百般地进行压制，更不让他们过问学校的教育工作。在当前轰轰烈烈的斗、批、改运动中，工人们早就有进行革命大批判的愿望，但是有些人顾虑到自己的文化水平低，怕说不好，写不好，所以一直没有行动起来。工人宣传队的同志们了解到这种情况，立即帮助他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，和他们一起学习了毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示，使他们认识到教育革命的深远意义，认识到不积极起来参加教育革命，就是不关心国家大事，就是对毛主席革命路线的不忠。他们说：过去我们眼看着旧学校培养的学生不能为工农兵服务，有些成了肩不能挑、手不能提的“精神贵族”，非常气愤。但是，那时候学校中哪有我们工人的发言权！今天，毛主席他老人家信任我们，把我们看作教育革命的一份力量，我们一定要为毛主席争气！要打掉自卑感，登上教育革命的舞台，在教育革命中为人民立新功。
    毛主席的工人最忠于毛主席。在工人宣传队热情帮助下，他们说干就干，立即展开了各种形式的革命大批判活动，成了学校斗、批、改中的一支有生力量。
    茶炉工孙跃庭是个斗大的字不识几个的大老粗，过去连话都很少说，出头露面的事更轮不上他。现在他认识到不关心国家大事，就会变成糊涂人的道理，便积极地行动起来。他听说后勤组也要出革命大批判专栏，便立即请人代笔写了一份批判稿，把他自己几十年要说而未能说出的话都写了出来，深刻地揭露了修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行。   四一五报道组
