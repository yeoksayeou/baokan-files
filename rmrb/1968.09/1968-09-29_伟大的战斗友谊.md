“Within the country, there are friends; at the ends of the earth, it is as if we are neighbors.” At a time when the people of our country are brimming with confidence as they strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are enthusiastically celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, a delegation from the Albanian Party and Government, led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People’s Republic of Albania, and Minister of Defense, has arrived in our country on a friendly visit at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People’s Republic of China. This is a great support and encouragement from the great leader of the Albanian people, the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the Albanian Labor Party and people. We welcome the envoys of the heroic people from the front lines of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle with the most sincere and enthusiastic greetings and pay them the highest revolutionary salute!

The heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, have achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction and made outstanding contributions to the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. The Chinese people are proud to have such brothers and comrades-in-arms.

The Albanian Labor Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to its own revolutionary practice, launched a vigorous revolutionary movement, promoted the ideological transformation of the people, and accelerated economic construction, creating a vibrant revolutionary scene throughout the country. Comrade Enver Hoxha’s important report on educational revolution and proletarian supervision in the first half of this year has greatly advanced the revolutionary movement. The revolutionary movement in Albania not only consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat in Albania but also enriches the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship internationally. Today, the people’s Albania is stronger than ever. This great socialist beacon in Europe shines ever more brightly.

The Albanian Labor Party and people have consistently and resolutely opposed imperialism led by the United States and firmly supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. The Albanian people, who uphold proletarian internationalism, are reliable and trustworthy friends of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Albanian Labor Party and people have consistently held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and engaged in an unyielding struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. They uphold the truth, uphold principles, fear neither violence nor difficulties, dare to stand against the evil winds and waves, and stand firmly on the European continent. Recently, Albania resolutely announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, which is controlled by the Soviet revisionists, is aggressive, and anti-socialist. This revolutionary action has dealt a heavy blow to Soviet social-imperialism and has been warmly praised and supported by the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Albanian Labor Party is truly a great Marxist-Leninist party. The Albanian people are truly heroic. The People’s Republic of Albania is truly a strong socialist red fortress standing in Europe.

Recently, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has intensified its social-imperialist policy of aggression in Eastern Europe. After dispatching more than 600,000 troops to invade Czechoslovakia, it has now concentrated a large number of troops in Bulgaria, threatening the peace and security of the Balkan region. It is particularly noteworthy that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has recently intensified its political attacks and military threats against the People’s Republic of Albania. However, the heroic Albanian people are not intimidated. In the past, they have repeatedly foiled the subversive and sabotage plots of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and its accomplices. Today, they are more than ever on high alert and ready to strike back at any invaders of Albania.

The two parties, two peoples, and two armies of China and Albania are the closest comrades-in-arms. The friendship between our two peoples is personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and is based on Marxism-Leninism. Our two parties, two peoples, and two armies most resolutely defend Marxism-Leninism, most resolutely oppose imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and the reactionaries of all countries, most resolutely uphold the principles of proletarian internationalism, and most resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Our common revolutionary goals and lofty revolutionary ideals bind our two peoples closely together. Such a friendship is the greatest friendship in the world.

Chairman Mao said: “The two parties, two peoples, and two armies of China and Albania have forged a deep revolutionary friendship in the course of the socialist revolution and socialist construction and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.” “Let us together hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and, with all Marxist-Leninists, all oppressed peoples, and oppressed nations in the world, resolutely carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and the proletarian revolutionary cause through to the end.”

Comrade Enver Hoxha said: “Our people, party, and government will advance together with the great Chinese people and the Communist Party of China on the common revolutionary road, and in times of peace and in times of storm, will always stand shoulder to shoulder with them, advancing together in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and for the victory of revolution and socialism.”

The peoples of China and Albania are bound by blood and share a common destiny. The combat friendship between the two parties, two peoples, and two armies of China and Albania is eternal and unbreakable. Recently, the telegrams of congratulations from Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou Enlai, and the reply telegrams from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, have pushed the revolutionary combat friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania to a new height. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggles of the Albanian people as their own struggles and the victories of the Albanian people as their own victories. No matter what storms and waves arise in the world, the Chinese people will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the Albanian people and advance together. If imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries dare to touch socialist Albania, they will surely suffer a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable defeat.

The visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku to our country will further strengthen the close friendship and combat unity between the two parties, two peoples, and two armies of China and Albania and make new contributions to our common cause. The two parties, two peoples, and two armies of China and Albania will forever stand together, fight together, and win together under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism!

    伟大的战斗友谊
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论
    “海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。正当我国人民意气风发地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，热烈欢庆中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，应中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府的邀请，来到我国进行友好访问。这是以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的极大支持，极大鼓舞。我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，对来自反帝反修前线的英雄人民的使节，表示最诚挚、最热烈的欢迎，并致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，取得了光辉的成就；在反帝反修斗争中，作出了杰出的贡献。中国人民为有这样的兄弟和战友而感到自豪。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于本国的革命实践，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了经济建设的迅速发展，全国出现一片朝气蓬勃的革命景象。恩维尔·霍查同志今年上半年所作的教育革命和工人阶级监督的重要报告，把革命化运动大大地推进了一步。阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，不仅巩固了阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政，而且丰富了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验。今天，人民的阿尔巴尼亚更加坚强了。这盏欧洲的伟大社会主义明灯放射出越来越灿烂的光芒。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。坚持无产阶级国际主义的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是全世界革命人民忠实的、可靠的朋友。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，同以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义进行针锋相对、毫不妥协的斗争。他们坚持真理，坚持原则，不怕强暴，不怕困难，敢于顶住妖风逆浪，岿然屹立在欧洲大陆上。最近，阿尔巴尼亚毅然宣布退出苏修一手控制的、侵略性的、反社会主义的华沙条约。这一革命行动，给了苏修社会帝国主义以沉重的打击，受到了全世界革命人民的热烈赞扬和支持。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不愧是伟大的马克思列宁主义政党。阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧是顶天立地的英雄人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国不愧是屹立在欧洲的坚强的社会主义的红色堡垒。
    近来，苏修叛徒集团变本加厉地在东欧推行社会帝国主义的侵略政策。它在出动六十多万军队侵占捷克斯洛伐克之后，又在保加利亚集结大量军队，威胁着巴尔干地区的和平和安全。特别值得注意的是，苏修叛徒集团最近加紧了对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的政治攻击和军事威胁。但是，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是吓不倒的。过去他们曾经一次又一次粉碎了苏修叛徒集团及其同伙的颠覆破坏阴谋，今天他们正百倍提高革命警惕，随时准备痛击胆敢进犯阿尔巴尼亚的侵略者。
    中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队是最亲密的战友。我们两国人民的友谊，是中国人民伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上的。我们两党、两国人民和两国军队最坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义，最坚决地反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派，最坚决地奉行无产阶级国际主义原则，最坚决地把社会主义革命进行到底。共同的革命目标和崇高的革命理想，使我们两国人民紧密地连结起来。这样的友谊，是世界上最伟大的友谊。
    毛主席说：“中阿两党、两国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的革命友谊。”“让我们共同高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，同全世界一切马克思列宁主义者、一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族一起，把反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争，把无产阶级革命事业，坚决进行到底。”
    恩维尔·霍查同志说：“我国人民、我们党和政府同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党在共同的革命道路上前进，无论在和平的日子里，还是在暴风雨的时刻，都将永远同他们肩并肩地站在一起，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、争取革命和社会主义胜利的斗争中共同前进。”
    中阿两国人民血肉相连，休戚相关。中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队的战斗友谊，是永恒的，牢不可破的。最近，恩维尔·霍查同志和穆罕默德·谢胡同志给毛主席、林副主席和周恩来总理的贺电，毛主席、林副主席和周总理的复电，把中阿两党和两国人民的革命的战斗的友谊，推到了一个新的高峰。中国人民一向把阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争看作自己的斗争，把阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利看作自己的胜利。不管世界上发生什么样的惊涛骇浪，中国人民永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民并肩战斗，共同前进。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，如果胆敢碰一下社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，必将碰得头破血流，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团这次到我国访问，必将进一步加强中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队的亲密友谊和战斗团结，对我们的共同事业作出新的贡献。中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队，在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
