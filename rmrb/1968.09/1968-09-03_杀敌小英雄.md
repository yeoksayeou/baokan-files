The sun had set, and the farmers of the liberated area of Xianglin in Thua Thien Province had finished a day of hard work and returned home. The fields were empty except for the ten-year-old cowherd Ah Wei, who was slowly leading his cows back to the village. Suddenly, the sound of roaring engines filled the air, and seven helicopters sneaked in. Ah Wei knew that these helicopters carried enemy special forces, who would plant landmines in the fields after the farmers had gone home, harming the people.

The enemy helicopters hovered over the cornfields, trying to land near Ah Wei. Ah Wei panicked, thinking that if he went back to report to the guerrilla uncles, it would be too late.

"Take them down!" Ah Wei clenched his fists, making up his mind. He tightly gripped the rifle given to him by the guerrilla uncles, ran to a nearby anti-aircraft position, and calmly watched the enemy helicopters.

One helicopter landed about ten meters away from Ah Wei's fighting position. As soon as a few enemy soldiers poked their heads out of the window, Ah Wei's bullets of hatred struck the enemy helicopter, setting it on fire instantly. The ammunition inside the helicopter exploded one after another. The other six enemy helicopters, seeing the situation, fled in panic.

After a while, Ah Wei jumped out of the fighting position and quickly ran to the wreckage of the downed enemy helicopter. He saw that all the weapons on the plane had been destroyed, leaving only an ammunition box with 200 rounds. Ah Wei happily carried it back to the village and handed it over to the guerrilla uncles.

Everyone praised, "Ah Wei is indeed a remarkable little hero. He hit the mark and fought fiercely on his first attempt to shoot down a helicopter."

	The Clever Little Courier

This time, the little courier Ak led several cadres through a mountainous and forested area. Ak, like an agile little squirrel, traversed the old forests of western Thua Thien. She was familiar with every mountain, river, and tree. She remembered the depth of every river and the location of every giant tree by the roadside.

"Uncles, we're about to cross the river!" Ak turned her head and said to the cadres following behind. Then she herself waded across the river first. Suddenly, she spotted a group of puppet soldiers, about thirty or forty, on the opposite bank. At the same time, the puppet soldiers also spotted Ak.

Ak had an idea: "I must protect the uncles!" She shouted and dived into the water, swimming back.

The cadres heard Ak's signal of enemy presence and quickly hid, preparing to deal with the enemy. The puppet soldiers, seeing Ak dive into the water, shouted madly, "It's a girl, we want her alive."

Ak was exhausted when she reached the shore, but her heart was filled with hatred for the enemy. She thought, "Even if I die, I will not let the enemy go back alive." She quickly ran towards the traps set by the guerrillas. At this moment, the puppet soldiers had crossed the river. Suddenly, there were several piercing screams. The five puppet soldiers in the lead fell into the traps, one died on the spot, and four were seriously injured. The rest of the puppet soldiers were so frightened that they turned around and fled.

Ak often led the guerrillas in clever and brave attacks on the enemy.

    杀敌小英雄
    勇敢的放牛娃
    太阳下山了，承天省香林解放区的农民，经过一天辛勤的劳动，都已收工回家。田野上只剩下十岁的放牛娃阿威，他正赶着牛向村庄慢慢走去。忽然，空中传来了隆隆的马达声，只见七架直升飞机偷偷摸摸地飞来了。阿威知道，这些飞机里载的是敌人的别动队，他们是专门乘着农民回家以后，在田地里埋设地雷，残害人民的。
    敌机在玉米地上空鬼鬼祟祟地盘旋着，企图在阿威附近着陆。阿威急了，他想，回去报告游击队的叔叔们，那就太晚了。
      “干掉他们！”阿威握紧了拳头，下定了决心。他紧握着游击队叔叔们交给他的一支步枪，跑到附近打飞机的工事中，沉着地注视着敌机。
    一架直升飞机在离阿威战斗工事十米的平地上降落了，几个敌人刚刚把头露出机窗，阿威射出的仇恨的子弹，打中了这架敌机，使它立刻起火燃烧，飞机中的弹药也接连爆炸开了。另外六架敌机见势不妙，慌慌张张地争相逃命。
    过了一会，阿威跳出战斗工事，迅速地跑到被击落的敌机残骸旁边，他看到飞机上的武器都已炸坏了，只剩下一个有两百发子弹的弹药箱。阿威高高兴兴地把它背回村子里，交给了游击队的叔叔们。
    人们都夸奖说：“阿威真是个了不起的小英雄。第一次打飞机就打得准，打得狠。”
        机智的小交通员
    这一回，小交通员阿克又带领着几个干部跋山涉水，穿过一个地形复杂的山林。阿克如同一只活泼机灵的小松鼠，跑遍了承天西部的老森林，她熟悉这里的一山一水，一草一木，她牢记着每一条河的深度，路旁每一棵巨大的树木的位置。
    “叔叔们，就要过河了！”阿克转过头来，对着走在后面的干部们说，然后自己先涉水过河。突然，她发现对岸出现一群伪军，大约三四十人。这时，伪军也已发现了阿克。
    阿克脑子里闪过了一个念头：“我一定要保护叔叔们！”只听见她大喊一声，便潜下水往回游去。
    干部们听到阿克报告有敌情的暗号，就迅速地隐蔽起来，准备对付敌人。这时，伪军看见阿克潜下水以后，就疯狂地大叫：“这是一个女孩子，要捉活的。”
    阿克游上岸时，虽然很累，但是，她心头充满着对敌人的仇恨，她想：“我就是死了，也决不让敌人全部活着回去。”她飞快地往游击队设下的陷阱群方向跑去。这时候，伪军已游过河，只听见几声凄厉的狂叫，跑在前头的五名伪军跌进陷阱，其中一名当场死去，四名受了重伤，其余伪军见了，都吓得目瞪口呆，掉转头夹着尾巴拚命逃跑了。
    阿克还常常机智、勇敢地带领游击队去袭击敌人。
