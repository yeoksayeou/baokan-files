	Revolutionary workers of Beijing Second Rolling Mill bravely shoulder responsibilities and pledge to be the backbone of the workers' propaganda team
	Beijing Second Rolling Mill achieves double victory in revolution and production

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 11, the revolutionary workers of Beijing Second Rolling Mill have carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. While sending worker representatives to participate in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in the capital, they have pushed the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own factory to a new high, achieving double victories in revolution and production. In August, the number of workers in this factory decreased by 9%, but the production tasks were completed four days ahead of schedule. The steel output increased by 48% compared to July, and the total output value increased by 35%. At the beginning of September, the factory also successfully trial-produced two important new products: shaped spring flat steel and cold-bent channel steel.

	The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletariat being the leading class, as well as Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's warm reception of the representatives of the proletariat in the capital, greatly inspired all the revolutionary workers in the factory. The factory immediately held a Mao Zedong Thought study class centered on implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. Revolutionary workers in the study class deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, in light of these instructions, found their own shortcomings. On the basis of raising their proletarian consciousness, they formulated specific measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through the study in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, workers further aroused their sense of responsibility and pride as members of the proletariat. They expressed their determination to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the factory, to grasp the revolution, and to promote production, becoming the strong backbone of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. The entire factory carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, mainly at the team level, launching relentless attacks on a handful of class enemies, exposing those who were more deeply hidden. In conjunction with the revolutionary criticism and the cleanup of class ranks, the work of rectification and streamlining of the organization was carried out, and the entire factory presented a scene of revolutionary fervor.

	Chairman Mao's latest instructions have given revolutionary workers boundless strength. The workers of this factory, despite having fewer people and heavier tasks, bravely shouldered the responsibilities, carried out technological innovations, and tapped into potential, making production thrive. The production of flat steel and strip steel in the second workshop increased by 76% in August compared to July. The workers proudly said, "No matter how heavy the tasks are, they cannot defeat the proletariat; no matter how great the difficulties are, we will trample them underfoot." While completing the production tasks ahead of schedule, they also successfully trial-produced an important new product—shaped spring flat steel. This special steel is a key material for large trucks. In the past, it was imported from a revisionist country, but this revisionist country deliberately created obstacles and stopped the supply. The blockade cannot stop the great Chinese proletariat. During the trial production process, the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand on our own feet among the nations of the world." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought enabled them to overcome one difficulty after another, achieve six technological innovations, and finally produce the first batch of high-quality shaped spring flat steel in a month. The workers called it "Anti-Revisionism No. 1," saying that the success of "Anti-Revisionism No. 1" gave modern revisionism a resounding slap in the face. The workers in the third workshop, in the process of producing round steel, achieved a major technological innovation—"double-slot steel entry"—after which the production efficiency increased by more than 30%.

    广大革命工人勇挑重担　誓做工人宣传队的后盾
    北京第二轧钢厂夺得革命生产双胜利
    据新华社十一日讯　北京第二轧钢厂广大革命工人发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，在派出工人代表参加首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同时，把本厂的斗、批、改推向新的高潮，夺得了革命、生产双胜利。八月份，这个厂的人员减少百分之九，生产任务却提前四天完成，钢材产量比七月份增长百分之四十八，总产值提高了百分之三十五。九月初，这个厂还试制成功了异形弹簧扁钢和冷弯槽钢两种重要新产品。
    毛主席关于工人阶级是领导阶级的最新指示的发表，以及毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切接见首都工人阶级代表，极大地鼓舞了全厂广大革命职工。厂里立即举办了以落实毛主席一系列最新指示为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命职工在学习班上深入学习毛主席的最新指示，并且对照毛主席最新指示，寻找自己的差距，又在提高无产阶级觉悟的基础上，订出落实毛主席最新指示的具体措施。工人们通过在毛泽东思想学习班的学习，进一步激发了自己作为工人阶级一员的责任感和自豪感，他们表示一定要认真搞好工厂的斗、批、改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，做工人毛泽东思想宣传队的坚强后盾。全厂深入持久地开展以班组为主的革命大批判，不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏得更深的阶级敌人。结合革命大批判和清理阶级队伍，开展了整党和精简机构的工作，全厂呈现出一派热气腾腾的革命景象。
    毛主席的最新指示，给革命职工增添了无穷的力量。这个厂的广大工人在人少任务重的情况下，勇挑重担，大搞技术革新，大挖潜力，使生产蒸蒸日上。生产扁钢和带钢的二车间八月份生产任务比七月份增长百分之七十六，工人们豪迈地说：“任务再重也难不倒我们工人阶级，困难再大也要把它踩在脚下。”他们在超额完成生产任务的同时，还试制成功了一种重要的新产品——异形弹簧扁钢。这种特殊钢材是用于大型载重汽车的关键材料，过去从一个修正主义国家进口，可是这个修正主义国家却有意刁难，中止了供应。封锁难不倒伟大的中国工人阶级，工人们在试制过程中反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使他们战胜了一个个的困难，实现了六项技术革新，终于在一个月的时间里，试制出了第一批优质的异形弹簧扁钢。工人们把它称作“反修一号”，他们说，“反修一号”的试制成功，给了现代修正主义一记响亮的耳光。三车间的工人们在圆钢的生产过程中，实现了一项重大技术革新——“双槽进钢”以后，使生产效率提高百分之三十以上。
