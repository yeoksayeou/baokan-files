Mozambique National Armed Forces Launch Heavy Bombardment on Colonial Military Base

In a single strike, they destroyed twelve Portuguese colonialist planes

Mozambique National Armed Forces engage in ten battles in Northeast regions in June and July, annihilating over a hundred enemies

New China News Agency, Dar es Salaam, September 5 - The Mozambique National Armed Forces launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the Portuguese airbase in Mueda, Delagoa Bay Province, on August 10, destroying twelve enemy planes and achieving a brilliant victory.

According to a communique issued by the Mozambique National Armed Forces on September 5, the guerrillas bombarded the Portuguese airbase in Mueda with mortars and artillery at around 5:30 AM on August 10. Of the thirteen enemy planes stationed at the base, twelve were destroyed. The base's fuel depot and several military vehicles were also destroyed. The Mueda airbase was engulfed in flames all day.

It is reported that in areas under the control of the Mozambique National Armed Forces, such as Delagoa Bay, the Portuguese colonial forces, besieged in various strongholds, have built and fortified military airfields. The Mueda airbase is the main Portuguese airbase in Delagoa Bay Province. The Portuguese colonial forces, using a batch of bombers provided by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, frequently take off from this base to bomb villages in Delagoa Bay Province, dropping napalm bombs to kill farmers and destroy crops.

It is reported that the Mozambique National Armed Forces launched nearly ten attacks on this major enemy stronghold in Mueda in November last year, shooting down one enemy plane and killing over fifty colonial soldiers.

New China News Agency, Dar es Salaam, September 6 - According to a battle report issued by the Mozambique National Armed Forces on August 30, the Mozambique National Armed Forces engaged in ten battles in the Northeast Delagoa Bay Province and North Niassa Province in June and July, annihilating over a hundred Portuguese colonial soldiers, destroying one bridge, and destroying six military vehicles.

In Delagoa Bay Province, the guerrillas attacked the Portuguese strategic village of Namwande on June 30. The enemy fled in disarray, and the guerrillas rescued the residents held in the military camp.

On July 13, the guerrillas attacked and occupied the military stronghold of Lucia in the Guitarlayo region, killing seventeen enemy soldiers and seizing many weapons and other military supplies.

On July 22, the guerrillas laid landmines on the public road between Nangololo and Muideumba in the main area of Kavanaga, killing eight enemy soldiers and injuring many others. On July 25, another batch of enemy soldiers came out from Nangololo on patrol and stepped on the landmines, resulting in five deaths.

In the eastern part of Niassa Province, the guerrillas destroyed three trucks and annihilated about twenty Portuguese colonial soldiers in a landmine battle in the Luatize region at the end of May.

In four days from June 6 to June 18, the guerrillas launched a series of ambushes against the Portuguese colonial forces in various regions, killing and injuring a large number of enemy soldiers. From June 15 to June 19, the landmines laid by the guerrillas destroyed two military vehicles and killed about ten enemy soldiers. Subsequently, the guerrillas quickly and cleverly laid landmines around the destroyed vehicles. When the enemy came to attempt to tow away the two vehicles, they stepped on the landmines.
