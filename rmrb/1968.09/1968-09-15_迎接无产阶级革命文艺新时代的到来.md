The great changes brought about by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are now manifesting in every aspect. At this crucial moment when we are on the verge of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, two magnificent works of art have bloomed side by side: the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern." They shine brilliantly!

The blossoming of these two new flowers of proletarian art is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on art! It is a joyful harvest of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! It is another outstanding contribution by Comrade Jiang Qing!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the overall revolutionary struggle." Art revolution has always been an important component of political revolution, and this is especially true in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is unprecedented in its greatness and depth. Therefore, the birth of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" is not just a major event in the art world; it is also a major event in the entire cause of the proletarian socialist revolution.

	Great Era, Great Art

Art, ultimately, is dominated by politics and serves politics. A great era produces great art. The unprecedentedly great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will undoubtedly produce unprecedentedly great revolutionary art.

A truly great work of art must reflect the most significant themes and most important subjects of the contemporary era. The theme or subject has always been a major political issue, a major issue in the realm of ideology where one class exercises hegemony or dictatorship over another. The art of any class, whether music or fine arts, always chooses subjects that are most meaningful to its own class to create works that best serve its class. In the case of bourgeois art, the subjects of the so-called Renaissance period were all drawn from religion and mythology, or from lords and noblewomen, in short, they only sang the praises of the rulers of "heaven" or the earth, never the laboring people. As for the subjects of modern bourgeois painting, they are even more decadent and corrupt, either nude women or bathing women, or a pile of incomprehensible junk, to satisfy the bourgeois masters' pursuit of sensory stimulation after a feast of wine and food. If we say that the bourgeoisie, in its ascendant period, produced some works based on the myths and legends of Greece and Rome, depicting heroic deeds and self-sacrifice, to cover up its sordid motives of pursuing profit, then now, this class has completely declined, it no longer needs a hypocritical mask to cover up, but openly reveals its greedy, shameless, debauched, and cruel nature of eating people. In the hands of the bourgeoisie, once they became the ruling class, their brushes and piano keys, like the courts and prisons they control, are tools used to exercise dictatorship over the proletariat in different realms.

	“History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is detached from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by the masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies.” For thousands of years, the literary and artistic history of the exploiting classes has been a perverted history of crimes!

The proletariat has taken the political stage to overturn this old case!

Over the past hundred years, from the Paris Commune to the October Revolution, to the 1949 Chinese Revolution, the proletariat has produced some artistic works reflecting its struggles in the vast and magnificent revolutionary struggles. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on art, the Chinese opera revolution has raised the proletarian art revolution to an unprecedented height. In this great revolution, steadfast proletarian revolutionaries, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led the broad masses of revolutionary artists to brave the currents, battle the waves, hack through thorns, and break through the encirclement, consecutively capturing the strongholds of opera, ballet, symphony, and piano, oil painting, etc. Thus, the workers, peasants, and soldiers truly "marched" onto the art stage, throwing the dead foreigners who had occupied the art stage for thousands of years into the garbage bin of history, and the history that had been perverted by the exploiting classes was overturned again.

The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" have caused such a strong response among hundreds of millions of revolutionary people precisely because they perfectly embody the great theme of determining the fate of China and humanity, deeply expressing the revolutionary ideals and political aspirations of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding representative of the proletariat and revolutionary people. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" depicts our great leader Mao, after personally founding the great Chinese Communist Party, carrying the hopes of the Chinese people, with a grand plan to transform the world, traversing mountains and rivers, personally going to Anshan, an important mining area in China at that time, sowing the seeds of revolution, opening up the path to victory, and solving the most important and complex issue of the contemporary era: how the Chinese people can seize political power through armed struggle. The piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" portrays the towering heroic image of the Li Yuhe family, which is the embodiment of the countless heroes who have undergone the longest, most intense, most arduous, and most complex revolutionary struggles in the history of the world proletarian revolution, and is a high summary of the excellent qualities and sublime spiritual realm of the advanced representatives of the Chinese proletariat nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. These two proletarian art treasures reflecting the most significant themes of the contemporary era are a passionate praise of our great leader Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line, and a powerful criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Standing under the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," gazing at the towering image of our great leader Mao reaching into the clouds, recalling the victorious battle journey of our great motherland under the red sun over the past half-century, and looking forward to our glorious future, how can one not be moved and blood boil? How can one not be filled with strong anger and hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, who shamelessly distorts the history of the Anshan revolutionary struggle and tries to drag China into endless darkness? Listening to the majestic and stirring piano music, thinking of the thorough revolutionary spirit of the Li Yuhe family, who, under the leadership of the great leader Mao, have gone through three generations of unyielding, life-and-death, and heroic struggles, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, how can one not strongly condemn the traitor philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev? The proletarian revolutionary art works can produce such a powerful fighting force precisely because every note and every drop of color in them are condensed with the demands, will, and aspirations of the revolutionary people of our time.

Great revolutionary struggles produce and form great themes; only great themes can reflect the great face of the era. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern," born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reflect the revolutionary requirements of the great era and are directly produced under the impetus of this great revolution. Their appearance will inevitably trigger a chain reaction in various departments of the superstructure, thereby further consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology and playing an extremely important role in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Ancient for the Present, Foreign for the Chinese

The successful birth of the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," like the eight model revolutionary operas, are all great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on art and a great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese."

Each era has its own art. The art of a certain era is a product of the reflection of the social life of that era in the minds of writers, serving the politics of a certain era and a certain class. The content of ancient and foreign art, in general, is the reflection of the political wishes and emotional expressions of the exploiting classes of ancient times and foreign countries, serving the exploiting classes of ancient times and foreign countries. This content can only have a destructive effect on the proletarian politics of socialist China and cannot be used by us; it must be thoroughly criticized and swept away through revolutionary criticism. However, in terms of artistic forms and artistic characteristics, each era and each nation have their unique features. It is wrong to either uncritically accept everything or to negate everything with nihilism. We should use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to critically inherit the beautiful artistic forms and characteristics that have appeared in the history of our country and foreign countries, transforming and innovating the useful elements, and serving proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" have set an example of "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese." The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" not only retains the rich colors, strong sense of reality, and excellence in portraying characters of Western oil painting but also absorbs the concise brushwork, prominent characters, and detailed depiction of traditional Chinese painting, successfully creating the brilliant image of the young Chairman Mao, the world's proletarian leader and teacher, and the greatest genius of the contemporary era. The piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" not only retains the basic characteristics of Beijing opera singing, such as high-pitched, stirring, upright, frank, and clear rhythm, but also fully exploits the broad range, magnificent momentum, strong and bright timbre, and strong expressiveness of the piano, thereby not only opening up a new path for Western musical instruments and symphony but also opening up a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's drama. The success of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" has opened up new paths for us to further enrich and develop socialist art with distinctive era characteristics and unique national style.

The absorption and utilization of artistic forms and characteristics must be determined based on the political content of the proletariat and the need to portray the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cannot be uncritically copied. The success of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" lies not only in the successful use of foreign artistic forms but more importantly in the fact that the authors, under the guidance of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, based on the political needs of the proletariat, created something new on the basis of revolutionary criticism, thus blooming the brilliant flowers of proletarian art. The great policy of "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese" is strongly class-oriented and is proposed on the premise that art must serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today's China is a socialist new China where the proletariat holds state power, and this "use" must be for the proletariat to use and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to use. Without this class content, abstractly talking about "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese" is something that all exploiting classes can accept. In the past few years, wasn't there someone who used foreign techniques to paint Chinese donkeys and women and was praised by the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line as a "model" of "foreign for the Chinese"? Wasn't there someone who used the "foreign instrument" of the violin to portray the talents and beauties of ancient China and was praised by the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line as a "model" of national forms and widely praised? It is very clear that without the actual needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so-called reforms are all false reforms and false revolutions. We must be vigilant against the class enemies who peddle bourgeois and revisionist goods under the guise of "reform."

The successful experience of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" tells us that the process of "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese" is a revolutionary process, a process of "innovating the old," and a process of using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the old world and open up a new world. Some people have a ruler in their minds. They regard the works of those so-called "art masters" they worship and kneel before as the highest standard. In their eyes, the artworks we create are only good if they are exactly the same as the idols they worship; otherwise, if there are differences and changes, they are degraded as "neither horse nor mule." These people have neither a bit of the revolutionary spirit of creating new things that the proletariat should have, nor do they understand the universal laws of art development. Originally, we critically absorb the useful things from the art of ancient times and foreign countries only to create our own proletarian revolutionary art, not to bring the art that served the feudal class and bourgeoisie of ancient times and foreign countries to socialist new China. Can our proletarian art be "like" the decadent art of the bourgeoisie? Can the heroic images of our workers, peasants, and soldiers be "like" gods, emperors, talents, beauties, knights, and noblewomen? No, absolutely not. If it is "like," it means that our proletarian art has degenerated, rotted, and stunk! Look at the Soviet Union today, it is indeed full of the filth of so-called "Western civilization," not only "like," but it is "exactly like"! But isn't it precisely in this place that the capitalist restoration has taken place in all realms from ideological consciousness to politics and economy? In fact, whether in China or in foreign countries, any era's successful art is the result of absorbing the excellent achievements of its predecessors and creating something new based on the social requirements of that time. Is oil painting "like" the various paintings that came before it? Is the piano "like" the various musical instruments that came before it? Is Beijing opera "like" the local operas from which it developed? Art that takes the pursuit of being "like" its object of imitation as the highest standard is decadent art, and the result will be no art. To create new proletarian revolutionary art, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, critically absorb the useful things from the art of past eras, and based on the actual needs of the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers in socialist China, boldly establish the newness of socialism and the uniqueness of the proletariat. On this issue, we must thoroughly eliminate the superstition of ancient and foreign things and thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, Zhou Yang, and their gang of worshipping foreign cultures and restoring ancient ones. The world has always been the new revolutionary forces defeating the reactionary and decadent old forces. We should establish the pride of the proletarian revolutionary faction, with unwavering confidence and boundless enthusiasm, do what our predecessors have not done, and under the great and invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, create a great proletarian revolutionary new art that is worthy of our great leader, great party, great country, great people, and great army.

	Worldview, Art View

The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern," which bloomed brilliantly in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have brought great encouragement and strong resonance to revolutionary art workers. They increasingly realize the profoundness and importance of the teachings of our great leader Mao: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," "intellectuals must continue to reform themselves, gradually abandoning the bourgeois worldview and establishing the proletarian, communist worldview."

Politics has always been the commander of art. Art view is the reflection of worldview in the realm of literature and art. Although politics is not equal to art, and worldview is not equal to the methods of art creation and art criticism, all art creations are reflections of a certain worldview; and the appreciation of art works is inevitably dominated by a certain worldview. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" are works with strong political and class characteristics. They meet the political needs of the proletariat and reflect the will and aspirations of the proletariat. The reason they can do this is ultimately because the works are produced under the guidance of the proletarian worldview, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. In the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," the analysis of the class struggle situation in China in the 1920s, the understanding of the struggle between the two lines within the party, and the image summary of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary character in his youth, all of these are first and foremost political issues, worldview issues, not business issues or technical issues. If there is not a strong hatred for the traitor philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev, and if there is not a full understanding of the sublime spiritual appearance of proletarian revolutionary heroes, can the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern" handle the portrayal of Li Yuhe walking to the execution ground with such magnificent momentum? Throughout history, countless decadent artists of the exploiting classes have created countless works around the theme of life and death separation, either sad and sorrowful, or mournful and miserable, at most adding a bit of personal heroism and chivalry. They cannot see the future, nor can they have a future; they cannot see the light, nor can they have true light. Only the most thorough revolutionary proletariat, only the proletarian art that reflects the proletarian worldview, and only the revolutionary art workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can make the proletarian heroes shine brightly on their art stage, with a brilliance that outshines the sun and moon, and a momentum that swallows mountains and rivers!

Just as there are only two major factions in worldview: proletarian and bourgeois, there are also only these two major opposing factions in art view. The creation or appreciation of art works seems to be an individual activity, but in fact, they are all constrained by their class positions. The reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie and some bourgeois intellectuals proudly boast that their works have "their own personality" and "their own shadow." What is their "personality" and "shadow"? "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." Their "personality" and "shadow" are the tenacious manifestations of their bourgeois worldview. Revolutionary art workers, on the other hand, take pride in being ordinary members of the worker and peasant masses and regard reflecting the will and aspirations of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses as their highest task.

The authors of these two new models of revolutionary art, the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern," are not isolated individuals locked in a study painting or playing the piano, but together with hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, using their brushes and piano keys to join the great study and criticism struggle. The revolutionary mass movement has opened up the broadest horizon for their creation and provided the richest nourishment; the boundless love of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people for our great leader Mao has driven them to determine and form the themes of these great art works. If they do not join the great revolutionary struggle, do not want to share the same breath and fate with millions of revolutionary people, but only lock themselves in their narrow personal world, talking about techniques all day, even if their techniques are good, they can only express the triviality of the individual and can never express our great era and create towering heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today, in the deepening development of the socialist revolution, if one still insists on going down this decadent path, one will inevitably go down the path of anti-party and anti-socialism and will forever be despised by the people.

Our great leader Mao recently taught us: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work." The development of proletarian revolutionary art needs a revolutionary art team armed with the proletarian worldview, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. The establishment of this team is impossible without the leadership of the working class. Revolutionary art workers must sincerely learn from the working class, and on the basis of doing a good job in the work of cleaning up the class ranks, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, unite with them, and reform their worldview. The working class should enter the art world, play a leading role, and use the proletarian worldview, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, to reform the art team and promote the art revolution.

Revolution is the locomotive of history. The unprecedentedly great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will not only greatly liberate productive forces, making socialist industry and agriculture achieve unprecedented leaps and bounds of development, but will also bring unprecedented prosperity to literature and art. The bourgeoisie had an era called the Renaissance, but compared to the new era of proletarian revolutionary art, it is only a small hill under a towering peak. The birth and growth of proletarian revolutionary new art will always be a serious and sharp struggle. However, the successful birth of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern," as well as the eight model revolutionary operas, tell us that we can break through strongholds like Beijing opera, and capture strongholds like oil painting, piano, symphony, and ballet. Therefore, on our forward march, what unbreakable positions are there, and what difficulties can we not overcome? The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" and the piano-accompanied opera "The Red Lantern," as well as the eight model revolutionary operas, are like a batch of spring flowers, heralding the arrival of the spring of unprecedented prosperity in proletarian revolutionary art. Let us take Comrade Jiang Qing as a shining example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, set high aspirations, establish great ambitions, and firmly be thorough proletarian revolutionaries, striving forward to create and develop proletarian revolutionary new art!

    迎接无产阶级革命文艺新时代的到来
    丁学雷
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命所引起的伟大变革，现在正在各个方面不断地显示出来。就在我们夺取文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这两朵瑰丽的艺术之花，并蒂盛开，光芒四射地诞生了！
    这两朵无产阶级文艺新花的开放，是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的可喜收获！是江青同志的又一杰出贡献！
    毛主席教导我们：“革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”文艺革命从来就是政治革命的重要组成部分，在无产阶级文化大革命这样空前伟大、空前深刻的政治大革命中，尤其是这样。因此，革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，不仅仅是文艺界的一件大事，同时也是无产阶级整个社会主义革命事业中的一件大事。
           伟大的时代　伟大的艺术
    艺术，归根结底是由政治支配并为政治服务的。伟大的时代产生伟大的艺术。空前伟大的无产阶级文化大革命必将产生空前伟大的革命艺术。
    真正伟大的艺术作品，必然是反映当代最重大的主题、最重要的题材的。主题或题材，从来就是一个重大的政治问题，即一个阶级对另一个阶级在意识形态领域实行统治或专政中的一个重大问题。任何阶级的艺术，不论是音乐和美术，都是选择对于自己阶级最有意义的题材，以创作最能为自己的阶级服务的作品。就资产阶级的美术而言，所谓文艺复兴时代的题材，莫不取自宗教和神话，或是诸侯和贵妇，总之，只歌颂“天上”或人间的统治者，从不歌颂劳动人民。至于现代资产阶级的绘画题材，更是腐朽没落，不是裸女就是浴妇，或者是一堆谁也看不懂的乱七八糟的玩艺儿，以满足资产阶级老爷在酒酣饭饱之余追求感官刺激的需要。如果说，资产阶级在上升时期，还产生了一些取材于希腊、罗马神话传说中的英勇行为和自我牺牲等主题的图画，用以掩饰其一切为了追求利润的卑劣动机的话，那么现在，这个阶级已经完全没落了，它不再需要伪善的面具来掩饰，而是赤裸裸地显露了贪婪、无耻、放荡、残酷的吃人本相。在资产阶级成为统治阶级之后，他们手中的画笔、琴键，如同被他们控制的法庭、监狱一样，都是用来对无产阶级在不同领域实行专政的工具。
      “历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”。千百年来剥削阶级的文学艺术史就是这样一篇被颠倒了的罪恶史！
    无产阶级登上了政治舞台，就是要把这个旧案翻过来！
    一百多年来，从巴黎公社到十月革命，到一九四九年的中国革命，无产阶级在波澜壮阔的革命斗争中，也产生了一些反映自己斗争的艺术作品。在毛主席的革命文艺路线指引下的中国京剧革命，把无产阶级的文艺革命提到了一个空前未有的高度。在这场伟大的革命中，坚定的无产阶级革命家、我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领广大的革命文艺战士，顶逆流、战恶浪，披荆斩棘，突破重围，接连攻克了京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响乐以及钢琴、油画等顽固堡垒，从此工农兵真正“杀”上了文艺舞台，把盘踞文艺舞台几千年之久的死人洋人抛进了历史的垃圾箱，被剥削阶级颠倒了的历史重新颠倒了过来。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》之所以引起了亿万革命人民的热烈欢呼，就在于它完美地体现了关系到中国命运和人类命运这样伟大的主题，深刻地表达了亿万革命人民的革命理想和政治愿望。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是无产阶级和革命人民最杰出的代表。革命油画《毛主席去安源》所展示的，就是我们伟大领袖毛主席，在亲手缔造了伟大的中国共产党以后，背负着中国人民的希望，胸怀着改造世界的宏图，跋山涉水，亲自到安源这个当时我国重要的工矿区，播下革命火种，开辟胜利航道，解决中国人民进行武装夺取政权这个当代最重大最复杂的课题。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》所塑造的李玉和一家的高大英雄形象，就是在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，经历了世界无产阶级革命史上最长期、最激烈、最艰苦、最复杂的革命斗争考验的千千万万可歌可泣的英雄人物的化身，是毛泽东思想哺育起来的中国无产阶级先进代表的优秀品质和崇高精神境界的高度概括。这两件反映了当代最重大的主题的无产阶级艺术珍品，是对伟大领袖毛主席和他的无产阶级革命路线的热烈的颂歌，也是对中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命修正主义路线的有力的批判。
    站在油画《毛主席去安源》下面，仰望着伟大领袖毛主席耸入云天的崇高形象，回顾在红太阳照耀下的伟大祖国半个世纪来的胜利的战斗历程，展望我们的光辉远景，怎能不心潮澎湃、热血沸腾？又怎能不对中国赫鲁晓夫这个无耻地篡改安源革命斗争历史、妄图把中国拖向无穷无尽黑暗的机会主义者激起强烈的愤怒和憎恨？聆听着雄伟激越的琴声，思念在毛泽东思想哺育下的李玉和一家三代前仆后继、出生入死、英勇奋斗的无产阶级彻底革命精神，又怎能不对中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学引起强烈的谴责？无产阶级的革命艺术作品之所以能产生如此强大的战斗力量，就是因为这里的每一个音符、每一滴色彩都凝结着我们时代的革命人民的要求、意志和愿望。
    伟大的革命斗争，产生和形成伟大的主题；而只有伟大的主题，才能反映伟大的时代面貌。在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，反映了伟大时代的革命要求，是直接在这一伟大革命的推动下产生的。它们的出现，又必将引起上层建筑各部门的连锁反应，从而使无产阶级在意识形态领域里进一步巩固和强化对资产阶级的专政，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利起着极其重要的推动作用。
              古为今用　洋为中用
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命油画《毛主席去安源》的胜利诞生，和八个革命样板戏一样，都是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”文艺方针的伟大胜利。
    一个时代有一个时代的艺术。一定时代的艺术都是一定时代的社会生活在作家头脑中的反映的产物，是为一定时代的一定阶级的政治服务的。古的和洋的艺术，就其内容来说，大都是古代和外国的剥削阶级的政治愿望和思想感情的反映，是为古代和外国的剥削阶级服务的。这种内容，只能对社会主义中国的无产阶级政治产生破坏作用，不能为我们所用，必须通过革命的大批判，进行彻底的扫荡。但是，在艺术形式和艺术特色的某些方面，一个时代、一个民族，都有它独特的东西，毫无批判地全盘接受和虚无主义地全盘否定都是错误的。对于我们祖国和外国历史上出现过的美好的艺术形式和艺术特色，我们应当以毛泽东思想为武器加以批判的继承，把那些有用的成分经过改造，推陈出新，为无产阶级的政治服务，为工农兵服务。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》为我们树立了“古为今用，洋为中用”的样板。革命油画《毛主席去安源》既保持了西洋油画色彩丰富，真实感强，长于表现人物的特点，又吸收了中国传统绘画笔墨精练、人物突出、刻画细致的长处，成功地塑造了世界无产阶级导师和领袖、当代最伟大的天才毛主席青年时代的光辉形象。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》既保留了京剧唱腔高亢、激越、挺拔、爽朗、节奏鲜明等基本特点，又充分发挥了钢琴音域广阔、气势磅礴、音质强健明亮、表现力强的特色，从而不仅为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，也为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，为我们进一步丰富和发展具有鲜明的时代特点和独特的民族风格的社会主义艺术开辟了新的途径。
    艺术形式和艺术特色的汲取和利用，必须根据无产阶级的政治内容和塑造工农兵英雄人物的需要而定其取舍，决不能毫无批判地加以照搬。革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功之处，不仅在于成功地运用了外来的艺术形式，更重要的在于作者在我们敬爱的江青同志的指导下，根据无产阶级的政治需要，在革命的批判的基础上进行了崭新的创造，方始开出了灿烂的无产阶级的艺术之花。“古为今用，洋为中用”的伟大方针是有强烈的阶级性的，是在文艺必须为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的前提下提出来的。今天的中国是无产阶级掌握了国家政权的社会主义新中国，这个“用”就必须是为无产阶级所利用，为工农兵所利用。离开了这个阶级内容，抽象地谈什么古为今用、洋为中用，那是一切剥削阶级都可以接受的。前几年，不是有人用洋技巧来画中国的毛驴和女人而被反革命修正主义文艺黑线当作洋为中用的“样板”加以吹捧吗？不是又有人用小提琴这种“洋乐器”表现中国古代的才子佳人而被反革命修正主义文艺黑线当作民族形式的“典范”而大肆吹捧吗？十分清楚，离开了工农兵的实际需要的所谓改革，都是假改革、假革命，我们必须谨防阶级敌人在“改革”的幌子下贩卖资产阶级、修正主义的货色。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功经验告诉我们，“古为今用，洋为中用”的过程是一个革命的过程，是一个“推陈出新”的过程，是一个用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去批判旧世界、开拓新世界的过程。有些人的头脑里藏着一把尺子，他们把自己推崇备至、顶礼膜拜的那些所谓“艺术大师”们的作品奉为最高标准。在这些人看来，我们创作出来的艺术品，只有和他们所信奉的神物一模一样，才是好的；反之，有了差别，走了样子，就被贬之为“非驴非马的四不象”。这些人，既没有一丝一毫无产阶级应有的创造新生事物的革命气概，也根本不懂得艺术发展的普遍规律。本来，我们批判地吸收古代和外国艺术中那些有用的东西，只是为了创造我们自己无产阶级的革命的艺术，根本不是为了把古代的和外国的为封建阶级、资产阶级服务的艺术搬到社会主义的新中国来。难道说，我们无产阶级艺术能够“象”资产阶级的腐朽艺术吗？我们工农兵的英雄形象能够“象”神仙皇帝、才子佳人、骑士贵妇吗？不能，绝对不能。如果“象”了，那就说明我们无产阶级的艺术已经变质了，霉烂了，发臭了！试看今日之苏联，倒确实到处充满着那些所谓“西方文明”的污泥浊水，岂但是“象”，简直是“象”极了！但不正是在这个地方，从思想意识领域直至政治、经济等领域内出现了资本主义的全面复辟吗？其实，中国和外国无论哪一个时代的有成就的艺术，都是吸收了它前代的优秀的成果而又从当时的社会要求出发，才有了新的创造。油画和它以前的各种绘画“象”吗？钢琴和它以前的各种乐器“象”吗？京剧和它据之发展起来的地方戏“象”吗？以追求“象”它的模仿对象为最高标准的艺术是没落的艺术，结果也就不会有什么艺术。为了创造无产阶级革命的新艺术，我们就是要以毛泽东思想为武器，批判地吸收过去时代的艺术中有用的东西，从我们社会主义中国的工农兵斗争生活的实际需要出发，大胆地标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。在这个问题上，我们一定要彻底破除对古人和洋人的迷信，要彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫、周扬一伙的那一套崇洋复古的反动谬论的流毒。世界上从来都是新生的革命力量战胜反动腐朽的旧势力。我们应该树立无产阶级革命派的自豪感，信心百倍、干劲冲天地去做前人所没有做过的事，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指导下，去创造无愧于我们伟大的领袖、伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民、伟大的军队的伟大的无产阶级革命新文艺。
              世界观　艺术观
    在无产阶级文化大革命中夺目开放的革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这两朵无产阶级文艺新花，给革命的文艺工作者带来了极大的鼓舞，激起了强烈的反响。他们越来越清楚地认识到伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”，“知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观”，是何等的深刻，何等的重要！
    政治从来是统帅艺术的。艺术观就是世界观在文学艺术领域内的反映。固然，政治并不等于艺术，世界观也并不等于艺术创作和艺术批评的方法。但是，一切艺术作品的创作都是一定的世界观的反映；而对艺术作品的欣赏也必然地受着一定的世界观的支配。革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》都是带有强烈的政治性、阶级性的作品，它们适应了无产阶级的政治需要，反映了无产阶级的意志和愿望。而所以能做到这样，归根结底是因为作品是在无产阶级世界观即毛泽东思想指导下产生的。在革命油画《毛主席去安源》中，对于二十世纪二十年代我国国内阶级斗争形势的分析，对于党内两条路线斗争的认识，对于毛主席青年时代伟大的革命气质的形象概括，这一切，首先都是政治问题，世界观问题，而不是业务问题，技术问题。如果不是对于中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学有强烈的仇恨，如果不是对于无产阶级革命英雄的崇高的精神面貌有充分的认识，钢琴伴唱
  《红灯记》在塑造李玉和走向刑场的光辉形象时，能作出如此气势磅礴的处理吗？古今中外，万千没落的剥削阶级的艺术家，围绕着生离死别这个主题，创作了浩如烟海的作品，不是悲悲切切，就是凄凄惨惨，最多加上一点显示个人英雄主义的义侠血性。他们看不到前途，也不可能有前途；他们看不到光明，也不能有真正的光明。只有最具有彻底革命精神的无产阶级，只有反映无产阶级世界观的无产阶级文艺，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命的文艺工作者，才能够让无产阶级的英雄人物在自己的文艺舞台上焕发出光照日月、气吞山河的光辉来！
    如同世界观只有无产阶级和资产阶级两大家一样，艺术观也只有这样根本对立的两大家。创作或欣赏艺术作品，看来似乎是个人的活动，其实都是受他们的阶级地位所制约的。资产阶级反动“权威”和某些资产阶级知识分子，颇为自得地吹嘘他们的作品是有“自己的个性”、“自己的影子”的。他们的“个性”和“影子”是什么呢？“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”他们的“个性”和“影子”，就是他们的资产阶级世界观的顽强的表现。革命的文艺工作者则以自己是工农群众中的普通一员为最大光荣，以反映亿万革命群众的意志和愿望为最高任务。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这两个革命文艺新样板的作者，不是孤立地一个人关在书斋里作画、弹琴，而是同亿万革命人民一起，用他们的画笔和琴键一起投入了大学习、大批判的斗争。革命的群众运动为他们的创作开辟了最广阔的天地，提供了最丰富的养料；亿万革命群众无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的心情和愿望，驱使着他们确定和形成了这些伟大艺术作品的主题。如果不去投入伟大的革命斗争，不愿与千百万革命人民共呼吸同命运，光是关在个人狭隘的小天地内，一天到晚技巧、技巧，这种技巧再好，也只能表现渺小的个人，根本不可能表现我们伟大的时代和塑造高大的工农兵英雄形象。在社会主义革命深入发展的今天，如果还是硬要朝这条没落的路子走去，那么必然走向反党反社会主义的道路，而永远为人民所唾弃。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”无产阶级革命文艺的发展，需要有一支用无产阶级世界观即毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺队伍。这支队伍的树立，离开工人阶级的领导是绝对不行的。革命的文艺工作者要老老实实地向工人阶级学习，在搞好清理阶级队伍工作的基础上，到工农兵中间去，同工农兵相结合，改造自己的世界观。工人阶级要进入文艺界，发挥领导作用，用无产阶级世界观即毛泽东思想，改造文艺队伍，促进文艺革命。
    革命是历史的火车头。历史上空前伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，不但将大大解放生产力，使社会主义工农业生产得到空前飞跃的发展，也必将带来文学艺术的空前繁荣。资产阶级有过一个称之为文艺复兴的时代，但比起无产阶级革命文艺的新时代来，只不过是耸入云霄的高峰之下的一个小小的土丘。无产阶级革命新文艺的诞生和成长，将始终是一场严重尖锐的斗争。但是，革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》以及八个革命样板戏的胜利诞生告诉我们，象京剧这样的顽固堡垒我们可以突破，象油画、钢琴、交响乐和芭蕾舞这样一些顽固堡垒我们可以攻克，那么，在我们前进的征途上，还有什么不可突破的阵地，还有什么克服不了的困难呢？革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》以及八个革命样板戏，就象一批报春花一样，预示着无产阶级革命文艺空前繁荣的春天即将来临。让我们以江青同志为光辉榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树雄心，立壮志，坚持做彻底的无产阶级革命派，为创造和发展无产阶级的革命新文艺而奋勇前进吧！
