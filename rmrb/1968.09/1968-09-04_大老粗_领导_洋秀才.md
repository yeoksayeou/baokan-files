	“Can you rough workers who operate machines lead those who speak foreign languages?” Members of the Shanghai Workers’ Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, including Xu Yinhe and his comrades, faced this question when they entered Shanghai Foreign Languages Institute. However, they were not intimidated.

	Xu Yinhe, an old carpenter from Shanghai Pioneer Electric Machinery Factory, eagerly volunteered to join the Workers’ Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team after hearing Chairman Mao’s directive to organize such teams to lead the educational revolution. However, the revolutionary committee of his workshop did not allow him to go, citing family difficulties. Xu Yinhe got angry and said, “What family? My family has only three people, and the country has 700 million. Comparing ‘three’ with ‘seven hundred million,’ ‘three’ is very small. No matter how big the difficulty, I must go! Although I am a rough worker, as long as I act according to Mao Zedong Thought, I can lead those foreign scholars!”

	To propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the students, dozens of workers nearing retirement also joined the Workers’ Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. They said, “By age, it is time for us to retire, but our thoughts cannot retire, and the revolution cannot retire. Once thoughts retire, revisionism will creep in. We workers must revolutionize for life, whether in the factory, school, or at home.”

	The Workers’ Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered Shanghai Foreign Languages Institute and propagated Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionary teachers and students, greatly educating them. Previously, revolutionary teachers and students always thought that “foreign languages are special” and that the distance between workers and foreign languages is too great. How could workers who do not understand foreign languages lead the foreign language educational revolution? Now, they feel that the workers standing beside them are so great, while they themselves are so small. The Red Guards said: It is not that the distance between workers and foreign languages is too great, but that the distance between us and the workers is too great. It is not that foreign language courses are special, but that our thoughts are “special.”

	The excellent qualities of the working class are inspiring the Red Guards. The Red Guards are eagerly making friends with their “teachers,” forming “Red Pairs,” and learning Mao Zedong Thought and the excellent qualities of the working class from them.

### “大老粗”领导“洋秀才”

    “大老粗”领导“洋秀才”
    “你们这些捏摇手柄的‘大老粗’，能领导好会讲洋话的‘洋秀才’吗？”上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员徐银和同他的战友，在踏进上海外国语学院校门之前，碰到了这样的问题，但是他们没有被吓倒。
    徐银和，这个上海先锋电机厂的老木工，听到毛主席指示要组织工人毛泽东思想宣传队，领导教育革命，他就急着要求参加。可是，车间革委会的同志不让他去，说他家里有困难。老徐一听就火了，说：“什么家不家的，我家里只有三口人，全国有七亿人，拿‘三’和‘七亿’比较一下，‘三’就很渺小嘛，天大的困难我也要去！我虽然是个‘大老粗’，可是，只要按毛泽东思想办事，就能去领导那些‘洋秀才’！”
    为了向这些学校的同学宣传毛泽东思想，几十个即将退休的老工人，也参加了工人毛泽东思想宣传队。他们说：“按年龄，是到退休的时候了，可是思想不能‘退休’，革命不能‘退休’。思想一退，就要‘修’了。我们工人阶级不论在厂、在校、在家都要干一辈子革命。”
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入了上海外国语学院，向革命师生宣传毛泽东思想，使他们受到很大教育。过去，革命师生们总认为“外语特殊”，“外语”与工人之间的距离太远，不懂外语的工人领导外语的教育革命怎么行呢？现在，他们感到站在自己身边的工人阶级多么高大；而自己却那么渺小。红卫兵小将说：不是工人与外语之间的距离太远，而是我们与工人之间的距离太远，不是外语功课特殊，而是我们的思想“特殊”。
    工人阶级的优秀品质在鼓舞着红卫兵小将，红卫兵小将纷纷结识自己的“老师”，结成“一对红”，要从他们手里接过毛泽东思想，学习工人阶级的优秀品质。
