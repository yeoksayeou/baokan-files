	Dearest Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	The land of our motherland is red and vibrant, "all under heaven rejoices with the music of Yutian."

	Under your loving care and under the great inspiration of your latest instructions, the frontline of anti-revisionism and anti-imperialism in the northwest of our motherland is triumphant. The Revolutionary Committees of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City have been born in glory, born in victory!

	Today, today, from the mines of Altay to the pastures of Pamir, from the cotton fields of Tarim to the granaries of Junggar, the brilliant banners gather into a red sea, and the waves of joy surge in the land of song and dance. The eight million people of various ethnic groups cheer for the brilliant victory of your thoughts, cheer for the glorious achievements of your revolutionary line, and sing a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Hurrah for Chairman Mao!" We wish you, dear leader, a thousand times, ten thousand times, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your heart is connected with the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups. You have brought us endless happiness and opened up the path to victory for us.

	Remembering the past, "a hundred-year-old demon dances gracefully." Old Xinjiang was covered by a thousand layers of dark clouds over the grasslands. Everywhere were the shackles of the beys and the whips of the landlords. In that long night and harsh winter, it was you who brought us warmth, sent your relative Mao Zemin, and brought the great truth—the brilliance of your thoughts. From then on, the seeds of revolution from Jinggangshan were planted in our hearts, and the unquenchable light of Yan'an shone before our eyes. Day and night, we longed for you, the savior of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao!

	"As the rooster crows, the world turns white," and the red sun rises over the Tian Shan Mountains. The people of all ethnic groups rejoice in their liberation and emancipation, and a new chapter in Xinjiang's history begins.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How can we forget that soon after liberation, you called on the People's Liberation Army to do more good deeds for the people of all ethnic groups, to defend and build the border areas. It was our relatives who, with swords and horses, swept across the grasslands, drove away the wolves, and brought your sunshine into the yurts. It was our relatives who awakened millions of serfs, smashed the feudal estates, and "divided the land and fields busily." It was our relatives who established military farms, and the spirit of Nanniwan shone brightly. The vast desert was crisscrossed with canals, and the vast sea was filled with the fragrance of rice. The ancient wilderness was painted with "the newest and most beautiful picture," setting a brilliant example for the construction of socialist Xinjiang.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How can we forget that at the moment of celebrating the victory of land reform, you wrote a personal letter to the Uyghur farmers of Kashgar, with each word and sentence shining with golden light, spreading joy throughout the Tian Shan region. We had a guiding light for building a new life, following you in continuing the revolution, forever moving forward.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How can we forget that at the time of the socialist high tide in the countryside, you highly praised the enthusiasm of the Uyghur farmers in taking the cooperative path, and refuted the right-wing opportunist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk that cooperation could not be achieved among ethnic minorities. Under your guidance, we raised high the revolutionary red flags of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and advanced together with the people of the entire country on the broad road of socialism.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How can we forget that in the days when the anti-China tide was surging, you led us to smash the subversive and destructive plots of the Soviet revisionists and achieved great victories in the self-defense counterattack war on the Sino-Indian border. The stupid camels stretched their necks in vain, hoping to eat the grass on the other side of the mountain, and the foolish flies only met with a few miserable cries and sobs.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How can we forget that eighteen years ago you kindly instructed us: "To thoroughly solve the national question and completely isolate the national reactionaries, it is impossible without a large number of communist cadres from ethnic minorities." Under the brilliant guidance of your national policy, we achieved regional autonomy for ethnic minorities. Under the nurturing of your great thoughts, a large number of ethnic minority cadres grew and were tempered in the storms of class struggle. The treacherous plots of ethnic traitors to split the motherland were smashed time and time again. The great unity of the people of all ethnic groups, with you as the center, is like the evergreen pines of Tian Shan, standing firm for a thousand years.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! For the eternal redness of the socialist mountains and rivers of our motherland, for a brighter future for humanity, with the great talent and courage of a proletarian revolutionary, you personally initiated and led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, opening a new era in the international communist movement.

	With your command of "Bombard the Headquarters," the children of Tian Shan raised their flags and fought bravely, aiming at the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev and their reactionary line, firing! firing! Raising high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," we rebelled! rebelled! Riding the wind of the January Revolution, we launched a general offensive against the class enemies and fought a decisive battle! The revolutionary thunder shook Tian Shan north and south, and the revolutionary flames lit up both banks of the Tarim River.

	The class enemies, in a desperate attempt to save their doomed fate, ferociously attacked the proletariat, using all the despicable tricks of the counter-revolutionary two-faced faction, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, spreading poisonous winds, and shooting dark arrows, trying to turn the world upside down. In those days when the dark clouds pressed down on the city, the proletarian revolutionary factions of all ethnic groups, who were infinitely loyal to you, held close to the Little Red Book, looked up to Beijing, and advanced against the wind and waves. Your thoughts gave us boundless wisdom and unparalleled courage. The proletarian headquarters, with you as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as your deputy, cleared the mist for us, turned the tide, and guided us to repel the class enemies' repeated frenzied counterattacks, leading us to "sweep the red flag over the Great Pass."

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At the most critical moment of the struggle, you made timely and wise decisions, personally approving the issuance of the programmatic document of the Xinjiang Military Region's Cultural Revolution, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies, making the Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang advance victoriously along your revolutionary course.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At the most crucial juncture of the struggle, you issued the great battle cry: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." The spring thunder rumbled across Tian Shan, and the soldiers welcomed the troops with joy. The military and civilians of all ethnic groups were heart to heart, inseparable like fish and water. The People's Liberation Army, holding high the great red flag of your thoughts, used your thoughts to propagate and arm the masses, strongly supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions of all ethnic groups, resolutely executing and bravely defending your revolutionary line. In the great struggle to defend the national border, defend the Cultural Revolution, and carry out the "three supports and two military" tasks, they have made tremendous contributions! The People's Liberation Army, personally created and nurtured by you, is indeed a great heroic army, indeed the children of the people of all ethnic groups who are infinitely loyal to you.

	The red sun shines brightly in the sky, and countless golden rays shine into the ninth heaven. August 11th and 15th, 1968, are the most unforgettable and happiest moments of our lives. You and your closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, kindly received the cadres of the Xinjiang troops participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Beijing and the delegation from Xinjiang. This is your greatest concern, trust, education, and support for the revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the Xinjiang garrison. Your reception greatly inspired us to advance bravely on the great journey of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your series of latest instructions and your important instructions and directives on the Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang guide us from victory to victory. We follow your great strategic deployment, conquer evil, and bind the Peng, finally exposing to the public the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and reactionary local nationalists such as Wu Guang, Lü Jianren, Zhang Zhonghan, Yiminuofu, and Pao'erhan, who were the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xinjiang. We thoroughly smashed their evil plots to restore capitalism and split the unity of the motherland, achieving decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang, and welcoming the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Trees, no matter how tall, have roots; rivers, no matter how long, have sources. Reviewing the magnificent course of the struggle, which step was not guided by you, and which victory was not the result of your heart's blood? It is your thoughts that compose the magnificent epic of the Xinjiang revolution; it is your revolutionary line that paints the magnificent picture of the Xinjiang revolution.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The vast grasslands are like a zither, and the countless clear springs are like strings. The children of Tian Shan use the most beautiful language of thirteen ethnic groups to compose a song, dedicating it to you.

	The peak of Bogeda is high, but even the highest has a top; the grasslands of Altay are wide, but even the widest has an edge. Your kindness to us is endless, and it can never be sung enough. If all the trees in the world were turned into pens, all the water in the world into ink, and all the people in the world into poets, they could not write enough poems to praise you.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Through countless fierce struggles and repeated practices, we have understood a great truth: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great thoughts are the flag of the times, the torch of revolution, the source of strength, the guarantee of victory, and the highest standard for all our actions. They are the powerful ideological weapon to oppose all class enemies at home and abroad. On the new journey, we must hold high the red flag of your great thoughts, take Vice Chairman Lin, your closest comrade-in-arms, as a shining example, read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, act according to your instructions for a lifetime, and follow your revolution to the end for a lifetime.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will follow your great strategic deployment step by step, and carry out your latest instructions sentence by sentence. We will closely unite around the proletarian headquarters with you as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as your deputy, unite in thought, step, and action, thoroughly smash the reactionary bourgeoisie's "multi-center theory," and overthrow factionalism and sectarianism. We will forever advance victoriously along your revolutionary line.

	We will definitely continue to run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice that you personally advocated, "criticize and repudiate revisionism," strengthen proletarian party spirit, oppose bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly transform our worldview, carry out ideological revolutionization, and push the mass movement of studying and applying your brilliant thoughts to new heights, turning Xinjiang into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

	We will definitely not forget your great teachings on the struggle against revisionism, strengthen our sense of enemy danger, further intensify the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and be highly vigilant against the conspiracies and sabotage of class enemies at home and abroad. We will deeply propagate and resolutely carry out the proclamations you personally approved, and unite all ethnic groups to jointly fight against the enemy.

	We will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, firmly rely on the working class, "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." We will seize the opportunity to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, carry out the educational revolution, reform all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, and complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and ensure that the socialist iron mountains and rivers remain red for generations.

	We will definitely comprehensively implement your latest instructions, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination. According to your teachings on the revolutionary committees, we will build the revolutionary committees into a battle command post that forever raises high the great red flag of your thoughts, highlights proletarian politics, and is revolutionary and connected with the masses. We will resolutely smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the class enemies who attempt to split, sabotage, and overthrow the revolutionary committees, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees with our blood and lives.

	We will definitely remember your great teaching of "never forget class struggle," firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, carry out the great criticism in depth and for a long time, and do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks. We will accurately and firmly strike a small number of class enemies, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Xinjiang, and completely eliminate all traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries.

	We will definitely follow your proletarian line of party building, rectify the party organization, strengthen party building, and thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of party building of the Chinese Khrushchev. We will build the party organizations at all levels into "vibrant vanguard organizations that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies."

	We will definitely respond to your great call of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, do a better job in all aspects, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

	We will definitely follow your teachings of "supporting the army and loving the people" and "supporting the government and loving the people," further strengthen national unity, military-civilian unity, and military-political unity, consolidate the border defenses, defend the motherland, and be ready at any time to annihilate all invading enemies. We will turn the northwestern border of our motherland into an indestructible steel wall.

	We will definitely remember your teaching that the proletariat "can only finally liberate itself by liberating all of humanity," raise high the banner of internationalism, firmly support the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, and firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Let "the world share the same joy and sorrow," and let your brilliant thoughts illuminate the five lakes and four seas and spread red throughout the globe.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The guiding ideology of our people of all ethnic groups is your great thoughts. The leadership core of our people of all ethnic groups is the proletarian headquarters with you as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as your deputy. The common path of our people of all ethnic groups is the socialist and communist path guided by you. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who are infinitely loyal to you, use the blue sky as paper to write our resolutions and use our red hearts to express our oaths: The sea may dry up, and the stones may crumble, but the hearts of the children of Tian Shan will never change. We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your great thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line. The mountains may collapse, and the earth may split, but the will of the children of Tian Shan is firm. We will defend the unity of the motherland to the death, defend national unity to the death, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers personally created by you to the death.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this grand occasion, we miss you even more, the red sun in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups. We face Beijing, face the red sun, and play thousands of hotwafus together, and beat thousands of dafus together. We dance and sing to our hearts' content. Ten thousand words and ten thousand songs cannot express our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you. We sincerely wish you, the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    新疆维吾尔自治区及乌鲁木齐市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    祖国大地红烂漫，“万方乐奏有于阗”。
    在您的亲切关怀下，在您最新指示的巨大鼓舞下，祖国西北反修反帝前线高奏凯歌，新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市的革命委员会光荣诞生了，胜利诞生了！
    今天啊，今天，从阿勒泰矿山到帕米尔牧场，从塔里木棉海到准噶尔粮仓，鲜艳的战旗汇成红色海洋，欢乐的浪潮激荡歌舞之乡。八百万各族革命人民欢呼您光辉思想的又一伟大胜利，欢呼您革命路线的又一辉煌战果，一千遍一万遍地歌唱啊，歌唱“万岁，毛主席！”“亚夏，毛主席！”一千遍一万遍地祝愿啊，祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您和各族儿女心连心，您给我们带来了无限的幸福，您为我们开辟了胜利的航程。
    忆往昔，“百年魔怪舞翩跹”。旧新疆，千层乌云盖草原。到处是伯克的枷锁，巴依的皮鞭。在那漫长的黑夜，严酷的冬天，是您给我们送来温暖，派来亲人毛泽民，带来伟大的真理——您的光辉思想。从此，我们心上播下井冈山的革命火种，我们眼前闪耀着延安不灭的灯光。我们日日夜夜盼望您啊，各族人民的救星毛主席！
    “一唱雄鸡天下白”，天山升起红太阳。各族儿女喜庆翻身解放，新疆历史揭开崭新篇章。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怎能忘记，刚刚解放，您就号召人民解放军为各族人民多办好事，保卫边疆，建设边疆。是亲人挥戈跨马战草原，横扫残匪，赶走豺狼，把您的阳光送进毡房。是亲人唤起农奴千百万，砸烂封建庄园，“分田分地真忙”。是亲人扎营军垦，南泥湾精神大放光芒，茫茫戈壁渠如网，浩浩瀚海稻花香。万古荒原绘出“最新最美的画图”，为建设社会主义的新新疆树立了光辉榜样。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怎能忘记，在庆祝土地改革胜利的时刻，您老人家给喀什维吾尔农民写来亲笔信，字字句句金光闪，天山南北喜讯传。我们建设新生活有了指路明灯，紧跟您继续革命，永远向前。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怎能忘记，在农村社会主义高潮到来的时候，是您高度赞扬维吾尔农民走合作化道路的积极性，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫之流所谓在少数民族中不能实现合作化的右倾机会主义谬论。在您的指引下，我们高举党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的革命红旗，和全国人民一道在社会主义康庄大道上高歌猛进。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怎能忘记，在那反华逆流翻滚的日子里，您领导我们粉碎了苏修的颠覆破坏阴谋，取得了中印边境自卫反击战的伟大胜利。蠢骆驼把脖子伸得再长也休想吃上隔山草，碰壁的苍蝇只落得几声凄厉，几声抽泣。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怎能忘记，十八年前您就亲切教导我们：“要彻底解决民族问题，完全孤立民族反动派，没有大批从少数民族出身的共产主义干部，是不可能的。”在您民族政策的光辉照耀下，我们实现了民族区域自治。在您的伟大思想哺育下，大批少数民族干部在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼成长。民族败类妄图分裂祖国的罪恶阴谋，一次又一次地被我们粉碎。以您为中心的各族人民革命大团结，犹如天山劲松，万年长青。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！为了祖国社会主义江山永远鲜红，为了人类前途更加灿烂，您以无产阶级革命家的伟大的天才和气魄，亲自发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。
    您《炮打司令部》一声令下，天山儿女挥旗奋战，对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其推行的资产阶级反动路线，开炮！开炮！高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，造反！造反！乘着“一月革命”的东风，向阶级敌人发起总攻，展开大决战！革命风雷震荡天山南北，革命烽火映红塔河两岸。
    阶级敌人为了挽救其行将灭亡的命运，猖狂地向无产阶级进攻，他们使尽了反革命两面派的卑鄙伎俩，打着“红旗”反红旗，煽阴风，放暗箭，妄图翻天。在那黑云压城城欲摧的日子里，无限忠于您的各族无产阶级革命派，心贴红宝书，仰望北京城，迎着风浪向前进。您的思想给了我们无穷的智慧，无比的勇敢。以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，为我们拨开迷雾，力挽狂澜，指挥我们击退阶级敌人一次又一次疯狂反扑，引导我们“风卷红旗过大关”。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在那斗争最关键的时刻，您及时作出了英明的决策，亲自批准颁发了新疆军区生产建设兵团无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的反动气焰，使新疆无产阶级文化大革命沿着您的革命航道胜利向前。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在那斗争最紧要的关头，您又发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大战斗号令。天山南北春雷动，战地喜迎子弟兵，各族军民心贴心，鱼水难分骨肉情。亲人解放军高举您的思想伟大红旗，用您的思想宣传群众，武装群众，有力地支持了各族无产阶级革命派，坚决执行和英勇捍卫了您的革命路线，在保卫祖国边防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命和执行“三支”“两军”任务的伟大斗争中，立下了巨大的功勋！亲人解放军，不愧是您亲手缔造和培育的伟大的英雄军队，不愧是无限忠于您的各族人民的子弟兵。
    一轮红日当空照，万道金光射九霄。一九六八年八月十一日和十五日，是我们终生难忘的最最幸福的时刻，您和您的最亲密战友林副主席亲切接见了在京参加毛泽东思想学习班的新疆部队的干部和新疆代表团的同志。这是您对新疆各族革命群众和驻新疆解放军指战员的最大关怀，最大信任，最大教育，最大支持。您的接见，极大地鼓舞着我们在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大征途上奋勇前进！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的一系列最新指示，您对新疆无产阶级文化大革命极为重要的指示和批示，指引我们从胜利走向胜利。我们紧跟您的伟大战略部署，征腐恶，缚鲲鹏，终于把中国赫鲁晓夫在新疆的代理人武光、吕剑人、张仲瀚、伊敏诺夫、包尔汉等一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派、反动的地方民族主义分子揪出示众，彻底粉碎了他们复辟资本主义、分裂祖国统一的罪恶阴谋，夺取了新疆无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，迎来了新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市革命委员会的光荣诞生。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！树长千丈总有根，河流万里总有源。回顾波澜壮阔的战斗历程，哪一程不是您指引，哪一个胜利不是您的心血凝成。是您的思想，谱成新疆革命的壮丽史诗；是您的革命路线，绘出新疆革命的宏伟画卷。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千里草原当琴盘，万条清泉作琴弦，天山儿女用十三个民族最美好的语言编成歌，支支歌儿献给您。
    博格达山峰高啊，再高也有个顶；阿勒泰草原宽啊，再宽也有个边，您对我们的恩情啊，千秋万代唱不完。把天下的树都变成笔，把天下的水都变成墨，让天下的人都变成诗人，也写不完歌颂您的诗篇。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千百次严酷的斗争，千百次反复的实践，使我们懂得了一个伟大的真理：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的伟大思想是时代的旗帜，革命的火炬，力量的源泉，胜利的保证，是我们一切行动的最高准则，是反对国内外一切阶级敌人的强大思想武器。在新的征途上，我们一定要把您的伟大思想红旗高举更高举，以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事，一辈子紧跟您革命到底。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您伟大的战略部署我们步步紧跟，您光辉的最新指示我们句句照办。我们紧紧地团结在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底粉碎反动的资产阶级的  “多中心论”，打倒山头主义、宗派主义，永远沿着您的革命路线胜利前进。

    我们一定牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新疆的代理人彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭，把叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和一切反革命分子彻底扫除干净。
    我们一定要遵照您的无产阶级建党路线，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，把各级党的组织建设成为“能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”。
    我们一定坚决响应您的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，鼓足更大的革命干劲，掀起工农业生产的新高潮，把各方面的工作做得更好，夺取革命、生产双丰收。
