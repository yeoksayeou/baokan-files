Two hundred thousand students in Mexico City hold demonstrations

		Mexico City, September 26 (New China News Agency) – Students in Mexico’s capital, Mexico City, held demonstrations on the 24th and 25th, strongly protesting against the reactionary army’s occupation of schools and suppression of the student movement.

		On the 24th, twenty thousand students demonstrated near the Foreign Ministry building in the capital, protesting against the reactionary army’s occupation of schools. In the capital’s Tlatelolco district, several thousand people also held protest demonstrations and meetings. The demonstrators angrily threw stones at police cars, and the demonstrations lasted about two hours.

		On the 25th, one thousand students demonstrated in a public square in the southeast of the capital. The reactionary military police used tear gas and other means to suppress the demonstrating students. The students used burning cars as barricades and put up a brave resistance.

		After the reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of reactionary troops to occupy the National Autonomous University of Mexico on the 18th, they again used force to occupy the School of Fine Arts and the Santo Tomás Vocational School and 15 other schools on the morning of the 24th, attempting to use high-pressure tactics to extinguish the flames of the Mexican student movement. The students, undaunted by the violence, bravely resisted the reactionary troops that came to occupy the schools. The students said they would resolutely retake the schools occupied by the reactionary troops. Since the student movement has spread from the capital to various states in the interior, the reactionary troops also occupied the Guerrero University in the city of Chilpancingo and the Juárez University in the city of Oaxaca on the same day, encountering strong opposition from students and teachers.

		According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 27th, students in many states in the interior of Mexico held demonstrations and boycotts on the 24th, 25th, and 26th, strongly protesting against the reactionary army’s occupation of schools and suppression of the student movement, and supporting the capital’s students in their just struggle against violent suppression.

		On the 26th, more than ten thousand students in the state capital of Monterrey and one thousand students in the state capital of Mérida held marches and demonstrations to support the capital’s students. Students at the University of Torreón in northwestern Mexico held an indefinite boycott in support.

		On the 25th, students in the states of Guerrero, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Puebla, and Tamaulipas held marches and demonstrations. Eleven thousand students at the University of Puebla held a general boycott to support the capital’s students.

		Despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary military police, the capital’s students, undaunted by the violence, continued their struggle.
