Nationwide military and civilians are enthusiastically celebrating the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Northeast, Central South, and East China regions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to further implement Chairman Mao's instructions and thoroughly carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The broad masses of military and civilians have expressed their resolve to fully play the leading role of the working class, unite all possible forces, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On September 24, the New China News Agency reported: The hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the country, with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Northeast, Central South, and East China regions. They enthusiastically hail the brilliant victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of instructions. The hundreds of millions of military and civilians resolutely declare that they will, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, fully play the leading role of the working class. They will strive to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and march forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

One year ago, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, during his inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Northeast, Central South, and East China regions, pointed out with far-sighted vision: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent," and "In a few more months, the overall situation will become even better." The progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has fully proven that Chairman Mao's foresight is extremely wise and correct. On this joyous day of commemorating the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire country has already turned red, and the evil plot of the counter-revolutionary clique within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, to restore capitalism has been thoroughly foiled. The proletarian dictatorship in our country has been greatly consolidated and strengthened. The broad masses of military and civilians in various places are celebrating the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, repeatedly shouting: "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

In recent days, military and civilians in various places have held various commemorative activities. In the regions where Chairman Mao inspected one year ago, such as Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, various commemorative activities or mass celebration rallies have been held. Members of various levels of revolutionary committees, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards have reviewed the year-long battle course and re-examined Chairman Mao's series of instructions issued one year ago, feeling particularly close to them. They unanimously pointed out, based on their personal experiences, that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are the guiding beacons for the people of the entire country to continue advancing victoriously. They said, countless facts tell us that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment without deviating is victory! Fully and thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is victory!

The working class and the broad revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places discussed their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's series of instructions during the celebration activities. They said, every victory we have achieved proves that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our eyes will be bright, our direction will be clear, and our enthusiasm will be great! The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers in Wuhan reviewed the extremely warm, important, and wise instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of Hubei. Everyone was inspired and said, over the past year, we have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of instructions, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieved one great victory after another. The practice of struggle tells us that propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be swift; implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be thorough; following Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be unwavering; and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be unyielding. Members of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee said with great enthusiasm, the year-long battle course has made the children of Jinggangshan even more deeply realize that following Chairman Mao, our minds are clear and our direction is right; following Chairman Mao, no difficulty can stop us; following Chairman Mao, we have strength; following Chairman Mao, we are invincible!

Military and civilians and members of various levels of revolutionary committees in various places emphasized that to ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, we must use Chairman Mao's teachings on the unity of theory and practice as a weapon to resolutely fight against all bad practices of learning without doing and talking without acting. They said, only by learning and using Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters in unity, and by acting in unity, can we achieve victory in every battle. In the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must vigorously promote the three great styles of the Party cultivated by Chairman Mao, resolutely oppose the bad practices of hypocrisy, detachment from the masses, and covering up mistakes, and thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois ideas of "multiple centers," individualism, sectarianism, and factionalism. We must resolutely oppose the bad practice of paying lip service while acting against the instructions, and consolidate and develop the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a series of latest instructions, calling on us to thoroughly carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, "to fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work," and pointing out the direction for us to carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and stipulating the proletarian policies towards intellectuals. The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in various places, while celebrating the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and unanimously expressed that Chairman Mao's great instructions are the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The best practical action to celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection is to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and thoroughly fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new achievements.

Revolutionary workers in Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanning, and other cities said with great excitement that in the favorable situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's recently issued series of latest instructions are the greatest encouragement, education, and trust for us, the working class. We, the working class, are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to thoroughly carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, bravely shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the educational revolution and transforming the superstructure, and under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! The workers of the Datong Coal Mine in Qinghai resolutely declared that they must continuously improve their political awareness to ensure that Chairman Mao's every instruction and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters are smoothly implemented; to ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies the educational front and all domains of the superstructure. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Jiancheng Machinery Factory stationed at Harbin Normal University said in a discussion that Chairman Mao has entrusted us, the working class, with the heavy responsibility of leading the entire struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school. This is the greatest trust in us. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will work together with the PLA soldiers to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies. Together with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the school, we will carry out the educational revolution of the proletariat to the end and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! Revolutionary teachers and students in various places said that Chairman Mao calls on us to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. We will follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, resolutely take the revolutionary road of integrating with workers and peasants, thoroughly transform our worldview, and truly cultivate ourselves into ordinary laborers who never leave the workers and peasants. The broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA, who have established great merits in the "Three Supports and Two Militaries," recently held solemn celebration activities. The broad cadres and soldiers expressed their determination to give full play to the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship, to be the strong backbone of the working class leading everything, to further inherit and carry forward the Party's three great styles, and to create new achievements for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
