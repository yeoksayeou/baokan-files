	"We Barefoot Doctors" are great! We poor and lower-middle peasants love "Barefoot Doctors" the most. Some people say, "A junior high school graduate who has studied for a few years, what skills does he have to be a doctor?" No! We poor and lower-middle peasants need doctors like this.

	Think about the past. We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered under the oppression and exploitation of landlords, year after year with no doctors or medicine. When we got sick, we could only leave it to fate. Now, we poor and lower-middle peasants have "Barefoot Doctors" coming to our doors to treat us. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and care for us poor and lower-middle peasants!

	In early 1965, our New Dragon Brigade selected a daughter of a poor and lower-middle peasant to be trained as a doctor. This young woman is progressive in both her thoughts and work, and she understands our needs very well. After just a few months of training, she returned and started going to the fields with her medicine box to treat us poor and lower-middle peasants. She neither leaves her labor nor is she reluctant to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, reducing many of our troubles and being warmly welcomed by us. The community members affectionately call her the "Barefoot Doctor." When the "Barefoot Doctor" first started her rounds, she was a bit afraid—first, she feared her skills were not good enough, and second, she feared others would mock her. At that time, I accompanied her on her rounds, helping and encouraging her to boldly treat patients.

	Last summer, the "Barefoot Doctor" used the method of fumigation to kill mosquitoes and prevent diseases. When this method was just starting, some class enemies spread rumors among the community members saying, "The smoke is not good; it will kill the chickens and ducks, and people will also be poisoned." Because of these rumors, some community members did not dare to use the smoke. At this time, I quickly discussed with the "Barefoot Doctor," and we started fumigating from my house. Through practice, the community members saw that this was a good method for killing mosquitoes, foiling the class enemies' sabotage, and timely completing the work of killing mosquitoes and preventing diseases. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Only under Chairman Mao's leadership can there be such good 'Barefoot Doctors.'"

	Our great leader Chairman Mao instructs us to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the rural areas." Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev says nonsense like, "Each county should have a decent hospital." If we tear off the mask of the Chinese Khrushchev, we can see that this big bad guy is against Chairman Mao's policy of medical and health work facing the rural areas. In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants went out in the morning to see a doctor and could not return home in the evening. Now, the "Barefoot Doctors" treat us right in the fields. The Chinese Khrushchev also trained many "medical experts" with "knowledge," but these bourgeois gentlemen and ladies have no regard for us poor and lower-middle peasants and never come to the rural areas. What kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of vine bears what kind of fruit. Under the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, "Barefoot Doctors" have become our poor and lower-middle peasants' confidants. "Barefoot Doctors" are great! We poor and lower-middle peasants will actively support "Barefoot Doctors," educating them to always listen to Chairman Mao's words and wholeheartedly serve the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

### 我伲贫下中农最爱“赤脚医生”

     我伲贫下中农最爱“赤脚医生”
     上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子
     川沙县江镇公社新龙大队第三生产队队长     徐小妹
    “赤脚医生”就是好，我伲贫下中农最喜爱“赤脚医生”。有人说：“高小毕业生读了几年书有啥本事好做医生。”不对！我伲贫下中农就是需要这样的医生。
    想想过去，我伲贫下中农受尽地主压迫和剥削，长年缺医少药，生了病只好听天由命。现在，贫下中农有了“赤脚医生”上门来看病，这是毛主席他老人家对我伲贫下中农最大的关怀，最大的体贴！
    一九六五年初，我伲新龙大队挑选了一个贫下中农的女儿去培训当医生，这个青年思想上、工作上都很进步，很了解我伲贫下中农的要求，经过短短几个月训练，回来之后她就背起药箱下田头为我伲贫下中农看病，既不脱离劳动，又热心为贫下中农服务，减少了我伲不少麻烦，深受我伲贫下中农欢迎。社员们都热情地称呼她“赤脚医生”。“赤脚医生”初次出诊时有些害怕，一怕技术差，二怕别人讥笑她，这时我就陪着她出诊看病，跟在她身边帮助她，鼓励她，使她大胆地接触病人。
    去年夏天，“赤脚医生”为了预防疾病，采用熏烟的办法灭蚊，这方法刚刚开始，就有阶级敌人在社员中散布谣言说：“烟熏熏得不好鸡鸭都熏死，人也会中毒。”由于听了谣言，有些社员就不敢用烟熏了。在这个时候，我连忙同
  “赤脚医生”商量，就先从我屋里熏起。通过实践，社员们看到了这是灭蚊的好办法，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏，及时地做好了灭蚊防病工作。广大贫下中农说：“只有在毛主席领导下，才有这样好的‘赤脚医生’。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指示“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“一个县要有一个象样的医院”。撕开中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮就可以看出，这个大坏蛋就是反对毛主席的医疗卫生工作面向农村的方针。过去我伲贫下中农看病早上出去，晚上也不能回来。现在“赤脚医生”就在田边为我伲治病。中国赫鲁晓夫不是也培养了不少有“学问”的“医科专家”吗？这些资产阶级的少爷、小姐眼睛里根本没有我伲贫下中农，从来也不到农村里来。什么树开什么花，什么藤结什么瓜。在毛主席光辉思想照耀下，“赤脚医生”成了我伲贫下中农的贴心人。“赤脚医生”就是好！我伲贫下中农就是要积极支持“赤脚医生”，教育他们永远听毛主席的话，全心全意为广大贫下中农服务。（新华社）
