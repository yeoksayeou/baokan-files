Our brigade in the revolutionary criticism is how to grasp living thoughts?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's entire political tasks cannot be completed." Our Dongliushan Brigade, during the revolutionary criticism, because we grasped the ideological education of the masses and cadres, and promptly used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and arm the masses, every time we solve a problem of cognition with Mao Zedong Thought, the people gain a great impetus, their political awareness is greatly enhanced, and the revolutionary criticism advances a step further. We deeply feel that highlighting proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to promptly remove the "roadblocks" in people's minds, is a key issue in carrying out the revolutionary criticism in depth and over a long period.

When young and strong laborers actively participate in the revolutionary criticism, what should we do if some elderly people cannot quickly join in?

Send Mao Zedong's latest instructions to their hearts

"Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." In the revolutionary criticism, we pay special attention to giving full play to their role in charging into battle. However, some elderly laborers, especially those who are illiterate and have never spoken at public meetings, often cannot quickly join in. The brigade leadership, after investigation and research, seriously analyzed and recognized that most of these elderly people were exploited in the old society, unable to go to school, and have been "fighting hard in the countryside." Some people were activists during the democratic revolution period, and they know the most about past class struggles, have the most to say, and are the most authoritative. Why can't they keep up in the criticism? The main reason is that some elderly people, because they attend fewer meetings, do not fully understand the importance of revolutionary criticism, think they are uneducated, have low theoretical level, cannot compare with the quick-witted and eloquent young people, and mistakenly believe that revolutionary criticism is the business of educated young people. Moreover, our criticism methods are mechanical and rigid, with more large meetings and fewer small meetings, and it is also inconvenient for elderly people to participate in the criticism, thus some elderly people have the phenomenon of "spectating."

A ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We targeted these living thoughts of the elderly, organized them to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism" and "peasants in communes should also criticize the bourgeoisie," to raise their awareness of revolutionary criticism. We also selected young people with good thoughts and learning to be tutors, specially helping the elderly to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions; invited the elderly to talk about their past experiences of class struggle; conducted reminiscences of bitterness and sweetness, held elderly people's symposiums and criticism meetings. In addition, we also adopted methods such as on-site visits and reminiscences and comparisons to mobilize thoughts. This year in mid-June, we used carts to take more than sixty elderly people who had difficulty walking to the Beisha Forestry Brigade for a visit. When they saw that what was once a vast expanse of sand had now become an endless windbreak forest and countless fruit trees, they were all smiling and happy. They excitedly said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to take the socialist road, we would never have dreamed that this wasteland would become so good in the past." They excitedly shed tears of joy and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!" At this time, we led them to visit while explaining the history of class struggle in the Beisha River afforestation "three rises and three falls" over the years. From the afforestation and sabotage of afforestation, we talked about the struggle for power and counter-struggle for power in the brigade, from China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism, to the class enemies in the brigade trying to counter-struggle for power. The elderly people listened and became more and more indignant, and many people, pounding their canes, said: "China's Khrushchev is a man with a sore on his head and pus in his feet, rotten to the core. He is the mortal enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants! China's Khrushchev is just like the landlords in our brigade. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and socialism, we will fight to the death!"

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are closest to the hearts of old poor peasants, and class struggle can best arouse their revolutionary enthusiasm. The elderly's understanding of revolutionary criticism is constantly improving, and their awareness of participating in revolutionary criticism is becoming higher and higher. To facilitate these elderly people to join the battle, we adopted more flexible and varied forms of criticism, such as small meetings, street meetings, and field meetings, fully giving play to the special role of the elderly in the revolutionary criticism. They are the victims of the old society, and they have the deepest understanding of the bitterness of having no power and the difficulty of seizing power. They participate in the revolutionary criticism, and they can best hit the vital points of China's Khrushchev; they are witnesses to the countless crimes of class enemies, and they fight together with the young people, criticizing the most lively and fiercely, and the masses are educated the deepest; they are the "living archives" of the pseudo-bandit period, and they actively join the battle, allowing us to quickly expose a handful of long-hidden counter-revolutionaries, and more accurately and fiercely strike a handful of class enemies.

After the revolutionary criticism was launched, it was once unable to closely combine with the actual class struggle of the unit. What should be done in this case?

First, remove the "obstacles" in the minds of the cadres

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Whether the rural revolutionary criticism movement can be carried out step by step depends on whether the cadres dare to lead the way.

The black goods of China's Khrushchev's "three independences and one contract" have deeply poisoned our brigade. In 1961, a stubborn capitalist-roader in our brigade, under the name of "reclamation," occupied more than fifteen mu of collective farmland. Under his influence, the entire village had more than three hundred mu of "reclaimed land." In theory, the deeper the poison, the more there is to criticize. However, at the beginning, some production teams "only fired high-altitude artillery, not machine guns." When the masses linked up with the actual situation of their own teams, some cadres led them "outside the circle," making the revolutionary criticism dull and tasteless. What was the reason? The brigade, after in-depth investigation, found that some cadres were afraid to link it to themselves, afraid to bring fire to their own bodies. The head of the seventh production team, Sun Wenyuan, last year arbitrarily destroyed the state's planting plan and planted sixteen mu of watermelons in collective land. When the watermelons ripened, they were sold at high prices in the free market. In the criticism movement, he carried a heavy "burden" and dared not lead the way. He thought that he was "half-paralyzed" and could not say that others were "paralyzed," and the masses would criticize him in the end. These thoughts became the "obstacles" in the criticism. To solve this problem, the brigade specially held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for cadres. They studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and related teachings such as "put down your burden and start the machine," making everyone realize: We are all victims of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line and should actively participate in the revolutionary criticism to thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev. Our mistakes can only be deeply recognized and thoroughly corrected through revolutionary criticism. On the basis of improving ideological awareness, the brigade cadres took the lead in exposing their private thoughts in the revolutionary criticism. I first examined my past mistake of accepting the error of a small group of capitalist-roaders in the county and district committees in Dongliushan to carry out counter-revolutionary economism. The person in charge of the brigade, Comrade Wang Shouzheng, also examined his mistake of eating too much and participating in the felling of collective trees. The brigade cadres took the lead in exposing their "private" thoughts, and the thoughts of the production team cadres were relieved by half. The comrades who originally had thought burdens all actively examined their mistakes in the study class. Comrade Sun Wenyuan of the seventh production team said: "Last year, I destroyed the state's planting plan, used collective farmland to plant watermelons, and then sold them in the free market. This is a disguised expansion of the peasants' private plots. This capitalist mode of operation is a concrete manifestation of being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's 'public-private combination' and 'three independences and one contract'." Under the leadership of Comrade Sun Wenyuan, the cadres of the seventh team also actively examined their mistakes. The peasants said: "The responsibility is not entirely on the cadres, we also have mistakes."

The cadres' minds were freed from the "burden," just like Sun Wukong was freed from the "golden fillet," and they worked more boldly, with more enthusiasm to lead the movement. The revolutionary criticism movement immediately launched a new high tide.

The target of the revolutionary criticism should always be aimed at China's Khrushchev and his agents. When the masses are mobilized, sometimes the gun barrel deviates. What should be done in this case?

Be good at using the Party's policies to arm the masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party, and all levels of leadership must pay full attention and never be careless." In the revolutionary criticism movement, if the gun position is not correct and the enemy and friend are not distinguished, it will inevitably confuse the two types of contradictions. When encountering such a situation, the Party's policies should be used to guide the masses to correct the gun position immediately.

Our brigade has a mass organization that, under the deception and manipulation of class enemies, has done many bad things. When criticizing China's Khrushchev's line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" of the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary masses were very indignant. Some said: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Regardless of whether it was in front or behind the scenes, as long as they did bad things, we will wipe them out." Others said: "In the past, they pointed their guns at us, and now that we have won, we should also let them taste the bitterness of the dictatorship of the proletariat." The brigade analyzed this trend and believed that our fighting target should always be aimed at a small handful of class enemies and never treat the deceived class brothers as class enemies. To make the broad masses strictly grasp the Party's policies, we specially held a study class for the heads of revolutionary mass organizations and all brigade and production team cadres. In the study class, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions and specifically analyzed the various aspects of the situation of this organization. Everyone realized: The vast majority of the masses in this organization are good. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses who have been deceived, and we should enthusiastically help them quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Thus, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's works with them, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism together, encouraged them to voluntarily examine their mistakes, and expose the bad guys.

For the heads of this organization who did more bad things, we always strictly demanded them, clarified right and wrong, and started from the desire for unity. At first, these few people were tense, and some even could not eat or sleep. Based on this situation, in the study class, we not only did not rush to ask them to examine themselves, but we also took the lead in exposing our private thoughts and sincerely asked them to give us advice. At the same time, we also carried out reminiscences of bitterness with them, guiding them to improve their class awareness. They were moved to tears and said: "The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat are good in every way, and they are good in listening to Chairman Mao's teachings and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and will firmly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." From then on, they voluntarily examined their serious mistakes and at the same time exposed the evil facts of the class enemies manipulating behind the scenes. The living facts of class struggle were laid out, further educating the broad masses of the people, and everyone deeply felt: "The lid of class struggle is really not opened until you know, and once opened, it scares you. The root of evil is still in a small handful of class enemies, and we should always aim our guns at them." From then on, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the deceived masses held hands tightly, aimed more accurately, fired more fiercely, and the class enemies were more isolated.

To carry out the revolutionary criticism is to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism. After the revolutionary criticism, if China's Khrushchev's black goods reappear, what should be done?

Fight selfishness and dig out the roots of revisionism

Our brigade has criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods many times. However, these black goods have reappeared in some places. For example, after we criticized China's Khrushchev's "three independences and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives," some teams ignored the state's planting plan and wanted to plant watermelons in collective land; some teams in the drought struggle again showed signs of valuing foreign things over domestic things and asking for help from above; some people would calculate personal gains when encountering things, and so on. Why did China's Khrushchev's poison reappear after we criticized his revisionist black goods? We studied this problem with Chairman Mao's teachings on "the transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation" and "if political work among the peasants is slightly relaxed, capitalist tendencies will surge." We realized: Revisionism is the tree, selfishness is the root, and if the root of selfishness is not removed, the tree of revisionism cannot be uprooted. In the past, we did not combine criticism of revisionism with fighting selfishness well, so China's Khrushchev's poison reappeared in a disguised form. The problem was found, and on the basis of unifying thoughts, we used the study class as a battlefield, with the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the guideline, fiercely fought against selfishness, fiercely dug out the roots of revisionism, and closely combined fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism. In various types of study classes, we organized cadres and peasants to repeatedly study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using the basic views of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a mirror and the three shining images of Zhang Zide, White and Old Fool as examples, thoroughly exposing the harm of selfishness, making selfishness stink, and highly praising the three shining images. In the process of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the cadres and masses studied one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticized one of the fallacies of revisionism, and fiercely fought against one of their selfish thoughts, with good results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will turn into material forces to transform society and the world." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, after the revolutionary criticism, have become more intimate with Chairman Mao, and their enthusiasm for reading Chairman Mao's books has increased. Everyone strives to be a pioneer in seizing the revolution and a model in promoting production. The whole village has emerged a large number of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought.
