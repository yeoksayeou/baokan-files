Our brigade in the revolutionary criticism is how to grasp living thoughts?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's entire political tasks cannot be completed." Our Dongliushan Brigade, during the revolutionary criticism, because we grasped the ideological education of the masses and cadres, and promptly used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and arm the masses, every time we solve a problem of cognition with Mao Zedong Thought, the people gain a great impetus, their political awareness is greatly enhanced, and the revolutionary criticism advances a step further. We deeply feel that highlighting proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to promptly remove the "roadblocks" in people's minds, is a key issue in carrying out the revolutionary criticism in depth and over a long period.

When young and strong laborers actively participate in the revolutionary criticism, what should we do if some elderly people cannot quickly join in?

Send Mao Zedong's latest instructions to their hearts

"Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." In the revolutionary criticism, we pay special attention to giving full play to their role in charging into battle. However, some elderly laborers, especially those who are illiterate and have never spoken at public meetings, often cannot quickly join in. The brigade leadership, after investigation and research, seriously analyzed and recognized that most of these elderly people were exploited in the old society, unable to go to school, and have been "fighting hard in the countryside." Some people were activists during the democratic revolution period, and they know the most about past class struggles, have the most to say, and are the most authoritative. Why can't they keep up in the criticism? The main reason is that some elderly people, because they attend fewer meetings, do not fully understand the importance of revolutionary criticism, think they are uneducated, have low theoretical level, cannot compare with the quick-witted and eloquent young people, and mistakenly believe that revolutionary criticism is the business of educated young people. Moreover, our criticism methods are mechanical and rigid, with more large meetings and fewer small meetings, and it is also inconvenient for elderly people to participate in the criticism, thus some elderly people have the phenomenon of "spectating."

A ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We targeted these living thoughts of the elderly, organized them to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism" and "peasants in communes should also criticize the bourgeoisie," to raise their awareness of revolutionary criticism. We also selected young people with good thoughts and learning to be tutors, specially helping the elderly to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions; invited the elderly to talk about their past experiences of class struggle; conducted reminiscences of bitterness and sweetness, held elderly people's symposiums and criticism meetings. In addition, we also adopted methods such as on-site visits and reminiscences and comparisons to mobilize thoughts. This year in mid-June, we used carts to take more than sixty elderly people who had difficulty walking to the Beisha Forestry Brigade for a visit. When they saw that what was once a vast expanse of sand had now become an endless windbreak forest and countless fruit trees, they were all smiling and happy. They excitedly said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to take the socialist road, we would never have dreamed that this wasteland would become so good in the past." They excitedly shed tears of joy and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!" At this time, we led them to visit while explaining the history of class struggle in the Beisha River afforestation "three rises and three falls" over the years. From the afforestation and sabotage of afforestation, we talked about the struggle for power and counter-struggle for power in the brigade, from China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism, to the class enemies in the brigade trying to counter-struggle for power. The elderly people listened and became more and more indignant, and many people, pounding their canes, said: "China's Khrushchev is a man with a sore on his head and pus in his feet, rotten to the core. He is the mortal enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants! China's Khrushchev is just like the landlords in our brigade. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and socialism, we will fight to the death!"

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are closest to the hearts of old poor peasants, and class struggle can best arouse their revolutionary enthusiasm. The elderly's understanding of revolutionary criticism is constantly improving, and their awareness of participating in revolutionary criticism is becoming higher and higher. To facilitate these elderly people to join the battle, we adopted more flexible and varied forms of criticism, such as small meetings, street meetings, and field meetings, fully giving play to the special role of the elderly in the revolutionary criticism. They are the victims of the old society, and they have the deepest understanding of the bitterness of having no power and the difficulty of seizing power. They participate in the revolutionary criticism, and they can best hit the vital points of China's Khrushchev; they are witnesses to the countless crimes of class enemies, and they fight together with the young people, criticizing the most lively and fiercely, and the masses are educated the deepest; they are the "living archives" of the pseudo-bandit period, and they actively join the battle, allowing us to quickly expose a handful of long-hidden counter-revolutionaries, and more accurately and fiercely strike a handful of class enemies.

After the revolutionary criticism was launched, it was once unable to closely combine with the actual class struggle of the unit. What should be done in this case?

First, remove the "obstacles" in the minds of the cadres

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Whether the rural revolutionary criticism movement can be carried out step by step depends on whether the cadres dare to lead the way.

The black goods of China's Khrushchev's "three independences and one contract" have deeply poisoned our brigade. In 1961, a stubborn capitalist-roader in our brigade, under the name of "reclamation," occupied more than fifteen mu of collective farmland. Under his influence, the entire village had more than three hundred mu of "reclaimed land." In theory, the deeper the poison, the more there is to criticize. However, at the beginning, some production teams "only fired high-altitude artillery, not machine guns." When the masses linked up with the actual situation of their own teams, some cadres led them "outside the circle," making the revolutionary criticism dull and tasteless. What was the reason? The brigade, after in-depth investigation, found that some cadres were afraid to link it to themselves, afraid to bring fire to their own bodies. The head of the seventh production team, Sun Wenyuan, last year arbitrarily destroyed the state's planting plan and planted sixteen mu of watermelons in collective land. When the watermelons ripened, they were sold at high prices in the free market. In the criticism movement, he carried a heavy "burden" and dared not lead the way. He thought that he was "half-paralyzed" and could not say that others were "paralyzed," and the masses would criticize him in the end. These thoughts became the "obstacles" in the criticism. To solve this problem, the brigade specially held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for cadres. They studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and related teachings such as "put down your burden and start the machine," making everyone realize: We are all victims of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line and should actively participate in the revolutionary criticism to thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev. Our mistakes can only be deeply recognized and thoroughly corrected through revolutionary criticism. On the basis of improving ideological awareness, the brigade cadres took the lead in exposing their private thoughts in the revolutionary criticism. I first examined my past mistake of accepting the error of a small group of capitalist-roaders in the county and district committees in Dongliushan to carry out counter-revolutionary economism. The person in charge of the brigade, Comrade Wang Shouzheng, also examined his mistake of eating too much and participating in the felling of collective trees. The brigade cadres took the lead in exposing their "private" thoughts, and the thoughts of the production team cadres were relieved by half. The comrades who originally had thought burdens all actively examined their mistakes in the study class. Comrade Sun Wenyuan of the seventh production team said: "Last year, I destroyed the state's planting plan, used collective farmland to plant watermelons, and then sold them in the free market. This is a disguised expansion of the peasants' private plots. This capitalist mode of operation is a concrete manifestation of being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's 'public-private combination' and 'three independences and one contract'." Under the leadership of Comrade Sun Wenyuan, the cadres of the seventh team also actively examined their mistakes. The peasants said: "The responsibility is not entirely on the cadres, we also have mistakes."

The cadres' minds were freed from the "burden," just like Sun Wukong was freed from the "golden fillet," and they worked more boldly, with more enthusiasm to lead the movement. The revolutionary criticism movement immediately launched a new high tide.

The target of the revolutionary criticism should always be aimed at China's Khrushchev and his agents. When the masses are mobilized, sometimes the gun barrel deviates. What should be done in this case?

Be good at using the Party's policies to arm the masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party, and all levels of leadership must pay full attention and never be careless." In the revolutionary criticism movement, if the gun position is not correct and the enemy and friend are not distinguished, it will inevitably confuse the two types of contradictions. When encountering such a situation, the Party's policies should be used to guide the masses to correct the gun position immediately.

Our brigade has a mass organization that, under the deception and manipulation of class enemies, has done many bad things. When criticizing China's Khrushchev's line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" of the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary masses were very indignant. Some said: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Regardless of whether it was in front or behind the scenes, as long as they did bad things, we will wipe them out." Others said: "In the past, they pointed their guns at us, and now that we have won, we should also let them taste the bitterness of the dictatorship of the proletariat." The brigade analyzed this trend and believed that our fighting target should always be aimed at a small handful of class enemies and never treat the deceived class brothers as class enemies. To make the broad masses strictly grasp the Party's policies, we specially held a study class for the heads of revolutionary mass organizations and all brigade and production team cadres. In the study class, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions and specifically analyzed the various aspects of the situation of this organization. Everyone realized: The vast majority of the masses in this organization are good. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses who have been deceived, and we should enthusiastically help them quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Thus, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's works with them, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism together, encouraged them to voluntarily examine their mistakes, and expose the bad guys.

For the heads of this organization who did more bad things, we always strictly demanded them, clarified right and wrong, and started from the desire for unity. At first, these few people were tense, and some even could not eat or sleep. Based on this situation, in the study class, we not only did not rush to ask them to examine themselves, but we also took the lead in exposing our private thoughts and sincerely asked them to give us advice. At the same time, we also carried out reminiscences of bitterness with them, guiding them to improve their class awareness. They were moved to tears and said: "The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat are good in every way, and they are good in listening to Chairman Mao's teachings and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and will firmly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." From then on, they voluntarily examined their serious mistakes and at the same time exposed the evil facts of the class enemies manipulating behind the scenes. The living facts of class struggle were laid out, further educating the broad masses of the people, and everyone deeply felt: "The lid of class struggle is really not opened until you know, and once opened, it scares you. The root of evil is still in a small handful of class enemies, and we should always aim our guns at them." From then on, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the deceived masses held hands tightly, aimed more accurately, fired more fiercely, and the class enemies were more isolated.

To carry out the revolutionary criticism is to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism. After the revolutionary criticism, if China's Khrushchev's black goods reappear, what should be done?

Fight selfishness and dig out the roots of revisionism

Our brigade has criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods many times. However, these black goods have reappeared in some places. For example, after we criticized China's Khrushchev's "three independences and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives," some teams ignored the state's planting plan and wanted to plant watermelons in collective land; some teams in the drought struggle again showed signs of valuing foreign things over domestic things and asking for help from above; some people would calculate personal gains when encountering things, and so on. Why did China's Khrushchev's poison reappear after we criticized his revisionist black goods? We studied this problem with Chairman Mao's teachings on "the transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation" and "if political work among the peasants is slightly relaxed, capitalist tendencies will surge." We realized: Revisionism is the tree, selfishness is the root, and if the root of selfishness is not removed, the tree of revisionism cannot be uprooted. In the past, we did not combine criticism of revisionism with fighting selfishness well, so China's Khrushchev's poison reappeared in a disguised form. The problem was found, and on the basis of unifying thoughts, we used the study class as a battlefield, with the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the guideline, fiercely fought against selfishness, fiercely dug out the roots of revisionism, and closely combined fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism. In various types of study classes, we organized cadres and peasants to repeatedly study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using the basic views of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a mirror and the three shining images of Zhang Zide, White and Old Fool as examples, thoroughly exposing the harm of selfishness, making selfishness stink, and highly praising the three shining images. In the process of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the cadres and masses studied one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticized one of the fallacies of revisionism, and fiercely fought against one of their selfish thoughts, with good results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will turn into material forces to transform society and the world." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, after the revolutionary criticism, have become more intimate with Chairman Mao, and their enthusiasm for reading Chairman Mao's books has increased. Everyone strives to be a pioneer in seizing the revolution and a model in promoting production. The whole village has emerged a large number of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought.

    我们大队在革命大批判中是如何抓活思想的？
    河北省临西县东留善固大队党支部书记　吕玉兰
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们东留善固大队在革命的大批判中，由于抓了群众和干部的思想教育，及时用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众、武装群众，所以，每当用毛泽东思想解决一个认识问题时，人民群众就得到一次大发动，政治觉悟就有一次大提高，革命的大批判就向前推进一步。我们深深感到，突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想及时扫除思想上的“拦路虎”，这是深入持久地开展革命大批判的一个关键问题。
    当青壮年社员积极投入革命大批判以后，有些老年人不能很快上阵，怎么办？
    把毛主席最新指示送到他们心坎上
    “青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”在革命大批判中，我们特别注意发挥他们冲锋陷阵的积极作用。可是，有些老年社员特别是那些不识字，没在大会上说过话的老年人，往往不能很快跟着上阵。大队领导班子经过调查研究以后，认真分析，认识到这些老年人多数是在旧社会当牛做马、上不起学的贫下中农，他们在“乡村中一向苦战奋斗”。有些人在民主革命时期是积极分子，对过去的阶级斗争感受最深，情况知道得最多，最有发言权。为什么他们在大批判中跟不上阵呢？主要原因是，有些老年人因为参加会议少，对革命大批判的重要意义认识不足，觉得自己没文化，理论水平低，比不上青年人心灵口快，能写会说，误认为革命大批判是有文化的青年人的事。再加上我们的批判方法机械呆板，大会多，小会少，也不便老年人参加批判，这就出现了一些老年人“观阵”的现象。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们针对这些老年人的活思想，组织他们学习毛主席关于“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”和公社农民“也要批判资产阶级”的教导，提高他们对革命大批判的认识。我们还挑选思想好、学习好的青年人当辅导员，专门帮助老年人学习毛主席的最新指示；请老年人谈过去阶级斗争的经历；进行忆苦思甜，召开老年人座谈会、批判会。另外，我们还采用现场参观，回忆对比等办法进行思想发动。如今年六月中旬，我们用排子车把六十多位走动不便的老大爷、老大娘拉到北沙林业队去参观。当他们看到过去是一片白茫茫的沙滩，现在是一眼看不到头的防风林、数不清的果木树时，个个喜笑颜开。他们激动地说：“要不是毛主席他老人家领导咱们走社会主义道路，过去这荒沙野坡，做梦也没想到变得这样好。”他们激动地流着热泪高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”这时，我们一面带他们参观，一面讲十几年北沙河造林“三起三落”的阶级斗争史。从造林和破坏造林的斗争说到大队夺权和反夺权的斗争，从中国赫鲁晓夫大搞资本主义复辟，说到队里的阶级敌人大搞反夺权。老年人越听越气愤，许多人气得敲着拐棍说：“中国赫鲁晓夫是头顶上长疮，脚心里流脓，坏透了。他是咱贫下中农的死对头！中国赫鲁晓夫和咱队的地主一模一样。谁反对毛主席，反对社会主义，豁上老命也得跟他干到底！”
    毛主席的最新指示同老贫农最贴心，阶级斗争最能激发他们的革命热情。老年人对革命大批判的认识不断提高，参加革命大批判的自觉性越来越高。为便于这些老年人参战，我们更多地采取了小型会、街头会、田间地头会等灵活多样的批判形式，充分发挥了老年人在革命大批判中的特殊作用。他们是旧社会的受害者，对没权之苦，夺权之难体会最深，他们参加革命大批判，最能打中中国赫鲁晓夫的要害；他们是阶级敌人累累罪行的见证人，他们同青年人结合起来一起战斗，批得最活、最狠，群众受教育最深；他们是伪顽时期的“活档案”，他们主动参战，使我们很快挖出了一小撮隐藏多年的反革命分子，更加稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命大批判开展起来以后，一度不能很好地同本单位阶级斗争实际紧密结合起来。出现这种现象怎么办？
    首先要去掉干部思想上的“挡头”
    毛主席教导我们说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”农村革命大批判运动，能不能步步深入地开展下去，关键在于干部敢不敢往前领。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”黑货，在我们大队流毒很深。一九六一年，我们大队的一个顽固走资派就以“开荒”为名，侵占集体耕地十五亩之多。在他的影响下，全村“开荒地”就达三百多亩。照理说，流毒越深越有批头。可是开初，有的生产队“光放高射炮，不打机关枪”。群众一联系本队的实际情况，有的干部就往“圈外”引，使革命大批判枯燥无味。原因在哪里呢？大队经过深入调查，发现有的干部怕联系到自己，怕引火烧身。第七生产队长孙文延去年擅自破坏了国家种植计划，在集体地里种了十六亩西瓜。西瓜熟了又高价在自由市场上出售。在大批判运动中，背上沉重的“包袱”，总是不敢往前领。认为自己“半身不遂”，没理再说别人“瘫痪”，群众批来批去会批到自己头上来。这些思想就成了大批判的“挡头”。为了解决这个问题，大队专门举办了干部毛泽东思想学习班。学习了毛主席一系列最新指示和“放下包袱，开动机器”等有关教导，使大家认识到：我们都是中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的受害者，更应该积极参加革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。我们的错误，也只有通过革命大批判才能认识深刻，改得彻底。在提高思想认识的基础上，大队干部在革命大批判中，带头亮私斗私。我首先检查了自己过去接受地、县委一小撮走资派在东留善固大搞反革命经济主义的错误。大队负责人王守增同志也检查了多吃多占以及参与砍伐集体树木的错误。大队干部带头把“私”字一亮，生产队干部的思想顾虑就解除了一半。原来有思想包袱的同志都主动在学习班里检查了自己的错误。第七生产队长孙文延说：“去年我破坏国家种植计划，利用集体耕地种西瓜，又到自由市场上去卖，这是变相扩大了社员自留地。这种资本主义经营方式，就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘大公有私’、‘三自一包’流毒的具体表现。”在孙文延同志带动下，第七队的干部，也主动作了检查。社员说：“责任不全在干部身上，我们也有错误。”
    干部思想上丢掉了“包袱”，就象孙悟空解脱了“金箍咒”，工作大胆了，领导运动的劲头更足了。革命大批判运动立即掀起了新的高潮。
    革命大批判的矛头应该始终对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人。当群众发动起来之后，有时炮口偏了怎么办？
    要善于运用党的政策武装群众
    毛主席教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”在革命大批判运动中，如果炮位不正，分不清敌友，就势必混淆两类不同性质的矛盾。遇到这种情况，就要立即用党的政策引导群众把炮位矫正过来。
    我们大队有一个群众组织，因受了阶级敌人蒙蔽与操纵，干了不少坏事。在批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线时，革命群众对他们非常气愤。有的说：“杀人的偿命，欠债的还钱。不管他幕前幕后，只要做过坏事的，我们就一锅端。”也有的说：“过去他们把矛头指向我们，现在我们胜利了，也得叫他们尝尝无产阶级专政的厉害。”大队分析了这个苗头，认为我们的斗争矛头应该始终对准一小撮阶级敌人，绝不能把受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟当作阶级敌人来打。为了使广大群众严格掌握党的政策，我们专门举办了革命群众组织头头和全体大队、生产队干部的学习班。在学习班里认真学习了毛主席关于正确区分和处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导，具体分析了这个组织的各方面的情况。大家认识到：这个组织中的群众绝大多数都是好的。无产阶级革命派同广大受蒙蔽的群众没有根本利害冲突，我们应该热情地帮助他们迅速回到毛主席革命路线上来。于是，无产阶级革命派便热情地同他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，鼓励他们自觉地检查错误，揭发坏人。
    对这个组织中办坏事较多的头头，我们始终是既严格要求，弄清是非，又从团结愿望出发。起初，这几个人思想紧张，甚至有的吃不下饭，睡不着觉。根据这种情况，在学习班里，我们不但没有急于叫他们作检查，反而我们带头亮私斗私，诚心地要他们给我们提意见。同时，还同他们一起开展忆苦活动，引导他们提高阶级觉悟。他们感动地流着热泪说：“无产阶级革命派千好万好，就是好在听毛主席的教导，照毛主席的指示办事上。我们一定不辜负无产阶级革命派的希望，坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来。”从此，他们主动检查自己的严重错误，同时，还揭发了阶级敌人在幕后指挥的罪恶事实。活生生的阶级斗争事实一摆，进一步教育了广大人民群众，大家深有体会地说：“阶级斗争的盖子真是不揭不知道，一揭吓一跳，原来坏根还是扎在一小撮阶级敌人身上，我们应该始终把炮口对准他们。”从此，无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽的群众握紧了手，炮口对得更准了，火力更猛了，阶级敌人更孤立了。
    开展革命大批判是要彻底肃清修正主义流毒。经过革命大批判，中国赫鲁晓夫黑货重新露头怎么办？
    斗私字刨修根
    我们大队对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，进行了多次批判。但是，这些黑货在某些地方又有露头。比如，我们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等黑货后，有的队不顾国家种植计划，要在集体地里种西瓜；有的队在抗旱斗争中又冒出了重洋轻土、向上伸手的苗头；有的人遇事就打个人主义小算盘，等等。为什么我们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑货，他的流毒又在起作用呢？我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”，“稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来”的教导。认识到：修是树，私是根，私根挖不掉，修树刨不倒。前一段，我们因为批修与斗私结合得不好，所以中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒又以改头换面的方式表现出来。问题找到了，在统一思想的基础上，我们以学习班为阵地，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，狠斗私字，狠挖修根，把斗私同批修紧密结合起来。在各种类型的学习班里，组织干部、社员反复学习“老三篇”，以“老三篇”的基本观点为镜子，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象为榜样，大摆私字的危害，把私字搞得臭臭的，把三个光辉形象树得高高的。干部、群众在斗私批修过程中，学习毛主席的一条语录，批判修正主义的一个谬论，狠斗自己的一分私心，效果很好。
    毛主席教导我们：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”广大贫下中农、干部经过革命大批判，对毛主席更亲了，读毛主席书的劲头更大了。人人争当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。全村涌现出大批活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。
