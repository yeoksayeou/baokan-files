Chairman Mao has pointed out a bright path for intellectuals. The Beijing Instrument Factory held a study session on Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

"Most or the majority of students trained in old schools can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they need to be led by the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers should re-educate them to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the only correct direction for intellectuals to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. To better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the old workers and technical personnel of the Beijing Instrument Factory held an all-night study session to learn from Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Participants in the study session unanimously agreed that at this crucial moment when the nation is striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has pointed out a bright path for broad intellectuals to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. It is a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese working class to transform intellectuals in their own image and build a strong contingent of intellectuals serving the proletariat. Everyone expressed their determination to seriously study, enthusiastically propagate, resolutely implement, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The Struggle Between Two Lines

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its own worldview." For a long time, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines on the issue of building what kind of contingent of intellectuals. As early as 1939, in his article "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing to and actually unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's instructions pointed out a path for intellectuals to unite with workers and peasants. This is a bright path for the revolutionization and proletarianization of intellectuals.

In contrast, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents vigorously advocated and implemented a revisionist line. They did not allow intellectuals to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, but instead led intellectuals down the white-specialist road, down the dark path of capitalism.

This struggle between the two lines also exists in the Beijing Instrument Factory. A small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory actively promoted the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line, causing the technical power in the factory to be in the hands of bourgeois technical "authorities," separating technicians from workers. The technicians in the factory all lived in a small building. Workers called it the "technical building." Technicians spent all day in this small building, looking up materials, checking data, and designing in isolation. Because technicians did not understand production practice, the products they designed did not meet production requirements and were often scrapped. A technician made a mistake in the design, confusing 6 for 9, resulting in a batch of products becoming scrap, piled up. Workers saw this and felt heartbroken, their hard work was in vain, and national resources were wasted. Workers could no longer bear it and called the technicians as soon as they found a problem in the drawings. However, after calling a few times, the technicians still did not show up. Workers said that at that time, inviting technicians to the workshop was like "inviting Zhuge Liang three times." In fact, the real Zhuge Liang was not those technicians who did not go to the workshop, but the old workers with rich practical experience.

Participants in the study session, through their own experiences, proved this point. Some technicians, as soon as they left the drawings, could not even tell the front from the back of a blade and had to ask the workers. Such jokes were not just one or two. This fact itself proves that intellectuals, if they are detached from reality and do not unite with workers and peasants, will achieve nothing. Intellectuals can only go to the masses of workers and peasants, thoroughly transform themselves, and then play their due role.

At that time, some college graduates who had just come from school also actively requested to go to the workshop to work with the workers. However, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois "authorities" in the factory did not allow them to do so, saying that "college students participating in physical labor is a waste, it's better to read more foreign materials." In this way, the technicians in the factory were seriously detached from production practice and from the masses of workers.

Self-Consciously Accepting the Re-Education of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Most or the majority of students trained in old schools can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers." Participants in the study session unanimously said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions hit the nail on the head. Most intellectuals want to be revolutionary and are willing to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents implemented a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines in schools and factories, doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the unity of technicians with workers, peasants, and soldiers. In schools, they promoted "professor-led schools" and advocated the idea of "only reading is high." They elevated some bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and "scholars" to the podium, spreading the poison of revisionism, feudalism, and capitalism, and peddling some trash picked from ancient books and foreign books. Some young students were poisoned by bourgeois ideas, spending all day reading books, pursuing personal fame and fortune, detached from the masses of workers and peasants, and detached from social practice. In factories, the Chinese Khrushchev promoted "expert-led factories," and the technical power was still monopolized by bourgeois technical authorities. They made some rules and regulations, separating workers from technicians. They encouraged young people to take the white-specialist road, making technicians unable to come into contact with production practice, spending all day in a pile of foreign materials, copying foreign things.

All hatred should be directed at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The great proletarian cultural revolution liberated broad intellectuals from the shackles of the revisionist line, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they embarked on the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our factory, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee and with the help of the stationed PLA, streamlined the organization and reformed unreasonable rules and regulations. In April this year, more than 100 technicians in the entire factory, the vast majority, went down to the workshops to work and study with the workers.

In the short few months of uniting with the workers, the technicians received great education. They said: The workers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, their deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao, and the proletariat's selfless and noble qualities deeply moved us. When trial-producing the new product 300 single crystal furnace, the worker teachers always encouraged us. They were not afraid of failure, not afraid of hard work, and worked with us to solve difficulties together. After repeated trials, the task was finally completed successfully. In the trial production process, there were many key issues that were solved only after technicians and old workers discussed them together. The technicians who participated in the trial production all said: "If we did not unite with the workers, many problems in design and technology would be unsolvable." Through uniting with the workers, technicians increased their practical experience and knowledge, and their thinking also improved greatly. They all felt that the work of the past few years or more than ten years had never been as fruitful as these few months of uniting with the workers. A designer had a deep understanding and said: "For more than ten years, I designed some products in isolation. This time, I completed the trial production task with the workers, and I felt that in the past more than ten years, I had not done any real work, it was very empty. Only now, uniting with the workers, I began to truly contribute my strength to the proletarian cause." The workers' selfless and noble qualities also made them feel that their past pursuit of fame and fortune, love of face, fear of responsibility, and other bourgeois ideas were very dirty.

Participants in the study session said that through this practice, they deeply felt that in the past, due to the poisoning of the revisionist line, their minds were filled with more or less bourgeois ideas, and these poisons must be thoroughly eliminated. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for us. We must follow the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao! Resolutely take the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers, self-consciously accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and use the proletarian worldview to transform the bourgeois ideas in our minds.

Welcome Intellectuals to the Masses of Workers and Peasants

The old workers who participated in the study session all said unanimously: Chairman Mao's latest instructions represent the voice of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The actual situation in our factory fully proves the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Except for a very small number, most technicians can unite with workers. After streamlining the organization, technicians went down to the workshops and worked with us workers. We wanted to carry out some technological innovations, and they also actively supported us. In the past, when we wanted to innovate, we did not know how to draw, and we had to run to the "technical building" to ask the technicians. Now, the technicians are right next to us, discussing together, and many problems are solved in time.

For the bourgeois ideas in the minds of technicians, we also enthusiastically help them overcome and help them study Chairman Mao's works, eliminating their ideological concerns. Some technicians had concerns and burdens when they went down to the workshops, fearing loss of face. We studied the "Three Articles" with them and helped them put down their airs. Workers are very welcoming to technicians coming to the workshops. During the streamlining of personnel, some technicians had concerns, fearing that they would have to do both design and technology in the workshops and that they could not handle it. We told them: "Don't worry, we will help solve the technical problems." We helped them overcome the "fear" and went down to the workshops. We also helped some young workers seriously study the important editorial notes in the "Red Flag" magazine, making them realize that the workers' class leading everything is a great historical mission given to us by Chairman Mao. We must grasp the various policies of the proletariat and not discriminate against technicians who go down to the workshops. We must use the proletarian worldview and Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate them and enthusiastically help them overcome bourgeois ideas.

### 毛主席给知识分子指出了光明大道  北京仪器厂学习毛主席最新指示座谈会纪要

    毛主席给知识分子指出了光明大道
    北京仪器厂学习毛主席最新指示座谈会纪要
    “从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的这一最新指示，指明了知识分子与工农兵相结合的唯一正确的方向。为了更好地贯彻执行毛主席的这一最新指示，北京仪器厂的老工人和技术人员连夜举行座谈会，学习毛主席的最新指示。
    参加座谈会的同志们一致认为：在全国夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，毛主席的最新指示的发表，给广大知识分子指出了一条与工农兵相结合的光明大道，它是我国工人阶级按照自己的面貌改造知识分子，建立一支为无产阶级服务的知识分子队伍的强大思想武器。大家表示一定要认真学习、热情宣传、坚决执行和勇敢捍卫毛主席的最新指示。
        两条路线的激烈斗争
    毛主席指出：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”长期以来，在建立一支什么样的知识分子队伍的问题上，一直存在两条路线的激烈斗争。我们伟大的领袖毛主席早在一九三九年《青年运动的方向》一文中就指出：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛主席的指示，给知识分子指出了一条与工农相结合的道路。这是一条使知识分子革命化与劳动化的光明大道。
    与此相反，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，拚命鼓吹和推行一条修正主义的路线。他们不让知识分子和工农兵相结合，要把知识分子引上白专道路，引上资本主义的黑暗道路。
    这两条路线的斗争，在北京仪器厂也同样存在。厂里的一小撮走资派，积极推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，使厂里的技术大权掌握在资产阶级技术“权威”手里，把技术员和工人分开。厂里的技术人员都住在一座小楼里。工人们称它为“技术小楼”。技术员成天就钻在这小楼里，翻资料，查数据，闭门造车搞设计。因为技术员不了解生产实践，设计的产品不符合生产的要求，经常报废。有个技术员搞设计时，把数字搞错了，把6错成9，结果产品成批地变为废品，堆起来。工人看了好心疼，辛勤的劳动白费了，国家的物资浪费了。工人实在忍不住了，一发现图纸中有问题，就打电话找技术员。但是，三找两找，技术员依然不肯露面。工人说，那时候，请技术员下车间简直是“三请诸葛亮”。其实，真正的诸葛亮并不是那些不肯下车间的技术员，而是有丰富实践经验的老工人。
    参加座谈会的技术人员，以自己的切身体会，证明了这一点。有的技术员一离开图纸，连刀口的正反面也分不清，还是要请教工人。象这样的笑话并不止一件。这个事实本身就证明，知识分子脱离实际，不和工农相结合，必将一事无成。知识分子只有到工农群众中去，彻底改造自己，才能发挥应有的作用。
    当时，厂里一部分才从学校来的大学生，也曾积极地要求到车间去和工人一起劳动。但是，厂里的走资派和资产阶级“权威”却不让他们这样做，竟说什么：“大学生参加体力劳动是一种浪费，还是多看一些外文资料吧。”就这样，使厂里的技术员严重地脱离生产实践，脱离工人群众。
        自觉地接受工农兵的再教育
    毛主席指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的”。参加座谈的技术人员都一致表示，毛主席的这一最新指示说到我们的心坎里去了。大多数知识分子是要革命的，是愿意和工农兵相结合的，但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在学校和工厂推行了一整套反革命修正主义路线，千方百计阻挠和破坏技术人员和工农兵相结合。在学校里，他们推行“教授治校”，宣扬“唯有读书高”的思想，把一些资产阶级反动“权威”、“学者”，捧上讲坛，散布修正主义、封建主义和资本主义的毒素，贩卖一些从古书和外国书堆中拾来的破烂货。一些青年学生中了资产阶级思想的毒，整天啃书本，追求个人名利，脱离工农群众，脱离社会实践。在工厂里，中国赫鲁晓夫则推行“专家治厂”，依然是一些资产阶级技术权威垄断技术大权。他们搞了些条条框框，规章制度，把工人和技术人员分开。他们鼓励青年走白专道路，使技术人员不能接触生产实践，成天钻在外国资料堆里，照抄外国的东西。
    千仇万恨，应当集中在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的身上。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把广大知识分子从修正主义路线的束缚下解放出来，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的领导下，走上了和工农兵相结合的道路。我们厂在革命委员会的领导和驻厂解放军的帮助下，精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，今年四月，全厂一百多名技术员，绝大多数都下到车间和工人一起劳动，一起学习。
    在短短的几个月和工人相结合的过程中，技术人员受到了很大的教育。他们说：工人无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，和无产阶级大公无私的崇高品质，使我们深受感动。在试制新产品三○○单晶炉的时候，工人师傅总是鼓励我们。他们不怕失败，不怕劳累，和我们一起，共同解决难题。经过一次又一次的试验，最后终于胜利完成任务。在试制过程中，有许多关键问题，都是技术员和老工人一起商量才得到解决的。参加试制的技术人员都说：“要是不和工人相结合，许多设计和工艺中的问题，根本没法解决。”技术人员通过和工人结合，共同设计，不仅增加了实践经验和知识，思想也得到很大的提高。他们都感到，过去几年、十几年的工作，从来没有这几个月和工人相结合的收获大。有个设计员深有体会地说：“我十几年来设计的一些产品，都是闭门造车。这次和工人一起完成试制的任务，我才觉得过去的十几年，自己并没有做什么工作，非常的空虚。只有现在，和工人相结合，我才开始真正为无产阶级事业尽自己的一分力量。”工人阶级大公无私的高贵品质，也使他们感到过去争名利，爱面子，怕负责任等等资产阶级思想，非常肮脏。
    参加座谈的技术人员说，通过这段实践，我们深深感到，过去，由于受修正主义路线的毒害，脑子里多多少少装了一些资产阶级的东西，这些毒素必须彻底清除出去。毛主席的最新指示给我们指明了方向。我们一定沿着毛主席指出的光明大道前进！坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路，自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，用无产阶级世界观来改造自己头脑中的资产阶级思想。
      欢迎知识分子到工农群众中来
    参加座谈的老工人都一致地说：毛主席的最新指示代表我们广大工农兵的声音。从我们厂的实际情况完全证明了毛主席最新指示的无比英明和正确。技术人员除极少数外，大多数都是能够和工人结合的。自精简机构以后，技术员下到车间，和我们工人在一起了。我们想搞一些技术革新，他们也积极支持。过去，想搞革新，不会绘图，要跑到“技术小楼”上去请技术员。现在，技术员就在旁边，共同商量，很多问题就及时解决了。
    对于技术人员头脑中的资产阶级思想，我们也热情地帮助他们克服，帮助他们学习毛主席著作，消除他们的思想顾虑。有的技术员下车间时思想有顾虑，有包袱，怕丢面子。我们就和他一起学习“老三篇”，帮助他放下架子。工人是很欢迎技术员到车间来的。在精兵简政时，有些技术员思想有顾虑，怕到车间又是设计，又是工艺，自己搞不了。我们就对他们说：没关系，工艺问题我们帮助解决。帮助他们克服了“怕”字，下到了车间。我们还帮助一些青年工人认真学习《红旗》杂志的重要编者按，使他们认识到工人阶级领导一切，是毛主席赋予我们的伟大历史使命，我们一定要掌握好无产阶级的各项政策，不要歧视下车间的技术员，要用无产阶级的世界观，用毛泽东思想对他们进行再教育，热情帮助他们克服资产阶级思想。
