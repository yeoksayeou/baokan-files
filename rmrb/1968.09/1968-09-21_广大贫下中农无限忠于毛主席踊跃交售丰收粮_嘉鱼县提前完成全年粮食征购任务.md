The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Jiayu County, Hubei Province, with infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep proletarian feelings, have enthusiastically sold their harvested grain after achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer grain and early-middle season rice. Currently, this county has completed the state's annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule.

During the growth period of summer crops and early-middle season rice, Jiayu County experienced a rare drought in some areas, with rainfall only half of the previous years. The surging floodwaters of the Yangtze River also once threatened the growth of summer grain and early-middle season rice in this county. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the specific leadership of the county revolutionary committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members overcame severe drought and flood disasters, achieving a bumper harvest of summer grain and early-middle season rice.

In the grain procurement work, the Jiayu County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and seriously implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The committee led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to actively carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei and Jiayu in the grain procurement work. Through studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and revolutionary criticism and struggle, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members have been raised to an unprecedented level. With deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they have completed the annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule and victoriously.

    广大贫下中农无限忠于毛主席踊跃交售丰收粮
    嘉鱼县提前完成全年粮食征购任务
    新华社武汉十七日电  湖北省嘉鱼县广大贫下中农和社员群众，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，在取得夏粮和早中稻空前大丰收以后，踊跃交公粮卖余粮。目前这个县已经提前完成了国家全年的粮食征购任务。
    今年夏季作物和早中稻生长期间，嘉鱼县部分地区遇到了罕见的干旱，降雨量只有历年的一半，长江猛涨的洪水一度也威胁着这个县的夏粮和早中稻的生长。全县广大贫下中农和社员群众，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，在县革命委员会的具体领导下，战胜了严重的旱涝灾害，取得了夏粮和早中稻的大丰收。
    在粮食征购工作中，嘉鱼县革命委员会遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，坚持突出无产阶级政治，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想统帅粮食征购工作。革委会带领全县广大贫下中农积极开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北和嘉鱼地区的代理人在粮食征购工作中所推行的反革命修正主义路线。通过学习毛主席的一系列最新指示和革命大批判，广大贫下中农和社员群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，提前胜利完成了全年的粮食征购任务。
