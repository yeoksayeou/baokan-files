The Burmese Communist Party-led people's armed forces and various ethnic armed forces in Burma have bravely and intelligently struck the enemy in many places in Burma in July, achieving new victories one after another.

According to Burmese reactionary newspapers, the people's armed forces active in the Irrawaddy and Pegu regions sometimes concentrate more than a hundred superior forces to attack and besiege the reactionary military and police stationed in towns. They sometimes dispatch small teams to attack enemy police outposts and moving enemy forces, fighting back against the Burmese reactionaries who are at a loss.

On the morning of July 15, more than a hundred Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces, divided into three groups, attacked and entered the town of Kongwenyi in the Magway District, besieging the camp of about a hundred military and police from the 93rd Infantry Battalion and the police station, fighting for two hours.

On the evening of July 27, more than a hundred Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces, divided into two groups, attacked the town of Mawtin in the Magway District, severely striking the 93rd Infantry Battalion and reactionary police stationed there, and burning down a warehouse and two rice mills of the Burmese reactionary government. On the evening of July 28, another group of Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces attacked the reactionary military patrolling in the Magway District.

In the Pegu region, a Karen armed force attacked the 38th Infantry Battalion stationed near the town of Kanzeik in the Thayetmyo District, fighting for an hour and heavily striking the enemy. On the afternoon of July 20, the Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces ambushed a platoon of the 30th Infantry Battalion near the town of Padaung. On the evening of July 22, the Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces active in the area of Bingalagon in the Pegu District fought for an hour with the 57th Infantry Battalion and local reactionary armed forces ten miles west of the town, then safely retreated to the Pegu Mountains, foiling the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" plot. On the evening of July 28, a Karen armed force severely struck the 4th Company of the 35th Infantry Battalion patrolling along the railway in the Thayetmyo District.

In the capital of Shan State, Taunggyi, a small team of Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces attacked a police outpost in the evening of July 26. When the reactionary government dispatched military and police to pursue, this people's armed force had already safely retreated after annihilating the enemy.

In the Danai region of southeastern Burma, due to the active activities of the Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces, all land transportation in Thawle Township has been cut off. The Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces have blocked the roads from Thawle Township to Doyang Town and from Thawle to Byae Town. On July 26, a Burmese Communist Party people's armed force again blocked the road from Thawle Town to Yepyaw Town. In addition, on the evening of July 26, a Karen armed force attacked a police station near the town of Danpyawsi.

While fiercely striking the enemy, the Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces actively carry out mass work, suppressing reactionary officials and local tyrants who have committed heinous crimes.

In mid-July, in the forest area of the Pegu Mountains in the southern part of the Yebu District, the Burmese Communist Party people's armed forces arrested nine reactionary officials and local tyrants, confiscated their property, executed two of the ringleaders, and released the rest after education. Inspired by this revolutionary action of the Burmese people's armed forces, many forestry workers joined the people's armed forces.

    新华社十四日讯　仰光消息：缅甸共产党领导的人民武装和缅甸各民族人民武装，七月份在缅甸的许多地方英勇机智地打击敌人，接连取得新的胜利。
    据缅甸反动报纸透露，活跃在伊洛瓦底、勃固等地区的人民武装，有时集中百人以上的优势兵力，进攻和包围驻守城镇的反动军警，有时派出小分队袭击敌人的警察哨所和运动中的敌人，打得缅甸反动派无法招架。
    七月十五日凌晨，缅共人民武装一百多人，分三路攻入渺?县恭文倪镇，包围了驻守在这个镇的反动军队第九十三步兵营和警察局的大约一百名军警的营地，激战两小时。
    七月二十七日晚，缅共人民武装一百多人分两路打进渺?县毛淡棉遵镇，狠狠地打击了驻守当地的反动军队第九十三步兵营和反动警察，并且烧毁了缅甸反动政府的一座仓库和两家碾米厂。七月二十八日晚，另一批缅共人民武装袭击了正在渺?县巡逻的反动军队。
    在勃固地区，一支克伦族武装袭击了驻扎在沙耶瓦底县甘支洞镇附近的反动军队第三十八步兵营，激战一小时，沉重地打击了敌人。七月二十日下午，缅共人民武装在帕道镇附近伏击了反动军队第三十步兵营的一个班。七月二十二日晚间，活跃在勃固县秉丽光镇一带的缅共人民武装，在这个镇西面十英里的地方，同反动军队第五十七步兵营及当地反动武装激战一小时后，安全地转移到勃固山区，挫败了敌人进行反革命“围剿”的阴谋。七月二十八日晚，一支克伦族武装狠狠地打击了在沙耶瓦底县宋砌镇铁路沿线巡逻的反动军队第三十五步兵营第四连。
    在掸邦的首府东枝，一小队缅共人民武装在七月二十六日傍晚袭击了一个警察哨所。当反动政府出动军警追击时，这支人民武装在消灭敌人之后已安全转移。
    在缅甸东南部的丹那沙林地区，由于缅共人民武装的积极活动，已经使土瓦县的全部陆路交通被切断。缅共人民武装封锁了土瓦县德悦昌镇到矿山之间、土瓦到卑镇的公路交通。七月二十六日，一支缅共人民武装又封锁了土瓦镇通向伊漂镇的公路。此外，在七月二十六日晚间，一支克伦族武装袭击了丹彪西驿镇附近的一个警察局。
    缅共人民武装在猛烈地打击敌人的同时，积极开展群众工作，镇压罪大恶极的反动官吏和恶霸分子。
    七月中旬，在东吁县南部勃固山脉的森林区，缅共人民武装逮捕了反动官吏和恶霸分子九人，没收了他们的财产，处决了其中的两名首恶分子，对其他胁从的分子在进行教育以后予以释放。在缅甸人民武装这一革命行动的鼓舞下，许多林业工人参加了人民武装。
