The image of the working class hero inspires us to move forward
— Celebrating the Colorful Documentary "Piano Accompaniment to 'The Red Lantern'"

The seas are churning with clouds of anger, and the continents are shaking with thunderous excitement. On the great day of celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," which shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, has been brought to the screen and presented to the revolutionary masses. This is another victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally watched and listened to the performance when the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" was first born. Chairman Mao loves it, and so do I. Chairman Mao supports it, and so do I. We, the revolutionary soldiers of Chairman Mao, love this new form of proletarian revolutionary art that praises the heroic figures of the working class and is full of revolutionary spirit. We gather around the radio, listening over and over again. The powerful and majestic piano accompaniment, combined with the passionate Beijing opera singing, touches our hearts with every word and sentence, deeply educating and greatly inspiring us. Everyone excitedly says, "To be a person, be such a person." We should learn from the working-class heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei, learning their unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and their noble qualities of being loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause. "To do things, do such things." We should be like Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei, fighting for the revolution, risking our lives, and following Chairman Mao to make a revolution for life!

The proletarian revolutionary art flower nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing, the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," has, since its birth, been highly praised and warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses for its "unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form" and its "fresh and lively, Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the Chinese people like to see and hear." We, the guards who are loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have long hoped to film the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" into a color movie and to see with our own eyes the moving scenes of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" performance! We have been waiting and waiting, and this day has finally come. The color movie of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has met us, and everyone's wish has been fulfilled. We are so excited that our blood boils and tears of joy flow. We cannot help but raise our arms and shout: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

With the instructions of the unit leaders and comrades, and with an extremely excited heart, I went to watch the color movie of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" first. As the movie began, a bright and cheerful melody immediately attracted me. As the camera moved, the melody was sometimes steady and strong, sometimes high and passionate, and sometimes surging and tumultuous, vividly highlighting the towering image of the excellent fighters of the working class—Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei. The melody kept rolling and jumping, and my heart also beat fiercely. Li Yuhe's revolutionary spirit of "lofty ambition to soar to the sky" strengthened my sense of responsibility to follow the great leader Chairman Mao to make a revolution; Li Tie Mei's ironclad vow of "fighting to the end without retreating from the battlefield" inspired me to hold the gun tightly and defend to the death the socialist red land won by the revolutionary forebears!

I watched the movie with an excited heart and returned to the company with a very joyful heart. When I told everyone the good news, my comrades immediately surrounded me, each one overjoyed and shouting in unison! New soldier Li Jihong excitedly said: I want to be like Li Tie Mei, to take up the revolutionary red flag, to hold high the red lantern, to hold the gun in my hand, and to defend the ironclad land won by the revolutionary martyrs with their lives and blood; I want to forever tread on the bloodstains of the revolutionary martyrs and temper myself into steel in the flames of class struggle.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has been brought to the screen, and the new form of proletarian revolutionary art has been popularized among us workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is a great joy. We shout "bravo" a thousand times and ten thousand times for this joy!

    工人阶级英雄形象鼓舞我们前进
    ——欢呼彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》
    解放军某部　王先福
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年的伟大日子里，闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》搬上了银幕，同广大革命群众见面了。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的又一胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席在钢琴伴唱《红灯记》刚诞生的时候，就亲自观看和聆听了演出。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，我们毛主席的革命战士非常喜爱这个歌颂工人阶级的英雄人物、充满着革命豪情壮志的无产阶级革命文艺新品种。我们围在收音机旁，一遍又一遍地收听，那铿锵有力、气势磅礴的钢琴伴奏，配合着慷慨激昂的京剧唱腔，声声句句都打动了我们的心，使我们受到了深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞。大伙儿激动地说：“做人要做这样的人”，我们要向工人阶级的英雄战士李玉和、李铁梅学习，学习他们无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，无限忠于无产阶级革命事业的高贵品质；“做事要做这样的事”，我们要象李玉和、李铁梅那样，为革命冲锋陷阵，出生入死，跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命！
    由江青同志亲自培育的无产阶级革命文艺鲜花——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，从它诞生的那一天起，就以它“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”，以它“新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”，受到了广大革命群众的高度赞扬和热烈欢迎。我们无限忠于毛主席革命路线的警卫战士多么希望把钢琴伴唱《红灯记》拍摄成一部彩色影片，多么想亲眼看一看钢琴伴唱《红灯记》演出的动人情景！盼啊盼，这一天终于来到了，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的彩色影片同我们见面了，大伙儿的愿望实现了。我们激动得热血沸腾喜泪流，情不自禁地振臂高呼：毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    我带着部队首长和同志们的嘱咐，怀着无比激动的心情，首先去观看了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的彩色影片。影片一开始，一阵明朗欢快的琴声就把我紧紧吸引住了。随着镜头的推移，琴声时而坚实稳健，时而高亢激越，时而汹涌澎湃，鲜明有力地烘托出了工人阶级的优秀战士——李玉和、李铁梅的顶天立地的英雄形象。琴声在不停地翻滚跳动，我的心也在激烈地跳动，李玉和“雄心壮志冲云天”的革命豪情，增强了我紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命的责任感；李铁梅“打不尽豺狼决不下战场”的钢铁誓言，鼓舞着我紧握枪杆子，誓死保卫革命先辈打下的社会主义红色江山！
    我带着激动的心情去看了影片，又怀着十分喜悦的心情回到了连队。当我把这个好消息告诉大家时，同志们一下子把我围了起来，个个欣喜若狂，人人齐声叫好！新战士李继红激动地说：我要象李铁梅那样，接过革命的红旗，高擎红灯，紧握手中枪，保卫好革命先烈用生命和鲜血换来的铁打江山；我要永远踏着革命烈士的血迹前进，在阶级斗争的烈火中把自己锤炼成钢。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》搬上了银幕，无产阶级革命文艺的新品种普及到了我们工农兵中间，这是一件大喜事。我们千遍万遍地为这件喜事大声叫好！
