The greatest concern! The greatest trust! The greatest happiness! The greatest honor!
Great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have approved the invitation for nearly 10,000 outstanding representatives of the working class from across the nation to attend the National Day celebrations in Beijing.

In these joyous days, the worker representatives look back to the past, observe the present, and cannot help but repeatedly shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" They are determined to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, before everything, and more important than everything. They will shoulder the great historical mission of the working class leading everything and complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

New China News Agency, September 29th: The nearly 10,000 outstanding worker representatives from across the nation, approved by great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin to attend the celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, have gathered in the capital Beijing from all directions to prepare to receive the inspection of the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. This is the greatest concern and trust of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for the working class, and it is the greatest happiness and honor for the working class of our country.

In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of our country, together with the broad revolutionary masses, has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, achieved a red tide sweeping the nation, and won one victory after another in the high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have made great contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland. On the eve of the 19th National Day, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, worker representatives from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the nation have come to Chairman Mao's side, bringing the working class and the revolutionary masses' loyalty to Chairman Mao and the abundant fruits of their efforts in grasping revolution and promoting production. Among them, some come from industrial cities with a high concentration of industrial workers such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, Harbin, and Chongqing, while others come from industrial and mining enterprises and forest areas in border regions. They come to Beijing with the heavy responsibility of the working class from various places to receive the inspection of great leader Chairman Mao. This is a great joyous event in the political life of the people of the entire nation.

The working class and the broad revolutionary masses of the capital have welcomed the guests approved by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin with the greatest enthusiasm. In recent days, at Beijing Station and at the representatives' residences, the sound of drums and gongs has been continuous, revolutionary songs have resonated, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" have echoed through the capital's skies. The worker representatives from various places across the nation have gathered in Beijing, and together they will summarize and exchange experiences, which will greatly promote the revolutionary movement in various places.

Under the guidance of the latest instructions of great leader Chairman Mao, on July 27th, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered Tsinghua University, and the main force of the working class began to take the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure. Since then, the vast army of industrial workers from all over the country, in coordination with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, have entered schools and various fields of the superstructure in batches. Under the brilliant illumination of the great thought of Mao Zedong and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wherever the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams go, the revolutionary masses welcome them enthusiastically, and the class enemies are terrified. Many units have quickly launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. These eloquent facts prove: with the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, the working class of our country can indeed lead everything. Many of the worker representatives who have come to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations are members of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams from various places.

As soon as the outstanding representatives of the working class from various places arrive at Chairman Mao's side, they express their profound proletarian feelings to great leader Chairman Mao with the utmost loyalty. After arriving in Beijing, many worker representatives from various regions first went to Tiananmen Square to solemnly swear allegiance to Chairman Mao and declare their resolve. Before setting out for Beijing, the revolutionary masses in various places held grand meetings to warmly see them off, with repeated admonitions and instructions to express their loyalty to great leader Chairman Mao on their behalf, to express their deep affection, and to wish Chairman Mao eternal life! In these joyous days, the worker representatives think of the past, observe the present, and recall the bitterness and sweetness, shedding tears of joy. In the old society, workers were pressed to the bottom of the "three big mountains," living a life worse than cattle and horses. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, the working class has stood up, become the masters of the state, and become the leading class leading everything. This is a tremendous change. The worker representatives think of all this and cannot help but shout repeatedly: Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! In their study and discussions after arriving in Beijing, they said with great emotion: Chairman Mao understands us workers the most, cares for us workers the most, and is always heart to heart with us workers. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! To shoulder the great historical mission of leading everything, we are determined to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, before everything, and more important than everything. With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, grasp revolution, and promote production vigorously. In the struggle, we will continuously improve our political awareness, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new merits and vow to build our great motherland into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席批准邀请全国近万名工人阶级的优秀代表到京参加国庆观礼
    在这幸福的日子里，工人代表想过去，看今天，情不自禁地一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”决心把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，肩负起工人阶级领导一切的伟大历史使命，完成斗批改的伟大任务
    新华社二十九日讯　伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席批准邀请的前来参加中华人民共和国成立十九周年国庆观礼的全国近万名优秀工人代表，已从四面八方会师伟大祖国首都北京，准备接受最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对工人阶级的最大关怀，最大信任，是我国工人阶级的最大幸福，最大光荣。
    在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我国工人阶级同广大革命人民群众一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，实现了全国山河一片红，在“抓革命，促生产”的高潮中，赢得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，为祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设建立了丰功伟绩。在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段，在国庆十九周年光辉节日的前夕，全国二十九个省、市、自治区的工人阶级的代表，带着工人阶级和亿万革命人民对毛主席的赤胆忠心和抓革命、促生产的丰硕成果，来到毛主席的身边。他们之中，有的来自产业工人比较集中的上海、天津、沈阳、西安、广州、成都、武汉、哈尔滨、重庆等工业城市，有的来自边疆地区的工矿企业和林区。他们带着各地工人阶级的重托，来京接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅，这是全国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。
    首都工人阶级和广大革命群众，以最大的热情欢迎毛主席、林副主席批准邀请的客人。连日来，在北京车站，在代表们的住所，锣鼓声不断，革命歌声激荡，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻首都上空。全国各地工人阶级的代表齐集北京，共同总结交流经验，必将大大促进各地的革命运动。
    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，七月二十七日首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入清华大学，工人阶级主力军开始登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台。从这以后，全国各地浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军，配合解放军战士，一批一批地开进了学校，开进了上层建筑各个领域。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，工人毛泽东思想宣传队所到之处，革命群众热烈欢迎，阶级敌人闻风丧胆，许多单位的革命群众迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。这些雄辩的事实证明：有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导，有无产阶级专政的坚强支柱中国人民解放军作后盾，我国工人阶级完全能够领导一切。这次来京参加国庆观礼的工人代表，有不少就是各地工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员。
    各地工人阶级的优秀代表，一来到毛主席身边，就怀着深厚的无产阶级感情向伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心。不少地区的工人代表抵达北京后，第一件事就是到天安门前，庄严地向毛主席宣誓，表决心。他们在出发来京前，各地广大革命群众隆重集会，热烈欢送，千叮咛，万嘱咐，要替他们向伟大领袖毛主席献忠心，表深情，替他们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！在这幸福的日子里，工人代表们想过去，看今天，忆苦思甜热泪流。在旧社会，工人被压在三座“大山”的最底层，过着牛马不如的生活。在毛主席的领导下，工人阶级翻了身，成了国家的主人，成了领导一切的领导阶级，这是天翻地覆的巨大变化。工人代表们想到这一切，情不自禁地一遍又一遍欢呼：毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！他们在来京以后的学习、座谈中，无比激动地说：毛主席最了解我们工人，最关心我们工人，永远同我们工人心连心。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！为了担负起领导一切的伟大历史使命，我们决心把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，以毛泽东思想为武器，认真搞好斗、批、改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，在无产阶级文化大革命中再立新功，誓把伟大祖国建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
