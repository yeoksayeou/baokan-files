Chairman Mao teaches us: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung on them, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals."

The Words of an Old Worker

A student came to the mechanical workshop's milling section. At that time, she saw that everywhere was covered in machine oil. The old workers' bodies and hands were all smeared with grease. Therefore, she did not dare to approach, fearing that her clothes would get dirty with oil. An old worker noticed the student's thoughts and was filled with hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. He recited a rhyme to the student: "In the past, there was a college student, who never let go of his books, but was useless at work. He studied electrical engineering, but couldn't install a light bulb. If he got a bit of oil on him, he would quickly wash it off with water..."

Following this, the old worker conducted a profound criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The student listened to the worker's teacher's powerful criticism of the bourgeois educational system and was deeply educated. She reflected on her own fear of getting oil on her, thinking that she too had been poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line. Fear of getting grease on her clothes was actually her mind being stained with bourgeois filth. The old worker cared deeply for the Red Guards and often gave her class education; encouraging her to read Chairman Mao's books well, not to forget her roots, and not to forget class struggle, to be a good student of Chairman Mao. From the old worker's every word and deed, the student saw the worker class's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and their noble quality of hating the Chinese Khrushchev. From then on, she corrected her wrong thoughts, actively participated in labor, was not afraid of getting dirty or tired, and humbly learned from the worker class, determined to thoroughly reform her bourgeois worldview under the leadership and help of the worker class. Later, the old worker teacher said humorously, "Be careful not to get oil on you." The student said:

"Clothes can be washed if they get dirty, but if your thoughts get dirty, they will change. I want to be an honest student of the worker teacher."

The old worker, hearing this, happily praised her, saying: "You are truly a good student raised by Chairman Mao. We workers need successors like you."

Under the old worker's education, the student's thoughts and feelings changed. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought began to take root in her mind. When the proletarian headquarters issued the great call for educated youth to go to the countryside, she eagerly signed up, heading to the borders of the motherland, and embarked on the road of revolutionizing by combining with the workers and peasants.

    毛主席教导我们：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”
    老工人的一席话
    有个学生来到机械车间铣工组，当时她一看，到处都是机器油，老工人的身上，手上，都沾满了油垢，因此，就不敢靠近，生怕身上沾了油，弄脏了衣服。一位老工人看透了这个同学的心思，便激起了对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线的无比的憎恨。他给这个学生说了段顺口溜：“过去有个大学生，手里不离书，干活不中用，学了电工学，不会安电灯，身上弄点油，赶快用水冲……。”接着，老工人对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线进行了深刻的批判。这位同学听了工人师傅对资产阶级教育制度的深刻有力的批判，深受教育，联想到自己怕沾油的思想，心想，自己不也是中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的流毒吗？怕身上沾上了油垢，实际上是自己思想上已沾上了资产阶级的油垢。老工人十分关心红卫兵小将，经常对她进行阶级教育；鼓励她好好读毛主席的书，不忘本，不能忘记阶级斗争，要做毛主席的好学生。从老工人的一言一行上，这位同学看到了工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，对中国赫鲁晓夫非常痛恨的高贵品质。从此，她纠正了错误思想，积极参加劳动，不怕脏，不怕累，更加虚心地向工人阶级学习，决心在工人阶级的领导和帮助下彻底改造资产阶级世界观。后来老工人师傅很风趣地说：“小心身上别弄上了油。”这位同学说：
  “衣服脏了可以洗，要是思想脏了就会变质，我要老老实实地当工人师傅的小学生。”老工人听了，高兴地夸奖她说：“你真是毛主席培养出来的好学生，咱们工人阶级就是要的这样的接班人。”
    这位同学在老工人的教育下，思想感情起了变化，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在头脑里开始扎下了根。当无产阶级司令部发出了知识青年上山下乡的伟大号召，她积极报名，奔向祖国的边疆，走上了与工农相结合的革命化大道。
