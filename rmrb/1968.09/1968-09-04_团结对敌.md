One Sunday morning, in the dormitory of Nanjing Radio and Television University, the Red Guards Du Runying, Wang Jinxiu, and Ling Yuping stood in front of a portrait of Chairman Mao, holding up the red revolutionary book, swearing allegiance to Chairman Mao. How did these three Red Guards, who had not spoken to each other, become good comrades? Let's start from the beginning.

Du Runying and Wang Jinxiu are daughters of poor peasants, while Ling Yuping is the daughter of a worker. They are in the same class and dormitory, and are close class sisters. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the instigation of a handful of class enemies, the three of them would turn their heads away when they saw each other, and none of them would talk to the others. After learning about their situation, the old worker Hu Yunzhao of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team thought, "If you don't understand what class is, and you don't understand what exploitation is, you don't understand revolution." These three students, although they grew up in sweet times, are like three bitter melons on the same vine. As long as they are helped to recognize the exploitation and oppression their parents suffered in the old society, their class hatred will be aroused, and they will be able to transform from enemies into comrades. Therefore, Old Hu started a Mao Zedong Thought study class in their class and recalled bitterness and sweetness with them.

At the bitterness meeting, Old Worker Hu Yunzhao, with deep hatred for the class enemies, angrily denounced, "In the old society, my family of eight people had five people tortured to death. My father was a dock worker. One day, he was crushed by a heavy sack on the plank. The heartless capitalists and foremen also whipped him. After returning home, he died in less than two days. After my father died, my family had to beg for food. My grandparents starved to death on the road, and my younger sister was taken by the landlord and hanged herself..." The bitter family history of the worker aroused the hatred of the Red Guards against the class enemies. The worker's daughter Ling Yuping, with tears in her eyes, recalled the tragic scene of her mother's exploitation and oppression as a child worker in the old society and said, "With Chairman Mao leading us, I have today! A handful of class enemies incite the masses to fight against the masses, and we must not be fooled again." Du Runying and Wang Jinxiu also said, "Our parents all suffered the same hardships in the old society. After liberation, our lives have been like sesame seeds blooming higher and higher. We have a common benefactor, and the benefactor is the great leader Chairman Mao; we have a common enemy, and the enemy is a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders. In the past, we only fought 'internal wars' and did not see the capitalist roaders behind us. We must follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the working class, and put the account on a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders. We must unite and fight the enemy together."

Based on recalling bitterness and sweetness, Comrade Hu Yunzhao led them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest." Chairman Mao's words were like a red sun shining in their hearts. Everyone said: Our parents are all bitter gourds on the same vine, and we are all sunflowers under the red sun. The revolutionary tradition is passed down from generation to generation, and the sunflowers will forever face the red sun. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, be the vanguard of class struggle, and be the promoters of the great alliance!

    团结对敌
    一个星期天上午，在南京无线电工业学校的宿舍里，红卫兵小将都润英、王金秀和凌宇平，站在伟大领袖毛主席像前，高举红彤彤的革命宝书，向毛主席宣誓。这三个互相不说话的红卫兵小将是怎样变成了好战友的呢？话得从头谈起。
    都润英、王金秀是贫下中农的女儿，凌宇平是工人的女儿。她们在一个班级，宿舍斜对门，是要好的阶级姊妹。在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于一小撮阶级敌人挑拨离间，使她们三人见面扭头过，谁也不理谁。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的老工人胡云召了解到她们的情况后就想，林副主席教导我们：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”这三个同学虽然是在甜水里长大的，但都是一根苦藤上的三个瓜。只要帮助她们认识自己父辈在旧社会所受的剥削和压迫，激发她们的阶级仇恨，就能够使她们由冤家对头变成一家人。于是，老胡就在她们班里办起毛泽东思想学习班，和她们一起忆苦思甜。
    在忆苦会上，老工人胡云召怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，愤怒地控诉说：“在旧社会里，我家八口人，活活被折磨死了五口人。我父亲是码头工人，有一天被沉重的麻包压倒在跳板上。狼心狗肺的资本家和把头，还用皮鞭抽打他。父亲回家后，不到两天就死了。父亲死后，我家只好要饭糊口。祖父母饿死在路上，妹妹被地主抢去，上吊死了……”老工人的苦难家史，激发了红卫兵小将对阶级敌人的仇恨。工人的女儿凌宇平含着眼泪，回忆了母亲在旧社会当童工时所受剥削和压迫的悲惨情景后说：有毛主席领导，我才有今天啊！一小撮阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众，我们决不能再上当了。都润英和王金秀也接着说：我们的父母在旧社会都受过同样的苦。解放后，我们的生活都象芝麻开花节节高。我们有共同的恩人，恩人就是伟大领袖毛主席；我们有共同的敌人，敌人就是一小撮死不悔改的走资派。过去，我们只打“内战”，没有看到后面有走资派。我们一定要听毛主席的话，向工人阶级学习，把账记在一小撮死不悔改的走资派身上，团结起来，共同对敌。
    在忆苦思甜的基础上，胡云召同志又引导她们反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。”毛主席的话，象一轮红日照亮了她们的心。大家说：我们的父母都是一根藤上的苦瓜，我们都是红太阳下的葵花。革命传统代代传，葵花永向红太阳。我们永远紧跟毛主席干革命，做阶级斗争的闯将，当革命大联合的促进派！
