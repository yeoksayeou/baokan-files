The fascist atrocities committed by the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet regime against political prisoners in Malaya have aroused the intense anger of the broad masses of the Malayan people, who have taken various actions to resolutely support the heroic hunger strike of political prisoners illegally detained in the Mersing and Batu Gajah concentration camps, and to strongly condemn and protest against the heinous crimes of the Rahman puppet regime.

According to reports from Singapore newspapers, about six hundred people in the city of Penang in northern Malaya held demonstrations in four different areas on the 3rd, resolutely supporting the heroic hunger strike of political prisoners in the Mersing and Batu Gajah concentration camps. The emotionally charged demonstrators held up banners reading "Oppose Unreasonable Persecution" and shouted slogans, angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities committed by the Rahman puppet regime against political prisoners.

The Rahman puppet regime dispatched a large number of savage "riot control teams" to brutally suppress the demonstrators, and crazily opened fire and launched tear gas.

The newspapers also reported that the Malayan Labor Party's Batu Pahat branch committee held a protest rally on August 31. The meeting resolved to fully support the hunger strike of political prisoners in the Mersing and Batu Gajah concentration camps, to protest against the unreasonable arrest of the chairman and secretary of the branch, and to demand that the reactionary authorities immediately release all political prisoners.

The people of Johor Bahru in southern Malaya held a torchlight demonstration on the evening of August 29 to resolutely support the just struggle of the political prisoners.

The political prisoners illegally detained in the Mersing and Batu Gajah concentration camps have been on a hunger strike for the 20th and 14th days respectively as of the 4th, to protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Rahman puppet regime against the Malayan people.
