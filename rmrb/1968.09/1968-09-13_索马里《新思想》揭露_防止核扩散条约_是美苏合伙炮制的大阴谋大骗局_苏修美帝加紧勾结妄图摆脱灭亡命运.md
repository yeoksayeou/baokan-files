	New Ideas, a magazine published in Somalia, recently released its third issue, which features an article exposing and condemning the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" that was pushed through the United Nations by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in June of this year.

	The article sharply points out that this is a "major conspiracy and fraud" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	The article, titled "Moscow and Washington Further Ally and Collude," points out that this so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" was passed under the pressure of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. "The purpose of this treaty is to control the world, to maintain the nuclear blackmail of the major powers over countries that do not yet have nuclear weapons. In reality, this is an unjust, unequal treaty serving the interests of the major powers, and nothing else."

	The article further points out: "The revolutionary tide of the people of various countries is surging higher and higher, developing and growing stronger day by day, while the situation of imperialism and Soviet revisionism is becoming more and more difficult.

	"Therefore, they are attempting to escape their fate of failure and destruction through mutual collusion and further alliance."

	The article states, "The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is against the people of all countries in the world, and it is also against the people of China.

	"This treaty is imposed on non-nuclear countries, preventing them from developing nuclear weapons for self-defense. This treaty does not prohibit U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism from producing nuclear weapons, stockpiling nuclear weapons, and expanding nuclear bases, and at the same time, they do not assume any responsibility to guarantee that they will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries. This treaty even restricts non-nuclear countries from using atomic energy for peaceful purposes."

	The article emphasizes that the people of all countries in the world do not recognize this treaty. Because recognizing it would mean acknowledging the permanent monopoly of nuclear weapons by the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists, keeping the people of all countries in a state of submission and humiliation forever.

    索马里《新思想》揭露“防止核扩散条约”是美苏合伙炮制的大阴谋大骗局
    苏修美帝加紧勾结妄图摆脱灭亡命运
    新华社十二日讯　摩加迪沙消息：最近出版的索马里《新思想》杂志第三期发表一篇文章，揭露和谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义今年六月操纵联合国通过所谓“防止核扩散条约”。
    文章一针见血地指出，这是美苏合伙炮制的一个“大阴谋和大骗局”。
    这篇题为《莫斯科和华盛顿进一步结盟和勾结》的文章指出，这项所谓“防止核扩散条约”，是在美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的压力下通过的。“这个条约的目的是控制世界，坚持大国对现在还没有核武器的国家的核讹诈。实际上这是一个非正义的、不平等的、为大国利益服务的条约，而不是别的。”
    文章还指出：“各国人民革命的浪潮越来越高涨，越发展越强大，而帝国主义和苏联修正主义的处境则一天天地更加困难了。
    “因此，他们就妄图通过相互勾结和进一步结盟来使自己摆脱失败和灭亡的命运。”
    文章说，“防止核扩散条约”是反对世界各国人民的，也是反对中国人民的。
    “这个条约是强加于无核国家的，不让它们发展用于自卫的核武器。这个条约不禁止美帝国主义和苏联修正主义生产核武器、储存核武器、扩大核基地，同时他们也不承担任何责任保证对没有核武器国家不使用核武器。这个条约甚至还限制无核国家把原子能用于和平的目的。”
    文章强调指出，世界各国人民是不承认这一条约的。因为承认它就意味着承认苏修和美帝对核武器的永远垄断，使各国人民永远生活在顺从和屈辱之中。
