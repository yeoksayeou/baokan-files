Shanghai's Huaihai Road, a famous commercial center, has long been known for its large stores opening at nine in the morning. However, after the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team took over the Women's Labor Products Store, they armed the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They broke through this unreasonable "century-old rule" and changed the opening time to eight in the morning, creating a new trend that is warmly welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers—

New Trends in Stores

As the clock struck eight, the doors of the Women's Labor Products Store on Huaihai Road in Shanghai swung open. Early-morning farmers and workers finishing their night shifts flocked into the store to purchase their needed items. The smiling saleswomen enthusiastically greeted the first batch of customers of the day.

As people left the counter with their packages, they all said with satisfaction, "This business hour is truly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers!"

Huaihai Road is one of Shanghai's famous commercial centers. For over a hundred years, the large stores on this street have always opened at nine in the morning. Recently, the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team took over the Women's Labor Products Store. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and finally broke through this unreasonable "century-old rule," making Huaihai Road's first large department store open at eight in the morning!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The working class must lead everything." As soon as the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team took over the Women's Labor Products Store, they posed this question to the store's employees: "We are the Women's Labor Products Store; how can we better serve the laboring people?" At that time, some saleswomen replied, "Our store opens too late. Some workers and poor and lower-middle peasants come early to buy things and often have to wait outside for us to open." Some offered specific suggestions, saying, "According to the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we should start business an hour earlier."

However, some employees were still stuck in old ways of thinking. They doubted, saying, "The large stores on Huaihai Road have always opened at nine; is it okay for us to open earlier?" Some female employees also worried that starting business earlier would cause difficulties in arranging their household chores and thus did not agree with this.

The Worker Propaganda Team analyzed these situations and felt that reasonably arranging business hours was not just a business issue but first and foremost a question of for whom to serve. They then studied with everyone Chairman Mao's great teaching, "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle," and engaged in a comparison of new and old societies, a criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, and conducted thorough political and ideological work among the store employees.

The old worker from the propaganda team said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly. We open an hour earlier, allowing night-shift workers to buy things and go back to sleep earlier; farmers can buy things and go back to work earlier. We work an extra hour and can increase an hour of labor or rest time for how many workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Our household chores are small, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is big. Small reasons must yield to big reasons, personal interests must yield to collective interests."

The firm words of the Worker Propaganda Team members deeply touched the hearts of the store employees. Some saleswomen said, "In the past, the parasites living on Huaihai Road would indulge in nightlife and sleep late in the morning. Our business hours were adapted to their needs." Some saleswomen said, "I originally thought that opening a bit earlier or later didn't matter much, but now I understand that opening an hour earlier is a big issue of for whom to serve, a reflection of two different business philosophies."

A lively study and discussion raised the political awareness of the store employees and established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Everyone unanimously decided to start business an hour earlier. On the morning of September 23, the employees, facing the golden sun, drummed and beat gongs in front of the store, posting a big red joyous announcement that broke through the "century-old rule" of Huaihai Road.

The revolutionary initiative of the Women's Labor Products Store employees shook the entire Huaihai Road. Now, many stores on this street are considering rearranging their business hours based on the principle of better serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many worker, peasant, and soldier customers see this phenomenon and enthusiastically praise, "The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is great; wherever they go, they solve the big problems there!"

专栏：庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年

    上海淮海路的大商店，过去都是上午九点以后才开门营业。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻劳动妇女用品商店后，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，终于冲破了这个不合理的“百年陈规”，改为早上八点开门营业，开创了为工农群众所热烈欢迎的——
    商店新风
    时钟刚刚敲响八点，上海淮海路大街劳动妇女用品商店的门便敞开了。一早进城的农民和做完夜班回家的工人，纷纷走进店堂，购买他们所需要的用品。满面笑容的营业员们，热情地接待当天的第一批顾客。
    当人们挟着一包包商品离开柜台的时候，都满意地说：“这样的营业时间，才是为工农兵服务！”
    淮海路这条街，是上海著名的商业中心之一。一百多年来，这条街上的大商店，从来都是上午九点以后才开门营业。最近，工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻劳动妇女用品商店，他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，终于冲破了这个不合理的“百年陈规”，使淮海路上第一次出现了大百货商店早上八点开门的新事！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“工人阶级必须领导一切”。工人毛泽东思想宣传队一进驻劳动妇女用品商店，就向商店里的职工们提出了这样一个问题：“我们是劳动妇女用品商店，应该如何更好地为劳动人民服务？”当时有的营业员就回答说：“我们商店现在开门太迟，有些工人、贫下中农一早来买东西，往往要站在外面等我们开门。”有的提出具体建议说：“根据工农兵的需要，我们最好能够提早一个小时开始营业。”
    但是，也有的职工思想上脱不出老框框，他们怀疑地说：“淮海路上的大商店从来都是九点开门，我们提早开门好吗？”也还有些女职工担心提早营业时间，会给自己安排家务带来困难，因此不同意这样做。
    工人宣传队分析了这些情况，感到合理安排营业时间，不单是一个业务问题，而首先是一个为谁服务的问题。于是，他们就和大家一起学习毛主席“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题”的伟大教导，一起进行新旧社会的回忆对比，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货，向商店职工们进行深入细致的政治思想工作。
    宣传队的老工人说：“毛主席教导我们要全心全意地为人民服务。我们提早一小时开门，让做夜班的工人下班后买到东西可以早点回去睡觉；农民买到东西可以早点回去出工。我们多工作一个钟头，就能够为多少个工人、贫下中农增加一个钟头的劳动或休息时间。我们的家务事小，为工农兵服务的事大，小道理要服从大道理，个人利益要服从整体利益。”
    工人宣传队队员们这些铿锵的语言，深深地打动了商店职工的心弦。有的营业员说：“过去住在淮海路上的那些寄生虫，夜里花天酒地，早上睡懒觉，我们商店的服务时间就是适应这些人的需要。”有的营业员说：“本来我觉得早一点或是迟一点开门没有什么要紧，现在懂得了提早一小时营业，是一个为谁服务的大问题，是两种经营思想的反映。”
    一场生动的学习和讨论，使商店职工们提高了政治觉悟，树立起了全心全意为工农兵服务的思想。大家一致决定：提早营业时间一个小时。九月二十三日早晨，职工们迎着金色的朝阳，敲锣打鼓在商店门前贴出了冲破淮海路上“百年陈规”的大红喜报。
    劳动妇女用品商店职工的这一革命创举，震动了整个的淮海路。现在，这条路上的许多商店，正根据更好地为工农兵服务的原则，纷纷酝酿重新安排营业时间的问题。许多工农兵顾客看到这种现象，热烈地称赞说：“工人毛泽东思想宣传队就是好，走到那里解决了那里的大问题！”
