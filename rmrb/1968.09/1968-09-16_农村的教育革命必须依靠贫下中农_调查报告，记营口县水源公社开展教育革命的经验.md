The editors of the Red Flag magazine note: The experience of Water Source Commune in Yingkou County in carrying out the education revolution is excellent and deserves attention.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." The comrades of Water Source Commune in Yingkou County have begun to implement Chairman Mao's great directive in practice, implementing the management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, in conjunction with the revolutionary teachers and students. Some people view the education revolution as very difficult. In fact, as long as one adheres to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely and not vacillatingly, seriously and not perfunctorily, and is good at summarizing experiences and lessons, one does not need much time to see the results. Water Source Commune has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian education revolution thought for just over half a year, and has it not already taken on a new look?

The education revolution in the schools of Water Source Commune in Liaoning Province's Yingkou County has been quite successful. Their most important experience is that the revolutionary teachers and students in the schools combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, relying closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a mass movement for the education revolution, implementing the management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, in conjunction with the revolutionary teachers and students.

Breaking Out of the School's Small Circle

At the beginning, the leaders and teachers of various schools had a tendency to look down on workers and peasants, and did not fully recognize the role of the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force in the rural education revolution. Some said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants have no culture; what can they do?" Others said, "I come from a poor and lower-middle peasant family and am always with the poor and lower-middle peasants; I have already combined with the poor and lower-middle peasants." Thus, the schools closed their doors to carry out the movement, resulting in an incomplete great criticism and a reform of education that was limited to drafting plans, studying course settings, selecting textbooks, and correcting classroom teaching methods. They went around in circles and could not break out of the old framework. Since the resumption of classes and revolution in March of last year, a year has passed, but there has been little progress and nothing significant has been achieved.

The commune revolutionary committee and the propaganda team of a certain unit of the PLA, in response to the above situation, held a study class for revolutionary teachers and students in March of this year to study Chairman Mao's directives on the education revolution and the experience of the education revolution in Jin County's Denshahe Commune. On this basis, they summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous period. These experiences and lessons are: first, closing the doors to reform education, alienating the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants; second, limiting the reform to teaching content and methods, without fundamentally changing the system; third, not understanding that to carry out the education revolution well, one must first carry out the revolutionization of thought. They realized that to solve these problems, they must walk out of the school, go to the masses, combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and launch a mass movement for the education revolution.

Together with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Smashing the Revisionist Education Line

After the revolutionary teachers and students of Water Source Commune walked out of the school gates, under the leadership of the commune revolutionary committee and the help of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, they launched a mass movement together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's education revolution thought, and to criticize and smash the revisionist education line of China's Khrushchev.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with their own personal experiences, criticized the old education system on several fundamental issues such as for whom the school is open, who is being cultivated, and who is running the school. They pointed out: The revisionist education line set up many barriers for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school: the entrance examination barrier, the retention barrier, the expulsion barrier, the promotion barrier. In addition, the school layout was unreasonable, making it difficult for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to study nearby. An impoverished peasant from the Eighth Brigade said, "In our brigade, there are twenty-nine households, with three high school graduates. We poor and lower-middle peasants have twenty-eight households sharing one, while a rich peasant and capitalist family has two. For whom is this school open?" Many children of poor and lower-middle peasants, after school, not only could not help their parents with their homework, but also had to help with farm work, so their grades were poor. In a class at Quli Primary School, there were thirty-eight students at the beginning, and thirty-three were retained or expelled over six years, all of whom were children of poor and lower-middle peasants, leaving only five at graduation.

The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out: In the past, schools emphasized "intellectual education first" and "grades first," which was "recognizing grades but not people, recognizing people but not class," causing many students to "study hard for grades" and "fight for grades in the field," with "grades, grades, grades" in their minds, forgetting about the revolution.

The poor and lower-middle peasants sharply criticized: In the past, schools cultivated many students who wanted to go to the city and not stay in the countryside. They described some high school students as "one year in the countryside, two years in the city, three years not recognizing their parents." The textbooks did not emphasize Mao Zedong Thought but were filled with a lot of feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist black goods, such as "Sima Guang breaks the pot," "Kong Rong gives up the pear," and China's Khrushchev's "brave in Anshan." The textbooks also had things like "in front of and behind the house, planting melons and beans." The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "This is the black goods of China's Khrushchev's 'three autonomies and one contract,' which we have long criticized and condemned. Why read such books!" Because the school taught this, many students also had "self" in their minds and looked down on workers and peasants. A graduate of the Eighth Brigade's junior high school, after returning to the countryside for production, was selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants to be an accountant, but he said, "I studied for eight or nine years and still have to do this!" The poor and lower-middle peasants compared the PLA with the school, saying: The PLA is a true school of Mao Zedong Thought, cultivating a large number of heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Li Wentong, and Men He in a short time, while the school, from primary school to university, took sixteen or seventeen years, but cultivated a large number of intellectuals who looked down on workers and peasants, were detached from reality, and did not emphasize proletarian politics.

The facts prove: The poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, understand the harm of the revisionist education line the deepest, and have the most say in criticizing the old education system. The teachers and students of various schools in Water Source Commune said in their reflections: "The direction is pointed out by Chairman Mao, and the eyes are brightened by the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Relying on the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Create a New Educational System

In the education revolution, the fundamental question is who is in power. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Should the poor and lower-middle peasants take control of educational power? On this issue, there were different understandings in Water Source Commune. Some members of the revolutionary committee said, "The highest cultural level in our revolutionary committee is an incomplete junior high school education. If we take control of educational power, won't we make a joke of it!" After studying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and related documents, the members of the revolutionary committee realized the importance of taking control of educational power and understood that if workers and peasants do not take control of educational power, the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools will not end. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their willingness to take control of educational power.

After repeated discussions and consultations with the poor and lower-middle peasants, the commune revolutionary committee decided to abolish the old principal responsibility system and establish education revolution committees in various schools, with members including representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students. The education revolution committees of various schools all work under the leadership of the brigade revolutionary committees, implementing unified leadership. The deputy director of the brigade revolutionary committee also serves as the deputy director of the school education revolution committee, and the director of the school education revolution committee also participates in the brigade revolutionary committee.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Water Source Commune, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "the school system should be shortened," changed the existing six-year primary school system to a five-year system and the six-year three-three segmented junior high school system to a four-year two-two segmented system. They carried forward the spirit of thrift in running schools and, under the conditions of not increasing personnel, not adding equipment, and not increasing the burden on the masses, established twenty schools of five-year, seven-year, and nine-year integrated systems throughout the commune, basically achieving the goal of having a school in every brigade, students not leaving the brigade to study junior high school, and not leaving the commune to study senior high school. Students all commute, thus not only saving school buildings but also making it affordable for the poor and lower-middle peasants. A child entering school at the age of six or seven and graduating from high school after nine years is only fifteen or sixteen years old, just in time to participate in agricultural labor. After working for a few years and gaining practical experience, some can also be selected to go to university. This school system is more in line with the actual situation of the countryside, conducive to popularizing education, and is welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

New Changes, New Situation

At present, the revolutionary teachers and students of various schools in Water Source Commune have made it a common practice to study, apply, and promote Mao Zedong Thought. The new school system has been popularized in Water Source Commune, and the enrollment rate has reached 100%, with past dropouts and students who have stopped attending school also returning to school. The entire commune has added twenty-six classes and more than 1,100 students.

The poor and lower-middle peasants have truly taken control of educational power, changing their past views of the school. In the past, the relationship between the school and the production brigade was "I teach my books, you farm your fields." When the poor and lower-middle peasants talked about the school, they often said, "Your school is like this and that." Now they say, "Our school" when they open their mouths. The relationship between the school and the brigade, and between the teachers and the peasants, has fundamentally changed. The school teachers and students adopt the method of "going out and inviting in," on the one hand, participating in the three great revolutionary movements of the brigade, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and conducting social investigations; on the other hand, inviting poor and lower-middle peasants who have deep hatred to the school to talk about their family history and village history, and to recall bitterness and sweetness together. They also invite the brigade security director to teach class struggle courses, the militia company commander to teach military courses, and old peasants and agricultural technicians to teach production technology courses. Many community members also understand that educating children is not only the school's responsibility but also the family's responsibility, and they must teach their children to prevent revisionism. In this way, school education, social education, and family education are combined.

Due to the significant progress in the revolutionization of teachers' thoughts, the relationship between teachers and students has also greatly improved. Many teachers realized that the poor relationship between teachers and students in the past was mainly due to their own failure to correctly treat the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the young comrades, which was not a matter of method but a fundamental attitude problem. Therefore, they actively made self-criticisms in front of the students, fought against their own selfishness, and became one with the students, studying, criticizing, laboring, exercising, and entertaining together. In this way, some mischievous students also reflected on their shortcomings and mistakes. A new relationship has been established between teachers and students. Teachers teach students, students teach teachers, students teach students, and teaching and learning promote each other, raising each other together. The school has presented a lively and vibrant new situation.

    农村的教育革命必须依靠贫下中农
    ——调查报告，记营口县水源公社开展教育革命的经验
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志调查员
    《红旗》杂志编者按：营口县水源公社开展教育革命的经验很好，值得引起人们的重视。
    毛主席指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”营口县水源公社的同志们已经在实践中开始实现毛主席这个伟大的指示，实行由贫下中农为主，结合学校革命师生管理学校，并且改革了学制。有的人把教育革命看得很难。其实，只要按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决地而不是动摇地、认真地而不是草率地做，并善于总结经验教训，不要很长时间就可以看出效果。水源公社坚决实行毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想不过半年多时间，不就面目一新了吗？
    辽宁省营口县水源公社各学校的教育革命，搞得比较出色。他们最重要的一条经验，就是学校的革命师生和贫下中农结合，紧紧依靠贫下中农，开展一场教育革命的群众运动，实行由贫下中农为主，结合学校革命师生管理学校。
    从学校的小圈子走出来
    开始时，各学校的领导和教师由于有轻视工农的思想，对贫下中农在农村教育革命中的主力军作用认识不足。有的说：“贫下中农没文化，他们能搞个啥！”有的说：“我是贫下中农家庭出身，天天和贫下中农在一起，已经同贫下中农结合了。”这样，学校关门搞运动，结果大批判搞不彻底，教改也只限于制定方案、研究课程设置、编选教材、改正课堂教学方法等方面。转来转去，跳不出旧圈子。从去年三月复课闹革命以后，搞了一年时间，进展不大，没有搞出什么名堂来。
    公社革委会和解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队针对上述情况，于今年三月举办了革命师生的毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于教育革命的指示，并学习了金县登沙河公社教育革命的经验，在此基础上，总结了前一段的经验教训。这些经验教训是：一、关门搞教改，脱离了广大贫下中农；二、局限在教学内容和方法上改，没有从根本体制上进行革命；三、不懂得要搞好教育革命，首先要搞好思想的革命化。他们认识到，要解决这些问题，必须走出学校，到群众中去，和贫下中农结合，拜贫下中农为师，大搞教育革命的群众运动。
    和贫下中农一起，大破修正主义教育路线
    水源公社的革命师生走出校门以后，在公社革委会领导和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，和广大贫下中农一起，掀起了一个大学大用毛主席教育革命思想，大批大破中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的群众运动。
    广大贫下中农以自己的亲身经历，在学校为谁开门、培养什么人、依靠谁来办学等几个根本问题上，控诉了旧教育制度的罪恶。他们指出：修正主义教育路线为贫下中农的子女入学设置了重重关卡：入学考试关、留级关、退学关、升学关。此外，还加上学校布点不合理，使贫下中农子女不能就地就近升学。八一大队一个贫农社员说：“我们队二十九户人家，有三个高中毕业生，我们贫下中农二十八户摊一个，而一家富农兼资本家就摊俩，这学校到底为谁开门？”许多贫下中农子弟，由于放学后父母不但不能帮助他温课，还要帮父母干活，所以分数成绩较差。群力小学的一个班，入学时三十八名，六年时间留级、退学的共三十三名，全部是贫下中农子女，毕业时只剩下五名。
    贫下中农指出：过去学校实行的是“智育第一”，“分数第一”，这是“认分不认人，认人不认阶级”，害得许多学生“眼看书本，心怀分数”，在学校里争学分，在队里争工分，满脑子“分，分，分”，把革命抛到脑后去了。
    贫下中农尖锐地批评说：过去学校培养出来许多学生，一心想进城市，不想扎根农村。他们形容有的高中生是“一年土，二年洋，三年不认爹和娘”。学校课本根本不突出毛泽东思想，却塞进了不少封、资、修的黑货，什么“司马光，打破缸”，什么“孔融让梨”，什么中国赫鲁晓夫在安源“一身是胆”。教科书上还有什么“屋前屋后，种瓜种豆”。贫下中农气愤地说：“这是中国赫鲁晓夫‘三自一包’的黑货，我们早就批臭了，这种书念它干什么！”由于学校里教的是这一套，许多学生也是满脑子“私”字，轻视工农。八一大队有个初中毕业生回乡生产后，贫下中农选他当会计，他竟说：“我念八、九年书还干这玩艺儿！”贫下中农拿解放军和学校作了对比，说：解放军是真正的毛泽东思想大学校，短短时间里培养出了大批雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、李文忠、门合式的英雄人物，而学校呢，从小学到大学共花了十六、七年时间，却培养出大批轻视工农、脱离实际、不突出无产阶级政治的知识分子。
    事实证明：贫下中农对毛主席有最深厚的阶级感情，对修正主义教育路线的毒害了解最深刻，对批判旧教育制度最有发言权。水源公社各校师生在谈体会时说：“方向是毛主席给我们指明的，眼睛是贫下中农给我们擦亮的。”
    依靠贫下中农，创建新的教育体制
    在教育革命中，根本问题是谁来掌权的问题。毛主席最近指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”贫下中农要不要掌握教育大权？对这个问题，在水源公社曾经是有不同认识的。有的革委会委员说：“咱革委会里文化程度最高的初中没毕业，叫我们掌文权，还不掌出笑话来呀！”经过学习毛主席的“五·七”指示和有关文件后，革委会成员认识到掌握文权的重要性，懂得工农不去掌握教育大权，资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象就不能结束。因而一致表示要掌握好教育大权。
    公社革委会经过反复讨论和征求贫下中农意见，决定废除旧的校长负责制，各校成立教育革命委员会，成员有贫下中农代表和革命师生代表。各校的教育革命委员会一律在社队革委会领导下工作，实行一元化的领导。大队革委会副主任兼学校教育革命委员会副主任，学校教育革命委员会主任也参加大队革委会。
    水源公社革命师生又根据毛主席“学制要缩短”的教导，将现行的小学六年制改为五年制，中学六年三三分段制改为四年二二分段制。他们发扬了勤俭办学的精神，在不增人员，不添设备，不增加群众负担的条件下，在全社办了五年一贯制、七年一贯制、九年一贯制的学校共二十所，基本上做到了队队有学校，学生念初中不出大队，念高中不出公社。学生一律走读，这样不但节省了校舍，贫下中农也负担得起。一个孩子从六、七岁入学，经过九年到高中毕业，也不过十五、六岁，正好参加农业劳动。劳动几年，有了实践经验以后，有的还可以选送到大学。这种学制，比较切合农村实际情况，利于普及教育，很受贫下中农欢迎。
    新变化，新气象
    目前，水源公社各校革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想已蔚然成风。新学制的教育已经在水源公社普及，学生的入学率达到了百分之百，过去退学、失学的学生也上学了。全公社共增加了二十六个班，一千一百多名学生。
    贫下中农真正掌握了教育大权，就改变了过去对学校的看法。过去学校和生产队的关系是“我教我的书，你种你的田”。贫下中农在提到学校时，常说“你们学校如何如何”，现在他们开口闭口都是“我们的学校”了。学校和社队的关系、教师和农民的关系从根本上改变了。学校师生采取“走出去，请进来”的方法，一方面参加社队的三大革命运动，宣传毛泽东思想，搞社会调查；一方面请苦大仇深的贫下中农来学校讲家史、村史，一同忆苦思甜。他们还请大队治保主任来讲阶级斗争课，民兵连长讲军事课，老农和农业技术员讲生产技术课。许多社员也懂得教育孩子不仅是学校的事，也是家庭的事，要教子防修。这样，学校教育、社会教育、家庭教育三者就结合起来了。
    由于教师的思想革命化大大跨进了一步，师生关系也大大改变了。许多教师认识到，过去师生关系不好，主要责任在自己没有正确对待小将的革命造反精神，这不是方法问题，而是根本态度问题。因此，他们主动在学生面前作检查，斗自己的私，和学生打成一片，同学习，同批判，同劳动，同出操，同娱乐。这样，一些调皮的学生也检查了自己的缺点错误。师生之间建立了新的关系。师教生，生教师，生教生，教学相长，共同提高。学校出现了生动活泼的新局面。
