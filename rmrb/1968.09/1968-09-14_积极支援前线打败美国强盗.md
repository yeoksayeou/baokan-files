Vietnamese Revolutionary Elder Uncle Bi Xian

In the southern part of Vietnam, in the province of Kim Oung, in the village of Jiaotu in Fengle Township, there lives an elderly revolutionary named Uncle Bi Xian. He is actively supporting the anti-American national salvation war. To defeat the American aggressors, he has made significant contributions.

Uncle Bi Xian, at the age of 63, has already sent six of his sons to join the liberation army and work for the National Liberation Front.

Every year, Uncle Bi Xian exceeds the quota for war contributions, supporting the anti-American national salvation war. In recent years, he has also improved his farming methods, increasing his rice yield by more than four times per hectare. This year, he contributed an additional 100 dan of rice (each dan is approximately 20 kilograms) and donated 10,000 dong in cash.

Once, the township mobilized everyone to donate bamboo and wood for making bamboo stakes, building combat villages, and repairing houses for military and revolutionary martyrs' families. Upon hearing this, Uncle Bi Xian generously donated his family's bamboo grove. He also worked with his entire family to make 1,000 bamboo stakes.

Due to Uncle Bi Xian's contributions to the anti-American national salvation war, the Southwestern Zone Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam awarded him the Third-Class Liberation Medal.

The Revolutionary Youth by the Tea River

In a certain township in the liberated area of Quang Ngai Province, situated by the Tea River, the brutal massacres by the enemy have planted seeds of hatred in the hearts of the children here. The children are all actively participating in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

Whenever the enemy drops reactionary leaflets over this township, the youths set up "burn Johnson's mouth" fires in various villages to burn all the reactionary leaflets. When the enemy uses helicopters to broadcast threats and intimidations over the township, the children beat on tin cans to drown out the enemy's voices.

The youths by the Tea River love the liberation army soldiers very much. Each branch of the Young Pioneers has vegetable and melon gardens to support the troops. Each Young Pioneer is responsible for managing one melon plant and a five-meter-long vegetable plot. Whenever the liberation army units come to the township, the Young Pioneers eagerly carry their homegrown vegetables and melons to comfort the liberation army uncles. They also collectively fish and catch crabs to improve the soldiers' meals. The children are particularly enthusiastic and attentive in taking care of wounded and sick soldiers. Once, Ah Lu volunteered to transport wounded soldiers and walked all night to reach the liaison station. Although he was tired and hungry, he still insisted on completing the task of transporting the wounded soldiers.

    积极支援前线打败美国强盗
    南越革命老人比申大伯
    越南南方金瓯省风乐乡焦土村的比申大伯，是一位积极支援抗美救国战争的革命老人。为了打败美国强盗，他积极作出了自己的贡献。
    六十三岁的比申大伯，已经送走六个儿子去参加解放军和做民族解放阵线的工作。
    比申大伯每年都超额缴纳抗战公粮，支援抗美救国战争。近年来，他还开动脑筋，改进耕作方法，使稻谷产量每公顷提高四倍多。今年，他多缴纳了一百斗稻谷（每斗约二十公斤），另外还捐了一万元现金。
    有一次，乡里发动大家捐献竹木材料，供削竹桩、建设战斗村和给军烈属修房子用。比申大伯知道了，就慷慨地把自己家的一片竹林献了出来。他还和全家人一起削了一千枝竹桩。
    由于比申大伯对抗美救国战争作出了贡献，越南南方民族解放阵线南方西区委员会授予他三级解放勋章。
    茶河畔的革命少年
    广义省解放区某乡，座落在茶河畔。敌人的残暴屠杀，在这里的孩子们心里埋下了仇恨的种子，孩子们都积极参加抗美救国斗争。
    每当敌人向这个乡空投反动传单的时候，少年们就在各个村庄开设“烧约翰逊嘴巴的火炉”，把反动传单统统烧掉；当敌人利用直升飞机向这个乡广播，进行威胁恫吓时，孩子们就敲打锡桶，压过敌人的声音。
    茶河畔的孩子们都十分热爱解放军战士。少先队每个分队都有支援部队的瓜园和菜园，每个少先队员负责管理一棵瓜和五米长的菜畦。每当解放军部队来到乡里时，少先队员们就争先恐后地挑上自己种的瓜菜去慰劳解放军叔叔。他们还集体捕鱼、捉蟹为解放军改善伙食。孩子们对解放军伤病员的照料更是十分热情和周到。有一次，阿陆志愿参加了运伤员的工作，他整整走了一夜才到联络站。虽然又累又饿，但他仍然坚持完成了运送伤员的任务。　（新华社）
