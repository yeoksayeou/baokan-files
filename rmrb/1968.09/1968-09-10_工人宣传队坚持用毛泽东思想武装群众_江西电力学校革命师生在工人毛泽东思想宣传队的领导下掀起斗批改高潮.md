Under the inspiration and guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered Jiangxi Electric Power School has persisted in arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. They have led the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and have initiated a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation across the entire school.

Jiangxi Electric Power School has over six hundred teachers, students, and staff. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, achieving great merits. However, due to the manipulation of a handful of class enemies behind the scenes, inciting the masses to fight each other, and the rampant bourgeois factionalism among some people, the school was split into two major factions, forming many opposing small cliques, and engaging in prolonged "internal warfare." This seriously affected the progress of revolutionary great unity, the three-in-one combination, and the cleansing of class ranks, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation across the entire school was not done well.

In response to this situation, the Jiangxi Jiujiang District Revolutionary Committee and the Jiujiang City Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work," recently jointly dispatched a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, mainly composed of workers and with the participation of PLA soldiers, to enter this school.

After entering the school, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team first repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on the mass line and investigation and research. While vigorously promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, they also conducted in-depth and detailed investigation and research work. The team members went to various classes and the broad teaching staff, through extensive heart-to-heart talks, to understand the class struggle situation in the school and various active thoughts among the masses. This not only quickly broke the long-standing cold atmosphere of educational revolution in the school but also rapidly grasped the historical situation of class struggle and the two-line struggle in the school, grasped the new trends of current class struggle, grasped the various active thoughts of the masses, found the main obstacles hindering the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and created conditions for the comprehensive development of work.

In the process of understanding and mastering the situation, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team persistently and unremittingly used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize and arm the masses, quickly uniting the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to form a vast army of educational revolution, actively participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation across the entire school. In the course of work, the propaganda team vigorously encouraged the proletarian spirit of the active elements in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end; while actively using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to educate and arm these active elements, encouraging them to stand tall, boldly participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, actively engage in the torrent of class struggle, and bravely fight, making these active elements play a significant role in initiating the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The propaganda team also, starting from cherishing the revolutionary youngsters, did painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work on the leaders of some mass organizations with relatively serious errors and greater ideological resistance, actively guiding them to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to examine and check themselves, bravely conduct self-criticism, encouraging them to achieve new merits in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. As a result of the propaganda team's work, the majority of the school's masses were quickly united, isolating and severely striking a handful of class enemies.

In the course of work, the propaganda team deeply felt that to do well in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to sweep away various non-proletarian thoughts.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the propaganda team organized the entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the study classes, the propaganda team helped everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's various latest instructions, fiercely criticize the bourgeois reactionary "multi-center means no center" theory, fiercely criticize factionalism and sectarianism, and at the same time, fiercely criticized the bourgeois bad academic style of learning and using Chairman Mao's latest instructions inconsistently and being insincere.

Through study and criticism, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff deeply realized that regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learning without using them, or being inconsistent in words and deeds, or selectively interpreting them to serve the interests of one's own small clique or small group is disloyal to Chairman Mao, which is a fundamental issue of stance. They all wrote big-character posters and resolutions, expressing their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, learn and use consistently, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and resolutely carry out the educational revolution.

At the same time, the propaganda team members also, through their own bitter experiences of being exploited and oppressed in the old society and their personal experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, conducted a class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness to the broad teachers, students, and staff, helping them to raise their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle.

In leading the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, with Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, fully demonstrated the noble qualities of the working class and the PLA of having a firm stance, clear banners, daring to struggle, and being responsible, setting a good example for revolutionary teachers and students, thereby further mobilizing and arming the broad revolutionary masses, playing a significant role in carrying out revolutionary criticism, cleansing class ranks, and promoting struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Not long after the propaganda team entered the school, a handful of class enemies inside the school spread malicious rumors and ignited evil fires everywhere, attempting to sow discord between revolutionary teachers and students and the propaganda team, disrupting the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The propaganda team, upon learning of this situation, immediately responded by fiercely exposing and criticizing in large and small meetings, further enhancing the revolutionary teachers and students' confidence in fighting the enemy.

Under the strong leadership and promotion of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Jiangxi Electric Power School have now launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They are determined to follow the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their thinking, unify their steps, and unify their actions, seriously implement Chairman Mao's various latest instructions, better unite to fight the enemy. Many revolutionary teachers, students, and staff said, "The workers' propaganda team brought us Mao Zedong Thought, brought us the noble qualities of the proletariat, brought us the sharp weapons of fighting the enemy. The workers' propaganda team is good! We must respectfully learn from the working class, thoroughly transform our worldview, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!"

    工人宣传队坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众
    江西电力学校革命师生在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下掀起斗批改高潮
    新华社南昌九日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的鼓舞和指引下，开进江西省电力学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众，带领广大革命师生员工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，在全校掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    江西电力学校共有六百多名师生员工。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个学校的革命师生起来造了党内一小撮走资派的反，建立了很大的功绩。但是，由于一小撮阶级敌人在幕后挑动群众斗群众，加上部分人资产阶级派性泛滥，使学校分裂为两大派，出现了许多互相对立的小山头，长期“内战”不休，严重地影响了学校的革命大联合、革命三结合和清理阶级队伍等项工作的开展，全校斗、批、改搞得不好。
    针对这种情况，江西九江专区革委会和九江市革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，在不久前联合派出了一支以工人为主体、有解放军指战员参加的毛泽东思想宣传队，开进了这所学校。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，首先反复学习了毛主席历来关于群众路线和调查研究的伟大教导。他们一面大张旗鼓地热情宣传和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，一面展开深入细致的调查研究工作。宣传队的成员分头深入到各班级和广大教职员工中，通过广泛的谈心活动，了解学校阶级斗争情况和群众中的各种活思想。这样做的结果，不仅很快打破了学校教育革命长期清清冷冷的局面，而且迅速地掌握了学校阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史情况，掌握了当前阶级斗争的新动向，掌握了群众的各种活思想，找到了妨害斗、批、改的主要障碍，为全面开展工作创造了条件。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在了解和掌握情况的过程中，坚持不懈地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想发动群众，武装群众，使广大革命师生员工迅速团结起来，组成浩浩荡荡的教育革命大军，积极投入到全校的斗、批、改中。宣传队在工作过程中，大鼓学校中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子的无产阶级志气；一面积极用毛主席最新指示教育和武装这些积极分子，鼓励他们挺直腰干，大胆地参加斗、批、改，积极投身到阶级斗争的洪流中，勇敢战斗，使这些积极分子在掀起斗、批、改的高潮中起了很大作用。宣传队还从爱护革命小将出发，对个别错误比较严重、思想阻力较大的群众组织的头头和群众，反复做耐心细致的思想政治工作，积极引导他们用毛主席的最新指示对照和检查自己，勇敢地进行自我批评，鼓励他们在斗、批、改中立新功。宣传队这样做的结果，很快团结了全校大多数群众，孤立并狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    宣传队在工作过程中深深感到，要搞好学校的斗、批、改，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，扫除各种非无产阶级思想。
    宣传队遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，组织全校革命师生员工大办落实毛主席最新指示的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班上，宣传队帮助大家认真学习毛主席的各项最新指示，狠批资产阶级反动的“多中心即无中心论”，狠批山头主义、宗派主义，同时狠批了对毛主席最新指示学用不一致、口是心非的资产阶级坏学风。
    广大革命师生员工通过学习和批判，深刻认识到，对待毛主席的最新指示，学而不用、言行不一，或者断章取义地为自己的小山头、小团体利益服务，这是对毛主席的不忠，这是根本立场问题。他们纷纷写大字报、决心书，表示要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，学用一致，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，坚决搞好教育革命。
    在这同时，宣传队成员还以自己在旧社会深受剥削压迫的血泪史，以及自己活学活用毛泽东思想的切身体会，向广大师生员工进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在领导学校斗、批、改中，以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，充分发扬工人阶级和解放军立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，敢于斗争，勇于负责的高贵品质，为革命师生树立了良好榜样，从而进一步发动和武装了广大革命群众，对开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，促进斗、批、改起了很大作用。
    宣传队进校不久，校内一小撮阶级敌人到处煽阴风，点邪火，妄图挑拨革命师生同宣传队的关系，破坏斗、批、改。宣传队了解到这种情况，立即针锋相对地在大会、小会上狠狠揭露和批判，使革命师生更增强了对敌斗争的信心。
    在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的强有力的领导和推动下，现在江西省电力学校的广大革命师生员工，已经投入了轰轰烈烈的斗批改高潮。他们决心紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，认真落实毛主席的各项最新指示，更好地团结对敌，许多革命师生员工说，工人宣传队给我们带来了毛泽东思想，带来了无产阶级的高贵品质，带来了对敌斗争的锐利武器，工人宣传队就是好！我们一定要恭恭敬敬地向工人阶级学习，彻底改造世界观，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
