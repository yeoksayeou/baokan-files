A Pakistani government friendship delegation, led by Advisor to the President of Pakistan, Sayyid Fidahasan, arrived in Beijing today by special plane from Shanghai. The delegation was invited by the Chinese government to participate in the celebrations of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and to conduct a friendly visit.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, representatives of the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, revolutionary masses, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army welcomed the distinguished guests from the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan at the airport. The welcoming crowd numbered over 2,000 people, holding up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of President Ayub Khan, and the national flags of China and Pakistan, expressing their firm support for the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression.

After stepping off the plane, Advisor Sayyid Fidahasan and the entire delegation, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, walked around the field to meet with the welcoming crowd. At this time, the welcoming crowd beat drums and gongs, shouting slogans: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan!" "Firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression!" "Firmly support the Kashmiri people's struggle for national self-determination!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique!"

The members of the Pakistani government friendship delegation include: Mrs. Sayyid Fidahasan, Minister of Communications of West Pakistan Muhammad Khan Junajcho, Minister of Law of East Pakistan Abdul Haye Chaudhry, National Assembly member Shah Azizur Rahman, National Assembly member and Secretary of the Parliament Sayyid Ali Asghar Shah, Nurul Islam Sikdar, Rafiq Saygor, Mrs. Rafiq Saygor, East Pakistan Provincial Assembly member Ayisha Sadar, Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture of West Pakistan Amir Ahmad Khan.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included officials from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant parties, including Luo Guibo, Lin Haiyun, Xie Huai, and Wu Zhong.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan and other diplomatic staff from the embassy also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, who was specially sent to Shanghai to welcome Advisor Sayyid Fidahasan, arrived in Beijing on the same plane.

Today, when the Pakistani guests passed through Shanghai, leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, representatives of the Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, and revolutionary masses went to the airport to welcome and see them off.

Vice Premier Chen Yi held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Pakistani government friendship delegation led by Advisor to the President of Pakistan, Sayyid Fidahasan.

At the banquet filled with friendly atmosphere, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Advisor Sayyid Fidahasan spoke successively, wishing for the continuous development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan and the friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm welcome to the Pakistani guests. He said that China and Pakistan are friendly neighboring countries. Our two peoples have close friendship. Our friendship has been developed and consolidated in the common struggle against colonialism and expansionism, and is full of vitality. Our friendship is an important factor in maintaining peace in this region. The Chinese people will, as always, strive together with the Pakistani people to maintain and strengthen Sino-Pakistani friendship.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that now, U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are colluding to try to redivide the world. They regard other countries and peoples as objects of plunder, arbitrarily slaughtering and trampling them. Their ambitions are arrogant. But in reality, they are very weak. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." As long as the peoples of the world strengthen their unity and persist in struggle, they will surely achieve victory in the great cause of opposing imperialism and colonialism and fighting for and maintaining national independence. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggles of the revolutionary peoples of all countries, firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle against colonialism and expansionism, and firmly support the Kashmiri people's just struggle for national self-determination.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our people have, after more than two years of hard struggle, already achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, realizing that the whole country, except for Taiwan Province, is red. Now, our people are striving to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in accordance with the series of latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. He expressed his belief that the visit of the Pakistani guests this time will surely make new contributions to further strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries and promoting the friendship between the two peoples.

Advisor Sayyid Fidahasan, in his speech, conveyed the warm greetings of President Ayub Khan to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Chinese people. He said that the friendly relations between Pakistan and China fully demonstrate that our two peoples sincerely wish to live in peace. We are confident that this relationship is firmly established on the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, mutual respect for sovereignty, and friendly cooperation. Pakistan is determined to strive for the further consolidation of this relationship.

Sayyid Fidahasan strongly condemned India's hostile policy towards Pakistan, pointing out that India's continuous large-scale war preparations pose a serious threat to Pakistan and other neighboring countries. He said that the Pakistani people's determination to maintain freedom and territorial integrity and not to be threatened by any aggression is unshakable.

He pointed out that the Chinese government and people gave firm support to Pakistan's national integrity when it was threatened, and have consistently supported the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for national self-determination. He expressed that Pakistan's determination to help the people of Jammu and Kashmir exercise their inalienable right to self-determination is unshakable.

Sayyid Fidahasan praised the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in various fields. He expressed his belief that the Chinese people will achieve greater victories and achievements.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan and diplomatic staff from the embassy were also invited to the banquet.

Those attending the banquet included representatives of the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, leaders of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and various revolutionary mass organizations, and leaders from relevant departments.

    赛义德·菲达·哈桑强烈谴责印度对巴基斯坦采取敌视政策，指出印度连续不断的大规模的战争准备，给巴基斯坦和其他邻国造成严重威胁。他说，巴基斯坦人民维护自由和领土完整，不受任何侵略威胁的决心是坚定不移的。
    他指出，中国政府和中国人民在巴基斯坦国家的完整受到威胁的时刻给了他们坚决的支持，对查谟和克什米尔人民争取民族自决权的斗争也给了一贯的支持。他表示，巴基斯坦人民帮助查谟和克什米尔人民行使他们不可剥夺的自决权的决心是不可动摇的。
