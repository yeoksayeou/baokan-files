Tokyo, September 18 (Xinhua) - Two hundred and fifty fishermen from Nanxiang Town in the southern part of Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, have been waging a courageous struggle in recent days to prevent the Sato reactionary government from carrying out rocket launch tests at the behest of U.S. imperialism.

On September 12 and 13, fishermen from Nanxiang Town rowed their boats into the restricted sea area off the coast of Kagawa Town in Kagoshima Prefecture, where the rocket booster was scheduled to land, to block the rocket launch test planned by the Japanese reactionary government.

On the morning of the 17th, the fishermen launched another round of struggle. They boarded eighteen fishing boats and entered the restricted sea area near Tanegashima, defying the obstruction of the reactionary government's patrol boats and continued fishing, forcing the reactionary authorities to cancel the rocket launch scheduled for the morning of the 17th. The fishermen also posted slogans in Nanxiang Town reading: "We absolutely oppose turning Tanegashima into a rocket base," "With our united struggle, we will protect the Tanegashima fishing grounds."

Kathmandu, September 16 (Xinhua) - More than five hundred Nepalese students held a demonstration in Kathmandu on the evening of the 15th to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam and oppose U.S. interference in Nepal's higher education institutions.

The demonstrators angrily shouted slogans such as: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Oppose the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam!" "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people!" They also shouted: "Oppose U.S. interference in Nepal's higher education institutions." They strongly protested against the high-handed measures taken by the U.S. against those Nepalese institutions that supposedly received "U.S. aid."

Previously, another group of Nepalese students also held a demonstration in Kathmandu to protest against U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam. The demonstrators shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with the decision-makers of the U.S. government!"

	Japanese farmers from Sanrizuka in Chiba Prefecture, who are fighting against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, along with workers and students, held a large rally in Sanrizuka Park to express their determination to continue the struggle to stop the airport's construction.
