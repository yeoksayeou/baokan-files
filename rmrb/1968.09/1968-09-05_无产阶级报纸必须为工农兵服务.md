Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Before the extinction of classes, all newspapers, periodicals, radio, and news agencies have class character and serve a definite class." In class society, newspapers are always tools of class struggle. There is not, and cannot be, any newspaper that is above classes. Newspapers of all classes serve the interests of their respective classes. Our proletarian newspapers must serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the newspapers play a tremendous role in uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev spouts nonsense, saying that newspapers are "for the readers" and "for those who read the newspapers."

"Readers" are divided by class. A single newspaper will elicit different reactions from different classes. The People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the People's Liberation Army Daily have published Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the workers' class leading everything. Different classes have fundamentally different reactions to this. We, the working class, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. We firmly support and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. However, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, as well as a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the country, are terrified and enraged by Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They spread rumors, slander, stir up trouble, and create chaos, vainly attempting to reverse the wheel of history and obstruct societal progress.

Look! The love and hate of these two classes of readers are so starkly different. How can a single newspaper serve two opposing classes simultaneously? The "readers" and "those who read the newspapers" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about are merely a paper-thin disguise, easily torn apart! The "readers" of the Chinese Khrushchev are imperialists, revisionists, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The Chinese Khrushchev wants to fight for a position in our proletarian newspapers for his "readers," demanding that our newspapers say "capitalists are good" and "workers are bad."

What is good about capitalists? In the old society where people exploited people, we, the working class, suffered endless oppression and exploitation from the capitalists. They treated us workers like cattle. We worked from dawn to dusk, toiling to the point of exhaustion, yet we still couldn't eat our fill or dress warmly. Many were driven to desperation, forced to sell their children, and their families were ruined. This is the "goodness" that the flesh-eating, blood-drinking capitalists showed to us, the working class. We will never forget this blood debt from generation to generation.

The Chinese Khrushchev distorts right and wrong, confuses black and white, and praises the "goodness" of capitalists, attempting to turn our proletarian newspapers into propaganda tools for restoring capitalism, clearing the way for their capitalist restoration.

The proletarian press must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long seen through the Chinese Khrushchev's wolfish ambitions and will never allow his dreams to come true. We must thoroughly criticize his counter-revolutionary revisionist line on journalism, eliminate its poison, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high over the battlefield of journalism.

### 无产阶级报纸必须为工农兵服务

    无产阶级报纸必须为工农兵服务
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。”在阶级社会中，报纸总是阶级斗争的工具。世界上决没有什么超阶级的报纸，各个阶级的报纸统统都是为本阶级的利益服务的。我们无产阶级的报纸，就是要为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，使报纸起到团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的巨大作用。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么报纸是“为读者服务的”，“为看报的人服务的”。
    “读者”是划分阶级的。一张报纸，不同的阶级看了就有不同的反应。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表的毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的一系列最新指示，不同的阶级就有根本不同的反应。我们工人阶级最忠于毛主席，对毛主席的最新指示，坚决拥护，坚决照办。为了全面落实毛主席的最新指示，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。可是，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，以及国内一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们对毛主席的最新指示吓得胆战心惊，恨得咬牙切齿，于是到处造谣诽谤，挑拨离间，兴风作浪，妄想扭转历史车轮，阻挡社会的前进。
    你看！这两个阶级的读者爱憎是多么鲜明的不同。同一张报纸哪里能够同时为两个对立的阶级服务呢？中国赫鲁晓夫所谓的“为读者服务”、“为看报的人服务”，只不过是一层纸糊的伪装，一捅就破！中国赫鲁晓夫的“读者”，就是帝国主义、修正主义和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为他的“读者”在我们无产阶级的报纸上争地位，要我们的报纸说“资本家好”，说“工人不好”。
    资本家哪一点好？在那人吃人的旧社会，我们工人阶级受尽了资本家的压迫和剥削，资本家把我们工人当牛马，我们工人起早搭黑，累死累活，到头来吃不饱穿不暖，多少人被逼得走投无路，卖儿卖女，家破人亡。这就是吃人肉喝人血的资本家对待我们工人阶级的“好处”，我们世世代代永远不会忘记这笔血泪账。
    中国赫鲁晓夫颠倒是非，混淆黑白，吹捧什么“资本家好”，就是妄想让无产阶级报纸成为复辟资本主义的舆论工具，为他们复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    无产阶级报纸必须为工农兵服务。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，早就看穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心，绝对不允许他的美梦实现。我们就是要彻底批判他的反革命修正主义新闻路线，肃清其流毒，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍新闻阵地。
