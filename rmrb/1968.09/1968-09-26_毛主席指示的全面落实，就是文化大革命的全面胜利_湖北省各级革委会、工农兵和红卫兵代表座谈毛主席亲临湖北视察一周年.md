We will fight a brilliant battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

A Great Revolutionary Practice, a Glorious Historical Document

Zeng Siyang (President of Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Our most beloved great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, with the boldness and greatness of a proletarian revolutionary, personally initiated and led the great proletarian cultural revolution that shocked the world. This great revolution is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. This revolution aims to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, establish Mao Zedong Thought, transform people's worldviews, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship, consolidate and develop the socialist system. Chairman Mao commands us in battle, making us achieve one victory after another. Chairman Mao pays great attention to the cultural revolution in Hubei and Wuhan. On July 16, 1966, just as the trumpet call for the great proletarian cultural revolution was sounded, Chairman Mao came to Wuhan and swam in the Yangtze River, inspecting the cultural revolutionary army of the Wuhan region on the Yangtze River, personally igniting the blazing fire of the cultural revolution in Wuhan. From then on, the people of Wuhan, like the people of the entire country, followed Chairman Mao forward in great winds and waves.

The enemies of the proletariat will stubbornly come out to perform, which is an objective law that is not subject to human will. In this political revolution, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Wuhan region was extremely sharp and intense. Several jumping jacks performed and exposed themselves, brutally suppressing the proletarian revolutionary faction, thinking they could extinguish the blazing fire of the great proletarian cultural revolution. At this critical moment of struggle, our beloved red sun Chairman Mao, with his wise decisions and decisive measures, dispersed the dark clouds that had been raging for a while, and the class enemies collapsed instantly. Under the personal leadership and care of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the great support of the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan, with an overwhelming force, smashed the desperate counterattacks of the class enemies and achieved great victories in the great struggle between the two classes.

We have won, but what should we do next? This is another important juncture. Our great leader Chairman Mao inspected North China, Central China, and East China, investigating the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities. During the inspection, Chairman Mao gave extremely important instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution in various regions. Chairman Mao pointed out: The situation of the proletarian cultural revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. We seriously studied and understood this instruction, correcting some muddled ideas about the situation. We realized that if we do not use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and understand the situation, we cannot see the essence and the mainstream. Chairman Mao, with his far-sighted vision, saw the good situation in the chaos of the class enemies' desperate counterattacks, pointing out the excellent situation. In fact, the "chaos" was chaos for the enemies, tempering the masses, turning bad things into good things. Because we implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the cultural revolution in Hubei Province and the Wuhan region has always advanced victoriously along the course guided by Chairman Mao. We deeply felt that as long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, our direction will be clear, our eyes will be bright, our confidence will be strong, and we will be able to grasp the initiative to win.

Rao Xingli (National Agricultural Labor Model, Vice President of Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee), Xia Bangyin (Worker, Member of the Standing Committee of Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Vice President of the Revolutionary Committee of Hanshan Steel Rolling Mill):

Chairman Mao stands the highest and sees the farthest. During his inspection of the three regions, he wisely pointed out: In a few more months, the overall situation will be even better.

Today, Hubei Province presents a vibrant revolutionary scene everywhere. Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popular, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are spread throughout the province, becoming more and more numerous and better and better. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought is firmly supported and implemented; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought is firmly resisted and opposed, which has become the action guideline of the broad revolutionary masses. The people of the entire province use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to launch a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Central China and Hubei, such as Tao Zhu and Wang Renzhong. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is even more deeply rooted in people's hearts, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" by system, industry, and class. The industrial production of the entire province is rising steadily, transportation is smooth, summer grain and early and middle-season rice have been harvested abundantly, and cotton and late autumn crops are also expected to be bountiful. All of this fully proves Chairman Mao's brilliant foresight. The wheels of history are rolling forward exactly as Chairman Mao has guided.

Following Chairman Mao is Victory

Ma Tingxi (Vice President of Jiaoyu County Revolutionary Committee):

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution fully proves this great truth. Last July, when our county had already formed a great alliance and a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," some comrades, due to the "selfishness" of the bourgeoisie, hooked up with the famous large organizations in the province, trying to borrow external forces to compete for the "core" in the local area. The great alliance that had been achieved in the entire county was facing the danger of splitting. At this moment, the great teaching of Chairman Mao, "There is no fundamental conflict of interest within the working class," was conveyed, and everyone realized that hooking up with large organizations from other places was not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. They immediately cut ties with the external organizations, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance. At the same time, following Chairman Mao's correct instructions on handling cadres, a batch of cadres were quickly released, and the first county-level revolutionary committee in the province was established, followed by the achievement of a red county.

Fang Ming (Commander of Wuhan Garrison, President of Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee):

The practical struggle of the proletarian cultural revolution has made us deeply understand: the closer the cultural revolution is to comprehensive victory, the deeper and more complex the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines becomes. A handful of class enemies will never be willing to accept their death. When we oppose rightist capitulationism, rightist splitism, rightist opportunism, and smash the rightist reversal wind, they will blow a "reversal" wind, directly aiming at our newly born revolutionary committees and the great People's Liberation Army; when we firmly oppose the reactionary "multi-center is no center" theory, they will appear in an ultra-leftist guise, viciously attacking the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the plots of a handful of class enemies have one by one suffered shameful failures. However, it is very necessary to seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of class struggle to complete new battle tasks. We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," raise our revolutionary vigilance, timely expose the new tricks played by class enemies, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and continuously eliminate interference from the right and ultra-left, so as to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comprehensively Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Launching a High Tide of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

Zhang Tixue (Vice President of Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Recently, we have followed the great teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao, "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around, look around, insist on the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be a student of the masses," and conducted investigations in some counties, districts, communes, and production teams. We have talked with some poor and lower-middle peasants, seen the great revolutionary situation in the vast rural areas, seen the earth-shaking changes brought by the proletarian cultural revolution to the vast rural areas of our province, the unprecedentedly high socialist consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, the unprecedentedly consolidated socialist front in rural areas, the full play of the revolutionary authority of various levels of leading cadres, and the unprecedentedly good production situation. On the joyous day of celebrating the one-year anniversary of our great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the 32 million people of our province, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, have, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," won another great victory of a red province.

Zhang Zhaojian (Vice President of Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee):

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with a combination of three elements, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office personnel, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and transformation generally go through these stages." This is our current central task and must be fought well.

Struggle, criticism, and transformation are the proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, transforming the world in the image of the proletariat. Therefore, proletarian leadership must be insisted on. The practical experience of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering schools and leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation has proven that proletarian leadership of the struggle, criticism, and transformation is more thorough than that of intellectuals, because the proletariat was most oppressed and exploited in the old society, is closest to Chairman Mao, follows Chairman Mao most closely, and does whatever Chairman Mao says, being able to implement Chairman Mao's instructions item by item. Therefore, in completing the arduous task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they are not afraid of difficulties, dare to take on heavy responsibilities, and are the most thorough in revolution.

Yang Heqing (Member of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Old Worker of the 3510 Factory):

We follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committees, the first workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Wuhan, marched into Wuhan Iron and Steel Institute in a grand manner.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Institute is a new higher education institution established after liberation. For a long time, due to the stubborn promotion of the reactionary bourgeois education line by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the institute, the poison was deep. In the proletarian cultural revolution, a handful of class enemies again instigated the masses to fight the masses, and the two factions were in long-term opposition and could not unite, making it a famous "difficult-to-handle" unit. All members of our propaganda team lived, worked, studied, and struggled together with the revolutionary teachers and students, quickly establishing feelings with all the revolutionary teachers and students in the institute, eliminating ideological barriers. We also universally set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, inviting teachers and students from both factions to participate, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, conducting education on the comparison between the old and new societies, effectively raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who were hiding behind the scenes and conducting sabotage activities. In this way, the entire institute quickly achieved revolutionary great unity by class.

From the struggle practice of Wuhan Iron and Steel Institute, we deeply feel that proletarian leadership is to lead with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We must further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's series of proletarian policies, strictly distinguish between the two types of different nature contradictions, unite all forces that can be united, wholeheartedly give intellectuals re-education, help revolutionary teachers and students walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, and build a team of proletarian intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Yang Daoyuan (Red Guard, Vice President of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee), Zhang Liguo (Red Guard, Vice President of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we revolutionary Red Guards, holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," came out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, making some contributions in the early and middle stages of the cultural revolution. However, due to the long-term influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line promoted by Liu Shaoqi, we also relaxed the transformation of our worldviews, and thus, at the critical moment of the deepening of the revolution, we showed incompleteness and vacillation in the revolution. Practice has proven that proletarian leadership and the participation of the working class are necessary to carry the revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao's recent series of latest instructions on the educational revolution have pointed out the direction and path of the educational revolution, which are sharp weapons to thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system.

Jiang Yi (Member of the Standing Committee of Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "seriously do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation," the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural people's communes across the province is surging. The reliable ally of the working class, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm, determined to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fight a good battle of rural struggle, criticism, and transformation, seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, and build a solid socialist rural front.

Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasonable, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." From the recent investigation of a few places in the countryside, I found that a prominent feature of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural people's communes is to first focus on and intensify the revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points as the commander," and "material incentives" promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renzhong in the countryside. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, in the process of struggle, criticism, and transformation, pay great attention to investigation and research, and strictly implement Chairman Mao's series of policies on rural people's communes, striking at the sabotage from the right and ultra-left by a handful of class enemies.

    毛主席指示的全面落实，就是文化大革命的全面胜利
    湖北省各级革委会、工农兵和红卫兵代表座谈毛主席亲临湖北视察一周年
    本报讯　在我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区文化大革命一周年的光辉日子里，湖北省各级革命委员会的部分同志和工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、人民解放军指战员的代表，举行座谈会，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席亲临湖北视察一周年，颂扬我们心中的红太阳毛主席的伟大决策和英明预见，尽情畅谈毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在湖北的伟大胜利。到会同志回顾一年来在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下的战斗历程，深切地体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！一遍又一遍地纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”大家坚决表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，永远忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席，永远沿着毛主席亲手开辟的革命航道，乘东风，破巨浪，昂首阔步向前进，打一场斗、批、改的漂亮仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大的革命实践，光辉的历史文献
    曾思玉（湖北省革命委员会主任）：
    我们最敬爱的伟大统帅毛主席以无产阶级革命家的宏伟胆略和伟大气魄亲自发动和领导的、震惊全世界的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。这场大革命，就是要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，改造人的世界观，挖掉修正主义根子，以巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政，巩固和发展社会主义制度。毛主席他老人家指挥我们战斗，使我们取得一个接一个的胜利。毛主席对湖北、武汉的文化大革命，十分关怀。一九六六年七月十六日，无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角刚刚吹响，毛主席就来到武汉，并畅游长江，在长江上检阅了武汉地区文化革命大军，亲自点燃了武汉文化大革命的熊熊烈火。从此，武汉人民同全国人民一样，跟随毛主席在大风大浪中胜利前进。
    无产阶级的敌人要顽强地出来表演，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。在这场政治大革命中，武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争表现得十分尖锐、十分激烈，几个跳梁小丑大表演、大暴露，对无产阶级革命派，进行疯狂镇压，以为这样就能把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火扑灭下去。就在这个斗争的关键时刻，我们日日夜夜想念的红太阳毛主席以英明的决策，果断的措施，驱散了翻腾一时的乌云，阶级敌人顷刻土崩瓦解。在毛主席和林副主席亲自领导和关怀下，在全国无产阶级革命派巨大支持下，武汉无产阶级革命派，以排山倒海之势，粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，在两个阶级的大搏斗中，取得了伟大胜利。
    我们胜利了，下一步应该怎么走？又是一个重要关头。我们的伟大领袖毛主席视察了华北、中南和华东地区，调查了河北、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、浙江、上海等省市无产阶级文化大革命的情况。在视察过程中，毛主席对各地区的无产阶级文化大革命运动作了极为重要的指示。毛主席指出：全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。我们认真学习领会这一指示，纠正了一些对形势看法的糊涂观念。我们认识到，如果不用毛泽东思想去分析和认识形势，就看不到本质，看不到主流。毛主席高瞻远瞩，在阶级敌人疯狂反扑的“乱”中看到了治，指出了大好形势。其实“乱”是乱了敌人，锻炼了群众，坏事变成好事。由于我们执行了毛主席的一系列最新指示，使湖北省和武汉地区的文化大革命运动，始终沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。我们深深体会到：只要按毛主席的指示办事，我们前进方向就明，眼睛就亮，信心就足，就能掌握争取胜利的主动权。
    饶兴礼（全国农业劳动模范、湖北省革命委员会副主任）、夏邦银（工人、湖北省革命委员会常委、汉阳轧钢厂革命委员会副主任）：
    毛主席站得最高，看得最远，他老人家在视察三大区时就英明指出：再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。
    今天，湖北全省到处呈现一派生气蓬勃的大好革命景象。毛泽东思想空前大普及，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍及全省每个角落，越办越多，越办越好。凡是符合毛泽东思想的就坚决拥护，坚决照办；凡是违背毛泽东思想的，就坚决抵制，坚决反对，已经成了广大革命群众的行动准则。全省人民以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在中南、湖北的代理人陶铸、王任重之流，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，进一步巩固和发展了按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命的“三结合”。全省工业生产节节上升，交通运输畅通无阻，夏粮和早中稻获得大丰收，棉花和晚秋作物也丰收在望。所有这一切，完全证实了毛主席的天才预见，历史的车轮就是按照毛主席指引的方向滚滚向前。
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    马庭西（嘉鱼县革命委员会副主任）：
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，充分证明了这一伟大真理。去年七月，当我县已经形成革命大联合和革命三结合的大好局面时，有的同志由于资产阶级的“私”字作怪，便同全省有名的大组织挂钩，想借外力在本地区争“核心”。全县已经实现大联合的局面，面临着分裂的危险。正在这时，传来了毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的伟大教导，大家认识到和外地大组织挂钩是不符合毛泽东思想的，立即和外地组织脱钩，巩固了革命的大联合。同时遵循毛主席正确对待干部的指示，迅速解放了一批干部，在全省第一个建立了县一级的革命委员会，紧接着实现了全县一片红。
    方铭（人民解放军武汉警备区司令员、武汉市革命委员会主任）：
    无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深深懂得：文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争越是深入、复杂。一小撮阶级敌人总是不甘心他们的死亡。当我们反对右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾机会主义、粉碎右倾翻案妖风的时候，他们就大刮“平反”翻案妖风，直接把矛头对准我们新生的革命委员会和伟大的中国人民解放军；当我们坚决反对反动的“多中心即无中心论”的时候，他们又以极“左”的面目出现，恶毒攻击以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋一个一个地遭到了可耻的失败。但是，认真总结阶级斗争的经验教训，对我们完成新的战斗任务是十分必需的。我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，提高革命的警惕性，及时识破阶级敌人玩弄的新花招，以毛泽东思想为武器，不断排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，这样才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    全面落实毛主席最新指示，掀起斗、批、改高潮
    张体学（湖北省革命委员会副主任）：
    最近，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的伟大教导，到一些县、区、社、队作了调查，找了一些贫下中农座谈，看到了广大农村一片大好革命形势，看到了无产阶级文化大革命给我省广大农村带来的翻天覆地的变化，广大贫下中农的社会主义觉悟空前提高，农村社会主义阵地空前巩固，各级领导班子的革命权威充分发挥，生产形势空前大好。在欢庆伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区一周年的大喜日子里，我省三千二百万人民满怀对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，又夺来了全省一片红的伟大胜利。
    张昭剑（武汉市革命委员会副主任）：
    毛主席最近指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”这是我们当前的中心任务，必须认真打好这一仗。
    斗、批、改，就是工人阶级在共产党、毛主席的领导下，按照工人阶级的面貌改造世界。因此，必须坚持工人阶级领导。从工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校，领导学校斗、批、改的实践经验证明，工人阶级领导斗、批、改，就是比知识分子搞得彻底，因为工人阶级在旧社会受压迫、受剥削最深，对毛主席最亲，跟毛主席最紧，毛主席怎么说就怎么做，能条条落实毛主席的指示。因此在完成斗、批、改的艰巨任务中，不怕困难，敢挑重担，革命最彻底。
    杨和庆（武汉工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、三五一○工厂老工人）：
    我们遵照毛主席的伟大战略部署，在湖北省和武汉市革命委员会的领导下，武汉市第一支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡开进了武汉钢铁学院。
    武汉钢铁学院是解放后新建的高等学校。长期以来，由于院内一小撮走资派顽固推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的资产阶级教育路线，流毒很深。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人又挑动群众斗群众，两派长期对立，一直联合不起来，是有名的“老大难”单位。我们全体宣传队员与革命师生同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，很快同全院革命师生建立了感情，消除了思想上的隔膜。我们还普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，吸收两派师生参加，学习毛主席一系列最新指示，进行新旧社会回忆对比的教育，有效地提高了他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，把一小撮藏在幕后进行破坏活动的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派揪出来进行了批判和斗争。这样，全院很快按照班级实现了革命大联合。
    从武汉钢铁学院的斗争实践中，我们深深体会到，工人阶级的领导，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用毛主席的一系列最新指示进行领导。我们一定在斗争中进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一系列无产阶级政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，满腔热情地给知识分子以再教育，帮助革命师生走同工农兵结合的道路，建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级知识分子队伍。
    杨道远（红卫兵小将、省革命委员会副主任）、张立国（红卫兵小将、省革命委员会副主任）：
    在伟大领袖毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，我们革命的红卫兵小将，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中杀出来，在文化大革命初期和中期作出了一些贡献。但由于长期受中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线影响，又放松了对自己世界观的改造，因而在革命深入发展的关键时刻，就表现出革命的不彻底性和动摇性。实践证明，必须要有工人阶级领导，工人群众参加，才能把革命进行到底。毛主席最近发表的一系列有关教育革命的最新指示，指出了学校教育革命的方向和道路，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的锐利武器。
    姜一（湖北省革命委员会常委）：
    在毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召下，全省农村人民公社的斗、批、改高潮正在蓬勃兴起，工人阶级可靠同盟军广大贫下中农满怀革命豪情，决心全面落实毛主席的最新指示，打好农村斗、批、改这一仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，建立巩固的社会主义农村阵地。
    毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”从最近我到农村调查几个地方的情况看，农村人民公社进行斗、批、改的一个鲜明特点，就是首先大抓狠抓革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北的代理人王任重之流在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等一套反革命修正主义路线的流毒。广大贫下中农、基层干部在进行斗、批、改中，十分注意调查研究，十分注意贯彻执行毛主席主持制定的有关农村人民公社一系列的方针政策，打击一小撮阶级敌人从右的和极“左”方面来的破坏。
