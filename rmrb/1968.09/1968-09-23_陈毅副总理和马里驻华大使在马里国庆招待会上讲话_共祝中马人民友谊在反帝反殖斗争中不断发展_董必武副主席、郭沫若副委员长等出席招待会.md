Mali's Ambassador to China, Gando, held a reception today to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Mali.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, and leaders of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, representatives of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital, leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, and representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the garrison troops in Beijing were invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, filled with a friendly atmosphere, Ambassador Gando and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke. They jointly wished for the friendship between the peoples of China and Mali to continue to develop in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

In his speech, Ambassador Gando introduced the significance of Mali's people achieving national independence and the efforts they have made to build their country. The ambassador enthusiastically praised the friendly relations between Mali and China. He said that the two countries trust and support each other in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and their relations have developed harmoniously with a bright future because they are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The ambassador highly praised the assistance China has provided to Mali, pointing out that China's assistance has been effective and has helped the people of Mali maintain and consolidate Mali's independent national democratic construction. He said that China's assistance is the purest form of proletarian internationalism and Marxism-Leninism. He took this opportunity to express his sincere thanks to the Chinese Party, the Chinese government, and the great Chinese people.

Ambassador Gando said that Mali firmly stands with its African brothers in the struggle against colonialism, racism, and the apartheid system. The people of Mali resolutely support the struggles of the peoples of all countries for national liberation and the maintenance of independence. We have and will continue to condemn the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, the armed invasion of the Middle East, and other places.

The ambassador said, "We reaffirm to all the freedom fighters of Africa, Asia, and Latin America: The correct statement by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' is deeply engraved in the hearts of the Malian people."

He said, "The Malian people and the Malian government regard the great cause of the Chinese people as their own. In Mali, we closely follow the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong. This event, which has made the imperialists and their lackeys panic-stricken, has achieved extremely great victories, making China advance courageously. The establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces across China is a great victory for the Chinese people. We express our congratulations."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, extended warm congratulations to the people and government of Mali. He praised the efforts and achievements of the Malian people in maintaining national independence, developing the national economy, and national culture over the past eight years since they won independence.

He said, "The current world revolutionary situation is very good and getting better. The capitalist world led by the United States is facing deeper financial and economic crises, and their days are not good. The modern revisionist group is also facing serious internal contradictions, fragmentation, and their days are not good either. Recently, the Soviet revisionist group's invasion of Czechoslovakia has fully exposed the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist clique's social imperialism, and it has been strongly condemned by revolutionary people all over the world."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "These two so-called 'superpowers,' the United States and the Soviet Union, are colluding with each other, one sending over 500,000 troops to occupy South Vietnam, the other sending over 600,000 troops to occupy Czechoslovakia. They are conspiring together while also competing with each other, attempting to divide spheres of influence and re-divide the world to dominate the world situation and promote neo-colonialism. The crazy aggression of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists does not indicate their strength; on the contrary, it is a manifestation of their guilt and desperation. In human history, any aggressor who goes crazy for a while will ultimately meet a bad end. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have already prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be far off. Our great leader Chairman Mao once said in 1949: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries, and they are doomed to such an end. This is a Marxist law.'"

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Thank you to our Malian friends for praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has now achieved decisive victories nationwide. Except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The whole country is red. China has never been so united, so consolidated, and so strong. The situation across the country is excellent. We believe that after this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be able to build our motherland even stronger. Our people will have more power to smash any anti-China conspiracies by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists and their lackeys, and will have more power to support the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world."

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the new developments in the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Mali, pointing out that the anti-imperialist struggle of the Malian people is a support and assistance to the Chinese people. He said, "On the basis of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and through our joint efforts, the fighting friendship and friendly cooperation between our two peoples will continue to develop."

Also invited to attend the reception were relevant officials from the government, the People's Liberation Army, and other relevant departments, including Xiao Jingguang, Qiao Guanghua, Ma Wenbo, Xie Huaiyi, Jia Shi, Zhang Xianyue, Zhao Qimin, Tan Jiashu, Zhang Nansheng, Zhou Rongguo, Ding Xilin, and others.

The Foreign Minister of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Zale, who is visiting Beijing, and envoys from various countries to China, also attended the reception.

    陈毅副总理和马里驻华大使在马里国庆招待会上讲话
    共祝中马人民友谊在反帝反殖斗争中不断发展
    董必武副主席、郭沫若副委员长等出席招待会
    新华社二十二日讯  马里驻中国大使甘多今天举行招待会，庆祝马里共和国成立八周年。
    董必武副主席，陈毅副总理，郭沫若副委员长，以及北京市革命委员会的负责人，首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队代表，北京市各革命群众组织的负责成员，驻京部队五好战士代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    在充满友好气氛的招待会上，甘多大使和陈毅副总理先后讲话。他们共祝中马两国人民友谊在反帝反殖斗争中不断发展。
    甘多大使在讲话中介绍了马里人民取得民族独立的意义，以及他们为建设国家所进行的努力。大使热烈赞扬马中两国的友好关系。他说，马中两国在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中是互相信任、互相支持的，两国的关系得到和谐的发展，前景光辉灿烂，因为这种关系是以和平共处五项原则为基础的。
    大使高度评价中国向马里提供的援助，指出中国的援助是卓有成效的，而且它帮助马里人民维护和巩固了马里的独立的民族民主建设方针。中国的援助是具有最纯粹的无产阶级国际主义、马克思列宁主义风格的援助。他说，我借此机会向中国党、中国政府和伟大的中国人民表示热忱的感谢。
    甘多大使说，马里坚决站在为反对殖民主义、种族主义和种族隔离制度而斗争的非洲兄弟一边。马里人民坚决支持世界各国人民为争取民族解放和维护独立进行的斗争。我们过去和现在都谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，谴责武装入侵中东和其它地方。
    大使说，我们向全体非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲的自由战士们重申：中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的正确论断“枪杆子里面出政权”，这是铭刻在马里人民心坎里的信念。
    他说，马里人民和马里政府把伟大的中国人民的事业看成他们自己的事业。在马里，我们密切关注着由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。这一使帝国主义及其仆从们惊惶失措的事件，已取得了极其伟大的胜利，使中国勇往直前。中国全国各省都建立革命委员会，这是中国人民的伟大胜利，我们表示祝贺。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国人民和中国政府，向马里人民和马里政府致以热烈的祝贺，赞扬马里人民赢得独立的八年来，为反帝、反殖、维护民族独立、发展民族经济和民族文化进行了不懈的努力，不断取得新的成就和胜利。
    他说，目前世界革命形势一片大好，而且越来越好。以美国为首的资本主义世界，财政金融危机越来越深，他们的日子很不好过。现代修正主义集团内部矛盾重重，四分五裂，日子也很不好过。最近，苏修集团出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，充分暴露了苏修叛徒集团社会帝国主义的狰狞面目，遭到全世界革命人民的愤怒谴责。
    陈毅副总理说，美苏这两个所谓“超级大国”，狼狈为奸，一个出兵五十多万占领越南南方，一个出兵六十多万占领捷克斯洛伐克。他们相互勾结而又互相争夺，妄图划分势力范围、重新瓜分世界，来主宰世界局势，推行新殖民主义。美帝、苏修这样疯狂地进行侵略，并不表示他们的强大，恰恰相反，这是他们理亏心虚、强行挣扎的表现。在人类历史上，任何疯狂一时的侵略者，最后都是没有好下场的。美帝、苏修已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太远了。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席在一九四九年就曾说过：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”
    陈毅副总理说，感谢马里朋友赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，目前已经在全国范围内取得了决定性的胜利。全国除台湾省以外，二十九个省、市和自治区已经全部成立了革命委员会，全国山河一片红。中国从来没有象今天这样团结，这样巩固，这样强大。全国形势一片大好。我们相信，经过这场无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，一定能够把我们的祖国建设得更加强大，我国人民会更有力量粉碎美帝和苏修及其走狗们所进行的任何反华阴谋活动，会更有力量支援世界各地被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争。
    陈毅副总理赞扬中国和马里两国人民战斗友谊的新发展，指出马里人民的反帝斗争是对中国人民的支持和援助。他说，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的基础上，在我们双方共同努力下，我们两国人民的战斗友谊和友好合作关系，将不断得到新的发展。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府有关部门、中国人民解放军和其他有关方面负责人萧劲光、乔冠华、马文波、谢怀德、贾石、张贤约、赵启民、谭家述、张南生、周荣国、丁西林等。
    正在北京访问的南也门人民共和国外交部长扎莱，各国驻中国的使节，也出席了招待会。
