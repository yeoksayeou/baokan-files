The Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District, Guangdong Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has emphasized proletarian politics, addressed the active thoughts of the masses, and conducted in-depth and meticulous thought political work using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, achieving initial experiences.

The Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District, Guangdong Province, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, has, in the process of intensifying class struggle and line struggle, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Combining the situation and tasks, it has conducted in-depth and meticulous thought political work to address the active thoughts of the masses, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve various problems in the masses' struggles, mobilizing all positive factors, and guiding and leading the broad revolutionary masses to advance along Mao Zedong's revolutionary line.

The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District have deeply felt that at this crucial moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly, class struggle is becoming more acute and complex, and the thoughts of the masses are changing quickly, with new problems constantly emerging. In this situation, how the Revolutionary Committee can, according to the characteristics of the movement, actively guide the masses to advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao is a new major issue. They brought this problem to the study of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." And Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "If you manage your thoughts well, everything good will emerge, and everything bad will be hidden. Political work has thousands and tens of thousands of things, but ideological work should be the first thing." The teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin gave them great enlightenment. They realized that the Revolutionary Committee must, to grasp class struggle and line struggle, become a strong command center for class struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, learn from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, constantly study the new characteristics, trends, and problems of class struggle, grasp the pulse of the masses' thoughts, and conduct timely and powerful living ideological education. They felt that every time Chairman Mao issued new instructions, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issued new battle orders, and the central newspapers and journals published important editorials and articles, the broad revolutionary masses would enthusiastically support and actively respond. But some people might also have some ideological problems; class enemies might also take the opportunity to interfere and cause trouble from the right or the "ultra-left" side. Therefore, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Revolutionary Committee must seize the opportunity, address the active thoughts of the masses and the new problems in the movement, timely arm the masses' minds with Mao Zedong Thought, conduct in-depth and meticulous thought political work, overcome ideological obstacles, and make the masses firmly advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The main leaders personally take charge, and the masses are mobilized to do the same, which is a prominent feature of the thought political work of the Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District. The members of the Revolutionary Committee firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." They regard going deep among the masses, actively propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and boldly solving some of the masses' ideological problems as fundamental attitudes towards the revolution and the masses, and as a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, they attach great importance to doing a good job in thought political work. Especially at critical moments, the main leaders of the Revolutionary Committee all go to the front line of class struggle, to the grassroots to talk with the masses, hold symposiums, use various methods, and through various channels, conduct investigations and research, timely grasp the trends of the masses' thoughts, seriously understand what the masses are thinking, what problems need to be solved, and what views there are on some major issues; at the same time, understand what new tricks the class enemies are playing. Then the members of the Revolutionary Committee study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings together, first solve their own ideological understanding problems. They use the method of class analysis taught by Chairman Mao to study and analyze the situation of the masses' thoughts and the trends of the class enemies, correctly distinguish between the two types of different contradictions, and correctly deal with different opinions among the masses. On the basis of unified understanding, they go to the masses to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, talk about the new characteristics, trends, and problems of class struggle, clearly state the stance, views, and attitudes of the Revolutionary Committee; point out what is right and what is wrong among the active thoughts of the masses; what to support and what to oppose; and thoroughly expose and criticize the conspiracies and counter-revolutionary fallacies spread by the class enemies. Since the establishment of the district Revolutionary Committee in January this year, they have conducted such active education with plans and purposes. Many county and commune Revolutionary Committees have also learned from the experience of the district Revolutionary Committee.

Closely combining the needs of the revolutionary situation and tasks, resolutely solving some realistic ideological problems, this is another feature of the thought work of the Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District. For example, when the Revolutionary Committee fully mobilized the masses to steadily, accurately, and fiercely attack a handful of class enemies, exposing traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists one by one, the class enemies, in order to shift the target of struggle and confuse the enemy lines, spread fallacies such as "this is the new bourgeois reactionary line" among the masses. Some people were deceived by some appearances and felt confused. Facing this problem, the Revolutionary Committee timely propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle to the masses, presented facts, explained reasons, exposed the counter-revolutionary crimes of those bad elements who had been exposed, organized the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, making everyone realize that it is completely necessary to implement proletarian dictatorship over these bad elements. At the same time, educate everyone to distinguish between enemies and friends, do not be fooled by the class enemies. If you start from bourgeois factionalism, regard enemies as friends, cannot distinguish between the few bad elements who have infiltrated the mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses, and point the spearhead at the newly born Revolutionary Committee, this is to stand on the enemy's side. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee used Mao Zedong Thought to timely expose the conspiracies of the class enemies, greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and greatly dampened the arrogance of the class enemies, making some people with confused ideas raise their class consciousness and quickly wake up, thus creating better conditions for further deepening the struggle against the enemies.

This spring, many rumors spread to the Huicheng area from outside, and some masses, unable to distinguish between true and false, believed them and used them as the basis for their actions. Some even spread them as "inside news" to gain popularity, causing confusion in the thoughts of some people. Facing this situation, the Revolutionary Committee propagated Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" to the masses, used facts to illustrate the serious harm of listening to rumors, guided everyone to use the perspective of class struggle and the method of class analysis to view this problem, making everyone realize that one of the means by which class enemies carry out sabotage and disruption is often to use rumors to spread rumors, create chaos, and interfere with the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. It is necessary to heighten revolutionary vigilance and never be fooled. All words and actions must be based on Chairman Mao's instructions. The source of the news must be based on the central newspapers and journals and the transmission of the Revolutionary Committee, and never listen to rumors or believe in rumors, making oneself go astray. This education was very effective. Many masses not only did not inquire about or spread rumors but also reported them, traced the source, and deeply criticized them, making rumors have no market among the masses.

Paying attention to promoting the advanced and setting examples, mobilizing positive factors, this is the third feature of the thought political work of the Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District. They believe that once the revolutionary spirit of the masses is established, there will be no room for evil winds. In the process of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they pay attention to using examples to lead the way at every step. Whether it is promoting revolutionary great unity, the three-in-one combination, carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary great criticism, or cleaning up the class ranks, they all pay attention to setting examples and mobilizing positive factors. In the aspect of revolutionary great criticism, they timely propagated the experience of Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County. Peace County had not been able to carry out revolutionary great criticism in the past, but after learning from the experience of Huangshandong, it quickly started.

With deep proletarian feelings and full revolutionary enthusiasm, helping comrades, this is the fourth feature of the thought political work of the Revolutionary Committee of Huicheng District. In May this year, a leader of a revolutionary mass organization wrote a letter to the Revolutionary Committee, reflecting his confused understanding of the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and saying that the realization of revolutionary great unity in Huicheng area was "too fast." The Revolutionary Committee, after research, believed that this was not just a personal problem but represented the thoughts of a part of the people. The Revolutionary Committee then seized this thought, organized the masses to discuss, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee went to organize report meetings and symposiums to raise the masses' understanding. At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee wholeheartedly helped the comrade who wrote the letter. The district Revolutionary Committee chairman held a symposium with the comrade who wrote the letter and those with the same views, presented facts, explained reasons, and used Chairman Mao's instructions to help them raise their class consciousness, making these comrades quickly realize their mistakes. The comrade who wrote the letter checked: "Bourgeois factionalism blinded my eyes, and proletarian party spirit made my eyes shine brightly." The Revolutionary Committee, in order to help a comrade, was not afraid of trouble, with a high sense of political responsibility for the revolution, repeatedly and patiently did the work. Once, the Revolutionary Committee, in order to help two comrades draw a clear line with the bad elements, explained the policy to them again and again, making these two comrades quickly wake up, turn around, and expose the bad leaders who had deceived them in the past.

    做好思想政治工作全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示
    广东省惠阳专区革委会在解放军帮助下，突出无产阶级政治，针对群众中的活思想，以毛泽东思想为武器进行深入细致的思想政治工作，取得初步经验
    本报讯　广东省惠阳专区革命委员会，在解放军的帮助下，在狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，结合形势任务，针对群众中的活思想，深入细致地进行思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想解决群众斗争中的各种问题，调动一切积极因素，引导和率领广大革命群众沿着毛主席的革命路线乘胜前进。
    惠阳专区革委会的同志在斗争中深深感到，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，革命形势发展迅速，阶级斗争更加尖锐复杂，群众的思想变化很快，新的问题也不断出现。在这种情况下，革委会如何根据运动发展的特点，积极引导群众沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，这是一个新的重大课题。他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席的教导：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”以及林副主席的指示：“管好了思想，一切好的东西都会涌现出来，一切坏的事情都会隐藏不住。政治工作有千件万件，思想工作应该是第一件。”毛主席和林副主席的教导给他们很大启示。他们认识到，革委会要抓好阶级斗争和路线斗争，成为阶级斗争坚强的指挥部，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，学习人民解放军的政治工作经验，经常研究阶级斗争的新特点、新动向、新问题，掌握群众思想的脉搏，及时有力地进行活的思想教育。他们体会到，每当毛主席发出了最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出了新的战斗号令，中央报刊发表了重要社论和文章，广大革命群众总是热烈拥护，积极响应。但也有些人会产生一些思想问题；阶级敌人也可能乘机从右的或极“左”的方面来进行干扰和捣乱。因此，要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，革委会必须抓住时机，针对群众中的活思想和运动中的新问题，及时用毛泽东思想去武装群众的头脑，深入细致地进行思想政治工作，克服思想障碍，才能使群众坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的方向前进。
    主要领导成员亲自抓，发动群众一齐抓，这是惠阳专区革委会抓思想政治工作的一个突出特点。革委会成员牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”他们把深入群众，积极宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，主动地大胆地解决一些群众的思想问题，看成是对革命、对群众的根本态度问题，看成是对毛主席的革命路线忠不忠的问题。因此，他们对抓好思想政治工作非常重视。特别是在关键时刻，革委会的主要领导成员都深入阶级斗争的第一线，到基层和群众谈心，开座谈会，采用多种方式，通过各条渠道，进行调查研究，及时掌握群众的思想动向，认真了解群众在想些什么，有些什么问题需要解决，对一些重大问题有些什么看法；同时了解阶级敌人在搞什么新花招。然后革委会的成员在一起学习毛主席的有关教导，首先解决本身的思想认识问题。他们用毛主席教导的阶级分析的方法，研究分析群众的思想情况和阶级敌人的动向，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确对待群众中的不同意见。在统一认识的基础上，他们到广大群众中去大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，大讲阶级斗争的新特点、新动向、新问题，旗帜鲜明地表明革委会的立场、观点和态度；对群众中的活思想，指出哪些是对的，哪些是错的；应该拥护什么，反对什么；对阶级敌人搞的阴谋和散布的反革命谬论，则给予彻底的揭露和批判。专区革委会今年一月成立以来，经常有计划有目的地进行这样的活教育。许多县、公社革委会也都学习专区革委会的经验。
    紧密结合革命形势和任务的需要，扎扎实实地解决一些现实思想问题，这是惠阳专区革委会抓好思想工作的又一特点。例如，正当革委会充分发动群众，稳、准、狠地向一小撮阶级敌人进攻，把叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子一个个揪出来的时候，阶级敌人为了转移斗争目标，混淆敌我界限，就在群众中散布什么“这是新的资产阶级反动路线”等谬论，有些人被一些假象所蒙蔽，感到迷惑不解。针对这个问题，革委会及时向群众宣传了毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，摆事实，讲道理，揭露了那些已被揪出的坏家伙的反革命罪行，组织群众开展革命大批判，使大家认识到对这些坏人实行无产阶级专政是完全必要的。同时，教育大家要分清敌我，不要上阶级敌人的当，如果从资产阶级派性出发，认敌为友，分不清混进群众组织的极少数坏人和广大革命群众，把阶级敌人拉到自己一起，而把矛头指向新生的革命委员会，这样就是站到敌人的立场上去了。革委会的同志用毛泽东思想及时揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，使一些有糊涂观念的人提高了阶级觉悟，很快醒悟过来，从而为进一步深入开展对敌斗争创造了更好的条件。
    今年春天，外地传到惠阳地区的小道消息很多，有些群众不辨真假，信以为真，并以此作为自己行动的依据，有的还作为“内幕新闻”，广为传播，借以哗众取宠，使一些人在思想上产生混乱。针对这种情况，革委会就向群众宣传毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用事实说明听小道消息的严重危害，引导大家用阶级斗争观点和阶级分析的方法来看待这个问题，使大家认识到，阶级敌人进行破坏和捣乱的手段之一，往往是利用小道消息来造谣惑众，制造混乱，干扰毛主席的一系列最新指示的落实。一定要提高革命警惕性，绝对不能上当，一切言论行动，都要以毛主席的指示为准则。消息的来源，要以中央报刊和革委会的传达为依据，绝不可道听途说，轻信谣传，使自己误入歧途。这次教育很有成效，许多群众后来不但不打听、不传播小道消息，而且听到后就报告，追根究源，深刻批判，使小道消息在群众中没有市场。
    注意抓先进，树典型，调动积极因素，这是惠阳专区革委会抓思想政治工作的第三个特点。他们认为，群众中的革命正气树立起来了，歪风邪气就没有市场了。他们在紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，落实毛主席最新指示过程中，每走一步，都注意运用典型引路。不论是促进革命大联合，革命三结合，深入持久地开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍等项工作，他们都注意树立典型，调动积极因素。在革命大批判方面，他们及时宣传了博罗县黄山洞大队的经验。和平县过去革命大批判搞不起来，学习了黄山洞的经验以后，很快就开展起来了。
    以深厚的无产阶级感情和满腔革命热忱对同志进行帮助，这是惠阳专区革委会抓思想政治工作的第四个特点。今年五月，一个革命群众组织的头头向革委会写了一封信，反映了他对无产阶级文化大革命的形势的看法有不少糊涂认识，并说惠阳地区实现革命大联合“太快了”。革委会经过研究，认为这不是一个人的问题，而是代表一部分人的思想。革委会就抓住这个思想，组织群众进行讨论，革委会成员并分头下去组织报告会、座谈会，来提高群众的认识。同时，革委会满腔热情地对写信的同志进行了帮助。专区革委会主任找这个写信的同志和有相同观点的同志举行了座谈，摆事实，讲道理，用毛主席的指示来帮助他们提高阶级觉悟，使这些同志很快地认识到自己的错误。这个写信的同志检查说：“资产阶级派性蒙蔽了我的眼睛，无产阶级党性使我的眼睛大放光明。”革委会为了帮助一个同志，不怕麻烦，以对革命的高度政治责任感，反复耐心地进行工作。有一次，革委会为了帮助两个同志同坏人划清界线，一次又一次地向他们交代政策，使这两个同志很快觉悟过来，反戈一击，检举和揭发了过去蒙蔽他们的坏头头。
    惠阳专区革委会由于突出无产阶级政治，坚持大抓狠抓活思想，率领广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，因而取得了一个又一个重大的胜利。现在全区活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正在深入发展，毛主席一系列最新指示日益深入人心，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中经受了考验，得到了锻炼，不断巩固和发展。革命带动了生产，工农业生产呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
