I am the deputy commander of the militia company in Nansu Brigade, Gujiao Commune, Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, and a member of the Communist Youth League.

To understand how our family study group was established, let me start from the beginning. Our family began to seriously read Chairman Mao's works in 1965. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we often held family democratic life meetings. In February 1967, several comrades from the People's Liberation Army came to our brigade to "support agriculture" and stayed at our home. This was great because they loved Chairman Mao the most. They read Chairman Mao's works and helped us read them too. They studied well and understood deeply, assisting us in transforming our family democratic life meetings into study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works. County and commune cadres who came to stay at our place also helped us solidify these family study sessions. When Chairman Mao issued the call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," counties, communes, and brigades all started study classes. Our family sat together and discussed this matter. We thought that if counties, communes, and brigades could hold study classes, why couldn't our family? So, we decided to start a family study class. We realized that holding a study class at home is the best way to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and build a new type of revolutionary family. It is the best battlefield for eliminating the "selfish" nest and uprooting the "selfish" roots. How did we conduct the study class and apply Chairman Mao's works?

	Shared Criticism and Self-Reflection

I got married not long ago, and my husband joined the army. At first, my in-laws treated me better than my own parents. When the team asked me to sing the song "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants United," my mother-in-law would say, "Yuexiang, go ahead! If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't sing, who will?" When the masses elected me as a cadre, my father also said, "Yuexiang, go ahead! If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't serve, who will?" After becoming a brigade cadre, a new problem arose: I had less time for household chores. Over time, my mother-in-law became impatient, thinking that marrying a daughter-in-law was the same as not marrying one.

Once, during a study session on "In Memory of Norman Bethune," when we discussed serving the people completely and thoroughly, my mother-in-law made a self-criticism. She said, "Yuexiang, you work all day and attend meetings, and your father feeds the livestock all day. I do more household chores, which is also serving the people. But recently, my mind has been filled with 'selfish' thoughts, feeling impatient because you both leave after eating and I am left alone to suffer. I thought, why not give you two catties of cotton and separate our living and cooking arrangements? I won't manage anymore." After these days of study, my mind is clear. I realize that this approach does not align with Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, I will also put 'public' interests first."

My mother-in-law's self-criticism touched my heart, and I couldn't help but say, "Mom, in the past, I did fewer household chores, and when you were impatient, I also thought, coming into your family, working during the day and either attending meetings or propagating at night, I am exhausted, and Mom still frowns and is unhappy. I thought, forget it, if I continue like this, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will only worsen. This thought is also wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of 'selflessly serving the people.' But I am not like that. When faced with a task, I first think of myself and then of others. In the future, I must not be like this. I must not only be a good cadre but also help Mom more with household chores." After this shared criticism and self-reflection between my mother-in-law and me, our relationship became even closer. Then, my younger sister also opened up her thoughts. She said, "You both have shortcomings, and so do I. I am not young anymore, but I am still like a child, resting whenever I have the chance. I should help Mom more, but I am not proactive. My enthusiasm for revolutionary work is lacking. Chairman Mao says, 'All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other.' In the future, I will truly listen to Chairman Mao's words and contribute more to the collective." My younger brother also expressed that he would not play around as much and help Mom more with chores, cutting grass for the team's livestock every day after school. My father finally said, "A few days ago, when Mom got angry, I was also a bit upset. I thought, feeding livestock is indeed a tough job, tying a person down, and if you don't put in the effort, you can't do it well. If you focus on the work, household chores will definitely be neglected. But then I thought, no, this thought is clearly about 'self' and 'private' interests. If it develops, it will be terrible! Collective matters, no matter how small, are big matters, and personal matters, no matter how big, are small matters. In the future, we must often use the 'completely' and 'thoroughly' standards to measure our thoughts and definitely follow Chairman Mao's words. Whatever Chairman Mao tells us to do, we will do it."

Our family often exposes our selfish thoughts and criticizes them. Whenever there is a selfish thought, we criticize it, and it is effective. Sometimes, the person speaking turns red and their heart beats fast. I think this is the manifestation of touching the soul. Only in this way can the criticism of selfishness be effective. Because we do this, our family members get along very well with each other.

	Studying the "Three Articles" and Serving the Collective

Our whole family almost studies the "Three Articles" every day and everywhere. Whenever public and private interests conflict, we use Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate selfishness and establish public interests, transforming our worldview.

When my father was a livestock keeper, many people felt he was very responsible for his work, so they wanted to elect him as the production team leader. We discussed this in our study sessions. My mother thought that being a team leader was a "troublesome job," with too many troubles and sometimes even offending people, so she did not agree with him being the team leader. My father, in response to my mother's thoughts, studied the "Three Articles" with her. My father said, "Everyone elects me as the team leader, which means they believe I can do things for them. It is really not appropriate to be picky in revolutionary work." My mother followed, "Thinking of this, we really should not be picky. If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold the power, who will? There is an old saying, listen to Chairman Mao's words, do whatever Chairman Mao tells us to do." After my father became the team leader, he served the collective wholeheartedly and did an excellent job.

One day, while working in the fields, I saw that a plot of crops in the team's field had turned yellow, and I wanted to apply the fertilizer from our private plot to this field. But I also thought, there is not even a handful of manure in our private plot! What should I do? I consulted Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "We must all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become greatly beneficial to the people." Through study, I decided to send all the fertilizer from our home to the team's field.

When I returned from work, I told my younger sister my thoughts, and she was surprised, saying, "Adding more fertilizer to the team's field is good, but what about our private plot?" I said, "We must not have two minds towards the collective. Sending the fertilizer to the team's field, the collective will increase production, and it is good for supporting national construction." At the same time, we studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "Communist Party members, regardless of the time and place, should not put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." My younger sister quickly understood. We took the time during meals to seek my mother's and father's opinions. That night, we sent all twelve carts of fertilizer to that field. Everyone contributed a line, and we composed a poem together: "If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, selfish thoughts will rise in your mind. If you read Chairman Mao's books every day, public interests will take root and selfish thoughts will disappear. The whole family reads Chairman Mao's books, and revolutionary thoughts will take big steps forward."

	Unity and Collective Defense

During the Cultural Revolution, a rich farmer element stirred up trouble, saying, "The big-character posters given to cadres by the masses are so many, so lively, and so refreshing!" meaning he had vented his long-held grudges. A counter-revolutionary element also gathered bad people, compiling black materials of "ten major crimes" against revolutionary cadres, brigade party branch secretary, and militia political instructor Feng Xinxi. How to deal with this class struggle? Our whole family timely studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. Chairman Mao said, "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I, together with poor and lower-middle peasants, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, strived to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and used various occasions and forms, writing big-character posters and speaking out, to fight face-to-face with class enemies, severely criticizing and exposing the tricks of class enemies.

Class enemies are very afraid of and hate the revolutionary actions of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, especially my family. They used various occasions to speak ill of me, mock me, and curse me, but they did not shake my determination to propagate the highest instructions and revolutionize to the end. Class enemies, failing in one scheme, came up with another. They used slander and defamation to secretly write black letters to my husband. Later, my husband wrote me three letters from the army, saying I had a problem with my work style and proposed a divorce. After receiving these letters, I was both angry and anxious. What should I do? At that time, I suspected that my father and mother had reported on me. But then I thought, it's impossible. In the few years since I entered their home, they have treated me better than their own daughter. After thinking it over, I was sure it was the work of bad people. Later, I told my father and mother everything about my husband writing to me, and they were very angry. The whole family sat together, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on investigation and class struggle, and our minds became clear. We realized that being opposed by class enemies is a good thing, not a bad thing. Then, I went with my father to the army to find my husband, and we discussed and analyzed the problem face-to-face. After some work, the truth came to light. It turned out that a bad element's child, under the manipulation of several "four-category elements," secretly wrote a few black letters to my husband, attempting to destroy the revolutionary family and undermine military morale. Look, how evil the hearts of class enemies are!

The problem has been "revealed," and the black hand has been identified. With the assistance of the supporting-left army stationed in the brigade, the class enemies admitted their evil deeds in front of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Through this struggle, our family further understood Chairman Mao's teachings: "Enemies will not disappear by themselves." "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." It made us understand more deeply the most important truth: loyalty to Chairman Mao is victory, following Chairman Mao is victory.

Our family's study class is just the beginning. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," and we are determined to run the family study class for a long time, to achieve new levels, and to make new contributions in the struggle for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution!

    让毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地
    山西省新绛县古交公社南苏村大队民兵连副连长  卫月香
    我是山西省新绛县古交公社南苏村大队民兵连副连长，是个共青团员。
    要知道我家的学习班是怎样办起来的？还得从头说起，我家正正经经地读毛主席的书是从一九六五年开始的。按照毛主席的教导，我们经常召开家庭民主生活会。一九六七年二月间，人民解放军几个同志来我们大队“支农”，他们就住在我家里。这下可好啦，他们最热爱毛主席。他们读毛主席的书，也帮助我们读毛主席的书。他们学得好，领会深，协助我们把家庭民主生活会改为活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。县、社干部来了差不多也都在我们院里住，又帮助我们把家庭讲用会巩固下来了。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，县、公社、大队都办起学习班来，我们一家人坐到一块专门商量了这事。认为县、社、队能办学习班，我们家庭为什么不能办！说干就干，家庭学习班就办起来了。我们体会到，家庭办学习班，是迅速落实毛主席最新指示，建立新型的革命家庭的最好形式，是剿“私”字老窝，挖“私”字黑根的最好战场。我们是怎样通过学习班，活学活用毛主席著作的呢？
       共同斗私　互相谈心
    我结婚不久，爱人就参军了。开始，公婆待我比亲爹娘还要亲。队里叫我唱“贫农、下中农一条心”的歌子，我婆婆就说：月香，去吧！咱贫下中农不唱，谁唱！群众选我当干部，我爸爸也说：月香，当吧！咱贫下中农不当，谁当！我当了大队干部以后，带来的一个新问题，就是家务事管得少了。日子长了，婆婆就有点不耐烦了，认为娶下媳妇和没娶媳妇一样。
    有一次，在学习《为人民服务》的讲用会上，学到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务时，婆婆作了自我批评。她说：“月香，你整天劳动、开会，你爸整天为队里喂牲口，家务事我多作一点，本来这也是为人民服务，可是，近来我思想上‘私’字抬了头，有点不耐烦，认为你们吃了饭嘴一抹都走了，叫我一人在家受累。我想，干脆给你二斤棉花，分居分灶，我不管啦。经过这几天学习，我心眼亮啦，这样做不符合毛泽东思想，以后也要和你们一样，
  ‘公’字当头哩。”婆婆的自我批评，打动了我的心，我情不自禁地说：“妈啊，过去我做的家务活少，在您不耐烦的时候，我也想过，进您家门来，白天劳动生产，晚上不是开会就是宣传，自己累死了，妈妈还是呶嘴变脸不喜欢，算了吧，再这样下去，婆媳关系是会越闹越糟的，这种想法也是错误的。毛主席教导我们要学习白求恩同志‘毫不利己专门利人’的精神，而我自己却不是这样，一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算，今后可不能这样啦，不光要当好干部，还要多帮助妈妈分担家务。”我们婆媳之间这样一斗私，互相谈心之后，关系就更加密切了。接着我妹妹也亮开了思想。她说：“你们有缺点，我也有不对的地方，年龄也不算小啦，还是和小娃娃一样，得空就想歇歇，按说应该帮助妈妈多干些活，但是我很不主动，为革命劳动的劲头不足。毛主席说：‘一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’今后要好好听毛主席的话，多为集体贡献自己的力量。”弟弟也表示，今后不多玩耍，要多帮助妈妈做事，每天放学回家要给队里牲口割草。爸爸最后说：“前几天你妈一发脾气，我也有点恼火，曾这样想过，喂牲口这活儿的确不好干，把人缠得死死的，不下功夫干不好，把工作抓紧点，家里的活就肯定要耽误。后来一想，不对，这个想法就是明显的‘我’字‘私’字嘛，让它发展起来真不得了呀！集体的事再小也是大事，个人的事再大也是小事。今后我们要经常用这‘完全’‘彻底’两把尺子来衡量我们的思想，一定要听毛主席的话。毛主席他老人家叫我们怎么干，我们一定怎么干。”
    我们家庭就是这样经常自己亮私心，自己斗私字。一有就斗，一斗就准。有时真说的人脸红脖子粗，内心咚咚跳，我想这就是触及灵魂的表现。只有这样，斗“私”才灵应。由于我们这样作了，所以我们全家人与人之间的关系处理得很好。
           学习“老三篇”　一心为集体
    我们全家对“老三篇”几乎天天学，处处学。每逢公与私发生矛盾时，我们就用毛泽东思想破私立公，改造世界观。
    我爸爸当饲养员的时候，不少人感到他对工作很负责任，因此，想选他当生产队长。我们在学习中议论起这个事来。我妈认为当队长是“恶水罐”，受麻烦不要说，有时还要得罪人，所以不同意他当队长。爸爸针对妈妈的思想，就和妈妈一块学习“老三篇”。爸爸说：“大家选咱当队长，总是相信咱能给大家办事，咱在革命工作上挑挑拣拣实在不应该。”妈妈接着说：“要想到这里，咱怎么也不应该挑挑拣拣。印把子咱贫下中农不掌，靠谁掌？有一条老主意，听毛主席的话，毛主席叫咱干啥，咱干啥。”爸爸当队长后，一心为集体，干得很出色。
    一天，我下地干活时，看见队里有一块庄稼发了黄，很想把家里的那点肥追施到这块地里。但是，我又想到自留地里连一把粪都没施呀！怎么办？向毛主席著作请示。毛主席说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”通过学习，我决心把家里的肥全部送到集体地里。
    下工回来，我把自己的想法告诉了妹妹，妹妹惊异地说：“多给队里投点肥倒好，可咱自留地里下啥？”我说：“对集体不能有二心，把肥料投给队里，集体增了产，好支援国家建设。”同时，和她共同学习了毛主席关于“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益”的教导。妹妹很快就想通了。我们凑吃饭时间，又征求了妈妈和爸爸的意见。当晚就把十二平车肥全部送到那块地里。大家还你一句，我一句地共同凑了一首诗：“一天不读毛主席的书，头脑里私字就抬头，天天能读毛主席的书，公字扎根私字走，全家人共读毛主席的书，思想革命化路上迈大步。”
       团结一致　共同对敌
    在文化大革命中，有一个富农分子，兴风作浪，说什么
  “群众给干部贴的大字报真多，真热闹，好痛快！”意思是泄了他多年的心头恨。有一个反革命分子也纠集坏人，整理了革命干部、大队党支部书记、民兵政治指导员冯新喜的黑材料“十大罪状”。如何对付这场阶级斗争呢？我们全家人及时学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导。毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”遵照毛主席的教导，我和贫下中农一道，积极宣传毛泽东思想，努力落实毛主席的最新指示，并利用各种场合，通过各种形式，写大字报、口头发言，和阶级敌人进行面对面的斗争，严厉批判和揭露了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。
    阶级敌人对广大贫下中农，特别是对我一家的这种革命行动怕得要死，恨得要命。他们利用各种场合，说我的坏话，讽刺我，骂我，但都没有动摇我宣传最高指示和革命到底的决心。阶级敌人一计不成，又生一计。他们用造谣、污蔑的卑鄙手段，暗地里给我爱人写黑信。后来我爱人从部队连续给我写来三封信，说我作风有问题，并提出要离婚。我收到这些信后，又气又急，怎么办？当时我怀疑是爸爸妈妈写信告了我的状。后又一想，不可能，进他家的门几年来，他们对待我超过亲生的女儿，左想右思肯定是坏人作怪。后来我就把爱人给我写信的情况，一五一十地全告诉了爸爸妈妈，他们很生气。全家人坐在一起，反复学习了毛主席有关调查研究和阶级斗争的语录，心眼里亮堂了，认识到被阶级敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。接着，我就和父亲一同到部队找我爱人，三头对面，分析研究，澄清这一问题。经过一番工作，真相大白，原来是一个坏分子子弟在几个“四类”分子的操纵下，暗地里给我爱人写过几封黑信，企图破坏革命家庭，瓦解军心，看，阶级敌人的心是多么恶毒！
    问题已经“水落石出”，黑手也已经查清，在驻队支左解放军的协助下，阶级敌人在广大贫下中农面前，乖乖地低头承认了自己的罪恶事实。经过这次斗争，使我家进一步理解了毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”使我们更加懂得了一个最最重要的真理，忠于毛主席就是胜利，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。
    我家办学习班仅仅是开始，我们要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，决心把家庭学习班长期办下去，办出新水平来，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功！
