The running dogs of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists and Indian reactionaries are secretly plotting new anti-China conspiracies.

	NEW DELHI, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist renegade clique and the Indian reactionary government recently held talks in New Delhi. This is another conspiratorial activity by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique in collusion with U.S. imperialism, using the Indian reactionaries to oppose China.

	As early as January this year, the head of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, Kosygin, visited India and agreed with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to send government delegations for talks in the future to strengthen their collusion. In July, the U.S. imperialists sent a government delegation to hold secret talks with the Indian reactionary government, and the two sides plotted a comprehensive anti-China conspiracy. Two months later, from the 11th to the 17th of this month, the Soviet-Indian talks were held. The Indian reactionary government's representative participating in the U.S.-Indian and Soviet-Indian talks was the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, Baghat. It is obvious that through these two rounds of talks with the Indian reactionaries, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have coordinated their anti-China deployments.

	The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has long been practicing social imperialism in India, colluding with U.S. imperialism to use India to oppose China, which has made the increasingly awakened Indian people very indignant. When the delegation led by the Soviet revisionist clique's Deputy Foreign Minister, Filyubin, arrived in New Delhi on the 11th, the roads from the airport to the hotel were filled with slogans such as "New colonialists, get out!" hanging from trees, lampposts, and walls.

	The collusion of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists in using India to oppose China is extremely unpopular. Therefore, this round of Soviet-Indian talks was held in a secretive manner. The Indian reactionary government strictly prohibited its officials from leaking any information about the talks to the press. On the 17th, the two sides issued a vague and empty joint statement. The Indian reactionary government spokesman later emphasized the "secret nature" of the talks and refused to disclose any specific details to the press.

	According to foreign news agencies and Indian publications, in addition to conspiring against China, the two sides also focused on discussing the issue of the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Soviet revisionists' naked fascist crime has been strongly condemned by the revolutionary people of the world, and they urgently need their lackeys to provide support. The Soviet revisionists asked the Indian reactionaries to help them further.

	According to the Indian reactionary mouthpiece, the Indian News Agency, on the 16th, the Soviet delegation assured the Indian reactionary government in the talks that the Soviet revisionists' "influence" over Pakistan would always be in India's interests at any time. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's assurance once again exposed the fact that their constant propaganda about promoting Indo-Pakistani "reconciliation" and the so-called "Tashkent spirit" are all lies.

	Whether it is the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, or the Indian reactionaries, their anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people activities will not end well. No matter how they tighten their collusion, they cannot save themselves from their doomed fate.

### 美帝的帮凶走狗加紧勾结  苏修印度反动派鬼鬼祟祟策划反华新阴谋

    美帝的帮凶走狗加紧勾结
    苏修印度反动派鬼鬼祟祟策划反华新阴谋
    新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：苏修叛徒集团和印度反动政府最近在新德里举行了一次会谈。这是苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义勾结、利用印度反动派反华的又一个阴谋活动。
    早在今年一月间，苏修叛徒集团头子柯西金就曾到印度活动，同印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地商定双方在以后再派政府代表团举行会谈，以便加强勾结。今年七月，美帝国主义派出政府代表团同印度反动政府举行了秘密会谈，双方策划了全面反华的阴谋计划。两个月后的今天，从十一日到十七日，又举行这次苏印会谈。代表印度反动政府参加美印、苏印会谈的都是印度外交国务部长巴加特。显而易见，美帝苏修通过这两次同印度反动派的会谈，协调了它们的反华部署。
    苏修叛徒集团长期以来在印度实行社会帝国主义，同美帝一起利用印度反华，使日益觉醒的印度人民十分愤慨。当苏修集团的外交部副部长费留宾率领的代表团十一日到达新德里的时候，从飞机场到旅馆的沿途的树上、电灯杆上和墙上到处挂着“新殖民主义者滚回去！”的标语牌。
    美苏勾结利用印度反华的勾当是非常不得人心的。因此，这次苏印会谈是鬼鬼祟祟地举行的。印度反动政府严禁它的官员向报界泄露任何关于会谈的情况。双方在十七日发表了一个含糊其词、空洞无物的联合声明。印度反动政府发言人事后强调这次会谈的“秘密性质”，拒绝向报界透露会谈的具体情况。
    据外国通讯社和印度报刊透露，双方在会谈中除了密谋反华以外，还着重讨论了苏修出兵侵占捷克斯洛伐克的问题。苏修的这个赤裸裸的法西斯罪行，遭到了世界革命人民的愤怒声讨，因此迫切需要它的走卒给予支持。苏修要求印度反动派进一步帮它的忙。
    据印度反动派的喉舌印度报业托辣斯十六日透露，苏修代表团在会谈中向印度反动政府保证，苏修对巴基斯坦的“影响”将在任何时候都符合印度的利益。苏修叛徒集团的这个保证，再一次揭穿了它所拚命鼓吹的什么要促使印巴“和解”，什么“塔什干精神”，统统都是骗人的鬼话。
    不论是美帝苏修还是印度反动派，它们的反华、反共、反人民的勾当都不会有好结果的。它们不管怎样加紧勾结，都挽救不了它们的灭亡的命运。
