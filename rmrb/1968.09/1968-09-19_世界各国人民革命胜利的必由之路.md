The great teacher of the Chinese proletariat, Chairman Mao, wrote the following important words six years ago today for Japanese workers:

"As long as you seriously achieve the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt."

Chairman Mao's words express deep friendship to the Japanese people who are waging an unyielding and courageous struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Ryo-ben revisionist clique.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has consistently advocated combining the theories of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, which reflect the practical struggles of the proletariat worldwide, become the invincible weapon of the Chinese people when combined with the concrete revolutionary struggles of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of the people."

Chairman Mao applied and developed Marxism-Leninism, using the most resolute and thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and the most ingenious and flexible art of struggle. In extremely complex and difficult conditions, he led the entire Party and the people of the whole country through countless storms and surmounting numerous difficulties and obstacles, defeating powerful domestic and foreign enemies, and achieving a great historical victory. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the great victory of the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, which is Mao Zedong Thought.

Using the "arrow" of Marxism-Leninism to hit the "target" of the revolution in each country, this is Chairman Mao's extremely profound summary of the Chinese revolution problem, and it is also the necessary path for the people of each country to achieve revolutionary victory.

Oppressed nations and peoples, by mastering Marxism-Leninism and closely combining it with the concrete practice of their own revolution, can achieve liberation through their own struggles.

Countries that have already established proletarian dictatorship, by mastering Marxism-Leninism and continuing to closely combine it with the concrete practice of their own revolution, can prevent the restoration of capitalism through their own struggles.

The people of countries whose power has been usurped by revisionism, by mastering Marxism-Leninism and combining it with the concrete practice of their own revolution, can overthrow the rule of revisionism and rebuild proletarian dictatorship through their own struggles.

The modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union, the Ryo-ben revisionist clique in Japan, and various kinds of scabs and traitors, fear and hate the people of all countries learning and applying Marxism-Leninism in their revolutionary struggles. They strive to obstruct and sabotage it, completely degenerating into enemies of Marxism-Leninism and becoming accomplices of imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries. The people of all countries must resolutely wage an uncompromising, principled struggle against modern revisionism to achieve the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of their own revolution and win a thorough victory in the revolutionary struggle.

Marxism-Leninism is sweeping the world with the force of a landslide and the power of thunder. The consciousness of the Japanese revolutionary people has greatly increased, and their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the reactionary Sato government, and the Ryo-ben revisionist clique, is surging. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, a powerful revolutionary storm is raging, and the proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening. We firmly believe that as long as the people of all countries combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of their own revolution, bravely fight, fear no difficulties, and press forward, the victory of the revolution is beyond doubt. Chairman Mao's wise judgment will not only become a brilliant reality in Japan but will also certainly become a brilliant reality throughout the world. (September 18)

### 世界各国人民革命胜利的必由之路

    世界各国人民革命胜利的必由之路
    我国无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，在六年前的今天，为日本工人朋友做了极为重要的题词：
    “只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    毛主席的题词，对正在同美帝、苏修、日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团进行不屈不挠英勇斗争的日本人民，表示了极为深切的友谊。
    把马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命的实践密切地联系起来，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席领导中国革命的一贯思想。
    毛主席指出：“反映了全世界无产阶级实践斗争的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，在它同中国无产阶级和广大人民群众的革命斗争的具体实践相结合的时候，就成为中国人民百战百胜的武器。”
    毛主席运用和发展了马克思列宁主义，用最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级革命精神和最巧妙、最灵活的斗争艺术，在极端复杂、极端困难的情况下，领导全党和全国人民，经历无数惊涛骇浪，冲破重重艰难险阻，打败了国内外强大敌人，取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利。中国革命的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    用马克思列宁主义之“矢”，射各国革命之“的”，这是毛主席对中国革命问题的一种极为精辟的概括，同样地是各国人民取得革命胜利的必由之路。
    被压迫民族和被压迫人民，掌握了马克思列宁主义，紧紧地把它同本国革命的具体实践相结合，就能够经过自己的斗争，得到解放。
    已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家，掌握了马克思列宁主义，继续紧紧地把它同本国革命的具体实践相结合，就能够经过自己的斗争，防止资本主义复辟。
    被修正主义篡夺了政权的国家的人民，掌握了马克思列宁主义，结合本国革命的具体实践，就能够经过自己的斗争，推翻修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级专政。
    苏联现代修正主义集团、日本宫本修正主义集团以及形形色色的工贼叛徒，对各国人民在革命斗争中学习和运用马克思列宁主义，怕得要死，恨得要命，竭力加以阻挠和破坏，完全堕落成了马克思列宁主义的敌人，堕落成了帝国主义和各国反动派的帮凶。各国人民要实现马克思列宁主义同本国革命具体实践的结合，赢得革命斗争的彻底胜利，就必须坚决地同现代修正主义进行毫不调和的原则性斗争。
    马克思列宁主义正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界。日本革命人民的觉悟有了很大提高，反对美帝国主义及其走狗佐藤反动政府、宫本修正主义集团的斗争不断高涨。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，也掀起了强大的革命风暴，欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。我们坚信，各国人民只要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国革命的具体实践相结合，英勇战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。毛主席的英明论断，不但在日本，而且必将在全世界，变成光辉的现实。（九月十八日）
