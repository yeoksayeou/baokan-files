Qinghai Exceeds Annual Salt Production Target

The production volume has increased by 32 percent compared to last year. The task of transporting salt to sister provinces and regions has also been exceeded.

According to Xinhua News Agency, September 22, the revolutionary workers on the salt production front in Qinghai Province have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieved double victories in revolution and production. At present, the province has exceeded the annual production target, and the salt produced has increased by 32 percent compared to last year's total production. The task of transporting salt to sister provinces and regions has also been exceeded.

Qinghai is one of the important salt-producing areas in China, with extremely rich salt reserves. In the past, under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the socialist labor enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers could not be fully unleashed. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers raised the revolutionary banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," seized back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, criticized their reactionary revisionist black goods such as "profit-first" and "material incentives," and smashed some old frameworks that shackled the workers' hands and feet. The revolutionary committees at all levels earnestly implemented the policy of reducing bureaucracy and simplifying administration, reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, and transferred office workers. The leading members of the revolutionary committees at all levels went deep into the production front line, worked side by side with the workers, studied Chairman Mao's works together, criticized and repudiated private thoughts and revisionism, and continuously improved their leadership style. The broad revolutionary workers' revolutionary spirit was greatly promoted, which in turn promoted the development of technological innovation. Some salt production bases have poor equipment and high labor intensity. Revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, made machines by themselves, modified machines, improved transportation methods, and greatly increased labor productivity.

    青海超额完成全年盐业生产任务
    产量比去年全年增长了百分之三十二。调运兄弟省区的任务也已超额完成
    据新华社西宁二十二日电　青海省盐业战线的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，切实贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。目前，全省已经超额完成全年的生产任务，生产的盐比去年全年产量增长了百分之三十二。调运兄弟省区的任务也已经超额完成。
    青海是我国重要产盐地之一，盐类的蕴藏量极其丰富。过去，在党内一小撮走资派的把持下，广大革命职工的社会主义劳动热情得不到充分发挥。无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命职工高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派窃据的大权，清算了他们推行的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，摧毁了某些束缚工人手足的旧框框。各级革命委员会认真实行精兵简政，改革不合理的规章制度，下放科室人员。各级革委会的领导成员深入生产第一线，与工人并肩劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，不断改进领导作风。广大革命职工革命精神大发扬，促进了技术革新的开展，有的盐业生产基地设备较差，劳动强度较大，革命职工遵照毛主席关于敢于斗争，敢于胜利的教导，自己动手制造机械，改装机器，改进运输方法，大大提高了劳动生产率。
