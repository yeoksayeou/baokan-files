Chairman Mao's Latest Directive

Students from old-style schools, the majority or a great majority of them, can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the leadership of the correct line, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    毛主席最新指示　
    从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。
