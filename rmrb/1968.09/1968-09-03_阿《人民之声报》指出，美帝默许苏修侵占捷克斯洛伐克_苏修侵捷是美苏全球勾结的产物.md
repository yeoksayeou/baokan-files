The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on the 28th stating that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's savage invasion of Czechoslovakia is a product of the global counter-revolutionary strategy of U.S.-Soviet collaboration.

The article said that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has long placed the strengthening of comprehensive political, military, economic, and cultural cooperation with the imperialists at the forefront of its policies. Recently, through a series of new U.S.-Soviet agreements based on the purposes of enslaving the peoples of various countries, suppressing revolutionary and liberation struggles, and dividing spheres of influence in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, this cooperation is being strengthened.

The article said that in fact, the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia was done with the tacit approval of U.S. imperialism. Although the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine has engaged in deceptive propaganda to mislead the public, the U.S. leaders have once again openly admitted that their main concern is to further strengthen cooperation with the Moscow leadership. Three days after the Soviet revisionists occupied Czechoslovakia, the White House spokesman declared that there was a plan for a high-level meeting between Johnson and the Soviet revisionist leaders to begin talks between the two countries on so-called arms limitation and "getting out of the Vietnam quagmire." There is no doubt that the U.S. imperialists' agreement to the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia is a reward for the Soviet revisionist clique's sabotage of the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle. Johnson is very interested in pushing the counter-revolutionary collaboration with the Kremlin forward. He wants to use the tacit approval of the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia as a bargaining chip to gain further support from the Soviet revisionists in his plot to achieve "peace talks," suppress the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle, and make the freedom-loving people of Vietnam submit to the new American colonialists.

The article said that the facts increasingly educate the people that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, in order to realize the hegemonic policy of dividing spheres of influence between the two superpowers, is always ready to sacrifice the freedom of the people of any country. The Soviet revisionist leadership has become the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Just as in the case of Czechoslovakia, the brutal trampling and violation of a small country by a large country is another good lesson for those who still harbor illusions about the Soviet revisionists and their ally, U.S. imperialism.

The article concluded by saying that freedom cannot be begged for, cannot be obtained through secret deals within the walls of the Kremlin, and cannot be obtained through the promises of the occupiers and their allies. Only through resolute struggle, unyielding and unwavering opposition to the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys, to imperialism, to domestic revisionism and reactionaries, can freedom be won. The people of Czechoslovakia, in this just struggle, will now and in the future receive the support of all revolutionary forces and all progressive and freedom-loving peoples in the world.

    阿《人民之声报》指出，美帝默许苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克
    苏修侵捷是美苏全球勾结的产物
    苏修为了同美帝划分势力范围，大力推行霸权政策，成为美帝头号帮凶
    新华社地拉那三十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十八日发表编辑部文章指出，苏修叛徒集团野蛮地出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克是美苏合作反革命全球战略的产物。
    文章说，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团很久以来就把加强同帝国主义者的政治、军事、经济和文化的全面合作放在自己政策的首位。最近，通过以美苏两大国奴役各国人民、镇压革命和解放斗争、划分在欧、亚、中近东的势力范围等目的为基础的一系列新的美苏协议，使这种合作正在加强。
    文章说，事实上，苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略是经过美帝默许的。尽管美帝宣传机器为了掩人耳目，进行了蛊惑人心的宣传，美帝头子再次公开承认，他们关心的主要问题是进一步加强同莫斯科领导人的合作。在苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克三天以后，白宫发言人宣称，存在着约翰逊同苏修领导人高级会晤的方案，以便开始两国有关所谓限制军备和“走出越南的死胡同”的会谈。毫无疑问，美帝同意苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的侵占，是对苏修集团破坏越南人民解放斗争的酬劳。约翰逊对于把同克里姆林宫的反革命合作不断推向前进，颇感兴趣。他想以默许苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克作为交换条件，争取在实现其“和谈”、镇压越南人民解放斗争、使爱好自由的越南人民屈从于美国新殖民主义者的阴谋中，得到苏修的进一步帮助。
    文章说，事实愈来愈教育人民，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团为了实现美苏两大国划分势力范围的霸权政策，时刻准备牺牲任何国家人民的自由。苏修领导已变成了美帝的头号帮凶。正象捷克斯洛伐克事件一样，一个大国粗暴地践踏和蹂躏一个小国，这一事实对那些对苏修及其同盟者美帝还存在幻想的人，是又一个很好的教训。
    文章最后说，自由不能乞求，不能靠在克里姆林宫围墙内作秘密交易取得，也不能靠占领者及其同盟者的许诺取得。只有通过坚决斗争，毫不妥协地、始终不渝地反对苏修及其仆从，反对帝国主义，反对国内修正主义和反动派，才能赢得自由。捷克斯洛伐克人民在这一正义斗争中，现在和将来都将得到世界上一切革命力量、所有进步和爱好自由人民的支持。
