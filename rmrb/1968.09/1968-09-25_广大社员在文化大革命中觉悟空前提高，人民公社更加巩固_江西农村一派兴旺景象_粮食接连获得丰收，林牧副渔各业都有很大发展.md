The broad masses of commune members in Jiangxi have raised their awareness to an unprecedented level during the Cultural Revolution, and the people's communes have been further consolidated. The rural areas of Jiangxi present a prosperous scene. Grain harvests have been consecutively bountiful, and the forestry, livestock, sideline, and fisheries industries have all seen significant development.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 24th: After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members in Jiangxi's rural areas has been raised to an unprecedented level. The collective economy is thriving, the people's communes are more consolidated, and a prosperous scene is presented everywhere.

Now, in the rural areas of Jiangxi, people's spiritual outlook has undergone extremely profound changes. The broad masses of commune members have never been as enthusiastic and spirited as they are now. They are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production. One victory after another is being reported from all directions. Based on last year's bumper harvest, this year's spring and summer grains have also been bountiful. The Gan South mountainous region, which has long been known as a "barren land," has suddenly leaped into the forefront, with early and mid-season rice and other summer grains increasing by 10% to more than 20% in all communes. The Gan East region along the banks of Lake Poyang, known as the "land of fish and rice," although it was hit by several floods this year, still achieved a bumper harvest of hundreds of thousands of acres of early and mid-season rice. In the joyous days of harvest, the commune members, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically deliver grain to the state. So far, the new grain stored in the province has increased by more than one and a half times compared to the same period last year. The speed of grain delivery to the state and the quality of the grain are unprecedented. Now, the late rice in various places is also a scene of bumper harvests, and the forestry, livestock, sideline, and fisheries industries have all seen significant development. A new leap-forward situation has begun to appear throughout the province.

"Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The good situation in the rural areas of Jiangxi is the result of the various levels of leadership of the people's communes in various places relying closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, uniting the broad revolutionary masses, and firmly grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The broad masses of commune members have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism of the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. They have launched relentless attacks on a handful of class enemies.

At present, many people's communes throughout the province have established mass dictatorship teams composed of poor and lower-middle peasants to exercise dictatorship over a handful of class enemies in order to further consolidate the socialist position in the countryside.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution." After the establishment of the various levels of leadership of the people's communes in various places in Jiangxi Province, they led the broad masses of commune members to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, and launched an unprecedented scale of the movement to learn from Dazhai in agriculture. In this mass movement, various places paid attention to setting up local models. The Yichun District set up the 500-Li Production Team as a model, the Ganzhou District set up the Jiaoxi Brigade as a model, and the Shangrao District set up the Xintian Commune as a model. In this way, the commune members have a clear direction to learn from and a nearby model to follow, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members.

The members of the various levels of leadership of the people's communes throughout the province, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on "organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses," have conscientiously gone among the masses, taking the task of leading the broad masses of commune members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their fundamental task. All commune and brigade cadres have gone among the masses and universally implemented the "three brings": bringing down Chairman Mao's instructions, bringing class struggle consciousness, and bringing work arrangements; bringing up the results of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, bringing the experience of the masses' struggle, and bringing the opinions and demands of the masses. They have lived among the poor and lower-middle peasants for a long time, eating, living, working, studying, and fighting together with them, regardless of day or night, wind or rain. Where there is a task, they go there; where class struggle is the sharpest, they appear there. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise: We are genuinely fond of such cadres. They are our trusted and leading figures!

    广大社员在文化大革命中觉悟空前提高，人民公社更加巩固
    江西农村一派兴旺景象
    粮食接连获得丰收，林牧副渔各业都有很大发展
    据新华社南昌二十四日电　经过两年多来无产阶级文化大革命，江西广大农村人民公社社员社会主义觉悟空前提高，集体经济蓬勃发展，人民公社更加巩固，处处展现出一派欣欣向荣的大好形势。
    现在，在江西农村，人的精神面貌发生了极其深刻的变化。广大社员从来没有象现在这样斗志昂扬，意气风发，他们狠抓革命，猛促生产，一个接一个的捷报，从四面八方不断传来。各地在去年丰收的基础上，今年春粮和夏粮又获得丰收。一向被称为
  “瘠薄之地”的赣南山区，今年一跃而进入先进行列，各个公社早、中稻等夏粮普遍增产一成到两成以上。号称“鱼米之乡”的赣东北鄱阳湖滨地区，今年虽然遭到几次洪水的袭击，仍然得到了数百万亩早、中稻的丰收。在喜庆丰收的日子里，社员们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，以极大的热情，踊跃向国家交售粮食。到目前为止，全省入库新粮比去年同期增长一倍半多，向国家送粮进度之快，粮食质量之好，都是空前未有的。现在，各地晚稻又是一片丰收景象，林、牧、副、渔各业都有很大发展，一个新的跃进局面已经开始在全省出现。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”江西农村大好形势的出现，是各地人民公社的各级领导机构紧紧依靠贫下中农，团结广大革命群众，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的结果。广大社员高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，展开了深入持久的革命大批判，不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。
    目前，全省各地许多人民公社为了进一步巩固农村社会主义阵地，已经纷纷建立起由贫下中农组成的群众专政队伍，对一小撮阶级敌人实行专政。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”江西省各地人民公社的各级领导机构建立后，领导广大社员深入开展革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的一套反革命修正主义黑货，开展了空前规模的农业学大寨的群众运动。在这个群众运动中，各地注意树立本地的样板。宜春专区树立了五百里生产队的样板，赣州专区树立了焦溪大队的样板，上饶专区树立了新田公社的样板，这样社员们学习起来远有方向，近有样板，进一步调动了社员们的积极性。
    全省人民公社各级领导机构的成员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，扎扎实实地深入于群众之中，把带领广大社员活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，作为自己最根本的任务。所有社、队干部深入群众，普遍实行了“三带”：即下去带毛主席指示，带阶级斗争观念，带工作布置；上来带落实毛主席指示的成果，带群众斗争的经验，带群众的意见和要求。他们长期生活在贫下中农当中，与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，不分日夜，不管风雨，那里有任务就到那里去，那里阶级斗争最尖锐就出现在那里。贫下中农赞扬说：我们打心眼里喜欢这样的干部，这才是我们的贴心人，带头人！
