Women workers from the construction front across Albania held a meeting

NEW YORK, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) — According to recent reports from newspapers here, representatives of women workers from the construction front across Albania held a national meeting in Tirana on August 31. The meeting reviewed the great strength and contributions of women and young women in building a socialist motherland and reported to the Albanian Labor Party their outstanding achievements in production labor.

V. Kabo, chairman of the Albanian Women's Union, and Dragoti, minister of construction, attended the meeting. Hanku, deputy minister of construction, said at the meeting that in recent years, the number of women workers in the construction teams has increased significantly, and many women workers have already become skilled construction workers. This shows that the old ideas of despising and belittling women's participation in construction labor are being eliminated by women themselves, by life itself, and by the development of the revolution.

Many female carpenters, masons, electricians, and machine operators attending the meeting reported on how they followed the teachings of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, broke away from old ideas and old concepts, overcame various difficulties, and worked selflessly with male workers to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party and achieved outstanding results.

    向劳动党汇报生产出色成绩
    阿建筑战线女职工举行会见
    新华社地拉那电　据这里的报纸最近报道，来自阿尔巴尼亚全国各地建筑战线上的女职工代表，八月三十一日在地拉那举行全国性会见，检阅妇女和女青年在建设社会主义祖国中的巨大力量和贡献，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党汇报她们在生产劳动中的出色成绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚妇女联合会主席维·卡博、建筑部长德拉戈蒂等出席了会见。建筑部副部长汉库在会上说，最近几年来，建筑队伍中的女职工人数有了显著的增加，并且不少女职工已经成为熟练的建筑工人。这表明，轻视和贬低妇女参加建筑业劳动的旧观念，正在被妇女自己、被生活本身和革命的发展所破除。
    出席会见的许多女木工、泥水工、电工和机械工在会上介绍了她们遵循阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的教导，破除旧思想和旧观念，克服种种困难，同男工人一起为完成党所赋予的光荣任务而忘我劳动和取得的出色成绩。
