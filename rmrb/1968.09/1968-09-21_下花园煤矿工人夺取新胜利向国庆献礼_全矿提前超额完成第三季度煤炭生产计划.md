The workers of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province, with the support and assistance of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, have fully played the leading and vanguard role of the working class. They have focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production, making both revolution and production thrive. They have achieved a new victory by completing the third quarter coal production plan 17 days ahead of schedule, dedicating this achievement to the National Day.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that "the working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work must be fully brought into play," the broad revolutionary workers of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine were greatly inspired. They immediately selected outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, under the unified leadership of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and entered schools and other units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation had not been well carried out. At the same time, the mine's revolutionary committee, workers' congress, and various workshops and teams held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive. The entire mine quickly launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Under the leadership of the mine's revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary workers of this mine, with revolution leading production, focused on revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, effectively promoting the development of production. The surface main shaft of the No. 1 pit was once declared by reactionary bourgeois technical "authorities" to have a maximum lifting capacity of no more than 900 tons. The workers in this pit area severely criticized the fallacies of the bourgeois technical "authorities" and, in their labor, displayed boundless enthusiasm and a spirit of great communist cooperation, ensuring that the vehicles were fully linked in their turnover. They finally achieved a daily lifting capacity of 1,450 tons. Since entering September, the production of the No. 3 pit has been seriously affected due to changes in natural conditions. The revolutionary workers of the No. 1 and No. 2 pits proposed the slogan of "making up for losses by surpassing," taking on the coal production tasks of three pits, and ensuring that the entire mine completed the third quarter production plan ahead of schedule and in excess of the target.

    下花园煤矿工人夺取新胜利向国庆献礼
    全矿提前超额完成第三季度煤炭生产计划
    新华社石家庄十九日电　河北省下花园煤矿广大工人，在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用和主力军作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把革命和生产搞得热气腾腾，以提前十七天完成了第三季度煤炭生产计划的新胜利，向国庆献礼。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示发表后，极大地鼓舞了下花园煤矿广大革命职工，他们立即挑选优秀工人，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在张家口市革命委员会的统一领导下，开进学校和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。与此同时，矿革委会、工代会和各车间、班组普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，全矿迅速掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    这个矿的广大革命职工在矿革委会的领导下，以革命统帅生产，狠抓革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，有力地推动了生产的发展。一井区的地面主井，反动的资产阶级技术“权威”们曾断言：提升能力最高超不过九百吨。这个工区的工人群众狠批了资产阶级技术“权威”的谰言，在劳动中发扬了冲天干劲和共产主义大协作精神，使车辆周转充分衔接，终于创造了日提升一千四百五十吨的成绩。进入九月份以来，三井区因自然情况变化，生产受到严重影响。一井二井的革命职工提出了“以超补亏”的口号，两个井担负起了三个井的产煤任务，保证了全矿提前超额完成第三季度生产计划。
