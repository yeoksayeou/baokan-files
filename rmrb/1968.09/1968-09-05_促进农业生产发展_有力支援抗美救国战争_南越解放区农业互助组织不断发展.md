In the vast liberated areas of South Vietnam, mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups have seen widespread development in recent years, thereby promoting agricultural production and more strongly supporting the anti-American national salvation war.

By the end of last year, agricultural mutual aid organizations had spread throughout the various liberated areas of South Vietnam. After the South Vietnamese military and people launched a victorious offensive this spring, not only were the old mutual aid teams further consolidated and expanded, but many new mutual aid teams were also established in various places. Currently, in the central region where mutual aid organizations have developed relatively well, there are tens of thousands of mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups; in the southern region, there are also thousands of mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups. In the Mekong Delta region, known as the "rice bowl" of South Vietnam, more than a thousand mutual aid teams have been established since the beginning of this year.

The rapidly developing mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups have effectively promoted the development of agricultural production in the liberated areas. In many regions, farmers, by organizing themselves, have united and assisted each other, rationally allocated manpower, and reasonably used agricultural tools and draft animals. As a result, they have been able to expand the area of cultivated land and summer crops, build more water conservancy facilities, engage in deep plowing and fine cultivation, and ensure increased grain production.

In some areas that have suffered severe enemy destruction, farmers, relying on mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups, have effectively resisted the enemy's destruction of agricultural production. In the liberated areas of Ben Tre Province, due to enemy bombing and the use of chemical poisons, more than 4,800 hectares of land were left barren, and individual farmers were unable to restore production. However, after organizing themselves this year, farmers, relying on collective strength, quickly planted crops on these barren lands within a short period. In the liberated areas of Long An Province, after organizing mutual aid teams, farmers not only cultivated their original lands and dug many irrigation canals but also allocated manpower to fill in hundreds of bomb craters, enabling more than 50 hectares of land to be restored for production. In some areas, due to enemy arson and looting, some households lacked labor, agricultural tools, or draft animals, making it difficult for individual households to engage in production. However, after the establishment of mutual aid organizations, farmers helped each other and shared resources, overcoming difficulties and developing production.

Due to the development of mutual aid organizations, farmers in various regions of the South who have achieved bumper harvests actively pay their war taxes to the National Liberation Front to support the anti-American national salvation war. Many farmers have paid war taxes exceeding the prescribed amount by several times or more. At the same time, after the establishment of mutual aid organizations, labor has been rationally utilized, enabling the vast rural areas of the liberated areas to allocate more manpower to join the liberation armed forces and support the frontline troops. In the first half of this year alone, tens of thousands of young people in the liberated areas of the central and southern regions have enlisted in the army.

### 促进农业生产发展  有力支援抗美救国战争  南越解放区农业互助组织不断发展

    促进农业生产发展  有力支援抗美救国战争
    南越解放区农业互助组织不断发展
    据新华社河内电  在越南南方广大解放区，近年来变工组和互助组有了普遍的发展，从而促进了农业生产，更有力地支援抗美救国战争。
    到去年年底为止，农业互助组织已经遍及越南南方各个解放区。越南南方军民在今年新春发起胜利攻势之后，不仅使老的互助组更加巩固和扩大了，而且各地成立了许多新的互助组。目前，发展互助组织较好的中部地区，已有上万个互助组和变工组；南部地区，也有数千个互助组和变工组。在号称南越粮仓的湄公河三角洲地区，今年开始以来，在几个月中就成立了一千多个互助组。
    日益发展的互助组和变工组，有力地促进解放区农业生产的发展。许多地区，由于农民们组织起来，他们团结互助，合理调配人力，合理使用农具和畜力，因而能够扩大耕地面积和夏种面积，兴修更多的水利设施，进行深耕细作，保证粮食增产。
    在有些遭受敌人破坏较严重的地区，农民们依靠互助组和变工组，有力地抵御了敌人对农业生产的破坏。在建丰省解放区，由于敌人的轰炸和施放化学毒药，有四千八百多公顷土地荒芜了，个体农民无力恢复生产。但今年农民们组织起来之后，依靠集体的力量，在很短的时间内就在这些已经荒芜的土地上种了作物。槟椥省楳棋县的农民，在组织了互助组后，不但耕种了原有的土地，修挖了很多水渠，而且还抽出人力，填平了成百个炸弹坑，使五十多公顷土地得以恢复生产。有的地区，由于敌人的烧杀和抢掠，使有些农户缺少劳动力、农具或耕畜，单家独户很难进行生产。但在互助组织成立起来后，农民们互相帮助，互通有无，困难克服了，生产也发展了。
    由于互助组织的发展，获得丰收的南方各地农民，积极向民族解放阵线交纳抗战公粮，支援抗美救国战争。不少农民缴纳公粮的数字，超过规定数字的几成或一倍以上。与此同时，由于成立互助组织后合理使用了劳动力，使解放区广大农村能够抽出更多的人力参加解放武装和支前民工队，直接上前线抗击美伪军。仅在中部中区和南部中区的解放区，今年上半年就分别有数万名青年报名参军。
