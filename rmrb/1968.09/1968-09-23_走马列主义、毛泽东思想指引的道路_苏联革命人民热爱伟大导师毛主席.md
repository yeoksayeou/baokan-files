Under the brutal rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, despite all persecution, express their boundless love for the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, through various means. They strive to study the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and firmly declare that they will, under the guidance of the great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, carry out a second revolution, thoroughly overthrow the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist clique in the Soviet Union, and rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Soviet revisionist clique, despite mobilizing all its propaganda machines, frenziedly attacks the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, and shamelessly defames the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. However, lies cannot cover the truth, and dark clouds cannot obscure the sun. More and more Soviet people are increasingly seeing through the true face of the Soviet revisionist clique and are more reverent and loving towards the great leader Chairman Mao. Not long ago, a Soviet engineer and technician wrote in Russian on a piece of paper during a conversation with a Chinese comrade, "The Soviet people love our dear Chairman Mao very much." A Soviet soldier wrote in a letter to the great leader Chairman Mao, "I, as an officer nurtured by Stalin, am writing to you. I love you very much, and no one can eliminate this feeling of love for you." The letter further stated, "I live in Russia, but I support the revolutionary cause led by you because it is correct." When handing the letter to a Chinese comrade, he enthusiastically said, "I miss Comrade Mao Zedong very much. He is the great leader of the people of the whole world. I wish Comrade Mao Zedong eternal vigor and longevity!"

The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union regard obtaining a Chairman Mao badge as the greatest happiness and the greatest honor. Whenever they receive a Chairman Mao badge, their hearts are filled with great emotion. A Soviet female worker, when asking a Chinese comrade for a Chairman Mao badge, said, "If I can get a Chairman Mao badge, I can see Chairman Mao every day and fight by Chairman Mao's side every day!" When this worker's wish was fulfilled, she was extremely excited and said, "Thank you for bringing us the red sun in our hearts! Our family's hope has been realized." Not long ago, in Sverdlovsk, Soviet Union, a young Soviet person obtained a beloved Chairman Mao badge from a Chinese comrade. After other young people learned of this, more than twenty young people immediately came to ask for Chairman Mao badges. Despite the surveillance and interference of Soviet secret police, they kept shouting, "We love Mao Zedong!" Once, a Soviet citizen obtained a Chairman Mao badge from a Chinese comrade. Initially, he was very excited and wore the Chairman Mao badge on his chest. After a while, fearing that the Soviet secret police would discover it, he respectfully wore the Chairman Mao badge on the inside of his shirt, close to his heart. He meaningfully told the Chinese comrade, "The persecution by Soviet revisionists has made my heart closer to Chairman Mao!"

The broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union, who have personally experienced the suffering of the restoration of capitalism by the Soviet revisionists, have come to recognize through the victorious progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China that Chairman Mao is the greatest teacher and the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, and that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Once, a young Soviet worker showed a Chinese comrade the carefully preserved photographs of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" he had, and pointed to the photographs of Chairman Mao and the revolutionary book, saying, "After studying the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I completely believe in the correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and I do not believe in the lies of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique." A Soviet peasant said, "Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism. I have Chairman Mao's works at home, and I often study them." In Moscow, a Soviet worker told a Chinese comrade, "'Quotations from Chairman Mao' has many words that I have memorized," and "I have read some of Chairman Mao's words to the workers in our factory, and they all expressed support."

Many revolutionary masses in the Soviet Union not only study Chairman Mao's works themselves but also organize their family members to study together. A Soviet worker said that for several years, he has been persistently studying Chairman Mao's works. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, he often listens to and records the latest instructions from Chairman Mao on Beijing Radio and then organizes the whole family to study. He said, "Our whole family will open a Mao Zedong Thought study class. We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and walk the path guided by Chairman Mao."

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Soviet people are deeply engaged in the struggle against the Soviet revisionist clique. A Soviet worker confidently told a Chinese comrade:

"Chairman Mao's words are the words in the hearts of the Soviet people. The fascist dictatorship established by Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin in the Soviet Union will definitely be smashed." Three Soviet Georgian workers told a Chinese comrade, "The Soviet people will definitely carry the Soviet revolution to the end according to the path guided by Chairman Mao!" The Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will surely break through all obstacles and thoroughly bury the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique.

    走马列主义、毛泽东思想指引的道路
    ——苏联革命人民热爱伟大导师毛主席
    在苏修叛徒集团残暴统治下的苏联革命人民，不顾一切迫害，通过各种方式，表达对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱，努力学习战无不胜的毛泽东思想，并且坚定地表示，一定要在伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，进行第二次革命，彻底推翻苏修叛徒集团在苏联的黑暗统治，重建无产阶级专政。
    苏修叛徒集团尽管开动全部宣传机器，疯狂攻击世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席，无耻诽谤光辉的毛泽东思想，但是，谎言掩盖不了真理，乌云遮挡不住太阳。越来越多的苏联人民，日益看清了苏修叛徒集团的真面目，对伟大领袖毛主席更加崇敬，更加热爱。不久以前，一位苏联工程技术人员，同中国同志交谈时，在纸上用俄文亲切地写道，“苏联人民非常热爱我们的亲人毛主席。”一位苏联军人在写给伟大领袖毛主席的信中说，“我作为斯大林培育起来的一名军官给您写信。我非常热爱您，任何人也不能消除我热爱您的这种感情。”信中又说，“我生活在俄罗斯，但我拥护您所领导的革命事业，因为它是正确的”。他在把信交给一位中国同志时热情地说：“我非常想念毛泽东同志，他是全世界人民的伟大领袖。祝毛泽东同志永远精力充沛，万寿无疆！”
    苏联革命人民把得到一枚毛主席像章当作最大的幸福和最大的光荣。每当他们得到毛主席像章的时候，心情都是非常激动。一位苏联女工向中国同志索取毛主席像章时说，“如果我能得到一枚毛主席像章，就能天天看到毛主席，天天在毛主席身边战斗！”当这位女工的愿望得到满足后，她异常激动地说，“谢谢你们给我们送来了心中的红太阳！我们全家的希望实现了。”不久以前，在苏联斯维尔德洛夫斯克，一位苏联青年向中国同志要到了一枚心爱的毛主席像章，这件事被其他青年知道以后，马上又来了二十多个青年索取毛主席像章。他们不顾苏修特务的盯梢和干涉，不断地高声说：“我们热爱毛泽东！”有一次，一位苏联公民向中国同志要到一枚毛主席像章，起先他非常兴奋地把毛主席像章佩戴在胸前，过了一会儿他怕被苏修特务发现，又恭恭敬敬地把毛主席像章佩戴在内衣的贴心处。他意味深长地对中国同志说，苏联修正主义者的迫害使“我的心离毛主席越来越近了！”
    亲身经受着苏修复辟资本主义的苦难的苏联广大劳动人民，通过中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展，更加认识到毛主席是当代无产阶级最伟大的导师和最杰出的领袖，毛泽东思想是反对帝修反的最强大的思想武器。有一次，一位苏联青年工人请中国同志观看他精心保存的毛主席照片和《毛主席语录》，他指着毛主席照片和革命宝书对中国同志说，“我学习了毛主席语录以后完全相信毛主席革命路线的英明正确，我不相信苏联修正主义领导集团的谎言”。一位苏联农民说，“毛主席天才地、创造性地发展了马克思主义。我家中有毛主席的著作，我经常学习。”在莫斯科，一位苏联工人对中国同志说，“《毛主席语录》中的许多话，我都牢牢记住”，“我把毛主席的一些话给我们工厂的工人读了，他们都表示拥护。”
    苏联许多革命群众不仅自己学习毛主席著作，还组织自己的家庭成员一起学习。一位苏联工人说，几年来他一直坚持学习毛主席著作。中国文化大革命以来，他经常收听北京电台广播并记录毛主席的最新指示，然后组织全家学习。他说，“我们全家要开办毛泽东思想学习班，我们永远听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的路。”
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏联人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，正在深入地开展反对苏修叛徒集团的斗争。一位苏联工人满怀信心地向中国同志表示：
  “毛主席说的话就是苏联人民心里的话。赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金在苏联建立的法西斯专政，一定会被砸烂。”三位苏联格鲁吉亚工人对中国同志说：“苏联人民一定要按照毛主席指引的道路将苏联革命进行到底！”具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民，必将冲破一切障碍，彻底埋葬苏修叛徒集团的反动统治。
