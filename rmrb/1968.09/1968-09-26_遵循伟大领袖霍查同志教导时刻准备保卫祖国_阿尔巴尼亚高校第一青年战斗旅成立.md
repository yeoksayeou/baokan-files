Albanian universities held a grand ceremony on September 22 to establish the first youth combat brigade. The brigade is composed of students from all higher education institutions in Tirana, who are ready to defend the socialist motherland while continuing their studies. In the morning of September 22, thousands of Albanian male and female university students, dressed in dark green military uniforms and holding guns, marched to the square in front of Tirana University, singing revolutionary songs such as "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, the Other Holding a Gun." They participated in the establishment ceremony of the first youth combat brigade with high morale and vigor.

A large portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, was hung on the main building of Tirana University. A banner with the words of Comrade Hoxha, "Defending the motherland is a great and glorious task," was hung in front of the podium.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Muftiu, Alija, and candidate member Kellezi, as well as candidate member and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, Dum, and other party, government, military, and mass organization leaders, and representatives of workers, factories, and schools from the Albanian capital attended the ceremony.

In his speech, Ili, the president of Tirana University, said that under the guidance of the Party and Comrade Hoxha, Albanian university students will bravely overcome all difficulties and obstacles and march forward forever. They will master science and technology and be ready to join the regular army at any time to go to any front line needed by the motherland. At the meeting, Chako, the director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, delivered a speech on behalf of the army. Dum, the Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, presented the military flag to the first youth combat brigade.

After receiving the military flag, Jekovi, the secretary of the Tirana University Committee of the Albanian Labour Youth League, said on behalf of all the university students that they would strive to master science and technology and combat skills and be ready to defend the fruits of the revolution from the invasion of imperialists, modern revisionists, and other reactionaries at any time.

The first secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labour Youth League, Mero, also spoke at the meeting.

After the meeting passed a telegram of respect to the Central Committee, the entire brigade of the first youth combat brigade, in the majestic military music, marched in neat rows and passed the podium, accepting the inspection of the party, government, and military leaders.
