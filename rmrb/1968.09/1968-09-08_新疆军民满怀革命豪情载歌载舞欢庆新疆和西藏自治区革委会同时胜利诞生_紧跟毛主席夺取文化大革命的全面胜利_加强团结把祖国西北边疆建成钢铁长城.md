The eight million heroic sons and daughters of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, who are fighting on the frontline against revisionism, imperialism, and the reactionary Indian forces, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joy, enthusiastically celebrating the fact that, except for Taiwan Province, the entire country is red. They enthusiastically celebrate the simultaneous birth of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and the Tibet Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. The revolutionary people of the thirteen ethnic groups in the autonomous region unanimously expressed in the celebration activities: We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must fully play the leading role of the working class, launch a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The simultaneous birth of the revolutionary committees of Xinjiang and Tibet is a great joy for the entire country to achieve a red landscape, which greatly encourages the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In recent days, more than a million people across the autonomous region have participated in celebration rallies and parades. People of all ethnic groups sang and danced, enthusiastically shouting:

	"Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"
	"Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"
	"Long live, long live, long live Chairman Mao!"

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang, the fifty million industrial workers, who played a leading role, repeatedly studied the editorial "Long Live the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" from People's Daily and PLA Daily during the celebration activities. The revolutionary workers of Xinjiang 81 Steel Plant recalled the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and said, "At this moment of national jubilation, we steel workers are extremely excited. We deeply understand that every victory we have achieved is personally guided by the great leader Chairman Mao. We vow: We must redouble our efforts to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, warmly support, fully assist, actively help, and resolutely defend the newly born revolutionary committees, and advance under the command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy."

The joyous news reached the vast oases and grasslands, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and poor herdsmen spread the word, overjoyed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Kashi Suburb Seman Commune, with the most sincere proletarian feelings for the great leader of all ethnic groups, repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Twelve years ago, Chairman Mao added a note to the article "Local and Village Cadres Have the Ability to Lead the Establishment of Cooperatives," which reflected the socialist high tide in the countryside here, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of Uyghur farmers to take the cooperative path. On this great day, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this commune wrote Chairman Mao's note from that time in Uyghur and Han scripts on bright red paper, framed it in a large frame, and carried it to the celebration rally to express their determination to follow Chairman Mao to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the celebration rallies held in various places, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups emphasized that Xinjiang is located on the frontline of the country, facing the most intense and complex class struggle against revisionism, imperialism, and the reactionary Indian forces. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen national unity and military-civilian unity, and build the northwestern frontier of the motherland into an iron wall, ready at any time to smash the provocations and invasions of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and guard the western gate of the motherland.

On the 7th, the capital of the autonomous region, Urumqi, was once again immersed in a festive atmosphere. More than ten thousand military and civilian personnel held a grand rally and parade, enthusiastically celebrating the red landscape of the entire country. Comrade Long Shujin, Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration rally, calling on the revolutionary people of the entire region to further carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 7th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, with boundless proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the joy of victory, together with the eight million people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, sang and danced, enthusiastically celebrating the simultaneous birth of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and the Tibet Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, enthusiastically celebrating that our great motherland, except for Taiwan Province, has achieved a red landscape across the country. The heroic officers and soldiers and the broad masses of production and construction soldiers who made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution solemnly declared that they must, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation; they must be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen preparedness, strengthen the border defense, and be ready at any time to decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate all daring enemies.

The joyous news of the simultaneous birth of the revolutionary committees of Xinjiang and Tibet reached the camps of various units in the Tian Shan Mountains and the long border defense outposts, where everywhere was decorated with lanterns and drums, presenting a grand festive scene. Many units such as the Xinjiang Military Region, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335th Unit held grand celebration rallies. The officers and soldiers gathered around the carefully embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao, danced the "loyalty" dance to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao, and performed programs praising the "revolutionary committees are good." The shouts of "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" echoed through the military camps, outposts, and the vast borderlands.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, who are fighting on the frontline of "three supports and two militaries," were particularly excited on this joyous day as they reviewed the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang. They said, "Every step of Xinjiang's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was personally guided by Chairman Mao, and every victory was a triumph of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must continue to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and give our all to fight the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and create new merits for the people." The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region, composed of ten ethnic groups including Uyghur, Kazakh, Xibe, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Mongol, and Hui, angrily denounced the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Xinjiang, Wu Guang, Lü Jianren, Zhang Zhonghan, Yiminuofu, and Baoguo, a small group of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and reactionary local nationalists, who attempted to restore capitalism and split the unity of the motherland. Everyone firmly declared that they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause," cherish the unity of the country and all ethnic groups like their own eyes, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees with their lives and blood.

The joyous news reached the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the broad masses of production and construction soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao immediately held grand celebration rallies and parades. The broad masses of production and construction soldiers expressed that they must seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and build the corps into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. They said, "We, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, are an armed production force. We must carry forward the fine tradition of being both a production team and a combat team and a work team, closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups, firmly defend, cherish, and support the newly born revolutionary committees, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, be vigilant against and smash all sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies, consolidate the border defense, and defend the great socialist motherland." The broad masses of officers and soldiers guarding the Ili, Tacheng, Altay, and Kizilsu regions solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your border guards will forever be loyal to you! Our positions are all on the frontline against revisionism. We must build the border defense of the motherland into an iron wall. If the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries dare to invade, we will make sure they come back empty-handed!"

On September 5th, Urumqi, Xinjiang, was filled with a festive atmosphere. Twenty thousand revolutionary people of all ethnic groups and officers and soldiers of the PLA sang and danced, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and enthusiastically welcoming the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.
