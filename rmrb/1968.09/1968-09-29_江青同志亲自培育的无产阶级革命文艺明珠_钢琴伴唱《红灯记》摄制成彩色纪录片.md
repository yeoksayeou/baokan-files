A revolutionary cultural gem nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing, the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern," has been filmed as a color documentary by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and will soon be screened nationwide to meet with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally watched and listened to the performance of the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern" soon after its birth. Now, this vibrant flower of proletarian revolutionary culture, the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern," will bloom across the country through the film, making the revolutionary culture full of vitality exert an even broader and deeper influence in serving proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing, this proletarian revolutionary cultural treasure—the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern"—has, since its birth three months ago, been deeply loved and enthusiastically praised by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people for its "unity of politics and art, content and form, revolutionary political content, and as perfect artistic form as possible." It has been praised for its "fresh and lively style, a Chinese flavor and Chinese style that the Chinese people love to hear and see." From cities to rural areas, from mountain outposts to coastal fishing ports, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers gather around their radios, listening over and over again to this new form of proletarian revolutionary culture that praises contemporary heroes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and is filled with the spirit of proletarian revolution. Many revolutionary masses have enthusiastically written letters and articles to newspapers, sharing their education and inspiration from listening to the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern," and eagerly hoping to see this brilliant artistic gem. In response to the demands of the masses, cultural workers have decided to film the piano accompaniment version of "The Red Lantern."

This color film documents eight exquisite arias performed by Yin Chengzong, Qian Haoliang, and Liu Changyu from "The Red Lantern."
