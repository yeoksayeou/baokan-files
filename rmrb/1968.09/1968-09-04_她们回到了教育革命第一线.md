Work team member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the capital, Wu Shugeng, came to Class 6511 of Beijing Industrial University. He heard that there were seven female students in the class who rarely participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. What was the reason for this? Wu Shugeng, as a veteran teacher, conducted further investigation and research. It turned out that these students thought that the school revolutionary committee had been established, and everything was calm, so they had nothing to do at school and went out instead.

Wu Shugeng immediately tried to bring them back and help them solve their ideological problems. He followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "conducting heart-to-heart talks, which is a very good method" to do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. He studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions with them and introduced the thrilling class struggle situation in the school to them. He also used the method of recalling past hardships and sweet memories to arouse their class consciousness. He said: "Comrades, I have never been to school and have never studied for a single day. At the age of thirteen, I followed my father to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord, enduring all kinds of hardships. Countless revolutionary predecessors shed their blood and sacrificed their lives to build this country for us. Today's good days are truly hard-won! You all come from working-class families. If it were in the old society, could you go to university? Today, if we do not thoroughly carry out the educational revolution, our country will change color!"

Wu Shugeng's words deeply moved the hearts of the seven students. He continued affectionately: "Workers build houses for you to live in, and peasants provide you with food to eat. With such good conditions, if you do not seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, can you repay the working people? Can you repay Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao says you are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, and his hopes are placed on you. You must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations!"

The seven students were deeply moved by the old worker's words, feeling extremely warm and excited. The leader of the class leadership group, Qiu Shuxian, could not help but shed tears, saying to Wu Shugeng: "Teacher Wu, you have given us a vivid class education lesson. From now on, we promise to come to school every day and actively participate in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, to be good students of Chairman Mao!"

Indeed, the seven students returned to the frontline of the educational revolution and actively participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. They wrote big-character posters with the whole class, organized criticism meetings, and often worked until late at night. Now, the whole class presents a lively revolutionary scene.

    她们回到了教育革命第一线
    首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员吴书庚，来到北京工业大学六五一一班。他听说班里有七个女同学，很少参加学校的斗、批、改。这是什么原因呢？吴书庚老师傅作了进一步调查研究。原来，这些同学认为校革委会已经成立，风平浪静，在学校里没事干，就到外面去跑。
    吴书庚马上设法把她们找回来，帮助她们解决思想问题。他遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，做深入细致的思想政治工作，和她们共同学习毛主席一系列最新指示，又给她们介绍学校里惊心动魄的阶级斗争情况。他还通过忆苦思甜，启发她们的阶级觉悟。他说：“同学们，我没进过学校门，没念过一天书。我在十三岁时，就跟父亲一起给地主当长工，吃尽人间苦。无数革命前辈流血牺牲，为我们打下了江山。今天的好日子真是来之不易啊！你们都出身于劳动人民家庭，要是在旧社会，你们哪能上大学？今天，我们要是不把教育革命搞彻底，我们的国家就会改变颜色啊！”吴书庚的话，深深地打动了这七个同学的心。他继续亲切地说：“工人给你们盖楼住，农民给你们粮食吃。有这么好的条件，你们不认真搞好斗、批、改，能对得起劳动人民吗？能对得起毛主席他老人家吗？毛主席说你们好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳，希望寄托在你们身上。你们可不能辜负毛主席他老人家的期望啊！”
    七个同学听完老工人一席话，心中感到无比温暖，非常激动。班领导小组负责人邱淑娴同学，不禁热泪盈眶，对吴书庚说：“吴师傅，你给我们上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。从今以后，我们保证每天到校，积极参加学校的斗、批、改，做毛主席的好学生！”
    果然，这七个同学回到了教育革命第一线，积极参加学校的斗、批、改。她们和全班同学一起写大字报，组织批判会，常常忙到深夜。现在，全班呈现出一派生气勃勃的革命景象。
