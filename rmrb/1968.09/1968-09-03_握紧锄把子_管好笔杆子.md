The editorial article "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End in the Field of Journalism" from the editorial departments of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* Magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* conveys the wise instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao on journalism work. After studying it, we poor and lower-middle peasants feel particularly pleased. Chairman Mao's instructions and the article by the two newspapers and one magazine are a devastating blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and they are a battle order to launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the field of journalism.

For many years, as we in Dazhai interacted with journalists, we had a lot to say but nowhere to say it. In the past, the leadership of the news industry was in the hands of a small clique of capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies. We had things to say but nowhere to say them, and even if we did say them, no one listened. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has blown up the independent kingdom of the news industry, and the great proletarian class is about to enter it. Now, regarding the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev, we in Dazhai want to expose, denounce, and criticize it!

Dazhai is a red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai are all revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The path of Dazhai is the self-reliant revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. Every achievement of Dazhai is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We see clearly: whether or not to acknowledge the achievements of Dazhai, whether or not to publicize the experiences of Dazhai, whether or not to defend the red flag of Dazhai—this is a concrete reflection of the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the field of journalism.

In 1964, Chairman Mao issued the call: "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture." This is an important part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and is a major issue concerning which path China's agricultural construction should take. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Shanxi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's great call. They fear Dazhai, hate Dazhai, and see Dazhai as a thorn in their side, trying every means to chop down this red flag.

A small clique of capitalist roaders in the news industry specially listened to the Chinese Khrushchev's lies and created various kinds of counter-revolutionary public opinion to chop down the red flag of Dazhai.

Didn't the Chinese Khrushchev say to his agent in the news industry: "You don't need to be afraid to reflect on the dark side of things," "If the policy is wrong, just say it's wrong, as long as there is material to support it." The small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the news industry, with their hearts set on serving their master, want to say that the policy of "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" is "wrong." For this, they did many bad things in Dazhai. They acted arrogantly, and as soon as they arrived in Dazhai, they didn't know whether it was cold or hot, and they saw everything as chaotic. They did not publicize the achievements and experiences of Dazhai but instead implemented a blockade; they lied and said that Dazhai was worthless. We in Dazhai produced a lot of grain, actively sold it to the state, and ourselves lived frugally. What's wrong with that? But these people sneaked into the dining hall, peeking and prowling, and said, "The labor intensity in Dazhai is high, and the living conditions are bad." We actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, struggle hard, and have no idle time all year round. The men and women of the commune work with blood on their hands, turning poor Dazhai into rich Dazhai. But they refused to acknowledge it, saying, "Dazhai people just bend over to repair the land and cannot summarize the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works; there's nothing to report." Tens of thousands of people responded to Chairman Mao's call and came to Dazhai to visit and learn. They were afraid that the experience of Dazhai would spread, so they said, "The experience of Dazhai has no universal significance and cannot be learned in the plains." We in Dazhai emphasize proletarian politics and implemented the labor management system of "working for the public good and reporting labor points honestly." They also didn't like it, saying, "This is not socialism; it's like grabbing at clouds, and it cannot be published." Even more despicable, an agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Shanxi news industry, who had never come to Dazhai before, came to "report" on Dazhai after Chairman Mao issued the call to "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture." Who knew that he secretly compiled a pile of black materials and sent them to the Chinese Khrushchev. These bad guys said that the red flagpole of Dazhai had worms and wanted to chop down the red flag. Let me tell you, the worms are not us; they are you! You have black hearts and blind eyes, following the Chinese Khrushchev, and you are the real pests!

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the news industry did not publicize Dazhai but instead promoted a false model in Shanxi and publicized it extensively. Another agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Shanxi news industry personally went there to fabricate a batch of large articles, spreading rumors and poison, blowing it up to the skies. They are using a false red flag to suppress our true red flag and opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. What are they boosting the morale of? Whose prestige are they undermining? Isn't this openly creating public opinion for the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev!

We are not afraid. We have implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and have not implemented the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We honestly do the revolution, and our achievements and experiences are all there, with not a bit of falseness. Chairman Mao supports us, and Mao Zedong Thought guides us. We believe: the red will not turn black, and the black will not turn red; the true will not turn false, and the false will not turn true. Whoever wants to say that Chairman Mao's policy of "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" is "wrong" will not succeed! We poor and lower-middle peasants will not agree! To those journalists who specially work for the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, our attitude in Dazhai is clear: resist, resist firmly! As a result, the red flag of Dazhai did not move at all but was held higher and higher. They wanted to knock us down, but in the end, we knocked them down! If we could be knocked down by them, we would not be worthy of being the Dazhai that holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao said: Before the classes are eliminated, newspapers, magazines, radio, and news agencies all have class characteristics and serve a certain class. This is absolutely true. In the past, the leadership of the news front was in the hands of capitalist roaders, and they used this front to create counter-revolutionary public opinion and serve the restoration of capitalism in China. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, things have been turned upside down, and the news front has been seized back by the proletariat. This is a great victory. Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The news industry is specifically in charge of creating public opinion, so the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have been competing for this important front. This matter is too important, and we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot ignore it. In the future, we must hold tight to the hoe handle and also manage the pen. If we only hold the hoe handle and do not manage the pen, we cannot publicize Mao Zedong Thought, cannot implement dictatorship over the enemy in the ideological realm, and cannot hold the reins of the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao also taught us: The fundamental issue of running a newspaper well is the issue of the thought revolutionization of the newspaper staff. This is absolutely right. Over the years, the cadres, commune members, and reporters, editors, photographers, and painters of Dazhai have had a lot of interaction. Whether their thoughts are revolutionized and to what extent they are revolutionized, we in Dazhai see it quite clearly. Most of the reporters who came to Dazhai are good and want to make a revolution, and they have also achieved some results. But to be honest, we also saw that among the various people who came to work in Dazhai, the ones who had the most conflicts with the people of Dazhai and had the most problems were the reporters. Why is this? It is because their thoughts are not revolutionized; they have been poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

In our opinion, the first problem is the thought of fame and profit. The Chinese Khrushchev shouted: "Let reporters have fame and profit." "Let reporters become famous," and if they have no fame and profit, it will "suppress the enthusiasm of the reporters." Some reporters are troubled by this bourgeois "self," and their minds are full of thoughts of fame and profit. They come to Dazhai not to publicize Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line but to make a name for themselves, write big articles, become famous, and gain profits. They take a photo, draw a picture, and write an article, as if all the merits are theirs, and they put the merits of the working people in their own account. If this bad thought is not eliminated, can the reporters serve the people? No, they can only serve "fame" and serve "profit." If "fame and profit" cloud their eyes, they may consciously or unconsciously serve the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, which is very dangerous.

Another problem is the wrong position. Some reporters, as soon as they arrive, put on a stinky attitude, as the Chinese Khrushchev said, they have "special duties" and are "special people," and they are not to be trifled with. They are not serving the people but letting the people serve them. They think: I come to publicize and report for you, write big articles, and take big photos. You have to listen to me and serve me. How many people I want to talk to, you have to come with that many, and when I want to talk, you have to talk at that time. This is completely the attitude of a bourgeois lord. Reporters with this kind of thought look down on the working people very much and think highly of themselves, always wanting the working people to respect them. If you receive them well, I will write a good article, a big article for you, turning no achievements into achievements and small achievements into big achievements. If you receive them poorly, even if there are achievements, they won't write about them for you. Even if they do write, they will say a few good words on the surface but will grumble and be very dissatisfied behind their backs.

Chairman Mao taught us: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." He also said: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." We farm, and you write articles; we are all serving the people and working for a common revolutionary goal. No one can be higher than the other. It is all revolutionary work, so we should care for each other, help each other, and cooperate with each other. We cannot put ourselves above the masses but should put ourselves among the masses and be on equal terms with the masses.

Another problem is the issue of class feelings. Some reporters come to Dazhai and always feel out of place with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Why? Because they do not have the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They do not ask about production, do not participate in labor, do not care about the lives of the masses, and only care about writing articles. In this way, their thoughts are not the same as those of the poor and lower-middle peasants, their words are not the same, and their actions are not the same. For example, when it is dry, we say it is good to have rain, but the photographers say it is bad; when it is flooded, we fear the rain, but the photographers, in order to take photos after the rain, hope for rain. The commune members think about farming for the revolution, increasing production, contributing more, and supporting the state, but some reporters think about writing big articles, becoming famous, and gaining profits. If the thoughts are not correct, how can there be class feelings of the working people? Without the class feelings of the working people, can good articles reflecting the working people be written? Can good photos praising the working people be taken? Definitely not. Some reporters complain that the masses do not approach them and do not like them. Why don't you first put down your attitude and take a mirror to look at your own face? Because you have alienated yourself from the masses, do not serve the masses, and have lost the trust of the masses, the masses do not like you, do not approach you, and even oppose you, which is quite natural.

Some people say that what I mentioned above are work methods and work styles. This view is incorrect. We think it is a matter of stance, attitude, and worldview. Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." This fundamental transformation, in one sentence, is to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Journalists are people who educate others, and to educate others, they must first revolutionize their thoughts and have a great revolution in their souls to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. If this command is not carried out, the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev will still revive through "selfishness," and the great power of the proletarian revolutionaries that has been seized will be lost. Grass must be uprooted. After criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the poisonous weeds of revisionism have been uprooted, and the root of "selfishness" has been dug out, then a revolutionary journalist can be made. It should be seen that after the test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary comrades in the news industry have been educated, and their thoughts and styles have also changed. We are both happy and have great hopes. Because the class struggle has not ended, the class enemies who have been overthrown are still alive and want to counterattack. Editors and reporters have walked the old road for a long time and have not yet gotten used to walking the new road. These all indicate that we still have important tasks ahead, and we must continue the revolution and carry forward a fighting spirit to complete this task.

What should we fight against?

Against the revisionist journalistic line. Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution." Proletarian revolutionaries must hold power well, and first of all, they must carry out thorough criticism and revolution. We must criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev. It is not enough for journalists to criticize in their rooms; we poor and lower-middle peasants must cooperate with the proletarian class to enter the doors of the news agencies and help them carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. Journalists must also go out of the agencies and come to the masses to struggle together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this way, with internal and external attacks, we can criticize the revisionist journalistic line thoroughly and make it have nowhere to hide. Criticism must be based on local materials, that is, to combine the revisionist journalistic line of the Chinese Khrushchev with the local poison and criticize it. Only in this way can we criticize more and more deeply.

Against the worldview of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao taught us: "The working people must be intellectualized, and intellectuals must be laborized." Intellectuals must realize thought revolutionization, and first of all, they must be laborized. Even those who hold pens must also hold hammers and hoes, go to factories and villages, put down their attitudes, participate in labor, change their thoughts, and honestly learn from the working people to thoroughly change their worldview. Clothes must be stained with mud, faces must be tanned, and hands must be blistered. Only in this way can they strengthen their class feelings with the working people and temper a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. With proletarian feelings and personal experience in practice, they can write articles that the working people like.

Against the old habits. The old habits are still very strong in the minds of some reporters. For example, they do not investigate or study but wander around, turn their pens, and write an article; they do not work hard or seriously but like to flatter and pull strings; they look down on "rough people" and think they are clever, but they often cannot distinguish between enemies and friends or right and wrong; they like to do things according to the old framework and cannot see new things, etc. If these old habits are not thoroughly fought against, they will walk back to the old road. Journalists whose thoughts are truly revolutionized can change these bad habits.

We welcome reporters, welcome those who truly serve Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, welcome those who truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and welcome those whose thoughts are revolutionized. We do not welcome those who serve the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, nor do we welcome those who are two-faced and backstabbers. We hope that after a great revolution in the news industry, a large number of reporters who think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, are anxious about what the poor and lower-middle peasants are anxious about, love what the poor and lower-middle peasants love, and hate what the poor and lower-middle peasants hate, and who truly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants will grow up. In this way, the great power of the proletarian news industry will be firmly held in the hands of the true proletarian revolutionaries. Then, we broad poor and lower-middle peasants will be at ease.

    握紧锄把子  管好笔杆子
    ——肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义新闻路线的流毒
    陈永贵
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部重要文章《把新闻战线的大革命进行到底》，传达了伟大领袖毛主席对新闻工作的英明指示，我们贫下中农学习以后，心里感到特别痛快。毛主席的指示和两报一刊的文章，是对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义新闻路线的毁灭性打击，是掀起新闻战线斗、批、改高潮的战斗动员令。
    多少年来，我们大寨人在和新闻记者打交道的过程中，心里积了好多话，很想对新闻界说一说。可是，在过去，新闻事业的领导权把持在一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务手里，我们有话没处说，说了也没人听。无产阶级文化大革命，炸开了新闻界的独立王国，伟大的工人阶级要开进去了。现在，对于中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义新闻路线，我们大寨人要揭发，要控诉，要批判！
    大寨是毛主席他老人家亲自树起来的一面红旗。大寨的贫下中农，个个是毛泽东思想武装的革命战士。大寨的道路，是毛主席指引的自力更生的革命道路。大寨的每一个成绩，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们看得清清楚楚：承认不承认大寨的成绩，宣传不宣传大寨的经验，保卫不保卫大寨的红旗，这是新闻战线两个阶级、两条路线斗争的一个具体反映。
    一九六四年，毛主席他老人家发出号召：“农业学大寨”。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要组成部分，是关系到我国农业建设走什么道路的大问题。中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，疯狂地对抗毛主席的伟大号召。他们怕大寨，恨大寨，把大寨看成眼中钉、肉中刺，千方百计要砍倒大寨这面红旗。
    新闻界的一小撮走资派，专门听中国赫鲁晓夫的鬼话，为砍倒大寨这面红旗制造各种各样的反革命舆论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不是对他在新闻界的代理人说过吗：“你们不要怕反映黑暗的东西”，“如果政策错了，就说错了，有材料作根据”。新闻界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一心为他们的主子效劳，要把“农业学大寨”的政策说成是“错了”的。为这个，他们在大寨干了许许多多坏事。他们狐假虎威，一到大寨，也不知是凉啦，还是热啦，把一切都看得乌烟瘴气。他们对大寨的成绩和经验不宣传，实行封锁；昧着良心，把大寨说得一无是处，一钱不值。我们大寨人生产了很多粮食，积极交售给国家，自己省吃俭用，这有什么错？可是，这帮家伙溜到饭场，探头探脑，鬼鬼祟祟，看这家饭稠啦，那家饭稀啦，就胡说什么：“大寨劳动强度大，生活不好。”我们活学活用毛泽东思想，艰苦奋斗，整年没有农闲时间，男女社员干活手上挂血，把个穷大寨变成了富大寨。可是，他们硬是不承认，说什么：“大寨人就是弯腰修地，总结不出学习毛主席著作的经验，没啥可报道的。”成千上万的人响应毛主席的号召，到大寨来参观，来取经。他们唯恐大寨的经验传播出去，就瞎说：“大寨的经验没有普遍意义，平原地区不能学。”我们大寨人突出无产阶级政治，实行了“一心为公劳动，自报公议工分”的劳动管理制度，他们也看不顺眼，胡说什么：“这是不要社会主义，是神仙一把抓，不能见报。”更可恶的是，中国赫鲁晓夫在山西新闻界的一个代理人，过去从来不到大寨，偏偏在毛主席发出“农业学大寨”的号召以后，他大摇大摆地跑到大寨“采访”来了。谁知道，他暗地里整理了一大迭子黑材料，送到中国赫鲁晓夫手里。这些坏家伙，硬说大寨红旗杆杆上生了虫虫，要把红旗砍倒。告诉你们吧，虫虫不是我们，是你们！你们黑了心，瞎了眼，跟着中国赫鲁晓夫跑，你们才是不折不扣的害人虫！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在新闻界的代理人，他们不宣传大寨，反而在山西另树了一个假典型，大肆宣传。中国赫鲁晓夫在山西新闻界的另一个代理人亲自出马，到那里炮制了成批的大块文章，造谣、放毒，吹得满天飞。他们这是拿假红旗压我们真红旗，对抗毛主席的革命路线。他们这样干，长了谁的志气？灭了谁的威风？他们这不是明目张胆地为中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命阴谋造舆论吗！
    我们不怕。我们执行了毛主席的革命路线，没执行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线。我们老老实实干革命，成绩和经验都摆在那里，没掺半点假。毛主席他老人家给我们撑腰，毛泽东思想给我们指路，我们相信：红的黑不了，黑的红不了；真的假不了，假的真不了。谁想把毛主席“农业学大寨”的政策说成“错”的，办不到！我们贫下中农不答应！对那些专门为中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线干事的记者，我们大寨人的态度很明确：顶，硬着头皮顶！结果，大寨的红旗纹丝没动，越举越高。他们想打倒我们，到头来我们把他们打倒啦！要是我们能被他们打倒，那还称得起什么高举毛泽东思想红旗的大寨！
    毛主席说：在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。这话千真万确。过去，新闻阵地的领导权把持在走资派手里，他们就利用这个阵地制造反革命舆论，为在中国复辟资本主义服务。经过无产阶级文化大革命，事情翻了个个儿，新闻阵地由无产阶级夺回来了，这是一个大胜利。毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”新闻事业是专管造舆论的，所以无产阶级和资产阶级一直在争夺这个重要阵地。这个事太重要了，我们贫下中农不能不过问。往后，我们手里要握紧锄把子，也要管理笔杆子。要是光拿锄把子，不管笔杆子，就不能宣传毛泽东思想，就不能在思想领域中对敌人实行专政，无产阶级的印把子就保不住。
    伟大领袖毛主席还教导我们说：办好报纸的根本问题是报社人员的思想革命化问题。真是对极了。这些年来，我们大寨的干部、社员和记者、编辑、照像的、画画的打交道很多。他们的思想是不是革命化了，革命化的程度到底怎么样，我们大寨人看得比较清楚。到大寨来的记者大多数同志是好的，是要革命的，也做出了一定的成绩。可是说心里话，我们也看到来大寨工作的各方面的人，和大寨人合不来，矛盾闹得大、问题出得多的要数记者这一行。这是为什么呢？就是思想没有革命化，就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义新闻路线的毒。
    照我们看，第一条是名利思想。中国赫鲁晓夫就嚷嚷过：“要让记者有名有利”。“让记者出名”，没名没利，就“压制了记者的积极性”。有些记者，就是这个资产阶级“私”字作怪，装了满脑子的名利思想。他们到大寨来，不是为了宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的革命路线，他们来是想捞一把，想写大块文章，出大名，得大利。他们照了个像片，画了个画，写了篇文章，好象功劳全是他们的，把劳动人民的功劳记在他们的账上。这个坏思想不去掉，记者能为人民服务吗？不能。只能为“名”服务，为“利”服务。要是让“名利”糊住了眼睛，他就可能自觉不自觉地为资产阶级反动路线服务，这是很危险的。
    再有一条叫作位置摆得不对。有些记者，一来就摆出一副臭架子，象中国赫鲁晓夫说的，他们有“特殊职务”，是些“专门的人”，不得了。他们不是为人民服务，而是让人民为他们服务。他们认为：我来给你宣传报道，写大文章，拍大镜头，你要听我的，为我服务，我要多少人谈话，你就得来多少，我要啥时谈，就得啥时谈。这完全是资产阶级老爷态度。有这种思想的记者，他们把劳动人民看得很低很低，把自己看得很高很高，总想让劳动人民尊敬他。你接待的好，我就给你写篇好文章、大文章，没成绩写成有成绩，小成绩写成大成绩。你接待的不好，有成绩也不给你写，就是写了，表面上说了几句好话，背地里也是嘟嘟囔囔，很不满意。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”又说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。我们种田，你们写文章，都是为人民服务，为了一个共同的革命目标工作的，谁也不能高谁一等。都是革命工作，就要互相关心，互相帮助，互相配合。不能把自己摆在群众的头上，要摆在群众之中，和群众平起平坐。
    还有一条，就是阶级感情问题。有些记者到大寨，总觉得和贫下中农格格不入。为什么？就因为他没有贫下中农的阶级感情。一不问生产，二不参加劳动，三不关心群众生活，光是为了写文章。这样，他们就和贫下中农想的不一样，说的不一气，做的不一劲。比如天旱了，我们说下雨好得很，照像的说下雨糟；天涝了，我们怕下雨，照像的为了拍雨后镜头，盼下雨。社员们想的是为革命种田、多增产、多贡献、多支援国家，有些记者想的是写大块文章，出大名，得大利。思想不对头，怎么能有劳动人民的阶级感情呢？没有劳动人民的阶级感情，能写出反映劳动人民的好文章吗？能拍出歌颂劳动人民的好照片吗？肯定不能。有些记者嫌群众不接近他，不喜欢他，为啥自己不首先放下架子，拿起镜子照照自己的脸呢？因为你脱离了群众，不为群众服务，失去了群众的信任，群众不喜欢你，不接近你，甚至反对你，这是理所当然的。
    我讲的这几条，有人说是工作方法问题，工作作风问题。这种说法不对。我们认为，是立场问题，是态度问题，是世界观的问题。毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。这个根本的转变，归到一句话，就是破私立公。记者是教育人的人，要教育别人，自己先要思想革命化，要在灵魂里来一个破私立公的大革命。不革这个命，中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义新闻路线的流毒，还会借“私”还魂，无产阶级革命派夺到手里的新闻大权还会丢掉。斩草要除根。批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义新闻路线，修正主义的毒草铲除了，又挖掉了“私”字的根，那就能做一个革命的新闻工作者。应当看到，经过无产阶级文化大革命的考验，新闻界的广大革命同志受到了教育，他们的思想作风也起变化了。我们是又高兴，又有很多希望。因为阶级斗争并没有结束，被打倒的阶级敌人，人还在心不死，还想反扑。编辑、记者在旧道上走惯了，开始走新路还感到不习惯，这些都说明，我们面前还有重要的任务，要继续革命，继续发扬一种斗的精神，才能完成这个任务。
    同什么斗呢？
    同修正主义的新闻路线斗。毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”无产阶级革命派要掌好权，首先就要把革命大批判进行到底。要把中国赫鲁晓夫那一套反革命修正主义新闻路线批倒批臭，光靠新闻工作者钻在房子里批判是不行的，我们贫下中农要配合工人阶级走进新闻机关的大门，帮助他们搞好斗、批、改。新闻工作者也要走出机关，到群众中来，和工农兵一块批。这样，内外夹攻，才能把修正主义新闻路线批得臭臭的，叫它无处藏身。批判，要就地取材，就是把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义新闻路线和在本地的流毒结合起来批，这样才能越批越恨，越批越透。
    同资产阶级的世界观斗。毛主席教导我们说：“劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”知识分子要实现思想革命化，首先要劳动化。就是拿笔杆子的人，也要拿起锤把子、锄把子，进工厂、到农村，放下架子，参加劳动，改造思想，老老实实向劳动人民学习，彻底改造世界观。衣服要沾泥，脸要晒黑，手要磨泡，这样才能够增强同劳动人民的阶级感情，才能够炼出一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。有了无产阶级的感情，又在实践中有了亲身的体会，就能写出劳动人民喜欢的好文章。
    同旧的习惯势力斗。旧的习惯势力，在一些记者的头脑里，还是很大的。比方说，不调查、不研究，东蹓蹓，西逛逛，笔头一转，就写一篇；工作不艰苦，不认真，喜欢吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯；瞧不起“大老粗”，自以为高明，可是又常常分不清敌我，分不出是非；喜欢按老框子办事，看不见新鲜事物，等等。如果不彻底斗掉这些旧习惯势力，走着走着，就又会走到老路上去了。思想真正革命化的记者，这些毛病都是可以改掉的。
    我们是欢迎记者的，欢迎真正为毛主席革命路线服务的记者，欢迎真正为工农兵服务的记者，欢迎思想革命化了的记者，而不欢迎为中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线服务的记者，不欢迎口是心非、两面三刀、当面说好话背后捣鬼的记者。我们非常希望，在新闻界进行一场大革命以后，有一大批想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，爱贫下中农所爱，恨贫下中农所恨，真正为贫下中农服务的人民记者成长起来，把无产阶级的新闻大权牢牢掌握在真正的无产阶级革命派手里。这样，我们广大贫下中农就放心了。
