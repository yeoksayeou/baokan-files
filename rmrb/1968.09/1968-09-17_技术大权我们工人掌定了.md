In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the midst of the high tide of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, we are overjoyed to read the important editorial note published in the September 5 issue of the *Red Flag* magazine. The policies proposed in this editorial note are the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, expressing our innermost thoughts, greatly boosting the morale of the working class and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. We fully endorse and resolutely implement them.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and in all work must be fully brought into play." Chairman Mao has the utmost confidence in us workers and provides us with the strongest support. The working class must firmly grasp the leadership of the factory, including technological power, and never disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations.

The Chinese Khrushchev, this great traitor and scoundrel, standing on the side of the landlord bourgeoisie, falsely claims that "one should not think that relying on the working class will solve all problems," and that one should "especially rely on the factory directors, engineers, and technicians." In reality, he wants to rely on the capitalist-roaders and the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." This is utterly reactionary!

Under the domination of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line, a small clique of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technological "authorities" in our factory monopolized our political power. They used the technological power they had usurped to suppress us workers in every possible way, setting up countless barriers for our technological innovations. To carry out technological innovations, we had to go through layers of approval procedures from the workshop to the department and the factory's various offices, passing through twenty-eight checkpoints before we could conduct innovation trials. If we violated these rules, our trial tools would be confiscated as "black tools." This completely deprived us workers of our rights to technological innovation and invention. They also maliciously slandered, saying, "Workers are stupid and can only wield pickaxes. Technology? That's the domain of 'experts' and 'authorities'."

Chairman Mao says: "The most intelligent and most capable are the soldiers with the most practical experience." The facts are exactly this way.

In our factory's machining workshop, the body cavity of the machine bed was a weak link. In 1959, the capitalist-roaders in the factory implemented the revisionist line of "experts running the factory" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, ignoring us workers and finding a few technicians without practical experience to solve this problem. Under the guidance of the idea of seeking the big and the foreign, they spent tens of millions of yuan to design and manufacture an "automatically controlled" large-scale special-purpose combination machine tool. Because it was detached from production reality and merely copied from foreign designs, after manufacturing, it had serious problems with precision, axis distance, surface finish, automatic control, and even the tool holder could not be inserted, making it impossible to put into production. We workers watched this with our eyes and were anxious in our hearts, proposing many rationalization suggestions. But the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technological "authorities" who held the power ignored our suggestions and organized a few "foreign devils" to "break through the bottleneck." However, these "foreign devils" were also useless, staring blankly at the machine tool, helpless. In the end, it was all for nothing, making this machine tool a piece of junk, lying idle for nine years, seriously affecting production.

We workers could not tolerate such criminal acts of wasting state property and decided to take matters into our own hands to improve and repair the machine. However, the bourgeois "authorities" were not willing to admit defeat and jumped out to provoke, saying, "Don't touch it, whoever breaks it will be responsible!" We workers did not buy their talk and continued to work. When we started, they poured cold water, saying, "It's useless, this machine tool is only good for scrapping." They also used their authority to create numerous obstacles in terms of manpower, materials, and tools. For example, to grind a tool, which could normally be done in ten minutes, they delayed it for over a month. When reforming a fixture, a bourgeois "authority" even said, "Change the fixture? If you can change it, I'll give you my head." Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid and cannot be defeated. We followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "resolving to overcome a thousand hardships and ten thousand obstacles to strive for victory," pooling our strengths, breaking through numerous difficulties, and in less than half a year, successfully changed the fixture.

The great proletarian cultural revolution swept away the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and the set of "expert-run factory," "slave mentality," and "crawling philosophy" he peddled were all swept into the dustbin of history by our workers' iron brooms.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," we seized the leadership of the factory, including technological power, from a small clique of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technological "authorities," truly becoming the masters of the factory. We responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," determined to quickly restore this machine tool and put it into production as soon as possible. Everyone proudly said, "What bourgeois 'experts' and 'authorities'? They are nothing! We workers have the most practical experience and are the natural masters of technology!"

In the battle to improve and repair this machine tool, we seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, united with revolutionary technicians and revolutionary cadres, and formed a "three-in-one combination" group with workers as the main body, carrying out a series of reforms. In the midst of the triumphant songs of achieving a comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution, in March of this year, this large-scale special-purpose combination machine tool, which had been sentenced to death by bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," finally regained its life. After it was put into production, it performed efficiently, ensured quality, and the production efficiency increased by more than twofold, making the weak link of the machine bed cavity pass the test.

The fallacies of the bourgeois technological "authorities" were thoroughly exposed in the face of ironclad facts.

We workers have seized control of the factory, including technological power. The wisdom and creativity long suppressed by the revisionist line have been liberated. Now, our factory is bustling with activity, and the entire factory is in a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly smashing unreasonable rules and regulations, and the political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses have reached unprecedented heights. Revolution leads production and promotes production, creating the highest production level since the factory was established in July, and August's production increased over July. Various workshops continuously emerge with technological innovation projects, and three important new products have been manufactured. The great creativity of the working class has shattered all the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk. Their revisionist technological line has been thoroughly defeated!

"The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish," this is a great truth. We workers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will certainly hold power well and use power well, and certainly create miracles that bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" dare not even imagine.

    技术大权我们工人掌定了
    北京第一机床厂工人　黎新功
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，在搞好斗、批、改的高潮中，我们万分高兴地读了九月五日报上发表的《红旗》杂志重要编者按。这个编者按提出的各项无产阶级的政策，是伟大领袖毛主席的声音，说出了我们的心里话，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。我们完全拥护，坚决照办。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”毛主席他老人家最相信我们工人，最支持我们工人。我们工人阶级一定要把工厂的领导权，包括技术大权，牢牢地掌握在自己手里，绝不辜负毛主席的希望。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼、大叛徒，站在地主资产阶级的立场上，胡说什么“不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题的”，要“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”。实际上，他就是要依靠走资派和资产阶级的“专家”“权威”。真是反动透顶！
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的统治下，我们厂一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术
  “权威”，专了我们工人的政。他们凭着窃取的技术大权，千方百计地压制我们工人，给我们的技术革新设置重重关卡。我们搞技术革新，要经过从工段到车间和厂部各科室的层层审批手续，过二十八道关卡，才能进行革新试验；如果违反这些清规戒律，试验工具就被他们当作“黑工具”给没收掉。这样，就完全剥夺了我们工人在技术上创造发明的权利。他们还胡说什么：“工人笨，只能拿镐头把。技术嘛，要靠‘专家’‘权威’”。这是对我们工人阶级的恶毒污蔑。
    毛主席说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。事实正是这样。
    我们厂加工车间，床身膛孔是一个薄弱环节。一九五九年，厂内走资派贯彻中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的修正主义路线，撇开我们工人，找了几个没有实践经验的技术人员去解决这个问题。他们在求大求洋的思想指导下，花了二十几万元，设计制造了一台“自动控制”的大型专用组合机床。由于脱离生产实际，照抄外国，制造以后，精度、轴距、光洁度、自动控制等等都存在着一系列严重的问题，甚至连刀杆也推不进去，根本没法投产。我们工人看在眼里，急在心里，纷纷提出合理化建议。但走资派、资产阶级技术“权威”把持着大权，对我们工人的建议根本不理睬，却组织了几个“洋包子”去“攻关”。可是，这几个“洋包子”也不中用，在机床面前，大眼瞪小眼，毫无办法。最后，还是不了了之，使这一台机床成为废物，整整躺了九个年头，严重地影响了生产。
    我们工人对这种浪费国家财产的犯罪行为，实在不能容忍，决心自己动手，进行改进、修复工作。可是，资产阶级“权威”并不甘心服输，跳出来挑衅，恶狠狠地说：“不准动，谁弄坏了谁负责！”我们工人不买他的账，还是照样干。我们干起来了，他们又大泼冷水，说什么“没用，这台机床只有砸铁。”并且又利用职权，在人力、原料、工具等方面进行百般刁难。例如，要磨一把刀，本来十分钟就可以解决的，他们却卡了一个多月。在改革一个胎具时，一个资产阶级
  “权威”甚至说：“改胎？你能把它改出来，我脑袋揪给你。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，是吓不倒、难不倒的。我们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，群策群力，冲破重重困难，不到半年时间，胜利地把这个胎具改成了。我们就是这样一面斗争，一面干活的。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线冲得落花流水，他所贩卖的一套“专家治厂”，“洋奴哲学”，“爬行哲学”等，都被我们工人的铁扫帚扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，我们从一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”手中夺回了工厂领导权，包括技术大权，真正成了工厂的主人。我们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，决心尽快地把这台机床全部修复，使它早日投入生产。大家豪迈地说：“什么资产阶级的‘专家’‘权威’，统统不在话下！我们工人阶级最有实践经验，最有才能，是技术上当然的主人！”
    在改进、修复这台机床的战斗中，我们认真活学活用毛主席著作，团结革命的技术人员和革命的领导干部，组成了以工人为主体的“三结合”小组，进行了一系列改革。在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，今年三月，这台被资产阶级“专家”“权威”判了死刑的大型专用组合机床，终于获得了新的生命。投产以后，发挥了高效能，保证了质量，生产效率提高两倍多，使床身膛孔这一薄弱环节过了关。
    资产阶级技术“权威”的谬论，在铁的事实面前彻底破产了。
    我们工人掌握了厂的领导权，包括技术大权，长期被修正主义路线压抑的聪明才智和创造力，解放出来了。现在，我们厂出现一派热气腾腾的景象，全厂掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮，大破不合理的规章制度，群众的政治觉悟和革命积极性空前提高。革命统帅生产、推动生产，七月份创造了建厂以来最高生产水平，八月份的生产又比七月份有所增长。各车间的技术革新项目不断出现，并制成了三种重要新产品。我们工人阶级的伟大创造，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫之流的一切反动谬论。他们推行的修正主义技术路线，彻底完蛋了！
      “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，这是一个伟大的真理。我们工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，一定能掌好权、用好权，一定能创造出资产阶级“专家”“权威”连想也不敢想的人间奇迹。
