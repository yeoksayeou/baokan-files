"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 16th, stating that the revolutionary people of Thailand have deeply felt in their revolutionary struggle that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. The article emphasizes that the great Mao Zedong Thought must be combined with the specific conditions of the Thai revolution, and that revolution must rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

The article says that Chairman Mao Zedong is the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the guiding light for the world's revolutionary people, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The article points out that the great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong not only led the Chinese people in a long-term revolutionary struggle, achieving comprehensive victory in the national democratic revolution, and great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also, at present, is achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that socialist China does not change color and becomes a stronghold of the world revolution. He has also pointed out the direction of struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries for the peoples of all countries in the world.

The article says that through the practice of struggle, we have clearly seen the greatness and invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, proving that as long as we firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the people's revolution will surely achieve final victory. The revolutionary practice of Thailand under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand also proves that as long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought and combine it with the specific conditions of the Thai revolution, our revolution will advance and achieve victory. The victories achieved in the armed struggle of the Thai people over the past three years are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article says that when the Communist Party of Thailand published the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Thai, it once again called on party members, cadres, armed fighters, and all revolutionary people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, thoroughly transform their worldview, and use the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to seriously work and solve various problems. It also called on everyone to study Chairman Mao's military works and let the great Mao Zedong Thought shine over the land of Thailand. This is a call of great significance for seizing the victory of the Thai revolutionary struggle.

The article quotes Vice Chairman Lin Biao as saying: "What is the best weapon? It is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. What is the greatest fighting force? The greatest fighting force is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death."

The article emphasizes that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and combine it with our country's revolutionary practice, and insist on Mao Zedong Thought guiding all our work, we will surely be able to finally defeat the American imperialist invaders and the Thanom-Baibo traitorous clique.

    毛泽东思想是世界革命的指路明灯
    新华社十八日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十六日广播一篇文章指出，泰国革命人民在革命斗争实践中深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是当代被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的指针。文章强调，必须把伟大的毛泽东思想同泰国革命的具体情况结合起来，干革命必须靠毛泽东思想。
    文章说，毛泽东主席是全世界革命人民的伟大导师，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义发展的最高水平，是全世界人民革命的指路明灯，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器。
    文章指出，伟大导师毛泽东主席不仅带领中国人民进行长期的革命斗争，取得了民族民主革命的全面胜利，取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，特别在目前，正在取得无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，保证了社会主义的中国不改变颜色，并成为世界革命的坚强堡垒。他老人家还给世界各国人民指明了反帝、反修、反对一切反动派的斗争方向。
    文章说，通过斗争实践，我们清楚看到毛泽东思想的伟大和战无不胜的威力，证明了只要坚决遵循毛泽东主席的革命路线，人民的革命就必定能够取得最后的胜利。泰国共产党领导下的泰国革命实践也证明，只要掌握好毛泽东思想，并同泰国革命具体情况相结合，我们的革命就能前进并取得胜利。泰国人民武装斗争三年来所取得的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    文章说，泰国共产党在泰文《毛泽东选集》出版的时候，再一次号召党员、干部、人民武装战士以及所有革命人民更广泛深入地活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底改造自己的世界观，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法认真地去工作和解决各种问题，专心学习毛泽东主席的军事著作，让伟大的毛泽东思想光辉普照泰国大地。这是为夺取泰国革命斗争胜利的具有伟大意义的号召。
    文章引用林彪副主席的话说：“什么是最好的武器？不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。什么是最大的战斗力？最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”
    文章强调说，只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，并同我国的革命实践相结合，坚持毛泽东思想统帅我们的一切工作，我们就必定能够最后打败美帝国主义侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团。
