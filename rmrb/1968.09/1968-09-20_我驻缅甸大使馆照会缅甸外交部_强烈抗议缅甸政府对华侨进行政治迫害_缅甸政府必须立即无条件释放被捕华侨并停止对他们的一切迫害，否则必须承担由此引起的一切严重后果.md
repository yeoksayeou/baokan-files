	The Chinese Embassy in Burma has sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the Burmese government's political persecution of Chinese residents. The Burmese government must immediately and unconditionally release the detained Chinese residents and stop all forms of persecution against them. Otherwise, they must bear all serious consequences that arise from this.

	BEIJING, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) — YANGON — The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 18, strongly protesting the Burmese government's further political persecution of patriotic Chinese students Yang Derong and the parents of students Chen Bofu and seven others, who were illegally sentenced by a court controlled by the Burmese government.

	The note said that in order to escape its serious crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination, the Burmese government has, over the past year, illegally arrested and detained Yang Derong and Chen Bofu and seven other patriotic Chinese residents, and subjected them to torture in prison. Subsequently, they were tried and illegally sentenced on fabricated charges such as "inciting student unrest" and "obstructing teachers from performing their duties." The Chinese Embassy has repeatedly lodged strong protests against this. The victims themselves also presented a large amount of ironclad evidence in court to expose the Burmese government's anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination, refuting the so-called charges against them.

	The note said that even the testimony of the plaintiffs in court fully shows that the charges imposed on them by the Burmese government are completely fabricated. However, in a situation where the Burmese government is at a loss for words, it became so angry that it said the testimony of the plaintiffs in court does not count, but rather the so-called testimony given in the police station should be used as the basis. Before the previous case was concluded, it secretly tried Yang Derong and Chen Bofu and seven others in the Yansheng Prison on the fabricated charge of "obstructing students from returning home with their parents" and illegally sentenced them.

	The note pointed out that this not only fully proves that the so-called "legal procedures of the Union of Burma" are merely tools used by the Burmese government to oppose China and persecute Chinese residents, but also shows that the Burmese government is stubbornly pursuing an anti-China policy and is going further and further down the road of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination.

	The note said that it is well known that the charges made by the Burmese government against Yang Derong and Chen Bofu and seven other patriotic Chinese residents are completely fabricated and are sheer lies! The Burmese government today insists on imposing this charge on Yang Derong and other patriotic Chinese residents. The Chinese Embassy must point out that it is the Burmese government that organized military, police, secret agents, and thugs to surround, beat, arrest, and detain hundreds of innocent patriotic Chinese students! It is the Burmese government that used force to deprive Chinese students of their freedom of movement and forced them to be separated from their parents! Yang Derong and Chen Bofu and seven other patriotic Chinese residents are completely innocent; the farce of this trial staged by the Burmese government is completely unreasonable.

	The note finally stressed that the Embassy of the People's Republic of China solemnly demands that the Burmese government immediately and unconditionally release Yang Derong and Chen Bofu and seven other patriotic Chinese residents, and immediately stop all forms of persecution against them. Otherwise, the Burmese government must bear all serious consequences that arise from this.

    我驻缅甸大使馆照会缅甸外交部
    强烈抗议缅甸政府对华侨进行政治迫害
    缅甸政府必须立即无条件释放被捕华侨并停止对他们的一切迫害，否则必须承担由此引起的一切严重后果
    新华社十九日讯　仰光消息：中华人民共和国驻缅甸大使馆十八日照会缅甸外交部，就缅甸政府操纵其御用法庭，对爱国华侨学生杨德荣和学生家长陈伯甫等八人进一步进行政治迫害并非法判处他们徒刑，再次向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说，缅甸政府为了逃脱其反华排华的严重罪行和嫁罪于受害华侨，一年多来，对杨德荣和陈伯甫等八名爱国华侨进行非法逮捕、关押并在狱中对他们施以刑罚；继而又以“挑动学生闹事”和“妨碍教员执行职务”等虚构的罪名，分别对他们开庭审讯和非法判决。对此，中华人民共和国大使馆已多次提出强烈抗议；受害华侨本人也在法庭上列举大量铁的事实揭露了缅甸政府反华排华的真相，驳斥了对他们的所谓起诉。
    照会说，连原告证人在法庭上的证词也充分表明缅甸政府加在他们身上的罪名完全是捏造的。但是，缅甸政府在理屈词穷的情况下，竟恼羞成怒，说什么原告证人在法庭上的证词不算数，而要以在警察局的所谓证词为依据，在前案未了的情况下，又以“阻碍学生随父母返家”的虚构罪名，对杨德荣和陈伯甫等八人在永盛监狱进行秘密审讯，并对他们作出非法判决。
    照会指出，这不仅充分地证明缅甸政府所谓的“缅甸联邦法律程序”只不过是其用来进行反对中国、迫害华侨的一个工具，而且表明，缅甸政府顽固推行反华政策，在反华排华道路上越走越远。
    照会说，众所周知，缅甸政府对杨德荣和陈伯甫等八名爱国华侨的指控完全是捏造，是彻头彻尾的谎言！缅甸政府今天硬要把这条罪名强加在杨德荣等爱国华侨头上，中国大使馆必须指出：组织军、警、特务和暴徒包围、殴打、逮捕和关押数百名无辜爱国华侨学生的不是别人，正是缅甸政府！使用武力剥夺了华侨学生行动自由并迫使他们与父母分离的不是别人，正是缅甸政府！杨德荣和陈伯甫等八名爱国华侨根本无罪；缅甸政府导演的这一幕审判丑剧完全是没有道理的。
    照会最后强调指出，中华人民共和国大使馆严正要求缅甸政府立即无条件释放杨德荣和陈伯甫等八名爱国华侨，并立即停止对他们的一切迫害。否则，缅甸政府必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
