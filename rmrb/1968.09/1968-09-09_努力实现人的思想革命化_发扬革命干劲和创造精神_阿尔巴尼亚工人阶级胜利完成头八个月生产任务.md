The heroic Albanian working class, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, has actively implemented the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, striving to achieve the ideological revolution of the people, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit and creative spirit, and successfully completing the production tasks for the first eight months of this year.

In the petroleum industry, statistics show that the production plan for crude oil in the first eight months of this year was completed at 104 percent, with more than 100,000 tons of crude oil produced compared to the same period last year. The workers of the Stalin City State Petroleum Refining Company not only overfulfilled the production tasks but also significantly reduced production costs. The oil drillers in this city also drilled several new oil wells. During the same period, the workers of the Marinez Oil Industry Company in the Patos Oil Field produced an additional 2,300 tons of oil. Currently, the workers are striving to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule.

In the chemical industry, the workers of the Fier Soda Factory have been working selflessly to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy. By the end of August, the factory had produced several hundred tons of soda more than planned. The Elbasan Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory, which directly supports agricultural production, has overproduced by more than 5,700 tons of phosphatic fertilizer.

The broad masses of workers in the machinery industry have carried forward the revolutionary pioneering spirit and achieved good production results in the first eight months of this year. The Tirana Factory has built new workshops and production lines this year, adding many new products, and providing a large amount of materials for the electrification of rural areas. The workers of the Tirana Geological and Mining Machinery Factory have pooled their collective wisdom to produce and begin mass production of new products such as hand-held drilling machines with a drilling capacity of 70 meters and water pumps. The workers of the Durres Agricultural Machinery Factory have carried out technological innovations, fully utilizing potential, and in eight months produced more than 300 ventilators, 125 threshers, and more than 200 corn shellers, strongly supporting agricultural production.

The workers in the transportation sector have smoothly completed the transportation plan for the first eight months of this year. The energetic workers of the Fier Port have launched a socialist labor competition of quick loading and unloading, and completed the transportation tasks for the first eight months ahead of schedule by August 20. The workers of the Durres Port have transported 12,500 tons of goods more than planned. The drivers of the Berat-Ura Vajgurori State Automobile Transportation Company have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and continuous fighting, often driving day and night to transport coal, asphalt, coal, and fertilizers. They have completed the transportation tasks for the first eight months of this year ahead of schedule by mid-August, with an additional five million kilometers of driving.

The production tasks for electricity, cement, and asphalt in the first eight months of this year have also been overfulfilled.

The workers in the light industry sector have also created outstanding production achievements. The production plan for cotton cloth in the first eight months was completed at 106 percent, and the production plan for wool was completed at 103 percent. Wood processing, shoe manufacturing, and edible oil production have all overfulfilled the production plans.

In addition, the broad masses of workers in the machine and tractor stations have made outstanding contributions to supporting agricultural production in the first eight months of this year. Many tractor stations not only completed the tasks ahead of schedule but also used their brains, found ways, and saved a large amount of fuel.

According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the workers of the Stalin Textile Combine, like the working class throughout Albania, have made rapid progress in production by striving to achieve the ideological revolution of the people and actively proposing revolutionary initiatives.

The workers of this factory have launched a vigorous socialist competition to excellently complete the production targets of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970). They have guaranteed to complete the plan ahead of schedule and reach the production targets by 1970. So far, more than 1,000 workers in this factory have completed the production targets ahead of schedule.

The workers of this factory have not only increased production but also actively proposed rationalization initiatives to increase the variety of products and improve product quality. In the first half of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the woolen mill has increased 24 new varieties that the people love. The cotton spinning technology has also made great strides. So far, 20 new varieties have been produced, and more than 200 new patterns have been designed for printing cotton cloth. Other textile factories and combines in Albania have also completed the production targets ahead of schedule.

The ideological revolution movement in Albania has promoted the rapid development of industry, and the workers' enthusiasm for labor is high. The picture shows workers at the Berat Mao Zedong Textile Combine at work.
