甲: I am in my fourth year of university.
	Together: We are two brothers,
	Now performing a cross-talk.

	(Drums and cheers suddenly rise)
乙: Drums beat urgently,
	Slogans soar to the sky,
	Chairman Mao issued a new directive,
	Reporting this good news to my elder brother.
	Hey! Look, my elder brother is coming,
	Elder brother, why are you walking so hurriedly today?
甲: You startled me, it's just you, my younger brother,
	I was just looking for you.
乙: What for?
甲: To report some good news to you.
乙: Let me tell you first,
甲: Let me tell you first,
	Together: Chairman Mao issued a new directive,
甲:
乙:
	(Simultaneously) Elder brother, younger brother, I am so happy!
	Together: Chairman Mao said: "Students trained in old schools, most or the majority can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have even made inventions and innovations, but they need to be under the correct leadership, re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers."
甲: Chairman Mao's words are a guiding light,
乙: Every word and sentence is the truth,
甲: This is the greatest care for us,
乙: This is the greatest encouragement for us.
甲: The path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers is broad and wide,
乙: The future of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers is bright and limitless.
甲: Chairman Mao points the way for us,
乙: We must follow closely and never leave.
甲: Younger brother, I am going to the factory tomorrow,
乙: Elder brother, I am going to the frontier tomorrow.
甲: You are going too?
乙: What? You disagree?
甲: I agree, I have long agreed!
乙: That's more like it.
甲: Younger brother, what are you taking with you to the frontier?
乙: Four volumes of precious books in hand,
甲: Golden light shining across ten thousand miles,
乙: A pickaxe and a large hoe,
甲: Opening up a new world.
乙: Forever uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants,
	Together: Receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers!
甲: Younger brother, I recall past events, one by one, and cannot help but feel angry.
乙: Elder brother, what are you thinking about?
甲: We are both sons of poor peasants,
乙: It is the laboring people who raised us,
甲: The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought nourished us,
乙: Workers, peasants, and soldiers sent us to school to study,
甲: We should have served the poor and lower-middle peasants,
乙: Applied our knowledge to practice.
甲: But the evil Chinese Khrushchev,
乙: Vigorously promoted revisionist education,
甲: Did not let us leave the school gates,
乙: Kept us locked in the house all day,
甲: Inculcated us with Confucius and Mencius,
乙: The stinking logic of seeking official posts and wealth,
甲: Made us detached from labor,
乙: Detached from reality,
甲: If anyone got close to workers, peasants, and soldiers,
乙: They would say you have no future.
	Together: This is truly outrageous!
甲: Younger brother, do you remember when we went back to the countryside that year?
乙: I will never forget that,
甲: Father asked us to weed the fields,
乙: But we couldn't tell the difference between sorghum and corn.
甲: The team asked us to repair the tractor,
乙: We flipped through books for half a day,
甲: Still didn't know where the problem was,
乙: We were so frustrated, just staring blankly,
甲: Father sighed in anger,
乙: At that time, we didn't know why,
	Together: It turns out it was the trickery of Chinese Khrushchev!
甲: The thunder of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution roars across the sky,
乙: Chinese Khrushchev is overthrown,
甲: The old education is smashed,
乙: The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals controlling schools can no longer continue!
甲: The working class leads the schools,
乙: Workers and peasants manage education,
甲: Their thoughts are the purest,
乙: Their revolution is the most thorough.
甲: Their knowledge is the richest,
乙: They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao!
甲: Walk the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers,
乙: Receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers,
甲: This is the direction pointed by Chairman Mao,
乙: This is the law of historical development.
甲: Chairman Mao said: The countryside is a vast world,
乙: There, one can achieve great things.
甲: This is the truth,
乙: This is the truth of revolution.
甲: Revolutionary martyrs, for the revolution,
	Sacrificed their lives, shed their blood,
	Advanced fearlessly, died without regret.
乙: What were they thinking about?
	Together: It was communism!
甲: We must dedicate our youth to the "public" cause,
	Be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.
乙: With a heart embracing the vast seas,
	Eyes observing the winds and thunder of the five continents!
甲: In the vast world,
	Together: Temper and transform ourselves!
甲: Younger brother,
	Look, the people of the entire country are full of spirit, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution,
	Iron water flows, steel flowers bloom,
	Every day and month, miracles are created.
乙: Elder brother, look,
	The commune's rice waves a thousand layers,
	Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread,
	Criticizing selfishness and revisionism, the victory song soars,
	The great criticism flames rise to the sky,
	The motherland's land is in full bloom,
	Every household raises the red flag.
甲: Younger brother, quickly pack your bags,
	Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers as soon as possible,
	Receive re-education.
乙: Elder brother, look!
	Together: The red sun shines on the great earth,
	Its rays are boundless,
	Workers, peasants, and soldiers are beckoning,
	Warmly welcoming us to their midst!
甲: Younger brother, let's go! Go!
	To the factory, roll in oil and mud,
	Transform ourselves through labor,
	The hammer smashes the old world,
	Definitely let the red flag fly over the five continents.
乙: Right, let's go! Go!
	To the frontier!
	Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants,
	A hoe raised, a thousand pounds lifted,
	Opening up a new world!
	Together: Let's go! Go! Go!
	Following the direction pointed by Chairman Mao,
	Go to the workers and peasants to receive re-education,
	Welcome the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
