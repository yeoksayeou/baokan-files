The vast impoverished herdsmen of the grasslands in the Four Princes Banner of Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to fiercely criticize the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia. The spiritual face of the people has undergone tremendous changes. The following are a few small stories that our platoon saw and heard while on duty in the grasslands of the Four Princes Banner.

The New Family Style of Saima

When our platoon arrived at a livestock point in the Baiyanhua Commune, we had not yet had time to steady ourselves when we saw a Mongolian herdsman in his fifties, singing the praises of Chairman Mao's quotations and waving a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," rushing towards us to enthusiastically invite us into his yurt.

The East is red, the sun is rising, shining red in the hearts of the herdsmen. In the center of the yurt, there is a large portrait of Chairman Mao hanging straight and upright. On both sides of the portrait, the words "Follow Chairman Mao, our hearts will never change" shine with red light. Saima and his entire family of three generations respectfully sit in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, holding the golden-red "Little Red Book," studying Chairman Mao's works with questions, and consciously fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Saima introduced that this is their new family style. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia advocated what kind of "national" and "family" customs, but did not advocate learning Mao Zedong Thought. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened the eyes of the impoverished herdsmen, exposed the capitalist roaders, and criticized the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, establishing a revolutionary new family style in every household.

Dugur's "Semiconductor"

Recently, the impoverished herdsman, Old Man Dugur, bought a transistor radio. Someone said, "Old Dugur is getting younger every day, wanting to listen to singing." Dugur said, "Yes! In the old society, I suffered enough. Today, with the benevolent Chairman Mao, life is getting better and better. I just want to listen to some singing and feel young."

In fact, Dugur's purpose in buying the transistor radio was not to listen to singing. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has begun, and Old Man Dugur has learned Chairman Mao's teachings about "you must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Comparing himself to the good soldier of Mao Zedong, Liu Yingjun, he decided to be a red vanguard in enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. With the transistor radio, he could timely receive the voices of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and pass them on to every impoverished herdsman.

On the night of August 15, Old Man Dugur heard from the radio the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao about "our country has a population of 700 million, the working class is the leading class..." At that time, although it was already past midnight, the sky was dark and cold, but he paid no heed to these things. He immediately dressed himself, lit the oil lamp, and hung Chairman Mao's portrait upright at the top of the yurt. He promptly conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the surrounding impoverished herdsmen. The impoverished herdsmen excitedly waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" Sincerely wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Dabuge Attends the Struggle Session

Dabuge's speech at the commune's struggle session against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia shook the entire commune of impoverished herdsmen.

Dabuge was born into a slave family and suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the princes and landlords from a young age. In those difficult days, he was so oppressed that he could not say a word for three days. It was the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that finally allowed Dabuge to stand up. Not long ago, he heard that the commune was going to struggle against the capitalist roaders, and he could no longer contain his excitement. He said, "I support Chairman Mao's instructions with all my heart and will fight to the end; even if I can only say one sentence, I will open fire on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia!" But he had a poor memory, remembering one sentence and forgetting another. What should he do? Chairman Mao's teachings about "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory" gave him boundless strength. He thought while walking, thought while sitting, spoke at home, and spoke while herding. Sometimes he thought and spoke all day and night. In this way, he spent more than ten days preparing a speech. He happily told others, "I will go on stage to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia like a soldier going to battle, fighting to the end."

On the day the commune held the struggle session, Dabuge drove a cart, bringing his entire family, and rushed through the rain for more than seventy miles to participate. He shouted the slogan of firmly overthrowing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, stepped onto the stage, and criticized the capitalist roaders until he was sweating profusely and shivering. The broad masses of impoverished herdsmen attending the meeting unanimously praised his speech: "Every sentence hit the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly suppressing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie."

    草原新貌
    内蒙古自治区乌兰察布盟四子王旗牧区广大贫苦牧民，在无产阶级文化大革命中用毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人的反革命修正主义黑货，人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。下面是我们连队在四子王旗牧区值勤时，看到和听到的几则小故事。
    赛木亚的新家风
    我们连队来到白彦花公社的一个畜牧点时，还没有等站稳脚跟，就见一位五十岁上下的蒙古族牧民，高唱着毛主席语录歌，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，迎面跑来，热情地邀请我们进他的蒙古包。
    东方红，太阳升，照得牧民心里红彤彤。蒙古包里的正中央端端正正地挂着毛主席的巨幅画像，画像的两侧“跟着毛主席，誓死心不变”十个大字闪耀着红色的光芒。赛木亚全家老小三代恭恭敬敬地坐在毛主席像前，手持金光闪闪的红色宝书，带着问题学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的教导同自己的思想、工作对号，自觉地斗私批修。赛木亚介绍说，这是他们的新家风。过去中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，提倡什么民族“风”，家庭“风”，就是不提倡学习毛泽东思想。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命擦亮了贫苦牧民的眼睛，揪出了走资派，批臭了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人散布的流毒，家家树立了革命新家风。
    都古尔的“半导体”
    贫苦牧民都古尔老大爷，最近买了一架半导体收音机。有人说：“老都越活越年轻了，想听起唱来了。”都古尔说：“是啊！在旧社会受够了罪，今天有了恩人毛主席，生活越过越好，就是要听听唱，年轻年轻。”
    其实，都古尔买半导体收音机的目的，并不是为了听唱。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命开始了，都古尔老大爷学习了毛主席关于“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，对照毛主席的好战士刘英俊的英雄事迹，决心做热情宣传毛泽东思想的红尖兵。有了半导体收音机，就可以把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音及时收下来，传达给每个贫苦牧民。
    八月十五日深夜，都古尔老大爷从收音机里听到了伟大领袖毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。……”的最新指示，当时，虽然已经是深夜十二点多了，天又黑又冷，但他不顾这些，立刻穿好衣服，点亮奶油灯，把毛主席画像端端正正地挂在蒙古包的顶上，及时向周围的贫苦牧民传达了毛主席的这一最新指示。贫苦牧民们激动地挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，纵情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”衷心地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    达不盖出席批斗会
    达不盖在公社批斗中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人大会上的发言，震动了全公社的贫苦牧民。
    达不盖出身于奴隶家庭，从小就受尽了王爷、牧主的剥削和压迫。在那苦难的日子里，他被压榨得三天说不了一句话。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命才使达不盖彻底翻了身。不久前，听说公社要批斗走资派，他再也按捺不住激动的心，他说：“毛主席的指示我一万个拥护，万万个支持；那怕说一句话也要向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人开炮！”可是，他记忆不好，想起了这一句，忘了那一句，怎么办呢？毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，给了他无穷的力量。他走着想，坐着也想，在家说，放牧时也说，有时整天整夜地想呀，说呀。就这样，他整整用了十多天时间，终于准备好了一个发言，他高兴地对人说：“我要象解放军上战场那样，登台批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，打他个刺刀见红。”
    公社召开批判大会那一天，达不盖赶着骡骡车，拉着全家人，冒雨跑了七十多里路赶来参加。他高呼坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人的口号，登上主席台，把走资派批得上身冒汗下身哆嗦。参加会的广大贫苦牧民一致称赞他的发言：“句句打在中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人的身上，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。”　  解放军某部三连
