The Malay newspaper *The Struggle* published in Singapore recently carried an article exposing the intensified economic infiltration of Singapore by U.S. imperialism.

The article says that as early as 1965, the Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime signed an agreement with the U.S. to "guarantee the rights of American investments in Singapore." This agreement opened the door for American economic infiltration and control of Singapore.

The article cites data from the *Far Eastern Economic Review* stating that up to now, the total amount of private American investments in Singapore has reached 185 million Singapore dollars, of which 120 million Singapore dollars have been invested in the oil refining and sales industry. The article says that in terms of trade, the value of goods exported from Singapore to the U.S. last year was 244 million Singapore dollars, an increase of 50.6 percent over 1966. The value of goods imported from the U.S. to Singapore last year was 245.5 million Singapore dollars, an increase of 16 percent over 1966.

The article points out: "From the above data, it is clear that whether in terms of investment or trade, the U.S. has gradually replaced the former colonial power—Britain. In other words, the U.S. economic infiltration of Singapore has reached a serious level. This also indicates that the Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime has actually gradually become an agent of U.S. imperialism in this region. Its so-called 'neutrality without leaning towards the U.S.' is in essence pro-U.S., flattering the U.S., and relying on the U.S."

    美帝加紧对新加坡进行经济侵略
    在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》不久前发表文章，揭露美帝国主义加紧对新加坡进行经济渗透。
    文章说，早在一九六五年，李光耀傀儡集团就同美帝签订了“保障美国在新加坡投资权益”的协定，这个协定给美国对新加坡进行经济渗透与控制打开了方便之门。
    文章援引《远东经济评论》的资料说，到目前为止，美国在新加坡的私人投资总额增加到一亿八千五百万元（新加坡币），其中石油提炼和销售业的投资为一亿二千万元。文章说，在贸易方面，去年新加坡输往美国的货物价值为二亿四千四百万元（新加坡币），比一九六六年增加百分之五十点六。去年由美国输入新加坡的货物价值为二亿四千五百五十万元，比一九六六年增加百分之十六。
    文章指出：“从上述资料中，我们可以清楚看出：无论是投资或贸易方面，美国已经逐步取代前宗主国——英国的地位，也就是说美国对新加坡经济的渗透，已经达到了严重的地步，这也表明李光耀傀儡集团实际上已经逐步沦为美帝国主义在这个地区的代理人，它所谓的‘中立不亲美’，实质是亲美、媚美、靠美。”
