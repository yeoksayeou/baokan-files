At dawn, the campus of Peking University was filled with joy. The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary teachers and students formed neat rows in front of the statue of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and singing "The East is Red." Amidst the powerful and resonant song, a new day of struggle began.

The campus of New Peking University, the squares, and the roadsides were all bathed in the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The majority or a large majority of students educated in the old schools can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's great teachings expressed the feelings of revolutionary teachers and students, pointing out a bright path of revolution and labor for the broad masses of intellectuals. Intellectuals educated by the bourgeoisie must consciously accept the re-education of the proletariat. The teachers and students of Peking University have had personal experiences in their interactions with the workers' propaganda team. Look, the members of the workers' propaganda team and the Red Guards are studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, having heart-to-heart talks. They talk so warmly, their hearts are so close, and they laugh so happily!

The main passageways of the school are adorned with newly painted slogans celebrating the achievement of revolutionary unity across the entire school, shining with red light. It tells us that the revolutionary teachers and students of New Peking University, under the leadership of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have taken big strides to follow the footsteps of the billion people of the nation.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who sent the workers' propaganda team. Since then, a strong east wind has blown into the campus of New Peking University, dispersing the mist of bourgeois factionalism, and uniting the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students! Looking back at the past and comparing it to the present, who would not be filled with joy and excitement from the bottom of their heart!

"Workers' propaganda team enters Peking University, Peking University changes day by day." What changes? Let's look at the changes in the Class of 1953 of the Department of Technical Physics!

When it comes to the Class of 1953, no one in the entire school is unaware of it. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, their class was united like one person. Later, bourgeois factionalism split them apart.

The Class of 1953 was the first to split in the entire school.

After the workers' propaganda team from the First Machine Tool Factory moved into Peking University, they settled down in the Class of 1953. With their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, they helped the students study Mao Zedong Thought, live together, and fight together. They used their exemplary actions to lead the students to achieve revolutionary unity.

At the beginning, the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions were very serious. Some said: "This time the workers' propaganda team came, they must settle who is right and who is wrong, and let the truth come out." Old worker Wang Can affectionately told them: "Our factory originally had four organizations and two factions. The two factions were like gunpowder, ready to explode at any moment. Just when we were unsure of the direction, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: 'Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.' We realized that we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and only achieve unity, never split up and each go our own way. As a result, the entire factory achieved revolutionary unity the next day, and soon established a revolutionary committee, launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation." Through the propaganda team's in-depth and detailed ideological work, everyone realized: the earlier we unite, the more we win; the later we unite, the more we help the enemy. We must unite immediately and fight together against the enemy. Once the thoughts are clear, everything is clear. The masses immediately demanded that the leaders unite, banging drums and gongs.

The masses urged the leaders, and the leaders led the masses. The responsible persons of the two factions' mass organizations, who were in the midst of negotiations, immediately expressed: "We are the leaders of the masses. We must be the locomotive of the masses' progress and never a stumbling block in the way." During the election of the representatives of the revolutionary unity committee, the responsible person of the original Jian'gangshan first proposed, "The New Peking Commune has more people, they should have three representatives, and we can have two."

"No, that's not right! It should be two for us and three for you." The responsible person of the original New Peking Commune said.

Just as they were insisting on their positions, the PLA comrades on the scene happily suggested: "We have already united, let the masses choose whoever they trust!" The PLA comrades' suggestion was met with a round of enthusiastic applause.

The election results were three for the New Peking Commune and two for Jian'gangshan. Amidst the enthusiastic applause, they shook hands. Their hearts were united. Everyone reviewed the situation from the previous period and said meaningfully: In the previous period, we did not follow Chairman Mao closely enough and fell behind a step. Now we must catch up with the billion people's forward steps with the speed of a hundred-meter dash and carry out the educational revolution of New Peking University to the end!

The news of the revolutionary unity of the Class of 1953 quickly spread throughout the school. Everyone expressed their desire to learn from them. The entire school immediately saw a high tide of revolutionary unity! Everyone enthusiastically banged drums and gongs to report the good news to the headquarters of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

Within a few days, all eighteen departments of the school achieved revolutionary unity. The campus of Peking University changed, and the revolutionary spring breeze blew, making every sunflower bloom towards the sun!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University sang such a song:

Peking University, Peking University,
The workers' propaganda team brought great changes,
In the past, each faction occupied its own mountain,
Now the mountains are leveled, and we are united as one family.
Peking University, Peking University,
The changes are truly great,
Mao Zedong Thought blooms with red flowers.

The environment of Peking University changed, the political atmosphere changed, and people's thoughts changed. Zeng Lijuan, a student in the first year of Korean language in the Department of Oriental Languages, is one of them.

Zeng Lijuan was originally one of the earliest Red Guards to oppose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party during the early days of the Cultural Revolution and had made contributions. Later, due to the poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line, she and many of her comrades split apart and were long obsessed with occupying hills and "fighting internal wars."

In early August, the "internal war" stopped, and Zeng Lijuan returned home. She stayed at home for more than twenty days. During these days, although she was at home, her heart was still with her organization. One day, she suddenly saw in the newspaper that Chairman Mao had given mangoes to the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Tsinghua University. Following that, she heard on the radio about Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution and the news of the workers' propaganda team entering Peking University. These heart-stirring news shook Zeng's heart, igniting her enthusiasm to return to school and participate in the revolution. She said: "Chairman Mao instructs me to act, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance!"

On September 1st, Zeng Lijuan returned to school, just like in the past, she went straight to the headquarters of her organization. However, when she arrived at the headquarters, her classmates told her: the headquarters had stopped working, and everyone had returned to their original departments, classes, and dormitories to carry out the revolution. Zeng, unable to contain her emotions, said: "Ah, it has changed!" She returned to her dormitory and saw that her classmates, regardless of factions, were living together; she walked out of the dormitory and saw her classmates gathering under the shade of the trees, having heart-to-heart talks, and being intimate; looking at the big character posters on the squares and walls, the slogans of mutual attacks were gone, and they were filled with red joyous reports of achieving revolutionary unity... All this was so sudden and fresh to Zeng! She saw it with her own eyes and was happy in her heart. She never dreamed that the "old difficult problem" of the two factions' long-term opposition for a year or two would be solved by the workers' propaganda team in just one day. In just one day, the education Zeng received was so great! She deeply felt the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and deeply felt the great significance of fully playing the leading role of the working class.

The next day, she enthusiastically participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the important article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan with her classmates. At the meeting, she bravely made a self-criticism, criticizing her bourgeois factionalism, and said: "Chairman Mao's latest instructions hit my heart and struck the vital points of my thoughts. I am determined to correct my mistakes, accept the leadership of the worker elders, accept the re-education of the workers, and forever follow Chairman Mao, forever advance towards Chairman Mao, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!" After the meeting, she actively sought out her opposing classmates for heart-to-heart talks, made self-criticisms, and formed a pair of reds with Xiaokang, her "enemy" during the Cultural Revolution. The classmates praised them, saying: "A pair of enemies have become a pair of reds!"

The red sun illuminated every corner of New Peking University. After achieving revolutionary unity, new people and new things emerged one after another.

One day, an incident occurred in the Department of Economics: Li Xingshan, the responsible person of the original Jian'gangshan Column, had a fever of over forty degrees. The worker comrades prepared to send him to the school hospital for treatment, but Li had reservations: most of the people in the school hospital were from the original New Peking Commune, would they treat him well? The worker comrades immediately explained: now that we are united, these reservations are unnecessary.

After being persuaded by the worker comrades, Li reluctantly agreed, but his heart was still filled with doubts.

After entering the hospital, to Li's complete surprise, the doctors not only did not treat him differently but also treated him warmly, giving him injections, sending water, and asking about his health. Just as the doctor was about to give him an injection, Li felt nauseous and, unable to control himself, vomited on the doctor. Li felt uncomfortable, thinking, "This is bad." However, the doctor was not bothered at all and smiled, saying: "It's okay, you lie down and rest well."

In the middle of the night, Li felt unbearable headaches. He couldn't stand it anymore, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. At this time, Han Zhengyao, a comrade from the original New Peking Commune who was sleeping next to him, also had a high fever and couldn't sleep. He discovered that Li was in so much pain that he gritted his teeth and got out of bed to find the doctor. All this deeply moved Li.

The next morning, Liu Jun and other comrades from the original New Peking Commune's Department of Economics, knowing that Li was sick, bought some apples and biscuits to visit him at the school hospital.

When Liu Jun and the other comrades stood by Li's bed, Li could hardly believe his eyes. He thought: Liu Jun was my "enemy" in the past, would he come to see me now? He wiped his eyes and looked again, it was indeed him. At this moment, Li's illness seemed to have disappeared, and a warm current of happiness surged through his body. He thought, Liu Jun and I were originally classmates, the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev split us apart, turning friends into "enemies." Now, the comrades of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team have turned "enemies" into intimate comrades. What a great change! Thinking of this, he became even more happy and, with unwavering confidence, expressed: I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, under the leadership of the workers' propaganda team, actively participate in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry out the educational revolution of the school to the end!

Good deeds are countless, and new words and songs are endless. Under the leadership of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the revolutionary teachers and students of New Peking University are advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

    新北大正沿着毛主席指引的道路阔步前进
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进北京大学后全校面貌一新
    拂晓，北京大学的校园里一片欢腾。工人毛泽东思想宣传队、解放军战士和革命师生，排成整齐的队列，在伟大领袖毛主席的塑像前，举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《东方红》。在雄壮嘹亮的歌声中，迎来了新的战斗的一天。
    新北大的校园里，广场上，道路旁，哪儿不照遍了毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光！毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的这一伟大教导说出了革命师生的心里话，给广大知识分子指出了一条革命化、劳动化的光明大道。受资产阶级教育的知识分子要自觉地接受无产阶级的再教育，北京大学的师生在和工人宣传队相处的日子里，已有切身的体会。你看，工人宣传队的队员同红卫兵小将，正在一起学习毛主席的这一最新指示，一起谈心。他们是谈得那么亲切，他们的心贴得那样近，笑得那么欢畅！
    学校主要通道的两旁，新刷的祝贺全校实现革命大联合的大标语，红光闪闪。它告诉我们，新北大的革命师生在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，已经迈开大步紧跟全国亿万人民的步伐前进。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您派来了工人宣传队。从此，强劲的东风吹进新北大的校园，驱散了资产阶级派性的迷雾，广大的革命师生联合起来了！回想过去，对比现在，谁不从心底欢欣鼓舞！
    （一）
    “工人宣传队进北大，北大一天天起变化。”变化在哪里呢？就从技术物理系三五○年级的变化来看吧！
    提起三五○年级，全校没有人不知道。文化大革命初期，他们班团结得象一个人。后来，资产阶级派性把他们分开了。
    三五○年级是全校分裂最早的一个。
    第一机床厂的工人宣传队进驻北大后，搬到三五○年级住下了。他们怀着忠于毛主席的红心，帮助同学们学习毛泽东思想，一起生活，一起战斗。他们用自己的模范行动，来带动同学们实现革命的大联合。
    开始，两派同学的对立情绪很严重。有的说：“这次工人宣传队来了，一定要搞个谁是谁非，水落石出。”老工人王灿，就亲切地对他们说：“我们厂原来是四大组织两大派，两派之间好象灌足了硝的爆竹，一触即发。就在我们看不准方向的时候，伟大领袖毛主席发出‘在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织’的最新指示，我们就认识到，必须听毛主席的话，只能搞大联合，而决不能散伙，各顾各。结果，第二天全厂就实现了革命大联合，不久又成立了革委会，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。”经过宣传队的一番深入细致的思想工作，使大家认识到：早一分钟联合，就多一分胜利；晚一分钟联合，就等于帮了敌人一分忙。必须立即联合起来，共同对敌。思想一通，万事皆通。群众就敲锣打鼓要求头头联合了。
    群众促头头，头头带群众。正在协商的两派群众组织负责人立即表示说：“我们是群众的头头，我们要做群众前进的火车头，决不做前进中的绊脚石。”在选举大联委代表时，原井冈山的负责人首先提出，“新北大公社的同志人多，他们应该出三名代表，我们出两名就行。”
    “不，不行！应该我们两名，你们三名才对。”原新北大公社的负责人说。
    正在相互坚持不下的时候，在场的解放军同志高兴地提出：“咱们已经联合起来了，群众信任谁就选谁吧！”解放军同志的建议，博得大家一阵热烈的掌声。
    选举的结果，新北大公社三名，井冈山二名。在热烈的掌声中，他们互相握手了。他们的心贴在一起了。大家回顾了前一段的情况，意味深长地说：前一段咱们紧跟毛主席不够，落后了一截，现在咱们要用百米冲线的速度，赶上亿万人民前进的雄伟步伐，把新北大的教育革命进行到底！
    三五○年级实现革命大联合的消息迅速传遍全校。大家都表示要向他们学习。全校立即出现了一个革命大联合的高潮！大家纷纷敲锣打鼓地向工人毛泽东思想宣传队总部报喜。
    几天之内，全校十八个系都实现了革命的大联合。北大的校园变了，革命春风吹拂处，朵朵葵花向阳开！
    北京大学的革命师生，流传着这样的歌：
    北大北大，
    工人宣传队带来大变化，
    过去各霸一方修山头，
    现在削平山头联合成一家。
    北大北大，
    变化真大，
    毛泽东思想开出朵朵红花。
    （二）
    北大的环境变了，政治空气变了，人们的思想也变了。东方语言系朝鲜语一年级的曾丽娟同学，就是其中的一个。
    曾丽娟同学原来是造党内一小撮走资派的反较早的一名红卫兵小将，在文化大革命初期立了功。后来，由于受资产阶级反动路线的毒害，她和许多战友分开了，长期热衷于占山头，“打内战”。
    八月初，“内战”停止了，曾丽娟回了家。她在家里呆了二十多天。在这些日子里，她人在家，心仍然惦记着自己的组织。有一天，她突然从报纸上看到，毛主席赠送芒果给清华大学首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的喜讯。接着，她又从收音机里，听到毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示和工人宣传队进驻北大的消息。这些动人心弦的消息，震撼着小曾的心，使她心里燃起重返学校参加革命的热情。她说：“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”
    九月一日，曾丽娟来到了学校，象过去一样，她迳直往自己组织的总部跑去。但是，到了总部，同学们告诉她：总部停止工作了，大家都回到原系、原班、原宿舍闹革命了。小曾听后情不自禁地说：“啊，变了！”她回到宿舍，看到同学们不分派别，住在一块了；她走出宿舍，看到同学们聚在树荫底下，促膝谈心，亲密无间；再看看广场和墙壁上的大字报专栏，互相攻击的标语没有了，上面贴满了一张张实现革命大联合的红色喜报……。这一切，对小曾来说是多么突然，多么新鲜啊！她看在眼里，乐在心怀。她做梦也没有想到，两大派群众组织一两年来长期对立的“老大难”问题，工人宣传队一来，就解决了。仅仅一天的时间，对小曾的教育是多么大呀！她深深地体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力，深深地体会到充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的伟大意义。
    第二天，她踊跃地参加了毛泽东思想学习班，和同学们一起学习毛主席的最新指示和姚文元同志的重要文章。在会上，她勇敢地作了自我批评，批判自己的资产阶级派性，她说：“毛主席的最新指示字字说到我的心坎上，句句打中我的思想上的要害。我决心改正错误，接受工人老大哥的领导，接受工人对我的再教育，永远紧跟毛主席，永远向着毛主席，永远忠于毛主席！”会后，她主动地找自己对立面的同学谈心，作自我批评，并和自己在文化大革命中形成“冤家对头”的小康同学，结成了一对红，两人决心永远团结在一起，战斗在一起。同学们称赞他们说：“一对冤家变成了一对红！”
    （三）
    红太阳照亮了新北大的各个角落，革命大联合后，新人新事层出不穷。
    一天，经济系发生了这样一件事：原井冈山纵队负责人李兴山发烧四十多度。工人同志准备把他送到校医院治疗，小李却有顾虑：校医院的人大多是原新北大公社的，他们能给我好好治疗吗？工人同志当即解释说：现在联合了，这些顾虑是不必要的。
    经工人同志说服，小李勉强答应了，但心里还是打着个问号。
    进院后，完全出乎小李的意料之外，大夫们不但不另眼看待，而且热情地进行治疗，打针、送水，问寒问暖。当大夫正要给他打针的时候，小李感到一阵噁心，他控制不住，一下子吐在大夫的身上。小李心里可不自在，他想，这下可糟了。可是，大夫却毫不介意，笑着对他说：没关系，你好好躺着休息吧。
    到了深夜，小李感到头疼的不行。他忍耐不住，翻来复去睡不着。这时，睡在他旁边的原新北大公社的韩贞耀同志，也在发高烧，迟迟睡不着觉。他发现小李痛得那样厉害，就咬住牙爬起床找来了大夫。这一切，都使小李深深地感动。
    第二天一早，原新北大公社经济系的负责人刘军和其他同学，知道小李生病的消息后，买了一些苹果和饼干到校医院去看望他。
    当刘军等同志站在小李床边时，小李简直不相信自己的眼睛。他想：刘军过去是我的“冤家对头”，现在他会来看我吗？他擦了擦眼睛，再一看，没错，就是他。这时，小李的病好象全好了，一股幸福的暖流在小李的身上激荡着。他心想，我和刘军本来是同班的战友，中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线把我们分开了，使朋友变成了“仇人”。现在，工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志又使“仇人”变成了亲密无间的战友。这个变化是多么大啊！想到这里，他更加高兴，信心百倍地表示：我一定听毛主席的话，在工人宣传队的领导下，积极参加学校的斗、批、改，把学校的教育革命进行到底！
    好人好事说不尽，新词新歌谱不完。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，新北大的革命师生，正沿着毛主席指引的道路，阔步前进！
