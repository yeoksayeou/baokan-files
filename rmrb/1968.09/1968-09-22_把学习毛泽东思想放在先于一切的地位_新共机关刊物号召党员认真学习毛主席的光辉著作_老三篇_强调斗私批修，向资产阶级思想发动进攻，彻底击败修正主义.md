    Prioritize the Study of Mao Zedong Thought
    The New Zealand Communist Party's official publication calls on party members to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant works, "The Three Articles"
    Emphasize self-criticism and anti-revisionism, launch an offensive against bourgeois ideology, and thoroughly defeat revisionism

    WELLINGTON, Sept. 21 (New China News Agency) — The New Zealand Communist Party's official publication, "New Zealand Communist Review," recently published an article calling on New Zealand Communist Party members to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant works, "The Three Articles." The article points out: "'The Three Articles' are the most fundamental works on the issue of proletarian revolutionary spirit."

    The article states: "Comrade Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage," and therefore, "the study of Mao Zedong Thought must be placed in the foremost position."

    The article calls on New Zealand Communist Party members to "first study Comrade Mao Zedong's 'The Three Articles,' namely, 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' 'Serve the People,' and 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.'" The article continues: "The study of Marxism-Leninism and its highest stage, Comrade Mao Zedong's theory, if not connected with the important theoretical guidance of 'The Three Articles,' if 'The Three Articles' are not repeatedly studied and used as a guide for studying all of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, then such study will not be fully meaningful."

    The article states: Currently, all branches of the New Zealand Communist Party are doing this. Most branches then studied some chapters from "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and from these chapters, they proceeded to study the longer articles from which these quotations were selected by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    The article states: Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in the preface to the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" that the study of Chairman Mao's works should "focus on the practical application." If "The Three Articles" are not thoroughly and repeatedly studied, it will be difficult to follow this guidance. Because the fundamental issue regarding the application of "use" lies in "criticizing and repudiating revisionism." Unless we persistently and continuously struggle against every manifestation of the "self," we will not be able to defeat revisionism.

    The article states: "When we talk about transforming ourselves, we mean to eliminate bourgeois ideology and strive to absorb firm proletarian ideology. What is the standard? It is not what a person says, but how he acts."

    The article emphasizes: "The bourgeoisie will never willingly give up its ruling class position; it must be overthrown. Similarly, the fundamental ideology of the ruling class will never give up its ruling position unless it is overthrown."

    The article states: "The proletarian worldview of Communist Party members can only be manifested in wholeheartedly and unshakably serving the cause of the working class and its party. If we do not launch a constant and conscious offensive against the bourgeois ideology that oppresses us, we will not be able to achieve this, or if we do, we will not be able to fundamentally maintain it."

    The article points out: "'The Three Articles' are precisely the best weapons for launching such an offensive. Anyone who wishes to launch a conscious and constant offensive against every manifestation of the 'self' must truly and constantly read 'The Three Articles.'"

    The article finally emphasizes that the attitude towards "The Three Articles" "indicates whether a person understands the full meaning of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory."

    把学习毛泽东思想放在先于一切的地位
    新共机关刊物号召党员认真学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”
    强调斗私批修，向资产阶级思想发动进攻，彻底击败修正主义
    新华社二十一日讯　惠灵顿消息：新西兰共产党机关刊物《新西兰共产主义评论》不久前发表文章，号召新西兰共产党员认真学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。文章指出：“‘老三篇’是关于无产阶级革命精神问题的最基本的著作”。
    文章说：“毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新阶段”，因此要“把学习毛泽东思想放到必要的先于一切的地位”。
    文章号召新西兰共产党员“先学习毛泽东同志的‘老三篇’，即《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》”。文章接着说：“学习马克思列宁主义及其最高阶段毛泽东同志的理论，如果不同‘老三篇’的理论上的重要教导联系起来，如果不反复学习‘老三篇’，把它们作为学习毛泽东同志的一切著作的指导，那么这种学习是不可能有充分意义的。”
    文章说：目前新西兰共产党所有的支部都这样做了。大部分支部接着学习了《毛主席语录》中的一些章节，然后从这些章节进而学习从中选出这些语录的毛泽东同志的较长的文章。
    文章说：林彪同志在《毛主席语录》再版前言中指出，学习毛主席著作要“在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。如果不是透彻地、反复地学习“老三篇”，是不容易遵循这个教导的。因为关于掌握“用”字的问题，最根本的问题在于“斗私，批修”。除非我们同“私”字的每一种表现进行坚持不懈的和继续不断的斗争，否则是不可能击败修正主义的。
    文章说：“我们讲改造自己，就是说要清除资产阶级思想，努力吸取坚定的无产阶级思想。标准是什么呢？不是一个人怎么说的，而是他怎么做的。”
    文章强调说：“资产阶级是决不会甘心情愿地放弃自己的统治阶级地位的，必须把它推翻。同样，统治阶级的基本意识形态也决不会放弃自己的统治地位，除非把它推翻。”
    文章说：“共产党员的无产阶级世界观只能表现在全心全意和毫不动摇地为工人阶级和它的党的事业上。而如果不是向我们周围压迫着我们的资产阶级的思想发动经常的和自觉的进攻，就不能够做到这一点，或者做到了也不能够基本上保持这一点。”
    文章指出：“‘老三篇’正是发动这种进攻的最好的武器。谁如果愿意向‘私’字的一切表现进行这种自觉的和经常的进攻，他就必须真正地经常阅读‘老三篇’。”
    文章最后强调说，对“老三篇”的态度，“表明一个人是否理解毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义的全部含义”。
