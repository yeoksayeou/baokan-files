The South China Sea is surging with a warm tide, the red sun shines over the South Mountains, the banks of the Songjiang River echo with victory songs, and the highlands of Tibet dance with the East Wind. The sun shines on the mountains and rivers, and the whole country is red.

The "January Revolution" has unleashed a storm. Chairman Mao leads us in the struggle for power. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, holding high the red flag, take the lead. They brave the winds and waves, and welcome the red tide sweeping the country.

We have taken the first step on the Long March, ready to march ten thousand miles. With guns in hand and red flags flying, we will create new achievements for the people. Following the great leader Chairman Mao, we will ensure that the red mountains and rivers remain red for ten thousand generations.

    欢呼全国山河一片红
    海军某部　杨　渡南海欢腾热潮涌，天山南北红彤彤，松江两岸凯歌传，西藏高原舞东风，阳光照山河，全国一片红。“一月革命”掀风暴，毛主席领导我们进行夺权斗争，无产阶级革命派，高举红旗打先锋，顶逆风，战恶浪，迎来了祖国山河一片红。长征迈开第一步，万里行军待出征，枪在手，战旗红，我们要为人民立新功。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，让红色江山万代红。
