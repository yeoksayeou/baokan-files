In the midst of the great situation where the whole country is red and the working class has taken the stage of the struggle-criticize-transform in the superstructure, we are filled with the spirit of victory and celebrate the first anniversary of our great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China.

Chairman Mao's personal inspection of the three major regions is the most brilliant chapter in the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. The series of extremely important instructions given by Chairman Mao during the inspection are the great program for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Looking back at the past year's battle course, the revolutionary changes that have taken place under the guidance of Chairman Mao's instructions are indeed tremendous! The great principles of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination proposed by Chairman Mao have been universally realized. The great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" proposed by Chairman Mao has achieved tremendous results. The great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" proposed by Chairman Mao has become the conscious action of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The great instruction to "hold study classes" proposed by Chairman Mao has become the fundamental way to solve various problems and complete various tasks. The brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully demonstrate the powerful revolutionary force of Chairman Mao's instructions.

The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions means the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To turn the Party's line into the line of the masses, we must make long-term, unyielding, arduous, and patient efforts. Without such efforts, nothing will succeed."

The military and civilian people of the whole country have made great efforts to implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. However, to complete the great task of struggle-criticize-transform and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every region, every department, and every unit must further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Due to various objective and subjective factors, the appearance of differences between advanced and backward elements is not surprising. Thorough materialists must acknowledge these differences, fully mobilize subjective initiative, discover contradictions, solve contradictions, and promote the Cultural Revolution to a higher level.

All regions, all departments, and all units must compare their work with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, check and summarize their work, what has been done, what has not been done, what has been done well, and what has not been done well, and promote achievements and overcome shortcomings. The advanced must become more advanced, and the backward must catch up with the advanced. By learning from each other and helping each other, a new situation of comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions will definitely emerge.

The key to comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions lies in further mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the revolutionary practice of the masses, and respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses. "When the masses are united, everything becomes easy." If the masses are not fully mobilized, if all positive factors are not mobilized, and if all forces that can be united are not united, the deep and great revolution of struggle-criticize-transform cannot be completed. This requires us to do more in-depth, more detailed, and more arduous ideological and political work among the masses. Through holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we should carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, criticize and overcome bourgeois thoughts such as anarchism, individualism, and factionalism, and raise the proletarian awareness of the broad revolutionary masses and the consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In whatever work we do, we Communists must adopt two methods: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of leadership and the masses." The leading members of revolutionary committees at all levels should learn from Chairman Mao's great practice, respond to Chairman Mao's great call, personally select some points, organize some people, and do a good job in investigation and research, combining Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the specific circumstances of the locality and the department. They should be good at discovering typical examples, setting up models, and using the experience of advanced units to educate and inspire the masses. They should be determined and put in effort to "stir up the hornet's nest" and solve "old and difficult" problems. By grasping both ends and bringing the middle along, the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in various units will definitely be promoted faster and better.

The full play of the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, and the entry of the propaganda teams composed of the working class and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army into various fields of the superstructure, will be able to better guarantee the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses should consciously accept the leadership of the working class, learn from the working class, learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen the proletarian concept of the whole and organizational discipline, and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to unify understanding, unify steps, and unify actions. The working class and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army should strive to learn in the struggle, play a model role, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and strictly implement Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies.

The closer the Cultural Revolution is to a comprehensive victory, the more the class enemies will try to sabotage the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the face of the victorious situation, we must not be complacent and relaxed, and we must not forget class struggle. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and expose and smash the interference and sabotage from the class enemies from the right and "left" at any time.

As long as we persistently implement Chairman Mao's instructions, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the tasks of struggle-criticize-transform will definitely be completed, and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely be accelerated.

    落实毛主席的指示就是胜利
    ——庆祝毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区一周年
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论
    在全国山河一片红，工人阶级登上上层建筑斗、批、改舞台的大好形势下，我们满怀胜利的豪情，庆祝我们伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区一周年。
    毛主席亲自视察三大地区，是我国无产阶级文化大革命历史上最光辉的篇章。毛主席在视察过程中所作的一系列极为重要的指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大纲领。
    回顾一年来的战斗历程，在毛主席指示的指引下发生的革命变化，是何等的巨大啊！毛主席提出的革命大联合和革命三结合的伟大原则，普遍地得到实现。毛主席提出的抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的伟大方针，取得了巨大成果。毛主席提出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，变成了亿万革命群众的自觉行动。毛主席提出的要办学习班的伟大指示，已成为解决各种问题、完成各项任务的根本途径。无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，充分显示了毛主席指示的强大革命威力。
    毛主席指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“把党的方针变为群众的方针，还须要我们长期坚持的、百折不挠的、艰苦卓绝的、耐心而不怕麻烦的努力。没有这样一种努力是一切都不成功的。”
    全国军民为落实毛主席一系列最新指示作了很大的努力。但是，要完成斗、批、改的伟大任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，每一个地区，每一个部门，每一个单位，都有一个进一步全面落实毛主席最新指示的问题。
    由于客观的主观的种种因素，出现先进和后进的差别，这是不奇怪的。彻底的唯物主义者，要承认这种差别，要充分发挥主观能动性，去发现矛盾，解决矛盾，推动文化大革命向更高的水平发展。
    一切地区，一切部门，一切单位，都要对照毛主席的最新指示，检查、总结自己的工作，那些做了，那些还没有做，那些做得好，那些做得不够，发扬成绩，克服缺点。先进的更先进，后进的赶先进，比学赶帮，就一定会出现一个全面落实毛主席最新指示的新局面。
    全面落实毛主席最新指示的关键，在于进一步动员群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的革命实践，尊重群众的首创精神。“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”如果不充分发动群众，不调动一切积极因素，不团结一切可以团结的力量，就不能完成斗、批、改这场深刻的伟大的革命。这就要求我们在群众中进行更深入、更细致、更艰巨的思想政治工作。要通过举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬理论联系实际的革命好学风，斗私批修，批判和克服无政府主义、个人主义、山头主义等等资产阶级思想，提高广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟，提高落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”各级革命委员会的领导成员，要学习毛主席的伟大实践，响应毛主席的伟大号召，亲自选择一些点，组织一些人，作好调查研究工作，把毛主席的最新指示同本地的、本部门的具体情况结合起来。要善于发现典型，树立样板，运用先进单位的经验教育群众，鼓舞群众。要下决心，下力量，捅“马蜂窝”，解决“老大难”问题。通过抓两头，带中间，必将推动各个单位更快更好地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用的充分发挥，工人群众和解放军战士组成的毛泽东思想宣传队开进上层建筑各个领域，这就能够更有力地保证毛主席最新指示的全面落实。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要自觉地接受工人阶级领导，向工人阶级学习，向人民解放军学习，加强无产阶级的整体观念和组织纪律性，用毛主席的最新指示来统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。工人群众和解放军战士要在斗争中努力学习，发挥模范作用，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，严格执行毛主席的各项无产阶级政策。
    文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要破坏毛主席最新指示的全面落实。在胜利的形势下，我们千万不要麻痹松懈，不要忘记阶级斗争，要保持高度的革命警惕，随时揭露和粉碎来自阶级敌人右的和“左”的方面的干扰和破坏。
    只要我们坚持不懈地落实毛主席的指示，紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，斗、批、改的任务就一定能够完成，无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利就一定能加速到来。
