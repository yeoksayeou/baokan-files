The train of the people has become a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a battlefield for carrying out the great criticism. For more than two years, the 4720 unit has been responsible for the security of passenger trains from Beijing to various parts of the country. They have taken class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the trains, organizing revolutionary masses from all over the country to carry out in-depth criticism, turning the trains into a position for fiercely attacking China's Khrushchev. This has been highly praised by the broad revolutionary masses. The following is a group of articles written by soldiers of the 4720 unit about the criticism on the trains.

The Working Class is the Master of the Educational Revolution

The 79th train car was filled with a heated atmosphere as the criticism of the bourgeois educational line was underway.

An old worker from the Xi'an Machinery Factory excitedly said: We must transform the schools into a stronghold serving the proletariat. In the past, the "scholars" trained by the universities have created many farcical situations where theory is separated from practice. Our factory has three university graduates who studied a machine for three years but failed to produce any results. During the Cultural Revolution, a technician of worker origin and old workers worked together for three months and successfully developed the advanced large machine urgently needed by our factory. Isn't it clear which path school education should take?

At this moment, a university student from Zhengzhou couldn't sit still any longer. He said to everyone: China's Khrushchev's bourgeois educational line only tells us to "specialize in our field" and "learn technology," but when we enter the factory, we can't operate the machines. Fortunately, an old worker taught me, and in less than ten minutes, I learned how to do it. The facts have made me fully realize that only when the working class participates in all aspects of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the schools can the proletarian educational revolution be carried out to the end.

Before this student could finish speaking, an old peasant next to him stood up and said: Chairman Mao said that the working class should lead the educational revolution, which truly speaks to our hearts. Take my eldest son, for example. He studied for twelve years, but last year when he returned home, he couldn't push a plow or carry a load. If this continues, he will completely forget the essence of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao said that the working class should forever lead the schools, which is a thousand times good, ten thousand times good. Only in this way can we be at ease when our children enter school.

We Will Never Take the Road of Capitalist Restoration

On a certain train from Beijing to Inner Mongolia, the on-duty soldiers hung cartoons of China's Khrushchev advocating "three freedoms and one contract" all over the car, organizing passengers to criticize China's Khrushchev for destroying the people's communes and forcing the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the wrong path.

An old woman in her sixties stood up with tears in her eyes, pointing at the cartoon and angrily said: Today, I finally see through this big villain. In 1962, it was he who spread the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract" in the countryside. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our village followed suit, shouting for the distribution of land to households and undermining the foundations of socialism. We poor and lower-middle peasants proposed that whoever distributes land and leads cows is destroying socialism. Fortunately, Chairman Mao led us to resist this evil wind, which is why our brigade has had a bumper harvest every year and has always been a surplus grain brigade. In the old society, the landlord killed three members of my family, forcing me to drag my four-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son to beg for food everywhere. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's rescue, how could I have this family? Chairman Mao saved us poor people from the fire pit, organized us to take the path of collectivization, established people's communes, and made our lives better day by day. China's Khrushchev wants to promote "three freedoms and one contract," forcing us to return to a society where people eat each other. Tell him, as long as we poor and lower-middle peasants are here, he can't realize this dream.

At this moment, a member from Inner Mongolia walked to the center of the meeting, clenched his fists, and said: China's Khrushchev regards the people's communes as a thorn in the eye and a splinter in the flesh, shouting that socialism is moving too fast. What nonsense is this? I say that the faster socialism moves, the better. In 1962, our brigade had two landlords who saw the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" blown by China's Khrushchev and thought there was an opportunity. They spread rumors that the commune with many people couldn't do well, and distributing land to households could make people rich. We firmly refuted these lies. We poor and lower-middle peasants know best: Only the people's communes and socialism are our reliance. We will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

Advancing Along the Path of Combining with Workers and Peasants

A certain express train heading to Northeast China was filled with capital students going to the countryside. The Red Guards, each holding a red book of revolution, were full of revolutionary enthusiasm to combine with the workers and peasants, criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line in the car.

They said: Chairman Mao pointed out: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." However, China's Khrushchev told us to only think about reading books and becoming officials as soon as we enter school, aiming to become famous and establish a family. Those who have studied in such schools for more than ten years do not know how workers make the clothes they wear or how poor and lower-middle peasants grow the grain they eat.

They said: China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line not only makes us detached from the workers and peasants and productive practice but, more importantly, detaches us from proletarian politics. Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out to us: "You should care about state affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!" China's Khrushchev, however, wants us to "hear nothing outside the window and concentrate on reading the classics." This is to prevent us from making a revolution and to try to lead us onto the path of being experts without redness. We will not be fooled.

They said: Among countless crimes, the fundamental crime of the revisionist educational line is to cultivate successors who are detached from workers and peasants and the three great revolutionary practices. China's Khrushchev attempts to turn the younger generation into the inheritors of the bourgeoisie, changing the color of our socialist motherland. This is absolutely impossible. We will forever walk the path of combining with workers and peasants!

The Mention of Exploitation Makes Us Grind Our Teeth in Hatred

In the car of a certain express train from Beijing to Chengdu, a battle was underway, launching a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is meritorious."

A worker from Jilin, unable to suppress his anger, said indignantly: We Jilin miners heard China's Khrushchev absurdly say that capitalists "exploit with merit" and "workers like to be exploited," which made us so angry that our eyes were on fire and our lungs were about to explode. We wanted to cut him into a thousand pieces and a million pieces. Before liberation, my father worked to death for the capitalist, mining coal for a year, but when the accounts were settled, he still owed the capitalist money. Where did my father get the money? He was beaten to death by the running dogs with a steel whip. This is not all; they also burned down our small, leaky grass house, took my nine-year-old sister to offset the debt, and took me to mine coal. Do we workers like this dark and miserable life of exploitation? No, a million times no! The mention of exploitation makes us grind our teeth in hatred!

A blind old peasant woman in her sixties, hearing the worker brother's accusation and criticism, shed tears of joy and sorrow. She also accused the miserable experiences in the old society, talked about the happy life under Chairman Mao's wise leadership after liberation, and finally said excitedly: China's Khrushchev absurdly says that workers and peasants like exploitation and that exploitation is meritorious, which is a plot to restore capitalism and make us suffer again. I will risk this old life to fight China's Khrushchev to the end!

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    四海翻腾云水怒　五洲震荡风雷激
    编者的话：人民列车已经成了活学活用毛主席著作的课堂和革命大批判的战场。两年多来，四七二○部队担负着从北京通向祖国各地的旅客列车的值勤任务。他们以阶级斗争和路线斗争为纲，在列车上大力宣传伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，组织五湖四海的革命群众深入开展革命大批判，把列车当作向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火的阵地，受到了广大革命群众的好评。这里发表的一组文章，就是四七二○部队战士们所写的列车大批判的纪实。
    工人阶级是教育革命的主人
    七十九次列车的车厢里热气腾腾，正在批判资产阶级教育路线。
    一位西安机械厂的老工人激动地说：我们一定要把学校改造成为无产阶级服务的阵地。过去大学里培养出来的“秀才”，理论脱离实践的笑话可是闹得不少。我们工厂就有三个大学生，研究一部机床，三年没有研究出来。文化大革命中，工人出身的技术员和老工人合作奋战三个月，就研究出我厂急需的一部高级大型机床。大家看，学校教育该走什么道路，不是明摆着的吗？
    这时，一个郑州的大学生坐不住了。他对大家说：中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级教育路线尽叫我们“钻业务”，“学技术”，走进工厂却开不了机器。多亏一位老工人教我，不到十分钟就学会了。事实使我充分认识到只有工人阶级参加学校的全部斗、批、改，才能把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
  还没等这个学生说完，旁边一位贫农老大爷站起来说：毛主席叫工人阶级领导教育革命，真是说到我们的心坎里了。就拿我的大儿子说吧，他上了十二年学，去年回家，我让他到地里干活，他推不会推，挑不会挑。这样下去，真是把贫下中农的本色都要忘光啦。毛主席叫工人阶级永远领导学校，一千个好，一万个好，只有这样，孩子们进了学校，我们才放心。
    决不走复辟资本主义的黑路
    在由北京开往内蒙古的某次列车上，值勤战士把中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”的漫画挂满车厢，组织旅客大批中国赫鲁晓夫破坏人民公社，让贫下中农走回头路的罪行。
    一位六十多岁的老大娘，满眼泪花站起来，指着漫画愤怒地说：今天我算看透了这个大坏蛋。一九六二年就是他在农村大刮“三自一包”的妖风，俺村的地、富、反、坏、右就跟着叫嚷分田到户，挖社会主义的墙脚。俺贫下中农提出谁分田、谁牵牛，谁就是破坏社会主义。多亏毛主席他老人家指挥我们顶住了这股妖风，这才使我们队年年丰收，年年是余粮队。在旧社会，地主害死我家三口人，逼得我拖着四岁的闺女，八岁的儿子，到处讨饭。要不是毛主席搭救，那有我这一家。毛主席把咱们穷人从火坑里救出来，组织我们走集体化道路，成立了人民公社，日子一天比一天好。中国赫鲁晓夫倒要大搞“三自一包”，叫咱们再退回到人吃人的社会。告诉他，有咱贫下中农在，他就别想做这个美梦。
    这时，一位内蒙古社员，走到会场中间，紧握拳头说：中国赫鲁晓夫把人民公社看成眼中钉，肉中刺，叫嚷社会主义走得太快了。这是什么话？我说社会主义越快越好。一九六二年我们队有两个地主，他们看到中国赫鲁晓夫刮“三自一包”黑风，觉得有机可乘，散布什么公社人多搞不好，土地到户能富裕。我们坚决驳斥这些鬼话。我们贫下中农最懂得：只有人民公社、社会主义才是我们的靠山。毛主席指引的路我们走定了！
    沿着与工农结合的大道前进
    开往东北去的某次直快客车里坐满了上山下乡的首都学生。红卫兵小将个个手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，满怀与工农群众相结合的革命豪情，在车厢里批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。
    他们说：毛主席指出：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”可是中国赫鲁晓夫却叫我们一进校门就只想读书当官，成名成家。在那样的学校里读过十几年书的人，就不知道穿的衣服是工人阶级怎样做成的，吃的粮食是贫下中农怎样种出来的。
    他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线不但使我们脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践，更重要的是脱离无产阶级政治。伟大领袖毛主席向我们指出：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”中国赫鲁晓夫却要我们“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”。这就是不叫我们搞革命，妄想把我们拉上白专道路。我们决不上当。
    他们说：千条罪，万条罪，修正主义教育路线的根本大罪就是培养脱离工农、脱离三大革命实践的修正主义接班人。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把青年一代演变成为资产阶级的继承人，让社会主义祖国改变颜色，这一万个办不到。我们永远走与工农相结合的道路！
    提起剥削恨得牙根疼
    从北京开往成都的特快列车的车厢里，正在进行一场战斗，向中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论猛烈开火。
    一位吉林的工人，压不住心头怒火，愤恨地说：我们吉林矿工，一听到中国赫鲁晓夫胡说资本家“剥削有功”，“工人喜欢剥削”，气得眼里冒火、肺就要炸，恨不得千刀万剐了他。解放前，我父亲给资本家拚死拚活挖煤，干了一年，一算账倒该资本家的钱。父亲哪里来的钱，就被狗腿子一顿钢鞭活活打死了。这还不算，又把我家一间不遮天的小破草屋给烧掉，把我一个九岁的妹妹拉去抵债，把我抓去挖煤。难道我们工人喜欢这种暗无天日的悲惨生活吗？不，一万个不，提起剥削，我们只有恨得牙根疼！
    一位六十多岁、双目失明的贫农老大娘，听了工人兄弟的控诉和批判，流下了悲喜交集的眼泪。她也控诉了在旧社会的悲惨遭遇，大讲了解放后在毛主席英明领导下的幸福生活，最后激动地说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说工人农民喜欢剥削，剥削有功，就是妄想复辟资本主义、让我们再去受苦受罪。我豁出这条老命也要和中国赫鲁晓夫拚到底！
