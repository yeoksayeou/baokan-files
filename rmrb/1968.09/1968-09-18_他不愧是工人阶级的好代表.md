He Truly is a Good Representative of the Working Class

Sun Zhaoliang
Old Worker in the Coal Mining Team of Heishan Coal Mine, Zibo City, Shandong Province

Our revolutionary committee's standing committee member, Qi Xiu'en, used to be a worker in our team. When he first went to the revolutionary committee, I was a bit worried. I thought: Qi Xiu'en is a hardworking laborer. In the team, he is the most trusted person. Everyone likes to talk to him and share their thoughts. They ask him for help in studying Chairman Mao's works and improving their ideological awareness. Everyone praises him for his good connections with the masses and his love for labor. Now that Qi Xiu'en has become a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee and is working in the office, will he lose his good habits from before? If he does, this power will not be wielded well!

Facts have educated me. Qi Xiu'en truly is a good representative of the working class. Not only has he not changed, but he has also become even more connected with the masses and more active in labor. His responsibilities in the mine are heavy, and his work is busy, but he often "returns home" every few days. He studies and applies Chairman Mao's works with the team members, criticizes the Chinese Khrushchev, fights against class enemies, and has heart-to-heart talks. In the sharing meetings, he, as always, takes the lead in exposing his own shortcomings. What is even more admirable is that he still often goes down the coal mine with us and operates the large drilling machine. Where it is most tiring, he goes there; where it is most dangerous, he rushes there. In the battle to achieve high coal production, Qi Xiu'en developed sores on his body, could not sleep, and could not lie down. He endured it silently and insisted on working continuously for three days in the most cramped and tiring work area. During the labor, he constantly sang the words, "Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After three days, Qi Xiu'en's eyes were red from exhaustion, and he had become thinner. When everyone found out that Qi Xiu'en had been working while sick, they were all moved.

For a few days, Qi Xiu'en did not come to the team. Later, he came to work in the mine again. As soon as I saw him, I said, "Qi Xiu'en, have the calluses on your hands fallen off?" Hearing this, Qi Xiu'en immediately criticized himself for going down the mine less. After work, Qi Xiu'en, together with everyone, held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people, and we do everything for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" Then, he examined himself in front of everyone for not being connected enough with the masses and not participating in labor enough. He exposed his shortcomings sincerely and asked everyone to criticize him, which educated us greatly. Later, I found out that during these days, Qi Xiu'en did not come to our team because he was dealing with class struggles at another site. Since then, Qi Xiu'en not only often participates in labor but also sets five rules for himself to connect with the masses: not leaving without studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the masses; not leaving without fighting against private and revisionist thoughts with everyone; not leaving without participating in labor; not leaving without having heart-to-heart talks with workers individually; not leaving without listening to the masses' criticisms. Now, whenever he is mentioned, the workers always give a thumbs up and proudly say, "Old Qi is still with us, he is one of us in the working class."

    他不愧是工人阶级的好代表
    山东省淄博市黑山煤矿采煤老工人　孙兆亮
    俺矿革委会的常委齐秀恩，原来是俺班的工人。他刚去革委会那阵子，俺可有点不放心。俺想：秀恩是个劳动好手，在班里是大伙最贴心的人，谁有心里话都愿意当他的面说，有事愿意跟他谈，请他帮助学习毛主席著作，提高思想觉悟。大伙都夸他联系群众好，热爱劳动。如今秀恩当了革委会常委，蹲机关了，会不会把过去的好作风丢了。要是丢了，这个权可掌不好啊！
    事实教育了我，秀恩不愧是工人阶级的好代表。他不但没有变，联系群众比过去更密切了，参加劳动更积极了。他在矿上担子重，工作忙，还三天两头“回娘家”，和班里的同志们一块活学活用毛主席著作，一块批判中国赫鲁晓夫，一块斗争阶级敌人，一块促膝谈心。在讲用会上，他和以往一样，带头亮私斗私。更叫人佩服的是，他还和过去一样，经常和我们一块钻煤井，甩大铣。那里最累，他往那里去，那里危险，他往那里冲。在夺取煤炭高产的战斗中，秀恩身上长了疮，不能睡，不能躺。他一声不吭，到一个最矮最累的作业面上连续坚持劳动三天。在劳动中，他不断高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌。三天结束了，秀恩眼睛熬得通红，人也变瘦了。当大伙知道秀恩带病坚持劳动时，都很感动。
    有几天，秀恩没到班上来。后来，他又到井下劳动来了。一见面，我说：“秀恩，手上的茧子脱了吧。”听到这话，秀恩马上检讨自己下井少了。下班后，秀恩和大伙一块手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，背诵毛主席他老人家的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”接着，他当着大伙检查了自己联系群众不够，参加劳动不多的缺点，亮私斗私，诚恳地请大伙批评，对大伙教育很大。后来我才知道，这几天秀恩没有到俺班去，是到另外一个点上抓阶级斗争去了。打那以后，秀恩不但常参加劳动，而且给自己规定了联系群众“五不走”：不和群众一块活学活用毛主席著作不走；不和大家一块斗私批修不走；不参加劳动不走；不和工人个别谈心不走；不听取群众批评不走。现在每逢提起他，工人们总是竖起大拇指自豪地说：“老齐还是和我们一条心，是咱工人阶级这条线上的人。”
