After American black masses launched a wave of armed resistance against violence that swept across more than a hundred cities in April this year, they continued their struggle in Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, Los Angeles, and dozens of other cities this summer. They bravely fought, killing and injuring a large number of fascist police, dealing a heavy blow to the American reactionary ruling class.

The struggle launched by American black masses this summer is taking place under the conditions where the American reactionary ruling class is using two counter-revolutionary tactics to intensify the suppression of black armed resistance. Since April this year, the American reactionaries have not only expanded the police force, conducted so-called "riot control" training for the "National Guard" and regular army, but also established a "special command center" within the Pentagon to command these troops. They adopted the tactic of "immediately deploying all police as soon as the first sign of trouble is detected, and quickly supporting them with state police, National Guard, and the U.S. Army." On the other hand, they have intensified their deceptive tactics, using empty promises and minor favors to deceive the black masses, and have intensified their efforts to buy off and win over certain "influential figures" among the blacks to use them to sabotage the black struggle. The mouthpiece of the American monopoly capitalist class, *U.S. News & World Report*, boasted in mid-July, "Future riots will not be as large and widespread as before." However, the continuous armed resistance against violence by American blacks this summer has given the American reactionary ruling class a resounding slap in the face.

One characteristic of the American black resistance against violence this summer is that more and more blacks are taking up arms, using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. Under the intensified suppression by the American reactionary ruling class, blacks have adopted a strategy of resolute resistance. On July 23, blacks in Cleveland took up short guns, automatic rifles, and machine guns, delivering a heavy blow to the fascist police who attacked them, killing three police officers and injuring more than ten. On August 11, blacks in the Watts district of Los Angeles, with its glorious tradition, surrounded the police station in the Watts district during a gun battle with fascist police. According to reports, blacks fired at least a thousand bullets at this police station, eventually forcing the police to retreat in disarray. In many other cities' resistance against violence, in addition to using stones and Molotov cocktails as weapons, more and more blacks are taking up various firearms, shooting at police and police cars, dealing a heavy blow to the fascist police.

The black armed resistance against violence has received widespread support from American blacks. Many black soldiers in Vietnam have found ways to send weapons to their relatives in the U.S. to use against the fascist police. Many black veterans have also directly participated in the armed resistance against violence in places like Cleveland. Recently, the mother of a black youth, Taylor, who sacrificed his life in the armed resistance against violence in Cleveland, said in an interview that she had repeatedly educated her son to raise his consciousness. Now that her son had sacrificed his life for the cause of black liberation, she felt proud. Taylor's wife also expressed her pride in having such a brave husband and said she would educate her children to fight and live like their father. The voices of these ordinary American black women fully demonstrate the spirit of American blacks fighting for freedom and liberation, fearing no sacrifice, and fighting unyieldingly.

The armed resistance against violence by American blacks this summer has also proven that the American reactionary ruling class can buy off and win over some traitors among the blacks, but they cannot deceive the black masses in America. The American reactionary ruling class has installed some of their lackeys in black-majority cities to act as mayors, attempting to sabotage the black armed resistance against violence from within. In Cleveland, despite the black mayor Stokes' efforts to run errands for the American reactionary ruling class during the black armed resistance against violence, constantly calling for blacks to "cooperate with the police" and "stay at home and lock the doors," and organizing some black "community leaders" to replace the police in patrolling the black areas, the black masses completely ignored him and continued to take to the streets in large numbers to actively participate in the armed resistance against violence.

The new wave of armed resistance against violence launched by American blacks this summer shows that American blacks cannot be suppressed or deceived. They are growing stronger in the struggle and will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement to ultimately end the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class.

### 拿起枪杆抗暴　前赴后继战斗　不上当局圈套  美国黑人夏季抗暴斗争沉重打击反动统治

    拿起枪杆抗暴　前赴后继战斗　不上当局圈套
    美国黑人夏季抗暴斗争沉重打击反动统治
    新华社三十一日讯　美国黑人群众在今年四月掀起了一个席卷美国一百几十个城镇的武力抗暴斗争之后，今年夏天又继续在克利夫兰、芝加哥、底特律、迈阿密、洛杉矶等几十个城市展开了英勇的斗争，打死打伤大批法西斯警察，给了美国反动统治集团以重大的打击。
    美国黑人群众今年夏天掀起的这场斗争，是在美国反动统治集团使用反革命两手，加紧镇压黑人武力抗暴斗争的情况下进行的。自今年四月以来，美国反动派不仅大力扩充警察，对“国民警卫队”和正规军进行所谓“防暴”训练，而且还在五角大楼内建立了指挥这些部队的“特别指挥中心”，采用了所谓“发现麻烦的第一个信号时就立即把全部警察投入行动，并迅速用州警察、国民警卫队和美国陆军来加以支持”的办法；另一方面，它又加紧使用欺骗手法，利用空头支票和小恩小惠来欺骗黑人群众，并加紧收买、拉拢黑人中的某些“头面人物”，利用他们来破坏黑人的斗争。美国垄断资产阶级的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》七月中旬洋洋得意地宣称，“未来的暴乱将不会象以前那样大和那样广泛了”。可是今年夏天连续不断的美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争，给了美国反动统治集团一记响亮的耳光。
    今年夏天美国黑人抗暴斗争的一个特点是越来越多的黑人拿起枪杆子，以革命的暴力对付反革命的暴力。在美国反动统治集团对黑人加紧镇压的情况下，黑人们采取了针锋相对，坚决抵抗的对策。七月二十三日，克利夫兰市的黑人拿起短枪、自动步枪和机关枪，对来犯的法西斯警察予以狠狠的打击，当场打死警察三名，打伤十余名。八月十一日，具有光荣传统的洛杉矶市瓦茨区的黑人在同法西斯警察的枪战中，包围了瓦茨区的警察分局，据报道，黑人击中这个警察分局的枪弹至少达一千发以上，并最后迫使警察狼狈万状地撤出了这个分局。在其他许多城市的抗暴斗争中，黑人们除了使用石块、燃烧瓶等作为武器外，也有越来越多的黑人拿起各种枪支，射击警察、警车，给法西斯警察以沉重打击。
    黑人的武力抗暴斗争受到美国黑人的广泛拥护和支持，许多侵越美军中的黑人士兵，想方设法把武器寄给美国的亲友，让他们用来打击法西斯警察。许多黑人退伍士兵还直接参加了克利夫兰等地黑人的武力抗暴斗争。最近，在克利夫兰武力抗暴斗争中壮烈牺牲了的黑人青年泰勒的母亲在一次谈话中说，她曾不断教育她的儿子，提高他的觉悟，现在她儿子为了黑人的解放事业而牺牲了，她感到自豪。泰勒的妻子也表示她因有这样英勇的丈夫而自豪，她要教育她的孩子象他父亲那样战斗和生活。这些美国普通黑人妇女的心声，充分显示了美国黑人争取自由、解放，不怕牺牲，前赴后继的战斗精神。
    今年夏天美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争还充分证明，美国反动统治集团可以拉拢、收买一些黑人中的叛徒，但是欺骗不了美国的黑人群众。美国反动统治集团曾在一些黑人占多数的城市里，安插了一些他们在黑人中的走狗充当市长，妄图从中破坏黑人武力抗暴斗争。在克利夫兰市，尽管黑人市长斯托克斯在克利夫兰黑人武力抗暴斗争期间，十分卖力地为美国反动统治集团奔走，不断叫嚷要黑人“和警察合作”，“呆在家里，把门锁上”，还组织什么黑人“民间领袖”代替警察在黑人区巡逻等等，但是，黑人群众一概不予理睬，仍然大批大批地拥上街头，积极参加武力抗暴斗争。
    今年夏天，美国黑人所掀起的新的武力抗暴斗争的怒潮，说明美国黑人是压不垮，骗不了的，他们正在战斗中不断地成长起来，并必将和美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。
