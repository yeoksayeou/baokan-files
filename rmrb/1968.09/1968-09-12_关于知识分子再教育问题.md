The establishment of revolutionary committees in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of the country (excluding Taiwan Province) marks the beginning of the nationwide stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the vast army of industrial workers is already and will continue to enter schools, various sectors of the superstructure, and all units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not yet been fully carried out, in an organized and step-by-step manner, to promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation there. This not only opens up a new situation for the proletarian educational revolution but will also accelerate the process of the Chinese working class transforming the ranks of intellectuals in its own image.

The working class entering the cultural and educational front means that the main objects of work are intellectuals. Correctly grasping the Party's policy towards intellectuals is a crucial guarantee for victory in the struggle.

The September 5th issue of the newspaper published an important editorial note from the *Red Flag* magazine, which is the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao. This editorial note raises a very important issue: it is necessary to pay attention to the re-education of a large number of graduates from colleges and secondary schools who have been working or are currently working. The editorial note outlines the various proletarian policies towards intellectuals and further points out the only correct direction for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that in the entire process of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the transformation of intellectuals is a major issue. After the proletariat seizes political power, it must transform intellectuals in its own image and build a corps of proletarian intellectuals to serve itself. This is necessary for consolidating and developing the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and establishing complete proletarian rule in the ideological and cultural spheres. To build such a corps of proletarian intellectuals, it is necessary to carry out a thorough proletarian educational revolution, to take the revolutionary road of cultivating technical personnel and other intellectuals from among workers, peasants, and soldiers; at the same time, it is also necessary to re-educate a large number of intellectuals who have graduated from old schools, to win over and unite with the broad masses of intellectuals. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens and enters the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the importance of solving this problem becomes increasingly clear.

The editorial note points out: "Attention should be paid to the re-education of a large number of graduates from colleges and secondary schools who have been working or are currently working." This not only involves schools but also the broad masses of intellectuals on our cultural and educational front and in the ranks of cadres. Why is it called re-education? Because in the past, they received bourgeois education, and now they are receiving proletarian education again; this is one meaning. Another meaning is that in the past, they received education under the poisonous influence of the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, while now, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they are receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The transformation of worldview is the fundamental transformation. Educating intellectuals with the proletarian worldview, making them change the bourgeois ideology they received from bourgeois education, this is the content of re-education. Integrating with workers and peasants and serving them is the fundamental way of re-education.

In carrying out re-education, it is necessary to fully bring out the positive factors. The line is the fundamental issue; what line cultivates what kind of people. We should focus our hatred on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents, as it is their counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line that has poisoned the youth. In the process of thoroughly criticizing this reactionary line, we can further promote the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, in socialist New China, the majority or a large majority of students cultivated in old schools can gradually integrate with workers and peasants, although there will be vacillation and backsliding. As long as they follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, accept re-education from workers and peasants, thoroughly criticize and constantly change the bourgeois old ideas they brought from their families and schools, they can make contributions in serving workers and peasants. Workers and peasants welcome such intellectuals. There are a few counter-revolutionaries and diehards, but they are in the extreme minority. The broad masses of intellectuals who are willing to accept transformation under the leadership of the working class and willing to integrate with workers and peasants have a bright future in the socialist system. The editorial note points out: "Among them, there must be those who integrate well and have inventions and creations, and they should be reported to encourage others." This is to encourage and promote the broad masses of intellectuals to firmly take the road of integrating with workers and peasants. There are those who integrate well and have inventions and creations in various places, and their examples should be used to educate intellectuals who have already or are about to enter the workforce.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up even broader avenues for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants, to transform their worldview, and to better serve the people. The broad masses of intellectuals have undergone tremendous tempering and testing in the Cultural Revolution, deeply feeling the shortcomings of their own revolutionary incompleteness and vacillation, and urgently demanding integration with workers and peasants. This is a very encouraging phenomenon. Revolutionary committees throughout the country and the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in relevant units should be good at discovering their enthusiasm, supporting their integration with workers and peasants, and guiding them to actively participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. In the future, in places where intellectuals are concentrated, not only should the struggle, criticism, and transformation be carried out under the leadership of the working class, and various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes be organized, but they should also be organized in batches to go to workers and peasants to receive re-education from them.

We must provide a way out. "A policy that does not provide a way out is not a proletarian policy." The proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all humanity. The proletarian policy should point out the way for the people of all classes and strata under the leadership of the proletariat and should, as far as possible, transform negative factors into positive ones. Adopting such a policy will be more conducive to promoting those who have made serious mistakes to confess and correct their mistakes. For the extremely few who are deeply hated by the people and need to be overthrown, such as so-called diehard capitalist roaders and bourgeois authorities, after thorough criticism, a way out should also be provided. This is an issue that must be paid attention to in the later period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We must resolutely implement the various proletarian policies regarding intellectuals as stipulated by the great leader Chairman Mao. We must distinguish between two types of contradictions. For contradictions among the people, we must adopt the method of unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity to handle them, and for ideological issues, we must use facts, reason, and patient and meticulous ideological and political work to solve them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is approaching its comprehensive victory, presenting a magnificent picture before the broad revolutionary masses. We believe that under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and under the leadership of the working class, the broad revolutionary and transformable intellectuals in our country will advance even faster on the road of revolutionization and laborization. We hope that the intellectuals of our country will continue to advance, gradually establish a communist worldview in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, gradually integrate with workers and peasants, and not stop halfway, let alone retreat, because retreat has no way out.

    关于知识分子再教育问题
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志评论员
    全国（除台湾省外）二十九个省、市、自治区普遍成立了革命委员会，标志着整个文化大革命运动已在全国范围内进入斗、批、改的阶段。在毛主席最新指示的指引下，浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军已经并正在有领导、有步骤地到学校去，到上层建筑各个领域中去，到一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位去，促进那里的斗、批、改。这不仅为无产阶级教育革命打开了崭新的局面，也必将加速我国工人阶级按照自己的面貌改造知识分子队伍的进程。
    工人阶级进入文化教育阵地，工作对象主要是知识分子。正确掌握党对知识分子的政策，就是取得斗争胜利的重要保证。
    九月五日报上发表的《红旗》杂志极其重要的编者按，是伟大领袖毛主席的声音。这个编者按，提出了一个十分重要的问题，就是要注意对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的知识分子，进行再教育。编者按中提出了对待知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，并且进一步指明了知识分子与工农相结合的唯一正确的方向。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说，在整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，对知识分子的改造是一个极大的问题。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，要按照自己的面貌来改造知识分子，建立起一支为自己服务的无产阶级知识分子队伍，这是巩固和发展无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟所必需的，是无产阶级在思想文化的各个领域内建立完全的统治地位所必需的。建立这样一支无产阶级知识分子队伍，必须实行彻底的无产阶级教育革命，走从工农兵中培养技术人员及其他知识分子的革命道路，从有生产实践经验的工人、农民和解放军战士中选拔学生；同时，还必须对大量从过去旧学校出来的知识分子进行再教育，争取和团结广大的知识分子。随着无产阶级文化大革命深入发展到斗、批、改的阶段，解决这个课题的重大意义就越来越清楚地显示在人们面前。
    编者按指出：“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育”。这不仅涉及学校，而且涉及我们文教战线及干部队伍中广大的知识分子。为什么叫再教育？因为过去接受的是资产阶级的教育，现在接受的是无产阶级再一次的教育，这是一层意思。还有一层意思：过去是在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线毒害下，受资产阶级知识分子教育，现在则是在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，由工农兵给他们以再教育。世界观的改造是根本的改造。用无产阶级世界观教育知识分子，使他们改变过去从资产阶级教育中接受的资产阶级思想，这就是再教育的内容。同工农兵结合，为工农兵服务，则是再教育的根本途径。
    进行再教育，要充分发扬积极因素。路线问题是根本问题，什么路线培养什么样的人。应当把仇恨集中在党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人身上，是他们的反革命修正主义教育路线毒害了青年。在彻底批判这条反动路线的过程中，就可以推动人们更进一步地去贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。在毛泽东思想教育下，在社会主义的新中国，多数或大多数从旧学校里培养出来的学生是能够逐步同工农兵结合的，其中必有动摇和反复，但只要他们能跟着毛主席无产阶级革命路线前进，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底批判并不断改变自己从家庭中、学校中带来的资产阶级旧思想，就能在为工农兵服务中作出贡献。对于这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。反革命分子、顽固派是有的，那是极少数。广大愿意在工人阶级领导下接受改造、愿意同工农兵结合的知识分子，他们在社会主义制度下有广阔的前途。编者按指出：“其中必有结合得好的并有所发明创造的，应予以报导，以资鼓励。”就是要从正面鼓励和促使广大知识分子坚定地走上同工农兵结合的道路。结合得好并又有创造发明的，各地都有，应当用他们的榜样来教育已经或正要走上工作岗位的知识分子。
    无产阶级文化大革命，为知识分子和工农兵相结合，改造世界观，更好地为人民服务，开辟了更加广阔的途径。广大知识分子在文化大革命中经受了巨大的锻炼和考验，痛切地感到了自己身上的革命不彻底性和动摇性的弱点，迫切地要求和工农兵结合，这是一种十分可喜的现象。全国各地的革命委员会和进驻有关单位的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，要善于发现他们的这种积极性，支持他们和工农兵相结合，引导他们积极投入本单位的斗、批、改。今后，在那些知识分子成堆的地方，不但要在工人阶级领导下，搞好本单位斗、批、改，办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，而且应该分期分批地组织他们到工农兵中去，接受工农兵的再教育。
    要给出路。“不给出路的政策，不是无产阶级的政策”。无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己，无产阶级的政策，要为在无产阶级领导下的各阶级、阶层的人民群众指明出路，并且尽可能地把消极因素转化为积极因素。采取这种政策，可以更有利于促进那些犯有严重错误的人交代和改正自己的错误。对于极少数民愤极大，需要打倒的所谓顽固不化的走资派和资产阶级技术权威，在充分批判之后，也要给出路。这是无产阶级文化大革命运动后期必须提起注意的一个问题。
    我们必须坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席所规定的关于知识分子的各项无产阶级政策。要分清两类不同性质的矛盾。对于人民内部矛盾，必须采取团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方法处理，对于思想问题，要采用摆事实、讲道理、做耐心细致的思想政治工作去解决。
    无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的大好形势，在广大的革命群众前头展现出一片壮丽的图景。我们相信，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在工人阶级的领导下，我国广大革命的和有可能改造的知识分子，在革命化、劳动化的道路上，一定会更快地前进。我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。
