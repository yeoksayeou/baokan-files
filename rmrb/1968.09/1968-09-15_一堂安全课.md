Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship."

A Safety Lesson

On a Monday safety class, a student casually said, "Safety class is nothing, it doesn't matter if we skip it." An old worker heard this and immediately said solemnly and seriously, "No, it's not nothing. Whether there is a safety class or not is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang!"

Later, this old worker, Wang Master, linked this incident to recount his bitter experiences in the old society to the students. Wang Master said, he was born in a poor peasant family in the countryside of Northeast China. At the age of seven, he started working for the landlord, always hungry and cold, and a little older, he was taken by the wicked Japanese and puppet regime to North Manchuria as a laborer. There, he suffered endless torment, eating only two bowls of thin porridge and two small mixed flour balls the size of cow's eyes every day, working hard all day, and if he was not careful, the whips of the Japanese and traitors would lash his body; if he fell ill, the light ones would go hungry, and the serious ones would be thrown into the ravine to feed the dogs. Most of the class brothers who went to North Manchuria lived like this. At that time, workers were not even considered animals in the eyes of the exploiting classes, let alone having safety classes. Only after liberation, under the leadership of our most respected great leader Chairman Mao, did the working class stand up and become the masters, and only then did safety classes begin. But the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders, on the contrary, vigorously advocated "material incentives" and "profit-oriented" management, urging workers to work for bonuses. They did not care about the safety of workers. Only Chairman Mao cares about workers the most. A safety class embodies Chairman Mao's deep affection for the working class and reflects the brilliance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. How can one say that safety classes are nothing?

A drop of water can reflect the brilliance of the sun, and a small incident reflects the deep class feelings of the working class for Chairman Mao, their unwavering loyalty to the socialist system, and their bitter hatred for the old society. The students said, "The advanced thoughts of the working class are worth learning for a lifetime."

### 一堂安全课

    毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。” 
    一堂安全课
    星期一上安全课时，一个同学漫不经心地说：“安全课没有什么，不上也不要紧。”一位老工人听到了这句话，马上郑重而严肃地说：“不，不是没有什么，有没有安全课，这是共产党同国民党的根本区别哪！”后来这位老工人王师傅就联系这件事给同学们讲述了他在旧社会的辛酸经历。王师傅说，他生在东北农村一个贫农家庭，七岁就开始给地主扛活，常年吃不饱，穿不暖，稍大一点就被万恶的日伪抓到北满当劳工。在那里受尽了折磨，每天只吃两碗稀饭和两个牛眼大的混合面团子，一天到晚拚命地干活，稍不留意，鬼子汉奸的皮鞭就打在身上；生了病，轻的挨饿，重的就被活活抛到山涧里去喂狗。去北满的阶级兄弟多半是这样过日子的。那时候工人在剥削阶级眼里连牲畜都不如，哪里还谈得上什么安全课呢？只有解放后，在我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，工人阶级才翻身做了主人，才开了安全课。可是中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资派，却大肆鼓吹“物质刺激”，鼓吹“利润挂帅”，叫工人为了奖金干活。他们也不顾工人安全。只有毛主席对工人最关心。一堂安全课，凝集着毛主席他老人家对工人阶级的深厚感情，体现了毛主席革命路线的光辉，怎么能说安全课上不上没什么呢？
    一滴水可以反映出太阳的光辉，一件小事反映了工人阶级对毛主席的深厚阶级感情，对社会主义制度的无比忠心，对旧社会的刻骨仇恨。同学们说：“工人阶级的先进思想，值得我们学一辈子。”
