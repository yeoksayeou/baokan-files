The journalism front has undergone and is undergoing extremely fierce class struggles during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Newspapers, periodicals, radio, and news agencies are all tools of class struggle. Their propaganda influences the thoughts and political direction of the masses. The serious struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership over the journalism front is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the ideological front.

Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the proletarian journalism industry. As early as twenty years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Running a newspaper well, this is a matter in the work of the Party that cannot be underestimated and has great principle significance." In the long-term class struggle of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao put forward a complete proletarian journalism line. According to this line, the proletarian journalism industry must serve the political line of the proletariat and must become a powerful weapon for proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

The traitor, scoundrel, and scab Liu Shaoqi and a handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party have always harbored hatred and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian journalism line. They represent the interests of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and fiercely promote a counter-revolutionary bourgeois journalism line. They have infiltrated traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders into various journalism units, attempting to turn the journalism industry into a tool for subverting proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism.

During the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, newspapers have been a focal point of the political struggles of various factions in every locality, almost without exception. Through struggle, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the journalism world have been exposed. The bourgeois journalism line they promoted has suffered a shameful failure. However, the class struggle has not ended, and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership over newspapers has not ended. Therefore, it is an important task before us to firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian journalism line and thoroughly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist journalism line.

To shout loudly for socialist revolution, or to sound the gong for the implementation of capitalism

On October 1, 1949, New China emerged like a red sun from the east. The democratic revolution was basically over, and the great socialist revolution began.

As early as April 1948, in his brilliant work "Talk with the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Comrades, you are running a newspaper. Your work is to educate the masses, to let the masses know their own interests, their own tasks, and the Party's policies and guidelines." Therefore, as a tool of proletarian dictatorship, the journalism industry of New China must clear the way for the democratic revolution to transform into a socialist revolution.

Liu Shaoqi strongly opposed the transformation of the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. He talked nonsense about "allowing capitalists to exist and develop for several decades." He demanded that newspapers clear the way for the implementation of capitalism in China.

Just half a year after Chairman Mao's "Talk with the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily" was published, Liu Shaoqi, in direct opposition, threw out a poisonous weed, "Talk with the North China Journalists' Group," openly opposing Chairman Mao's newspaper ideology.

In this speech, he proposed a super-class, bourgeois slogan of "serving the readers." He said: "You are serving the readers, serving those who read the newspaper. If the readers say it's good, then your work is done well." Readers are divided by class. Different classes of readers do not have the same likes and dislikes. Which class of "readers" does Liu Shaoqi want to "serve"? If you look at his several "speeches" after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, which had great historical significance, it becomes very clear.

In April 1949, just after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he immediately rushed to Tianjin to shout loudly for the bourgeoisie: "Now our newspapers, in propaganda, have not even given the bourgeoisie the fourth position, the focus is not on unity but on attack, which is also inappropriate." He shouted loudly: "In propaganda, there should be a position for the bourgeoisie!"

In May, he complained bitterly in Beijing: "Every day in the newspaper, there are only good news about the workers, but it's not good for the capitalists, and their good news is not published." He worked hard to plead for the capitalists: "The capitalists say our newspaper is not good, I admit there is a bit of a problem, I also admit this mistake, our newspaper has a bit of a bias, in the future we should adopt: what is right is right, what is wrong is wrong, what is good is good, what is bad is bad," "If the capitalists are good, say they are good, if the workers are bad, say they are bad!"

In August, he went to the Northeast and spoke in the tone of the capitalists: "The capitalists feel that they are praised very much in normal times, but in the newspaper, they are said to be bad, the good deeds of the workers are reported, and the bad deeds of the capitalists are reported."

Liu Shaoqi worked so hard, again and again, to shout loudly for the position of the bourgeoisie! This number one agent of the bourgeoisie, his so-called "readers," are none other than his masters, the bourgeoisie!

Chairman Mao pointed out in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: After the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide and the resolution of the land problem, the basic contradiction within the country is "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." With the position of the bourgeoisie, there is no position for the proletariat; with the position of capitalism, there is no position for socialism. Liu Shaoqi's struggle for the "position" of the capitalists in the newspapers is precisely to overthrow the leadership of the proletariat and develop capitalism in China. Indeed, the radio broadcasted the communication "My Dream Has Come True!" praising Liu Shaoqi's good friend, the big capitalist Song Qincheng of Tianjin, and the newspapers published the black editorial "Struggle for the Prosperity of the Farmers in North China" openly advocating the development of agricultural capitalism, and the slogans "Work hard to get rich, produce to get rich," "To get rich, plant cotton," etc., advocating the spontaneous forces of agricultural capitalism.

The capitalists were overjoyed, and the landlords and rich peasants were smiling: their agents brought them good news of developing capitalism!

Liu Shaoqi's "right and wrong," "good and bad" are very clear. He saw that our newspapers were biased towards the proletariat, biased towards socialism, and was very dissatisfied; the capitalists frowned, and he quickly admitted "mistakes," doing his utmost to show servility. He was truly a faithful dog of the capitalists! And those dogs of the dogs, the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements like Lu Dingyi, actually proposed that "our party's publications should adapt to the needs of all classes, including the bourgeoisie," and ordered all levels of party newspapers "not to publicly宣传 that they are CCP organs, nor to say they are government organs, just call them so-and-so newspaper." To please the capitalists, to smoothly turn the party's journalism industry into a tool for implementing capitalism, they did it so thoroughly that they didn't even want the Communist Party's sign. They were truly despicable and shameless to the extreme!

Chairman Mao said: "The birth of a new social system is always accompanied by a great shouting, that is, to propagate the superiority of the new system and criticize the backwardness of the old system." Liu Shaoqi did the opposite, trying to make the proletarian journalism industry reverse course, turning it into a reactionary tool blocking the socialist tide and developing the capitalist system. However, "opportunists who want to block the tide are almost everywhere, but the tide is unblockable, socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, throwing all obstacles behind it." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the great Chinese socialist revolution broke through the numerous obstacles of the capitalist-roaders and advanced rapidly.

Liu Shaoqi's liberalization policy and the bourgeois rightists' attack

In 1956, just after the basic completion of the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production on the economic front, the bourgeoisie and their agents, unwilling to retreat from the historical stage, took advantage of the opportunity after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, when modern revisionism was rampant, attempting to counterattack politically and regain the positions they had lost. At this time, Liu Shaoqi thought that the "change of heaven" was coming, and in the short span of twenty days in May and June, he convened the journalism world's handful of capitalist-roaders three times, issuing black directives and formulating black guidelines, in order to control the journalism tools and shout slogans for his restoration of capitalism.

Liu Shaoqi's three speeches were long and stinky, full of fallacies, and impossible to refute. Summarizing them in one point, they opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian journalism line and blatantly advocated bourgeois liberalization, paving the way for the nationwide rightists' rampant attack. Here, only the main three points are exposed:

First: "Is it better for Xinhua News Agency to be a state news agency or to be a common person? I think it's better not to be a state news agency, to be a common person." Why? He shouted in anger: "Now everything has become state-run, even agricultural cooperatives have become state-run," Xinhua News Agency should be "privately run," "do not emphasize the official identity, and do not bind yourself too tightly." "State-run" means proletarian dictatorship. Liu Shaoqi thought that proletarian dictatorship restricted the bourgeois journalism line, demanding freedom to oppose proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. Chairman Mao taught us: Before the classes are eliminated, newspapers, periodicals, radio, and news agencies all have class characteristics and serve a certain class. The journalism industry must definitely be led or "bound" by a certain class, and there is no such thing as a journalism industry that is not "bound." Not being bound by the proletariat means being bound by the bourgeoisie, and one of the two must be chosen. Where in the world today is there a super-class newspaper?

The bourgeoisie has long boasted that their newspapers are "civilian," "free from party affiliations," and "not bound by party relations." But more than a hundred years have passed, and these newspapers with the "civilian" signboard still can only serve as tools for certain parties or certain financial groups. Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "private operation" and "being a common person" is all a facade, a means for the bourgeoisie to struggle for "freedom" and seize "rights," demanding the removal of "restrictions." It is clear that the so-called "private operation" is to cancel the leadership of the proletariat, to cancel the leadership of the Communist Party, in one word, it is the bourgeoisie operating.

Second: "Foreign journalists emphasize that their news reports are objective, true, and fair reports; objective, true, and fair reports are their slogans. If we do not dare to emphasize objective and true reports, but only emphasize the standpoint, then our reports will have subjectivism and one-sidedness." Look, Liu Shaoqi, this thoroughgoing lackey, is so admiring of "foreign" bourgeois journalists that he wants proletarian newspapers to completely copy "their slogans."

News has class characteristics and party characteristics, and there is no such thing as super-class "objective reporting." The bourgeoisie newspapers, in order to deceive the people and maintain their class's evil rule, have always distorted objective facts at will, slandered revolutionary people, and there is no such thing as "objective," "true," and "fair" to speak of! Those "objective," "true," and "fair" and other pleasant words are only a few filthy fig leaves used to cover up their service to the bourgeoisie and the maintenance of bourgeois interests!

The proletariat has never hidden its views. Proletarian news is to reflect the demands of the proletariat and revolutionary people, to serve the interests of the vast majority. Proletarian journalists, relying on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the most sharp weapon, not only can recognize the essence and laws of objective things but also dare to reveal this essence and law in news reports. Only by standing firmly on the proletarian standpoint can one correctly reflect objective reality. Liu Shaoqi attempted to replace the party character and class character of proletarian newspapers with the bourgeoisie's "objective," "true," and "fair" slogans, saying: "Now the news reports have a bias—only the good is reported, and there is one-sidedness. The good should be reported, and the bad should also be reported," "to report (in capitalist countries) what others say good about us and what they curse us about," "not only to tell the truth to imperialism but also to tell the truth about the mistakes of the Communist Party." This seemingly "impartial" preaching is precisely in line with the interests of a handful of reactionaries and can only be welcomed by the bourgeoisie and imperialism. Talking about not having a standpoint, but in fact, their buttocks are sitting on the same bench as the enemies of the proletariat. The so-called "objective," "fair" and so on, are originally thorough lies!

Third: Newspapers "should have a few different opinions. This place is 'let a hundred schools of thought contend.'" It should be pointed out that within the people, we allow different opinions to freely discuss in the newspapers, "so that the advanced people can educate the backward people through democratic and persuasive methods, overcome backward ideas and institutions." However, for all reactionaries, we must implement a single voice in public opinion, not allowing them to express "different opinions," not giving them any freedom. Lenin said well: "We do not intend to turn our organ into a simple pile of various views. On the contrary, we will run the newspaper with a serious and clear-cut policy. In a word, this policy is Marxism." Proletarian newspapers must clearly oppose all anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary classes, reactionary factions, and reactionary trends, and not engage in this struggle, proletarian newspapers will lose their revolutionary soul.

Liu Shaoqi, using the method of stealing heaven and changing the mandate, obliterated the class content of the revolutionary policy of "let a hundred schools of thought contend," attempting to replace it with "a few different opinions." As Chairman Mao repeatedly pointed out, the so-called "hundred schools" are actually two schools, one for the proletariat and one for the bourgeoisie. The political tendency of a newspaper, in the end, is either the opinion of the proletariat or the opinion of the bourgeoisie; it is either to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought or to propagate bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. Liu Shaoqi even boasted: Xinhua News Agency "should be open," "I advocate openness"; "newspapers can be more liberal." It is very clear that the "a few different opinions" he advocated is precisely to allow various bourgeois thoughts to "open up" and spread freely, not allowing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to have a voice.

This is the whole set of liberalization and revisionist newspaper policies formulated by Liu Shaoqi. Against this bourgeois liberalization evil wind, Chairman Mao repeatedly gave it a head-on blow. In May 1957, Chairman Mao made a concentrated exposure and criticism of this rather serious revisionist thought within the party. Chairman Mao pointed out: "They deny the party character and class character of newspapers, they confuse the fundamental differences between proletarian journalism and bourgeois journalism, they confuse the journalism of reflecting the collective economy of a socialist state with the journalism of reflecting the anarchic state and group competition of the economy of a capitalist state. They admire bourgeois liberalism, oppose party leadership. They advocate democracy, oppose centralism. They oppose the necessary but not excessive centralized leadership, planning, and control of cultural and educational undertakings (including the journalism industry) required to realize planned economy. They resonate with right-wing intellectuals in society, form a united front, and are as close as brothers."

It was precisely Liu Shaoqi's whole set of bourgeois liberalization policies that became the general action plan for the handful of capitalist-roaders and rightists within the party's journalism world to seize the proletarian journalism front and engage in anti-party and anti-socialist activities, becoming the mobilization order for the rightists' rampant attack in 1957.

Not long after Liu Shaoqi's three speeches, through the specific planning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Deng Tuo, Wu Lianxi, and Mei Yi, newspapers, radio, and news agencies carried out a series of so-called "reforms" or "revisions." They wanted to turn the tools of proletarian dictatorship into "public weapons," "social organs of speech," so that "people with different views" could "express different opinions." The rightist elements in the journalism world also barked like mad dogs. They cursed party newspapers as "official newspapers," as "the only one, no other"; they wanted to "publish non-party newspapers," saying that "the same-person newspapers should be turned into democratic party newspapers," and even shouted that "under socialism, newspapers can sing a counterpoint, can help each other." For a time, black clouds pressed down on the city, and the reactionary bourgeois journalism line was put forward. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party's journalism world formed an alliance with the bourgeois rightists, seizing the leadership of some newspapers, using the journalism front to launch a rampant attack on socialism. Particularly worth mentioning is the old Wen Hui Daily, which was controlled by the notorious rightist element Xu Zhizheng. This newspaper, which was very much to Liu Shaoqi's taste, claimed to be "scholars discussing politics," "discussing politics without participating in politics," and "superior" and "privately run," became the vanguard of anti-party and anti-socialism in 1957. It hung up Liu Shaoqi's "objective" and "fair" signboard, published a large amount of reactionary news that violated the facts, published a large amount of reactionary speeches, and used a large amount of reactionary layout, stirring up the wind and waves, attempting to create chaos in the world, in order to overthrow the Communist Party and let the bourgeois rightists take its place. Countless facts show that in 1957, the journalism world was in chaos, and its source was Liu Shaoqi's three speeches in 1956.

Chairman Mao saw from the beginning that on the political and ideological front, this class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is inevitable. In early 1957, Chairman Mao, in his famous "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," scientifically, systematically, and profoundly analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, expounded the laws of class struggle in socialist society, proposed the theory, policy, and guidelines of distinguishing between enemy and people's internal contradictions and correctly handling these two types of contradictions, and proposed the great revolutionary policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" for the proletariat. Chairman Mao, in view of the then political situation, firmly pointed out: "Do not be afraid to let them bloom, do not be afraid of criticism, and do not be afraid of weeds." "Ghosts and monsters must be let out of their cages to be annihilated, and weeds must be let out of the ground to be weeded out." However, Liu Shaoqi's agent Deng Tuo, actually blocked Chairman Mao's voice on the party newspaper, refused to publicize Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and kept the party's policy secret; but allowed some non-party newspapers controlled by the bourgeois rightists to make distorted propaganda, to protect the weeds from being exposed in the newspapers, and to interfere with and sabotage the great struggle against the bourgeois rightists. Chairman Mao conducted extremely sharp criticism of this, pointing out: The party's newspapers should publicize the party's policies in a timely manner. The propaganda work conference did not publish news, which was a mistake. This conference was jointly held by party members and non-party members, why did it not publish news? Why did the highest state council not issue a commentary? Why did the party's policy be kept secret? Where is the ghost? In the past, it was said that scholars were running the newspaper, now it should be said that the dead are running the newspaper. Most of you are against the central guidelines, are resistant, oppose the central guidelines, and do not approve of the central guidelines.

All the plots of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements are ultimately in vain. On July 1, that year, Chairman Mao personally wrote an important editorial for the People's Daily, "The Bourgeois Direction of Wen Hui Daily Should Be Criticized." In this brilliant document and a series of related instructions, Chairman Mao highly summarized the life-and-death struggle between the two classes in China's political and ideological front (especially in the journalism world) in 1957, and sharply and profoundly criticized Liu Shaoqi's entire set of bourgeois liberalization policies, sweeping away the evil mist in the journalism world. Those rightist ghosts who were once arrogant were annihilated under the mighty revolutionary power of Mao Zedong Thought.

A strategy for creating public opinion to restore capitalism

In August 1959, at the Lushan Conference, the anti-party clique of Peng Dehuai, under the protection of Liu Shaoqi, jumped out to fiercely oppose the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, attempting to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. However, their plot did not succeed. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flew high, and the right opportunists were dismissed.

In 1961, Chairman Mao personally presided over the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, once again affirming that "the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are in line with China's actual situation," and sharply pointed out that "a few percent of the extremely few landlord class elements and bourgeois elements who have not been reformed... they always try to restore, they use the difficulties caused by natural disasters and some shortcomings in the work of the grassroots to engage in sabotage activities."

Liu Shaoqi, who always dreams of restoring capitalism, once again stretched his black hand towards the journalism world. In this period, the handful of capitalist-roaders raised by Liu Shaoqi had already controlled many journalism units. Not long after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Liu Shaoqi told his agents in the journalism world: "Reporting should not be so closely linked to reality, if it is too closely linked to reality, reporting the current specific work and struggle, it will make mistakes. You should learn to be both linked to reality and maintain a certain distance from reality. Do not revolve around the current reality, but you can also report some things that are less related to the current struggle." On one hand, to "maintain a certain distance from reality," on the other hand, to "report some things that are less related to the current struggle," this is Liu Shaoqi's more sinister and cunning new strategy in the new situation. This strategy, in the words of his running dogs, is called "fighting a flanking battle," that is, "not emphasizing direct coordination," but using the method of "speaking small, seeing big," from "different angles," in "different forms," to "implicitly" contain the "theme" of anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought in "indirect" penmanship, to "indirectly" cooperate with the activities of restoring capitalism.

This is a very poisonous counter-revolutionary strategy! Liu Shaoqi's agents in the journalism world understood it very well, and they said frankly: "Writing travelogues, writing knowledge, this is a political need!" That notorious traitor Deng Tuo even shouted excitedly at the "immortal gathering" of four newspapers in Beijing: "With this strategy, we should strive to open up a new path!"

What kind of "new path" did they open? Wu Lianxi personally took action and opened a column called "Long and Short Records" in the party newspaper, with the purpose of "correcting the times." After the "Yan Mountain Night Talk" came out, the "Three Villages" black shop run by Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mingsha also opened for business; the radio station set up programs such as "Historical Stories" and "Reading and Appreciation"; many local newspapers appeared with columns such as "Yunnan Clouds and Jokes" and "Luoyang Jokes," and so on.

It was along this "new path" that those traitors, spies, "three teachings and nine schools," ghosts and monsters, feudal class remnants, and bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" first peeked and then strutted into the journalism world, becoming the counter-revolutionary henchmen of Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They colluded with each other, used each other, for their common "political needs," and used all kinds of tricks such as using ancient times to criticize the present, pointing to the mulberry to curse the osmanthus, beating around the bush, and deceiving the heavens, to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

What "maintaining a certain distance from reality"? It's all nonsense! Look: They dug up the feudal corpses of Hai Rui, Yu Qian, and Li Sanzhai, and blatantly pleaded for the dismissed Peng Dehuai and his gang at the Lushan Conference, giving them support and encouragement, is this "maintaining a distance from reality"? They used various "stories," "allegories," and "metaphors," and used all means to attack the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to attack Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is this "maintaining a distance from reality"? They used the pretext of "appreciating useful ancient and modern knowledge" to push the rotten thoughts of the landlord class and bourgeoisie, to poison people's souls, to undermine people's fighting spirit, and to carry out a comprehensive "peaceful evolution," is this "maintaining a distance from reality"? In fact, it was precisely the period when counter-revolutionary poisonous weeds were rampantly sprouting in "reality." Liu Shaoqi and his actions were closely linked to "reality." Mei Yi, who had once vigorously promoted the "theory of maintaining distance," revealed the essence of this "theory." He said: "It seems to be disconnected from reality, but this is the best way to link to reality. Not linking is also linking, linking to the big reality." This so-called "big reality" is not the "reality" of Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism!

What "things that are less related to the current struggle"? No. This is a heart-pounding class struggle. They hid behind "things that are less related to the current struggle," creating counter-revolutionary public opinion in the ideological realm. They used the method of "cutting off the head with a soft knife," they were a group of executioners who killed without blood, and once the time was ripe, they would overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

A sudden thunderclap. Just as this group of man-eating demons were bared their fangs and claws, the great leader Chairman Mao issued a thunderous call at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee: Never forget class struggle! Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "Whoever wants to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion, must first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts educated the whole party and the people of the whole country, giving a crushing blow to Liu Shaoqi's evil activities of using the public opinion front to restore capitalism.

Liu Shaoqi is the chief culprit opposing the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought

Under the advocacy of Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, the whole country saw the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao repeatedly instructed newspapers to vigorously publicize Mao Zedong Thought, to "hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and run the newspaper according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions." It was at this time, in 1964, that Liu Shaoqi, unable to suppress his extreme hatred for the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, jumped out to curse the newspapers for propagating Mao Zedong Thought "too much," saying that "too much is dangerous." The master called, and the servants responded. Liu Shaoqi's agents in the journalism world immediately wielded the three big sticks of "formalism," "simplification," and "vulgarization," striving to obstruct the propaganda of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the reporting of the mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They shouted madly: "Workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be effective immediately," and "do not make a fuss about propagating Mao Zedong Thought." They openly ordered: "Learn from the PLA, learn from the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, there was a period of much propaganda, now it does not need to be so concentrated and prominent," "do not mention the 'high tide' of studying Chairman Mao's works." This group of usurpers of the leadership of China's journalism world, according to Liu Shaoqi's will, compressed the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought to the lowest limit. Once the words "hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought," "under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought" appeared in the manuscripts, they would immediately cross them out. For manuscripts reporting workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, they either arbitrarily suppressed them or used reactionary layout methods to demean them.

People cannot help but ask: Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the journalism world, as soon as they saw the newspapers propagating Mao Zedong Thought, they were startled and frightened, and as soon as they saw the publication of heroes who were armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they attacked them fiercely, what is the difference between this and the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries who, as soon as they saw a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" or a Mao badge, were frightened and called in large numbers of armed police to search and beat them up?!

Our era is an era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized: "Arming the workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and a wide range of cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, further promoting the thought revolution of the people, is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and make our socialist and communist cause victorious."

Therefore, whether to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought or not to propagate it or to counter-propagate it, is the dividing line between proletarian newspapers and bourgeois newspapers, and is also the touchstone to distinguish Marxists-Leninists from counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, criticize everything, and transform everything, this is the most fundamental and important task of proletarian newspapers.

Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, our newspapers can help the broad masses of the people to get rid of the influence and constraints of the exploiting classes' thoughts, resist the infiltration of revisionist and bourgeois thoughts, and promote the thought revolution of the people.

Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. The socialist journalism industry, as a tool of proletarian dictatorship, vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought, uses Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the counter-revolutionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, is an important aspect of the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including various cultural fields, and has great significance for defending the proletarian dictatorship and preventing the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union from repeating in China.

Mao Zedong Thought is the great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is the guiding principle for all the work of the whole party and the whole country. To hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to insist on highlighting Mao Zedong Thought in all propaganda, our newspapers can correctly guide the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, organize and inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to follow the course indicated by Chairman Mao, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our proletarian newspapers. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, our newspapers can fully play the role of "great organization, inspiration, encouragement, criticism, and promotion" in the long-term struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, this is the highest standard for us to run newspapers well. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the journalism world, crazily sabotaged the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to block the great spread and popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, which is all in vain. The great revolutionary people of the whole country are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, which has become the great tide of our times. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the whole of China and the whole world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the failure of Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois journalism line

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao was like a thunderclap, violently blowing open the counter-revolutionary independent kingdom of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the journalism world, shaking the land of China. Liu Shaoqi and his pack of wolves and dogs, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and the like, were immediately thrown into disarray. To save their last doomed fate, they hastily fabricated a counter-revolutionary "February Outline" that distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, suppressed revolution, and protected the bad. They used a series of tricks, continued to control newspapers and periodicals, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames, shift the target, and cover the retreat.

The epoch-making document—May 16th Notice, personally presided over by Chairman Mao, gave a destructive blow to Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Chairman Mao called on the whole party to hold high the great banner of proletarian cultural revolution, "thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary thoughts in the academic, educational, journalism, literary and art, and publishing circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields." In January 1967, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Wen Hui Daily, rose up and seized the leadership from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, first launching the great "January Revolution" storm in the journalism world. Chairman Mao gave a high evaluation of the Wen Hui Daily's seizure of power, pointing out: This is a great revolution, a revolution of one class overthrowing another class.

The journalism front, like other fronts, entered a new stage of struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party during the Cultural Revolution. The ruling power of Liu Shaoqi in the journalism world collapsed completely. Those old newspapers like "Yangcheng Evening News" and "Southern Daily" that poisoned and spread rumors were sealed, stormed, and had their power seized by the revolutionary faction. Great! Great! This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The eighteen-year-long fierce class struggle on the journalism front has provided us with extremely rich and precious experience and lessons.

First, firmly and consistently propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of proletarian newspapers, radio, and news agencies. Proletarian newspapers must regard the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty. We must strive to run the newspaper as a large school to study, spread, and popularize Mao Zedong Thought, to use Mao Zedong Thought to command all aspects of news reporting, to transmit Chairman Mao's voice most quickly and accurately, to make Mao Zedong Thought combine with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to become conscious action, and to become an endless force to transform the world. The propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought must be accurate. For all actions that distort, falsify, or violate Mao Zedong Thought, especially for those despicable practices of opposing the red flag under the red flag, whether from the right or the extreme "left," we must resolutely resist, resolutely oppose, and thoroughly criticize. To block Chairman Mao's voice is the common despicable trick of all counter-revolutionary revisionists, and our newspapers must resolutely do the opposite. In this way, the newspaper can hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and clearly point out the direction of struggle to the broad revolutionary masses in every period.

The propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought must insist on fighting against all anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary thoughts in a head-on manner. At present, we must continue to launch a great exposure and criticism of modern revisionism in the world. We must further criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," criticize sectarianism, factionalism, individualism, and other manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary worldview, and criticize all anti-proletarian reactionary viewpoints. Break first, establish in the middle. Mao Zedong Thought is developed in the struggle against various bourgeois reactionary thoughts.

Second, as long as there is class division in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle. This is Chairman Mao's basic view on newspaper work. The proletariat must seize the leadership of newspapers in their own hands, making them tools of proletarian dictatorship, while the bourgeoisie also tries to seize the leadership of newspapers, making them tools to subvert proletarian dictatorship. This has been the focus of the class struggle on the journalism front in our country for the past eighteen years. After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, this struggle has not ended, and those representatives of the bourgeoisie will still use various despicable means to conspire with the proletariat to seize the leadership of the journalism industry. Therefore, it is an important task at present to thoroughly clean up the class ranks, to eliminate a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, reactionary writers, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and to build a proletarian journalism team. Only by doing this work can we establish and develop the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution organizationally. At all levels of journalism units, we must establish a revolutionary, vigorous, and fighting leadership team, and boldly promote a group of new proletarian forces, to ensure that the leadership of China's journalism industry is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, and have revolutionary spirit. We must pay attention to the fact that people change, and we must constantly clean out those corrupt elements, not allowing them to control the tools of newspapers and news.

Third, we must thoroughly and persistently criticize the reactionary bourgeois journalism line, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and carry the struggle between the two lines in the journalism world to the end. At present, in addition to criticizing the bourgeois journalism line from history, we must pay special attention to criticizing the extremely wrong practice of using journalism tools to serve only a certain bourgeois or petty-bourgeois faction. Newspapers, radio stations, and the like in various places must resolutely implement the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, criticize bourgeois liberalism. A handful of class enemies, in order to save their failure, use all means to spread rumors and slander, create "inside information," spread all kinds of rumors, attempting to confuse truth with falsehood, muddy the waters, interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Against this counter-revolutionary activity, we must resolutely expose and strike it. The broad revolutionary masses must be good at distinguishing true from false in the complex class struggle, and seeing through the enemy's tricks. There are still some comrades in our ranks who, for the sake of small factional interests, either take the instructions of the proletarian headquarters out of context, each taking what they need, publishing sensational news and pictures to create a certain public opinion; or, disregarding the overall situation and the interests of the proletariat, arbitrarily publish various materials and documents, seriously leaking the secrets of the party and the state: these are all very wrong, and are the evil manifestations of the poison of the bourgeois journalism line in the Cultural Revolution, which must be resolutely corrected. Chairman Mao warned us: "The propaganda in the newspaper must be seen whether it is beneficial or harmful to the people." "Speaking and writing must strive to be in line with the taste of the enemy and imperialism, this is to deceive the masses, and the result is that the enemy is comfortable, while our class is blinded." I advise those who have been poisoned by the bourgeois journalism line and are still unaware to read Chairman Mao's great teachings well.

Chairman Mao's "Talk with the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," and Chairman Mao's series of instructions on journalism work are the only correct guidelines for us to run newspapers, radio, news agencies, and all journalism industries, and are also powerful weapons to criticize the reactionary bourgeois journalism line. We must implement Chairman Mao's journalism line resolutely in action, and establish a serious, scientific, and fighting style of the proletariat.

Fourth, journalism agencies must take the path of streamlining and efficiency, and must resolutely implement the mass line, closely link with the working class and the laboring masses.

Chairman Mao taught us: The fundamental problem of running a newspaper well is the problem of the thought revolution of the newspaper staff. "The newspaper staff should often go down to the lower levels, breathe fresh air, and not stay in Beijing for too long. Those who go down should do work and also be reporters." Chairman Mao also said: "Our newspapers should also be run by everyone, run by the masses of the people, run by the whole party, and not just by a few people closing the door to run." Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "We should not run the newspaper behind closed doors, but face the masses, and we should also have a big direction and be lively and fresh."

All journalism agencies must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, bravely jump out of various old frameworks and old habits, face the masses, and implement streamlining and efficiency.

What is the use of so many people to run newspapers and periodicals? We must streamline and efficiency, strengthen the connection between journalists and the masses, and carry out a great revolution, thoroughly changing the bourgeois lordly style of despising workers and peasants and running the newspaper behind closed doors, and better implementing Chairman Mao's line of running the newspaper by the masses. Streamlining and efficiency is a very important organizational guarantee for running proletarian newspapers well at present. We should recruit workers with proletarian consciousness and production experience into the newspaper office, train a large number of workers and peasants correspondents who do not leave production, and break the situation where intellectuals are piled up.

Those who do journalism work must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, must combine with the laboring people, must stand on the proletarian standpoint to conduct thorough investigations and research, must be good at timely reflecting the advanced typical things in the revolutionary masses, reflecting the voice of the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary people advancing, must implement the line of coming from the masses, going to the masses, concentrating, and persevering taught by Chairman Mao. If this problem is not solved, it is impossible to run a proletarian newspaper well, and it is very easy to lose the leadership. This problem still needs to be further solved.

Let us hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, and carry the great revolution on the journalism front through to the end!

    把新闻战线的大革命进行到底
    ——批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的新闻路线
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，新闻战线经历了和经历着极其剧烈的阶级斗争。
    新闻事业，包括报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社，统统是阶级斗争的工具。它们的宣传，影响着群众的思想情绪和政治方向。无产阶级同资产阶级争夺新闻阵地领导权的严重斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级在思想战线上的生死搏斗。
    毛主席历来十分重视无产阶级的新闻事业。早在二十年前，毛主席就指出：办好报纸，“这是党的工作中的一项不可小看的、有重大原则意义的问题。”①在中国革命的长期阶级斗争中，毛主席提出了一条完整的无产阶级新闻路线。按照这条路线，无产阶级新闻事业必须为无产阶级的政治路线服务，必须成为无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的有力武器。
    中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派，一贯仇视和反对毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线。他们代表帝国主义、国民党反动派和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，疯狂推行反革命的资产阶级新闻路线，把叛徒、特务、走资派安插到各个新闻单位中，妄图使新闻事业变成颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。
    在急风暴雨般的无产阶级文化大革命中，报纸是各地各派政治力量斗争的焦点之一，几乎无一例外。经过斗争，中国赫鲁晓夫及其新闻界的代理人被揪出来了。他们所推行的资产阶级新闻路线，遭到了可耻的破产。然而，阶级斗争并没有结束，无产阶级同资产阶级争夺报纸领导权的斗争并没有结束。因此，大立毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线，对反革命修正主义新闻路线进行彻底的清算，是摆在我们面前的一个重要任务。
    为社会主义革命大喊大叫，还是为实行资本主义鸣锣开道
    一九四九年十月一日，新中国象一轮红日从东方喷薄而出。民主革命基本结束，伟大的社会主义革命开始了。
    还在一九四八年四月，毛主席在《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》这篇光辉著作中，就已经指出：“同志们是办报的。你们的工作，就是教育群众，让群众知道自己的利益，自己的任务，和党的方针政策。”“要教育人民认识真理，要动员人民起来为解放自己而斗争”。因此，作为无产阶级专政的舆论工具，新中国的新闻事业必须为民主革命转变为社会主义革命扫清道路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力反对民主革命向社会主义革命的转变。他胡说什么要“让资本家存在和发展几十年”②。他要求报纸为在中国实行资本主义鸣锣开道。
    就在毛主席《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》发表半年之后，中国赫鲁晓夫针锋相对地抛出了大毒草《对华北记者团的讲话》，公然同毛主席的办报思想相对抗。
    在这篇讲话中，他提出一个“为读者服务”的超阶级的资产阶级口号。他胡说道：“你们是为读者服务的，为看报的人服务的。看报的人说好，你们的工作就是作好了。”③
    “读者”是划分为阶级的。不同阶级的读者，决没有相同的爱憎。中国赫鲁晓夫要为之“服务”的是哪个阶级的“读者”呢？翻一翻他在有伟大历史意义的七届二中全会之后的几次“讲演”，就十分清楚了。
    一九四九年四月，党的七届二中全会刚刚开过，他立刻跑到天津去为资产阶级大声疾呼：“现在我们的报纸，在宣传上对自由资产阶级连第四位也没有，重点不是团结，而是打击，这也是不妥当的。”④他大声疾呼：“在宣传上有自由资产阶级的地位”⑤！
    五月，他在北京又愤愤不平地说：报纸上“每天都是工人们的好消息，但和资本家就不好，没有登他们的好消息。”⑥他卖力地替资本家“请命”：“资本家反映说我们的报纸不好，我说的确有点不大好，我也承认这个错误，我们的报纸是有一点偏向的，以后应该采取：是就是，非就非，好就好，坏就坏”，“资本家有好就说好，工人不好就说不好”⑦！
    八月，他又跑到东北操着资本家的腔调说：“资本家感觉到平时说对我们很好，但是报上就说我们坏，工人的好事登报，资本家的坏事登报。”⑧
    中国赫鲁晓夫是多么卖力地一而再、再而三地为资产阶级的地位而拚命叫喊啊！这个资产阶级的头号代理人，他所谓的“读者”，不是别的，正是他的主子资产阶级！
    毛主席在七届二中全会的报告中指出：中国革命在全国胜利并解决了土地问题以后，国内的基本矛盾就是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。有了资产阶级的地位，就没有无产阶级的地位；有了资本主义的地位，就没有社会主义的地位。中国赫鲁晓夫为资本家在报纸上争“地位”，正是为了推翻无产阶级的领导，在中国发展资本主义。果然，电台里播出了美化中国赫鲁晓夫的好朋友、天津大资本家宋棐卿的通讯《我的梦实现了！》报纸上登出了公开叫嚣发展农村资本主义的黑社论《为华北农民生活的富裕而奋斗》，登出了“勤劳发家，生产致富”，“要发家，种棉花”等鼓吹农村资本主义自发势力的口号。
    资本家得意忘形了，地主富农眉开眼笑了：他们的代理人给他们送来了发展资本主义的“好消息”！
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“是非”、“好坏”，是很鲜明的。他看到我们的报纸“偏向”无产阶级，“偏向”社会主义，就大为不满；资本家皱了一下眉头，他就赶忙去承认“错误”，竭尽奴颜婢膝之能事。真是一条资本家的忠实走狗！而那些走狗的走狗，反革命修正主义分子陆定一之流，还居然提出“我们党的报刊应适应包括资产阶级在内的各个阶级的需要”，并且下令各级党报“都不必公开宣传是中共机关报，也不必说是政府机关报，只称某地某报即可。”⑨为了讨资本家的喜欢，为了顺顺利利地把党的新闻事业变成实行资本主义的工具，他们干得是何等的彻底，连共产党的牌子都不要了。真是卑鄙无耻到了极点！
    毛主席说：“一个新的社会制度的诞生，总是要伴随一场大喊大叫的，这就是宣传新制度的优越性，批判旧制度的落后性。”⑩中国赫鲁晓夫反其道而行之，极力要使无产阶级新闻事业开倒车，把它变成阻挡社会主义潮流、发展资本主义制度的反动工具。但是，“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”?在毛主席革命路线的指引下，伟大的中国社会主义革命，冲破走资派的重重阻拦而迅猛前进了。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的自由化方针和资产阶级右派的进攻
    一九五六年，正当我国经济战线上在所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成之后，不甘心退出历史舞台的资产阶级及其代理人，趁着苏共“二十大”以后现代修正主义大出笼、大泛滥的机会，妄图从政治上反攻倒算，重新夺回他们已失去的阵地。这时候，中国赫鲁晓夫以为“变天”的气候已到，在五、六月间的短短二十几天内，连续三次召集新闻界一小撮走资派，下达黑指示，制定黑纲领，以便控制新闻工具，为他复辟资本主义摇旗呐喊。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的三次讲话，又臭又长，谬论百出，驳不胜驳。总其一点，是反对毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线，赤裸裸地主张资产阶级自由化，为全国右派的猖狂进攻鸣锣开道。这里，只把其中的主要三条拿来示众：
    一曰：“新华社做国家通讯社好，还是当老百姓好。我看，不做国家通讯社，当老百姓好”?。为什么呢？他气急败坏地嚷道：“现在什么东西都变为官办，连农业合作社也成为官办的”，新华社应该“民办”，“不要老是强调官方身份，更不要把自己束缚得死死的”。?“官办”者，即无产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫认为无产阶级专政使资产阶级新闻路线受到“束缚”，要求有反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的“自由”。毛主席教导我们：在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。?新闻事业必定要受一定阶级的领导或曰“束缚”，所谓不受“束缚”的新闻事业是根本不存在的。不受无产阶级的束缚，就受资产阶级的束缚，二者必居其一，当今世界上哪里有什么超阶级的报纸呢？
    资产阶级早就标榜他们的报纸是“民间”的，是“从党派中摆脱出来”，“不受党派关系的约束”?的。但是，一百多年过去了，这些挂着“民”字招牌的报纸，仍旧只能充当某一党派、某一财团的工具。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的什么“民办”，什么“当老百姓”，也统统不过是幌子，是代表资产阶级向无产阶级争“自由”，夺“权利”，要求解除“束缚”的一种手段。可见，所谓“民办”，就是取消无产阶级的领导，取消共产党的领导，一句话，就是资产阶级办。
    二曰：“外国记者强调他们的新闻报道是客观的、真实的、公正的报道；客观的、真实的、公正的报道，是他们的口号。我们如果不敢强调客观的、真实的报道，只强调立场，那末，我们的报道就有主观主义，有片面性。”?看，中国赫鲁晓夫这个十足的洋奴，对“外国”资产阶级记者佩服得五体投地，竟然要无产阶级报纸全盘照搬“他们的口号”。
    新闻是有阶级性、党派性的，超阶级的“客观的报道”是没有的。资产阶级报纸为了欺骗人民，维持本阶级的罪恶统治，一贯颠倒是非，混淆黑白，对客观事实任意歪曲，对革命人民横加诬蔑，哪有什么“客观”“真实”“公正”可言！那些“客观”“真实”“公正”之类动听的言词，不过是用来掩盖它们为资产阶级服务、维护资产阶级利益的几片肮脏的遮羞布！
    无产阶级从来不隐瞒自己的观点。无产阶级的新闻就是要反映无产阶级和革命人民的要求，为绝大多数人的利益服务。无产阶级记者依靠马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，不但能够认识客观事物的本质和规律，而且敢于在新闻报道中揭示这种本质和规律。只有鲜明地站在无产阶级立场上，才能正确地反映客观实际。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图以资产阶级的“客观”“真实”“公正”的口号取代无产阶级报纸的党性和阶级性，胡说什么：“现在的新闻报道有偏向——只讲好的，有片面性。应该好的要讲，不好的也要讲”，“要把（资本主义国家）那里人家说我们好的和骂我们的东西都加以报道”?，“不仅对帝国主义讲真话，而且对共产党的错误也讲真话”?。这一番貌似“不偏不倚”的说教，恰恰是符合一小撮反动派的利益，只能为资产阶级和帝国主义所欢迎。嘴上说不要立场，实际上自己的屁股却同无产阶级的敌人坐在一条板凳上。所谓“客观”“公正”云云，原来是彻头彻尾的谎言！
    三曰：报纸上“应该有几种不同的意见。这个地方就是‘百家争鸣’。”?应当指出，在人民内部，我们是允许不同的意见在报纸上进行自由讨论的，“以期由先进的人们以民主和说服的方法去教育落后的人们，克服落后的思想和制度。”?但是，对于一切反动派，则必须实行舆论一律，不许他们发表“不同的意见”，不给他们一点自由。列宁说得好：“我们不打算把我们的机关报变成形形色色的观点的简单堆砌。相反地，我们将本着严正的明确方针办报。一言以蔽之，这个方针就是马克思主义”?。无产阶级的报纸，必须旗帜鲜明地同形形色色反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动阶级、反动流派、反动思潮作斗争，不进行这种斗争，无产阶级报纸就会丧失自己革命的灵魂。
    中国赫鲁晓夫以偷天换日的手法，抹杀“百家争鸣”的革命方针的阶级内容，妄图用什么“几种不同的意见”取而代之。正如毛主席一再指出的，所谓“百家”，实为两家，无产阶级和资产阶级各一家。一张报纸的政治倾向，归根到底，不是无产阶级的意见，就是资产阶级的意见；不是宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就是宣传资产阶级、修正主义思想。中国赫鲁晓夫甚至扬言：新华社“以开放为好”，“我主张开放”?；“报纸可以自由主义一些”?。很清楚，他所鼓吹的“应该有几种不同的意见”，正是为了使形形色色的资产阶级思想“开放”出来，自由泛滥，不许马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想有发言权。
    这就是中国赫鲁晓夫所制定的一整套向资产阶级“开放”的、自由化的修正主义办报方针。对于这一股资产阶级自由化妖风，毛主席屡次给予迎头痛击。一九五七年五月间，毛主席对党内这种相当严重的修正主义思想，作了一次集中的揭露和批判。毛主席指出：“他们否认报纸的党性和阶级性，他们混同无产阶级新闻事业与资产阶级新闻事业的原则区别，他们混同反映社会主义国家集体经济的新闻事业与反映资本主义国家无政府状态和集团竞争的经济的新闻事业。他们欣赏资产阶级自由主义，反对党的领导。他们赞成民主，反对集中。他们反对为了实现计划经济所必需的对于文化教育事业（包括新闻事业在内的）必要的但不是过分集中的领导、计划和控制。他们跟社会上的右翼知识分子互相呼应，联成一起，亲如弟兄。”?
    正是中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套资产阶级自由化方针，成了新闻界党内一小撮走资派、资产阶级右派篡夺无产阶级新闻阵地、反党反社会主义的总行动纲领，成了一九五七年资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的动员令。
    中国赫鲁晓夫三次讲话不久，经过反革命修正主义分子邓拓、吴冷西、梅益之流的具体策划，报纸、广播、通讯社就进行了一系列的所谓“改版”或“改革”。他们要把无产阶级专政的舆论工具，改成“公共的武器”、“社会的言论机关”?，以便“让不同见解的人”都能“发表不同的意见”?。新闻界的右派分子，也一个个如同疯狗一般地狂吠。他们咒骂党报是“官报”，是“只此一家，别无分处”；他们要“增办非党报纸”，说什么“应该把同人报纸变成报纸的民主党派”，甚至叫嚷“社会主义下的报纸可以唱对台戏，可以小骂大帮忙”?。一时间黑云压城城欲摧，摆出了反动的资产阶级新闻路线。新闻界党内一小撮走资派与资产阶级右派结成了同盟军，他们篡夺某些报纸的领导权，利用新闻阵地向社会主义举行猖狂进攻。特别值得一提的，是由那位鼎鼎大名的右派分子徐铸成把持的旧《文汇报》。这家很合乎中国赫鲁晓夫口味的，自称是“文人论政”、“论政而不参政”的“超然”的“民办”的报纸，一九五七年成了反党反社会主义的急先锋。它挂起中国赫鲁晓夫那个“客观”“公正”的招牌，大量报道违反事实的反动新闻，大量刊发反动言论，大量采用反动编排，呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，妄图造成天下大乱，以便整垮共产党，由资产阶级右派取而代之。无数事实说明，一九五七年新闻界乌云乱翻，其源盖出于一九五六年中国赫鲁晓夫的三次讲话。
    毛主席从一开始就看出，在政治思想战线上，资产阶级与无产阶级这一场阶级斗争是不可避免的。一九五七年初，毛主席在著名的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》中，科学地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，阐明了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，提出了区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾以及正确处理这两类矛盾的理论、方针和政策，提出了无产阶级的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的伟大革命方针。毛主席针对当时的政治形势，坚定地指出：“不要怕放，不要怕批评，也不要怕毒草。”?“牛鬼蛇神只有让它们出笼，才好歼灭它们，毒草只有让他们出土，才便于锄掉。”?可是，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人邓拓，竟然在党报上封锁毛主席的声音，拒不宣传毛主席的伟大战略部署，把党的政策秘密起来；但却听任某些被资产阶级右派把持的非党报纸作歪曲宣传，以保护毒草不在报上暴露，干扰和破坏反击资产阶级右派的伟大斗争。对此，毛主席进行了极其尖锐的批评，指出：党的报纸对党的政策要及时宣传。宣传工作会议未登消息，是个错误。这次会议是党内外人士合开的，为什么不登消息？最高国务会议为什么不发社论？为什么把党的政策秘密起来？这里有鬼，鬼在什么地方？过去说是书生办报，现在应当说是死人办报。你们多半是对中央的方针唱反派，是抵触的，反对中央的方针的，不赞成中央的方针的。?
    一切反革命修正主义分子的阴谋诡计，终究是徒劳的。这年七月一日，毛主席亲自为《人民日报》撰写了重要社论《文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判》。毛主席在这篇光辉文献及一系列有关的指示中，高度概括了一九五七年我国政治思想战线（特别是新闻界）两个阶级的你死我活的斗争，尖锐而深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫一整套资产阶级自由化方针，横扫了新闻界的妖氛迷雾。那些嚣张一时的右派鬼蜮，在毛泽东思想强大的革命威力下遭到了覆灭。
    一个为复辟资本主义大造
        舆论的反革命策略
    一九五九年八月，在庐山会议上，中国赫鲁晓夫卵翼下的彭德怀反党集团，跳出来疯狂反对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，妄图推翻以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。但是，他们的阴谋没有得逞。毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬，右倾机会主义分子被罢了官。
    一九六一年，毛主席亲自主持的党的八届九中全会，再一次肯定了“党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社是适合中国的实际情况的”，并尖锐指出“占人口百分之几的极少数没有改造好的地主阶级分子和资产阶级分子……他们总是企图复辟，他们利用自然灾害所造成的困难和某些基层工作中的缺点，进行破坏活动。”
    时刻梦想着复辟资本主义的中国赫鲁晓夫，又一次把黑手伸向新闻界。在这个时期，中国赫鲁晓夫豢养起来的一小撮走资派，已经控制了许多新闻单位。八届九中全会结束不久，中国赫鲁晓夫就对他在新闻界的代理人说：“报道联系实际不要那么紧，联系得紧了，报道了当前的具体工作和斗争，要犯错误。你们要学会既联系实际，又与实际保持一定距离。不要围着目前的实际转，也可以报道些与当前斗争关系小些的事情。”?
    一面要“与实际保持一定距离”，一面要“报道些与当前斗争关系小些的事情”，这是中国赫鲁晓夫在新的形势下所采取的更阴险、更狡猾的新策略。这个策略，用他的走狗们的话来说，叫做“打迂回战”，就是“不强调直接配合”，而是用“所言者小，所见者大”的手法，从“不同角度”，以“不同形式”，把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的“主题”“含蓄”在“宛转”的笔调之中，间接“配合”?资本主义的复辟活动。
    这是一个极其毒辣的反革命策略！中国赫鲁晓夫在新闻界的代理人对此心领神会，他们直言不讳地说：“搞游记、搞知识，这是政治的需要”！那个臭名昭著的大叛徒邓拓，甚至在北京市四家报刊举行的“神仙会”上，欣喜若狂地叫嚣：要凭着这个策略“努力打开一条新路”?！
    他们打开的是一条什么“新路”呢？吴冷西亲自动手，在党报上开辟了以所谓“匡正时弊”为宗旨的《长短录》专栏；继《燕山夜话》出笼之后，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙合股经营的“三家村”黑店也开张营业；广播电台开设了《历史故事》、《阅读与欣赏》等专题节目；许多地方报纸相继出现了《滇云漫谭》、《历下漫话》之类的“知识性”专栏，如此等等。
    正是沿着这条“新路”，那些叛徒、特务、“三教九流”、牛鬼蛇神、封建阶级的遗老遗少、资产阶级的“学者”“权威”，先是探头探脑、继而大摇大摆地踏进新闻界，成了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命打手。他们互相勾结，互相利用，为了共同的“政治上的需要”，使尽了借古讽今、指桑骂槐、旁敲侧击、瞒天过海的阴谋诡计，大干其反革命勾当。
    什么“与实际保持一定距离”？完全是骗人的鬼话！请看：他们抬出海瑞、于谦、李三才之类的封建僵尸，露骨地为庐山会议上被罢了官的彭德怀一伙鸣冤叫屈，撑腰打气，这与实际“保持距离”吗？他们利用各种“故事”、“寓言”、“比喻”，不择手段地攻击以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级司令部，攻击毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这与实际“保持距离”吗？他们在所谓“领略古今有用的知识”这个幌子的掩护下，拚命地推销腐朽的地主阶级资产阶级思想，毒害人们的灵魂，瓦解人们的斗志，全面地推行“和平演变”，这与实际“保持距离”吗？事实上，当时正是反革命大毒草在“实际”中疯狂出笼的时期。中国赫鲁晓夫们的所作所为，与“实际”的联系紧得很。曾经卖力推行“保持距离”论的梅益，一语道破了这个“理论”的实质。他说：“看来好象与实际脱节，其实这是最好的联系实际的做法。不联系也是联系，联系了大的实际。”?这个所谓“大的实际”，不就是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的“实际”么！
    什么“与当前斗争关系小些的事情”？不对。这是一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争。他们躲在“与当前斗争关系小些的事情”背后，在意识形态领域中大造反革命舆论。他们使用的是“软刀子割头”的办法，他们是一伙杀人不见血的刽子手，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要推翻无产阶级专政。
    平地一声春雷。正在这群吃人魔鬼张牙舞爪的时候，伟大统帅毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了震天动地的号召：千万不要忘记阶级斗争！毛主席英明地指出：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”毛主席的光辉思想，教育了全党和全国人民，给中国赫鲁晓夫利用舆论阵地复辟资本主义的罪恶活动以粉碎性打击。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是反对宣传毛泽东
        思想的罪魁祸首
    在毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志倡导下，全国出现活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。林彪同志多次指示报纸，要大力宣传毛泽东思想，要“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席指示的精神办报”?。正是这个时候，一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫按捺不住他对宣传毛泽东思想的无比仇恨，跳出来大骂报纸上宣传毛泽东思想“太多了”，胡说什么“太多了，就有一定的危险性”?。主子一呼，奴才百应。中国赫鲁晓夫在新闻界的代理人，立即挥舞起“形式主义”、“简单化”、“庸俗化”三根大棒，竭力阻挠宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，阻挠报道工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们丧心病狂地叫嚷：“工农兵学习毛主席著作是不能立竿见影的”?，宣传毛泽东思想“不要起哄”。他们公然下令：“学习解放军，学习毛选，有一个时期宣传很多，现在不必那样集中突出了”?，“学习毛主席著作不提‘高潮’”?。这一伙窃取我国新闻界领导权的反革命修正主义分子，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，把对毛泽东思想的宣传压缩到了最低限度。稿件中一出现“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗”、“在毛泽东思想指导下”等字眼，他们就提笔涂掉。对于报道工农兵学习毛主席著作的稿件，他们不是无端扣压，就是采用反动的编排手法加以贬低。
    人们不禁要问：中国赫鲁晓夫及其新闻界代理人，一看到报纸上宣传了毛泽东思想就心惊肉跳，一看到发表用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄典范就拚命攻击，这和帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派们看到一本《毛主席语录》、一枚毛主席像章，就惶惶然调来大批武装军警，进行搜捕和殴打，到底有什么区别？！
    我们的时代是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    党的八届十一中全会强调指出：“用毛泽东思想武装工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部，进一步促进人的思想革命化，是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，使我们的社会主义和共产主义事业取得胜利的最可靠、最根本的保证。”
    因此，对伟大的毛泽东思想是宣传还是不宣传或反宣传，这是区别无产阶级报纸和资产阶级报纸的分水岭，也是区别马克思列宁主义者和反革命修正主义分子的试金石。
    努力宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，批判一切，改造一切，这是无产阶级报纸的最根本、最重要的任务。
    毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义。宣传好毛泽东思想，我们的报纸就能帮助广大群众摆脱剥削阶级思想的影响和束缚，抵制修正主义、资产阶级思想的侵蚀，促进人的思想革命化。
    毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。社会主义新闻事业作为无产阶级专政的工具，大力宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反革命思想，是无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括各个文化领域中对资产阶级实行专政的一个重要方面，对于捍卫无产阶级政权，防止苏联资本主义复辟在中国重演，有着极大的意义。
    毛泽东思想是在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持在一切宣传中突出毛泽东思想，我们的报纸就能正确地指导阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，组织和鼓舞亿万革命人民沿着毛主席指引的航道，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级报纸的灵魂。宣传好毛泽东思想，我们的报纸才能在巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的长期斗争中，充分发挥“极大的组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动的作用”?。宣传好毛泽东思想，这是我们办好报纸的最高标准。中国赫鲁晓夫及其新闻界代理人，疯狂破坏毛泽东思想的宣传，妄图阻挡毛泽东思想的大传播、大普及，完全是枉费心机。广大革命人民大学大用毛泽东思想，已经成为我们时代的伟大潮流。毛泽东思想的光辉，照耀着全中国、全世界。
    无产阶级文化大革命和中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级新闻路线的破产
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，有如千钧霹雳，猛烈地炸开了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人把持的新闻界的反革命独立王国，震撼了中国的大地。中国赫鲁晓夫及其狐群狗党彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、周扬之流顿时乱了阵脚。为了挽救最后灭亡的命运，他们慌慌张张炮制了一个颠倒是非、混淆黑白、压制革命、包庇坏人的反革命《二月提纲》。他们施出一连串的阴谋诡计，继续控制报刊，妄图扑灭革命烈火，转移目标，掩护退却。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代的文献——五月十六日《通知》，给中国赫鲁晓夫们以毁灭性打击。毛主席号召全党高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，“彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。”一九六七年一月，上海《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派，奋起夺了党内一小撮走资派的领导权，首先从新闻界掀起了伟大的“一月革命”风暴。毛主席对《文汇报》的夺权给予极高的评价，他指出：这是一个大革命，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命。
    新闻战线同其他战线一样，文化大革命进入了向党内一小撮走资派展开夺权斗争的新阶段。中国赫鲁晓夫在新闻界的统治势力，全面崩溃了。那些什么《羊城晚报》《南方日报》之类放毒、造谣的旧报纸，一个一个被封了，被冲了，被革命派夺了权。好得很！好得很！这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    新闻战线十八年来尖锐激烈的阶级斗争，为我们提供了极其丰富、极其宝贵的经验教训。
    第一，坚定不移地、始终一贯地宣传毛泽东思想，是无产阶级报纸、广播、通讯社的根本任务。无产阶级报纸要把宣传毛泽东思想当作自己最神圣的职责。要努力把报纸办成一个学习、传播和普及毛泽东思想的大学校，要用毛泽东思想统帅新闻报道的一切方面，最迅速最准确地传达毛主席的声音，使毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众结合起来，成为自觉的行动，变为改造世界的无穷无尽的力量。宣传毛泽东思想必须准确。对于歪曲、篡改或违背毛泽东思想的一切言行，特别对于那种打着红旗反红旗的卑鄙做法，无论是来自右的方面，或是来自极“左”方面，都要坚决抵制，坚决反对，彻底批判。封锁毛主席的声音，这是所有反革命修正主义分子共同的卑鄙手段，我们的报纸，必须坚决反其道而行之。这样，报纸就能高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各个时期十分鲜明地为广大革命群众指出斗争的方向。
    宣传毛泽东思想，必须坚持同一切反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动思想进行针锋相对的斗争。在当前，我们要继续展开对国际上现代修正主义的大揭露、大批判。要进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线，批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，批判山头主义、宗派主义、个人主义等等资产阶级反动世界观的各种表现，批判一切反无产阶级的反动论点。破字当头，立在其中。毛泽东思想就是同形形色色资产阶级反动思想斗争中发展起来的。
    第二，在世界上存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸总是阶级斗争的工具。?这是毛主席对于报纸工作的基本观点。无产阶级要把报纸的领导权掌握在自己的手中，使之成为无产阶级专政的工具，资产阶级也力图夺取报纸的领导权，使之成为颠覆无产阶级专政的工具，这是十八年来我国新闻战线上两个阶级斗争的焦点。无产阶级革命派夺权之后，这个斗争并没有结束，那些资产阶级代表人物仍然会以种种卑劣手段，阴谋同无产阶级争夺新闻事业的领导权。因此，认真地清理阶级队伍，清除一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务、反动文人和地、富、反、坏、右分子，是当前新闻界的一项重要的工作。只有做好这一工作，才能树立起无产阶级的新闻队伍，才能在组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。各级新闻单位，都要建立一个革命化的、朝气蓬勃的、战斗的领导班子，要大胆提拔一批无产阶级的新生力量，以保证我国新闻事业的领导权牢牢掌握在忠于毛泽东思想、突出无产阶级政治、有革命干劲的无产阶级革命派手中。要注意人是会变化的，必须经常清洗那些腐化分子，不让他们掌握报纸、新闻的工具。
    第三，必须深入地持久地批判反动的资产阶级新闻路线，全面地肃清其毒害，把新闻界两条路线的斗争进行到底。在当前，除了从历史上全面批判资产阶级新闻路线外，要特别注意批判那种把新闻工具当作只为某一资产阶级、小资产阶级派别服务的极端错误的作法。各地报纸、电台等等必须坚决执行毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，批判资产阶级自由主义。一小撮阶级敌人，为了挽救他们的失败，不择手段地造谣诬蔑，制造“小道消息”，散布种种流言蜚语，妄图以假乱真，把水搅浑，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。对于这种反革命活动，我们要坚决揭露，坚决打击。广大的革命群众，要善于在复杂的阶级斗争中辨别真伪，识破敌人的阴谋诡计。我们队伍中也还有一些同志，从小山头的私利出发，或者对无产阶级司令部的指示断章取义，各取所需，发表耸人听闻的消息和图片，以制造某种舆论；或者不顾大局，不顾无产阶级的利益，肆意发表各种资料、文件，严重泄露了党和国家的机密：这些都是十分错误的，是资产阶级新闻路线的流毒在文化大革命中的恶劣表现，必须坚决加以纠正。毛主席告诫我们：“报上的宣传要看对人民有利无利”。?
  “说话，写文章都力求合乎敌人、帝国主义的口味，这是欺骗群众，其结果是敌人舒服，而自己的阶级被蒙蔽了。”奉劝那些中了资产阶级新闻路线的毒而至今尚不觉悟的人们，好好读读毛主席的这一伟大教导。
    毛主席的《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》，毛主席历来对新闻工作的一系列指示，是我们无产阶级办报纸、办广播、办通讯社、办一切新闻事业的唯一正确的指针，也是批判反动的资产阶级新闻路线的强大武器。我们要在行动上坚决贯彻执行毛主席的新闻路线，树立无产阶级严肃的科学的战斗的作风。
    第四，新闻机关要走精兵简政的道路，要坚决贯彻群众路线，密切联系工人阶级和劳动群众。
    毛主席教导我们：办好报纸的根本问题是报社人员的思想革命化问题。?“报社的人应经常到下边去，呼吸新鲜空气，不要长住北京。下去的人，又做工作，又当记者。”?
    毛主席又说：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”?
    毛主席最近又一次指出：“不应当关门办报，应面向群众，又要有大方向，又要新鲜活泼。”
    一切新闻机关，都要坚决遵照毛主席的伟大教导，勇敢地从各种旧框框、旧习惯的圈子里跳出来，面向群众，实行精兵简政。
    办报纸、刊物要那么多人干什么？必须精兵简政，必须加强新闻工作者同群众的联系，必须来一个大革命，彻底改变那种轻视工农、关门办报的资产阶级老爷作风，更好地贯彻执行毛主席的群众办报路线。精兵简政是当前办好无产阶级报纸的一项十分重要的组织保证。应当吸收有无产阶级觉悟的有生产实践经验的工人到报社中来，大量培养不脱离生产的工农通讯员，打破知识分子成堆的状况。
    做新闻工作的人，一定要到工农兵群众中去，一定要同劳动人民结合，一定要站在无产阶级立场上进行充分的调查研究，一定要善于及时反映革命群众中的先进的典型事物，反映无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民前进的呼声，一定要贯彻毛主席历来教导我们的从群众中来、到群众中去、集中起来、坚持下去的路线。不解决这个问题，是办不好无产阶级报纸的，是很容易丧失领导权的。这个问题，尚须进一步解决。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，把新闻战线上的大革命进行到底！注释：
