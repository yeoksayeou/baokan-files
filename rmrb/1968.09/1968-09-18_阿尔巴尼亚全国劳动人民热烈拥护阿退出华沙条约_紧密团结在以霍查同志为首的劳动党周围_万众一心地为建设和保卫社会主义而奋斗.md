The broad masses of workers and peasants throughout Albania warmly support the report by Comrade Shehu condemning the Warsaw Pact and Albania's withdrawal from the pact, as well as the decree of the People's Assembly condemning and withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. They resolutely declare that they will unite more closely around the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, with one heart and one mind, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, and strive to build and defend socialist Albania.

In recent days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals throughout Albania have held meetings to seriously study and discuss Comrade Shehu's report and the decree of the People's Assembly. Many units have also sent letters and telegrams to the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, the People's Assembly, and the Council of Ministers, expressing their resolute support for the condemnation and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.

A worker at the Lushnje Brick and Tile Factory, Korresh, said, "We fully support the decree of the People's Assembly condemning the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact has become a pact of war and aggression, a tool in the hands of the Soviet revisionists. It is no different from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The entire staff of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory wrote in a letter to the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, "Our people do not recognize the spheres of influence of imperialist and revisionist great powers, and we are not afraid of bullying. We pledge to the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha to firmly carry out the Party's slogan of 'one hand holding a pickaxe, the other hand holding a gun,' overfulfill production tasks, and forever be revolutionary fighters and builders of socialism, resolutely smashing all the conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism." The workers of the "November 28" State Farm in Lushnje, in the machine repair shop, pledged to fulfill the tasks assigned by the Party and heighten their revolutionary vigilance, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other. They also expressed their determination to strengthen political and ideological work, better study the documents of the Party of Labour, and the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha. Nasibe Kapo, a worker at the Elbasan Tobacco Processing Factory, said, "We do not need such a bad pact as the Warsaw Pact. Our strength lies in the unity of the people around the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. We stand with the great Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world. No force in the world can intimidate us."

In the shooting range, Misli Vogli, a 60-year-old old militia member from the Sukth Agricultural Cooperative in Durres, taught his daughter how to aim and shoot. He said to his daughter, "Child, aim at the bullseye, hit the enemy in the heart!" After studying Comrade Shehu's report, he said, "I am an old man, but I can still use a gun. If the motherland needs me, I will hold the gun in my hand until my heart stops beating."

The Albanian People's Army naval forces stationed in Vlora, who had engaged in a sharp struggle with the Soviet revisionists led by Khrushchev, have been listening to and studying Comrade Shehu's report and the relevant documents of the People's Assembly on their ships in recent days. Naval officer Petrit Miftiu said, "Comrade Shehu's report reminds us of how the Khrushchev revisionists, like robbers, seized our submarines docked at the Vlora base and our warships docked at the Soviet port of Sevastopol. The deeds of the Soviet revisionist army are still fresh in our memory. But we revolutionary fighters have the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings in our hearts, knowing how to respond to the Khrushchevites. The struggle we waged to defend our base and warships is part of the great struggle our Party waged against Khrushchev revisionism, to defend the honor, dignity, and sovereignty of the motherland, and is part of the struggle of Marxism-Leninism against modern revisionism."

Albanian newspapers published editorials on September 15, warmly supporting the decree of the People's Assembly condemning and withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact.

The editorial of "Zeri i Popullit" said, "Our people withdrew from the Warsaw Pact from the correct Marxist-Leninist principles of our Party. Our people did this with a sense of great responsibility, to always honorably fulfill their national and international responsibilities. All working people highly evaluate this action of withdrawing from the pact, considering it a measure and decision related to the independence of the motherland, and a contribution of our Party to the international communist and workers' movement."

The editorial said, "Our people did not allow anyone to trade their freedom, fate, and future, no matter how they disguised themselves, or how powerful they were. When the Soviet Khrushchev revisionists and their followers, these false friends, tried to put a noose around the neck of our people behind their backs, when we found traitors and invaders with knives and other things in the coat of the Warsaw Pact, we denounced them as traitors to communism and threw the infamous rags of the Warsaw Pact in their faces. In this way, our people feel more secure. In this way, under the leadership of their glorious Party of Labour and the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, they feel themselves to be the sole and omnipotent masters of their own fate."

The editorial of "Zeri i Ushtrisë" said, "Our working people and all the officers and soldiers of the armed forces unanimously condemn the Warsaw Pact and support Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact."

The editorial pointed out, "The People's Republic of Albania has many loyal friends. Marching, fighting, and being vigilant side by side with the People's Republic of Albania are the 700 million Chinese people. We have a brotherly friendship with them. Standing shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces are our comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are achieving brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The peoples of all countries are with us, and all Marxist-Leninists and all revolutionaries in the world are with us."

The editorial said, "The decree withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact further arouses the revolutionary enthusiasm of our people and armed forces, further inspires them, further heightens their morale, optimism, and confidence in their own strength, and further strengthens their fighting spirit to fulfill the tasks set by the Party. All officers and soldiers of our armed forces will strive to achieve higher standards in military training, further revolutionize the troops, further strengthen war preparedness, and wage a more resolute struggle. We will further strengthen organization, discipline, vigilance, and combat readiness, always prepared to defend the motherland."

    阿尔巴尼亚全国劳动人民热烈拥护阿退出华沙条约
    紧密团结在以霍查同志为首的劳动党周围  万众一心地为建设和保卫社会主义而奋斗
    广大群众纷纷向劳动党和霍查同志保证，坚决执行党的“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”战斗口号，永远作革命的战士、社会主义的建设者，同中国人民和世界革命人民一起，粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的一切阴谋
    新华社地拉那十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国广大劳动人民热烈拥护谢胡同志关于谴责华沙条约和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出这个条约的报告以及人民议会关于谴责和退出华沙条约的法令，并坚决表示，要更加紧密地团结在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的周围，万众一心，提高革命警惕性，为建设和保卫社会主义阿尔巴尼亚而奋斗。
    连日来，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地广大工农兵群众、干部和革命的知识分子纷纷举行集会，认真学习和热烈讨论谢胡同志的报告和人民议会的法令。许多单位还写信和打电报给劳动党中央、人民议会和部长会议，表示坚决拥护谴责和退出华沙条约。
    卢什涅砖瓦厂工人科雷希说，我们完全拥护人民议会关于谴责华沙条约的法令。华沙条约已经变成了战争和侵略的条约，变成了苏修手中的工具。它同北大西洋公约组织毫无区别。地拉那拖拉机配件厂全体职工在给劳动党中央的信中说，我国人民不承认帝国主义和修正主义大国的势力范围，我们不畏强暴。我们向劳动党和霍查同志保证，坚决执行党的“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的战斗口号，超额完成生产任务，永远作革命的战士、社会主义的建设者，坚决粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的一切阴谋企图。卢什涅区“十一月二十八日”国营农场修机车间职工保证，全力完成党所交给的任务，并提高革命警惕性，一手拿镐，一手拿枪。他们还表示要加强政治思想工作，更好地学习劳动党的文件和霍查同志的著作。爱尔巴桑烟草加工厂女工纳西贝·卡波说，我们不需要象华沙条约这样的坏条约。我们的力量在于全国人民团结在以霍查同志为首的党中央的周围。我们同伟大的中国人民和全世界革命人民在一起。世界上没有任何力量能够吓倒我们。
    都拉斯区苏克特农业合作社社员、六十岁的老民兵米斯利·沃格利在射击场上教他的女儿练习打靶。他对女儿说：“孩子，要注意瞄准靶心，打在敌人的心眼里！”他在学习了谢胡同志的报告后说：“我是上了年纪的人了，但是还能使枪，如果祖国需要我，我将紧握手中枪，直到心脏停止跳动为止。”
    曾经同苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者进行过针锋相对斗争的阿尔巴尼亚人民军驻发罗拉的海军部队，连日来也在舰艇里收听和学习谢胡同志的报告以及人民议会的有关文件。海军干部佩特里特·米夫蒂乌说，谢胡同志的报告使我们回想起赫鲁晓夫修正主义者象强盗一样，抢走了当时停泊在发罗拉基地的我们的潜艇和停泊在苏联塞瓦斯托波尔海港的军舰。苏修军队的所作所为我们还记忆犹新。但是，我们革命战士心中有党和霍查同志的教导，懂得如何回答赫鲁晓夫分子。我们为保卫我们基地和军舰所进行的斗争，是我们党为反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、保卫祖国的荣誉、尊严和主权所进行的巨大斗争的组成部分，是马克思列宁主义反对现代修正主义斗争的一个部分。
    阿尔巴尼亚报纸十五日分别发表社论，热烈拥护人民议会关于谴责和退出华沙条约的法令。
    《人民之声报》的社论说，我国人民是从党的马克思列宁主义的正确的原则性立场出发退出华沙条约的。我国人民带着崇高的责任感这样做，以便始终光荣地履行他们的国家和国际责任。全体劳动人民都对退出这个条约的行动给予很高的评价，认为这是一个同祖国的独立有关的措施和决定，是我党对国际共产主义和工人运动的一种贡献。
    社论说，我国人民没有允许任何人拿他们的自由、命运和前途做交易，不管这个人怎样伪装，也不管他是多么庞大。当苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者这些假朋友企图背着我国人民在我国人民的脖子上套上圈套的时候，当我们人民在华沙条约的外套里面发现背信弃义之徒和侵略者的刀子和其他东西的时候，他们就把这些人斥为共产主义的叛徒，并把声名狼藉的华沙条约的破烂货扔在这些人面前。这样一来，我们人民就感到更加安全了。这样一来，在他们的光荣的劳动党和以霍查同志为首的党中央的领导下，他们感到自己是自己的命运的唯一的、全能的主宰者。
    《战士报》的社论说，我国劳动人民和武装力量全体指战员一致谴责华沙条约，一致赞同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约。
    社论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国有许多忠实的朋友。同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国并肩前进、战斗和警惕着的是七亿中国人民。我们同他们有着兄弟般的友谊。同我国武装力量并肩站在一起的是我们的战友中国人民解放军。七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军在毛泽东主席领导下正在无产阶级文化大革命中取得辉煌胜利。各国人民和我们在一起，世界上一切马克思列宁主义者和一切革命者和我们在一起。
    社论说，退出华沙条约的法令更加激起我国人民和武装力量的革命热情，更加鼓舞他们、更加提高他们的干劲、乐观主义和对自己力量的信心，更加增强他们的战斗精神，以实现党所提出的各项任务。我国武装力量全体指战员将为实现各项目标，在军训中取得更高指标，使部队进一步革命化，进一步加强战备，进行更坚决的斗争。我们将进一步加强组织纪律、警惕性和战斗性，时刻准备着保卫祖国。“
