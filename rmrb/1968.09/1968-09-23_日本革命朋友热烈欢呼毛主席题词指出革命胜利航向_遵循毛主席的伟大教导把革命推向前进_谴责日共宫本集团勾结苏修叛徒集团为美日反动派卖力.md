Japanese revolutionary friends warmly celebrate Chairman Mao's inscription pointing out the direction of revolutionary victory. Following Chairman Mao's great teachings to advance the revolution.

	Tokyo, September 22 (New China News Agency) - Tokyo: Japanese revolutionary leftists continue to celebrate the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese workers six years ago, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's important inscription as a great encouragement to the Japanese proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings to advance the Japanese revolution.

	The responsible person for the Japanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Left) in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Suzuki Tokio, said with great emotion: When I heard that the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, had inscribed a great inscription to Japanese workers on September 18, 1962, I felt extremely excited and moved. He said, Chairman Mao's inscription has given great encouragement and inspiration to us Japanese proletarian revolutionaries. At the same time, this great inscription not only has extremely important and far-reaching significance for the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people, but also for the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries in the world. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, and solve a series of strategic and tactical problems of the Japanese revolution from the specific conditions of Japan. Suzuki said, without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary practice. Through our study of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," we have come to realize: from the specific conditions of Japan, the most revolutionary class in Japan is the working class. If we adhere to the contemporary peak of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, firmly rely on the working class of Japan, establish a solid worker-peasant alliance, and unite all the masses that can be united, then we can achieve revolutionary victory.

	Japanese revolutionary leftist Kanazawa Koki said: Chairman Mao always believes in and supports the Japanese people. I feel the glory of living in the era of Mao Zedong and the mission that I must undertake. Currently, the Japanese people are establishing a proletarian party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology.

	Kanazawa expressed: We will study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to advance the Japanese revolution.

	September 21 (New China News Agency) - According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist) Kyogiku District Committee issued a statement on September 18, warmly celebrating the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese workers. The statement pointed out that Chairman Mao's important inscription is a precious gift to the Japanese revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's inscription has great significance for the Japanese people who are fighting day and night against imperialism and revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

	The statement condemns the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japan Communist Party for increasingly closely colluding with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and working hard for the American and Japanese reactionaries. The statement said: "Their counter-revolutionary and anti-people true colors have been exposed to more and more of the masses."

	The statement pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. As long as we truly combine the great Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubted. The statement concluded with a call: Long live the most powerful weapon of the proletariat—the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

	September 22 (New China News Agency) - Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party (Leftist) Fukuoka Prefectural Committee issued a written statement on September 21 to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the important inscription given by the great leader Chairman Mao to Japanese workers, and decided to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, and strive for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

	The written statement said: We will use the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and summarize the past struggles of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, and find policies and strategies suitable for the situation in Japan.

	The written statement said: Now we are working hard to analyze the various classes in Japanese society. This is also an important basis for determining the strategy and tactics of the Japanese revolution.

	The written statement said: Facing the glorious and serious task of the Japanese revolution, we are determined to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, further deepen into the struggle, conduct investigations and research in the struggle, and at the same time arm ourselves theoretically with the great Mao Zedong Thought to strive for revolutionary victory, step by step.

	The written statement said: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, restored capitalism, and attempted to dominate the world through Sino-American cooperation, exposing its ugly face of social imperialism. The Miyamoto revisionist traitor clique of the Japan Communist Party closely follows the Soviet revisionists and is rapidly sliding down the counter-revolutionary revisionist path of "peaceful revolution" and "parliamentarism."

	The written statement said: We firmly oppose American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, Japanese monopoly capital, and Miyamoto revisionism, adhere to the fundamental principle of the revolution that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and are determined to carry the anti-American patriotic struggle to the end and strive for the victory of the national democratic revolution.

    日共革命左派北海道岩见泽市负责人铃木时雄满怀激情地说：当我听到了全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席一九六二年九月十八日书赠日本工人的伟大题词发表时，心里感到无比兴奋和激动。他说，毛主席的这一题词，给我们日本无产阶级革命派以极大的鼓舞和激励。同时，这一伟大题词，不仅对于日本人民的革命事业，而且对全世界各国人民的革命事业，都具有极其重大而深远的意义。我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想运用到日本人民革命斗争的实践中去，从日本的具体情况出发，解决日本革命的一系列战略和策略问题。铃木说，没有革命的理论就没有革命的实践。我们通过对毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》的学习，使我们认识到：从日本的具体情况来看，最要革命的是日本的工人阶级。如果我们坚持当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想，坚决依靠日本的工人阶级，建立巩固的工农联盟，团结一切能够团结的群众，那么我们就能够取得革命的胜利。
    日本革命左派金泽幸雄说：毛主席永远相信和支持日本人民。我感到生活在毛泽东时代的光荣和要承担的任务。目前日本人民正在建立一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为统帅的无产阶级政党。
    金泽表示：我们要在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，推进日本的革命。

    声明谴责日共宫本修正主义集团日益紧密地勾结苏修叛徒集团，为美日反动派卖力。声明说：“他们反革命和反人民的真面目，已经被越来越多的人民群众所识破。”
    声明指出，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。只要把伟大的毛泽东思想同日本革命的具体实践真正结合起来，日本革命的胜利，就是毫无疑义的。声明最后高呼：无产阶级最强大的武器——战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：日本共产党（左派）福冈县委员会为庆祝伟大领袖毛主席书赠日本工人的重要题词六周年，二十一日发表书面谈话，决心遵循毛主席的伟大教导，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践相结合，去争取日本革命的胜利。
