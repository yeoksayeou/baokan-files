The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang love the great leader Chairman Mao immensely. Throughout the entire autonomous region, from cities to rural areas, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, every village has a sign with Chairman Mao's quotations, and everywhere the bright song "The East Is Red" echoes. Broad masses of workers and peasants read Chairman Mao's quotations before going to work, practice them during production, and are determined to build the northwestern frontier of our motherland into a strong bastion against imperialism and revisionism.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 4th — The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, tempered by the great proletarian cultural revolution, love the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more deeply and loyally.

Throughout the entire autonomous region, from cities to rural and pastoral areas, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, every village has a sign with Chairman Mao's quotations, and everywhere the bright song "The East Is Red" echoes. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, say: "On the main road, Mao Zedong Thought signs are erected, and the revolutionary journey will not be lost." "In the tent, Chairman Mao's portrait is hung, and the poor herdsmen's hearts are bright day and night." "Wearing Chairman Mao's badge on the chest, revolutionary production is full of strength." A 90-year-old Uygur elderly woman in the southern countryside led her entire family to weave a large wall hanging with red flowers facing the sun, expressing the Uygur people's eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao. The Kazakh herdsmen on the Altai Grassland made a wheel of red sun from pine wood and placed it on the high mountain roads, symbolizing that Mao Zedong Thought's sunlight will forever shine on the pasture. The wool workers of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps used colorful woolen yarn, stitch by stitch, thread by thread, to weave a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, with blooming sunflowers embroidered below, indicating that the soldiers of the military farm at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains will forever follow the red sun, Chairman Mao. The border guards stationed on the Pamir Plateau brought wood from hundreds of miles away and stones from the high mountains to build a solemn Tiananmen Gate, expressing that the border guards guarding the western gate of the motherland are like guards in front of Tiananmen in the capital, guarding by Chairman Mao's side.

"The Tianshan Mountains are not as vast as the power of Mao Zedong Thought, the Ili River is not as long as Chairman Mao's kindness." The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They regard studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the first necessity of life. Broad masses of workers and peasants read Chairman Mao's quotations before going to work or to the fields, and practice them during production. They turn the production process into a process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and turn factories and fields into large classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In many villages, at night, every household has lights on, and the old and young study Chairman Mao's works together. In the summer pastures, herdsmen read Chairman Mao's instructions carefully under the light of bonfires and have lively discussions on their experiences in implementing them. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the autonomous region has never been as widespread and deep as it is today.

The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups have turned their profound proletarian feelings of loving Chairman Mao infinitely and their loyal hearts into conscious actions of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They act promptly and resolutely upon Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. During the proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups have greatly heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Some old miners, after fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, said, "In the past, we only knew that the coal mine is the darkest and the miner's lamp is the brightest; now we know that China's Khrushchev's heart is the darkest and Mao Zedong Thought is the brightest." A Uygur community member said, "There are many bitter things in the world, the bitterest is the old society where landlords, herdsmen, and capitalists oppressed and exploited us; there are many sweet things in the world, the sweetest is the socialist road guided by Chairman Mao; there are many poisonous things in the world, the most poisonous is the black hearts of China's Khrushchev and all class enemies. We must defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change." The broad masses of people's communes firmly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. From oases to grasslands, among the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, there are constantly emerging "new Yu Gong" who transform deserts, and "little eagles" who herd for the revolution.

The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, tempered by the proletarian cultural revolution, are determined to forever hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, advancing bravely on the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao. They are determined to further strengthen military-civilian unity and ethnic unity, and vow to build Xinjiang, located on the northwestern frontier of the motherland, into a strong bastion against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces of all countries, and to build the entire Xinjiang into a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

Kurban Tulum, a Uygur farmer from Yutian County, Xinjiang, who was honored to be received by the great leader Chairman Mao in 1958, shared with the youths the happy scene of seeing Chairman Mao then and vowed to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

    新疆各族革命人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    全自治区从城市到农村，家家悬挂着毛主席画像，村村树立着毛主席语录牌，处处响彻着《东方红》的嘹亮歌声。广大工农群众，上班前读毛主席语录，生产中用行动来实践，决心把祖国的西北边疆建设成为反帝反修的坚强堡垒
    新华社乌鲁木齐四日电　经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动锻炼的新疆维吾尔自治区各族革命人民，对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加热爱，更加忠诚。
    全自治区从城市到农村、牧区各族革命人民，家家悬挂着毛主席画像，村村树立着毛主席语录牌，处处响彻着《东方红》的嘹亮歌声。各族革命人民满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情说：“大路上树起毛主席语录牌，革命途中不迷航。”“帐篷里挂起毛主席像，贫苦牧民心里日夜亮堂堂。”“胸前戴上毛主席像章，革命生产浑身有力量。”南疆农村一位九十高龄的维吾尔族老太太，带领全家编织了一幅红花向阳的大壁毯，用来表达维吾尔族人民永远心向毛主席。阿尔泰草原上的哈萨克族牧民，用松木制成一轮轮红太阳，立在高山要道上，象征着毛泽东思想的阳光永远照耀着牧场。新疆军区生产建设兵团的毛纺工人，用各色鲜艳的毛纱，一针针，一线线，织成巨幅毛主席像，像下绣着朵朵盛开的葵花，表示天山脚下的军垦战士永远向着心中的红太阳毛主席。驻守在帕米尔高原上的边防战士，从几百里外运来木料，从高山上搬来石头，筑起庄严的天安门城楼，表示守卫祖国西大门的边防战士，就象警卫在首都天安门前，守卫在毛主席的身边一样。
      “天山再大，没有毛泽东思想的威力大，伊犁河再长，没有毛主席的恩情长。”新疆各族革命人民无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。他们把活学活用毛主席著作，当作生活的第一需要。广大工农群众，上班或出工前读毛主席语录，生产中用行动来实践。他们把生产的过程变成活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，把工厂和田间变成活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。许多农村，夜晚家家灯火，老少一堂，学习毛主席著作。夏季的牧场上，牧民们借着一簇簇篝火的亮光，细心阅读毛主席的指示，热烈地座谈贯彻执行的体会。全自治区活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，从来没有象今天这样广泛，这样深入。
    各族革命人民把无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，把无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，化为紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的自觉行动。他们对毛主席的最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，闻风而动，坚决执行。在无产阶级文化大革命中，各族革命人民大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。一些老矿工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线以后说，过去只知道煤窑最黑，矿灯最亮；现在知道中国赫鲁晓夫的心最黑，毛泽东思想最亮。维吾尔族社员说，世界上有很多东西是苦的，最苦的是旧社会受地主、牧主和资本家的压榨剥削；世界上有很多东西是甜的，最甜的是毛主席指引的社会主义道路；世界上有很多东西是毒的，最毒的是中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人的黑心。我们就是要誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变。人民公社广大社员坚定不移地沿着毛主席的革命路线，狠抓革命，猛促生产。从绿洲到草原，在各族革命人民中，不断涌现出改造戈壁的“新愚公”，成长起为革命放羊的“小山鹰”。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命千锤百炼的新疆各族革命人民，决心永远高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，沿着毛主席指引的社会主义大道奋勇前进。他们决心进一步增强军民团结，增强民族团结，誓把地处祖国西北边疆的新疆建设成为反帝、反修、反对各国反动派的坚强堡垒，把整个新疆建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一九五八年曾经光荣地受到伟大领袖毛主席接见的新疆于田县维吾尔族农民库尔班·吐鲁木，在向青年们讲述当年见到毛主席的幸福情景，决心一辈子紧跟毛主席干革命。
