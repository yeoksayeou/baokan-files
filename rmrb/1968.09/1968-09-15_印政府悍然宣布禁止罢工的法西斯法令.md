The Indian reactionary government brazenly announced a fascist decree on the 13th, banning strikes by workers in all important sectors such as national defense, postal services, railways, aviation, and docks.

According to reports, approximately four million central government employees across India planned to go on a 24-hour strike on the 19th of this month, demanding a guarantee of minimum wages and a halt to price increases. The Indian reactionary government's fascist decree threatens to impose fines and up to one year of imprisonment on those who violate the decree and incite strikes.

    印政府悍然宣布禁止罢工的法西斯法令
    据新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府十三日悍然宣布一项法西斯法令，禁止印度国防、邮电、铁路、航空和码头等一切重要部门的职工举行罢工。
    据报道，约四百万印度全国各地中央政府雇员，计划在九月十九日举行二十四小时罢工，要求保证最低工资和制止物价上涨。印度反动政府的这项法西斯法令扬言要对违反法令的罢工者和鼓动罢工的人判处罚款和一年以下徒刑。
