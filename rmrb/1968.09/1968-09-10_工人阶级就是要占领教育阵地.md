Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a propaganda team composed of the industrial working class has marched into the school gates in a grand manner, seized the educational front, and will forever lead the school. This is a momentous event, a revolutionary transformation. We enthusiastically applaud and cheer for this great revolutionary initiative!

The working class leads everything, the working class must lead the educational revolution, and lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure. This is a serious class struggle.

"Workers are taking our power." Who does "we" refer to? All students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are genuine revolutionaries welcome the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They are fighting with high spirits under the leadership of the working class to carry out the proletarian educational revolution and struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. For them, there is no question of having power taken away. Only the reactionary bourgeois intellectuals and reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" feel that their doom has arrived. For these gentlemen, we workers are indeed taking their power. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership from the working class, participation from the working masses, and coordination with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, together with the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, to implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination." We workers entering the school is precisely to carry out Chairman Mao's wise decision without any compromise, to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities," to take over the schools they have occupied, and to fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

From ancient times, this piece of land, the school, has been monopolized by the exploiting classes. After liberation, although it has improved somewhat, due to the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, it is basically still monopolized by bourgeois intellectuals. Our workers and poor peasants' children face various obstacles when entering school, while the children of landlords, rich farmers, and capitalists can freely come and go. Some workers and poor peasants manage to send their children to school, but after graduating from university, some people do not even want to enter their own home, let alone recognize their parents. They despise workers and peasants for being uncultured, say workers and peasants are unhygienic, and forget all about the essence of the laboring people, only thinking about fame and fortune, and not serving us workers and poor peasants at all. What use is such a school?

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Cultural Revolution sounded the alarm, and the broad masses of Red Guards revolutionary youngsters brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely attacked a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary forces in the schools. However, soon after, a handful of enemies of the proletariat began to stir again, gradually becoming active, attempting to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. They took advantage of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies within our ranks, secretly spreading reactionary bourgeois theories such as "multiple centers mean no center" and other fallacies, deceiving and winning over some people to establish large and small "independent kingdoms," openly opposing the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resisting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, sabotaging Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, refusing to carry out the orders of the proletarian headquarters, creating divisions, and waging "internal wars," turning a good school into a chaotic mess. The phenomenon of the bourgeois and proletariat vying for leadership is seriously present. The matter is so clear, we workers must seize this position, we must seize the leadership of the schools. We are a socialist country; if the workers do not seize the leadership of the schools, who will?

"Workers are oppressing the rebels." What nonsense! Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The Chinese working class, since the First World War, has begun to struggle consciously for China's independence and liberation." For decades, under the leadership of our vanguard—the Communist Party of China—and guided by the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, we Chinese working class have rebelled against all imperialists, rebelled against the Beiyang warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries, rebelled against the landlords and capitalists, and in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution, we have fiercely rebelled against a handful of capitalist roaders, seizing one great victory after another. Can the working class, which has always consciously struggled against all class enemies, not be the most resolute and thorough rebels? The "Sixteen Points" clearly state, "The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers... are the main force of this Cultural Revolution." Can the main force of the Cultural Revolution not be rebels, while some hypocritical verbal revolutionaries are considered rebels?

As for oppressing rebels, such people indeed exist. Chiang Kai-shek oppressed them, the Chinese Khrushchev oppressed them, and all capitalist roaders have oppressed them. But what happened to them? They all collapsed. Now, there is still a small handful of class enemies hiding in dark corners, spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, and inciting dissatisfaction with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, obstructing our activities in every way, and threatening to drive us out. Isn't this openly oppressing rebels? We workers know best who our enemies are and who our friends are. We will suppress our class enemies, we will suppress those who sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and we will protect the broad masses of the people, the Red Guards youngsters with glorious contributions. We workers' propaganda team entering the school is to suppress that small handful of class enemies, to protect the revolutionary teachers and students, and to protect the democratic rights of the revolutionary people. True proletarian revolutionaries will certainly feel proud and confident.

We advise those who do not study Chairman Mao's works well and have no class enemy awareness to take a good look at the situation and not to be fooled by the class enemies again!

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "How do you judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do you use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing and able to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and able to combine with workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise they are not revolutionary, or they are counter-revolutionary." All young people who want to be revolutionary should regard the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entering the school and forever leading the school as the greatest care and love from the great leader Chairman Mao.

Red Guards youngsters, the situation of the Cultural Revolution across the country is better than ever, a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation has arrived. Let us unite and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution!

### 工人阶级就是要占领教育阵地

    工人阶级就是要占领教育阵地
    驻沈阳冶金机械专业学校工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    在伟大统帅毛主席的最新指示指引下，一支由产业工人大军组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡地开进了学校的大门，占领了教育阵地，并将永远领导学校。这是惊天动地的大事，是翻天覆地的变革。我们为这一伟大的革命创举热烈欢呼，拍手叫好！
    工人阶级领导一切，工人阶级要领导教育革命，领导上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    “工人夺我们的权来了。”“我们”指的是谁？一切学校的学生、教员和工人中那些真正的革命者，他们对工人毛泽东思想宣传队是热烈欢迎的。他们正在工人阶级领导下斗志昂扬地进行无产阶级教育革命，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而斗争。对他们来说，根本不存在被夺权的问题。只有那些反动资产阶级知识分子和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”们才感到末日来临。对于这些先生们，我们工人阶级就是夺你们的权来了。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。”我们工人阶级进学校，就是为了不折不扣实行毛主席的英明决策，向一小撮党内走资派和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”夺权，把他们所盘踞的学校夺过来，完成毛主席交给我们工人阶级的光荣使命。
    从古以来，学校这块地盘，都是剥削阶级垄断的。解放后的十多年，虽然好了一些，但由于中国赫鲁晓夫的庇护，基本上也还是资产阶级知识分子所垄断。我们工人和贫下中农的子女进学校受到种种阻挠，而地主、富农、资本家的子女却自由出入。有的工人和贫下中农好容易把子女送进去，可是，读完了大学，有的人就连自己的家门也不愿进，连爹娘也认不得了。他们嫌工人农民土气，说工人农民不卫生，把劳动人民的本色忘得一干二净，一心想着名利地位，根本不为我们工人、贫下中农服务。这样的学校有什么用？
    在毛主席的英明领导下，无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，广大红卫兵革命小将奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，大造党内一小撮走资派的反，给学校的资产阶级反动势力一次沉重的打击。但是，随后不久，一小撮无产阶级的敌人又蠢蠢欲动，逐渐活跃起来，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们利用我们队伍中的某些人的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，暗中散播反动的资产阶级“多中心即无中心论”和什么别的谬论，蒙蔽和拉拢一些人建立起大大小小的“独立王国”，公然与毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部相对抗，抵制活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，拒不执行无产阶级司令部的号令，制造分裂，大打“内战”，把个好端端的学校搞得乌烟瘴气。资产阶级与无产阶级争夺领导权的现象严重地存在着。事情是这样地明明白白，我们工人阶级必须把这个阵地夺过来，必须把学校的领导权掌握在工人阶级手里。我们是社会主义国家，学校的领导权我们工人阶级不掌，谁掌？这个天下我们坐定了。
    “工人压造反派来了。”这是什么话！伟大领袖毛主席说：“中国工人阶级，自第一次世界大战以来，就开始以自觉的姿态，为中国的独立、解放而斗争。”几十年来，我们中国工人阶级在自己的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉指引下，造了一切帝国主义的反，造了北洋军阀和蒋介石反动派的反，造了地主、资本家的反，近两年在文化大革命中，又大造了一小撮走资派的反，夺取了一个又一个的伟大胜利。难道一贯自觉地与一切阶级敌人斗争的工人阶级不是最坚决、最彻底的造反派？“十六条”清清楚楚地写着，“广大的工农兵……是这场文化大革命的主力军。”难道文化大革命的主力军不是造反派，而有些言行不一的口头革命派倒算是造反派？
    至于压造反派，这样的人确实是有的。蒋介石压过，中国赫鲁晓夫压过，一切走资派都压过，但是，他们怎么样了？一个个都垮了。现在也有那么一小撮阶级敌人，躲在阴暗的角落里，造谣生事，挑拨离间，煽起对工人毛泽东思想宣传队的不满情绪，百般阻拦我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队的活动，扬言要把我们撵出去。这还不是公开的压造反派！？我们工人阶级最清楚谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？我们对工人阶级的敌人是要镇压的，对那些破坏文化大革命的敌人是要镇压的，而对广大人民群众，对有着光荣贡献的红卫兵小将，我们工人向来是保护他们的，我们工人宣传队开进学校，就是要镇压那一小撮阶级敌人，保护广大革命师生，保护革命人民的民主权利。真正的无产阶级革命派，必然感到扬眉吐气。
    奉劝那些不好好学习毛主席著作，毫无敌情观念的人，还是好好看清形势为好，可不要再上阶级敌人的当了！
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”一切要革命的青年都应该把工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校，永远领导学校，看作是伟大领袖毛主席对自己的最大关怀、最大爱护。
    红卫兵小将们，现在全国无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，一个斗、批、改的新高潮已经到来，让我们团结起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
