Title: The Working Class Must Lead the Educational Revolution

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, to have the participation of the working masses, to cooperate with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The worker-propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Chairman Mao's instructions are a great strategic deployment to thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system and are the most magnificent program for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. Chairman Mao is supporting us, the working class. We must strive to make Chairman Mao proud. We must seize all the leadership powers in the schools, which have been monopolized by the bourgeois intellectuals, and permanently let the working class hold them.

The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the educational field, representing the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and the reactionary Kuomintang, are determined to oppose the leadership of the working class. They are extremely hostile and fearful of the working class leading everything, so they maliciously slander the working class as "unreliable," "not understanding education," and "lacking culture." Their intention is to let the bourgeois intellectuals rule the schools and cultivate successors for their restoration of capitalism.

Whether to rely on the proletariat or the bourgeoisie in education is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a struggle for leadership and a fundamental issue of cultivating successors for which class.

If the bourgeois intellectuals rule the schools, they will inevitably use the bourgeois worldview to corrupt our next generation. Isn't it common to see that those who study agriculture cannot farm, and those who study electricity cannot install lights? Even more frightening is that these students who come out of the schools have no real skills but look down on the working class, despise the laboring people, and despise physical labor. They do not want to do hard, dirty work, and they do not want to be technicians or work in offices. Aren't there many such examples? The bourgeois intellectuals also use various systems to oppress workers and children of poor peasants. The examination system is like a sieve, sifting out our workers and children of poor peasants. The right of workers, peasants, and their children to receive education has been stripped away by the bourgeois intellectuals. Isn't this the bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat? What use does such education have for us, the proletariat, and for our socialist cause? It has no use at all, and it is even harmful. We, the proletariat, firmly reject such education and firmly reject the bourgeois intellectuals running the education. The proletarian education must be run by us, the proletariat.

The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents say we "do not understand education," which is pure slander. We, the proletariat, understand proletarian education the best, and we know best how to cultivate our own successors. The revolutionary teachers and students of Shijingshan Middle School responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "also learn from workers" and came to our workshop. Based on Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," we firmly grasp class education and open classes on class education and Mao Zedong Thought for them. We tell the students the bitter family histories of our past sufferings, letting them know how we were once like cattle and horses, suffering from the exploitation and oppression of landlords and capitalists. We must remember the class bitterness and never forget the blood debt, so that the younger generation can deepen their hatred for landlords, the bourgeoisie, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and love Chairman Mao more. They will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become good soldiers of Chairman Mao. When some students lack enthusiasm for safety classes, we tell them the past scenes of workers freezing and starving, being beaten by labor traitors, so that they understand that safety classes are given by Chairman Mao. One safety class increases one's affection for Chairman Mao. When we see students wasting national wealth, we tell them that national wealth is created by the laboring people, and destroying and wasting it is a crime against the laboring people. ...

The students labor, study, and fight with us. Under our education, they gradually overcome the erroneous ideas of despising workers and peasants and despising physical labor caused by the revisionist educational line. They do all the dirty, hard, and bitter work. Their skin tans, their thoughts become red, and their feelings get closer to ours. Seeing this, we are indescribably happy. Isn't this a sufficient proof that we understand proletarian education the best?

The working class "lacks culture" is a slogan used by the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents to oppose the working class occupying the educational front. This is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary argument. Who really lacks culture? Culture has always been created by the laboring people, and the laboring people are the masters of culture. We have rich practical experience from the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Just take our workshop as an example; every technological innovation is created by us, the working class. Which technological innovation or invention is created by the bourgeois technical "authorities"? We, the working class, are guided by Mao Zedong Thought, have the red sun Mao Zedong in our hearts, and have unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. We can create any miracle in the world. Those who only know how to recite some texts but do not understand practice are the ones who truly lack culture.

Chairman Mao supports us, and we must strive to make Chairman Mao proud. In the future, we must better study Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve our political consciousness, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and seriously do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks. We must firmly grasp the educational power, lead the educational revolution well, and strive to complete the great historical tasks entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. Let the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents tremble before us!

    工人阶级就是要领导教育革命
    北京首钢建筑公司预制车间革命领导小组
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席的这一教导是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的伟大战略部署，是进行无产阶级教育革命最宏伟的纲领。毛主席给我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气。我们一定要把被资产阶级知识分子所垄断的学校的领导大权统统夺过来，永远由工人阶级来掌握。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人这伙地主阶级、资产阶级、国民党反动派的代表，反动的阶级本性决定了他们对工人阶级领导一切十分仇恨，十分害怕，于是就大肆污蔑工人阶级“不能依靠”、“不懂教育”、“没有文化”。其用心就是要让资产阶级知识分子统治学校，为他们复辟资本主义培养接班人。
    办教育是依靠无产阶级还是依靠资产阶级，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是争夺领导权的斗争，是关系到为哪个阶级培养接班人的根本问题。
    资产阶级知识分子统治学校，就必然用资产阶级世界观来改造我们的后一代，结果是毒害了我们的后一代。学农业的不会种地，学电工的不会安装电灯，这样的笑话不是到处都有吗？更可怕的是这些由学校里出来的学生，没有什么真本领，却看不起我们工人阶级，轻视劳动人民，轻视体力劳动，不愿干累活、脏活，不当技术员、不到科室工作就不干，这样的例子难道还少吗？资产阶级知识分子还用名目繁多的制度来迫害工人、贫下中农子女，考试制度就象过筛子，考来考去就把我们工人、贫下中农子女给筛掉了。工人、农民及其子女上学受教育的权利被资产阶级知识分子剥夺了，这难道不是资产阶级对无产阶级实行专政吗？这样办教育对我们无产阶级，对我们社会主义事业到底有多大的用处？一点也没有用，而且还有害。我们无产阶级坚决不要这样的教育，坚决不要资产阶级知识分子来办教育。无产阶级的教育必须由我们无产阶级自己来办。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人说我们“不懂教育”，这纯是污蔑。我们无产阶级最懂得无产阶级教育，我们最知道如何培养自己的接班人。石景山中学革命师生响应毛主席“也要学工”的伟大号召，来到我们车间。我们根据毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级教育，为他们开设阶级教育课，开设毛泽东思想课。我们把一本本苦难家史讲给学生听，让他们知道我们过去是怎样做牛做马，受地主、资本家剥削压迫的，牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，这样就可加深年青一代对地主、资产阶级，对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的无比仇恨，使他们更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。当有的学生对上安全课缺乏感情时，我们就把过去工人阶级受冻挨饿、被工贼拳打脚踢的情景讲给同学听，使他们懂得安全课是毛主席给我们的。上一堂安全课，增加一分对毛主席的感情。当看到学生有浪费国家财富的表现时，就告诉他们国家财富是劳动人民创造的，破坏它，浪费它，就是对劳动人民的犯罪……。学生和我们一起劳动、一起学习、一起战斗，在我们的教育下，逐步克服了修正主义教育路线造成的轻视工农，轻视体力劳动的错误思想。脏活、累活、苦活他们都干了。他们的皮肤晒黑了，思想炼红了，和我们的感情也接近了。看到这些，我们心里有说不出的高兴。这不是充分说明我们最懂无产阶级教育吗？
    工人阶级“没有文化”，这是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，反对工人阶级占领教育阵地的一个招牌。这是地地道道的反革命论调。试问到底谁没有文化？历来文化都是劳动人民创造的，劳动人民才是文化的主人。我们有阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的丰富的实践经验。就拿我们车间来讲，每一项技术革新都是由我们工人阶级创造的，有那一项技术革新，那一项发明创造是资产阶级技术“权威”创造的？我们工人阶级有毛泽东思想指导，有我们心中的红太阳毛主席领航，有对毛主席的无限忠心，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来。那些只会背些条文而不懂实践的人，才是真正没有文化的人。
    毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定为毛主席争气。我们今后一定要更好地学习毛泽东思想，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，深入开展革命大批判，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，搞好斗、批、改。牢牢掌握好教育大权，领导好教育革命，为完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史任务而奋斗。让中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在我们面前发抖吧！
