To counter the monopolistic bourgeoisie's intensified exploitation and oppression of workers, British automobile industry workers have been staging continuous strikes, seriously disrupting the production of automobiles, a major export commodity of Britain.

On the 24th, approximately 100 workers at the Gillingham Company, which produces brake systems for British automobile companies such as Ford and Jaguar, went on strike to protest the management's unreasonable rejection of their demand for a wage increase. These workers had previously staged an 18-day strike over a week ago.

On the 24th, 4,000 workers at Ford Motor Company's Dagenham factory announced their refusal to work overtime for the capitalists, expressing their support for the struggle of the Gillingham Company workers.

    英国汽车工业工人连续罢工
    据新华社伦敦二十四日电　为了反击垄断资产阶级加紧对工人进行残酷的压榨和剥削，英国汽车工业工人连续举行罢工，使作为英国主要出口商品的汽车的生产受到严重的打击。
    二十四日，为英国福特、贾格瓦等汽车公司生产制动器的杰林公司的大约一百名工人举行罢工，抗议资方无理拒绝他们提高工资的要求。这些工人在一个多星期以前曾举行了十八天的罢工。
    福特汽车公司的戴根纳姆工厂的四千名工人二十四日宣布拒绝替资本家加班加点，以表示对杰林公司工人斗争的支持。
