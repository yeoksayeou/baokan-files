It was already deep into the night. Workers from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Harbin River School, Lan Dexin and Li Chuanren, were still awake. They quietly walked down the corridor to check if the students were resting. Lan Dexin noticed a faint light coming from the crack in the door of Class 6703, indicating that the two "little painters" were working late again. He approached the door and saw the two "little painters" drawing "The Crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's Bourgeois Reactionary Line" with intense hatred. This was their fifth night and day. Though both of their faces showed signs of fatigue, they exchanged smiles of satisfaction as they looked at the 110-plus drawings they had completed, criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. They shook hands tightly. Seeing this touching scene, Lan Dexin felt both joy and concern. He quickly pushed the door open. The two "painters" saw Lan Dexin and welcomed him enthusiastically.

The two "painters" were named Xu Li and Zhou Qingyu. Before the Cultural Revolution, they entered the school together, were assigned to the same class, and shared a dormitory, becoming closer than brothers. However, with the start of the Cultural Revolution, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the negative influences in society, these two close brothers joined different organizations in their class. Xu Li joined the "Hard-Boned" Combat Team, while Zhou Qingyu joined the "Fight to the End" Combat Team. Under the influence of bourgeois factionalism, the two organizations fought "internal wars" every day. Xu Li drew a "donkey head" for the "Fight to the End" team, and Zhou Qingyu drew a "rotten bone" for the "Hard-Boned" team, even hanging a piece of rotten bone on it. The more they drew, the more fiercely they fought, and the stronger the bourgeois factionalism became, making it a "persistent problem" for the entire school.

Recently, with the help of the military training team stationed at the school, the school revolutionary committee organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, consisting mainly of workers and including soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, to address the "persistent problem." The team followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on "realizing the proletarian education revolution, which must be led by the working class and must involve the participation of the working masses."

Old worker Lan Dexin came to Class 6703. Upon seeing the "rotten bone" drawn by the "Fight to the End" team and the "donkey head" drawn by the "Hard-Boned" team, he took serious note. He thought: Drawing is also a sharp weapon for carrying out revolutionary criticism and attacking the Chinese Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Drawing must express hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev. Even a small brush has issues of "line" and "principle"! Lan Dexin, through investigation, knew that these two children were both from poor peasant families, like bitter gourds on the same vine. He organized them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously and conducted a "bitter memories, sweet present" education, eliminating their misunderstandings. Afterward, they began to draw the family history of the old worker. The more they drew, the more they hated the old society, and the more they loved the new society.

Under the guidance of old worker Lan Dexin, Xu Li and Zhou Qingyu, with their deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, drew more and more, hating the Chinese Khrushchev more and more, and loving Chairman Mao more and more. The feelings between them became more intimate. Zhou Qingyu from the "Fight to the End" Combat Team said: "In the past, my pen served bourgeois factionalism all day, causing the two organizations in the class to fight 'internal wars' and not unite, which was truly wrong." Xu Li from the "Hard-Boned" Combat Team said: "In the past, my pen also served bourgeois factionalism, but now it must serve the revolution." Their views aligned, and the two decided to draw a series of cartoons titled "The Crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's Bourgeois Reactionary Line" to guide everyone in eliminating the influence of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The news of Xu Li and Zhou Qingyu working together spread like spring breeze throughout the entire Harbin River campus. Everyone praised the propaganda team for effectively solving the "persistent problem."

    两个小画家
    培忠兵　继月柱
    夜，已经很深了。哈尔滨滨江航校工人毛泽东思想宣传队的老工人栾德欣和李传仁还没有睡，他们轻轻地走过长廊，看同学们休息了没有。栾德欣忽然发现六七○三班教室的门缝里透出一道道光亮，就知道两个“小画家”又在连夜奋战。他走到门边，只见两个“小画家”正以无比仇恨的心情合画《中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线罪行录》。这已经是第五个昼夜了。虽然两人的脸上都略挂一丝疲劳的神色，可当看到这画好的一百一十多张批判中国赫鲁晓夫的漫画时，互相发出会心的微笑，两只手再一次紧紧握在一起。栾德欣看到这般动人的情景，又高兴，又心疼，急忙推门进去，两位“画家”见了栾德欣，一起迎了上去。
    这两个“画家”一个叫徐立，一个叫周庆余。文化大革命以前，两人一同进校，分到一个班级，一个宿舍，真比亲兄弟还亲。文化大革命开始后，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线和社会上的不良影响，使这对亲如手足的阶级弟兄，参加了班上的两个组织。徐立参加了“硬骨头”战斗队，周庆余参加了“反到底”战斗队。在资产阶级派性的影响下，两个组织成天打“内战”。徐立给“反到底”画个“驴头”，周庆余给“硬骨头”画块“烂骨头”，还拣块烂骨头挂在上面。这样越画打得越凶，越画资产阶级派性越强，成了全校的“老大难”问题。
    前不久，校革委会在驻校军训队的帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的伟大教导，组织了以工人为主体的，有解放军战士参加的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入班级，解决“老大难”的问题。
    老工人栾德欣来到了六七○三班。他一到班上，“反到底”画的“烂骨头”，“硬骨头”画的“驴头”，引起了他的严重注意。他想：画画也是开展革命大批判、向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派进攻的锐利武器，画就要画出对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨。小小的画笔也有
  “纲”上“线”上的问题呀！栾德欣通过调查，知道这两个孩子都是出身贫农家庭，是一根藤上的苦瓜。于是组织他们认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，并对他们进行忆苦思甜教育，使他们两人消除了隔阂。随后，他们两人画起老工人的家史来了，越画对旧社会越恨，对新社会越亲。
    徐立和周庆余在老工人栾德欣的帮助下，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，越画对伟大领袖毛主席越爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，越画彼此感情越亲切。“反到底”战斗队的周庆余说：“过去我这支笔整天为资产阶级派性效劳，弄得班上两个组织整天打‘内战’，联合不起来，真不应该。”“硬骨头”战斗队的徐立说：“过去我这支笔也是为资产阶级派性服务，现在一定要为革命服务。”看法一致了，两人决定画《中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线罪行录》的漫画，以此引导大家肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。
    徐立和周庆余团结合画的消息，如春风吹遍了整个滨江校园。大家都为宣传队善于解决“老大难”的问题拍手叫好。
