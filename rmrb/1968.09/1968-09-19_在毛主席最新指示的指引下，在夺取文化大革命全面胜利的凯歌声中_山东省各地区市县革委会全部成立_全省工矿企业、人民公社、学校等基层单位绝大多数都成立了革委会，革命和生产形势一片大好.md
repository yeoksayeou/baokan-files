Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, amidst the victorious songs of seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary committees have been established in all regions, cities, and counties of Shandong Province. The vast majority of basic units in the province's industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, and schools have also established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary and production situation in the province is excellent.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 18th, under the brilliant illumination of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, amidst the victorious songs of seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary committees have been established in all nine regions, four cities, and 112 counties of Shandong Province. The vast majority of industrial and mining enterprises, rural people's communes, and schools in the province have also established revolutionary committees. The establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels in Shandong Province marks the province's Cultural Revolution entering the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the province. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The establishment of revolutionary committees in all regions, cities, and counties of Shandong Province is the result of the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the province, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. After Chairman Mao issued the instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the broad revolutionary masses, especially the working class, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," resolutely implemented it. The province's industrial and mining enterprises, rural areas, government agencies, and schools quickly saw a high tide of revolutionary unity. This created the conditions for the widespread establishment of revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao taught: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the KMT reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, leading the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses in the province to engage in a head-on struggle with a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the party, smashing the enemies' various plots to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and eliminating interference from the right and the ultra-left, powerfully promoting the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels.

To better implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, in February and March of this year, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a conference of representatives of the revolutionary cadres of the province, followed by three consecutive conferences of regional and municipal revolutionary committee leaders. These conferences carried forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, advancing the attendees on the road of thought revolutionization. In recent periods, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Shandong Province have mobilized the masses to concentrate their firepower in criticizing the reactionary bourgeois "theory of multiple centers is no center," further raising the political awareness of the broad revolutionary masses.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong Province have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the leftist broad masses," holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely linking with the masses, and in the "three supports, two militaries" work, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses. They braved the severe cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer, traversing mountains and rivers, undeterred by wind and rain, insisting on timely delivering Chairman Mao's latest instructions to cities, towns, and remote mountain areas throughout the province, powerfully promoting the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels, and achieving new merits in the struggle to seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in Shandong Province is excellent. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the province has entered a new stage, with various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread throughout the province's cities and countryside. In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses have carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through criticizing and repudiating revisionism, the broad revolutionary masses have greatly promoted thought revolutionization. The revolution has powerfully promoted the development of production.

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Shandong Province are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, unify thoughts, steps, and actions, fully play the leading role of the working class, seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    在毛主席最新指示的指引下，在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中
    山东省各地区市县革委会全部成立
    全省工矿企业、人民公社、学校等基层单位绝大多数都成立了革委会，革命和生产形势一片大好
    据新华社济南十八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，山东省九个地区、四个市和一百一十二个县全部成立了革命委员会。全省工矿企业和农村人民公社以及学校等基层单位，绝大多数也都成立了革命委员会。山东省各级革命委员会的普遍建立，标志着山东省无产阶级文化大革命在全省范围内进入了斗、批、改的阶段。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    山东省所有地区、市和县革命委员会的建立，是全省广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极落实毛主席一系列最新指示的结果。当毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的指示以后，广大革命群众特别是工人阶级，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，坚决贯彻执行。全省工矿企业、农村、机关、学校，很快出现了革命大联合的高潮。这就为普遍建立三结合的革命委员会创造了条件。
    毛主席教导说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”山东省革命委员会遵循毛主席的伟大教导，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，带领全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，同党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，展开了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种阴谋，排除了来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，有力地推动了各级革命委员会的建立。
    为了更好地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，今年二、三月间，山东省革命委员会召开了全省无产阶级革命派代表会议，以后又连续召开了三次地区、市革委会负责人会议。这些会议发扬了毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，使到会的同志在思想革命化的道路上前进了一步。最近一个时期，山东省各级革命委员会又发动群众集中火力狠批了反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，进一步提高了广大革命群众的政治觉悟。
    驻山东省的人民解放军广大指战员，坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，密切联系群众，在“三支”“两军”工作中，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众。他们不顾深冬严寒和盛夏酷热，跋山涉水，风雨无阻，坚持把毛主席的最新指示及时传送到全省城镇、乡村和偏僻的山区，有力地促进了各级革命委员会的建立，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，立下了新功。
    目前，山东省革命、生产形势一片大好。全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动进入了一个新的阶段，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，遍布全省城乡。在学习班里，广大革命群众开展了忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动。广大革命群众通过斗私批修，大大促进了思想革命化。革命有力地促进了生产的发展。
    山东省各级革命委员会决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
