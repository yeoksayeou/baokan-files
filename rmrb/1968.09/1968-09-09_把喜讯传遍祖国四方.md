The good news is spreading across the Tian Shan Mountains, and the highlands of Tibet are singing songs of victory. The Beijing Telecommunications Building is filled with joy. The red communication warriors, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are all running around telling each other, each bursting with joy. They hold the red treasure book, shout with all their hearts, sing with all their might, and wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

The red communication warriors on the front lines of production, with hearts full of joy and a high sense of political responsibility, are transmitting this heart-stirring good news to the world with the fastest speed and the best quality. They have taken various effective measures to overcome the difficulties of poor circuit conditions, working through the night to carefully record the historic telephoto images of the founding ceremony of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Then, with revolutionary enthusiasm, they promptly sent the precious photographs of the founding of the Revolutionary Committees of Tibet and Xinjiang to all parts of the country. The comrades fought continuously, quickly and accurately spreading the good news across the country. The telegraph operators and switchboard operators, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, used the nationwide red communication network to quickly and accurately transmit the congratulatory telegrams from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to the people of Xinjiang and Tibet to Urumqi and Lhasa. The service hall staff immediately used the broadcast to repeatedly announce this inspiring good news to the revolutionary masses waiting to make calls or send telegrams. Everyone together enthusiastically cheered for the realization of a red country (excluding Taiwan Province)! Cheered for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Cheered for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The Telecommunications Building was brightly lit all night. The revolutionary masses immediately organized discussions. Comrades could not contain their excitement and said: Chairman Mao leads us from victory to victory. We are so fortunate to grow up in the era of Mao Zedong. Comrades unanimously expressed: We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for the working class. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensure the power of postal and telecommunications, and firmly hold it in the hands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for generations to come. Let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, along with the red radio waves, spread quickly, accurately, and uninterruptedly across all of China and the world!
