The Chinese photo exhibition, jointly organized by the Fukuoka Prefecture (orthodox) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the West Japan International Trade Promotion Association, concluded successfully in Fukuoka City on September 1.

On the evening of September 1, a closing ceremony was held in the exhibition hall. The attendees read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao a long life.

This photo exhibition was held amid the flourishing anti-American patriotic struggle of the revolutionary people of Fukuoka. Since its opening on August 17, the exhibition has been warmly welcomed by the people of Fukuoka Prefecture, attracting over 300,000 visitors.

The exhibition featured more than 400 photographs, reflecting the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and the thriving anti-American just struggles of revolutionary people around the world. All visitors were deeply educated and greatly inspired.

A Japanese revolutionary who visited the exhibition said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao has tremendous international significance. It not only ensures that socialist China will never change color but also points out a future full of limitless hope for the revolutionary people of the world. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists, and the revisionist group led by Kyonben of the Japanese Communist Party."

A Japanese worker said, "To carry out a revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, has made the base of world revolution in China even more solid. I am determined to unite with the Chinese people and fight to the end against American imperialism, which is oppressing us."

A revolutionary youth from Fukuoka Prefecture said, "Seeing the victorious facts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made me love the invincible Mao Zedong Thought even more and feel more deeply the greatness of the revolutionary people of China."
