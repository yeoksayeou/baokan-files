Sri Lankan Communist Party General Secretary Samugathasan recently issued a statement to the press condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He called for the revolutionary forces in Czechoslovakia to repel the Soviet invasion, overthrow the revisionist clique in their own country, and return to the socialist path.

New China News Agency, Colombo, September 4 — Sri Lankan Communist Party General Secretary Samugathasan recently issued a statement to the press condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists and the Czechoslovak revisionists are all traitors who have taken the capitalist road and have no right to be called communists.

The statement said: "We condemn the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in collusion with the revisionist ruling cliques of Poland, East Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, for invading Czechoslovakia.

"The reactionaries of the world and their newspapers are using this situation as a stick to beat all communists and Marxist-Leninists. They are doing this with the simple trick of equating the modern revisionist ruling cliques with communists, completely forgetting and ignoring the well-known fact that these regimes have been traitors to Marxism-Leninism for more than a decade and have completely taken the road of capitalist restoration. Therefore, they have no right to be called communists."

The statement said: "In economic terms, the policies pursued by the modern revisionist ruling cliques are gradually leading to capitalist restoration, abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and replacing it with the dictatorship of a new privileged class that is determined to take the road of capitalist restoration. They encourage capitalist development in the countryside, doubling the size of private plots for collective farmers. They implement capitalist profit incentives in industry. Their economies are in disarray, even to the point of strikes. They allow international monopolists to set up factories in their countries, exploiting their labor.

"In cultural terms, they have opened the floodgates to all the decadent aspects of Western culture. Nightclubs, prostitution, tipping, the latest crazy dances from the West, beauty pageants, miniskirts, Beatles-style haircuts—all these have become popular in the countries ruled by revisionists (including Czechoslovakia before Dubček came to power)."

The statement pointed out: "The Soviet Union is not a socialist country, nor is Czechoslovakia. Both countries are on the road to capitalist restoration. The only difference between Novotný and Dubček is that the former is willing to take the road of capitalist restoration under the protection of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, while the latter wants to independently and more quickly embrace U.S. imperialism."

The statement pointed out: "This is where the seeds of conflict lie—whether Czechoslovakia wants to stay within the Soviet sphere and move towards capitalism, or whether it can, like the Soviet Union itself, independently do business with U.S. imperialism and West Germany. This is also the contradiction between the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism. These two forces are both colluding with each other and fighting each other. Both sides want to be the dominant partner and are busy establishing their own spheres of influence in the manner of true bandits."

The statement said: "The Soviet revisionists claim that they invaded Czechoslovakia to defend Czechoslovakia's 'socialist achievements' and 'socialist unity.' This is a big joke and hypocrisy. There is no socialism to defend, and there is no socialist unity to defend.

"Dubček's so-called liberalization program is actually to give the bourgeoisie and other reactionary forces more freedom, so that capitalism can be quickly restored. The abolition of press censorship simply means that the bourgeoisie and other reactionary forces will have the freedom to propagate their views."

The statement pointed out: "Dubček is attempting to implement bourgeois democracy in Czechoslovakia, which is opposed to socialist democracy. Socialist democracy can only exist under the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, this is a more complete democracy because it is democracy for the working class and all laboring people, who make up the majority in any country. Similarly, socialist democracy cannot coexist with bourgeois democracy. Democracy for the laboring people, dictatorship over the exploiting classes—that is socialist democracy. It must be this way."

The statement finally hopes that the revolutionary forces in Czechoslovakia will rise up to repel the Soviet invasion and overthrow the revisionist clique in their own country, returning to the socialist path.

    锡共总书记桑穆加塔桑发表声明
    谴责苏修出兵侵略捷克斯洛伐克
    希望捷克斯洛伐克革命力量起来击退苏修侵略，推翻本国修正主义集团，重新走社会主义道路
    新华社科伦坡四日电　锡兰共产党总书记桑穆加塔桑最近对报界发表声明，谴责苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克，指出苏修、捷修等都是叛徒，都走上了资本主义道路，他们没有任何权利被称为共产党。
    声明说：“我们谴责苏修统治集团伙同波兰、东德、匈牙利和保加利亚的修正主义统治集团对捷克斯洛伐克进行侵略。
    “世界各国的反动派和他们的报纸正在利用这一局势作为打击所有共产党人和马克思列宁主义者的棍棒。他们是用把现代修正主义统治集团同共产党人等同起来这个简单手法来这样做的，而完全忘记了，并且无视这样一个尽人皆知的事实：十几年来，这些政权已经变成了马克思列宁主义的叛徒，已经完全走上了资本主义复辟的道路，因此，他们没有任何权利被称为共产党人。”
    声明说：“在经济上，现代修正主义统治集团所奉行的政策，逐渐导致资本主义复辟，取消无产阶级专政，而代之以一心走资本主义复辟道路的新资产阶级特权阶层的专政。他们在农村鼓励资本主义的发展，把集体农民的自留地的面积增加一倍。他们在工业中实行资本主义利润刺激。他们的经济发生了脱节，甚至发生了罢工。他们允许国际垄断资本家在他们的国家里开设工厂，剥削他们的劳动力。
    “在文化上，他们为西方文化的一切腐朽的东西打开了闸门。夜总会、妓女、小费制度、从西方传入的最新式的疯狂舞蹈、选美、超短裙、甲壳虫式发型——所有这些成了修正主义者统治的各国（包括在杜布切克上台之前的捷克斯洛伐克在内）流行的东西。”
    声明指出：“苏联既不是、捷克斯洛伐克也不是社会主义国家。这两个国家都在资本主义复辟的道路上走下去。诺沃提尼和杜布切克之间唯一不同的是，前者愿意在苏修统治集团的保护下走资本主义复辟的道路，而后者要独立地和更快地投入美帝国主义的怀抱。”
    声明指出：“这里头埋着冲突的种子——捷克斯洛伐克是不是想留在苏联的范围里走向资本主义，或者它是不是能够象苏联自己所做的那样，独立同美帝和西德做交易。这也就是苏修和美帝之间的矛盾。这两股势力一面互相勾结，一面又互相斗争。两方都想当能够支配对方的伙伴，并且以真正的强盗方式，忙于建立自己的势力范围。”
    声明说：“苏修说什么他们入侵捷克斯洛伐克是为了保卫捷克斯洛伐克的‘社会主义成果’和‘社会主义团结’，这是天大的笑话和虚伪。既没有什么社会主义要保卫，也没有什么社会主义团结要保卫。
    “杜布切克所谓的自由化纲领实际上是要给予资产阶级和其他反动势力以更多的自由，以便于资本主义迅速复辟。取消新闻检查制度只是意味着，资产阶级和其他反动势力将有自由来宣传他们的观点。”
    声明指出：“杜布切克企图在捷克斯洛伐克推行的是同社会主义民主对立的资产阶级民主。社会主义民主只有在无产阶级专政的条件下才能存在。但是这是更充分的民主，因为这是对在任何国家占大多数的工人阶级和全体劳动人民实行民主。同样，社会主义民主不能同资产阶级民主并立。对劳动人民实行民主，对剥削阶级实行专政——这就是社会主义民主。只能是这样。”
    声明最后希望捷克斯洛伐克的革命力量起来击退苏修的侵略，并推翻本国的修正主义集团，重新走上社会主义道路。
