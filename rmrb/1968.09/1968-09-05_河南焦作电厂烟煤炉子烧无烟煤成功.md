The revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres of Jiaozuo Electric Plant in Henan Province formed a "three-in-one" technical innovation team. They thoroughly repudiated the revisionist line on science and technology promoted by China's Khrushchev, and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian line on science and technology. They successfully achieved the major innovation of "burning anthracite in bituminous coal furnaces."

The success of converting bituminous coal furnaces to burn anthracite has greatly promoted the technical innovation movement at Jiaozuo Electric Plant. This year, the plant has successively achieved major technical innovations such as "fly ash reburning in boilers," "circulation water treatment for flue gas," and "automatic ash removal for boilers." The workers say, this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties, and production will leap forward.

    河南焦作电厂烟煤炉子烧无烟煤成功
    河南省焦作电厂的革命工人、革命技术人员和革命干部组成“三结合”的技术革新小组，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义科技路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级科技路线，实现了“烟煤炉子烧无烟煤”的重大革新。
    烟煤炉改烧无烟煤的成功，极大地推动了焦作电厂的技术革新运动。今年以来，这个厂又先后实现了“锅炉飞灰复燃”、“炉烟循环水处理”和“锅炉除灰自动化”等重大技术革新。工人们说，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，有了毛泽东思想，我们就能战胜一切困难，生产就会飞跃发展。
