	South Yemen Implements Currency Reform
	Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: A report from Aden states that the People's Republic of South Yemen has recently announced a new currency law, implementing currency reform.

	According to the new currency law, South Yemen's currency, the dinar, will be backed by gold and convertible currencies, rather than solely by the British pound. The Middle East News Agency reports that South Yemen's Foreign Minister Zalay said that this measure aims to reduce South Yemen's dependence on the British pound as the sole backing.

	The Middle East News Agency states that South Yemen's President Shabi recently issued several decrees, which impose strict regulations on business registration, chambers of commerce, and currency exchange. Due to the instability and depreciation of the British pound, one of these laws stipulates an increase in the gold backing of the local currency, the dinar, and a reduction in the backing provided by the British pound.

    南也门实行货币改革
    新华社十八日讯　亚丁消息：南也门人民共和国最近宣布了新的货币法，实行货币改革。
    根据新的货币法，南也门的货币第纳尔将以黄金和可兑换货币为保证，而不是以英镑作为唯一保证。据中东通讯社报道，南也门外交部长扎莱说，这一措施是为了使南也门减少把英镑作为唯一保证的依赖。
    中东通讯社说，南也门总统沙比最近颁布了一些法令，这些法律在商业注册、工商会和货币兑换方面规定了严格的限制。由于英镑地位的不稳和贬值，其中的一项法律规定增加当地货币第纳尔的黄金保证以及削减英镑的保证。
