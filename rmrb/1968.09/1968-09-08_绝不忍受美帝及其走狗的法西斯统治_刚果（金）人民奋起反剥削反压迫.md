Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The people of Congo (Kinshasa), with their glorious revolutionary tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, have never yielded to the Belgian colonialists in the past, and today they will never tolerate the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Mobutu. Apart from the patriotic armed forces continuing to wage armed struggle against the U.S.-Mobutu reactionary regime, the masses in the areas controlled by the Mobutu clique are also constantly engaged in struggles against exploitation and oppression.

At the beginning of this year, when U.S. Vice President Humphrey arrived in Congo (Kinshasa) for activities, Congolese patriotic students organized a massive demonstration. The demonstrators shouted slogans at this American plague, such as "U.S. murderers, go back!" and "Down with U.S. imperialism!" They also burned the U.S. flag on the spot to show their determination to fight U.S. imperialism to the end. On January 16, students in Kinshasa distributed leaflets exposing the true face of Mobutu, the henchman who murdered Lumumba, and dealt a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialist plot to dress up this running dog as the "successor" of Lumumba's cause. The patriotic actions of Kinshasa students were supported by students in other parts of Congo (Kinshasa).

The Mobutu clique, in order to suppress the increasingly high tide of patriotic student movements, forcibly disbanded the General Union of Congolese Students and threw the chairman of the union into prison. Subsequently, it attempted to establish a puppet student organization at the University of Lovanium, the most important university in Congo (Kinshasa), to control the patriotic activities of the students. This plot was strongly opposed by the students of Lovanium University. The students angrily drove out the "Minister of Education" who came to the university to implement this plot, and then the students hoisted a red flag high in the school, expressing their determination not to yield to the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Mobutu.

Congo (Kinshasa) workers, in order to resist the exploitation and oppression of the Mobutu puppet clique, have been continuously engaged in strike struggles. According to reports, after the workers of the Kinshasa Real Estate Company went on strike to demand wage increases and improved working conditions, thousands of workers at another textile factory, Lidexco, recently also went on a large-scale strike to protest the factory management's arbitrary dismissal of workers. In the province of Katanga, where workers are relatively concentrated, workers in some factories and mines also launched strike struggles. In addition, all teachers in Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga Province, went on strike in May to protest the Mobutu clique's criminal act of not paying salaries for several consecutive months. Recently, the people of Lubumbashi, the capital of Kasai Province, have been organizing continuous demonstrations to protest Mobutu's plot to conspire against the people there.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The biggest imperialism in the world today is U.S. imperialism, which has its running dogs in many countries. Those supported by imperialism are precisely those who are spit upon by the broad masses of the people." Under the strong opposition of the Congolese people, the days of the U.S. imperialist running dog Mobutu puppet clique are getting worse. As long as the Congolese people unite and persist in waging armed struggle and other forms of struggle, the Mobutu puppet clique will eventually be overthrown by the Congolese people.

    绝不忍受美帝及其走狗的法西斯统治
    刚果（金）人民奋起反剥削反压迫
    有压迫，就有反抗。具有反帝、反殖光荣革命传统的刚果（金）人民，过去从未在比利时殖民主义者面前屈服过，今天也绝不会忍受美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托的法西斯统治。除了爱国武装坚持开展反对美国—蒙博托反动统治的武装斗争以外，在蒙博托集团统治区内的人民群众也在不断进行反剥削、反压迫的斗争。
    今年初，当美国副总统汉弗莱到达刚果（金）活动时，刚果（金）爱国学生组织了声势浩大的示威。示威群众向这个美国瘟神高呼：“美国杀人犯滚回去！”“打倒美帝国主义！”等口号，并当场焚烧美国星条旗，表示他们同美帝斗争到底的决心。一月十六日，金沙萨的爱国学生散发传单，揭露美帝走狗蒙博托这个杀害卢蒙巴的刽子手的狰狞面目，有力地打击了美帝企图把这条走狗打扮成卢蒙巴事业的“继承人”的阴谋。金沙萨学生的爱国行动得到了刚果（金）其他地方学生的支持。
    蒙博托集团为了扑灭日益高涨的爱国学生运动，强行解散了刚果（金）学生总联合会，并且把总联合会的主席投进监狱。接着，它企图在刚果（金）最重要的洛瓦宁大学建立一个御用的学生组织，来控制学生的爱国活动。这一阴谋遭到洛瓦宁大学学生们的强烈反对，学生们愤怒地把跑到大学里推行这一阴谋计划的蒙博托的“教育部长”逐出了校门，随后学生们在学校内高高地升起一面红旗，表示他们不屈服于美帝及其走狗蒙博托的反动统治的决心。
    刚果（金）工人为了反对蒙博托傀儡集团的剥削和压迫，不断进行罢工斗争。据报道，继金沙萨房产公司的工人举行罢工要求增加工资和改善劳动条件之后，另一家利代克斯科纺织厂的几千名工人最近也举行大罢工，抗议工厂当局无理解雇工人。在工人比较集中的加丹加省，一些厂矿的工人也展开了罢工斗争。此外，加丹加省省会卢本巴希的全体教师在五月份进行罢教，抗议蒙博托集团连续几个月不发工资的罪恶行为。最近，开赛省省会路路阿堡的人民群众连续组织游行示威，抗议蒙博托到那里策划反人民的阴谋活动。
    伟大领袖毛主席英明指出：“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”在刚果（金）广大人民的强烈反对下，美帝走狗蒙博托傀儡集团的日子越来越不好过，只要刚果（金）人民团结起来，坚持开展武装斗争以及其他各种形式的斗争，蒙博托傀儡集团终将被刚果（金）人民所推翻。　（据新华社讯）
