	The People's Forum Exposes the Rahman Group's Plot to Murder Patriotic Youth in Malaya
	Calls for the People to Overthrow the Reactionary Regime and Strive for True Independence
	The People of Malaya Recognize the Need to Take Up Arms and Wage a People's War Through Arduous Struggle

	New China News Agency, September 13th: Singapore News: An article published in the Malayan newspaper "The People's Forum," which is printed in Singapore, exposed the recent plot by the American and British imperialists and their lackey, the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet group, to murder eleven Malayan patriotic youths. The article pointed out that the Malayan people, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely fought against the enemy and foiled their evil plot.

	The article stated, "Why does the Rahman puppet group, at this time, want to 'sentence' the eleven Malayan patriotic youths, who were arrested in the 1964 struggle against the new colonialism tool of American and British imperialism, 'Malaysia,' to death and make a big fuss about it? Why do they suddenly play the trick of 'pardoning'?"

	The article pointed out: On June 20, 1968, the 20th anniversary of the Malayan people's anti-British national liberation war, a stirring and inspiring tribute was received—from the People's Republic of China, a resolute and steadfast expression of support for the Malayan people. This shows that the 700 million people led by the great leader Chairman Mao of the People's Republic of China support the Malayan people, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, in their revolutionary struggle to smash "Malaysia," overthrow the reactionary rule of American and British imperialism and their lackeys, and strive for the true independence, unity, and democracy of Malaya. This telegram made the imperialist lackeys in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore tremble with fear.

	The article continued: The revolutionary situation in Malaya (including Singapore) is excellent. Armed with the most powerful Marxism-Leninism in the world and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Malayan people are bravely fighting under the great red banner of armed struggle. The Malayan National Liberation Army achieved brilliant results on June 17 of this year.

	The Malayan people have learned from their arduous experiences that they must take up arms and wage a people's war.

	The article stated, "On August 15, just the day before the Rahman puppet group shouted about 'executing' the eleven Malayan patriotic youths, the Malayan people, following Chairman Mao's great call: 'All the people of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, be brave and stand up for a just cause! Let nothing frighten us! Take a stand against oppression and let nothing frighten us! Advance wave upon wave! Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed.' In Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaya, they held grand demonstrations. The Rahman puppet regime, under the impact of the widespread indignation and deep hatred of the Malayan people, was terrified and the next day, in a hurry, announced a postponement of the 'execution.' The Malayan people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, won a great victory.

	The article pointed out: The puppets of American and British imperialism cannot stop the Malayan people's irresistible movement to achieve a truly independent, unified, and democratic Malaya. The article said: "In the glorious struggle to build a new Malaya, a Malaya without exploitation of man by man and oppression of man by man, the Malayan people are not alone. The 700 million Chinese people stand on our side, the world proletariat stands on our side, and truth is on our side. The Malayan people, armed with the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought, will surely achieve the final victory!"

    马来亚《人民论坛》揭露拉赫曼集团企图杀害爱国青年的阴谋
    号召人民推翻反动统治争取真正独立
    马来亚人民从艰苦斗争中认识到必须拿起枪杆子进行一场人民战争
    新华社十三日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《人民论坛》一日发表文章，揭露美英帝国主义及其走狗“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团最近阴谋杀害十一名马来亚爱国青年的罪恶行径。文章指出，马来亚人民按照伟大导师毛主席的教导，同敌人进行了英勇的斗争，粉碎了敌人的罪恶阴谋。
    文章写道，拉赫曼傀儡集团为什么在目前这个时候，要把在一九六四年马来亚和印度尼西亚人民反对美英帝国主义的新殖民主义工具“马来西亚”的斗争中被捕的十一位马来亚爱国青年“判处”死刑并大事渲染呢？为什么它们一会儿又耍出什么要实行“宽赦”的把戏呢？
    文章指出：在一九六八年六月二十日这个马来亚人民抗英民族解放战争二十周年纪念的日子，传来了令人鼓舞、振奋和无尚光荣的重要献词——来自伟大中华人民共和国的全力、坚决和忠实地支持马来亚人民的光辉贺电，这说明世界无产阶级伟大导师毛主席领导的中华人民共和国的七亿人民支持马来亚人民在马来亚共产党的领导下，开展粉碎“马来西亚”，推翻美英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，争取马来亚的真正独立、统一和民主所进行的革命斗争。这份贺电使得吉隆坡和新加坡的帝国主义的走狗们怕得要死。
    文章接着指出：马来亚（包括新加坡）的革命斗争形势大好。马来亚人民在全世界最强有力的马克思列宁主义和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的武装下，高举武装斗争的伟大红旗，进行着英勇的斗争。马来亚民族解放军在今年六月十七日取得了辉煌的战果。
    马来亚人民已从艰苦的经验教训中认识到必须拿起枪杆子进行一场人民战争。
    文章写道，八月十五日，就在拉赫曼傀儡集团叫嚣要“处决”十一位马来亚爱国青年的前一天，马来亚人民根据毛主席的伟大号召：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”在吉隆坡和马来亚其他地方举行了盛大的示威游行。拉赫曼傀儡政权在马来亚人民普遍愤懑和刻骨仇恨的冲击下，怕得要死，第二天，迫不及待地宣布暂缓“处决”。马来亚人民根据毛主席的教导获得了伟大的胜利。
    文章指出：美英帝国主义的傀儡们不可能阻止马来亚人民为实现一个真正独立、统一和民主的马来亚而开展的不可抗拒的运动。文章说：“马来亚人民在为建立一个新马来亚，一个没有人剥削人与人压迫人的马来亚的光荣斗争中，并不是孤立的，七亿中国人民站在我们这一边，全世界无产阶级站在我们这一边，真理在我们这一边。用战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的马来亚人民必定能取得最后的胜利！”
