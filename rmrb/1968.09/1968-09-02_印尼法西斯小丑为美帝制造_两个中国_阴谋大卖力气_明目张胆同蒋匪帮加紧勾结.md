According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the Indonesian fascist military regime, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, is increasingly tightening its collusion with the Chinese people's enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, brazenly serving the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

According to reports from the Chiang gang's newspapers at the end of July, the Indonesian fascist military regime has decided to send a five-person "trade delegation" to be stationed in Taipei. The members of the Chiang gang's "trade representative office" in Jakarta have also been determined and have received the "approval" of the Indonesian fascist military regime. According to reports from reactionary newspapers in Jakarta, the Chiang gang's "trade representative office" will soon be officially established in Jakarta, and "all difficulties have been resolved by both sides."

The so-called establishment of mutual "trade" representative agencies is essentially a major step for the Indonesian fascist military regime to establish "diplomatic relations" with the Chiang gang, and is another evil act of collusion in its pursuit of the U.S., conspiring to create "two Chinas." Over the past year, these two lackeys of U.S. imperialism have repeatedly clamored to "establish diplomatic relations as soon as possible." In March, after the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, declared himself "president," he immediately sent a delegation to Taiwan under the guise of "trade," engaging in counter-revolutionary dealings. The head of this delegation, Suhadi Man, openly called for strengthening cooperation with the Chiang gang to "advance towards establishing diplomatic relations." On the day before this "trade" delegation went to Taiwan, the Chiang gang's newspapers bluntly admitted that the "diplomatic relations" between the Indonesian fascist military regime and the Chiang Kai-shek gang would be established this year. Recently, the Chiang gang's newspapers and Indonesian reactionary newspapers revealed that the members of the "trade representative office" that the Chiang gang decided to send to be stationed in Indonesia are composed of the Chiang gang's "diplomats" and "special committee members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission." The Indonesian reactionary "trade representative office" stationed in Taiwan will "perform consular duties." It is clear that this is a cover-up by the Indonesian fascist military regime, using the establishment of a "trade representative office" to conceal its evil act of establishing "diplomatic relations" with the Chiang gang.

To curry favor with U.S. imperialism, the Indonesian fascist military regime has recently "enthusiastically received" one after another "delegation" from the Chiang gang under different banners. According to reports, a so-called "medical delegation" composed of eleven Chiang gang members stayed in Indonesia for ten days in July. The heads of the Indonesian fascist military regime's Department of Defense and Security, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Health, and the Marine Corps Commander all successively held "cordial talks" with this Chiang gang "medical delegation." According to reports from reactionary newspapers in Jakarta, the talks covered a wide range of issues, including "establishing diplomatic relations," opening the "Taipei-Jakarta route," cooperation between the Indonesian Navy and the Chiang gang in the "pharmaceutical industry," and collusion to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese. The head of the anti-Chinese organization under the Department of Defense and Security, the anti-communist general Sunaso, brazenly shouted at the "reception" of the Chiang gang's "medical delegation" on July 26: "I hope that the relationship between Taiwan and Indonesia will be even closer in the future," and that the era of establishing "diplomatic relations" will "return." According to broadcasts from Jakarta Radio, the Indonesian fascist military regime's Minister of Health, Sivabesi, "happily accepted" the Chiang gang's "medical delegation's" formal invitation to visit "Taiwan."

While "inviting" the Chiang gang's "medical delegation" to Indonesia to engage in evil activities, the Indonesian fascist military regime also sent a "delegation" from the counter-revolutionary armed forces of West Java, Serimauangi, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian revolutionary people, to Taipei. They signed a $1 million plastic products "cooperation agreement" with the Chiang gang. According to this agreement, Chiang gang members will soon establish a plastic factory in Bandung, West Java.

The Indonesian fascist military regime is also stepping up its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek gang to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese.

The Indonesian fascist military regime's collusion with the political corpse Chiang Kai-shek gang, which has long been spat upon by the Chinese people, is a serious provocation to the great seven hundred million Chinese people. History has proven that anti-China actions will not end well. Like all reactionaries around the world who follow U.S. imperialism in conspiring to create "two Chinas," the Indonesian fascist military regime will also lift a stone to drop on its own feet.

    印尼法西斯小丑为美帝制造“两个中国”阴谋大卖力气
    明目张胆同蒋匪帮加紧勾结
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：在美帝国主义指使下，印尼法西斯军人政权正在日益加紧同中国人民公敌蒋介石匪帮的勾结，露骨地为美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。
    据蒋匪帮报纸七月底透露，印尼法西斯军人政权已经决定派遣一个五人“贸易代表团”常驻台北。蒋介石匪帮驻雅加达的“贸易代表处”成员也已确定，并得到印尼法西斯军人政权的“同意”。据雅加达反动报纸透露，蒋匪帮的“贸易代表处不日即可在雅加达正式设立”，“一切困难已由双方加以解决”。
    所谓互设“贸易”代表机构，实质上是印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋匪帮建立“外交关系”的一个重大步骤，是它追随美帝，阴谋制造“两个中国”的又一罪恶勾当。一年多来，这两条美帝国主义的走狗不断发出要“尽快建交”的叫嚷。今年三月，印尼法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托自封“总统”以后，立即派遣一个代表团，打着“贸易”的幌子，到台湾进行反革命交易的罪恶勾当。这个代表团的团长苏哈迪曼公开叫嚷要同蒋匪帮“加强合作”，“以迈向建交大道”。就在这个“贸易”代表团去台湾的头一天，蒋匪帮报纸就直言不讳地供认，印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋介石匪帮的“外交关系”将在今年内建立。不久以前，蒋匪帮报纸和印尼的反动报纸透露，蒋匪帮决定派往常驻印尼的“贸易代表处”的成员，是由蒋匪帮的“外交官员”和蒋匪帮“侨务委员会专门委员”组成。印尼反动派派驻台湾的“贸易代表处”将“执行领事馆职务”。显而易见，这是印尼法西斯军人政权为了遮人耳目，打着设立“贸易代表处”的幌子，来掩盖它同蒋匪帮建立“外交关系”的罪恶勾当。
    为了博得美帝国主义的欢心，最近印尼法西斯军人政权还“热情接待”了一个又一个挂着不同招牌的蒋匪帮“代表团”。据报道，由十一个蒋匪帮分子组成的所谓“医药代表团”七月间到印尼活动了十天。印尼法西斯军人政权的国防与安全部、交通部、卫生部的头目们以及海军陆战队司令等，都先后同这个蒋匪帮“医药代表团”进行了“亲切的会谈”。据雅加达反动报纸透露，会谈涉及的范围极为广泛，其中包括“建立邦交”，开辟“台北—雅加达之间的航线”，印尼海军同蒋匪帮“在制药方面的合作”以及双方勾结迫害爱国华侨等问题。国防与安全部属下的排华机构头目、反共将领苏纳索七月二十六日在“招待”蒋匪帮“医药代表团”时露骨地叫嚷：“但愿台湾和印尼的关系今后更加紧密”，双方建立“外交关系”的时代“能够重来”。据雅加达电台广播，印尼法西斯军人政权的卫生部长西瓦贝西“欣然接受了”蒋匪帮“医药代表团”要他去“访问台湾”的“正式邀请”。
    印尼法西斯军人政权在“邀请”蒋匪帮“医药代表团”到印尼进行罪恶活动的同时，还派遣双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的反革命武装西爪哇西利万吉师的一个“代表团”到台北，同蒋匪帮签订了价值一千万美元的塑胶制品“合作协定”。根据这个协定，不久蒋匪帮分子将在西爪哇万隆市建立塑胶工厂。
    印尼法西斯军人政权勾结蒋介石匪帮迫害爱国华侨的步伐也在步步加紧。
    印尼法西斯军人政权同早已被中国人民唾弃的政治僵尸蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结，是对伟大的七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。历史早已证明，反华绝没有好下场。同世界上一切追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”阴谋的反动派一样，印尼法西斯军人政权也必将搬起石头砸自己的脚。
