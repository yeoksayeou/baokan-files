The Jin Hua County Revolutionary Committee was recently established. Red Guards cadre, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Ni Fazong, approved a report regarding subsidy fees. Because it did not comply with policy regulations, the report was returned by the relevant department.

Why didn't Comrade Ni consult with the revolutionary leading cadre and Director of the Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Liu Zhengjie, before approving this report? This incident prompted deep reflection from Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee and military representative, Comrade Yu Riyong. He recalled past work and felt that he had not done enough to leverage the role of revolutionary leading cadres and help Revolutionary Committee members correctly recognize and handle revolutionary leading cadres. Regarding this issue, Comrade Yu Riyong studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "correctly handling cadres, which is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great alliances, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This must be resolved." This allowed Comrade Ni to realize that respecting and supporting revolutionary leading cadres is standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and maintaining the proletarian authority of the newly established Revolutionary Committee. To further help Comrade Ni correctly recognize and handle cadres in actual struggles, Comrade Yu Riyong often used the "three-in-one combination" method, allowing new and old cadres to learn from each other, compensate for each other's shortcomings, and deepen proletarian feelings among the Revolutionary Committee's leadership.

Once, Comrade Yu Riyong, along with Old Liu and Comrade Ni, went to Tangxi District to hold a meeting to understand the situation regarding the struggle against enemies and the cleansing of class ranks. During the meeting, grassroots cadres and revolutionary masses raised many policy-related questions about cleansing class ranks. Revolutionary Committee Director Comrade Liu Zhengjie, following Chairman Mao's teachings on conducting struggles against enemies and correctly handling two types of contradictions, as well as the experiences from past political movements in conducting struggles against enemies, answered the questions one by one. Later, this district, in its struggle against enemies and the cleansing of class ranks, followed the policies and strategies set by Chairman Mao, strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions, united the broad revolutionary masses, and severely struck down a handful of class enemies. Through this incident, Comrade Ni deeply understood that revolutionary leading cadres indeed have rich experiences in class struggle and are a precious asset of the Party and the people.

    新老干部要互相学习取长补短
    金华县革委会刚成立不久，红卫兵小将、革委会副主任倪法宗同志，批了一份有关补助费的报告。因不符合政策规定，报告被有关部门退了回来。
    为什么小倪在批这份报告之前，不同革命领导干部、革委会主任刘正杰同志商量呢？这件事引起了县革委会副主任、军队代表于日东同志的深思。他回忆以往的工作，越想越感到自己平时对发挥革命领导干部的骨干作用，帮助革委会成员正确地认识和对待革命领导干部的工作做得不够。针对这个问题，于日东同志就和小倪一起学习了毛主席关于“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的教导，使小倪认识到：尊重和支持革命领导干部，就是站在毛主席的革命路线一边，就是维护新生的革命委员会的无产阶级权威。为了进一步让小倪在实际斗争中正确地认识和对待干部，于日东同志还经常通过“三结合”的办法，让新老干部相互学习，取长补短，加深革委会领导成员之间的无产阶级感情。
    一次，于日东同志和老刘、小倪去汤溪区召开座谈会，了解开展对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍工作的情况。座谈会上，基层干部和革命群众提出了许多有关清理阶级队伍中的政策问题。革委会主任刘正杰同志按照毛主席关于开展对敌斗争和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的教导，以及历次政治运动开展对敌斗争的经验，对下面遇到的问题一一作了解答。后来，这个区在对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍的工作中，遵循毛主席制定的政策和策略，严格区分了两类不同性质的矛盾，团结了广大革命群众，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。通过这件事，深深地教育了小倪，使他具体认识到，革命的领导干部确实有着丰富的阶级斗争经验，是党和人民的宝贵财富。
