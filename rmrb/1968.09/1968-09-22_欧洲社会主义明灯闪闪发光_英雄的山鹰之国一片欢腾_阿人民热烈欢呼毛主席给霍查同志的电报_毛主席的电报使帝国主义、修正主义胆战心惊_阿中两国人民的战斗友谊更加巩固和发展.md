The people of Albania enthusiastically welcome the telegram from the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, sent on the 17th to the great leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary Enver Hoxha of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Chairman Mehmet Shehu of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania. They highly praise the great significance of this telegram and feel greatly inspired and encouraged by it.

On the afternoon of the 18th, Radio Tirana broadcast the full text of the telegram every two hours in its news program. People listened intently to the broadcast and quickly spread the news. Some people even recorded the text and took it to the loudspeakers in factories, mines, agricultural production cooperatives, and other units for broadcast.

On the 19th, the central newspapers of Albania published the full text of the telegram in a prominent position on the first page. The newspapers also used large, bold headlines to quote a passage from the telegram: "The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and strengthened in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will always stand firmly by the side of the brotherly Albanian people at any time and under any circumstances. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only meet with thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure."

On the 20th, the central newspapers of Albania published large, bold headlines on the first page regarding the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, and published editorials and related materials. The "Voice of the People" newspaper also devoted a large amount of space to reporting the enthusiastic response of the Albanian people to this telegram.

In recent days, factories, mines, agricultural production cooperatives, people's army units, government agencies, and schools across Albania have held meetings to collectively read and discuss this telegram. They have also sent letters and telegrams to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Chinese Embassy in Albania, enthusiastically welcoming the great historical significance of this telegram.

The staff of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania said in a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Albania on the 19th: The telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou Enlai makes us particularly happy and proud. The People's Republic of China, the Chinese government, the great seven hundred million Chinese people, the great leader, outstanding Marxist-Leninist, and closest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao, has once again given the highest evaluation to our Marxist-Leninist party, our government, and our heroic people. The comprehensive support of the Chinese comrades for all the revolutionary measures taken by our party in recent years to make Albania a permanent socialist stronghold in Europe is a great encouragement to us. It fills us with confidence and makes us braver in continuing our struggle for socialism and communism, for defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian revolution, and for opposing the two international gendarmes, U.S. imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.

The letter said: We once again express our unbounded joy over the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the victory of the invincible thought of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

The staff of the Prosecutor General's Office of Albania said in their letter: The support given by the fraternal Chinese people and the Communist Party of China to the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party in their struggle against the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leadership and its lackeys, and against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, is a great encouragement to our struggle to defend the fruits of socialist victory. We, together with the people of the whole country, are united as one person around the Labor Party and its Marxist-Leninist leadership. We unanimously condemn the Warsaw Pact, which has long lost the purpose for which it was established and is now indistinguishable from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The staff of the Albanian Women's Union said in their letter: We, the staff of the Albanian Women's Union, like all the Albanian people, are thrilled by the victories of the fraternal seven hundred million Chinese people, because these victories are also our victories, the victories of Marxism-Leninism, and the victories of the revolutionary people of the world. We are more aware than ever that, in addition to our own determination and strength, we also have the generous support of the seven hundred million Chinese people and the support of the revolutionary people of the world.

The workers of the capital, Tirana, regard the publication of the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou as a great piece of news. The Tirana Tractor Parts Factory held a full-factory meeting on the 19th. At the meeting, the secretary of the Labor Party branch read the full text of the telegram to all the workers and unanimously adopted a letter to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Chinese Embassy in Albania. The letter said: The ironclad unity between the two parties and the support of the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and strengthened in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, make us extremely excited. Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "If the U.S. imperialists, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only meet with thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." These warm words are a great encouragement to us. Our country, under the leadership of our glorious Marxist-Leninist party headed by our people's leader and teacher, Comrade Hoxha, is advancing on the correct path. Like the people of the whole country, we, the workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory, will, under the leadership of our glorious commander, Comrade Hoxha, give a fatal blow to any enemy who dares to invade our borders.

Joseph Pashko, a worker representative at the construction materials factory, said at the factory meeting that in this telegram, we once again saw the great fighting friendship between our two peoples. Under the leadership of the two Marxist-Leninist parties headed by Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong, our two peoples are fighting in the same trench. The victories won one after another by the great seven hundred million Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, are another heavy blow to the imperialists and revisionists who try to obstruct the victory of the Chinese revolution. It is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of all countries who are fighting for freedom and independence, and to the struggle of all true revolutionaries in the world to oppose the betrayal of the revisionists, to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

A worker at the ship repair factory of the China-Albania Friendship Port of Durres, Arami, said that Comrade Mao Zedong's telegram is a great encouragement to the revolutionary work, socialist construction, and national defense struggle of our people throughout the country.

The news spread quickly to the vast mountain areas and agricultural production cooperatives. A member of the Dobrachi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the district of Shkoder, Bekovi, said, "Our friendship with the great Chinese people has been tempered in the common struggle against our common enemies. It is as strong as our two peoples."

The people of Gjirokastra, Comrade Hoxha's hometown, enthusiastically welcomed this great news. An old warrior from the National Liberation War said, "The telegram from the great leader of the Chinese people, our close friend Comrade Mao Zedong, will elevate the fighting friendship between our two peoples to a new level. Comrade Mao Zedong's words are a timely and severe warning to imperialism and revisionism."

The revolutionary intellectuals of Albania also enthusiastically welcomed the telegram from Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu. In a letter to the Chinese Embassy, the entire faculty and staff of the University of Tirana pointed out: The Albanian people regard this telegram as a sign that the fraternal friendship between our two parties and peoples has reached a new stage. Engineer Rila of the Patos Automobile Repair Company said, "This telegram from the Chinese party and government leaders is another great historical document of great significance, which makes the imperialists and revisionists tremble with fear."

    毛主席的电报使帝国主义、修正主义胆战心惊  阿中两国人民的战斗友谊更加巩固和发展
    新华社地拉那二十日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大人民热烈欢呼中国人民的伟大领袖、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友、中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志以及中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，十七日打给阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志的电报。他们高度评价这一电报的伟大意义，并为此感到无比的振奋和鼓舞。
    十八日下午，地拉那广播电台在每两小时一次的新闻节目中，一次又一次地全文广播了这个电报。人们都聚精会神地收听广播，并迅速传告。有的人还把电文记录下来，拿到工矿企业、农业生产合作社等单位的有线广播站去转播。
    十九日，阿尔巴尼亚中央各报都在第一版的显著地位全文刊登了这一电报。各报还在通栏大字标题中引用了电报中的一段话：“在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”
    二十日，阿尔巴尼亚中央各报都在第一版以通栏大字标题，就毛主席、林副主席和周总理的电报，分别发表了社论和有关材料。《人民之声报》还用大量篇幅刊登了阿尔巴尼亚全国人民欢呼这一电报的报道。
    连日来，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地工矿企业、农业生产合作社、人民军部队、机关和学校纷纷举行集会，集体阅读和讨论这一电报，并纷纷写信和打电报给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆，热烈欢呼这一电报的重大历史意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议机关工作人员十九日在集会上通过的给中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆的信件中说：毛主席、林副主席和周恩来总理的电报，使我们感到特别的高兴和骄傲。中华人民共和国，中国政府，伟大的七亿中国人民，伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友毛主席，对我们马克思列宁主义的党、我国政府和我国英雄的人民所作的又一次极高的评价，以及中国同志对我们党近年来为使阿尔巴尼亚永远成为欧洲坚强的社会主义明灯所采取的一切革命化措施的全面支持，是对我们十分巨大的鼓励，使我们满怀信心，更加勇敢地继续进行为争取社会主义和共产主义，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和无产阶级革命，以及为反对美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义两个国际宪兵的神圣斗争。
    信件说：我们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，对杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的战无不胜的思想的胜利，再次表示无限的高兴。
    阿尔巴尼亚总检察院全体工作人员在信件中说：兄弟的中国人民和中国共产党，过去和现在对阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党反对苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团及其仆从，反对美帝及其走狗的斗争所给予的支持，是对我们为保卫社会主义胜利果实而进行的斗争的巨大鼓舞。我们同全国人民一起，象一个人一样团结在劳动党及其马克思列宁主义领导的周围。我们一致谴责华沙条约，这个条约早已失去了它为之建立的目的，它已同北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织等毫无区别。
    阿尔巴尼亚妇联全体工作人员在信中说：我们，阿尔巴尼亚妇联工作人员，象全体阿尔巴尼亚人民一样，为兄弟的七亿中国人民的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞，因为这些胜利也就是我们的胜利，也就是马克思列宁主义的胜利，也就是世界各国革命人民的胜利。我们更加清楚地知道，除了我们的决心和力量之外，我们还有七亿中国人民慷慨的援助，还有世界各国革命人民的援助。
    首都地拉那工人阶级把毛主席、林副主席和周总理的电报的发表，看作是特大的喜讯。地拉那拖拉机配件厂十九日举行了全厂大会。会上，劳动党支部书记向全体职工宣读了电报全文，并一致通过了给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆的信。信中说：阿中两党之间的钢铁般的团结和在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民的支持，使我们无比兴奋。毛泽东同志、林彪同志和周恩来同志说：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”这些热情的话是对我们极大的鼓舞。我们的祖国在以我国人民的领袖和导师霍查同志为首的我们光荣的马克思列宁主义党的领导下，正在正确的道路上前进。同全国人民一样，我们拖拉机配件厂的全体职工，将在我们光荣的统帅霍查同志的领导下，给予一切胆敢侵犯我国边境的敌人以致命的回击。
    约瑟夫·帕希科建筑材料厂工人代表在这个厂的集会上说，在这一电报中，我们再一次看到了存在于我们两国人民之间的伟大的战斗友谊。我们两国人民在以霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的两个马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，战斗在同一个战壕里。伟大的七亿中国人民在伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导下的无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一个接着一个的胜利，是对企图阻止中国革命胜利前进的帝国主义者和修正主义者的又一沉重打击，是对正在为自由和独立而斗争的各国革命人民以及全世界真正的革命者反对修正主义者的叛变、捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    中阿友谊之港都拉斯港务局船舶修理厂工人阿拉米说，毛泽东同志的电报是对我们全国人民的革命工作、社会主义建设和保卫祖国的斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    喜讯传到广大山区农业生产合作社以后，社员们立即广为传播。斯库台区道布拉奇农业生产合作社社员别考维说，我们同伟大中国人民的友谊是在反对共同敌人的共同斗争中锤炼起来的。它就象我们两国人民一样坚强。
    霍查同志的故乡纪诺卡斯特人民热烈欢呼这一大喜讯。民族解放战争时期的老战士说，中国人民的伟大领袖、我国人民的亲密朋友毛泽东同志的电报将把我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊提升到更高的阶段。毛泽东同志的话是对帝国主义和修正主义的及时的严厉的警告。
    阿尔巴尼亚革命的知识分子也热烈欢呼毛泽东同志、林彪同志和周恩来同志给霍查同志和谢胡同志的电报。地拉那大学全体教职员在给中国大使馆的信中指出：阿尔巴尼亚人民把这个电报看作是我们两党和两国人民兄弟般永恒友谊发展到新阶段的标志。帕托斯汽车维修公司工程师里拉说，中国党政领导人的这份电报，是又一个具有重大历史意义的伟大文献，它使帝国主义者和修正主义者胆战心惊。
