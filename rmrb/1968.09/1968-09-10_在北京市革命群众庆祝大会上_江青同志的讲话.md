Today, I only found out this morning that there would be such a grand celebration rally for the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, and I was informed at the last minute to say a few words. (Applause)

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, comrades-in-arms of the People's Liberation Army, and young Red Guards, (Applause) I salute you with the salute of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (Applause, the crowd shouts: Learn from Comrade Jiang Qing! Pay tribute to Comrade Jiang Qing! Comrade Jiang Qing also shouts: Learn from you comrades! Pay tribute to you comrades!)

I can't think of any good words to describe the joy in my heart. (Applause)

Recalling the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have gone through so many storms and waves, following our great leader Chairman Mao and bravely advancing, finally smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line headed by China's Khrushchev within the Party. (Applause, the crowd shouts: Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!)

We must not forget that the revolutionary youth and young Red Guards have made great achievements in the early and middle stages of the revolution. (Applause, the crowd shouts: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!)

Now, there are a few individual young Red Guards who have made some mistakes, and we have the responsibility to help them correct them. (Applause, the crowd shouts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!) Even in some units where there have been armed conflicts, it is quite ridiculous. Of course, it is a bad thing, as it alienates the broad masses and the masses within the unit, which is not good. We oppose it. But bad things can be turned into good things, gaining experience and lessons, tempering the revolutionary young guards, (Applause) and exposing the enemy. (Applause)

Under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, on July 27, the main force of the working class stepped onto the stage of the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure. (Applause, the crowd shouts: The working class must lead everything!) The People's Liberation Army is the backbone. (Applause) The young Red Guards and all revolutionary teachers and staff should welcome (Applause) and follow the leadership. (Applause) We do not allow a few bad elements to make trouble, and we must expose those who disrupt the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure. (Applause)

However, the working class, the leading class, must protect the young Red Guards well. (Applause) We must help and educate them. Therefore, I suggest that you also study the editorial note published in the September 5 issue of the *People's Daily* from the *Red Flag* magazine. This editorial note represents the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao. (Applause, the crowd shouts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!)

Our work is still extensive: struggle, criticism, and transformation, rectification of the Party, building the Party, and cleansing the class ranks. We will encounter many things we have not yet recognized. Therefore, we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, be humble and avoid impatience, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to advance victoriously! (Applause)

My speech is over. (Applause, the crowd shouts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!)

    在北京市革命群众庆祝大会上
    江青同志的讲话
    （一九六八年九月七日）
    今天，我是早晨才知道要开这样一个盛大的庆祝全国省、市、自治区成立革命委员会的大会，临时告诉我，要我来说几句话。（鼓掌）
    无产阶级革命派同志们，人民解放军指战员们，红卫兵小将们，（鼓掌）我向你们致无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！（鼓掌，群众高呼：向江青同志学习！向江青同志致敬！江青同志也高呼：向同志们学习！向同志们致敬！）
    我想不出什么好的语言来形容我心中的喜悦。（鼓掌）
    回忆这两年多来无产阶级文化大革命，我们经过多少惊涛骇浪，追随我们伟大的领袖毛主席奋勇前进，终于把党内以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命修正主义路线彻底粉碎了。（鼓掌，群众高呼：无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！）
    我们不要忘记了革命的青年、红卫兵小将在革命的初期，在革命的中期，都建立了丰功伟绩。（鼓掌，群众高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万万岁！）
    在现在有少数个别小将犯了这种或者那种错误，我们有责任帮助他们改正。（鼓掌，群众高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！）就是有个别单位，有什么武斗，那也很滑稽的。当然是坏事情，脱离了广大的群众，也脱离自己本单位的群众，这不是好事，我们反对。但是坏事也可以变成好事，就是取得了经验教训，锻炼了革命小将，（鼓掌）暴露了敌人。（鼓掌）
    在伟大领袖毛主席的号令下，七月二十七号，工人阶级主力军登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台。（鼓掌，群众高呼：工人阶级必须领导一切！）人民解放军做后盾。（鼓掌）红卫兵小将和一切愿意革命的教职员工应该欢迎，（鼓掌）服从领导。（鼓掌）不允许少数个别坏人刁难，要把这些坏人破坏斗、批、改的家伙揪出来。（鼓掌）
    但是，工人阶级，领导的阶级，要好好地保护红卫兵小将。（鼓掌）要帮助他们，教育他们。因此，我建议你们也要好好地学习本月五日《人民日报》发表的《红旗》杂志编者按这一篇按语。这篇按语是代表了我们伟大领袖毛主席的声音的。（鼓掌，群众高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！）
    我们的工作还是很多的，斗、批、改，整党、建党，清理阶级队伍，很多的。我们还会遇上许多我们还没有认识的东西。因此，我们一定要遵照我们的伟大领袖毛主席的教导，戒骄，戒躁，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，胜利前进！（鼓掌）
    我的话完了。（鼓掌，群众高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！）
