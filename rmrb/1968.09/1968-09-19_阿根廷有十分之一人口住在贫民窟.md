Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, and its suburbs have 600,000 people living in slums, according to recent official statistics released by the South American second-largest country. Nationwide, nearly 2 million people live in slums, accounting for roughly one-tenth of the country's total population and one-sixth of the urban population.

The slums are made up of shacks constructed from cardboard, thin wooden boards, and rags. These dwellings are small, low, and lack running water and sewage systems. Most of these shacks are crowded together on wasteland, alongside railways and small rivers, and in damp, low-lying muddy areas.

The majority of slum residents are workers engaged in the heaviest labor but receiving the lowest wages, as well as the unemployed. They mostly come from Argentina's rural areas and small inland cities, as well as impoverished people from Paraguay, Bolivia, and other countries who have come to Argentina seeking work.

The Onganía pro-American dictatorship attempted to forcibly demolish these slums because the residents there are deeply oppressed and frequently rebel. The reactionary authorities sought to disperse these laboring people crowded in the slums, artificially reducing the urban population waiting for jobs.

However, the plan to forcibly demolish the slums has been met with opposition and condemnation from the broad masses of impoverished residents in Argentina. Even residents of slums in some inland cities have launched struggles against the government's plan.

    阿根廷有十分之一人口住在贫民窟
    新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：据阿根廷官方最近发表的缩小了的统计，南美第二大国阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯和郊区有六十万人居住在贫民窟里，全国贫民窟居民近二百万，差不多占全国总人口的十分之一，占全国城市人口的六分之一。
    贫民窟的住房是用纸板、薄木板、破布搭起来的，又小又矮，没有自来水和下水道，这些房子大都拥塞在荒地、铁路和小河的两旁以及潮湿低洼的烂泥地上。
    贫民窟绝大部分居民是从事最沉重的劳动、而工资最少的工人以及失业者。他们大都来自阿根廷农村和内地小城市，以及一些跑到阿根廷来找工作的巴拉圭、玻利维亚等国的穷苦人。
    翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权企图强行拆除这些贫民窟，因为这里的居民受压迫深，他们不断进行反抗。反动当局企图疏散这些拥挤在贫民窟的劳苦人民，用人为办法减少城市的等待就业的人口。
    但是强制拆除贫民窟的计划遭到阿根廷广大贫苦居民的反对和谴责。连内地一些城市的贫民窟居民也展开了反对政府计划的斗争。
