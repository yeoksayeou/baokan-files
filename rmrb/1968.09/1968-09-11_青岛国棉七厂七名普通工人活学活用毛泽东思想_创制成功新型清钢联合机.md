In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seven ordinary workers of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 7 have actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought. They have broken through the bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities" and the "crawling philosophy" of China's Khrushchev, with a revolutionary spirit and a determination to win. Together with an old electrician, they successfully created a new type of cleaning and carding combined machine in less than half a year. This great achievement once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the most intelligent and most capable are those with the most practical experience."

The cleaning and carding combined machine is a machine used in the textile industry to combine the cleaning and carding processes for continuous production. It is a significant technological innovation in the world's textile industry in recent years. This new technology simplifies the process from cleaning the cotton to forming slivers, eliminating the intermediate step of forming cotton rolls, thereby increasing labor productivity. The new type of cleaning and carding combined machine created by Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 7 has a simple structure, is convenient to operate and maintain, and has been proven to meet production requirements after more than three months of use. Its cost is only one-tenth of that of foreign-produced machines.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 7 had proposed to develop a cleaning and carding combined machine. However, this initiative was suppressed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary technological "authorities."

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and established a revolutionary committee. They severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist industrial and technological lines promoted by China's Khrushchev. At this time, the revolutionary masses proposed to develop a cleaning and carding combined machine, which immediately received strong support from the revolutionary committee and the military representatives stationed at the factory. With the care and help of the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses, a group of seven workers was quickly formed to start the trial production of the cleaning and carding combined machine. In the face of difficulties with no resources and no good samples to refer to, they first studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." They drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's teachings.

In the technological revolution, the question of whether to follow foreign examples or to break the mold and forge our own path is a struggle between two lines. The cleaning and carding combined machine group, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "we cannot follow the old path of technological development of various countries in the world, crawling behind others step by step. We must break the rules and adopt advanced technology as much as possible," severely criticized China's Khrushchev's worship of foreign things and "crawling philosophy." They analyzed that the characteristics of foreign cleaning and carding combined machines are "big, foreign, and comprehensive," with poor practicality, strong on the outside but weak on the inside, looking good but not practical. At the same time, they decided that our own production of cleaning and carding combined machines should follow the correct path of saving materials, spending less money, taking less time, and achieving good results.

Taking the path of innovation and carrying out a technological revolution is not an easy task. The workers of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 7 encountered many difficulties in the trial production of the cleaning and carding combined machine. However, they were not intimidated by these difficulties. Instead, they used "Three Articles" as a weapon, fought against selfishness, and followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely and thoroughly serving the people." They were not afraid of difficulties and persisted in experiments. When they failed, they summarized their experiences and lessons, boosted their spirits, and returned to the battlefield. This machine encountered many major problems during the trial, such as uneven slivers and increased cotton defects. At this time, some people sneered behind their backs. Some said, "Just give it up. If it doesn't work, you'll get a bad reputation." At this time, the workers of the cleaning and carding combined machine group specially took out half a day to study "Three Articles." Chairman Mao's teaching of "our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, should raise our courage" nourished the hearts of every member of the cleaning and carding combined machine group. Their spirits were more vibrant, and their fighting spirit was more soaring. They all expressed, "We do not seek fame or personal gain. We are fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Our direction is correct, and our path is right. We will definitely solve the problems." Then they conducted a comprehensive "autopsy," carefully studied, and collectively gathered everyone's wisdom. Finally, they overcame one "roadblock" after another and achieved the final victory.

    青岛国棉七厂七名普通工人活学活用毛泽东思想
    创制成功新型清钢联合机
    据新华社济南十日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，青岛国棉七厂的七名普通工人活学活用毛泽东思想，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的崇洋思想、“爬行哲学”，以敢于革命、敢于胜利的雄心壮志，在老电工的配合下，不到半年时间，就创制成功了一种新型的清钢联合机。这一巨大成就又一次证明毛主席关于“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”这一伟大教导的无比英明和正确。
    清钢联合机是纺织工业生产上把清花与梳棉两道工序联合起来连续生产的一种机器，是近年来世界纺织工业技术革命的一项重要课题。这一新技术，可以把过去由清花机清除棉花杂质后，制成棉卷，再运往梳棉机制成棉条的生产过程简化成为由清花机喂进棉花，到梳棉机就出来棉条，省去了制棉卷的一道工序，提高了劳动生产率。青岛国棉七厂创制成功的这种新型的清钢联合机，结构简单，操作和检修都很便利，投入生产三个多月的结果证明，质量符合生产要求，造价也只及外国生产的十分之一。
    无产阶级文化大革命前，青岛国棉七厂的革命群众就曾提出要搞清钢联合机。但在当时，却被党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”扼杀了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的伟大教导，奋起夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，建立了厂革命委员会，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义工业路线和科技路线。这时革命群众又提出要搞清钢联合机，立即得到厂革委会和驻厂解放军代表的大力支持。在厂革委会和广大革命群众的关怀和帮助下，马上由七个工人组成了清钢联合机小组，着手进行试制工作。他们在一无资料、二无好样板可借鉴的困难情况下，首先学习了毛主席的教导：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”他们从毛主席的教导中汲取了无穷的力量。
    搞清钢联合机，是照着外国的样式仿造，还是打破常规走自己的道路，这是技术革命中两条路线的斗争。清钢联合机小组遵照毛主席“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术”的伟大教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的崇洋思想、“爬行哲学”，分析了外国清钢联合机的特点是“大、洋、全”，实效差，外强中干，好看不好用。同时，决定了我们自己制造清钢联合机应该走用料省，花钱少，时间快，效果好的正确道路。
    走独创的道路，进行技术革命，不是一件轻而易举的事情。青岛国棉七厂的工人在试制清钢联合机的过程中，碰到许多困难，但是他们没有被那些困难所吓倒，而是以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗私心，按照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，不怕困难，坚持试验。失败了，他们就总结经验教训，振奋精神，重上战场。这种机器在试验过程中出现了条干不匀、棉纱疵点增多等许多重大问题。这时，有一些人在背后冷嘲热讽。有的人说：“快算了吧，搞不好落一身臭名。”这时清钢联合机小组的工人就专门拿出半天时间学习“老三篇”。毛主席关于“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，滋润了清钢联合机小组的每一个工人的心，他们的精神更加振奋，斗志更加昂扬，纷纷表示：“我们一不为名，二不为利，为的是和帝、修、反斗争。我们的方向正，路走的对，有问题我们一定能解决。”接着他们就全面“解剖”检查，苦心钻研，群策群力，集中大家的智慧，终于征服了一个又一个“拦路虎”，取得了最后胜利。
