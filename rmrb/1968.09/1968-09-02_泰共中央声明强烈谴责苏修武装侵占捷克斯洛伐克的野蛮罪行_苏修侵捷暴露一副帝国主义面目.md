The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand strongly condemns the brutal crime of the Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia

The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia exposes the true face of imperialism

Only by persisting in revolutionary struggle and thoroughly opposing imperialism and revisionism can people of all countries achieve revolutionary victory

	BEIJING, Aug. 31 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on August 31, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand issued a statement on August 23 strongly condemning the brutal crime of the Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On the night of August 20, the modern revisionist traitor clique in the Soviet Union, together with the modern revisionist cliques of Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary, launched an armed invasion and occupied the entire territory of Czechoslovakia. This is an imperialist act, a barefaced fascist aggression.

	Since the traitor Khrushchev seized power in the Soviet Union, he has restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, ruthlessly oppressed and exploited the Soviet people, turning the socialist Soviet Union into a capitalist country. He has colluded with U.S. imperialism, sabotaged the revolutionary struggles of the world's peoples, and pursued a policy of great-power chauvinism, vying with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world.

	The Soviet revisionist clique's invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia is the result of the implementation of the above policies. In addition to restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, the Khrushchev revisionist clique has done everything possible to restore capitalism in other socialist countries and put them under its control. In Czechoslovakia, the Novotny revisionist traitor clique carried out the restoration of capitalism and pursued a policy of completely submitting to the Soviet revisionists. The Dubcek clique that overthrew Novotny is also a revisionist traitor clique, attempting to break away from the Soviet revisionists to submit to U.S. imperialism. After failing to force Dubcek to submit through all means, the Soviet revisionist clique launched a savage armed invasion and occupied Czechoslovakia. Therefore, all the statements defending the Soviet revisionist clique's invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia cannot cover up the aggressive nature of the Soviet revisionists. Thus, the people of Czechoslovakia, the people of the world, and the people of the Soviet Union resolutely and strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique's aggressive crimes. The Soviet revisionist clique's aggressive crimes, in addition to exposing its imperialist nature, also fully demonstrate the disintegration of modern revisionism and the complete bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionist clique.

	The actions of the Soviet revisionist clique completely declare its betrayal of Marxism-Leninism. The lies of the Soviet revisionist clique about "adhering to Marxism-Leninism," "the Soviet Union is a socialist country," and "supporting the world revolution" have completely collapsed. The people cannot place their hopes on these people. Only by relying on their own strength, resolutely persisting in revolutionary struggle, and thoroughly opposing imperialism and modern revisionism can they achieve revolutionary victory, gain liberation, and be able to maintain their own independence and sovereignty.

	The Communist Party of Thailand and the revolutionary people strongly condemn the actions of the Soviet revisionist clique and its followers this time, and fully support the struggle of the Czechoslovak people to resist foreign invading armies and overthrow the revisionist clique in their own country. We firmly believe that, relying on their own strength and bravely and resolutely persisting in the struggle to the end, the Czechoslovak people will surely achieve victory and will certainly be able to walk the bright path of socialism.

    泰共中央声明强烈谴责苏修武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮罪行
    苏修侵捷暴露一副帝国主义面目
    各国人民只有坚持革命斗争、彻底反对帝国主义和修正主义才能取得革命胜利
    新华社一日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台八月三十一日广播，泰国共产党中央委员会八月二十三日发表声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮罪行。声明全文如下：
    二十日深夜，苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团纠集波兰、东德、保加利亚和匈牙利的现代修正主义集团，出兵武装侵略，并占领了捷克斯洛伐克全部领土。这是帝国主义的行为，是赤裸裸的法西斯侵略行径。
    自从赫鲁晓夫叛徒在苏联篡夺了领导权后，就在苏联复辟资本主义，残酷地压迫剥削苏联人民，把社会主义的苏联变成资本主义的国家，同美帝国主义相互勾结，破坏世界人民的革命斗争，推行大国强权主义政策，同美帝国主义合伙、争夺霸占世界。
    苏修集团这次出兵侵略和占领捷克斯洛伐克，就是推行上述政策的结果。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团除了在苏联复辟资本主义外，还千方百计要使其它社会主义国家复辟资本主义，并处在它的控制下。在捷克斯洛伐克，诺沃提尼修正主义叛徒集团进行资本主义复辟，执行完全投靠苏修的政策。推翻诺沃提尼的杜布切克集团同样是修正主义叛徒集团，它企图摆脱苏修去投靠美帝。苏修集团在使用一切手段强迫杜布切克就范失败后，便野蛮地出兵武装侵略，占领捷克斯洛伐克。因此，为苏修集团这次侵略、占领捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮行径辩护的一切言论，都无法掩盖苏修的侵略本质。所以，捷克斯洛伐克人民、全世界人民以及苏联人民坚决强烈谴责苏修集团的侵略罪行。苏修集团的这次侵略罪行，除了赤裸裸地暴露了它的帝国主义面目之外，还充分表明了现代修正主义的分崩离析和苏修集团的总破产。
    苏修集团的所作所为，彻底宣告它背叛马克思列宁主义。苏修集团所谓“坚持马克思列宁主义”、“苏联是社会主义国家”、“支援世界革命”的谎言彻底破产。人民决不能把希望寄托在这些人身上，只有依靠自己的力量，坚决地坚持革命斗争，彻底反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，才能取得革命的胜利，获得解放以及能够维护自己的独立主权。
    泰国共产党和革命人民强烈谴责苏修集团及其追随者的这次行动，全力支持捷克斯洛伐克人民抗击外国侵略军和推翻本国修正主义集团的斗争。我们坚信，依靠自己的力量，勇敢坚定地坚持斗争到底，捷克斯洛伐克人民必将取得胜利并一定能走上社会主义光明大道。
