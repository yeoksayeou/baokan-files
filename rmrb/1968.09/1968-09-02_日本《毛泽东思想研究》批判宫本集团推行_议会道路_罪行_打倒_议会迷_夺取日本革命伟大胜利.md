Tokyo News: The seventh issue of the Japanese magazine "Mao Zedong Thought Research" published an article titled "The Gongsun Revisionist Group and the Chinese Khrushchev Are Birds of a Feather." The article criticizes the Gongsun revisionist group for promoting the "parliamentary road" and calls on the Japanese people to grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought and advance along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao to achieve victory in the Japanese revolution.

The article states that the great leader of the world's people, Comrade Mao Zedong, teaches: "The central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of political power, which is a problem to be solved by war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad."

The article continues: "Whether the proletariat must seize power through armed struggle or take the 'parliamentary road' is the fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The history of the international communist movement clearly shows that all kinds of revisionists, big and small, are 'parliamentary enthusiasts' who deny that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution."

After listing and criticizing a series of facts about the Chinese Khrushchev's betrayal of the revolution, the article states: "The Chinese Khrushchev also wrote the counter-revolutionary book 'Cultivation,' denying the dictatorship of the proletariat. At the same time, when the entire party was fully engaged in the War of Resistance Against Japan, he demanded that party members abandon the revolutionary war, abandon the issue of armed seizure of power, detach themselves from the war, and focus on 'self-cultivation.' This is to demand that communists become people who neither wage revolutionary war nor seize power, that is, become social democrats in the style of the Second International." The article points out: "Throughout the new democratic stage, the Chinese Khrushchev always emerged at critical turning points in the revolutionary struggle, betraying the people's armed forces to the enemy and attempting to take the 'parliamentary road.'"

After discussing Yasaka Sanzo's dissemination of the fallacy of "peaceful revolution" in 1946, the article states: "At that time, the so-called 'theorist' of the Japanese Communist Party, Gongsun, was not to be outdone. In 1947, he delivered a speech titled 'Prospects for the People's Democratic Revolution,' advocating the 'principle' of 'peaceful revolution theory.' He said: 'The democratization of Japan lies in implementing the principles guaranteed by the Potsdam Declaration. According to this principle, even if the democratic forces with the working class at the core have an overwhelming majority in the parliament, they will not be subjected to violent suppression. From this, one can generally see the possibility of establishing a democratic government through the parliament without armed uprising.' He shamelessly advocated the possibility of peaceful revolution under the occupation of the U.S. military."

The article further states: "The Chinese Khrushchev and Gongsun are both frantically blowing the trumpet of the 'parliamentary road,' opposing the armed seizure of power. This is not a coincidence. Because they are both bourgeois reformists, disciples of Kautsky."

The article states: "These people are selfish individualists who only care about their personal interests and gains, cowards who fear revolution, war, and extreme fear of losing their lives. They have no integrity as revolutionaries, and once something happens, they will immediately surrender to the enemy. Therefore, it is not surprising that Gongsun, in 1950, twice responded to MacArthur's purge order and reported to the U.S. military command, bowing to U.S. imperialism. Just as the Chinese Khrushchev gathered a group of past traitors to plot the seizure of the party central, Gongsun's surroundings are also crawling with traitors like 'surrender' and 'fake surrender.' These people are terrified of violent revolution, frantically shouting for legal struggle, advocating the possibility of the 'parliamentary road,' which is their characteristic. Such shameless traitors' activities fully meet the needs of U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and Soviet modern revisionism to be anti-communist, anti-China, anti-Marxism-Leninism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and to destroy the proletarian revolution worldwide and maintain the rule of U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries. But such traitors will not have a good ending."

After exposing the Gongsun group's false opposition and true betrayal regarding U.S. imperialism, Japanese monopoly capital, rural capitalization, and the rich peasant issue, the article points out: "In the end, the 'parliamentary enthusiast' Gongsun not only wants to abandon violent revolution and betray the revolution in the democratic revolutionary stage but will inevitably, like the Chinese Khrushchev, oppose socialism under the name of 'people's democracy' and stubbornly support bourgeois dictatorship."

The article points out that the Gongsun group, like the Chinese Khrushchev, advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle." "The socialism depicted by the Gongsun revisionist group is a 'happy society' with no classes and class struggle, where there is no need for the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this regard, Gongsun and the Chinese Khrushchev are exactly the same, rotten to the core with the theory of the extinction of class struggle, people with revisionist souls."

The article states: "It is not accidental that the Gongsun group is frantically defending the Chinese Khrushchev. They are birds of a feather."

The article further states: "The Chinese Khrushchev and the Gongsun group, before the proletariat seizes power, are all opposed to violent revolution, kneeling before imperialism and domestic reactionaries, attempting to permanently maintain their reactionary politics. When the proletariat seizes power, they are frantically opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into bourgeois dictatorship. When the socialist system is established, they are scheming in every possible way to plot the restoration of capitalism, the running dogs of the bourgeoisie."

The article states: "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. The history of the international communist movement tells us that the struggle between Marxist-Leninists and various revisionists is entirely about this fundamental issue of revolution, that is, the issue of power. In short, whether or not to acknowledge that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution, whether to insist on or oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, has always been the focal point of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and all revisionism. The current focal point of the struggle is whether to acknowledge or oppose the continuation of the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The article concludes: "The great proletarian cultural revolution has exposed the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese party, the Chinese Khrushchev, under the sun, stripping off his disguise. At the same time, it has also stripped off the disguise of the Gongsun group and their deceptive program. The roar of the great criticism of the 700 million Chinese people is directly a thunderous denunciation of the Gongsun group, which rumbles in the sky above Yoyogi (the location of the Gongsun group), making the Gongsun group tremble. The Gongsun group's slander and insult of Mao Zedong Thought and the great proletarian cultural revolution are merely their dying struggles as they head towards destruction. The Japanese people, who have grasped the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely defeat the traitor Gongsun group, advance along the revolutionary path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and ultimately achieve great victory in the Japanese revolution."

    日本《毛泽东思想研究》批判宫本集团推行“议会道路”罪行
    打倒“议会迷”夺取日本革命伟大胜利
    号召人民努力掌握毛泽东思想，沿着毛主席指出的革命航路前进
    指出宫本集团和中国赫鲁晓夫是一路货色，他们都反对社会主义，拥护资产阶级专政
    新华社一日讯　东京消息：日本《毛泽东思想研究》杂志第七期登载一篇文章，题目是《宫本修正主义集团和中国赫鲁晓夫是一丘之貉》。文章批判了宫本修正主义集团推行“议会道路”的罪行，号召日本人民努力掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，沿着毛主席所指出的革命道路前进，夺取日本革命的胜利。
    文章说，世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    文章接着说：承认无产阶级必须通过武装斗争夺取政权还是要走“议会道路”，这是马克思列宁主义同修正主义的根本分歧。国际共产主义运动的历史清楚地表明，大大小小的各种修正主义者全都一样，是“议会迷”，他们否认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律。
    文章列举中国赫鲁晓夫的一系列叛卖革命的事实并加以批判之后说：“中国赫鲁晓夫还写了《修养》这本反革命的书，否认无产阶级专政。同时，正当全党全力以赴进行抗日战争的时候，他却要求党员抛开革命战争，抛弃武装夺取政权的问题，脱离战争，一心努力‘自我修养’。这就是要求共产党员成为既不进行革命战争，也不夺取政权的庸人，即成为第二国际式的社会民主主义者。”文章指出：“中国赫鲁晓夫在整个新民主主义阶段中，每当革命斗争处于新的转折点的时候，总是跳出来，把人民的武装力量出卖给敌人，企图走‘议会道路’。”
    文章在谈到野坂参三于一九四六年就散布“和平革命论”的谬论后说：当时自称为“日共理论家”的宫本也不甘拜下风，在一九四七年发表了题为《人民民主革命的展望》的演讲，叫嚣要建立“和平革命论”的“原则”。他在讲演中说：“日本民主化在于实行波茨坦宣言所保证的原则，按照这个原则，以工人阶级为核心的民主力量即使在议会中占有压倒的多数，也不会遭到暴力镇压。从这里可以大体看到不靠武装起义而通过议会建立民主政权的可能性。”他就是这样恬不知耻地主张在美军占领下有进行和平革命的可能性的。
    文章还说：“中国赫鲁晓夫和宫本都在拚命地吹着‘议会道路’的喇叭，反对武装夺取政权，这完全不是偶然的一致。因为他们都是资产阶级改良主义者，是考茨基的门徒。”
    文章说：“这些家伙都是只顾个人名利的自私自利的个人主义者，是害怕革命，害怕战争，极端害怕丧失生命的胆小鬼。他们丝毫没有一个革命家的气节，一旦遇到有事的时候，就立刻会向敌人投降。所以宫本在一九五○年曾两次答复麦克阿瑟整肃命令，到美军司令部报到，向美帝国主义低头，也决不足为奇。同中国赫鲁晓夫收罗过去的叛徒集团，阴谋篡夺党中央一样，宫本的周围也象粪上爬满的蛆虫一样，什么‘自首’，‘假自首’等等叛徒成群地在蠕动着。这些家伙在暴力革命面前吓破了胆，拚命叫嚷合法斗争，主张‘议会道路’的可能性，这是他们的特点。这样的无耻叛徒们的活动完全适合美帝国主义和各国反动派以及苏联现代修正主义的反共、反华、反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的需要，适合于破坏全世界的无产阶级革命和维持美帝国主义以及各国反动派的统治的目的。但是，这样的叛徒是决不会有好下场的。”
    文章在揭露宫本集团在对待美帝国主义、日本垄断资本和农村的资本主义化以及富农问题上的假反对、真叛卖后指出：“归根结底，‘议会迷’宫本不仅是要在民主革命阶段放弃暴力革命背叛革命，而且结果必然要同中国赫鲁晓夫一样，要在‘人民民主’的美名下，实际上反对社会主义，顽固地拥护资产阶级专政。”
    文章指出，宫本集团同中国赫鲁晓夫一样，他们都鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论。“宫本修正主义集团所描绘的社会主义是完全没有阶级和阶级斗争的‘幸福社会’，在这里已经完全没有无产阶级专政的必要了。”“在这一点上，宫本和中国赫鲁晓夫也是完全一样的，是腐朽透顶的阶级斗争熄灭论者，是具有修正主义灵魂的人们。”
    文章说：“宫本一伙拚命为中国赫鲁晓夫辩护，决不是偶然的。他们本来就是一丘之貉。”
    文章还说：“中国赫鲁晓夫同宫本一伙在无产阶级夺取政权以前就都是反对暴力革命，跪倒在帝国主义和本国反动派脚下，企图永久维持他们的反动政治的家伙。在无产阶级夺取了政权的时候，他们是拚命地反对无产阶级专政，企图把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政的家伙。在社会主义制度建立起来的时候，他们是千方百计地策划资本主义复辟的资产阶级的走狗。”
    文章说：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。国际共产主义运动的历史告诉我们，马克思列宁主义者和形形色色的修正主义者之间的斗争完全是围绕着这个革命的根本问题，即政权问题进行的。总而言之，承认不承认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，是坚持还是反对无产阶级专政，这从来就是马克思列宁主义同一切修正主义进行斗争的焦点。今天的斗争焦点是，承认还是反对在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命。”
    文章最后说：“伟大的无产阶级文化大革命把中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派中国赫鲁晓夫暴露在光天化日之下，剥掉了他的画皮。同时也就剥掉了宫本一伙和他们的骗人纲领的画皮。中国七亿人民的大批判的吼声直接就是抨击宫本一伙的雷声，它在代代木（宫本集团所在地）的上空轰鸣着，把宫本一伙吓得发抖。宫本一伙对毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑和辱骂只不过是它走向灭亡的垂死挣扎而已。掌握了毛泽东思想伟大真理的日本人民一定会打倒叛徒宫本一伙，沿着毛泽东同志所指出的革命道路前进，最后取得日本革命的伟大胜利。”
