	Ambassadors of Arab countries in China hold a reception
	Vice Premier Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Zale attend and speak, jointly wishing for the continuous development of friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples

	BEIJING, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors of Arab countries in China held a reception today in Beijing to welcome the delegation of the People's Republic of South Yemen led by Foreign Minister Saf al-Ahmad Zale.

	Ambassador of the Yemen Arab Republic to China, Helbash, spoke on behalf of the Arab ambassadors in China at the reception. Zale and Vice Premier Chen Yi also spoke at the reception. They jointly wished for the consolidation and development of the combat friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

	Ambassador Helbash said that the visit of the South Yemen delegation to China once again proves the good relations between the Arab countries and the People's Republic of China. He expressed his belief that the delegation's visit would make a positive contribution to strengthening the friendly relations between the peoples of the Arab countries and the people of China.

	The ambassador emphasized that the armed struggle of the Palestinian people would shatter the dream of the Jewish racists and imperialists to maintain their colonial rule in the Arab region. He thanked the Chinese people for supporting the struggle of the Palestinian Arab people and all Arab people against imperialism and Zionism.

	Foreign Minister Zale said that the delegation was even more pleased to be in China for such a reception because China is "a friendly country, a great revolutionary land."

	He said that the counter-revolutionary forces represented by imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries would not easily accept their defeat in South Yemen, but the South Yemen people would be able to smash any new conspiracies and invasions.

	Zale said that the resistance forces of the Arab people are powerful and they will be able to recover all the lost Arab lands. The armed guerrilla warfare of the Palestinian people has taken the first step and will complete its entire journey. The humiliation of the plunder of Palestine and the occupation of Arab lands will definitely be washed away, "the truth is in our hands, and history will prove that victory is ours."

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that the peoples of the Arab countries, in order to resist the aggression and enslavement of imperialism, to struggle for national liberation and to maintain national independence, have waged a heroic struggle. Last June, U.S. imperialism supported its tool, Israel, to launch an aggression against the Arab people. Modern revisionism betrayed the interests of the Arab people at a critical moment, bringing setbacks to the Arab people. However, the Arab people will not yield; they are continuing their struggle, and their awareness is rapidly increasing. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Arab peoples against the aggression of the U.S. and Israel, and against imperialism and old and new colonialism. We believe that as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will definitely win the final victory against imperialism and its accomplices.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the visit of the South Yemen guests not only helps to enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and South Yemen but will also further strengthen the unity of the Chinese people with the peoples of the Arab countries and the peoples of Asia and Africa in the anti-imperialist cause.

	Relevant officials from the Chinese government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant parties attended the reception upon invitation. They included Wang Xinting, Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Xie Huai De, Xiang Qian, Ding Xilin, and Pan Zhenwu.

	Representatives of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in the capital, responsible members of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, and representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the PLA stationed in Beijing also attended the reception.

	Ambassadors from various countries in China were also invited to attend the reception.

    阿拉伯国家驻华使节举行招待会
    陈毅副总理和扎莱外长出席讲话，共祝中国和阿拉伯人民友谊不断发展
    新华社二十一日讯 阿拉伯国家驻中国使节为欢迎由南也门外交部长塞弗·艾哈迈德·扎莱率领的南也门人民共和国代表团，今天在北京举行招待会。
    阿拉伯也门共和国驻中国大使赫尔巴什代表阿拉伯国家驻中国使节在招待会上讲话，扎莱外长和陈毅副总理也在招待会上讲了话。他们共祝中国和阿拉伯各国人民在反帝斗争中结成的战斗友谊不断巩固和发展。
    赫尔巴什大使说，南也门代表团的访问中国，再次证明阿拉伯各国与中华人民共和国之间的良好关系。他表示相信代表团的这次访问，在巩固阿拉伯各国人民和中国人民之间的友好关系方面将做出积极的贡献。
    大使强调指出，巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，将粉碎犹太种族主义者和帝国主义在阿拉伯地区保持其殖民统治的美梦。他感谢中国人民支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民及全体阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争。
    扎莱外长说，代表团为能在中国参加这样的招待会感到更加愉快，因为中国“是友好的国家，是伟大的革命土地。”
    他说，以殖民主义、帝国主义和反动派为代表的反革命力量，是不会甘心它们在南也门的失败的，但是，南也门人民能够粉碎它们的任何新的阴谋和入侵。
    扎莱外长说，阿拉伯人民的反抗力量是巨大的，他们完全能够收复全部阿拉伯的失地。巴勒斯坦人民的武装游击战迈出了第一步，并且将走完其全部路程。巴勒斯坦被掠夺、阿拉伯土地被占领的耻辱一定会被洗刷，“真理在我们手里，历史将证明胜利是我们的。”
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，阿拉伯各国人民，为了反抗帝国主义的侵略和奴役、争取民族解放和维护民族独立，进行了英勇的斗争。去年六月，美帝国主义支持它的侵略工具以色列，发动了对阿拉伯人民的侵略战争，现代修正主义在关键时刻出卖了阿拉伯人民的利益，给阿拉伯人民带来了挫折。但是，阿拉伯人民是不会屈服的，他们正在继续斗争，他们的觉悟正在迅速提高。中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美、以侵略、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争。我们相信，只要阿拉伯人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够赢得反对帝国主义及其帮凶的最后胜利。
    陈毅副总理说，南也门贵宾们的访问不仅有助于增进中国和南也门两国人民之间的友谊，而且将进一步加强中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民和亚非人民的团结反帝事业。
