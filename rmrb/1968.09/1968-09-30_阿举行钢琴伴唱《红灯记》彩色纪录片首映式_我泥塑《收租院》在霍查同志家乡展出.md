The Ministry of Education and Culture, the Committee for Cultural and Friendly Relations with Foreign Countries, and the "New Albania" Film Studio of Albania jointly held the premiere of the Chinese color documentary film "The Red Detachment of Women" with piano accompaniment at the Cultural Palace in Tirana on September 28 to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Behri, the secretary of the basic Party organization of the "New Albania" Film Studio, said in his speech at the premiere: "The Red Detachment of Women" with piano accompaniment is a new form of musical art, a creation of the proletarian cultural revolution, a flower nurtured by the brilliant thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, and a result of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "learning from the past to serve the present and learning from foreigners to serve China."

Behri said, "The Red Detachment of Women" with piano accompaniment is a combination of revolutionary political content and beautiful artistic form. On the one hand, it retains the main characteristics of Peking opera, and on the other hand, due to the piano's sound, the singing becomes more abundant.

Attending the premiere were: Deputy Minister of Education and Culture of Albania, Bala; Chairman of the Committee for Cultural and Friendly Relations with Foreign Countries, Mi. Treska; Director of the First Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi. Charchani; Director of the "New Albania" Film Studio, Va. Aristidi; and workers, soldiers of the people's army, cadres, and students from Tirana. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingcan, and embassy staff, as well as Chinese engineering and technical personnel in Tirana, were invited to attend the premiere.

The Chinese color documentary film "The Red Detachment of Women" with piano accompaniment began screening at the Tirana Cinema on September 29.

To celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese clay sculpture exhibition "The Opium War" opened on September 26 in Gjirokastra, the hometown of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

In the exhibition hall, there were portraits of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as the national flags of the two countries and quotations from Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong about the great friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

The chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Gjirokastra District, Mecini, and the secretary of the Gjirokastra District Party Committee of the Party of Labor, Bakiri, attended the opening ceremony.

The commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Chen Guang, was invited to attend the opening ceremony.

In her speech at the opening ceremony, Delvish, the vice-chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Gjirokastra District, said that this exhibition is being held in our city at a time when our people have heard the good news that the red flag of the proletarian cultural revolution is flying high all over China. She said that the exhibits in this exhibition clearly prove the profound changes that have taken place in the field of art in China during the proletarian cultural revolution.

Delvish said that the recent telegrams from Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu once again embody the unbreakable friendship and revolutionary unity between the peoples of the two countries. This telegram inspires the Albanian people and encourages them to strive for new victories in socialist construction and in the international class struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Previously, the Chinese clay sculpture exhibition "The Opium War" had been exhibited in Tirana and Fieri, receiving enthusiastic praise from a wide audience.
