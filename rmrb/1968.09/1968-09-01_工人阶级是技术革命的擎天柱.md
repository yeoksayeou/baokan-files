The great leader Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Anshan Constitution" for running socialist enterprises in 1960, pointing out to us the brilliant path of putting politics in command, Party leadership, launching mass movements, carrying out technological revolutions, and relying on the strength of our working class to develop production and science and technology.

However, the clique of revisionists within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, has been relentlessly pushing the revisionist line for many years, fiercely resisting the "Anshan Constitution." They oppose launching mass movements and technological revolutions, oppose self-reliance, and advocate crawling. China's Khrushchev's agents in Anshan and the revisionists in our factory have been following suit, rigidly applying foreign doctrines, practicing "expert management," and suppressing the politics of the worker masses, severely constraining the development of production and technology.

Several years ago, the state urgently needed a type of extremely thin, ultra-low carbon alloy steel pipe. The order was placed with Anshan Steel multiple times, but China's Khrushchev's agents in Anshan deceived the central authorities and suppressed the masses, using various excuses to refuse the order. Later, we workers learned from relevant parties about the great significance of producing this type of steel pipe and immediately expressed our determination to complete this task, to make Chairman Mao proud and to make the Chinese working class proud. China's Khrushchev's agents in Anshan and the revisionists in our factory jumped out again to obstruct and intimidate the workers in every possible way, attempting to prevent us from accepting this task. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses waged a tenacious struggle against the revisionists. During the trial production process, they broke through the revisionists' restrictions and sabotage in terms of equipment, manpower, materials, and time, finding materials themselves, making equipment themselves, overcoming numerous difficulties, and breaking through numerous obstacles, ultimately succeeding in the trial production! In this way, we broke through the blockade of imperialism and modern revisionism and made Chairman Mao proud. The revolutionary masses named this extremely thin, ultra-low carbon alloy steel pipe the "Proud" brand steel pipe.

The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish. We Chinese workers and people build our country not by relying on heaven, earth, or foreigners, but by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have boundless wisdom and strength, and we can create miracles. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, our factory has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticized the revisionist line of running enterprises, and achieved rapid development in production and technology. In just over a year, we successfully developed 1,600 new products, equivalent to the total of the ten years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The variety and specifications have also increased by more than 50%, achieving new merits for the people on the battlefield against imperialism and revisionism.

    工人阶级是技术革命的擎天柱
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂工人工程师  李振明
    伟大领袖毛主席在一九六○年亲自制定了办好社会主义企业的
  “鞍钢宪法”，给我们指出了政治挂帅，党的领导，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，依靠我们工人阶级自己的力量，发展生产和发展科学技术的光辉道路。
    但是，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，多年来却拚命地推行修正主义路线，疯狂地抵制
  “鞍钢宪法”。他们反对大搞群众运动和大搞技术革命，反对自力更生，推行爬行主义。中国赫鲁晓夫在鞍山的代理人和我厂的走资派，也跟在后面，死搬硬套洋教条，搞“专家治厂”，专工人群众的政，严重地束缚了生产和技术的发展。
    几年前，国家就急需一种极薄超低碳合金钢管，多次向鞍钢订货，可是中国赫鲁晓夫在鞍钢的代理人，上欺中央，下压群众，以种种借口不接受订货。后来我们工人从有关方面了解到生产这种钢管的重大意义，立即表示坚决完成这项任务，为毛主席争气，为中国工人阶级争气。中国赫鲁晓夫在鞍山的代理人和我厂的走资派，又跳出来百般刁难、恐吓工人，妄图不让我们接受这一任务。广大革命职工在毛泽东思想指引下，同走资派进行顽强的斗争。在试制过程中，冲破了走资派在设备、人力、物力、时间等方面的限制和破坏，没有材料自己找，没有设备自己造，克服了重重困难，突破了重重障碍，终于试制成功了！就这样，我们打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义的封锁，为毛主席争了气。广大革命职工把这种极薄超低碳合金钢管命名为“争气”牌钢管。
    卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢。我们中国工人阶级和中国人民搞建设，不靠天，不靠地，不靠洋人，靠的是毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，我们就有无穷的智慧和力量，就能创造出人间的奇迹。我们工厂自无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，由于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判了修正主义办企业路线，使生产和技术得到高速度的发展。在一年多的时间里就试制成功一千六百项新产品，相当于无产阶级文化大革命以前十年的总和，品种规格也扩大了百分之五十以上，在反帝反修的战场上为人民立了新功。
