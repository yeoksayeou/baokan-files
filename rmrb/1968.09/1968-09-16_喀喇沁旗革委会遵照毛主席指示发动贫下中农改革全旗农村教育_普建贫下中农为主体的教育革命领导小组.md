The Revolutionary Committee of Kalaqin Banner, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to reform rural education throughout the banner and establish education revolution leadership groups with poor and lower-middle peasants as the mainstay. This has thoroughly smashed the revisionist educational line and ended the situation where bourgeois intellectuals dominated the schools. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully say: "Now that we poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of rural education, the schools are run according to our wishes."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hohhot on the 15th, the great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Kalaqin Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and have become even more determined to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out the proletarian educational revolution in rural schools. The banner's Revolutionary Committee has thoroughly studied and applied Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution, with the help of local PLA troops, mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants, and in the past few months, has gradually taken control of all rural schools in the banner. Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," they have reformed junior high and primary education in rural areas, ending the situation where bourgeois intellectuals dominated the schools. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully say: "Now that we poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of rural education, the schools are run according to our wishes!"

In April and May of this year, the banner's Revolutionary Committee conducted educational revolution pilot projects in several production brigades such as the Dongfanghong People's Commune. Leading comrades of the banner's Revolutionary Committee, combining practice with study, deeply understood from Chairman Mao's teaching that "without poor peasants, there can be no revolution." They realized that the rural educational revolution must rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Without the participation of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, no rural revolution can succeed. Based on the experience gained from the pilot projects, the banner's Revolutionary Committee organized classes throughout the banner with the educational revolution as the central content, mobilizing poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, brigade cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the educational revolution. They combined this with class education on recalling bitterness and sweetness. These classes trained a large number of cadres for the educational revolution, launching a large-scale study and propaganda campaign. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively took action. Most teachers, after studying with the poor and lower-middle peasants, also raised their consciousness, overcame selfish thoughts, and were determined to carry the educational revolution through to the end.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings on investigation and research and the mass line, the banner's Revolutionary Committee led the eighteen communes and four farms in the banner, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, to conduct mass investigations. Based on these investigations, they thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev and carried out a thorough reform of rural school education. At various types of investigation meetings and symposiums, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants bitterly recounted the pain of having no right to education and being illiterate in the old society. They used a large number of facts to expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in pushing the revisionist educational line after liberation, excluding the children of workers and peasants from school, and the poisoning of young people by bourgeois intellectuals who dominated the schools. In the Dongfeng Brigade, out of eight middle school students in the entire brigade, five were children of landlords and rich peasants; in the Sixth Production Brigade of the Workers and Peasants Brigade, out of sixty households, only one had a high school student since liberation, and that student came from a landlord's family. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: Our children, not to mention going to middle school or university, many were held back in elementary school by the "exam barrier" and the "score barrier." They pointed out sharply: "The 'score line' that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about is purely a 'restoration line' for landlords and capitalists!" Poor and lower-middle peasants said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." What the Chinese Khrushchev does is to separate education from productive labor, aiming to serve his plot to restore capitalism. Even if our children go to school, they are corrupted by his revisionist black goods. Some even exposed that under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists had infiltrated the rural teaching staff, and some even controlled the leadership of the schools. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously declared: We must seize the power of rural education and firmly hold it in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and brigade cadres thoroughly smashed the revisionist educational line and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and his series of instructions on the educational revolution, they carried out thorough reforms in rural education. During the struggle, criticism, and transformation, many brigades established education revolution leadership groups with poor and lower-middle peasants as the mainstay, with the participation of brigade cadres and revolutionary teachers and students, and took control of the schools. The Workers and Peasants Brigade, where the banner's Revolutionary Committee conducted pilot projects, with the help of PLA troops, thoroughly reformed the extremely reactionary "two educational systems" of the Chinese Khrushchev, which advocated "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others." They merged the full-time primary schools, part-time primary schools, and agricultural high schools of the entire brigade into one, changing the six-year primary school system and three-year junior high school system into a seven-year continuous system. They followed the "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, taking the proletarian path of school construction. The teaching principles and content were guided by the fundamental idea of cultivating students who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The curriculum emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, and according to the needs of class struggle and production struggle in rural areas, adopted the principle of "few but essential" to reform the textbooks. Teachers and students often labored and conducted revolutionary criticism together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, they fundamentally changed the past situation where education was separated from proletarian politics, production practice, and workers and peasants.

Such rural schools established according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line were immediately warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. After unified planning and promotion by the banner's Revolutionary Committee, in less than three months, 199 such schools managed by poor and lower-middle peasants were established in 168 brigades throughout the banner. Poor and lower-middle peasants cherish such schools very much, just as Chairman Mao said 41 years ago: "They are very enthusiastic about opening such schools, believing that only such schools are truly theirs."

    喀喇沁旗革委会遵照毛主席指示发动贫下中农改革全旗农村教育
    普建贫下中农为主体的教育革命领导小组
    大破修正主义教育路线，结束了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的局面。广大贫下中农欢欣鼓舞地说：“咱贫下中农掌了农村教育大权，学校就办到咱贫下中农心坎上了。”
    据新华社呼和浩特十五日电　伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”内蒙古自治区喀喇沁旗革命委员会的成员学习了毛主席的最新指示，更加坚定了依靠贫下中农把农村学校的无产阶级教育革命搞得好上加好的决心。这个旗的革命委员会，大学大用毛主席的教育革命思想，在人民解放军当地驻军指战员的帮助下，发动贫下中农，在过去的几个月中，已把全旗农村学校陆续管理起来，并遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，对农村初中和小学教育进行了改革，结束了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的局面。广大贫下中农欢欣鼓舞地说：“咱贫下中农掌了农村教育大权，学校就办到咱贫下中农心坎上了！”
    今年四、五月间，旗革命委员会在东方红公社工农兵大队等几个大队进行了教育革命试点。旗革委会的领导同志结合实践，学习毛主席的“没有贫农，便没有革命”的教导，深刻认识到：农村教育革命，必须依靠广大贫下中农。农村中的一切革命，没有广大贫下中农参加，就一定搞不好。他们根据试点取得的经验，在全旗各社、队大办以教育革命为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，组织贫下中农、民兵、队干部和革命师生，学习毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示，结合进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。这种学习班培训了一大批教育革命的骨干分子，开展教育革命的大学习，大宣传。广大贫下中农学习了毛主席的指示，都积极行动起来。大多数教员经过和贫下中农一起学习，也提高了觉悟，克服了私心杂念，决心把教育革命进行到底。
    旗革委会遵照毛主席关于调查研究和群众路线的教导，领导全旗十八个公社和四个农牧场，以贫下中农为主力军，开展群众性的大调查，在调查研究的基础上，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线进行大批判，对农村学校教育进行大改革。在各种类型的调查会、座谈会上，广大贫下中农大诉旧社会无权受教育和没文化的痛苦，用大量事实揭露中国赫鲁晓夫在解放后推行修正主义教育路线，排斥工农子女入学和资产阶级知识分子统治的学校毒害青少年等方面的罪行。东风大队全队只有八名中学生，地富子女就占了五名；工农兵大队第六生产队六十户，解放以来只有一名高中生，却出在地主家里。贫下中农说：我们的孩子不要说上中学、大学，许多人在小学就被“考试关”、“分数关”给卡下来了。他们一针见血地指出：“中国赫鲁晓夫搞的什么‘分数线’，纯粹是地主资本家的‘复辟线’！”贫下中农说，毛主席教导我们：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”中国赫鲁晓夫搞的却是教育同生产劳动脱离，目的是为他妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋服务。贫下中农的孩子即使上了学，也被他们那套修正主义黑货给腐蚀坏了。有的还揭露，在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的庇护下，一小撮叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子混进了农村教师队伍，有的还把持了学校的领导权。广大贫下中农一致表示：一定要把农村教育大权夺过来，牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”广大贫下中农和社队干部大破修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示和关于教育革命的一系列指示，对农村教育大刀阔斧地进行了改革。许多社队在斗、批、改中，纷纷建立了以贫下中农为主体的、有社队干部和革命师生参加的教育革命领导小组，把学校管了起来。旗革委会试点的工农兵大队，在解放军指战员的帮助下，彻底改革了中国赫鲁晓夫那套极其反动的“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的“两种教育制度”，把全大队的全日制小学、耕读小学、农业中学合并起来，把小学六年制和初中三年制改为七年一贯制。以毛主席“五·七”指示为最高纲领，走无产阶级建校的道路。教学方针和教学内容，以培养学生永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为根本指导思想。课程设置突出毛泽东思想，根据农村阶级斗争和生产斗争的需要，采取少而精的原则，对教材加以改革。教师、学生经常和贫下中农一起劳动，一起搞革命大批判。这样，就从根本上改变了过去教育脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产实际，脱离工农的状况。
    这种按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线建立的农村学校一出现，立即受到了广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。经过旗革委会的统一规划和推广，不到三个月，全旗一百六十八个大队，就建立了一百九十九所这样的由贫下中农管理的学校。贫下中农对这样的学校非常爱护，正如毛主席在四十一年前所说的：“他们非常热心开办这种学校，认为这样的学校才是他们自己的。”
