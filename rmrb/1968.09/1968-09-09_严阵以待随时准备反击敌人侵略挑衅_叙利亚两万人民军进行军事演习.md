Approximately 20,000 members of the Syrian People's Army conducted a large-scale military exercise in the suburbs of Damascus early on the 5th. This exercise was prepared in response to the threat of new aggression by the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, and to defend the capital, Damascus.

After the exercise, the People's Army units paraded through the streets of Damascus for four hours. They chanted, "Down with imperialism!" "No compromise for the cause of Palestine!" They also carried banners with slogans such as, "Armed struggle is the only path to our victory," and "Do not heed Yalin's moves, no land will be ceded."

Later, the People's Army held a rally at the Mazraa Stadium. Syrian People's Army Commander Rabah Tawil addressed the rally, saying, "The Arab masses have chosen armed struggle as the basic principle to oppose imperialism and Zionism."

Tawil said, "People's war is a revolutionary war, and all organized Arab masses should participate." He added, "Syria has established a People's Army to defend its territory, and they will fight alongside the Syrian regular army in war."

Tawil pointed out, "The Arab people are much stronger than imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries." Leading the People's Army parade were Syrian Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin and Tawil.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Israeli aggressor forces, backed by U.S. imperialism, carried out military provocations against Syria on the nights of the 2nd and 3rd, both of which were met with Syrian military counterattacks.

According to Damascus Radio, a Syrian military spokesman announced that on the night of the 3rd, an Israeli aggressor force's troop carrier opened fire on Syrian military positions in Um al-Qays on the Golan Heights. The Syrian military responded with a counterattack, destroying the enemy's troop carrier.

Earlier, on the night of the 2nd, Israeli aggressor forces had fired automatic weapons from armored vehicles at Syrian military positions in Um al-Qays, which were also met with Syrian military counterattacks.

    演习后，人民军部队在大马士革街上举行了历时四小时的游行。他们高呼：“打倒帝国主义！”“为了巴勒斯坦事业不能妥协！”他们还拿着旗帜，上面写着：“武装斗争是我们取得胜利的唯一道路”，“不要理会雅林的乱动，决不割让领土”。
    然后，人民军在麦兹拉运动场举行大会。叙利亚人民军司令拉巴赫·塔维勒在大会上讲话说：“阿拉伯群众选择武装斗争作为反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的基本原则。”
    塔维勒说：“人民战争是革命战争，一切有组织的阿拉伯群众应当参加。”他又说：“叙利亚已经建立了保卫自己领土的人民军，他们将在战争中同叙利亚正规军并肩作战。”
    塔维勒指出：“阿拉伯人民比帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派强大得多。”率领人民军游行的有叙利亚总理优素福·扎因和塔维勒。
