People's liberation forces in South Vietnam's Ninh Thuan, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, and other provinces have recently continued to take the initiative in attacking the enemy, annihilating a large number of US and puppet forces.

On the morning of September 19, the people's liberation forces in Ninh Thuan Province launched a sudden attack on the enemy about six kilometers south of Binh Khe, severely defeating a battalion of puppet troops. That night, they annihilated a puppet security company in the southwest of Ninh Thuan City and simultaneously attacked a US military base in the Binh Khe area. After more than an hour of fighting, they annihilated more than 100 US troops and destroyed many military vehicles, cannons, and military supplies.

In the early hours of September 21, the people's liberation forces fiercely bombarded a puppet marine camp in the southwest of Ninh Thuan City and then charged into the enemy camp from several directions, annihilating the puppet battalion in one go.

Prior to this, the people's liberation forces in Ninh Thuan Province had launched an attack on a US military base in Don Thuong Commune, Thuan Binh District, at dawn on September 16, killing and wounding 450 US invaders and destroying 16 cannons and mortars as well as 12 military vehicles.

In early September, guerrilla forces and local units in Phu Yen and Ninh Thuan Provinces launched multiple attacks, annihilating nearly 550 US and puppet troops, destroying 21 enemy cannons and 5 military vehicles, and seizing a large number of weapons and military supplies.

From August 1 to September 11, the people's liberation forces in Binh Dinh Province launched multiple attacks on enemy bases and camps, annihilating and dissolving more than 2,500 enemy troops, including nearly 1,000 US invaders and South Korean mercenaries. Additionally, they shot down or destroyed more than 30 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 80 enemy military vehicles, destroyed 13 enemy cannons, and burned approximately one million liters of gasoline.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, Lao patriotic forces reclaimed the Ba Kao and Muang Tai areas in early September. Local forces and guerrillas in Xieng Khouang Province, in close coordination with the province's patriotic neutral forces, launched a fierce attack on bandits in the Ba Kao area at the beginning of September, annihilating 25 enemies, seizing a large number of weapons and supplies, and completely reclaiming the Ba Kao area. Currently, the patriotic forces are pursuing and annihilating the remaining enemies.

From the night of September 7 to the early morning of September 8, patriotic forces in Xieng Khouang Province attacked bandits in the Muang Tai area in the south of the province. After a short but intense battle, the patriotic forces killed and wounded many enemies and reclaimed the area.

At the same time, patriotic forces in Xieng Khouang Province also fiercely bombarded enemy strongholds in the Ben Long and Phou Theng areas north of Xieng Khouang City, causing significant damage to enemy facilities and barracks.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, patriotic forces in Sam Neua Province, Laos, continued their victories during the rainy season, taking the initiative to attack the enemy and achieving new victories.

The broadcast said that, according to incomplete statistics, the People's Liberation Army of Sam Neua Province annihilated 156 bandits trained by US aggressors in August. At the same time, the province's air defense forces shot down five US planes. These victories foiled the US imperialists' and their running dogs' schemes of "eating away at" and destroying the liberated areas.

On September 8, local forces and guerrillas in Sam Neua Province bravely intercepted bandits roaming in the Batisi area southwest of Ba Ti, killing eight on the spot and wounding seven, and seizing a batch of weapons and supplies.
