	Two Cleaners
	Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Literary and Art Creation Team  Zhu Min Shen

	Liang Zhi Hong took the broom handed to her by the cleaner Kuang Xiu Qing, holding it tightly in her hands, as if trying to weigh it. Liang Zhi Hong had a deep affection for the broom, not just because a cleaner cherishes her tool, but because a revolutionary recalls a glorious battle history!

	Today, Kuang Xiu Qing's mood was particularly good. Yesterday, she heard that Liang Zhi Hong was coming to work as a cleaner, and she hadn't slept well all night. These two old comrades-in-arms had not worked together since Liang Zhi Hong became an official. Today, they were sweeping the floor together again. This was not just about working together; it was about two hearts being together, about an official's heart being close to the people!

	At this moment, seeing Liang Zhi Hong lost in thought with the broom in her hand, Kuang Xiu Qing asked, "You haven't forgotten this broom, have you?"

	"How could I forget? Before liberation, during the anti-hunger, anti-civil war strike struggle, it was you who thought of this method, hiding the upper-level party's instructions in the broom, avoiding the spy's eyes, and spreading it throughout the entire company's various floors and shops."

	"We must not forget our roots! Realizing communism still requires struggle!"

	The business hall before opening seemed particularly spacious and quiet, with only the sound of the broom sweeping the floor making a "swoosh, swoosh" noise. Liang Zhi Hong swept particularly carefully, as if she was not sweeping away garbage but was forcefully sweeping away the dirty things in her mind. Just now, Kuang Xiu Qing's words made her unable to remain calm: In the cruel struggle, it was Kuang Xiu Qing who introduced her to join the Communist Party of China; under the white terror, it was Kuang Xiu Qing who protected her from escaping the enemy's pursuit. After liberation, this capitalist Globus Department Store was transformed into a socialist state-owned department store, and it was Kuang Xiu Qing who recommended Liang Zhi Hong to take on the position of a commodity department head. At that time, Liang Zhi Hong was afraid she couldn't shoulder the heavy burden, but Kuang Xiu Qing believed in her and encouraged her, saying, "As long as you believe in the people, believe in the Party." A simple sentence made an ordinary cleaner go to replace the original company's director. While Kuang Xiu Qing herself was still a cleaner, she often proudly told others, "I am a cleaner in a socialist store. I sweep the floor to sweep away capitalist garbage, and I wipe the windows to wipe away capitalist dust." This old female worker has been loyal to the Party for twenty years. Thinking of this, Liang Zhi Hong's face felt hot. In recent years, she had spent more time in the office and less time with the people, not listening to comrades' opinions, and instead being influenced by the fallacies of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. If it weren't for this great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, her mind would have strayed further from Mao Zedong Thought and the socialist track.

	At this moment, Liang Zhi Hong swept the floor, step by step, moving closer to Kuang Xiu Qing. At the record counter, their brooms met, and together they swept away the garbage. Before the Cultural Revolution, someone commented that the distance between these two old sisters had widened, but now they were together again. Yes, at the beginning of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was Kuang Xiu Qing who first posted a big-character poster about Liang Zhi Hong, raising issues so sharply! At the on-site criticism meeting in the store, Kuang Xiu Qing faced Liang Zhi Hong and criticized her, with every word hitting the mark. Thinking back now, Liang Zhi Hong truly felt convinced. Take the record counter, for example. In the past, the records sold were either "Hai Rui's Play" or soft songs, emperors and generals, talents and beauties, all capitalist, revisionist, and feudal goods. The business staff had resisted not selling these bad records, but Liang Zhi Hong said: Whatever records the higher-ups produce, we will operate; whatever records people want to buy, we will sell. Where was there any class struggle consciousness? The Proletarian Cultural Revolution shook up the record counter and also shook up Liang Zhi Hong's mind.

	Thinking of these things, Liang Zhi Hong became a bit excited. She asked Kuang Xiu Qing like a little sister asking an older sister, "Feng Qing, do you still trust me?"

	"You?" Kuang Xiu Qing fully understood the thoughts contained in Liang Zhi Hong's question. When the revolutionary committee was established in the store, it was Kuang Xiu Qing who first proposed that Liang Zhi Hong be the first in command of the commodity department revolutionary committee. Her proposal sparked a heated debate. Someone asked, "Comrade Kuang Xiu Qing, you were the first to post a big-character poster about Liang Zhi Hong, and you organized the meeting to criticize Liang Zhi Hong. Today, you propose that Liang Zhi Hong be the first in command. What is your reason?" Kuang Xiu Qing used her long-term battle experience with Liang Zhi Hong to persuade those who still didn't trust Liang Zhi Hong: "We posted big-character posters about Liang Zhi Hong, exposed her, and criticized her, not to knock her down. We did it to help her continue the revolution and walk the socialist path. It's like how we sweep the floor. We sweep away only the garbage, not the wealth that benefits the people."

	Now, Liang Zhi Hong herself raised this question. Kuang Xiu Qing thought for a moment and said warmly and seriously, "Ah Liang, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We should believe in the people, and we should believe in the Party.' As long as we always stay with the people and advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our cause will definitely achieve victory."

	Liang Zhi Hong's gaze became even brighter. She had worked in this store for more than twenty years, but it seemed like today was the first time she felt the store was so bright. On several dozen large pillars in the hall, Mao's quotations were hung, and in a few clean glass showcases, Mao's latest instructions were displayed. The Proletarian Cultural Revolution had changed the entire appearance of the store!

	It was almost time for business, and the store became lively. People walked towards Liang Zhi Hong, some reporting on a task, others raising a suggestion. A meeting of the revolutionary committee was thus convened. Kuang Xiu Qing turned on the lights, and the entire store was red and bright, with Mao's latest instructions shining golden.

    两个清洁工
    上海工人革命文艺创作队  朱敏慎
    梁志红接过清洁工邝秀清递给她的一把扫帚，紧紧握在手里，好象要掂出它的斤两似的。梁志红对于扫帚有着深厚的感情，这不单是出于一个清洁工爱护自己的工具，而且是由于一个革命者记起了一段光辉的战斗历程！
    今天，邝秀清的心情也特别好。昨天，听说梁志红要来当清洁工，使她一夜没睡好。这对老战友，自从梁志红当了干部之后，再也没有在一块劳动过。今天她们又在一起扫地了，这不止是劳动在一块啊！这是两个人的心在一块，是一个干部同群众的心贴在一块了啊！
    此刻邝秀清见梁志红端着扫帚出神，便问道：“没有忘记这把扫帚吧！”
    “怎么忘得了，解放前，那一次反饥饿、反内战罢工斗争，亏你想出这个办法来，把上级党的指示藏在扫帚里，躲过了狗特务的贼眼，传遍了整个公司的各楼商场。”
    “不能忘本啊！实现共产主义还有斗争哪！”
    营业前的商场，显得特别宽广，格外安静，只听得扫帚掠过地板发出的“嘶、嘶”声。梁志红扫得特别认真，她用力扫的好象不是垃圾，而是在用力扫掉自己头脑里的脏东西。刚才邝秀清的话使她不能平静：在残酷的斗争中，是邝秀清介绍她参加了中国共产党；在白色恐怖下，是邝秀清掩护她摆脱敌人的钉梢。解放后，这个资本主义的环球百货公司，转为社会主义的国营百货商店，又是邝秀清，推荐梁志红去担任一个商品部的主任。那时候，梁志红怕挑不起这副重担子，可是邝秀清相信她，鼓励她说：“只要相信群众，相信党。”一句朴素的话，使一个普通清洁工去代替了原来大公司的部长。而邝秀清自己，还是一个清洁工，她却常常自豪地对别人说：“我是一个社会主义商店里的清洁工，我扫地，是扫掉资本主义的垃圾，我揩橱窗，是擦掉资本主义的灰尘。”这个老年女工二十年如一日，对党赤胆忠心。梁志红想到这里，脸上热呼呼的。这几年，自己坐办公室多了，同群众接近少了，同志们的意见听不进，反而接受了党内一小撮走资派的谬论的影响，要不是这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，自己的头脑离开毛泽东思想、离开社会主义的轨道将会更远了。
    这会儿，梁志红扫着地，一步一步地向邝秀清靠拢，在唱片柜台前，两个人的扫帚碰到一块了，共同把垃圾铲掉。文化大革命前有人议论说，这对老姊妹的距离拉远了，现在她们又粘在一块了。是的，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，又是邝秀清，第一个贴了梁志红的大字报，问题提得那么尖锐！在商场里的现场批判会上，邝秀清面对面地批判梁志红，一句话象一枚针，针针见血。现在想起来，梁志红真是口服心服。就说唱片柜台吧，过去卖的唱片，不是“海瑞戏”，就是软绵绵的歌曲、帝王将相、才子佳人，尽是封、资、修的货色。营业员同志曾经抵制不卖这种坏唱片，梁志红却说：上面出什么唱片，我们就经营什么唱片，人家要买什么唱片，我们就卖什么唱片。这那里还有一点阶级斗争的观念？无产阶级文化大革命冲击了唱片柜，也冲击了梁志红的头脑。
    想起这些，梁志红有点激动，她好象一个小妹子问大姐姐一样：“秀清，你还信得过我不？”
    “你？”邝秀清完全理解梁志红在这句问话里所包含的全部思想。在商店建立革命委员会的时候，又是邝秀清首先提议梁志红当商品部革委会的第一把手。她的提议引起了一场热烈的争论。人家问：“邝秀清同志，梁志红的大字报是你第一个贴的，批判梁志红的会议是你组织的，今天，你又提议梁志红当第一把手，你的理由呢？”邝秀清以自己同梁志红长期的战斗经历去说服那些还信不过梁志红的人们：“我们贴梁志红的大字报，揭发她，批判她，不是为了把她打倒，我们为的是要帮助她继续革命，走社会主义的道路。就象我们扫地一样，我们扫掉的只是垃圾，而不是扫掉对人民有利的财富。”
    现在，梁志红自己也提出了这个问题，邝秀清沉思了一会，亲切而又严肃地说道：“阿梁，毛主席教导说：‘我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党’。只要我们永远和群众在一起，沿着毛主席的革命路线前进，我们的事业就一定能够取得胜利”。
    梁志红的眼光更加明亮了。她在这个商店里工作了二十多年，仿佛今天才觉得商场是那么的光亮，几十根大庭柱上，都挂着毛主席语录，几座明净的玻璃橱里，陈列着毛主席的最新指示。无产阶级文化大革命，改变了整个商场的面貌！
    营业时间快到了，商场里热闹起来。人们朝梁志红这边走来，有的汇报一项工作，有的提一条意见，一个革委会的碰头会就这样开起来了。邝秀清开亮了电灯，整个商场红彤彤的，毛主席的最新指示更加金光闪闪。
