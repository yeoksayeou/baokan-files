The editorial and investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" published in the _Red Flag_ magazine have attracted the high attention and enthusiastic welcome of the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country. In study sessions, the broad masses of workers and peasants have gained great enlightenment. They said, the editorial and investigative report of the _Red Flag_ magazine spoke the hearts of us workers and peasants, greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat, and greatly suppressed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. We must definitely follow the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao and carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end. The masses of workers and peasants in various places pointed out that the policy towards old and new intellectuals in the humanities and sciences proposed in the editorial of the _Red Flag_ magazine is a proletarian policy that must be seriously implemented in carrying out the education revolution. They expressed that they must use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals and help them walk the path of integrating with the masses of workers and peasants. Below are several articles written by workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals from various places.

	Grasp the Printing Press Tightly and Carry Out the Proletarian Education Revolution to the End
	Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team Stationed at Tsinghua University

	The important editorial and investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" in the third issue of the _Red Flag_ magazine spoke the hearts of the working class and the broad masses of laborers. We, the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Tsinghua University, enthusiastically support and resolutely implement it!

	Tsinghua, this so-called famous technical college, has long been a place where the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has been extremely sharp and complex. The Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, in order to restore capitalism, gathered a small group of capitalist-roaders, spies, and traitors at Tsinghua University, and tried to turn Tsinghua University into a place to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, holding high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," rebelled against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents at Tsinghua, giving a heavy blow to the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie. However, a small group of class enemies are not reconciled to their failure. They hide in the dark, spread evil winds, and stir up trouble, trying to sabotage the proletarian education revolution. Can we, the working class, ignore this serious situation? Absolutely not!

	Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "To carry out the proletarian education revolution, we must have the leadership of the working class, we must have the participation of the masses of workers, and we must cooperate with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and with the active elements among the students, teachers, and staff in the schools who are determined to carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end, to implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, and forever lead the schools." Chairman Mao's latest instructions completely hit the spot for us workers. We, the working class, must occupy the educational front that has long been dominated by bourgeois intellectuals.

	The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the schools to lead the education revolution is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao. However, some people look down on us workers. They say, "Schools are places to learn knowledge. Workers don't understand education. What are they doing in schools?" We want to tell these "gentlemen" to put away your tricks! If you want to talk about how to eat, drink, and play, about fame and fortune, we, the working class, indeed don't understand and don't need to. What we understand and need is the educational chapter of Mao Zedong Thought, the educational chapter of serving the people wholeheartedly, the educational chapter of being forever loyal to the Party, to the people, and to Chairman Mao. Those gentlemen who say that the working class doesn't understand education, we advise you to honestly learn from the working class, learn how the working class practices and applies Mao Zedong Thought, and how they use Mao Zedong Thought to change the world in the three great revolutionary movements. Otherwise, your future is not bright!

	Tsinghua University has a lot of intellectuals. To truly cultivate reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, this monopoly by intellectuals must be broken! The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams must enter! It's like a piece of clay, only by mixing in sand to form a "granular structure" can good crops grow. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the university is the key to ensuring that the leadership power in the school is forever in the hands of the proletariat, a great strategic measure to ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies the school's front. We, the working class, are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and we understand and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We enter Tsinghua to ensure that every latest instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters is quickly and smoothly implemented in Tsinghua University. We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, thoroughly reform the bourgeois old educational system, and let Mao Zedong Thought completely occupy the school's front.

	The important editorial of the _Red Flag_ magazine points out: "For the large number of graduates from colleges and secondary schools who have been working and are currently working, attention should be paid to re-educating them and making them integrate with workers and peasants." The Party's policy on intellectuals has always been clear. Since we entered Tsinghua University, a small group of class enemies have deliberately distorted our Party's firm and clear policy on intellectuals, trying to sabotage the unity between the working class and revolutionary intellectuals. We must smash this plot. For intellectuals who are determined to integrate with the masses of workers and peasants, we warmly welcome and firmly support them. For those intellectuals who can still be reformed, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to reform them and help them walk the broad path of integrating with the masses of workers and peasants. We are determined to organize a vast army of the education revolution with Mao Zedong Thought, unite the majority, and strike down a small handful. We must unite and fight with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University, and swear to carry out the proletarian education revolution in Tsinghua University to the end!

	Technical Personnel Must Integrate with Workers and Peasants
	The 200,000x Electron Microscope Trial Manufacturers Cao Muquan and Zhang Shi

	We studied the extremely important editorial and the investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" in the third issue of the _Red Flag_ magazine in 1968, and received great education, great encouragement, and great inspiration. This editorial and investigative report spoke the hearts of the working class, greatly boosted the morale of the working class, and greatly suppressed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie! The two of us are the graduates of Shanghai Mechanical School mentioned in this investigative report who were responsible for the research and trial manufacturing of China's first 200,000x electron microscope.

	Looking back, in the old society, we both started working in factories in our teens and suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the capitalists. After liberation, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we stood up. In 1952, the Party sent us to Shanghai Mechanical School for training. The learning process was not smooth sailing. The capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals in the school looked down on us workers and ridiculed and attacked us. However, we were determined not to let down Chairman Mao's care and to make Chairman Mao proud, and we persisted in studying until graduation. After graduation, we were assigned to work in a research institute and later took on the leadership of the research room and trial manufacturing workshop, and were responsible for the research and trial manufacturing of China's first 200,000x large electron microscope.

	This advanced precision instrument was jointly trial-manufactured by workers and a few revolutionary technical personnel. In the trial manufacturing process, the worker masters played a leading role. The trial manufacturing of this advanced precision instrument has extremely high technical requirements. When we started the trial manufacturing, the Soviet revisionists sneered at us, saying, "You Chinese want to make electron microscopes? Wait another ten years." We heard this and were so angry that our lungs almost burst. Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," we were determined to successfully trial-manufacture the large electron microscope, to make Chairman Mao proud, to make the country proud, and to refute the Soviet modern revisionists. In the trial manufacturing process, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overcome one difficulty after another. For example, the "extreme shoe" of the electron microscope, which is considered the heart of the electron microscope, has extremely high processing precision requirements. However, our institute only has ordinary machine tools, which cannot process it. What should we do? We did not look for those foreign "experts," but went to the workshop and discussed with the worker masters. The worker masters found an "old machine tool," and with their own hands, they completely transformed it, finally processing the "extreme shoe" that meets the precision requirements. The "lens tube" part of the electron microscope requires a high vacuum, but the lens tube part is composed of hundreds of components, with many joints and gaps, and some components need to be silver-soldered with very high technical difficulty. We discussed with our worker comrades, came up with ideas, and launched a large cooperation among various trades, fully mobilizing the creativity of our worker comrades, and successfully broke through this difficulty.

	In the process of researching and trial-manufacturing the 200,000x electron microscope, we came into contact with many revolutionary intellectuals who were willing to integrate with workers and played a role in the research and trial manufacturing process. They worked with workers, humbly learned from worker comrades. The heroic spirit of worker comrades fighting for the country's honor and catching up with the international advanced level educated them greatly. The rich practical experience of worker masters corrected many mistakes made by technical personnel with only book knowledge in the design aspect, making these intellectuals of student origin feel deeply respectful. In the process of working and trial manufacturing with workers, they established deep feelings, and worker comrades were very willing to help them enthusiastically in their thoughts and work.

	However, there were also a few reactionary "authorities" who stubbornly insisted on the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, looked down on workers, and were not willing to integrate with workers. There was a person in our institute who was praised by the capitalist-roader in charge as a "contributor" to the large electron microscope, but he did not even understand the performance of the electron microscope and could not even repair it when it broke down. The more than ten research projects he led in design did not succeed in trial manufacturing, wasting a large amount of state property.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the masses of workers and peasants, will achieve nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to integrate with the masses of workers and peasants." Countless facts tell us that all revolutionary intellectuals must resolutely walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, put down their airs, and humbly learn from the working class, thoroughly reform their worldview, and only then can they make contributions in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment; otherwise, they will achieve nothing and may even fall into the swamp of opposing the masses of workers and peasants.

	We, the Working Class, Must Forever Hold the Leadership Power of the Schools
	The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Tianjin Sanjiao Shi

	The _Red Flag_ magazine published in its third issue of 1968 the investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" and issued an important editorial on it. We, the working class of Sanjiao Shi, were overjoyed after reading it!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." We, the working class of Sanjiao Shi, deeply understand the importance of "power" from our personal experiences in the old society. As Lin Biao pointed out: "With power, the proletariat and the laboring people have everything. Without power, they lose everything." In the past, we were thrown into the hell of Sanjiao Shi from childhood, working like beasts of burden for the exploiting classes year after year. The evil capitalists treated us as "speaking machines," not only oppressing and exploiting us politically and economically, but also depriving us of the right to learn culture. At that time, we were always hungry and cold, suffering endless bullying and torture, let alone talking about learning culture! As for going to school to study, we didn't even dare to dream about it. The wealth and culture of the world were originally created by us, the working class and the laboring people, but they were monopolized by the exploiting classes in the old society. In the final analysis, it was because the exploiting classes were the rulers, and we, the working class, did not hold power.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao led the working class and the laboring people to make a revolution, saving us from the hell of being eaten alive, and we stood up to become masters. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, with his wolfish ambitions, tried to restore capitalism in China, crazily promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, attempting to turn socialist schools into their bases for cultivating successors of the bourgeoisie, allowing bourgeois intellectuals to long dominate schools, and excluding workers, peasants, and soldiers from the school gates, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over us laboring people. The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines experienced by Shanghai Mechanical Institute is a vivid example.

	Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the proletarian education revolution sounded the advance signal for the working class to occupy the educational front. We, the working class of Sanjiao Shi, with our deep proletarian feelings of infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, form the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and under the unified arrangement of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee, enter 14 large and small schools, and carry out the education revolution with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff there. We are determined to firmly hold the leadership power of the schools in the hands of the working class and turn the history that has been turned upside down back to its right side.

	We must follow the important policies and guidelines pointed out in the editorial of the _Red Flag_ magazine and learn from the valuable experiences proposed in the investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges," combine them with the specific conditions of each unit, and push the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the educational front to a new high. We, the working class, not only must firmly hold the leadership power of the schools politically and organizationally, but also must hold power ideologically, leading the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line with Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on the educational front!

	Put Down Your Airs and Be a Student of the Workers
	Li Ji, Shenyang Smelting Plant

	I am the son of a poor peasant. In 1964, I graduated from school and was assigned to work at the Shenyang Smelting Plant. Recently, I, together with the worker masters, successfully created a set of production equipment for a rare metal with world advanced level, solving a long-standing problem in our plant's production. I deeply felt from practice that the path of integrating with workers and peasants pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao is the only correct path for us.

	On this issue, I have suffered. When I first came to the plant, due to the long-term influence of bourgeois education, I had serious thoughts of fame and fortune. I always thought, "This time, let's work hard and see if we can make a name for ourselves. Maybe in a few years, we can become an engineer!" Therefore, I spent all day recording data and reading books, rarely contacting the masses of workers, and rarely touching the actual production. As a result, not only did I not achieve anything, but I was not even familiar with normal operations. When worker masters asked me some specific questions about production, I couldn't answer clearly. Why was this? I couldn't find the answer for a long time.

	Chairman Mao said: "Without a heart full of enthusiasm, without the determination to look down, without the desire to learn, without the spirit of putting down airs and being a student, one will definitely not be able to do it and definitely will not be able to do it well." After studying Chairman Mao's works, I finally opened my mind. The main problem was that my thoughts were wrong, and my direction was wrong!

	Last March, our factory and workshop revolutionary committees were born in the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, the factory revolutionary committee gave me a task to reform a set of equipment with the worker masters. This set of equipment was originally set up by the Soviet revisionist "experts" and the reactionary technical authorities in our factory, with extremely bad production conditions. The production site was filled with poisonous smoke, and the high temperature of the furnace roasted people until they sweated like rain. The worker comrades had raised many opinions about this problem in the past, but it was never solved. The worker masters said: Now that we have overthrown the capitalist-roaders and reactionary authorities, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat has taken power. Can we still let this poisonous smoke furnace continue to harm us? No! Absolutely not!

	The reform work began, and the worker masters and I studied together Chairman Mao's teaching: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's teaching and the help of the worker masters, I overcame the wrong thought of fearing that the reform would not succeed and that people would say that my seventeen years of study were in vain and that I would have no face to show. I decided to put down my airs and humbly learn from the workers. I moved to the workshop, eating, studying, and working with the worker masters, researching and experimenting together. After I mixed with the workers, the worker masters were very happy. They said: "How much dust is on our bodies, how much dust is on Xiao Li's body, we, the working class, like such college students." The experimental work was busy day and night, but our mood was very happy, and the more we did, the more energetic we became.

	In the process of the experiment, we encountered many difficulties. A small group of class enemies mocked us as "toads wanting to eat swan meat," saying that "a few earth workers can do what!" We were not discouraged at all and were determined to refute the attacks and slanders of the class enemies with actual actions. The worker masters said well: "We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we can overcome any difficulty and create any miracle." When we encountered difficulties, we studied Chairman Mao's brilliant "On Practice" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In this way, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the boundless wisdom and strength of the masses of workers, we only took two months to successfully create a brand-new set of automated equipment, solving the long-standing problem of smoke pollution and heatstroke in our factory for more than ten years, improving product quality, and reducing the loss of rare metals. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

	After studying the important editorial and investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" in the _Red Flag_ magazine, I was greatly encouraged. I deeply felt that only by firmly following Chairman Mao's teachings, putting down airs, and walking the path of integrating with workers and peasants, can intellectuals have a bright future.

	We Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Warmly Welcome Intellectuals Who Integrate with Workers and Peasants
	Geng Changsuo, National Agricultural Labor Model and Vice Chairman of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee

	The important editorial and investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute: On the Educational Revolution in Technical Colleges" in the _Red Flag_ magazine spoke the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class. We must definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly take charge of the educational cause in the countryside, manage it well, and truly turn it into a red base for cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The countryside is a vast land, and revolutionary intellectuals can achieve great things here. We warmly welcome intellectuals to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants and build a new socialist countryside with us.

	In recent years, a large number of educated youth have gone to the mountains and countryside to participate in the socialist revolution and construction. Most of them have been able to listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and grow politically and ideologically, making due contributions in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. However, there are also some who, due to the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "studying to become an official" and "going to the countryside to become an official," have their hearts in the countryside but their minds in the cities. They are not firm in class struggle and cannot stand up to it. We do not trust such intellectuals.

	The working class and we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, suffered the most oppression and deepest exploitation in the old society, so we hate the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev the most, love the new society and Chairman Mao the most, and are most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Intellectuals can only walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, humbly learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, increase proletarian feelings, and thoroughly reform the bourgeois worldview.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." The working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants have rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Intellectuals can only integrate with workers and peasants to be tempered and improved in the three great revolutionary movements and gradually grow into "socialist-conscious laborers with culture."

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to integrate with the masses of workers and peasants." We warmly hope that all intellectuals who want to revolutionize will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly reform their worldview, truly move their standpoint to the side of workers and peasants, sincerely regard workers and peasants as teachers, humbly learn from workers and peasants, and grow healthily on the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

    沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向
    把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    新华社五日讯　《红旗》杂志的重要编者按和调查报告《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》发表以后，引起了全国各地广大工人群众、贫下中农和革命知识分子的高度重视，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。各地广大工农群众在学习座谈中得到了很大启发。他们说，《红旗》杂志重要编者按和调查报告，说出了我们工农的心里话，大长无产阶级的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风。我们一定要沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。各地的工农群众指出，《红旗》杂志编者按里提出的对文科、理科新旧知识分子的政策，是我们进行教育革命必须认真贯彻执行的无产阶级政策。他们表示，一定要用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，帮助他们走与工农群众相结合的道路。下面是各地工人、贫下中农和革命的知识分子写的几篇文章。
    握紧印把子，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队
    《红旗》杂志第三期的重要编者按和调查报告《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》，说出了我们工人阶级和广大劳动人民的心里话。我们首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队热烈拥护，坚决贯彻！
    清华这个所谓有名的理工科大学，长期以来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直非常尖锐复杂。中国赫鲁晓夫以及彭真反革命修正主义集团为了复辟资本主义，纠集清华大学一小撮走资派以及特务、叛徒，极力把清华大学变成培养资产阶级接班人的场所。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生员工，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，造了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在清华代理人的反，给了资产阶级反动势力以沉重的打击。但是，一小撮阶级敌人对他们的失败并不甘心。他们躲在阴沟洞里，煽邪风，点鬼火，挑动群众斗群众，妄图破坏无产阶级教育革命的进行。这种严重情况，我们工人阶级能不管吗？绝对不能！
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”毛主席的最新指示，完完全全说到了我们工人的心坎上。我们工人阶级就是要占领长期以来被资产阶级知识分子统治的教育阵地。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进学校领导教育革命，这是毛主席的伟大战略部署。可是有些人就是瞧不起我们这些工人。他们说什么“学校是学知识的地方，工人不懂教育，跑到学校来干什么？”我们要告诉这些“先生”们，还是收起你们那一套吧！要讲怎样吃喝玩乐，成名成家，我们工人阶级确实不懂，也不需要。我们所懂的，所需要的，就是毛泽东思想的教育篇，全心全意为人民服务的教育篇，永远忠于党、永远忠于人民、永远忠于毛主席的教育篇。说工人阶级不懂教育的先生们，奉劝你们还是老老实实地向工人阶级学习，学学工人阶级是怎样活学活用毛泽东思想，怎样运用毛泽东思想在三大革命运动中改天换地的真本事吧！否则，你们的前途是并不美妙的！
    清华大学这样的学校，知识分子成堆。要真正能够培养出无产阶级革命事业可靠接班人，这种知识分子垄断的“一统天下”必须打破！必须开进工人毛泽东思想宣传队！这就象一块粘土疙瘩的地，只有掺上沙子，形成“团粒结构”，才能长出好庄稼。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进大学，这是从组织上保证学校的领导大权永远掌握在无产阶级手中的关键，是保证毛泽东思想占领学校阵地的伟大战略措施。我们工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，对伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示理解的执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行。我们进清华，就是要保证毛主席的每一个最新指示、无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，迅速地畅通地在清华大学得到贯彻执行。我们一定要彻底批判反革命修正主义的教育路线，彻底改革资产阶级的旧教育制度，让毛泽东思想完全占领学校阵地。
    《红旗》杂志的重要编者按指出：“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。”党的知识分子政策历来是很清楚的。我们进驻清华大学以来，一小撮阶级敌人极力歪曲我们党的坚定明确的知识分子政策，妄图破坏工人阶级和革命的知识分子的团结，我们一定要粉碎这种阴谋。对于决心与工农群众相结合的革命的知识分子，我们热烈欢迎，坚决支持。对于那些还可能改造的知识分子，我们一定要用毛泽东思想改造他们，帮助他们走上与工农群众相结合的康庄大道。我们决心用毛泽东思想组织起一支浩浩荡荡的教育革命大军，团结大多数，打击一小撮。我们一定要同清华大学革命的红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工团结、战斗在一起，誓把清华大学的无产阶级教育革命进行到底！科技人员必须同工农相结合二十万倍大型电子显微镜试制工作者　曹木泉　张　石
    我们学习了《红旗》杂志一九六八年第三期的极为重要的编者按和《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》的调查报告，受到了极大的教育，极大的鼓舞，极大的鞭策。这篇编者按和调查报告说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风！我们两人，就是这篇调查报告中提到的负责研究试制我国第一台二十万倍电子显微镜工作的、上海机器制造学校的毕业生。
    回想过去，在旧社会，我们两人都是十几岁就进工厂做工，受尽了资本家的剥削和压迫。解放后，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我们翻了身。一九五二年，党又把我们送进上海机器制造学校培养。在学习中，并不是一帆风顺的。学校的走资派和资产阶级知识分子看不起我们工人，对我们进行讽刺打击。但是，我们决心不辜负毛主席的关怀，一定要为毛主席争气，一直坚持学习到毕业。毕业后，我们分配到一个研究所工作，后来又分别担任了研究室和试制车间的领导工作，并且负责我国第一台二十万倍大型电子显微镜的研究和试制工作。
    这台高级精密仪器，是由工人同少数革命科技人员一起试制成功的。在试制过程中，工人老师傅起了主导作用。这台高级精密仪器，试制技术要求极高。当我们开始试制时，苏修讥讽我们说：“你们中国要搞电子显微镜，还是等十年以后再说吧。”我们一听到这句话，连肺都气炸了。我们根据毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，下决心一定要把大型电子显微镜试制成功，为毛主席争气，为祖国争光，回击苏联现代修正主义者。在试制过程中，我们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，克服了一个又一个困难。例如被称为电子显微镜心脏的“极靴”，加工精度要求非常高，可是我们所里都是一些普通的机床，无法加工，怎么办？我们不是去找那些洋“专家”，而是到车间和工人老师傅一起商量。工人老师傅找了一台“老爷机床”，自己动手，对它进行了脱胎换骨的改造，终于加工出了符合精度要求的“极靴”。电子显微镜的“镜筒”部分，需要高真空，但是镜筒部分是由几百个零件组合起来的，接头多，缝隙多，同时有些零件需进行技术难度很高的“银焊”。我们同工人同志一起想办法，出主意，并且开展了各工种之间的大协作，充分发挥了工人同志的创造性，胜利地突破了这一难关。
    在二十万倍电子显微镜的研究和试制过程中，我们接触到不少革命的知识分子，他们愿意同工人相结合，在研究和试制过程中也发挥了作用。他们同工人一起劳动，虚心向工人同志学习。工人同志为祖国争气、赶超国际先进水平的英雄气概，使他们受到很大教育。工人老师傅丰富的实践经验，纠正了不少只有书本知识的技术人员在设计方面的错误，使这些学生出身的科技人员从心里感到佩服。他们在同工人一起劳动和试制的过程中，建立了深厚的感情，工人同志很愿意在思想和工作上对他们进行热情的帮助。
    但是，也有极少数反动的技术“权威”，顽固地坚持资产阶级的反动立场，看不起工人，不愿同工人相结合。有个被所内走资派捧为所谓大型电子显微镜“有功人员”的人，却根本不懂得电子显微镜的性能，连电子显微镜坏了都不会修理。他领导设计的其他十多个研究项目，没有一个试制成功，浪费了国家大量财产。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”无数的事实告诉我们，一切要革命的知识分子，只有坚决走同工农相结合的道路，放下架子，老老实实向工人阶级学习，彻底改造自己的世界观，才能在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中有所贡献；否则必将一事无成，甚至会滑到反对工农群众的臭泥坑中去。
    我们工人阶级要永远掌握
    学校的领导大权
    天津市三条石工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    《红旗》杂志一九六八年第三期刊登了《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》的调查报告，并就此发表了重要的编者按。我们三条石的工人阶级读了以后，心里高兴极了！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”我们三条石的工人阶级，从在旧社会亲身经历过的血泪史中，深深体会到“权”的重要。正象林副主席所指出的那样：“有了政权，无产阶级、劳动人民就有了一切。没有政权就丧失一切。”过去，我们从童年起就被打进三条石的人间地狱，成年累月为剥削阶级当牛做马。万恶的资本家把我们当作“会说话的机器”，不光在政治上和经济上对我们进行残酷的压迫和剥削，而且剥夺了我们学文化的权利。那时，我们终日吃不饱穿不暖，受尽欺压折磨，那里还说得上学文化！对于上学读书，简直连做梦都没有想过。世界上的财富和文化，本来都是我们工人阶级和劳动人民创造出来的，但它们在旧社会却被剥削阶级独霸去了。归根结底，就是由于剥削阶级是统治者，我们工人阶级没有掌握政权。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席领导工人阶级和劳动人民闹革命，从吃人的火坑中把我们拯救出来，翻身当了主人。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫怀着狼子野心，企图在中国复辟资本主义，疯狂推行反革命修正主义教育路线，妄想把社会主义的学校变成他们培养资产阶级接班人的阵地，让资产阶级知识分子长期统治学校，拒工农兵于学校大门之外，对我们劳动人民实行资产阶级专政。上海机械学院所经历的一场惊心动魄的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就是一个活生生的例子。
    毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列最新指示，吹响了工人阶级占领教育阵地的进军号。我们三条石的工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，遵照毛主席的教导，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在天津市革命委员会的统一安排下，开进了十四所大、中学校，同那里的革命师生员工一道，进行教育革命。我们决心把学校的领导大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手中，把被颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来。
    我们一定要遵照《红旗》杂志编者按指出的重要方针政策和学习《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》这篇调查报告中提出的宝贵经验，结合各单位的具体情况，把教育战线的斗、批、改推向高潮。我们工人阶级不但要在政治上、组织上牢牢掌握学校的领导大权，还要在思想上掌好权，要领导革命的师生员工，用毛泽东思想彻底批判反革命修正主义教育路线，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在教育阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    放下架子，甘当工人的小学生
    沈阳冶炼厂　李　季
    我是一个贫农的儿子。一九六四年从学校毕业，被分配到沈阳冶炼厂工作。最近，我和工人师傅一起，创造成功了一套具有世界先进水平的生产一种稀有金属的新设备，解决了我们厂生产上一个“老大难”问题。我从实践中深刻地体会到，伟大领袖毛主席指出的知识分子与工农相结合的道路，是我们的唯一正确的道路。
    在这个问题上，我是吃过苦头的。刚来厂时，由于我长期受资产阶级教育的影响，名利思想很严重。心里总想：“这回好好大干一场，说不定弄出点名堂，几年就可以当个工程师呢！”因此，我整天记数据，看书本，很少联系工人群众，很少接触生产实际。结果，不但一点名堂都没弄出来，甚至连正常操作都不熟悉。工人师傅问我一些生产中的具体问题时，我都说不清楚。这是为什么呢？我很长一段时间得不出答案。
    毛主席说：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”学习毛主席著作以后，我才开了心窍。主要是思想不对头，方向搞错啦！
    去年三月，我们工厂和车间的革命委员会在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中胜利诞生了。在抓革命、促生产中，厂革委会给我一项任务，和工人师傅一起，共同改革一套设备。这套设备是过去苏修“专家”与我厂反动技术权威搞起来的，生产条件极端恶劣。生产现场毒烟迷漫，炉子的高温把人烤得流汗如雨。对这个问题，工人同志过去提了很多意见，但是一直没有解决。工人师傅说：现在我们打倒了走资派和反动权威，无产阶级革命派掌了权，还能让这个毒烟炉继续毒害我们吗？不能！绝对不能！
    改革工作开始了，工人师傅和我一起学习了毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”在毛主席的教导鼓舞下，在工人师傅们的帮助下，我克服了怕改革不成人家说我十七年书白念、脸没处放的错误思想。我决心放下臭架子，老老实实拜工人为师。我搬到车间里去，与工人师傅们同吃、同学习、同劳动，一起研究，共同试验。我同工人滚在一起以后，工人师傅们很高兴。他们说：“我们身上有多少灰，小李身上有多少灰，咱们工人阶级就是喜欢这样的大学生。”试验工作昼夜忙着，但我们心情非常愉快，越干越有劲。
    在试验的过程中，我们碰到很多困难。一小撮阶级敌人嘲笑我们是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，胡说什么“几个土工人能搞出什么名堂！”我们一点都没灰心，决心以实际行动回击阶级敌人的攻击和诬蔑。工人师傅说得好：“我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么困难都可以克服，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。”我们碰到困难，就学习毛主席光辉的《实践论》，学习《愚公移山》。就这样，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠工人群众无穷无尽的智慧和力量，仅仅用了两个月的时间，我们终于创造出一套崭新的自动化设备，解决了十几年来我厂反动技术权威无法解决的烟害、火烤的“老大难”问题，提高了产品质量，减少了稀有金属的流失。这是毛泽东思想的胜利！是毛主席革命路线的胜利！
    学习了《红旗》杂志的重要编者按和调查报告《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》，我受到了很大鼓舞。我深深体会到：只有坚定地按照毛主席的教导，放下臭架子，走与工农相结合的道路，才是知识分子的光明大道。
    我们贫下中农热烈欢迎和工农结合的知识分子
    全国农业劳动模范、河北省革委会副主任　耿长锁
    《红旗》杂志重要编者按和调查报告《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。我们贫下中农是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决把农村的教育事业管起来，管理好，使它真正成为培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的红色阵地。
    农村是一个广阔的天地，革命的知识分子到农村来大有作为。我们热烈欢迎知识分子走和工农相结合的道路，同我们一起建设社会主义的新农村。
    这些年来，有大批的知识青年上山下乡，到农村参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。他们当中的绝大多数人，都能够听毛主席的话，坚决走和工农相结合的道路，虚心向贫下中农学习，在政治上和思想上不断成长，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中作出了应有的贡献。但是，也有一些人由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫“读书做官”、“下乡做官”谬论的毒害，人在农村，心向城市。他们在阶级斗争中站不稳，顶不住。我们对这样的知识分子，就是不放心。
    工人阶级和我们贫下中农在旧社会受压迫最重，受剥削最深，所以我们对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫最恨，对新社会和毛主席最爱，对毛泽东思想最忠。知识分子只有走同工农相结合的道路，虚心向工人和贫下中农学习，才能增加无产阶级的感情，彻底改造资产阶级的世界观。
    毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”工人阶级和贫下中农，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，有着丰富的实践经验。知识分子只有同工农结合，才能在三大革命运动中得到锻炼和提高，逐步成长为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”我们热烈地希望一切愿意革命的知识分子，都能够读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事，坚决改造自己的世界观，把立足点真正移到工农这方面来，真心诚意地拜工农为师，老老实实地向工农学习，沿着毛主席指引的道路健康成长。
