Paris students, overcoming all difficulties, persist in boycotting exams

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, Paris: The Paris students' just struggle against France's decaying bourgeois education system and the government's suppression of the student movement is continuing to develop. On the 19th, one thousand university students held a protest meeting at the University of Paris and marched in protest afterward. On the 17th, students at the Paris School of Fine Arts occupied their school and hoisted a bright red flag on the school building once again.

The Paris students' exam boycott, which began on September 5th, has persisted for half a month. In recent days, Paris students, undeterred by police threats and unfooled by sweet talk, have continued their spirited struggle against the decaying education and examination system both inside and outside the exam halls.

On the 19th, hundreds of students gathered in front of the University of Paris Medical School to express strong protests against the French government. In the evening of the 19th, one thousand students held a meeting at the main campus of the University of Paris. Students and faculty representatives spoke at the meeting, exposing France's decaying bourgeois education system, condemning the government's use of violence to suppress the student movement, and strongly opposing the entry of police and informants into schools. After the meeting, the students sang "The Internationale" and held a demonstration march in the Paris University area on the left bank of the Seine River.

During the revolutionary storm that swept France in May and June this year, students from the Paris School of Fine Arts produced a large number of slogans and posters, which were plastered all over the school. These students actively participated in the exam boycott. On the 17th, students from this school once again occupied the school, hoisted a red flag on the school building, and hung a large banner that read: "No police, liberate the school." They passed a resolution demanding a thorough reform of France's decaying education system and the withdrawal of police and informants from all French universities.

The French authorities, terrified, quickly dispatched trucks carrying large numbers of police to surround the School of Fine Arts, preventing other students from entering the school, and not allowing students to supply food to their fellow students who had occupied the school. However, the students who occupied the School of Fine Arts were not intimidated. They stood in front of the school building, singing "The Internationale" and shouting slogans such as "Down with the police state" and other condemnations of the government and police.

On the evening of the 17th, the French reactionary ruling clique ordered the police to use violence to drive the students out of the School of Fine Arts. The students bravely fought back. As they were forced to leave the school, they angrily shouted: "This is just the beginning, the struggle will continue!"

    把反对资产阶级腐朽教育制度的斗争继续下去
    巴黎学生排除万难坚持罢考
    据新华社二十日讯巴黎消息：巴黎学生反对法国腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，反对政府镇压学生运动的正义斗争正在继续发展。一千名大学生十九日在巴黎大学举行抗议大会，并在会后游行示威。巴黎美术学院的学生，十七日占领了他们的学院，在学院的建筑物上又一次升起鲜艳的红旗。
    从九月五日开始的巴黎学生的罢考斗争，到今天已坚持了半个月。连日来，巴黎学生不顾警察的威胁，不受甜言蜜语的欺骗，继续斗志昂扬地在考场内外坚持抵制腐朽的教育和考试制度的斗争。
    十九日整天，数百名学生聚集在巴黎大学医学院门前，向法国政府表示强烈的抗议。十九日晚上，一千名学生在巴黎大学本部开会。学生和教员的代表在会上纷纷发言，揭露法国腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，谴责政府使用暴力镇压学生运动，并强烈反对警察和密探进入学校。会后，学生们高唱《国际歌》，在塞纳河左岸的巴黎大学区举行示威游行。
    今年五、六月革命风暴席卷法国期间，曾经制作了大量标语和招贴画，贴遍了巴黎的美术学院的学生，积极参加了罢考斗争的行列。十七日，这个学院的学生又一次占领了学院，在学院大楼上升起红旗，并且挂起一幅巨大的横幅标语，上面写着：“不要警察，解放学院”。他们通过决议，要求彻底改革法国腐朽的教育制度，要求从法国各大学撤走警察和密探。
    法国当局怕得要命，连忙用卡车运来大批警察，包围了美术学院，阻止其他学生进入这个学校，并且不让学生给占领学院的同学供应食物。可是，占领美术学院的学生并没有被吓倒，他们站在学院大楼前，高唱《国际歌》，高呼“打倒警察国家”，以及其他谴责政府和警察的口号。
    十七日晚上，法国反动统治集团下令警察使用暴力把美术学院的学生赶出学校。学生们同警察进行了英勇的搏斗。学生们在被迫离开学院时愤慨地高呼：“这只不过是开始，战斗要继续进行下去！”
