The 1968 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair is scheduled to be held from October 15 to November 15 in Guangzhou.

This year's autumn session of the China Export Commodities Fair is being held amidst a great situation both at home and abroad. Currently, the revolutionary movements of the world's people are surging like a storm, and U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are facing internal and external difficulties, making their days very tough. In our great socialist motherland, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are striding forward with mighty steps, closely following the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform, and advancing steadily on the road to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The working class and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our country are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," channeling the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, and driving the vigorous development of our country's industrial and agricultural production. The variety of industrial products is increasing, and production is continuously rising. Agriculture, on the basis of six consecutive years of bumper harvests, has again achieved a bumper harvest this summer. The development of industrial and agricultural production has provided a more abundant material foundation for this year's autumn session of the China Export Commodities Fair.

The staff and cadres of the Fair and related departments, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and are determined to make this session of the Fair even better.

Currently, the preparatory work for the Fair is being actively carried out. Exhibits from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country are being continuously transported to Guangzhou. The relevant departments of the Fair have sent out invitations to businesspeople from all over the world, warmly welcoming them to come and visit and negotiate export and import trade.

    在国内外一派大好形势下
    今年秋季我国出口商品交易会正积极筹备
    新华社广州二十八日电　一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会，预定十月十五日到十一月十五日在广州举行。
    今年的秋季出口商品交易会，是在国内外一派大好形势下举办的。当前，世界人民的革命运动风起云涌，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派正面临着内外交困、焦头烂额的局面，日子很不好过。在我们伟大的社会主义祖国，亿万革命人民正以雄伟的步伐，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起斗、批、改的高潮，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的道路上阔步前进。我国工人阶级和广大贫下中农，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，推动着我国工农业生产的蓬勃发展。工业产品品种不断增加，产量持续上升。农业在连续六年丰收的基础上，今年夏收又获得丰收。工农业生产的发展，为今年的秋季出口商品交易会提供了更加丰富的物质基础。
    交易会以及有关部门的革命职工、革命干部，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，决心把这届交易会办得更好。
    目前，交易会的筹备工作正在积极进行。来自全国各省、市、自治区的展品正源源不断地运到广州。交易会的有关部门已向世界各地贸易界人士发出邀请信，热烈欢迎他们前来参观和洽谈出、进口贸易。
