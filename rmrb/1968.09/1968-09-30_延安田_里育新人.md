	On the frontline of the Yellow Sea, the soldiers of a certain communication station of the Navy have been diligently cultivating a "Yan'an Field." This is a plot of dry land covering only about thirty square meters, where the sweet potatoes are growing vigorously, with lush, glossy leaves.

	This is a place where fresh water is scarce. In the past, there was a folk song that described this place as: "The sea water rolls and flows, fresh water is as precious as oil, ten years without a harvest." Two years ago, a political instructor from a neighboring station visited Yan'an and brought back a bag of soil from the field where Chairman Mao once worked. They scattered this soil on the land and planted crops, naming it the "Yan'an Field." Since then, the soldiers have often carried water from far away to irrigate it, despite the hard work. The Party branch of the communication station also uses this "Yan'an Field" as a good classroom to promote the glorious traditions of the army and advance the ideological revolution of the troops. The first lesson for new recruits is to come to the "Yan'an Field," study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and talk about Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, encouraging the soldiers and officers to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take pride in hardship, make the island their home, and become good protectors of Chairman Mao's "thousand-mile eyes." The soldiers proudly say: "Thinking of Chairman Mao, our resolve remains unchanged even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble; looking at the 'Yan'an Field,' our revolutionary spirit is endless."

	Young Dong Ruiyun, who had just graduated from university, was assigned to be a livestock keeper after joining the army. He thought: "I studied medicine in school, why am I being asked to raise pigs? Raising pigs is dirty and tiring, how can I endure it?" When these selfish thoughts surfaced, he remembered the first lesson he had in the "Yan'an Field" about "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of farming in Yan'an. The more he thought about it, the more ashamed he felt, and the more he realized that his reluctance to raise pigs was wrong. From then on, he put aside his pride, humbly learned from the soldiers, and raised more than twenty pigs to be plump and healthy. On a windy and rainy night, a sow was about to give birth. Dong was worried that the sow might crush the piglets, so he alone, with a lantern in hand, braved the spring cold and squatted in the pigpen all night, ensuring that all the piglets were born safely.

	Chen Bujin, a model soldier who had been recognized every year since joining the army, came to the "Yan'an Field" for the last time to participate in labor before his demobilization. On the day of his departure, his comrades said to him: "We hope you will carry forward the glorious traditions of our army and become a red seed from the 'Yan'an Field,' sprouting wherever you are planted, blooming, and bearing fruit."

	After Chen Bujin returned home, he found that a small group of capitalist roaders and class enemies in the commune were spreading the "three selfs and one contract" wind, attempting to sabotage collective production. Chen Bujin decided to mobilize the masses to resist this evil trend. He carried the Little Red Book, visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with them, carried out revolutionary criticism, recalled bitterness and sweetness, and used living facts to denounce the heinous crimes of the "three selfs and one contract" spread by Liu Shaoqi. He enthusiastically spoke about the superiority of the people's commune. With Chen Bujin's help, many commune members opened their eyes, their awareness of the two-line struggle rapidly increased, and they resolutely took the road of collectivization, creating a new situation of seizing revolution and promoting production.

	Although this "Yan'an Field" is small, it shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. From here, a batch of revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao have been nurtured.

    “延安田”里育新人
    在祖国的黄海前哨，海军某部观通站的战士们，辛勤耕种着一块“延安田”。这是一块面积只有三十多平方米的旱地，地里的红薯长势非常旺盛，肥大的枝叶发出乌油油的光。
    这里是淡水奇缺的地方，过去曾有这样几句民谣，形容这个地方是：“海水滚滚流，淡水贵如油，十年十不收。”两年前，兄弟站的一位指导员到延安参观，战士们托他从毛主席当年在延安种过的地上带回一包土，把它撒在地里，在这块地里种上了庄稼，并且给它命名叫“延安田”。从此，战士们经常不怕劳累，从很远的地方挑来淡水浇灌它。观通站党支部还把这块“延安田”当作发扬我军光荣传统，促进部队思想革命化的好课堂。新战士入伍的第一课，就是来到“延安田”里，学习《为人民服务》，大讲大颂毛主席的伟大革命实践，勉励指战员们努力活学活用毛主席著作，以苦为荣，以岛为家，当好保卫毛主席的“千里眼”。战士们自豪地说：“想着毛主席，海枯石烂志不移，看着‘延安田’，革命干劲用不完。”
    刚出大学门的青年董瑞云，到部队后，领导上叫他去当饲养员。他心想：我在学校里学的是医科，为什么让我养猪？养猪又脏又累，怎么受得了？当这种私心杂念一露头的时候，他就想起在“延安田”里上的《为人民服务》的第一课，想起了毛主席当年在延安种地的伟大革命实践，越想越惭愧，越想越觉得自己不愿养猪的思想不对。从此，他放下架子，虚心向战士们学习，把二十多头猪喂得膘肥体壮。在一个风雨交加的夜晚，一只母猪要下崽了，小董担心母猪把小猪压坏，独自提着手灯，冒着春寒，整整在猪圈里蹲了一夜，使小猪都成活了。
    入伍后年年红的五好战士陈步进要复员时，特地跑到“延安田”里参加最后一次劳动。临走那天，战友们对他说：“希望你发扬我军光荣传统，作一颗‘延安田’里的红色种子，撒在那里，就在那里生根、开花、结果。”
    陈步进复员到家后，正值公社一小撮走资派和阶级敌人刮起“三自一包”的妖风，阴谋破坏集体生产。陈步进决心发动群众，打退阶级敌人掀起的这股歪风。于是，他怀揣宝书，挨户到贫下中农家里访问，和他们一起开展革命大批判，一起忆苦思甜，一起用活生生的事实控诉中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“三自一包”的滔天罪行，大讲大摆人民公社的优越性。在陈步进的帮助下，许多社员擦亮了眼睛，两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，坚决走集体化道路，出现了一个抓革命促生产的新局面。
    这块“延安田”虽然不大，却闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。从这里，培育了一批批无限忠于毛主席的革命战士。
