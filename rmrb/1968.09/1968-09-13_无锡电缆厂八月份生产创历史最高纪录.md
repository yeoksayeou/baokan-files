Workers at the Wuxi Cable Factory in Jiangsu, with the spirit of masters of the enterprise, bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. After the factory dispatched a portion of its workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, the remaining revolutionary workers in the factory seized the revolution and vigorously promoted production. In August, the factory's output value, production volume, and quality all surpassed the highest levels since the factory's establishment, achieving outstanding results.

This year, the state assigned the factory a production task that was 30% higher than the previous highest record. Despite having fewer personnel and heavy revolutionary and production tasks, the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." Armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they fiercely criticized the revisionist line of management and technological line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the factory. They broke through numerous outdated rules and regulations that had previously shackled the workers, powerfully driving the development of production.

The revolutionary workers who remained in the factory carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to revolutionize. The workers in the first workshop discarded the outdated production techniques formulated by a few technicians that were detached from reality. Relying entirely on their own wisdom and strength, they overcame a technical difficulty that had plagued the factory for a decade, reducing a process that previously required two steps to just one. This doubled the production efficiency and saved labor.

To comprehensively complete the factory's production tasks, the workers in various workshops united more closely, helping, supporting, and cooperating with each other. When a large extruder in the fourth workshop had a broken shaft, it would have taken three days to repair according to the old methods. This time, with the support of workers from the fourth and fifth workshops, the repair was completed in just one and a half days, allowing the machine to resume production.

    无锡电缆厂八月份生产创历史最高纪录
    江苏无锡电缆厂的工人，以主人翁的态度勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。全厂抽出了一部分工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队以后，留厂的革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，八月份产值、产量、质量都突破了建厂以来最高水平，创造了优异的成绩。
    今年国家交给这个厂的生产任务比历史上最高纪录还要提高百分之三十。在人员少，革命、生产任务重的情况下，工人们反复学习了毛主席的教导：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”。他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的赤胆忠心，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人所推行的修正主义办厂路线和科技路线，冲破了过去束缚工人手脚的许多条条、框框，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    留厂的革命工人发扬了敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神，大胆革新。一车间的拉线工人，丢掉过去由少数技术人员制定的脱离实际的生产工艺，完全依靠自己的智慧和力量，攻克了建厂十年来一直不能解决的技术难题，使原来需要经过两道工序完成的工作，只要一道工序就能完成，生产效率提高了一倍，同时节省了劳动力。
    为了全面地完成全厂生产任务，各车间的工人更加紧密地团结起来，互相帮助，互相支援，互相协作。四车间一台大挤塑机的轴断了，按过去的办法要等三天才能修好，这回四车间和五车间工人相互支援，只用一天半时间就修好投入生产。　（据新华社讯）
