Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in the capital's colleges and universities are actively promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely executing Chairman Mao's stipulated proletarian policies, and persistently using Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate revolutionary teachers and students.

Since the workers' propaganda teams entered the schools, they have united and guided revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, effectively promoting the victory of revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools. Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students are greatly inspired and joyfully say: The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams are good teachers for our re-education! The leading class has arrived, and the schools have taken on a new look. They express their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and humbly learn from the working class.

New China News Agency, September 14th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams from the capital have entered the capital's colleges and universities. They persistently use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate revolutionary teachers and students, resolutely execute Chairman Mao's stipulated proletarian policies regarding intellectuals, unite and guide revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the colleges and universities.

Since July 27th, when the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entered Tsinghua University, by the end of August, all 59 colleges and universities in the capital had been entered by the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. These team members are outstanding industrial workers selected from factories that have achieved revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations and have effectively carried out class cleansing. After entering the schools, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they have carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, persistently promoted and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, used Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, effectively promoted the victory of revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, and brought about a lively revolutionary new look in each school. Revolutionary teachers and students joyfully say: The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams are good teachers for our re-education! The leading class has arrived, and the schools have taken on a new look.

To fully exert the political leadership of the working class, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entering various colleges and universities have placed the promotion and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in the foremost important position. Under the guidance of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, colleges and universities have universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the level of classes, teaching and research groups, and departments. Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions, take class struggle as the key link, take the working class as an example, severely criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" as well as individualism, sectarianism, and mountainism, severely criticize the reactionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, rapidly raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, unite to fight the enemy, and quickly bring about a new look in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must fully pay attention and never be careless." During the process of re-educating revolutionary teachers and students, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entering various schools have particularly paid attention to studying, promoting, and implementing the series of proletarian policies proposed by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The important editorial note in the September 5th issue of the *Red Flag* magazine conveyed Chairman Mao's voice. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in various schools immediately organized serious study and implemented it. Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Students trained in old schools are mostly or largely able to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas," and the publication of the editorial article "On the Issue of Re-educating Intellectuals" by the editorial department of *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine have further armed the team members in their minds. Many schools' workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have, during the process of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, compared their work with Chairman Mao's stipulated proletarian policies, seriously summarized their work, and formulated new implementation measures.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entering various schools deeply understand that Chairman Mao's proletarian policies are powerful weapons for mobilizing the active factors of revolutionary teachers and students. Only by seriously implementing these policies can they truly unite the majority among them, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, and promote revolutionary intellectuals to quickly take the road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, after entering the schools, they have paid great attention to supporting the revolutionary initiatives of teachers and students, universally eating, living, working, and studying with revolutionary Red Guards, and jointly carrying out revolutionary great criticism. Many veteran workers from the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entering Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and other schools have also formed "one red pair" or "one red string" (workers, PLA, and revolutionary Red Guards) with revolutionary Red Guards. The slanders spread by a handful of class enemies attempting to create opposition between the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and revolutionary Red Guards have been met with a head-on counterattack. The broad masses of workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team members have pointed out that revolutionary Red Guards have unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In the early and middle stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieved great merits. Their merits must not be denied. For the few individuals who made this or that mistake, we must enthusiastically and patiently help and educate them, encouraging them to quickly correct their mistakes. Some schools' workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have also helped revolutionary Red Guards summarize their experiences and lessons since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, guiding them to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Tsinghua University has helped revolutionary Red Guards universally carry out the "three remembrances, three comparisons, and three examinations" activities, remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing the sweetness of the new society to examine one's class stance; remembering the persecution of the reactionary bourgeois line and comparing the brilliance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to examine one's performance in the struggle between the two lines; remembering the cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao and comparing one's loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao to examine whether one has always followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. These activities have given revolutionary young comrades a vivid and profound education in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, further igniting their class feelings of unlimited love for Chairman Mao.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in the capital have used Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, greatly inspiring them. They have expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and humbly learn from the working class. Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing Institute of Building Materials Industry, University of Science and Technology of China, and other schools have all carried out activities to learn from the working class. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals were issued, they further inspired the revolutionary teachers and students' enthusiasm to learn from the working class. They have expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the working class, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, resolutely take the road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

    坚决执行毛主席规定的各项无产阶级政策  坚持以毛泽东思想对革命师生进行再教育
    工人宣传队进驻学校后，团结和引导革命师生员工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，有力地推动了学校的革命大联合、革命三结合和斗、批、改的胜利发展。广大革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生受到极大鼓舞，十分高兴地说：工人毛泽东思想宣传队是对我们进行再教育的好老师！领导阶级一来，学校就出现了新气象。他们表示，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，虚心向工人阶级学习。
    新华社十四日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下进驻首都大专院校的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，坚持以毛泽东思想对广大革命师生进行再教育，坚决执行毛主席规定的对待知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，团结和引导革命师生员工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，促进了各大专院校的斗、批、改。
    从七月二十七日首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进清华大学以来，到八月底，首都五十九所大专院校已经全部进驻了工人毛泽东思想宣传队。这些工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员，都是从已经实现了革命的大联合和革命三结合，清理阶级队伍工作很有成效的工厂里抽调出来的优秀产业工人。他们进驻学校以后，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，坚持宣传、落实毛主席一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想对广大革命红卫兵小将和革命师生进行再教育，有力地推动了学校的革命大联合、革命三结合和斗、批、改的胜利发展，使各个院校出现一派生气勃勃的革命新气象。革命师生十分高兴地说：工人毛泽东思想宣传队是对我们进行再教育的好老师！领导阶级一来，学校就出现了新气象。
    为了充分发挥工人阶级的政治领导作用，进驻各大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，都把宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，摆在头等重要的地位。各大专院校在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，普遍以班级、教研组、科室为单位办起了毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命红卫兵小将和革命师生员工在毛泽东思想学习班里，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，以阶级斗争为纲，以工人阶级为榜样，狠批反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”以及个人主义、宗派主义、山头主义等错误倾向，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，人们团结起来，共同对敌，学校的斗、批、改很快出现了新的面貌。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”进驻各院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队对广大革命师生进行再教育的过程中，特别注意学习、宣传、落实以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部提出的一系列无产阶级政策。九月五日报上发表的《红旗》杂志重要编者按，传达了毛主席的声音，各院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，立即认真组织学习，并贯彻执行。毛主席的最新指示“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志评论员文章《关于知识分子再教育问题》的发表，又进一步从思想上武装了宣传队队员们。许多学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队在学习毛主席的最新指示的过程中，都对照毛主席规定的各项无产阶级政策，认真地总结自己的工作，制订新的落实措施。
    进驻各院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队深深懂得：毛主席提出的各项无产阶级政策，是调动广大革命师生积极因素的有力武器。只有认真贯彻执行这些政策，才能真正团结起他们之中的大多数，搞好学校的斗、批、改，推动广大革命的知识分子迅速走上与工农兵相结合的道路。因此，他们在进校以后，都十分注意支持革命师生的革命倡议，普遍同革命的红卫兵小将同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，同搞革命大批判。进驻清华大学、北京大学、北京航空学院等院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的许多老工人，还和革命的红卫兵小将结成“一对红”或者“一串红”（工人、解放军、革命的红卫兵小将）。一小撮阶级敌人妄图制造工人毛泽东思想宣传队和革命红卫兵小将之间的对立而散布的流言蜚语，遭到了迎头痛击。广大工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员们指出，革命的红卫兵小将无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，在文化大革命运动初期和中期，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，立下了丰功伟绩。他们的功绩绝不能否定。少数个别小将犯了这样那样的错误，我们一定要热情、耐心地帮助、教育他们，鼓励他们迅速改正错误。一些院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助革命的红卫兵小将总结他们在无产阶级文化大革命以来的经验教训，引导他们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署前进。驻清华大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队帮助革命红卫兵小将普遍开展“三忆三比三查”的活动，忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，查自己的阶级立场；忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大，查自己在两条路线斗争中的表现；忆党和毛主席对自己的培养，比对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心，查自己是否始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。这些活动，使革命小将们受到了生动深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，进一步激发了他们无限热爱毛主席的阶级感情。
    首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队用毛泽东思想对广大革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生进行无产阶级的再教育，使革命师生们受到了极大的鼓舞，纷纷表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，虚心向工人阶级学习。北京建筑工业学院、中国科技大学等院校的革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生，都开展了向工人阶级学习的活动。毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示发表以后，进一步激励了革命师生向工人阶级学习的热情。他们表示，一定要在工人阶级的领导下，沿着毛主席指引的方向，坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路，搞好学校的斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
