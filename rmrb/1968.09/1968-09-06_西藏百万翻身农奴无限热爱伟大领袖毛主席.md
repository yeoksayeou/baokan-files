From the northern grasslands of Tibet to the foothills of the Himalayas, from the Ali Plateau to the banks of the Jinsha River, everywhere is a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad revolutionary masses are determined to forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in making revolution and turning Tibet into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 5th – After the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad Tibetan revolutionary masses love the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, even more deeply. With profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have launched a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, in Tibet, from the northern grasslands to the foothills of the Himalayas, from the Ali Plateau to the banks of the Jinsha River, everywhere is a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. On the vast plateau, every tent, every home, and many village entrances and roadside spots have hung up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and erected golden Mao Zedong Quotations boards. One million serfs, from the white-haired elderly to children in their teens, all eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. Young people teach the elderly, parents teach their children, husbands teach their wives, and this has become a common practice. The broad masses of serfs say: "Chairman Mao's books are the books of serf liberation, if we don't study them, who will?" They study at home, in night schools, and even in the fields. In villages, fields, and pastures, the sound of reciting Mao Zedong Quotations echoes everywhere, and songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao resonate everywhere. A 72-year-old blind old man named Losang, who was born a slave, every day leans on his cane and asks others to read "Mao Zedong Quotations" and the "Three Articles" to him. Now he can recite dozens of quotations and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," and he excitedly tells everyone: "Although I am blind and can see nothing, with Chairman Mao, I see the light, and it feels like everything in front of me is red. I want to live a few more years and work for the socialist revolution." Like Old Man Losang, the broad masses of serfs have thrown off the spiritual shackles of the three great lords' feudal superstitions that have bound them for thousands of years and picked up the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to attack the class enemy. Those who used to spin prayer wheels now hold "Mao Zedong Quotations." The prayer wheels on the roofs have been replaced by revolutionary slogans fluttering in the wind. Instead of greeting each other with "Tashi Delek" (good luck), they now wish each other "Long live Chairman Mao forever." An old man who was deeply poisoned by feudal superstitions said: "I chanted scriptures for half my life and prayed to Buddha for half my life, but I suffered for half my life. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings, I finally understood. From now on, I will wholeheartedly love Chairman Mao and believe in the great Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao in making revolution to the end."

"Oh, flying geese, please fly quickly! Take a message to Beijing: the liberated serfs miss Chairman Mao, our benefactor!" The one million serfs of Tibet, recalling the past and comparing it to the present, love the great leader Chairman Mao even more deeply. They say: "The mountains are not higher than the sky, the rivers are not deeper than the sea, Chairman Mao's kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea." In the past, the people of the Menba ethnic group, who lived in the Himalayas and deep mountains, suffered long-term cruel exploitation and oppression by the three great lords. Today, under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have leaped from a slave society into a socialist society and live a happy life. They say, we Menba ethnic slaves were able to achieve liberation, all thanks to Chairman Mao, our benefactor. Now, in the Menba villages, every household has a portrait of Chairman Mao, and in front of and behind the villages, there are golden Mao Zedong Quotations boards. Some families have couplets on their doors that read: "Deep roots and lush leaves, happiness comes from Chairman Mao; Drinking water, thinking of the source, liberation will never forget the Communist Party," expressing their profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao.

"The sun in the sky rises and sets; Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the liberated serfs, shining day and night." The one million serfs are endlessly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and everyone strives to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, using various methods to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "One person is red, a little red; everyone is red, a big red." The poor serf family of Zaxi Nima, with a sincere heart towards the great leader Chairman Mao, before dawn, wades through the icy river to the other side, making several trips to carry the wooden planks they prepared for repairing their house back to the village. In two days, they built a Mao Zedong Quotations shed at the village entrance for the villagers to study Chairman Mao's works. Zaxi Nima also suggested carving Mao Zedong Quotations on the most prominent rock wall on the mountain for passersby to study. His initiative was immediately supported by the liberated serfs in the village. They said: "We will act according to Chairman Mao's teachings of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people, carving Mao Zedong Quotations on the mountain, for as long as needed. Let Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts illuminate our generations to come." Under everyone's efforts, the mountain peaks and hills are filled with the highest directives, and travelers can see Chairman Mao's words, forever guiding them forward.

"Never before have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor." Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the political awareness of the broad Tibetan revolutionary masses is constantly improving. They closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and march forward bravely. Recently, Tibetan road workers at the Tanggula Mountain pass, together with the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Tanggula Mountain garrison, studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and important articles by Comrade Yao Wenyuan on the snowy mountains, and set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. They are determined to break ice and shovel snow at Tanggula Mountain for life, protect the road for life, and achieve: "Standing on Tanggula, thinking of Beijing, looking at the world from the top of the snow mountain!" The herdsmen on the grasslands fiercely criticized the "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," and the "no struggle, no division," "no class distinction" in pastoral areas and other revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, greatly improving their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness. The broad Tibetan revolutionary masses resolutely declare that they will closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, further strengthen military-civilian unity, build the national border into an iron wall, and turn Tibet into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    西藏百万翻身农奴无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    从藏北草原到喜马拉雅山麓，从阿里高原到金沙江畔，到处是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。广大革命人民决心永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席干革命，把西藏办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    新华社拉萨五日电　经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，西藏广大藏族革命人民更加无限热爱各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，他们怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动新高潮。
    今天，在西藏，从藏北草原到喜马拉雅山麓，从阿里高原到金沙江畔，到处是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。在万里高原上，每顶帐篷，每家住房和许多村口、路旁，都挂起了伟大领袖毛主席的画像，竖起了金光闪闪的毛主席语录牌。百万翻身农奴，从白发苍苍的老人，到十几岁的娃娃，人人都如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。青年人教老年人，父母教儿女，丈夫教妻子，已蔚然成风。广大翻身农奴说：“毛主席的书，是农奴翻身解放的书，我们不学谁学。”他们在家里学，在夜校里学，到地里也学。在村庄、田边、地头和牧场，到处响彻着朗读毛主席语录的声音，到处荡漾着歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的赞歌。奴隶出身的双目失明的七十二岁老人罗桑，每天扶着拐棍，请人给他读《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，现在他能背几十条语录和《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》，他逢人便激动地说：“我虽然眼瞎了，什么也看不见，但有了毛主席，我看见了光明，只觉得眼前一片红彤彤。我要多活几年，干社会主义革命。”象罗桑老人一样，广大翻身农奴丢掉了几千年来三大领主用封建迷信统治他们的精神枷锁，拿起了战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个武器，向阶级敌人进攻。过去手摇转经筒的人，现在手捧《毛主席语录》了。过去房顶上的风经，现在换成了随风飘扬的革命标语。过去人们见面用“扎喜德勒”（吉祥如意）问好，现在是共同“祝福毛主席万寿无疆”。一位过去受封建迷信毒害很深的老人说：“我念了半辈子经，求了半辈子佛，却受了半辈子的苦。在无产阶级文化大革命中，学习了毛主席的教导，我才明白过来。今后，我要一心热爱毛主席，一心信仰伟大的毛泽东思想，跟着毛主席革命到底。”
    “远飞的大雁啊，请你快快飞吧！捎个信儿到北京：翻身农奴想念恩人毛主席！”西藏百万翻身农奴，回忆过去，对比现在，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱。他们说：“山高高不过蓝天，河深深不过海洋，毛主席的恩情比天高，比海深。”过去长期遭受三大领主残酷剥削和压迫，住在喜马拉雅山丛山峻岭中的门巴族人民，今天，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，由奴隶社会一跃而进入社会主义社会，过上了幸福生活。他们说，我们这些门巴族奴隶能够得到翻身解放，全靠恩人毛主席。现在，门巴族所住的山村，家家户户有毛主席像，村前村后都有金光闪闪的毛主席语录牌。有的人家门上贴着“根深叶茂幸福来自毛主席；饮水思源翻身不忘共产党”的对联，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。
    “天上的太阳，上山又下山；毛主席是我们翻身农奴心中的红太阳，日日夜夜放光芒。”百万翻身农奴无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，人人都争当毛泽东思想宣传员，采取各种方式宣传毛泽东思想。他们说：“一人红，红一点；大家红，红一片。”贫苦农奴扎西尼玛一家人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席一颗赤诚的心，天不亮，就趟着刺骨的河水，到河的对面，往返数次，把自己准备修房用的木板搬回村里，用两天时间，在村头修了一座毛主席语录棚，供村里的人学习毛主席著作。扎西尼玛还建议在山上最显眼的石壁上，刻上毛主席语录，供来往行人学习。他的倡议立刻得到村里翻身农奴的赞同，大家说：“我们要按照毛主席教导的‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务办事，在山上刻毛主席语录，刻多久都行。让毛主席的光辉思想，照亮我们世世代代。”在大家的奋战下，山头山岗上刻满了最高指示，行人抬头就可以看到毛主席的话，永远指引着人们前进。
    “从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”西藏广大藏族革命人民在毛泽东思想哺育下，政治觉悟不断提高。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，奋勇前进。在唐古拉山山口工作的藏族道班工人，最近同唐古拉山兵站的毛泽东思想宣传队，一起学习了毛主席的最新指示和姚文元同志的重要文章，在雪山上摆开了革命大批判和斗私批修的战场。他们决心在唐古拉山破一辈子冰，挖一辈子雪，护一辈子路，做到：“身在唐古拉，心向北京城，站在雪山顶，放眼全世界！”草原上的牧民，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”以及牧区“不斗、不分”、“不划阶级”等修正主义谬论，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大藏族革命人民坚决表示，一定紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，进一步加强军民团结，把祖国边疆建设成铜墙铁壁，把西藏办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
