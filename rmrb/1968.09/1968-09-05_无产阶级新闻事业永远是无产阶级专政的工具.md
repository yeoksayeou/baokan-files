The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: during the period when class distinctions exist in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle.

The proletarian press is an important component of the proletarian revolutionary cause. According to Chairman Mao's proletarian press line, the proletarian press must serve the political line of the proletariat and must become a powerful weapon for proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

The Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, has, out of his counter-revolutionary needs, long opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian press line and has crazily promoted a counter-revolutionary bourgeois press line, attempting to turn the press into a tool for subverting proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism. The so-called "publicly-run" theory, "serve the readers" theory, and "universal interest" theory are three poisoned arrows shot by the Chinese Khrushchev against Chairman Mao's proletarian press line and in promotion of the bourgeois press line. These counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev must be thoroughly criticized.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the so-called "publicly-run" theory, which is to oppose the proletariat seizing the press battlefield.

Chairman Mao teaches us: before the elimination of classes, newspapers, periodicals, radio, and news agencies all have class characteristics and serve a certain class. The proletarian press serves the proletariat and therefore must be firmly in the hands of the proletariat and run by the proletariat and the proletarian party.

The Chinese Khrushchev stubbornly stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, openly opposing the proletarian press being led by the proletariat, and vigorously advocates the so-called "publicly-run" theory. He shouts that Xinhua News Agency should be "publicly-run," "should not emphasize official status too much," and "should not be tied down too tightly."

Is there really such a thing as a "publicly-run" press that is not led by a certain class or party in the world? There never has been and never will be. There is no newspaper in the world without its own political stance, no newspaper that does not represent a certain class or political group, using its news and opinions to directly or indirectly influence readers, making them accept its political propositions, support what it supports, and oppose what it opposes. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, in order to cover up the reactionary essence of bourgeois dictatorship, often keeps a group of "idle literati" to run a few so-called "publicly-run" newspapers and periodicals. On the surface, it seems that "those in power criticize those out of power, and those out of power criticize those in power," as if there really is a "publicly-run" press. In fact, this is sheer deception. Such a "publicly-run" press is also class-based and serves the bourgeoisie. Sometimes they criticize the bourgeoisie a bit, but as Lu Xun once sharply pointed out: their criticism is like Jia Da's criticism, not to overthrow the Jia family, but to make the Jia family better. The facts clearly show that the Chinese Khrushchev's vigorous advocacy of the "publicly-run" press is a conspiracy, a thorough and through counter-revolutionary revisionist black commodity.

Why does the Chinese Khrushchev so fervently advocate the so-called "publicly-run" press and oppose the proletariat's leadership of the press? This must be linked to the historical background of that time. It was 1956, when Khrushchev was vigorously opposing Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, promoting "liberalization" and restoring capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev, who had infiltrated the Party, misjudged the situation, took to the field bare-chested, actively collaborated with the Soviet Khrushchev's anti-communist current, and stirred up a black wind of bourgeois "liberalization" in opposition to communism, the people, and socialism at home. The so-called "publicly-run" press was a part of this counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the so-called "serve the readers" theory, which is to oppose the press serving proletarian politics.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that as ideological forms, literature, art, academia, the press, and so on, must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve proletarian politics, and serve the socialist economic base. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Chairman Mao's instructions profoundly reveal the clear class nature and party nature of proletarian newspapers.

The Chinese Khrushchev openly opposes Chairman Mao's great instructions and sings the opposite tune. He picks up the "serve the readers" theory from the bourgeois press barons' garbage heap and shouts to the press workers: "You serve the readers, you serve the people who read the newspaper. If the readers say it's good, then your work is done well." Here, the Chinese Khrushchev completely removes the class nature and party nature of the proletarian press, changing the proletarian press serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, and serving the socialist economic base, into the bourgeois "serve the readers."

"Readers" are divided by class, and the press of different classes must serve readers of different classes. There is no such thing as a super-class "reader," and there is no press that serves "readers" of all classes. The service object of the proletarian press is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Without the class nature of the "readers," abstractly talking about "serving the readers" is to push the revisionist "all-people" policy in the press, which actually means making the proletarian press serve the bourgeoisie.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, class struggle is concentrated on the issue of power. It is whether the proletariat will consolidate proletarian dictatorship or the bourgeoisie will overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the so-called "serve the readers" theory, whose evil purpose is to make people forget about power, forget about proletarian dictatorship, so as to achieve his evil purpose of usurping the Party and the state and restoring capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the so-called "universal interest" theory, which is to oppose the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us that the proletarian newspaper must "strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely run the newspaper according to Chairman Mao's newspaper-running thoughts."

The most fundamental task of the proletarian press is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We must strive to turn the newspaper into a large school for learning, spreading, and popularizing Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all aspects of news reporting, quickly and accurately convey Chairman Mao's voice, and combine Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, turning it into conscious action and an endless force to change the world.

The Chinese Khrushchev, out of his counter-revolutionary nature, crazily opposes the proletarian press propagating Mao Zedong Thought. One of his vicious methods is to vigorously advocate the bourgeois "universal interest" theory. He shouts at the top of his voice: "There must be universal interest... The bourgeois news agencies can make it interesting, why can't we make it even more interesting?" The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements like Lu Dingyi, following the instructions of their masters, also shout loudly: "To cultivate the interests of the masses according to their objective interests is our noble responsibility," and so on. Under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the press use a large amount of newspaper space and the main programs of radio to propagate the bourgeois "knowledgeability" and "interest" black commodities, launching a fierce attack on the proletariat without guns or cannons.

Our proletarian newspapers are tools serving proletarian politics and cannot engage in bourgeois "knowledgeability" and "interest." Chairman Mao taught us as early as 1925: "Why publish a political weekly? For the revolution." Vice Chairman Lin also instructs us: "The newspaper is an invisible guide, an invisible commander, like a correspondence school that sends teaching materials every day, a quick, good, and economical method." Our proletarian newspapers are "for the revolution," are the "guide" and "commander" of the masses, and are a "correspondence school." It must use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to guide the masses, educate the masses, and help the masses see the direction in struggle, correctly recognize and solve various problems, and create a bright red new world.

We proletarian press warriors must rise up with the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois press line, thoroughly purge all the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison he spread, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on our press battlefield!

    无产阶级新闻事业永远是无产阶级专政的工具
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义新闻路线
    空新
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：在世界上存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸总是阶级斗争的工具。
    无产阶级新闻事业，是无产阶级革命事业的重要组成部分。按照毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线，无产阶级新闻事业必须为无产阶级的政治路线服务，必须成为无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的有力武器。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，出于他的反革命需要，长期以来，一贯仇视和反对毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线，疯狂推行反革命的资产阶级新闻路线，妄图使新闻事业变成颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。所谓“民办”论、“为读者服务”论、“普遍兴趣”论，就是中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席的无产阶级新闻路线、推行资产阶级新闻路线而放射出来的三支毒箭。对中国赫鲁晓夫的这些反革命修正主义谬论，必须彻底批判。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹所谓“民办”论，就是反对无产阶级占领新闻阵地
    毛主席教导我们：在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。无产阶级的新闻事业，是为无产阶级服务的，因此，必须牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里，必须由无产阶级来办，由无产阶级的政党来办。
    中国赫鲁晓夫顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场，公然反对无产阶级的新闻事业必须由无产阶级来掌握领导权，大肆鼓吹所谓“民办”论。他叫嚷什么新华社应该“民办”，“不要老是强调官方身份，更不要把自己束缚得死死的”。
    世界上难道果真有什么不受一定阶级、一定政党领导的所谓“民办”新闻事业吗？从来没有，也永远不会有。世界上没有一家报纸没有自己的政治立场，没有一家报纸不代表一定阶级或政治集团，用自己的消息和言论，去直接或间接影响读者，让读者接受它的政治主张，拥护它所拥护的，反对它所反对的。在资本主义社会里，资产阶级为了掩盖资产阶级专政的反动实质，常常豢养一批“帮闲文人”，办几家所谓“民办”报刊。从表面上看来，“在朝的骂在野的，在野的骂在朝的”，似乎真有“民办”新闻事业。其实，这是十足的欺骗。这种所谓的“民办”新闻事业，同样是有阶级性的，是为资产阶级服务的。它们有时对资产阶级也骂上几句，但正如鲁迅曾经尖锐指出过的：他们这种“骂”，正象“焦大的骂，并非要打倒贾府，倒是要贾府好”。事实清楚地说明，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹什么“民办”新闻事业，完全是阴谋，是彻头彻尾、彻里彻外的反革命修正主义黑货。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为什么如此狂热地鼓吹所谓“民办”新闻事业，反对无产阶级对新闻事业的领导呢？这就要联系到当时的历史背景来看。那是一九五六年，正是赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十次代表大会上大反斯大林，大搞“自由化”，大搞资本主义复辟的时候。混进党内的中国赫鲁晓夫，错误地估计了形势，赤膊上阵，积极配合苏联赫鲁晓夫的反共逆流，在国内刮起了一股资产阶级“自由化”的反共反人民反社会主义的黑风。所谓“民办”新闻事业，就是这个反革命阴谋的一个组成部分。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹所谓“为读者服务”论，就是反对新闻事业为无产阶级政治服务
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，作为观念形态的文学、艺术、学术、新闻等等事业，要为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义经济基础服务。毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”毛主席的指示，深刻地揭示了无产阶级报刊鲜明的阶级性和党性。
    中国赫鲁晓夫公然同毛主席的伟大指示大唱反调，他从资产阶级报阀的垃圾堆里，拾起了“为读者服务”论的破烂，对新闻工作者大叫大嚷什么：“你们是为读者服务的，为看报的人服务的。看报的人说好，你们的工作就是作好了。”在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫完全抽掉了无产阶级新闻事业的阶级性和党性，把无产阶级新闻事业要为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义经济基础服务，篡改成资产阶级的“为读者服务”。
    “读者”是划分为阶级的，不同阶级的新闻事业，必然为不同阶级的读者服务。绝没有什么超阶级的“读者”，也绝没有同时为所有阶级的“读者”服务的新闻事业。无产阶级新闻事业的服务对象，是广大的工农兵。离开了“读者”的阶级性，抽象地去谈什么“为读者服务”，就是在新闻事业中推销修正主义的“全民”方针，实际上也就是要无产阶级新闻事业为资产阶级服务。
    无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，是政权问题。就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹所谓“为读者服务”论，其罪恶目的，就是妄图让人们忘记政权，忘记无产阶级专政，以便实现他篡党篡政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹所谓“普遍兴趣”论，就是反对宣传毛泽东思想
    林副主席指示我们，无产阶级的报纸必须“努力宣传毛泽东思想，坚决按毛主席办报思想办报”。
    无产阶级新闻事业的最根本的任务，就是宣传毛泽东思想。要努力把报纸办成一个学习、传播和普及毛泽东思想的大学校，要用毛泽东思想统帅新闻报道的一切方面，最迅速、最准确地传达毛主席的声音，使毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众结合起来，成为自觉的行动，变为改造世界的无穷无尽的力量。
    中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的反革命本性，疯狂反对无产阶级新闻事业宣传毛泽东思想。他的一个恶毒的手法就是大肆鼓吹资产阶级的“普遍兴趣”论。他声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么：“要有普遍兴趣，……资产阶级通讯社能搞得有兴趣，难道我们就不能搞得更有兴趣吗？”反革命修正主义分子陆定一之流秉承他们的主子的意旨，也大肆叫嚷“按照群众的客观利益来培养群众的兴趣是我们高尚的责任”，等等。在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，新闻界一小撮反革命修正主义分子把报纸的大量版面，广播的主要节目，用来宣传资产阶级的“知识性”、“趣味性”的黑货，向无产阶级进行了一场没有枪声、没有炮声的猖狂进攻。
    我们无产阶级的报纸是为无产阶级政治服务的工具，绝不能搞什么资产阶级的“知识性”、“趣味性”。毛主席早在一九二五年就教导我们：“为什么出版政治周报？为了革命。”林副主席也指示我们：“报纸是不见面的指导员，不见面的司令员，等于函授学校，每天发教材，是多快好省的办法。”我们无产阶级的报纸，是“为了革命”，是人民群众的“指导员”，“司令员”，是“函授学校”。它必须以毛泽东思想为指针，去指导群众，教育群众，帮助群众在斗争中看清方向，正确认识和解决各种问题，创造出一个红彤彤的新世界。
    我们无产阶级的新闻战士，一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级新闻路线，彻底肃清他散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在我们的新闻阵地高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
