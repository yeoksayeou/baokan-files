The workers, technicians, and revolutionary cadres at Longyan Iron Mine have achieved remarkable results through the three-in-one combination. China's first black metal heavy-media beneficiation plant has been completed.

This plant, after trial production, has shown excellent results. The beneficiation quality has surpassed the national standards and smelting requirements, filling a gap in China's heavy-media beneficiation technology.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 10th, the workers of Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province have fully demonstrated the leading role of the working class. Together with engineering technicians and revolutionary cadres, they have implemented the three-in-one combination. They have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, carried forward the daring and innovative spirit of the proletarian revolution, and built China's first black metal heavy-media beneficiation plant through self-reliance. The plant, after trial production, has shown excellent beneficiation results, and the beneficiation quality has surpassed the national standards and smelting requirements. The successful construction of this plant has filled a gap in China's heavy-media beneficiation technology, creating favorable conditions for fully utilizing China's underground resources and promoting the development of the steel industry.

Longyan Iron Mine is one of the major steel raw material bases in North China. A large amount of its ore has low iron content and cannot be directly smelted in furnaces. In the past, many bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" conducted extensive research and experiments for more than a decade but found no solution. Other similar mines across the country also hoped that Longyan Iron Mine could create an effective method for processing low-grade iron ore.

In May 1966, the state planned to build the first black metal heavy-media beneficiation plant at Longyan Iron Mine. From the beginning of the construction, revolutionary workers, revolutionary engineering technicians, and revolutionary cadres formed a three-in-one construction team with workers as the main body. However, due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, the initial three-in-one combination was only organizational, not truly united in thought. At that time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party also used their temporarily usurped power to vigorously advocate for "technical leadership" and "expert management," deliberately creating ideological divisions.

In January of this year, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres of this mine seized power from the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and established a revolutionary committee. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad masses of revolutionary workers united with the technicians to launch a revolutionary criticism and criticism campaign, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist management line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and raising everyone's awareness. The chairman, standing committee members, and engineering technicians of the revolutionary committee studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander, the soul, "believing in and relying on the masses," and "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." They moved their bedding into the workers' dormitories, rolled around with the workers, and humbly learned from the workers, not only learning the workers' practical experience but more importantly, learning the noble qualities of the working class. Technician Liu Shaoxian, after living and working with the workers, deeply felt, "In the past, I also learned from the workers, but mainly on the construction site, learning the workers' practical experience, not paying attention to learning the workers' stance and feelings, only learning technical skills, not transforming thoughts, having good technology, but not being able to serve the proletariat."

With Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, the three-in-one construction team with revolutionary workers as the main body fully unleashed the positive factors of the people, continuously breaking through technical and material equipment bottlenecks. For example, the key equipment in the ore separation process, the vibrating chute, had its design repeatedly failing to meet quality requirements in the past. Engineering technicians and workers worked together, conducted experiments together, learned the practical experience of the working class, especially the noble qualities of the working class to build socialism quickly, economically, and efficiently. They realized that they had the idea of experimenting for the sake of experimenting, detached from production reality. They adjusted the volume of the chute according to the workers' suggestions and actual needs, changed the type of water used, and quickly solved the quality problem of the vibrating chute, achieving excellent beneficiation quality.

The construction of this plant had no modern equipment and no ready-made materials. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and bourgeois technical authorities sneered and mocked. Under the organization and leadership of the revolutionary committee, workers, engineering technicians, and revolutionary cadres repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift and self-reliance, fiercely criticized the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and fiercely criticized the crimes of pursuing grandeur and foreign goods, embezzlement, and waste by the capitalist roaders within the unit. Everyone unified their thoughts and unanimously expressed their determination to follow the self-reliant, thrifty path indicated by Chairman Mao, building the factory with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, the beneficiation plant was quickly completed. Many engineering technicians deeply felt, "By combining with the workers, not only was China's first black metal heavy-media beneficiation plant built, but also significant improvement and elevation in thought were achieved. As long as there is leadership from the working class, engineering technicians, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers combine on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles unimaginable to the bourgeoisie."

    龙烟铁矿工人和技术人员、革命干部实行三结合取得丰硕成果
    我国第一座黑色金属重介质选矿厂建成
    这座厂经过试生产，效果良好，选矿质量超过了国家规定指标和冶炼要求，填补了我国重介质选矿的一项空白。
    据新华社石家庄十日电　河北省龙烟铁矿广大工人充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，和工程技术人员、革命领导干部实行三结合，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，发扬敢想敢干的无产阶级革命精神，自力更生地建成我国第一座黑色金属重介质选矿厂。选矿厂经过试生产，选矿效果良好，选矿质量超过了国家规定指标和冶炼要求。这座厂建设成功，填补了我国重介质选矿的一项空白，为充分利用我国地下资源，促进钢铁工业的发展，创造了有利条件。
    龙烟铁矿是华北地区大型钢铁原料基地之一。这个矿的大量矿石由于含铁量低，不能直接入炉冶炼。过去许多资产阶级“专家”、“权威”左研究，右实验，折腾了十几年，没有一点办法。全国同类型的兄弟矿山也希望龙烟铁矿能创造一种处理低含量铁矿石的有效方法。
    一九六六年五月份，国家准备在龙烟铁矿创建第一座黑色金属重介质选矿厂。建厂一开始，革命工人、革命工程技术人员和革命领导干部，组成了一支以革命工人为主体的三结合建设队伍。但是，由于受中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的影响，开始的三结合仅仅是组织上的结合，思想上没有真正结合。这时党内一小撮走资派也利用暂时窃踞的职权，拚命鼓吹“技术挂帅”、“专家治厂”，有意制造思想上的分裂。
    今年一月，这个矿的无产阶级革命派、革命职工、革命领导干部夺了党内一小撮走资派窃踞的权力，建立了革命委员会。广大革命工人在革委会领导下，团结技术人员，开展了革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办厂路线，提高了大家的认识。革委会主任、常委和工程技术人员又学习了毛主席的政治是统帅，是灵魂、“要相信和依靠群众”、“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”等伟大教导，把铺盖搬进工人宿舍，和工人滚在一起，虚心向工人学习，不仅学习工人的实践经验，更重要的是学习工人阶级的高贵品质。技术员刘少先和工人一起生活、一起劳动以后深有感触地说：“过去也向工人学习，但主要是在工地上学习工人的实践经验，不注意学习工人的立场和思想感情，单学技术业务，不改造思想，有了好的技术，也不能为无产阶级服务。”
    以革命工人为主体的三结合建设队伍，有了毛泽东思想作统帅，人的积极因素就充分发挥出来，不断地突破技术和材料设备上的难关。如矿石分选过程的关键设备震动溜槽，过去的设计总不合乎质量要求。工程技术人员和工人一起劳动，一起试验，学到了工人阶级的实践经验，特别是学到了工人阶级多、快、好、省建设社会主义的高贵品质，认识到自己有为试验而试验的思想，脱离生产实际。他们按照工人的建议和实际需要，调整了溜槽体积，变换了水种，很快解决了震动溜槽的质量问题，选矿质量很好。
    建设这个厂，一无现代化设备，二无现成材料，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术权威又冷嘲热讽。工人、工程技术人员和革命领导干部在革委会的组织领导下，反复学习了毛主席的勤俭办企业和自力更生的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，狠批本单位走资派贪大求洋、贪污浪费的罪行。大家统一了思想，一致表示坚决要走毛主席指引的自力更生、勤俭建国的道路，靠毛泽东思想来建厂。这样，选矿厂很快就建成了。许多工程技术人员深有感触地说：“和工人结合在一起，不仅建成了我国第一座黑色金属重介质选矿厂，而且在思想上得到很大的锻炼和提高。只要有工人阶级领导，工程技术人员、革命干部和革命工人在毛泽东思想基础上结合起来，就能创造出资产阶级所不可想象的奇迹。”
