This year, the liberated serfs of the Anti-Imperialist People's Commune have, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, earnestly studied and implemented Chairman Mao's important instructions from his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China a year ago. We have advanced along the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as indicated by Chairman Mao, achieving victories in both revolution and production. Now, we are striving to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The liberated serfs of our commune and the million liberated serfs of all Tibet fervently wish our great red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Over the past year, we have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, combined them with the actual class struggle in our commune, and continuously carried out the revolutionary criticism. We have criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, especially the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and the theory of "extinguishing class struggle." At the criticism meetings, many old fathers and mothers, with their personal experiences in the old society, wept bitterly as they denounced the cruel exploitation and oppression of the serf owners against us serfs. This powerfully refuted the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary theory of attempting to restore the feudal serf system and capitalism. We also compiled and performed many programs based on the evil deeds of the serf owners and their agents exploiting and oppressing us serfs in the old society, conducting extensive class education. After watching, many liberated serfs were moved to say that if we do not completely criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet, once their plot to restore capitalism succeeds, we will suffer twice. We resolutely follow the great leader Chairman Mao on the socialist road. Whoever tries to restore the feudal serf system and capitalism, we will fight to the end with them!

The persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Running study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." With the help of the People's Liberation Army, our commune has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the commune level, and each production team has also set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Last year, the liberated serfs of our commune split into two opposing factions. In the study classes, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two opposing factions." Everyone said, we liberated serfs were all oppressed and exploited by the serf owners in the old society, and it was Chairman Mao who liberated us from the sea of suffering. What fundamental conflicts of interest do we have? Our split into two opposing factions was caused by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. The liberated serfs resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, through criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness, conducting self-criticism, and quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination throughout the commune. August 30th is a great day for the liberated serfs of the Anti-Imperialist People's Commune. On this day, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our commune's revolutionary committee was born in victory.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production," we also achieved a great victory in production this year, harvesting the largest yield in history. We overcame numerous difficulties, reclaimed more than three hundred ke (one ke equals one mu) of wasteland, cut through mountains to build irrigation canals, and on land that had not been farmed for a thousand years, we harvested a bountiful crop of highland barley and rapeseed.

Through more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have further realized that to follow Chairman Mao closely, we must, with profound proletarian feelings, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. In our Anti-Imperialist People's Commune, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, everyone wears a Chairman Mao badge, and everyone can sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Wherever the liberated serfs go, they bring the Little Red Book with them. Studying Chairman Mao's works has become the first need in the life of every liberated serf. Fields, farmlands, and homes have all become battlefields for us to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and criticize and repudiate revisionism and selfishness.

Now, the great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation." The revolutionary committee of the Anti-Imperialist People's Commune is determined to further mobilize the masses, rally all positive factors, lead the liberated serfs of the commune to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, extensively set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further extensively and deeply carry out the mass movement of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, quickly launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Anti-Imperialist People's Commune through to the end! Turn the Anti-Imperialist People's Commune into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    翻身农奴决心搞好斗批改
    西藏自治区反帝人民公社革委会主任  次仁旺堆
    在这光辉灿烂的一年中，我们反帝人民公社的翻身农奴，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，认真学习和落实毛主席一年前视察华北、中南和华东地区时的重要指示，沿着毛主席指引的无产阶级文化大革命的航向前进，取得了革命、生产双胜利。现在，我们正在为全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而斗争。我们公社翻身农奴和全西藏百万翻身农奴，衷心敬祝我们各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    一年来，我们遵照毛主席的教导，结合我们公社的阶级斗争实际，持续地开展了革命大批判。批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏代理人的反革命修正主义路线，特别是批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”和“阶级斗争熄灭”论的反革命修正主义黑货。在批判大会上，许多老阿爸、老阿妈以自己在旧社会的亲身经历，痛哭流涕地控诉了农奴主对我们农奴的残酷剥削和压迫，有力地驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟封建农奴制度和资本主义的反动理论。我们还根据在旧社会里农奴主和农奴主代理人剥削压迫我们农奴的罪恶事实，自编自演了许多节目，广泛进行阶级教育。广大翻身农奴看后，许多人激动地说，如果不把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏代理人的反革命修正主义黑货批倒批臭，一旦他们复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，我们就要吃二遍苦。我们坚决跟伟大领袖毛主席走社会主义道路，谁要复辟封建农奴制度和资本主义，我们就和谁拚到底！
    持久深入开展革命大批判，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”在人民解放军的帮助下，我们公社一级办起了毛泽东思想学习班，各个生产队也办起了毛泽东思想学习班。去年，我们公社的翻身农奴分成了对立的两大派。在学习班里，大家认真学习了毛主席的教导：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”大家说，我们翻身农奴在旧社会都是受农奴主压迫剥削的，又都是毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海中解放出来的，我们有什么根本利害冲突呢？我们分成对立的两大派，是资产阶级反动路线造成的。翻身农奴坚决听毛主席的话，通过斗私批修，各自进行自我批评，很快实现了全公社的革命大联合和三结合。八月三十日，这是我们反帝人民公社翻身农奴的大喜日子。这一天，在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，经过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，我们公社的革命委员会胜利诞生了。
    我们遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，今年在生产上也打了个大胜仗，获得了历史上最大的丰收。还克服重重困难，开垦了三百多克（一克相当一亩）荒地，劈山修渠引水，在千年不种庄稼的土地上，收获了丰硕的青稞和油菜。
    通过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，我们进一步体会到，要紧跟毛主席，就必须带着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。在我们反帝人民公社，家家都挂着毛主席像，人人都佩戴着毛主席像章，个个都会唱毛主席语录歌，我们翻身农奴走到那里，红色宝书就带到那里。学习毛主席著作已成为我们每个翻身农奴生活的第一需要。田间、地头、家庭，都成了我们活学活用毛泽东思想和斗私批修的战场。
    现在，伟大领袖毛主席又向我们发出了“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召。我们反帝人民公社革命委员会，决心进一步动员群众，调动一切积极因素，带领公社的翻身农奴，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步广泛、深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，迅速掀起斗、批、改高潮，把反帝人民公社的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把反帝人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
