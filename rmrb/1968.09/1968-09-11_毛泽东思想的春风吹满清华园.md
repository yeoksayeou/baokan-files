The golden rays of the morning sun weave Tsinghua University into a tapestry of splendor. The melody of "The East Is Red" echoes through the morning sky. On the playgrounds and under the shade of the trees, groups of people are deeply engrossed in studying the works of Chairman Mao. Bright red Mao Zedong Thought quotation boards, one after another, guide people forward like beacons!

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, composed of industrial workers, has brought the spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought into Tsinghua University. In a short time, Tsinghua University has undergone inspiring changes.

Workers Take the Lead

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the help of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the workers of Tsinghua University have taken the lead and become the masters. This is an unprecedented event in the history of Tsinghua University. In the past, under the rule of revisionism, the workers of old Tsinghua were treated as mere speaking tools, with no political status and economic discrimination. The personnel of Tsinghua were divided into three categories and nine ranks, with workers at the bottom. But now, look! Workers are leading assistant lecturers and lecturers to study the works of Chairman Mao. The history of Tsinghua University, which was once overturned by the bourgeoisie, has been completely overturned. Workers not only dare to lead but also lead effectively.

The Agricultural Machinery Department, with more than seventy faculty and staff, quickly elected five veteran workers to lead everyone in studying the works of Chairman Mao after carefully studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest directive to "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work."

Old worker Zhu Dengke said, "Under the rule of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the workers of Tsinghua University could not hold their heads high. Today, under the radiant light of the red sun in our hearts, the workers' backs are straight, and the working class will forever lead the school."

The enthusiasm of the old workers leading the study classes is very high! They are busy during the day and busy at night, sometimes working until late at night before going home. One day, old worker Sun Yue said to Zhu Dengke, "We must run the study class well. Let's just move to the school to live!" Zhu Dengke agreed, "Yes, yes! Let's move here to live, so we don't have to run back and forth." Although they were once from two different factions, they united to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Tsinghua University, and to unite closely around it. Sun Yue said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. There is only one red sun. What is multi-centerism? All of them go to hell! We must unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and march forward bravely!"

Every night, under the electric lights, several old workers, wearing old glasses, are deeply engrossed in studying the works of Chairman Mao and seriously discussing the next day's study plan.

Under the leadership of the workers, the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Agricultural Machinery Department is running very well. Old workers take the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, setting examples everywhere, and guiding everyone forward. A lecturer was so moved during the study that she shed tears. She recalled that ten years ago, before graduating from Tsinghua University, she participated in the performance of the play "Ten Years Later." This play completely depicted the revisionist future for bourgeois intellectuals: it said that the graduates of this school had become inventors, engineers, and so on. She said, "I was poisoned by revisionism. If it were not for this proletarian Cultural Revolution, and if it were not for the working class to lead the school, we would have become revisionists. I must follow Chairman Mao closely, learn from the working class, and transform my non-proletarian worldview."

New Vitality

The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought has swept through Tsinghua University, bringing great encouragement to many enthusiastic activists who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. Under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, they are displaying boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and are fighting on the front lines of the educational revolution.

For more than a month, the Tibetan student Da Wa has been in a state of great excitement and emotion. This is the new change that the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has brought to him after entering the school. Listening to the worker teachers telling him about their family histories filled with blood and tears, he couldn't help but think of his own tragic past, and he shed tears of emotion in front of Chairman Mao's portrait several times. Da Wa, whose ancestors were all slaves for generations, was born a slave to the landlord. His uneven teeth still record the hatred of class struggle. It was Chairman Mao who liberated him, and it was Chairman Mao who made him a university student from a slave. Every time he thought of this, his heart surged with deep affection for Chairman Mao that he couldn't express in words. To defend Chairman Mao, he was ready to give everything. But the old educational system and the old Tsinghua ruled by bourgeois intellectuals suppressed him and tied his hands. He had asked himself many times: Why do Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Ou Yanghai all come from the army? Why are there so few heroes and models in schools? These questions had long gone unanswered.

The proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally made Da Wa find the answers to these questions. "Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I march forward!" To thoroughly smash the old educational system and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he bravely fought. But when the two factions of the school's mass organizations engaged in "internal warfare," he firmly withdrew. Someone "mobilized" him, saying, "Da Wa, now is the time to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with your life and blood!" He replied, "No! This is to sabotage Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Da Wa did the right thing. But how to further change the face of the school and how to carry out the educational revolution to the end, he felt powerless and lacked sufficient confidence.

It was the workers' propaganda team sent by Chairman Mao that brought the thunder of educational revolution to Tsinghua University.

Chairman Mao issued the latest directive: "To realize the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership from the working class, and there must be participation from the working masses, in conjunction with the PLA soldiers, to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance with the students, teachers, and workers of the school who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end." Da Wa excitedly said, "Now Tsinghua University has hope! With Mao Zedong Thought guiding us and the working class in power, we can overcome any difficulties, and we will definitely carry out the educational revolution to the end." Under the leadership of the propaganda team, their Mechanical Engineering Department, like other departments, quickly set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, he took the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. He also often had heart-to-heart talks with his classmates and actively assisted the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in ideological and political work.

Seeing the Direction Clearly

Some intellectuals always tend to go to extremes. In the past, some people regarded Tsinghua University as the "cradle of engineers" and were fascinated by the titles of "experts" and "engineers." Today, some people have the idea of "only reading is low," feeling that after studying for a few years, they have a "hat" of intellectuals, so they just want to "fight, criticize, and transform."

In response to this idea, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team helped them set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to raise their political awareness. They also organized teachers and students to visit factories to see how workers follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and act according to Mao Zedong Thought.

On the morning of September 3, two buses carrying 136 teachers and students from the Metallurgy Department arrived at the Beijing First General Machinery Factory, greeted by the morning sun. The worker comrades excitedly told them that the working class of this factory, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, had created outstanding production achievements and could complete the annual national plan in September.

They came to the workshop and, in front of a newly made "lathe," the workers introduced that this "lathe" had been worked on by the factory's reactionary technical "authority," the deputy chief engineer, for two years, spending more than 8,000 yuan, but it was not completed. After the Revolutionary Committee was established, the workers only used 20 days, utilizing scrap materials, and spent very little money to complete it. One innovation after another, one reform after another, attracted them and made them realize more than ever that the working class created everything, that the working class has the most knowledge, and is the most intelligent.

At the on-site criticism meeting, they received even greater education. A worker, pointing to a strange-shaped object, asked the reactionary technical "authority," "How do you use this clumsy and heavy gauge you designed? You try it yourself!" The person could not lift it or push it. The worker easily lifted a similarly used gauge created by himself with one hand, casually shaking and moving it like playing a drum. The worker comrade angrily denounced: The reactionary technical "authority" of the bourgeoisie implemented bourgeois dictatorship and enforced the "control, restrict, and suppress" system. They closed their doors and did not combine with the worker masses, so they could not come up with any inventions or innovations. But they suppressed and oppressed the workers' inventions and innovations in every possible way. However, these unlearned and incompetent reactionary "authorities" were regarded as the "eyes of the Buddha" by the capitalist roaders. Workers could not give them advice, could not touch them, could not say a word against them.

The worker comrades also enthusiastically told them: Some intellectuals are willing to combine with workers and have achieved great results. We workers welcome such intellectuals. Intellectuals can only do this to better contribute to socialist construction.

From this big criticism in the factory, the students saw the direction clearly and firmly decided on the road they should take. They said, "The worker comrades gave us a vivid lesson in Mao Zedong Thought." They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's instructions: to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we truly combine with the worker and peasant masses and not become modern-day Leafs.

Late at night, Tsinghua University is brightly lit. On the bulletin boards filled with big-character posters, new battle chapters are constantly being posted, throwing sharp spears at the Chinese Khrushchev.

It is almost midnight, and at the south gate of Tsinghua University, you can still see groups of students returning from other places. The news of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entering Tsinghua University has spread across the country, and they have returned to the familiar campus with boundless excitement. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team is welcoming them, and the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University are welcoming them. They came to the school and, together with everyone, welcomed the new battle and joined the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

### 毛泽东思想的春风吹满清华园

    毛泽东思想的春风吹满清华园
    清晨，金色的阳光，把清华园织成一片锦绣。《东方红》的乐曲在晨空中回荡。
    操场上，林荫下，一排排，一圈圈的人群，在聚精会神学习毛主席著作。红艳艳的毛主席语录牌，一个接着一个，象指路明灯一样，引导人们奋勇前进！
    由产业工人组成的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，带着毛泽东思想的春风，浩浩荡荡地开进清华园，短短的时间，清华园里发生了令人鼓舞的变化。
    学校工人起来当家作主了
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，清华大学的工人起来当家做主了，这是清华大学历史上从来没有过的事情。过去，修正主义统治的旧清华工人被当成会说话的工具，政治上没地位，经济上受排挤。清华的人员分成三类九等，工人是最底层。可现在你看吧，工人领导助教、讲师，来学习毛主席著作。被资产阶级颠倒了的清华园的历史被彻底地颠倒过来了，工人们不但敢于领导，而且领导得好。
    有七十多名教职工的农机系，在毛主席发出“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示后，他们经过认真学习，深刻领会，很快选举了五个老工人，来领导大家学习毛主席著作。老工人朱登科说，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的统治下，清华大学的工人根本抬不起头来。今天，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳的光辉照耀下，工人的腰杆子挺直了，工人阶级要永远领导学校。
    老工人领导学习班的积极性可高啦！白天忙，晚上忙，有时忙到深夜才回去。一天，老工人孙跃对朱登科老师傅说：“我们要把学习班办好，干脆咱俩搬到学校来住吧！”朱登科连连说：“对对！我们搬到这里来住吧，省得来回跑。”他们两人虽然过去是两派，可是，为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好清华大学的无产阶级文化大革命，紧紧团结到一起来了。孙跃说：“毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，红太阳只有一个。什么多中心？统统见鬼去吧！我们一定要团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，奋勇前进！”
    每天晚上，在电灯光下，几位老工人，戴着老花镜，聚精会神地学习毛主席著作，认真地讨论明天的学习计划。
    在工人的领导下，农机系毛泽东思想学习班办得很好。老工人带头斗私批修，处处做出榜样来，引导大家前进。有个讲师在学习中，感动得流下了泪来。想起十年以前，她在清华大学临毕业前，参加了话剧《十年以后》的演出。这个话剧完全是为资产阶级知识分子描摹出了修正主义的前景：说的是从这个学校毕业的学生，都成了什么发明家，什么工程师……。她说：“我中了修正主义的毒。要不是这次无产阶级文化大革命，要不是工人阶级来领导学校，我们这些人非变修了不可。我一定要紧跟毛主席，向工人阶级学习，改造自己的非无产阶级世界观。”
    新的生命力
    毛泽东思想的春风吹满了清华园，给许许多多决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，带来了新的巨大的鼓舞力量，他们在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，正焕发着冲天的革命干劲，奋战在教育革命的第一线。
    一个多月来，藏族学生达瓦的心情一直是十分兴奋和激动的。这是工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校以后，在他身上引起的新的变化。他听着工人老师傅给他讲述一桩桩血泪斑斑的家史，情不自禁地想起了自己悲惨的过去，几次面对着毛主席的画像流下了激动的热泪。达瓦，这个祖辈几代都是奴隶的儿子，一出世就成了领主家的奴隶。他那错落不齐的牙齿，至今还记载着阶级的仇恨。是毛主席解放了他，又是毛主席使他由一个奴隶成为一个大学生。每当他想起这些，心里就涌起一股对毛主席难以用语言表达的深情。为了保卫毛主席，他恨不得献出自己的一切。但是旧的教育制度，资产阶级知识分子统治的旧清华，压抑着他，束缚了他的手脚。他曾不止一次地问自己：雷锋、王杰、欧阳海，为什么都出在部队？为什么学校里就很少出现英雄模范？这些问题都长期得不到解答。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使达瓦找到了问题的答案。“毛主席挥手我前进”！为了彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，他勇敢地战斗着。可是，当学校两派群众组织大打“内战”时，他坚决地退出来了。有人“动员”他说：“达瓦，现在是用生命和鲜血保卫毛主席的革命路线的时候了！”他回答说：“不！这是破坏毛主席的革命路线。”达瓦做对了。但是怎样进一步改变学校的面貌，怎样把教育革命进行到底，他感到有力无处使，缺乏足够的信心。
    是毛主席派来的工人宣传队，给清华园带来了教育革命的春雷。
    毛主席发出了最新指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。”达瓦兴奋地说：这次清华园可有希望了！有毛泽东思想给我们指路，有工人阶级给我们掌权，再大的困难我们也能克服，我们一定能把教育革命进行到底。在宣传队的领导下，他们机械系也和其他系一样，很快办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他带头斗私批修。他还经常找同学谈心，主动协助工人毛泽东思想宣传队做思想政治工作。
    看准了方向
    少数知识分子，总是爱走极端。过去有人把清华大学看成是“工程师的摇篮”，对“专家”、“工程师”的头衔很着迷。今天有的人又产生了“唯有读书低”的思想，觉得上了几年大学落得一顶知识分子的“帽子”，所以就一心想着“斗批走”。
    针对这种思想，工人毛泽东思想宣传队帮助他们办起毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想提高他们的政治觉悟。他们还组织教师和学生到工厂里去参观，看看工人是怎样紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，按照毛泽东思想办事的。
    九月三日清晨，两辆汽车载着冶金系的一百三十六名师生，迎着朝辉来到了北京第一通用机械厂。工人同志兴奋地告诉他们，这个厂的工人阶级，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，创造了生产上的优异成绩，在九月份就可以完成全年国家计划。
    他们来到车间，在一台新制的“拉床”跟前，工人介绍说，这台“拉床”，厂里的资产阶级反动技术“权威”、副总工程师搞过两年，花了八千多元，没有搞出来。革命委员会成立后，工人只用了二十天，利用废料，花了很少的钱就搞出来了。一个个新的创造，一件件新的革新，在吸引着他们，使他们更加认识到，工人阶级创造了一切，工人阶级最有知识，最聪明。
    在现场批判会上，大家受到了更大的教育。一位工人指着一个奇形怪状的东西问那个反动技术“权威”说：你设计这样又笨又重的检具怎么使用？你自己试试看！那人前去搬搬不起，推也推不动。工人一只手轻轻举起自己创造的同样用途的一件检具，随便摇晃摆动，象玩拨郎鼓似的。工人同志愤怒地控诉道：资产阶级反动技术“权威”实行资产阶级专政，推行“管、卡、压”制度，他们闭门造车，不同工人群众结合，所以搞不出什么发明创造。对工人的发明创造却千方百计地进行打击、压制。但是，这些不学无术的反动“权威”却被走资派奉为“佛爷的眼珠子”，工人不能给他们提意见，摸不得，碰不得，工人对他们不能说半个不字。
    工人同志还热情地对他们说：有些知识分子愿意同工人结合，就做出了很大的成绩。我们工人欢迎这样的知识分子。知识分子也只有这样做，才能更好地为社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
    从工厂的这个大批判中，同学们看准了方向，坚定了自己应该走的道路。他们说，工人同志给我们上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课。他们表示：一定要遵照毛主席的指示：认真搞好斗、批、改。只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，才能真正的和工农群众结合，才不会成为现代的叶公。
    深夜，清华园里一片灯火辉煌。在那琳琅满目的大字报专栏上，还不断贴上新的战斗篇章，向中国赫鲁晓夫掷出锐利的投枪。
    快到午夜了，在清华园的南门，还见到三五成群的同学从外地回来。工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进了清华园的消息，传遍了全国各地，他们怀着无比兴奋的心情，踏进了久别的校园。工人毛泽东思想宣传队在欢迎他们，清华大学的革命师生在欢迎他们。他们来到学校，同大家一起，迎接新的战斗，投入伟大的斗、批、改高潮。　本报记者
