The spring breeze has brought joy to the people. Under the auspices of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary model operas, personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, have once again taken the stage in the capital. The towering figures of Li Yuhe, Yang Zhirong, Guo Jian'guang, Fang Haizhen, Yang Weicai, and others, shining with the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, stand proudly on the socialist stage of arts. We, the working class of the capital, standing by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao, love to watch such revolutionary model operas. We could watch a thousand performances and still not have enough; we could watch a thousand times and still not be satisfied. Revolutionary model operas are good! Very good! Excellent!

The Dictatorship of the Proletariat on the Stage of Arts

On the stage of arts, is it the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses who dominate, or is it the workers, peasants, and soldiers who dominate? This is a major issue of which class exercises dictatorship in the realm of arts. The exploiting classes use every means to let emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses dominate the stage of arts, so as to exercise the dictatorship of the exploiting classes in the realm of arts. The heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers striding onto the stage of arts and driving away the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses is to exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat in the realm of arts.

On all the old stages of arts, what was exercised was the dictatorship of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie. The feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie controlled the power of arts, singing praises of themselves and erecting monuments and biographies. Year after year, generation after generation, hundreds and thousands of plays performed emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses. Emperors and generals strutted on the stage of arts, young masters and misses acted coyly. The laboring people who created history were either not allowed on stage or were maliciously distorted. History was turned upside down.

Under the dictatorship of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of arts led by the Chinese Khrushchev, what kind of dictatorship was exercised on the stage of arts? It was still the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. A handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists who usurped the leadership positions in the arts circle, relying on the Chinese Khrushchev as their backer, continued to perform emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses on the stage of arts in the new socialist China, singing praises and raising flags for the long-dead feudal class and the overthrown bourgeoisie. This bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to oppose the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers from taking the stage of arts, adopted two tactics. One was to shout that traditional operas have a high level and cannot be changed, claiming that they should start from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors and write 360 volumes, performing one a day, without a day's rest, letting emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses dominate the stage of arts forever. The other was to advocate the "middle character theory," depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers as "neither good nor bad," "both good and bad," "mediocre," and "the common people." For more than a decade, the dead and foreigners dominated our stage of arts. As Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out: "In the entire arts circle, there is a lot of talk and performance about 'fame,' 'foreign,' and 'ancient,' filled with a foul atmosphere of valuing the past over the present, admiring the foreign over the domestic, and valuing the dead over the living." History was still turned upside down. What else is this if not the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie?

"The wrath of the heavenly soldiers surges to the heavens." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of arts, the revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, "sail through the fog," breaking through the numerous obstacles and resistances of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of arts, and marched into the arts battlefield. A large group of brilliant heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, striding onto the stage of arts, have become the protagonists. The history that was turned upside down has been turned right side up again! In the past, the "seal" on the stage of arts was in the hands of emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses; now, this "seal" is in the hands of us workers, peasants, and soldiers! This is a great revolution on the stage of arts: the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie has collapsed, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has been established!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, precisely to maintain their power." He also teaches us: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion, one must first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this."

In feudal and capitalist societies, the reactionary ruling class exercises the dictatorship of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie on the stage of arts to propagate the ideals, demands, and wishes of their class, to change the world according to the image of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and to maintain and consolidate their power.

The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists under the dictatorship of the proletariat, exercising the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie on the stage of arts, aim to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, poison the people, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, and restore capitalism.

The victorious birth of the revolutionary model operas, the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers dominating the stage of arts, marks the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie on the stage of arts. This dictatorship declares the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot to use arts to restore capitalism, and this dictatorship will greatly promote the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of arts, and this is the great achievement of Comrade Jiang Qing!

The Radiant Heroic Figures of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary arts of the proletariat must 'sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people.'" The revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Shajiabang," "The Harbor," and "The Battle of the White-Headed Boy," the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang," and the piano accompaniment "The Red Lantern," all enthusiastically sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people, and have created a series of radiant heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. There are workers, peasants, and soldiers; there are those from the democratic revolutionary era and those from the socialist period; there are men and women, old and young. Li Yuhe, Yang Zhirong, Guo Jian'guang, Fang Haizhen, Yang Weicai, Hong Changqing, Wang Dashun, and these heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers are so respectable and lovable that they are known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as if they were our comrades living among us.

The heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the revolutionary model operas are portrayed highly. We are workers and "rough and ready," not "critics." The first standard we use to judge whether the characters in the opera are high or not is to see whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. Being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the Party, and infinitely loyal to the people is the common and most prominent feature of the heroic figures in the revolutionary model operas. Li Yuhe, Yang Zhirong, Guo Jian'guang, Fang Haizhen, Yang Weicai, Hong Changqing, all have "a heart as red as fire." They are loyal to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people, completely and thoroughly for the people, "determined to smash the thousand-year-old chains and open the fountain of happiness for the people for ten thousand generations," fighting bravely for the revolution and daring to brave fire and water for the people. Listen, in "The Battle of the White-Headed Boy," the reconnaissance platoon leader Yang Weicai says when requesting a mission: "Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, we have the determination to defeat American imperialism to the death! We guarantee to complete the glorious mission given to us by the Party." Before executing the mission and preparing to enter the battle, Yang Weicai swears to the Party: "For the revolution and the people, I am loyal and devoted, and I am willing to be crushed to pieces." Let's talk about Yang Zhirong in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." He comes from a poor family and has infinite love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. He uses the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses; he remembers Chairman Mao's teachings and fights bravely against the enemy, "entering life and death countless times to achieve merit." In the battle to annihilate the bandit "Seat Mountain Tiger," he bravely and wisely enters the tiger's den, "a heart as red as fire, turning into a sword to cut down the evil and stubborn." Yang Weicai and Yang Zhirong, why can they be "willing to be crushed to pieces for the revolution" and "dare to rush forward even if it means facing fire and mountains"? It is because they have a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the Party, and infinitely loyal to the people.

One performance of a revolutionary model opera is a vivid political lesson. The heroes in the opera educate us and inspire us to move forward! Why do we have such feelings? Because these heroes have another common feature, which is that they all have a lofty revolutionary ideal. "Determined to overthrow the old world and turn it upside down," "wishing the red flag to wave over the five continents and four seas," "holding high the red flag and marching forward bravely, straight to communism, to change the world thoroughly"—liberating all mankind and realizing communism in the world, this is their lofty revolutionary ideal. These heroes with "ambitious aspirations to soar to the heavens" fight in the forests and snowfields, "galloping in the south to kill the enemy," working day and night in the harbor. In "The Harbor," Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang, as soon as they appear on stage, stand firmly and sing passionately: "Dockworkers, with the left hand raising ten thousand bags of grain, and the right hand supporting a thousand tons of steel, for the revolution, even if the mountains are high and the seas are vast, we will definitely send this deep affection to the four corners of the world." When an accident occurred where loose-packed wheat was mistakenly loaded onto the ship instead of rice, they deeply understood that "one bag and one item are closely connected to the world's winds and clouds," first thinking of the country's honor and the responsibility to the world revolution, not caring about the sick child at home, not caring about the rain and wind, and without hesitation, bravely venturing out to sea, facing the waves, driving the motorboat, catching up with the barge, and returning the loose-packed wheat. All of this vividly shows Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang's proletarian internationalist spirit of standing on the dock, standing in the harbor, with their hearts in the country, and their eyes on the world, fully displaying the ambitious aspirations of our working class.

The third common feature of these heroes is that they are all "iron-clad warriors," daring to struggle and daring to win, possessing great heroic spirit. They are not afraid of storms and rain, not afraid of countless difficulties and dangers, "knowing that the journey is full of hardships, the more hardships, the more we move forward." They are like the pines on the top of Mount Tai, "eight thousand miles of storms cannot blow them down, nine thousand thunderbolts cannot strike them down." Whether it is Yang Zhirong, Guo Jian'guang, Yang Weicai, or Li Yuhe, Wu Qinghua, Xifeng, in front of the enemy armed to the teeth, they all show the heroic spirit of despising the enemy and overwhelming the enemy. In front of these heroes, what are "General Otani," "Seat Mountain Tiger," "Commander Hu," "White Tiger Regiment," "South Tyrant," "Huang Shiren"? They are all paper tigers. Let's look at Xifeng, an ordinary peasant girl in "The White-Haired Girl." Facing the oppression of the traitorous landlord Huang Shiren, she sings with the strongest voice of the poor and lower-middle peasants: "If you want to kill me, you are blind. You cannot scoop dry the water, you cannot extinguish the fire. I will not die, I will live, I will take revenge, I will live," fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of resistance of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the excellent qualities of the most reliable ally of the working class. Li Yuhe, a good representative of the railway workers with a glorious tradition of struggle, says what when wearing shackles and chains in prison? "Just because I wear iron shackles and chains, locking my feet and hands, it cannot lock my ambitious aspirations to soar to the heavens. You, bird Otani, want the secret document, using all kinds of torture, breaking my bones, tearing my flesh, my will is even firmer," "I am a strong and unyielding iron man, unyielding and unyielding in fighting the enemy! I am not afraid of torture, even if my bones are broken and my flesh is torn. I am not afraid of prison, even if I sit at the bottom of the prison." Li Yuhe's heroic words deeply reveal the heroic spirit of the working class.

The heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the revolutionary model operas are the representatives of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They share the same fate and breathe the same air with the masses, closely connecting with the masses, coming from the masses, and going to the masses. This is their fourth common feature. The "Deep Mountain Inquiry" and "Mobilizing the Masses" in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and the "Fish-Water Relationship" between the army and the people in "Shajiabang," vividly reflect the blood ties between the heroic figures such as Yang Zhirong and Guo Jian'guang and the people. The heroic struggle of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers is representative of the interests of the broad masses of the people and is supported by the broad masses of the people. In the "Transfer" scene of "Shajiabang," Guo Jian'guang and Grandma Sha's duet truly and deeply shows the fish-water relationship and flesh-and-blood connection between the people's army and the people. "Comrades fight the enemy and win honors, Shajiabang is your home," "You treat comrades as your own family, taking care of them with all your heart," ... the love between the army and the people, the people supporting the army, the fish-water relationship, is vividly and vividly displayed.

"Mao Zedong Thought illuminates my heart." The heroes in the revolutionary model operas are all revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they advance along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and they act according to the teachings of Chairman Mao. "The wind of the ship, the lighthouse of the ship, the wind sends us to break through ten thousand waves, the lighthouse lights up our ten thousand-mile journey." This wind of the ship, this lighthouse of the ship, is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Why can these heroic figures "have a heart of red for the people," why can they "have ambitious aspirations to soar to the heavens," why can they "unyieldingly fight the enemy," why can they have a blood tie with the masses? It is because they "have the sun in their hearts," and their hearts have the reddest red sun!

"Do as a person should do," these tall heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers are good examples for us to learn from; "do as a thing should be done," we should advance bravely along the footsteps of these heroic figures.

"Counting the heroes of the times, look at today." We firmly believe that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of arts and the direct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, our socialist stage of arts will surely present more and taller heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

A New Chapter in the Creation of Heroic Figures of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The life reflected in literary works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal." The revolutionary model operas are such unprecedented and best artistic treasures.

In the class struggle against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the proletariat has produced countless heroic figures worthy of song and praise. "Heroes stand out in the battle between two armies." The revolutionary model operas powerfully display the magnificent scene of class struggle with distinct characteristics of the times, and through fierce struggles against the enemy, they create a series of heroic figures.

"The Harbor" places the main characters in the fierce struggle between two classes and two roads, using the highest tone and the most vivid colors to create the heroic characters of Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang who are "loyal to the people and loyal to the Party." They never forget class struggle and remember that "in victory, we must keep our heads clear, and on the journey, there is class struggle everywhere." They "know that the waves are terrifying," but they "bravely go to the stormy sea," with the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class, they find the loose-packed wheat and smash the arrogant attack of the bourgeoisie. The fierce class struggle vividly and vividly highlights the heroic spirit of Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang "adding fighting spirit in the storm and rain."

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" displays the scene of the Communist Party and the Kuomintang bandits fighting to the death during the War of Liberation. The scenes "Taking the Tiger Mountain" and "Entering the Bandit's Den" vividly depict Yang Zhirong's calmness, bravery, and heroic spirit in the tiger's den. Even after Lin Ping suddenly appears on the mountain, Yang Zhirong remains fearless and, with high revolutionary spirit, overcomes Lin Ping, finally annihilating "Seat Mountain Tiger." It is precisely in the struggle against the cruel and brutal bandits that Yang Zhirong appears even taller, showing the heroic spirit of the communist warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who is invincible and will never be defeated by the enemy.

The brilliant revolutionary model operas, from different aspects, display the class struggle of different historical periods, and create a series of tall and perfect heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which are both a high degree of unity of individuality and class nature, and a high degree of unity of thought and art.

The pearls in the treasury of proletarian arts, using the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, successfully create the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, opening up an extremely broad horizon for the new proletarian revolutionary arts.

The heroic figures in the revolutionary model operas are very "like" the revolutionary heroes in real life. The heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers such as Yang Zhirong, Yang Weicai, Fang Haizhen, and Gao Zhiyang, who have "full of hatred for the old society" and "full of loyalty to the Party and the people," with the ambitious aspirations to liberate all mankind, are the true reflection of the excellent qualities of countless revolutionary heroes in real life.

The heroic figures created in the revolutionary model operas are even taller than those in real life. "The Battle of the White-Headed Boy" is based on a true story. Yang Weicai, with a deep hatred for the class, joins the army and the Party to make a revolution, thinking of the suffering of his family and the class brothers, seeing "how many people in the world suffer," his political awareness leaps to the height of communism, "determined to let the glory of Mao Zedong Thought shine on the world." From Yang Weicai, we see the most beautiful qualities of heroes like Qiu Shaoyun and Luo Shengtao, but the script, through high concentration and generalization, makes Yang Weicai appear even taller and more typical.

In the creation of heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the revolutionary model operas are also a brilliant example of implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "using the past to serve the present and using foreign things to serve China."

"Using the past to serve the present and using foreign things to serve China" means to use them to create heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The ancient Chinese opera art, the ancient Western ballet, symphony, and piano art, for hundreds of years, have been controlled by the reactionary ruling class, exclusively performing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Today, they must serve proletarian politics, sing the praises of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their content has undergone a fundamental change, so their form must also be critically transformed and innovated.

The five revolutionary modern Beijing operas both retain some characteristics of Beijing opera art and have great breakthroughs and innovations. In the "Fight on the Execution Ground" scene of "The Red Lantern," the exaggerated techniques of Beijing opera art are used, and the stage arrangement highlights the contrast between the positive and negative characters, highlighting the firmness and greatness of the proletarian iron man from the contrast, vividly highlighting Li Yuhe's indomitable will and heroic spirit of overwhelming all rotten and reactionary forces. To fully express Li Yuhe's revolutionary passion, "The Red Lantern" also breaks the old format and singing style of Beijing opera, creating the magnificent and heroic singing section "Ambitious Aspirations to Soar to the Heavens," singing out his lofty ideals for the revolutionary cause and his firm belief in the victory of the revolution, deeply revealing Li Yuhe's lofty spiritual realm of cherishing the country and looking to the world.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" and the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" break through the old rules and conventions of foreign symphony and ballet art, both playing to the strengths of symphony and ballet art and adding our workers, peasants, and soldiers' favorite national instruments and folk dances, opening up a new path for the proletarian symphony and ballet art.

Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing is the vanguard warrior of the proletarian arts revolution. It is she who, holding high the banner of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of arts, bravely stands at the forefront of the class struggle, leading the revolutionary arts warriors to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of arts, capturing one fortress after another on the arts battlefield; it is she who, with the spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, carefully guides and personally cultivates one brilliant revolutionary model opera after another, making a large group of towering heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers stand on the stage of arts; it is she who, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, pursues perfection, giving extremely precious specific instructions on every move, every word, every badge, every hat insignia, every piece of clothing, every beat, every light, of the main heroic characters in the opera, pointing the way for the creation of revolutionary model operas. Comrade Jiang Qing is our shining example to learn from.

Under the sun of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, riding on the roaring train of the times, roar into the garden of socialist arts. This is not just a few figures entering, but a large number of figures entering. This is not just a temporary appearance on stage, but standing firmly, standing to the end, standing forever!

We warmly welcome the brilliant blooming of the most brilliant and splendid new arts of the proletariat! We sing passionately about the great new era of the working class leading everything! We sincerely wish our heart's reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    工农兵英雄的壮丽颂歌
    ——赞革命样板戏
    北京邮票厂工人　戈中博　北京铁路局丰台机务段工人　尹振声　首都钢铁公司工人　张树棠　北京造纸厂工人　黄信诚　北京钟表厂工人　张长发
    迎来春色满人间。在全国山河一片红的大好形势下，在亿万革命人民满怀壮志豪情喜迎建国十九周年的时刻，江青同志亲自培育的震撼世界的无产阶级革命样板戏又一次在首都演出了！李玉和、杨子荣、郭建光、方海珍、杨伟才等闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的顶天立地的工农兵英雄形象，英姿焕发地屹立在社会主义文艺舞台上。我们——战斗在伟大领袖毛主席身旁的首都工人阶级，就是爱看这样的革命样板戏，有一千出一万出也不觉得多；看一千遍一万遍也看不够。革命样板戏就是好！好得很！好极了！
    文艺舞台上的无产阶级专政
    在文艺舞台上，是帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐占统治地位呢，还是工农兵占统治地位，这是由哪一个阶级在文艺领域里实行专政的大问题。剥削阶级千方百计让帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐统治文艺舞台，就是要在文艺领域里实行剥削阶级的专政。工农兵英雄形象，昂首阔步地登上文艺舞台，赶跑那些帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐，就是要在文艺领域里实行无产阶级专政。
    一切旧的文艺舞台上，实行的都是封建地主阶级的专政，资产阶级的专政。封建地主阶级和资产阶级掌握着文艺大权，一个劲地为自己歌功颂德，树碑立传。年年月月，世世代代，千百出戏，演的是帝王将相、才子佳人，唱的是老爷太太、少爷小姐。帝王将相在文艺舞台上耀武扬威，少爷小姐在文艺舞台上忸怩作态。创造历史的劳动人民，不是不准登台，就是被百般丑化。历史被颠倒了。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义文艺黑线统治下的文艺舞台上，实行的是什么专政呢？依然是资产阶级专政。窃踞文艺界领导岗位的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命修正主义分子，他们依仗中国赫鲁晓夫这个总后台，在社会主义新中国的文艺舞台上继续大演特演帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐，为早已死亡的封建阶级和被推翻的资产阶级扬幡招魂。这伙反革命修正主义分子，为了反对工农兵英雄人物登上文艺舞台，采取了两手。一手是叫嚷旧戏“水平高”
  “不能乱改”，扬言“要从三皇五帝编起，编它三百六十本，一天演一本”，一年演到头，一天也不歇，让帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐永远统治文艺舞台；一手是鼓吹“中间人物论”，要把工农兵描写成
  “不好不坏”“亦好亦坏”“中不溜儿”的“芸芸众生”。十几年来，死人、洋人统治着我们的文艺舞台。正如江青同志所指出的：“在整个文艺界，大谈大演
  ‘名’、‘洋’、‘古’，充满了厚古薄今，崇洋非中，厚死薄生的一片恶浊的空气。”历史还是被颠倒着。这不是资产阶级专政又是什么？！
    “天兵怒气冲霄汉”。在毛主席革命文艺路线指引下，江青同志亲自培育的革命样板戏，“征帆破雾行”，冲破了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的重重阻挠和种种抵抗，浩浩荡荡地开进了文艺阵地。一大群光彩照人的工农兵英雄人物，雄赳赳气昂昂地登上了文艺舞台，成为文艺舞台的主人公。被颠倒的历史再颠倒过来了！过去，文艺舞台上的“大印”，是拿在帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐手中的；如今，这个“大印”由我们工农兵来掌握了！这是文艺舞台上一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的大革命：资产阶级专政垮台了，无产阶级专政确立起来了！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”他老人家又教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”
    在封建主义和资本主义的社会里，反动统治阶级在文艺舞台上实行封建地主阶级专政和资产阶级专政，是为了宣扬他们那个阶级的理想、要求和愿望，按照地主阶级和资产阶级的面貌来改造世界，以维持和巩固他们的政权。
    无产阶级专政下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在文艺舞台上实行资产阶级专政，其目的就是为了制造反革命舆论，毒害人民群众，推翻无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义。
    革命样板戏的胜利诞生，工农兵英雄人物在文艺舞台上占统治地位，标志着无产阶级在文艺舞台上对资产阶级实行了专政。这个专政宣告了反革命修正主义分子利用文艺复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，这个专政将大大促进无产阶级政权的巩固。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，这是江青同志的丰功伟绩！
    光彩夺目的工农兵英雄形象
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：无产阶级的革命文艺必须“歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”。革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，以及钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，热情地歌颂了无产阶级和劳动人民，为我们塑造了一系列光彩夺目的工农兵英雄形象。有工，有农，有兵；有民主革命年代的，有社会主义时期的；有男有女，有老有少。李玉和、杨子荣、郭建光、方海珍、杨伟才、洪常青、王大春，这些工农兵英雄人物是那样的可敬可爱，在我们广大工农兵中间已经是家喻户晓，深入人心，如同生活在我们中间的战友一般。
    革命样板戏里的工农兵英雄形象塑造得高。我们是工人“大老粗”，不是“评论家”，我们看戏里的人物高不高，头一个标准就是要看他对毛主席忠不忠，对党忠不忠，对人民忠不忠。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于党，无限忠于人民，正是革命样板戏里英雄人物们共同的也是最突出的特点。李玉和、杨子荣、郭建光、方海珍、杨伟才、洪常青，“都有一颗红亮的心”。他们对毛主席、对党、对人民忠心耿耿，完全、彻底为人民，“一心要砸碎千年铁锁链，为人民开出万代幸福泉”，为革命英勇奋斗，为人民赴汤蹈火。你听，《奇袭白虎团》里的侦察排长杨伟才在请求任务时是怎么说的吧：“在我们伟大统帅毛主席的教导下，有誓死打败美帝国主义的决心！保证完成党交给我们的光荣任务。”在即将执行任务，准备投入战斗之前，杨伟才又向党宣誓：“为革命为人民忠心赤胆，粉身碎骨也心甘。”再说《智取威虎山》里的杨子荣吧，他出身贫苦，对伟大的领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚。他用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众；他牢记毛主席的教导，英勇杀敌，“出生入死屡建勋劳”。在消灭顽匪“座山雕”的战斗中，他英勇机智地深入虎穴，“一颗红心似火焰，化作利剑斩凶顽”。杨伟才和杨子荣，为什么能够为革命“粉身碎骨也心甘”，“哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前”，就是因为他们怀有一颗无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于党、无限忠于人民的红心。
    一出革命样板戏，就是一堂生动的政治课。戏里的英雄们，教育着我们，激励着我们前进！我们为什么能有这样的感受呢？因为这些英雄们有着另一个共同的特点，这就是他们都有崇高的革命理想。“誓把那旧世界打它个地覆天翻”，“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展”，“高举红旗勇往直前，直奔向共产主义，要把那世界彻底变个样。”——解放全人类，在全世界实现共产主义，这就是他们崇高的革命理想。这些“雄心壮志冲云天”的英雄人物，为了崇高的革命理想，战斗在林海雪原，“驰骋江南把敌杀”，日夜装卸在海港……。
  《海港》里的方海珍、高志扬一上场，就巍然屹立在舞台上，慷慨豪放地唱出：“装卸工，左手高举粮万担，右手托起千吨钢，为革命，哪怕山高海阔来阻挡，定要把这深情厚谊送往四面八方。”当发生了错把散包小麦当大米装上轮船的事故后，他们深深懂得“一包一件，紧连着世界风云”，首先想到的是祖国的荣誉和对世界革命的责任，不顾重病中的孩子，不顾风雨交加，毫不犹豫，毅然冒险出海，迎着风浪，驾驶汽艇，追上驳船，调回了散包。这一切，突出地表现了方海珍、高志扬身在码头，立足海港，胸怀祖国，放眼世界的无产阶级国际主义精神，充分显示了我们工人阶级的豪情壮志。
    这些英雄的第三个共同特点，就是：他们个个都是“铁打的金刚”，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，具有大无畏的英雄气概。他们不怕风暴雨狂，不怕千难万险，“明知征途有艰险，越是艰险越向前”。他们就象那泰山顶上的青松，“八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰”。无论是杨子荣、郭建光、杨伟才，还是李玉和、吴清华、喜儿，在武装到牙齿的敌人面前，都表现出了藐视敌人、压倒敌人的英雄气概。在这些英雄面前，什么“鸠山队长”，什么“座山雕”，什么“胡司令”，什么“白虎团”，什么“南霸天”，什么“黄世仁”，统统都不过是纸老虎。咱们看看《白毛女》里的一个普通的贫农女儿喜儿吧，面对汉奸恶霸地主黄世仁的压迫，她以贫下中农的最强音唱道：“想要逼死我，瞎了你眼窝，舀不干的水，扑不灭的火。我不死，我要活，我要报仇，我要活”，充分显示了贫下中农的革命反抗精神和工人阶级最可靠的同盟者的优秀品质。有着光荣斗争传统的铁路工人的好代表李玉和，在监狱里戴着脚镣铁链时说的是什么呢：“休看我戴铁镣裹铁链，锁住我双脚和双手，锁不住我雄心壮志冲云天。贼鸠山，要密件，毒刑用遍，筋骨断，体肤裂，意志更坚”，“孩儿我本是个刚强铁汉，不屈不挠斗敌顽！儿受刑不怕这浑身的筋骨断，儿坐牢不怕把牢底来坐穿。”李玉和的这些豪言壮语，极其深刻地展现出工人阶级的英雄本色。
    革命样板戏里的工农兵英雄形象，是广大工农兵群众的代表，他们和群众同命运共呼吸，密切联系群众，从群众中来，到群众中去，这是他们第四个共同的特点。《智取威虎山》中的“深山问苦”和“发动群众”，《沙家浜》里的军民鱼水情，突出地反映了杨子荣、郭建光等英雄人物和人民群众的血肉联系。工农兵英雄人物的可歌可泣的斗争，是代表广大人民群众利益的，又是得到广大人民群众支持的。《沙家浜》“转移”一场中郭建光和沙奶奶的对唱，真挚而深刻地表现了人民军队和人民群众鱼水相依、骨肉相连的关系。“同志们杀敌挂了花，沙家浜就是你们的家”，“你待同志亲如一家，精心调理总不差”……，军爱民，民拥军，军民之间的鱼水情，生动地、淋漓尽致地表现出来了。
    “毛泽东思想把我的心照亮。”革命样板戏里的这些英雄都是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。他们是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长起来的，他们是沿着毛主席的革命路线前进的，他们是按照毛主席的教导办事的。“行船的风，领航的灯，长风，送我们冲破千顷浪，明灯，给我们照亮了万里航程。”这行船的风，这领航的灯，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这些英雄人物为什么能够“一片红心为人民”，为什么能够“雄心壮志冲云天”，为什么能够“不屈不挠斗敌顽”，为什么能够同群众有血肉的联系？就是因为他们“胸有朝阳”，心中有着最红最红的红太阳！
    “做人要做这样的人”，这些高大的工农兵英雄形象，是我们学习的好榜样；“做事要做这样的事”，我们要沿着这些英雄人物的足迹奋勇前进。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”我们深信，在毛主席革命文艺路线的指引下，在江青同志的直接领导下，我们的社会主义文艺舞台上定将出现更多更高大的工农兵英雄形象。
    塑造工农兵英雄的新篇章
    毛主席教导我们：“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”金光闪闪的革命样板戏就是这样前所未有的最好的艺术珍品。
    无产阶级在反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的阶级斗争中，产生了无数可歌可泣的革命英雄。“两军阵前显英雄。”革命样板戏气势磅礴地展现了具有鲜明时代特征的阶级斗争的雄伟图景，通过激烈的对敌斗争塑造了一系列英雄形象。
    《海港》就是把剧中主要人物放在激烈的两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中，用最高昂的调子，最鲜明的色彩，来塑造方海珍、高志扬“忠于人民忠于党”的英雄性格的。他们念念不忘阶级斗争，牢记“胜利中须保持头脑清醒，征途上处处有阶级斗争”。他们“明知惊涛骇浪险”，“偏向风波江上行”，以工人阶级大无畏的革命精神，查出了散包，粉碎了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。激烈的阶级斗争深刻而形象地烘托出方海珍、高志扬“暴风雨更添战斗豪情”的英雄本色。
    《智取威虎山》在又一高度上展现了解放战争时期共产党同国民党匪帮短兵相接的场面。“打虎上山”和“打进匪窟”两场戏，集中描绘了杨子荣在深入虎穴中的沉着镇定，机智勇敢，威风凛凛的革命胆略。就是在栾平突然上山之后，杨子荣仍然临危不惧，以高昂的革命气势压倒栾平，最后消灭了“座山雕”。正是在对凶狠残暴的顽匪的斗争中，杨子荣显得更高大，表现出毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义战士无往而不胜，要压倒一切敌人而决不被敌人所屈服的革命英雄气概。
    光彩夺目的革命样板戏，从不同侧面展现了不同历史时期的阶级斗争，塑造了一系列高大完美的工农兵英雄形象，既是个性和阶级性的高度统一，又是思想性和艺术性的高度统一。
    无产阶级文艺宝库中的这一颗颗明珠，采用革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，异常成功地塑造了工农兵英雄形象，为无产阶级革命新文艺开拓出无比广阔的天地。
    革命样板戏中的高大英雄形象，同现实生活中的革命英雄非常“象”。象杨子荣、杨伟才、方海珍、高志扬这些对旧社会“仇满怀恨满腔”，对党、对人民一片忠心，怀着解放全人类的雄心壮志的工农兵英雄形象，正是现实生活中无数革命英雄优秀品质的真实的反映。
    革命样板戏中塑造的英雄形象又比生活中的更高大。《奇袭白虎团》是生活中的真人真事。杨伟才满怀阶级的深仇大恨，参军入党闹革命，从自家的悲惨遭遇，联想到阶级兄弟遭摧残，看到了“全世界有多少人民受苦难”，政治觉悟飞跃到“誓让毛泽东思想的光辉普照人间”的共产主义高度。从杨伟才身上，我们看到了邱少云、罗盛教等英雄战士的最美好的品质，但剧本经过高度的概括和集中，使杨伟才显得更高大，更典型。
    革命样板戏在塑造工农兵英雄形象上，又是贯彻毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”伟大方针的光辉典范。
    “古为今用，洋为中用”，就要为塑造工农兵英雄人物所用。古老的我国京剧艺术，古老的西洋芭蕾、交响乐和钢琴艺术，几百年来被反动统治阶级所把持，专门表现帝王将相，才子佳人。今天，要它们为无产阶级政治服务，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，内容发生了根本的质变，它的形式也就必须加以批判地改造，推陈出新。
    五个革命现代京剧既保留了京剧艺术特色的某些方面，又大有突破和创造。《红灯记》“刑场斗争”一场，运用了京剧艺术夸张的手法，在舞台调度上突出地表现了正面人物与反面人物的对比，从对比中衬托出无产阶级刚强铁汉的坚强与高大，非常形象地烘托出李玉和威武不屈的钢铁意志和压倒一切腐朽反动势力的英雄气概。为了尽情抒发李玉和的革命豪情，《红灯记》又打破了京剧的旧有格式和唱腔流派，创造了《雄心壮志冲云天》这套高昂雄壮的精采唱段，唱出了他对革命事业的远大理想，对革命必胜的坚定信念，深刻地展示出李玉和胸怀祖国，放眼世界的崇高精神境界。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，突破了外国交响乐和芭蕾艺术的陈规俗套，既发挥了交响乐和芭蕾艺术的特长，又加进了我们工农兵喜闻乐见的民族乐器和民间舞蹈，为无产阶级的交响音乐和芭蕾艺术开辟了崭新的道路。
    我们敬爱的江青同志是无产阶级文艺革命的先锋战士。是她，高举毛主席革命文艺路线的大旗，英勇地站在阶级斗争的最前列，率领革命文艺战士，向反革命修正主义文艺黑线举行了猛烈的进攻，攻克了艺术阵地上一个又一个的顽固堡垒；是她，以无产阶级革命家的气魄，精心指导、亲自培育了一出出光芒四射的革命样板戏，使一大群顶天立地的工农兵英雄形象屹立在文艺舞台上；是她，以高度的革命负责精神，精益求精，对剧中主要英雄人物的一招一式，一字一句，一个领章，一个帽徽，一件服装，对一板一眼，一道灯光，都十分细致地去琢磨研究，作了非常宝贵的具体指示，为革命样板戏的创作指明了道路。敬爱的江青同志是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    伟大的毛泽东思想阳光照耀下的工农兵英雄形象，乘着隆隆的时代列车，呼啸着开进了社会主义文艺园地。这不是开进来几个人物，而是要大批大批地开进来。这不是一时半时的登台，而是站定了，站到底，永远站下去了！
    我们热烈欢呼无产阶级最光辉灿烂的新文艺的百花盛开！我们纵情歌唱工人阶级领导一切的伟大新时代的到来！我们衷心敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
