The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our policy should be based on what? Based on our own strength, that is self-reliance." Since liberation, the broad revolutionary masses in China's shipbuilding industry, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have fully demonstrated the tremendous power of the self-reliance policy, achieving brilliant results. China's Khrushchev and his agents in the shipbuilding industry, out of their counter-revolutionary needs, have consistently and madly opposed Mao Zedong Thought, sabotaged Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the shipbuilding industry. They opposed Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy, claiming that "building ships is not as good as buying ships, buying ships is not as good as leasing ships," and "we shouldn't do everything ourselves." They attempted to lead China's shipbuilding industry down the path of dependence on imperialism and revisionism, turning it into a colony.

The struggle between the two lines in the shipbuilding industry is reflected in all aspects. The 8800 horsepower diesel engine, which was independently designed and manufactured by China, is a prime example.

The 8800 horsepower diesel engine was developed under the guidance of the Party's policy of "striving to build socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and excellent work." In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of workers in China's shipbuilding industry rallied with a revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to pioneer, independently designing and manufacturing the engine. Our factory was tasked with its trial production. At that time, the entire workforce was full of enthusiasm, determined to quickly produce it. However, China's Khrushchev's agents in the shipbuilding industry were superstitious about foreigners, relied on foreigners, and did not believe in the power of our workers to manufacture it. They relied on bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and "experts" to manage the factory, using old rules and foreign frameworks to constrain the initiative and creativity of our workers, suppressing the vigorous mass movement. They used the excuse that a small crack was found in the crankshaft after precision machining and magnetic flaw detection to declare the crankshaft as scrap. At that time, veteran workers, after careful analysis, believed it could be used. However, a small group of bourgeois reactionary "authorities" assumed the posture of pedantic scholars and arbitrarily decided to scrap the crankshaft, putting it in cold storage. Due to the lack of a crankshaft, the assembly of the first diesel engine was delayed for seven years.

China's Khrushchev's agents in the shipbuilding industry used various means to sabotage and delay the self-reliant production of the 8800 horsepower diesel engine. Just as this engine was in the midst of intense trial production, they were eager to copy and imitate another foreign diesel engine, diverting technical and labor forces, leaving this self-reliant diesel engine cold and neglected. We shipbuilding workers love Chairman Mao the most and are the most resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy. We are not afraid of ridicule and sarcasm; we work day and night to produce this self-reliant diesel engine to prove the power of Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy.

The reason China's Khrushchev and his ilk obstructed the production of the diesel engine was to rely on foreigners. When the first 8800 horsepower diesel engine was about to be successfully produced, these running dogs from abroad bought the patent for low-speed diesel engines at a high price, attempting to strangle the self-reliant 8800 horsepower diesel engine. Their intentions were evil. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution destroyed China's Khrushchev's black headquarters, exposing his henchmen's serious crimes of relying on foreigners and sabotaging the production of the 8800 horsepower diesel engine, opposing the self-reliance policy. They were stripped of their power, and the production of foreign low-speed diesel engines was terminated, throwing it into the dustbin of history. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a glory for us shipbuilding workers.

Since the "January Storm," the broad revolutionary workers in our factory have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." With the strong cooperation and close coordination of brother factories, we have produced the second 8800 horsepower diesel engine. The design and manufacturing quality of this engine is significantly improved and advanced compared to the first one. Currently, we are striving to produce more and better low-speed diesel engines for our motherland at an even faster pace.

We revolutionary shipbuilding workers have the ability and the spirit. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "fully mobilizing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," carry forward the daring, pioneering, and fearless revolutionary spirit, be self-reliant, and strive for progress. We will work hard to build a "railway" on the sea!

    从八千八百马力柴油机看阶级斗争
    国防工业毛泽东思想学习班老工人　谢祖勋
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”解放以来，我国造船工业的广大革命群众，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，充分发挥了自力更生方针的巨大威力，取得了光辉的成就。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在造船工业的代理人，出于他们反革命的需要，一贯疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在造船工业中推行反革命修正主义路线。他们对抗毛主席的自力更生的方针，胡说什么“造船不如买船，买船不如租船”，“不要把孙子辈的事都做了”等等，妄图将我国造船工业引向依附帝国主义、修正主义的殖民地道路。
    造船工业上的两条路线的斗争反映在各个方面。我国自行设计、自行制造的八千八百马力的柴油机，就是一个例证。
    八千八百马力柴油机，是在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的指引下，在一九五八年大跃进的推动下，我国造船工业广大职工振起了敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，自行设计，由我厂承担试制的。当时全厂职工干劲冲天，决心很快把它试制出来。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫在造船工业中的代理人，迷信外国，依赖外国，不相信我们工人自己的力量可以制造出来。他们靠资产阶级反动“权威”、“专家”治厂，用旧条条、洋框框束缚我们工人的积极性和创造性，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动压下去。他们借口柴油机曲轴精加工后经磁性探伤发现一处有微裂象征，硬把曲轴报废掉。当时，老工人们经过认真分析，认为可以使用。可是，一小撮资产阶级反动“权威”，摆出学究老爷架势，竟武断决定将曲轴报废，打入冷宫。因少曲轴无法总装，致使第一台柴油机的制成拖延了七年时间。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在造船工业中的代理人，为破坏和拖延自力更生的八千八百马力的柴油机，使用了各种手段。正当这台柴油机在紧张试制中，他们却热中于照搬照抄仿制另一台外国的柴油机，把技术力量和劳动力调走，把这台自力更生的柴油机，冷落在一旁。我们造船工人，最热爱毛主席，最坚决贯彻毛主席的自力更生的方针，我们不怕人讥笑讽刺，日夜奋战，决心把这台自力更生的柴油机试制出来，为毛主席的自力更生方针争气。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流所以阻挠柴油机的试制，正是为了要依赖外国。当第一台八千八百马力柴油机即将试制成功的时候，这些洋奴才们却丧心病狂地从外国高价买进了低速柴油机的专利权，妄图扼杀自力更生的八千八百马力柴油机，用心何其毒也。无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑司令部，揭露了他的爪牙们依靠外国，破坏八千八百马力柴油机的试制，反对自力更生方针的严重罪行，夺了他们的权，终止了外国低速柴油机的生产，把它扫进了历史的垃圾堆里。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是我们造船工人的光荣。
    我们厂的广大革命职工，从“一月风暴”以来，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，在兄弟工厂大力协作、密切配合下，造出了第二台八千八百马力柴油机，设计、制造的质量又比第一台有很大的改进和提高。目前，正以更快速度为祖国生产更多更好的低速柴油机而英勇奋战。
    我们革命的造船工人有能力，有志气，一定要遵循毛主席的“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的大无畏的革命精神，自力更生，奋发图强，为建立海上“铁路”而努力奋斗！
