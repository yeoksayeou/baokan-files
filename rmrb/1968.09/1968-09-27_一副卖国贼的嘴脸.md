The traitorous clique led by Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, in order to cooperate with the counter-revolutionary strategy of U.S. imperialism in Asia, has long been colluding with the Japanese reactionaries, engaging in so-called "Soviet-Japanese cooperation" to establish a tripartite anti-China "holy alliance" of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Japan. They are attempting to "contain" and "surround" China. For this purpose, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has stooped to the point of selling out the national sovereignty, national interests, and natural resources of the Soviet Union.

Recently, a high-ranking official of the Soviet revisionists, the Minister of Foreign Trade, Patolichev, went to Tokyo and carried out another treacherous, anti-China deal with the Japanese reactionary government.

Under the guise of "Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation" and "developing" the forest resources of Siberia, Patolichev had frequent meetings and "consultations" with the leaders of the Japanese reactionary government and the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups. He shamelessly flaunted himself, making a fool of himself, and in a disgusting and shameless manner, begged for the "cooperation" of the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups. He even said that such "cooperation" is "indispensable" for the "development" of the Soviet Far East region. Patolichev's treacherous acts won the "appreciation" of the Japanese reactionaries. His ugly appearance is truly nauseating, to the extent that even the Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese reactionary government, Kimura Toshio, thought that he "didn't look like a government minister" but "like a lowly Japanese merchant."

Now, let us take a look at the performance of this minister and the Japanese reactionaries singing in unison, and it will be clear at a glance.

The Soviet revisionists and the Japanese reactionary government exchanged documents on the so-called "development" of Siberian forest resources. The Japanese monopoly capitalist groups agreed to provide the Soviet revisionists with a batch of "machinery and equipment" for "developing" forest resources on credit. The Soviet revisionists agreed to supply Japan with 80 million cubic meters of timber from Siberia over the next five years as a reward. What a pathetic sight! The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is not satisfied with such humiliating conditions. Patolichev said that "Soviet-Japanese cooperation" should "consider various methods" and "make further efforts." He even begged the Japanese reactionary government to lay pipelines across Siberia for the Soviet Union, to "develop" natural gas and the oil, coal, copper, and iron sand resources of Siberia. He even agreed to allow the Japanese reactionary government to send delegations to "inspect" the port facilities of Siberia, opening the door wide for the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups and special agents to pour into the Soviet Union.

When Japanese Prime Minister Sato expressed dissatisfaction with the existing Japan-Soviet aviation agreement, Patolichev immediately said that the agreement would be amended when it expires next April, preparing to further sell out the sovereignty of Soviet airspace.

The national sovereignty of the Soviet Union and the vast lands of Siberia have been sold out in this way by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. No wonder even the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups think that the exchange of documents and contracts on the "development" of Siberian forest resources between the Soviet Union and Japan is "remarkable."

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's selling out of the sovereignty and natural resources of Siberia not only shows that the Soviet revisionists are in dire economic straits and are trying to rely on the economic power of Japanese monopoly capitalism to accelerate the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, but also further indicates that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in order to collude with the Japanese reactionaries, is using the name of "developing" Siberia to carry out the actual plan of "surrounding" China.

However, history has mercilessly mocked the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Under the leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great socialist motherland has never been as strong as it is today, making the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and all reactionaries around the world tremble with fear. Today, any conspiracy by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to collude with the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to carry out anti-China activities is doomed to fail and will surely meet with defeat.

We firmly believe that the Soviet people, taught by the great Lenin and Stalin, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, tempered and tested by the anti-fascist war, will surely punish the traitors Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Patolichev, and will not forgive this small group of traitors for selling out the national sovereignty and national interests of the Soviet Union. As our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches: "The broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of the Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good, they are revolutionary, and the rule of revisionism will not last long." The proletariat and revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will surely unite under the banner of the great October Revolution, inherit the cause of Lenin and Stalin, and wage a tenacious struggle to break through the darkness, making the red star of the October Revolution shine brightly again!

    一副卖国贼的嘴脸
    永红
    以赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为代表的苏修叛徒集团，为了配合美帝国主义在亚洲的反革命战略的需要，一直在勾结日本反动派，进行所谓“苏日合作”，建立美、苏、日三家合营的反华“神圣同盟”，妄图“遏制”和“包围”中国。为此，苏修叛徒集团不惜堕落到出卖苏联的国家主权、民族利益和自然资源。
    不久前，苏修的一名头目，对外贸易部部长帕托利切夫跑到东京，和日本反动政府干了又一桩卖国反华的交易。
    帕托利切夫打着“苏日经济合作”、“开发”西伯利亚森林资源的招牌，与日本反动政府的头目们和日本垄断资本集团进行了频繁的接触。左一个会晤，右一个“恳谈”，帕托利切夫大肆卖弄风骚，出尽洋相，闹得乌烟瘴气，厚颜无耻地乞求日本垄断资本集团的“合作”，并表示这种“合作”，对于“开发”苏联的远东地区是“不可缺少的”。帕托利切夫的叛卖行径，博得了日本反动派的“欣赏”。他的丑态，真是令人作呕，竟连日本反动政府的官房长官木村俊夫都认为，“简直不象是政府部长”，而“象一个低三下四的日本商人”。
    现在，让我们看看这位部长和日本反动派一唱一和的表演，也就一目了然了。
    苏修和日本反动政府交换了所谓的“开发”西伯利亚森林资源的文件，日本垄断资本集团答应赊给苏修一批“开发”森林资源的“机械设备”；苏修答应在今后的五年之内向日本供应西伯利亚的八百多万立方米的木材，作为报答。真是一副可怜相！苏修叛徒集团居然对这样屈辱的条件还嫌不够，帕托利切夫表示“苏日合作”“要考虑种种方法”，要“进一步努力”，竟乞求日本反动政府为苏修敷设穿过西伯利亚的石油管道，“开发”天然气和西伯利亚的石油、煤炭、铜矿、铁砂等地下资源，甚至还同意日本反动政府派遣代表团对西伯利亚的港湾设施进行“考察”……，为日本垄断资本集团和特务间谍大举拥进苏联敞开大门。
    当日本首相佐藤表示对现有的日苏航空协定还感到不满足时，帕托利切夫立刻表示待该协定明年四月期满时，再行修改，准备进一步出卖苏联的领空权。
    苏联的国家主权和西伯利亚的大好河山，被苏修叛徒集团就这样地出卖了。难怪连日本垄断资本集团都认为，苏日交换“开发”西伯利亚森林资源的文件和签订的合同，是“引人注目”的。
    苏修叛徒集团出卖西伯利亚的主权和自然资源，除了说明苏修国内经济困难重重，企图依赖日本垄断资本的经济力量，加速苏联资本主义的全面复辟以外，还进一步表明，苏修叛徒集团为了勾结日本反动派，借“开发”西伯利亚之名，行“包围”中国之实。
    然而，历史无情地嘲弄了苏修叛徒集团。在以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，经过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，从来没有象今天这样强大，使得美帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团和世界上一切反动派胆颤心惊。今天，苏修叛徒集团勾结美、日反动派进行反华的任何阴谋是永远不会得逞，注定要破产的。
    我们坚信，由伟大的列宁和斯大林所教导的、有着十月革命光荣传统的、经过了反法西斯战争锻炼和考验的苏联人民，一定会惩罚勃列日涅夫、柯西金和帕托利切夫之流的卖国贼，决不会饶恕这一小撮叛徒出卖苏联国家主权和民族利益的一切行径。正如我们伟大导师毛主席教导的：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏联无产阶级和革命人民，一定会在伟大十月革命的旗帜下团结起来，继承列宁、斯大林的遗志，展开英勇顽强的斗争，冲破重重黑暗，使十月革命的红星，重新放射出灿烂的光芒！
