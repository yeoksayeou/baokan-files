The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "We should not close the door to run a newspaper. We should face the masses, have a clear direction, and be fresh and lively." This is the fundamental policy for running a good proletarian newspaper, pointing out the bright path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers for proletarian journalists.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the journalism field, such as Deng Tuo and Wu Lengxi, fiercely resist Chairman Mao's proletarian newspaper policy, promoting a revisionist journalism line of "experts running newspapers" and "closing the door to run a newspaper." Their so-called "experts running newspapers" is to rely on traitors, spies, running dogs, reactionary literati, and reactionary academic "authorities" to run newspapers, handing over this important propaganda front of the proletarian newspaper to them, allowing them to carry out anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil schemes. Under the direction of the Chinese Khrushchev, they collude with each other, using each other, for their common "political needs." They use insidious and vicious methods such as borrowing from the past to criticize the present, hinting at one thing while meaning another, and beating around the bush to vent their deep-seated class hatred towards the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, shooting arrow after arrow in the dark. Works like "Li Huiniang" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" were all created to build counter-revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the journalism field, Wu Lengxi and the like, try their best to block Chairman Mao's voice, resist the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, and keep the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers out of the door. They claim that workers, peasants, and soldiers have no culture, no knowledge, and can only use hammers, hoes, and gun barrels, and cannot even write a few words on two sheets of paper. In this way, they suppress a large number of fresh, lively, and full-of-life articles written by workers, peasants, and soldiers who study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, praise the great leader Chairman Mao, and shout loudly for the socialist revolution.

Who says workers, peasants, and soldiers have no culture? Who says workers, peasants, and soldiers have no knowledge? This is purely turning black into white and confusing right and wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the richest in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment practice experience. We create culture and history. We workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the masters of history but also the masters of culture, and the main force of running newspapers. The reason they keep workers, peasants, and soldiers out of the door is that they are afraid that workers, peasants, and soldiers who grasp Mao Zedong Thought will occupy the newspaper propaganda front, making their dream of seizing the leadership of the newspaper to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism impossible. We must confront them head-on, firmly grasp the leadership of the newspaper in the hands of the working class, making it a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, making it a powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The working class must lead everything. We have Chairman Mao backing us up, and we will definitely be able to lead everything, definitely be able to lead the newspaper, and the newspaper will be run better and better. Let the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the journalism field tremble before us! Let the revisionist journalism line of "experts running newspapers" and "closing the door to run a newspaper" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

### 工农兵是新闻战线上的主力军

    工农兵是新闻战线上的主力军
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“不应当关门办报，应面向群众，又要有大方向，又要新鲜活泼。”这是办好无产阶级报纸的根本方针，为无产阶级新闻工作者指出了同工农兵相结合的光明大道。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新闻界的代理人邓拓、吴冷西之流，疯狂地抵制毛主席的无产阶级办报路线，推行了一条“专家办报”、“关门办报”的修正主义新闻路线。他们的所谓“专家办报”，就是依靠那些叛徒、特务、汉奸、反动文人、反动学术“权威”办报，把无产阶级报纸这个重要宣传阵地拱手让给他们，让他们进行反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当。在中国赫鲁晓夫指使下，他们互相勾结，互相利用，为了共同的“政治上的需要”，他们采取借古讽今、指桑骂槐、旁敲侧击等阴险毒辣的手法，向党、向伟大领袖毛主席发泄他们刻骨的阶级仇恨，射出了一支又一支暗箭，什么《李慧娘》、《海瑞罢官》等毒草都先后炮制出来，为复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新闻界的代理人吴冷西之流，极力封锁毛主席的声音，抗拒无产阶级司令部的领导，把广大工农兵关在门外。他们胡说什么工农兵没有文化，没有知识，只能拿锤头、锄头、枪杆子，两张纸也写不出一点东西。就这样，他们把大量工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，为社会主义革命大叫大喊的新鲜活泼、很有生气的文章扣压下来。
    谁说工农兵没有文化？谁说工农兵没有知识？这纯粹是颠倒黑白，混淆是非。毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们工农兵最富有阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的实践经验，是我们创造了文化，创造了历史。我们工农兵不但是历史的主人，也是文化的主人，是办报的主力军。他们之所以把工农兵关在门外，其目的就是怕掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵占领报纸这个宣传阵地，使他们篡夺报纸领导权为复辟资本主义制造舆论的美梦不能得逞。我们就是要针锋相对，把报纸的领导权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里，使之成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器，使之成为无产阶级专政的强有力的工具。
    工人阶级必须领导一切。我们有毛主席为我们撑腰，也一定能够领导一切，也一定能领导报纸，报纸也将越办越好。让中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新闻界的代理人在我们面前发抖吧！让中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“专家办报”、“关门办报”的修正主义新闻路线见鬼去吧！
