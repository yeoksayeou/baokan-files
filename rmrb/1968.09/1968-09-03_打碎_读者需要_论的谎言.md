The Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously promoting the "reader needs" theory in our news industry, claiming things like "your (reporters') only task is to write for the readers" and "New China News Agency's articles should meet the readers' needs." All of these are lies, they are superclass bourgeois slogans.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Before the elimination of classes, regardless of newspapers, periodicals, radio, or news agencies, all have class characteristics and serve a particular class. Different classes have different, even completely opposite, likes and dislikes. Any article, news item, or newspaper can only reflect the interests of a particular class and meet the needs of a particular class, but it cannot serve all classes and be welcomed by all classes. The Chinese Khrushchev's "reader needs" theory is utterly absurd.

Facts speak louder than words. During a certain period, our Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went to a remote mountain village to carry out a mission. In the village, there were two elderly poor peasants, both over seventy years old. One day, they discovered that there was grain mixed in with the chaff piled in the courtyard, so they voluntarily got up early and stayed up late, sifting the grain out of the chaff bit by bit and turning it over to the collective. Their spirit of selflessness was praised by the broad masses of community members. However, a landlord surnamed Guo fabricated lies and spread rumors, falsely accusing these two elderly poor peasants of "stealing the collective's grain," attempting to sow discord among the poor and lower-middle peasants and sabotage the collective economy. The reality of class struggle in the countryside educated me, making me feel that I had to write about this incident. Therefore, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," I wrote an article for the newspaper, praising the poor peasant community members who follow Chairman Mao's words and work selflessly, and exposing the evil activities of the class enemy. After the article was published in the newspaper, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants all clapped their hands in approval, excitedly telling me, "This article is reasonable, it speaks for our hearts, we feel energized after reading it!" Some poor and lower-middle peasant community members even actively provided me with materials, asking me to write more such articles. However, the class enemies had a completely different reaction. They hid in dark corners spreading malicious rumors, saying, "There's no such thing, making up stories is useless!"

The harsh facts have shattered the Chinese Khrushchev's lies. For the same article, the poor and lower-middle peasants welcome it and need it, while the class enemies fear it and oppose it. This shows that the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people have fundamentally no common "needs" with the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We must not be fooled by the Chinese Khrushchev; we must firmly stand on the proletarian standpoint, firmly grasp all news work in our own hands, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship.

    打碎“读者需要”论的谎言
    四七一九部队战士  徐忠凯
    中国赫鲁晓夫向我国新闻界大肆鼓吹“读者需要”论，什么“你们（记者）唯一的任务是写给读者看”呀，什么“新华社的稿件”“要适合读者的需要”呀，等等，这些东西统统是欺人之谈，是超阶级的资产阶级口号。
    毛主席教导我们：在阶级消灭之前，不管报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社都有阶级性，都是为一定阶级服务的。不同的阶级有着不同的甚至完全相反的爱憎。任何一篇文章、一则新闻、一张报纸，都只能反映一定阶级的利益，适合一定阶级的需要，而决不能为各个阶级服务，为各个阶级欢迎。中国赫鲁晓夫的“读者需要”论，是绝顶荒谬的。
    事实胜于雄辩。有个时期，我们毛泽东思想宣传队到一个偏僻的山村执行任务。村里有两个贫农老大爷，都七十多岁了。一天，他们发现场院堆的秕糠里有粮食，就自动地起早贪晚，把粮食从秕糠里一点一点筛出来，交给集体。他们这种一心为公的精神，受到了广大社员的一致称赞。可是，有个姓郭的地主分子，却无中生有，造谣惑众，诬蔑这两个老贫农“偷队里的粮食”，企图挑拨贫下中农的关系，破坏集体经济。农村阶级斗争的现实教育了我，使我感到非把这事写出来不可。于是，我遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，给报社写了一篇稿子，歌颂了听毛主席的话、一心为公的贫农社员，揭露了阶级敌人的罪恶活动。稿子在报纸上登出以后，广大贫下中农无不拍手称快，激动地对我说：“这事写得在理，说出了我们的心里话，我们看了浑身是劲！”有的贫下中农社员还主动向我介绍材料，让我多写这样的文章。可是，阶级敌人却完全是另一种反映。他们躲在阴暗的角落里散布流言蜚语，说：“那有这种事，瞎编没有用！”
    无情的事实，打碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的谎言。对于同一篇文章，贫下中农欢迎它，需要它，阶级敌人却害怕它，反对它。这说明，无产阶级和广大劳动人民同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级根本不可能有什么共同的“需要”。我们决不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当；必须坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，把一切新闻事业牢牢掌握在自己的手里，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远为广大工农兵服务，为加强无产阶级专政服务。
