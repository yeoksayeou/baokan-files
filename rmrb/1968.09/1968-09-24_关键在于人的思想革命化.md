The so-called theory of emphasizing politics by focusing on business, proposed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, is a rehash of the pure military viewpoint that Chairman Mao criticized more than thirty years ago. They put forward these fallacies in an attempt to lead the proletarian army astray, making us indifferent to politics, detached from class struggle, abandoning ideological reform, and constantly revolving around "business." Their ultimate goal is to fundamentally change the nature of our army, seize control of the military, oppose the party, and restore capitalism. This is sheer delusion!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. He also said, "Without the correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." Emphasizing proletarian politics is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, to lead with Mao Zedong Thought, to revolutionize people's thoughts, to make the boundless Mao Zedong Thought our soul, and to cultivate millions of soldiers like Zhang Side, Lei Feng, Li Wenzhong, and Meng He, who are dedicated to the public, fear neither hardship nor death, and serve the people of the whole of China and the world wholeheartedly. They are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the fundamental guarantee for our country to remain unchanged for generations, and it is the greatest guarantee for us to defeat the enemy.

The facts are clear: Emphasizing politics and focusing on the revolutionization of people's thoughts can produce immense spiritual power. Great spiritual achievements will turn into great material power, and such spiritual achievements will always be effective. However, some people always feel that emphasizing politics and focusing on the revolutionization of thoughts is still "too abstract," saying that focusing on the revolutionization of thoughts is intangible. This is precisely the result of being poisoned by the "emphasizing politics by focusing on business" propaganda spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing.

The revolutionization of people's thoughts will inevitably turn into great material power. After I enlisted in 1961, following the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, I firmly walked the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, leading with Mao Zedong Thought, and worked hard on the revolutionization of thoughts. I gradually understood: Living for oneself is most shameful, while living for the people is most meaningful. Therefore, in the face of frequent changes in work, I remained steadfast in following Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao in the revolution, and doing as Chairman Mao instructs. No matter how much the work changes, the essence of a proletarian revolutionary soldier does not change, the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly does not change, and the red heart of being loyal to Chairman Mao forever does not change. When Chairman Mao assigned me to be a radio operator, I led with politics over business and worked actively to contribute to the creation of a four-good platoon that is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When Chairman Mao instructed me to go to the countryside to do mass work, I enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the people. Last spring, in response to Chairman Mao's battle call, I went to the production brigade near the station to support agriculture. I worked with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to seriously implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasping revolution and promoting production." Despite the attacks, insults, and slander by a handful of class enemies, my resolve to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death was not shaken in the slightest. In February this year, when the old soldiers were demobilized, I was assigned to be a cook, and I happily accepted the assignment, vowing to be a Zhang Side who cooks. All of these are the results of the revolutionization of thoughts.

Emphasizing proletarian politics cannot be implemented through business; it must be implemented through the revolutionization of people's thoughts. This is the need of class struggle and the need to oppose revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Years of practice have made me deeply realize: Among all treasures, Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious; among all important things, leading with Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionizing people's thoughts is the most important.

    关键在于人的思想革命化
    空军某部五好战士　张基鹏
    中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，提出所谓突出政治要落实到业务上的谬论，是毛主席早在三十多年前就批判过的单纯军事观点的翻版。他们提出这些谬论是妄图把无产阶级军队引向歧途，使我们不问政治，脱离阶级斗争，放弃思想改造，成天围着“业务”转，从根本上改变我军的性质，以达到他们篡军、反党，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。这是痴心妄想！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。又说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”突出无产阶级政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，就是以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，把光焰无际的毛泽东思想化为我们的灵魂，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想培育千千万万个象张思德、雷锋、李文忠、门合那样一心为公，一生为公，一不怕苦，二不怕死，全心全意地为全中国人民和全世界人民服务，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的好战士。这是我们国家千秋万代永不变色的根本保证，是我们战胜敌人的最大保证。
    事实很清楚，突出政治落实到人的思想革命化，就能产生巨大的精神力量，巨大的精神成果就会转化为巨大的物质力量，而且这种精神成果是永远起作用的。可是，有些人总感到突出政治落实到思想革命化还“太虚”，说什么落实到思想革命化是看不到，摸不着的。这正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿所散布的“突出政治要落实到业务上”的流毒。
    人的思想革命化必然转化为巨大的物质力量。我一九六一年入伍以后，遵照毛主席和林副主席的教导，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，以毛泽东思想挂帅，在思想革命化上狠下功夫。我逐步懂得：一个人活着为个人最可耻，为人民最有意义。因此，在工作经常变动的情况下，做到一心向着毛主席，紧跟毛主席干革命，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。不管工作千变万变，无产阶级革命战士的本色不变，全心全意为人民服务的思想不变，无限忠于毛主席的红心永远不变。毛主席要我当无线电员，我就以政治统帅业务，积极工作，为创造无限忠于毛主席革命路线的四好连队贡献自己的力量。毛主席指示我到农村去做群众工作，我就以最大的热情向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想。去年春天，响应毛主席的战斗号召，到驻地附近的生产大队去支农，我就和广大贫下中农、革命群众、革命干部一起，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，不管一小撮阶级敌人怎样围攻谩骂、造谣诬蔑，丝毫动摇不了我誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的决心。今年二月，老战士复员，要我去当炊事员，我又愉快地服从了分配，并立志做一个烧火的张思德。所有这些，难道不是思想革命化的成果吗？
    突出无产阶级政治不能落实到业务上，必须落实到人的思想革命化上。这是阶级斗争的需要，是反对修正主义，防止资本主义复辟的需要。几年的实践，使我深刻体会到：千件宝，万件宝，毛泽东思想是宝中宝；千重要，万重要，以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化最重要。
