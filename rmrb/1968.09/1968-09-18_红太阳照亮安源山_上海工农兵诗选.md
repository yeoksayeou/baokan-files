The editorial board: We are extremely excited to recommend to you the poem "The Red Sun Illuminates Anshan Mountain" created by Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers.

A great era produces great art. Amidst the victory songs of the Cultural Revolution, the brilliant revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" was born. In those stirring days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the arch-traitor Liu Shaoqi, created a large number of poems brimming with revolutionary spirit. Today, we publish a selection of these poems. Each of these poems is a magnificent ode to the great leader Chairman Mao, and each is a battle cry against Liu Shaoqi.

The great historical document, "Memorandum of the Conference on Army Literature and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing," points out: "The poems published by workers, peasants, and soldiers on wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, whether in content or form, have marked a completely new era." The poems created by Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers have once again powerfully demonstrated this point. These poems are clear in their love and hate, majestic and heroic, fully displaying the lofty spiritual realm and revolutionary fighting style of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Can those "writers" who look down on workers, peasants, and soldiers, and think themselves great, write such beautiful poems? Can those "poets" who are detached from reality and shut up in their studies, write such fighting songs?

Now the world is entering a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. Workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely and completely be able to become the masters of art.

Ode to Anshan

Worker Author Li Genbao

On Anshan Mountain stands a giant,
The east is about to dawn, thunder rolls;
Chairman Mao waves his hand, the workers' tide rises,
Slaves of the world stand up.

Iron fists strike the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries,
The waves of Peng River surge towards the four seas;
The earth spins, where is it heading?
Look at us workers and peasants controlling the universe!

The Lamp in My Heart Illuminates Ten Thousand Years

And gave the miners a lamp,
In the club, the lamp hangs high,
Under the lamp, the miners form a team.

A towering figure stands on the platform,
Revolutionary truths spread across the four seas,
Under the kerosene lamp, seeds of fire are sown,
The red light of Anshan's path shines brightly—

Rocks in hand become long spears,
The three great mountains must be overturned,
Layer upon layer of coalfields spew flames,
Burning Anshan and the sky red.

And gave the miners a lamp,
In wind and waves, it points the direction,
The lamp in my heart illuminates ten thousand years!

Sunlight shines warmly in the mine.

Chairman Mao personally sows the seeds of revolution,
Revolutionary truths spread across the world,
Workers and peasants unite and charge forward!

Holding the lamp, we talk until dawn,
Rain and dew nourish our hearts,
Slaves of a thousand years want to rise,
Follow the leader Mao Zedong closely.

Longing for the Savior Mao Zedong

Worker Author Shen Yinhong

Coal mountains press heavily on the back, hardships pile up,

The "coal black children" have become the masters!

### 红太阳照亮安源山  上海工农兵诗选

    红太阳照亮安源山
    上海工农兵诗选
    编者的话：我们怀着十分激动的心情，向大家推荐上海工农兵创作的诗歌《红太阳照亮安源山》。
    伟大的时代，产生伟大的艺术。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，光辉夺目的革命油画《毛主席去安源》诞生了。在那激动人心的日子里，上海广大工农兵，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对大工贼、大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，创作了大量充满革命豪情的诗歌。今天本报发表的，就是其中的一部分。这些诗，一首首都是对伟大领袖毛主席的壮丽颂歌，一篇篇都是声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的战斗檄文。
    《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》这个伟大的历史文件指出：“工农兵发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，无论内容和形式都划出了一个完全崭新的时代。”上海工农兵创作的这些诗歌，又一次雄辩地证实了这一点。这些诗，爱憎分明，雄壮豪迈，充分显示了工农兵崇高的精神境界和革命的战斗风格。那些轻视工农兵、自以为了不起的“作家”能写出这样美好的诗篇来吗？那些脱离实际、关在书斋里苦吟的“诗人”能写出这样战斗的乐章来吗？
    现在世界正在进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。由毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，一定要而且也完全有能力成为文艺的主人。
