The current world revolution has entered a great new era. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, and the waves of struggle by the peoples of Western Europe and North America against the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie are rising and surging forward. This year, the workers, students, and black people in the major capitalist countries of the United States, France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, and others have launched one wave of mass struggles after another, dealing heavy blows to the decaying capitalist system and the reactionary ruling cliques of these countries.

Western Europe and North America are the heartland of the capitalist world. The surging movements of the peoples in this region reflect the sharpening of all the fundamental contradictions in contemporary society, especially the sharpening of class contradictions within these countries. This is an important sign of the growing awakening of the peoples of Western Europe and North America, and a prominent manifestation of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of international monopoly capital.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

The masses of the people in Western Europe and North America have already shown their great power in a very clear manner and have demonstrated with their heroic struggles their determination to win final victory. With the support of the peoples of all countries in the world, the peoples of Western Europe and North America will certainly continue to achieve victories and will certainly bury the evil capitalist system.

The New Surge in the American People's Movement

The struggles of black people against violence, workers' strikes, and the progressive student movement have formed three mighty currents, fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule in the United States

This year, in the number one imperialist country, the United States, the struggles of black people against violence, workers' strikes, and the progressive student movement have formed three mighty currents, presenting a picture of surging waves and towering billows.

The struggle of black people in the United States for freedom and liberation, which has been rising higher each year, has become even more fierce and extensive this year. In April, a new storm of struggle against violence triggered by the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King shook the entire United States and the capitalist world. In just ten days, it swept through nearly 170 towns, including the U.S. capital Washington and the major cities of New York and Chicago. Since the summer, cities like Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, and Los Angeles have repeatedly echoed with the gunfire of black people's struggles against violence.

The 20 million black people in the United States, who are subjected to double oppression of class and nation, have, in this year's struggles, openly challenged the reactionary rule of the white monopolistic bourgeoisie with their lives and blood. They set fire to the shops of white exploiters, destroyed the places where the bourgeoisie indulge in pleasure, and turned many cities into battlefields of roaring flames and thick smoke. More and more black people have abandoned "non-violence" and taken to the road of using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. It is worth noting that the imperialist lair of Washington has become the storm center of black people's struggles against violence this year. Black people there have fiercely attacked the ruling clique. They set up blazing fires near the White House, the lair of the U.S. imperialist chief Johnson, frightening the U.S. ruling clique into a state of panic and fear.

The surging black struggle is a prominent manifestation of the deepening political and economic crises currently facing U.S. imperialism, and the inevitable result of the reactionary policies of the U.S. ruling clique to intensify external aggression and expansion and internal oppression and exploitation. The deepening struggle of black people for freedom and liberation not only reflects the growing political awareness and unyielding will to struggle of the black working masses but also serves as a new call to arms for the entire exploited and oppressed people of the United States in their struggle against the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. It heralds the further surge of the people's movement in the United States, including black people.

While the black struggle is surging forward, the workers' strike struggles in the United States for the right to live are also rising. At the beginning of this year, more than 30,000 taxi drivers went on strike; soon after, more than 32,000 glass workers and 90,000 coal miners in 23 states of the United States also went on strike. In April, when the unprecedented scale of black struggle had just begun, more than 200,000 telecommunication workers in 42 states of the United States went on their first nationwide strike in 21 years. The series of workers' strikes, almost without exception, were launched after the workers broke through the numerous obstacles set up by the yellow union leaders and even the reactionary decrees of the U.S. government, fully demonstrating the growing fighting spirit of the American working class.

The progressive student movement in the United States this year has also shown unprecedented momentum and scale. Broad masses of students, in order to oppose the Vietnam War, racial discrimination, political persecution, and demand educational reform, have launched a wave of struggles sweeping the nation, with more than 100 schools experiencing strikes and demonstrations. Some progressive students have also gone deep into factories during the summer vacation to work and fight alongside workers, preparing to push the struggle to new heights.

New Developments in the Mass Struggles in Western Europe

Mass struggles have begun to take a series of militant actions, with the main target being the U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rule of monopoly capital. The student movement has combined with the worker movement to promote the development of the people's struggle.

This year, the struggles of workers and students in the capitalist countries of France, Britain, West Germany, and Italy in Western Europe against the reactionary rule of monopoly capital have surged higher and higher, fully demonstrating the great power of the masses and winning the broad sympathy and support of the revolutionary peoples of all countries in the world. In the people's struggles in these countries, the struggles launched by French workers and students in May are particularly outstanding. The general strike of 10 million workers in various industries swept across all of France. At the same time, tens of thousands of young students took to the streets in major cities like Paris, engaging in continuous, bloody battles with the police, shouting, "Revolution! Revolution!" The struggles of workers and students not only dealt a heavy blow to the French ruling clique but also shook the entire capitalist world, sparking strong reactions among workers and students in many capitalist countries. The strike struggles of British workers this year have also surged to new heights, and the strike struggles of Italian workers in July almost swept across the entire country. The worker masses in West Germany, Spain, and other countries have also launched new struggles. The scale and momentum of the progressive student movements in these countries this year are also unprecedented.

It is particularly worth noting that in the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various Western European countries this year, many new features have emerged. The revolutionary masses in various Western European countries have shown a vigorous and tenacious revolutionary spirit in their struggles. They have broken through the usual methods of mass movements such as sit-ins and petitions and have begun to take a series of militant actions. French workers and students in the summer struggles this year resolutely shouted, "We will use revolutionary violence to counter the violence of the bourgeoisie." Workers and students repeatedly set up barricades in Paris and other major cities in France, singing the "Internationale" and fighting with reactionary police all night long. Recently, French students have continued their struggles, striking at the reactionary ruling clique. In other Western European countries, the struggles of the masses are also very intense. The fierce fighting actions of workers and students in Italy, West Germany, and Spain under the fascist rule of Franco have all dealt heavy blows to the reactionary authorities.

The struggles launched by the revolutionary masses in various Western European countries this year have all clearly targeted the number one enemy of the peoples of the world, U.S. imperialism, and the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie in their own countries. This shows that the level of mass struggles in Western Europe is rapidly rising. Workers and students in many Western European capitalist countries have loudly raised the slogan of opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam in their struggles. The peoples of France, Britain, Italy, West Germany, and other countries have repeatedly organized powerful protests and demonstrations, angrily shouting battle slogans such as "Johnson is a murderer!" and "Down with U.S. imperialism!" The demonstrators in some countries have also angrily burned the U.S. flag and attacked U.S. diplomatic missions. Workers' struggles against the brutal exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and students' demands for the reform of the decaying educational system have also increasingly developed into struggles against the government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies and opening fire on the reactionary ruling cliques in their own countries.

The progressive students in various Western European countries have played a vanguard role in the mass struggles this year and have increasingly combined with the worker movement, which is a very important new development in the people's movements in the capitalist world. The student movement and the worker movement support and inspire each other, powerfully promoting the further surge of the people's movements in various Western European countries. In France, Paris students ignited the flames of revolutionary struggle this summer, and then French workers rose up en masse to launch political and economic general strikes. In the struggles, students marched long distances to factories to support workers' struggles, while workers used powerful strikes to support students' struggles. Italian students participated in large numbers in factory strike picket lines and held rallies with workers to support the struggles of the French people. University students in West Germany also invited workers into schools to hold joint mass meetings against capitalist exploitation. University students in Britain pointed out that the struggle for educational reform by students cannot be separated from the struggle against the government's attacks on the rights of the working class.

    西欧北美群众斗争大风暴
    当前世界革命已进入一个伟大的新时代，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展，西欧、北美各国人民反对垄断资产阶级统治的斗争浪潮此伏彼起，滚滚向前。今年来，美国、法国、英国、西德、意大利等主要资本主义国家的工人、学生以及美国的黑人掀起了一场又一场群众斗争的伟大风暴，沉重地打击了腐朽没落的资本主义制度和这些国家的反动统治集团。
    西欧、北美是资本主义世界的心脏地区，这个地区的人民运动的高涨，反映了当代世界各种基本矛盾的激化，特别是这些国家国内阶级矛盾的激化。这是西欧、北美人民日益觉醒的一个重要标志，也是国际垄断资产阶级反动统治日益不稳的一个突出表现。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    西欧、北美的人民群众已经极其鲜明地显示了他们伟大的力量，并且用英勇斗争的实际行动表明了他们争取最后胜利的决心。在世界各国人民的支持下，西欧、北美人民一定会不断取得胜利，一定会彻底埋葬罪恶的资本主义制度。
    美国人民运动的新高涨
    黑人抗暴斗争，工人罢工斗争以及进步学生运动形成三股巨流，猛烈冲击美国反动统治
    今年来，在头号帝国主义国家美国，黑人群众的抗暴斗争，工人罢工斗争以及进步学生运动形成三股巨流，构成一幅汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的斗争图景。
    一年比一年高涨的美国黑人争取自由解放的斗争，今年来势更加迅猛，规模空前。四月，由于黑人牧师马丁·路德·金遇刺身死而触发的一场抗暴斗争的新风暴，震撼了整个美国和资本主义世界，在短短的十天时间里，就席卷了包括美国首都华盛顿以及纽约、芝加哥等大城市在内的近一百七十个城镇；入夏以来，克利夫兰、芝加哥、底特律、迈阿密、洛杉矶等几十个城市又不断响起了黑人群众抗暴斗争的枪声。
    饱受阶级和民族双重压迫的美国两千万黑人群众，在今年的斗争中以生命和鲜血向白人垄断资产阶级的反动统治展开了公开的挑战。他们放火烧白人剥削者的商店，捣毁资产阶级老爷们寻欢作乐的场所，使许多城市变成了烈火熊熊、硝烟弥漫的战场。越来越多的黑人唾弃了“非暴力主义”，走上了以革命的暴力反对反革命暴力的道路。值得指出的是，美帝的老巢华盛顿成了今年黑人抗暴斗争的风暴中心。黑人群众在那里大造统治集团的反。他们在美帝头子约翰逊的巢穴白宫附近，点起了一处处熊熊烈火，吓得美国统治集团惶惶不安，恐慌万状。
    蓬勃发展的黑人斗争是美帝国主义当前日益深重的政治经济危机的一个突出表现，是美国统治集团变本加厉地推行对外侵略扩张，对内压迫、剥削的反动政策的必然结果。黑人争取自由解放斗争的深入发展不仅反映了黑人劳苦大众的政治觉悟越来越高，斗争的意志越来越坚强，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。它预示着包括黑人在内的美国人民运动的进一步高涨。
    在黑人斗争迅猛发展的同时，美国工人争取生存权利的罢工斗争也不断高涨。今年一开始，就爆发了三万多名出租汽车司机的大罢工；紧接着，美国二十三个州的三万二千多名玻璃工人和九万多名煤矿工人也相继举行了罢工。四月间，当空前规模的黑人斗争刚刚兴起时，美国四十二个州的二十多万电讯工人又举行了二十一年来第一次全国范围的大罢工。工人的一系列罢工斗争，几乎无例外地都是在工人群众突破了黄色工会头头的重重阻挠，甚至冲破了美国政府的反动法令后，开展起来的，充分显示了美国工人阶级日益增强的战斗精神。
    美国进步学生运动今年也出现了前所未有的声势和规模。广大学生为了反对侵越战争，反对种族歧视，反对政治迫害和要求改革教育制度，掀起了一个波及全国的斗争高潮，有一百多所学校爆发了罢课和游行示威。一些进步学生还在暑假中深入到工厂中去，和工人一道劳动，共同战斗，准备把斗争推向新的高潮。
    西欧群众斗争的新发展
    群众斗争开始采取一系列富有战斗性的行动斗争的总矛头直指美帝和垄断资本反动统治学生运动同工人运动结合推动人民斗争发展
    今年，法国、英国、西德、意大利等西欧资本主义国家的工人和学生反对垄断资本反动统治的斗争，也一浪高过一浪，充分显示了人民群众的巨大力量，获得了全世界各国革命人民的广泛同情和支持。在这些国家的人民斗争中，尤其以法国工人和学生在五月间开展的斗争最为突出。法国各行业一千万工人的大罢工，席卷了全法国。与此同时，成千上万的青年学生走上街头，在巴黎等大城市同警察进行连续不断的浴血搏斗，高呼：“革命！革命！”工人和学生的斗争不仅沉重地打击了法国统治集团，而且猛烈地震动了整个资本主义世界，在许多资本主义国家的工人、学生中引起了强烈的反响。英国工人的罢工斗争今年也出现新的高涨，意大利工人今年七月举行的罢工斗争几乎席卷了全国，西德、西班牙等国的工人群众也都展开了新的斗争。而这些国家今年来的进步学生运动，其规模之巨大，来势之猛烈，也都是空前的。
    特别应当指出的是，在西欧各国人民群众的革命斗争中，今年出现了许多新的特点。西欧各国的革命群众在斗争中显示了生气勃勃、英勇顽强的革命气概。他们突破了往常群众运动中静坐、请愿等方式，开始采取了一系列富有战斗性的行动。法国的工人和学生在今年夏天的斗争中，毅然喊出了：“我们要以革命的暴力对付资产阶级的暴力”。工人和学生多次在巴黎和法国其他大城市筑起大批街垒，高唱《国际歌》，同反动军警进行通宵达旦搏斗。最近，法国学生又再接再厉，掀起了新的斗争，打击反动统治集团。在西欧其它国家，群众的斗争也都十分激烈，意大利、西德以及在佛朗哥法西斯统治下的西班牙，工人和学生的激烈的战斗行动，都使反动当局受到沉重的打击。
    西欧各国革命群众今年开展的斗争，其总矛头都明确指向全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义和本国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，这表明西欧群众斗争的水平正在迅速提高。不少西欧资本主义国家的工人和学生在斗争中都响亮地提出了反对美帝国主义侵略越南的口号。法国、英国、意大利、西德等国的人民群众一再组织强大的抗议示威，愤怒高呼“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“打倒美帝国主义！”等战斗口号。一些国家的示威群众还愤怒烧毁美国国旗，袭击美国的驻外机构。工人们反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削，学生们要求改革腐朽教育制度的斗争也正越来越发展成为反对政府反动的内外政策、向本国反动统治集团开火的斗争。
    西欧各国的进步学生在今年的群众斗争中发挥了先锋作用，并且日益同工人运动结合起来，这是资本主义世界人民运动中一个极为重要的新发展。学生运动和工人运动相互支持，相互鼓舞，有力地推动了西欧各国人民运动的进一步高涨。在法国，巴黎学生点燃了今年夏天的革命斗争的怒火，接着，法国工人纷纷起来举行了政治和经济大罢工。在斗争中，学生们长途步行到工厂支援工人的斗争，而工人则用有力的罢工来支持学生的斗争。意大利的学生大规模地参加工厂的罢工纠察队，并且和工人联合举行声援法国人民斗争的集会。西德的大学生也把工人请进学校，联合举行反对资本家剥削的群众大会。英国的大学生指出，学生争取教育改革的斗争，不能同反对政府向工人阶级权利进攻的斗争分开。
