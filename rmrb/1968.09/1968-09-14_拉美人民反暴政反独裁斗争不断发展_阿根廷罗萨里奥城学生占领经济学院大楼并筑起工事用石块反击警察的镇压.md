The struggle of Latin American people against tyranny and dictatorship continues to develop. Students in Rosario, Argentina, occupied the building of the School of Economics and built fortifications to resist the police's suppression with stones.

Students in several cities in Argentina have been holding demonstrations and strikes in recent days to protest against the atrocities committed by the pro-American dictatorship in suppressing the student movement.

On the night of the 12th, about 400 students held a demonstration in the central district of the capital, Buenos Aires. They carried banners and distributed leaflets to protest against the atrocities of the dictatorship. On the same day, students in Cordoba, Rosario, and La Plata held protest strikes, condemning the dictatorship's bloody crime of killing a university student in Cordoba two years ago.

On the night of the 10th, about 1,500 students in Rosario occupied the building of the School of Economics. The students built fortifications and bravely resisted the reactionary police who used tear gas to suppress the students with stones.

On the 7th, students in Cordoba, despite the heavy police guard, took to the streets several times from noon to night to hold demonstrations, protesting against the dictatorship's killing of students. They fought bravely with the police, and another student was shot and injured.

Previously, Argentine students had been fighting since mid-August against the reactionary policies of the pro-American dictatorship and protesting against the dictatorship's suppression of students. Students of the School of Economics in Rosario condemned the U.S. imperialists' infiltration of Argentine universities and the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam at a lightning rally on August 28. Students in La Plata held continuous meetings and strikes in late August to oppose the reactionary student law formulated by the dictatorship.

On the 13th, the New China News Agency reported from Santiago that the workers of the Beca shoe factory in Chile began a strike on the 10th to demand an increase in wages, which had spread to all branches of the factory by the 12th, with more than 4,000 workers participating in the strike.

On the same day, about 200 transportation workers in Valparaiso, Chile's main port, also went on strike to demand an increase in wages.

More than 100 workers in the Baranquillas district government of the Chilean capital, Santiago, went on strike again on the 10th after an August strike to demand that the authorities pay the August wages that were in arrears.

Agricultural workers in the southern province of Nuble, Chile, have been fighting continuously due to the threat of unemployment. Recently, some unemployed agricultural workers have formed a "unemployed" group to prepare for the struggle. The government authorities are terrified and have strengthened their defenses.

In recent years, due to the intensification of U.S. imperialist infiltration and plunder of Chile, the country's economic situation has become worse and worse, with currency devaluation and rapid price increases. On September 11, the Chilean currency, the escudo, devalued again, marking the 17th devaluation this year; prices in Chile have risen by 23% in the first eight months of this year. As a result, the living conditions of the Chilean people are becoming more and more difficult, and the number of unemployed is increasing day by day. It is reported that the current number of unemployed in Chile has reached more than 300,000. Under these circumstances, the working people have been fighting for their right to survive. By the end of August this year, Chile had seen 2,539 strikes, with 174,000 participants.

    近年来，由于美帝国主义加紧对智利的渗透和掠夺，智利的经济情况越来越糟，货币不断贬值，物价急剧上涨。九月十一日，智利货币埃斯库多又一次贬值，这是智利货币今年来第十七次贬值；今年头八个月智利物价已上涨了百分之二十三。这样一来，智利人民生活愈来愈贫困，失业人数一天天增多。据报道，目前智利失业人数已达三十万人之多。在这种情况下，劳动人民纷纷起来为争取生存权利而斗争。到今年八月止，智利已发生了二千五百三十九次罢工，参加罢工人数达十七万四千人次。
