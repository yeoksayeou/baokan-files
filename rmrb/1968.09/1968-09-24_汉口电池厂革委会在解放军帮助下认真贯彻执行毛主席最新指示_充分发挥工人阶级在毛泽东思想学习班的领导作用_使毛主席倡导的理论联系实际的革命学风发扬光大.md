The Hankou Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the PLA, earnestly implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully plays the leading role of the working class in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promotes the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao of combining theory with practice.

Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with workers as the main body, allow workers to directly participate in leadership, fully exerting the exemplary role of the working class in learning and applying theory consistently, and in speaking and acting consistently, to re-educate intellectuals, and solve the "old difficult" problems, bringing about a new situation in the factory's revolution and production.

The Hankou Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory, relies on the worker masses to fully implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, further implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, ensuring the continuous development of the factory's revolution and production, and the situation is getting better and better.

Recently, the Hankou Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully exerted. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." They further realized that only by fully exerting the leading role of the working class in all work can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be fully implemented, and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be achieved.

After the Hankou Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee was established in December last year, it took the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the establishment of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as its primary task.

When the Hankou Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, it allowed workers to directly participate in the leadership of the study classes and take charge of formulating study plans. During the study process, the worker masses seriously grasped the active thoughts of the study class members, conducted detailed ideological and political work, and ensured that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were fully implemented. These workers, especially the old workers, had the deepest understanding and most active application of Mao Zedong Thought. They spoke vividly and practically, both in words and deeds, and were very convincing. They were the strongest leaders and the most outstanding teachers of the study classes. Some time ago, the factory, in order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, followed the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers, and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Participants included old workers, worker technicians, and technical personnel with student backgrounds. In the study class, old workers actively organized and guided everyone to deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With deep proletarian feelings, they carried out heart-to-heart talks with technical personnel with student backgrounds, using their own experiences to educate young technical personnel, and together exposed and criticized the crimes of the factory's bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line. Old workers used ironclad facts to expose the true colors of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities." Through revolutionary criticism, workers proposed effective plans to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions: first, to organize technical personnel with student backgrounds to work in the workshops in a planned manner; second, to fully exert the role of worker technicians; third, to cultivate and promote technical personnel from workers; fourth, to organize a three-in-one technical team. This plan was approved by the broad revolutionary staff.

After achieving revolutionary unity and establishing the revolutionary committee, the factory was still influenced by the bourgeois reactionary "multi-center" trend of thought in society, and there were still remnants of factionalism and small groupism. Some people, poisoned by the reactionary "multi-center" theory, had hot heads and were full of bourgeois factionalism. They formed small groups, seriously alienated from the workers, and from the majority of the masses, obstructing the further consolidation and development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. They talked big but acted differently. They shouted "unconditionally obey" when Chairman Mao's latest instructions were to their advantage, but ignored them when they were not. Although such people were few in number, they had great influence and caused great obstacles in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making some "old difficult" problems unsolvable.

The factory revolutionary committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team held a special Mao Zedong Thought study class to mobilize the broad masses of workers to launch a revolutionary criticism of the bourgeois reactionary "multi-center" theory. In the study class, old worker and deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee Zhao Xijian, with his own experiences, criticized the harm that the reactionary "multi-center" theory and bourgeois bad learning style had brought to the factory's revolution and production, greatly educating the members of the study class. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and under the leadership of the working class, the broad masses, with Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, eliminated the poison of the reactionary "multi-center" theory, removed the obstacles to the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and finally solved some "old difficult" problems.

The factory revolutionary committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team actively advocated and commended the revolutionary learning style of learning and applying consistently, and guiding the broad staff to establish the idea of "learning and applying is honorable, learning and not applying is shameful." The factory revolutionary committee attached great importance to summarizing the experiences of worker masses in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, establishing advanced examples of learning and applying consistently, commending good deeds of learning and applying, and further promoting the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. In January this year, the class enemy stirred up a reactionary anarchist trend of thought and counter-revolutionary economism, and the factory once showed signs of lax discipline. Some people, for personal gain, put forward some unreasonable demands to the revolutionary committee. The factory revolutionary committee promptly held a study class centered on criticizing anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism, organizing old workers to expose the crimes of anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism, and to dig out the roots of anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism, inspiring and guiding the masses to fully implement Chairman Mao's instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production," and "save money to make revolution," quickly launching a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, with a labor attendance rate of over 95%, and the revolution and production entering a new situation.

    汉口电池厂革委会在解放军帮助下认真贯彻执行毛主席最新指示
    充分发挥工人阶级在毛泽东思想学习班的领导作用  使毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风发扬光大
    各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，都以工人为主体，让工人直接参加领导，充分发挥工人阶级学用一致，言行一致的表率作用，对知识分子进行再教育，解决了“老大难”问题，全厂革命和生产出现新局面
    本报讯　汉口电池厂革命委员会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚持依靠工人群众，使毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风在全厂大发扬，进一步落实了毛主席的一系列最新指示，保证了全厂革命和生产不断发展，形势越来越好。
    最近，汉口电池厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”进一步认识到，只有在一切工作中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，才能保证毛主席的最新指示全面落实，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    汉口电池厂革命委员会在去年十二月成立以后，就把活学活用毛泽东思想，大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，作为革委会的首要任务。
    汉口电池厂革命委员会在举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班的时候，都让工人直接参加学习班的领导，担任学习组长，负责制定学习计划。在学习过程中，工人群众认真抓学习班成员的活思想，进行细致的思想政治工作，保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实。这些工人特别是老工人，对毛泽东思想领会最深，用得最活，他们讲得生动，用得实在，既能言教，又能身教，很有说服力。他们是学习班最坚强的领导，最优秀的教师。前些时候，厂里为了落实毛主席最新指示，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习的有老工人、工人技术员和学生出身的技术人员。在学习班上，老工人积极组织和引导大家深刻领会毛主席的最新指示。他们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，同学生出身的技术人员开展谈心活动，用自己的切身体会教育青年技术人员，和他们一道揭发批判厂里资产阶级反动技术“权威”推行反革命修正主义科技路线的罪行。老工人用一桩桩铁的事实，戳穿了资产阶级反动技术“权威”的画皮。通过革命大批判，工人们又提出了落实毛主席最新指示的行之有效的方案：一、有计划地组织学生出身的技术人员到车间劳动；二、充分发挥工人技术员的作用；三、从工人中培养和提拔技术人员；四、组织三结合的技术队伍。这个方案得到广大革命职工的赞同。
    这个厂在实现革命大联合、成立革命委员会之后，由于受社会上资产阶级反动的“多中心论”思潮的影响，仍然存在着山头主义、小团体主义的残余。有的人，由于中了反动的“多中心论”的毒，头脑发热，资产阶级派性十足，老虎屁股摸不得。他们结成小团体，严重脱离工人，脱离群众大多数，阻碍着革命大联合和革命三结合的进一步巩固和发展。他们嘴里讲得呱呱叫，行动却是另一套。毛主席的最新指示，对他们有利的，他们就喊“坚决照办”，对他们不利的，就置若罔闻。这种人虽然为数不多，但能量很大，影响很坏，在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中产生很大阻力，使一些“老大难”问题不能得到解决。
    厂革命委员会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，为此举办了专题毛泽东思想学习班，发动广大工人群众对资产阶级反动的“多中心论”开展了革命大批判。在学习班上，老工人、厂革委会副主任赵锡鉴以自己的切身体会，批判了反动的“多中心论”和资产阶级的坏学风对本厂革命和生产带来的危害，使学习班成员受到很大的教育。在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，在工人阶级的领导下，广大群众以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，清除了反动的“多中心论”的流毒，搬掉了巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合的障碍，终于把一些“老大难”问题解决了。
    厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队积极提倡和表扬学用一致、言行一致的革命学风，引导广大职工树立“学了就用为荣，学了不用为耻”的观念。厂革委会很重视总结工人群众活学活用毛主席最新指示的经验，树立学用一致的先进典型，表扬学了就用的好人好事，使毛主席倡导的革命好学风更加发扬光大。今年一月，阶级敌人刮起了一股无政府主义反动思潮和反革命经济主义妖风，厂里一度出现了纪律松弛的现象。有的人为了个人利益向革委会提出了一些不合理的要求。厂革委会及时举办了以批判无政府主义、反革命经济主义为中心内容的学习班，组织老工人大摆无政府主义和反革命经济主义的罪状，大挖无政府主义和反革命经济主义的毒根，启发和引导群众全面落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”，“要节约闹革命”的指示，全厂很快掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮，劳动出勤率达到百分之九十五以上，革命和生产出现了新局面。
