Uruguayan workers' struggle against exploitation and oppression continues to develop. Public transportation drivers in the capital, Montevideo, began a 48-hour strike on the 15th, demanding wage increases. After some transportation companies' drivers went on strike, employees of Uruguay's largest transportation company, Onda, also joined the strike in solidarity.

The crew of Chile's coastal merchant fleet went on a nationwide strike in early September to protest the unreasonable wage system stipulated in the recently signed labor-management contract. Their strike was supported by coastal seamen.

New China News Agency, September 18th: Workers in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, continue their just struggle against the unreasonable closure of factories and layoffs by monopolistic capital. Over a thousand workers in Montevideo continued to occupy the state-owned slaughterhouse and cold storage plant on the 17th. They have been occupying the factory since the night of the 12th to protest the factory's unreasonable closure and the layoff of 2,600 workers. The workers' just actions have received the support of students.

New China News Agency, September 16th: La Paz News: University students and teachers in Cochabamba, Bolivia, held a demonstration on the 14th to protest against the reactionary rule of the pro-American dictatorship.
