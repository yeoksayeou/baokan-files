The red vitriol production workshop of Shenyang City's New City Chemical Factory has a large converter that has undergone reconstruction. In the process of reconstructing the large converter, the workers underwent a severe test of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines. With their hearts filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, they overcame the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, demonstrating the great power of the working class!

In the spring of 1961, after using the homemade furnace equipment, the red vitriol production workshop installed a large converter. At that time, the workers saw such new equipment and thought that in the future they could produce more and better industrial raw materials for the country, and their hearts were filled with joy. However, after it was put into production, it was found that there were serious problems with the chromium and water immersion processes. Not only did the production indicators not go up, but many people also suffered from chromium poisoning and could not continue working. The workers demanded that measures be taken immediately to improve the process and to boost production. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" in the Shenyang Chemical Bureau and the factory ignored the workers' voices and did not solve the problem.

After the workers' struggle, the bureau was forced to send a technical "authority" to the factory in February 1963. This "authority" was indeed impressive, bringing a large amount of technical materials and several assistants. After entering the factory, they did not go deep into the scene nor listen to the workers' opinions, but instead closed the door to formulate the converter reconstruction plan. After a long time, based on the so-called "advanced" technology materials from Europe, America, and the Soviet revisionists, they finally came up with a plan. This was a plan that was detached from reality, and just to reconstruct six water immersion tanks, it would take more than half a year, requiring more than thirty tons of steel and more than fifty thousand yuan in funds. According to this plan, they worked for two years, wasting more than eighty thousand yuan and a large amount of manpower and resources, but not a single water immersion tank was built.

A thunderous roar shook the heavens. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all the revolutionary workers of the factory, who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, rebelled against the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," and seized back all the powers they had usurped.

In this struggle, all the revolutionary workers of the factory received a class education and strengthened their sense of political responsibility as the leading class. In June of this year, the workers decided to thoroughly solve the "old and difficult" problem that the reactionary technical "authorities" thought workers could not solve.

The workers spoke and acted. They immediately started to solve the problem of reconstructing the chromium transportation and water immersion tanks. They did not know how to draw blueprints, so they actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify their understanding and guide their actions. After several days of repeated deliberation, everyone contributed their ideas, and a quick, efficient, and economical reconstruction plan was quickly formulated. Then, they devoted all their efforts to the reconstruction project. However, the six water immersion tanks were all buried underground, each weighing four tons, and they had to be hoisted up one by one without a crane. How to do it? At this time, the group leader of the converter group mobilized everyone to think of ways, using jacks and winches, and within two days, they broke through this difficulty. At this time, all the workers in the workshop actively cooperated. There were not enough workers, so they learned from the skilled workers and did the work of fitters, carpenters, scaffolders, and crane operators themselves; there was a lack of materials, so they practiced self-reliance, using old materials to replace new ones, and utilizing waste materials; to save time, they worked day and night. In this way, they used only twenty-five days and spent more than three thousand yuan to fundamentally solve a technical difficulty that had not been solved for many years. After it was put into production, the work efficiency was increased by about thirty percent, but the number of workers per shift was reduced by nearly half compared to the past. This incident greatly boosted the morale of the working class, greatly dampened the arrogance of the class enemies, and gave the reactionary technical "authorities" a resounding slap in the face!

The workers' creation further proved that Chairman Mao's great teaching that "without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed" is an unshakable truth. The facts vividly tell us: the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has the highest consciousness, the reddest hearts, the most loyalty to Chairman Mao, the closest following of Chairman Mao, and the most resolute execution of the instructions of the proletarian headquarters. They not only can lead the great revolution in political and ideological fields but also can lead the great revolution in production and technology. They are indeed the most conscious leading class of our 700 million people!

    大转炉改建记
    沈阳市新城化工厂红矾生产车间，有一台经过改建的大转炉。在改建大转炉的过程中，工人们经历了两个阶级、两条路线斗争的严峻考验，他们以自己一颗颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，战胜了资产阶级反动技术“权威”，显示了工人阶级的伟大力量！
    一九六一年春天，红矾生产车间继用土炉生产设备之后，又安装了一台大转炉。那时，工人们看到这样的新设备，觉得今后能给国家生产出更多更好的工业原料，心里都很高兴。可是投产后，却发现出铬料和水浸工序存在着严重问题。不仅生产指标上不去，而且不少人还因为中了铬毒而不能坚持工作。工人们要求迅速采取措施，改进工序，好把生产突击上去。但是沈阳市化工局和厂里的一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”，竟不顾工人们的呼声，就是不给解决。
    经过工人们的斗争，局里被迫在一九六三年二月派技术“权威”来厂了。这个“权威”真是够“气派”，随身带来了大量技术资料，还带来不少助手。他们进厂后，既不深入现场，又不听取工人的意见，就关起门来制定转炉改建方案。费了好长时间，根据欧美和苏修的所谓“先进”技术资料，总算把方案制定出来了。这是一个脱离实际的庞大的方案，仅改建六个水浸槽，就需要半年多时间，要用三十多吨钢材，五万多元经费。按照这个方案一连干了两年，白白花了八万多元，浪费了大量人力物力，却连一个水浸槽也未建成。
    霹雳一声震天响。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无限忠于毛主席的全厂革命工人，造了走资派和反动技术“权威”的反，夺回了被他们窃取的一切大权。
    在这场斗争中，全厂革命职工都受到一次阶级教育，增强了领导阶级的政治责任感。今年六月，工人们决心把反动技术“权威”认为工人不能解决的“老大难”问题，来个彻底解决。
    工人们说到做到。他们当即就着手解决改建运铬料和水浸槽的问题。他们不会画图纸，就活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统一自己的认识，指挥自己的行动。经过几天反复琢磨，大家献计献策，一个多快好省的改建方案很快研究出来了。接着，他们全力以赴，投入了改建工程。可是六个水浸槽都埋在地下，每个四吨重，要把它一个个吊上来，没有起重机，怎么办？这时转炉组组长便发动大家动脑筋想办法，又用千斤顶，又用绞磨拉，仅用两天工夫就把这个难关突破了。这时，全车间工人都主动协作。工种不够，他们就以能者为师，自己干起了钳工、木瓦工、架子工、起重工；缺乏材料，他们就发扬自力更生的精神，以旧代新，利用废品；为争取时间，他们日夜奋战。就这样，他们只用了二十五天时间，花了三千多元，就把一个多年没有解决的技术难关，从根本上解决了。投产后，提高工效百分之三十左右，每班工人却比过去减少将近一半。这件事，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，给了反动技术“权威”一记响亮的耳光！
    工人们这个创举，进一步证明了毛主席“没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了”这一伟大教导，是颠扑不破的真理。事实生动地告诉我们：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，觉悟最高，心最红，对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席最紧，对无产阶级司令部的指示执行最坚决。他们不但能领导好政治思想上的大革命，而且也能够领导好生产和技术上的大革命。他们不愧为我国七亿人口的最有觉悟的领导阶级！　　　　　　　　　　（沈勤支）
