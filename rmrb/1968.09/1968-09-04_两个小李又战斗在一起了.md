The Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at the East China Textile Institute, and among the students of Class 632 in the Textile Chemistry Department, a lively story has been circulating.

There are two students named Li in the class, one is Li Zehong, and the other is Li Suixia. Both had previously held positions in the Communist Youth League, shared a dormitory, and came from working-class families. They had no secrets from each other. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, they braved the wind and snow to walk to Yan'an together. During the days of white terror under the bourgeois reactionary line, they together stormed the old Shanghai Municipal Committee. Later, they joined different mass organizations with differing viewpoints. Under the influence of bourgeois factionalism, they forgot their past comradeship. When they argued, neither would yield. They no longer wanted to live together and both moved out of their original dormitory.

This time, when the workers' propaganda team entered the Class 632 classroom, they set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing the students to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations must achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they must achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles," and "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." During the study, the worker comrades took the lead in speaking, recalling and comparing, linking their thoughts to their own factory's reality, and enumerating the harm of bourgeois factionalism. After hearing the old workers talk about their past hardships of "no books to read, no food to eat, and no clothes to wear," Li Zehong and Li Suixia were deeply moved. They thought of how the working people used their blood and sweat to support themselves, and how the revolutionary martyrs used their blood to bring about today's happiness, but they did not listen to Chairman Mao's words and did not act according to Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, creating bourgeois factionalism. How could they face Chairman Mao? They felt more and more ashamed.

They shed tears of remorse in the study class, each checking their own shortcomings, expressing their desire to eliminate prejudices and join hands to unite against the enemy. Recently, they moved back into the same dormitory. They chat and laugh together, write big-character posters together, and fight side by side.

    两个小李又战斗在一起了
    上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队来到华东纺织工学院以后，纺化系六三二班同学中间传诵着这样一个生动的故事。
    班上有两个小李，一个叫李泽红，一个叫李绥霞。她们过去都担任共青团的工作，同住一个寝室，又都是劳动人民家庭出身，平时无话不谈。文化大革命初期，她们曾经冒着风雪和严寒，一道徒步去延安串连。在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖的日子里，她们一起冲击旧上海市委。后来，各自参加了不同观点的群众组织。由于受到资产阶级派性的影响，把过去的战斗友谊忘得一干二净。两人争论起来互不相让。她们再也不愿住在一起，都搬出了原来的寝室。
    这次工人宣传队踏进六三二班教室后，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，组织同学学习毛主席的教导：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”，“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”学习时，工人同志带头发言，回忆对比，联系自己的思想，联系自己厂里的实际，历数资产阶级派性的危害性。李泽红和李绥霞听了老工人谈到他们过去“没书读，没饭吃，没衣穿”的被压迫被剥削的苦难生活后，很受感动，想到劳动人民用血汗养活自己，革命先烈用鲜血换来了今天的幸福生活，而自己却不听毛主席的话，不按毛主席的战略部署办事，闹资产阶级派性，这怎么对得起毛主席呢，她们越想越感到惭愧。
    她们含着热泪在学习班上各自检查了自己的缺点，表示要消除成见，携起手来，团结对敌。最近，她俩又搬到一个寝室里住了。两人有说有笑，一起写大批判文章，共同战斗。
