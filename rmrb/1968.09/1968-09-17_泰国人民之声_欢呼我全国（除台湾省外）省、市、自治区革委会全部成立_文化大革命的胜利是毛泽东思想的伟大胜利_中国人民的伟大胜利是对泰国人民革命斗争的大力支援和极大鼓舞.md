The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 13th, enthusiastically congratulating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China (except Taiwan Province).

The article pointed out that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China (except Taiwan Province) is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for Chairman Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. All revolutionary people around the world feel elated and enthusiastically celebrate this great victory.

The article pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese and world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has profound historical significance. The article said, Chairman Mao Zedong systematically summarized the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, especially the experience and lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries. He scientifically analyzed the contradictions in socialist society, deeply pointed out the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and proposed a set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and measures for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In theory and practice, he solved a series of major issues such as how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism in countries where the proletariat has already seized power. This is Chairman Mao Zedong's great contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage.

The article pointed out that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China (except Taiwan Province) thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the revisionist clique, represented by China's Khrushchev, to restore capitalism in China. This is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries. Their dream of achieving "peaceful evolution" in China has completely failed.

The article said, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, which takes Mao Zedong Thought as the revolutionary beacon, the Thai people are greatly inspired by the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The revolutionary people of Thailand regard this great victory of the Chinese people as their own victory, as a great support for the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people, and as a great encouragement for the patriotic democratic struggle of the Thai people against American aggression and to overthrow the traitorous regime of Thanom-Babbo. The Thai people extend revolutionary greetings to the great Chinese people and warmly congratulate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They wish the great Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, even greater victories.

    文化大革命的胜利是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利

    新华社十五日讯“泰国人民之声”电台十三日广播一篇文章，热烈祝贺我国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立革命委员会。
    文章指出，革命委员会在中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。全世界革命人民都感到欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼这个伟大胜利。
    文章指出，由中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，具有深远的历史意义。文章说，毛泽东主席系统地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是总结了在苏联以及某些其它社会主义国家资本主义复辟的经验教训，科学地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾，深刻地指出社会主义社会的阶级斗争规律，提出了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的一整套理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。在理论和实践上解决了在无产阶级已经掌握政权的国家中，如何巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟等一系列重大问题。这是毛泽东主席天才地、创造性地把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新阶段的伟大贡献。
    文章指出，中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会的全部成立，彻底粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义集团妄图在中国复辟资本主义的反革命阴谋。这是对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的沉重打击。它们要在中国实现“和平演变”的幻想已彻底破产。
    文章说，在以毛泽东思想为革命指针的泰国共产党英明领导下的泰国人民，对中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利，感到无比振奋。泰国革命人民把中国人民的这一伟大胜利看作是自己的胜利，是对泰国人民的革命斗争的大力支援，是对泰国人民反对美帝侵略、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的爱国民主斗争的极大鼓舞。泰国人民向伟大的中国人民致以革命的敬礼，热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，并祝愿伟大的中国人民在毛泽东主席的英明领导下取得更加伟大的胜利。
