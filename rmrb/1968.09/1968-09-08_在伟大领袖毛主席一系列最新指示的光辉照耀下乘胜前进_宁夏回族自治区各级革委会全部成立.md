	Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been fully established. The working class in Ningxia has played a leading role in consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees at all levels. Currently, under the leadership of the working class, a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation has swept across the entire region.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Yinchuan, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the warm care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, all prefectures, counties, and cities in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have established revolutionary committees. Ninety-two percent of factories and enterprises and ninety percent of rural people's communes have also established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire region is excellent and continues to improve.

	The newly established revolutionary committees at all levels are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, leading the broad masses of revolutionary people of the Hui and Han nationalities to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. They are launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary criticism has promoted the ideological transformation of the people, driving the development of production. Industrial production in the region is continuously increasing, summer crops have yielded good results, and autumn crops are growing well, with a bumper harvest in sight. Currently, the entire region is launching a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work." Under the leadership of the autonomous region's revolutionary committee and with the support and assistance of the PLA's leftist troops, the working class in Ningxia is following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and playing a leading role in consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees at all levels and in promoting the excellent situation. This is an important reason for the rapid development of the revolutionary situation in Ningxia.

	The working class in Ningxia has established Mao Zedong Thought study classes in factories, mines, construction sites, dormitories, and homes. Revolutionary workers in these classes are actively carrying out the "three loyalties" campaign: loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and are fighting against selfishness to continuously raise their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. Under the leadership of the working class, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have spread throughout the cities and countryside, becoming more numerous and better organized, with over 900,000 participants.

	Recently, revolutionary workers have launched a mass criticism of the reactionary bourgeois "multiple centers mean no center" theory. Through the criticism of this reactionary bourgeois theory, under the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary masses in various factories, mines, offices, and schools in Ningxia have further realized revolutionary great unity according to systems, industries, and classes. The entire region presents a scene of unprecedented unity under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters.

	The working class harbors the deepest hatred for class enemies and the deepest love for the newly established revolutionary committees. In mid-April, shortly after the establishment of the autonomous region's revolutionary committee, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, launched a fierce counterattack, attempting to strangle the newly born revolutionary committee. In the face of this serious class struggle, revolutionary workers from the Fifth Engineering Division of the Eighth Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, Yinchuan Rubber Factory, Yinchuan Factory 109, Yinchuan Machine Repair Factory, and Yinchuan Cotton Mill, among others, stood out first, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, exposing the plots of a handful of spies, traitors, and unrepentant capitalist roaders to overthrow the revolutionary committee. Under the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary masses across the region launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, exposing one hidden class enemy after another.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The working class in Ningxia loves the People's Liberation Army the most and firmly supports it. They have launched extensive activities to support the army, seriously learning from the PLA's good experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, learning from the PLA's tradition of upholding the four firsts and carrying forward the three-eight spirit, and forming a deep bond with the PLA.

	After Chairman Mao recently issued the latest instruction that "to achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership from the working class and participation from the working masses," under the leadership of the autonomous region's revolutionary committee, the first batch of 71 worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the entire region have marched into schools and some "difficult" units. Under the leadership of the working class, a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation has risen in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下乘胜前进
    宁夏回族自治区各级革委会全部成立
    宁夏工人阶级在巩固和发展各级革命委员会的斗争中，很好地发挥了领导作用。目前，在工人阶级的领导下，一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮已经在全区兴起
    据新华社银川五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，宁夏回族自治区所有的专区、县、市全部成立了革命委员会，百分之九十二的工厂企业和百分之九十的农村人民公社也成立了革命委员会，全区革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    新生的各级革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，率领广大回汉族革命群众，活学活用毛泽东思想，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。革命大批判促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展。全区工业生产不断增长，农业夏季作物获得了良好收成，秋季作物长势良好，丰收在望。现在，全区上下正在掀起一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”宁夏工人阶级在自治区革命委员会的领导下，在人民解放军支左部队的支持、帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在巩固和发展各级革命委员会的斗争中，在发展大好形势的斗争中，很好地发挥了领导作用。这是当前宁夏地区革命形势迅猛发展的重要原因。
    宁夏工人阶级在工厂、矿山、工地、宿舍、家庭，大办毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命职工在学习班里，积极开展无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，狠斗私心，不断提高自己的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。在工人阶级的带动下，全区毛泽东思想学习班遍及城乡，越办越多，越办越好，参加学习的达九十多万人次。
    最近，广大革命工人，对反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”展开了群众性的大批判。通过对反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”的批判，在工人阶级带动下，宁夏各厂矿、机关、学校革命群众最近进一步按照系统、按照行业、按照班级实现革命大联合，全区呈现出在无产阶级司令部统一号令下空前团结的大好局面。
    工人阶级对阶级敌人最仇恨，对新生的革命委员会最热爱。今年四月中旬，自治区革命委员会刚刚诞生，不甘心失败的一小撮阶级敌人就进行猖狂反扑，妄图扼杀新生的革命委员会。在这严重的阶级斗争面前，建筑工程部八局一公司第五工程处、银川橡胶厂、银川一○九厂、银川机械修配厂、银川棉纺厂等单位的革命工人，首先挺身而出，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，揭露了一小撮特务、叛徒和死不悔改的走资派等反革命分子妄图颠覆革命委员会的阴谋。在工人阶级的带动下，全区革命群众向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，揪出了一个个暗藏的阶级敌人。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”宁夏工人阶级最热爱人民解放军，最拥护人民解放军，坚定不移地相信和依靠人民解放军。他们广泛开展拥军活动，认真学习人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验，学习人民解放军坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风的优良传统，和人民解放军结下了鱼水深情。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近发出“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示以后，在自治区革委会的领导下，全区第一批七十一个工人毛泽东思想宣传队，昂首阔步地开进了学校和一些“老大难”单位。在工人阶级的领导下，一个伟大的斗、批、改革命高潮已经在宁夏回族自治区兴起。
