Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class in Shaanxi Province is fully exerting its leading role, vigorously promoting revolution and production. The industrial front is in full swing with class struggle, criticism, and reform, and production is flourishing. The province's total industrial output has been growing at a high speed since the third quarter. July's output was nearly double the monthly average of the first half of the year, August's output increased by 14.38% compared to July, and since September, the production situation on the industrial front has been even better, with output continuing to rise steadily.

The excellent situation on Shaanxi's industrial front is the result of the working class remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle." They adhere to the line of class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle, using revolution to guide production. After the establishment of the Shaanxi Revolutionary Committee, the province's workers, under the leadership of the provincial and local revolutionary committees and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, along with the revolutionary masses throughout the province, have been deeply and persistently engaged in revolutionary criticism. Many factories, mines, and construction sites have linked the class enemies they have already exposed with the Chinese Khrushchev, conducting extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle, which has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the workers in Shaanxi to seize the revolution and promote production. They say: the working class leads everything, relying on Mao Zedong Thought. They put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in various industrial and mining enterprises has reached a new high. The revolutionary workers of the Weibei Coal Mine have turned pre-shift and post-shift meetings into study and application sessions of Mao Zedong Thought, with everyone reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to examine their thoughts and actions. This has effectively promoted the thought revolution of the people, bringing about a great situation of daily and monthly improvements in production. In July, coal production increased by more than 50% compared to June, and in August and September, it increased significantly compared to July, continuously creating the highest daily production records in the history of this coal mine, becoming a red flag for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the province. The revolutionary workers of Xi'an Diesel Engine Factory, Northwest Cotton Mill No. 8, and Xingping Glass Fiber Factory, among other factories and enterprises, have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learning a little and using a little, making the revolution hot and fiery, and production rising month by month.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "implementing the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the working class," the working class in large and medium-sized cities such as Xi'an, Baoji, and Tongchuan in Shaanxi Province responded swiftly and decisively, quickly selecting their outstanding representatives to form the first batch of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, they marched into 77 large and medium-sized schools, cultural, medical, and scientific research units, and onto the stage of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure. The workers who remained in the factories exerted tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm, shouldering the dual responsibilities of seizing the revolution and promoting production, and production continued to rise.

On the industrial front of Shaanxi Province, during the high tide of class struggle, criticism, and reform, the wave of technological innovation and technological revolution is surging. The Baoji Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory has manufactured the first domestically designed and manufactured gear grinding machine in China, whose precision and efficiency have surpassed international standards. The Xi'an High Voltage Electromagnetic Factory has successfully developed the first zinc-plating equipment in China with international standards, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times. The revolutionary workers of the Shaanxi Machine Tool Factory have developed a new type of printing machine, increasing work efficiency by more than five times. The revolutionary workers of the Xi'an Xin Hua Rubber Factory have successfully developed an engraving machine, increasing work efficiency by three times. The revolutionary workers of the Weiyang Diesel Engine Factory have successfully changed from mechanical processing of connecting rod shapes to electrolysis processing, increasing work efficiency by 24 times.

    工人阶级充分发挥领导作用  革命轰轰烈烈生产蒸蒸日上
    陕西省工业总产值高速度增长
    在斗批改高潮中，技术革新和技术革命正在兴起
    据新华社西安二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，陕西省的工人阶级充分发挥领导作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，工业战线斗、批、改搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。全省工业总产值，进入第三季度以来，高速度增长。七月份比上半年月平均数猛增近一倍，八月份比七月份又增长百分之十四点三八，九月份以来，全省工业战线上的生产形势更好，产量继续稳步上升。
    陕西工业战线上的大好形势，是全省工人阶级牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚持以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，用革命统帅生产的丰硕成果。陕西省革命委员会成立后，全省广大工人在省革委会和各级革委会的带领下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，和全省广大革命群众一道，深入持久地开展革命大批判。许多工厂、矿山、工地的革命职工，把已揪出的阶级敌人和中国赫鲁晓夫挂上钩，狠狠地进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，极大地激发了革命职工昂扬的革命斗志。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了陕西广大工人群众抓革命促生产的积极性。他们说：工人阶级领导一切，靠的是毛泽东思想。他们把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，各工矿企业活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新的高潮。渭北煤矿的革命职工，把班前会、班后会变成活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，用毛主席的一系列最新指示，检验自己的思想和行动，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，带来了生产日新月异的大好局面，七月份煤炭生产比六月份提高百分之五十以上，八、九月又比七月大幅度增长，连续创造了这个煤矿历史上从来没有过的日产最高纪录，成为全省抓革命促生产的一面红旗。西安柴油机厂、西北国棉八厂、兴平玻璃纤维厂等一批工厂企业的革命职工，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，学一点，用一点，革命搞得热火朝天，生产逐月大幅度上升。
    毛主席“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示发出后，陕西省西安、宝鸡、铜川等大中城市的工人阶级闻风而动，雷厉风行，迅速选派自己的优秀代表，组成了第一批工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在省、市革委会领导下，浩浩荡荡地开进了七十七个大中学校、文艺、医疗、科研等单位，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台。留厂的工人发挥了冲天的革命干劲，肩负抓革命促生产两副重担，生产仍然持续上升。
    陕西省工业战线在斗、批、改高潮中，技术革新和技术革命的热潮正在蓬勃兴起。宝鸡秦川机床厂，制成了我国第一台自己设计自己制造的一种齿轮磨床，其精度、效能都超过了国际水平。西安高压电磁厂试制成功了具有国际水平的我国第一座镀锌设备，提高工效十倍以上。陕西省机床厂的革命职工，试制出一种新型印刷机，提高工效五倍多。西安新华橡胶厂的革命职工试制成功一种刻花机，提高了工效三倍。渭阳柴油机厂的革命职工，由机械加工连杆外形试改成电解加工成功，提高了工效二十四倍。
