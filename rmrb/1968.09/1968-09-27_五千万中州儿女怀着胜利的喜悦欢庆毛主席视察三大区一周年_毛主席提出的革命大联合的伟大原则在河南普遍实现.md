The Taihang Mountains smile, and the Yellow River laughs. On this joyous day marking the first anniversary of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the 50 million Zhongzhou people, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, look back on the past year of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have continuously implemented Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "achieve great unity in revolution under the principle of revolution." In Henan Province, the great principle of revolutionary unity has been widely realized, bringing about a new and vibrant scene of red mountains and rivers in the Central Plains. This has powerfully promoted the current wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation across the entire province.

The situation is excellent, and the new journey begins. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Henan have deeply felt from their own struggles that following Chairman Mao means victory!

Last September, shortly after Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive that "within the proletariat, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions," the revolutionary workers of Henan swiftly responded. In early October, in the Zhengzhou region, 120,000 revolutionary workers from 14 industries and over 600 units in textiles, machinery, electricity, coal, and other sectors quickly achieved revolutionary unity according to their systems, industries, and departments. The first song of revolutionary unity echoed across the vast Central Plains. Subsequently, revolutionary unity was achieved in the Xinxiang region according to systems and departments. Industrial cities like Luoyang and Kaifeng, as well as coal cities like Hebi and Jiaozuo, also achieved unity according to departments and teams. The proletariat of Henan took the lead in driving the tide of revolutionary unity forward, sweeping across the Central Plains from industrial and mining areas to schools, from cities to rural areas. This rapidly led to the birth of the new revolutionary three-in-one combination power in Henan.

As soon as the Henan Revolutionary Committee was established, it placed the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives on revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination at the forefront of all work. On the first day of the committee's operation, it was decided that the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the standing committee of the provincial revolutionary committee would personally lead teams of workers and soldiers to form powerful propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought. They were sent to mining areas like Pingdingshan and western Henan, as well as to regions like Anyang, Nanyang, Kaifeng, and Zhoukou, to specifically help achieve revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The leaders of the provincial revolutionary committee and the workers and soldiers in the propaganda teams all went deep into the mines, work areas, workers' dormitories, and units where the two factions were opposed. They propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives on revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination since his inspection of the three regions. They conducted extensive and detailed ideological work with the leaders of various factions and the revolutionary masses. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the long-standing "hard-to-solve" problems in these regions were finally resolved one by one, achieving revolutionary unity according to systems and departments. The province quickly established unified "Workers' Congresses," "Peasants' Congresses," and "Red Guards (preparatory)." By this September, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of the three regions, from the northern foothills of the Taihang Mountains to the southern banks of the Huai River, from the eastern plains of eastern Henan to the southwestern Nanyang Basin, the red flags were flying across the thousand-li Zhongzhou, achieving a red tide across the entire province.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of Henan deeply realized from their own struggles that in fully implementing Chairman Mao's directives on revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, there is a fierce class struggle. When Chairman Mao just issued the call to achieve revolutionary unity according to systems, industries, and classes, a handful of class enemies immediately began to sabotage from the right or ultra-left. At that time, Henan had a black hand who was pushing rightist reversal, taking the opportunity to stir up trouble everywhere, inciting bourgeois factionalism, and pulling strings to overthrow the newly born revolutionary power. Some others with ulterior motives also used certain people's factionalism, small-groupism, and dispersionism to seize the opportunity to engage in rightist splitist activities, falsely claiming that "unity according to systems, industries, and teams is to erase the line struggle," that it is "rightist," "revisionist," and "a loss of power." In response to the sabotage activities of the class enemies, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Henan, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, led by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes," immediately launched a powerful struggle across the province to oppose rightist conservatism, rightist capitulationism, rightist splitism, and to smash the rightist reversal wind. They exposed the rightist reversal black backers and severely struck down a handful of class enemies.

At this time, a few bad elements appeared in an ultra-left guise, using the inflated egos and "revolutionary" sentiments of some in the revolutionary ranks to spread the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," causing some regions that had just achieved revolutionary unity according to systems and departments to split again into factions. In response to this situation, the Henan Revolutionary Committee and the broad proletarian revolutionary factions, taking the black backers of the rightist splitist activities in Pingdingshan as a "live target," launched a province-wide campaign to expose and criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," severely striking down a handful of class enemies and also educating those with serious anarchist tendencies.

In this struggle to eliminate the interference of class enemies from the right and ultra-left, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Henan strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, severely striking down the class enemies, firmly protecting the masses, and uniting all those who could be united. They pushed the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the province to a new stage.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." After leveling the factions and further achieving revolutionary unity according to systems and industries, the broad masses of revolutionaries, under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, launched a magnificent struggle against the enemy. Revolutionary workers in various factories and mines, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committees, vigorously carried out the work of cleaning up class ranks, gradually exposing the hidden class enemies who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and conducting struggles of criticism and struggle.

Before achieving revolutionary unity according to systems and industries, units with factional confrontations often engaged in internal strife, with big-character posters becoming weapons of mutual attack, and the walking capitalists were set aside, with revolutionary criticism shelved. After achieving revolutionary unity in organization and ideology, a widespread revolutionary criticism was launched. Since the first half of this year, from factories, enterprises, institutions, schools to rural areas, the entire province has, in conjunction with the current struggle tasks, launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. In coal mining areas such as Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Hebi, and with coal mining, tunneling, and mechanical teams as units, the reactionary revisionist line of Khrushchev's agents in the coal industry in the construction of political power was exposed and criticized, consolidating the new revolutionary power. With the help of worker propaganda teams, some colleges and secondary schools in Zhengzhou carried out a comprehensive criticism of the reactionary revisionist educational line according to departments and classes. In the heat of the educational revolution, the Red Guards, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, went to the mountains and countryside in batches, rushing to where the country most needed them.

The experience of Jingshan County in taking the "streamlined and efficient" path has blossomed throughout the province. Many factories, enterprises, and institutions have streamlined their office personnel by about two-thirds. A large number of cadres and engineering and technical personnel from factories and offices have gone down to the grassroots and workshops. In Pingdingshan Mine No. 4, where the streamlining work has been done relatively well, the past cumbersome system with 17 departments and 140-plus people has been completely eliminated. The mine revolutionary committee retained only 18 staff members, and the rest of the cadres and engineering and technical personnel have been sent to the coal mining front line.

The 50 million people of Henan, on this joyous occasion of celebrating the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Henan, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm, striving to launch a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    五千万中州儿女怀着胜利的喜悦欢庆毛主席视察三大区一周年
    毛主席提出的革命大联合的伟大原则在河南普遍实现
    全省不断地落实毛主席的指示，进一步巩固和发展了按系统、按行业、按部门的大联合，迅速带来了中原山河一片红的崭新局面，有力地推动了当前的斗、批、改高潮
    本报讯　太行展颜，黄河欢笑。在欢庆我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区一周年的大喜日子里，无限忠于毛主席的五千万中州儿女，回顾一年来紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断地落实毛主席“在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”的光辉指示，在河南全省进一步巩固和发展了按系统、按行业、按部门的革命大联合，迅速带来了中原山河一片红的崭新局面，有力地推动了当前全省范围内的斗、批、改高潮。
    形势无限好，骏马跃新程。河南的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，从自己的战斗历程中深深体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！
    去年九月下旬，毛主席刚发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的光辉指示，河南广大革命职工闻风而动，十月初，郑州地区的纺织、机械、电业、煤炭等十四个行业、六百多个单位的十二万名革命职工，很快实现了按系统、按行业、按部门的革命大联合，在辽阔中原响起了第一曲革命大联合的凯歌。接着，在新乡地区实现了按系统、按部门的革命大联合；工业城市洛阳、开封，煤城鹤壁、焦作等地，都按部门、按班组联合了。河南的工人阶级带头推动了革命大联合的洪流滚滚向前，从工矿到学校、从城市到农村，革命大联合的浪潮席卷了中原大地，迅速地促成了河南革命三结合的新政权的诞生。
    河南省革命委员会一成立，就把全面落实毛主席有关革命大联合、革命三结合的一系列最新指示，放在一切工作的首位。在省革委会开始工作的第一天，就决定由省革委会主任、副主任和常委们亲自率领工人和解放军组成强大的毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴平顶山、豫西等矿区和安阳、南阳、开封、周口等地区，具体帮助实现革命大联合和革命三结合。省革委会领导同志和宣传队的工人、解放军同志，都深入矿井、工区、职工宿舍和两派对立的单位，宣传毛主席视察三大区以来对革命大联合、革命三结合所作的一系列最新指示，对各派的头头及革命群众进行了大量的细致的思想工作。在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，终于使这些地区长期存在的“老大难”问题，一个个迎刃而解，实现了按系统、按部门的革命大联合。全省也很快成立了统一的“工代会”“农代会”“红代会（筹）”。到今年九月，正当伟大领袖毛主席视察三大区一周年之际，河南北起太行山下，南至淮河之滨，东自豫东平原，西南至南阳盆地，千里中州，红旗如画，实现了全省一片红。
    河南无产阶级革命派从自己战斗历程中深刻认识到：在全面落实毛主席有关革命大联合和革命三结合的指示中，贯穿着激烈的阶级斗争。当毛主席刚刚发出按照系统，按照行业，按照班级，实现革命的大联合的号召，一小撮阶级敌人便从右的或极“左”方面进行破坏。当时，河南有个大搞右倾翻案的黑手，乘机到处挑拨离间，煽动资产阶级派性，重拉山头，妄图颠覆新生的革命政权。还有一些别有用心的人也利用某些人的山头主义、小团体主义、分散主义，乘机大搞右倾分裂活动，胡说什么“按系统、按行业、按班组大联合是抹煞路线斗争”，是“右”了，“修”了，“丧权”了。针对阶级敌人的破坏活动，河南无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，遵照毛主席的“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”的教导，立即在全省范围内展开了声势浩大的反右倾保守主义、反右倾投降主义、反右倾分裂主义、粉碎右倾翻案妖风的斗争，揪出了右倾翻案的黑后台，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    这时，还有极少数坏人，以极“左”的面目出现，利用革命队伍中一些人头脑膨胀、唯我独“革”等情绪，散布反动的资产阶级“多中心论”，致使某些地区刚实现了按系统、按部门革命大联合，又重新拉出山头。针对这种情况，河南省革命委员会和广大无产阶级革命派，以平顶山大搞右倾分裂活动的黑后台为“活靶子”，在全省大揭大批反动的资产阶级“多中心论”，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，同时也教育了那些无政府主义严重的人。
    在这场排除阶级敌人从右的和极“左”方面干扰的斗争中，河南无产阶级革命派严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，狠狠打击阶级敌人，坚决保护群众，团结了一切可以团结的人，把全省革命大联合和革命三结合推进到一个崭新阶段。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”削平山头，进一步实现按系统、按行业的革命大联合后，广大革命群众，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，开展了轰轰烈烈的对敌斗争。各厂矿革命职工在革命委员会统一领导下，狠抓清理阶级队伍的工作，把混进革命队伍的暗藏的阶级敌人陆续清查出来，进行了批判斗争。
    在实现按系统、按行业的革命大联合之前，山头对峙的单位，往往“内战”不休，大字报变成了互相攻击的武器，走资派被放在一边，革命大批判束之高阁。在从组织上到思想上实现了革命大联合后，广泛开展了革命的大批判。今年上半年以来，从厂矿、企业、机关、学校到农村，全省普遍结合当前的斗争任务，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。在平顶山、焦作、鹤壁等煤矿区并以采煤、掘进、机电队组为单位，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫在煤炭战线的代理人在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，巩固了革命新政权。郑州一些大专院校和中等学校，在工人宣传队的帮助下，都按系、按班级开展了对反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判。在教育革命的热潮中，满怀革命豪情的红卫兵小将，一批批上山下乡，奔向祖国最需要的地方。
    灵宝县走“精兵简政”道路的经验，已在全省普遍开花。许多厂矿企业和机关，已精简机关科室人员三分之二左右，厂矿的大批干部和科室中的工程技术人员纷纷下到基层和车间。在精简工作做得比较好的平顶山四矿，已彻底破除了过去拥有十七个科室、一百四十多人的庞大旧机构。矿革委会只留了十八名工作人员，其余的干部和工程技术人员，已充实到采煤第一线。
    河南五千万人民在欢庆伟大领袖毛主席视察河南一周年之际，正满怀革命豪情，为掀起伟大的斗、批、改高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！
