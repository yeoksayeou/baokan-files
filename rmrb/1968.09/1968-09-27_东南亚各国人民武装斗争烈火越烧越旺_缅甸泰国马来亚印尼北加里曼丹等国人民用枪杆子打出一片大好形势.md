The armed struggles of the people in Burma, Thailand, Malaya, Indonesia, and North Kalimantan have been burning more fiercely since this year. In the deep mountains, dense forests, and on the islands, the people's fighters, undaunted by hardships and difficulties, have bravely fought against the modern weapons of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, repeatedly breaking through the enemy's "encirclement and suppression." The revolutionary people of these countries have seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war, raised the banner of national liberation, and steadfastly pushed forward the people's armed struggle.

Burma's People's Armed Forces Smash "Encirclement and Suppression" by Relying on the Masses

The Communist Party of Burma has adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power," leading the people of all nationalities in Burma to achieve major victories in smashing the large-scale counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" launched by the Burmese reactionary government, consolidating revolutionary bases, and developing revolutionary armed forces over the past year.

Since last August, the Burmese reactionary government, with the support of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, mobilized dozens of battalions to launch a frenzied attack on the Burmese armed revolutionary base areas such as the Bago Mountains.

Under the battle cry of Chairman De Bijn and the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party to "smash the enemy's offensive with an offensive," the Burmese people's armed forces and the revolutionary masses in the base areas actively and proactively joined the battle. The Burmese people's armed forces, when the enemy was deeply exhausted after penetrating the base area, launched repeated ambushes, annihilating the enemy's effective forces. At the same time, the Burmese people's armed forces attacked some medium and small towns in the enemy-occupied areas, sabotaged important transportation lines such as the Yangon-Mandalay railway, and achieved continuous victories. The brave fighting of the Burmese people's armed forces defended the revolutionary base areas, making the enemy's half-year-long counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" completely fail. According to incomplete statistics, during this anti-"encirclement and suppression" process, the people's armed forces fought 140 times, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

The people's armed forces in various parts of Burma adopted flexible guerrilla tactics, sometimes concentrating 100 to several hundred troops to attack and surround the reactionary military and police stationed in towns, sometimes sending small units to attack enemy police posts and moving enemies, repeatedly annihilating the enemy in whole squads and platoons, and seizing a large number of enemy weapons and equipment. They frequently attacked important railways, highways, and water transportation lines, forcing the enemy to disperse their forces and often being in a passive position of taking blows. Especially after achieving the victory of smashing the large-scale counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the Burmese reactionary government, the Burmese people's armed forces have been continuously taking the initiative to launch attacks in various regions, with victories coming one after another.

While carrying out the armed struggle, the Burmese Communist Party, according to the different characteristics of revolutionary base areas, guerrilla zones, and enemy-occupied areas, adopted various forms to extensively and deeply mobilize the masses. In some areas, they have been extensively carrying out the struggle against the reactionary government's plundering of grain, in some areas, they have been carrying out the struggle against traitors and local tyrants, and in some base areas, they have been implementing land reform. Awakened farmers have been destroying the reactionary government's ruling organs in the countryside and establishing red grassroots governments. Farmers have taken up arms and joined the ranks of the revolutionary armed struggle.

Thailand's People's Armed Struggle Regions Rapidly Expanding

The Communist Party of Thailand has led the Thai people to persist in armed struggle, achieving a great situation. The armed struggle regions have rapidly expanded. The people's armed forces are becoming stronger with each battle. Currently, the armed struggle regions have expanded from one county three years ago to more than 100 counties. This year, the Thai people's armed forces have consolidated their existing positions and opened up new activity regions in more than 10 counties in several provinces.

In the past year, the Thai people's armed forces have achieved the major feat of smashing the large-scale dry-season counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique. The U.S.-Thai reactionaries mobilized more than 60,000 military and police forces, using U.S.-made modern weapons, from last November to this May, and suffered a crushing defeat. The people's armed forces in the northeast also smashed the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" from March to July this year.

In the battle, the Thai people's armed forces paid attention to concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's effective forces. In the third year of the Thai people's armed struggle (August 1967 to July 1968), the people's armed forces annihilated 1,056 enemies, including nine U.S. soldiers. Together with the previous two years, a total of more than 2,400 enemies were annihilated, including more than 20 U.S. soldiers.

In addition to seizing modern weapons from the enemy, the Thai people's armed forces also used various homemade weapons, set traps, and other methods to strike the enemy. The weapons in the hands of the people's armed forces are much more powerful than the enemy's helicopters, tanks, and cannons.

On July 26 of this year, the people's armed forces in the northeast of Thailand's Udon Thani Province bravely attacked the Udon U.S. Air Force Base, severely punishing the U.S. aggressors. According to the U.S.-Thanom clique's admission, the brave fighters of the people's armed forces broke through the "guards'" heavy defenses, entered the airport, and blew up and damaged multiple U.S. planes, killing and wounding many U.S. aggressors and Thanom clique puppet soldiers.

The Thai people's armed forces attach great importance to mobilizing and organizing the peasant masses. They sent armed propaganda teams to go deep into large and small villages, blend in with the people, and help the people raise their class consciousness. The armed propaganda teams also punished the traitors and local tyrants who committed heinous crimes.

This year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed forces of the Miao people in northern Thailand have rapidly developed and grown stronger. The united struggle of the Thai people of all nationalities will deal a heavier blow to the U.S.-Thanom clique.

Malaya National Liberation Army Persists in Guerrilla Warfare

The Malayan National Liberation Army, led by the Communist Party of Malaya, has persisted in armed struggle for 20 years. Since last year, the enemy has repeatedly launched large-scale "encirclement and suppression" against the Malayan National Liberation Army, mobilizing tens of thousands of troops to conduct frequent "sweeping" and attacks day and night, attempting to annihilate the people's armed forces. However, under the fierce counterattacks of the Malayan people's armed forces, the enemy's attacks have been repeatedly defeated in disgrace.

On June 17 this year, the Malayan National Liberation Army launched a brilliant ambush in the northern state of Perak, achieving a complete victory by annihilating the entire platoon of 35 so-called "elite" "police field forces" of the British Empire-Lahman clique. In this battle, the liberation army seized 25 guns, 1,000 bullets, and a batch of military supplies, and destroyed three enemy vehicles. This brilliant victory has made the people of all nationalities in Malaya jubilant.

Indonesian People's Revolutionary Armed Forces Active in Rural Areas

Since this year, the armed struggle carried out by the Indonesian Communist Party members and other revolutionary people has developed further. In addition to the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan continuing to persist in the struggle, the revolutionary armed struggle torches have been lit in the vast rural areas and mountainous regions of two important islands in Indonesia—Java Island and Sumatra Island, among which the struggle on Java Island has considerable momentum.

The head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, openly admitted in a speech in mid-August this year that the Indonesian Communist Party members and other revolutionary people "have gathered sufficient strength, especially in East Java and Central Java." According to the reactionary newspapers in Jakarta, the people's revolutionary armed forces active on Java Island have repeatedly attacked the reactionary army this year, repeatedly sabotaged the railways and long-distance military telephone lines under the control of the Indonesian reactionaries. The people's revolutionary armed forces bravely fought in the vast rural areas of Java Island, making the reactionaries very frightened. Some county offices set up by the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime on Java Island were forced to close, and the reactionary county magistrates fled in panic.

Recently, the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime has mobilized a large number of reactionary troops, used various modern military equipment provided by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, deployed bombers, and cooperated with the reactionary landlord armed forces to concentrate on conducting counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" against the people's revolutionary armed forces in East Java and Central Java. The people's revolutionary armed forces on Java Island, under the support of the broad peasant masses, have bravely and tenaciously fought the anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles under harsh conditions.

The Indonesian Communist Party members firmly believe that as long as they continue to hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of the Indonesian revolution, rely on the masses, establish rural base areas, and use the countryside to surround the cities, the Indonesian people will surely defeat the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime.

North Kalimantan People's Armed Forces Establish Base Areas

Under the leadership of the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance, the North Kalimantan people's armed forces have smashed the joint "encirclement and suppression" by the "Malaysia" puppet regime supported by U.S.-British imperialism and the Indonesian fascist military regime, and established revolutionary armed struggle base areas.

The North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance has rapidly developed in cities, rural areas, and border areas. The people's armed forces, with the support of the peasant masses, have used flexible guerrilla tactics to annihilate the enemy's effective forces. According to the July issue of the North Kalimantan Liberation News, the people's armed forces annihilated 73 enemies in a single anti-"encirclement and suppression" battle. After the battle, the masses were overjoyed, holding coffee, standing by the roadside, welcoming the victorious return of the troops.

Great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without this, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power." The revolutionary people of Burma and other countries are determined to overthrow the reactionary ruling class through revolutionary armed struggle and establish the people's power. They firmly believe that as long as they combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of their own revolution, they will surely achieve revolutionary victory.

    东南亚各国人民武装斗争烈火越烧越旺
    缅甸泰国马来亚印尼北加里曼丹等国人民用枪杆子打出一片大好形势
    新华社二十五日讯　本社记者报道：今年以来，缅甸、泰国、马来亚、印尼、北加里曼丹等国人民革命武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。在深山里，在密林中，在岛屿上，人民战士不怕艰难困苦，藐视美帝苏修的现代化武器，奋勇战斗，一再打破反动派的“围剿”。这些国家的革命人民认真学习毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想，高举民族解放的战斗旗帜，坚定不移地把人民革命武装斗争不断推向前进。
    缅甸人民武装依靠群众粉碎“围剿”
    缅甸共产党坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的无产阶级革命路线，领导缅甸各族人民，在过去一年来取得了粉碎缅甸反动政府发动的大规模反革命“围剿”、巩固革命根据地和发展革命武装力量的重大胜利。
    去年八月以来，缅甸反动政府在美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团的支持下，动员了几十个营的兵力，向缅甸武装革命根据地勃固山区等地，发动了疯狂的进攻。
    在德钦丹东主席和缅共中央“以进攻粉碎敌人的进攻”这一战斗号召下，缅甸人民武装和根据地广大革命人民积极、主动地投入了战斗。缅甸人民武装在敌人深入根据地到处扑空、疲惫不堪的时候，多次伏击敌人，歼灭敌人的有生力量。同时，缅甸人民武装进攻了敌占区的一些中、小城镇，袭击了仰光—曼德勒铁路等重要交通线，接连取得胜利。缅甸人民武装的英勇作战，保卫了革命根据地，使敌人持续半年多的反革命“围剿”彻底破产。据不完全统计，在这次反“围剿”过程中，人民武装共作战一百四十多次，给敌人以沉重打击。
    缅甸各地人民武装采取机动灵活的游击战术，有时集中一百人到几百人的优势兵力，进攻和包围驻守城镇的反动军警，有时派出小部队袭击敌人的警察哨所和运动中的敌人，多次整班整排地歼灭敌人，并且夺取大批敌人的武器和物资装备自己。他们频繁地袭击一些重要的铁路、公路和水上运输线，迫使敌人分散兵力，经常处于被动挨打的地位。特别是在取得粉碎缅甸反动政府的大规模反革命“围剿”以后，缅甸人民武装在各地区不断主动出击，捷报一个接一个。
    缅甸共产党在开展革命武装斗争的同时，按照革命根据地、游击区和敌占区的不同特点，采取各种形式，广泛深入地发动群众。有些地区持续地广泛地开展了反对反动政府掠夺粮食的斗争，有些地区进行锄奸反霸，有些根据地正在实行土地改革。觉醒的农民纷纷起来摧毁反动政府在农村的统治机构，建立红色基层政权。农民们拿起武器，纷纷投入革命武装斗争的行列。
    泰国人民武装斗争地区迅速扩展
    泰国共产党领导泰国人民坚持进行武装斗争，打出了一派大好形势。武装斗争地区迅速扩展。人民武装力量越战越强。目前，武装斗争地区从三年前的一个县扩展到了一百多个县。今年来，泰国人民武装巩固了已有的阵地，并且在几个府的十多个县中开辟了新的活动地区。
    一年来，泰国人民武装的重大战果是粉碎了美国—他侬反动集团的大规模旱季反革命“围剿”。美泰反动派投入了六万多军警，使用美制现代化武器，从去年十一月到今年五月进行了这场“围剿”，结果遭到惨败。东北部的人民武装，还粉碎了敌人从今年三月到七月的反革命“围剿”。
    泰国人民武装在战斗中，注意集中优势兵力，消灭敌人的有生力量。在泰国人民武装斗争的第三年（一九六七年八月——一九六八年七月），人民武装共歼敌一千零五十六名，包括美军九名。连同前两年，总共歼敌两千四百多名，包括美军二十多名。
    泰国人民武装除了从敌人那里夺取现代化武器以外，还使用了各种土造武器，设置陷阱等办法打击敌人。人民武装手中的这些武器，比敌人的直升飞机、坦克、大炮厉害得多。
    今年七月二十六日，泰国东北部乌隆府人民武装英勇地袭击了乌隆美国空军基地，严惩了美国侵略者。据美国—他侬集团供认，英勇的人民武装战士，冲破“卫兵”的重重防线，进入机场，用炸药炸毁、炸坏美国飞机多架，打死、打伤美国侵略军和他侬集团傀儡兵多人。
    泰国人民武装十分重视发动和组织农民群众。他们派出武装宣传队，深入大小村庄，同人民群众打成一片，帮助群众提高阶级觉悟。武装宣传队还惩处了罪大恶极的特务和地主恶霸。
    今年来，在泰国共产党的领导下，泰国北部的苗族人民武装迅速发展壮大。泰国各族人民的团结斗争，将给予美国—他侬集团更加沉重的打击。
    马来亚民族解放军坚持游击战
    马来亚共产党所领导的马来亚民族解放军，坚持武装斗争已经二十年。去年以来，敌人不断地对马来亚民族解放军发动大规模的“围剿”，调动数以千计的军队，日夜不停地进行频繁的“扫荡”和袭击，妄图消灭人民武装。但是，在马来亚人民武装力量的英勇反击下，敌人的进攻都一次一次地遭到了可耻的失败。
    今年六月十七日，马来亚民族解放军在马来亚北部霹雳州的高乌打了一个漂亮的伏击战，取得了全歼英帝—拉赫曼集团所谓“精锐”的“警察野战部队”全排三十五人的辉煌胜利。在这一战斗中，解放军缴获了二十五支枪、一千发子弹和一批军用物资，毁坏敌人军车三辆。这个辉煌胜利，使马来亚各族人民欢欣鼓舞。
    印尼人民革命武装活跃在广大农村
    今年以来，印尼共产党人和其他革命人民开展的武装斗争，有了新的发展。除了西加里曼丹的人民革命武装正在继续坚持斗争以外，在印尼的两个重要岛屿——爪哇岛和苏门答腊岛的广大农村和山区也点起了革命武装斗争的火炬，其中爪哇岛的斗争具有相当的声势。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的头目苏哈托今年八月中旬在一篇讲话中公开承认，印尼共产党人和其他革命人民“已经聚集了足够的力量，特别是在东爪哇和中爪哇”。据雅加达反动报纸透露，活跃在爪哇岛上的人民革命武装今年以来曾多次袭击反动军队，多次破坏在印尼反动派控制下的铁路交通和长途军用电话线。人民革命武装在爪哇岛广大农村英勇战斗使反动派十分恐惧。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权设在爪哇岛上的有的县衙门曾被迫关门，反动县长卷起铺盖仓惶逃窜。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权最近一个时期，调动了大批反动军队，使用了美帝和苏修提供的各种现代化军事装备，出动了轰炸机，并配合反动的地主武装，对东爪哇和中爪哇的人民革命武装集中进行反革命“围剿”。爪哇岛的人民革命武装在艰苦条件下，依靠广大农民群众的支持，英勇顽强地进行了反“围剿”战斗。
    印尼共产党人坚信，只要继续高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理与本国革命具体实践相结合，坚持依靠群众，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，印尼人民最后一定会打败苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权。
    北加里曼丹人民武装建立根据地
    在北加里曼丹民族解放同盟的领导下，北加里曼丹人民武装，粉碎了美英帝国主义支持下的“马来西亚”傀儡政权和印尼法西斯军人政权的联合“围剿”，建立了革命武装斗争根据地。
    北加里曼丹民族解放同盟组织在城市、在农村、在边区迅速发展起来了。人民武装在农民群众的支持下，运用机动灵活的游击战术，消灭敌人的有生力量。据北加里曼丹《解放报》七月号报道，人民武装在一次反“围剿”战斗中，曾经一举歼敌七十三名。战斗结束后，群众兴高彩烈，端着咖啡，站在道旁，欢迎子弟兵凯旋归来。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”缅甸等国的革命人民都决心用革命武装斗争推翻反动的统治阶级，建立人民的政权。他们坚信：只要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理同本国革命具体实践相结合，就一定能夺取革命的胜利。
