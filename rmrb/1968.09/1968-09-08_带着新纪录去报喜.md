On the evening of September 6th, at 8:30 PM, seven workers from the second team of the third shift of the Beijing West Railway Station were busy loading supplies onto a freight train bound for the border. At that moment, the Central People's Broadcasting Station announced the joyous news: The Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located on the frontlines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism in southwestern and northwestern China, were born amidst the triumphant songs of the nationwide proletarian cultural revolution! The entire team immediately erupted in excitement, and everyone joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They sang loudly, "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" The platform was filled with cheers, and drums and firecrackers resounded!

With the red sun rising in our hearts, no difficulty can stop us. The seven workers realized that the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Worker Jin Fuhai excitedly said, "Comrades, let's go! Seize the time, load more and faster, support border construction, and report our excellent results to Chairman Mao!" On the tense battlefield, every red heart was beating fiercely, and every smiling face was facing the red sun. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the workers competed eagerly and worked selflessly. After 35 minutes of battle, they completed the loading of 30 tons of insulated cars, setting a new record for loading speed at the station. They were filled with joy and immediately brought the new record to Zhongnanhai to report the good news.

It was already past one in the morning when they returned from reporting the news. The seven workers' excitement lasted for a long time. They sat together and discussed eagerly. These seven workers had experienced the hardships of being porters in the old society and had tasted the sweetness of being masters in the new society. They loved the new society the most and were the most loyal to Chairman Mao. Old worker Liu Dehai said excitedly, "In the old society, who respected us porters? As the saying goes, porters are just a piece of cloth over their shoulders, either carrying or pulling. Working to death, one person couldn't even support one person, and if things went wrong, they would often get beaten. Now, Chairman Mao supports us workers, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and play a leading role in the proletarian class in the educational revolution and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various fields of the superstructure, and strive to promote revolution and production."

"Following Chairman Mao, always do revolution! Following Chairman Mao, the world will be red!" This is the determination and confidence of these porters.

After the discussion, everyone continued to work until dawn.

    带着新纪录去报喜
    九月六日晚上八点半钟，北京西直门火车站二连二排三班的七个工人，正在站台上紧张地给一列开往边疆的货车装载物资。这时，从中央人民广播电台传来了振奋人心的大喜讯：地处我国西南、西北反帝反修前哨的西藏自治区革命委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，同时胜利诞生了！全班立即沸腾起来，大家纵情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”放声地歌唱《敬祝毛主席万寿无疆》。站台上欢呼声连成一片，锣鼓鞭炮齐响！
    心中升起红太阳，千难万险无阻挡。七个工人都认识到，西藏自治区革命委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会的诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！工人金富海高兴地说：“同志们，干啊！争取时间，多装快运，支援边疆建设，以优异的成绩向毛主席报喜！”在紧张的战斗岗位上，颗颗红心在激烈地跳动，张张笑脸迎着红太阳。工人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，争先恐后，忘我工作。经过三十五分钟的战斗，完成了三十吨保温车的装载任务，创造了这个站历史上装车速度的最高纪录。他们满怀胜利的喜悦，马上带着新纪录到中南海去报喜。
    报喜回来，已经深夜一点多了，七个工人的心情久久不能平静。他们坐在一起，激动地讨论开了。这七个工人经受过旧社会装卸工人的牛马苦，也尝到了新社会翻身作主人的甜。他们对新社会最热爱，对毛主席最忠诚。老工人刘德海激动地说：“旧社会谁瞧得起我们装卸工人？常言道，装卸工人是两尺半的包皮往肩上一搭，不是背就是拉。累死累活，一个人养活不了一个人，弄得不好还要经常挨揍。现在，毛主席为咱们工人撑腰，咱们一定要给毛主席争气！咱们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真地搞好斗、批、改，在教育革命和上层建筑各个领域的斗批改中发挥工人阶级的领导作用，努力抓革命促生产。”
    “跟着毛主席，永远干革命！跟着毛主席，世界一片红！”这就是这几个装卸工人的决心和信心。
    座谈完了，大家又继续投入了战斗，直到黎明。
