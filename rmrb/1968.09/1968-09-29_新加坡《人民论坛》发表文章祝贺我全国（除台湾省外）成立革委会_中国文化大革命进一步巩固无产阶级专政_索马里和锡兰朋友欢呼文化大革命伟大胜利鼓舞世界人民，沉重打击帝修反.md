Newspaper "People's Forum" of the Malayan Party, Singapore People's Party, published an article on September 15, enthusiastically congratulating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) and celebrating the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution across the nation.

The article emphasizes: "The great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution fully demonstrates the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Therefore, this victory is also a great victory for Chairman Mao in defending and creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. It has made an immeasurable great contribution to the international workers' movement."

The article points out that the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has thoroughly shattered the illusions of a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, who attempted to restore capitalism in China. It has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries' dream of "peaceful evolution" in China completely bankrupt! This victory has successfully defended and further consolidated the revolutionary government of the proletarian dictatorship, ensuring that the socialist mountains of China will never change color.

The article states: "Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Cultural Revolution, will more firmly, powerfully, and effectively support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. This will greatly encourage the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Western Europe, North America, and those under the rule of modern revisionism who are in the midst of struggle, promoting the rapid advance of the world revolutionary movement and submerging the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in the vast ocean of the people's struggle."

The article writes: The revolutionary people of Malaya (including Singapore) most enthusiastically congratulate the great victory achieved by the Chinese revolutionary masses and, with the greatest enthusiasm, shout long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! The revolutionary people of Malaya sincerely wish the great teacher Chairman Mao a long life!

The article concludes: "We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the great teacher Chairman Mao, the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and tested by the stormy class struggle of the Cultural Revolution, will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and achieve a complete and thorough victory!"

According to Xinhua News Agency on September 28, a leader of a political party in Somalia and a teacher from Sri Lanka enthusiastically celebrated the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province).

The General Secretary of the Political Bureau of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary Workers' Party, Abdurazak Nur Hersi, on behalf of the party's Central Committee, recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Mogadishu, congratulating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province). "We are very pleased that all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) have established revolutionary committees. We are more convinced that China will never change politically and will forever remain the strongest revolutionary bastion in the world."

He said: "The establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) is a great support and encouragement to all revolutionary peoples and a heavy blow to the imperialists and their allies."

A teacher from Sri Lanka recently wrote to the Xinhua News Agency's Colombo bureau, pointing out that the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the Cultural Revolution. This will ensure that red China will never change color. China will thus become a stronghold against imperialism.

The letter concludes: "May the revolutionary committees advance from victory to victory, making greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the international revolutionary cause! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

    文章强调指出：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，充分说明了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级和阶级斗争的学说的无比正确，再一次证明了毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。所以，这一胜利也是毛主席捍卫和创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，它为国际工人运动作出了不可估量的伟大贡献。”
    文章指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，彻底粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派妄图在中国复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，使帝、修、反在中国实行“和平演变”的痴心妄想彻底破产了！这一胜利，成功地保卫和进一步巩固了中国无产阶级专政的革命政权，使中国社会主义江山永不变色有了可靠的保证。
    文章说：“在毛泽东思想的哺育下，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民更坚强、更有力、更有效地支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，这必将极大地鼓舞正在斗争中的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、西欧北美以及在现代修正主义统治下的各国人民，促使世界革命运动更迅猛地滚滚向前，让帝、修、反更快地淹没在人民斗争的汪洋大海中。”
    文章写道：马来亚（包括新加坡）革命人民，最热烈地祝贺中国无产阶级革命派取得的这一伟大胜利，并以最大的热情高呼毛泽东思想、毛主席无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！马来亚革命人民衷心祝愿伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！
    文章最后写道：“我们坚信，在伟大导师毛主席的英明领导下，经过无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨般阶级斗争考验和锻炼的七亿中国人民，一定能够将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，取得无产阶级文化大革命的全面、彻底胜利！”

    索马里社会主义革命工人党政治局总书记阿卜杜拉齐兹·努尔·赫尔西代表这个党的中央委员会，最近向驻摩加迪沙的新华社记者发表谈话，就中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立，“向中国人民、中国共产党以及他们的伟大领袖毛主席致以衷心的祝贺”。
    他说：“全中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立，我们感到十分高兴。我们更加深信，中国在政治上将决不会改变颜色，并将永远成为世界上最强大的革命堡垒。”
    他说：“全中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立，是对一切革命人民的巨大支持和鼓舞，是对帝国主义者及其同盟者的沉重打击。”
    一位锡兰教师最近给新华社驻科伦坡分社写信指出，中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这将保证红彤彤的中国永不改变颜色。中国从而成为反对帝国主义的坚固堡垒。
    这封信最后说：“祝革命委员会从胜利走向胜利，为中国革命事业和国际革命事业作出更大的贡献！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！”
