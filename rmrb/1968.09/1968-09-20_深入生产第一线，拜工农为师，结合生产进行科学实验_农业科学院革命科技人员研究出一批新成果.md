The revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture have achieved a series of new results in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have thoroughly criticized the revisionist scientific research line of China's Khrushchev, broken away from the old way of thinking, and have made new contributions to the development of agricultural science in China.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have thoroughly criticized the revisionist scientific research line of China's Khrushchev, and have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war." They have studied and summarized a series of new achievements, making new contributions to China's agricultural production.

In the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have exposed a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have criticized the revisionist scientific research line of China's Khrushchev, breaking the monopoly of a few bourgeois technical authorities over scientific research work. In the past, a small handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical authorities controlled scientific research work, resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, greatly hindering the development of scientific research work. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a revolutionary criticism of the entire set of revisionist scientific research lines of the past, determined to follow the scientific research path indicated by Chairman Mao. They have reformed scientific research projects, stopped a number of projects that were detached from production, detached from reality, and detached from the masses, and increased a number of projects that met the needs of agricultural production. They have also initially reformed a number of unreasonable regulations and systems, quickly bringing about a new situation in scientific research work. In the past, the research on new varieties of crops, under the control of bourgeois technical authorities, had established a set of cumbersome "procedures" that no one dared to touch. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Institute of Crop Breeding and Cultivation broke away from this set of cumbersome "procedures," directly sending a winter wheat hybrid, which was once considered by bourgeois technical authorities to have "no future," to the countryside to be identified and tested by poor and lower-middle peasants. In just two years, they confirmed its promotion value, suitable areas, and initial cultivation measures, greatly shortening the time from identification to promotion, and officially naming it "Red Flag No. 1." This new variety of winter wheat, jointly cultivated by workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel, has the advantages of being resistant to rust, cold, and drought, and having white grains and good quality, and has been welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture, following Chairman Mao's instructions that intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sent a group of people to the frontlines of agricultural production to conduct scientific experiments in combination with production together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Because these scientific and technological personnel have learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, combining scientific knowledge with the rich experience of the masses and combining research work with production practice, they have solved some long-standing problems. Strangles is a serious infectious disease that harms livestock. Capitalist countries and revisionist countries have no good prevention and treatment methods for this disease and can only solve the problem by slaughtering sick horses. In our country, due to the interference and sabotage of the revisionist scientific research line over the past decade, this problem has not been well solved. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute severely criticized the revisionist scientific research line. They, following Chairman Mao's instructions, went to the poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct investigations and research, humbly listening to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and discovered many effective experiences in preventing and treating strangles. They combined these advanced experiences, summarized preliminary opinions on the prevention and treatment of strangles, and found a new way to prevent and treat the disease.

During the process of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian scientific research line, the broad revolutionary scientific workers have encountered sabotage and disruption by a small handful of class enemies. Yellow mustard cabbage is an important vegetable grown in several provinces in southern China. In the past, due to the promotion of "crawlingism" and "profit-first" by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the departments of agriculture, commerce, and science and technology, the problem of the original seeds of yellow mustard cabbage has not been solved for a long time, and every year the seeds have to be imported from abroad. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the political awareness of the broad revolutionary masses has reached an unprecedented height, recognizing that solving the problem of the original seeds of yellow mustard cabbage according to Chairman Mao's instructions of self-reliance is a political task directly related to the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. With the strong promotion and support of relevant departments in Guangdong, Liaoning, Shandong, Beijing, and other regions, the workers of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture's farm and the revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Vegetable Research Institute have decided to solve the problem of the original seeds of yellow mustard cabbage through self-reliance. However, as soon as they began their research and experiments, they were obstructed and sabotaged by a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture. The broad revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Vegetable Research Institute, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, promptly exposed and foiled the plots of this small handful of capitalist-roaders, continuing to insist on research, and shifting the focus of the experiments to the people's communes, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct the experiments, ensuring the smooth progress of this research work. Now, the original seeds of yellow mustard cabbage, jointly cultivated by workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel, have been successfully tested in Guangdong and other regions. From the test results, in terms of balling rate, flat head rate, ball compactness, yield, and other aspects, they have surpassed the imported seeds.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao instructed us: "Students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority, can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old way of thinking. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's great instructions have pointed out a revolutionary path for Chinese intellectuals to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers under the leadership of the working class. The revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture are determined to firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly change their old way of thinking, and make new contributions to the development of agricultural science in China.

    深入生产第一线，拜工农为师，结合生产进行科学实验
    农业科学院革命科技人员研究出一批新成果
    他们决心坚定不移地走毛主席指引的道路，接受工农兵的再教育；继续批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义科研路线，彻底改造旧思想，为促进我国农业科学的发展作出新的贡献
    据新华社十九日讯　中国农业科学院的革命科技人员在无产阶级文化大革命中，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义科研路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级科研路线，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，研究和总结出一批新的成果，为我国农业生产作出了新的贡献。
    在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国农业科学院的无产阶级革命派和革命群众在毛主席革命路线的指引下，揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和未改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义科研路线，打破了少数资产阶级技术权威垄断科研工作的局面。过去，院内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术权威把持科研工作，抵制毛主席的革命路线，大大妨碍了科研工作的发展。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派和革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，对过去的一整套修正主义科研路线展开了革命的大批判，决心走毛主席指引的科研道路。他们对科研项目进行了改革，停止了一批脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的项目，增加了一批适应农业生产需要的项目，并对不合理的规章制度进行了初步的改革，使科研工作迅速出现了新的气象。过去，农作物新品种的研究，在资产阶级技术权威的把持下，规定了一套烦琐的“程序”，谁也不许触动。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，作物育种栽培研究所的工人群众和革命科技人员破除了这一套烦琐的“程序”，把一种曾被资产阶级技术权威认为“没有前途”的冬小麦杂交后代，直接放到农村去依靠贫下中农进行鉴定、试种，只经过两年时间就肯定了推广价值、适应地区和初步的栽培措施，大大缩短了从鉴定到推广的时间，正式定名为“红旗一号”。这一由工人、贫下中农、革命科技人员共同培育出来的冬小麦新品种，具有抗锈、耐寒、耐旱和粒白、质好等优点，受到了广大贫下中农的欢迎。
    中国农业科学院的革命科技人员，遵照毛主席关于知识分子必须同工农群众相结合的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中，抽调一批人深入到农业生产第一线，同贫下中农一道结合生产进行科学实验。由于这些科技人员拜贫下中农为师，把科学知识同群众的丰富经验结合起来，把研究工作同生产实践结合起来，解决了一些长期不能解决的难题。马鼻疽病是一种严重危害家畜的传染病，资本主义国家和修正主义国家对这种病都没有较好的防治方法，只能用宰杀病马的手段来解决。在我国，过去十几年中由于修正主义科研路线的干扰和破坏，这个问题也未能很好地解决。在无产阶级文化大革命中，哈尔滨兽医研究所的革命科技人员狠批了修正主义的科研路线。他们根据毛主席的教导，深入到贫下中农中去进行调查研究，虚心听取贫下中农的意见，发现了许多防治马鼻疽病成效很好的经验。他们把这些先进经验进行综合研究，总结出防治马鼻疽病的初步意见，为防治马鼻疽病找到了一条新的途径。
    广大的革命科学工作者在贯彻毛主席无产阶级科研路线的过程中，遭到了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏与捣乱。黄苗甘蓝是我国南方几个省区种植的一种重要蔬菜。在过去，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农业、商业、科学技术部门的代理人推行“爬行主义”、
  “利润挂帅”等一套反革命修正主义黑货，黄苗甘蓝原种问题长期不能解决，每年用种都靠国外进口。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，广大革命群众的政治觉悟空前提高，认识到按照毛主席教导的自力更生的方针解决黄苗甘蓝原种问题，是一项直接与帝、修、反作斗争的政治任务。在广东、辽宁、山东、北京等地区有关部门的大力推动和支持下，中国农业科学院农场工人和蔬菜研究所的革命科技人员决心自力更生解决黄苗甘蓝原种问题。但是，他们一开始进行研究和试验，就遭到农业科学院党内一小撮走资派的阻挠和破坏。蔬菜研究所的广大革命科技人员以毛泽东思想为武器，及时识破和粉碎了这一小撮走资派的阴谋，继续坚持研究，并把试验重点放到人民公社，依靠贫下中农搞试验，保证了这项研究工作的顺利进行。现在，由工人、贫下中农和革命科技人员相结合培育出来的黄苗甘蓝原种，已经在广东等地区试种成功。从试种结果看，在结球率、平头率、结球紧实度、产量等方面，均超过进口种子。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的伟大指示，为我国知识分子指出了一条在工人阶级领导下同工农兵相结合的革命大道。中国农业科学院的革命科技人员，决心坚定不移地走毛主席指引的道路，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造旧思想，为促进我国农业科学的发展作出新的贡献。
