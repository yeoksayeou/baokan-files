The Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Factory, after sending a team of workers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the Jiangxi Medical College, frequently organized workers who remained in the factory to go to the school. They worked with the propaganda team to introduce the excellent situation of class struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory, as well as the vivid examples of how the working class is firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. The propaganda team organized revolutionary teachers and students to participate in labor at the factory and held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, engaging in revolutionary criticism together with the workers. In this way, they promoted both the educational revolution in the school and the class struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory.

	New China News Agency, Nanchang, September 11 — The Revolutionary Committee of the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "fully utilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work," has taken further measures to strengthen the connection between the factory and the school after sending a team of workers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the Jiangxi Medical College. This has promoted both the educational revolution in the school and the class struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory.

	After sending the team of workers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the school, the Revolutionary Committee of the factory frequently organized workers who remained in the factory to go to the school. They worked with the team to introduce the excellent situation of class struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory and the vivid examples of how the working class is firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. This educated and inspired the revolutionary teachers and students to take the working class as their example and seriously carry out the proletarian educational revolution. The team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the school organized revolutionary teachers and students to participate in labor at the factory and held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They helped the revolutionary teachers and students raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, fostering their proletarian sentiments. Some teachers and students originally had a weak sense of class struggle and did not deeply hate or thoroughly criticize the class enemies in the school. After engaging in revolutionary criticism with the workers in the factory, they saw the broad masses of revolutionary workers angrily denouncing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory. This provided them with a vivid and profound education in class struggle. Upon returning to the school, the revolutionary teachers and students immediately launched a criticism and struggle against the unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies, sparking a new high tide in the struggle against the enemy. The revolutionary teachers and students resolved to carry out the educational revolution to the end under the leadership of the working class.

	At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee of the factory actively organized the members of the team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought to promptly introduce the situation in the school to the workers who remained in the factory, promoting the revolution and production in the factory. The team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought introduced to the broad masses of workers the various phenomena and consequences of how the bourgeois intellectuals dominated the school. This greatly aroused the intense hatred of the workers who remained in the factory towards China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. For example, after they introduced the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders in the medical college who colluded with reactionary academic "authorities" to seize control of the school and exclude the children of workers and peasants, the workers who remained in the factory were very indignant. The workers who remained in the factory resolved to support the team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought in leading the school to thoroughly carry out the educational revolution with their actual actions of carrying out the revolution and production well. The team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought also frequently introduced to all the workers in the factory the new revolutionary scene that appeared in the school after they propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives. This greatly inspired the workers who remained in the factory. The workers who remained in the factory excitedly said: The propaganda team is leading the school to carry out the educational revolution vigorously, and we must also carry out the revolution and production in the factory even better! The workers in the third workshop, with revolution guiding production, reduced personnel by one-tenth, but production reached an all-time high.

	The Revolutionary Committee of the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Factory also established a small and efficient leadership team, including a deputy director and a military representative, specifically to lead and organize the connection between the factory and the school. The members of this leadership team frequently went to the team of workers propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the school to understand the situation. They brought back to the factory the problems encountered by the propaganda team in their work for research, and with the help of the workers who remained in the factory, some problems were quickly resolved.

	After sending the team of workers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the school, the Revolutionary Committee of the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Factory strengthened the connection between the factory and the school, making the educational revolution in the school rapidly advance. The revolution and production in the factory were even more prosperous. On the basis of revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, the original more than six hundred office personnel in this factory have already been reduced and reassigned by five hundred people. They also reformed some unreasonable management systems in the workshops and teams, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary staff. With the deepening of class struggle, criticism, and transformation, a mass technical revolution has arrived.

    发动广大工人对学校师生进行再教育
    江西拖拉机制造厂在派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻江西医学院后，经常组织留厂工人到学校去，配合宣传队向革命师生员工介绍工厂里斗批改的大好形势，和工人阶级狠抓革命、猛促生产的事迹；宣传队则组织革命师生到工厂来参加劳动，举办毛泽东思想学习班，同工人一道开展革命大批判。这样，既推动了学校的教育革命，又促进了工厂的斗批改
    新华社南昌十一日电　江西拖拉机制造厂革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，在派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻江西医学院后，进一步采取措施，加强工厂和学校的联系，既推动了学校的教育革命，又促进了工厂的斗、批、改。
    这个厂的革委会在派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队到学校里去以后，经常组织留厂工人到学校去，配合工人毛泽东思想宣传队向革命师生员工介绍工厂里斗、批、改的大好形势和工人阶级狠抓革命、猛促生产的生动事迹，教育和激励革命师生员工以工人阶级为榜样，认真搞好无产阶级教育革命。驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队则组织革命师生到工厂来参加劳动和举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命师生提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，培养他们的无产阶级思想感情。部分师生原来阶级斗争观念不强，对学校的阶级敌人恨得不深，批得不透，经过同厂里的工人一道开展革命大批判，他们看到广大革命工人愤怒控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人的滔天罪行，受到生动深刻的阶级斗争教育。革命师生们回到学校后立即对死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务展开了批判和斗争，掀起了对敌斗争的新高潮。革命师生们决心在工人阶级领导下，把学校教育革命进行到底。
    与此同时，这个厂的革委会又积极组织参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，把学校的情况及时介绍给留在厂里的工人，推动工厂的革命和生产。工人毛泽东思想宣传队把资产阶级知识分子统治学校的各种现象及其恶果介绍给广大工人，大大激发了留厂工人对中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的反革命修正主义教育路线的无比仇恨。例如，他们介绍了医学院一小撮走资派勾结资产阶级反动学术“权威”，霸占学校，排斥工农子弟等罪行后，留厂工人十分气愤。留厂工人决心以搞好革命和生产的实际行动，支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队领导学校彻底搞好教育革命。工人毛泽东思想宣传队还把他们进驻学校宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示后，学校出现的崭新革命景象，经常介绍给全厂工人，使留厂工人深受鼓舞。留厂工人激动地说：宣传队领导学校把教育革命搞得轰轰烈烈，我们也要把工厂的革命和生产搞得好上加好！三车间工人以革命统帅生产，人员减少了十分之一，生产却达到历史最高水平。
    江西拖拉机制造厂革委会还设立了一个包括有副主任和军队代表参加的精悍的领导班子，专门领导和组织工厂同学校之间的联系。这个领导班子的成员经常到驻校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队中去，了解情况，把宣传队在工作中遇到的问题，及时带回工厂进行研究，在留厂工人的帮助下，有些问题很快就得到了解决。
    江西拖拉机制造厂革委会在派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校以后，加强工厂同学校的联系，使学校的教育革命迅猛向前发展。工厂里革命、生产更是一派大好景象。在革命大批判、清理阶级队伍的基础上，这个厂原有的六百多名科室人员，已经精简下放了五百多人。他们还改革了车间班组的一些不合理的管理制度，调动了广大革命职工的积极性。随着斗、批、改的深入发展，一个群众性的技术革命的高潮已经到来。
