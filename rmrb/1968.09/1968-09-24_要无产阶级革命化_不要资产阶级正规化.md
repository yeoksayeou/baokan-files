    For Proletarian Revolutionization, Not Bourgeois Regularization
    Deputy Squadron Leader of an Air Force Unit, Wang Dahé
    Pilot, Wang Cunzhou

    Chairman Mao teaches us that the construction of the people's army must emphasize proletarian politics and must first be built on a political foundation.

    The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai, however, raised the banner of "regularization" to push the bourgeois military line. He shouted slogans such as: "So-called regularization is to thoroughly unify the standards of our military regulations." He advocated for "unified training, unified systems, unified organization, unified discipline, and unified equipment" as the sole standards for "regularization." This is a complete copy of the bourgeois and revisionist military regulations, attempting to remove the soul of our army—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought—and to discard the historical experiences and fine traditions of our army, such as the Three Democracies, political work systems, and the mass line, etc.!

    The growth and strength of our army rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, not on some so-called "regularization." Especially for our People's Air Force, it was established under the personal care of Chairman Mao and on the foundation of the ground forces. In the early days of the founding of the nation, a large number of former cowherds and farmers, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, became outstanding pilots and shattered the U.S. imperialists' "air superiority." Was this the result of implementing some so-called "regularization"? No! It was achieved by emphasizing proletarian politics and the consciousness and bravery of the soldiers. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's political military line.

    Peng Dehuai attempted to fundamentally negate the valuable experiences of building the People's Air Force that were summarized from practice. He peddled the junk of the bourgeoisie and revisionists, emphasizing the decisive role of weapons and technology, emphasizing the comprehensiveness and systematic nature of flight theory, and completely ignoring the human factor. According to his so-called "regularization" requirements, theoretical subjects and flight practice were expanded indefinitely in training, resulting in a severe impact on politics and an indefinite extension of the school system. He also established various examination systems, making us bury our heads in professional and technical studies all day. Peng Dehuai thus, under the guise of "regularization," brazenly sabotaged the construction of our People's Air Force. This is intolerable!

    Peng Dehuai's bourgeois "regularization" is a rigid framework that does not meet the needs of war preparedness. We air force soldiers resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought. Pilot Fang Hongchao, during a training session, unexpectedly encountered a complex situation where the altitude rapidly decreased, and below was a mountainous area with towering peaks, making the situation extremely dangerous. At this critical moment, the command to bail out was given. According to Peng Dehuai's so-called "regularization" regulations, in such a situation, Fang Hongchao should immediately bail out. However, Fang Hongchao, in this life-or-death emergency, first thought of his responsibility to the people. Chairman Mao's teachings gave him the greatest courage and strength. He calmly and wisely overcame the complex situation, turning the flight from danger to safety. Air flight, especially mission execution, is full of changes. One must have courage and flexible strategies and tactics to overcome difficulties and complete missions. If Peng Dehuai's "regularization" were implemented, what kind of consequences would it bring to our air force construction? Isn't it obvious?

    Chairman Mao's military line is the lifeline of our army. Whether it's this "ization" or that "ization," the most important thing is to achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking; whether it's this unification or that unification, the most important thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Peng Dehuai's "izations" and "unifications" are all about not wanting the revolutionization of thinking; he wants to mix fish eyes with pearls, attempting to "unify" away Chairman Mao's political military line and achieve his plot to seize the military. We will not tolerate this! We deeply understand that only by taking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and achieving the revolutionization of people's thinking can we cultivate successors to the proletarian cause and build our army into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready new type of people's army. We will wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash Peng Dehuai and his so-called "regularization" to the ground, making him never able to rise again!

### 要无产阶级革命化  不要资产阶级正规化

    要无产阶级革命化  不要资产阶级正规化
    空军某部飞行副中队长　王大和  飞行员　王存周
    毛主席教导我们，人民军队的建设，要突出无产阶级政治，要首先从政治上建军。
    反革命修正主义分子彭德怀却打起“正规化”的破旗，推行资产阶级军事路线。叫嚷什么：“所谓正规化，就是把我军用条令的规格彻头彻尾地统一起来。”并把“统一训练，统一制度，统一编制，统一纪律，统一装备”作为所谓“正规化”的唯一标准。这完全是全套照搬资产阶级、修正主义的那套军事法规，妄图把我军的灵魂——战无不胜的毛泽东思想抽掉，把我军的历史经验和优良传统，三大民主，政治工作制度和群众路线等等，统统扔掉！
    我军的成长与壮大是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，绝不是靠什么“正规化”。特别是我们人民空军，是在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在陆军的基础上建立起来的。建国初期，大批当年的放牛娃，庄稼汉，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，成为优秀的飞行员，粉碎了美帝国主义“空中优势”。这难道是实行了什么所谓“正规化”的结果吗？不！这是凭突出无产阶级政治，凭指战员的无产阶级觉悟和勇敢的精神。这是毛主席政治建军路线的伟大胜利。
    彭德怀妄图从根本上否定从实践中总结出来的建设人民空军的宝贵经验。他大肆贩卖资产阶级、修正主义的破烂货，竭力片面强调武器、技术的决定作用，强调飞行理论的全面性和系统性，完全无视人的因素。按照他所谓“正规化”的要求，于是就在训练中无限制地扩大理论学科，无限制地扩大飞行练习，结果不但严重地冲击了政治，而且使学制无限地延长。他还规定了各种考试制度，叫我们整天埋头业务、技术学习。彭德怀就是这样借“正规化”之名，肆无忌惮地破坏我人民空军的建设。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    彭德怀所推行的资产阶级“正规化”是死框框，是不合乎战备需要的。我们空军战士，坚决按毛泽东思想办事。飞行员范洪潮同志，在一次训练中，意外地进入了复杂状态，高度急速下降，下面是峰峦矗立的山区，情况十分危急。这时传来跳伞的命令，按照彭德怀的所谓“正规化”的规定，遇到这种情况，范洪潮同志要立即跳伞。但是，范洪潮同志在这种生死攸关的紧急时刻，首先想到的不是个人安危，他首先想到的是：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”毛主席的教导给了他最大的勇敢和力量，沉着机智地越出了复杂状态，使这次飞行转危为安。空中飞行，特别是执行任务，情况是千变万化的，必须有勇敢精神和“灵活机动的战略战术”，才能克服困难，完成任务。如果实行彭德怀的“正规化”会给我们空军建设带来什么样的恶果，还不显而易见吗？
    毛主席的建军路线就是我军的生命线。这个“化”，那个“化”，最重要的是实现人的思想革命化；统一这，统一那，最重要的是用毛泽东思想统帅我们的一切。彭德怀“化”这，“化”那，就是不要思想革命化；他“统一”这，“统一”那，就是企图鱼目混珠，妄想把毛主席的政治建军路线“统一”掉，妄想实现他篡军的阴谋。我们决不能容忍！我们深深懂得，只有走突出无产阶级政治的道路，搞好人的思想革命化，才能培养无产阶级事业的接班人，才能把我军建设成一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的新型的人民军队。我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，把彭德怀和他的所谓“正规化”一起打翻在地，叫他永世不得翻身！
