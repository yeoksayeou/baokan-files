		To the Editor,

	After studying the extremely important editorial note and the investigative report "From the Struggle Between Two Lines at Shanghai Mechanical Institute to the Educational Revolution in Technical and Scientific Universities" in the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine, my heart is filled with excitement. The editorial note timely conveys the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, which is Chairman Mao's great concern, great encouragement, and great exhortation for us. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Ten thousand words, a million words, cannot express our loyalty as the working class to you. We sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

	I graduated from a technical secondary school in 1962 and became a worker in 1963. At that time, due to the influence of the old educational system, I couldn't accept the idea of being a worker mentally. However, with the help of worker teachers, my wrong thoughts gradually changed, and I began to take the first step on the path of combining with the workers and peasants.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants; otherwise, they will accomplish nothing." Reflecting on the past few years, whenever I seriously followed Chairman Mao's instructions, I could make progress; whenever I separated myself from the workers, I could not move forward. Not long after I started working, the factory launched a technical innovation campaign. At first, because I did not sincerely combine with the workers and peasants, I always wanted to play a "guiding role" in technology and innovate by "building a car in a closed room," resulting in failure. At this time, I reread Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectuals combining with workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's words were both a sharp criticism and the greatest concern for me. I recalled that from elementary school to graduating from technical secondary school, I was always studying with the help of the people's scholarship. The Party and Chairman Mao raised me, and the working people nurtured me. Now that I am working, if I do not listen to Chairman Mao's words and separate myself from the workers and peasants, I would be forgetting my roots. Thinking this way, I became more confident in being a student of the worker teachers and determined to become a successor of the working class.

	The worker teachers knew that I had the sincere wish to be a student and told me everything they knew. The rich experience accumulated by the workers over the years is something I could not find in books. The wisdom of the old teachers is boundless, just as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

	At the beginning, when I worked with the worker teachers on the "thousandth caliper verifier," a technician with more serious bourgeois thoughts came out to discourage me, saying: "I advise you not to touch this wall. This thing does not have any foreign resources." However, the worker teachers supported me from all sides. The worker teachers said: "We are going to touch it. Just because foreigners don't have it, does that mean we can't have it?" Hearing these words, I felt warm in my heart and received great education and encouragement. After the "thousandth caliper verifier" was made, the factory's measurement "authority" also created many obstacles. However, the old worker teacher Wang Cun, who had experienced much hardship in the old society, firmly gave the measurement "authority" a powerful rebuttal and strongly supported our innovation. Old worker teacher Sun always encouraged us, saying: "As long as you can design it, I will make it." When the work encountered difficulties, the worker teachers always took the difficulties upon themselves, fearing neither dirt nor hard work. The teachers truly care for us young workers! Workers welcome revolutionary intellectuals the most. Whether you are a university student or a technical secondary school student, as long as you are humble and determined to combine with workers and peasants, you will receive their praise.

	Although I have achieved some results with the worker teachers, I am still far from the Party's and the people's requirements. I must sincerely be a student of the working class, thoroughly change my worldview, and achieve new successes in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation!

    真心实意同工人相结合才能大步前进
    编辑同志：
    学了《红旗》杂志第三期极为重要的编者按和《从上海机械学院两条路线的斗争看理工科大学的教育革命》的调查报告后，我的心情非常激动。编者按及时传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，这是毛主席对我们的极大关怀、极大鼓舞、极大鞭策。毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语，万语千言，说不尽我们工人阶级最忠于您的心愿，让我们最最衷心地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    我是一九六二年毕业的中专生，一九六三年转为工人。当时由于受旧教育制度的毒害，对当工人从思想上想不通。但在工人师傅的帮助下，错误观点逐渐得到克服，在与工农结合的道路上开始迈出了第一步。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”。回忆这几年走过的道路，什么时候认真执行毛主席指示，就能前进；什么时候脱离了工人群众，就寸步难行。我走上工作岗位不久，工厂就开展了技术革新活动。一开始，由于我没有真心实意的与工农结合，总想自己在技术上起“指点作用”，“闭门造车”地搞革新，结果一事无成，以失败而告终。这时我重读了毛主席有关知识分子和工农相结合的教导，毛主席的话，对我既是尖锐的批评，也是最大的关怀。我回忆了自己从小学到中专毕业，都是拿着人民的助学金上学的，党和毛主席把我培养成人，劳动人民把我养大成人，如今工作了，如果不听毛主席的话，脱离了工农群众，就是忘了本。这样一想，我更增强了甘当工人师傅的小学生的信心，下决心要成为工人阶级的接班人。
    工人师傅知道我有了真心实意甘当小学生的愿望，就把他们所知道的都告诉我。工人多年来所积累的丰富经验，是我在书本上找不到的。老师傅的智慧无穷无尽，正如伟大领袖毛主席说的：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。
    开始，我与工人师傅一起搞“千分表检定器”时，一个资产阶级思想比较严重的技术员出来泼冷水说：“劝你不要碰这个壁，这东西国外还没有资料”。而工人师傅却从多方面给我支持。工人师傅说：“我们就是要碰它，难道外国没有的，我们就不能有吗！？”听了这些话，我心里感到热呼呼的，受到了很大的教育与鼓励。“千分表检定器”做成后，厂内计量“权威”又多方刁难。而在旧社会饱经风霜的工人老师傅王存，坚决给计量“权威”以有力的回击，大力支持我们的革新。老工人孙师傅总是鼓励我们说：“只要你们能设计出来，我就给做出来。”当工作一遇到困难，工人师傅总是把困难接过来自己干，不怕脏，不怕累。老师傅对我们青年工人真是关怀备至啊！工人对革命的知识分子最欢迎，不管你是大学生也好，中专生也好，只要你没架子，决心与工农结合，都能受到他们的称赞。
    我和工人师傅们在一起虽然做出了些成绩，但距离党和人民的要求还差得很远。我一定要老老实实地甘当工人阶级的小学生，彻底地改造自己的世界观，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中立新功！
