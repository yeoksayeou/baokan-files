Chairman Mao's latest instructions are inspiring the revolutionary people on the frontline against imperialism, revisionism, and foreign reactionaries to advance swiftly. The revolutionary and production situation in Xinjiang is better than ever and continues to improve.

		The mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought is flourishing throughout the entire autonomous region. The revolutionary criticism movement is burning more intensely, revolutionary unity is reaching new heights, revolutionary committees composed of three elements are emerging, military-civilian relations are becoming closer, national unity is strengthening, the dictatorship of the proletariat is consolidating, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

		Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 3rd: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the close concern of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, located on the frontline against imperialism, revisionism, and foreign reactionaries, is experiencing an unprecedentedly good revolutionary and production situation that continues to improve.

		From the foothills of the Karakoram Mountains to the Altai grasslands, from the eastern city of Hami to the Ili River Valley, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are springing up everywhere in cities and countryside, and they are becoming better and better. The revolutionary criticism movement is burning more intensely, the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing, revolutionary unity is reaching new heights, and revolutionary committees composed of three elements are emerging. Currently, most factories, mines, and enterprises in the Urumqi region have achieved revolutionary unity, and all prefectures and autonomous prefectures have reached agreements to achieve revolutionary unity and are speeding up the process. With the continuous development of the good revolutionary situation, military-civilian relations are becoming closer, national unity is strengthening, the dictatorship of the proletariat is consolidating, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

		"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang follow Chairman Mao's teaching, "Establishing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." With the enthusiastic help of the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army, they are setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. So far, the entire autonomous region has held nearly 190,000 study classes of various types. More than 70% of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and most revolutionary residents in cities have participated in the study. The revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, establish the spirit of public service in their hearts, seriously engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and effectively promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and the achievement of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. The largest modern mine in the autonomous region, No. 1 Vertical Shaft, has been at the forefront of achieving revolutionary unity among factories, mines, and enterprises in the autonomous region since mid-October last year and was the first to establish a revolutionary committee among direct-subordinate factories and mines in the autonomous region in mid-July this year. The revolutionary workers of this mine are loyal to Chairman Mao and follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, setting a model for promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in the autonomous region.

		The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "One of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," are using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out an in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. In workshops, fields, pastures, classrooms, and offices, revolutionary battlefields are set up everywhere, and some revolutionary families have set up revolutionary criticism columns, deeply criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Xinjiang, exposing their various counter-revolutionary conspiracies. In conjunction with the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, rooting out a handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries, and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

		The fiery revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang often express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao on the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. They say, "Chairman Mao's words are forever in our hearts, and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will forever march on the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao."

		The unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, the deepening of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the great victory of the Cultural Revolution have greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking and the flourishing development of industrial and agricultural production throughout the region. In the first half of this year, the production of coal, oil, steel, steel products, pig iron, cotton yarn, and cloth in factories, mines, and enterprises directly under the autonomous region, as well as the electricity generated, all increased significantly compared to the second half of last year. The production in July was significantly higher than the average monthly production in the first half of the year, and the production in August was significantly higher than in July. The main products of oil production have exceeded the production plan for seven consecutive months, and coal production not only meets the needs of the autonomous region but also supports brother provinces and regions. Railway transportation has exceeded the plan every month since March this year, and road transportation is also good, ensuring the transportation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, industrial and agricultural production, national defense construction, and people's livelihood supplies. The production situation in agriculture and animal husbandry is also good. This year is the year with the most offspring in animal husbandry since the liberation of the autonomous region, and the survival rate is also high. In the face of severe drought last year and drought and lack of rain this year, the members of all ethnic groups, with the help of the PLA, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply carried out the mass movement of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," broken the ice to lead water, dug wells to draw water, improved irrigation methods, and fought tenaciously against the rare drought, finally achieving a good harvest of summer grain. The autumn crops are full and strong, and the growth is much better than last year.

		Under the great call of Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," the PLA units stationed in Xinjiang and the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps have taken on the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries," making great achievements for the Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang.

		The revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are determined to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and increase revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold. They will further strengthen military-civilian unity and national unity, be ready at any time to smash all sabotage activities by domestic and foreign class enemies. At the same time, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they will further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and build the northwestern border of the motherland into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought and an iron Great Wall.

    毛主席一系列最新指示鼓舞着反帝反修反对外国反动派前哨的革命人民飞速前进
    新疆革命生产形势空前大好越来越好
    全自治区活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃发展，革命大批判烈火越烧越旺，革命大联合出现新高潮，三结合的革命委员会联翩出现，军民关系更加紧密，民族团结进一步增强，无产阶级专政更加巩固，工农业生产欣欣向荣。
    新华社乌鲁木齐三日电　在各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，地处反帝、反修、反对外国反动派前哨的新疆维吾尔自治区，革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    从喀喇昆仑山麓到阿尔泰草原，从东疆重镇哈密到伊犁河谷，毛泽东思想学习班遍布城乡，越办越好。全自治区革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃发展，革命大联合出现了新的高潮，三结合的革命委员会联翩出现。目前，乌鲁木齐地区绝大部分厂矿企业实现了革命大联合，各专区、自治州也都达成了实现革命大联合的协议，正在加快步伐实现革命大联合。随着大好革命形势的不断发展，军民关系更加亲密，民族团结进一步增强，无产阶级专政更加巩固，工农业生产欣欣向荣。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”新疆各族革命人民遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在人民解放军广大指战员的热情帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。到目前为止，全自治区已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班十九万多期，全新疆百分之七十以上的工人、贫下中农、革命师生、革命干部、革命知识分子，以及城镇的大部分革命居民，都参加了学习。各族革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，在灵魂深处大立一个“公”字，认真斗私批修，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。自治区最大的现代化矿井——一号立井广大革命煤矿职工，从去年十月中旬以来，一直坚持开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，在自治区厂矿企业中一马当先实现了革命大联合，并于今年七月中旬在自治区直属厂矿中第一个建立了革命委员会。这个煤矿革命职工忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的模范行动，对推动自治区的革命大联合和革命三结合起了良好的作用。
    新疆各族革命人民，遵照毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展了革命大批判。在车间、地头、牧场、课堂、机关，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，一些革命群众的家庭也办起了革命大批判专栏，深刻批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新疆代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，揭露他们的各种反革命阴谋活动。结合革命大批判，各族革命人民向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，把一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子挖了出来，加强了无产阶级专政。
    如火如荼的革命大批判，极大地提高了各族革命人民的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。新疆各族革命人民经常在革命大批判的战场上表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心。他们说，毛主席的话永远记在我们的心坎上，新疆各族人民永远奔驰在毛主席指引的社会主义大道上。
    毛泽东思想的空前大普及，毛主席革命路线的深入人心，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，大大促进了人的思想革命化，促进了全疆工农业生产的蓬勃发展。今年上半年，全自治区直属厂矿企业生产的煤炭、石油、钢、钢材、生铁、棉纱和布匹的产量以及发电量，比去年下半年都有大幅度增长，七月份的产量又比今年上半年的平均月产量大幅度增产，八月份比七月份又有显著上升。石油生产方面的主要产品已连续七个月超额完成生产计划，煤炭生产不仅满足了自治区需要，还支援了兄弟省区。铁路运输从今年三月份以来月月超额完成计划，公路运输情况也较好，保证了发行毛主席的革命宝书、工农业生产、国防建设以及人民生活物资等运输的需要。农牧业生产形势也很好。今年是自治区解放以来畜牧业产仔最多的一年，成活率也很高。农业生产在去年严重干旱，今年又干旱缺雨的情况下，各族社员在解放军的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，破冰引水，打井提水，改进灌溉方法，同罕见的干旱进行顽强的斗争，终于夺得了夏粮较好的收成。秋季作物苗全苗壮，长势大大胜过去年。
    在毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召下，人民解放军驻新疆部队和新疆军区生产建设兵团担负起了“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，为新疆的无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的成绩。
    新疆各族革命群众决心紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍提高革命警惕，进一步加强军民团结，加强民族团结，随时准备粉碎国内外阶级敌人的一切破坏活动。同时，要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把祖国西北边疆办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，建成坚不可摧的钢铁长城。
