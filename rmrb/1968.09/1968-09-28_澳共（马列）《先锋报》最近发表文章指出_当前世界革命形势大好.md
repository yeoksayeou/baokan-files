	The Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) organ, the "Vanguard," published an article on September 25, pointing out that the current world revolutionary situation is excellent.

	The article says that the incident of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique invading Czechoslovakia has made it very clear that the revisionist leaders in the Kremlin and U.S. imperialism are collaborating to dominate the world. It has made more and more people realize the necessity of strengthening the struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique and against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism.

	The article says that the great Communist Party of China, led by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, stands at the forefront of the world's struggle against revisionism and imperialism. China is the beacon of the world's revolutionary people.

	The article points out that in Europe, under the leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, Albania is a beacon of socialism. Although Albania is a small country, it has a towering image. It holds a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, fearing neither the "sabre-rattling" of the likes of Khrushchev.

	The article points out that the great victory of the heroic people of South Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has confirmed the correctness of Chairman Mao's theory of people's war. The heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people is defeating the U.S. aggression.

	The article says that the struggle against modern revisionism within China has entered a new stage with the establishment of revolutionary committees across the country. The Khrushchevites in China have been defeated. This is a great blow to the imperialists.

	The article points out that the struggle against revisionism in Europe has intensified. Various revisionist groups are collapsing. In various capitalist countries, Marxist-Leninist organizations are growing stronger in the class struggle and in the fight against revisionists.

	The article concludes by saying that the world revolutionary movement has entered a new stage. The days of the imperialists and their modern revisionist accomplices are numbered.

    新华社墨尔本二十五日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》二十五日发表文章，指出当前世界革命形势大好。
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团入侵捷克斯洛伐克这件事已经十分清楚地表明，克里姆林宫的修正主义头子和美帝国主义合作妄图主宰世界。它使越来越多的人认识到，加强反对以苏修集团为首的现代修正主义和反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争的必要性。
    文章说，以天才的毛泽东同志为首的伟大的中国共产党，站在全世界反对修正主义和帝国主义的斗争的前列。中国是世界革命人民的灯塔。
    文章指出，在欧洲，在杰出的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志领导下的阿尔巴尼亚，是社会主义的明灯。阿尔巴尼亚虽然是一个小国，但是有着高大的形象。她“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”，不怕“耀武扬威”的赫鲁晓夫之流。
    文章指出，英雄的越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利，证实了毛主席关于人民战争的学说的正确性。越南南方人民的英勇斗争，正在打败美国的侵略。
    文章说，中国国内反对现代修正主义的斗争，随着全国各地的革命委员会的建立，已经进入了一个新阶段。中国的赫鲁晓夫分子已经被打垮了。这是对帝国主义者的一个巨大的打击。
    文章指出，在欧洲，反对修正主义的斗争已经加强了。各个修正主义集团正在土崩瓦解。在各个资本主义国家中，马克思列宁主义的组织在阶级斗争的战场上，在反对修正主义者的战斗中更加壮大了。
    文章最后说，世界革命运动已经进入了一个新阶段。帝国主义者及其同伙现代修正主义者的寿命已经不长了。
