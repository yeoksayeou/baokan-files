Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has profoundly pointed out: "We should select students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." Combining our more than one year of practice in carrying out the education revolution, we have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, deeply feeling that Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is the beacon guiding us in carrying out the proletarian education revolution, and is also a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly reforming the old medical education system. The more we study, the more intimate it feels, and the clearer our minds become.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of our school, following the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "revolutionize education" and "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," formed a team of five students who graduated in 1966 and five revolutionary young teachers to explore the education revolution. With the determination to carry the proletarian education revolution to the end, we went deep into the mountainous area of Huangchuan County in the south of Henan Province, and with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, started from scratch to establish a new type of school—the Dabie Mountain Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School. Over the past more than a year, the local poor and lower-middle peasants and we have, following Chairman Mao's directive of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," made some explorations in the education revolution of medical colleges and trained a batch of rural doctors who are warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, the first batch of 64 students has graduated, and the second batch of 72 students is currently studying.

When we first established the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School, we first considered the question of selecting what kind of students and training what kind of people. This is a major issue concerning whose hands the medical and health power of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants will fall into. We resolutely abolished the old enrollment system and methods, relying on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to select the rural youths and grassroots health workers they trust most to enroll. The first batch selected 64 students, of whom 61 are active members in studying Chairman Mao's works. They are all from poor and lower-middle peasant families, and many of them had relatives who fled famine, begged for food, sold children, and even were sold themselves in the old society, having a bitter family history and background. Student Wang Dachang even brought his own indenture contract to school. Therefore, they have clear study goals, can study with problems in mind, learn effectively, and apply what they learn actively.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, has always, under the direct help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, placed the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and promoting the thought revolution of teachers and students at the forefront of all work. The first lesson of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School was not anatomy or physiology, but organizing the entire school's teachers and students to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," criticize and repudiate selfishness and revise public opinion, and establish the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University persist in taking class struggle as the key link, carrying out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, visit the poor and inquire about hardships. At the same time, they continuously carry out a thorough exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School have always regarded participating in collective productive labor as an important course. Teachers and students themselves build houses, make blackboards, fetch firewood, and plant vegetables, and implement the "three together" with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through these activities, these good successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants maintain the character of the working people and temper the working style of connecting with the masses.

In the process of formulating the teaching plan, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School has always insisted on political leadership over business, seriously implementing the policy of "combining theory with practice." It organizes teachers to go deep into the masses, investigate the social economy, production, and living conditions of the countryside, the level of medical and health care, and the situation of common and prevalent diseases. According to the urgent needs and actual situation of the masses, it formulates a teaching plan and then discusses and modifies it with the students. The main content of the teaching materials is based on common and prevalent diseases and commonly used techniques. According to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "studying is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning," it emphasizes some general theoretical knowledge and focuses on learning in practice. According to the requirements of the local poor and lower-middle peasants and the needs of seasonal disease prevention and treatment, teachers and students set up clinics and organized mobile medical teams to carry out practical activities. In three months, teachers and students treated more than 16,000 poor and lower-middle peasants from 13 counties and cities, performed eye surgeries for more than 2,500 people, and restored vision to more than 100 blind people. Students learn while treating patients, rising from sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, and then taking rational knowledge to practice for verification. Through repeated cycles, students' level improves with each cycle. Taking ophthalmology as an example, in a short period, all 64 students in the school learned the surgery to treat "trichiasis," and some students even mastered the surgery method to treat strabismus. These are things that students of our school could not achieve in three years in the past. Last year, a batch of students was assigned to Huainan County People's Hospital for internship. Due to the capitalist roaders inciting the masses to fight against the masses, most of the staff left their posts. Under these circumstances, the 12 students who were interned there and some staff who remained in the hospital insisted on working, and the medical tasks of the entire hospital were completed very well.

Our revolutionary practice of establishing the Dabie Mountain Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Medical School makes us deeply feel that only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we turn our school into a university that meets the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and train students who firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have a clear class stand, love and hate clearly, are selfless, serve the people wholeheartedly, breathe and share the fate with workers and peasants, have both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, and truly become "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

    听毛主席的话
    培养为贫下中农服务的新型医疗卫生队伍
    豫北医专革命委员会
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”我们结合一年多来进行教育革命的实践，反复学习了毛主席的这一光辉指示，深深体会到毛主席这一光辉指示是指引我们进行无产阶级教育革命的灯塔，也是指引我们彻底改革旧的医学教育制度的强大思想武器。我们越学越亲切，越学心里越亮堂。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我校革命师生遵照伟大领袖毛主席“教育要革命”“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，由五名一九六六年毕业的学生和五名革命的青年教师组成一支教育革命探索队，抱着把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的决心，深入豫南山区潢川县双柳公社，在贫下中农的帮助下，白手起家，创办了一所新型学校——大别山抗大医校。一年多来，当地贫下中农和我们一起，遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的办学方针，在医学院校教育革命方面作了一些探索，培训了一批深受贫下中农欢迎的农村医生。现在，第一批六十四名学员已经结业，第二批七十二名学员正在学习。
    开始创办抗大医校时，我们首先考虑的是选拔什么样的学员，培养什么样的人的问题。这是关系到广大贫下中农的医疗卫生大权将要落到谁手里的重大问题。我们坚决废除了旧的招生制度和方法，依靠广大贫下中农选拔他们最信任的农村青年和基层卫生员入学。第一届选拔了六十四名学员入学，其中六十一名是学习毛主席著作积极分子。他们都是贫下中农出身，其中有不少人的亲人在旧社会逃过荒要过饭，卖过儿卖过女，甚至自己被卖过身，在旧社会有着苦难的家史和身世。学员王大昌就是带着自己的卖身契来上学的。所以，他们学习目的明确，能带着问题学，学得进，用得活。
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”抗大医校遵照毛主席的伟大教导，在贫下中农的直接帮助下，一直把活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、促进师生思想革命化放在一切工作的首位。抗大医校的第一课不是上解剖学、生理学，而是组织全校师生活学活用毛主席著作，大学“老三篇”，斗私批修，破私立公，树立全心全意为人民服务的观点。抗大革命师生坚持以阶级斗争为纲，开展忆苦思甜、访贫问苦活动。同时，不断地开展对中国赫鲁晓夫的大揭发，大批判，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    抗大医校的革命师生还始终把参加集体生产劳动列为一项重要课程。师生们自己动手修房子、泥黑板、拉烧柴、种蔬菜，并且和贫下中农实行“三同”。通过这些活动，使这些贫下中农的好后代，保持劳动人民的本色，锻炼联系群众的工作作风。
    抗大医校在制订教学计划的过程中，始终坚持政治统帅业务，认真贯彻执行“理论和实际结合”的方针。组织教师深入群众，调查农村的社会经济、生产、生活状况，医疗卫生水平，以及当地常见病多发病的情况。根据群众的迫切要求和实际情况制订教学计划，然后交给学员讨论修改。编写教材，主要是以常见病多发病和常用技术为主。根据毛主席“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”的伟大教导，有重点地讲些一般理论知识，着重于在实践中学习。根据当地贫下中农的要求和季节性疾病防治的需要，师生开设了门诊，并组织了巡回医疗队，进行实践活动。在三个月内，师生共为十三个县、市的贫下中农诊治了一万六千多人次，为二千五百多人作了眼科手术，使一百多位盲人重见了光明。学员边看病边学习，从感性认识上升到理性认识，然后再把理性认识拿到实践中去检验，这样多次反复，学员的水平一次比一次提高。仅以眼科为例，在短时间内，全校六十四名学员都学会了治疗“倒睫”的手术，一部分学员还掌握了治疗斜视的手术方法。这些都是过去我校学生在三年的时间内所做不到的。去年一批学员被分配到淮滨县人民医院实习，这个医院由于走资派挑动群众斗群众，大部分职工离开了工作岗位，在这种情况下，在那里实习的十二名学员和留在医院的部分职工坚持工作，全院医疗任务完成得很好。
    我们创办大别山抗大医校的革命实践，使我们深刻体会到：只有坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能把我们的学校办成工农兵需要的大学，才能培养出高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、阶级立场坚定、爱憎分明、大公无私、全心全意为人民服务的学生，才能培养出和工农兵同呼吸、共命运的学生，才能培养出既有理论又有实践经验的学生，使学生真正成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
