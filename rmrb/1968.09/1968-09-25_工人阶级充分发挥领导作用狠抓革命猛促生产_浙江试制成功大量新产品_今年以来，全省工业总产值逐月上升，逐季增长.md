Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class in Zhejiang Province has fully exerted its leading role, firmly grasped class struggle, and carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. By promoting revolution to drive production, the revolutionary and production situation on the industrial front in the entire province has become increasingly better.

Since this year, the total industrial output value of Zhejiang Province has been rising month by month and growing quarter by quarter. The output in August increased by 2.5% compared to July. Among industrial products, heavy industry, metallurgy, and products supporting agriculture have seen the largest growth. Pig iron production in August increased by 37.5% compared to July, coal by 17.1%, and calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer more than doubled. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, rubber shoes, and thermos bottles have also seen significant increases.

A prominent feature of the good revolutionary and production situation on Zhejiang's industrial front is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has driven the industrial technological revolution to develop rapidly. Broad masses of revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They have deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, thoroughly smashed foreign dogmas and old frameworks, and closely combined revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have further displayed their boundless wisdom and creativity, driving the technological revolution and technological innovation mass movement forward. In recent months, the industrial front in the entire province has successfully developed tens of thousands of new products. Many new products have reached or surpassed national and international advanced levels. The Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory has successfully created two types of precision surface grinders at the world's advanced level in the past year. The parts machined with these two types of grinders have a surface smoothness that reaches the highest international standard. The successful development of these two types of grinders has filled a gap in China's machine tool products. The Hangzhou Automobile Engine Factory has successfully developed a diesel engine for automobiles with an international advanced level. This engine has high horsepower, small volume, light weight, high precision, low fuel consumption, and can start normally in temperatures as low as minus forty degrees Celsius. The Hangzhou Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory created a semiconductor photoelectric warp detector in just one and a half months, making a new contribution to the electrification and automation of China's silk industry.

Currently, the revolutionary committees of various industrial and mining enterprises in Zhejiang Province are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out extensive criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable rules and regulations, transfer office personnel to the front lines, and go through several stages such as struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories." They are rapidly launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    工人阶级充分发挥领导作用狠抓革命猛促生产
    浙江试制成功大量新产品
    今年以来，全省工业总产值逐月上升，逐季增长
    据新华社杭州二十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，浙江省工人阶级充分发挥领导阶级的作用，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以革命推动生产，全省工业战线革命和生产形势越来越好。
    今年以来，浙江全省工业总产值逐月上升，逐季增长。八月份比七月增长百分之二点五。工业产品中重工业、冶金工业和支援农业的产品增长幅度最大，生铁八月比七月增长百分之三十七点五，煤增长百分之十七点一，钙镁磷肥增长一倍多。肥皂、火柴、胶鞋、热水瓶等日用品也显著增长。
    浙江省工业战线革命生产形势大好的一个突出的特点，就是无产阶级文化大革命推动工业的技术革命迅猛发展。广大革命工人、革命技术人员和革命干部，认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货，大破洋教条、旧框框，同时把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来。通过革命的大批判，广大革命工人进一步发挥出无穷的聪明才智和创造力，推动了技术革命和技术革新群众运动的发展。几个月来，全省工业战线试制成功了成千上万种新产品，许多新产品达到或者超过全国和国际的先进水平。杭州机床厂去年以来，连续创造成功两种达到世界先进水平的精密平面磨床，用这两种磨床加工出来的零部件，表平面光洁度，达到国际最高标准。这两种磨床的试制成功，填补了我国机床产品中的一个空白点。杭州汽车发动机厂试制成功了具有国际先进水平的汽车柴油发动机，这种发动机马力大、体积小、重量轻、精度高、耗油省，能够在零下四十度左右的严寒气温下正常起动。杭州纺织机械制造厂只用短短一个半月时间，就创造出半导体光电探纬装置，为我国丝绸工业的电气化、自动化作出了新的贡献。
    目前，浙江省各地工矿企业的革命委员会正在认真落实毛主席的最新指示：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”迅速掀起斗、批、改的高潮。
