The brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line points the way, sweeping away all monsters and demons!

One evening, a man who performed Peking opera came to the train station waiting room. Seeing that there were many people waiting for the train, he maliciously started a performance, singing a segment from the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Shajiabang." However, instead of singing the revolutionary heroes Alqing, Grandma Sha, and Guo Jian, he focused on singing the villainous characters Hu Shiling and Xiao Deyi. As he sang and performed, he amused the crowd, who burst into laughter. After finishing, he still felt unsatisfied and started singing from the beginning again.

A new soldier from the railway protection unit, Gao Mingliang, saw this and thought: "In 'Shajiabang,' isn't there a sharp confrontation between the positive character Alqing and the negative character Xiao Deyi? Why is this person only promoting the negative character Xiao Deyi?" He analyzed the situation using Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and felt that there was a struggle over the line. He thought: "Comrade Jiang Qing, following Chairman Mao's literary line, established revolutionary model operas to bring the historical protagonists, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, onto the stage. But this person removes the heroic image of the revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers and only performs the ugly figures of Hu Shiling and Xiao Deyi. Isn't this using the name of performing modern revolutionary model operas to peddle reactionary bourgeois evil thoughts? We must strike back at this person who is waving the 'red flag' to oppose the red flag!"

Thinking this, Gao Mingliang rushed back to his dormitory, took out his wooden clapper, and started a performance in the waiting room. As the man sang Xiao Deyi on the other side, Gao Mingliang sang the "Three Articles" in the style of Yu opera. The passengers saw the soldier performing the brilliant "Three Articles" and enthusiastically applauded and cheered, making the man singing Xiao Deyi lose face. Under the illumination of the brilliant thoughts of the "Three Articles," the revolutionary masses stood up one after another to criticize the person singing Xiao Deyi as spreading poison! Everyone shouted slogans: Down with the Chinese Khrushchev! Down with the monsters and demons! Down with Xiao Deyi! Under the fierce denunciation of the broad revolutionary masses, the man who sang Xiao Deyi slinked away in defeat.

Later, the revolutionary masses reported to Gao Mingliang that the person who specialized in singing Xiao Deyi was a class enemy who had been purged from a Peking opera troupe.

    一场针锋相对的斗争
    解放军战士　魏轩东　鲁兵
    毛泽东思想光芒万丈，亿万军民心明眼亮，毛主席革命路线指方向，牛鬼蛇神全扫光！
    一天傍晚，车站候车室来了个唱京剧的。他见等车的人很多，就不安好心地开了一个场，唱起革命现代京剧样板戏《沙家浜》的一段。但是他不唱革命英雄人物阿庆嫂、沙奶奶和郭建光，却专唱胡司令、刁德一两个反面人物。他唱着演着，逗得大家哄堂大笑。他唱完还觉得不过瘾，就又从头唱。
    护路部队的新战士高明亮看到这种情况，心里想：《沙家浜》里不是正面人物阿庆嫂和反面人物刁德一针锋相对地斗争吗？为什么这人只宣传反面人物刁德一呢？他用毛主席的革命路线一分析，觉得这里有路线斗争。他想：敬爱的江青同志按照毛主席的文艺路线树立革命样板戏，就是让历史的主人工农兵登上舞台，而这个人却抽掉革命工农兵的高大英雄形象，只表演胡司令和刁德一两个丑象，这不是借演现代革命样板戏之名、行贩卖反动的资产阶级丑恶思想之实吗？对这个打着“红旗”反红旗的人物必须迎头痛击！
    想到这儿，高明亮就跑回宿舍，取来呱哒板，在候车室把竹板一打，也开了一个场。
    那个人在那边唱刁德一，高明亮就在这边唱豫剧曲调“老三篇”。旅客群众见解放军演唱光辉的“老三篇”，都热烈鼓掌助威，把那边唱刁德一的晒了台。在“老三篇”光辉思想照耀下，革命群众纷纷起来批判唱刁德一的人是放毒！大家高喊口号：打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！打倒牛鬼蛇神！打倒刁德一！在广大革命群众的愤怒声讨下，那个唱刁德一的人灰溜溜地逃走了。
    事后革命群众向高明亮反映，这个专唱刁德一的人是一个京剧院被清理出来的阶级异己分子。
