On the night of September 11, the radio broadcast the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants of our Men Tie Camp Brigade were deeply moved upon hearing this. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your words truly resonate with the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants genuinely welcome those intellectuals who combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Over the past few years, our Men Tie Camp Brigade has had over fifty high school and junior high school graduates return from school. Most of these are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. When they first entered school, they were all quite humble. After a few years of schooling, however, they became spoiled. In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were mostly illiterate. In the new society, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants have the opportunity to go to school. How could we not be happy? However, the students who returned from school were still the same people, but they had less of the spirit of the working class. Some of them were no longer like the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. We were both angry and resentful, angry that they did not uphold the dignity of poor and lower-middle peasants, and resentful that the school had corrupted the children. At that time, we were very anxious. Chairman Mao taught us, "Class struggle, once grasped, is all-powerful." Our brigade leadership organized them to study the works of Chairman Mao, and we, the older generation of poor and lower-middle peasants, recounted the bitterness of the old society and the tragic lives of the poor and oppressed under the old system, giving them a deep class education.

While recalling the bitterness of the old society, we, the older generation of poor and lower-middle peasants, led them to the front lines of class struggle and production struggle for practical training. Over the past few years, based on the actual situation of our brigade, it has been completely as our great leader Chairman Mao taught: "Those who have been educated in the old schools, the majority or a large majority, can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers." We have seen them gradually shed the things they brought from the old schools, and their spirit of the working class has grown day by day. We encourage and welcome every small progress they make. Because of this, the more than fifty young people who returned have mostly become the backbone of class struggle and production struggle. In the class struggle, facing the vicious class enemies, they remain calm and steadfast, becoming the vanguards in defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; in the production struggle, they work hard, and are reliable helpers of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The educated youth Jiang Yushan, when he first returned from school, looked down on labor and was not settled. After education, he gradually became a production expert. Last winter, during the wheat irrigation, the water pump valve under the ice layer malfunctioned, and people were at a loss. Jiang Yushan, this young man, broke the ice, took off his cotton clothes, and shouted, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He dove in. After he fixed the water pump valve, his body was covered with red and purple marks from the ice shards. Another student, Zhang Diankui, when he first returned to the village, said, "A middle school student returning to the countryside is like using a high-powered gun to shoot a mosquito, a waste of talent, studying for more than ten years to come back and repair the earth, no future." Later, after studying and with our help, he also became a prominent revolutionary and production vanguard in the village.

Seeing these young people improve, we let them take on the responsibility of building socialism. We let them be militia instructors, platoon leaders, squad leaders, production team leaders, accountants, and let them hold the seal for the poor and lower-middle peasants. To be honest, those intellectuals who truly combine with us poor and lower-middle peasants and follow Chairman Mao in revolution, we genuinely love them with all our hearts.

    和工农兵结合得好的后生俺贫下中农打心眼里爱
    编辑同志：
    九月十一日夜里，从广播里传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。我们门铁营大队的贫下中农听了十分激动。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家的话，真是说到了俺贫下中农的心里了。俺贫下中农对和工农兵结合在一起的知识分子，打心眼里是欢迎的。
    几年来，我们门铁营大队从学校回来的高、初中毕业生就有五十多人。这些人大都是贫下中农的子弟。他们才进学校的时候，都很朴实。上了几年学回来，却变娇了。我们贫下中农在旧社会大都是睁眼瞎子。在新社会，有伟大领袖毛主席领导，贫下中农的后代有了上学的机会，我们怎能不高兴啊！可是，从学校回来的学生，人还是那个人，劳动人民的气味少多了。有的简直不象贫下中农子弟了。我们见了又气又恨，气他们不给贫下中农作脸，恨学校把孩子给教坏了。当时我们心里很着急。毛主席教导说：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”我们大队领导就组织他们学习毛主席著作，由我们这些老一代的贫下中农给他们忆旧社会的苦，讲旧社会穷人挨剥削、受压迫的悲惨生活，使他们受到了深刻的阶级教育。
    在忆旧社会苦的同时，我们这些老一代的贫下中农，带着他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争的第一线实地锻炼。几年来，从我们大队的实际情况看，完全象伟大领袖毛主席教导的那样：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的”。我们眼看着他们身上从旧学校带来的那些东西渐渐地少了，劳动人民的气味一天天地多起来。对他们每一个微小的进步，我们都鼓励，都欢迎。正由于这样，回来的这五十多个青年，大多数都成了阶级斗争、生产斗争的骨干力量。在阶级斗争中，面对着凶恶的阶级敌人，他们面不改色心不跳，成了保卫毛主席、捍卫毛泽东思想、捍卫毛主席革命路线的闯将；他们在生产斗争中，泥一把，汗一把，是我们贫下中农靠得住的帮手。知识青年姜玉坡，才由学校回村的时候，看不起劳动，一直不安心。经过教育，他们渐渐地变成了生产能手。去年冬天浇麦时，冻在冰层下边的水泵龙头出了毛病，人们正急得没办法，姜玉坡这个小伙子，砸开冰，脱下棉衣，高喊着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一头就扎下去。当他把水泵龙头的故障排除后，身上被冰碴扎得红一道紫一道的。另一个中学生张殿奎，才回村时，说什么：“中学生回乡，是高射炮打蚊子，大材小用，上了十来年学回来修理地球，没出息。”后来，经过学习和我们帮助，也成了全村数得着的革命和生产的闯将。
    我们看着这些青年变好了，就让他们学着担建设社会主义的担子。让他们当民兵指导员、连长、排长和生产队长、会计等，让他们为贫下中农掌大印。说实在的，真正和俺贫下中农一个心眼跟着毛主席干革命的知识分子，我们真是手里捧心里爱。
