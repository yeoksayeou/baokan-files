Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province have been universally established.

At present, a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation led by the working class and participated in by the broad revolutionary masses is surging across the entire province. With the development of the revolutionary situation, the industrial and agricultural production situation in the entire province is excellent and getting better and better.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 13th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province have been universally established in the midst of the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. At present, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the revolutionary people of the entire province are advancing with an irresistible momentum, sweeping across the entire province in a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is unprecedentedly excellent and getting better and better.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is called the Revolutionary Committee." Since the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee half a year ago, it has followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and a series of latest instructions, firmly grasped the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and promoted the continuous development of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. So far, all ten administrative regions, prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and 106 counties under the province have established revolutionary committees. Ninety-eight percent of the people's communes in the province have also established revolutionary committees. Every day, revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership organs are established in large numbers in the industrial systems of Guangzhou City and various prefectures. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The universal establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province declares the complete failure of the plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu and his agents in Guangdong, Zhao Ziyang, to restore capitalism at the southern gate of the motherland.

At present, the situation in Guangdong Province is excellent. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are universally held, with over 36 million people participating in study classes across the province. Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popularized, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are quickly implemented. The revolutionary people of the entire province are closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and bravely fighting for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The experience of seizing power with Mao Zedong Thought by the revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province is becoming richer and richer, and they have become strong battle command centers leading the revolutionary people to advance victoriously, fully demonstrating the strong vitality of the new proletarian revolutionary power. At the second plenary session of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, commissioners and representatives from various regions, cities, and counties summarized the experience of seizing power with Mao Zedong Thought. They deeply realized that following the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters is victory. Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented immediately and resolutely, understood or not understood, and deepened understanding in the process of implementation. Under the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unity of thought, unity of steps, and unity of action must be achieved.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Establish revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination, carry out a great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office personnel, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and transformation generally go through these stages." At present, with the universal establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province, a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation led by the working class and participated in by the broad revolutionary masses is surging across the entire province. The revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong Province, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," are organizing the vast army of industrial workers in an organized and step-by-step manner, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to advance into schools and other units that have not yet carried out struggle, criticism, and transformation. Wherever the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought goes, the revolutionary situation there presents a thriving scene. Recently, the schools and other units where the Guangzhou City Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have been stationed have universally presented an inspiring situation.

With the development of the revolutionary situation, the industrial and agricultural production situation in the entire province is also excellent and getting better and better. The working class resolutely implements Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and fiercely criticizes the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises by the Chinese Khrushchev, making the industrial production in the entire province flourish. New designs, new technologies, new products, new equipment, and new tools are constantly emerging, and the production and quality of many important products are steadily improving. In the countryside, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, after being tempered by the Cultural Revolution, have a completely new appearance. The counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "self-reliance, self-management, and self-determination" and "material incentives," have been thoroughly criticized, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have further established the idea of farming for revolution. This year's early rice crop, after overcoming the severe natural disasters of low temperatures, floods, pests, and droughts, has achieved a good harvest.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下乘胜前进
    广东省各级革命委员会普遍建立
    目前，一个由工人阶级领导的、有广大革命群众参加的斗批改高潮，正在全省范围内兴起。随着革命形势的发展，全省工农业生产形势一片大好，越来越好
    新华社广州十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，广东省各级革命委员会，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，普遍建立起来。现在，全省革命人民在各级革命委员会的领导下，正以排山倒海之势，在全省范围内掀起斗、批、改高潮。全省革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”广东省革命委员会成立半年多来，遵照毛主席这一伟大教导和一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，推动革命大联合和革命三结合的不断发展。到目前为止，全省所属十个行政区、专区、自治州、市和一百零六个县，全部建立了革命委员会。全省百分之九十八的人民公社也已建立起了革命委员会。广州市和各专区工业系统每天都有大批革命三结合的领导机构建立起来。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。广东省各级革命委员会的普遍建立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东的代理人赵紫阳之流妄图在祖国南大门复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产。
    目前，广东全省形势大好。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班普遍举办，全省参加学习班的人数达三千六百多万人。毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速落实。全省革命人民紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，在省革委会的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而英勇战斗。
    广东省各级革命委员会用毛泽东思想掌权的经验越来越丰富，已经成为带领革命人民胜利前进的坚强的战斗指挥部，充分显示出新生的无产阶级革命政权的强大生命力。在广东省革命委员会第二次全体委员扩大会议上，来自各地区、各市、县的委员和代表，总结了用毛泽东思想掌权的经验。他们深刻地认识到，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟无产阶级司令部，就是胜利。对伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，一定要闻风而动，雷厉风行，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中不断加深理解。必须在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”目前，广东省随着各级革命委员会的普遍建立，一个由工人阶级领导的、有广大革命群众参加的斗、批、改高潮，正在全省范围内兴起。广东省各级革命委员会根据毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，有领导、有步骤地组织浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军，配合解放军战士，开进学校和其他一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级队伍开到那里，那里的革命形势就出现蓬勃发展的大好景象。最近以来，广州市工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻的学校和其他单位，普遍出现了令人鼓舞的局面。
    随着革命形势的发展，广东全省工农业生产形势也是一片大好，越来越好。工人阶级坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线，使全省工业生产蒸蒸日上，新设计、新工艺、新产品、新设备、新工具不断出现，很多重要产品的产量和质量都稳步提高。在农村，广大贫下中农经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，精神面貌焕然一新。中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，受到彻底批判，广大贫下中农进一步树立起为革命种田的思想。今年早造，在战胜了低温、洪水、病虫、干旱等严重的自然灾害后，取得了好收成。
