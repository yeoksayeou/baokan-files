Under Mobutu's reactionary rule, hyperinflation has led to skyrocketing prices. The main staple food of the Congolese (Zaire) people, cassava, has risen from one zaire per sack a year ago to three zaire per sack by May of this year. Rice has increased from three and a half zaire per sack to eight zaire per sack. A single slice of bread has gone from five makuta (one hundred makuta equals one zaire) to forty makuta. The price of meat has surged from forty makuta per kilogram to one zaire per kilogram.

    物价飞涨钞票跌价
    在蒙博托的反动统治下，通货膨胀，物价飞涨。刚果（金）广大穷苦人民的主要粮食木薯，由一年前的一个宰里一袋涨到今年五月的三个宰里一袋；大米每袋由三个半宰里涨到八个宰里；面包一片由五个玛古塔（一百个玛古塔等于一个宰里）涨到四十个玛古塔；肉一公斤由四十个玛古塔涨到一个宰里。
