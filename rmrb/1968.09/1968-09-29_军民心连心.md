There is such a scene:

Yang Zhirong stands in the home of hunter Lao Chang, listening to Chang Baozhi's heart-wrenching account of her family's tragic experiences. Every word and tear tells of the bandits' crimes, stirring up a sea of hatred. He looks at Xiao Changbao, his eyes filled with deep affection and confidence. What is he thinking? From the Chang family's ordeal, he sees that "all oppressed people under heaven have a ledger of blood and tears," deeply aware of the heavy responsibility he bears. He is determined to "seek revenge, to right the wrongs, and repay blood with blood." To overthrow the dark old society and liberate all of China, he sings with a heart full of victory: "Eliminate Seatop Tiger, the people gain liberation, stand up as masters, the deep mountains see the sun. From now on, follow the savior Communist Party, and make the mountains and rivers change their appearance." This heartfelt voice tightly binds the hearts of the people's army and the people, vividly and truly expressing the deep proletarian feelings between the military and the civilians.

Hunter Lao Chang, for the first time in his life, hears Yang Zhirong's words and is deeply moved, saying, "Old Yang, these words hit the mark." Yes, Yang Zhirong's words resonate with the hearts of all oppressed people under heaven.

Yang Zhirong, since he "found the Communist Party and took the revolutionary path," has sworn to "uproot the source of exploitation" and "open the fountain of eternal happiness for the people." For this, he day and night considers the strategy to exterminate the bandits, advancing through the vast forests and snowy plains; for this, he uses the great thoughts of Mao Zedong to propagate, organize, and arm the people; for this, he fights in countless battles, risking his life, single-handedly blowing up fortresses, infiltrating enemy territory to gather intelligence, entering the lion's den to eliminate tyrants, and daring to take on dangerous missions to eliminate "Seatop Tiger." The people yearn for liberation, and Yang Zhirong fights for the people's liberation.

Yang Zhirong has given his heart to the people, and the people have given their hearts to the people's army, to the savior Communist Party, and to Chairman Mao, the red sun. "Catching dragons with you in the deep sea, fighting tigers with you on the high mountains," "whether it's walking through water or fire, even if we are torn to pieces, we are willing!"

"The people and the army are the foundation of victory." With hearts united between soldiers and civilians, fighting hand in hand, we can defeat all reactionaries and liberate the whole world!

    军民心连心
    工人　张兆雄
    有这样一个场面：
    杨子荣站在猎户老常家里，听着常宝字字血诉说了她一家人悲惨的遭遇，声声泪控诉了土匪的罪状，激起了仇恨满腔。他看着小常宝，眼神是那么深情，又是那么充满信心。他在想什么呢？他从常猎户一家的遭遇，看到了“普天下被压迫的人民都有一本血泪账”，深深意识到自己肩负的重任，决心“要报仇，要伸冤，血债要用血来偿”。为了打翻黑暗的旧社会，解放全中国，他满怀胜利的信心唱道：“消灭座山雕，人民得解放，翻身作主人，深山见太阳。从今后跟着救星共产党，管叫山河换新装。”这发自肺腑的心声，把人民军队和人民群众的心紧紧连在一起，非常生动、非常真切地表达了军民之间的深厚的无产阶级感情。
    猎户老常开天辟地第一次听到杨子荣的这番话，无限激动地说：“老杨，这话说到我心里去了。”是的，杨子荣的话，说到了普天下被压迫人民的心里。
    杨子荣从“找到了共产党走上革命的路一条”时起，就立誓“把剥削根子全拔掉”，“为人民开出那万代幸福泉”。为了这，他日夜考虑剿匪大计，行进在茫茫的林海雪原上；为了这，他用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众；为了这，他身经百战，出生入死，孤胆炸碉堡，深入敌区搞情报，入虎穴除奸霸，闯险要消灭“座山雕”。人民盼望解放，杨子荣为人民解放而战斗。
    杨子荣把心交给了人民群众，人民群众也把心交给了人民军队，交给了救星共产党，交给了红太阳毛主席。“擒龙跟你下大海，打虎随你上高山”，“不管是水里走，火里钻，粉身碎骨也心甘！”
      “兵民是胜利之本”。军民心连心，携手同战斗，就能打败一切反动派，解放全世界！
