The wave of strikes in France is surging and continues to rise, sweeping across all regions and economic sectors of the country. The national economy has fallen into a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis. Western bourgeois public opinion is alarmed, declaring that France is facing the "biggest social, economic, and governmental crisis in thirty years." The various factions within the panicked French bourgeoisie are increasingly at odds with each other. The French revisionists are playing the shameful role of traitors and strike-breakers.

New China News Agency, May 22nd: Paris – The political and economic strike wave by French workers, which has shocked the world, continues to advance with unstoppable momentum. France's railways, maritime, and air transportation have come to a halt, almost completely severing connections with the outside world. The national economy has fallen into a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis. Western bourgeois public opinion is alarmed, declaring that France is facing the "biggest social, economic, and governmental crisis in thirty years."

France's railway system and major seaports are still occupied by striking workers. Despite the French Air Force taking over airports and civil aviation, air transportation remains halted. The strike by postal workers has resulted in a mountain of undelivered mail, with domestic and international telephone and telegraph communications almost entirely disrupted. Even the sea and air connections between the French mainland and its large island in the Mediterranean, Corsica, have been severed. Western news agencies lament that the entire country has become an "isolated island under siege."

By May 21st, the number of workers on strike nationwide had exceeded eight million, and the number continues to grow. On the same day, 14,000 employees of the French national bank, the Bank of France, went on strike, causing the bank's headquarters, branches across the country, and even the currency printing plant to close. Middle and primary school teachers, customs, and tax officials across the country also announced their strikes. On the morning of May 22nd, 15,000 taxi drivers in Paris also went on strike. In the heavy industrial area around the city of Toulouse in southern France, all factory workers have gone on strike. The strike wave has swept across all regions and economic sectors of the country. Some factories and mines that have not yet gone on strike have also stopped production due to disrupted transportation, lack of raw materials, and parts. French industrial production has fallen into a state of paralysis, dealing a heavy blow to the French monopoly bourgeoisie.

Even in the French territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean, airport workers have gone on strike in solidarity with the French workers' struggle. The French airline company has had to cancel flights in this region.

The struggle to occupy factories, enterprises, and workplaces continues to develop. Across France, one can see striking workers hoisting red flags on the facilities they have occupied. On May 21st, several of Paris's largest department stores and several of the most luxurious hotels were also occupied by striking workers. The boss of the American Chrysler Automobile Company was frightened by the French workers' rebellious actions and secretly closed the main factory of his French subsidiary, Simca Company, on May 21st, preventing the 22,000 workers in this factory from entering.

After several days of stock market declines, the Paris stock market has fallen into a state of paralysis. The trading of the French franc has stopped.

Due to the taxi drivers also going on strike, traffic in Paris has become even more congested and chaotic. Garbage piles up in the streets, growing higher and higher. The French authorities had to dispatch military trucks to remove the mountains of garbage near the central market. Food supplies in Paris are insufficient, and the prices of vegetables, meat, and other food items have soared. The French government has had to dispatch military trucks to transport food. The situation in other major French cities is similar to that in Paris.

As the strike wave continues to rise, the various factions within the panicked French bourgeoisie are increasingly at odds with each other. The French Parliament has been in continuous session over the past few days, with various parties loudly debating the "impeachment" of the French government. At the same time, the French government, on the one hand, has mobilized large numbers of military and police forces, vowing to "maintain order" and threatening the revolutionary masses. On the other hand, it announced on May 21st the "pardon" of students who were unjustly sentenced for resisting the police, attempting to deceive the masses and quell the struggle.

To curry favor with the French monopoly bourgeoisie, the leaders of the French revisionist trade unions are doing their utmost to suppress the workers' rebellious actions. They not only oppose the combination of the student movement with the workers' movement and the workers' revolutionary demands but have even publicly ordered the workers occupying the grassroots factories and mines to release the bosses and management personnel who have been detained by them, who have stubbornly refused the workers' reasonable demands and have consistently exploited and oppressed the workers. The leaders of the French revisionist trade unions are also preparing to negotiate with the government and the management behind the backs of the broad masses of striking workers. This once again barefacedly exposes the shameful face of the French revisionist group as traitors and strike-breakers. It is no wonder that the bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe are openly advocating for the French government to "cooperate hand in hand" with the French revisionist group to "regain control" of the masses and solve the "current crisis in France."

    法国罢工怒潮汹涌澎湃继续高涨
    罢工怒潮席卷法国全国各地和所有经济部门，全国经济生活已陷于瘫痪或半瘫痪状态。西方资产阶级舆论惊呼，法国面临三十年来“最大的社会、经济和政府危机”。慌作一团的法国资产阶级内部各派势力之间争吵和矛盾正在不断加剧。法修扮演了可耻的叛徒和工贼的角色
    新华社二十二日讯　巴黎消息：震惊世界的法国工人政治和经济罢工的怒潮，正以不可阻挡之势继续向前发展。法国的铁路、海上和空中交通停顿，同外界的联系几乎断绝，全国经济生活已陷于瘫痪或半瘫痪状态。西方资产阶级舆论惊呼，法国面临三十年来“最大的社会、经济和政府危机”。
    法国的铁路系统和主要的海港，目前继续为罢工的工人占领。尽管法国空军接管了机场和民航事业，空中交通仍然停顿。邮电工人的罢工使得邮件堆积如山，无人递送，国内外的电话、电讯联系几乎全部中断。甚至法国大陆同它在地中海的大岛——科西嘉岛的海空联系，也已断绝。西方通讯社哀叹，整个法国已变成一个“被围困的孤岛”。
    二十一日，法国全国参加罢工的工人已超过八百万，罢工的人数仍在与时俱增。法国国家银行——法兰西银行的一万四千名职工二十一日参加罢工，使得这家银行的总行和在全国各地的分行以至钞票印刷厂，通通关门。法国全国的中学和小学教师以及海关和税务人员，同日也宣布罢教、罢工。巴黎的一万五千名出租汽车司机二十二日凌晨也宣告罢工。在法国南部图卢兹市周围的重工业区，全部工厂的工人都已罢工。罢工的浪潮席卷法国全国各地和所有经济部门。还没有罢工的一些厂矿企业，也由于交通断绝，缺乏原料和零件等原因而停工。法国的工业生产已陷入瘫痪状态，法国垄断资产阶级受到了沉重的打击。
    远在拉丁美洲加勒比海地区的法国属地瓜德罗普岛和马提尼克岛，机场职工也举行罢工，声援法国工人的斗争。法国航空公司为此不得不取消在这个地区的飞行。
    占领厂矿、企业和工作场所的斗争仍在继续发展。在法国各地，到处可以看到罢工工人在他们占领的厂房设施上升起鲜艳的红旗。巴黎几个最大的百货商店和几家最豪华的大旅馆，二十一日也被罢工的工人占领。美国克莱斯勒汽车公司的老板被法国工人的造反行动吓破了胆，二十一日偷偷地把他在法国的子公司——西姆卡公司的主要工厂关闭，不让在这个工厂工作的二万二千工人进厂。
    在法国股票连日下跌以后，巴黎股票市场二十一日已陷入瘫痪状态。法国法郎的交易停顿。
    由于出租汽车司机也宣告罢工，巴黎市内的交通更加拥挤和混乱。垃圾满街，越积越多。法国当局不得不派军车来搬运中央市场附近堆积如山的垃圾。巴黎的食品供应不足，蔬菜、肉类和其他食品的价格猛涨。法国政府被迫出动军车装运食物。其他法国大城市的情况同巴黎也差不多。
    在罢工怒潮继续高涨的形势下，慌作一团的法国资产阶级内部各派势力之间争吵和矛盾正在不断加剧。法国议会这几天接连开会，就一些政党对法国政府的“弹劾案”大吵大嚷。与此同时，法国政府一方面调集大批军警，叫嚷决心“维持秩序”，威胁革命群众，另一方面在二十一日又宣布“赦免”因反击警察而被无理判刑的学生，妄图以此来欺骗群众，平息斗争。
    为了讨好法国垄断资产阶级，法修的工会头目极力压制工人的造反行动。他们不仅反对学生运动同工人运动相结合，反对工人的革命要求，甚至公然下令，逼迫占领基层厂矿的工人，释放那些已被他们扣留的、顽固拒绝工人合理要求、一贯剥削和欺压工人的老板和资方人员。法修的工会头目还背着广大的罢工工人群众，准备同政府和资方谈判。这又一次赤裸裸地暴露了法国修正主义集团叛徒和工贼的可耻面目。这就无怪乎西欧的资产阶级报纸也公开鼓吹，要法国政府同法国修正主义集团“携手合作”，“重新控制”群众，以解决“法国当前的危机”。
