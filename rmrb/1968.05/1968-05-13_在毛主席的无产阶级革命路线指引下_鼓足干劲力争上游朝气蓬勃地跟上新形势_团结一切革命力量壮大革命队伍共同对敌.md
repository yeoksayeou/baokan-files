The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel enthusiastically cheer the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, continue to strengthen the unity between the military and the people, intensify class struggle, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. They will expose and thoroughly criticize the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents, and fight them to the end. They will root out the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, Kuomintang spies, and hidden or infiltrated traitors and counter-revolutionaries, and achieve victory in both revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 12th, the entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel enthusiastically cheer the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, an important industrial base in our country, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel resolutely declare that in the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, focus on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, unite all revolutionary forces, form a mighty revolutionary army, and launch a more fierce attack on the class enemy. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with the spirit of "seizing the day," they will strive to be in the forefront, pay attention to studying new problems that arise in the movement, discover and support new revolutionary things, keep up with the developing new situation, advance victoriously, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The good news spread, and the country was in a state of excitement. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life! A long life! They repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Revolutionary committees and revolutionary committee preparatory groups in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jilin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions sent telegrams of congratulations to the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Many places held celebration activities. The broad masses of military and civilian personnel excitedly pointed out that under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Revolutionary Committee was established in Liaoning Province, which is on the front line of national defense. This further strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is a heavy blow to all class enemies at home and abroad and a great encouragement to the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel nationwide who are striving for comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China led by the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In the moment of celebrating victory, the military and civilian personnel in various places reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching, determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasp the general direction of the revolutionary struggle, carry forward the thorough and decisive revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, focus on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal wind, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, expose and thoroughly criticize the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents, fight them to the end, root out the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The revolutionary masses and cadres of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory emphasized that against the handful of class enemies, we must confront them head-on, strike them down, thoroughly expose all their tricks, isolate them to the greatest extent, and strike them hard, without showing any mercy.

Chairman Mao recently taught us again: "We must believe that more than ninety percent of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be reformed." The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of the People's Liberation Army in various places seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to continue to unite and educate the vast majority of cadres and masses, strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and those between the enemy and us, constantly strengthen the revolutionary ranks, unite and win over allies, and unite all revolutionary forces under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into a mighty revolutionary army to fight the enemy together. The military and civilian personnel in various places declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "be ruthless to the enemy, to suppress it, to annihilate it; to be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, with subordinates." The revolutionary cadres in Tianjin, Harbin, Nanjing, Guiyang, and Yinchuan declared that they would strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, unite the vast majority of masses and cadres, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and consolidate the newly born revolutionary committees.

Many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have already established revolutionary committees, in celebrating the simultaneous birth of the Liaoning Provincial and Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committees, resolutely declared that under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, they would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance victoriously, and achieve new victories. The revolutionary workers of the Hunan New China Printing Factory said that they would definitely, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, carry forward the thorough and decisive revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, further deepen the revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. The proletarian revolutionary cadres and masses in Sichuan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Fujian, and Tibet, upon hearing the good news of the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee, were greatly inspired and expressed their determination to catch up swiftly, seize the good situation, ride the east wind, closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a more fierce attack on the class enemy, and strive for the early establishment of the revolutionary committees in their provinces and autonomous regions.

While celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, an important industrial base in our country, the military and civilian personnel in various places are determined to better implement the great policy of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." They will make greater contributions on the fronts of national defense, industry, agriculture, transportation, and other fields, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary workers on the textile industry front in Shijiazhuang, who have made outstanding achievements in the struggle to grasp revolution and promote production, declared that they would, on the basis of over-fulfilling the state plan every month this year, further develop the good situation of revolution and production. The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Special Steel Tube Factory declared that they would turn their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into actual actions of grasping revolution and promoting production, and launch a new high tide of revolution and production throughout the factory. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Shandong Province declared that "grasping revolution and promoting production" is a component part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and an important aspect of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They resolutely implement it, grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, and strive for a greater harvest in agriculture this year.

The broad masses of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in all parts of the country immediately held celebration meetings, sent warm telegrams and letters of congratulations to the military and civilian personnel of Liaoning, or sent teams to deliver the good news to mountain villages and fishing villages upon hearing the good news of the simultaneous glorious birth of the Liaoning Provincial and Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committees. The heroic fighters who, under the command of the great commander Chairman Mao and Vice Commander Lin, participated in the three campaigns south of the Yangtze River, the four defenses of Lianjiang, and the Liaoshen Campaign, the heroic volunteers who, together with the Korean people, exposed the paper tiger of American imperialism in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the broad masses of soldiers stationed on the front lines of national defense and coastal defense expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and unite more closely with the proletarian revolutionary cadres and masses nationwide, launch a more fierce attack on the class enemy without stopping, resolutely suppress those class enemies who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotage socialist construction, and disrupt social order, resolutely root out the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, Kuomintang spies, and hidden or infiltrated counter-revolutionaries, defend socialist motherland, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend the newly born revolutionary committees, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad masses of soldiers on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" in various parts of the country, while celebrating the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee, repeatedly studied the editorial "The Northeast Land is Red and Fragrant" in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. They resolutely declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," do a better job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, and make new and greater contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
