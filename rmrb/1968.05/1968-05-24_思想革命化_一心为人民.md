The Revolutionary Committee of Longchang People's Commune in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, immediately focused on the fundamental task of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works after its establishment. They organized a "political field training" Mao Zedong Thought study class. All members of the Revolutionary Committee brought their problems to three different locations, linked them with reality, and actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought. Through this study, they further established the viewpoints of holding power for the proletariat, class struggle, and wholeheartedly serving the people.

At the Martyrs' Graves, Pledging Loyalty

On the second day after the establishment of the commune's Revolutionary Committee in late February, eleven committee members and a soldier from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team went to the hillside of Guojia Brigade. This is where 128 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Anshan are buried. They sat around the martyrs' graves and began the first lesson of their study class. First, they invited an old poor peasant who had buried the martyrs to share the stories of the martyrs' brave battles and heroic sacrifices. With tears of sorrow, they studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power." "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their blood-stained path!"

Everyone thought of the countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the seizure of revolutionary power, of the tragic scenes of the broad laboring masses in the old society who were oppressed because they had no power, and of the happy lives of the laboring masses after Mao Zedong led them to seize and hold power. They also thought of the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev who attempted to restore capitalism. They deeply felt that the new and old societies are two different worlds, and ultimately, it is about power; they truly understood the pain of having no power, the importance of holding power, and the danger of losing power.

The commune's Revolutionary Committee chairman (formerly the commune's Party Committee secretary) Tian Qingyan, originally did not feel at ease working in the mountainous area and did not want to be the top leader. At the martyrs' graves, he thought of his miserable experiences in the old society, of the martyrs who lie in eternal rest, and of the Party's cultivation of him. He shed hot tears. He said, "I should not forget the bitterness of the old society, nor should I forget the power of the proletariat. Forgetting the bitterness of the class, forgetting to hold power for the proletariat, is forgetting one's roots, is being disloyal to Chairman Mao." He pledged to the martyrs: "I will use my blood and life to hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants and work in the mountainous area for life."

Never Forget Class Struggle

Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," the students went to the eighth production brigade of Jiaojia Gully, where class struggle is relatively complex, to learn from old poor peasants about class struggle.

A small group of class enemies in this brigade colluded with each other, engaged in capitalist restoration activities, oppressed the poor and lower-middle peasants, and did many bad things. This brigade is only three miles away from the commune, but in the past, the commune cadres turned a blind eye to it. Why? The students, with this question in mind, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on the existence of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and the danger of capitalist restoration. They received a very practical education on class struggle. The deputy chairman of the commune's Revolutionary Committee (formerly the deputy commune director) Ma Chengshu, who had seen some phenomena of class struggle here in the past, felt that "a few muddy eels cannot cause big waves." This time, after listening to the old poor peasants' class struggle lessons, he said painfully, "Now I see clearly that if we do not seize the enemy's power, the enemy will seize ours. In the past, I did not grasp class struggle, and I almost became a confused person who didn't know how his head was cut off."

Learning from Frad Yu Lu Style Cadres

After the first two lessons, everyone's souls were deeply touched, and their class consciousness was greatly enhanced. To learn from examples and find gaps, they went to Qijia Brigade. This brigade has a revolutionary leadership team.

The brigade's poor peasants' association chairman, Luan Wenkai, has been a cadre in this brigade since the land reform. For twenty years, he has wholeheartedly served the poor and lower-middle peasants. He suffers from severe gastric ulcers but continues to work while carrying the illness and laboring with the commune members. The masses call him "our brigade's Frad Yu Lu." The main leader of the brigade, Qiu Mianrong, is over fifty years old. He often says, "I want to be like Norman Bethune, Zhang Side, and the old fool, and do one day of revolution for one day of life." Another leader of the brigade, Zhang Nanhai, is a demobilized soldier who goes wherever there is difficulty. In this leadership team, there are also a few young people who are full of vigor and vitality. It is this leadership team that, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasps the revolution, promotes production, and achieves one victory after another.

The students, taking the leadership team of Qijia Brigade as an example, compared and checked their revolutionary will, and found many gaps. They said, "There are thousands of differences, but the difference is that our class feelings for Chairman Mao are not as deep as those of the comrades in Qijia Brigade, our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works are not as good as those of the comrades in Qijia Brigade, and our thoughts of wholeheartedly serving the people are not as firm as those of the comrades in Qijia Brigade." Everyone expressed that they would be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, actively study and apply the "Three Old Articles," and forever be the people's servants.

Before the study class ended, a summary was made. The students said, "This study class has the most lively teaching materials, the most teachers, the deepest education, and the greatest harvest." Many old poor peasants also praised, "The Revolutionary Committee's study class this time is well-organized, carrying on the style of the old Eighth Route Army, truly a new team, new thoughts, and new style. If it continues like this, we will be at ease!"

    思想革命化　一心为人民
    辽宁省辽阳县隆昌人民公社革命委员会一成立，首先就抓活学活用毛主席著作这个根本，举办了一期“政治野营式”的毛泽东思想学习班。革委会全体委员带着问题，到三个不同的地点，联系实际，活学活用毛泽东思想。通过学习，他们进一步树立了为无产阶级掌好权用好权的观点、阶级斗争观点和全心全意为人民服务的观点。
    烈士墓前表忠心
    二月下旬，公社革命委员会成立后的第二天，十一名委员和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的一位同志，来到郭家大队的山坡上。这里是烈士墓地，安葬着为解放鞍山而壮烈牺牲的一百二十八名烈士。他们围坐在烈士墓前，开始上学习班的第一课。首先请一位曾经安葬烈士的老贫农介绍了烈士们当年英勇战斗、壮烈牺牲的事迹。大家含着悲痛的泪水，学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”他们联系自己的思想，对夺取政权，巩固政权问题进行了讨论。
    大家联想到无数革命先烈为夺取革命政权献身的英勇事迹，联想到旧社会广大劳动群众因为无权，祖祖辈辈当牛做马的悲惨情景，联想到毛主席领导广大劳动群众夺权掌权后的幸福生活，以及中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们深深地感到：新旧社会两个天，归根结底在政权；真正懂得了无权的痛苦，掌权的重要，失权的危险。
    公社革委会主任（原公社党委书记）田庆岩，原来不那么安心在山区工作，也不想当第一把手。在烈士墓前，他想起自己解放前的悲惨遭遇，想起长眠地下的烈士，想起党对自己的培养，流下了热泪。他说：“我不该忘记旧社会的苦，不该忘记无产阶级的权。忘了阶级苦，忘了为无产阶级掌权，就是忘了本，就是对毛主席不忠。”他向烈士宣誓：要用鲜血和生命为贫下中农掌好权，安心在山区工作一辈子。
    念念不忘阶级斗争
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，学员们来到了阶级斗争比较复杂的焦家沟第八生产队，请老贫农上阶级斗争课。
    这个队有一小撮阶级敌人互相勾结，大搞资本主义复辟活动，欺压贫下中农，做了许多坏事。这个队离公社不过三里地，可是过去公社干部却视而不见。原因在哪里？学员们带着这个问题，重温了毛主席关于在社会主义社会中“还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性”的教导，受到了一次最实际的阶级斗争教育。公社革委会副主任（原公社副社长）马成书，过去在这里看到过一些阶级斗争的现象，可是他觉得“几条泥鳅翻不起大浪”。这次听老贫农讲了阶级斗争课，他十分痛心地说：“现在我看清楚了，我们不专敌人的政，敌人就要专我们的政。我过去不抓阶级斗争，几乎变成了那种脑袋掉了还不知道怎么掉的糊涂人。”
    向焦裕禄式的干部学习
    经过前两课的教育，大家狠触了灵魂，阶级觉悟有很大提高。为了学榜样，找差距，他们又来到了祁家大队。因为这个大队有一个革命化的领导班子。
    大队贫协主任栾文科，从土改时起就在这个队当干部，二十年来，全心全意为贫下中农服务。他患有严重的胃溃疡，长期带病坚持工作，和社员一起劳动。群众称他是“我们队里的焦裕禄”。大队主要负责人丘绵荣，五十多岁了，他经常说：“我要象白求恩、张思德、老愚公一样，活一天就干一天革命。”大队另一个负责人张南海，是个复员军人，哪里有困难就到哪里去。在这个领导班子里，还有几个青年人，更是生龙活虎，朝气蓬勃。就是由这样一些同志组成的大队领导班子，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取了一个又一个的胜利。
    学员们以祁家大队领导班子为榜样，对比检查自己的革命意志，大找差距。他们说：“千差万差，差在我们对毛主席的阶级感情不如祁家大队的同志们深，活学活用毛主席著作不如祁家大队的同志们好，全心全意为人民服务的思想不如祁家大队的同志们牢。”大家纷纷表示：要无限忠于毛主席，活学活用“老三篇”，永远做人民的勤务员。
    学习班结束前，进行了总结。学员们说：“这一期学习班，教材最活，教员最多，受教育最深，收获最大。”许多老贫农也赞扬说：“革委会这次学习班办得好，发扬了老八路的作风，真是新班子、新思想、新作风。照这样下去，咱们就放心了！”
