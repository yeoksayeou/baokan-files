Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the revolutionary and production situation in Sichuan's rural areas is excellent and getting better every day. On the basis of the all-around bumper harvest of agriculture last year, Sichuan's summer grain crops have again reported a bumper harvest this year, with wheat, peas, and beans all showing increased yields.

Currently, from the Chengdu Plain to the banks of the Yangtze River in eastern Sichuan, from the banks of the Jinsha River in southern Sichuan to the foothills of the Daba Mountains in northern Sichuan, everywhere is bustling with activity, and reports of revolutionary and production victories are constantly coming in. At present, many prefectures, cities, and counties in the province have established revolutionary committees, and revolutionary committees in rural grassroots units are emerging like bamboo shoots after a rain. Cadres at all levels are actively rushing to the front lines of summer harvesting and planting, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and promoting both revolution and production to do new things for the people. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields and courtyards during the busy farming season, and following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp grain production" and "grasp cotton production," launching a summer harvesting and planting campaign. This year's summer harvesting and planting in Sichuan Province not only progressed quickly but also maintained high quality.

After the baptism of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have undergone a complete change in their spiritual outlook. They emphasize proletarian politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide revolution and production. The great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has been further expanded and deepened. In the past few months, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, various regions and units in the province have held more than 400,000 study classes of various types, with over 20 million people participating in the study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are conducting a thorough criticism and repudiation of the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan, such as the "four freedoms," "three autonomies and one contract," and the theory of the "extinction of class struggle." In many communes and production teams in Leshan, Yibin, Wenjiang, Wanzhou, and Fuling prefectures, they have combined the class struggle in their own communes and teams, severely criticized the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminated their poisonous influence, and greatly raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of commune members.

The revolutionary criticism has powerfully promoted the mass movement of learning from Dazhai. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan had strongly obstructed and sabotaged the movement of the broad masses of commune members learning from Dazhai. They promoted material incentives, using the issuance of large amounts of loans and fertilizers to "cultivate" so-called "models," thereby corrupting the commune members' spirit of self-reliance. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have seen through the wolfish ambitions of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan to restore capitalism, further recognizing the great significance of Chairman Mao's proposal to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely take the path of Dazhai.

Last winter and this spring, more than ten million laborers in the Dujiangyan irrigation area in western Sichuan carried out repairs on the irrigation facilities. The broad masses of commune members held Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the construction sites, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance of the Dazhai people, overcoming various difficulties. They used lime and stones to replace cement, saving the country a large amount of cement. The repair work of the entire irrigation area was completed ahead of schedule. The prefectures of Mianyang, Yibin, Neijiang, Leshan, Wanzhou, and Fuling, after criticizing the revisionist water conservancy policies of the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Sichuan, launched a mass movement of self-reliance and small-scale water conservancy projects. Various places built a large number of small reservoirs and canals, making the spring irrigation water situation better than in previous years. During the spring plowing, due to a shortage of fertilizers, many production teams' commune members, young and old, men and women, all went out to gather and make fertilizers; at the same time, they actively planted more green manure crops and developed pig farming to provide a large amount of fertilizers for production. The Wenjiang Prefecture, due to the application of a large amount of farmyard manure, increased the wheat yield this year and reduced the cost significantly.

Recently, the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee and the Chengdu Military Region held a provincial telephone conference, requiring all places to, in the process of rushing to harvest and plant, take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, take class struggle as the key link, and let revolution guide production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places have expressed that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for greater victories in revolution and production.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下
    四川农村革命和生产形势大好
    许多专区、市、县成立革委会，夏收粮食作物普遍增产
    据新华社成都二十七日电　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，四川省农村革命和生产形势大好，越来越好。在去年农业全面大丰收的基础上，四川今年夏收粮食作物又喜报丰收，小麦、豌豆、蚕豆等普遍增产。
    目前，从川西平原到川东长江两岸，从川南金沙江边到川北大巴山麓，到处热气腾腾，不断传来革命和生产的胜利喜讯。现在，全省有许多专区、市、县成立了革命委员会，农村基层单位的革命委员会更是象雨后春笋般地涌现出来。各级革命干部积极奔赴夏收夏种第一线，同社员群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起抓革命促生产，为人民立新功。广大贫下中农社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在农事大忙中大办田间、院坝毛泽东思想学习班，并且遵循毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧”的教导，掀起了夏收夏种高潮。今年四川省的夏收夏种不仅进度快，而且质量高。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，广大贫下中农和革命干部精神面貌焕然一新。他们突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅革命和生产。活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动更加广泛深入地开展起来。最近几个月内，在人民解放军的帮助下，全省各地区、各单位已经举办了四十多万期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有两千多万人参加了学习。广大贫下中农以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线。乐山、宜宾、温江、万县、涪陵等专区许多社队，结合本社本队的阶级斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货，清除其流毒，大大提高了广大社员的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    革命的大批判，有力地推动了群众性的学大寨运动。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川的代理人极力阻挠和破坏广大社员学大寨的运动。他们大搞物质刺激，用发放大量贷款和化肥的手段去“培养”所谓“典型”，借此腐蚀社员自力更生的革命精神。通过革命的大批判，广大贫下中农更加看透了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川的代理人复辟资本主义的狼子野心，进一步认识到毛主席提出的“农业学大寨”的伟大意义。他们决心按照毛主席的教导，坚决走大寨的道路。
    去冬今春，川西平原都江堰灌区出动了十多万个劳动力，对灌区工程进行了整修。广大社员在工地上大办毛泽东思想学习班，发扬大寨人自力更生的无产阶级革命精神，克服了各种困难。他们用石灰和石头代替水泥，为国家节约了大量水泥。全灌区的整修工程，全部提前完成。绵阳、宜宾、内江、乐山、万县、涪陵等专区，在批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在四川的代理人所推行的修正主义水利方针后，掀起了自力更生、以小型为主的群众性兴建水利工程的活动。各地修建了大量小型塘堰和水渠，使今年春耕用水情况比历年都好。春耕时，肥料不足，许多社队的社员，男女老少一齐出动，积肥造肥；同时积极增种绿肥作物，发展养猪事业，为生产提供了大量肥料。温江专区由于增施了大量农家肥料，今年小麦产量提高，成本降低很多。
    最近，四川省革筹小组和成都军区召开全省电话会议，要求各地在进行抢收抢种工作中，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，以阶级斗争为纲，以革命统帅生产。各地广大贫下中农和革命干部表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
