Workers and students in Argentina are fighting against the reactionary authorities.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on May 15, recent events in Buenos Aires show that Argentine workers have been continuously fighting against the pro-American dictatorship's reactionary economic policies, which are designed to meet the needs of U.S. monopoly capital. These policies have resulted in massive unemployment and worsening living conditions for the working people. At the same time, Argentine students have been frequently staging strikes and demonstrations to protest against the government's reactionary educational policies, which are being implemented under U.S. instructions.

	On April 29, workers at the Kaiser automobile company in the capital, which is jointly operated with U.S. capital, went on strike to protest against the management's reduction of production and layoffs. On April 26, 6,000 workers at the Renault-IKA automobile manufacturing plant in Cordoba announced a strike to protest against the closure of some workshops. Earlier, more than 1,000 workers at the "Aurora" printing factory in the capital's industrial zone occupied the factory because the management refused to grant a 40% wage increase. They bravely resisted police suppression. In the San Lorenzo area of Santa Fe Province, more than 2,000 workers held a rally and demonstration to protest against the dismissal of 920 workers by a local ceramic factory. The demonstrators shouted slogans against the Onganía dictatorship.

	Sugar workers in Tucumán Province have been persistently opposing the government's economic "reorganization" plan, which is carried out under the direction of U.S. capital and harms the interests of the working people. On April 28, the laboring people of Tucumán City held a mass rally and demonstration to protest against the dismissal of dozens of workers by a sugar factory.

	According to statistics published in the Argentine bi-weekly magazine "Liberación," the Argentine currency depreciated by 40% last year, the number of unemployed increased by 31%, and living expenses rose by 30%. It is reported that this year, living expenses in Argentina are expected to rise by another 30%.

	At the same time, Argentine students have also been engaged in fierce struggles against the reactionary authorities. In recent periods, the Argentine reactionary authorities have issued several decrees and policies to further abolish university autonomy, deprive students of their right to participate in political activities, and exclude poor students from entering universities. To protest against these reactionary decrees, students at the University of La Plata in the provincial capital of Buenos Aires Province held a general strike and demonstration on April 30. They shouted slogans against the Onganía pro-American dictatorship during the demonstration.

    反对反动经济政策　反对反动教育政策　反对亲美独裁政权
    阿根廷工人学生同反动当局展开斗争
    据新华社十五日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：最近以来，阿根廷工人不断展开斗争，反对亲美独裁政权为适应美国垄断资本的需要而推行的反动经济政策，这种政策造成了劳动人民大批失业和生活的日益贫困化。同时，阿根廷学生也不断举行罢课和示威，抗议政府在美国指使下实行的反动教育政策。
    四月二十九日，有美资合伙经营的首都凯塞汽车公司的工人举行罢工，抗议资方缩减生产和裁减工人。二十六日，科尔多瓦的雷纳特—伊卡汽车制造厂的六千名工人宣布罢工，抗议厂方关闭一些车间。在这以前，首都工业区
  “黎明”绘画厂的一千多名工人，由于资方拒绝工人增加工资百分之四十的要求而占领了工厂，并且英勇地抗击警察的镇压。在圣菲省的圣洛伦索地区两千多名工人举行集会和示威游行，抗议当地的陶瓷厂解雇九百二十名工人。示威群众高呼反对翁加尼亚独裁政府的口号。
    图库曼省糖业工人也坚持不懈地反对政府在美国资本指使下实行损害劳动人民利益的经济“改组”计划。四月二十八日，图库曼市劳动人民举行了群众大会和示威游行，抗议一家糖厂解雇几十名工人。
    据阿根廷《解放》半月刊发表的统计数字，去年一年，阿根廷货币贬值百分之四十，失业人数增加百分之三十一，生活费用上涨百分之三十。据报道，今年阿根廷的生活费用估计将进一步上涨百分之三十。
    同时，阿根廷学生同反动当局也展开了激烈斗争。最近一个时期，阿根廷反动当局公布了一些法令和政策，规定进一步废除大学自治，剥夺学生参加政治活动的权利，排斥贫苦学生入学。为了抗议这些反动法令，布宜诺斯艾利斯省省会拉普拉塔市大学生在四月三十日举行总罢课和示威游行，他们在示威中高呼反对翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权的口号。
