The Paris student movement is rapidly rising, and strikes by French workers are sweeping the nation. French students and workers have bravely risen up to rebel against the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The revolutionary storm sweeping through France is shaking the heart of the capitalist world. We warmly applaud the heroic struggle of French workers and students and resolutely support their revolutionary actions!

Revolutionary storms always reveal the true colors of revolutionaries and expose the ugly faces of those who wear the cloak of revolution but are traitors and scabs. The French revisionist group led by Roger and their masters, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, have been slandering, defaming, deceiving, and sabotaging the revolutionary mass movement. They have once again committed a shameful crime against the French people.

The Roger group claims that the heroic struggle of workers and students is a "reckless adventure" that will "bring the greatest harm to the revolutionary movement." They frantically shout that they do not "recognize" or "approve" of workers occupying factories. Their so-called "recklessness" is merely that the revolutionary mass movement is surging forward rapidly, not following their pre-arranged "gentle revolutionary development program" agreed upon with the ruling class.

Their claim that the revolutionary movement will "bring the greatest harm" is actually a severe blow to the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The panic and disarray of the French ruling class fully show that the revolutionary storm sweeping across France is not "terrible" but is very good! Very good!

The revolutionary actions of French workers and students do not need the "recognition" and "approval" of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and their lackeys. The French working class and people have the right to take all revolutionary actions. The proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world support the revolutionary actions of French workers and students.

The Roger group, on the one hand, uses unions controlled by French revisionists to sabotage workers' struggles, and on the other hand, tries to divide the workers' movement and the student movement to achieve their evil goal of disintegrating the revolutionary mass movement. They slander students for "interfering" in workers' struggles, block students from going to factories, and prevent workers from participating in student demonstrations. They even claim that "workers do not intend to rely on the movement to achieve their demands for rights." This is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary argument.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All intellectual youth and student youth in the country must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and become one with them, to form a powerful army." French students have actively united with workers, and they have done well and correctly! Modern revisionists who sabotage this unity are serving the monopolistic bourgeoisie. Even the French ruling class admits that the French revisionists' refusal to support the progressive student movement "is a factor that may to some extent reduce social tension in France." This shows how much the actions of the French revisionists align with the wishes of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie!

The treacherous actions of the French revisionists are inseparable from the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. When the Paris student movement just began, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique had already set the tone. The Soviet "Pravda" newspaper on May 8th openly viciously attacked the just struggle of Paris students as "riots" and "rebellious actions," openly cheering for the French ruling class's suppression of students, and praising "the ringleaders of the riots being handed over to the court for trial." Look, the face of the traitor to the proletariat and the accomplice of imperialism is so vivid!

The revolutionary storm has torn off the deceitful mask of modern revisionism, and people clearly see how despicable and hateful this gang of traitors and scabs is! They play a destructive role in the people's revolutionary struggle that the monopolistic bourgeoisie cannot play.

The great revolutionary teacher Lenin pointed out long ago: "The struggle against imperialism, if not closely linked with the struggle against opportunism, is a deceitful phrase." The French people, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, are throwing this gang of traitors and scabs into the garbage heap of history. Many factory workers have announced their withdrawal from unions controlled by French revisionists, established their own organizations, and joined the battle. In the stormy revolutionary struggle, the French working class and the broad masses of people are increasingly recognizing that modern revisionism is also their vicious enemy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao points out: "Opportunists who try to block the tide, although almost everywhere, cannot stop the tide. Socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, casting all stumbling blocks behind it." Let all traitors and scabs go to hell! The revolution of the French people will surely win! The future of France belongs to the daring French people who fight!

    让一切叛徒工贼统统见鬼去吧

    巴黎学生运动迅猛兴起，法国工人罢工席卷全国。法国的学生和工人为反抗垄断资产阶级的反动统治英勇地起来造反了。法国革命群众运动的雷雨风暴，震撼着资本主义世界的心脏。我们最热烈地欢呼法国工人、学生的英勇斗争，最坚决地支持法国工人、学生的革命行动！
    革命的暴风骤雨，总是使革命者展现雄姿，而使那些披着革命外衣的叛徒、工贼暴露丑恶的原形。法修罗歇集团及其主子苏修叛徒集团，对革命的群众运动大肆进行诬蔑、诽谤、欺骗和破坏。他们对法国人民又一次犯下了可耻的罪行。
    罗歇集团胡说什么工人、学生的英勇斗争是“冒险主义行动”，会“给革命运动带来最大的损害”。他们气急败坏地叫嚷“不承认”、“不批准”工人占领工厂的行动。他们所说的“冒险”，无非是革命群众运动气势迅猛，没有按照他们事先与统治阶级议定的“温文尔雅的革命发展章程”进行。
    他们所说的“给革命运动带来最大的损害”，其实正是猛烈的革命运动给予垄断资产阶级以沉重的打击。法国统治阶级惊慌万状、狼狈不堪的样子，充分表明目前澎湃于法国全境的革命怒潮完全不是“糟得很”，而是好得很！好得很！
    法国工人和学生的革命行动，完全不需要得到垄断资产阶级及其奴仆的“承认”和“批准”。法国的工人阶级，法国的人民有权采取一切革命的行动。全世界的无产阶级和革命人民支持法国工人和学生的革命行动。
    罗歇集团一方面通过法修控制的工会破坏工人斗争，一方面力图分化工人运动和学生运动的结合，以达到瓦解革命群众运动的罪恶目的。他们诬蔑学生“干预”了工人斗争，他们阻挡学生到工厂里去，不准许工人参加学生的游行。他们竟胡说什么“工人们并不打算依靠运动来达到他们的权利要求”。这是彻头彻尾的反革命的论调。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。”法国学生主动结合工人，他们做得好，做得对！现代修正主义者破坏这种结合，就是在为垄断资产阶级效劳。连法国统治阶级自己都招认，法修拒绝支持进步的学生运动，“是一个可能在某种程度上减少法国社会的紧张状态的因素”。由此可见，法修的所作所为是多么投合法国垄断资产阶级的心意啊！
    法修这套叛卖革命的行径，是和苏修叛徒集团分不开的。在巴黎学生运动刚刚发动的时候，苏修叛徒集团就已经定下了调子。苏修《真理报》五月八日公然恶毒攻击巴黎学生的正义斗争是“骚乱”，是“叛乱行动”，公开为法国统治集团镇压学生的行径叫好，赞赏“骚乱的祸首被提交法庭受审”。请看，苏修这副无产阶级叛徒、帝国主义帮凶的嘴脸，又是何等地活灵活现啊！
    革命的暴风揭下了现代修正主义骗人的面纱，人们清楚地看到这伙叛徒和工贼，是多么可恶可恨！他们对于人民的革命斗争起着垄断资产阶级所不能起的破坏作用。
    伟大的革命导师列宁早就指出：“反对帝国主义的斗争，如果不同反对机会主义的斗争密切联系起来，就是一句骗人的空话。”具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国人民正在把这伙叛徒、工贼抛进历史的垃圾堆。许多工厂的工人宣布脱离法修控制的工会，自立组织，投入战斗。在革命斗争的疾风暴雨中，法国工人阶级和广大人民日益认清，现代修正主义同样是他们的凶恶的敌人。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”让一切叛徒、工贼统统见鬼去吧！法国人民的革命必胜！法国的未来属于敢于斗争的法国人民！
