The Hohhot Railway Bureau and its 77 subordinate units have all established revolutionary committees. During the two-year-long Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of the Hohhot Railway Bureau have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully played the role of the vanguard of the working class, and have always stood at the forefront of the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the locality, achieving one victory after another. They have thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, achieving the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions throughout the line, and from the railway bureau to various grassroots units, have successively achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Currently, the broad revolutionary masses are following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and launching a more fierce attack on the class enemies. From workers to family members, from offices to workshops, the entire line has set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism everywhere. They are determined to thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, to dig out all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements, and to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of the Hohhot Railway Bureau are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," making the revolutionary and production situation throughout the bureau very good, and gradually improving transportation efficiency. In April of this year, the entire bureau overfulfilled the transportation task, further improving the quality of transportation work, and the order of passenger and freight train operations is normal.
