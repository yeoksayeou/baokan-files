Japanese revolutionary workers and peasants are actively participating in study classes on Chairman Mao's works and are striving to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

	BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the East Asia News Agency, revolutionary workers and peasants in Japan are studying Chairman Mao's works in order to better fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

	In Fukuoka Prefecture's Omuta City, there is a study class on Chairman Mao's works. Participants include miners from the Mitsui Coal Mine, truck drivers, and teachers from a nearby elementary school, totaling over 30 people. Since last autumn, they have formed this study class and have been holding regular study and discussion meetings. Whenever a discussion meeting is held, the students all hold red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," wear shining gold Mao badges, sing "The East Is Red," and recite quotations from Chairman Mao. Sometimes, the discussions go on until late at night.

	At a recent discussion meeting, a Mitsui Coal Mine worker named Fujisawa, who participated in the struggle against the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier entering Sasebo, said: To make a revolution, one must arm oneself with great Mao Zedong Thought. If one does not do this, one will not become a revolutionary fighter who is fearless of sacrifice and struggles hard for the people's interests. He said that in the high tide of the anti-American patriotic struggle, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Maruyama tried to extinguish the people's fighting spirit, and many facts have proven that they are shameful traitors.

	Another Mitsui Coal Mine worker pointed out that currently, Japanese monopolistic capitalists have closely colluded with American imperialism and are ruthlessly exploiting workers. Japanese revolutionary people can only make a revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow the enemies on their heads.

	A union member said, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, to become a true revolutionary, one must thoroughly reform one's worldview. Only by not fearing difficulties, not fearing sacrifices, and struggling hard, standing at the forefront of the people's struggle, can one persist in the revolution to the end.

	Truck driver Tanaka said: Mao Zedong Thought has shown the Japanese people the path to revolution. This is Chairman Mao's greatest support and encouragement to the Japanese people. We can only advance on the path guided by Mao Zedong Thought to achieve the victory of the Japanese revolution.

	In recent years, farmers in Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka have, together with other revolutionary masses, resolutely opposed the Sato government's construction of the "New International Airport" to serve American imperialism's expansion of aggressive war. In recent struggles, they have posted large banners in Sanrizuka, such as:

	"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"
	"Long live the unity of workers, peasants, and students!"
	"Victory will surely belong to the revolutionary people who persist in struggle!"

	A Sanrizuka farmer said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Persistence is victory.' As long as we do not fear sacrifice, do not fear difficulties, and resolutely struggle together with workers and students, we will surely achieve the final victory."

	An old man wearing a shining gold Mao badge said that wearing the Mao badge gives me courage in fighting against the enemy.

	A young farmer said, Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat the enemy. We, together with the Chinese people and the people of the world, will surely carry on our struggle to the end, until we completely overthrow American imperialism and its running dogs.

	Recently, in a struggle, the chairman of the Sanrizuka Farmers' Alliance to Oppose the Construction of the Airport, Mr. Tomura, deeply felt that we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works and apply Mao Zedong Thought to our practical struggles.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来干革命
    日本革命工农积极参加毛主席著作学习班努力学习毛泽东思想
    新华社十三日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本的革命工人和农民，为了更好地同帝修反进行斗争，正在努力学习毛主席著作。
    日本福冈县大牟田市有一个毛主席著作学习班。参加学习的有三池煤矿的矿工、汽车司机和附近小学的教师，共三十多人。他们从去年秋天组成这个学习班以后，坚持了定期召开学习讨论会。每逢召开讨论会的时候，学员们都手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，朗读毛主席语录。有时，讨论会热烈地开到深夜。
    在不久前召开的一次讨论会上，参加反对美国核航空母舰闯入佐世保斗争的三池煤矿工人藤泽说：要想革命就必须用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，如果不是这样，就不会成为为了人民的利益不怕牺牲、艰苦奋斗的革命战士。他说，在高涨的反美爱国斗争中，日共宫本修正主义集团企图扑灭人民斗争的怒火，许多事实证明了它们是可耻的叛徒。
    另外一位三池煤矿的工人指出，目前，日本垄断资本同美帝国主义已经紧紧地勾结在一起，对工人进行残酷的压榨。日本革命人民只有按照毛泽东思想干革命，才能打倒骑在他们头上的敌人。
    一位工会会员说，按照毛主席的教导，要想成为一个真正的革命者，必须彻底改造自己的世界观。只有不怕困难，不怕牺牲，艰苦奋斗，站在人民群众斗争的最前列，才能把革命坚持到底。
    汽车司机田上说：毛泽东思想给日本人民指出了革命的道路，这是毛主席对日本人民的最大支持和鼓舞。我们只有在毛泽东思想指引的道路上前进，才能取得日本革命的胜利。
    近年来，千叶县三里塚的农民同其他革命群众一起，坚决反对佐藤政府修建“新国际机场”为美帝扩大侵略战争效劳。在最近几次斗争中，他们在三里塚贴出的大幅标语有：
  “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“工人、农民和学生团结万岁！”“胜利必定属于坚持斗争的革命人民！”等等。
    三里塚的一个农民说：“毛主席教导我们：‘坚持下去就是胜利。’只要我们不怕牺牲，不怕困难，坚决地同工人和学生一起坚持斗争，我们一定会获得最后胜利。”
      一位佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章的老人说，戴上了毛主席像章，使我在对敌战斗时充满了勇气。
    一位青年农民说，毛泽东思想是战胜敌人的最强大思想武器。我们同中国人民团结一致，同世界人民团结一致，一定能把我们的斗争进行到底，直到彻底打倒美帝国主义及其帮凶。
    最近在一次斗争中，三里塚反对修建机场农民联盟委员长户村一作深有体会地说，我们要认真地学习毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想运用到斗争实践中去。
