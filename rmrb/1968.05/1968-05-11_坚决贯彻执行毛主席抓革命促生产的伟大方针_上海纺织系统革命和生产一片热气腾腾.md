The textile system in Shanghai is brimming with revolutionary fervor and production enthusiasm.

Since the beginning of this year, the total output value of Shanghai's textile industry has increased month by month. The production of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed fabric, wool, towels, bed sheets, knitted products, and silk products has significantly increased, the quality has continuously improved, and there have been many new varieties and styles. Especially since April, the production situation has been even better. More than ten percent of the factories in the city, belonging to the cotton spinning, dyeing, weaving, knitting, and wool and hemp textile departments, have surpassed their historical production peaks. Many factories have seen a significant increase in product output and value compared to the same period last year. Many factories have also carried out extensive technical innovations and technological revolutions, adopting a batch of new processes, new technologies, and new equipment, pushing Shanghai's textile industry's production technology level to a new height.

The great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and "the need to tighten control over cloth production" have guided the revolutionary path of the broad revolutionary workers in Shanghai's textile industry. In the thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread across the city's textile factories, the broad revolutionary workers, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have deeply thought about Chairman Mao's immense care for textile workers, discussed the broad revolutionary masses' ardent expectations for textile workers, talked about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and enumerated the favorable conditions created by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution for developing production. They have severely criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. The broad revolutionary workers regard the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" as an important symbol of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is also a heavy blow to China's Khrushchev and his agents. The revolutionary cadres of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, who have made important contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region, have closely united with the broad revolutionary masses and fought together, making the revolution and production in the entire factory flourish. The broad revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Mill, who have always maintained an advanced level of production, have pooled their wisdom and efforts to tap into production potential, breaking historical production records in April this year. The broad revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 2 Dyeing Factory, which had relatively backward production before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have severely criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, strengthened cooperation among workshops, helped and learned from each other, and competed with each other, quickly propelling the entire factory into the ranks of the city's advanced factories.

In the battle to grasp the revolution and promote production, the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers in Shanghai's textile industry have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to continuously launch attacks on class enemies, resolutely smashing the sabotage activities of class enemies, and achieving double victories in revolution and production. After the revolutionary committees at various levels in the textile system were established, the broad revolutionary workers, under the guidance of the PLA's support personnel, have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and continuously launched fierce attacks on class enemies. The revolutionary cadres in Shanghai's textile industry have realized that one of the important tactics class enemies use against us is to sabotage production to sabotage the revolution. In units where the counter-revolutionary economicism and anarchism winds blow fiercely, revolutionary cadres under the leadership of the revolutionary committees and the help of the PLA's support personnel have exposed the class struggle, united the broad masses, and severely struck the sabotage activities of class enemies. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The revolutionary cadres have taken the initiative in class struggle, with the heroic spirit of overwhelming all enemies, continuously and fiercely launching attacks on class enemies, and the revolutionary and production situation has immediately and rapidly developed.

Under the help of the PLA's support personnel, the broad revolutionary workers have closely linked the revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in their units, with the tasks of each period, and with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their units. Through the revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary workers have been greatly enhanced, promoting the development of production. Some factories in Shanghai's dyeing industry originally had some unreasonable old regulations that severely constrained the socialist production enthusiasm of revolutionary workers and also affected product quality. Revolutionary workers, through revolutionary criticism, recognized that these regulations were China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, carried out mass movements, and reformed these old regulations. In April, the output and total value of products in this industry both exceeded historical records.

In leading the battle to grasp the revolution and promote production, the revolutionary committees at various levels in Shanghai's textile industry have emphasized proletarian politics, closely linked with the masses, been full of vigor and vitality, and been decisive and swift, fully demonstrating the great fighting power of the three-in-one revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Mill, with a high sense of responsibility as masters of the state, have shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. While deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, they have firmly guarded their production posts, exerted their utmost efforts, and striven to be the best, producing a large number of cotton textile products for the state.

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席抓革命促生产的伟大方针
    上海纺织系统革命和生产一片热气腾腾
    广大革命职工在解放军帮助下，把革命大批判和本单位阶级斗争实际紧密结合，狠狠打击敌人，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，推动了生产发展。今年以来，总产值月月增长，产品产量大幅度上升，质量不断提高，花色品种也有不少增加
    新华社上海十日电　上海纺织工业系统的广大革命职工，在人民解放军海军支左人员的支持和帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    今年以来，上海纺织工业系统的总产值月月增长，棉纱、棉布、印染布、呢绒、毛巾、被单、针织品和丝织品等产品的产量大幅度上升，质量不断提高，新花色，新品种也有不少增加。特别是四月份以来，生产情况更好。全市分属于棉纺、印染、织造、针织和毛麻纺织等部门的百分之十以上的工厂，生产超过了历史上的最高水平。一大批工厂的产品产量和产值，比去年同期有了大幅度增长。许多工厂还大搞技术革新和技术革命，采用了一批新工艺、新技术、新装备，使上海纺织工业的生产技术水平又向前跨进了一步。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”和“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大指示，指引着上海纺织工业系统广大革命职工前进的方向。在遍及全市纺织工厂的成千上万个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班里，广大革命职工怀着对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，大想毛主席对纺织工人的巨大关怀，大谈广大革命群众对纺织工人的殷切期望，大讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大摆无产阶级文化大革命为发展生产创造的有利条件，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的滔天罪行，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。广大革命职工把坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，看作是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志，看作是对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的沉重打击。为上海地区无产阶级文化大革命运动作出重要贡献的上海国棉十七厂的无产阶级革命派，紧紧地团结广大革命群众，共同战斗，全厂革命、生产蒸蒸日上。生产一直保持先进水平的上海国棉五厂的广大革命职工，群策群力，大挖生产潜力，今年四月份的生产水平打破了历史上最高纪录。无产阶级文化大革命以前生产比较后进的上海第二印染厂的广大革命职工，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，各车间加强协作，你帮我学，你追我赶，使全厂迅速跃入了全市先进工厂的行列。
    上海纺织工业系统的广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工在抓革命、促生产的战斗中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。在纺织系统各级革命委员会相继建立以后，广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，持续地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。上海纺织工业系统的无产阶级革命派认识到，现在阶级敌人对付我们的一个重要手法，就是以破坏生产来破坏革命。在那些反革命经济主义和无政府主义妖风刮得厉害的单位，无产阶级革命派战士们在革命委员会的领导和解放军支左人员的帮助下，大揭阶级斗争盖子，团结广大群众，狠狠地打击阶级敌人的破坏活动。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”无产阶级革命派掌握了阶级斗争的主动权，以压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，向阶级敌人持续地猛烈地发动进攻，革命生产形势就立即迅猛向前发展。
    广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，把革命大批判同本单位阶级斗争实际紧密结合起来，同每个时期的任务紧密结合起来，同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。通过革命的大批判，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，推动了生产的发展。上海印染行业的一些工厂，原来的一些不合理的旧规章严重束缚革命职工的社会主义生产积极性，也影响产品质量。革命职工们通过革命大批判，认识到这一些规章是中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货。他们遵照毛主席的教导，大搞群众运动，改革了这些旧规章。四月份，这个行业的产品产量和总产值，都超过了历史的最高水平。
    上海纺织工业系统的各级革命委员会在领导抓革命、促生产的战斗中，突出无产阶级政治，密切联系群众，朝气蓬勃，雷厉风行，充分显示了三结合的革命委员会的巨大战斗力。（附图片）
