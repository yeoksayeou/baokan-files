Despite the fascist repression and persecution by the American ruling class, the struggle by progressive students in the United States to oppose the reactionary educational system, to oppose racial discrimination, and to fight for student democratic rights continues to surge.

In Columbia University, which led the charge in this struggle, the student protest and demonstration activities that have been ongoing for eighteen days are still continuing. Under the joint pressure of black and white students, the school authorities have been forced to halt the construction of a sports stadium in a park in the black neighborhood of Harlem.

At Roosevelt University in Chicago, the struggle by students to protest the school administration's refusal to hire a professor who opposes the Vietnam War has been ongoing for five days as of the 10th. A group of students occupied the dean's office on the night of the 9th to hold a sit-in demonstration, and were subsequently expelled by the reactionary school authorities, sparking great outrage among the students. That same night, over a hundred more students rushed to the dean's office to hold a sit-in demonstration. The school authorities then called in the police to forcibly disperse the demonstrators, and eleven demonstrators were taken away in police cars. The struggle continues to this day. The demonstrators emphasized that the issue is not just about hiring or not hiring a certain professor, but about students demanding greater speaking rights within the school.

At Stanford University near San Francisco, the school authorities' unjustified suspension of the academic records of seven students who participated in last autumn's demonstration against the Central Intelligence Agency's recruitment of agents has met with strong student protests. Several hundred students occupied the dean's office on the night of the 6th, holding a sit-in demonstration for three consecutive days, forcing the school authorities to announce on the night of the 9th that they would revoke the suspension of the seven students' academic records and guarantee that those who occupied the dean's office would not be punished. The school authorities were also forced to agree that in the future, student representatives should be present when discussing and handling student issues. The students' struggle has gained the support of the majority of the faculty and staff.

Additionally, at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, students held demonstrations demanding the takeover of the school's newspaper and broadcasting station. Several hundred students were beaten by police as they rushed towards the dean's office, with at least two students injured.

The vigorous development of the progressive student movement has made the American ruling class extremely irritated. On one hand, they are carrying out naked fascist repression against the students participating in the struggle. On the other hand, Congress is passing a bill attempting to threaten university students with the "revocation of the right to receive federal scholarships" if they participate in the progressive student movement. However, the fascist high-pressure tactics of the Johnson administration will only further awaken American university students politically and inspire more people to join the struggle.

### 不顾统治集团镇压迫害　坚持争取民主权利斗争  美国进步学生运动继续高涨

    不顾统治集团镇压迫害　坚持争取民主权利斗争
    美国进步学生运动继续高涨
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾美国统治集团的法西斯镇压和迫害，美国进步学生为反对反动的教育制度、反对种族歧视、争取学生民主权利而掀起的斗争浪潮，正在继续高涨。
    在带头掀起这场斗争的纽约哥伦比亚大学，持续已达十八天的学生抗议示威活动仍在坚持中。在黑人学生和白人学生共同斗争的压力下，学校当局原来占用哈莱姆黑人区的公园来建筑体育馆的工程已被迫停止。
    在芝加哥的罗斯福大学，学生为了抗议校方拒绝聘用一位反对侵越战争的教授而掀起的斗争，到十日为止已经持续第五天。一批学生在九日晚上进占校长办公室举行静坐示威，遭到反动的学校当局开除，激起了学生极大的愤怒。当天晚上又有一百多名学生涌往校长室举行静坐示威。结果校方招来警察强行驱散示威学生，并把十一名示威者架上囚车带走。目前斗争仍在继续中。示威学生强调，问题不仅仅在于聘不聘用某个教授，而是在于学生要求在校内获得更大的发言权。
    在旧金山附近的史坦福大学，校方无理停止在去年秋天示威中反对中央情报局招募员的七名学生的学籍，遭到了学生的强烈抗议。数百名学生六日晚上占领了校长办公室，在那里举行了连续三天的静坐示威，迫使校方在九日晚间宣布收回对七名学生停止学籍的决定，并保证不处分进占校长室的学生。学校当局还被迫同意，今后在讨论处理学生问题时，应有学生代表出席。学生的斗争获得了大多数教职员的支持。
    另外，在伊利诺斯州卡尔邦戴马的南伊利诺斯大学，学生举行示威，要求接管学校的报纸和播音室。数百名学生在冲向校长室时，遭到警察毒打，至少有两名学生被打伤。
    进步学生运动的蓬勃发展使美国统治集团十分恼火。它一方面对参加斗争的学生实行赤裸裸的法西斯镇压，另一方面国会正在通过一项法案，妄图以“取消领取联邦助学金的权利”来威胁大学生不得参加进步学生运动。但是约翰逊政府的法西斯高压手段，势将更加促进美国大学生在政治上的觉醒，激励更多人投入斗争。
