Fight, Revolutionary People of France!

“Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of French workers and students!”

“Workers of the world, unite!”

“Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the reactionaries of all countries!”

In the past two days, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses from various sectors in the capital and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have, in grand demonstrations, voiced their sentiments filled with proletarian internationalism.

The news of the French working class and young students launching a fierce offensive against the French reactionaries has spread across Beijing like a spring breeze, stirring the hearts of the revolutionary people of the capital. In recent days, workers, students, cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from the capital have taken to the streets in demonstrations, expressing their strongest support for the Paris Commune's glorious descendants, the fighting French revolutionary people. The various demonstration columns, from the city's districts and suburbs, have surged towards the city center. They held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs, and shouted revolutionary slogans, gathering in Tiananmen Square in wave after wave of revolutionary torrents.

The working class of the capital is closely tied to the French working class. They see the struggle of their French working-class brothers as their own struggle and view the victory of their French working-class brothers as their own victory. The miners of the Beijing Mining Bureau, after finishing their night shift without rest, came to Tiananmen Square in high spirits from the distant suburbs. They warmly praised the heroic struggle of the French working-class brothers. They said, France's workers' revolutionary struggle storm has dealt a heavy blow to France's monopoly capital and the French reactionaries. The vigorous rise of the people's movements in Western Europe and North America is an important sign of the current good situation in the world revolution. It fully proves the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening."

The capital's railway workers, who have the glorious revolutionary tradition of "February 7," and the famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew members, when talking about the heroic struggle of French railway workers seizing stations, said excitedly, "The French workers' revolutionary rebellion is excellent! We firmly support it!" The workers of the Beijing Red East Wind Automobile Factory, upon hearing that workers in various automobile factories in France have played a vanguard role in the struggle and that more than sixty thousand workers of France's largest Renault Automobile Company have seized the factories of this company, were very excited. They immediately took action, posting slogans in the factory and surging onto the streets to hold demonstrations. They said, "Although China and France are separated by vast oceans, the hearts of the working classes of the two countries are very close, as if we are fighting side by side. We vow to be the strong backing of French workers. We firmly believe that as long as French workers persist in their struggle, they will definitely achieve victory." The workers of the Second Cotton Mill said, "The French workers' revolutionary actions of seizing factories and detaining capitalists are heartening news. They expressed their firm support for the French people's revolutionary struggle.

“Long live the great revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune!” This is a common slogan echoing through the various demonstration columns. The capital's power workers said, The French proletariat has a glorious revolutionary tradition. In 1871, they overthrew the reactionary rule of the French bourgeoisie and established the first proletarian government in history—the Paris Commune. This was the first attempt by the proletariat to seize power. After the Second World War, France once had a very good revolutionary situation. However, the French revisionist clique sold the victory fruits won by the French people with their blood to the reactionaries, burying the French revolutionary cause. Now, the French working class has kicked out the revisionist scabs and traitors and resolutely started the revolution. This shows that the spark of the Paris Commune has been reignited in Paris. Many workers and Red Guards participating in the demonstrations in the capital expressed their belief that as long as the French proletariat inherits the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, perseveres, and continues the struggle, they will definitely be able to bury the evil capitalist system!

Just as the revolutionary struggles of workers and students in Europe and North America are surging, the modern revisionists, with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as their representatives, have jumped out to support the French reactionaries, acting as their henchmen to suppress the revolutionary people. The Soviet revisionist "Pravda" newspaper shamelessly slandered the Paris demonstrators as engaging in "rebellious actions." The French revisionist traitor clique not only opposes French workers seizing factories but even demands that workers release the detained capitalists. The broad revolutionary workers, students, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the capital are extremely indignant at the treacherous actions of the Soviet and French revisionists.

An old worker with forty-one years of service at the Beijing Knitting Factory said excitedly, "Modern revisionists breathe the same air as the imperialist reactionaries and are most afraid of workers rising up to rebel against them. They want to use economic bribery to numb the workers' fighting spirit and quell the strike struggles. They are thorough scabs and traitors." A worker from the knitting section and a driver said: We firmly believe that no matter what counter-revolutionary tricks the Soviet and French revisionists use, they cannot stop the surging revolutionary struggle of the French working class and young students who are rich in revolutionary traditions.

The broad revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the capital unanimously pointed out: The revolutionary struggle of French workers and students powerfully proves the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many Red Guards participating in the demonstrations said that when they heard the news of French students bravely fighting under the banner of revolutionary rebellion, they felt particularly excited. Soldiers of a certain company guarding in front of Tiananmen said: More than a year ago, we witnessed here the historic scene of the great leader Chairman Mao receiving the cultural revolution army. At that time, the Red Guards and the broad proletarian revolutionary factions, under Chairman Mao's battle call, charged forward with an irresistible force against the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, achieving one great victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, we see again in the same place the revolutionary masses of the capital holding a grand demonstration, supporting the revolutionary rebellion of French workers and students, supporting the just struggle of the people of Europe and North America. This not only shows the good situation of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also shows that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting the rapid development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

Fight, glorious descendants of the Paris Commune! Advance, brave French revolutionary people! The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly support you!

    战斗吧，法国的革命人民！
    “坚决支持法国工人、学生的革命斗争！”
    “全世界无产者，联合起来！”
    “打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！”
    首都各界数十万革命群众和人民解放军指战员，在两天来的盛大示威游行中，发出了充满无产阶级国际主义精神的声音。
    法国工人阶级和青年学生向法国反动派展开猛烈进攻的消息，象春风一样传遍了整个北京，激动着首都广大革命人民的心。连日来，首都工人、学生、干部和人民解放军指战员纷纷走上街头示威游行，向巴黎公社的光荣后代、战斗中的法国革命人民表示最有力的声援。各路游行队伍，从城内各区和郊外浩浩荡荡奔向市中心。他们举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐唱革命歌曲，高呼革命口号，在天安门广场上汇集成一股又一股的革命洪流。
    首都工人阶级同法国阶级兄弟息息相关。他们把法国工人兄弟的斗争看作自己的斗争，把法国工人兄弟的胜利看作自己的胜利。北京矿务局的矿工们，下了晚班没有休息，就怀着高昂的革命热情，从远郊区列队来到天安门广场。他们热烈赞扬法国工人兄弟的英勇斗争。他们说，法国工人革命斗争的风暴给了法国垄断资本和法国反动派以沉重的打击。帝国主义的老巢西欧、北美的人民运动的蓬勃兴起，是当前世界革命形势大好的一个重要标志。它充分地证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。”
    具有“二·七”革命光荣传统的首都铁路工人和著名的“毛泽东号”机车包乘组的同志们，在谈到法国铁路罢工工人占领车站的英勇斗争时激动地说，法国工人的革命造反行动好得很！我们坚决支持！北京东方红汽车制造厂的工人听到法国各地汽车制造厂的工人在斗争中起了先锋作用、听到法国最大的雷诺汽车公司的六万多工人占领了这个公司所属工厂的消息，都感到非常兴奋。他们立即行动起来，在厂内张贴标语，并且纷纷涌向街头举行示威游行。他们说，中国和法国虽然远隔重洋，但中法两国工人阶级的心却靠得很近，好象我们正在并肩战斗。我们誓作法国工人的坚强后盾。我们坚信法国工人只要坚持斗争，就一定能够取得胜利。国棉二厂的工人说，法国工人占领工厂、扣留资本家的革命行动是大快人心的消息。他们表示坚决支持法国人民的革命斗争。
    “伟大的巴黎公社革命传统万岁！”这是响遍各个游行队伍的一个共同的口号。首都电业工人说，法国无产阶级具有光荣的革命传统。他们在一八七一年曾经推翻了法国资产阶级的反动统治，建立过有史以来的第一个无产阶级的政权——巴黎公社。这是无产阶级夺取政权的第一次尝试。第二次世界大战以后，法国曾经出现过大好的革命形势。但是法国修正主义集团把法国人民用鲜血换来的胜利果实双手出卖给反动派，葬送了法国的革命事业。现在法国工人阶级踢开了修正主义工贼和叛徒，坚决起来闹革命。这表明，巴黎公社的火种又在巴黎重新点燃了起来。首都许多参加示威游行的工人、红卫兵小将表示深信，法国无产阶级只要继承巴黎公社的革命传统，再接再厉，坚持斗争，就一定能够把万恶的资本主义制度埋葬掉！
    正当欧洲、北美工人和学生的革命斗争蓬勃兴起的时候，以苏修叛徒集团为代表的现代修正主义者竟然跳出来为法国反动派帮腔，充当他们镇压革命人民的打手。苏修《真理报》无耻地诬蔑巴黎示威学生搞的是“叛乱行动”。法修叛徒集团不仅反对法国工人占领工厂，甚至还要工人释放被扣留的资本家。首都广大的革命工人、学生和人民解放军战士对于苏修和法修的这种叛卖行径表示极大的愤慨。
    北京针织总厂一位有四十一年工龄的老工人激动地说：“现代修正主义者同帝国主义反动派一鼻孔出气，最怕工人起来造他们的反。他们想用经济收买手段来麻痹工人斗志，平息罢工斗争，他们是彻头彻尾的工贼和叛徒。”经编车间的一位工人和一位汽车司机说：我们深信，苏修和法修的任何反革命伎俩，都阻挡不了富有革命传统的法国工人阶级和青年学生的革命斗争的洪流奔腾向前。
    首都广大革命群众和人民解放军战士一致指出：法国工人、学生的革命斗争有力地证明了毛泽东思想的巨大威力和中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响。参加示威游行的许多红卫兵小将说，当他们听到法国学生高举革命造反的大旗英勇战斗的消息时，感到特别兴奋。守卫在天安门前的解放军某部一连的战士说：一年多前，我们在这里曾经亲眼看见过伟大领袖毛主席接见文化革命大军的历史场面。当时，红卫兵小将和广大无产阶级革命派在毛主席的战斗号召下，以排山倒海之势向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部进行冲锋陷阵，取得了无产阶级文化大革命一个又一个的伟大胜利。今天，我们在同一个地方又看到了首都革命群众举行声势浩大的示威游行，支持法国工人、学生的革命造反行动，支持欧洲、北美人民的正义斗争。这不但说明我国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，而且说明了在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在有力地推动着世界各国人民革命斗争的迅速发展。
    战斗吧，巴黎公社的光荣后代们！前进吧，英勇的法国革命人民！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民坚决支持你们！　本报记者
