	Uruguay's over 200,000 public utility workers and civil servants went on a 48-hour general strike on the 16th to protest the government's economic policies and soaring prices, demanding wage increases and improved social welfare benefits.

	This strike brought work in the country's railways, banks, power, aviation, health, and fuel sectors to a halt, paralyzing government departments. Most regions in the country were without power, external telegraphic communications were completely cut off, and television and radio broadcasts were suspended.

	The Uruguayan authorities, implementing economic policies imposed by the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund, have exacerbated inflation and economic deterioration, making people's lives increasingly difficult. The Uruguayan government had devalued its currency seven times last year. At the end of April this year, the government announced a further 25% devaluation of the Uruguayan peso. Last year, living expenses rose by 135%, and in the first quarter of this year, they increased by nearly 30%. To safeguard their right to live, Uruguay's workers have been staging strikes throughout the year.

	Additionally, students in the capital protested against the increase in public bus fares with a six-day demonstration. They barricaded streets, threw stones at buses, and clashed with the police. On the 16th, the authorities were forced to agree not to raise the fares.

    乌拉圭二十多万工人和公务员总罢工
    全国铁路电力等部门工作停顿，政府部门陷于瘫痪
    新华社讯　蒙得维的亚消息：为抗议政府的经济政策和物价猛烈上涨，要求增加工资和改善社会福利待遇，乌拉圭全国二十多万名国营公用事业工人和公务员十六日又一次举行四十八小时总罢工。
    这次总罢工使全国铁路、银行、电力、航空、卫生、燃料等部门的工作停顿，政府部门也陷于瘫痪。国内绝大部分地区没有电力供应，对外的电讯联系完全中断，电视、无线电台也停止广播。
    乌拉圭当局由于执行美国控制的国际货币基金组织所强加的经济政策，加剧了通货膨胀和经济恶化，人民生活越来越困苦。乌拉圭官方去年曾经先后七次宣布货币贬值。今年四月底，政府又宣布乌拉圭比索进一步贬值百分之二十五。去年一年生活费用上涨百分之一百三十五，今年第一季度又上涨将近百分之三十。乌拉圭广大工人群众为保障生存权利，今年以来不断开展罢工斗争。
    此外，乌拉圭首都学生为抗议公共汽车车票涨价，举行了长达六天的示威活动，他们在大街上筑起街垒，向公共汽车扔石头，并同警察展开了斗争。十六日，当局被迫同意车票暂不加价。
