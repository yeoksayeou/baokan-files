The PLA in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province, and the county's military affairs department have deeply felt the great truth and profound significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must believe that more than 90% of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be reformed." In the past period, they have helped the revolutionary masses set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, correctly handle cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, warmly help cadres stand up to revolutionize, and actively support cadres to work boldly. This has powerfully promoted the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination. In early March, the county revolutionary committee and the revolutionary committees of all 18 communes and 2 towns were established one after another, making the entire county red, and the revolution and production are booming.

Helping Cadres Stand Up in the Struggle of the Masses

At the beginning, some cadres did not dare to stand up proactively, fearing that the masses would not trust them. Some cadres thought their problems were minor and that the masses would invite them to participate in the three-in-one combination. To address these active thoughts among the cadres, the PLA and the revolutionary masses organized the cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's teaching: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." After studying, the cadres raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They realized that in the struggle between the two lines, it is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line whether to stand up proactively or wait for the masses to invite them. Therefore, they voluntarily went among the masses, checked their mistakes, accepted the masses' criticism, and gained the masses' understanding and trust. Wang Wanshun, a former member of the county committee and director of the financial and commercial political department, implemented the capitalist reactionary line at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution and was impacted by the mass movement. He had intense inner struggles and was prepared to "retire from the battlefield." The PLA personnel and revolutionary masses addressed his ideological issues, helping him correctly handle the mass movement and correctly handle himself. They helped him bring his ideological problems to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. During the study, he used Chairman Mao's instructions to examine himself and was shocked to find that he had stood on the opposite side of the mass movement. He decided to correct his mistakes and voluntarily went three times to the financial bureau, where opinions about him were the strongest, to check his mistakes and listen to the masses' criticism, gaining their understanding. Everyone was very enthusiastic with him and fought against selfishness and revisionism together.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the storm of mass struggle, and this world is the world of mass struggle." The PLA and revolutionary masses in Jiangyong County, following Chairman Mao's teachings, organized cadres in mid-December last year to go to seven communes and 18 production brigades to set up "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using the countryside as a classroom and poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers. Over 14,000 people participated in this study class. This study class created good conditions for revolutionary cadres to go among the masses, powerfully promoting the thought revolutionization of cadres. The directors of county bureaus and departments and the first and second-in-command of communes ate, lived, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, recalling bitterness and sweetness together, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism together. These cadres saw with their own eyes the poor and lower-middle peasants' deepest love for Chairman Mao and their deepest hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Due to close contact with the masses, touching the actual struggle, and listening to the masses' criticism, the cadres raised their ideological awareness, put down their burdens, and voluntarily stood up to revolutionize. Meng Zhaorong, a former deputy secretary of the county procuratorate, is an old soldier who has been in the revolution for 30 years. During the Cultural Revolution, he implemented the capitalist reactionary line and had a heavy burden. After studying in the "three-in-one combination" study class, he said painfully: "In the past, I was blinded and deceived by the 'self' character, failing to see the struggle between the two lines in my mind. This time, Chairman Mao saved me, and the revolutionary masses helped me. If I don't work hard for the revolution, I will forget my roots."

Through this study, everyone deeply felt that to make cadres truly stand up, we must help cadres get out of the offices and go to the mass struggle and class struggle to experience storms and see the world, letting cadres recognize and correct their mistakes in the struggle practice, fundamentally raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. If we let cadres sit in the room writing self-criticisms all day, isolating them from the masses, it will be difficult for them to truly stand up. Letting Cadres Correct Mistakes in Struggle Practice

The PLA and revolutionary masses actively supported cadres to work boldly, letting cadres make up for their mistakes in work. At the beginning, some revolutionary masses could not understand, saying: "The rebels fight for the sky, and the authorities sit on the sky." Some were concerned that this would not help cadres correct their mistakes. The PLA and revolutionary masses addressed these active thoughts, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's cadre policy, raising everyone's understanding, and clarifying the relationship between work and correcting mistakes. With the strong support of the PLA personnel and revolutionary masses, the county organized over 150 deputy bureau directors and deputy secretaries of communes and above to come out to work, participating in the temporary production leadership teams and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of the three-in-one combination. This not only helps to seize the revolution and promote production but also creates conditions for a large number of relatively good cadres to stand up, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, and promote the three-in-one combination. There was a female deputy county magistrate who, before the Cultural Revolution, had a non-diligent work style and was not closely connected with the masses. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, she implemented the capitalist reactionary line. Although she made a self-criticism, the masses still had opinions. To create conditions for her to correct her mistakes, the PLA and revolutionary masses repeatedly invited her to participate in the county's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and placed her in areas with complex class struggles and harsh living conditions. In this period of work, she actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, correcting mistakes while working, not fearing difficulties in work or hardships in life, actively working hard, gaining the masses' understanding and trust, and now actively participating in the production command department's work.

From this, everyone felt that only by believing in and relying on the majority of cadres can we correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The vast majority of cadres are good or relatively good and want to revolutionize. The bad elements are only a small handful. We should correctly handle the two types of different nature contradictions, let cadres participate in work, correct mistakes while working, make up for mistakes, and stand up to revolutionize in work practice.

    江永县支左解放军努力做好群众和干部的思想政治工作
    用毛泽东思想正确地对待干部
    县和公社、镇革命委员会先后成立，革命力量不断壮大，全县抓革命促生产热气腾腾
    本报讯　毛主席教导我们：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”湖南省江永县支左部队和县人武部，从自己的工作实践中，充分体会到毛主席的这一教导是伟大的真理，具有极其深刻的意义。在过去一段时间，他们帮助无产阶级革命派大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想正确对待干部，热情帮助干部站出来革命，积极支持干部大胆工作，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。三月上旬，县革命委员会和全县十八个公社、两个镇的革委会先后成立，全县实现了一片红，革命和生产搞得热气腾腾。帮助干部在群众斗争中站出来
    开始，有些干部不敢主动站出来，怕群众不信任。还有些干部自认为问题不大，打不倒，到时候群众就会请自己参加三结合。针对干部的这些活思想，支左部队和无产阶级革命派，组织干部认真地学习毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”经过学习，干部们提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们认识到：在两条路线斗争中站在哪一边，是主动站出来还是要群众请出来，这是忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。于是，他们就自觉地到群众中去，检查错误，接受群众的批评，取得了群众的谅解和信任。原县委常委、财贸政治部主任王万顺，在文化大革命初期，执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到群众运动的冲击。他思想斗争十分激烈，准备“解甲归田”。支左人员和无产阶级革命派针对他的思想问题，着重帮助他正确地对待群众运动，正确地对待自己，帮助他带着自己思想上的问题，学习毛主席的最新指示。在学习中，他用毛主席的指示来检查自己，结果大吃一惊：原来自己站到群众运动的对立面去了。他决心改正自己的错误，便主动地三次到对他意见最大的财政局去检查自己的错误，听取群众的批评，取得了群众的谅解。大家对他很热情，和他一起斗私批修。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”江永县的支左部队和无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席的教导，在去年十二月上旬，组织干部分别下到七个公社、十八个大队去办“三结合”的毛泽东思想学习班，以农村为课堂，以贫下中农为老师。参加这次学习班的共一万四千多人。这次学习班，为革命干部深入群众创造了良好的条件，有力地促进了干部的思想革命化。县机关科局长和公社正副书记以上领导干部，和贫下中农同吃，同住，同劳动，一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修。这些干部亲眼看到了贫下中农对毛主席最热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫最仇恨。由于在学习班密切联系群众，接触斗争实际，倾听群众批评，干部提高了思想觉悟，放下了包袱，纷纷站出来革命。原县监委副书记孟兆荣，是个参加革命三十年的老战士，文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，包袱重。他在“三结合”学习班学习之后，沉痛地说：“过去，我是被‘私’字迷了窍，蒙了眼，看不到自己头脑里存在两条路线斗争。这次，毛主席救了我，革命群众帮助了我，我再不好好干革命，就是忘了本。”
    通过这次学习，大家深深体会到：要使干部真正站出来，必须帮助干部走出机关，走出办公室，到群众斗争、阶级斗争中去经风雨，见世面，让干部在斗争实践中认识自己的错误，改正自己的错误，从根本上提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。如果让干部整天坐在房子里写检查，和群众隔离，那是不容易真正站出来的。让干部在斗争实践中改正错误
    支左部队和无产阶级革命派积极支持干部大胆工作，让干部在工作中将功补过。开始，有些革命群众想不通，他们说：“造反派打天下，当权派坐天下。”还有人担心这样做，干部不会改正错误。支左部队和无产阶级革命派针对这些活思想，又组织大家学习毛主席的干部政策，提高大家的认识，明确了工作与改正错误的关系。在支左人员和革命群众的大力支持下，全县组织了机关副科长和公社副书记以上领导干部一百五十多人出来抓工作，参加“三结合”的临时生产领导班子和毛泽东思想宣传队。这样做，不仅有利于抓革命、促生产，而且为促进大批较好干部站出来，巩固和发展革命大联合，促进革命三结合创造了条件。有个副县长是女同志，文化大革命前，工作作风不艰苦，联系群众不够，文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，虽然作了检查，但群众仍有意见。为了给她创造改正错误的条件，支左部队和无产阶级革命派，多次吸收她参加县里的毛泽东思想宣传队，并把她放在阶级斗争复杂、生活条件艰苦的地区工作。在这一段工作中，她活学活用毛泽东思想，边工作边改正错误，工作不怕难，生活不怕苦，积极肯干，得到了群众的谅解和信任，现已积极站出来参加生产指挥部的工作。
    从这件事大家体会到，只有相信和依靠干部的大多数，才能正确地执行毛主席的干部政策。绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的，是要革命的，坏人只是一小撮。应当正确地处理两类不同性质的矛盾，让干部参加工作，边工作边改正错误，将功补过，在工作实践中站出来革命。
