Two years have passed since the issuance of the historic document, the "May 16 Circular" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of this epoch-making document, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev.

"Sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat," the revolutionary criticism has been irresistible and unstoppable, cleansing all the dirt and filth left over from the old society.

The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought has blown across the entire country, and the vast land is radiant with red light. From the mountains to the plains, from the cities to the countryside, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been widely established. Everywhere are classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and everywhere are battlefields for criticizing China's Khrushchev. People's spiritual faces have undergone tremendous changes. The following are a few small stories from the borderlands of our motherland.

    塞外河山展新容
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发出两周年了。两年来，在这划时代的文献的指引下，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底揭露和批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派及其推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    “横扫千军如卷席”，革命的大批判势如破竹，锐不可挡，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。
    毛泽东思想的春风吹遍了祖国大地，万里江山红光闪耀。从高山到平原，从城市到农村，普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，到处是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，到处是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。这里介绍的是在祖国塞外的几个小故事。
