Workers in France, numbering over eight million, have gone on a massive strike. Workers have taken over more than 300 key factories and mines. Rail, air, and sea transportation have come to a halt. Banks and post offices have closed. The entire country's economic life is in chaos. The French government is in a state of panic. Workers have kicked aside the obstacles set by the French Communist Party (French Communist Party) and are fighting side by side with students. The flames of struggle are burning brighter, shaking the entire continent of Europe.

New China News Agency, May 21: Paris reports that the political and economic strike of the French working class, like a raging wildfire, is spreading rapidly across all of France. By May 21, the number of strikers had exceeded eight million. Workers have taken over more than 300 key factories and mines. Rail, air, and sea transportation in France have come to a halt, and banks and post offices have closed. The entire country's economic life is in chaos. The struggle of the French working class is fiercely striking the reactionary rule of the French monopoly bourgeoisie, shaking the entire continent of Europe.

The outbreak of this unprecedented strike in France is the result of the intensification of class contradictions within the country. As the political and economic crises in the capitalist world deepen, French production has stagnated, and the monopoly bourgeoisie is increasingly shifting the crisis onto the working class. The French workers' dissatisfaction with their miserable lives and the rotten capitalist system has been growing. Under the influence and inspiration of the unprecedented surge in the student movement in France, the immense resentment hidden within the French workers has erupted into a raging inferno.

The development of this strike in France has been extraordinarily rapid. According to reports from Western news agencies, on the morning of May 17, only 100,000 workers were on strike, but by the afternoon, the number had reached 500,000. By the morning of May 19, the number had exceeded 2 million, and by the morning of May 21, it had reached over 8 million, surpassing half of the total 15 million workers and public sector employees in France. In just four or five days, the strike wave has swept across more than 90 provinces in France, paralyzing the country's transportation, postal services, and a significant portion of its industrial and mining enterprises.

It is worth noting that this massive strike originated from the grassroots level of industrial and mining enterprises. Under the influence of the student struggle, a group of workers in French factories, in order to defend their immediate interests, defied the orders of the higher-level yellow unions and resolutely went on strike. More and more workers followed suit, and within a few days, the situation developed into a nationwide general strike. The rebellious French workers have set aside the leaders of the French Communist Party and other yellow unions.

In this struggle, more and more French workers, despite the opposition of the yellow union leaders, have broken through the old rules of strikes and, in a combative posture, have taken over a large number of factories, mines, and enterprises, detaining their daily exploiters and bosses, and conducting indefinite strikes. After the 66,000 workers of the largest automobile monopoly enterprise in France, Renault, took over the company's factories, the 65,000 employees of the Citroen Automobile Company, the 25,000 workers of the Peugeot Automobile Company, and the workers of the Simca Automobile Company successively took over their respective factories. Two thousand two hundred striking workers took over the Michelin tire factory in Clermont-Ferrand in central France. Forty-five thousand miners took over all the mines in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. The Potash mines in Alsace and the mines in the Saône-et-Loire and Provence regions were also taken over by the miners. Workers in factories and mines are organizing themselves to prepare for long-term occupations.

The strike wave has also hit France's port industry. The strikes by dock workers have paralyzed several major ports in France, including Marseille, Dunkirk, Le Havre, Bordeaux, and Setta. Dock workers and sailors have taken over French ships docked in the ports and hoisted bright red flags on the masts. Several thousand striking workers have also taken over the shipyards in La Seyne and La Ciotat near Marseille.

The strike wave has also hit France's nuclear industry. Workers at the famous Pierre Latte gas diffusion plant and Marcoule plant, which produce materials for France's atomic and hydrogen bombs, also went on strike on May 21. Employees at the Cadarache and Grenoble nuclear research centers are in intense discussions about "completely reorganizing" the French Atomic Energy Commission and other issues, preparing to present their demands to the government.

In this struggle of the French workers, workers and students support each other and fight side by side. Workers support students in their struggle against the rotten educational system and police brutality, and students support workers in their political and economic strikes. Currently, students have occupied 18 universities in France for a week. Many university buildings are flying bright red flags. Students have hung portraits of Marx, Lenin, and Chairman Mao in the Paris University campus. Students are engaged in heated debates on issues related to education and society. The "High School Action Committee" of France has called on all middle school students to occupy their schools. University, middle school, and primary school teachers in France have decided to go on strike. Most schools in France have suspended classes.

Currently, the French capital, Paris, is in a state of semi-paralysis. Trains are not running, planes are not flying, and subway and bus services have stopped. The postal headquarters, power plants, power distribution centers, water supply stations, and health departments have been taken over by workers.

On May 20, the French government sent police to disperse the striking workers' picket lines and forcibly took over the postal headquarters. Postal workers protested against the police intervention. Paris power workers said that if the police suppress the strike, they will cut off the power supply. The French Air Force took over France's airports and civil aviation on May 21, but domestic and international air traffic remains interrupted. Due to the suspension of subway and bus services, traffic in Paris is congested and chaotic. Although the Paris authorities dispatched several hundred military police trucks to transport passengers, it was like a drop in the bucket and had no effect.

Under the impact of the strike wave, French stock prices have been continuously falling, with banking, electricity, and construction industry stocks falling the most. Many people are afraid of further stock price drops and are buying gold, causing Paris gold prices to soar. On the morning of May 20, before the banks opened, large crowds of Paris residents lined up outside the doors to withdraw their deposits. Although the banks immediately restricted the amount of withdrawals, under the pressure of the run, many banks ran out of cash within a few hours and had to close immediately. In the afternoon of May 20, bank employees announced a strike, and all banks in France have stopped operating.

In the past two days, Paris residents have been rushing to buy food. Long lines of people with handcarts form outside food stores, butcher shops, bakeries, tobacco shops, and gas stations. Many stores' rice, sugar, coffee, and canned food have been snatched up in an instant. Paris is in a state of panic and chaos.

The surging strike wave has made the French government panic. French President de Gaulle has been holding meetings with Prime Minister Pompidou, Defense Minister Messmer, Interior Minister Fouchet, Transportation Minister Chamant, Industry Minister Giscard d'Estaing, and Post and Telecommunications Minister Guichard for several days. On the morning of May 21, he convened an emergency cabinet meeting at the Élysée Palace to discuss countermeasures. Previously, according to French Information Minister Gorse, de Gaulle threatened at the cabinet meeting on May 19, "Reform can be done, but chaos cannot be tolerated." De Gaulle has studied various measures to maintain "public order" and is openly threatening the French people.

The strike of French workers has shaken the entire continent of Europe. Capitalists in London, Bonn, Rome, and Vienna are anxious. On one hand, they are worried that the fighting actions of Paris workers will inspire workers in Western European countries to rebel. On the other hand, they are afraid that the French franc will depreciate under the impact of the strike wave, causing a chain reaction and leading to a new crisis in the financial and monetary system of the capitalist world.

    奋起造反　猛烈冲击垄断资产阶级反动统治
    法国八百多万工人大罢工
    工人们占领了三百多个重要的工厂、矿山。铁路、空中、海上交通瘫痪。银行、邮局已关闭。全国经济生活一片混乱。法国政府惊慌失措。工人踢开法修绊脚石，同学生并肩战斗。斗争烈火越烧越旺，震撼了整个欧洲
    新华社二十一日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人阶级的政治和经济罢工，如燎原的烈火，越烧越旺，迅速烧遍整个法国。到二十一日，罢工人数已超过八百万，工人占领了三百多个重要的工厂、矿山。法国的铁路、空中、海上的交通已经瘫痪，银行、邮局也已关门。整个法国的经济生活陷于混乱状态。法国工人阶级的斗争猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，震撼了整个欧洲。
    法国这次空前规模的罢工斗争的爆发，是法国国内阶级矛盾激化的结果。在资本主义世界政治、经济危机日益深化，法国生产停滞，垄断资产阶级加紧向工人阶级转嫁危机的情况下，法国工人对他们困苦的生活和腐朽的资本主义制度的不满日益增强。在法国空前高涨的学生运动的推动和激发下，法国工人中蕴藏的巨大愤懑，爆发成为燎原的怒火。
    法国这次工人罢工斗争的发展迅猛异常。据西方通讯社报道，十七日上午参加罢工的工人只有十万人，下午达到五十万，十九日上午超过二百万，二十一日上午已达八百多万人，超过了法国工人和公教人员总数一千五百万人的一半。短短四、五天内，罢工怒潮就席卷了全法国的九十多个省，使法国的交通、运输、邮电和很大一部分的工矿企业陷于瘫痪。
    值得注意的是，这次声势浩大的罢工，是从工矿企业的基层爆发起来的。在学生斗争的推动下，一批法国工厂的工人，为了维护他们的切身利益，不听上级黄色工会的号令，毅然举行罢工。越来越多的工人群起效法，几天之内就形成了全国总罢工的局面。奋起造反的法国工人把法修的以及其他黄色工会的头目撇在一边。
    在这次斗争中，越来越多的法国工人不顾黄色工会头目的反对，突破了过去罢工的清规戒律，以战斗的姿态占领了一大批工厂、矿山和企业，把平日剥削欺压他们的老板和资方人员扣留起来，进行无限期罢工。在法国最大的汽车垄断企业——雷诺汽车公司的六万六千工人占领了这个公司所属的工厂以后，雪铁龙汽车公司的六万五千职工，普吉奥汽车公司二万五千工人和西姆卡汽车公司的工人都先后占领了各自的工厂。两万两千名罢工工人占领了法国中部克莱芒—费朗的米歇兰轮胎工厂。四万五千名矿工占领了诺尔—加莱海峡省的全部矿井。阿尔萨斯的波塔什矿山以及索恩—卢瓦尔省和普罗文斯地区的矿井也被矿工占领。工厂矿山中的工人正在加紧组织起来准备进行长期占领。
    码头工人的罢工使法国的几个大港口——马赛港、敦刻尔克港、勒阿弗尔港、波尔多港和西奥塔港都陷于瘫痪。码头工人和海员占领了停泊在港口的法国船只，在桅樯上升起一面面鲜艳的红旗。几千罢工工人还占领了马赛附近的拉塞恩船坞和拉西奥塔船坞。
    罢工的浪潮还冲击了法国的原子工业。为法国生产原子弹和氢弹原料的著名的皮埃尔拉特气体扩散工厂和马库勒工厂的工人，二十一日也举行罢工。卡达拉希和格勒诺布勒等原子研究中心的职工正在紧张地讨论着“彻底改组”法国原子能委员会等问题，准备向政府提出他们的要求。
    在法国工人这次斗争中，工人与学生彼此支持，并肩战斗。工人们支持学生反对腐朽教育制度和反对警察暴行的斗争，学生们支持工人的政治和经济罢工。目前，大学生占领法国十八个大学已达一周。许多大学建筑物上飘扬着鲜艳的红旗。学生们在巴黎大学校园内挂起马克思、列宁和毛主席像。学生们就教育和社会等问题进行热烈的辩论。法国“中学行动委员会”呼吁全国中学生占领中学。法国大学、中学和小学教师已决定罢教。法国绝大部分的学校已停课。
    目前，法国首都巴黎已陷于半瘫痪状态。火车不走，飞机停飞，地下铁道和公共汽车交通停顿。电讯总局、发电厂、电力分配中心、配水站和市卫生局已被工人占领。
    法国政府二十日派警察冲散罢工工人的警戒线，强行接管电讯总局。电讯总局的职工对警察的干涉表示抗议。巴黎电力工人表示，如果警察对罢工进行镇压，他们就要切断电源。法国空军二十一日接管了法国的机场和民航事业，但国内外空中交通仍然中断。由于地下铁道和公共汽车停驶，巴黎市内交通拥挤，混乱不堪。巴黎当局尽管派了几百辆军警用的卡车运载乘客，但也如杯水车薪，无济于事。
    在罢工浪潮的冲击下，法国股票价格不断下跌，银行、电力、建筑业股票跌得最凶。不少人害怕股票继续跌价，转购黄金，巴黎金价因而猛涨。二十日清晨，银行还未开门，就有大批巴黎市民在门前排着长队等着提取存款。虽然银行马上限制提款数目，但在挤兑之下，几小时之内不少银行的现款就被取光，不得不马上关门。二十日下午，银行职工宣布罢工，全法国的银行已停止营业。
    这两天，巴黎居民纷纷抢购食品。在食品店、肉铺、面包房、烟草店和汽车加油站前，人们推着手推车，排起很长的队伍。许多商店的大米、食糖、咖啡和罐头食品转眼之间就被抢购一空。巴黎市内人心惶惶，一片混乱。
    日益高涨的罢工怒潮使法国政府惊慌失措。法国总统戴高乐连日来一再同总理蓬皮杜、武装部队部长梅斯梅尔、内政部长伏歇、交通部长夏芒、工业部长吉夏尔、邮电部长盖纳等官员磋商后，二十一日上午在爱丽舍宫再次召集内阁紧急会议，会商对策。在这之前，据法国宣传部长戈尔斯透露，戴高乐在十九日的内阁会议上要挟说，“改革可以，乱来不行”。戴高乐已研究了维持“公共秩序的各种措施”，露骨地对法国人民进行威胁。
    法国工人的罢工斗争震动了整个欧洲。伦敦、波恩、罗马、维也纳的资本家忐忑不安。他们一方面担心，巴黎工人的战斗行动会鼓舞西欧各国工人起来造反。另一方面，他们害怕法国法郎在罢工浪潮冲击下出现贬值，将会引起连锁反应，造成资本主义世界金融货币的新危机。
