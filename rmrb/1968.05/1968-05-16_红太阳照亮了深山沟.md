In the Dabie Mountains of Anhui, Engineer Corps soldier Zhang Ao Hong, who is carrying out the task of supporting the left, said: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the source of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has developed to an unprecedented extent, which is the greatest achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He also told a story—

The Red Sun Illuminates the Deep Valley

Last year, I was supporting the left in the Dabie Mountains of Anhui. Here, mountains stretch into the distance, and forests follow one after another. From the district to the commune, it is more than eighty li, and you have to cross more than fifty mountains. The entire commune has more than 1,300 households, scattered in hundreds of valleys. Due to the efforts of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to block information, the entire commune previously had only two books of Chairman Mao's works.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sounded a spring thunder, and the radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the mountain area. From then on, the ever-shining red sun rose in the deep valley. Now, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, every family hangs Chairman Mao's portrait, and every village sets up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of the mountain people.

In a dense bamboo forest on a big hillside, lives the family of poor peasant Guo Grandma. Two years ago, her family hall still had the tablets of "Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Parents, and Teacher." The surging tide of the Cultural Revolution washed away all the filth, and the whole family worked together to smash these old tablets to pieces. The daughter-in-law bought more than thirty portraits of Chairman Mao from dozens of li away and arranged three "red sun" picture frames in the hall, so that the whole family could see Chairman Mao's great image every day. The whole family studies Chairman Mao's works, uses Mao Zedong Thought to wipe away the dust from their minds, to guide the family's activities, and to direct every day's work.

Guo Grandma is illiterate and her eyes are weak, but she is very active in studying Mao Zedong Thought. She asks her eight-year-old grandson to be her teacher, teaching her one character at a time and recognizing one character at a time. In this way, she memorized the "Three Articles" and remembered many quotations from Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought liberated her from the small world of the family. In the past, she only cared about firewood, rice, oil, salt, children, and husband; now, she thinks of the collective, the country, and the revolution with all her heart.

Guo Grandma's private plot is adjacent to the production team's sesame field. Guo Grandpa had selfish thoughts, and one noon, he casually plowed a ridge from the production team's field into his private plot and planted a row of tobacco leaves. This incident happened to be seen by Guo Grandma, who was so angry that she argued with her husband. Guo Grandpa was not convinced, picked up his hoe, and went to work.

In the evening, the three generations of the family sat together in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and the family study class began. First, they studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working in the interests of the people." Then, Guo Grandma recounted her husband's plowing incident in detail and criticized, "A ridge of land may be small, but there is a distinction between public and private! Taking care of oneself and harming the collective does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings." The elder son said, "'Private' is a troublemaker. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use the 'private' in our minds to promote 'three independences and one contract,' leading us back to the old path of the old society. We must not be fooled!" The little grandson also said, "The PLA uncles often say that there are still many poor people suffering in the world. We must not forget them!"

Chairman Mao's great teachings and the sincere criticisms of his family members touched Guo Grandpa's heart and reminded him of many bitter experiences: generation after generation of hard work and begging, suffering endless exploitation. One year of drought, no harvest, the landlord drove them to pay rent, forcing the whole family to flee and beg. By the end of the year, the snow blocked the mountains, and there was no help from heaven or earth. The whole family could only huddle together in a grass nest and cry. After liberation, Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country to follow the socialist path, and the family finally had a good life. He looked at the new house and pointed to the new furniture, tears of excitement welling up in his eyes, saying, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to follow the socialist path, how could we have today? 'Revisionism' is a disaster, 'private' is the root. If 'private' clouds the mind, it will let the Chinese Khrushchev lead us back to the old path. I will never fall for this trick. I will follow Chairman Mao to the end!"

The next day, as soon as dawn broke, Guo Grandpa went into his private plot, pulled out the row of tobacco leaves, and plowed the ridge back into the production team's field. He carefully planted a row of sesame.

### 红太阳照亮了深山沟

    在安徽大别山区执行支左任务的工程兵战士庄敖洪同志说：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的源泉。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动空前大发展，这是无产阶级文化大革命中最大的成就。他也说了一个故事——
    红太阳照亮了深山沟
    去年，我在安徽大别山全军公社支左。这里高山连着高山，密林接着密林，从区里到公社八十多里路，就得翻五十多个山头。全公社一千三百多户人家，散居在成百个山冲里。由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人极力封锁，过去整个公社只有两本毛主席著作。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声春雷，光芒四射的毛泽东思想普照山区，从此，深山沟升起了永远不落的红太阳。现在，人人都读毛主席的书，家家都挂毛主席的像，村村都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了山区人民的心。
    在一个大山坡的竹林丛中，住着贫农郭大娘一家。两年前，她家堂屋里还设着“天、地、君、亲、师”的牌位。文化大革命的滚滚洪流，荡涤了一切污泥浊水，全家齐动手，将这些旧牌位砸了个稀巴烂。儿媳妇从几十里外买来了三十多张毛主席画像，在堂屋里布置了三个“红太阳”画栏，使全家人天天看到毛主席的伟大形象。全家人都学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来揩掉自己思想上的灰尘，来统帅全家的活动，来指挥每天的工作。
    郭大娘不识字，眼也花了，可是，学习毛泽东思想很积极。她叫八岁的小孙子做她的老师，一字一字地教，一字一字地认。就这样，她背会了“老三篇”，记住了好多条毛主席语录。毛泽东思想把她从家庭的小天地里解放了出来。以前，她关心的只是柴米油盐、儿孙、老伴；如今，她一个心眼想着集体、国家和革命。
    郭大娘家的自留地，紧挨着生产队的芝麻地。郭大爷有私心，一天中午，顺手把生产队的地往自留地耙了一垄过来，种上了一行烟叶。这事正好叫郭大娘见着，气得和老伴争吵起来。郭大爷不服，锄头一扛，上工去了。
    晚上，祖孙三代围坐在毛主席像前，家庭学习班开始学习了。先学了毛主席的教导：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”接着，郭大娘一五一十地把老伴耙地的事端了出来，并且批评说：“一垄地虽小，可有个公私之分哪！光顾自己，损害集体，不符合毛主席的教导。”大儿子说：“‘私’字是害人精，中国赫鲁晓夫就想利用咱们头脑里的‘私’字搞‘三自一包’，把咱们拉回旧社会的老路。咱们可不能上当！”小孙子也说：“解放军叔叔不是常讲，全世界还有好多穷人在受苦吗？咱们可不能忘了他们呀！”
    毛主席的伟大教导，亲人们的诚恳批评，句句打动郭大爷的心，勾起了他一桩桩辛酸的往事：祖祖辈辈帮工要饭，受尽了剥削的苦。有一年大旱，颗粒无收，地主老财逼租，逼得全家逃荒要饭。到了年关，大雪封山，叫天天不应，入地地无门，全家只好聚在草窝里哭成一团。解放了，毛主席领导全国人民走社会主义道路，一家才有了好日子。他看看新房子，点点新家具，激动得热泪盈眶地说：“要不是毛主席领导我们走社会主义道路，哪来的今天？‘修’是祸，‘私’是根，‘私’字迷了心窍，就会叫中国赫鲁晓夫牵着鼻子朝老路上走，我绝不上这个当。我一定跟着毛主席走到底！”
    第二天天刚破晓，郭大爷走进自留地，拔掉了那行烟叶，把一垄地又耙回到生产队的大田里，并且细心地栽上了一行芝麻。
