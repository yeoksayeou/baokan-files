Strengthen Cooperation, Jointly Fight, and Launch Armed Struggle

The Naga, Mizo, and other ethnic armed forces, which are fighting for national liberation, have intensified their attacks on the Indian reactionary military in eastern India and strengthened the links and cooperation among the ethnic armed forces. The Indian reactionaries are in a state of panic.

The Indian bourgeois newspaper *The Hindustan Times* revealed on May 3 that the New Delhi authorities confirmed that the armed forces of the Naga, Mizo, and Kuki have established contact. Not long ago, in the centrally administered territory of Manipur, the Mizo and Kuki armed forces jointly struck the Indian reactionary military.

Another bourgeois newspaper, *The Indian Express*, also revealed on May 8 that the Naga, Mizo, and Kuki forces went to the Mizo Hills to assist the local ethnic armed forces in their armed struggle. Not long ago, about 200 Mizo fighters arrived in the Naga Hills and joined the Naga armed forces that have been fighting there. It was this part of the Naga armed forces that launched fierce attacks on the reactionary military's patrol teams in Ukhrul and Sadar on April 30 and May 1, respectively.

In recent months, the Mizo armed forces have repeatedly struck the Indian reactionary military. According to Reuters, during March and April of this year, the Mizo armed forces killed and wounded more than 40 Indian soldiers. In a single battle on March 20, the Mizo armed forces killed 20 Indian soldiers and wounded 7 in the mountainous forest area near Imphal, the capital of Manipur.

The panicked Indian reactionary government is plotting conspiracies, attempting to suppress the armed struggles of various ethnic groups. It is trying to deceive some leaders of the Naga armed forces into "peace talks," attempting to prolong the "ceasefire" period to paralyze the Naga armed struggle, and to split and buy off its leaders. The Indian reactionaries are also colluding with the reactionary government of Burma, attempting to establish a so-called "security corridor" on the Indo-Burmese border and take joint patrols and other measures to jointly suppress these ethnic armed forces fighting for national liberation. The British bourgeois newspaper *The Times* also revealed the panic of the Indian reactionaries. This newspaper reported from New Delhi on March 24: "The entire eastern border region, including Assam, Manipur, the Naga region, and the Mizo Hills, has now become a hotbed of unrest." The report also revealed that high-ranking officials of the Indian reactionary government hurriedly took planes to Assam and other places to plot reactionary measures to suppress the ethnic armed forces.

    加强合作　共同战斗　大力开展武装斗争
    那加米佐等民族武装加紧打击印度反动派
    新华社十二日讯　新德里消息：正在争取民族解放的那加、米佐等民族武装，在印度东部地区加紧打击印度反动军队，加强民族武装之间的联系和合作。印度反动派对此惊慌失措。
    印度资产阶级报纸《印度斯坦旗报》三日透露，新德里官方证实，那加、米佐和库基族的武装已经建立起联系。不久以前，在中央直属领地曼尼普尔，米佐族和库基族武装联合打击了印度反动军队。
    另一家资产阶级报纸《印度快报》八日也透露，那加、米佐和库基族部队前往米佐山区去协助当地的民族武装开展武装斗争。不久以前，大约二百名米佐族战士到达那加山区，同那里坚持武装斗争的那加族武装会合，正是这部分那加族武装在四月三十日和五月一日分别在乌肯鲁尔和萨达尔山区向反动军队的巡逻队发动了猛烈的进攻。
    最近几个月来，米佐族武装多次有力地打击印度反动军队。据路透社透露，在今年三、四月间，米佐族武装打死打伤印军官兵共四十多人。仅在三月二十日的一次战斗中，米佐族武装在曼尼普尔的首府英普哈尔附近的山林地区就打死印军二十人，打伤七人。
    惶恐不安的印度反动政府正在策划阴谋，妄图把各民族的武装斗争镇压下去。它一面诱骗那加族武装的某些领导人进行“和平谈判”，企图用延长“停火”期限来麻痹那加族的武装斗争，并且分化收买它的领导人。印度反动派还加紧同缅甸反动政府勾结，企图在印缅边境建立所谓“安全走廊”和采取联合巡逻等办法，联合镇压这些为争取民族解放而斗争的民族武装。英国资产阶级报纸《泰晤士报》也透露了印度反动派的惊慌失措。这家报纸在三月二十四日发自新德里的报道中说：“阿萨姆、曼尼普尔、那加地区和米佐山区的整个东部边境地区，现在成为骚乱的温床”。报道还透露，印度反动政府的高级官员赶忙坐飞机到阿萨姆邦等地去策划镇压民族武装的反动措施。
