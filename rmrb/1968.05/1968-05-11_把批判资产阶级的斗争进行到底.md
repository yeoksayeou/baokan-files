Chairman Mao, in his "May 7 Directive," pointed out that whether it is soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, peasants, students, or employees of commercial, service industries, and party and government organs, all must criticize the bourgeoisie.

The great struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie has major and minor battles, with major and minor battles alternating. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a major battle, "it is the continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Our great struggle and criticism of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party is a major struggle against the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the turbulent waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of the people, following the luminous course indicated by Chairman Mao's "May 7 Directive," have pointed out the situation, written passionately, and raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, achieving one victory after another.

At present, we have achieved great victories in the great struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie. However, we must see that thoroughly purging the poison spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party over a long period in various fields is still a very arduous task. We must not relax because of victory. "Any thought of relaxing the fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong." We must press on with our victories and never relax our revolutionary criticism, launching more fierce attacks on the class enemies.

Revolutionary criticism must start from the major issues of the struggle between the two lines, aiming our guns at the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, at their agents in various regions, systems, and units, at the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries under their protection, and at all class enemies who have infiltrated our ranks. We must link China's Khrushchev's revisionist line with the counter-revolutionary crimes of his accomplices, henchmen, and lackeys, and criticize them severely. In this way, we grasp the main contradiction with the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, making three distinctions: distinguishing between enemy contradictions and people's internal contradictions, distinguishing between the broad masses and the few bad elements among them, and distinguishing between the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction. By correctly grasping the party's policies and strategies, we can unite the overwhelming majority of people and push the movement from victory to victory. *Jiefang Daily* editorial, May 7.

### 把批判资产阶级的斗争进行到底

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    把批判资产阶级的斗争进行到底
    毛主席在“五·七”指示中指出，无论是解放军指战员、工人、农民、学生，还是商业、服务行业、党政机关工作人员，都要批判资产阶级。
    批判资产阶级的伟大斗争，有大战役、小战役，大战役和小战役交替进行。这次无产阶级文化大革命，就是一次大战役，“是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的大批判、大斗争，就是同国民党反动派代理人的大搏斗。在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中，广大人民沿着毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉航道，指点江山，激扬文字，高举革命大批判的旗帜，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    目前，我们在批判资产阶级的伟大斗争中已经取得了巨大胜利，但是必须看到，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资派长期以来在各个领域里散布的毒素，还是一个十分艰巨的任务。绝不能因为胜利，就松懈起来，
  “任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”我们必须乘胜前进，一刻也不放松革命的大批判，向阶级敌人展开更猛烈的进攻。
    革命的大批判，一定要从两条路线斗争的大是大非出发，把炮口对准党内最大的一小撮走资派，对准他们在各地区、各系统、各单位的代理人，对准他们庇护下的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，对准混进我们队伍里的一切阶级敌人，把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线同他的帮凶、爪牙、娄罗们的反革命罪行联系起来，狠狠地进行批判。这样，我们就抓住了同党内一小撮走资派这个主要矛盾，做到了三个区别：区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾、区别广大群众和混入其中的极少数坏人、区别主要矛盾和次要矛盾，正确地掌握了党的政策和策略，就能团结绝大多数人，把运动从胜利推向胜利。《解放日报》五月七日社论
