According to a report from the Tianjin Daily, Chairman Mao recently pointed out once again: "We should believe that more than 90 percent of the cadres are good and relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be reformed." The revolutionary cadres of Xinzhuang Production Brigade in Hancheng District, Tianjin City, have taken up the responsibility of leading the revolution and production. They have been earnestly fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, strengthening their ideological revolutionization, actively participating in collective production labor, closely linking with the masses, and leading the broad masses of community members to seize the revolution and promote spring plowing, achieving remarkable results.

Cadres and masses together fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, transforming their worldview

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Running study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The cadres of this brigade, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, the leading cadres of the brigade, as ordinary students, together with the masses, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, transforming their worldview. At first, some cadres were worried that exposing their selfishness in public would lose their authority. But after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything," they realized that not daring to expose their selfishness in front of the masses is a big issue of whether to believe in the masses or not, and whether to have the determination to place oneself under the supervision of the masses, thoroughly correcting one's shortcomings and mistakes. After raising their awareness, the brigade cadres actively went to various study classes, exposing their selfishness alongside the masses. They did not fear exposing their ugliness or fighting against their selfishness in front of the masses, using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to fiercely criticize the poison of revisionism. This way, the cadres and the masses became even closer, their relationship more intimate. They themselves deeply felt: "Exposing selfishness in front of the masses, what you lose is only shortcomings and mistakes, what you gain is the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, gaining the help and trust of the masses. Only by placing oneself under the supervision of the masses can one avoid or reduce mistakes."

Cadres actively participate in collective production labor as ordinary community members

The leading cadres of this brigade have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "cadres participating in collective production labor, maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people." They have always insisted on participating in collective production labor. The brigade arranges work during leisure time. In labor, wherever it is hard and tiring, the cadres go there. For example, going more than ten miles away to repair a dry ditch, the work is tiring, and the main leading cadres of the brigade, such as Cui Yunqiao and Chen Yuting, all took the lead to go there to work.

The cadres of this brigade, especially the main leading cadres, through participating in collective production labor, deeply felt that insisting on participating in collective labor is an important link in maintaining close relations between cadres and the masses, an important channel for discovering and solving problems; most importantly, it can use labor rest time to study Chairman Mao's works with the community members, achieving the guidance of production by Mao Zedong Thought. For example, at the beginning of spring plowing production, some community members advocated for "small contract work," saying that implementing "small contract work" could stimulate enthusiasm. The leading cadres of the brigade, through participating in collective production labor, timely discovered this active thought and immediately organized the masses to carry out a revolutionary criticism and struggle. The broad masses of community members, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fiercely criticized the revisionist fallacies of "work points in command" and "material incentives" advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, making the community members realize that implementing "small contract work" emphasizes "work points in command," stimulates the enthusiasm of "selfishness," which will affect the quality of farm work, corrupt people's thoughts, destroy the mutual aid relationship among community members, and walk the capitalist road. Only by emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought and establishing the idea of farming for the revolution can the enthusiasm for the public be fully brought into play.

Cadres consult with the masses on matters, willing to be the students of the masses

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given the cadres of this brigade a very profound education. They deeply realized that being a cadre is whether to place oneself in the position of an "official" or a "servant"; whether to be subjective and arbitrary or to fully carry out democracy, this is the fundamental issue of whether one can maintain close ties with the masses. Therefore, they have always paid attention to learning Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. Among the cadres of the brigade, in addition to establishing the system of criticism and self-criticism, they also timely help and correct those who cannot correctly treat the masses' criticism. For an important task, in addition to the collective discussion among the brigade cadres, they also mobilize the community members to fully discuss and widely listen to the opinions of the masses. Some cadres initially had such active thoughts: "I am also a farmer, which field to plant and which field to harvest are all in my mind, there is no need to discuss much." However, through learning Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses' production, the masses' interests, the masses' experience, the masses' emotions, these are all what the leading cadres should pay attention to at all times," they criticized their wrong thoughts. This year's sowing plan, they handed it over to the community members for full discussion, collecting ideas, finding ways, and taking measures, turning more than 200 mu of saline-alkali land into irrigated land, creating favorable conditions for achieving a bumper harvest this year in agriculture.

    革命干部全心全意挑起重担
    带领社员狠抓革命猛促生产
    辛庄大队干部和广大群众红心相连并肩战斗
    据天津日报报道：毛主席最近又一次指出：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”天津市汉沽区辛庄大队的革命干部，挑起领导革命和生产的重担后，认真斗私批修，加强思想革命化，积极参加集体生产劳动，密切联系群众，带领广大社员群众抓革命促春耕，取得显著成绩。
    干部和群众一起斗私批修，改造世界观
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”这个大队的革命干部遵照毛主席教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，大队领导干部以普通学员身份和群众一起斗私批修，改造世界观。起初，有的干部担心在大庭广众面前亮私斗私，会失掉威信。但当他们反复学习了毛主席“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了”的教导后，认识到，有私不敢在群众面前斗，是相信不相信群众的大问题，是有没有决心把自己放在群众的监督之下，彻底改正缺点、错误的大问题。认识提高之后，大队干部都主动地下到各片学习班里，跟群众一起亮私、斗私。他们在群众面前，亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼，用毛泽东思想这个强大武器，狠批修正主义流毒。这样一来，干部和群众之间心贴得更紧了，关系更密切了。他们自己深有体会地说：“在群众面前亮私、斗私，丢掉的只是缺点、错误，得到的却是光焰无际的毛泽东思想，取得了群众的帮助和信任。只有把自己放在群众监督之下，才能不犯或少犯错误。”
  干部以普通社员姿态积极参加集体生产劳动
    这个大队的领导干部，牢记毛主席关于“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系”的教导，一直坚持参加集体生产劳动。大队安排工作，都是利用业余时间。在劳动中，哪里艰苦、劳累，干部们就到哪里去。如到离村十几里以外去修干渠，活较累，大队的主要领导干部崔云樵、陈玉亭等都带头到那里去劳动。
    这个大队的干部，特别是主要领导干部，通过参加集体生产劳动，深有体会地说，坚持参加集体劳动，是密切干群关系的重要一环，是发现问题，解决问题的重要途径；最重要的是，能利用劳动休息时间，和社员一起活学活用毛主席著作，做到用毛泽东思想统帅生产。如春耕生产刚开始的时候，有的社员主张挑渠沟实行“小包工”的办法，说什么实行“小包工”，能调动积极性。大队领导干部通过参加集体生产劳动，及时发现这一活思想，马上组织群众开展革命大批判。广大社员群众以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人竭力鼓吹的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义谬论，使社员群众认识到，实行“小包工”，突出的是“工分挂帅”，调动的是“私”字的积极性，结果会影响农活质量，腐蚀人的思想，破坏社员之间团结互助关系，走的是资本主义道路。只有突出毛泽东思想，树立为革命种田的思想，为公的积极性才能充分发挥出来。
    干部遇事和群众商量，甘当群众的小学生
    无产阶级文化大革命，使这个大队的干部受到了极为深刻的教育。他们深刻地认识到，当干部，是把自己摆在
  “官”的地位，还是摆在“勤务员”的地位；是主观武断，还是充分发扬民主，这是能不能密切联系群众的根本问题。因此，他们一直注意学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导。大队干部之间除建立了批评和自我批评的制度外，平日发现有的干部不能正确地对待群众的批评意见，就及时进行帮助改正。对某一项重要任务，除大队干部集体讨论外，还要发动社员进行充分讨论，广泛听取群众的意见。有的干部开始还有这样的活思想：“我也是庄稼把式，那块地该种，那块地该收，都在我肚里装着，用不着多商量。”但是，他们通过学习毛主席关于“群众生产，群众利益，群众经验，群众情绪，这些都是领导干部们应时刻注意的”的教导，批判了自己的错误思想。今年的播种计划，他们交给社员充分进行讨论，群策群力，想办法，提措施，把二百多亩盐碱地改造成水浇地，为夺取今年农业大丰收创造了有利条件。
