The workers of the capital, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticize the "expert line" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and achieve tremendous results in mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, May 6 -- During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of the capital, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, carried out mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities, achieving abundant results. At present, in factories and enterprises, new designs, new processes, new products, new equipment, and new tools are abundant and emerging continuously.

	During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities on the industrial front in Beijing have shown several prominent features. The first feature is: to take Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, highlight proletarian politics, and serve proletarian politics.

	Broad masses of revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, carried out revolutionary criticism, criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought, purged the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "technical leadership," "material incentives," and "profit first," and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions on highlighting proletarian politics, making technological innovation and technological revolution serve proletarian politics. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, which specializes in the production of printing machinery, criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in obstructing the printing and publication of Chairman Mao's works and altering the factory's product direction, took the factory's destiny into their own hands, pooled their wisdom, and successfully trial-produced a single-sided printing machine for printing revolutionary treasures, which was put into mass production and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers in the printing industry who print Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Beijing Medical Instrument Industry fiercely criticized the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, which served the health work for the cities' minority, and fiercely criticized the bourgeois direction in the production of medical instruments under this reactionary line, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," successfully trial-produced a batch of medical instruments suitable for rural mobile medical services, and put them into production. Many factory workers resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," carried out technological innovation, strived to complete the production tasks of national defense and military supplies, increased the production of products related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and innovated technology to produce aid-to-foreign products, supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

	The second feature of the technological innovation and technological revolution activities on the industrial front in Beijing is: criticizing the "expert line" of the Chinese Khrushchev and implementing Chairman Mao's mass line.

	The broad masses of revolutionary workers in Beijing, in carrying out mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, carried out mass movements, with everyone contributing their ideas and efforts, uniting and cooperating, pooling their wisdom, making technological innovation and technological revolution activities flourish. The solution to the "cylinder pulling" problem of the air compressor in the Beijing First General Machinery Factory is a typical example of implementing the mass line in technological innovation. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in the past relied on bourgeois "experts" to suppress the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, making the quality problem of the air compressor's "cylinder pulling" unsolvable for a long time. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the factory studied Chairman Mao's teachings that "the masses have limitless creative power. They can organize themselves, advance to every place and department where they can exert their strength, and advance to the depth and breadth of production," and selected six people to form an "experimental group" to be responsible for solving the "cylinder pulling" quality problem. The "experimental group" used the principles taught by Chairman Mao in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to conduct experimental research, discovered the errors of the bourgeois "authority" in the design, and finally took effective measures to cure the old problem of the air compressor's "cylinder pulling." Subsequently, the revolutionary workers comprehensively innovated the design of the air compressor's clutch, simplifying the original ninety-one parts into sixteen parts, and using new materials for production. In this way, the installation, adjustment, and repair of the clutch are very convenient, and the quality of the air compressor has been greatly improved.

	In the technological innovation activities, the broad masses of revolutionary workers in Beijing adopted many good methods of implementing the mass line, such as the combination of workers, technical personnel, and revolutionary leading cadres, the combination of factories, scientific research units, and schools, and inter-factory cooperation, achieving remarkable results. The crystal transistor digital computer of the Beijing Wire and Cable Factory, the portable X-ray diagnostic machine of the Beijing Dongfanghong Medical Instrument Factory, the new automatic coking machine of the Beijing Chemical Experiment Factory, and the new process of cutting liquefied petroleum gas of the Beijing Metal Structure Factory are all products of the "three combinations" within and outside the factory or inter-factory cooperation.

	The third feature of the technological innovation and technological revolution activities on the industrial front in Beijing is: the great spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle is fully displayed.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the basis of our policy? It is based on our own strength, which is called self-reliance." The broad masses of revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, criticized the "slavishness," "crawling," and "abolitionism" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific research departments, placed technological innovation on the basis of their own strength, and strove for self-reliance and hard struggle. After the Beijing Paper Mill accepted the task of trial-producing special thin letterpress paper for Chairman Mao's works, two opinions emerged. One was to follow the old path and use imported titanium dioxide as a filler; the other was to follow their own path and use domestic raw materials without imported titanium dioxide. Revolutionary workers studied Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, broke away from the old framework of using imported titanium dioxide, proposed eight trial production plans, and successfully produced high-quality thin letterpress paper using domestic raw materials. In addition, the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory created a new type of hydrolysis production process using sawdust to produce yeast, surpassing the imperialist countries and countries ruled by revisionists in the research of sawdust hydrolysis; the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced a hydraulic coupling, breaking the technological blockade of imperialist countries and countries ruled by revisionists.

	These technological innovation achievements were all made under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thought of self-reliance.

	The "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." At present, while the working class of the capital is firmly grasping class struggle, it is also continuing to apply the revolutionary spirit and boundless enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production struggles and scientific experiments. The mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities on the industrial front are developing on a larger scale and will surely achieve even greater successes.

　　革命大批判推动群众性技术革新活动
    首都工人以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“专家路线”，群众性的技术革新和技术革命活动取得巨大成果
    新华社五日讯　首都工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，按照毛主席指引的方向，开展群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动，取得了丰硕的成果。目前，在工厂企业里，新设计、新工艺、新产品、新设备、新工具，琳琅满目，层出不穷。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，北京工业战线群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动显示了几个突出的特点。第一个特点是：用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，为无产阶级政治服务。
    广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命大批判，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团猖狂反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，荡涤了“技术挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“利润第一”等反革命修正主义路线的流毒，坚决贯彻毛主席关于突出无产阶级政治的伟大指示，使技术革新、技术革命走上了为无产阶级政治服务的正轨。专门生产印刷机械的北京人民机器厂的革命职工，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团阻挠毛主席著作的印刷出版、篡改工厂产品方向的罪行，把工厂的命运掌握在自己手里，群策群力，试制成功印刷革命宝书的单面印刷机，成批投入生产，受到印刷毛主席著作的广大印刷业职工的热烈欢迎。北京医疗器械工业的广大革命职工，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的卫生工作为城市少数人服务的修正主义路线，狠批了在这条反动路线控制下医疗器械生产中的资产阶级方向，遵循毛主席的“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，试制成功一批适合于农村巡回医疗用的医疗器械，并投入生产。许多工厂的革命职工坚决贯彻毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，大搞技术革新，努力完成国防军需产品的生产任务，增产与国计民生关系较大的产品，还革新技术，搞好援外产品的生产，支援世界革命人民的革命斗争。
    北京工业战线技术革新、技术革命活动的第二个特点是：批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家路线”，贯彻执行了毛主席提出的群众路线。
    北京市广大革命职工在开展群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动中，认真学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导，大搞群众运动，人人动脑，个个动手，团结协作，群策群力，使技术革新、技术革命搞得轰轰烈烈。北京第一通用机械厂解决空气压缩机“拉缸”的毛病，就是在技术革新中贯彻群众路线的一个典型事例。这个厂的党内一小撮走资派过去依靠资产阶级“专家”压制群众的积极性和创造性，使空气压缩机“拉缸”的质量问题长期不得解决。在无产阶级文化大革命中，工厂的革命职工学习了毛主席“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军”的教导，推选六个人组织“试验小组”，负责解决“拉缸”质量问题。“试验小组”运用毛主席在《实践论》和《矛盾论》中所教导的原理，进行试验研究，发现了资产阶级“权威”在设计上的错误，终于采取有效措施，治好了空气压缩机“拉缸”的老毛病。接着，革命职工又全面革新空气压缩机离合器的设计，把原有的九十一个零件简化为十六个零件，并采用新的材料来制造。这样，离合器的安装、调整、修理都很简便，空气压缩机的质量大大提高了一步。
    北京市广大革命职工在技术革新活动中，采取了工人、技术人员、革命领导干部“三结合”，工厂、科学研究单位、学校“三结合”，以及厂际协作等许多走群众路线的好方法，取得了显著的效果。北京有线电厂的晶体管数字计算机、北京东方红医疗器械厂的携带式X线诊断机、北京化工实验厂的新型自动加焦机，北京市金属结构厂的液化石油气切割的新工艺等，都是厂内外“三结合”或厂际协作的产物。
    北京工业战线技术革新、技术革命活动的第三个特点是：自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神大发扬。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”广大革命职工遵照毛主席的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫和在科学研究部门的代理人所推行的“奴隶主义”、“爬行主义”、“取消主义”，把技术革新放在自己力量的基点上，自力更生，艰苦奋斗。北京造纸总厂在接受毛主席著作专用薄凸版纸的试制任务后，出现了两种意见，一种意见是走别人走过的老路，使用进口的钛白粉做填料；另一种意见是走自己的路，采用国产原材料，不用进口的钛白粉。革命职工学习了毛主席关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导，摆脱了使用进口钛白粉的旧框框，提出了八个试制方案，结果，用国产原料试制成功优质薄凸版纸。此外，北京光华木材厂创造一种用木屑制造酵母的新型水解生产工艺，在木屑水解研究方面把帝国主义国家和修正主义者统治的国家抛在后面；北京第三通用机械厂试制成功液力联轴器，使帝国主义国家、修正主义者统治的国家的技术封锁破产。
    这些技术革新成就，都是在毛主席的自力更生的伟大思想指导下取得的。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”目前，首都工人阶级在狠抓阶级斗争的同时，正继续把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命精神和冲天干劲，运用于生产斗争和科学实验。工业战线上的群众性技术革新、技术革命活动，正以更大规模在蓬勃发展，它必将取得更为伟大的成就。
