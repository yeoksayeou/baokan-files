Twenty-six years ago, in his brilliant work *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Our literature and art should above all serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be for their use." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles, such as Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han, openly defied Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In 1962, they blatantly proposed the slogan of "all-people's arts," advocating that literature and art should serve "all the people," including the bourgeoisie, and should "satisfy" the "needs" of "all the people."

	In a society where classes exist, does there really exist such a super-class "all-people's arts" that can serve both the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the bourgeoisie? No! There absolutely is not! Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are a definite part of politics. Art for art's sake, super-class art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics, do not exist in fact."

	In a society where classes exist, does there really exist such a unified "all-people's arts" that can satisfy the needs of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses? No, there absolutely is not! The political "needs" of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are diametrically opposed and fundamentally contradictory. In the realm of politics and ideology, it is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; it is either the proletariat prevailing over the bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie prevailing over the proletariat, with no middle road to take. As an important tool of class struggle, literature and art either adapt to the needs of the proletariat to help the proletariat prevail over the bourgeoisie, or adapt to the needs of the bourgeoisie to help the bourgeoisie prevail over the proletariat. The fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han that literature and art can "satisfy" the "needs" of different classes is merely a deceptive trick used by these representatives of the bourgeoisie in their political struggles!

	In fact, what the Chinese Khrushchev and his black henchmen Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han have done in the literary and artistic circles over the past more than ten years since liberation is to use the leadership they have usurped to oppose Chairman Mao's great direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers under the pretext of serving "all the people," and to try every means to prevail over the proletariat.

	They openly opposed the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers taking up literature and art themselves, barking about how "old women singing is not listened to" and cursing about how "native writers are no good"—is this serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and satisfying the "needs" of "all the people" with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body?

	They openly opposed literature and art depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed creating lofty images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and shouted about how "all red faces, people don't want to watch"—is this also serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and satisfying the "needs" of "all the people" with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body?

	What they "satisfy" is the "needs" of the bourgeoisie! The "needs" of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists! The "needs" of the remnants of the Kuomintang!

	It is under the banner of the Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's arts" that the wives or mothers of capitalists have actually "taken to the stage," and the Chinese Khrushchev even clapped and cheered for them, saying that they have "high socialist enthusiasm" and that it is "good"...

	It is under the banner of the Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's arts" that from the capitalists of the 1930s like Lao Lin (in *The Lin Family Shop*), to the capitalists of the 1950s like Zhang Bo-han (in *The City That Never Sleeps*) ... one after another they have all come out, attempting to seize the literary and artistic front and the political stage for the feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie.

	It is under the banner of the Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's arts" that even those who do not understand literature and art at all, like the "brothers" of the "San Jia Village" counter-revolutionary clique, have eagerly "broken through the door," throwing out that medieval ghost—Hai Rui, who embodies the vain dream of the right-opportunists to stage a comeback and restore capitalism, and shouting loudly that they want to "start a big fight" with the proletariat in this season of "drums in winter and grass in spring" ...

	The "all-people's arts" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his black henchmen Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han is thoroughly counter-revolutionary literature and art! Their so-called "serving 'all the people'" is serving the bourgeoisie, serving to subvert the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

	As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those in party, government, army, and various cultural circles who are in fact representatives of the bourgeoisie and are revisionists, a bunch of counter-revolutionaries, will, when the time is ripe, seize power and turn the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship." The so-called "all-people's arts" is to create public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders to carry out counter-revolutionary seizures of power. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's arts," and advance courageously along the great direction indicated by Chairman Mao for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的“全民文艺”
    洪军
    二十六年前，伟大领袖毛主席在他光辉的著作——《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，明确地指出：我们的文艺，“首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、林默涵之流，竟然明目张胆地对抗毛主席所提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向。他们在一九六二年公然提出“全民文艺”的口号，叫嚷文艺要为“包括”资产阶级分子在内的“以工农兵为主体的全体人民”服务，文艺应当“满足”“全体人民”的“需要”。
    在存在着阶级的社会中，难道果真存在这种既能为工农兵服务，又能为资产阶级服务的超阶级的“全民文艺”吗？没有！根本没有！毛主席早就指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    在存在着阶级的社会中，难道果真存在这种既能满足资产阶级的需要，又能满足无产阶级和广大革命人民群众需要的统一的“全民文艺”吗？没有，根本没有！无产阶级和资产阶级的政治“需要”，是截然不同的，是根本对立的。在政治思想领域中，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风；不是无产阶级压倒资产阶级，就是资产阶级压倒无产阶级，没有中间道路可走。作为阶级斗争的重要工具之一的文学艺术，不是适应无产阶级的需要，帮助无产阶级去压倒资产阶级；就是适应资产阶级的需要，帮助资产阶级去压倒无产阶级。中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙周扬、林默涵之流所编造的文艺“满足”不同阶级“需要”的谬论，只不过是这些资产阶级代表人物用来进行政治斗争的骗人鬼话而已！
    事实上，中国赫鲁晓夫及其黑爪牙周扬、林默涵之流解放十几年来在文艺界所干的，正是利用他们所窃取的领导权，打着“为‘全体人民’服务”的幌子，千方百计地对抗毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的伟大方向，千方百计地企图压倒无产阶级。
    他们公开反对广大的工农兵群众自己起来掌握文艺，狂吠什么“老太婆唱歌没人听”，大骂什么“土作家不行”——这难道是在为工农兵服务，满足“以工农兵为主体的全体人民”的需要吗？
    他们公开反对文艺表现工农兵，反对塑造工农兵高大的英雄形象，叫嚷什么“尽是红脸，人家就不爱看”——这难道也是在为工农兵服务，满足“以工农兵为主体的全体人民”的需要吗？
    他们所“满足”的，是资产阶级的“需要”！是地富反坏右的“需要”！是国民党的残渣余孽的“需要”！
    正是在中国赫鲁晓夫这面“全民文艺”的破旗下，“资本家的老婆或母亲”竟然“登台演戏”，中国赫鲁晓夫甚至为之拍手叫好，胡说什么她们“社会主义热情很高”，“很好”……
    正是在中国赫鲁晓夫“全民文艺”的破旗下，从三十年代的林老板、（《林家铺子》），直到五十年代的资本家张伯韩（《不夜城》）……一个一个全都跳了出来，企图为封建地主、资产阶级争夺文艺阵地，争夺政治舞台。
    正是在中国赫鲁晓夫“全民文艺”的破旗下，连那根本不懂文艺的“三家村”反革命集团的“兄弟”们，也都迫不及待地“破门而出”，抛出那个寄托着右倾机会主义者妄图东山再起，复辟资本主义迷梦的中世纪幽灵——海瑞，并且大叫大嚷，要在这“腊鼓鸣、春草生”的季节，和无产阶级“开始大干”……
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其黑爪牙周扬、林默涵之流所推行的“全民文艺”，就是地地道道的反革命文艺！他们的所谓“为‘全体人民’服务”，就是为资产阶级服务，就是为颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义服务。
    正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”所谓“全民文艺”，就是为中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮最大的走资派进行反革命夺权制造舆论的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫“全民文艺”的反革命黑货，沿着毛主席所指引的文艺为工农兵服务的伟大方向奋勇前进！
