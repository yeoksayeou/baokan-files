	Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, Seriously Study the PLA
	Workers of Jingxing Coal Mine Produce More Coal for the Revolution
	The Entire Mine Area Has Continuously Exceeded the State's Original Coal Production and Excavation Plans for Sixteen Months

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, May 9th: The revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Mining Bureau in Hebei Province, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel stationed in the mine, have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, taken class struggle as the key link, vigorously carried out the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. The revolution is booming, and production is rising month by month. From January last year to April this year, the entire mine area has continuously exceeded the state's original coal production plan and excavation plan for sixteen months.

	Jingxing Coal Mine is an old mine that has been operating for over sixty years. The production equipment is outdated, and the underground geological conditions are complex. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders in the mine, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, advocated the theory of "extinguishing class struggle" within the mine, promoting a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines such as production first, technology first, and material incentives. When production problems arose, they always blamed the poor machinery and equipment, and the complex underground geological conditions, resulting in unstable production. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they organized all revolutionary workers in the mine to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, focusing on class struggle, and launching a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the revolutionary committee of this mine responded promptly, organizing all revolutionary workers in the mine, from the mining bureau, mine, workshop, coal mining team, work team to the workers' families, to set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The entire mine area is filled with classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and battlefields for revolutionary criticism.

	After the revolutionary criticism, the proletarian consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers in the mine area have greatly improved, and the awareness of class struggle has been significantly strengthened. They use revolution to lead production, launching a fierce and proactive attack on the class enemy. At one time, Mine 1's Coal Mining Team 2 would encounter mechanical and electrical accidents at the critical moment of maximum coal output, affecting coal output, and sometimes even failing to transport a single ton of coal in a shift. Some people thought that the underground passages were narrow, the roof pressure was high, and mechanical and electrical accidents were inevitable. Others thought that the underground transportation equipment was outdated and difficult to maintain. With the help of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the mine, the workers of Coal Mining Team 2, with this problem in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on using the perspective of class and class struggle to view and analyze everything. They heightened their awareness of class struggle and sharpened their eyes. After everyone's exposure and investigation, it turned out that a "mechanical and electrical worker" in the coal mining team was a historical counter-revolutionary hidden within the ranks of the workers for a long time. After exposing this historical counter-revolutionary, the coal mining team has not had a single major mechanical and electrical accident lasting more than half an hour in several months, and the output of raw coal has been steadily increasing.

	All revolutionary workers and old and new cadres in the mine also follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, which is a very good method" and extensively carry out heart-to-heart talks. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to seriously fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, promoting their own ideological revolutionization. Some underground workers in Mine 3 did not strictly observe labor discipline. After extensively carrying out heart-to-heart talks and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the old workers also exposed the bitter lives of miners during the rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, greatly raising the class consciousness of the workers. Everyone strives to achieve full attendance and improve the utilization rate of working hours to produce more coal for the revolution. The effective production time of each shift underground in the entire mine has increased from the previous six hours to seven and a half hours, and the output of raw coal has been continuously increasing.

	From the mining bureau to the revolutionary committees of various mines in Jingxing, all have formulated systems for cadres to participate in labor and go down to the mines, coal mining teams, and work teams for on-site inspections, ensuring that the revolutionary committees maintain close contact with the masses. Members of the revolutionary committees all carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," leave their offices, and work together with the workers, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee members, a new atmosphere of hard work and decisive action is gradually forming throughout the mine area.

	Currently, the broad revolutionary workers of Jingxing Coal Mine are earnestly studying the PLA, extensively carrying out the "three loyalties" activity of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have stated that they will deepen their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, further promote their own ideological revolutionization, continue to focus on class struggle, promote revolution and production, and strive to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　永远忠于毛主席  认真学习解放军
　　井陉煤矿工人为革命多产煤
　　全矿区连续十六个月超额完成国家原煤生产和掘进计划
    据新华社石家庄九日电　河北省井陉矿务局的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在驻矿人民解放军支左人员帮助下，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产逐月上升。从去年一月到今年四月，全矿区连续十六个月超额完成了国家原煤生产计划和掘进计划。
    井陉煤矿是一座开采了六十多年的老矿山。生产设备陈旧，井下地质条件复杂。过去，这个矿的一小撮走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，在矿内鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，推行生产第一、技术第一、物质刺激等一套反革命修正主义路线。生产上发生了问题，总是埋怨机器设备不好，埋怨井下地质条件复杂，结果生产一直很不稳定。这个矿的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，组织全矿革命职工认真活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，狠抓阶级斗争，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线开展了革命的大批判。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，这个矿的革命委员会，闻风而动，组织全矿革命职工，从矿务局、矿井、车间、采煤队、班组直到职工家庭，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全矿区到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处是革命大批判的战场。
    经过革命的大批判，矿区革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，阶级斗争观念有了很大加强。他们以革命统帅生产，向阶级敌人发动了主动的猛烈的进攻。有一个时期，一矿采煤二队每到出煤最多的关键时刻，就发生机电事故，影响出煤，有时甚至一个班连一吨煤也运不出来。有人认为，井下巷道窄，顶板压力大，机电事故多是难免的。也有的人认为，井下运输设备陈旧，不好维护。在驻矿解放军支左人员的帮助下，采煤二队工人带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席的要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切的伟大教导，提高了阶级斗争观念，擦亮了眼睛。经过大家的揭发和调查，原来这个采煤队的一个“机电工”是一个长期隐藏在工人队伍里的历史反革命分子。把这个历史反革命分子揭露出来以后，几个月来，采煤队再没有发生过一次停产半小时以上的重大机电事故，原煤产量蒸蒸日上。
    全矿革命职工和新老干部，还遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，广泛开展谈心活动，并且在毛泽东思想学习班上，以毛泽东思想为最锐利的武器，认真斗私批修，促进自己的思想革命化。三矿有些井下工人对劳动纪律遵守不够。经过广泛开展谈心活动和在毛泽东思想学习班上斗私批修，老工人们还控诉了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治时期矿工们的苦难生活，使职工们大大提高了阶级觉悟。大家争出满勤，提高工时利用率，为革命多产煤。全矿每班井下有效生产时间由过去的六个小时增加到七个半小时，原煤产量不断上升。
    井陉从矿务局到各矿的革委会，都制定了干部参加劳动和下到矿井、采煤队、班组蹲点等制度，保证革委会和群众保持密切的联系。革委会成员都带着《毛主席语录》，走出办公室，同工人一起劳动，一起斗私批修。在革委会成员的带动下，一种艰苦奋斗，雷厉风行的新风气，正在全矿区逐渐形成。
    目前，井陉煤矿广大革命职工，正在认真学习解放军，广泛地开展永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。他们表示，要把对毛主席的无产阶级感情搞得浓浓的，进一步促进自己的思想革命化，继续狠抓阶级斗争，抓革命促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
