New China News Agency, Hanoi, May 9th – According to the Vietnam News Agency: On May 8th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to all members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, praising the great victories achieved by the military and people of the South recently. The full text is as follows:

	Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho,
	Members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam:

	Our compatriots, soldiers, and cadres in the South, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have launched a general offensive and uprising since the beginning of this spring, fighting very well and achieving tremendous victories. The military and people of the South have combined military, political, and guerrilla warfare closely, defeating 120,000 enemy troops, including over 50,000 American troops. They have achieved victories in both cities and countryside, striking at the enemy's bases, airports, ports, warehouses, and transportation. They have liberated many densely populated and vast areas, building while fighting, and both military and political forces have leaped forward. The fighting is good, and the implementation of the National Liberation Front's policies is also good. The troops wholeheartedly protect and assist the people, and the people wholeheartedly cherish and assist the troops, fighting bravely against the enemy together.

	In recent days, from Quang Tri–Thua Thien to the Mekong Delta, from the plains, coasts to the highlands, the military and people of the South have simultaneously attacked the American puppet forces, achieving tremendous victories, inflicting heavier losses on them, and causing them to panic even more.

	Thus, the heroic military and people of the entire South, men, women, old, young, Kinh people, and ethnic minorities, main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units have all achieved outstanding merits. Everywhere in the South, the fighting is good, the stronger we fight, the more fiercely we fight, the greater the victories we achieve.

	I am very pleased to ask Comrade Chairman and all members to convey my most cordial greetings and highest praise to all our compatriots in the South, to the warriors and cadres on all battlefields. I cordially greet all patriotic people, all elders, and all warrior mothers. I commend the youth and children for their bravery in resisting the Americans and saving the country, achieving many merits.

	The victories of our military and people in the South are tremendous and comprehensive, making our compatriots nationwide and brothers and friends from the five continents feel joyful and inspired. The cause of our people's resistance against the Americans and saving the country is thriving and steadily advancing towards complete victory.

	Our people love peace very much. But to have true peace, we must have independence and freedom. The American imperialists must stop their war of aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all their troops back to their own country, and let our people decide their own fate, then there will be peace immediately.

	At present, although the American imperialists have suffered a great defeat in Vietnam, been isolated in the world and within the United States, and fallen into a desperate situation, they are still very stubborn and cunning. They talk about peace talks, but their hands are still strengthening the war.

	Therefore, our compatriots and warriors must be more united, always vigilant, and uphold the spirit of decisive battle and victory. We must fully develop our strengths, correct our weaknesses, overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifices, fight continuously, and launch widespread attacks to achieve greater new victories. The South and North must unite as one, launch a competition to kill the enemy and save the country. The American aggressors will surely suffer a complete defeat. Our compatriots in the South will surely be liberated. Our homeland Vietnam will surely be completely independent, free, and peacefully reunified! We are sure to win and march forward bravely!

	With cordial and victorious greetings!

	Ho Chi Minh
	May 8, 1968, Hanoi

    胡志明主席写信给阮友寿主席赞扬南方军民的巨大胜利
    号召军民决战决胜连续猛攻夺取更大胜利
    揭露美帝国主义嘴里说和平谈判，但它的手仍在加强战争
    新华社河内九日电　据越南通讯社报道：胡志明主席八日写信给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会各位成员，赞扬南方军民最近取得的巨大胜利，全文如下：阮友寿主席：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会各位成员：
    我们南方同胞、战士和干部在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，从今年初春起发动了总进攻和全面奋起斗争，打得很好，取得了十分巨大的胜利。南方军民发扬革命英雄主义，把军事、政治和兵运斗争紧密地结合起来，已经战胜了一百二十万敌军，其中包括五十多万美军；在城市和农村都取得了胜利，在敌军的基地、机场、港口、仓库、交通运输都打得好；又解放了许多居民稠密的辽阔地区，边战斗边建设，军事和政治力量都飞跃地壮大；战斗好，实现民族解放阵线的政策也好，部队全心全意地保卫和帮助人民，人民全心全意地爱护和帮助部队，同部队一起英勇杀敌。
    最近几天以来，从广治—承天到金瓯，从平原、沿海到高原，南方军民又同时进攻美伪集团，取得了十分巨大的胜利，使它们遭到了更加惨重的失败，更加惊慌失措。
    这样，英雄的南方全体军民，男女老幼、京族同胞和高山族同胞、主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队都建立了出色的战功。我们南方各地都打得好，越战越强，越打得猛，就越取得巨大的胜利。
    我十分高兴地请主席和各位向全体南方同胞、各个战场上的爱国武装力量的战士和干部们，转达我的最亲切的问候和最热烈的赞扬。我亲切地问候各位爱国人士、各位父老、各位战士母亲。伯伯表扬青年和儿童们奋勇抗美救国，建立了许多战功。
    我们南方军民的胜利是十分巨大和全面的，使全国同胞和五大洲的兄弟朋友们感到欢欣鼓舞。我国全体人民的抗美救国事业正在蓬勃发展，稳步地走向彻底胜利。
    我国人民十分热爱和平。但要有独立、自由，才有真正的和平。美帝国主义必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把它的军队全部撤回国，让我国人民自己决定自己的命运，那就立即有和平。
    目前，美帝国主义虽然已经在越南遭到大败，在世界上和美国国内遭到孤立，陷入狼狈的处境，但它还非常顽固和狡猾。它嘴里说和平谈判，但它的手仍在加强战争。
    因此，我国同胞和战士要更加紧密团结，时刻提高警惕和发扬决战决胜精神，大力发扬优点，改正缺点，克服一切艰苦，不怕任何牺牲，连续地打，广泛出击，夺取更大的新胜利。南北两方团结一致，展开杀敌救国竞赛，美国强盗就必将遭到彻底失败。南方同胞必将获得解放。祖国越南必将完全独立、自由，必将和平统一！稳操全胜勇向前！致亲切和决胜的敬礼！
                                                胡志明
                                  一九六八年五月八日于河内
