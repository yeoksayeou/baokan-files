The great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the brilliant "May 7th Directive" two years ago, stating: "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school."

The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region, with boundless loyalty and proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, have followed the path indicated by the brilliant "May 7th Directive," urging their horses forward and striding ahead. They have taken the brilliant "May 7th Directive" as the fundamental guideline for their unit's construction. Over the past two years, they have gone from land reclamation around Huai River to supporting agriculture in the Dabie Mountains, and then to supporting the leftist movement in Nanjing. Wherever they go, they establish a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Fighting at Chengxi Lake, the Lake Turns Redder

In the midst of the great victories of the Cultural Revolution, news of a heartening event spread from the banks of the Huai River: a large-scale modern agricultural farm at Chengxi Lake had been established.

In the past, Chengxi Lake was a vast expanse of marshland, "white and endless, water meeting the sky, a hundred miles of desolation with few people." But now, a hundred-mile-long embankment has tamed the thousand-year-old flood, and on the 136,000-plus acres of land, waves of wheat shimmer golden, and fields of beans glow green. This transformation, this miracle, was created by the cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region and other units, in just half a year. This is a new victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a new victory for Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive."

In September 1966, this unit received orders to march to Huaxi and reclaim land around Chengxi Lake. The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers immediately sprang into action. The unit's leaders rushed to the companies overnight and studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" with everyone. The cadres and soldiers, filled with boundless love and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao, said excitedly: The "May 7th Directive" is the guiding principle for our army's revolutionary construction. The higher-ups, following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," ordered us to reclaim land around the lake, which is to ensure that we never detach ourselves from labor, from the masses, and from the practice of class struggle. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and turn the Chengxi Lake area into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

This unit, in the midst of fierce battles, followed Chairman Mao's campaigns north and south, achieving numerous victories and earning the honorable title of "Linfen Brigade." The cadres and soldiers regarded executing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as a new starting point for advancing to a higher stage of revolutionization. As soon as they arrived at Chengxi Lake, they threw themselves into intense battles.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." Just as the cadres and soldiers were working hard, someone on the construction site proposed the slogan "Seize the clear weather, start work early, focus on earthwork, and strive for merit." As soon as this slogan appeared, it caught the attention of the unit's Party Committee. The committee members believed that this slogan reflected some comrades' neglect of the fundamental direction of emphasizing proletarian politics and emphasized earthwork, which was a reflection of the bourgeois military line. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to hold a big discussion throughout the unit on the topic "What task has Chairman Mao given us?" The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers, armed with Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan for promoting the bourgeois military line. They said: Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," we must not only reclaim land around the lake but, more importantly, establish a revolutionary school here. We must not only build a hundred-mile-long embankment at Chengxi Lake for flood control and drainage but also build a red embankment in our minds to prevent revisionism.

Awareness was raised, the direction was corrected, and the atmosphere of political command over construction became thicker. The cadres and soldiers put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all their work. After a day of labor, covered in mud, they first thought of the "Three Articles." They regarded the struggle between "public" and "private" as a reflection of the struggle between the two lines and saw every action of breaking private desires and establishing public spirit as an action loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasping the revolutionization of thought. A leader of the unit, Song Kongguang, worked with the soldiers in the spy company and discovered that some soldiers had clear boundaries at the junction of the companies, "afraid of losing out." He immediately realized that the boundary was a "private line" that constrained the soldiers' revolutionary thoughts, and the clearer the boundary, the heavier the "private line." Aiming at this problem, he first led the company's cadres to the junction with the sister unit, took the lead in digging soil, and broke through the "boundary line." He said: "We not only want the progress of construction but also the progress of our thought reform. Otherwise, it will foster selfish thoughts, produce a purely military viewpoint, which is against Mao Zedong Thought." His words inspired the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers, and soon a new atmosphere of breaking through the junction and eliminating the "private line" emerged.

"We have transformed Chengxi Lake, and we have also transformed ourselves." This is the deepest feeling that the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers gained from this school of Mao Zedong Thought at Chengxi Lake. The unit's Party Committee regarded the harsh environment of Chengxi Lake as the best classroom for tempering the unit's fighting will and promoting the revolutionization of thought, constantly encouraging the cadres and soldiers to advance toward the spiritual world of communism, washing away selfish desires with sweat and uprooting revisionism with labor, making a generation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, grow rapidly here. They deeply felt that to build a highly revolutionary and highly combat-ready army, one must follow the brilliant path opened by the "May 7th Directive."

Bringing Spring to the Dabie Mountains, Tempering Loyalty in Wind and Waves

Last April, just as the task of reclaiming land around Chengxi Lake was completed, this unit received a new combat mission: to march to the Dabie Mountains to support agriculture. The cadres and soldiers wiped off the mud from their bodies, put down their tools, picked up their backpacks, took Mao Zedong's works, and formed thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They marched into the new classroom of Mao Zedong Thought in the Dabie Mountains, facing the class struggle storms.

At that time, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the Dabie Mountains was excellent, and the people with a glorious revolutionary tradition in the old revolutionary base areas had been fully mobilized. However, Liu Shaoqi's agents in Anhui, Li Baohua, Huang Yan, and their ilk, unwilling to accept their failure, frantically promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique," persecuting the vast majority of grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside, and some places' spring plowing and production were disrupted. At this critical juncture, the unit's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, carrying the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," dispersed to 15,000 production teams in the mountainous areas. They vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," extensively mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants, fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique," greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses; at the same time, they started from political and ideological education, helping revolutionary cadres and the bourgeois reactionary line to draw a clear line, bravely stepping forward, shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, quickly establishing and improving the leading cadres, and launching a hot spring plowing and production campaign.

In the process of grasping revolution and promoting production, the vivid class struggle reality in the countryside gave the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers a lively class struggle and line struggle lesson. Everyone deeply felt that the countryside classroom was the largest, the teachers were the most numerous, the textbooks were the most lively, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were the best teachers. Therefore, wherever they went, they studied Mao Zedong's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants and carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao the most and hated Liu Shaoqi the most. The cadres and soldiers, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, used Chairman Mao's teaching that "people's communes are good" to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's black goods of "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms," exposing his heinous crimes of destroying people's communes, dismantling the collective economy, and attempting to restore capitalism. The cadres and soldiers, together with the old Red Army soldiers and old Red Guards of the old revolutionary base areas in the Dabie Mountains, used Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of canceling armed struggle. They studied Chairman Mao's teaching with the poor and lower-middle peasants over and over again: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." They resolved to firmly grasp the gun, defend the proletarian red political power.

"Seeing the mountains turn red all over, the forests turn red layer by layer." The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in the Dabie Mountains, wherever they went, studied Mao Zedong's works with the local revolutionary masses, making the learning atmosphere thick, turning the Dabie Mountains into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought. They not only propagated to the masses but also tempered themselves, forging a deeper proletarian sentiment between the military and the people.

Raising the Red Flag in Nanjing, Climbing New Heights of Loyalty

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary people led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Nanjing is a key city in southeastern China. In the past, it was the lair of the Kuomintang reactionaries' counter-revolutionary rule. After liberation, Liu Shaoqi and his agents here frantically promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism. Here, it has always been an important battlefield for the fierce struggle between the revolutionary people and the remnants of the American Kuomintang reactionaries and a small number of capitalist roaders.

Last July, at the critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Nanjing area, this unit came from the Dabie Mountains to Nanjing to support the leftist movement.

As soon as they arrived in Nanjing, they clearly stated: "We follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses."

In the fierce and complex class struggle, the cadres and soldiers followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advanced bravely. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they would go deep into factories, schools, offices, and streets, vigorously propagating and implementing them, handing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses as the strongest weapon for uniting themselves and striking the enemy. They regarded the process of propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a process of tempering loyalty. When a certain unit's Eighth Company's Fourth Platoon went to a factory to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the class enemies sabotaged them and did not let them enter the factory. But they did not lose heart and propagated Mao Zedong Thought more actively. They were not allowed into the workshop, so they went to the dormitory, helping the workers with their chores while propagating, making the revolutionary masses truly feel that the army and they have heart-to-heart connections. From then on, the soldiers were warmly welcomed every time they went to the factory to propagate.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, implemented this, and in a short time, helped the revolutionary masses establish 4,700-plus Mao Zedong Thought study classes. A soldier from the Fifth Company, Zhang Ruzong, had a low cultural level. He went to a university in Nanjing to hold a study class. At first, someone worried: Could a soldier help college students hold a study class? However, Zhang Ruzong, with a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions and shared his experiences of studying the "Five Articles," speaking vividly and deeply. The revolutionary teachers and students listened and praised, saying: "Our cultural level is higher than his, but our ideological level is not as high as his." Everyone unanimously said that they must learn from the People's Liberation Army and be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. The entire school quickly launched a wave of criticizing selfishness, criticizing revisionism, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Zhang Ruzong's experience of helping revolutionary teachers and students hold a study class provided an example for the entire unit. The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers more consciously threw themselves into the tide of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The military and the people jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, like mountains of flowers in full bloom, and the waves of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination surged forward, rolling on.

"When the people are happy, the counter-revolutionaries are in pain." In the face of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class enemies, unwilling to accept defeat, blew a new wind of rehabilitation. The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through the new tricks of the class enemies quickly and stood firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions, fiercely striking down this evil wind. In the struggle against the wind of rehabilitation, the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers further realized the long-term and complex nature of class struggle and line struggle. They said: "If, in the midst of drumbeats, we do not hear the class enemies' sharp knife-grinding sounds; if, in the midst of a great situation, we forget about class struggle, the victory fruits we have already obtained will be lost again." They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and went to the Rainflower Terrace Martyrs' Cemetery to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, further igniting their hatred for traitors, spies, a small number of unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries. They helped the revolutionary masses from factories to schools, from offices to streets, igniting more intense revolutionary flames to encircle the class enemies.

Fiery trials temper true gold, and struggles temper loyalty. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, this unit's school of Mao Zedong Thought has reached a new level, and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers' class consciousness and line struggle consciousness have reached new heights. The thought revolutionization construction of the unit is getting better and better. Through reviewing the past two years of combat journey, the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers have a deeper understanding: Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is a lighthouse shining brightly on the construction of our army's revolutionization. They resolved to, in the future thought revolutionization construction of the unit and in executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and more firmly follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao! Advance! Advance!

The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region, who reclaimed land around Chengxi Lake, not only achieved results in implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" but also made new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the leftist support mission at the Nanjing Railway Bureau's Zhonghua Gate line, a certain unit's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, with "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, helped various stations on the line establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, effectively promoting the thought revolutionization of revolutionary workers.

　　在火热的斗争中办好毛泽东思想大学校
　　——出席南京部队第三届活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的先进集体某部党委贯彻执行毛主席“五·七”指示的事迹
    伟大统帅毛主席两年前发出的光辉的“五·七”指示指出：“人民解放军应该是一个大学校。”
    南京部队某部广大指战员怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，沿着“五·七”指示指引的道路，扬鞭策马，阔步向前。他们把光辉的“五·七”指示当作部队建设的根本。两年来，他们从皖西围湖造田，到大别山区支农，又到南京支左，走到那里，就把毛泽东思想大学校办到那里。
    奋战城西湖　湖变人更红
    在无产阶级文化大革命接连取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，淮河岸边传出了一个振奋人心的喜讯：城西湖大型现代化农场诞生了。
    过去，城西湖是一望无际的泽国，“白茫茫，水连天，百里荒芜少人烟”。可是现在，百里长堤锁住了千年的水害，在十三万六千多亩的土地上，麦浪闪金光，豆海放碧彩。这变化，这奇迹，是南京部队某部指战员和兄弟部队一起，仅仅用半年时间创造出来的。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利，这是毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示的新胜利。
    一九六六年九月，这支部队接到进军皖西，围垦城西湖的命令。广大指战员立即行动起来。部队的领导干部，连夜赶到连队，和大家一起学习毛主席的“五·七”指示。指战员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，激动地说：“五·七”指示是我军革命化建设的指针。上级遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，命令我们围湖造田，就是要我们永远不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，不脱离阶级斗争的实践。我们一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想，把城西湖地区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    这个部队在战火纷飞的岁月，紧跟毛主席南征北战，屡建战功，荣获过“临汾旅”的光荣称号。指战员们把执行毛主席的“五·七”指示看成是向革命化更高阶段前进的新起点。他们一到城西湖就投入了紧张的战斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”正当指战员们紧张施工的时候，工地上有人提出了“抢晴天，早开工，抓土方，争立功”的口号，这个口号一出现，就引起了部队党委的注意。党委委员们认为：这个口号反映某些同志在执行任务时忽略了突出无产阶级政治的根本方向，突出土方，是突出军事技术的反映。于是，党委决定：全部队以“毛主席交给我们的是什么任务”为题，展开一场大讨论。广大指战员以毛主席的“五·七”指示为武器，狠批反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线。他们说：遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，我们不仅要围湖造田，更重要的是要在这里办革命化的大学校，我们不仅在城西湖修起防洪排水的百里大堤，而且要在思想上筑起防修反修的红色大堤。
    认识提高了，方向端正了，政治统帅施工的空气浓厚了，指战员们把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。每天劳动下来一身泥巴，首先想到的是“老三篇”，他们把“公”和“私”的斗争，看作是两条路线斗争的反映，把破私立公的每个行动，看成是忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的行动，狠抓思想革命化。某部领导干部宋孔广在特务连和战士一起劳动，发现有的战士在连与连的接合部上界线分明，“怕吃亏”。他立即意识到，界线是束缚战士思想革命化的“私线”，界线越清，“私线”越重。针对这个问题，他首先带领连队干部来到与兄弟部队相连的接合部上，带头挖土，突破“分界线”。他说：“我们不仅要施工的进度，更要我们思想改造的进度，否则，就会助长私心杂念，产生单纯军事观点，这就是违背毛泽东思想。”他的话，启发了广大指战员，很快出现了打破接合部，消灭“私线”的新气象。
    “我们改造了城西湖，也改造了自己”。这是广大指战员在城西湖这个毛泽东思想大学校里得到的最深切的体会。部队党委把城西湖的艰苦环境，看作磨炼部队战斗意志、促进部队思想革命化的最好课堂，不断鼓励干部战士向共产主义精神世界迈进，用汗水洗私心，用劳动锄修根，使一代无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业接班人，从这里迅速成长起来。他们深深地体会到：要建设一支非常革命化、非常战斗化的部队，一定要走“五·七”指示开辟的光辉道路。
    大别山区送春风　风里浪里炼忠心
    去年四月，围垦城西湖的任务刚刚完成，这个部队又接到新的战斗任务：开赴大别山区执行支农任务。指战员们擦去身上的泥巴，放下手中的工具，背起行装，带上革命宝书毛主席著作，组成几千支毛泽东思想宣传队，迎着大别山区阶级斗争的风暴，迈进了毛泽东思想大学校的新课堂。
    当时，大别山地区无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，具有光荣革命传统的老革命根据地人民已经充分发动起来。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流不甘心他们的失败，疯狂推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，迫害农村广大基层干部和贫下中农，一些地方春耕生产遭到破坏。就在这个关头，部队毛泽东思想宣传队带着《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，分散到山区一万五千个生产队，大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，广泛发动贫下中农，狠批“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，大大提高了广大革命群众阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟；同时，又从政治思想教育入手，帮助革命干部和资产阶级反动路线划清界线，勇敢地站出来，挑起革命和生产的两副重担，迅速建立和健全了领导班子，掀起了热气腾腾的春耕生产高潮。
    在抓革命促生产的过程中，农村活生生的阶级斗争现实，给广大指战员上了一堂生动的阶级斗争和路线斗争的课。大家深深体会到，农村课堂最大，教员最多，教材最活，贫下中农是最好的教员。因此，他们每到一地，就和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，开展革命大批判。贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫。指战员们和贫下中农一起，用毛主席“人民公社好”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”的黑货，揭发他破坏人民公社、瓦解集体经济，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。指战员们和大别山老根据地的老红军、老赤卫队员一起，用毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫取消武装斗争的滔天罪行。他们和贫下中农一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”。决心紧握枪杆子，保卫无产阶级红色政权。
    “看万山红遍，层林尽染”。广大指战员在大别山区，走到那里，就和那里的革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，把学习空气搞得浓浓的，使大别山区变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。他们既宣传了群众，又锻炼了自己，军民之间结下了更深厚的无产阶级感情。
    南京城里举红旗攀登“忠”字新高峰
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”南京是我国东南重镇，过去是国民党反动派实行反革命统治的老窝。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人又在这里疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。这里，一直是革命人民和美蒋反动派残渣余孽以及一小撮走资派激烈搏斗的重要战场。
    去年七月，正当南京地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，这个部队又从大别山来到南京执行支左任务。
    他们一到南京，就旗帜鲜明地表示：“我们听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚决支持左派广大群众。”
    指战员们在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。每当毛主席的最新指示一下达，他们就深入到工厂、学校、机关、街道，大力宣传、落实，把毛主席的最新指示交给广大革命群众，作为团结自己、打击敌人的最强大的武器。他们把宣传毛主席最新指示的过程，当作锤炼忠心的过程。某部八连四排到一个工厂宣传毛主席最新指示时，阶级敌人进行破坏，不让他们进厂。但他们不灰心，更积极地宣传毛泽东思想。不让进车间，他们就到宿舍，一边帮助职工料理家务，一边进行宣传，使革命群众确实感到解放军和自己心连心。从此，战士们每次进厂宣传都受到了热烈的欢迎。
    毛主席指出：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”广大指战员以最大的热情、最快的速度贯彻执行，在很短的时间里，帮助革命群众，办起了四千七百多个毛泽东思想学习班。某部五连战士张如宗文化水平不高，他到南京一个大学办学习班。起初，有人担心：一个战士帮大学生办学习班能行吗？但是，张如宗凭着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，宣传毛主席的最新指示，向革命师生介绍自己学习“老五篇”的体会，讲得生动、深刻，革命师生听了之后连连称赞说：“我们文化程度比他高，思想水平却比不上他。”大家一致表示，一定要向解放军学习，永远忠于毛主席。全校很快掀起了斗私批修、落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。张如宗帮助革命师生办学习班的经验，为全部队提供了榜样。广大指战员更加自觉地投入了大办毛泽东思想学习班的浪潮中。军民合办毛泽东思想学习班有如山花烂漫，革命大联合和革命三结合的浪潮，汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，阶级敌人不甘心失败，又刮起一阵翻案风。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大指战员，心明眼亮，很快识破了阶级敌人的新阴谋，紧紧和无产阶级革命派站在一起，狠狠打击这股妖风。在反击翻案风的斗争中，广大指战员进一步认识了阶级斗争和路线斗争的长期性、复杂性。他们说：“如果在一片锣鼓声中，听不到阶级敌人一片霍霍磨刀声；如果在一片大好形势下，忘记了阶级斗争，已经取得的胜利果实，就会重新丧失。”他们反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》，并到雨花台烈士墓前，缅怀革命先烈，更加激发了他们对叛徒、特务、一小撮顽固不化的走资派和一切反革命分子的刻骨仇恨。他们帮助革命群众从工厂到学校，从机关到街道，烧起了更旺的围歼阶级敌人的革命烈火。
    烈火炼真金，斗争炼忠心。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，这个部队毛泽东思想大学校办出了新水平，广大指战员阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟达到了新高度。部队思想革命化建设越来越好。通过回顾两年来的战斗历程，广大指战员更加深刻地认识到：毛主席的“五·七”指示，是照耀我军革命化建设的光芒四射的灯塔。他们决心在今后部队思想革命化建设和在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更坚定地沿着毛主席指引的革命航道前进！再前进！
