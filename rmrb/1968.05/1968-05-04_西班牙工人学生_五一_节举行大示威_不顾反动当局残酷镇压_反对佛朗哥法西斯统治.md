Spanish workers and students hold large demonstration on May Day
Defying the reactionary government's brutal suppression, opposing Franco's fascist rule

	Newspaper of the Communist Party of China, May 3rd, Madrid News: In many cities in Spain, workers and students, defying the reactionary government's brutal suppression, held demonstrations and parades on May Day, bringing the nationwide struggle against Franco's fascist rule, which began on April 30th, to a climax.

	In the capital, Madrid, five thousand workers and students, following the large-scale demonstration on April 30th, held an even more massive demonstration on May Day. Demonstrators from all directions flooded the streets, shouting slogans against Franco's fascist rule, demanding freedom and democracy, and engaged in fierce battles with the armed police sent to suppress them. Workers and students threw stones at the police and police cars, sending the fascist police into disarray. Demonstrators also smashed the windows of more than ten large shops and banks, causing the city's traffic to come to a halt for a period.

	Similar demonstrations were also held in the Basque region and many provincial cities on the same day.

	The nationwide "struggle day" against Franco's fascist regime, which began on April 30th, was initiated by the underground trade unions in Spain. It called on workers to hold various demonstrations over the three days before and after May Day, International Labor Day, to protest against rising prices, increasing unemployment, and the reactionary government's brutal suppression of workers, demanding trade union freedom.

	The underground trade unions in Spain stated in a bulletin on May 1st that despite the brutal suppression by the Franco reactionary government, Spanish workers have achieved victory in this anti-fascist dictatorship struggle. The bulletin pointed out that the struggle of the Spanish working class "has entered a new stage full of hope."

　　西班牙工人学生“五一”节举行大示威
　　不顾反动当局残酷镇压  反对佛朗哥法西斯统治
    新华社三日讯　马德里消息：西班牙许多城市的工人和学生不顾反动当局的残酷镇压，在“五一”国际劳动节举行游行示威，使得从四月三十日开始的反佛朗哥法西斯统治的全国性斗争达到高潮。
    在首都马德里，五千工人和学生继四月三十日举行的大规模示威之后，又在“五一”这一天举行了声势更加浩大的示威游行。示威者从四面八方涌向街头，高呼反对佛朗哥法西斯统治、争取自由和民主的口号，同前来镇压的武装警察展开了英勇搏斗。工人和学生们用石块袭击警察和警车，把大批法西斯警察打得晕头转向。示威者还砸烂了十多家大商店和银行的窗户，并使市内的交通一度陷于停顿。
    在巴斯克地区和许多省的城市中也在同一天举行了类似的示威。
    从四月三十日开始的反对佛朗哥法西斯政权全国“斗争日”是由西班牙地下工会组织发起的。它号召工人在“五一”国际劳动节前后三天举行各种示威，抗议物价上涨、失业增加和反动统治当局对工人的残酷镇压，要求工会自由。
    西班牙地下工会组织一日晚上在一项公报中说，尽管佛朗哥反动当局进行残酷镇压，西班牙工人在这次反法西斯独裁的斗争中取得了胜利。公报指出，西班牙工人阶级的斗争“已经进入一个充满了希望的新阶段”。
