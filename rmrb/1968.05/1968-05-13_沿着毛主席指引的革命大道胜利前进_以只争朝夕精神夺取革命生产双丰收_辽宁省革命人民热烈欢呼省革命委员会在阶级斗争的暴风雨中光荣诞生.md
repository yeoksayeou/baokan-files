The 28 million revolutionary people of Liaoning Province are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joy, enthusiastically hailing the birth of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee amidst the storm of class struggle, enthusiastically hailing the red and vibrant Northeast, and enthusiastically hailing the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

On this day of great rejoicing, from Shanhaiguan to the Yalu River, from the shores of the Bohai Sea to the plains of Liaoning, in the famous steel city of Anshan, the coal city of Fushun, and in cities such as Dalian, Benxi, Fuxin, Jinzhou, Yingkou, and Dandong, as well as throughout the vast rural areas of the province, victory songs resound, and everywhere is a scene of jubilation. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses, with deep proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the red revolutionary treasure book, sincerely wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! They repeatedly shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from all over the province unanimously expressed that they will, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao, with the spirit of "seizing the day," they will redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, study new problems that arise in the movement, discover and support new revolutionary things, and vigorously follow the developing new situation, advance with victory, and achieve an all-round victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They vow to build Liaoning Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought university. Revolutionary masses from various places also expressed that they will wholeheartedly cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committee, help it to consolidate and develop continuously, and prevent class enemies from shaking and overthrowing the revolutionary committee from the right or ultra-"left" side, making it a battle command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizes proletarian politics.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses of the people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." At this moment of celebrating victory, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from various places in Liaoning reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching, determined to carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continue to grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist revisionist wind, and carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism. They will thoroughly criticize and expose the traitor, scoundrel, and diehard in power taking the capitalist road within the Party, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning. They must strengthen their awareness of the enemy, heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and resolutely root out the special agents of the US imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, and Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as hidden or infiltrated counter-revolutionaries. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from various places also expressed that they will continue to make efforts to unite and educate the vast majority of cadres and masses, strictly distinguish between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, continuously strengthen the revolutionary ranks, unite and win over allies, and make all revolutionary forces, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, converge into a mighty revolutionary army, jointly fight against the enemy, and achieve an all-round victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On this day of celebrating victory, the revolutionary people of the entire Liaoning Province are determined to raise high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, and resolutely unite with the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Liaoning Province who are loyal to Chairman Mao, fight together, and win together, further consolidating the great iron wall.

Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and broad revolutionary masses from various places are determined, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, to further implement the great policy of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." They will make greater contributions on the fronts of national defense, industry, agriculture, transportation, and other sectors. Steel workers in Anshan expressed that they will definitely use revolution to lead production, with the fastest speed, highest efficiency, best quality, and lowest cost, produce more high-quality steel to support the socialist construction of the entire country. Revolutionary miners in the coal cities of Fushun and Fuxin expressed that they will definitely not disappoint the expectations of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, thoroughly smash the evil plots of class enemies to sabotage production, and use practical actions to defend and consolidate the newly born proletarian revolutionary power.
