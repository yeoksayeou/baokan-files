A Soviet revolutionary organization opposing the Khrushchev revisionist clique, the "Stalin Group," recently circulated an article titled "The Truth About the Cultural Revolution," which enthusiastically praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao in China. The article denounces the Soviet revisionist renegade clique for restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union and for their shameless slanders against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This demonstrates the heroic spirit and revolutionary determination of the Soviet proletariat.

The article states that the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a time of fierce class struggle—between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between two roads. The struggle against restoration and counter-restoration is the main content of class struggle throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, from the transition from capitalism to communism.

The article points out that in a socialist country, there are three possible paths to the restoration of capitalism:

First, before the victory of socialism, the overthrown but not yet eliminated exploiting classes may regain power.

Second, restoration may occur as a result of imperialist aggression.

Third, through the path of peaceful evolution.

The struggle against the first two paths of restoration is easier because in these cases, we face clearly defined enemies whose direction of attack is clear. However, peaceful evolution is a different matter. It is the most dangerous and insidious path.

Peaceful evolution is particularly dangerous for the working class and all laboring people because:

First, we are dealing with disguised enemies who hide within our ranks, using our slogans to cover themselves, making it extremely difficult to identify these enemies.

Second, the threat of peaceful evolution is generally underestimated.

The article states that peaceful evolution is the result of the degeneration of party and state leadership, causing a gradual change in the nature and essence of socialist countries and communist parties. The ultimate result of peaceful evolution is the restoration of capitalism.

When discussing the reasons for the danger of peaceful evolution in socialist countries, the article points out that while the proletariat can politically and economically defeat the bourgeoisie in a relatively short historical period, the struggle in the ideological realm will last for a very long time. This is because it involves the living souls of people. New socialist thoughts, customs, and habits cannot immediately dominate after political and economic changes; it takes a considerable amount of time, and even more so to achieve complete victory. In addition, there is the corrosive influence of capitalist encirclement. This hostile ideology breeds unprincipledness, anti-communism, bourgeois individualism, private property mentality, the desire for wealth, nationalism, chauvinism, cosmopolitanism, bourgeois morality, and so on. Due to the influence of this ideology in our countries, the result is the degeneration and bourgeoisification of our people. In simple terms, there are many people in our society and other socialist countries who are tainted with bourgeois ideas: degenerate elements, careerists, "communist" bureaucrats, bureaucratism, those who only care about personal prosperity, the greedy, and outright anti-socialist enemies. These people inevitably infiltrate the party (including the leadership), primarily because the party is in power. These people are objectively domestic bourgeois elements, remnants of the exploiting classes, and agents of international imperialism. If their harmful effects are not eliminated, then at a certain point, there will be the possibility of them seizing power in the party and the state.

The article points out that the bourgeois elements and agents of international imperialism who infiltrate the party can only seize power by eliminating Marxist-Leninist leadership.

The article uses the example of the Khrushchev clique seizing power in the Soviet party and state to illustrate this point. The article states that the seizure of power by Khrushchev and his accomplices began with the death of J.V. Stalin. After Stalin's death, degenerate elements in the party and the country launched a very rampant power struggle. Seeing that they finally had the opportunity to seize power, they attempted to expel Marxism-Leninism from the leadership by slandering the core of Marxism-Leninism. It was for this purpose that they concocted the myth of "cult of personality." The goal of this myth was to overthrow and then expel the Bolshevik core of our party, creating conditions to replace the proletarian line of Lenin-Stalin with a degenerate, revisionist line.

The article states that the conspiracy of the revisionists to seize power and peaceful evolution begins with ideology, culture, and the creation and preparation of public opinion.

They work from three directions:

First, the so-called "struggle against past mistakes"—abandoning the "old" ideology (Marxism-Leninism).

Second, the so-called "creative development of Marxism-Leninism"—creating a "new" ideology.

Third, in literature, art, and daily life, cultivating bourgeois ideology—to make the working class and all laboring people politically apathetic, fostering greed and the desire for personal gain.

In simple terms, they start by replacing proletarian ideology with bourgeois ideology.

After thoroughly discussing the possibility of capitalist restoration, we conclude: after the establishment and consolidation of the new system, the main danger in socialist countries is peaceful evolution; peaceful evolution is carried out by degenerate elements and enemies of the laboring people who have seized the leadership of the party and the state; the seizure of power by revisionists and peaceful evolution begins with ideology, culture, and the creation and preparation of public opinion.

The article states that after the revisionist traitor clique seized power in the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, and a series of other countries, the issue of struggling against the revisionist traitor clique is particularly acute before the international proletariat and the communist movement.

The article emphasizes that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has answered these questions.

When discussing the basic points of Chairman Mao's theory on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the article points out:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a resolute attack on the bourgeoisie and their agents on the ideological front, with the mission of: in addition to politically and economically destroying the bourgeoisie, also destroying it ideologically.

The strategic goal of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate the threat of capitalist restoration, eliminate the possibility of peaceful evolution in socialist countries, and defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The tasks facing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, or in other words, the specific paths to achieving the strategic goal, can be summarized as follows:

Expose, severely criticize, and isolate the degenerate elements and careerists who have infiltrated the party; remove those who have opportunistically entered the party and those who are passive;

Establish state and party institutions that are free from bureaucracy and are as close to the people as possible;

Eliminate bourgeois trends in the ideological and cultural spheres, declare war on bourgeois thought, customs, and habits, prevent these thoughts and customs from coming in from abroad, promote the further prosperity and development of our proletarian thought and culture, and always and everywhere propagate and disseminate Marxism-Leninism;

Maximize the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, absorb the masses to decisively and systematically participate in all state affairs;

In this struggle, cultivate a new generation of steadfast communists, educate the youth to continue the revolution.

How to accomplish these tasks? What method can complete these tasks? This method, the method of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the mass line.

This revolution has roused and mobilized an extremely broad mass of people, showing them that politics is not just the affair of leaders, as the revisionists and degenerate elements have tirelessly instilled, but the people's affair—a matter of the utmost importance to them. This revolution shows that it is the masses who can best and most thoroughly expose the degenerate elements, careerists, and enemies of the people, and it is the masses who should judge who among the leaders is bad and who is good, who is a friend and who is an enemy of the working class and all laboring people. In simple terms, only the masses led by the Bolsheviks can uproot and eliminate the bourgeois line, and only by relying on the masses and through the actions of the masses can the grand tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried out, achieving its goal—preventing capitalist restoration.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the continuation and development of the universal path of the October Revolution, a necessary result of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. All countries under the dictatorship of the proletariat must inevitably go through this stage of the socialist revolution.

In simple terms, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is consistent in class content but different in national form, is a universal law of Marxism-Leninism.

The article then exposes and condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership's various attempts to distort the true situation in China and slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The article states that the Soviet people want to know the truth about China. However, the official propaganda in the Soviet Union distorts the true situation in China in every possible way, using all means. In this slander campaign, Soviet publications use their own materials and bourgeois news agencies' materials equally, which in itself shows that the interests of the Soviet propaganda apparatus and the bourgeois propaganda apparatus are the same. Not only that, the "reports" from bourgeois newspapers seem more "humble" and "objective" than the shameless articles in *Pravda* and other official publications. For this reason, the bourgeois propaganda apparatus says: the Soviet Union has provided them with the best materials for their purposes! And indeed, this is the best, most complete, and most systematic collection of all the anti-China slanders spread by the enemies of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is precisely this that makes exposing this anti-China slander an urgent and necessary task for all those loyal to Lenin and Stalin, all those who want to struggle against degenerate behavior.

The article points out that all struggles are struggles for power. No one can deny that the entire party and all the Chinese people participated in this struggle, which is the struggle of the laboring masses. This means that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is not a personal quarrel but a principled struggle, a struggle for the interests of the entire party and all the people.

The Cultural Revolution is a principled struggle between the Chinese Bolsheviks led by Mao Zedong and the opportunist faction within the party.

This struggle is the logical continuation and result of the long-term struggle between the CPC and the Khrushchev-style revisionists. The Soviet revisionist politicians spread rumors that the masses, under the leadership of the Bolshevik core of the CPC, seizing power from the opportunists, is an unprincipled struggle between factions, which defames the struggle of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, thereby supporting the enemies of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. This is pure anti-China, anti-communist propaganda.

When exposing the Soviet revisionists' lies about "the Chinese working class not supporting the Cultural Revolution" and slandering Chinese youth, the article states that Chinese workers have taken control of the management of enterprises, workers are the backbone of the new party and state leadership, and workers are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. These facts alone refute such malicious fabrications.

Chinese youth participating in the Cultural Revolution is also very important for the youth themselves. The youth have undergone the tempering of the Cultural Revolution furnace, which has given them valuable experience in actual struggle, strengthening their communist spirit. This is the best way to cultivate a new generation of warriors to take over from the older generation of Chinese Bolsheviks. This tempering has provided the party with a reliable and inexhaustible reserve of young people.

When exposing the Soviet revisionists' slander against the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the article points out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army indeed plays a great role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The article states: What is the Chinese People's Liberation Army? It is the workers and peasants, it is the Chinese people—only armed people. The People's Liberation Army is not only an armed part of the workers and peasants but also the most disciplined, most cultured, and most ideological part of the workers and peasants.

The article also refutes the Soviet revisionists' claim that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is "directed against the Chinese Communist Party."

The article states that the broadest masses of the people participate in the Cultural Revolution together with the party, which does not in the slightest damage the prestige of the Chinese Communist Party because these masses are acting entirely under the leadership of the party and according to the party's instructions. The masses' participation in the struggle against bourgeois degeneration and opportunism can only make them more Bolshevik, unite them around the Marxist core of the party, educate them with communist and revolutionary practice spirit, making them a powerful reserve force for the party.

The masses, under the leadership of Mao Zedong's party, actively fight for the party's cause, proving the maturity of the Chinese Communist Party, proving that the policy of the Chinese party is correct, and proving the great unity of the Chinese party and people. The Chinese Communist Party is strong precisely because it has the support of the masses, and the Cultural Revolution convincingly proves this.

The article points out that it is precisely those who now say that the CPC is being "destroyed" who are supporting the counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Chinese Communist Party, directing them against the Chinese Communist Party and against the line of the Chinese Communist Party.

Is it surprising that the degenerate elements in the Soviet Union and the Western bourgeoisie pity their defeated friends? It would be strange if the Bolsheviks pitied their enemies.

When refuting the Soviet revisionist leadership's slander that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is "against the Soviet Union, against the Soviet people," the article states: Is it not in the interests of the Soviet people to struggle against opportunism in China? Undoubtedly, it is in the interests of the Soviet people. It is not in the interests of the Soviet "leadership," as can be seen from the Soviet newspapers, because the Soviet leadership fears that the Chinese Communist Party members and the working class will "infect" the Soviet working class and all laboring people with the desire to struggle against opportunism and degeneration. This is why it is not in the interests of the Soviet leadership, because it itself, since the Khrushchev period, has been a degenerate leadership, pursuing an opportunist line, and is thus a base for all similar Yugoslav revisionists or opportunist factions in China, an obstacle to the world revolutionary movement, and a parasite on the Soviet working class and peasantry. This is the reason for the large number of lies and slanders created by the Soviet official propaganda apparatus against the CPC and its leaders.

The article states that the "special methods" of the Soviet propaganda apparatus are noteworthy. This "special method" is manifested in the fact that it does not mention the fundamental, principled differences between the CPC and the CPSU, thus achieving the basic goal of the Soviet "politicians": deceiving the laboring people of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, deceiving communists all over the world.

The Soviet "politicians" clearly know that if the Soviet laboring people analyze the differences, then they will inevitably expose themselves, inevitably leading to the idea that they must struggle against the degenerate elements in high positions in the Soviet Union, and they are afraid of this.

The leaders and participants of the Cultural Revolution are only against the degenerate elements in the Soviet Union—the Soviet upper leadership are these elements—not against the Soviet people.

Undoubtedly, the struggle against degenerate elements advocated by the Cultural Revolution is in the interests of the Soviet people. Therefore, it is precisely those who create the "accusations" that we have exposed as deceiving people who are against the Soviet people, against the party founded by Lenin and Stalin, and against the revolution.

The article concludes by pointing out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a necessary movement against opportunism and degeneration.

This revolution is carried out by the masses themselves under the leadership of Chinese Bolsheviks, that is, in a truly Leninist manner. This method is fundamentally opposed to the method of backroom, upper-level politics without mass participation (to deceive the masses), which is used by all traitors, including Soviet "politicians."

The Cultural Revolution in China has set a brilliant example of struggling against degeneration, against the restoration of capitalism through the elimination of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the establishment of the rule of a small handful of revisionists.

All the accusations of the Soviet revisionist politicians against the Cultural Revolution are lies, aimed at deceiving the working class of the Soviet Union and the world.

The vicious anti-China movement shows that the degenerate elements in the Soviet Union fear losing their privileges and power, that they fear their own people, uniting them with the most reactionary groups of world capitalism, showing that their interests are the same.

The Soviet revisionists' anti-China movement exposes the initiators themselves, proving that it is urgent to overthrow the power of the Soviet degenerate elements (new bourgeois elements), that is, proving that a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be carried out in the Soviet Union.

    苏联一个反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的“斯大林小组”
    热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命
    痛斥苏修复辟资本主义和猖狂反华的罪行
    新华社十二日讯　苏联的一个反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的革命组织“斯大林小组”最近散发一篇题为《文化革命的真相》的文章，极其热烈地赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，痛斥苏修叛徒集团在苏联复辟资本主义和无耻诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶行径，表现了苏联无产阶级的英雄气概和进行无产阶级革命的决心。
    文章说，无产阶级专政的时代是进行顽强的、尖锐的阶级斗争——无产阶级和资产阶级之间两条道路斗争的时代。复辟和反复辟的斗争，是无产阶级专政的整个历史时期内、从资本主义向共产主义过渡的时期内阶级斗争的主要内容。
    文章指出，在一个社会主义国家里，发生资本主义复辟的道路有三条：
    第一、在社会主义取得胜利以前，被推翻的、但是还没有被消灭的剥削阶级仍然有可能重新取得政权。
    第二、复辟可能由于帝国主义侵略的结果而出现。
    第三、通过和平演变的途径。
    同头两条复辟道路作斗争，要容易得多，因为在这两种场合，我们面临的是完全确定的、可以明确看到的敌人；我们准确地知道打击的方向。而和平演变则是另外一回事。这是最危险、最阴险的道路。
    和平演变之所以对工人阶级、对全体劳动人民特别危险，是由于：
    一、因为我们对付的是伪装起来的敌人，他们隐藏在我们队伍里，用我们的口号掩饰自己，因而要发现这些敌人是极端困难的。
    二、因为对和平演变的威胁一般总是估计不足的。
    文章说，和平演变就是：由于党政领导蜕化变质的结果而使社会主义国家和共产党的性质和实质逐渐发生变化。和平演变的最终结果是复辟资本主义。
    文章在谈到社会主义国家存在着和平演变危险的原因时指出，如果说，无产阶级可以在历史上比较短的期间里从政治上和经济上压倒资产阶级的话，那么，在意识形态方面的斗争则将经历很长很长的时期。因为它涉及人们的活的灵魂。社会主义的新思想、新风尚、新习惯远不是在政治、经济发生变化以后马上就可以占据统治地位的；要做到这一点，需要相当长的时期，而如果谈到取得彻底胜利的话，尤其是如此。此外，这里还得加上资本主义包围的腐蚀性影响。这种同我们敌对的意识形态滋生着无原则性、反共主义、资产阶级个人主义、私有制心理、发财欲、民族主义、沙文主义、世界主义、资产阶级道德，等等。由于这种意识形态在我们这些国家的影响，结果是，使我们的人蜕化变质和资产阶级化。简单地说来，在我们的社会里以及在其他社会主义国家，沾染资产阶级思想者，大有人在：蜕化变质分子、野心家、“共产主义的”官僚、官僚主义者、只关心个人兴旺的人、贪财者、赤裸裸的反社会主义的敌对分子。这些家伙不可避免地钻到党内（包括领导机关内），这首先是因为党是执政的。这些人在客观上是国内资产阶级分子、剥削阶级的残余和国际帝国主义的代理人。如果不消除他们的危害性，那么，到一定的时候，就会形成他们篡夺党和国家的权力的可能性。
    文章指出，钻进党内的资产阶级和国际帝国主义的代理人只能通过取消马克思列宁主义的领导这个途径才能夺取政权。
    文章用赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺苏联党和国家的大权为例，说明了这一点。文章说，赫鲁晓夫及其同伙篡夺政权是从约·维·斯大林逝世开始的。斯大林逝世后，蜕化变质分子在党内和国内展开了十分猖狂的夺权斗争。他们看到终于有可能夺取政权时，便力图用诋毁马克思列宁主义核心的办法将其排挤出领导之外。正是为了达到这个目的，他们提出了所谓“个人迷信”的神话。这一神话的目的是颠覆和继之排除我们党的布尔什维克核心，为用新的路线——蜕化变质的、修正主义路线取代列宁—斯大林的无产阶级路线创造条件。
    文章说，修正主义分子篡夺政权的阴谋活动以及和平演变是从意识形态、从文化、从制造和准备社会舆论开始的。
    他们从三个方面“进行工作”：
    一、所谓“同过去的错误作斗争”——摒弃“旧的”意识形态（马克思列宁主义）。
    二、所谓“创造性地发展马克思列宁主义”——创造“新的”意识形态。
    三、在文学、艺术和日常生活中培植资产阶级意识形态——使工人阶级和全体劳动人民脱离政治，培养贪财和追求个人利益的贪欲。
    简单地说来，他们是从用资产阶级的意识形态取代无产阶级的意识形态开始的。
    我们在详尽地探讨了资本主义复辟的可能性问题以后断定：在确立和巩固新制度以后，社会主义国家中的主要危险是和平演变；和平演变是由篡夺了党和国家领导权的蜕化变质分子和劳动人民的敌人来实现的；修正主义分子篡夺政权与和平演变是从意识形态、从文化、从制造和准备社会舆论开始的。
    文章说，修正主义分子在第一个社会主义国家苏联和一系列其他国家篡夺政权以后，同修正主义叛徒集团斗争等问题特别尖锐地摆在国际无产阶级和共产主义运动的面前。
    文章着重说，毛泽东同志提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论对这些问题作出了回答。
    文章在谈到毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论的基本论点时指出：
    无产阶级文化大革命是对资产阶级及其在思想战线上的代理人的坚决进攻，其使命是：除了在政治上和经济上摧毁资产阶级外，还要在思想上摧毁它。
    无产阶级文化大革命的战略目的是消除资本主义复辟的威胁、消除社会主义国家和平演变的可能性、保卫和巩固无产阶级专政。
    无产阶级文化大革命面临的这些任务，或者换句话说，达到战略目的的具体途径，可以归结如下：
    揭露、严厉批判和孤立钻进党内的蜕化变质分子和野心家；清除党内的侥幸入党的和消极的分子；
    建立没有官僚制度、最大限度地接近人民的国家机构和党的机构；
    肃清意识形态和文化领域中的资产阶级思潮，向资产阶级思想、风俗和习惯宣战，不让这些思想、习俗从国外传来，促使我们的无产阶级思想和文化进一步繁荣和发展，随时随地宣传和传播马克思列宁主义；
    最大限度地发挥广大人民群众的政治积极性，吸收群众决定性地系统地参加各项国家事务；
    在这一斗争的过程中培养新的一代钢铁般坚定的共产党人，教育青年继续进行革命。
    怎样实现这些任务？用什么方法可以完成这些任务？这个方法、无产阶级文化大革命的方法就是群众路线。
    这一革命唤起和发动了极为广泛的人民群众，它向人民表明，政治并不象修正主义者和蜕化变质分子所竭力灌输的那样仅仅是领导人的事，而且是人民的事——是直接同他们有关的头等大事。这一革命表明，能最好、最彻底地揭露蜕化变质分子、野心家、人民的敌人的正是群众，正是应该由群众来判断，领导人里谁坏，谁好，谁是朋友，谁是工人阶级和全体劳动人民的敌人。简单说来，只有布尔什维克领导的群众才能连根拔除和消灭资产阶级路线，只有依靠群众，只有通过群众的行动才能贯彻执行无产阶级文化大革命的宏伟任务，实现其目的——防止资本主义复辟。
    无产阶级文化大革命是十月革命普遍道路的继续和发展，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的必然结果。一切无产阶级专政的国家都必不可免地要经过社会主义革命的这一阶段。
    简单说来，在阶级内容方面一致，而在民族形式方面不同的无产阶级文化大革命是马克思列宁主义的普遍规律。
    文章接着揭露和谴责苏修领导集团千方百计歪曲中国的真实情况和诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的罪行。
    文章说，苏联人民想要知道中国事态的真相。但是，苏联的官方宣传千方百计地歪曲中国的真实情况，为此使用了一切手段。在这一诽谤运动中，苏联报刊同等地使用“自己的”材料和资产阶级通讯社的材料，这个事实本身就说明，苏联宣传机构和资产阶级宣传机构的利益是一致的。不但如此，资产阶级报刊的“报道”看来比《真理报》和其他官方机关报刊上的肆无忌惮的文章还“虚心些”和“客观些”。正因为如此，资产阶级宣传机构说：苏联为它们的目的提供了最好的材料！而这的确是人民中国、中国共产党、无产阶级文化大革命的敌人所散播的一切反华诽谤的“最好”、最完整和最系统的汇集。正是这样，就使揭露这一反华诽谤成为所有忠于列宁和斯大林的人，所有愿意同蜕化变质行为作斗争的人的迫切和必要的任务。
    文章指出，一切斗争都是为了政权而斗争的。谁也不能否认，全党、全体中国人民参加了这场斗争，这是劳动群众的斗争。这就是说，中国的文化革命不是个人的争吵，而是原则性斗争，是为全党、全体人民的利益进行斗争。
    文化革命是以毛泽东为首的中国布尔什维克反对党的机会主义派的原则性斗争。
    这场斗争是中共同赫鲁晓夫式的修正主义分子长期斗争的合乎逻辑的继续和结果。苏修政客们散布谣言，说什么群众在中共布尔什维克核心领导下向机会主义分子夺权是集团之间的无原则斗争，这种谣言败坏中国人民和中国共产党的斗争的名声，从而支持中国人民和中国共产党的敌人。这地地道道是反华、反共宣传。
    文章在揭露苏修胡说什么“中国的工人阶级不支持文化革命”和对中国青年的诽谤时说，中国工人把管理企业的工作掌握在自己手里，工人是新的党和国家领导机关的骨干，工人是文化革命的先进队伍，这些事实本身就驳倒了这种恶毒的捏造。
    中国青年参加文化大革命，对青年本身来说也是很重要的，青年们经过了文化革命熔炉的战斗锻炼。这种锻炼赋予青年以实际斗争的宝贵经验，从而加强了他们的共产主义精神，这是造就要接老一辈中国布尔什维克的班的新的一代战士的最好方法。这种锻炼使党有了青年人这样的可靠的和取之不竭的后备力量。
    文章在揭露苏修对中国人民解放军的污蔑时指出，中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中的确起着伟大作用。文章说：什么是中国人民解放军？这就是工人和农民，就是中国人民——不过是武装起来的人民。人民解放军不仅是武装起来的一部分工农，而且也是最有纪律的、最有素养的、最有思想的那一部分工农。
    文章还驳斥了苏修散布的所谓中国无产阶级文化大革命“是针对中国共产党的”这种谰言。
    文章说，最广大的人民群众同党一道参加文化革命，这丝毫不会破坏中国共产党的威信，因为这些群众完全是在党的领导下和按照党的指示行动的。人民群众参加对资产阶级蜕化变质和机会主义的斗争，这只能使他们布尔什维克化，使他们团结在党的马克思主义核心的周围，教育他们具有共产主义和革命实践的精神，也就是使他们变成党的强大的后备力量。
    群众在毛泽东的党领导下，为党的事业积极奋斗，这证明了中国共产党的成熟，证明了中国党的政策是正确的，证明了中国党和人民的伟大团结。中国共产党之所以强大，就是因为它有群众的支持，文化革命令人信服地证明了这一点。
    文章指出，正是那些现在胡说中共在被“搞垮”的人在支持中国共产党内的反革命修正主义分子，指使他们反对中国共产党，反对中国共产党的路线。
    苏联的蜕化变质分子和西方资产阶级怜悯自己被打垮的朋友，这又有什么可惊奇的呢？
    要是布尔什维克怜悯自己的敌人，这才是奇怪的事。
    文章在驳斥苏修领导集团诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命“是反对苏联、反对苏联人民”时说，在中国同机会主义进行斗争难道不是对苏联人民有利吗？毫无疑问，这对苏联人民是有利的。这对苏联“领导”是不利的，从苏联的报纸上就可以判断这一点，因为苏联领导唯恐中国共产党员和工人阶级把同机会主义和蜕化变质斗争的愿望“传染给”苏联工人阶级和全体劳动人民。这之所以对苏联领导不利，是因为它本身从赫鲁晓夫时期起，就是蜕化变质的领导，它奉行机会主义路线，从而是一切类似南斯拉夫修正主义者或者中国反对派的机会主义分子的基地，是阻碍世界革命运动的障碍物，是苏联工人阶级和劳动农民身上的寄生瘤。这就是苏联官方宣传机构对中共及其领导人制造大量谎言和诽谤的原因。
    文章说，苏联宣传机构的“特殊方法”是值得注意的。这一“特殊方法”表现在，闭口不提中共同苏共之间的基本的、原则的分歧，这样来达到苏联“政客”的基本目的：欺骗苏联和社会主义国家的劳动人民，欺骗全世界的共产党人。
    苏联“政治家”清楚地知道，如果让苏联劳动人民分析分歧，那么，就不可避免地会暴露他们自己，就不可避免地会引起必须同苏联身居高位的蜕化变质分子作斗争的想法，他们也就是怕这个。
    文化革命的领导人和参加者只是反对苏联的蜕化变质分子——苏联的上层领导人就是这些分子——而不是反对苏联人民。
    毫无疑问，文化革命所号召的同蜕化变质分子作斗争，这符合苏联人民的利益。因此，正是那些被我们所揭露的欺骗人的“指责”的制造者，才是在反对苏联人民，反对列宁斯大林缔造的党，反对革命。
    文章最后指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是反对机会主义和蜕化变质的一场必要的运动。
    这场革命是在中国布尔什维克的领导下由群众自己进行的，即是以真正的列宁主义的方式进行的。这一方法是同没有群众参加（为了欺骗群众）的幕后的上层政治的方法是根本对立的，而幕后上层政治方法却是一切叛徒，其中包括苏联“政治家”在内，所采用的。
    中国的文化革命树立了同蜕化变质，同通过消灭无产阶级专政和建立一小撮的修正主义分子统治而实现资本主义复辟的现象进行斗争的光辉典范。
    苏修政客对文化革命的一切指责都是骗人的，他们的目的是为了欺骗苏联和全世界的工人阶级。
    恶毒的反华运动说明了苏联的蜕化变质分子害怕丧失自己的特权和政权，说明他们害怕本国人民，这一运动把他们同世界资本主义的最反动的集团联合在一起，表明他们之间的利益是一致的。
    苏修的反华运动暴露了发起者自己，它证明，迫切需要推翻苏联蜕化变质分子（新资产阶级分子）的政权，也就是证明，必须在苏联进行一场无产阶级文化革命。
