In the wake of the Palestinian guerrillas' series of attacks in the Israeli-occupied areas, achieving one victory after another, the anxious Israeli occupation authorities are escalating their brutal suppression and fascist bloodbath against the Arabs. However, the Arabs, undaunted by the violence, are rising up in resistance, dealing heavy blows to the Israeli invaders.

Reports indicate that the Israeli aggressors have adopted savage policies of mass expulsion and isolation against the Arabs in occupied cities like Jerusalem. On April 18, Israel brazenly announced the seizure of land inhabited by Arabs in Jerusalem, forcing over 600 Arab households to leave their homes and become refugees. The Israeli occupation authorities are also planning to build 2,500 "residential areas" outside the city, forcing the city's Arabs to relocate, thereby isolating the Arabs inside and outside the city. Reports also indicate that the Syrian Golan Heights, occupied by Israel, have turned into a "dead city," with hardly any Arab households remaining.

Within the occupied areas, the Israeli aggressors are forcing Arabs to accept the Israeli "domestic" education system, making Hebrew the official language, and re-examining all textbooks to remove any content opposing Israel. Simultaneously, the Israeli occupation authorities have ordered the prohibition of teaching Arab history in schools.

The Arabs in the occupied areas have been designated as "second-class citizens" by the Israeli fascist regime. The Israeli aggressors can arbitrarily confiscate the property of Arabs, and Arab merchants must pay taxes three times higher than before.

For those Arabs who support and sympathize with the Palestinian guerrillas, the Israeli aggressors are even more ruthless in their persecution. Reports indicate that if an Arab resident offers a drink of water to a guerrilla, the aggressors will destroy his house; if a friend of his joins the guerrillas, he will be tortured, even "disfigured."

The Israeli aggressors can arbitrarily arrest Arab residents. In early March, in Nablus alone, 100 people were arrested and 400 were interrogated; by the end of March, 500 people were arrested in Hebron. According to official figures from Tel Aviv, which are obviously understated, since last September, 1,500 people have been arrested, with 90 already brutally killed.

For the imprisoned patriots, the brutal Israeli aggressors torture them with severe beatings and cruel punishments, causing countless patriots to die from torture.

As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "All the oppression inflicted on the revolutionary people by the reactionaries of various countries will, in the end, only serve to promote more extensive and more violent revolutions." In the face of the brutal persecution by the Israeli fascist authorities, the people in the Israeli-occupied areas are rising up in resistance. In Jerusalem, out of 13,000 Arab workers, the vast majority refused to work as a form of protest. Many residents, risking their lives, support the activities of the guerrillas. Reports indicate that in refugee camps in some Arab countries and within the Israeli-occupied areas, large batches of Arab youths are constantly applying to join the guerrillas. They fight bravely in the occupied areas, dealing heavy blows to the Israeli invaders. Many young Arab women have also joined the guerrillas, and the guerrillas have begun training female soldiers, who are preparing to join the fight. Some young children not only enthusiastically visit the victorious guerrilla fighters everywhere but also directly participate in the battles. In mid-April, in Jerusalem, children aged 15 or 16 distributed leaflets, calling on the people to rise up against Israeli aggression.

The fascist rule of the Israeli invaders also faces opposition from Israelis. Recently, in Jerusalem, Israeli students and teachers held a protest march against the authorities' arrest and interrogation of Arab student leaders. Within the Israeli army, some soldiers and officers who sympathize with the Arabs also oppose Israel's reactionary policies. Reports indicate that in early April, Israel's secret court tried 11 Israeli officers and 25 soldiers, some of whom were tried for refusing to carry out orders to arrest Arabs.

　　以色列占领当局的残暴镇压只能激起强烈反抗
　　阿拉伯人民不畏强暴奋起斗争沉重打击侵略者
    新华社讯　在巴勒斯坦游击队在以色列占领区内发动一系列袭击而取得一个又一个胜利的情况下，惶惶不安的以色列占领当局正在变本加厉地对阿拉伯人进行残暴的镇压和法西斯的血腥统治。但是，阿拉伯人不畏强暴，奋起反抗，给以色列侵略者以更沉重的打击。
    据报道，以色列侵略者对占领区内的耶路撒冷等城市的阿拉伯人，野蛮地采取大量驱逐和隔离的政策。四月十八日，以色列悍然宣布征用耶路撒冷城内阿拉伯人居住的土地，迫使六百多户阿拉伯居民背井离乡，流离失所。以色列占领当局还准备在城外建筑二千五百个“居民区”，强迫城内的阿拉伯人迁往城外，把城内外的阿拉伯人隔离开来。据报道，被以色列侵占的叙利亚戈兰高地的库奈特拉城，现在成了一座“死城”，已经没有几户阿拉伯人了。
    在占领区内，以色列侵略者用高压手段强迫阿拉伯人接受以色列“国内”的教育制度，把希伯莱语作为官方语言，并重新“审查”所有的教科书，以便把教科书上反对以色列的内容统统删掉。同时，以色列占领当局还下令禁止在学校里讲授阿拉伯人的历史。
    在占领区内的阿拉伯人，已经被以色列法西斯政权列为“第二等居民”，以色列侵略者可以任意没收阿拉伯人的财产，阿拉伯的商人必须向以色列缴纳比过去高三倍的赋税。
    对于那些支持和同情巴勒斯坦游击队的阿拉伯人，以色列侵略者更是肆意迫害。据报道，阿拉伯居民只要给游击队员喝过一口水，侵略者就毁掉他家的房子；只要他的朋友参加了游击队，他就要受到拷打，甚至被“毁容”。
    以色列侵略者对阿拉伯居民可以任意横加逮捕。三月初，在纳布卢斯一次就逮捕了一百人，审讯了四百人；三月底，在希布伦逮捕了五百人。据特拉维夫官方透露的显然是缩小了的数字承认，从去年九月以来，已经逮捕了一千五百人，其中九十人已惨遭杀害。
    对被囚禁的爱国者，暴虐成性的以色列侵略者对他们严刑拷打，施加酷刑，无数的爱国者活活地被磨折死去。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。在以色列法西斯当局残酷迫害面前，以色列占领区人民奋起反抗。在耶路撒冷，总数达一万三千名阿拉伯工人中，绝大多数工人拒绝上工，以示抗议。许多居民冒着生命危险支持游击队的活动。据报道，在一些阿拉伯国家的难民营和以色列占领区内，经常不断地有大批阿拉伯青年申请参加游击队。他们在占领区内，奋勇作战，狠狠地打击了以色列侵略者。不少阿拉伯年轻妇女也参加了游击队，现在游击队已经开始训练女战士，她们拿起武器，准备参加战斗。一些少年儿童不但到处热情地慰问打了胜仗的游击战士，有的还直接参加了战斗。四月中旬，在耶路撒冷市，就有十五、六岁的孩子散发传单，号召人民起来反对以色列侵略。
    以色列侵略者的法西斯统治，也遭到以色列人的反对。不久前，在耶路撒冷市，就爆发了以色列学生和教师抗议当局逮捕审讯阿拉伯学生领袖的示威游行。在以色列军队内一些同情阿拉伯人的士兵和军官，也反对以色列的反动政策。据报道，四月初，以色列的秘密法庭就审讯了十一个以色列军官和二十五个士兵，其中一些军官和士兵是因为拒绝执行逮捕阿拉伯人的命令而受审的。
