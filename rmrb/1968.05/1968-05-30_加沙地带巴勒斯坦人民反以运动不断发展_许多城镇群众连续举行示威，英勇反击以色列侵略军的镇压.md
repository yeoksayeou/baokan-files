Many townspeople have held continuous demonstrations, bravely counterattacking the Israeli aggressor troops' suppression.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Cairo on the 27th, local newspapers reported that on the 26th, Palestinians in many towns in the Gaza Strip continued to hold demonstrations against Israeli occupation. The mass demonstrations that began on the 23rd have lasted for four days and have spread from the northern Gaza City to the southern Khan Yunis.

The report said that on the 26th in Gaza City, the crowd attacked the headquarters of the Israeli "military governor" and threw stones at Israeli patrols and military vehicles. They set up barricades on the streets, cutting off traffic. The demonstrators bravely counterattacked the Israeli aggressor troops that came to suppress them, injuring some enemy soldiers and smashing some of their vehicles.

Hundreds of Palestinian students set up barricades on the road from Gaza to Deir al-Balah using stones and threw stones at Israeli vehicles. They shouted slogans such as "Israel, get out!" The Israeli aggressor troops ruthlessly opened fire on the demonstrating students, injuring five female students and arresting several people, including primary school students.

The powerful anti-Israeli demonstrations in the Gaza Strip erupted after the Israeli occupation authorities, under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, conducted mass arrests of local Palestinian residents. On the 23rd, several hundred Palestinian women went to the headquarters of the Israeli "military governor" to protest. Following this, on the 25th, another 400 women took to the streets to demonstrate. They advanced towards the headquarters of the "military governor" in Gaza City, but were stopped about 200 meters from the building. The demonstrators built barricades with empty boxes and threw stones at the Israeli occupation troops, holding out for several hours.

Currently, the anti-Israeli movement of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is developing. Students continue to boycott classes.

    加沙地带巴勒斯坦人民反以运动不断发展
    许多城镇群众连续举行示威，英勇反击以色列侵略军的镇压
    据新华社开罗二十七日电　据此间报纸报道，加沙地带许多城镇的巴勒斯坦人二十六日继续举行示威，反对以色列占领，这次从二十三日开始的群众示威，已经持续了四天，并已由北面的加沙市蔓延到南面的汗尤尼斯。
    报道说，二十六日在加沙市，群众袭击了加沙以色列“军事长官”总部，并且向以色列巡逻队和军车投掷石头。他们在大街上设置路障，断绝了交通。示威群众英勇反击赶来镇压的以色列侵略军，打伤一些敌军，还砸了一些敌军的车辆。
    数百名巴勒斯坦学生在加沙通往德尔巴拉的公路上，用石头垒起路障，并向以色列的车辆扔石头。他们高呼“以色列滚出去！”等口号。以色列侵略军悍然向示威学生开枪，打伤了五名女学生，还逮捕了一些人，其中有小学生。
    加沙地带的强大反以示威，是在以色列占领当局借口搜查游击队对当地巴勒斯坦居民进行大逮捕后爆发的。二十三日，加沙市有几百名巴勒斯坦妇女前往以色列“军事长官”总部提出抗议。接着在二十五日，又有四百名妇女上街示威。她们向加沙市的“军事长官”总部前进，但在离建筑物两百米的地方被阻挡住了。示威者用空箱子筑起路障，向以色列占领军扔石头，坚持了好几个小时。
    目前，加沙地带巴勒斯坦人民反以运动正在发展。学生继续罢课。
