A soldier named Bali from Cameroon recently gave a speech, warmly celebrating the second anniversary of the issuance of the great historical document, the CPC Central Committee's "Notice" of May 16, 1966.

Bali said, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the "Notice" is a document of great significance in Marxism-Leninism. This document creatively develops Marxism-Leninism, elucidates the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and solves the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Bali said, over the past two years, the brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution have proven that Chairman Mao's scientific judgments in this great historical document are so wise! "The great victory of this cultural revolution has made China an invincible and great base for the world revolution. This cultural revolution, in the political and ideological realms, has created extremely favorable conditions for accelerating the collapse of imperialism, old and new colonialism, and revisionism, and for the victory of socialism worldwide."

Bali, with deep feelings for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized: "Mao Zedong Thought is a guiding light, illuminating the great path of the world revolution, illuminating the path of the Cultural Revolution, and illuminating the path of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat." He said, Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the working class, which has already seized power, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is the guarantee for the transition from socialism to communism. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental criterion for distinguishing between revolution and non-revolution.

He finally said: "Experience has shown us that the revolution in Cameroon will achieve final victory only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. We should learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in our struggle. As long as we persist in the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely achieve final victory."

He shouted: "Long live the Cultural Revolution! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

    喀麦隆一战士热烈欢呼中共中央《通知》发表两周年
    坚持走毛主席指引的道路，革命一定胜利
    新华社十六日讯　一位名叫巴利的喀麦隆战士最近发表谈话，热烈欢呼伟大的历史文件中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    巴利说，在毛主席亲自主持下制定的《通知》，是一个意义重大的马克思列宁主义文献。这个文献创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，阐明了中国无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，解决了无产阶级专政下继续革命的问题。
    巴利说，两年来，无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，证明了毛主席在这个伟大的历史文件中所作出的科学论断是多么英明！“这场文化革命的伟大胜利使中国成为世界革命坚不可摧的、伟大的根据地。这场文化革命在政治和意识形态方面为加速帝国主义、新老殖民主义和修正主义的崩溃，为社会主义在全世界取得胜利，创造了极其有利的条件。”
    巴利怀着对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的深厚感情强调指出：“毛泽东思想是一盏指路明灯，照亮了伟大的世界革命的道路，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路，照亮了巩固无产阶级专政的道路。”他说，毛泽东思想是已经取得政权的工人阶级巩固无产阶级专政的根本保证，是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的保证。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。对待毛泽东思想的态度是区分革命和不革命的根本标准。
    他最后说：“经验向我们表明，喀麦隆革命要取得最后胜利，就必须依靠毛泽东思想。我们应该在我们的斗争中学习和运用毛泽东思想。只要我们坚持走毛主席所指引的道路，我们就一定会赢得最后胜利。”
    他高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
