Thousands of Turkish students, writers, professors, and women held a massive anti-American demonstration in the capital, Ankara, on April 29, strongly demanding that Turkey withdraw from the North Atlantic Aggression Group and furiously condemning the criminal activities of American imperialism in Turkey.

The demonstrators continuously shouted slogans such as "The Americans are the worst scoundrels!" "Americans, go back!" "We want an independent Turkey!"

This demonstration was organized to commemorate the anti-Menderes dictatorship demonstration by Turkish students eight years ago, during which the students were brutally suppressed.

On April 29, the demonstrators spoke on the streets, furiously condemning American imperialism and the North Atlantic Aggression Group it controls, and strongly demanding that Turkey withdraw from this group. The demonstrators exposed the criminal activities of the large number of Americans in Turkey. This demonstration caused traffic in the center of Ankara to come to a standstill for several hours.

Faced with the powerful anti-American demonstration, the Turkish authorities revealed their ferocity, dispatching a large number of military and police to brutally suppress the demonstrators. According to reports, in this suppression, 20 demonstrating students were injured, and 50 were arrested.

Compared to the anti-American demonstration held in Ankara in January this year, this anti-American demonstration was larger in scale, reflecting that the Turkish people's dissatisfaction with American imperialism is growing. In the January anti-American demonstration, about 1,000 capital students firmly stated while distributing pamphlets that they would launch a "large-scale protest movement until Turkey withdraws from the American imperialist tool—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

American imperialism pulled Turkey into the North Atlantic Aggression Group in 1952 and, through bilateral military agreements signed with Turkey, established more than 120 military bases in Turkey, turning Turkey into the main base for American aggression in the Middle East. American imperialism also stationed more than 10,000 troops in Turkey and sent a large number of American "experts" and "advisors" to infiltrate various military institutions and government departments in Turkey, strengthening its control over Turkey and causing the Turkish people to suffer extremely serious disasters.

　　土耳其数千群众举行大规模反美示威
　　土耳其当局在强大反美示威面前凶相毕露竟出动大批军警进行残酷镇压
    新华社一日讯　安卡拉消息：数千名土耳其学生、作家、教授和妇女四月二十九日在首都安卡拉举行规模盛大的反美示威，强烈要求土耳其退出北大西洋侵略集团，愤怒谴责美帝国主义在土耳其为非作歹的罪恶活动。
    示威群众不断愤怒高呼“美国混蛋透顶！”“美国佬，滚回去！”“要独立的土耳其！”等口号。
    这次示威是为纪念八年前土耳其学生举行反对曼德列斯独裁政府的示威斗争而组织的，在那次示威中，学生们遭到了血腥的镇压。
    四月二十九日，示威者在街头发表演说，愤怒谴责美帝国主义和它控制的北大西洋侵略集团，并强烈要求土耳其退出这个集团。示威者揭露在土耳其出现的大批美国佬为非作歹的罪恶活动。这次示威使安卡拉市中心的交通停顿了好几个小时。
    土耳其当局在强大的反美示威面前凶相毕露，竟出动大批军警对示威群众进行残酷镇压。据报道，在这次镇压中，有二十名示威学生被打伤，五十人被捕。
    同今年一月间在安卡拉举行的反美示威相比较，这次反美示威比以前的规模要大，这反映了土耳其人民对美帝国主义的不满情绪正在不断增长。在一月间的反美示威中，约一千名首都学生在散发小册子时坚决表示，要开展“大规模的抗议运动，直到土耳其退出美帝国主义的工具——北大西洋公约组织为止”。
    美帝国主义在一九五二年把土耳其拉进北大西洋侵略集团，并通过同土耳其签订的双边军事协定，在土耳其建立了一百二十多个军事基地，把土耳其变成美国侵略中东的主要基地。美帝国主义还在土耳其驻扎了一万多名军队，并派遣大量美国“专家”、“顾问”渗入到土耳其各军事机构和政府各部门中去，加强对土耳其的控制，使土耳其人民遭受极其严重的灾难。
