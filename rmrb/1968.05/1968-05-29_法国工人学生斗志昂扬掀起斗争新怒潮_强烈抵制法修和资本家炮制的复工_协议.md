More than ten million French workers have defied the "agreement" reached between the French revisionist clique and the yellow union leaders with the French monopoly capitalists, and are continuing their nationwide strike with high morale. French workers and students, undeterred by the deception and suppression of the French ruling clique, have launched a new wave of struggle across the country.

The "agreement" for resumption of work, reached on the morning of May 27 between the French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, and other yellow union leaders with the French government and monopoly capitalists, has been strongly resisted by French workers nationwide and universally condemned by the French people.

Two members of the Political Bureau of the French revisionist traitor clique—the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Seguy, and the Chairman of the Confederation, Frachon—personally went to the Renault automobile factory in Boulogne-Billancourt, a suburb of Paris, to peddle this agreement that betrays the interests of the workers, attempting to lure the workers back to work. Tens of thousands of workers occupying the factory were extremely indignant at the treacherous actions of these two traitors and jeered at them. In the past two days, other leaders of the French revisionists and yellow unions, who have been frantically active in various large industrial and mining enterprises across France to lure workers back to work to serve the monopoly capitalists, have also met with the same shameful fate as Seguy and Frachon.

In addition to the Renault automobile company, other major French enterprises such as the Citroën automobile factory, Berliet truck factory, Sud Aviation aircraft factory, Rhodia-Seta chemical fiber factory, have all held workers' meetings and decided to continue the strike and occupy the factories. The railways, airports, and seaports in France are still on strike. Workers in Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Metz, Montpellier, Mulhouse, and many other industrial centers in France have all condemned the treacherous actions of the yellow unions and decided to continue the struggle. Agence France-Presse exclaimed that French workers have not only "not resumed work" but have "intensified their strike movement."

On May 27, a large number of French workers announced a strike, further strengthening the strike movement. At the Cadarache nuclear research center near Marseille, employees decided to go on strike and occupy this important research center. More than a thousand technicians at the Bouloie power plant occupied power plants in Paris and various provinces and went on strike on May 28. Sailors stopped transportation on the Seine River, Oise River, and Lorraine Canal.

In the French colony of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, dock workers, sugar mill workers went on strike, teachers stopped teaching, and students stopped attending classes to support the just struggle of French workers and students.

On May 27, more than fifty thousand students and workers in Paris, defying the government's ban, held another massive demonstration and rally in the French capital. This rally and demonstration were initiated and organized by Paris students, and the French revisionist traitor clique and the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, repeatedly opposed and prohibited workers from participating in this demonstration. To sabotage this demonstration, the French revisionists also held meetings in seventeen squares in Paris at the same time to promote the agreement for resumption of work. However, a large number of Paris workers did not heed the "orders" of the French revisionists and participated in the demonstration, fighting side by side with the students. Despite the rain, students and workers waved red flags, sang the "Internationale," and marched through the city from the southern part of Paris. The banners held high by the demonstrators read: "Worker Power," "Seguy is a traitor."

After the march, more than fifty thousand students and workers held a meeting at the Charléty Stadium. To express support for this demonstration, workers in a large factory opposite the stadium hung a huge banner that read: "Workers and students unite." The treacherous actions of the French revisionists against the revolutionary people were condemned at the meeting. Speakers emphasized that workers and students must unite and continue the struggle.

Paris students are very indignant about the actions of the French revisionists and other yellow union leaders in sabotaging the struggle of workers and students. The students pointed out bluntly that the so-called agreement for resumption of work is a naked "betrayal." They also angrily said, "Students did not build barricades on the streets of Paris for a few new school buildings, and we do not believe that the young workers who fought alongside us did so for a seven percent wage increase."

On May 27, workers and students in various parts of France also launched a new wave of struggle. In Toulouse, thirty-five thousand workers and students held a demonstration and march, declaring their struggle for a new society free from capitalist oppression. In the western French port city of Nantes, thirty thousand workers held a demonstration and march and decided to continue the struggle. In the port of Saint-Nazaire, twenty-five thousand workers made the same decision after a meeting. In Brest, twelve thousand people held a protest meeting. In Angers, ten thousand people demonstrated. In Marseille, Clermont-Ferrand, Nice, Poitiers, Limoges, Belfort, Besançon, Longjumeau, Vezoul, and other places, large-scale mass demonstrations broke out.

In the face of more than ten million workers continuing their strike and massive demonstrations erupting in major cities across the country, French President Charles de Gaulle held an emergency cabinet meeting at the Élysée Palace in the afternoon of May 27. De Gaulle admitted at the meeting that France is "being shaken" and will "experience many more shocks."

After the meeting, the French government announced a decision to hold a public referendum on June 16 on the issue of authorizing De Gaulle to carry out "reforms," and accepted the resignation of French Education Minister Alain Peyrefitte, attempting to ease the anger of workers and students. On the other hand, Minister of the Armed Forces Pierre Messmer and Minister of the Interior Christian Fouchet held an emergency "security meeting." Minister of Information Georges Gorse declared, "The government has taken necessary steps to strengthen the forces maintaining order." Meanwhile, the French authorities conducted large-scale searches in the Latin Quarter of Paris and other major cities, claiming to have "discovered weapons," creating a pretext for further suppression of the people's revolutionary struggle.

However, no matter how hard the French ruling clique tries to play the two tricks of political deception and violent suppression, it cannot hide its flustered and weak appearance.

The revolutionary storm of the French people is increasingly deeply shaking the entire Europe, making the ruling cliques of Western European capitalist countries anxious. A British cabinet minister is very afraid that British workers and students will also rise up in revolt, fearing that the growing "dissatisfaction" of the British people will explode into "violent action" like in France. Some British bourgeois newspapers also admit that "similar situations may occur here." West German bourgeois newspapers are worried that the paralysis of France will continue, leading to the "gradual decline of Western Europe."

    法国工人学生斗志昂扬掀起斗争新怒潮  强烈抵制法修和资本家炮制的复工“协议”
    新华社二十八日讯　巴黎消息：一千多万法国工人蔑视法国修正主义集团和黄色工会头目同垄断资产阶级达成的“协议”，斗志昂扬地继续坚持全国大罢工。法国工人和学生不顾法国统治集团的欺骗和镇压，在全国各地掀起了新的斗争的怒潮。
    法修控制的法国全国总工会和其他黄色工会头目，同法国政府和法国垄断资产阶级在二十七日晨达成的复工“协议”，遭到法国全国工人强烈的抵制，受到法国人民普遍的谴责。
    法修叛徒集团的两个政治局委员——法国全国总工会总书记塞居伊和总工会的主席弗拉商二十七日亲自出马，跑到法国最大的企业——雷诺汽车公司在巴黎郊区的布洛涅—比扬古工厂兜售这个出卖工人利益的“协议”，诱骗工人复工。成千上万占领着这个工厂的工人对这两个工贼的叛卖行径十分气愤，他们冲着这两个家伙发出呸呸声。这两天为了替垄断资产阶级效劳，而在法国各大工矿企业中展开诱骗工人“复工”的狂热活动的法修和别的黄色工会的其他头目，也碰到塞居伊和弗拉商同样可耻的下场。
    除了雷诺汽车公司以外，法国其他几个最大的企业——雪铁龙汽车厂、贝利埃卡车厂、南方飞机公司的飞机制造厂、罗迪亚赛塔化学纤维厂都召开了工人大会，决定继续罢工和占领工厂。法国的铁路、机场、海港仍在坚持罢工。里昂、马赛、图卢兹、梅茨、蒙彼利埃、牟罗兹以及法国其他许多工业中心的广大工人都纷纷谴责黄色工会的叛卖行为，决定坚持斗争。法新社惊呼，法国工人不仅“没有复工”，反而“加强了他们的罢工运动”。
    二十七日又有大批的法国工人宣布罢工，进一步壮大了罢工斗争的队伍。在马赛附近的卡达拉希核研究中心，职工们决定举行罢工，并占领这个重要的研究中心。布尔发电厂的一千多名技术员占领了巴黎和各省的发电厂，并在二十八日举行罢工。船员们停止了塞纳河、瓦兹河、洛林运河等内河上的运输。
    法国在印度洋上的殖民地留尼汪，码头工人、糖厂工人也举行罢工，教师罢教，学生罢课，以支持法国工人和学生的正义斗争。
    巴黎学生、工人五万多人，二十七日不顾法国政府的禁令，在法国首都再次举行了声势浩大的示威游行和集会。这次集会和游行，是巴黎学生倡议和组织的，法修叛徒集团和法修控制的总工会一再反对和禁止工人参加这次示威。为了破坏这次示威，法修还同时在巴黎十七个广场上召开会议，推销复工“协议”。可是，大批的巴黎工人不听法修的“号令”，参加了这次示威，同学生并肩战斗。尽管天在下雨，学生和工人们挥舞着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，从巴黎市南部穿过市区游行。示威者高举的横幅标语上写着：“工人权力”，“塞居伊是工贼”。
    游行后，五万多学生和工人在夏勒蒂运动场举行大会。为了表示支持这次示威，运动场对面的一家大工厂的工人挂出了一条巨大的横幅标语，上面写道：“工人学生团结起来”。法修叛卖革命人民的罪恶行径在大会上遭到学生和工人的谴责。会上发言的人强调，工人和学生要团结起来，斗争要继续下去。
    巴黎学生对于法修和其他黄色工会头目破坏工人和学生斗争的行为十分愤慨。学生们一针见血地指出，所谓复工“协议”是赤裸裸的“叛卖”。他们还愤怒地说：“学生们不是为了得到几栋新校舍而（在巴黎街道上）筑起街垒的，我们也不相信和我们一起斗争的青年工人是为了提高工资百分之七而这样作的。”
    二十七日，法国各地的工人和学生也掀起了新的斗争的浪潮。在图卢兹，三万五千工人和学生举行示威游行，表示要为一个“摆脱资本主义压迫”的新社会而奋斗。在法国西部的大港口南特，三万工人举行了示威游行，并决定坚持斗争。在圣纳泽尔港，二万五千工人在集会后作出同样的决定。在雷斯特，一万二千人举行了抗议大会。在昂热有一万人示威。在马赛、克莱芒—费朗、尼斯、普瓦提埃、里摩日、贝福尔、贝桑松、隆勒索尼埃、维祖尔等地，都爆发了大规模的群众示威。
    在一千多万工人继续坚持罢工，全国各大城市到处爆发声势浩大的示威游行的情况下，法国总统戴高乐二十七日下午再次在爱丽舍宫召开内阁紧急会议。戴高乐在会上承认，法国“正在受到震动”，并且还会“受到其他许多震动”。
    会后，法国政府宣布决定在六月十六日就授权戴高乐进行“改革”问题进行公民投票，并接受法国教育部长佩雷菲特的辞职，妄图以此缓和工人和学生的愤怒。另一方面，武装部队部长梅斯梅尔同内政部长伏歇举行了紧急的“安全会议”。宣传部长戈尔斯扬言，“政府已采取必要的步骤加强维持秩序的力量”。与此同时，法国当局在巴黎大学区和其他一些大城市大肆搜捕，并扬言“发现了武器”，为进一步镇压群众的革命斗争制造借口。
    可是，不管法国统治集团如何加紧玩弄政治欺骗和暴力镇压的两手，毕竟无法掩饰它手忙脚乱、外强中干的窘态。
    法国人民革命的风暴日益深刻地震撼着整个欧洲，使西欧资本主义国家的统治集团惶惶不安。英国的一个内阁大臣十分害怕英国工人、学生也起来造反，担心英国人民日益增强的“不满情绪”会象法国一样，爆发成为“暴力行动”。英国一些资产阶级报纸也承认，“类似（法国）的情况可能在这里发生”。西德的资产阶级报纸担心法国的瘫痪继续下去会引起“西欧的逐渐衰落”。
