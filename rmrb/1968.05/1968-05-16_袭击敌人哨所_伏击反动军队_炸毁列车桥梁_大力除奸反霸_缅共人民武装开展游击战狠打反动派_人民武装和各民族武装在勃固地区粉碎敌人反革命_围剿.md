The armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party, led by the Burmese Communist Party, and the armed forces of various ethnic groups under the National Democratic Front have been active in the Bago, Irrawaddy, Tanintharyi, and Arakan administrative regions, as well as in the vast areas of Upper Burma. They continue to wage guerrilla warfare, striking hard at the Burmese reactionaries.

According to revelations from Burmese reactionary newspapers, the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign launched by the Burmese reactionary government in Bago last autumn has failed. The Burmese Communist Party's armed forces and the armed forces of various ethnic groups have recently been extremely active. According to incomplete statistics, in the one and a half months from late February to early April, they launched nearly twenty attacks.

According to revelations from Burmese reactionary newspapers, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party and various ethnic groups have successively attacked towns occupied by Burmese reactionary military and police forces, raided police stations, and Burmese reactionary government warehouses. On March 3, about thirty members of the National Democratic Front's armed forces attacked the town of Pada in Bago District. In the early hours of March 4, about two hundred members of the Karen people's armed forces, led by the National Democratic Front, attacked and captured a police station in the eastern part of the Sittang River in the town of Sittaung in the East Yebu District of Bago. On March 5, thirty members of the Burmese Communist Party's armed forces attacked a police outpost in a rubber plantation owned by the Burmese reactionary government near Indeg in Bago District and burned down the fertilizer warehouse and other buildings of the rubber plantation. On the nights of March 11 and March 13, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked the town of Bindeiksha in Bago District three times. In late March, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked a police station in the Bemyo District of Bago, seizing all the weapons in the police station. On April 3, fifty members of the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party launched an attack east of Zaygone in the Thayet District.

The armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party have also repeatedly attacked the Yangon-Bemyo railway line. According to revelations from Burmese reactionary newspapers, on February 26, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party blew up an armored train traveling from Bemyo to Yangon with landmines between Padan and Natlin. On March 27, about one hundred and fifty members of the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party launched an attack on the railway line between Bawm and Kyaikto, capturing three enemy soldiers and seizing three guns. On April 1, the armed forces of the people blew up an armored train with landmines in Bago District, killing and injuring seven policemen, and seizing all weapons and ammunition.

Burmese reactionary newspapers also revealed that the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party have been actively launching attacks in the Irrawaddy, Tanintharyi, and Arakan regions of Lower Burma, as well as in some regions of Upper Burma. On February 24, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party burned down a bridge on the Bhamo-Banmauk highway in northern Burma. On February 25, about twenty members of the National Democratic Front's armed forces burned down a ship belonging to the Burmese reactionary government in the Bando region of the delta. On March 2, the Karen people's armed forces attacked a police outpost in the Dawei District of the Tanintharyi region. In the early hours of March 6, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party surrounded and temporarily captured the town of An in the Arakan region, killing one police chief and three reactionary soldiers, injuring three, and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition. On March 13, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked a police detachment on a motorboat forty miles from the coast in the town of Bopin in the Dawei District, annihilating the enemy and seizing all their weapons. On the same day, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party launched an ambush in the Abudu region of the Bago District, killing three reactionary soldiers and seizing their weapons. At 3 a.m. on March 17, about seventy members of the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked the town of Chonmah in the Myaungmya District, burning down a grain warehouse belonging to the Burmese reactionary government and causing the Burmese reactionary government to lose about seven thousand baskets of rice (each basket weighing forty-six pounds). On March 19, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked a car on the highway in the Thawda District of the Tanintharyi region, killing one enemy soldier and injuring three. On March 20, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party launched an ambush on a platoon of police traveling by car from Langnang to the Thawda District, killing five police officers, including the platoon leader, with landmines, and injuring seven, two of whom died from their injuries. On March 27, the Karen people's armed forces launched an ambush in the Jimawo area of the Maubin District, annihilating a police detachment of seven, and seizing all their weapons. On March 31, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party killed two reactionary policemen in a village in the Dawei District and seized their weapons.

At the same time, the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party carried out campaigns to eliminate traitors and local tyrants in the villages of Bago, Irrawaddy, and northern Burma, executing a group of reactionary officials, landlords, and reactionary elements. These revolutionary actions greatly boosted the morale of the Burmese revolutionary people and greatly dampened the spirits of the Burmese reactionaries.
