The Northeast is red and radiant — warmly celebrating the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee

*People's Daily* and *Liberation Army Daily* Editorial

In the midst of the nation's military and civilian forces advancing victoriously and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been solemnly established!

Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the proletarian headquarters has shown great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning Province. At many critical moments, Chairman Mao has given timely and extremely important instructions, guiding the broad masses of military and civilian personnel in Liaoning to advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line. The establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

We are extremely pleased to extend our warmest congratulations to the proletarian revolutionary factions and the 28 million revolutionary people of Liaoning Province, and to all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Liaoning!

Now, following the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the North China region, revolutionary committees have also been established in all provinces in the Northeast region. The situation is developing rapidly. We must grasp all our work tightly. We hope that the comrades in Liaoning Province, as well as comrades in other regions, will, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," redouble their efforts, strive for the forefront, study new problems that arise in the movement, discover and support new revolutionary things, and vigorously keep up with the developing new situation.

For a long time, the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Northeast and Liaoning, such as Ma Mingfang, Gu Zhuoxin, Yu Ping, and Zhou Huan, have represented the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempted to restore capitalism in Liaoning. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they incited the masses to fight among themselves, disrupted military-civilian unity, and tried to shift the direction of the revolutionary struggle. They attempted to cover up their counter-revolutionary faces and preserve their counter-revolutionary forces. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Liaoning, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have conducted a tenacious struggle against the class enemies, smashed their various plots and tricks, cut off their black hands, exposed their ugly faces in broad daylight, and finally achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning Province.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Liaoning Province, loyal to Chairman Mao, have firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, supported the leftist revolutionary masses, and persistently fought against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They have gone deep into factories and rural areas, closely combined class struggle practice, enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have performed new meritorious deeds for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for revolution."

After the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions must carry forward the thorough and resolute revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and smash the rightist reversal wind. We must deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev and their agents in Liaoning, and fight them down and stink them out. We must strengthen the awareness of enemy situations, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely root out the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, Kuomintang spies, and hidden or infiltrated counter-revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless towards the enemy, suppress him, annihilate him; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, with subordinates."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "We must believe that more than 90% of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be reformed."

We must continue to unite and educate the vast majority of cadres and masses. We must distinguish the few bad elements in the revolutionary mass organizations from the broad revolutionary masses within the organization. We must strictly distinguish between enemy contradictions and people's internal contradictions. We must continue to do a good job of ideological and political work among the broad masses and cadres, constantly strengthen the revolutionary ranks, unite and win over allies, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, rally all revolutionary forces into a mighty revolutionary army to jointly fight the enemy.

The revolutionary committee is a new thing that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must cherish it, support it, consolidate it, develop it, and prevent the class enemies from shaking or overthrowing the revolutionary committee from the right or ultra-left. We must continue to strengthen military-civilian unity. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, "organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses," and make the revolutionary committee a battle command center that highlights proletarian politics.

The work of the revolutionary committee is multifaceted, but the most fundamental thing is to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and deeply carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We must continue to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination by system, industry, and class, and do a good job of struggle-criticism-transformation in one's own unit.

Liaoning is an important industrial base in our country and bears the heavy responsibility of national economic construction. We hope that the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, broad revolutionary masses, and People's Liberation Army in Liaoning Province will resolutely and seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" and make greater contributions on the fronts of national defense, industry, agriculture, and transportation. This is an important aspect of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Due to the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of counter-revolutionaries see that all their plots and tricks have failed and are trying to use more despicable means to obstruct the surging tide of the cultural revolution. The broad military and civilian forces across the country must be clear-eyed and expose the despicable means of the class enemies, achieve a double harvest of revolution and production, and completely and thoroughly foil the sabotage of production by the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders.

Liaoning is advancing victoriously on the revolutionary path under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao. Liaoning has a bright future. Let us work together to build Liaoning into a red and radiant school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    东北大地红烂熳
    ——热烈欢呼辽宁省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在全国军民乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，辽宁省革命委员会隆重成立了！
    以伟大领袖毛主席为首、他的亲密战友林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，十分关怀辽宁省的无产阶级文化大革命。在许多关键时刻，毛主席都及时给予极其重要的指示，引导辽宁省广大军民沿着无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。辽宁省革命委员会的成立，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    我们十分高兴地向辽宁的无产阶级革命派和全省两千八百万革命人民，向驻辽宁的人民解放军全体指战员，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    现在，继华北地区各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会之后，东北地区各省也全部成立了革命委员会。形势发展是很快的。我们的各项工作必须抓紧。希望辽宁省的同志们，以及别的地区的同志们，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，注意研究运动中出现的新问题，发现和支持革命的新事物，朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势。
    长期以来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派，和他们在东北及辽宁地区的代理人马明方、顾卓新、喻屏、周桓等，代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图在辽宁复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们挑动群众斗群众，破坏军民团结，竭力转移革命斗争大方向，妄图掩盖他们的反革命面目，保存他们的反革命势力。忠于毛主席的、以工人阶级为主力军的辽宁无产阶级革命派，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，同阶级敌人进行了英勇不屈的斗争，粉碎了他们的种种阴谋诡计，斩断了他们的黑手，把他们的丑恶面目现形于光天化日之下，终于取得了辽宁省无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    忠于毛主席的驻辽宁省人民解放军广大指战员，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，支持左派广大革命群众，坚持不懈地同党内一小撮走资派进行针锋相对的斗争。他们深入工厂、农村，密切结合阶级斗争实践，热情宣传毛主席最新指示，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立了新功。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    辽宁省革命委员会成立以后，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧紧掌握革命斗争大方向。无产阶级革命派的同志，要发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，抓紧两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风。要深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在辽宁的代理人揭深批透，斗倒斗臭。要加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕，坚决把美帝、苏修、日本、蒋匪特务和隐藏的或混进来的反革命分子挖出来。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”
    毛主席最近又一次指出：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”
    我们要继续努力团结和教育绝大多数干部和群众。要把革命群众组织中的极少数坏人，和这个组织中的广大革命群众区别开来。要注意严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。要继续做好广大群众和广大干部的思想政治工作，不断壮大革命队伍，团结和争取同盟军，使一切革命力量在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，共同对敌。
    革命委员会是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的新事物。我们要以满腔的热情爱护它，支持它，巩固它，发展它，防止阶级敌人从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇、颠覆革命委员会。要继续加强军民团结。要遵照毛主席的教导，“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，使革命委员会成为突出无产阶级政治的战斗指挥部。
    革命委员会工作千头万绪，最根本的是要认真落实毛主席的最新指示，深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。要继续办好毛泽东思想学习班，巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改。
    辽宁是我国重要的工业基地，担负着国家经济建设的重任。希望辽宁省工人阶级、贫下中农、广大革命群众和人民解放军，要坚决地、认真地执行伟大领袖毛主席抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的方针，在国防、工农业、交通运输等战线上作出更大的贡献。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要方面。由于无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，一小撮反革命分子眼看自己各种阴谋诡计统统遭到失败，就妄图用更卑鄙的手法，来阻碍文化大革命的滚滚洪流。全国广大军民必须眼明心亮，揭露阶级敌人的卑鄙手法，夺取革命生产双丰收，使一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派破坏生产的阴谋完全彻底破产。
    辽宁正在伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命大道上胜利前进。辽宁大有希望。让我们共同努力，把辽宁建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
