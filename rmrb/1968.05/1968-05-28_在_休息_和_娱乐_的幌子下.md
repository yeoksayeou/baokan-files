	In the past, we didn't really understand what art was all about. We just knew it was for having a good time. After studying Chairman Mao's works, our minds are clear. Chairman Mao said, "Art should be used 'as a weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and destroy the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.' Chairman Mao's words really hit the mark. Take drama, for example. Although all performances are dramas, old dramas and new dramas are completely different. Old dramas don't have any role for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Emperors, generals, and ministers shout orders on stage, while young masters and misses pull and tug at each other. Watching it makes you feel uncomfortable inside. New dramas, on the other hand, talk about our own affairs and depict heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Watching them fills you with energy. To say that drama, regardless of its content, is just for fun is misleading. That's not the case at all.

	But that scoundrel, Chinese Khrushchev, has evil intentions. He blathers on about how "watching a play can provide rest, make people happy, and that's good. Entertainment and rest encourage socialist enthusiasm. Watching 'Swan Lake' can boost morale, and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' also has a high artistic level and educational value."

	Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense is all lies. Everyone knows that in a class society, there is no art that merely entertains and amuses people. As our great leader Mao Zedong said, "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art are class culture or literature and art, and they are all for one class or the other, for one political line or the other." Take "The White-Haired Girl," for example. We poor and lower-middle peasants watch it and feel proud, while landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists watch it and feel downcast. How can there be the same "morale"? In fact, Chinese Khrushchev's talk of "rest," "entertainment," and encouraging "socialist enthusiasm" is all nonsense. What kind of stuff is the "Swan Lake" he drools over? It's about a foreign prince and princess falling in love, just like our own tales of talented scholars and beautiful women. Who's morale can "Swan Lake" boost? Landlords and capitalists are happy, but we laboring people are disgusted. Can plays like "Swan Lake," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "The Orphan of Zhao," and "The Love of the Four Seasons" that Chinese Khrushchev praises so highly make us proletarians and the broad masses of laboring people "happy," "rested," and encourage "socialist enthusiasm"? No, they can't. They can only "rest" in revisionism and "put to sleep" our revolutionary spirit! Chinese Khrushchev is using this trick to try to lead us unwittingly down the capitalist path.

	This is what Chinese Khrushchev thinks and does.

	Under the pretext of "rest" and "entertainment," Chinese Khrushchev desperately uses feudal, capitalist, and revisionist trash to corrupt the people's revolutionary will and disperse the people's revolutionary spirit. In the past, whenever there was a farming lull or during festivals, Chinese Khrushchev's lackeys would say: "Everyone has worked hard, it's time to put on a show to relax and unwind!" What kind of shows did they put on? They were all about emperors and generals showing off their might, and young masters and misses flirting. Things like "The Heavenly Matchmaker," "The Flower as the Go-Between," "The Third Visit to the Younger Sister," and "The Peony Pavilion." Some young people in our village, after watching these shows, felt that working in the countryside was pointless and always wanted to find work in the city. Some young women even wore flowered headscarves and big masks while working in the fields, afraid of getting tanned and not finding a satisfactory partner. In a word, these bad shows only "scatter" our hearts for the socialist revolution and "loosen" our spirit for building socialism. What kind of "rest" and "entertainment" is this? Behind the "rest" and "entertainment," Chinese Khrushchev is wielding a soft knife that doesn't show blood!

	Under the pretext of "rest" and "entertainment," Chinese Khrushchev vigorously uses anti-party, anti-socialist trash to encourage capitalist enthusiasm. Chinese Khrushchev is a capitalist fanatic. To realize his delusional dream of changing the sky, his cheerleaders for restoring capitalism, according to his instructions, hastily produced a large amount of poisonous weeds. He complained that there was too little capitalism in China, so his cheerleaders threw out "Civilized Hell" to cheer for capitalism; he advocated "exploitation is meritorious," so his cheerleaders concocted "City That Never Sleeps" to build monuments and sing praises for capitalists. During the three years of temporary difficulties, Chinese Khrushchev raised the black flag of "self-reliance, self-management, and contracting production to households." His cheerleaders immediately responded, hastily producing a poisonous film "Two Families," urging us to learn from Gao Zhengguo, who had a head full of "money," to struggle to make a living, to scheme to get rich, to have two hearts towards the Party, and to be two families with socialism. A landlord element in our village, after watching this film, became very arrogant. He stole the production team's carts and livestock, planted a lot of marginal land, and sold high-priced grain. Some villagers in our village, after watching the film, were also deceived and did not work hard in collective production, but were very enthusiastic about planting marginal land. In a word, Chinese Khrushchev wants to dismantle the socialist stage and build a bridge to capitalism. What kind of "rest" and "entertainment" is this? Behind the "rest" and "entertainment," Chinese Khrushchev is holding the landlord and capitalist class's account for changing the sky!

	Chinese Khrushchev's trick is very vicious. On one hand, he smiles and says: "Art, as long as it can amuse and make people laugh, is good"; on the other hand, he reveals a ferocious look, desperately using his trash to corrupt us, to sedate us, hoping to change the flag on the city wall without using guns or knives, to make the landlord and capitalist class celebrate again, and to make us laboring people suffer again. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Chinese Khrushchev desperately opposes Chairman Mao's instructions, so we must definitely firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, use revolutionary art to raise the people's awareness and inspire the people to move forward; use revolutionary art to expose the enemy and strike the enemy!

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing victoriously, and the current situation is excellent. However, the enemy has not "rested," they are still struggling and counterattacking. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a prolonged revolutionary criticism, continue to launch fierce attacks on the class enemy, and absolutely not let the enemy get any "rest" or breathing space to counterattack. This is a life-and-death class struggle, and there is no room for the slightest hesitation!

    在“休息”和“娱乐”的幌子下
    北京市大兴县黄村公社一街大队　王凤玉
    以前，文艺是个啥玩意儿，咱闹不大清楚，光知道图个热闹。学了毛主席著作，咱心里亮堂了。毛主席说，要使文艺“作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”毛主席的话，真说到咱心坎里了。就拿演戏来说吧，别看都是演戏，旧戏和新戏可大不一样。旧戏里根本没有咱贫下中农的份儿，帝王将相在台上吆三喝四，公子小姐在那里拉拉扯扯，看了打心里感到不舒服；新戏里说的全是咱们自个儿的事，演的是毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，看了浑身都是劲儿。说演戏不管演啥内容，只是闹个乐，那是懵人，根本没那回事儿。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个家伙没安好心眼，他胡说什么“看了戏，能得到休息，使人高兴，就很好。搞娱乐、休息，就鼓励了社会主义积极性了，看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致，《巴黎圣母院》的艺术水平也很高，也有教育作用。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫这一套，完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。大伙儿知道，在阶级社会里，只是给人逗逗乐、解解气的艺术是没有的。正如伟大领袖毛主席所说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”就拿《白毛女》来说，咱贫下中农看了扬眉吐气，地富反坏右看了垂头丧气，哪有一样的“兴致”？其实，中国赫鲁晓夫说的“休息”呀，“娱乐”呀，鼓励“社会主义积极性”呀，全是骗人的鬼话。他溅着唾沫星子推荐的《天鹅湖》是什么货色？写的是外国王子公主的谈情说爱，完全和中国的才子佳人一个调调。《天鹅湖》能提高谁的“兴致”？地主资产阶级看了开心，咱劳动人民看了恶心。象《天鹅湖》、《巴黎圣母院》、《四郎探母》、《游龙戏凤》这些中国赫鲁晓夫所津津乐道的玩意儿，能使咱无产阶级和广大劳动人民“高兴”，“得到休息”，鼓励“社会主义积极性”吗？不能，它只能“休”出修正主义，“息”掉咱的革命热情！中国赫鲁晓夫就是利用这一套，想在不知不觉之中，把咱“鼓励”到资本主义道道上去。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是这么想的，也是这么干的。
    在“休息”和“娱乐”的幌子下，中国赫鲁晓夫拚命用封、资、修的黑货来腐蚀人民的革命意志，涣散人民的革命精神。过去，逢到农闲或过年过节，中国赫鲁晓夫的娄罗们就说：大伙儿辛苦了，该演个戏散散心、松口气啦！他们拿出的是啥戏呢？都是帝王将相耀武扬威、公子小姐打情骂俏的坏戏，什么《天河配》、《花为媒》、《三看御妹》、《桃花庵》等等。咱村里的一些年轻人看了这些戏以后，有些人觉得在农村劳动没出息，成天想着到城里去找工作；有些年轻妇女上地还戴着花头巾，捂着大口罩，生怕晒黑了脸，找不着满意的对象。一句话，这些坏戏只能“散”掉咱搞社会主义革命的“心”，“松”掉咱建设社会主义的“气”。这是什么“休息”和“娱乐”？在“休息”和“娱乐”的背后，中国赫鲁晓夫拿的是杀人不见血的软刀子！
    在“休息”和“娱乐”的幌子下，中国赫鲁晓夫极力用反党反社会主义的黑货来鼓励资本主义的积极性。中国赫鲁晓夫是个资本主义迷，为了实现他变天的痴心妄想，他的复辟资本主义的啦啦队根据他的意旨，赶制了大量的毒草。他抱怨中国的资本主义太少，他的啦啦队就抛出《文明地狱》，为资本主义喝彩叫好；他鼓吹“剥削有功”，他的啦啦队就炮制了《不夜城》，为资本家立牌坊，唱颂歌……。在三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫祭起了“三自一包”的黑旗，他的啦啦队立即应声而出，赶制了一部毒草影片《两家人》，号召咱们去向一个脑袋瓜里满是“钱”字的高正国学习，苦拽扒拉地去搞单干，黑了心眼去谋发家，跟党两条心，跟社会主义做两家人。咱村里一个地主分子看了这部电影后，气焰十分嚣张。他盗用生产队的大车牲口，大种十边地，大卖高价粮。咱村有些社员看了影片以后，也被糊弄住了，不安心集体生产，拾掇十边地却很带劲。一句话，中国赫鲁晓夫要拆社会主义的台，搭通资本主义的桥。这是什么“休息”和“娱乐”？在“休息”和“娱乐”的背后，中国赫鲁晓夫拿的是地主资产阶级的变天账！
    中国赫鲁晓夫这一手很毒辣。他一边满脸堆笑地说：文艺嘛，能逗个乐，闹个笑就很好；一边露出一副凶相，拚命用他那套黑货来腐蚀咱，麻醉咱，妄想不动枪，不动刀，城头上面换旗号，使地主资产阶级重新张灯结彩，咱劳动人民重新受苦受罪。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫拚命反对毛主席的指示，我们就一定要坚决贯彻毛主席的指示，用革命的文艺来提高人民的觉悟，鼓舞人民前进；用革命的文艺来狠狠地揭露敌人，狠狠地打击敌人！
    无产阶级文化大革命正在乘胜前进，目前形势一片大好。但是，敌人并没有“休息”，他们还在挣扎，还在反扑。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，展开持久的革命大批判，向阶级敌人继续发动猛烈的进攻，决不能让敌人得到“休息”，得到喘息反扑的机会。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，容不得半点的含糊！
