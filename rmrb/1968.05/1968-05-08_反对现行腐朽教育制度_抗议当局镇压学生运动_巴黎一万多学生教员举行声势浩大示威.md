Paris: Over ten thousand students and teachers held a massive demonstration in Paris on the 6th to protest against France's corrupt educational system and the government's suppression of student movements. Demonstrators built barricades and fought fiercely with armed police throughout the day. The Paris students' brave struggle has shaken France, causing the ruling class to panic.

Since the beginning of this year, French students have been continuously fighting against the country's corrupt educational system. To suppress the rising student movement, the French government closed the Nanterre Literary Institute and the University of Paris in the suburbs of Paris last week. On the 3rd, a large number of police brutally stormed the University of Paris campus, beating students, and over five hundred students were arrested. The French government's atrocities sparked a new wave of student movements. That day, thousands of university students took to the streets to demonstrate and bravely fought with the police.

On the 6th, about ten thousand university students held a massive demonstration in the Left Bank university district of Paris to protest against the police's brutality. Over a thousand university teachers, including some famous professors, joined the demonstration and fought side by side with the students. The French government deployed helicopters to direct a large number of fully armed police, using high-pressure water cannons, tear gas, smoke bombs, batons, and gun butts to brutally suppress the demonstrators.

The students fought back fiercely. They dug up paving stones from the sidewalks and roads, and tore down iron railings as weapons to bravely fight against the police. The students built several layers of barricades on the streets using overturned cars. They destroyed high-pressure water cannons and damaged some police cars, repelling the police's attacks several times. Some demonstrators also held up red flags, sang the "Internationale," and shouted slogans protesting the police's brutality as they crossed the Seine River and held demonstrations in the bustling areas of Paris. During the day-long struggle, over five hundred students were injured, and four hundred seventy-five were unjustly arrested. However, the Paris students were not intimidated by the savage suppression. They vowed to hold more demonstrations to protest against the police's brutality and called on students across France to go on a general strike to support their struggle.

The Paris students' brave struggle has caused the French ruling class to panic. The Paris police chief, Grimou, worriedly said that the students' resistance against violence would "escalate." Western news agencies have pointed out that the Paris students' struggle on the 6th was an unprecedentedly intense mass violent struggle in France in decades. They also had to admit that the recent surge in the French student movement, like in some other Western European countries, had deeper reasons: young students were increasingly dissatisfied with the corrupt capitalist system.

The Paris students' struggle has received widespread support both domestically and internationally. University students in Grenoble, Strasbourg, and Dijon held meetings and demonstrations on the 6th to support the Paris students' struggle. Seven hundred university students in Frankfurt, West Germany, also held a demonstration in front of the French consulate on the same day to protest against the French government's suppression of the student movement.

In this struggle of the Paris students, the French revisionist group has shamelessly collaborated with the fascist police in their bloody suppression of students, openly playing the despicable role of accomplices to the French ruling class. The Nanterre city government, controlled by the revisionists, publicly issued a statement attacking the students' struggle at the Nanterre Literary Institute for "disrupting" the institute's "normal activities." The leaders of the revisionist group also repeatedly took the initiative to publish articles in "L'Humanité" attacking the students' just struggle.

    新华社七日讯　巴黎消息：法国学生和教员一万多人六日在巴黎举行声势浩大的示威，反对法国现行的腐朽的教育制度，抗议法国当局镇压学生运动。示威者筑起街垒，同全副武装的警察浴血搏斗了一整天。巴黎学生的英勇斗争震动了法国，使法国统治集团惶惶不安。
    今年以来，法国学生不断进行反对法国现行的腐朽的教育制度的斗争。为了镇压日益高涨的学生运动，法国当局上星期封闭了巴黎近郊的农泰尔文学院和巴黎大学。大批警察三日悍然冲进巴黎大学校园，野蛮地殴打学生，五百多名学生被捕。法国当局的暴行激起了法国学生运动的新高潮。当天，几千名大学生就上街举行示威，同警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    六日，约一万名大学生在巴黎塞纳河左岸大学区举行声势浩大的示威，抗议警察的暴行。包括一些著名的教授在内的一千多名大学教员参加了示威的行列，和大学生并肩战斗。法国当局出动了直升飞机，指挥大批全副武装的警察，使用高压水龙、催泪弹、烟幕弹、警棍、枪托，对示威者进行血腥镇压。
    学生们奋起进行反击。他们挖起人行道和马路上的石块，拔起路旁的铁栏杆作为武器，同警察英勇地搏斗。学生们在大街上用翻倒的几十辆汽车筑起了几重街垒。他们砸坏了高压水龙，捣毁了一些警车，几次击退了警察的进攻。有些示威者还高举着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，高呼抗议警察暴行的口号，越过塞纳河，在巴黎的闹市区举行示威游行。在整天的搏斗中，有五百多名学生受伤，四百七十五人被无理逮捕。但是，巴黎学生并没有被野蛮的镇压吓倒。他们表示还要再次举行示威，抗议警察的暴行；并呼吁法国各地学生举行总罢课，支持他们的斗争。
    巴黎学生的英勇斗争使法国统治集团惶惶不安。巴黎警察头子格里穆十分担心地说，学生的抗暴斗争还会“升级”。西方通讯社纷纷指出，巴黎学生六日的斗争是法国几十年来空前未有的一次激烈的群众性暴力斗争。它们还不得不承认，法国学生运动最近的高涨，同其他一些西欧国家一样，有着更为深刻的原因：这就是青年学生对腐朽的资本主义制度日益感到不满。
    巴黎学生的斗争在国内外得到广泛的支持。格勒诺布勒、斯特拉斯堡和第戎等法国城市的大学生，六日举行了集会和示威，支持巴黎学生的斗争。西德法兰克福的七百名大学生，同日在法国总领事馆前举行示威，抗议法国当局镇压学生运动。
    在这次巴黎学生的斗争中，法国修正主义集团竟然同血腥镇压学生的法西斯警察紧密配合，公开扮演了法国统治集团帮凶的可耻角色。法修掌握的农泰尔市政府就公然发表公报，攻击农泰尔文学院学生的斗争“阻挠”了学院的“正常活动”。法修集团的头目还一再亲自出马，在《人道报》上发表文章，攻击学生的正义斗争。
