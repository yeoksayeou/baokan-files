The Seine River roars, and Paris trembles. The revolutionary students of France have risen up! They strike, demonstrate, occupy schools, fan the flames of revolution, and ignite the fire of rebellion. They have formed a revolutionary force of young students, fighting shoulder to shoulder with workers, striking a heavy blow against the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie.

The Internationale echoes through the heavens. All of France is in turmoil!

"Unite, until tomorrow..."—The revolutionary students of France sing this stirring song of revolutionary struggle, raise the red flag high, and shout the revolutionary slogans "Workers and students unite!" and "Long live the workers' struggle!" They bravely fight and gradually merge with the surging tide of workers' strikes sweeping across France, supporting each other and forming a mighty revolutionary army. Their momentum is like an avalanche, unstoppable. This is an important development in the French people's movement, marking the further awakening of the French workers and students and the further strengthening of revolutionary forces.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as May 1939: "Intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing." Only when the revolutionary force composed of young students integrates with the revolutionary force composed of the broad masses of workers and peasants can a powerful revolutionary army be formed. "With this army, we can break through the enemy's strongholds and capture the enemy's last bastion." This is a summary of China's revolutionary experience, a truth that is universally applicable. It has not only been proven by China's past revolutions but also by the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The people's movements in Europe and North America are also proving the correctness of this great truth.

The revolutionary workers and peasants of France are the main force of the revolution, and the revolutionary students of France are an important part of the revolution. Relying solely on an important part of the revolution is not enough to defeat the enemy; similarly, relying solely on the main force is not enough to defeat the enemy well. Only the unity of workers and students can defeat the reactionaries in their own country. Therefore, the current combination of the revolutionary student movement and the revolutionary workers' movement in France is the correct path.

"Unite, until tomorrow..." The students and workers of France have joined forces, striking fear into the hearts of the capitalist countries' scoundrels. The British *Scotsman* could not help but exclaim, "Students and workers joining hands to oppose the government, this may be the first time in the Western world today." The West German *Bild* was even more terrified, lamenting, "Let's just hope that there won't be another revolution in France." As for the French reactionaries sitting on a volcano, their fear is self-evident. Isn't this a sufficient proof of the power of the unity of French workers and students?

However, the leaders of the French revisionist trade unions, out of their traitorous instincts of the reactionary class, in order to curry favor with the French reactionaries, do not hesitate to use despicable means to attack and oppose the unity of revolutionary students and revolutionary workers. They maliciously claim that "the working class does not need guardians," and even openly slander the unity of young students and revolutionary workers as "interference" and "provocation," and so on. They are utterly shameless! However, no matter how the modern revisionists obstruct, the development of the student and worker movements in France is not subject to the will of people. It will not only bury the French reactionaries but also bury all kinds of traitors and labor scabs!

    团结起来，到明天……
    北京航空学院革命委员会　红旗战斗队
    塞纳河在怒吼，巴黎城在震荡。法国革命的学生，冲杀出来了！他们罢课，示威，占领学校，煽革命之风，点革命造反之火。他们形成了一支青年学生的革命队伍，同工人并肩战斗，狠狠打击法国垄断资产阶级反动统治。
    《国际歌》声震天动地。整个法国沸腾了！
    “团结起来，到明天……”——法国的革命学生高唱着这支激励革命者战斗的豪迈歌曲，高举红旗，高呼“工人学生团结起来”、“工人斗争万岁”的革命口号，展开英勇的斗争，并且同席卷全法国的工人罢工浪潮逐步汇合起来，互相支持，组成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，其势如排山倒海，锐不可当。这是法国人民运动的一个重要发展，它标志着法国工人、学生觉悟的进一步提高和革命力量的进一步壮大。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早在一九三九年五月就指出过：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”只有当青年学生所组成的革命队伍，同广大的工农民众所组成的革命队伍结合起来，才能形成一支强有力的革命大军。“有了这支大军，才能攻破敌人的坚固阵地，才能攻破敌人的最后堡垒。”这是中国革命经验的总结，是放之四海而皆准的真理。它不仅被中国过去的革命所证明，而且也为中国现在进行的无产阶级文化大革命所证明。欧洲、北美所发生的人民运动也正在证明这一伟大真理的正确性。
    法国革命的工农群众是革命的主力军，法国的革命学生是革命的重要方面军。单靠一支重要方面军是不能战胜敌人的；同时，单靠一支主力军也是不能很好地战胜敌人的。只有工人、学生相结合，才能战胜本国的反动派。因此，当前法国革命的学生运动同革命的工人运动相结合，是一条正确的道路。
    “团结起来，到明天……”。法国学生和工人拧成了一股绳，吓慌了资本主义各国的害人虫。英国的《苏格兰人报》禁不住惊呼，法国“学生和工人携起手来反对政府，这在现在西方世界中也许还是第一次”。西德《图片报》更是胆战心惊地悲鸣，“只希望在法国不要再发生一次革命”。至于坐在火山上的法国反动派惶惶不可终日，就不言而喻了。这不是充分证明法国工人、学生相结合的威力吗？
    但是，法修工会头目出于他们叛徒的反动阶级的本能，为了向法国反动派献媚取宠，不惜采取卑鄙的手段，百般攻击和反对革命学生同革命工人相结合。他们胡说什么“工人阶级不需要监护人”，甚至公然把青年学生同革命工人相结合诬蔑为“干预”、“挑衅”，等等。真是无耻到了极点！但是，不管现代修正主义者如何阻挡，法国学生、工人运动的发展是不以人们的意志为转移的。它不仅会埋葬法国反动派，而且也会埋葬形形色色的叛徒和工贼！
