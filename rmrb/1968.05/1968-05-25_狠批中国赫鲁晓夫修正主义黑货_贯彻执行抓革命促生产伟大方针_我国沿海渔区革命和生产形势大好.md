The revolutionary masses and cadres in China's coastal fishing areas, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have fully displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, bringing about a new and vibrant situation in both revolution and production. This year, the spring fishing production in coastal areas has developed compared to last year, with some areas achieving significant increases. Marine aquaculture in various places has also seen a good situation, with the cultivation area of kelp reaching a record high.

Since the beginning of spring, from the Yellow Sea in the north to the Gulf of Tonkin in the south, the revolutionary masses and cadres in the vast coastal fishing areas, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have launched a new high tide of mass movements to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, aiming to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a good harvest in spring fishing production. The coastal fishing areas, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The revolutionary masses and cadres participating in these study classes have diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions while addressing issues in revolution and production. The fishing area's revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, including the Chinese Khrushchev. Before the start of the spring fishing season, fishermen had already criticized the revisionist junk such as "four freedoms," "three guarantees and one reward," and "production responsibility to the boat" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places, and cleansed their poison in various aspects. The revolutionary masses and cadres in various fishing areas, through the criticism of revisionist junk, have heightened their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and have become even more enthusiastic about Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and socialism, expressing their determination to firmly walk the socialist road.

At the same time, various coastal fishing areas are actively preparing for spring fishing production to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest. This year, the early spring weather is cold, the water temperature is low, and the waves are high, making the fishing patterns of fish schools more variable. This has added many difficulties to the spring fishing production. The revolutionary masses and cadres in various fishing areas have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, fully displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and have bravely fought against various difficulties. Coupled with the fact that the preparation work for spring fishing production has been relatively good, the time of going to sea is generally earlier than last year, and the number of ships going to sea has generally increased compared to last year. This has made the spring fishing production, despite the many difficulties, appear in a new and vibrant situation.

Currently, the revolutionary masses and cadres in China's coastal fishing areas are continuing to advance with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held high. They are firmly grasping the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, determined to thoroughly implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," strive to overcome various difficulties that may arise on the way forward, and achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑货　贯彻执行抓革命促生产伟大方针
    我国沿海渔区革命和生产形势大好
    新华社二十四日讯　我国沿海渔区的广大革命群众和革命干部，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，高度发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，使革命、生产都出现了朝气勃勃的新局面。今年沿海渔区的春汛生产都比去年有发展，其中有一些渔区比去年有较大幅度的增产。各地海水养殖事业也出现了大好局面，其中海带的养殖面积创造了历年来的最高纪录。
    入春以来，从北方的黄海之滨到南海的北部湾，在广大的沿海渔区内，革命群众和革命干部在人民解放军的帮助下，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利和渔业春汛生产的好收成，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作和全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动的新高潮。广大沿海渔区根据伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，纷纷举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的广大革命群众和革命干部，带着革命和生产中的问题努力活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示。渔区的革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派所推行的反革命修正主义路线。春汛开始前，渔民们已对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人所推行的“四大自由”、“三包一奖”、“包产到船”等修正主义黑货展开了批判，并从各个方面肃清其流毒。各个渔区的革命群众和革命干部，通过对修正主义黑货的批判，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加热爱社会主义，表示要更加坚定地走社会主义道路。
    沿海各个渔区同时积极进行春汛生产的准备工作，为夺取春汛生产的丰收打好基础。今年早春天气冷，水温低，风浪大，鱼群洄游规律多变。这给春汛生产增加了不少困难。各个渔区的革命群众和革命干部，活学活用毛泽东思想，高度发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，英勇不屈地同各种困难展开了顽强的斗争，加之春汛生产的准备工作进行得比较好，出海的时间普遍较去年提早，出海的船只大都比去年有所增加，这就使得春汛生产在困难较多的条件下，仍然出现了朝气蓬勃的新局面。
    当前，我国沿海渔区的广大革命群众和革命干部，正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗继续乘胜前进。他们狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，决心深入地贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，努力排除前进途中可能碰到的各种困难，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
