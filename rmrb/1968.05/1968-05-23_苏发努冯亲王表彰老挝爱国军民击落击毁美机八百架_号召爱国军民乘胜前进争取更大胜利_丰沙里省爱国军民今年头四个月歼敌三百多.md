Prince Souphanouvong Commends Lao Patriotic Military and Civilians for Shooting Down and Destroying 800 U.S. Aircraft
Calls for Further Victory as Patriotic Military and Civilians in Phongsaly Province Eliminate Over 300 Enemy Soldiers in the First Four Months of the Year

KANGO, May 22 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a statement by Chairman Prince Souphanouvong, warmly commending the Lao patriotic military and civilians for their brilliant achievement of shooting down and destroying 800 U.S. aggressor aircraft by May 16. The statement also calls on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to press forward and achieve greater victories.

Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that the brilliant victory of shooting down and destroying 800 U.S. aggressor aircraft by the Lao patriotic military and civilians demonstrates their heroic fighting spirit. This victory has given the U.S. air aggressors the punishment they deserve and exposed the myth of U.S. "air superiority."

Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that under the heavy blows of the Lao patriotic military and civilians, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have suffered heavy defeats. However, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have not abandoned their plot to expand their armed aggression.

Prince Souphanouvong called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to carry forward the tradition of heroic struggle, annihilate more of the enemy's fighting forces, and achieve greater victories.

The Lao People's Liberation Army High Command also sent a telegram to the patriotic military and civilians in the Savannakhet Province of Lower Laos, congratulating them on their achievement of shooting down the 800th U.S. aggressor aircraft.

KANGO, May 22 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio, the patriotic military and civilians in Phongsaly Province, in the first four months of this year, have continuously attacked the enemy, eliminating and dissolving 328 enemy soldiers, seizing over 300 weapons of various types and a large amount of military supplies. At the same time, many regions have been liberated from the control of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The patriotic military and civilians in Xam Neua Province, in early May, completely annihilated a platoon of rightist troops and seized a batch of weapons.

According to another report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on May 11, the patriotic military and civilians in Xieng Khouang Province launched a sudden attack on the command structure of the 24th Battalion of the rightist Lao troops in the Moung district. After a few minutes of fighting, they killed 51 enemy soldiers, most of whom were officers.
