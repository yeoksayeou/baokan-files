The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted on May 14 that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand recently issued a statement highly praising Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The statement by the CCP of Thailand said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement is a great historical document of Marxism-Leninism, a scientific summary of the experience of the world revolution, and a battle cry to smash colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation.

The statement said that Chairman Mao's great statement is a strong support from the 700 million Chinese people for the struggle of American blacks against violence. This great statement is like a shining beacon, pointing the way for the revolutionary struggles of American blacks, the people of the world, and the Thai people. Therefore, Chairman Mao's statement has shaken the world, greatly encouraging and supporting the struggles of American blacks, the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world, and the Thai people. The Communist Party of Thailand and the revolutionary people of Thailand warmly welcome and wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's extremely important statement.

The statement emphasized that the current world revolution has entered a new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. The peoples of the world have heavily struck the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, and the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. On the battlefield of Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists have been beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people. The victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have plunged the U.S. imperialists into serious political and economic crises. The storm of the struggle of American blacks has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, who are in a predicament both internally and externally, and has powerfully supported the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism.

The statement condemned the U.S. imperialists for intensifying military adventures, ruthlessly suppressing, and playing political tricks, attempting to extinguish the burgeoning revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. The statement pointed out that the modern revisionists, with the Soviet revisionist leadership group as the center, are actively collaborating with U.S. imperialism and running errands for the various tricks played by U.S. imperialism.

The statement said that Chairman Mao's statement correctly pointed out: "Martin Luther King is a non-violent advocate, but the U.S. imperialists did not tolerate him, but used counter-revolutionary violence to carry out bloody suppression against him." This incident has once again deeply educated the Thai people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations must not rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys for their liberation, but only through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle can they achieve victory." The Thai people have learned from their own experience that they must use revolutionary violence to defeat counter-revolutionary violence to achieve thorough liberation.

The statement expressed that the Communist Party members and revolutionary people of Thailand will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and better learn and master Mao Zedong Thought. The statement called on the Communist Party members of Thailand, the armed fighters of the Thai people, and the revolutionary people of Thailand to respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions, thoroughly smash the political tricks of the U.S.-Thanom group, and carry the armed revolutionary struggle to the end.

The statement said that the struggle of American blacks and laborers for liberation is consistent with the struggle of the Thai people for liberation, and they must support and encourage each other.

The statement finally said that Chairman Mao pointed out: "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, is not far off." As long as the Thai people persist in waging a protracted and fierce people's war against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, victory will surely belong to the Thai people.

    毛主席的声明是具有伟大历史意义的马列主义光辉文献
    泰国人民必须用革命暴力战胜反革命暴力才能彻底解放
    谴责美帝加紧进行军事冒险、疯狂镇压和玩弄政治欺骗，指责苏修为美帝玩弄的各种欺骗伎俩奔走效劳
    新华社十七日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台十四日广播，泰国共产党中央委员会最近发表声明，高度赞扬毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。泰共中央的声明说，毛泽东主席的声明是具有伟大历史意义的马克思列宁主义的光辉文献，是对世界革命的经验作了科学的总结，是向世界革命人民发出摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的战斗号角。
    声明说，毛主席的伟大声明，是七亿中国人民对美国黑人抗暴斗争的强大声援。这个伟大声明象一盏光辉四射的指路明灯，给美国黑人、世界人民和泰国人民的革命斗争指出了正确方向。因此，毛主席声明震撼了全世界，极大地鼓舞和支持了美国黑人、全世界被压迫、被剥削人民和泰国人民的斗争。泰国共产党和泰国革命人民热烈欢迎和衷心拥护毛主席这个极其重要的声明。
    声明强调说，当前世界革命已经进入伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，世界革命人民沉重地打击了美帝国主义和它的仆从，世界革命形势大好。在越南战场上，美帝国主义被英勇的越南人民打得焦头烂额。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争的胜利，使美帝国主义陷入严重的政治危机和经济危机之中。美国黑人斗争的风暴，给处于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击，有力地支援了越南人民和世界革命人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    声明谴责美帝国主义加紧进行军事冒险、疯狂镇压和玩弄政治欺骗，妄图扑灭蓬勃发展的各国人民的革命斗争。声明指出，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义正积极配合美帝国主义，为美帝玩弄的各种欺骗伎俩奔走效劳。
    声明说，毛主席声明正确指出：“马丁·路德·金是一个非暴力主义者，但美帝国主义者并没有因此对他宽容，而是使用反革命的暴力，对他进行血腥的镇压。”这件事再一次深刻地教育了泰国人民。毛主席教导我们说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”泰国人民从亲身经历中懂得，必须用革命的暴力去战胜反革命的暴力，才能获得彻底的解放。
    声明表示，泰国共产党员和泰国革命人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地学习和掌握毛泽东思想。声明号召泰国共产党员、泰国人民武装指战员和泰国的革命人民，用实际行动来响应毛主席的伟大号召，彻底粉碎美国—他侬集团的政治骗局，把革命武装斗争进行到底。
    声明说，美国黑人和劳动人民争取解放的斗争同泰国人民争取解放的斗争是一致的，必须互相支援，互相鼓舞。
    声明最后说，毛主席指出：“殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”泰国人民只要坚持同美帝及其走狗进行持久的猛烈的人民战争，胜利一定属于泰国人民。
