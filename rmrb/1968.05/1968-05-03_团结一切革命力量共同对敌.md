The night of May Day, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, together with the revolutionary people of the capital, celebrated the common holiday of the world's working people. This is the greatest concern and encouragement for the revolutionary masses and revolutionary people across the country. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and is always heart-to-heart with them. We will forever follow the great teacher Chairman Mao and march forward bravely.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is getting better and better. Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions are increasingly ingrained in people's hearts. The revolutionary tide is washing away the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Our revolutionary ranks are becoming stronger, and our revolutionary forces are invincible. The situation at our Guang'anmen Station is also good. The Revolutionary Committee is becoming more consolidated. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Revolutionary workers at the station consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, launching a high tide of revolutionizing production.

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are the beacon guiding us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The practice of class struggle makes us realize more deeply that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. Recently, at our Guang'anmen Station, a small handful of class enemies, in collaboration with the rightist wind of rehabilitation in society, have been actively engaged in rehabilitation activities. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we have led the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce offensive against this small handful of class enemies, smashing their sinister plots to rehabilitate. We deeply understand that this is just one episode of the sharp and intense class struggle. In the future, there will still be sharp and intense class struggles. We must never have the idea of peaceful complacency and must never relax our offensive against the enemy.

Great leader Chairman Mao spending May Day night with revolutionary masses has given us boundless strength and courage. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct our spearhead against the handful of capitalist roaders in the Party headed by China's Khrushchev and all class enemies, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist goods that China's Khrushchev has promoted in the railway system, eliminate their poisonous influence, and uproot the roots of revisionism. We will use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as our weapon, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces, launch a more fierce offensive against the handful of traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and dig out all the class enemies!

Looking ahead with an open mind and striding forward with heads held high! We will make the fire of revolutionary criticism burn even more fiercely and the drums of class struggle beat even louder. We are determined to follow the course opened by Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

      “五一”国际劳动节的夜晚，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，同首都革命人民一起欢度世界劳动人民的共同节日，这是对全国无产阶级革命派和革命人民的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。毛主席最相信群众，永远同群众心连心。我们要永远紧跟伟大导师毛主席奋勇前进。
    目前，全国无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好。毛主席的一系列最新指示更加深入人心，革命的洪流正冲刷着国民党反动派的残渣余孽，我们的革命队伍更加强大，革命力量所向无敌。我们广安门车站的形势也很好，革命委员会日益巩固，战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加普及、更加深入人心，广大革命职工自觉地用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，掀起了抓革命促生产的高潮。
    毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的光辉指示，是引导我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。阶级斗争的实践，使我们更加深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。在我们广安门车站，最近有一小撮阶级敌人配合社会上的右倾翻案妖风，大搞翻案活动。我们遵照毛主席的指示，带领广大革命群众，向这一小撮阶级敌人主动发起了猛烈进攻，粉碎了他们妄图翻案的阴谋诡计。我们深深懂得，这只是尖锐激烈的阶级斗争的一幕，今后，还会有尖锐激烈的阶级斗争，我们任何时候都不能有太平麻痹思想，不能放松对敌人的进攻。
    伟大领袖毛主席同革命群众同度“五一”之夜，给了我们以无限的力量和勇气。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫在铁路系统推行的修正主义黑货彻底批深批臭，肃清其流毒，挖掉修正主义的根子。我们要以毛主席最新指示为武器，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切革命力量，向混进革命队伍中的一小撮叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，发起更猛烈的进攻，把阶级敌人统统挖出来！
    放开眼界看未来，昂首阔步向前进！我们要把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，把阶级斗争的战鼓擂得更响，我们决心沿着毛主席开辟的航道乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
