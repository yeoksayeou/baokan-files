The struggle of Taiwanese compatriots against the bloody rule and ruthless exploitation by U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is developing continuously.

New China News Agency, May 27 — The struggle of Taiwanese compatriots against the bloody rule and ruthless exploitation by U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is developing continuously.

U.S. monopolistic capital has recently invaded Taiwan on a larger scale, like a raging flood, utilizing Taiwan's cheap labor and abundant resources to invest heavily in factories and dumping goods and surplus agricultural products, plundering Taiwan's economy. Taiwan's national industries and agriculture are gasping for breath under the severe blows of U.S. monopolistic capital, sparking strong dissatisfaction among Taiwanese farmers and businesspeople. In March, the Taiwan Paper Industry Association and the Taiwan Paper Products Industry Association sent representatives to the "Control Yuan" of the Chiang clique to strongly protest the approval of the establishment of a paper box factory by the U.S.-based Litchfield Company in Taiwan. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Electrical Appliances Industry Association also protested the tax-free import of large quantities of electrical products by the U.S. military in Taiwan. In early April, a so-called "Far East Agricultural Trade Mission" led by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture arrived in Taiwan to promote the sale of surplus agricultural products and was met with strong opposition from Taiwanese compatriots. Taiwanese compatriots pointed out that for many years, U.S. aggressors have dumped surplus agricultural products in Taiwan and exploited Taiwanese farmers through high-interest loans, causing the rural economy to collapse, with many farmers losing their land and living in extreme poverty. In late April, the U.S. sent the general manager of the U.S. Standard Fruit Company, Clifford, to Taiwan to investigate the production and sales situation of bananas. Taiwanese fruit industry representatives angrily questioned the Chiang clique about the clandestine activities of Clifford and his group in Taiwan's banana-producing areas. To resist the plunder by U.S. monopolistic capital, Taiwanese banana farmers and fruit traders expressed their determination to unite and jointly oppose U.S. imperialism's economic infiltration.

U.S. imperialism's intensified cultural infiltration in Taiwan has also aroused the anger of Taiwanese students and cultural figures. Recently, Taiwanese film industry professionals held a press conference in Taipei, angrily denouncing the Chiang clique for allowing a large number of American films and publications to enter Taiwan. They pointed out that these obscene and thieving American films and publications, on the one hand, spread extremely decadent "American lifestyles," seriously poisoning the minds and bodies of Taiwanese youth; on the other hand, due to the dominance of American and Japanese films in the market, many Taiwanese film industry professionals have lost their jobs, and the film industry is in a state of desolation and misery. Many Taiwanese film industry professionals have also repeatedly gone to the "Control Yuan" and "Executive Yuan" of the Chiang clique to demand the immediate cancellation of the import quota system for foreign films and to prevent American and Japanese films from entering Taiwan. Many Taiwanese students and cultural figures have also published articles in newspapers, angrily condemning the Chiang clique's pro-American, traitorous crimes and calling for resistance against U.S. imperialism's cultural infiltration. On April 18, 42 students from Taiwan's Pingmin Middle School jointly wrote a letter to a newspaper, condemning the American films shown in Taiwan and the songs broadcast by the Chiang clique's radio station as "vulgar and indecent, drunken and dreamy sounds," bringing about very serious consequences.

Incidents of Taiwanese compatriots punishing the despicable U.S. personnel in Taiwan have been occurring frequently. On the evening of January 26 this year, two Taiwanese youths armed with knives entered a building on Xinsheng North Road in Taipei, which was occupied by the U.S. military as "military dependents' housing," and severely injured two U.S. soldiers, Bote and Berry, who were molesting Taiwanese women. On the afternoon of December 6 last year, a Taiwanese youth riding a motorcycle jumped over the wall into the "residential area" of the U.S. military in Songjiang Village, Taipei. When a Chiang clique special police officer guarding the area was about to shout, the Taiwanese youth stabbed him six times, causing him to collapse.

Taiwanese compatriots, suffering under the water and fire of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang clique's fascist rule, have bravely fought against the U.S. aggressors and the Chiang clique's ruthless exploitation. According to Taiwanese newspapers, to resist the Chiang clique's secret police violence and extortion, Taiwanese compatriots killed or injured 103 Chiang clique secret police officers last year. On January 16 this year, more than 170 workers, after being arbitrarily dismissed by the Chiang clique's state-owned "Taipei Gas Company," gathered at the Taipei "City Government" to demand that the Chiang clique's "Mayor" Gao Yushu come out and explain why he ordered the forced dismissal of workers, scaring Gao Yushu into hiding indoors and not daring to show his face. On April 26, more than 20 industrial associations in Taiwan sent representatives to the "Executive Yuan," "Legislative Yuan," and "Control Yuan" of the Chiang clique to protest the additional business tax imposed by the Chiang clique. Taiwanese newspapers revealed that recently, in various parts of Taiwan, slogans and leaflets opposing U.S. imperialism's occupation of Taiwan and the Chiang clique's exploitation of Taiwanese compatriots have frequently appeared.

    美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治激起台湾各界人民强烈仇恨
    台湾同胞反对美蒋匪帮的斗争不断发展
    新华社二十七日讯　台湾同胞反对美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团血腥统治和残酷压榨的斗争，正在不断发展。
    美国垄断资本最近以更大的规模，象洪水猛兽似的侵入台湾，利用台湾的廉价劳动力和丰富资源大肆投资设厂，并且倾销商品和剩余农产品，对台湾进行经济掠夺。台湾民族工业和农业在美国垄断资本的严重打击下气息奄奄，激起了台湾农民和工商业人士的强烈不满。三月间，台湾地区造纸工业公会和台湾地区纸器工业公会，就多次派人到蒋匪帮“监察院”，强烈抗议蒋匪帮批准美国利通公司在台湾设厂制造纸箱。与此同时，台湾区电工器材工业同业公会也抗议侵台美军免税运进大批电器用品在台湾市场上兜售。四月初，由美国农业部长带领的一个所谓“远东农业贸易访问团”到台湾推销剩余农产品时，遭到了台湾同胞的强烈反对。台湾同胞指出，多年来，由于美国侵略者向台湾倾销剩余农产品和利用高利贷向台湾农民进行敲骨吸髓的剥削，使台湾农村经济日益破产，广大农民失去土地，生活极端贫困。四月下旬，美国还派美国标准青果公司总经理克里吉福带领一伙人到台湾刺探台湾香蕉产销情况。台湾青果业人士愤怒地质问蒋匪帮，克里吉福等一伙这次诡秘地来往台湾的香蕉产地，究竟搞了些什么勾当？为了反击美国垄断资本的掠夺，台湾种植香蕉的农民和青果销售商人士表示：要团结一致，共同反对美帝国主义的经济渗透。
    美帝国主义对台湾加紧文化侵略，也激起了台湾学生和文化界人士的愤怒。不久前，台湾电影从业人员在台北举行记者招待会，愤怒控诉蒋介石匪帮允许大批美国的影片、书刊侵入台湾。他们指出，这些诲淫诲盗的美国影片和书刊的入侵，一方面传播极其腐朽的“美国生活方式”，严重地毒害了台湾青少年的身心健康；另一方面由于美国、日本影片霸占了台湾市场，使台湾大批电影从业人员失业，电影界呈现一片凋零凄惨的景象。台湾许多电影从业人员还不断到蒋匪帮“监察院”、“行政院”等单位，要蒋匪帮立即取消外片进口配额享受制度，不准美、日影片进入台湾。台湾许多学生和文化界人士还纷纷在报刊上发表文章，愤怒谴责蒋介石匪帮的媚美卖国罪行，呼吁人们抵制美帝的文化侵略。四月十八日，台湾平民中学四十二个学生联名向报纸写信，谴责在台湾放映的美国影片中和蒋匪帮电台播出的歌曲，都是“庸秽不堪，醉生梦死的靡靡之音”，带来了十分严重的恶果。
    台湾同胞惩罚无恶不作的美国侵台人员的事件不断发生。今年一月二十六日晚上，两个台湾青年手持尖刀，进入台北市新生北路一座被侵台美军霸占为“军眷住宅”的楼房里，把正在污辱台湾妇女的美国兽兵包特和柏利杀得头破血流，气息奄奄。去年十二月六日下午五时许，一个骑摩托车的台湾青年，越墙跳进台北市松江一村侵台美军“住宅区”内，在这个“住宅区”当看家狗的蒋匪帮特务警察发现正要叫喊时，这个台湾青年拔刀向敌人连刺六刀，使他昏倒在地。
    处在水深火热中的台湾同胞，在反对美国侵略者的同时，对卖国贼蒋介石的法西斯统治和残酷压榨也进行了英勇的斗争。据台湾报纸透露，台湾同胞为了反抗蒋匪帮的特务暴行和横征暴敛，在去年一年里，杀死杀伤了蒋匪帮特务警察一百零三人。今年一月十六日，一百七十多名工人被蒋匪帮官营的“台北煤气公司”无理解雇后，集体前往台北“市政府”，要蒋匪帮“市长”高玉树滚出来，说明为什么下令强迫解雇工人，吓得高玉树躲在室内不敢露面。四月二十六日，台湾省二十多个工业团体也派出代表到蒋匪帮“行政院”、“立法院”、“监察院”等单位，抗议蒋匪帮加征营业税。台湾报纸透露，最近在台湾各地，还不断出现反对美帝国主义霸占台湾和蒋介石匪帮压榨台湾同胞的标语和传单。
