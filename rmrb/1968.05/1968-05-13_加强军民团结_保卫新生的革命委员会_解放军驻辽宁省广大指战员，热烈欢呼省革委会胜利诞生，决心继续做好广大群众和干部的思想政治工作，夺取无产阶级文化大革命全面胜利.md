The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Liaoning Province warmly applaud the birth of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee and are determined to continue to do good ideological and political work among the broad masses of people and cadres, and to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 12th: The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Liaoning Province, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Liaoning Provincial and Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committees, and joyfully hail another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and together with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of Liaoning Province, advance victoriously, continue to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The news of the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial and Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committees has greatly inspired the soldiers and officers stationed in Liaoning. In recent days, the soldiers and officers who are carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks have brought the news of victory to factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and islands, reporting the good news to revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and the broad revolutionary masses, and holding celebrations with them, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" a thousand times and ten thousand times.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." On this great day of celebrating the establishment of the Liaoning and Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committees, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers recall the two-year battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning, study Chairman Mao's great teachings, and feel particularly close. They deeply feel that in the past two years, our People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses, under the close care and leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have fought a sharp struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning. This completely proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's great and brilliant thesis. Now, we have achieved a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders and traitors within the Party, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, will not reconcile themselves to their failure and will inevitably make desperate struggles. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees. We must, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," redouble our efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and seriously study the new problems that have arisen in the movement, discover and support new revolutionary things, and vigorously follow the developing new situation.

The good soldiers of Chairman Mao, such as the class that Lei Feng was in before his death, the 1124 Heroic Collective, the unit that An Yemin was in before his death, the combat heroes Zhang Zhi Hui and Zhang Ji Hui, and the pilot squadron leader Xu Kai Tong, who shot down an American-made high-altitude reconnaissance drone and was awarded first-class merit, all expressed their determination to resolutely oppose right opportunism, right opportunist splittism, and right opportunist capitulationism, smash the right opportunist reversal of verdicts wind, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and together with the revolutionary masses of the entire province, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning, overthrow and disgrace them, and root out the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, Kuomintang spies, and hidden or infiltrated counter-revolutionaries, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees.

A ship sailing in the sea relies on the helmsman; a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers said in meetings and discussions that all our achievements and victories are gained under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers and officers expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We must believe that more than ninety percent of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be reformed." Strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and us, continue to do good ideological and political work among the broad masses of people and cadres. We must vigorously carry out activities to support the military and love the people, humbly learn from the masses, further do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work. We must seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

    加强军民团结　保卫新生的革命委员会
    解放军驻辽宁省广大指战员，热烈欢呼省革委会胜利诞生，决心继续做好广大群众和干部的思想政治工作，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利
    新华社沈阳十二日电　人民解放军驻辽宁陆海空军广大指战员，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，热烈庆祝辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会的光荣诞生，纵情欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步加强军民团结，和辽宁省广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众一起，乘胜前进，继续向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会成立的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了战斗在辽宁地区驻军广大指战员。连日来，担负“三支”“两军”任务的指战员们带着胜利的喜讯，纷纷到工厂、农村、机关、学校和海岛，向革命工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和广大革命群众报喜，并和他们一起举行庆祝集会，千遍万遍地纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在欢庆辽宁省、沈阳市革命委员会成立的大喜日子里，广大指战员回顾两年来辽宁无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，学习毛主席的这一伟大教导，感到分外亲切。他们深有体会地说：两年来，我们人民解放军和广大革命群众，在以伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀和领导下，同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在东北和辽宁的代理人的尖锐斗争，完全证实了毛主席这一伟大英明的论断。现在，我们已经取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，决不甘心于他们的失败，他们必然要作垂死的挣扎。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，保卫新生的革命委员会。我们要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，认真研究运动中出现的新问题，发现和支持革命的新事物，朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势。毛主席的好战士雷锋生前所在班、一一二四英雄集体、海军某部安业民生前所在连的指战员和战斗英雄郅顺义、张积慧，击落美制无人驾驶高空侦察机荣立一等功的空军某部飞行中队长徐开通等都表示，要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，和全省广大革命群众一道，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在东北、辽宁的代理人揭深批透，斗倒斗臭，把美帝、苏修、日本、蒋匪特务和隐藏的或混进来的反革命分子挖出来，保卫新生的革命委员会。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。广大指战员在集会和座谈中说，我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的领导下取得的，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。指战员们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的伟大教导：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，继续做好广大群众和广大干部的思想政治工作。要大力开展拥军爱民活动，虚心向群众学习，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作。要抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
