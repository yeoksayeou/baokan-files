Members Sing of the Red Sun (Two Poems)
Members of the Shopu Commune, Feidong County, Anhui Province, Yin Guanglan

	1
	The tall mountains and pines are the strongest,
	The commune's crops are the most prosperous,
	The red flags flutter, and songs are even more numerous,
	We sing loudly of the red sun.

	Chairman Mao is the red sun,
	With golden light shining in countless rays,
	The contemporary Lenin raises the red flag,
	The people of the world have a direction.

	"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman,
	Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."
	With our Chairman Mao at the helm,
	We dare to brave the knife mountains and fire seas.

	Chairman Mao is the red sun,
	Illuminating our hearts,
	Illuminating the downfall of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries,
	Illuminating the red flag flying across the world.

	2
	The wheat sprouts are green, and the rapeseed is yellow,
	The red treasure book is carried on the body,
	Quotations are posted by the ridges,
	Waves rise in the fields.

	"Grasp revolution, promote production,"
	Chairman Mao's teachings are remembered in our hearts.
	Everyone strives to be an Old Man of the Quanshui Mountains,
	The vast land is clad in new clothes.

	We vow to achieve double victories in revolution and production,
	Sending good news to the red sun.

　　社员歌唱红太阳（两首）
　　安徽省肥东县店埠公社社员　殷光兰
　　一
　　高山青松最坚强，
　　公社庄稼最兴旺，
　　红旗招展歌更多，
　　放声歌唱红太阳。
　　毛主席就是红太阳，
　　金光闪闪万道光，
　　当代列宁举红旗，
　　世界人民有方向。
　　“大海航行靠舵手
　　干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
　　有咱们毛主席掌大舵，
　　刀山火海全敢闯。
　　毛主席就是红太阳，
　　照得咱们心里亮，
　　照得帝、修、反完了蛋，
　　照得红旗天下扬。
　　二
　　麦苗青青菜花黄，
　　红色宝书带身上，
　　埂边插上语录牌，
　　田里掀起千层浪。
　　“抓革命，促生产”，
　　毛主席教导记心上。
　　人人争当老愚公，
　　万里大地穿新装。
　　誓夺革命、生产双胜利，
　　喜报寄给红太阳。
