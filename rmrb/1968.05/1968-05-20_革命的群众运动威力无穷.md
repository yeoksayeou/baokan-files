The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's May 16, 1966 Circular, which has now been issued for two years. The theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat proposed by Chairman Mao in the Circular have armed the proletarian revolutionary forces and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country. The revolutionary people of the entire nation have formed a surging revolutionary army, launching a fierce attack on the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and their agents in various places, digging out those extremely cunning, extremely vicious, and deeply hidden representatives of the bourgeoisie, and achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The place where Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, fought, Lan Kiao County, has also undergone earth-shaking changes in the past two years. Reviewing the two-year battle course, it fully proves that Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history" is an unshakable truth, and fully proves the correctness of Vice Chairman Lin's statement that "the people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." Reviewing the two years of victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we enthusiastically shout a thousand times: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the victory of the revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

In Lan Kiao, the broad proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses have long been engaged in fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres throughout the county who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in Lan Kiao County. The broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution," distinguished between friends and foes and right and wrong. They clearly distinguished who were the capitalist roaders within the Party and who were the revolutionary leading cadres. They united with the revolutionary leading cadres, always directing their spearheads at the handful of class enemies headed by Liu Shaoqi and their agents in Lan Kiao, defeating these class enemies thoroughly. In January 1967, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Lan Kiao, with one stroke, seized power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. This revolutionary action made the class enemies lose their souls and the revolutionary people raise their heads.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in Lan Kiao were unwilling to accept their doom and fiercely counterattacked the proletarian revolutionary forces. This handful of class enemies stirred up a counterrevolutionary restoration tide, adopting various despicable means to brutally suppress the proletarian revolutionary forces, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres in Lan Kiao. The proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in Lan Kiao who resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line were not overwhelmed by the class enemies. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, they united as one, waged a struggle against the class enemies, and crushed the class enemies' fierce counterattack, exposing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

October 30, 1967, was the glorious day marking the fifteenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the rural areas of Lan Kiao. On this joyous day, the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee was born in victory. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! This is a great victory for the revolutionary mass movement in Lan Kiao County!

Through the two-year struggle side by side with the broad proletarian revolutionary forces and poor and lower-middle peasants in Lan Kiao County, I have deeply felt the boundless power of the revolutionary mass movement. The revolutionary masses are my best teachers. Being with the masses makes one clear-sighted and brave, able to overcome any difficulty. I will definitely be a lifelong student of the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and forever be with the broad masses, advancing bravely along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao!

    毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动胜利万岁
    ——各地革命干部纪念《通知》发表两周年著文颂扬文化大革命的伟大胜利
  据新华社十九日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的时候，各地革命干部写文章热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。他们以自己的亲身体会，热情颂扬亿万革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中创造的丰功伟绩，欢呼在毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动好得很！下面是他们写的几篇文章。
    革命的群众运动威力无穷
    兰考县革命委员会主任　张钦礼
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，已经发表两年了。毛主席在《通知》中提出的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，武装了我国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众。全国革命人民组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在各地的代理人展开了猛烈的进攻，把那些极端狡猾，极端阴险毒辣，隐藏得很久，钻得很深的资产阶级代表人物挖了出来，使无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志生前战斗过的兰考县，在两年中也发生了天翻地覆的变化。回顾两年来的战斗历程，完全证明毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”这一伟大教导是颠扑不破的真理，充分证明林副主席“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”这一论断的完全正确。回顾无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的两年，我们千百遍地纵情欢呼：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动胜利万岁！
    在兰考，广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众同党内一小撮走资派，长期进行着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无限忠于毛主席的全县工人、贫下中农、革命的红卫兵小将和革命干部，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，向兰考县党内一小撮走资派发动了猛烈进攻。广大革命群众遵照毛主席的“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，分清敌我，明辨是非。谁是党内走资派，谁是革命领导干部，他们都分得清清楚楚。他们和革命领导干部结合在一起，始终把矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在兰考的代理人，把这一小撮阶级敌人打得落花流水。一九六七年一月，兰考无产阶级革命派，一举夺了兰考县党内一小撮走资派的权。这一革命行动，使阶级敌人丧魂落魄，革命人民扬眉吐气。
    但是，正如毛主席所指出的，“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。兰考党内一小撮走资派不甘心自己的灭亡，疯狂地向无产阶级革命派进行反扑。这一小撮阶级敌人掀起了一股反革命复辟逆流，采取各种卑劣的手段，对兰考的无产阶级革命派、广大贫下中农和革命干部，实行残酷的镇压。坚决捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的兰考无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农，并没有被阶级敌人所压倒，他们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，团结一致，同阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，揪出了党内一小撮走资派，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    一九六七年十月三十日，是伟大领袖毛主席视察兰考农村十五周年的光辉的日子。在这个大喜的日子里，兰考县革命委员会胜利诞生了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这是兰考县革命的群众运动的伟大胜利！
    通过两年来同兰考县广大无产阶级革命派和贫下中农的并肩战斗，我进一步深刻地体会到革命群众运动的无穷威力。革命群众是我最好的老师。和群众在一起就心明眼亮，浑身是胆，什么困难都能克服。我一定要一辈子做群众的小学生，虚心向群众学习，永远同广大群众在一起，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向奋勇前进！
