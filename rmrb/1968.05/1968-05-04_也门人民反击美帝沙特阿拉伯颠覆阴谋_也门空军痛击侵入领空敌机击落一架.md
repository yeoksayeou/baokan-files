Yemeni air force strikes down enemy aircraft invading its airspace, shooting down one plane

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Sana'a, the Yemeni newspaper "Revolutionary News" reported on April 28 that on the morning of the 27th, the Yemeni air force struck down a small group of Saudi Arabian aircraft that had invaded Yemeni airspace over Jauf, killing two American pilots.

According to reports from the Yemeni News Agency and "Revolutionary News," since April 24, U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries, with the participation of Britain, have hastily gathered many air combat personnel as well as U.S. and British military personnel to the Red Sea port of Kizan in Saudi Arabia near the northwestern border of Yemen. U.S. and British military personnel are training personnel in an attempt to carry out subversive activities against the Yemen Arab Republic.

The Yemeni News Agency reported on the 28th that the Yemeni armed forces have completely controlled the Baraf Mountain and Bab al-Zala, about 15 kilometers southwest of Marib. Thus, the key passage to the eastern region has been controlled by the Yemeni armed forces, and one of the channels used by the Saudi Arabian reactionaries to dispatch infiltrators has been blocked.
