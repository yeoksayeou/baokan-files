Friends from Congo (Brazzaville) warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the issuance of the epoch-making great document—the May 16, 1966 Notice of the CPC Central Committee—personally directed by Chairman Mao, and highly praise the great thought of Mao Zedong as the universal truth applicable to all.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, May 21st: Friends from Congo (Brazzaville) warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the issuance of the epoch-making great document—the May 16, 1966 Notice of the CPC Central Committee—personally directed by Chairman Mao, and highly praise the great thought of Mao Zedong as the universal truth applicable to all.

A Congolese (Brazzaville) friend named Davi said, the Notice personally directed by Chairman Mao is a great historical document. In this Notice, Chairman Mao Zedong solved the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, and raised Marxism-Leninism to a new stage.

He emphasized that Chairman Mao Zedong is the great leader and teacher beloved by the revolutionary people of the whole world, and is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era. The thought of Mao Zedong is the universal truth applicable to all. The thought of Mao Zedong gives great courage and strength to the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism, and to the people of the whole world who are striving for liberation. Therefore, we must strive to study the works of Chairman Mao and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Another Congolese (Brazzaville) friend named Mekin said, the May 16, 1966 Notice has great significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, preventing revisionists from usurping the leadership of the party and the state, and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and has extremely profound international significance.
