The "May 7th" Commune, composed of revolutionary teachers, students, workers, and designers from Tongji University, has resolutely implemented the "May 7th" directive of our great leader Chairman Mao. In the half-year practice of educational reform, they have achieved excellent results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A new social system must clear away the base of the old system in order to be established."

Using Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive as a guide, we are conducting a proletarian educational revolution to fundamentally end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. This is a great revolutionary transformation. It will inevitably encounter the desperate resistance of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary academic "authorities" they protect. At the same time, it will encounter various obstacles from old habits and forces. The struggle is extremely fierce and arduous. Only by fully mobilizing the masses and extensively and deeply carrying out the great criticism of the revolution can we thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, completely destroy the old educational system, and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, creating a brand-new proletarian educational system. At the same time, only by deeply carrying out the great criticism of the revolution can the new proletarian educational system, under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, withstand the trials and tests of class struggle storms, and continuously develop and improve.

China's great writer Lu Xun once said: "The struggle against the old society and old forces must be resolute, persistent, and uninterrupted, and attention must be paid to strength. The foundation of the old society is originally very solid, and the new movement cannot shake it without greater force. Moreover, the old society has good ways to make the new forces compromise, but it itself is never compromising."

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary youngsters who have made contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution should carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, uncompromisingly fight against class enemies and all old habits and forces, and also fight against bourgeois thoughts in their own minds. They should steadfastly implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive and his series of brilliant directives on the proletarian educational revolution. They must prevent slackening of fighting spirit and passive complacency, muster their strength, and continue to push the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

　　在革命大批判中前进
　　本报评论员
    由同济大学革命师生和工人、设计人员组成的“五·七”公社，坚决贯彻我们伟大领袖毛主席的“五·七”指示，在半年来的教学改革的实践中，取得了很好的成绩。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。”
    以毛主席的“五·七”指示为指针，进行无产阶级教育革命，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，这是一场伟大的革命变革。它必然会遇到党内一小撮走资派和他们所包庇的资产阶级反动学术“权威”的拚死抵抗。同时，还会遇到来自旧的习惯势力的种种阻力。斗争是十分激烈、十分艰巨的。只有充分发动群众，广泛地深入地开展革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，才能彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，创建崭新的无产阶级教育制度。同时，也只有深入地开展革命的大批判，新生的无产阶级教育制度，才能在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，经受起阶级斗争大风雨的锻炼和考验，不断地发展和完善。
    中国伟大的文学家鲁迅曾经说过：“对于旧社会和旧势力的斗争，必须坚决，持久不断，而且注重实力。旧社会的根柢原是非常坚固的，新运动非有更大的力不能动摇它什么。并且旧社会还有它使新势力妥协的好办法，但它自己是决不妥协的。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中立过功勋的无产阶级革命派和革命小将，应当发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，毫不妥协地同阶级敌人和一切旧的习惯势力作斗争，还要同自己头脑中的资产阶级思想作斗争，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的“五·七”指示和关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列光辉指示。要防止斗志松懈，消极麻痹的情绪，鼓足干劲，再接再厉，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
