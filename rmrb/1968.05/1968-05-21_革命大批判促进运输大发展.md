The revolutionary masses of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, under the strong support and enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army, faithfully implement Chairman Mao's great instructions. They are conducting a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They are focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production, achieving double victories in both revolution and production. Now, 80% of the railway bureau and its subordinate grassroots units have established revolutionary committees. The revolution is booming, and transportation production is thriving. Trains on all lines are running smoothly without obstruction, and cargo loading and unloading are continuous day and night. In April alone, the amount of timber, grain, and materials supporting agriculture increased by 50% to 200% compared to January. Each train on average pulls an additional 126 tons, and the speed increases by 1.7 kilometers per hour. The situation is excellent and getting better.

The Qiqihar Railway Bureau is located in the northeastern border of the motherland, serving as an anti-revisionist front. The influence of the old warlords, imperial Russia, Japanese puppets, Soviet revisionists, and the Kuomintang reactionaries is widespread and deeply harmful. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses took up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and overthrew the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, exposing the hidden class enemies. They set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism along the 3,000-kilometer railway line within the bureau. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they severely criticized the representatives of all class enemies, particularly Khrushchev, and thoroughly settled accounts with the revisionist line promoted by Khrushchev and his agents. They planted the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every position of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul," and "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party strongly opposed Chairman Mao's great teachings, advocating for "business first" and promoting "indicators first," attempting to change the socialist direction of the people's railway. For example, regarding what goods to load and in what order, they pursued so-called indicators without emphasizing proletarian politics. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses angrily exposed and denounced the revisionist enterprise line of "business first" and "indicators first" promoted by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses loudly proclaimed: "Railway transportation can only serve proletarian politics, there is no other way." They analyzed everything from a class perspective and considered proletarian politics in every aspect. Previously, light and floating goods like reeds and straw often did not get priority. During the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers unanimously agreed that transporting reeds and straw to make paper was to print and spread more of Chairman Mao's works, which was the greatest political task. Therefore, they prioritized the transportation of these goods, ensuring they were transported quickly and efficiently, thus guaranteeing the production of paper and the printing of Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be for the people's interests, not for personal or small group interests." However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party only talked about "economic results" and "profits first," thus neglecting the small stations scattered across the vast countryside, citing reasons like low volume, low income, and tight staffing to avoid handling cargo. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, deeply criticized the revisionist management ideas of "profits first." After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, following Chairman Mao's instructions on strengthening the alliance between workers and peasants, taking agriculture as the foundation, and supporting agriculture with various industries, they opened 21 business stations in remote rural areas within a few months. According to statistics from the Ke Li Che station alone, it saved the people's commune more than 10,000 yuan in transportation fees in one year.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "consider the overall situation" and to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the railway bureau practiced "neighborhood enmity," implementing "restrictions" and "blocks," completely ignoring mutual support and socialist cooperation. During the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses angrily denounced and criticized the various crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, actively developing socialist cooperative relationships with brother enterprises. In recent periods, they went to remote counties, towns, and villages that do not have railway access, working with the revolutionary factions of local road, water, bank, postal, and commercial departments to reform transportation service methods, forming a comprehensive transportation system, and significantly speeding up transportation.

    革命大批判促进运输大发展
    齐齐哈尔铁路局广大革命职工深入持久地开展革命大批判，革命、生产形势大好，在三千多公里铁路线上一片繁忙景象，装卸昼夜不停
    本报讯　齐齐哈尔铁路局广大革命职工在人民解放军的大力支持和热情帮助下，忠实地执行毛主席的伟大指示，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了革命、生产的双胜利。现在，铁路局及其所属基层单位百分之八十已经成立了革命委员会，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，运输生产蒸蒸日上，各线列车一直畅通无阻，货物装卸昼夜不停。仅今年四月份所装的木材、粮食及支援农业物资，即比一月份增加百分之五十到百分之二百，每趟列车平均多拉一百二十六吨，速度每小时加快一点七公里，形势一派大好，越来越好。
    齐齐哈尔铁路局是地处祖国东北边疆、反修前哨的一个铁路局。旧军阀、帝俄、日伪、苏修和国民党反动派在这里流毒很广，贻害很深。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，打倒了党内一小撮走资派，揪出了暗藏的阶级敌人，并在全局管内三千多公里的铁路沿线摆开了革命大批判的战场，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上，狠批了一切阶级敌人的总代表中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的修正主义路线，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍齐齐哈尔铁路局的每个阵地。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治是统帅，是灵魂”，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”而党内一小撮走资派却极力反对毛主席这一伟大教导，大搞“业务挂帅”，鼓吹“指标第一”，妄图篡改人民铁路的社会主义方向。例如对待装什么货，以及先装什么、后装什么的问题，他们一味追求所谓指标，从不突出无产阶级政治。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工愤怒揭发和声讨了党内一小撮走资派所推行的“业务挂帅”、“指标第一”等修正主义办企业路线。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，响亮地提出：“铁路运输只能为无产阶级政治服务，别无二路”。他们事事作阶级分析，处处从无产阶级政治着眼。过去象芦苇、草秸这类轻浮货物就常常排不上号。文化大革命中，革命职工一致认为，运送芦苇、草秸制纸，是为了多多印刷出版毛主席的宝书，传播伟大的毛泽东思想，是最大的政治。因此，毫不犹豫地摆在优先运输地位，运得快、运得好，有力地保证了纸张生产和毛主席著作印刷工作的胜利进行。
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。可是党内一小撮走资派只讲什么“经济效果”，大讲“利润挂帅”，因而一向对于分散在广阔农村的小车站，都以运量小、收入少、定员紧为借口，不办理货运业务。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，深入批判了“利润挂帅”等修正主义经营管理思想。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，按照毛主席关于巩固工农联盟、以农业为基础、各行各业都要支援农业的教导，在几个月内，就在偏僻农村开辟了二十一个营业站，仅据其中的克利车站统计，一年就给人民公社节省运搬费一万多元。
    毛主席教导我们“要提倡顾全大局”，要“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，而铁路局党内一小撮走资派则“以邻为壑”，实行“勒”、“卡”，根本不讲互相支援，不搞社会主义协作。在革命大批判中，广大革命职工愤怒声讨和批判了党内一小撮走资派的种种罪行，积极发展同兄弟企业的社会主义协作关系。近一个时期来，他们深入到不通火车的偏僻县镇、农村，同当地的公路、水路、银行、邮电、商业等部门的无产阶级革命派一起协商，改革了运输服务方法，组成了综合运输体系，大大加快了运输速度。
