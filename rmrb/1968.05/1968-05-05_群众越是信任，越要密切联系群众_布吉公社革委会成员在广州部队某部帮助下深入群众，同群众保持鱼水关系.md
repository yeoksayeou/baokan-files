The More the Masses Trust Us, the More We Must Stay Close to the Masses

Members of the Buji People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, with the help of a unit from the Guangzhou Military Region, have gone deep among the masses and maintained a close relationship with them.

From the many letters and visits from the masses, we see that we have not gone deep enough among the masses.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Buji People's Commune in Ba'an County, Guangdong Province, at the beginning of this year, there have been many letters and visits from revolutionary masses. Most members of the Revolutionary Committee have been busy answering phone calls, handling letters, and receiving visitors. The cadres from the Guangzhou Military Region's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team saw this situation and promptly analyzed it with the members of the Revolutionary Committee. They believed that the large number of letters and visits from the masses showed the high level of trust the revolutionary masses had in the Revolutionary Committee, but it also showed that we had not gone down to the grassroots enough. If we went down to the grassroots, the masses could face-to-face reflect their problems, and we could discuss and solve them together on the spot, so the masses would not have so many letters and visits.

After finding the cause of the many letters and visits from the masses, the cadres from the Propaganda Team organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The most fundamental change in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." Everyone realized that members of the Revolutionary Committee must go down to the grassroots to be heart-to-heart with the masses and become as close as fish and water; if we float on the surface, we will be estranged from the masses and become as distant as oil and water. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee decided, except for leaving one standing committee member on duty, the other eight standing committee members and fourteen committee members would all go to various production brigades. Standing Committee Member Yan Shubao packed his bag, crossed mountains and valleys, and walked over thirty miles to the mountain village of Shandixia Brigade, where he ate, lived, studied, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes together. In the process of "five together," he established a deep proletarian friendship with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants had nothing to hide from him and consulted him on everything. In the first five days Yan Shubao was in the brigade, he solved four specific problems for the poor and lower-middle peasants that needed to be solved by the Commune Revolutionary Committee.

From the masses being polite to us, we see that we have bureaucratic tendencies.

The cadres from the Propaganda Team believed that the attitude with which the members of the Revolutionary Committee went down was the key to whether they could be heart-to-heart with the masses. They organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." This made everyone realize that to be close to the masses, we must not have even a hint of bureaucratic tendencies and must always remember to maintain the character of an ordinary laborer.

Everyone had the correct understanding and strictly demanded of themselves. Originally, the responsible person of Caopu Brigade, Liang Chunsheng, had a deep class friendship with the revolutionary masses when he fought against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They talked and laughed freely with each other. After he became a member of the Commune Revolutionary Committee, once, when he returned from a meeting at the commune, he passed by Liang Tiansheng's house. Liang Tiansheng saw him coming and quickly offered him his high stool to sit on, and washed his cup again and again, pouring him hot water. Liang Tiansheng's actions made Liang Chunsheng think deeply. He felt that the masses being so polite to him showed that he had not maintained the character of an ordinary laborer and had bureaucratic tendencies. If he continued like this, he would become estranged from the masses and even go down the wrong path of suppressing the masses. From then on, Liang Chunsheng always, in everything, appeared in the attitude of an ordinary laborer and blended in with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Those who used to call him "Committee Member" now affectionately called him "Little Liang" again.

The more the masses consult us, the more we must consult the masses.

With the help of the Propaganda Team, the members of the Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses." Everyone unanimously realized that after the members of the Revolutionary Committee went down, whether the masses consulted us or we consulted the masses was a fundamental attitude and method of connecting with the masses.

Revolutionary Committee Chairman Huang Musheng, while working in the Caopu Brigade Daxi Production Team, once, the team leader Liang Gangfa, because the collective pigs had increased to more than fifty, needed materials to expand the pigsty, and came to consult him on whether he could cut down more than twenty pine trees. Huang Musheng thought: cutting down pine trees is not good for water conservation and will also have a bad influence on other production teams, but expanding the pigsty needs wood, which is a practical problem. What to do? He mobilized the masses to think of solutions and ideas. Everyone quickly came up with a good solution: except for cutting a few pines for the main pillars, the rest would all use the old wood that the community members temporarily did not need.

Huang Musheng learned a lesson from this incident. Afterwards, every time he went to a production team, he would put down his bag and visit every household, or go to the fields and work with the community members. When he found problems, he would discuss and solve them with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Once, he came to Baini Tang Brigade, and a community member told him: "Our brigade is too far from the commune health station, and it is currently the busy spring plowing season, so it would be good to have a doctor who doesn't leave." Huang Musheng thought: the commune only has a few doctors, how can they stay in one brigade for a long time? Can the commune health station help this brigade train a health worker? He told the masses about this plan, and the masses all agreed with this approach. Therefore, he discussed and researched with the health station, and in a very short time, trained a health worker, leaving a doctor who doesn't leave for Baini Tang Brigade. Huang Musheng deeply felt: "The more the masses consult us, the more we must consult the masses. Only in this way can we be closer to the hearts of the masses and better serve them."

The members of the Buji People's Commune Revolutionary Committee strictly demanded of themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings and blended in with the masses, which made the relationship between cadres and the masses more intimate than ever before.

### 群众越是信任，越要密切联系群众　布吉公社革委会成员在广州部队某部帮助下深入群众，同群众保持鱼水关系

　　群众越是信任，越要密切联系群众
　　布吉公社革委会成员在广州部队某部帮助下深入群众，同群众保持鱼水关系
　　从群众来信来访多，看出自己深入群众少
    广东省宝安县布吉公社革命委员会在今年年初成立以后，革命群众来信、来访很多。革委会的大部分成员也忙于接电话，处理来信，接待来访。广州部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队的同志看到这种情况，及时地和革委会成员一起作了分析，认为群众来信来访多，这说明广大革命群众对革委会的高度信任，但也说明我们下去得不够。如果我们深入基层，群众有了问题就可以面对面反映，和群众一起就地商量解决，群众的来信来访就不会有这么多了。
    在找到群众来信来访多的原因后，宣传队的同志又组织大家学习毛主席最新指示：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”大家认识到：革委会成员只有深入下去，才能和群众心贴心，成为鱼水关系；如果浮在上面，就会和群众心隔心，成为油水关系。于是，革委会研究决定，除留一名常委在家值班外，其他八个常委和十四个委员都分别下到各个生产大队去。革委会常委严树保打起背包，翻山越岭，步行三十多里来到位于山区的山下大队，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同办毛泽东思想学习班。他和贫下中农在“五同”中，建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。贫下中农对他无话不说，有什么事都和他商量解决。严树保下到队里的头五天，就为贫下中农解决了需要到公社革委会解决的四个具体问题。
    从群众对自己客气，看出自己有官气
    宣传队的同志认为，革委会成员以什么姿态下去，这是能不能和群众心贴心的关键问题。他们组织革命委员会成员学习了毛主席的“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，使大家认识到：要和群众心心相连，自己就不能有一丝一毫的官气，必须念念不忘保持普通劳动者的本色。
    大家有了正确的认识，就处处严格要求自己。原草莆大队负责人梁春生，过去和革命群众一道造党内一小撮走资派的反，彼此有深厚的阶级感情，说说笑笑，无拘无束。他当了公社革委会委员以后，有一次，从公社开会回来，路过梁天生的家，梁天生见他来了，赶忙把自己坐的高板凳让给他坐，还把口杯洗了又洗，倒上开水送到他跟前。梁天生的一举一动，引起了梁春生的深思，他觉得群众这样客气，正说明自己没有坚持普通劳动者的本色，有了官气。这样下去，就要脱离群众，甚至走到压制群众的歪路。从这以后，梁春生就时时、事事、处处以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和贫下中农打成一片。过去叫他“委员”的人，现在又亲热地叫他“小梁”了。
    群众越是向自己请示，自己越要请教群众
    在宣传队的帮助下，革委会的同志学习了毛主席“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，大家一致认识到：革委会成员下去以后，是要群众请示我们，还是我们请教群众，这是联系群众的根本态度、根本方法问题。
    革命委员会主任黄木生在草莆大队下屋生产队蹲点时，一次，生产队长梁庚发因为集体养的猪增加到五十多头，扩建猪舍需要材料，便来请示他是否可以砍二十多株松树。黄木生想：砍了松树对水土保持不利，对其它生产队也会带来不好的影响，但扩建猪舍需要木料又是实际问题。怎么办？他便发动群众想办法、出主意。大家很快就想出了好办法：除砍几根做正柱的松树外，其余全部利用社员暂时不用的旧木料。
    黄木生从这件事中受到了教育，以后他每到一个生产队，放下背包，就挨家串门，或到地里和社员一起劳动，发现问题，就和贫下中农商量解决。一次，他来到白泥塘大队，一个社员向他反映说：“我们大队离公社卫生所太远，目前又是春耕大忙，能来个不走的医生就好了。”黄木生想：公社只有几个医生，怎能长期放在一个大队？能不能叫公社卫生所帮助这个大队培养一个卫生员呢？他把这个打算告诉了群众，群众都赞同这种做法。于是，他就和卫生所商量研究，在很短的时间内培养了一个卫生员，给白泥塘大队留下了一个不走的医生。黄木生深有体会地说：“群众越是请示我们，我们就越要请教群众，这样才能和群众的心贴得更紧，才能更好地为他们服务。”
    布吉公社革命委员会的成员处处按照毛主席的教导，严格要求自己，紧紧和群众打成一片，这就使干群之间出现了前所未有的亲密无间的新气象。　本报通讯员
