Through two years of struggle and practice, we have come to a deeper understanding that if it were not for our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, our country would have changed color, and countless people would have lost their heads. We workers and peasants, who have suffered so much in the old society, would have to endure double the suffering.

Before the proletarian cultural revolution, a small clique of capitalist roaders in our Northwest No. 1 Cotton Mill pushed the "quota as the commander" and "material incentives" policies, spreading a capitalist management black wind, attempting to turn a socialist enterprise into a capitalist one. Worse still, this small clique of capitalist roaders, together with China's Khrushchev, fiercely opposed our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They did not allow us to post Chairman Mao's quotations. They maliciously said, "Studying Chairman Mao's works is 'empty,' only production is 'concrete.'" In reality, they used production as a cover, while their true intention was to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They were afraid that we workers would grasp Mao Zedong Thought. We workers must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice. We deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the working class. With the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will be invincible, and with its guidance, we will have the correct direction to move forward. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end.

"Grasp revolution, promote production" is the great policy put forward by our great leader Chairman Mao. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought resolutely carry it out and implement it in earnest. However, a small clique of class enemies are constantly trying to sabotage and resist this great policy of Chairman Mao. During the cultural revolution, this small clique of class enemies first used production to suppress the revolution. When their plot failed, they then used the banner of "revolution" to incite workers to stop production, attempting to sabotage production and the proletarian cultural revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. We resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" in our minds and actions. On one hand, we timely exposed the tricks of a small clique of class enemies together with the broad revolutionary masses; on the other hand, we took the lead in vigorously promoting production, with one person doing the work of two, and two people doing the work of three, thus smashing the class enemies' plot to sabotage the revolution and production.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat care most about the revolution and also about production. We understand that if we only focus on production without the revolution, production will lose its direction and may slide into the capitalist path. If we only focus on the revolution without promoting production, production will suffer losses, which will in turn affect the revolution. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, insisting on leading with the revolution, firmly grasping the class struggle as the key link, and continuously launching fierce attacks on a small clique of class enemies, promoting the great development of production.

After the revolutionary committee was established, a small clique of cunning class enemies saw that all their tricks had failed. They then used some workers' selfish thoughts and anarchist tendencies to spread rumors and stir up trouble, disrupting labor discipline and attempting to sabotage the cultural revolution. We immediately gave a powerful response, thoroughly crushing the class enemies' counter-revolutionary arrogance and greatly encouraging the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers, bringing about a great development in production. We must persistently implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, overcome rightist complacency, advance victoriously, and resolutely be models of grasping the revolution and promoting production, seizing the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    听毛主席的话，做“抓革命，促生产”的模范

    经过两年来的斗争实践，我们更深刻地认识到，如果不是伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我们的国家就会改变颜色，就会使千百万人头落地，我们这些在旧社会受尽欺凌的工人、农民，就要受二遍苦。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，我们西北国棉一厂一小撮走资派大搞“指标挂帅”、“物质刺激”，大刮资本主义经营黑风，妄图使社会主义企业变成资本主义企业。更恶毒的是，这一小撮走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫一个鼻孔出气，疯狂地反对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们不让我们贴毛主席语录。他们胡说什么“学习毛主席著作是‘虚’的，只有抓生产才是‘实’的”，等等。其实，他们抓生产是假，反革命是真。他们就是害怕我们工人掌握毛泽东思想。我们工人阶级就是要活学活用毛泽东思想。我们深深懂得，毛泽东思想是我们工人阶级的命根子。有了毛泽东思想的指引，革命就能无往不胜，有了毛泽东思想的指引，我们前进就有正确的方向。谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就要和他拚到底。
    “抓革命，促生产”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的伟大方针。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，坚决执行，切实照办。可是一小撮阶级敌人却每时每刻都在妄图破坏和对抗毛主席这一伟大的方针。在文化大革命中，这一小撮阶级敌人先以生产来压革命，当他们的这个阴谋破产以后，他们又打着“革命”的旗号，煽动职工停产，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政。我们坚决把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示落实在思想里，表现在行动上。我们一方面及时和广大革命职工一起揭露了一小撮阶级敌人的诡计；一方面带头猛促生产，一人顶两人，两人顶三人，终于粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命、破坏生产的阴谋。
    无产阶级革命派最关心革命，也最关心生产。我们懂得：如果只抓生产不抓革命，生产就会迷失方向，就可能滑到资本主义邪道上去；如果只抓革命，不促生产，把革命与生产对立起来，生产受损失，也会反过来影响革命。我们遵照毛主席的教导，坚持以革命带头，狠狠地抓住阶级斗争这条纲，不断地向一小撮阶级敌人主动发起猛烈进攻，促进生产大发展。
    革命委员会建立以后，一小撮狡猾的阶级敌人眼看自己的各种手段统统遭到失败，他们又利用一些职工头脑中的“私”字和无政府主义思潮，煽阴风，点鬼火，破坏劳动纪律，妄图破坏文化大革命。对此，我们及时地给予了有力的回击，大灭了阶级敌人的反革命气焰，大长了广大职工的革命志气，带来了生产大发展。我们一定要坚持不懈地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。一定要百倍提高革命警惕，克服右倾麻痹思想，乘胜前进，誓做抓革命促生产的模范，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
