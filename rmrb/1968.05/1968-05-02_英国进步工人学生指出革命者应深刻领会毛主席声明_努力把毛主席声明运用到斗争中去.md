British progressive workers and students enthusiastically hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They point out that this historic statement gives all oppressed and exploited peoples of the world a clear direction in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

A British worker recently told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that Chairman Mao's statement has great significance, especially at a time when the American blacks and the working class of the world are in a common struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and all exploitative systems and need the guidance of Marxism-Leninism.

He said, Chairman Mao pointed out that the oppressed peoples have common interests. American blacks can only liberate themselves by overthrowing the rule of monopoly capital, which means they must unite with all peoples who demand the overthrow of the exploitative system.

He said, Chairman Mao's statement is a great directive and inspiration for the British working class. He expressed that he would study and discuss this statement with his fellow workers in the factory and apply it to their struggle.

Another British worker wrote to Xinhua News Agency saying, "Chairman Mao's statement points out a clear direction for the workers of various countries, as well as other oppressed and exploited peoples."

He said: "All revolutionaries, workers, students, and progressives in Britain should deeply understand the call made by Chairman Mao in his statement, and then together with the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, form a powerful and unbreakable chain around the world to encircle American imperialism, which will surely deliver the final blow to the rotten imperialist system."

A group of progressive students in London recently issued a statement saying that Chairman Mao's statement clearly points out the class nature of the struggle of American blacks. "Indeed, the struggle of American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom by the oppressed blacks in America, but it is also an inspiring call to all laboring and oppressed peoples in America, and it is a great support and inspiration for the struggle of all peoples of the world against American imperialism." These students emphasized that all progressive peoples of the world must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's statement.

These students said in the statement, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which flourished with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will surely come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." Chairman Mao's words are very profound and inspiring. The oppressed peoples fighting all over the world are increasingly understanding the profound truth of this statement.

Many British friends also emphasized that Chairman Mao's statement is a powerful weapon against all kinds of revisionists, because the revisionists are advocating that the oppressed peoples should not use revolutionary violence to fight against counter-revolutionary violence.

　　英国进步工人学生指出革命者应深刻领会毛主席声明
　　努力把毛主席声明运用到斗争中去
    据新华社伦敦二十九日电　英国的进步工人和学生热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们指出，这个具有历史意义的声明，给全世界一切被压迫和被剥削的人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义制度的斗争指明了明确的方向。
    一位英国工人最近对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明具有重大的意义，特别是目前，当美国黑人以及全世界工人阶级在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和一切剥削制度的共同斗争中，需要马克思列宁主义指导的时候，尤其具有重大的意义。
    他说，毛主席指出，被压迫人民有着共同的利益。美国黑人只有推翻垄断资本的统治才能解放自己，这就是说，他们必须同一切要求推翻剥削制度的人民联合起来。
    他说，毛主席的声明对英国工人阶级也是一个伟大的指示和鼓舞。他表示，他将和厂内的工人兄弟一起学习讨论这个声明，并把声明运用到他们的斗争中去。
    另一位英国工人写信给新华社说，毛主席的声明“给各国的工人，以及其它被压迫和被剥削的人民指出了明确的方向。”
    他说：“英国所有的革命者、工人、学生和进步人士应当深刻领会毛主席在声明中发出的号召，然后同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命人民一起，在世界范围内结成一条强大的牢不可破的包围美帝国主义的锁链，它必将给腐朽的帝国主义制度以最后的一击。”
    伦敦的一批进步学生最近发表声明说，毛主席的声明明确地指出了美国黑人的斗争的阶级实质。“的确，美国黑人的斗争，不仅是美国被压迫的黑人争取自由的斗争，它对于美国一切劳动人民和被压迫人民也是鼓舞人心的号召，而且也是对全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的一个巨大的支持和鼓舞。”这些学生强调说，全世界一切进步人民必须反复学习毛主席的这个声明。
    这些学生在声明中说，毛主席指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛主席的这句话说得非常透彻、非常令人鼓舞，世界各地正在斗争中的被压迫人民，正在一天天地懂得毛主席这句话的深刻的真理。
    许多英国朋友还强调指出，毛主席的声明是反对形形色色的修正主义者的强大武器，因为修正主义者正在鼓吹被压迫人民不要用革命的暴力斗争去反对反革命的暴力镇压。
