The U.S. imperialists' control over India has taken a relatively covert and cunning form. They do not openly establish a governor's office in India, but rather mainly use their agents in India—the Indian reactionary ruling clique—to realize their neo-colonialist rule.

Funding Pro-American Candidates
Before the "Fourth General Election" in India, the U.S. had brazenly interfered. It invested a large amount of money to help pro-American candidates in their elections. In the previous "General Election," the U.S. spent 30 million rupees on the election campaign of an Indian feudal princess. During the "Fourth General Election," U.S. embassy officials, including the deputy chief of mission, traveled between New Delhi, Mumbai, and the Indian-occupied areas of Kashmir, engaging in behind-the-scenes activities to form the Indian central and local reactionary governments.

Buying Politicians to Act as Agents
The U.S. used the more than 20 billion Indian rupees it earned from dumping grain in India to mainly buy Indian politicians and leaders of political parties and organizations, making them openly or secretly act as U.S. agents. Not long ago, during a dispute among various factions of the reactionary ruling clique in the Indian Parliament, some members exposed that several government ministers had taken money from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. At the time, the then Foreign Minister Chagla had to admit that the "Freedom from Hunger Council," the "Delhi International Youth Center," and the "Indian World Youth Assembly" had received funds from the CIA.

Using "Supervision" as a Pretext to Infiltrate the Indian Military
According to the then commander of the Eastern Command, Kaul, who revealed that the U.S. ambassador to India had a close relationship with Indian senior generals during India's armed aggression against China in 1962. Even Kaul's resignation due to the failure of the aggression was decided after consulting with the then commander of the "U.S. Advance Command," Adams. After the U.S. provided military "aid" to India, it sent people deep into the Indian military under the pretext of "supervising" the use of U.S. materials. The secrecy of some revelations about the Indian military in U.S. newspapers shocked even Indian newspapers.

Sending "Scholars" and "Advisors" to Control Various Departments
The U.S. used its "scholars," "advisors," and "tourists" sent to India to infiltrate various departments of the Indian government, forming a vast control network and gaining access to many internal affairs of the Indian government. Last year, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Freeman proudly declared: "We contact the Indian government every day through the Indian Minister of Agriculture, ... I personally have a representative in Delhi working with the Indian government, reporting to me how the Indian government is implementing the plan announced in Parliament last December."

Using the "Peace Corps" to Engage in Dirty Deals
The so-called "Peace Corps" members sent by the U.S. to India, under the pretext of "helping India build," are engaged in unspeakable activities. An Indian newspaper recently exposed a secret memorandum issued by the U.S. government to the "Peace Corps" representative. It clearly instructed the "Peace Corps" members to "use every means and opportunity to strengthen those political figures and groups that support the ideals of the free world (referring to the international imperialism led by the U.S. — editor)." The memorandum instructed the "Peace Corps" members to use the communication facilities of the U.S. diplomatic and military forces to communicate with the headquarters in Washington.

### 美帝猖狂干涉印度内政

　　美帝猖狂干涉印度内政
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：美国新殖民主义者对印度的控制采取了比较隐蔽和狡猾的方式。他们不是在印度公然设立一个总督府，而是主要通过他们在印度的代理人——印度反动统治集团去实现新殖民主义的统治。
    出钱帮助亲美分子竞选
    在印度“第四届大选”之前，美帝就进行了猖狂的干涉。它投入大量金钱去帮助亲美分子竞选。在上届“大选”中美帝为一个印度封建王妃花的“竞选费”就达三百万卢比。在“第四届大选”中，美国大使馆参赞等官员奔走于新德里和孟买、克什米尔印度占领区等地之间，插手于拼凑印度的中央和地方反动政权的幕后活动。
    收买政客充当代理人
    美帝把它在印度倾销粮食所获得的二百多亿印度卢比，主要用来收买印度政客以及政党、社团的头目，使他们公开或暗中地成为美帝代理人。不久以前在印度议会上，反动统治集团的各派争吵的时候，就有一些议员揭发有几名政府部长拿了美国特务机关中央情报局的钱。当时担任外交部长的查格拉，不得不承认印度的“争取文化自由大会”、“德里国际青年中心”和“印度世界青年大会”接受了中央情报局的资金。
    以“监督”为名打进印度军队
    据印度反动政府在一九六二年向中国发动武装侵略时的东部军区司令考尔透露，美国驻印度的大使同印度的高级将领之间关系密切。连考尔由于侵华失败下台这件事，也是考尔同当时的“美国进击司令部”司令亚当斯商量后决定的。美帝向印度提供军事“援助”后，以“监督”美国物资的使用为名，派人深入印度军队中去。美国报刊上对印度军队内情的一些透露，其机密性之大使印度报刊都表示惊讶。
    派遣“学者”、“顾问”控制各部门
    美帝通过它派去印度的“学者”、“顾问”、“游客”，打进印度政府各个部门，形成了广大的控制网，掌握了印度政府的许多内情。美国农业部长弗里曼去年就曾洋洋得意地宣称：“我们通过印度农业部长每天同印度政府接触，……我个人有一个代表在德里同印度政府一起工作，向我汇报印度政府如何执行去年十二月在议会所宣布的计划。”
    利用“和平队”进行肮脏勾当
    美帝派到印度的所谓“和平队”队员，打着“帮助印度建设”的幌子，干着不可告人的勾当。印度报纸不久前揭露了美国政府发给“和平队”代表的一项秘密的备忘录。它明确指示“和平队员”“利用一切手段和机会加强那些支持自由世界（指美帝为首的国际帝国主义——编者）的理想的那些政治人物和集团”。备忘录指示“和平队员”利用美国的外交和武装部队的通讯设施同华盛顿总部联络。
