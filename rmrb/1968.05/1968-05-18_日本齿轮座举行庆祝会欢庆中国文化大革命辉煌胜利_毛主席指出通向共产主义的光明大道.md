Japanese revolutionary theater troupe Gear Theater held a celebration on May 15 in Yamaguchi City to commemorate the second anniversary of the May 16 Circular issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966. The event highly praised the great leader and teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, for developing Marxism-Leninism to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. It enthusiastically hailed the glorious victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Secretary-General Kazuo Hatagami of Gear Theater said in his speech that the May 16 Circular, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a great Marxist-Leninist document. He said that the Circular creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and put forward a complete set of revolutionary theories to prevent capitalist restoration in socialist China, thus pointing out the bright path to communism for the revolutionary people of the whole world.

Hatagami said that great Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can the international communist movement advance along the correct path, and can the people of various countries achieve victory in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles.

Hatagami said that the great practice of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has fully proved the correctness of the propositions put forward by Chairman Mao in the Circular. He said that under the guidance of the Circular, the Chinese people have exposed a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and have fought them down and exposed them, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Hatagami stressed that people all over the world warmly welcome the issuance of the Circular. The revolutionary leftists in Japan have drawn courage from the Circular and are resolutely fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and the Miyamoto faction of the Japanese Communist Party.

Members of Gear Theater, such as Fujikawa Natsuko, spoke, expressing their determination to further arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen their class struggle consciousness, constantly transform their bourgeois worldview, and establish a proletarian worldview. They vowed to struggle for the thorough smashing of bourgeois and revisionist literature and arts, and to build proletarian revolutionary literature and arts!

Representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch of the Japan Socialist Party attended the celebration and delivered speeches.

The artistic workers of Gear Theater, with deep feelings for Chairman Mao, performed revolutionary art programs such as "Our Red Sun in the Heart," which reenacted the moving scene of their audience with the great leader Chairman Mao last October, and "The Brilliance of Chairman Mao's Works." The celebration ended with all participants joining hands and singing "The Ship Needs a Helmsman."

    日本齿轮座举行庆祝会欢庆中国文化大革命辉煌胜利
    毛主席指出通向共产主义的光明大道
    新华社东京十六日电　日本革命剧团齿轮座，为纪念中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年，十五日在山口市举行庆祝会，高度赞扬无产阶级伟大导师毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到了毛泽东思想的崭新阶段，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌胜利。
    齿轮座干事长日笠世志久在讲话中说，毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义文献。他说，《通知》创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，提出了在社会主义中国防止资本主义复辟的一整套完整的革命理论，从而给全世界革命人民指出了走向共产主义的光明大道。
    日笠说，伟大的毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，只有掌握毛泽东思想才能使国际共产主义运动沿着正确的道路向前发展，使各国人民的反帝反修斗争取得胜利。
    日笠说，中国无产阶级文化大革命两年来的伟大实践完全证明了毛主席在《通知》中提出的论断的正确性。他说，中国人民在《通知》的指引下，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并把它们斗倒、斗臭，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。
    日笠强调指出，全世界人民都热烈欢呼《通知》的发表。日本革命左派从《通知》中吸取了勇气，坚决地同帝国主义、修正主义和日共宫本集团展开英勇的斗争。
    齿轮座的文艺战士藤川夏子等人讲话，表示要进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，加强阶级斗争观念，不断地改造资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，为彻底粉碎资产阶级文艺、修正主义文艺，建立无产阶级革命文艺而奋斗！
    日中友好协会山口县（正统）总部和日本社会党山口县总部负责人等出席了庆祝会并讲了话。
    齿轮座的文艺工作者怀着对毛主席深厚的感情，表演了再现他们去年十月受到伟大领袖毛主席接见时的动人场面的革命文艺节目《我们心中的红太阳》以及《毛主席著作闪金光》等。庆祝会在全体与会者手挽手高唱《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中结束。
