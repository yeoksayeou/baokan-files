Following the brilliant directive of Chairman Mao on May 7, Wulian County sets up battlefields everywhere to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. Over 400,000 revolutionary masses in the entire county, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are deeply and persistently engaged in revolutionary criticism and struggle, sweeping away the poisonous influence of counter-revolutionary revisionism. They have launched a more vigorous attack on a handful of class enemies in conjunction with local conditions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 7: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's directive on May 7, over 400,000 revolutionary people in Wulian County, Shandong Province, have actively thrown themselves into the surging tide of revolutionary criticism during the stormy Cultural Revolution, becoming courageous critics of the old world. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region; criticizing all the old ideas and consciousness of the exploiting classes such as feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. They are determined to sweep all the filth of the exploiting classes into the dustbin of history and turn the entire county into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In this county, no matter where you go, even in the deep mountains and valleys, you can see many ordinary commune members stepping onto the stage of revolutionary criticism. Shichang Commune has a production team in Liqiao Village, with only 13 households scattered along a six-and-a-half-mile deep valley. These poor and lower-middle peasants, who fled from famine and begged for food in the old society and came here to guard the mountains for the landlords, have never had anyone who could read and write in their generations. Now, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated this valley. The entire production team is a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and the commune members often criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They also report on revolutionary criticism to workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers and cadres who come from outside to visit and learn. These reports have deeply educated everyone.

Many old poor peasants, filled with hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, have thrown themselves into the revolutionary criticism. In Hongning Commune, Zhongcun Production Brigade, a 75-year-old old poor peasant named Feng Zhijie, upon hearing that the Chinese Khrushchev wanted to restore capitalism, was so angry that he gnashed his teeth. He often hobbled with his cane to the production brigade to participate in the meetings criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev has made him rejuvenated. He said, "As long as I have a breath, I will fight the Chinese Khrushchev to the end and will not let his evil plot to restore capitalism in China succeed."

In Jiejiaoguanzhuang Production Brigade of Jietou Commune, there is a children's squad composed of pre-school children. They, like adults, often use Chairman Mao's quotations to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. When asked who they are closest to, they all unanimously answer: Chairman Mao; when asked who they hate the most, they all clench their small fists and say: the Chinese Khrushchev.

Many housewives have also thrown themselves into the surging tide of revolutionary criticism. They are not afraid of being busy with housework and having low cultural levels, and they study Chairman Mao's works diligently to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev fiercely. Some women, while collecting and digging fertilizer, criticize the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "three autonomies and one contract" in fertilizer collection.

In the midst of the enthusiastic revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire county, in accordance with the characteristics of rural areas, have set up various battlefields for revolutionary criticism. In addition to relatively large and concentrated criticism meetings, there are also street criticism meetings, trough criticism meetings, field criticism meetings, construction site criticism meetings, and family criticism meetings. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are also powerful positions for revolutionary criticism. In addition to meetings, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire county also use big-character posters, small-character posters, blackboard newspapers, big-character criticism wall newspapers, and other forms to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. Many families have also set up columns for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The county revolutionary committee and the commune revolutionary committees also use methods such as projecting slides, holding cartoon exhibitions, and organizing propaganda teams to promote rural revolutionary criticism. Through various forms of revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has been greatly aroused, making the Chinese Khrushchev a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat him.

The revolutionary criticism in this county is closely linked, with a wide range and a certain depth. In nearly a year, all the production brigades in each commune have not only universally criticized the revisionist goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "extinction of class struggle," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives," but many brigades have also criticized the revisionist lines of building the Party, the military, and education, as well as the revisionist lines in rural scientific experiments.

The various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this county have deeply felt in the practice of revolutionary criticism that revolutionary criticism is a powerful driving force for all work and cannot be stopped for a moment. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres have expressed that they will read Chairman Mao's books for life, engage in revolutionary criticism for life, and do revolution for life.

A large number of vivid facts show that the deep development of revolutionary criticism has deeply touched people's souls and sparked a great revolution of repudiating selfishness and establishing public spirit in the depths of people's souls. When people criticize the "self" in their minds, they always elevate it to the height of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants feel that only by closely combining the criticism of selfishness with the criticism of revisionism can the criticism of revisionism be fierce, and the criticism of selfishness be deep.

Currently, the revolutionary committee of this county is leading the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to further launch a more vigorous attack on a handful of class enemies in conjunction with the local class struggle reality. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have learned Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and it is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and it is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Everyone realizes that class enemies will never be willing to accept their failure and must actively and uninterruptedly launch attacks on class enemies. After the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have raised their class struggle awareness, they have further exposed many sabotage activities of class enemies in stirring up trouble and creating splits during the Cultural Revolution, analyzed the new characteristics of class struggle in the new situation, and launched a powerful attack on class enemies.

Deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism has greatly promoted the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this old revolutionary base of Wulian County, and their spiritual outlook has undergone a tremendous change. They are determined to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's directive on May 7 and turn Wulian County into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　遵照伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示
　　五莲县处处摆战场狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
　　全县四十多万革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，肃清反革命修正主义流毒。结合本地实际，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻
    据新华社济南七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，山东省五莲县四十多万革命人民，在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，积极投入革命大批判的洪流，成为旧世界的英勇的批判者。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线；批判了封建主义、资本主义、修正主义等一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧意识。他们决心将一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水全部扫进历史的垃圾堆，把全县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    在这个县里，不论走到那里，甚至在崇山峻岭间的山村，到处可以看到许多普通的人民公社社员走上革命大批判的讲台。石场公社有一个李崮寨生产队，全队只十三户，分散居住在一条六里半长的深山沟里。这些在旧社会逃荒要饭来到这里给地主看山的贫下中农，祖祖辈辈没有个识字的。现在，毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照亮了这个山沟。全生产队到处是斗私批修的战场，社员们经常对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人进行革命的大批判。并且向外地来这里参观学习的工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员和革命干部，作革命大批判的报告。这些报告，使大家受到深刻的教育。
    许多老贫农，满怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的刻骨仇恨，投入了革命的大批判。洪凝公社中疃大队一个七十五岁的老贫农冯至节，一听说中国赫鲁晓夫要复辟资本主义，气得咬牙切齿。他经常拄着拐棍，赶到生产大队参加批判中国赫鲁晓夫的大会。对中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判，又使他焕发出了革命的青春。他说：“我只要有一口气，就要和中国赫鲁晓夫斗到底，不能让他在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋得逞。”
    在街头公社季家官庄大队，有一个由学龄前儿童组成的娃娃队，他们同大人一样，经常运用毛主席语录，对中国赫鲁晓夫展开革命的大批判。人们问起孩子们对谁最亲时，他们都异口同声地回答：对毛主席最亲；问他们对谁最恨，他们都会握紧小拳头说：对中国赫鲁晓夫最恨。
    许多家庭妇女，也投入了革命大批判的洪流。她们不怕家务忙、文化低，刻苦学习毛主席著作，狠狠地批判中国赫鲁晓夫。有些妇女在积肥、挖肥时，就肃清中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”反动谬论在积肥方面的流毒。
    在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判热潮中，全县广大贫下中农根据农村特点，设立了各种革命大批判的战场。除了有比较大的、集中的批判会外，还有街头批判会、槽头批判会、地头批判会、工地批判会、家庭批判会等。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，更是革命大批判的有力阵地。除去会议外，全县广大贫下中农还采用大字报、小字报、黑板报、大批判墙报等形式，对中国赫鲁晓夫进行革命大批判。许多家庭也办起来了斗私批修专栏。县革委会和各公社革委会，还用放映幻灯，举办漫画展览，组织宣传队等办法，推动农村的革命大批判。通过多种形式的革命大批判，大大调动了广大贫下中农的革命积极性，使中国赫鲁晓夫成了过街的老鼠，人人喊打。
    这个县的革命大批判，一环紧扣一环，批判的范围广，有一定的深度。将近一年来，全县各个公社的生产大队，不但普遍批判中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，许多大队还批判了修正主义的建党路线、军事路线、教育路线，以及农村科学实验中的修正主义路线。
    这个县的各级革委会和广大贫下中农，在革命大批判的实践中，深深地体会到，革命大批判是推动各项工作的强大动力，一刻也不能停止。许多贫下中农和基层干部表示，要读一辈子毛主席的书，搞一辈子革命大批判，干一辈子革命。
    大量生动的事实表明，革命大批判的深入发展，已经深深地触及了人们的灵魂，在人们的灵魂深处爆发了破私立公的大革命。人们在斗自己头脑中的“私”字时，总是把它提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度。广大贫下中农感到，只有把斗私和批修紧紧地结合起来，批修才能批得狠，斗私才能斗得深。
    目前，这个县的革命委员会，正在领导全县广大贫下中农，结合当地的阶级斗争实际，进一步向一小撮阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻。广大贫下中农学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”大家认识到，阶级敌人是决不甘心自己的失败的，必须主动地、不间断地向阶级敌人展开进攻。广大贫下中农的阶级斗争觉悟提高后，进一步揭露了阶级敌人在文化大革命中挑拨离间、制造分裂的许多破坏活动，分析了在新形势下阶级斗争的新特点，向阶级敌人发起了强大的进攻。
    深入持久地开展革命大批判，使五莲县这个革命老根据地的广大贫下中农的革命精神大大发扬，精神面貌焕然一新。他们决心沿着毛主席“五·七”指示指引的方向，把五莲县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
