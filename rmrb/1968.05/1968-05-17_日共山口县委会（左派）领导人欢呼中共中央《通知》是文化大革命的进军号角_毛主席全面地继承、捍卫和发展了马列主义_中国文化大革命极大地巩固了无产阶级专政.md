Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee (Leftist Faction) leaders recently spoke to Chinese reporters, enthusiastically hailing the two-year anniversary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Notice, personally drafted by Chairman Mao on May 16, 1966.

Fukuda Seigyo said, two years ago, Chairman Mao personally drafted this historic document, which served as the battle cry for the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. The Notice pointed out that the principal contradiction in socialist conditions is between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The main targets of the revolution are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Under the guidance of the Notice, the Chinese people have resolutely fought against this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and achieved great victories.

Fukuda pointed out: The Notice sharply points out to the proletariat and all revolutionary people around the world that the most fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The proletariat has everything with power and loses everything without it. Once the proletariat seizes power, it must spare no effort to consolidate it. This is the most fundamental issue. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, this is a political revolution.

Fukuda said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the most vivid example of the unity of Marxism-Leninism theory and practice. Chairman Mao has solved the problem of preventing capitalist restoration after the proletariat seizes power, both theoretically and practically. He has shown the revolutionary people of the world the bright prospect of advancing towards communism and has thoroughly smashed the conspiracies and tricks of modern revisionists who create the illusion of fake socialism.

Fukuda pointed out: Today, Beijing has become the center of the world proletarian revolution. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China, with a quarter of the world's population, has become a strong bastion for the revolutionary people of the world. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is not only related to the fate of China but also to the fate of the world proletariat. The great impact of this revolution on the world revolution and the Japanese revolution is immeasurable. The great victory of this cultural revolution has boosted the confidence of the Japanese people in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. Under the influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been further spread in Japan. He said, in Yamaguchi Prefecture, a new generation of youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly growing.

Kokaya Shoichiro said: The Notice is a great programmatic document of Marxism-Leninism. This document declares the failure of the revisionist line pursued by the Chinese Khrushchev. This document has provided a powerful ideological weapon for the anti-revisionist struggle of the Japanese revolutionary people.

Kokaya said, Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The proletarian cultural revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This is Chairman Mao's highest and most scientific summary and generalization of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

Anakoya Takayuki enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao for fully inheriting, defending, and developing the Marxist-Leninist theory on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. He said, Chairman Mao has scientifically and dialectically analyzed socialist society, pointing out that class and class struggle exist in socialist society. Chairman Mao has solved the problem of carrying the socialist revolution to the end under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, both theoretically and practically. This is an important sign that Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to its contemporary highest level.

Anakoya said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a fierce struggle to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao against the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, with great historical significance, is the continuation and development of the struggle between the two lines within the Communist Party of China under new conditions.

Sumikata Takaharu pointed out that the series of wise judgments made in the great historic document, the Notice, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, have thoroughly smashed the fallacies spread by modern revisionists that there is no class and class struggle in socialist society.

Sumikata said: The brilliant victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution marks the beginning of a new stage in the world revolution. This revolution has greatly encouraged the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world and has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries.

Sumikata, in his speech, sincerely wished the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

    日共山口县委会（左派）领导人欢呼中共中央《通知》是文化大革命的进军号角
    毛主席全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马列主义
    中国文化大革命极大地巩固了无产阶级专政
    新华社东京十五日电日本共产党山口县委员会
  （左派）领导人最近向中国记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    福田正义说，两年前，毛主席亲自主持制定的这个历史文件，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号角。《通知》指出了在社会主义条件下的主要矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。革命的主要对象是混进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。中国人民在《通知》的指引下，同党内一小撮走资派进行坚决的斗争，并取得了伟大胜利。
    福田指出：《通知》向全世界无产阶级和一切革命人民尖锐地指出了革命的最根本的问题是政权问题。无产阶级有了政权就有了一切，丧失了政权就丧失了一切。无产阶级一旦夺取了政权，就必须竭尽全力巩固政权，这是最根本的根本。中国无产阶级文化大革命极大地巩固了无产阶级专政的政权。因此这是一场政治大革命。
    福田说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命是马克思列宁主义的理论与实践统一的最活的典范。毛主席从理论和实践上解决了无产阶级在夺取政权以后，防止资本主义复辟的问题，给全世界革命人民指出了走向共产主义的光明前景，并彻底地粉碎了现代修正主义者制造的假社会主义的阴谋诡计。
    福田指出：今天北京已经成了世界无产阶级革命的中心。在毛主席领导下，拥有世界人口四分之一的中国，成为世界革命人民的坚强堡垒。中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅关系到中国的命运，也关系到世界无产阶级的命运。这场大革命对世界革命和日本革命发生的伟大影响是不可估量的。这场文化大革命的伟大胜利，增强了日本人民反帝反修的信心。在中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，毛泽东思想在日本得到了进一步的传播。他说，在山口县用毛泽东思想武装起来的新的青年，正在迅速成长。
    古谷庄一郎说：《通知》是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文献。这个文献宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线的破产。这个文献给了日本革命人民的反修斗争以强大的思想武器。
    古谷说，毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这是毛主席对中国无产阶级文化大革命的最高度的、科学的概括和总结。
    穴迫隆之热烈赞扬毛主席全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。他说，毛主席对社会主义社会进行了科学的、辩证的分析，指出了社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争。毛主席从理论上和实践上解决了在无产阶级专政条件下，把社会主义革命进行到底的问题。这是毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到当代最高水平的重要标志。
    穴迫说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场反对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的激烈的斗争。正如毛主席所指出：
  “不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”中国无产阶级文化大革命这一具有伟大历史意义的斗争，是中国共产党内两条路线的斗争在新条件下的继续和发展。
    隅冈隆春指出，毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大历史文件《通知》所作出的一系列英明论断，彻底粉碎了现代修正主义散布的在社会主义社会里没有阶级和阶级斗争的谬论。
    隅冈说：中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，标志着世界革命进入了一个新阶段。这场大革命大大地鼓舞了全世界无产阶级和各国革命人民，沉重地打击了美帝、苏修和各国反动派。
    隅冈在谈话中衷心祝愿世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
