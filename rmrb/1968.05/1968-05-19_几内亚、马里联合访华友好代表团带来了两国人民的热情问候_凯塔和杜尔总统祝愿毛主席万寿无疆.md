The joint delegation from Guinea and Mali, visiting China as friends, brought warm greetings from the peoples of the two countries. Presidents Keita and Touré wished Chairman Mao eternal life.

On the evening of May 18, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Li Xiannian hosted a banquet to warmly welcome the delegation led by Mali's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ousmane Ba, and Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lansana Beavogui.

The banquet was filled with a spirit of unity and friendship. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui both spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Guinea, Mali, and China have all suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, and we have all fought long-term anti-imperialist struggles. Now, our three peoples face a common enemy, American imperialism. As our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out, 'We are all on the same front, and we need to unite and support each other.' I am deeply convinced that this visit by your delegation will greatly contribute to further strengthening our anti-imperialist combat unity."

He said, "Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Guinea, Mali, our state relations have developed greatly on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. I express my gratitude to President Sekou Toure and President Modibo Keita for their contributions in developing friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea, Mali."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, when talking about the excellent revolutionary situation in Africa, said, "A new upsurge in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people is coming. He praised Mali and Guinea for their consistent strong support for the cause of African peoples' unity against imperialism, and the two sister countries are further strengthening their cooperation in the common cause of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism."

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out, "Not long ago, our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong issued a statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. This statement deeply exposes the evil nature of colonialism and imperialism, calling on 'all the peoples of the world to unite more closely, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism and its accomplices!' Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great support for the liberation struggle of American blacks but also a great support for the liberation struggle of the African people."

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out, "Now, American imperialism is having a harder time. He said, on May 8, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism in Vietnam, strengthening the war on one hand and creating the 'peace talks' fraud on the other, and once again called on the Vietnamese military and people to 'carry forward the spirit of decisive battle and victory,' 'overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, continue to fight, launch extensive attacks, and win greater new victories.' We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will persist in a protracted war and will surely win the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. When talking about the Middle East issue, he pointed out that the American-Israeli aggressors will suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the persistent resistance of the Arab people."

Vice Premier Chen Yi then pointed out that recently, while the entire capitalist world is experiencing unprecedented serious currency, financial, and economic crises, in the United States and Western Europe, an unprecedentedly powerful student movement and workers' struggle have erupted. This is an important sign that the people in the heart of capitalism are becoming increasingly aware, a prominent manifestation of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie, and a major symbol of the more profound and intense great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization within the capitalist world. All this fully proves what our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong said, "The general trend of the international situation is that 'the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day.'"

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned the modern revisionist group for using a two-faced policy of fake support and real betrayal, attempting to extinguish the flames of armed struggle of the peoples of Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Asia-Africa-Latin America regions, supporting American suppression of blacks, maliciously attacking workers' and students' movements in Western Europe and North America, and openly defending imperialism and reactionaries in various countries. He said, "Their actions only expose their traitorous faces and accelerate their doom."

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed his heartfelt thanks to the peoples of Guinea, Mali, Africa, and the world for their enthusiastic support and encouragement of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more powerfully support the struggle of the African people and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, and better fulfill our internationalist duties."

Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui spoke on behalf of the delegation. He said, "The fraternal and enthusiastic reception given to the delegation by the Chinese people once again shows that the friendly relations between Mali, Guinea, and China are constantly developing. We bring the warm and fraternal greetings of the peoples of Guinea and Mali and Presidents Modibo Keita and Sekou Toure to the Chinese people and their great leader Chairman Mao. He said, Keita and Touré wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

He said, "Now, China is carrying out an unprecedented movement, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong. This movement is achieving new victories day by day. The delegation is happy to be able to visit China at this time and see this great event that has shocked the world with their own eyes. We believe that we will gain great and meaningful education from this visit."

He said, "The dispatch of a joint delegation by Mali and Guinea to visit China shows that there is a very good brotherly relationship between Mali and Guinea. The peoples of Guinea and Mali are opposed to imperialism and old and new colonialism and are determined to achieve African unity."

He said, "Africa is now experiencing an inspiring historical stage. In this stage, cleansing will bring progress because everything is becoming clear: the line between those who truly fight for the happiness of the African people and the dying imperialist old henchmen is clear. He emphasized that only after the African continent is completely freed from foreign shackles, African unity can truly be realized and sustained."

He said, "Mali and Guinea regard the struggle of the peoples of Mozambique, Angola, Southwest Africa, Guinea-Bissau, Rhodesia, and other countries as their own struggle. We two countries condemn and will forever oppose the vicious apartheid system being widely implemented by the South African racists. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. We are deeply convinced that the struggle of the peoples of all these countries will surely win."

He said, "Guinea and Mali regard the struggle of the peoples of all countries against their common enemy as their own struggle. We unreservedly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and the Palestinian people."

The speeches by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui were met with enthusiastic applause.

Leaders from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, as well as representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in the capital, attended the banquet.

Members of the delegation: Guinea's Ambassador to China, Sekou Camara, Mali's Acting Charge d'Affaires at the Embassy in China, Koulibaly, other diplomatic officials from the embassies of Guinea and Mali in China, and envoys from African and Arab countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Before the banquet, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian met with the entire delegation and had a friendly and cordial conversation with them.

On May 18, the joint delegation from Guinea and Mali, visiting China as friends, led by Mali's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ousmane Ba, and Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lansana Beavogui, arrived in Beijing by plane at the invitation of the Chinese government.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, and more than a thousand revolutionary masses in the capital went to the capital airport to warmly welcome the friends from Guinea and Mali.

Today, the sky above the capital airport was flying the national flags of China, Guinea, and Mali. The airport was filled with a spirit of unity and friendship between China and Africa. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of President Touré and President Keita, and banners with slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China, Guinea, and Mali!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the African people!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" and others, waiting at the airport for the friends from Guinea and Mali.

After Minister Ousmane Ba and Minister Lansana Beavogui and other members of the delegation got off the plane, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Premier Li Xiannian warmly shook hands with them. A team of Red Guards went up to present the delegation with the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read a quotation from Chairman Mao:

"We have a common enemy, American imperialism. We are all on the same front. We need to unite and support each other."

Minister Ousmane Ba and Minister Lansana Beavogui, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, then walked towards the welcoming crowd. As they circled the field, the cheers and drumbeats at the airport resonated together. The Red Guards presented the friends from Guinea and Mali with shining red Chairman Mao badges. The welcoming crowd waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!" "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation!" "Firmly support the struggle of American blacks against violence!" "Down with imperialism headed by the United States!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and others. The friends from Guinea and Mali waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and cordially greeted the welcoming crowd.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included leaders from various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, such as Ji Pengfei, Wen Yuzeng, Xie Huai, Guo Lu, and Ding Guoyi, as well as representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing.

Guinea's Ambassador to China, Sekou Camara, Mali's Acting Charge d'Affaires at the Embassy in China, Koulibaly, other diplomatic officials from the embassies of Guinea and Mali in China, and envoys from various countries in China also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

    几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团带来了两国人民的热情问候
    凯塔和杜尔总统祝愿毛主席万寿无疆
    陈毅、李先念副总理热烈欢宴代表团。陈毅副总理赞扬马里和几内亚一贯地大力支持非洲各国人民团结反帝事业；感谢对我国无产阶级文化大革命的支持；坚信越南人民在胡志明主席领导下坚持持久抗战，必能赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利；指出美以侵略者在阿拉伯人民持久抗战面前，必将遭到可耻失败；强烈谴责现代修正主义集团用假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策，妄图扑灭越南、中东以及亚非拉地区人民武装斗争烈火的叛徒行径
    新华社十八日讯　国务院副总理陈毅、李先念今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由马里外交部长乌斯曼·巴和几内亚外交部长兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉率领的几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团。
    宴会上洋溢着团结友好的气氛。陈毅副总理和兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉外长先后在宴会上讲话。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，几内亚、马里同中国，都曾遭受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫，我们都曾进行过长期的反帝斗争。现在，我们三国人民，都面对着一个共同的敌人美帝国主义。正如中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席所指出的，“我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结互相支持。”我深信，这次贵宾们来访，必将对进一步加强我们反帝的战斗团结，作出巨大的贡献。
    他说，中国和几内亚、马里自建交以来，我们的国家关系在和平共处五项原则的基础上得到了巨大的发展。他对塞古·杜尔总统和莫迪博·凯塔总统在发展中国同几内亚、马里的友好合作关系方面所作出的贡献，表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理在谈到非洲的大好革命形势时说，非洲人民反帝革命斗争的新高潮正在到来。他赞扬马里和几内亚一贯地大力支持非洲各国人民团结反帝的事业，以及这两个姊妹国家在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同事业中正在进一步紧密地合作。
    陈毅副总理指出，不久以前，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。这个声明深刻地揭示了殖民主义、帝国主义制度的罪恶本质，呼吁“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”毛主席的声明不仅是对美国黑人解放斗争的巨大支持，也是对非洲人民解放斗争的巨大支持。
    陈毅副总理指出，现在，美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。他说，五月八日，越南民主共和国胡志明主席揭露了美帝国主义在越南一面强化战争、一面制造“和平谈判”骗局的阴谋，并且再一次号召越南军民“发扬决战决胜的精神”，“克服一切艰苦，不怕任何牺牲，连续地打，广泛出击，夺取更大的新胜利。”我们相信，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，坚持持久抗战，必能赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。他在谈到中东问题时指出，美以侵略者在阿拉伯人民持久抗战的面前，必将遭到可耻的失败。
    陈毅副总理接着指出，最近，正当整个资本主义世界经历着空前严重的货币、金融危机和经济危机的时候，在美国和西欧地区，掀起了规模空前强大的学生运动和工人斗争。这是资本主义心脏地区的人民正在日益觉醒的一个重要标志，是国际垄断资产阶级反动统治日益不稳的一个突出表现，也是资本主义世界内部大动荡、大分化、大改组更加深刻剧烈的一个重大象征。这一切，完全证实了中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说的，国际形势的总的特点是，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中强烈谴责现代修正主义集团用假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策，妄图扑灭越南、中东以及亚非拉地区人民武装斗争的烈火，支持美帝对黑人的镇压，恶毒攻击西欧北美的工人运动和学生运动，公然为帝国主义和各国反动派张目。他说，它们这样做，只能更加暴露它们的叛徒面目，加速它们的灭亡。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中，表示衷心地感谢几内亚、马里、非洲和全世界人民，对我国无产阶级文化大革命所给予的热烈的支持和鼓舞。他说，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更有力地支持非洲人民和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，更好地完成我们的国际主义义务。
    兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉部长代表代表团讲话。他说，中国人民给予代表团兄弟般的、热情的接待，再次表现了马里、几内亚和中国之间的友好关系在不断地向前发展。我们带来了几内亚、马里人民和莫迪博·凯塔总统、塞古·杜尔总统对中国人民及其伟大领袖毛主席热情的、兄弟般的问候。他说，凯塔和杜尔总统祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    他说，现在中国正在进行史无前例的运动，即毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。这一运动正日益取得新的胜利。代表团为能在这个时候前来中国访问，亲眼看看这一震动全世界的伟大事件而感到高兴。我们相信将从访问中获得具有伟大意义的教育。
    他说，马里和几内亚两国派遣联合代表团访问中国，表明马里、几内亚之间有着很好的兄弟关系。几内亚、马里人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，决心实现非洲统一。
    他说，非洲正经历着一个令人鼓舞的历史阶段。在这个阶段里，清洗会带来进步，因为一切都在明朗化：真正为非洲人民幸福而斗争的战士同垂死的帝国主义的老牌走狗之间的界限清楚了。他强调指出，只有非洲大陆完全从外国桎梏下解放出来以后，非洲统一才能真正实现并存在下去。
    他说，马里和几内亚把莫三鼻给、安哥拉、西南非、几内亚（比绍）、罗得西亚等国人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争。我们两国谴责并且永远反对南非种族主义者大肆推行的万恶的种族隔离制度。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。我们深信，所有这些国家的人民的斗争一定会取得胜利。
    他说，几内亚、马里把世界各国人民反对共同敌人的斗争，看作是自己的斗争，我们无保留地支持越南人民和巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理和兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉外长的讲话博得了热烈的掌声。
    政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会负责人，以及首都革命群众组织代表参加了宴会。
    代表团团员：几内亚驻我国大使塞古·卡马拉、马里驻中国大使馆临时代办库里巴利，几内亚和马里驻中国大使馆的其他外交官员，非洲和阿拉伯国家驻中国使节应邀出席了宴会。
