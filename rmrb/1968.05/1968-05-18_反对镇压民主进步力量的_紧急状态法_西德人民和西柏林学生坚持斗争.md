The mass movement against the "Emergency Powers Act" proposed by the West German ruling clique, aimed at suppressing and strangling democratic and progressive forces, continues to flourish among the people of West Germany and residents of West Berlin.

Students from universities and secondary schools across West Germany, as well as university students in West Berlin, held strikes, protests, and demonstrations on May 15 to strongly protest the West German parliament's discussion of the "Emergency Powers Act."

In Frankfurt, West Germany, over a thousand university students began a strike early on May 15. Their just actions were supported by workers and secondary school students. More than ten thousand workers from over thirty factories in Frankfurt held a warning strike. Many workers and secondary school students went to Frankfurt University to participate in the students' discussion meeting. Speakers at the meeting strongly protested the "Emergency Powers Act."

In the afternoon, students formed many propaganda teams to march through the city. Many workers, employees, and secondary school students voluntarily joined their ranks. Some propaganda teams quickly expanded to over five thousand people. Demonstrating students also received many telegrams of support from workers.

A social organization in Frankfurt issued a call on May 15, urging the strengthening of the struggle against the "Emergency Powers Act." The call proposed making May 29, the day the West German Federal Parliament is scheduled to finally pass the "Emergency Powers Act," the "Day of Total Protest Against the 'Emergency Powers Act'." The call urged a total strike and total work stoppage on that day.

Over sixteen hundred students at the University of Hamburg held a meeting on the evening of May 14 to protest the "Emergency Powers Act" and held a warning strike on May 15.

In Nuremberg, over two thousand university and secondary school students held a demonstration march in the city center on May 15. Many demonstrators sat on the city's tram tracks to protest, causing city traffic to come to a standstill.

Similar protest activities were also held in Bonn, Munich, Dusseldorf, Boppard, Bremen, and other places.

In West Berlin, over two thousand university students held a meeting to condemn the "Emergency Powers Act." Some professors also participated in the meeting. University students also performed a street play opposing the "Emergency Powers Act."
