The great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously award Comrade Men He with the honorable title of "A good cadre loyal to the limit to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The order calls on all military personnel to learn from Comrade Men He's limitless loyalty to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

New China News Agency, May 27th: Our most respected great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously award Comrade Men He with the honorable title of "A good cadre loyal to the limit to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," and to call on all military personnel to learn from Comrade Men He.

The order states, Deputy Political Instructor Men He of the Fourth Regiment, Second Battalion of a certain unit of the Qinghai Provincial Military Region, on September 5, 1967, while carrying out the task of supporting the left in the Baqiang Farm, firmly responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." Together with the revolutionary masses, he set up soil rockets to disperse clouds and prevent hail, protecting production. During the setup of the soil rockets, the explosives unexpectedly detonated. Comrade Men He, to protect the lives of the 27 class brothers present, threw himself onto the explosives, sacrificing his own life gloriously.

The order states, Comrade Men He, born into a poor peasant family, has been participating in the revolution for twenty years, consistently loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He studied Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness, insisting on learning and applying them in practice. In the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, he consistently stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely counterattacking the frenzied assaults of the rightists, bravely exposing the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism with his "three selfs and one package," and effectively resisting the bourgeois military line of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly supporting the revolutionary leftists, achieving remarkable results. He always maintained close ties with the masses, loving the masses limitlessly, and on many occasions, he fearlessly risked his life to save others, fully demonstrating the noble spirit of communism. Comrade Men He, with his brilliant life, fulfilled his vow: always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao.

The order states, to commend Comrade Men He's limitless loyalty to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he is posthumously awarded the honorable title of "A good cadre loyal to the limit to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." The order calls on all military personnel to learn from Comrade Men He. Learn from his limitless loyalty to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; learn from his revolutionary spirit of resolutely executing and defending to the death Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from his eager study of Chairman Mao's works, insisting on learning and applying them in practice; learn from his communist style of "never seeking personal gain, always seeking the benefit of others"; learn from his close ties with the masses, always maintaining the simple and frugal character of the working people. All military personnel should raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, achieve new merits for the people.
