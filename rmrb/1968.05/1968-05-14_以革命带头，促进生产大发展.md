Promote production through revolution is the consistent guiding principle of our great leader Chairman Mao. Leading with revolution to promote a great leap in production is an important aspect of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of our country's productive forces."

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is fundamentally changing people's spiritual outlook. The socialist enthusiasm for production hidden within the masses is erupting like a volcano, continuously driving industrial and agricultural production to new heights. The revolutionary workers of the Kailuan Coal Mine have launched a fierce offensive against the class enemy, keeping the class struggle red line running through the production struggle, promoting coal production to rise month by month, and setting a brilliant example for us.

Due to the successive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies, in an attempt to save their failing fate, are employing various tricks and schemes to sabotage production and undermine the economic foundation of our socialist country, disrupting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They often take revolutionary slogans and distort them, spreading reactionary nonsense to mislead people. They slander those revolutionary workers who seriously implement Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production" policy as "not emphasizing politics," cursing it as "opportunism" and "grasping at straws"; they denounce adherence to socialist labor discipline as "slavery"; they label all reasonable regulations as "revisionist frameworks"; they incite the masses to rebel against the eight-hour workday, and even incite saying, "Now that the workers are in power, whatever is said should be done, and whatever amount of work is wanted, that much should be the target." Practice has proven that wherever anarchist thinking runs rampant and production is poor, there must be class enemies behind the scenes.

The broad masses of workers and peasants must remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold. They must be good at seeing through the class enemy's disguises and exposing their tricks, and must resolutely smash and thoroughly frustrate their various schemes to sabotage the revolution and production.

The broad masses of workers and peasants must correctly understand the dialectical relationship between revolution and production. Revolution is the leader and the primary thing. If politics is not in command, work is bound to fail; if ideology does not take the lead, the direction will inevitably be wrong. Production must be led by revolution, but we cannot neglect production. If we relax production, it will bring great harm to socialist construction and will turn around and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of workers and peasants must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," forever maintain the character of the working people, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, firmly guard their production posts, adhere to the eight-hour workday, model the observance of socialist labor discipline, put forth great effort, strive to be the best, and with the great sense of responsibility of the masters of the state, excellently complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state.

    以革命带头，促进生产大发展
    本报评论员
    抓革命，促生产，是我们伟大领袖毛主席一贯的指导方针。以革命带头，促进生产大发展，这是当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要方面。
    毛主席亲自主持制订的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上改变着人们的精神面貌，群众中蕴藏的社会主义生产积极性，正象火山般地迸发出来，不断推动工农业生产掀起新的高涨。开滦煤矿的革命职工，向阶级敌人主动发起猛烈的进攻，把一条阶级斗争的红线始终贯穿在生产斗争的过程中，促进煤炭生产月月上升，为我们树立了光辉的榜样。
    由于无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们失败的命运，正在施展种种阴谋诡计，妄图以破坏生产来瓦解我国社会主义的经济基础，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们往往把革命的口号接过去，加以歪曲，散布反动的奇谈怪论，用来蛊惑人心。他们污蔑那些认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的革命职工，是什么“不突出政治”，谩骂这是“投机”、“捞稻草”；把遵守社会主义劳动纪律，斥之为“奴隶主义”；把合理的规章制度一概说成是修正主义框框；挑动群众造八小时工作制的反，还煽动说，“现在工人掌权了，说怎么办，就得怎么办，想干多少活，就订多少指标”。实践证明，凡是无政府主义思想泛滥、生产搞得不好的地方，必然有阶级敌人在背后搞鬼。
    广大工农群众，要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，百倍地提高革命警惕，善于识破阶级敌人的假面具，善于戳穿他们的鬼花招，对他们破坏革命和生产的种种阴谋活动，必须迎头痛击，坚决粉碎。
    广大工农群众，要正确地认识革命和生产的辩证关系。革命是带头挂帅的，是第一位的东西。政治不挂帅，工作准失败；思想不领先，方向必然偏。生产一定要用革命来带头，但是我们不能不搞生产。如果放松了生产，就会给社会主义建设带来非常大的危害，就会反转过来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    无产阶级革命派和广大工农群众，要坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，永远保持劳动人民的本色，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作制，模范地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，鼓足干劲，力争上游，以国家主人翁的伟大责任感，出色地完成党和国家交给我们的光荣任务。
