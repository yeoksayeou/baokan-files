“Six hundred million people in China are all like Shun and Yao.” In the great era of Chairman Mao, this is both poetry and reality.

From Zhang Thide to Lei Feng to Menhe, one can compile a long list of shining and brilliant proletarian heroes. From these heroes, we see the future of humanity, we see a new generation of communists.

Comrade Menhe is the most typical representative of this new generation. He possesses the qualities common to all heroes, but he has reached a height that other heroes have not. His height is: “Always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always obeying Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao”!

These “four alls” are the most concentrated expression of proletarian class nature, the highest expression of a Communist’s party spirit, and a manifestation of exceptionally mature Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought consciousness.

Throughout history, there have been some people who were “not afraid of death.” “Beneath great rewards are brave men,” who are not afraid of death for money. “A scholar will die for his benefactor,” who is not afraid of death for his benefactor. “Twenty years later, he will be a hero again,” which is completely filled with superstition and blind courage. Menhe is not afraid of death, and this has nothing to do with any of the above. He is “always for Chairman Mao” and is not afraid of death. This is the greatest courage, the most respectable courage, and the most reliable courage. Therefore, when the hand grenade starts smoking, when the motorcycle is about to hit someone, when the explosive is about to detonate, he always steps forward without hesitation, fearing no sacrifice to save others.

Throughout history, there have been some so-called “people who can endure hardship.” “Having endured the bitterest of bitterness, one can enjoy the sweetest of sweetness,” which is to endure hardship for future enjoyment. First, be a “peasant,” endure some hardship, then become a minister or a member of the Central Committee, which is to endure hardship for the sake of future “big advantages” to become a “superior person,” with a low and mean outlook. Menhe is different. He can endure great hardship and toil greatly because he “always thinks of Chairman Mao.” Because of this, he always takes the lead in enduring hardship and chooses the heaviest burdens. He can give everything he has without reservation to the people and to the Party.

Even more valuable is that he is not only a fierce warrior on the battlefield filled with gunfire. On the battlefield of the struggle over the line, where there are no guns or trenches, he is also an outstanding commander and a skilled fighter. At a time when the Chinese Khrushchev attempted to destroy the socialist economic foundation, he could actively organize fire to denounce the “three selfs and one package” and speak highly of the “people’s commune.” This is such a high level of consciousness, such a respectable and admirable proletarian fighting posture! Why could he do all this? Because he “always follows Chairman Mao, always obeys Chairman Mao”!

Under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, such noble and pure new generations of communists must emerge.

In the last sentence of the preface to Churchill’s “The World Crisis,” he says: “The terrible unknown future.”

The new factories, the bountiful people’s communes, and the rapidly advancing cutting-edge sciences that have appeared on our motherland are certainly what all domestic and foreign enemies fear. But what they fear the most is the emergence of a new generation represented by Menhe. Such people will not only bury the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes themselves but will also completely bury the hope of these classes’ restoration.

    共产主义一代新人的典型
    ——赞门合的“四个一切”
　　红文
    “六亿神州尽舜尧”，在伟大的毛泽东时代，是诗，也是现实。
    从张思德到雷锋到门合，人们可以开列一个长长的光耀夺目的无产阶级英雄的名单。我们从这些英雄身上看到了人类的未来，看到了共产主义一代新人。
    门合同志就是这一代新人最典型的代表。他具备一般英雄共有的品质，又达到了一般英雄所没有达到的高度。他的高度就是：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”！
    这“四个一切”，是无产阶级阶级性最集中的表现，是共产党人党性的最高表现，是马列主义、毛泽东思想觉悟异常成熟的表现。
    自古以来，有过一些“不怕死”的人。“重赏之下必有勇夫”，是为钱而“不怕死”。“士为知己者死”，是为“知己者”而“不怕死”。“二十年后又是一条好汉”，则完全是充满迷信色彩的盲目的匹夫之勇。门合同志不怕死，跟这一切毫不相干。他是“一切为着毛主席”而不怕死。这才是最大的勇，最可敬的勇，最可靠的勇。所以，在手榴弹冒烟时，在摩托车将要撞上人身时，在炸药即将爆炸时，他总是毫不犹豫地挺身而出，不怕牺牲自己去救护别人。
    自古以来，有过一些所谓“能吃苦”的人。“吃尽苦中苦，方得甜中甜”，是为日后的享受而吃苦。先当“农民”，吃点苦，以后当部长、中央委员，这是为了将来“占大便宜”做“人上人”而吃苦，境界低而且卑。门合同志则不然。他之所以能吃大苦，耐大劳，是因为他“一切想着毛主席”。唯其如此，他总是吃苦在别人前头，担子拣重的挑。他自己的一切都可以无保留地献给人民，献给党。
    尤为可贵的是，他不仅在炮火连天的战场上是冲锋陷阵的猛士。在没有枪声、没有堑壕的路线斗争的战场上，他也是卓越的指挥员和善战的战斗员。在中国赫鲁晓夫妄图搞垮社会主义经济基础之际，他能主动组织火力怒斥“三自一包”，大讲“人民公社好”。这是多么高的觉悟，多么可敬可佩的无产阶级的战斗姿态！为什么他能做到这一切呢？因为他“一切紧跟毛主席，一切服从毛主席”！
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的哺育下，必然会出现这样高尚的、纯粹的共产主义一代新人。
    丘吉尔在《大战回忆》序言中的最后一句话是：“可怕的未知的未来”。
    在我们祖国大地上出现的新厂房，丰收的人民公社，突飞猛进的尖端科学，当然是国内外一切敌人所害怕的。但是，最最使他们感到可怕的，是门合所代表的一代新人的出现。这样的人，不但将埋葬资产阶级和一切剥削阶级本身，而且将彻底埋葬这些阶级复辟的希望。
