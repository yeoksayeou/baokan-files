The Third Production Brigade's old poor peasant, Jin Xingrong, writes:

Chinese Khrushchev advocates "freedom to hire labor," claiming that "some people ask if there are any restrictions on hiring people to farm the land? Our answer is no restrictions, whether hiring long-term labor or temporary labor, as long as it is self-owned and self-farmed land or land hired to be farmed, we should protect it and not infringe upon it." He even more viciously says, "Hired farmers hope for exploitation, not against exploitation." This is clearly an attempt to let those fallen landlords and rich peasants ride on our heads again! We firmly do not agree!

Speaking of the hardships of being a hired laborer for landlords and rich peasants in the old society, there is truly too much to say. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The so-called rural proletariat refers to long-term laborers, monthly laborers, and temporary laborers. These hired farmers not only have no land, no farming tools, but also no capital, and can only work for a living. Their working hours are long, wages are low, treatment is poor, and jobs are unstable, surpassing other workers. Such people in the countryside are the most difficult. In the evil old society, in order to maintain the lowest standard of living, we had to go to the homes of landlords and rich peasants to sell our labor. Landlords and rich peasants ruthlessly exploited us, plundering the fruits of our labor, and enjoying the results. When we grew old and weak, and they could no longer squeeze any more out of us, the landlords and rich peasants would kick us out. I started working as a long-term laborer for a landlord at the age of twelve. From one family to another, all landlords are equally black, and all landlords are equally cruel. From the first day of the New Year to the last day of the year, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, whether it was snowing or raining, I had to get up early every day. Yet, my annual wage could not even support myself, and my family had to beg for rice. I worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for over forty years, but I still had no house and no land. My family lived in a broken house for two months here, rented a cow shed there for a year. Once, we moved into an old and dilapidated empty school building. Not long after, the building collapsed, and my family nearly died. The system of hiring labor is indeed a system where people eat people.

Yet, Chinese Khrushchev still says, "Hired farmers hope for exploitation, not against exploitation." This is utterly absurd! Chinese Khrushchev and the landlords and rich peasants are wearing the same pants. His advocacy for "freedom to hire labor" is to overthrow the socialist system, restore the exploitative system of people eating people, and make the socialist China, which Chairman Mao personally established, regress to the semi-feudal, semi-colonial old China. Chinese Khrushchev's heart is more poisonous than a snake!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." Since liberation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have embarked on the broad road to common prosperity. The collective path is becoming wider and wider, and life is becoming sweeter and sweeter. Chinese Khrushchev wants us poor and lower-middle peasants to retrace our steps and suffer twice. This is impossible! We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely walk the socialist path! We farm for the revolution. We will never allow the exploitative system of hiring labor to resurrect. We want all people of the world to walk the bright path of socialism and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly all over the globe!

    不准雇工剥削制度借尸还魂
    第三生产队老贫农　金兴容
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“雇工自由”，胡说什么“有人问雇人耕种的土地是否有限制？我们的答复是没有限制，无论雇长工也好，雇零工也好，只要是自己所有自耕和雇人耕种的土地，我们就应该加以保护，不得侵犯。”他还更恶毒地说什么“雇农希望剥削，不是反对剥削。”这明明是要让那些垮了台的地主、富农又骑在我们头上拉屎拉尿！我们坚决不答应！
    提起旧社会给地主、富农当雇工的苦，真是说也说不完。毛主席他老人家早就指出：“所谓农村无产阶级，是指长工、月工、零工等雇农而言。此等雇农不仅无土地，无农具，又无丝毫资金，只得营工度日。其劳动时间之长，工资之少，待遇之薄，职业之不安定，超过其他工人。此种人在乡村中是最感困难者”。在万恶的旧社会，我们为了维持最低的生活，不得不到地主、富农家卖工。地主、富农极其残酷地剥削我们，掠夺我们用血汗换来的劳动果实，坐享其成。等到我们年老体弱，从我们身上再也榨不出什么油水，地主、富农就把我们一脚踢开。我从十二岁起，就给地主当长工。从这家做到那家，天下乌鸦一般黑，天下地主一样狠。从正月初一到腊月三十，不分春夏秋冬，不管落雪下雨，我每天都起早摸黑。可是，我一年的工钱还养活不了自己，一家老小只好去讨米。我给地主做了四十多年长工，还是房无一间，地无一垄，一家人在这里弄个破屋住两个月，到那里租间牛棚住年把。一次，搬进一个又旧又破的空学堂里，住不多久，房子就塌了，一家人险些都被压死。雇工制度就是这样一个人吃人的制度。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫还说什么“雇农希望剥削，不是反对剥削”。真是混账透顶！中国赫鲁晓夫和地主、富农穿的是一条裤子。他大肆鼓吹“雇工自由”的目的，就是要推翻社会主义制度，恢复人吃人的剥削制度，使毛主席亲手创建的社会主义中国，退回到半封建、半殖民地的旧中国。中国赫鲁晓夫的心比毒蛇还毒！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”解放以来，在毛主席的英明领导下，我们贫下中农走上了共同富裕的康庄大道，集体道路越走越宽，生活越过越甜。中国赫鲁晓夫想叫我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦，这办不到！社会主义道路我们贫下中农走定了！我们为革命种田。我们坚决不准吃人的雇工剥削制度借尸还魂。我们要让全世界人民都走社会主义光明大道，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全球！
