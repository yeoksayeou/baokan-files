Shanghai's steel industry has seen a great situation. The city's daily production of steel and steel products has increased again. Many factories have seen a new situation of large-scale and significant increases in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 25 — Since entering May, Shanghai's steel industry has seen a very inspiring situation. Revolutionary workers are full of spirit and high morale. They fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely carry out the great policy of "revolution and production," making the revolution deeper and production more prosperous. In the first and middle ten days of May, the city's daily production of steel and steel products, which had already increased significantly in April compared to March, has increased again. In these twenty days, news of breaking records has been frequent, new products have been continuously produced, and new technologies and techniques have been continuously researched and successfully implemented. Many factories have seen a new situation of large-scale and significant increases in production. The high-quality new steel products produced by these factories are being shipped in large quantities to support the country's socialist revolution, socialist construction, and national defense construction.

Intensifying class struggle, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, and continuously launching attacks on the enemies of the proletariat are important reasons for the continuous improvement of production in many steel factories in Shanghai. Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, one of the largest steel enterprises in Shanghai, has held over 150 study classes on Mao Zedong Thought in the past month, from the factory, workshop, and section to the team. Revolutionary workers have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to hold over 100 criticism and struggle meetings, fiercely criticizing and fighting against a handful of stubborn reactionaries, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and smashing their attempts to reverse verdicts. It is in this sharp class struggle that revolutionary workers deeply realize that producing one more ton of steel or rolling one more ton of steel is a heavier blow to the enemy. Workers in various workshops regard the production of steel and rolling steel as a political struggle, fighting fiercely and creating a series of new production achievements. The iron production in the blast furnace workshop in April was 15% higher than the average production in the first quarter; since May, the daily production level has increased significantly compared to April. The oxygen steelmaking in the third converter workshop has maintained an average of about 15 furnaces per shift since it was put into production; on the eve of May Day, it increased to 18 furnaces, and on May Day, it reached 20 furnaces, achieving an unprecedented production level. Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 completed its production plan for steel and steel products in the first 20 days of May. Revolutionary workers in other steel plants in Shanghai have also, in their attacks on class enemies, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, greatly arousing the production enthusiasm of revolutionary workers and creating a new situation of significant increases in production.

Using revolution to guide production, emphasizing proletarian politics in production, has made the revolutionary workers in Shanghai's steel industry more enthusiastic about production, and the trend of surpassing each other has been vigorously carried out in many steel furnaces and rolling mills. The workers of the Second Plant of New Shanghai Steel Plant created three new records in three shifts on the day celebrating the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was personally drafted by Chairman Mao. Moreover, after the new records appeared, they eliminated the previous phenomenon of large fluctuations and made the entire production stable at a very high level.

Revolutionary workers in Shanghai's steel industry remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "saving every penny for the cause of war and revolution," establish the idea of saving for the revolution, and strive to tap the potential of coal and other steelmaking raw materials and materials. Workers and revolutionary technicians of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 together studied and improved the exhaust structure of the ironmaking furnace, saving 10 kilograms of coke per ton of molten iron, which can save more than 10,000 tons of coal per year. Recently, they have continued to improve with the spirit of continuous revolution and found new ways to save coal, which can save more coal for the country.

    狠抓阶级斗争深入开展革命大批判  坚决贯彻抓革命促生产的伟大方针
    上海钢铁工业战线出现一派大好形势。全市钢和钢材的日产量又有新提高。许多工厂生产出现大面积、大幅度上升的新局面
    新华社上海二十五日电　进入五月份以来，上海钢铁工业战线出现了一派极为鼓舞人心的大好形势。广大革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使革命步步深入，生产蒸蒸日上。五月份上中两旬，全市钢和钢材的日产量，在四月份比三月份有较大幅度增长的基础上，又有新的提高。这二十天内，创造新纪录的喜讯频传，新产品接连制成，新工艺、新技术不断研究成功。许多厂的生产出现了大面积、大幅度上升的新局面。这些厂生产的大批优质新型钢材，源源运出，支援了国家的社会主义革命、社会主义建设和国防建设。
    狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，连续不断地向无产阶级的敌人打进攻战，这是上海许多钢铁厂生产不断提高的重要原因。上海最大的钢铁企业之一的上海第一钢铁厂，最近一个多月中，从工厂、车间、工段一直到班组，先后举办了一百五十多期毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命职工认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示。革命职工们以毛泽东思想为武器，举行了一百多次批判斗争大会，狠批狠斗一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子，粉碎了他们的翻案妖风。就在这尖锐的阶级斗争中，革命职工深刻地认识到，多炼一吨钢铁，多轧一吨钢材，就是给敌人更沉重的打击。各车间工人把炼钢轧钢这场生产斗争看作是一场政治斗争，猛打猛冲，创造了一系列新的生产成绩。高炉车间四月份生铁的产量比第一季度的平均产量提高百分之十五；五月份以来，日产水平又比四月份有很大增长。第三转炉车间的氧气炼钢，投入生产以来平均班产一直保持在十五炉左右；“五一”前夕，一下提高到了十八炉，“五一”当天，又跃到了二十炉，达到了前所未有的生产水平。上钢三厂在五月的头二十天内，钢和钢材的产量都超额完成了生产计划。上海其他一些钢铁厂的革命职工，也都在向阶级敌人发动进攻中，活学活用毛泽东思想，大大激发了广大革命职工的生产热情，开创了生产大幅度上升的新局面。
    用革命统帅生产，在生产中突出无产阶级政治，使上海钢铁工业战线的革命职工，生产干劲越来越大，你追我赶的热潮，在许多炼钢炉前、轧钢机旁如火如荼地开展起来。新沪钢铁厂二分厂的工人，在欢庆毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的日子里，三个班连创了三个新纪录，而且在新纪录出现以后，消除了过去经常出现的波动起伏比较大的现象，使整个生产稳定在一个很高的水平上。
    上海钢铁工业的革命职工，牢记毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的伟大教导，树立为革命而节约的思想，千方百计地挖掘煤炭以及其他炼钢原料、材料的潜力。上钢一厂的工人和革命的技术人员一起，研究改进了化铁炉的排风结构，每吨铁水可以节省十公斤焦炭，一年因此可以节约一万多吨煤炭。最近，他们又以不断革命的精神，继续作进一步的改进，又找到了节约煤炭的新途径，可以为国家节省更多的煤炭。
