Hundreds of thousands of West Germans and West Berlin residents gathered in the West German capital of Bonn on May 11 to hold an unprecedented mass rally and demonstration against the West German authorities' attempt to strengthen fascist rule through the "Emergency Law."

This infamous "Emergency Law" is a reactionary bill aimed at suppressing and strangling progressive and democratic forces, which has been opposed by the West German people for a decade and has not been passed. Today, as the workers' movement and student movement in West Germany are flourishing, the West German authorities have once again proposed this fascist law, intending to pass it in parliament soon.

The West German ruling class's reactionary measure has sparked immense anger among the West German people. Workers, peasants, students, youth, and progressive figures from all walks of life across West Germany and West Berlin rushed to Bonn to participate in the demonstration, expressing their determination to oppose this fascist law.

This demonstration was the third anti-"Emergency Law" rally held in Bonn following those on May 9 and 10. The demonstrators initially marched in groups through Bonn. At 3 PM, the crowds from all directions converged at the central square of Bonn University. Giant banners hung from the central podium and the surrounding trees read: "Democracy, Not Emergency Law," "The Emergency Law Serves Monopoly Capital," and "Workers and Students United Against the Emergency Law." Banners opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam were also displayed. The demonstrators waved countless red flags and placards, and slogans echoed through the air. Some demonstrators also held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and wore Mao badges.

Speakers at the rally unanimously condemned the West German government's "Emergency Law." Someone proposed that all universities in West Germany should hold a general strike soon to protest. This proposal was warmly welcomed by the crowd, who shouted, "General Strike! General Strike!" As the rally continued, more demonstration groups arrived, some singing "The Internationale." After the rally, over 4,000 young students, despite being sprayed by police water cannons, marched in order to the French Embassy to hold a protest demonstration, supporting the Paris students' ongoing struggle against the decadent French educational system.

Anti-"Emergency Law" banners were posted on many streets in Bonn, and leaflets calling for participation in the demonstration were distributed. Young actors performed short street plays on trucks, traveling through Bonn to rally citizens to join the protest demonstration. The actors shouted slogans along the way: "Capitalism Leads to Fascism!"

The massive demonstration frightened the West German ruling class. West German Chancellor Kiesinger and Vice-Chancellor Brandt both fled to other locations. Traffic in Bonn was almost completely disrupted. The Bonn authorities mobilized large numbers of police, water cannons, mounted police, and even helicopters to threaten the demonstrators.

    “要民主，不要紧急状态法”
    西德和西柏林群众举行空前规模示威
    坚决反对波恩当局制定加强法西斯统治的反动法案
    新华社波恩十一日电　西德人民和西柏林居民六万多人十一日汇集在西德首都波恩，举行空前规模的群众集会和示威，反对西德当局为加强法西斯统治而制订的“紧急状态法”。
    这个臭名远扬的“紧急状态法”，是西德统治集团图谋用来镇压和扼杀进步和民主力量的反动法案，十年来由于遭到西德人民的强烈反对，一直未能通过。在西德工人运动和学生运动日益蓬勃高涨的今天，西德当局又重新抛出这一法西斯法案，准备最近在议会通过。
    西德统治集团的这一反动措施，激起了西德人民的无比愤怒。广大工人、农民、大中学生、青年以及各界进步人士从西德各地和西柏林赶到波恩参加示威游行，表示他们反对这个法西斯法案的决心。
    这次示威是继九日、十日之后，在波恩举行的第三次反对“紧急状态法”的群众示威。示威群众起先分队在波恩游行，下午三时，队伍从四面八方汇集到市中心波恩大学的广场。广场正中的主席台上和周围的树木间都悬挂着巨幅的标语，上面写着：“要民主，不要紧急状态法”、“紧急状态法为垄断资本服务”、“工人、学生共同反对紧急状态法”。广场上还挂着反对美国侵略越南战争的标语。示威者拿着数不清的红旗和标语牌，口号声此伏彼起。有些示威者还拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，佩戴着毛主席像章。
    在大会上发言的人一致谴责西德政府制订的“紧急状态法”。会上有人要求西德各大学最近举行总罢课，表示抗议。这一建议受到群众的热烈欢迎，大家高呼：“总罢课！总罢课！”大会举行时，还有不少示威队伍陆续抵达，有些队伍还齐声高唱《国际歌》。大会结束后，四千余名青年学生不顾警察用水龙车喷射，列队前往法国大使馆举行抗议示威，支持巴黎学生连日来反对法国现行的腐朽教育制度的斗争。
    在波恩市的许多街道上，到处都张贴着抗议“紧急状态法”的标语，并有人散发号召参加示威的传单。青年演员乘卡车在波恩市内巡回演出短小的活报剧，号召市民参加抗议示威。演员们沿途高呼口号：“资本主义导致法西斯！”
    群众的强大示威行动使西德统治集团胆战心惊。西德总理基辛格和副总理勃兰特都避往外地。波恩全城交通几乎完全断绝。波恩当局调动大批警察、水龙车、马队，甚至出动直升飞机对示威者进行威胁。
