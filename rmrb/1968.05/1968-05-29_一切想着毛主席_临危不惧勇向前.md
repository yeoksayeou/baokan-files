	Always thinking of Chairman Mao, brave forward in the face of danger. Comrade Men Hesheng, an excellent cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, fearlessly sacrificed his life to protect twenty-seven class brothers. This heroic deed sets a brilliant example for us of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao.

	Being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao is the greatest principle, the highest consciousness, and the purest party spirit for revolutionary soldiers. Being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line is the touchstone for determining whether a person is a revolutionary or not, and it is the dividing line between true revolutionaries and false ones. Comrade Men Hesheng, an excellent cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, is precisely because of his infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao that he harbors deep proletarian feelings, studies and applies Chairman Mao’s works actively, learns and then uses them, and is selfless and dedicated, always a revolutionary “old yellow cow.” It is precisely because of his infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao that he has, for twenty years, resolutely carried out and bravely defended Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, standing firmly on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line in the storms of class struggle. It is precisely because of his infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao that, when the lives of twenty-seven class brothers were threatened, he faced danger without fear, remained calm, and sacrificed himself bravely to defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, displaying the greatest wisdom and courage of a revolutionary cadre armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	I am also a revolutionary cadre nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Last March, I and a fellow villager returned to Guangxi to visit our families. While crossing a river, the water rose suddenly, becoming deep and swift. The small boat we were in tilted sharply, and several Red Guards and revolutionary masses fell into the water and were swept away by the current. At this critical moment, it was Chairman Mao’s teachings of “to die for the people’s interests is heavier than Mount Tai” and “to struggle means to make sacrifices” that made me jump into the rapid current, fearlessly saving three Red Guards and revolutionary masses. When the people thanked me, although my body was numb, the first words that came to my mind were “Thank Chairman Mao, it is Chairman Mao who told me to do this.” For this small deed for the people, the leadership awarded me a second-class merit citation. Studying Comrade Men Hesheng’s deeds, I compared myself to him and felt that I am still far behind. At the beginning of this year, the Party appointed me as a political instructor. I felt that my abilities were lacking and my confidence was insufficient. Compared to Comrade Men Hesheng, I am vastly different, especially in the aspect of loyalty to Chairman Mao and in the application of Chairman Mao’s works.

	In the future, I will take Comrade Men Hesheng as my example, with deep proletarian feelings, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works even more diligently, carry forward Chairman Mao’s advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, never be self-satisfied, and consciously launch a revolution in the depths of my soul, waging an offensive against the “self.” Truly becoming like Comrade Men Hesheng: always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao.

    一切想着毛主席　临危不惧勇向前
    人民解放军某部指导员　伍福全
    无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志，奋不顾身，用自己的生命保卫了二十七名阶级兄弟。这一英雄行为，为我们树立了无限忠于毛主席的光辉榜样。
    无限忠于毛主席，是我们革命战士最大的公，最高的觉悟，最纯的党性。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线，是考验一个人革命与不革命的试金石，是区分真革命和假革命的分水岭。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志，正是由于他对毛主席无限忠诚，所以他怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，学了就用，毫不利己专门利人，永当革命“老黄牛”。正是由于他对毛主席无限忠诚，所以他能二十年如一日，坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线，在阶级斗争的风浪中，始终不渝地站在毛主席革命路线一边。正是由于他对毛主席无限忠诚，所以他在二十七名阶级兄弟生命遇到威胁时，临危不惧，面不改色，为保卫毛主席革命路线而英勇献身，表现出用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命干部的最大智慧和勇敢。
    我也是毛泽东思想哺育下的一个革命干部。去年三月，我和一个同乡战友回广西探家，在渡河时，河水猛涨，水深流急，我们坐的小船，船身猛一倾斜，几个红卫兵小将和革命群众掉进水中，被卷入急流。就在这关键时刻，是毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”和“要奋斗就会有牺牲”的伟大教导，使我跳下急流，奋不顾身，战胜了寒冷和疲劳，抢救上来三个红卫兵小将和革命群众。当人民感谢我时，我虽然全身麻木，但我想到的第一句话就是“要感谢毛主席，这是毛主席叫我这样做的。”我仅仅为人民做了这点小事，领导上给我记了二等功。我学习了门合同志的事迹，反复进行了对照，感到我和门合同志相比还差得很远。今年年初，党让我担任指导员，我感到自己能力差，信心有些不足。和门合同志相比，千差万差，就是差在对毛主席的“忠”字上，差在活学活用毛主席著作的“用”字上。
    今后，我决心以门合同志为榜样，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，永不自满，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，对“私”字打进攻战。真正做到象门合同志那样：一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。
