The entire nation's military and civilians resolutely decide to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, further promote the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, root out all traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

A Xinhua News Agency report on May 18: The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and the vast number of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, while solemnly commemorating the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16, 1966, Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely decide, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop the great victory in thought achieved by the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all positions!

People across the country revisit Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as proposed in the Notice, and seriously study the important article "An Epoch-Making Document" by the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They have a deeper understanding of the profound significance of the sustained and in-depth development of revolutionary criticism. They firmly declare: We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the high principles of the proletariat, further criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by China's Khrushchev, criticize right opportunism and the reactionary thoughts of being "left" in form but right in essence, criticize all anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary trends, criticize anarchism, criticize sectarianism and factionalism, criticize all manifestations of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology, and carry out revolutionary criticism to the end, clearing the way in thought for the all-around victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Seven hundred million revolutionary people strive to be critics

Further consolidating the proletariat's dominance in thought

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Under the radiant guidance of the Notice personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the military and civilians across the country have, over the past two years, with an unprecedented breadth and depth, launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of class enemies. From the capital to the borders, from cities to the countryside, seven hundred million revolutionary people are all concerned about national affairs and strive to be critics. The revolutionary criticism has promoted the unprecedented widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, making the proletariat further dominant in thought.

The old workers of the San Tiao Shi Industrial District in Tianjin have always been at the forefront of revolutionary criticism. They use their own bitter history to severely criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents who attempt to restore capitalism. Some deeply resentful old workers have given more than a hundred bitter struggle reports to local revolutionary masses in half a year. The old workers of San Tiao Shi, who have played a leading role in the worker class in the revolutionary criticism, are determined to hold high the revolutionary flag of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and sweep all the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods they spread into the garbage heap of history. The people of Lu Wang Zhai Brigade, Tao Yuan Production Team, Fu Ning County, Hebei Province, have held more than 1,400 criticism meetings in various forms over the past two years. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have seen more clearly the wolfish ambitions of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism. They declare that they will definitely carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and sustainably, criticizing all reactionary things to be more stinky than dog shit. The soldiers and officers of the Sixth Company of a certain motorized transport team of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, who have been driving on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for many years, put revolutionary criticism cartoons and articles on the canopy of their trucks when the team sets out for duty, turning them into mobile columns. They declare that they will definitely carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end, further consolidating the proletariat's dominance in thought.

Burn the fire of revolutionary criticism more fiercely

Resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary people, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country declare that they will definitely burn the fire of revolutionary criticism more fiercely, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, smash the rightist reversal wind, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, root out the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, further consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary workers of Wuhan No. 3 Cotton Mill, who are launching a new wave of revolutionary criticism, continuously launch fierce attacks on class enemies, resolutely counter the rightist reversal wind blown by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, smash the plots and tricks of class enemies to sabotage the revolution and production, and root out a handful of class enemies sheltered by the capitalist roaders. The revolutionary workers of this mill declare that they will definitely carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end, making China's Khrushchev and his agents never be able to rise again. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Chemical Fiber Factory, relying on the "people's war" of revolutionary criticism launched by all the revolutionary workers of the factory, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, smash the rightist reversal wind blown by class enemies, criticize bourgeois reactionary thoughts, and consolidate the newly established revolutionary committee in the struggle. The deputy director of the revolutionary committee of this factory and female worker Wan Laozhu deeply feels that a handful of capitalist roaders and class enemies like these do not give up easily and are waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. We must firmly grasp the weapon of revolutionary criticism and strike them hard. Wu Chun'an, the party branch secretary of Xi Liang Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Yiqing County, Shanxi Province, and a national model agricultural laborer, says: Our brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, in combination with the local class struggle situation and the current struggle tasks, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, rooting out the former Kuomintang reactionary lieutenant colonel who usurped the leading position in our brigade, deeply educating the broad masses and striking the enemy hard. The Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, which has consecutively won the title of Four Good Company for seven years, while on duty on the railway line from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, firmly remembers Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." The entire company's soldiers and officers maintain high revolutionary vigilance and withstand the sugar-coated bullets. They say that they will definitely carry out the revolutionary criticism sustainably and in-depth, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticizing the bourgeoisie politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat over them.

In the revolutionary criticism, establish Mao Zedong Thought

Ensure that the proletarian state remains red for ten thousand generations

The great leader Chairman Mao often teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. To destroy, one must reason, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the primary task, construction is also included." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "We must establish the authority of the proletariat, establish the new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. In a word, we must establish Mao Zedong Thought." The proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary people, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country, while celebrating the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, say that thousands of victories and ten thousand victories, the unprecedented widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, is the greatest victory. Mao Zedong Thought grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people is the iron wall and copper wall against revisionism.

The broad revolutionary workers of Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "criticizing the bourgeoisie," persistently and fiercely launching a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, making Mao Zedong Thought widely disseminated, greatly enhancing the revolutionary workers' class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness, and making the entire factory's revolution and production flourish. Liang Bianliang, Song Liying, the deputy party branch secretary, and Jia Jincai, the director of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade, Xishan County, say that through carrying out revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought has further occupied all positions in Dazhai, arming the broad masses of community members. This is the greatest harvest. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have a direction for the revolution, we are full of strength, and the red state will remain unchanged for ten thousand generations. Shen Yuying, an active learner and propagandist of Chairman Mao's works in Hongjin Brigade, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, excitedly says: Under the radiant guidance of the Notice, hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the country have launched a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism, smashing the evil plot of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party to restore capitalism, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and making Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts. This is the greatest victory. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Daguang Brigade, Huicheng County, Guangdong Province, combine the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, learning one relevant quote from Chairman Mao, severely criticizing one counter-revolutionary fallacy of China's Khrushchev, struggling against the "self" in one's own mind, effectively promoting the revolutionization of thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: The deeper the criticism of revisionism, the fiercer the struggle against selfishness, the closer to Chairman Mao, the higher the enthusiasm for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. Wang Biquan, an active learner and propagandist of Chairman Mao's works in the Air Force and a model soldier, says that we must raise our understanding of revolutionary criticism to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and better learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the revolutionary criticism.

Carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end

Let Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all positions

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame by learning from King Xiang Yu." The hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country and the Red Guards have, in recent days, revisited the Notice personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao, seriously studied the important article "An Epoch-Making Document" by the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, and are more spirited and enthusiastic. They resolutely decide, starting from the major issues of the two lines, to carry out the revolutionary criticism more broadly, deeply, and sustainably, clearing the way in thought for the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many revolutionary workers in factories and enterprises in Shanghai proudly say: Revolutionary criticism is a sharp weapon for launching fierce attacks on class enemies. The deeper the revolutionary criticism is carried out, the less class enemies can escape; the more sustained the revolutionary criticism is carried out, the more the red state can be secured; the broader the revolutionary criticism is carried out, the more new situations will appear in production. Revolutionary workers unanimously declare that they will, with the workshop as the base, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, turning the workshop, workshop team, steelmaking furnace front, and rolling mill side into battlefields for fiercely firing at traitors, spies, stubborn capitalist roaders, and all class enemies, and will not stop until complete victory is achieved! The soldiers and officers of the unit where Liu Yingjun, who was previously in the Sixth Company executing the "support the left" task in the Weihe Forest Area, Heilongjiang Province, deeply feel that a handful of stubborn capitalist roaders and all class enemies will not be eliminated by themselves. They always want to counterattack. We must resolutely struggle and criticize them and cannot talk about any "equality" or be soft-hearted. The soldiers and officers of a certain ship of the East China Fleet proudly say: The great commander Chairman Mao has inspected our ship. We must definitely become a fighting collective defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must continue to hold high the flag of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. More than 400,000 revolutionary people in Wulian County, Shandong Province, while enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of the issuance of the Notice, have launched a more magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism. They turn the fields, field edges, courtyard edges, street edges, and families into battlefields for revolutionary criticism, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, turning Wulian County into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, and letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever on all fronts!

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”在毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》的光辉照耀下，全国军民高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，两年来以从未有过的广度和深度，对一小撮阶级敌人展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。从首都到边疆，从城市到农村，七亿革命人民人人关心国家大事，人人争当批判家。革命的大批判，促进了毛泽东思想的空前大普及，使无产阶级在思想上进一步取得了统治地位。
    天津市三条石工业区的老工人，一直站在革命大批判的前列。他们用自己的血泪史，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄想复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。有的苦大仇深的老工人，半年内向当地革命群众作了一百多场忆苦报告。在革命大批判中发挥了工人阶级主力军作用的三条石老工人，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派批倒批臭，把他们散布的一切反革命修正主义黑货统统扫进历史的垃圾堆。河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队，两年来开了各种形式的批判会一千四百多次，广大贫下中农和革命干部更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的狼子野心。他们表示，一定要把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，把一切反动的东西批得比狗屎还臭。人民解放军总后勤部学习毛主席著作标兵、长年奔驰在青藏高原上的汽车某团六连指战员，在车队出发执勤的时候，就把革命大批判的漫画、文章贴在汽车篷布上，办成活动专栏，走到那里批判到那里。指战员们表示，一定要把革命大批判进行到底，进一步巩固无产阶级在思想上取得的统治地位。
      把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺
    坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员表示，一定要把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派彻底批倒批臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来，进一步巩固新生的革命委员会，加强无产阶级专政。

      在革命大批判中大立毛泽东思想
    保证无产阶级江山千秋万代不变色
    伟大领袖毛主席经常教导我们：不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。林副主席指示我们：“我们要大立无产阶级的权威，要大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。”各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，在欢呼两年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利时说，千胜利，万胜利，毛泽东思想的空前大普及，是最大的胜利。毛泽东思想掌握了亿万革命群众，就是筑起了防修、反修的铜墙铁壁。

        把革命大批判坚决进行到底
      让毛泽东思想永远占领一切阵地
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”全国亿万工农兵群众和红卫兵小将，连日来重温了伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》，认真学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部重要文章《划时代的文献》，意气更风发，斗志更昂扬，他们决心从两条路线的大是大非出发，更加广泛、深入、持久地开展革命大批判，为无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利从思想上扫清道路。上海许多工厂企业的广大革命职工豪迈地说：革命大批判是向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的锐利武器。革命大批判深入搞，阶级敌人逃不了；革命大批判持久搞，红色江山保得牢；革命大批判广泛搞，生产出现新面貌。革命职工们一致表示，要以班组为基础，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把车间、班组、炼钢炉前、轧钢机旁，都变成向叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切阶级敌人猛烈开火的战场，不获全胜，决不收兵！在黑龙江省苇河林区执行支左任务的刘英俊生前所在连队的指战员，深有体会地说：一小撮顽固不化的走资派和一切阶级敌人是不会自行消灭的，他们总想伺机反扑。我们对他们就是要坚决斗争，坚决批判，决不能讲什么“平等”，决不能有半点手软。东海舰队某舰的指战员自豪地说：伟大统帅毛主席视察过我们的军舰，我们一定要成为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗集体。我们一定要继续高举革命的批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批倒批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。山东五莲县四十多万革命人民在热烈欢庆《通知》发表两周年的日子里，掀起了声势更浩大的革命大批判热潮。他们把田间、地头、场头、街头和家庭，都当成革命大批判的战场，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的修正主义黑货彻底批倒批臭，把五莲县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在各条战线上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
