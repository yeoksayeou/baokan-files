The editor's note: Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Now, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming like red flowers all over the motherland. This fully reflects the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, the great changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary masses of China, and the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes have become classrooms for hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to educate and reform themselves; they have become battlefields for the broad revolutionary masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and expose the evil plots of class enemies. They have played a tremendous role in promoting the thought revolution of the people, in promoting the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in enabling the proletariat to further gain dominance in thought.

To fully reflect the great achievements of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we have opened this column, "In Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes." We hope that the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the broad readership across the country will send us their experiences and gains from running study classes, written as short and concise news reports, stories, essays, etc. Let us work together to make this column a success.

The Old Team Leader Has Seen the Light

Not long ago, the team leader of the 8th Brigade of Jin Shi Production Brigade in Ren He People's Commune, Min Quan County, Henan Province, Geng Yanmao, came to the study class with a heart full of grievances. He thought: I was born and raised in hardship, and every day I think about socialism, long for socialism, and work for socialism. From the War of Liberation to the establishment of the commune, over the past decade, haven't I at least worked hard? Why, with the advent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, am I being criticized with big-character posters and criticism meetings, not only for being "subjectivist" but also for "undermining the wall of socialism"? Can I still be a team leader?

In the study class, this old team leader, together with poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not rely on past merits, but strive to create new ones" and "Those who shirk responsibility, fear responsibility, do not allow others to speak, and whose buttocks are like a tiger's, ten out of ten will fail." He examined his own words and deeds. He realized that he indeed had the idea of relying on past merits, always feeling that he had contributed; in the past decade of work, his subjectivism was very serious, he liked to scold people, could not listen to the opinions of the masses, and was not humble in accepting criticism. He thought that now the masses were posting big-character posters about him in this regard, truly hitting the mark, and it was a great help to him. He saw the light on this issue and put down his first mental burden.

However, Geng Yanmao still could not understand why the masses said he was "undermining the wall of socialism."

Next, the Mao Zedong Thought study class guided everyone to study a passage from Chairman Mao, combined with an incident in their unit, and criticized a fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev. Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "only socialism can save China," Geng Yanmao examined his own thoughts and work performance during the period of the country's temporary economic difficulties. During this period, he implemented the revisionist black goods of "three independences and one contract" and "four freedoms" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the party. Wasn't this undermining the wall of socialism? He thought more and more clearly that all mistakes were due to the character of "selfishness," and all hatreds should be directed at the Chinese Khrushchev.

Geng Yanmao saw the light and, according to Chairman Mao's teaching on "honestly admitting mistakes to the masses and immediately correcting them," the day after he returned from the study class, he immediately convened a meeting of the commune members, checked his mistakes with the masses, publicly admitted his mistakes, and severely criticized the "three independences and one contract" and "four freedoms" counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Geng Yanmao's actions were warmly praised by the broad masses of commune members. Under his influence, this brigade abolished the old work-point system and implemented the Dazhai-style socialist labor management system. From then on, the relationship between the cadres and the masses became more harmonious, and both revolution and production showed new vitality.

专栏：

    编者按：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”现在，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，正象朵朵红花开遍了祖国大地。这充分地反映了毛泽东思想的大普及，我国广大革命人民群众精神面貌的大变化和无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。
    毛泽东思想学习班，已经成为亿万军民活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，破私立公，自己教育自己，自己改造自己的课堂；成为广大革命群众开展革命大批判，揭露阶级敌人罪恶阴谋的战场。它对促进人的思想革命化，对推动无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，使无产阶级在思想上进一步取得统治地位，起了巨大的作用。
    为了充分地反映毛泽东思想学习班的伟大成果，我们开辟了《在毛泽东思想学习班里》这个专栏，希望全国无产阶级革命派和广大读者把办好学习班的经验和收获，写成短小精悍的通讯、故事、散文等寄给我们。让我们共同努力，把这个专栏办好。
    老队长想通了
    不久以前，河南民权县人和公社金狮大队第八队队长耿彦茂，抱着一肚子委屈来到学习班。他想：自己是苦水里生，苦水里长，哪一天不是在想社会主义，盼社会主义，干社会主义？从解放战争到公社化，十几年来，没有功劳总有苦劳吧！怎么无产阶级文化大革命一来，又是大字报，又是批判会，不光批评自己是“主观主义”，还说自己“挖社会主义墙脚”。我这个队长还能当吗？
    在学习班里，这个老队长和贫下中农社员一起学习毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”和“不负责任，怕负责任，不许人讲话，老虎屁股摸不得，凡是采取这种态度的人，十个就有十个要失败”等教导，对照检查自己的言行。他认识到自己过去确实有吃老本的思想，总觉得自己有功；在十几年的工作中，主观主义很严重，好训人，听不进群众的意见，不虚心接受批评。他想，现在社员们在这方面贴自己的大字报，真是打中了要害，对自己是很大的帮助。他想通了这个问题，就放下了第一个思想包袱。
    但是，耿彦茂对群众说他“挖社会主义墙脚”这一条，却老想不通。
    接着，毛泽东思想学习班又引导大家学习毛主席的一段语录，结合本单位的一件事例，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论。耿彦茂根据毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，检查了他在国家三年暂时经济困难时期的思想状况和工作表现。这个时期，自己执行了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义黑货，这不就是挖社会主义的墙脚吗？他越想越清楚地认识到，千错万错，都错在一个“私”字上，千仇万恨，都应该集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。
    耿彦茂思想通了，就根据毛主席关于“实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正”的教导，从学习班回来的第二天，立即召开社员大会，向群众作检查，公开向群众承认了错误，并狠批了“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货。耿彦茂的行动得到了广大社员的热烈赞扬。在他的带动下，这个队破除了旧的记工办法，实行了大寨式的社会主义劳动管理制度。从此，干群关系更加融洽了，革命和生产都出现了新气象。　本报通讯员
