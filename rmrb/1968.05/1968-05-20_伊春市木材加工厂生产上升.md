The Revolutionary Committee of the Yichun City Wood Processing Factory in Heilongjiang Province, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, has led all revolutionary workers in the factory to focus on class struggle, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, promote the ideological revolution of the people, and drive the development of production. Preliminary statistics show that since this year, the output of this factory has increased by more than twenty percent compared to the same period last year.

In the past, the copper valves needed by this factory were all imported, and the capitalist roaders within the factory also exaggerated the technology of manufacturing such valves. During the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the people, and only the people, are the creators of world history" and "self-reliance." They fiercely criticized the reactionary fallacies of "technology first" and "experts managing the factory" spread by Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in this factory. With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, they took the initiative to conduct trials and, after repeated research, successfully manufactured copper valves containing aluminum-iron alloy. The quality of these valves exceeds the imported standards.

    伊春市木材加工厂生产上升
    黑龙江省伊春市木材加工厂革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，领导全厂广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展。据初步统计，今年以来，这个厂的制材量比去年同期增长了百分之二十以上。
    过去，这个厂需用的铜阀门一向依靠进口，厂内的走资派也把制造这种阀门的技术吹得神乎其神。在革命大批判中，广大革命职工学习了毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”和“自力更生”的伟大教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和本厂走资派散布的“技术第一”、“专家治厂”等反动谬论，用自力更生的革命精神，自己动手，进行试制，经过反复研究，终于成功地制造出含有铝铁合金的铜阀门，质量超过进口水平。
