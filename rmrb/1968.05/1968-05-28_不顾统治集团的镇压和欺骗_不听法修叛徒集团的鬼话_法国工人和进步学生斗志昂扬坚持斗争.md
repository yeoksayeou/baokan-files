The revolutionary struggle of French workers and students, unprecedented in its ferocity, is shaking the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie. The ruling class's attempt to divide and weaken the fighting ranks of workers and students through minor economic concessions has failed. The revisionists and the yellow union leaders are intensifying their sabotage of the workers' and students' struggle, which is widely condemned by progressive workers and students in France. Workers in many important factories and enterprises are ignoring the yellow unions' call to return to work and are passing resolutions to continue the struggle.

The nationwide strike by French workers, surging like a tidal wave, entered its tenth day on May 27. More than ten million workers, one-fifth of France's population, continue to occupy more than half of the country's factories and mines, fighting vigorously to maintain their strike. From the coal mines in northern France to the port of Marseille in the south, from Bordeaux in the west to Strasbourg on the French-German border, revolutionary red flags flutter over the factory buildings, and teams of workers patrol the occupied factories and mines. France's railways, ports, airports, and postal services remain paralyzed. The French monopolistic bourgeoisie is suffering increasingly heavy blows.

At the same time, French students, embodying a fearless revolutionary spirit, defied the government's ban on demonstrations and launched wave after wave of protest marches, bravely counterattacking the reactionary police's repression. In cities like Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Strasbourg, more and more young students are following the example of Paris students, bravely leaving their campuses to take to the streets and challenge the decaying capitalist system. Paris students have called for a nationwide demonstration on the afternoon of May 27. They issued a statement emphasizing that the student struggle should be conducted within the framework of "denying and opposing the capitalist system" and should be linked to the workers' struggle to "overthrow the old production relations and transform the economic structure."

The French ruling class hates and fears the increasingly intense and unprecedented revolutionary struggle of French workers and students. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou exclaimed on May 27 that France's "current crisis" is of "extremely serious" nature. Paul Huvelin, chairman of the National Committee of the French Employers' Federation, trembled with fear, saying that the French capitalists' primary demand at present is "social peace."

Pompidou convened two days and nights of tense meetings with representatives of capitalists and leaders of various yellow unions on May 25 and 26. Under the immense pressure of the heroic struggle of French workers and students, to soften the workers' fighting spirit and divide and weaken the unity of workers and students, French monopolistic capitalists made some minor economic concessions, such as agreeing to raise the wages of private enterprise workers by ten percent. The French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the revisionists, and other yellow unions slavishly agreed. Pompidou joyfully announced on the morning of May 27 that an "agreement" had been reached with the leaders of various yellow unions.

The Political Bureau of the French revisionist group, acting on the instructions of the French ruling class, immediately issued a statement on May 27, attacking the just struggle of French students and openly ordering its members and French workers not to support and participate in the large demonstration planned by French students in the afternoon of May 27. The union leaders of the revisionists eagerly rushed to various large factories and enterprises to propagate the "agreement" they had reached with the capitalists, attempting to stop the workers' struggle and immediately resume work.

However, workers in many important factories and enterprises in France did not listen to the revisionists and other yellow union leaders' lies and held meetings to decide to continue the strike. Seguy, a member of the Political Bureau of the revisionists and general secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, personally went to the Renault car factory in the Paris suburbs to pressure workers to resume work, but the workers' response was: We will continue the strike and fight on. More than sixty thousand workers of the largest automobile monopoly in France, the Renault car company, rejected the so-called "agreement" reached by the yellow union leaders with the capitalists and continued to occupy the company's factories in various places. Workers at the largest international airport in France, Paris Orly Airport, the largest synthetic fiber factory in France, Rhodia Setaz-Ves Textile Factory, the aircraft manufacturing plant of the French Southern Aircraft Company, the Berliet truck factory, and many large factories and enterprises in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, and other places decided to continue the strike. Paris power workers, who had already occupied the power plants, also expressed their protest by intermittently cutting off the power supply. Tens of thousands of progressive workers and students in France condemned the shameful actions of the revisionists and other yellow union leaders in betraying the interests of the working class.

The people of France, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, are awakening anew. No matter how hard various traitors and scoundrels try to serve the monopolistic bourgeoisie and maintain the reactionary rule, the people of France will rise up in revolution. Even the bourgeois press in Western Europe admits this. The British *Observer* wrote on May 26: The "rebellion of the students has triggered" the rebellious spirit of the French people. Although the French General Confederation of Labor tries to "keep the workers locked in the factories, preventing them from being influenced by the revolution spreading outside," the masses' struggle has "pushed the French to the left," and "a revolutionary political force is taking shape."

    不顾统治集团的镇压和欺骗　不听法修叛徒集团的鬼话
    法国工人和进步学生斗志昂扬坚持斗争
    工人总罢工进入第十天，一千多万工人继续占领半数以上厂矿；学生决定再举行全国性示威
    新华社二十七日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人和学生空前猛烈的革命斗争的风暴，震撼着法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。法国统治集团妄图以经济上微小的让步，分化瓦解工人和学生的战斗队伍，没有得逞。法修和黄色工会头目加紧破坏工人学生斗争，受到法国进步的工人和学生的普遍谴责。许多重要工厂企业的工人不听黄色工会复工的号令，纷纷通过决议，表示要继续坚持斗争下去。
    法国工人汹涌澎湃的全国总罢工，二十七日已进入第十天。占法国全国人口五分之一的一千多万法国工人继续占领着法国半数以上的工矿企业，斗志昂扬地坚持罢工斗争。从法国北部的煤井到南部的大港马赛，从西部的波尔多到法国西德边境的斯特拉斯堡，厂房上到处飘扬着革命的红旗，一队队工人纠察队守卫着他们占领的厂矿。法国的铁路、海港、机场和邮电交通，继续陷于瘫痪状态。法国垄断资产阶级受到越来越沉重的打击。
    与此同时，法国学生发扬了不畏强暴的革命精神，不顾法国政府禁止示威的法令，掀起了一浪高于一浪的示威怒潮，英勇地反击反动军警的镇压。在里昂、波尔多、图卢兹、斯特拉斯堡等许多城市，越来越多的青年学生以巴黎学生为榜样，勇敢地冲出校门，走上街头，向腐朽的资本主义制度挑战。巴黎的学生已号召法国学生在二十七日下午举行全国性示威。他们发表声明，强调学生的斗争要在“否定和反对资本主义制度的斗争范围内进行”，要同“劳动者推翻（旧的）生产关系和改造经济结构”的斗争联系起来。
    法国统治集团对于日益高涨、空前激烈的法国工人和学生的革命斗争恨得要死，怕得要命。法国总理蓬皮杜二十七日惊呼法国“目前危机”具有“非常严重的性质”。法国垄断资本家的组织——法国雇主联合会全国委员会主席保罗·于维兰则胆战心惊地说，法国资本家目前最主要的要求是，“社会太平”。
    蓬皮杜二十五日和二十六日召集了资本家的代表和法国各黄色工会的头子举行了两天两夜紧张的会议。在法国工人学生英勇斗争的强大压力下，为了软化工人的斗志，分化瓦解工人和学生的团结，法国垄断资本家在经济上作了一些微小的让步，如同意提高私营企业工人的工资百分之十等。法修控制的法国总工会和其他一些黄色工会奴颜婢膝地表示同意。蓬皮杜二十七日清晨兴高采烈地宣告同各黄色工会头子“达成协议”。
    法国修正主义集团的“政治局”秉承法国统治集团的意旨，二十七日马上再次发表声明，攻击法国学生的正义斗争，并且公然命令它的党员和法国工人不要支持和参加法国学生预定在二十七日下午举行的大示威。法修的工会头目也急不可待地分头到各大工厂企业，宣传他们同资本家达成的“协议”，妄图要工人停止斗争，马上复工。
    可是，法国许多重要工厂企业的工人不听法修和其他黄色工会头子的鬼话，纷纷开会决定继续罢工。法修的政治局委员兼法国总工会总书记塞居伊，亲自跑到巴黎郊区的雷诺汽车厂去压工人复工，工人的回答却是：我们要坚持罢工，继续斗争下去。法国最大的汽车垄断企业——雷诺汽车公司的六万多工人否决了黄色工会头子同资本家达成的所谓“协议”，继续占领着这家公司在各地的工厂。法国最大的国际机场——巴黎奥利机场，法国最大的人造纤维工厂——罗迪亚塞塔—韦斯纺织厂，法国南方飞机公司飞机制造厂，贝利埃卡车厂，以及巴黎、里昂、马赛、南特等地许多大工厂企业的工人都决定坚持罢工。早已占领了发电厂的巴黎电力工人，还以间歇停电的行动表示抗议。成千成万的法国进步工人和学生，纷纷谴责法修和其他黄色工会头目出卖工人阶级利益的可耻行径。
    有着巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国人民正处在新的觉醒之中。不管形形色色的叛徒工贼如何竭力为垄断资产阶级效劳，维护反动的统治，法国人民总是要起来革命的。甚至西欧资产阶级的报刊，对此也不得不承认。英国《观察家报》二十六日就写道：法国“学生们的造反已触发了”法国人民的造反精神。法国总工会虽然力图把“工人封锁在工厂里，不让他们受到在外面蔓延的革命的影响”，但是群众的斗争已经把法国人“推向左转了”，“一个革命的政治力量正在形成”。
