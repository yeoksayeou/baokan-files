Lanzhou Refinery Launches Campaign to Promote Revolution and Production

	The revolutionary workers of Lanzhou Refinery consciously observe socialist labor discipline, and production efficiency continues to improve. Since January, the amount of crude oil processed and the four main products—gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil—have all exceeded the state plan month by month.

	Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 8—Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the factory, the Revolutionary Committee of Lanzhou Refinery has led all revolutionary workers in the factory to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, earnestly carrying out Chairman Mao's great policy of "promoting revolution and production." The revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory is excellent. Currently, all 80-plus units from top to bottom in the factory have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. In terms of production, since January, the amount of crude oil processed and the four main products—gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil—have all exceeded the state plan month by month.

	The revolutionary workers of Lanzhou Refinery firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and they vigorously carry out class struggle, using revolution to lead and promote production. With deep hatred for the enemies of the proletariat, the revolutionary workers closely link the actual class struggle in the factory, conduct in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and severely criticize the revisionist fallacies of "exploitation is beneficial," "class struggle is extinguished," and "good production is good politics" propagated by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They also severely criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the revisionist party line, and the capitalist management methods they promoted.

	Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The factory Revolutionary Committee organized all revolutionary workers in the factory to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. By recalling the history of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and linking it with the actual class struggle in the factory, the class consciousness and the consciousness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary workers were further heightened. Everyone deeply realized that although the Revolutionary Committee has been established, class struggle has not stopped. The enemies of the proletariat are not willing to accept their own destruction, and they will still struggle desperately. We must maintain a high level of revolutionary vigilance and always expose and smash their plots. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the factory Revolutionary Committee led all revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, exposing a handful of bad elements hiding in dark corners, stirring up trouble, and sabotaging the revolution and production. They exposed their evil plots to restore capitalism. Through this fierce class struggle, the newly born Revolutionary Committee was powerfully defended and consolidated, the revolutionary workers were deeply educated, the revolutionary spirit and production enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers were greatly aroused, and the good situation was further developed.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in January this year, Lanzhou Refinery immediately launched a high tide of holding and improving Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory. The factory Revolutionary Committee, sub-factories, workshops, departments, teams, and families all held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering the entire factory. They became the classrooms for the revolutionary workers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and the battleground for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. So far, the factory has held 129 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 7,500 workers participating in the study. Through the study in the classes, the revolutionary workers' spiritual outlook has been completely renewed. They are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and have launched a high tide of promoting revolution and production. In January and February this year, the weather was extremely cold, bringing many difficulties to the oil refining production. To produce more petroleum products for the country, the revolutionary workers braved the cold and overcame numerous difficulties, successfully restarting the production of six sets of oil refining equipment after maintenance.

	In the past, some workers in this factory were influenced by the anarchist trend of thought and did not observe labor discipline well. After criticizing and repudiating revisionism in the study classes, everyone's consciousness was raised, and they consciously used socialist labor discipline to discipline themselves. Labor discipline was greatly strengthened, and production efficiency continued to improve.

　　兰州炼油厂掀起抓革命促生产高潮
　　广大革命职工自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，生产效率不断提高，一月份以来，原油加工量和汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油四种主要产品，月月超额完成国家计划
    新华社兰州八日电　兰州炼油厂革命委员会，在驻厂人民解放军的帮助下，带领全厂广大革命职工，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，全厂革命和生产形势一片大好。目前，这个厂从上到下八十多个单位，已经全部实现了在毛泽东思想原则基础上的革命大联合和革命的三结合；生产方面，一月以来，原油加工量和汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油四种主要产品，月月都超额完成了国家计划。
    兰州炼油厂的革命职工，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争，用革命统帅生产、带动生产。广大革命职工怀着对无产阶级的敌人的无比仇恨，紧密结合本厂的阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“生产好就是政治好”等反革命修正主义谬论，狠揭狠批了他们所推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线、修正主义建党路线和资本主义的办厂路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”厂革命委员会组织全厂革命职工认真学习了毛主席这一最新指示，通过回忆无产阶级文化大革命中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，联系本厂的阶级斗争现实，更进一步提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。大家深刻地认识到：革命委员会成立了，但阶级斗争并没有停止，无产阶级的敌人决不甘心于自己的灭亡，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。我们必须保持高度的革命警惕，随时识破和粉碎他们的阴谋诡计。在毛主席最新指示的指引下，厂革命委员会带领广大革命职工向无产阶级的敌人发起猛烈进攻，挖出了一小撮躲在阴暗角落里，煽阴风，点邪火，破坏革命，破坏生产的坏家伙，揭露了他们企图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。通过这场激烈的阶级斗争，有力地保卫和巩固了新生的革命委员会，深刻地教育了广大革命职工，大大激发了广大革命职工的革命斗志和生产积极性，进一步发展了大好形势。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”兰州炼油厂革命委员会在今年一月成立后，立即在全厂掀起了一个大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的高潮。厂革委会办，分厂办，车间办，科室办，班组办，家属办，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及全厂，成了广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，斗私批修的战场。到目前为止，全厂已经举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一百二十九期，参加学习的职工达七千五百多人次。广大革命职工通过在学习班的学习，精神面貌焕然一新。他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，掀起了抓革命促生产的高潮。今年一、二月间，天气严寒，给炼油生产带来了许多困难。广大革命职工为了多给国家生产石油产品，冒着严寒，战胜重重困难，先后使六套炼油装置在检修后顺利开工生产。
    过去，这个厂有些职工受无政府主义思潮的影响，对劳动纪律遵守不够。经过在学习班斗私批修，大家提高了觉悟，自觉地用社会主义劳动纪律来约束自己，劳动纪律大大加强，生产效率不断提高。
