To our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao:

The 28 million heroic sons and daughters of Liaoning, who are infinitely loyal to you, are filled with boundless joy as we report to you, the reddest of the red suns in our hearts: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which you personally initiated and led, has achieved decisive victories in Liaoning, an important industrial base of our motherland. The Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City have been born in glory and triumph!

On this day of great joy and celebration, the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary youngsters, and revolutionary masses have so much to say to you! They have countless songs of praise to sing to you! A thousand words, ten thousand words cannot express our infinite love and admiration for you! A thousand songs, ten thousand songs cannot express our infinite faith and loyalty to you! A thousand words and ten thousand songs, a thousand melodies and ten thousand tunes, all converge into one most beautiful wish: We wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Liaoning is a strategic stronghold of our motherland, where class struggle has always been extremely sharp and complex. In the dark old society, the heroic sons and daughters of Liaoning, under the radiant light of your great thoughts, waged an unyielding struggle against the evil class enemies. The "Mass Grave" in Fushun buried the loyal bones of tens of thousands of Chinese people; the "Tomb of Ten Thousand Loyalists" in Lushun is inscribed with countless class hatred and national grievances! Every time we recall the past struggles, and compare them with today's liberation, how can we not be filled with boundless love for you!

The "September 18 Incident" sparked the flames of war, and the mountains and rivers of Liaoning became a colony of the Japanese invaders. It was you who raised the banner of the national liberation war against Japan, issuing the battle cry of "Fight to survive, surrender to perish," "Fight to the Yalu River, recover all lost lands." You ignited the flames of resistance across the country, leading the people to smash class capitulationism and national capitulationism, and defeating the Japanese imperialist aggressors!

We had just been liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders when the traitor Chiang Kai-shek started a civil war, extending his claws to Northeast China. It was your close comrade-in-arms, our Vice Chairman Lin, who resolutely carried out your personally devised strategy of "Establishing a solid Northeast base," smashing the rightist capitulationism of Peng Dehuai, the black henchman of the Chinese Khrushchev. The heroic sons and daughters of the Northeast battlefields, under your and Vice Chairman Lin's personal command, launched three campaigns south of the river and four defenses of Lianjiang, defeating the "elite" troops of the U.S.-Chiang forces. The Liaoshen Campaign, which shook the world, "swept away thousands of troops like a mat," liberating all of Northeast China and laying the foundation for the burial of the "Chiang Dynasty."

The five-star red flag had just been raised when the ferocious American imperialists launched a mad invasion of Korea, bringing the war to the Yalu River. It was you who raised the banner of proletarian internationalism, issuing the great call of "Resist U.S. Aggression, Aid Korea, Defend the Motherland." The people of Liaoning and the people of the whole country, guarding the eastern gate of the motherland, sent their finest sons, the Chinese People's Volunteers, crossing the Yalu River, joining the Korean people, and defeating the American paper tiger.

In the new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it was your proletarian revolutionary line that continuously smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, guiding us from victory to victory. We enthusiastically responded to your great call for agricultural collectivization, steadfastly taking the bright path of socialist collectivization. We held high the red banner of the "Anshan Constitution" you personally formulated, remembering your teaching of "The humble are the wisest, the noble are the most foolish," insisting on the leadership of proletarian politics, and launching mass movements. We will never forget that in the "ten thousand horses galloping" years of the Great Leap Forward, you personally inspected Liaoning. Your great voice is always echoing in our ears. Your wise instructions forever inspire us to march forward to victory!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With the foresight of the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, you initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world. The revolutionary masses of Liaoning, the revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses, with hearts of loyalty to defend you, under the inspiration of the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster issued nationwide with your personal approval, resolutely responded to your call to "Bombard the Headquarters," holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," riding the "January Revolution" wind, launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

In this sharp, intense, and complex class struggle, the handful of biggest capitalist roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning, in order to save their doomed fate, used all kinds of counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, brutally suppressing the revolutionary movement, inciting the masses to fight each other, desperately shifting the direction of the struggle, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames you ignited.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At every critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning, it was you who made wise decisions, pointing out the direction of the struggle for us, and it was the radiance of your great thoughts that illuminated our path forward. After two years of arduous struggle, we finally exposed the traitors, spies, and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Ma Mingfang, Gu Zhuoxin, Yu Ping, and Zhou Huan, who were agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Northeast China and Liaoning. We smashed their evil plot to restore capitalism and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, you issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses. The People's Liberation Army, which you personally created and led, and which is directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, immediately dispatched tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering factories, enterprises, schools, government agencies, and rural communes to propagate, organize, and arm the masses with your brilliant thoughts. Standing shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses, they fought against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The People's Liberation Army, following your great strategic deployment, actively helped us organize and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination under revolutionary principles, and performed new meritorious deeds in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Looking back at the past and the present, your brilliant thoughts have illuminated our revolutionary path. Your brilliant thoughts have guided us to achieve one victory after another. Following you is happiness, following you is victory.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Dear Chairman Mao, we are determined to learn from the shining example of Vice Chairman Lin, to be infinitely loyal to you, to your brilliant thoughts, to your proletarian revolutionary line, and to the proletarian headquarters headed by you and with Vice Chairman Lin as your deputy. We will make the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of your brilliant thoughts our lifelong mission. We will definitely hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and transform our worldview. Your proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of all our work, and we will definitely turn Liaoning into a blazing school of Mao Zedong Thought!

Dear Chairman Mao! You taught us: "Never forget class struggle." Liaoning is on the front line of national defense and is an important industrial base of our motherland. We must firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, launch a proactive offensive against class enemies, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and smash the rightist reversal wind. We must deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning, and expose the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries! We must a thousand times, ten thousand times heighten our revolutionary vigilance, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and smash all sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies. We must cherish the newly born revolutionary committees like our eyes, maintain their proletarian revolutionary authority, and resolutely smash all plots of class enemies to shake and overthrow the proletarian red political power!

Dear Chairman Mao! Your series of latest instructions are the highest program for us to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our units. We will definitely respond to your great call of "Support the Army and Love the People," unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight with them, and achieve victory with them, further consolidating the iron wall in the great waves of class struggle. We will definitely respond to your great call of "Grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," strive for the best, and strive for double victories in revolution and production. We will definitely implement your series of latest instructions in all aspects, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

With red hearts turned to the sun, we sing "The East Is Red" with all our hearts. The heroic sons and daughters of Liaoning, a thousand times, ten thousand times, sincerely wish you, our most beloved and great leader, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

      无限忠于您的辽宁二千八百万英雄儿女，怀着万分喜悦的心情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳报喜：您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在祖国的重要工业基地辽宁省取得了决定性胜利，辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会，光荣地诞生了！胜利地诞生了！
      在这大喜大庆的日子里，广大工人阶级、贫下中农、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众，有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲！有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱！千句话，万句话，说不尽我们对您的无限热爱，无限崇拜！千支歌，万支歌，唱不尽我们对您的无限信仰，无限忠诚！千言万语，千歌万曲，凝成一个最最美好的祝愿：敬祝您，我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！辽宁省是祖国的战略要地，阶级斗争一向十分尖锐复杂。在那黑暗的旧社会里，辽宁的英雄儿女，在您伟大思想光辉的照耀下，同万恶的阶级敌人进行了坚贞不屈的斗争。抚顺城的“万人坑”，埋葬了成千上万中华儿女的忠骨；旅顺口的“万忠墓”，铭刻着数不尽的阶级仇和民族恨！每当我们想起过去的艰苦斗争，对比今天的翻身解放，怎能不激起对您无限热爱的深情！
      “九·一八”烽烟起，白山黑水沦为日寇的殖民地。是您，高举抗日民族解放战争的大旗，发出“战则存，和则亡”，“打到鸭绿江边，收复一切失地”的战斗号令，点燃了连天的抗日烽火，领导全国人民粉碎了阶级投降主义和民族投降主义，打败了日本帝国主义强盗！
      我们刚刚从日寇的铁蹄下解放出来，卖国贼蒋介石又挑起内战，把魔爪伸到了东北。是您的亲密战友、我们的林副统帅，坚决执行了您亲自制订的“建立巩固的东北根据地”的英明决策，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑干将彭真的右倾投降主义。东北疆场上的英雄儿女，在您和林副统帅的亲自指挥下，三下江南，四保临江，把美蒋“王牌”军打得落花流水。震惊世界的辽沈战役，
  “横扫千军如卷席”，一举解放了全东北，为埋葬“蒋家王朝”奠定了胜利的基础。
      五星红旗刚刚升起，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，又发动了疯狂的侵朝战争，把战火烧到了鸭绿江边。是您，高举无产阶级国际主义的大旗，发出“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的伟大号召。守卫在祖国东北门户的辽宁人民和全国人民一起，派出了自己的优秀儿女中国人民志愿军，雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民一道，打得美帝这个纸老虎现了原形。
      在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期，是您的无产阶级革命路线不断粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。我们热烈响应您农业合作化的伟大号召，坚持走社会主义集体化的光明大道。我们高举您亲手制订的“鞍钢宪法”的红旗，牢记您“卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢”的教导，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。我们永远不会忘记，在那“万马战犹酣”的大跃进年代里，您亲临辽宁视察。您的伟大声音，时刻在我们耳边回响。您的英明指示，永远激励着我们胜利前进！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您高瞻远瞩，以当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家的胆略和气魄，发动和领导了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。辽宁无产阶级革命派、革命的工人、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众，怀着誓死保卫您的赤胆忠心，在您亲手批发的全国第一张马列主义大字报的鼓舞下，坚决响应您“炮打司令部”的动员令，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，乘“一月革命”的东风，向党内一小撮走资派发起了猛烈的进攻。
      在这场尖锐、激烈、复杂的阶级大搏斗中，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在东北和辽宁的代理人，他们为了挽救自己行将灭亡的命运，施尽了种种反革命两面派的伎俩，残酷镇压革命运动，挑动群众斗群众，拚命转移斗争大方向，妄图扑灭您点燃的革命烈火。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！辽宁省无产阶级文化大革命的每一个关键时刻，都是您作出了英明的决策，给我们指明了斗争的方向，都是您的伟大思想的光辉，照亮了我们前进的道路。经过两年的艰苦奋战，我们终于把中国赫鲁晓夫在东北和辽宁的代理人马明方、顾卓新、喻屏、周桓等大叛徒、大特务和党内一小撮走资派揪了出来，粉碎了他们妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，夺取了辽宁无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，您发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召。您亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，闻风而动，立即派出成千上万个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工矿、企业、学校、机关和农村人民公社，用您的光辉思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众肩并肩，心连心，与党内一小撮走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争。亲人解放军紧跟您的伟大战略部署，积极帮助我们联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，在革命的原则下，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立了新功。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！忆往昔，看今朝，您的光辉思想，照亮了我们的革命航道。您的光辉思想，指引我们取得了一个又一个胜利。紧跟着您就是幸福，紧跟着您就是胜利。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”敬爱的毛主席，我们决心学习林副主席的光辉榜样，无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，无限忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，无限忠于以您为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，把学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫您的光辉思想，当作我们毕生的战斗任务。我们一定要大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，改造世界观。您的无产阶级革命路线是我们一切工作的生命线，我们坚决把辽宁办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。辽宁地处国防前哨，又是祖国的重要工业基地。我们要狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人展开主动的进攻，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案黑风。我们要深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他在东北、辽宁的代理人彻底批倒批臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来！我们一定千百倍地提高革命警惕，加强无产阶级专政，粉碎国内外阶级敌人的各种破坏活动。我们要象爱护眼珠一样爱护新生的革命委员会，维护它的无产阶级革命权威，坚决粉碎阶级敌人动摇和颠覆无产阶级红色政权的一切阴谋！
      敬爱的毛主席！您的一系列的最新指示是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最高纲领。我们一定搞好革命大批判，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改。我们一定响应您“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，和亲人解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，在阶级斗争的大风浪里，进一步巩固钢铁长城。我们一定响应您“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，鼓足干劲，力争上游，夺取革命、生产双丰收。我们一定条条落实您的一系列最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
      颗颗红心向太阳，纵情高唱《东方红》。辽宁的英雄儿女，一千遍，一万遍地最最衷心地敬祝您老人家，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
