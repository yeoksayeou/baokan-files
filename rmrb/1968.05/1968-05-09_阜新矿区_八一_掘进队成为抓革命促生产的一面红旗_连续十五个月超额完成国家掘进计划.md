The "August 1st" Tunneling Team in Fuxin Mining Area Becomes a Red Flag for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production
Continuously Exceeding the National Tunneling Plan for Fifteen Months

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 8th: The "August 1st" Tunneling Team of Xinqiu Coal Mine, Fuxin Mining Bureau, Liaoning Province, has been faithfully implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They have created an outstanding achievement of continuously exceeding the national tunneling plan for fifteen months, achieving high speed, good quality, and low cost, becoming a red flag for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the Fuxin Mining Area.

The "August 1st" Tunneling Team was established in 1958. Ninety percent of the team members are demobilized soldiers. They are a militia company in the mine. Over the years, they have consistently adhered to the "four firsts" and carried forward the "March 8th" spirit, being repeatedly evaluated as an advanced collective in the mining area and known as the "underground vanguard." Representatives of the tunneling team have gone to Beijing three times and had the honor of seeing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao twice. The revolutionary workers of the entire team, with profound proletarian feelings, persist in reading Chairman Mao's books every day, listening to Chairman Mao's words at all times, and acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they responded to Chairman Mao's call to "care about state affairs" and "carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," engaging in resolute struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They persist in doing revolution well above ground and production well below ground, and in saving money to make revolution, achieving one victory after another in revolution and production.

Putting revolution first, using revolution to change people's spiritual outlook, to guide production, and to promote production, is a major characteristic of this team in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In the past, due to the influence of the revisionist enterprise management line promoted by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, this team once exhibited phenomena such as "money as the commander," "material incentives," and "production first," emphasizing production one-sidedly and not emphasizing proletarian politics enough. During the Cultural Revolution, they raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and in conjunction with the situation, tasks, and living thoughts of workers in various periods, they fiercely criticized the series of black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in enterprise management. Everyone said: The counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the coal industry is to make us only care about production and not about politics, leading us astray. In the past, we fought economic battles, advancing one meter for personal income. Now we fight political battles, advancing one meter to contribute more to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The ideological awareness of all workers in the team has been raised, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is even greater. They carry forward the spirit of bravery and good fighting, overcoming difficulties in every possible way, thus achieving the completion and over-fulfillment of the national tunneling plan month after month.

In seizing the revolution and promoting production, this team pays great attention to strengthening class education. In a previous period, due to the influence of anarchist thinking, labor discipline in the team became lax for a while, and phenomena of being late and leaving early occurred. In this situation, the militia instructor of this team, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," organized workers to recall bitterness and sweetness, invited old workers with deep grievances to talk about mine history and family history, to recount the bitterness of the old society and the bitterness suffered from China's Khrushchev, and to talk about today's sweetness. They also organized all workers in the team to repeatedly study the brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Oppose Liberalism." Through strengthening class education and actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, the proletarian awareness of all workers in the team has been greatly raised. They voluntarily observe socialist labor discipline, and revolution and production have shown a new situation.

　　阜新矿区“八一”掘进队成为抓革命促生产的一面红旗
　　连续十五个月超额完成国家掘进计划
    据新华社沈阳八日电　辽宁省阜新矿务局新邱煤矿“八一”掘进队认真执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，创造了连续十五个月超额完成国家掘进计划的优异成绩，做到速度快，质量好，成本低，成为阜新矿区抓革命促生产的一面红旗。
    “八一”掘进队，是一九五八年成立的。全队百分之九十都是转业军人。他们是这个矿上的一个民兵连。几年来，他们始终坚持“四个第一”，发扬“三八”作风，多次被评为矿区的先进集体，被人们称为“地下尖兵”。掘进队的代表曾经三次进京，两次幸福地见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。全队革命职工怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，坚持天天读毛主席的书，时时听毛主席的话，处处遵照毛主席的指示办事。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，同党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争。他们坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，坚持节约闹革命，在革命和生产中夺得了一个又一个的胜利。
    把革命放在首位，用革命来改变人的精神面貌，来统帅生产，推动生产，是这个队抓革命，促生产的一个很大特点。过去，由于受中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派推行的修正主义企业管理路线的影响，这个队曾出现过“金钱挂帅”，“物质刺激”，“生产第一”的现象，片面强调生产，突出无产阶级政治不够。在文化大革命运动中，他们高举革命批判大旗，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，结合各个时期的形势、任务和职工的活思想，狠狠地批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派在企业管理上的一系列黑货。大家说：中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭工业方面的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，就是要我们只顾生产，不问政治，把我们引到邪路上去。我们过去打的是经济仗，多进一米道是为了个人增加收入。现在我们打的是政治仗，多进一米道，是为中国革命和世界革命多贡献一分力量。全队职工的思想觉悟提高了，革命干劲就更大。他们发扬勇敢善战的精神，千方百计地克服困难，从而做到了月月完成和超额完成国家掘进计划。
    在抓革命，促生产中，这个队十分注意加强阶级教育。前一个时期，由于无政府主义思潮的影响，队里的少数人劳动纪律一度松弛，产生迟到早退的现象。在这种情况下，这个队的民兵指导员就遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，组织职工忆苦思甜，请苦大仇深的老工人讲矿史、家史，诉旧社会的苦，诉受中国赫鲁晓夫的苦，谈今日的甜。他们还组织全队职工反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《反对自由主义》等光辉著作。通过加强阶级教育和活学活用毛主席著作，全队职工的无产阶级觉悟有了很大提高，自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，革命和生产出现了新气象。
