    Exploitation is a Crime, Deserving Death a Thousand Times Over
    Sixth Production Brigade Female Member, Yè Yùyīng

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Throughout Chinese history, the peasants have lived a life of poverty and hardship under the economic exploitation of the feudal system and the political oppression of the feudal rulers." The Chinese Khrushchev stands firmly on the side of the landlords and capitalists. At a time when we are carrying out a socialist revolution and striving to eliminate all systems of exploitation, he dares to say that "exploitation is beneficial" and "exploitation saves people." This is sheer reactionary nonsense!

    The Chinese Khrushchev advocates "exploitation is beneficial," which is clearly playing the role of a cheerleader for the exploiting classes, allowing landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists to continue riding on our backs, exploiting and oppressing us. This fully exposes his counter-revolutionary true colors.

    We poor and lower-middle peasants know all too well: exploitation is a crime, deserving death a thousand times over! Before liberation, my family generation after generation was crushed under the three big stones of usury, rent, and hired labor. Even when I was born, my family of eight had no roof over our heads and no land to call our own. We rented a landlord's house to live in and tilled fourteen mu of the landlord's fields. The whole year we toiled in the fields, facing the yellow earth and the blue sky, working hard to grow a little grain. After paying the rent, we had to borrow rice to eat. Sometimes we had to peel bark from trees, gather wild vegetables, and dig up clay to make ends meet. Yet the landlords were never satisfied. Besides the regular rent, they invented all sorts of excuses to demand extra payments. They wouldn't stop until they had squeezed every last drop of oil and blood from us poor people. Later, the wicked landlords saw that they could no longer squeeze a drop of oil from us, so they wanted to take back the land to give to others. The landlords, without lifting a finger, had full granaries and money-filled chests all year round, while our blood and sweat fed them to be fat and prosperous. The Chinese Khrushchev says "exploitation is beneficial"; the benefit is in fattening the landlords and capitalists, these bloodsuckers. The Chinese Khrushchev says "exploitation saves people"; the people saved are the landlords and capitalists, this bunch of parasites.

    Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we overthrew the three major enemies and eliminated the exploitative system of man eating man. We were liberated from the exploitation and oppression of rent, usury, and hired labor, and we embarked on the socialist path. Only then did we poor and lower-middle peasants truly stand up, become masters of our own fate. The exploiting classes see this situation and are not reconciled. They always dream of regaining their lost "paradise." The Chinese Khrushchev, as the representative of the exploiting classes, for the benefit of the bloodsuckers, vigorously advocates "exploitation is beneficial," and in every possible way creates public opinion to restore capitalism for the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, attempting to undermine socialism and restore the exploitative system of man eating man, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. Chinese Khrushchev, listen: you are completely dreaming, and you will never succeed!

    剥削有罪，罪该万死
    第六生产队女社员　叶玉英
    毛主席教导我们说：“中国历代的农民，就在这种封建的经济剥削和封建的政治压迫之下，过着贫穷困苦的奴隶式的生活。”中国赫鲁晓夫完全站在地主、资本家的立场上，在我们要搞社会主义革命、消灭一切剥削制度的时候，胡说什么“剥削有功”，“剥削是救人”，真是反动透顶！
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“剥削有功”，这明明是给剥削阶级当“吹鼓手”，让地主、富农、资本家长期骑在我们头上，任意剥削和压迫我们。这就完全暴露了他的反革命真面目。
    我们贫下中农切身体会是：剥削有罪，罪该万死！解放前，我家世世代代都被高利贷、地租、雇工这三块大石头压得抬不起头来。直到我出生的时候，我家八口人，上无遮身片瓦，下无插针之土，租地主的屋住，佃地主的十四亩田种，一年到头，面向黄土，背朝青天，勤扒苦做，收点粮食，每年把租一交，就要借米下锅，甚至剥树皮，找野菜，挖观音土过日子。可是，地主还不满足，除了正租以外，还要巧立名目，额外加租，不把我们穷人的油榨干，血喝尽，他们不死心。后来，万恶的地主看到在我们身上再也榨不出一滴油来，就要把田抽回去给别人种。地主不劳而获，一年四季都是粮满仓，钱满柜，我们穷人的血汗把他们喂得肥头胖耳。中国赫鲁晓夫说“剥削有功”，功就在喂肥了地主、资本家这些吸血鬼；中国赫鲁晓夫说“剥削是救人”，救的是地主、资本家这群寄生虫。
    伟大领袖毛主席领导我们打倒了三大敌人，消灭了人吃人的剥削制度，把我们从地租、高利贷、雇工的剥削压榨下面解放出来，走上了社会主义道路。我们贫下中农才真正翻了身，当了家，作了主。剥削阶级看到这种情况是不甘心的，他们时时刻刻都梦想着夺回他们失去的“天堂”。中国赫鲁晓夫这个剥削阶级的总代表，为了吸血鬼的利益，就大力宣扬“剥削有功”，千方百计为地主、富农和资本家复辟资本主义大造舆论，妄想搞垮社会主义，恢复人吃人的剥削制度，使我们贫下中农受二遍罪。中国赫鲁晓夫你听着：你完全是白日做梦，永远办不到！
