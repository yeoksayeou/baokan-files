	Hanoi, May 5 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, from April 29 to May 2, the people's liberation armed forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, engaged in multiple battles with the enemy. Preliminary reports indicate that they annihilated 1,350 enemy troops, including 1,050 U.S. invaders.

	The report states that on April 29, local forces in Cam Lu District ambushed the enemy on Highway 9 west of Dong Ha, completely annihilating one platoon each of U.S. and puppet forces and destroying two tanks. At the same time, the anti-aircraft units of the people's liberation armed forces shot down and damaged three enemy aircraft each in the Dong Ha and Kon Tum regions.

	In the afternoon of the 30th, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce ambush on four companies of puppet troops north of Dong Ha. Preliminary reports indicate that they completely annihilated one company and severely damaged two others. At 5 PM, the people's liberation armed forces again ambushed a group of U.S. troops on the highway, annihilating over 100 enemy troops.

	On the morning of May 1, the U.S. invaders dispatched nearly two battalions of U.S. troops and one armored battalion each of U.S. and puppet forces, dividing into multiple routes in an attempt to reopen the supply lines. The main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units of the people's liberation armed forces closely coordinated and launched fierce attacks on the enemy troops. In the northeast of Dong Ha, intense battles raged from 6 AM to 5 PM. The people's liberation armed forces repelled the enemy's attacks and annihilated many enemy troops. Under the powerful offensive of the people's liberation armed forces, the remaining enemy troops fled in disarray. The people's liberation armed forces pursued and annihilated another batch of enemy troops, with enemy corpses scattered across the beaches and fields. After a day of fierce battles, local military and civilian forces annihilated over 500 U.S. troops.

	That night, the people's liberation armed forces shelled Vung Tau Port, setting three enemy transport ships, a warehouse, and an oil depot on fire.

	On the morning of May 2, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on two companies of U.S. troops reconnoitering the Da Do and Dinh Truong regions and one company of enemy troops heading to the Upper Yi region, annihilating over 150 enemy troops. In the morning and afternoon of the same day, the enemy launched frantic counterattacks, which were all repelled by the people's liberation armed forces, resulting in many enemy casualties.
