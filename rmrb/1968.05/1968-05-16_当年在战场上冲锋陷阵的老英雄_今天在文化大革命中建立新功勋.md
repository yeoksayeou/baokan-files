The old heroes who once charged into battle are now creating new merits in the Cultural Revolution.

The People's Liberation Army's battle heroes, model workers, and active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works, who are carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks in Liaoning, are closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly supporting the broad masses of revolutionary rebels, and launching fierce attacks on class enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 15 - The People's Liberation Army's battle heroes, model workers, and active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works, who are fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks in Liaoning, are closely following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With high spirits, they firmly support and unite with the broad masses of revolutionary rebels, and actively and continuously launch attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, creating new merits. In the face of new battles,

These old heroes, who once charged into battle on the smoky battlefield, deeply realize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution under socialist conditions. They must, with the revolutionary spirit of defeating the reactionary army on the battlefield, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and win this political battle. The great leader Chairman Mao issued the battle command in the great call to "Bombard the Headquarters," and the heroes immediately took action, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launching fierce attacks on the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took up the pen of struggle, and wherever they went, they stirred up a wave of revolutionary criticism. They denounced with both mouth and pen the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Liaoning who were frantically promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Battle hero Zhao Xingyuan regarded the revolutionary criticism as a glorious task to defend Chairman Mao and, on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks, carried out revolutionary criticism with the broad masses. Battle hero Huang Shouhe, with a heart of loyalty to defend Chairman Mao, stayed up all night writing critical articles. In a period, he published 48 critical articles in the capital and local newspapers. These articles, like a barrage of bullets, fiercely shot at China's Khrushchev's bourgeois headquarters.

The great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the leftist broad masses, and the heroes immediately, together with their units, went to the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks. Dong Cunrui's former close comrade-in-arms and battle hero Zhao Shunyi was particularly excited when he received the battle command to go to the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks. From more than twenty years of revolutionary practice following Chairman Mao's southward and northward campaigns, he deeply felt that every time Chairman Mao issued a battle command, the Chinese revolution would advance a step. Today, when he went to carry out Chairman Mao's new battle command, he raised the red book high and swore to Chairman Mao: He would definitely, like Dong Cunrui, go wherever Chairman Mao pointed and fight there. To defend Chairman Mao, he would not hesitate to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, and to be crushed to pieces. When a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the Liaoning-Shenyang region, in order to protect themselves, incited the masses to fight each other and attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhao Shunyi, with a clear banner, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to help the revolutionary masses, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, distinguished between enemies and ourselves, united to fight the enemy, and resolutely smashed the enemy's sabotage plots. To enable the revolutionary youngsters to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, he pinned the Mao badges sent from all over the country onto the chests of the revolutionary youngsters and said earnestly: "Although this struggle is a political battle, it is much sharper and more complex than fighting with guns. One must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle to achieve victory!" Over the past year, he, together with the revolutionary youngsters, fought the most resolute struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and made contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning Province.

Battle hero Zhao Xingyuan, who, in the Liaoshen Campaign personally directed by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, led all the company's comrades to bravely charge and kill, captured the high ground of the water tower outside Jinzhou, and won the battle to liberate Jinzhou. Today, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, he again led the troops to the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks and, together with the broad revolutionary masses of Jinzhou who had once fought side by side, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launched fierce attacks on China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Jinzhou region, achieving one victory after another. After revolutionary committees were established in many factories, offices, and schools, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle" and, with local living class struggle examples as teaching materials, educated the members of the revolutionary committees and the broad masses to heighten their awareness of class struggle. He, together with the revolutionary committees, led the masses to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat without stopping.

The officers and soldiers of the Navy unit where the advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works, hero An Yemin, once served, discovered on a certain support-agriculture front line that a controlled fishery boss incited some people to attack and frame revolutionary cadres, attempting to muddy the waters and seize the leadership of the production team. The heroes of the unit, relying closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, organized the broad revolutionary masses to launch a counterattack on the class enemy and exposed this bad element. The poor and lower-middle peasants said emotionally: "Every time there is a critical moment in class struggle, the PLA always stands up for us. The PLA is indeed the backbone of us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Treating the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental task of the "three supports, two military" work

The battle heroes fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, always regard the propagation and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental task of the "three supports, two military" work.

Wang Lichang, a model worker in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Shenyang Military Region who has long been fighting on the support-agriculture front lines, and deputy political commissar of the Newjin County Military Sub-district, is always quick to act and enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's every latest instruction. To timely convey Chairman Mao's voice to the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, his footsteps have covered the mountains in the northern part of Newjin County. Regardless of day or night, regardless of the distance, as soon as Wang Lichang heard Chairman Mao's latest instruction, he immediately went down to the countryside with his comrades to propagate it. When the enemy spread many rumors to cut off his contact with the masses, he fearlessly and firmly, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, struck down the enemy and better connected with the broad masses. With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he was able to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions more timely.

On a certain border defense line in Northeast China, the "Old Red Army Propaganda Station" of the Shenyang Air Force, an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works, also made great contributions to the propagation and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This propaganda station was set up by seven old red army soldiers with gray hair. They deeply felt from their decades of revolutionary struggle that following Chairman Mao would definitely lead to victory. In the most intense days of struggle in the previous period, they clearly knew that using Mao Zedong Thought to support the Red Guards and the revolutionary rebels was the greatest support. Therefore, they established the "Old Red Army Propaganda Station." With full political enthusiasm, they began a new battle. Wu Xiongsen, who once served as the communications platoon leader of the First Red Army during the Long March, often conveyed the orders of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao. Every time an order was conveyed, the Red Army would win a battle and cross a dangerous pass. Today, he, like conveying the battle orders of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in the past, energetically put on the propaganda box, took the water bottle and dry food, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, and went deep into factories, schools, and remote production teams to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, encouraging the broad revolutionary masses to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the antagonistic sentiment between the two factions of workers in a certain factory was relatively serious. Old Red Army soldiers such as Zhong Yuantan, who once stood guard for the historic Zunyi Conference, sat with the masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two large factions that cannot coexist." Through study, they helped the two factions of masses to see clearly the direction of the struggle and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity, fighting the enemy together. The "Old Red Army Propaganda Station" also helped some revolutionary teachers and students in schools to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and started the movement of "resuming classes and making revolution." In the class struggle, tempering the red heart

Chairman Mao teaches us: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls and is to solve the problem of people's worldview.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful."

These heroes, who once galloped on the battlefield and achieved many victories, on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks, always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions, and while launching fierce attacks on class enemies, they never stop fighting against the "enemies" hidden in their minds. Battle hero Huang Shouhe led the military training work of seven schools in a certain region. Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, most of the schools achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and revolutionary teachers and students praised the military training work highly. In the midst of praise, Huang Shouhe repeatedly reminded himself not to let a hint of complacency blind his eyes and relax his vigilance against class enemies. In the sustained revolutionary criticism in the school, he widely contacted the revolutionary youngsters, slept on the same bed, ate from the same pot, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and criticized the bourgeoisie together, fighting against "selfishness" fiercely. The youngsters said emotionally: The old hero fights against selfishness and revisionism as bravely as he did in killing enemies in the past, always charging forward!

When battle hero Zhao Shunyi first went to a certain chemical factory to support the left, he saw that the struggle between the two factions of masses in the factory was very intense and thought, "The struggle is so complex, don't say the wrong words." He set a rule for himself: look more with his eyes, listen more with his ears, think more with his brain, and speak less with his mouth. As the class struggle deepened, he realized through studying the "Three Articles" that the revolutionary rebels rose up to rebel for the country not to change color, and Chairman Mao let them support the left to make the country red for ten thousand generations. The rule he set was to preserve the old capital. "Selfishness" blocked the way, and he would forget about class and class struggle and would not be able to follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize forever. Therefore, he grabbed the thought of preserving the old capital and fought a decisive battle against "selfishness" in the depths of his soul, threw away the "fear" and replaced it with "dare," closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, enthusiastically supported the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations, firmly grasped the big direction, and achieved revolutionary great unity.

The battle heroes, model workers, and active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works who are fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" tasks in Liaoning have been tested and tempered in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers of the Lei Feng Class, in summarizing their experience of participating in the "three supports, two military" work, pointed out: "In the great waves of the revolutionary mass movement, what is cultivated is the great public spirit of the proletariat, and what is tempered is the red heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao." Many battle heroes unanimously expressed their determination to, in the great winds and waves of class struggle, more diligently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implement and defend Mao Zedong Thought with their lives, and firmly advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the battle to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will create new merits for the people.

    当年在战场上冲锋陷阵的老英雄
    今天在文化大革命中建立新功勋
    在辽宁担负“三支”“两军”任务的解放军战斗英雄、工作模范和学习毛主席著作积极分子，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，坚决支持广大无产阶级革命派，向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    新华社沈阳十五日电战斗在辽宁“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军战斗英雄、工作模范和学习毛主席著作积极分子，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以昂扬的斗志，坚决支持和团结广大无产阶级革命派，主动地、不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发动进攻，建立了新的功勋。在新的战斗面前
    这些当年在硝烟弥漫的战场上冲锋陷阵的老英雄深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命是社会主义条件下的一场伟大的革命，一定要以当年在战场上压倒反动军队的革命精神，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，打赢这场政治仗。伟大统帅毛主席在《炮打司令部》的伟大号召中发出战斗命令，英雄们立即行动，坚定地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起了猛烈的进攻。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，拿起了战斗的笔，走到那里，就在那里掀起革命大批判的热潮，口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫及其在辽宁的代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。战斗英雄赵兴元把革命大批判看作是保卫毛主席的光荣战斗任务，在
  “三支”“两军”第一线上和广大群众一起开展革命大批判。战斗英雄黄丑和，怀着誓死保卫毛主席的赤胆忠心，彻夜不眠赶写批判文章，在一个时期里，就在首都和当地的报刊上发表了四十八篇批判文章。这些文章，象连珠炮似地猛烈射向中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级司令部。
    伟大统帅毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，英雄们又立即同部队一起走上了“三支”“两军”第一线。董存瑞同志生前亲密战友、战斗英雄郅顺义，接到开赴“三支”“两军”第一线的战斗命令，心情特别激动。他从二十多年跟随毛主席南征北战的革命实践中深深体会到，毛主席每发布一次战斗命令，中国革命就向前推进一步。今天，他去执行毛主席这一新的战斗命令的时候，高举着红彤彤的宝书向毛主席宣誓：一定要象董存瑞那样，毛主席指到那里，就打到那里。为了保卫毛主席，上刀山，下火海，粉身碎骨也在所不辞。当辽沈地区党内一小撮走资派为了保护自己，挑动群众斗群众，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的时候，郅顺义旗帜鲜明地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，帮助革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，分清敌我，共同对敌，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。他为了使革命小将能够紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把全国各地送给他的毛主席像章佩戴在革命小将胸前，并语重心长地说：“这场斗争虽然是打的政治仗，但比打拿枪的敌人尖锐、复杂得多。一定要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，才会取得胜利！”一年多来，他和革命小将一起，同党内一小撮走资派进行了最坚决的斗争，为辽宁省的无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。
    战斗英雄赵兴元，当年在毛主席亲自部署，林副主席直接指挥的辽沈战役中，带领全营同志奋勇冲杀，一举打下了锦州外围配水池制高点，为解放锦州立下了战功。今天在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，他又带领部队投入到
  “三支”“两军”第一线，和当年并肩战斗过的锦州市广大革命群众一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在锦州地区代理人发动猛烈的进攻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在许多工厂、机关、学校相继成立了革命委员会之后，他牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以当地活生生的阶级斗争事例为教材，教育革委会成员和广大群众，提高他们的阶级斗争观念，并和革委会一起，带领群众不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发起猛烈的进攻。
    海军学习毛主席著作先进单位、英雄安业民生前所在连的干部战士，在某地支农第一线上，发现一个被管制的渔霸挑动一部分人，打击陷害革命干部，妄图把水搅浑，乘机篡夺生产队领导权。英雄连队的指战员，紧紧依靠贫下中农，组织广大革命群众，向阶级敌人发起反击，把这个坏家伙揪了出来。贫下中农感动地说：“每到阶级斗争的节骨眼上，解放军总是为我们撑腰，解放军真是咱贫下中农的顶梁柱！”
    把落实毛主席最新指示作为“三支”“两军”工作的根本
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的战斗英雄们，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，时刻都把宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，作为“三支”“两军”工作的根本。
    长期战斗在支农第一线的沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、新金县武装部副政委王立龙，对毛主席的每一个最新指示，都是闻风而动，热情传播。为了及时把毛主席的声音传到贫下中农的心坎里，他的足迹踏遍了新金县北部的山岭。王立龙同志不管白天黑夜，不管路程多远，一听到毛主席的最新指示，就赶紧和同志们一起下乡传播。王立龙在传播最新指示时，敌人制造了许多谣言，妄图割断他和群众的联系。他毫不畏惧，坚定地和贫下中农一起，打击了敌人，更好地与广大群众取得了联系，在贫下中农的帮助下，做到了更及时地传播毛主席的最新指示。
    在东北的某边防线上，空军学习毛主席著作先进单位、沈阳空军部队某部
  “老红军宣传站”，为宣传、落实毛主席最新指示，也作出了巨大贡献。这个宣传站，是由七位鬓发斑白的老红军战士办起来的。他们从几十年的革命斗争生活中，深深体会到，紧跟毛主席就一定胜利。在前一时期斗争最激烈的日子里，他们清楚地知道，用毛泽东思想支持红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派是最大的支持，于是，成立了“老红军宣传站”。他们以饱满的政治热情，开始了新的战斗。长征时期曾担任过红一军团通信班长的老红军战士吴雄森，长征途中经常传达毛主席和林彪军团长的命令。每传达一道命令，红军就打一次胜仗，闯过一道天险。今天，他象当年传递毛主席和林副主席战斗命令那样，朝气蓬勃地背上宣传箱，带上水壶和干粮，爬山越岭，深入到工厂、学校和偏远的生产队，宣传毛主席的最新指示，鼓舞广大革命群众去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。某工厂由于党内一小撮走资派的挑动，两派群众的对立情绪比较严重。当年曾为具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议站过岗的老红军战士钟远谭等同志，就和群众坐在一起，学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”通过学习，帮助两派群众认清了斗争的大方向，很快实现了革命大联合，共同对敌。“老红军宣传站”还帮助一些学校的革命师生落实毛主席的最新指示，开始了复课闹革命。在阶级斗争中炼红心
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。
    林副主席指示我们：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    这些当年驰骋疆场、屡建战功的英雄们，在“三支”“两军”第一线上，时刻牢记毛主席的伟大教导和林副主席的重要指示，在向阶级敌人发动勇猛进攻的同时，一刻也不停顿地向潜伏在自己头脑里的“敌人”大打进攻战。战斗英雄黄丑和，领导某地区七个学校的军训工作。在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，大部分学校实现了革命的三结合，革命师生对军训工作赞不绝口。在一片赞扬声中，黄丑和反复叮咛自己，绝不能让一丝一毫的自满遮住眼睛，而放松对阶级敌人的警惕。他在学校持续开展的革命大批判中，广泛接触革命小将，和小将睡在一个地铺上，吃一个锅里的饭，一同学习毛主席著作，一起批判资产阶级，狠斗“私”心。小将们感动地说：老英雄斗私批修不减当年杀敌勇，永远打冲锋！
    战斗英雄郅顺义刚到某化工厂支左，看到厂内两派群众组织斗争很激烈，心想，斗争这样复杂，可别说错了话。他给自己订了个规矩：眼睛多看点，耳朵多听点，脑子多想点，嘴里少说点。随着阶级斗争的深入发展，他通过学习“老三篇”认识到，无产阶级革命派起来造反是为了国家不变色，毛主席让我们支左是为了江山万代红。自己订的这个规矩是为了保老本。
  “私”字挡了道，就会忘掉阶级和阶级斗争，就不能永远跟着毛主席干革命。于是，他揪住保老本的思想，在灵魂深处打了一场斗“私”的歼灭战，丢掉了“怕”字，换上了“敢”字，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，热情支持两派革命群众组织，狠抓大方向，实现了革命大联合。
    战斗在辽宁“三支”“两军”第一线上的战斗英雄、工作模范和学习毛主席著作积极分子们，在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中经受了考验，得到了锻炼。雷锋班的战士在总结他们参加“三支”“两军”工作的体会时指出：“在革命群众运动的大风浪里，培养出的是无产阶级大公精神，冶炼出来的是无限忠于毛主席的红心。”许多战斗英雄一致表示，决心在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻、誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，坚定地沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的战斗中，为人民再立新功。
