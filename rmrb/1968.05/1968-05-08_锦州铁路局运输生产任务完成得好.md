The transportation production tasks of Jinzhou Railway Bureau are well completed. Over 20,000 people across the bureau participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, significantly raising the proletarian consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle among revolutionary workers. Revolutionary criticism and struggle are unfolding everywhere in the offices, stations, workshops, and teams, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to deeply expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, resolutely eliminating their poisonous influence.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on the 7th, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, the revolutionary workers of Jinzhou Railway Bureau have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Both revolution and production have shown a very good situation. The entire bureau has held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, developed and consolidated revolutionary great alliances, and revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams have been born one after another. The transportation production situation has been getting better month by month. This year's March production indicators were better than those of January and February, and since April, various transportation production indicators have been higher than those of March.

"Navigating the ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and the people of Jinzhou Railway Bureau have been infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought above everything, greater than everything, before everything, and heavier than everything. From the offices to the stations, from the workshops to the teams, and even in the workers' dormitories and homes, everywhere is a classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works. The broad revolutionary masses, in revolutionary and production struggles, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, transform everything, and promote everything. Great Mao Zedong Thought has never been so widely popularized, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts.

After the issuance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the broad revolutionary masses of this bureau resolutely implemented them immediately. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, they held 397 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 20,000 people participating in the study. Through the study, the proletarian consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses have been significantly raised. They removed the obstacles to achieving revolutionary great alliances and launched a high tide of revolutionary great alliances across the bureau. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling cadres, helping a large number of cadres to stand up and revolutionize, rapidly promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Now, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee has been successfully born.

The broad revolutionary masses of Jinzhou Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," have set up revolutionary criticism and struggle battlefields everywhere in the offices, stations, workshops, and teams, deeply exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, resolutely eliminating their poisonous influence. They combined the revolutionary criticism and struggle with the class struggle within the bureau, exposing one by one the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who had infiltrated the Party, and carried out criticism and struggle against them. The broad revolutionary masses deeply realized that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. The class enemies will never willingly accept their doom. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, never forget class struggle, carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle deeply and persistently, take the initiative to attack the class enemies, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, criticize and expose them, and achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　全局二万多人参加毛泽东思想学习班，革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有很大提高；在机关、站段、车间、班组，到处摆开革命大批判的战场，以毛主席最新指示为武器，深入地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，坚决肃清其流毒
    据新华社沈阳七日电　锦州铁路局革命职工在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，落实毛主席的最新指示，革命和生产都出现了一派大好形势。全局通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，发展和巩固了革命大联合，革命三结合的领导班子一个接着一个地诞生。运输生产形势也一月比一月好。今年三月份的各项运输生产指标比一、二月份完成得好，四月份以来的各项运输生产指标又比三月份提高。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在两年来的无产阶级文化大革命中，锦州铁路局广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，无限忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。从机关到站段，从车间到班组，以至职工宿舍和家庭，到处都是学习毛主席著作的课堂。广大革命职工在革命和生产斗争中，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，推动一切。伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心。
    伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示下达后，这个局的广大革命职工坚决照办，立即执行。毛主席指出：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”他们在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，举办了三百九十七期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有两万多人参加了学习。通过学习，广大革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高。他们扫除了实现革命大联合的障碍，在全局掀起了革命大联合的高潮。他们遵照毛主席关于正确对待干部的指示，帮助大批干部站出来革命，迅速促进了革命的三结合。现在，锦州铁路局革命委员会已经胜利诞生。
    锦州铁路局的广大革命职工遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在机关、站段、车间、班组，到处摆开革命大批判的战场，深入地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，坚决肃清其流毒。他们把革命的大批判同本局阶级斗争结合起来，把混进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派一个个揭露出来，进行了批判和斗争。广大革命职工深刻认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越复杂，越深刻。阶级敌人决不甘心自己的灭亡。我们必须提高革命警惕，念念不忘阶级斗争，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，主动地向阶级敌人进攻，把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
