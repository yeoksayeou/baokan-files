After the Revolutionary Committee of Longchang People's Commune in Liaoning Province's Liaoyang County was established, some adjustments were made to the work of certain cadres due to work needs. Among these cadres, various active thoughts emerged. Those assigned to important positions felt they had "become officials" and needed to act more "cautiously." Conversely, some felt they had been "sidelined," resulting in low morale, lack of initiative in work, and even thoughts of "just waiting to be streamlined."

The comrades from the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team analyzed these active thoughts and believed they reflected a lack of correct understanding among these comrades regarding Chairman Mao's teachings on "We communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution." This is the focal point of the struggle between "public" and "private" among cadres. They decided, in conjunction with the commune's Revolutionary Committee, that cadres from the commune's office should go to the masses, and together with poor and lower-middle peasants, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to temper a heart loyal to serving the people on the frontline of class struggle.

The cadres from the commune's office arrived at Qijiada Village. Old poor peasant member Wang Chengzhang first shared his family's experience of using the brilliant "Three Articles" as a weapon to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and "farming for the revolution." The director of the village's Poor Peasants' Association, Luan Wenkai, shared his experience of remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "wholeheartedly serving the people," and how he had, for twenty years, diligently served the poor and lower-middle peasants in a deep mountain valley. The cadres participating in the study class were deeply moved and said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants love and are loyal to Chairman Mao without limit. Listening to the speeches of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we see our 'selfishness' most clearly, our souls are touched most deeply, and we need to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness most urgently." The cadres from the commune's office unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and sincerely serve the people.

The comrades from the Propaganda Team, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution," guided the cadres in a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, exposing and criticizing him, and inspiring everyone to spark a revolution in their souls. The more they studied and criticized, the more they felt the danger of the "official" mentality. They said, "'Official' is the 'sugar-coated bullet' of the Chinese Khrushchev, the butcher's knife. Once the 'official' mentality enters the mind, it leads to separation from the masses and from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ultimately standing against the people. Unless the 'official' mentality is eliminated, one cannot wholeheartedly serve the people." The cadres unanimously declared: They must thoroughly study and apply the "Three Articles," criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate his poisonous influence, and forever be servants of the people.

Comrade Shi Chuanshen, a member of the Commune Revolutionary Committee (formerly the deputy secretary and manager of the commune party committee), had some difficulty accepting the change in his position after the Revolutionary Committee was established. Through the study class, he said, "No matter how difficult it is, it is because of a lack of loyalty to Chairman Mao; no matter how difficult it is, it is all about the 'official' mentality. Once the 'official' mentality is overcome, any work can be done for the revolution." After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle were issued, he carried a backpack, traveled day and night, and went to the fifth production team of Jixiang Village, where class struggle is complex, to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every poor and lower-middle peasant household. He used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants to severely strike at the class enemies, promoting both revolution and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants were moved and said, "You work like this, and we are one hundred percent at ease. You are truly a new leadership, new thoughts, new style, and you are one heart with us poor and lower-middle peasants."

    永做人民的勤务员
    辽宁省辽阳县隆昌公社革命委员会成立后，由于工作的需要，对有些干部的工作，作了适当的调整。在这部分干部中产生了不同的活思想。调往重要工作岗位上的人，认为自己“当了官”，做事要“稳重”了；反之，有些人则认为自己是“靠边站了”，因而情绪不高，工作不主动，有的还存在“干脆等着精简”的思想。
    解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志分析了这些活思想，认为它反映了这部分同志对毛主席关于“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导缺乏正确的认识。这是机关干部“公”与“私”斗争的焦点。于是，他们同公社革委会研究决定：公社机关干部到群众中去，和贫下中农一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，在阶级斗争的第一线锤炼一颗为人民服务的忠心。
    公社机关干部来到祁家大队。老贫农社员王成章，首先介绍了他们一家七口人以光辉的“老三篇”为武器，斗私批修，“为革命种田”的体会。大队贫协主任栾文科，介绍了自己牢记毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，二十年如一日，身居深山沟，勤勤恳恳为贫下中农服务的动人事迹。参加学习班的干部们十分激动地说：“贫下中农对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚。听了贫下中农的发言，对自己‘私’字看得最清楚，触及灵魂最深刻，破私立公最迫切。”公社机关干部纷纷表示，要以贫下中农为榜样，老老实实为人民服务。
    宣传队的同志还遵照毛主席关于“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”的教导，引导干部对中国赫鲁晓夫进行了大揭发、大批判，并启发大家在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命。大家越学习、越批判，越觉得“官”字可怕。他们说：“‘官’字是中国赫鲁晓夫的‘糖弹’，是杀人的屠刀。头脑里有了‘官’字，就要离开群众，离开毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最后必然站在群众的对立面。‘官’气不破除，就不能全心全意为人民。”干部们一致表示：一定要狠学狠用“老三篇”，批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清其流毒，永当人民的勤务员。
    公社革委会委员石传文同志（原公社党委副书记兼社长），在革委会成立后，对职务变动有点想不通，通过学习班学习，他说：“千不通万不通，就是对毛主席不忠；千不通万不通，无非在一个‘官’字上打转转，斗掉了‘官’字，做什么工作都能为革命作出贡献。”毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示发出后，他背着背包，昼夜兼程，来到阶级斗争复杂的吉祥大队第五生产队，把毛主席的最新指示逐户传达给贫下中农。他以毛泽东思想为武器，发动贫下中农，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人，促进了革命和生产。贫下中农感动地说：“你们这样干，咱们一百个放心。你们真是新班子、新思想、新作风，和咱贫下中农一条心。”
