	Oppose Racial Discrimination, Oppose the Vietnam War, Oppose Political Persecution
	The Progressive Student Movement in the U.S. Makes Waves
	Student Struggles Gain Sympathy and Support from the American People, Making the Ruling Class Tremble

	BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON — Broad masses of students in the United States, undaunted by the frenzied suppression of the U.S. reactionary ruling authorities, continue to wage struggles against racial discrimination, the Vietnam War, and persecution in many universities. The brave struggles of progressive students in the United States have won the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the American people, while the U.S. reactionary ruling clique is trembling with fear.

	Hundreds of students at Columbia University in New York City, to protest the school administration's persecution of student leaders, once again occupied a school building on the evening of May 21. The students' struggle against racial discrimination, the Vietnam War, and for democratic rights at this university, which began on April 23, has lasted nearly a month and has twice occupied six school buildings. Black and white students at this school have united closely in the struggle and have also united with black masses outside the school in a common struggle. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique particularly hates the progressive student movement at Columbia University. They have dispatched more than a thousand police to brutally suppress the students at Columbia University and have arrested nearly a thousand students. Recently, the school authorities have summoned four student leaders, attempting to further suppress the progressive student movement. However, the unyielding students have once again launched a struggle against the reactionary ruling authorities and occupied a school building for the third time.

	The struggle of Columbia University students against persecution has won wide social sympathy and support. Some students' parents and lawyers who uphold justice also participated in the revolutionary action of occupying the school building on May 21. Many students at Columbia University have organized rescue teams to support their fellow students occupying the building. Some students have taken the iron covers of garbage cans as shields, guarding the steps in front of the school building, ready to resist police attacks on the building at any time. The struggle at this school is continuing to develop.

	Recently, a struggle against the Vietnam War and for democratic rights has also erupted at Princeton University in the United States. More than a thousand students at this school held a powerful demonstration in front of the administrative building, demanding that Princeton University sever its ties with the "Institute for Defense Analyses" and no longer serve U.S. aggression and war policies.

	A group of white and black students at Brooklyn College in New York City, to protest the school's policy of racial discrimination, demanding that the school enroll more black and Puerto Rican students, occupied the registration office of this college in the morning of May 20, using the filing cabinets in this office to block the door, forcing the school's night classes to stop. On May 21, the U.S. reactionary ruling authorities sent a large number of police to break down the door and arrest forty students. However, the reactionaries' suppression cannot extinguish the flames of student struggle, and a larger-scale struggle is brewing.

	On May 20, more than 1,500 students at Ohio State University in Ohio held a powerful demonstration in front of the school president's residence, frightening the governor of Ohio, who immediately ordered 650 National Guardsmen to be on alert, ready to suppress the students at any time.

	The Johnson administration, beset by troubles at home and abroad, is in an even more embarrassing and difficult situation under the new impact of the progressive student movement in the United States. On May 21, Johnson, in a secret speech to the heads of the American Bar Association, exclaimed that the United States is facing a "serious challenge" from within the country and is "going through a very dangerous period."

    反对种族歧视　反对侵越战争　反对政治迫害
    美国进步学生运动破浪前进
    学生斗争得到美国人民同情和支持，使统治集团惊恐万分
    新华社二十二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国广大学生群众不怕美国反动统治当局对他们的疯狂镇压，继续在美国许多大学中掀起反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争和反迫害的斗争。美国进步学生的英勇斗争获得了美国广大人民群众的同情和支持，而美国反动统治集团则惊恐万分。
    纽约市哥伦比亚大学的数百名学生，为了抗议校方对学生领袖的迫害，在二十一日晚又一次占领了学校的一个大楼。这所大学的学生反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争、要求民主权利的斗争，从四月二十三日爆发以来，已经坚持了将近一个月，并曾在四月底和五月中前后两次占领了学校的六座建筑物。这所学校的黑人学生和白人学生在斗争中紧密团结一致，并且和校外黑人区的黑人群众团结一致，共同斗争。美国反动统治集团对哥伦比亚大学的进步学生运动特别仇恨，它们曾出动千余名警察，对哥伦比亚大学的学生进行残酷的镇压，曾先后逮捕了近一千名学生。最近学校当局又传询四名学生领袖，妄图进一步压制进步学生运动。但是英勇不屈的学生，再次发动了对反动统治当局的斗争，第三次占领了这所学校的大楼。
    哥伦比亚大学学生反迫害的斗争，得到了广泛的社会同情和支持，一些学生的家长和主持正义的律师也参加了二十一日占领学校大楼的革命行动。哥伦比亚大学的许多学生还组织起救护队支持占领大楼的同学。还有一些学生拿起垃圾桶的铁盖子当作盾牌，守卫在学校大楼门前的台阶上，准备随时抵抗警察对大楼的攻击。目前，这所学校的斗争正在进一步发展中。
    最近，在美国另一所大学普林斯顿大学也爆发了反对侵越战争和要求民主权利的斗争。这所学校的一千余名学生在学校行政大楼前举行强大的示威，要求普林斯顿大学断绝和“国防分析研究所”的关系，不再为美国的侵略和战争政策服务。
    纽约市布鲁克林学院的一批白人学生和黑人学生，为抗议这所学校的种族歧视政策，要求学校招收更多的黑人学生和波多黎各学生，在二十日晨占领了这所学院的注册办公室，用这个办公室中的档案柜堵塞了大门，迫使学校的夜校停止了上课。二十一日，美国反动统治当局竟然派出大批警察，破门而入，逮捕了四十名学生。但是反动派的镇压并不能扑灭学生斗争的怒火，更大规模的斗争正在酝酿中。
    二十日，俄亥俄州俄亥俄大学的一千五百余名学生，在这所学校校长的住宅前举行强大的示威，吓得俄亥俄州州长立即下令六百五十名国民警卫队处于警戒状态，以便随时出动镇压学生。
    内外交困的美国约翰逊政府，在美国进步学生运动的新的冲击下，处境更加狼狈不堪，日子更加难过。约翰逊二十一日在对美国律师协会头头们发表的秘密讲话中惊呼，美国今天面临着来自国内的“严重的挑战”，“正经历着充满危险的非常时期”。
