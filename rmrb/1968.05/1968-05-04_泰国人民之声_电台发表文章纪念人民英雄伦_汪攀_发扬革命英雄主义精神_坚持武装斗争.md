	“Voice of the Thai People” Radio Station published an article on April 24 commemorating the sixth anniversary of the heroic martyrdom of Thai people’s hero Run Wannapa. The article calls on the Thai people to inherit and carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroes, persist in armed struggle, and strive for the thorough liberation of the Thai people.

	The article states that Run Wannapa was brutally murdered by the Thai reactionaries on April 24, 1962. In prison, he remained steadfast and unyielding; in the face of the enemy’s cruelty, he was brave and strong, fearing nothing; on the execution ground, in his last moments, he continued to propagate revolutionary truths, displaying a great revolutionary heroism. The article says that Run Wannapa will forever live in the hearts of the Thai people. He dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause of the Thai people and died for the people. His death is heavier than Mount Tai. Run Wannapa is truly an outstanding member of the Thai Communist Party and a good son of the Thai people.

	The article says that the Thai Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, educates its members and the Thai revolutionary people to establish a mindset of completely and thoroughly serving the people, putting the people’s interests first. Therefore, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, many revolutionary heroes have emerged in the revolutionary ranks. The article says that the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party is thriving and rapidly growing, dealing a heavy blow to the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique. The article emphasizes that the doom of the Thai reactionaries is already sealed. As long as the Thai people persist in unity and struggle, fear no difficulties, fear no sacrifices, and resolutely advance along the path of revolutionary armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party, and carry the revolution through to the end, final victory will definitely belong to the Thai people.

    文章说，伦·汪攀在一九六二年四月二十四日被泰国反动派野蛮杀害。在狱中，他坚贞不屈；在残暴的敌人面前，他勇敢坚强，无所畏惧；在刑场上，在生命的最后一刻，他仍坚持宣传革命真理，表现了大无畏的革命英雄气概。文章说，伦·汪攀将永远活在泰国人民心中。他把一生献给了泰国人民的革命事业，他为人民而死，他的死比泰山还重。伦·汪攀不愧是泰国共产党的优秀党员，不愧是泰国人民的好儿子。
    文章说，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的泰国共产党，教育她的党员和泰国革命人民要树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，把人民的利益放在第一位。因此，在泰共领导下的革命队伍中涌现了许许多多革命英雄。文章说，泰国共产党领导下的革命武装斗争正在蓬勃发展，迅速壮大，这给他侬—巴博卖国集团以沉重的打击。文章强调指出，泰国反动派的灭亡命运已经注定，只要泰国人民坚持团结战斗，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，坚决沿着泰国共产党领导的革命武装斗争道路前进，把革命进行到底，最后胜利一定属于泰国人民。
