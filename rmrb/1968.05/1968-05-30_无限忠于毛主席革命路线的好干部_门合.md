In the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought, in the storm of class struggle, another great communist warrior has emerged—Comrade Menhe.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao have recently personally approved an order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, posthumously awarding Comrade Menhe the glorious title of "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line," setting a shining example for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation.

Since joining the revolution, Comrade Menhe has been steadfast for twenty years, consistently loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Before his glorious sacrifice, he was the deputy political instructor of the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of the Qinghai Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. He was a vanguard warrior in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leading revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies, a shining example of a Party cadre continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great hero who fought for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line all his life.

He is infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, possessing the lofty virtues of a proletarian revolutionary warrior.

In the fierce struggle between the two lines during the socialist revolution, he always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, engaging in fearless and unyielding struggles against the revisionist traitors Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing.

He eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, striving to change his worldview, and turning the great Mao Zedong Thought into his soul.

He consistently maintained close ties with the masses, loving the people infinitely, and bravely risking his life to save others on multiple occasions, fully demonstrating the noble spirit of communism.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly supporting the revolutionary leftists, and bravely sacrificing himself to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and protect comrades in the proletarian revolutionary cause.

For the sake of great sacrifices, daring to change the heavens and the earth.

Comrade Menhe, with his glorious life, fulfilled his oath:

All thoughts for Chairman Mao,
All actions for Chairman Mao,
All steps following Chairman Mao,
All efforts for Chairman Mao.

Loyal to the people, loyal to the Party,
Sacrificing for the revolution.

In the autumn of 1967, the sun shone brightly over the Qinghai Plateau, and the songs of victory echoed. Under the radiant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee was born in the storm of class struggle! The situation was excellent.

Comrade Menhe, who was executing the support-leftist mission in the Baqiang Farm of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, together with the broad masses of revolutionary leftists, resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the newly born Revolutionary Committee. He organized the revolutionary leftists and masses to engage in vigorous revolutionary criticism in the fields and tents against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Qinghai. At the same time, he responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," ensuring a good harvest and aiming for a double victory in revolution and production, dealing a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and letting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line shine even brighter.

The weather on the plateau changes rapidly, and hail can strike at any moment. Comrade Menhe spent days with the revolutionary masses, with a spirit of defying nature, actively experimenting with homemade rockets to drive away clouds and prevent hail, ready to repel the unpredictable attacks of nature and protect production.

On the morning of September 5, the sky suddenly changed, and a fine rain fell. After studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" during the "Daily Reading" time, Comrade Menhe went with the revolutionary masses to the site of the homemade rocket installation. He recited, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Chairman Mao's teachings powerfully inspired his resolve to fight against nature. Comrade Menhe, tempered by the fires of war, deeply understood that installing homemade rockets was a dangerous task. From the start, he took the tools from others and personally took on the most dangerous task of loading explosives. He said, "This is dangerous; I'll do it!"

One rocket after another was loaded. Just as everyone was focused on their work, the explosives suddenly exploded. The fearless and selfless hero, Comrade Menhe, faced the danger without hesitation and rushed towards the explosives.

The mountain shook, the earth trembled, and a pillar of smoke rose to the sky! Flames erupted beneath him, and a massive shockwave lifted him into the air...

Hero Menhe sacrificed himself to protect the twenty-seven class brothers present. With his selfless spirit, he composed a magnificent song of Mao Zedong Thought.

The people who participated in the installation of the homemade rockets, braving the thick, choking smoke, found Menhe. Menhe had stopped breathing.

The military officers, soldiers, and revolutionary masses guarding around the hero stood motionless, gazing at Menhe's face. How they wished Menhe could open his eyes again, to see the mountains and waters of Baqiang, to see his comrades-in-arms who had fought side by side, to see the harvest brought by the Cultural Revolution! Everyone felt from the depths of their hearts: Menhe has not died, Menhe will not die, Menhe will live forever in our hearts! They used the most beautiful words to praise him as the "Eagle of the Grasslands" and the "Pine of the Snow Mountains."

Hero Menhe sacrificed himself, but people will never forget Comrade Menhe's repeated heroic deeds of saving others. When he was a messenger, one dawn, he drove a motorcycle to deliver documents. At a sharp turn, he suddenly saw a worker on a bicycle. Seeing that the motorcycle was about to hit the bicycle, Menhe, without regard for his own safety, suddenly threw the motorcycle to the right, injuring himself but saving the other person's safety. When he was a platoon leader, in a critical moment when a flood broke through the embankment, he used his body to block the breach, protecting the road, village, and fields. When he was a political instructor, during a grenade training, a soldier accidentally threw a grenade only five meters away from himself. In this critical moment, Menhe, without hesitation, leaped out of cover and threw himself on the soldier, protecting his class brother.

In the Cultural Revolution, the "August 18th" warriors who fought side by side with Menhe will never forget that in those days of rolling clouds, he brought the brilliant thoughts of the great leader Mao Zedong to the Baqiang Grassland, and together with the revolutionary masses, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and moved from victory to victory.

The people of the grasslands looked up to Beijing, yearning for the red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong, and unanimously praised the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong that nurtured such heroes.

September 5th was such a glorious day. Twenty-three years ago on this day, Comrade Zhang Zedong completely and thoroughly dedicated himself to the people, sacrificing his precious life, setting a shining example of a communist warrior for us. Twenty-three years later, today, in the midst of the victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Menhe, who took Comrade Zhang Zedong as his example and grew up under the nurturing of the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," stands before us with his glorious image of infinite loyalty to the people, infinite loyalty to the Party, infinite loyalty to the great leader Mao Zedong, infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Firmly supporting the leftists, unshakable and unyielding

"The seas churn with anger, the continents tremble with thunder." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the force of a storm, directly attacks the headquarters of the bourgeoisie. The "January Revolution" storm swept across the Qinghai Plateau.

On the night of January 23, 1967, Comrade Menhe, who was assisting the Fifth Company, received a phone call from the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction of the farm, informing him that "August 18th" had seized power, and the class enemies were organizing a counterattack, urgently needing the support of the military. Menhe had just hung up the phone when the company headquarters notified him to send someone to pick up the urgent documents from Chairman Mao regarding the military's support-leftist instructions.

Menhe was extremely excited and stayed up all night. That night, Menhe was like a soldier waiting in the trench, ready to charge, waiting for the great leader Chairman Mao's orders.

From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Menhe eagerly studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and guidelines on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao's great teachings and the practice of the Party's line struggles since the founding of the nation greatly enhanced Menhe's awareness of line struggles. He told his comrades, "The fundamental issue of the Cultural Revolution is the issue of power. We must not let the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party take away the proletarian power. This is the top priority for whether China changes color, and the top priority for the world revolution!"

Menhe had fought in Baqiang for seven whole years. He had a deep affection for the people here, like fish in water. Through in-depth investigations and research, he had seen clearly that the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction in Baqiang was born in the great storms and waves, and they were good in every way, good in standing firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and good in criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Menhe said, "We must firmly support 'August 18th'!"

As soon as it was dawn, the cavalry messenger returned with the documents. The great leader Chairman Mao's battle cry to "support the leftist broad masses" gave Menhe boundless strength. He told the officers and soldiers of the Fifth Company, "Chairman Mao's instructions are the direction of the revolution. We must execute them resolutely and immediately!"

After Menhe conveyed Chairman Mao's great orders to the military, he strode proudly to the farm and voluntarily represented the military to congratulate the "August 18th" on their victory in seizing power. The capitalist-roaders in the farm and some bad leaders shouted at Menhe, "'August 18th' seizing power is not valid, we will seize power!" Menhe firmly refuted, "Power is seized by the proletarian revolutionary rebels, you want to seize power, you can't! We will definitely support the leftists, unshakable and unyielding!" The "August 18th" warriors tightly grasped Menhe's hand, excitedly saying, "Comrade Menhe, with the military of Chairman Mao supporting us, no matter how great the difficulties, we will not be intimidated. Even if we have to climb the knife mountain and descend the fire sea, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's path!"

More than twenty days later, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Party launched a fierce counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary faction, and the "August 18th" revolutionary faction was labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and subjected to brutal suppression. "Plum blossoms bloom in the snow," the more the storms and waves, the more it shows the unshakable determination of the proletarian warriors; the more the dark clouds roll, the more it shows the red-heartedness of the proletarian warriors. Menhe studied Chairman Mao's great teachings even more diligently. He firmly believed that "darkness will soon pass, dawn is just ahead," and everywhere advocated for the revolutionary stance of "August 18th." Some said, "'August 18th' is a gang of ghosts and snakes," Menhe said, "'August 18th' has always been correct in its direction!" Some said, "'August 18th' is counter-revolutionary," Menhe said, "'August 18th' listens to Chairman Mao the most!"

The red sun's rays dispersed the clouds, illuminating the Baqiang Grassland. The great leader Chairman Mao timely discovered the Qinghai problem, smashing the counter-revolutionary tide. Menhe's heart surged with emotion, his blood boiled, and he stood for a long time in front of Chairman Mao's statue, singing loudly "The Great Ship Sails on the Ocean Guided by the Helmsman." He raised his arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" He personally arranged the propaganda float and went deep into the farm at night to propagate, spreading Chairman Mao's great voice across the grassland. In front of the great leader Chairman Mao's statue, Menhe solemnly swore, "For the sake of the country not changing color, I will revolutionize for life, support the leftists for life!"

Standing on the grassland, thinking of Beijing, following Chairman Mao's instructions closely

"Study Chairman Mao's instructions diligently and earnestly,
Propagate Chairman Mao's instructions without stopping for a moment,
Execute Chairman Mao's instructions thoroughly and completely,
Defend Chairman Mao's instructions firmly and unyieldingly."

Comrade Menhe fully practiced this action guideline he set for himself in his support-leftist work.

On May 6, Comrade Menhe led a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to officially take on the support-leftist mission in Baqiang Farm. He told the comrades who were supporting leftists together, "No matter how many times you support, the greatest support is to arm the leftists with Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how important it is, the most important thing is to help the leftists implement Chairman Mao's instructions."

After Comrade Menhe arrived at the farm, the first thing he did was to help the revolutionary masses establish unshakable "Daily Reading" and "Experience Sharing" learning institutions. He personally organized the revolutionary masses to formulate learning plans and compile learning materials for the "Three Constantly Read Articles," guiding the masses to place the study of Chairman Mao's works and instructions in a position higher than everything else. Comrade Menhe noticed that during the "Daily Reading" in the Financial Supply Department, someone came in and out to pick up things, so he told the comrades in the Financial Supply Department, "If someone comes to do business, you can first let them join the Daily Reading, and then work after reading." The autumn harvest season was approaching, and the farm organized a field service team to deliver goods to the fields. Menhe repeatedly told them, "You must first bring Chairman Mao's works to the fields!"

Baqiang Farm is thousands of mountains and rivers away from Beijing, but Menhe's heart is closely tied to Chairman Mao. The grassland's transportation is inconvenient, and newspapers cannot be seen in time. Menhe would turn on the radio every night when it was quiet, carefully recording Chairman Mao's instructions and the battle cries issued by the proletarian headquarters, quickly propagating and resolutely executing them, following Chairman Mao closely without missing a step.

Not long after Menhe arrived at the farm, he discovered that there were signs of division within the "August 18th" organization, and some leading members wanted to pull out a group of people to form another organization, affecting the revolutionary criticism and interfering with the direction of the struggle. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued the instruction to "guide the small-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the revolutionary path of the proletariat." Menhe acted swiftly and resolutely implemented it. He and the "August 18th" warriors studied Chairman Mao's instructions together, using the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon to break down bourgeois factionalism and enhance proletarian party spirit. He mobilized everyone to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Never forget class struggle.' The Communist Party is about class struggle, and revolution is about class struggle. To carry the revolution to the end, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, unite against the enemy, and carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle." Under Comrade Menhe's help, "August 18th" avoided division, enhanced unity, and powerfully promoted revolutionary criticism. Later, he also personally helped the revolutionary masses' organization draft a plan to carry out revolutionary criticism, requiring everyone to concentrate their efforts and time to launch a fierce attack on the handful of biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly criticizing and exposing them.

Chairman Mao called on the proletarian revolutionary faction to achieve great unity, and to do meticulous ideological and political work for the deceived masses. Menhe immediately helped the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction to study earnestly and respond resolutely, striving to be a model for revolutionary unity. He mobilized everyone to actively do the work of the deceived masses, proposing, "Winning over one more deceived class brother to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line increases the strength to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Comrade Menhe helped the revolutionary masses' organization to carry out the "One Helps One" activity, with everyone doing ideological and political work. He himself was at the forefront, doing the work to the hearts of the deceived masses. One night, Menhe, carrying Chairman Mao's precious book, walked in the moonlight, braving the cold wind, and traveled more than ten miles to the home of a deceived comrade. Under the oil lamp, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings together: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable, we ask for fewer mistakes. Having made mistakes, we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." Menhe encouraged him, "Falling down, learn to walk; choking, learn to swim! Revive your revolutionary spirit, make a comeback, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution." The comrade was deeply moved and resolutely declared to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

Menhe thought of everything for Chairman Mao and followed Chairman Mao closely. Chairman Mao's instructions guided his thoughts and directed all his actions. If Chairman Mao's instructions were not implemented for a day, Menhe would not eat or sleep well, and his heart would not be at peace.

On August 28, Menhe returned from a meeting at the company to the farm, already in the middle of the night. He turned on the radio and heard Chairman Mao issue the great call for "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," and he could no longer fall asleep. Countless memories of supporting the army and loving the people surged to his mind. He thought, Chairman Mao led the revolutionary wars, relying on the people and the unity of the military and the people, achieved great victories. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an even more profound political revolution, even more in need of carrying out a "people's war" and strengthening the unity of the military and the people. A handful of class enemies tried to sow discord between the military and the people to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution, and we must not let their plots succeed. As soon as it was dawn, he called the deputy political instructor of the Fifth Company and discussed together to formulate the "Love the People Agreement," immediately organizing the military to carry out activities of loving the people. He also personally guided the Fifth Company's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to rehearse performances, deeply propagating Chairman Mao's great call to the masses, and quickly launching a wave of supporting the army and loving the people in the farm's stationed military and the masses. When the higher authorities issued the plan to carry out activities of supporting the army and loving the people, flying over mountains and rivers to Baqiang, Comrade Menhe had already bravely sacrificed himself. Menhe, with his blood and life, practiced Chairman Mao's great call for "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," writing a moving chapter of supporting the leftists and loving the people.

Comrade Menhe and the revolutionary masses, with the spirit of "seizing the day," followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with the fastest steps, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving a double victory in revolution and production in the farm. People, in the days of celebrating victory, were full of passion, singing thousands of songs and praising the great leader Chairman Mao, admiring the good cadre Menhe who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line: Standing on the grassland, thinking of Beijing, crossing mountains and rivers but not blocking the sound, the heart has only Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's instructions closely!

For Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand guard and fight well

Comrade Menhe had this shining language:

"Always stand guard, stand firm, and fight well for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

For eighteen years since the founding of the nation, Comrade Menhe always remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist," "We must never relax our vigilance." He always closely watched the trends of class struggle. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, he was as alert and unyielding as in wartime.

In 1957, the bourgeois rightists took advantage of our Party's rectification to launch a ferocious attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. Menhe could not contain his anger and immediately actively joined the battle. One day, he saw in the newspaper that the rightists were clamoring for "taking turns in ruling" with the Communist Party, and he was so angry that he clenched his teeth and immediately called all the soldiers in his platoon to assemble. He led the troops to the Tianjin Airport, where they were then on duty, facing the bunkers left behind by the retreating Kuomintang bandits, and used the blood and tears of his ancestors for three generations to angrily denounce the Kuomintang reactionaries' heinous crimes. He said firmly, "It is either the Communist Party ruling or the Kuomintang ruling, there is no such thing as taking turns ruling! Who dares to challenge the Communist Party for the world, let them see, do our guns allow it?"

In those days of rolling clouds, whenever newspapers were delivered, Menhe would eagerly flip through them, looking for the signals of counterattacks. One day, finally, it arrived. When Menhe saw the signal to counterattack in the People's Daily—the editorial "Why Is This So?"—he jumped up in excitement. Under the leadership of the Party branch, he actively organized the soldiers to hold meetings, write articles, and launch a fierce counterattack against the bourgeois rightists.

In 1961, Liu Shaoqi spread the black wind of "Three Selfs and One Package" in the countryside. At this time, Menhe was already the political instructor of the Fifth Company. One day, a soldier from Anhui returned from a home visit. According to his usual habit of finding active thoughts in soldiers returning from home visits, Menhe went to talk to this soldier. The soldier reported that the land in their hometown had been redistributed to each family, and his family had even received a donkey's leg. Menhe was shocked, and with his high political sensitivity, he immediately realized: a fierce struggle between the two roads in the countryside had seriously arisen. The army was not living in a vacuum; would this struggle only appear in Anhui? What impact would it have on the soldiers? A series of questions weighed heavily on Comrade Menhe's mind. After talking to the soldier from Anhui, he rushed to various duty points at night, conducting a thorough investigation.

Many things are urgent. Menhe returned from the duty points and immediately called a meeting of the officers, and based on the situation he had learned, decisively decided to carry out socialist education in the company to counter the black wind of "Three Selfs and One Package." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a debate on "Is the People's Commune good, or is individual farming good?" unfolded throughout the company. Menhe led the company's military meeting to recall bitterness, to denounce the evil of individual farming. He said, "The road of individual farming is a bloody road, a road of regression to a society where people eat each other. Now, someone is spreading this individual farming wind again, we must resolutely repel it! Chairman Mao teaches us: After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there is still a part of society that dreams of restoring the capitalist system. We must be vigilant!"

Menhe's words struck the hearts of the soldiers, and the soldiers recalled bitterness and sweetness, denounced "Three Selfs and One Package," and spoke highly of the People's Commune. Menhe, based on everyone's discussion, summarized the "Ten Advantages of the People's Commune" and the "Eight Harms of Individual Farming," and propagated them everywhere. He also proposed an initiative at the battalion party committee meeting to carry out the "One Letter to the Family" activity throughout the battalion, helping relatives to see clearly and resist "Three Selfs and One Package," defending the socialist collective economy. One red letter after another flew to every corner of the country.

It was also during these days that Menhe and the soldiers, carrying hundreds of copies of Chairman Mao's works and more than a thousand yuan donated by all the comrades in the company, carrying their red hearts of loving the socialist cause, crossed mountains and rivers, braved the wind and snow, visited the nearby People's Communes, bringing Chairman Mao's great call for "The People's Commune is good" and the People's Liberation Army's determination to support the People's Commune to the Tibetan comrades on the grassland.

The fierce class struggle made Menhe deeply understand Chairman Mao's great thesis on class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat: After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, is still a long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce struggle." Menhe remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and, with high revolutionary vigilance, was always ready to smash the attacks of the class enemies.

When feudal and capitalist old plays were rampant everywhere, once, he led the company to participate in a joint performance activity in a certain place. After the soldiers performed revolutionary art performances, the local capitalist-roaders instructed some people to perform plays about talented scholars and beautiful women. As soon as the drums beat and the actors came on stage, Menhe immediately led the company out of the venue. Someone asked him, "Why aren't you watching the play anymore?" He angrily said, "Why watch these poisonous plays! With this time, we should go back and watch the story of Lei Feng."

Comrade Menhe believed that against poisonous plays, one could not just not watch them; one had to take an active offensive attitude, using revolutionary modern plays to resist and eliminate them, turning the stage into a red battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, he became even more enthusiastic about organizing singing activities. He personally arranged performances and took the lead in performing on stage. He organized this matter as if it were a major battle, devoting a lot of energy to it.

The company's singing troupe had a soldier who was not enthusiastic about organizing singing activities, thinking that soldiers held guns and practiced "martial arts"; singing and dancing, jumping and leaping, were just to make everyone happy, and he felt it was not very meaningful. Menhe found him to talk, walking and asking:

"Did you go back to Xi'an to see a play last time?"

"Yeah! I saw the revolutionary modern plays 'The Red Lantern,' 'Shajiabang,' 'The Red Detachment of Women,' it was great!"

"Do you know who led the creation of these plays?"

"Who doesn't know, it's Comrade Jiang Qing."

Menhe pulled him to sit down on the grass, affectionately and seriously saying, "Comrade Jiang Qing is so concerned about drama, why? To implement and carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of art, to drive the emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women off the stage, not allowing the class enemies to carry out capitalist restoration! We are the ones who practice 'martial arts,' but we must not underestimate art! We must hold the gun, but we must also hold the pen!" Saying this, he took out "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" from his pocket and studied it with the soldier.

Comrade Menhe was like this, listening to every word of Chairman Mao, following every step of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and wherever the enemy attacked Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he would resolutely and actively launch a counterattack.

"Chairman Mao's principles of military building, no one can change!"

"'Dare to be beheaded, dare to pull the emperor off the throne,' when we fight for socialism and communism, we must have this fearless spirit."

Menhe, this hero who is loyal to the people, loyal to the Party, and loyal to Chairman Mao, in the fierce struggle between the two lines, with the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely resisted the counter-revolutionary revisionist traitors Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's implementation of the bourgeois military line, and was indeed a hard-boned defender of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In 1956, Menhe was a platoon leader in the company. He felt that the ambitious traitor Peng Dehuai's implementation of various kinds of foreign doctrines was very unpleasant and angrily said, "Which of these doctrines is in line with Chairman Mao's teachings! Implementing these foreign doctrines has thrown away all the glorious traditions of our people's army!" He remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "The army must blend with the people, making the army appear as the people's own army in the eyes of the people, and this army will be invincible in the world." He felt that implementing the rank system, wearing two hard plaques on the shoulders, unable to carry or lift, would distance him from the people. He often took off his jacket with the hard plaques, rolled up his sleeves, and worked with the soldiers to carry water, sweep the ground, dig toilets, work with the workers to build the new port of Tianjin, and work with the peasants to rush the harvest and planting. In the eyes of the people, he was always a good son of the working people.

Menhe firmly resisted the formalism of things like reciting "reporting words" when subordinates saw superiors. When the soldiers came in and out, sometimes they got the "reporting words" wrong, he never criticized them, but instead educated the soldiers, saying, "Those foreign doctrines, it's best to forget them completely; the glorious traditions of the people's army, we must remember them firmly!"

In the summer of 1957, at the company's cadre training class, Menhe used one fact after another to denounce the "foreign doctrines" that destroyed our army's principles and glorious traditions. He pointed out sharply, "Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from the traditions of the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, why do we have to learn these foreign doctrines!" His speech received the support of many comrades. Some people said that Menhe's words were wrong, and they wanted to hold a "criticism" meeting for him. However, no matter how big a hat was put on him, Menhe always said firmly, "Anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, I will firmly oppose!"

The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the Party's Lushan Conference, announcing the complete failure of the ambitious traitor Peng Dehuai's plot to seize the military and rebel against the Party. Our beloved Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao presided over the work of the Military Commission. The great resolution on "Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" led by Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, inheriting the glorious traditions of the Gutian Conference, proposed the "Four Firsts," clarified the direction of political work and army building, and issued the great call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought." This is a new milestone in the history of our army's building. After listening to the transmission, Menhe copied the "Resolution" word by word into his own notebook at night and studied it seriously. He deeply felt that this was the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. He was extremely excited and eagerly said to everyone, "How wise and great Chairman Mao is! Having such a wise and great leader as Chairman Mao is our greatest happiness!"

At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the great leader Chairman Mao warned the entire Party, "Never forget class struggle." Chairman Mao's wise teachings further enhanced Menhe's awareness of class struggle and line struggle, giving him an extremely powerful force to stand guard, stand firm, and fight well for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist traitor Luo Ruiqing launched a wave of competitive military exercises, attempting to change the direction of our army's building and realize his wolf-like ambition to seize the military and rebel against the Party. At this critical moment, Menhe repeatedly studied "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," seriously understood Chairman Mao's wise teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and reviewed the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army." His mind became even clearer: how could one want military affairs without proletarian politics? This was the same as Peng Dehuai's, all opposing Chairman Mao's principles of military building. "Erroneous leadership that harms the revolution should not be accepted unconditionally, but should be firmly resisted." Menhe bravely stood up and clearly stated: opposing the impact on proletarian politics, opposing the selection of "elite troops," opposing the pursuit of championship! He said, "Only focusing on military affairs and not on proletarian politics is completely inconsistent with Mao Zedong Thought!" Some comrades advised him, "Old Menhe, you can't be so stubborn! If you insist, you will make mistakes!" Menhe said firmly, "Anything that is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, I will resist! If you want to select 'elite troops,' emphasize military affairs, and squeeze out proletarian politics, you might as well remove me! I will insist on the 'Four Firsts' for as long as I am a political instructor!"

After the Third Platoon was designated as the "elite platoon," Menhe went to give the first lesson. He did not talk about military affairs or technology, but studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with everyone. He said, "Training is mainly to cultivate the spirit of serving the people and the style of serving the people." He often went deep into the platoon, telling the soldiers stories of heroic warriors, saying, "In the past war years, so many heroes emerged, which one was made by climbing poles? Which one was made by climbing roofs? Did Dong Cunrui practice carrying explosive packages? Did Huang Jiguang practice blocking gun holes? But when the people needed them, they did such earth-shaking deeds. We must never forget Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's wise instructions, the greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

Before the "elite platoon" went to compete, Menhe asked everyone what they thought, and some said, "We must definitely win first place!" Menhe heard this, took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his pocket, and read aloud to everyone, "The foundation of the army is in the soldiers. Without progressive political spirit infused into the army, without progressive political work to carry out this infusion, true unity between officers and soldiers cannot be achieved, and the maximum anti-war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers cannot be aroused. All technology and tactics cannot be fully effective on this basis." With deep class feelings, he repeatedly told the soldiers about Chairman Mao's principles of military building, reminding them over and over again, "We must strive for political and ideological first place, absolutely not military and technical first place! This point, we must never forget!" At a meeting of the officers, someone proposed to cut political education and emphasize military training for the "elite platoon." Menhe insisted on "three not concessions": the time for studying Chairman Mao's works could not be conceded, the normal time for political education could not be conceded, and the time for reading newspapers could not be conceded. Due to his correct stance, the company he was in, the daily reading, political classes, and ideological and political work were always unshakable. He said firmly, "Chairman Mao's principles of military building, no one can change!"

In early 1965, at the expanded meeting of the company party committee, after listening to the transmission of Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, Menhe was extremely excited. He said over and over again, "Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao sees far, Mao Zedong Thought is held highest, every word and sentence hit our hearts." Returning to the company, he immediately convened an expanded meeting of the party branch to implement Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's instructions. At the meeting, he repeatedly emphasized, "Emphasizing proletarian politics is proposed by Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao based on Chairman Mao's thoughts on military building, it is the fundamental of our army's revolutionary construction. Grasping this fundamental, our army will be invincible and march forward bravely." The entire company quickly launched a wave of implementing and executing Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's instructions. Menhe also made a red flag with the soldiers, on which was written "Highly raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely," and let it fly high in the company!

In the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's principles of military building, in the practice of implementing Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, Menhe summarized ten requirements for building the company: making the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works thick, raising proletarian awareness high, tempering the spirit of serving the people red, digging out private thoughts clean, cultivating hatred for class enemies deep, cultivating the three-eight work style hard, inspiring revolutionary enthusiasm full, maintaining a correct attitude towards service, strengthening unity, and doing revolutionary work solidly. It was precisely because Menhe insisted on Chairman Mao's political principles of military building and strongly resisted the bourgeois military line of the counter-revolutionary revisionist traitor Luo Ruiqing that the company he led marched forward along Chairman Mao's principles of military building!

Never forget the bitterness of class struggle, infinitely love Chairman Mao

"The sky is big, the earth is big, but nothing is bigger than Chairman Mao's kindness; father and mother are dear, but nothing is dearer than Chairman Mao! Without Chairman Mao, there would be no me, Menhe; without Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation of the working people all over the world!" Menhe's love for Chairman Mao was higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas.

Menhe was raised eating bitter herbs. In the winter of 1928, in the mountainous area of Luanxian County, Hebei Province, the howling northwest wind mixed with yellow sand, making the sky dark and the earth dim. Menhe was born and immediately tasted the cold and hunger of the old society. His mother was too hungry to produce a drop of milk, so she left him, braved the wind and snow to beg for food. Menhe grew up eating bitter herbs until he was eight years old, following his father to be a beast of burden for the landlord. In 1940, the year of floods and no harvest, the heartless landlord kicked them out the door with a foot. In those days of hunger and cold, his parents reluctantly sold his younger brother and sister. The family parted, and all they got in exchange was four measures of corn and four measures of sorghum. The twelve-year-old Menhe cried until his eyes were swollen, following his parents to beg for food.

Menhe's family begged for food to Huanhua. His father went to work in a mine controlled by the Japanese devils, under the leadership of the Party personally created by Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Menhe's father actively participated in revolutionary work and fought against class enemies. The young Menhe began to understand that the great savior of the suffering people was Chairman Mao, and the great leader who led the poor to rebel was Chairman Mao. From then on, he followed Chairman Mao to make the revolution. He often went barefoot, wearing a sackcloth, taking risks, bravely delivering messages and intelligence for the Party. In 1946, Menhe's family returned to the liberated Luanxian. The following year, the nineteen-year-old Menhe joined the Communist Party of China in the magnificent land reform movement. In 1948, he joined the People's Liberation Army.

For more than twenty years, Menhe, with an extremely deep proletarian sentiment, infinitely loved Chairman Mao. Whenever he went to a place, the first thing he did was to hang a portrait of Chairman Mao. On the first page of each of his diaries and notebooks, he pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao. When his children just learned to speak, he did not teach them "father" or "mother," but taught them the first sentence, "Long live Chairman Mao!" When his younger sister wore new cotton clothes, he repeatedly instructed, "Never forget Chairman Mao after liberation." Whenever new soldiers came to the company, the first lesson he gave was "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and the first requirement he proposed was to "be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

The great ship sails on the ocean guided by the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Menhe took studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as his first need in life. He often said, "Whether to study Chairman Mao's works or not is a matter of revolutionary stance, revolutionary will, and revolutionary direction." He could go without food, without sleep, but he could not go without studying Chairman Mao's works. At night, when the soldiers had already fallen asleep, Menhe's tent was often lit. He studied Chairman Mao's works under a small kerosene lamp, tirelessly. Even in the dead of night when the temperature dropped to minus thirty degrees, he still insisted on studying. Whether it was the snowy winter or the scorching summer, whether it was in the fighting company or on a business trip far from the company, he eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works. Low culture, no problem; busy work, no problem. He said, "Chairman Mao's works must be studied every day. If you don't study for one day, there will be problems; if you don't study for two days, you will go downhill; if you don't study for three days, you won't be able to live."

"Chairman Mao's works, study a little, use a little, study without use, it's like plowing without sowing." Menhe always used Mao Zedong Thought to transform himself. He remembered Chairman Mao's teachings about "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," consciously breaking private thoughts and transforming his worldview. He often said, "A revolutionary can only grow in revolutionary struggle, only 'self-consciously red,' no 'naturally red.'" He actively attacked "self," and as soon as "self" appeared in his mind, he launched a annihilation battle. Comrades said that Menhe was a person who could not tolerate even a bit of private thoughts.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was both a revolutionary force, firmly supporting the broad masses of the leftists, and a revolutionary target, fiercely fighting against the "self" in his mind and transforming his worldview. He said, "Only by breaking down private thoughts can one firmly act according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; only by breaking down private thoughts can one love the leftists and more firmly support the leftists; only by breaking down private thoughts can one overcome bourgeois factionalism and enhance proletarian party spirit."

The hero loved Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtured the hero. Hero Menhe shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. In the years of war and fire, he fought bravely, and in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, he was not afraid of hardships and worked actively, winning the glorious title of "Five Good Cadres." His eyes were the brightest, his heart was the reddest, and his class hatred was the clearest. He remembered the bitterness of class struggle, never forgot the blood debt, and never forgot the class brothers suffering all over the world. On his holster, which he never left, he wrote down his lifelong wish:

Follow Chairman Mao, always make the revolution;
Follow Chairman Mao, the world will be red.

Comrade Menhe participated in the revolution for twenty years. Whether as a soldier or a cadre, he consistently loved the masses, was infinitely loyal to the people, and bravely risked his life to save others on multiple occasions, demonstrating the noble spirit of communism, and doing what Chairman Mao taught: "Always be ready to sacrifice your life for our cause." This is a photo of Comrade Menhe (right) when he was a messenger.

    无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部——门合
    在毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，出现了又一个伟大的共产主义战士——门合同志。
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席最近亲自批准，由中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，为全党、全军、全国人民树立了一个光辉榜样。
    门合同志参加革命以来，二十年如一日，一贯忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。他光荣牺牲前，是人民解放军青海省军区某部四团二营的副教导员，是无产阶级文化大革命中带领革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的先锋战士，是无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的党的干部的光辉榜样，是为捍卫毛主席革命路线奋斗终生的伟大英雄。
    他，无限忠于人民、无限忠于党、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，具有无产阶级革命战士的崇高品德。
    他，在社会主义革命时期两条路线的激烈搏斗中，始终坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿进行了英勇无畏的斗争。
    他，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，努力改造世界观，把伟大的毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。
    他，一贯密切联系群众，无限热爱群众，多次临危不惧，舍己救人，充分表现了高尚的共产主义精神。
    他，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决支持革命左派，为落实毛主席的指示，保护无产阶级革命派战友而英勇献身。
    为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。
    门合同志以他光辉的一生，实践了自己的誓言：
    一切想着毛主席，
    一切服从毛主席，
    一切紧跟毛主席，
    一切为着毛主席。
      忠于人民忠于党
    为革命英勇献身
    一九六七年秋天，青海高原阳光灿烂，凯歌阵阵。在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，青海省革命委员会在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中诞生了！形势一片大好。
    在海南藏族自治州贵南县巴仓农场执行支左任务的门合同志，和广大无产阶级革命派一起，坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫新生的革命委员会。他组织无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在田头、帐篷，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人，开展轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。同时，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，搞好秋收，决心夺取革命、生产双丰收，给党内一小撮走资派以沉重的打击，让毛主席的无产阶级革命路线放射出更灿烂的光辉。
    高原的天气瞬息万变，冰雹的袭击随时可来。门合同志连日和革命群众一起，以与天奋斗的豪迈气概，积极试制驱云防雹的土火箭，随时准备击退变化无常的大自然的袭击，保护生产。
    九月五日清晨，天色突变，细雨蒙蒙。门合在天天读的时间中，学习了“老三篇”以后，同革命群众一起，奔向土火箭装置场地。他边走边背诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的教导，有力地激励着他战天斗地的决心。经过战争年代炮火熏陶的门合，深深懂得装置土火箭是一项危险的工作，一开始，他就从别人手里抢来工具，亲自担任最危险的装填炸药工作。他说：“这危险，我来干！”
    土火箭装了一支又一支。正当大家聚精会神工作的时候，炸药发生意外的爆炸。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的无私无畏的英雄门合，临危不惧，向炸药猛扑上去。
    山摇地动，烟柱冲天！烈火在他身下迸发，巨大的气浪把他腾空掀起……
    英雄门合，用自己的生命保护了在场的二十七名阶级兄弟。他以舍己为人的伟大共产主义精神，谱写了一曲毛泽东思想的壮丽凯歌。
    参加装置土火箭的人们，冒着浓烈呛人的烟火，找到门合以后，门合已经停止了呼吸。
    守护在英雄周围的部队干部、战士和革命群众，一动也不动地望着门合的脸。人们多么希望门合同志能睁开眼睛，再看一看巴仓的山，巴仓的水，看一看并肩战斗过的战友，看一看文化大革命带来的丰收景象啊！大家从内心深处觉着：门合没有死，门合不会死，门合永远活在人们的心里！人们用最美好的语言，赞美他是“草原上的雄鹰”，是“雪山上的青松”。
    英雄门合牺牲了，但是人们永远不会忘记门合同志屡次舍身救人的英雄行为。他当通信员的时候，一天拂晓，驾驶摩托车去送文件，在急转弯时，突然发现一个骑自行车的工人，眼看摩托车就要撞到自行车，门合不顾个人安危，猛然把摩托车向右摔倒，自己负伤流血，保护了对方的安全。他当排长的时候，在洪水冲破渠岸的紧急关头，用身子堵住决口，保护了公路、村庄和田园。他当指导员的时候，一次投弹训练，有个战士不慎把手榴弹投到离自己身前只有五米远的地方，在这危急时刻，门合奋不顾身，跃出掩体扑在这个战士身上，保护了阶级兄弟。
    在文化大革命中与门合并肩战斗的“八·一八”战士，也永远不会忘记，在那乌云翻滚的日子里，他把伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想，带到了巴仓草原，和革命群众一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，从胜利走向胜利。
    草原的人们仰望着北京，思念着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，齐声颂扬毛主席的光辉思想哺育了这样的英雄。
    九月五日，是一个多么光辉的日子。二十三年前的这天，张思德同志完全彻底为人民，献出了自己的宝贵生命，为我们树立了一个共产主义战士的光辉榜样。二十三年后的今天，在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，门合，这个以张思德同志为榜样，在毛主席“老三篇”的光辉思想哺育下成长的共产主义战士，以他那无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的光辉形象，屹立在我们的面前。
    坚定不移支持左派  雷打不动风吹不摇
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”无产阶级文化大革命以排山倒海之势，直捣资产阶级司令部。“一月革命”风暴，席卷了青海高原。
    一九六七年一月二十三日深夜，在五连帮助工作的门合同志接到农场“八·一八”无产阶级革命派的电话，告诉他“八·一八”已经夺了权，阶级敌人正组织反扑，迫切需要部队给予支援。门合刚撂下听筒，营部就通知他明天一清早派人去取毛主席关于部队支左指示的紧急文件。
    门合万分激动，彻夜不眠。这一夜，门合象守候在堑壕里准备冲锋的战士，等待着伟大领袖毛主席的命令。
    无产阶级文化大革命一开始，门合就如饥似渴地学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，学习毛主席《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作。毛主席的伟大教导，建国以来历次路线斗争的实践，大大增强了门合的路线斗争观念。他对同志们说：“文化大革命的根本问题，是政权问题。我们决不能让党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把无产阶级的印把子夺走，这是中国变不变颜色的头等大事，是世界革命的头等大事！”
    门合在巴仓整整战斗了七年，他对这里的人民群众有着鱼水般的深情。他经过深入的调查研究，已经看清楚巴仓农场“八·一八”是在大风大浪中诞生的无产阶级革命派，他们千好万好，就好在紧紧地站在毛主席革命路线一边，好在大造党内一小撮走资派的反。门合说：“我们要坚定不移地支持‘八·一八’！”
    天色刚破晓，骑兵通信员取回文件。伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，给门合增添了无穷的力量。他对五连的干部、战士说：“毛主席的指示，就是革命的方向，我们要坚决执行，立即照办！”
    门合给部队传达了毛主席伟大号令之后，昂首阔步去到农场，主动代表部队向“八·一八”夺权胜利表示祝贺。农场走资派和个别坏头头，冲着门合叫嚷：“‘八·一八’夺的权不算数，我们要夺权！”门合斩钉截铁地驳斥：“权是无产阶级革命造反派夺的，你们要夺权，办不到！”“我们支持左派是支持定了，雷打不动，风吹不摇！”“八·一八”战士紧握着门合的手，激动地说：“老门啊，有毛主席的军队给我们撑腰，天大的困难也吓不倒我们，那怕上刀山，下火海，毛主席的路我们走定了！”
    二十多天以后，青海省党内一小撮走资派向无产阶级革命派进行疯狂反扑，“八·一八”革命派被打成了“反革命”，遭到残酷的镇压。“梅花欢喜漫天雪”，越是险风恶浪，越显出无产阶级战士的无比坚定；越是黑云滚滚，越显出无产阶级战士的赤胆红心。门合更加勤奋地学习毛主席的伟大教导，他深信“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”，到处为“八·一八”的革命立场进行申辩。有人说“‘八·一八’是牛鬼蛇神”，门合说：“‘八·一八’的大方向始终正确！”有人说“‘八·一八’是反革命”，门合说：“‘八·一八’最听毛主席的话！”
    红太阳的光辉，驱散了乌云，照亮了巴仓草原。伟大领袖毛主席及时发现了青海问题，粉碎了反革命逆流。门合心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，久久站在毛主席的塑像前，放声歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。振臂欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他亲自动手布置宣传彩车，连夜深入农场，进行宣传，使毛主席的伟大声音，传遍草原。门合在伟大领袖毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“为了国家不变颜色，干一辈子革命，支持一辈子左派！”
    站在草原想北京  毛主席指示紧紧跟
    “学习毛主席指示，刻苦认真，
    宣传毛主席指示，分秒不停，
    执行毛主席指示，完全彻底，
    捍卫毛主席指示，坚定不移。”
    门合在支左工作中完全实践了他给自己规定的这个行动准则。
    五月六日，门合同志带领着一支毛泽东思想宣传队，正式到巴仓农场担负这里的支左工作。他跟一起支左的同志说：“千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装左派是最大的支援；千重要，万重要，帮助左派落实毛主席指示最重要。”
    门合同志到农场后，第一件事就是帮助革命群众建立雷打不动的“天天读”、“讲用会”等学习制度。他亲自给革命群众组织制定学习计划，编写学习“老三篇”的辅导材料，引导群众把学习毛主席著作和毛主席的指示摆在高于一切的位置。门合同志发现财供科在“天天读”的时候，有人来往领取东西，他就告诉财供科的同志说：“有人来办事，可以先让他一起参加天天读，读完了再工作。”秋收大忙季节快到了，农场组织了田间服务组，送货下田，门合再三对他们说：“你们首先要把毛主席著作带到田间！”
    巴仓农场离北京千山万水，门合的心却紧紧地和毛主席贴在一起。草原交通不便，不能及时看到报纸。门合每当夜深人静，都要拧开收音机，一字一句记下毛主席的指示，记下无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，迅速宣传，坚决执行，一步不离地紧跟毛主席。
    门合到农场不久，发现“八·一八”组织内部有分裂的苗头，个别领导成员想拉出一批人另成立组织，影响了革命大批判，干扰了斗争大方向。正在这个时候，毛主席发出“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的指示，门合闻风而动，坚决贯彻。他和“八·一八”战士共同学习毛主席的指示，以“老三篇”为武器，大破资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。他动员大家深入搞好革命的大批判。他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，共产党就是搞阶级斗争的，革命就是搞阶级斗争。要把革命进行到底，就要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，团结对敌，更深入地搞好革命大批判，紧紧掌握斗争大方向。”在门合同志的帮助下，“八·一八”避免了分裂，增强了团结，有力地促进了革命大批判。后来，他还亲自帮助革命群众组织拟制开展革命大批判的计划，要求大家集中力量，集中时间，向党内一小撮最大的走资派狠狠地开火，把他们彻底批倒批臭。
    毛主席号召无产阶级革命派要实现革命大联合，对受蒙蔽群众要进行细致的思想政治工作。门合立即帮助“八·一八”无产阶级革命派认真学习，坚决响应，争取做革命大联合的模范。他发动大家积极做好受蒙蔽群众的工作，提出：“多争取一个受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟回到毛主席革命路线上来，就多增加一分捍卫毛主席革命路线的力量。”门合同志帮助革命群众组织开展了“一帮一”活动，人人做思想政治工作。他自己更是走在前头，把工作做到受蒙蔽群众的心窝里。一天深夜，门合揣着毛主席的宝书，踏着月光，冒着寒风，跑了十多里路，来到一个受蒙蔽的同志家里。在油灯下，他们共同学习毛主席的教导：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”门合鼓励他说：“摔了筋斗要学会走路，呛了水要学会游泳啊！要振作革命精神，大杀回马枪，在文化大革命中立新功。”这个同志十分感动，坚决表示跟着毛主席革命到底。
    门合一切想着毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席。毛主席的指示，统帅着他的思想，指挥着他的一切行动。毛主席的指示，一天不落实，门合就一天吃饭不香，睡觉不甜，心里不安宁。
    八月二十八日，门合从营里开完会赶回农场，已经是深夜了。他打开收音机，听到了毛主席发出“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，就再也不能入睡了。许许多多民拥军、军爱民的往事，一齐涌向心头。他想，毛主席领导的历次革命战争，都是依靠人民群众，依靠军民团结，取得了伟大的胜利。无产阶级文化大革命是一场更加深刻的政治大革命，更加需要开展“人民战争”，加强军民团结。一小撮阶级敌人妄图挑拨军民关系，达到他们破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的，我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。第二天天一亮，他就把五连副指导员找来，共同商量制定了“爱民公约”，立即组织部队开展爱民活动。他又亲自指导五连的毛泽东思想宣传组赶排文艺节目，深入地向群众宣传毛主席的伟大号召，在农场驻军和群众中迅速掀起了一个拥军爱民的热潮。当上级开展拥军爱民活动的计划，飞山越水送到巴仓的时候，门合同志已经英勇地牺牲了。门合，用自己的鲜血和生命，实践了毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，写下了激动人心的支左爱民的新篇。
    门合同志和革命群众一起，以“只争朝夕”的精神，以最快的步伐，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决落实毛主席的指示，使农场的革命、生产获得了双丰收。人们在欢庆胜利的日子里，满怀激情，千歌万曲，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，赞扬无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志：站在草原想北京，隔山隔水不隔音，心中只有毛主席，毛主席的指示紧紧跟！
    为毛主席的革命路线  放好哨站好岗打好仗
    门合同志有这样一句闪闪发光的语言：
    “时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！”
    建国十八年来，门合同志牢记毛主席“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”，“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”的伟大教导，一直密切注视着阶级斗争的动向。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的搏斗中，他和战争年代一样，是一名有着高度警觉的、无比坚定的无产阶级战士。
    一九五七年，资产阶级右派利用我们党整风的机会，向无产阶级专政发起猖狂进攻。门合按不住胸中的怒火，立即积极地投入了战斗。一天，他从报纸上看到右派叫嚣要同共产党“轮流执政”，气得牙关紧咬，马上叫全排战士集合。他把队伍带到当时他们值勤的天津机场上，面对着国民党匪帮溃退时残留下来的碉堡，用自己祖辈三代的血泪史，愤怒控诉国民党反动派的滔天罪行。他坚定地说：“不是共产党执政，就是国民党执政，没有什么轮流执政！谁敢和共产党争天下，让他睁开眼看看，我们手里的枪杆子答应不答应！”
    在那乌云翻滚的日子里，每当送来了报纸，门合就急切地翻来复去寻找，看反击的文章登出来没有。这一天，终于来到了，当门合从《人民日报》上，看到发出了反击的信号——《这是为什么？》的社论，兴奋得跳了起来。在党支部领导下，他积极组织战士开会讨论，写稿子，向资产阶级右派展开猛烈的反击。
    一九六一年，中国赫鲁晓夫在农村大刮“三自一包”黑风，这时候，门合已经担任五连指导员。一天，一个安徽籍战士探亲回来，门合按照一向找探家战士抓活思想的习惯，去找这个战士谈心。战士反映，他们家乡土地又分到各家去种了，他家还分了一条驴腿，门合听了猛地一惊，凭着他高度的政治敏感，立刻意识到：一场农村两条道路的斗争，已经严重地摆到了面前。部队不是生活在真空里面，这场斗争是不是仅仅在安徽出现？对战士又会发生怎样的影响？一连串的问题，压在门合同志心上。在和这个安徽籍战士谈话之后，他连夜跑到各个值勤点上，普遍地进行摸底。
    多少事，从来急。门合从值勤点回来，立刻召开干部会，根据了解到的情况，果断地决定在连队进行社会主义教育，反击“三自一包”的黑风。在毛泽东思想指引下，一场“人民公社好，还是单干好”的辩论，在全连展开了。门合在全连军人大会上带头忆苦，带头控诉单干的罪恶。他说：“单干的道路是一条血淋淋的道路，是一条向人吃人的社会倒退的道路。现在，有人又刮起这股单干风，我们要坚决打退它！毛主席教导我们：在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度。我们可得提高警惕啊！”
    门合的话，点到了战士心坎上，战士们纷纷忆苦思甜，怒斥“三自一包”，大讲人民公社好。门合根据大家的讨论，总结了“人民公社十大优越性”和“单干八大害处”，到处宣传。又在营党委会上提出倡议，在全营展开“一封家信”的活动，帮助亲友擦亮眼睛，抵制“三自一包”，维护社会主义集体经济。一封封红色家信，飞向祖国的四面八方。
    也就在这些日子里，门合和战士们带着几百本毛主席著作和全连同志捐献的一千多元钱，带着热爱社会主义事业的颗颗红心，翻山越岭，顶风冒雪，走访附近的人民公社，把毛主席“人民公社好”的伟大号召，把人民解放军支持人民公社的决心，带给草原上的藏族同胞。
    激烈的阶级斗争，使门合深刻地领会了毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争的伟大学说：在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”门合牢记毛主席的教导，以高度的革命警惕，随时准备粉碎阶级敌人的进攻。
    在封建主义、资本主义旧戏到处泛滥的时候，一次，他带着连队去某地参加联欢活动。在战士们演出了革命文艺节目以后，当地走资派指使一些人演出才子佳人戏。锣鼓一敲响，角色一出台，门合立即把连队带出会场。有人问他：“为什么不看戏了？”他气愤地说：“看这些毒草戏干什么！有这个时间，我们回去看雷锋的故事。”
    门合同志认为，对毒草戏，不能光是不看它，要采取积极进攻的态度，用革命现代戏去抵制它，挤掉它，把舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的红色阵地。因此，他对开展演唱活动，比以前更加热心起来了。他亲自编排节目，带头登台演出。他象组织一场重大的战斗一样，拿出很大的精力来抓这件事情。
    连队演唱组有个战士，对开展演唱活动劲头不足，认为当兵拿的是枪杆子，练的是“武艺”；拉拉唱唱，蹦蹦跳跳，无非是叫大家乐一乐，觉得没有多大意思。门合找他去谈心，边走边问：
    “你上次回西安探家看戏没有？”
    “看啦！看了革命现代戏《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《红色娘子军》，真过瘾！”
    “你知道这些戏，是谁领导搞出来的吗？”
    “那谁不知道，是江青同志。”
    门合拉他在草滩上坐下来，亲切地严肃地对他说：“江青同志对戏剧这样重视，为什么？为了贯彻执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，为了把那些帝王将相、才子佳人赶下舞台，不许阶级敌人搞资本主义复辟！我们是搞‘武艺’的，可是，千万不能小看文艺啊！咱们要抓枪杆子，也要抓笔杆子！”说着，从兜里拿出《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，和这个战士一起学起来。
    门合同志就是这样，毛主席的话，句句听；毛主席的革命路线，步步跟；敌人在哪里向毛主席的革命路线进攻，他就在哪里主动地坚决地展开反击。
    “毛主席的建军原则，谁也不能变！”
    “‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”
    门合，这个忠于人民、忠于党、忠于毛主席的英雄战士，在两条路线的激烈搏斗中，以无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，坚决抵制了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线，不愧为捍卫毛主席革命路线的硬骨头。
    一九五六年，门合在连队当排长。他觉得篡军反党的大野心家彭德怀推行的那一套各式各样的洋教条，很不对味，非常气愤地说：“这一套，哪一点符合毛主席的教导！搞这些洋教条，把我们人民军队的光荣传统全丢了！”他牢记毛主席教导：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。他觉得实行军衔制，肩上挂着两块硬牌牌，挑不能挑，扛不能扛，就会和群众疏远。他经常脱掉挂着硬牌牌的上衣，挽起袖子，跟战士一起挑水、扫地、挖厕所，跟工人一起修建天津新港，跟农民一起抢收、抢种。在人民群众眼里，他始终是劳动人民的好儿子。
    门合对下级见上级要念“报告词”之类的形式主义的东西，坚决加以抵制。战士们进进出出，有时把“报告词”背错了，他从不批评，还教育战士说：“那些洋教条，最好忘得光光的；人民军队的光荣传统，可要记得牢牢的！”
    一九五七年夏天，在全团的干部轮训班上，门合用一桩桩一件件的事实，痛斥了破坏我军建军原则和光荣传统的“洋教条”。他一针见血地指出：“毛主席教导我们要学习红军、八路军的光荣传统，为什么硬要学那些洋教条！”他的发言，得到了许多同志的支持。也有人说，门合的话是错误言论，要开他的“批判”会。但是，不管多大帽子向他扣来，门合总是坚定地说：“凡是不符合毛主席教导的，我就要坚决反对！”
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的庐山会议，宣告了大野心家彭德怀篡军反党阴谋的彻底破产。我们敬爱的副统帅林副主席主持了军委工作。林副主席亲自领导制定的具有伟大历史意义的《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，继承了古田会议的光荣传统，提出了四个第一，阐明了政治工作和我军建设的方向，发出了“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的伟大号召。这是我军建军史上新的里程碑。门合在团里听了传达以后，连夜把“决议”一字一句地抄在自己的笔记本上，认真学习。他深深地体会到，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他无比地欢欣鼓舞，逢人就兴奋地说：“毛主席多么英明伟大！有毛主席这样英明伟大的领袖，就是我们最大的幸福！”
    在党的八届十中全会上，伟大领袖毛主席告诫全党“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。毛主席这一英明教导，更加提高了门合的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，给了他为毛主席革命路线放好哨、站好岗、打好仗的无比强大力量。
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿掀起了一股大比武的妖风，妄图改变我军建军方向，实现其篡军反党的狼子野心。在这一关键时刻，门合反复学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，认真领会毛主席政治是统帅，是灵魂的英明教导，重温《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》。他的心里更加豁亮了：怎么能只要军事不要无产阶级政治？这和彭德怀那一套一样，都是反对毛主席建军路线的。“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”门合勇敢地站了出来，明确表示：反对冲击无产阶级政治，反对拼凑“尖子”，反对搞锦标主义！他说：“光抓军事不抓无产阶级政治，根本不符合毛泽东思想！”有的同志劝他：“老门，可不能硬顶呀！这样顶下去要犯错误的！”门合坚定地说：“凡是不符合毛泽东思想的东西，我就要顶！要想拼凑‘尖子’，要突出军事，挤掉无产阶级政治，除非把我撤了！我当一天指导员，就要坚持一天四个第一！”
    三班定为“尖子班”以后，门合去上第一课，他没有讲军事，也没有讲技术，而是和大家一起学习《为人民服务》。他说：“练兵，主要是练为人民服务的思想，练为人民服务的作风。”他经常深入到班里，给战士们讲战斗英雄的故事，说：“过去战争年代里，出了那么多英雄，那一个是爬竿爬出来的？那一个是上房上出来的？董存瑞练过托炸药包吗？黄继光练过堵枪眼吗？但是当人民需要的时候，他们就做出了那样惊天动地的事业。我们千万不要忘记林副主席的英明指示，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。”
    “尖子班”出去比武前夕，门合问大家有什么想法，有的说：“一定争个第一名！”门合听了，随手掏出《毛主席语录》，一字一句给大家朗读：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”他怀着深厚的阶级感情，反复给战士们讲毛主席的建军原则，一再叮咛他们：“我们要争取政治思想第一，绝不是单纯的军事技术第一！这一点，可千万不要忘记啊！”在一次干部会上，有人提出“尖子班”要砍掉政治教育，突出军事训练。门合坚持“三不让”：学习毛主席著作的时间不能让，正常的政治教育时间不能让，读报的时间不能让。由于他的正确立场，他所在的连队，天天读、政治课和思想政治工作，始终雷打不动。他无比坚定地说：“毛主席的建军原则，谁也不能变！”
    一九六五年初，门合在团党委扩大会上，听了传达毛主席的亲密战友林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示以后，心情万分激动。他一遍又一遍地说：“林副主席站得高，看得远，毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，字字句句说到了咱们的心坎上。”回到连里，他马上召开党支部扩大会议，贯彻林副主席的指示。在会上，他反复强调：“突出无产阶级政治，是林副主席根据毛主席的建军思想提出来的，是我军革命化建设的根本。抓住这个根本，我们这个军队就战无不胜，勇往直前。”全连迅速掀起了一个贯彻执行林副主席指示的热潮。门合还和战士们一起做了一面红旗，上面写着“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进”，让它在连队高高飘扬！
    在捍卫毛主席建军路线的激烈斗争中，在贯彻林副主席突出无产阶级政治指示的实践中，门合总结了建设连队的十条要求：把学习毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的，把无产阶级觉悟提得高高的，把为人民服务的思想炼得红红的，把私心杂念挖得净净的，把对阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，把三八作风培养得硬硬的，把革命干劲鼓得足足的，把服役态度端得正正的，把团结搞得好好的，把革命工作搞得扎扎实实的。正是由于门合坚持了毛主席政治建军的原则，有力地抵制了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线，他所领导的连队，沿着毛主席的建军路线阔步前进！
    终生不忘阶级苦  无限热爱毛主席
    “天大地大，没有毛主席的恩情大；爹亲娘亲，没有毛主席亲！没有毛主席，就没有我门合；没有毛主席，就没有普天下劳动人民的解放！”门合对毛主席的热爱，比山还高，比海还深。
    门合是吃苦苦菜长大的苦孩子。一九二八年的冬天，河北省涞源县山区，呼啸的西北风夹着黄沙，刮得天昏地暗。门合一出生，就尝到了旧社会的寒冷和饥饿。娘饿得挤不出一滴奶，只好扔下他，顶风冒雪去讨饭。门合吃苦苦菜长到八岁，就跟着父亲给地主做牛马。一九四○年，天涝无收，黑心的地主一脚把他们父子踢出了门。在那饥寒交迫的年月里，爹娘忍痛卖了弟弟和妹妹。一家临别时，弟弟抱着娘不放，哭喊着：“娘啊！我不饿，我不离开家呀！”妹妹抓住门合的手，哭着说：“哥啊！我要跟你挖苦苦菜去！”朝夕相处的亲骨肉一去不见了，换来的只是四升玉米、四升高粱。十二岁的门合哭肿了眼，跟着爹娘去逃荒。
    门合一家逃荒到了宣化。他父亲到日本鬼子统治的矿上去做工，在毛主席亲手缔造的党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，门合同志的父亲积极参加革命工作，同阶级敌人进行斗争。小小的门合，开始懂得了受苦人的大救星是毛主席，领导穷人闹翻身的伟大领袖是毛主席。从那时起，他就跟着毛主席闹革命。他经常光着脚板，披着麻袋片，担着风险，勇敢地为党送信、送情报。一九四六年，门合一家回到解放了的涞源。第二年，十九岁的门合在轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动中，光荣地加入中国共产党。一九四八年，他又参加了中国人民解放军。
    二十多年来，门合怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，无限热爱毛主席。他每到一个地方，首先是挂毛主席像。他的每一个日记本、笔记本，第一页上都贴着毛主席的像。当他的孩子刚学话的时候，他不教“爹”，不教“娘”，教的第一句话是“毛主席万岁！”妹妹穿上了新棉衣，他千嘱咐万嘱咐，“翻身永远不忘毛主席”。每逢新战士来到连队，他上的第一课是《为人民服务》，提出的第一个要求是“做毛主席的好战士”。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。门合把活学活用毛主席著作当做生命的第一需要。他常说：“学不学毛主席著作，是革命立场问题，革命意志问题，革命方向问题。”他可以不吃饭，不睡觉，但不能不学毛主席著作。夜晚，战士们已经入睡，门合住的帐篷，却经常亮着灯光。他在一盏小小的煤油灯下，孜孜不倦地学习毛主席著作。甚至在气温下降到零下三十多度的深夜，他还坚持学习。不管是风雪弥漫的严冬，还是烈日炎炎的盛夏；不管是在战斗的连队，还是在远离连队的出差途中，他都如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。文化低，难不倒，工作忙，挤不掉。他说：“毛主席著作要天天学，一天不学问题多，两天不学走下坡，三天不学没法活。”
      “毛主席著作，要学一点，用一点，学了不用，等于耕地不播种。”门合时刻用毛泽东思想改造自己。他牢记毛主席关于“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，自觉地破私立公，改造世界观。他常说：“一个革命者只能在革命斗争中锻炼成长，只有‘自觉红’，没有‘自来红’。”他主动地向“私”字进攻，“私”字在头脑中一出现，就打歼灭战。同志们说，门合是一个容不得半点私心杂念的人。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，他既作革命的动力，坚定地支持左派广大群众，又当革命的对象，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，改造世界观。他说：“只有破除了私心，才能坚定不移地按照毛主席的革命路线办事；只有破除了私心，才能热爱左派，更坚定地支持左派；只有破除了私心，才能克服资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。”
    英雄热爱毛主席，毛泽东思想育英雄。英雄门合身上闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。在战火纷飞的岁月里，他英勇战斗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中，他不畏艰苦，积极工作，荣获过“五好干部”的光荣称号。他眼最亮，心最红，阶级爱憎最分明。他牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，不忘全世界受苦受难的阶级兄弟。他在自己一刻不离身的手枪套上，写下了终生的心愿：
    跟着毛主席，永远闹革命；
    跟着毛主席，世界一片红。
