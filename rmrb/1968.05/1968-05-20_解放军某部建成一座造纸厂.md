A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," has built a paper mill in Shanxi Province to produce paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. This mill is named the "May 7th Paper Mill" and began production on the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive."

The construction of this paper mill began in April of last year, with an annual production capacity of 1,800 tons of paper for printing Chairman Mao's works.

Driven by the revolutionary criticism movement, the soldiers and officers of the construction unit displayed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win, combining revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude to overcome various difficulties encountered during the construction process. According to conventional standards, this mill would have taken two to three years to complete, but they finished it in just eleven months.

     解放军某部建成一座造纸厂
    人民解放军某部在伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示的指引下，在山西省建成了一座生产印制毛主席著作用纸的工厂。这个工厂被命名为“五·七”造纸厂，已经在毛主席“五·七”指示发表两周年的时候正式投入生产。
    这个造纸厂是去年四月开始兴建的，年产一千八百吨印制毛主席著作用纸。
    在革命大批判的带动下，建厂部队指战员，发挥了巨大的积极性和创造性。他们遵照毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导，把革命精神和科学态度紧密结合起来，克服了建厂过程中遇到的各种困难。按照常规，这个工厂需要两三年才能建成，他们只用了十一个月就建成了。
