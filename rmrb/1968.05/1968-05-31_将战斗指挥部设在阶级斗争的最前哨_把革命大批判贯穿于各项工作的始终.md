The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong District, Jiangsu Province, have fully mobilized the masses, overcome complacency, and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, promoting the flourishing development of the revolution and production.

The report states: The broad revolutionary masses of Nantong District, Jiangsu Province, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle" and that peasants "must also criticize the bourgeoisie." They have carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution, actively and continuously criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed.

Overcoming Complacency and Launching a Strong Offensive Against Class Enemies

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong District, the situation has been getting better and better. In the face of the overwhelmingly good situation across the district, some people have become complacent, saying things like, "We've already had criticism meetings, posted big-character posters, and set up criticism columns. We've already criticized revisionist fallacies. Now that the capitalist roaders have been overthrown and the revolutionary committees have been established, the Cultural Revolution is almost over. Spring production is so busy, we can put off criticism for now," and so on.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's latest instructions came: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership against the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Upon hearing this, the revolutionary committees at all levels in the district immediately organized large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the communes and brigades for propaganda. They organized the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to study and discuss while investigating the new trends in rural class struggle, exposing the various sabotage activities of class enemies, and fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu who advocate the theory of "class struggle extinction." This helped everyone further realize that the complacent and lax thoughts in some people's minds are very dangerous. They said, "With such complacency and laxity, one will lose vigilance, fail to see the enemy situation, and neglect class struggle; it will give the enemy an opportunity to launch a surprise attack, and there is a danger of losing proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, class struggle must be firmly remembered and cannot be forgotten; it must be firmly grasped and cannot be relaxed." Soon, the entire district launched a people's war of proactive attacks and comprehensive strikes against class enemies. Many criminals, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had hidden for a long time were exposed, quickly igniting a high tide of revolutionary criticism.

Integrating Revolutionary Criticism into All Tasks

After the high tide of revolutionary criticism swept through the entire district, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, all places in the district divided China's Khrushchev's fallacies into six topics: "class struggle extinction," "exploitation is meritorious," "three autonomies and one contract," "material incentives," and so on. They combined these with various tasks, linked them to local realities, and carried out targeted criticism, layer by layer peeling off the masks of China's Khrushchev and his agents, and step by step deepening the revolutionary criticism.

Now, many communes and brigades treat every task and every process of completing a task as a process of criticizing and repudiating oneself and criticizing revisionism. They learn from Chairman Mao's teachings, criticize revisionist fallacies, investigate local poisonous influences, expose the crimes of class enemies, reflect on their own understanding, fight their own selfishness, and discuss what should be done. During the spring plowing season this year, the eighth production team of Jiaoxi Brigade, Jiaozi Commune, Haian County, stopped and started revolutionary criticism, and production was sluggish. The brigade leadership took this issue, mobilized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle" and "criticizing and repudiating oneself and criticizing revisionism," fiercely criticized the theory of "class struggle extinction," and inspired everyone to open their eyes and expose the cover of class struggle in the brigade. Finally, they exposed a released labor reform criminal who had long been hiding in the eighth team. This criminal colluded with cadres, corrupted the masses, framed people, and sabotaged production, committing numerous crimes. The broad masses further heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Some masses who had been deceived, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, found the reasons for their deception, fiercely fought their own selfishness, and stood up to fight against class enemies.

During the cotton field preparation, Shengdong County treated the preparation process as a process of studying, criticizing, repudiating, and establishing. They used the fields and courtyards as battlefields, organized the broad masses to study the "Three Old Articles," fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "three autonomies and one contract," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander," and vigorously eliminated the poisonous influences of "planting cotton brings money, wearing red and green, eating fish and meat, turning thatched houses into tiled houses," and so on. This helped everyone further establish the idea of "standing at the mouth of the Yangtze River, looking towards Tiananmen, embracing the world, planting cotton for the revolution," quickly implementing the production plan.

The New Power Organs Have Played a Great Revolutionary Role

In leading the broad revolutionary masses in their struggles against the enemy, the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong District, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses," rushed to the grassroots, went to the front lines, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studied, labored, criticized and repudiated themselves, and criticized revisionism with the masses. They said, "The command post of class struggle cannot be set up in the county and commune offices but must be set up at the frontline positions of class struggle; the members of the revolutionary committees cannot stand at the rear of class struggle but must stand at the frontline of class struggle, serving as both commanders and fighters."

For example, the revolutionary committee of Xueshan Commune, Ruigang County, left only one member to handle daily work at home, while the rest of the members, carrying the Little Red Book and backpacks, went deep into the brigades and production teams to firmly grasp class struggle and promote production. After going down, the first thing they did was to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and use the perspective of class struggle and class analysis to observe and handle problems. The head of the commune revolutionary committee went to the first brigade, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants, conducted investigations, and grasped the activities of class enemies in the brigade: a rich peasant element had, in the spring of the previous year, secretly moved his family's grain, money, and goods in advance, then cried wolf to frame the poor and lower-middle peasants, attempting to launch a counterattack and settle old scores; another rich peasant element secretly engaged in speculation and profiteering, attempting to sabotage the current revolution and production. The head of the revolutionary committee used these facts as living teaching materials, guiding the broad masses to deeply criticize the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious," "three autonomies and one contract," and "class struggle extinction," helping everyone further understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions and igniting a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. After this experience was promoted from point to surface, the flames of revolutionary criticism in the entire commune burned more fiercely.

Revolutionary Criticism Promotes the Mass Movement of Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture

Last winter and this spring, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "the purpose of the socialist revolution is to liberate productive forces," Nantong District, after investigations and studies, determined the grain and cotton production increase plan for this year based on reality. To achieve this plan, various places, in response to the idea among some people that "efforts have already been made to the fullest, and production has reached its limit" and seeing too many difficulties, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "people must constantly summarize experience, discover, invent, create, and advance" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" and "self-reliance," criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in the locality who advocate the fallacy of "material incentives" and the ideas of conservatism, stagnation, and inaction.

Through extensive study and criticism, everyone realized that in production, whether to "defend" or "charge," whether to "rely on external aid" or "be self-reliant," is essentially a struggle between two lines and two paths. They consciously broke the spiritual shackles around their necks, resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," and launched a wave of walking the Dazhai path, learning from Dazhai people, promoting the Dazhai spirit, and planting Dazhai fields. Many communes and brigades that originally thought they lacked fertilizer and had production difficulties were even more enthusiastic, striving for the forefront, and launched a mass movement of accumulating and making fertilizer.

Iron arms sweep away harmful insects, silver hoes dance to show new faces. Now, the vast fields of Nantong District are surging with waves of wheat, and the summer crops are growing vigorously.

    将战斗指挥部设在阶级斗争的最前哨  把革命大批判贯穿于各项工作的始终
    南通专区各级革命委员会，充分发动群众，克服轻敌思想，深入开展革命大批判，推动革命和生产蓬勃发展
    本报讯　江苏省南通专区广大革命群众，牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和农民“也要批判资产阶级”的教导，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，主动地、持续深入地对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。
    克服麻痹轻敌思想主动向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    南通专区各级革命委员会建立以后，形势越来越好。在全区一片红的大好形势下，有些人居安思稳，麻痹轻敌，说什么批判会已经开过，大字报已经贴过，批判专栏已经搞过，修正主义谬论已经批过，“现在走资派打倒了，革委会成立了，文化大革命差不多了”，“春季生产这样忙，大批判可以暂时放一放”，等等。
    正当这个时候，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”全区各级革命委员会闻风而动，立刻组织大批的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入社队进行宣传。他们组织广大贫下中农和革命干部一边学习讨论，一边调查农村阶级斗争的新动向，揭发阶级敌人的种种破坏活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏的代理人所宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。这样就使大家进一步认识到，一些人头脑中存在的那种“革命到头”麻痹轻敌的思想，十分危险。他们说，有了这种麻痹轻敌思想，就会失去警惕，看不见敌情，忽视阶级斗争；就会给敌人以可乘之机，遭到敌人突然袭击，无产阶级政权就有丧失的危险，因此，阶级斗争只能牢记，不能忘记；只能狠抓，不能放松。全区上下，很快就打响了一场向阶级敌人主动进攻、全面出击的“人民战争”。一些罪恶累累、隐藏多年的叛徒、特务和反革命分子被揪出来了，迅速掀起了革命大批判的高潮。
    把革命大批判贯穿于各项任务的始终
    南通专区革命大批判的高潮掀起以后，全区各地在解放军的帮助下，把中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论分为“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”等六个专题，结合各项任务，联系本地实际，有目的地进行批判，一层一层地剥开中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的画皮，一步一步地把革命大批判引向深入。
    现在，许多社队把每做一件事情，每完成一项任务的过程，都当作斗私、批修的过程。他们每做一件事情，每执行一项任务，都要学毛主席的教导，批修正主义的谬论，查本地区的流毒，揭阶级敌人的罪行，想自己的认识，斗自己的私心，议应该怎么办。今年春耕季节，海安县角斜公社角西大队第八生产队革命大批判搞搞停停，生产冷冷清清。大队领导班子便带着这个问题，发动群众学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“要斗私，批修”的教导，狠批了“阶级斗争熄灭”论，启发大家擦亮眼睛，狠揭本大队阶级斗争的盖子，终于揭发出长期隐藏在八队的一个释放的劳改犯。这个罪犯拉拢干部、腐蚀群众、陷害人命、破坏生产，作恶多端。广大群众进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。原来有些受蒙蔽的群众，对照毛主席的教导，找到了自己受蒙蔽的原因，狠斗了自己的私心，纷纷起来向阶级敌人作斗争。
    在棉田备耕中，启东县把备耕的过程作为大学、大批、大破、大立的过程。他们以田间、场头为阵地，组织广大群众学习“老三篇”，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等谬论，大力肃清“种了棉花，钞票活络，穿红着绿，吃鱼吃肉，草屋变瓦屋”等流毒，使大家进一步树立了“站在长江口，眼望天安门，胸怀全世界，为革命种棉”的思想，迅速落实了生产规划。
    新生的权力机构发挥了巨大的革命作用
    在领导广大革命群众对敌斗争中，南通专区各级革命委员会的成员，遵照毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，纷纷奔赴基层，深入第一线，宣传毛主席的最新指示，与群众同学习，同劳动，同斗私，同批修。他们说，阶级斗争的战斗指挥部，不能设在县、社机关里，而要设在阶级斗争的前哨阵地上；革命委员会的每一个成员，不能站在阶级斗争的后方，而要站在阶级斗争的最前哨，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。
    如皋县雪岸公社革命委员会，除留下一个委员在家里处理日常工作外，其余的委员手持宝书，背着行李，分别深入大队、生产队去狠抓阶级斗争，猛促生产。他们下去以后，第一件事就是和贫下中农一起，活学活用毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示，用阶级斗争的观点、阶级分析的方法，观察和处理问题。公社革委会负责人来到一大队，和贫下中农一起学习了毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的最新指示，经过调查研究，掌握了这个大队的阶级敌人的活动：有一个富农分子，去年春天事先转移了自己家里的粮、钱、物，然后贼喊捉贼，妄图陷害贫下中农，进行反攻倒算；另一个富农分子，偷偷摸摸地搞投机倒把活动，妄图破坏当前的革命和生产。革委会负责人把这些事实作为活教材，引导广大群众深入地批判了“剥削有功”、“三自一包”和“阶级斗争熄灭”等谬论，使大家进一步领会了毛主席的最新指示，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。这个经验由点到面地推广以后，全公社革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。
    革命大批判推动了农业学大寨的群众运动
    去冬今春，南通专区遵照毛主席关于“社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力”的教导，经过调查研究，从实际出发，确定了今年粮棉增产计划。为实现这个计划，各地针对一部分人中“劲头已经使足了，产量已经到头了”和过多地看到困难的思想，学习了毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”和“备战、备荒、为人民”以及“自力更生”的教导，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地的代理人所宣扬的“物质刺激”的谬论和因循守旧、停滞不前、无所作为的思想。
    通过大学习、大批判，大家认识到在生产上是“守”还是“闯”，是“依赖外援”还是“自力更生”，实质上就是两条道路、两条路线的斗争。他们自觉地打碎套在自己脖子上的精神枷锁，坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，掀起了走大寨路、学大寨人、兴大寨风、种大寨田的热潮。许多原来认为肥源不足、生产上有困难的社队，更是大鼓干劲，力争上游，开展了积肥造肥的群众运动。
    铁臂横扫害人虫，银锄起舞展新容。现在，南通专区广阔的田野，麦海涌起千重浪，夏熟作物的长势喜人。
