The Thai Patriotic Workers' Union recently issued a statement calling on the Thai working class to actively participate in the revolutionary armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand. The statement urges the integration of Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of the Thai revolution to drive out American aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Prapas co-sellout clique, striving to build a new Thailand.

The statement says that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai working class has a glorious history of fighting against domestic and foreign class enemies. Currently, Thai workers are actively participating in and supporting the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party. Workers' organizations have significantly expanded in the course of this struggle.

The statement points out that due to the intensified aggression of American imperialism and the escalating betrayal by the Thanom-Prapas clique, Thailand has become a military base for American imperialist aggression. The ruthless exploitation and plunder by the American-Thanon clique have plunged the Thai people into a sea of suffering. Therefore, the patriotic struggle against American imperialist aggression and the sellout dictatorship of the Thanom-Prapas clique is continuously developing, and the flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning everywhere.

The statement emphasizes that the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party has shown the Thai people a bright future. The Thai revolutionary armed struggle has once again proven the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "...Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

The statement says that the Thai working class, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and led by the Communist Party of Thailand, bears the glorious and arduous task of revolution. The Thai working class must raise high the great red banner of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, integrate Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of the Thai revolution, learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution and transform their worldview.

The statement says that the American-Thanon clique is most afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for revolutionary people to defeat their enemies. The American-Thanon clique is most afraid of the Communist Party of Thailand because the Communist Party of Thailand is a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a party that truly represents the interests of the Thai people, and a party that fights completely and thoroughly for the people's interests.

The statement says that although the Thai revolutionary struggle will face difficulties, the future is bright. As long as the Thai working class unites more closely and unites with other revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, resolutely engages in revolutionary armed struggle, it will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties, defeat the enemy, and achieve the final victory of the revolution.

    打倒美泰反动派　建立人民新泰国
    把毛泽东思想与泰国革命具体实践相结合就能取得革命最后胜利
    新华社十日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台九日广播，泰国爱国工人联合会最近发表文告，号召泰国工人阶级在泰国共产党领导下，把毛泽东思想与泰国革命具体实践相结合，积极参加革命武装斗争，为赶走美国侵略者和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，建立一个新泰国而奋斗。
    文告说，在泰国共产党领导下的泰国工人阶级，具有同国内外阶级敌人进行斗争的光荣历史。当前，泰国工人积极参加和支持在泰共领导下的革命武装斗争。泰国工人组织在斗争中已得到广泛的发展。
    文告指出，由于美帝国主义的加紧侵略和他侬—巴博集团的变本加厉的出卖，泰国已经完全变成了美帝国主义的侵略军事基地。美国—他侬集团穷凶极恶的剥削和掠夺，使泰国人民生活在水深火热之中。因此，反对美帝国主义的侵略和他侬—巴博集团的卖国独裁统治的爱国斗争不断发展，革命武装斗争的烈火到处燃烧。
    文告强调指出，泰共领导下的革命武装斗争，给泰国人民指出了光明的前途。泰国革命武装斗争又一次证明了毛主席指出的真理：“……离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    文告说，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的泰国共产党所领导的泰国工人阶级，担负着光荣而又艰巨的革命任务。泰国工人阶级必须更高地举起当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想与泰国革命具体实践相结合，学习和运用毛泽东思想，指导革命和改造自己的世界观。
    文告说，美国—他侬集团最害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想是革命人民战胜敌人的强大思想武器。美国—他侬集团最害怕泰国共产党，因为泰国共产党是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的政党，是真正代表泰国人民利益的，是完全彻底为人民的利益而斗争的政党。
    文告说，尽管泰国革命斗争还会有困难，但是，前途是光明的。只要泰国工人阶级更紧密地团结起来，并且团结其他广大革命群众，在泰国共产党领导下坚决进行革命武装斗争，就一定能够克服任何困难，战胜敌人，取得革命的最后胜利。
