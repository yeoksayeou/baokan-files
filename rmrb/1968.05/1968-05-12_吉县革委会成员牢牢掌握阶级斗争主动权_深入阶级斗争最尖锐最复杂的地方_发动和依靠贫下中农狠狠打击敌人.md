Members of the Jixian County Revolutionary Committee firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle, delve into the most acute and complex areas of class struggle, and mobilize and rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to severely strike down the enemy.

Members of the Jixian County Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching "Never forget class struggle," have conducted investigations and research in the most acute and complex areas of class struggle, grasped the initiative in class struggle, and mobilized and relied on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in Jixian County last year, a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, along with other counter-revolutionaries, joined forces, colluded, and spread poisonous winds, set off ghost fires, and shot dark arrows, attacking the newly born revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army, and striking down the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. In response to this situation, the committee members seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They extensively exposed the situation of class struggle and listed the crimes of the class enemies. Many vivid facts of class struggle educated the members of the revolutionary committee. Everyone realized that the more the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops and approaches comprehensive victory, the more the enemies of the proletariat will struggle desperately. If we only see the victory and do not see the complexity and depth of class struggle, we will lose vigilance and give the enemies of the proletariat the opportunity to breathe and counterattack, and even risk losing the proletarian dictatorship.

Therefore, the Jixian County Revolutionary Committee, while leaving two standing committee members to firmly grasp the class struggle in the county-level organs, had the remaining standing committee members and committee members lead the organ cadres, carrying their luggage, to go to the grassroots in the countryside. Where the class contradictions were most prominent, where the class struggle was most acute, they went there. They mobilized the masses and, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, studied Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions on class struggle, analyzed the class struggle situation and characteristics of the local area, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and helped each commune and production brigade, in conjunction with the actual class struggle of their locality, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, exposing and criticizing the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies, making the revolutionary criticism fire in the Jixian countryside burn more fiercely.

A leader of the revolutionary committee led some cadres to the most acute area of class struggle in Chengguan Commune. Relying on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, they investigated the class struggle situation in each production brigade and discovered that some untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists had colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in society, waving the banner of "rebellion," striking down the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and crazily carrying out class revenge. They also spread the evil winds of economism and the black wind of individual farming, using every means to sabotage the socialist collective economy. In response to this situation, the leaders of the Jixian County Revolutionary Committee helped the commune cadres and members hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with them repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions on class struggle. They mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to expose those class enemies who sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and spring farming, severely striking down their reactionary arrogance. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres smashed the evil activities of a handful of class enemies attempting to restore capitalism, and the entire commune presented a scene of revolutionary fervor and production enthusiasm.

During the help given to each commune and production brigade to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary committee members discovered that some rural cadres were worried that the revolutionary criticism would squeeze out production. They organized rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously study the editorials in the People's Daily and other publications on carrying out revolutionary criticism, making everyone realize that whether or not to carry out revolutionary criticism is a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary masses of the proletariat can grasp and use power properly. After the broad rural cadres raised their awareness, they systematically criticized the revisionist black goods of China's Khrushchev, such as the "extinction of class struggle" theory, "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and the "peach garden experience," striking a powerful blow to the class enemies and tempering the revolutionary masses. A leader of the revolutionary committee went to Anping Brigade in Zhongdun Commune and found that the class enemies were spreading the evil wind of reversing cases, sowing discord among the brigade cadres, affecting the production of the brigade. He then helped the brigade hold a study class with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Throughout the transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Forgetting this basic theory and basic practice of our party for more than ten years will lead us astray." Everyone ate a bitter meal together and held a bitter remembrance meeting, further arousing deep hatred towards the class enemies and severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the "extinction of class struggle" theory. Subsequently, they mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the initiative to strike down the class enemies, exposing and fighting against the counter-revolutionary elements who incited the masses to fight the masses, and striking down the evil wind of reversing cases, making the brigade quickly achieve revolutionary great unity, and the cadres also strengthened their unity.

The leaders of the revolutionary committee went deep into the grassroots, eating, living, studying, laboring, and fighting with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply rooted among the masses, and closely connected with the broad masses. At the same time, they were tempered and trained in the great storms of the masses' struggle, strengthening their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and promoting their ideological revolutionization.

    吉县革委会成员牢牢掌握阶级斗争主动权
    深入阶级斗争最尖锐最复杂的地方
    发动和依靠贫下中农狠狠打击敌人
    新华社太原十一日电　山西省吉县革命委员会领导成员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，到阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂的地方调查研究，掌握阶级斗争的主动权，发动和依靠广大贫下中农和革命干部，向无产阶级的敌人展开猛烈进攻，进一步巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。
    吉县在去年成立革命委员会以后，一小撮死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子以及其他反革命分子，狼狈为奸，互相勾结，到处煽阴风，点鬼火，放暗箭，攻击新生的革命委员会和人民解放军，打击贫下中农和革命干部。针对这种情况，革委会成员认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们大摆阶级斗争的情况，大列阶级敌人的罪状。许多活生生的阶级斗争事实，教育了革命委员会的成员。大家认识到，无产阶级文化大革命形势越是大好，越接近全面胜利，无产阶级的敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。我们如果只看到胜利，而看不到阶级斗争的复杂性和深刻性，就会丧失警惕，给无产阶级的敌人以喘息和反扑的机会，甚至有丧失无产阶级政权的危险。
    于是，吉县革命委员会除留下两个常委狠抓县直机关的阶级斗争外，其余常委和委员带领机关干部，身背行李，到农村基层去。那里阶级矛盾最突出，那里阶级斗争最尖锐，他们就到那里。他们放手发动群众，和广大贫下中农、革命干部一起学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和最新指示，一起分析当地阶级斗争的形势和特点，一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助各公社、生产大队结合本地阶级斗争的实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，揭发、批判一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动，使革命大批判的烈火在吉县农村越烧越旺。
    革委会的一位领导成员带领一些干部，到阶级斗争最尖锐的城关公社后，依靠广大贫下中农和革命干部，调查了各生产大队的阶级斗争情况，发现一些没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，和社会上国民党反动派的残渣余孽勾结起来，打起“造反”的旗号，打击贫下中农和革命干部，疯狂地进行阶级报复，并且大刮经济主义妖风，大刮单干黑风，千方百计地破坏社会主义集体经济。针对这种情况，吉县革委会领导成员帮助公社的干部和社员举办了毛泽东思想学习班，和他们一起反复学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和最新指示，发动广大贫下中农把那些破坏无产阶级文化大革命和春耕生产的阶级敌人揭露出来，狠狠打击他们的反动气焰。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”广大贫下中农和农村干部击溃了一小撮阶级敌人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，整个公社出现了革命轰轰烈烈、生产热气腾腾的景象。
    吉县革委会成员在帮助各公社、生产大队深入持久地开展革命大批判时，发现有些农村干部担心革命大批判挤掉生产，他们就组织农村干部和贫下中农认真学习《人民日报》等报刊关于开展革命大批判的社论，使大家认识到，搞不搞革命大批判，是关系到无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权的大事。广大农村干部提高认识以后，结合本地两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，系统地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、
  “桃园经验”等反革命修正主义黑货，有力地打击了阶级敌人，锻炼了革命群众。革委会一位领导成员到中垛公社安平大队，发现阶级敌人大刮翻案妖风，挑拨生产队干部之间的团结，使这个大队的生产受到了影响。他便帮助大队举办有贫下中农参加的学习班，组织大家学习毛主席的教导：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”大家共吃忆苦饭，共开忆苦会，进一步激发了对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。接着，他们又发动贫下中农向阶级敌人主动出击，揭露和斗争了挑动群众斗群众的反革命分子，迎头痛击了翻案妖风，使这个大队很快实现了革命大联合，干部之间也增强了团结。
    革委会领导成员深入基层，与广大贫下中农同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同斗争，深深扎根于群众之中，密切了与广大群众的联系，同时，也在群众斗争的大风大浪里经受了考验和锻炼，增强了阶级斗争与路线斗争观念，促进了思想革命化。
