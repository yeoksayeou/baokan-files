Preliminary reports indicate that the shells accurately hit their targets, destroying numerous cannons, warehouses, and tents, and killing and wounding a large number of American invaders.

On April 26, the Liberation Forces in the northern region of Quang Tri Province bravely fought back against a "sweeping" operation by the Americans near Kun Tian. After several hours of fierce combat, they repelled five counterattacks by an American reconnaissance platoon, severely damaging the platoon and destroying two tanks. On April 29, the Liberation Forces in the northern region of Quang Tri Province fiercely intercepted a group of American and puppet troops near Dong Ha.

On the morning of April 30, the Liberation Forces sank three American transport ships on the Viet River.

The Liberation Forces in Binh Dinh Province intercepted and attacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations on April 4, 7, 18, and 24, annihilating more than 470 enemy troops, almost all of whom were American invaders.

The Liberation Forces in the southern region of Long An Province launched fierce attacks on the American and puppet troops conducting "sweeping" operations over four days from April 18 to 22. In the areas of Chau Thanh, Tan Chau, and Tan Phu, they annihilated more than 300 enemy troops, including severely damaging a puppet security platoon. The Liberation Forces also launched fierce attacks on enemy bases and military headquarters, completely annihilating a main platoon, a security platoon, and a security squad of the 46th Battalion, 25th Division of the puppet army in Tan Phu County, and severely damaging a security platoon and a security squad.

In Quang Ngai Province, the enemy deployed eight battalions to conduct "sweeping" operations in Thuan Yen and Nghia Hanh counties from April 8 to 17. Local guerrilla forces were well-prepared, and the enemy encountered pitfalls and traps everywhere they went, with tens of enemy troops being annihilated daily. From April 8 to 17, the guerrilla forces in these two counties annihilated more than 250 American and puppet troops.

The Liberation Forces in An Xuyen Province thwarted the enemy's "sweeping" operations aimed at relieving the siege around An Xuyen City on April 20 and 21. Preliminary reports indicate that they killed and wounded more than 200 enemy troops, damaged three M-113 armored vehicles, and sank and seized one patrol boat each.

According to a report from Xuan Loc, the Liberation Forces in Thua Thien Province have recently launched fierce attacks on the invading American and puppet troops in the Ashau Valley.

According to Western news agencies, in recent days, the American invaders have assembled nearly 20,000 American and puppet troops to launch a mad assault on the Ashau Valley west of Hue City, encountering fierce resistance from the Liberation Forces. The helicopter units of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division were subjected to fierce attacks by the Liberation Forces. Shortly after the battle began, 45 American helicopters were shot down and destroyed. Even the commander of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division exclaimed, "Unlucky," saying this was the "heaviest loss of helicopters in a single day" his troops had suffered recently.
