Representatives from various sectors of Hebei Province and Comrade Men He's relatives all expressed their determination to respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to launch a vigorous campaign to learn from Comrade Men He, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts to a new stage, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, May 29th - Recently, a mass rally was held in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, the hometown of Comrade Men He, to celebrate the honor bestowed upon him by our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. The honor, "A Good Cadre Who is Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line," was approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

	On the day of the rally, Laiyuan County was adorned with red flags, and propaganda columns showcasing Comrade Men He's heroic deeds lined the streets. Large banners calling for learning from Comrade Men He were posted everywhere. Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, soldiers, and militia members, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," drums, and gongs, gathered to participate in the celebration.

	The rally began with the stirring song "The East is Red." The attendees then read aloud Chairman Mao's quotation: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have laid down their lives for the people's interests in front of us, let us hold high their banner and march forward along the path they have opened up with their blood!" They collectively wished for the long life of the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

	After the order from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously confer the honor of "A Good Cadre Who is Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" on Comrade Men He was read, Vice Chairman Liu Dianchen of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee, on behalf of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee and the 43 million people of the province, expressed their enthusiastic support and firm implementation of the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. He emphasized that at this critical moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, we must first learn from Comrade Men He's unwavering stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and engage in a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism to completely eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei, and to root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. Liu Dianchen also pointed out that Comrade Men He is an outstanding representative of the People's Liberation Army. Learning from Comrade Men He means to learn from the army and to strengthen military-civilian unity, further implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "supporting the army and loving the people."

	General Staff Director Shang Suzhi of the Hebei Military Region, in his speech, called on the officers and soldiers of the Hebei Military Region and the militia of the entire province to extensively and deeply carry out the campaign to learn from Comrade Men He, truly regarding being unlimitedly loyal to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the first priority, and regarding executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a sacred duty. He demanded that all levels of cadres, especially leading cadres, remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not relying on past merits but creating new ones," humbly learn from Comrade Men He, and do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work to create new achievements for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, militia members, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and Comrade Men He's relatives from Hebei Province spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, to launch a vigorous campaign to learn from Comrade Men He in his hometown, to make Comrade Men He's brilliant deeds known to every household, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts to a new stage, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to make Comrade Men He's hometown a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Amidst enthusiastic applause, the Hebei Revolutionary Committee and the Hebei Military Region presented Comrade Men He's family with revolutionary classics "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," a large bust of the great leader Chairman Mao, and shining gold Mao badges.

	After the meeting, the leaders of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee and the Hebei Military Region, on behalf of the people of the entire province and all officers and soldiers of the Hebei Military Region, visited Comrade Men He's family for a warm consolation.
