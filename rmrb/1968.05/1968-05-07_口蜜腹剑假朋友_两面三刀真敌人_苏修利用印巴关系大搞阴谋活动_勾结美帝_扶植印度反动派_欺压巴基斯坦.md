The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has recently been engaged in various intrigues exploiting the relationship between India and Pakistan. On the surface, it pretends to be eager to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries. In reality, it colludes with American imperialism to continue its policy of supporting the Indian reactionaries and oppressing Pakistan.

In late January, Soviet head of state Alexei Kosygin led a large delegation to India for a six-day visit. Three months later, in late April, he rushed to Pakistan. Notably, after concluding his visit to Pakistan, Kosygin made a special detour to New Delhi to hold a ninety-minute "frank and secret" meeting with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. According to reports, no aides were present during their private talks.

Kosygin hurriedly shuttled between India and Pakistan, singing the siren song of "easing international tensions," claiming that "we support the best possible relations between India and Pakistan." He attempted to portray himself as an "angel of peace" to deceive the people of India and Pakistan. However, the Soviet revisionist clique's heinous actions of aiding the Indian reactionary government in expanding its military arsenal have thoroughly exposed Kosygin's hypocritical statements.

The Soviet revisionist clique, in close coordination with American imperialism, has provided the Indian reactionaries with substantial military aid. After the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale armed attack on China in 1962, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union supplied them with large quantities of military equipment. The Indian reactionaries later used this equipment to invade Pakistan in 1965. The U.S. helped the Indian reactionaries equip six mountain divisions, providing radar equipment and factory facilities. The Soviet Union primarily aided the Indian reactionaries in developing their naval and air forces, helping to build two large steel plants and other heavy industrial enterprises, creating conditions for the Indian reactionaries to further develop their military industry.

As many Pakistani newspapers have exposed, the U.S. and the Soviet Union armed the Indian reactionaries with the aim of containing China, but this has increased the threat of aggression against Pakistan.

It is worth noting that after the Indian reactionaries launched an armed invasion of Pakistan in 1965, the Soviet Union pretended to be an impartial mediator, conducting "negotiations." In reality, it continued to favor India. Under Kosygin's involvement, the governments of India and Pakistan issued a "Tashkent Declaration." However, before the ink on this declaration had dried, Soviet military aid continued to arrive at the port of Calcutta in India, including over 400 tanks, 150mm long-range artillery, and surface-to-air missiles. Afterward, the Soviet Union and the Indian reactionaries signed multiple military aid agreements, providing the Indian reactionaries with over 170 Su-7 fighter-bombers, helicopters, submarines, and other naval vessels. The Soviet Union also helped the Indian reactionary government expand its naval base.

According to Indian newspapers, during this visit to India, Kosygin expressed that the Soviet clique would not change its policy of continuing to provide military aid to the Indian reactionaries.

These facts show that while the Soviet clique claims to want to "ease Indo-Pakistan tensions," in reality, it is vigorously arming the Indian reactionaries, making them daring to create tensions and conduct external aggression.

When Kosygin visited Pakistan, he acted as if he were a friend of the Pakistani people. However, in a speech in Lahore, he revealed his true colors. Kosygin not only did not support the people of Lahore in their just resistance against the Indian invasion in 1965 but also said, "The people of Lahore, who are on the front line of the Indo-Pakistan War, you know that war is a terrible disaster." This Soviet leader attempted to use the "terror of war" to intimidate the Pakistani people, making them submit to the Indian reactionaries armed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Kosygin sang the tune of "Soviet-Pakistani cooperation" in Pakistan, feigning to aid Pakistan. However, one of his true purposes was to sow discord between China and Pakistan, opposing China. On April 17, during a banquet speech, Kosygin openly attacked China. According to the *Pakistan Times*, he insidiously said, "In Asia, there are other forces that want to establish their own hegemony here." This newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with Kosygin's remarks on Pakistani soil, which has friendly relations with China. The Indian reactionaries' mouthpiece, All India Radio, had attacked the Pakistani radio for not broadcasting Kosygin's statement. The *Pakistan Times* refuted All India Radio's accusation.

Over the past few months, Pakistani government officials, people from all walks of life, and newspapers have published numerous statements, severely criticizing the Soviet Union's actions in aiding the Indian reactionaries' military buildup. An increasing number of Indian people have also recognized the evil intentions behind the Soviet Union's military and economic "aid" to the Indian reactionaries. Like the Americans, the Soviet revisionist clique is a hypocritical schemer, a false friend and true enemy of the people of India and Pakistan.

　　口蜜腹剑假朋友　两面三刀真敌人
　　苏修利用印巴关系大搞阴谋活动
　　勾结美帝　扶植印度反动派　欺压巴基斯坦
    据新华社四日讯　本社记者报道：苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团最近利用印度和巴基斯坦两国关系问题进行了种种阴谋活动。它表面上装出很想促进印巴两国关系正常化的样子，实际上同美帝国主义互相勾结，继续执行扶植印度反动派和欺压巴基斯坦的既定政策。
    苏修头目柯西金在一月底曾率领一个庞大的代表团到印度活动了六天。过了三个月，他在四月底又跑到巴基斯坦去。引人注目的是，柯西金在结束访巴后，特意绕道新德里，同印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地进行了九十分钟的“坦率的秘密会谈”。据报道，在他们密谈的过程中，没有任何助手在场。
    柯西金风尘仆仆地在印巴两国之间奔走，并高唱“缓和国际紧张局势”的迷魂曲，叫嚷什么“我们赞成印巴之间建立最好不过的关系”，妄图把自己装扮成“促使印巴和解”的天使，借以欺骗印巴两国人民。但是，苏修叛徒集团猖狂地帮助印度反动政府扩充军备的罪恶行径，彻底揭穿了柯西金的这些虚伪言论。
    苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义密切配合，给予印度反动派大量军事援助。一九六二年印度反动派向中国发动大规模武装进攻之后，美帝苏修都向它提供大量军事装备。印度反动派后来利用这些装备，在一九六五年向巴基斯坦发动了武装侵略。美帝帮助印度反动派装备了六个山地师，提供了雷达设备和兵工厂设备。苏修主要帮助印度反动派发展海空军，同时帮助印度修建两座大型钢厂和其它重工业企业，为印度反动派进一步发展军火生产创造条件。
    正象巴基斯坦的许多报刊所揭露的一样，美帝苏修以反华为目的武装印度反动派，但是这使巴基斯坦受到越来越大的侵略威胁。
    值得注意的是，一九六五年印度反动派向巴基斯坦发动武装侵略之后，苏修装出一个公正的调解人的姿态进行“斡旋”，实际上继续偏袒印度。在柯西金的参与下，由印巴两国政府发表了一个“塔什干宣言”。可是，这项宣言的墨迹未干，苏修叛徒集团的军火又继续运到印度的加尔各答港，其中包括四百多辆坦克、一百五十毫米的远射程大炮和地对空导弹。在这以后，苏修同印度反动派又签订了多项军事援助协定，向印度反动派提供一百七十多架苏—7型战斗轰炸机以及直升飞机、潜水艇和其它海军舰艇等。苏修还帮助印度反动政府扩建海军基地。
    据印度报刊透露，柯西金在这次访问印度期间，表示苏修集团不会改变它继续向印度反动派提供军事援助的政策。
    这些事实表明，苏修集团口口声声说要“缓和印巴局势”，实际上却竭力去武装印度反动派，使它敢于制造紧张局势，进行对外侵略。
    柯西金这次到巴基斯坦活动时，俨然以巴基斯坦人民的朋友自居。但是，他在拉合尔的一次讲话中露出了真面目。柯西金不但不支持拉合尔人民在一九六五年抵抗印度侵略的正义行动，反而说：“地处印巴战争前线的拉合尔人民，你们知道战争是一场可怕的灾难。”这个苏修头子企图用“战争恐怖”来威吓巴基斯坦人民，使他们向美帝苏修武装起来的印度反动派屈服。
    柯西金在巴基斯坦高唱“苏巴合作”的调子，作出“援助”巴基斯坦的姿态，但是他的真实目的之一是挑拨中巴关系，反对中国。柯西金四月十七日在宴会上发表讲话时，公然影射攻击中国。据《巴基斯坦时报》报道，他别有用心地说什么“在亚洲有其它势力想在这里建立自己的霸权”。这家报纸对柯西金在同中国有友好关系的巴基斯坦国土上说这样的话，表示不满。印度反动派的喉舌全印电台曾经攻击巴基斯坦电台没有广播柯西金的这句话。《巴基斯坦时报》驳斥了全印电台的指责。
    过去几个月来，巴基斯坦的政府官员、各界人士和报刊，发表大量言论，严正地抨击苏修帮助印度反动派扩军的行径。越来越多的印度人民也认识到苏修给予印度反动派军事和经济“援助”的罪恶用心。同美帝一样，苏修叛徒集团是“口蜜腹剑”的阴谋家，是印巴两国人民的假朋友、真敌人。
