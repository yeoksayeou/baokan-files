Lao People's Party Central Committee strongly condemns U.S. imperialism's use of chemical weapons in Laos and calls for national unity to defeat U.S. imperialism

	New China News Agency, Khamkeut, May 4th - According to the Pathet Lao News Agency: The Central Committee of the Lao People's Party issued a statement on April 29th, strongly protesting and condemning the U.S. imperialists' use of chemical weapons in southern Laos, poisoning the Lao people in a heinous crime.

	The statement pointed out that this extremely brutal and barbaric fascist atrocity by U.S. imperialism once again exposed its bloodthirsty and warlike nature.

	The use of chemical weapons by U.S. imperialism to massacre people on a large scale does not indicate its strength. On the contrary, it only shows that it is in a predicament in Laos and is desperately struggling in its death throes.

	The statement demands that U.S. imperialism immediately stop its evil actions of bombing, strafing, and using chemical weapons to massacre the Lao people, and withdraw all U.S. and its lackeys' military personnel and war tools from Laos, allowing the Lao people to solve their own internal affairs.

	The statement calls on the Lao people nationwide to strengthen unity, fight resolutely, and defeat all U.S. imperialism's war "escalations" in Laos.

	The statement finally sternly warns U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: If they continue to obstinately and recklessly escalate the war and massacre the Lao people, they will face even more severe punishment.

　　老挝爱国战线党中央强烈谴责美帝在老挝撒放化学毒药
　　号召全国人民加强团结坚决战斗打败美帝
    新华社康开四日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人四月二十九日发表声明，强烈抗议和谴责美帝国主义在老挝南方撒放化学毒药，毒害老挝人民的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这一无比残暴和野蛮的法西斯暴行，又一次暴露了它嗜血成性和好战的面目。
    美帝国主义使用化学毒药大规模屠杀人民，并不表明它的强大，相反，只能说明它在老挝已经陷于困境，正在疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。
    声明要求美帝国主义立即停止轰炸、扫射和使用化学毒药屠杀老挝人民的罪恶行动，把美国及其帮凶的军事人员和作战工具全部撤出老挝，让老挝人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
    声明号召老挝全国人民加强团结，坚决斗争，打败美帝国主义在老挝的一切战争“升级”。
    声明最后严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗：如果他们仍然顽固和冒险地在老挝进行战争“升级”和屠杀老挝人民，必将遭到更严厉的惩罚。
