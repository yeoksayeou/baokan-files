The revolutionary employees of the Yangtze River Shipping Company, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle." They have actively launched attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, resulting in a great situation in both revolution and production.

Since this year, on the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River shipping line, fleets of ships loaded with agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, draft cattle, and minerals, coal, and gravel have been coming and going, presenting a thriving scene. In the past few months, the total turnover of the Yangtze River shipping system has been increasing month by month, with the average daily transport volume in April being 22.6 percent higher than the first quarter.

The fundamental reason for the good situation in the Yangtze River shipping system is that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized to an unprecedented extent. Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions have been quickly implemented in various sub-companies, ports, shipyards, shipping, and ships. The revolutionary employees have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 80 percent of the revolutionary employees participating in the study. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions in the study classes, taking the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads as the key, taking the "Three Old Articles" as their motto, and fighting against the "self" and criticizing revisionism. They have consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Now, the vast majority of grassroots units in the entire shipping system have established revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups. They have led the revolutionary employees to focus on the revolution and vigorously promote production, pushing the revolution and production forward.

    毛泽东思想大普及　革命精神大发扬
    万里长江航运线一片繁荣景象
    据新华社武汉十九日电　长江航运公司广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，主动地向无产阶级的敌人发动进攻，使革命、生产出现大好局面。
    今年以来，在万里长江航运线上，满载着农业机械、化肥、农药、种子、耕牛和矿石、煤炭、砂石的船队，往来如梭，呈现一片繁荣景象。最近几个月来，长江航运系统运输总周转量月月上升，四月份平均日运量比第一季度平均增长百分之二十二点六。
    长江航运系统形势大好的根本原因，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及。毛主席的一系列最新指示，在各分公司、港口、船厂、航运、轮船上迅速落实。广大革命职工举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，百分之八十以上的革命职工参加了学习。他们在学习班里反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述和毛主席的一系列最新指示，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗“私”字，狠批修正主义，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。现在，全航运系统绝大多数的基层单位已建立了革命委员会和革命领导小组。他们带领广大革命职工，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把革命和生产推向前进。
