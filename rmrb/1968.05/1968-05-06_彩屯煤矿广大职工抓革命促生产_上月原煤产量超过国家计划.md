The broad masses of revolutionary workers at the Cai Tun Coal Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle." They have taken the initiative to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, striking down the reactionary arrogance of the class enemy, raising the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses, and bringing about a completely new situation in both revolution and production at the mine. Currently, the mine has achieved revolutionary great alliance and established the Cai Tun Mine Revolutionary Committee.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and are striving to surpass others with great enthusiasm. In April of this year, the mine's total coal production exceeded the state plan by 1,220 tons, setting a new monthly production record in nearly a year. The advance rate of tunneling increased by 5.5 percent compared to March, the utilization rate of pit props decreased, and the recovery rate of pit props also improved accordingly, saving the state a large amount of timber.

　　彩屯煤矿广大职工抓革命促生产
    上月原煤产量超过国家计划
    本溪矿务局彩屯煤矿广大革命职工，在驻矿人民解放军的大力帮助下，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，打击了阶级敌人的反动气焰，提高了广大革命群众阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，使全矿革命和生产出现崭新的面貌。目前，这个矿已经实现了革命大联合，成立了彩屯矿革命委员会。
    广大革命职工认真执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游。今年四月份，全矿的原煤产量超过国家计划一千二百二十吨，创造了近一年来的月产最新纪录。掘进进尺比三月份提高百分之五点五，坑木使用率下降，坑木回收率也相应有所提高，为国家节约了大量木材。
