The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, have smashed the sabotage activities of class enemies. Railway transportation production has improved month by month, and the overall transportation order is excellent.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai dated May 11 states: The broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have displayed the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. They have vigorously promoted revolution and production, achieving double victories in both areas. Currently, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has achieved revolutionary unity across the entire line. Revolutionary committees have been established in the bureau and in the majority of sub-bureaus, stations, and sections. Since the beginning of this year, railway transportation production has improved by the decade, with each month surpassing the previous one. The average daily volume of goods loading and unloading in April increased by 27% and 41% respectively compared to the first quarter. The overall transportation order is excellent.

The lines managed by the Shanghai Railway Bureau connect several important industrial and mining areas and cities in our country. The broad masses of railway workers fully recognize the heavy responsibilities they bear. They exert their utmost efforts to prioritize the transportation of coal, timber, oil, steel, grain, and other important materials for the national economy. Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has frequently dispatched special trains in coordination with neighboring bureaus to quickly transport coal from places like Huainan and Pingxiang to various parts of the country. The Shanghai Railway Bureau also regularly inquires about the production situation of important materials from neighboring bureaus and relevant departments, proactively arranging and dispatching trains to ensure timely loading. A large quantity of industrial and agricultural products, as well as daily necessities for the people, are continuously transported to cities and rural areas across the country, providing strong support for local markets.

"Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's revolution is the locomotive of historical progress." The broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that railway transportation is guided by Mao Zedong Thought and advancing along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. Currently, in the passenger cars on lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou, various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established. Train crew members and passengers study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together and discuss the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of railway workers, with class struggle and line struggle as the key, have focused on combating the enemy. In the struggle to smash the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of class enemies, they have ensured the normal operation of railway transportation. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the Shanghai Railway Bureau, unwilling to accept their demise, have on one hand adopted the counter-revolutionary tactic of "infiltrating and pulling out" to split revolutionary mass organizations and disrupt revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. On the other hand, they have conspired to seize leadership, colluding with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to create incidents along the railway, instigate armed struggles, and attempt to paralyze the railway and disrupt transportation. The broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and supported by the People's Liberation Army, have never forgotten class struggle. They have exposed this small clique of capitalist roaders and black hands who instigated armed struggles, disrupted the revolution, and sabotaged railway transportation. They have smashed rightist reversal activities, ensuring the timely transportation of important materials needed for industrial and agricultural production, and maintaining the safety and smooth operation of railway transportation.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism. They have fiercely exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary economism and "material incentives" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, eliminating the poisonous influence of counter-revolutionary economism. They have insisted on putting proletarian politics in command, resolutely breaking away from some old customs, greatly promoting revolutionary spirit, and significantly enhancing organization and discipline. They have firmly guarded their posts, been loyal to their duties, fearlessly faced difficulties, and bravely shouldered heavy responsibilities. Every sub-bureau, station, and section of the railway has seen the emergence of new people, new deeds, and new spirits that shine with communist ideals. Currently, the broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau are advancing with greater momentum, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting revolution, and vigorously advancing production. They are striving to achieve greater successes to welcome the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛泽东思想统帅铁路运输生产
    上海跌路局革命职工，在解放军支持下，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏活动，铁路运输生产一月胜过一月，全线运输秩序良好
    新华社上海十一日电　上海铁路局广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。目前，上海铁路局全线实现了革命大联合，铁路局和绝大多数分局、站、段都建立了革命委员会。今年以来，铁路运输生产一旬好过一旬，一月胜过一月。四月份平均每天货物装卸量，分别比第一季度提高了百分之二十七和百分之四十一。全线运输秩序良好。
    上海铁路局管辖的线路，连接着我国一些重要的工矿区和工业城市。广大铁路工人充分认识到自己肩负的责任是重大的。他们尽最大的努力，优先运输煤炭、木材、石油、钢铁、粮食等国民经济的重要物资。上海铁路局今年以来经常开出专门列车，配合邻局把淮南、萍乡等地的煤炭，迅速运往全国各地。上海铁路局还每天向邻局和有关部门了解重要物资的生产情况，主动安排和发放列车，以便及时装运。大量工农业产品和人民生活必需的日用工业品，也源源运往全国城乡，有力地支援了各地市场。
      “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。上海铁路局广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅铁路运输生产，保证铁路运输事业沿着毛主席指引的革命轨道前进。现在，奔驰在沪宁、沪杭等线的客车车厢里，办起了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班。列车员和旅客们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。
    广大铁路工人以阶级斗争、路线斗争为纲，狠抓对敌斗争，在粉碎阶级敌人反革命破坏活动的斗争中，保证了铁路运输的正常进行。上海铁路局党内一小撮走资派不甘心自己的灭亡，一方面采取“打进来，拉出去”的反革命手法，阴谋分裂革命群众组织，破坏革命大联合和革命三结合；另一方面阴谋篡夺领导权，并且勾结没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在铁路沿线制造事端，挑起武斗，妄图使铁路瘫痪，运输中断。用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海铁路局广大革命职工，念念不忘阶级斗争，在中国人民解放军的支持下，揪出了这一小撮挑起武斗、破坏革命、破坏铁路运输的走资派和黑手，粉碎了右倾翻案活动，把工农业生产急需的重要物资及时运输出去，保持了铁路运输安全畅通。
    上海铁路局广大革命职工遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统代理人疯狂推行的反革命经济主义和“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，肃清反革命经济主义的流毒。他们坚持用无产阶级政治挂帅，坚决破除了一些陈规旧习，使革命精神大发扬，组织性纪律性显著加强。他们坚守岗位，忠于职守，不怕困难，勇挑重担，各铁路分局、站、段到处出现了闪烁着共产主义精神的新人新事新气象。现在，上海铁路局广大革命职工正在乘胜前进，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以更大的成绩，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
