Anshan Steel's revolutionary workers, cadres, and family members all take to the battlefield. With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the revolutionary criticism is carried out vigorously. Revolutionary criticism promotes production, with each factory and mine seeing production rise steadily, product quality gradually improve, and technological innovation projects continuously emerge.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel Company, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism against the revisionist line of management promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan. The revolutionary and production situation throughout the company is excellent and getting better.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the people. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war." The revolutionary workers and cadres of Anshan Steel Company remember Chairman Mao's great teaching. When they fiercely attack the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, they launch a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. From the mines to the blast furnaces, from the offices to the workshops, from the factory areas to the family quarters, everywhere has become a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary workers and family members all take to the battlefield, each one speaking out and writing, launching a massive wave of revolutionary criticism.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China led by the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive has greatly heightened the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the working class at Anshan Steel. In the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers deeply expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, who frantically promote a whole set of revisionist goods such as "profit-first," "material incentives," and "expert management," attempting to restore capitalism. An old worker from the First Steel Plant said, "The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan promote that set of revisionist management lines, their evil purpose is to attempt to restore capitalism. They use their counter-revolutionary revisionist shackles to suppress our enthusiasm for socialist revolution and socialist construction. We want to operate on 'foreign equipment' and 'foreign technology,' they say, 'you can't touch the Buddha's eyes'; we want to use local methods and old materials for technological revolution, they say, 'chicken feathers can't fly to the sky.' Why do they oppose the proletariat at every turn? Now we see clearly, these guys are traitors, spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated. They represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries; they are our sworn enemies. We must resolutely fight them to the end."

The deep and sustained revolutionary criticism has promoted the revolutionary workers and cadres of Anshan Steel to more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, firmly using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution and production. With deep proletarian feelings of love for Chairman Mao, they study Chairman Mao's works every day before work, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds; during production, they use Mao Zedong Thought to direct their battles; after work, they use Mao Zedong Thought to examine and report their actions to Chairman Mao, turning workshops and teams into large classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and battlefields for criticizing and repudiating oneself and modifying others. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to severely criticize revisionism, using the "Three Articles" as their motto, consciously criticizing and repudiating themselves. Many old workers at the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine, using their own bitter family history to denounce the dark old society, angrily said: We want the proletarian revolutionary government, we resolutely oppose material incentives. The Chinese Khrushchev, this black-hearted wolf, wants to blind us with "bonus-first," make us forget class struggle, and throw away the handle to go back on the old road, that's a pipe dream. They vowed to break private interests and establish public interests, uproot revisionist roots, and defend the proletarian dictatorship's mountains and rivers forever unchanged.

The deep and sustained revolutionary criticism has changed people's spiritual outlook, consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity, promoted revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and driven production. Currently, Anshan Steel's revolution and production both present a great situation. In late April, all direct-subordinate factories and mines of Anshan Steel established revolutionary committees. Production records of each factory and mine are continuously broken, with the output of steel ingots, pig iron, and steel products rising steadily, the quality of various products gradually improving, and technological innovation projects continuously emerging. The revolutionary workers of the Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine broke the old habit of a few people closing the door to do scientific experiments, launching a mass movement, increasing the ore recovery rate from the original 50% to over 90%. The First Steel Plant created a new record for fast steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces since its operation. The revolutionary workers of the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant resolutely overthrew the "crawling" ideology that says large foreign equipment can't be touched, launching technological revolution and innovation, producing cutting-edge products of alloy steel pipe hot rolling success.

In this great situation, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel are determined to carry out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, take the initiative to attack class enemies, thoroughly purge all counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan Steel, and turn Anshan Steel into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    以毛泽东思想为武器  革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈
    革命大批判推动了生产，各厂矿生产节节上升，产品质量逐步提高，技术革新项目不断出现
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司的广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人所推行的修正主义办企业路线展开了深入持久的革命大批判，全公司革命、生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”鞍钢广大革命职工、革命干部牢记毛主席这一伟大教导，在向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人猛烈开火的时候，掀起了一场革命大批判的
  “人民战争”。全公司从矿山到高炉，从机关到车间，从厂区到家属宿舍，到处都摆开了革命大批判的战场。广大革命职工和家属人人上阵，个个口诛笔伐，掀起了声势浩大的群众性的革命大批判高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一英明指示，极大地提高了鞍钢工人阶级阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。在革命大批判中，广大革命职工深刻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人，疯狂推行“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”等一整套修正主义黑货，妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。第一炼钢厂的老工人说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人推行那套修正主义办企业路线，其罪恶目的就是妄图复辟资本主义。他们用他们那套反革命修正主义枷锁，来压制我们工人搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的积极性。我们给“洋设备”、“洋工艺”动“手术”，他们说，“佛爷眼珠碰不得”；我们用土办法、旧材料闹技术革命，他们说，“鸡毛不能飞上天”。为什么他们处处和无产阶级作对？现在咱们算看透了，这些家伙有的是叛徒，有的是特务，有的是混进来的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们代表的是国民党反动派的利益，他们是我们不共戴天的冤家对头。我们一定坚决和他们斗争到底。
    深入持久的革命大批判，促进了鞍钢广大革命职工和革命干部更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚定不移地用毛泽东思想统帅革命，统帅生产。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情，每天上班前学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑；生产中，用毛泽东思想指挥自己战斗；下班后，用毛泽东思想对照检查自己的行动，向毛主席汇报，把车间、班组都办成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，斗私批修的战场。他们以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，狠狠地批修，以“老三篇”为座右铭，自觉地斗私。大石桥镁矿许多老工人用自己苦难的家史控诉黑暗的旧社会时，愤怒地说：我们要的是无产阶级革命政权，坚决反对物质刺激。中国赫鲁晓夫这个黑心狼，想用“奖金挂帅”来迷住咱们的心，要咱们忘记阶级斗争，扔掉印把子走回头路，那是痴心妄想。他们表示，一定要破私立公，挖掉修根，保卫无产阶级专政的江山永不变色。
    深入持久的革命大批判，改变了人的精神面貌，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”，推动了生产。目前，鞍钢的革命和生产都呈现着一片大好形势。四月下旬，鞍钢所有直属厂矿，全部成立了革命委员会。各厂矿的生产纪录不断刷新，钢锭、生铁和钢材的产量节节上升，各种产品的质量逐步提高，技术革新项目不断出现。樱桃园铁矿革命职工大破过去少数人关门搞科学试验的陈规旧习，大搞群众运动，使矿石回收率由原来的百分之五十提高到百分之九十以上。第一炼钢厂创造了开工以来大型平炉快速炼钢的最新纪录。无缝钢管厂革命职工坚决打倒认为大洋设备碰不得的“爬行主义”，大搞技术革命、技术革新，生产出了合金钢管热轧成功的尖端产品。
    在这一派大好形势下，鞍钢广大革命职工决心更加深入持久地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人主动进攻，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在鞍钢散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒，把鞍钢办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
