Near Eagle Nest Mountain in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, we, the families of military personnel, have established a farm. From the establishment of the farm in 1958 to the present, we have fought against nature, against the old ideas of the past, and against the old ways of thinking. Over the past nine years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that these nine years have been about breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness through Mao Zedong Thought; it has been nine years of profound changes in our souls.

	Overcoming Dependence and Stepping Out to Make Revolution

In 1958, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the entire nation launched a great leap forward. We, however, were only engaged in planting vegetables and doing odd jobs near the barracks, or helping soldiers with sewing, mending, washing, and cleaning. We were truly out of step with the great leap forward. The situation demanded action, and we sisters raised a question: "The nation is making a great leap forward, what should we do?" We must not follow the old path of military wives, living a parasitic life dependent on our husbands. We are the families of People's Liberation Army officers, women of the Mao Zedong Thought era, and we must forge our own path. This path is the one pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Unite and participate in production and political activities to improve the economic and political status of women." Thus, in the winter of 1958, following Chairman Mao's instructions, we left the barracks, left the city, and came to the countryside to establish this farm.

	Our struggle against old dependence and stepping out to make revolution was a fierce and repeated battle. When we first established the farm, the newly built mud houses were not yet dry, the ridges inside were not yet leveled, and outside it was snowing heavily. Inside, there was frost on all six walls, and outside there were weeds and rocks everywhere. It was truly neither house nor land. As for food, there was nothing to say! At that time, someone composed a few lines: "Water comes from a basin, frozen vegetables are sour and hard, firewood is gathered by oneself, moldy grain is hard to swallow. If we had known it would be this bitter, why did we come to farm?" Some people wavered and wanted to give up. A few even really left. Just at this critical moment, the division commander sent us a guiding light, organizing us to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and also told us about the 25,000-li Long March and the revolutionary spirit of large-scale production in Yan'an. He inspired us to recall bitterness and sweetness. Most of the sisters were raised in bitter water. In the old society, we were all at the bottom of the bitter sea, each with our own bloody family history. At the party branch's bitterness meeting, Comrade Yuan Guihua was the first to tell everyone about her family's bloody grudge. In the old society, her family was so poor that they could barely make ends meet. When she was six years old, during the Spring Festival, the landlord's firecrackers were loud, and they were feasting and drinking, while her family was cold and silent, unable to open the pot. The whole family of six could not get off the bed due to illness and hunger. Her parents could not bear to see the family starve to death, so they sold her five-year-old younger sister to the landlord's family in exchange for fifty pounds of moldy wheat. When the food was ready and placed on the table, the whole family held their chopsticks and tears, looking at each other, no one could eat. This was not food, this was clearly the blood and flesh of her younger sister! Saying this, everyone's tears could no longer be held back. Some said, "In the old society, we suffered the bitterness of cattle and horses, calling for help to the heavens and the earth, but there was no response; now the knife is in our hands, and we encounter a little temporary difficulty and want to retreat to the small house, relying on our husbands. Isn't this going back to the old path? Chairman Mao leads us to make revolution to go forward, we must not go back!" Others said, "In the old society, we suffered for the landlords, now we suffer for the revolution!" Everyone spoke more and more enthusiastically. The youngest, Peng Fengfu, said, "Right! If we do not overcome old ideas, we cannot be the masters of the new era. We must take root in Eagle Nest Mountain and bury old ideas completely!"

	In front of our farm, there is a seventy-acre low-lying area called "Frog Pond" by the locals, filled with waist-deep water grass. People said that nothing could grow there. But we dug a bit and found good black soil underneath, so we decided to turn it into farmland. We proposed to turn the transformation of "Frog Pond" into a battlefield for overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, letting Chairman Mao's spirit of hard struggle take root in our minds.

	We started by pulling out the grass. The grass in the water was thick and deep, and two people together would shout slogans and pull it out by the roots. Some people initially wore gloves and water shoes, but later they all threw them away and worked with bare hands and feet. Even if they cut their hands, they did not care and continued until the grass was all pulled out. The stones and tree roots underneath, some of us used picks to dig, others used hammers to smash, little by little we cleared them out. Our hands were full of blisters, but no one complained. To prevent flooding, we also built two flood dikes along the foot of Eagle Nest Mountain, totaling more than a thousand meters long. We also dug thirteen drainage ditches in the pond, each three or four feet deep, totaling four hundred and fifty meters long. These were all done in the rain, because on sunny days we still had to tend to the good land, and in the rain we could see where the water flowed to dig the ditches. We worked with rain on our heads and mud on our feet, shoveling one by one. The mud was very sticky, sometimes shoveling one load and having to pull out the foot once. Like this, everyone worked while singing, the mood was high. The surrounding people saw and said, "These families of the PLA are as capable as the PLA soldiers themselves, we must learn from them." But some also said, "Seeking trouble for no reason. Can this land produce grain? Pure nonsense." At first, we felt a bit unhappy hearing this, but later we thought, we are doing the revolution, without hard struggle, we cannot walk the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. Thinking this way, we became even more determined to continue. After three years of hard work, we reclaimed sixty-eight acres of good land. In the following years, this "Frog Pond," which people thought nothing could grow in, produced tens of millions of pounds of grain and vegetables for the state. But our spiritual gains were even greater than our material gains. We used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform our lazy, indulgent, and dirty thoughts. The surrounding people also changed their views of us, saying we are the "female guerrillas of Eagle Nest Mountain."

	Our farm has been advancing through continuous ideological transformation, not only tempering and transforming the older family members but also cultivating and transforming the new family members, making a new generation grow up in the farm. Take Liu Jinrong, who came to the farm in 1964, for example. She was a city girl, full of affectation when she first came to the farm. The sisters called her the "foreign student." When she first came, she was dissatisfied with everything, saying the well water was disgusting, afraid to get her hands dirty working in the fields, saying farming was undignified. Through the sisters' help, she studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," recalled family history, told the farm's history, and visited "Frog Pond," igniting a revolutionary fire in her soul to overcome old ideas. She thought, "These sisters, dressed in coarse cloth, doing heavy work, working hard all day, why? Isn't it for socialist construction! And I, thinking only of eating well and dressing well. Where do eating and dressing come from? Aren't they all obtained through the hard work of the working people and these sisters? Relying on one's husband to eat and dress, isn't this becoming the wife of an official in the old society? How shameful!" She brought this question to her mind and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" more than twenty times, her ideological awareness greatly improved. From then on, she changed from wearing fine clothes to coarse cloth, rolling in the mud, crawling in the water, getting dirty in the sun, and muddy in the rain, working with everyone. Through studying Chairman Mao's works and participating in actual labor, she understood that suffering for the revolution is happiness, laboring for the revolution is the future, serving the people for a lifetime is a happy and glorious life. Once, she and the car driver, Old Man Sun, went to the city to process rice. They left at four in the morning without eating, only bringing two buns. She found that Old Man Sun did not bring any food, so she gave her buns to Old Man Sun to eat, enduring hunger herself. It got dark, and the rice was not yet processed. Old Man Sun told her to go home and rest. Liu Jinrong, however, let Old Man Sun take the processed rice back and stayed behind. At that time, the weather was quite cold. Little Liu thought of the story of the Long March and remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people," enduring hunger and cold, spending the night by the rice. When Old Man Sun brought her steamed buns the next day, Little Liu had not eaten for thirty-one hours.

	We overcame old dependence and stepped out of small families to walk the path of revolutionization pointed out by Chairman Mao. This is the fundamental path for women to achieve complete liberation politically, economically, and ideologically. However, the Chinese Khrushchev hates and fears our women's complete liberation. He maliciously says, "Either decide to take care of the children, do not think of any great future." "Since you are married, you are someone's wife, you should be a good wife, ... give birth to children and be a good mother." The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use these black words to lure us onto his capitalist restoration black road, pushing us back into the abyss of the old society. We do not agree with this, not even a little.

	Sweeping Away the Sense of Incompetence, Daring to Shoulder Half the Sky

	Chairman Mao said, "The women of China are a great human resource. This resource must be developed to struggle for the construction of a great socialist country." Chairman Mao's great instructions have given us great encouragement, great motivation, and great strength. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make him proud.

	Over the past nine years, the greatest ideological obstacle we have encountered in our progress is the sense of incompetence, which restrains our revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do. Especially for us who are married and have children, we think we are not good at this or that, only good at cooking, taking care of children, and managing the household, and have nothing to do with the great cause of socialist construction, national affairs, or world affairs. Others say we are "horses that cannot go to battle." To make Chairman Mao proud, we must break through here, using Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away the sense of incompetence in the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, and firmly establish the pride of being the masters of the new era.

	Unlike the production brigades of people's communes and other state farms, all the labor force in our farm is women with children. At the beginning, some sisters saw this situation and felt their hearts sink. They muttered, "There are not even any men, how can we women accomplish anything?" The party branch seized this active thought, organizing the sisters to first study Chairman Mao's instructions on women's work, and also study the advanced deeds of daring to think and dare to do of the first female train driver, the first female tractor driver, and the first female pilot in our country. They also visited a women's coal mining team near a coal mine. Through the study, everyone repeatedly understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings: "If China's half of the women do not awaken, China's war of resistance will not be victorious." "The day all women in the country rise up is the day of China's revolutionary victory." Everyone recalled the revolutionary actions and spirit of the democratic revolution period, when the broad masses of women sent their husbands and sons to the battlefield, actively supported the frontline, and organized to fight landlords, divide land, and so on. The more we studied, the broader our horizons became, the brighter our hearts became, and the more we gained courage. On this basis, everyone voluntarily criticized the sense of incompetence, recognizing it as a reflection of the old society's "male superiority" ideology, a product of thousands of years of exploitation, and a brand burned into women's minds. With increased awareness, we gained the courage to practice. In practice, everyone further saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the great power of women who mastered Mao Zedong Thought, further enhancing our fighting spirit.

	High buildings start from the ground, and sweeping away the sense of incompetence also starts from the present. The brick beds we sleep on are made of un-dried mud bricks, and after sleeping on them for a while, they either collapse or crack. Some say: Go to the production brigade and find a mason to fix it! Comrade Yuan Guihua heard this and said: "Find a mason for what? Can't we fix it ourselves?" Comrade Yuan is the boldest, most daring, and most revolutionary among us sisters, with a spirit of "trying to compete with the heavens." She said, "This one finds a person, that one finds a person, still does not believe in oneself, does not see the great power of women, this ideological obstacle must be eliminated, when can we liberate ourselves? We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of 'doing and learning, doing is learning' and use actual actions to fight against the old ideas that look down on women." She told the sisters, "I will fix it, no need to find anyone!" In fact, she did not know how to fix it. To master the technique of fixing beds, she tore down and rebuilt her own bed seven or eight times, finally learning how to do it. She then went from house to house to fix them. As long as someone's bed was not burning well, she would go over immediately. Later, she also learned to build firewalls and fix stoves, becoming our local expert. As for slaughtering pigs, we also advocated finding someone to do it because at home, even killing a chicken was scary, let alone a 200-pound fat pig! But Comrade Yuan said, "What's so scary about slaughtering a pig? In battle, we still have to kill American devils!" Seeing her determination, no one found anyone. A few strong sisters caught the pig and tied it up, and Comrade Yuan, with great courage, went up and stabbed it with a knife. Unfortunately, she did not hit the vital spot, and when she pulled out the knife, the pig was still squealing. She thought, "Even a pig cannot be killed, how can one stand tall and strong?" She went up and stabbed it again, and the pig did not move anymore. Comrade Yuan's actions greatly boosted our women's morale, making us realize that regardless of age or gender, whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought has the courage to fear neither heaven nor earth.

	From then on, we no longer mentioned finding someone to do the work! We do everything ourselves. Take driving a cart, for example. Although many of us are from the countryside, no one had ever held a whip at home. We initially asked for help, but later decided to do it ourselves. At first, no one dared to get close to the livestock, shouting from a distance with a soft voice, but the livestock did not listen. I remember once when we were plowing the field, as soon as the horse was harnessed and let go, it ran away. The sisters shouted anxiously, "Stop! Stop!" It took a lot of effort to catch it. But Comrade Yuan was not convinced. She said, "We are now learning to do farm work and growing revolutionary spirit." Under her influence, we "resolved to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Finally, we learned to drive a cart. Once, Comrade Yuan and a few sisters drove a cart to Jiutai City to fetch things. The city people saw women driving a cart and came to watch. Comrade Yuan was not bothered at all, standing tall with her whip. Some people said, "Women driving a cart, rare to see!" Comrade Yuan swung her whip, "Giddyup! Giddyup!" She said, "These two whips are a show of strength to those old ideas that look down on women! To announce that we women are the masters who control the wheels of the times!" Because we often drive carts to the city, over time, people no longer found it strange. They would see us and know it was the family farm. Once, the cart had a problem in the city, and the people voluntarily helped us fix it. An old man said, "Chairman Mao's education is good, the families of the PLA are just like us common people." Every time we heard such praise, our hearts were warm. On one hand, we felt it was the people encouraging us, and on the other hand, we truly felt that it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that inspired us to break with old traditions, helping us smash all kinds of spiritual shackles. Our actions in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions are a powerful criticism of old ideas and old notions, showing the spirit of the new Chinese women who have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    “鹰窝山下的女八路”
    沈阳部队某师家属农场
    在吉林省九台县附近的鹰窝山下，我们军人家属在这里办起了一个农场。从一九五八年办场到现在，与天斗，与地斗，与人的旧思想斗，已经九年多了。回顾建场九年来走过的道路，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来所受到的锻炼教育，我们深深体会到：这是靠毛泽东思想破私立公的九年；是我们灵魂深处翻天覆地变化的九年。
    打掉依赖思想，走出小家庭闹革命
    一九五八年，全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大跃进高潮。我们呢，只是在营房附近种点菜，搞点副业，或者帮助战士缝缝补补，洗洗涮涮，真是和大跃进的步伐合不上拍。形势逼人，姐妹们提出了一个问题：“全国大跃进，我们怎么办？”说啥也不能走旧军队官太太的路，靠着丈夫过不劳而食的寄生生活。我们是人民军队干部的家属，是毛泽东思想时代的妇女，一定要走我们自己的路。这条路，就是毛主席指出的：“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位。”就这样，一九五八年冬天，我们遵照毛主席的指示，走出营房，离开城市，来到农村，办起了这座农场。
    我们造旧的依赖思想的反，杀出屋里闹革命，是经过反复激烈的斗争的。我们建场的时候，刚垒起来的土房还没有干，屋里的垄沟还没来得及平，外面下着鹅毛大雪，室内六面冰霜，院里到处是蒿草乱石。简直屋不象屋，地不象地。吃的更不用提啦！当时有人编了几句顺口溜说：“吃水靠盆端，冻菜硬又酸，烧柴自己捡，霉粮更难咽，早知这般苦，何必来种田！”有些人动摇了，想打退堂鼓，有个别人真的走了。正在这个节骨眼上，师首长给我们送来了指路明灯，组织我们学习了《愚公移山》，还给我们讲了两万五千里长征和南泥湾大生产的传统革命精神，并启发我们忆苦思甜。姐妹们绝大多数是在苦水里泡大的，在吃人的旧社会，都被压在苦海的最底层，都有自己的一部血泪家史。在党支部组织的忆苦大会上，袁桂香大姐首先向大家诉说了她一家的血泪仇。在旧社会，她家穷得叮当响，她六岁那年，过春节，地主家鞭炮放得啪啪响，大吃大喝，花天酒地，她家冷冷清清揭不开锅，全家六口人，连病带饿下不了炕。她爹妈怎能忍心看着一家这样活活饿死呢，含着泪把她五岁的小妹妹卖给了地主家，换回五十斤发霉的大麦。把饭做好端到桌上，一家人拿着筷子含着泪，你瞅瞅我，我瞅瞅你，谁也吃不下去。这哪是饭啊，这不明明是妹妹的血和肉吗？！说到这儿，大家的眼泪再也忍不住了。有的说：“旧社会咱们受尽牛马苦，叫天天不应，入地地无门，无边苦海，到哪儿都得喝苦水；现在刀把子在咱们手里了，眼前碰到一点暂时困难就想打退堂鼓，想退到小屋里，靠丈夫，这不是走回头路吗？毛主席领导咱们闹革命是让咱们向前闯，我们绝不能走回头路。”有的说：“旧社会我们吃苦是养地主，现在我们吃苦是为革命！”大家越说越起劲，年纪最小的彭凤福说：“对！造不了旧思想的反，就当不了新时代的主人，我们要在鹰窝山下扎根，把旧思想彻底埋葬！”
    我们农场前面有一片七十来亩的洼地，群众叫“蛤蟆塘”，长的全是齐腰深的水草，人们说这儿种啥瞎啥。可是我们挖一挖看，里面是黑油油的好土，就决心把它改成地种。我们提出把改造“蛤蟆塘”作为破私立公的战场，让毛主席艰苦奋斗的思想在头脑里扎下根子。
    开始是拔草。草在水里长得又粗又深，两人一块，喊着号子连根往外拔。有的人开始带手套，穿水鞋，后来干脆都扔掉了，光手、光脚干。划出了血口子也不管，一直拔完。下面的石头、树根，我们有的用镐刨，有的用锤砸，一点一点地清出来，手上打满了血泡，谁也不叫苦。为了防内涝，我们还沿着鹰窝山脚，修了两条防洪堤，一共一千多米长。又在塘里挖了十三道排水沟，每条三、四尺深，一共四百五十米长。这些都是雨天干的，因为晴天还要侍弄好地，雨天可以看出水往哪流，好顺水势挖沟。我们头上顶着雨，脚下踩着泥，一锹一锹地往下挖。泥巴粘得很，有时挖一锹还得拔一次脚。就这样大家一边干，还一边唱歌，情绪很高。周围群众看了说：“这些解放军的家属，和解放军一样能干，我们得好好向她们学习呀。”但也有个别人说：“有福不享，找罪受。这地能打粮食？纯粹胡闹。”开始听了，心里有点不痛快，后来一想，我们干的是革命，没有艰苦奋斗，就走不上毛主席指引的路，这样一想，更坚定了干下去的决心。经过三年的艰苦努力，我们开出了六十八亩好地。几年来，这块被人们认为种啥瞎啥的“蛤蟆塘”，为国家生产了几十万斤粮食、蔬菜。可是我们思想上的收获比物质上的收获更大。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想改造了我们好逸恶劳、贪图享受的脏思想。附近的群众也改变了对我们的看法，说我们是“鹰窝山下的女八路”。
    我们农场是在不断改造思想中前进的，不但锻炼改造了老一些的家属，也培养改造了新来的家属，使一代新人在农场成长起来。就拿一九六四年进场的刘金红说吧，她是个城市知识青年，初来农场的时候，浑身娇气。姐妹们管她叫“洋学生”。她刚来时，处处不顺心，吃井水说恶心，下地干活怕沾上土，说干庄稼活没出息。经过姐妹们帮助她学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和《为人民服务》，一起忆家史，讲场史，领她到“蛤蟆塘”参观，给她点起了一把反旧思想的革命烈火，触动了她的灵魂。她想：“这些大姐，身穿粗布，干重活，一天到晚辛辛苦苦，为什么呀！还不是为了社会主义建设！我呢，心里想的是吃好、穿好。吃穿是哪来的？不都是劳动人民和这些姐妹们艰苦劳动得来的吗？自己不劳动，靠丈夫讲吃穿，这不是变成了旧社会的官太太了吗？过那样的生活多可耻呀！”她就带着这个思想问题，前后学习了二十次《为人民服务》，思想觉悟有很大提高。从此，她脱下料子服，换上粗布衣，泥里滚，水里爬，晴天一身土，雨天一身泥，和大家一样参加劳动。通过学习毛主席著作和实际参加劳动，她懂得了为革命吃苦就是幸福，为革命劳动就是前途，为人民服务的一生，就是幸福的一生，光荣的一生。有一次，她和车老板孙大叔到街里加工稻米，早上四点钟没吃饭就去了，只带两个饼子。她发现孙大叔没带吃的，就把饼子送给孙大叔吃了，自己宁可挨着饿。天黑了，稻米还没有磨完，孙大叔叫她回家休息。刘金红却让孙大叔把磨好的稻米送回去，她自己留下来。当时天气比较冷，小刘想起红军长征的故事，记着毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，忍着饥饿寒冷，在稻米旁过了一夜。等孙大叔第二天给她带去馒头时，小刘已经三十一小时没吃东西了。
    我们造了旧的依赖思想的反，从小家庭走出来，走上了毛主席指引的革命化道路，这是我们妇女从政治上、经济上和思想上彻底翻身解放的根本道路。可是中国赫鲁晓夫对我们妇女的彻底翻身解放，恨得要命，怕得要死。他胡说什么：“要么下决心带孩子，不要再想什么远大前途。”“你既然结婚，就是做了人家的老婆，你就要做个好老婆，……生孩子就要做好母亲。”中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用这些黑话把我们引诱到他复辟资本主义的黑路上去，重新把我们推进旧社会的万丈深渊，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
  横扫无所作为的自卑感，敢于顶起半边天
    毛主席说：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”毛主席的伟大指示，给了我们极大的鼓舞、极大的鞭策和极大的力量。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们就要为他老人家争气。
    九年来，我们在前进中遇到最大的思想障碍，就是无所作为的自卑感，它束缚着我们妇女敢想、敢干的革命精神。特别是我们这些结了婚、生了孩子的人，认为自己这也不行，那也不行，只有围着锅台转，看孩子、管家务，那管得了社会主义建设大事、国家大事、世界大事。人家说我们是“骒马上不了阵”。我们要为毛主席争气，就得从这里突破，用毛泽东思想在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的三大革命实践中，横扫无所作为的自卑感，大立做新时代主人的自豪感。
    同人民公社生产队和其它国营农场都不一样，我们这个农场的劳动力全部是拖儿带女的妇女。开始，有的姐妹看到这个情况，心里凉了半截，她们直嘀咕：“连个老爷们都没有，就凭我们这些老娘们能干出个啥来？”党支部抓住这个活思想，组织姐妹们首先学习了毛主席关于妇女工作的指示，又学习了我国第一个女火车司机、第一个女拖拉机手、第一个女飞行员敢想敢干的先进事迹，还参观了附近煤矿的一个妇女采煤队。学习中，大家反复领会了毛主席教导：“假如中国没有占半数的妇女的觉醒，中国抗战是不会胜利的。”“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时”的伟大意义，回忆了民主革命时期，广大妇女送郎送子上战场，积极支援前线和组织起来打土豪、斗地主、分田地的革命行动和革命精神。大家越学眼界越开阔，越学心里越亮堂，越学越长志气。在这个基础上大家自觉地批判了自卑感，认识到自卑感是旧社会“男尊女卑”思想的反映，是几千年剥削制度的产物，是打在妇女头脑里的烙印。认识提高了，就有了实践的勇气。在实践中大家进一步看到了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，看到了掌握了毛泽东思想的妇女的伟大力量，更提高了斗争的勇气。
    万丈高楼要从平地起，扫除自卑感也得从眼前事干起。我们睡的火炕是用没有干的土坯垒起来的，睡上不久，就塌的塌，裂的裂，一家烧火，三家冒烟。有人说：到生产队请个泥瓦匠来修修吧！袁桂香大姐听了说：“请泥瓦匠干啥，我们自己不会修吗？”袁大姐是我们姐妹中最敢想、敢干、敢造反的闯将，她有一股子“欲与天公试比高”的志气。她说：“这也请人，那也请人，还是不相信自己，看不到我们妇女的伟大力量，这种思想障碍不清除，我们什么时候能自己解放自己呢？我们就是要按照毛主席‘干起来再学习，干就是学习’的教导去做，我们就是要用实际行动，同那些轻视妇女的旧观念作斗争。”她向姐妹们说：“我修，不用找人！”其实她也不会，为了掌握修炕的技术，她把自己家的炕拆了垒，垒了拆，反复了七、八次，终于学会了。她就挨家挨户地修，只要谁家的炕不好烧，喊一声，她马上就到。后来，她把打火墙、修锅台也都学会了，成了我们的土专家。还有杀猪，当时我们也主张找人，因为在家时杀个鸡都不敢看，一、二百斤的大肥猪谁敢杀呀！可是袁大姐说：“杀猪有啥了不起的，打起仗来还要杀美国鬼子呢！”大家看她决心这么大，也就没有找人。几个身强力壮的姐妹，把猪抓起来捆好了，袁桂香鼓起勇气，上去一刀，可惜没捅到要害，刀拔出来以后，猪还在嗷嗷叫。她想：“连口猪都杀不死还能顶天立地？”上去又是一刀，猪再也不动弹了。袁大姐的行动大长了我们妇女的志气，使我们认识到不管男女老少，谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就有天不怕，地不怕的胆量。
    从此以后，我们再不提干活找别人啦！一切自己动手。就拿赶车来说吧，我们虽然农村出身的不少，可是在家谁也没有拿过马鞭子，原来求过人，后来还是决心自己干。开始都不敢接近牲口，离挺远喊一句，细声细气，牲口也不听使唤。记得有一次趟地，把马刚套上，一松手就跑了，姐妹们急得直喊：“站下！站下！”费了挺大劲才抓回来。但是袁桂香大姐不服气，她说：“我们现在学的是干庄稼活，长的是革命志气。”在她的带动下，我们“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”终于学会了赶车。有一次袁桂香大姐和几个姐妹赶着车到九台城里拉东西。街上群众一看妇女赶车都来看热闹。袁桂香一点也不在乎，挺着胸，扬着鞭子走在前边。有的人说：“老娘们赶车，真少见！”袁桂香把大鞭一甩，“嘎！”“嘎！”两声。她说：“我这两鞭子是向那些轻视妇女的旧观念示威！向他们宣告我们妇女是掌握时代车轮的主人啦！”由于我们经常赶车到街里去，时间长了，人们也不奇怪了，他们一看见就知道是家属农场的。有一次车在街里出了毛病，群众主动帮我们修理。一位老大爷说：“毛主席教育的好，人民军队的家属也跟咱老百姓一个样。”每当我们听到这样的称赞，心里总是热呼呼的，一方面觉得是群众对我们的鼓励，同时也真正体会到：是战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着我们与旧传统观念作彻底的决裂，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想帮助我们砸碎了种种精神枷锁。我们按毛主席指示办事的行动，就是对旧思想、旧观念的有力批判，显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国妇女的主人翁的精神面貌。
