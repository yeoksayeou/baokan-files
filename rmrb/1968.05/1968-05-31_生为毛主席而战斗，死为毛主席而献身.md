In the midst of the nationwide celebration of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order, posthumously awarding Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This is a major event in the political life of the nation and the greatest concern, encouragement, and exhortation from our great leader Chairman Mao to the military and civilian personnel across the country!

After reading the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He, our hearts are filled with emotions that cannot be calmed for a long time. With an infinitely loyal heart to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and with the noble heroic deeds of a proletarian revolutionary fighter, he has composed another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought! "Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!" All the comrades in our Fourth Platoon resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, and are determined to learn from the brilliant example personally set by him, to learn, learn again, and learn even more!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; there is no room for compromise on the line issue." Since joining the revolution, Comrade Men He has been steadfast for twenty years, always firmly standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and engaging in a tenacious struggle against the class enemy. Comrade Men He is able to do this because he has only Chairman Mao in his heart. For every strategic deployment and every great instruction from Chairman Mao, he believes without doubt, studies diligently, understands deeply, and follows them to the letter. He has done what it means to "always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always keep up with Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao." His class struggle consciousness is the strongest, his awareness of line struggle is the highest, he sees the class enemy the clearest, fights the hardest, and strikes the fiercest. He has fulfilled his iron-clad vow: "Always stand guard, keep watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" His life is one of resolutely executing and bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Comrade Men He and our good platoon leader Li Wenzhong are the same: "Think of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, exert effort for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sweat for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and shed blood to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line"; "Beheading is nothing, as long as the cause is true, defend Chairman Mao, and even death is worthwhile." This is the soul of an advanced fighter in the continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the strongest note of our heroic age, the highest peak of the thought revolutionization of our revolutionary fighters, and the focal point of our learning from Comrade Men He.

Learning from Men He, comparing ourselves, touching our souls, and finding our gaps, we have a more correct understanding of what we have done in the past and a higher standard for what we need to do in the future. Our platoon, in carrying out the task of supporting the left, in the battle of rescuing Red Guards in the Ganjiang River, has been tested and tempered. However, later, some comrades showed a "good enough" attitude, thinking that they had passed the test in the critical moment of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and that there would be no big problems in the future. Comrade Men He's vow to "always stand guard, keep watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" deeply touched the souls of each of us. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our achievements are obviously and undeniably great. However, at the same time, our work still has shortcomings. Whoever only sees the achievements and not the shortcomings will not be able to fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks." This makes us deeply realize that the "good enough" mentality is a stumbling block for us to keep moving forward along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a manifestation of personal honor and selfishness, and a disloyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Every achievement, every progress, and every individual's growth in the past are the results of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and achieved under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the face of honor, we have only Chairman Mao in our hearts and must not have the word "I" or any trace of the "good enough" mentality. If there is the word "I," it is disloyalty to Chairman Mao; if there is the "good enough" mentality, it is the beginning of deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the struggle between the two lines, it will become a sentinel who has lost vigilance and a soldier who lacks fighting spirit.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's latest instruction, we tighten the string of the struggle between the two lines in our minds, earnestly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, support agriculture in the countryside, and earnestly help the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We study Chairman Mao's great theory on class struggle, launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and at the same time, in conjunction with the actual class struggle in this locality, carry out a revolutionary criticism and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi. In this way, we have effectively struck the enemy, deeply educated the masses, and promoted the revolution and production in the countryside to a great situation.

Today, as we learn from the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He and use him as a mirror to examine ourselves, we deeply feel that there is still a great distance to go. We are determined, like Comrade Men He, to study Chairman Mao's works with insatiable hunger, to learn and use them in the struggle between the lines, to carry forward the spirit of conscious revolution, to break the bourgeois "private" and establish the proletarian "public," to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to achieve new victories in the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    生为毛主席而战斗，死为毛主席而献身
    人民解放军某部“支左爱民模范排”
    在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，由中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，这是全国人民政治生活中的一件大事，是伟大领袖毛主席对全国军民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策！
    我们读完门合同志的英雄事迹，心情久久不能平静。他以无限忠于毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心，以无产阶级革命战士崇高的英雄行为，谱写了又一曲毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌！“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”我们四排全体同志，最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，决心向他老人家为我们亲自树立的光辉榜样学习，学习，再学习！
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”门合同志参加革命以来，二十年如一日，始终坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同阶级敌人进行了英勇顽强的斗争。门合同志所以能这样做，就是因为他心中只有毛主席，对毛主席每个战略部署，每条伟大指示，都坚信不疑，认真学习，深刻领会，句句照办。他做到了“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”。他的阶级斗争观念最强，路线斗争觉悟最高，对阶级敌人看得最清，打得最准，斗得最狠。他实现了自己的钢铁誓言：“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！”他的一生就是坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的一生。门合同志和我们的好排长李文忠一样，做到了：“心往毛主席革命路线上想，劲往毛主席革命路线上使，汗往毛主席革命路线上淌，血往保卫毛主席革命路线上流”；“砍头不要紧，只要主义真，保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”这是无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的先进战士的灵魂，是我们英雄时代的最强音，是我们革命战士思想革命化的最高峰，是我们向门合同志学习的重点的重点，根本的根本。
    学门合，比自己，触灵魂，找差距，使我们对过去所做的一切有了更正确的认识，对未来要做的事情，有了更高的标准。我们排在执行支左任务中，在赣江抢救红卫兵的战斗中，经受了考验，得到了锻炼。可是后来，有个别同志流露出一种“差不多”的情绪，认为在捍卫毛主席革命路线的生死关头经得住考验了，以后就不会出什么大问题了。门合同志“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”的誓言，狠狠地触动了我们每个人的灵魂。毛主席教导我们：“我们的工作成绩是很显然的，毫无疑义的。但是同时，我们的工作中依然存在着缺点。谁要是只看见成绩一面，不看见缺点一面，谁也就不会很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”这使我们深刻认识到，“差不多”的思想是我们沿着毛主席革命路线不断前进的绊脚石，是个人荣誉的私心在作怪，是对毛主席革命路线的不忠。过去所取得的每一点成绩，每一点进步，每个人的成长，都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，都是在毛主席革命路线指引下取得的。在荣誉面前，我们心中只有毛主席，决不能有“我”字，决不能有一丝一毫“差不多”的想法。如果有“我”字，就是对毛主席的不忠，有“差不多”的思想，就是脱离毛主席革命路线的开始，在两条路线斗争中，就会成为一个失掉警惕性的岗哨，缺乏战斗力的士兵。
    毛主席最近指示我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    在毛主席这个最新指示的光辉照耀下，我们在头脑里把两条路线斗争的弦，绷得紧紧的，认真执行毛主席的革命路线，在农村支农，认真帮助贫下中农办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的伟大理论，向阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻，同时结合本地阶级斗争的实际开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西代理人的反革命修正主义路线。这样，就有力地打击了敌人，深刻地教育了群众，促进农村的革命、生产出现了大好形势。
    今天我们学习门合同志的英雄事迹，以他为镜子对照自己，深深感到还相差很远很远。我们决心象门合同志那样，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，在路线斗争中学，在路线斗争中用，发扬自觉的革命精神，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功！
