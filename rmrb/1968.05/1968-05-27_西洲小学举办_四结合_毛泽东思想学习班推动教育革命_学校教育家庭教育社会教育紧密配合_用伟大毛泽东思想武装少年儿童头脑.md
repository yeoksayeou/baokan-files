Xizhou Primary School Holds "Four-in-One" Mao Zedong Thought Study Class to Promote Educational Revolution
School Education, Family Education, and Social Education Work in Close Coordination to Arm the Minds of Young Pioneers with Great Mao Zedong Thought

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou -- With the support and assistance of the brigade leadership, Xizhou Primary School in Xintang Commune, Zengcheng County, Guangdong, has organized a "four-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought study class, attended by revolutionary teachers and students, student parents, brigade and production team cadres. Together, they have studied the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and his instructions on the proletarian educational revolution, deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, and powerfully promoted the proletarian educational revolution in this school.

Since the resumption of classes and the start of the revolution, Xizhou Primary School has held two sessions of such "four-in-one" study classes, with over 300 participants. In the study classes, they linked the class struggle in the countryside with their personal thoughts, deeply studied and understood Chairman Mao's great thoughts on the proletarian educational revolution, and conducted a powerful critique of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Through study and criticism, everyone gained a deeper understanding that the educational revolution is an important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a national affair concerning the cultivation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and ensuring that our proletarian iron mountains and rivers will never change color. After raising their awareness, student parents, grassroots cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students in the school all regarded promoting the educational revolution as their honorable duty, greatly enhancing their initiative in carrying out the educational revolution.

In the "four-in-one" study classes, everyone seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian educational thoughts and his latest instructions on the proletarian educational revolution. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they exposed the true colors of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, clarified the essence of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the educational front, and combined the struggle against self with the struggle against revisionism. They swept away the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Throughout the process of struggling against self and criticizing revisionism, they always emphasized class education through reminiscences and comparisons. Parents of students from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds recalled the bitter lives of being exploited in the old society, enthusiastically discussed their experiences of standing up and being liberated under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They also expressed their deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, who plotted to drag the working people back into the abyss of suffering. Everyone said: Chairman Mao not only led our generation to stand up, but also cares for our descendants' well-being every moment. Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao; the Zhujiang River is long, but not as long as Chairman Mao's kindness. We must follow Chairman Mao's words and contribute our strength to the proletarian educational revolution.

The deep proletarian feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao and their concern for the proletarian educational revolution greatly inspired and encouraged the revolutionary teachers in the school. They expressed their determination to be loyal to Chairman Mao, dare to face difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and achieve new successes in the educational revolution. Brigade and production team cadres who participated in the study classes also further understood the profound significance of the proletarian educational revolution and expressed their determination to better care for this matter. They also decided that the leadership at all levels would further assist the school in carrying out this revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "People's social existence determines their thoughts. Once the correct thoughts representing the advanced class are grasped by the masses, they will become a material force to transform society and the world." Through the organization of "four-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Xizhou Primary School has launched a new high tide of mass educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students have written over 300 critical articles, held class, combined class, and school-wide criticism meetings, and compiled new political and cultural textbooks with Mao Zedong Thought as the basic content. They also invited poor and lower-middle peasant parents to teach classes on class struggle and production knowledge. Some revolutionary criticism and writing classes were taught by the students themselves. Teachers have prepared teaching reform plans, actively sought the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants, invited poor and lower-middle peasant parents to attend classes, and provided criticisms and suggestions. Many poor and lower-middle peasant parents often told their children about family history and village history, conducted class education, and actively supervised their children to participate in collective activities organized by the school. Some parents said: It is easy to plant the seed of selfishness in children's minds at home, but participating in collective labor will plant the seed of public spirit in children's minds, which is beneficial for cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause who are dedicated to the public. Many parents paid great attention to strengthening their own ideological transformation, using their loyal actions to Chairman Mao to educate their descendants, and actively educating others' children. When there were good deeds among the children, both inside and outside the school praised them; when there were bad tendencies among the children, both inside and outside the school managed them. In this way, school education, family education, and social education were more closely coordinated, and the proletarian educational revolution was truly implemented in cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a hundred-year plan.

Currently, the brigade and its subordinate production teams' revolutionary cadres pay great attention to promoting the educational revolution. They designate specific personnel to handle the educational revolution, frequently provide specific guidance and assistance to the school. In more than a month, the brigade leadership has held two expanded meetings to study how to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guideline to handle the ideological and political work of young people, and help the school carry out the educational revolution.

Through the extensive organization of "four-in-one" study classes, this brigade has fundamentally changed the past phenomenon of "parents managing clothing and food, teachers managing books and literacy, and brigade cadres managing the allocation of funds to solve school difficulties." Everyone has become more conscious of handling students' ideological and political work, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of young pioneers.

The educational revolution of Xizhou Primary School has been praised by the higher-level revolutionary committee, which has helped them summarize the specific experiences of organizing "four-in-one" study classes: First, the brigade leadership pays attention and actively strengthens leadership; second, the study time and content should be suitable for rural areas and poor and lower-middle peasants, with each session lasting three to five days, the content being concise and focused, mainly studying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and selected excerpts from Chairman Mao's speeches on the proletarian educational revolution, studying them deeply and thoroughly, and conducting targeted criticisms of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, studying and criticizing simultaneously; third, class education through reminiscences and comparisons should be emphasized, arousing boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao; fourth, it should be combined with the overall revolutionary criticism in the countryside, linking China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside and promote the revisionist educational line to conduct criticism.

Currently, these experiences have begun to be promoted in the county and the district.

    西洲小学举办“四结合”毛泽东思想学习班推动教育革命
    学校教育家庭教育社会教育紧密配合  用伟大毛泽东思想武装少年儿童头脑
    新华社广州电　广东增城县新塘公社西洲小学，在大队领导班子的支持和帮助下，举办有革命师生、学生家长、大队和生产队干部参加的“四结合”的毛泽东思想学习班，共同学习伟大领袖毛主席的“五·七”指示和毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的指示，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，有力地推动了这个学校的无产阶级教育革命。
    西洲小学复课闹革命以来，连续举办了两期这样的“四结合”学习班，有三百多人参加学习。在学习班里，他们联系农村的阶级斗争实际和个人的思想实际，深入学习、领会毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的伟大思想，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，进行了有力的批判。经过学习和批判，大家更深刻地认识到，教育革命是无产阶级文化大革命的重要组成部分，是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，保证我国无产阶级铁打江山永不变色的国家大事。大家的认识提高以后，学生家长、基层干部和学校的革命师生一起，都把搞好教育革命当成是自己的光荣任务，大大增强了进行教育革命的自觉性。
    大家在“四结合”的学习班里，认真学习伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级教育思想和关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，揭开中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的画皮，弄清教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实质，同时把斗私和批修结合起来，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒。在斗私批修过程中，又始终贯穿着忆苦思甜、回忆对比的阶级教育这根红线。贫下中农出身的学生家长，回忆了旧社会当牛做马的惨痛生活，畅谈在毛主席英明领导下获得翻身解放的经历，对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加无限热爱，对阴谋把劳动人民拉回痛苦深渊的中国赫鲁晓夫更加无比仇恨。大家激动地说：毛主席不但领导我们这一代人翻了身，还为我们子孙万代不走回头路时时刻刻在操心。爹亲娘亲，比不上毛主席亲；珠江水长，比不上毛主席的恩情长。我们一定要听毛主席的话，为无产阶级教育革命贡献出自己的力量。
    贫下中农对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情和对无产阶级教育革命的关心，大大教育和鼓舞了学校的革命教师们。他们表示，一定要胸怀对毛主席的一个忠字，敢字当头，排除万难，在教育革命中立新功。参加学习班的大队和生产队干部，也进一步认识到无产阶级教育革命的深远意义，表示要更好地关心这件事，并且决定由各级领导班子进一步协助学校搞好这场革命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”西洲小学通过举办“四结合”的毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了群众性的教育革命新高潮。革命师生写出了批判文章三百多篇，召开了班级、联班和全校的批判会，编印了以毛主席著作和歌颂伟大领袖毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想为基本内容的新的政治文化课本。他们还请学生家长中的贫下中农讲阶级斗争课和生产知识课。有些革命大批判课和写作课，由学生自己讲。教师们作好了教学改革方案，主动征求贫下中农的意见，邀请贫下中农出身的学生家长到校听课，提出批评和建议。许多贫下中农出身的学生家长们，经常给自己的孩子讲家史、村史，进行阶级教育，并且主动督促子女参加学校组织的集体活动。有的学生家长说：在家里劳动容易在孩子头脑里种下私字的根，参加集体劳动就会在孩子头脑里播下公字的种子，有利于培养一心为公的革命事业的接班人。许多家长十分重视加强自己的思想革命化，用忠于毛主席的实际行动来教育自己的后代，并且积极地教育别人的孩子。孩子中有了好人好事，校内校外一齐夸；孩子中的不良倾向，校内校外一起管。这样，就使学校教育、家庭教育、社会教育更密切地配合起来，使无产阶级教育革命真正落实到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人这个百年大计上。
    目前，这个大队和所属生产队的革命干部，对抓好学校教育革命都很重视。他们指定专人抓教育革命，经常给予学校具体指导和帮助。在一个多月中，大队领导班子召开了两次扩大会议，研究怎样以毛泽东思想为指针，抓好青少年的思想政治工作，帮助学校搞好教育革命。
    经过大办“四结合”的学习班，这个大队已经从根本上改变了过去“家长管穿衣吃饭，老师管教书识字，大队干部管拨款解决学校困难”的现象，大家都比较自觉地抓学生的思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想来武装少年儿童的头脑。
    西洲小学的教育革命得到了上级革命委员会的好评，并帮助他们总结了举办“四结合”学习班的具体经验：一、大队领导班子重视，积极加强领导；二、学习时间和内容都要适合农村和贫下中农的特点，每期三五天，内容少而精，主要学习毛主席的“五·七”指示和选学毛主席有关无产阶级教育革命的论述，学深学透，有针对性地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，边学习边批判；三、贯穿回忆对比的阶级教育，激发对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情；四、与农村整个革命大批判结合起来，把中国赫鲁晓夫妄想在农村复辟资本主义和推行修正主义教育路线的恶毒阴谋联系起来进行批判。
    目前，这些经验已开始在本县和本专区推广。
