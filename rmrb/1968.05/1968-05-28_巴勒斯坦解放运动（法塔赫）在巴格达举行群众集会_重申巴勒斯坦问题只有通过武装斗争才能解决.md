Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Movement, held a mass rally in the Iraqi capital on the evening of May 17 to commemorate "Palestine Day," vowing to carry the revolution through to the end.

The rally was conducted in a revolutionary and combative atmosphere. Speakers unanimously strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by Israeli Zionists, backed by American imperialism, against the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples, and vowed to make the enemy pay for their blood debts.

The speakers reiterated that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved through armed struggle.

Representatives of some Iraqi mass organizations and foreign friends in Baghdad, who spoke at the rally, highly praised the heroism shown by the Palestinian guerrillas in their struggle and expressed their firm support for the armed struggle of the Palestinian people until final victory is achieved. They said that the path of armed struggle is the only correct way to achieve the liberation of Palestine.

Iraqi Minister of Culture and Guidance Malik Hassan, speaking on behalf of the Iraqi government, said at the rally that the Iraqi government supports the armed struggle of the Palestinian people. He said, "Through armed struggle, the Arab people can foil the imperialist conspiracies within and outside the occupied territories."

On the previous evening, the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Baghdad also held a mass rally to commemorate "Palestine Day."

Iraqi Prime Minister Taher Yahya attended the rally and delivered a speech. He said, "The ever-expanding Palestinian resistance movement, or the thunderous revolution of 'Fatah,' has taken its rightful place in the decisive battle. It will undoubtedly become the turning point leading to an early victory."

He further stated, "There can be no peace with those who desecrate sacred lands. There is no question of surrender to the Ben-Gurion, Johnson, and Dayan gangs. There will be no peace with these gangs, nor will there be any round-table or rectangular-table talks."

    巴勒斯坦解放运动（法塔赫）在巴格达举行群众集会
    重申巴勒斯坦问题只有通过武装斗争才能解决
    新华社巴格达电　巴勒斯坦解放运动（法塔赫）十七日晚在伊拉克首都举行群众集会，纪念“巴勒斯坦日”，表示决心把革命进行到底。
    集会是在革命和战斗的气氛中进行的。会上发言的人一致强烈谴责受美帝国主义支持的以色列犹太复国主义者对巴勒斯坦人民和其他阿拉伯人民犯下的滔天罪行，并且表示一定要使敌人偿还血债。
    发言的人重申，巴勒斯坦问题只有通过武装斗争才能解决。
    一些伊拉克群众组织的代表和在巴格达的外国朋友在会上讲话时，高度赞扬巴勒斯坦游击队在斗争中所表现的英雄主义，并表示他们坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，直到取得最后胜利。他们说，武装斗争的道路是取得巴勒斯坦解放的唯一正确的道路。
    伊拉克文化和指导部长马利克·哈桑代表伊拉克政府在会上讲话表示，伊拉克政府支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。他说：“通过武装斗争，阿拉伯人民能够挫败帝国主义在被占领的土地内外的阴谋。”
    在前一天晚上，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻巴格达办事处也举行了纪念“巴勒斯坦日”的群众集会。
    伊拉克总理塔赫尔·叶海亚出席了集会，并且讲了话。他说：“规模日益扩大的巴勒斯坦抵抗运动，或者说，‘法塔赫’的势如雷霆的革命，在决定命运的战斗中占了应有的地位。它必将成为导致早日胜利的转折点。”
    他还说：“同亵渎神圣国土的战犯毫无和平可言。对本—古里安、约翰逊和达扬匪帮绝对谈不上投降。同这些匪帮不会有和平，也不会有圆桌或长方桌会谈。”
