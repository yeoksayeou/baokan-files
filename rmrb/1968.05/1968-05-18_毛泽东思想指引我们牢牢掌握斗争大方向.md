The radiant Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We, the comrades of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew of the Beijing Railway Bureau, follow the spirit of the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and the spirit of the "Sixteen Points." We follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the chief question for the revolution." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we strictly distinguish between enemies, ourselves, and friends, and differentiate between two types of contradictions. We unite with the revolutionary masses and strike down a handful of class enemies.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we deeply understand that: under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most principal and dangerous enemy is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Our contradiction with this handful of capitalist roaders is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. To actively and continuously launch attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and all class enemies is the direction of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." We understand that if the revolutionary masses oppose each other and relax their exposure and criticism of class enemies, they will fall into the enemy's trap. Therefore, we have always directed our struggle against a handful of class enemies. We have written many big-character posters exposing and criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, striking hard at the class enemies, and advocating and promoting the unity of revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. We must be ruthless towards the enemy and crush it; we must be united with comrades and emphasize unity. We must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unite all revolutionary forces and jointly fight the enemy.

Through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have an even deeper understanding of the importance of defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest responsibility of our working class and the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. We must further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of revolutionary struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    毛泽东思想指引我们牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    北京铁路局“毛泽东号”机车组
    光芒四射的毛泽东思想，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯！我们“毛泽东号”机车组的同志，遵照毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的精神，遵照“十六条”的精神，遵照毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中，严格分清敌、我、友，区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结革命群众，打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    在毛泽东思想指引下，我们深刻地认识到：在无产阶级专政条件下，最主要最危险的敌人是那些打着红旗反红旗的党内一小撮走资派。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，代表了国民党反动派、帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益。我们和这一小撮走资派的矛盾是主要矛盾，是对抗性矛盾；主动地持续地向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人发动进攻，是这场无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向。
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。”我们认识到，如果革命群众之间互相对立，放松了对阶级敌人的揭发批判，那就上了敌人的当。所以，我们始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人。我们写了很多揭发批判党内一小撮走资派的大字报，狠狠打击了阶级敌人，而对革命群众和革命群众组织，我们一直是主张和促进在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现革命的大联合。对敌人要狠，要压倒它；对同志要和，要讲团结。我们要在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，团结一切革命力量，共同对敌。
    通过无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我们更深刻地认识到保卫无产阶级政权的重要。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。这是我们工人阶级最大的职责，对毛主席最大的忠。我们要进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
