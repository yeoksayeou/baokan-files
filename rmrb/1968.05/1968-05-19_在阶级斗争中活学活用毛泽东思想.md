Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon guiding us in our struggle against all class enemies. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dongfanghong Production Brigade, Gaocun People's Commune, have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with boundless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized as never before.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the great historical document—the May 16 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—which points out: "Those in authority who are taking the capitalist road and are in power within the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Comrade Lin Biao instructs us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the thought of class struggle." We deeply feel that to study Mao Zedong Thought, the most fundamental thing is to learn Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle; it is to study with the problems of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to study in the struggle, and to apply in the struggle. Only in this way can we study deeply, apply flexibly, raise our awareness of class struggle and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, and continuously launch attacks on class enemies.

For a long time, Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, has opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has vigorously advocated the reactionary theory of the "extinction of class struggle" and frantically carried out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. His essence is to attempt to make our working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary people forget about class and class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. This is nothing but a pipe dream! We suffered the most and harbored the deepest grudges in the old society. We understand class oppression and exploitation the best, we understand class struggle the best, and we also understand revolution the best. Therefore, we feel most intimate studying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle of class struggle, and applying Mao Zedong Thought flexibly in the struggle is also the most effective.

The actual struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years has made me realize more deeply that Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" is extremely wise and correct. Only by adopting the viewpoint of class struggle can we see the essence of things. For example, my understanding of being concerned about state affairs was that we poor and lower-middle peasants only needed to work hard and contribute more to the state. Through studying Mao Zedong Thought in the intense struggle of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, I have deeply realized that to be concerned about state affairs, we must first be concerned about class struggle, be concerned about the struggle between the two lines, be concerned about the country not changing color, and ensure that the power is always in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dongfanghong Production Brigade, have, in the revolutionary criticism, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the actual struggle of the past more than ten years between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in our brigade, exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods advocated by Liu Shaoqi, greatly raised the class consciousness and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the proletariat, and further ignited our boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao; deepened our extreme hatred for Liu Shaoqi. Recently, we have used Chairman Mao's teachings on the viewpoint of class struggle to analyze the new trends of class enemies, quickly exposed the evil plots of a small handful of class enemies who, under the banner of "rebellion," sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, and swiftly launched a new battle, repelled the counterattack of class enemies, and achieved new victories in class struggle.

    在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想
    全国农业劳动模范、山东省贫下中农革命造反总指挥部负责人、文登县高村公社东方红大队负责人  张富贵
    毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子。毛泽东思想是指导我们向一切阶级敌人进行战斗的最锐利的武器。我们高村公社东方红大队贫下中农和革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，活学活用毛主席著作，毛泽东思想空前大普及。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》中指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”林彪副主席指示我们：
  “毛泽东思想就是阶级斗争的思想”。我们深深体会到，学习毛泽东思想，最根本的就是要学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导；就是带着无产阶级文化大革命中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的问题学，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。这样才能学得深，用得活，才能提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，不断地向阶级敌人进攻。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大肆鼓吹反动的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线。他的要害就是妄图使我们工人阶级、贫下中农和革命人民忘记阶级和阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。这完全是白日作梦！我们在旧社会苦最大，仇最深，我们最懂得阶级压迫和阶级剥削，最懂得阶级斗争，也最懂得革命。因此，我们在阶级斗争中学习毛泽东思想感到最亲切，在斗争中活用毛泽东思想也最灵验。
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实际斗争，使我更深刻地认识到，毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，无比英明，无比正确。只有带上阶级斗争的观点，才能看到事情的本质。比如我对关心国家大事的理解，以前认为我们贫下中农，只要好好劳动，多交公粮，就可以了。通过在激烈的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中学习毛泽东思想，我深刻地认识到，关心国家大事，首先要关心阶级斗争，关心两条路线斗争，关心国家不变颜色，保证政权永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。
    我们东方红大队贫下中农和革命干部，在革命大批判中，活学活用毛泽东思想，结合本大队十多年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的反革命修正主义黑货，进行了大揭发、大批判，大大提高了无产阶级的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加激发了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱；加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。最近，我们又用毛主席教导的阶级斗争的观点，分析阶级敌人的新动向，很快识破了打着“造反”旗号的一小撮阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏生产的罪恶阴谋，迅速展开一场新的战斗，击退了阶级敌人的反扑，取得了阶级斗争的新胜利。
