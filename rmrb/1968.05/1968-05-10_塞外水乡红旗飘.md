	Red Flags Fly Over the Water Town in the Borderlands
	People's Liberation Army General Logistics Department

	In the past, the highlands of Yanggao in the borderlands were notorious for being a place of "nine years of drought in ten." Locals had a saying: "The wind blows and the sun bakes the stones dry, getting water is harder than getting oil, the fields are like a burning fire, wanting a good harvest depends on the heavens."

	Today, the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," self-reliant and hardworking, have transformed a barren, drought-stricken land at the foot of the Great Wall into a water town that produces abundant rice in just two years.

	The "May 7th Directive" spreads red seeds, the spring breeze blows through the Yumen Pass

	In May 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the epoch-making "May 7th Directive." The unit's party committee promptly organized all cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members to repeatedly study and discuss it in depth. Everyone decided to do a good job in agricultural and sideline production and to establish a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The unit's involvement in agricultural and sideline production brought up some ideological issues. Some soldiers said, "At home, we plow the fields, and in the army, we still plow the fields. What's the difference between us and the farmers?" Some cadres were also concerned that production work would affect normal operations. The party committee believed that to effectively implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and do a good job in the unit's production, we must first carry out ideological reform among the personnel. The party committee went deep into the grassroots, worked and studied with the cadres and soldiers, and addressed the soldiers' ideological issues, pointing out: "We are the sons and daughters of workers and peasants and must always maintain the character of the working people. We can only be the same as the farmers and never different from them. Liu Shaoqi wants us to detach ourselves from the working people, and we will not fall for it." The barracks, work sites, and fields all became classrooms for propagating and studying the "May 7th Directive." Everyone used Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" as a weapon to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing's trash. Comrades said, "These guys want to turn our army into a bourgeois army that deviates from proletarian politics and is detached from the masses. Their hearts are more poisonous than scorpions!"

	The more we criticized, the deeper our hatred for Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing, and the deeper our understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." Everyone said, Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is a new development of Marxism-Leninism, and we must fully implement Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," turning our army into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the ideological reform of all officers and soldiers, making our army forever maintain and carry forward the revolutionary tradition, forever be closely connected with the masses, and build an iron Great Wall in our hearts to resist and prevent revisionism.

	With "loyalty" in our hearts, we create great deeds, and the "May 7th Directive" blooms red flowers

	"The sky connects the five ridges with silver hoes falling, the earth shakes the three rivers with iron arms shaking." The officers and soldiers, with Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as their driving force, launched a battle against the barren land and drought-stricken fields. The party committee put forward the slogan "Break the old framework, grow rice on the highlands," and the entire unit presented a new and vibrant scene.

	Yanggao Valley is high in altitude, with strong winds and little rain. Without water, how can we grow rice? The officers and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, did not believe in the heavens or the earth, but had unlimited faith in Chairman Mao. Comrades threw themselves into the well-digging battle, determined to "carry the treasure book of the 'Three Articles,' dare to turn the borderlands into the south of the Yangtze River. We vow to achieve a bumper harvest and defy the heavens!"

	In the deep autumn of the borderlands, the cold wind howled, and the chill was piercing. Communist Party member and deputy instructor Hu Meiliang led the members of the service company's eighth platoon to fight on the well platform. Facing the bone-chilling cold wind, they recited "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" over and over again. The deputy instructor worked while explaining the heroic deeds of the Red Army crossing the snow-capped mountains and grasslands to the comrades, and the comrades found inexhaustible strength in their bodies. The joyous news of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards for the eighth time reached the well platform, and the comrades looked towards the east, waving their red books, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" over and over again. Communist Party member and platoon leader Liu Zhenyuan said, "The place where we stand is not a well platform, but a battlefield to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must fight bravely, win victory, and give a resounding slap in the face of the bourgeois reactionary line with our actual actions!" The comrades forgot about the cold and fatigue, and the more they worked, the more enthusiastic they became.

	After more than four months of hard work, the wells were successfully dug, and clear spring water flowed into the rice fields. Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" nourished the red flowers of "public spirit" in the hearts of the officers and soldiers.

	Last spring, it was time to transplant the seedlings. Party committee member Kang Jingting rolled up his pants and transplanted seedlings with the soldiers. The comrades said, "Comrade, you are so old and your health is not good, please stay on the shore to send fertilizer!" He smiled and said, "The older you are, the more you should temper yourself, the more you temper yourself, the less private thoughts you have. If you are afraid of the cold and hardship, you cannot implement Chairman Mao's 'May 7th Directive.'" Comrades from the north did not know how to transplant seedlings, so they learned from the comrades from the south. All cadres, soldiers, and workers were full of enthusiasm and transplanted seedlings in all the fields they had opened up.

	The "May 7th Directive" bears fruit, and red flags fly over the water town in the borderlands

	Just as the rice was about to ripen last August, it rained heavily for three consecutive days, causing a mountain flood that washed away a breach in the embankment, seriously threatening the safety of the rice and the crops of the production team in the garrison. The comrades of the eighth platoon guarding the rice fields rushed to the rice fields like the wind. Liu Zhenyuan led the charge into the torrent, and the comrades followed, jumping into the water to engage in a fierce battle with the mountain flood. The villagers of the garrison rushed to support them upon hearing the news. The arms of the military and the people were tightly linked, forming a human wall, facing the torrent, and reciting together, "With determination, we are not afraid of sacrifice, we will overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." After more than four hours of hard work, they finally plugged the breach. The villagers praised, "The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are indeed steel soldiers tempered in the school of Mao Zedong Thought, rushing to where there is danger, just like charging in battle." The comrades replied, "The military and the people are united as one, let's see who can defeat us!"

	The sun shines brightly over the highlands, the autumn is clear and fragrant with rice flowers. Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" illuminates thousands of mountains and rivers, and redden the hearts of every soldier. Cultivating rice fields in the borderlands is both a good battlefield for production labor and a good classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army have fought for two years, opening up more than three hundred acres of paddy fields and dry fields. Through implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been pushed to a new height, promoting the ideological reform of all personnel.

　　塞外水乡红旗飘
　　人民解放军总后勤部　塞外红
    过去，塞外高原的阳高，是出名的“十年九旱”的地方。当地流传着这么几句话：“风吹日晒石头干，吃水要比吃油难，地里如同点把火，要想丰收靠老天。”
    今天，解放军某部指战员，胸怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，坚决贯彻毛主席的光辉的“五·七”指示，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，短短两年时间，把长城脚下一片干旱的荒地，改造成盛产稻谷的水乡。
    “五·七”指示播红种，春风吹遍雁门关
    一九六六年五月，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了划时代的“五·七”指示，部队党委及时组织全体干部、战士、职工、家属，进行了反复学习和深入讨论。大家决心搞好农副业生产，办好毛泽东思想大学校。
    部队搞农副业生产，出现了一些思想问题。有的战士说：“在家里打土坷垃，到部队还是打土坷垃，这和农民有啥两样？”个别干部也怕搞生产影响正常作业。针对这些活思想，党委认为：要很好地贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，搞好部队生产，首先要搞好所属人员的思想革命化。党委分别深入基层，跟干部、战士同劳动、同学习，并且针对战士的活思想，指出：“我们是工农子弟兵，要永远保持劳动人民的本色。我们只能同农民一样，决不能同农民两样。中国赫鲁晓夫就是要我们脱离劳动人民，我们决不上当。”营房里、作业现场、田间地头，都变成了宣传、学习“五·七”指示的课堂。大家以毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿所搞的那一套破烂货。同志们说：“这些家伙妄想把我军演变成背离无产阶级政治、脱离群众的资产阶级军队，真是心比蝎子还毒！”
    大家越批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿的仇恨越深，对毛主席的“五·七”指示的伟大意义认识就越深。大家说，毛主席的“五·七”指示是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，我们一定要全面落实毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，促进全体指战员的思想革命化，使我军永远保持和发扬革命传统，永远同人民群众血肉相连，在我们灵魂深处铸起防修反修的钢铁长城。
　　胸怀“忠”字创大业，“五·七”指示开红花
    “天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。”指战员们以毛主席的“五·七”指示为动力，向荒地开战，向旱田要粮。党委向全体人员提出“打破旧框框，高原种水稻”的口号，整个部队出现一片热气腾腾的新景象。
    阳高川，地势高，风沙大，很少下雨。没有水，怎么能种水稻？用毛泽东思想武装起来的全体指战员，不信天，不信地，无限信仰毛主席。同志们投入打井的战斗，决心“胸揣宝书‘老三篇’，敢让塞外变江南。誓夺丰收，气死老天！”
    塞外深秋的夜晚，寒风呼啸，冷气逼人。共产党员、副指导员胡美亮同志带领勤务连八班的同志们奋战在井台上。迎着刺骨的寒风，他们一遍又一遍地背诵《愚公移山》。副指导员一边劳动，一边给同志们讲红军爬雪山、过草地的英雄事迹，同志们身上增添了用不完的力量。毛主席八次接见红卫兵的喜讯传到井台上，同志们遥望东方，挥动红彤彤的宝书，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”共产党员、班长刘振远说：“咱们站的这块地方，不是井台，是捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的阵地。我们要勇敢战斗，夺取胜利，以实际行动给予资产阶级反动路线迎头痛击！”同志们忘记了寒冷和疲劳，越干劲头越大。
    奋战四个多月，眼眼水井打成功了，清清的泉水流进稻田。毛主席“五·七”指示的雨露，滋润着指战员们心中“公”字的红花。
    去年春天，开始插秧了。党委委员康镜亭同志挽起裤子，同战士们一道插秧。同志们说：“首长，你年纪这么大了，身体又不好，在岸上送肥吧！”他笑着说：“越老越要炼，越炼私心越少。怕冷怕苦，就不能落实毛主席的‘五·七’指示。”来自北方的同志不会插秧，就拜南方同志为师。全体干部、战士、职工，干劲冲天，把开出来的水田都插了秧。
    “五·七”指示结硕果，塞外水乡飘红旗
    就在水稻快要成熟的去年八月间，接连下了三天瓢泼大雨，山洪暴发，堤堰被冲开一个缺口，严重威胁着水稻和驻地生产队庄稼的安全。守卫水稻的八班同志们，飞一样奔向稻田。刘振远同志带头冲向激流，同志们紧接着跳进水中，同山洪展开一场激烈的搏斗。驻地社员闻讯赶来支援。军民的手臂紧紧地挽在一起，结成一道人墙，面对激流，一齐朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”奋战四个多小时，终于堵上了缺口。社员们称赞说：“解放军同志真是毛泽东思想大学校里锤炼出来的钢铁战士，哪里危险往哪里冲，象战场上打冲锋一样。”同志们回答说：“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    阳光灿烂照高原，秋高气爽稻花香。毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照亮了千山万水，照红了每个战士的心。塞外垦稻田，既是生产劳动的好战场，又是活学活用毛泽东思想的好课堂。解放军某部全体指战员奋战两年，开出水田和旱地三百多亩。通过落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，促进了全体人员的思想革命化。
