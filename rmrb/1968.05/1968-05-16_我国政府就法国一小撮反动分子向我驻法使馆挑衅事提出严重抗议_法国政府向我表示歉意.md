In the evening of May 13, hundreds of reactionaries gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in France, shouting anti-China slogans and engaging in political provocations. Several rioters even climbed onto the embassy's balcony, assaulting Chinese embassy staff, throwing stones that shattered embassy windows, and stealing the embassy's copper plaque.

The responsible official from the Western Europe Division of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Paris both lodged a serious protest with the French side in Beijing and Paris, respectively. They demanded that the French side immediately take measures to severely punish the perpetrators, compensate for all losses incurred by the Chinese side, take responsibility for retrieving the embassy's copper plaque, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

The French government expressed deep regret over this incident and is willing to compensate for all losses, take responsibility for retrieving the embassy's copper plaque, and take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

    新华社十五日讯　五月十三日傍晚，数百名反动分子纠集在我国驻法国大使馆门前高呼反华口号，进行政治挑衅。数名暴徒甚至攀登上使馆凉台，殴打我使馆工作人员，投掷石子打碎使馆玻璃，并劫走我使馆铜牌。
    我外交部西欧司负责人和我驻法使馆临时代办分别在北京和巴黎就此事向法方提出严重抗议，要求法方立即采取措施，严惩肇事者，赔偿我方一切损失，负责追回我使馆铜牌，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    法国政府对此表示极大的遗憾，愿意赔偿一切损失，负责追回我使馆铜牌，并采取必要措施，避免今后发生类似事件。
