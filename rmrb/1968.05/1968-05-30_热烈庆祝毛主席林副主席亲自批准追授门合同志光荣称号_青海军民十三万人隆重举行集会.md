	Firmly resolve to be like Comrade Men He: "Think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao." Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, and immediately launch a massive and sustained campaign to propagate and learn from Comrade Men He throughout the province.

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XINING, May 29 -- Recently, 130,000 military personnel and revolutionary masses from the People's Liberation Army in the Xining region of Qinghai Province held a grand meeting to celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approving the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." The military personnel and revolutionary masses who attended the meeting firmly resolved to be like Comrade Men He: "Think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao." In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they will stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive, and sacrifice for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead.

	In Qinghai Province, the campaign to learn from Comrade Men He has been widely launched. Comrade Men He's glorious deeds are known in every household in many regions and have become a great driving force for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the day of the meeting, the broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans to learn from Comrade Men He as they came from all directions into the venue.

	The central part of the stage was adorned with a large portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. The large banners on either side read: "Launch a larger-scale enthusiastic campaign of supporting the army and loving the people," "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," and Comrade Men He's oath before his death: "Think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao."

	The meeting began with the solemn song "The East is Red." Following this, the order from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group posthumously awarding Comrade Men He the title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" was read, as well as the decision by the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Qinghai Provincial Military District Party Committee to launch the campaign to propagate and learn from Comrade Men He.

	Zhang Jianglin, the first vice chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and deputy commander of the Qinghai Provincial Military District, spoke at the meeting. He said: At this moment, when the entire nation's military and civilian personnel are high-spirited, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing victoriously, and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This is the greatest honor for all the soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the greatest honor for the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses of Qinghai Province.

	Zhang Jianglin pointed out that Comrade Men He, in his twenty years of revolutionary struggle, has always been loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, setting a brilliant example for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole nation. The military and civilian personnel of the entire province must, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest action, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, and immediately launch a massive and sustained campaign to propagate and learn from Comrade Men He throughout the province. Through learning from Comrade Men He, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further launch a high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, actively and unceasingly launch attacks on class enemies, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit, grasp revolution, and promote production, and swear to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

	In his speech, Zhang Jianglin demanded that the revolutionary committees at all levels in Qinghai Province not only lead the campaign to learn from Comrade Men He but also take the lead in learning from him. The members of the revolutionary committees must, as Comrade Men He said, be infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, constantly create new achievements for the people, strengthen the construction of the revolutionary committees, and truly turn Qinghai Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	Song Changeng, the political commissar of the Qinghai Provincial Military District, spoke at the meeting, saying that Comrade Men He could become a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line because he had a heart full of loyalty to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and he grasped the use of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, he had the greatest courage, the strongest fighting power, and the most sublime communist morality. Learning from him, we must regard studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the first need of life and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action.

	Representatives of the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary cadres of Qinghai Province, representatives of the unit where Comrade Men He served, representatives of the revolutionary masses of Baqiang Farm, and Comrade Men He's wife, Zhang Fengying, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would take Comrade Men He as an example, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and sacrifice for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead. Shi Yanrui, who was rescued by Comrade Men He, said excitedly: The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary cadres of Baqiang Farm will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, further deepen the campaign to learn from Comrade Men He, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	The meeting, amid warm applause, passed a telegram of congratulations to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    新华社西宁二十九日电　青海省西宁地区人民解放军指战员和革命群众十三万多人，最近隆重集会，热烈庆祝伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准，由中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号。参加集会的人民解放军指战员和革命群众坚决表示，要象门合同志那样：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，坚定地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    在青海省，向门合同志学习的活动已经广泛开展起来。门合同志的光辉事迹，在许多地区家喻户晓，成了推动无产阶级文化大革命乘胜前进的巨大动力。开会这天，广大指战员、无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼着向门合同志学习的口号，从四面八方走进会场。
    大会主席台中央悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，两旁的巨幅标语上写着：“更大规模地开展热烈的拥军爱民活动”、“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，以及门合同志生前的誓言：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”
    大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。接着，宣读了中共中央、中央军委、中央文革追授门合同志“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”称号的命令，宣读了青海省革命委员会、青海省军区党委关于开展宣传和学习门合同志活动的决定。
    青海省革命委员会第一副主任、青海省军区副司令员张江霖在会上讲话。他说：正当全国亿万军民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准，由中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，这是青海省军区部队全体指战员最大的光荣，是青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最大的光荣。
    张江霖指出，门合同志参加革命二十年来，一贯忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为全党、全军、全国人民树立了光辉的榜样。全省军民必须以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的行动，坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，立即在全省范围内掀起一个声势浩大的深入持久的宣传、学习门合同志的热潮。通过学习门合同志，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的高潮，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，搞好本单位的斗批改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓把文化大革命进行到底。
    张江霖同志在讲话中，要求青海省的各级革命委员会，不仅要领导好学习门合同志的活动，而且要带头学好门合同志。革命委员会的成员，要象门合同志所说的那样，无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不断为人民立新功，加强革委会的建设，真正把青海省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    青海省军区政委宋长庚在会上讲话说，门合同志能够成为一个无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部，最根本的原因是他对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，学习毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，所以他有最大的勇敢，最强的战斗力，最崇高的共产主义品德。我们学习他，就要把活学活用毛主席著作当作生命的第一需要，用毛泽东思想指导自己的每一个行动。
    青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派的代表、门合同志生前所在部队的代表、巴仓农场革命群众代表、门合同志的爱人张凤英，先后在会上讲话。他们一致表示，要以门合同志为榜样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。被门合同志抢救的史延瑞激动地说：我们巴仓农场的“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，更加深入地开展学习门合同志的活动，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    大会在热烈的掌声中，通过了向伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
