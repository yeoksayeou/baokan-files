Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and is a great struggle that touches the very soul of the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of the whole country under its leadership, and a great struggle that touches the very soul of the Chinese people. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, we have led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to vigorously carry out class struggle, launching a sustained and fierce attack on a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries within the factory, and on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev and their agents within the factory. We have smashed their evil plots to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. In the struggle, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses of workers have been greatly heightened, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad revolutionary masses of workers have been aroused. Now, the entire factory is presenting a scene of both revolutionary and production bounties. The factory's production in the first ten days of May increased by 32 percent compared to the first ten days of April. The revolutionary workers of the A shift in the fine spinning workshop have worked hard, striven to be the best, and continuously created new production records, surpassing the highest average shift production level of the past few years.

In the sharp and complex class struggle, we have always paid attention to deeply and persistently carrying out the great criticism. Under the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have used various methods to concentrate their firepower, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in our factory. Practice has proven that the deeper the great criticism goes, the redder the hearts of the revolutionary masses become, the brighter their eyes become, the firmer their will to fight against class enemies becomes, and the higher their revolutionary enthusiasm becomes. The broad revolutionary masses of workers insist on eight hours of production and insist on carrying out the revolution in their spare time, conducting the great criticism. The attendance rate for production has significantly improved, and production has increased sharply. The fine spinning C shift, which has been relatively backward in production in the past, has caught up and surpassed in the great criticism, creating the highest night shift production record since the Cultural Revolution.

On the basis of the great criticism, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have firmly grasped the initiative in class struggle and strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army has always had two policies: first, be ruthless to the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." In the struggle, we have learned from the Three-Eight Style of the People's Liberation Army, insisting on thorough and detailed ideological work, uniting and educating the vast majority of cadres and masses, uniting and winning over allies, and uniting all revolutionary forces under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many workers say: "When we are united, when we have caught the class enemies, when our minds are at ease, production will be promoted." The revolutionary workers in the weaving workshop have united to fight against the enemy, doubled their efforts, broken the old production rules, and completed the production task that originally took fifteen days in just six days.

The editorial "The Red Land of Northeast" points out that we must resolutely and seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of grabbing the revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness, and make greater contributions on the fronts of national defense, industry, agriculture, transportation, and communications. The broad revolutionary masses of workers in our factory read it and unanimously agreed that resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grab the revolution, promote production" is the most practical action to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously carry out class struggle, vigorously promote industrial production, continue to make efforts, advance victoriously, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    努力实现革命生产双丰收
    北京第三棉纺织厂革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们遵循毛主席这一伟大教导，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，带领广大革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，向厂内一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在厂内的代理人，发动了持续的猛烈的进攻，粉碎了他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的罪恶阴谋。在斗争中，大大提高了广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，激发了广大革命职工的革命热情和生产积极性。现在，全厂到处出现革命、生产双丰收的景象。全厂生产五月上旬比四月上旬提高了百分之三十二。细纱车间甲班革命职工，鼓足干劲，力争上游，不断创造生产新纪录，超过了近几年平均班产量的最高水平。
    在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们一直注意深入持久地开展革命大批判。在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，广大革命职工采用各种方法，集中火力，把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在我厂内代理人的反革命罪行，批深批透，批倒批臭。实践证明，革命大批判越深入，革命群众的心越红，眼越亮，向阶级敌人斗争的意志越坚强，革命干劲越高涨。广大革命职工坚持八小时生产，坚持业余时间闹革命，进行革命大批判，生产出勤率显著提高，生产大幅度上升。过去生产一直比较落后的细纱丙班，在革命大批判中，急起直追，迎头赶上，创造了文化大革命以来夜班生产的最高纪录。
    广大革命职工在革命大批判的基础上，紧紧掌握阶级斗争的主动权，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。毛主席教导我们：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”在斗争中，我们学习人民解放军的三八作风，坚持深入细致的思想工作，团结和教育绝大多数的干部和群众，团结和争取同盟军，使一切革命力量在毛主席革命路线指引下团结起来。许多工人说：“自己人团结起来了，阶级敌人抓住了，心情舒畅了，生产就促上来了。”织布车间革命职工团结对敌，干劲倍增，打破了生产陈规，原来要十五天才能完成的生产任务，六天就完成了。
    《东北大地红烂熳》这篇社论指出，要坚决地、认真地执行伟大领袖毛主席抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的方针，在国防、工农业、交通运输等战线上作出更大的贡献。我厂广大革命职工读了以后，一致认为坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，就是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的最实际的行动。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，猛促工业生产，再接再厉，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
