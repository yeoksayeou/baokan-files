The Tokyo Metropolitan Committee (Leftist Faction) Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Communist Party recently made a decision to enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's great statement issued on April 16 in support of the American black people's struggle against violence. The Preparatory Committee calls on all party organizations and members under its jurisdiction to first of all seriously study this statement, arm their minds with the revolutionary ideas contained in it; widely propagate the ideas of the statement among the people, enhance the people's confidence; and in response to the call of the statement, immediately make serious preparations for launching a "prolonged and fierce attack" on the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and their accomplices, the Revisionist clique led by Miyamoto.

The inaugural issue of the organ of the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee (Leftist Faction) Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, "People's Star," published on April 25, featured the full text of Chairman Mao's statement issued on April 16 as the lead article on the front page.

"The People's Star" also published a decision by the Preparatory Committee supporting Chairman Mao's statement, which pointed out that this statement is a truly great Marxist-Leninist document. "This document is not only of great significance in evaluating the significance of the American black people's struggle, but also of extremely important significance in correctly analyzing the current world revolutionary situation and clearly pointing out how true revolutionaries should struggle."

The decision states: As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in this statement, "...among the more than 20 million American blacks, there lies a tremendously powerful revolutionary force." Among the people who are oppressed and exploited under imperialism and all systems of exploitation, there lies a powerful revolutionary force. Over the more than 20 years since the war, the Japanese people, who have been living in misery due to the oppression and exploitation of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, also harbor a powerful revolutionary force. We must have great confidence in this and strive to unleash this revolutionary force.

The decision states: We must grasp the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong in the statement: "The American black people's struggle will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement and ultimately put an end to the evil rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie." In Japan, we must strive to combine the struggles of students and the working people with the struggles of the most advanced and revolutionary class, the working class, and lead this struggle to final victory.

　　日共东京都委员会（左派）筹备会号召所属一切党组织
　　用毛主席声明的革命思想武装起来
　　向美日反动派和日修发动持久猛攻
    新华社东京三日电  日本共产党东京都委员会（左派）筹备会最近作出决定，热烈拥护毛主席在四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的伟大声明。筹备会号召它所属的一切党组织和党员，首先要认真学习这一声明，以这一声明的革命思想武装自己的头脑；把声明的思想广泛地向人民群众传播，增强人民的信心；同时响应声明的号召，为向美日反动派及其帮凶宫本修正主义集团发动“持久的猛烈的进攻”，立即认真地进行准备工作。
    四月二十五日出版的日共东京都委员会（左派）筹备会的机关报《人民之星》创刊号上，以头版头条位置，全文刊登了毛主席四月十六日发表的声明。
    《人民之星》同时刊登的筹备会拥护毛主席声明的决定指出，这个声明是一个真正伟大的马克思列宁主义的文献。“这一文献，不仅在估价美国黑人斗争的意义这一点上，具有重要的意义，而且在正确地分析当前的世界革命形势，并明确地指出真正的革命者应该怎样奋斗这一点上，具有极为重要的意义。”
    决定说：正象毛泽东同志在这个声明中所指出的，“……在两千多万美国黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量”，在帝国主义和一切剥削制度下受压迫和受剥削的人民中，蕴藏着强大的革命力量。战后二十多年来，由于美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的压迫和剥削而过着痛苦生活的日本人民中，也蕴藏着强大的革命力量。我们应当对此抱有极大的信心，为发挥这一革命力量而努力。
    决定说，必须掌握毛泽东同志在声明中的教导：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”在日本要努力使学生和劳动人民的斗争和现代最先进、最革命的阶级工人阶级的斗争结合起来，并且把这一斗争引导到最后胜利。
