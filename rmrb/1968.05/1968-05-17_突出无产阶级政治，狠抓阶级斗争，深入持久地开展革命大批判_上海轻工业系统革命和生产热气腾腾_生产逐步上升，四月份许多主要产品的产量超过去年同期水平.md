The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in the light industry system of Shanghai City have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, emphasized proletarian politics, intensified class struggle, and conducted in-depth and prolonged revolutionary criticism. As a result, revolution and production have presented a vibrant scene.

Since this year, Shanghai's light industry production has been on the rise month by month. In March, the total output value increased by 57 percent compared to February, and in April, it increased by 18.3 percent compared to March. In April, the production of many major products such as sewing machines, canned goods, matches, computers, toothpaste, clocks, fountain pens, polyvinyl chloride products, leather shoes, and harmonicas exceeded the level of the same period last year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The purpose of the socialist revolution is to liberate productive forces." The Shanghai City Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings and actively implements Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Some units' cadres had a poor understanding of the significance of this great policy. The Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee first organized learning and self-criticism within the bureau to improve their ideological level. They also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to organize cadres to study, making everyone realize that whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" is a major issue related to whether or not we can achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a major issue of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After solving the ideological problem, new and old cadres united and worked hard to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, bringing about a new situation. For example, the watch industry overcame complacency and difficulties, and in April, the output value increased by 21.6 percent compared to March, exceeding the historical highest level, and saving nearly 20 percent of coal. The Aluminum Zipper Industry Company's output value in March increased by 90 percent compared to February. At that time, some cadres and masses became complacent and relaxed. Through study, they overcame this sentiment, and the industry's output value in April increased by more than 9 percent compared to March.

Since its establishment, the Shanghai City Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee has always paid attention to intensifying class struggle and using revolution to promote production. Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The Shanghai City Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary committees of various factories have followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the masses extensively, and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies. They have conducted in-depth and prolonged revolutionary criticism throughout the system, severely criticizing the revisionist fallacies of "class struggle extinction" and others propagated by China's Khrushchev, thoroughly smashing the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict and other sabotage activities. This has greatly enhanced the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers. The revolutionary masses have fully displayed their revolutionary enthusiasm, promoting the emergence of a new situation in production. The watchmaking workshop of the Shanghai Watch Factory was once controlled by a bad element, and the production situation was not good, becoming the weak link in the factory's production. Through revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses exposed this bad element, and the masses' enthusiasm was fully displayed. The daily output in April quickly increased. The Shanghai Electric Light Factory had a counter-revolutionary who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, specifically attacked the "five-good" workers and attempted to incite some people to oppose the factory revolutionary committee. During the revolutionary criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses opened their eyes, exposed this counter-revolutionary, and the factory's production quickly increased, exceeding the historical highest level.

The Shanghai Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee is determined to further intensify class struggle, conduct in-depth and prolonged revolutionary criticism, further strengthen the leadership of the movement, and achieve greater results in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

    生产逐步上升，四月份许多主要产品的产量超过去年同期水平
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海市轻工业局系统的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，革命和生产出现了一片热气腾腾的大好景象。
    今年以来，上海市轻工业生产月月上升，三月份总产值比二月份增长百分之五十七，四月份又比三月份增长百分之十八点三。四月份，缝纫机、罐头、火柴、计算机、牙膏、钟表、自来水笔、聚氯乙烯制品、皮鞋、口琴等许多主要产品的产量，都超过了去年同期水平。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力。”上海市轻工业局革命委员会牢记毛主席的教导，积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。有一些单位的干部一度对“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的意义认识不足，轻工业局革委会就首先在局革委会内部组织学习，斗私批修，提高思想，并且通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大干部进行学习，使大家认识到，贯彻不贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，是关系到能不能夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大事，是忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。解决了认识问题以后，新老干部就鼓足干劲，拧成一股绳，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使生产出现了新面貌。如钟表行业，克服自满和畏难情绪后，四月份产值比三月份提高了百分之二十一点六，超过了历史上最高水平，而且节约了煤炭近百分之二十。铝器拉链工业公司三月份产值比二月份增长百分之九十，这时部分干部和群众一度产生了自满松劲情绪。通过学习，克服了这种情绪，全行业四月份产值又比三月份提高了百分之九以上。
    上海市轻工业局革委会成立以后，始终注意狠抓阶级斗争，用抓革命来推动生产。毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”上海市轻工业局革命委员会和各工厂的革命委员会遵照毛主席这一最新指示，广泛发动群众，主动地向阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。他们在全局范围内深入持久地开展革命的大批判，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等修正主义谬论，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的翻案妖风和其他破坏活动，大大提高了无产阶级革命派和革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，广大革命职工充分发挥革命积极性，促使生产出现了崭新面貌。上海手表厂夹板车间，由于一度被一个坏家伙控制，生产情况一直不好，成为全厂生产的薄弱环节。通过革命大批判，革命群众把这个坏家伙挖了出来，群众的积极性充分发挥出来了，四月份日产量很快上升。上海电珠一厂有个反革命分子，在无产阶级文化大革命中专门打击“五好”工人，又妄图挑动一些人同厂革委会对立。在革命大批判中，无产阶级革命派和革命群众擦亮了眼睛，把这个反革命分子挖了出来，全厂生产很快上升，产量超过了历史最高水平。
    上海轻工业局革命委员会决心进一步狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，进一步加强对运动的领导，在抓革命、促生产方面作出更大的成绩。
