The order to posthumously award Comrade Meng He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," personally approved by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, has been issued! Comrade Meng He's heroic deeds have been published! The great call of the proletarian headquarters, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, inspires the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionaries. Below is a record of the discussion among some old and new cadres in Qinghai Province on learning from Comrade Meng He.

Finding the Gap, Learning from the Hero

Dagulu (Tibetan, Deputy Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Comrade Meng He's lifelong dedication to resolutely implementing and bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply educated me. At critical moments of class struggle, he used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to observe the trends of class struggle, analyze the situation of class struggle, see through the phenomena, grasp the essence, and elevate it to the height of line struggle. He is a red sentinel of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, possessing a high degree of sensitivity to line struggle. When facing the severe moment of the struggle between the two lines, he could stand up without hesitation, fearing neither attacks, nor demotions, nor dismissals, nor sacrifices, and was determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the line struggle, he was filled with the brave fighting spirit of a proletarian warrior. It was not just once or twice, but in the many line struggles he experienced in his life, he always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, contributing to and achieving merit in defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Looking at Meng He and comparing myself, I feel there is a big gap. Like Meng He, I also suffered greatly in the old society and have deep hatred for the exploiting classes. However, in terms of consciously, bravely, and firmly engaging in the struggle between the two lines, there is a big gap between me and Meng He, and I need to learn from him well.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province is at a crucial moment of achieving comprehensive victory. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines will inevitably deepen and become more complex. This poses higher and stricter requirements for every revolutionary fighter, especially for leading cadres. I am determined to take Comrade Meng He as an example, to strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the great storms of class struggle and line struggle, to continuously improve my awareness of line struggle, and to be a sentinel and a brave and steadfast fighter for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life, to stand guard, keep watch, and fight battles for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life!

Consciously, Bravely, and Firmly Engaging in Line Struggle

Wen Zicai (Old Red Army soldier, Member of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

Comrade Meng He has a high awareness of class struggle and a high awareness of line struggle. In his diary, he required himself to "always stand guard and keep watch for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fight battles." He deeply understood the great significance of engaging in line struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, so he could become a good cadre who is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and set a shining example for us.

I have been educated and cultivated by Mao Zedong Thought longer than Meng He, but my awareness of line struggle is not as high as his. Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Under socialist conditions, class struggle, with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party as the main enemy, is prominently and concentratedly manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. If we do not have the awareness of line struggle, we will easily be deceived by class enemies who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag and will stand on the wrong side at critical moments. Therefore, we must establish a clear awareness of line struggle, always pay attention to observing and analyzing things from the perspective of line struggle, solving contradictions, and unshakably implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, becoming thorough revolutionaries who continue the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Meng He has reached this height in his thoughts and actions.

As a cadre with a longer struggle experience and a member of the newly born revolutionary government, I will definitely take Comrade Meng He as an example, strive to learn Chairman Mao's teachings on line struggle, continuously improve my awareness of line struggle, maintain the revolutionary integrity of the proletariat, and continuously achieve new merits for the people.

Being Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao, Having the Highest Awareness of Line Struggle

Ma Fenghua (Young female worker, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Hongwei First Machine Tool Factory):

After learning about Comrade Meng He's heroic deeds and combining my own experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply realize that a revolutionary fighter can only have the highest class consciousness and awareness of line struggle if he is unlimitedly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. In the line struggle, to be as brave and steadfast as Meng He, one must first learn his noble quality of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, that is, first to grasp the attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao. Being loyal and devoted to Chairman Mao, having deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, will make his instructions sound particularly affectionate, study them particularly seriously, and use them with great energy, believing in Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao closely, and being ready to sacrifice for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line at any time.

I grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and I love and admire Chairman Mao very much. However, relying solely on simple love and admiration is far from being able to achieve unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Now, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. With Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, our country can prevent capitalist restoration and liberate oppressed nations and peoples around the world. Therefore, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the first need of the revolution, the first need of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and the first need of the proletarian interest. Meng He wrote on his gun holster: "Following Chairman Mao, always making revolution; following Chairman Mao, the world turns red." This is the class root and ideological root of his high awareness of line struggle.

Being greatly loyal to Chairman Mao, executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will have great courage. I am determined to take Comrade Meng He as an example, strive to climb the peak of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, continuously improve my class consciousness and awareness of line struggle, and struggle for life to implement and firmly defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought, Being a Thorough Revolutionary

Zhang Zhongyi (National Labor Model, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Factory 56):

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for carrying out the struggle between the two lines. To strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and improve the awareness of line struggle, we must strive to improve the self-awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This is the deepest feeling I have after learning about Comrade Meng He's heroic deeds.

Comrade Meng He said: "Mao Zedong's works must be studied every day. If you don't study for one day, you will have many problems; if you don't study for two days, you will go downhill; if you don't study for three days, you won't be able to live." He placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than anything else. He studied and applied what he learned. He resolutely fought back the fierce attacks of the rightists. He resolutely opposed the bourgeois military line of the counter-revolutionary conspirator Peng Dehuai. He consciously educated the soldiers to support the Three Red Banners against the reactionary trend of "three autonomies and one package" by the Chinese Khrushchev, exposing the enemy's plots. When the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing launched the black wind of "big comparisons," he firmly defended Chairman Mao's political line of building the army and firmly implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to emphasize proletarian politics. The series of victories in these struggles are all the results of his use of Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the struggle between the two lines.

Like Meng He, I also come from a poor peasant family. Chairman Mao rescued me from the sea of suffering. Since 1956, I have been continuously awarded the title of labor model. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I and the proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory waged a resolute struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. When the revolutionary committee was established in the factory, I was elected as the deputy chairman. Amidst the praise, I once had a sense of complacency, feeling that I had also done my best in the Cultural Revolution, and that my loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line was not too hard, but it was passable. After learning about Comrade Meng He's heroic deeds, I suddenly realized that I still have many shortcomings. I must strengthen the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought a thousand times and ten thousand times, continuously improve my awareness of line struggle, continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and be a thorough revolutionary.

    象门合同志那样，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线
    青海省一些新老干部畅谈学习门合同志的体会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，追授门合同志“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号的命令公布了！门合同志的英雄事迹发表了！无产阶级司令部的伟大号召，闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄形象，激励着亿万颗革命的红心。下面是青海省的一些新老干部学习门合同志的座谈纪要。
    找出差距，向英雄学习
    达洛（藏族，青海省革命委员会副主任）：
    门合同志一生坚决贯彻和勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的英雄事迹，使我受到最深刻的教育。在阶级斗争的关键时刻，他运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，观察阶级斗争的动向，分析阶级斗争的形势，透过现象，抓住本质，提到路线斗争的高度来认识。他是毛主席革命路线的红色哨兵，具有路线斗争的高度敏锐性。当面临两条路线斗争的严重时刻，他能毫不犹豫，毫无顾虑地挺身而出，不怕围攻，不怕处分，不怕撤职，不怕牺牲，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。他在路线斗争中充满着无产阶级战士的英勇战斗精神。他不是一次、两次，而是在他一生经历的多次路线斗争中，都能始终站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，为捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线作出了贡献，立下了功勋。
    看看门合，比比自己，感到有很大的差距。我同门合同志一样，在旧社会也受尽了阶级苦，对剥削阶级是有着深仇大恨的。但是，能够高度自觉地、勇敢地、坚定地进行两条路线斗争，这一点，我同门合同志的差距很大，需要很好地学习他。
    现在，青海省的无产阶级文化大革命正处在夺取全面胜利的关键时刻，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，必然更加深入，更加复杂。这对于每一个革命战士，尤其是领导干部，提出了更高更严的要求。我决心以门合同志为榜样，在阶级斗争和路线斗争的大风大浪中，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高路线斗争觉悟，为毛主席的革命路线当一辈子敏锐的哨兵和勇敢坚定的战士，一辈子为毛主席的革命路线站好岗，放好哨，打好仗！
    自觉、勇敢、坚定地进行路线斗争
    温子才（老红军、青海省革命委员会委员）：
    门合同志有高度的阶级斗争观念，有很高的路线斗争觉悟。他在日记中要求自己，要“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。他深深懂得在无产阶级专政条件下从事路线斗争的伟大意义，所以能够成为无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部，给我们树立了光辉榜样。
    我受毛泽东思想培养教育的时间比门合同志长，可是路线斗争觉悟却没有他高。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”在社会主义条件下的阶级斗争，由于党内一小撮走资派是主要敌人，所以，阶级斗争突出地、集中地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。如果我们没有路线斗争观念，就容易被打着红旗反红旗的阶级敌人所蒙蔽，就会在关键时刻站错队。因此，必须树立明确的路线斗争观念，时刻注意从路线斗争的角度来观察和分析事物，解决矛盾，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，做在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的彻底革命派。门合同志在思想上达到了这样的高度，在行动上也达到了这个高度。
    作为一个斗争经历较长的干部，作为新诞生的革命政权里的一个成员，我一定以门合同志为榜样，努力学习毛主席关于路线斗争的一系列教导，不断提高路线斗争觉悟，保持无产阶级的革命晚节，为人民不断立新功。
    无限忠于毛主席，才有最高的路线斗争觉悟
    马凤华（青年女工、红卫第一机床厂革命委员会副主任）：
    学习了门合同志的英雄事迹以后，结合着自己在无产阶级文化大革命中的斗争体会，我深深认识到，一个革命战士只有无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，才会有最高的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。在路线斗争中要做到象门合同志那样英勇坚定，首先要学习他无限忠于毛主席的崇高品质，也就是首先要抓对伟大领袖毛主席的态度问题。对伟大领袖毛主席忠心耿耿，怀有极为深厚的无产阶级感情，对于毛主席的指示，就会听起来格外亲切，学起来特别认真，用起来浑身是劲，就能坚信毛主席，紧跟毛主席，就能随时准备为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    我是在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露培育下成长起来的，我非常热爱毛主席，敬仰毛主席。但是，仅仅凭着朴素的热爱和敬仰的心情，是远远不能做到无限忠于毛主席的。现在，世界已进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。毛主席是我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手。有了毛主席和毛泽东思想，我国才能防止资本主义复辟，才能使全世界被压迫民族、被压迫人民得到解放。因此，忠于毛主席，是革命的第一需要，是中国革命和世界革命的第一需要，是无产阶级利益的第一需要。门合同志在他的枪套上写着：“跟着毛主席，永远闹革命；跟着毛主席，世界一片红”。这就是他具有高度路线斗争觉悟的阶级根源和思想根源。
    对毛主席怀大忠，执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线就会有大勇。我决心以门合同志为榜样，努力攀登无限忠于毛主席的思想高峰，不断提高阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，为贯彻执行和坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线奋斗终生。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，当彻底的革命派
    张忠义（全国劳动模范、五六厂革命委员会副主任）：
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是我们进行两条路线斗争最强大最锐利的思想武器。要加强阶级斗争观念，提高路线斗争觉悟，必须努力提高活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性。这是我学习门合同志英雄事迹后感受最深的一点。
    门合同志说过：“毛主席著作要天天学，一天不学问题多，两天不学走下坡，三天不学没法活。”他把学习毛主席著作，切实摆在高于一切的地位。他学了就用，学用结合。他坚决反击右派分子的猖狂进攻。他坚决反对反革命野心家彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线。他针对中国赫鲁晓夫搞“三自一包”、反对三面红旗的反动逆流，自觉地向战士进行拥护三面红旗的教育，揭露敌人的阴谋。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武的黑风时，他坚决维护毛主席的政治建军路线，坚决执行林副主席突出无产阶级政治的指示。这一系列斗争的胜利，都是他运用毛泽东思想进行两条路线斗争的结果。
    我同门合同志一样，也出身于贫农家庭。毛主席把我从苦海里拯救出来。从一九五六年起，我连续被评为劳动模范。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我和厂里的无产阶级革命派对党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争。厂里建立革委会时，我被选为副主任。在一片赞扬声中，我一度产生了自满情绪，觉得自己在文化大革命中也算尽了力，忠于毛主席的革命路线不算过得硬，也算过得去。学习了门合同志的英雄事迹，我才猛然省悟，认识到自己还有许多不够的地方。我一定要千倍万倍地加强活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高路线斗争的觉悟，在无产阶级专政下继续革命，不断革命，当彻底的革命派。
