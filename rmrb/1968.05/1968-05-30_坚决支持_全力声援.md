Resolutely Support and Fully Back the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters

The workers' movement and student movement in France have spread like wildfire across the entire country. The revolutionary struggles of the people in Europe and North America are surging like a storm, fierce and rapid. This is an important sign of the new awakening of the French and European and North American working class and broad masses, an important sign of the excellent situation of the world revolution today, and also an inevitable result of the political and economic crises in the entire capitalist world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousand and one tricks of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this principle, we then rebel, struggle, and build socialism." Since May, the student movement in France has surged to unprecedented heights, sweeping through major cities across the country. Driven by the student movement, French workers have launched a wave of strikes. The French working class has carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the great Paris Commune, defying the frenzied suppression by the French ruling class, as well as the opposition and sabotage by all kinds of traitors and scabs, and has taken a combative stance to occupy numerous factories, mines, and enterprises, detaining the capitalists who usually oppress and exploit them. The revolutionary rebellious actions of the French and European and North American workers and students are excellent! They greatly boost the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampen the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. We, the Shanghai working class, resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the French workers and students, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in Europe and North America.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." Now, with the United States at the helm, the imperialist countries are facing unprecedented class contradictions and political and economic crises, and are in a state of panic. The modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet revisionists is rapidly disintegrating. All reactionaries in the world are increasingly exposing their paper tiger nature. We are confident that the working class, revolutionary students, and revolutionary people of France and Europe and North America, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, uniting all possible forces, will give a heavy blow to their common enemy. No matter how ruthlessly the reactionaries suppress, no matter how the modern revisionists and all kinds of traitors and scabs conspire to sabotage, they cannot stop the surging revolutionary tide. History has determined that reactionary forces must fail and revolutionary forces must win!

The revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in France and Europe and North America have greatly inspired the Chinese working class, who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We Shanghai workers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the internationalist spirit of the proletariat, and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. With concrete actions of grabbing revolution and promoting production, we will support the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in France and Europe and North America and all revolutionary people around the world, and fight to the end for the establishment of a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and systems of exploitation.

    坚决支持　全力声援
    上海工人革命造反总司令部
    法国工人运动和学生运动，如燎原烈火，烧遍了整个法国。欧洲、北美各国人民的革命斗争蓬勃兴起，势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常。这是法国和欧洲、北美各国工人阶级和广大人民新觉醒的重要标志，是当前世界革命形势大好的重要标志，也是整个资本主义世界政治危机和经济危机的必然结果。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”五月以来，法国学生运动空前高涨，席卷了全国各大城市。在学生运动的推动下，法国工人掀起了罢工怒潮。法国工人阶级发扬了伟大的巴黎公社的革命精神，不顾法国统治集团的疯狂镇压，以及形形色色叛徒、工贼的反对和破坏，以战斗的姿态，占领了大批工厂、矿山和企业，把平时压迫、剥削他们的资本家扣留起来。法国和欧洲、北美各国工人、学生的革命造反行动好得很！它大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风。我们上海工人阶级最坚决地支持法国工人、学生的革命行动，最坚决地支持欧洲、北美各国工人、学生的革命斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”现在，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，阶级矛盾空前激化，政治和经济危机空前严重，惶惶不可终日。以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团正在加速分崩离析。世界上一切反动派越来越暴露出纸老虎的原形。我们坚信，法国和欧洲、北美各国的工人阶级、革命学生和革命人民，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，团结一切可以团结的力量，狠狠打击共同的敌人。不管反动派如何残酷镇压，不管现代修正主义和形形色色的叛徒、工贼如何阴谋破坏，都阻挡不住滚滚向前的革命洪流。历史注定了反动力量必败，革命力量必胜！
    法国和欧洲、北美各国工人、学生的革命斗争，极大地鼓舞了正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国工人阶级。我们上海工人决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级的国际主义精神，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，以狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动，支援法国和欧洲、北美各国以及全世界一切革命人民的革命斗争，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗到底。
