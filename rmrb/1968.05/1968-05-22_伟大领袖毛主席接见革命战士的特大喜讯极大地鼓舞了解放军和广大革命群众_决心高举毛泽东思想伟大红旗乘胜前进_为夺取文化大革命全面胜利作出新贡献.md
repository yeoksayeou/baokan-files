The great news of Chairman Mao, the great leader, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving more than twenty thousand revolutionary soldiers from all over the country has greatly inspired the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and the revolutionary cadres who are bravely advancing and striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the 20th, those who were received by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, including representatives of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Beijing, representatives attending the Second Session of the Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission of the People's Liberation Army and the First Session of the Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, representatives of revolutionary workers attending the conference on revolutionizing and promoting production in coal mines, and cadres of the Military Control Commission, as well as personnel engaged in receiving revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were extremely excited to say that Chairman Mao receiving us is the happiest, most glorious, and most unforgettable event in our lives. It is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest motivation, and greatest support from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao for the military and people of the entire country. They sang enthusiastically "The East Is Red," "The Great Ship Sails on the Ocean," and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," and shouted a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" Each unit waved red flags and shone brightly with lights, holding celebration meetings and discussions throughout the night, with cheers, drumbeats, and firecrackers echoing through the night. Many comrades stayed up all night making phone calls and sending telegrams to report this great news to their units and sharing the greatest happiness with their comrades-in-arms. The revolutionary soldiers firmly declared that they would, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, advance victoriously, develop the good situation, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Beijing have been immersed in unprecedented happiness since they were honored to be received by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. In various Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and the songs of "The Great Ship Sails on the Ocean" and "Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life" echoed throughout the night. Representatives from all over the country, on their way back from the reception and after returning to their stations, told everyone they met, "We saw Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is in extremely good health! This is the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world!" They shouted over and over again, "We saw Chairman Mao! We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!" Many study classes held grand celebration meetings throughout the night. Revolutionary soldiers also took oaths in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, held discussions, put up wall newspapers, and performed artistic programs to express their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. Some representatives stayed up all night by the radio, listening to the live broadcast of Chairman Mao's reception, recalling that exciting and happy moment. The revolutionary soldiers participating in the study class said that Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest concern and expectation from Chairman Mao. They declared that they would, with the fastest actions and the greatest revolutionary spirit, strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to respond to Chairman Mao's concern and expectation. In some regions, representatives of the two factions, after being received by Chairman Mao, sat together that night, humbly made self-criticisms, and reached an agreement on revolutionary great unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives regarded Chairman Mao's reception as a great driving force for them to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and sum up their experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They decided to launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, continue to vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, continue to carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The representatives of the Second Session of the Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission of the People's Liberation Army and the First Session of the Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after being received by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, held celebratory parades on their way back, shouting a thousand and ten thousand times, "We saw Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is in extremely good health! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" Wherever they went, there was a festive atmosphere. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards along the way waved to the representatives and shouted in unison, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" sharing the greatest happiness.

The leadership of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission held celebration meetings and discussions throughout the night. The revolutionary soldiers, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love, belief, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, highly praised the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao and specially spoke of the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting was brightly lit and filled with cheers. The national defense scientific research soldiers, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, with their loyal hearts, made a solemn vow. They said, the leapfrog development of China's national defense scientific research and every achievement in national defense science and technology all shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and are the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will, with Vice Chairman Lin Biao as our shining example, use our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao to guide our lives. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and overthrow and expose the reactionary revisionist scientific research line of slavishness, crawling, and abolitionism advocated by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. We will strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will defend and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for scientific research, which advocates striving for the first place, self-reliance, and striving for strength, setting great aspirations, and making great resolutions to catch up with and surpass the advanced level of world science and technology.

In the Chinese Academy of Sciences, more than ten thousand representatives and revolutionary scientific research soldiers who were received by Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao held a celebration meeting throughout the night. The scientific research soldiers at the meeting declared that they would, under the guidance of the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents' reactionary revisionist line in the academy, and carry the proletarian political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end. They vowed to turn the Chinese Academy of Sciences into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives from various places attending the conference on revolutionizing and promoting production in coal mines, after being received by Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, held enthusiastic celebration activities and discussions on the night of the 20th. The representatives were deeply moved to say that the great commander Chairman Mao led us coal miners from victory to victory, and the great Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the bright future of China's coal industry. Today, in the midst of the victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao warmly received us again. This is the greatest concern and greatest motivation for us coal miners and the greatest concern and greatest motivation for the working class of the whole country. Many representatives, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, said with deep affection, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Everything we coal miners have is given by you. We will, with Vice Chairman Lin Biao as our shining example, forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your thoughts, and forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line." Ten old miners from the coal capital Fushun recalled in the discussion the bitter life of miners being called "pit children" and "coal blackies" by capitalists in the old society and compared it with the happy life today. The more they recalled, the more they felt Chairman Mao's closeness, and the new society's sweetness. The more they compared, the more they hated Liu Shaoqi and the evil old society. They raised their arms and shouted: Defend Chairman Mao to the death! Defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death! A veteran worker from the Datong Coal Mine, who escaped from the "ten thousand graves" where Japanese imperialists massacred Chinese miners, happily saw the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao yesterday. He wrote a pledge to Chairman Mao with great excitement: I will forever remember May 20, 1968, forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, and be a good miner for Chairman Mao. The representatives of the Anshan Coal Mine said excitedly at the discussion meeting: Chairman Mao came to Anshan, entered the workers' dormitories, went down the coal mines, sowed the seeds of revolution, and led the famous Anshan strike. However, Liu Shaoqi shamelessly distorted history and erected monuments for himself, which is extremely reactionary! They declared that they would follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, overthrow and expose Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anshan, and root out the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks to ensure that the socialist state will never change color.

When the representatives attending the conference conveyed the great news of Chairman Mao's reception to various mines, many mining areas such as Benxi, Shuangyashan, Jixi, Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, Datong, Heshang, Jingxing, and Fengfeng held grand celebration activities throughout the night. Many revolutionary workers, inspired by this great news, created outstanding production results. The workers of the Beijing Mining Bureau completed the production plan in excess on the day and the next day Chairman Mao received them. The coal production of the first shift of the Kailuan Coal Mine on the 21st exceeded the previous shift by more than six hundred tons. The revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau completed the daily plan by 20% more after hearing the news of Chairman Mao's reception that day. The daily production of the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau on the 21st was one and a half times more than the usual daily production. Many coal mine workers also carried out revolutionary criticism over these two days, promoting revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary workers declared that they would, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the revolution and promote production, and make new contributions to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
