Implementing Chairman Mao's Great Instructions, Liaoning Has a Bright Future
The Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Are Born with Glory
600,000 Soldiers and Civilians Celebrate, Enthusiastically Shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao, the Reddest Red Sun in Our Hearts!"

In the radiant light of Chairman Mao's latest series of great instructions, under the close care and wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the 28 million revolutionary people of heroic Liaoning Province, after two years of heroic struggle, have won a decisive victory in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries. The Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City have been born in glory amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution!

The birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City is a brilliant victory in the fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. It declares the complete failure of the plot by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning to restore capitalism, and it is a heavy blow to all class enemies at home and abroad. The entire Northeast and North China regions are red, and the overwhelming majority of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have established Revolutionary Committees, creating an unprecedentedly good situation. This will greatly inspire the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians to advance victoriously and achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Liaoning is an important industrial base in our country, with a strategic position of great importance. For a long time, Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning such as Ma Mingfang, Gu Zhuoxin, Yu Ping, and Zhou Huan, have been colluding with traitors, forming cliques, and vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism. During the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, they stubbornly adhered to the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, suppressed revolutionary masses, and attempted to extinguish the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution.

Great Leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have shown great concern for the working class and revolutionary people of Liaoning. At every critical juncture in the Cultural Revolution in Liaoning Province, Chairman Mao has given extremely important instructions. The brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the path of the Cultural Revolution in Liaoning.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the greatest foresight, is most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." In the Cultural Revolution, the working class of Liaoning has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and fully played the role of the main force. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses, they have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," displayed the great fearlessness of the proletariat, and waged resolute struggles against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev, against the remnants of the anti-party alliance of Gao Gang, Rao Shushi, Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, and Zhang Wentian, and against all kinds of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders hidden within the Party. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses, with the full support of the People's Liberation Army, have repeatedly smashed the frenzied counterattacks of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and repeatedly exposed the various tricks and plots of the class enemies, winning one great victory after another.

On May 10, the capital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang City, was immersed in a sea of joy. More than 600,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, facing the morning sun, carrying the giant portrait of Great Leader Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and singing revolutionary songs, surged from all directions to People's Square to enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City.

The celebration began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." The 600,000 revolutionary masses, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao: "The 28 million revolutionary people of Liaoning Province pledge to you: We will forever be loyal to Great Leader Chairman Mao! Forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We vow to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our proletarian revolutionary power will never change color." The meeting solemnly announced the official establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, and the entire venue echoed with thunderous cheers. People shouted over and over again: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On the joyous day of the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, from Shanhaiguan to the Yalu River, from the coast of the Bohai Sea to the plains of Liaoning, songs of victory resounded, and the masses rejoiced. The revolutionary people of the entire province sincerely wished Great Leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

"Soldiers and civilians united as one, who in the world can defeat us?" The broad masses of soldiers and civilians of the People's Liberation Army participating in the celebration were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. At the critical moment of the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians of the Shenyang Military Region and the Liaoning Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, in response to the great call of Great Leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sent tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, and rural communes, and enthusiastically propagated, organized, and armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. They made great contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work. The revolutionary masses participating in the celebration repeatedly shouted: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Salute the People's Liberation Army! Long live the great People's Liberation Army!"

Comrade Chen Xilian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, spoke at the celebration. He said, all the achievements and victories we have gained are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! They are the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Comrade Chen Xilian said, Great Leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the Nationalist reactionaries, and it is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Liaoning Province is located on the front line of national defense, and class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. The handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders within the Party, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will not readily accept their defeat and will certainly make desperate struggles and more cunning and hidden sabotage activities. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, we must firmly grasp the key of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, continue to mobilize the masses, and carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism and struggle. We must take the initiative to launch more fierce attacks on the class enemies, expose and criticize Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism they have spread. We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and resolutely smash the rightist wind of reversal. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, and resolutely suppress those class enemies who brazenly sabotage the Cultural Revolution, sabotage socialist construction, and disrupt social order. We must expose and root out hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

Comrade Chen Xilian said, to thoroughly defeat the class enemies, we must be good at uniting our class forces, uniting and winning over the majority, and distinguishing between enemy and internal contradictions and between the broad revolutionary masses and the few bad elements mixed in the mass organizations, according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We must always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and all class enemies, and never direct it against our class brothers and revolutionary masses, so as to unite the broad revolutionary masses and fight the enemy together. We must further promote revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones in the struggle, and actively promote the establishment of Revolutionary Committees in places where they have not yet been established.

Comrade Chen Xilian said, Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic experience of the Revolutionary Committee is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, representatives of the military, and representatives of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." We must take Comrade Lin as a shining example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and model ourselves after Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to build a revolutionary leadership team for the Revolutionary Committee. Every member of the Revolutionary Committee is a servant of the people and must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, often go among the masses, and maintain close ties with the masses. We must build the Revolutionary Committee into a strong command center that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Chen Xilian finally said, Liaoning Province is an important industrial base in our country, undertaking the glorious task of supporting the socialist construction of the motherland. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," use revolution to lead production, strive to complete and overfulfill the plans for industrial and agricultural production and railroads and transportation, and do all work better. We must hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," believe in and rely on the army, support and help the army, maintain and consolidate the great wall, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians of the army must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their preparedness, and consolidate national defense. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, advance victoriously, and vow to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, making Liaoning Province a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Jiang Yonghui, a responsible comrade of the Shenyang Military Region, on behalf of the stationed soldiers and civilians, warmly congratulated the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. He said, the People's Liberation Army is the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and it is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians of the Shenyang Military Region, Liaoning Military Region, and stationed troops in Liaoning, must hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item. We must humbly learn from the people, warmly love the people, firmly believe in the people, closely rely on the people, resolutely support the leftist broad masses, and forever fight together with the people of the entire province, win together, and advance together! We must wholeheartedly love, firmly support, actively help, and bravely defend the newly born Revolutionary Committees. We must resolutely expose and smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemies to sabotage the Revolutionary Committees.

Comrades Yang Chunfu, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, and Wang Congzhou, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Shenyang City, also spoke at the meeting.

Comrade Wei Fengying, a good worker of Chairman Mao, a representative of the revolutionary masses, and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, spoke at the meeting. She said, we must firmly grasp the key of class struggle and heighten our class vigilance. We must be a hundred times vigilant against the unrepentant capitalist roaders and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries infiltrating the revolutionary ranks; a hundred times vigilant against the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat; a hundred times vigilant against the class enemies using sugar-coated bullets to buy and attack; a hundred times vigilant against the sabotage and disruption by the special agents of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese, and Nationalist bandits; and a hundred times vigilant against the counter-revolutionary two-faced people spreading rumors and inciting trouble to sabotage the newly born proletarian revolutionary power. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and defend with our lives the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the great People's Liberation Army, and the newly born Revolutionary Committees.

Comrades Li Boqiu, Wang Liang, Yang Di, Yang Qi, Mao Yuanxin, Ren Baocheng, Wang Feng'en, Liu Zhongli, Yu Guilan, Zhang Zhiguo, Wei Liling, Hao Yitian, Liu Shengtian, Ling Shaonong, Zhang Fuding, Chen Hexuan, Xiao Zuohan, Shao Zhengtian, Li Fanqing, Li Suwen, Zhang Fuzhi, Zhang Bingxiang, Wu Yude, Song Guomin, Chen Zhenhan, Jie Qidong, Wang Yufen, Yu Lianying, and Yang Jianfa, Vice Chairmen of the Revolutionary Committees of the province and city, and the responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenyang and the Liaoning Military Region attended the celebration. Comrades Pan Fusheng, head of the delegation from Heilongjiang Province, and Wang Huixiang, head of the delegation from Jilin Province, also attended the celebration. Comrades Pan Fusheng and Wang Huixiang both spoke at the meeting.

The meeting, amidst thunderous cheers and applause, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.

    毛主席的伟大指示坚决照办辽宁大有希望
    辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会同时光荣诞生
    六十万军民集会庆祝，热烈欢呼“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！”
    全省军民决心紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，主动地向阶级敌人发起更猛烈的进攻，坚决镇压那些猖狂破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设、扰乱社会治安的阶级敌人，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来。要注意严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。要继续做好广大群众和广大干部的思想政治工作，不断壮大革命队伍，团结和争取同盟军，共同对敌。要进一步抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，在国防、工农业、交通运输等战线上作出更大的贡献。
    新华社沈阳十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀和英明领导下，英雄的辽宁省两千八百万革命人民经过两年来的英勇斗争，赢得了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的决定性胜利。辽宁省和沈阳市的革命委员会，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中光荣诞生了！
    辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会的诞生，是无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线激烈斗争的辉煌胜利，它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北和辽宁的代理人复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，对国内外一切阶级敌人是一个沉重的打击。整个东北和华北地区红成一片，全国大多数省、市、自治区都建立了革命委员会的空前大好形势，必将大大鼓舞亿万军民乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    辽宁是我国重要的工业基地，战略地位极为重要。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在东北和辽宁地区的代理人马明方、顾卓新、喻屏、周桓之流，在这里招降纳叛，结党营私，极力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们为了挽救自己的覆灭命运，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众，妄图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，对辽宁的工人阶级和广大革命人民给了极大的关怀。在辽宁省无产阶级文化大革命的每一个紧要关头，毛主席都作了极其重要的指示。伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了辽宁无产阶级文化大革命的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，辽宁工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，充分发挥了主力军的伟大作用。他们同贫下中农、革命的红卫兵小将和广大革命群众一起，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，发扬无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派，同高岗、饶漱石、彭德怀、黄克诚、张闻天反党联盟的残余分子，同隐藏在党内的形形色色的叛徒、特务和死不悔改的走资派，进行了坚决的斗争。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在人民解放军的全力支持下，一次又一次地粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的疯狂反扑，一次又一次地戳穿了阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，夺得了一个又一个的巨大胜利。
    五月十日，辽宁省省会沈阳市沉浸在欢乐的海洋中。广大革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员六十万人，迎着朝霞，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱革命歌曲，从四面八方涌向人民广场，热烈庆祝辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。六十万革命群众手擎红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向毛主席庄严宣誓：“我们辽宁省两千八百万革命人民，向您宣誓：我们要永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席！永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想！永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，加强无产阶级专政，使我们的无产阶级革命政权永不变色。”大会庄严宣布辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会正式成立时，全场欢声雷动，人们一遍又一遍地纵情高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在欢庆辽宁省革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，从山海关到鸭绿江，从渤海之滨到辽北平原，凯歌高奏，万众欢腾。全省革命人民最衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”参加庆祝大会的人民解放军广大指战员，受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，人民解放军沈阳部队和辽宁省军区广大指战员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，派出成千上万个毛泽东思想宣传队深入工矿、企业、机关、学校和农村人民公社，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众。在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了巨大的贡献。参加庆祝大会的革命群众不断高呼：“向人民解放军学习！”“向人民解放军致敬！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”
    辽宁省革命委员会主任陈锡联同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，我们所取得的一切成就，一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    陈锡联同志说，伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：
  “无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”辽宁省地处国防前线，阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂。党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，决不甘心于他们的失败，必然要作垂死的挣扎，进行更狡猾、更隐蔽的破坏活动。辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会成立以后，必须紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，继续放手发动群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发起更猛烈的进攻，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派和他们在东北、辽宁的代理人，揭深揭透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们散布的反革命修正主义流毒。我们要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风。要百倍提高革命警惕，加强敌情观念，坚决镇压那些猖狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设、扰乱社会治安的阶级敌人，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来。
    陈锡联同志说，我们要彻底战胜阶级敌人，必须善于团结自己的阶级队伍，团结和争取绝大多数人，按照毛主席的教导，严格区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，区别广大革命群众和混入群众组织的极少数坏人。要始终把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人，绝不能把矛头对准自己的阶级兄弟和革命群众，以便团结广大革命群众，共同对敌。我们要在斗争中进一步促进革命大联合、革命三结合，积极推动尚未成立革命委员会的地方早日成立革命委员会。
    陈锡联同志说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”我们一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，模范地执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，搞好革命委员会这个领导班子的革命化。革委会的每一个成员都是人民的勤务员，要相信群众，依靠群众，经常深入群众，密切联系群众，做群众的小学生。要把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚强指挥部。
    陈锡联同志最后说，辽宁省是我国的重要工业基地，担负着支援祖国社会主义建设的光荣任务。我们要进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，用革命统帅生产，努力完成和超额完成工农业生产和铁路、交通运输计划，把各项工作做得更好。我们要高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，相信和依靠解放军，拥护和帮助解放军，维护和巩固伟大的长城，大力加强无产阶级专政。解放军广大指战员，要提高警惕，加强战备观念，巩固国防。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把辽宁省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    沈阳部队负责人江拥辉同志代表驻军指战员热烈祝贺辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会成立。他说，人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民子弟兵，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。我们沈阳部队、辽宁省军区和辽宁驻军广大指战员，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，条条落实毛主席最新指示。我们一定要虚心地学习人民群众，热情地爱护人民群众，坚定地相信人民群众，紧紧地依靠人民群众，坚决支持左派广大群众，永远同全省人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！我们对新生的革命委员会，一定要满腔热情地爱护，坚定不移地支持，积极诚恳地帮助，坚决勇敢地捍卫。对于阶级敌人破坏革命委员会的一切阴谋诡计，我们要坚决揭露，给以粉碎性的打击。
    辽宁省革命委员会副主任、革命领导干部杨春甫同志，沈阳市革命委员会主任王从周同志，也在会上讲了话。
    毛主席的好工人、革命群众代表、辽宁省革命委员会副主任尉凤英同志在会上讲了话。她说，我们一定要把阶级斗争的纲抓得紧紧的，把阶级警惕性提得高高的。我们要百倍警惕死不悔改的走资派以及叛徒、特务、反革命分子钻进革命队伍；百倍警惕没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右等社会渣滓妄想颠覆无产阶级专政的罪恶阴谋；百倍警惕阶级敌人用糖衣炮弹进行收买和攻击；百倍警惕美帝、苏修、日本、蒋匪特务破坏和捣乱；百倍警惕反革命两面派造谣挑拨，破坏新生的无产阶级革命政权。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，保卫伟大的中国人民解放军，保卫新生的革命委员会。
    辽宁省革命委员会副主任李伯秋、王良、杨迪、杨弃、毛远新、任宝成、王凤恩、刘忠礼、于桂兰、张治国、魏礼玲、郝义田、刘盛田同志，沈阳市革命委员会副主任凌少农、张喜登、陈鹤轩、肖佐汉、邵正田、李凡青、李素文、张富芝、张炳香、吴玉德、宋国民、陈振珩、解起东、王玉芬、于连英、杨建发同志和省、市革命委员会的委员，中国人民解放军驻沈阳部队和辽宁省军区的负责同志，出席了庆祝大会。
    以黑龙江省革命委员会主任潘复生同志为首的黑龙江省代表团和以吉林省革命委员会主任王淮湘同志为首的吉林省代表团，出席了庆祝大会。潘复生和王淮湘同志都讲了话。
