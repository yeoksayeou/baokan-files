Inspired by the progressive student movements in Western Europe and North America, 2,000 Swedish university students and youth marched and protested in Stockholm on May 25, demanding reforms to the corrupt education system.

The students set out from a building they had occupied as their headquarters, carrying red flags and marching through the center of Stockholm. They chanted slogans such as, "Down with imperialism!" and "We have the right to rebel!" The protest brought the city center's traffic to a complete standstill.

The students planned to occupy the opera house and the city theater but were met with brutal police suppression. Several students were injured by the police.

The Swedish ruling class was terrified of the student protests and mobilized a large number of police to guard key buildings. The Stockholm radio station reported that the number of police deployed was the highest the city had ever seen.

The New China News Agency reported on May 26 that protests against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam erupted in Liverpool, UK, and Wellington, New Zealand, on May 25.

In Liverpool, UK, 400 people participated in a march and protest. The protesters were mostly students from Liverpool University, Manchester University, Leeds University, and York University. They carried banners supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle and chanted, "Victory to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!" in front of the U.S. Consulate building in Liverpool.

The protesters threw bricks at the windows of the U.S. Consulate, kicked in the doors, and burned an American flag.

The British government sent 200 additional police to suppress the protesters. The protesters bravely fought back against the police, and four people were unjustly arrested.

In Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, more than 70 citizens and students marched and protested at the dock where the U.S. warship "Grider" was moored. Despite the police's brutal obstruction, they held up the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, rushed onto the dock, and chanted slogans such as, "Victory to the Vietnamese people!" and "Down with the U.S. aggressors!" The young students cleverly brought the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam onto the U.S. warship, allowing the heroic flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to fly on the U.S. warship.

    示威者向美国领事馆的窗户掷砖头，踢坏了美国领事馆的大门，还焚烧了一面美国国旗。
