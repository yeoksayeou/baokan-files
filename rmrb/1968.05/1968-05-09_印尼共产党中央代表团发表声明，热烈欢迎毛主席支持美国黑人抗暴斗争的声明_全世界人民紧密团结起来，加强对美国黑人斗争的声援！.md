	New China News Agency, May 8th: The Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation issued a statement signed by the delegation head Yusuf Ajitorop, warmly welcoming Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American Blacks against violence. The title of this statement is: "All the peoples of the world unite closely and strengthen support for the struggle of American Blacks!" The full text is as follows:

	The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, issued a declaration on April 16, 1968, supporting the struggle of American Blacks against violence. Chairman Mao's declaration is not only a powerful support from the Communist Party of China and the 700 million people of China for the just struggle of American Blacks, but it also fully reflects the support of all revolutionary peoples of the world for the just struggle of American Blacks. At the same time, it is a great call to strengthen support for the just struggle of American Blacks by launching attacks on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices.

	The Indonesian Communist Party and the revolutionary people of Indonesia sincerely welcome and wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's extremely important declaration.

	This Marxist-Leninist document has inspired the struggle of American Blacks and pointed out the direction for them. It points out: their struggle is inseparable from the struggle of the laboring white people in the United States and will ultimately end the evil rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie; their struggle is an indispensable part of the struggle of all revolutionary peoples of the world against American imperialism, and is a part of the contemporary world revolution. American Blacks are increasingly aware from their own struggle experience that only through revolutionary violence can they defeat the counter-revolutionary violence of the American monopoly bourgeoisie rulers. Chairman Mao sharply points out: "Martin Luther King is a non-violent advocate, but the American imperialists did not tolerate him for that, but used counter-revolutionary violence to carry out bloody suppression against him." Only through the path of armed violence can the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie be overthrown, and American Blacks and all American laboring people can achieve thorough liberation.

	Chairman Mao has explained that due to political and economic crises enveloping the United States, the situation of American imperialism is extremely difficult both domestically and internationally, and the strength of American Blacks and the revolutionary peoples of the world is extremely powerful. He also pointed out the urgent tasks that the revolutionary peoples of the world must carry out.

	The unprecedented storm of the struggle of American Blacks in American history is a sharp dagger plunged into the heart of American imperialism. It is a great contribution to the world revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out: "It shows that among the more than 20 million American Blacks, there is an extremely powerful revolutionary force." The savage imperialist beast that stretches its claws to the whole world is facing increasingly fierce resistance from the revolutionary peoples of the world. Especially in Vietnam, it is being beaten to a pulp by the heroic and great Vietnamese people's war. Now it cannot even be safe at home, and it is in a state of panic in the face of the blows from the Black struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out very incisively that the struggle of American Blacks "is a great support and encouragement for the struggle of the peoples of the world against American imperialism, and for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism."

	The brave and passionate struggle of American Blacks against the brutal suppression of the American monopoly bourgeoisie reactionaries is a great impetus and support for the struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party and the revolutionary people of Indonesia. The Marxist-Leninists of Indonesia and the revolutionary people of Indonesia, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing along the revolutionary path, waging a protracted war, and waging a people's war to smash the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, the running dogs of American imperialism and the accomplices of Soviet modern revisionism, to establish a people's democratic regime in Indonesia. The armed struggle of the Indonesian people, which has already begun to blaze, is a concrete manifestation of support for the struggle of American Blacks. This flame of struggle will surely burn more fiercely and combine with the flames of struggle of American Blacks and the revolutionary peoples of the world, burning our common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices to ashes!

	Chairman Mao said: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of Blacks, will inevitably come to an end with the thorough liberation of the Black race." Chairman Mao's scientific judgment is being realized by the surging struggle of Blacks combined with the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. We are full of confidence in welcoming the brilliant future as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong: "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off."

	Let us all act together to realize Chairman Mao's great call, unite more closely, and launch a protracted and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices!

	Long live the struggle of American Blacks and all American laboring people!
	Long live the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world!
	Down with American imperialism and its accomplices!
	Long live Mao Zedong Thought, the beacon illuminating the path of struggle for the revolutionary peoples of the world!
	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the most beloved great leader of the revolutionary peoples of the world!

　　印尼共产党中央代表团发表声明，热烈欢迎毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
　　全世界人民紧密团结起来，加强对美国黑人斗争的声援！
    新华社八日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团发表由团长尤素福·阿吉托罗普署名的声明，热烈欢迎毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。这个声明的题目是：《全世界人民紧密团结起来，加强对美国黑人斗争的声援！》全文如下：
    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志在一九六八年四月十六日发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。毛主席的这个声明，不但是中国共产党人和七亿中国人民对美国黑人正义斗争的强大支持，而且也充分反映了全世界革命人民对美国黑人正义斗争的支持。同时，它是一个伟大的号召，号召通过向我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动进攻来加强对美国黑人正义斗争的支持。
    印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民衷心地欢迎和全心全意地支持毛主席的这个极其重要的声明。
    这个马克思列宁主义的文件，鼓舞了美国黑人的斗争并为之指引了方向。它指出：他们的斗争同美国白人中的劳动人民的斗争是分不开的，最后将结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治；他们的斗争是全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义斗争的不可分割的组成部分，是当代世界革命的组成部分。美国黑人从他们自身的斗争经验中日益认识到，只有通过革命的暴力斗争，才能打败美国垄断资产阶级统治者的反革命暴力。毛主席尖锐地指出：“马丁·路德·金是一个非暴力主义者，但美帝国主义者并没有因此对他宽容，而是使用反革命的暴力，对他进行血腥的镇压。”只有通过武装暴力的道路，推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，美国黑人和全体美国劳动人民才能取得彻底的解放。
    毛主席阐明了，由于政治危机和经济危机笼罩着美国，美帝国主义在国内外的处境是何等困难，美国黑人的力量和全世界革命人民的力量是何等强大，并且指出了全世界革命人民斗争必须执行的迫切任务。
    美国历史上空前未有的美国黑人斗争风暴，是深深插进美帝国主义心脏中的一把尖刀。它是对世界革命的巨大贡献。正如毛泽东同志明确指出的那样：“它显示了在两千多万美国黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。”把野蛮的侵略魔爪伸到全世界的巨魔美帝国主义，正在遭到全世界革命人民越来越激烈的反抗。特别是在越南，它正在被英雄和伟大的越南人民的战争打得遍体鳞伤。现在它在自己的家里也不能平安无事，在黑人斗争的打击面前惊慌失措。毛主席极其精辟地指出，美国黑人的斗争“对于全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对于越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是一个巨大的支援和鼓舞。”
    美国黑人反对美国垄断资产阶级反动派统治的残酷镇压的英勇和激昂的斗争，是对印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民斗争的巨大推动和支持。印尼的马克思列宁主义者和印尼革命人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，正沿着革命道路，开展持久战争，开展革命的人民战争来粉碎美帝国主义的看家狗和苏联现代修正主义的同伙苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，以在印尼建立人民民主政权。已经开始燃烧起来的印尼人民武装斗争，是对美国黑人斗争的具体声援的体现。这个斗争的烈火一定会越烧越旺，并和美国黑人以及全世界革命人民的斗争烈火结合起来，把我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们烧得尽光！
    毛主席说：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛主席的这个科学论断，正在被同全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争结合起来的黑人汹涌澎湃的斗争变为现实。我们满怀信心来迎接正如毛泽东同志所指出的光辉灿烂的前途：“殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    让我们一齐行动起来实现毛主席的伟大号召，更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！
    美国黑人和全体美国劳动人民的斗争万岁！
    全世界革命人民的斗争万岁！
    打倒美帝国主义及其帮凶们！
    普照全世界革命人民斗争道路的灯塔毛泽东思想万岁！
    全世界革命人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
