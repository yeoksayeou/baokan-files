The story of the "consulting team" from Gucun Brigade is widely circulated in the villages of Qixia County, Shandong Province's Jiaodong Peninsula. This "consulting team" is composed of six old poor peasants who organized themselves. They are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and infinitely devoted to the socialist collective cause. They enthusiastically help and protect the brigade leadership established during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, going to them to offer suggestions and advice, reflecting the noble qualities of old poor peasants educated by the Party for many years. The following is a fragment of the activities of this "consulting team."

This "string" cannot be loosened

The revolutionary leadership of Gucun Brigade has been established. Brigade cadre Lin Shuxiang thought: Now that we have finally completed the long march of nearly nine thousand nine hundred miles, we should catch our breath; the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters will not cause much trouble like autumn locusts. Now we need to quickly get production going. Thus, he would leave before dawn to lead the villagers up the mountain, working tirelessly with everyone, but his mind gradually loosened the string of class struggle.

The "consulting team" saw this and thought about it. In the evening after work, the six old poor peasants gathered to discuss and then brought the red book to the brigade office.

It was late at night, and the old "consulting team" and Lin Shuxiang sat together for a heart-to-heart talk. Old peasant Lin Xue said: "Shuxiang, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that we must never forget class struggle! Look, why is there grumbling and division after the leadership is established? Why do some people spread rumors and slander? Why do some people try to jump out and engage in speculation? Isn't this the work of a handful of class enemies? The revolutionary situation is getting better every day, but class enemies will not retreat from the stage of history on their own. If we only focus on production and forget to fight against class enemies, we won't be able to hold the reins!"

Lin Xue's words gave Lin Shuxiang a vivid class education lesson. From then on, Lin Shuxiang's mind tightened the string of class struggle again.

Now, when you walk into Gucun Brigade, a "people's war" against class enemies is unfolding before you. From the fields to the households, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. From the white-haired elders to the seven or eight-year-old children, everyone is criticizing and denouncing China's Khrushchev! The masses have been fully mobilized.

Ringing the alarm bell

During the spring plowing production campaign, the brigade leadership held several meetings in the office during the day. The "consulting team" thought: holding a few meetings in the office is a small matter, but if attention is not paid, it will unknowingly lead to the path of detachment from the masses. We must quickly ring the alarm bell and nip it in the bud. Thus, a few old poor peasants went to find the brigade cadres.

Under the lamp, the old "consulting team" and the cadres studied together Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "organizing a revolutionary leadership team that is connected to the masses." Yu Menglin said: "Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed all levels of cadres to closely connect with the masses. This is a major matter of preventing revisionism and preventing changes. Can we blend with the masses or not? This is the dividing line between serving the people and being an official. Recently, I found that you hold meetings in the office during the day. This is the beginning of detachment from the masses. We cannot ignore this problem just because it is small." As soon as Yu Menglin finished speaking, another old peasant said: "Necessary meetings we must hold. I suggest: during the busy season, meetings that can be held in the evening should not be held during the day, and meetings that must be held during the day should be held in the fields. We must pay attention to 'grasp revolution, promote production.'" The sincere criticism and suggestions of the old "consultants" opened the minds of the brigade cadres. They said: This alarm bell is well rung. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and always be with the masses.

Since then, the phenomenon of holding meetings in the office during the day has disappeared. The broad masses of villagers praised: The cadres are with us every day, rolling in the mud, and their hearts are always with us. We trust such cadres.

The study classes became more lively

Chairman Mao said: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." After Chairman Mao's instructions were issued, the brigade followed Chairman Mao's teachings, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents, further promoting agricultural water conservancy construction and preparation for farming.

However, after the busy spring plowing season, the study classes were still held in the old way. Due to the long days and short nights, heavy labor, complex tasks, and scattered personnel, it was not possible to concentrate on holding study classes, which affected the learning effect. The old "consulting team" gathered to study Chairman Mao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, and strengthened their confidence in running good study classes. Old peasant Lin He said: "Chairman Mao's words are the absolute truth. Without proletarian politics in command, production cannot be done well. Now that the busy spring plowing season has arrived, the busier the work, the heavier the tasks, the more we must run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes. No matter how busy, not running Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a waste of time; no matter how much we grasp, not grasping the emphasis on proletarian politics is a waste of effort. Now, if we continue to hold study classes in the old way, it cannot adapt to the characteristics of the busy season. We should help the leadership think of some ideas." The old "consulting team" discussed for a while and then went to discuss with the brigade cadres.

That night, the lights in the brigade office were on until late. The six old peasants and all members of the brigade leadership studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "deciding work policies according to actual conditions, which is the most basic work method that all communists must firmly remember" and the experience of Dazhai in holding study classes according to the characteristics of the busy season. They jointly decided to hold field study classes, family study classes, work team study classes, and professional team study classes. In this way, the study classes in Gucun Brigade became more lively, effectively promoting spring plowing production.

Guiding the villagers to walk the path of "publicness"

As soon as spring plowing began, a strange wind blew in from somewhere, and a few villagers privately made nets and lace during collective labor time, affecting revolution and production.

The "consulting team" of six old peasants discussed this matter: Now that the farm work is so busy, these people ignore the collective work and only care about their own small calculations. This is the poison of China's Khrushchev. Thus, they prepared to find the cadres to discuss this problem. Coincidentally, brigade cadre Lin Shuxiang rushed into the house at this time. It turned out that they also discovered this problem and came to find the "consulting team" to jointly discuss solutions.

The next evening, the brigade cadres and the broad revolutionary masses studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and together criticized the black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev such as "three selfs and one package" and "public-private fusion." This further raised everyone's class consciousness and made everyone realize: During collective labor time, ignoring collective production and busy with personal sideline businesses is the work of "selfishness," which is exactly falling for China's Khrushchev's trap.

Since then, everyone has cared about collective production and labor, and the entire brigade has presented a great scene of revolution and production.

    他们最关心革命
    ——古村大队六个老贫农帮助和爱护大队新领导班子的故事
    在山东胶东半岛的栖霞县观里公社，到处流传着古村大队“参谋队”的故事。这个大队的“参谋队”是由六个老贫农自动组织起来的。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，对社会主义集体事业无限热爱。他们满腔热情地帮助和爱护在无产阶级文化大革命中建立起来的大队领导班子，找上门去提意见，出主意，一举一动都反映出受党多年教育的老贫农的高贵品质。下面记述的就是这个“参谋队”活动的片断。
      这根“弦”不能松
    古村大队的革命领导班子建立起来了。大队干部林书香想：现在总算万里长征走完了九千九，该松口气了；党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神，象秋后的蚂蚱，成不了什么大气候，现在就是要赶快把生产搞上去。于是，他天不亮就带着社员上山，没白没黑地和大家在一起滚泥巴，可脑子里阶级斗争的“弦”却慢慢地松开了。
    这情况，“参谋队”看在眼里，想在心里。晚上收工回来，六个老贫农凑在一起盘算了会儿，便捧上红彤彤的宝书来到大队办公室。
    夜深了，老“参谋队”和林书香在促膝谈心。老贫农林学说：“书香啊，咱可要牢记毛主席他老人家千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导啊！你看，为什么领导班子成立后有人嘀嘀咕咕闹分裂？为什么有人明里暗里散布流言蜚语？为什么有个别的人又企图跳出来大搞投机倒把活动？这不是一小撮阶级敌人在搞鬼吗！？革命形势一天比一天好，阶级敌人不会自行退出历史舞台。如果咱只顾抓生产，忘记了和阶级敌人斗，这印把子攥不住啊！”林学的一席话，给林书香上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。从此，林书香脑子里阶级斗争的“弦”又绷紧了。
    现在，走到古村大队时，一场向阶级敌人进攻的“人民战争”展现在你的面前。从田间到家庭，到处都是革命大批判的战场。从白发苍苍的老人到七、八岁的儿童，人人口诛笔伐，向中国的赫鲁晓夫开炮！群众充分发动起来了。
        敲警钟
    在春耕生产的热潮中，大队领导班子利用白天时间在办公室里开了几次会。“参谋队”认为：在办公室开几次会是小事，但是如果不提起注意，就会不知不觉地走向脱离群众的道路，必须迅速敲警钟，防微杜渐。于是，几位老贫农来找大队干部。
    灯下，老“参谋队”和干部一起学习了毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示。于孟林说：“毛主席他老人家一再教导各级领导干部要密切联系群众，这是防修防变的大事啊！能不能和群众打成一片，这是为人民服务还是当官做老爷的分界线。最近，俺发现你们白天在办公室里开会，这就是脱离群众的苗头。不能因为这个问题不大，就不去注意。”于孟林的话音刚落，另一个老贫农接着说：“必要的会咱一定要开。我建议：在大忙季节能晚上开的会就不要放在白天开，白天需要开的会最好在田间开。我们一定要注意‘抓革命，促生产’。”老“参谋”的诚恳批评和建议，使大队干部的思想开了八面窗，豁地亮了。他们说：这次警钟敲得好，我们一定要听毛主席的话，永远和群众在一起。
    打这以后，白天在办公室里开会的现象不见了。广大社员夸奖说：干部和咱们天天在一起滚泥巴，心也时刻和咱们贴在一起，这样的干部我们就是信得过。
      学习班更活跃了
    毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”毛主席指示下达后，大队遵照毛主席的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班，并向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发起了猛烈进攻，进一步推动了农田水利建设和备耕工作。
    可是，春耕大忙后，学习班还是照老办法办，由于日长夜短、劳动强度大、工种复杂、人员分散，集中办学习班就不能适应农忙的特点，学习效果受到影响。老
  “参谋队”凑在一起，学习毛主席有关突出无产阶级政治的指示，坚定了办好学习班的信心。老贫农林合说：“毛主席他老人家的话是千真万确的真理，无产阶级政治不挂帅，生产就搞不好。现在春耕大忙季节来到了，活越忙、任务越重，越要办好毛泽东思想学习班。千忙万忙，不抓毛泽东思想学习班是瞎忙；千抓万抓，不抓突出无产阶级政治是瞎抓。眼下再照老办法办学习班，不能适应农忙的特点，咱们得帮助领导班子多想想点子。”老“参谋队”你一言，我一语，商议了一阵子，就去找大队干部商量。
    这天晚上，大队办公室的灯光亮到深夜。六个老贫农和大队领导班子全体成员一起认真学习了毛主席关于“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法”的教导，和大寨根据农忙特点办学习班的经验。他们共同确定分别办田头学习班、家庭学习班、作业组学习班、专业队学习班等。这样，古村大队的学习班更活跃了，有力地推动了春耕生产。
  引导社员走“公”字的路
    春耕一开始，不知从那里吹来了一股风，有少数社员在集体劳动时间私自在家编网包、织花边，以致影响了革命和生产。
      “参谋队”六个老贫农议论起这事：眼下农活这么忙，这些人放着集体的活不去干，只顾拨拉自己的小算盘，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。于是，便准备找干部研究这个问题。说也巧，大队干部林书香就在这时一头闯进屋里来，原来他们也发现了这个问题，他是来找“参谋队”共同研究解决的办法的。
    第二天晚上，大队干部和广大革命群众一起学习了毛主席“要斗私，批修”和“备战、备荒、为人民”等有关教导，一起批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”“公私溶化”等黑货，进一步提高了大家的阶级觉悟，使大家认识到：在集体劳动时间内放着集体生产不管，忙着去搞个人的小副业，是“私”字作怪，正是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当。
    从那以后，人人关心集体生产劳动，全队革命、生产呈现出一派大好景象。
