The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on May 25, stating that the burgeoning worker and student revolutionary movements in France, Western Europe, and North America have dealt a heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism and the reactionary rulers of these countries. It has greatly encouraged and supported the revolutionary struggles of the Thai people and the people of the world.

The commentary said that the massive worker and student revolutionary movements that have erupted in the heart of the capitalist world reflect the sharp class struggles and the intensifying fundamental contradictions in these countries. This revolutionary movement will inevitably drive the people's revolutionary struggles in this region and around the world to greater heights, thereby hastening the doom of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries.

The commentary pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has spread Mao Zedong Thought widely, greatly encouraging all revolutionary people of the world. The recent vigorous worker and student revolutionary movements in France, Western Europe, and North America are the result of the profound influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. It demonstrates the invincible might of Mao Zedong Thought.

The commentary concluded by expressing that the Thai people firmly support the just struggles of the workers and students in France, Western Europe, and North America. They are determined to unite closely with the revolutionary people of these regions and all revolutionary people of the world, strengthen armed struggle, and launch a persistent and ferocious attack on U.S.-led imperialism and all reactionary forces.
