Japanese revolutionary workers have enthusiastically hailed the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The "Notice" has given great encouragement to revolutionary people around the world. "Long Week News" says that people around the world have drawn great strength from the Chinese Cultural Revolution to fight against imperialism and revisionism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 19, Japanese revolutionary workers spoke to a Chinese reporter, enthusiastically hailing the second anniversary of the issuance of the epoch-making great document—the May 16, 1966, "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally directed by Chairman Mao. They warmly hailed the great inspirational role played by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, in the struggle of the revolutionary people of Japan and the world.

A worker from a meter factory in Tokyo, Mizuno, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally led by Chairman Mao, is not only related to the future of China but also to the future of the world revolution. If it were not for the great leader Chairman Mao, who brilliantly and wisely solved the problem of continuing the revolution under socialist conditions both in theory and practice, and initiated this great political revolution in China, smashing the plots of the class enemies to restore capitalism, not only would China's history have regressed, but the world revolution would also have lost its direction.

Mizuno said that every piece of good news about the victories of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gives boundless encouragement to those who are fighting for the Japanese revolution. He said, the revolutionary people of Japan look towards Chairman Mao and Beijing.

Mizuno said that the "Notice" personally directed by Chairman Mao two years ago is not only a weapon for the revolutionary people of China to defeat class enemies but also a weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat class enemies. It is precisely Chairman Mao's profound analysis of the enemies of the Chinese proletariat that has opened our eyes, enabling us to further recognize the counter-revolutionary nature of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique, and rise up to rebel against them.

Mizuno said that contemporary Marxism-Leninism at its highest level—Mao Zedong Thought—illuminates the path forward for the revolutionary people of Japan. He expressed his determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise class consciousness, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against the influence of Japanese revisionists on the workers' movement.

A worker from an electric power company, Hiroshi, said that the victory of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired the working class of Japan and the world, making us deeply feel the greatness of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, we love Chairman Mao and respect Mao Zedong Thought without limit. We must arm ourselves and all revolutionary people with Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we ensure the victory of the Japanese revolution.

A union worker from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Matsumoto, said that the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses of China, under the guidance of the great "Notice" personally directed by Chairman Mao, have achieved brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing victoriously in complete accordance with the direction indicated by the great "Notice" personally directed by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is completely correct.

Matsumoto pointed out that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has extremely profound and great significance for the international communist movement and the world revolution. He said, the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. We must smash the bourgeois state apparatus and establish proletarian dictatorship. Even after establishing proletarian dictatorship, we must continue class struggle and revolution to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. He said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class struggle, whether now in a capitalist society or after seizing power in the future.

Matsumoto said that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has enabled us to see more clearly the counter-revolutionary nature of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique. He said, the working class of Japan must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overthrow American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists, and the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique. Only in this way can we achieve the victory of the Japanese revolution.

A young electrician in Tokyo, Shinzō, said that the "Notice" personally directed by Chairman Mao is an epoch-making document of great historical significance. He said, Chairman Mao timely summarized the experience of the international proletarian dictatorship and proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles for continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. He personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the plots of the class enemies hiding within the party to restore capitalism, ensuring that China will never change color. This has given the world proletariat boundless confidence and hope.

Shinzō pointed out that the new power organs established in the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the revolutionary committees that implement the "three-in-one combination"—completely represent the fundamental interests of the laboring people.

He said, in the Soviet Union, due to the usurpation of power by the Khrushchev clique, the working class has once again fallen into a position of being exploited and oppressed. Losing power means losing everything.

A postal worker from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Nagatomi, said that the "Notice," this epoch-making great historical document, is the battle cry for the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses of China to fight against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. He said, at a critical moment when international revisionist trends are rampant, the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, personally directed the drafting of this brilliant "Notice," bringing great encouragement to the working class and oppressed people of the world.

Nagatomi said, Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, and he has made great contributions to the development of human history. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. He expressed his determination to forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and dedicate himself to the revolutionary cause of Japan.

A bus driver, Shinohara, said, Chairman Mao trusts the people and relies on the people the most. The great mass movement of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has once again proven that Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history" is a great truth.

Shinohara said, the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had an extremely broad and profound influence among the working class of Japan. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly being accepted by the working class of Japan, and they are gradually recognizing that only by relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought can the workers' movement of Japan advance towards victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 16, the Japanese newspaper "Long Week News" published an article on May 15 commemorating the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16, 1966, "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally directed by Chairman Mao. The article hailed the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saying that it "has immeasurable great significance for the world revolution."

The article said that the great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the drafting of the programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the "Notice," which is a great historical document. It summarized the experience of class struggle in socialist countries under proletarian dictatorship and the historical experience of international proletarian dictatorship, clearly proposing the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article pointed out that this great historical document creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving the problem of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship.

The article said that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is approaching all-around victory. Practice has increasingly proven that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has immeasurable great significance for the world revolution.

The article said that people around the world enthusiastically hail the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao. This victory has increased the confidence of the people of the world in their revolutionary future a hundredfold and has drawn great strength from it to fight against imperialism and revisionism.

    日本革命工人热情欢呼毛主席的伟大战略部署取得辉煌胜利
    《通知》给世界革命人民巨大鼓舞
    《长周新闻》说世界人民从中国文化大革命中汲取了反帝反修的伟大力量
    据新华社东京十九日电　日本革命工人对中国记者发表谈话，热情欢呼在毛主席亲自主持下制定的划时代的伟大文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命对日本和全世界的革命人民的斗争所起的鼓舞作用。
    东京一位仪表厂的工人水野说，毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅关系到中国的前途，而且关系到世界革命的前途。如果不是伟大领袖毛主席天才地、英明地从理论上和实践上解决了社会主义条件下必须继续进行革命的问题，在中国发动了这场伟大的政治大革命，粉碎了阶级敌人企图复辟资本主义的阴谋，那么不仅中国的历史将要倒退，而且世界革命也将会失去方向。
    水野说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利喜讯，都给正在为日本革命而斗争的人们以无限鼓舞。他说，日本革命人民心向着毛主席，向着北京。
    水野说，毛主席两年前亲自主持制定的《通知》，不仅是中国革命人民战胜阶级敌人的武器，而且是世界革命人民战胜阶级敌人的武器。正是毛主席对中国无产阶级的敌人进行的深刻分析，擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们进一步认清日共宫本修正主义集团和苏联现代修正主义领导集团的反革命本质，从而起来造它们的反。
    水野说，当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，照耀着日本革命人民前进的道路。他表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，提高阶级觉悟，以毛泽东思想为武器，为肃清日本修正主义者对工人运动的影响而斗争。
    电力公司工人广中说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，大大地鼓舞了日本和全世界的工人阶级，使我们更加深刻地体会到毛主席和毛泽东思想的伟大。他说，我们无限热爱毛主席，无限敬仰毛泽东思想。我们必须用毛泽东思想武装自己和全体革命人民，只有这样才能保证日本革命的胜利。
    山口县一位工会工作者松本说，中国无产阶级和广大革命群众，在伟大的毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》的指引下，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。中国无产阶级文化大革命完全按照毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》所指引的方向胜利前进，毛主席的伟大战略部署是完全正确的。
    松本指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命对国际共产主义运动和世界革命具有极其深远的伟大意义。他说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们必须粉碎资产阶级的国家机构，建立无产阶级专政。而在建立了无产阶级专政以后，也要继续进行阶级斗争、进行革命，巩固无产阶级专政。他说，我们要遵照毛主席的教导，无论现在在资本主义社会里，或者将来夺取了政权之后，都不能忘记阶级斗争。
    松本说，中国无产阶级文化大革命使我们进一步看清了日共宫本修正主义集团的反革命本质。他说，日本工人阶级必须以毛泽东思想为武器，打倒美帝国主义、日本反动派，打倒苏修和日共宫本修正主义集团，只有这样才能取得日本革命的胜利。
    东京的一位青年电工新傺说，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》是一个划时代的具有伟大历史意义的文献。他说，毛主席及时总结了国际无产阶级专政的经验，提出了在无产阶级专政条件下必须继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，并且亲自发动了无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了隐藏在党内的阶级敌人企图复辟资本主义的阴谋，保证了中国永不变色，这使世界无产阶级产生了无限的信心和希望。
    新傺指出，在中国无产阶级文化大革命中新建立的实行革命“三结合”的权力机构——革命委员会，完全代表了劳动人民的根本利益。
    他说，在苏联，由于赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺了政权，工人阶级又重新处于被剥削、被压迫的地位。失去了政权就失去了一切。
    山口县的邮电工人永富说，《通知》这一划时代的伟大历史文献，是中国无产阶级和广大革命群众在社会主义条件下，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级进行战斗的进军号角。他说，在国际修正主义思潮泛滥的紧要关头，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定了这个光辉的《通知》，给全世界工人阶级和被压迫人民带来了巨大鼓舞。
    永富说，毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖，他对人类历史的发展做出了伟大贡献。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。他表示要永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远照毛主席的教导办事，为日本的革命事业而献身。
    公共汽车司机篠原说，毛主席最相信群众、依靠群众。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大群众运动再一次证明了毛主席关于“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”的这一教导是一个伟大的真理。
    篠原说，中国无产阶级文化大革命在日本工人阶级中间有着极其广泛和深刻的影响。毛泽东思想越来越被日本工人阶级所接受，他们逐步地认识到只有靠伟大的毛泽东思想才能使日本的工人运动胜利向前发展。
    新华社东京十六日电日本《长周新闻》十五日发表文章，纪念毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命
  “对世界革命具有不可估量的伟大意义”。
    文章说，伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件——《通知》，是一个伟大的历史文献，它总结了无产阶级专政下的社会主义国家的阶级斗争经验和国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，明确地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。
    文章指出，这个伟大的历史文件创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的问题。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在迎接全面胜利。实践越来越充分地证明了中国无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命具有不可估量的伟大意义。
    文章说，世界人民热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得的胜利。这一胜利使世界人民对他们的革命前途增加了百倍信心，并从中汲取了进行反帝反修斗争的伟大力量。
