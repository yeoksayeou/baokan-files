Eight thousand students at the University of Chile announce indefinite strike

They declare that they will follow the example of French students and rebel!

	NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) — According to a report from Santiago, approximately eight thousand students at the Faculty of Philosophy and Education at the University of Chile announced an indefinite strike on May 24 to protest the school authorities' reactionary measures against progressive teachers.

	According to the report, the University of Chile's Administrative Council, under the manipulation of reactionary forces, recently passed a resolution to reorganize the Faculty of Philosophy and Education. The political purpose of this resolution is to drive progressive teachers out of their current positions, implementing political persecution.

	The students firmly oppose this resolution and have declared an indefinite strike to support the progressive teachers. At the same time as announcing the strike, the students occupied the buildings of the 23 colleges affiliated with the university and the television and radio stations. The striking students said: "It is time for students to take concrete measures to stop the reactionary bourgeoisie from ruling our university. We will continue our strike and occupy the university buildings until we defeat the extreme right-wing elements ruling the university." The students also said: "We will follow the example of French students! Our rebellion is justified!"

	According to the report, the president of the University of Chile, Eugenio González Rojas, has resigned due to disagreements with the resolution passed by the University Administrative Council, thereby expressing his sympathy and support for the students' just struggle.

    抗议学校当局迫害进步教师的反动措施
    智利八千大学生宣布不定期罢课
    他们表示要以法国大学生为榜样起来造反！
    新华社二十五日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利大学哲学教育学院约八千名大学生二十四日宣布不定期罢课，抗议学校当局采取迫害进步教师的反动措施。
    据报道，智利大学校务委员会最近在反动势力的操纵下，通过了一项改组哲学教育学院的决议，而这项决议的政治目的是要把这个学院的进步教师排挤出他们现在的岗位，实行政治迫害。
    大学生坚决反对这项决议，并以宣布不定期罢课来支持进步教师。大学生们在宣布罢课的同时，占领了这个大学所属二十三个学院的校舍和电视广播台。罢课的学生说：“已经到了大学生采取具体措施来阻止反动资产阶级统治我们大学的时候了。我们举行罢课，占领大学校舍，将一直坚持到打败统治大学的极右分子为止。”学生们还说：“我们要以法国大学生为榜样！我们造反有理！”
    据报道，智利大学校长欧亨尼奥·冈萨雷斯·罗哈斯由于对大学校务委员会通过的这项决议有分歧，已经提出辞职，以此表示对大学生正义斗争的同情和支持。
