Approximately one thousand revolutionary workers, students, and youths held a rally in Tokyo on the 20th to enthusiastically celebrate the release of the new Japanese translation of Volume 1 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The rally was organized by the General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine).

At the rally, Yasuyuki Yasui, a Standing Committee member of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), delivered a speech. He said, "Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an infinite force, a spiritual atomic bomb of immense power. We are determined to study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, to apply them actively, and to focus on the 'use' of them, to persist in the struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism."

Following this, the renowned philosopher Kazuto Matsumura delivered a speech titled "The Great Significance of Mao Zedong Thought in the Contemporary World." He pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. The people of the world, including the Japanese people, must seriously study Chairman Mao's works in their revolutionary struggles. Chairman Mao's works are the most brilliant examples of the unity of theory and practice. We must actively apply Chairman Mao's stand, viewpoint, and method to the practical struggles of the Japanese revolution.

A member of the Japanese Revolutionary Theater Group, Kikuchi Seishu, shared his experiences in actively applying Chairman Mao's works at the rally. He said, "To truly serve the revolution of Japan through art, we must firmly stand on the revolutionary literary and artistic line of Chairman Mao and engage in creation."

After the rally, the Chinese film "South and North Campaigns" was screened.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on the 21st, approximately one thousand revolutionary people in Yamaguchi Prefecture recently held rallies to enthusiastically celebrate the release of the new Japanese translation of Volume 1 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." All attendees expressed their determination to persist in studying Chairman Mao's works and to strive to combine Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution, fighting for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

At the rally held on the 18th, Shigeru Furutani, a representative of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered a speech. He enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought as the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, and lauded Chairman Mao as the great leader who creatively and comprehensively inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism. Furutani said, "The 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' is the crystallization of the universal truths of world revolution. The publication of the Japanese translation of Volume 1 of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' is the most precious gift that the Chinese people have given to the Japanese people. We should launch a new high tide of actively applying Chairman Mao's works."

Furutani said, "As Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, pointed out, we study Mao Zedong Thought for the purpose of applying it. Therefore, the most important thing is to apply Mao Zedong Thought to the practical struggles of the Japanese revolution, to constantly transform ourselves and the world, and to strive for the thorough victory of the Japanese revolution."

The renowned historian and professor at Kyoto University, Kiyoshi Inoue, gave a report at the rally. He said that the practical struggles of the proletarian revolution worldwide and the struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations for liberation have proven that as long as one adheres to the great Mao Zedong Thought, one will surely achieve victory.

Inoue emphasized, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to resolve issues through war.' 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is a great truth applicable everywhere. The most important task for the Japanese people today is to overthrow American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries and to establish a people's government of their own."

The Chairman of the Yamaguchi Regional Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Hiroshi Tsuda, the Director of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Takeo Konoya, and Professor Takayoshi Uetsu of Yamaguchi University delivered speeches at the rally.

The cultural warriors of the Japanese Revolutionary Theater Group, Gearza, performed new revolutionary cultural programs to celebrate the release of the new Japanese translation of Volume 1 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": "Enthusiastically Hail Chairman Mao's Statement Supporting the Struggle of American Blacks Against Violence" and "The Three Constantly Read Articles," which were warmly received by the attendees.

    毛主席把马列主义发展到崭新的阶段
    决心把毛泽东思想用到日本革命实践中去，为日本革命胜利而奋斗
    新华社二十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：约有一千名革命工人、学生和青年二十日在东京举行集会，热烈庆祝《毛泽东选集》第一卷日文版新译本在日本发行。
    集会是由日中友好协会（正统）总部主持的。
    日中友好协会（正统）常务理事安井正幸在会上发表讲话说：“毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想阶段。毛泽东思想一旦为广大群众所掌握，就会变为无穷无尽的力量，变成具有无比威力的精神原子弹。我们决心带着问题学习毛主席著作，活学活用，在‘用’字上狠下功夫，坚持日本人民的反美斗争。”
    接着，著名哲学家松村一人发表了题为《毛泽东思想在当代的重大意义》的讲话。他指出，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。包括日本人民在内的世界人民必须在自己的革命斗争中认真学习毛主席的著作。毛主席的著作是理论与实践相结合的最光辉的典范。我们必须把毛主席的立场、观点和方法活学活用到日本革命的实际中去。
    日本革命剧团齿轮座的团员日笠世志夫在会上介绍了他活学活用毛主席著作的经验。他说：为了使文艺真正为日本的革命服务，我们必须坚定地站在毛主席的革命文艺路线的立场上来从事创作。
    会后放映了中国影片《南征北战》。
    据新华社东京二十一日电　日本山口县革命人民约一千人最近分别举行集会，热烈庆祝《毛泽东选集》第一卷日文版新译本在日本发行。全体与会者表示，坚持学习毛主席著作，努力把毛泽东思想同日本革命的具体实践结合起来，为日本革命的胜利而奋斗。
    在十八日举行的集会上，日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）代表古谷庄一郎发表讲话，热情赞扬毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，伟大领袖毛主席创造性地、全面地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义。古谷说，《毛泽东选集》是世界革命的普遍真理的结晶。《毛泽东选集》第一卷日文版的出版，是中国人民赠送给日本人民的最宝贵的礼物。我们应当掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    古谷说，正如毛主席的最亲密战友林彪副主席指出的那样，学习毛泽东思想是为了用而学。因此，最重要的是，我们应当把毛泽东思想运用到日本革命的实践中去，不断地改造自己，改造世界，争取日本革命的彻底胜利。
    著名历史学家、京都大学教授井上清，在集会上作了报告。他说，全世界无产阶级的革命斗争和全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争的实践证明，只要遵循伟大的毛泽东思想，就一定会取得胜利。
    井上强调说，毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是放之四海而皆准的伟大真理。今天日本人民的最重要的任务是打倒美帝国主义和日本反动派，建立人民自己的政权。
    日中友好协会（正统）山口地区总部理事长津田浩俊、日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部事务局长古野竹则和山口大学教授上妻隆荣等分别在集会上讲了话。
    日本革命剧团齿轮座的文艺战士们，为庆祝《毛泽东选集》第一卷日文版新译本在日本发行，在会上演出了新排练的革命文艺节目：《热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》和《老三篇》，受到到会群众的热烈欢迎。
