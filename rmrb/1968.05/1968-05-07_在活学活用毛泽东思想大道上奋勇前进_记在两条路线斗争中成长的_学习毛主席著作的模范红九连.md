In the great new era when the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, in the stormy struggle between two lines, two classes, and two roads, thousands and tens of thousands of activists and advanced collectives who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought have emerged throughout the country and the army. The Red Ninth Company of a certain regiment in the Shenyang Military Region is a prominent example.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school." Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, gave high praise to the Red Ninth Company during his inspection of the troops. Vice Chairman Lin said: "A good company is a school, and the Ninth Company is a good school."

The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company actively responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's battle cry to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought" and have persistently studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought for many years, creating one good experience after another in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and fostering batch after batch of revolutionary soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao. Since the creation of the Four Good Companies movement in 1961, the Red Ninth Company has been evaluated as a Four Good Company every year; in July 1964, it was named by the Ministry of Defense as the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Ninth Company raised the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level. They closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On the front line of the sharp and complex class struggle, they used Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad leftist masses, establishing new merits for the people.

"The correct political and military line is not produced and developed peacefully and naturally, but is produced and developed through struggle." The Red Ninth Company began studying Chairman Mao's works in 1959, and it has been eight years now. These past eight years have been eight years of striving to study Mao Zedong Thought, and also eight years of struggle against Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing. The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company, who are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, weathering storms and waves.

Responding to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought surged forward.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, blazing a broad path for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the Red Ninth Company was initiated under Vice Chairman Lin's call.

Before 1959, for a period of time, the great conspirator, great schemer, and counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Dehuai vigorously promoted a bourgeois military line, pushing so-called "regularization," "modernization," and systematic education, and fiercely opposing the broad cadre and soldiers studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to change the nature of our army.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, presided over by our great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly smashed Peng Dehuai's counter-revolutionary revisionist plot to seize the military and oppose the Party, and decided that Vice Chairman Lin would take charge of the Military Commission. Not long after Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the Military Commission, he published the important article "Raise High the Banner of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong's Military Thought and March Forward." Vice Chairman Lin thoroughly criticized Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line and bravely defended the great Mao Zedong Thought. In this article, Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Seriously studying Marxism-Leninism theory and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, establishing a proletarian worldview, is the duty of every cadre and Communist Party member in our army."

Seeing these lines of shining gold, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company were filled with joy and inspiration. The Party branch began to organize the backbone of the company to study Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and other brilliant works. Revolutionary soldiers studied Chairman Mao's works and from the bottom of their hearts felt an extremely deep proletarian affection for Mao Zedong Thought.

In October 1960, Vice Chairman Lin personally presided over the drafting of the resolution of the enlarged Military Commission meeting, which has great significance in the history of our army's construction. The resolution called for "raising high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought," requiring all cadres and soldiers to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. The resolution reached the Red Ninth Company, and the entire company read it over and over again, the deeper they read, the deeper their proletarian feelings became. Everyone said: The resolution of the enlarged Military Commission meeting spoke our hearts, it set our direction. The Red Ninth Company, like all companies in the army, under the inspiration of Vice Chairman Lin's battle cry, launched a surge of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Cadres and soldiers rushed to buy Chairman Mao's works, copied Chairman Mao's works, and studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, growing happily under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers expressed their feelings in poetry: "Carefully read 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' each word is a lamp, illuminating my heart, advancing without end."

When the wind rises from the earth, the bones of the dead will stir. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, who inherited Peng Dehuai's legacy, hated and feared the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the troops. He used his stolen important position to wave the "red flag" against the red flag, blowing cold winds and singing counter-revolutionary tunes everywhere, attempting to pour a bucket of cold water on the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing came to the unit where the Red Ninth Company was stationed. As soon as this guy got off the car, he shouted everywhere that "we can't just rely on books to train soldiers," and regulated "seven hours of training per day, the rest of the time for cleaning weapons and shooting practice," not giving the troops time to study Chairman Mao's works. He also insinuated and cursed those who actively studied Chairman Mao's works, vigorously obstructing and destroying the troops' study of Chairman Mao's works.

In the days when the counter-current came, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company repeatedly studied the resolutions of the Gutian Meeting and the enlarged Military Commission meeting, repeatedly pondering this question. We have already suffered enough from Peng Dehuai's promotion of the bourgeois military line, and we have just tasted the sweetness of Vice Chairman Lin's call to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Luo Ruiqing does not allow us to read Chairman Mao's books, and our cadres and soldiers absolutely will not agree!

The Red Ninth Company is a Red Army company personally established by Chairman Mao, fighting alongside Chairman Mao from the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the struggles on Jinggangshan. During the Long March, the Red Ninth Company marched with the Central Red Army for 25,000 li, never leaving Chairman Mao's side. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Mao pointed east with his hand, and the Red Ninth Company, under the direct command of Comrade Lin Biao, participated in the famous Battle of Pingxingguan, earning the glorious title of "Pingxingguan Battle Assault Company." During the War of Liberation, the Red Ninth Company fought north and south, far from Chairman Mao across mountains and rivers, but their hearts never left Chairman Mao's side, always advancing from victory to victory under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company reviewed the company's glorious history of fighting alongside Chairman Mao, filled with passion, said: "Decades ago, we lived because of Chairman Mao, and for decades, we have grown because of Chairman Mao. With Chairman Mao, there is the Red Ninth Company! We, the Red Ninth Company, are forever Chairman Mao's Red Ninth Company! Chairman Mao's books we must read now, we must read in the future, we must read forever, and pass it down from generation to generation."

The firm belief in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought inspired the cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company. They stood firm on the front line of Mao Zedong Thought, unshakable!

Luo Ruiqing did not allow the reading of Chairman Mao's books, but the comrades of the Red Ninth Company insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They organized cadres and soldiers to discuss the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works. Cadres and soldiers deeply felt: "We must train soldiers with Chairman Mao's books, and fight the revolution with Mao Zedong Thought."

Luo Ruiqing did not allow the troops time to study Chairman Mao's works, but the Party branch of the Red Ninth Company specially made a regulation to use fixed time to study Chairman Mao's works and ensure it was unshakable.

Luo Ruiqing viciously slandered and cursed those who actively studied Chairman Mao's works. The Red Ninth Company cultivated and set up activists who studied Chairman Mao's works, publicizing their advanced deeds. The Party branch insisted on developing Party members from activists who studied Chairman Mao's works and promoting cadres from activists who studied Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that the company's leadership was always in the hands of those loyal to Chairman Mao. The Red Ninth Company relied on Mao Zedong Thought, time and again resisting the pressure from Luo Ruiqing, making his plots one after another fail.

In the summer of 1961, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin came to the unit where the Red Ninth Company was stationed. Vice Chairman Lin was very concerned about the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the troops and successively met with the leading cadres of this unit and the company commander Sun Cai and others, carefully understanding the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works in the troops. When Vice Chairman Lin heard that the cadres and soldiers were enthusiastically reading Chairman Mao's books, he was very happy. After listening to the report, Vice Chairman Lin made a very important instruction. Vice Chairman Lin said: "A good company is a school, and the Ninth Company is a good school." When Vice Chairman Lin's instruction reached the company, the entire company cheered and jumped, tears of excitement welling up in their eyes: Beloved Vice Chairman Lin, in the past war years, we grew and fought under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and your personal command; when we were poisoned by the bourgeois military line, it was you who instructed us to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, making us advance correctly on the course of Mao Zedong Thought; now, when our study and application of Mao Zedong Thought are obstructed and destroyed, you have given us an immense force. The entire company spoke with one voice: Taking Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever waving on the battlefield of the Red Ninth Company!

Resisting the impact of the bourgeois military line, always putting the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Emphasizing political construction of the army is Chairman Mao's consistent thought. Vice Chairman Lin Biao faithfully executed Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, proposing a series of principles and policies for emphasizing political construction of the army, such as studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, highlighting proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, carrying forward the Three-Eighths style, promoting the Three Great Democracies, and creating Four Good Companies. Under the guidance of these principles and policies, the mass movement of studying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire army surged higher and higher, the revolutionary construction of the troops presented a new look, and the new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought were growing vigorously. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the Red Ninth Company was also developing vigorously. Just at this time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing jumped out again to stir up trouble, peddling the reactionary fallacy of "military first" everywhere, shouting "military is politics," and stirring up a reactionary tide of large-scale military exercises. This reactionary tide seriously impacted the proletarian ideological front line of the troops. The Red Ninth Company stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the face of this counter-current, always putting the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, firmly grasping the ideological transformation of people, and withstanding the evil winds blown by Luo Ruiqing.

The Party branch of the Red Ninth Company first grasped the cadres' study and application of Chairman Mao's works, raising the cadres' awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, making the company's leading cadre group a strong fighting collective that highlights proletarian politics. The third platoon leader was originally a comrade who was relatively good at studying Chairman Mao's works. When the large-scale military exercises began, he was sent to participate in military training. After training for a while, he was said to be "not active" in training military skills and could not be a "××× style trainer," and was sent back midway. This made him very unhappy, and he decided to make a name for himself. Thus, he relaxed the study of Chairman Mao's works and focused on the "elite" military exercises. The third platoon leader's change made the political instructor Chen Jinyuan very anxious. For several years, Chen Jinyuan had worked hard to help the third platoon leader study Chairman Mao's works! In 1961, Chen Jinyuan heard that the third platoon leader was returning to the company from the infantry school, so he did everything he could to prepare a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for him. On the day of his return, Chen Jinyuan personally went to the regiment to pick him up, and on the way, he talked about how to study Chairman Mao's works. Chen Jinyuan knew that the third platoon leader had a low cultural level and had difficulties in studying, so he lived with the third platoon for three winters, sleeping on the same kang, heart to heart, sharing his experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works, step by step leading the third platoon leader onto the path of studying Mao Zedong Thought. But now, a cold wind had blown him onto a wrong path! Why did a comrade like the third platoon leader, who had several years of foundation in studying Chairman Mao's works, be blown off course by a cold wind? Chen Jinyuan habitually opened Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army has various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line." Chairman Mao's teachings made Chen Jinyuan further realize that it is necessary to firmly grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, to replace the "self" in the cadres' minds with "public," in order to grasp the firm and correct political direction. He and the Party branch members studied and, aiming at the problems exposed in the large-scale military exercises, used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to carry out a small rectification campaign to criticize and transform private thoughts.

This small rectification campaign lasted for more than a month and achieved good results. The third platoon leader summarized the painful lessons from the large-scale military exercises. He said: "I should have led the way in reading Chairman Mao's books and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. But because of the 'self' in my mind, I changed direction. This lesson is too profound." After the small rectification campaign, he became sober-minded and his direction became clearer. All the cadres and soldiers in the company were deeply educated by the third platoon leader's transformation.

The deeper the Red Ninth Company studied Chairman Mao's works, the sharper the struggle became. That autumn, the Red Ninth Company conducted a live-fire shooting exercise and scored a pass. Luo Ruiqing seized this opportunity to make a big fuss, crazily shouting that studying Chairman Mao's works should be "implemented" in military training. For a time, phrases like "Red Ninth Company studies 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' but does not implement it," "Red Ninth Company studies 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' well, but cannot convince people," "Red Ninth Company is missing a leg," etc., rained down on the comrades of the Red Ninth Company.

The combat collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought is fearless. The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company were not afraid of heaven or earth. They relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to engage in a head-on struggle with Luo Ruiqing.

Where should the study of Chairman Mao's works be implemented? The Party branch of the Red Ninth Company organized all the cadres and soldiers to seriously discuss this issue, greatly raising their awareness of highlighting proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers said: "The fundamental purpose of studying Chairman Mao's works is to achieve ideological transformation. Emphasizing that the study of Chairman Mao's works should be implemented in military training is essentially the single military view that Chairman Mao criticized more than thirty years ago, that 'military is good, politics will naturally be good.'"

"You do your large-scale military exercises, I do my study of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.'" The Red Ninth Company did not pay any attention to Luo Ruiqing's shouting, advancing bravely on the bright path of studying Mao Zedong Thought. That year, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's basic views on class and class struggle, politics commanding the military, etc., in connection with the company's actual ideological problems, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois thoughts and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. The troops were spirited and full of fighting spirit. During the long period of dispersed field training, they withstood the sharp and complex class struggle in the countryside and, in difficult and harsh conditions, successfully completed all tasks. Especially praised by the masses was that they propagated Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, "walking one path, reddening one line, living in one village, reddening one piece." That year, the company produced a large number of activists who studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Some, after demobilization, returned to their hometowns and became propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. They raised the level of studying Mao Zedong Thought to a new height and raised the revolutionary construction of the company to a new level.

Just that year, the Ministry of Defense conferred on the Red Ninth Company the glorious title of "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works." That year's National Day, representatives of the Red Ninth Company went to Beijing to participate in the celebration and saw our most red sun, our great leader Chairman Mao! The comrades of the Red Ninth Company reviewed the victories they had achieved in the struggle against the bourgeois military line under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in the past year, and could not help but shout over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian military line!

Withstanding the pressure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist element, insisting on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with the spirit of rectification

At the end of 1964, Vice Chairman Lin Biao made important instructions on highlighting proletarian politics, stressing the strengthening of political and ideological work and the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Under Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, the entire army launched a broader and deeper wave of studying Mao Zedong Thought. Luo Ruiqing's large-scale military exercises were thoroughly defeated.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat and will make their last struggles." Like all reactionaries, Luo Ruiqing, after suffering defeat, was also unwilling to give up and made desperate struggles. Vice Chairman Lin's establishment of the Red Ninth Company as a red banner of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought became a serious obstacle to Luo Ruiqing's promotion of the bourgeois military line. Thus, he directed his counter-revolutionary spearhead directly at the Red Ninth Company.

Vice Chairman Lin said: The study of Chairman Mao's works should be with problems, studying and applying, combining study and use, learning first what is urgently needed, seeing results immediately, and working hard on the "use." The Red Ninth Company firmly implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, insisting on the principle of studying and applying, working hard on transforming the worldview. They used the method of small rectification to study Chairman Mao's works, carrying out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, and achieving good results. The "Liberation Army Daily" introduced the experience of the Red Ninth Company's small rectification, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The masses praised: The experience of the Red Ninth Company's small rectification raised the level of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new height. The extreme enemy of Mao Zedong Thought, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, however, saw this important experience of the Red Ninth Company as a thorn in his eye and a thorn in his flesh, desperately opposing and suppressing it.

In January 1965, Luo Ruiqing viciously slandered the small rectification at a meeting, saying: "The small rectification is playing with words." He immediately issued an order: "Do not publish in the newspaper from now on."

Luo Ruiqing's order reached the Red Ninth Company, and the comrades were very angry. Chairman Mao had long pointed out: "The rectification movement is a 'universal Marxist education movement.' Rectification is the whole Party learning Marxism through criticism and self-criticism. In the rectification, we can certainly learn more Marxism." The resolution of the enlarged Military Commission meeting specifically pointed out: "Regularly, in accordance with the main problems existing in the work of the branch, adopt the method of 'small rectification,' checking, rectifying, and educating while working, to enhance the fighting strength of the branch." The small rectification of the Red Ninth Company was a good method they had gradually summarized over the years in implementing the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, in accordance with the actual needs of the class struggle. This method inherited and carried forward the revolutionary learning style that Chairman Mao had always advocated, better guiding cadres and soldiers to have a revolution in their souls, and consciously transforming various non-proletarian thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought. Why was Luo Ruiqing not interested at all? The comrades of the Red Ninth Company thought and thought, the more they thought, the more they felt something was wrong. They said, we use the revolutionary learning style to study revolutionary truths and will not be wrong. They did not pay attention to the curses of this "big shot" and insisted on carrying out the small rectification. Soon, they summarized the experience of "letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in the company," further explaining that the small rectification was to uproot bourgeois thoughts and plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought. This experience was once again warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This time, Luo Ruiqing was even more furious, shouting: "Small rectification, big persecution, persecuting people so that they dare not speak their minds," "what rooting, uprooting, digging out imprints, digging out the ancestors three generations!" At that time, many people were worried: How long will the small rectification last? Will the red flag of the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" still be able to fly? However, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company did not think this way. They thought: If we do not uproot bourgeois thoughts in people's minds and establish Mao Zedong Thought, our people will become revisionists, the country will change color, and the great tragedy of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union will be repeated in our country! They thought: The revolutionary cause of Marxism-Leninism opened up by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries must have successors, and every revolutionary soldier should make Chairman Mao, the old man, rest assured.

Luo Ruiqing opposed the small rectification, but the Red Ninth Company insisted on carrying out the small rectification. Luo Ruiqing did not allow the propaganda of the experience of the small rectification, but the Red Ninth Company insisted on propagating it everywhere. Luo Ruiqing opposed the small rectification for a year, and the Red Ninth Company also carried out the small rectification for a year. That year, they successively carried out many small rectifications with Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle, serving the people, one divides into two, the relationship between internal and external causes, etc., as the central content, thoroughly uprooting the imprints of bourgeois thoughts. They firmly guarded the front line of Mao Zedong Thought, not yielding an inch!

In July 1965, Luo Ruiqing heard that the Red Ninth Company was still continuing the small rectification, continuing to "uproot," "root," and "dig out imprints," and immediately ordered someone from Beijing to call the unit where the Red Ninth Company was stationed, ordering the Red Ninth Company not to carry out "uprooting," "rooting," and "digging out imprints" again. The Red Ninth Company did not pay any attention to him at all. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company believed that opposing the small rectification, not allowing the uprooting of bourgeois thought imprints, not allowing the uprooting of bourgeois thought roots, was essentially advocating "merging into one," denying class struggle in the ideological and political realm. They seized this contradiction, using "merging into one" as a target, and deeply criticized the reactionary thought of "class struggle reconciliation" in the company. The soldiers linked their own experiences and said: "In class society, if one does not consciously achieve ideological transformation, one will be subtly influenced by bourgeois thoughts." "Proletarian thoughts and bourgeois thoughts 'live together,' can only struggle and transform, and cannot transition peacefully. If bourgeois thoughts are not dug out to the root, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be deeply rooted." "One must be able to divide and also be able to struggle with one's own thoughts; being able to divide, one can see clearly the two kinds of thoughts in one's mind; being able to struggle, one can use Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against non-proletarian thoughts." "Whoever is afraid of digging and uprooting is afraid of ideological revolution; whoever opposes digging and uprooting is opposing ideological revolution." Through the criticism of "merging into one," Luo Ruiqing's nonsense was refuted completely, greatly raising the cadres' and soldiers' awareness of struggling against selfishness and the awareness of defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The small rectification carried out by the Red Ninth Company was not "persecuting people" at all, but using Mao Zedong Thought to educate, transform, and cultivate people. After several small rectifications, Mao Zedong Thought deeply took root in the minds of the cadres and soldiers, the backward became advanced, and the advanced became even more advanced, fostering batch after batch of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause loyal to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Opportunists who try to block the tide, although they are almost everywhere, the tide is unstoppable, socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, throwing all obstacles behind its back." History is ruthless. The great historical tide of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers grasping Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. At the end of 1965, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally exposed Luo Ruiqing's plot to seize the military and oppose the Party, and Luo Ruiqing was thrown into the garbage heap of history. The small rectification, which inherited and carried forward Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style, was widely spread within and outside the military, and in the deep development of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and on the battlefield of eliminating bourgeois thoughts and establishing proletarian thoughts, it showed its power more and more.

Deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, raising the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought to a new level

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, opened the lid on the struggle between the two lines within the Party. At the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," exposing the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship, with Liu Shaoqi as the head, and pointing out the general target of attack for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company saw more clearly: Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing dared to openly oppose Mao Zedong Thought, crazily destroy the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and promote the bourgeois military line, precisely because they had the counter-revolutionary black backer Liu Shaoqi. This great traitor, Liu Shaoqi, had long been organizing factions, recruiting traitors, and establishing an underground black headquarters, peddling revisionist black goods, plotting to seize the Party and the government, attempting to turn the Marxist-Leninist Party into a revisionist Party, and turn the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. These bad guys are the main targets of the proletarian dictatorship revolution and the most dangerous enemies of the proletarian dictatorship. Reviewing the struggles experienced over the past eight years, the cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company had many old and new grudges to settle with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party! They closely followed the great strategist Chairman Mao's strategic deployments, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "participate in the cultural revolutionary struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie at any time," deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism.

Last spring, all the cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company, in connection with the education of the struggle between the two lines, concentrated time and firepower to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's black "Cultivation." They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies one by one.

When the comrades of the Red Ninth Company responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," they went to the front lines of the "Three Supports and Two Militarys." Wherever they went, they carried out revolutionary criticism with the revolutionary masses and cadres of the proletarian revolutionary line, propagating Mao Zedong Thought. In the countryside, they recalled bitterness and sweetness with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the fields and on the kangs, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's black goods of "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms"; in the factories, they criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in industry with the workers in the workshops and dormitories; in schools participating in military training, they criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line with the revolutionary teachers and students.

The Red Ninth Company fought in unity with the proletarian revolutionary cadres, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and launched fierce attacks on Liu Shaoqi. The broad revolutionary masses were joyful and excited, and the class enemies were extremely terrified. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and ghosts and monsters hiding in dark corners fanned the evil winds and lit the ghost fires, desperately obstructing and destroying the Red Ninth Company's carrying out revolutionary criticism with the masses. They gnashed their teeth and said: "We must let the Red Ninth Company come in red and go out black!" Facing the provocation of the class enemies, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company did not retreat an inch. They firmly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and, with the revolutionary masses, insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism, always directing the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with Liu Shaoqi as the head. The more they criticized Liu Shaoqi, the more they hated him, and the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao. In the revolutionary criticism, they greatly raised the cadres' and soldiers' awareness of the line struggle. To defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, with red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, always placing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in a position higher than everything else.

Soldier Zhang Xin was seriously injured in the line of duty. After being sent to the hospital, he was unconscious for four days and four nights. When he woke up, he did not think of his personal safety, but constantly remembered propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He found that there were two convalescent soldiers with different viewpoints in the ward, often arguing due to the influence of bourgeois factionalism, so he endured the intense pain to help the two convalescent soldiers study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. The two, with Zhang Xin's help, finally eliminated their estrangement and united to fight against the enemy together.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Ninth Company's study and application of Mao Zedong Thought developed further. They combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness in the study process, combining revolutionary criticism with the small rectification. The Party branch timely summarized the experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the Cultural Revolution, proposing the method of "finding problems from the line struggle, finding the cause from the worldview, finding the answer from Chairman Mao's works, and seeing the effect from actual actions," firmly grasping the key points, touching the soul, constantly transforming the worldview in the line struggle. The cadres and soldiers were even more clear-minded, no matter how sharp and fierce the class struggle was, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company always stood firmly, with clear banners, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses, promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, making the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters fall into the vast sea of people's war.

Vice Chairman Lin said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a political class without exams. The Red Ninth Company, in this Cultural Revolution movement, was tested and tempered. Reviewing the eight-year battle course, the comrades of the Red Ninth Company deeply realized: Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. With Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, achieving the ideological transformation of people, this is a matter of life and death for the country, the Party, and the government, and is the most important issue of whether the people obtain everything or lose everything. The reality of class struggle tells us: Studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, widely and deeply propagating Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental issue of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company are determined to strive even harder to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the stormy waves of class struggle, widely and deeply propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and at any time firmly implementing and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian military line!

　　——记在两条路线斗争中成长的“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”
    在广大工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风雨中，全国全军涌现出了千百万活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子和先进集体。沈阳部队某团红九连，就是一个突出的代表。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军应该是一个大学校。”毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席到部队视察时曾经给予红九连高度的评价。林副主席说：“好的连队就是一个学校，九连就是一个好学校。”
    红九连的干部战士积极响应林彪副主席“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的战斗号召，多年如一日地坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，创造出一个又一个活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验，培养出一批又一批忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命战士。从一九六一年开展创造四好连队运动以来，红九连年年被评为四好连队；一九六四年七月，被国防部命名为“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，红九连又把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提高到一个新水平。他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争第一线，坚持用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众，为人民立下了新的功勋。
    “正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”红九连从一九五九年开始学习毛主席著作，到现在八年了。过去的八年，是努力学习毛泽东思想的八年，也是和中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿斗争的八年。忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红九连的干部战士，顶狂风，战恶浪，勇敢地捍卫了毛泽东思想，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。
    响应林彪副主席的伟大号召掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开拓了活学活用毛泽东思想的康庄大道。红九连活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，就是在林副主席的号召下开展起来的。
    一九五九年以前的一段时间，大阴谋家、大野心家、反革命修正主义分子彭德怀，拚命地推行了一条资产阶级军事路线，大搞所谓“正规化”、“现代化”、系统学文化，疯狂地反对广大指战员活学活用毛泽东思想，妄图改变我军的性质。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的八届八中全会，彻底粉碎了彭德怀这个反革命修正主义分子篡军反党的罪恶阴谋，决定林副主席主持军委工作。林副主席主持军委工作不久，就发表了《高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗阔步前进》的重要文章。林副主席彻底批判了彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线，勇敢地捍卫了伟大的毛泽东思想。林副主席在这篇文章中指出：“认真学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东同志的著作，确立无产阶级的世界观，是我军每一个干部和共产党员必尽的义务。”
    望着这一行行金光闪闪的大字，红九连的同志们喜悦和鼓舞交织在一起。党支部开始组织连队的骨干学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等光辉篇章。革命战士学习了毛主席著作，从心底里迸发出对毛泽东思想无比深厚的无产阶级感情。
    一九六○年十月，林副主席亲自主持制订的在我军建军史上具有伟大意义的军委扩大会议决议，发出了“高举毛泽东思想红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的号召，要求全军指战员人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。决议传到红九连，全连同志读了一遍又一遍，越读无产阶级感情越深。大家说：军委扩大会议决议说出了我们的心里话，给我们定了向。红九连和全军所有的连队一样，在林副主席这个战斗号召的鼓舞下，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮。干部战士争先恐后地买毛主席著作，抄毛主席著作，刻苦地学习毛主席著作，无限幸福地成长在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下。战士们用诗歌表达了他们当时的心情：“细心读‘毛著’，一字一盏灯，照亮我的心，前进无止境。”
    一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。钻进党内的反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿继承了彭德怀的衣钵，对部队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，恨得要死，怕得要命。他利用窃取的重要职务，打着“红旗”反红旗，到处大吹冷风，大唱反调，妄想把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动一瓢冷水泼下去。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿来到红九连所在的部队。这个家伙一下车，就到处叫喊什么“不能光靠书本子练兵”，规定“每天训练七小时，其它时间作为擦拭武器，射击预习”，就是不给部队学习毛主席著作的时间。他还含沙射影地谩骂积极学习毛主席著作的人，极力阻挠和破坏部队学习毛主席著作。
    在逆流袭来的日子里，红九连的同志们一遍又一遍地学习古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议，反复思索着这个问题。彭德怀推行资产阶级军事路线的苦头我们已经吃够了，林副主席号召活学活用毛泽东思想的甜头我们才刚刚尝到，罗瑞卿不让读毛主席的书，我们的干部战士绝对不答应！
    红九连是毛主席亲手创建的一个红军连队，从秋收起义到井冈山斗争，一直战斗在毛主席的身边。长征时期，红九连随中央红军长驱二万五千里，没有离开过毛主席一步。抗日战争爆发后，毛主席挥手东指，红九连在林彪同志的直接指挥下，参加了闻名中外的平型关大战，荣获“平型关大战突击连”的光荣称号。解放战争时期，红九连转战南北，远离毛主席千山万水，心跟毛主席寸步不离，始终在毛泽东思想的指引下，从胜利走向胜利。红九连的同志回顾了连队跟着毛主席战斗成长的光辉历程，满怀激情地说：“几十年前，我们靠毛主席生，几十年来，我们又靠毛主席长。有毛主席，才有我们红九连。我们红九连永远是毛主席的红九连！毛主席的书我们现在要读，今后要读，要永远读下去，要代代相传。”
    对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的坚定信仰，鼓舞着红九连的干部战士，他们坚守在毛泽东思想阵地上，岿然不动！
    罗瑞卿不准读毛主席的书，红九连的同志偏偏要大学大用毛主席著作。他们组织干部战士畅谈学习毛主席著作的甜头。干部战士深有体会地说：“我们就是要靠毛主席的书练兵，靠毛泽东思想干革命。”
    罗瑞卿不让部队有学习毛主席著作的时间，红九连党支部就专门作了个规定，用固定时间学习毛主席著作，并做到雷打不动。
    罗瑞卿恶毒地诬蔑、谩骂积极学习毛主席著作的人。红九连就培养和树立学习毛主席著作积极分子，宣扬他们的先进事迹。党支部坚持从学习毛主席著作积极分子中发展党员，从学习毛主席著作积极分子中提拔干部，保证连队的领导权永远掌握在忠于毛主席的人手中。红九连依靠毛泽东思想，一次又一次地抵制了来自罗瑞卿的压力，使他的阴谋一个接着一个遭到了破产。
    一九六一年夏天，我们敬爱的林副主席来到红九连所在部队。林副主席十分关心部队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，先后接见了这个部队的领导干部和红九连连长孙财等同志，仔细了解部队学习毛主席著作的情况。当林副主席听说干部战士积极热情地读毛主席的书时，十分高兴。林副主席听完汇报后，作了极其重要的指示。林副主席说：“好的连队就是一个学校，九连就是一个好学校。”林副主席的指示一传达到连队，全连同志欢呼跳跃，激动得热泪盈眶：敬爱的林副主席，在过去的战争岁月里，我们在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，在您亲自指挥下战斗成长；当我们受到资产阶级军事路线的毒害时，是您指示我们活学活用毛泽东思想，使我们端正地前进在毛泽东思想的航线上；现在，当我们活学活用毛泽东思想受到阻挠和破坏的时候，您又给了我们无比巨大的力量。全连同志一个声音：以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高举起，永远飘扬在红九连的阵地上！
    击退资产阶级军事路线的冲击始终把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在第一位
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。着重政治建军是毛主席的一贯思想。林彪副主席忠实地执行了毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，提出了活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主、创造四好连队等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则。在这些方针原则指引下，全军学习毛泽东思想群众运动的热潮一浪高过一浪，部队革命化建设出现了崭新的面貌，用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人正在茁壮成长。红九连活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动也在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。正在这时，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿又跳出来兴风作浪，到处贩卖“军事第一”的反动谬论，叫嚷“军事就是政治”，掀起了一股大比武的反动逆流。这股反动逆流，严重地冲击着部队的无产阶级思想阵地。红九连在这股逆流面前坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在第一位，狠抓人的思想革命化，顶住了罗瑞卿刮来的妖风。
    红九连党支部首先抓干部活学活用毛主席著作，提高干部贯彻毛主席无产阶级建军路线的觉悟，使连队的领导班子，成为一个突出无产阶级政治的坚强的战斗集体。三排长原来是一个学习毛主席著作比较好的同志，大比武开始时，被调去参加军事集训。集训了一阵，说他练军事技术“不积极”，不能当“×××式的教练员”，中途又退了回来。这样一来，他心里很不服气，下决心搞出点名堂来叫人家看一看。于是，他放松了毛主席著作的学习，大抓“尖子”比武。三排长的这种变化，使指导员陈金元很着急。几年来，陈金元为了帮助三排长学习毛主席著作，不知付出了多少心血！一九六一年，陈金元听说三排长要从步校回连队，就千方百计为他准备了一套《毛泽东选集》。回来那天，陈金元又亲自到团部去接他，一路上跟他谈的都是怎样学习毛主席著作的问题。陈金元知道三排长文化水平低，学习有困难，一连三个冬天住到三排，同三排长睡在一条炕上，心贴心地讲自己学习毛主席著作的体会，一步步地把三排长引上了学习毛泽东思想的道路。可是现在，一阵冷风把他吹到一条邪路上去了！象三排长这样的同志，已经有了几年学习毛主席著作的基础，为什么现在会被一阵冷风吹迷了方向？陈金元习惯地翻开了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”毛主席的教导使陈金元进一步认识到，必须狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，把干部头脑里的“私”字换成“公”字，才能把握住坚定正确的政治方向。他和党支部委员研究后，针对大比武中暴露出来的问题，以“老三篇”为武器，开展了一次破私立公小整风。
    这次小整风，持续了一个多月，收到了很好的效果。三排长总结了在大比武中的沉痛教训。他说：“自己本来应当带头读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事。可是，由于头脑里‘私’字作怪，就转了向。这个教训太深刻了。”经过小整风，他头脑清醒了，方向更明了。全连干部战士都从三排长的转变中受到了深刻的教育。
    红九连学习毛主席著作越深入，斗争也越尖锐。这年秋天，红九连进行了一次实弹射击，打了个及格。罗瑞卿就抓住这件事情，大做文章，疯狂叫嚷什么学习毛主席著作要“落实”到军事训练上。一时，什么“红九连学‘毛著’不落实”呀，“红九连学‘毛著’好，不能说服人”呀，“红九连缺一条腿”呀，等等，劈头盖脑地压到了红九连同志的头上。
    毛泽东思想武装的战斗集体，是无所畏惧的。红九连干部战士天不怕，地不怕，他们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，和罗瑞卿进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    学习毛主席著作究竟应当落实到哪里？红九连党支部组织全连干部战士针对这个问题展开了严肃认真的讨论，大大提高了对突出无产阶级政治、突出毛泽东思想的认识。战士们说：“学习毛主席著作的根本目的，是为了实现思想革命化。强调学习毛主席著作要落实到军事训练上，实质上是毛主席早在三十多年前就批判过的‘军事好，政治自然会好’的单纯军事观点。”
    “你搞你的大比武，我搞我的学‘毛著’”。红九连根本不理罗瑞卿的叫嚷，沿着学习毛泽东思想的光辉大道奋勇前进。这一年，他们结合连队的现实思想问题，反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、政治统帅军事等基本观点，大破了资产阶级思想，大立了毛泽东思想。部队精神焕发，斗志昂扬，在长期分散野营期间，经受了农村尖锐复杂的阶级斗争考验，在艰难困苦的情况下，圆满地完成了各项任务。特别受到群众赞扬的是，他们时时处处宣传毛泽东思想，“走一路，红一线，住一村，红一片”。这一年，连队涌现了一大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，有的退伍回到地方，成了传播毛泽东思想的宣传员。他们把学习毛泽东思想的水平提到了一个新高度，把连队革命化建设提到了一个新境界。
    就在这一年，国防部授予红九连以“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的光荣称号。这一年国庆节，红九连的代表到北京参加观礼，见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们的伟大领袖毛主席！红九连的同志们回顾一年来在毛泽东思想指引下，和资产阶级军事路线作斗争中所取得的胜利，情不自禁地一遍又一遍高呼：毛主席万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席的无产阶级建军路线万岁！
    顶住反革命修正主义分子的压力坚持用整风精神活学活用毛泽东思想
    一九六四年底，林彪副主席作出了关于突出无产阶级政治的重要指示，强调大力加强政治思想工作，大抓活学活用毛泽东思想。在林副主席的指示下，全军掀起了一个更广泛更深入的学习毛泽东思想的高潮。罗瑞卿搞的大比武，遭到了彻底破产。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”和一切反动派一样，罗瑞卿在遭到失败后，也并不甘心，还要作垂死的挣扎。林副主席树立红九连这样一面活学活用毛泽东思想的红旗，成为罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子推行资产阶级军事路线的一个严重障碍。于是，他把反革命的矛头直接指向了红九连。
    林副主席说：学习毛主席著作要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。红九连坚决贯彻林副主席的指示，坚持活学活用的原则，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。他们运用小整风方法学习毛主席著作，开展灭资兴无的斗争，取得了很好的效果。《解放军报》介绍了红九连小整风的经验，受到了广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。群众赞扬：红九连小整风的经验，把活学活用毛泽东思想的水平提到了一个新的高度。罗瑞卿这个极端仇视毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，却把红九连的这个重要经验看成是眼中钉，肉中刺，拚命地加以反对和压制。
    一九六五年一月，罗瑞卿在一次会议上恶毒地污蔑小整风说：“小整风是在名词上打圈子。”他当场下了一道禁令：“以后不要登报。”
    罗瑞卿这道禁令传到红九连，红九连的同志非常气愤。毛主席早就指出：“整风运动是一个‘普遍的马克思主义的教育运动’。整风就是全党通过批评和自我批评来学习马克思主义。在整风中间，我们一定可以更多地学到一些马克思主义。”军委扩大会议决议特别指出：“经常针对支部工作中存在的主要问题，采取‘小整风’的方法，边检查、边整顿、边教育，提高支部的战斗力。”红九连的小整风就是他们几年来在贯彻毛主席和林副主席这些指示的过程中，针对现实阶级斗争的需要，逐步总结出来的一种活学活用毛泽东思想的好方法。这个方法继承和发扬了毛主席历来倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，更好地引导干部战士在灵魂深处爆发革命，用毛泽东思想自觉地改造各种非无产阶级思想。为什么罗瑞卿如此不感兴趣？红九连的同志想来想去，越想越觉得不对头。他们说，我们用革命学风来学习革命的真理，决不会错。他们没有理睬这个“大人物”的叫骂，坚持搞小整风。不久，又总结了“让毛泽东思想在连队扎根”的经验，进一步阐明，小整风就是要拔资产阶级思想根子，扎下毛泽东思想根子。这篇经验再一次受到广大工农兵群众的欢迎和好评。
    这一来，罗瑞卿更加暴跳如雷，又大肆叫嚷说：“小整风，大整人，整得人不敢讲心里话”，“什么扎根，拔根，挖烙印，把祖宗三代都挖了！”当时，不少人都在担心：小整风的命运究竟还有多长？“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”这面红旗还能打多久？但是，红九连的同志没有这样想，他们想的是，如果在人们头脑里不破掉资产阶级思想，不树立毛泽东思想，我们的人就要变修，国家就要变色，苏联资本主义复辟的大悲剧就要在我们国家重演！他们想的是，老一代无产阶级革命家所开创的马克思列宁主义革命事业必须后继有人，我们每个革命战士都应当让毛主席他老人家放心。
    罗瑞卿反对小整风，红九连偏偏大搞小整风，罗瑞卿不准宣传小整风的经验，红九连偏偏要到处宣传。罗瑞卿反了一年的小整风，红九连也搞了一年的小整风。这一年，他们接连以毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、为人民服务、一分为二、内因和外因的关系等论述为中心内容，搞了多次小整风，狠挖资产阶级思想烙印。他们坚定地守卫在毛泽东思想阵地上，一步也不让！
    一九六五年七月，罗瑞卿听说红九连还在继续搞小整风，继续“拔根”、“扎根”、“挖烙印”，马上叫人从北京打电话给红九连所在的部队，责令红九连不准再搞“拔根”、“扎根”、“挖烙印”。红九连根本没有理他那一套。红九连的同志认为，反对小整风，不准挖资产阶级思想烙印，不准拔资产阶级思想根子，实质上是提倡“合二而一”，否认政治思想领域里的阶级斗争。他们就抓住这个对立面，以“合二而一”为靶子，在连队深入批判了“阶级斗争调和”论的反动思想。战士们联系自己的切身体会说：“在阶级社会中，不自觉地实现思想革命化，就要被资产阶级思想潜移默化。”“无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想‘住宿’在一起，只能斗争转化，绝不能和平过渡。资产阶级思想挖不到痛处，毛泽东思想就扎不到深处。”“对自己的思想既要会分，更要会斗。会分，才能看清自己头脑里的两种思想；会斗，才能用毛泽东思想斗掉非无产阶级思想。”“谁怕挖、怕拔，谁就是害怕思想革命；谁反对挖、反对拔，谁就是反对思想革命。”通过批判“合二而一”，把罗瑞卿的谰言，批驳得体无完肤，大大提高了干部战士斗私的自觉性，提高了捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    红九连搞的小整风根本不是什么“整人”，而是用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人、培养人。经过一次次小整风，毛泽东思想在干部战士头脑里深深扎下了根，后进变先进，先进更先进，培养出一批批忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”历史是无情的。广大工农兵群众起来掌握毛泽东思想的伟大历史潮流，是不可阻挡的。一九六五年底，毛主席和林副主席亲自揭发了罗瑞卿篡军反党的罪恶阴谋，罗瑞卿被扔进了历史的垃圾堆。继承和发扬了毛主席的革命学风的小整风，在军内外广泛地传播开来，在深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，在灭资兴无的战场上，更加显示出了它的威力。
    深入持久地开展革命大批判把活学活用毛泽东思想提高到新水平
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了党内两条路线斗争的盖子。在党的八届十一中全会上，毛主席写出了《炮打司令部》的大字报，揭露了隐藏在无产阶级专政内部的、以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，为亿万革命群众指出了攻击的总目标。红九连的同志们更加清楚地看到：彭德怀、罗瑞卿所以敢明目张胆地反对毛泽东思想，疯狂破坏活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，推行资产阶级军事路线，就是因为有中国赫鲁晓夫这个反革命黑后台。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒，长期以来结党营私，招降纳叛，组织了一个地下黑司令部，大肆贩卖修正主义的黑货，阴谋篡党、篡政，妄图变马列主义的党为修正主义的党，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。这帮坏家伙，是无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，是无产阶级专政最危险的敌人。回顾八年来经历过的斗争，红九连的干部战士有多少旧恨新仇要向党内最大一小撮走资派清算！他们紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，遵照毛主席“要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”的教导，深入地、持久地开展革命大批判。
    去年春天，红九连的全体干部战士，结合两条路线斗争教育，集中时间、集中火力狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，一条条地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论。
    当红九连的同志响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的号召，走上“三支”“两军”第一线以后，他们走到那里，就和那里的无产阶级革命派、革命群众一起开展革命大批判，宣传毛泽东思想。到农村，他们在田间、炕头和贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货；到工厂，他们在车间、宿舍，和工人一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫在工业上推行的反革命修正主义路线；到学校参加军训，他们就和革命师生一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。
    红九连和无产阶级革命派团结战斗，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。广大革命群众欢欣鼓舞，阶级敌人极端恐慌。党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神躲藏在阴暗的角落里，煽阴风，点鬼火，极力阻挠、破坏红九连和群众一起开展革命大批判。他们咬牙切齿地说：“要让红九连红着进来，黑着出去！”面对着阶级敌人的挑衅，红九连的同志们毫不退让，他们坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，和革命群众一起，坚持开展革命大批判，把斗争的矛头始终对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派。他们越批对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对伟大领袖毛主席越爱，在革命大批判中大大提高了干部战士的路线斗争觉悟。为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，红九连的同志刀山敢上，火海敢闯，颗颗红心忠于毛主席，始终把宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线放在高于一切的地位。
    战士张信，因公身负重伤。送到医院后四天四夜昏迷不醒。他苏醒过来，想到的不是个人的生命安危，而是念念不忘宣传毛泽东思想、宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他发现病房里有两个不同观点的休养员由于受了资产阶级派性的影响经常争吵，他就忍着剧烈的疼痛帮助两个休养员学习毛主席的最新指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。两人在张信的帮助下，终于消除了隔阂，联合起来共同对敌。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，红九连活学活用毛泽东思想又有了新的发展。他们在学习过程中，把批修和斗私结合起来，把革命大批判和小整风结合起来。党支部及时总结了在文化大革命中活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，提出“从路线斗争中找问题，从世界观上找原因，从毛主席著作里找答案，从实际行动中看效果”的方法，狠抓大节，猛触灵魂，不断在路线斗争中改造世界观。干部战士更加心明眼亮，不论阶级斗争怎么尖锐，怎么激烈，红九连的同志们始终立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决支持左派广大群众，促进革命大联合和革命三结合，使党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海中。
    林副主席说：无产阶级文化大革命是不上课的政治课，不考试的考试。红九连在这次文化大革命运动中，经受了考验，得到了锻炼。回顾八年来的战斗历程，红九连的同志们深深地认识到：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，这是关系着国家的存亡，党的存亡，政权的存亡，是人民得到一切或丧失一切的头等重大问题。阶级斗争的现实告诉我们：活学活用毛泽东思想，广泛地、深入地传播毛泽东思想，是巩固无产阶级专政的根本问题。红九连的同志们决心在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，更加努力地活学活用毛泽东思想，广泛深入地传播毛泽东思想，在任何时候都坚决贯彻、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进！
