The working class and laboring people of the world, under different circumstances, celebrated their day of unity and struggle—the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Fifty years ago, the workers and other laboring people of the Soviet Union, as the masters of the world's first socialist state, stood in the heroic posture of having defeated the bourgeoisie, brimming with the triumphant spirit of victory, and celebrated the first "May Day" after the victory of the October Revolution.

However, now, with the usurpation of power by the Khrushchev traitor clique, capitalism has been fully restored in the Soviet Union. The Soviet working class has once again been reduced to a position of slavery and exploitation. They have no political rights and can be persecuted at any time; they are exploited and oppressed economically and often face the threat of being fired and unemployed. The Soviet working class and laboring people are suffering a double ordeal. The difference is that fifty years ago, the landlords and capitalists of Tsarist Russia were riding on the heads of the Soviet working class and toiling masses, while now it is the bourgeois privileged class represented by the Brezhnev and Kosygin-led Soviet revisionist clique.

The bourgeois privileged class, using various privileges in politics and economics, acts arrogantly and tyrannically. They plunder the fruits of the Soviet people's labor, living a parasitic and decadent bourgeois life. They are genuine capitalists.

The relationship between the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of the Soviet Union and the bourgeois privileged class is one of exploitation and being exploited, oppression and being oppressed. The contradictions between them are irreconcilable and antagonistic. Their struggle is a life-and-death class struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counterrevolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The fundamental reason why the Soviet working class has once again fallen into a position of oppression and slavery is that the Soviet working class, after seizing power, has once again lost it. The proletarian dictatorship established by the October Socialist Revolution has become a bourgeois dictatorship that oppresses the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. Once the working class that holds power loses it, it also loses all the rights won by countless martyrs with their blood and sacrifice. Therefore, the proletariat that has already seized power must never forget proletarian dictatorship and must not allow figures like Khrushchev to usurp power, otherwise, there is the danger of capitalist restoration. The Soviet red power being usurped by the counterrevolutionary revisionist clique is a bitter historical lesson for the Soviet working class and the broad masses of laboring people, and for the international proletariat.

We firmly believe that the Soviet working class and laboring people, with strong class hatred, will rekindle high revolutionary spirit and fight unremittingly to defend the great cause of proletarian revolution of Lenin and Stalin. In this era, capitalism and imperialism are heading towards comprehensive collapse, and socialism is heading towards world victory. This is an irresistible historical trend. The final doom of the bourgeois dictatorship established by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and the reestablishment of the Soviet proletarian dictatorship are equally irresistible historical currents.

### 失去政权就失去一切

　　失去政权就失去一切
    全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民在不同的境遇下，庆祝了自己团结战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节。
    五十年前，苏联的工人和其它劳动人民，作为世界上第一个社会主义国家的主人，以战胜资产阶级的英雄姿态，满怀着胜利的豪情，欢庆十月革命胜利后的第一个“五一”节。
    可是现在，随着赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团篡夺政权，在苏联全面复辟资本主义，苏联工人阶级又重新被打入被奴役、受剥削的地位。他们在政治上无权，随时都可能遭到迫害；他们在经济上受剥削受压榨，经常面临着被解雇和失业的威胁。苏联工人阶级和劳动人民正在受二遍苦。不同的是，五十年以前，骑在苏联工人阶级和劳苦大众头上的是沙皇俄国的地主资本家，而现在却是以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修集团所代表的资产阶级特权阶层。
    资产阶级特权阶层利用政治上、经济上享有的种种特权，横行霸道，作威作福。他们侵吞苏联人民的劳动成果，过着寄生、腐烂的资产阶级生活。他们是地地道道的资本家。
    苏联的工人、农民和革命知识分子同资产阶级特权阶层之间的关系，是被剥削和剥削、被压迫和压迫的关系。他们之间的矛盾，是不可调和的、对抗性的矛盾。他们之间的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    苏联工人阶级之所以重新沦为被压迫被奴役的地位，根本的关键就在于，夺取了政权的苏联工人阶级，重新又失去了政权。十月社会主义革命所创建的无产阶级专政，变成了压迫无产阶级和广大劳动人民的资产阶级专政。掌握政权的工人阶级，一旦失去了政权，也就丧失了无数先烈流血牺牲所赢得的一切权利。因此，已经取得了政权的无产阶级，要念念不忘无产阶级专政，决不能让赫鲁晓夫这样的人物篡夺政权，否则就有复辟资本主义的危险。苏联红色政权被反革命修正主义集团所篡夺，这对于苏联的工人阶级和广大劳动人民，对于国际无产阶级来说，都是一个惨痛的历史教训。
    我们坚信，苏联工人阶级和劳动人民，将怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，焕发起高昂的革命精神，为捍卫伟大列宁和斯大林的无产阶级革命事业而进行不懈的斗争。在今天的时代，资本主义和帝国主义正在走向全面崩溃、社会主义正在走向全世界胜利。这是任何力量不可阻挡的。苏修叛徒集团建立的资产阶级专政的最后灭亡和苏联无产阶级专政的重新建立，同样是不可抗拒的历史潮流。
