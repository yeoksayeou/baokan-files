The Central Committee of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party issued a statement on the 23rd, severely condemning the French revisionist group that controls the French General Confederation of Labor for sabotaging the workers' and students' movements in France.

The statement said that the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party today severely condemns the treacherous communiqué issued by the executive committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, which claims that the demonstration on May 22nd was of a "provocative nature."

The statement pointed out that the revisionist leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor are increasingly moving along the path of class collaboration that benefits the monopoly capitalist regime. Instead of directing all their efforts against the government of Pompidou, the banker, they are directing them against the students.

The statement further pointed out that the French revisionist union leaders are trying to limit the workers' struggle for rights to purely social and economic issues, attempting to turn workers against students. Therefore, they have clearly revealed themselves to be bourgeois agents infiltrating the workers' movement.

The statement pointed out that the French General Confederation of Labor is a traitor to the French working class. Because it colludes with the government, it has lost the right to speak on behalf of the French working class and the laboring people.

    法修总工会完全背叛法国工人阶级  无权代表工人阶级和劳动人民说话
    新华社二十九日讯　巴黎消息：法国马克思列宁主义共产党中央委员会二十三日发表声明，严厉谴责法国修正主义集团控制法国总工会破坏法国的工人和学生运动。
    声明说，法国马克思列宁主义共产党今天严厉谴责法国总工会执行局的背叛性公报，这个公报说什么五月二十二日的示威具有“挑衅性质”。
    声明指出，法国总工会的修正主义领导人，在有助于垄断资本政权的阶级合作路线上走得越来越远了。他们不是把他们的一切矛头对准蓬皮杜这位银行经理的政府，而是对准学生。
    声明还指出，法国修正主义工会头目竭力把工人要求权利的运动限制在纯社会和经济方面，企图使工人反对学生，因此，他们就昭然若揭地表现出他们是钻到工人运动内部的资产阶级代理人。
    声明指出，法国总工会是法国工人阶级的叛徒。由于它和政府相勾结，它就失去了代表法国工人阶级和劳动人民说话的权利。
