The five revolutionary leading cadres of the revolutionary committee of the Iqing Wood Materials Hydrolysis Plant have been fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, they are even stricter with themselves and play a leading role in all aspects.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 27th: The revolutionary leading cadres of the Iqing Wood Materials Hydrolysis Plant in Heilongjiang Province have been remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not eating old capital, but establishing new merits." After being selected into the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee, they have been even stricter with themselves, closely connected with the masses, and played a leading role in all aspects, making new contributions to building a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre team.

The five revolutionary leading cadres selected into the plant's revolutionary committee have been fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making contributions and establishing merits. Due to the trust of the revolutionary masses, as soon as the plant's revolutionary committee was established, they were selected into the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre team, and some even became deputy directors. After entering the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre team, how should they continue to advance? These revolutionary leading cadres have seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and realized that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the Party and the people have put forward higher requirements for revolutionary leading cadres. If they stagnate and rely on old merits, they will inevitably fall behind the masses and even go astray. Therefore, they believe that the more achievements in work, the stricter one should be in self-demands; the more trust from the masses, the closer one should be to the masses. Only in this way can they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and keep up with the needs of the developing situation with vigor and vitality.

After their consciousness was raised, they insisted on putting the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionization of ideology in the first place in the face of numerous work tasks, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their world outlook, and consciously going to the great waves of class struggle to temper their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. In February this year, a small handful of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who infiltrated the plant stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind and a right-wing wind of reversing verdicts, deceiving a part of the masses, and attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee. Faced with this situation, what should be done? A revolutionary leading cadre and deputy director of the revolutionary committee once had a fleeting thought of fearing to attract fire. When he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "our responsibility is to the people," he immediately realized that it was the "self" in his mind playing tricks. He immediately abandoned his selfish thoughts, faced the class struggle head-on, and stood out, going to the masses to expose the evil plots of the class enemies on one hand and vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the deceived masses on the other, doing in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. The deceived masses quickly awakened and turned against the class enemies, exposing their ugly faces in broad daylight.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." The revolutionary leading cadres of this plant remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "being both an 'official' and a commoner," always maintaining the character of an ordinary laborer. Although they are responsible for important leading work in the revolutionary committee, once they are in the office, they personally fetch water, sweep the floor, and empty the spittoons, acting as ordinary clerks; when they go to the workshop, they work with the workers to saw wood and carry boards, acting as ordinary laborers; when they return home, they sit on the same kang with their wives and children to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fight against selfishness and revise wrong ideas, acting as ordinary students in the family Mao Zedong Thought study class. One revolutionary leading cadre used to often go to the workshops to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the workers and convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After entering the "three-in-one combination" leading cadre team, he felt that this was not enough, that his body had entered the masses but his thoughts had not truly entered the masses, and sometimes he still talked more and learned less from the masses. After that, every time he went to the workshop, he first did not say anything but first bowed to the masses as teachers, humbly learning from the masses; he took the lead in exposing his selfishness and fighting against it, actively giving his heart to the masses, and striving to think what the masses think, worry about what the masses worry about, and help what the masses need.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." The revolutionary leading cadres of this plant deeply understand from Chairman Mao's great teaching that the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee come from the masses, know the masses best, are most familiar with the masses, and can best reflect the opinions and voices of the masses, representing the interests of the masses. Revolutionary leading cadres accept the criticism and supervision of the masses, first of all, they should accept the criticism and supervision of the revolutionary mass representatives. Therefore, every time the revolutionary committee discusses and studies major issues of revolution and production, it always allocates sufficient time to let the revolutionary mass representatives express their opinions, and as long as they are correct, even if it is just a little, it should be adopted immediately. Some revolutionary mass representatives went out for business, and the revolutionary leading cadres also told them the issues discussed at the meeting and asked them to put forward their opinions individually. In this way, not only did the revolutionary leading cadres avoid deviations and errors in their work, but they also deepened their profound feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the beginning of the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some revolutionary leading cadres were busy sitting upstairs handling affairs, and the masses criticized this. The revolutionary leading cadres immediately went to the masses, took the lead in exposing their selfishness and fighting against it, and extensively solicited the opinions and criticisms of the revolutionary masses, greatly arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses. After the cadres went down, because they personally participated in revolutionary practice, they further absorbed nutrients from the masses, and generally reflected: their ears became more sensitive, their minds became clearer, their eyes became brighter, their confidence became stronger, their enthusiasm became greater, and they became closer to the masses. They further tasted the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and decided to be the students of the masses for life.

    工作越有成绩  越要严格要求自己  群众越是信任  越要密切联系群众
    伊春木材水解厂革委会中五名革命领导干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，一直同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗。现在他们更加严格要求自己，处处起骨干作用
    据新华社哈尔滨二十七日电　黑龙江省伊春市木材水解厂的革命领导干部，牢记毛主席关于“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大教导，在被选入“三结合”的革命委员会以后，更加严格要求自己，密切联系群众，处处起骨干作用，为建设革命化的联系群众的领导班子做出了新贡献。
    这个厂选入厂革命委员会的五名革命领导干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，一直同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，出了力，立了功。由于革命群众的信任，厂革命委员会一成立，他们就被选进了革命“三结合”的领导班子，有的还当上了正副主任。进入革命“三结合”的领导班子以后应该怎样继续前进？这些革命领导干部认真学习了毛主席的有关教导，认识到：革命委员会成立后，党和人民向革命领导干部提出了更高的要求。如果停滞不前，靠老本吃饭，那就必然会脱离群众，甚至走到邪路上去。因此，他们认为，工作越有成绩，越要严格要求自己；群众越是信任，越要密切联系群众。只有这样，才能更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，朝气勃勃地跟上形势发展的需要。
    认识提高以后，他们在工作千头万绪的情况下，坚持把活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好思想革命化，放在第一位，自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，自觉地到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心。今年二月，混进厂内的一小撮地、富、反、坏分子，刮起了一阵反革命经济主义和右倾翻案妖风，蒙骗一部分群众，妄图整垮新诞生的革命委员会。面对这一情况，怎么办？革命领导干部、厂革委会副主任曾经一闪而过地产生过怕引火上身的想法。当他想到毛主席“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导，马上意识到这是“私”字在头脑里作怪。他当即抛弃私心杂念，迎着阶级斗争的风浪，挺身而出，到群众中去，一面揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋；一面向受蒙蔽的群众大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入细致的思想政治工作。受蒙蔽的群众很快觉悟过来，反戈一击，使阶级敌人的丑恶面貌现形于光天化日之下。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。这个厂的革命领导干部牢记毛主席的伟大教导，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，始终保持着普通劳动者的本色。他们虽然在革委会里担负着重要的领导工作，可是到了机关，就亲自打水、扫地、倒痰盂，是个普通的勤务员；下到车间，和工人一起锯木料，扛板皮，是个普通的劳动者；回到家里，和自己的妻子、儿女坐在一条炕上活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，又是家庭毛泽东思想学习班的普通学员。有一位革命领导干部过去就经常深入到车间里向工人宣传毛泽东思想，传达毛主席的最新指示。进入“三结合”领导班子以后，他觉得这样做还不够，身子深入群众了，思想还没有真正深入群众，有时还是自己说的多，向群众学习少。之后，他每次下车间，首先不是自己先说什么，而是先拜群众为师，虚心向群众学习；带头亮私斗私，主动地把心交给群众，努力做到想群众之所想，急群众之所急，帮群众之所需。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”这个厂的革命领导干部从毛主席的这一伟大教导中深刻认识到：革委会中的革命群众代表来自群众，最了解群众，最熟悉群众，最能反映群众的意见和呼声，是群众利益的代表者。革命领导干部接受群众的批评、监督，首先就要接受革命群众代表的批评和监督。因此，革委会每次讨论研究革命、生产的重大问题时，总要拿出相当充裕的时间，让革命群众代表发表意见，只要说得对，那怕点点滴滴，也要及时采纳过来。有的革命群众代表因事外出，革命领导干部还把会上讨论的问题转告他，有什么意见请他个别提出。这样做，不仅使革命领导干部避免了工作上的偏差、错误，而且更加深了对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚感情。革命委员会成立之初，有的革命领导干部忙于蹲在上面抓事务，群众对此提出了批评。革命领导干部当即到群众中去，带头亮私斗私，广泛征求革命群众的意见和批评，极大地激发了广大革命群众的革命热情。干部下去以后，由于亲身参加革命实践，进一步从群众中吸取了营养，普遍反映：耳朵灵了，脑子清了，眼睛亮了，信心足了，干劲大了，和群众更亲了。他们进一步尝到了毛主席革命路线的甜头，决心一辈子做群众的小学生。
