Follow the great teacher Chairman Mao, achieve victory in both revolution and production – a red flag of revolution and production on the coal industry front: the eighth brigade of the Taozhuang Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong

Editor's Note: The advanced collective of the coal industry front, the Eighth Brigade, has created outstanding achievements during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which are worth learning from.

Chairman Mao highly praised the proletariat, pointing out: "In the revolutionary struggle, they are more resolute and thorough than any other class." The revolutionary miners of the Eighth Brigade have always stood at the forefront of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They have consistently grasped the revolution and promoted production. They are indeed revolutionary pioneers and production models.

The production front is an important battlefield for class struggle. The reality of class struggle proves: a handful of class enemies often incite and utilize anarchist trends to disrupt the revolutionary new order, disrupt normal labor discipline, disrupt production, and ultimately achieve the evil goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary workers of the Eighth Brigade, who have a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, clearly understand this. Under any circumstances, they firmly guard their production posts, observe labor discipline, and insist on the eight-hour workday. With their outstanding achievements in grasping the revolution and promoting production, they have repelled the challenges of a handful of class enemies.

From the glorious fighting history of the Eighth Brigade, we see the precious qualities of the working class being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Let us learn from the heroic example of the Eighth Brigade comrades and do better in both revolution and production!

On May 20, it was the happiest day for the revolutionary workers of the Eighth Brigade of the Taozhuang Coal Mine. On this day, our great teacher Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the representatives of the brigade who were attending the coal mine revolution and production conference in Beijing. This heartening news quickly spread to the mine. The comrades of the Eighth Brigade who were working underground were greatly encouraged and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They immediately held a meeting underground. Everyone vowed to forever be good workers of Chairman Mao and to achieve greater results in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

The Eighth Brigade is a famous advanced collective on the coal industry front. In 1956, our great teacher Chairman Mao received the representatives of the main tunnel excavation team attending the national coal industry front heroes' conference and took a photo with them. This most glorious and happy reception has always been a great motivating force for the comrades of the Eighth Brigade. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they followed Chairman Mao closely, insisted on the direction of the struggle, and showed the deep class feelings of the working class's infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao. They worked hard, went up the mine to make revolution, and went down the mine to produce. Not only did they overfulfill their tasks month after month, but the quality of their projects also continued to improve. After completing the state plan 27 days ahead of schedule last year, they completed their production tasks 14 days ahead of schedule in the first quarter of this year, achieving outstanding results in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

The fundamental reason why the Eighth Brigade has achieved outstanding results in revolution and production is that they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Defending Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line, Not Wavering for a Moment

Whenever the critical moments of class struggle come, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade use Chairman Mao's instructions to "set the direction" for themselves.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. The workers said: Whatever Chairman Mao says, we workers will do. We must stand at the forefront of the struggle and not waver for a moment. From the beginning, they directed the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, using big-character posters to fiercely expose and criticize the crimes of these bad guys in suppressing revolutionary masses, promoting material incentives, and restoring capitalism.

When the handful of capitalist roaders within the mine saw that this model brigade, which had a great influence among the workers, was rebelling against them, they were extremely panicked and tried every means to pull the Eighth Brigade to the right. They first instructed some people to use "old superiors," "old comrades," and "old fellow villagers" to "persuade" them, and later threatened the cadres and party members of the brigade, saying things like, "In the later stages of the movement, they will crack down on the rightists. Do you not want to be cadres? Do you not want the title of Communist Party member?" However, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade firmly replied: "We are a working-class team cultivated by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution. For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea, and we will not retreat until death!" After the capitalist roaders' plots failed miserably, they tried to deceive some people to attack the comrades of the Eighth Brigade on one hand, and on the other hand, they personally took to the field to force the comrades of the Eighth Brigade to withdraw from the revolutionary rebel organization, attempting to crush this advanced fighting collective. However, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade were fearless in the face of high pressure and insisted on fighting.

"The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never resign themselves to their defeat." Seeing that neither soft nor hard methods could make the comrades of the Eighth Brigade yield, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party changed their tactics and created various difficulties for the Eighth Brigade in production, attempting to pin the blame of "affecting production" on the Eighth Brigade. They repeatedly created difficulties for the comrades of the Eighth Brigade in production and deliberately increased the daily production plan. However, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade overfulfilled the production plan. Seeing this plan fail, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party adopted an even more sinister trick: they did not issue the delayed detonators needed for the Eighth Brigade's blasting, increasing the number of blasts from once to five to seven times and the blasting time from fifteen minutes to one and a half to two hours. They tried to use such despicable means to make the Eighth Brigade fail to complete the task. The comrades of the Eighth Brigade, in order to expose their tricks, studied together Chairman Mao's quotation: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy." Chairman Mao's teachings made their revolutionary will even more firm. Old worker Zhu Pingyu, amidst the smoke from the blasts, led everyone to charge forward, making full use of the time to work. After five consecutive blasts, he was overcome by the smoke. Comrades wanted to send him up the mine, but he shouted loudly: "Don't bother with me. Chairman Mao is backing us up. We must fight for Chairman Mao's glory and quickly go to continue blasting!" He struggled to stand up and ran to the front to continue loading the blasts. This heroic selfless spirit further inspired everyone's determination to overcome difficulties and fight to the end with the class enemy. Young worker He Qingyu proposed: "If we don't get the delayed detonators, we'll find a way ourselves." He and other workers discussed and improved the blasting method, reducing the number of blasts by nearly half, ensuring the completion of tasks on time and on schedule.

Executing Chairman Mao's Instructions, Not Deviating by an Inch

The comrades of the Eighth Brigade responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, insisting on using revolution to lead and promote production, and determined to be models of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

The comrades of the Eighth Brigade remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening discipline and resolutely implemented the eight-hour workday, conducting production with the high sense of responsibility of the masters of the state. Last year, the reactionary anarchist trend once invaded the Taozhuang Coal Mine. After discovering this sign, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade immediately studied Chairman Mao's "Opposing Liberalism" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and through reminiscences and comparisons, raised their class consciousness. Everyone realized that the anarchist trend is incompatible with the working class's high organizational discipline and must be resolutely opposed. They must carry forward the fine traditions of the working class and become models of observing labor discipline. Many old workers said: In the old society, we used the method of "working slowly" to resist the exploitation and oppression of the capitalists. This was a means of class struggle. Now we are the masters of the state and serve the people. If we do not work hard, we are helping the class enemies and forgetting our roots, and we are disloyal to Chairman Mao. The words of the old workers moved everyone. All the workers in the brigade voluntarily observed labor discipline, worked full shifts, and worked full points. Everyone strove to be a model of grasping the revolution and promoting production. Once, during excavation, the dripping water from above soaked the clothes of many comrades. The brigade leader wanted everyone to complete the task and go up the mine early, but the workers insisted on staying. They said: Although our plan is completed, the requirement of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to insist on the eight-hour workday has not been met. We will execute Chairman Mao's instructions and must not deviate by an inch.

The comrades of the Eighth Brigade resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "hard work and plain living." After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in the Taozhuang Coal Mine, the class enemies once incited those who did not understand the truth to create economic issues, saying things like "exchanging old work clothes for new ones is also a framework, and it must be thoroughly smashed." The comrades of the Eighth Brigade studied Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle and realized that this was a manifestation of class struggle in the new situation. Old worker Liu Maoyuan mended his old work clothes again and again. Under his influence, twelve comrades in the brigade did not take new work clothes at that time. When seasonal supplies were issued, many comrades in the Eighth Brigade voluntarily took the old ones and let the new ones go to other units. Their actions had a good influence throughout the mine. As early as 1965, they had resolutely fought against the material incentives and other revisionist things promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. That year in May, the entire brigade sealed the overproduction bonus and sent it back to the accounting room without taking a penny. However, some people said that doing so would affect other work areas. The comrades of the Eighth Brigade were as firm as steel, and in June and July, they still did not take the overproduction bonus. Many comrades in the mine were deeply moved, saying: "The thoughts of the comrades in the Eighth Brigade are indeed firm. This is Mao Zedong Thought taking root in their minds."

The comrades of the Eighth Brigade also resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," and practiced increased production and thrift. They said that whether to be thrifty or wasteful is an important aspect of the current struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They were determined to fight this political battle in the economic field. A drill bit, a block of explosive, a section of detonating cord, they all paid great attention to saving. They used old machines instead of new ones, repaired broken ones and used them again. The waste underground, everyone picked it up, and some comrades brought brooms down the mine to sweep coal. Since last year, the Eighth Brigade alone has swept up 408 carts of floating coal for the state. They also found various ways to save 11,000 meters of detonating cord, 200 meters of water pipes, and 504 drill bits, saving a large amount of funds for the state.

Because the comrades of the Eighth Brigade resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and grasped class struggle, they effectively promoted production. Last August, they completed 105 meters of excavation, and production has been rising month by month since then. The same people, due to the change in their spiritual outlook, completed 326 meters in April this year, making an important contribution to socialist construction.

Actively Learning and Applying Mao Zedong Thought, Not Relaxing by a Word or a Sentence

"The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The comrades of the Eighth Brigade were able to navigate through the stormy waves of class struggle and achieve outstanding results in grasping the revolution and promoting production, mainly because they took their infinite loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao as the foundation of the brigade. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, the comrades of the Eighth Brigade studied Mao Zedong's works even more eagerly, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. In studying Mao Zedong's works, they carefully understood every sentence and every word and resolutely implemented them in action. Some old workers who were illiterate not only actively asked comrades to help them study in the brigade but also found their children to help them read at home. They measured their every word and deed against their loyalty to Chairman Mao, integrating the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the entire production process. The comrades of the Eighth Brigade, before going down the mine every day, would choose Chairman Mao's quotations based on the brigade's ideological situation and work tasks for serious study. During production, everyone honestly followed Chairman Mao's instructions. After work, they seriously checked and compared themselves, summing up and improving based on Chairman Mao's instructions. When personal interests conflicted with revolutionary interests, they thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of serving the people wholeheartedly and compared their thoughts; when encountering difficulties in production, they thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and compared their resolve to overcome difficulties. The comrades of the Eighth Brigade thus consciously tempered their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The comrades of the Eighth Brigade, with their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, truly regarded the "Three Articles" as their motto, consciously criticized and repudiated themselves, and turned the Eighth Brigade into a furnace of "publicness." They said: "If you forgive a little private heart, you will let loose the enemy in your thoughts; if you retain a little private heart, it is like retaining a time bomb." Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains became their constant examples to learn from. "Completely," "thoroughly," two "extremes," and "selflessly serving the people" were their constant self-disciplinary sayings. Therefore, the spirit of selfless labor for the public good became prevalent in the Eighth Brigade, and many advanced deeds emerged. Old worker Wei Di'an was a typical example of not calculating time, not calculating remuneration, and selflessly working for the public. His ancestors and grandchildren had begged for food, and he always remembered the class bitterness. He often used the brilliant "Three Articles" to compare and examine his words and deeds, often going down the mine early and coming up late. Wherever the mine needed him, he went down. He worked in the work area, ate in the work area, and slept in the work area. Sometimes he forgot to eat, bringing the food he took down back up the mine. Comrades said: "Wei Di'an has no private heart towards revolutionary work."

Old worker Liu Xianfu's spirit of extreme responsibility for work was also praised by everyone. Once, there was a protruding lump on the roof of the tunnel. Some cadres thought that although it looked a bit ugly, it did not affect the quality inspection. However, Liu Xianfu drilled three blast holes on this lump and blew it up. He said: "We are building socialism. We workers are the masters of the state. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All products, not only seek quantity but also seek quality...', we cannot just pass, we must pass with flying colors." His spirit of meticulousness for the revolution had a great educational effect on the entire brigade. Everyone took Liu Xianfu as an example, paying attention to improving work quality, and every month's work quality inspection was of the first class. Liu Xianfu also took on the heaviest burdens. The leadership saw that he was old and weak, and the work he did was the most labor-intensive drilling in the excavation operation, wanting to transfer him to a lighter job. He refused to do so. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does.' If you want me to do other work, it's fine, but it must be heavier than the current work, then I'll go." The workers all said: "Liu Xianfu is indeed a socialist 'old yellow cow' who works wholeheartedly for the revolution."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given the Eighth Brigade a comprehensive and profound examination and test. In the stormy winds of class struggle, this red flag on the national coal front has become even more vibrant and magnificent. Under the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they jointly made a resolute vow to Chairman Mao:

The workers of the Eighth Brigade are unwavering, step by step following Chairman Mao;
Criticizing and repudiating the self, being the vanguard, creating miracles in revolution and production;
Executing Chairman Mao's instructions without deviation, vowing to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    紧跟伟大导师毛主席，革命生产双胜利
    煤炭工业战线上一面抓革命促生产的红旗——山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿永强八队
    编者按：全国煤炭工业战线上的著名先进集体永强八队，在无产阶级文化大革命中所创造的先进事迹，值得大家学习。
    毛主席高度评价无产阶级时指出：“他们在革命斗争中，比任何别的阶级来得坚决和彻底”。永强八队的革命矿工，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，一直站在斗争的最前列，坚持抓革命，促生产。他们不愧是革命的闯将，生产的模范。
    生产战线是阶级斗争的一个重要阵地。阶级斗争的现实证明：一小撮阶级敌人，往往煽动和利用无政府主义思潮，破坏革命的新秩序，破坏正常的劳动纪律，破坏生产，最后达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。有着高度革命警惕性的永强八队的革命职工，清楚地认识到这一点。他们在任何情况下，都坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，坚持八小时工作制，用抓革命促生产的优异成绩，回击了一小撮阶级敌人的挑战。
    从永强八队的光荣战斗历程中，我们看到了工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的可贵品质。让我们学习永强八队同志的英雄榜样，把革命和生产搞得更好！
    五月二十日，是枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿永强八队革命职工最幸福的日子。这一天，我们的伟大导师毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见了这个队正在北京参加煤矿抓革命、促生产会议的代表。这个振奋人心的消息，很快就传到了矿井。正在矿井下生产的永强八队的同志们受到了极大的鼓舞，一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁，毛主席万万岁！”并且立即在井下召开了会议。大家决心永远做毛主席的好工人，在抓革命促生产中做出更大的成绩来。
    永强八队是煤炭工业战线上全国著名的先进集体。一九五六年，我们伟大的导师毛主席曾接见了这个出席全国煤炭工业战线群英会的大巷道掘进队的代表，并在一起照了相。这一次最光荣、最幸福的接见，一直成为激励和鼓舞八队同志们前进的巨大动力。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们紧跟毛主席，坚持斗争的大方向，表现了工人阶级对毛主席无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情。他们鼓足干劲，上井搞革命，下井搞生产，不仅月月超额完成任务，而且工程质量不断提高。去年提前二十七天完成国家计划后，今年第一季度又提前十四天完成了生产任务，在抓革命促生产中做出了出色的成绩。
    永强八队所以在革命和生产中获得优异成绩，最根本的原因是他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    捍卫毛主席的革命路线，一时一刻不动摇
    每当阶级斗争的关键时刻，永强八队的同志们都要用毛主席的指示来为自己“定向”。
    无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他们反复学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”。工人们说：毛主席怎么说，我们工人就怎么做。一定要站在斗争最前列，一时一刻不动摇。他们一开始就把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派，用大字报狠揭狠批这些坏家伙镇压革命群众、大搞物质刺激和复辟资本主义的罪行。
    矿区党内一小撮走资派一见这个在工人中有很大影响的标兵队起来造他们的反，非常恐慌，便千方百计妄图把八队拉向右转。他们先是指使一些人用“老上级”、“老同志”、“老同乡”等关系来“劝说”，后来又威胁这个队的干部和党员，胡说什么“运动后期是要抓右派的，难道你们不想当干部了，共产党员的称号也不想要了？”但是永强八队的同志坚定地回答：“我们是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想培育出来的工人阶级队伍，我们跟着毛主席干革命是跟定了。为了保卫毛主席，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，至死不回头！”党内走资派的阴谋伎俩遭到可耻的失败以后，一面蒙蔽一部分人对八队的同志进行围攻，一面自己赤膊上阵，威逼八队的同志退出革命造反派组织，妄图摧垮这个先进的战斗集体。但是八队的同志在高压面前毫不畏惧，坚持战斗。
    “帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败”。党内一小撮走资派看到用软的硬的办法都不能使八队的同志屈服，就改变手法，从生产上给八队制造种种困难，企图把“影响生产”的罪名强加到八队头上。他们一次又一次给八队的同志在生产上制造困难，故意提高日进计划。但是，八队的同志在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，超额完成了生产计划。此计不成，党内一小撮走资派又采取了更加阴险的一招：不发给八队掘进放炮时需要的延期雷管，使放炮次数由一次增加到五至七次，放炮时间由十五分钟增加到一个半到两个小时。他们妄图用这样的卑鄙手段，使八队完不成任务。八队的同志们为了揭穿他们的鬼把戏，大家在一起学习毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的教导，使他们的革命意志更加坚定。老工人朱平玉在炮烟还未散时，就带领大家往里冲，充分利用时间进行工作。他在连续五次放炮后，被炮烟熏倒了。同志们要把他送上井，他却大声地说：“别管我，毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气，赶快去继续放炮！”他用力站起来，跑到前面继续装炮去了。这种英勇的忘我精神，更加激发了大家战胜困难、与阶级敌人斗争到底的决心。青年工人贺庆玉提出：“不给延期雷管，我们自己想办法。”他同其他工人一起商量，改进了放炮方法，放炮次数减少将近一半，保证了按班、按日完成任务。
    执行毛主席的指示，一丝一毫不走样
    八队的同志坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚持以革命统帅生产，带动生产，决心做抓革命促生产的模范。
    八队的同志牢记毛主席关于加强纪律性的教导，坚决执行八小时工作制，以国家主人翁的高度责任感来进行生产。去年，反动的无政府主义思潮曾一度侵袭陶庄煤矿。八队的同志发现这个苗头后，马上学习了毛主席的《反对自由主义》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，并通过回忆对比，提高了阶级觉悟。大家认识到，无政府主义思潮与工人阶级高度的组织纪律性是水火不相容的，一定要坚决反对。要发扬工人阶级的优良传统，成为遵守劳动纪律的模范。不少老工人说：我们在旧社会用“磨洋工”的办法，来反抗资本家的剥削压迫，这是阶级斗争的一种手段。现在我们是国家的主人，是为人民服务的，如果不好好工作，就是帮了阶级敌人的忙，就是忘本，就是对毛主席不忠。老工人这些话使大家很受感动。全队职工自觉遵守劳动纪律，出满勤，干满点。人人争当抓革命、促生产的模范。有一次掘进时，头顶上的淋水，把不少同志的衣服打湿了。队干部要大家完成任务后提前上井，但职工们坚持不肯。他们说：我们计划虽然完了，但是毛主席、党中央号召我们坚持八小时工作制的要求还没有达到。我们执行毛主席指示，一定要一丝一毫不走样。
    八队的同志坚决贯彻毛主席“艰苦奋斗”的指示。陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派掌权以后，阶级敌人曾挑动不明真相的人闹经济主义，说什么“工作服以旧换新也是框框，要彻底砸烂”等等。八队的同志学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，认识到这是在新形势下阶级斗争的一种表现。老工人刘茂远把旧工作服补了又补。在他的影响下，全队有十二个同志当时都没有领新工作服。发季节用品的时候，八队许多同志就主动要旧的，而把新的让给其它单位。他们的行动在全矿产生了很好的影响。早在一九六五年，他们就对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的物质刺激等修正主义的东西，进行过坚决的斗争。那年五月全队把超产奖金集中封好，一文不取地送回会计室。但是有人却说什么这样做会影响其它工区。八队的同志意志如钢，六、七月还是照样不拿超产奖金。矿上许多同志很受感动，说：“八队同志的思想确实过得硬，这是毛泽东思想在他们头脑中扎了根。”
    八队的同志还坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，厉行增产节约。他们说，是勤俭节约，还是铺张浪费，这是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。他们决心在经济领域内打好这场政治仗，一个钻头，一块炸药，一节炮线，都十分注意节省。机器有旧的不用新的，坏了的修好了再用。井下的废料，大家见了就拣，有些同志带着条帚下井扫煤。去年以来，仅八队就给国家扫起浮煤四百零八车。他们还千方百计节约了炮线一万一千米，水管二百米，钻头五百零四个，为国家节省了大量经费。
    八队的同志由于坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的指示，狠抓阶级斗争，有力地促进了生产。去年八月掘进完成了一百零五米，以后生产逐月上升。人还是这些人，由于精神面貌的变化，今年四月份完成了三百二十六米，为社会主义建设做出了重要贡献。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，一字一句不放松
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。八队的同志所以能够在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中不迷航，在抓革命促生产中作出了突出的成绩，最重要的是他们把对伟大导师毛主席的无限忠心作为建队的根本。在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，八队的同志更加如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，促进了思想革命化。他们在学习毛主席著作时，对每句话每个字都认真领会，坚决落实到行动上。有些老工人不识字，他们不但在队里积极请同志们帮助学，回到家里还找儿女帮他们念。他们把自己的一切言行提到对毛主席忠不忠的高度来衡量，把活学活用毛泽东思想贯穿在整个生产过程中。八队的同志每天下井之前，都要根据本队的思想情况和工作任务，选择毛主席的语录，进行认真学习。生产时，大家老老实实按毛主席的指示去做。收工以后，就严肃地进行检查对照，根据毛主席的指示总结提高。当个人利益同革命利益发生矛盾时，就想一想毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，对照一下自己的思想；当生产上碰到困难的时候，就想一想毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，对照一下自己有没有克服困难的坚强意志。八队的同志就是这样自觉地磨炼自己对毛主席的无限忠心。
    八队的同志怀着对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情，把“老三篇”真正作为座右铭来学，自觉地斗私批修，使八队变成“公”字的熔炉。他们说：“原谅一点私心，就会放走了思想上的敌人；保留一点私心，就是保留一颗定时炸弹。”张思德、白求恩、老愚公这三个光辉形象成为他们经常学习的榜样。“完全”、“彻底”，两个“极端”，“毫不利己专门利人”是他们经常用来律己的格言。因此，一心为公、忘我劳动的革命精神在永强八队蔚然成风，先进事迹大量涌现。老工人魏殿安就是一个不计时间、不计报酬、为公忘私的典型。他祖孙三代要过饭，阶级苦牢记在心。他经常用光辉的“老三篇”来对照检查自己的言行，经常早下井，晚上井。井下什么时候需要，他就什么时候下井。他干在工区，吃在工区，睡在工区。有时他忘记了吃饭，把带下去的饭又带上井来。同志们说：“魏殿安同志对待革命工作没有半点私心。”
    老工人刘现福对工作极端负责任的精神，更是人人称赞。有一次，巷道顶上有个突出的疙瘩，有的干部看后认为虽然说难看点，还不影响质量检查。可是刘现福在这个疙瘩上却打了三个炮眼，把它炸掉了。他说：“我们干的是社会主义建设，我们工人阶级是国家的主人，毛主席教导我们：‘一切产品，不但求数量多，而且求质量好……’，我们不能只求过得去，必须过得硬。”他这种为革命一丝不苟的精神，对全队同志教育很大。大家都以刘现福为榜样，注意提高工作质量，以后每月检查工作质量时都是一等品。刘现福还处处拣重担子挑。领导上见他年大体弱，干的又是掘进作业中最吃力的打眼活，想给他调换一个轻点的工作。他怎么也不干。他说，“毛主席教导我们：‘越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。’你们要我干别的工作也行，但必须比现在的活还要重，我才去。”工人们都说：“刘现福真是一心为革命的社会主义的‘老黄牛’。”
    无产阶级文化大革命对永强八队进行了一次最全面、最深刻的检查和考验。在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中，全国煤炭战线上的这面红旗显得更加鲜红、更加壮丽了。在当前无产阶级文化大革命一派大好形势下，他们共同向毛主席发出了铿锵有力的誓言：
    八队职工志不移，步步紧跟毛主席；
    斗私批修当尖兵，革命生产创奇迹；
    执行毛主席指示不走样，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利！　本报记者
