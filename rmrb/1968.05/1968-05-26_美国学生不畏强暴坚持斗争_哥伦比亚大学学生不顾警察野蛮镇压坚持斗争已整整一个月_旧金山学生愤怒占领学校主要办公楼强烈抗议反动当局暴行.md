American students, undeterred by the brutal suppression of the reactionary ruling clique, continue their struggle against Johnson's government's racist policies and the use of colleges and universities to serve the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam.

In New York City, Columbia University students have been protesting the school administration's racial discrimination and demanding that the school sever ties with the Department of Defense's war research institutions for an entire month. On the night of the 21st, to protest the school administration's summons and threats to expel several student leaders, about 200 students occupied a school building, while others built barricades and blocked the school gates. The reactionary ruling clique, terrified of the students' actions, deployed over a thousand police to brutally suppress the students. In the early hours of the 22nd, police stormed the campus, wielding batons to beat students, who retaliated with stones. One hundred seventy-eight students were arrested. To support their arrested comrades, over 2,000 students passionately demonstrated on campus. They set fires, smashed windows, threw stones at police, and destroyed three police cars.

School President Kirk later exclaimed at a press conference, "The student rebellion has become a political action, far beyond just dissatisfaction with the school administration." He also menacingly threatened to expel students, attempting to suppress the burgeoning student movement.

The protesting students gave a strong response to Kirk's threats. One of their leaders said at a meeting attended by over a thousand students that night: "We will not let Kirk or anyone else lead us around. We have only one thing to say now, that is, to go on strike."

In the city of San Francisco, on the west coast, about 400 to 500 students held a sit-in demonstration on the night of the 21st in the administrative building of San Francisco State College, demanding that the college enroll more Black and Puerto Rican students and that the Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps be removed from the campus. Police beat several students with batons and arrested 26 demonstrators. The reactionary authorities' brutality sparked even greater anger among the students. Undeterred by the violence, the students reoccupied the college's main administrative building on the 22nd.

In Maryland, where the Black population is the majority, 500 students at a state college held a demonstration to protest the discrimination against Blacks by capitalists.

    旧金山学生愤怒占领学校主要办公楼强烈抗议反动当局暴行
    新华社二十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国各地进步学生不顾反动统治集团的野蛮镇压，继续坚持斗争，反对约翰逊政府的种族歧视政策以及利用大专院校为美帝国主义的侵越战争效劳的罪恶活动。
    在纽约市的哥伦比亚大学，学生群众抗议校方种族歧视、要求校方同国防部的战争研究机构断绝关系的斗争已经坚持了整整一个月。二十一日晚上，为了抗议学校当局传讯并且威胁要开除几名示威学生的领袖，大约两百名学生占领了学校的一座大楼，另外一些学生筑起障碍物、封锁了校门。反动统治集团对学生的行动怕得要命，又出动千余名警察进行疯狂镇压。警察二十二日凌晨闯入校园，挥动警棍殴打学生，学生用石块英勇还击。有一百七十八名学生被捕。为了声援被捕同学，两千多名学生群情激昂地在校园内举行了示威。他们在几处放火、砸玻璃窗、扔石块同警察搏斗，捣毁了三辆警车。
    大学校长柯克事后在记者招待会上惊呼，“学生的造反已经成为政治行动，远远超出了仅仅是对学校当局不满的范围。”他还凶相毕露地以开除学籍相威胁，妄图把高涨的学生运动镇压下去。
    示威学生对柯克的威胁给了有力的回答。他们的一个负责人当天晚上在有一千多名示威学生参加的集会上说：“我们不会让柯克或任何别的人牵着我们转了。我们现在只有一句话要说，那就是罢课。”
    在离纽约三千英里之外的西海岸城市旧金山，四五百名学生二十一日晚上在旧金山州立学院的行政大楼举行静坐示威，要求学院招收更多的黑人和波多黎各人，要求空军后备军官训练队迁出校园。警察用警棍打伤一些学生，并且逮捕了二十六名示威者。反动当局的暴行，激起了学生更强烈的愤怒。学生们不畏强暴，二十二日又重新占领了学院的主要办公楼房。
    在黑人居民占多数的马里兰州，州立学院的五百名学生举行示威，抗议资本家对黑人的歧视。
