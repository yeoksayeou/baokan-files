The British Hong Kong authorities are obstructing the delivery of 5,000 tons of rice intended to comfort patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting the Patriotic Struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots strongly condemns this unreasonable behavior by the British authorities.

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, May 4th: A spokesperson for the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting the Patriotic Struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots issued a statement today, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for unreasonably obstructing the delivery of 5,000 tons of rice allocated by the committee to comfort patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The spokesperson said that in January of this year, the committee decided to allocate 5,000 tons of rice to be distributed to patriotic workers and other compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon during the Spring Festival as a gesture of comfort. To ensure that this batch of comfort rice could be delivered to Hong Kong as soon as possible, we had previously approached the British authorities in Hong Kong through normal channels. However, after several months of repeated negotiations, the British authorities not only failed to make prompt arrangements but also took an extremely unreasonable attitude, creating numerous obstacles and delays, resulting in the inability of this batch of comfort rice to reach Hong Kong to this day.

The spokesperson pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong had to acknowledge verbally that this batch of rice is of a comfort nature and non-commercial, and expressed their willingness to approve it as "non-commercial cargo for import." However, they created various excuses to deliberately obstruct and insist on treating this batch of comfort rice as commercial rice, attempting to erase the political significance of these 5,000 tons of comfort rice. This is absolutely unacceptable.

The spokesperson, in connection with the British authorities' unreasonable rejection of the Guangdong Provincial Red Cross Society's allocation of 1,000 sets of winter clothing for compatriots still in prison; their continuous arrests and persecution of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon; and their recent obstruction and sabotage of the demands for workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon to return to work, pointed out that this only shows that the British authorities' expressed desire to ease the situation in Hong Kong is completely hypocritical.

The spokesperson solemnly declared that the 5,000 tons of rice donated by our committee is comfort rice for patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and is absolutely not commercial rice. The British authorities' insistence on importing it through commercial channels is utterly unreasonable and unacceptable to us. However, we can consider delivering the 5,000 tons of comfort rice in installments over time. The British authorities must immediately stop obstructing the entry of these 5,000 tons of comfort rice into Hong Kong and promptly make appropriate arrangements. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be the responsibility of the British authorities.

　　港英阻挠我慰问爱国同胞的五千吨大米运港
　　广东省支港委员会强烈谴责港英的无理行径
    新华社广州四日电　广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会发言人今天发表谈话，强烈谴责港英当局无理阻挠该委员会为慰问港九爱国同胞而拨发的五千吨大米运往香港。
    发言人说，今年一月，我会决定在春节期间拨发大米五千吨，分发给我港九爱国工人和其他爱国同胞，以示慰问。为使这批慰问米能够尽快地运往香港，我们曾经通过正常途径，向香港英国当局提出交涉。但是，经过几个月的反复交涉，港英当局不仅不从速作出安排，反而采取极端无理的态度，百般进行刁难和阻挠，致使这批慰问米迄今不能运抵香港。
    发言人指出，港英当局口头上不得不承认这批大米是慰问性质的，是非商业性的，并且表示准备作为“非商业运货批准这种进口”。但它却又制造种种借口，故意刁难，硬要把这批慰问米实际上变为商业米，妄图抹杀这五千吨慰问米的政治意义。这是绝对办不到的。
    发言人联系到港英当局无理拒绝我广东省红十字会给尚在狱中的难胞拨发寒衣一千套；对我港九爱国同胞不断进行新的拘捕和迫害；最近竟又对我港九罢工工人的复工要求进行阻挠和破坏等事实指出，这只能表明香港英国当局所表示的要缓和香港局势的愿望，完全是虚伪的。
    发言人严正声明，我会所捐赠的五千吨大米是慰问港九爱国同胞的慰问米，绝不是什么商业米，港英当局坚持要通过商业途径入口是毫无道理的，是我们所不能同意的。但是我们可以考虑将五千吨慰问米分期分批地陆续运往香港。港英当局必须立即停止阻挠这五千吨慰问米进入香港，从速作出妥善安排。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，均应由港英当局承担。
