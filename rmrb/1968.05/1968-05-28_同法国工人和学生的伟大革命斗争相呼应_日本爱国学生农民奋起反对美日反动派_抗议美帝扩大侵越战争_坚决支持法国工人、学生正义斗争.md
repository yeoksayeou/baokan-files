In response to the powerful struggle launched by French workers and students, Japanese patriotic students and farmers of Sanrizuka on May 26 took to the streets to oppose the war policies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government.

Students at Tokyo University held a rally on May 26 in the campus, demanding reforms to the reactionary educational system and the revocation of unjust student expulsions. The students also strongly protested the university administration's collusion with the police to suppress students. They hoisted red flags atop the clock tower of the lecture hall and hung banners denouncing the reactionary university administration. They also held a demonstration at the school gate to prevent the police from entering the campus.

A student speaking at the rally strongly condemned the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' attempt to turn universities into tools for reviving Japanese militarism. He expressed firm support for the heroic struggle of French workers and students.

One student passionately declared, "The struggle of the French people and the Japanese people is a common struggle against imperialist rule. We share the same feelings with French workers and students. Let us unite more closely to launch a sustained and fierce attack on imperialism and modern revisionism."

A leader of the student movement said, "Under the inspiration of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the anti-U.S. struggle of the Japanese people has reached a new high. The mass struggles in France and other European countries, as well as in the United States, are surging forward. The armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have made tremendous progress. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the struggles of the peoples of the world will surely achieve victory."

Farmers in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, who are fighting against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport," along with more than 200 patriotic students, held a rally and demonstration on May 26 to protest against U.S. imperialism's escalation of the aggression in Vietnam. They once again engaged in a fierce battle with the reactionary armed police who came to suppress them. They also went to the Chiba Police Station to protest against the Sato government's brutal repression.

Tamura Kazuyoshi, a leader of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement, expressed firm support for the just struggle of French workers and students at the rally. He said, "The struggle of the revolutionary people of France shows us that the masses possess boundless revolutionary power. This struggle has greatly encouraged the struggle of the Japanese people."

Tamura emphasized, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the heroic anti-U.S. national salvation war of the Vietnamese people, the struggle of black people in the United States against violence, and the just struggle of the revolutionary people of France—all these tell us who we must rely on, who we must oppose, and who we must struggle against. We must learn from the people who are fighting, creatively apply their methods of struggle, to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan and overthrow the Japanese reactionaries." Tamura concluded, "Let us respond to Chairman Mao's call and launch a sustained and fierce struggle against the enemy!"

    新华社二十七日讯  据东方通讯社报道：同法国工人和学生掀起的强大斗争相呼应，日本爱国学生和三里塚农民二十六日展开反对美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府的战争政策的斗争。
    东京大学的爱国学生二十六日在校园里举行集会，要求改革反动的教学制度和取消无理开除学生的措施。学生们还强烈抗议大学当局勾结警察镇压学生的阴谋。学生们把红旗升到讲堂钟楼的顶上，并悬挂谴责反动大学当局的横幅标语。他们还在校门前举行示威，制止警察进入校园。
    在会上发言的学生强烈谴责美日反动派要把大学变成复活日本军国主义的工具的罪恶行径，并表示坚决支持法国工人和学生的英勇斗争。
    一位学生在会上慷慨激昂地说：“法国人民和日本人民的斗争，是反对帝国主义统治的共同斗争。我们同法国工人和学生具有同样的感情。让我们更加紧密地团结起来，对帝国主义和现代修正主义发动持久的猛烈的进攻。”
    一位学生运动的领导人说：在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，日本人民的反美斗争出现了新的高涨，法国和其他欧洲国家以及美国的群众斗争汹涌澎湃，亚非拉人民的武装斗争取得了巨大的进展。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，世界各国人民的斗争一定会取得胜利。
    正在进行反对修建“新东京国际机场”的千叶县三里塚农民和二百多名爱国学生，二十六日举行集会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争。他们又一次同前来镇压他们的反动武装警察展开了英勇的搏斗。他们还前往成田市警察局，抗议佐藤政府的野蛮镇压。
    三里塚农民运动领导人户村一作在集会上表示坚决支持法国工人和学生的正义斗争。他说：“法国革命人民的斗争，使我们看到，群众中间蕴藏着无穷的革命力量。这场斗争有力地鼓舞了日本人民的斗争。”
    户村强调说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，法国革命人民的正义斗争，所有这些都告诉我们必须依靠谁，必须反对谁，必须同谁作斗争。我们要向正在进行斗争中的人民学习，创造性地运用他们的斗争方法，以便把美帝国主义赶出日本，打倒日本反动派。”户村最后说：“让我们响应毛主席的号召，向敌人开展持久的、猛烈的斗争吧！”
