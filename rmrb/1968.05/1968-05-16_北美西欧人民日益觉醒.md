	Recently, in the United States and countries such as France, West Germany, and Italy, unprecedented and powerful student movements have erupted. Broad masses of young students, in their struggle for democratic rights, against the decaying bourgeois education system, against the reactionary domestic and foreign policies and fascist atrocities of the ruling clique, and against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam, have stepped out of their classrooms and taken to the streets to hold demonstrations and marches. They have engaged in fierce battles with reactionary police forces. Their struggles have caused the ruling authorities in these countries to panic. The storm of student movements that has arisen in the heart of the capitalist world is an important sign that the people of North America and Western Europe are becoming increasingly awakened, and it is also a manifestation of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie.

	North America and Western Europe are the political and economic centers of the capitalist world, regions where the rule and control of the international bourgeoisie are extremely strict. The ruling cliques in these countries have, for many years, used the leftovers from the banquet of exploiting their own people and the people of their colonies to buy off a small group of labor aristocrats, Social Democrats, and revisionists. They use these traitors and scabs to deceive the working people and dull their fighting spirit, thereby maintaining their reactionary rule. However, with the rapid development of the world revolutionary situation and the deepening of the overall crisis of capitalist politics and economics, all political forces in the world, including those in North America and Western Europe, are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. The class contradictions and class struggles in North America and Western Europe are thus becoming increasingly sharp under this situation.

	The widespread dissemination of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the great victory of China's Cultural Revolution, the brilliant achievements of the Albanian people's socialist revolution and socialist construction, the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and the fierce rise of the revolutionary storms of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all signify the advent of a new era of world revolution. At the same time, in North America and Western Europe, there is economic recession, stagnant production, and increasing poverty among the working people. The exploitation and oppression by the ruling class are becoming more severe, and the traitorous faces of Social Democrats and modern revisionists are fully exposed. The contrast between the two worlds and two sets of scenes has promoted the political awakening of the working people of North America and Western Europe, who are increasingly bravely joining the struggle against U.S. imperialism and monopoly capital, turning the imperialists' rear base into a new battlefield against imperialism.

	The young students of North America and Western Europe, as the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force, have joined this struggle with a fighting posture. Their struggles have fiercely impacted the rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, inspiring the fighting spirit of the broad masses of the people. The frenzied suppression by the ruling authorities of these countries can only make the broad masses of young people more clearly recognize that their enemy is the monopoly bourgeoisie, the entire capitalist system.

	The revolutionary peoples of the world and all progressive forces support the student movements in North America and Western Europe. The imperialists and all reactionary forces, however, hate them to the core and desperately oppose them. The revisionist clique of the Soviet Union has once again jumped out to play the role of counter-revolutionaries. They have even imitated the tone of the reactionary police, viciously attacking the Western European student movements as "riots" and "rebellious actions," openly defending the reactionaries of these countries. This further reveals that they are a bunch of complete traitors.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The rise of the student movement is bound to promote the rise of the entire people's movement." The young intellectuals of North America and Western Europe have already taken action. Their just struggles are gaining the support of people from all walks of life in their own countries. They will certainly find the correct path through repeated struggles, combining their struggles with the workers' and peasants' movements in their own countries, and uniting with all oppressed nations and peoples to make their contributions to the overthrow of imperialist reactionary rule.

    北美西欧人民日益觉醒
    本报评论员
    最近，在美国和法国、西德、意大利等国家，掀起了规模空前的强大的学生运动。广大青年学生为争取民主权利，反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，反对统治集团的内外反动政策和法西斯暴行，反对美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，纷纷跨出校门，走上街头举行示威游行，同反动军警展开了英勇的搏斗。他们的斗争，使这些国家的统治当局惊慌失措。在资本主义世界的心脏地区兴起的学生运动的风暴，是北美和西欧人民正在日益觉醒的一个重要标志，也是国际垄断资产阶级的反动统治更加不稳的表现。
    北美和西欧是资本主义世界的政治、经济的重心，是国际资产阶级的统治和控制极为严密的地区。这些国家的统治集团，多年来用它们剥削本国人民和殖民地人民的筵席上的一点残羹剩饭，收买一小撮工人贵族、社会民主党人和修正主义分子，利用这伙工贼、叛徒来欺骗劳动人民，麻痹他们的斗争意志，从而维护自己的反动统治。但是，随着世界革命形势的迅速发展和资本主义政治经济总危机的日益加深，世界上的各种政治力量，包括北美和西欧的各种政治力量在内，正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。北美和西欧的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，在这个局面下也就更加尖锐起来。
    伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，阿尔巴尼亚人民社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉成就，越南人民抗美救国斗争的辉煌胜利，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命风暴的猛烈兴起，标志着世界革命新时代的到来。而同时，在北美和西欧，却经济衰退，生产停滞，劳动人民更加贫困，统治阶级的剥削和压迫日益加重，社会民主党人和现代修正主义者的叛徒面目彻底暴露。两个世界、两种景象的对比，促使北美和西欧的劳动人民的政治觉悟日益提高，越来越勇猛地投入反对美帝国主义和垄断资本的斗争，把帝国主义的大后方，变成了反对帝国主义的新战场。
    北美和西欧的青年学生，作为整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量，以战斗的姿态投入了这个斗争。他们的斗争猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的统治，鼓舞了广大人民的斗争意志。这些国家统治当局的疯狂镇压，只能使广大青年更加清楚地认识到，他们的敌人是垄断资产阶级，是整个资本主义制度。
    世界革命人民和一切进步力量，都支持北美和西欧的学生运动。而帝国主义和一切反动势力却恨之入骨，拚命反对。苏修叛徒集团又一次跳出来扮演了反革命的角色。他们竟然学着反动派警察局的腔调，恶毒攻击西欧学生运动是什么“骚乱”和“叛乱行动”，公然为这些国家的反动派张目。这就更加表明他们是一伙十足的叛徒。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席曾经指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”北美和西欧的知识青年已经纷纷行动起来，他们的正义斗争正在得到本国各阶层人民的支持。他们必将在反复的斗争实践中找到正确的道路，使自己的斗争同本国的工人运动和农民运动相结合，并同一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民联合起来，为推翻帝国主义反动统治作出自己的贡献。
