The return-to-work "agreement" is trampled underfoot; the French revisionist traitors are thrown aside. The angry tide of the workers' and students' struggle in France surges forward, breaking through the net.

More than ten million workers have been on strike for twelve days. The strike is expanding, and the French economy remains paralyzed. The French revisionists' true colors are exposed, and workers and students are rising up to denounce their treacherous actions. Many ordinary members within the French Communist Party are also rebelling.

New China News Agency, May 29th: Paris News: The political and economic strike of the French working class continues to surge forward like a mighty wave. On the 28th, large numbers of workers in important factories and enterprises announced strikes. The French ruling class is using the French revisionist group to disrupt the just struggle of workers and students. The French revisionists and the traitors they control, the French General Confederation of Labor, have exposed their ugly faces, and more and more progressive workers and students in France are spitting on them.

The nationwide strike of more than ten million workers in France has lasted twelve days. The French working class, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, has trampled the return-to-work "agreement" reached between the French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, and the monopolistic bourgeoisie, and is fighting with high spirits. The economic life of the entire country continues to be in a state of paralysis.

In recent days, more workers have joined the strike. The workers of the Pierre Latte gas diffusion plant, the center of France's atomic industry, which produces materials for France's atomic and hydrogen bombs, began an indefinite strike on the 29th. In Cadarache, near Marseille, the French Atomic Research Center has been occupied by 3,000 striking workers. France's atomic industry and atomic research institutions are in a state of paralysis.

The employees of the French News Agency held a general meeting on the 28th and decided to go on strike immediately. From the evening of the 28th, the French News Agency stopped sending news both domestically and internationally. Due to the strike by reporters and employees, French radio and television have basically stopped broadcasting.

On the 28th, bakers across France followed the example of Paris bakers and joined the general strike. More than 2,000 truck drivers also announced a strike on the same day and occupied the offices of the transportation companies.

In the face of the surging struggle of French workers and students, the French government is using political deception and violent suppression to try to extinguish the just struggle of the French people.

On the 28th, the French government announced a "University and Social Reform Bill," vaguely agreeing to "reform" the current education system. The French authorities also pushed out the Minister of Education, Perreffit, as a scapegoat, making him announce his "resignation." On the other hand, Prime Minister Pompidou publicly declared on the 28th that the French government "will no longer tolerate any disturbances and will take all necessary measures" to maintain "order." Currently, the French authorities are continuing to search in cities like Paris, Marseille, Lyon, and Nantes, where there are fierce clashes between the masses and the police. They are confiscating Molotov cocktails and other self-defense tools made by students and workers to counter the police's bloody suppression, and are arresting people on a large scale.

However, the progressive students and workers in France are neither deceived by sweet words nor frightened by the violence of the bourgeoisie. They say, "The issue of power is not a matter of one person (Perreffit) resigning," and workers and students want to carry out a revolution. Students in Paris also expressed that they will continue to take to the streets to protest, responding to counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence.

The French government, caught off guard by the rebellious actions of the revolutionary masses, is urgently instructing French revisionists and various traitors and strike-breakers to disrupt the struggle of French workers and students. On the 28th, Prime Minister Pompidou publicly urged the leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, and other yellow union leaders to "take the initiative and go to every enterprise" to demand that workers "respect the order of the Republic" and quickly return to work. Many leaders of the French revisionists and other yellow unions are currently engaged in frenzied activities in many important factories, mines, and enterprises, spreading the fallacies of "restraint" and "not exceeding certain limits," and trying to undermine the workers' fighting spirit and serve the French monopolistic bourgeoisie.

More and more French workers and students have seen through the shameful face of the French revisionist group betraying the revolutionary masses and are condemning the treacherous actions of the French revisionists. On the 27th, more than 20,000 Paris workers, disregarding the "orders" of the French revisionists and the French General Confederation of Labor they control, participated in the meeting held by students at the Charlety Stadium. Even many ordinary members and some cadres within the French Communist Party are rebelling against the French revisionists. They bravely took to the streets and fought side by side with young students and workers.

The revolutionary storm of the French people is becoming more and more fierce, shaking the reactionary rule of France and the entire Europe. The French "Le Monde" newspaper exclaimed that the workers' refusal to return to work has turned France "from a national crisis into a revolutionary situation." Fred Catherwood, a responsible person of the British National Economic Development Council, worried that the unprecedented serious crisis in France would affect the other five countries of the Western European Common Market and Britain, and would cause a "major collapse of world trade."

    复工“协议”踩脚下　法修工贼抛一边
    法国工人学生斗争怒潮冲决罗网滚滚向前
    一千多万工人大罢工已经坚持十二天。罢工行列不断扩大，法国全国经济继续陷于瘫痪法修工贼面目毕露，工人学生群起斥责叛徒行径，法修党内不少普通党员也奋起造反
    新华社二十九日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人阶级全国性的政治经济罢工的怒潮，继续以倒海翻江卷巨澜之势，汹涌澎湃地向前发展。二十八日又有大批重要工厂企业里的工人宣布罢工。法国统治集团加紧利用法国修正主义集团破坏工人与学生的正义斗争。法修及其控制的法国总工会叛徒、工贼的丑恶嘴脸更加暴露，被越来越多的法国进步工人和学生所唾弃。
    法国一千多万工人的全国大罢工，到二十九日已坚持了十二天。有着巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级，把法修控制的总工会同垄断资产阶级达成的复工“协议”踩在脚下，斗志昂扬地坚持斗争。法国全国的经济生活继续陷于瘫痪状态。
    连日来，继续有大批工人参加到罢工斗争的行列中来。法国原子工业的中心，为法国生产原子弹和氢弹原料的皮埃尔拉特气体扩散工厂的职工，二十九日开始举行无限期罢工。在马赛附近的卡达拉希的法国原子研究中心，已被罢工的三千职工所占领。法国的原子工业和原子研究机构已陷于瘫痪。
    法国新闻社的职工二十八日举行了全体大会，决定立即罢工。从二十八日晚起，法新社已停止向国内外发报。由于记者和职工的罢工，法国广播和电视台基本上已停止广播。
    法国全国的面包师二十八日也效法巴黎的面包工人，参加总罢工的行列。两千多公路运输工人同日也宣告罢工，并且占领了运输公司的办事处。
    在法国工人学生斗争的怒潮继续高涨的情况下，法国政府加紧使用政治欺骗和暴力镇压两手，妄图扑灭法国人民的正义斗争。
    法国政府二十八日公布了一个“大学和社会改革法案”，含糊其辞地答应“改革”现行的教育制度。法国当局还把教育部长佩雷菲特推出来作为替罪羊，让他宣告“辞职”。另一方面，法国总理蓬皮杜二十八日公开叫嚷，法国政府“不再容忍任何骚乱，将采取一切必要的措施”来维持“治安”。目前，法国当局继续在群众同警察进行激烈斗争的巴黎、马赛、里昂、南特等城市进行搜查，没收学生、工人为了反击警察血腥镇压而制造的燃烧瓶和其他自卫工具，并大肆抓人。
    可是，法国进步的学生和工人既不受甜言蜜语的欺骗，也不怕资产阶级暴力的恐吓。他们说，“政权的问题不是‘佩雷菲特’一个人（辞职）的问题”，工人与学生要的是进行一场革命。巴黎学生们还表示，他们要继续上街游行，以革命的暴力回答反革命的暴力。
    被革命群众的造反行动弄得狼狈不堪的法国政府，加紧指使法国修正主义分子和形形色色的叛徒、工贼破坏法国工人和学生的斗争。法国总理蓬皮杜二十八日就公开催促法修控制的总工会的头目和其他黄色工会头子，“采取主动，到每一个企业中”要工人“尊重共和国的秩序”，赶快复工。法修和其他黄色工会的许多头目，目前正在许多重要的厂矿企业中进行狂热的活动，散布工人要“克制”，要求不能超过“某种限度”等等谬论，极力瓦解工人的斗志，为法国垄断资产阶级效劳。
    越来越多的法国工人和学生识破了法国修正主义集团出卖革命群众的可耻面目，纷纷谴责法修的叛卖行径。二十七日，就有二万多巴黎工人不听法修和它控制的总工会的“号令”，参加了学生在夏勒蒂运动场上举行的大会。甚至法修党内许多普通党员和一些干部也纷纷起来造法修的反。他们勇敢地走上街头，同青年学生和工人并肩战斗。
    法国人民革命的风暴越来越猛烈地冲击着法国的反动统治，震撼着整个欧洲。法国《世界报》惊呼，工人拒绝复工使法国“从一场全国性危机转入一场革命形势”。英国全国经济发展委员会负责人弗雷德·卡瑟伍德担心法国空前严重的危机，将会影响西欧共同市场其他五个国家和英国，并将造成“世界贸易的重大瓦解”。
