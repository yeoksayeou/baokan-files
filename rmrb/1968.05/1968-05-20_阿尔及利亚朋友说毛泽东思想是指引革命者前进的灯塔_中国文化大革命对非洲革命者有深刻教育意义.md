Algerian friends enthusiastically acclaim the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

An old worker excitedly said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is wonderful! Seven hundred million Chinese people have all been mobilized, all are studying Chairman Mao's works, and all are criticizing China's Khrushchev and the capitalist road he advocates. This is an unprecedented great movement. This is a severe blow to the revisionist traitors."

The old worker continued, "Now, our hearts are with China, with Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's works are spreading throughout the world. The revolutionary situation in the world is getting better and better every day."

A worker named Buashe said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only a great event for the Chinese people but also a great event for the people of the world. From the lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, we can see that consolidating the proletarian dictatorship is more difficult than seizing power. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has shown the world's revolutionary people the correct path to consolidate the proletarian revolutionary dictatorship. This revolution has made hundreds of millions of Chinese laborers into fighters against the bourgeoisie and revisionism. Chairman Mao is a great Marxist-Leninist of our time, a great leader beloved by the people of the world."

An Algerian old soldier who had participated in the war against French imperialist aggression and persistently studied Chairman Mao's works said, "This great revolution led by Chairman Mao has profound educational significance for us African revolutionaries. It will undoubtedly have a profound influence on the African revolution." He said, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution inspires our struggle.

Another friend said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a beacon guiding revolutionaries forward. A socialist China tempered by the Cultural Revolution is our hope."

A student named Yousef said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has profound significance. It will undoubtedly have a great impact on the world."

    阿尔及利亚朋友说毛泽东思想是指引革命者前进的灯塔
    中国文化大革命对非洲革命者有深刻教育意义
    新华社阿尔及尔十八日电　阿尔及利亚朋友热烈欢呼由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的巨大成就。
    一位老工人兴奋地说：“中国文化大革命太好了！七亿中国人民都动员起来，都在学习毛主席著作，都批判中国的赫鲁晓夫和他所走的资本主义道路，这是前所未有的大运动。这是对修正主义叛徒的狠狠打击。”
    这位老工人接着说：“现在，我们的心向着中国，向着毛泽东。毛泽东的著作传播到全世界。世界的革命形势一天天好起来。”
    一位名叫布阿舍的工人说：“无产阶级文化大革命不仅是中国人民的大事，也是世界人民的大事。从在苏联复辟资本主义的教训中可以看出，巩固无产阶级政权比夺取政权更困难。通过中国文化大革命，毛主席给世界革命人民指出了巩固无产阶级革命政权的正确道路。这场革命使中国几亿劳动人民成为同资产阶级、修正主义进行斗争的战士。毛主席是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是世界人民热爱的伟大领袖。”
    一位坚持学习毛主席著作、当年参加过抗击法国帝国主义侵略战争的阿尔及利亚老战士说：“毛主席领导的这场伟大的革命对于我们非洲的革命者有着深刻的教育意义，它必将对非洲的革命产生深远的影响。”他说，中国文化大革命鼓舞着我们的斗争。
    另一位朋友说：“毛泽东思想是指引革命者前进的灯塔。经过文化大革命锻炼的社会主义中国，是我们心中的希望。”
    一位名叫尤塞夫的学生说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命具有深远的意义。它必将在全世界产生巨大的影响。”
