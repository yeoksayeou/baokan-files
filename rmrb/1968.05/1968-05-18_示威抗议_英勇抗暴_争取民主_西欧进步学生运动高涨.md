In France, students are bravely fighting, and progressive student movements in other Western European countries are also surging forward. In recent days, student struggles of varying scales have erupted in Spain, Italy, West Germany, and Britain.

In Spain, 800 students at the University of Madrid held a demonstration on the 16th to oppose the Franco dictatorship and protest the government's unreasonable ban on student gatherings. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Down with Franco" and "We want freedom of speech." When the Spanish reactionary authorities sent a large number of police armed with batons and water cannons, as well as mounted police, to suppress the demonstration, the students bravely fought back. They built barricades in the campus using benches, chairs, and cars to block the police's advance, and retaliated with stones, glass bottles, and small bombs made from empty bottles. The students' struggle received support from underground trade union organizations in Spain.

In Italy, following the occupation of lecture halls by hundreds of students at the University of Milan on the 15th to demand democratic rights, hundreds of students in Florence took to the streets on the 16th to hold a demonstration and engage in a struggle with the police.

In West Germany, medical students held demonstrations in many cities on the 14th to protest the lack of formal jobs after graduation or the delay in receiving salaries for three to four years after starting work. The demonstrations involved 3,000 students in Münster, 1,500 in Bonn, and 800 in Hamburg. The students announced that if the authorities do not change this situation, they will take "more drastic measures."

In Britain, over a thousand students at the University of Essex occupied the school buildings on the 14th, demanding that the school revoke the punishment of three students. These three students had recently been suspended for opposing the activities of "experts" from the government's chemical warfare research institute on campus.

    示威抗议  英勇抗暴  争取民主
    西欧进步学生运动高涨
    据新华社十七日讯　在法国学生英勇斗争的同时，其他西欧国家的进步学生运动也正在进一步高涨。连日来，在西班牙、意大利、西德和英国都相继爆发了规模不等的学生斗争。在西班牙，马德里大学的八百名学生十六日举行示威，反对佛朗哥独裁政权，抗议政府当局无理禁止学生集会。示威者高呼“不要佛朗哥”，“我们要言论自由”等口号。当西班牙反动当局派出大批拿着警棍和水龙的警察和骑警前来镇压时，学生们勇敢地进行了自卫反击。他们在校园内用板凳、椅子和汽车等筑起了障碍物，阻止警察前进，并且用石块、玻璃瓶和用空瓶制造的小型炸弹向警察还击。学生的斗争，得到了西班牙地下工会组织的支持。
    在意大利，继米兰大学的数百名学生十五日占领了学校的讲堂，展开要求民主权利的斗争之后，十六日，佛罗伦萨的数百名学生又走上街头，举行示威，并同警察进行了搏斗。
    在西德，医科大学的学生十四日在许多城市举行示威游行，抗议他们毕业后找不到正式工作，或者要在工作后三、四年才能拿到工资。示威学生在明斯特有三千人，在波恩有一千五百人，在汉堡有八百人。学生们宣布，如果当局不改变这种情况，他们将采取“更强硬的措施”。
    在英国，艾塞克斯大学的一千多名学生十四日占领了学校的大楼，坚决要求校方撤销对三名学生的处分。这三名学生，最近因为反对政府化学战研究所的“专家”去该校活动而被无理停止学籍。（附图片）
