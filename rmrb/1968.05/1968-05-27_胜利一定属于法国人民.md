At the moment when the vast number of proletarian revolutionaries in our country, filled with revolutionary fervor, are raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a thunderous roar has come from the heart of the capitalist world. The workers and students of France, as well as Europe and North America, have roared in rebellion against the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie!

The news of this joyous event has filled us, the Red Guards of the Hefei region who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, with boundless enthusiasm. We express our most resolute support for the revolutionary struggle of the French workers and students. We also express our most resolute support for the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in Europe and North America, and for the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Today, the just struggle of the French workers and students shows the awakening of the French people and the growing strength of the revolutionary forces in France. The new storm of the French people's revolutionary struggle has dealt a powerful blow to imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries. It has given great encouragement and support to the vast revolutionary masses in our country who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to the revolutionary people of the world.

Today, the workers' and students' movements that have risen in France, Europe, and North America are the inevitable result of the development of contradictions within the entire capitalist system. They are the red signal flares indicating that a powerful revolutionary storm is about to sweep across the entire capitalist world. We are eagerly following the developments of the struggles of the workers and students in France and in the various countries of Europe and North America.

The wheels of history are rolling forward along the path indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao. "It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the complete liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off."

However, the enemy will not disappear on its own. The ruling class in France is brutally suppressing the workers' and students' movements. The modern revisionists and all kinds of scabs and traitors have revealed their shameful faces. The modern revisionists and scabs and traitors are acting as accomplices, using every possible means to create trouble, deceive, and sabotage, plotting to extinguish the flames of this struggle. We are glad to see that the French working class and revolutionary students have set aside the leaders of the French revisionists and other yellow unions, and are fighting bravely with a combative attitude.

Fight on, brave French working class and revolutionary students! Although the road of revolution is fraught with difficulties and twists and turns, we firmly believe that ultimate victory will surely belong to the French people. In the days to come, no matter what storms and waves may arise, we will stand by your side, fight with you, and achieve victory with you!

    胜利一定属于法国人民
    安徽省合肥地区大中学校红代会
    正当我国广大无产阶级革命派满怀革命激情，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，从资本主义世界心脏地区又传来了一声春雷。法国以及欧洲、北美的工人和学生为反抗垄断资产阶级的反动统治而怒吼了！
    喜讯传来，我们无限忠于毛主席的合肥地区广大红卫兵小将，无不欢欣鼓舞。我们对于正在进行英勇斗争的法国工人和学生的革命斗争，表示最坚决的支持。我们对于欧洲、北美各国工人和学生的革命斗争，对于全世界一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命斗争，表示最坚决的支持。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”今天法国工人和学生的正义斗争，表明了法国人民的觉醒，显示了法国的革命力量的壮大。法国人民革命斗争的新风暴，有力地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，给了正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的我国广大革命群众和全世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞和支持。
    今天，在法国和欧洲、北美兴起的工人运动和学生运动，是整个资本主义制度内部矛盾发展的必然结果，是整个资本主义世界将要刮起强大革命风暴的红色信号弹。我们正以兴奋的心情，关注着法国以及欧洲、北美各国工人和学生斗争的发展。
    历史的车轮正沿着我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指引的方向滚滚向前。“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    但是，敌人是不会自行消灭的。法国统治集团残暴镇压法国的工人和学生运动；现代修正主义者以及形形色色的工贼、叛徒，都露出了可耻的面目。现代修正主义者和工贼、叛徒们为虎作伥，千方百计地进行捣乱、欺骗和破坏，阴谋扑灭这场斗争的烈火。我们高兴地看到，法国工人阶级和革命学生，把法修和其他黄色工会的头目撇在一边，以战斗的姿态，英勇地战斗。
    战斗吧，英勇的法国工人阶级和革命学生！尽管革命的道路是艰难曲折的，但是，我们坚信，最后胜利一定是属于法国人民的。在未来的日子里，不管出现什么样的惊涛骇浪，我们都将站在你们一边，永远和你们战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
