Our country's production of ordinary low-alloy steel has reached a new level. The number of varieties of this type of steel has increased by more than 70% compared to the beginning of 1966, production has increased twentyfold, and the quality is excellent.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, in the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the steelworkers of our country have hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and daring to think and do, smashed the foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas, and developed the varieties, quality, and production of ordinary low-alloy steel, which marks the self-reliant development path of our country's steel industry, to a new level. The number of varieties of this type of steel has increased by more than 70% compared to the beginning of 1966, and production has increased twentyfold. This great achievement in the steel industry is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent years, products made from ordinary low-alloy steel in our country have been widely used in many departments such as railways, transportation, machinery, chemical industry, petroleum, and construction. The Liberation brand trucks made from ordinary low-alloy steel have a load-to-weight ratio that has surpassed the world's advanced level. The large-scale synthetic ammonia equipment, after design reforms, has reduced the total weight by about two-thirds compared to the original. The use of ordinary low-alloy steel to manufacture ten-thousand-ton ships, high-pressure containers, locomotive vehicles, large-scale bridge steel, and railway sleepers has been praised by the using departments for their excellent quality.

Our country's research, trial production, and development of ordinary low-alloy steel have been a full decade since it began. However, it was only in the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that it was truly valued and developed. This reflects the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two paths in the field of science and technology.

For more than a hundred years, the steel production of the major capitalist countries in the world has been more than 90% carbon steel, with a very small proportion of alloy steel. This situation has continued for more than a hundred years and is considered an unchangeable law. However, the revolutionary workers of our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, believe that this is just a foreign framework and foreign dogma. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always advocated self-reliance. Chairman Mao also wisely proposed to break the foreign frameworks and follow our own path of industrial development. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and their agents in the metallurgical industry have stubbornly adhered to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, allowing steel plants to produce only according to foreign frameworks for a long time, and crazily suppressing the revolutionary creative spirit of steelworkers. After 1958, the revolutionary workers of steel plants in Anshan, Shanghai, and other places successively smelted several new types of alloy steel, which were welcomed by the using departments. However, due to the sabotage of a handful of capitalist-roaders, by the end of 1965, the varieties of ordinary low-alloy steel had only developed a few, and the production accounted for only about 1% of the total steel production. At the end of 1965, steelworkers responded to Chairman Mao's call for a design revolution, considering that products must first undergo a revolution for materials, and decided to continue to vigorously promote the trial production of ordinary low-alloy steel. However, they still encountered various difficulties and obstacles from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the metallurgical industry, making this work progress very slowly.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was like a spring thunder. The broad masses of steelworkers studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They overthrew the capitalist-roaders, criticized the revisionist construction line implemented by the capitalist-roaders and some bourgeois academic authorities and "experts," eliminated the slave mentality and crawling mentality, and self-reliantly vigorously promoted the trial production of new varieties of ordinary low-alloy steel. Many large and small steel plants and related schools and scientific research institutions actively participated in this work, quickly forming a mass movement. The workers of Shanghai Third Steel Plant took the trial production and production of ordinary low-alloy steel as a revolutionary action to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and as a revolutionary action against imperialism and revisionism. In just two years, they successfully trial-produced and put into mass production eight varieties of ordinary low-alloy steel, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total production. There is a steel plant where the ore contains an alloy element, and the steel often has surface defects. For a long time, this problem could not be solved. In the past two years, the broad revolutionary masses, through the study of Mao Zedong Thought, have carried out a large number of experimental research work. They implemented a three-in-one combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, and vigorously promoted the mass movement, finally turning the unfavorable factors into favorable factors, significantly improving the performance of the steel, especially the corrosion resistance of the steel. This plant has successively successfully smelted more than ten new varieties of ordinary low-alloy steel, five of which have been formally produced and used, becoming the most welcome new steel varieties for the railway and transportation departments.

### 高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  走自力更生发展工业的道路　我国普通低合金钢生产达到新水平　这类钢的品种比一九六六年初增加百分之七十以上，产量提高二十倍，质量良好

　　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  走自力更生发展工业的道路
　　我国普通低合金钢生产达到新水平
　　这类钢的品种比一九六六年初增加百分之七十以上，产量提高二十倍，质量良好
    据新华社三十日讯　我国钢铁工人在开展无产阶级文化大革命的近两年中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生、敢想敢干的无产阶级革命精神，大破洋框框，洋教条，把标志着我国钢铁工业自力更生发展道路的普通低合金钢的品种、质量和产量，发展到了一个新的水平，使这类钢的品种比一九六六年初增加百分之七十以上，产量提高二十倍。钢铁工业的这一巨大成就，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    近年来，我国利用普通低合金钢材料制造的产品，已经遍及铁道、交通、机械、化工、石油及建筑等许多部门，采用普通低合金钢材制成的解放牌汽车，载重与自重系数已经超过世界先进水平；制造的大型合成氨设备，经设计改革后，总重量比原来减轻约三分之二。用普通低合金钢材制造的万吨巨轮、高压容器、机车车辆、大型桥梁钢材、铁路轨枕等，使用部门都反映质量良好。
    我国研究试制和发展普通低合金钢从开始到现在已经整十年了。可是，真正得到重视和发展是在开展无产阶级文化大革命的最近两年间。这中间，反映了科学技术领域中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。
    一百多年来，世界上主要的资本主义国家的钢产量，百分之九十以上是碳素钢，合金钢的比重很小。这种情况延续了一百多年，被认为是不可改变的规律。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国革命职工，认为这不过是一种洋框框、洋教条。我们的伟大领袖毛主席一向教导说：“我们是主张自力更生的。”毛主席还英明地提出要打破洋框框，走自己工业发展的道路。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在冶金工业部门的代理人，顽固地坚持反革命修正主义路线，长期来只许钢铁工厂按照洋框框进行生产，疯狂扼杀钢铁工人的革命创造精神。一九五八年后，鞍山、上海等地钢铁厂的革命职工，曾经陆续炼出了一些新合金钢种，受到使用部门的欢迎。可是，由于一小撮走资派的破坏，到一九六五年底，普通低合金钢的钢种只发展了几种，产量只占钢总产量的百分之一左右。一九六五年底，钢铁职工响应毛主席关于设计革命的伟大号召，考虑到产品要革命必须材料首先进行革命，决心继续大搞普通低合金钢的试验，仍遭到冶金工业部党内一小撮走资派的种种刁难和阻挠，因此使这项工作进展很缓慢。
    无产阶级文化大革命好似一声春雷，钢铁工业广大职工活学活用毛泽东思想，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们斗倒了走资派，批判了走资派和一些资产阶级反动学术权威、“专家”所执行的修正主义建设路线，清除洋奴思想和爬行主义，自力更生地放手大搞普通低合金新钢种的试验。许许多多大小钢厂和有关学校、科学研究单位都积极投入这项工作，很快形成了群众运动。上海第三钢铁厂职工把试验和生产普通低合金钢当作捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命行动，当作反帝反修的革命行动，在短短两年内就试炼成功并大批投入生产了八种普通低合金钢，产量超过总产量五分之一。有一个钢铁厂，因为矿石中含有一种合金元素，炼出的钢往往出现表面缺陷，长期得不到解决。近两年来，广大革命职工通过学习毛泽东思想，进行了大量的试验研究工作。他们实行以工人为主体的领导干部、技术人员的三结合，大搞群众运动，终于把不利因素转化为有利因素，明显地提高了钢的性能，特别是提高了钢的耐腐蚀性能。这个厂先后共冶炼成功十多种普通低合金钢新品种，其中五种已经正式生产使用，成为最受铁路、交通部门欢迎的新钢种。
