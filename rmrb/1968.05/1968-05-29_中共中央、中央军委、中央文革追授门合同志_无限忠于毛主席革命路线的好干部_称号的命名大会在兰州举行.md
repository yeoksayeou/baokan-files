In the great struggle to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 28th: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously confer the title of "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" on Comrade Men He, a deputy political instructor of the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Regiment of a certain unit in the Qinghai Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. A grand conference was recently held in Lanzhou to confer this title. All attendees resolved to learn from Comrade Men He's lofty virtues of unwavering loyalty to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to create new achievements in the great struggle to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Attendees of the conference included responsible comrades from the Lanzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, responsible comrades from the military regions and revolutionary committees of Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces, all representatives of the Third Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Chairman Mao's Thoughts in the Lanzhou Military Region, representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, representatives from Comrade Men He's former unit, and Comrade Men He's father Men Jinzhong and wife Zhang Fengying, among others.

The central part of the conference stage was adorned with a large portrait of Chairman Mao, and on both sides hung large banners reading: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" On both sides of the venue, large banners displayed Comrade Men He's lifelong vow: "Think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao."

The conference began with the majestic song "The East is Red." All attendees, with hearts full of boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly toasted "Long live Chairman Mao!" Everyone held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!"

At the conference, Suo Henghan, Political Commissar of the Lanzhou Military Region, read the order from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, posthumously conferring the title of "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" on Comrade Men He. At this moment, the audience waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Zhang Dazhi, Commander of the Lanzhou Military Region, spoke at the conference. He said, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously confer the title of "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" on Comrade Men He. This is Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's greatest concern, greatest education, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for our army. It is the greatest honor for all officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou Military Region.

Comrade Zhang Dazhi said, Comrade Men He, for twenty years, has been unwaveringly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, unwaveringly loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In every major class struggle, he stood most consciously, most resolutely, and most bravely on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He fought fearlessly against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and all class enemies, effectively resisting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promoted, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Men He actively responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the broad masses of the left," firmly supporting the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai, resisting the counter-revolutionary tide, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," Comrade Men He remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production," and together with the revolutionary masses of the Baqiang Farm, installed anti-cloud and anti-hail soil rockets. He voluntarily took on the most dangerous work, and in the face of an unexpected explosion of explosives, he fearlessly pounced on the explosives, saving twenty-seven class brothers with his life. Comrade Men He's lofty communist spirit and fearless revolutionary heroism fully demonstrated the finest qualities of our army: unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, unwavering loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and unwavering loyalty to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. He is truly a great model of the new era of Mao Zedong Thought, a fine representative of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a good son of the Party and the people, a great vanguard warrior of communism, and a good cadre loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Zhang Dazhi called on all officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou Military Region to seriously learn from Comrade Men He's lofty virtues of unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Like Comrade Men He, truly achieve "think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao," "always guard Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand guard, charge forward, and fight well," "live to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and die to dedicate oneself to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Like Comrade Men He, truly achieve "all my words, all my actions, and all my work in life are for the liberation of the people; every moment, every second, and every bit of my life is dedicated to working for the people's interests," never forget class bitterness, carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard work and simplicity, maintain the character of an ordinary laborer and an ordinary soldier, never leave the masses, and be heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. Like Comrade Men He, maintain the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, with a deep proletarian affection for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, explode a revolution in the depths of the soul, let the "public" occupy one's ideological position, and become a vanguard warrior who consciously carries out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Zhang Dazhi pointed out, Comrade Men He is a shining example personally set for us by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. We must vigorously launch a campaign to learn from Comrade Men He and push the great mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, never forget class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and actively and unceasingly launch attacks on class enemies. We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, thoroughly smash the rightist wind of reversal, further do a good job in "three supports and two militaries," deeply carry out "support the army and love the people" activities, strengthen military-civilian relations, advance victoriously, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Zhang Jianglin, Deputy Commander of the Qinghai Military Region and Deputy Chairman of the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee, Qiu Yumin, Deputy Chairman of the Gansu Revolutionary Committee, and representatives from the military regions and stationed troops of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia successively spoke at the conference. Liu Xuebao, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a heroic soldier, spoke on behalf of all representatives of the Third Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the Lanzhou Military Region, expressing the determination to seriously learn from Comrade Men He's shining deeds, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, better complete the "three supports and two militaries" tasks entrusted by the great leader Chairman Mao, and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives of the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province, representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction of Gansu Province, and representatives of the twenty-seven revolutionary masses saved by Comrade Men He successively spoke at the conference. The representative of the saved revolutionary masses said excitedly, The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group posthumously conferred the title of "Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" on Comrade Men He, fully expressing our wishes. Comrade Men He's great image will forever live in our hearts. We must learn from Comrade Men He and, like Comrade Men He, diligently learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and strive for a lifetime to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Men He's wife, Zhang Fengying, spoke amid enthusiastic applause. She said, Men He grew from an ordinary peasant to a good cadre loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is entirely the result of Chairman Mao's teachings and the result of being trained by the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, people all over the country are learning from him. As his family member, I must actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, better learn from Comrade Men He, and like him, diligently learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism, step by step follow Chairman Mao, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. At the same time, I must also educate my children to be like their father, unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry on the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The battalion commander of the unit where Comrade Men He served, Li Guanghe, spoke on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the battalion. He said, Comrade Men He was a good instructor when he was alive and is still a good instructor after his martyrdom. In the battle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Comrade Men He will forever be our leader. With tears, we will inherit the heroic will and turn it into a grand blueprint. We must enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, deeply carry out activities to learn from Comrade Men He. We firmly guarantee to, like Comrade Men He, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously highlight proletarian politics, most loyally execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

At the conference, the decision of the Lanzhou Military Region Party Committee on implementing the order of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group and further widely and deeply carrying out activities to learn from Comrade Men He was read. Congratulatory telegrams from many units and revolutionary committees of provinces, cities, and revolutionary mass organizations were also read. Revolutionary masses from the Lanzhou Region Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, and Red Guards of colleges and universities also came to the conference to extend warm congratulations.
