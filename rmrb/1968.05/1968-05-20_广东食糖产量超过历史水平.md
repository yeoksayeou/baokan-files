The revolutionary workers of the sugar industry system in Guangdong Province have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have firmly grasped class struggle, used revolution to lead production, and achieved double victories in both revolution and production. The sugar production and quality for the 1967-1968 sugarcane crushing season have both exceeded the highest levels in Guangdong's history. The total production has increased by more than 17 percent compared to the previous season.
