After arriving in the young People's Republic of South Yemen, our deepest impression was of the people's profound love and respect for Chairman Mao.

Not long after we arrived in Aden, one day we went to the post office to mail a letter. We saw two large red posters at the entrance, with two quotations from Chairman Mao written in Arabic: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "Revolutionary war is war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them."

Upon entering the post office, we saw another quotation on the wall: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary."

	Chairman Mao's Prestige and the Brilliance of His Thoughts

Some people said that these quotations from Chairman Mao were posted by underground workers before South Yemen's independence; others said that they were posted by guerrilla fighters after overthrowing British imperialist colonial rule. This incident reflected the great prestige of Chairman Mao in the hearts of the South Yemeni people and the deep influence of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the streets of Aden, many Arab South Yemenis would shout "Mao Zedong!" and "China!" upon seeing us, expressing their boundless respect for Chairman Mao and their friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. A guerrilla fighter standing guard at the entrance of the headquarters of the South Yemen National Liberation Front would immediately give a thumbs up and praise Chairman Mao as a great figure when the name of Chairman Mao was mentioned. When we went out, we often encountered many young students surrounding us, asking for "Quotations from Chairman Mao" or Mao badges. Some students even shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" One youth, after obtaining a long-desired copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," immediately opened the book. When he saw Chairman Mao's portrait, he held it with both hands and kissed it repeatedly.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the Guiding Light for Revolutionary People

We saw some young people sitting on wooden benches on the street, or inside shops, deeply engrossed in reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They told us that most of them had obtained the book from progressive friends before independence, and many had written to Chinese friends in the Yemen Arab Republic to request copies. Two major bookstores in Aden, after independence, sold Chairman Mao's works for the first time and were enthusiastically received by readers. Books such as "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong," "Why Can the Red Political Power Exist in China?" "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" were almost all sold out. The youths said: Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for our continuous progress.

	Long Live Chairman Mao!

In March, on the afternoon of a local folk festival, we were accompanied by a friend from the Department of Culture and National Guidance to visit Sheikh Osman's festival activities. As soon as we arrived, we were surrounded by a crowd. A middle school student named Monsour told us that on the day of South Yemen's independence, he took out a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" hidden at home, held up this red treasure book, and participated in the grand parade celebrating independence. He also shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with British imperialism!" He said, "We love Chairman Mao because he is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world." Several of his classmates standing nearby also expressed their ardent feelings of admiration for Chairman Mao.

One day, we left Aden and went to the vicinity of Lahij to the "Martyrs' Village," where we met several guerrilla fighters who had fought against the British colonial forces. They enthusiastically chatted with us. Soon, a guerrilla fighter rushed into a room and quickly came out, holding a colored portrait of Chairman Mao. They said that this portrait of Chairman Mao was cut from a magazine because they knew that Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world. They also made a fine frame for the portrait of Chairman Mao. Whenever they celebrated, they would hold up the portrait of Chairman Mao to express their joy.

	Thank Chairman Mao for Sending Good Doctors

We once encountered a young man at a gas station by the sea. As soon as he saw us, he greeted us warmly as if we were family. It turned out that before South Yemen's independence, he once fell ill and had no money for treatment. His friends told him to go to the Yemen Arab Republic to find doctors from the Chinese medical team for treatment. Thus, he went to Ib in the Yemen Arab Republic and found the Chinese medical team. The Chinese doctors immediately treated him, and he recovered after taking medicine for a few days. This incident moved him deeply, and he thanked Chairman Mao for sending Chinese doctors to cure his illness. He said that he also obtained a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Arabic from the Chinese doctors. Although his education level was not high, he persisted in studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Many leaders of the South Yemen National Liberation Front hold Chairman Mao in high esteem. During the war years, the National Liberation Front widely distributed Chairman Mao's works such as "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" to guerrilla fighters for study. A leader of the National Liberation Front said that the South Yemeni people used Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to fight against imperialism and achieved victory. He also said, "The Chinese revolutionary experience is most suitable for our country. We have drawn rich experience from Chairman Mao's works."

### 南也门人民敬爱毛主席

专栏：南也门通讯

　　南也门人民敬爱毛主席
    我们到年青的南也门人民共和国以后，印象最深的是这个国家的人民群众对毛主席非常热爱、非常尊敬。
    我们刚到亚丁不久，有一天到邮政总局去寄信，看见邮局大门口贴着两张大红纸，上面用阿拉伯文写着两条毛主席语录：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    走进邮局大门，里面墙上张贴着：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”
　　崇高的威望　光辉的思想
    有人说，这些毛主席语录是南也门独立前地下工作者贴的；有人说，这是游击队员在推翻了英帝国主义殖民统治后张贴的。这件事情反映了伟大领袖毛主席在南也门人民心中的崇高威望和光辉的毛泽东思想的深入人心。
    在亚丁街上，很多南也门的阿拉伯人见了我们就喊：“毛泽东！”“中国！”表示他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬意和对中国人民的友好感情。在南也门民族解放阵线总部门口站岗的一位游击队员，一提起毛主席，就伸出大拇指，赞扬毛主席是了不起的伟大人物。我们上街，常常遇到很多青年学生围着我们要《毛主席语录》或毛主席像章。有的学生还高呼“毛主席万岁！”有一个青年得到了一本渴望已久的《毛主席语录》后，马上打开语录本，当他见到毛主席像时，就双手捧着吻了又吻。
　　毛泽东思想是指导革命人民前进的明灯
    我们见到有的青年坐在街头的木凳上，在商店的柜台里，埋头阅读《毛主席语录》。他们告诉我们，他们大多是在独立前就从进步朋友那里辗转得到的，也有很多人是在独立后直接写信给在阿拉伯也门共和国的中国朋友，请中国朋友给他们邮寄来的。亚丁的两家主要书店独立后第一次出售毛主席的著作，就受到了广大读者的热烈欢迎。《毛泽东军事文选》和《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》、《抗日游击战争的战略问题》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《论人民民主专政》等毛主席著作单行本，几乎都被读者购买一空。青年们说：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是指导我们不断前进的明灯。
　　高呼：毛泽东主席万岁！
    三月间，一个当地民间节日的下午，我们由文化和国家指导部的一位朋友陪同到谢赫·奥斯曼参观节日活动。我们一到那里就被一群人围住了。一个名叫蒙苏尔的中学生对我们说，南也门独立那天，他拿出藏在家中的《毛主席语录》，高举着这本红色宝书，参加了庆祝独立的盛大游行。他还高呼“毛泽东主席万岁！”“打倒英国殖民主义！”等口号。他说：“我们热爱毛主席，因为他是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”站在一旁的他的几位同学也纷纷向我们表达了南也门青年爱戴毛主席的热烈心情。
    一天，我们从亚丁出发到了拉赫杰附近的“烈士村”的地方，在那里遇到了几位曾经同英国殖民军作过斗争的游击队员。他们很热情地同我们交谈起来。不一会儿，一位游击队员急匆匆地跑进一间屋子里去，又急匆匆地跑了出来，手里拿着一张毛主席的彩色画像。他们说，这幅毛主席像是从画报上剪裁下来的，因为他们知道毛主席是中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖，他们又为这幅毛主席像配了一个精制的镜框，每当欢庆的时候，他们就高举毛主席像表示庆贺。
　　感谢毛主席派出的好医生
    我们曾在海边的一个加油站遇见一个青年，他一见我们就象见了亲人一般，亲热地和我们攀谈起来。原来，还在南也门独立以前，有一次他生了病，没钱医治。亲友们告诉他到阿拉伯也门共和国去，找中国医疗队的医生治疗。于是他到了阿拉伯也门共和国的伊卜，找到了中国医疗队。中国医生立即为他治病，他吃药不几天病就好了。这件事使他非常感动，他感谢毛主席派出的中国医生给他治好了病。他说，他还从中国医生那里要到了一本阿拉伯文的《毛主席语录》。他虽然文化程度不高，但是一直在坚持学习《毛主席语录》。
    南也门民族解放阵线的许多负责人十分崇敬毛主席。在战争年代里，民族解放阵线曾经把毛主席的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》等著作广泛印发给游击队员们学习。一位民族解放阵线的负责人说，南也门人民就是用毛泽东思想作为指导，进行反对帝国主义的斗争，并获得了胜利。他还说：“中国革命经验最适合我国情况，我们从毛主席著作中吸取了中国革命的丰富经验。”
