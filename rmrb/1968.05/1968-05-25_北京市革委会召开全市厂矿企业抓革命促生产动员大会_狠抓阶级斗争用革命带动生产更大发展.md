The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a full-city factory and mine enterprise conference to promote revolution and production on May 22. The conference called on the city's working class to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to advance victoriously, to grasp class struggle, to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to continue to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, to use revolution to drive production to greater development, and to achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The current revolutionary and production situation in the capital's industrial and transportation sectors is excellent and getting better, which is the result of firmly grasping class struggle. Under the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary masses have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism against the enemies of the proletariat. The revolutionary criticism has effectively promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, greatly advancing the revolutionization of people's thinking. With the development of the revolutionary situation, the city's industrial production has steadily increased in March and April this year, and continued to grow in the first half of May. Many enterprises have also made remarkable achievements in saving resources for the revolution and carrying out mass technical innovation and technological revolution.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The conference called on the city's revolutionary workers to vigorously carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to vigorously organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and to direct everything. The working class of the capital is closest to Chairman Mao and should follow Chairman Mao the most closely. They should take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and vow to be models in learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The conference called on the broad revolutionary workers of the city to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to firmly grasp class struggle, to firmly grasp the revolutionary criticism, to purify and consolidate the proletarian class ranks, and to launch a sustained and fierce attack on the handful of top capitalist roaders within the party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, as well as their agents in factories and mines. They should be criticized and denounced politically, ideologically, and theoretically. The handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists should be exposed and fought against. In the struggle, the two types of different contradictions should be strictly distinguished. The thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat should be carried forward, and right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism should be resolutely opposed. The rightist reversal wind should be thoroughly smashed, and the bourgeois reactionary thoughts of being "left" in form but right in essence should be opposed. The various sabotage activities of the class enemies should be exposed and smashed in time.

The conference pointed out that in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," revolution must be used to promote the development of production. The experience of many advanced units has proven that where the revolution is well grasped, production will rise. If the revolution is not well grasped, it will inevitably affect production. The conference emphasized the need to resolutely oppose anarchism. The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is an advanced class and should dare to fight against bourgeois ideology. It is necessary to strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, consciously observe socialist labor discipline, improve attendance rates and work time utilization rates. Fully mobilize the role of veteran workers in grasping revolution and promoting production, while also mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of young workers, and promote unity between old and new workers. Those who incite anarchism and sabotage revolution and production must be exposed and fought against.

The conference called on the revolutionary workers of all factories and mines in the city to better implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "save resources for the revolution," to vigorously carry out the production and savings movement, to exhaust all potential, to be self-reliant, to strive for progress, to produce and save a large amount of coal and other materials, to save raw materials, manpower, and resources, to pay attention to the recovery and utilization of waste materials, and to save and substitute. The spirit of communism should be carried forward, and production cooperation should be done well.

The conference called on all revolutionary committees and military control committees of factories and mines in the city to strengthen the leadership of grasping revolution and promoting production. Each leader should go deep into reality, persist in participating in labor, maintain close ties with the masses, and build the revolutionary committee into a strong command center that has proletarian revolutionary authority, can lead the broad revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies, and can lead production well.

The conference called on the revolutionary workers of the city to humbly learn from all advanced regions, advanced units, and advanced comrades, and strive to develop the good situation.

This mobilization conference was also an experience-sharing conference. Representatives of the revolutionary committees of Beijing Knitting General Factory, Beijing Mining Bureau Mucity Coal Mine, Beijing People's Machinery Factory, and Beijing Third Textile Mill shared their experiences and insights on how to grasp class struggle and firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The responsible persons of the revolutionary committees and military control committees of various factories and mines, and the representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions of workers who attended the meeting, were filled with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted revolutionary slogans, resolutely declaring: They will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more closely, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, remain humble and steadfast, advance victoriously, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieve new victories in revolution and production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    新华社二十四日讯　北京市革命委员会二十二日召开全市厂矿企业抓革命促生产动员大会，号召全市工人阶级更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，继续主动地向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，用革命带动生产的更大发展，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”当前首都工业交通战线革命和生产形势大好，越来越好，正是狠抓阶级斗争的结果。广大革命职工在支左人民解放军的热情帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，主动地向无产阶级的敌人猛烈进攻，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。革命的大批判有力地促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，大大推动了人的思想革命化。随着革命大好形势的发展，今年三、四月份全市工业生产稳步上升，五月上半月又持续增长。许多企业在节约闹革命和开展群众性技术革新、技术革命方面也作出了显著成绩。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。大会号召全市革命职工大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅我们的一切，指导我们的一切。首都工人阶级离毛主席最近，要跟毛主席最紧。要首先带头活学活用毛泽东思想，带头紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓作学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”会议号召全市广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓革命的大批判，纯洁和巩固无产阶级的阶级队伍，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派和彭真反革命修正主义集团以及他们在工矿企业的代理人展开持续不断的猛烈进攻，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭。要把一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子挖出来，斗倒斗臭。在斗争中要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。要发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风，反对形“左”实右的资产阶级反动思想，及时揭穿和粉碎阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏活动。
    会议指出，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，一定要以革命来促进生产的发展。许多先进单位的经验证明，凡是革命抓得好，生产就上去了。革命抓不好，就必然影响生产。会议强调要坚决反对无政府主义。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级是先进阶级，要敢于向资产阶级思想作斗争。要加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，自觉地遵守社会主义的劳动纪律，提高出勤率和工时利用率。充分发挥老工人在抓革命、促生产中的作用，同时发挥青年工人的革命积极性，搞好新老工人的团结。对于那些煽动无政府主义、破坏革命和生产的坏人，一定要把他们挖出来，斗倒斗臭。
    会议号召全市厂矿企业革命职工要更好地贯彻执行毛主席关于“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，大力开展增产节约运动，千方百计挖掘潜力，自力更生，奋发图强，增产节约大量煤炭和其他物资，节约原材料，节约人力物力，注意加强废旧物资的回收利用和节约代用的工作。要发扬共产主义精神，搞好生产协作。
    会议号召全市厂矿企业各革命委员会和军管会要加强对抓革命、促生产的领导工作，每个领导成员都要深入实际，坚持参加劳动，密切联系群众，把革命委员会建设成为有无产阶级革命权威的、能够率领广大革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗，又能领导好生产的坚强指挥部。
    大会号召全市革命职工，虚心地向一切先进地区、先进单位和先进同志学习，努力发展大好形势。
    这次动员大会，又是一次经验交流大会。北京针织总厂、北京矿务局木城涧煤矿、北京人民机器厂、北京第三棉纺织厂等单位的革命委员会代表，分别在大会上介绍了他们以阶级斗争为纲，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的经验体会。
    参加会议的各厂矿企业革命委员会负责人、军管会负责人和无产阶级革命派的工人代表们，满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，一次又一次地振臂高呼革命口号，坚决表示：一定要更加紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取革命和生产的新胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
