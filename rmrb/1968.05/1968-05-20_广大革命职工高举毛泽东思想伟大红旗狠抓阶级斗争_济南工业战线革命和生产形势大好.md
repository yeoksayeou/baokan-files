Revolutionary workers in Jinan's industrial sector, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are intensifying class struggle and deeply engaging in revolutionary criticism. They are proactively attacking class enemies, uncovering a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within enterprises, and implementing dictatorship over them. The revolution has driven the development of production, with the total industrial output value increasing month by month in the first four months of this year.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 17th, the revolutionary workers in Jinan's industrial sector, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have further expanded and deepened the revolutionary criticism this year. Revolutionary workers have closely linked the class struggle in their units, fiercely exposing and criticizing the revisionist black goods such as "material incentives," "profit-first," and "production first" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various enterprises. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Most grassroots units have established revolutionary committees.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses of the people. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions have further armed the minds of revolutionary workers. They deeply understand that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads will be. A handful of class enemies will not willingly accept their defeat; they will still struggle desperately. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses stand firmly at the forefront of the class struggle, launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. They have uncovered a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the enterprises, thoroughly exposed and criticized them, implemented proletarian dictatorship, and smashed the various plots and tricks of the class enemies who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production. This has mobilized the production enthusiasm of revolutionary workers and greatly promoted the development of the revolution and production. The Second Machine Tool Factory in Jinan, which had long failed to achieve revolutionary unity due to the instigation and sabotage by a handful of class enemies, has now rapidly achieved revolutionary unity and seen a straight-line increase in production after the revolutionary workers in the entire factory studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, opened their eyes, and rooted out the class enemies. The production plans for March and April were both overfulfilled.

The revolutionary workers in Jinan's industrial sector have directed the revolutionary spirit and boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the production struggle and scientific experiments. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, after more than 100 experiments, solved a problem that bourgeois technical "authorities" deemed impossible to solve. They built a modern pelletizing shaft furnace, increasing the pig iron output by 50% and saving more than 40,000 tons of coke and coal annually. The technical revolution and technical innovation activities in many factories and enterprises are also very active. New designs, new technologies, new products, new equipment, and new tools are constantly emerging. The production and quality of many important products have steadily improved. For example, the production of chemical fertilizers, agricultural bearings, steel ropes, caustic soda, boilers, transformers, machine-made paper, soap, glycerin, alcohol, rubber shoes, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth has all increased compared to the same period last year.

    广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗狠抓阶级斗争
    济南工业战线革命和生产形势大好
    主动向阶级敌人进攻，挖出了隐藏在企业内部一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，对他们实行专政。革命推动了生产的发展，今年头四个月，工业总产值逐月提高
    据新华社济南十七日电　山东省济南市工业战线的广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，全市工业战线呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。今年头四个月，全市工业总产值逐月提高。二月份比一月份提高百分之七点四，三月份比二月份提高百分之二十一点七，四月份又比三月份提高百分之二点七。
    济南市工厂企业的广大革命职工，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，今年以来更加广泛、深入地开展了革命大批判。广大革命职工，密切结合本单位的阶级斗争实际，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各企业的代理人所推行的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”、“生产第一”等反革命修正主义黑货。进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，绝大多数的基层单位都建立了革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的英明指示，进一步武装了广大革命职工的头脑，他们深刻认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。一小撮阶级敌人决不会甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，坚决站在阶级斗争的最前列，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏在企业内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，对他们进行了彻底的揭发批判，实行无产阶级专政，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的种种阴谋诡计，调动了广大革命职工的生产积极性，极大地推动了革命和生产的发展。济南第二机床厂，过去由于一小撮阶级敌人的挑动、破坏，长期以来没有实现革命大联合，生产计划也完不成。当全厂革命职工学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，擦亮眼睛，揪出了阶级敌人以后，迅速实现了革命大联合，生产直线上升，三、四月份都超额完成了国家计划。
    济南市工业战线广大革命职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命精神和冲天干劲，用到生产斗争和科学实验中去。济南钢铁厂的无产阶级革命派经过一百多次试验，解决了资产阶级技术“权威”认为不可能解决的问题，建成了现代化的球团竖炉，使生铁产量提高百分之五十，每年可以节约焦炭和煤炭四万多吨。许多工厂企业的技术革命和技术革新活动也十分活跃。新设计、新工艺、新产品、新设备、新工具不断出现。很多重要产品的产量和质量都稳步提高。如化肥、农用轴承、钢丝绳、烧碱、锅炉、变压器、机制纸、肥皂、甘油、酒精、胶鞋、棉纱、棉布等产品的产量，都比去年同期增长。
