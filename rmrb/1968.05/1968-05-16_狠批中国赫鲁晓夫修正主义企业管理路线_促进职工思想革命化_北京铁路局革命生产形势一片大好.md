Many stations and sections are exceeding the national transportation plan month after month, and some indicators have broken historical records. The main indicator reflecting railway transportation efficiency, the daily average number of cars loaded, is steadily increasing. In April this year, it increased by 21% compared to the first quarter, and in the first ten days of May, it increased by another 6% compared to April.

The Beijing Railway Bureau's revolutionary workers, under the banner of revolutionary criticism, are thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department have been pushing for over a decade. This has greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the people and created a situation where both revolution and production are thriving. Many stations and sections are exceeding the national transportation plan month after month, and some indicators have broken historical records. The main indicator reflecting railway transportation efficiency, the daily average number of cars loaded, is steadily increasing. In April this year, it increased by 21% compared to the first quarter; in the first ten days of May, it increased by another 6% compared to April.

The Beijing Railway Bureau has a large volume of transportation and is known as the national railway hub. Over the past decade, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department have been frantically pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line in the Beijing Railway Bureau. Internally, they emphasize "indicators first" and "profits first"; externally, they stress the special nature of railways, using cumbersome rules and regulations to restrict and punish people, without considering the coordination and cooperation between various departments of the socialist economy.

The widespread promotion of the fallacies of "indicators first" and "profits first" has greatly promoted the communist spirit.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, universally studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the command and the soul, and that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," as well as Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on the "four firsts." They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, presented facts, and reasoned to severely criticize the reactionary and harmful nature of the fallacies of "indicators first" and "profits first." The revolutionary workers recognized that the struggle between "politics first" and "indicators first" and "profits first" in enterprise management is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. It is a major issue of whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road. Revolution cannot rely on rules and regulations; it relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the ideological revolution of the people. The railway is a department of the socialist economy and must serve socialist construction and national defense construction, serving proletarian politics.

Through revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers have emphasized proletarian politics, broken the old frameworks and foreign rules of revisionism, freed themselves from the shackles of cumbersome rules and regulations, and actively served revolutionary travelers and sister enterprises. The communist spirit has been greatly promoted. The passenger transport workers, in order to better propagate Mao Zedong Thought, have turned the trains and stations into large classrooms of Mao Zedong Thought. The freight transport workers have gone out of their offices, entered sister enterprises, and helped solve specific transportation problems. The revolutionary workers of the Guye Station and the revolutionary workers of the Kaiping Coal Mine jointly arranged the coal transportation plan and organized the loading. Once, due to the failure to connect a full set of empty cars, the coal in the mining area had to be placed outside the coal storage shed and loaded again, which would inevitably cause a waste of manpower and resources for the coal mine. Therefore, they timely adjusted the empty cars stored in three parking points to the mining area, ensuring the normal production of the coal mine. Because the workers of this station actively served the coal mine and jointly formulated the coal transportation plan, the fulfillment rate of the transportation plan has significantly improved, and the transportation indicators have also increased month by month. The daily average number of cars loaded in April increased by 12.6% compared to the first quarter, and in the first ten days of May, it increased by another 14.9% compared to April, creating a record for the highest number of cars loaded per day, achieving the goal of transporting as much coal as the coal mine produces.

The working class does revolution relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, not on material incentives.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department have been promoting material incentives in enterprise management, with nearly a hundred different types of bonuses. A track worker finding a broken rail during inspection is a duty within his job, but he would still receive a reward. The revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought severely criticized this revisionist reward system. In the process of criticism, they increasingly recognized that the revisionist bonus system is a sugar-coated bullet aimed at the working class, corrupting the revolutionary will of the workers, dissolving the ranks of the working class, and attempting to make us workers undergo a "peaceful evolution." Many old workers, in the criticism meeting, recalled and compared. The bitterness of the class, the blood and tears, aroused the deep hatred of the revolutionary workers towards the old society and the small group of capitalist roaders within the party, and strengthened their deep class feelings towards the great leader Chairman Mao. They said: "We workers do revolution, not relying on material incentives, but relying on the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

Train drivers help the station load and unload goods when stopping, and station shunting workers help the locomotive crew prepare the locomotive. Due to the cooperation of dispatchers, locomotive crews, shunting crews, and loading and unloading workers, they combined their efforts, accelerating the turnover of vehicles. The revolutionary workers of the locomotive department firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "saving every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause," establishing the thought of saving coal for the revolution, and sparing no effort to tap potential. The famous "Mao Zedong Number" locomotive crew, in the first month after canceling the coal-saving bonus, saved 144 tons of coal for the state. The comrades of the 5363 locomotive crew of the Cangzhou Locomotive Section carefully picked out the burnable coal fragments from the ash and mixed them with good coal for continued burning. In 1967, they saved 246 tons of coal, more than double the amount saved in 1966. The revolutionary committee of this locomotive section summarized and promoted the advanced experience of this locomotive crew, and from December last year to April this year, the entire section saved 397 tons of coal. The revolutionary workers of the locomotive department, while completing the transportation tasks of the bureau, also dispatched personnel and locomotives to form a professional team to support the transportation of sister bureaus.

Break down the redundant administrative structure, streamline and downsize, and achieve organizational revolutionization.

In the process of criticizing the revisionist enterprise management line, the revolutionary workers deeply felt that the bloated management structure is a product of the revisionist enterprise management line. Not reforming the old management structure not only makes it difficult for the upper and lower levels to cooperate closely but also aggravates the phenomenon of cadres being detached from the masses of workers. This is a major issue related to anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. The revolutionary committees at all levels, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on "revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre group," reduced levels, merged organizations, implemented streamlining and downsizing, and achieved organizational revolutionization. Revolutionary cadres at all levels went deep into workshops and teams, labored with the workers, studied Chairman Mao's works together, engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, and grasped revolution to promote production. The members of the revolutionary committee of the Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Section discovered during labor that a small group of capitalist roaders within the section, taking advantage of the rightist reversal wind sweeping the society, deliberately created accidents and sabotaged production. The section revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, it works," launched a "living people, living events, living teaching materials" criticism activity, exposing the recent evil activities of a small group of capitalist roaders, one by one, linking them with the current situation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and conducting face-to-face criticism and struggle, repelling the enemy's new counterattack. The revolutionary workers deeply felt: "The revolutionary committee is indeed a strong command post leading us to actively attack the class enemy." They expressed that they would definitely, under the leadership of the new-born revolutionary power, launch uninterrupted and fierce attacks on the class enemy, continuously and unceasingly carry out revolutionary criticism, grasp revolution, and promote production, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义企业管理路线　促进职工思想革命化
    北京铁路局革命生产形势一片大好
    许多站、段月月超额完成国家运输计划，某些指标突破了历史上的最高水平。反映铁路运输效率的主要指标日平均装车量稳步上升，今年四月份比第一季度提高百分之二十一，五月上旬比四月份又提高百分之六
    本报讯　北京铁路局广大革命职工，高举革命大批判的旗帜，全面深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门代理人所推行的反革命修正主义企业管理路线，大大促进了人的思想革命化，革命和生产形势一片大好。许多站、段月月超额完成国家运输计划，某些指标突破了历史上的最高水平，反映铁路运输效率的主要指标：日平均装车量稳步上升，今年四月份比第一季度提高百分之二十一；五月上旬比四月份又提高百分之六。
    北京铁路局的运输量很大，被称为全国铁路枢纽。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人，十几年来在北京铁路局疯狂地推行反革命修正主义企业管理路线，对内大搞“指标第一”、“利润第一”；对外强调铁路特殊，用烦琐的规章制度卡人、罚人，不顾社会主义经济各部门之间的协调和配合。
    大批“指标第一”、“利润第一”的谬论，大大发扬共产主义的风格
    北京铁路局广大革命职工，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，普遍学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，和林副主席关于“四个第一”的指示。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，摆事实，讲道理，大批“指标第一”、“利润第一”等谬论的反动性和危害性。广大革命职工认识到，在企业管理上的“政治第一”和“指标第一”、“利润第一”之间的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题。干革命不能靠规章制度，要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠人的思想革命化。铁路是社会主义经济的一个部门，它必须为社会主义建设和国防建设服务，为无产阶级政治服务。
    通过革命大批判，广大革命职工突出无产阶级政治，大破修正主义的旧框框、洋条条，摆脱烦琐规章制度的束缚，主动地为革命旅客和兄弟企业单位服务，共产主义风格大大发扬。客运部门职工为了更好地宣传毛泽东思想，把客车和车站办成了毛泽东思想的大课堂。货运职工走出办公室，深入兄弟企业，帮助解决运输上的具体问题。古冶站革命职工和开滦煤矿革命职工一起安排运煤计划，组织装车。有一次由于整列空车接续不上，矿区的煤就要放在储煤仓外边，再装车，必然给煤矿造成人力物力浪费。于是，他们把存放在三个停车地点的空车及时调到矿区，保证了煤矿正常生产。由于这个站职工主动为煤矿服务，共同制订运煤计划，运输方案兑现率显著提高，运输指标也月月提高。日平均装车量四月份比第一季度提高百分之十二点六，五月上旬又比四月份提高百分之十四点九，创造了日装车数最高纪录，做到了煤矿产多少，车拉多少。
    工人阶级干革命，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，不靠物质刺激
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人，过去在企业管理方面大搞物质刺激，所设的奖金名目就有近百种。巡道工在巡道时发现钢轨折断，这本来是职责内的事，但是也要给奖。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，狠狠地批判了这种修正主义的奖励制度。他们在批判的过程中，越来越清楚的认识到：修正主义的奖金制度，就是射向工人阶级的一颗颗糖衣炮弹，它腐蚀工人的革命意志，瓦解工人阶级队伍，企图使我们工人“和平演变”。许多老工人，在批判会上进行回忆对比。阶级苦、血泪仇，激发了广大革命职工对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的无比仇恨，增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情。他们说：“我们工人阶级干革命，不靠物质刺激，靠的是伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
    火车司机在停车的时候，帮助车站装卸货物，车站调车人员也帮助机车组整备机车。由于调度人员、机车组、调车组、装卸工等几方面开展协作，拧成一股劲，加速了车辆的周转。机务部门的革命职工，牢记毛主席的“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的教导，树立为革命节煤的思想，千方百计地挖掘潜力。著名的“毛泽东号”机车组，取消节煤奖的第一个月份，就为国家节煤一百四十四吨。沧州机务段五三六三机车组的同志，精心把炉灰里能燃烧的碎煤拣出来，掺在好煤里继续烧用。一九六七年，他们节煤二百四十六吨，比一九六六年多节约一倍多。这个机务段的革命委员会总结推广了这个机车组的先进经验，去年十二月至今年四月份，全段节煤三百九十七吨。机务部门的革命职工在完成本局运输任务的同时，还抽调人员和机车，组成专业队，支援兄弟局运输。
    打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，实现组织革命化
    在批判修正主义企业管理路线的过程中，广大革命职工深刻地感到，臃肿的管理机构，是修正主义企业管理路线的产物。不改革旧的管理机构，不仅使上下不能密切配合，更助长干部脱离广大工人群众的现象，这是关系到反修防修的大问题。各级革命委员会，按照毛主席关于“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，减少层次，合并机构，实行精兵简政，实现组织革命化。广大革命干部，深入到车间、班组，同工人一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起抓革命，促生产。石家庄车辆段革命委员会成员在劳动中发现段内的一小撮走资派趁社会上刮起的右倾翻案风，有意制造事故，破坏生产。段革命委员会遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，开展了“活人活事活教材”的批判活动，把一小撮走资派最近的罪恶活动，一件件地摆出来，同当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争形势联系起来，进行面对面的批判斗争，击退了阶级敌人的新反扑。广大革命职工深有体会地说：“革命委员会真不愧为领导我们向阶级敌人主动进攻的坚强指挥部。”他们表示：一定要在新生的革命政权的领导下，向阶级敌人发动不停顿的、猛烈的进攻，持续不断地开展革命大批判，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，夺取革命、生产的更大胜利。
