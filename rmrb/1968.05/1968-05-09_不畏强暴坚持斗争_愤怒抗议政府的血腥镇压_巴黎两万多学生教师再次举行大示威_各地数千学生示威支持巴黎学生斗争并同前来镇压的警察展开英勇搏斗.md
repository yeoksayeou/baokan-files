Paris students and teachers, numbering over 20,000, staged a massive demonstration on the evening of May 7th, expressing their outrage at the French government's bloody suppression of the student movement. In the face of fully armed police, the demonstrators fearlessly marched through the bustling streets of Paris; they briefly controlled the city center and raised a vibrant red flag at the Arc de Triomphe.

On May 6th, the French authorities deployed a large number of police to brutally suppress university students demanding reforms to the existing education system, injuring and arresting nearly a thousand students. This fascist atrocity has further enraged French students and drawn widespread condemnation from the public. The French ruling class is deeply troubled by this situation. On May 7th, President Charles de Gaulle was forced to personally address the nation, openly threatening the students and declaring that "opposition must not be allowed in universities" and that "students must not use violence on the streets."

De Gaulle's threats did not intimidate the Paris students; instead, they fueled their indignation. In the evening of May 7th, they organized a demonstration with more than twice the number of participants as the previous day, marching through Paris for over six hours. They protested against the police brutality, opposed the decaying education system, and demanded the release of arrested students. Starting from the southern part of Paris, they passed through the university district, crossed the Seine River, and marched through the city center, demonstrating in front of the Presidential Palace, the Élysée Palace. De Gaulle was terrified of the demonstrators and quickly mobilized a large number of armed police to form multiple layers of security around the Élysée Palace. The students fearlessly confronted the police, wearing helmets and carrying shields, showing their contempt and mockery. They carried red flags, chanted slogans, marched through the city center, sang the "Internationale" under the Arc de Triomphe, and raised a red flag at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The students' demonstration received widespread support, with many workers and citizens spontaneously joining the procession along the way.

In the early hours of May 8th, the march of over 20,000 students and teachers returned to the left bank of the Seine River. During the demonstration, they marched over 20 kilometers. Near the University of Paris, a large number of police set up barricades, preventing the demonstrators from passing, and once again launched a frenzied attack on the students using high-pressure water cannons, tear gas, and batons. The students seized the police's water cannons, picked up stones from the road, and tore down roadside barriers, using overturned cars and stones to build barricades, fighting bravely against the police. Many passersby joined the students, resisting the police's savage suppression.

The Paris students' brave struggles over the past few days have resonated strongly across France. In cities like Toulouse, Montpellier, and Rennes, thousands of students held demonstrations, supporting the Paris students' struggle and engaging in fierce battles with the police sent to suppress them.

　　不畏强暴坚持斗争　愤怒抗议政府的血腥镇压
　　巴黎两万多学生教师再次举行大示威
　　各地数千学生示威支持巴黎学生斗争并同前来镇压的警察展开英勇搏斗
    新华社八日讯　巴黎消息：被警察暴行激怒的法国学生、教师二万多人，七日晚在巴黎举行声势更加浩大的示威游行，愤怒抗议法国政府血腥镇压学生运动的罪行。在全副武装的警察面前，示威者不畏强暴，昂首阔步地穿过巴黎的闹市；他们一度控制了巴黎市中心区，并在凯旋门前升起鲜艳的红旗。
    法国当局六日出动大批警察血腥镇压要求改革现行教育制度的大学生，打伤和逮捕学生近千人的法西斯暴行，激起了法国学生更大的愤怒，受到了法国公众的谴责。法国统治集团对此十分头痛。法国总统戴高乐七日不得不亲自出面发表谈话，露骨地威胁学生，叫嚷什么“不能让大学里”有“反对者”，“不能让（学生）在大街上使用暴力”。
    戴高乐的威胁不但没有吓倒巴黎学生，反而使学生们更加义愤填膺。七日傍晚，他们组织起比六日示威的人数多一倍的两万多人的队伍，在巴黎举行了六个多小时的示威游行，抗议警察暴行，反对腐朽的教育制度，要求释放被捕的同学。他们从巴黎市区南部出发，经过大学区，越过塞纳河，穿过闹市，在法国总统府爱丽舍宫前举行示威。戴高乐对示威的群众怕得要命，急忙调动大批武装警察在爱丽舍宫周围组成重重的警戒线。学生们不畏强暴，对头戴钢盔、手执钢盾的警察表示蔑视和嘲笑。他们打着红旗，高呼口号，穿过巴黎市中心，在凯旋门下高唱《国际歌》，并且在无名英雄墓上升起一面红旗。学生的示威得到广泛的支持，许多工人和市民沿途自动参加示威行列。
    八日凌晨，二万多学生和教师的游行队伍重新回到塞纳河左岸，他们在示威游行中共走了二十多公里。在巴黎大学附近，大批警察筑起路障，不让示威的队伍通过，并且使用高压水龙、催泪弹和警棍又一次对学生进行疯狂的袭击。学生们抢过警察的水龙，挖起路上的石块，拔起路旁的栏杆，用翻倒的汽车和石块筑起街垒，同警察展开英勇的搏斗。不少路过的市民同学生们站在一起，对警察的野蛮镇压进行反击。
    巴黎学生连日来英勇的斗争，在法国各地引起强烈的反响。图卢兹、蒙彼利埃、雷纳等城市都有几千学生举行示威游行，支持巴黎学生的斗争，并且同前来镇压的警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
