Japanese progressive friends recently spoke to Chinese journalists, warmly praising the great Marxist-Leninist historical document—the CPC Central Committee's May 16, 1966 "Notice"—which was formulated under the personal direction of the great teacher Chairman Mao. They pointed out that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era. Chairman Mao has creatively and epoch-makingly developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Japanese revolutionary leftist Anzai Koji said: Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The May 16, 1966 "Notice" of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, formulated under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great Marxist-Leninist document. For the first time in history, Comrade Mao Zedong has correctly solved, both theoretically and practically, the problem of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, strengthening the proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and ensuring the path to communism. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's greatest contribution to Marxism-Leninism. This great historical document shows that only the great Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era.

Anzai said: After the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries, a most serious and major problem has been brought to the attention of all Marxist-Leninists around the world: how can a proletarian dictatorship, which has already won a revolutionary victory, prevent capitalist restoration, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and advance towards communism? This is a new problem that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin did not completely solve and could not completely solve. True Marxist-Leninists, in order to fulfill their great historical mission, must correctly solve this problem both theoretically and practically. It is the contemporary Lenin—Comrade Mao Zedong—who has correctly solved this problem both theoretically and practically.

Anzai said: Comrade Mao Zedong not only comprehensively and scientifically summarized the experience of proletarian dictatorship in China, but also comprehensively and scientifically summarized the experience of proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. With his great vision, he led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history. The Chinese people, in this great revolutionary movement, thoroughly exposed the bourgeois agents lurking within the Party, the government, and the military, and overthrew them, seizing their power. The glorious victory of the proletarian cultural revolution has given infinite inspiration and encouragement to the Japanese people and the people of the world who want revolution, as well as to true Marxist-Leninists.

The chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), Miyazaki Seiken, said: Chairman Mao, with his grand plan and innovative ideas, led the Chinese people in a proletarian cultural revolution unprecedented in history. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution not only has great significance for the Chinese revolution but also has great significance for the international communist movement and human history.

Miyazaki said: Chairman Mao has made great contributions to Marxism-Leninism and the world revolution. The proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao has solved, both theoretically and practically, the problem of preventing capitalist restoration after the proletariat seizes power. Chairman Mao has dialectically solved the problem of the relationship between the economic base and the superstructure in Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era.

Miyazaki said: The path pointed out by Chairman Mao in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a path that all revolutionary people in the world must take. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution will make and is making contributions to the revolutionary cause being carried out by the people of various countries according to the different conditions of each country.

The permanent councilor of the "China Research Institute" in Japan, Iwanami Sanzeno, said: The great leader Chairman Mao has comprehensively summarized the experience of the world proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, scientifically proposed the theory of class and class struggle under socialist conditions, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage.

Iwanami said: Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The proletarian cultural revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao has most profoundly summarized the essence of the proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution are a great contribution to Marxism-Leninism.

Iwanami said: The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has ensured that the socialist mountains and rivers in China will never change color. The victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has given infinite inspiration to Japanese and world revolutionaries, as well as to oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, and has thoroughly smashed the slander and defamation of American imperialism and its accomplices, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. He said: The profound influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is increasingly being recognized. Today, the new upsurge in the struggle of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world is inseparable from the influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

Japanese famous writer Ema Shu said: The May 16, 1966 "Notice" of the CPC Central Committee is Chairman Mao's call to the Chinese proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, that is, modern revisionists. He said: The series of major issues raised in the "Notice" not only concern the future of China but also the future of the world revolution, including Japan. This document will continue to have a profound impact, not only at present but also in the future.

Ema said: The Chinese proletariat and revolutionary masses, in response to Chairman Mao's great call in the "Notice," have engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Chinese Communist Party. Now, revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organs—revolutionary committees—are emerging in various places in China. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has achieved brilliant victories. He is deeply convinced that the broad revolutionary masses in China will continue to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Ema expressed that the Japanese revolutionary people, under the great situation of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, will actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and strengthen the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionism.

    日本进步朋友热烈赞扬中共中央《通知》是伟大的马列主义文件
    毛主席划时代地创造性地发展了马列主义
    中国无产阶级文化大革命对国际共产主义运动和人类历史具有重大意义
    新华社东京十五日电　日本各界进步朋友最近向中国记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬在伟大导师毛主席亲自主持下制定的伟大的马克思列宁主义历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。他们指出，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，毛主席划时代地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到毛泽东思想的崭新的阶段。
    日本革命左派安斋库治说：毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。在毛泽东同志亲自主持下制定的中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义文件。毛泽东同志在历史上第一次从理论上、实践上正确地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下，继续进行革命，加强无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟、保证走向共产主义道路的问题。这是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的又一最伟大的贡献。这一伟大历史文件表明，唯有伟大的毛泽东思想，才是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    安斋说：在苏联和其他一些社会主义国家出现了资本主义复辟以后，一个最严肃、最重大的问题，突出地提到全世界马克思列宁主义者面前，这就是：已经取得革命胜利的无产阶级专政的国家怎样才能防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，走向共产主义？这是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林没有完全解决，也不可能完全解决的新的问题。真正的马克思列宁主义者，为了完成自己的伟大历史使命，必须从理论上、实践上正确地解决这一问题。正是当代的列宁——毛泽东同志从理论上、实践上正确地解决了这一问题。
    安斋说：毛泽东同志不仅全面地、科学地总结了中国无产阶级专政的经验，而且全面地、科学地总结了苏联及其他社会主义国家无产阶级专政的经验，以他的伟大气魄，领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命。中国人民在这一伟大的革命运动中，彻底揭发了盘踞在党、政府和军队内的资产阶级代理人，把他们打翻在地，夺了他们的权。无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，给了日本和全世界要革命的人民以及真正的马克思列宁主义者以无限的鼓舞和激励。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民说：毛主席以宏伟的计划和独创的思想，领导中国人民进行了历史上前所未有的无产阶级文化大革命。中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对中国革命具有重大意义，而且对国际共产主义运动和人类历史具有重大意义。
    宫崎说：毛主席对马克思列宁主义和世界革命作出了伟大的贡献。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，从理论上和实践上解决了无产阶级在夺取政权后防止资本主义复辟的问题，毛主席辩证地解决了马克思列宁主义关于经济基础和上层建筑之间的关系。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    宫崎说：毛主席在中国无产阶级文化大革命中指出的道路，是全世界革命人民必经之路。中国无产阶级文化大革命，必将和正在为世界各国人民根据各个国家的不同条件所进行的革命事业作出贡献。
    日本“中国研究所”常任理事岩村三千夫说：伟大领袖毛主席全面总结了世界无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的经验，科学地提出了在社会主义条件下阶级和阶级斗争的理论，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。
    岩村说：毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席最精辟地概括了无产阶级文化大革命的实质。毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，是对马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献。
    岩村说：中国无产阶级文化大革命，保证了中国社会主义江山永不变色。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，给日本和全世界革命者以及被压迫人民、被压迫民族以无限鼓舞，同时彻底地粉碎了美帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义和各国反动派的诬蔑和诽谤。他说：中国无产阶级文化大革命的深远影响，越来越被人们所认识。今天，全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族斗争的新高涨，是和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响分不开的。
    日本著名作家江马修说：中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是毛主席号召中国无产阶级和广大革命群众向党内一小撮走资派，即现代修正主义分子进行战斗的宣战书。他说：《通知》中提出的一系列重大问题，不仅关系到中国的前途，也关系到包括日本在内的世界革命的前途。这一文件不仅在当前，而且今后将继续发生深远的影响。
    江马说：中国无产阶级和广大革命群众，响应毛主席在《通知》中发出的伟大号召，同中国共产党内一小撮走资派进行了你死我活的斗争，现在，在中国各地联翩出现了革命“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会。中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌胜利。他深信，中国广大革命群众将继续遵循毛主席的伟大教导，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    江马表示日本革命人民将在中国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势鼓舞下，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，加强反对美日反动派和现代修正主义的斗争。
