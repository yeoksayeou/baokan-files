Recently, the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Komsomolskaya Pravda* published an article discussing the issue of "happiness," in which it posed a strange question to Soviet youth: "In which century would you like to be born?" A young man named Valery gave an equally strange answer, saying he would like to be born in the 17th or 18th century. As for the reason, it was even more bizarre: because there were pirates, and he hoped to become one of them.

This is utterly shameless! This Soviet revisionist newspaper is exploiting the unhealthy psychology of some Soviet youth who have been poisoned by revisionism, blatantly promoting their bourgeois concept of happiness.

What is happiness? Marx once answered his daughter's question by saying: "Your understanding of happiness: ... struggle."

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly" and "Be selfless and dedicated to others." For a revolutionary, the greatest happiness is to fight selflessly for communism and serve the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly.

Under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin, Soviet youth understood this principle. In the days of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Soviet Union produced many heroes who shone with the light of communism. They bravely sacrificed themselves to defend the Soviet motherland and worked tirelessly to build socialism. They were truly the heroic offspring of the great October Revolution.

But let's take a look at the so-called "happiness" promoted by *Komsomolskaya Pravda*! In their view, "happiness" is to become an "outstanding expert" and a "master of one's craft," to have "endless money." Moreover, "happiness" also means "going to the bay in the morning" and "going to the café" in the evening, and so on. What is the difference between these things and the decadent lifestyle of the declining capitalist world in the West?

The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to fully restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, has been promoting "liberalization" and "Westernization" at home for many years, euphemistically calling it "modernization." They use this to poison Soviet youth and serve their bourgeois dictatorship.

Since the Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed Lenin and Stalin and betrayed the great October Socialist Revolution, they have inevitably degenerated into accomplices of imperialism and agents of the bourgeoisie. They have meticulously planned to lead the younger generation of the Soviet Union down the path of corruption and degeneration.

However, the broad masses of the Soviet people and the broad masses of Soviet youth are revolutionary. They will certainly rise up to fight, smash the criminal rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, and settle accounts with all the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique!

　　苏修腐蚀青年的罪证
　　杰声
    最近，苏修《共青团真理报》在一篇讨论“幸福”问题的报道中，向苏联青年提出了一个奇怪的问题：“你愿意生在哪个世纪？”一个名叫瓦列里的小伙子回答也很奇怪，他说他愿意“生在十七世纪至十八世纪”。至于理由，那就更加奇怪了：因为那时“有海盗，我希望成为他们中的一个”。
    这简直无耻透顶！这家苏修报纸正利用今天受修正主义毒害的一些苏联青年的不健康心理，大肆宣扬他们的资产阶级幸福观。
    什么是幸福？马克思在当年回答他女儿的提问时说：“您对幸福的理解：……斗争”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“全心全意地为人民服务”，“毫不利己专门利人”。对一个革命者来说，奋不顾身地为共产主义而斗争，全心全意地为广大人民服务，就是最大的幸福。
    在列宁和斯大林教导下的苏联青年，是懂得这个道理的。在那社会主义革命和社会主义建设的年代，苏联涌现出许多闪烁着共产主义光辉的英雄人物。他们为保卫苏维埃祖国而英勇献身，为建设社会主义而忘我劳动。他们不愧是伟大十月革命的英雄儿女。
    可是，让我们看看《共青团真理报》宣扬的所谓“幸福”吧！在他们看来，“幸福”就是成为一个“优秀的专家，本行的能手”，就是有“无数的钱”。此外，“幸福”还意味着“清晨去海湾”，晚上“去咖啡馆”等等。这些玩意儿，与没落腐朽的西方资本主义世界那一套生活方式又有什么两样呢？
    苏修叛徒集团为了在苏联全面复辟资本主义，多年来在国内大搞“自由化”和“西方化”，美其名曰“现代化”，以此毒化苏联青年，为维护他们的资产阶级专政服务。
    苏修叛徒集团既然背叛了列宁和斯大林，背叛了伟大的十月社会主义革命，就必然堕落为帝国主义的帮凶和资产阶级掮客。他们精心蓄谋，要把苏联青年一代引向腐化堕落的道路。
    但是，苏联广大的人民和广大的青年是要革命的。他们一定要起来进行斗争，打碎苏修叛徒集团的罪恶统治，清算苏修叛徒集团的一切反革命罪行！
