Actively responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, North Vietnamese workers, fearless of hardships and sacrifices, have overcome countless difficulties, striven for production, and bravely fought, achieving dual victories in production and combat.

Over the past year, as the U.S. imperialists escalated their aggression against North Vietnam, indiscriminately bombing various industrial and mining enterprises, the heroic Vietnamese workers were not intimidated by the bombs. They stood firm at their posts, striving to produce more for the country, meeting the needs of the war and the people's livelihood. During visits to various parts of North Vietnam, reporters witnessed the brave and unyielding spirit of the broad masses of workers. Despite the presence of U.S. aggressor planes around the factories, the workers remained steadfast at their production posts. Sometimes, amidst the explosions of bombs, furnaces of molten iron were poured, and bags of agricultural chemicals were packaged. When they had to leave their production posts, they immediately entered combat positions, using various weapons to counterattack the U.S. aggressor planes. Once the enemy planes left, they immediately resumed production. Workers at a certain power plant said, "The U.S. aggressors attempt to intimidate us with bombs, but this is futile. We resolutely carry out Chairman Ho's battle call and will fight until there is not a single U.S. aggressor on our soil." Currently, many power plants in North Vietnam have been damaged by U.S. aggressor planes, but the workers have ensured the supply of electricity.

In the war environment, the broad masses of workers have used every means to think and find ways to improve technology, producing more products. Workers at the Nam Dinh Machinery Factory have proposed over a hundred rationalization suggestions since the beginning of the year, significantly increasing labor productivity and completing nearly the full year's production plan in the first three months. Workers at the Ninh Giang Textile Mill in Nam Ha Province, although mostly new workers, have completed this year's first-quarter production plan ahead of schedule, producing twice as many products as in the third quarter of last year. The heroic workers of Quang Binh Province have spent tens of thousands of workdays digging air-raid shelters and communication trenches, but have also achieved production successes. Workers in Vinh Linh actively serve agricultural production, frequently going to the countryside to repair agricultural tools and helping farmers test new tools.

Particularly praiseworthy are the workers in the transportation sector, who have fought day and night on the transportation lines bombed by U.S. aggressor planes, achieving great feats. They have launched competitions such as "ensuring timely and safe crossing of ferries," successfully completing this year's first-quarter transportation plan. Now, nearly three hundred workers in the transportation sector have been awarded the glorious title of "Anti-American National Salvation Hero." The Fifth Transportation Team, awarded the Third-Class Labor Medal by the government, has consecutively overfulfilled the plan by 3% to 15% for several months. Quang Binh Province is a key area bombed by U.S. aggressor planes, but the transportation sector workers had completed 51% of the annual plan by March 20.

While striving to complete production tasks, the broad masses of North Vietnamese workers also actively participate in combat, bravely counterattacking U.S. aggressor planes. Now, the majority of young workers in various factories and enterprises have joined the self-defense teams. Every factory, every ferry, every car team has armed workers. Factory self-defense team members form anti-aircraft teams, observation teams, and medical teams. They are both the backbone of production and experts in shooting down enemy planes. Together with the Vietnamese People's Army Air Defense Department and militia, they have laid a net of traps for U.S. aggressor planes. Just the self-defense team members from Hong Ky Coal Mine, Haiphong Port, Haiphong Cement Plant, and the "March 8" Textile Mill have shot down dozens of U.S. aggressor planes. The North Vietnamese workers' self-defense teams are being tempered in the flames of war, continuously establishing new merits in the struggle to resist America and save the nation.

　　越南北方工人取得生产和战斗双胜利
　　新华社河内三十日电　本社记者报道：战斗在反美斗争前线的越南北方工人，积极响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，不怕艰苦牺牲，排除万难，努力生产，勇敢战斗，取得了生产和战斗的双胜利。
    在过去一年里，美帝国主义对越南北方的侵略战争不断“升级”，滥肆轰炸各地工矿企业。但是，英雄的越南工人并没有被炸弹吓倒，他们坚守岗位，努力争取为国家多生产产品，满足战争和人民生活的需要。记者在越南北方各地采访时曾亲眼看到，广大工人的勇敢不屈的英雄形象。尽管美国强盗飞机在工厂附近活动，工人们仍然坚守在生产岗位上。有时就在炸弹的爆炸声中，一炉炉铁水出炉了，一袋袋农药包装好了。当他们不得不离开生产岗位时，他们就立刻进入战斗工事，用各种武  器反击美国强盗飞机。敌机走了，他们就立即抓紧时间生产。某发电厂的几位工人同志说得好：“美国侵略者企图用炸弹吓倒我们，这是妄想。我们坚决实现胡主席的战斗号召，一直战斗到我们国土上没有一个美国侵略者的影子时为止。”目前，越南北方许多发电厂都遭到了美国强盗飞机的破坏，但是工人们仍然保证了电力供应。
    在战争的环境中，广大工人千方百计地动脑筋，想办法，改进技术，以便多生产出一些产品。南定机器厂的工人，今年开始以来已经提出了一百多条合理化建议，大大提高了劳动生产率，在今年头三个月就完成了近全年的生产计划。南河省宁江纺织厂的工人虽然绝大部分是新工人，但是提前完成了今年第一季度的生产计划，生产出的产品等于去年第三季度产品的两倍。英雄的广平省工人要付出上万个工作日去挖防空洞、交通壕，但在生产中也取得了成绩。永灵的工人积极为农业生产服务，他们经常下乡修理农具，并帮助农民试用新农具。
    特别受人称赞的是交通运输部门的工人，他们日夜奋战在美国强盗飞机轰炸的交通运输线上，立下了功勋。他们开展了“保证及时安全过渡口”等竞赛运动，胜利地完成了今年第一季度运输计划。现在，交通运输部门已有近三百名工人，获得了“抗美救国勇士”的光荣称号。荣获政府授予三级劳动勋章的第五运输队曾连续几个月超额百分之三到十五完成了计划。河静省是美国强盗飞机轰炸的重点地区，但交通运输部门的工人到三月二十日就完成了全年计划的百分之五十一。
    越南北方广大工人在努力完成生产任务的同时，还积极参加战斗，英勇反击美国强盗飞机。现在各地工厂企业的绝大多数的青年工人都参加了自卫队。每一座工厂，每一个渡口，每一个汽车队，都有武装起来的工人。工厂的自卫队员组成了猎机组、观察组、救护组等。他们既是生产的骨干又是打敌机的能手。他们同越南人民军防空部队和民兵一起，给美国强盗飞机布下了天罗地网。单是广宁鸿基煤矿、海防港口、海防水泥厂、“三·八”纺织厂等单位的自卫队员就已经击落了成十架美国强盗飞机。越南北方的工人自卫队正在战火中锻炼成长，在抗美救国斗争中不断建立新的战功。
