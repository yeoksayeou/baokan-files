Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Sichuan is excellent and getting better and better. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread throughout the province's cities and countryside are getting better and better, the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely, Mao Zedong Thought is being widely propagated, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination have been further consolidated and developed.

The excellent situation in Sichuan is the result of the province's proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses, under the strong support and help of the People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To hold study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in Sichuan, following this instruction of Chairman Mao, have in a short time set up study classes in factories, rural areas, schools, shops, and offices. So far, the province has held over 470,000 study classes of various types, with over 21 million people participating. In these study classes, the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, with deep proletarian feelings of limitless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Many regions' leaders and representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations, following Chairman Mao's teachings, engage in self-criticism in study classes, oppose bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. Now, over 100 counties in the province have achieved revolutionary unity on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought. The provincial capital Chengdu, the southern city of Zigong, and many prefectures, autonomous prefectures, counties, and cities have established revolutionary committees. Some counties have established revolutionary committees in most of their people's communes.

The study classes held in various places focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, criticizing the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents within the party, and firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many places' study classes invite old workers and old poor peasants to talk about the history of their factories, villages, families, and their own stories of emancipation, hold exhibitions of real objects, eat bitter meals, and denounce the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords, and capitalists in oppressing and exploiting the laboring people. Some places have carried out activities to recall the bitterness of being persecuted by China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through the living education of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly heightened, further deepening the broad revolutionary masses' limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They deeply feel that following Chairman Mao closely and being loyal to Chairman Mao is happiness and victory.

The proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in Sichuan, following Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, forming a vast revolutionary army, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, launching relentless and fierce attacks on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Southwest China and Sichuan. The entire province's cities and countryside are battlefields of revolutionary criticism. With the help of the People's Liberation Army and the leading cadres trained in the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought in various places, the broad revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, use various forms such as criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, big-character posters, cartoons, and criticism columns to launch fierce attacks on the class enemies. The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation fronts throughout the province, in conjunction with the actual situation in their departments, expose and criticize the black goods of "profits first," "technology first," and "material incentives" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents. They say that China's Khrushchev and his agents promote these black goods to restore capitalism, making us workers slaves to the capitalists again. We must thoroughly criticize and expose these revisionist elements. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside fiercely criticize the black goods of "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points first," and "material incentives" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents. The poor and lower-middle peasants say that if we follow the line of these class enemies, we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice, and socialist China will change color. China's Khrushchev and his agents within the party are of the same ilk as the Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords, and capitalists. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," thoroughly defeat China's Khrushchev and his agents within the party, steadfastly walk the socialist road, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution of the proletariat under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses in Sichuan have carried out revolutionary criticism more broadly and deeply. The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses in various places criticize bourgeois reactionary thoughts from the right or ultra-left, firmly oppose right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, smash the counter-revolutionary winds of reversal stirred up by the class enemies, expose hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and severely strike at the enemies of the proletariat, further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the priority, construction is also within it." The revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist line, firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, makes the broad revolutionary masses more deeply understand the great truth of "navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," further promoting the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Various places have universally established systems for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Families, courtyards, and fields have all become classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Many illiterate or semi-literate poor and lower-middle peasants, housewives, and elderly people, holding the red books of Chairman Mao's works, ask others to teach them word by word and explain sentence by sentence. The broad revolutionary masses express their determination to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下
    四川无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好
    全省有两千一百多万人参加了毛泽东思想学习班，有一百多个县的两派革命群众组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命大联合，很多专区、自治州、县、市建立了革委会
    新华社成都三十日电  在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，四川省无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，越来越好。遍及全省城乡的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，革命大批判的熊熊烈火越烧越旺，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，革命大联合和革命三结合得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    四川省的大好形势，是全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席一系列最新指示的结果。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”四川省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，遵照毛主席的这一指示，在很短时间内，在工厂、农村、学校、商店和机关，普遍办起了学习班。到目前为止，全省已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四十七万多期，参加学习的达两千一百多万人。在学习班里，无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”许多地区两派革命群众组织的头头和代表，遵照毛主席的教导，在学习班里斗私批修，各自多做自我批评，反对资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。现在，全省有一百多个县的两派革命群众组织，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命大联合。四川省会成都市和川南重镇自贡市，以及很多专区、自治州、县、市，已经建立起革命委员会。有些县大部分人民公社也建立了革命委员会。
    各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的斗争，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。许多地方的学习班，请老工人、老贫农讲厂史、村史、家史和自己的翻身史，举办实物展览，吃忆苦饭，控诉国民党反动派、地主和资本家压迫剥削劳动人民的罪行。有些地方开展了忆受中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜的活动。通过活生生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，大大提高了广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步加深了广大革命群众无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情。他们深刻地体会到，永远紧跟毛主席，无限忠于毛主席，就是幸福，就是胜利。
    四川省无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，遵照毛主席的教导，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在西南和四川的代理人，展开了不停顿的猛烈进攻。全省城乡到处是革命大批判的战场。在人民解放军的帮助下，在各地毛泽东思想学习班培训出的大批骨干分子的带动下，广大革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，运用批判会、控诉会、大字报、漫画、大批判专栏等各种形式，口诛笔伐，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。全省工业、交通运输战线上的广大革命职工，结合本部门的实际，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“利润挂帅”、“技术挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行这一套黑货，目的就是要复辟资本主义，让我们工人再给资本家当牛马。我们一定要把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子批深批透，斗倒斗臭。农村广大贫下中农狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。贫下中农说，要是依了这一小撮阶级敌人那一套，我们贫下中农就要吃二遍苦，社会主义的中国就要变颜色。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人，同国民党反动派、地主、资本家是一路货。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人彻底打倒，坚定地走社会主义道路，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在毛主席最新指示的指引下，四川省无产阶级革命派和革命群众把革命大批判更广泛更深入地开展下去。各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，批判来自右的或极“左”方面的资产阶级反动思想，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎阶级敌人刮起的翻案妖风，挖出隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，狠狠地打击无产阶级的敌人，使革命大联合和革命三结合得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”革命的大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使广大革命群众更深刻地领会了“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”这个伟大的真理，进一步推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。各地普遍建立了活学活用毛主席著作的制度。家庭、院落、田头，都成了学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。许多不识字或识字很少的贫下中农、家庭妇女和白发苍苍的老人，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书毛主席著作，请别人一字一字地教，听别人一句一句地讲。广大革命群众表示，一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
