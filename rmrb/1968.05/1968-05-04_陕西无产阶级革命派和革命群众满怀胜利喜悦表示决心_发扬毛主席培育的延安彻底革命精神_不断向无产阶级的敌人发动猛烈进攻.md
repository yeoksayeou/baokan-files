The revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Shaanxi, filled with the joy of victory, express their determination to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit fostered by Chairman Mao, and to launch relentless attacks on the enemies of the proletariat.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Shaanxi, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and the joy of victory as they celebrate the glorious birth of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees. They enthusiastically acclaim another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! They enthusiastically acclaim another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

On this joyous day, scenes of jubilation are everywhere in various parts of Shaanxi Province. The broad masses of revolutionary people and revolutionary cadres are holding meetings and various celebratory activities. With boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they carry giant portraits of Chairman Mao and hold up bright red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The East is Red" with all their hearts. They sincerely wish Chairman Mao longevity! Longevity! They excitedly declare that they will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as their shining example, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, advance victoriously, develop the excellent situation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The broad masses of revolutionary people and revolutionary cadres in various parts of Shaanxi Province, while joyously celebrating the victorious birth of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees, have studied with excitement the editorial in the "People's Daily" and "PLA Daily": "The Spirit of Yan'an Shines Forever." They resolutely declare that they will definitely inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit fostered by Chairman Mao in Yan'an, launch relentless attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, further deepen and persist in carrying out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Lantao, Zhao Shouyi, and Li Qiming and their agents in Northwest and Shaanxi, and thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison they have spread in various aspects. They will root out all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements. At present, they will firmly oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, resolutely smash the right opportunist wind of reversing verdicts, and will not allow a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to reverse verdicts. They will not allow the capitalist reactionary line to reverse verdicts.

In the past two days, the members of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees, as well as many responsible comrades of revolutionary committees at the prefecture, city, county, and grassroots levels, have, amidst the joyous shouts celebrating the glorious birth of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees, reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions on "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, seize power for the proletariat, use power for the proletariat, and build the revolutionary committees into revolutionary leadership teams that are connected with the masses. The responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee said that after the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, they will grasp the fundamentals, place the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, and organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They will use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, transform everything, and promote everything. They will inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit personally fostered by Chairman Mao in Yan'an, that is, the Marxist-Leninist thorough revolutionary spirit and the proletarian spirit of hard struggle, lead the broad masses of the people to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let the spirit of Yan'an shine forever, and build Shaanxi Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The revolutionary masses in prefectures, cities, counties, and grassroots units that are in the process of realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination are determined to, under the principle of revolution, realize the great unity of revolution according to systems, industries, and classes, correctly solve the problem of cadres, and establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination.

The broad revolutionary workers in all industrial and mining enterprises across the province and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside have, on this joyous day, expressed their determination to firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and celebrate the glorious birth of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees with practical actions, vowing to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of various parts of Shaanxi Province, while celebrating the establishment of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committees, have enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi in the "three supports, two militaries" work. They are determined to hold high the banner of "support the army and love the people," launch larger-scale support-the-army activities, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, love and support the People's Liberation Army, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
