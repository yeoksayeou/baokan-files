A short time after I began working in the Revolutionary Committee, the comrades from the 8341st Unit who were supporting the left sent me a quote from Chairman Mao: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." I studied this great teaching of Chairman Mao repeatedly. Reflecting on how new cadres, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieved great feats, I decided to humbly learn from the new cadres in the Revolutionary Committee and cooperate with them to build the Revolutionary Committee into a strong revolutionary combat command center.

In the Revolutionary Committee, I am responsible for the work of the life and logistics department. Working with me is the new cadre Comrade Bai Xishan, who was originally a truck driver. He loves Chairman Mao and strives to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. His stance is firm, he knows right from wrong, and he has a strong revolutionary spirit. After being elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee, he has always maintained his revolutionary enthusiasm. On one hand, he actively leads the masses to launch fierce attacks on class enemies, and on the other hand, he participates in various physical labor with the worker masses. Sometimes he is so busy that he doesn't even go home on Sundays. Seeing such a person, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is so respectable and lovable, it gives me boundless strength. We often study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, using the shining examples of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain to reflect on ourselves, and we engage in mutual criticism and self-criticism. From him, I learned many excellent qualities of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and at the same time, I used my own experiences of making mistakes to help him overcome his shortcomings, so that he could grow healthier.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." In the past, cadres participating in labor was often seen as a "task" to be completed. Now, I treat participating in labor as a fundamental matter of connecting with the masses. Every day, I go to the workshop, sweeping the floor from one machine to the next, so I can meet with every worker and listen to their opinions and demands. Some female workers happily told me: "In the past, when you were the deputy director, it was so difficult for us to find you and solve a problem! Now that you are the deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee, you actively come to the workshop to care about our lives, what a big change this is!" Hearing this, I thought, this is the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought!

Under the help of the comrades supporting the left and the revolutionary masses, I have raised my awareness of class struggle and line struggle, corrected some of my shortcomings and mistakes, but compared to the revolutionary transformation of the broad revolutionary masses, I still have a lot to do. In the future, I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learn more humbly and sincerely from the broad revolutionary masses, and fight together with the broad revolutionary masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    一辈子做革命群众的小学生
    北京针织总厂革命委员会副主任　张成明
    在我参加革委会工作不久，八三四一部队支左同志就联名送我一条毛主席语录：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”我反复学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，回想起新干部在文化大革命运动中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署建立的丰功伟绩，决心在革委会工作中虚心向新干部学习，同新干部合作，共同把革命委员会建设成坚强的革命战斗指挥部。
    在革命委员会中，我分工负责生活后勤部门的工作，和我合作的新干部白喜善同志，原来是一位汽车司机。他热爱毛主席，努力活学活用毛主席著作，立场坚定，爱憎分明，革命精神强。当选为革命委员会委员以后，他始终保持着革命干劲，一面积极带领群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，一面同工人群众一起参加各种体力劳动，有时忙得星期天都不肯回家。我看到毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的新人这样可敬可爱，给自己增添了无穷的力量。我们经常一起学习“老三篇”，用张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象对照自己，互相开展批评和自我批评。我从他身上学到了无产阶级革命派的许多优秀品质，同时也用自己犯错误的经验教训，帮助他克服缺点，使他更健康地成长。
    毛主席教导我们：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”过去，干部参加劳动有的是当作“任务”去完成的。现在，我把参加劳动当作联系群众的一件带根本性的大事来做。我每天都到车间，一个车挡、一个车挡地去扫地，这样我就能同每一个工人见面，倾听他们的意见和要求。有的女工高兴地对我说：“过去你当副厂长，我们有事找你，解决个问题好难啊！现在你当了革命委员会副主任，主动下车间关心我们的生活，这是多么大的变化呀！”听了这话，我想，这是毛泽东思想的无穷威力啊！
    我在支左同志和革命群众帮助下，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，改正了一些缺点错误，但比起广大革命群众思想革命化来，我做得还很不够。今后我一定要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，更加虚心诚恳地向广大革命群众学习，紧紧地同广大革命群众团结战斗在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
