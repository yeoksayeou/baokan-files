Our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out in the "May 7th Directive": "The commune peasants should take agriculture as the main task (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries), and should also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. When conditions permit, they should also set up small factories collectively and criticize the bourgeoisie." The core of Chairman Mao's great directive is to teach us to always uphold proletarian politics, to firmly grasp class struggle, and to propagate, educate, and arm the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in our brigade have always bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and steadfastly followed the brilliant path of the "May 7th Directive."

Our brigade is located on the outskirts of Xiongshan Town and is a concentrated production area for fruits and vegetables. Since the establishment of the cooperative, we have undergone numerous severe tests and repelled the capitalist forces' repeated rampant attacks, making the collective economy increasingly consolidated and strengthened. By the spring of 1965, our brigade already had nine electric wells, one truck, one hand-tractor, and more than twenty large rubber-wheeled carts. On the basis of the great development of agricultural production, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also flourished, and income increased significantly. In this favorable situation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade were not satisfied and decided to change the situation of having many people but little land and being unable to be self-sufficient in grain. We learned from the people of Dazhai, promoted the Dazhai spirit, and followed the Dazhai path, organizing forces to go to the western sea to build fields by blocking the sea. Thus, in 1965, we overcame various difficulties and enclosed a piece of over five hundred mu of barren beach, planting some rice. However, due to the high alkalinity of the beach, we only harvested tens of thousands of catties of rice in the autumn, and the project of building fields by blocking the sea was opposed by a few people with spontaneous capitalist ideas. They took the opportunity to stir up trouble, saying: "That place by the western sea is a ghostly place. In the spring, there are fierce winds and sandstorms that blow people's eyes shut, and in the summer, the barren sand beach can burn horses and snakes to death. Competing with such a place will surely result in failure and loss of both grain and money!" They also publicly calculated a big account full of the stench of "privacy": "One large truck pulling feet can earn at least two or three ten thousand yuan a year. If we also use the nursery, we can make more apple seedlings to sell, and then we will have a good life. What's the fear of little land? We can buy state-returned grain with money, why insist on struggling to death by the western sea? Isn't this begging for food with a golden bowl?"

After this wind blew, some people were bewildered by this confused account, wanting to retreat and grab money and grain, continuing to drag the state's legs. Some cadres and masses also lost confidence and enthusiasm for building fields by blocking the sea.

At this time, the brilliant "May 7th Directive" was issued. Chairman Mao called on the peasants to "also criticize the bourgeoisie." We mobilized the broad masses of commune members to repeatedly study the "May 7th Directive." Everyone realized that whether agriculture follows the Dazhai path or the path of "money as the commander," this is not a small matter but a big matter of whether to follow the socialist road. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "We are running a socialist collective economy and following the path indicated by Chairman Mao. We must not be blinded by a few unjust gains and follow the capitalist road! Chairman Mao teaches us to 'also criticize the bourgeoisie,' so we must criticize and expose the black scheme of pulling feet with trucks and the bad plan of making money from the nursery, and resolutely follow the Dazhai path!" After repeatedly studying "Qu Yuan Moves the Mountain," the militiamen and commune members said in a grand manner: "Dazhai fights the tiger, and we catch the dragon. Others rely on Mao Zedong Thought to tame the big mountain, and we also rely on Mao Zedong Thought to subdue the sea! Although we are now carrying sand and yellow soil, we will exchange them for grain in the future!"

After a fierce struggle between the two lines, we defeated the rampant attack of capitalist forces. The broad masses of commune members firmly expressed their determination to continue the "protracted war" by the western sea, to make the sea give way, and to make the sand bags offer grain, to make new contributions to the state, and to bring glory to Chairman Mao! The broad masses of commune members turned the barren beach into a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and into a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They fearlessly faced the fierce winds and sandstorms, and fought bravely on the western beach, where the sky is blue and the beach is barren, launching a wave of fighting the sea for land and demanding grain from the sea.

After three years of arduous struggle, people changed their thoughts and the land changed its appearance, and the thousand-year-old beach was transformed. Now, on this barren beach, a dam with a width of eight meters at the bottom, a height of three meters, and a length of over one thousand two hundred meters has been built. By using the method of pressing sand to neutralize alkali and mixing soil with sand, we have reclaimed over six hundred mu of paddy fields and over three hundred mu of dry fields. Last year alone, we increased grain production by thirty-four ten thousand catties. We also planted more than two thousand fruit trees on the barren sand beach, planted more than fifty thousand trees for windbreaks and sand fixation, and raised more than one hundred pigs. This not only greatly developed collective production and strengthened the collective economy but also supported national construction. The commune members joyfully said: "The red sun shines high in the sky, the western sea has a new look, the rice waves are golden, the trees are lush, the apple blossoms are fragrant for thousands of miles, and the pigs and cattle are happily calling in the pens."

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The struggle has made us deeply realize that the brilliant "May 7th Directive" is the fundamental policy for building a new socialist countryside and has shown us the bright road to gradually transition to communism. In the future, we must strictly follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," and turn Jinxing Brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

　　人换思想地换装　千年海滩变了样
　　辽宁省盖县熊岳公社金星大队党支部书记　徐崇让
    我们伟大的导师毛主席在“五·七”指示中指出：“公社农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化，在有条件的时候也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级。”毛主席这一伟大指示的核心，就是教导我们要永远突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想宣传农民、教育农民、武装农民。在尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，始终勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定不移地走“五·七”指示的光辉道路。
    我们大队位于熊岳镇郊，是个果、菜集中产区。从合作化以来，经受了无数次大风大浪的严峻考验，击退了资本主义势力一次又一次的猖狂进攻，使集体经济不断巩固壮大。到一九六五年春，我们大队已经拥有九眼电井、一辆汽车、一台手扶拖拉机和二十多台大胶车，在农业生产大发展的基础上，林、牧、副业也一片兴旺，收入大大增加。在这种大好形势下，我们大队广大贫下中农并不满足，决心改变人多地少、粮食不能自给的局面，学大寨人，兴大寨风，走大寨路，组织力量到西海边拦海造田。就这样，一九六五年我们排除了种种困难，把一块五百多亩的荒海滩团团地围了起来，种上了一部分水稻。但由于海滩碱性太大，秋后只收了几万斤水稻，拦海造田遭到了少数具有资本主义自发思想的人的反对。他们趁机煽风说：“西海边那个鬼地方，春天狂风恶沙，刮得人睁不开眼睛，夏天荒沙滩能烫死马蛇子，和这种地方拚，准得弄个雀飞蛋打，粮钱两空不可！”他们还当众算了一笔沾满“私”字臭味的大账：“一台大汽车拉脚，每年少说也能收入个两、三万元，再利用苗圃，多弄些苹果树苗子卖，咱就有好日子过。地少怕啥？有钱可以买国家返销粮，何必硬要到西海边拚命？这不是捧着金碗要饭吃吗？”这股风刮起来以后，有些人被这本糊涂账迷了心窍，想打退堂鼓，抓钱带粮，继续扯国家大腿。有些干部和群众也因此对拦海造田信心不足，干劲不大。
    就在这时，光辉的“五·七”指示发表了。毛主席号召农民“也要批判资产阶级”。我们发动广大社员反复学习“五·七”指示，大家认识到：农业是走大寨之路，还是走“金钱挂帅”之路，这决不是小事情，而是走不走社会主义道路的大事情。贫下中农说：“我们办的是社会主义集体经济，走的是毛主席指引的道路，决不能被几个不义之财迷糊住，走资本主义道路！毛主席教导我们‘也要批判资产阶级’，我们就要把汽车拉脚的黑主张批臭，把苗圃赚钱的坏打算批臭，坚决走大寨之路！”在反复学习《愚公移山》之后，民兵和社员们豪迈地说：“大寨打虎，我们擒龙。人家靠毛泽东思想能治住大山，我们靠毛泽东思想也能驯服大海！别看我们现在运的是沙子、黄土，以后换回来的便是粮食！”
    经过一场激烈的两条路线斗争，我们战胜了资本主义势力的猖狂进攻。广大社员坚定地表示，要继续在西海边展开“持久战”，定叫大海让路，沙包献粮，为国家做出新贡献，为毛主席他老人家争光！广大社员把荒海滩办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，当做斗私批修的战场，不怕狂风吹刮，不畏暴沙袭击，奋战在上有蓝天一顶，下有荒滩一片的西海滩上，掀起了与海争地、向海要粮的热潮。
    经过三年艰苦奋战，人换思想地换装，千年海滩变了样。如今，这块荒海滩上，筑起一条底宽八米，高三米，长达一千二百多米的拦潮大坝，采取沙压碱、土掺沙的办法，开垦六百多亩稻田和三百多亩旱田，仅去年就增产粮食三十四万斤。我们还利用荒沙滩栽各种果树两千多棵，造防护固沙林五万多棵，养猪一百多头。这不仅大大发展了集体生产，巩固壮大了集体经济，而且支援了国家建设。社员们兴高采烈地说：“红太阳高空照，西海边换新貌，稻浪一片金黄，树木成林繁茂，苹果花香千里，猪牛满圈欢叫。”
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。斗争实践使我们更加深刻地认识到，光辉的“五·七”指示，是建设社会主义新农村的根本的方针大计，给我们指明了逐步过渡到共产主义的光明道路。今后我们一定要不折不扣地照毛主席的“五·七”指示办事，把金星大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
