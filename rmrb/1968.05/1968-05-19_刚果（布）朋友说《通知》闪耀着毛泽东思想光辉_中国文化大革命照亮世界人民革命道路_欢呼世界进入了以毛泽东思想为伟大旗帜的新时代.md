Congolese (Brazzaville) worker Bouka told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is an extremely great and extremely important Marxist-Leninist document. It shines with the brilliant and invincible light of great Mao Zedong Thought.

This Congolese (Brazzaville) worker expressed his heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people on their great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the greatest and most outstanding teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao.

A Congolese (Brazzaville) friend named Gabriel, after expounding on the great historical significance of "The Notice," said that it can be affirmed that the 700 million Chinese people will definitely be able to successfully carry out the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that socialist China will never change color, as long as they resolutely implement the directives given by Chairman Mao in this "Notice."

Gabriel pointed out that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shook the world, made the imperialists and modern revisionists, headed by the United States, feel extremely anxious. However, all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world enthusiastically hail and praise the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He stressed that Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism that guides the revolution to victory. All revolutionary people of the world understand that to carry out revolutionary struggles, one must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

Gabriel concluded by sincerely wishing the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

A Congolese (Brazzaville) student named Boyonay said that the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a milestone document. It sounded the bugle for the unprecedented advance of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He said that the brilliant victories of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution announced the complete failure of the plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen to restore capitalism in China.

He said that the greatest teacher of our time, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led this Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, creatively solving a series of theoretical and practical problems in carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is an important sign that Marxism-Leninism has developed to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary people of all countries are enthusiastically hailing this.

Boyonay said that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has illuminated the revolutionary path for the people of the world, filling us with confidence in achieving revolutionary victories. This revolution has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism and revisionism and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world.

Boyonay emphasized that imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are frantically opposing the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but we, the revolutionary people of the world, enthusiastically hail the brilliant victories of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' The victory of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to all revolutionary people of the world."

Boyonay expressed his heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people for achieving even greater victories in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.
