Chairman Mao! The Working Class Is Unlimited Loyal to You

May 8, 1968, was the happiest day for the working class of the entire nation. On this day, our great leader Chairman Mao received all the revolutionary comrades attending the national railway and transportation conference in Beijing.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the great teacher of the proletariat, you are the red sun in our hearts!

Following you, our revolution has a direction.
Following you, our revolution has power.
Following you, we will always be victorious.

The revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army from the national railway and transportation lines who were received by Chairman Mao, left the reception venue still immersed in boundless joy and infinite happiness. That night, their accommodations were filled with jubilation. Everyone shouted joyfully a thousand times and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They sang in unison "The Boat Sails on Because of the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." They opened their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with deep affection, recording this unforgettable moment of happiness. Everyone held celebration meetings and discussion sessions, facing Chairman Mao's portrait to pledge: Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao to revolution for life.

The revolutionary staff representatives from the Beijing Railway Bureau, who live by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, said with great excitement after being received by Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao trusts us, the working class, the most, and he always cares for us and guides us to victory. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive guiding the revolution forward. Following Chairman Mao is victory. They decided to, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. That night, six units in this bureau that had not yet achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination realized the revolutionary three-in-one combination, thus making the entire bureau red.

"Chairman Mao clapped and waved to us, what should we do?" The revolutionary staff representatives and comrades from the People's Liberation Army of various sub-bureaus under the Shanghai Railway Bureau said in the discussion: Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving us is the greatest honor for the revolutionary staff and the People's Liberation Army support-left personnel on the railway and transportation lines. We say a thousand words, ten thousand words, in one sentence, it is to offer our red hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao! Many comrades, in the discussion, shed tears, recounting the sufferings they endured in the old society. They said: Thinking of the past sufferings, we feel even more that today's socialist society is good, and that father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao! An old worker from the Songjiang line of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, when he was a child, herded cattle for a rich farmer, who cut off a piece of his little finger with a grass-cutting knife, leaving a scar to this day. On the evening of May 8, he saw the great leader Chairman Mao. He thought: I was a poor child in the past, and an ordinary soldier in the Cultural Revolution. Why do I have such great happiness today? As he thought, he could not suppress his excitement, so he tore a piece of white cloth from his clothes and solemnly wrote a bright red "loyal" character on the white cloth, expressing his eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. Some representatives also expressed their determination: Never forget gratitude, never forget the roots, be loyal to Chairman Mao, and never change heart.

After being received by Chairman Mao, the representatives from the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory reviewed the brilliant course of the Cultural Revolution in the past two years. They said: At every critical moment, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for us, enabling us to dispel the mist and resist the waves, and achieve one victory after another in the struggle against the class enemy. At the time when the proletarian revolutionary masses most needed support, Chairman Mao sent us our comrades-in-arms, the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army firmly implemented Chairman Mao's instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and in just one week, achieved a revolutionary great alliance between the two originally opposing mass organizations, smashing the class enemy's plot to sabotage production and transportation. Soon, the revolutionary three-in-one combination was realized, and continuous victories were achieved in both revolution and production. All this is the crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Revolutionary staff representatives from Zhengzhou, Harbin, Shenyang, Lanzhou, and other places said in the discussion: Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest encouragement and greatest spur. We must carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and make transportation and production even better, using actual actions to respond to Chairman Mao's concern and expectations for us. Representatives from the Hengyang Locomotive Depot, who achieved remarkable results in "grasp revolution, promote production," after seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, with boundless happiness, immediately telephoned this great news to their comrades in Hengyang. Comrades in Hengyang said over the phone: Chairman Mao receiving you is your happiness, and it is the happiness of all our comrades in the depot. We guarantee to better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and complete the railway transportation tasks assigned by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The "grasp revolution, promote production" assault team of the Hengyang Locomotive Depot immediately requested the Ministry of Railways to increase their tasks at night. The next day, they sent out two locomotives to support the brother railway bureaus. After the representatives from the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory conveyed the most joyful news back to Qingdao, the factory workers held a celebration meeting and unanimously vowed to strive to complete the production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them.

"Seeing Chairman Mao today, remembering it for thousands of years, boiling blood to offer a red heart, forever loyal to Chairman Mao!" Many revolutionary cadre representatives who were received by Chairman Mao were particularly excited. They also expressed in the discussion: We must forever follow Chairman Mao, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further reform our worldview, closely connect with the masses, be the masses' students, and achieve new merits in revolution and production.

The representatives of the People's Liberation Army, who have made outstanding achievements in supporting the left, felt infinite happiness after seeing the great leader Chairman Mao. They said, Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest care and greatest encouragement. We must turn our proletarian feelings of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into a great force, better complete the glorious tasks assigned by Chairman Mao, and make new contributions in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and People's Liberation Army combatants executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks from the Shanghai Port Bureau and the Yangtze River Navigation Company, after being received by Chairman Mao, excitedly said: Seeing Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness, greatest honor, and most unforgettable joy of our lives. They vowed: In the future, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions. We must ensure that Chairman Mao's instructions are implemented without the slightest deviation, propagated without stopping for a moment, and defended without wavering for life. We must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, grasp class struggle, and most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call of "grasp revolution, promote production." We will be the pioneers of grasping revolution and the models of promoting production, forever advancing along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao!

　　毛主席啊！工人阶级无限忠于您
    一九六八年五月八日，是全国工人阶级最幸福的一天。这一天，我们伟大领袖毛主席接见了在北京出席全国铁路、交通会议的全体革命同志。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是无产阶级的伟大导师，您是我们心中的红太阳！
    跟着您，我们革命有方向。
    跟着您，我们革命有力量。
    跟着您，我们永远得胜利。
    受到毛主席接见的来自全国铁路、交通战线上的革命工人、革命干部和人民解放军代表，离开接见会场，仍然沉浸在无比欢乐和无限幸福之中。这一天夜晚，他们的住地到处一片欢腾，大家千遍万遍地纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。他们深情地打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，记下了受到毛主席接见的这个终生难忘的幸福时刻。大家纷纷举行庆祝会、座谈会，面对毛主席像表决心：永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
    生活在伟大领袖毛主席身边的北京铁路局的革命职工代表受到毛主席接见后，无比激动地说：毛主席最相信我们工人阶级，无时无刻不在关怀我们，指引我们胜利前进，战无不胜的毛泽东思想就是指引革命前进的火车头，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。他们决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。当夜，这个铁路局就有六个尚未实现革命三结合的单位，实现了革命三结合，从而使全局实现了一片红。
    “毛主席向我们鼓掌、挥手，我们应该怎么办？”上海铁路局所属各分局的革命职工代表和人民解放军的同志们，在座谈中都说：毛主席和林彪副主席接见我们，给了铁路、交通战线上的革命职工和人民解放军支左人员最大的光荣，我们说千言，道万语，一句话，就是要掏出红心，献给伟大领袖毛主席！许多同志在座谈中，流着眼泪，诉了他们在旧社会受的苦。他们说：想想过去的苦，越觉得今天社会主义好，越觉得爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！上海铁路分局松江线路的一位老工人，小时候给富农放牛，富农用割草刀把他小指头削掉一块，至今留着伤痕。五月八日晚，他见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他想：我过去是一个穷孩子，无产阶级文化大革命中是一个普通的战士，为什么能有今天这样大的幸福呢？他想着想着，抑制不住自己的激动，便从自己的衣衫上撕下一块白布，庄严地在白布上写下一个赤红的“忠”字，表示永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席革命到底。有的代表还表示决心说：永远不忘恩，永远不忘本，忠于毛主席，至死不变心。
    戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的代表受到毛主席接见以后，回顾了近两年来无产阶级文化大革命的光辉历程。他们说：在每一个关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席都给我们指出了方向，使我们拨开妖雾，顶住恶浪，在同阶级敌人的搏斗中，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在我们无产阶级革命派最需要支援的时候，毛主席给我们派来了亲人解放军。人民解放军坚决执行毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的指示，热情宣传毛泽东思想，在短短一个星期里，就使原来对立的两派群众组织实现了革命的大联合，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏生产和运输的阴谋。不久，又实现了革命的三结合，连续取得了革命和生产双胜利。这一切都是毛泽东思想的结晶，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
    来自郑州、哈尔滨、沈阳、兰州等地的铁路革命职工代表，在座谈中说，毛主席接见我们，是对我们最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把运输生产搞得更好，用实际行动回答毛主席对我们的关怀和期望。在抓革命、促生产中取得显著成绩的衡阳机务段的代表，见到伟大领袖毛主席以后，怀着无比幸福的心情，随即用电话把这个特大喜讯传给在衡阳的战友。衡阳的战友在电话中说：毛主席接见你们，这是你们的幸福，也是我们全段同志的幸福。我们保证更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，胜利完成毛主席和党中央交给我们的铁路运输任务。衡阳机务段的“抓革命促生产突击队”，连夜向铁道部请求增加任务。第二天，他们就派出两台机车，支援兄弟路局。青岛四方机车车辆厂的代表，把最最幸福的消息传回青岛以后，车辆厂的职工举行了庆祝大会，并且一致表示争取提前超额完成生产任务。
    “今日见到毛主席，千秋万代记心头，热血沸腾献红心，永远忠于毛主席！”受到毛主席接见的许多革命干部的代表，心情特别激动。他们在座谈中也纷纷表示：要永远紧跟毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步改造世界观，密切联系群众，做群众的小学生，在革命和生产中立新功。
    在支左工作中立下卓越功勋的人民解放军代表，见到了伟大领袖毛主席，感到无限幸福。他们说，毛主席接见我们，是对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。我们一定要把无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级感情，化为巨大的力量，更好地完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中，作出新贡献。
    上海港务局和长江航运公司的革命职工、革命干部和执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员代表，受到毛主席接见后兴奋地说：见到毛主席，是我们一生中最大的幸福，最大的光荣，最难忘的大喜事。他们表示决心：今后我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的指示。要做到贯彻毛主席的指示一丝一毫不走样，宣传毛主席的指示一分一秒不停止，捍卫毛主席的指示一生一世不动摇。我们要全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，最坚决地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战斗号召，当抓革命的闯将，做促生产的模范，永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道胜利前进！
