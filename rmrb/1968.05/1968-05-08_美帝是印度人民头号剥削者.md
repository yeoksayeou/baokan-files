The U.S. imperialists are the number one exploiters of the five hundred million Indian people, the most vicious enemy of the Indian people. For many years, the U.S. imperialists have been continuously intensifying their aggression against India from various aspects, more cunningly and treacherously pushing their neo-colonialism in India, gradually turning India from a colony of the "British Empire" into a semi-colony controlled by the new and old colonialist forces with the U.S. as the main power.

The U.S. gradually replaces the British Empire

Now, the U.S. has become India's largest creditor. By last August, the economic "aid" the United States had given India amounted to seventy-eight hundred million dollars (not including the loans from the World Bank controlled by the United States), accounting for sixty percent of the total foreign aid India received. The U.S. is now also India's largest trading partner. In the 1965-1966 fiscal year, U.S. trade with India accounted for thirty-eight percent of India's total imports and eighteen percent of its total exports; while Britain accounted for sixteen percent and eighteen percent, respectively. India has become one of the largest markets for U.S. commodities in the world.

It should be particularly noted that the main means by which the U.S. invades and controls India is the "surplus" agricultural products of the United States. An Indian economist said: "This is a lethal weapon in the American diplomatic arsenal." Taking advantage of India's continuous food shortages, the United States has been dumping "surplus" agricultural products into India, becoming the largest "donor" of food to India. Since 1951, the U.S. has dumped agricultural products worth forty-five hundred million dollars into India, accounting for fifty-eight percent of the total U.S. "aid" to India. The more U.S. agricultural products are dumped, the deeper India's agricultural crisis becomes, and the heavier its dependence on U.S. agricultural products, forming a vicious cycle. Now, the food supply in India's large and medium-sized cities is completely dependent on U.S. food.

Through "aid," the U.S. tightens control

Through the dumping of agricultural products, the U.S. has already seized half of India's total currency issuance (amounting to two hundred and seven billion rupees), controlling India's financial and fiscal system. The Indian weekly "Flash" said: The United States controls so much of India's currency, and "if the United States wants to cut a pound of flesh from India, India has to comply."

The U.S. has also, through "aid," greatly influenced the policies and plans of the Indian government. The "aid to India consortium" controlled by the United States discusses "aid" to India every year, first reviewing whether India's economic plans, national budgets, and policy guidelines meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists. Last year, the United States, through the World Bank, ordered India to devalue the rupee by thirty-six point five percent, and the Indian reactionary government completely complied, causing great harm to the Indian people.

The U.S. has sent more than one thousand five hundred "experts" and "advisors" to India through "aid," infiltrating various fields of India's economy, politics, military, and culture, forming a control network throughout India. Facing the U.S. aggression and control, the Indian weekly "Flash" exclaimed: "The new East India Company (the organization that historically invaded and occupied all of India) has appeared. It is devouring India's economic independence and freedom."

The U.S.'s ruthless plunder of India

Through "aid," the U.S. plunders India's resources and wealth, ruthlessly exploiting and plundering the Indian people.

The U.S. plunders a large amount of India's industrial raw materials and strategic resources. As early as 1951, when the U.S. Congress first discussed the issue of "aiding" India, a representative of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said with greed: "India has many materials that the United States considers 'strategic' or 'urgently needed.'" The first wheat loan agreement signed by the United States and India stipulated that India must use strategic materials such as manganese and mica to repay the loan. The more "aid" the United States provides, the more strategic materials flow to the United States from India. The former U.S. Ambassador to India, Bank, admitted in an article published in the New York Times in 1959 that three-fifths of the total amount of mica needed by the U.S. missile industry and electrical industry, one-third of the manganese sand needed by the steel industry, and half of the castor oil needed by the aircraft industry are all plundered from India.

The U.S. forces India to purchase expensive American goods, reaping excessive profits. According to U.S. regulations, eighty to ninety percent of the funds from U.S. "aid" that India receives must be used to buy American goods, and the price of American goods is usually thirty to fifty percent higher than the international market price. As a result, over the past ten years, the total value of U.S. exports to India has increased by two hundred and seventy percent, while the total value of imports has only increased by seventy percent, causing India's trade deficit with the U.S. to accumulate to one hundred and eighty-six billion rupees (equivalent to twenty-four billion eight thousand U.S. dollars), accounting for forty-four percent of India's total foreign trade deficit.

The U.S.'s methods of plundering the Indian people are varied. Every dollar the U.S. plunders from India is soaked in the blood and sweat of the Indian working people!

### 美帝是印度人民头号剥削者

　　美帝是印度人民头号剥削者
    美帝国主义是五亿印度人民的头号剥削者，是印度人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义多年来不断从各个方面加紧对印度的侵略，更加狡猾和阴险地在印度推行新殖民主义，使印度从“大英帝国”的殖民地逐步变为以美帝为主的几个新老殖民主义势力控制的半殖民地。
　　美帝逐步取代英帝
    现在，美帝已经成为印度最大的债主。到去年八月止，美国给印度的经济“援助”高达七十八亿美元（还不包括美国控制的世界银行给印度的贷款），占印度接受外援总额的百分之六十。美帝目前也已经成为印度最大的贸易主。在一九六五——一九六六年度，美帝对印度贸易分别占印度进口总额的百分之三十八，出口总额的百分之十八；而英国则分别占百分之十六和百分之十八。印度已变成美帝在全世界的最大商品输出市场之一。
    特别应当指出的是，美帝用来侵略和控制印度的主要手段是美国的“剩余”农产品。印度一位经济学家说：这是“美国外交军火库中的一件致人死命的凶器”。美国乘印度连年粮荒的机会，大举向印度倾销“剩余”农产品，成为印度最大的粮食“施主”。自从一九五一年以来，美帝向印度倾销了价值四十五亿美元的“剩余”农产品，占美国对印“援助”总额的百分之五十八。美国农产品倾销得越多，印度农业危机就越深，对美国农产品的依赖也就越重，形成恶性循环。现在，印度大中城市的粮食供应，完全依靠美国粮食来维持。
　　通过“援助”加紧控制
    美帝通过农产品的倾销，已经掌握了印度货币发行量总数的一半（达二百零七亿卢比），控制了印度的财政金融。印度《闪电》周刊说：美国掌握印度这样多的货币，它“要印度从身上割下一磅肉来，印度也得照办”。
    美帝还通过“援助”很大程度上影响着印度政府方针政策。美国控制的“援印财团”每年开会讨论“援助”印度问题时，都要首先审查印度的经济计划、国家预算和政策方针是否符合美帝的需要。去年，美国通过世界银行命令印度宣布卢比贬值百分之三十六点五，印度反动政府完全照办，给印度人民造成很大损失。
    美帝通过“援助”向印度派遣了一千五百名以上的“专家”、“顾问”，打入印度经济、政治、军事、文化各个领域，形成遍及全印度的控制网。面对美帝的侵略和控制，印度《闪电》周刊惊呼：“新的东印度公司（历史上英帝侵略和占领全印度的机构）已经出现。它正在吞食印度的经济独立和自由。”
　　美帝对印度的残酷掠夺
    美帝通过“援助”榨取印度的资源和财富，对印度人民进行着残酷的剥削和掠夺。
    美帝大量掠夺印度的工业原料和战略物资。早在一九五一年美国国会首次讨论“援助”印度问题时，众议院外交委员会代表就垂涎三尺地说：“印度拥有许多美国认为是‘战略的’或‘急需的’物资。”美国同印度签订的第一个小麦贷款协定就规定，印度必须用战略物资锰和云母来偿还。美国的“援助”越多，印度战略物资流往美国也就越多。前美国驻印度大使班克一九五九年在《纽约时报》上发表的文章承认，美国导弹工业和电气工业所需云母总量的三分之二，钢铁工业所需锰砂的三分之一，飞机工业所需蓖麻油的二分之一，都是从印度掠夺的。
    美帝强迫印度购买价格高昂的美国货，牟取超额利润。按照美国规定，印度接受美“援”款的百分之八十至九十必须买美国货，而美国货的价格通常比国际市场高出百分之三十至五十。结果，十年来，美国对印度的出口总值增加了百分之二百七十，而进口总值只增加百分之七十，使印度对美贸易的赤字累计达到一百八十六亿卢比（合二十四亿八千万美元），占印度整个对外贸易赤字总额的百分之四十四。
    美帝掠夺印度人民的办法是多种多样的。美帝从印度榨取的每一块美元都沾满了印度劳动人民的血汗！　（据新华社）
