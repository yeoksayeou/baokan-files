This year, the student movement in West Germany has not only grown in scale and momentum to an unprecedented level but has also been better organized than before, putting forward more combative slogans.

In April, Berlin and more than thirty cities in West Germany saw massive protests against the reactionary policies of the ruling cliques in West Germany and West Berlin. Over the course of five days, tens of thousands of young people and students took to the streets, bravely fighting against the large police forces sent to brutally suppress them. According to Western news agencies, the students' "fierce battles" with the police in the cities had, in some instances, "degenerated into typical street fighting." The protesting youth chanted slogans like "Down with the Fascists!" and condemned the West German and West Berlin authorities for suppressing the democratic movement. The West German Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur exclaimed that this youth and student struggle was the "most serious" in West Germany in more than a decade. In May, West German and West Berlin students held three consecutive demonstrations against the "Emergency Powers Act," protesting the West German ruling clique's attempt to forcibly pass the "Emergency Powers Act" to tighten fascist rule. On May 11, more than sixty thousand young people, students, and people from various strata in West Germany and West Berlin gathered in the West German capital of Bonn, holding the largest demonstration in West German history. The demonstrators chanted, "We want democracy, not the Emergency Powers Act!" and denounced West German Chancellor Kiesinger as a Nazi.

The U.S. imperialism, which has consistently fostered fascist forces in West Germany and West Berlin and carried out aggression worldwide, has also been a major target of the progressive student movement in West Germany and West Berlin. In mid-April demonstrations, Berlin youth attacked the U.S. imperialist institution "American House" and the U.S. spy agency RIAS radio station. Demonstrating youth in the West German port of Bremen stormed the U.S. military headquarters, tearing down the U.S. flag and hanging up red flags on the building's exterior. Since this year, large-scale demonstrations against U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam have been ongoing in West Germany and West Berlin. Students, despite police suppression, attacked U.S. imperialist institutions, burned the U.S. flag, and shouted, "Kill Johnson!" "U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the world (people)!"

Notably, in the series of demonstrations held by West German and West Berlin students this year, there have been repeated instances of people holding up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, carrying red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and wearing Mao badges.

Since the end of last year, the struggle of Italian students has been continuously developing and sweeping the nation. Their struggle is directed against the decaying educational system and the reactionary authorities who brutally suppress the student movement in Italy, and it also targets the U.S. imperialism that is ruthlessly massacring the Vietnamese people.

The most powerful struggle has been against the decaying and reactionary educational system. This struggle has rapidly spread to several dozen cities, including Rome, Milan, Pisa, Florence, Siena, Naples, and Palermo, in just a few short months. Tens of thousands of students have gone on strike and taken to the streets to hold demonstrations and marches. It is estimated that students from twenty-seven universities have joined the struggle, and students from twenty-two universities have occupied university departments, even occupying the dean's office. Many high school students have also joined the struggle. Students have established various organizations and held various discussion meetings, such as the "Student Movement and Class Struggle" discussion meeting, and have decided to offer courses on topics like the American Black problem.

The Italian authorities, frightened by the broad struggle of the young students, have repeatedly sent out large police forces and police cars to brutally suppress the students. The students, armed with stones, sticks, bricks, iron pipes, and iron bars, have bravely fought against the fully armed police and shouted, "Police, get out of the schools!" They have repeatedly repelled police attacks, and some have even seized police weapons, burned and destroyed police cars. In Rome, some young students have even posted quotations from Chairman Mao, such as "If the enemy opposes us, that is good, that means we have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy," to guide the struggle and boost morale. The students' struggle has not only gained the support of many professors and teachers but has also received the firm support of an increasing number of workers, who together participate in demonstrations, shouting, "Students and workers fight together!"

At the same time, Italian youth and students have also strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam during their demonstrations and marches. Despite the suppression by the Italian reactionary authorities, they shouted, "Vietnam will be Johnson's grave!" "Yankees go home!" and burned the U.S. flag. Students in Rome have also repeatedly stormed the U.S. embassy in Italy.

    西德学生反法西斯斗争日益高涨  意学生奋起反对腐朽的教育制度
    今年来西德学生运动不仅规模和声势空前，而且组织得比以前更好，提出了更有战斗性的口号。
    四月间，西柏林市以及西德国内三十多个城市接连爆发了强大的抗议示威，反对西德和西柏林统治集团的反动政策。在连续五天的示威中，成千上万的青年、学生走上街头，同前去野蛮镇压的大批警察进行英勇斗争。据西方通讯社报道，学生在城市中同警察进行的“猛烈搏斗”，“在有些场合下，已演变成通常的巷战”。示威青年高呼“打倒法西斯分子”的口号，并且谴责西德和西柏林当局扼杀民主运动。西德德意志新闻社惊呼，这次青年学生斗争是西德十几年来“最严重的一次”。五月，西德和西柏林学生又连续三次举行反对“紧急状态法”的示威，抗议西德统治集团企图强行通过“紧急状态法”来加紧推行法西斯统治。五月十一日，西德各地和西柏林的青年、学生和各阶层群众六万多人，集合在西德首都波恩，举行了西德历史上最强大的示威，示威者高呼“要民主，不要紧急状态法！”并谴责西德总理基辛格是纳粹分子。
    一贯积极扶植西德和西柏林的法西斯势力并在全世界进行侵略的美帝国主义，也是西德和西柏林进步学生运动的重要打击目标。在四月中旬的示威中，西柏林的青年袭击了美帝侵略机构“美国之家”和美国特务机构里亚斯电台。西德不来梅港的示威青年，冲向美国驻军总部，撕下美国星条旗，并在建筑物外面挂上红旗。今年以来，西德和西柏林青年大规模反对美帝侵略越南的示威，也此伏彼起，连绵不断。学生们不顾警察的镇压，袭击美帝的派驻机构，烧毁美国国旗，并高呼：“杀死约翰逊！”“美帝国主义是世界（人民）头号敌人！”
    特别引人注目的是，在西德和西柏林学生今年举行的一系列示威中，不断有人高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和佩戴着毛主席像章。
    意大利学生的斗争从去年年底以来不断发展，席卷全国。他们的斗争矛头直指意大利腐朽的教育制度和残暴镇压学生运动的反动当局，并且也指向了残酷屠杀越南人民的美帝国主义。
    声势最为浩大的是学生反对腐朽反动的教育制度的斗争。这个斗争在最近短短的几个月内迅速发展到罗马、米兰、彼萨、佛罗伦萨、锡耶纳、那不勒斯、巴勒摩等几十个城市。成千上万的学生纷纷罢课，走上街头举行示威游行。据统计，目前已经有二十七所大学的学生投入斗争，并且有二十二所大学学生占领了大学的院系，甚至还占领了校长办公室。许多中学生也参加了斗争。学生们自己成立各种组织，举办各种讨论会，如举办了“学生运动和阶级斗争”讨论会，并且决定开设有关美国黑人问题等课程。
    被广大青年学生的斗争吓得惊慌失措的意大利当局，多次出动大批警察和警车，野蛮地镇压学生。学生们用石块、木棒、砖头、铁管和铁棒作武器，同全副武装的警察进行了英勇搏斗，并高呼“警察从学校滚出去！”。他们多次打退了警察的进攻，有的还缴获了警察的枪支，焚烧和捣毁警车。罗马有的青年学生还张贴毛主席的“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了”等语录来指导斗争，鼓舞斗志。学生的斗争不仅得到了许多教授和教师的支持，而且还得到越来越多的工人的坚决支持，他们共同参加示威，高呼“学生和工人战斗在一起！”
    与此同时，意大利的青年、学生在示威游行中也强烈谴责美帝侵略越南的战争。学生们不顾意大利反动当局的镇压，高呼“越南将是约翰逊的坟墓！”“美国佬滚回去！”并且焚烧美国星条旗。罗马的学生还多次冲击美国驻意大利的大使馆。
