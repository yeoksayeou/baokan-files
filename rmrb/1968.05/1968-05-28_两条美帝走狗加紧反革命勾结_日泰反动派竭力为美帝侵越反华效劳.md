Two U.S. imperialist lackeys intensify counter-revolutionary collusion
Reactionary forces in Japan and Thailand eagerly serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and anti-China policies

New York Times, Tokyo — The U.S. imperialist lackey, Thai puppet regime Prime Minister Thanom, recently visited Japan, where he engaged in activities with another U.S. imperialist lackey, Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Sato, to eagerly serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and anti-China policies.

Thanom, who recently returned from Washington after paying homage to his U.S. imperialist masters, arrived in Japan on the 14th and conducted activities for a week. Accompanying Thanom were members of his puppet regime, including Foreign Minister Komar and Economic Minister Sarasin.

Thanom and Sato held a series of talks on issues such as serving the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam, strengthening anti-China efforts, and suppressing the revolutionary armed struggle of the Thai people.

In a joint statement issued on the 20th, Sato and Thanom expressed "satisfaction" with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson's counter-revolutionary strategy of playing both the war and peace cards to salvage the failing war in Vietnam. At the same time, they "sincerely hoped" that the U.S. imperialists would remain in South Vietnam indefinitely, achieving what they called a "dignified and lasting peace." This further indicates that the reactionary forces in Japan and Thailand are firmly aligned with the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in Vietnam, opposing the people of Vietnam and Asia.

The joint statement by Sato and Thanom also revealed that these two U.S. imperialist lackeys will work hard to strengthen the U.S. imperialist anti-China encirclement in Asia. According to Japanese newspapers, Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo and Thai puppet regime Foreign Minister Komar discussed joint anti-China efforts. Miki and Komar, in unison, repeated the baseless claims of the Sato government, which followed the U.S. imperialist policy of hostility towards China, about the so-called "Chinese threat." Miki even blatantly called for the "elimination" of the so-called "communist threat."

Thanom, Komar, and others expressed anxiety and fear in their public speeches in Japan about the increasingly intense revolutionary armed struggle of the Thai people. According to Japanese newspapers, Komar and Miki had secret discussions and plots to jointly suppress the revolutionary armed struggles in Thailand and Asia.

Sato and Thanom also expressed their intention to establish a "Japan-Thailand Trade Joint Committee" to strengthen their collusion.

    两条美帝走狗加紧反革命勾结
    日泰反动派竭力为美帝侵越反华效劳
    新华社东京电　美帝走狗、泰国傀儡集团总理他侬，最近到日本进行活动，同美帝的另一条走狗、日本反动政府首相佐藤加紧勾结，竭力为美帝的侵越和反华政策效劳。
    不久前到华盛顿朝见美帝主子归来的他侬，十四日到达日本，进行了为期一周的活动。随同他侬活动的还有他侬傀儡集团的外交部长科曼、经济部长沙拉信等。
    他侬同佐藤曾就为美帝侵越战争效劳、加强反华以及镇压泰国人民革命武装斗争等问题，进行了一系列会谈。
    佐藤和他侬在二十日发表的共同声明中，对美帝头子约翰逊为挽救侵越战争败局而玩弄的战“和”反革命两手策略表示“满意”，同时“衷心希望”美帝赖在南越不走，实现所谓的“体面而持久的和平”。这进一步表明，日泰两国反动派死心塌地追随美帝侵越政策，同越南人民和亚洲人民为敌。
    佐藤和他侬的共同声明还表明，这两条美帝走狗将为强化美帝在亚洲的反华包围圈而卖力。据日本报纸报道，日本外务大臣三木武夫和泰国傀儡集团外交部长科曼讨论了共同反华问题。三木和科曼一唱一和，重弹佐藤政府为追随美帝敌视中国政策而制造的所谓“中国威胁”的滥调。三木还露骨地叫嚣要“排除”所谓“共产主义的威胁”。
    他侬、科曼等在日本的公开讲话中对泰国人民日益高涨的革命武装斗争，表现了惶恐不安。据日本报纸透露，科曼和三木曾就共同镇压泰国和亚洲的革命武装斗争问题进行密谋策划。
    佐藤和他侬还表示将建立一个“日泰贸易联合委员会”，以加强双方的勾结。
