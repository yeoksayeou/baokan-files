    Farmers from the Tai Zi Wu Production Brigade in Beijing's Daxing County and revolutionary students held a rally to commemorate the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice." They pledged to firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply engage in revolutionary criticism, and root out Liu Shaoqi and all the ghosts and monsters sheltered by him. They vowed to fight them down and expose their stench, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
