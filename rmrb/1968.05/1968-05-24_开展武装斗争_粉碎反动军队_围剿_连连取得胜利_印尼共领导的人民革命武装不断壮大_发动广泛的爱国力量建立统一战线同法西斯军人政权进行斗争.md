The people's revolutionary armed forces led by the Communist Party of Indonesia are continuously growing stronger. Over the past year, they have actively launched armed struggles in the vast rural areas, mountainous regions, and forests of major islands such as Kalimantan, Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, smashing the counterrevolutionary army's repeated "encirclements" and achieving one victory after another.

In the dense forests of West Kalimantan, after the people's revolutionary armed forces raided the Sangkapura Airport and seized hundreds of boxes of weapons and ammunition in July last year, they engaged in dozens of battles with the Suharto-Nasution fascist army over the next half year, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. In the first quarter of this year, they fought dozens of battles against the reactionary army, which was sent from all over the country to "encircle" them and had the advantage in numbers and equipment. The people's revolutionary armed forces fought bravely and intelligently, continuously annihilating the enemy's fighting forces. In late March, more than 300 people from the people's armed forces fought a three-day battle against the reactionary Indonesian army in the Songkong area around Mount Blambangan, killing many enemies. Recently, the people's armed forces have also engaged in fierce battles with the reactionary army in dense jungles.

In East Kalimantan, after the people's revolutionary armed forces attacked an enemy outpost and seized a batch of weapons in December last year, they have been actively launching attacks on the enemy since the beginning of this year. In late January, a unit of the people's revolutionary armed forces fought a fierce battle with the reactionary army in the Krayan area. The head of the East Kalimantan military region, Mun Parhadimuryo, worriedly said that the people's armed forces have "increased their activities in East Kalimantan."

The revolutionary people of East Java, with a revolutionary tradition, have rapidly developed their armed forces and actively carried out guerrilla activities to eliminate traitors and local tyrants in vast rural areas. Their activities have expanded to the rural areas and suburbs of Tulungagung, Wringin, Jember, Trenggalek, Ngawi, Ngantang, Mojokerto, Malang, and Jombang. With the close cooperation of local farmers, they have executed a large number of evil landlords, local bullies, and reactionary officials. According to the reactionary Indonesian newspaper "Kami," in the few months that the people's armed forces have been active in East Java, more than 60 evil landlords, local bullies, and reactionary officials have been executed in the Tulungagung and Wringin areas alone. This newspaper revealed in mid-May that in the Wringin area, four reactionary soldiers were ambushed by the people's armed forces in the forest, with three killed on the spot and one escaping. "Kami" quoted an official, panic-stricken, exclaiming: "In some parts of East Java, there is a real danger of guerrilla warfare breaking out." According to Western news agencies, 330 patriotic soldiers and police stationed in Malang rebelled on February 15 and joined the people's revolutionary armed forces.

In some cities of East Java, the Indonesian revolutionary forces have also organized small, well-trained armed forces and actively carried out activities. According to the official mouthpiece of Indonesia, the Antara News Agency, on April 13, a squad of 25 people suddenly attacked the air force ammunition depot in Surabaya, causing the fascist military government to panic.

In the heartland of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique—West Java, revolutionary peasants have also ignited the flames of armed struggle. According to reports, armed peasants in Cirebon and Cibendung, West Java, with strong class hatred, executed several extremely evil landlords. According to another report, in late April, some peasants in the South Cianjur area of West Java organized to fight for land.

In the tightly controlled central Java, the Communist Party of Indonesia and revolutionary people are also gathering strength and actively carrying out activities. According to the reactionary Indonesian newspaper "Angkatan Bersenjata," it was revealed at the end of April that people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Indonesia have been active in the Pwade area.

The people's revolutionary armed forces in South Sumatra have also recently carried out guerrilla activities. According to the reactionary Indonesian newspaper "Pertempuran," in late March, the people's armed forces bravely attacked a village in the Pringsewu area of South Lampung, striking at the reactionary leaders and evil landlords, local bullies, and reactionary officials.

In leading the people's revolutionary armed struggle, the Communist Party of Indonesia pays attention to mobilizing broad patriotic forces, establishing a united front, and fighting against the Suharto-Nasution fascist military government.

According to reports, the Communist Party of Indonesia is "reorganizing the forces of workers and peasants in the countryside and uniting the petty bourgeoisie in the cities." "Through the establishment of a national united front, armed struggle is being carried out."

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

The continuous growth and strengthening of the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed forces have made the Indonesian fascist military government extremely terrified. The Indonesian reactionary authorities are mobilizing troops everywhere to intensify suppression and make desperate struggles, but the people's revolutionary armed forces will surely break through all difficulties, become stronger with each battle, and ultimately achieve complete victory.

    开展武装斗争　粉碎反动军队“围剿”　连连取得胜利
    印尼共领导的人民革命武装不断壮大
    发动广泛的爱国力量建立统一战线同法西斯军人政权进行斗争
    新华社二十三日讯  本社记者报道：印尼共产党领导下的人民革命武装正在不断发展壮大。一年多来，他们在加里曼丹、爪哇、苏门答腊、苏拉威西等全国主要岛屿的广大农村、山区和森林地带积极开展武装斗争，粉碎了印尼反动军队一次又一次的“围剿”，接连获得胜利。
    在山高林密的西加里曼丹，人民革命武装继去年七月奇袭山口洋机场，缴获了几百箱枪支和弹药之后，到去年年底的半年时间里，又先后同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军队进行了几十次战斗，狠狠地打击了敌人。在今年第一季度同法西斯政权从全国各地调去“围剿”的、在人数上和装备上都处于优势的反动军队进行的数十次战斗中，人民革命武装机智勇敢，不断歼灭敌军的有生力量。三月下旬，人民武装三百多人在宋孔地区布兰邦山周围同前去“围剿”的印尼反动军队进行了持续三天的激战，击毙了不少敌人。最近，人民武装又在茂密的丛林中与反动军队进行过激战。
    在东加里曼丹，人民革命武装继去年十二月袭击敌军一个哨所，缴获一批武器之后，今年以来，不断向敌人主动出击。一月下旬，一支人民革命武装在克拉延地区，同反动军队进行了一次激烈的战斗。东加里曼丹军区头目蒙·帕尔哈迪穆里约忧心忡忡地说，人民武装力量“已经增加了他们在东加里曼丹的活动”。
    具有革命传统的东爪哇革命人民，迅速地在发展他们的武装力量，积极地在广大农村地区开展锄奸灭霸的游击活动。他们的活动范围已扩展到土隆阿贡、勿里达、谏义里、任抹、外南梦、新埠头、玛琅和牙威等地区的农村和市镇郊区，在当地农民群众的密切配合下，处决了大批恶霸地主、土豪劣绅和反动官吏。据印尼反动报纸《卡米报》透露，人民武装在东爪哇活动的几个月以来，仅土隆阿贡和勿里达两地区，被处决的恶霸地主、土豪劣绅和反动官吏共有六十多人。这家报纸五月中旬透露，在勿里达地区，有四个反动军人在森林中遭到人民武装的伏击，三人当即被打死，另有一人逃脱。《卡米报》援引一名官方人士的话，惊慌失措地惊呼：“在东爪哇一些地方，存在着爆发游击战争的真正的危险。”据西方通讯社透露，驻在玛琅的三百三十名爱国官兵和警察，二月十五日举行起义，参加了人民革命武装。
    印尼革命力量在东爪哇一些城市，还组织一些短小精悍的武装力量，积极开展活动。据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社透露，四月十三日，一支由二十五人组成的武装小分队，突然袭击了在泗水市的空军军火库，吓得法西斯军人政权惊恐不安。
    在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团盘踞的心脏地区——西爪哇，革命的农民也燃起了武装斗争的烈火。据报道，西爪哇芝勒杜克和芝本多克的武装农民怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，处决了多名罪大恶极的地主。另据报道，四月下旬，西爪哇南安由地区的一些农民曾组织起来，进行夺取土地的斗争。
    在法西斯军人集团控制严密的中爪哇，印尼共产党和革命人民也在聚集力量，积极开展活动。据印尼反动报纸《武装部队报》四月末透露，在普哇达地区已发现有印尼共产党领导的人民武装进行活动。
    南苏门答腊的人民革命武装最近也积极开展游击活动。据印尼反动报纸《战斗报》透露，三月下旬，人民武装勇敢地袭击了楠榜南部普林塞伍区的一个乡，对该乡反动头目和恶霸地主、土豪劣绅进行了打击。
    印尼共产党在领导人民革命武装斗争中，注意发动广泛的爱国力量，建立统一战线，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权进行斗争。
    据报道，印尼共产党“正在农村重新有组织地组织工人和农民的力量，在城市，正在团结小资产阶级。”“通过建立民族统一战线，开展武装斗争”。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    印尼人民革命武装的不断发展壮大，使得印尼法西斯军人政权惊恐万状。印尼反动当局正在四处调动军队加紧镇压，进行疯狂的挣扎，但是人民革命武装必将冲破重重困难，越战越强，最后取得彻底胜利。
